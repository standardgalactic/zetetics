Preface
This book was written as a companion for the Course Bayesian Statistics from
the Statistics with R specialization available on Coursera. Our goal in develop-
ing the course was to provide an introduction to Bayesian inference in decision
making without requiring calculus, with the book providing more details and
background on Bayesian Inference.
In writing this, we hope that it may be
used on its own as an open-access introduction to Bayesian inference using R for
anyone interested in learning about Bayesian statistics. Materials and examples
from the course are discussed more extensively and extra examples and exer-
cises are provided. While learners are not expected to have any background in
calculus or linear algebra, for those who do have this background and are inter-
ested in diving deeper, we have included optional sub-sections in each Chapter
to provide additional mathematical details and some derivations of key results.
This book is written using the R package bookdown; any interested learners are
welcome to download the source code from github to see the code that was used
to create all of the examples and figures within the book. Learners should have
a current version of R (3.5.0 at the time of this version of the book) and will
need to install Rstudio in order to use any of the shiny apps.
Those that are interested in running all of the code in the book or building the
book locally, should download all of the following packages from CRAN:

Chapter 1
The Basics of Bayesian
Statistics
Bayesian statistics mostly involves conditional probability, which is the the
probability of an event A given event B, and it can be calculated using the
Bayes rule. The concept of conditional probability is widely used in medical
testing, in which false positives and false negatives may occur. A false positive
can be defined as a positive outcome on a medical test when the patient does
not actually have the disease they are being tested for. In other words, it’s the
probability of testing positive given no disease. Similarly, a false negative can
be defined as a negative outcome on a medical test when the patient does have
the disease. In other words, testing negative given disease. Both indicators are
critical for any medical decisions.
For how the Bayes’ rule is applied, we can set up a prior, then calculate pos-
terior probabilities based on a prior and likelihood. That is to say, the prior
probabilities are updated through an iterative process of data collection.
1.1
Bayes’ Rule
This section introduces how the Bayes’ rule is applied to calculating conditional
probability, and several real-life examples are demonstrated. Finally, we com-
pare the Bayesian and frequentist definition of probability.
1.1.1
Conditional Probabilities & Bayes’ Rule
Consider Table 1.1. It shows the results of a poll among 1,738 adult Americans.
This table allows us to calculate probabilities.
For instance, the probability of an adult American using an online dating site

can be calculated as
𝑃(using an online dating site) =
Number that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number of people in the poll
= 225
1738 ≈13%.
This is the overall probability of using an online dating site. Say, we are now
interested in the probability of using an online dating site if one falls in the age
group 30-49. Similar to the above, we have
𝑃(using an online dating site ∣in age group 30-49) =
Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number in age group 30-49
= 86
512 ≈17%.
Here, the pipe symbol ‘|’ means conditional on. This is a conditional prob-
ability as one can consider it the probability of using an online dating site
conditional on being in age group 30-49.
We can rewrite this conditional probability in terms of ‘regular’ probabilities by
dividing both numerator and the denominator by the total number of people in
the poll. That is,
𝑃(using an online dating site ∣in age group 30-49)
= Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number in age group 30-49
=
Number in age group 30-49 that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number of people in the poll
Total number in age group 30-49
Total number of people in the poll
= 𝑃(using an online dating site & falling in age group 30-49)
𝑃(Falling in age group 30-49)
.
It turns out this relationship holds true for any conditional probability and is
known as Bayes’ rule:
Definition 1.1 (Bayes’ Rule). The conditional probability of the event 𝐴con-
ditional on the event 𝐵is given by

1.1. BAYES’ RULE
9
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴& 𝐵)
𝑃(𝐵)
.
Example 1.1. What is the probability that an 18-29 year old from Table 1.1
uses online dating sites?
Note that the question asks a question about 18-29 year olds. Therefore, it
conditions on being 18-29 years old. Bayes’ rule provides a way to compute this
conditional probability:
𝑃(using an online dating site ∣in age group 18-29)
= 𝑃(using an online dating site & falling in age group 18-29)
𝑃(Falling in age group 18-29)
=
Number in age group 18-29 that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number of people in the poll
Total number in age group 18-29
Total number of people in the poll
= Number in age group 18-29 that indicated they used an online dating site
Total number in age group 18-29
= 60
315 ≈19%.
1.1.2
Bayes’ Rule and Diagnostic Testing
To better understand conditional probabilities and their importance, let us con-
sider an example involving the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the
early 1980s, HIV had just been discovered and was rapidly expanding. There
was major concern with the safety of the blood supply. Also, virtually no cure
existed making an HIV diagnosis basically a death sentence, in addition to the
stigma that was attached to the disease.
These made false positives and false negatives in HIV testing highly undesirable.
A false positive is when a test returns postive while the truth is negative. That
would for instance be that someone without HIV is wrongly diagnosed with HIV,
wrongly telling that person they are going to die and casting the stigma on them.
A false negative is when a test returns negative while the truth is positive.
That is when someone with HIV undergoes an HIV test which wrongly comes
back negative. The latter poses a threat to the blood supply if that person is
about to donate blood.
The probability of a false positive if the truth is negative is called the false
positive rate.
Similarly, the false negative rate is the probability of a false
negative if the truth is positive.
Note that both these rates are conditional
probabilities: The false positive rate of an HIV test is the probability of a
positive result conditional on the person tested having no HIV.
The HIV test we consider is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, commonly
known as an ELISA. We would like to know the probability that someone (in

10
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
the early 1980s) has HIV if ELISA tests positive. For this, we need the following
information. ELISA’s true positive rate (one minus the false negative rate), also
referred to as sensitivity, recall, or probability of detection, is estimated as
𝑃(ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has HIV) = 93% = 0.93.
Its true negative rate (one minus the false positive rate), also referred to as
specificity, is estimated as
𝑃(ELISA is negative ∣Person tested has no HIV) = 99% = 0.99.
Also relevant to our question is the prevalence of HIV in the overall population,
which is estimated to be 1.48 out of every 1000 American adults. We therefore
assume
𝑃(Person tested has HIV) = 1.48
1000 = 0.00148.
(1.1)
Note that the above numbers are estimates. For our purposes, however, we will
treat them as if they were exact.
Our goal is to compute the probability of HIV if ELISA is positive, that is
𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive). In none of the above numbers
did we condition on the outcome of ELISA. Fortunately, Bayes’ rule allows is to
use the above numbers to compute the probability we seek. Bayes’ rule states
that
𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) = 𝑃(Person tested has HIV & ELISA is positive)
𝑃(ELISA is positive)
.
(1.2)
This can be derived as follows.
For someone to test positive and be
HIV positive, that person first needs to be HIV positive and then sec-
ondly test positive.
The probability of the first thing happening is
𝑃(HIV positive) = 0.00148.
The probability of then testing positive is
𝑃(ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has HIV) = 0.93, the true positive rate.
This yields for the numerator
𝑃(Person tested has HIV & ELISA is positive)
= 𝑃(Person tested has HIV)𝑃(ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has HIV)
= 0.00148 ⋅0.93 = 0.0013764.
(1.3)
The first step in the above equation is implied by Bayes’ rule: By multiplying
the left- and right-hand side of Bayes’ rule as presented in Section 1.1.1 by 𝑃(𝐵),
we obtain
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵)𝑃(𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴& 𝐵).

1.1. BAYES’ RULE
11
The denominator in (1.2) can be expanded as
𝑃(ELISA is positive)
= 𝑃(Person tested has HIV & ELISA is positive) + 𝑃(Person tested has no HIV & ELISA is positive)
= 0.0013764 + 0.0099852 = 0.0113616
where we used (1.3) and
𝑃(Person tested has no HIV & ELISA is positive)
= 𝑃(Person tested has no HIV)𝑃(ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has no HIV)
= (1 −𝑃(Person tested has HIV)) ⋅(1 −𝑃(ELISA is negative ∣Person tested has no HIV))
= (1 −0.00148) ⋅(1 −0.99) = 0.0099852.
Putting this all together and inserting into (1.2) reveals
𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) = 0.0013764
0.0113616 ≈0.12.
(1.4)
So even when the ELISA returns positive, the probability of having HIV is only
12%. An important reason why this number is so low is due to the prevalence
of HIV. Before testing, one’s probability of HIV was 0.148%, so the positive
test changes that probability dramatically, but it is still below 50%. That is, it
is more likely that one is HIV negative rather than positive after one positive
ELISA test.
Questions like the one we just answered (What is the probability of a disease if
a test returns positive?) are crucial to make medical diagnoses. As we saw, just
the true positive and true negative rates of a test do not tell the full story, but
also a disease’s prevalence plays a role. Bayes’ rule is a tool to synthesize such
numbers into a more useful probability of having a disease after a test result.
Example 1.2. What is the probability that someone who tests positive does
not actually have HIV?
We found in (1.4) that someone who tests positive has a 0.12 probability of
having HIV. That implies that the same person has a 1−0.12 = 0.88 probability
of not having HIV, despite testing positive.
Example 1.3. If the individual is at a higher risk for having HIV than a
randomly sampled person from the population considered, how, if at all, would
you expect 𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) to change?

12
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
If the person has a priori a higher risk for HIV and tests positive, then the prob-
ability of having HIV must be higher than for someone not at increased risk who
also tests positive. Therefore, 𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) >
0.12 where 0.12 comes from (1.4).
One can derive this mathematically by plugging in a larger number in (1.1)
than 0.00148, as that number represents the prior risk of HIV. Changing the
calculations accordingly shows 𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) >
0.12.
Example 1.4. If the false positive rate of the test is higher than 1%, how, if at
all, would you expect 𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) to change?
If the false positive rate increases, the probability of a wrong positive result
increases. That means that a positive test result is more likely to be wrong and
thus less indicative of HIV. Therefore, the probability of HIV after a positive
ELISA goes down such that 𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣ELISA is positive) <
0.12.
1.1.3
Bayes Updating
In the previous section, we saw that one positive ELISA test yields a probability
of having HIV of 12%.
To obtain a more convincing probability, one might
want to do a second ELISA test after a first one comes up positive. What is
the probability of being HIV positive if also the second ELISA test comes back
positive?
To solve this problem, we will assume that the correctness of this second test is
not influenced by the first ELISA, that is, the tests are independent from each
other. This assumption probably does not hold true as it is plausible that if the
first test was a false positive, it is more likely that the second one will be one
as well. Nonetheless, we stick with the independence assumption for simplicity.
In the last section, we used 𝑃(Person tested has HIV) = 0.00148, see (1.1), to
compute the probability of HIV after one positive test. If we repeat those steps
but now with 𝑃(Person tested has HIV) = 0.12, the probability that a person
with one positive test has HIV, we exactly obtain the probability of HIV after
two positive tests. Repeating the maths from the previous section, involving
Bayes’ rule, gives

1.1. BAYES’ RULE
13
𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣Second ELISA is also positive)
= 𝑃(Person tested has HIV)𝑃(Second ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has HIV)
𝑃(Second ELISA is also positive)
=
0.12 ⋅0.93
𝑃(Person tested has HIV)𝑃(Second ELISA is positive ∣Has HIV)
+ 𝑃(Person tested has no HIV)𝑃(Second ELISA is positive ∣Has no HIV)
=
0.1116
0.12 ⋅0.93 + (1 −0.12) ⋅(1 −0.99) ≈0.93.
(1.5)
Since we are considering the same ELISA test, we used the same true positive
and true negative rates as in Section 1.1.2. We see that two positive tests makes
it much more probable for someone to have HIV than when only one test comes
up positive.
This process, of using Bayes’ rule to update a probability based on an event
affecting it, is called Bayes’ updating. More generally, the what one tries to
update can be considered ‘prior’ information, sometimes simply called the prior.
The event providing information about this can also be data. Then, updating
this prior using Bayes’ rule gives the information conditional on the data, also
known as the posterior, as in the information after having seen the data.
Going from the prior to the posterior is Bayes updating.
The probability of HIV after one positive ELISA, 0.12, was the posterior in the
previous section as it was an update of the overall prevalence of HIV, (1.1).
However, in this section we answered a question where we used this posterior
information as the prior. This process of using a posterior as prior in a new
problem is natural in the Bayesian framework of updating knowledge based on
the data.
Example 1.5. What is the probability that one actually has HIV after test-
ing positive 3 times on the ELISA? Again, assume that all three ELISAs are
independent.
Analogous to what we did in this section, we can use Bayes’ updating for this.
However, now the prior is the probability of HIV after two positive ELISAs, that
is 𝑃(Person tested has HIV) = 0.93. Analogous to (1.5), the answer follows as

14
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
𝑃(Person tested has HIV ∣Third ELISA is also positive)
= 𝑃(Person tested has HIV)𝑃(Third ELISA is positive ∣Person tested has HIV)
𝑃(Third ELISA is also positive)
=
0.93 ⋅0.93
𝑃(Person tested has HIV)𝑃(Third ELISA is positive ∣Has HIV)
+𝑃(Person tested has no HIV)𝑃(Third ELISA is positive ∣Has no HIV)
=
0.8649
0.93 ⋅0.93 + (1 −0.93) ⋅(1 −0.99) ≈0.999.
(1.6)
1.1.4
Bayesian vs. Frequentist Definitions of Probability
The frequentist definition of probability is based on observation of a large num-
ber of trials. The probability for an event 𝐸to occur is 𝑃(𝐸), and assume we
get 𝑛𝐸successes out of 𝑛trials. Then we have
𝑃(𝐸) = lim
𝑛→∞
𝑛𝐸
𝑛.
(1.7)
On the other hand, the Bayesian definition of probability 𝑃(𝐸) reflects our
prior beliefs, so 𝑃(𝐸) can be any probability distribution, provided that it is
consistent with all of our beliefs.
(For example, we cannot believe that the
probability of a coin landing heads is 0.7 and that the probability of getting
tails is 0.8, because they are inconsistent.)
The two definitions result in different methods of inference. Using the frequentist
approach, we describe the confidence level as the proportion of random samples
from the same population that produced confidence intervals which contain the
true population parameter. For example, if we generated 100 random samples
from the population, and 95 of the samples contain the true parameter, then
the confidence level is 95%.
Note that each sample either contains the true
parameter or does not, so the confidence level is NOT the probability that a
given interval includes the true population parameter.
Example 1.6. Based on a 2015 Pew Research poll on 1,500 adults: “We are
95% confident that 60% to 64% of Americans think the federal government does
not do enough for middle class people.
The correct interpretation is: 95% of random samples of 1,500 adults will pro-
duce confidence intervals that contain the true proportion of Americans who
think the federal government does not do enough for middle class people.
Here are two common misconceptions:

1.2. INFERENCE FOR A PROPORTION
15
• There is a 95% chance that this confidence interval includes the true pop-
ulation proportion.
• The true population proportion is in this interval 95% of the time.
The probability that a given confidence interval captures the true parameter
is either zero or one. To a frequentist, the problem is that one never knows
whether a specific interval contains the true value with probability zero or one.
So a frequentist says that “95% of similarly constructed intervals contain the
true value”.
The second (incorrect) statement sounds like the true proportion is a value that
moves around that is sometimes in the given interval and sometimes not in it.
Actually the true proportion is constant, it’s the various intervals constructed
based on new samples that are different.
The Bayesian alternative is the credible interval, which has a definition that is
easier to interpret. Since a Bayesian is allowed to express uncertainty in terms
of probability, a Bayesian credible interval is a range for which the Bayesian
thinks that the probability of including the true value is, say, 0.95. Thus a
Bayesian can say that there is a 95% chance that the credible interval contains
the true parameter value.
Example 1.7. The posterior distribution yields a 95% credible interval of 60%
to 64% for the proportion of Americans who think the federal government does
not do enough for middle class people.
We can say that there is a 95% probability that the proportion is between 60%
and 64% because this is a credible interval, and more details will be introduced
later in the course.
1.2
Inference for a Proportion
1.2.1
Inference for a Proportion: Frequentist Approach
Example 1.8. RU-486 is claimed to be an effective “morning after” contracep-
tive pill, but is it really effective?
Data: A total of 40 women came to a health clinic asking for emergency con-
traception (usually to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex).
They were
randomly assigned to RU-486 (treatment) or standard therapy (control), 20 in
each group. In the treatment group, 4 out of 20 became pregnant. In the control
group, the pregnancy rate is 16 out of 20.
Question: How strongly do these data indicate that the treatment is more ef-
fective than the control?
To simplify the framework, let’s make it a one proportion problem and just
consider the 20 total pregnancies because the two groups have the same sample

16
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
size. If the treatment and control are equally effective, then the probability that
a pregnancy comes from the treatment group (𝑝) should be 0.5. If RU-486 is
more effective, then the probability that a pregnancy comes from the treatment
group (𝑝) should be less than 0.5.
Therefore, we can form the hypotheses as below:
• 𝑝= probability that a given pregnancy comes from the treatment group
• 𝐻0 ∶𝑝= 0.5 (no difference, a pregnancy is equally likely to come from the
treatment or control group)
• 𝐻𝐴∶𝑝< 0.5 (treatment is more effective, a pregnancy is less likely to
come from the treatment group)
A p-value is needed to make an inference decision with the frequentist approach.
The definition of p-value is the probability of observing something at least as
extreme as the data, given that the null hypothesis (𝐻0) is true. “More extreme”
means in the direction of the alternative hypothesis (𝐻𝐴).
Since 𝐻0 states that the probability of success (pregnancy) is 0.5, we can cal-
culate the p-value from 20 independent Bernoulli trials where the probability of
success is 0.5. The outcome of this experiment is 4 successes in 20 trials, so the
goal is to obtain 4 or fewer successes in the 20 Bernoulli trials.
This probability can be calculated exactly from a binomial distribution with
𝑛= 20 trials and success probability 𝑝= 0.5. Assume 𝑘is the actual number
of successes observed, the p-value is
𝑃(𝑘≤4) = 𝑃(𝑘= 0) + 𝑃(𝑘= 1) + 𝑃(𝑘= 2) + 𝑃(𝑘= 3) + 𝑃(𝑘= 4)
.
sum(dbinom(0:4, size = 20, p = 0.5))
## [1] 0.005908966
According to R, the probability of getting 4 or fewer successes in 20 trials is
0.0059. Therefore, given that pregnancy is equally likely in the two groups,
we get the chance of observing 4 or fewer preganancy in the treatment group
is 0.0059.
With such a small probability, we reject the null hypothesis and
conclude that the data provide convincing evidence for the treatment being
more effective than the control.
1.2.2
Inference for a Proportion: Bayesian Approach
This section uses the same example, but this time we make the inference for
the proportion from a Bayesian approach. Recall that we still consider only
the 20 total pregnancies, 4 of which come from the treatment group.
The
question we would like to answer is that how likely is for 4 pregnancies to occur

in the treatment group. Also remember that if the treatment and control are
equally effective, and the sample sizes for the two groups are the same, then the
probability (𝑝) that the pregnancy comes from the treatment group is 0.5.
Within the Bayesian framework, we need to make some assumptions on the
models which generated the data. First, 𝑝is a probability, so it can take on any
value between 0 and 1. However, let’s simplify by using discrete cases – assume
𝑝, the chance of a pregnancy comes from the treatment group, can take on nine
values, from 10%, 20%, 30%, up to 90%. For example, 𝑝= 20% means that
among 10 pregnancies, it is expected that 2 of them will occur in the treatment
group. Note that we consider all nine models, compared with the frequentist
paradigm that whe consider only one model.
Table 1.2 specifies the prior probabilities that we want to assign to our assump-
tion. There is no unique correct prior, but any prior probability should reflect
our beliefs prior to the experiement. The prior probabilities should incorpo-
rate the information from all relevant research before we perform the current
experiement.
This prior incorporates two beliefs: the probability of 𝑝= 0.5 is highest, and
the benefit of the treatment is symmetric. The second belief means that the
treatment is equally likely to be better or worse than the standard treatment.
Now it is natural to ask how I came up with this prior, and the specification
will be discussed in detail later in the course.
Next, let’s calculate the likelihood – the probability of observed data for each
model considered. In mathematical terms, we have
𝑃(data|model) = 𝑃(𝑘= 4|𝑛= 20, 𝑝)
The likelihood can be computed as a binomial with 4 successes and 20 trials
with 𝑝is equal to the assumed value in each model. The values are listed in
Table 1.2.
After setting up the prior and computing the likelihood, we are ready to calculate
the posterior using the Bayes’ rule, that is,

18
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
𝑃(model|data) = 𝑃(model)𝑃(data|model)
𝑃(data)
The posterior probability values are also listed in Table 1.2, and the highest
probability occurs at 𝑝= 0.2, which is 42.48%. Note that the priors and poste-
riors across all models both sum to 1.
In decision making, we choose the model with the highest posterior probability,
which is 𝑝= 0.2. In comparison, the highest prior probability is at 𝑝= 0.5 with
52%, and the posterior probability of 𝑝= 0.5 drops to 7.8%. This demonstrates
how we update our beliefs based on observed data. Note that the calculation of
posterior, likelihood, and prior is unrelated to the frequentist concept (data “at
least as extreme as observed”).

We started with the high prior at 𝑝= 0.5, but the data likelihood peaks at
𝑝= 0.2. And we updated our prior based on observed data to find the posterior.
The Bayesian paradigm, unlike the frequentist approach, allows us to make
direct probability statements about our models. For example, we can calculate
the probability that RU-486, the treatment, is more effective than the control as
the sum of the posteriors of the models where 𝑝< 0.5. Adding up the relevant
posterior probabilities in Table 1.2, we get the chance that the treatment is
more effective than the control is 92.16%.
1.2.3
Effect of Sample Size on the Posterior
The RU-486 example is summarized in Figure 1.1, and let’s look at what the
posterior distribution would look like if we had more data.
Suppose our sample size was 40 instead of 20, and the number of successes was
8 instead of 4. Note that the ratio between the sample size and the number
of successes is still 20%. We will start with the same prior distribution. Then
calculate the likelihood of the data which is also centered at 0.20, but is less
variable than the original likelihood we had with the smaller sample size. And

finally put these two together to obtain the posterior distribution. The posterior
also has a peak at p is equal to 0.20, but the peak is taller, as shown in Figure
1.2. In other words, there is more mass on that model, and less on the others.

To illustrate the effect of the sample size even further, we are going to keep
increasing our sample size, but still maintain the the 20% ratio between the
sample size and the number of successes. So let’s consider a sample with 200
observations and 40 successes. Once again, we are going to use the same prior
and the likelihood is again centered at 20% and almost all of the probability
mass in the posterior is at p is equal to 0.20. The other models do not have
zero probability mass, but they’re posterior probabilities are very close to zero.
Figure 1.3 demonstrates that as more data are collected, the likelihood
ends up dominating the prior. This is why, while a good prior helps, a bad
prior can be overcome with a large sample. However, it’s important to note that
this will only work as long as we do not place a zero probability mass on any of
the models in the prior.
1.3
Frequentist vs. Bayesian Inference
1.3.1
Frequentist vs. Bayesian Inference
In this section, we will solve a simple inference problem using both frequentist
and Bayesian approaches. Then we will compare our results based on decisions

20
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
based on the two methods, to see whether we get the same answer or not. If we
do not, we will discuss why that happens.
Example 1.9. We have a population of M&M’s, and in this population the
percentage of yellow M&M’s is either 10% or 20%. You have been hired as a
statistical consultant to decide whether the true percentage of yellow M&M’s is
10% or 20%.
Payoffs/losses: You are being asked to make a decision, and there are associated
payoff/losses that you should consider. If you make the correct decision, your
boss gives you a bonus. On the other hand, if you make the wrong decision,
you lose your job.
Data: You can “buy” a random sample from the population – You pay $200 for
each M&M, and you must buy in $1,000 increments (5 M&Ms at a time). You
have a total of $4,000 to spend, i.e., you may buy 5, 10, 15, or 20 M&Ms.
Remark: Remember that the cost of making a wrong decision is high, so you
want to be fairly confident of your decision. At the same time, though, data
collection is also costly, so you don’t want to pay for a sample larger than you
need. If you believe that you could actually make a correct decision using a
smaller sample size, you might choose to do so and save money and resources.
Let’s start with the frequentist inference.
• Hypothesis: 𝐻0 is 10% yellow M&Ms, and 𝐻𝐴is >10% yellow M&Ms.
• Significance level: 𝛼= 0.05.
• One sample: red, green, yellow, blue, orange
• Observed data: 𝑘= 1, 𝑛= 5
• P-value: 𝑃(𝑘≥1|𝑛= 5, 𝑝= 0.10) = 1 −𝑃(𝑘= 0|𝑛= 5, 𝑝= 0.10) =
1 −0.905 ≈0.41
Note that the p-value is the probability of observed or more extreme outcome
given that the null hypothesis is true.
Therefore, we fail to reject 𝐻0 and conclude that the data do not provide con-
vincing evidence that the proportion of yellow M&M’s is greater than 10%.
This means that if we had to pick between 10% and 20% for the proportion of
M&M’s, even though this hypothesis testing procedure does not actually con-
firm the null hypothesis, we would likely stick with 10% since we couldn’t find
evidence that the proportion of yellow M&M’s is greater than 10%.
The Bayesian inference works differently as below.
• Hypotheses: 𝐻1 is 10% yellow M&Ms, and 𝐻2 is 20% yellow M&Ms.
• Prior: 𝑃(𝐻1) = 𝑃(𝐻2) = 0.5

0.5 × 0.33 + 0.5 × 0.41 ≈0.45
𝑃(𝐻2|𝑘= 1) = 1 −0.45 = 0.55
The posterior probabilities of whether 𝐻1 or 𝐻2 is correct are close to each
other. As a result, with equal priors and a low sample size, it is diﬀicult to
make a decision with a strong confidence, given the observed data. However,
𝐻2 has a higher posterior probability than 𝐻1, so if we had to make a decision
at this point, we should pick 𝐻2, i.e., the proportion of yellow M&Ms is 20%.
Note that this decision contradicts with the decision based on the frequentist
approach.
Table 1.3 summarizes what the results would look like if we had chosen larger
sample sizes. Under each of these scenarios, the frequentist method yields a
higher p-value than our significance level, so we would fail to reject the null
hypothesis with any of these samples. On the other hand, the Bayesian method
always yields a higher posterior for the second model where 𝑝is equal to 0.20.
So the decisions that we would make are contradictory to each other.
However, if we had set up our framework differently in the frequentist method
and set our null hypothesis to be 𝑝= 0.20 and our alternative to be 𝑝< 0.20,
we would obtain different results. This shows that the frequentist method is

22
CHAPTER 1. THE BASICS OF BAYESIAN STATISTICS
highly sensitive to the null hypothesis, while in the Bayesian method, our
results would be the same regardless of which order we evaluate our models.

Chapter 2
Bayesian Inference
This chapter is focused on the continuous version of Bayes’ rule and how to
use it in a conjugate family.
The RU-486 example will allow us to discuss
Bayesian modeling in a concrete way.
It also leads naturally to a Bayesian
analysis without conjugacy.
For the non-conjugate case, there is usually no
simple mathematical expression, and one must resort to computation. Finally,
we discuss credible intervals, i.e., the Bayesian analog of frequentist confidence
intervals, and Bayesian estimation and prediction.
It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concept of conditional proba-
bility and the Bayes’ rule for discrete random variables. Calculus is not required
for this chapter; however, for those who do, we shall briefly look at an integral.
2.1
Continuous Variables and Eliciting Proba-
bility Distributions
We are going to introduce continuous variables and how to elicit probability
distributions, from a prior belief to a posterior distribution using the Bayesian
framework.
2.1.1
From the Discrete to the Continuous
This section leads the reader from the discrete random variable to continuous
random variables. Let’s start with the binomial random variable such as the
number of heads in ten coin tosses, can only take a discrete number of values:
0, 1, 2, up to 10.
When the probability of a coin landing heads is 𝑝, the chance of getting 𝑘heads
in 𝑛tosses is
23

24
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
𝑃(𝑋= 𝑘) = ( 𝑛
𝑘) 𝑝𝑘(1 −𝑝)𝑛−𝑘
.
This formula is called the probability mass function (pmf) for the binomial.
The probability mass function can be visualized as a histogram in Figure 2.1.
The area under the histogram is one, and the area of each bar is the probability
of seeing a binomial random variable, whose value is equal to the x-value at the
center of the bars base.

In contrast, the normal distribution, a.k.a. Gaussian distribution or the bell-
shaped curve, can take any numerical value in (−∞, +∞). A random variable
generated from a normal distribution because it can take a continuum of values.
In general, if the set of possible values a random variable can take are separated
points, it is a discrete random variable. But if it can take any value in some
(possibly infinite) interval, then it is a continuous random variable.
When the random variable is discrete, it has a probability mass function
or pmf. That pmf tells us the probability that the random variable takes each
of the possible values.
But when the random variable is continuous, it has
probability zero of taking any single value. (Hence probability zero does not
equal to impossible, an event of probabilty zero can still happen.)
We can only talk about the probability of a continuous random variable lined
within some interval.
For example, suppose that heights are approximately
normally distributed. The probability of finding someone who is exactly 6 feet
and 0.0000 inches tall (for an infinite number of 0s after the decimal point) is 0.

2.1. CONTINUOUS VARIABLES AND ELICITING PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS25
But we can easily calculate the probability of finding someone who is between
5’11” inches tall and 6’1” inches tall.
A continuous random variable has a probability density function or pdf,
instead of probability mass functions. The probability of finding someone whose
height lies between 5’11” (71 inches) and 6’1” (73 inches) is the area under the
pdf curve for height between those two values, as shown in the blue area of
Figure 2.2.

For example, a normal distribution with mean 𝜇and standard deviation 𝜎(i.e.,
variance 𝜎2) is defined as
𝑓(𝑥) =
1
√
2𝜋𝜎2 exp[−1
2𝜎2 (𝑥−𝜇)2],
where 𝑥is any value the random variable 𝑋can take.
This is denoted as
𝑋∼𝑁(𝜇, 𝜎2), where 𝜇and 𝜎2 are the parameters of the normal distribution.
Recall that a probability mass function assigns the probability that a random
variable takes a specific value for the discrete set of possible values. The sum
of those probabilities over all possible values must equal one.
Similarly, a probability density function is any 𝑓(𝑥) that is non-negative and
has area one underneath its curve. The pdf can be regarded as the limit of
histograms made from its sample data. As the sample size becomes infinitely
large, the bin width of the histogram shrinks to zero.
There are infinite number of pmf’s and an infinite number of pdf’s.
Some
distributions are so important that they have been given names:
• Continuous: normal, uniform, beta, gamma

26
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
• Discrete: binomial, Poisson
Here is a summary of the key ideas in this section:
1. Continuous random variables exist and they can take any value within
some possibly infinite range.
2. The probability that a continuous random variable takes a specific value
is zero.
3. Probabilities from a continuous random variable are determined by the
density function with this non-negative and the area beneath it is one.
4. We can find the probability that a random variable lies between two values
(𝑐and 𝑑) as the area under the density function that lies between them.
2.1.2
Elicitation
Next, we introduce the concept of prior elicitation in Bayesian statistics. Often,
one has a belief about the distribution of one’s data. You may think that your
data come from a binomial distribution and in that case you typically know
the 𝑛, the number of trials but you usually do not know 𝑝, the probability of
success. Or you may think that your data come from a normal distribution. But
you do not know the mean 𝜇or the standard deviation 𝜎of the normal. Beside
to knowing the distribution of one’s data, you may also have beliefs about the
unknown 𝑝in the binomial or the unknown mean 𝜇in the normal.
Bayesians express their belief in terms of personal probabilities. These personal
probabilities encapsulate everything a Bayesian knows or believes about the
problem. But these beliefs must obey the laws of probability, and be consistent
with everything else the Bayesian knows.
::: {.example #200percent} You cannot say that your probability of passing
this course is 200%, no matter how confident you are. A probability value must
be between zero and one. (If you still think you have a probability of 200% to
pass the course, you are definitely not going to pass it.) :::
Example 2.1. You may know nothing at all about the value of 𝑝that generated
some binomial data. In which case any value between zero and one is equally
likely, you may want to make an inference on the proportion of people who
would buy a new band of toothpaste. If you have industry experience, you may
have a strong belief about the value of 𝑝, but if you are new to the industry you
would do nothing about 𝑝. In any value between zero and one seems equally
like a deal. This major personal probability is the uniform distribution whose
probably density function is flat, denoted as Unif(0, 1).
Example 2.2. If you were tossing a coin, most people believed that the prob-
ability of heads is pretty close to half. They know that some coins are biased
and that some coins may have two heads or two tails. And they probably also

2.1. CONTINUOUS VARIABLES AND ELICITING PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS27
know that coins are not perfectly balanced. Nonetheless, before they start to
collect data by tossing the coin and counting the number of heads their belief
is that values of 𝑝near 0.5 are very likely, whereas values of 𝑝near 0 or 1 are
very unlikely.
Example 2.3. In real life, here are two ways to elicit a probability that you
cousin will get married. A frequentist might go to the U.S. Census records and
determine what proportion of people get married (or, better, what proportion
of people of your cousin’s ethnicity, education level, religion, and age cohort are
married). In contrast, a Bayesian might think “My cousin is brilliant, attractive,
and fun. The probability that my cousin gets married is really high – probably
around 0.97.”
So a Bayesian will seek to express their belief about the value of 𝑝through
a probability distribution, and a very flexible family of distributions for this
purpose is the beta family. A member of the beta family is specified by two
parameters, 𝛼and 𝛽; we denote this as 𝑝∼beta(𝛼, 𝛽). The probability density
function is
𝑓(𝑝) = Γ(𝛼+ 𝛽)
Γ(𝛼)Γ(𝛽)𝑝𝛼−1(1 −𝑝)𝛽−1,
(2.1)
where 0 ≤𝑝≤1, 𝛼> 0, 𝛽> 0, and Γ is a factorial:
Γ(𝑛) = (𝑛−1)! = (𝑛−1) × (𝑛−2) × ⋯× 1
When 𝛼= 𝛽= 1, the beta distribution becomes a uniform distribution, i.e. the
probabilty density function is a flat line. In other words, the uniform distribution
is a special case of the beta family.
The expected value of 𝑝is
𝛼
𝛼+𝛽, so 𝛼can be regarded as the prior number of
successes, and 𝛽the prior number of failures. When 𝛼= 𝛽, then one gets a
symmetrical pdf around 0.5. For large but equal values of 𝛼and 𝛽, the area
under the beta probability density near 0.5 is very large. Figure 2.3 compares
the beta distribution with different parameter values.
These kinds of priors are probably appropriate if you want to infer the prob-
ability of getting heads in a coin toss. The beta family also includes skewed
densities, which is appropriate if you think that 𝑝the probability of success in
ths binomial trial is close to zero or one.
Bayes’ rule is a machine to turn one’s prior beliefs into posterior beliefs. With
binomial data you start with whatever beliefs you may have about 𝑝, then you
observe data in the form of the number of head, say 20 tosses of a coin with 15
heads.
Next, Bayes’ rule tells you how the data changes your opinion about 𝑝. The same
principle applies to all other inferences. You start with your prior probability

distribution over some parameter, then you use data to update that distribution
to become the posterior distribution that expresses your new belief.
These rules ensure that the change in distributions from prior to posterior is the
uniquely rational solution. So, as long as you begin with the prior distribution
that reflects your true opinion, you can hardly go wrong.
However, expressing that prior can be diﬀicult. There are proofs and methods
whereby a rational and coherent thinker can self-illicit their true prior distribu-
tion, but these are impractical and people are rarely rational and coherent.
The good news is that with the few simple conditions no matter what part
distribution you choose. If enough data are observed, you will converge to an
accurate posterior distribution. So, two bayesians, say the reference Thomas
Bayes and the agnostic Ajay Good can start with different priors but, observe
the same data. As the amount of data increases, they will converge to the same
posterior distribution.
Here is a summary of the key ideas in this section:
1. Bayesians express their uncertainty through probability distributions.
2. One can think about the situation and self-elicit a probability distribution
that approximately reflects his/her personal probability.
3. One’s personal probability should change according Bayes’ rule, as new
data are observed.
4. The beta family of distribution can describe a wide range of prior beliefs.

2.1. CONTINUOUS VARIABLES AND ELICITING PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS29
2.1.3
Conjugacy
Next, let’s introduce the concept of conjugacy in Bayesian statistics.
Suppose we have the prior beliefs about the data as below:
• Binomial distribution Bin(𝑛, 𝑝) with 𝑛known and 𝑝unknown
• Prior belief about 𝑝is beta(𝛼, 𝛽)
Then we observe 𝑥success in 𝑛trials, and it turns out the Bayes’ rule implies
that our new belief about the probability density of 𝑝is also the beta distribu-
tion, but with different parameters. In mathematical terms,
𝑝|𝑥∼beta(𝛼+ 𝑥, 𝛽+ 𝑛−𝑥).
(2.2)
This is an example of conjugacy. Conjugacy occurs when the posterior dis-
tribution is in the same family of probability density functions as the prior
belief, but with new parameter values, which have been updated to reflect
what we have learned from the data.
Why are the beta binomial families conjugate? Here is a mathematical expla-
nation.
Recall the discrete form of the Bayes’ rule:
𝑃(𝐴𝑖|𝐵) =
𝑃(𝐵|𝐴𝑖)𝑃(𝐴𝑖)
∑
𝑛
𝑗=1 𝑃(𝐵|𝐴𝑗)𝑃(𝐴𝑗)
However, this formula does not apply to continuous random variables, such as
the 𝑝which follows a beta distribution, because the denominator sums over all
possible values (must be finitely many) of the random variable.
But the good news is that the 𝑝has a finite range – it can take any value only
between 0 and 1. Hence we can perform integration, which is a generalization
of the summation. The Bayes’ rule can also be written in continuous form as:
𝜋∗(𝑝|𝑥) =
𝑃(𝑥|𝑝)𝜋(𝑝)

This is analogus to the discrete form, since the integral in the denominator will
also be equal to some constant, just like a summation. This constant ensures
that the total area under the curve, i.e. the posterior density function, equals 1.
Note that in the numerator, the first term, 𝑃(𝑥|𝑝), is the data likelihood – the
probability of observing the data given a specific value of 𝑝. The second term,
𝜋(𝑝), is the probability density function that reflects the prior belief about 𝑝.
In the beta-binomial case, we have 𝑃(𝑥|𝑝) = Bin(𝑛, 𝑝) and 𝜋(𝑝) = beta(𝛼, 𝛽).

Plugging in these distributions, we get

Γ(𝛼+ 𝛽+ 𝑛)
Γ(𝛼+ 𝑥)Γ(𝛽+ 𝑛−𝑥) × 𝑝𝛼+𝑥−1(1 −𝑝)𝛽+𝑛−𝑥−1
Let 𝛼∗= 𝛼+ 𝑥and 𝛽∗= 𝛽+ 𝑛−𝑥, and we get
𝜋∗(𝑝|𝑥) = beta(𝛼∗, 𝛽∗) = beta(𝛼+ 𝑥, 𝛽+ 𝑛−𝑥),
same as the posterior formula in Equation (2.2).
We can recognize the posterior distribution from the numerator 𝑝𝛼+𝑥−1 and
(1 −𝑝)𝛽+𝑛−𝑥−1.
Everything else are just constants, and they must take the
unique value, which is needed to ensure that the area under the curve between
0 and 1 equals 1.
So they have to take the values of the beta, which has
parameters 𝛼+ 𝑥and 𝛽+ 𝑛−𝑥.
This is a cute trick. We can find the answer without doing the integral simply
by looking at the form of the numerator.
Without conjugacy, one has to do the integral. Often, the integral is impossible
to evaluate. That obstacle is the primary reason that most statistical theory in
the 20th century was not Bayesian. The situation did not change until modern
computing allowed researchers to compute integrals numerically.
In summary, some pairs of distributions are conjugate. If your prior is in one
and your data comes from the other, then your posterior is in the same family
as the prior, but with new parameters. We explored this in the context of the
beta-binomial conjugate families. And we saw that conjugacy meant that we
could apply the continuous version of Bayes’ rule without having to do any
integration.
2.2
Three Conjugate Families
In this section, the three conjugate families are beta-binomial, gamma-Poisson,
and normal-normal pairs. Each of them has its own applications in everyday
life.
2.2.1
Inference on a Binomial Proportion
Example 2.4. Recall Example 1.8, a simplified version of a real clinical trial
taken in Scotland. It concerned RU-486, a morning after pill that was being

2.2. THREE CONJUGATE FAMILIES
31
studied to determine whether it was effective at preventing unwanted pregnan-
cies. It had 800 women, each of whom had intercourse no more than 72 hours
before reporting to a family planning clinic to seek contraception.
Half of these women were randomly assigned to the standard contraceptive, a
large dose of estrogen and progesterone. And half of the women were assigned
RU-486. Among the RU-486 group, there were no pregnancies. Among those
receiving the standard therapy, four became pregnant.
Statistically, one can model these data as coming from a binomial distribution.
Imagine a coin with two sides. One side is labeled standard therapy and the
other is labeled RU-486. The coin was tossed four times, and each time it landed
with the standard therapy side face up.
A frequentist would analyze the problem as below:
• The parameter 𝑝is the probability of a preganancy comes from the stan-
dard treatment.
• 𝐻0 ∶𝑝≥0.5 and 𝐻𝐴∶𝑝< 0.5
• The p-value is 0.54 = 0.0625 > 0.05
Therefore, the frequentist fails to reject the null hypothesis, and will not con-
clude that RU-486 is superior to standard therapy.
Remark: The significance probability, or p-value, is the chance of observing data
that are as or more supportive of the alternative hypothesis than the data that
were collected, when the null hypothesis is true.
Now suppose a Bayesian performed the analysis. She may set her beliefs about
the drug and decide that she has no prior knowledge about the eﬀicacy of RU-
486 at all. This would be reasonable if, for example, it were the first clinical
trial of the drug. In that case, she would be using the uniform distribution
on the interval from 0 to 1, which corresponds to the beta(1, 1) density. In
mathematical terms,
𝑝∼Unif(0, 1) = beta(1, 1).
From conjugacy, we know that since there were four failures for RU-486 and no
successes, that her posterior probability of an RU-486 child is
𝑝|𝑥∼beta(1 + 0, 1 + 4) = beta(1, 5).
This is a beta that has much more area near 𝑝equal to 0. The mean of beta(𝛼, 𝛽)
is
𝛼
𝛼+𝛽. So this Bayesian now believes that the unknown 𝑝, the probability of
an RU-468 child, is about 1 over 6.

32
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
The standard deviation of a beta distribution with parameters in alpha and
beta also has a closed form:
𝑝∼beta(𝛼, 𝛽) ⇒Standard deviation = √
𝛼𝛽
(𝛼+ 𝛽)2(𝛼+ 𝛽+ 1)
Before she saw the data, the Bayesian’s uncertainty expressed by her standard
deviation was 0.71. After seeing the data, it was much reduced – her posterior
standard deviation is just 0.13.
We promised not to do much calculus, so I hope you will trust me to tell you
that this Bayesian now believes that her posterior probability that 𝑝< 0.5 is
0.96875. She thought there was a 50-50 chance that RU-486 is better. But now
she thinks there is about a 97% chance that RU-486 is better.
Suppose a fifth child were born, also to a mother who received standard chip
therapy. Now the Bayesian’s prior is beta(1, 5) and the additional data point
further updates her to a new posterior beta of 1 and 6. As data comes in,
the Bayesian’s previous posterior becomes her new prior, so learning
is self-consistent.
This example has taught us several things:
1. We saw how to build a statistical model for an applied problem.
2. We could compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to inference
and see large differences in the conclusions.
3. We saw how the data changed the Bayesian’s opinion with a new mean
for p and less uncertainty.
4. We learned that Bayesian’s continually update as new data arrive. Yes-
terday’s posterior is today’s prior.
2.2.2
The Gamma-Poisson Conjugate Families
A second important case is the gamma-Poisson conjugate families. In this case
the data come from a Poisson distribution, and the prior and posterior are both
gamma distributions.
The Poisson random variable can take any non-negative integer value all
the way up to infinity. It is used in describing count data, where one counts
the number of independent events that occur in a fixed amount of time, a fixed
area, or a fixed volume.
Moreover, the Poisson distribution has been used to describe the number of
phone calls one receives in an hour. Or, the number of pediatric cancer cases in
the city, for example, to see if pollution has elevated the cancer rate above that
of in previous years or for similar cities. It is also used in medical screening for

2.2. THREE CONJUGATE FAMILIES
33
diseases, such as HIV, where one can count the number of T-cells in the tissue
sample.
The Poisson distribution has a single parameter 𝜆, and it is denoted as 𝑋∼
Pois(𝜆) with 𝜆> 0. The probability mass function is
𝑃(𝑋= 𝑘) = 𝜆𝑘
𝑘! 𝑒−𝜆for 𝑘= 0, 1, ⋯,
where 𝑘! = 𝑘×(𝑘−1)×⋯×1. This gives the probability of observing a random
variable equal to 𝑘.
Note that 𝜆is both the mean and the variance of the Poisson random variable.
It is obvious that 𝜆must be greater than zero, because it represents the mean
number of counts, and the variance should be greater than zero (except for
constants, which have zero variance).
Example 2.5. Famously, von Bortkiewicz used the Poisson distribution to
study the number of Prussian cavalrymen who were kicked to death by a horse
each year. This is count data over the course of a year, and the events are
probably independent, so the Poisson model makes sense.
He had data on 15 cavalry units for the 20 years between 1875 and 1894, inclu-
sive. The total number of cavalrymen who died by horse kick was 200.
One can imagine that a Prussian general might want to estimate 𝜆. The average
number per year, per unit. Perhaps in order to see whether some educational
campaign about best practices for equine safety would make a difference.
Suppose the Prussian general is a Bayesian. Introspective elicitation leads him
to think that 𝜆= 0.75 and standard deviation 1.
Modern computing was unavailable at that time yet, so the Prussian general
will need to express his prior as a member of a family conjugate to the Poisson.
It turns out that this family consists of the gamma distributions.
Gamma
distributions describe continuous non-negative random variables. As we know,
the value of 𝜆in the Poisson can take any non-negative value so this fits.
The gamma family is flexible, and Figure 2.4 illustrates a wide range of gamma
shapes.
The probability density function for the gamma is indexed by shape 𝑘and scale
𝜃, denoted as Gamma(𝑘, 𝜃) with 𝑘, 𝜃> 0. The mathematical form of the density
is
𝑓(𝑥) =
1
Γ(𝑘)𝜃𝑘𝑥𝑘−1𝑒−𝑥/𝜃

(2.4)
Γ(𝑧), the gamma function, is simply a constant that ensures the area under
curve between 0 and 1 sums to 1, just like in the beta probability distribution
case of Equation (2.1). A special case is that Γ(𝑛) = (𝑛−1)! when 𝑛is a positive
integer.
However, some books parameterize the gamma distribution in a slightly different
way with shape 𝛼= 𝑘and rate (inverse scale) 𝛽= 1/𝜃:
𝑓(𝑥) =
𝛽𝛼
Γ(𝛼)𝑥𝛼−1𝑒−𝛽𝑥
For this example, we use the 𝑘-𝜃parameterization, but you should always check
which parameterization is being used. For example, R uses the 𝛼-𝛽parameter-
ization by default.
In the the later material we find that using the rate parameterization is more
convenient.
For our parameterization, the mean of Gamma(𝑘, 𝜃) is 𝑘𝜃, and the variance is
𝑘𝜃2. We can get the general’s prior as below:
Mean = 𝑘𝜃= 0.75
Standard deviation = 𝜃
√
𝑘= 1

For the gamma Poisson conjugate family, suppose we observed data 𝑥1, 𝑥2, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛
that follow a Poisson distribution.Then similar to the previous section, we would
recognize the kernel of the gamma when using the gamma-Poisson family. The
posterior Gamma(𝑘∗, 𝜃∗) has parameters
𝑘∗= 𝑘+
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖and 𝜃∗=
𝜃
(𝑛𝜃+ 1).
For this dataset, 𝑁= 15×20 = 300 observations, and the number of casualities
is 200. Therefore, the general now thinks that the average number of Prussian
cavalry oﬀicers who die at the hoofs of their horses follows a gamma distribution
with the parameters below:
𝑘∗= 𝑘+
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
𝑥𝑖= 9

𝜃∗=

300 × (4/3) = 0.0033
How the general has changed his mind is described in Table 2.1. After seeing the
data, his uncertainty about lambda, expressed as a standard deviation, shrunk
from 1 to 0.047.
In summary, we learned about the Poisson and gamma distributions; we also
knew that the gamma-Poisson families are conjugate. Moreover, we learned the
updating fomula, and applied it to a classical dataset.
2.2.3
The Normal-Normal Conjugate Families
There are other conjugate families, and one is the normal-normal pair. If your
data come from a normal distribution with known variance 𝜎2 but unknown
mean 𝜇, and if your prior on the mean 𝜇, has a normal distribution with self-
elicited mean 𝜈and self-elicited variance 𝜏2, then your posterior density for the
mean, after seeing a sample of size 𝑛with sample mean
̄𝑥, is also normal. In
mathematical notation, we have

36
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
𝑥|𝜇∼𝑁(𝜇, 𝜎2)
𝜇∼𝑁(𝜈, 𝜏2)
As a practical matter, one often does not know 𝜎2, the standard deviation of the
normal from which the data come. In that case, you could use a more advanced
conjugate family that we will describe in 4.1. But there are cases in which it is
reasonable to treat the 𝜎2 as known.
Example 2.6. An analytical chemist whose balance produces measurements
that are normally distributed with mean equal to the true mass of the sample
and standard deviation that has been estimated by the manufacturer balance
and confirmed against calibration standards provided by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology.
Note that this normal-normal assumption made by the anayltical chemist is
technically wrong, but still reasonable.
1. The normal family puts some probability on all possible values between
(−∞, +∞). But the mass on the balance can never be negative. How-
ever, the normal prior on the unknown mass is usually so concentrated on
positive values that the normal distribution is still a good approximation.
2. Even if the chemist has repeatedly calibrated her balance with standards
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, she still will not
know its standard deviation precisely. However, if she has done it often
and well, it is probably a suﬀiciently good approximation to assume that
the standard deviation is known.
For the normal-normal conjugate families, assume the prior on the unknown
mean follows a normal distribution, i.e. 𝜇∼𝑁(𝜈, 𝜏2). We also assume that the
data 𝑥1, 𝑥2, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛are independent and come from a normal with variance 𝜎2.
Then the posterior distribution of 𝜇is also normal, with mean as a weighted
average of the prior mean and the sample mean. We have
𝜇|𝑥1, 𝑥2, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛∼𝑁(𝜈∗, 𝜏∗2),
where
𝜈∗= 𝜈𝜎2 + 𝑛̄𝑥𝜏2
𝜎2 + 𝑛𝜏2
and 𝜏∗= √
𝜎2𝜏2
𝜎2 + 𝑛𝜏2 .
Let’s continue from Example 2.6, and suppose she wants to measure the mass
of a sample of ammonium nitrate.

2.3. CREDIBLE INTERVALS AND PREDICTIVE INFERENCE
37
Her balance has a known standard deviation of 0.2 milligrams. By looking at the
sample, she thinks this mass is about 10 milligrams and based on her previous
experience in estimating masses, her guess has the standard deviation of 2. So
she decides that her prior for the mass of the sample is a normal distribution
with mean, 10 milligrams, and standard deviation, 2 milligrams.
Now she collects five measurements on the sample and finds that the average
of those is 10.5. By conjugacy of the normal-normal family, our posterior belief
about the mass of the sample has the normal distribution.
The new mean of that posterior normal is found by plugging into the formula:
𝜇∼𝑁(𝜈= 10, 𝜏2 = 22)
𝜈∗= 𝜈𝜎2 + 𝑛̄𝑥𝜏2
𝜎2 + 𝑛𝜏2
= 10 × (0.2)2 + 5 × 10.5 × 22
(0.2)2 + 5 × 22
= 10.499
𝜏∗= √
𝜎2𝜏2
𝜎2 + 𝑛𝜏2 = √(0.2)2 × 22(0.2)2 + 5 × 22 = 0.089.
Before seeing the data, the Bayesian analytical chemist thinks the ammonium
nitrate has mass 10 mg and uncertainty (standard deviation) 2 mg. After seeing
the data, she thinks the mass is 10.499 mg and standard deviation 0.089 mg.
Her posterior mean has shifted quite a bit and her uncertainty has dropped by
a lot. That’s exactly what an analytical chemist wants.
This is the last of the three examples of conjugate families. There are many
more, but they do not suﬀice for every situation one might have.
We learned several things in this lecture.
First, we learned the new pair of
conjugate families and the relevant updating formula. Also, we worked a realistic
example problem that can arise in practical situations.
2.3
Credible Intervals and Predictive Inference
In this part, we are going to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter by
credible intervals after incorporating the data.
Then we can use predictive
inference to identify the posterior distribution for a new random variable.
2.3.1
Non-Conjugate Priors
In many applications, a Bayesian may not be able to use a conjugate prior.
Sometimes she may want to use a reference prior, which injects the minimum
amount of personal belief into the analysis. But most often, a Bayesian will
have a personal belief about the problem that cannot be expressed in terms of
a convenient conjugate prior.
For example, we shall reconsider the RU-486 case from earlier in which four
children were born to standard therapy mothers. But no children were born

38
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
to RU-486 mothers. This time, the Bayesian believes that the probability p
of an RU-486 baby is uniformly distributed between 0 and one-half, but has a
point mass of 0.5 at one-half. That is, she believes there is a 50% chance that
no difference exists between standard therapy and RU-486. But if a difference
exists, she thinks that RU-486 is better, but she is completely unsure about how
much better it would be.
In mathematical notation, the probability density function of 𝑝is
𝜋(𝑝) =
⎧

⎨
{
⎩
1
for
0 ≤𝑝< 0.5
0.5
for
𝑝= 0.5

for
𝑝< 0 or 𝑝> 0.5
We can check that the area under the density curve, plus the amount of the
point mass, equals 1.
The cumulative distribution function, 𝑃(𝑝≤𝑥) or 𝐹(𝑥), is
𝑃(𝑝≤𝑥) = 𝐹(𝑥) =
⎧
{
⎨
{
⎩
0
for
𝑥< 0
𝑥

0 ≤𝑥< 0.5

𝑥≥0.5
Why would this be a reasonable prior for an analyst to self-elicit? One reason
is that in clinical trials, there is actually quite a lot of preceding research on
the eﬀicacy of the drug. This research might be based on animal studies or
knowledge of the chemical activity of the molecule.
So the Bayesian might
feel sure that there is no possibility that RU-486 is worse than the standard
treatment. And her interest is on whether the therapies are equivalent and if
not, how much better RU-486 is than the standard therapy.
As previously mentioned, the posterior distribution 𝜋∗(𝑝) for 𝑝has a complex
mathematical form. That is why Bayesian inference languished for so many
decades until computational power enabled numerical solutions. But now we
have simulation tools to help us, and one of them is called JAGS (Just An-
other Gibbs Sampler).
If we apply JAGS to the RU-486 data with this non-conjugate prior, we can find
the posterior distribution 𝜋∗(𝑝), as in Figure 2.5. At a high level, this program
is defining the binomial probability, that is the likelihood of seeing 0 RU-486
children, which is binomial. And then it defines the prior by using a few tricks
to draw from either a uniform on the interval from 0 to one-half, or else draw
from the point mass at one-half. Then it calls the JAGS model function, and
draws 5,000 times from the posterior and creates a histogram of the results.
The posterior distribution is decreasing when 𝑝is between 0 and 0.5, and has
a point mass of probability at 0.5. But now the point mass has less weights
than before. Also, note that the data have changed the posterior away from the
original uniform prior when 𝑝is between 0 and 0.5. The analyst sees a lot of

probability under the curve near 0, which responds to the fact that no children
were born to RU-486 mothers.
This section is mostly a look-ahead to future material. We have seen that a
Bayesian might reasonably employ a non-conjugate prior in a practical applica-
tion. But then she will need to employ some kind of numerical computation to
approximate the posterior distribution. Additionally, we have used a computa-
tional tool, JAGS, to approximate the posterior for 𝑝, and identified its three
important elements, the probability of the data given 𝑝, that is the likelihood,
and the prior, and the call to the Gibbs sampler.
2.3.2
Credible Intervals
In this section, we introduce credible intervals, the Bayesian alternative to con-
fidence intervals. Let’s start with the confidence intervals, which are the fre-
quentist way to express uncertainty about an estimate of a population mean, a
population proportion or some other parameter.
A confidence interval has the form of an upper and lower bound.
𝐿, 𝑈= pe ± se × cv
where 𝐿, 𝑈are the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval
respectively, pe represents “point estimates”, se is the standard error, and cv is
the critical value.
Most importantly, the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval on the mean
is that “95% of similarly constructed intervals will contain the true

40
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
mean”, not “the probability that true mean lies between 𝐿and 𝑈is 0.95”.
The reason for this frequentist wording is that a frequentist may not express his
uncertainty as a probability. The true mean is either within the interval or not,
so the probability is zero or one. The problem is that the frequentist does not
know which is the case.
On the other hand, Bayesians have no such qualms. It is fine for us to say
that “the probability that the true mean is contained within a given
interval is 0.95”. To distinguish our intervals from confidence intervals, we
call them credible intervals.
Recall the RU-486 example. When the analyst used the beta-binomial family,
she took the prior as 𝑝∼beta(1, 1), the uniform distribution, where 𝑝is the
probability of a child having a mother who received RU-486.
After we observed four children born to mothers who received conventional
therapy, her posterior is 𝑝|𝑥∼beta(1, 5). In Figure 2.6, the posterior probability
density for beta(1, 5) puts a lot of probability near zero and very little probability
near one.

For the Bayesian, her 95% credible interval is just any 𝐿and 𝑈such that the
posterior probability that 𝐿< 𝑝< 𝑈is 0.95. The shortest such interval is
obviously preferable.
To find this interval, the Bayesian looks at the area under the beta(1, 5) distri-
bution, that lies to the left of a value x.

2.3. CREDIBLE INTERVALS AND PREDICTIVE INFERENCE
41
The density function of the beta(1, 5) is
𝑓(𝑝) = 5(1 −𝑝)4 for 0 ≤𝑝≤1,
and the cumulative distribution function, which represents the area under the
density function 𝑓(𝑝) between 0 and 𝑥is
𝑃(𝑝≤𝑥) = 𝐹(𝑥) = ∫
𝑥
0
𝑓(𝑝) 𝑑𝑝= 1 −(1 −𝑥)5 for 0 ≤𝑝≤1.
The Bayesian can use this to find 𝐿, 𝑈with area 0.95 under the density curve
between them, i.e. 𝐹(𝑈)−𝐹(𝐿) = 0.95. Note that the Bayesian credible interval
is asymmetric, unlike the symmetric confidence intervals that frequentists often
obtain. It turns out that 𝐿= 0 and 𝑈= 0.45 is the shortest interval with
probability 0.95 of containing 𝑝.
What have we done? We have seen the difference in interpretations between the
frequentist confidence interval and the Bayesian credible interval. Also, we have
seen the general form of a credible interval. Finally, we have done a practical
example constructing a 95% credible interval for the RU-486 data set.
2.3.3
Predictive Inference
Predictive inference arises when the goal is not to find a posterior distribu-
tion over some parameter, but rather to find a posterior distribution over some
random variable depends on the parameter.
Specifically, we want to make an inference on a random variable 𝑋with probabil-
ity densifity function 𝑓(𝑥|𝜃), where you have some personal or prior probability
distribution 𝑝(𝜃) for the parameter 𝜃.
To solve this, one needs to integrate:
𝑃(𝑋≤𝑥) = ∫
∞
−∞
𝑃(𝑋≤𝑥|𝜃) 𝑝(𝜃)𝑑𝜃= ∫
∞
−∞
(∫
𝑥
−∞
𝑓(𝑠|𝜃) 𝑑𝑠) 𝑝(𝜃) 𝑑𝜃
The equation gives us the weighted average of the probabilities for 𝑋, where the
weights correspond to the personal probability on 𝜃. Here we will not perform
the integral case; instead, we will illustrate the thinking with a discrete example.
Example 2.7. Suppose you have two coins. One coin has probability 0.7 of
coming up heads, and the other has probability 0.4 of coming up heads. You
are playing a gambling game with a friend, and you draw one of those two coins
at random from a bag.
Before you start the game, your prior belief is that the probability of choosing
the 0.7 coin is 0.5. This is reasonable, because both coins were equally likely to
be drawn. In this game, you win if the coin comes up heads.

42
CHAPTER 2. BAYESIAN INFERENCE
Suppose the game starts, you have tossed twice, and have obtained two heads.
Then what is your new belief about 𝑝, the probability that you are using the
0.7 coin?
This is just a simple application of the discrete form of Bayes’ rule.
• Prior: 𝑝= 0.5
• Posterior:
𝑝∗=
𝑃(2 heads|0.7) × 0.5
𝑃(2 heads|0.7) × 0.5 + 𝑃(2 heads|0.4) × 0.5 = 0.754.
However, this does not answer the important question – What is the predictive
probability that the next toss will come up heads? This is of interest because
you are gambling on getting heads.
Fortunately, the predictive probability of getting heads is not diﬀicult to calcu-
late:
• 𝑝∗of 0.7 coin = 0.754
• 𝑝∗of 0.4 coin = 1 −0.754 = 0.246
• 𝑃(heads) = 𝑃(heads|0.7) × 0.754 + 𝑃(heads|0.4) × 0.246 = 0.626
Therefore, the predictive probability that the next toss will come up heads is
0.626.
Note that most realistic predictive inference problems are more complicated
and require one to use integrals. For example, one might want to know the
chance that a fifth child born in the RU-486 clinical trial will have a mother
who received RU-486. Or you might want to know the probability that your
stock broker’s next recommendation will be profitable.
We have learned three things in this section.
First, often the real goal is a
prediction about the value of a future random variable, rather than
making an estimate of a parameter. Second, these are deep waters, and often
one needs to integrate. Finally, in certain simple cases where the parameter can
only take discrete values, one can find a solution without integration. In our
example, the parameter could only take two values to indicate which of the two
coins was being used.

Chapter 3
Losses and Decision Making
In the previous chapter, we learned about continuous random variables. That
enabled us to study conjugate families, such as the beta binomial, the Poisson
gamma, and the normal normal. We also considered the diﬀiculties of eliciting
a personal prior, and of handling inference in nonconjugate cases. Finally, we
introduced the credible interval and studied predictive inference.
In this new chapter, we will introduce loss functions and Bayesian decision
making, minimizing expected loss for hypothesis testing, and define posterior
probabilities of hypothesis and Bayes factors. We will then outline Bayesian
testing for two proportions and two means, discuss how findings from credible
intervals compare to those from our hypothesis test, and finally discuss when to
reject, accept, or wait.
3.1
Bayesian Decision Making
To a Bayesian, the posterior distribution is the basis of any inference, since
it integrates both his/her prior opinions and knowledge and the new informa-
tion provided by the data. It also contains everything she believes about the
distribution of the unknown parameter of interest.
However, the posterior distribution on its own is not always suﬀicient. Some-
times the inference we want to express is a credible interval, because it in-
dicates a range of likely values for the parameter. That would be helpful if
you wanted to say that you are 95% certain the probability of an RU-486
pregnancy lies between some number 𝐿and some number 𝑈. And on other
occasions, one needs to make a single number guess about the value of the pa-
rameter.
For example, you might want to declare the average payoff for an
insurance claim or tell a patient how much longer he/she has to live.
Therefore, the Bayesian perspective leads directly to decision theory. And in

decision theory, one seeks to minimize one’s expected loss.
3.2
Loss Functions
Quantifying the loss can be tricky, and Table 3.1 summarizes three different
examples with three different loss functions.
If you’re declaring the average payoff for an insurance claim, and if you are
linear in how you value money, that is, twice as much money is exactly twice as
good, then one can prove that the optimal one-number estimate is the median
of the posterior distribution. But in different situations, other measures of loss
may apply.
If you are advising a patient on his/her life expectancy, it is easy to imagine
that large errors are far more problematic than small ones. And perhaps the
loss increases as the square of how far off your single number estimate is from
the truth. For example, if she is told that her average life expectancy is two
years, and it is actually ten, then her estate planning will be catastrophically
bad, and she will die in poverty. In the case when the loss is proportional to
the quadratic error, one can show that the optimal one-number estimate is the
mean of the posterior distribution.
Finally, in some cases, the penalty is 0 if you are exactly correct, but constant if
you’re at all wrong. This is the case with the old saying that close only counts
with horseshoes and hand grenades; i.e., coming close but not succeeding is not
good enough. And it would apply if you want a prize for correctly guessing the
number of jelly beans in a jar. Here, of course, instead of minimizing expected
losses, we want to maximize the expected gain. If a Bayesian is in such
a situation, then his/her best one-number estimate is the mode of his/her
posterior distribution, which is the most likely value.
There is a large literature on decision theory, and it is directly linked to risk
analysis, which arises in many fields. Although it is possible for frequentists to
employ a certain kind of decision theory, it is much more natural for Bayesians.
When making point estimates of unknown parameters, we should make the
choices that minimize the loss. Nevertheless, the best estimate depends on the
kind of loss function we are using, and we will discuss in more depth how these

3.3. WORKING WITH LOSS FUNCTIONS
45
best estimates are determined in the next section.
3.3
Working with Loss Functions
Now we illustrate why certain estimates minimize certain loss functions.
Example 3.1. You work at a car dealership. Your boss wants to know how
many cars the dealership will sell per month.
An analyst who has worked
with past data from your company provided you a distribution that shows the
probability of number of cars the dealership will sell per month. In Bayesian
lingo, this is called the posterior distribution.
A dot plot of that posterior
is shown in Figure 3.1. The mean, median and the mode of the distribution
are also marked on the plot. Your boss does not know any Bayesian statistics
though, so he/she wants you to report a single number for the number of cars
the dealership will sell per month.

Figure 3.1: Posterior
Suppose your single guess is 30, and we call this 𝑔in the following calculations.
If your loss function is 𝐿0 (i.e., a 0/1 loss), then you lose a point for each value
in your posterior that differs from your guess and do not lose any points for
values that exactly equal your guess. The total loss is the sum of the losses
from each value in the posterior.
In mathematical terms, we define 𝐿0 (0/1 loss) as
𝐿0,𝑖(0, 𝑔) = { 0
if 𝑔= 𝑥𝑖
1
otherwise
The total loss is 𝐿0 = ∑𝑖𝐿0,𝑖(0, 𝑔).
Let’s calculate what the total loss would be if your guess is 30.
Table 3.2
summarizes the values in the posterior distribution sorted in descending order.
The first value is 4, which is not equal to your guess of 30, so the loss for that
value is 1. The second value is 19, also not equal to your guess of 30, and the

loss for that value is also 1. The third value is 20, also not equal to your guess
of 30, and the loss for this value is also 1.
There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 – since
it’s equal to your guess (good news!). The remaining values in the posterior are
all different than 30 hence, the loss for them are all ones as well.
To find the total loss, we simply sum over these individual losses in the posterior
distribution with 51 observations where only one of them equals our guess and
the remainder are different. Hence, the total loss is 50.
Figure 3.2 is a visualization of the posterior distribution, along with the 0-1
loss calculated for a series of possible guesses within the range of the posterior
distribution. To create this visualization of the loss function, we went through
the process we described earlier for a guess of 30 for all guesses considered, and
we recorded the total loss. We can see that the loss function has the lowest
value when 𝑔, our guess, is equal to the most frequent observation in the
posterior. Hence, 𝐿0 is minimized at the mode of the posterior, which means
that if we use the 0/1 loss, the best point estimate is the mode of the posterior.
Let’s consider another loss function.
If your loss function is 𝐿1 (i.e., linear
loss), then the total loss for a guess is the sum of the absolute values of the
difference between that guess and each value in the posterior. Note that the
absolute value function is required, because overestimates and underestimates
do not cancel out.
In mathematical terms, 𝐿1 (linear loss) is calculated as 𝐿1(𝑔) = ∑𝑖|𝑥𝑖−𝑔|.
We can once again calculate the total loss under 𝐿1 if your guess is 30. Table 3.3
summarizes the values in the posterior distribution sorted in descending order.
The first value is 4, and the absolute value of the difference between 4 and 30
is 26. The second value is 19, and the absolute value of the difference between

Figure 3.2: L0 is minimized at the mode of the posterior
19 and 30 is 11. The third value is 20 and the absolute value of the difference
between 20 and 30 is 10.
There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 since it is
equal to your guess. The remaining value in the posterior are all different than
30 hence their losses are different than 0.
To find the total loss, we again simply sum over these individual losses, and the
total is to 346.
Again, Figure 3.3 is a visualization of the posterior distribution, along with a
linear loss function calculated for a series of possible guesses within the range
of the posterior distribution. To create this visualization of the loss function,
we went through the same process we described earlier for all of the guesses
considered. This time, the function has the lowest value when 𝑔is equal to
the median of the posterior. Hence, 𝐿1 is minimized at the median of the
posterior one other loss function.
If your loss function is 𝐿2 (i.e. a squared loss), then the total loss for a guess
is the sum of the squared differences between that guess and each value in the
posterior.
We can once again calculate the total loss under 𝐿2 if your guess is 30. Table
3.4 summarizes the posterior distribution again, sorted in ascending order.
The first value is 4, and the squared difference between 4 and 30 is 676. The
second value is 19, and the square of the difference between 19 and 30 is 121.
The third value is 20, and the square difference between 20 and 30 is 100.
There is only one 30 in your posterior, and the loss for this value is 0 since it is
equal to your guess. The remaining values in the posterior are again all different

To find the total loss, we simply sum over these individual losses again and the
total loss comes out to 3,732. We have the visualization of the posterior distri-
bution. Again, this time along with the squared loss function calculated for a
possible serious of possible guesses within the range of the posterior distribution.
Creating the visualization in Figure 3.4 had the same steps. Go through the
same process described earlier for a guess of 30, for all guesses considered, and
record the total loss. This time, the function has the lowest value when 𝑔is
equal to the mean of the posterior. Hence, 𝐿2 is minimized at the mean of the
posterior distribution.

case, you will choose to report the estimate that minimizes the loss.
• 𝐿0 is minimized at the mode of the posterior distribution.
• 𝐿1 is minimized at the median of the posterior distribution.
• 𝐿2 is minimized at the mean of the posterior distribution.
3.4
Minimizing Expected Loss for Hypothesis
Testing
In Bayesian statistics, the inference about a parameter is made based on the
posterior distribution, and let’s include this in the hypothesis test setting.
Suppose we have two competing hypothesis, 𝐻1 and 𝐻2. Then we get
• 𝑃(𝐻1 is true | data) = posterior probability of 𝐻1
• 𝑃(𝐻2 is true | data) = posterior probability of 𝐻2
One straightforward way of choosing between 𝐻1 and 𝐻2 would be to choose
the one with the higher posterior probability. In other words, the poten-
tial decision criterion is to
• Reject 𝐻1 if 𝑃(𝐻1 is true | data) < 𝑃(𝐻2 is true | data).
However, since hypothesis testing is a decision problem, we should also consider
a loss function.
Let’s revisit the HIV testing example in Section 1.1.2, and
suppose we want to test the two competing hypotheses below:
• 𝐻1: Patient does not have HIV
• 𝐻2: Patient has HIV
These are the only two possibilities, so they are mutually exclusive hypotheses
that cover the entire decision space.
We can define the loss function as 𝐿(𝑑) – the loss that occurs when decision 𝑑
is made. Then the Bayesian testing procedure minimizes the posterior expected
loss.
The possible decisions (actions) are:
• 𝑑1: Choose 𝐻1 - decide that the patient does not have HIV
• 𝑑2: Choose 𝐻2 - decide that the patient has HIV
For each decision 𝑑, we might be right, or we might be wrong. If the decision
is right, the loss 𝐿(𝑑) associated with the decision 𝑑is zero, i.e. no loss. If the
decision is wrong, the loss 𝐿(𝑑) associated with the decision 𝑑is some positive
value 𝑤.
For 𝑑= 𝑑1, we have

3.4. MINIMIZING EXPECTED LOSS FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING
51
• Right: Decide patient does not have HIV, and indeed they do not. ⇒
𝐿(𝑑1) = 0
– Wrong: Decide patient does not have HIV, but they do. ⇒𝐿(𝑑1) =
𝑤1
For 𝑑= 𝑑2, we also have
• Right: Decide patient has HIV, and indeed they do. ⇒𝐿(𝑑2) = 0
– Wrong: Decide patient has HIV, but they don’t ⇒𝐿(𝑑2) = 𝑤2
The consequences of making a wrong decision 𝑑1 or 𝑑2 are different.
Wrong 𝑑1 is a false negative:
• We decide that patient does not have HIV when in reality they do.
• Potential consequences: no treatment and premature death! (severe)
Wrong 𝑑2 is a false positive:
• We decide that the patient has HIV when in reality they do not.
• Potential consequences: distress and unnecessary further investigation.
(not ideal but less severe than the consequences of a false negative decision)
Let’s put these definitions in the context of the HIV testing example with ELISA.
Hypotheses
• 𝐻1: Patient does not have HIV
• 𝐻2: Patient has HIV
Decision
• 𝑑1: Choose 𝐻1 - decide that the patient does not have HIV
• 𝑑2: Choose 𝐻2 - decide that the patient has HIV
Losses
• 𝐿(𝑑1) = {
0
if 𝑑1 is right
𝑤1 = 1000
if 𝑑1 is wrong
• 𝐿(𝑑2) = {
0
if 𝑑2 is right
𝑤2 = 10
if 𝑑2 is wrong
The values of 𝑤1 and 𝑤2 are arbitrarily chosen. But the important thing is that
𝑤1, the loss associated with a false negative determination, is much higher than
𝑤2, the loss associated with a false positive determination.
Posteriors
The plus sign means that our patient had tested positive on the ELISA.
• 𝑃(𝐻1|+) ≈0.88 - the posterior probability of the patient not having HIV
given positive ELISA result

52
CHAPTER 3. LOSSES AND DECISION MAKING
• 𝑃(𝐻2|+) ≈0.12 - the posterior probability of the patient having HIV
given positive ELISA result, as the complement value of 𝑃(𝐻1|+)
Expected losses
• 𝐸[𝐿(𝑑1)] = 0.88 × 0 + 0.12 × 1000 = 120
• 𝐸[𝐿(𝑑2)] = 0.88 × 10 + 0.12 × 0 = 8.8
Since the expected loss for 𝑑2 is lower, we should make this decision – the patient
has HIV.
Note that our decision is highly influenced by the losses we assigned to 𝑑1 and
𝑑2.
If the losses were symmetric, say 𝑤1 = 𝑤2 = 10, then the expected loss for 𝑑1
becomes
𝐸[𝐿(𝑑1)] = 0.88 × 0 + 0.12 × 10 = 1.2,
while the expected loss for 𝑑2 would not change. Therefore, we would choose 𝑑1
instead; that is, we would decide that the patient does not have HIV.
To recap, Bayesian methodologies allow for the integration of losses into the
decision making framework easily. And in Bayesian testing, we minimize the
posterior expected loss.
3.5
Posterior Probabilities of Hypotheses and
Bayes Factors
In this section, we will continue with the HIV testing example to introduce
the concept of Bayes factors. Earlier, we introduced the concept of priors and
posteriors. The prior odds is defined as the ratio of the prior probabilities
of hypotheses.
Therefore, if there are two competing hypotheses being considered, then the
prior odds of 𝐻1 to 𝐻2 can be defined as 𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2], which is equal to 𝑃(𝐻1)
over probability of 𝑃(𝐻2). In mathematical terms,
𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(𝐻1)
𝑃(𝐻2)
Similarly, the posterior odds is the ratio of the two posterior probabil-
ities of hypotheses, written as
𝑃𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(𝐻1|data)
𝑃(𝐻2|data)

3.5. POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES OF HYPOTHESES AND BAYES FACTORS53
Using Bayes’ rule, we can rewrite the posterior probabilities as below:
𝑃𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(𝐻1|data)
𝑃(𝐻2|data)
= (𝑃(data|𝐻1) × 𝑃(𝐻1))/𝑃(data))
(𝑃(data|𝐻2) × 𝑃(𝐻2))/𝑃(data))
= (𝑃(data|𝐻1) × 𝑃(𝐻1))
(𝑃(data|𝐻2) × 𝑃(𝐻2))
= 𝑃(data|𝐻1)
𝑃(data|𝐻2) × 𝑃(𝐻1)
𝑃(𝐻2)
= Bayes factor × prior odds
In mathematical notation, we have
𝑃𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] × 𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2]
In other words, the posterior odds is the product of the Bayes factor and the
prior odds for these two hypotheses.
The Bayes factor quantifies the evidence of data arising from 𝐻1 versus 𝐻2.
In a discrete case, the Bayes factor is simply the ratio of the likelihoods of the
observed data under the two hypotheses, written as
𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(data|𝐻1)
𝑃(data|𝐻2).
On the other hand, in a continuous case, the Bayes factor is the ratio of the
marginal likelihoods, written as
𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = ∫𝑃(data|𝜃, 𝐻1)𝑑𝜃
∫𝑃(data|𝜃, 𝐻2)𝑑𝜃.
Note that 𝜃is the set formed by all possible values of the model parameters.
In this section, we will stick with the simpler discrete case. And in upcoming
sections, we will revisit calculating Bayes factors for more complicated models.
Let’s return to the HIV testing example from earlier, where our patient had
tested positive in the ELISA.
Hypotheses
• 𝐻1: Patient does not have HIV
• 𝐻2: Patient has HIV

54
CHAPTER 3. LOSSES AND DECISION MAKING
Priors
The prior probabilities we place on these hypothesis came from the prevalence of
HIV at the time in the general population. We were told that the prevalence of
HIV in the population was 1.48 out of 1000, hence the prior probability assigned
to 𝐻2 is 0.00148. And the prior assigned to 𝐻1 is simply the complement of
this.
• 𝑃(𝐻1) = 0.99852 and 𝑃(𝐻2) = 0.00148
The prior odds are
• 𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(𝐻1)
𝑃(𝐻2) = 0.99852
0.00148 = 674.6757
Posteriors
Given a positive ELISA result, the posterior probabilities of these hy-
potheses can also be calculated, and these are approximately 0.88 and
0.12. We will hold on to more decimal places in our calculations to avoid
rounding errors later.
• 𝑃(𝐻1|+) = 0.8788551 and 𝑃(𝐻2|+) = 0.1211449
The posterior odds are
• 𝑃𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃(𝐻1|+)
𝑃(𝐻2|+) = 0.8788551
0.1211449 = 7.254578
Bayes Factor
Finally, we can calculate the Bayes factor as the ratio of the posterior
odds to prior odds, which comes out to approximately 0.0108. Note that
in this simple discrete case the Bayes factor, it simplifies to the ratio of
the likelihoods of the observed data under the two hypotheses.
𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑃𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2]
𝑂[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 7.25457
674.6757 ≈0.0108
= 𝑃(+|𝐻1)
𝑃(+|𝐻2) = 0.01
0.93 ≈0.0108
Alternatively, remember that the true positive rate of the test was 0.93 and the
false positive rate was 0.01. Using these two values, the Bayes factor also comes
out to approximately 0.0108.
So now that we calculated the Bayes factor, the next natural question is, what
does this number mean? A commonly used scale for interpreting Bayes factors
is proposed by Jeffreys (1961), as in Table 3.5. If the Bayes factor is between
1 and 3, the evidence against 𝐻2 is not worth a bare mention. If it is 3 to 20,
the evidence is positive. If it is 20 to 150, the evidence is strong. If it is greater
than 150, the evidence is very strong.

It might have caught your attention that the Bayes factor we calculated does not
even appear on the scale. To obtain a Bayes factor value on the scale, we will
need to change the order of our hypotheses and calculate 𝐵𝐹[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1], i.e. the
Bayes factor for 𝐻2 to 𝐻1. Then we look for evidence against 𝐻1 instead.
We can calculate 𝐵𝐹[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1] as a reciprocal of 𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] as below:
𝐵𝐹[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1] =
1
𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] =
1
0.0108 = 92.59259
For our data, this comes out to approximately 93. Hence the evidence against
𝐻1 (the patient does not have HIV) is strong.
Therefore, even though the
posterior for having HIV given a positive result, i.e. 𝑃(𝐻2|+), was low, we
would still decide that the patient has HIV, according to the scale based on a
positive ELISA result.
An intuitive way of thinking about this is to consider not only the posteriors,
but also the priors assigned to these hypotheses. Bayes factor is the ratio of
the posterior odds to prior odds.
While 12% is a low posterior probability
for having HIV given a positive ELISA result, this value is still much higher
than the overall prevalence of HIV in the population (in other words, the prior
probability for that hypothesis).
Another commonly used scale for interpreting Bayes factors is proposed by Kass
and Raftery (1995), and it deals with the natural logarithm of the calculated
Bayes factor. The values can be interpreted in Table 3.6.
Reporting of the log scale can be helpful for numerical accuracy reasons when

56
CHAPTER 3. LOSSES AND DECISION MAKING
the likelihoods are very small. Taking two times the natural logarithm of the
Bayes factor we calculated earlier, we would end up with the same decision that
the evidence against 𝐻1 is strong.
2 × log(92.59259) = 9.056418
To recap, we defined prior odds, posterior odds, and the Bayes factor.
We
learned about scales by which we can interpret these values for model selection.
We also re-emphasize that in Bayesian testing, the order in which we evaluate
the models of hypotheses does not matter. The Bayes factor of 𝐻2 versus 𝐻1,
𝐵𝐹[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1], is simply the reciprocal of the Bayes factor for 𝐻1 versus 𝐻2, that
is, 𝐵𝐹[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2].

Chapter 4
Inference and
Decision-Making with
Multiple Parameters
We saw in 2.2.3 that if the data followed a normal distribution and that the
variance was known, that the normal distribution was the conjugate prior dis-
tribution for the unknown mean. In this chapter, we will focus on the situation
when the data follow a normal distribution with an unknown mean, but now
consider the case where the variance is also unknown. When the variance 𝜎2 of
the data is also unknown, we need to specify a joint prior distribution 𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2) for
both the mean 𝜇and the variance 𝜎2. We will introduce the conjugate normal-
gamma family of distributions where the posterior distribution is in the same
family as the prior distribution and leads to a marginal Student t distribution
for posterior inference for the mean of the population.
We will present Monte Carlo simulation for inference about functions of the
parameters as well as sampling from predictive distributions, which can also be
used to assist with prior elicitation. For situations when limited prior infor-
mation is available, we discuss a limiting case of the normal-gamma conjugate
family, the reference prior, leading to a prior that can be used for a default or
reference analysis. Finally, we will show how to create a more flexible and robust
prior distribution by using mixtures of the normal-gamma conjugate prior, the
Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow prior. For inference in this case we will introduce Markov
Chain Monte Carlo, a powerful simulation method for Bayesian inference.
It is assumed that the readers have mastered the concepts of one-parameter
normal-normal conjugate priors. Calculus is not required for this section; how-
ever, for those who are comfortable with calculus and would like to go deeper,
we shall present optional sections with more details on the derivations.

4.1
The Normal-Gamma Conjugate Family
You may take the safety of your drinking water for granted, however, residents
of Flint, Michigan were outraged over reports that the levels of a contaminant
known as TTHM exceeded federal allowance levels in 2014. TTHM stands for
total trihalomethanes, a group of chemical compounds first identified in drink-
ing water in the 1970’s. Trihalomethanes are formed as a by-product from the
reaction of chlorine or bromine with organic matter present in the water being
disinfected for drinking.
THMs have been associated through epidemiologi-
cal studies with some adverse health effects and many are considered carcino-
genic. In the United States, the EPA limits the total concentration of the four
chief constituents (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichloromethane, and dibro-
mochloromethane), referred to as total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 parts
per billion in treated water.
Since violations are based on annual running averages, we are interested in infer-
ence about the mean TTHM level based on measurements taken from samples.
In Section 2.2.3 we described the normal-normal conjugate family for inference
about an unknown mean 𝜇when the data 𝑌1, 𝑌2, … , 𝑌𝑛were assumed to be
a random sample of size 𝑛from a normal population with a known standard
deviation 𝜎, however, it is more common in practice to have data where the
variability of observations is unknown, as in the example with TTHM. Con-
ceptually, Bayesian inference for two (or more) parameters is not any different
from the case with one parameter. As both 𝜇and 𝜎2 unknown, we will need
to specify a joint prior distribution, 𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2) to describe our prior uncertainty
about them. As before, Bayes Theorem leads to the posterior distribution for
𝜇and 𝜎2 given the observed data to take the form
𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2 ∣𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛) = 𝑝(𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛∣𝜇, 𝜎2) × 𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2)
normalizing constant
.
(4.1)
The likelihood function for 𝜇, 𝜎2 is proportional to the sampling distribution
of the data, 𝐿(𝜇, 𝜎2) ∝𝑝(𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛∣𝜇, 𝜎2) so that the posterior distribution can
be re-expressed in proportional form
𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2 ∣𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛) ∝𝐿(𝜇, 𝜎2)𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2).
(4.2)
As in the earlier chapters, conjugate priors are appealing as there are nice expres-
sions for updating the prior to obtain the posterior distribution using summaries
of the data. In the case of two parameters or more parameters a conjugate pair

4.1. THE NORMAL-GAMMA CONJUGATE FAMILY
59
is a sampling model for the data and a joint prior distribution for the unknown
parameters such that the joint posterior distribution is in the same family of
distributions as the prior distribution. In this case our sampling model is built
on the assumption that the data are a random sample of size 𝑛from a normal
population with mean 𝜇and variance 𝜎2, expressed in shorthand as
𝑌1, … 𝑌𝑛
iid
∼Normal(𝜇, 𝜎2)
where the ‘iid’ above the distribution symbol ‘∼’ indicates that each of the
observations are independent of the others (given 𝜇and 𝜎2) and are identically
distributed. Under this assumption, the sampling distribution of the data is the
product of independent normal distributions with mean 𝜇and variance 𝜎2,
𝑝(𝑦1, … , 𝑦𝑛∣𝜇, 𝜎2) =
𝑛
∏
𝑖=1

2𝜋𝜎2 𝑒
{−1

(4.3)
which, after some algebraic manipulation and simplification, leads to a likelihood
function for 𝜇and 𝜎2 that is proportional to
𝐿(𝜇, 𝜎2) ∝(𝜎2)−𝑛/2 × exp {−1

∑
𝑛

function of 𝜎2 and data × function of 𝜇, 𝜎2 and data
which depends on the data only through the sum of squares ∑
𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−̄𝑦)2 (or
equivalently the sample variance 𝑠2 = ∑
𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−
̄𝑦)2/(𝑛−1)) and the sample
mean
̄𝑦. From the expression for the likelihood, we can see that the likelihood
factors into two pieces: a term that is a function of 𝜎2 and the data; and a term
that involves 𝜇, 𝜎2 and the data.
Based on the factorization in the likelihood and the fact that any joint distri-
bution for 𝜇and 𝜎2 can be expressed as
𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2) = 𝑝(𝜇∣𝜎2) × 𝑝(𝜎2)
as the product of a conditional distribution for 𝜇given 𝜎2 and a marginal
distribution for 𝜎2, this suggests that the posterior distribution should factor
as the product of two conjugate distributions. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is
indeed the case.
4.1.1
Conjugate Prior for 𝜇and 𝜎2
In Section 2.2.3, we found that for normal data, the conjugate prior distribution
for 𝜇when the standard deviation 𝜎was known was a normal distribution. We
will build on this to specify a conditional prior distribution for 𝜇as a normal
distribution
𝜇∣𝜎2 ∼N(𝑚0, 𝜎2/𝑛0)
(4.4)

60CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
with hyper-parameters 𝑚0, the prior mean for 𝜇, and 𝜎2/𝑛0 the prior variance.
While previously we represented the prior variance as a fixed constant, 𝜏2, in
this case we will replace 𝜏2 with a multiple of 𝜎2. Because 𝜎has the same
units as the data, the presence of 𝜎in the prior variance automatically scales
the prior for 𝜇based on the same units. This is important, for example, if we
were to change the measurement units from inches to centimeters or seconds to
hours, as the prior will be re-scaled automatically. The hyper-parameter 𝑛0 is
unitless, but is used to express our prior precision about 𝜇relative to the level
of “noise”, captured by 𝜎2, in the data. Larger values of 𝑛0 indicate that we
know the mean with more precision (relative to the variability in observations)
with smaller values indicating less precision or more uncertainty. We will see
later how the hyper-parameter 𝑛0 may be interpreted as a prior sample size.
Finally, while we could use a fixed value 𝜏2 as the prior variance in a conditional
conjugate prior for 𝜇given 𝜎2, that does not lead to a joint conjugate prior for
𝜇and 𝜎2.
As 𝜎2 is unknown, a Bayesian would use a prior distribution to describe the
uncertainty about the variance before seeing data. Since the variance is non-
negative, continuous, and with no upper limit, based on the distributions that
we have seen so far a gamma distribution might appear to be a candidate prior
for the variance,. However, that choice does not lead to a posterior distribution
in the same family or that is recognizable as any common distribution. It turns
out that the the inverse of the variance, which is known as the precision, has a
conjugate gamma prior distribution.
For simplification let’s express the precision (inverse variance) as a new param-
eter, 𝜙= 1/𝜎2. Then the conjugate prior for 𝜙,
𝜙∼Gamma (𝑣0
2 , 𝑣0𝑠2
0
2 )
(4.5)
is a gamma distribution with shape parameter 𝑣0/2 and rate parameter of
𝑣0𝑠2
0/2. Given the connections between the gamma distribution and the Chi-
Squared distribution, the hyper-parameter 𝑣0 may be interpreted as the prior
degrees of freedom.
The hyper-parameter 𝑠2
0 may be interpreted as a prior
variance or initial prior estimate for 𝜎2.
Equivalently, we may say that the
inverse of the variance has a
1/𝜎2 ∼Gamma(𝑣0/2, 𝑠2
0𝑣0/2)
gamma distribution to avoid using a new symbol 1. Together the conditional
normal distribution for 𝜇given 𝜎2 in (4.4) and the marginal gamma distribution
1In some other references, you will see that 𝜎2 will have an inverse gamma distribution.
Rather than introduce an additional distribution for the inverse-gamma, we will restrict our
attention to the gamma distribution since the inverse-gamma is equivalent to saying that the
inverse of 𝜎2 has a gamma distribution and ‘R‘ has support for generating random variables
from the gamma that we will need in later sections.

4.1. THE NORMAL-GAMMA CONJUGATE FAMILY
61
for 𝜙in (4.5) lead to a joint distribution for the pair (𝜇, 𝜙) that we will call the
normal-gamma family of distributions:
(𝜇, 𝜙) ∼NormalGamma(𝑚0, 𝑛0, 𝑠2
0, 𝑣0)
(4.6)
with the four hyper-parameters 𝑚0, 𝑛0, 𝑠2
0, and 𝑣0.
We can obtain the density for the Normal-Gamma(𝑚0, 𝑛0, 𝜈0, 𝑠2
0) family of distri-
butions for 𝜇, 𝜙by multiplying the conditional normal distribution for 𝜇times
the marginal gamma distribution for 𝜙:

(4.7)
The joint conjugate prior has simple rules for updating the prior hyper-
parameters given new data to obtain the posterior hyper-parameters due to
conjugacy.
4.1.2
Conjugate Posterior Distribution
As a conjugate family, the posterior distribution of the pair of parameters (𝜇, 𝜙)
is in the same family as the prior distribution when the sample data arise from
a normal distribution, that is the posterior is also normal-gamma
(𝜇, 𝜙) ∣data ∼NormalGamma(𝑚𝑛, 𝑛𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛, 𝑣𝑛)
(4.8)
where the subscript 𝑛on the hyper-parameters indicates the updated values
after seeing the 𝑛observations from the sample data. One attraction of conju-
gate families is there are relatively simple updating rules for obtaining the new
hyper-parameters:
𝑚𝑛
=
𝑛̄𝑌+ 𝑛0𝑚0
𝑛+ 𝑛0
𝑛𝑛
=
𝑛0 + 𝑛
𝑣𝑛
=
𝑣0 + 𝑛
𝑠2
𝑛
=
1
𝑣𝑛
[𝑠2(𝑛−1) + 𝑠2
0𝑣0 + 𝑛0𝑛
𝑛𝑛
( ̄𝑦−𝑚0)2] .
Let’s look more closely to try to understand the updating rules. The updated
hyper-parameter 𝑚𝑛is the posterior mean for 𝜇; it is also the mode and median.
The posterior mean 𝑚𝑛is a weighted average of the sample mean
̄𝑦and prior
mean 𝑚0 with weights 𝑛/(𝑛+ 𝑛0 and 𝑛0/(𝑛+ 𝑛0) that are proportional to the
precision in the data, 𝑛, and the prior precision, 𝑛0, respectively.
The posterior sample size 𝑛𝑛is the sum of the prior sample size 𝑛0 and the
sample size 𝑛, representing the combined precision after seeing the data for

62CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
the posterior distribution for 𝜇. The posterior degrees of freedom 𝑣𝑛are also
increased by adding the sample size 𝑛to the prior degrees of freedom 𝑣0.
Finally, the posterior variance hyper-parameter 𝑠2
𝑛combines three sources of
information about 𝜎2 in terms of sums of squared deviations. The first term in
the square brackets is the sample variance times the sample degrees of freedom,
𝑠2(𝑛−1) = ∑
𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−
̄𝑦)2, which is the sample sum of squares. Similarly, we
may view the second term as a sum of squares based on prior data, where 𝑠2
0
was an estimate of 𝜎2. The squared difference of the sample mean and prior
mean in the last term also provides an estimate of 𝜎2, where a large value of
( ̄𝑦−𝜇0)2 increases the posterior sum of squares 𝑣𝑛𝑠2
𝑛.
If the sample mean is far from our prior mean, this increases the probability
that 𝜎2 is large. Adding these three sum of squares provides the posterior sum
of square, and dividing by the posterior posterior degrees of freedom we obtain
the new hyper-parameter 𝑠2
𝑛, which is an estimate of 𝜎2 combining the sources
of variation from the prior and the data.
The joint posterior distribution for the pair 𝜇and 𝜙
(𝜇, 𝜙) ∣data ∼NormalGamma(𝑚𝑛, 𝑛𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛, 𝑣𝑛)
is in the normal-gamma family, and is equivalent to a hierarchical model
specified in two stages: in the first stage of the hierarchy the inverse variance
or precision marginally has a gamma distribution,
1/𝜎2 ∣data ∼Gamma(𝑣𝑛/2, 𝑠2
𝑛𝑣𝑛/2)
and in the second stage, 𝜇given 𝜎
𝜇∣data, 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝑚𝑛, 𝜎2/𝑛𝑛)
has a conditional normal distribution. We will see in the next chapter how this
representation is convenient for generating samples from the posterior distribu-
tion.
4.1.3
Marginal Distribution for 𝜇: Student 𝑡
The joint normal-gamma posterior summarizes our current knowledge about 𝜇
and 𝜎2, however, we are generally interested in inference about 𝜇uncondition-
ally as 𝜎2 is unknown. This marginal inference requires the unconditional or
marginal distribution of 𝜇that ‘averages’ over the uncertainty in 𝜎. For con-
tinuous variables like 𝜎, this averaging is performed by integration leading to a
Student 𝑡distribution.
The standardized Student 𝑡-distribution t𝜈with 𝜈degrees of freedom is defined
to be
𝑝(𝑡) =

√𝜋𝜈
Γ( 𝜈+1
2 )
Γ( 𝜈

𝜈)
−𝜈+1

4.1. THE NORMAL-GAMMA CONJUGATE FAMILY
63
where the Γ(⋅) is the Gamma function defined earlier in Equation (2.4). The
standard Student’s 𝑡-distribution is centered at 0 (the location parameter), with
a scale parameter equal to 1, like in a standard normal, however, there is an
additional parameter, 𝜈, the degrees of freedom parameter.
The Student 𝑡distribution is similar to the normal distribution as it is symmetric
about the center and bell shaped, however, the tails of the distribution are fatter
or heavier than the normal distribution and therefore, it is a little “shorter” in
the middle as illustrated in Figure ??

Similar to the normal distribution, we can obtain other Student 𝑡distributions
by changing the center of the distribution and changing the scale. A Student t
distribution with a location 𝑚and scale 𝑠with 𝑣degrees of freedom is denoted
as t(𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑠2), with the standard Student t as a special case, t(𝜈, 0, 1).
The density for a 𝑋∼t(𝑣, 𝑚, 𝑠2) random variable is
𝑝(𝑥) =

(4.9)
and by subtracting the location 𝑚and dividing by the scale 𝑠:
𝑋−𝑚
𝑠
≡𝑡∼t(𝑣, 0, 1)
we can obtain the distribution of the standardized Student 𝑡distribution with
degrees of freedom 𝑣, location 0 and scale 1. This latter representation allows
us to use standard statistical functions for posterior inference such as finding
credible intervals.
We are now ready for our main result for the marginal distribution for 𝜇. :::
{.definition #unnamed-chunk-1} If 𝜇and 1/𝜎2 have a NormalGamma(𝑚𝑛, 𝑛𝑛, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛)
posterior distribution, then 𝜇given the data has a distribution, t(𝑣𝑛, 𝑚𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛),
expressed as
𝜇∣data ∼t(𝑣𝑛, 𝑚𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛)

64CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
with degrees of freedom 𝑣𝑛, location parameter, 𝑚𝑛, and squared scale param-
eter, 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛, that is the posterior variance parameter divided by the posterior
sample size.
:::
The parameters 𝑚𝑛and 𝑠2
𝑛play similar roles in determining the center and
spread of the distribution, as in the normal distribution, however, as Student 𝑡
distributions with degrees of freedom less than 3 do not have a mean or variance,
the parameter 𝑚𝑛is called the location or center of the distribution and the
𝑠𝑛/√𝑛is the scale.
Let’s use this result to find credible intervals for 𝜇.
4.1.4
Credible Intervals for 𝜇
To find a credible interval for the mean 𝜇, we will use the marginal posterior
distribution for 𝜇as illustrated in Figure 4.2. Since the Student 𝑡distribution
of 𝜇is unimodal and symmetric, the shortest 95 percent credible interval or the
Highest Posterior Density interval, HPD for short, is the interval given by
the dots at the lower endpoint L and upper endpoint U where the heights of the
density at L and U are equal and all other values for 𝜇have higher posterior
density. The probability that 𝜇is in the interval (L, U) (the shaded area) equals
the desired probability, e.g. 0.95 for a 95% credible interval.
Using the standardized Student 𝑡distribution and some algebra, these values
are
𝐿= 𝑚𝑛+ 𝑡0.025√𝑠2𝑛/𝑛𝑛
𝑈= 𝑚𝑛+ 𝑡0.975√𝑠2𝑛/𝑛𝑛
or the posterior mean (our point estimate) plus quantiles of the standard 𝑡
distribution times the scale. Because of the symmetry in the Student 𝑡distri-
bution, the credible interval for 𝜇is 𝑚𝑛± 𝑡0.975√𝑠2𝑛/𝑛𝑛, which is similar to the
expressions for confidence intervals for the mean.

Using historical prior information about TTHM from the municipality, we
will adopt a normal-gamma prior distribution, NormalGamma(35, 25, 156.25, 24)
with a prior mean of 35 parts per billion, a prior sample size of 25, an estimate
of the variance of 156.25 with degrees of freedom 24. In Section 4.3, we will
describe how we arrived at these values.
Using the summaries of the data,
̄𝑌= 55.5, variance 𝑠2 = 540.7 and sample
size of 𝑛= 28 with the prior hyper-parameters from above, the posterior hyper-
parameters are updated as follows:

in the conjugate NormalGamma(45.8, 53, 459.9, 52) posterior distribution that
now summarizes our uncertainty about 𝜇and 𝜙(𝜎2) after seeing the data.
We can obtain the updated hyper-parameters in R using the following code in R
# prior hyper-parameters
m_0 = 35; n_0 = 25;
s2_0 = 156.25; v_0 = n_0 - 1
# sample summaries

m_n = (n*ybar + n_0*m_0)/n_n
v_n = v_0 + n
s2_n = ((n-1)*s2 + v_0*s2_0 + n_0*n*(m_0 - ybar)^2/n_n)/v_n
Using the following code in R the 95% credible interval for the tap water data
may be obtained using the Student 𝑡quantile function qt.
m_n + qt(c(0.025, 0.975), v_n)*sqrt(s2_n/n_n)

The qt function takes two arguments: the first is the desired quantiles, while
the second is the degrees of freedom. Both arguments may be vectors, in which
case, the result will be a vector.
While we can calculate the interval directly as above, we have provided the
bayes_inference function in the statsr package to calculate the posterior
hyper-parameters, credible intervals and plot the posterior density and the HPD
interval given the raw data:
bayes_inference(tthm, data=tapwater, prior="NG",
mu_0 = m_0, n_0=n_0, s_0 = sqrt(s2_0), v_0 = v_0,

Let’s try to understand the arguments to the function. The first argument of
the function is the variable of interest, tthm, while the second argument is a
dataframe with the variable. The argument prior="NG" indicates that we are
using a normal-gamma prior; later we will present alternative priors. The next
two lines provide our prior hyper-parameters.
The line with stat="mean",
type="ci" indicate that we are interested in inference about the population
mean 𝜇and to calculate a credible interval for 𝜇.
The argument method =
theoretical indicates that we will use the exact quantiles of the Student 𝑡
distribution to obtain our posterior credible intervals. Looking at the output
the credible interval agrees with the interval we calculated from the summaries
using the t quantiles. The other arguments are logical variables to toggle on/off
the various output.
In this case we have suppressed producing the plot of
the posterior distribution using the option show_plot=FALSE, however, set-
ting this to TRUE produces the density and credible interval shown in Figure
@ref{fig:tapwater-post-mu}.
How do we interpret these results? Based on the updated posterior, we find
that there is a 95% chance that the mean TTHM concentration is between 39.9
parts per billion and 51.8 parts per billion, suggesting that for this period that
the municipality is in compliance with the limits.

Section Summary
The normal-gamma conjugate prior for inference about an unknown mean and
variance for samples from a normal distribution allows simple expressions for
updating prior beliefs given the data.
The joint normal-gamma distribution
leads to the Student 𝑡distribution for inference about 𝜇when 𝜎2 is unknown.
The Student 𝑡distribution can be used to provide credible intervals for 𝜇using
R or other software that provides quantiles of a standard 𝑡distribution.
For the energetic learner who is comfortable with calculus, the optional material
at the end of this section provides more details on how the posterior distributions
were obtained and other results in this section.
For those that are ready to move on, we will introduce Monte Carlo sampling in
the next section; Monte Carlo sampling is a simulation method that will allow
us to approximate distributions of transformations of the parameters without
using calculus or change of variables, as well as assist exploratory data analysis
of the prior or posterior distributions.

(Optional) Derivations
From Bayes Theorem we have that the joint posterior distribution is propor-
tional to the likelihood of the parameters times the joint prior distribution

equivalently the sample variance 𝑠2 = ∑
𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑦𝑖−

̄𝑦. Since the likelihood function for (𝜇, 𝜙) is obtained by just substituting
1/𝜙for 𝜎2, the likelihood may be re-expressed as
𝐿(𝜇, 𝜙) ∝𝜙𝑛/2 × exp {−1
2𝜙(𝑛−1)𝑠2} × exp {−1
2𝜙𝑛( ̄𝑦−𝜇)2}.
(4.11)
This likelihood may be obtained also be obtained by using the sampling distri-
bution for the summary statistics, where

distribution and prior for 𝜇together and using the factorization of likelihood
and prior distributions, we may identify that
𝑝(𝜇∣𝜙, data) ∝exp {−1
2𝑛𝜙( ̄𝑦−𝜇)2 −1
2𝑛0𝜙(𝜇−𝑚0)2}
where the above expression includes the sum of two quadratic expressions in the
exponential. This almost looks like a normal. Can these be combined to form
one quadratic expression that looks like a normal density? Yes! This is known
as “completing the square”. Taking a normal distribution for a parameter 𝜇
with mean 𝑚and precision 𝜌, the quadratic term in the exponential may be
expanded as
𝜌× (𝜇−𝑚)2 = 𝜌𝜇2 −2𝜌𝜇𝑚+ 𝜌𝑚2.
From this we can read off that the precision is the term that multiplies the
quadratic in 𝜇and the term that multiplies the linear term in 𝜇is the product
of two times the mean and precision; this means that if we know the precision,
we can identify the mean. The last term is the precision times the mean squared,
which we will need to fill in once we identify the precision and mean.
For our posterior, we need to expand the quadratics and recombine terms to
identify the new precision (the coeﬀicient multiplying the quadratic in 𝜇) and
the new mean (the linear term) and complete the square so that it may be
factored. Any left over terms will be independent of 𝜇but may depend on 𝜙.
For our case, after some algebra to group terms we have
−1
2 (𝑛𝜙( ̄𝑦−𝜇)2 + 𝑛0𝜙(𝜇−𝑚0)2) = −1
2 (𝜙(𝑛+ 𝑛0)𝜇2 −2𝜙𝜇(𝑛̄𝑦+ 𝑛0𝑚0) + 𝜙(𝑛̄𝑦2 + 𝑛0𝑚2
0))
where we can read off that the posterior precision is 𝜙(𝑛+𝑛0) ≡𝜙𝑛𝑛. The linear
term is not yet of the form of the posterior precision times the posterior mean
(times 2), but if we multiply and divide by 𝑛𝑛= 𝑛+ 𝑛0 it is in the appropriate
form
−1
2 (𝜙(𝑛+ 𝑛0)𝜇2 −2𝜙(𝑛+ 𝑛0)𝜇(𝑛̄𝑦+ 𝑛0𝑚0)
𝑛+ 𝑛0
+ 𝜙(𝑛̄𝑦2 + 𝑛0𝑚2
0))
(4.12)
so that we may identify that the posterior mean is 𝑚𝑛= (𝑛̄𝑦+ 𝑛0𝑚0)/(𝑛+ 𝑛0)
which combined with the precision (or inverse variance) is enough to identity
the conditional posterior distribution for 𝜇. We next add the precision times
the square of the posterior mean (the completing the square part), but to keep
equality, we will need to subtract the term as well:
−1
2 (𝑛𝜙( ̄𝑦−𝜇)2 + 𝑛0𝜙(𝜇−𝑚0)2) = −1
2 (𝜙𝑛𝑛𝜇2 −2𝜙𝑛𝑛𝜇𝑚𝑛+ 𝜙𝑛𝑛𝑚2
𝑛−𝜙𝑛𝑛𝑚2
𝑛+ 𝜙(𝑛̄𝑦2 + 𝑛0𝑚2
0))
which after factoring the quadratic leads to
−1
2 (𝑛𝜙( ̄𝑦−𝜇)2 + 𝑛0𝜙(𝜇−𝑚0)2) = −1
2 (𝜙𝑛𝑛(𝜇−𝑚𝑛)2)
(4.13)
−1

4.1.7.1
Derivation of Marginal Distribution for 𝜇
If 𝜇given 𝜎2 (and the data) has a normal distribution with mean 𝑚𝑚and
variance 𝜎2/𝑛𝑛and 1/𝜎2 ≡𝜙(given the data) has a gamma distribution with
shape parameter 𝜈𝑛/2 and rate parameter 𝜈𝑛𝑠2
𝑛/2
𝜇∣𝜎2, data ∼Normal(𝑚𝑚, 𝜎2/𝑛𝑛)
1/𝜎2 ∣data ∼Gamma(𝜈𝑛/2, 𝜈𝑛𝑠2

then
𝜇∣data ∼t(𝜈𝑛, 𝑚𝑚, 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛)
a Student 𝑡distribution with mean 𝑚𝑚and scale 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛with degrees of freedom
𝜈𝑛.
This applies to the prior as well, so that without any data we use the prior
hyper-parameters 𝑚0, 𝑛0, 𝜈0 and 𝑠2
0 in place of the updated values with the
subscript 𝑛.
To simplify notation, we’ll substitute 𝜙= 1/𝜎2. The marginal distribution for
𝜇is obtained by averaging over the values of 𝜎2. Since 𝜎2 takes on continuous

Monte Carlo Inference
In Section 4.1, we showed how to obtain the conditional posterior distribution for
the mean of a normal population given the variance and the marginal posterior
distribution of the precision (inverse variance). The marginal distribution of the
mean, which “averaged over uncertainty” about the unknown variance could be
obtained via integration, leading to the Student t distribution that was used for
inference about the population mean. However, what if we are interested in the

4.2. MONTE CARLO INFERENCE
73
distribution of the standard deviation 𝜎itself, or other transformations of the
parameters? There may not be a closed-form expression for the distributions or
they may be diﬀicult to obtain.
It turns out that Monte Carlo sampling, however, is an easy way to make an
inference about parameters, when we cannot analytically calculate distributions
of parameters, expectations, or probabilities. Monte Carlo methods are compu-
tational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling from distributions
for making inferences. The name refers to the famous Monte Carlo Casino in
Monaco, home to games of chance such as roulette.
4.2.1
Monte Carlo Sampling
Let’s start with a case where we know the posterior distribution. As a quick
recap, recall that the joint posterior distribution for the mean 𝜇and the precision
𝜙= 1/𝜎2 under the conjugate prior for the Gaussian distribution is:
• Conditional posterior distribution for the mean
𝜇∣data, 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝑚𝑛, 𝜎2/𝑛𝑛)
• Marginal posterior distribution for the precision 𝜙or inverse variance:
1/𝜎2 = 𝜙∣data ∼Gamma(𝑣𝑛/2, 𝑠2
𝑛𝑣𝑛/2)
• Marginal posterior distribution for the mean
𝜇∣data ∼t(𝑣𝑛, 𝑚𝑛, 𝑠2
𝑛/𝑛𝑛)
For posterior inference about 𝜙, we can generate 𝑆random samples from the
Gamma posterior distribution:
𝜙(1), 𝜙(2), ⋯, 𝜙(𝑆) iid
∼Gamma(𝑣𝑛/2, 𝑠2
𝑛𝑣𝑛/2)
Recall that the term iid stands for independent and identically distributed. In
other words, the 𝑆draws of 𝜙are independent and identically distributed from
the gamma distribution.
We can use the empirical distribution (histogram) from the 𝑆samples to approx-
imate the actual posterior distribution and the sample mean of the 𝑆random
draws of 𝜙can be used to approximate the posterior mean of 𝜙. Likewise, we
can calculate probabilities, quantiles and other functions using the 𝑆samples
from the posterior distribution. For example, if we want to calculate the pos-
terior expectation of some function of 𝜙, written as 𝑔(𝜙), we can approximate
that by taking the average of the function, and evaluate it at the 𝑆draws of 𝜙,
written as 1
𝑆∑
𝑆
𝑖=1 𝑔(𝜙(𝑖)).
The approximation to the expectation of the function, 𝐸[𝑔(𝜙∣data)] improves

4.2.2
Monte Carlo Inference: Tap Water Example
We will apply this to the tap water example from 4.1. First, reload the data
and calculate the posterior hyper-parameters if needed.
# Prior
m_0 = 35;
n_0 = 25;
s2_0 = 156.25; v_0 = n_0 - 1
# Data
data(tapwater); Y = tapwater$tthm
ybar = mean(Y); s2 = var(Y); n = length(Y)
# Posterior Hyper-paramters
n_n = n_0 + n
m_n = (n*ybar + n_0*m_0)/n_n
v_n = v_0 + n
s2_n = ((n-1)*s2 + v_0*s2_0 + n_0*n*(m_0 - ybar)^2/n_n)/v_n
Before generating our Monte Carlo samples, we will set a random seed using
the set.seed function in R, which takes a small integer argument.
set.seed(42)
This allows the results to be replicated if you re-run the simulation at a later
time.
To generate 1, 000 draws from the gamma posterior distribution using the hyper-
parameters above, we use the rgamma function R
phi = rgamma(1000, shape = v_n/2, rate=s2_n*v_n/2)
The first argument to the rgamma function is the number of samples, the second
is the shape parameter and, by default, the third argument is the rate parameter.
The following code will produce a histogram of the Monte Carlo samples of 𝜙
and overlay the actual Gamma posterior density evaluated at the draws using
the dgamma function in R.
df = data.frame(phi = sort(phi))
df = mutate(df,
density = dgamma(phi,

where the qgamma function in R returns the desired quantiles provided as the first

icant digits, while the quantiles are accurate to two. It increase our accuracy,
we would need to increase 𝑆.

ulation to 10, 000, and see how the approximation changes.
4.2.3
Monte Carlo Inference for Functions of Parameters
Let’s see how to use Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the distribution
of 𝜎. Since 𝜎= 1/√𝜙, we simply apply the transformation to the 1, 000 draws
of 𝜙to obtain a random sample of 𝜎from its posterior distribution. We can
then estimate the posterior mean of 𝜎by calculating the sample mean of the
1,000 draws.

Summary
To recap, we have introduced the powerful method of Monte Carlo simulation
for posterior inference. Monte Carlo methods provide estimates of expectations,
probabilities, and quantiles of distributions from the simulated values. Monte
Carlo simulation also allows us to approximate distributions of functions of the
parameters, or the transformations of the parameters where it may be diﬀicult
to get exact theoretical values.
Next, we will discuss predictive distributions and show how Monte Carlo simu-
lation may be used to help choose prior hyperparameters, using the prior pre-
dictive distribution of data and draw samples from the posterior predictive dis-
tribution for predicting future observations.
4.3
Predictive Distributions
In this section, we will discuss prior and posterior predictive distributions of
the data and show how Monte Carlo sampling from the prior predictive dis-
tribution can help select hyper-parameters, while sampling from the posterior
predictive distribution can be used for predicting future events or model check-
ing.
4.3.1
Prior Predictive Distribution
We can obtain the prior predictive distribution of the data from the joint dis-
tribution of the data and the parameters (𝜇, 𝜎2) or equivalently (𝜇, 𝜙), where
𝜙= 1/𝜎2 is the precision:
Prior:
𝜙∼Gamma (𝑣0
2 , 𝑣0𝑠2
0
2 )
𝜎2 = 1/𝜙
𝜇∣𝜎2 ∼N(𝑚0, 𝜎2/𝑛0)
Sampling model:
𝑌𝑖∣𝜇, 𝜎2 iid
∼Normal(𝜇, 𝜎2)
Prior predictive distribution for 𝑌:
𝑝(𝑌) = ∬𝑝(𝑌∣𝜇, 𝜎2)𝑝(𝜇∣𝜎2)𝑝(𝜎2)𝑑𝜇𝑑𝜎2
𝑌∼𝑡(𝑣0, 𝑚0, 𝑠2
0 + 𝑠2
0/𝑛0)

4.3. PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTIONS
79
By averaging over the possible values of the parameters from the prior distribu-
tion in the joint distribution, technically done by a double integral, we obtain
the Student t as our prior predictive distribution. For those interested, details
of this derivation are provided later in an optional section. This distribution of
the observables depends only on our four hyper-parameters from the normal-
gamma family. We can use Monte Carlo simulation to sample from the prior
predictive distribution to help elicit prior hyper-parameters as we now illustrate
with the tap water example from earlier.
4.3.2
Tap Water Example (continued)
A report from the city water department suggests that levels of TTHM are
expected to be between 10-60 parts per billion (ppb). Let’s see how we can use
this information to create an informative conjugate prior.
Prior Mean First, the normal distribution and Student t distributions are
symmetric around the mean or center parameter, so we will set the prior mean
𝜇to be at the midpoint of the interval 10-60, which would lead to
𝑚0 = (60 + 10)/2 = 35
as our prior hyper-parameter 𝑚0.
Prior Variance Based on the empirical rule for bell-shaped distributions, we
would expect that 95% of observations are within plus or minus two standard
deviations from the mean, ±2𝜎of 𝜇. Using this we expect that the range of the
data should be approximately 4𝜎. Using the values from the report, we can use
this to find our prior estimate of 𝜎, 𝑠0 = (60 −10)/4 = 12.5 or
𝑠2
0 = [(60 −10)/4]2 = 156.25
Prior Sample Size and Degrees of Freedom To complete the specification,
we also need to choose the prior sample size 𝑛0 and degrees of freedom 𝑣0. For
a sample of size 𝑛, the sample variance has 𝑛−1 degrees of freedom. Thinking
about a possible historic set of data of size 𝑛0 that led to the reported interval,
we will adopt that rule to obtain the prior degrees of freedom 𝑣0 = 𝑛0 −1,
leaving only the prior sample size to be determined. We will draw samples from
the prior predictive distribution and modify 𝑛0 so that the simulated data agree
with our prior assumptions.
4.3.3
Sampling from the Prior Predictive in R
The following R code shows a simulation from the predictive distribution with
the prior sample size 𝑛0 = 2. Please be careful to not confuse the prior sample
size, 𝑛0, that represents the precision of our prior information with the number
of Monte Carlo simulations, 𝑆= 10000, that are drawn from the distributions.

80CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
These Monte Carlo samples are used to estimate quantiles of the prior pre-
dictive distribution and a large value of 𝑆reduces error in the Monte Carlo
approximation.

Let’s try to understand the code. After setting the prior hyper-parameters and
random seed, we begin by simulating 𝜙from its gamma prior distribution. We
then transform 𝜙to calculate 𝜎. Using the draws of 𝜎, we feed that into the
rnorm function to simulate 𝑆values of 𝜇for each value of 𝜎. The Monte Carlo
draws of 𝜇, 𝜎are used to generate 𝑆possible values of TTHM denoted by 𝑌.
In the above code we are exploiting that all of the functions for simulating
from distributions can be vectorized, i.e. we can provide all 𝑆draws of 𝜙to
the functions and get a vector result back without having to write a loop. Fi-
nally, we obtain the empirical quantiles from our Monte Carlo sample using the
quantile function to approximate the actual quantiles from the prior predictive
distriubtion.
This forward simulation propagates uncertainty in 𝜇and 𝜎to the prior predic-
tive distribution of the data. Calculating the sample quantiles from the samples
of the prior predictive for 𝑌, we see that the 95% predictive interval for TTHM
includes negative values. Since TTHM cannot be negative, we can adjust 𝑛0
and repeat. Since we need a narrower interval in order to exclude zero, we can
increase 𝑛0 until we achieve the desired quantiles.
After some trial and error, we find that the prior sample size of 25, the empirical
quantiles from the prior predictive distribution are close to the range of 10 to
60 that we were given as prior information.

4.4. REFERENCE PRIORS

4.3.5
Summary
By using Monte Carlo methods, we can obtain prior and posterior predictive
distributions of the data.
• Sampling from the prior predictive distribution can help with the selection
of prior hyper parameters and verify that these choices reflect the prior
information that is available.
• Visualizing prior predictive distributions based on Monte Carlo simula-
tions can help explore implications of our prior assumptions such as the
choice of the hyper parameters or even assume distributions.
• If samples are incompatible with known information, such as support on
positive values, we may need to modify assumptions and look at other
families of prior distributions.
4.4
Reference Priors
In Section 4.3, we demonstrated how to specify an informative prior distribution
for inference about TTHM in tapwater using additional prior information. The
resulting informative Normal-Gamma prior distribution had an effective prior
sample size that was comparable to the observed sample size to be compatible
with the reported prior interval.
There are, however, situations where you may wish to provide an analysis that
does not depend on prior information. There may be cases where prior informa-
tion is simply not available. Or, you may wish to present an objective analysis
where minimal prior information is used to provide a baseline or reference anal-
ysis to contrast with other analyses based on informative prior distributions.
Or perhaps, you want to use the Bayesian paradigm to make probability state-
ments about parameters, but not use any prior information. In this section, we
will examine the qustion of Can you actually perform a Bayesian analy-
sis without using prior information? We will present reference priors for
normal data, which can be viewed as a limiting form of the Normal-Gamma
conjugate prior distribution.
Conjugate priors can be interpreted to be based on a historical or imaginary
prior sample. What happens in the conjugate Normal-Gamma prior if we take
our prior sample size 𝑛0 to go to zero? If we have no data, then we will define the
prior sample variance 𝑠2
0 to go to 0, and based on the relationship between prior
sample sized and prior degrees of freedom, we will let the prior degrees of freedom
go to the prior sample size minus one, or negative one, i.e. 𝑣0 = 𝑛0 −1 →−1.
With this limit, we have the following properties:

• The posterior sample size is the observed sample size.

84CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
• The posterior degrees of freedom go to the sample degrees of freedom.
• The posterior variance parameter goes to the sample variance.
In this limit, the posterior hyperparameters do not depend on the prior hyper-
parameters.

This limiting normal-gamma distribution, NormalGamma(0, 0, 0, −1), is not re-
ally a normal-gamma distribution, as the density does not integrate to 1. The
form of the limit can be viewed as a prior for 𝜇that is proportional to a con-
stant, or uniform/flat on the whole real line. And a prior for the variance is
proportional to 1 over the variance. The joint prior is taken as the product of
the two.
𝑝(𝜇∣𝜎2) ∝1
𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1/𝜎2
𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2) ∝1/𝜎2
This is refered to as a reference prior because the posterior hyperparameters
do not depend on the prior hyperparameters.
In addition, NormalGamma(0, 0, 0, −1) is a special case of a reference prior,
known as the independent Jeffreys prior. While Jeffreys used other arguments
to arrive at the form of the prior, the goal was to have an objective prior
invariant to shifting the data by a constant or multiplying by a constant.
Now, a naive approach to constructing a non-informative distribution might be
to use a uniform distribution to represent lack of knowledge. However, would
you use a uniform distribution for 𝜎2, or a uniform distribution for the preci-
sion 1/𝜎2? Or perhaps a uniform distribution for 𝜎? These would all lead to
different posteriors with little justification for any of them. This ambiguity led
Sir Harold Jeffreys to propose reference distributions for the mean and variance
for situations where prior information was limited. These priors are invariant
to the units of the data.
The unnormalized priors that do not integrate to a constant are called im-
proper distributions. An important consideration in using them is that one

cannot generate samples from the prior or the prior predictive distribution to
data and are referred to as non-generative distributions.
While the reference prior is not a proper prior distribution, and cannot reflect
anyone’s actual prior beliefs, the formal application phase rule can still be used
to show that the posterior distribution is a valid normal gamma distri-
bution, leading to a formal phase posterior distribution. That depends only on
summary statistics of the data.
The posterior distribution NormalGamma( ̄𝑌, 𝑛, 𝑠2, 𝑛−1) breaks down to
𝜇∣𝜎2, data ∼Normal( ̄𝑌, 𝜎2/𝑛)
1/𝜎2 ∣data ∼Gamma((𝑛−1)/2, 𝑠2(𝑛−1)/2).

• However, only the Bayesian approach justifies the probability statements
about 𝜇being in the interval after seeing the data.
𝑃( ̄𝑌−𝑡1−𝛼/2 × 𝑠/√𝑛< 𝜇<
̄𝑌+ 𝑡1−𝛼/2 × 𝑠/√𝑛) = 1 −𝛼
We can use either analytic expressions based on the t-distribution, or Monte
Carlo samples from the posterior predictive distribution, to make predictions
about a new sample.
Here is some code to generate the Monte Carlo samples from the tap water
example:
phi = rgamma(10000, (n-1)/2, s2*(n-1)/2)
sigma = 1/sqrt(phi)
post_mu = rnorm(10000, mean=ybar, sd=sigma/(sqrt(n)))
pred_y =
rnorm(10000,post_mu, sigma)
quantile(pred_y, c(.025, .975))

Using the Monte Carlo samples, Figure 4.7 shows the posterior distribution
based on the informative Normal-Gamma prior and the reference prior. Both
the posterior distribution for 𝜇and the posterior predictive distribution for a
new sample are shifted to the right, and are centered at the sample mean. The
posterior for 𝜇under the reference prior is less concentrated around its mean
than the posterior under the informative prior, which leads to an increased
posterior sample size and hence increased precision.

In constructing the informative prior from the reported interval, there are two
critical assumptions. First, the prior data are exchangeable with the observed

4.5. MIXTURES OF CONJUGATE PRIORS
87
data. Second, the conjugate normal gamma distribution is suitable for repre-
senting the prior information. These assumptions may or may not be verifiable,
but they should be considered carefully when using informative conjugate priors.
In the case of the tap water example, there are several concerns: One, it is
unclear that the prior data are exchangeable with the observed data. For ex-
ample, water treatment conditions may have changed. Two, the prior sample
size was not based on a real prior sample, but instead selected so that the prior
predictive intervals under the normal gamma model agreed with the prior data.
As we do not have access to the prior data, we cannot check assumptions about
normality that would help justify the prior. Other skewed distributions may be
consistent with the prior interval, but lead to different conclusions.
To recap, we have introduced a reference prior for inference for normal data
with an unknown mean and variance. Reference priors are often part of a prior
sensitivity study and are used when objectivity is of utmost importance.
If conclusions are fundamentally different with an informative prior and a ref-
erence prior, one may wish to carefully examine assumputions that led to the
informative prior.
• Is the prior information based on a prior sample that is exchangable with
the observed data?
• Is the normal-gamma assumption appropriate?
Informative priors can provide more accurate inference when data are limited,
and the transparency of explicitly laying out prior assumptions is an important
aspect of reproducible research. However, one needs to be careful that certain
prior assumptions may lead to un-intended consequences.
Next, we will investigate a prior distribution that is a mixture of conjugate pri-
ors, so the new prior distribution provides robustness to prior mis-specification
in the prior sample size.
While we will no longer have nice analytical expressions for the posterior, we can
simulate from the posterior distribution using a Monte Carlo algorithm called
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
4.5
Mixtures of Conjugate Priors
In this section, we will describe priors that are constructed as a mixture of
conjugate priors – in particular, the Cauchy distribution. As these are no longer
conjugate priors, nice analytic expressions for the posterior distribution are not
available. However, we can use a Monte Carlo algorithm called Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) for posterior inference.
In many situations, we may have reasonable prior information about the mean
𝜇, but we are less confident in how many observations our prior beliefs are

88CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE AND DECISION-MAKING WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
equivalent to. We can address this uncertainty in the prior sample size, through
an additional prior distribution on a 𝑛0 via a hierarchical prior.
The hierarchical prior for the normal gamma distribution is written as
𝜇∣𝜎2, 𝑛0 ∼Normal(𝑚0, 𝜎2/𝑛0)
𝑛0 ∣𝜎2 ∼Gamma(1/2, 𝑟2/2)
If 𝑟= 1, then this corresponds to a prior expected sample size of one because
the expectation of Gamma(1/2, 1/2) is one.
The marginal prior distribution from 𝜇can be attained via integration, and we
get
𝜇∣𝜎2 ∼C(𝑚0, 𝜎2𝑟2)
This is a Cauchy distribution centered at the prior mean 𝑚0, with the scale
parameter 𝜎2𝑟2. The probability density function (pdf) is:
𝑝(𝜇∣𝜎) =
1
𝜋𝜎𝑟(1 + (𝜇−𝑚0)2
𝜎2𝑟2
)
−1
The Cauchy distribution does not have a mean or standard deviation, but the
center (location) and the scale play a similar role to the mean and standard
deviation of the normal distribution. The Cauchy distribution is a special case
of a student 𝑡distribution with one degree of freedom.
As Figure 4.8 shows, the standard Cauchy distribution with 𝑟= 1 and the
standard normal distribution Normal(0, 1) are centered at the same location.
But the Cauchy distribution has heavier tails – more probability on extreme
values than the normal distribution with the same scale parameter 𝜎. Cauchy
priors were recommended by Sir Harold Jeffreys as a default objective prior for
testing.
4.6
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
The Cauchy prior described in Section 4.5 is not a conjugate prior, and therefore,
the posterior distribution from (𝜇∣𝜎2), is not a Cauchy or any well-known
distribution. Fortunately, the conditional distribution of (𝜇, 𝜎2 ∣𝑛0, data), is
normal-gamma and easy to simulate from, as we learned in the previous sections.
The conditional distribution of (𝑛0 ∣𝜇, 𝜎2, data) is a gamma distribution, also
easy to simulate from the given 𝜇, 𝜎2.
It turns out that if we alternate generating Monte Carlo samples from these
conditional distributions, the sequence of samples converges to samples from
the joint distribution of (𝜇, 𝜎2, 𝑛0), as the number of simulated values increases.

The Monte Carlo algorithm we have just described is a special case of Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), known as the Gibbs sampler.
Let’s look at the pseudo code for the algorithm.
# initialize MCMC
sigma2[1] = 1; n_0[1]=1; mu[1]=m_0
#draw from full conditional distributions
for (i in 2:S) {
mu[i]
= p_mu(sigma2[i-1], n_0[i-1],
m_0, r, data)
sigma2[i] = p_sigma2(mu[i], n_0[i-1],
m_0, r, data)
n_0[i]
= p_n_0(mu[i], sigma2[i],
m_0, r, data)
}
We start with the initial values of each of the parameters for 𝑖= 1. In theory,
these can be completely arbitrary, as long as they are allowed values for the
parameters.
For each iteration 𝑖, the algorithm will cycle through generating each parameter,
given the current value of the other parameters. The functions p_mu, p_sigma2,
and p_n_0 return a simulated value from the respective distribution conditional
on the inputs.
Whenever we update a parameter, we use the new value in the subsequent
steps as the 𝑛draws for 𝜎, 𝑛0. We will repeat this until we reach iteration 𝑆,
leading to a dependent sequence of s draws from the joint posterior distribution.
Incorporating the tap water example in Section 4.1, we will use MCMC to
generate samples under the Cauchy prior. We set 35 as the location parameter
and 𝑟= 1. To complete our prior specification, we use the Jeffrey’s reference
prior on 𝜎2. This combination is referred to as the Jeffrey’s Zellner-Siow Cauchy
prior or “JZS” in the BayesFactor branch of the R statsr package.

Density
Using the bayes_inference function from the statsr package, we can obtain
summary statistics and a plot from the MCMC output – not only 𝜇, but also
inference about 𝜎2 and the prior sample size.
The posterior mean under the JZS model is much closer to the sample mean
than what the normal gamma prior used previously.
Under the informative
normal gamma prior, the sample made a 55.5, about eight standard deviations
above the mean – a surprising value under the normal prior. Under the Cauchy
prior, the informative prior location has much less influence.
This is the robustness property of the Cauchy prior, leading the posterior
to put more weight on the sample mean than the prior mean, especially when
the prior location is not close to the sample mean. We can see that the central
50% interval for 𝑛0 is well below the value 25 used in the normal prior, which
placed almost equal weight on the prior in sample mean.
Using the MCMC draws of 𝜇, 𝜎, we can obtain Monte Carlo samples from the
predictive distribution of 𝑦, by plugging 𝜇and 𝜎into the corresponding func-
tions. Figure 4.9 compares the posterior densities estimated from the simulative
values of 𝜇and the predicted draws of TTHM under the Jeffrey Zellner-Siow
prior, and the informative normal prior from 𝜇with 𝑛0 = 25 and the reference
prior on 𝜎2.

To recap, we have shown how to create more flexible prior distributions, such
as the Cauchy distribution using mixtures of conjugate priors. As the posterior
distributions are not available in closed form, we demonstrated how MCMC
can be used for inference using the hierarchical prior distribution.
Starting
in the late 1980’s, MCMC algorithms have led to an exponential rise in the
use of Bayes in methods, because complex models built through hierarchical
distributions suddenly were tractable. The Cauchy prior is well-known for being
robust prior mis-specifications. For example, having a prior mean that is far
from the observed mean. This provides an alternative to the reference prior as
a default or objective distribution that is proper.
In the next sections, we will return to Bayes factors and hypothesis testing
where the Cauchy prior plays an important role.

Chapter 5
Hypothesis Testing with
Normal Populations
In Section 3.5, we described how the Bayes factors can be used for hypothesis
testing.
Now we will use the Bayes factors to compare normal means, i.e.,
test whether the mean of a population is zero or compare the means of two
groups of normally-distributed populations. We divide this mission into three
cases: known variance for a single population, unknown variance for a single
population using paired data, and unknown variance using two independent
groups.
Also note that some of the examples in this section use an updated version of
the bayes_inference function. If your local output is different from what is
seen in this chapter, or the provided code fails to run for you please make sure
that you have the most recent version of the package.
5.1
Bayes Factors for Testing a Normal Mean:
variance known
Now we show how to obtain Bayes factors for testing hypothesis about a normal
mean, where the variance is known. To start, let’s consider a random sample
of observations from a normal population with mean 𝜇and pre-specified variance
𝜎2. We consider testing whether the population mean 𝜇is equal to 𝑚0 or not.
Therefore, we can formulate the data and hypotheses as below:
Data

Hypotheses
93

94CHAPTER 5. HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH NORMAL POPULATIONS
• 𝐻1 ∶𝜇= 𝑚0
• 𝐻2 ∶𝜇≠𝑚0
Priors
We also need to specify priors for 𝜇under both hypotheses.
Under 𝐻1, we
assume that 𝜇is exactly 𝑚0, so this occurs with probability 1 under 𝐻1. Now
under 𝐻2, 𝜇is unspecified, so we describe our prior uncertainty with the con-
jugate normal distribution centered at 𝑚0 and with a variance 𝜎2/n0. This is
centered at the hypothesized value 𝑚0, and it seems that the mean is equally
likely to be larger or smaller than 𝑚0, so a dividing factor 𝑛0 is given to the
variance. The hyper parameter 𝑛0 controls the precision of the prior as before.
In mathematical terms, the priors are:
• 𝐻1 ∶𝜇= 𝑚0 with probability 1
• 𝐻2 ∶𝜇∼Normal(𝑚0, 𝜎2/n0)
Bayes Factor
Now the Bayes factor for comparing 𝐻1 to 𝐻2 is the ratio of the distribution,
the data under the assumption that 𝜇= 𝑚0 to the distribution of the data
under 𝐻2.
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] =
𝑝(data ∣𝜇= 𝑚0, 𝜎2)

The term in the denominator requires integration to account for the uncertainty
in 𝜇under 𝐻2. And it can be shown that the Bayes factor is a function of the
observed sampled size, the prior sample size 𝑛0 and a 𝑍score.
Let’s explore how the hyperparameters in 𝑛0 influences the Bayes factor in
Equation (5.1). For illustration we will use the sample size of 100. Recall that
for estimation, we interpreted 𝑛0 as a prior sample size and considered the
limiting case where 𝑛0 goes to zero as a non-informative or reference prior.

𝑍score or how many standard errors
̄𝑦is from the hypothesized mean. As
expected, larger values of the 𝑍score favor 𝐻2.

96CHAPTER 5. HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH NORMAL POPULATIONS
But as 𝑛0 becomes smaller and approaches 0, the first term in the Bayes factor
goes to infinity, while the exponential term involving the data goes to a constant
and is ignored. In the limit as 𝑛0 →0 under this noninformative prior, the Bayes
factor paradoxically ends up favoring 𝐻1 regardless of the value of
̄𝑦.
The takeaway from this is that we cannot use improper priors with 𝑛0 = 0, if
we are going to test our hypothesis that 𝜇= 𝑛0. Similarly, vague priors that use
a small value of 𝑛0 are not recommended due to the sensitivity of the results to
the choice of an arbitrarily small value of 𝑛0.
This problem arises with vague priors – the Bayes factor favors the null model
𝐻1 even when the data are far away from the value under the null – are known
as the Bartlett’s paradox or the Jeffrey’s-Lindleys paradox.
Now, one way to understand the effect of prior is through the standard effect
size
𝛿= 𝜇−𝑚0
𝜎
.
The prior of the standard effect size is
𝛿∣𝐻2 ∼Normal(0, 1
n0
)
This allows us to think about a standardized effect independent of the units of
the problem. One default choice is using the unit information prior, where the
prior sample size 𝑛0 is 1, leading to a standard normal for the standardized effect
size. This is depicted with the blue normal density in Figure 5.2. This suggested
that we expect that the mean will be within ±1.96 standard deviations of the
hypothesized mean with probability 0.95. (Note that we can say this only
under a Bayesian setting.)
In many fields we expect that the effect will be small relative to 𝜎. If we do not
expect to see large effects, then we may want to use a more informative prior
on the effect size as the density in orange with 𝑛0 = 4. So they expected the
mean to be within ±1/√𝑛0 or five standard deviations of the prior mean.
Example 5.1. To illustrate, we give an example from parapsychological re-
search. The case involved the test of the subject’s claim to affect a series of
randomly generated 0’s and 1’s by means of extra sensory perception (ESP).
The random sequence of 0’s and 1’s are generated by a machine with probabil-
ity of generating 1 being 0.5. The subject claims that his ESP would make the
sample mean differ significantly from 0.5.
Therefore, we are testing 𝐻1 ∶𝜇= 0.5 versus 𝐻2 ∶𝜇≠0.5. Let’s use a prior
that suggests we do not expect a large effect which leads the following solution

Figure 5.2: Prior on standard effect size

is between (−0.03/𝜎, 0.03/𝜎), with 𝑛0 = (1.96𝜎/0.03)2 = 32.72.
Figure 5.3 shows our informative prior in blue, while the unit information prior
is in orange. On this scale, the unit information prior needs to be almost uniform
for the range that we are interested.
A very large data set with over 104 million trials was collected to test this
hypothesis, so we use a normal distribution to approximate the distribution the
sample mean.
• Sample size: 𝑛= 1.0449 × 108
• Sample mean:
̄𝑦= 0.500177, standard deviation 𝜎= 0.5
• 𝑍-score: 3.61
Now using our prior in the data, the Bayes factor for 𝐻1 to 𝐻2 was 0.46, implying
evidence against the hypothesis 𝐻1 that 𝜇= 0.5.
• Informative BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 0.46
• BF[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1] = 1/BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 2.19
Now, this can be inverted to provide the evidence in favor of 𝐻2. The evidence
suggests that the hypothesis that the machine operates with a probability that
is not 0.5, is 2.19 times more likely than the hypothesis the probability is 0.5.
Based on the interpretation of Bayes factors from Table 3.5, this is in the range

To recap, we present expressions for calculating Bayes factors for a normal
model with a specified variance. We show that the improper reference priors
for 𝜇when 𝑛0 = 0, or vague priors where 𝑛0 is arbitrarily small, lead to Bayes
factors that favor the null hypothesis regardless of the data, and thus should
not be used for hypothesis testing.
Bayes factors with normal priors can be sensitive to the choice of the 𝑛0. While
the default value of 𝑛0 = 1 is reasonable in many cases, this may be too non-
informative if one expects more effects. Wherever possible, think about how
large an effect you expect and use that information to help select the 𝑛0.
All the ESP examples suggest weak evidence and favored the machine generating
random 0’s and 1’s with a probability that is different from 0.5. Note that ESP
is not the only explanation – a deviation from 0.5 can also occur if the random
number generator is biased.
Bias in the stream of random numbers in our
pseudorandom numbers has huge implications for numerous fields that depend
on simulation. If the context had been about detecting a small bias in random
numbers what prior would you use and how would it change the outcome?
You can experiment it in R or other software packages that generate random
Bernoulli trials.
Next, we will look at Bayes factors in normal models with unknown variances

Comparing Two Paired Means using Bayes
Factors
We previously learned that we can use a paired t-test to compare means from
two paired samples. In this section, we will show how Bayes factors can be
expressed as a function of the t-statistic for comparing the means and provide
posterior probabilities of the hypothesis that whether the means are equal or
different.
Example 5.2. Trace metals in drinking water affect the flavor, and unusually
high concentrations can pose a health hazard. Ten pairs of data were taken
measuring the zinc concentration in bottom and surface water at ten randomly
sampled locations, as listed in Table 5.1.
Water samples collected at the the same location, on the surface and the bot-
tom, cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. However, it may be
reasonable to assume that the differences in the concentration at the bottom
and the surface in randomly sampled locations are independent of each other.
To start modeling, we will treat the ten differences as a random sample from a
normal population where the parameter of interest is the difference between the
average zinc concentration at the bottom and the average zinc concentration at
the surface, or the main difference, 𝜇.
In mathematical terms, we have
• Random sample of 𝑛= 10 differences 𝑌1, … , 𝑌𝑛

100CHAPTER 5. HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH NORMAL POPULATIONS
• Normal population with mean 𝜇≡𝜇𝐵−𝜇𝑆
In this case, we have no information about the variability in the data, and we
will treat the variance, 𝜎2, as unknown.
The hypothesis of the main concentration at the surface and bottom are the
same is equivalent to saying 𝜇= 0. The second hypothesis is that the difference
between the mean bottom and surface concentrations, or equivalently that the
mean difference 𝜇≠0.
In other words, we are going to compare the following hypotheses:
• 𝐻1 ∶𝜇𝐵= 𝜇𝑆⇔𝜇= 0
• 𝐻2 ∶𝜇𝐵≠𝜇𝑆⇔𝜇≠0
The Bayes factor is the ratio between the distributions of the data under each
hypothesis, which does not depend on any unknown parameters.
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑝(data ∣𝐻1)
𝑝(data ∣𝐻2)
To obtain the Bayes factor, we need to use integration over the prior distribu-
tions under each hypothesis to obtain those distributions of the data.
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = ∬𝑝(data ∣𝜇, 𝜎2)𝑝(𝜇∣𝜎2)𝑝(𝜎2 ∣𝐻2) 𝑑𝜇𝑑𝜎2
This requires specifying the following priors:
• 𝜇∣𝜎2, 𝐻2 ∼Normal(0, 𝜎2/𝑛0)
• 𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1/𝜎2 for both 𝐻1 and 𝐻2
𝜇is exactly zero under the hypothesis 𝐻1. For 𝜇in 𝐻2, we start with the same
conjugate normal prior as we used in Section 5.1 – testing the normal mean with
known variance. Since we assume that 𝜎2 is known, we model 𝜇∣𝜎2 instead of
𝜇itself.
The 𝜎2 appears in both the numerator and denominator of the Bayes factor.
For default or reference case, we use the Jeffreys prior (a.k.a. reference prior)
on 𝜎2. As long as we have more than two observations, this (improper) prior
will lead to a proper posterior.
After integration and rearranging, one can derive a simple expression for the
Bayes factor:
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = (𝑛+ 𝑛0
𝑛0
)
1/2
(
𝑡2
𝑛0
𝑛+𝑛0 + 𝜈

This is a function of the t-statistic

𝑠/√𝑛,
where 𝑠is the sample standard deviation and the degrees of freedom 𝜈= 𝑛−1
(sample size minus one).
As we saw in the case of Bayes factors with known variance, we cannot use the
improper prior on 𝜇because when 𝑛0 →0, then BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] →∞favoring 𝐻1
regardless of the magnitude of the t-statistic. Arbitrary, vague small choices for
𝑛0 also lead to arbitrary large Bayes factors in favor of 𝐻1. Another example
of the Barlett’s or Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.
Sir Herald Jeffrey discovered another paradox testing using the conjugant nor-
mal prior, known as the information paradox. His thought experiment as-
sumed that our sample size 𝑛and the prior sample size 𝑛0. He then considered
what would happen to the Bayes factor as the sample mean moved further and
further away from the hypothesized mean, measured in terms standard errors
with the t-statistic, i.e., |𝑡| →∞. As the t-statistic or information about the
mean moved further and further from zero, the Bayes factor goes to a constant
depending on 𝑛, 𝑛0 rather than providing overwhelming support for 𝐻2.
The bounded Bayes factor is
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] →(
𝑛0
𝑛0 + 𝑛)
𝑛−1
2
Jeffrey wanted a prior with BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] →0 (or equivalently, BF[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1] →
∞), as the information from the t-statistic grows, indicating the sample mean
is as far as from the hypothesized mean and should favor 𝐻2.
To resolve the paradox when the information the t-statistic favors 𝐻2 but the
Bayes factor does not, Jeffreys showed that no normal prior could resolve
the paradox.
But a Cauchy prior on 𝜇, would resolve it. In this way, BF[𝐻2 ∶𝐻1] goes to
infinity as the sample mean becomes further away from the hypothesized mean.
Recall that the Cauchy prior is written as C(0, 𝑟2𝜎2). While Jeffreys used a
default of 𝑟= 1, smaller values of 𝑟can be used if smaller effects are expected.
The combination of the Jeffrey’s prior on 𝜎2 and this Cauchy prior on 𝜇under
𝐻2 is sometimes referred to as the Jeffrey-Zellener-Siow prior.
However, there is no closed form expressions for the Bayes factor under the
Cauchy distribution. To obtain the Bayes factor, we must use the numerical
integration or simulation methods.
We will use the bayes_inference function from the statsr package to test
whether the mean difference is zero in Example 5.2 (zinc), using the JZS
(Jeffreys-Zellener-Siow) prior.

With equal prior probabilities on the two hypothesis, the Bayes factor is the
posterior odds. From the output, we see this indicates that the hypothesis 𝐻2,
the mean difference is different from 0, is almost 51 times more likely than the
hypothesis 𝐻1 that the average concentration is the same at the surface and the
bottom.
To sum up, we have used the Cauchy prior as a default prior testing hypothesis
about a normal mean when variances are unknown. This does require numerical
integration, but it is available in the bayes_inference function from the statsr
package. If you expect that the effect sizes will be small, smaller values of 𝑟are
recommended.
It is often important to quantify the magnitude of the difference in addition to
testing. The Cauchy Prior provides a default prior for both testing and inference;
it avoids problems that arise with choosing a value of 𝑛0 (prior sample size) in
both cases. In the next section, we will illustrate using the Cauchy prior for
comparing two means from independent normal samples.
5.3
Comparing Independent Means: Hypothesis
Testing
In the previous section, we described Bayes factors for testing whether the mean
difference of paired samples was zero. In this section, we will consider a slightly
different problem – we have two independent samples, and we would like to
test the hypothesis that the means are different or equal.
Example 5.3. We illustrate the testing of independent groups with data from
a 2004 survey of birth records from North Carolina, which are available in the

104CHAPTER 5. HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH NORMAL POPULATIONS
statsr package.
The variable of interest is gained – the weight gain of mothers during pregnancy.
We have two groups defined by the categorical variable, mature, with levels,
younger mom and older mom.
Question of interest: Do the data provide convincing evidence of a difference
between the average weight gain of older moms and the average weight gain of
younger moms?
We will view the data as a random sample from two populations, older and
younger moms. The two groups are modeled as:
𝑌𝑂,𝑖
iid
∼N(𝜇+ 𝛼/2, 𝜎2)
𝑌𝑌,𝑖
iid
∼N(𝜇−𝛼/2, 𝜎2)
(5.2)
The model for weight gain for older moms using the subscript 𝑂, and it assumes
that the observations are independent and identically distributed, with a mean
𝜇+ 𝛼/2 and variance 𝜎2.
For the younger women, the observations with the subscript 𝑌are independent
and identically distributed with a mean 𝜇−𝛼/2 and variance 𝜎2.
Using this representation of the means in the two groups, the difference in means
simplifies to 𝛼– the parameter of interest.
(𝜇+ 𝛼/2) −(𝜇−𝛼/2) = 𝛼
You may ask, “Why don’t we set the average weight gain of older women to
𝜇+ 𝛼, and the average weight gain of younger women to 𝜇?” We need the
parameter 𝛼to be present in both 𝑌𝑂,𝑖(the group of older women) and 𝑌𝑌,𝑖
(the group of younger women).
We have the following competing hypotheses:
• 𝐻1 ∶𝛼= 0 ⇔The means are not different.
• 𝐻2 ∶𝛼≠0 ⇔The means are different.
In this representation, 𝜇represents the overall weight gain for all women. (Does
the model in Equation (5.2) make more sense now?) To test the hypothesis, we
need to specify prior distributions for 𝛼under 𝐻2 (c.f. 𝛼= 0 under 𝐻1) and
priors for 𝜇, 𝜎2 under both hypotheses.
Recall that the Bayes factor is the ratio of the distribution of the data under
the two hypotheses.

5.3. COMPARING INDEPENDENT MEANS: HYPOTHESIS TESTING 105
BF[𝐻1 ∶𝐻2] = 𝑝(data ∣𝐻1)
𝑝(data ∣𝐻2)
=
∬𝑝(data ∣𝛼= 0, 𝜇, 𝜎2)𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2 ∣𝐻1) 𝑑𝜇𝑑𝜎2
∫∬𝑝(data ∣𝛼, 𝜇, 𝜎2)𝑝(𝛼∣𝜎2)𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2 ∣𝐻2) 𝑑𝜇𝑑𝜎2 𝑑𝛼
As before, we need to average over uncertainty and the parameters to obtain
the unconditional distribution of the data. Now, as in the test about a single
mean, we cannot use improper or non-informative priors for 𝛼for testing.
Under 𝐻2, we use the Cauchy prior for 𝛼, or equivalently, the Cauchy prior on
the standardized effect 𝛿with the scale of 𝑟:
𝛿= 𝛼/𝜎2 ∼C(0, 𝑟2)
Now, under both 𝐻1 and 𝐻2, we use the Jeffrey’s reference prior on 𝜇and 𝜎2:
𝑝(𝜇, 𝜎2) ∝1/𝜎2
While this is an improper prior on 𝜇, this does not suffer from the Bartlett’s-
Lindley’s-Jeffreys’ paradox as 𝜇is a common parameter in the model in 𝐻1 and
𝐻2. This is another example of the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow prior.
As in the single mean case, we will need numerical algorithms to obtain the
Bayes factor.
Now the following output illustrates testing of Bayes factors,
using the Bayes inference function from the statsr package.

We see that the Bayes factor for 𝐻1 to 𝐻2 is about 5.7, with positive support
for 𝐻1 that there is no difference in average weight gain between younger and
older women. Using equal prior probabilities, the probability that there is a
difference in average weight gain between the two groups is about 0.15 given
the data. Based on the interpretation of Bayes factors from Table 3.5, this is in
the range of “positive” (between 3 and 20).
To recap, we have illustrated testing hypotheses about population means with
two independent samples, using a Cauchy prior on the difference in the means.
One assumption that we have made is that the variances are equal in both
groups. The case where the variances are unequal is referred to as the Behren-
Fisher problem, and this is beyond the scope for this course. In the next section,
we will look at another example to put everything together with testing and
discuss summarizing results.
5.4
Inference after Testing
In this section, we will work through another example for comparing two means
using both hypothesis tests and interval estimates, with an informative prior.
We will also illustrate how to adjust the credible interval after testing.

5.4. INFERENCE AFTER TESTING
107
Example 5.4. We will use the North Carolina survey data to examine the
relationship between infant birth weight and whether the mother smoked during
pregnancy. The response variable, weight, is the birth weight of the baby in
pounds. The categorical variable habit provides the status of the mother as a
smoker or non-smoker.
We would like to answer two questions:
1. Is there a difference in average birth weight between the two groups?
2. If there is a difference, how large is the effect?
As before, we need to specify models for the data and priors. We treat the data
as a random sample for the two populations, smokers and non-smokers.
The birth weights of babies born to non-smokers, designated by a subgroup
𝑁, are assumed to be independent and identically distributed from a normal
distribution with mean 𝜇+ 𝛼/2, as in Section 5.3.
𝑌𝑁,𝑖
iid
∼Normal(𝜇+ 𝛼/2, 𝜎2)
While the birth weights of the babies born to smokers, designated by the sub-
group 𝑆, are also assumed to have a normal distribution, but with mean 𝜇−𝛼/2.
𝑌𝑆,𝑖
iid
∼Normal(𝜇−𝛼/2, 𝜎2)
The difference in the average birth weights is the parameter 𝛼, because
(𝜇+ 𝛼/2) −(𝜇−𝛼/2) = 𝛼
.
The hypotheses that we will test are 𝐻1 ∶𝛼= 0 versus 𝐻2 ∶𝛼≠0.
We will still use the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior. However, since we may
expect the standardized effect size to not be as strong, we will use a scale of
𝑟= 0.5 rather than 1.
Therefore, under 𝐻2, we have
𝛿= 𝛼/𝜎∼C(0, 𝑟2), with 𝑟= 0.5.
Under both 𝐻1 and 𝐻2, we will use the reference priors on 𝜇and 𝜎2:
𝑝(𝜇) ∝1
𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1/𝜎2

The input to the base inference function is similar, but now we will specify that
𝑟= 0.5.

We see that the Bayes factor is 1.44, which weakly favors there being a difference
in average birth weights for babies whose mothers are smokers versus mothers
who did not smoke. Converting this to a probability, we find that there is about
a 60% chance of the average birth weights are different.
While looking at evidence of there being a difference is useful, Bayes factors and
posterior probabilities do not convey any information about the magnitude of
the effect. Reporting a credible interval or the complete posterior distribution
is more relevant for quantifying the magnitude of the effect.
Using the bayes_inference function, we can generate samples from the poste-
rior distribution under 𝐻2 using the type='ci' option.

The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the difference in the means provide a 95%
credible interval of 0.023 to 0.57 pounds for the difference in average birth
weight. The MCMC output shows not only summaries about the difference in
the mean 𝛼, but the other parameters in the model.
In particular, the Cauchy prior arises by placing a gamma prior on 𝑛0 and the
conjugate normal prior. This provides quantiles about 𝑛0 after updating with
the current data.
The row labeled effect size is the standardized effect size 𝛿, indicating that the
effects are indeed small relative to the noise in the data.

Figure 5.4 shows the posterior density for the difference in means, with the 95%
credible interval indicated by the shaded area. Under 𝐻2, there is a 95% chance
that the average birth weight of babies born to non-smokers is 0.023 to 0.57
pounds higher than that of babies born to smokers.
The previous statement assumes that 𝐻2 is true and is a conditional probability
statement. In mathematical terms, the statement is equivalent to

𝑃(0.023 < 𝛼< 0.57 ∣data, 𝐻2) = 0.95
However, we still have quite a bit of uncertainty based on the current data,
because given the data, the probability of 𝐻2 being true is 0.59.
𝑃(𝐻2 ∣data) = 0.59
Using the law of total probability, we can compute the probability that 𝜇is
between 0.023 and 0.57 as below:
𝑃(0.023 < 𝛼< 0.57 ∣data)
=𝑃(0.023 < 𝛼< 0.57 ∣data, 𝐻1)𝑃(𝐻1 ∣data) + 𝑃(0.023 < 𝛼< 0.57 ∣data, 𝐻2)𝑃(𝐻2 ∣data)
=𝐼(0 in CI )𝑃(𝐻1 ∣data) + 0.95 × 𝑃(𝐻2 ∣data)
=0 × 0.41 + 0.95 × 0.59 = 0.5605
Finally, we get that the probability that 𝛼is in the interval, given the data,
averaging over both hypotheses, is roughly 0.56. The unconditional statement
is the average birth weight of babies born to nonsmokers is 0.023 to 0.57 pounds
higher than that of babies born to smokers with probability 0.56. This adjust-
ment addresses the posterior uncertainty and how likely 𝐻2 is.
To recap, we have illustrated testing, followed by reporting credible intervals,
and using a Cauchy prior distribution that assumed smaller standardized effects.
After testing, it is common to report credible intervals conditional on 𝐻2. We
also have shown how to adjust the probability of the interval to reflect our
posterior uncertainty about 𝐻2. In the next chapter, we will turn to regression
models to incorporate continuous explanatory variables.

Chapter 6
Introduction to Bayesian
Regression
In the previous chapter, we introduced Bayesian decision making using posterior
probabilities and a variety of loss functions. We discussed how to minimize the
expected loss for hypothesis testing. Moreover, we instroduced the concept of
Bayes factors and gave some examples on how Bayes factors can be used in
Bayesian hypothesis testing for comparison of two means. We also discussed
how to choose appropriate and robust priors. When there is no conjugacy, we
applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the posterior
distributions of parameters of interest.
In this chapter, we will apply Bayesian inference methods to linear regression.
We will first apply Bayesian statistics to simple linear regression models, then
generalize the results to multiple linear regression models. We will see when us-
ing the reference prior, the posterior means, posterior standard deviations, and
credible intervals of the coeﬀicients coincide with the counterparts in the fre-
quentist ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression models. However, using
the Bayesian framework, we can now interpret credible intervals as the proba-
bilities of the coeﬀicients lying in such intervals.
6.1
Bayesian Simple Linear Regression
In this section, we will turn to Bayesian inference in simple linear regressions.
We will use the reference prior distribution on coeﬀicients, which will provide
a connection between the frequentist solutions and Bayesian answers.
This
provides a baseline analysis for comparisons with more informative prior dis-
tributions. To illustrate the ideas, we will use an example of predicting body
fat.

Frequentist Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Simple
Linear Regression
Obtaining accurate measurements of body fat is expensive and not easy to be
done. Instead, predictive models that predict the percentage of body fat which
use readily available measurements such as abdominal circumference are easy
to use and inexpensive. We will apply a simple linear regression to predict body
fat using abdominal circumference as an example to illustrate the Bayesian
approach of linear regression. The data set bodyfat can be found from the
library BAS.
To start, we load the BAS library (which can be downloaded from CRAN) to

6.1. BAYESIAN SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

This data frame includes 252 observations of men’s body fat and other measure-
ments, such as waist circumference (Abdomen). We will construct a Bayesian
model of simple linear regression, which uses Abdomen to predict the response
variable Bodyfat. Let 𝑦𝑖, 𝑖= 1, ⋯, 252 denote the measurements of the re-
sponse variable Bodyfat, and let 𝑥𝑖be the waist circumference measurements
Abdomen. We regress Bodyfat on the predictor Abdomen. This regression model
can be formulated as
𝑦𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖,
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 252.
Here, we assume error 𝜖𝑖is independent and identically distributed as normal
random variables with mean zero and constant variance 𝜎2:
𝜖𝑖

∼Normal(0, 𝜎2).
The figure below shows the percentage body fat obtained from under water
weighing and the abdominal circumference measurements for 252 men. To pre-
dict body fat, the line overlayed on the scatter plot illustrates the best fitting

From the summary, we see that this model has an estimated slope,
̂𝛽, of 0.63
and an estimated 𝑦-intercept,
̂𝛼, of about -39.28%. This gives us the prediction
formula
̂
Bodyfat = −39.28 + 0.63 × Abdomen.
For every additional centimeter, we expect body fat to increase by 0.63%. The
negative 𝑦-intercept of course does not make sense as a physical model, but
neither does predicting a male with a waist of zero centimeters. Nevertheless,
this linear regression may be an accurate approximation for prediction purposes
for measurements that are in the observed range for this population.
Each of the residuals, which provide an estimate of the fitting error, is equal to
̂𝜖𝑖= 𝑦𝑖−
̂𝑦𝑖, the difference between the observed value 𝑦𝑖and the fitted value
̂𝑦𝑖=
̂𝛼+ ̂𝛽𝑥𝑖, where 𝑥𝑖is the abdominal circumference for the 𝑖th male.
̂𝜖𝑖is used
for diagnostics as well as estimating the constant variance in the assumption of
the model 𝜎2 via the mean squared error (MSE):

Here the degrees of freedom 𝑛−2 are the number of observations adjusted for
the number of parameters (which is 2) that we estimated in the regression. The
MSE,
̂𝜎2, may be calculated through squaring the residuals of the output of
bodyfat.lm.

If this model is correct, the residuals and fitted values should be uncorrelated,
and the expected value of the residuals is zero. We apply the scatterplot of
residuals versus fitted values, which provides an additional visual check of the
model adequacy.

With the exception of one observation for the individual with the largest fitted
value, the residual plot suggests that this linear regression is a reasonable ap-
proximation. The case number of the observation with the largest fitted value
can be obtained using the which function in R. Further examination of the data
frame shows that this case also has the largest waist measurement Abdomen.
This may be our potential outlier and we will have more discussion on outliers
in Section 6.2.

6.1.2
Bayesian Simple Linear Regression Using the Refer-
ence Prior
Let us now turn to the Bayesian version and show that under the reference
prior, we will obtain the posterior distributions of 𝛼and 𝛽analogous with the
frequentist OLS results.
The Bayesian model starts with the same model as the classical frequentist
approach:
𝑦𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖,
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛.
with the assumption that the errors, 𝜖𝑖, are independent and identically dis-
tributed as normal random variables with mean zero and constant variance 𝜎2.
This assumption is exactly the same as in the classical inference case for testing
and constructing confidence intervals for 𝛼and 𝛽.
Our goal is to update the distributions of the unknown parameters 𝛼, 𝛽, and
𝜎2, based on the data 𝑥1, 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛, where 𝑛is the number of observations.

120
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
Under the assumption that the errors 𝜖𝑖are normally distributed with constant
variance 𝜎2, we have for the random variable of each response 𝑌𝑖, conditioning
on the observed data 𝑥𝑖and the parameters 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2, is normally distributed:
𝑌𝑖| 𝑥𝑖, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖, 𝜎2),
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛.
That is, the likelihood of each 𝑌𝑖given 𝑥𝑖, 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2 is given by
𝑝(𝑦𝑖| 𝑥𝑖, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2) =
1
√
2𝜋𝜎2 exp (−(𝑦𝑖−(𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖))2
2𝜎2
) .
The likelihood of 𝑌1, ⋯, 𝑌𝑛is the product of each likelihood 𝑝(𝑦𝑖| 𝑥𝑖, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2),
since we assume each response 𝑌𝑖is independent from each other. Since this
likelihood depends on the values of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2, it is sometimes denoted as a
function of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2: ℒ(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2).
We first consider the case under the reference prior, which is our standard nonin-
formative prior. Using the reference prior, we will obtain familiar distributions
as the posterior distributions of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2, which gives the analogue to the
frequentist results. Here we assume the joint prior distribution of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2
to be proportional to the inverse of 𝜎2
𝑝(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2) ∝1
𝜎2 .
(6.1)
Using the hierachical model framework, this is equivalent to assuming that the
joint prior distribution of 𝛼and 𝛽under 𝜎2 is the uniform prior, while the prior
distribution of 𝜎2 is proportional to 1
𝜎2 . That is
𝑝(𝛼, 𝛽| 𝜎2) ∝1,
𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1
𝜎2 ,
Combining the two using conditional probability, we will get the same joint prior
distribution (6.1).
Then we apply the Bayes’ rule to derive the joint posterior distribution after
observing data 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛. Bayes’ rule states that the joint posterior distribution
of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2 is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the joint

6.1. BAYESIAN SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
121
prior distribution:
𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) ∝[
𝑛
∏
𝑖
𝑝(𝑦𝑖| 𝑥𝑖, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2)] 𝑝(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2)
∝[(

)) × ⋯
× (

2𝜎2
))] × ( 1
𝜎2 )
∝
1
(𝜎2)(𝑛+2)/2 exp (−∑𝑖(𝑦𝑖−𝛼−𝛽𝑥𝑖)
2
2𝜎2
)
To obtain the marginal posterior distribution of 𝛽, we need to integrate 𝛼and
𝜎2 out from the joint posterior distribution
𝑝∗(𝛽| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) = ∫
∞
0
(∫
∞
−∞
𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) 𝑑𝛼) 𝑑𝜎2.
We leave the detailed calculation in Section 6.1.4. It can be shown that the
marginal posterior distribution of 𝛽is the Student’s 𝑡-distribution
𝛽| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛽,
̂𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
) = t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛽, (se𝛽)2) ,
with degrees of freedom 𝑛−2, center at
̂𝛽, the slope estimate we obtained from
the frequentist OLS model, and scale parameter
̂𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
= (se𝛽)
2, which is the
square of the standard error of
̂𝛽under the frequentist OLS model.
Similarly, we can integrate out 𝛽and 𝜎2 from the joint posterior distribution
to get the marginal posterior distribution of 𝛼, 𝑝∗(𝛼| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛). It turns out
that 𝑝∗(𝛼| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) is again a Student’s 𝑡-distribution with degrees of freedom
𝑛−2, center at
̂𝛼, the 𝑦-intercept estimate from the frequentist OLS model, and
scale parameter
̂𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
S𝑥𝑥
) = (se𝛼)
2, which is the square of the standard
error of
̂𝛼under the frequentist OLS model
𝛼| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛼,
̂𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
S𝑥𝑥
)) = t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛼, (se𝛼)2) .
Finally, we can show that the marginal posterior distribution of 𝜎2 is the inverse
Gamma distribution, or equivalently, the reciprocal of 𝜎2, which is the precision
𝜙, follows the Gamma distribution
𝜙= 1
𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼Gamma (𝑛−2

2 ) .

122
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
Moreover, similar to the Normal-Gamma conjugacy under the reference prior
introduced in the previous chapters, the joint posterior distribution of 𝛽, 𝜎2, and
the joint posterior distribution of 𝛼, 𝜎2 are both Normal-Gamma. In particular,
the posterior distribution of 𝛽conditioning on 𝜎2 is
𝛽| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛽, 𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
) ,
and the posterior distribution of 𝛼conditioning on 𝜎2 is
𝛼| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛼, 𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
S𝑥𝑥
)) .
Credible Intervals for Slope 𝛽and 𝑦-Intercept 𝛼
The Bayesian posterior distribution results of 𝛼and 𝛽show that under the refer-
ence prior, the posterior credible intervals are in fact numerically equivalent
to the confidence intervals from the classical frequentist OLS analysis. This
provides a baseline analysis for other Bayesian analyses with other informative
prior distributions or perhaps other “objective” prior distributions, such as the
Cauchy distribution. (Cauchy distribution is the Student’s 𝑡prior with 1 degree
of freedom.)
Since the credible intervals are numerically the same as the confidence intervals,
we can use the lm function to obtain the OLS estimates and construct the
credible intervals of 𝛼and 𝛽
output = summary(bodyfat.lm)$coef[, 1:2]

The columns labeled Estimate and Std. Error are equivalent to the centers
(or posterior means) and scale parameters (or standard deviations) in the two
Student’s 𝑡-distributions respectively. The credible intervals of 𝛼and 𝛽are the
same as the frequentist confidence intervals, but now we can interpret them
from the Bayesian perspective.
The confint function provides 95% confidence intervals. Under the reference
prior, they are equivalent to the 95% credible intervals. The code below extracts
them and relabels the output as the Bayesian results.
out = cbind(output, confint(bodyfat.lm))
colnames(out) = c("posterior mean", "posterior std", "2.5", "97.5")

These intervals coincide with the confidence intervals from the frequentist ap-
proach. The primary difference is the interpretation. For example, based on
the data, we believe that there is a 95% chance that body fat will increase
by 5.75% up to 6.88% for every additional 10 centimeter increase in the waist
circumference.
Credible Intervals for the Mean 𝜇𝑌and the Prediction 𝑦𝑛+1
From our assumption of the model
𝑦𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖,
the mean of the response variable 𝑌, 𝜇𝑌, at the point 𝑥𝑖is
𝜇𝑌| 𝑥𝑖= 𝐸[𝑌| 𝑥𝑖] = 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖.
Under the reference prior, 𝜇𝑌has a posterior distributuion
𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖| data ∼t(𝑛−2,
̂𝛼+
̂𝛽𝑥𝑖, S2
𝑌|𝑋𝑖),
where
S2
𝑌|𝑋𝑖=
̂𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+ (𝑥𝑖−
̄𝑥)2
S𝑥𝑥
)
Any new prediction 𝑦𝑛+1 at a point 𝑥𝑛+1 also follows the Student’s 𝑡-distribution
𝑦𝑛+1 | data, 𝑥𝑛+1 ∼t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛼+
̂𝛽𝑥𝑛+1, S2
𝑌|𝑋𝑛+1) ,
where
S2
𝑌|𝑋𝑛+1 =
̂𝜎2 + ̂𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+ (𝑥𝑛+1 −
̄𝑥)2
S𝑥𝑥
) =
̂𝜎2 (1 + 1
𝑛+ (𝑥𝑛+1 −

S𝑥𝑥
) .
The variance for predicting a new observation 𝑦𝑛+1 has an extra
̂𝜎2 which comes
from the uncertainty of a new observation about the mean 𝜇𝑌estimated by the
regression line.
We can extract these intervals using the predict function
library(ggplot2)

Based on the data, a Bayesian would expect that a man with waist circumference
of 148.1 centimeters should have bodyfat of 54.216% with a 95% chance that it
is between 44.097% and 64.335%.
While we expect the majority of the data will be within the prediction intervals
(the short dashed grey lines), Case 39 seems to be well below the interval. We
next use Bayesian methods in Section 6.2 to calculate the probability that this
case is abnormal or is an outlier by falling more than 𝑘standard deviations from
either side of the mean.
6.1.3
Informative Priors
Except from the noninformative reference prior, we may also consider using a
more general semi-conjugate prior distribution of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2 when there is
information available about the parameters.
Since the data 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛are normally distributed, from Chapter 3 we see that
a Normal-Gamma distribution will form a conjugacy in this situation. We then
set up prior distributions through a hierarchical model. We first assume that,
given 𝜎2, 𝛼and 𝛽together follow the bivariate normal prior distribution, from

126
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
which their marginal distributions are both normal,
𝛼| 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝑎0, 𝜎2S𝛼)
𝛽| 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝑏0, 𝜎2S𝛽),
with covariance
Cov(𝛼, 𝛽| 𝜎2) = 𝜎2S𝛼𝛽.
Here, 𝜎2, 𝑆𝛼, 𝑆𝛽, and 𝑆𝛼𝛽are hyperparameters. This is equivalent to setting
the coeﬀicient vector 𝛽= (𝛼, 𝛽)𝑇1 to have a bivariate normal distribution with
covariance matrix Σ0
Σ0 = 𝜎2 ( 𝑆𝛼
𝑆𝛼𝛽
𝑆𝛼𝛽
𝑆𝛽
) .
That is,
𝛽= (𝛼, 𝛽)𝑇| 𝜎2 ∼BivariateNormal(b = (𝑎0, 𝑏0)𝑇, 𝜎2Σ0).
Then for 𝜎2, we will impose an inverse Gamma distribution as its prior distri-
bution
1/𝜎2 ∼Gamma (𝜈0
2 , 𝜈0𝜎0
2
) .
Now the joint prior distribution of 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2 form a distribution that is
analogous to the Normal-Gamma distribution. Prior information about 𝛼, 𝛽,
and 𝜎2 are encoded in the hyperparameters 𝑎0, 𝑏0, S𝛼, S𝛽, S𝛼𝛽, 𝜈0, and 𝜎0.
The marginal posterior distribution of the coeﬀicient vector 𝛽= (𝛼, 𝛽) will
be bivariate normal, and the marginal posterior distribution of 𝜎2 is again an
inverse Gamma distribution
1/𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼Gamma (𝜈0 + 𝑛
2
, 𝜈0𝜎2
0 + SSE
2
) .
One can see that the reference prior is the limiting case of this conjugate prior
we impose.
We usually use Gibbs sampling to approximate the joint poste-
rior distribution instead of using the result directly, especially when we have
more regression coeﬀicients in multiple linear regression models. We omit the
derivation of the posterior distributions due to the heavy use of advanced linear
algebra. One can refer to Hoff (2009) for more details.
Based on any prior information we have for the model, we can also impose other
priors and assumptions on 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2 to get different Bayesian results. Most
of these priors will not form any conjugacy and will require us to use simulation
methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for approximations. We
will introduce the general idea of MCMC in Chapter 8.
1(𝛼, 𝛽)𝑇means we transpose the row vector (𝛼, 𝛽) into a column vector ( 𝛼
𝛽).

Marginal Posterior Distribution of 𝛽
To get the marginal posterior distribution of 𝛽, we need to integrate out 𝛼and

can be viewed as part of a normal distribution of 𝛼, with mean
̂𝛼−(𝛽−̂𝛽) ̄𝑥, and
variance 𝜎2/𝑛. Therefore, the integral from the last line above is proportional
to √𝜎2/𝑛. We get
𝑝∗(𝛽, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) ∝

perform change of variable and set 𝜎2 = 1

where

∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−

̂𝛽from the
frequentist OLS model.
To summarize, under the reference prior, the marginal posterior distribution
of the slope of the Bayesian simple linear regression follows the Student’s 𝑡-
distribution
𝛽| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼t (𝑛−2,
̂𝛽, (se𝛽)
2)
6.1.6
Marginal Posterior Distribution of 𝛼
A similar approach will lead us to the marginal distribution of 𝛼. We again
start from the joint posterior distribution
𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) ∝
1
(𝜎2)(𝑛+2)/2 exp (−SSE + 𝑛(𝛼−
̂𝛼−(𝛽−
̂𝛽) ̄𝑥)2 + (𝛽−
̂𝛽)2 ∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−

2𝜎2
)
This time we integrate 𝛽and 𝜎2 out to get the marginal posterior distribution
of 𝛼. We first compute the integral
𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) = ∫

𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) 𝑑𝛽

Here we group the terms with 𝛽−
̂𝛽together, then complete the square so that

In the last line, we use the same trick as we did for 𝛽to derive the form of the
Student’s 𝑡-distribution. This shows that the marginal posterior distribution
of 𝛼also follows a Student’s 𝑡-distribution, with 𝑛−2 degrees of freedom. Its
center is
̂𝛼, the estimate of 𝛼in the frequentist OLS estimate, and its scale
parameter is
̂𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−
̄𝑥)2 ), which is the square of the standard error
of
̂𝛼.
6.1.7
Marginal Posterior Distribution of 𝜎2
To show that the marginal posterior distribution of 𝜎2 follows the inverse
Gamma distribution, we only need to show the precision 𝜙=
1
𝜎2 follows a
Gamma distribution.
We have shown in Week 3 that taking the prior distribution of 𝜎2 proportional
to 1
𝜎2 is equivalent to taking the prior distribution of 𝜙proportional to 1
𝜙
𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1
𝜎2
⟹
𝑝(𝜙) ∝1
𝜙
Therefore, under the parameters 𝛼, 𝛽, and the precision 𝜙, we have the joint
prior distribution as
𝑝(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜙) ∝1
𝜙
and the joint posterior distribution as
𝑝∗(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜙| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛) ∝𝜙
𝑛
2 −1 exp (−∑𝑖(𝑦𝑖−𝛼−𝛽𝑥𝑖)

𝜙= 1/𝜎2 | 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼Gamma (𝑛−2

That is,
𝑝(𝜙| data) ∝𝜙

6.1.8
Joint Normal-Gamma Posterior Distributions
Recall that the joint posterior distribution of 𝛽and 𝜎2 is
𝑝∗(𝛽, 𝜎2 | data) ∝
1
𝜎𝑛+1 exp (−SSE + (𝛽−
̂𝛽)2 ∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−
̄𝑥)2

) .
If we rewrite this using precision 𝜙= 1/𝜎2, we get the joint posterior distribution
of 𝛽and 𝜙to be
𝑝∗(𝛽, 𝜙| data) ∝𝜙
𝑛−2
2 exp (−𝜙
2 (SSE + (𝛽−
̂𝛽)2 ∑
𝑖
(𝑥𝑖−

This joint posterior distribution can be viewed as the product of the posterior
distribution of 𝛽conditioning on 𝜙and the posterior distribution of 𝜙,
𝜋∗(𝛽| 𝜙, data)×𝜋∗(𝜙| data) ∝[𝜙exp (−𝜙
2 (𝛽−
̂𝛽)2 ∑
𝑖
(𝑥𝑖−

𝑛−2
2 −1 exp (−SSE

134
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
The first term in the product is exactly the Normal distribution with mean
̂𝛽
and standard deviation
𝜎2
∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−
̄𝑥)2 = 𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
𝛽| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛽,
𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
) .
The second term is the Gamma distribution of the precision 𝜙, or the inverse
Gamma distribution of the variance 𝜎2
1/𝜎2 | data ∼Gamma (𝑛−2
2
, SSE
2 ) .
This means, the joint posterior distribution of 𝛽and 𝜎2, under the reference
prior, is a Normal-Gamma distribution. Similarly, the joint posterior distribu-
tion of 𝛼and 𝜎2 is also a Normal-Gamma distribution.
𝛼| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛼, 𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
S𝑥𝑥
)) ,
1/𝜎2 | data ∼Gamma (𝑛−2
2
, SSE
2 ) .
In fact, when we impose the bivariate normal distribution on 𝛽= (𝛼, 𝛽)𝑇, and
the inverse Gamma distribution on 𝜎2, as we have discussed in Section 6.1.3, the
joint posterior distribution of 𝛽and 𝜎2 is a Normal-Gamma distribution. Since
the reference prior is just the limiting case of this informative prior, it is not
surprising that we will also get the limiting case Normal-Gamma distribution
for 𝛼, 𝛽, and 𝜎2.
6.2
Checking Outliers
The plot and predictive intervals suggest that predictions for Case 39 are not
well captured by the model. There is always the possibility that this case does
not meet the assumptions of the simple linear regression model (wrong mean or
variance) or could be in error. Model diagnostics such as plots of residuals versus
fitted values are useful in identifying potential outliers. Now with the interpre-
tation of Bayesian paradigm, we can go further to calculate the probability to
demonstrate whether a case falls too far from the mean.
The article by Chaloner and Brant (1988) suggested an approach for defining
outliers and then calculating the probability that a case or multiple cases were
outliers, based on the posterior information of all observations. The assumed
model for our simple linear regression is 𝑦𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖, with 𝜖𝑖having inde-
pendent, identical distributions that are normal with mean zero and constant
variance 𝜎2, i.e., 𝜖𝑖
iid
∼Normal(0, 𝜎2). Chaloner & Brant considered outliers to
be points where the error or the model discrepancy 𝜖𝑖is greater than 𝑘stan-
dard deviations for some large 𝑘, and then proceed to calculate the posterior
probability that a case 𝑗is an outlier to be
𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| data)
(6.2)

6.2. CHECKING OUTLIERS
135
Since 𝜖𝑗= 𝑦𝑗−𝛼−𝛽𝑥𝑗, this is equivalent to calculating
𝑃(|𝑦𝑗−𝛼−𝛽𝑥𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| data).
6.2.1
Posterior Distribution of 𝜖𝑗Conditioning On 𝜎2
At the end of Section 6.1, we have discussed the posterior distributions of 𝛼and
𝛽. It turns out that under the reference prior, both posterior distributions of 𝛼
and 𝛽, conditioning on 𝜎2, are both normal
𝛼| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛼, 𝜎2 ( 1
𝑛+
̄𝑥2
S𝑥𝑥
)) ,
𝛽| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal ( ̂𝛽, 𝜎2
S𝑥𝑥
) .
Using this information, we can obtain the posterior distribution of any residual
𝜖𝑗= 𝑦𝑗−𝛼−𝛽𝑥𝑗conditioning on 𝜎2
𝜖𝑗| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal (𝑦𝑗−
̂𝛼−
̂𝛽𝑥𝑗, 𝜎2 ∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑗)2
𝑛S𝑥𝑥
) .
(6.3)
Since
̂𝛼+ ̂𝛽𝑥𝑗is exactly the fitted value ̂𝑦𝑗, the mean of this Normal distribution is
𝑦𝑗−̂𝑦𝑗=
̂𝜖𝑗, which is the residual under the OLS estimates of the 𝑗th observation.
Using this posterior distribution and the property of conditional probability,
we can calculate the probability that the error 𝜖𝑗lies outside of 𝑘standard
deviations of the mean, defined in equation (6.2)
𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| data) = ∫
∞
0
𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| 𝜎2, data)𝑝(𝜎2 | data) 𝑑𝜎2.
(6.4)
The probability 𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| 𝜎2, data) can be calculated using the posterior
distribution of 𝜖𝑗conditioning on 𝜎2 (6.3)
𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| 𝜎2, data) = ∫

𝑛S𝑥𝑥
, we can use the 𝑧-score and 𝑧-table to look for
this number. Let
𝑧∗= 𝜖𝑗−̂𝜖𝑗

CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION

That is the upper tail of the area under the standard Normal distribution when
𝑧∗is larger than the critical value
𝑘−̂𝜖𝑗/𝜎
√∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑗)2/S𝑥𝑥
.
The second integral, ∫

𝑝(𝜖𝑗| 𝜎2, data) 𝑑𝜖𝑗, is the same as the probability

which is the lower tail of the area under the standard Normal distribution when
𝑧∗is smaller than the critical value
−𝑘−̂𝜖𝑗/𝜎
√∑𝑖(𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑗)2/S𝑥𝑥
.
After obtaining the two probabilities, we can move on to calculate the proba-
bility 𝑃(|𝜖𝑗| > 𝑘𝜎| data) using the formula given by (6.4). Since manual calcu-
lation is complicated, we often use numerical integration functions provided in
R to finish the final integral.
6.2.2
Implementation Using BAS Package
The code for calculating the probability of outliers involves integration. We
have implemented this in the function Bayes.outlier from the BAS package.
This function takes an lm object and the value of k as arguments. Applying
this to the bodyfat data for Case 39, we get
# Load `BAS` library and data. Run linear regression as in Section 6.1
library(BAS)
data(bodyfat)
bodyfat.lm = lm(Bodyfat ~ Abdomen, data = bodyfat)
#
outliers = Bayes.outlier(bodyfat.lm, k=3)
# Extract the probability that Case 39 is an outlier
prob.39 = outliers$prob.outlier[39]
prob.39
## [1] 0.9916833

6.2. CHECKING OUTLIERS
137
We see that this case has an extremely high probability of 0.992 of being more
an outlier, that is, the error is greater than 𝑘= 3 standard deviations, based on
the fitted model and data.
With 𝑘= 3, however, there may be a high probability a priori of at least one out-
lier in a large sample. Let 𝑝= 𝑃(any error 𝜖𝑗lies within 3 standard deviations) =
𝑃(observation 𝑗is not a outlier).
Since we assume the prior distribution of
𝜖𝑗is normal, we can calculate 𝑝using the pnorm function. Let Φ(𝑧) be the
cumulative distribution of the standard Normal distribution, that is,
Φ(𝑧) = ∫
𝑧
−∞
1
√
2𝜋
exp (−𝑥2
2 ) 𝑑𝑥.
Then 𝑝= 1 −2Φ(−𝑘) = 1 −2Φ(−3).2 Since we assume 𝜖𝑗is independent, that
the probability of no outlier is just the 𝑛th power of 𝑝. The event of getting at
least 1 outlier is the complement of the event of getting no outliers. Therefore,
the probability of getting at least 1 outlier is
𝑃(at least 1 outlier) = 1 −𝑃(no outlier) = 1 −𝑝𝑛= 1 −(1 −2Φ(−3))𝑛.
We can compute this in R using
n = nrow(bodyfat)
# probability of no outliers if outliers have errors greater than 3 standard deviation
prob = (1 - (2 * pnorm(-3))) ^ n
prob
## [1] 0.5059747
# probability of at least one outlier
prob.least1 = 1 - (1 - (2 * pnorm(-3))) ^ n
prob.least1
## [1] 0.4940253
With 𝑛= 252, the probability of at least one outlier is much larger than say the
marginal probability that one point is an outlier of 0.05. So we would expect
that there will be at least one point where the error is more than 3 standard
deviations from zero almost 50% of the time. Rather than fixing 𝑘, we can fix
the prior probability of no outliers 𝑃(no outlier) = 1 −𝑝𝑛to be say 0.95, and
back solve the value of 𝑘using the qnorm function
new_k = qnorm(0.5 + 0.5 * 0.95 ^ (1 / n))
new_k
## [1] 3.714602
2Φ(−𝑘) actually represents the area of the lower tail under the standard Normal distribution
curve 𝑘standard deviations away from the mean 0.

138
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
This leads to a larger value of 𝑘. After adjusting 𝑘the prior probability of no
outliers is 0.95, we examine Case 39 again under this 𝑘
# Calculate probability of being outliers using new `k` value
outliers.new = Bayes.outlier(bodyfat.lm, k = new_k)
# Extract the probability of Case 39
prob.new.39 = outliers.new$prob.outlier[39]
prob.new.39
## [1] 0.6847509
The posterior probability of Case 39 being an outlier is about 0.685. While this
is not strikingly large, it is much larger than the marginal prior probability of
for a value lying about 3.7𝜎away from 0, if we assume the error 𝜖𝑗is normally
distributed with mean 0 and variance 𝜎2.
2 * pnorm(-new_k)
## [1] 0.0002035241
There is a substantial probability that Case 39 is an outlier. If you do view it
as an outlier, what are your options? One option is to investigate the case and
determine if the data are input incorrectly, and fix it. Another option is when
you cannot confirm there is a data entry error, you may delete the observation
from the analysis and refit the model without the case. If you do take this
option, be sure to describe what you did so that your research is reproducible.
You may want to apply diagnostics and calculate the probability of a case being
an outlier using this reduced data. As a word of caution, if you discover that
there are a large number of points that appear to be outliers, take a second look
at your model assumptions, since the problem may be with the model rather
than the data! A third option we will talk about later, is to combine inference
under the model that retains this case as part of the population, and the model
that treats it as coming from another population. This approach incorporates
our uncertainty about whether the case is an outlier given the data.
The code of Bayes.outlier function is based on using a reference prior for
the linear model and extends to multiple regression.
6.3
Bayesian Multiple Linear Regression
In this section, we will discuss Bayesian inference in multiple linear regression.
We will use the reference prior to provide the default or base line analysis of
the model, which provides the correspondence between Bayesian and frequentist
approaches.

6.3. BAYESIAN MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION

6.3.1
The Model
To illustrate the idea, we use the data set on kid’s cognitive scores that we
examined earlier. We predicted the value of the kid’s cognitive score from the
mother’s high school status, mother’s IQ score, whether or not the mother
worked during the first three years of the kid’s life, and the mother’s age. We
set up the model as follows
𝑦score,𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽1𝑥hs,𝑖+ 𝛽2𝑥IQ,𝑖+ 𝛽3𝑥work,𝑖+ 𝛽4𝑥age,𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖,
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛. (6.5)
Here, 𝑦score,𝑖is the 𝑖th kid’s cognitive score.
𝑥hs,𝑖, 𝑥IQ,𝑖, 𝑥work,𝑖, and 𝑥age,𝑖
represent the high school status, the IQ score, the work status during the first
three years of the kid’s life, and the age of the 𝑖th kid’s mother. 𝜖𝑖is the error
term. 𝑛denotes the number of observations in this data set.
For better analyses, one usually centers the variable, which ends up getting the
following form
𝑦score,𝑖= 𝛽0+𝛽1(𝑥hs,𝑖−̄𝑥hs)+𝛽2(𝑥IQ,𝑖−̄𝑥IQ)+𝛽3(𝑥work,𝑖−̄𝑥work)+𝛽4(𝑥age,𝑖−̄𝑥age)+𝜖𝑖.
(6.6)
Under this tranformation, the coeﬀicients, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝛽3, 𝛽4, that are in front of the
variables, are unchanged compared to the ones in (6.5). However, the constant
coeﬀicient 𝛽0 is no longer the constant coeﬀicient 𝛼in (6.5). Instead, under the
assumption that 𝜖𝑖is independently, identically normal,
̂𝛽0 is the sample mean
of the response variable 𝑌score.3 This provides more meaning to 𝛽0 as this is
the mean of 𝑌when each of the predictors is equal to their respective means.
Moreover, it is more convenient to use this “centered” model to derive analyses.
The R codes in the BAS package are based on the form (6.6).
6.3.2
Data Pre-processing
We can download the data set from Gelman’s website and read the summary
information of the data set using the read.dta function in the foreign package.

From the summary statistics, variables mom_hs and mom_work should be con-
sidered as categorical variables.
We transform them into indicator variables
where mom_work = 1 if the mother worked for 1 or more years, and mom_hs =
1 indicates the mother had more than a high school education.
The code is as below:4
cognitive$mom_work = as.numeric(cognitive$mom_work > 1)
cognitive$mom_hs = as.numeric(cognitive$mom_hs > 0)
# Modify column names of the data set
colnames(cognitive) = c("kid_score", "hs", "IQ", "work", "age")
6.3.3
Specify Bayesian Prior Distributions
For Bayesian inference, we need to specify a prior distribution for the error term
𝜖𝑖. Since each kid’s cognitive score 𝑦score,𝑖is continuous, we assume that 𝜖𝑖is
independent, and identically distributed with the Normal distribution
𝜖𝑖
iid
∼Normal(0, 𝜎2),
where 𝜎2 is the commonly shared variance of all observations.
We will also need to specify the prior distributions for all the coeﬀicients
𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝛽3, and 𝛽4. An informative prior, which assumes that the 𝛽’s follow
the multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix 𝜎2Σ0 can be used.
We may further impose the inverse Gamma distribution to 𝜎2, to complete the
hierachical model
𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝛽3, 𝛽4 | 𝜎2 ∼Normal((𝑏0, 𝑏1, 𝑏2, 𝑏3, 𝑏4)𝑇, 𝜎2Σ0)
1/𝜎2
∼Gamma(𝜈0/2, 𝜈0𝜎2
0/2)
This gives us the multivariate Normal-Gamma conjugate family, with hyperpa-
rameters 𝑏0, 𝑏1, 𝑏2, 𝑏3, 𝑏4, Σ0, 𝜈0, and 𝜎2
0. For this prior, we will need to specify
4Note: as.numeric is not necessary here. We use as.numeric to keep the names of the
levels of the two variables short.

6.3. BAYESIAN MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
141
the values of all the hyperparameters. This elicitation can be quite involved,
especially when we do not have enough prior information about the variances,
covariances of the coeﬀicients and other prior hyperparameters. Therefore, we
are going to adopt the noninformative reference prior, which is a limiting case
of this multivariate Normal-Gamma prior.
The reference prior in the multiple linear regression model is similar to the refer-
ence prior we used in the simple linear regression model. The prior distribution
of all the coeﬀicients 𝛽’s conditioning on 𝜎2 is the uniform prior, and the prior
of 𝜎2 is proportional to its reciprocal
𝑝(𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝛽3, 𝛽4 | 𝜎2) ∝1,
𝑝(𝜎2) ∝1
𝜎2 .
Under this reference prior, the marginal posterior distributions of the coeﬀi-
cients, 𝛽’s, are parallel to the ones in simple linear regression. The marginal
posterior distribution of 𝛽𝑗is the Student’s 𝑡-distributions with centers given by
the frequentist OLS estimates
̂𝛽𝑗, scale parameter given by the standard error
(se𝛽𝑗)2 obtained from the OLS estimates
𝛽𝑗| 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛∼t(𝑛−𝑝−1,
̂𝛽𝑗, (se𝛽𝑗)2),
𝑗= 0, 1, ⋯, 𝑝.
The degree of freedom of these 𝑡-distributions is 𝑛−𝑝−1, where 𝑝is the number
of predictor variables. In the kid’s cognitive score example, 𝑝= 4. The posterior
mean,
̂𝛽𝑗, is the center of the 𝑡-distribution of 𝛽𝑗, which is the same as the OLS
estimates of 𝛽𝑗. The posterior standard deviation of 𝛽𝑗, which is the square
root of the scale parameter of the 𝑡-distribution, is se𝛽𝑗, the standard error of
𝛽𝑗under the OLS estimates. That means, under the reference prior, we can
easily obtain the posterior mean and posterior standard deviation from using
the lm function, since they are numerically equivalent to the counterpart of the
frequentist approach.
6.3.4
Fitting the Bayesian Model
To gain more flexibility in choosing priors, we will instead use the bas.lm func-
tion in the BAS library, which allows us to specify different model priors and
coeﬀicient priors.
# Import library
library(BAS)
# Use `bas.lm` to run regression model
cog.bas = bas.lm(kid_score ~ ., data = cognitive, prior = "BIC",
modelprior = Bernoulli(1),
include.always = ~ .,
n.models = 1)

142
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION
The above bas.lm function uses the same model formula as in the lm. It first
specifies the response and predictor variables, a data argument to provide the
data frame. The additional arguments further include the prior on the coef-
ficients. We use "BIC" here to indicate that the model is based on the non-
informative reference prior. (We will explain in the later section why we use
the name "BIC".) Since we will only provide one model, which is the one that
includes all variables, we place all model prior probability to this exact model.
This is specified in the modelprior = Bernoulli(1) argument. Because we
want to fit using all variables, we use include.always = ~ . to indicate that
the intercept and all 4 predictors are included. The argument n.models = 1
fits just this one model.
6.3.5
Posterior Means and Posterior Standard Deviations
Similar to the OLS regression process, we can extract the posterior means and
standard deviations of the coeﬀicients using the coef function
cog.coef = coef(cog.bas)

From the last column in this summary, we see that the probability of the co-
eﬀicients to be non-zero is always 1. This is because we specify the argument
include.always = ~ . to force the model to include all variables. Notice on
the first row we have the statistics of the Intercept 𝛽0. The posterior mean
of 𝛽0 is 86.8, which is completely different from the original 𝑦-intercept of this
model under the frequentist OLS regression. As we have stated previously, we
consider the “centered” model under the Bayesian framework. Under this “cen-
tered” model and the reference prior, the posterior mean of the Intercept 𝛽0
is now the sample mean of the response variable 𝑌score.
We can visualize the coeﬀicients 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝛽3, 𝛽4 using the plot function. We
use the subset argument to plot only the coeﬀicients of the predictors.
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), col.lab = "darkgrey", col.axis = "darkgrey", col = "darkgrey")
plot(cog.coef, subset = 2:5, ask = F)

Credible Intervals Summary
We can also report the posterior means, posterior standard deviations, and
the 95% credible intervals of the coeﬀicients of all 4 predictors, which may
give a clearer and more useful summary. The BAS library provides the method
confint to extract the credible intervals from the output cog.coef. If we are
only interested in the distributions of the coeﬀicients of the 4 predictors, we
may use the parm argument to restrict the variables shown in the summary

As in the simple linear aggression, the posterior estimates from the reference
prior, that are in the table, are equivalent to the numbers reported from
the lm function in R, or using the confident function in the OLS estimates.
These intervals are centered at the posterior mean
̂𝛽𝑗with width given by the
appropriate 𝑡quantile with 𝑛−𝑝−1 degrees of freedom times the posterior
standard deviation se𝛽𝑗.
The primary difference is the interpretation
of the intervals.
For example, given this data, we believe there is a 95%
chance that the kid’s cognitive score increases by 0.44 to 0.68 with one additional
increase of the mother’s IQ score. The mother’s high school status has a larger
effect where we believe that there is a 95% chance the kid would score of 0.55
up to 9.64 points higher if the mother had three or more years of high school.
The credible intervals of the predictors work and age include 0, which implies
that we may improve this model so that the model will accomplish a desired
level of explanation or prediction with fewer predictors. We will explore model
selection using Bayesian information criterion in the next chapter.
6.4
Summary
We have provided Bayesian analyses for both simple linear regression and multi-
ple linear regression using the default reference prior. We have seen that, under
this reference prior, the marginal posterior distribution of the coeﬀicients is the
Student’s 𝑡-distribution. Therefore, the posterior mean and posterior standard
deviation of any coeﬀicients are numerically equivalent to the corresponding fre-
quentist OLS estimate and the standard error. This has provided us a base line
analysis of Bayesian approach, which we can extend later when we introduce
more different coeﬀicient priors.
The difference is the interpretation. Since we have obtained the distribution of
each coeﬀicient, we can construct the credible interval, which provides us the

6.4. SUMMARY
145
probability that a specific coeﬀicient falls into this credible interval.
We have also used the posterior distribution to analyze the probability of a
particular observation being an outlier. We defined such probabiilty to be the
probability that the error term is 𝑘standard deviations away from 0.
This
probability is based on information of all data, instead of just the observation
itself.

146
CHAPTER 6. INTRODUCTION TO BAYESIAN REGRESSION

Chapter 7
Bayesian Model Choice
In Section 6.3 of Chapter 6, we provided a Bayesian inference analysis for kid’s
cognitive scores using multiple linear regression. We found that several credible
intervals of the coeﬀicients contain zero, suggesting that we could potentially
simplify the model.
In this chapter, we will discuss model selection, model
uncertainty, and model averaging. Bayesian model selection is to pick variables
for multiple linear regression based on Bayesian information criterion, or BIC.
Later, we will also discuss other model selection methods, such as using Bayes
factors.
7.1
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
In inferential statistics, we compare model selections using 𝑝-values or adjusted
𝑅2. Here we will take the Bayesian propectives. We are going to discuss the
Bayesian model selections using the Bayesian information criterion, or BIC. BIC
is one of the Bayesian criteria used for Bayesian model selection, and tends to
be one of the most popular criteria.
7.1.1
Definition of BIC
The Bayesian information criterion, BIC, is defined to be
BIC = −2 ln(
̂
likelihood) + (𝑝+ 1) ln(𝑛).
(7.1)
Here 𝑛is the number of observations in the model, and 𝑝is the number of
predictors. That is, 𝑝+ 1 is the number of total parameters (also the total
number of coeﬀicients, including the intercept) in the model. Recall that in the
Bayesian simple linear regression (Section 6.1), we mentioned the likelihood of
147

148
CHAPTER 7. BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE
the model 𝑦𝑖= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑥𝑖+ 𝜖𝑖is the probability (or probability distribution) for
the observed data 𝑦𝑖, 𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛occur under the given parameters 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2
likelihood = 𝑝(𝑦𝑖| 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2) = ℒ(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝜎2),
where 𝜎2 is the variance of the assumed Normal distribution of the error term
𝜖𝑖. In general, under any model 𝑀, we can write the likelihood of this model as
the function of parameter 𝜃(𝜃may be a vector of several parameters) and the
model 𝑀
likelihood = 𝑝(data | 𝜃, 𝑀) = ℒ(𝜃, 𝑀).
If the likelihood function ℒ(𝜃, 𝑀) is nice enough (say it has local maximum), the
maximized value of the likelihood,
̂
likelihood, can be achieved by some special
value of the parameter 𝜃, denoted as
̂𝜃
̂
likelihood = 𝑝(data |
̂𝜃, 𝑀) = ℒ( ̂𝜃, 𝑀).
This is the likelihood that defines BIC.
When the sample size 𝑛is large enough and the data distribution belongs to the
exponential family such as the Normal distribution, BIC can be approximated
by -2 times likelihood that data are produced under model 𝑀:
BIC ≈−2 ln(𝑝(data | 𝑀)) = −2 ln (∫𝑝(data | 𝜃, 𝑀)𝑝(𝜃| 𝑀) 𝑑𝜃) ,
when 𝑛is large.
(7.2)
Here 𝑝(𝜃| 𝑀) is the prior distribution of the parameter 𝜃.
We will not go
into detail why the approximation holds and how we perform the integration
in this book. However, we wanted to remind readers that, since BIC can be
approximated by the prior distribution of the parameter 𝜃, we will see later how
we utilize BIC to approximate the model likelihood under the reference prior.1
One more observation of formula (7.2) is that it involves the marginal likelihood
of data under model 𝑀, 𝑝(data | 𝑀). We have seen this quantity when we
introduced Bayes factor between two hypotheses or models
BF[𝑀1 ∶𝑀2] = 𝑝(data | 𝑀1)
𝑝(data | 𝑀2).
This also provides connection between BIC and Bayes factor, which we will
leverage later.
Similar to AIC, the Akaike information criterion, the model with the smallest
BIC is preferrable. Formula (7.1) can be re-expressed using the model 𝑅2, which
is easier to calculate
BIC = 𝑛ln(1 −𝑅2) + (𝑝+ 1) ln(𝑛) + constant,
(7.3)
1Recall that the reference prior is the limiting case of the multivariate Normal-Gamma
distribution.

7.1. BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION (BIC)
149
where the last term constant only depends on the sample size 𝑛, and the observed
data 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛. Since this constant does not depend on the choice of model, i.e.,
the choice of variables, ignoring this constant will not affect the comparison of
BICs between models. Therefore, we usually define BIC to be
BIC = 𝑛ln(1 −𝑅2) + (𝑝+ 1) ln(𝑛).
From this expression, we see that adding more predictors, that is, increasing
𝑝, will result in larger 𝑅2, which leads to a smaller ln(1 −𝑅2) in the first
term of BIC. While larger 𝑅2 means better goodness of fit of the data, too
many predictors may result in overfitting the data. Therefore, the second term
(𝑝+ 1) ln(𝑛) is added in the BIC expression to penalize models with too many
predictors. When 𝑝increases, the second term increases as well. This provides
a trade-off between the goodness of fit given by the first term and the model
complexity represented by the second term.
7.1.2
Backward Elimination with BIC
We will use the kid’s cognitive score data set cognitive as an example. We
first read in the data set from Gelman’s website and transform the data types
of the two variables mom_work and mom_hs, like what we did in Section 6.3.
# Load the library in order to read in data from website
library(foreign)
# Read in cognitive score data set and process data tranformations
cognitive = read.dta("http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/child.iq/kidiq.dta")
cognitive$mom_work = as.numeric(cognitive$mom_work > 1)
cognitive$mom_hs =
as.numeric(cognitive$mom_hs > 0)
colnames(cognitive) = c("kid_score", "hs","IQ", "work", "age")
We start with the full model, with all possible predictors: hs, IQ, work, and age.
We will drop one variable at a time and record all BICs. Then we will choose
the model with the smallest BIC. We will repeat this process until none of the
models yields a decrease in BIC. We use the step function in R to perform
the BIC model selection. Notice the default value of the k argument in the
step function is k=2, which is for the AIC score. For BIC, k should be log(n)
correspondingly.
# Compute the total number of observations
n = nrow(cognitive)
# Full model using all predictors
cog.lm = lm(kid_score ~ ., data=cognitive)
# Perform BIC elimination from full model

In the summary chart, the AIC should be interpreted as BIC, since we have
chosen to use the BIC expression where 𝑘= ln(𝑛).
From the full model, we predict the kid’s cognitive score from mother’s high
school status, mother’s IQ score, mother’s work status and mother’s age. The
BIC for the full model is 2541.1.
At the first step, we try to remove each variable from the full model to record the
resulting new BIC. From the summary statistics, we see that removing variable
age results in the smallest BIC. But if we try to drop the IQ variable, this will
increase the BIC, which implies that IQ would be a really important predictor
of kid_score. Comparing all the results, we drop the age variable at the first
step. After dropping age, the new BIC is 2535.4.
At the next step, we see that dropping work variable will result in the lowest
BIC, which is 2530.6. Now the model has become
score ∼hs + IQ

7.1. BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION (BIC)
151
Finally, when we try dropping either hs or IQ, it will result in higher BIC than
2530.6. This suggests that we have reached the best model. This model predicts
kid’s cognitive score using mother’s high school status and mother’s IQ score.
However, using the adjusted 𝑅2, the best model would be the one including not
only hs and IQ variables, but also mother’s work status, work. In general, using
BIC leads to fewer variables for the best model compared to using adjusted 𝑅2
or AIC.
We can also use the BAS package to find the best BIC model without taking the
stepwise backward process.

Here we set the modelprior argument as uniform() to assign equal prior prob-
ability for each possible model.
The logmarg information inside the cog.BIC summary list records the log of
marginal likelihood of each model after seeing the data ln(𝑝(data | 𝑀)). Recall
that this is approximately proportional to negative BIC when the sample size
𝑛is large
BIC ≈−2 ln(𝑝(data | 𝑀)).
We can use this information to retrieve the model with the largest log of marginal
likelihood, which corresponds to the model with the smallest BIC.

slots of the 5-dimensional vector (1, 1, 1, 0, 0).
7.1.3
Coeﬀicient Estimates Under Reference Prior for
Best BIC Model
The best BIC model 𝑀can be set up as follows and we have adopted the
“centered” model convention for convenient analyses
𝑦score,𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑥hs,𝑖−
̄𝑥hs,𝑖) + 𝛽2(𝑥IQ,𝑖−
̄𝑥IQ) + 𝜖𝑖,
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛
We would like to get the posterior distributions of the coeﬀicients 𝛽0, 𝛽1, and
𝛽2 under this model. Recall that the reference prior imposes a uniformly flat
prior distribution on coeﬀicients 𝑝(𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2 | 𝑀) ∝1 and that 𝑝(𝜎2 | 𝑀) ∝
1/𝜎2, so together the joint prior distribution 𝑝(𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝜎2 | 𝑀) is propor-
tional to 1/𝜎2.
When the sample size 𝑛is large, any proper prior distribu-
tion 𝑝(𝛽0, 𝛽1, 𝛽2, 𝜎2 | 𝑀) is getting flatter and flatter, which can be approxi-
mated by the reference prior. At the same time, the log of marginal likelihood
ln(𝑝(data | 𝑀)) can be approximated by the BIC. Therefore, we use prior =
"BIC" in the bas.lm function when we use the BIC as an approximation of the
log of marginal likelihood under the reference prior. The posterior mean of 𝛽0
in the result is the sample mean of the kids’ cognitive scores, or
̄𝑌score, since we
have centered the model.
# Fit the best BIC model by imposing which variables to be used using the indicators
cog.bestBIC = bas.lm(kid_score ~ ., data = cognitive,
prior = "BIC", n.models = 1,
# We only fit 1 model

Comparing the coeﬀicients in the best model with the ones in the full model
(which can be found in Section 6.3), we see that the 95% credible interval for IQ
variable is the same. However, the credible interval for high school status hs has
shifted slightly to the right, and it is also slighly narrower, meaning a smaller
posterior standard deviation.
All credible intervals of coeﬀicients exclude 0,
suggesting that we have found a parsimonious model.2
7.1.4
Other Criteria
BIC is one of the criteria based on penalized likelihoods. Other examples such
as AIC (Akaike information criterion) or adjusted 𝑅2, employ the form of
−2 ln(
̂
likelihood) + (𝑝+ 1) × some constant,
where 𝑝is the number of predictor variables and “some constant” is a con-
stant value depending on different criteria. BIC tends to select parsimonious
models (with fewer predictor variables) while AIC and adjusted 𝑅2 may include
variables that are not statistically significant, but may do better for predictions.
Other Bayesian model selection decisions may be based on selecting models with
the highest posterior probability. If predictions are important, we can use deci-
sion theory to help pick the model with the smallest expected prediction error.
In addiciton to goodness of fit and parsimony, loss functions that include costs
associated with collecting variables for predictive models may be of important
consideration.
2A parsimonious model is a model that accomplishes a desired level of explanation or
prediction with as few predictor variables as possible. More discussion of parsimonious models
can be found in Course 3 Linear Regression and Modeling.

CHAPTER 7. BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE
7.2
Bayesian Model Uncertainty
In the last section, we discussed how to use Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) to pick the best model, and we demonstrated the method on the kid’s
cognitive score data set.
However, we may often have several models with
similar BIC. If we only pick the one with the lowest BIC, we may ignore the
presence of other models that are equally good or can provide useful information.
The credible intervals of coeﬀicients may be narrower since the uncertainty is
being ignored when we consider only one model. Narrower intervals are not
always better if they miss the true values of the parameters. To account for the
uncertainty, getting the posterior probability of all possible models is necessary.
In this section, we will talk about how to convert BIC into Bayes factor to
find the posterior probability of all possible models. We will again use the BAS
package in R to achieve this goal.
7.2.1
Model Uncertainty
When forecasting the path of a hurricane, having an accurate prediction and
measurement of uncertainty is important for early warning. In this case, we
would consider the probability of several potential paths that the hurricane may
make landfall. Similar to hurricane forecasting, we would also like to obtain the
posterior probability of all possible models for uncertainty measurement.
To represent model uncertainty, we need to construct a probability distribution
over all possible models where the each probability provides measure of how
likely the model is to happen.
Suppose we have a multiple linear regression
𝑦𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑥1,𝑖−
̄𝑥1) + 𝛽2(𝑥2,𝑖−
̄𝑥2) + ⋯+ 𝛽𝑝(𝑥𝑝,𝑖−
̄𝑥𝑝) + 𝜖𝑖,
1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛,
with 𝑝predictor variables 𝑥1, ⋯, 𝑥𝑝. There are in total 2𝑝different models, cor-
responding to 2𝑝combinations of variable selections. there are 2 possibilities for
each variable: either getting selected or not, and we have in total 𝑝variables.
We denote each model as 𝑀𝑚, 𝑚= 1, ⋯, 2𝑝. To obtian the posterior probabil-
ity of each model 𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data), Bayes’ rule tells that that we need to assign
the prior probability 𝑝(𝑀𝑚) to each model, and to then obtain the marginal
likelihood of each model 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚). By Bayes’ rule, we update the posterior
probability of each model 𝑀𝑚after seeing the date, via marginal likelihood of
model 𝑀𝑚:
𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data) =
marginal likelihood of 𝑀𝑚× 𝑝(𝑀𝑚)
∑
2𝑝
𝑗=1 marginal likelihood of 𝑀𝑗× 𝑝(𝑀𝑗)
=
𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚)𝑝(𝑀𝑚)
∑
2𝑝
𝑗=1 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑗)𝑝(𝑀𝑗)
.
(7.4)
The marginal likelihood 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚) of each model 𝑀𝑚serves to reweight
the prior probability 𝑝(𝑀𝑚), so that models with higher likelihoods have

7.2. BAYESIAN MODEL UNCERTAINTY
155
larger weights, and models with lower likelihoods receive smaller weights.
We renormalize this weighted prior probability by dividing it by the sum
2𝑝
∑
𝑗=1
𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑗)𝑝(𝑀𝑗) to get the posterior probability of each model.
Recall that the prior odd between two models 𝑀1 and 𝑀2 is defined to be
O[𝑀1 ∶𝑀2] = 𝑝(𝑀1)
𝑝(𝑀2),
and the Bayes factor is defined to be the ratio of the likelihoods of two models
BF[𝑀1 ∶𝑀2] = 𝑝(data | 𝑀1)
𝑝(data | 𝑀2).
Suppose we have chosen a base model 𝑀𝑏, we may divide both the numerator
and the denominator of the formula (7.4) by 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑏) × 𝑝(𝑀𝑏). This gives
us a new formula to calculate the posterior probability of model 𝑀𝑚based on
the prior odd and the Bayes factor. In this new formula, we can see that the
evidence from the data in the Bayes factor BF[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀𝑏], 𝑗= 1, ⋯, 2𝑝serve to
upweight or downweight the prior odd O[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀𝑏], 𝑗= 1, ⋯, 2𝑝.
𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data) =
𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚) × 𝑝(𝑀𝑚)/(𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑏) × 𝑝(𝑀𝑏))
∑
2𝑝
𝑗=1(𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑗) × 𝑝(𝑀𝑗))/(𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑏) × 𝑝(𝑀𝑏))
=
[𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚)/𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑏)] × [𝑝(𝑀𝑚)/𝑝(𝑀𝑏)]
∑
2𝑝
𝑗=1[𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑗)/𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑏)] × [𝑝(𝑀𝑗)/𝑝(𝑀𝑏)]
=
BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀𝑏] × O[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀𝑏]
∑
2𝑝
𝑗=1 BF[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀𝑏] × O[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀𝑏]
.
Any model can be used as the base model 𝑀𝑏. It could be the model with
the highest posterior probability, or the null model 𝑀0 with just the intercept
𝑦𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝜖𝑖.
Using BIC, we can approximate the Bayes factor between two models by their
OLS 𝑅-squared’s and the numbers of predictors used in the models, when we
have large sample of data. This provides a much easier way to approximate
the posterior probability of models since obtaining 𝑅2 can be done by the usual
OLS linear regression. Recall that in Section 7.1, we provided the fact that BIC
of any model 𝑀𝑚(denoted as BIC𝑚) is an asymptotic approximation of the log
of marginal likelihood of 𝑀𝑚when the sample size 𝑛is large (Equation (7.2))
BIC𝑚≈−2 ln(marginal likelihood) = −2 ln(𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚)).

156
CHAPTER 7. BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE
Using this fact, we can approximate Bayes factor between two models by their
BICs
BF[𝑀1 ∶𝑀2] = 𝑝(data | 𝑀1)
𝑝(data | 𝑀2) ≈exp(−BIC1/2)
exp(−BIC2/2) = exp (−1
2(BIC1 −BIC2)) .
We also know that BIC can be calculated by the OLS 𝑅2 and the number of
predictors 𝑝from Equation (7.3) in Section 7.1
BIC = 𝑛ln(1 −𝑅2) + (𝑝+ 1) ln(𝑛) + constant.
(We usually ignore the constant in the last term since it does not affect the
difference betweeen two BICs.)
Using this formula, we can approximate Bayes factor between model 𝑀1 and
𝑀2 by their corresponding 𝑅-squared’s and the numbers of predictors
BF[𝑀1 ∶𝑀2] ≈(1 −𝑅2

As for the null model 𝑀0 ∶𝑦𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝜖𝑖, 𝑅2

BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] = (1 −𝑅2

7.2.2
Calculating Posterior Probability in R
Back to the kid’s cognitive score example, we will see how the summary of results
using bas.lm tells us about the posterior probability of all possible models.
Suppose we have already loaded the data and pre-processed the columns
mom_work and mom_hs using as.numeric function, as what we did in the last
section. To represent model certainty, we construct the probability distribution
overall possible 16 (=24) models where each probability 𝑝(𝑀𝑚) provides a
measure of how likely the model 𝑀𝑚is. Inside the bas.lm function, we first
specify the full model, which in this case is the kid_score, being regressed by
all predictors: mother’s high school status hs, mother’s IQ IQ, mother’s work
status work and mother’s age age. We take the data = cognitive in the next
argument. For the prior distribution of the coeﬀicients for calculating marginal
likelihoods, we use prior = "BIC" to approximate the marginal likelihood
𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚).
We then use modelprior = uniform() in the argument to
assign equal prior probability 𝑝(𝑀𝑚), 𝑚= 1, ⋯, 16 to all 16 models. That is,
𝑝(𝑀𝑚) = 1
16.

Bayesian Model Averaging
In the last section, we explored model uncertainty using posterior probability of
models based on BIC. In this section, we will continue the kid’s cognitive score
example to see how to obtain an Bayesian model averaging results using model
posterior probability.
7.3.1
Visualizing Model Uncertainty
Recall that in the last section, we used the bas.lm function in the BAS package
to obtain posterior probability of all models in the kid’s cognitive score example.
score ∼hq + IQ + work + age
We have found the posterior distribution under model uncertainty using all
possible combinations of the predictors, the mother’s high school status hs,

7.3. BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING
159
mother’s IQ score IQ, whether the mother worked during the first three years
of the kid’s life work, and mother’s age age.
With 4 predictors, there are
24 = 16 possible models. In general, for linear regression model with 𝑝predictor
variables
𝑦𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑥𝑝,𝑖−
̄𝑥) + ⋯+ 𝛽𝑝(𝑥𝑝,𝑖−
̄𝑥𝑝) + 𝜖𝑖,
𝑖= 1, ⋯, 𝑛,
there will be in total 2𝑝possible models.
We can also visualize model uncertainty from the bas object cog_bas that we
generated in the previous section.
In R, the image function may be used to create an image of the model space
that looks like a crossword puzzle.

To obtain a clearer view for model comparison, we did not rotate the image.
Here, the predictors, including the intercept, are on the 𝑦-axis, while the 𝑥-axis
corresponds to each different model. Each vertical column corresponds to one
model. For variables that are not included in one model, they will be represented
by black blocks. For example, model 1 includes the intercept, hs, and IQ, but
not work or age. These models are ordered according to the log of posterior
odd over the null model (model with only the intercept). The log of posterior

160
CHAPTER 7. BAYESIAN MODEL CHOICE
odd is calculated as
ln(PO[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]) = ln(BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] × O[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]).
Since we assing same prior probability for all models, O[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] = 1 and
therefore, the log of posterior odd is the same as the log of the Bayes factor.
The color of each column is proportional to the log of the posterior probability.
Models with same colors have similar posterior probabilities. This allows us to
view models that are clustered together, when the difference within a cluster is
not worth a bare mention.
If we view the image by rows, we can see whether one variable is included in
a particular model. For each variable, there are only 8 models in which it will
appear. For example, we see that IQ appears in all the top 8 models with larger
posterior probabilities, but not the last 8 models. The image function shows up
to 20 models by default.
7.3.2
Bayesian Model Averaging Using Posterior Proba-
bility
Once we have obtained the posterior probability of each model, we can make
inference and obtain weighted averages of quantities of interest using these prob-
abilities as weights. Models with higher posterior probabilities receive higher
weights, while models with lower posterior probabilities receive lower weights.
This gives the name “Bayesian Model Averaging” (BMA). For example, the
probability of the next prediction
̂𝑌∗after seeing the data can be calculated as
a “weighted average” of the prediction of next observation
̂𝑌∗
𝑗under each model
𝑀𝑗, with the posterior probability of 𝑀𝑗being the “weight”
̂𝑌∗=
2𝑝
∑
𝑗=1
̂𝑌∗
𝑗𝑝(𝑀𝑗| data).
In general, we can use this weighted average formula to obtain the value of
a quantity of interest Δ. Δ can 𝑌∗, the next observation; 𝛽𝑗, the coeﬀicient
of variable 𝑋𝑗; 𝑝(𝛽𝑗| data), the posterior probability of 𝛽𝑗after seeing the
data. The posterior probability of Δ seeing the data can be calculated using
the formula
𝑝(Δ | data) =
2𝑝
∑
𝑗=1
𝑝(Δ | 𝑀𝑗, data)𝑝(𝑀𝑗| data).
(7.6)
This formula is similar to the one we have seen in Week 2 lecture Predictive
Inference when we used posterior probability of two different success rates of
getting the head in a coin flip to calculate the predictive probability of getting
heads in future coin flips.
Recall in that example, we have two competing

7.3. BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING
161
hypothese, that the success rate (also known as the probability) of getting heads
in coin flips, are
𝐻1 ∶𝑝= 0.7,
vs
𝐻2 ∶𝑝= 0.4.
We calcualted the posterior probability of each success rate. They are
𝑃(𝑝= 0.7 | data) =𝑃(𝐻1 | data) = 𝑝∗= 0.754,
𝑃(𝑝= 0.4 | data) =𝑃(𝐻2 | data) = 1 −𝑝∗= 0.246.
We can use these two probabilities to calculate the posterior probability of
getting head in the next coin flip
𝑃(head | data) = 𝑃(head | 𝐻1, data)𝑃(𝐻1 | data)+𝑃(head | 𝐻2, data)𝑃(𝐻2 | data).
(7.7)
We can see that equation (7.7) is just a special case of the general equation (7.6)
when the posterior probability of hypotheses 𝑃(𝐻1 | data) and 𝑃(𝐻2 | data)
serve as weights.
Moreover, the expected value of Δ can also be obtained by a weighted average
formula of expected values on each model, using conditional probability
𝐸[Δ | data] =
2𝑝
∑
𝑗=1
𝐸[Δ | 𝑀𝑗, data]𝑝(𝑀𝑗| data).
Since the weights 𝑝(𝑀𝑗| data) are probabilities and have to sum to one, if the
best model had posterior probability one, all of the weights would be placed
on that single best model.
In this case, using BMA would be equivalent to
selecting the best model with the highest posterior probability.
However, if
there are several models that receive substantial probability, they would all be
included in the inference and account for the uncertainty about the true model.

be used for future predictions. The posterior standard deviation se𝛽𝑗provides

̂𝛽𝑗+ critical value × se𝛽𝑗).
However, this only applies if the posterior distribution is symmetric or unimodal.
The posterior mean of the intercept,
̂𝛽0, is obtained after we have centered the
variables.
We have discussed the effect of centering the model.
One of the
advantage of doing so is that the intercept 𝛽0 represents the sample mean of
the observed response 𝑌. Under the reference prior, the point estimate of the
intercept
̂𝛽0 is exactly the mean
̄𝑌.
We see that the posterior mean, standard deviation and inclusion probability
are slightly different than the ones we obtained in Section 6.3 when we forced
the model to include all variables.
Under BMA, IQ has posterior inclusion
probability 1, suggesting that it is very likely that IQ should be included in
the model. hs also has a high posterior inclusion probability of about 0.61.
However, the posterior inclusion probability of mother’s work status work and
mother’s age age are relatively small compared to IQ and hs.
We can also plot the posterior distributions of these coeﬀicients to take a closer
look at the distributions
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(cog_coef, subset = c(2:5))

This plot agrees with the summary table we obtained above, which shows that
the posterior probability distributions of work and age have a very large point
mass at 0, while the distribution of hs has a relatively small mass at 0. There is
a slighly little tip at 0 for the variable IQ, indicating that the posterior inclusion
probability of IQ is not exactly 1. However, since the probability mass for IQ
to be 0 is so small, that we are almost certain that IQ should be included under
Bayesian model averaging.

Summary
In this chapter, we have discussed Bayesian model uncertainty and Bayesian
model averaging. We have shown how Bayesian model averaging can be used
to address model uncertainty using the ensemble of models for inference, rather
than selecting a single model.
We applied this to the kid’s cognitive score
data set using BAS package in R. Here we illustrated the concepts using BIC
and reference prior on the coeﬀicients.
In the next chapter, we will explore
alternative priors for coeﬀicients, taking into account the sensitivity of model
selection to prior choices.
We will also explore Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm for model sampling when the model space is too large for theoretical
calculations.

Stochastic Explorations
Using MCMC
In this chapter, we will discuss stochastic explorations of the model space using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. This is particularly usefull when the num-
ber of models in the model space is relatively large. We will introduce the idea
and the algorithm that we apply on the kid’s cognitive score example. Then We
will introduce some alternative priors for the coeﬀicients other than the reference
priors that we have been focused on. We will demonstrate using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo on the crime data set to see how to use this stochastic method to
explore the model space and how different priors may lead to different posterior
inclusion probability of coeﬀicients. Finally, we will summarize decision making
strategies under Bayesian model uncertainty.
8.1
Stochastic Exploration
In the last chapter, we explored model uncertainty using posterior probability
of each model and Bayesian model averaging based on BIC. We applied the
idea on the kid’s cognitive score data set. With 4 predictors, we had 24 = 16
possible models. Since the total number of models is relatively small, it is easy
to enumerate all possible models to obtain Bayesian model averaging results.
However, in general we often have data sets with large number of variables,
which may lead to long computating time via enumeration. In this section, we
will present one of the common stochastic methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC), to explore model spaces and implement Bayesian model averaging to
estimate quantities of interest.

CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
8.1.1
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Exploration
Let us assume that we have a pseudo population of possible models that we
obtained from all the possible combinations of regression models from the kid’s
cognitive score example. We prepare the data set as in Section 6.3 and run
bas.lm to obtain posterior probability of each model as we did in Section 7.2.

# Run regression

We will use this example to explore the idea of MCMC and generalize it to re-
gression models with much larger model spaces. To explore the models, we may
arrange them by their model sizes, the number of predictors plus the intercept,
on the 𝑥-axis, and their posterior probabilities on the 𝑦-axis.

We could then take a sample from this population of models with replacement
(therefore, some models may be selected more than once in this sample). This
process could be done using the sample function in R. We hope that the fre-
quency of appearance of a model would be a good approximation of the posterior
probability of this model. We use 𝐼(𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚) as the indicator function to in-
dicate that the current model 𝑀𝑗we sample is the model of interest 𝑀𝑚, that
is
𝐼(𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚) = { 1,
if 𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚
0,
if 𝑀𝑗≠𝑀𝑚
Suppose we are going to sample 𝐽models in total, we hope that
𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data) ≈
∑
𝐽
𝑗=1 𝐼(𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚)
𝐽
=
𝐽
∑
𝑗=1
𝐼(𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚)
𝐽
.
(8.1)
After all, we would not need to calculate the model posterior probability
𝑃(𝑀𝑚| data).
The quantity from the sampling
𝐽
∑
𝑗=1
𝐼(𝑀𝑗= 𝑀𝑚)
𝐽
would
provide a good approximation, which only requires simple counting.
In order to ensure that we would sample models with a probability that is equal
to their posterior probability, or in a simpler way, proportional to the marginal
likelihood times the prior probability 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚)×𝑝(𝑀𝑚), we need to design a
sampling method that replaces old models with new models when the posterior
probability goes up, and keeps the old models when the posterior probability is
not improved.
Here, we propose the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We start with an initial
model 𝑀(0). This could be any model we like in the model space. We start
iterating over the entire model space, randomly pick the next model 𝑀∗(1) and
see whether this model improves the posterior probability. We use the notation

168
CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
𝑀∗(1) instead of 𝑀(1) because we are not sure whether we should include this
model in our final sample, or we should consider other models. Therefore, we
calculate the ratio between the posterior probability of the two models, the
original model 𝑀(0), and the proposed model 𝑀∗(1), which turns out to be the
posterior odd between the two models
𝑅= 𝑝(𝑀∗(1) | data)
𝑝(𝑀(0) | data) = PO[𝑀∗(1) ∶𝑀(0)].
Our goal is to avoid actually calculating the posterior probability of each model,
so we instead would compute 𝑅using the Bayes factor and the prior odd of the
two models.
𝑅= 𝑝(𝑀∗(1) | data)
𝑝(𝑀(0) | data) = PO[𝑀∗(1) ∶𝑀(0)] = BF[𝑀∗(1) ∶𝑀(0)] × O[𝑀∗(1) ∶𝑀(0)].
If 𝑅≥1, that means 𝑀∗(1) will surely improve the posterior probability after
seeing the data compared to 𝑀(0). So we would like to include 𝑀∗(1) into our
sample, because 𝑀∗(1) deserves more occurrence. In this case, we set 𝑀∗(1) to
be 𝑀(1), indicating that it is part of our final sample. However, if 𝑅< 1, we are
not that sure whether 𝑀∗(1) should be in the sample. But we also do not want
to only include models with higher posterior probabilities. Remember that the
purpose of this algorithm is to reproduce the frequency of model occurance in
the final sample so that the relative frequency of occurrence of each model could
be a good proxy of its posterior probability. Even though the proposed model
𝑀∗(1) has lower posterior probability, we should still have some representatives
of this model in our final sample. Hence we set 𝑀∗(1) to be 𝑀(1) with probability
𝑅, reflecting the chance that this model would be in our sample is 𝑅.
To include 𝑀∗(1) in the final sample with probability 𝑅, we may use a random
number generator to generate number between 0 and 1 and see whether this
number is larger than 𝑅. Or we may set a coin flip with heads showing up
with probability 𝑅. If the random number is larger than 𝑅, or the head shows
up using the biased coin, we include this model. Otherwise, we neglect this
proposed model and keep on selecting the next model.
Once the first model 𝑀∗(1)) is sampled, we move onto the second model 𝑀(2)
with the same process.
In general, after we have obtained model 𝑀(𝑖), we
propose a model 𝑀∗(𝑖+1) and calculate the ratio of the posterior probabilities of
the two models
𝑅= 𝑝(𝑀∗(𝑖+1) | data)
𝑝(𝑀(𝑖) | data)
= BF[𝑀∗(𝑖+1) ∶𝑀(𝑖)] × O[𝑀∗(𝑖+1) ∶𝑀(𝑖)].
If 𝑅≥1, we unconditionally accept 𝑀∗(𝑖+1) to be our next model 𝑀(𝑖).
If
𝑅< 1, we accept 𝑀∗(𝑖+1) to be 𝑀(𝑖) with probability 𝑅.

8.2. OTHER PRIORS FOR BAYESIAN MODEL UNCERTAINTY
169
After obtaining 𝐽models, 𝑀(1), 𝑀(2), ⋯, 𝑀(𝐽), we can count how many models
inside this sample is 𝑀𝑚, the model we are interested. Then we use the formula
(8.1) to approximate the posterior probability of 𝑀𝑚. These estimated proba-
bilities can be used in model selection or BMA instead of the exact expressions.
We propose model randomly in the above algorithm, i.e., all models are equally
likely to be proposed. This can be pretty ineﬀicient if there are lots of models
with low probabilities. We may come up with other ways to propose models.
For example, we may look at neighboring models of our current model by either
adding one predictor that is currently not in the model, or randomly dropping
one of the current predictors from the model. We may flip a fair coin to decide
whether to add or to drop. This forms a random walk across neighboring models.
We may also propose to swap out a current predictor with one that is currently
not in the model, which maintains the size of the model. This has the potential
to take bigger jumps in the model space. There are other possible moves that
can be designed to help move around over the model space. However, we have to
be careful to adjust for any potential bias, due to how we propose new models,
to ensure that the relative frequency eventually would converge to the posterior
probability.
In the lecture video, we have demonstrated the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method on the kid’s cognitive score using animation to show how
each model was proposed and finally selected.
8.2
Other Priors for Bayesian Model Uncer-
tainty
So far, we have discussed Bayesian model selection and Bayesian model aver-
aging using BIC. BIC is an asymptotic approximation of the log of marginal
likelihood of models when the number of data points is large. Under BIC, prior
distribution of 𝛽= (𝛽0, 𝛽1, ⋯, 𝛽𝑝)𝑇is uniformaly flat, which is the same as
applying the reference prior on 𝛽conditioning on 𝜎2. In this section, we will
introduce a new conjugate prior distribution, called the Zellner’s 𝑔-prior. We
will see that this prior leads to simple expressions for the Bayes factor, in terms
of summary statistics from ordinary least square (OLS). We will talk about
choosing the parameter 𝑔in the prior and conduct a sensitivity analysis, using
the kid’s cognitive score data that we used in earlier sections.
8.2.1
Zellner’s 𝑔-Prior
To analyze the model more conveniently, we still stick with the “centered” re-
gression model. Let 𝑦1, ⋯, 𝑦𝑛to be the observations of the response variable 𝑌.
The multiple regression model is
𝑦𝑖= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑥1,𝑖−
̄𝑥1) + 𝛽2(𝑥2,𝑖−
̄𝑥2) + ⋯+ 𝛽𝑝(𝑥𝑝,𝑖−
̄𝑥𝑝) + 𝜖𝑖,
1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛.

170
CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
As before,
̄𝑥1, ⋯, ̄𝑥𝑝, are the sample means of the variables 𝑋1, ⋯, 𝑋𝑝. Since
we have centered all the variables, 𝛽0 is no longer the 𝑦-intercept. Instead, it
is the sample mean of 𝑌when taking 𝑋1 =
̄𝑥1, ⋯, 𝑋𝑝=
̄𝑥𝑝.
𝛽1, ⋯, 𝛽𝑝are
the coeﬀicients for the 𝑝variables. 𝛽= (𝛽0, 𝛽1, ⋯, 𝛽𝑝)𝑇is the vector notation
representing all coeﬀicients, including 𝛽0.
Under this model, we assume
𝑦𝑖| 𝛽, 𝜎2
iid
∼Normal(𝛽0 + 𝛽1(𝑥1,𝑖−
̄𝑥1) + ⋯+ 𝛽𝑝(𝑥𝑝,𝑖−
̄𝑥𝑝), 𝜎2),
which is equivalent to
𝜖𝑖| 𝛽, 𝜎2
iid
∼Normal(0, 𝜎2).
We then specify the prior distributions for 𝛽𝑗, 0 ≤𝑗≤𝑝. Zellner proposed a
simple informative conjugate multivariate normal prior for 𝛽conditioning on 𝜎2
as
𝛽| 𝜎2 ∼Normal(𝑏0, Σ = 𝑔𝜎2S−1
xx).
Here
Sxx = (X −
̄X)𝑇(X −
̄X),
where the matrix X −
̄X is
X−̄X = ⎛

.
When 𝑝= 1, this Sxx simplifies to Sxx =
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
(𝑥𝑖−𝑏𝑎𝑟𝑥)2, the sum of squares
of a single variable 𝑋that we used in Section 6.1. In multiple regression, Sxx
provides the variance and covariance for OLS.
The parameter 𝑔scales the prior variance of 𝛽, over the OLS variances 𝜎2S−1
xx.
One of the advantages of using this prior is ,that it reduces prior elicitation
down to two components; the prior mean 𝑏0 and the scalar 𝑔. We use 𝑔to
control the size of the variance of the prior, rather than set separate priors for
all the variances and covariances (there would be 𝑝(𝑝+ 1)/2 such priors for a
𝑝+ 1 dimensional multivariate normal distribution).
Another advantage of using Zellner’s 𝑔-prior is that it leads to simple updating
rules, like all conjugate priors.
Moreover, the posterior mean and posterior
variance have simple forms. The posterior mean is
𝑔
1 + 𝑔
̂𝛽+
1
1 + 𝑔𝑏0,

8.2. OTHER PRIORS FOR BAYESIAN MODEL UNCERTAINTY
171
where
̂𝛽is the frequentist OLS estimates of coeﬀicients 𝛽. The posterior variance
is
𝑔
1 + 𝑔𝜎2S−1
xx.
From the posterior mean formula, we can see that the posterior mean is a
weighted average of the prior mean 𝑏0 and the OLS estimate
̂𝛽. Since
𝑔
1 + 𝑔is
strictly less than 1, Zellner’s 𝑔-prior shrinks the OLS estimates
̂𝛽towards the
prior mean 𝑏0. As 𝑔→∞,
𝑔
1 + 𝑔→1 and
1
1 + 𝑔→0, and we recover the OLS
estimate as in the reference prior.
Similarly, the posterior variancc is a shrunken version of the OLS variance, by a
factor of
𝑔
1 + 𝑔. The posterior distribution of 𝛽conditioning on 𝜎2 is a normal
distribution
𝛽| 𝜎2, data ∼Normal(
𝑔
1 + 𝑔
̂𝛽+
1
1 + 𝑔𝑏0,
𝑔
1 + 𝑔𝜎2S−1
xx).
8.2.2
Bayes Factor of Zellner’s 𝑔-Prior
Because of this simplicity, Zellner’s 𝑔-prior has been widely used in Bayesian
model selection and Bayesian model averaging. One of the most popular versions
uses the 𝑔-prior for all coeﬀicients except the intercept, and takes the prior
mean to be the zero vector 𝑏0 = 0. If we are not testing any hypotheses about
the intercept 𝛽0, we may combine this 𝑔-prior with the reference prior for the
intercept 𝛽0 and 𝜎2, that is, we set
𝑝(𝛽0, 𝜎2) ∝1
𝜎2 ,
and use the 𝑔-prior for the rest of the coeﬀicients (𝛽1, ⋯, 𝛽𝑝)𝑇.
Under this prior, the Bayes factor for comparing model 𝑀𝑚to the null model
𝑀0, which only has the intercept, is simply
BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] = (1 + 𝑔)(𝑛−𝑝𝑚−1)/2(1 + 𝑔(1 −𝑅2
𝑚))−(𝑛−1)/2.
Here 𝑝𝑚is the number of predictors in 𝑀𝑚, 𝑅2
𝑚is the 𝑅-squared of model 𝑀𝑚.
With the Bayes factor, we can compare any two models using posterior odds.
For example, we can compare model 𝑀𝑚with the null model 𝑀0 by
𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data, 𝑔)
𝑝(𝑀0 | data, 𝑔) = PO[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] = BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]𝑝(𝑀𝑚)
𝑝(𝑀0) .
Now the question is, how do we pick 𝑔?
As we see that, the Bayes factor
depends on 𝑔. If 𝑔→∞, BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0] →0. This provides overwhelming

172
CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
evidence against model 𝑀𝑚, no matter how many predictors we pick for 𝑀𝑚
and the data. This is the Bartlett’s/Jeffrey-Lindley’s paradox.
On the other hand, if we use any arbitrary fixed value of 𝑔, and include more
and more predictors, the 𝑅-squared 𝑅2
𝑚will get closer and closer to 1, but
the Bayes factor will remain bounded.
With 𝑅2
𝑚getting larger and larger,
we would expect the alternative model 𝑀𝑚would be supported. However, a
bounded Bayes factor would not provide overwhelming support for 𝑀𝑚, even in
the frequentist approach we are getting better and better fit for the data. This is
the information paradox, when the Bayes factor comes to a different conclusion
from the frequentist approach due to the boundedness of Bayes factor in the
limiting case.
There are some solutions which appear to lead to reasonable results in small and
large samples based on empirical results with real data to theory, and provide
resolution to these two paradoxes. In the following examples, we let the prior
distribution of 𝑔depend on 𝑛, the size of the data. Since Sxx is getting larger
with larger 𝑛, 𝑔𝜎2S−1
xx may get balanced if 𝑔also grows relatively to the size of
𝑛.
Unit Information Prior
In the case of the unit information prior, we let 𝑔= 𝑛. This is the same as
saying 𝑛
𝑔= 1. In this prior, we will only need to specify the prior mean 𝑏0 for
the coeﬀicients of the predicor variables (𝛽1, ⋯, 𝛽𝑝)𝑇.
Zellner-Siow Cauchly Prior
However, taking 𝑔= 𝑛ignores the uncertainty of the choice of 𝑔. Since we do
not know 𝑔a priori, we may pick a prior so that the expected value of 𝑛
𝑔= 1.
One exmaple is the Zellner-Siow cauchy prior. In this prior, we let
𝑛
𝑔
∼Gamma(1
2, 1
2).
Hyper-𝑔/𝑛Prior
Another example is to set
1
1 + 𝑛/𝑔∼Beta(𝑎
2, 𝑏
2),
with hyperparameters 𝑎and 𝑏. Since the Bayes factor under this prior distri-
bution can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, this is called the
hyper-𝑔/𝑛prior.
8.2.3
Kid’s Cognitive Score Example
We apply these priors on the kid’s cognitive score example and compare the
posterior probability that each coeﬀicient 𝛽𝑖, 𝑖= 1, 2, 3, 4 to be non-zero. We

first read in data and store the size of the data into 𝑛. We will use this 𝑛later,
when setting priors for 𝑛/𝑔.

We then fit the full model using different priors. Here we set model prior to be

Here cog.g is the model corresponding to the unit information prior 𝑔= 𝑛.
cog.ZS is the model under the Zellner-Siow cauchy prior with Jeffrey’s reference
prior on 𝜎2. cog.HG gives the model under the hyper-𝑔/𝑛prior. cog.EB is the
empirical Bayesian estimates which maximizes the marginal likelihood. cog.BIC
and cog.AIC are the ones corresponding to using BIC and AIC for marginal

In order to compare the posterior inclusion probability (pip) of each coeﬀicient,
we group the results 𝑝(𝛽𝑖≠0) obtained from the probne0 attribute of each
model for later comparison

We can see that mother’s IQ score is included almost as probability 1 in all
priors. So all methods agree that we should include variable IQ. Mother’s high
school status also has probability of more than 0.5 in each prior, suggesting
that we may also consider including the variable hs. However, mother’s work
status and mother’s age have much lower posterior inclusion probability in all
priors. From left to right in each bar plot, we see that method BIC is the most
conservative method (meaning it will exclude the most variables), while AIC is
being the less conservative method.

However, these variables have been pre-processed for modeling purpose, so the
summary statistics may not be so meaningful. The values of all these variables
have been aggregated over each state, so this is a case of ecological regression.
We will not model directly the rate for a person to commit a crime. Instead,
we will use the total number of crimes and average values of predictors at the
state level to predict the total crime rate of each state.
We transform the variables using the natural log function, except the indicator
variable So (2nd column of the data set). We perform this transformation based
on the analysis of this data set.1 Notice that So is already a numeric variable (1
indicating Southern state and 0 otherwise), not as a categorical variable. Hence
we do not need any data processing of this variable, unlike mother’s high school
status hs and mother’s work status work in the kid’s cognitive score data set.
UScrime[,-2] = log(UScrime[,-2])
8.3.2
Bayesian Models and Diagnostics
We run bas.lm function from the BAS package. We first run the full model and
use this information for later decision on what variables to include. Here we
have 15 potential predictors. The total number of models is 215 = 32768. This
is not a very large number and BAS can enumerate all the models pretty quickly.
However, we want to illustrate how to explore models using stochastic methods.
Hence we set argument method = MCMC inside the bas.lm function. We also
use the Zellner-Siow cauchy prior for the prior distributions of the coeﬀicients
in this regression.
library(BAS)
crime.ZS =
bas.lm(y ~ ., data=UScrime,
prior="ZS-null", modelprior=uniform(), method = "MCMC")
1More details can be found in Venables and Ripley (2013).

178
CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
BAS will run the MCMC sampler until the number of unique models in the
sample exceeds number of models = 2𝑝(when 𝑝< 19) or until the number of
MCMC iterations exceeds 2×number of models by default, whichever is smaller.
Here 𝑝is the number of predictors.
Diagnostic Plots
To analyze the result, we first look at the diagnostic plot using diagnostics
function and see whether we have run the MCMC exploration long enough so
that the posterior inclusion probability (pip) has converged.

pip (renormalized)
pip (MCMC)
In this plot, the 𝑥-axis is the renormalized posterior inclusion probability (pip)
of each coeﬀicient 𝛽𝑖, 𝑖= 1, ⋯, 15 in this model. This can be calculated as
𝑝(𝛽𝑖≠0 | data) =
∑
𝑀𝑚∈model space
𝐼(𝑋𝑖∈𝑀𝑚)

⎞

⎟
⎠
.
(8.2)
Here, 𝑋𝑖is the 𝑖th predictor variable, and 𝐼(𝑋𝑖∈𝑀𝑚) is the indicator function
which is 1 if 𝑋𝑖is included in model 𝑀𝑚and 0 if 𝑋𝑖is not included. The first
Σ notation indicates that we sum over all models 𝑀𝑚in the model space. And
we use
BF[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]O[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]
∑
𝑀𝑗
BF[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀0]O[𝑀𝑗∶𝑀0]
(8.3)
as the weights. You may recognize that the numerator of (8.3) is exactly the
ratio of the posterior probability of model 𝑀𝑚over the posterior probability of
the null model 𝑀0, i.e., the posterier odd PO[𝑀𝑚∶𝑀0]. We devide the posterior

8.3. R DEMO ON BAS PACKAGE
179
odd by the total sum of posterior odds of all models in the model space, to make
sure these weights are between 0 and 1. The weight in Equation (8.3) represents
the posterior probability of the model 𝑀𝑚after seeing the data 𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data),
the one we used in Section 7.2. So Equation (8.2) is the theoretical calculation
of pip, which can be rewrited as
𝑝(𝛽𝑖≠0 | data) =
∑
𝑀𝑚∈model space
𝐼(𝑋𝑖∈𝑀𝑚)𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data).
The null model 𝑀0, as we recall, is the model that only includes the intercept.
On the 𝑦-axis of the plot, we lay out the posterior inclusion probability of
coeﬀicient 𝛽𝑖, which is calculated using
𝑝(𝛽𝑖≠0 | data) = 1
𝐽
𝐽
∑
𝑗=1
𝐼(𝑋𝑖∈𝑀(𝑗)).
Here 𝐽is the total number of models that we sample using MCMC; each model is
denoted as 𝑀(𝑗) (some models may repeat themselves in the sample). We count
the frequency of variable 𝑋𝑖occuring in model 𝑀(𝑗), and divide this number by
the total number of models 𝐽. This is a frequentist approach to approximate
the posterior probability of including 𝑋𝑖after seeing the data.
When all points are on the 45 degree diagonal, we say that the posterior inclusion
probability of each variable from MCMC have converged well enough to the
theoretical posterior inclusion probability.
We can also use diagnostics function to see whether the model posterior prob-
ability has converged:

p(M | Y) (renormalized)
p(M | Y) (MCMC)
We can see that some of the points still fall slightly away from the 45 degree
diagonal line.
This may suggest we should increase the number of MCMC
iterations. We may do that by imposing the argument on MCMC.iterations
inside the bas.lm function

180
CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
# Re-run regression using larger number of MCMC iterations
crime.ZS = bas.lm(y ~ ., data = UScrime,

With more number of iterations, we see that most points stay in the 45 de-

We will next look at four other plots of the BAS object, crime.ZS.
Residuals Versus Fitted Values Using BMA
The first plot is the residuals over the fitted value under Bayesian model aver-
aging results.

ask = F, pch = 16, sub.caption="", caption="")

Cumulative Probability
We can see that after we have discovered about 5,000 unique models with MCMC
sampling, the probability is starting to level off, indicating that these additional
models have very small probability and do not contribute substantially to the
posterior distribution. These probabilities are proportional to the product of
marginal likelihoods of models and priors, 𝑝(data | 𝑀𝑚)𝑝(𝑀𝑚), rather than
Monte Carlo frequencies.
Model Complexity
The third plot is the model size versus the natural log of the marginal likelihood,
or the Bayes factor, to compare each model to the null model.

We see that the models with the highest Bayes factors or logs of marginal
likelihoods have around 8 or 9 predictors. The null model has a log of marginal
likelihood of 0, or a Bayes factor of 1.

Finally, we have a plot showing the importance of different predictors.

The lines in blue correspond to the variables where the marginal posterior in-
clusion probability (pip), is greater than 0.5, suggesting that these variables are
important for prediction. The variables represented in grey lines have posterior
inclusion probability less than 0.5. Small posterior inclusion probability may
arise when two or more variables are highly correlated, similar to large 𝑝-values
with multicollinearity. So we should be cautious to use these posterior inclusion
probabilities to eliminate variables.
Model Space Visualization
To focus on the high posterior probability models, we can look at the image of
the model space.

By default, we only include the top 20 models. An interesting feature of this
plot is, that whenever Po1, the police expenditures in 1960, is included, Po2, the
police expenditures in 1959, will be excluded from the model, and vice versa.

Calculating the correlation between the two variables, we see that that Po1 and
Po2 are highly correlated with positive correlation 0.993.
8.3.3
Posterior Uncertainty in Coeﬀicients
Due to the interesting inclusion relationship between Po1 and Po2 in the top
20 models, we extract the two coeﬀicients under Bayesian model averaging and
take a look at the plots for the coeﬀicients for Po1 and Po2.

Po2
Under Bayesian model averaging, there is more mass at 0 for Po2 than Po1,
giving more posterior inclusion probability for Po1. This is also the reason why
in the marginal posterior plot of variable importance, Po1 has a blue line while
Po2 has a grey line. When Po1 is excluded, the distributions of other coeﬀicients
in the model, except the one for Po2, will have similar distributions as when both
Po1 and Po2 are in the model. However, when both predictors are included, the
adjusted coeﬀicient for Po2 has more support on negative values, since we are
over compensating for having both variables included in the model. In extreme
cases of correlations, one may find that the coeﬀicient plot is multimodal. If this
is the case, the posterior mean may not be in the highest probability density
credible interval, and this mean is not necessarily an informative summary. We
will discuss more in the next section about making decisions on highly correlated
variables.
We can read the credible intervals of each variable using the confint function
on the coeﬀicient object coef.ZS of the model. Here we round the results in 4
decimal places.

Prediction
We can use the usual predict function that we used for lm objects to obtain
prediction from the BAS object crime.ZS. However, since we have different mod-
els to choose from under the Bayesian framework, we need to first specify which
particular model we use to obtain the prediction. For example, if we would like
to use the Bayesian model averaging results for coeﬀicients to obtain predic-
tions, we would specify the estimator argument in the predict function like
the following
crime.BMA = predict(crime.ZS, estimator = "BMA", se.fit = TRUE)
The fitted values can be obtained using the fit attribute of crime.BMA. We
have transposed the fitted values into a vector to better present all the values.

CHAPTER 8. STOCHASTIC EXPLORATIONS USING MCMC
8.4
Decision Making Under Model Uncertainty
We are closing this chapter by presenting the last topic, decision making un-
der model uncertainty. We have seen that under the Bayesian framework, we
can use different prior distributions for coeﬀicients, different model priors for
models, and we can even use stochastic exploration methods for complex model
selections. After selecting these coeﬀicient priors and model priors, we can ob-
tain the marginal posterior inclusion probability for each variable in the full
model, which may provide some information about whether or not to include
a particular variable in the model for further model analysis and predictions.
With all the information presented in the results, which model would be the
most appropriate model?
In this section, we will talk about different methods for selecting models and
decision making for posterior distributions and predictions. We will illustrate
this process using the US crime data UScrime as an example and process it
using the BAS package.
We first prepare the data as in the last section and run bas.lm on the full model
data(UScrime, package="MASS")
# take the natural log transform on the variables except the 2nd column `So`
UScrime[, -2] = log(UScrime[, -2])
# run Bayesian linear regression
library(BAS)
crime.ZS =
bas.lm(y ~ ., data = UScrime,
prior = "ZS-null", modelprior = uniform())
8.4.1
Model Choice
For Bayesian model choice, we start with the full model, which includes all the
predictors. The uncertainty of selecting variables, or model uncertainty that
we have been discussing, arises when we believe that some of the explanatory
variables may be unrelated to the response variable. This corresponds to setting
a regression coeﬀicient 𝛽𝑗to be exactly zero. We specify prior distributions that
reflect our uncertainty about the importance of variables. We then update the
model based on the data we obtained, resulting in posterior distributions over
all models and the coeﬀicients and variances within each model.
Now the question has become, how to select a single model from the posterior
distribution and use it for furture inference?
What are the objectives from
inference?
BMA Model
We do have a single model, the one that is obtained by averaging all models using
their posterior probabilities, the Bayesian model averaging model, or BMA. This

8.4. DECISION MAKING UNDER MODEL UNCERTAINTY
187
is referred to as a hierarchical model and it is composed of many simpler models
as building blocks. This represents the full posterior uncertainty after seeing
the data.
We can obtain the posterior predictive mean by using the weighted average of
all of the predictions from each sub model
̂𝜇= 𝐸[ ̂𝑌| data] =
∑
𝑀𝑚∈model space
̂𝑌× 𝑝(𝑀𝑚| data).
This prediction is the best under the squared error loss 𝐿2.
From BAS, we
can obtain predictions and fitted values using the usual predict and fitted
functions. To specify which model we use for these results, we need to include
argument estimator.
crime.BMA = predict(crime.ZS, estimator = "BMA")
mu_hat = fitted(crime.ZS, estimator = "BMA")
crime.BMA, the object obtained by the predict function, has additional slots
storing results from the BMA model.

Highest Probability Model
If our objective is to learn what is the most likely model to have generated the
data using a 0-1 loss 𝐿0, then the highest probability model (HPM) is optimal.
crime.HPM = predict(crime.ZS, estimator = "HPM")
The variables selected from this model can be obtained using the bestmodel
attribute from the crime.HPM object. We extract the variable names from the
crime.HPM
crime.HPM$best.vars
## [1] "Intercept" "M"
"Ed"
"Po1"
"NW"
"U2"
## [7] "Ineq"
"Prob"
"Time"
We see that, except the intercept, which is always in any models, the highest
probability model also includes M, percentage of males aged 14-24; Ed, mean
years of schooling; Po1, police expenditures in 1960; NW, number of non-whites
per 1000 people; U2, unemployment rate of urban males aged 35-39; Ineq, in-
come inequlity; Prob, probability of imprisonment, and Time, average time in
state prison.
To obtain the coeﬀicients and their posterior means and posterior standard
deviations, we tell give an optional argument to coef to indicate that we want
to extract coeﬀicients under the HPM.

We can also obtain the posterior probability of this model using

postprob.HPM
## [1] 0.01824728
we see that this highest probability model has posterior probability of only
0.018. There are many models that have comparable posterior probabilities. So
even this model has the highest posterior probability, we are still pretty unsure
about whether it is the best model.
Median Probability Model
Another model that is frequently reported, is the median probability model
(MPM). This model includes all predictors whose marginal posterior inclusion
probabilities are greater than 0.5.
If the variables are all uncorrelated, this
will be the same as the highest posterior probability model. For a sequence of
nested models such as polynomial regression with increasing powers, the median
probability model is the best single model for prediction.
However, since in the US crime example, Po1 and Po2 are highly correlated, we
see that the variables included in MPM are slightly different than the variables
included in HPM.
crime.MPM = predict(crime.ZS, estimator = "MPM")
crime.MPM$best.vars

As we see, this model only includes 7 variables, M, Ed, Po1, NW, U2, Ineq, and
Prob. It does not include Time variable as in HPM.
When there are correlated predictors in non-nested models, MPM in general
does well. However, if the correlations among variables increase, MPM may
miss important variables as the correlations tend to dilute the posterior inclusing
probabilities of related variables.
To obtain the coeﬀicients in the median probability model, we specify that the
estimator is now “MPM”:

Best Predictive Model
If our objective is prediction from a single model, the best choice is to find the
model whose predictions are closest to those given by BMA. “Closest” could
be based on squared error loss for predictions, or be based on any other loss
functions. Unfortunately, there is no nice expression for this model. However,
we can still calculate the loss for each of our sampled models to try to identify
this best predictive model, or BPM.

8.4. DECISION MAKING UNDER MODEL UNCERTAINTY

Using the squared error loss, we find that the best predictive model is the one
whose predictions are closest to BMA.

The best predictive model includes not only the 7 variables that MPM includes,
but also M.F, number of males per 1000 females, and Po2, the police expenditures
in 1959.
Using the se.fit = TRUE option with predict we can calculate standard de-
viations for the predictions or for the mean. Then we can use this as input for
the confint function for the prediction object. Here we only show the results
of the first 20 data points.

crime.BPM.conf.fit = confint(crime.BPM, parm = "mean")

The option estimator = "BPM is not yet available in coef(), so we will need to
work a little harder to get the coeﬀicients by refitting the BPM. First we need
to extract a vector of zeros and ones representing which variables are included

Next, we will refit the model with bas.lm using the optional argument
bestmodel = BPM. In general, this is the starting model for the stochastic
search, which is helpful for starting the MCMC. We will also specify that want
to have 1 model by setting n.models = 1. In this way, bas.lm starts with the
BPM and fits only that model.
# Re-run regression and specify `bestmodel` and `n.models`
crime.ZS.BPM = bas.lm(y ~ ., data = UScrime,
prior = "ZS-null",
modelprior = uniform(),
bestmodel = BPM, n.models = 1)
Now since we have only one model in our new object representing the BPM, we
can use the coef function to obtain the summaries.

From the above paired correlation plots, we see that the correlations among
them are extremely high. As expected, the single best predictive model (BPM)
has the highest correlation with MPM, with a correlation of 0.998. However,
the highest posterior model (HPM) and the Bayesian model averaging model
(BMA) are nearly equally as good.

Prediction with New Data
Using the newdata option in the predict function, we can obtain prediction
from a new data set. Here we pretend that UScrime is an another new data set,
and we use BMA to obtain the prediction of new observations. Here we only
show the results of the first 20 data points.

Summary
In this chapter, we have introduced one of the common stochastic exploration
methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to explore the model space to obtain
approximation of posterior probability of each model when the model space
is too large for theoretical enumeration. We see that model selection can be
sensitive to the prior distributions of coeﬀicients, and introduced Zellner’s 𝑔-
prior so that we have to elicit only one hyper-parameter to specify the prior.
Still model selection can be sensitive to the choice of 𝑔where values that are
too large may unintentially lead to the null model receiving high probability in
Bartlett’s paradox. To resolve this and other paradoxes related to the choice
of 𝑔, we recommend default choices that have improved robustness to prior
misspecification such as the unit information 𝑔-prior, the Zellner-Siow Cauchy
prior, and the hyper-𝑔/𝑛prior.

8.5. SUMMARY
195
We then demonstrated a multiple linear regression process using the BAS package
and the US crime data UScrime using the Zellner-Siow cauchy prior, and have
tried to understand the importance of variables. Finally, we have compared the
prediction results from different models, such as the ones from Bayesian model
average (BMA), the highest probability model (HPM), the median probability
model (MPM), and the best predictive model (BPM). For the comparison, we
have used the Zellner-Siow Cauchy prior. But of course there is not one single
best prior that is the best overall.
If you do have prior information about
a variable, you should include it.
If you expect that there should be many
predictors related to the response variable 𝑌, but that each has a small effect,
an alternate prior may be better. Also, think critically about whether model
selection is important. If you believe that all the variables should be relevant
but are worried about over fitting, there are alternative priors that will avoid
putting probabilities on coeﬀicients that are exactly zero and will still prevent
over fitting by shrinkage of coeﬀicients to prior means. Examples include the
Bayesian lasso or Bayesian horseshoe.
There are other forms of model uncertainty that you may want to consider, such
as linearity in the relationship between the predictors and the response, uncer-
tainty about the presence of outliers, and uncertainty about the distribution of
the response. These forms of uncertainty can be incorporated by expanding the
models and priors similar to what we have covered here.
Multiple linear regression is one of the most widely used statistical methods,
however, this is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with Bayesian
methods.
