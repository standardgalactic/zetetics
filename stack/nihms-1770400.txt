Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Fundamental circuit features of the mouse visual system emerge before the 
onset of vision, allowing the mouse to perceive objects and detect visual motion immediately 
upon eye opening. How the mouse visual system achieves self-organization by the time of eye 
opening without structured external sensory input is not well understood. In the absence of sensory 
drive, the developing retina generates spontaneous activity in the form of propagating waves. Past 
work has shown that spontaneous retinal waves provide the correlated activity necessary to refine 
the development of gross topographic maps in downstream visual areas, such as retinotopy and 
eye-specific segregation, but it is unclear whether waves also convey information that instructs 
the development of higher-order visual response properties, such as direction selectivity, at eye 
opening.
RATIONALE: Spontaneous retinal waves exhibit stereotyped changing spatiotemporal patterns 
throughout development. To characterize the spatiotemporal properties of waves during 
development, we used one-photon wide-field calcium imaging of retinal axons projecting to 
the superior colliculus in awake neonatal mice. We identified a consistent propagation bias that 
occurred during a transient developmental window shortly before eye opening. Using quantitative 
analysis, we investigated whether the directionally biased retinal waves conveyed ethological 
information relevant to future visual inputs. To understand the origin of directional retinal waves, 
we used pharmacological, optogenetic, and genetic strategies to identify the retinal circuitry 
underlying the propagation bias. Finally, to evaluate the role of directional retinal waves in visual 
system development, we used pharmacological and genetic strategies to chronically manipulate 
wave directionality and used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses to visual motion 
in the midbrain superior colliculus immediately after eye opening.

RESULTS: We found that spontaneous retinal waves in mice exhibit a distinct propagation bias 
in the temporal-to-nasal direction during a transient window of development (postnatal day 8 
to day 11). The spatial geometry of directional wave flow aligns strongly with the optic flow 
pattern generated by forward self-motion, a dominant natural optic flow pattern after eye opening. 
We identified an intrinsic asymmetry in the retinal circuit that enforced the wave propagation 
bias involving the same circuit elements necessary for motion detection in the adult retina, 
specifically asymmetric inhibition from starburst amacrine cells through γ-aminobutyric acid 
type A (GABAA) receptors. Finally, manipulation of directional retinal waves, through either the 
chronic delivery of gabazine to block GABAergic inhibition or the starburst amacrine cell–specific 
mutation of the FRMD7 gene, impaired the development of responses to visual motion in superior 
colliculus neurons downstream of the retina.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that spontaneous activity in the developing retina prior to 
vision onset is structured to convey essential information for the development of visual response 
properties before the onset of visual experience. Spontaneous retinal waves simulate future optic 
flow patterns produced by forward motion through space, due to an asymmetric retinal circuit 
that has an evolutionarily conserved link with motion detection circuitry in the mature retina. 
Furthermore, the ethologically relevant information relayed by directional retinal waves enhances 
the development of higher-order visual function in the downstream visual system prior to eye 
opening. These findings provide insight into the activity-dependent mechanisms that regulate the 
self-organization of brain circuits before sensory experience begins.■
Abstract
The ability to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli emerges in the absence of sensory 
experience. Spontaneous retinal activity prior to eye opening guides the refinement of retinotopy 
and eye-specific segregation in mammals, but its role in the development of higher-order visual 
response properties remains unclear. Here, we describe a transient window in neonatal mouse 
development during which the spatial propagation of spontaneous retinal waves resembles the 
optic flow pattern generated by forward self-motion. We show that wave directionality requires 
the same circuit components that form the adult direction-selective retinal circuit and that 
chronic disruption of wave directionality alters the development of direction-selective responses 
of superior colliculus neurons. These data demonstrate how the developing visual system patterns 
spontaneous activity to simulate ethologically relevant features of the external world and thereby 
instruct self-organization.

Essential functions of the mammalian visual system, including the ability to locate objects 
and detect motion, are present even at the first onset of vision (1–7). How the visual system 
organizes its functional maturation before the start of sensory experience remains unclear. 
Prior to vision, spontaneous retinal activity occurs in the form of propagating waves that 
spread throughout the ascending visual system (8–10). Spontaneous retinal waves correlate 
the activity of neighboring cells in the retina and, through a Hebb-based mechanism, are 
critical for the development of visual maps (such as retinotopy and eye-specific segregation) 
that reflect near-neighbor relations in visual space (1,2,11–21). Whether and how the 
spatiotemporal pattern of spontaneous retinal waves conveys additional information beyond 
the gross correlations between topographically neighboring cells and contributes to the 
development of higher-order visual response properties remains unclear.
Spontaneous retinal waves in mice are divided into three stages according to their requisite 
mode of interneuronal communication (fig. S1A) (22). The spatiotemporal pattern of waves 
differs across these stages (10, 23, 24), but relatively little is known about whether or which 
of these spatiotemporal features might be relevant for visual system development. Previous 
studies have shown that retinal waves exhibit an early bias in propagation direction of 
unknown origin and function (9, 10, 18). In amphibian larvae, whose development takes 
place largely externally and in the presence of visual stimuli capable of driving retinal

activity, the direction of visual optic flow as the animal moves through space instructs visual 
system development (25). We sought to examine whether the directional propagation bias of 
spontaneous retinal waves prior to eye opening might also convey critical information for the 
functional maturation of the visual system in mammals.
Directional retinal waves resemble future optic flow
To determine the developmental time course of the directional bias in retinal waves, we 
examined the spontaneous activity of retinal ganglion cells in young mice at multiple ages 
throughout development in vivo. Spontaneous retinal activity was imaged in topographically 
mapped retinal ganglion cell axon arbors in the superior colliculus (Fig. 1A). To gain full 
access to retinal activity, we used Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice (cortexless mice) (26), which 
have a completely exposed superior colliculus due to suppressed cortical neurogenesis. 
Retinal ganglion cells were labeled with the genetically encoded calcium indicator 
GCaMP6s by intraocular injections of AAV2/1-hSyn-GCaMP6s virus at postnatal day 0 
to 1 (P0–P1) for calcium imaging of activity in retinal axon arbors in the superior colliculus 
at later ages (Fig. 1A). Spontaneous retinal activity was observed in all age groups between 
P3 and P29 in head-fixed, awake mice (movie S1).
During the first two postnatal weeks, wave directionality changed together with other 
spatiotemporal properties of waves, such as wave interval, duration, size, and propagation 
distance (fig. S1). In retinal coordinates, used throughout for data presentation and 
description, retinal waves exhibited a temporal-to-nasal directional bias, corresponding to 
forward-to-backward motion in visual space. The wave directional bias spanned the end of 
stage 2 (P8–P9) and persisted into stage 3 (P10–P11) (Fig. 1C and fig. S1F), even though 
waves at P8–P9 and P10–P11 differed in other spatiotemporal properties (Fig. 1B, fig. S1, 
B to E, and table S1). To exclude the possibility that the wave directional bias was due to 
the loss of cortex in Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice, we also examined retinal activity in mice 
with an intact cortex. A similar pattern of wave directionality was observed in mice with 
an intact cortex and in Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f (cortexless) mice with a restricted field of view 
to resemble cortex-intact mice (fig. S2 and table S1). These results reveal the presence of a 
developmentally transient temporal-to-nasal bias in wave propagation direction that spanned 
both stage 2 and stage 3 waves.
To examine whether locations across the superior colliculus experienced a consistent 
directional bias, we quantified the average wave propagation across each pixel separately. 
The pixel-based directionality analysis confirmed the temporal-to-nasal wave-based analysis 
across development (fig. S3). However, the pixel-based flow patterns were inhomogeneous 
and stereotypically deviated from the dominant temporal-to-nasal wave direction, depending 
on location in the superior colliculus (Fig. 1D and fig. S4A). We investigated the relationship 
between this stereotyped wave flow pattern and optic flow by first measuring retinotopy 
in the superior colliculus of cortexless mice after eye opening (~P21) (fig. S4B). We 
then compared the wave flow patterns with translatory or rotatory optic flow fields. To 
quantify the alignment between wave flow and translatory or rotatory optic flow fields, we 
calculated a concordance index (27) as the percentage of pixels with wave flow within 10° 
of local optic flow. We found that wave flow vectors were significantly better aligned with

a translatory optic flow field than with a rotary optic flow field (Fig. 1, E and F). The 
translatory optic flow alignment was best fit with a center of expansion in the temporal 
retina, consistent with the flow patterns produced by forward self-motion through space (fig. 
S5). These results demonstrate that spontaneous retinal waves prior to eye opening resemble 
forward translatory optic flow, the dominant future optic flow pattern received by animals as 
they move through space after eye opening.
Asymmetric GABAergic inhibition mediates wave directionality
To investigate whether directional retinal waves affect visual system development, we 
sought to first understand the origin of wave directionality. We considered two nonexclusive 
mechanisms for wave directionality (Fig. 2A). The first is an intrinsic propagation bias: an 
asymmetric retinal circuit that intrinsically favors wave propagation in the temporal-to-nasal 
direction. The second potential mechanism is an initiation bias: a tendency for waves to 
initiate at the temporal edge of the retina that could cause an overall temporal-tonasal 
directionality as waves travel away from the temporal edge.
We first examined the possibility of a propagation bias mechanism by assessing the 
directionality of waves initiated from the nasal part of the retina at P10–P11 (Fig. 2A). 
To control the site of wave initiation, we made use of exogenous stimuli. Starting around 
P9, photoreceptors are weakly but functionally integrated into the retinal circuit (28–31), 
which enabled us to evoke waves using focal light stimuli (Fig. 2B and movie S2). Waves 
stimulated in the nasal retina at P10–P11 exhibited the same temporal-to-nasal bias as 
spontaneous retinal waves (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting an inherent anisotropy in retinal 
circuitry that favors retinal wave propagation in the temporal-to-nasal direction at this age. 
Consistent with P10–P11, P8–P9 waves initiated in the nasal retina exhibited the same 
temporal-to-nasal bias (fig. S6, A to C). To ensure that the propagation bias was not an 
artifact of stimulation, we examined waves initiated in the nasal retina at P6–P7 when 
spontaneous retinal waves are not biased in the temporal-to-nasal direction. At this age, 
waves were initiated by optogenetic stimulation of starburst amacrine cells, interneurons that 
are responsible for stage 2 wave initiation and propagation (fig. S6A and movie S3). In 
contrast to P8–P9 and P10–P11, waves initiated in the nasal retina at P6–P7 were not biased 
in the temporal-to-nasal direction (fig. S6, B and C). We next quantified the distribution 
of wave initiation locations at P8–P9 and P10–P11. Although waves were equally likely to 
initiate from any location in the retina at P10–P11, there was an initiation bias at P8–P9 (fig. 
S6D). The initiation bias at P8–P9 could be due to an extra source of excitatory drive in the 
temporal retina at this age, or could be a consequence of the slow afterhyperpolarizations 
in the recurrent network of starburst amacrine cells that entrains an initiation zone (22, 
32–34). Regardless, neonatal mice at both P8–P9 and P10–P11 displayed a consistent retinal 
circuit propagation bias, which suggests a generic role of intrinsic propagation anisotropy in 
mediating retinal wave directionality that is absent at P6–P7.
We next investigated the origin of the propagation anisotropy described above. In the 
adult mouse retina, direction selectivity in retinal ganglion cells is achieved through 
asymmetric γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) inhibition (35, 36). We reasoned 
that asymmetric circuit wiring might also be present during development and provide

imbalanced inhibition to waves propagating in different directions to generate the observed 
propagation anisotropy. To determine whether asymmetric inhibition is involved in 
wave directionality, we examined wave directionality after the application of inhibitory 
antagonists to the retina in vivo at P10 (Fig. 2E). Application of gabazine, a GABAA 
receptor (GABAAR) antagonist, significantly reduced the wave directional bias (Fig. 2, F 
and G, and movie S4), whereas applications of TPMPA, a GABAC receptor (GABACR) 
antagonist, or strychnine, an antagonist of glycine, had little effect (fig. S7, A to C). As 
a result of disrupted wave directionality, the concordance between translatory optic flow 
and wave flow was significantly reduced after gabazine injection (fig. S7H). No other 
spatiotemporal feature was significantly altered by gabazine application, suggesting the 
specificity of GABAARs at this age in mediating wave directionality (fig. S7, D to G, 
and table S1). We further examined the directionality of exogenously stimulated waves 
after retinal application of gabazine (Fig. 2H). Consistent with the significant reduction 
of directional bias in spontaneous waves, stimulated waves were similarly disrupted after 
gabazine application (Fig. 2, I and J). These data demonstrate that asymmetric inhibition 
mediated by retinal GABAARs is crucial for wave directionality.
Wave directionality requires starburst amacrine cells
We next sought to identify the underlying cellular components that produce the asymmetric 
inhibition necessary for wave directionality. Starburst amacrine cells are known to confer 
motion direction-selective responses on direction-selective ganglion cells in the adult mouse 
retina (35, 37). This property suggests starburst amacrine cells as a candidate for providing 
asymmetric inhibition in wave propagation. However, in the developing retina, starburst 
amacrine cells are only thought to generate stage-2 retinal waves via their recurrent 
excitatory network (33), and little is known about the role of inhibition from starburst 
amacrine cells in wave propagation. To examine the role of starburst amacrine cells in 
directional waves, we selectively ablated starburst amacrine cells through daily retinal 
application of diphtheria toxin (DT) from P5 to P7 in ChAT-Cre; LSL-DTR mice, which 
specifically express DT receptors in starburst amacrine cells (Fig. 3, A and B), and examined 
wave directionality at P10. Retinal waves in P10 starburst amacrine cell–ablated animals 
maintained a normal peak wave area and propagation distance relative to controls (fig. 
S8, B to E, table S1, and movie S5) but had significantly disrupted wave directionality 
(Fig. 3, D and E). Wave directionality in starburst amacrine cell–ablated animals was not 
further altered after gabazine injection (fig. S8A), consistent with GABAAR-dependent wave 
directionality acting through starburst amacrine cells. These results reveal that generation 
of the temporal-to-nasal wave directional bias observed at P10 requires starburst amacrine 
cells.
To further identify the features of starburst amacrine cells crucial for wave directionality, 
we examined retinal waves in transgenic animals that have a starburst amacrine cell–
specific mutation of the FRMD7 gene (38, 39). In the adult retina, mutation of FRMD7 
abolishes temporal and nasal retinal ganglion cell direction selectivity by eliminating the 
asymmetry of inhibition from starburst amacrine cells onto temporal- or nasal-preferring 
direction-selective ganglion cells (38). During development, spontaneous retinal waves in 
FRMD7tm mice displayed a significant disruption in wave directionality similar to that

observed in starburst amacrine cell–ablated animals (Fig. 3, F and G). The disruption in 
wave directionality in FRMD7tm mice was not further altered by gabazine (fig. S6F), and 
other wave properties remained unchanged (fig. S6, G to J, table S1, and movie S5). 
These results show that asymmetric inhibition from starburst amacrine cells, which confer 
direction selectivity in the adult retina, is also necessary for mediating temporal-to-nasal 
wave directionality during development. Taken together with the finding that gabazine 
blocks wave directionality, our data suggest that asymmetric GABAAR-mediated inhibition 
by starburst amacrine cells is necessary for the transient temporal-to-nasal directional bias in 
spontaneous retinal waves during development.
Because starburst amacrine cells in the adult retina provide asymmetric inhibition to 
downstream direction-selective ganglion cells as well as to neighboring starburst amacrine 
cells or other amacrine cells (27, 37, 40, 41), it remains unclear which asymmetric inhibitory 
connection mediates wave directionality. To determine whether starburst amacrine cells 
modulate wave directionality by providing asymmetric inhibition onto direction-selective 
ganglion cells, we examined wave directionality in two different subtypes of direction-
selective ganglion cells: Cdh6-positive ganglion cells that receive asymmetric inhibition 
from starburst amacrine cells along the dorsal-ventral axis (42) and JamB-positive ganglion 
cells that lack strong asymmetric inhibitory input from starburst amacrine cells in the adult 
retina (43). If wave directionality arises at the synapse between starburst amacrine cells and 
direction-selective ganglion cells, which emerges around P8 (44, 45), we should observe a 
dorsal-ventral propagation bias in Cdh6-positive ganglion cells and little propagation bias 
in JamB-positive ganglion cells at P10. However, waves in both JamB-positive and Cdh6-
positive ganglion cells propagated in the temporal-to-nasal direction (fig. S9 and movie 
S6). These data demonstrate that retinal ganglion cells inherit biased propagating activity 
from upstream circuits in the retina, not from asymmetric inhibitory inputs from starburst 
amacrine cells onto direction-selective ganglion cells. Our results also suggest that starburst 
amacrine cells modulate wave directionality by providing inhibition onto other cell types 
involved in wave propagation, perhaps onto starburst amacrine cells themselves during stage 
2 and directly onto bipolar cells or indirectly onto bipolar cells via other amacrine cells (41) 
during stage 3 (Fig. 3H). Further experiments are required to test these hypotheses.
Directional retinal waves enhance downstream visual function
To directly probe the role of directional waves in visual system development, we chronically 
manipulated the directionality of spontaneous retinal waves and measured the visual 
function of neurons in the superior colliculus at eye opening. We used two-photon imaging 
to record the activity of neurons expressing nucleus-targeted GCaMP6s in the superior 
colliculus of Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice (Fig. 4A). To specifically disrupt wave directionality, 
we performed intraocular injections of gabazine (or saline) every 24 hours from P7 to P12 
(Fig. 4A). We collected cellular responses in the superficial layers (50 to 60 μm) at the 
center of the superior colliculus 2 to 4 days after the last gabazine treatment (at P14–P16) 
in awake head-fixed mice as they viewed drifting grating visual stimuli (Fig. 4A). Drifting 
gratings elicited responses from similar proportions of neurons in saline-treated and chronic 
gabazine-treated mice (fig. S10A). Cells that preferentially responded to certain directions 
or orientations were found in both groups (Fig. 4C and supplementary materials). For

all responsive cells, we measured the strength of direction and orientation tuning with a 
global direction selectivity index (gDSI) and a global orientation selectivity index (gOSI). 
We observed a significant reduction overall in the direction selectivity of cells in chronic 
gabazine–treated mice relative to saline controls (Fig. 4D). In contrast, gabazine treatment 
had little effect on the orientation selectivity of neurons in the superior colliculus (fig. 
S11A).
To determine whether disruption of wave directionality affected the selectivity of neurons 
for specific stimulus directions, we divided the responsive cells into eight groups according 
to their preferred direction and compared the tuning strength in each group. We observed 
a significant change in the distribution of gDSI across directions in chronic gabazine–
treated mice in comparison to saline-treated mice, but the strength of direction selectivity 
was not significantly altered in any single direction (Fig. 4E and fig. S10B). We next 
examined whether the disruption of wave directionality altered the proportion of direction-
selective cells preferring different directions. To do so, we computed the proportion of 
direction-selective cells preferring each direction among all responding cells. Consistent 
with the overall reduction in the strength of direction selectivity, we observed that the 
overall proportion of direction-selective cells was also significantly reduced in chronic 
gabazine–treated mice relative to saline-treated mice (Fig. 4F). We also observed that the 
distribution of direction preference across the eight different directions was significantly 
altered in chronic gabazine–treated mice relative to saline-treated mice, with a significant 
reduction in the dorsal direction (Fig. 4G and fig. S10C). Finally, we examined whether 
orientation selectivity was impaired in an orientation-dependent way, even though gabazine 
treatment had no impact on overall orientation tuning. No difference between saline- and 
gabazine-treated groups was observed in the tuning strength for any orientation (fig. S11, A 
and B), and the proportion of orientation-selective cells preferring each orientation among 
all responding cells was not significantly different between saline and gabazine groups (fig. 
S11C).
Because the effects of gabazine had a restricted duration in vivo (fig. S13), the manipulation 
of wave directionality using chronic intraocular injections of gabazine was likely limited. 
To more consistently disrupt wave directionality, we examined the direction-selective 
responses of superior colliculus neurons in Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f; FRMD7tm mice, which 
lack a temporal-to-nasal wave directional bias, as described earlier (Fig. 3, F and G). 
Like our findings in chronic gabazine–treated mice, we observed a significant impact on 
direction selectivity, but not orientation selectivity, of neurons in the superior colliculus of 
FRMD7tm mice at eye opening (P14–P16) relative to littermate controls (Fig. 4, J to M, 
and fig. S11, D to F). In particular, there was a significant decrease overall in the direction 
selectivity of responding neurons in FRMD7tm mice relative to littermate controls (Fig. 
4J) and a significant change in the distribution of gDSI across the eight directions, with 
significant reductions in the temporal quadrant of directions in retinal coordinates (Fig. 4K 
and fig. S10E). Like the results of chronic gabazine treatment, we also observed a significant 
reduction in the overall proportion of direction-selective neurons among all responding 
neurons in the superior colliculus of FRMD7tm mice (Fig. 4L). When divided according to 
direction preference, we also observed a significant change in the distribution of direction 
preference in FRMD7tm mice relative to control mice, with a significant reduction in the

temporal quadrant (Fig. 4M and fig. S10F). Direction selectivity is reduced in temporal- and 
nasal-preferring direction-selective retinal ganglion cells in FMRD7tm mice (38), which may 
have contributed to the changes observed here in the superior colliculus. However, although 
there was an overall reduction in both the tuning and proportion of direction-selective cells 
in the superior colliculus of FMRD7tm mice, only cells preferring the temporal and not the 
nasal quadrant of directions were significantly disrupted. This finding suggests that both 
the retina and colliculus may contribute to the disrupted development of direction-selective 
responses in superior colliculus neurons of FMRD7tm mice.
To further examine whether impaired direction selectivity in the superior colliculus 
in chronic gabazine–treated and FRMD7tm mice was a product of abnormal direction 
selectivity derived from the retina or alterations emerging in the superior colliculus, we 
treated mice with a single (acute) application of intraocular gabazine at eye opening 
immediately before imaging (fig. S14A). Gabazine application to the retina is known to 
disrupt direction-selective responses in retinal ganglion cells (44). In contrast to the effects 
of chronic gabazine well before eye opening (Fig. 4 and fig. S10), superior colliculus 
neurons in mice that received an acute gabazine injection showed no significant difference in 
the strength of direction selectivity or the proportion of direction-selective neurons (fig. S14, 
B to F), whereas direction-selective responses in the nasal but not the temporal quadrant 
were modestly degraded in the superior colliculus relative to controls (fig. S14, B to H). 
The differential effects of acute and chronic gabazine treatment on direction selectivity 
and the proportion of direction-selective cells suggests that disruptions in the development 
of circuits in the superior colliculus likely contribute to changes in the selectivity of 
superior colliculus neurons in chronic gabazine–treated mice and FRMD7tm mice (Fig. 4 
and fig. S10), although disruptions in the retina may also contribute. Overall, these results 
demonstrate that interfering with the directional bias of spontaneous retinal waves during 
development compromises the emergence of direction-selective responses in the superior 
colliculus at eye opening, highlighting the role of directional retinal waves in the emergence 
of functional response properties in mice.
Prior studies show that spontaneous retinal waves are necessary for the refinement of 
retinotopy in the superior colliculus (11, 12, 20, 21). To investigate whether the impairment 
in direction selectivity in the superior colliculus can be explained by altered retinotopy, we 
quantified the refinement of retinotopy in the superior colliculus in mice with disrupted 
wave directionality. No difference was observed between the sizes of retinal ganglion cell 
arbors in the superior colliculus in FRMD7tm mice and littermate controls (fig. S15). 
Furthermore, retinotopy measured at eye opening was similar between chronic gabazine–
treated and chronic saline-treated mice (fig. S16). These data suggest that retinotopic 
refinement remained normal in mice with disrupted wave directionality, and exclude the 
possibility that retinotopic impairment contributes to the reduction of direction selectivity in 
the superior colliculus after the manipulation of wave directionality.
Discussion
Our data show that spontaneous retinal waves during development exhibit a distinct and 
strong propagation bias in the temporal-to-nasal direction during a transient window of

development (P8 to P11) in mice. Directional waves mimic the translatory optic flow pattern 
that would be produced by an animal’s own forward motion through space, a dominant 
optic flow pattern that is ethologically relevant after eye opening. Wave directionality during 
development is enforced by asymmetric inhibition through starburst amacrine cells mediated 
by GABAARs, which is the same circuit element necessary for the computation of direction 
selectivity by retinal ganglion cells in the adult (35, 37). Disrupting the directionality of 
spontaneous retinal waves compromises the emergence of direction-selective neurons in 
the superior colliculus at eye opening, causing a general degradation in direction-selective 
responses and linking visual motion detection to retinal wave patterns during development.
The results of in vitro experiments suggest that starburst amacrine cells are responsible 
for the generation of stage 2 (P1–P9) retinal waves via their recurrent cholinergic 
neurotransmission (22, 32–34, 46). Here, we showed that starburst amacrine cells also 
enforce biased propagation of waves, even at P10–P11 when stage 3 waves are dependent 
on glutamatergic, not cholinergic, neurotransmission. Specifically, we found that asymmetric 
inhibitory outputs from starburst amacrine cells, which confer motion direction selectivity 
in direction-selective ganglion cells after the onset of vision (35–37), also mediate the 
temporal-to-nasal bias in wave directionality. This reveals an evolutionarily conserved link 
between the retinal circuitry responsible for biased wave propagation during development 
and the motion detection circuitry in mature retinas. There are also some differences 
between the developmental starburst amacrine cell–dependent wave propagation circuitry 
and the adult motion detection circuitry. Retinal waves in JamB-positive and Cdh6-positive 
ganglion cells, which prefer dorsal or ventral directions of motion in the adult retina, 
exhibit the same temporal-to-nasal wave propagation bias as the overall population of 
retinal ganglion cells during development. Because JamB-positive ganglion cells receive 
little inhibition from starburst amacrine cells (43), and because Cdh6-positive ganglion 
cells receive asymmetric inhibition from starburst amacrine cells along the dorsal-ventral 
axis (42), these results suggest that wave directionality is not generated by asymmetric 
inhibition from starburst amacrine cells onto direction-selective ganglion cells. Instead, 
direct or indirect asymmetric inhibition from starburst amacrine cells onto cells that are 
required for wave propagation—that is, starburst amacrine cells during stage 2 and bipolar 
cells during stage 3—mediates wave propagation bias.
Notably, the spatial geometry of the directional wave flow field resembles translatory 
optic flow from forward motion, which is the same optic flow pattern preferred by nasal-
preferring direction-selective ganglion cells in the adult retina (27). This suggests that the 
asymmetric dendrites of starburst amacrine cells along the temporal-nasal axis that provide 
inhibition to nasal-preferring direction-selective ganglion cells—perhaps because they 
develop precociously or are more numerous (27)—may contribute the most to directional 
wave propagation. Further experiments are needed to examine this hypothesis.
Chronic blockade of GABAA transmission does not alter the development of direction 
selectivity in the retina, at least for a subset of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells for 
which this has been tested (44, 47). In our experiments, we observed that blocking retinal 
direction selectivity with gabazine injections at eye opening, but leaving the directional 
waves intact earlier during development, resulted in little disruption in the direction

selectivity of superior colliculus neurons. Moreover, FRMD7tm mice that lack a temporal-to-
nasal wave directional bias exhibited a general disruption in the strength and proportion 
of direction-selective neurons in the superior colliculus, with a more specific effect on 
direction-selective cells preferring the temporal quadrant of directions. These results suggest 
that impaired direction selectivity of neurons in the superior colliculus after the disruption of 
wave directionality is not fully explained by disruptions in retinal ganglion cell directional 
selectivity, and likely involves miswiring between the retina and the superior colliculus or 
within the superior colliculus. Our data also suggest that direction selectivity in superior 
colliculus neurons at eye opening, unlike the adult (48), is not wholly dependent on 
direction-selective inputs from the retina. Further experiments are needed to determine the 
origin and mechanism underlying the computation of direction selectivity in the developing 
superior colliculus.
We used Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f (cortexless) mice because they have a fully accessible superior 
colliculus due to cortical agenesis. Although the absence of cortical feedback to the superior 
colliculus may compromise some visual functions (26, 49), retinal waves in cortexless 
mice were similar to those in mice with an intact cortex, which suggests that waves 
were not altered in the absence of cortex during development. Previous studies also show 
that Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice have normal direction selectivity, orientation selectivity, and 
ON-OFF responses in the superior colliculus (26, 49), indicating that the impairment of 
direction selectivity we observed in Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice after the disruption of wave 
directionality is not attributable to cortical agenesis.
Our experiments demonstrate that spontaneous retinal activity is self-structured to convey 
information essential for the development of visual response properties before the onset of 
visual experience. By simulating ethologically relevant features of the external environment, 
spontaneous retinal activity specifically and causally enhances higher-order visual function 
at eye opening. This is analogous to amphibian larvae, in which visual optic flow as the 
animal moves forward through space contributes to the development of retinotopy (25), as 
well as preplay in the developing mammalian hippocampus, where preconfigured sequences 
of neuronal firing foreshadow the development of hippocampal place cell memory function 
(50). Future experiments are necessary to determine the detailed mechanism by which wave 
directionality instructs the development of direction selectivity of neurons in the superior 
colliculus. Spontaneous retinal waves are transmitted through the entire developing visual 
system (9, 10). Whether wave directionality contributes to the functional development of 
other downstream visual areas remains to be established.
Methods summary
All animal procedures followed the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC), the US Department of Health and Human Services, and institution guidelines. 
Mouse pups received intraocular or intracollicular injections of virus encoding GCaMP6s 
at P0–P1 and were prepared with a craniotomy over the superior colliculus at later ages 
for wide-field calcium imaging of retinal ganglion cell axons in the superior colliculus or 
two-photon calcium imaging of superior colliculus neurons, respectively. Light stimulation 
or optogenetic stimulation of the retina was applied to initiate retinal waves in vivo. Retinal

waves after acute intraocular injections of gabazine, TPMPA, or strychnine in mice at P10 
were measured and analyzed to assess the role of inhibition in wave directionality. To ablate 
starburst amacrine cells, intraocular injections of diphtheria toxin (0.8 ng/μl in PBS) or PBS 
in littermate controls were performed daily from P5 to P7 in ChAT-Cre; iDTR mice. Daily 
gabazine (200 μM) injections (or saline injections in control mice) were performed from 
P7 to P12 to chronically disrupt wave directionality during development. Procedures for the 
experiments and data analyses are described in the supplementary materials.

Fig. 1. Spontaneous retinal waves are directional and resemble translatory optic flow during a 
transient developmental window.
(A)Schematic showing the wide-field single-photon microscopy used to perform Ca2+ 
imaging of retinal ganglion cell axon activity in the superior colliculus (SC). GCaMP6s 
expression in retinal ganglion cells was achieved by intraocular injections of AAV2/1-hSyn-
GCaMP6s at P0 in Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice. A cranial window above the SC was surgically 
prepared before imaging. Mice were unanesthetized and head-fixed during the imaging. 
Scale bar, 500 μm. (B) △F/F montages of example waves at P8–P9 (top) and P10–P11 
(bottom). (C) Frequency distributions of propagation directions for all waves at P8–P9 [n 
= 5 hemispheres, 831 waves, total circular variance (CV) = 0.6087] and at P10–P11 (n = 
8 hemispheres, 7937 waves, total CV = 0.5611). Inset at right: Directions T, N, D, and V 
correspond to temporal, nasal, dorsal, and ventral in the retina unless otherwise stated. (D)

P8–P11 (n = 13 hemispheres). Optic flow fields were generated from retinotopic maps in 
the SC (see supplementary materials for details). Forward and upward indicate directions 
in visual space. (F) Concordance index between wave and translatory or rotatory optic 
flow as a function of the axis of the animal’s translation or rotation. All possible axes of 
translation or rotation were tested. Concordance index is the percentage of pixels on the 
SC that have the same direction (<10° difference) as the local optic flow. Top: Spherical 
maps of average concordance index (n = 13 hemispheres) between wave and translatory 
(top left) and rotatory (top right) optic flow in global visual space. The best match between 
wave flow and optic flow due to translation deviated slightly from forward motion (10° 
elevation and 15° azimuth). Bottom: Flattened concordance maps. Black bars indicate the 
forward and upward directions in visual space. Right: Maximum concordance index between 
individual wave flow fields and translatory optic flow was much higher than rotatory optic 
flow (translatory, 0.611 ± 0.026; rotatory, 0.438 ± 0.025; n = 13 hemispheres; **P = 0.0012, 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test). *P <0.05,**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Data are means ± SEM.

that received intraocular injections of AAV2/1-hSyn-GCaMP6s at P0–P1. (F) Frequency 
distributions of wave propagation directions in animals without gabazine injection (before, 
n = 8 hemispheres, total CV = 0.561) or after gabazine injection (after, n = 6 hemispheres, 
total CV = 0.931) at P10. (G) Gabazine reduced the proportion of waves propagating within 
60° of the dominant temporal-to-nasal direction (control, 0.456 ± 0.044; gabazine, 0.234 ± 
0.021; **P = 0.003, Wilcoxon rank sum test). (H) Light stimuli were applied in Emx1-Cre; 
Tra2βf/f mice before and after gabazine injection to the eye, following the same protocol 
described in (A). (I) Pixel-based activity flow directions within stim ROIs 0 to 10 s after 
each stimulation before (n = 5 animals, total CV = 0.682) and after gabazine injection (n = 
5 animals, total CV = 0.938). (J) Gabazine injections reduced the proportion of pixel-based 
activity flow vectors within 60° surrounding the dominant direction. Data points from the 
same hemisphere were paired (before, 0.267 ± 0.040; after, 0.152 ± 0.020; *P = 0.031, 
one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test). All boxplots report medians with the 75% confidence 
interval unless otherwise noted.

Fig. 3. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) mediate wave directionality.
(A) AAV2/1-hSyn-GCaMP6s was intraocularly injected in ChAT-Cre; LSL-DTR mouse 
pups at P0. Intraocular injections of diphtheria toxin (DT, 0.8 ng/μl, or PBS as controls) 
were performed every 24 hours between P5 and P7. (B) Immunostaining of ChAT in the 
whole-mount retina at P10 with (left) or without (right) DT treatment. Scale bar, 20 μm. 
Images were background-subtracted. (C) Number of SACs per unit area (1 × 104 μm2). Each 
data point represents the averaged quantification from one retina (no inj: n = 8 retinas, 16.79 
± 0.74; PBS: n = 6 retinas, 14.17 ± 1.36; DT: n = 7 retinas, 2.98 ± 0.67; ***P = 0.0009,

Kruskal-Wallis test; Tukey’s post hoc test, no injection versus PBS P = 0.659, no injection 
versus DT ***P = 7.405 × 10−4, PBS versus DT *P = 0.028). (D) Frequency distributions 
of wave propagation directions show that SAC-depleted retinas lack temporal-to-nasal 
propagation bias. Left to right, no injection (n = 8 hemispheres, total CV = 0.5167), PBS-
injected (n = 10 hemispheres, total CV = 0.5475), and DT-injected (n = 7 hemispheres, total 
CV = 0.8373). (E) Proportion of wave propagation directions within 60° surrounding the 
dominant direction (no inj = 0.347 ± 0.014; PBS = 0.332 ± 0.027; DT = 0.146 ± 0.021; **P 
= 0.0011, Kruskal-Wallis test; Tukey’s post hoc test, no injection versus DT-injected **P = 
0.0043, PBS injection versus DT-injected **P = 0.0024, no injection versus PBS-injected P 
= 1). (F) Left: FRMD7tm mice received intraocular injections of AAV2/1-hSyn-GCaMP6s at 
P0. Middle right: FRMD7tm mice lack temporal-to-nasal wave propagation bias as revealed 
by the frequency distribution of wave propagation directions in littermate controls (n = 11 
hemispheres, total CV = 0.559) and in FRMD7tm mice (n = 9 hemispheres, total CV = 
0.9214) at P10. (G) Proportion of wave propagation directions within 60° surrounding the 
dominant direction (control, 0.353 ± 0.027; FRMD7tm, 0.145 ± 0.010; ***P = 1.971 × 10−6, 
Wilcoxon rank sum test). Dashed black lines in (E) and (G) indicate the fraction in the 
dominant direction if wave propagation directions are random. (H) Schematic models of 
retinal circuits that generate temporal-to-nasal directional waves during stage 2 (left) and 
stage 3 (right). Left: Stage 2 retinal waves propagate via SAC release of acetylcholine (blue) 
onto other cells, wave directionality is mediated by asymmetric GABAergic inhibition (red) 
among the recurrent SAC network. Greater inhibition on the nasal SAC dendrite prevents 
temporal propagation of waves. Right: Stage 3 retinal waves propagate via spillover of 
glutamate (green) from bipolar cells (BCs) onto other BCs, wave directionality is mediated 
by asymmetric GABAergic inhibition among SACs, and their feedback onto BCs. Feedback 
from SACs onto BCs may also be relayed by other types of intermediate amacrine cells in 
the retina (41).

Fig. 4. Wave directionality instructs development of visual response properties.
(A) AAV2/9-Syn-Intron-H2B-GCaMP6s was injected into both hemispheres of the SC in 
Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f mice at P0–P1. Mouse pups then received daily (chronic) intraocular 
injections of gabazine (200 μM) from P7 to P12. Two-photon imaging of SC neurons in the 
center of the left SC in response to visual stimuli presented to the right eye was performed 
in P14–P16 mice. (B) Example two-photon field of view in the SC ~50 mm from the 
surface. Scale bar, 50 μm. (C) Average fluorescence signal (△F/F ± SD) of individual 
neurons in the left SC of an example saline-treated P15 mouse (left) and an example chronic

gabazine–treated P15 mouse (right) in response to 20 repetitions each of drifting gratings 
in eight directions. For each trial, gratings were static for 8 s, drifting for 8 s, and then 
static for another 8 s before switching to another direction. Solid lines, averaged △F/F 
signal where colored part indicates the △F/F during drifting grating period; gray shadow, 
SD of △F/F. Top, direction of drifting grating stimuli. The left most direction is nasal-to-
temporal (backward-to-forward in visual space), the third from the left is ventral-to-dorsal 
(upward-to-downward in visual space). (Right) Polar plots of the averaged responses to each 
direction, with inset showing temporal (T), nasal (N), dorsal, (D) and ventral (V) directions 
in retinal coordinates. (D) Median gDSI of all responding cells in chronic gabazine–treated 
mice (n = 9) was significantly lower than in saline-treated mice (n = 8) (saline, 0.265 
± 0.025; gabazine, 0.175 ± 0.021; **P = 0.008, Wilcoxon rank sum test). (E) Polar plot 
showing the median gDSI of responding cells in saline- and gabazine-treated mice. Cells 
were divided into eight groups according to the directions for which they had the largest 
responses (see supplementary materials). The distribution of gDSI across directions was 
significantly altered in chronic gabazine–treated mice in comparison to saline-treated mice 
(***P =2.724 × 10−4, Mack-Skillings test; P > 0.05 for individual directions, Wilcoxon 
rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment). Solid line and 
shadow, mean ± SEM of median gDSI across all animals. Polar plot r range, [0, 0.45]. 
(F) The proportion of direction-selective (DS) cells (gDSI > 0.25) among all responding 
cells was significantly reduced in chronic gabazine–treated mice relative to saline-treated 
mice (saline = 0.208 ± 0.017, gabazine = 0.113 ± 0.023; **P = 0.008, Wilcoxon rank 
sum test). (G) The distribution of direction preference of DS cells among all responding 
cells was significantly altered in chronic gabazine–treated mice relative to saline-treated 
mice (***P = = 4.002 × 10−6, Mack-Skillings test), with a significant reduction in the 
dorsal direction (**P = 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg false 
discovery rate adjustment). Solid line and shadow, mean ± SEM of proportions across 
all mice. Polar plot r range, [0, 0.07]. (H) Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f; FRMD7tm and littermate 
control mice received AAV2/9-Syn-Intron-H2B-GCaMP6s injections into the SC at P0–P1 
and then visual response properties of SC neurons were measured using two-photon imaging 
of the center of left SC at P14–P16. (I) Average fluorescence signals (△F/F ± SD) of 
individual neurons in the left SC of an example littermate control P15 mouse (upper) and 
an example Emx1-Cre; Tra2βf/f; FRMD7tm P15 mouse (lower) in response to 20 repetitions 
of drifting gratings in each of eight directions. (J) The median gDSI of all responding 
cells was significantly reduced in FRMD7tm mice (n = 6 animals) relative to controls (n 
= 8 animals) (control, 0.182 ± 0.035; FRMD7tm, 0.144 ± 0.021; *P = 0.029, Wilcoxon 
rank sum test). (K) The distribution of gDSI across directions was significantly altered in 
FRMD7tm mice relative to control mice (***P = 2.361 × 10−13, Mack-Skillings test), with 
a significant reduction in the ventral-temporal (*P = 0.021), temporal (**P = 0.005), and 
dorsal-temporal (*P = 0.011) directions (Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg 
false discovery rate adjustment). Solid line and shadow, mean ± SEM of median gDSI across 
all animals. Polar plot r range, [0, 0.45]. (L) The proportion of DS cells (gDSI > 0.25) 
among all responding cells was significantly reduced in FRMD7tm mice relative to control 
mice (control = 0.211 ± 0.012, FRMD7tm = 0.141 ± 0.028; *P = 0.029, Wilcoxon rank 
sum test). (M) The distribution of direction preference of DS cells among all responding 
cells was significantly altered in FRMD7tm mice relative to control mice (***P = 2.569 ×
