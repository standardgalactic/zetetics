Touch typing is not difficult to learn. It is easy. Like golf 
or any other game where timing and rhythm are essential, 
practice is the most important factor. Practice alone can make 
you a good, fast touch typist in the shortest time. 
The five simple lessons given in this book have been 
scientifically planned by typing experts. A half hour devoted 
to each lesson, plus adequate practice, will give you a sound 
working knowledge of touch typing for home use. 
You are joining the ranks of thousands of students, 
business plen, home-makers-people in every walk of life 
-who are deriving immeasurable benefits from their- type-
writers. 
Now turn the page and get started on the modern way 
to write-touch typing on the Royal Portable .

ouch typing and 
your Royal 
so MANY daily uses 
Your whole family will use and 
enjoy the many benefits a Royal 
Portable o:ff ers. For example Dad 
will type his records, reports, ideas ... 
anything. Instead of old fashioned 
_handwriting he can have clear, sharp, 
typed copies of everything he writes 
at home-just as h~ does in the office. 
Mother will be happy to see her 
menus, grocery lists, reminders, etc., clearly~ sharply typed on 
a Royal Portable. And Brother and Sister will type their 
themes and compositions on the Royal-resulting in clear, 
sharp, legible papers teachers will enjoy reading; 
Can a student get highermarks 
when he types his written work? The 
an~wer is yes. Thousands of experi-
ments performed with students prove 
that those who use typewriters ge't 
I 7 o/o more work done and make defi-
nitely higher grades in mariy subjects. · 
So a portable typewriter is a big help 
for school work .. And a Royal Port-
able will help the most because Royal is the standard type-

writer in portable size. This means that when you switch from 
a Royal Portable to an office typewriter you feel at home on 
the HOME KEYS because the keyboard is exactly the same. 
For personal correspondence 
the portable typewriter is ideal. 
Typewritten letters are clear, easily 
read by the recipient. And because 
typewritten letters are neat and at-
tractive they speak well for you-
make a good' impression. Too, you 
can personalize your typing just as 
your handwriting is personalized. For 
example you can select a tastefully colored typewrite1~ ribbon 
to harmonize with practically any stationery you prefer. 
An ideal traveling companion, 
the Royal Portable is ready to go to 
work for you any place ... car, bus, 
boat, train, plane-or in your hotel 
room. The carrying case for the 
Royal Portable is smart and attrac-
tive. It will be a complement to the 
rest of yoµr luggage, anywhere. If 
no desk or table is handy, the special 
construction of the case enables you to use it as ah auxiliary 
desk. When the case is not in use for carrying the machine, -
it serves as an attractive overnight case. 

How to set up a 
Bilsiness Letter 
A balanced appearance is important in a good letter. 
MAGIC* M·argin on the Royal Portable helps you 
"tailor" the margin, ensures proper control of white space. 
POSITION OF DATE LINE 
The end of the date· line should be even with 
the right margin or centered under letterhead.
