Abstract. The free energy principle (FEP) is a mathematical and sci-
entific principle that describes the relationship between the physical be-
havior of a dynamical system and the interpretation of such behavior
as carrying out inference. It blurs the boundary between the ontologi-
cal mode of the system of interest and the epistemological significance it
acquires through its dynamic interaction with the environment. New ma-
terialism (or neo-materialism), despite lacking a single definition, refers
to a range of emerging perspectives that attempt to dismantle the long-
held divisions between ontology, epistemology, and even ethics, with the
aim of achieving a comprehensive transformation of naturalized think-
ing. In this context, new materialism provides powerful tools to reframe
some of the conceptual foundations of the FEP. This paper is the first
in a series that aims to systematically construct a neo-materialistic per-
spective for the FEP, exploring its wide-ranging implications. It serves
as an introduction to the series, arguing for the justification of deploy-
ing new materialism to reframe the FEP and introducing some essential
concepts to be utilized in developing a neo-materialistic account of the
FEP.

Introduction
Studying the behavior of self-organizing and complex adaptive systems has been
a subject of increasing interest for at least half a century. In recent years,
Bayesian mechanics has emerged as a general probabilistic framework for mod-
eling autonomous physical systems, particularly those that exhibit statistical
tracking between the trajectories of their internal states and the parameters
of their external states [22][48]. Bayesian mechanics relies on the free energy
principle as its central theoretical underpinning, which enables the information
geometry associated with such systems to be encoded with probabilistic rep-
resentations (“beliefs”) about both their internal and external states. As such,

it is conducive to the development of an ontology that highlights three key as-
pects: (1) the dynamic and indeterminate nature of “reality,” (2) the iterative
and hierarchical structure of its constituent processes, and (3) self-relational
understanding of its phenomena.
Over the last two decades, the term “new materialism” (or neo-materialism)
is used as an umbrella term to encompass a range of philosophical stances that
radically reject a number of deeply entrenched views in the history of Western
philosophy concerning the nature of matter and reality [50][26]. Despite a signifi-
cant diversity of perspectives within new materialism, which at times even reveal
diametric oppositions, the three aspects mentioned above are among its primary
concerns. However, certain strands of new materialism are more aligned with
the conceptual assertions of Bayesian mechanics and the free energy principle
(FEP) than others.
The aim of the present paper, as well as subsequent ones, is to systemati-
cally develop a neo-materialistic account of FEP and Bayesian mechanics, while
exploring its far-reaching implications. The primary objective of this paper is
to introduce the essential tools necessary for the development of such an ac-
count. The first section provides a concise introduction to the classical view of
the FEP. The following section briefly outlines the most prevalent forms of new
materialism, and discusses their compatibility with the core tenets of the FEP.
Subsequently, Manuel DeLanda’s notion of the structure of possibility spaces is
introduced as a central element of our account, along with its relevance to the
FEP. Finally, by utilizing the concepts introduced earlier, the FEP is examined
through the lens of Karen Barad’s agential realism, thereby establishing the
groundwork for forthcoming discussions.

A Brief Overview of Classical FEP
The free energy principle (FEP), proposed by Karl Friston in 2006 [24], is a
general physics of information that explains how autonomous agents or self-
organizing physical systems maintain their structure and functionality over time
despite a changing environment. This persistence through time is evidenced by
repeated observation of the system’s characteristic states and dynamics. FEP can
be seen as an adaptation of the variational principle of least action, which posits
that a system must appear as if its active and internal states follow paths of least
action, minimizing variational free energy, in order to satisfy the aforementioned
conditions. [23].
Variational free energy is a functional that depends on approximate Bayesian
beliefs regarding the external states. As the name implies, it is associated with
the concept of free energy in statistical physics [19]. More precisely, it has been
demonstrated that, under Laplace assumption, the form of variational free energy
is equivalent to the form of Gibsonian free energy [21]. Nevertheless, depending
on its mathematical expression, it allows for various interpretations that are
closely related and relevant to well-known ideas in cognitive modeling [45]. In
particular, it serves as an upper bound for the statistical divergence between

the sensory states of a system and its expectations or predictions regarding
those states. In other words, it enables optimization of the prediction error or
surprisal that a system encounters based on its model of the world, also known
as the generative model.
FEP suggests that systems exhibit behavior as if they seek to minimize free
energy (surprisal) through two processes: (1) continuously updating their gener-
ative model to better align with incoming sensory data from the environment,
and (2) performing actions that induce changes in the environment, further im-
proving the congruence between sensory data and the generative model. This
integrated framework, which views action and perception as interconnected, is
known as active inference [45].
A key concept in FEP is the notion of Markov blanket, which partitions
the entire state space of a system into internal and external states while also
establishing their interdependence though sparse coupling. Markov blanket acts
as an interface and boundary within the state space and is not necessarily a
spatiotemporal boundary. In many instances, however, it manifests as a physical
boundary in space-time, such as cell membranes [48][49][37].
The states within Markov blanket are influenced by the system and, in turn,
influence the system itself, while also being influenced by the environment. Thus,
the internal states of the system can vicariously track the external states without
direct access to them. This statistical boundary enables the system to maintain
its organization and resist disorder. Furthermore, minimizing free energy across
Markov blanket maximizes the evidence in support of the system’s own genera-
tive model. This process is known as self-evidencing [34].

Why New Materialism?
New materialism, a term coined by Manuel DeLanda and Rosi Braidotti in the
late 1990s, is a hypernym that refers to a spectrum of emerging perspectives.
These perspectives, in one way or another, attempt to challenge the deeply
ingrained anthropocentric and even biocentric views of Euro-Western tradition
[43][36][9]. While new materialism lacks a single unifying definition, there are
commonalities that can be observed across its various strands. Therefore, it is
possible to categorize new materialism into several broad classes based on their
similarities and differences. The following section primarily follows the typology
of new materialisms as outlined by Gamble et al [26].
3.1
Types of New Materialism
Vital new materialism This perspective, also known as materialist vitalism,
represents the most widely recognized type of new materialism, often overshad-
owing others [9]. It places emphasis on the intrinsic vitality and agency of mat-
ter, challenging conventional notions that depict matter as passive or inert. It
emerged from Gilles Deleuze’s interpretation of Spinoza’s theory of contaus [15]
and Leibniz’s concept of vinculum substantiale [16]. This reading was adopted

by post-Deleuzian philosophers like Jane Bennett, who sought to move beyond
traditional materialist perspectives that treat matter as a passive object solely
influenced by external forces. Rather, vital new materialism emphasizes the im-
manent power or force within all of nature, suggesting that all matter, including
non-biological entities, possesses a form of vitality or dynamism [4].
This approach often draws on scientific theories and concepts to understand
the behavior and properties of matter, including its self-organizing tendencies
and emergent properties. Moreover, it aims to transcend the dualism of the ma-
terial and the ideal, striving for a post-Cartesian monological understanding of
emergent and generative materiality [9][3]. Vitalists also embrace what is referred
to as flat ontology, where no particular kind of entity or agency is privileged over
others in terms of their ontological status [5].
This approach to new materialism, however, presents a challenge due to its
reliance on a vague notion of “vital force” that permeates all things. The lit-
erature provides only imprecise definitions and lacks a clear typology for this
concept [33]. It is neither epistemologically constructed nor it adheres to a nat-
uralistic account of “reality.” Instead, it posits a sui generis ontology of forces,
which effectively straddles the boundary between idealism and materialism [29].
As such, it proves problematic for exploring the philosophy of Bayesian mechan-
ics and FEP, as they reject the adherence to any kind of non-physical entities
such as vital force or ´elan vital [48].
Negative new materialism Negative new materialism posits a view of the
matter as “non-relationally external to thought.” It is considered “negative”
because it refuses the relation between thought and matter [26]. Two primary
and yet fundamentally divergent approaches can be identified within negative
new materialism: “speculative realism,” as exemplified by Quentin Meillasoux,
and “object-oriented ontology” (OOO), as represented by Graham Harman.
Meillasoux’s approach maintains a strict division and independence between
matter (being) and thought (subjectivity), yet it posits that “thought can think
matter,” thereby equating materialism to rationalism [50]. It also diverges from
vitalist new materialism as it opposes any anthropomorphism or attribution of
vitality to being. Additionally, it restricts the capacity for thought to humans
(at least among known beings).
On the other hand, Graham Harman’s object-oriented ontology proposes a
view of reality as “forms wrapped inside forms,” leading to a new kind of “for-
malism” [31]. These essential forms exceed any anthropocentric meaning-making.
Moreover, they are “withdrawn” from materiality to the extent of denying the
existence of matter. As a result, it can be argued that object-oriented ontology
is not a genuine type of materialism. On the contrary, it may be more apt to
consider it as a form of immaterialism or even anti-realism [38].
The commitment to a kind of implicit dualism, as implied by the radical
discontinuity and disrelation between matter and thought without any natural-
istic explanation for the emergence of one from the other (as in Meillasoux’s
speculative realism) [41], and the advocacy for a deeply essentialist view of iden-

tity as fundamentally self-contained and “vacuum sealed,” (principally within
Graham Harman’s object-oriented ontology) [31], makes this particular strand
of new “materialism”, if it can be labeled as such, the least appealing for FEP.
A genuine FEP-based ontology must reject any discontinuity between matter
and subjectivity as FEP does not confer any uniqueness to cognitive or active
agents; the same mathematical technology applies equally to a whole range of
entities, from inert rocks to the brain [48][23]. Moreover, Markov blanket per-
forms intrinsically dynamic partitioning of state space, which is antithetical to
static essentialism of object-oriented ontology.
Performative new materialism Graham Harman in his book Immaterialism
[32] outlines ten “Axioms of New Materialism” (to contrast them with his own
version of immaterialism), but they might as well be listed as Ten Axioms of
Performative New Materialism, as they align with the description of this type
provided in Gamble et al. [26]. Among the ones particularly relevant to our
purposes are: (1) Everything occurs along continuous gradients. (2) What a
thing does is more significant than what it is. (3) Thought and the world never
exist separately, and therefore “intra-act” rather than interact. (4) Things are
multiple rather than singular. (5) The world is purely immanent.
Unlike non-performative approaches, performative new materialism, also known
as pedetic new materialism, radically undermines the separation between epis-
temology and ontology. In this approach, epistemology and ontology are seen
as mutually constitutive, resulting in an onto-epistemological understanding of
reality that is not limited to humans or cognitive agents [26].
Instead of focusing on static existence, performative materialism highlights
the process of materialization, wherein matter actively engages in shaping itself.
In other words, it is not about being, but becoming, in which matter literally
matters itself. It embraces a shift from a metaphysics of individualism to a
dynamics of relational becoming. In simpler terms, phenomena are doings, not
things [20][2][44].
This strand of new materialism overcomes the shortcomings of the approaches
mentioned above. Unlike vital new materialism, it does not rely on non-physical
vital forces. Furthermore, it fundamentally rejects the separability between thought
and matter, which distinguishes it from negative new materialism. This approach
holds great promise for developing a neo-materialistic account of the FEP, partic-
ularly due to its three interdependent theses that align with the key conceptual
assertions of FEP and Bayesian mechanics. The following section delves into
each of them, discussing their relation to FEP.

Performative New Materialism and Connections to
FEP
Indeterminate activity of matter In order to evade attributing the activity
of matter to static, predetermined, and essential forms, it is necessary to recog-
nize its fundamental indeterminacy. An indeterminate or pedetic entity is distinct

from both randomness and probability. Randomness is typically defined in terms
of equiprobable discrete possibilities, while probability distributions can be seen
as modulating pure randomness. Neither pure randomness nor probabilistic mo-
tion alone possess the capacity to be generative and performative. Instead, the
indeterminate movement of matter, facilitated by relational constraints within
possibility spaces (as discussed in the next section), generates metastable forma-
tions while simultaneously constraining possibilities for subsequent formations
[44]. Consequently, unlike random and probabilistic motions, this process is in-
herently historical. This aligns with the emergence of Markov blanket through
self-organization within an “active soup” [22].
Ongoing iterative process Performative new materialism views materializa-
tion as a never-ending iterative process, where the performative matter continu-
ally (re)define its limits and boundaries. This process is never final or complete.
However, it does not allow for unbounded and pure contingency either. The tra-
jectory of every materializing iterative process is constrained within the struc-
ture of its possibility space, which is itself intrinsically dynamic. Similarly, the
dynamism and constant updating of generative models and autonomous states
(comprising of internal and blanket states) can be seen as the subclass of the
broader and more fundamental notion of iterative processes.
Relationally self-caused objects In this perspective, matter is “fully re-
lational and immanently self-caused” [26]. Beyond bestowing a kind of self-
implication to performative matter, this view effectively dismantles the divi-
sion between ontology and ontological practice [8]. It enables examining both
the phenomenon and the process of modeling that phenomenon under the same
ontological (or rather, onto-epistemological) framework. This allows us to view
self-evidencing as an onto-epistemological process in which the probability of
sensory states can recursively be interpreted as the evidence for the agent’s own
existence. As Karl Friston remarks, “the model evidence is just the probability
of some (sensory) samples given you are what you are” [25].

Possibility Spaces
Manuel DeLanda’s notion of the structure of possibility spaces was first intro-
duced in his book Intensive Science, Virtual Philosophy [13] and further devel-
oped in Philosophy and Simulation [11]. It is inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s concept
of virtual multiplicity and relies on the distinction between actual and virtual,
as well as between properties and capacities. A knife has the property of being
sharp, which is always actual. However, it also possesses the capacity to cut,
which is potentially virtual. Capacities are inherently relational and binary, in-
volving both the ability to affect (to cut) and be affected (to be cut). Unlike its
always actual property of sharpness, the knife’s capacity to cut may or may not
be actualized. When the knife interacts with objects that have the capacity to be

cut, such as cheese or bread, its capacity to cut is realized. However, when deal-
ing with objects such as a solid block of titanium, this capacity to cut remains
virtual and unactualized. Furthermore, depending on the specific capacities of
the objects it interacts with, the knife possesses innumerable capacities, such as
the capacity to kill, carve, peel, and so on. It is crucial to understand that these
non-actualized virtualities are not any less real than manifested actualities. [14].
Another related term is the concept of tendency. Tendencies have the ability
to change the properties of a whole, even to the extent of altering its identity. For
example, an ice cube has a tendency to undergo a phase transition at a certain
temperature, leading to a change in its property from solid to liquid. Similar to
capacities, tendencies can be both real and unmanifested (virtual) [11].
For any system with a given state space, the collection of all tendencies (both
manifested and unmanifested) and capacities (both exercised and unexercised)
form the possibility space for that system. Each possibility space possesses a
distinct structure defined by a multiplicity. DeLanda defines multiplicity as “a
nested set of vector fields related to each other by symmetry-breaking bifur-
cations, together with the distributions of attractos which define each of its
embedded levels” [13].
The concept of singularity, as an intrinsically topological feature, forms the
foundation of attractors in chaos theory. These attractors have had a lasting
impact on complexity science by providing insights into the emergence of events,
forms, and structures in a mechanism-independent manner. Attractors can be
seen as singularities that guide trajectories in their vicinity, yet they do not
manifest directly within the physical system. Furthermore, the transition from
one attractor to another can be modeled by introducing perturbations or shocks,
which involve varying a parameter of the model [40].
Singularities (or attractors), which are always virtual, play a significant role
within the multiplicity. As mentioned above, trajectories within the system
asymptotically approach attractors but never pass through them, thereby never
rendering them actual. Rather, attractors characterize the evolution of (actu-
alized) trajectories through the state space. Nevertheless, in accordance with
Alexander’s dictum (“to exist is to have causal powers”)[7], attractors are con-
sidered real despite their virtuality.
Different topological forms of attractors have been identified. The state spaces
of linear systems are typically structured by point attractors, whereas that of
nonlinear equations can exhibit multiple attractors of various types. A point
attractor indicates a tendency towards a steady state, while limit cycles represent
stable oscillations. In linear systems, the tendency to approach an attractor is
entirely deterministic, allowing the state of a process at any given time to be
theoretically deduced from knowledge of the state space structure. However, in
state spaces with multiple attractors, each having its own basin of attraction,
the state of a process at any moment depends not only on the equations but also
on the historical path the process has followed. As a result, it cannot be solely
deduced from the equations. Even if two trajectories start from infinitesimally

close initial conditions, they can end up in entirely different basins of attractions
[12].
Moreover, identical topologies and distributions of singularities can emerge in
distinct physical processes that may lack apparent similarities or commonalities
in terms of their mechanisms. This mechanism-independence is clearly illustrated
by the Lorenz system, where the three differential equations governing the dy-
namics of the system, comprising what is known as the Lorenz attractor, do not
depend on the specific physical properties or mechanisms of chaotic events. Con-
sequently, a wide range of complex phenomena, including those in atmospheric,
physiological, economic, ecological, and other domains, can be effectively mod-
eled using the same equations. Complexity scientists have consequently coined
the term critical universality to describe this phenomenon [40][6].
A proper treatment of the modal ontology of possibility spaces requires an
extensive and sustained philosophical argument, which is beyond the scope of this
paper (see, e.g., [13]). Nonetheless, it is worth noting a few related points. The
structure of a possibility space can be likened to “enabling constraints,” a concept
reminiscent of Gibsonian affordances [27] as well as Alicia Juarrero’s notion
of “causality as constraint” [35]. This idea of freedom within constraints also
resonates with the ideas of complexity theorist Edgar Morin, who emphasizes the
restrictions that complex adaptive systems impose on their elements as emergent
properties of the systems themselves [42][10]
DeLanda’s notion of possibility spaces becomes particularly relevant when
considering the function of Markov blankets in partitioning state spaces. It pro-
vides us with a framework to understand how an agent’s active and sensory
states shape the range of possibilities it can explore. This aligns with the classi-
cal view of active inference regarding individuation, cognitive niche construction,
and enculturation. Moreover, it entails an epistemological shift from focusing
solely on an agent’s internal structure and cognitive attitudes to considering the
constraints that influence the agent’s behavior.
The concept of Markov blanket is crucial in understanding embedded norma-
tivity as well. This concept suggests that normativity is not solely a property of
the landscapes agents experience but also a property of the agents themselves,
arising from their ability to set and pursue goals. Embedded normativity implies
that normativity can operate extrinsically, regulating the intrinsic metabolic and
modulatory normativity of autonomous agents, and organizing the way human
agents acquire norms. In simpler terms, normativity can both influence the agent
from the outside (through the environment) and exist internally as part of the
agent’s internal model of the world.
In the context of active inference and the FEP, the boundary between in-
side and outside typically refers to the statistical boundaries of the active agent.
However, defining the precise boundary of an agent is not straightforward. For
instance, traditionally cognition was considered to reside solely within the brain,
with the rest of the world being its object. However, the parity principle chal-
lenges this view, suggesting that if a part of the world functions as a process
that, if it occurred within the brain, would be recognized as part of the cognitive

9
process, then that part of the world should be considered part of the cognitive
process as well [39]. Future papers will explore this idea further by showing how
viewing agents as assemblages (in the technical sense used in assemblage theory)
can provide new insights into the relationship between an agent and its interface
with the possibility spaces.
The structure of possibility spaces can also be extended to encompass the
structure of scientific theories as well. Instead of being a single monolithic model,
a scientific theory can be understood as a “population of models” consisting of
interconnected families of models [28]. Some of these models play more foun-
dational roles, while others branch off from them. In this heterogeneous popu-
lation, most members are causal models that convey information about causal
relationships between events. However, a smaller number of models represent
quasi-causal relations between singularities [13].
In other words, the bulk of the population of models making up a scientific
theory interfaces with actual world, whereas a smaller subset interfaces with the
virtual world. The virtual aspect represents what Deleuze describes as “true” or
well-posed problems. According to him, “the virtual possesses the reality of a
task to be performed or a problem to be solved” [46], with each distinct solution
enabled by the actual part of the theory. For instance, as Deleuze notes, “an
organism is nothing if not the solution to a problem.” [46]. To further illustrate
this, consider the shared “problem” faced by the molecules in soap bubbles and
salt crystals: finding a point of minimal energy. The solution, however, manifests
differently in each case. The molecules in a soap bubble collectively behave to
minimize surface tension, while the molecules in a salt crystal minimize bonding
energy.
Therefore, the virtual component of a given scientific theory (e.g., fundamen-
tal laws, variational principles, etc.) is not falsifiable per se, unlike the actual
component which acquires falsifiability through its status as (correct or incor-
rect) solutions to the problems posed by the virtual. This perspective provides
yet another solution to the misguided criticism of FEP as being “unfalsifiable,”
as well as to the “map-territory fallacy” fallacy [1][47].

Intra-Action and Agential Realism
Intra-action, a term coined by Karen Barad and to some extent echoing John
Dewey’s concept of trans-action [17], is a key concept in performative new ma-
terialism. It emphasizes a dynamic relational perspective that goes beyond the
traditional realism versus relativism debate. Intra-action challenges the con-
ventional notion of individual entities acting upon each other from a distance,
proposing instead a process of co-constitutive emergence where “observed ob-
jects” are fundamentally inseparable from the “agencies of observation” [2]. Im-
portantly, in this context, the term agency does not refer to a static attribute
possessed by someone or something. Rather, it denotes the enactment of a pro-
cessual reconfiguration of the world [20]. In this sense, agency is understood as
both tracing the possibility space and actively participating in its ongoing recon-

figuration. Matter, on the other hand, is described as a “congealing of agency”
[20], a continual process of stabilizing and destabilizing through iterative intra-
activity.
In the context of active inference and the FEP, intra-action can be seen as
referring to the dynamic processes in which the agent and its environment ac-
tively shape one another. Rather than passively receiving information, the agent
engages in active inference to generate beliefs about the environment based on
sensory inputs. These beliefs then guide the agent’s actions, which can in turn
modify the environment and consequently alter the sensory inputs it receives.
This ongoing cycle of inference and action can be understood as a form of intra-
action, highlighting the continuous co-constitution of the agent and its environ-
ment.
Barad’s agential realism is heavily inspired by Niels Bohr’s philosophy-physics
(even though it has received some criticisms due to its insufficient faithfulness
to Bohr’s ideas [18]). In Bohrian philosophy-physics, phenomena, which are the
dynamic relationship between the observed physical phenomenon and the mea-
suring apparatus, are not separate from reality but rather constitute it, emerging
through the inseparable intra-activity of agencies. The apparatus, in this context,
is not a passive instrument but a dynamic entity that actively participates in
the production of phenomena [2]. It serves as a material practice that constantly
reconfigures the boundaries and properties of agencies-within-phenomena. This
perspective aligns with the FEP’s understanding of the agent as self-organizing
systems that forms beliefs about the causal origins of sensory states in the envi-
ronment, providing evidence for their own existence.
In addition, active inference is inherently perspectival, as it involves mak-
ing sense of and engaging with the world from a specific point of view. This
perspective-taking aligns with Barad’s agential realism, which emphasizes the
mutual constitution of subjects and objects. Similarly, in active inference, the
subject (the agent) and the object (the environment) are not independent en-
tities but continually co-constitute each other through their mutual probabilis-
tic tracking of each other. Furthermore, just as intra-action highlights the mu-
tual constitution of entities across different scales, active inference operates over
nested timescales to maximize model evidence. This multi-scale perspective un-
derscores the dynamic and relational nature of systems within the framework of
the FEP, resonating with the intra-active understanding of reality.
As for its epistemological stance, Barad’s position presents a challenge to
absolutism while still retaining the potential for objectivity. It proposes a form
of relationalism that goes beyond reconciling realism and relativism, instead of-
fering resources to transcend the debate by rejecting the notion of separateness.
Intra-action, as the core of this perspective, serves as a key tool for understand-
ing and navigating these discussions. Barad’s perspective on objectivity stems
from a view of referentiality that results from the intra-active perspective. As
Matz Hammarstr¨om notes, in this view, “the objective referent [is] the phe-
nomenon... and not a pre-existing object.” [30]. This perspective aligns with a
form of constructivism that is relationalist rather than relativist. While it agrees

with relativism in rejecting absolute conception of reality, it goes beyond the
typical emphasis on the constitutive role of the subjectivity. “Instead it shares
and, through its post-humanist stance, radicalizes Dewey’s trans-actional idea
of the entanglement of the organism-in-environment-as-a-whole.” [30].
It is crucial to emphasize that, in this perspective, as Hammarstr¨om observes,
“[t]he measurement (the preception) does not create the ‘object’; it is not the
human subject that measures the world into existence. Through our percep-
tions/measurements we (and other forms of existence) actualize some of the
[virtualities of possibility spaces]. A measurement does not measure something
non-existent into into existence; it actualizes one of the existing [virtualities] of
the perceptible” [30].

Conclusion and Future Research
In conclusion, this paper has introduced several essential conceptual tools to con-
struct a neo-materialistic account of FEP. It examined different types of New
Materialisms in relation to the FEP and argued that performative new mate-
rialism may be the most compatible strand of New Materialism for examining
FEP. Furthermore, the concept of possibility spaces has been introduced, em-
phasizing its relevance to some of the key aspects of FEP, particularly the notion
of Markov blanket as defining and continually updating the boundaries within
possibility space has been discussed. In this context, the concept of embedded
normativity has been explored as well, suggesting that normativity is not just
a property of the landscapes that agents experience but also a property of the
agents themselves. Finally, the paper has delved into the concept of intra-action
and agential realism, highlighting their alignment with the FEP and active in-
ference, and emphasizing the dynamic and relational perspective in which the
agent and its environment mutually constitute each other.
Subsequent papers in this series will systematically elaborate on the details of
the neo-materialistic account of the FEP, building upon the introduced concepts.
They will provide a comprehensive account of agents as assemblages and explore
the implications of this perspective for active inference and the FEP. Further-
more, they will offer a more extensive description and typology of intra-active
agents, drawing insights from kinetic materialism.
Future research can further explore these concepts and their implications for
our understanding of cognition and behavior. It would be interesting to explore
how the concept of intra-action can be applied to other areas of cognitive science
and neuroscience, and how the ideas of possibility spaces and embedded norma-
tivity can be further developed and operationalized. Additionally, the role of the
Markov blanket in defining and updating the boundaries of cognitive agents can
be examined in more detail, potentially leading to new insights into the nature
of cognition and the relationship between the brain and its environment.
