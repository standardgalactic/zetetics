D Lines
The D lines are pair of closely spaced lines in the emission spectrum
of alkali metal atoms. They arise from the transition 2P3/2 - 2S1/2 and
2P1/2 - 2S1/2 (Figure D.1). The resulting splitting arises from the
spin–orbit coupling in the p1 configuration. In sodium they diﬀer in
wavenumber by 17 cm1.
d–d Transition
A d–d transition is a transition of the electron between d orbitals
in a d-metal complex in which the degeneracy of the orbital has
been removed by the ligand field. In an octahedral complex the
transition is typically eg - t2g (Figure D.2). That transition is symmetry-
forbidden but acquires intensity from an antisymmetric vibration of
the complex, which destroys the centre of symmetry. It is therefore an

Two sets of linear combination of the orbitals shown in Figure D.3
can be formed such that all five of each set have the same shape.
One such linear combination is shown in Figure D.4. All five of this
set lie along the edges of the double pentagonal pyramid shown in
the illustration, which lie at 41.798 to the vertical through the shared
apex.
d Orbital
A d orbital is a molecular orbital that is formed by the face-to-face
overlap of two d orbitals and which when viewed along the inter-
nuclear axis resembles a d orbital. A d orbital contributes to a quad-
ruple bond, which has the composition s2p4d2 (Figure D.5).
Daniell Cell
A Daniell cell is a galvanic cell of structure Zn(s)|ZnSO4(aq)|CuSO4(aq)|
Cu(s). In laboratory studies it would be Zn(s)|ZnSO4(aq)||CuSO4(aq)|Cu(s)
with a salt bridge to eliminate the junction potential.
Davisson–Germer Experiment
The Davisson–Germer experiment is the observation of the diﬀraction
of electrons from layers of atoms in a nickel crystal. The experiment

de Broglie Relation
The de Broglie relation states that a particle travelling with linear
momentum p has a wavelength l given by
l ¼ h
p
where h is Planck’s constant. The relation is justified by the Schrödinger
equation, with l identified with the wavelength of the wavefunction of a
free particle. A consequence is that the wavelength of a particle of mass

debye (the unit)
The unit debye, D, is a non-SI unit widely used to report the electric
dipole moment of a molecule: 1 D E 3.335 64  1030 C m. The ori-
ginal definition was that 1 D was the magnitude of the dipole moment
of charges þ1 esu and 1 esu separated by 1 Å (1 Å ¼ 1010 m).
Debye–Hückel Limiting Law
The Debye–Hückel limiting law is an expression for the mean activity

from the limiting law occur even at low ionic strengths. A better fit
to observation is obtained with the empirically inspired Davies
equation:

The limiting law is based on a model of the ionic solution in which an
ionic atmosphere of opposite charge surrounds each ion as result of
the competition between the attracting eﬀect of the charge of the
central ion and the dispersing eﬀect of thermal motion. The charge of
the atmosphere lowers the potential energy of the central ion and
therefore its chemical potential. The eﬀect of the atmosphere is
equivalent to a single point charge at the distance rD, the Debye length,
from the central ion (Figure D.6), where
rD ¼

The eﬀect of the ionic atmosphere is to change the Coulomb potential
due to the central ion to a shielded Coulomb potential with shielding
length l equal to rD.

are two contributions. One is the relaxation eﬀect, in which the ionic
atmosphere becomes asymmetric and the displacement of its centre
of charge from the ion exerts a retarding force. The other is the
electrophoretic eﬀect, the retarding eﬀect of moving the entire unit of
central ion and its atmosphere through the solution.

Debye–Scherrer Method
The Debye–Scherrer method in X-ray diﬀraction employs a mono-
chromatic beam of X-rays and a powdered solid, initially in a capillary
tube and recorded photographically but now spread on a flat plate
and recorded electronically.
Degeneracy
A level is degenerate if two or more states have the same energy. De-
generacy can normally be traced to a symmetry of the system that
allows the wavefunctions of degenerate states to be converted into one
another by a symmetry operation (Figure D.7). It follows from group
theoretical arguments that the maximum degeneracy of a level of a
system (such as a molecule) is equal to the largest character for the
identity operation in the character table of the system’s point group.
Thus, a molecule with C5 symmetry can have levels that are no more
than twofold degenerate, and a molecule with octahedral symmetry
can have levels that are no more than threefold degenerate.
In certain cases, degeneracy exists even though superficial in-
spection of the system does not reveal the presence of symmetry op-
erations able to interrelate wavefunctions. The exact (rather than
merely numerically similar) degeneracies are then classified as acci-
dental. One example of accidental degeneracy is provided by a hy-
drogenic atom, in which all orbitals with the same principal quantum
number have the same energy. Another is the degeneracy of the states
of a particle in a rectangular box with the sides in various rational
proportions (Figure D.8). A third is the high degeneracy of the states
of a particle in an equilateral triangular region. However, in such
cases deeper inspection of the system shows the presence of a hidden
symmetry that interrelates the wavefunctions. The illustration shows
the internal rotations that account for the double degeneracy of
the level of energy 5h2/8mL2 in a rectangular well corresponding to
Figure D.7
A simple twofold degeneracy.

the states {nX,nY} ¼ {1,4} and {2,2} with one side that is twice as long as
the other side. The accidental degeneracy of a hydrogenic atom is due
to the SO4 symmetry of the Coulomb potential (its rotational sym-
metry in four dimensions).
Delocalization Energy
The delocalization energy Edeloc of conjugated hydrocarbon is the dif-
ference between the calculated energy of the p electrons, Ep, and the
sum of its N individual localized bonds:
Edeloc ¼ Ep  NE local
p
For butadiene, Edeloc ¼ 0.48|b|; for benzene Edeloc ¼ 2|b|.
Density Functional Theory
Density functional theory (DFT) is a procedure for the calculation of
the electronic structures of molecules which focusses directly on the
electron density, r(r), rather than on the wavefunction. In math-
ematics a functional is a function of a function. Although the energy
depends on quantum mechanical aspects of the electron distri-
bution, such as electron exchange, according to the Hohenberg–Kohn
theorem, the energy can be expressed solely in terms of the electron
density, a classical concept. Thus, the energy, E, of a molecule is a
functional in the sense that it can be expressed as a function of the
electron density, which itself is a function of position, and is written
E[r]. When expressed in terms of the wavefunction c(r) but with
the electron density r(r) ¼ 2|c(r)|2 in mind, the Schrodinger equation
becomes the Kohn–Sham equation, which for a two-electron mol-
ecule is

ð r(r2)
r12
c(r1)dt2 þ VXC(r1)c(r1) ¼ ec(r1)

the exchange–correlation potential, and is defined so that if there is a

change in electron density dr(r) in the molecule, then the resulting
change in energy due to electron exchange is
dEXC[r] ¼
ð
VXC(r)dr(r)dt
The varieties of approach to the DFT procedure (which involves a self-
consistent field approach to the numerical solution of the Kohn–
Sham equation) are distinguished by the choice of an expression for
the exchange–correlation potential. One approach uses a model of a
uniform electron gas, in which case
EXC[r] ¼ A

r(r)4=3dt;
A ¼  9e2(3=p)1=2

Other expressions have been developed that lead to results in accord
with a variety of experimental measurements.
Density of States
The density of states, r, is the number of states in a small range of
energies divided by the width of the energy of the range: r ¼ dN/dE
(Figure D.9). In other words, the number of states between E and
E þ dE is rdE, with r evaluated at E.
Depolarization Ratio
The depolarization ratio, r, of a line in a Raman spectrum is the ratio
of the intensities of scattered radiation with polarization per-
pendicular and parallel to the plane of polarization of the incident
radiation (Figure D.10):
r ¼ I>

A line is classified as depolarized if r is greater than about 0.75.
A general rule is that only totally symmetrical vibrations give rise to
polarized lines.
Dialysis
The process of dialysis is the removal of small molecules and ions
from solution that also contains macromolecules or colloidal par-
ticles by using a membrane that allows the passage of only the smaller
molecules. The process is accelerated in electrodialysis, which is dia-
lysis in the presence of an electric field.
Diamagnetism
A diamagnetic substance is one with a negative magnetic suscepti-
bility. Diamagnetic substances tend to move out of a magnetic field.
The magnetic flux density inside a diamagnetic substance is less than
in a vacuum. All substances have a diamagnetic contribution to their
total magnetic susceptibility. It arises from the generation of elec-
tronic currents which give rise to a magnetic field that opposes the
applied field. In certain cases, especially when a molecule has low-
lying excited states, the induced current runs in the opposite direction
and augments the applied field, giving rise to temperature-independent
paramagnetism (TIP).
Diathermic
A diathermic boundary is a boundary that permits the passage of
energy (as heat) when there is a temperature diﬀerence across it.

Diatomic Molecules
Schematic molecular orbital energy level diagrams for homonuclear
diatomic molecules of Period 2 are shown in Figure D.11, with the
uppermost filled orbital (the HOMO) labelled for each species. The
change in the diagram between Groups 15 and 16 arises from the
changing separation of the atomic s and p orbitals: when the separ-
ation is large, they may be treated separately (qualitatively, at least)
but not when the separation is small.
Diﬀraction
Diﬀraction is the interference that occurs between waves due to an
object in their path. The resulting pattern of intensity is called the dif-
fraction pattern. Diﬀraction occurs when the dimensions of the dif-
fracting object or its detailed structure are comparable to the wavelength
of the radiation. The diﬀraction pattern arising from light incident on a
screen with two slits is illustrated in Figure D.12. Diﬀraction from a

stack of semitransparent planes is the basis of Bragg’s law of diﬀraction,
which was used in early X-ray crystallography.
Diﬀusion
Diﬀusion is the migration of particles down a concentration gradient.
Fick’s first law of diﬀusion states that the flux, J, the number of mol-
ecules passing through a window perpendicular to the flow in an
interval divided by the area of the window and the length of the
interval (colloquially, ‘the number passing per unit area per unit
time’), is proportional to the concentration gradient:
Jx ¼  D @N
@x
In this expression, N is the number density (the number of molecules
in a region divided by the volume of the region) and the constant
of proportionality, D, is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Note that Jx40
(flow towards positive x) if the concentration gradient is negative
(down, towards positive x). Fick’s second law of diﬀusion, which is now
almost universally referred to as the diﬀusion equation, expresses the
rate of change of concentration in a region as
@N
@t ¼ D @2N
@x2
The three-dimensional versions of these equations are similar:
J ¼  DrN ;
@N
@t ¼ Dr2N ¼  r  J
If convection, the motion of a streaming fluid, also occurs, then the
diﬀusion equation becomes the generalized diﬀusion equation:
1D : @N
@t ¼ D @2N
@x2  v @N
@x ;
3D : @N
@t ¼  r  J  v  rN
where v is the velocity of convective flow. Finally, if chemical reaction
takes place, then a term representing the appearance or disappear-
ance of a substance must be included. The resulting equation is called
the material balance equation. Thus, if a substance with number
density N disappears by a first-order reaction with rate constant kr,
the material balance equation in one dimension is
@N
@t ¼ D @2N

Analytical solutions of these equations subject to a variety of
boundary and initial conditions are available. Thus, for a solution in
which the solute J is initially present as an amount n (and therefore
number nNA) in a thin layer of area A, then after a time t its con-
centration profile is
[J](x; t) ¼ nex2=4Dt

The corresponding concentration distribution when J is removed by a
first-order reaction is
[J] (x; t) ¼ kr

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be interpreted in terms of various properties
of the solute and the solution. For the self-diﬀusion of gas molecules (the
migration of a gas molecule into regions of lower concentration in a
nonuniform sample of a single gas), kinetic theory gives
D ¼ 1
3 lvmean
where l is the mean free path and vmean is the mean speed of the
molecules. Thus, D increases with temperature and decreases as the
sample is compressed isothermally (and the mean free path is thereby
reduced). In solution, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is related to the tem-
perature and characteristics of the solution by the Stokes–Einstein
equation
D ¼ kT
f
where f is the frictional coeﬃcient, the constant of proportionality
between the retarding force it experiences and its speed through the
solution. If the molecule obeys Stokes’ law, that the retarding force is
equal to 6pZav, where Z the viscosity and a is its hydrodynamic radius,
then
D ¼
kT
6pZa
If diﬀusion is regarded as a random walk in which the particle jumps
through a distance l in a time t, then the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given
by the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation:
D ¼ l2

A model-free result is that, provided diﬀusion is an activated process,
the temperature dependence of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient over a mod-
erate range is
D(T) ¼ D0eEa=RT
where Ea is the activation energy and D0 is a constant. See viscosity.
Diﬀusion-controlled Reaction
A reaction in solution can be regarded as the outcome of two stages.
One is the encounter of the two reactant species. That encounter is
followed by the activated reaction itself. If the rate-determining step is
the former, the reaction is termed diﬀusion-controlled; if the latter step
is rate-determining, the reaction is activation controlled. In a dif-
fusion-controlled second-order reaction
v ¼ kr[A][B];
kr ¼ 4pR DNA;
D ¼ DA þ DB
where R* is the separation of A and B at which reaction occurs. If A
and B obey the Stokes–Einstein equation for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
then
kr ¼ 8RT

where Z is the viscosity of the medium. This result suggests that the
rate constant depends on the properties of the medium and is in-
dependent of the size of the reactants.

Direct and Complex Reaction
In a direct reaction of the form A þ BC - AB þ C, the replacement of C
by A takes place very quickly by an immediate exchange as soon as the
reactants come within reactive range. In a complex reaction, the ABC
cluster survives for a period before ejecting C.
Direct Method
The direct method of analyzing X-ray diﬀraction data is a statistical
procedure for tackling the phase problem by computing the prob-
abilities that phases have specific values.
Dislocation
A dislocation in a crystal is a discontinuity in the regularity of the
lattice. In a screw dislocation (Figure D.14) the unit cells in one region
are pushed up relative to those in a neighbouring region. The result is
a path encircling an axis and forming a continuous spiral.
Dispersion
The dispersion of a property, such as refractive index, is its variation
with frequency (see polarizability).

Donnan Equilibrium
The Donnan equilibrium is the distribution of ions in two compart-
ments connected by a semipermeable membrane on one side of
which there is a polyelectrolyte. If a polyelectrolyte MnP is present in
the compartment L at a concentration [MnP] and a salt MX is added to
both compartments L and R, then at equilibrium the concentrations
of the ions are

Doppler Eﬀect
In the Doppler eﬀect, radiation (electromagnetic or sonic) is shifted in

where c is the speed of light (or sound) and v is the speed of the

spectral line broadening called Doppler broadening. This broadening
arises because in the gas molecules have a wide range of velocities
and hence the absorption and emission frequencies are spread over
corresponding range of Doppler shifted frequencies. When the tem-
perature is T the width of the Doppler broadened line at half height is

equation, l ¼ h/p, by which a wavelength is ascribed to a particle with
nonzero linear momentum. Experimental evidence for duality includes
the diﬀraction of particles and the photoelectric eﬀect.
Dulong and Petit’s Law
According to Dulong and Petit’s law, all monatomic nonmetallic solids
should have a molar heat capacity equal to 3R. This value would be
obtained by the atoms acting as classical oscillators, but due to their
quantized character, not all vibrations can be stimulated at low
temperatures, so the molar heat capacity falls below 3R. See heat
capacity.
