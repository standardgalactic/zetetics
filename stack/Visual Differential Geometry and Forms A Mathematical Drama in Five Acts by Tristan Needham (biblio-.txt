Prologue
The Faustian Offer
Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil
says: “I will give you this powerful machine, and it will answer any
question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up
geometry and you will have this marvellous machine.” . . . the danger
to our soul is there, because when you pass over into algebraic calcu-
lation, essentially you stop thinking: you stop thinking geometrically,
you stop thinking about the meaning.
Sir Michael Atiyah1
“Differential Geometry” contains the word “Geometry.”
A tautology? Well, the undergraduate who ﬁrst opens up the assigned textbook on the sub-
ject may care to disagree! In place of geometry, our hapless student is instead confronted with a
profusion of formulas, and their proofs consist of lengthy and opaque computations. Adding insult
to injury, these computations are frequently ugly, involving a “debauch of indices”2—a phrase
coined by Élie Cartan (one of the principal heroes of our drama) in 1928. If the student is honest
and brave, the professor may be forced to confront an embarrassingly blunt question: “Where has
the geometry gone?!”
Now, truth be told, most modern texts do in fact contain many pictures, usually of computer-
generated curves and surfaces. But, with few exceptions, these pictures are of speciﬁc, concrete
examples, which merely illustrate theorems whose proofs rest entirely upon symbolic manipula-
tion. In and of themselves, these pictures explain nothing!
The present book has two distinct and equally ambitious objectives, the ﬁrst of which is the
subject of the ﬁrst four Acts—to put the “Geometry” back into introductory “Differential Geo-
metry.” The 235 hand-drawn diagrams contained in the pages that follow are qualitatively and
fundamentally of a different character than mere computer-generated examples. They are the con-
ceptual fruits of many years of intermittent but intense effort—they are the visual embodiment of
intuitive geometric explanations of stunning geometric facts.
The words I wrote in the Preface to VCA3 apply equally well now: “A signiﬁcant proportion
of the geometric observations and arguments contained in this book are, to the best of my knowl-
edge, new. I have not drawn attention to this in the text itself as this would have served no useful
purpose: students don’t need to know, and experts will know without being told. However, in
cases where an idea is clearly unusual but I am aware of it having been published by someone
else, I have tried to give credit where credit is due.” In addition, I have attributed exercises that
appear to be original, but that are not of my making.
On a personal note (but with a serious mathematical point to follow), the roots of the
present endeavour can be traced back decades, to my youth. The story amounts to a tale of two
books.

2The full quotation begins to reveal Cartan’s heroic stature: “The utility of the absolute differential calculus of Ricci and Levi-
Civita must be tempered by an avoidance of excessively formal calculations, where the debauch of indices disguises an often
very simple geometric reality. It is this reality that I have sought to reveal.” (From the preface to Cartan 1928.)

I shall adopt the compact conceit of referring to it simply as VCA.

Prologue
The ﬁrst book ignited my profound fascination with Differential Geometry and with Einstein’s
General Theory of Relativity. Perhaps the experience was so intense because it was my ﬁrst love;
I was 19 years old. One day, at the end of my ﬁrst year of studying physics at Merton College,
Oxford, I stumbled upon a colossal black book in the bowels of Blackwell’s bookshop. Though I
did not know it then, the 1,217-page tome was euphemistically referred to by relativity theorists
as “The Bible.” Perhaps it is appropriate, then, that this remarkable work altered the entire course
of my life. Had I not read Gravitation (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler 1973), I would never have had
the opportunity4 to study under (and become lifelong friends with) Roger Penrose, who in turn
fundamentally transformed my understanding of mathematics and of physics.
In the summer of 1982, having been intrigued by the mathematical glimpses contained in
Westfall’s (1980) excellent biography of Newton, I made an intense study of Newton’s (1687) mas-
terpiece, Philosophæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, usually referred to simply as the Principia.
This was the second book that fundamentally altered my life. While V. I. Arnol’d5 and S. Chan-
drasekhar (1995) sought to lay bare the remarkable nature of Newton’s results in the Principia, the
present book instead arose out of a fascination with Newton’s methods.
As we have discussed elsewhere,6 Newtonian scholars have painstakingly dismantled the
pernicious myth7 that the results in the 1687 Principia were ﬁrst derived by Newton using his
original 1665 version of the calculus, and only later recast into the geometrical form that we ﬁnd
in the ﬁnished work.
Instead, it is now understood that by the mid-1670s, having studied Apollonius, Pappus, and
Huygens, in particular, the mature Newton became disenchanted with the form in which he had
originally discovered the calculus in his youth—which is different again from the Leibnizian form
we all learn in college today—and had instead embraced purely geometrical methods.
Thus it came to pass that by the 1680s Newton’s algebraic infatuation with power series gave
way to a new form of calculus—what he called the “synthetic method of ﬂuxions”8—in which
the geometry of the Ancients was transmogriﬁed and reanimated by its application to shrinking
geometrical ﬁgures in their moment of vanishing. This is the potent but nonalgorithmic form of
calculus that we ﬁnd in full ﬂower in his great Principia of 1687.
Just as I did in VCA, I now wish to take full advantage of Newton’s approach throughout
this book. Let me therefore immediately spell it out, and in signiﬁcantly greater detail than I did
in VCA, in the vain hope that this second book may inspire more mathematicians and physicists
to adopt Newton’s intuitive (yet rigorous9) methods than did my ﬁrst.
If two quantities A and B depend on a small quantity ϵ, and their ratio approaches unity as
ϵ approaches zero, then we shall avoid the more cumbersome language of limits by following
Newton’s precedent in the Principia, saying simply that, “A is ultimately equal to B.” Also, as we
did in earlier works (Needham 1993, 2014), we shall employ the symbol ≍to denote this concept
of ultimate equality.10 In short,
“A is ultimately equal to B”
⇐⇒
A ≍B
⇐⇒
lim
ϵ→0
A
B = 1.
4Years later I was privileged to meet with Wheeler several times, and to correspond with him, so I was ﬁnally able to thank
him directly for the impact that his Gravitation had had upon my life.

7Sadly, this myth originated with Newton himself, in the heat of his bitter priority battle with Leibniz over the discovery of
the calculus. See Arnol’d (1990), Bloye and Huggett (2011), de Gandt (1995), Guicciardini (1999), Newton (1687, p. 123), and

Prologue

It follows [exercise] from the theorems on limits that ultimate equality is an equivalence relation,
and that it also inherits additional properties of ordinary equality, e.g., X ≍Y & P ≍Q ⇒X · P ≍
Y · Q, and A ≍B · C ⇔(A/B) ≍C.
Before we begin to apply this idea in earnest, we also note that the jurisdiction of ultimate
equality can be extended naturally to things other than numbers, enabling one to say, for example,
that two triangles are “ultimately similar,” meaning that their angles are ultimately equal.
Having grasped Newton’s method, I immediately tried my own hand at using it to sim-
plify my teaching of introductory calculus, only later realizing how I might apply it to Complex
Analysis (in VCA), and now to Differential Geometry. Though I might choose any number of
simple, illustrative examples (see Needham 1993 for more), I will reuse the speciﬁc one I gave in
the preface to VCA, and for one simple reason: this time I will use the “ ≍”–notation to present
the argument rigorously, whereas in VCA I did not. Indeed, this example may be viewed as a
recipe for transforming most of VCA’s “explanations” into “proofs,”11 merely by sprinkling on the
requisite ≍s.
Let us show that if T = tan θ, then dT
dθ = 1 + T2. See ﬁgure below. If we increase θ by a small
(ultimately vanishing) amount δθ, then T will increase by the length of the vertical hypotenuse
δT of the small triangle, in which the other two sides of this triangle have been constructed to lie
in the directions (θ + δθ) and (θ + π
2 ), as illustrated. To obtain the result, we ﬁrst observe that in
the limit that δθ vanishes, the small triangle with hypotenuse δT is ultimately similar to the large
triangle with hypotenuse L, because ψ ≍π
2 . Next, as we see in the magnifying glass, the side δs
adjacent to θ in the small triangle is ultimately equal to the illustrated arc of the circle with radius
L, so δs ≍L δθ. Thus,
dT
L dθ ≍
δT
L δθ ≍δT
δs ≍L
1
=⇒
dT
dθ = L2 = 1 + T2.
So far as I know, Newton never wrote down this speciﬁc example, but compare the illumi-
nating directness of his style12 of geometrical reasoning with the unilluminating computations we
teach our students today, more than three centuries later! As Newton himself put it,13 the geomet-
ric method is to be preferred by virtue of the “clarity and brevity of the reasoning involved and
because of the simplicity of the conclusions and the illustrations required.” Indeed, Newton went
even further, resolving that only the synthetic method was “worthy of public utterance.”
11I was already using the ≍notation (both privately and in print) at the time of writing VCA, and, in hindsight, it was
a mistake that I did not employ it in that work; this led some to suppose that the arguments presented in VCA were less
rigorous than they actually were (and remain).
12The best ambassador for Newton’s approach will be you yourself. We therefore suggest that you immediately try your own
hand at Newtonian reasoning, by doing Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4, on page 24.

Prologue
Newton himself did not employ any symbol to represent his concept of “ultimate equality.”
Instead, his devotion to the geometrical method of the Ancients spilled over into emulating their
mode of expression, causing him to write out the words “ultimately have the ratio of equality,”
every single time the concept was invoked in a proof. As Newton (1687, p. 124) explained, the Prin-
cipia is “written in words at length in the manner of the Ancients.” Even when Newton claimed
that two ratios were ultimately equal, he insisted on expressing each ratio in words. As a result, I
myself was quite unable to follow Newton’s reasoning without ﬁrst transcribing and summariz-
ing each of his paragraphs into “modern” form (which was in fact already quite common in 1687).
Indeed, back in 1982, this was the catalyst for my private introduction and use of the symbol, ≍.
It is my view that Newton’s choice not to introduce a symbol for “ultimate equality” was a
tragically consequential error for the development of mathematics. As Leibniz’s symbolic calcu-
lus swept the world, Newton’s more penetrating geometrical method fell by the wayside. In the
intervening centuries only a handful of people ever sought to repair this damage and revive New-
ton’s approach, the most notable and distinguished recent champion having been V. I. Arnol’d14
(1937–2010).
Had Newton shed the trappings of this ancient mode of exposition and instead employed
some symbol (any symbol!) in place of the words “ultimately equal,” his dense, paragraph-length
proofs in the Principia might have been reduced to a few succinct lines, and his mode of thought
might still be widely employed today. Both VCA and this book are attempts to demonstrate, very
concretely, the continuing relevance and vitality of Newton’s geometrical approach, in areas of
mathematics whose discovery lay a century in the future at the time of his death in 1727.
Allow me to insert some ﬁne print concerning my use of the words “rigour” and “proof.”
Yes, my explicit use of Newtonian ultimate equalities in this work represents a quantum jump
in rigour, as compared to my exposition in VCA, but there will be some mathematicians who
will object (with justiﬁcation!) that even this increase in rigour is insufﬁcient, and that none of the
“proofs” in this work are worthy of that title, including the one just given: I did not actually prove
that the side of the triangle is ultimately equal to the arc of the circle.
I can offer no logical defence, but will merely repeat the words I wrote in the Preface of VCA,
more than two decades ago: “My book will no doubt be ﬂawed in many ways of which I am not
yet aware, but there is one ‘sin’ that I have intentionally committed, and for which I shall not
repent: many of the arguments are not rigorous, at least as they stand. This is a serious crime if
one believes that our mathematical theories are merely elaborate mental constructs, precariously
hoisted aloft. Then rigour becomes the nerve-racking balancing act that prevents the entire struc-
ture from crashing down around us. But suppose one believes, as I do, that our mathematical
theories are attempting to capture aspects of a robust Platonic world that is not of our making.
I would then contend that an initial lack of rigour is a small price to pay if it allows the reader
to see into this world more directly and pleasurably than would otherwise be possible.” So, to
preemptively address my critics, let me therefore concede, from the outset, that when I claim that
an assertion is “proved,” it may be read as, “proved beyond a reasonable doubt”!15
Separate and apart from the issue of rigour is the sad fact that in rethinking so much classical
mathematics I have almost certainly made mistakes: The blame for all such errors is mine, and
mine alone. But please do not blame my geometrical tools for such poor craftsmanship—I am
equally capable of making mistakes when performing symbolic computations! Corrections will be
received with gratitude at VDGF.correction@gmail.com.
The book can be fully understood without giving a second thought to the complete arc of
the unfolding drama, told as it is in ﬁve Acts. That said, I think that plot matters, and that the
book’s unorthodox structure and title are ﬁtting, for the following reasons. First, I have sought
14See, for example, Arnol’d (1990).
15Upon reading these words, a strongly supportive member of the Editorial Board of Princeton University Press suggested to
my editor that in place of “Q.E.D.,” I conclude each of my proofs with the letters, “P.B.R.D.”!

to present the ideas as dramatically as I myself see them, not only in terms of their historical
development,16 but also (more importantly) in terms of the cascading, interconnected ﬂow of the
ideas themselves, and their startling implications for the rest of mathematics and for physics.
Second, more by instinct than design, the role of each of the ﬁve Acts does indeed follow (more
or less) the classical structure of a Shakespearean drama; in particular, the anticipated “Climax” is
indeed Act III: “Curvature.” It was in fact years after I had begun work on the book that one day
it suddenly became clear to me that what I had been composing all along had been a mathematical
drama in ﬁve acts. That very day I “corrected” the title of the work, and correspondingly changed
its ﬁve former “Parts” into “Acts”:
•
Act I: The Nature of Space
•
Act II: The Metric
•
Act III: Curvature
•
Act IV: Parallel Transport
•
Act V: Forms
The ﬁrst four Acts fulﬁll the promise of a self-contained, geometrical introduction to Differen-
tial Geometry. Act IV is the true mathematical powerhouse that ﬁnally makes it possible to provide
geometric proofs of many of the assertions made in the ﬁrst three Acts.
Several aspects of the subject matter are as unorthodox (in a ﬁrst course) as the geometri-
cal methods by which they are treated. Here we shall describe only the three most important
examples.
First, the climax within the climax of Act III is the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem—a remarkable
link between local geometry and global topology. While the inclusion of this topic is standard,
our treatment of it is not. Indeed, we celebrate its centrality and fundamental importance with
an extravagant display of mathematical ﬁreworks: we devote ﬁve chapters to it, offering up four
quite distinct proofs, each one shedding new light on the result, and on the nature of Differential
Geometry itself.
Second, the transition (usually in graduate school) from 2-dimensional surfaces to n-
dimensional spaces (called “manifolds”) is often confusing and intimidating for students. Chap-
ter 29—the second longest chapter of the book—seeks to bridge this gap by focusing (initially) on
the curvature of 3-dimensional manifolds, which can be visualized; yet we frame the discussion
so as to apply to any number of dimensions. We use this approach to provide an intuitive, geo-
metrical, yet technically complete, introduction to the famous Riemann tensor, which measures the
curvature of an n-dimensional manifold.
Third, having committed to a full treatment of the Riemann tensor, we felt it would have
been immoral to have hidden from the reader its single greatest triumph in the arena of the nat-
ural world. We therefore conclude Act IV with a prolonged, geometrical introduction to Einstein’s
glorious General Theory of Relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature impressed upon 4-
dimensional spacetime by matter and energy. This is the third longest chapter of the book. Not
only does it treat (in complete geometrical detail) the famous Gravitational Field Equation (which
Einstein discovered in 1915) but it also explains some of the most recent and exciting discoveries
regarding its implications for black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology!
Now let us turn to Act V, which is quite different in character from the four Acts that precede
it, for it seeks to accomplish a second objective of the work, one that is quite distinct from the ﬁrst,
but no less ambitious.
Even the most rabid geometrical zealot must concede that Atiyah’s diabolical machine
(described in the opening quotation) is a necessary evil; but if we must calculate, let us at least
16As I did in VCA, I strongly recommend Stillwell’s (2010) masterpiece, Mathematics and Its History, as a companion to this
book, for it provides deeply insightful and detailed analysis of many historical developments that we can only touch on here.

Prologue
do so gracefully! Fortunately, starting in 1900, Élie Cartan developed a powerful and elegant new
method of computation, initially to investigate Lie Groups, but later to provide a new approach to
Differential Geometry.
Cartan’s discovery is called the “Exterior Calculus,” and the objects it studies and differen-
tiates and integrates are called “Differential Forms,” here abbreviated simply to Forms. We shall
ultimately follow Cartan’s lead, illustrating his method’s power and elegance in the ﬁnal chapter
of Act V—the longest chapter of the book—reproving symbolically results that were proven geometri-
cally in the ﬁrst four Acts. But Forms will carry us beyond what was possible in the ﬁrst four Acts:
in particular, they will provide a beautifully efﬁcient method of calculating the Riemann tensor of
an n-manifold, via its curvature 2-forms.
First, however, we shall fully develop Cartan’s ideas in their own right, providing a self-
contained introduction to Forms that is completely independent of the ﬁrst four Acts. Lest there be
any confusion, we repeat, the ﬁrst six chapters—out of seven—of Act V make no reference whatsoever
to Differential Geometry! We have done this because Forms ﬁnd fruitful applications across diverse
areas of mathematics, physics, and other disciplines. Our aim is to make Forms accessible to the widest
possible range of readers, even if their primary interest is not Differential Geometry.
To that end, we have sought to treat Forms much more intuitively and geometrically than is
customary. That said, the reader should be under no illusions: the principal purpose of Act V is
to construct, at the undergraduate level, the “Devil’s machine”—a remarkably powerful method of
computation.
The immense power of these Forms is reminiscent of the complex numbers: a tiny drop goes
in, and an ocean pours out—Cartan’s Forms explain vastly more than was asked of them by their
discoverer, a sure sign that he had hit upon Platonic Forms!
To give just one example, Forms unify and clarify all of Vector Calculus, in a way that would
be a revelation to undergraduates, if only they were permitted to see it. Indeed, Green’s Theorem,
Gauss’s Theorem, and Stokes’s Theorem are merely different manifestations of a single theorem
about Forms that is simpler than any of these special cases! Despite the indisputable importance of
Differential Forms across mathematics and physics, most undergraduates will leave college without
ever having seen them, and I have long considered this a scandal. Only a precious handful17 of
undergraduate textbooks (on either Vector Calculus or Differential Geometry) even mention their
existence, and they are instead relegated to graduate school.
This lamentable state of affairs is now well into its second century, and I see no signs of an
impending sea change. In response, Act V seeks not to curse the dark, but rather to light a candle,18
striving to convince the reader that Cartan’s Forms (and their underlying “tensors”) are as simple
as they are beautiful, and that they (and the name Cartan!) deserve to become a standard part
of the undergraduate curriculum. This is the brazenly ambitious goal of Act V. After drowning the
reader in pure Geometry for the ﬁrst four Acts, we hope that the computational aspect of this ﬁnal
Act may serve as a suitably cathartic dénouement!
Before we close, let us simply list some housekeeping details:
•
First, I have made no attempt write this book as a classroom textbook. While I hope that
some brave souls may nevertheless choose to use it for that purpose—as some previously did
with VCA—my primary goal has been to communicate a majestic and powerful subject to the
reader as honestly and as lucidly as I am able, regardless of whether that reader is a tender
neophyte, or a hardened expert.
17See Further Reading, at the end of this book.
18Ours is certainly not the ﬁrst such candle to be lit. Indeed, just as our work was nearing completion, Fortney (2018) published
an entire book devoted to this same goal. However, Fortney’s work does not include any discussion of Differential Geometry,
and, at 461 pages, Fortney’s book is considerably longer than the 100-page introduction to Forms contained in Act V of this
book.

My selection of topics may seem eclectic at times: for example, why is no attention paid to the
fascinating and important topic of minimal surfaces? Frequently, as in this case, it is for one
(or both) of the following two reasons: (1) our focus is on intrinsic geometry, not extrinsic19
geometry; (2) an excellent literature already exists on the subject; in such cases, I have tried to
provide useful pointers in the Further Reading section at the end of the book.

I have tried to make you, the reader, into an active participant in developing the ideas. For
example, as an argument progresses, I have frequently and deliberately placed a pair of logical
stepping stones sufﬁciently far apart that you may need to pause and stretch slightly to pass
from one to the next. Such places are marked “[exercise]”; they often require nothing more
than a simple calculation or a moment of reﬂection.
•
Last, we encourage the reader to take full advantage of the Index; its creation was a painful
labour of love!
We bring this Prologue to a close with a broader philosophical objective of the work, one that
transcends the speciﬁc mathematics we shall seek to explain.
One of the rights [sic] of passage from mathematical adolescence to adulthood is the ability
to distinguish true miracles from false miracles. Mathematics itself is replete with the former, but
examples of the latter also abound: “I can’t believe all those ugly terms cancelled and left me
such a beautifully simple answer!”; or, “I can’t believe that this complicated expression has such a
simple meaning!”
Rather than congratulating oneself in such a circumstance, one should instead hang one’s
head in shame. For if all those ugly terms cancelled, they should never have been there in the ﬁrst
place! And if that complicated expression has a wonderfully simple meaning, it should never have
been that complicated in the ﬁrst place!
In my own case, I am embarrassed to confess that mathematical puberty lasted well into my
20s, and I only started to grow up once I became a graduate student, thanks to the marvellous twin
inﬂuences of Penrose and of my close friend George Burnett-Stuart, a fellow advisee of Penrose.
The Platonic Forms of mathematical reality are always perfectly beautiful and they are always
perfectly simple; transient impressions to the contrary are manifestations of our own imperfection.
My hope is that this book may help nudge the reader towards humility in the face of this perfec-
tion, just as my two friends ﬁrst nudged me down this path, so many years ago amidst the surreal,
Escher-like spires of Oxford.

Roger Penrose transformed my understanding of mathematics and of physics. From the very
ﬁrst paper of his I ever read, when I was 20 years old, the perfection, beauty, and almost musi-
cal counterpoint of his ideas elicited in me a profound aesthetic exhilaration that I can only
liken to the experience of listening to the opening of Bach’s Cantata 101 or Beethoven’s Grosse
Fuge.
From the time that I was his student, Roger’s ability to unravel the deepest of mysteries
through geometry left an indelible mark—it instilled in me a lifelong, unshakable faith that a geo-
metric explanation must always exist. (My study of Newton’s Principia later served to deepen my
belief in the universality of the geometrical approach.) Without that faith, this work could not exist,
for it sometimes took me many years of groping before I discovered the geometric explanation of
a particular mathematical phenomenon.
To be able to count myself amongst Roger’s friends has been a great joy and a high honour
for 40 years, and my dedication of this imperfect work to Roger can scarcely repay the intellectual
debt that I owe to him, but it is the best that I can do.
In order to properly introduce the next person to whom I owe thanks, I am forced to reveal
a somewhat shabby detail about myself: when I ﬁrst came to America from England in 1989, I
smoked two packs of cigarettes per day! In 1995 I was ﬁnally able to quit: it was the hardest thing
I had ever done, and I would likely have failed, had it not been for the invention of the nicotine
patch.
Perhaps ﬁve years later, in response to the 1997 publication of my Visual Complex Analysis
(VCA), I received a “fan letter” from a medical researcher at Duke University; he planned to visit
the Bay Area and asked if we could meet. With some trepidation, I agreed. My visitor turned out to
be Professor Jed Rose, inventor of my (saviour) nicotine patch! Jed had started out in mathematics
and physics, and had never lost his love of those disciplines, but shrewdly calculated that he could
have a greater impact if he directed his energies to medical research, instead. I’m so glad that he
did!
Once I began work on VDGF (Visual Differential Geometry and Forms, this book) in 2011, Jed
became my most enthusiastic supporter, demonstrating great generosity in using funds from his
medical inventions to buy out some of my teaching, thereby greatly assisting my research for
VDGF. Every time Jed visited me and my family in California during the nine years of work
on the book, my spirits were lifted by Jed’s relentlessly upbeat personality and his belief in the
importance of what I was trying to accomplish. And, as the manuscript slowly evolved, Jed offered
a remarkably large number of detailed and helpful suggestions and corrections; the ﬁnished work
is signiﬁcantly better as a result of his helpful observations. Thus, as you see, Jed helped me in
three linearly independent directions, and I cannot thank him enough. And as if all this were not
enough, what started out as a purely intellectual relationship, subsequently blossomed into a very
warm and close friendship between our two families.
The next key person I would like to thank is Professor Thomas Banchoff, the distinguished
geometer of Brown University. During the writing of this book, I managed to arrange for Tom to
come to USF as a visiting scholar in two separate years, for one semester each. Tom was extremely
generous to me during both of those semesters, offering to read my evolving manuscript and
giving me extremely valuable feedback. Each week he would read the latest installment of the
manuscript, hot off the presses, and then he and I would meet in his ofﬁce each Friday afternoon,
and go over his detailed corrections and suggestions, written in red pen in the margins, line by

line. Although this partnership sadly ended when the book was only half done, I have adopted
essentially all of his helpful suggestions and corrections, and I am immensely grateful to him for
sharing his deep geometrical wisdom and expertise with me.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Wei Liu20 (a physicist specializing in optics
research, whom I hope to eventually meet, some ﬁne day). In 2019 he wrote to me to express his
appreciation of VCA, and he enclosed a research paper of his21 that cited my treatment of the
Poincaré–Hopf Theorem. This paper totally opened my eyes to how physicists continue to make
wonderful use of a beautiful result of Hopf that seems to have completely evaporated from all
mathematical textbooks. The result is the subject of Section 19.6.4, and it says this: The Poincaré–
Hopf Theorem not only applies to vector ﬁelds, but also to Hopf’s line ﬁelds,22 which greatly
generalize vector ﬁelds and which can have singular points with fractional indices. Witness the
examples shown in [19.14] on page 212. At my request, Dr. Liu then further assisted me by point-
ing out many other applications that physicists have made of Hopf’s ideas. I have in turn shared
his kind guidance with you, dear reader, in the Further Reading section at the end of the book.
In addition to the principal players above, I have received all manner of advice, support, and
suggestions from colleagues and friends, near and far.
My beloved brother Guy is an anchor whose love and faith in me is too often taken for
granted, but it should not be!
Stanley Nel and Paul Zeitz, my friends of 30 years, have always believed in me more than I
have believed in myself, and their encouragement has meant a great deal to me over the many
years it has taken to create this book, ﬁrst struggling to discover the needed geometrical insights,
then writing and drawing the book.
Douglas Hofstadter—whose Gödel, Escher, Bach transﬁxed me (and millions more) as an
undergraduate—has honoured me with his support for more than 20 years. First, he has repeat-
edly and forcefully promoted VCA, both in print and in interviews. Second, he read and
provided very valuable feedback on Needham (2014), which was ultimately incorporated into
this book.
Dr. Ed Catmull—co-founder with Steve Jobs of Pixar, and later president of both Pixar and
Walt Disney Animation Studios—wrote me a very ﬂattering email about VCA back in 1999. At
ﬁrst I was convinced that one of my the University of San Francisco (USF) maths-pals was playing
a practical joke on me, but the email was real. Ed invited me to visit the Pixar campus (still in Point
Richmond back in those days), gave me a guided tour of the studios, took me out to lunch, and
offered me a job! (I will leave it to the reader to assign a numerical value to my stupidity in turning
that offer down.) Though my contact with Ed has been sporadic, he has been a faithful bolsterer
of VCA (praising it in interviews he has done), he also wrote me a letter of recommendation for
a grant, and he has been very supportive of my effort to create VDGF. I deeply appreciate Ed’s
encouragement over the years, and I thank him for the extremely kind words on the back of this
book.
Professor Frank Morgan (whom I know by reputation only) was originally approached by
Princeton University Press to provide an anonymous review of the manuscript of VDGF. But when
he submitted his review to my editor, he also sent it to me directly, under his own name. I am
very grateful that he chose to do this, as it now allows me to thank him publicly for his concrete
suggestions and corrections. Furthermore, I was especially grateful for the tremendous boost his
report gave to my morale at the time. Finally, I offer him my sincerest thanks for being willing to
share his remarkably generous assessment of VDGF on the back of this book.

Finally, I am very grateful to Professor Henry Segerman for supplying me with the image of
his Topology Joke [18.8], page 191, and for granting me permission to reproduce it here.
This is my second book, and it is also my last book. I therefore wish to not only thank all those
who directly helped me create VDGF, listed above, but also those who inﬂuenced and supported
me much earlier in my life. Some of these people were so seamlessly integrated into the fabric of
my existence that they became invisible, and, shamefully, I failed to thank them properly in VCA;
now is my last chance to put things right.
First amongst these is Anthony Levy, my oldest friend, from our undergraduate days together
at Merton College, Oxford. Inexplicably, Anthony (or Tony, as I knew him then) believed in me
long before there was any evidence to support such a belief, and that continued belief in me
has buoyed me up repeatedly during periods of mathematical self-doubt over the decades. And,
beyond the world of pure intellect, Anthony’s sage advice and love have helped me navigate some
of the most fraught episodes of my life.
Also from those undergraduate Merton days, I will always be grateful to my two physics
tutors, Dr. Michael Baker (1930–2017) and Dr. Michael G. Bowler, who not only taught me a great
deal of physics themselves, but who also went out of their way to arrange for me to have more
advanced, individual tuition on General Relativity and on spinors, from two remarkable Fellows
of Merton, Dr. Brian D. Bramson and Dr. Richard S. Ward. In particular, Dr. Bramson’s enthusiasm
for science was utterly contagious, and it was he who gave me my very ﬁrst exposure to the
(revelatory!) work of Penrose, and who pushed me to apply to undertake a DPhil in Penrose’s
“Relativity Group.”
Moving forward to my graduate student days studying under Penrose, I wish to thank, once
again, my friend George Burnett-Stuart, a fellow advisee of Penrose. George and I shared a small
house together on Great Clarendon St. for several years as we carried out our doctoral work, and
in the course of our endless discussions of music, physics, and mathematics, George helped me
to reﬁne both my conception of the nature of mathematics, and of what constitutes an acceptable
explanation within that subject. For better or for worse, George bears great responsibility for the
mathematician that I am today.
Moving forward again, to my life at USF, I am grateful to John Stillwell—who just retired—
and his wonderful wife, Elaine, for 20 happy and productive years as colleagues and friends.
While I have picked his brains many times during the course of writing this book, my greatest
debt is to his many writings. Indeed, our relationship began with a “fan letter” I wrote to him
in reaction to the ﬁrst edition of his magniﬁcent magnum opus, Mathematics and Its History. A
few years later, while serving as Associate Dean for Sciences, I was able to lure John away from
Australia, creating a professorship for him at USF. Both VCA and VDGF owe a great deal to John’s
holistic grasp of the entire expanse of mathematics, and his ability to use this perspective to give
back meaning to mathematical ideas, all of which he has so generously shared with the world
through his many wonderful books.
In 1996, I concluded the Acknowledgements of VCA with these words: “Lastly, I thank my
dearest wife Mary. During the writing of this book she allowed me to pretend that science was
the most important thing in life; now that the book is over, she is my daily proof that there is
something even more important.” Today, more than two decades later, my love for Mary has only
grown more profound, but I now have two more daily proofs than I had before!

In 1999, Mary and I were blessed with twins: Faith and Hope have been our dazzling beacons
of pride and joy ever since. I’m sorry that VDGF has hung like a dark cloud over the life of my
family for almost half of my daughters’s lives, and that it has robbed us of so much time together.
Yet it is the love of these three souls that has given my life meaning and purpose, and has sustained
me throughout the long struggle that created this work.

The Nature of Space


Chapter 1
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
1.1
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Geometry
Differential Geometry is the application of calculus to the geometry of space that is curved. But to
understand space that is curved we shall ﬁrst try to understand space that is ﬂat.
We inhabit a natural world pervaded by curved objects, and if a child asks us the meaning of
the word “ﬂat,” we are most likely to answer in terms of the absence of curvature: a smooth surface
without any bumps or hollows. Nevertheless, the very earliest mathematicians seem to have been
drawn to the singular simplicity and uniformity of the ﬂat plane, and they were rewarded with
the discovery of startlingly beautiful facts about geometric ﬁgures constructed within it. With the
beneﬁt of enormous hindsight, some of these facts can be seen to characterize the plane’s ﬂatness.
[1.1]
Pythagoras’s
Theorem:
the
geometry
of
32 + 42 = 52.
One of the earliest and most profound
such facts to be discovered was Pythagoras’s
Theorem. Surely the ancients must have been
awed, as any sensitive person must remain
today, that a seemingly unalloyed fact about
numbers,
32 + 42 = 52,
in fact has geometrical meaning, as seen in
[1.1].1
While Pythagoras himself lived in Greece
around 500
BCE, the theorem bearing his
name was discovered much earlier, in various
places around the world. The earliest known
example of such knowledge is recorded in the
Babylonian clay tablet (catalogued as “Plimp-
ton 322”) shown in [1.2], which was un-
earthed in what is now Iraq, and which dates
from about 1800 BCE.
The tablet lists Pythagorean triples:2 integers (a, b, h) such that h is the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with sides a and b, and therefore a2 + b2 = h2. Some of these ancient examples are
impressively large, and it seems clear that they did not stumble upon them, but rather possessed
a mathematical process for generating solutions. For example, the fourth row of the tablet records
the fact that 135002 + 127092 = 185412.
The deeper knowledge that underlay these ancient results is not known,3 but to ﬁnd the ﬁrst
evidence of the “modern,” logical, deductive approach to mathematics we must jump 1200 years
into the future of the clay tablet. Scholars believe that it was Thales of Miletus (around 600 BCE)
1We repeat what was said in the Prologue: equations are labelled with parentheses (round brackets)—(. . .), while ﬁgures are
labelled with square brackets—[. . .].
2In fact the tablet only records two members (a, h) of the triples (a, b, h).
3In the seventeenth century, Fermat and Newton reconstructed and generalized a geometrical method of generating the general
solution, due to Diophantus. See Exercise 5.

who ﬁrst pioneered the idea of deducing new
results from previously established ones, the
logical chain beginning at a handful of clearly
articulated assumptions, or axioms.
Leaping forward again, 300 years beyond
Thales, we ﬁnd one of the most perfect exem-
plars of this new approach in Euclid’s Ele-
ments, dating from 300 BCE. This work sought
to bring order, clarity, and rigour to geometry
by deducing everything from just ﬁve simple
axioms, the ﬁfth and last of which dealt with
parallel lines.
Deﬁning two lines to be parallel if they
do not meet, Euclid’s Fifth Axiom4 is illus-
trated in [1.3]:
Parallel Axiom. Through any point p not on the line L there exists precisely one
line P that is parallel to L.
But the character of this axiom was more complex and less immediate than that of the ﬁrst
four, and mathematicians began a long struggle to dispense with it as an assumption, instead
seeking to show that it must be a logical consequence of the ﬁrst four axioms.
This tension went unresolved for the next 2000 years. As the centuries passed, many attempts
were made to prove the Parallel Axiom, and the number and intensity of these efforts reached a
crescendo in the 1700s, but all met with failure.
Yet along the way useful equivalents of the axiom emerged. For example: There exist similar
triangles of different sizes (Wallis in 1663; see Stillwell (2010)). But the very ﬁrst equivalent was
already present in Euclid, and it is the one still taught to every school child: the angles in a triangle
add up to two right angles. See [1.3].
The explanation of these failures only emerged around 1830. Completing a journey that had
begun 4000 years earlier, Nikolai Lobachevsky and János Bolyai independently announced the

discovery of an entirely new form of geometry (now called Hyperbolic Geometry) taking place in
a new kind of plane (now called the hyperbolic plane). In this Geometry the ﬁrst four Euclidean
axioms hold, but the parallel axiom does not. Instead, the following is true:
Hyperbolic Axiom. There are at least two parallel lines through p that do not
meet L.
(1.1)
[1.4] Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777).
These pioneers explored the logical consequences
of this axiom, and by purely abstract reasoning
were led to a host of fascinating results within
a rich new geometry that was bizarrely different
from that of Euclid.
Many others before them, perhaps most
notably Saccheri (in 1733; see Stillwell 2010) and
Lambert (in 1766; see Stillwell 2010), had discov-
ered some of these consequences of (1.1), but their
aim in exploring these consequences had been to
ﬁnd a contradiction, which they believed would
ﬁnally prove that Euclidean Geometry to be the
One True Geometry.
Certainly Saccheri believed he had found a
clear contradiction when he published “Euclid
Freed of Every Flaw.” But Lambert is a much more
perplexing case, and he is perhaps an unsung hero
in this story. His results penetrated so deeply into
this new geometry that it seems impossible that
he did not at times believe in the reality of what
he was doing. Regardless of his motivation and
beliefs5, Lambert (shown in [1.4]) was certainly the ﬁrst to discover a remarkable fact6 about the
angle sum of a triangle under axiom (1.1), and his result will be central to much that follows in
Act II.
Nevertheless, Lobachevsky and Bolyai richly deserve their fame for having been the ﬁrst to
recognize and fully embrace the idea that they had discovered an entirely new, consistent, non-
Euclidean Geometry. But what this new geometry really meant, and what it might be useful for,
even they could not say.7
Remarkably and surprisingly, it was the Differential Geometry of curved surfaces that ultimately
resolved these questions. As we shall explain, in 1868 the Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami
ﬁnally succeeded in giving Hyperbolic Geometry a concrete interpretation, setting it upon a
ﬁrm and intuitive foundation from which it has since grown and ﬂourished. Sadly, neither
Lobachevsky nor Bolyai lived to see this: they died in 1856 and 1860, respectively.
This non-Euclidean Geometry had in fact already manifested itself in various branches of
mathematics throughout history, but always in disguise. Henri Poincaré (beginning around 1882)
was the ﬁrst not only to strip it of its camouﬂage, but also to recognize and exploit its power
5I thank Roger Penrose for making me see that Lambert deserves greater credit than he is usually granted. Penrose did so by
means of the following analogy: “Should we not give credit to Einstein for the cosmological constant, even if he introduced it
for the wrong reasons? And should we blame him for later retracting it, calling it the “greatest blunder of my life”? Or what
about General Relativity itself, which Einstein seemed to become less and less convinced was the right theory (needing to be
replaced by some kind of non-singular uniﬁed ﬁeld theory) as time went on?” [Private communication.]
6If you cannot wait, it’s (1.8).
7Lobachevsky did in fact put this geometry to use to evaluate previously unknown integrals, but (at least in hindsight) this
particular application must be viewed as relatively minor.

in such diverse areas as Complex Analysis, Differential Equations, Number Theory, and Topo-
logy. Its continued vitality and centrality in the mathematics of the 20th and twenty-ﬁrst cen-
turies is demonstrated by Thurston’s work on 3-manifolds, Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last
Theorem, and Perelman’s proof of the Poincaré Conjecture (as a special case of Thurston’s
Geometrization Conjecture), to name but three examples.
In Act II we shall describe Beltrami’s breakthrough, as well as the nature of Hyperbolic Geo-
metry, but for now we wish to explore a different, simpler kind of non-Euclidean Geometry, one
that was already known to the Ancients.
1.2
Spherical Geometry
To construct a non-Euclidean Geometry we must deny the existence of a unique parallel. The
Hyperbolic Axiom assumes two or more parallels, but there is one other logical possibility—no
parallels:
Spherical Axiom. There are no lines through p that are parallel to L : every line
meets L.
(1.2)
Thus there are actually two non-Euclidean8 geometries: spherical and hyperbolic.
As the name suggests, Spherical Geometry can be realized on the surface of a sphere—
denoted S2 in the case of the unit sphere—which we may picture as the surface of the Earth. On
this sphere, what should be the analogue of a “straight line” connecting two points on the surface?
Answer: the shortest route between them! But if you wish to sail or ﬂy from London to New York,
for example, what is the shortest route?
L
p
[1.5] The great circles of S2 intersect in pairs of
antipodal points.
The answer, already known to the ancient
mariners, is that the shortest route is an arc of
a great circle, such as the equator, obtained
by cutting the sphere with a plane passing
through its centre. In [1.5] we have chosen L to
be the equator, and it is clear that (1.2) is satis-
ﬁed: every line through p meets L in a pair of
antipodal (i.e., diametrically opposite) points.
In the plane, the shortest route is also the
straightest route, and in fact the same is true on
the sphere: in a precise sense to be discussed
later, the great circle trajectory bends neither
to the right nor to the left as it traverses the
spherical surface.
There are other ways of constructing the
great circles on the Earth that do not require
thinking about planes passing through the
completely inaccessible centre of the Earth.
For example, on a globe you may map out
your great circle journey by holding down one end of a piece of string on London and pulling
the string tightly over the surface so that the other end is on New York. The taut string has

“Hyperbolic Geometry.”

automatically found the shortest, straightest route—the shorter9 of the two arcs into which the
great circle through the two cities is divided by those cities.
With the analogue of straight lines now found, we can “do geometry” within this sphe-
rical surface. For example, given three points on the surface of the Earth, we can connect them
together with arcs of great circles to obtain a “triangle.” Figure [1.6] illustrates this in the case
where one vertex is located at the north pole, and the other two are on the equator.
A
[1.6] A particularly simple “triangle”
on the sphere.
But if this non-Euclidean Spherical Geometry was
already used by ancient mariners to navigate the oceans,
and by astronomers to map the spherical night sky, what
then was so shocking and new about the non-Euclidean
geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai?
The answer is that this Spherical Geometry was
merely considered to be inherited from the Euclidean Geo-
metry of the 3-dimensional space in which the sphere
resides. No thought was given in those times to the
sphere’s internal 2-dimensional geometry as representing
an alternative to Euclid’s plane. Not only did it violate
Euclid’s ﬁfth axiom, it also violated a much more basic
one (Euclid’s ﬁrst axiom) that we can always draw a
unique straight line connecting two points, for this fails
when the points are antipodal.
On the other hand, the Hyperbolic Geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai was a much more
serious affront to Euclidean Geometry, containing familiar lines of inﬁnite length, yet ﬂaunting
multiple parallels, ludicrous angle sums, and many other seemingly nonsensical results. Yet the
21-year-old Bolyai was conﬁdent and exuberant in his discoveries, writing to his father, “From
nothing I have created another entirely new world.”
We end with a tale of tragedy. Bolyai’s father was a friend of Gauss, and sent him what
János had achieved. By this time Gauss had himself made some important discoveries in this
area, but had kept them secret. In any case, János had seen further than Gauss. A kind word in
public from Gauss, the most famous mathematician in the world, would have assured the young
mathematician a bright future. But Nature and nurture sometimes conspire to pour extraordinary
mathematical gifts into a vessel marred by very ordinary human ﬂaws, and Gauss’s reaction to
Bolyai’s marvellous discoveries was mean-spirited and self-serving in the extreme.
First, Gauss kept Bolyai in suspense for six months, then he replied as follows:
Now something about the work of your son. You will probably be shocked for a moment
when I begin by saying that I cannot praise it, but I cannot do anything else, since to praise
it would be to praise myself. The whole content of the paper, the path that your son has
taken, and the results to which he has been led, agree almost everywhere with my own
meditations, which have occupied me in part for 30–35 years.
Gauss did however “thank” Bolyai’s son for having “saved him the trouble”10 of having to write
down theorems he had known for decades.
János Bolyai never recovered from the surgical blow delivered by Gauss, and he abandoned
mathematics for the rest of his life.11
9If the two points are antipodal, such as the north and south poles, then the two arcs are the same length. Furthermore, the
great circle itself is no longer unique: every meridian is a great circle connecting the poles.
10Gauss had previously denigrated Abel’s discovery of elliptic functions in precisely the same manner; see Stillwell (2010,
p. 236).
11If this depresses you, turn your thoughts to the uplifting counterweight of Leonhard Euler. An intellectual volcano erupting
with wildly original thoughts (some of which we shall meet later) he was also a kind and generous spirit. We cite one, parallel

1.3
The Angular Excess of a Spherical Triangle
As we have said, the parallel axiom is equivalent to the fact that the angles in a triangle sum to π. It
follows that both the spherical axiom and the hyperbolic axiom must lead to geometries in which
the angles do not sum to π. To quantify this departure from Euclidean Geometry, we introduce the
angular excess, deﬁned to be the amount E by which the angle sum exceeds π:
E ≡(angle sum of triangle) −π.
For example, for the triangle shown in [1.6], E = (θ + π
2 + π
2 ) −π = θ.
A crucial insight now arises if we compare the triangle’s angular excess with its area A. Let the
radius of the sphere be R. Since the triangle occupies a fraction (θ/2π) of the northern hemisphere,
A = (θ/2π) 2πR2 = θ R2. Thus,
E = 1
R2 A.
(1.3)
[1.7] Thomas Harriot (1560–1621).
In 1603 the English mathematician Thomas
Harriot (see [1.7]) made the remarkable discov-
ery12 that this relationship holds for any triangle
∆on the sphere; see [1.8a]. Harriot’s elementary
but ingenious argument13 goes as follows.
Prolonging the great-circle sides of ∆divides
the surface of the sphere into eight triangles, the
four triangles labelled ∆, ∆α, ∆β, ∆γ each being
paired with a congruent antipodal triangle. This
is clearer in [1.8b]. Since the area of the sphere is
4πR2, we deduce that
A(∆) + A(∆α) + A(∆β) + A(∆γ) = 2πR2.
(1.4)
On the other hand, it is clear in [1.8b] that ∆
and ∆α together form a wedge whose area is a
fraction (α/2π) of the area of the sphere:
A(∆) + A(∆α)
=
2αR2.
Similarly,

example. When the then-unknown 19-year-old Lagrange wrote to him with overlapping discoveries in the calculus of varia-
tions, Euler wrote back: “. . . I deduced this myself. However, I decided to conceal this until you publish your results, since in
no way do I want to take away from you any of the glory that you deserve.” See Gindikin (2007, p. 216). Incidentally, Euler
also personally intervened to rescue Lambert’s career!
12This discovery is most often attributed to Girard, who rediscovered it about 25 years later.
13This argument was later rediscovered by Euler in 1781.

(1.5)
Finally, subtracting (1.4) from (1.5), we ﬁnd that
A(∆) = R2(α + β + γ −π) = R2 E(∆),
thereby proving (1.3).
1.4
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Geometry of Curved Surfaces
The mathematics associated with this stretched-string construction of a “straight line” will be
explored in depth later in the book. For now we merely observe that the construction can be
applied equally well to a nonspherical surface, such as the crookneck squash shown in [1.9].
Just as on the sphere, we stretch a string over the surface, thereby ﬁnding the shortest,
straightest route between two points, such as a and b. Provided that the string can slide around
on the surface easily, the tension in the string ensures that the resulting path is as short as
possible. Note that in the case of cd, we must imagine that the string runs over the inside of the
surface.
In order to deal with all possible pairs of points in a uniform way, it is therefore best to imagine
the surface as made up of two thinly separated layers, with the string trapped between them.
On the other hand, this is only useful for thought experiments, not actual experiments. We shall
overcome this obstacle shortly by providing a practical method of constructing these straightest
curves on the surface of a physical object, even if the patch of surface bends the wrong way for a
string to be stretched tightly over the outside of the object.
These shortest paths on a curved surface are the equivalent of straight lines in the plane, and
they will play a crucial role throughout this book—they are called geodesics. Thus, to use this new
word, we may say that geodesics in the plane are straight lines, and geodesics on the sphere are
great circles.
But even on the sphere the length-minimizing deﬁnition of “geodesic” is provisional, because
we see that nonantipodal points are connected by two arcs of the great circle passing through them:
the short one (which is the shortest route) and the long one. Yet the long arc is every bit as much a
geodesic as the short one. There is the additional complication on the sphere that antipodal points

are connected by multiple geodesics, and this nonuniqueness occurs on more general surfaces, too.
What is true is that any two points that are sufﬁciently close together can be joined by a unique
geodesic segment that is the shortest route between them.
Just as a line segment in the plane can be extended indeﬁnitely in either direction by laying
down overlapping segments, so too can a geodesic segment be extended on a curved surface, and
this extension is unique. For example, in [1.9] we have extended the dashed geodesic segment
connecting the black dots, by laying down the overlapping dotted segment between the white
points.
Because of the subtleties associated with the length-minimizing characterization of geodesics,
before long we will provide an alternative, purely local characterization of geodesics, based on
their straightness.
With these caveats in place, it is now clear how we should deﬁne distance within a surface
such as [1.9]: the distance between two sufﬁciently close points a and b is the length of the geodesic
segment connecting them.
Figure [1.9] shows how we may then deﬁne, for example, a “circle of radius r and centre c”
as the locus of points at distance r from c. To construct this geodesic circle we may take a piece of
string of length r, hold one end ﬁxed at c, then (keeping the string taut) drag the other end round
on the surface. But just as the angles in a triangle no longer sum to π, so now the circumference
of a circle no longer is equal to 2πr. In fact you should be able to convince yourself that for the
illustrated circle the circumference is less than 2πr.
Given three points on the surface, we may join them with geodesics to form a geodesic
triangle; [1.9] shows two such triangles, ∆1 and ∆2:
•
Looking at the angles in ∆1, it seems clear that they sum to more than π, so E(∆1) > 0, like a
triangle in Spherical Geometry.

1.5 Constructing Geodesics via Their Straightness
•
11
[1.10] Bending a piece of paper changes the extrinsic geometry, but not the intrinsic geometry.
•
On the other hand, it is equally clear that the angles of ∆2 sum to less than π: E(∆2) < 0, and
(as we shall explain) this opposite behaviour is in fact exhibited by triangles in Hyperbolic
Geometry. Note also that if we construct a circle in this saddle-shaped part of the surface, the
circumference is now greater than 2πr.
The concept of a geodesic belongs to the so-called intrinsic geometry of the surface—a fun-
damentally new view of geometry, introduced by Gauss (1827). It means the geometry that is
knowable to tiny, ant-like, intelligent (but 2-dimensional!) creatures living within the surface. As
we have discussed, these creatures can, for example, deﬁne a geodesic “straight line” connecting
two nearby points as the shortest route within their world (the surface) connecting the two points.
From there they can go on to deﬁne triangles, and so on. Deﬁned in this way, it is clear that the
intrinsic geometry is unaltered when the surface is bent (as a piece of paper can be) into quite
different shapes in space, as long as distances within the surface are not stretched or distorted in
any way. To the ant-like creatures within the surface, such changes are utterly undetectable.
Under such a bending, the so-called extrinsic geometry (how the surface sits in space) most
certainly does change. See [1.10]. On the left is a ﬂat piece of paper on which we have drawn a
triangle ∆with angles (π/2), (π/6), and (π/3). Of course E(∆) = 0. Clearly we can bend such a
ﬂat piece of paper into either of the two (extrinsically) curved surfaces on the right.14 However,
intrinsically these surfaces have undergone no change at all—they are both as ﬂat as a pancake!
The illustrated triangles on these surfaces (into which ∆is carried by our stretch-free bending of
the paper) are identical to the ones that intelligent ants would construct using geodesics, and in
both cases E = 0: geometry on these surfaces is Euclidean.
Even if we take a patch of a surface that is intrinsically curved, so that a triangle within it has
E ̸= 0, it too can generally be bent somewhat without stretching or tearing it, thereby altering its
extrinsic geometry while leaving its intrinsic geometry unaltered. For example, cut a ping pong
ball in half and gently squeeze the rim of one of the hemispheres, distorting that circular rim into
an oval (but not an oval lying in a single plane).
1.5
Constructing Geodesics via Their Straightness
We have already alluded to the fact that geodesics on a surface have at least two characteristics in
common with lines in the plane: (1) they provide the shortest route between two points that are
not too far apart and (2) they provide the “straightest” route between these points. In this section
we seek to clarify what we mean by “straightness,” leading to a very simple and practical method
of constructing geodesics on a physical surface.

[1.11] On the curved surface of a fruit or vegetable, peel a narrow strip surrounding a geodesic, then lay it ﬂat on
the table. You will obtain a straight line in the plane!
Most texts on Differential Geometry pay scant attention to such practical matters, and it is
perhaps for this reason that the construction we shall describe is surprisingly little known in
the literature.15 In sharp contrast, in this book we urge you to explore the ideas by all means
possible: theoretical contemplation, drawing, computer experiments, and (especially!) physical
experiments with actual surfaces. Your local fruit and vegetable shop can supply your laboratory
with many interesting shapes, such as the yellow summer squash shown in [1.11].
We can now use this vegetable to reveal the hidden straightness of geodesics via an experi-
ment that we hope you will repeat for yourself:
1. On a fruit or vegetable, construct a geodesic by stretching a string over its curved surface.
2. Use a pen to trace the path of the string, then remove the string.
3. Make shallow incisions on either side of (and close to) the inked path, then use a vegetable
peeler or small knife to remove the narrow strip of peel between the two cuts.
4. Lay the strip of peel ﬂat on the table, and witness the marvellous fact that the geodesic within
the peeled strip has become a straight line in the plane!
But why?!
To understand this, ﬁrst let us be clear that although the strip is free to bend in the direction
perpendicular to the surface (i.e., perpendicular to itself), it is rigid if we try to bend it sideways,
tangent to the surface. Now let us employ proof by contradiction, and imagine what would hap-
pen if such a peeled geodesic did not yield a straight line when laid ﬂat on the table. It is both a
15One of the rare exceptions is Henderson (1998), which we strongly recommend to you; for more details, see the Further
Reading section at the end of this book.

1.5 Constructing Geodesics via Their Straightness
•
13
[1.12] Suppose that the illustrated dotted path is a geodesic such that a narrow (white) strip surrounding it does
not become a straight line when laid ﬂat in the plane. But in that case we can shrink the dotted path in the plane
(towards the shortest, straight-line route in the plane) thereby producing the solid path. But if we then reattach
the strip to the surface, this solid path is still shorter than the original dotted path, which was supposed to be the
shortest path within the surface—a contradiction!
drawback and an advantage of conducting such physical experiments that they will simply not
permit us to construct something that is impossible, as is required in our desired mathematical
proof by contradiction. Nevertheless, let us suppose that there exists a geodesic path, such as the
dotted one shown on top left of [1.12], that when peeled and laid ﬂat on the table (on the right)
does not become a straight line.
The shortest route between the ends of this dotted (nonstraight) plane curve is the straight
line connecting them. (As illustrated, this is the path of the true geodesic we already found using
the string—but pretend you don’t know that for now!) Thus we may shorten the dotted curve by
deforming it slightly towards this straight, shortest route, yielding the solid path along the edge
of the peeled strip. Therefore, after reattaching the strip to the surface (bottom left) the solid curve
provides a shorter route over the surface than the dotted one, which we had supposed to be the
shortest: a contradiction! Thus we have proved our previous assertion:
If a narrow strip surrounding a segment G of a geodesic is cut out of a surface and
laid ﬂat in the plane, then G becomes a segment of a straight line.
(1.6)
We are now very close to the promised simple and practical construction of geodesics. Look
again at step 3 of [1.11], where we peeled off the strip of surface. But imagine now that we are
reattaching the strip to the surface, instead. Ignore the history of how we got to this point: what are
we actually doing right now in this reattachment process? We have picked up a narrow straight
strip (of three-dimensional peel—but mathematically idealized as a two-dimensional strip) and
we have unrolled it back onto the surface into the shallow channel from which we cut it. But here

14
•
Chapter 1 Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
is the crucial observation: this shallow channel need not exist—the surface decides where the strip
must go as we unroll it!
Thus, as a kind of time-reversed converse of (1.6), we obtain a remarkably simple and prac-
tical method16 of constructing geodesics on a physical surface:
To construct a geodesic on a surface, emanating from a point p in direction v, stick
one end of a length of narrow sticky tape down at p and unroll it onto the surface,
starting in the direction v.
(1.7)
(Note, however, that this does not provide a construction of the geodesic connecting p to a
speciﬁed target point q.)
If this construction seems too simple to be true, please try it on any curved surface you have
to hand. You can check that the sticky tape17 is indeed tracing out a geodesic by stretching a string
over the surface between two points on the tape: the string will follow the same path as the tape.
But note that, as a promised bonus, this new tape construction works on any part of a surface, even
where the surface is concave towards you, so that the stretched-string construction breaks down.
Of course all of this is a concrete manifestation of a mathematical idealization. A totally ﬂat
narrow strip of tape of nonzero width cannot18 be made to ﬁt perfectly on a genuinely curved
surface, but its centre line can be made to rest on the surface, while the rest of the tape is tangent
to the surface.
1.6
The Nature of Space
Let us return to the history of the discovery of non-Euclidean Geometry, and take our ﬁrst look at
how these two new geometries differ from Euclid’s.
As we have said, Euclidean Geometry, is characterized by the vanishing of E(∆). Note that,
unlike the original formulation of the parallel axiom, this statement can be checked against experiment:
construct a triangle, measure its angles, and see if they add up to π. Gauss may have been the ﬁrst
person to ever conceive of the possibility that physical space might not be Euclidean, and he even
attempted the above experiment, using three mountain tops as the vertices of his triangle, and
using light rays for its edges.
Within the accuracy permitted by his equipment, he found E = 0. Quite correctly, Gauss did
not conclude that physical space is deﬁnitely Euclidean in structure, but rather that if it is not
Euclidean then its deviation from Euclidean Geometry is extremely small. But he did go so far as
to say (see Rosenfeld 1988, p. 215) that he wished that this non-Euclidean Geometry might apply
to the real world. In Act IV we shall see that this was a prophetic statement.
16This important fact is surprisingly hard to ﬁnd in the literature. After we (re)discovered it, more than 30 years ago, we began
searching, and the earliest mention of the underlying idea we could ﬁnd at that time was in Aleksandrov (1969, p. 99), albeit
in a less practical form: he imagined pressing a ﬂexible metal ruler down onto the surface. Later, the basic idea also appeared
in Koenderink (1990), Casey (1996), and Henderson (1998). However, we have since learned that the essential idea (though not
in our current, practical form) goes all the way back to Levi-Civita, more than a century ago! See the footnote on page 236.
17We recommend using masking tape (aka painter’s tape) because it comes in bright colours, and once a strip has been created,
it can be detached and reattached repeatedly, with ease. A simple way to create narrow strips (from the usually wide roll of
tape) is to stick a length of tape down onto a kitchen cutting board, then use a sharp knife to cut down its length, creating
strips as narrow as you please.
18This is a consequence of a fundamental theorem we shall meet later, called the Theorema Egregium.

1.6 The Nature of Space
•
15
Although Gauss had bragged to friends that he had anticipated the Hyperbolic Geometry
of Lobachevsky and Bolyai by decades, even he had unknowingly been scooped on some of its
central results.
In 1766 (eleven years before Gauss was born) Lambert rediscovered Harriot’s result on the
sphere and then broke totally new ground in pursuing the analogous consequences of the Hyper-
bolic Axiom (1.1). First, he found that a triangle in Hyperbolic Geometry (if such a thing even
existed) would behave oppositely to one in Spherical Geometry:
•
In Spherical Geometry the angle sum of a triangle is greater than π: E > 0.
•
In Hyperbolic Geometry the angle sum of a triangle is less than π: E < 0.
Thus a hyperbolic triangle behaves like a triangle drawn on a saddle-shaped piece of surface, like
∆2 in [1.9]. Later we shall see that this is no accident.
Furthermore, Lambert discovered the crucial fact that E(∆) is again simply proportional
to A(∆):
In both Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry,
E(∆) = K A(∆),
where K is a constant that is positive in Spherical Geometry, and negative in
Hyperbolic Geometry.
(1.8)
Several interesting observations can be made in connection with this result:
•
Although there are no qualitative differences between them, there are nevertheless inﬁnitely
many different Spherical Geometries, depending on the value of the positive constant K.
Likewise, each negative value of K yields a different Hyperbolic Geometry.
•
Since the angle sum of a triangle cannot be negative, E ⩾−π. Thus in Hyperbolic Geometry
(K < 0) we have the strange and surprising result that no triangle can have an area greater than
|π/K|.
•
From (1.8) we deduce that two triangles of different size cannot have the same angles. In other
words, in non-Euclidean Geometry, similar triangles do not exist! (This accords with Wallis’s
1663 discovery that the existence of similar triangles is equivalent to the Parallel Axiom.)
•
Closely related to the previous point is the fact that in non-Euclidean Geometry there exists
an absolute unit of length. (Gauss himself found it to be an exciting possibility that this purely
mathematical fact might be realized in the physical world.) For example, in Spherical Geo-
metry we could deﬁne this absolute unit of length to be the side of the equilateral triangle
having, for instance, angle sum 1.01π. Similarly, in Hyperbolic Geometry we could deﬁne it
to be the side of the equilateral triangle having angle sum 0.99π.
•
A somewhat more natural way of deﬁning the absolute unit of length is in terms of the con-
stant K. Since the radian measure of angle is deﬁned as a ratio of lengths, E is a pure number.
On the other hand, the area A has units of (length)2. It follows that K must have units of
1/(length)2, and so there exists a length R such that K can be written as follows: K = +(1/R2)
in Spherical Geometry; K = −(1/R2) in Hyperbolic Geometry. Of course in Spherical Geo-
metry we already know that the length R occurring in the formula K = +(1/R2) is simply the

16
•
Chapter 1 Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
radius of the sphere. Later we will see that this length R occurring in the formula K = −(1/R2)
can be given an equally intuitive and concrete interpretation in Hyperbolic Geometry.
•
The smaller the triangle, the harder it is to distinguish it from a Euclidean triangle: only when
the linear dimensions are a signiﬁcant fraction of R will the differences become discernable.
For example, we humans are small compared to the radius of the Earth, so if we ﬁnd ourselves
in a boat in the middle of a lake, its surface appears to be a Euclidean plane, whereas in reality
it is part of a sphere. This Euclidean illusion for small ﬁgures is the reason that Gauss chose the
largest possible triangle to conduct his light-ray experiment, thereby increasing his chances
of detecting any small curvature that might be present in the space through which the light
rays travelled.

Chapter 2
Gaussian Curvature
2.1
Introduction
[2.1] Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855).
The proportionality constant,
K = + 1
R2 ,
that enters into Spherical Geometry via
Harriot’s result (1.3), is called the Gaussian
curvature1 of the sphere. The smaller the
radius R, the more tightly curved is the sur-
face of the sphere, and the greater the value
of the Gaussian curvature K.
Likewise, in Hyperbolic Geometry the
negative constant
K = −1
R2
occurring in (1.8) is again called the Gaus-
sian curvature, for reasons we shall explain
shortly.
This intrinsic2 concept K was anno-
unced by Gauss (after a decade of private
investigation) in his revolutionary “Gen-
eral Investigations of Curved Surfaces,”3
published in 1827.
As we now explain, Gauss introduced
this concept to measure the curvature at
each point of a general, irregular surface such as that depicted in [1.9]. This one idea of curvature
will dominate all that is to come. According to Harriot’s and Lambert’s results (1.8),
K = E(∆)
A(∆) = angular excess per unit area.
In both Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry this interpretation holds for a triangle ∆of any size
and any location. But on a more general surface such as in [1.9] this deﬁnition makes no sense, for
even the sign of E varies between triangles, such as ∆1 and ∆2, that reside in different parts of the
surface.
1Also called the Gauss curvature, intrinsic curvature, total curvature, or just plain curvature.
2As we shall discuss later, Olinde Rodrigues had arrived at and published the same concept as early as 1815, but from an
extrinsic point of view. Gauss was not aware that he had been anticipated in this way.

Chapter 2 Gaussian Curvature
[2.2] The Gaussian curvature K(p) at a point is the angular excess per unit area as a geodesic triangle shrinks to
that point. In this example, K(p) > 0 and K(q) < 0.
To deﬁne the Gaussian curvature at a point p on such a surface we now imagine a small
geodesic triangle ∆p containing p, and then allow the triangle to shrink down towards p.
Using the construction of geodesics discovered in the previous section, [2.2] depicts such
a sequence of shrinking triangles, converging towards a point on the surface of an inﬂatable
swimming pool ring, the mathematical name for which is a torus. We now deﬁne the Gaussian
curvature K(p) at p to be the limit as this triangle shrinks down towards p:
K(p) = lim
∆p→p
E(∆p)
A(∆p) = angular excess per unit area at p.
(2.1)
At this stage it is not meant to be obvious to you that this limit exists, independently of the
shape of the triangle and the precise manner in which it shrinks; this will be proved later. As
our drama unfolds we shall discover several other ways4 of interpreting the Gaussian curvature
and of calculating its value in concrete cases.
4For a mathematical concept to be truly fundamental it must lie at the intersection of different branches of mathematics. Thus
it is to be expected that each of these branches will provide a seemingly distinct yet equally natural way of looking at one and
the same concept.

2.2 The Circumference and Area of a Circle
•
19
[2.3] The Gaussian curvature K is the local angular excess per unit area: its sign is negative if the surface looks
like a saddle, positive if it’s like a hill, and it vanishes if it’s like a curled piece of paper.
The deﬁnition in (2.1) extends beyond triangles. If we replace ∆p with a small n-gon then
(see Ex. 10),
E(n-gon) ≡[angle sum] −(n −2)π,
(2.2)
and the interpretation of curvature in (2.1) as angular excess per unit area applies without change.
Inspection of the inﬂatable pool ring in [2.2] should make it clear that K(p) > 0 at every point
p on the outer half, where the immediate neighbourhood of p resembles a hill, whereas K(q) < 0
at every point q on the inner half, where the immediate neighbourhood of q resembles a saddle.
Figure [2.3] summarizes this.

[2.4] A circle of radius r on a sphere of
radius R has circumference C(r), given
by C(r) = 2πR sin(r/R).
But why is K(p) so important? Yes, clearly it controls
small triangles to some extent, but there is so much
more to geometry than just triangles! The answer is
that while we may have chosen to deﬁne K(p) (for the
moment) in terms of small triangles, we will gradually
discover that the curvature has an iron grip over every
aspect of geometry within the surface. Let us give just
two examples for now.
In [1.9] we indicated how a “circle of radius r” cen-
tred at c could be deﬁned by taking the end p of a
geodesic segment cp of ﬁxed length r and swinging it
fully around c. Let us calculate the circumference C(r)
of such a circle constructed on the sphere of radius R.
Referring to [2.4], we see that
ρ = R sin ϕ
and
ϕ = r
R
=⇒
C(r) = 2πR sin(r/R).
(2.3)
Just as the curvature governs the departure of the angle sum of a triangle from the Euclidean
prediction of π, so too does it govern the departure of C(r) from the Euclidean prediction of 2πr.
To see this, recall the power series for sine:

20
•
Chapter 2 Gaussian Curvature
sin ϕ = ϕ −1
3!ϕ3 + 1
5!ϕ5 + · · · .
Thus, as ϕ vanishes,
ϕ −sin ϕ ≍1
6ϕ3.
(We remind the reader that here, ≍denotes Newton’s concept of ultimate equality, as introduced
in the Prologue.) It follows from (2.3) that as r shrinks to zero,
2πr −C(r) = 2πR[(r/R) −sin(r/R)] ≍πr3
3R2 .
In other words, the inhabitants of S2 can now determine the curvature of their world by examining
the circumference of a small circle, just as easily as they previously could by examining the angles
of a small triangle:
K ≍3
π
[2πr −C(r)
r3
]
.
(2.4)
Remarkably, as we will be able to show much later, in Act IV, this formula continues to correctly
measure the Gaussian curvature on a general surface! (Note that the power of r in the denominator
could have been anticipated: we know that K has dimensions of 1/(length)2, and circumference
is a length, so we require (length)3 in the denominator.)
Continuing with this example, let us instead examine the area A(r) of the polar cap bounded
by this circle. Again it is the curvature that governs how the area departs from the Euclidean
prediction of πr2. With the assistance of the formula for the polar cap (see Ex. 10, p. 85) it is not
hard to verify [exercise] that, in fact,
K ≍12
π
[πr2 −A(r)
r4
]
.
(2.5)
And again this formula turns out to be universal! (Again, the same reasoning as above explains
the fourth power in the denominator.)
While we are not yet in a position to prove the universality of (2.4) and (2.5), we can at least
see that they do indeed yield the correct sign at each point of a variably curved surface, such as that
shown in [1.9]. For if the immediate vicinity of a point on such a surface is positively curved, then
it is hill-shaped near that point (as it everywhere in the region of [1.9] containing ∆1). Thus both
the circumference and area of a small circle centred there will indeed be squeezed by the curvature
and be less than they would have been in a ﬂat Euclidean plane. Thus, both the preceding formulas
yield K > 0, as they should.
On the other hand, if the surface is saddle-shaped near the point, the opposite happens. Recall
that we pointed out in [1.9] that a circle drawn in the saddle-shaped part of the surface (where ∆2
is located) will have C(r) > 2πr. To grasp this, stand up and hold one arm out at right angles to
your body. If you spin around on your heels, the tip of your hand will trace out a horizontal circle.
Now repeat this pirouette, but this time wave your arm up and down as you turn; clearly the tip of
hand has travelled further than before. But this waving up and down is just what happens when
we trace out a circle on a saddle-shaped surface, and therefore both of the preceding formulas
yield K < 0, as they should.

2.2 The Circumference and Area of a Circle
•
21
[2.5] Nonspherical surfaces of revolution exist that possess constant positive curvature, but these necessarily have
either spikes or edges.
We have said that curvature has an “iron grip” on geometry, but just how absolute is this
control? For example, if we know that a patch of surface has constant positive curvature K =
(1/R2), must it in fact be a portion of a sphere of radius R? Well, take a ping pong ball and cut it in
half—now ﬂex one of the hemispheres slightly. Clearly we have obtained a new nonspherical patch
of surface, but since we have not stretched distances within the surface, geodesics and angles are
unchanged, and therefore according to the deﬁnition (2.3) the curvature K has not changed. Thus
we certainly can obtain at least patches of surface of constant curvature that are not extrinsically
spherical, although they all have identical intrinsic geometry.
Figure [2.5] illustrates that even if we restrict attention just to surfaces of revolution, the
sphere is not the only one of constant positive curvature. In fact there is an entire family of such
surfaces, with the sphere representing the boundary case between the two illustrated types (see
Ex. 22). Though they hardly look like spheres, an intelligent ant living on either of these sur-
faces would never know that she wasn’t living on a sphere. Well, that’s almost true: eventually
she might discover sharp creases or spikes at which the surface is not smooth, or else she might
run into an edge where the surface ends. In 1899 Heinrich Liebmann proved5 that if a surface of
constant positive curvature does not suffer from these defects then it can only be a sphere.
Ignoring such superﬁcial extrinsic differences, can two surfaces have constant positive cur-
vature K = (1/R2) and yet have genuinely different intrinsic geometries? More explicitly, if our
intelligent ant were suddenly transported from one surface to the other, could she devise an
experiment to discover that her world had changed? In 1839 Minding (one of Gauss’s few stu-
dents) discovered the answer: “no!” In other words, Minding found6 that if two surfaces have
constant positive curvature K = (1/R2) then their intrinsic geometries are locally identical to that of
the sphere of radius R.
We have discussed the fact that the inner rim of the pool ring in [2.2] has negative curvature,
but it is not constant negative curvature. Indeed, if C is the circle of contact between the ring and
the ground, separating the inner and outer halves, then it’s clear that the negative curvature K(q)

Chapter 2 Gaussian Curvature
must die away to zero as q approaches C, switching to positive if q crosses over C to the outer
half. (This is investigated in Act II: Ex. 23, page 89.)
[2.6] The pseudosphere of base radius R has con-
stant negative curvature K = −(1/R2).
In fact there do exist surfaces that have
constant negative curvature. Eugenio Bel-
trami (whom we shall meet properly shortly)
called all such surfaces pseudospherical, in
honour of the simplest exemplar, the pseudo-
sphere,7 shown in [2.6]. (The precise construc-
tion of this surface will be explained in Act
II, but it is the surface of revolution generated
by a curve called the tractrix, which was ﬁrst
investigated by Newton, in 1676.) If R is the
radius of the circular base of the pseudosphere
then (as we shall prove later) the constant neg-
ative value of the curvature over the entire
surface is K = −(1/R2).
While the name of this surface is too
established to be changed, it is perhaps unfor-
tunate. As you see, it is certainly not closed
like the sphere. In fact we shall prove later in
the book that no closed pseudospherical sur-
faces can exist. Further, we see that while the
pseudosphere extends upwards indeﬁnitely, it
has a circular edge at its base. It turns out to be
impossible to extend the pseudosphere beyond this edge while maintaining its constant negative
curvature. This is no accident: in 1901 David Hilbert proved that if a surface of constant negative
curvature is to be embedded within ordinary Euclidean 3-space then it must necessarily have an
edge beyond which it cannot be extended.
Minding’s result applies here too: if two patches of surfaces have constant negative curvature
K = −(1/R2) then their intrinsic geometry is identical to that of the pseudosphere of radius R.
To sum up, if a surface has constant curvature K (positive or negative) then this single number
determines the intrinsic geometry of the surface completely.
But what of more typical surfaces, within which the curvature varies? While the control
of the curvature remains very great, it is no longer absolute: it is possible for two surfaces to
have different intrinsic geometries while still having identical curvatures at corresponding points.
(A concrete example is provided in Ex. 19, p. 224.)
2.3
The Local Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Recall Harriot’s 1603 result (1.8) on the sphere: the angular excess of a triangle is the curvature times
the area, which we may think of as the total amount of curvature residing within the triangle.
The Local8 Gauss–Bonnet Theorem, as originally stated by Gauss in the Disquisitiones Gen-
erales of 1827, is a stunning generalization of this result to a geodesic9 triangle ∆on a general curved
7This surface, also known as the tractroid, was ﬁrst investigated by Huygens in 1693; see Stillwell (2010, p. 345).
8Here the word “local” does not signify inﬁnitesimal, but instead distinguishes this result from a subsequent “global” version
that applies to an entire, closed surface.
9In 1865 Bonnet generalized the formula to nongeodesic triangles, hence the name of the theorem. The most general version
of the theorem will not be proved until the end of Act IV (Ex. 6, p. 336).

[2.8] [a] Angular excess is additive: E(∆) = E(∆1) + E(∆2). [b] This persists if we continue subdividing
triangles: E(∆) = ∑E(∆i).
To see why this is so, ﬁrst recall our original
deﬁnition of curvature, (2.1). As the triangle ∆p shrinks towards a point p on S,
E(∆p) ≍K(p) A(∆p).
(2.7)
The key fact is that the angular excess is additive.
In [2.8a] a geodesic segment (dashed) has been drawn from one vertex of ∆to an arbi-
trary point on the opposite edge, thereby splitting ∆into two geodesic subtriangles, ∆1 and ∆2.
Observing that β1 + α2 = π, we ﬁnd that
E(∆1) + E(∆2) = [α + β1 + γ1 −π] + [α2 + β + γ2 −π] = α + β + γ1 + γ2 −π,
and therefore
E(∆) = E(∆1) + E(∆2).
These subtriangles may then be subdivided in their turn, and so on and so forth, yield-
ing [2.8b], and the additive property ensures that E(∆) = ∑E(∆i). As the subdivision becomes
ﬁner and ﬁner, the curvature varies less and less within each ∆i, approaching the constant value
Ki, and in this limit (2.7) yields E(∆) ≍∑KiAi, and so we arrive at the Local Gauss–Bonnet
Theorem, (2.6).

Exercises for Prologue and Act I
Prologue: Newtonian Ultimate Equality ( ≍)
1. (This is a model of how an “ultimate equality”—see Prologue—becomes an equality.) Sketch
a cube of side x, hence of volume V = x3. In the same picture, keeping one vertex ﬁxed, sketch
a slightly larger cube with side x + δx. If δV is the resulting increase in volume, use your
sketch to deduce that as δx vanishes,
δV ≍3x2 δx
=⇒
dV
dx ≍δV
δx ≍3x2

dx ≍3x2.
But the quantities in the ﬁnal ultimate equality are independent of δx, so they are equal:

dx = 3x2.
2. (This example is taken from Needham 1993.) Let c = cos θ and s = sin θ. In the ﬁrst quadrant
of R2, draw a point p = (c, s) on the unit circle. Now let p rotate by a small (ultimately van-
ishing) angle δθ. With one vertex at p, draw the small triangle whose sides are δc and δs. By

y-axis, and L.
(i) Use ordinary calculus to ﬁnd the position of L that minimizes A, and show that
Amin = 2ab.
(ii) Use Newtonian reasoning to solve the problem instantly, without calculation! (Hints: Let
δA be the change in the area resulting from a small (ultimately vanishing) rotation δθ
of L. By drawing δA in the form of two triangles, and observing that each triangle is
ultimately equal to a sector of a circle, write down an ultimate equality for δA in terms
of δθ. Now set δA = 0.)

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry
5. It is not known with certainty how the Babylonians generated the Pythagorean triples in [1.2],
but, 1500 years later, Euclid (around 300 BCE) was the ﬁrst to state and prove the most general
formulas for such triples. Half a millennium after that, Diophantus1 (around 250 CE) was the
ﬁrst to use a geometrical construction2 to systematically generate rational points on the unit
circle, meaning points with rational coordinates. These rational points can then be used to
generate Pythagorean triples, as follows.
(i) Let L be the line y = m(x + 1) through the point (−1, 0) of the unit circle C, and let (X, Y)
be the second intersection point of L and C. Prove that
X = 1 −m2
1 + m2
and
Y =
2m
1 + m2 .
(ii) Deduce that if the slope m = (q/p) is rational, then so are X and Y:
X = p2 −q2
p2 + q2
and
Y =
2pq
p2 + q2 .
(iii) Deduce that if (a, b, h) is an arbitrary Pythagorean triple, then
a
h = p2 −q2
p2 + q2
and
b
h =
2pq
p2 + q2 ,
for some integers p and q.
(iv) Deduce that the most general Pythagorean triple is given by the following formulas, ﬁrst
stated by Euclid:
a = (p2 −q2)r
and
b = 2pqr
and
h = (p2 + q2)r,
where p, q, r are arbitrary integers.
6. Use (1.3) to deduce that as the size of a triangle on the sphere shrinks to nothing, it ultimately
appears to the inhabitants of the sphere to be Euclidean, i.e., with angle sum equal to π.
7. Let p and q be distinct, nonantipodal points on the sphere, and consider the unique great
circle C through them. Let m1 and m2 be the midpoints of the two arcs into which C is split
by p and q. Show that the locus of points that are equidistant from p and q is the great circle
through m1 and m2 that cuts C orthogonally: this is the generalized “perpendicular bisector”
of pq. (Hint: while it is mathematically immaterial, it can be psychologically helpful to imagine
that the sphere has been rotated so that p and q lie on the equator.)
8. If the sides of a triangle on the unit sphere S2 are each less than π, show that the triangle is
contained within a hemisphere. (Hint: while it is mathematically immaterial, it can be psycho-
logically helpful to imagine that the sphere has been rotated so that one vertex is at the north
pole.)
9. One of the characteristics of the Euclidean plane is that it possesses regular tessellations: it
can be tiled (completely ﬁlled, without any gaps) by regular polygons. There are precisely
three such regular tessellations of the plane, using equilateral triangles, squares, or regular

this construction, launching new geodesics in different directions.

string taut) to create a circle of latitude of length C(r). Stick toothpicks into this circle at 16
evenly spaced points. Now wrap a piece of string or dental ﬂoss around the outside of the
approximately circular ring of toothpicks, and gently pull it tight, so that it follows the circle
of latitude on the surface of the fruit. With a pen, carefully mark the string at the start and
end of the circle. Unwrap it and stretch it along a ruler to measure the length C(r) between

A(∆).

narrow strips of the same kind that you use to generate geodesics, but create them all
with the same (accurately measured) width, W, perhaps 1/4 inch. Now ﬁll your ∆with

end-to-end on a ﬂat surface, and measure the total length, L. Then A(∆) ≍LW.

Mapping Surfaces: The Metric
4.1
Introduction
The perfect extrinsic symmetry of the sphere has the advantage of making it obvious that its intrin-
sic geometry is likewise uniform. By contrast, in [2.5] it’s certainly not clear that a ﬂexible but
unstretchable shape ﬁtted to the surface can be freely slid about and rotated on the surface, all
the while remaining fully in contact with the surface. But in fact this must be so, for the above
discussion shows that the actual shape of a surface in space is a distraction: these surfaces are
intrinsically indistinguishable from the sphere (at least locally).
From this point of view it would be better to have a more abstract model that captured the
essence of all possible surfaces having the same intrinsic geometry. By the “essence” we mean
knowledge of the distance between any two points, for this and this alone determines the intrinsic
geometry. In fact—and this was Gauss’s fundamental insight into Differential Geometry—it is
sufﬁcient to have a rule for the inﬁnitesimal distance between neighbouring points. This rule is
called the metric.1 Given this metric, we may determine the length of any curve as an inﬁnite sum
(i.e., integral) of the inﬁnitesimal segments into which it may be divided. Consequently, we may
also identify the geodesics of the geometry as the shortest routes from one point to another, and
we can likewise determine angles.
This leads to the following strategy for capturing the essence of any curved surface S (not nec-
essarily one of constant curvature). To avoid the distraction of the shape of the surface in space, we
draw a (cartographic) map of S on a ﬂat piece of paper. That is, we set up a one-to-one correspon-
dence between points bz on S and points z on the plane. Of course in the case of the spherical Earth
and the spherical night sky, mariners and astronomers have been devising such geographical and
celestial maps for thousands of years.
IMPORTANT NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY: In most of mathematics, “map” is synonymous with
“mapping” or “function.” However, when used as a noun, we shall always use “map” in the cur-
rent sense of a cartographic map. When we mean “mapping” or “function,” we shall say “mapping”
or “function”! That said, we will retain some of the traditional meaning when it comes to the verb:
e.g., the coordinate functions map this curve on the surface to that curve in the map.
In general, such a map of a curved surface cannot be created without introducing some kind
of distortion: if you peel part of an orange and try to press the patch of peel ﬂat on the table, it will
tear. Euler was the ﬁrst to prove (in 1775) the mathematical impossibility of a perfect map of the
Earth, in which all “straight lines” (geodesics) on the surface become straight lines in the maps,
and all terrestrial distances are represented by proportional distances on the map.
The preceding discussion explains this impossibility of a perfect map. A triangle on the
Earth’s surface has E ̸= 0, but if this triangle could be pressed ﬂat without altering distances then
its image in the map would be a Euclidean triangle with E = 0: a contradiction.
We will eventually discover that there exist deep and mysterious connections between non-
Euclidean Geometry and complex numbers. Let us therefore, from the very outset, imagine that the
ﬂat piece of paper on which we draw our map is in fact the complex plane, C.

[4.1] The central projection of the sphere maps geodesics to straight lines and circles to ellipses. The metric tells
us the local scale factor relating map distance ds and surface distance d bs.
Now consider the distance δbs separating two neighbouring points bz and bq on S. The points
bz and bq will then be represented by the complex numbers z = r eiθ and q = z + δz in this complex
plane, separated by (Euclidean) distance δs = |δz|. For a concrete example of such a map (to be
explained in a moment) look ahead to [4.1]. Once we have a rule for calculating the actual separa-
tion δbs on S from the apparent separation δs in the map, then (in principle) we know everything
there is to know about the intrinsic geometry of S.
The rule giving δbs in terms of δz is called the metric. In general, δbs depends on the direction of
δz as well as its length δs: writing δz = eiγ δs, so δbs ≍Λ(z, γ) δs, in which we remind the reader
that ≍denotes Newton’s concept of ultimate equality, which was introduced in the Prologue.
This relation is more traditionally expressed using the notation of inﬁnitesimals, as,
dbs = Λ(z, γ) ds.
(4.1)
According to this formula, Λ(z, γ) is the amount by which we must expand the apparent
separation ds in the map—located at z, and in the direction γ—to obtain the true separation dbs on
the surface S.
4.2
The Projective Map of the Sphere
Figure [4.1] illustrates the meaning of (4.1) for one particular method of drawing a map of the
southern hemisphere, called central projection. Imagine the hemisphere to be a glass bowl resting
on the complex plane at the origin 0, and imagine a light source at the centre of the sphere, c. Then
a light ray passing through bz on the hemisphere goes on to hit a point z in C. The resulting plane
map is the so-called projective map (or projective model) of the southern hemisphere.
If we draw a circle C on the hemisphere then the rays passing through it form a cone in space,
and hence they hit C in a perfect ellipse E. This is a very special and unusual property of this
particular method of drawing a map. However, it turns out2 that if C is an intrinsically deﬁned
circle on a general surface S (such as in [1.9]) then as its radius shrinks its image E in a general map
2Because if the mapping is differentiable then its local effect is a linear transformation.

4.2 The Projective Map of the Sphere

will ultimately be an ellipse, also. Returning to the perfect ellipses of the central projection, it’s
clear that E’s major axis will be radial, pointed directly away from the bowl’s point of contact with
the plane. In other words, if you imagine dz rotating about z, then Λ(z, γ) achieves its minimum
and maximum values at γ = θ and γ = θ + (π/2), respectively.
How we choose to draw a map of a surface depends on which features we wish to accurately
or faithfully represent. For example, [4.1] illustrates that the projective map faithfully represents
lines: a straight line in the map represents a great-circle geodesic on the sphere. But, the price that
we pay for preserving the concept of lines is that angles are not faithfully represented: the angle at
which two curves meet on the sphere is not (in general) the angle at which they meet on the map.
That said, there are in fact two orthogonal families of curves on the sphere that map to orthog-
onal curves in the plane: they are the circles of longitude and latitude. A circle of latitude (i.e., a
horizontal cross section of the hemisphere) maps to an origin-centred circle in the plane, and a
(semi-)circle of longitude (i.e., a vertical cross section of the hemisphere through its centre) maps
to a line through the origin. As claimed, these circles and lines do indeed meet at right angles. We
now use this fact to derive a formula for the metric of the sphere in terms of polar coordinates
(r, θ) in the projective map. It is not hard to accomplish this by calculation [exercise], but we shall
instead use the Newtonian form of geometric reasoning that was introduced in the Prologue, and
which we shall employ throughout this work.
See [4.2]. A small rotation of δθ in the plane rotates z a distance r δθ round the circle of radius
r and rotates bz by δ bs1 round a horizontal circle of latitude. If z then moves radially outward
by δr then bz moves north by δ bs2 along a vertical circle of longitude. By Pythagoras’s Theorem,
δbs2 ≍δ bs1
2 + δ bs2
2, and we shall now ﬁnd each of these terms separately. (Recall from the Prologue
that ≍is our symbol for Newton’s concept of “ultimate equality.”)
Let H = cz denote the distance in R3 from the centre c of the sphere to the complex number z,
as illustrated in [4.2]. Since bz is at distance R from c, and since the rotation causes bz and z to move
in proportion to their distances from the centre of the sphere:
d bs1
r dθ ≍δ bs1
r δθ = R
H.
Next, imagine H to be a string of ﬁxed length, attached to c. If we swing its free end at z
upward a distance ϵ in the plane perpendicular to the complex plane, then the northward motion
δ bs2 of bz will be in the same proportion as before. Furthermore, we see that the small vertical grey
triangle with edges ϵ and δr is ultimately similar to the large triangle 0cz with sides R and H. Thus,
δbs2

≍R
H
and

Finally, by the Pythagoras’s Theorem again, H2 = R2 + r2. So, reverting to the industry-standard,
inﬁnitesimal-based notation, the metric describing the true distance on the sphere in terms of the
coordinates in the projective map is given by
dbs2 =

(4.2)
In geography, the angle of latitude ϕ is usually deﬁned to be zero at the equator, but we
choose to instead measure it from a pole (as shown in both [4.2] and [2.4]). Returning to [4.1], we
can now quantify the amount of distortion induced by the map, by looking at the shape of the
small ellipse E. As C shrinks, you should now be able to conﬁrm [exercise] that

The Metric of a General Surface
Given the critical importance of maps in navigation, mathematicians have for centuries explored
many different methods of drawing maps of the Earth, and we shall meet an especially important
one shortly; other maps are explored in the exercises at the end of this Act. For now we wish
merely to point out that each such map has a different metric formula associated with it, despite
the fact that they all describe the same intrinsic geometry.
For example, the most common way of describing the location of a place on Earth is to supply
its longitude θ and latitude ϕ. Suppose we use these two angles to draw a very straightforward
kind of map in the plane, with θ along the horizontal axis, and ϕ along the vertical axis. That
is, if a particular house has longitude θ and latitude ϕ then in the ﬂat map we represent it by
the point with Cartesian coordinates (θ, ϕ). With the assistance of [2.4], you should now easily
ﬁnd [exercise] that the metric formula telling us the true distance on the sphere corresponding to
neighbouring points in the map is
dbs2 = R2 h

[4.3] On a general surface, draw two parameterized families of curves: “u-curves” (u = const.) and “v-curves.”
A point is then speciﬁed by the particular pair of curves (U, V) that intersect there, yielding a point z = U + i V
in the map. A small horizontal movement δu in the map ultimately produces a proportional movement δbs1 ≍
A δu on the surface, along a v-curve.
This certainly looks very different from our previous formula, (4.2), but we know that it in fact
describes exactly the same intrinsic geometry.
Even if we simply take our surface to be a ﬂat plane, an inﬁnite variety of metric formulas
are possible. For example, if we use regular Cartesian coordinates then dbs2 = dx2 + dy2, whereas
if we use polar coordinates then dbs2 = dr2 + r2dθ2.
Now let us investigate the form and meaning of the most general metric formula for a general
surface. Figure [4.3] illustrates how we may draw a general map of a patch of such a surface S.
For each point bz in this patch, our ﬁrst aim is to assign a pair of coordinates (u, v) so that it can be
represented by the complex number z = u + iv in the ﬂat map.
To get started, we simply draw, quite arbitrarily, a family of curves covering the patch, so that
one (and only one) curve from our family passes though each point bz on the patch. We now label
each of these curves with a unique number u, and agree to call these curves, with their assigned
u-values, the u-curves. The labelling can be done quite arbitrarily, except that we shall insist that
the numbering vary smoothly, in the sense that as we move over the surface across the u-curves,
the u-values should change at a deﬁnite rate, i.e., differentiably—more on this in a moment.
To complete the coordinate system, we now draw a second family of curves, again quite
arbitrarily, except that they should cross the u-curves and never coincide with them. Now label
these new curves with v-values, and, again, the v-values should vary differentiably, at a deﬁnite
rate (in the same manner as before); call these the v-curves. Thus, as illustrated, the point bz can
be labelled by the unique u-curve (say u = U) and v-curve (say v = V) that intersect there. So, in

36
•
Chapter 4 Mapping Surfaces: The Metric
the map, bz can now be represented as z = U + iV. Thus, as illustrated, u-curves are represented
in the map by vertical lines, while v-curves are mapped to horizontal lines.
Now that we have the coordinates on at least some patch of the surface, the task is to ﬁnd
the metric formula that gives the distance between neighbouring points. Suppose that in the
map we make a small movement away from z along δz = δu + i δv. By virtue of the differen-
tiable assignment of u-values to the u-curves, the small change δu produces—and we now come
to the deﬁnition of differentiable—a small movement δbs1 on the surface (along a v-curve) that is
ultimately proportional to δu, and we deﬁne A to be this proportionality constant at the point:
A ≡B bs1
Bu ≍δ bs1
δu .
This is important, so we reiterate: A is the local scale factor in the horizontal direction of the (u, v)-
map, the factor by which we must stretch a small horizontal distance in the map to obtain the true
distance on the surface.
There is also a way to visualize this without even looking at the map. If in [4.3] we imagine
that the u-curves have been drawn at small ﬁxed increments of ϵ (u = U, u = U + ϵ, u = U + 2ϵ, . . .)
then A can also be visualized as being inversely proportional to the crowding or density of the u-
curves. For the greater the crowding, the greater the change δu resulting from a given movement
δ bs1 on the surface.
In exactly the same way, the small change δv (while keeping u constant) produces a movement
δbs2 on the surface that is ultimately proportional to it, enabling us to deﬁne B to be the local scale
factor in the vertical direction of the map:
B ≡B bs2
Bv ≍δ bs2
δv .
Finally, as illustrated, we deﬁne ω to be the angle between the u-curves and the v-curves. Obvi-
ously this angle is not a constant: just as with the scale factors A and B, the angle ω is a function
of position.
We can now apply Pythagoras’s Theorem to the right triangle shown in the magnifying glass
of [4.3]:
δbs2
≍
(δbs1 + δbs2 cos ω)2 + (δbs2 sin ω)2
(4.5)
≍
(A δu + B δv cos ω)2 + (B δv sin ω)2.
(4.6)
After simplifying, and reverting to more standard, inﬁnitesimal-based notation, we ﬁnd that
The general metric formula for a general surface is
dbs2 = A2 du2 + B2 dv2 + 2 F du dv,
where
F = AB cos ω.
(4.7)
Assuming that you will eventually look at other books, we should immediately issue a NOTA-
TIONAL WARNING. In his original masterpiece of 1827, Gauss made the decision to write3 the
metric as
dbs2 = E du2 + G dv2 + 2F du dv,
3In fact Gauss wrote p and q in place of u and v, which later became the standard notation. We have chosen not to mind our
historical p’s and q’s.

4.4 The Metric Curvature Formula
•
37
In the subsequent centuries, almost every4 research paper and textbook on Differential Geometry
has slavishly perpetuated this E, F, G-notation. And yet we have seen that it is
√
E = A and
√
G = B
that have the simple geometric interpretation given above, and thus it should come as no surprise
that it is they (not E and G) that manifest themselves in many important formulas. The conse-
quence has been that a literature has arisen that is needlessly cluttered with square roots. We shall
therefore continue to employ the notation A and B (in place of
√
E and
√
G) throughout the book,
so we stress that when you look elsewhere you must translate using this
NOTATIONAL DICTIONARY:
E ≡A2,
G ≡B2,
F ≡AB cos ω.
(4.8)
Next, the general metric formula can be simpliﬁed as follows. It should be clear that once
we have drawn the family of u-curves we may then draw the family of orthogonal trajectories, and
then choose these as the v-curves. Since this construction insists that ω = (π/2), it follows that F = 0,
and hence,
Locally, we may always construct an orthogonal (u, v)-coordinate system on a
general surface; the metric then takes the form,
dbs2 = A2 du2 + B2 dv2.
(4.9)
Note, however, that it is generally not possible to cover the entire surface with a single (u, v)-
coordinate system, even if we do not insist on orthogonal coordinates. The problem that arises
is that two u-curves (and/or v-curves) may be forced to intersect, in which case the intersection
point would have to be assigned two different u-values. In fact, as will eventually see in Chapter
19, such problems are in fact inevitable on every closed surface, other than the doughnut.
For example, on the surface of the Earth, suppose we choose our u-curves to be circles of
latitude (though not necessarily with u = latitude). Then the orthogonal trajectories (i.e., the v-
curves) are necessarily the circles of longitude: great circles intersecting at the north and south
poles. Thus each pole must be assigned inﬁnitely many v-values.
4.4
The Metric Curvature Formula
Now suppose we are simply handed a metric formula (4.9), without any direct geometric knowl-
edge of the surface S it describes, nor the geometric meaning of the coordinates u and v,
themselves. What does this surface actually look like? As far as the intrinsic geometry of S is con-
cerned, this formula tells us everything, but only in principle. How can we actually extract useful
information from the formula?
If we knew the curvature K at each point then (via [2.3]) we would possess a clear under-
standing of the nature and shape of S. But since the metric knows everything about the intrinsic
geometry, it must (in particular) contain this information about the curvature. Thus the existence
of a formula for K is assured, and, by virtue of the symmetry of the metric formula, it is also clear
that the formula for K must be symmetrical under the simultaneous exchanges u ↔v and A ↔B.
4There are only a few exceptions, but their high pedigree perhaps lends a modicum of respectability to our choice of notation.
For example, Hopf (1956, p. 92) occasionally wrote E = e2 and G = g2, while Blaschke (1929, p. 162) occasionally employed
precisely our A, B-notation.

The road will be long, but we shall ultimately derive this formula with the simplicity and

tan’s Differential Forms) in Act V (Section 38.8.2). For now, though, we treat it as hyper-advanced
technology delivered to us from the future, like a phaser weapon from Star Trek’s twenty-third
century: we may ﬁre it at targets without beginning to understand (for now) how it works.6

Although the calculation is longer, we encourage you to try your own hand at applying this
formula to the projective metric formula (4.2) for the sphere; this too should yield K = +(1/R2).
Before moving on, we note another result we shall need later. The metric tells us how to
convert small distances in the map into distances on the surface. But how should we convert areas?
Well, in [4.3] a small rectangle in the map has area δu δv, and on the surface the corresponding
parallelogram has an area that is ultimately equal to (A δu)(B δv sin ω). Thus, using (4.7), the
formula for the inﬁnitesimal element of area dA on the surface is
dA =
p
(AB)2 −F 2 du dv.

If we specialize (as we usually shall) to an orthogonal coordinate system, so that F = 0, then this
formula simpliﬁes to
dA = AB du dv.

Conformal Maps
While the projective map of the sphere enjoys the advantage of preserving straight lines, for almost
all purposes it is much better to sacriﬁce straight lines in favour of preserving angles. A map that

the appearance of ﬁve distracting and unnecessary square roots!

preserves the magnitude and sense7 of angles is called conformal; if it preserves the magnitude
but reverses the sense, it is called anticonformal.
When we speak of the angle between two curves, we mean the angle between their tangents.
See [4.4].
In terms of the metric formula (4.1), a map is conformal if and only if the expansion factor Λ
does not depend on the direction γ of the inﬁnitesimal vector dz emanating from z:
Conformal map
⇐⇒
dbs = Λ(z) ds.
(4.13)
The great advantage of such a map is that
An inﬁnitesimal shape on the surface S is represented in a conformal map by a
similar shape that differs from the original only in size: the linear dimensions of
the shape on S are just Λ times bigger than the linear dimensions of the shape in
the map.
Indeed, eighteenth-century mathematicians used the expression similar in the small, in place of
the modern term conformal.
It is clear that (4.13) implies conformality, and to see that the converse is true (as claimed)
consider [4.5]. On the left we see a triangle shrinking down towards a point in a conformal map of
a surface. As it does so, the corresponding curvilinear triangle on the surface shrinks towards a
rectilinear triangle that—to use the language introduced in the Prologue—is ultimately similar:
δ bs1
δs1
≍δ bs2
δs2
≍Λ,
for some Λ, independent of the directions of the triangle sides δs1 and δs2. Thus, we see that
conformality implies (4.13).
In discussing the general metric formula (4.7), it was clear that we could always specialize
to an orthogonal coordinate system of u-curves and v-curves on the surface, corresponding to
orthogonal vertical and horizontal lines in the map. But at this stage the expansion factors A and B

in these directions were different, so an inﬁnitesimal circle in the map would be stretched into an
ellipse on the surface, and angles would be changed, in general.
We are now contemplating an even greater specialization in which the expansion factor is
the same in all directions, so that A = B = Λ, and inﬁnitesimal circles are mapped to inﬁnitesimal
circles, and angles are preserved. In this case, the (u, v)-coordinates are called conformal coordinates
(or isothermal coordinates), and (4.9) reduces to being a simple multiple of the Euclidean metric:
dbs2 = Λ2 [du2 + dv2].
(4.14)
This is such a strong restriction that one might fear that such maps might not even exist.
But as Gauss discovered in 1822, it is always possible to draw such a map of a general surface,
at least locally. Remarkably, the proof (see Ex. 8) depends on complex numbers—indeed, the
deep connection between Complex Analysis and conformal maps is the subject of the next
section.
The already elegant curvature formula (4.10) now becomes even more elegant.8 Recall that the
second-order Laplacian9 differential operator ∇2 is deﬁned by
∇2 ≡B2u + B2v.
(4.15)
8According to Dombrowski (1979, p. 128), this was the very ﬁrst curvature formula that Gauss discovered, recorded in his
private notes, dated 13th of December, 1822; see Gauß (1973, p. 381). Only in 1825 did he ﬁnd a formula in more general
(nonconformal) orthogonal coordinates, but, again, he kept this secret. Finally, in 1827, he found the completely general for-
mula in a nonorthogonal coordinate system, and only this horrendously complicated and ugly formula appears in print in the
ﬁnal masterpiece (Gauss 1827). We note that Gauss was positively proud of his deliberate and utterly deplorable (in our view)
habit of concealing his motivations and his path of discovery, declaring, “No architect leaves the scaffolding in place after
completing the building.”
9While physicists tend to denote this operator ∇2, mathematicians instead tend to write it as ∆. We have avoided the latter
notation because we often use ∆to denote a triangle.

Some Visual Complex Analysis
Even if we take the surface S to be the plane, so that we are dealing with conformal mappings of
the plane to itself, this turns out to be a deep and rich ﬁeld of study. Remarkably, such conformal
mappings are inextricably intertwined with the complex numbers, as we shall brieﬂy explain in
this section. (Additional concrete examples will appear later in this Act.) For a full exploration of
how the spectacular results of Complex Analysis emerge from this geometric foundation, we shall
immodestly recommend our ﬁrst book, Visual Complex Analysis (VCA).
Not only does every surface S possess a conformal map, it possesses an inﬁnite variety of
conformal maps! We begin by noting that there is nothing unique about the speciﬁc u-curves and
orthogonal v-curves that yield a conformal (u, v)-coordinate system with metric (4.14):
dbs = Λ(u, v) ds.
The real magic resides within the conformal mapping F : C →S itself. Given such a confor-
mal mapping F, we may create an inﬁnite variety of conformal (eu,ev)-coordinates on S simply
by rotating, expanding, and translating our (u, v)-coordinate grid in C, yielding (by applica-
tion of F) completely new eu-curves and orthogonal ev-curves on S. And this new, orthogonal
(eu,ev)-coordinate system on S is just as conformal as the original one was.
Let us introduce some notation to explain this fully. As is customary in Complex Analysis,
we shall think of z = u + iv as living in one copy of C, and its image ez = eu + iev under a complex
function z 7→ez = f(z) as living in a separate copy of C:
z 7→ez = eu + iev = f(z) = f(u + iv).
In the example just discussed, we have f(z) = aeiτz + w, which does an expansion by the (real)
factor a, a rotation through angle τ, followed by a translation by the (complex) number w.
If we compose this mapping f with the mapping F then we obtain the new conformal mapping
eF ≡F ◦f from C to S. If z moves along a small complex number δz then its image under the ﬁrst
mapping z 7→ez = f(z) will move along what we shall call δz’s “image” δez, emanating from ez, and
clearly
δez = aeiτδz .
(4.17)
Thus the length δs = |δz| is stretched by factor a, so that δes = |δez| = a δs. Next, under the second
mapping F (up to the surface S), the length of δes will be stretched by the conformal metric factor
Λ(ez). Thus the net magniﬁcation of δs under the new mapping eF is given by the product of these
two expansion factors:
dbs = eΛ(z) ds,
where
eΛ(z) = a Λ(ez).
But even this freedom barely scratches the surface, and to explain why we must simply quote
one fundamental fact from Complex Analysis; see VCA for details. Every familiar, useful real func-
tion f(x) you have ever studied (such as xm, ex, and sin x) has a unique generalization f(z) to
complex number inputs z. Picturing this, as before, as a mapping from one C to another C, the mir-
acle of Complex Analysis is that all of these naturally occurring mappings f(z) are automagically
conformal!

[4.6] The mapping z 7→f(z) = z2 (in common with all powers of z) is conformal, so the ﬁne grid of “squares” on
the left is mapped to approximate squares on the right, and these ultimately become perfect squares in the limit
that the size of the squares shrinks to zero.
For example, [4.6] illustrates the effect of
z 7→ez = f(z) = z2 =
h
r eiθi2
= r2 ei2θ,
which squares the length, and doubles the angle, of every point. As we see, the small “squares”
on the left are sent to similar “squares” on the right. Of course both sets of “squares” only become
actual squares in the limit that they shrink to zero. Likewise, the smaller the black T-shape on the
left, the more perfectly similar is the image T-shape on the right.
To see how remarkable this is, suppose you were to randomly write down two real functions
eu and ev (of the real variables u and v), and then perform a shotgun wedding between these two
functions to amalgamate them into a single complex mapping, f(u, v) = eu + iev. Then there is essen-
tially no chance that f will be conformal, and, as we shall now see, this also means that there is no
chance that f′(z) exists!
Let us begin to redo the earlier analysis, but now replacing the linear function f(z) with a
general mapping such that the derivative f′(z) exists. Such functions are called analytic. As we have
just indicated, such analytic mappings are extraordinarily rare, and yet they include essentially all
the useful functions that naturally arise out of mathematics and physics.
The analogue of (4.17) is now
δez ≍f′(z) δz = aeiτ δz .
(4.18)
The main difference is that now both the expansion factor a(z) and the angle of rotation τ(z) both
depend on the location z, rather than being constant throughout C. For example, in [4.6] we can
see that the black square adjacent to the real axis undergoes a smaller expansion than does the
white square in the corner of the grid, so a(z) is smaller at the black square than it is at the white
square. Likewise, it is clear that the black square undergoes no rotation, so τ = 0 there, but the
white square clearly does need to be rotated to obtain its image.

[4.7] The Amplitwist. The local effect of a differentiable complex mapping f(z) is an amplitwist (ampliﬁca-
tion and twist) described by the complex number f′(z) = amplitwist of f(z) = (ampliﬁcation) ei (twist) = aeiτ.
Any pair of tiny complex numbers δz1,2 emanating from z are amplitwisted equally to produce a pair δez1,2 ≍
aeiτ δz1,2 emanating from ez = f(z), and thus the angle γ between curves is preserved: f is conformal!
Equation (4.18) says that every tiny complex arrow δz emanating from z undergoes the same
expansion a and rotation τ to obtain its image arrow δez emanating from ez = f(z). See [4.7]. As illus-
trated, the angle between a pair of δz emanating from z will be the same as the angle between the
image pair of δez at ez = f(z), so it follows that differentiable complex mappings are automatically
conformal!
We see that the derivative f′(z) describes the local behaviour of the conformal mapping, and
in VCA we introduced (nonstandard) terminology to describe this geometrically. We call the local
expansion factor a the ampliﬁcation; we call the local angle of rotation τ the twist; and we call
the combined ampliﬁcation and twist (needed to transform the original shape into its image) the
amplitwist. In summary,
f′(z) = amplitwist of f at z = (ampliﬁcation) ei[twist] = a eiτ.
(4.19)
Before we turn to conformal metric formulas for surfaces in space, let us return to f(z) = z2
and show how we may use [4.6] to geometrically deduce its amplitwist.
Focus attention on the illustrated white square, with one corner at z = reiθ. Since the radial
edge through z at angle θ is mapped to a radial edge through z2 at angle 2θ, this edge has under-
gone a rotation of θ, so
τ = twist = θ.
To ﬁnd the ampliﬁcation a, consider the highlighted outer edge of the square (ultimately
equal to the arc of the circle though z, connecting the white dots). If this subtends angle δθ at the
origin, then its length is ultimately r δθ. Since angles are doubled by the mapping, the image arc
will subtend angle 2δθ, and since it now lies on a circle of radius r2, the length of this image edge
is ultimately r2(2δθ). Thus,
(image edge) ≍2r (original edge) =⇒a = ampliﬁcation = 2r.
We conclude that,
(z2)′ = amplitwist of z2 = (ampliﬁcation) ei[twist] = 2r eiθ = 2z,
a result that looks formally identical to the real result, (x2)′ = 2x, but which now means so much
more.

Chapter 4 Mapping Surfaces: The Metric
It is straightforward [exercise] to generalize this geometric argument to deduce that (zm)′ =
m zm−1. The amplitwists of other important mappings can likewise be deduced purely geometri-
cally; see VCA for details.
Now let us return to our main interest: conformal coordinates on a surface. We can now re-
place our simple linear function with our enormously richer class of differentiable (i.e., conformal)
mappings, f(z). Once again deﬁning eF ≡F ◦f from C to S, the new metric formula is
dbs = eΛ(z) ds,
where
eΛ(z) = (ampliﬁcation) Λ(ez) = |f′(z)| Λ(ez).
The existence of a conformal mapping F : C 7→S allows us to take any analytic mapping f : C 7→
C, and transfer it to S, so that it becomes a conformal mapping of S to itself. To see this, consider
the effect of
bf ≡F ◦f ◦F−1,
(4.20)
acting on S. First F−1 conformally maps S to C, then f conformally maps C to C, and ﬁnally F
conformally maps C back to S. Since each of the three mappings preserves angles, so do does their
composition, so bf : S 7→S is indeed conformal.
In the next section we shall meet an extremely important example of a conformal mapping F in
the case where S = S2. Later, we will use this F, via (4.20), to express the rotations of S2 as complex
functions (given by (6.10)). These rotations are not merely conformal, they are the (orientation-
preserving) isometries of the sphere.
4.7
The Conformal Stereographic Map of the Sphere
Hipparchus (c. 150 BCE) may have been the ﬁrst to construct a conformal10 map of the sphere
using the method illustrated in [4.8], which is called stereographic projection. Certainly, by 125 CE
Ptolemy (who is instead usually credited as the discoverer) was using it to plot the positions of
heavenly bodies on the celestial sphere.
The construction is similar to central projection, except now we imagine a point source of
light at the north pole N, and we project onto a plane that passes through the equator, instead
of touching the south pole.11 Then a light ray passing through bz on Σ goes on to hit a point z in
C, which we call the stereographic image of bz. Since this gives us a one-to-one correspondence
between points in C and points on Σ, let us also say that bz is the stereographic image of z. No
confusion should arise from this, the context making it clear whether we are mapping C to Σ, or
vice versa.
Note the following immediate facts: (i) the southern hemisphere of Σ is mapped to the interior
in C of the circle |z| = R, and in particular the south pole S is mapped to the origin 0 of C; (ii) each
point on the equator is mapped to itself; (iii) in C, the exterior of the circle |z| = R is mapped
to the northern hemisphere of Σ, except that N is not the image of any ﬁnite point in the plane.
However, it is clear that as z moves further and further away from the origin (in any direction),
bz moves closer and closer to N. In Complex Analysis, and later in this Act, one takes Σ to be the
unit sphere, and once its points are stereographically labelled with complex numbers, it is called
the Riemann sphere. The point N is then the concrete manifestation of the point at inﬁnity of the
so-called extended complex plane.
Figure [4.8] illustrates the fact that
10The conformality of the construction in [4.8] is not meant to be immediately obvious; it will be explained shortly, in [4.9].
11In some older texts the plane is in fact taken to touch the south pole; this [exercise] alters the map only by a constant scale
factor of 2.

4.7 The Conformal Stereographic Map of the Sphere

[4.8] Stereographic Projection: light from N shines through the glass sphere Σ, casting shadows onto C. The
shadow of a circle through N is a line in C that is parallel to the circle’s tangent at N.
The stereographic image of a line in the plane is a circle on Σ that passes through
N in a direction parallel to the original line.
(4.21)
To see this, ﬁrst observe that as z moves along the line shown in [4.8], the line connecting N to
z sweeps out part of a plane through N. Thus bz moves along the intersection of this plane with
Σ, which is a circle passing through N. Next, note that the tangent plane to Σ at N is parallel to
C. But if we slice through two parallel planes with a third plane, we obtain two parallel lines of
intersection. Therefore, the tangent at N to the circle is parallel to the original line, as claimed.
From this last fact it follows that stereographic projection preserves angles. Consider [4.9], which
shows two lines intersecting at z, together with their circular, stereographic projections, passing
through N.
First note that the magnitude of the angle of intersection between the circles is the same at
their two intersection points, bz and N. This is because the ﬁgure has mirror symmetry in the plane
passing through the centre of the sphere and the centres of the two circles.12 Since the tangents to
the circles at N are parallel to the original lines in the plane, it follows that the illustrated angles at
z and bz are of equal magnitude. But before we can say that stereographic projection is “conformal,”
we must assign a sense to the angle on the sphere.
According to our convention, the illustrated angle at z (from the black curve to the white one)
is positive; i.e., it is counterclockwise when viewed from above the plane. From the perspective
from which we have drawn [4.9], the angle at bz is negative (clockwise). However, if we were
looking at this angle from inside the sphere then it would be positive. Thus,
If we deﬁne the sense of an angle on Σ by its appearance to an observer inside Σ,
then stereographic projection is conformal.
12This will become crystal clear if you draw for yourself any two intersecting circles on an orange.

[4.9] Stereographic Projection Is Conformal. As the line rotates around z, the tangent at N of its circular image
rotates with it, so the angles at z and N are equal. But, by symmetry, the angle at bz equals the angle at N, so this
equals the angle at z, proving that stereographic projection is conformal.
HISTORICAL NOTE: It is remarkable that although stereographic projection had been well
known since Ptolemy ﬁrst put it to practical use around 125 CE, its beautiful and fundamentally
important conformality was not discovered for another 1500 years! This was ﬁrst done around 1590
by Thomas Harriot13—yes, the same Thomas Harriot who in 1603 discovered the fundamental
formula (1.3) linking angular excess and area on the sphere!
It follows from conformality that the metric takes the form (4.13). Thus a very small circle of
radius δbs on the sphere is ultimately mapped to a circle of radius δs in the plane, where
δbs ≍Λ δs.
See [4.10]. Our task now is to ﬁnd Λ.
Since Λ is independent of the direction of radius δbs emanating from bz, we are free to choose
this direction so as to make the analysis of the geometry as simple as possible. Thus, as illustrated,
let us choose the direction to be horizontal, along a circle of latitude.
Under the stereographic projection, this circle of latitude undergoes a uniform expansion to
yield an origin-centred circle through z, with δs pointing along it. As bz rotates around its circle of
latitude, z rotates with it, and their motions are in proportion to their distances from N. Thus,
δbs
δs = N bz
Nz .
Now consider [4.11], which shows the vertical cross section of [4.10] taken through N, bz, z.
The triangle NbzS is similar to N0z, so

Combining this with the previous equation, we deduce that

Stereographic Formulas
In this section we derive explicit formulas connecting the coordinates of a point bz on Σ and its
stereographic projection z in C. To simplify matters, we now restrict ourselves to the standard case
R = 1.
To begin with, let us describe z with Cartesian coordinates: z = x + iy. Similarly, let (X, Y, Z) be
the Cartesian coordinates of bz on Σ; here the X- and Y-axes are chosen to coincide with the x- and

y-axes of C, so that the positive Z-axis passes through N. To make yourself comfortable with these
coordinates, check the following facts: the equation of Σ is X2 + Y2 + Z2 = 1, the coordinates of N
are (0, 0, 1), and similarly S = (0, 0, −1), 1 = (1, 0, 0), and i = (0, 1, 0).
Now let us ﬁnd the formula for the stereographic projection z = x + iy of the point bz on Σ in
terms of the coordinates (X, Y, Z) of bz. Let z′ = X + iY be the foot of the perpendicular from bz to C.
Clearly, the desired point z is in the same direction as z′, so
z = |z|
|z′| z′.
Now look at [4.12a], which shows the vertical cross section of Σ and C taken through N and bz; note
that this vertical plane necessarily also contains z′ and z. From the similarity of the illustrated right
triangles with hypotenuses N bz and Nz, we immediately deduce [exercise] that

|z′| =

Although it is often useful to describe the points of Σ with the three coordinates (X, Y, Z), this
is certainly unnatural, for the sphere is intrinsically 2-dimensional. If we instead describe bz with
the more natural (2-dimensional) spherical polar coordinates (ϕ, θ) then we obtain a particularly
neat stereographic formula.

4.9 Stereographic Preservation of Circles

First recall that θ measures the angle around the Z-axis, with θ = 0 being assigned to the
vertical half-plane through the positive X-axis. Thus for a point z in C, the angle θ is simply the
usual angle from the positive real axis to z. The deﬁnition14 of ϕ is illustrated in [4.12b]—it is
the angle subtended at the centre of Σ by the points N and bz; for example, the equator corresponds
to ϕ = (π/2). By convention, 0 ⩽ϕ ⩽π.
If z is the stereographic projection of the point bz having coordinates (ϕ, θ), then clearly z =
r eiθ, and so it only remains to ﬁnd r as a function of ϕ. From [4.12b] it is clear [exercise] that the
triangles N bz S and N0 z are similar, and because the angle ∠NS bz = (ϕ/2), it follows [exercise] that
r = cot(ϕ/2). Thus our new stereographic formula is
z = cot(ϕ/2) eiθ.
(4.26)
In Exercise 33 we show how this formula may be used to establish a beautiful alternative interpre-
tation of stereographic projection, due to Sir Roger Penrose.
We will now illustrate this formula with an application that we shall need shortly: the rela-
tionship between the complex numbers representing antipodal points. Recall that this means two
points on a sphere that are diametrically opposite each other, such as the north and south poles.
Let us show that
If bp and bq are antipodal points of Σ, then their stereographic projections p and q
are related by the following formula:
q = −(1/p).
(4.27)
Note that the relationship between p and q is actually symmetrical (as clearly it should be):
p = −(1/q). To verify (4.27), ﬁrst check for yourself that if bp has coordinates (ϕ, θ) then bq has
coordinates (π −ϕ, π + θ). Thus,

Stereographic Preservation of Circles
This section is devoted to proving a single fact that is beautiful, surprising, and critically
important:
Stereographic projection preserves circles!
(4.28)
That is, not only does it send inﬁnitesimal circles to inﬁnitesimal circles (as all conformal maps
must do) but it sends a ﬁnite circle of any size and location on the sphere to a perfect circle in
14This is the American convention; in my native England the roles of θ and ϕ are the reverse of those stated here. For a lovely
example of the same diagram, but labelled per British convention, see Penrose and Rindler (1984, Vol. 1, p. 12).

the plane, although the centre on the sphere is not mapped to the centre in the plane. Note that
if the circle passes close to N then its image will be extremely large, and in the limit that it passes
through N this very large circle becomes the line shown in [4.8].
There exists a beautiful, completely conceptual, geometric explanation of (4.28)—see VCA,
page 142—but in our current haste we must instead settle for a calculation.
Every circle on the unit sphere Σ is the intersection of Σ with a plane whose distance from O
is less than one:
lX + mY + nZ = k,
where
l2 + m2 + n2 ⩾k2.
Substituting (4.25) into the equation of this plane we ﬁnd [exercise] that the circle of intersection
on Σ stereographically projects to a curve in C whose equation is
2lx + 2my + n(x2 + y2 −1) = k(x2 + y2 + 1).
If k = n then [exercise] the circle on Σ passes through N and its image is a line (as it should be!) with
equation lx + my = n. If k ̸= n then we may complete squares [exercise] to rewrite the equation as

We invoked the “the Devil’s machine”—see Prologue—and in just a couple of lines its work was
complete and the result was proved. Yet here we stand, bereft of any understanding of why the
result is true!)
From the preservation of circles we readily deduce from [1.5] that geodesics on the sphere
(the great circles) appear in the map as circles that intersect the equatorial circle at opposite ends
of a diameter.

Beltrami’s Insight
While the long investigation of parallel lines reached a climax around 1830 with the discovery of
Hyperbolic Geometry by Lobachevsky and Bolyai, a quite different parallel line—pun intended!—
of enquiry into Differential Geometry also reached a climax at almost the same time, with Gauss’s
[5.1] Eugenio Beltrami (1835–1900).
differential-geometric discoveries of 1827.
Just as lines on the sphere that are initially
parallel1 must eventually intersect, so too
did these two parallel lines of thought col-
lide, and in a powerful and fruitful way.
In 1868 the Italian geometer Eugenio
Beltrami (see [5.1]) recognized that a con-
nection might exist between two results
from these seemingly unrelated realms
of thought. On the one hand, he knew
of Lambert’s result (1.8)—later rediscov-
ered by Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai—
that in Hyperbolic Geometry the angular
excess of a triangle is a ﬁxed negative mul-
tiple of its area. On the other hand, he also
knew of the Local Gauss–Bonnet Theorem.
Beltrami had the insight that if one
could ﬁnd a surface of constant negative
curvature K = −(1/R2), then, by virtue of
(2.6), geodesic triangles constructed within
it would automatically obey the central
law of Hyperbolic Geometry:
E(∆) = −1
R2 A(∆).
Up to this point, the bizarre Hyper-
bolic Geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai
had languished in obscurity for close to 40 years, viliﬁed by some, but ignored by most. Now, at
last, Beltrami had an idea that could put it on a secure and intuitive foundation. Perhaps Hyper-
bolic Geometry simply was the intrinsic geometry of a surface of constant negative curvature! A
2000-year-old struggle was about to come to an end.

The Tractrix and the Pseudosphere
Beltrami already knew that the pseudosphere shown in [2.6] was indeed a surface of constant neg-
ative curvature K = −(1/R2), where R is the radius of its circular bottom rim. (We shall prove this
fact within this section.) Thus, more concretely, his insight was that the local geometry within this
surface obeys the laws of the abstract non-Euclidean Geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai. But
this abstract Hyperbolic Geometry is understood to take place in an inﬁnite hyperbolic plane
that is exactly like the Euclidean plane, obeying the ﬁrst four of Euclid’s axioms, but with lines
that obey the Hyperbolic Axiom (1.1), instead of Euclid’s Parallel Axiom.

[5.2] The Tractrix. A weight is attached to a
string of length R, laid out along the X-axis.
If the free end is moved up the Y-axis, the
weight is dragged along the illustrated curve,
called the tractrix.
While the constant negative curvature of the
pseudosphere ensures that it faithfully embodies
local consequences of this axiom, the pseudosphere
will not do as a model of the entire hyperbolic plane,
because it departs from the Euclidean plane in two
unacceptable ways: (1) the pseudosphere is akin to a
cylinder instead of a plane and (2) a line segment can-
not be extended indeﬁnitely in both directions: we
hit the rim. (As we noted earlier, Hilbert discovered
in 1901 that such a rim is an essential feature of all
surfaces of constant negative curvature—not intrin-
sically, but by virtue of trying to force the surfaces to
ﬁt inside ordinary Euclidean 3-space.)
Beltrami recognized these obstacles, and in the
next section we will see how he overcame them both,
in one fell swoop, by constructing a conformal map
of the pseudosphere. For now, though, we turn to the
construction of the pseudosphere itself.
Try the following experiment. Take a small
heavy object, such as a paperweight, and attach a
length of string to it. Now place the object on a table
and drag it by moving the free end of the string along
the edge of the table. You will see that the object
moves along a curve like that in [5.2], where the Y-
axis represents the edge of the table. This curve is
called the tractrix, and the Y-axis (which the curve
approaches asymptotically) is called the axis. The
tractrix was ﬁrst investigated by Newton, in 1676.
If the length of the string is R, then it follows that
the tractrix has the following geometric property: the segment of the tangent from the point of contact
to the Y-axis has constant length R. Newton identiﬁed this as the deﬁning property of the tractrix.
Returning to [5.2], let σ represent arc length along the tractrix, with σ = 0 corresponding to
the starting position X = R of the object we are dragging. Just as the object is about to pass through
(X, Y), let δX denote the very small change in X that occurs while the object moves a distance δσ
along the tractrix. From the ultimate similarity of the illustrated triangles, we deduce that

and therefore
X = R e−σ/R.

5.2 The Tractrix and the Pseudosphere
•
53
The pseudosphere of radius R, [2.6], may now be simultaneously deﬁned and constructed
as the surface obtained by rotating the tractrix about its axis. Remarkably, this surface was
investigated as early as 1693 (by Christiaan Huygens), two centuries prior to its catalytic role in the

cones, themselves built out of discs of radius R. The
top half has been removed to make the construction
easier to see.
acceptance of Hyperbolic Geometry, and the
constancy of its curvature was already known
to Gauss’s student Minding as early as 1839.
To demonstrate this constancy of the cur-
vature, let us ﬁnd the metric of the pseudo-
sphere. We choose very natural orthogonal
coordinate curves on the surface, as follows.
See [5.4a] (but please ignore [5.4b] for now).
To specify a point on the pseudosphere we
need only say (i) which tractrix generator it
lies on and (ii) how far along this tractrix
it lies. To answer (i) we specify the angle x
around the axis of the pseudosphere, and to
answer (ii) we specify the distance σ travelled
up the tractrix, starting at the base.
Thus the curves x = const. are the trac-
trix generators of the pseudosphere (note that
these are clearly geodesics2), and the curves
σ = const. are circular cross sections of the
pseudosphere (note that these are clearly not
geodesics). Since the radius of such a circle is
the same thing as the X-coordinate in [5.2], it
follows from (5.1) that
The radius X of the circle σ = const. passing through the point (x, σ) on the
pseudosphere is given by X = R e−σ/R.
An increase dx therefore rotates the point through the arc X dx, as illustrated. Thus, the
metric is
dbs2 = X2 dx2 + dσ2 = (R e−σ/R)2 dx2 + dσ2.
(5.2)
Finally, we may now apply the curvature formula (4.10) to this metric to obtain
K = −

thereby conﬁrming the crucial fact that Beltrami needed to interpret Hyperbolic Geometry:
The pseudosphere has constant negative curvature K = −(1/R2), where R is its
base radius.
(5.3)
This proposition carries such great mathematical and historical interest that in the course of
this book we shall attempt to understand it as directly and geometrically as possible. Indeed, in

Chapter 5 The Pseudosphere and the Hyperbolic Plane
later Acts we shall offer two geometric proofs: one using extrinsic geometry (Act III), and one using
intrinsic geometry (Act IV).
Before moving on, we can think of no better way to develop a feel (literally!) for the geometry
of the pseudosphere than to build your own! To see the idea behind the construction, imagine
rotating [2.6] to create the pseudosphere. In this process, no matter the position of the dragged
weight, the rotating string always traces out a cone (tangent to the pseudosphere) of ﬁxed slant length R.
Therefore, take as many sheets of paper as you can cut through with your scissors, and staple
them together along three edges, a few staples per edge. Find the largest bowl or plate that will ﬁt
inside the paper, and trace its circular edge. Now cut along this circle to produce identical discs;
repeat this step till you have at least 20 discs—the more, the better! Cut a small wedge from the ﬁrst
disc and tape the edges together to create a very shallow cone. Take the next disc and repeat with
a slightly larger wedge3 to create a slightly taller cone, but still with the same slant length. Place
this new cone on top the previous cone and repeat, and repeat, . . . . Behold your own personal
pseudosphere!
5.3
A Conformal Map of the Pseudosphere
As a ﬁrst step towards creating a map of an inﬁnite hyperbolic plane akin to the Euclidean plane,
we now construct a conformal map of the pseudosphere in C. In our map, let us choose the angle x
as our horizontal axis, so that the tractrix generators of the pseudosphere are represented by verti-
cal lines. See [5.4b]. Thus a point on the pseudosphere with coordinates (x, σ) will be represented
in the map by a point with Cartesian coordinates (x, y), which we will think of as the complex
number z = x + iy.
If our map were not required to be special in any way, then we could simply choose y = y(x, σ)
to be an arbitrary function of x and σ. But now let us insist that our map be conformal. Thus an
inﬁnitesimal4 triangle on the pseudosphere is mapped to a similar inﬁnitesimal triangle in the
map, and more generally it follows that any small shape on the pseudosphere looks the same
(only bigger or smaller) in the map. Having decided upon such a conformal map, it turns out
there is (virtually) no freedom in the choice of the y-coordinate. Let us see why. First, the tractrix
generators x = const. are orthogonal to the circular cross sections σ = const., so the same must be
true of their images in our conformal map. Thus the image of σ = const. must be represented by a
horizontal line y = const., and from this we deduce that y = y(σ) must be a function solely of σ.
Second, on the pseudosphere consider the arc of the circle σ = const. (of radius X) connecting
the points (x, σ) and (x + dx, σ). By the deﬁnition of x, these points subtend angle dx at the centre
of the circle, so their separation on the pseudosphere is X dx, as illustrated. In the map, these
two points have the same height and are separated by distance dx. Thus in passing from the
pseudosphere to the map, this particular line segment is shrunk by factor X.
However, since the map is conformal, an inﬁnitesimal line segment emanating from (x, σ) in
any direction must be multiplied by the same factor (1/X) = 1
Reσ/R. In other words, the metric is
dbs = X ds.
Third, consider the uppermost black disc on the pseudosphere shown in [5.4a]. Think of
this disc as inﬁnitesimal, say of diameter ϵ. In the map, it will be represented by another disc,
whose diameter (ϵ/X) may be interpreted more vividly as the angular width of the original disc
as seen by an observer at the same height on the pseudosphere’s axis. Now suppose we repeatedly
3In practice you may ﬁnd it easier simply to cut a radial slit, then overlap the paper to create the cone.
4Here, for once, we shall prefer the intuitive abbreviation “inﬁnitesimal,” instead of spelling out the rigorous “ultimate
equalities.”

translate the original disc towards the pseudosphere’s rim, moving it a distance ϵ each time.
Figure [5.4a] illustrates the resulting chain of touching, congruent discs. As the disc moves down
the pseudosphere, it recedes from the axis, and its angular width as seen from the axis therefore
diminishes. Thus the image disc in the map appears to gradually shrink as it moves downward,
and the equal distances 8ϵ between the successive black discs certainly do not appear equal in
the map.
Having developed a feel for how the map works, let’s actually calculate the y-coordinate
corresponding to the point (x, σ) on the pseudosphere. From the above observations (or directly
from the requirement that the illustrated triangles be similar) we deduce that

The standard choice of this constant is 0, so that

For future use, also note that an inﬁnitesimal rectangle in the map with sides dx and dy
represents a similar inﬁnitesimal rectangle on the pseudosphere with sides (R dx/y) and (R dy/y).
Thus the apparent area dx dy in the map is related to the true area dA on the pseudosphere by
dA = R2 dx dy

Chapter 5 The Pseudosphere and the Hyperbolic Plane
5.4
The Beltrami–Poincaré Half-Plane
We now have a conformal map of the cylinder-like, rimmed, pseudosphere: {(x, y) : 0 ⩽x < 2π, y ⩾1}.
To instead create a map of an inﬁnite hyperbolic plane, Beltrami knew that he must remove both
of these adjectives. Note that while different choices of R yield quantitatively different geometries,
they are all qualitatively the same, so there is no harm in making a speciﬁc choice:
In essentially all books and papers on Hyperbolic Geometry, the speciﬁc choice
R = 1 is made, so that K = −1. In this section we too shall make this conventional
choice.
If one wishes to return from this speciﬁc case to the general case, one need only insert
the appropriate power of R into the special case (R = 1) formulas. For example, if you are dealing
with area, then you must multiply by R2.
To remove the “cylinder-like” adjective, imagine painting a wall with a standard cylindrical
paint roller (of unit radius). After one revolution you have painted a strip of wall of width 2π, and
every point on the surface of the roller has been mapped to a unique point within this strip of ﬂat
wall. To paint the entire wall, you can simply keep on rolling! Now imagine that our paint roller
instead takes the form of a pseudosphere. To make it ﬁt onto the ﬂat wall you must ﬁrst stretch
out its surface, according to the metric (5.5), but then, just as before, you can keep on rolling
(let’s say horizontally). If a particle moves along a horizontal line on the wall, for example, the
corresponding particle on the pseudosphere goes round and round the horizontal circle σ = const.
The “cylinder-like” adjective has been successfully removed5 and we now have map {(x, y) : −∞<
x < ∞, y ⩾1}.
Our second problem, the pseudosphere’s rim, is solved by the conformal map with equal ease.
On the left of [5.5] is the image of a particle moving down the pseudosphere along a tractrix. Of
course on the pseudosphere the journey is rudely interrupted at some point bp on the rim (σ = 0),
corresponding to a point p on the line y = 1. But in the map this point p is just like any other,
and there is absolutely nothing preventing us from continuing all the way down to the point q on
y = 0, with the true distances dbs continuing to be given by the standardized hyperbolic metric,
dbs = ds
y .
(5.7)
Why stop at q? The answer is that the particle will never even get that far, because q is
inﬁnitely far from p! Consider the small disc D of diameter ds on the line y = 2 shown on the
left of [5.5]. Its true size on the pseudosphere is dbs = ds
y , and this is ultimately equal [exercise] to
the illustrated angle it subtends at the point h directly below it on the line y = 0. Now imagine D
moving down the pseudosphere at steady speed. Its apparent size in the map must shrink so that
its subtends a constant angle at h. In the map it hits y = 1 . . . and keeps on going!
Assuming it took one unit of time to go from y = 2 to y = 1, then in the next unit of time it
will reach y = (1/2), then y = (1/4), . . ., for these points are all separated by the same hyperbolic
distance:

[5.5] The hyperbolic diameter of the disc D is the (Euclidean) angle it subtends on the horizon. Thus, as it moves
downward, its image in the map shrinks. The discs on the right are all the same size, and a geodesic ab therefore
passes through the smallest number of them.
Thus, viewed within the map, the motion slows down and each successive unit of time only
halves the distance from y = 0, and therefore D will never reach it. (An appropriate name for
this phenomenon might be “Zeno’s Revenge”!)
At last, we now possess a concrete model of
The Hyperbolic Plane H2: the entire shaded half-plane y > 0, with metric
dbs = ds
y .
(5.8)
The points on the real axis y = 0 are inﬁnitely far from ordinary points and are not (strictly speak-
ing) considered part of the hyperbolic plane. They are called ideal points, or points at inﬁnity.
The complete line y = 0 of points at inﬁnity is called the horizon.
Although Beltrami discovered this map in 1868 (anticipating Poincaré by 14 years) it is now
universally known as the Poincaré half-plane. But in an attempt to restore some semblance of
historical balance, we shall doggedly refer to this map as the Beltrami–Poincaré half-plane.
Let us attempt to make the metric of this map more vivid. On the far right of [5.5] is a vertical
string of touching circles of equal hyperbolic size ϵ, as in [5.4]. To the left of this we have ﬁlled
part of the hyperbolic plane with such circles, all of equal hyperbolic diameter ϵ. Thus the hyperbolic
length of any curve is ultimately equal to the number of circles it intercepts, multiplied by ϵ. This
makes it clear that the shortest route from a to b is the one that intercepts the smallest number of
circles, and therefore has the approximate shape shown.
If you followed our earlier advice and built your own model pseudosphere, you can also
check the shape of a geodesic by stretching a string over its surface between two points at similar
heights. To investigate geodesics over regions where you cannot stretch a string, such as along the
tractrix generators themselves, you may instead employ the tape construction—(1.7), page 14—
which works everywhere.
Our next task is to conﬁrm the lovely fact illustrated in [5.5]: the exact form of such a geodesic
is a perfect semicircle that meets the horizon at right angles. The only geodesics that are not of this
form are the vertical half-lines (extending the tractrix generators), but even these may be viewed
as a limiting case in which the radius of the semicircle tends to inﬁnity.

5.5
Using Optics to Find the Geodesics
In order to explain the semicircular form of geodesics in the Beltrami–Poincaré half-plane model
of Hyperbolic Geometry, we shall draw on ideas from physics, speciﬁcally from optics.6 Our
inspiration derives from a law called Fermat’s Principle,7 discovered in 1662:
Light travels from one place to another in the least amount of time.
(5.9)
We shall begin our brief excursion into physics by using Newtonian reasoning8 to see how
Fermat’s Principle allows us to determine geometrically the abrupt bending of light (called refrac-
tion) that occurs when it passes from air into water (for example). This is why [exercise] your
spoon appears to bend when you stick it into a cup of tea.
In [5.6], a ray of light heads out from a in direction θ1 to the vertical, travelling at speed v1
through the air, hitting the water at p. It is then refracted into direction θ2, travelling through
the water at reduced speed v2, ﬁnally arriving at b. As early as 130 CE, Ptolemy conducted such
experiments and compiled a fairly accurate table of the pair of angles, θ1 and θ2. But the precise
mathematical relationship between the two angles eluded Ptolemy, as it would continue to elude
scientists for centuries to come.
Finally, in 1621 the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell van Royen (1591–1626) discovered
the correct law, now universally known as Snell’s Law:9
6This approach does not seem to be widely known. I thank Sergei Tabachnikov for pointing out to me that it was previously
published by Gindikin (2007, p. 324). The essential idea of using Fermat’s principle to ﬁnd a path that minimizes some quantity
goes back to Johann Bernoulli’s solution of the Brachistochrone Problem in 1697.
7First, this is the same Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) famous for discoveries in number theory, including Fermat’s Last The-
orem. Second, Feynman discovered that there is a beautiful quantum-mechanical explanation of this principle, a masterful
account of which can be found in Feynman (1985).
8We were honoured to realize that here we merely retraced the path taken by Feynman: see Feynman et al. (1963, Vol. 1,
26-3). Fermat himself ﬁrst gave an analytic proof and later a geometric one, but neither is as elegant as the present Newtonian
argument; both of Fermat’s proofs can be found in Mahoney (1994, pp. 399–401).
9As usual, the history is far more complex than the name suggests. The same Thomas Harriot that we met earlier also dis-
covered “Snell’s Law,” 20 years before Snell, but as with most of his discoveries Harriot was secretive, though this result he
did communicate to Kepler. But even Harriot had been beaten to the result—by 600 years! The Islamic mathematician and
physicist Ibn Sahl published it in 984 CE, and even used it to design sophisticated anaclastic lenses.

sin θ1 = n sin θ2,
where n = const.
(5.10)
The value of n (called the index of refraction) depends on the materials on either side of the
interface, but for air/water n ≈1.33.
It should be clear, at least qualitatively, that Fermat’s Principle requires the light to bend.
For if it were to travel in a straight line from a to b then it would waste valuable time travelling
relatively slowly through the water, instead of travelling quickly through the air. Quantitatively,
the amount of bending needed to minimize the ﬂight time will occur when the derivative of the
time (with respect to the position of p) is equal to zero.
Put geometrically, if the position of p minimizes the time, then an inﬁnitesimal displacement
ϵ of p should produce no change (to ﬁrst order in ϵ) in the time. But, as we see in [5.6], this dis-
placement causes the light to travel an additional distance through the air that is ultimately equal
to ϵ sin θ1, increasing the ﬂight time by an amount that is ultimately equal to (ϵ sin θ1)/v1. On the
other hand, by the same reasoning, the time saved in the water is ultimately equal to (ϵ sin θ2)/v2.
For the net time change to vanish, these two individual time changes must be equal. Thus, by
cancelling ϵ,
sin θ1
v1
= sin θ2
v2
.
(5.11)
This not only proves Snell’s Law (5.10), but it also makes a physical prediction, conﬁrmed by
direct experiment: the index of refraction is the ratio of the speed of light in the two materials,
n = (v1/v2).

[5.7] Snell’s Law applied to multiple
layers of material.
Now suppose that our water sits at the bottom of a
drinking glass. See [5.7]. How will the light bend when it
gets to the bottom of the water and enters the glass base,
where its speed is v3? Applying the same law as before,
sin θ1
v1
= sin θ2
v2
= sin θ3

.
Thus, more generally, if we have many thin horizon-
tal strips of material, the speed of light being vi within
each, then the entire journey of the light through the
layers is governed by the law
sin θi
vi
= const. = k.
Finally, let us go one step further and imagine the passage of light through a block of nonuni-
form material whose density is the same on each horizontal slice y = const., but which varies
continuously as y varies, the speed of light at height y being v(y), and the angle of the light there
being θ(y). Then the Generalized Snell’s Law is
sin θ(y)
v(y)
= k.
(5.12)
All very interesting, you say, but what has this to do with proving the semicircular form of
geodesics in the hyperbolic plane?! Well, suppose points ba and bb on the pseudosphere correspond
to the points a and b in H2, [5.5]. Imagine a particle that travels along different routes over the
surface of the pseudosphere from ba and bb, but always at the same constant speed, say, 1. As the
particle follows one of these paths, its image in the hyperbolic plane will follow a corresponding
path from a to b, but not with uniform speed: as we saw in [5.5], if a particle moves down the
pseudosphere at constant speed, its image in the hyperbolic plane slows down.

[5.8] The hyperbolic geodesics must satisfy the Generalized Snell’s
Law (sin θ/y) = k, and are therefore semicircles and half-lines
orthogonal to the horizon.
The next crucial observation
is that because the map is con-
formal, the slowing down only
depends on the location of the par-
ticle, not on the direction in which
it moves. For suppose we simul-
taneously launch from ba a mul-
titude of unit-speed particles in
all directions. After inﬁnitesimal
time ϵ they will form a circle of
radius ϵ centred at ba on the pseu-
dosphere, while in the hyperbolic
plane (5.8) tells us they will also
form a circle (centred at a) but of
radius ϵy, where y is the height of a. In other words, the speed of the particles emanating from a
is v(y) = y: the closer to the horizon we are, the slower the particles move.
Of course the time taken for each journey babb on the pseudosphere will be the same as the
time taken along ab in the hyperbolic plane. But on the pseudosphere, the geodesic route, being
the shortest, will also be the path of least time, and therefore the geodesic in the hyperbolic plane is
also the quickest route from a to b: geodesic motion in the hyperbolic plane automatically obeys Fermat’s
Principle, and its shape is therefore dictated by the Generalized Snell’s Law! Substituting v(y) = y
into (5.12), suddenly the answer becomes clear in [5.8]:
Geodesics in the Beltrami–Poincaré half-plane model of H2 satisfy (sin θ/y) = k.
If k ̸= 0 this is a semicircle of radius r = (1/k) centred on the horizon. If k = 0
then it a vertical half-line θ = 0.
(5.13)
Later, in Section 11.7.5, we will provide a second physical explanation of this important fact,
based on angular momentum!
5.6
The Angle of Parallelism
Now that we grasp the form of geodesics in the hyperbolic plane, we can return to our start-
ing point and visually conﬁrm in [5.9] the truth of the Hyperbolic Axiom (1.1). There are indeed
inﬁnitely many lines (shown dashed) through p that do not meet the line L. Such lines are said to
be ultra-parallel to L.
Separating the ultra-parallels from the lines that do intersect L, we see that there are precisely
two lines that fail to meet L anywhere within the hyperbolic plane proper, but that do meet it on
the horizon. These two lines are called asymptotic.10
As in Euclidean Geometry, the ﬁgure makes it clear that there is precisely one line M (dotted)
passing through p that cuts L at right angles (say at q). The existence of M makes it possible to
deﬁne the distance of a point p from a line L in the usual way, namely, as the (hyperbolic, dbs )
length D of the segment pq of M.
In fact, as illustrated, M bisects the angle at p contained by the asymptotic lines, though for
the moment this is far from obvious. The angle between M and either asymptotic line is called the
angle of parallelism, and is usually denoted Π. As one rotates the line M about p, its intersection

point on L moves off towards inﬁnity, and Π tells you how far one can rotate M before it starts
missing L entirely.
As Lobachevsky and Bolyai both discovered, there exists a remarkable relationship between
this angle Π and the hyperbolic distance D of p from L:
tan(Π/2) = e−D.
(5.14)
This is usually called the Bolyai–Lobachevsky Formula.
So, if p is close to L then Π ≈(π/2) and the Euclidean result almost holds: about half the rays
(half-lines) emanating from p eventually hit L. Of course in Euclidean Geometry exactly half the
rays hit L, no matter how far p is from L. But in the hyperbolic plane we see—qualitatively in [5.9]
and quantitatively in (5.14)—that as p recedes from L, the proportion of rays emanating from p
that hit L shrinks to zero!
It is essential to realize that from the point of view of microscopic inhabitants of the
pseudosphere, or the true hyperbolic plane, there is no way to distinguish between geodesics—
every straight line is like every other. Thus, intrinsically, geodesics that are represented in our
map by vertical half-lines are completely indistinguishable from geodesics represented by semi-
circles.
But what about the fact that the semicircles have two ends on the horizon, whereas the ver-
tical lines appear to only have one? The answer is that, in addition to the points on the horizon,
there is one more point at inﬁnity, and all the vertical lines meet there. According to (5.8), as we
move upward along two neighbouring, vertical lines, the distance between them dies away as
(1/y), and they converge to a single point at inﬁnity; this is particularly vivid on the pseudo-
sphere.
Having stressed that the two manifestations of lines in the map are mathematically identical,
we now do an about-face and also stress that psychologically they are not identical. That is, standing
outside this non-Euclidean world and looking in via our map, we may ﬁnd it easier to see that some
mathematical relation holds if we look at the simpler (but less typical) case where a line is vertical
rather than semicircular.
What gives this idea real power is the existence of rigid motions of H2, such as rotations
about a point. Such distance-preserving motions are called isometries, and they are the subject
of the next chapter. For now, we note that the existence of isometries makes it possible to rigidly

move any hyperbolic ﬁgure involv-
ing a semicircular line so that it
appears in the map as a vertical line.
For example, returning to [5.9],
we may rotate H2 about p until L
becomes vertical, in which case the
diagram now takes on the simpler
form shown in [5.10]. An immedi-
ate payoff is that now we can see
that M bisects the angle between
the asymptotics at p: simply ver-
ify all the marked angles [exercise].
But this means that M must indeed
have bisected the angle when L was
in general position in [5.9], before we
did the rotation.
By the same token, the simpler
geometry of this new picture also
makes it much easier to conﬁrm
the truth of the Bolyai–Lobachevsky
Formula, (5.14); for details, see VCA,
p. 306.
5.7
The Beltrami–Poincaré Disc
The Beltrami–Poincaré upper half-plane with metric dbs = ds/y is merely one way of depicting the
abstract hyperbolic plane H2. Several alternative models exist.11 While these different models are,
by deﬁnition, all intrinsically identical, they are not psychologically identical: a particular fact or
formula can be very hard to see in one model, yet be transparent in another. Facility in switching
between models is therefore a valuable skill when trying to come to grips with the wonders of
Hyperbolic Geometry.
For now we wish only to illustrate one particularly useful and famous model. The new model
is drawn in the unit disc; see [5.11]. Like the upper half-plane, this is a conformal model, and
geodesics are again represented as arcs of circles that meet the horizon at right angles, but now
the inﬁnitely distant horizon is the boundary of this disc, the unit circle. If r is distance from the
centre of the disc, the new metric formula is (see Ex. 25)
dbs =
2
1 −r2 ds.
(5.15)
For further details we refer you to VCA or to Stillwell (2010). You can at least conﬁrm that this
is indeed H2 by using the conformal curvature formula (4.16) to verify [exercise] that this surface
has constant negative curvature K = −1.
It was Beltrami who ﬁrst discovered this model, announcing it in the same 1868 paper as the
half-plane model; see Stillwell (1996). Again, Poincaré rediscovered this model 14 years later, and
again it became universally known as the “Poincaré disc.” However, as before, we shall steadfastly

[5.11] The Beltrami–Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane. The background is Escher’s Circle Limit I;

boundary circle (the horizon). Clearly the Hyperbolic Axiom (1.1) is satisﬁed, and E(∆) < 0. M. C. Escher’s

insist upon giving credit to both by calling this the Beltrami–Poincaré disc; less contentiously, it
is also called the conformal disc model.
In 1958 the famous British geometer H.S.M. Coxeter (1907–2003) introduced the Dutch artist
M. C. Escher (1898–1972) to the conformal disc model of H2. This led Escher to create his famous
Circle Limit series of woodcuts,12 the ﬁrst of which is reproduced (deliberately faintly) in [5.11],
but with hyperbolic lines prominently superimposed. (The idea for this diagram came directly
from Penrose (2005, Fig. 2.12).) We see, for example, that there are indeed inﬁnitely many lines
through p that fail to meet L, in accord with the Hyperbolic Axiom (1.1). Diameters of the circle
are also hyperbolic lines, so the illustrated triangle ∆is a genuine hyperbolic triangle. Note that it
is visually apparent (and easily provable) that E(∆) < 0, as it should be.
As you stare at this, try to imagine yourself as one of the ﬁsh. You are exactly the same size
and shape as every other ﬁsh, and you can swim in a straight line forever without ever seeing
any change in your surroundings or in your fellow ﬁsh. But looking into the map from outside,
the compression of distances makes you appear to be swerving along a circular path and to be
shrinking as you go. In fact if δ ≡(1 −r) is the illustrated Euclidean distance of ﬁsh from the hori-
zon, and we look at a point close to the edge of the map, we ﬁnd that (5.15) implies [exercise] that
the (apparent size of ﬁsh) ∝δ.
In Exercise 25 you will see that there is in fact a simple conformal transformation that relates
this new disc model to our previous conformal half-plane model, thereby explaining the confor-
mality of the new disc model. Computer application of this transformation to Escher’s original art
[5.11] yields [5.12], a picture that Escher himself never created, but which he surely would have
appreciated. (This image is reproduced, with permission, from Stillwell (2005, p. 195).)

Let us pause, catch our breath, and look back at how far we have come. The story13 with
which we began this book has arrived at a happy conclusion, an ending of sorts. For 2000 years
Euclidean Geometry had been vexed by confusion and doubt surrounding the Parallel Axiom.
Now Beltrami’s concrete vindication of Hyperbolic Geometry as a legitimate alternative had at
last brought about clarity and cathartic release from two millennia of mathematical tension. What
a splendid place to end Act II!

Chapter 6
Isometries and Complex Numbers
6.1
Introduction
Great mathematical ideas not only put past mysteries to rest, they also reveal new ones: tunnels at
the end of the light! It is to such glimpses of strange new connections with other areas mathematics
and physics that we now turn.
The ﬁrst of these new mysterious connections is between the three geometries of constant
curvature (Euclidean, Spherical, and Hyperbolic) and the complex numbers.
We have already asked you to imagine our maps of curved surfaces as being drawn in the
complex plane. However, the astute reader will have noticed that, up to this point, we have
made but slight use of the essential structure of the complex numbers. That is about change. First,
however, we need to make some more general observations about the very concept of an isometry.
Isometries necessarily preserve the magnitude of every angle, and the ones that also pre-
serve the sense of the angle (clockwise versus counterclockwise) are called direct, while those that
reverse the sense are called opposite. Thus a direct isometry is a very special kind of confor-
mal mapping, while an opposite isometry is a very special kind of anticonformal mapping. For
example, in the plane, a rotation is a direct isometry, whereas a reﬂection in a line is an opposite
isometry.
Next we observe that, under the operation of composition,
The complete set of isometries (both direct and opposite) of a given surface S
automatically has the structure of a group, G(S).
To conﬁrm this, let e = (do nothing) and let a, b, c be any three isometries of S. Then the group
axioms1 are satisﬁed:
•
Since e clearly preserves distances, e ∈G(S), and since a ◦e = a = e ◦a, we deduce that e is the
group identity.
•
If we apply a and then apply b (both of which preserve distances) then the net transformation
also preserves distances: b ◦a ∈G(S).
•
Since the transformation a preserves distances, its inverse does too: a−1 ∈G(S).
•
Composition of transformations (not necessarily isometries) is associative:
(a ◦b) ◦c = a ◦(b ◦c).
Note that (under composition) direct and opposite isometries behave like (+) and (−) under
multiplication: (+)(+) = (+), (+)(−) = (−), and (−)(−) = (+). It follows that
The direct isometries form a subgroup G+(S) of the full group G(S).
1These deﬁne the mathematical concept of a group. Even if you have not met this concept before, you can still follow along by
simply accepting the following axioms as the deﬁnition.
65

•
Chapter 6 Isometries and Complex Numbers
On the other hand, the opposite isometries do not form a group at all. But they do belong to the
full group G(S), so how are they related to G+(S)?
Let ξ be a speciﬁc, ﬁxed opposite isometry; then ξ−1 is too. Let ζ be a general opposite
isometry—think of this varying over all possible opposite isometries. Then ξ−1 ◦ζ ∈G+(S) ⇒ζ ∈
ξ ◦G+(S). By the same token, ζ ∈G+(S) ◦ξ. Thus,
If ξ is any opposite isometry, the complete set of opposite isometries is ξ ◦G+(S) =
G+(S) ◦ξ, and the full symmetry group is therefore
G(S) = G+(S) ∪[ξ ◦G+(S)] = G+(S) ∪[G+(S) ◦ξ] .
(6.1)
Does every surface S possess a nontrivial group G(S) of isometries? No, for an isometry
must also preserve the curvature. Suppose an isometry carries a very small (ultimately vanishing)
triangle ∆at p to a congruent triangle ∆′ at p′. Then
K(p) ≍E(∆)
A(∆) = E(∆′)
A(∆′) ≍K(p′).
Thus an irregular surface like the squash depicted in [1.9] will not have any isometries.2
On the other hand, it is not necessary for the curvature to be constant over S for isometries
to exist.3 For example, consider any surface of revolution. By its very construction, this surface
of (typically) nonconstant curvature does admit a group of isometries. Rotations about the sur-
face’s axis are direct isometries, and reﬂections in planes passing through this axis are opposite
isometries; additional isometries may exist as well.
The greater the symmetry of S, the bigger the group of isometries, and the greatest symmetry
occurs in the three cases of constant curvature: K = 0, K > 0, and K < 0. Extrinsically, the archetypal
surfaces possessing these geometries are the Euclidean plane, the sphere, and the pseudosphere.
However, the concept of an isometry belongs to intrinsic geometry; so, for example, the Beltrami–
Poincaré half-plane map of H2 is in fact a much better depiction of Hyperbolic Geometry than is
the pseudosphere, and it is this map (or the conformal disc model) that will be relevant in what
follows.
We will reﬁne the statement shortly, but here in brief is the startling connection between these
three, maximally symmetric geometries and the complex numbers—the Main Result:
All three geometries of constant curvature have symmetry groups G+(S) (of direct
isometries) that are subgroups of the group of Möbius transformations of the
complex plane, z 7→M(z) = az+b
cz+d , where a, b, c, d are complex constants.
(6.2)
2I have not thought through precisely how to quantify the degree of irregularity needed to preclude the existence of isometries.
A starting point might be to observe that if the value of K(p) is uniquely attained at p, then p must be a ﬁxed point of any
putative isometry—it has nowhere to go! Three such points would result in three ﬁxed points, and I would guess this would
preclude nontrivial isometries.
3We will be concerned with inﬁnite, continuous sets of isometries, but it is also possible to have a ﬁnite set of isometries, even
for a smooth surface. For example, consider the symmetries of a gaming die (a cube with its edges and corners rounded off).

tant in modern mathematics (and, as we shall see, in physics too). We now summarize5 some facts
that we shall need concerning these transformations.

Note that if (ad −bc) = 0 then M(z) crushes the entire complex plane down to a single image
point (a/c); in this exceptional case M(z) cannot be undone, and is called singular. In dis-
cussing Möbius transformations we shall therefore always assume that M(z) is nonsingular,
meaning that it is invertible (i.e., (ad −bc) ̸= 0).
Of the four transformations above, only the second one (the reciprocal mapping) is
unfamiliar and requires further investigation.
•
Inversion in a Circle. This mapping z 7→(1/z) holds the key to understanding the Möbius
transformations. As we did in VCA, we shall call this reciprocal mapping complex inversion.
In polar coordinates, the image of z = r eiθ under complex inversion is 1/(r eiθ) = (1/r) e−iθ:
the new length is the reciprocal of the original, and the new angle is the negative of the origi-
nal. See [6.1a]. Note how a point outside the unit circle C is mapped to a point inside C, and
vice versa. Figure [6.1a] also illustrates a particularly fruitful way of decomposing complex
inversion into a two-stage process:
1. Send z = r eiθ to the point that is in the same direction as z but that has reciprocal length,
namely the point (1/r) eiθ = (1/z).

2. Apply complex conjugation (i.e., reﬂection in the real axis), which sends (1/z) to (1/z) =
(1/z).
Check for yourself that the order in which we apply these two mappings is immaterial. (This
is atypical: in (6.3), for example, the order certainly does matter.)
While stage (2) is geometrically trivial, we shall see that the mapping in stage (1) is ﬁlled
with surprises; it is called6 geometric inversion, or simply inversion. Clearly, the unit circle C
plays a special role for this mapping: the inversion interchanges the interior and exterior of
C, while each point on C remains ﬁxed (i.e., is mapped to itself). For this reason we write the
mapping as z 7→IC(z) = (1/z), and we call IC (a little more precisely than before) “inversion
in C.”
This added precision in terminology is important because, as illustrated in [6.1b], there
is a natural way of generalizing IC to inversion in an arbitrary circle K (say with centre q and
radius R). Clearly, this “inversion in K,” written z 7→ez = IK(z), should be such that the interior
and exterior of K are interchanged, while each point on K remains ﬁxed. If ρ is the distance
from q to z, then we deﬁne ez = IK(z) to be the point in the same direction from q as z, and at distance
(R2/ρ) from q. Check for yourself that this deﬁnition is forced on us if we imagine this ﬁgure
to be [6.1a] expanded by factor R.
•
Inversion Is Equatorial Reﬂection of the Riemann Sphere. If we stereographically suck the
complex numbers off the plane and onto the unit sphere, thereby creating the Riemann sphere,
then the effect of inversion becomes startlingly simple:
Inversion of C in the unit circle induces a reﬂection of the Riemann sphere in its
equatorial plane, C.
(6.4)
To conﬁrm (6.4), see [6.2], which shows a vertical cross section of the Riemann sp-
here. The point z is stereographically projected to bz, reﬂected across the equatorial plane to bez,
and ﬁnally projected to ez. We see [exercise] that the triangles N0ez and z0N are similar, and so
| ez |/1 = 1/|z|. Thus, ez = IC(z), as claimed.
Note that this ﬁgure also shows that inversion in the unit circle is equivalent to stereo-
graphic projection from the south pole, followed by stereographic projection from the north
pole (or vice versa).
6Another common and appropriate name is reﬂection in a circle (for reasons that will become apparent shortly). In older
works it is often called “transformation by reciprocal radii.”

[6.3] Complex inversion in the unit circle C sends the oriented circle K to (1/K), and the shaded region to
the left of the direction of travel along K is mapped to the shaded region to the left of the direction of travel
along (1/K).
•
Inversion Preserves Circles. By virtue of (4.28), a circle K in C projects to a circle on Σ, and the
anticonformal reﬂection of the sphere in its equatorial plane (inversion) maps this to another
circle on Σ, which ﬁnally projects back to a circle IC(K) in C. See [6.3].
If we instead begin with a line, we get a circle on Σ passing through N (recall [4.21]) which
reﬂects to a circle through S, which projects back to a circle in C passing through 0. Conversely,
because inversion swaps points, a circle K through 0 is sent to a line IC(K). See [6.4].
We may think of the second result as a limiting case of the ﬁrst, a line being a limiting
form of a circle. Indeed, on the Riemann sphere a line is literally a circle that happens to pass
through the north pole. With this uniﬁed language in place, we may summarize by saying,
Inversion is anticonformal and maps circles to circles.
(6.5)
•
Complex Inversion is a Rotation of the Riemann Sphere. If we now follow this inversion by
conjugation, z 7→z, then the net effect is complex inversion. But the effect of conjugation on
the Riemann sphere is another reﬂection, this time in the vertical plane passing through the
real axis. As you may easily check (perhaps with the assistance of an orange) the net effect of
these two reﬂections in perpendicular planes passing through the real axis is a rotation about
that axis:
Complex inversion, z 7→(1/z), is a rotation of the Riemann sphere, through angle
π about the real axis. It is therefore conformal and maps circles to circles.
(6.6)
We can also provide a second proof using the stereographic formula, (4.26). First check
for yourself that if bz has coordinates (ϕ, θ) then rotating it by π about the real axis carries
it to a point with coordinates (π −ϕ, −θ). So this rotated point corresponds to the complex

[6.4] Complex inversion in the unit circle C sends the oriented circle K to (1/K), and the shaded region to
the left of the direction of travel along K is mapped to the shaded region to the left of the direction of travel
along (1/K).
Figure [6.3] illustrates the effect of both inversion and complex inversion on an oriented
circle K. Note how the darkly shaded region to the left of the direction of travel along K (the
interior of K) is mapped to the region to the left of the direction of travel along (1/K). If K
contains 0 then the orientation of (1/K) is reversed by the mapping, but the rule “left 7→left”
remains in force. Check all this for yourself, both directly and by using (6.6).
Figure [6.4] illustrates the same phenomenon in the case where K passes through 0 (the
south pole) and (1/K) is therefore a line (a circle through the north pole).
Observe that this provides a conformal mapping between a half-plane and the interior
of a disc, and this is in fact precisely how the conformal disc model [5.11] of the hyper-
bolic plane is constructed from the conformal half-plane model [5.12]. (The explicit Möbius
transformation is given in Exercise 25, and the full explanation is given in VCA, pp. 315–317.)
•
Preservation of Angles and Circles. As illustrated in [6.3] and [6.4], it follows immediately
from (6.3) and (6.6) that, using the new generalized sense of “circle,”
Möbius transformations are conformal and map each oriented circle K to an ori-
ented circle eK in such a way that the region to the left of K is mapped to the region
to the left of eK.
(6.7)
•
Matrix Representation. Geometrically, the Riemann sphere allows us to think of ∞like any
other point—it’s simply the north pole. From (6.6), we see that complex inversion induces
a rotation that swaps the north and south poles, so the statements 0 = 1/∞and ∞= 1/0 are
literally true.
It would be nice if we could likewise do away with the exceptional role of inﬁnity at
the algebraic level. To do so, we adapt an idea from Projective Geometry, describing each
point on the Riemann sphere as the ratio of a pair of complex numbers (z1, z2) living in C2:
z = (z1/z2).
The ordered pair of complex numbers7 [z1, z2] are called projective coordinates or homo-
geneous coordinates of z. In order that this ratio be well deﬁned we demand that [z1, z2] ̸= [0, 0].
7We note, sadly only in passing, that [z1, z2] may also be viewed as the coordinate representation of a 2-spinor. This concept
lies at the heart of huge body of fundamental, pioneering work by Sir Roger Penrose—see Penrose and Rindler (1984) for

6.2 Möbius Transformations
•
71
To each ordered pair [z1 arbitrary, z2 ̸= 0] there corresponds precisely one ordinary, ﬁnite point
z = (z1/z2), but to each point z there corresponds an inﬁnite set of projective coordinates,
[kz1, kz2] = k[z1, z2], where k is an arbitrary nonzero complex number. For example, i can be
represented as [1 + i, 1 −i], as [−1, i], or as [3 + 2i, 2 −3i], to give just three examples out of
inﬁnitely many.
The point at inﬁnity, on the other hand, can now be represented as an unremarkable pair
of the form [z1, 0].
Just as a linear transformation of R2 is represented by a real 2 × 2 matrix, so a linear
transformation of C2 is represented by a complex 2 × 2 matrix:
"
z1
z2
#
7−→
"
w1
w2
#
=
"
a
b
c
d
# "
z1
z2
#
=
"
a z1 + b z2
c z1 + d z2
#
.
But if [z1, z2] and [w1, w2] are thought of as the projective coordinates in C2 of the point z =
(z1/z2) in C and its image point w = (w1/w2), then the above linear transformation of C2
induces the following (nonlinear) transformation of C:
z = z1
z2
7−→
w = w1
w2
= a z1 + b z2
c z1 + d z2
= a (z1/z2) + b
c (z1/z2) + d = az + b
cz + d .
This is none other than the most general Möbius transformation!
Thus to every Möbius transformation M(z) there corresponds a 2 × 2 matrix [M],
M(z) = az + b
cz + d
←→
[M] =
"
a
b
c
d
#
,
and we deduce that the matrix of the composition of two Möbius transformations is the
product of the corresponding matrices:
[M2 ◦M1] = [M2] [M1].
(6.8)
Likewise, the inverse of a Möbius transformation can be found by taking the inverse of the
corresponding matrix:
[M−1] = [M]−1.
(6.9)
It follows easily [exercise] that the nonsingular Möbius transformations do indeed form a
group (as was implicitly claimed earlier).
Since the coefﬁcients of the Möbius transformation are not unique, neither is the corre-
sponding matrix: if k is any nonzero constant, then the matrix k[M] corresponds to the same
Möbius transformation as [M]. However, if [M] is normalized by imposing (ad −bc) = 1, then
there are just two possible matrices associated with a given Möbius transformation: if one
is called [M], the other is −[M]; in other words, the matrix is determined “uniquely up to
sign.” This apparently trivial fact turns out to have deep signiﬁcance in both mathematics
and physics; see Penrose and Rindler (1984, Ch. 1) and Penrose (2005, §11.3).
technical details—having to do with “spinorial objects,” that do not return to their original state after being rotated by 2π! For
an intuitive explanation of the existence of such seemingly impossible objects, see Penrose (2005, §11.3).

Chapter 6 Isometries and Complex Numbers
6.3
The Main Result
We can now state and prove a more detailed version of the Main Result, (6.2):
The symmetry groups G+(S) of all three geometries of constant curvature are
subgroups of the group of Möbius transformations.
1. Euclidean Geometry (K = 0):
E(z) = eiθz + k.
Note that z 7→z is an opposite isometry, being reﬂection in the real axis. Thus
(6.1) tells us that the full group of isometries G = {E(z)} ∪{E(z)}.
2. Spherical Geometry (K = +1) in the stereographic map:
S(z) =
az + b
−bz + a,
where
|a|2 + |b|2 = 1.
(6.10)
Note that z 7→z is an opposite isometry, being reﬂection of the sphere in the
vertical plane through the real axis. Thus (6.1) tells us that the full group of
isometries G = {S(z)} ∪{S(z)}.
3. Hyperbolic Geometry (K = −1) in the Beltrami–Poincaré half-plane map:
H(z) = az + b
cz + d ,
where a, b, c, d are real, and (ad −bc) = 1. (6.11)
Note that z 7→−z is an opposite isometry, being reﬂection in the imaginary
axis. Thus, again by (6.1), the full group of isometries G = {H(z)} ∪{H(−z)}.
The matrix results (6.8) and (6.9) make it a simple matter [exercise] to verify that each of these
three sets is indeed a group. We also note that in the spherical case the matrices are of a special
kind that plays an important role in physics. They are called unitary, meaning that if you take the
conjugate and then transpose (the net operation being denoted ∗) then [exercise] you obtain the
matrix of the inverse transformation:
unitary means
[S][S]∗= the identity matrix.
The Euclidean transformation E(z) is a rotation of θ followed by a translation of k, and it
seems clear that this indeed the most general rigid motion of the plane. We therefore rush past
this and reserve our energy for the challenge of proving the surprising results claimed for K = ±1.
In this work we cannot pause to do geometric justice to these lovely results; instead, we refer
you to VCA. For now, let us show off the computational power of the metric machinery we have
developed.
To do so, we need to pause and introduce a pinch of Complex Analysis. As we explained in
Section 4.6, the derivative f′(z) of a complex mapping z 7→w = f(z) is deﬁned exactly as in ﬁrst-
year calculus, and all the usual rules of differentiation apply without change. Thus, applying the
quotient rule to the normalized (i.e., (ad −bc) = 1) Möbius transformation, we ﬁnd that
M(z) = az + b
cz + d
=⇒
M′(z) =
1
(cz + d)2 .
(6.12)

6.3 The Main Result
•
73
But recall from (4.19) that the complex numbers imbue this derivative with the “amplitwist”
interpretation, which is magically richer than in ordinary calculus.
We can now return to the Main Result. As Euler was the ﬁrst to prove (in 1775) the rigid
motions of the sphere are simply rotations, and it was Gauss (around 1819) who ﬁrst recognized
that they could be represented as Möbius transformations of the form (6.10).
Taking the sphere to have unit radius, we may rewrite the stereographic metric formula (4.22)
in terms of the complex number z:
dbs =
2
1 + |z|2 |dz|.
To prove that the mapping z 7→w = S(z) =
az+b
−bz+a is a direct isometry, we must therefore show
that
2
1 + |w|2 |dw| =
2
1 + |z|2 |dz|.
(6.13)
Direct calculation shows [exercise] that
1 + |w|2 =
1 + |z|2
| −bz + a | 2 .
It follows from (6.12) that

dw
dz
 =
S′(z)
 =
1
| −bz + a | 2 = 1 + |w|2
1 + |z|2 ,
thereby conﬁrming (6.13), and with it part 2 of the Main Result. (Well, this does not prove that
these are the only direct isometries. This will be addressed by our deferred geometric analysis.)
But how could any mortal (even Gauss) have guessed the form of these Möbius transfor-
mations?! Here is a simple argument, based only on what we know so far: If the rotation carries
the point bz on the sphere to [
M(z), then it must also carry the point antipodal to bz to the point antipodal to
[
M(z). But we know that the stereographic images of antipodal points are related by (4.27), page 49,
and so
M


M(z)

Thus,

az + b
=⇒
−b z + a
d z −c = c z + d
a z + b,
which is clearly satisﬁed if c = −b and d = a, which is precisely the form of (6.10)!
In Exercise 27 we give concrete examples of how to represent rotations as Möbius trans-
formations, and we also provide a constructive proof that every rotation must be a Möbius
transformation of the form (6.10).
Lastly, consider the hyperbolic plane. The metric formula (5.7) tells us that we must show that
z 7→w = H(z) = az+b
cz+d satisﬁes
|dw|
Im w = |dz|
Im z.
(6.14)
Direct calculation shows [exercise, recalling that a = a, . . .] that
Im w = w −w
2i
=
Im z
|cz + d|2 .

thereby conﬁrming (6.14), and with it the ﬁnal part of the Main Result.
These hyperbolic isometries not only contain analogues of ordinary rotations and transla-
tions, but they also include a third type of rigid motion, called a limit rotation, which has no
counterpart in ordinary Euclidean Geometry. It is the limit of an ordinary rotation of H2 as the
centre of rotation moves off to inﬁnity, ultimately becoming a point on the horizon, y = 0. For
details, see VCA, pp. 306–313.
6.4
Einstein’s Spacetime Geometry
If mere subgroups of the group of Möbius transformations have such deep signiﬁcance for geo-
metry, it is natural to ask if even more remarkable powers reside within the full group that gave
rise to them.
Indeed, the full group plays a fundamental role in at least two seemingly unrelated spheres
of knowledge: Relativity Theory and 3-dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry. In fact this is not a coin-
cidence. There is a deep connection between these two subjects, but we shall not be able to explore
it here, and instead direct you to the wonderful exposition of Penrose (2005, §18.4).
The ﬁrst role may be called “fundamental” without hyperbole:8
The Möbius group describes the symmetries of space and time, or, more precisely,
of Einstein’s uniﬁcation of the two—spacetime.
Clearly it would be neither appropriate nor feasible for us to explore Einstein’s Special Theory
of Relativity in detail here.9 However, for readers who have not studied this theory previously, we
shall try to say enough to make sense of this particular connection with the Möbius group.10
The starting point of Einstein’s theory is an extraordinary and bizarre experimental fact of
Nature:
The speed of light is the same for all observers in uniform relative motion.
As Einstein ﬁrst recognized in 1905, this can only be possible if such observers disagree about
measurements of space and time!
To quantify this, let us combine the time T and the 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates
(X, Y, Z) of an event E into a single 4-vector (T, X, Y, Z) in 4-dimensional spacetime.11 These are
the space and time coordinates of event E for what we shall call our ﬁrst observer.
Of course the spatial components of the ﬁrst observer’s vector have no absolute signiﬁcance:
if a second observer uses the same origin but has coordinate axes rotated relative to the ﬁrst, then
8We encourage you not to peek, but, the mathematically precise statement of this result will be given in (6.20).
9For a wonderfully physical account of the theory, we recommend Taylor and Wheeler (1992). For more on the geometry of the
theory, we strongly recommend Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) and Penrose (2005).
10According to Coxeter (1967, pp. 73–77), this connection was ﬁrst recognized by H. Liebmann almost immediately, in 1905!
11In fact it was Hermann Minkowski who in 1908 recast Einstein’s 1905 theory in these geometrical terms, and at ﬁrst Einstein
himself did not approve!

6.4 Einstein’s Spacetime Geometry
•
75
this second observer will ascribe different spatial coordinates (eX, eY, eZ) to the same event E. Yet,
if these two observers are not in relative motion, they will nevertheless agree on the value of
eX2 + eY2 + eZ2 = X2 + Y2 + Z2, for this represents the square of the distance to the point where the
event happened.
In contrast to this, we are accustomed to thinking that the time component T does have an
absolute signiﬁcance. However, Einstein’s theory—conﬁrmed by innumerable experiments—tells
us that this is wrong. If our two (momentarily coincident) observers are in relative motion, they will
disagree about the times at which events occur. Furthermore, they will no longer agree about the value
of (X2 + Y2 + Z2)—this is the famous Lorentz contraction.
Such effects are only discernible if the relative speed of the two observers is a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the fantastic speed of light (which is roughly 186,000 miles per second). For example, even
if the second observer shoots away from the ﬁrst observer with the speed of a riﬂe bullet (2,000
miles per hour), then even over the period of their entire adult lifetimes (say 85 years), the total
accumulated discrepancy between their two clocks would only amount to about one hundredth
of a second! It is this accident of our snail-like existence relative to the speed of light that hid for
thousands of years (and continues to hide, day-to-day) the truth of Einstein’s discovery.
But if the second object is travelling at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light, the
temporal and spatial distortion is dramatic, and this effect is witnessed daily in particle accel-
erators around the world. Under these strange circumstances, is there any aspect of spacetime
that has absolute signiﬁcance and upon which the two observers in uniform relative motion must
agree?
Einstein’s amazing answer is “Yes!”: spacetime does possess an absolute structure that is inde-
pendent of all observers. For this reason, Einstein personally disliked, and resisted for years, the
name “Theory of Relativity”—it should be “Theory of the Absolute”!
Making a convenient choice of units in which the speed of light is equal to 1, Einstein12 dis-
covered that both observers will agree on the value of the spacetime intervalגbetween the the
observer and the event. This interval13גis deﬁned by means of its square:
ג2 ≡T2 −(X2 + Y2 + Z2) = eT2 −(eX2 + eY2 + eZ2).
(6.15)
As Minkowski realized, this is the correct generalization of the concept of distance appropriate
to spacetime, and the isometries/symmetries of spacetime must preserve it. But, quite unlike
ordinary distance, here the square of the interval between distinct events can be zero or even negative.
Let us provide a more vivid interpretation ofגin the case14ג2 > 0. As we have said, we sup-
pose our two observers (in uniform relative motions to one another) are momentarily coincident
at one particular place and time, deﬁning an origin event that we label O. (Of course for this event
to be precisely deﬁned we must imagine our observers to be pointlike, having a speciﬁc location.)
Now suppose that (by accident or by design) the ﬁrst observer arrives at the event E just as it
happens. As far as she is concerned, she has been sitting still the whole time, and both events O
and E happened right where she sits (X = Y = Z = 0), and therefore the spacetime interval between
O and E (upon which all observers must agree) is simply= גT:
12Just as we have previously asked Poincaré to step aside slightly, to make room for Beltrami in connection with H2, so now
must we ask Einstein to step aside slightly for Poincaré: already in 1905 Poincaré, too, had discovered the invariance of the
spacetime interval. Of course Hendrik Lorentz should be considered the third father of Special Relativity, but at least he is
immortalized in the group of transformations that bear his name.
13Surprisingly, there is no standard symbol for this interval, but our use of gimel (the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet)
seems appropriate: it resembles (visually) the English “I” of “Interval,” and one connotation (culturally) of gimel is of a bridge
connecting two points.
14Ifג2 < 0 there is a different but equally simple interpretation; see Taylor and Wheeler (1992, Ch. 1).

76
•
Chapter 6 Isometries and Complex Numbers
If an observer in uniform motion carries a wristwatch from one event to another,
the invariant spacetime intervalגbetween the two events is simply the elapsed
time on that watch.
(6.16)
Next, imagine that a spark occurs at the event O, so that photons (particles of light) travel
out in all directions from this ﬂash. If both observers focus their attention on a single photon, both
will agree that every event along this photon’s spacetime trajectory has= ג0. Such a 4-vector of
vanishing “length,” pointing along a particular light ray, is called a null vector.
A Lorentz transformation L is a linear transformation of spacetime (a 4 × 4 matrix) that maps
one observer’s description (T, X, Y, Z) of an event to another observer’s description (eT, eX, eY, eZ) of
the same event. Put differently, L is a linear transformation that preserves the quantityג2, upon
which both observers must agree.
Now let’s return to the imagined ﬂash of light—an origin-centred sphere whose radius
increases at the speed of light. After time T = 1 these photons will form a sphere of unit radius,
which we now choose to identify with the Riemann sphere. Thus this sphere is now thought of
as made up of points that are simultaneously labelled with spacetime coordinates (1, X, Y, Z) and
with complex numbers, assigned stereographically via (4.25) on page 48.
Substituting the projective-coordinate description z = (z1/z2) into the stereographic formulas
(4.25), we obtain,
X = z1 z2 + z2 z1
|z1|2 + |z2|2 ,
Y =
z1 z2 −z2 z1
i (|z1|2 + |z2|2),
and
Z = |z1|2 −|z2|2
|z1|2 + |z2|2 .
But a light ray may be identiﬁed by any null vector along it, so instead of choosing T = 1 let
us now eliminate the denominators in the above expressions by scaling up our null vector by a
factor of (|z1|2 + |z2|2) (i.e., by choosing T = |z1|2 + |z2|2). The new null vector (T, X, Y, Z) (in the same
spacetime direction as the original) is therefore given by
T = |z1|2 + |z2|2,
X = z1 z2 + z2 z1,
Y = −i (z1 z2 −z2 z1),
Z = |z1|2 −|z2|2.
.
You may readily check [exercise] that these formulas may be inverted to yield
 
T + Z

matrix:

T + Z
X + iY
X −iY

.
(6.18)
This makes it easy to see [exercise] that this scaled-up spacetime vector is still null, as it should be.

6.4 Einstein’s Spacetime Geometry

Having now used stereographic projection to identify light rays with complex numbers,15 via
(6.17), let us ﬁnd the effect on the ﬂash of light effected by a Möbius16 transformation z 7→ez = M(z)
of C, or equivalently,
"

[M]∗.
(6.19)
Finally, imagine that this linear transformation is applied to all spacetime vectors (not just null
ones). Because det[M] = 1 = det[M]∗, it follows from (6.18) that this linear transformation preserves
the spacetime interval:
eג2 = det
{

Thus,
Every Möbius transformation of C yields a unique Lorentz transformation of
spacetime. Conversely, it can be shown (Penrose and Rindler, 1984, Ch. 1) that
to every Lorentz transformation there corresponds a unique (up to sign) Möbius
transformation.
(6.20)
Even amongst professional physicists, this beautiful “miracle” is not as well known as it should be.
It turns out that every Möbius or Lorentz transformation is fundamentally equivalent to one
of just four archetypes. The essential idea is to focus on the so-called ﬁxed points of the trans-
formation, meaning points that remain ﬁxed in the sense that they are mapped to themselves:
M(z) = z.
Clearly [exercise] this leads to a quadratic equation with two solutions that may be distinct or
coincide. If the ﬁxed points are distinct, one can imagine17 them to be the north and south poles;
this yields the three archetypes shown in [6.5a–c]. If the two ﬁxed points coincide, one can imagine
them both to be the north pole; this yields the fourth archetype shown in [6.5d].
To make these four types of Lorentz transformation more vivid, imagine yourself in a space-
ship in interstellar space, looking out in all directions at countless stars scattered over your
celestial sphere. This is an imagined unit sphere with you at its centre, a dot being marked on
its surface wherever the starlight intercepts the sphere on its way to your eye. We suppose the
sphere to be aligned with your spaceship, the north pole lying directly ahead of you.
15Exercise 33 explains Penrose’s method of accomplishing this directly in spacetime.
16In the context of relativity theory, a Möbius transformation is called a spin transformation, and the corresponding matrix
[M] is called a spin matrix. See Penrose and Rindler (1984, Ch. 1) for details.
17For a detailed justiﬁcation of this simpliﬁcation in the case of Möbius transformations, see VCA, Ch. 3; in the case of Lorentz
transformation, see Penrose and Rindler (1984, Ch. 1).

[6.5] Classiﬁcation of Möbius and Lorentz Transformations. Each of the four types of transformation has
two names, depending on whether it is viewed as acting on C (name on the left) or on spacetime (name on
the right).
If you now ﬁre your lateral thrusters so as to set your spaceship in a spin about its north–south
axis, then the star ﬁeld will rotate around you, as illustrated in [6.5a]. Unsurprisingly, this type
of Lorentz transformation is called a rotation. In the complex plane the corresponding Möbius
transformation is also a rotation, M(z) = eiαz, and this type is called elliptic.
Suppose you are no longer spinning and that you now ﬁre your powerful main engines.
Almost instantly this sends your craft hurtling at nearly light speed v directly ahead toward the
north pole of your celestial sphere. As illustrated in [6.5b], you will in fact see the stars crowd
toward your direction of travel—the exact opposite of the depiction in most science-ﬁction ﬁlms!
This type of Lorentz transformation is called a boost. In the complex plane the corresponding
Möbius transformation is a simple expansion by some real factor ρ, M(z) = ρz, and this type is
called hyperbolic. In fact (see Ex. 34) the expansion factor ρ is related to the spacecraft velocity v by
ρ =
r
1 + v
1 −v.
(6.21)
If you ﬁre your main engines and your lateral thrusters then the previous two effects combine
to cause the star ﬁeld to spiral toward your direction of motion, as shown in [6.5c]. This type
of Lorentz transformation is called a four-screw, and the corresponding Möbius transformation,
M(z) = ρeiαz, is called loxodromic.

6.5 Three-Dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry
•
79
The last type of Lorentz transformation is shown in [6.5d]. It is called a null rotation and
both of its ﬁxed points are coincident at the north pole. While it is hard to give a vivid physical
description of this spacetime transformation, the corresponding Möbius transformation is called
parabolic and is a simple translation of C: M(z) = z + τ. This moves every complex number along
a line parallel to τ. But, as we know from [4.8], page 45, these lines all stereographically project to
circles through the north pole with a common tangent there that is parallel to τ, thereby explaining
the form of [6.5d]. Note that movements on the sphere become smaller and smaller as the north
pole is approached, leaving this as the only ﬁxed point.
6.5
Three-Dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry
Remarkably, neither Lobachevsky nor Bolyai set out to develop a 2-dimensional non-Euclidean
Geometry. Instead, from the outset, both men independently sought a hyperbolic alterna-
tive to three-dimensional18 Euclidean space; hyperbolic planes then emerged naturally within
this hyperbolic 3-space.
Recall that we created a conformal map of the hyperbolic plane in the upper-half-plane by
taking the metric to be
dbs =
ds
Euclidean height above the boundary =
p
dx2 + dy2
y
.
(6.22)
To generalize this to a three-dimensional hyperbolic space, H3, consider the half-space Z > 0 above
the horizontal (X, Y)-plane of Euclidean 3-space (X, Y, Z). We may now create a conformal model
of H3 by again taking the metric to be19
dbs =
ds
Euclidean height above the boundary =
p
dX2 + dY2 + dZ2
Z
.
(6.23)
Points on the (X, Y)-plane (Z = 0) are therefore inﬁnitely far away, and this bounding plane is the
two-dimensional horizon, which we will now think of as the complex plane C, with coordinates
X + iY.
It follows immediately from this construction that every vertical half-plane is a copy of H2.
See [6.6] and compare to [5.5]. (By extension, imagine this space ﬁlled with small spheres of equal
hyperbolic size, shrinking in apparent Euclidean size as the horizon is approached.)
If we imagine light travelling within such a vertical plane, symmetry dictates that it remain in
that plane, and our previous analysis of the path taken by the light therefore applies. Thus,
The geodesics of H3 are the vertical half-lines and the semicircles orthogonal to
the horizon, C.
In H2 the vertical half-lines are exceptional geodesics, the typical ones being the semicircles
orthogonal to the horizon. Likewise, in H3 the vertical half-planes are the exceptional hyperbolic
planes; the typical planes are in fact hemispheres orthogonal to the horizon C, such as the one
shown in [6.6].

[6.6] Hyperbolic 3-Space, H3. Hyperbolic planes appear as vertical half-planes and hemispheres orthogonal to
C. The intersection of two such planes is a hyperbolic line: a vertical half-line, or a semicircle orthogonal to C.
To begin to see this, imagine that you live in H3; what would you mean by the word “plane”?
Suppose I hand you an inﬁnitesimal disc D centred at p. To extend this disc (uniquely) into an
inﬁnite “plane” H, you presumably need to prolong its diameters into inﬁnite hyperbolic lines,
i.e., semicircles meeting C orthogonally. If the disc is vertical this clearly yields the vertical half-
plane containing D. If the disc D is not vertical, we claim that the construction will instead generate
a hemisphere H orthogonal to C, with D coincident with the tangent plane to H at p. Incidentally,
we may easily construct the centre of this hemisphere as the intersection with C of the (Euclidean)
normal to D through p.
In [6.6] let us take the illustrated hemisphere to be this H. Consider the illustrated intersection
of H with a vertical plane through p. Clearly this is a hyperbolic line extending a diameter of D,
since we have constructed H to have its tangent plane coincident with D at p. Now let L be the
illustrated vertical line through p. If we rotate the vertical plane about L, this hyperbolic line of
intersection sweeps out all of H, so this is indeed the unique extension of D into a plane. Thus,
The hyperbolic planes of H3 are the vertical half-planes and the hemispheres
orthogonal to the horizon, C.
It is clear that a vertical half-plane is a hyperbolic plane in two senses: it is what an inhabitant
of H3 calls a plane, and its internal geometry is that of H2. Is the same true of the hemispherical
planes? That is, if we measure distance within such a hemisphere using the hyperbolic metric
(6.23) of the ambient space H3, do we obtain an H2?
The answer is “Yes”: each hemisphere is intrinsically an H2. Indeed if you live in H3 then
every direction is like every other direction, every line is like every other line, and every plane is

6.5 Three-Dimensional Hyperbolic Geometry

like every other plane. By generalizing geometric inversion to 3-dimensional space, it is possible to
provide a natural geometric explanation, by showing that there exist motions that carry a vertical
hyperbolic plane into a hemispherical one, so their intrinsic geometries must be the same.20 For
now, though, we shall make do with a calculation.
If we use spherical polar coordinates (longitude and latitude) on the hemisphere of radius R,
then Z = R cos ϕ, so (4.4) implies that the hyperbolic metric (6.23) reduces to
dbs2 = sin2 ϕ dθ2 + dϕ2
cos2 ϕ
.
(6.24)
To see that this really is H2, we can either introduce new coordinates that transform this metric
into the standard form (6.22) (see Ex. 28) or else we can use the intrinsic metric curvature formula
(4.10) to conﬁrm [exercise] that K = −1.
Let us describe a couple of simple isometries of H3. The metric (6.23) is clearly unaltered by
a horizontal Euclidean translation,
X + iY 7−→X + iY + (complex constant)
and
Z 7→Z.
Likewise, hyperbolic distance is unaltered by an origin-centred Euclidean dilation (expansion) of
space,
(X, Y, Z) 7−→k(X, Y, Z) = (kX, kY, kZ),
where k > 0 is the expansion factor, for this will scale up both ds and Z by the same factor k,
leaving dbs unchanged.
Combining this with the translations, we see that any dilation centred on the horizon is also
an isometry. The existence of these two kinds of isometries again conﬁrms that all hemispherical
planes must have the same intrinsic geometry, because any one of them can be rigidly moved to
any other: translate the ﬁrst so that its centre coincides with the centre of the second, then expand
it till the radii are equal.
Any isometry must carry planes to planes, which means that their boundary circles in C must
also be carried to other circles. It turns out (though we shall not be able to prove it here) that this
circle-preserving property is so special that it alone sufﬁces to completely determine21 the complex
mappings involved: they can only be Möbius transformations!
Conversely, any Möbius transformation of C induces a unique transformation of all H3, because a
point p in H3 is uniquely determined as the intersection of three planes, which can be encoded as
the three circles in which these hemispheres meet C. The images of these three circles then deter-
mine three new hemispheres, meeting in the image of p. Furthermore, it can be shown22 that this
induced transformation is automatically a direct isometry of H3. To summarize this wonderful
discovery of Poincaré (1883),
The group of direct isometries of hyperbolic 3-space, H3, is the Möbius group of
transformations of C.
If you grew up in this H3-world, and attended H3-school, you would learn that angles in
triangles always add up to less than two right angles, that there are inﬁnitely many lines parallel
20For details, see VCA, pp. 133–136, 322–327
21This remarkable fact was proved, in its most general form, by Carathéodory (1937).
22To see how Poincaré made this discovery, see Stillwell (1996, pp. 113–122). For more on the geometry underlying the result,

to a given line, etc. But at university you might eventually learn of a theoretical geometry that
deﬁes all your everyday experience: the angles in a triangle sum to exactly π, no matter how large
the triangle! In an attempt to make intuitive sense of such bizarre phenomena, mathematicians
seek to construct a model surface on which this “Euclidean” geometry actually holds true. And,
remarkably, they succeed!
Returning from parable to reality, it was actually Wachter (a student of Gauss) who ﬁrst dis-
covered such a surface in 1816, called a horosphere, later so named by Lobachevsky, who (along
with Bolyai) independently rediscovered it. In terms of [6.6], a typical horosphere is an ordinary
Euclidean sphere that rests on (touches) the horizon. Very surprisingly, if we measure distance
using the hyperbolic metric (6.23), geometry within the horosphere does indeed turn out to be
that of a ﬂat Euclidean plane! See Exercises 30 and 32.
Beltrami provided a simpler way of seeing this. Using the same three-dimensional general-
ization of geometric inversion that allows us to swap the vertical half-planes and the hemispheres,
he observed that a typical horosphere can be moved so that it becomes Z = const. = k. Within this
horizontal surface, the hyperbolic metric (6.23) then reduces to
dbs =
p
dX2 + dY2
k
,
which is clearly Euclidean.
Recall that Hilbert proved that one cannot construct a full hyperbolic plane in Euclidean
space. The existence of horospheres (full Euclidean planes) in hyperbolic space is therefore our ﬁrst
intimation of Hyperbolic Geometry’s superiority, Euclidean Geometry becoming subordinate to it.
In fact Spherical Geometry is subsumed as well. For it turns out that what an inhabitant of H3 calls
a sphere (i.e., the set of points at ﬁxed hyperbolic distance from the centre) actually appears in our
model as a Euclidean sphere, but with a different centre. Furthermore, such a hyperbolic sphere
has intrinsic geometry of constant positive curvature: it’s as spherical as it looks! See Exercise 31.
We have repeatedly entertained the notion of intelligent creatures living in a non-Euclidean
world such as H3; this is less fanciful than you might suppose. In 1915 Einstein discovered that the
actual spacetime that we inhabit is not ﬂat! In fact energy and matter warp the fabric of spacetime,
producing a complicated pattern of curvature, both positive and negative, varying from place to
place, time to time, and direction to direction.23
Under normal circumstance, however, the amount of curvature is so fantastically small that
angle sums of triangles differ from π by an utterly undetectable amount, creating the illusion
that our world obeys the laws of Euclidean Geometry. This illusion is so perfect and so compelling
that it held sway for 4000 years.
Nevertheless, the subtle pattern of spacetime curvature that Einstein discovered in 1915 is
extremely important, even in everyday life, and it has a name . . . it is called gravity!
23Einstein’s supremely beautiful theory is called General Relativity, and it is the subject of Chapter 30.

Given the metric of a general surface in general

This equation is elliptic, and the general theory of elliptic partial differential equations

equator, as shown in the ﬁgure below. We now draw a map of the sphere by projecting its

der, as shown. This is the Archimedes–Lambert projection, ﬁrst investigated by Archimedes

(c. 250 BCE), then rediscovered and published by Lambert about 2000 years later, in 1772. Lam-
bert’s seminal treatise was the ﬁrst systematic mathematical investigation of maps, based on
which properties they preserved.
(i) Show (ideally geometrically) that the metric of the sphere now takes the form
dbs2 = (R2 −y2) dx2 +
dy2
R2 −y2 .
(ii) Apply the curvature formula (4.10) to conﬁrm that K = +1/R2.
(iii) Use (4.12) to deduce that the projection preserves area. For example, the two illustrated
T-shapes have equal area. As Archimedes realized, this implies that the area of the entire
sphere must equal that or the original rectangle: (2πR)(2R) = 4πR2. Archimedes was so
proud of this (and related discoveries on volumes) that he asked his friends to have this
particular diagram inscribed on his tomb. Almost a century-and-a-half later, in 75 BCE,
Cicero sought and found the tomb, overgrown with bushes, but with the cylinder and
sphere still visible.
(iv) Use the previous part to deduce (without integration) that the area A of the polar cap
0 ⩽ϕ ⩽Φ is
A = 2π R2(1 −cos Φ).
11. Central Cylindrical Projection. Reconsider the sphere and cylinder in the diagram of the pre-
vious question, but now imagine that the cylinder extends inﬁnitely upward and downward.
We again project the sphere onto the cylinder, but this time by imagining a point source of
light at the centre of the sphere, casting shadows onto the cylinder. This is called central
cylindrical projection.
(i) Sketch the projection and deduce that y = R cot ϕ.
(ii) Either using part (i), or directly geometrically, show that the metric now takes the form

(iii) Apply the curvature formula (4.10) to conﬁrm that K = +1/R2.
12. Mercator Projection. The projections of the sphere onto the cylinder in the the previous two
exercises share two properties: 1) meridians (θ = const.) are mapped to vertical generators
of the cylinder with the same θ; 2) circles of latitude (ϕ = const.) are mapped to horizontal
circular cross sections of the cylinder. In 1569 Gerardus Mercator discovered a third projec-
tion that shared these properties but that enjoyed the crucial advantage over the other two of
being conformal.
(i) Argue geometrically that if δbs is a small movement along a circle of latitude on the sphere
then the two required properties above imply that δbs ≍sin ϕ δs, where δs = δx is the
horizontal movement on the cylinder.
(ii) For our map to be conformal we must insist that we have the same scale factor for
inﬁnitesimal movements in all directions. In particular, suppose δbs is instead chosen
along a meridian, and let y = f(ϕ) be the height on the cylinder of the image of (θ, ϕ)
on the sphere. Deduce that
f′(ϕ) =
R
sin ϕ.

(Note: Neither logarithms nor calculus were known in Mercator’s time, so how did he do

(iv) If you ﬂy a plane or sail a ship on a ﬁxed compass heading, you travel along a loxodrome
(illustrated in [6.5c]), also called a rhumb line. If you unroll the cylinder onto a tabletop
to obtain a standard ﬂat Mercator navigational chart, how does your loxodromic route
appear in the chart? (Hint: No calculation required: just use conformality!)
13. An Impossibly Good Map. In the last few exercises we have met a map of the sphere that
preserves area, and another that preserves angles. Can we have a map that preserves both?
Show that no such map can exist for any curved surface, not just the sphere.

14. Pólya’s Mechanical Proof of Snell’s Law. Pólya (1954, pp. 149–152) provided the following
ingenious mechanical explanation of Snell’s Law, and hence yet another way for us to think
about the geodesics of the hyperbolic plane. The ﬁgure below is a modiﬁed form of [5.6],
in which the boundary between air and water is replaced by a frictionless rod, along which
slides a ring, p. Attached to this ring are two strings of ﬁxed length. As illustrated, each
string passes over a frictionless peg at ai and is attached to a mass mi that hangs a distance

16. Tractrix Parameterization. In (X, Y, Z)-space let us switch to cylindrical polar coordinates,
i.e., ordinary (r, θ) polar coordinates in the (X, Y)-plane, supplemented by Z. The Euclidean
metric in this space is therefore
ds2 = dr2 + r2dθ2 + dZ2.
In the plane θ = 0, i.e., the (X, Z)-plane, consider the curve traced by a particle whose position
at time t is
X = r = sech t,
Z = t −tanh t.
(i) Show that this curve is the tractrix: the distance along the tangent to the Z-axis is ﬁxed.
What is this ﬁxed distance? (Note: some interesting history and beautiful geometry
underlies this particular representation of the tractrix; see Stillwell (2010, pp. 341–342).)

placing staples along three of the edges. Use a pair of compasses (or inverted plate or bowl)

sheets in the centre of the circle. With heavy scissors, cut along the circle to obtain ten identical
discs, say of radius R. Repeat this whole process to double the number of discs to 20.
(i) Cut a narrow sector out of the ﬁrst disc, and tape the edges together to form a shallow
cone. Repeat this process with the remaining discs, steadily increasing the angle of the
sector each time, so that the cones get sharper and taller. (You may ﬁnd it easier to cut a
radial slit and overlap the paper before taping it together.) Ensure that by the end of the
process you are making very narrow cones, using only a quarter disc or less.

two pseudospheres stuck together at their narrow necks.

nating from w (in the disc). By deﬁnition, the hyperbolic length dbs of dw is the hyperbolic

native method of passing from a light ray to the associated complex number directly. Let the
point p be one unit vertically above the origin of the (horizontal) complex plane. Now imag-
ine that, simultaneously, p emits a ﬂash, and C begins to travel straight up (in the direction
ϕ = 0) at the speed of light (= 1) towards p. (You may imagine that the whole of C ﬂashed,
creating a plane wave.) Decompose the velocity of the photon F emitted by p in the direction
(θ, ϕ) into components perpendicular and parallel to C. Hence ﬁnd the time at which F hits
C. Deduce that F hits C at the point z = cot(ϕ/2) eiθ. Thus, Penrose’s construction is equivalent
to stereographic projection!

Chapter 8
Curvature of Plane Curves
8.1
Introduction
The study of curvature did not begin with surfaces. Rather, as the very name suggests, curvature
was born out of the study of curves, speciﬁcally, curves in the plane.
We certainly have an intuitive idea of a plane curve being straighter in one part and more
curved in another, but how can we quantify this degree of curving with mathematical precision?
Throughout the ﬁrst Act we focussed on the concept of intrinsic (Gaussian) curvature. And
at the close of Act I we provided another compelling justiﬁcation for this obsession with intrinsic
(versus extrinsic) geometry: it is the only kind of geometry of spacetime that is meaningful to us as
inhabitants of spacetime, and spacetime’s intrinsic curvature has a fundamental importance—it is
gravity.
But whereas a patch of given 2-dimensional surface could only be deformed in very limited
ways while preserving its intrinsic geometry (i.e., without stretching distances within it) the same
is not true of a 1-dimensional curve: we can bend it (without stretching it) so as to take up the form
of any other curve of the same length. Thus the very concept of 1-dimensional intrinsic curvature
simply cannot exist! Put differently, if you were a very short 1-dimensional being living within a
curve, only able to measure distance back and forth along the curve as you moved along it, the
shape of your curve would not merely be unknowable to you, it would be meaningless.
Thus, from the outset, it is clear that the best we can hope for is an extrinsic deﬁnition of
curvature: how the curve sits within the plane. The big surprise—“miracle” would be a better
word—is that this extrinsic concept of 1-dimensional curvature will ultimately be seen to have a
direct bearing on the intrinsic curvature of 2-dimensional surfaces.
As we have said, a 1-dimensional being within a curve cannot sense the curvature of his
world by measurements within it. But suppose we relax our notion of what is measurable and
knowable for such a being. Instead of only permitting measurements of length along the curve,
suppose we admit physical concepts such as mass, velocity, and force. For now, let us continue to
restrict ourselves to a plane curve. Picture this plane curve as a frictionless wire located in outer
space, with no gravitational (or other) forces at work, and suppose we launch a frictionless bead
of unit mass at unit speed along the wire.1
By virtue of the absence of external forces, the bead will continue to travel at unit speed
throughout its journey along the wire. But Newton’s First Law of Motion tells us that if no forces
acted on the bead, it would simply travel in a straight line. What is happening here is that as the
bead attempts to ﬂy in this straight line, the wire presses on it, at right angles to the direction of
motion, rotating the velocity vector so as to make it continue pointing along the wire, but without
changing the length of the velocity, which is the speed.
The more tightly curved a section of wire, the quicker the velocity vector must turn as it
passes through it. Newton’s Second Law of Motion tells us that this rate of change of the velocity
vector (acceleration) is in fact equal (for a unit mass) to the force F the curved wire exerts on the
1Of course while this still essentially concerns a 1-dimensional curve in a 2-dimensional plane, we are now viewing all this as
embedded in our physical 3-dimensional world. Indeed, we need at least three dimensions for the bead to encircle and cling
to the wire.

bead. The sharper a bend in the wire, the greater the force the wire must exert to make the bead’s
trajectory bend.
To make this idea more visceral, recall what it’s like to travel at high (constant) speed on
a ride along curved track at an amusement park or fairground. You have become effectively a
1-dimensional being, carried along the path of the ride. (We will come to curves that twist through
3-space soon, but, for now, imagine you are travelling along a horizontal (therefore planar) stretch
of track.) Even with your eyes shut, you can still feel the force as you go round a bend, the sides of
the car pressing against your body: the more tightly curved the bend, the greater the force.
Newton was in fact the ﬁrst to introduce a purely geometric deﬁnition of curvature κ, which
we shall meet it in moment, and as a consequence of his deﬁnition and his laws of motion, he was
indeed able to deduce that
If a bead of unit mass is launched at unit speed along a wire in the form of a plane
curve, the curvature κ of that curve is the force F, directed perpendicularly to the
curve, exerted by the wire on the bead.
(8.1)
This connection between geometry and physics (between the geometric bending of an orbit
and the force required to hold the object in that orbit) became the linchpin of Newton’s magnum
opus, arguably the single most important scientiﬁc work in history, the great Principia of 1687.
In it, Newton used inﬁnitesimal geometry—the “ultimate equalities” described in the
Prologue—to explain the workings of the heavens, including the elliptical orbits of the planets
about the Sun as the primary focus. Only now the planets are not threaded onto wires, rather their
orbits are deﬂected from rectilinear motion by the invisible hand of gravity, reaching out across
space from the Sun, diminishing in strength in proportion to the square of the distance: Newton’s
famous Inverse-Square Law of Gravitation.
8.2
The Circle of Curvature
The Principia lay more than two decades in the future when (shortly before his Christmas Day
birthday2 in 1664) the 21-year-old Newton began to investigate what he called the “crookednesse”
of plane curves, thereby introducing the concept of curvature into mathematics for the ﬁrst time.
Newton identiﬁed the circle of curvature at a point p on a curve C as the circle that best
approximates the curve in the immediate vicinity of p, just as the tangent is the line that does this
best (see [8.1]).
He constructed the centre c (the centre of curvature) of this approximating circle as the lim-
iting position of the intersection of the normal at p with the normal at a neighbouring point q,
in the limit q →p. Then pc is called the radius of curvature, and κ ≡(1/pc) is what Newton ini-
tially dubbed the “crookednesse,” but later rechristened as the curvature. (IMPORTANT NOTE ON
NOTATION: Here “pc” denotes the distance between the points p and c.)
Next, following Newton, we measure κ by looking at how fast the curve departs from its own
tangent line (see [8.2]). By deﬁnition of the curvature κ at p, the illustrated diameter has length
ps = (2/κ). Now let q be a point on C near to p (where ξ = pq) and drop a perpendicular of length
qt = σ from q to the tangent T at p, and ﬁnally let ϵ = pt.
Since T is tangent to C, limϵ→0(σ/ϵ) = 0, and therefore

[8.1] The circle of curvature at p is the circle that best
approximates the curve there. The curvature κ is deﬁned to
be the reciprocal of its radius.
IMPORTANT NOTE ON NOTATION: Here,
and throughout the book, we shall
employ the ≍notation, representing
Newton’s concept of ultimate equal-
ity, as introduced and deﬁned in the
Prologue.
Also, the shaded triangle ptq is
ultimately similar to the triangle sqp,
so

This is essentially Newton’s Lem-
ma II, from Book I of the Principia
(Newton 1687 p. 439) (see also Brack-
enridge and Nauenberg (2002, p. 112)).
Depending on whether it is κ or σ
that needs to found in terms of the
other, we may combine the previous
two results to deduce that
κ ≍2σ
ϵ2
or
σ ≍1
2κϵ2.
(8.2)
It is convenient to attach a sign to the curvature: κ is positive if C is concave up, and negative if
it is concave down. For example, it follows immediately that the parabola with Cartesian equation
y = ax2 has curvature κ = 2a at the origin. Likewise, the Taylor expansion of cos x tells us [exercise]
that the graph y = cos x has κ = −1 at the point (0, 1), and the circle of curvature is therefore the
unit circle, centred at the origin.

8.3
Newton’s Curvature Formula
Suppose that the curve C is the graph y = f(x). If the x-axis is drawn parallel to the tangent
line T, then Taylor’s Theorem implies [exercise] that σ ≍(1/2)f′′(xp)ϵ2, where xp denotes the
x-coordinate of p. Thus (8.2) implies
κ = f′′(xp).
Note that this formula automatically complies with our convention regarding the sign of κ.
More generally, suppose that the x-axis is now drawn in an arbitrary direction, so that T is
inclined at angle φ to it, so that f′ = tan φ. In this general case, Newton discovered that the correct
generalization of the above formula is,
κ =
f′′
{
1 + [f′]2}3/2 .
(8.3)
Here it is understood that the derivatives are evaluated at x = xp.
Having now been exposed to several examples of the use of inﬁnitesimal geometry, you
should have little difﬁculty in following Newton’s original proof of his formula, which is repro-
duced in Knoebel (2007, pp. 182–185). Here, however, we shall provide a different geometric
argument that seeks to explain the complicated new denominator of (8.3) as a simple consequence
of rotating the x-axis. See [8.3].
As before, here ϵ ≡pt, and σ ≡qt, and we now suppose the x-axis to be drawn horizontally,
instead of along the tangent T. Taylor’s Theorem now says that if δx ≡xq −xp then the height of
q above T is given by aq ≍(1/2)f′′(δx)2. Because the two shaded triangles are evidently similar,
when aq is projected into the direction perpendicular to T, we pick up one factor of cos φ and
obtain σ ≍(1/2)f′′(δx)2 cos φ.
Next, pa ≍pt = ϵ, and therefore δx ≍ϵ cos φ. Thus in projecting from the tangent onto the
horizontal x-axis we pick up two additional factors of cos φ, yielding three in all:

[8.4] Curvature is the rate of turning of the tangent. If the unit tangent T turns through angle δφ in moving
distance δs along C, then κ ≍(δφ/δs). Vectorially, in the box on the right, the rate of change of the unit
tangent is (dT/ds) ≍(δT/δs) ≍(N δφ/δs) ≍κN.
Finally, the boxed subﬁgure on the right of [8.3] demonstrates that
cos φ =
1
√
1 + [f′]2 ,
and so Newton’s formula (8.3) now follows immediately from (8.2).
8.4
Curvature as Rate of Turning
In 1761, about a century after Newton had introduced the concept of curvature, Kaestner pub-
lished a simple alternative interpretation that would ultimately prove to be more amenable to
generalization than Newton’s.
Curvature is the rate of turning of the tangent with respect to arc length. In other
words, if φ is the angle of the tangent, and s is arc length, then κ = (dφ/ds).
(8.4)
Note that this has the immediate advantage of being determined by local measurements con-
ducted in the immediate vicinity of a tiny piece of curve: we no longer need to draw normals and
follow them off into the distance until they intersect at the centre of curvature.
To conﬁrm that (8.4) is equivalent to Newton’s deﬁnition, it sufﬁces to verify this for a perfect
circle of radius ρ and curvature κ = (1/ρ), for this circle may then be taken to be the circle of
curvature in the general case. Since the rate of turning is clearly uniform in the case of a circle,
consider one complete revolution: the tangent rotates 2π while traversing the full circumference
of 2πρ, and therefore the rate of turning is (2π)/(2πρ) = κ, as was to be shown.
Fig. [8.4] reproves this equivalence, and also takes us a step further. Here T denotes the unit
tangent vector to C, and N denotes the unit normal, pointing toward the centre of curvature, c.
As we move a small distance δs from p to q, T rotates by δφ. Since δs is ultimately equal to the
corresponding segment of the circle of curvature of radius (1/κ) (according to Newton’s original
deﬁnition), δs ≍(1/κ)δφ. Therefore κ = (dφ/ds), reconﬁrming (8.4).

•
Chapter 8 Curvature of Plane Curves
But now, in addition, the subﬁgure on the right of [8.4] allows us to determine the change δT ≡
(Tq −Tp) in the vector T itself as we pass from p to q. By drawing both unit tangents emanating
from the same point, we may visualize δT as the illustrated vector connecting their tips, which
will ultimately point along N. But the length of this vector is ultimately equal to the arc of the unit
circle (shown dotted) connecting these tips, so δT ≍N δφ. Thus,

[8.5] As T and N rotate together, their tips begin to move along
N and −T, respectively, and by equal amounts.
We can now return to our open-
ing discussion of curvature in terms
of a bead of unit mass travelling at
unit speed along the curve C. Because
it travels at unit speed, the veloc-
ity vector v of the bead is simply T,
and also δs = δt. Therefore in (8.5)
(dT/ds) = (dv/dt) is in fact the accel-
eration of the bead, which in turn
is the force exerted by the wire.
We have thus conﬁrmed the original
claim (8.1).
Of course we may just as easily
think of curvature as the rate of turn-
ing of the normal N, instead of the
tangent. Indeed [8.5] shows simply
and vividly that just as the tip of T begins to rotate in the direction of N, so the tip of N begins to
rotate in the direction of −T, and by an equal amount, so
dN
ds = −κ T.
Indeed, this use of the normal in place of the tangent will prove to be of crucial importance when
we redirect our attention from curves back to surfaces, for in the latter case there is no such thing
as “the” tangent, but there is still a unique normal vector, perpendicular to the tangent plane of
the surface. How this normal vector varies in the immediate vicinity of a point on the surface will
indeed tell us the Gaussian curvature at that point.
(As an aside, we note once again the distinction between geometric understanding and blind
calculation, which is trivially simple in the case above. Let φ denote the angle that the tangent
makes with the horizontal x-axis, so that
T =
[
cos φ
sin φ
]
and
N =
[
−sin φ
cos φ
]
.
Let a prime denote differentiation with respect to arc length, so that κ = φ′. Then calculation
immediately yields T′ = φ′ N and N′ = −φ′ T.)
What if the bead is instead travelling at an arbitrary (but constant) speed v and has arbi-
trary mass m? In that case, by deﬁnition, δs ≍v δt, and v = vT. Thus (8.5) becomes the following
generalized version of the famous result for the force needed to hold an object in a circular orbit:
F = mdv
dt = κmv2 N.

are drawn emanating from the same point, so the vector connecting their tips is δv ≍.v δt. Looking at the area
of the triangle in two different ways yields formula (8.6) for κ.
Newton ﬁrst began to glimpse this as early as 1665,3 as he struggled to understand the force that
held the moon in its orbit.
This new interpretation of curvature (as rate of turning) allows us to deal with curves that
cannot be expressed as the graph of a function, and which are therefore beyond the reach of New-
ton’s original formula (8.3). Let C be the orbit of a particle whose position at time t is (x[t], y[t]), so
that the velocity is
v =
[ .x.y
]
,
and therefore
tan φ = .y.x
,
where, following Newton, the dot4 denotes differentiation with respect to time. Note that we are
no longer assuming that the speed is constant: the length of v may vary.
By differentiating both sides of the previous equation, tan φ = (.y/.x), and using the chain rule,
it is not hard to obtain [exercise] a more general formula (also discovered by Newton):
κ = .x..y −.y..x
[.x
2 +.y
2]3/2 .
(8.6)
However, let us try to understand this formula in more direct, geometric terms. See [8.6a],
which shows the velocity v at p and the velocity a moment δt later, after which the particle has
travelled δs ≍v δt along C. In [8.6b], both velocity vectors have been drawn emanating from the
same point, so that the vector connecting their tips is the change in velocity, δv ≍.v δt.
Thus the area of the shaded sector of the circle of radius v =

is given by

δv ≍

3See Westfall (1980, pp. 148–150).
4Newton’s perfectly minimalist notation is sometimes frowned upon, as the dot can be hard to see—in this work we have
attempted to address that concern by simply enlarging the dot!

and by an elementary result (which itself may be proved geometrically [exercise]), this area is half
the determinant of the matrix with these two columns:

two shaded triangles yields (8.7).
Note that if the particle’s horizontal speed is
ﬁxed at .x = 1, so that its orbit is (t, y[t]), then we
recover Newton’s original formula (8.3) as a special
case of (8.6). Indeed, this is precisely the manner in
which Newton himself carried out the simpliﬁca-
tion; again, see Knoebel (2007, pp. 182–185).

and δs = δt. Thus the change from the general
ﬁgure [8.6b] is that δv is now orthogonal to v, tan-
gent to the unit circle. As illustrated in [8.7], during
the time δt the tip of v now traces out an arc δφ of
the unit circle, its height rising by δ.y ≍..y δt =..y δs.
From the ultimate similarity of the two shaded
triangles, we deduce that

Thus, recalling that κ ≍(δφ/δs), (8.6) reduces to an extremely simple formula which (rather
strangely) is not readily found in standard texts: for a unit-speed orbit,
κ =..y/.x.
(8.7)
Likewise, from the same triangles, κ = −..x /.y. (See Ex. 1 for a less illuminating proof via
calculation.)

Example: Newton’s Tractrix
The constant negative Gaussian curvature of the pseudosphere can in fact be traced back to the
curvature of Newton’s tractrix, which generates it.
Given the parametric representation of the tractrix (see Ex. 16 on p. 88), its curvature can
be found via a routine calculation [exercise] based on (8.6). However, a geometric analysis of the
problem is more elegant and furnishes the answer in a form that will prove more useful in studying

far, we shall instead present an argument5 that is tailored to this particular curve.
Let

the segment pl of the normal from the tractrix to its axis,
as illustrated in [8.8]. (Later we will explain that ρ2 is also a radius of curvature, hence the use of
the same Greek letter for both distances.)
By deﬁnition, the tractrix in this ﬁgure has tangents of constant length R. At the neighbouring
points p and q, [8.8] illustrates two such tangents, pa and qb, containing angle •. The corres-
ponding normals po and qo therefore contain the same angle •. Note that ac has been drawn
perpendicularly to qb.

[8.8] The tractrix has κ = (ρ2/R2).
Now let’s watch what happens as q coalesces
with p, which itself remains ﬁxed. In this limit, o
is the centre of the circle of curvature, pq is an arc
of this circle, and ac is an arc of a circle of radius R
centred at p. Thus,

Chapter 9
Curves in 3-Space
The foregoing analysis of plane curves can be applied, with only minor modiﬁcation, to curves
that escape from the plane and twist their way through 3-dimensional space.
The essential insight is that even for such a twisting 3-dimensional orbit, each inﬁnitesimal
segment nevertheless lies in a plane (to which our previous analysis therefore applies), but this
instantaneous plane of motion (called the osculating plane) no longer remains ﬁxed in space but
instead rotates about the particle’s direction of motion as the particle travels along the curve. The
rate of rotation of the osculating plane is called the torsion, denoted τ.
[9.1] The Frenet Frame. Pressing the card-
board against the bent wire curve reveals the
osculating plane, with N pointing toward the
centre of curvature within that that plane. As
we move the frame along the curve, the tor-
sion τ is the rate at which the plane’s normal
vector B (called the binormal) rotates about T.
There can be no substitute for direct physical
experience of mathematical facts: do not merely try
to imagine the following experiment—please do it!
Physically construct the contraption shown in
[9.1], as follows. Cut a short section of a narrow
drinking straw and tape or glue it down on an
inﬂexible piece of stiff cardboard (or anything else
ﬂat and rigid). On the cardboard, draw a vector
T extending the segment of straw, and draw an
equally long vector N perpendicular to the straw,
as shown. Finally, construct a third vector of equal
length and attach it as the plane’s normal vector,
marked B in [9.1].
Take a sturdy piece of wire (perhaps a metal
coat hanger, cut open) and bend it into any non-
planar curve that suits your fancy. Now thread
the wire through the section of straw, and press
the cardboard against the curve so that it becomes
the osculating plane. Once ﬁtted to the curve in
this way, the orthonormal set of vectors (T, N, B) is
called the Frenet frame of the curve.
Holding the wire ﬁxed in space (ideally by
enlisting the help of a friend), slide your Frenet frame along the curve, all the while keeping the
cardboard in contact with the bent wire, as best you can, thereby ensuring that it continues to
represent the osculating plane. In this manner you will experience τ as the rate at which you must
rotate your piece of cardboard so as to keep it in contact with your curved wire.
Alternatively, if you are only interested in how the curvature κ varies along the curve, hold
the cardboard ﬁxed in one hand, with the thumb of that hand holding the wire down on the plane,
so as to ensure it is the osculating plane. With your other hand, you may then gradually pull the
wire through the straw, all the while pressing it against the cardboard with your thumb, and watch
the changing curvature of the piece of curve on the ﬁxed cardboard plane in your hand.
Returning to our previous discussion of plane curves for a moment, recall that the plane of
the curve is spanned by T and by N, and further recall that the direction of N can be deduced
from the rate of change of T, via (8.5): T′ = κN. (Recall that here the derivative is with respect to
arc length, which is the same as the time derivative only if the particle travels at unit speed.)
106

Curves in 3-Space
•
107
In the present case of a twisting 3-dimensional curve, we can turn this around and deﬁne N to
be the direction in which the tangent is turning:
N ≡T′
|T′|.
This normal N is called the principal normal, to distinguish it from the inﬁnitely many other
“normals” that lie in the plane perpendicular to T; it is distinguished by the fact that it lies in
the osculating plane, and that it points directly at the centre of curvature (instead of away from
it). Thus, a little more explicitly than before, the osculating plane, within which the particle is
momentarily moving, is the plane spanned by T and T′.
With these conventions in place, the acceleration of a unit-speed particle is always directed
toward the centre of curvature and its magnitude is the curvature. It therefore makes sense to
rechristen this acceleration as the curvature vector κ of this unit-speed particle:
κ ≡κ N.
(9.1)
As shown in [9.1], the orientation in space of the osculating plane is conveniently encoded in
its unit normal vector, denoted B, and called the binormal of the curve:
B ≡T×T′
|T′|
= T×N.
As we have said, the torsion is the rate of rotation of the osculating plane about the direction of
motion, T. Equivalently, it is the rate of turning of B about T.
We note the following simple but fundamental fact:
When a unit vector begins to rotate, its tip moves on the unit sphere, within
the tangent plane to the unit sphere at that point, and therefore in a direction
perpendicular to the vector itself.
(9.2)
As B rotates, its tip must therefore begin to move in a plane parallel to the osculating, cardboard
(T, N)-plane. Note, however, that here B cannot tip in the T direction, and its rate of change is
therefore purely in the N direction; make sure you can see this geometrically, perhaps with the
assistance of your toy Frenet frame. This can of course also be shown by calculation: see Exercise 2.
Thus
B′ = −τ N.
NOTATIONAL NOTE: The minus sign that is included in this deﬁnition of τ does not appear to us
to have anything to recommend it, but since the great majority of authors appear to include it, we
shall let discretion be the better part of valour!
As for the curvature, the foregoing analysis applies with only minor change. As before,
T spins within the osculating plane at a rate given by κ, and N spins with it, as in [8.5]. But now
N does not merely rotate within the osculating plane, for it must also remain orthogonal to B, so it

108
•
Chapter 9 Curves in 3-Space
rotates out of the osculating plane at the same rate as B rotates about T. In other words, applying
the geometric idea [8.5] twice, and in accord with (9.2), the total rate of change of N is given by
N′ = −κ T + τ B.
The rotation of the entire Frenet frame as we move along the curve can therefore be summ-
arized as the following matrix equation, known as the Frenet–Serret Equations:1

Let us retain a ﬁrm grasp on the geometry underlying the structure of [Ω]: the vanish-

([Ω]T = −[Ω]) is merely the algebraic manifestation of [8.5].
The matrix [Ω] itself tells us how the (T, N, B) frame rotates from one moment to the next. If
we watch the frame move along the curve for a short time δt, then
new frame after δt ≍[I + [Ω] δt] [original frame] .
For more on the rotation of the frame, see Exercise 3.

Chapter 10
The Principal Curvatures of a Surface
10.1
Euler’s Curvature Formula
In Act I we immediately and anachronistically launched into a discussion of Gauss’s revolutionary
1827 conception of the intrinsic geometry of surfaces, and with it his associated concept of the
intrinsic curvature K. But, historically, the natural progression from Newton’s investigation of the
extrinsic curvature of plane curves was the study of the extrinsic curvature of surfaces: how do
they bend within the surrounding space?
It was Euler in 1760 who made the ﬁrst fundamental breakthrough. We will ﬁrst describe his
discovery, and then prove it afterwards. At a point p on the surface S he considered the plane curve
Cθ through p obtained by intersecting S with a plane Πθ that rotates about the surface normal np
at p. See [10.1], which illustrates two orthogonal positions of this plane Πθ, on two different kinds
of surface. Here θ denotes the angle of rotation of Πθ, starting from an arbitrary (at least for now)
initial direction. As Πθ rotates, the shape of the intersection curve Cθ changes, and therefore its
curvature κ(θ) at p will (in general) vary too.
Before continuing, we should explain that κ(θ) has a sign attached to it, according to this
convention: the vector from p to the centre of curvature c of Cθ is deﬁned to be
1
κ(θ)n. Thus if
c lies in the direction of +n then κ(θ) is positive, while if it lies in the direction of −n then κ(θ)
is negative. Of course there are actually two opposite (equally valid) choices for n. Reversing
the choice of n reverses the sign of κ. Note that the principal normal (as deﬁned in the previous
section) of Cθ is therefore N = [sign of κ(θ)] n.
As θ varies, let κ1 and κ2 denote the maximum and minimum values of κ(θ). Euler’s elegant
and important discovery was that these extreme values of the curvature (the so-called principal
curvatures) will always occur in perpendicular directions, which are called the principal directions.
Furthermore, if we choose θ = 0 to coincide with the direction that has curvature κ1, he found

[10.1] [a] If κ1 and κ2 have the same sign then the surface locally resembles a hill, and a slice parallel to (and
close to) the tangent plane yields an ellipse (or misses the surface entirely). [b] If κ1 and κ2 have opposite sign
then the surface locally resembles a saddle. A parallel slice above the tangent plane yields both branches of a
hyperbola (as illustrated); slicing below the tangent plane yields both branches of an orthogonal hyperbola (not
shown).

Chapter 10 The Principal Curvatures of a Surface
Euler’s Curvature Formula: κ(θ) = κ1 cos2 θ + κ2 sin2 θ.
(10.1)
Although this is the standard form of the formula found in most modern texts, there is a
superior way of writing it, which was in fact the form in which Euler1 himself ﬁrst published it.
Substituting cos2 θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2 and sin2 θ = (1 −cos 2θ)/2, we obtain
κ(θ) = κ + ∆κ
2 cos 2θ,
(10.2)
where κ ≡
[ κ1+κ2
2
]
is the mean curvature, about which the value oscillates, and (∆κ/2) ≡(κ1 −κ2)
/2 is the amplitude of the oscillation. See the graph [10.2]. Note that the extremal nature of κ1 and
κ2, together with the orthogonality of the principal directions, can be deduced directly from this
formula. Furthermore, this form makes manifest the geometric fact that rotating the normal plane
by π returns it to the same position, so the variation in curvature has period π.

[10.2] Euler’s Curvature Formula tells us that as we vary the
angle θ of the normal section Cθ, its curvature κ(θ) oscillates
sinusoidally, achieving its maximum and minimum values in
perpendicular directions.
As illustrated in [10.1a], if κ1
and κ2 have the same sign then κ(θ)
always shares this same sign; i.e.,
the surface locally resembles a hill.
But if κ1 and κ2 have opposite signs
then κ(θ) changes sign; i.e., Cθ ﬂips
from one side of the tangent plane
to
the
other,
and,
as
shown
in
[10.1b], the surface locally resembles
a saddle.
Of course it is possible that κ1 =
κ2, in which case κ(θ) = const. at
p; in this case p is called umbilic,
and the surface locally resembles a
sphere. In general it can be shown
that such umbilics can only occur
in isolated places on a surface. Of
course the sphere of radius R is a
strong exception to this: every point
is an umbilic, with κ(θ) = 1/R. But it
can be proved that the sphere is the
only surface with this property.
In the exceptional case that the
umbilic has κ1 = 0 = κ2, the shape of the surface surrounding the point can be much more complex.
This will be discussed and illustrated in Section 12.4.
10.2
Proof of Euler’s Curvature Formula
We will now provide a geometric proof2 of Euler’s Curvature Formula. Choose p to be the origin
of the Cartesian (x, y, z) coordinates, and let the x and y axes be chosen to lie in the tangent planne
1The more familiar form (10.1) was derived from Euler’s result about 50 years later, by Charles Dupin, in 1813. See Knoebel
(2007, p. 188).
2The proof in the lovely article by Aleksandrov (1969) is similar, but it requires two calculations, which are here replaced with
geometry. The now-standard idea of using the quadratic approximation relative to the tangent plane is simpler than Euler’s
original approach; it was discovered by Jean-Baptiste Meusnier in 1776. See Knoebel (2007, p. 194).

10.2 Proof of Euler’s Curvature Formula

Tp at p. Then locally the surface can be represented by an equation of the form z = f(x, y), such
that f(0, 0) = 0 and Bxf = 0 = Byf at the origin. Expanding f(x, y) into a Taylor series, we deduce
that as x and y tend to zero,
z ≍ax2 + by2 + cxy.
(10.3)
Slicing through the surface with planes z = const.= k parallel to Tp, and very close to it, there-
fore yields intersection curves whose equations (as k goes to zero) are quadratics, ax2 + by2 +
cxy ≍k, and which are therefore (ultimately) conic sections.
Figure [10.1] illustrates the fact that these conics are ellipses if κ1 and κ2 have the same sign,
and that they are hyperbolas if κ1 and κ2 have opposite signs. In both cases, the conics have two
perpendicular axes of symmetry that are independent of the height k of the slicing plane. This follows
from the homogeneous quadratic nature of the equation. For example, quadrupling the height of
the slice just doubles the size of the conic, without changing its shape: k →4k and (x, y) →(2x, 2y)
yield the same equation as before.
The use of this conic to quantify the amount and type of bending of S at p goes back to
Charles Dupin in 1813, and it is called the Dupin indicatrix in his honour. The point p itself is
called elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic according to the type of the Dupin indicatrix at p.
Crucially, the symmetry of the conic sections implies that the surface itself has local mirror
symmetry in two perpendicular directions.3 We can now derive Euler’s Curvature Formula and
deduce that these two perpendicular planes of symmetry are in fact the same planes that yield the
maximum and minimum curvatures; i.e., these local mirror symmetry directions are the same as
the principal directions. To summarize what we shall prove,
An inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of a generic point of a surface has mirror sym-
metry in two perpendicular planes (both containing the surface normal), and the
perpendicular directions in which these plane intersect the tangent plane are the
principal directions of maximum and minimum curvature.
(10.4)
Reﬁning our coordinate system, we now align the x and y axes with these symmetry direc-
tions. Since the equation (10.3) is now invariant under the reﬂections x 7→−x and y 7→−y it follows
that c = 0, and the local equation of the surface therefore becomes
z ≍ax2 + by2.
(10.5)
To ﬁnd the geometric meaning of the coefﬁcients a and b we now refer back to [8.2] and view
it as depicting the intersection of Πθ with S: the curve C is now Cθ, and the tangent T is now the
intersection of the tangent plane Tp with Πθ, and the deviation σ of the curve from its tangent is
now simply the height z of the curve above the tangent plane.
Let θ = 0 correspond to the x-axis, and let κ1 = κ(0) be the curvature of C0 = (the intersection of
S with the xz-plane), having equation z = ax2. Then the result (8.2) shows that a = 1
2κ1. In exactly
the same way, deﬁning κ2 = κ( π
2 ) to be the curvature of the intersection curve with the yz-plane,
we ﬁnd that b = 1
2κ2. Thus (10.5) can be expressed more geometrically as
z ≍1
2κ1x2 + 1
2κ2y2.
(10.6)
Now consider [10.3], which depicts the curve Cθ for a general angle θ. (This diagram assumes
(and others to follow do as well) that the Gaussian curvature is positive, but the accompanying

[10.3] The principal curvatures tell us how quickly the surface falls away—downwards in this ﬁgure—from the
tangent plane as we begin to travel in each of the two perpendicular principal directions. When we instead move
a distance ϵ within the tangent plane in a general direction θ, the distance z that the surface falls away is simply
the sum (according to (10.6)) of the falls due to each of these two components separately.
reasoning applies equally well to negatively curved surfaces.) If we move a distance ϵ within Tp
in the direction θ then we arrive at the illustrated point x = ϵ cos θ, y = ϵ sin θ. Thus inserting (10.6)

tures κ1 and κ2 associated with the orthogonal directions of local mirror symmetry.
10.3
Surfaces of Revolution
If we rotate a plane curve C about a line L within its plane, then we obtain a surface of revolution S
for which the principal directions are easily identiﬁed. Figure [10.4] illustrates this in the particular
case in which C is the tractrix, L is its axis, and therefore S is the pseudosphere.
Clearly S has mirror symmetry in each plane through its axis L, so the intersection of such a
plane with S (which is simply a copy of C), yields one of the principal directions within S.
At a point p on S let us choose this direction along the copy of C to correspond to θ = 0, so that
using the previous notation C = C0. Thus the ﬁrst principal curvature κ1 = (1/ρ1) is simply (up to
sign) the curvature of the original plane curve C.
The second principal direction at p must therefore be the direction within S perpendicular to
this plane through L. The radius of curvature ρ2 associated with this second principal direction is
in fact simply the distance pl, in the direction of the normal n to the surface, from p to the point l
on the axis L:
ρ1
=
radius of curvature op of the generating curve C,
(10.7)
ρ2
=
the distance pl along the normal n to the axis L.
(10.8)
To conﬁrm this, let us use the same notation as before and denote the intersection of S with
this perpendicular plane as C(π/2). If we rotate lp about L then it sweeps out a cone and p moves
within S along the circular edge of this cone, which initially coincides with C(π/2).

Now recall Newton’s original

bouring normals of a curve. In the
present case of C(π/2), the neigh-
bouring normals are generators of
this cone, meeting at l, thereby con-
ﬁrming that κ2 = ±(1/ρ2), the sign
depending on the choice of n.

radius r and centre o about a line L at distance R from o. See [10.5]. We imagine that C is traced by a

Leaving behind speciﬁc examples, sup-
pose now that C is a general curve, but traced
at unit speed by a particle moving in the (x, y)-
plane, whose position at time time is x = x(t)
and y = y(t). See [10.6].
Let us take L to be the horizontal x-axis,
and rotate C about this axis to generate a sur-
face S. Let us choose n pointing to the left of
the direction of motion, as illustrated. Using
(10.7) and (8.7), we deduce the ﬁrst principal
curvature for a curve traced at
unit speed:
κ1 =..y/.x.

As we previously noted regarding (8.7), the result (10.11) may equally well be expressed as
κ1 = −..x /.y. Check for yourself [exercise] that these formulas yield the correct sign for κ1, no matter
where we are on the curve.

Let the curve C be rotated about the line L to generate the surface of revolution
S. Then the parts of C that are concave towards L generate parts of S that have
positive curvature, and the parts of C that are concave away from L generate
parts of S that have negative curvature. Inﬂection points of C generate circles
on S where the curvature vanishes; these circles separate the regions of opposite
curvature.

Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
11.1
Geodesic Curvature and Normal Curvature
To us, as inhabitants of the Earth’s surface, a great circle is not only analogous to a line in that
it provides the shortest route between two points, but it also appears to be straight: it has no
apparent curvature. If you walk in a “straight line” across a seemingly ﬂat desert, you are actually
walking along such a great circle, whose curvature in 3-space is 1/(radius of the Earth). How shall
we reconcile these two conﬂicting views of one and the same curve?
The answer, in short, is that the full curvature in 3-space of a general curve within a
general surface S can be decomposed into two components: one within the surface (visible to its

[11.1] When the circle C in the plane P is projected
orthogonally onto the plane eP, at angle α to P, the dis-
tance from the common tangent T contracts by cos α,
and therefore the size of the curvature vector at p does
too: eκ = κ cos α.
inhabitants), and another perpendicular
to the surface (invisible to the inhabi-
tants). The visible component within the
surface is called the geodesic curvature,
denoted κg; the invisible component per-
pendicular to the surface is called the
normal curvature, denoted κn.
If the osculating plane is perpendicu-
lar to the surface, i.e., contains the surface
normal n, then all of the curvature is “nor-
mal curvature” (κn = κ) and none of it is
visible “geodesic curvature” within the
surface (κg = 0). This was the case for our
great circle on the surface of the Earth.
Now suppose instead that you are
standing in middle of a seemingly ﬂat
desert, and you trace a very small circle of
radius r in the sand at your feet. You thus
obtain a seemingly planar curve with very
large curvature κ = 1/r. But of course the
desert is part of the curved surface of the
Earth, and from this perspective all that is
special about your curve is that its oscu-
lating plane almost coincides with Earth’s
tangent plane at your location. In this case we have almost the reverse of the former case: almost
all of the curvature is now geodesic curvature, but in fact there is still the same amount of invisible
normal curvature as before, as we shall explain shortly.
In fact the general case may be thought of as simply an appropriate mixture of the two
extreme cases described just previously.
The essential point really has little to do with surfaces, per se, rather it has to do with how
the curvature of a plane curve changes when it is projected (casts a shadow) on another plane.
See [11.1], which shows a circle C of radius (1/κ) within a plane P, the tangent at p being T.

Chapter 11 Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
The ﬁgure also shows the orthogonal projection eC of C onto a second plane eP through T, the
angle between the planes being α. As you probably know [or exercise] eC is in fact an ellipse, the
original circle C having been compressed in a direction perpendicular to T. Thus it is clear that the
curvature eκ of eC at p is less than the original curvature κ.
More precisely, the ﬁgure shows that under this projection the distance from the common
tangent T undergoes a compression by cos α, so that eσ = σ cos α. Thus, by virtue of (8.2),
eκ ≍2eσ
ϵ2 = 2σ cos α
ϵ2
≍κ cos α.
By thinking of C as the circle of curvature of a general curve C, we see that this formula applies
to C as well:
If a plane curve C (with tangent T at p) is projected orthogonally onto a second
plane that passes through T and makes angle α with the ﬁrst plane, then at p the
projected curve eC has eκ = κ cos α.

[11.2] The net acceleration κ can be
decomposed into the geodesic curvature
vector κg tangent to the surface, and the
normal curvature vector κn perpendicu-
lar to the surface: κ = κg + κn.
This result can also be understood vectorially, and
perhaps even more intuitively, in terms of motion. As
we have discussed, if a particle traverses C at unit speed
then it is appropriate to rename the particle’s accelera-
tion as the curvature vector κ = κN, for this acceleration
vector points towards the centre of curvature and its
magnitude equals the curvature.
Next, observe [exercise] that the acceleration of the
projection equals the projection of the acceleration. Note,
however, that the projected orbit eC will in general not
be traced at constant speed, and its acceleration vec-
tor will therefore have a component tangent to eC and
will therefore not be orthogonal to eC, in contrast to eκ.
(Remember, eκ is the acceleration the particle would have
had if it traversed eC at constant unit speed.) This break-
down of orthogonality also makes sense geometrically:
in [11.1] a radius of C projects (in general) to a line in
eP that is no longer orthogonal the image ellipse eC. That
said, p is an exception to this, and as the particle and its shadow momentarily move together at
unit speed through p along T,
eκ = (projection of κ onto eP),
as illustrated in [11.1]. By equating the lengths of these vectors, (11.1) follows immediately.
Now let us return to the original problem, in which C is a general curve on a surface S. See
[11.2]. As before, let T denote the unit tangent to C at p, let Tp be the tangent planethe tangent plane
to S at p, and let us also introduce ΠT as the normal plane spanned by n and T. Let the osculating
plane be inclined at angle γ to the tangent plane Tp; equivalently, γ is the angle between the
binormal B of C and surface normal n of S. Thus κg and κn are the curvatures of the projections
of C onto Tp and ΠT, respectively. Then (11.1) implies that
κg = κ cos γ
and
κn = κ sin γ.
(11.2)
Again, this can also be understood in terms of acceleration. Imagine particles traversing the
projections of C onto Tp and ΠT at unit speed. Their respective accelerations will then be the

geodesic curvature vector κg and the normal curvature vector κn, pointing toward the respective
centres of curvature in the tangent and normal planes, and with magnitudes equal to κg and
κn, respectively. As illustrated in [11.2], the acceleration can then be decomposed into these two
orthogonal components:
κ = κg + κn.
(11.3)
From this (11.2) follows immediately.

Meusnier’s Theorem
p
R
r
γ
[11.3] Slicing a sphere of radius R through
the north pole p with a plane at angle γ
to the horizontal yields a circle of radius
r = R sin γ.
Consider the family of all curves (such as C) on S that
pass through p in the particular direction T. The inhab-
itants of S may freely draw curves of this type that are
tightly curved, slightly curved, or not curved at all: κg
can be freely and arbitrarily speciﬁed. However, the
same is not true of the normal curvature κn: the bend-
ing of the surface itself forces all curves within it to bend
in the n direction.
In fact, as Meusnier realized in 1779, the surface
forces all such curves to bend by the same amount: κn
is independent of the speciﬁc curve C, so, in particular,
κn must equal the curvature of the normal section in
this direction. More intuitively, this says that all of these
curves locally have the same projection onto ΠT: near p,
these projections all look like the normal section, which
in turn looks like a circle within ΠT of radius (1/κn)
centred at (1/κn)n.
Even granted this, it’s clear, however, that this
curve-independent normal curvature must in general
depend on the direction T of the family of curves as they pass through p. Thus we may write the
common normal curvature of the family as a function κn(T) of this direction. (For example, if e1
and e2 are the principal directions, then κn(e1,2) = κ1,2 are the principal curvatures.) Combining
this (as yet) unproven claim with (11.2), we can state
Meusnier’s Theorem. All curves that pass through a point p of a curved surface
in the same direction T have the same normal curvature κn(T) as the normal
section in that direction. If the osculating plane at p of one such curve makes
angle γ with the tangent plane at p, and its curvature there is κγ, then κγ sin γ =
κn(T) is independent of γ.
(11.4)
Before giving a general argument, consider the sphere of radius R, for in this special case the
truth of the theorem is easy to visualize. See [11.3]. Taking p to be the north pole, the normal section
is a great circle (a meridian) of radius R and hence the curvature κn = (1/R). Slicing through the
north pole with a plane at angle γ to the horizontal tangent plane at p, the intersection with the
sphere will be a circle of radius r = R sin γ, and hence κγ = 1/r = 1/(R sin γ).

Chapter 11 Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
Returning to the introductory example of a small circle drawn in the sand, imagine that γ
tends to zero, in which case the radius of the circle shrinks to zero, and the length of its curvature
vector tends to inﬁnity. But, simultaneously, this curvature vector is tending towards orthogonal-
ity with the surface normal, so that less and less of it projects onto that direction. These two effects
cancel each other out exactly, so that the projection of the curvature vector onto the surface normal
has constant magnitude:
κγ sin γ = 1
R = κn,
conﬁrming this instance of the theorem.
For the general case, imagine that C is traced by a particle at unit speed, and let T denote its
velocity vector, not just at p but along the entire orbit. Then, by (11.3),
.
T = κ = κg + κn
=⇒
κn(T) =.
T·n.
But for the same essential reason as in [8.5], .
T·n = −T·.n, so
κn(T) = −T·.n.
(11.5)
But .n is the rate of change of the surface normal in the T direction, which is independent of C,
thereby proving the theorem.
11.3
Geodesics are “Straight”
We have deﬁned geodesics via their length-minimizing property within the surface. But the
geodesics of the Euclidean plane (lines) may also be recognized by their straightness. Likewise, on
the sphere we have just seen that the geodesics (great circles) not only provide the shortest routes,
but they too are “straight,” in the sense that none of their curvature is visible to inhabitants of the
surface: κg = 0. In fact this connection between length minimization and intrinsic straightness is
universal:
Geodesics appear to be straight lines to the inhabitants of the surface: they are
intrinsically “straight” in the sense that their geodesic curvature vanishes: κg = 0
at every point of the geodesic.
To begin to understand this, imagine a guitar string in its straight-line equilibrium position L
being plucked with a pick whose position in space is p. As the pick pulls the string away from L,
the string forms a triangle in the plane Π containing p and L. Once released, the net force, resulting
from the string’s compulsion to shorten its length, acts within Π and the resulting motion back
towards L all takes place within that plane. Next, suppose that instead of pulling the string away
from L into a sharp triangle in Π, we pull it away into the form of a gentle convex curve lying in
Π, then the resulting forces and motion will again clearly reside within Π.
Now let us return to our curved surface and picture our geodesic as a guitar string stretched
taut over the (frictionless) surface to connect two ﬁxed points. The string is at rest: it is in equi-
librium on the surface, already having slid over the surface, contracting to become as short as
possible. Now focus attention on a very short segment apb of the geodesic. This segment will
almost lie in a single plane Γ, namely, the one through a, p, and b. As a and b approach p, the

limiting position of Γ is the osculating plane at p, which we shall denote Πp. By the forgoing
reasoning, the net length-shrinking force Fp acting on apb will ultimately lie within Πp.
If Fp were to have any component tangent to the surface, the string would be free to move
in this direction, thereby reducing its length. But since the string is already as short as possible,
this cannot happen! Thus, having no component within the surface, the force Fp (lying within Πp)
must be directed perpendicularly to the surface, along the normal np. Thus we have reached an
important characterization1 of the geodesic in terms of the extrinsic geometry of the surface:
At every point p of a geodesic, the osculating plane Πp contains the surface
normal np, and hence the geodesic curvature vanishes: κg = 0.
(11.6)
Intrinsic and extrinsic geometry appear to be belong to entirely different worlds, and yet
we see here that the two are strangely entangled. Later we shall witness even deeper and more
mysterious connections between these two worlds.
11.4
Intrinsic Measurement of Geodesic Curvature
We have just seen that vanishing geodesic curvature characterizes geodesics, but we may also
use geodesics as an intrinsic tool with which to measure the geodesic curvature of a nongeodesic
curve, for which κg ̸= 0.
C
δs
δφ
[11.4] The surface’s inhabitants can measure the geodesic
curvature κg of the curve C by constructing tangent
geodesics to the curve at neighbouring points δs apart, then
ﬁnding the angle δφ at which these tangents intersect. As
the points merge, κg ≍(δφ/δs).
In (8.4) we saw that the curva-
ture of a curve in the Euclidean plane
may be viewed as the rate of rotation
of its tangent line with respect to dis-
tance along the curve. Well, this orig-
inal construction (illustrated in [8.4])
also makes perfectly good sense to the
inhabitants of the surface.
From their perspective there is
no change at all to the construction.
See [11.4]. They draw tangent “lines”
(dashed geodesics) to the curve at
neighbouring points δs apart, ﬁnd the
angle δφ at which these tangents inter-
sect, then calculate the curvature (in the
limit that the points merge) as κg ≍
(δφ/δs).
But what they call the curvature of
the curve, we recognize as being only
one part of the curvature, its geodesic curvature κg; the normal curvature κn is invisible and
unknowable to them. The only other difference between their intrinsic perspective and our extrin-
sic perspective (looking down on the surface) is that what they call “straight lines” we recognize
as geodesics within their surface.
Of course if C is itself a geodesic then both tangents coincide with C, so δφ = 0, and therefore
κg = 0, as it should.
1This characterization was ﬁrst discovered by Johann Bernoulli in 1697, who then taught it to his student, Euler.

A Simple Extrinsic Way to Measure Geodesic Curvature
In Act I we discussed the fact that if we peel away from a curved surface a narrow strip centred
on a geodesic G, then when that strip is laid down on a ﬂat plane it becomes a straight line eG. See
[1.11] on page 12. Thus the intrinsic straightness (κg = 0) of G on the surface manifests itself as
ordinary straightness in the plane: the curvature eκ of the ﬂattened strip eG vanishes.
If we likewise remove from the surface a narrow strip centred on a nongeodesic curve C,
for which κg ̸= 0, then ﬂatten it onto the plane, we obtain a plane curve eC for which its ordinary
curvature eκ ̸= 0. See [1.12] on page 13.
So how is the geodesic curvature κg(p) at a particular point p on the surface related to the
curvature eκ(ep) of the ﬂattened strip at the corresponding point ep of eC in the plane?
Let κg(p) denote the geodesic curvature at p of a curve C on a curved surface, and
let eκ(ep) denote the curvature at the corresponding point of the plane curve eC into
which C is carried when a narrow strip centred on C is ﬂattened onto the plane.
Then
κg(p) = eκ(ep).
To see this, take the intrinsic construction [11.4] and imagine peeling narrow strips off the
surface around the entire construction: around C, and also around both of the small dashed seg-
ments of tangent geodesics meeting at angle δφ. When the small triangle of connected peeled
strips is laid ﬂat in the plane, we have returned to the original construction [8.4] for measuring
curvature. The ﬂattened geodesics have become straight lines in the plane, and since these lines
are still tangent to eC, they are tangent lines. But neither δs nor δφ are altered in the ﬂattening pro-
cess, so κg(p) ≍(δs/δφ) ≍eκ(ep), as claimed. To see this, take the intrinsic construction [11.4] and
imagine peeling narrow strips off the surface around the entire construction: around C, and also
around both of the small dashed segments of tangent geodesics meeting at angle δφ. When the
small triangle of connected peeled strips is laid ﬂat in the plane, we have returned to the original
construction [8.4] for measuring curvature. The ﬂattened geodesics have become straight lines in
the plane, and since these lines are still tangent to eC, they are tangent lines. But neither δs nor δφ
are altered in the ﬂattening process, so κg(p) ≍(δs/δφ) ≍eκ(ep), as claimed.
11.6
A New Explanation of the Sticky-Tape Construction of Geodesics
We originally used the length-minimizing property of geodesics to explain the construction (1.7),
whereby a geodesic is constructed by rolling a narrow strip of sticky tape down onto the sur-
face, starting at an arbitrary point, and heading off in an arbitrary direction of our choosing.
But, as we have been discussing, geodesics can also be characterized by their straightness: van-
ishing geodesic curvature. We now use this property to provide a new, second explanation of our
geodesic construction.
Consider a narrow, straight strip of tape, L, lying ﬂat in the plane, with centre line L. The line
L is extrinsically straight in R3; i.e., κ = 0. It is also intrinsically straight within L: κg = 0. Now let
us pick up L and isometrically bend and twist it in space into any shape we please. The centre line
L remains intrinsically straight within whatever new form L now takes, so κg = 0, still. Thus the
curvature vector is normal to the strip all along L:
κ = κg + κn = κn.

[11.5] As the particle q travels along the geodesic L at unit speed, the radius sweeps out area at a constant rate,
and therefore its projection onto Π does too. It follows that ρ sin ψ is constant along L, which is a special case
of Clairaut’s Theorem.
Now roll the strip down onto a smooth surface S. As we explained on page 14, only the centre
line L can actually make contact with S, but at each point of contact, p, the tangent plane of the
strip coincides with the tangent plane of the surface: Tp(L) = Tp(S).
But we just established that κ is normal to the strip L all along L, but this means that it is also
normal to the surface, S. Thus, viewed as a curve within S, the geodesic curvature of L vanishes,
and it is indeed a geodesic of S.
11.7
Geodesics on Surfaces of Revolution
11.7.1
Clairaut’s Theorem on the Sphere
Geodesics are extremely hard to ﬁnd explicitly on all but the simplest surfaces. However, there
exists one general class of surfaces for which we can give an explicit geometrical recipe (called
Clairaut’s Theorem) for the paths of the geodesics: surfaces of revolution.
Of such surfaces, the sphere is one of the simplest; the Ancients already knew its geodesics—
the great circles. We now look afresh at these great circles, and expose a hidden property that they
possess, one that we will then be able to generalize to all surfaces of revolution.
Consider the sphere [11.5], thought of as the surface of revolution generated by rotating
a semicircle about the vertical z-axis. As this semicircle (or indeed a general generating curve)
rotates about the axis, its creates the so-called meridians of the surface. Equivalently, these are the
curves of intersection of the surface with planes through its axis of symmetry, and the same is true
on a general surface of revolution. On the sphere these meridians are the great circles through
the poles, perhaps better known as circles of longitude. It is no accident that these meridians on
the sphere are geodesics; as we already noted in the footnote on page 53, and as we shall discuss
shortly, the meridians on a general surface of revolution are necessarily geodesics, too.

Chapter 11 Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
If we watch the particle moving along its great circle orbit L at unit speed for time ∆t then
the radius will rotate within the plane of L by ∆θ = (∆t/R). Thus the radius sweeps out area
A = 1
2R2∆θ = 1
2R∆t, and so area is swept out at a constant rate: the same area A will be swept
out in each equal period of time ∆t. Historically, this situation is summarized by saying that equal
areas are swept out in equal times.
Now let us project this orbit vertically downward onto the equatorial plane Π. This projection
P is a linear transformation, and therefore all areas are contracted by the same factor, the deter-
minant of the transformation. In fact it is easy to see geometrically [exercise] that if the plane of L
makes an angle γ with Π, then det P = cos γ.
It is also easy to see that the projection of the circular orbit L is an elliptical orbit P(L) in Π. It
follows that as the particle travels round this ellipse, the radius in Π also sweeps out equal areas in
equal times. In greater detail,
d e
A
dt = cos γdA
dt = 1
2R cos γ.
Since P(L) is an ellipse, this steady generation of area is only possible if the projected particle
moves slower when it is further away and faster when it is closer in. This variation in speed is
readily conﬁrmed and quantiﬁed by noting [exercise] the following:
If q(t) is any trajectory in space, the velocity of the orthogonal projection
P(q) onto a plane Π is the projection of the velocity: d
dtP[q] = P
h dq
dt
i
.
(11.7)
The tangent plane Tq (not drawn) is spanned by the tangents to the orthogonal circles of
longitude and latitude. As illustrated, the direction of the geodesic at q can be described by the
angle ψ it makes it makes with the meridian through q. If the particle q moves for a short time ϵ
it will travel a small distance ϵ along the great circle orbit. Thus the horizontal component of the
motion along the circle of latitude is ϵ sin ψ, as illustrated. It follows that the unit velocity vector
to the geodesic, lying within Tp can be decomposed into a horizontal component sin ψ along the
circle of latitude, and a component cos ψ along the circle of longitude (meridian).
The component along the meridian projects to radial motion in Π, generating no area. The
area generation is entirely due to the horizontal component sin ψ, which projects to an equal com-
ponent perpendicular to the radius ρ in Π; note that ρ is the distance of the original particle from
the axis of symmetry, as illustrated.
Since the rate of generation of area in Π is 1
2ρ sin ψ, we deduce that this quantity is constant
along the original great circle orbit, and is given by,
1
2ρ sin ψ = 1
2R cos γ = const.
While this formula could have been demonstrated directly from the geometry of the sphere, the
advantage of the above argument is that we will soon be able to generalize it to obtain,
Clairaut’s Theorem. Let S be a surface of revolution generated by rotating a
curve C about an axis L. If ρ is the distance from the axis L to a point q on
a geodesic g, and ψ is the angle between the meridian Cq through q and the
direction of g, then ρ sin ψ remains constant as q travels along the geodesic g.
Conversely, if ρ sin ψ is constant along a curve g (no part of which is a parallel
of S), then g is a geodesic.

HISTORICAL
NOTE: Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713–1765) was a French mathematician,
astronomer, and geophysicist, who helped to extend Newton’s results in the Principia. In 1752 he
published an accurate, usable, approximate solution to the three-body problem of the Sun, Earth,
and Moon, which Euler declared to be “. . . the most important and profound discovery that has ever
been made in mathematics.” (Hankins, 1970, p. 35) The naming of the general theorem above stems
from Clairaut’s 1733 investigation of quadratic surfaces of revolution.
11.7.2
Kepler’s Second Law
In order to understand the general version of Clairaut’s Theorem, let us ask, what is the magni-
tude and direction of the force that holds P(q) in its orbit P(L)? To answer this, we note the simple
generalization of (11.7) from velocity to acceleration:
If q(t) is any trajectory in space, the acceleration of the orthogonal projection
P(q) onto a plane Π is the projection of the acceleration: d2
dt2 P[q] = P
h d2q
dt2
i
.
(11.9)
Suppose for simplicity’s sake that the particle orbiting on the sphere in [11.5] has unit mass,
so that force is equal to acceleration. The force F that holds q in this orbit L is directed along the
normal to the sphere, pointing directly at the centre, O, and it has constant magnitude (v2/R) =
(1/R), since the particle has unit speed. Thus the force eF that holds the projection in its elliptical
orbit in Π is also directed at O, and by virtue of the illustrated similar triangles,
eF

|F| = ρ
R
=⇒
eF
 = (1/R2)ρ.
A force ﬁeld that is directed towards a single point O is called a central force ﬁeld. We have
just established that the central force ﬁeld in which the magnitude of the force directed to the
centre of force is proportional to the distance of the particle from O results in an elliptical orbit centred
at O that sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This was ﬁrst proved by Newton (using a quite
different argument) in the Principia (Proposition 10).
In practical terms, this force ﬁeld and orbit can be created as follows. Imagine Π to be a fric-
tionless sheet of ice, with a small hole at O. Take a small ice puck, and attach to it a length l of
elastic string. Pass the length of string through the hole, and rest the puck on top of the hole. Take
the other end of the elastic, hanging down at distance l below the hole, and attach it to a ﬁxed
point. Sitting at O, the puck experiences no pull from the string, because the string is relaxed at its
natural length l. But if we move the puck a distance ρ away from O, thereby stretching the string
by ρ, Hooke’s Law then tells us that the stretched elastic will pull the puck back towards O with
a force proportional to ρ. If we now launch the puck across the ice in an arbitrary direction with
arbitrary speed, it will indeed trace an elliptical orbit centred at O, sweeping out equal areas in
equal times. It is not hard to create an (ice-free) approximation of this experiment at home, and we
encourage you to do so.
The fact that the orbit is an ellipse centred at O is speciﬁcally linked to the fact that the force
varies linearly with distance. But, as Newton was the ﬁrst to recognize and prove, the fact that
equal areas are swept out in equal times is a remarkable universal property of all central force ﬁelds!
We shall describe Newton’s beautiful proof momentarily, but ﬁrst let us pause to understand the
pivotal role of this result in the Principia.
By analyzing the painstakingly accurate observations of the planets taken over a period of
years by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was able to discern mathematical

124
•
Chapter 11 Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
patterns within the mass of data before him. These empirical mathematical facts are now known
as Kepler’s Three Laws of Planetary Motion. Kepler announced the ﬁrst two laws in 1609, and the
third (after tremendous struggles) in 1618:
Kepler’s Laws
(I) The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
(II) A line segment joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal
times.
(III) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the
semi-major axis of its orbit.
For the next 70 years these laws would remain a mystery. Finally, in 1687, Newton succeeded
in mathematically explaining Kepler’s Laws as logical consequences of his universal, Inverse-
Square Law of Gravitation—a spectacular vindication of his ideas. But in order for Newton to
be able to achieve his analysis of dynamics using geometry alone (see Prologue) it was essential for
him to be able to be able to represent time as a geometrical quantity.
Kepler’s Second Law, or rather Newton’s generalization of it to arbitrary central force ﬁelds,
was therefore absolutely critical to the entire enterprise—it stands as Proposition 1 of the Principia.
Newton’s legion geometric diagrams and associated proofs in the Principia simply would not have
been possible without this one absolutely fundamental fact: area is the clock.
11.7.3
Newton’s Geometrical Demonstration of Kepler’s Second Law
Figure [11.6] contains six copies of Newton’s own diagram for Proposition 1 of the Principia,
embellished so as to tell the story (as in a comic strip) of Newton’s argument, establishing that
in any central force ﬁeld directed towards the ﬁxed point S, the orbit ABCDEF sweeps out equal
areas in equal times.
In the absence of any force, the ﬁrst panel shows a particle travelling from A to B in a straight
line, at uniform speed, as dictated by Newton’s First Law of Motion; in this period of time, the
radius from a ﬁxed point S sweeps out the shaded area SAB. In the next equal increment of time,
the particle will continue on an equal distance from B to c, still in the plane SAB, sweeping out
the cross-hatched area SBc. But these two areas are equal, for the illustrated shear along BA brings
SBc into coincidence with SAB. Thus, in the absence of force, equal areas are swept out in equal
times.
Now suppose, instead, that at the moment the particle arrives at B it receives a sharp tap
directed towards S. If the particle had been at rest at B initally, then this tap would have caused
it to travel from B to v in the same time that it formerly travelled from B to c. The actual motion
of the particle with therefore be the sum of these two motions, from B to C, still in the plane SAB,
sweeping out the darkly shaded, cross-hatched area SBC. But this area is again equal to the original
area SAB, for the illustrated shear parallel to SB carries SBC to SBc, and then (as before) a second
shear brings SBc into coincidence with SAB.
Suppose we give the particle a second tap2 towards S as it arrives at C, then it will travel
from C to D, and, by the same reasoning as before, the area SCD will again equal the area SAB.
Continuing in this manner, tapping the particle towards S at equal time intervals (at D, E, F, . . .)
the polygonal orbit ABCDEF sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
2Note that Newton’s diagram appears to take the magnitude of each tap to be equal, but his argument is equally valid if the
taps are unequal.

Newton concludes,
Now let the number of triangles be increased and their width decreased indeﬁnitely, and their
ultimate perimeter ADF will be a curved line; and thus the centripetal force by which the body is
continually drawn back from the tangent of the curve will act uninterruptedly, while any areas
described will be proportional to those times Q.E.D.
The remarkable elegance and economy of Newton’s reasoning was not lost on Richard Feynman,
who said3 to his Caltech class in 1964,
The demonstration you have just seen is an exact copy of one in the Principia Mathematica by
Newton, and the ingenuity and delight you may or may not have gotten from it is that already
existing in the beginning of time.
Lastly, observe [exercise] that the converse is also true; this is Proposition 2 of the Principia:
Every body that moves in some curved line described in a plane and, by a radius drawn to a point
describes areas around that point proportional to the times, is urged by a centripetal force tending
towards that same point.

Dynamical Proof of Clairaut’s Theorem
We are now but a step away from a satisfying explanation of Clairaut’s Theorem on a general
surface of revolution, as illustrated on the vase shown in [11.7].
As the point q moves along a geodesic g on this surface, the acceleration of the orbit is (by
deﬁnition) always directed along the surface normal n, and its direction therefore intersects the
axis of symmetry L. But, by virtue of (11.9), the projection of g onto Π is an orbit P(g) whose
acceleration is therefore directed towards O, and so by Newton’s generalized version of Kepler’s
Second Law, P(q) sweeps out area at a constant rate in Π. But, in the short time δt = ϵ, the particle
q travels a distance ϵ along the geodesic on the surface, and its projection sweeps out an area δA
on the plane Π that is ultimately equal to the area of the white triangle with base ρ and height
ϵ sin ψ. Thus δA ≍1
2ρϵ sin ψ, and so dA
dt = 1
2ρ sin ψ is constant. This completes the explanation of
the ﬁrst part of Clairaut’s Theorem.
Note that meridians (ψ = 0) are exceptional geodesics, in the sense that their projections in Π
move in and out radially, generating no area.
As for the converse, suppose ρ sin ψ is constant along a curve g on S. Then P(q) sweeps out
area in Π at a constant rate. Therefore, by Proposition 2 of the Principia (above), it follows that the
acceleration of P(q) is always directed towards O. And from this it follows that the acceleration of
g itself is always directed at the axis L; equivalently, it lies within the vertical plane through q and
L, containing n; equivalently, it is perpendicular at q to the parallel through q.
Next, assume the small segment of g containing q is not a parallel. Then v is not tangent to
the parallel (ψ ̸= π
2 ). Thus the acceleration is perpendicular to two distinct directions in S: the direction
of the parallel, and the direction v of g. Thus the acceleration is directed along n, and so g is a
geodesic, as was to be shown.
But suppose the segment of g containing q is part of a horizontal, circular parallel ℘, such as
the top rim of the vase in [11.7]. Note that ρ sin ψ is indeed constant on ℘, by virtue of the fact that
ρ and ψ are both separately constant, with ψ = (π/2). But now, as illustrated, the acceleration is
horizontal and directed towards the centre of the circular parallel, and this horizontal direction is
in general not perpendicular to the surface, and hence ℘is (in general) not geodesic.

However, ℘is geodesic in the exceptional case that n is horizontal along ℘; an example is
indicated in [11.7]. Such parallels ℘are called critical, and can be characterized in various ways.
For example, if the vertical cylinder with axis L containing ℘touches S along ℘, then ℘is geodesic.
Most textbooks instead describe this situation by supposing that the generating curve C of S can be
described by a graph ρ = ρ(z), where z is vertical distance along L. Then the parallel ℘is geodesic
if and only if it is “critical” in the sense that ρ′(z) = 0; in other words, the distance of the proﬁle
curve from L has a maximum, a minimum, or a point of inﬂection.

Chapter 11 Geodesics and Geodesic Curvature
For readers who have studied some physics, we note that the quantity ρ sin ψ = Ωis the angu-
lar momentum about the axis L of the (unit-mass) particle. The fact that Ωremains constant can
be understood physically4: it is a consequence of the fact that the force that holds q in its geodesic
orbit on S passes through L and therefore has no moment about L. In exactly the same way that
a spinning ice-skater spins faster as she pulls her arms in, so, in order to conserve its angular
momentum, the particle orbiting on the surface must spin around L faster as it comes closer to
L. But since the particle on the surface has constant linear speed along the geodesic, it can only
increase it angular speed around the axis by directing its velocity towards the horizontal.
Note that the angular momentum Ωof a geodesic g actually tells us the closest g can get to L:
ρ =
Ω
sin ψ ⩾Ω= ρmin.
For example, suppose g starts below the critical latitude (of radius R) at the throat of the vase in
[11.7], and then climbs upward towards it. If the angular momentum is too large (Ω= ρmin > R)
then the g cannot ever reach the throat of the vase; instead, it bounces back down the vase. This
is the case for the illustrated geodesic, which will likewise be forced to bounce back up again as
it approaches the narrow base. To get a better feel for all this, try using a real vase, constructing
geodesics using the sticky-tape construction, (1.7), page 14. See Exercise 11, page 26.
11.7.5
Application: Geodesics in the Hyperbolic Plane (Revisited)
Let us now apply Clairaut’s Theorem to the pseudosphere, so as to gain a fresh view of the
geodesics of the hyperbolic plane.
Since the pseudosphere becomes arbitrarily narrow the higher up we go, it follows from
the discussion above that if a particle is travelling up the pseudosphere and has any angular
momentum at all, it must eventually turn back and head back down. Thus the meridian, tractrix
generators (which have zero angular momentum) are the only geodesics than can continue indeﬁ-
nitely upward.
Recall the construction of the Beltrami–Poincaré upper half-plane map of the pseudosphere,
which we derived geometrically in [5.4], page 55. What we had called X in that ﬁgure is now called
ρ. Thus the height y in the map (given by (5.4), page 55) is
y = 1
ρ,
where we have chosen the radius of the pseudosphere to be R = 1, in order to obtain the standard
model of the hyperbolic plane, for which
K = −(1/R2) = −1.
Figure [11.8] shows a geodesic g (starting at a and ending at b) on the pseudosphere and its
image in the map (starting at A and ending at B). Recall that we previously proved (using optics)
that this image is a semicircle meeting the horizon y = 0 at right angles. We can now give a fresh
proof of this fact using Clairaut’s Theorem, and in the process give a new interpretation of the size
of the semicircle representing g.
Recall that this map is, by construction, conformal. That means that the angle ψ between g and
the tractrix generator (meridian) of the pseudosphere is preserved: The image of g in the map makes
the same angle ψ with the vertical half-line image of the tractrix. If the unit-mass particle travelling
along g has angular momentum Ω, then Clairaut’s Theorem yields,
ρ sin ψ = Ω
=⇒
y = 1
Ωsin ψ.

[11.8] A unit-mass particle travels at unit speed along a geodesic g on the pseudosphere of radius R = 1. By
Clairaut’s Theorem, its angular momentum Ω= ρ sin ψ is constant. But since the Beltrami–Poincaré map is
conformal, the angle ψ is preserved, and it follows that the image G in the map has equation y = 1
Ωsin ψ,
which is a semicircle of radius (1/Ω) meeting the horizon y = 0 at right angles.
Thus, using exactly the same reasoning as in [5.8], page 60, we conclude that,
If a unit-mass particle travels at unit speed along a geodesic g on the pseudosphere,
and its angular momentum about the axis of symmetry is Ω, then its image in
the Beltrami–Poincaré upper half-plane travels along a semicircle meeting y =
0 at right angles. Furthermore, the radius of this semicircle is (1/Ω). In other
words, the (Euclidean) curvature of the semicircle is the angular momentum of
the particle.
Lastly, let h be highest point that the particle can reach before its angular momentum Ωforces
it to head back down the pseudosphere. Clearly, h is mapped to the highest point H on the image
G of g, both h and H corresponding to ψ = (π/2). It follows from (5.1) that the arc length σmax
along the segment of the tractrix generator (not shown) going from the rim straight up to h, is
given by the logarithm of the radius of G:
σmax = ln 1
Ω.

The Extrinsic Curvature of a Surface
12.1
Introduction
We have seen how the two principal curvatures (together with their associated principal direc-
tions) characterize the extrinsic geometry of a surface in great detail, via Euler’s curvature formula,
(10.1). But is there is single number (without any associated direction) that can characterize the
overall extrinsic geometry of a surface at a point, in the same way as the Gaussian curvature K
characterizes the intrinsic geometry?
To characterize the overall extrinsic geometry we must presumably take some kind of average
of the principal curvatures. The two most obvious ways of doing this are to take their arithmetic
mean, κ1+κ2
2
, or else their geometric mean, √κ1κ2. Both of these averages are geometrically natural
and extremely important.
The arithmetic mean is usually denoted by the letter H (or κ) and it is simply called the mean
curvature:
H = κ ≡κ1+κ2
2
.
(12.1)
Look again at the signiﬁcance in [10.2] of H to the graph of Euler’s curvature formula: it is the
centre about which the curvature oscillates sinusoidally. This mean curvature H is fundamental to
understanding the shape of so-called minimal surfaces, which include the shapes of all possible
soap ﬁlms spanning a complicated curved wire frame. These minimal surfaces must, by deﬁnition,
satisfy H = 0 at every point, so that κ2 = −κ1, and the surface is saddle-shaped. As noted in the
Prologue, we shall not explore these fascinating surfaces in this work; instead, we refer you to the
Further Reading section, where several excellent works are recommended.
The geometric meaning of √κ1κ2, or rather its square, κ1κ2, turns out to be even more funda-
mental than that of H, but we shall deliberately keep you in suspense a little longer as to what that
signiﬁcance might be. Forgive us, but even the great Gauss declared it to be one of the greatest
punchlines in all of mathematics, so a few pages of drum-roll is in order. (If you cannot bear to
wait, jump ahead to the answer: (13.3) on p. 142.)
12.2
The Spherical Map
As we know, the curvature κ of a plane curve C can be deﬁned as the rate of turning of its tangent.
Equivalently, κ may be viewed as the rate of turning of the normal. This latter interpretation will
permit us to generalize this extrinsic deﬁnition of curvature from curves to surfaces, for the latter
also admit a unique (±) normal vector.
First, however, it will be helpful if we reinterpret the rate of turning of a plane curve’s normal
vector as the spread of the directions of the normal vectors that occurs over a short piece of the
curve, say of length δs.
To quantify this, imagine taking each of these unit normal vectors and transplanting them so
that they all emerge from a common point O. See [12.1]. In this way, the normal N may be viewed

[12.1] The map N is deﬁned to send the point p on C to the point on the unit circle lying in the same direction
as Np. Then κ ≍(δφ/δs) can be reinterpreted as the local length magniﬁcation factor of N, measuring the
rate of spreading of the normals.
as a mapping N from the point p of the plane curve C to the the point ep = N(p) on the unit circle
S1 (centred at O) that lies at the tip of Np.
Over the segment δs of C, the directions of the normal vectors are spread over angle δφ, and
therefore the tips of these normal vectors ﬁll an arc of length δes = δφ on the unit circle. The local
spreading of the normal vectors can now be quantiﬁed by considering the local magniﬁcation of
arc length under the normal map:
κ = local length magniﬁcation factor of the N map ≍δes
δs.
(12.2)
This suggests a way to generalize the construction to a surface S. Consider a small patch of
S of area δA and containing the point p, the normal vector there being np. See [12.2]. By analogy
with [12.1], we introduce the spherical map—most commonly called the Gauss map, or the normal
map—from the surface to the unit sphere (n : S →S2) sending the point p to the point ep = n(p) on
the unit sphere lying in the same direction as np.
HISTORICAL NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY: In essentially all other texts, the “spherical map” is
instead called the “Gauss map,” but this is historically inaccurate. Yes, Gauss did indeed publish
it in 1827 (and privately used it years earlier), but it was Olinde Rodrigues (1795–1851) (a French
banker and amateur mathematician) who ﬁrst published this concept in 1815, employing it in a
penetrating study of the curvature of surfaces. In recognition of this fact, Marcel Berger (one of the
foremost geometric authorities of the late twentieth century) calls it the Rodrigues–Gauss map,
which seems to us to strike an appropriate balance. That said, we shall generally prefer the term
“spherical map,”1 by virtue of its clarity and brevity.
12.3
Extrinsic Curvature of Surfaces
We are thus led to a brand new extrinsic measure of surface curvature in terms of the spread of the
normal vectors, which we shall temporarily denote Kext.
1A strong precedence argument can also be made for “spherical map”: it was the name preferred by such legendary ﬁgures as
Hilbert (1952) and Hopf (1956). It has likewise been employed by I. M. Singer, V. A. Toponogov, and other famous differential
geometers of the modern era.

[12.3] If S is a sphere of radius R cen-
tred at O, and the image S2 under n is
imagined to be concentric to it, then n is sim-
ply radial projection from O. Thus distances
within S are compressed by (1/R) and areas
on S are compressed by (1/R)2.
For example, suppose S is a sphere of radius
R centred at O, and picture the image S2 under the
spherical map as having the same centre. Then n
is simply radial projection from O, as illustrated in
[12.3]. Linear dimensions clearly shrink by (1/R) and
areas therefore shrink by (1/R)2, so
The sphere of radius R has extrinsic
curvature Kext = (1/R2).
(12.4)
As a second example, let S be a cylinder of
radius R with axis L, as illustrated in [12.4]. All
points on the same generator of the cylinder have
the same normal vector and hence the same image
under the spherical map. Since all the normals of S
are perpendicular to L their images under n lie on
the great circle of S2 that lies in the plane perpendic-
ular to L. Thus any area on S is crushed down by n
to an arc of this great circle, having zero area. Note
that the same crushing of generators also occurs on
a cone, thus
The cylinder and the cone both have Kext = 0.
(12.5)
In contrast to (12.2), it is not immediately obvious that the magniﬁcation factor in (12.3) is
uniquely deﬁned in the general case. However, later we shall be able to show that it really is: all

inﬁnitesimal areas at a given point undergo the same magniﬁcation, regardless of their shape. For
now, let us assume this and seek a speciﬁc shape that will reveal an explicit formula for Kext.
To help us ﬁnd a special shape for which the area magniﬁcation factor is geometrically self-
evident, two lemmas are needed, the ﬁrst of which is this:
As p begins to move in a principal direction, np remains within the normal plane
Π in that direction.
(12.6)
A bit more precisely, we mean by this that if ζ is deﬁned to be the angle between n and Π, so
that ζ(p) = 0, then .
ζ(p) = 0. This follows from the local mirror symmetry of S in Π, for if n were
to immediately rotate out of Π to one side or the other (.

ζ < 0) this would violate the
symmetry (10.4).

rotates out of Π. We strongly encourage you to conduct your own such experiments, using
whatever fruits or vegetables are readily available.
If we think of the left-hand side of [12.2] as a cross-section of S, drawn in the plane Π, and
the right-hand side as a cross section of S2 in the plane parallel to Π through O, the second lemma
follows immediately:
If p moves along a short vector vi in the ith principal direction of S, then n(p)
ultimately moves along −κivi on S2.
(12.7)
Note that the minus sign in this formula is due to our conventions: in [12.5a] n(p) moves in
the same direction as vi, a positive multiple of vi, but (by our convention) here κi < 0, because the
normal section bends away from our chosen n.
We are thus guided to consider the fate under the spherical map of a small rectangle whose
sides are aligned with the principal directions. Let the lengths of these sides be ϵ1 and ϵ2, along the
ﬁrst and second principal directions, respectively. By virtue of (12.7), the spherical map ultimately
sends this rectangle to another rectangle on S2, parallel to the original, but with the sides ultimately
stretched to κ1ϵ1 and κ2ϵ2. Thus,
δ e
A ≍(κ1ϵ1)(κ2ϵ2) ≍(κ1κ2) δA,
and therefore (12.3) yields
Kext = κ1κ2.
(12.8)
For example, on a sphere of radius R, κ1 = κ2 = (1/R), yielding Kext = (1/R2), in agreement
with (12.4). Note that if the principal curvatures of a general surface have the same sign, then we
obtain the following interpretation of their geometric mean: the extrinsic curvature of the surface
is the same as that of a sphere of radius 1/√κ1κ2.
As another example, a cylinder of radius R has κ1 = (1/R) and κ2 = 0, yielding Kext = 0, in
agreement with (12.5). A cone also has one vanishing principal curvature, and hence Kext = 0
in this case, too.
HISTORICAL NOTE: Both the extrinsic deﬁnition (12.3) of curvature and the explicit formula
(12.8) are almost universally attributed to Gauss (1827). However, as with the spherical map (aka
the Rodrigues–Gauss map) itself, both of these insights were in fact ﬁrst published by Rodrigues
in 1815, twelve years prior to Gauss. It appears that Gauss (along with most twentieth-century
mathematicians!) was simply unaware of Rodrigues’s discoveries. For more on this history, see
Kolmogorov and Yushkevich (1996, p. 6) and Knoebel (2007, p. 118).
The formula (12.8) attaches a sign to Kext: if p is elliptic (i.e., κ1 and κ2 have the same sign) then
Kext > 0; if it is hyperbolic (i.e., κ1 and κ2 have opposite signs) then Kext < 0; and if it is parabolic
(i.e., one of the κi vanishes) then Kext = 0.
In order to make sense of this sign of Kext in terms of its original deﬁnition (12.3), we take δA
to be positive and we use a simple geometric property of the spherical map to attach a sign to δ e
A,
as follows.
Imagine that, with n pointing at your eye, you see the boundary of δA on S traced counter-
clockwise, as illustrated in [12.6]. The idea is to attach a sign to the area δ e
A on S2 according to
whether the spherical map preserves or reverses the orientation of the boundary. That is, we take
δ e
A to be positive if its boundary is traced in the same counterclockwise sense (as seen from outside
the sphere) that the original was, and we take it to be negative if it is traced in the opposite, clockwise
sense.

What Shapes Are Possible?
Let us analyze systematically what shapes are possible for an arbitrary surface, at least locally.
In the immediate vicinity of a generic point, we have seen that the surface is described by the
quadratic in (10.6) and repeated here:
z ≍1
2κ1x2 + 1
2κ2y2.
In general, neither principal curvature vanishes, so Kext = κ1κ2 ̸= 0. Recall that a point is called
elliptic if Kext > 0, and called hyperbolic if Kext < 0. The shape of the surface in the vicinity of such
a generic point is completely determined by this distinction regarding the sign of Kext:
If Kext > 0 then the surface is locally a bowl, as in [12.7a].
If Kext < 0 then the surface is locally a saddle, as in [12.7b].
(12.9)
The remaining case K = 0 can arise in two different ways: either one principal curvature van-
ishes, or both do. In the former case, the point is called parabolic, and in the latter case it is called
planar, for reasons that will become clear shortly.

[12.7] The local shape of the surface is [a] a bowl if Kext > 0; [b] a saddle if Kext < 0; [c] a trough if Kext = 0
(and only one of κ1 and κ2 vanishes). If both principal curvatures vanish, then the surface can be arbitrarily
complex; [d] illustrates just one possibility, called the monkey saddle.
In the former parabolic case, suppose that κ1 ̸= 0 and κ2 = 0. Then the surface is locally given
by z ≍1
2κ1x2, which is a trough (with a parabolic cross section) running in the y-direction, as
illustrated in [12.7c].
The surface of a doughnut provides examples of all three cases thus far considered. Every
point on the outer half of the doughnut has positive curvature, and looks like [12.7a], and every
point on the inner half of the doughnut has negative curvature, and looks like [12.7b]. If we imag-
ine the doughnut sitting on a plate, the circle of contact with the plate separates the two halves of
opposite curvature, and is made up of parabolic points where Kext = 0. Sure enough, the strip of
surface surrounding this circle is indeed a trough, like [12.7c]. For a diagram that focusses on this
circular trough, look ahead to [13.3a], page 141.
In the ﬁnal “planar” case, K = 0 again, but now both principal curvatures vanish. Since κ1 =
κ2 = 0, we see that z must be ultimately be equal to a cubic (or higher-powered) homogeneous
polynomial in x and y. It makes sense that such a point is called planar, because the curvature
of the normal section vanishes in every direction, like a plane, and the surface departs from its

tangent plane so slowly that it does indeed look very plane-like locally. But of course as we move
further away, or simply look with greater precision, we can see the surface bending away from the
tangent plane. As we shall now explain, the shape of the surface near such a planar point can be
arbitrarily complicated.
To prepare ourselves for the more complicated behaviour that the surface can exhibit near
a Kext = 0 planar point, let us ﬁrst take a fresh look at a regular Kext < 0 saddle. For simplicity’s
sake, let us assume that κ1 = −κ2 = 2. Now let us think of the tangent plane as the complex plane, so
that each point within it can be described (with Cartesian and polar coordinates) by the complex
number x + iy = r eiθ. Then,
Height of saddle =
 x2 −y2
= Re (x + iy)2 = Re

r2 ei2θ
= r2 cos 2θ.
This new form of the height formula makes it transparent that as we circle once around the
origin, the surface does two complete oscillations in height. If we picture an actual saddle on a
horse, then the “valley” of the saddle on one side of the horse corresponds to one of these two
complete oscillations of height, and it accommodates one of the rider’s legs, while the second
complete oscillation provides the valley on the other side, for the other leg. And directly in front
and behind the rider, the saddle rises up in what we shall call “hills.”
Now let us construct a saddle suitable for a monkey, who has two legs and a tail; note that the
ofﬁcial, technical name for this surface is indeed the monkey saddle! To create the three equally
spaced valleys the monkey requires, we need only cube our complex number:
Height of monkey saddle = Re (x + iy)3 = Re

r3 ei3θ
= r3 cos 3θ.
This monkey saddle is illustrated in [12.7d].
Note that the three valleys are now equally spaced, (2π/3) apart, and the three hills are like-
wise equally spaced in between the valleys: each hill is directly opposite a valley. As you can
see, this means that the normal sections necessarily have an inﬂection point at the origin, implying
(without calculation) that the curvature must vanish there. Since the normal curvature vanishes
in every direction, the monkey saddle does indeed have a planar point at its centre.
It is now easy to see that there exists an inﬁnite menagerie [sic] of such saddles, of ever increas-
ing complexity, of which the monkey saddle may be described as the 3-saddle. For example, if we
want to create a cat saddle—which we must confess is not standard terminology!—we need only
replace the third power of the monkey saddle with the ﬁfth power, to create the 5-saddle, with
height given by r5 cos 5θ.
Note that it is visually clear that all these saddles have strictly negative curvature everywhere
except at the planar point itself, where Kext = 0. In fact it can be shown (see Ex. 20) that the cur-
vature Kext of the general n-saddle is symmetrical around the origin: it only depends on r and
therefore has a constant negative value on each circle r = constant.
We have not yet exhausted all possible shapes surrounding a planar point. While all the
higher-order saddles have negative curvature surrounding the planar point of vanishing curva-
ture, it is also possible to have the planar point be surrounded by a sea of positive curvature. For
example, consider [exercise] the almost ﬂat-bottomed bowl with equation z = r4 = (x2 + y2)2.

Gauss’s Theorema Egregium
13.1
Introduction
In 1827 Gauss announced the Theorema Egregium—Latin for “Remarkable Theorem.” Although
that year witnessed the death of Beethoven, the appearance of the Theorema Egregium meant that
it also witnessed the birth of modern Differential Geometry.
From this result sprang fundamental advances in both mathematics and physics, some of
which we have touched on already, and some of which must await future chapters. It paved
the road to Beltrami’s crucial 1868 step in the acceptance of Hyperbolic Geometry, interpreting
it as the intrinsic geometry of a saddle-shaped surface of constant negative Gaussian curva-
ture. And Riemann’s brilliant generalization of Gauss’s intrinsic curvature to higher-dimensional
manifolds in turn enabled Einstein in 1915 to give precise mathematical form to his supremely
beautiful and supremely accurate General Theory of Relativity, in which gravitation is under-
stood as the curvature impressed upon the intrinsic geometry of space and time by matter and
energy.
But in order to properly appreciate the Theorema Egregium itself, we shall ﬁrst describe
its origins. The fascinating and insightful work of Dombrowski (1979) uses Gauss’s private
notebooks, letters to friends, and ofﬁcial publications to carefully piece together a chronology
of Gauss’s evolving insights into Differential Geometry in general, and into this theorem, in
particular. As Dombrowski explains, Gauss’s epic explorations began in 1816, when he made a
nonlocal discovery about the curvature of surfaces that was profound and unexpected in equal
measure.
13.2
Gauss’s Beautiful Theorem (1816)
Gauss was not given to gushing. But if he was stingy in his praise of others, then at least he was
not a hypocrite. A succession of his major discoveries lay hidden in his private notebooks till after
his death because he deemed them insufﬁciently perfected to be worthy of publication. Indeed,
his Latin motto was pauca, sed matura, “few, but ripe.” One such unpublished discovery was the
nonlocal result of 1816.
Agonizingly, even in his private notebook1 Gauss left no trace of what led him to suspect the
result, nor how he proved it, but with uncharacteristic exuberance he was moved to name it:
“Beautiful Theorem. If a curved surface on which a ﬁgure is ﬁxed takes different
shapes in space, then the surface area of the spherical image of the ﬁgure is always
the same.”

A on S2, traversed in the opposite sense to the original, because of the negative
curvature. Bending the banana skin by pulling the ends towards each other distorts the image on S2, yielding [b]:
The image on S2 is now a squarer quadrilateral, but the area e
A is exactly the same as before!
What Gauss means here by the “spherical image” is the image on S2 under the spherical map.
Figure [13.1] illustrates the meaning of the theorem with a banana peel; we strongly encourage
you to try this (or similar) experiment yourself. First, we have peeled one strip of peel from the
positive-curvature side and have removed the banana itself, leaving the remainder of the peel
surface intact. On the negatively curved part of peel we have drawn a squarish, counterclockwise
loop, and on this loop we have erected normals (toothpicks).
Under the spherical map this loop is mapped to a narrow quadrilateral on S2 of area e
A, tra-
versed in the opposite sense to the original, as illustrated in [13.1a]. Make sure to follow the loop on
the banana with your eye, conﬁrming that the tip of the normal does indeed trace such a reversed
image on S2.
If we now pull the ends of the banana towards each other, the skin undergoes an isometry, and
the normals along the boundary of our patch deform to produce a squarer image on S2. According
to the Beautiful Theorem, this new spherical image has exactly the same area as before!
Such experiments provide exciting and tangible manifestations of the underlying mathemat-
ical truth, (13.1), but they explain nothing. In Act IV we shall introduce the concept of parallel
transport, and with its assistance we shall be able to provide an elegant conceptual explanation

their radii remains constant: Kext is invariant.
of the Beautiful Theorem; for now, though, we will simply assume it, and thereby deduce as its
consequence the Theorema Egregium.
13.3
Gauss’s Theorema Egregium (1827)
Gauss did not publish a single word on the subject for another decade, but in private he returned
to Differential Geometry and to his Beautiful Theorem many times, most intensely in 1822 and
1825, even writing and then abandoning a full-length manuscript.2 At last, in 1827 he was satis-
ﬁed, publishing the result as the centrepiece of his Disquisitiones Generales Circa Superﬁcies Curvas
(“General Investigations of Curved Surfaces”3), and he allowed pent-up excitement to get the bet-
ter of him. What he had privately described to himself as “beautiful” he now announced to the
world as “remarkable”—the Theorema Egregium.
But by this point Gauss had almost totally covered his tracks from the original nonlocal dis-
covery of 1816, and the form of the result that he presented to the world was purely local. To see
how he was led to this new local version of the result, take the ﬁgure occurring in the Beautiful
Theorem and simply shrink it down towards a point p.
Let δA be the original area on S surrounding p and let δ e
A be the image area on S2 surrounding
n(p). Naturally, δA is invariant under isometries of S, and by virtue of the Beautiful Theorem (13.1)
δ e
A is also invariant. The “remarkable theorem” follows immediately:
Theorema Egregium. The extrinsic curvature Kext ≍(δ e
A/δA) is invariant
under isometries of S and therefore belongs to the intrinsic geometry of S. More
explicitly, while the principal curvatures individually depend on the shape of the
surface in space, their product does not: κ1κ2 is invariant under isometries.

Figure [13.2] illustrates this with another banana peel, and again we urge you to try this
experiment yourself. Pull the ends of the banana toward each other, and watch what happens at a

[13.3] When the outer half of the circular trough in [a] is reﬂected across the plane upon which it rests, we
obtain the isometric surface [b]. Yet [a] cannot be continuously deformed into [b] without stretching the surface.
Nevertheless, the Theorema Egregium assures us that the two surfaces have equal curvature at corresponding
points.
particular point p: the radius of curvature ρ1 shrinks (for the principal direction running the length
of the banana), while the cross-sectional radius of curvature ρ2 expands. But according (13.2) the
product ρ1ρ2 remains perfectly constant throughout the bending.
To conﬁrm this experimentally, take two small lengths of fairly stiff wire and bend them
to ﬁt the surface of the banana in its natural state (before removing the fruit inside) in the two
principal directions at a particular point, thereby obtaining two small pieces of the principal circles
of curvature there. Now lay these two small pieces of circle ﬂat on a table and use a ruler to
estimate their radii ρ1 and ρ2, and hence their product ρ1ρ2. Now have a friend bend the banana
peel and hold it steady while you again ﬁt the pieces of wire to the new surface at the same point
as before, in the new principal directions.4 Finally, conﬁrm that the new value of ρ1ρ2 is the same
as before, within the limits of experimental error.
The word “bending” implies continuous deformation, but this is not actually required by the
theorem: there do exist isometries that cannot be carried out via gradual, continuous isometric
deformation, but which nevertheless preserve the curvature by virtue of the theorem.5
To illustrate this we shall describe an example of Aleksandrov (1969, p. 101). Figure [13.3] is
a freehand copy of Aleksandrov’s original picture. Figure [13.3a] depicts a circular trough, which
we imagine to rest on a plane, touching it along a circle C. To obtain the surface in [13.3b], cut
the surface into two along C, then reﬂect the outer half in the plane.
Clearly this new surface is
isometric to the original surface, yet it also intuitively clear (and can be proven) that the original
surface is rigid and cannot be bent into the new shape without stretching the surface in the process.
Note that if we had instead performed an analogous transformation of a straight trough (a half-
cylinder) then the new surface could have been obtained by a continuous deformation, without
stretching.
A word about bending of physical “surfaces” versus mathematical ones. A physical surface,
no matter how thin, cannot actually be bent without any stretching. For example, take a piece of
paper and roll it into a cylinder, joining the edges together with tape. Both sides of the sheet began
with the same length, but the cylinder has an outer circumference that is very slightly greater
than the inner one: the outside had to be stretched, creating tension within the material. It is for
this reason that when you remove the tape, the sheet will spontaneously spring back to it original
planar form. Only in the mathematical limit of vanishing thickness can a surface be bent without
any stretching.
Gauss’s result (13.2) is indeed remarkable, but he took it still further. Since the result shows
that Kext is actually an intrinsic measure of curvature, it is natural to ask how it might be related
4We deliberately chose a point and a deformation such that the principal directions did not change. However, in general the
principal directions will spin within the surface as the bending occurs.
5It is not clear if Gauss himself was aware of this distinction, but it is certainly true that he expressed the Theorema Egregium in
terms of isometries, rather than bendings. It was only later authors who paraphrased Gauss as saying that Kext was “invariant
under bending.”

to our original intrinsic deﬁnition (2.1) (see p. 18) of Gaussian curvature K, as the angular excess
per unit area: K ≍E(∆)/A(∆). Gauss’s answer is very remarkable:
The extrinsically deﬁned curvature Kext = κ1κ2 and the intrinsically deﬁned
Gaussian curvature K are numerically equal:
Kext = K.
(13.3)
In light of this result, we can and will drop the distinction between these two measures of
curvature, enabling us to speak simply of the curvature K of the surface.
As with the Beautiful Theorem itself, the simplest and most general proof of this wonderful
result must await the introduction of the concept of parallel transport in Act IV. However, in the
next chapter we shall be able to lend some plausibility to the result via a more limited argument
concerning polyhedra.
In the meantime, let us conﬁrm the validity of (13.3) for some speciﬁc surfaces for which
we have already calculated both the extrinsic principal curvatures and the intrinsic Gaussian
curvature.

so the Gaussian curvature of these two surfaces vanishes. Combining this fact with (12.5),

The Curvature of a Spike
14.1
Introduction
[14.1] How can we measure the curvature of the spiked
surface of the durian?
Thus far we always imagined our sur-
face to be perfectly smooth, with a well-
deﬁned tangent plane and associated nor-
mal vector at each point. But consider
[14.1], which shows the spiked surface of
the durian,1 here shown with one of its
interior yellow fruits exposed.
Regardless of whether we approach
this surface from the extrinsic or the
intrinsic point of view, how on Earth shall
we deﬁne the curvature at the tip of one of
the durian’s many spikes?!
Once we have answered this question
we shall be able to shed some new light on
the Theorema Egregium.
14.2
Curvature of a Conical Spike
Suppose our spike takes the form of the tip of a cone. As we discussed in the last section, the
curvature of the cylinder and the cone both vanish, at least at every point other than the tip of
the cone. While the vanishing intrinsic curvature of the cylinder is easy to accept, we balk at the
cone’s “ﬂatness,” and with good reason.
Imagine yourself as a two-dimensional inhabitant of the cone’s surface, standing at the vertex.
You construct a circle centred there of radius r and measure its circumference C(r). You quickly
discover that C(r) is less than the Euclidean prediction of 2πr. This discrepancy clearly signals
the presence of curvature, and this curvature must reside at the tip, and nowhere else, for the
curvature at typical points has been shown to vanish.
To discuss this in more detail, suppose that the internal angle from the axis of symmetry to
the cone’s surface is α. See [14.2]. Intuitively, any reasonable measure of curvature should increase
as α becomes smaller and the spike becomes sharper; conversely, it should diminish to zero as α
approaches π/2, for in that limit the cone ﬂattens out into a Euclidean plane.
Unlike a mathematical cone, the tip of a physical cone will not be perfectly sharp, but will
instead be slightly blunt and rounded. We may gain some mathematical insight if we now imagine
this rounded tip to be in the form of a polar cap of a sphere that ﬁts smoothly onto the cone, in the

equals that of the illustrated cylinder of height (1 −sin α).
sense that there is a well-deﬁned tangent plane along the join between the cone and the polar cap.
See [14.2].
As the ﬁgure illustrates, the spherical map merely expands this blunted tip into a similar polar
cap on the unit sphere. It now seems reasonable to (provisionally) deﬁne the curvature of the spiked
tip of the original mathematical cone to be the total curvature residing within the blunted tip of the
physical cone. For it is clear that this deﬁnition does not depend on the size of the blunted tip: as
we shrink its radius, making it sharper and sharper,2 the size of the spherical image on the unit
sphere does not change. Furthermore, even without calculation, it seems clear that the dependence
on α of this measure of curvature conforms to our previously described intuition.
Thus we make this deﬁnition:
K(spike) ≡total K of blunted tip = area of the (polar cap) spherical image.
It is also possible to pass directly from the original (unblunted) cone tip to this same spherical
image. Imagine a horizontal plane resting on the tip of the cone, and imagine a unit normal vector
attached to the plane, pointing straight up. Taking this unit normal to be the n of our spherical
map, this horizontal position of the plane is mapped by n to the north pole on the right of [14.2].
The plane is free to rock in any direction until it hits the side of the cone and becomes tangent to
the surface, at which point n lies on the boundary of the polar cap. Thus, as the plane resting on the
tip assumes all possible positions, n ﬁlls the same polar cap as before. We call this the generalized
spherical map.
Regardless of how we arrive at this spherical image, let us now ﬁnd a formula for its area. By
virtue of a result by Archimedes (see Ex. 10, page 85), the area of the polar cap equals the area of
its illustrated projection onto the cylinder touching the unit sphere along its equator. Thus, since
the cylinder has circumference 2π, and this segment of it has height (1 −sin α), then
K(spike) = area of spherical image = 2π(1 −sin α).
(14.1)
Note that this formula for the curvature does indeed achieve its maximum when α = 0, and it also
vanishes when α = (π/2), as anticipated.
There is another way way of looking at this result, a way that will shortly offer a natural gen-
eralization of curvature to polyhedral spikes. See [14.3]. Suppose we cut one unit along a generator

of the cone, starting at the tip (the vertex), then cut horizontally around the cone. If we ﬂatten this
out we obtain a sector of a unit circle, bounded by the two sides of the cut, now split apart by
angle β. Clearly β is also a measure of curvature of the original spike. In fact we will now show
that it is exactly the same measure of curvature.
On the left of [14.3] we see that the circumference of the base is 2π sin α. But this length does
not change when the cone is cut and ﬂattened to produce the sector of the unit circle on the right.
Thus,
2π sin α = 2π −β.
Therefore (14.1) can be re-expressed as
K(spike) = β = Split angle of ﬂattened spike.
(14.2)
Both of these formulas (14.1) and (14.2) for Kspike employ extrinsic ideas that are unknowable
to the inhabitants of the cone: the ﬁrst involves the 3-dimensional concept of the normal to the
surface, while the second involves the ﬂattening of the surface within three-dimensional space.
Nevertheless, it is in fact a simple matter to reinterpret the second formula intrinsically.
Returning to the discussion at the start of the section, the circumference C(r) of a circle of
radius r centred at the vertex is related to the curvature by [exercise] the following intrinsic formula
for β:
K(spike) = 2πr −C(r)
r
= 2π −C(1).

The Intrinsic and Extrinsic Curvature of a Polyhedral Spike
In the case of the cone we have just seen that there is a natural way of measuring the curvature of
the spike both intrinsically and extrinsically, and these two measures turn out to coincide. As we
now explain, the same is true of the vertex v of a polyhedral spike, at which we shall suppose that
m ﬂat, polygonal faces f1, f2, . . . , fm come together, the outward normal of fj being nj.
The generalization of the last two interpretations (14.2) and (14.3) of K(spike) is straightfor-
ward, so we begin there. As with the cone, suppose we cut down along one of the edges, starting

at v and ending at an arbitrary point p, then cut a sideways circuit around v across all the fj, ﬁnally
returning to p, thereby cutting off the spike from the polyhedron.
Imagine the polyhedron to made up of stiff cardboard polygons, attached along their edges
with sticky tape, so that each edge acts like a hinge. (Such a model is shown in [14.4].) Then, since
it has been cut along vp, the detached spike may now be ﬂattened out onto the plane, the two
sides of the cut vp ending up split apart by angle β. If θj is the angle between the edges of fj that
meet at v, and Θ ≡∑θj is the sum of the angles that meet at v, then clearly β = 2π −Θ. Lastly, this
can be reexpressed intrinsically as the circumference C(1) of a unit circle centred at v drawn within
the original polyhedral surface:
Kint(v) = split angle of ﬂattened spike = β = 2π −Θ = 2π −C(1).
(14.4)
The extrinsic deﬁnition of curvature can also be generalized, via the generalized spherical
map. As we did with the cone, imagine a plane Π (with normal n) resting in contact with the spike.
As Π rocks and assumes all possible positions, all the while remaining in contact with the
spike, what image region does n ﬁll on S2?

14.4 The Polyhedral Theorema Egregium
•
147
The limits of motion of Π are determined by the faces: we can rock Π until it hits and coincides
with a face fj, at which point n coincides with nj, the normal to fj. The limits of Π’s motion are
thus determined by the m points nj on S2. Next, observe that
As the plane Π rocks over the vertex v, the spherical image n on S2 ﬁlls the interior
of the m-gon Pm on S2 with vertices nj.
To see this, we need only imagine Π initially coincident with fj, then rolling over the edge
e in which fj and fj+1 meet. As it does so, n must swing within the plane perpendicular to e,
and therefore the image n on S2 travels along the arc of the great circle connecting nj to nj+1.
The geodesic arcs connecting the successive nj therefore form the boundary of the region that n
covers, as Π rocks over all possible positions.
We have thus arrived at a natural conception of the extrinsic curvature of v:
Kext(v) = area on S2 of m-gon connecting the polyhedron’s normals.
(14.5)
14.4
The Polyhedral Theorema Egregium
Just as happened with the cone, the intrinsic and the extrinsic measures of curvature of the poly-
hedral spike turn out to coincide, a result which we may reasonably call the Polyhedral Theorema
Egregium:
Kext(v) = Kint(v).
(14.6)
Figure [14.4] illustrates the theorem in action: as the spike is ﬂexed, and the normals all rotate
in different directions, the spherical image Pm changes, but, according to the theorem, its area is
actually intrinsic to the spike, and therefore cannot change! Compare this with the picture of the
ﬂexing banana skin in [13.1] on page 139.
To understand this, consider [14.5]. The explanation, in a nutshell, is that the area of the
spherical polygon only depends on its angles, and the ﬁgure demonstrates that these are in turn
determined by the intrinsic angles of the polyhedron’s faces.
On the left, two edges of the polyhedron meet at angle θ, and the planes perpendicular to
these edges meet at angle eθ. It follows from the marked right angles that θ + eθ = π. Thus, under
the generalized spherical map, the corresponding edges of the spherical polygon meet at angle
eθ = π −θ.
We can now verify the result in detail. Recall that in Exercise 5 on page 83 we generalized
Harriot’s Theorem from triangles to polygons, showing that the area A(Pm) of a spherical m-gon
Pm is once again equal to its angular excess:
A(Pm) = E(Pm) ≡[angle sum] −(m −2)π.

[14.5] On the left, two edges of the polyhedron meet at angle θ, and the planes perpendicular to these edges

HISTORICAL NOTES: The elegant insight above is usually attributed to Hilbert, appearing3 in
the timeless masterpiece, Geometry and the Imagination (Hilbert 1952, p. 195), the German original
having appeared in 1932. But in fact4 the same observation was made in 1854 by the great British
physicist James Clerk Maxwell, 78 years prior to Hilbert. Maxwell’s original 1854 letter to William
Thomson can be found in Maxwell (2002, Vol. 1, p. 243), and his eventual paper of 1856 appears
in Maxwell (2003, Vol. 1, §4).
Finally, we note that these concepts can be extended to nonconvex polyhedra and to ver-
tices having negative curvature. For a beautiful and completely general investigation, see Banchoff
(1970).
3However, Hilbert does not invoke our rocking plane. Instead, his justiﬁcation for the transition from the nj to Pm consists
only in this: “In order to relate this to the spherical representation of surfaces, we connect the points [nj] . . . by arcs of great
circles . . . [to create Pm]”
4I stumbled upon this little-known fact entirely by accident while leaﬁng through my copy of Maxwell’s collected works
(Maxwell 2003), in search of something quite unrelated.

Chapter 15
The Shape Operator
15.1
Directional Derivatives
The Gaussian curvature K, viewed extrinsically, measures the variation of the surface normal n
in the vicinity of a point p, but only in a blurred, average way. Instead of looking at the overall
spread of directions of n over a small patch of the surface S containing p, we now turn to a more
precise method of quantifying the variation of n, by looking at how fast it changes as we move
away from p within S in a speciﬁc direction.
Let bv be a unit vector emanating from p and lying within the tangent plane Tp to S at p.
See [15.1]. We would like to deﬁne the rate of change of n in the direction bv. If we move a small
distance ϵ away from p in this direction then we arrive at a point q whose position vector is
therefore q = p + ϵbv. It is then tempting to try to deﬁne the rate of change of n as
lim
ϵ→0
n(q) −n(p)
ϵ
.
But this will not do. For q actually resides within Tp, not S, and therefore n(q) is not even deﬁned.
Nevertheless, it seems clear that the concept we are groping for really is well-deﬁned: we
need only move a distance ϵ within the surface, instead of the tangent plane, but we must do so
in the desired direction bv. One way of achieving this end is to drop a perpendicular from q to S,
meeting it at r, say. It seems clear (and can be proved) that the length pr of the geodesic segment
from p to r is ultimately equal to ϵ:
pr ≍ϵ.
Returning to our abortive deﬁnition of rate of change, we can now deﬁne
δn ≡n(r) −n(p)
to be the change in n that results from moving distance ϵ (ultimately) within the surface in the
direction bv. Since n has unit length, it merely rotates slightly as we move from p to r. Therefore,
if we picture both n(p) and n(r) as having a common origin, as illustrated in [15.2], then the
movement of its tip is ultimately orthogonal to n, and therefore δn is a vector that ultimately lies
within the tangent plane, Tp.
Finally, the directional derivative ∇bv of n along bv can then be deﬁned as
∇bvn ≡lim
ϵ→0
δn
ϵ .
(15.1)
As we have explained, this derivative lives in Tp.
This is the directional derivative per unit length. If instead we want the derivative along a
general tangent vector v = v bv of length v, then we must simply scale up by this length:
∇vn = ∇vbvn = v∇bvn.

normal changes from the tail to the tip of v. This change δn ≍−S(v) ultimately lies in the parallel tangent plane
to S2 at n(p). Superimposing the two tangent planes, S may be viewed as a linear transformation of Tp to itself,
here depicted detached from S, ﬂoating between the two surfaces.

This makes greater intuitive sense if we think of v as the velocity of a particle moving over the
surface, at the moment it passes through p. Then a unit vector bv corresponds to a particle moving
at unit speed. Thus when ∇bv is applied to any quantity deﬁned along the particle’s trajectory (not
necessarily n) it yields the rate of change of that quantity with respect to time. Thus if the particle
were to travel three times as fast along the same trajectory, changing bv to 3bv, then the quantity
would change three times as fast along the trajectory. This is one way of looking at (15.2). Note
that this concept of the directional derivative can be applied to any quantity (vector or scalar) that
is deﬁned on the surface, or merely along the trajectory.
There is another way of looking at the deﬁnition of the directional derivative that requires,
ﬁrst, that we extend the concept of “ultimate equality” to vectors. Thus, suppose that two vectors
a and b depend on a small quantity ϵ that tends to zero. An obvious deﬁnition of a ≍b would
be that each component of a is ultimately equal to the corresponding component of b. But this
deﬁnition is problematic [why?] if one or more components is identically zero. Therefore, instead,
we adopt the following more satisfactory and geometrical deﬁnition, namely, that the magnitudes
and directions of the two vectors are ultimately equal:
If two vectors a and b depend on a small quantity ϵ that tends to zero, we deﬁne
them to be ultimately equal, written a ≍b, iff |a| ≍|b| and the angle between
their directions has vanishing limit.
Granted this, we may now rewrite (15.1) as
∇bvn ≍δn
ϵ
⇐⇒
δn ≍ϵ∇bvn = ∇ϵbvn.
Here, then, is the resulting point of view, which we shall employ repeatedly throughout the
remainder of the book:
In the limit of vanishing ϵ, and hence vanishing v = ϵ bv, ∇vn is ultimately
equal to the change δn in n from the tail to the tip of v: ∇vn ≍δn.
(15.3)
Of course, as noted earlier, this statement employs a touch of poetic license, for the tip of v
does not actually reside within S. But as ϵ tends to zero, so does the amount of poetic license
required! For, in this limit, the distinction between q and r in [15.1] rapidly becomes insigniﬁcant.
15.2
The Shape Operator S
The Shape Operator1 S associated with the surface at the point p tells us how the normal vector
changes (in which direction it tips, and how fast) as we move away from p along an arbitrary
tangent vector v, which is no longer necessarily short, but rather has arbitrary length v. More
precisely, it is simply deﬁned to be the negative of the directional derivative of n along v:
S(v) ≡−∇vn.
(15.4)
1There are two other mathematical objects that encode exactly the same information as the Shape Operator: the Second
Fundamental Form and the Weingarten map. We shall not employ either in this book.

Chapter 15 The Shape Operator
The insertion of the minus sign into the deﬁnition is standard; as we shall see shortly, it is
motivated by our earlier deﬁnition of the sign of the curvature of normal sections.
The surface S and the sphere S2 have the same normal vector n(p) at p and n(p), respectively.
Thus their tangent planes Tp and Tn(p) at these two points are parallel, and we may imagine
transporting them so as to make them coincide. Thus any tangent vector to S2 emanating from
n(p) may instead be pictured as residing in Tp, emanating from p. In [15.2] we picture these two
coincident planes ﬂoating between the two surfaces.
The meaning of the Shape Operator now becomes especially clear if we think of a point r very
close to p being carried by the spherical map to a point n(r) on S2 close to n(p). See [15.2]. If v is
the very short vector connecting p to r and δn is the corresponding vector connecting n(p) to n(r)
then, by virtue of (15.3),
S(v) ≍−δn.
If we think of p as the origin of these two coincident planes, then S is in fact a linear trans-
formation of Tp to itself. That is, if v and w are arbitrary tangent vectors at p, and a and b are
arbitrary constants, then
S(av + bw)
=
−(∇av+bw) n
=
−∇avn −∇bw n
=
−a∇vn −b∇w n
=
a S(v) + b S(w).
Recall from Linear Algebra that this means that S can be represented as a rectangular array
of numbers [S], called the matrix of S. In general, the j-th column of the matrix is the image of the
j-th basis vector, or rather the numerical components of that vector. In our 2-dimensional case, this
means that [S] is a 2 × 2 square.
Later in this chapter we shall investigate the matrix [S], but for now we illustrate this gen-
eral idea of “matrixiﬁcation” with an example we will need momentarily, namely, the matrix [Rθ]
representing a rotation Rθ of the plane through angle θ about the origin.
Figure [15.3] illustrates the effect of Rθ on the basis vectors, from which we immediately
deduce that
[Rθ] =

where c ≡cos θ and s ≡sin θ.

The Geometric Effect of S
Let e1 and e2 be unit vectors along the (orthogonal) ﬁrst and second principal directions, respec-
tively. What is the geometric effect of S on vectors in Tp when referred to this special orthonormal
basis {e1, e2}? Our earlier result (12.7) provides the neat answer:
The principal directions are the eigenvectors of the Shape Operator S, and the
principal curvatures are the corresponding eigenvalues:
S(ei) = κiei.

[15.3] The ﬁrst/second column of the matrix [Rθ] is the image of the ﬁrst/second basis vector when it is rotated

NOTE: It was precisely in order to cancel out the minus sign in (12.7) that a minus sign was
introduced into the deﬁnition (15.4) of S.
Thus, knowing that the effect of S on the principal directions is to stretch them by their respec-
tive principal curvatures, linearity now reveals that the effect of S on a general tangent vector is to
stretch it by these two factors in these two perpendicular directions.
If we choose our basis vectors to be {e1, e2}, then it follows that the matrix of S takes the
especially simple, diagonal form,
[S] =

(15.7)
Recall that a linear transformation expands the area of every shape by the same factor. This
universal area expansion factor is the determinant of its matrix. This is particularly clear in the
present case, where a unit square aligned with the principal axes is stretched into a rectangle
of sides κ1 and κ2, and therefore the original square of unit area undergoes an expansion to area
|[S]| = κ1κ2, so this is the expansion factor for all areas. Once again we recover our familiar
expression for the extrinsic version of the Gaussian curvature:
Kext = area expansion factor of the Shape Operator = |[S]| = κ1κ2.
(15.8)
Recall that when we ﬁrst derived this result (see (12.8), p. 134) we did so by considering the
area expansion of one particular shape, and we merely claimed that the result was independent of
this choice; the recognition of the Shape Operator’s linearity has now proved that claim. Further-
more, given its geometric meaning, this area expansion factor (i.e., the determinant) must have
the same value in all coordinate systems.
Notice that this matrix [S] is symmetric (also called self-adjoint), meaning that it has mirror
symmetry across its main diagonal, which runs top-left to bottom-right. Since reﬂection across this
diagonal is achieved by swapping rows and columns, which creates (by deﬁnition) the transpose
[S]T , this symmetry can be written,
[S]T = [S].
(15.9)
The symmetry (15.9) of the matrix [S] is no accident, but rather reﬂects (pardon the pun!) the
underlying symmetry of the linear transformation S itself, and it will persist even if the basis is
not aligned with the principal directions, in which case [S] will no longer be diagonal.

DETOUR: The Geometry of the Singular Value Decomposition
and of the Transpose
In this optional detour we seek to clarify the symmetry (15.9) of the Shape Operator by ﬁrst asking
the following question: If a general linear transformation M is represented by the matrix [M], what
transformation MT is represented by the transpose matrix [M]T ? In order to answer this question,
we shall begin by providing a geometric interpretation and derivation of one of the most crucial
results in all of Linear Algebra, the so-called Singular Value Decomposition2—or SVD for short.
The geometric interpretations and proofs we shall now present would appear to be appro-
priate for a ﬁrst course in Linear Algebra. Yet, surprisingly, we have not been able to ﬁnd these
ideas described in any standard introductory text; indeed, we suspect that many working mathe-
maticians may also be unfamiliar with them. Nevertheless, if you are in a hurry to proceed with
Differential Geometry, please feel free to skip to the next section.
We begin by recalling the familiar fact that if a linear transformation of the plane has two
real eigenvalues, its geometric effect is easily visualized, as follows: stretch by these factors along
the two (typically nonorthogonal) eigenvector directions. But what if the transformation does not
have real eigenvalues? A simple example of such a transformation (i.e., one that does not preserve
any direction) is a rotation, but at least this too enjoys the virtue of being easily visualized. But
how shall we make geometric sense of a general linear transformation that does not preserve any
direction?
The SVD provides a wonderfully simple and vivid answer to this question, and it applies to
all linear transformations; therefore even the transformations we thought we already understood
(the ones that stretch in two nonorthogonal eigenvector directions) thereby receive new meaning.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Every linear transformation of the
plane is equivalent to stretching in two orthogonal directions (by generally dif-
ferent factors, σ1 and σ2, called the singular values), followed by a rotation
through angle τ, which we call the twist.
(15.10)
To understand this, consider the top half of [15.4], which shows the effect (from left to right)
of a general linear transformation on an origin-centred circle C. Since the Cartesian equation of C
is quadratic, the linear change of coordinates induced by the transformation will lead to another
quadratic equation for the image curve. The image curve eC is thus a conic section, and since the
ﬁnite points of C are not sent to inﬁnity, this conic must be an ellipse, shown top right of [15.4].
We have just used an algebraic statement of linearity; next we use the fundamental geometric
fact is that it makes no difference if we add two vectors and then map the result, or if we map the
vectors ﬁrst and then add them. Convince yourself of these two simple consequences:
•
Parallel lines map to parallel lines.
•
The midpoint of a line segment maps to the midpoint of the image line segment.
We now apply3 these facts to eC.
Since all the diameters of C are bisected by the centre of C, it follows that the image chords of
eC must all pass through a common point of bisection. Thus the centre of the circle C is mapped to
the centre of the ellipse eC.
2As we have noted and have sought to correct, Beltrami’s name is not currently attached to his models of the hyperbolic plane.
To add insult to injury, the average “mathematician in the street” is also unaware of the fact that it was the very same Eugenio
Beltrami who ﬁrst discovered the SVD! See Stewart (1993).

[15.4] Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): The top half of the ﬁgure illustrates the effect, from left to right, of a
general linear transformation M on an origin-centred circle. Preservation of midpoints enables us to prove that M
is equivalent to two perpendicular stretches (by the “singular values” σ1 and σ2), followed by a rotation, which
we call the twist ≡τ; here τ = φ −θ. The bottom half of the ﬁgure demonstrates that this SVD is equivalent to
being able to write M = Rφ ◦Σ ◦R−θ, where Σ stretches horizontally by σ1 and vertically by σ2.
Drawn in the same heavy line as its image is the particular diameter d of the circle that is
mapped to the major axis ed of the ellipse. Now consider the chords (shown dashed) of C that
are perpendicular to d. Since these are all bisected by d, their images must be a family of parallel
chords of eC such that ed is their common bisector. They must therefore be the family perpendicular
to ed. (Convince yourself of this by drawing a family of parallel chords of eC in a general direction.)
It is now clear that the linear transformation is a stretch in the direction of d, another stretch
perpendicular to it, and ﬁnally a twist, thereby conﬁrming the existence of the SVD. Note that we
could equally well do the orthogonal stretchings after the twist, instead of before. But in that case
the stretchings would be in the new, twisted directions, along ed, and orthogonal to it.
The bottom half of the ﬁgure demonstrates that the SVD is equivalent to being able to write
M = Rφ ◦Σ ◦R−θ,
(15.11)
where Σ stretches horizontally by σ1 and vertically by σ2.
Note that this result also makes sense at the level of counting degrees of freedom. Just as
the matrix has four independent entries, so the speciﬁcation of our transformation also requires

156
•
Chapter 15 The Shape Operator
four bits of geometric information: the direction of d, the stretch factor in this direction, the per-
pendicular stretch factor, and the twist.
A vitally important special case arises if we require that the two stretch factors be set to be
equal: σ1 = σ2 = a, say, in which case the image of a circle is another circle that is a times as big.
This apparently reduces the number of degrees of freedom from four to three. However, since
we are now producing an equal expansion in all directions, the direction chosen for d becomes
irrelevant, and we are thus left with only two genuine degrees of freedom: the expansion factor a,
and the twist τ.
In VCA we sought to exploit geometrically the fact that that the local effect of a differen-
tiable function f(z) of a complex variable is precisely a mapping of the type just described. In this
context, a(z) and τ(z) both typically vary with position: they describe the expansion and rotation
undergone by an inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of z.
More explicitly, recapping (4.18), page 42, every tiny complex arrow δz emanating from z is
“amplitwisted” to an image arrow δez emanating from ez = f(z), where δez ≍[aeiτ] δz. In VCA we
called a(z) the ampliﬁcation of f(z), and we called the combined effect of the local ampliﬁcation
and twist the amplitwist of f(z), encoded as a complex number:
f′(z) = amplitwist of f(z) = (ampliﬁcation) ei(twist) = aeiτ.
Let us now resume our quest for the meaning of MT . To facilitate this quest, ﬁrst consider the
inverse of the original linear transformation M (see the top of [15.4]). This inverse M−1 is drawn
going from right to left in [15.5a]: ﬁrst it undoes the twist τ of M by twisting −τ, and then it undoes
the stretchings of M by squashing by 1/σ1 and 1/σ2 in the same two orthogonal directions that M
originally did stretching.
Reversing the arrows in the bottom half of [15.4], we can also express
this as
M−1 = Rθ ◦Σ−1 ◦R−φ.
At last we can reveal the geometric meaning of MT . We shall assume that the reader is famil-
iar with the algebraic properties of the transpose operation on matrices, and we shall use them to
expose the underlying geometry. First note that taking the transpose of a rotation matrix (15.5)
yields the opposite rotation: [Rθ]T = [R−θ]. Also, recall that ([P][Q])T = [Q]T [P]T . Thus (15.11)
yields,
MT = (Rφ ◦Σ ◦R−θ)T = RT
−θ ◦ΣT ◦RT
φ = Rθ ◦Σ ◦R−φ,
and [15.5b] illustrates the meaning of this:
The linear transformation MT does the the opposite twist to M, followed by the
same two orthogonal expansions as M.
(15.12)
Having grasped the geometric meaning of MT , the geometric meaning of symmetry suddenly
becomes clear, too:
The linear transformation M is symmetric (i.e. MT = M) iff the twist vanishes.
But if τ = 0, then the orthogonal expansion directions become eigenvectors, so we
also conclude M is symmetric iff it has orthogonal eigenvectors.

[15.5] [a] The inverse M−1 (going from right to left) of the original linear transformation at the top of [15.4]:
it undoes M by ﬁrst doing the opposite twist −τ, and then squashing by 1/σ1 and 1/σ2 in the same two
orthogonal directions that M originally did stretching. [b] The transpose MT also starts by twisting −τ, but then
it does the same two orthogonal stretches that M did.
If τ = φ −θ = 0, the two rotations in the bottom half of [15.4] are equal and opposite, and so (15.11)
specializes:
If MT = M then M = Rθ ◦Σ ◦R−θ,
(15.14)
which is sometimes called the Spectral Theorem.
We could, instead, have taken (15.12) as our deﬁnition of MT , and then all the algebraic prop-
erties of the transpose would have become readily visualizable geometric theorems. For example,
check that RT
θ = R−θ, which then implies [Rθ]T = [R−θ]. Likewise, check that (P ◦Q)T = QT ◦PT ,
which then implies ([P][Q])T = [Q]T [P]T .
Here is a fresh example of a result conventionally proved by calculation and now rendered
transparent by geometry: MT expands area by the same factor as M:
|MT | = σ1σ2 = |M|.

158
•
Chapter 15 The Shape Operator
And here is yet another result that is proved algebraically in every standard text, but which
geometry now allows us to understand. If we ﬁrst do M (top of [15.4]) and then do MT ([15.5b])
then the opposite twists cancel, and we literally see that
The transformation (MT ◦M) is symmetric, having orthogonal eigenvectors
(along d and perpendicular to it) with eigenvalues σ2
1 and σ2
2.
(15.15)
Lastly, we mention another commonly used manifestation of symmetry, leaving it to you to
verify this both algebraically and geometrically:
A linear transformation M is symmetric (i.e., MT = M) iff
a·M(b) = b·M(a),
for all a and b.
(15.16)
Armed with the geometric meaning of the transpose, Exercise 12 provides eight more exam-
ples of what we might call “Visual Linear Algebra.” These examples underscore our overarching
philosophy: direct, geometric reasoning frequently allows us to completely bypass symbolic
manipulation to obtain an intuitive, visual grasp of mathematical reality.
15.5
The General Matrix of S
The Shape Operator S is a geometric entity, independent of any particular choice of basis vectors.
But the matrix [S] that represents S certainly does depend on this choice.
Suppose that we choose an arbitrary orthonormal basis {E1, E2}, without ﬁrst ﬁnding the
principal directions and curvatures; how will the matrix look? While we may not yet know the
principal directions, they certainly exist, so let us suppose that {e1, e2} are obtained by rotating
{E1, E2} through some unknown angle θ. Figure [15.6] illustrates this in a case where κ1 > κ2 > 0.
On the left, we see the effect of S on the unit circle, which is carried into an ellipse with semimajor
axis κ1 aligned with e1, and semiminor axis κ2 aligned with e2.
As we see on the right, in terms of {E1, E2} the effect of S is equivalent to the following three
successive transformations:
S = (rotate by −θ) then (expand by κ1,2 along E1,2) then (rotate by θ).
If you read the previous section, this will already be familiar to you as the result (15.14).
Recall from Linear Algebra that the product [B][A] of two matrices is (or at least should be!)
deﬁned to be the matrix of the composite linear transformation: [B][A] ≡[B ◦A]. It follows from

[15.6] On the left, the Shape Operator S stretches the orthogonal principal directions by factors equal to the
principal curvatures, deforming the unit circle into an ellipse aligned with the principal directions. This effect of
S is equivalent to ﬁrst rotating by −θ, producing the ﬁgure on the right, then stretching horizontally by κ1 and
vertically by κ2, then rotating back by θ.
At least one of these four entries should look familiar. Let κ(E1) denote the curvature of
the normal section of S taken in the E1 direction, which makes angle −θ with the ﬁrst principal
direction. Then Euler’s formula (10.1) informs us that the top-left entry is κ1c2 + κ2s2 = κ(E1).
But why has this simpliﬁcation occurred?
15.6
Geometric Interpretation of S and Simpliﬁcation of [S]
The answer sheds new light on the meaning of the Shape Operator:
If bv is an arbitrary unit tangent vector, then the curvature κ(bv) of the normal
section in this direction is given by κ(bv) = bv·S(bv). Thus,
κ(bv) = Projection of S(bv) onto the direction of bv.
(15.18)
(NOTE: By Meusnier’s Theorem (11.4), κ(bv) is not merely the curvature of the normal section, it is
also equal to the previously introduced normal curvature κn(bv) of any curve on the surface that
passes through this point travelling in the direction bv.)
This interpretation is illustrated in [15.7]. Note in particular that this construction correctly
yields κ(e1) = κ1 and κ(e2) = κ2.
The essential geometric explanation for this is the same as that shown in [8.5], on page 102. In
fact we previously proved the result in the form (11.5), but we repeat the proof here to illustrate
our new notation. Thinking of bv as the velocity of a particle travelling along the normal section at
unit speed, so that ∇bvbv = κ(bv) n is its acceleration towards the centre of curvature, we ﬁnd
0 = ∇bv(bv·n) = bv·∇bvn + n·∇bvbv = −bv·S(bv) + κ(bv),
from which the result (15.18) follows immediately.
We can give an alternative derivation if we assume Euler’s formula, (10.1). Currently we are
using θ to denote the angle from E1 to e1, so, to avoid confusion with our earlier discussion of

[15.7] The curvature of a normal section of a surface taken in the direction of a general unit tangent vector bv is
given by κ(bv) = projection of S(bv) onto the direction of bv.
Euler’s formula, let us instead use α to denote the angle that a general bv makes with e1, so that
Euler’s formula now reads
κ(bv) = κ1 cos2 α + κ2 sin2 α.
Since (15.18) is a purely geometric statement, as witnessed in [15.7], it is sufﬁcient to demonstrate
its truth any particular basis. And in the principal basis {e1, e2} a simple coordinate calculation
conﬁrms the result:
bv·S(bv) =

Armed with the result (15.18), we may now return to the interpretation and simpliﬁcation of
(15.17). Recall that even if S were an arbitrary linear transformation, the j-th column of its matrix
would be the image of the j-th basis vector, so the ﬁrst column of [S] is the vector S(E1), and
therefore its projections along {E1, E2} (i.e., its components) are the dot products of this vector
with these basis vectors. Likewise, this is true for the second column of [S], so
[S] =
"
E1·S(E1)
E1·S(E2)
E2·S(E1)
E2·S(E2)
#
.
(15.19)
Thus (15.18) explains4 why the top-left entry of (15.17) turned out to be κ(E1). Now look at the
other diagonal entry. Whether we use Euler’s formula [exercise] or refer to (15.18) and (15.19), we
see that the bottom-right entry of (15.17) is κ1s2 + κ2c2 = κ(E2). If you read the previous (optional)
section, also note that (15.16) shows that the symmetry of [S] now follows from the symmetry of
S, for E1·S(E2) = E2·S(E1).
Before we do any more computation, let us pause to discuss more explicitly the geometric
meaning of the entries in (15.19). As we have said, the ﬁrst column is S(E1) = −∇E1n, which mea-
sures how the normal turns as we move off in the E1 direction. Let Π1 be the normal plane in this
direction, i.e., the plane spanned by E1 and n. See [12.5b] on page 133 for a concrete example. Then
4Turning this around, we have obtained another derivation of Euler’s formula.

15.7 [S] Is Completely Determined by Three Curvatures
•
161
the ﬁrst component of S(E1), namely E1·S(E1), measures how fast n tips towards E1 within Π1 as
we begin to move along E1; this is determined by the curvature of the normal section, indeed it
is the curvature κ(E1). The second component of S(E1), namely E2·S(E1), measures how fast n
rotates perpendicularly to the direction of motion, i.e., how fast it rotates out of Π1.
Of course the meaning of the second column S(E2) is completely analogous. The ﬁrst compo-
nent E1·S(E2) measures how fast n rotates out of Π2 as we begin to move along E2. The second
component E2·S(E2), measures how fast n rotates within Π2, and this is κ(E2).
The κ-related tipping within Π, and the rotation out of Π, are both clearly visible for the typical
direction shown in [12.5b]. If, however, we move off in a principal direction then all of the tipping
is in the direction of motion, within Π, and there is no initial rotation out of Π, and this is what we
see in [12.5a].
Let us look more closely at the off-diagonal term, which measures how fast n swings out
of Π1,2. If we once again let ∆κ = (κ1 −κ2), as in (10.2), then the matrix representing the Shape
Operator in a general basis {E1, E2} is given by
[S] =
"
κ(E1)
∆κ
2 sin 2θ
∆κ
2 sin 2θ
κ(E2)
#
(15.20)
Note that this general matrix is indeed symmetric, as demanded by (15.9): [S]T = [S]. Also note
that if the basis coincides with the principal basis, so that θ = 0, then (15.20) reduces to the diagonal
form (15.7), as it should. The general matrix also reduces to this diagonal form if θ = (π/2), for in
that case the basis is again aligned with the principal basis, only now {E1, E2} = {−e2, e1}. On the
other hand, the off-diagonal term is greatest (n swings out of Π1,2 the fastest) when θ = (π/4), in
which case Π1,2 bisect the principal directions.
15.7
[S] Is Completely Determined by Three Curvatures
Next, observe that the two equal off-diagonal entries are simply the oscillating term in Euler’s
formula, (10.2), phase-shifted by ±(π/4). Indeed, this formula tells us that the curvature of the
normal section in the direction E1 + E2, bisecting the angle between the basis vectors, is given by
κ(E1 + E2) = κ( π
4 −θ) = κ + ∆κ
2 sin 2θ.
(15.21)
Of course we could equally well work with the orthogonal direction:
κ(E1 −E2) = κ(θ −π

But, choosing (somewhat arbitrarily) to use the ﬁrst direction, (15.20) may be written
[S] =
"
κ(E1)
κ(E1 + E2) −κ
κ(E1 + E2) −κ
κ(E2)
#
.
(15.23)
It might seem at ﬁrst that we still need to know κ1,2 (or at least their sum) in order to calculate
κ. But in fact we do not, and we shall instead see that the Shape Operator matrix can be expressed
purely in terms of the curvatures of the normal sections in three directions: E1, E2, and (E1 + E2).
Recall that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, so for the original diagonal
matrix (15.7) the trace is Tr [S] = κ1 + κ2 = 2κ. But we know from Linear Algebra that if [A] and [B]
are the matrices of any two linear transformation of the plane, then Tr [A][B] = Tr [B][A]. Thus,
Tr [Rθ][A][R−θ] = Tr [A][R−θ][Rθ] = Tr [A],

Chapter 15 The Shape Operator
in other words,
The trace of any linear transformation is invariant under rotation of the basis vectors.
(15.24)
(There is actually a geometric reason for this; see Arnol’d (1973, §16.3).)
Therefore, returning to the case at hand, in which [A] = [S], we deduce that even in the case of
a general basis, with the matrix (15.23),
κ(E1) + κ(E2) = Tr [S] = κ1 + κ2 = 2 κ.
In fact we need not even appeal to the general theorem of Linear Algebra to see this, for in our
case we have already explicitly calculated [S], and the truth of our assertion follows immediately
from (15.17). Another speciﬁc example is obtained by adding (15.21) and (15.22).
Putting this into words, we have a result of interest in its own right:
The sum of the curvatures in any two perpendicular directions is equal to the sum
of the principal curvatures.
Thus, as claimed, the matrix (15.23) does indeed only depend on the curvatures in three direc-
tions, for κ = 1
2[κ(E1) + κ(E2)], obviating the need to know the principal curvatures. Therefore,
as claimed, the general matrix (15.23) of the Shape Operator can be written explicitly in terms of
these three curvatures:
[S] =


κ(E1)
κ(E1 + E2) −1
2[κ(E1) + κ(E2)]
κ(E1 + E2) −1
2[κ(E1) + κ(E2)]
κ(E2)

.
Finally, recall from (15.8) that the extrinsic version Kext of the Gaussian curvature is the
determinant of any of these forms of the matrix of [S]. For example, (15.23) yields
Kext = |[S]| = κ(E1)κ(E2) −[κ(E1 + E2) −κ]2 .
15.8
Asymptotic Directions
Recall that Dupin’s indicatrix D (p. 111) arises from the intersection of the surface with a plane
Tp(ϵ) parallel to the tangent plane Tp and distance ϵ away from it, so Tp(0) = Tp. As ϵ increases
from 0 and Tp(ϵ) just begins to move away in the normal direction, D is the nascent conic section
of intersection with the surface.
If K(p) > 0 then D is an ellipse, and p is called elliptic; if K(p) = 0 then D is a parabola, and p
is called parabolic; if K(p) < 0 then D is a hyperbola, and p is called hyperbolic.
Here we shall focus on the hyperbolic (negative curvature) case, and shall investigate the
directions of the asymptotes of the hyperbola D, which are called the asymptotic directions. As
we shall now explain, the asymptotic directions have a simple geometric relationship to the Shape
Operator S.
As discussed in the previous chapter, if the (x, y)-axes are aligned with the principal direc-
tions, the equation of the pair of conjugate hyperbolas D is
κ1x2 + κ2y2 = ±1,
the sign being determined by the sign of ϵ, i.e., whether we move the tangent plane up or
down. The symmetry axes (in both the elliptic and hyperbolic cases) coincide with the principal/

directions.
Let κ1 = p2 and κ2 = −q2 (with p and q positive) and let us choose the plus in the above equa-
tion for D. Then,

Thus the asymptotes have equations y = ± p

C, and its elliptical image S(C), to help visualize the effect of the mapping S, which stretches hor-
izontally and vertically, and ﬂips across the x-axis. Thus the vectors in the asymptotic directions,
and their images under S, are given by,
a± ∝

As illustrated in [15.8], this means that athough S maps a principal direction to the same direction,
The Shape Operator maps an asymptotic direction to an orthogonal direction:
a±·S(a±) = 0.
(15.25)
In fact, as we see in [15.8], S turns the two asymptotic directions in opposite senses, a+ by −π

and a−by + π
2 .
But why has this happened? We have pictured D as the magniﬁed intersection curve of the
surface with Tp(ϵ) just as ϵ increases from 0. But, initially, when ϵ = 0 this hyperbola of inter-
section degenerates into the asymptotes themselves. Since this intersection curve (with directions
a±) lies in the tangent plane, it has vanishing normal curvature, so it follows from the geometric
interpretation (15.18) of the Shape Operator that

164

Chapter 15 The Shape Operator
κ(ba±) =ba±·S(ba±) = 0,
thereby explaining the result.
In light of this connection with the normal curvature, the deﬁnition of asymptotic direction
has been generalized to mean any direction for which the normal curvature vanishes. Thus a
parabolic point also has one “asymptotic direction” [exercise: what is it?] despite the fact that the
parabola D does not have any asymptotes.
If we choose E1 to be either one of the asymptotic directions, so that Π1 is the normal plane in
this direction, then as we move off within the surface along E1, the normal n must rotate about E1,
swinging straight out of Π1, its head moving in a direction tangent to the surface and perpendic-
ular to E1, i.e., in the direction ±E2. Thus S(E1) = ±τ E2, where τ is the rate of spinning of n about
E1, the so-called torsion5 introduced on page 106. It follows from (15.19) that
At a hyperbolic point, the curvature of the surface can be expressed in terms
of the torsion τ of an asymptotic curve as
Kext = |[S]| = −τ2.
(15.26)
According to Stoker (1969, p. 101), this result is due to Beltrami and to Enneper.

Classical Terminology and Notation:
The Three Fundamental Forms
When consulting older, classical works on Differential Geometry, you will encounter terms and
notation that we do not employ in this book. In particular, you will certainly meet the three so-
called Fundamental Forms, denoted I, II, and III.
All three Fundamental Forms are symmetric functions of pairs of tangent vectors, u and v.
First Fundamental Form:
I(u, v)
≡
u·v.
Second Fundamental Form:
II(u, v)
≡
S(u)·v.
Third Fundamental Form:
III(u, v)
≡
S(u)·S(v).
The Shape Operator itself does not appear in the classical literature6; its mathematical content
is instead represented by the Second Fundamental Form. For example, the curvature of the normal
section in the direction bv, given by (15.18), would, in yesteryears, have been written, κ(bv) = II(bv, bv).
WARNING: Although we shall not introduce and deﬁne Differential Forms (Forms for short)
until Act V, we should immediately caution the reader that the three classical “Forms” are not
Forms at all! While we certainly do not fault modern authors who continue to speak the classical
language, our reliance on genuine Forms impelled us to turn the classical language into a dead
language!
5We hope no confusion arises here from the letter τ serving double duty: we also recently used it to denote the (unrelated)
“twist” of an SVD decomposition.
6The Shape Operator was ﬁrst seriously championed, and brought into common usage, by Barrett O’Neill in his ground-
breaking introductory text (O’Neill 2006) the ﬁrst edition of which appeared in 1966.

Chapter 16
Introduction to the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
16.1
Some Topology and the Statement of the Result
The Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful results
in all of mathematics. Furthermore, it is also fundamental, having spawned the discovery of ever-
more powerful generalizations, the culmination of which is perhaps (for now) the Atiyah–Singer
Index Theorem, discovered in 1963. This Theorem, in turn, caused seismic shifts in other areas of
mathematics and in theoretical physics. These subsequent developments are far beyond the scope
of the present work, and sadly beyond the competence of the present author, but the statement of
the original form of GGB (as we shall henceforth abbreviate it) is surprisingly simple and easily
understood. We need just a few preliminaries before we can state the result.
First, the total curvature K(P) of a region P of a curved surface is deﬁned (naturally enough)
to be,
K(P) ≡
∫∫
P
K dA.
(NOTE: Even in modern times, this concept is occasionally still referred to by its old Latin name,
Curvatura Integra.) For example, if P is a ﬂat piece of paper with an arbitrary simple curve as
boundary, then K(P) = 0. If we now bend the paper into a different shape eP (without stretching it),
say, into a portion of a cylinder or cone, then K(eP) = 0, by virtue of the Theorema Egregium.
But now suppose instead that P is made of a highly stretchable material, like rubber. If we
stretch P over the surface of a sphere, then K(eP) > 0. Indeed, by choosing the sphere to be as small
as we please, we can make its curvature as large as we please, and with it K(eP) becomes as large
as we please. If we instead stretch R into the form of a portion of a pseudosphere, then K(eP) < 0,
and again this can be made as negative as we please.
Such a continuous, one-to-one stretching, P 7→eP, which does not preserve lengths or even
angles, is called a topological mapping or topological transformation, or homeomorphism. Just
as ancient Greek geometry sought out properties of ﬁgures that are invariant under rigid, distance-
preserving mappings, so in the nineteenth century a new area of mathematics arose, called
topology, wherein properties were sought that were invariant under topological transformations.
Clearly, the concept of curvature does not belong to topology: stretching the surface in the
vicinity of a point p changes the value of K(p). Indeed, we have just seen that K(ep) can be made to
take on any value we please, either positive or negative. And likewise the more primitive concepts
of length and angle do not belong to topology. Thus, at ﬁrst sight, it might appear that topology
would be a rather trivial or barren area of study: how can anything interesting or subtle survive
the arbitrarily complicated and extreme distortions of a topological mapping?!
Remarkably, nothing could be further from the truth. Out of the kindling embrace of its
principal parents (Riemann and Poincaré), topology rapidly grew up to become a powerful yet
beneﬁcent Hydra, explaining and unifying phenomena in disparate and distant realms of thought.
In order to introduce our ﬁrst topological invariant, we restrict our attention to closed surfaces
that are also orientable. Any such surface may be pictured as the boundary of a solid object in R3.
Such a surface is automatically orientable, meaning that one may consistently decide which of the

its starting point as −n.
two opposite choices of n is the normal to the surface—let it point out of the solid object into empty
space.
But isn’t every surface orientable? No! As Möbius and Listing independently discovered in
1858, taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then gluing the ends of the strip together
to form a loop, produces a surface with only one side! As illustrated in [16.1], starting with an
arbitrary initial choice of n, then continuously carrying n along a full circuit of the centre line, we
return it to its starting point as −n. Thus this so-called Möbius band1 is nonorientable.
Returning to ordinary, orientable, closed surfaces, the fundamental feature that topologically
distinguishes one from another is the number of holes it contains. This is called the genus g of the
surface, and its value is illustrated in [16.2] for a few surfaces. Each pair of surfaces with the same
genus is topologically equivalent, or homeomorphic, meaning that one may be changed into the
other by a topological mapping (aka homeomorphism). But two surfaces of different genus cannot
be topologically equivalent, since g is invariant under topological mappings.
The genus was deﬁned more precisely by Riemann, in 1851,2 as the maximum number of cuts
along closed, nonintersecting loops on the surface that can be performed without splitting the
surface into two disconnected pieces. For example, cutting the sphere along any closed loop will
split it into two, so the genus is zero. On the torus, we can cut along just one loop without splitting
the torus into two pieces: e.g., cut along either an equator that encircles the axis of symmetry, or
along a circle that goes through the hole (whose plane contains the axis of symmetry). But if we
now cut the resulting surface along any loop that avoids the ﬁrst, it will split it into two, so the
genus of the torus is one. Try (in your mind) making loop cuts on a two-holed doughnut, as seen
in [16.2c], and verify that g = 2.
As Möbius realized in 1863, every closed, orientable surface is topologically equivalent to a
g-holed torus. We shall accept such visually plausible statements without proof, but the reader in
search of precise deﬁnitions and proofs should consult the excellent topology texts we recommend
in Further Reading, at the end of this book.

[16.2] Each pair of surfaces is topologically the same, distinguished from the other pairs by its number of holes,
the genus, g. Also shown are the corresponding values of the Euler characteristic, χ = 2 −2g.
We can now state the stunning result:
Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem (GGB). The total curvature of a closed, ori-
entable surface Sg depends only on its topological genus g, and is given by
K(Sg) = 4π (1 −g) = 2π χ(Sg).
(16.1)
Here the quantity
χ(Sg) ≡2 −2g
(16.2)
serves (for now) as merely an alternative means of labelling the surfaces of different genus: see
[16.2] for examples. This quantity χ(Sg) is called the Euler characteristic of the surface; it arises
naturally in many topological results, and actually has a meaning all its own, which will be
explained in Section 18.1.
Pause for a moment to let the surprise and the beauty of the result sink in. If we take any
given Sg (such as a simple doughnut with g = 1) made out of rubber or Play-Doh, then stretch
it, twist it, squeeze it, and deform it in any way we please, every resulting increase in curvature at
one point of the surface must be instantaneously cancelled out by an exactly opposite decrease in curvature
somewhere else on the surface. In the case of a topological doughnut (aka, torus), this total curvature
remains exactly zero throughout our manipulations.

[16.3] As the semicircle C rotates about L through angle φ, its spherical image eC rotates on S2 at the same
rate, generating a lune of equal angle φ. As φ increases to 2π, eC sweeps out the entire surface of S2, so
K(S) = 4π.
16.2
Total Curvature of the Sphere and of the Torus
16.2.1
Total Curvature of the Sphere
If a surface S is topologically equivalent to a sphere (i.e., with g = 0), the prediction of GGB is that
should have total curvature 4π. In the case of a geometric sphere S, this is easily veriﬁed in multiple
ways. We provide three proofs, the last of which will be shown to generalize beyond spheres.
First, each normal section of the sphere of radius R is itself a circle of radius R, i.e., of curvature
(1/R). So K = κ1κ2 = (1/R2), and the total curvature
K(S) =
∫∫
S
K dA =
∫∫
S
1
R2 dA = 1
R2 4πR2 = 4π.
A second, more enlightening explanation is based on [12.2], page 132: if P is a region on S and
eP = n(P) is its spherical image of P, then
K(P) = [area of spherical image of P on S2] = A(eP).
(16.3)
Now, take the image unit sphere S2 to have the same centre as S, then the spherical map becomes
a radial projection, as illustrated in [12.3], page 132. This makes it crystal clear that eS = n(S) = S2,
so (16.3) implies K(S) = A(S2) = 4π.
Third, and ﬁnally, we picture the sphere S as the surface of revolution obtained by rotating a
semicircle C of radius R about the diameter L through its ends, as depicted in [16.3].
Although we may generate the entire sphere by rotating C a full 2π, the ﬁgure depicts the
process partway through, after C has rotated through angle φ, generating a so-called lune.
The key observation is this, and it applies to an arbitrary surface of revolution, generated by
rotating an arbitrary plane curve C about an arbitrary line within its plane:
If a plane curve C and its unit normal vector n are together rotated about an
arbitrary line in the plane of C, then the rotated n is the normal to the surface of
revolution generated by C.

16.2 Total Curvature of the Sphere and of the Torus
•
169
The explanation is readily understood from the special case in the ﬁgure. The tangent plane
to the surface at a typical point p is spanned by the following two directions: (1) the direction of
the rotated C; and (2) the direction in which p moves as it rotates (i.e., perpendicularly to the plane
of C). But n was initially perpendicular to these two directions, so it remains perpendicular to (1)
and (2) as C and n rotate together. Since n is perpendicular to two directions that span the tangent
plane of S, it is the normal to S.
By virtue of (16.3), this immediately implies the following:
Let C be a plane curve, and L be a line in that plane, and let eL be the line through
the centre of S2 that is parallel to L. Then, as C rotates about L, its spherical image
eC = n(C) rotates at the same rate about eL, and the total curvature of the surface
swept out by C is equal to the total (signed) area swept out by eC on S2.
(16.4)
In particular, as illustrated, the spherical image of this lune is simply a lune of equal angle on
S2, and if C sweeps out all of S, then its spherical image sweeps out all of S2, once again conﬁrming
that K(S) = 4π.
n
[16.4] The spherical image of an
American football is the whole of
S2, so K(football) = 4π, in accor-
dance with GGB.
The advantage of this last point of view is that we now
gain our ﬁrst real insight into GGB itself. Consider the Amer-
ican football depicted in [16.4], which is generated by the
rotation of the curve C about the line L. Here we have drawn
the normals at equal angular increments, which makes clear
the variation in curvature: greatest around the poles, and
least around the equator. Nevertheless, since the football is
topologically spherical, the total curvature should be 4π, and
we can now see that is. For the spherical image of C is the
same semicircle eC as before (connecting the poles of S2), and
therefore as C rotates to generate the football, eC rotates to
sweep out all of S2, just as before, so the total curvature of
the football is indeed 4π!
Clearly, the essential point is that spherical image of the
football covers all of S2. In the next chapter we will elaborate
on this idea to produce our ﬁrst (heuristic) proof of GGB.
16.2.2
Total Curvature of the Torus
As we observed in (10.13), page 114, if a section of C is con-
cave away from L, then, as it rotates about L, it generates a
portion of the surface that has negative curvature. In this case,
the area generated by eC on S2 should be subtracted from the
total curvature. We now illustrate this with the torus, which
of course has regions of both positive and negative curvature.
According to GGB, the doughnut (torus) should have vanishing total curvature, and in Exer-
cise 23, page 89, you actually veriﬁed this by brute force, integrating the curvature formula over
the entire surface. We are now in a position to provide a real explanation, in fact establishing a
(superﬁcially) stronger, local (as opposed to global) result.
Suppose we wish to eat only part of the doughnut: we could cut out a wedge—the darkly
shaded region in [16.5]—as one would a wedge of cake, by making two slices through the axis
of symmetry. We will now apply (16.4) to [16.5] to show that this wedge of doughnut must have
vanishing total curvature. The global result then follows by greed: we cut a larger and larger
wedge of doughnut until we eat the whole thing!

[16.5] As the circle C rotates about L through angle φ, its (great circle) spherical image eC rotates on S2 at the
same rate, generating two lunes of angle φ. As we see, the spherical map preserves orientation on the outer half
of the doughnut, and reverses it on the inner half. The total curvature of the wedge of doughnut is the sum of
the equal and opposite (signed) areas of the two lunes, and therefore it vanishes. Thus the total curvature of the
doughnut vanishes, also.
As the circle C rotates about L through angle φ, its (great circle) spherical image eC rotates
on S2 at the same rate, generating two lunes of angle φ. As we see, the spherical map preserves
orientation on the outer half of the doughnut, and reverses it on the inner half. To highlight this
reversal of orientation on the negatively curved inner half of doughnut, we have placed the label
C there, so it is mapped to a backwards eC.
The total curvature of the wedge of doughnut is the sum of the equal and opposite (signed)
areas of the two lunes, and therefore it vanishes. Letting φ increase to 2π, we see that the image of
the outer half of the doughnut completely covers S2 once positively, while the image of the inner
half completely covers S2 once negatively, so that the total is K(whole doughnut) = 4π + (−4π) = 0.
Observe something else. The entire circle at the top of the doughnut (which divides the outer
and inner halves of opposite curvature) is mapped to a single point, namely, the north pole of S2.
Likewise the lowest circle, upon which the doughnut would rest if it were placed on a plate, is
likewise mapped to the south pole. These points of S2, where the two separate layers that cover
S2 join together, are called branch points.
Our next task is to ﬁnd ways of visualizing the total curvature of surfaces that have more than
one hole.
16.3
Seeing K(Sg) via a Thick Pancake
Imagine pouring a very dense pancake batter into a frying pan to make a large, thick pancake.
Before it can start to cook through and set, we quickly take a cylindrical biscuit cutter and remove
g cylindrical discs from the interior of the pancake, leaving g holes. The batter starts to ooze back
into the holes—thereby producing shapes like the inner halves of doughnuts—then starts to cook
and harden, producing a genus g, thick pancake of the form [16.6].
The spherical map sends the entire ﬂat bottom of the pancake to the south pole of S2, and it
likewise sends the ﬂat top of the pancake to the north pole. As expected, these yield no area on
the sphere, so no contribution to the total curvature.
On the other hand, the outer edge of the pancake is like the outer half of a torus, and so its
spherical image covers the entire sphere once, positively, contributing 4π to the total curvature.
But each of the g rims to the holes in the pancake is like the inner half of a torus, so each one

[16.6] Here Sg takes the form of a thick pancake with g holes. The top and bottom are ﬂat, and so contribute no
curvature, but the outer rim has K = +4π, and the rim of each of the g holes has K = −4π. The total curvature
is therefore 4π(1 −g).
has a spherical image that covers the entire sphere once, negatively, contributing −4π to the total
curvature. Thus (16.3) allows us to see3 that
K(Sg) = 4π + (−4π)g = 4π (1 −g) = 2π χ(Sg).
16.4
Seeing K(Sg) via Bagels and Bridges
We now descend momentarily into the ﬁrst person to relate a personal but pertinent anecdote.
One day, while waiting to be served at a bagel shop near my University of San Francisco
campus, I observed that only a half-dozen plain bagels remained in the display case, still joined
together in a neat row in the baking tin—exactly the number I hoped to purchase! While I contin-
ued to wait, I passed the time with two thoughts: (1) A fervent (albeit atheistic) “prayer” that the
three people ahead of me in the queue didn’t like plain bagels and (2) the happy certainty that,
even in the absence of any detailed knowledge of the geometry of the 6-holed object of my desire,
GGB absolutely guaranteed that its total curvature was exactly −20π.
My prayer (1) was granted, and the server gently tore each of the six bagels from the row and
successively dropped them into a brown paper bag, which he then handed to me. As I left the
shop it struck me that while each of the bagels in my bag appeared totally untampered with, their
original collective total curvature of −20π had evaporated to ZERO! Seemingly without leaving
a trace of his crime, the nefarious server had robbed me of all the negative curvature promised to
me by GGB!
Clearly, the only change in the geometry had been right at the very small joins (or bridges,
as we shall call them) between the bagels, where they were torn apart, so these must have been
the culprits for the dramatic −20π curvature heist. Since the six bagels were joined by ﬁve bridges,
each one presumably added 4π when it was torn asunder. In that case, each bridge must have
originally stored −4π of curvature.
We shall now conﬁrm this theory, thereby explaining the mystery, allowing us to see K(Sg) in
a new way (and, incidentally, absolving the server of malfeasance!).
3Although I have never seen this idea written down, I know (via private conversation) that my friend Professor Tom Banchoff
hit upon the same idea, long before I did, right down to thinking in terms of pancakes!

compress
stretch
bridge
wormhole
[16.7] The surface at the top is the inner half of a torus, and has K = −4π. This total curvature is not altered if
the surface is compressed to create a bagel bridge (left), or stretched to create a wormhole (right).
Consider [16.7]. At the top is a surface that looks like the rim of one of the holes in our thick
pancake, though now turned on its side; alternatively, think of the inner half of a torus. As we we
have discussed, its spherical image covers S2 once negatively, so its total curvature is K = −4π.
Now suppose that we dramatically compress this surface horizontally to yield the surface
on the left, resembling a bridge between two joined bagels in the baking tin. If we follow the
evolution of the spherical image as the surface undergoes this compression, we see that as a the
region around the narrow throat of the bridge contracts, its spherical image actually expands.
Nevertheless, while some parts of the spherical image expand and others contract, the compressed
bridge surface, taken as a whole, has the same spherical image as the uncompressed original, and
its total curvature is therefore still K = −4π, as anticipated.
For future use, we also note that, likewise, the total curvature does not change if we instead
stretch the surface to produce the wormhole (as we shall call it) on the right of [16.7]; it too has
K = −4π.
As [16.8] makes clear, the consequence of each bridge having K = −4π is that
K(Sg) = g · K(bagel) + (g −1) · K(bridge) = g · 0 + (g −1) · (−4π) = 4π(1 −g),
in accord with GGB.
PUZZLE: Place three bagels at the vertices of a large triangle, then connect them together with
three wormholes along the edges of the triangle, forming a single closed surface S with K(S) =
3 Kwormhole = −12π. Doesn’t this violate GGB?! (Further examples along these lines can be found

The Topological Degree of the Spherical Map
By now we hope that our examples have made it clear that we will have understood GGB if we
can understand this:
Regardless of the form that the surface Sg takes, n(Sg) will always cover al-
most every point of the sphere (1 −g) times, provided we count the layers
algebraically, taking into account positive and negative orientation.

[16.8] Here Sg takes the form of g bagels, still joined together in the baking tin by (g −1) bridges.
Each bagel has zero total curvature, while each bridge has K = −4π. The total curvature is therefore
(−4π)(g −1) = 2π χ.
In order to clarify this statement, this section will introduce the concept of topological degree,4
which does the precise algebraic counting of the number of times each point of S2 is covered. The
reason we say “almost every point” is to allow for branch points, as mentioned in the case of the
torus.
We begin by noting that (16.5) does not mean that there are only |1 −g| sheets covering S2, in
all. Indeed, in the case of the thick pancake in [16.6], the covering n(Sg) of S2 took the form of one
positive covering, and g negative coverings: a total of (g + 1) coverings. In other words, for any
given point ep = n(p) on S2, there are (g + 1) places pi on the pancake where the normal points in
the direction of ep, i.e., n(pi) = ep, for i = 1, 2, . . . , (g + 1).
Let P(ep) denote the number of these points pi on the surface Sg at which the curvature K(pi)
is positive, so that n is orientation-preserving, and a neighbourhood of the image ep on the sphere is
covered positively. Likewise, let N(s) denote the number points at which K(pi) is negative, so that
n is orientation-reversing, and ep is covered negatively. For example, in the case of the thick pancake
[16.6] above, P(s) = +1, independently of ep; and N(s) = g, also independently of ep. (Here, and in
what follows, we exclude points for which K = 0, as these make no contribution to covering S2.)
We can now deﬁne the topological degree (or, more commonly, just “degree”) of the spherical
map, as follows:
Given a closed, oriented surface Sg of genus g, and a point ep on S2, the topolog-
ical degree of the spherical map—written deg[n(Sg), ep]—is the algebraic count
of the number of times n(Sg) covers ep, taking account of orientation:
deg [n(Sg), ep] ≡P(ep) −N(ep),
where P(ep) is the number of preimages of ep for which K > 0, and N(ep) is the
number of preimages of ep for which K < 0.
(16.6)
4Also called the Brouwer degree, after the Dutch topological pioneer, Brouwer (1881–1966), who was the ﬁrst to systematically
exploit the concept.

Chapter 16 Introduction to the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
In the case that Sg is the thick pancake, P and N are independent of ep, and therefore so is the
degree:
deg[n(g-holed thick pancake)] = P −N = 1 −g.
In the case that Sg is made up of the bridged bagels, [16.8], S2 is covered 2g times by the images
of the g bagels, and a further (g −1) times by the images of the bridges. Thus each point of S2 is
covered by (3g −1) layers. Again in this example, the number of coverings is independent of ep,
and therefore so is the algebraic count of these coverings:
deg[n(g bagels, bridged)] = P −N = g −[g + (g −1)] = 1 −g,
just as before.
The key to understanding GGB (at least from the current point of view) is to be able to see that
this recurring result is no coincidence, but rather that the degree truly is topological in nature—every
Sg must satisfy the same equation:
deg [n(Sg)] = P −N = (1 −g) = 1
2 χ(Sg).
(16.7)
In short, if we can prove (16.7) then we will have proved GGB, (16.1).
16.6
Historical Note
While Gauss and Bonnet certainly paved the road to GGB, neither one of them was ever even
aware of this extraordinary result, let alone stated it!
But the name has stuck. Even those who grasp the name’s historical inaccuracy dare not touch
it now: it would seem that it matters more that we all agree what a name means, than that the name
itself be historically accurate.
As we have discussed, in 1827 Gauss announced his discovery of the Local Gauss–Bonnet
Theorem, (2.6), page 23, stating that if ∆is a geodesic triangle on a general surface, then its angular
excess equals its total curvature:
E(∆) = K(∆).
In fact the Local Gauss–Bonnet Theorem refers to a generalization of Gauss’s original result (by
Bonnet in 1848) to the case where the sides of the triangle are no longer required to be geodesics.
This adds to the right-hand side of the above equation a term representing the total geodesic
curvature of the sides.5 However, neither of these gentlemen said anything at all about closed
surfaces.
It would appear that the honour of discovering GGB actually belongs, in two distinct steps,
to Leopold Kronecker and to Walther Dyck.6 First, in 1869 Kronecker introduced the concept of
degree—later clariﬁed and exploited by Brouwer—and proved that K(Sg) = 4π deg(n). Second,
in 1888 Dyck proved that deg(n) = 1
2χ, thereby completing the proof of GGB in its modern form,
(16.1).
5This will proved at the end of Act IV: Exercise 6, page 336.
6See Hirsch (1976). Occasionally, as in Berger (2010, page 380), Werner Boy is credited with GGB. However, Boy (1903)
explicitly gave credit for GGB to Kronecker and to Dyck, while Boy himself generalized GGB to nonorientable surfaces.

Total Curvature of a Plane Loop: Hopf’s Umlaufsatz
To begin to understand the topological nature of the degree of the spherical map (i.e., (16.7)), and
with it GGB (i.e., (16.1)), we shall drop down a dimension. That is, in place of the spherical/normal
map n of a 2-dimensional surface S in R3 to the 2-dimensional sphere S2, we shall instead consider
the normal map N of a 1-dimensional curve C in R2 to the 1-dimensional circle S1.
Since GGB involves closed surfaces, we shall correspondingly restrict attention to the case
where C is a closed curve. Furthermore, let us begin with the most elementary case, in which C is
not only closed, but is also simple—i.e., without any self-intersections. Let us call such a simple,
closed curve a loop.
Although we shall ultimately be concerned with smooth curves that everywhere have a well-
deﬁned tangent and normal, let us begin with a triangle, ∆, with internal angles θi and external
angles φi, so that θi + φi = π. See [17.1a].
If we imagine a particle travelling counterclockwise round ∆once, then it is clear that it’s
velocity vector v executes one full revolution, and this is indeed equivalent to the fundamental
fact that the angles of ∆sum to π:
net rotation = φ1 + φ2 + φ3 = 2π
⇐⇒
θ1 + θ2 + θ3 = π.
Note that the net rotation statement is somehow the simpler and more fundamental of the two, in
the sense that it remains the same if we generalize to n-gons, whereas the equivalent statement in
terms of internal angles is now dependent upon n:
net rotation =
n
X
i=1
φi = 2π
⇐⇒
n
X
i=1
θi = (n −2)π.
The concept of net rotation becomes important when not all the rotation is in the same direc-
tion. This is vividly illustrated by the movement of a nut along a bolt. Suppose you observe the
initial position of the nut, then shut your eyes while a friend spins the nut in a complicated com-
bination of positive and negative rotations, moving the nut back and forth along the bolt. When
you open your eyes, you have no idea exactly what rotations your friend performed, yet you do
know what the net rotation has been: it is simply measured by how far the nut has moved from its
starting position.
Figure [17.1b] considers this net rotation of the velocity v, but now for a smooth loop C,
instead of a polygon. Whereas the direction of v executed sudden jumps of φi at the vertices
of ∆, its direction now changes smoothly along C, and for the illustrated curve it sometimes turns
positively (counterclockwise), as at x, and sometimes turns negatively (clockwise), as at y. Nev-
ertheless, it seems intuitively clear that as the particle travels along C, its velocity v rocking back
and forth along the way, but after one full positive orbit of C, the net effect is that v has executed
one full positive revolution. Again, in speaking of this net rotation of v, we mean that negative
rotation is allowed to cancel positive rotation.

The fact that v executes one full revolution
in one orbit of a loop is a theorem called Hopf’s
Umlaufsatz (from the German, “Umlauf” (circula-
tion), and “Satz” (theorem)). And while you may
not doubt its truth for an uncomplicated curve like
that in [17.1b], is it really so obvious for the “sim-
ple” curve in [17.3]?! Furthermore, the result does
not apply to curves that intersect themselves. For
example, what is the net rotation [exercise] for a
ﬁgure-eight curve?
While this result was in some sense known since
antiquity, Watson (1917) seems to have been the ﬁrst
to articulate it clearly, while Hopf (1935) was the
ﬁrst to provide a purely topological proof. Hopf’s
ingenious geometric idea is described in Exercise
23. Here, however, we wish to provide a different,
heuristic proof that will serve as an exact model for
a corresponding proof of GGB.
We begin by making explicit connections with our previous discussion of GGB. First, recall
that the curvature κ is simply the rate of rotation of v with arc length s (or time, if the particle
travels at unit speed). Thus, the Umlaufsatz can be rephrased in terms of the topological invariance
of the total curvature of the loop:
I
C
κ ds =
I
C
dφ = net rotation of v = 2π,
(17.1)
independently of the shape of C. This bears a striking family resemblance to GGB!
To relate this to the spherical/normal map, let the unit normal to C be N, and, as in [12.1],
page 131, view this as a mapping N from the point p of the plane curve C to the the point ep = N(p)
on the unit circle S1 that lies at the tip of Np.
While Hopf stated his result in terms of the rotation of the tangent, we may equally well say
that that it is N that makes one net revolution after orbiting C once. Equivalently, we may say that,
algebraically, N(C) covers S1 once.

•

v
[17.3] Is it really so obvious that (net rotation of v) = 2π?
Over the segment δs of C, the directions of the normal vectors are spread over angle δφ, and
therefore the tips of these normal vectors ﬁll an arc of length δes = δφ on S1. Thus, as we ﬁrst
discussed on page 131,
κ = local length magniﬁcation factor of the N map ≍δes
δs,
and therefore,
I
C
κ ds = 2π [Number of times N(C) covers S1].
(17.2)
As with our discussion of GGB, we next introduce the degree of N, to clarify how to algebraically
count the the number of times N(C) covers S1.
Even if C is not a simple loop, but is allowed self-intersections, we can deﬁne the degree of
the spherical/normal map N in exactly the same way as before. If κ(p) > 0 then N(p) is rotating
positively (counterclockwise) round S1 as the particle travels through p on C. Likewise, if κ(p) < 0
then N(p) is instead rotating negatively (clockwise) round S1. Then,
Given a closed curve C, traced counterclockwise, and a point ep on S1, the degree
of the spherical/normal map N is the algebraic count of the number of times N(C)
covers ep, taking account of orientation:
deg [N(C), ep] ≡P(ep) −N(ep),
where P(ep) is the number of preimages of ep for which κ > 0, and N(ep) is the
number of preimages of ep for which κ < 0.
(17.3)
With this more precise deﬁnition in place, the key fact is that the degree is independent of the
choice of ep, so that (17.2) takes the form,

κ ds = 2π deg[N(C)].

[17.4] The degree of N is the algebraic count of how many times N(C) covers S1. The sign of κ changes at the
inﬂection points a and b, causing the image on S1 to reverse direction at ea and eb. This in turn can be thought of
a folding of the orbit back on itself. Since ep is traversed three times, twice with positive motion, and once with
negative motion, the net number of coverings of ep is 2 −1 = 1.
Hopf’s Umlaufsatz states that deg[N(simple loop)] = +1, in which case (17.4) reduces to
(17.1).
17.2
Total Curvature of a Deformed Circle
Let us illustrate and clarify these ideas with a concrete example. If C is a circle, then as x orbits
C once, its image ex = N(x) orbits S1 once, with matching angular speed. Clearly, deg[N(C)] = +1.
Now suppose that we gradually and symmetrically deform the circle, so that C takes the form
shown on the left of [17.4], resembling the cross section of a pear.
For the illustrated point eq on S1 there is precisely one preimage q on C. But for point ep there
are instead three preimages p1, p2, p3.
A helpful mental device in locating these preimages of ep is to ﬁrst observe that the tangent
to S1 at ep (not shown) must be parallel to the tangent to C at each preimage of ep. Now imagine
taking this tangent line at ep and letting it move parallel to itself towards C, ultimately sweeping
across all of C. Note each time the moving line touches C: these include all the preimages of ep, but
they also include the preimages of the antipodal point −ep. Where [exercise] are the preimages of
−ep in [17.4]?
Restricting attention to the right hand side of C, we observe that there are precisely two inﬂec-
tion points, a and b, distinguished by the fact that C crosses the tangent line at these points, and
only at these points.
To see that the inﬂection points play a crucial role in relation to the spherical/normal map N,
imagine x starting at q and travelling up the right side of C. Then ex = N(x) travels forward along
S1 from eq through eb and ep until it hits ea. But at ea it bounces and travels backwards, passing through
ep for a second time before hitting eb. Now it bounces again and resumes its forward motion along
S1, passing through ep a third time. Next it arrives at ea for a second time [exercise: where is x at this

17.3 Heuristic Proof of Hopf’s Umlaufsatz
•
179
moment?] and this time it passes right through ea and keeps going. We strongly suggest that you
follow x in your mind as it completes a full orbit of C, with ex performing another back-and-forth
motion as x traverses the left-hand side of C.
Now comes a crucial mental leap in the visualization of this motion: think of the motion of ex
as the orbit of a bead travelling along a continuous, unbroken thread. Thus, as illustrated, when ex ﬁrst
arrives at ea and starts to move backwards on S1, it can only be because the thread is folded back on
itself. Likewise, when the bead next arrives at eb and reverses course again, resuming its forward
motion along S1, it can only be because the thread has folded back on itself a second time. Thus,
as illustrated, as x passes through p1, then p2, and ﬁnally p3, ex passes through ep three times,
ﬁrst forward, then backward along the folded thread, then forward again along the twice-folded
thread.
In reality, all three folded segments of the thread between ea and eb are plastered right down
on top of each other on S1, but we have lifted them away slightly in order to reveal the folds and
the three different places on the thread that correspond to the single point ep of S1.
The positive curvature κ at q gave rise to positive motion through eq. Thus, since q is the only
preimage of eq, P(eq) = 1 and N(eq) = 0, and therefore deg [N(C), eq] ≡P(eq) −N(eq) = 1, as anticipated.
Likewise, the positive curvature κ at p1 and p3 gave rise to positive motion through ep, while
the negative value of κ at p2 gave rise to negative motion through ep. Thus P(ep) = 2 and N(ep) = 1,
and therefore deg [N(C), ep] ≡P(ep) −N(ep) = 1, as before.
17.3
Heuristic Proof of Hopf’s Umlaufsatz
Let us now apply what we have learned from this example to the general case. Imagine beginning
with a circle, and allowing it to continuously deform and evolve into the most general simple
closed curve. Here we are thinking of the form of the curve as a function C(t) of time, with time t
going from 0 to 1, say, and with C(0) being the initial circle, and C(1) being the ﬁnal curve, such as
C in [17.4].
But we restrict this evolution to exclude self-intersections, and to be such that κ is well-deﬁned
everywhere on the intermediate curves: this is necessary if we wish our mapping N to be contin-
uous on each C(t). If a sharp corner were to develop, for example, then N would have a jump
discontinuity there.
As C(t) evolves continuously, so too does the orbit of ex, as embodied and visualized as
a stretchable, unbreakable, foldable string wrapped around S1. Whenever an inﬂection point
develops in C(t), signaling a change in the sign of κ there, the image string develops a fold.
If ex stays away from such folds, both P and N remain separately constant, and therefore so too
does their difference, deg [N[C(t)], ex]. However, if ex crosses a point of folding, we either gain two
new layers of opposite orientation, or we lose two layers of opposite orientation. But, this means
that P and N both increase by 1 or they both decrease by 1. In either event, the crucial observation
is that,
Changes in the sign of κ on C cause folding of N(C) on S1, but this folding has no
effect on the number of layers (counted algebraically) that cover S1.
That is, deg [N {C(t)}] = P(ex) −N(ex) remains constant as we cross a fold. Thus deg [N {C(t)}] is a
well-deﬁned property of the curve as a whole, independent of ex.
The value of deg [N {C(t)}] must vary continuously with time, and remain an integer: thus it
cannot change at all. But, initially, deg [N {C(0)}] = 1. Therefore, since the ﬁnal value of the degree
is the same as its initial value, deg [N {C(1)}] = 1, as Hopf asserted.

[17.5] The degree of n is the algebraic count of how many times n(S) covers S2. The sign of K changes as
we cross A and B, causing the image on S2 to reverse orientation as we cross eA and eB. Since, ep is covered
three times, twice with positive orientation, and once with negative orientation, the net number of coverings of ep
is 2 −1 = 1.
17.4
Total Curvature of a Deformed Sphere
In [17.4] we likened C to a cross section of a pear. We now turn our attention to the surface of the
pear itself!
That is, let us take the right half of C and rotate it 2π about the vertical axis through its ends to
generate the pear-like surface of revolution S shown in [17.5]. As is visually evident (and as was
previously noted in (10.13), p. 114) the segments of C with κ > 0 generate elliptic regions of S with
K > 0, and the segments of C with κ < 0 generate hyperbolic regions of S with K < 0. The inﬂection
points a and b rotate to generate two circles A and B (both parabolic; i.e., with K = 0) that separate
the positively and negatively curved parts of the pear’s surface.
But the ﬁgure also illustrates the fact that there are two other circles, A0 and B0, that have the
same images under the spherical map as A and B: eA = f
A0 and eB = f
B0. These four circles divide S
into a top region, a bottom region, and the three regions in between, which we have shaded grey
and labelled R1, R2, R3. All three of these regions Ri are mapped to the same region eR on S2.
Since K > 0 on R1 and R3, the spherical map is orientation-preserving in those regions, and a
point in those regions is therefore mapped to a point on S2 that is covered positively. On the other
hand, since K < 0 on R2, the spherical map is orientation-reversing in that region, and a point in
that region is is therefore mapped to a point on S2 that is covered negatively.
In particular, the ﬁgure illustrates the three preimages p1, p2, p3 of a point ep in eR. Thus, since
ep is covered three times, twice with positive orientation, and once with negative orientation, the
net number of coverings of ep is 2 −1 = 1.
Let us not lose sight of original formulation of GGB in terms of curvature, and our quest to
understand why the total curvature of a closed surface is topologically invariant. In the case of our
deformed sphere S, the total curvature residing in the unshaded top of the pear is the area of the

17.5 Heuristic Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
•
181
northern polar cap of S2; likewise, the total curvature in the unshaded bottom of S is likewise the
area of the larger unshaded southern region. Each of the three shaded regions contains the same
amount of curvature, namely, the area of eR. But since K < 0 on R2, n is orientation reversing there,
and therefore its total curvature is the negative of the area of eR. Integrating the curvature over all
of S therefore yields the whole area of S2, once: i.e., 4π.
17.5
Heuristic Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
In the lower-dimensional case, we gained a much more intuitive understanding of the degree by
thinking of the spherical image of the curve as being a stretchable, foldable thread covering S1. In
the present case, it is likewise very helpful to imagine n(S) as being a highly stretchable, unbreakable,
foldable membrane covering S2—perhaps think of very thinly rolled out pizza dough. But under-
stand that this special mathematical dough can not only be stretched out in whatever manner we
require, but it can also contract just as easily, as needed.
On the left of [17.5], think of the entire surface of the pear S as being covered with such a thin
layer of pizza dough, loosely sticking to the surface. Let us not worry for now about the geometry
of the spherical map, and instead focus solely on the topology of how it maps the grey region
R1 ∪R2 ∪R3 on S to the grey region eR on S2. See [17.6].
The arrows in this diagram indicate the sequence of topological transformations to be carried
out. First, suppose we tie two pieces of string around A and B0 to keep them in place, and then
stretch B radially outward till it is the same size as B0, and likewise stretch A0 radially outward
till it is the same size as A, stretching R2 and R3 into two illustrated portions of cones.
Next, leaving new A0 in place, let us move the new B vertically downward and stick it onto
B0, folding R2 on top of R1 in the process. Note, crucially, how this folding causes the positive
circulation around p2 to be reversed. The fate of the large letter “T” in R2 serves to stress this point.
Now move the new A0 vertically downward and stick it onto A, folding R3 on top of the new
R2 (and R1) in the process.
At this point we have correctly embodied the topology of the spherical image, and we can
imagine doing a ﬁnal geometric housekeeping, pushing the top of the pear downward to make
it spherical (and of unit radius), and stretching each of the three folded grey layers to get the
geometry of the spherical map correct, so that, in particular, ep1, ep2, and ep3 will all end up on top
of each other, but with their orientations having been reversed between successive layers by the
folding.
The details of how we arrived at this ﬁnal state are irrelevant; our speciﬁc intermediate trans-
formations were chosen merely to make this net transformation easier to imagine and draw. Also,
this example involved a slight sleight of hand: if g ̸= 0 then n(Sg) must have multiple layers,
and we cannot imagine starting with a single layer of dough covering Sg and manipulating it to
obtain n(S).
At this point we can instead try to imagine directly (without intermediate steps) the effect
of the spherical map on the evolving surface S. If we start with a spherical S0 and gradually
deform it into the pear-shaped surface in [17.5], then we can imagine the mathematical dough
n(S0) covering S2 following a corresponding evolution. As negative curvature emerges on the
deformed S0 at parabolic curves, so the spherical image ﬂows backwards over itself at the images
of these parabolic curves, producing folds there. But as we cross such a fold in n(S0) on S2 we
always gain or lose two new layers of opposite orientation, so the algebraic sum of the number of
coverings is unaltered.
This same reasoning applies if we instead start with some Sg (where g ̸= 0) and allow it to
evolve. For example, suppose that initially Sg takes the form of the g bridged bagels of [16.8].
Now suppose we press inward with our thumb on the outer (positively curved) surface of one
of the bagels, creating a depression centred at a point p. As we do so, n(Sg) will undergo a

[17.6] The topological consequence of a change of sign of K is folding of the spherical image. As we cross the
boundary between regions of opposite curvature, the spherical image either gains or loses two layers of opposite
orientation, so the algebraic count of the number of coverings of S2 (i.e., the degree) remains constant, and the
total curvature is therefore a topological invariant.
corresponding evolution in the vicinity of ep, lying on one of the g sheets that positively covers S2.
That single sheet, out of the total of (3g −1) sheets, will undergo an evolution like that described
in the previous paragraph. This single sheet containing ep will fold over on itself, creating two new
layers of opposite orientation in a topological annulus centred at ep, but (algebraically) this folded
region will continue to cover S2 once positively, and therefore the net number of coverings of S2
will remain (1 −g), even in the vicinity of ep.
This concludes our ﬁrst (heuristic) explanation of GGB.

The Euler Characteristic
Thus far we have introduced the Euler characteristic χ as merely a convenient alternative means of
labelling a closed, orientable surface, Sg, of a given genus g. However, χ actually has a deﬁnition
and meaning all its own, which applies to a much wider class of objects than closed, orientable
surfaces. Once we have explained this deeper meaning of χ, we may apply it to Sg, in particular,
and it is then an important theorem (not a deﬁnition) that χ(Sg) = 2 −2g.

Euler’s (Empirical) Polyhedral Formula
[18.1] Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)
The story of Euler’s characteristic begins
on the 14th of November, 1750, not with
smooth surfaces, but rather with poly-
hedra. On that date, Euler—pictured in
[18.1]—wrote a letter to Christian Gold-
bach,1
outlining a remarkable empirical
discovery, which Euler ﬁnally succeeded
in proving two years later.2
The discovery rested on a realization
that may seem strangely obvious to mod-
ern eyes: Euler was the ﬁrst to clearly
recognize the very existence of a polyhe-
dron’s vertices, edges, and faces. As he
wrote in the letter,
Therefore three kinds of bounds
are to be considered in any kind
of body, namely 1) points, 2)
lines, and 3) surfaces, with the
names speciﬁcally used for this

the sum of two primes; this is now known as Goldbach’s Conjecture. While it is believed to be true, and (as of 2017) has been
veriﬁed by computer up to 4, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, it remains unproven after almost 300 years.

angle contained between the faces that met at a vertex, rather than on the vertex itself. If we
gradually change the dimensions of a polyhedron, the solid angles will vary continuously, but the
discrete count V of the number of vertices will remain constant. This discrete count V is what Euler
now seized upon.
Likewise, before Euler, nobody had given much thought to what Euler described as “the junc-
tures where two faces come together along their sides, which, for lack of an accepted term, I call
edges.” Euler then went on to count the number E of these edges, and the number F of faces. This
shift from looking at polyhedra in terms of continuously varying lengths and angles, to looking
instead at discrete topological features, was yet one more instance of Euler’s genius.
Having made this subtle but profound leap, it did not take Euler long to detect a remarkable
empirical pattern. Figure [18.2] illustrates the ﬁve Platonic solids, and next to each are listed the
values of V, F, (V + F), and E. As is now obvious, and as Euler was the ﬁrst3 to announce, the
(V + F) entries exceed the E entries by 2. In all cases, as Euler wrote to Goldbach, we have
Euler’s original formula:
V + F = E + 2.
While we have merely veriﬁed this for the ﬁve Platonic solids, Euler tested many more non-
Platonic examples, and in his letter to Goldbach in 1750 he stated his conviction that it was a
universal truth about polyhedra, though he confessed he had no idea how to prove it at the time.
The result is now known as Euler’s Polyhedral Formula. Only gradually did mathematicians dis-
cover the precise limits of its universality: in fact the formula only applies if the polyhedron is
topologically spherical.
The above formula is not, however, the modern form of the result. If we move the E to the
other side of the equation, we obtain a result that is trivially equivalent, algebraically speaking.
However, this seemingly trivial step represents a highly nontrivial conceptual advance (ﬁrst taken
by Poincaré in 1895), for the left hand side of the equation is now a single integer that characterizes
the polyhedron P, and this is our new deﬁnition of its
Euler characteristic:
χ(P) ≡V −E + F.
(18.1)
Armed with this concept, here is the modern form of Euler’s Polyhedral Formula:
χ(topologically spherical polyhedron) = 2.
(18.2)
This is in accord with our previous deﬁnition of χ(Sg) = 2 −2g, with g = 0, but the key differ-
ence is that now we will be able to prove that (18.2) follows from (18.1). In fact, we shall present
two quite different proofs.
Euler himself did ultimately succeed in providing the very ﬁrst proof of his own formula, and
in some ways his proof is more topologically natural than the two that we shall instead present,
but there are subtle obstacles that must be overcome in order to make his argument completely
convincing. (See Richeson 2008, Ch. 7, for details.)
3In 1860, more than a century after Euler announced his wonderful discovery, a long-lost manuscript miraculously surfaced,
two centuries after it had been written. It revealed that Descartes had made essentially the same discovery as Euler (but in a
different form) as early as 1630, more than a century before Euler! The fascinating story is well told in both Stillwell (2010,
p. 469) and Richeson (2008, Ch. 9).

[18.2] Euler’s Polyhedral Formula, empirically veriﬁed for all ﬁve Platonic solids: V + F = E + 2.
Although we have not yet provided any proof of (18.2), we end this section by noting that it
has many consequences, one of the most striking of which concerns the ﬁve Platonic solids shown
in [18.2]. First, recall that Euclid’s Elements4 provided a geometric proof (outlined in Ex. 24) that
these ﬁve are the only “regular polyhedra” that can exist. A regular polyhedron is one for which
all the faces are congruent regular polygons, and the same number of these regular polygons meet
at each vertex.
4Although Euclid is responsible for publishing the proof in his Elements, the proof itself is believed to be due to Theaetetus of
Athens (a friend of Plato), dating from around 400 BCE.

Now suppose that we completely relax the geometrical constraints, and only insist that each
“face”—which we now imagine to be curved, bendable, and stretchable—has the same number
of wavy edges, and that an equal number of these irregular, bendy faces meet at each ver-
tex. Exercise 25 uses (18.2) to demonstrate the remarkable fact that it is still true that there
are only ﬁve topological possibilities, each one being topologically indistinguishable from one
of the ﬁve Platonic solids of antiquity. Thus the mesmerizing geometrical beauty and regu-
larity of the ﬁve Platonic solids turns out to have been an extraordinary, 2000-year-long red
herring!
18.3
Cauchy’s Proof of Euler’s Polyhedral Formula
18.3.1
Flattening Polyhedra
From the time of the Ancient Greeks, all the way through the eighteenth century, polyhedra were
viewed as solid objects; indeed, we still speak of Platonic solids. Cauchy, in 1813, appears to have
been the ﬁrst to make the conceptual leap of peeling the polyhedron off the solid it bounds,
viewing it as a hollow surface in its own right.
His next crucial step towards proving Euler’s Polyhedral Formula (18.2) was to ﬂatten this
hollow surface onto the plane. Cauchy was somewhat vague about precisely how this was to be
accomplished, and Richeson (2008, Ch. 12) does an admirable job of elucidating both Cauchy’s
approach, and subsequent clariﬁcations by other mathematicians.
One thing is certain, though: Cauchy’s thinking was still ﬁrmly planted in geometry, and his
polyhedra necessarily had straight edges and plane faces, and their ﬂattened versions were also
required to have straight edges. Additionally, his proof required the polyhedron to be convex:
this stringent geometrical requirement means that if your eye is anywhere inside the polyhedron,
you can see the entire surface—there’s nowhere to hide inside a convex polyhedron! But convex-
ity is clearly not a topological condition, and therefore it cannot be essential to the validity of
Euler’s Polyhedral Formula. We therefore choose to sidestep all these historical artifacts, provid-
ing instead a more modern, purely topological version of Cauchy’s argument, but one that remains
faithful to his brilliant original insight.
To this end, imagine that the faces of the polyhedron are made of a bendable, stretchable
rubber sheet, and picture the vertices and edges as nothing more than dots and connecting curves
drawn in pen on this closed, topologically spherical, polyhedral balloon. Even if we start with a
classical, rectilinear polyhedron, we may now continuously deform it (without cutting or joining
any of its parts) and the resulting curved surface will have the same number of vertices, edges,
and faces drawn upon it as did the original.
To ﬂatten the polyhedron, imagine once again that we start with the classical rigid surface
with plane faces. Now cut out and discard one of these faces, H, and place the polyhedron on a
ﬂat surface, H-side down. The left-hand side of [18.3] illustrates this for a cube. Next, return to
picturing the polyhedron as a rubber sheet (now with the hole H), the vertices being dots drawn on
its surface. Take the vertices that bound the hole H, and pull each of them radially outward within
the plane, so that the boundary of the hole gets larger and larger, and the rest of the polyhedron
is pulled down and ultimately stretched out ﬂat within the expanding hole H. See the right-hand
side of [18.3].
After ﬂattening the polyhedron in this manner, we may further deform the edges (while keep-
ing them in the plane) so that they take on any shape we please, and we do so with topological
impunity, for such a deformation will not change V, E, or F. We shall call the resulting ﬁgure a
polygonal net5.
5More traditional names are network or graph, but the usage of these terms allows for “polygons” with only two sides,
whereas we shall insist that our polygons have at least three sides.

[18.3] To ﬂatten the cube, we remove its bottom face H, then stretch out the resulting hole (hatched) until we
have pulled the remaining faces down into the plane.

[18.4] The Euler characteristic of a polygonal net is unaltered by triangulation.
18.3.2
The Euler Characteristic of a Polygonal Net
Figure [18.4] illustrates a more typical example of a polygonal net, obtained by ﬂattening a non-
Platonic polyhedron.
As Cauchy reasoned, in the process of ﬂattening the polyhedron, we have removed one face,
and we have not altered the number of vertices or edges:
V ; V,
E ; E,
F ; F −1
=⇒
χ ; χ −1.
In short, ﬂattening the polydedron has reduced its Euler characteristic by 1.
It follows that to prove Euler’s Polyhedral Formula (18.2), it sufﬁces to prove this elegant
result:
χ(polygonal net) = 1.
(18.3)
You may care to check that this is true for the speciﬁc example we have drawn.
To show that this is always true, we begin by observing that we may dissect each n-gon (with
n > 3) into triangles, and that, crucially, this process of triangulation does not alter the value of χ.
The ﬁgure illustrates two approaches to the dissection. In polygon P1 (which we suppose to
be an n-gon) we draw in the (n −3) curvilinear “diagonals” from one vertex to all the others,
splitting this one face into (n −2) triangles, for a net increase (pardon the pun!) of (n −3) faces.
Thus,
in case P1:
V ; V,
E ; E + (n −3),
F ; F + (n −3)
=⇒
χ ; χ.
In P2 (which we suppose to be an m-gon) we have instead added a vertex somewhere inside,
and have then joined this to the m vertices, creating m new edges. This splits this one face into m

triangles, for a net increase of (m −1) faces. Thus,
in case P2:
V ; V + 1,
E ; E + m,
F ; F + (m −1)
=⇒
χ ; χ.
The left-hand side of [18.5] shows one possible way of completing the triangulation, and we have
just proved that its Euler characteristic must be the same as that of the original polygonal net.
Having gone to all the trouble of constructing this triangulation, the ﬁnal step in the proof of
(18.3) is to demolish it! That is, we shall gradually erase each of the triangles, one by one, until only
one triangle remains standing. In order to reduce the number of cases that need be considered,
we shall agree to only nibble away triangles around the edges; we shall not burrow through the
middle of the net, which could split it into two distinct, disconnected islands.
With this agreement in place, there are only two cases to consider: either a boundary triangle
shares one (dotted) edge with the interior of the net (e.g., ∆1), or else it shares two (dotted) edges
(e.g., ∆2).
First, suppose that we
erase ∆1:
V ; V −1,
E ; E −2,
F ; F −1
=⇒
χ ; χ.
Second, suppose that we
erase ∆2:
V ; V,
E ; E −1,
F ; F −1
=⇒
χ ; χ.
Ultimately, only one triangle ∆will remain standing, and its Euler characteristic will be
χ(∆) = V −E + F = 3 −3 + 1 = 1.
Since χ is invariant under the triangulation process [18.4], and under the demolition process [18.5],
its initial value must equal its ﬁnal value, 1, so we have proved (18.3). And with this, we have also
completed Cauchy’s proof of Euler’s Polyhedral Formula.

Legendre’s Proof of Euler’s Polyhedral Formula
Recall Harriot’s beautiful result (1.3), page 8, relating the angular excess E of a geodesic triangle on
the sphere to its area A. As you proved in Exercise 5, page 83, this can be generalized to geodesic

n-gons. A Euclidean n-gon has angle sum (n −2)π, and therefore the angular excess E of a geodesic
n-gon on a curved surface is
E(n-gon) = [angle sum] −(n −2)π.
(18.4)
From the proven additivity of E, Harriot’s result then yields,
1
R2 A(n-gon) = E(n-gon) = [angle sum] −nπ + 2π,
(18.5)
where R is the radius of the sphere.
2

2
[18.6] The value of E for the geodesic
n-gon can be visualized as the sum of
everything in the picture.
Figure [18.6] provides a valuable visualization6 of
the expression for the angular excess on the right hand
side of this formula. Inside the n-gon, (A) mark the inte-
rior angles θ1, θ2, . . . , θn; (B) write “−π” next to each
edge; (C) write “2π” in the middle. Then E is the sum
of everything in the picture: (A) + (B) + (C).
Legendre presented an ingenious proof in 1794,
the ﬁrst step of which was to project the polyhedron
onto a sphere. The speciﬁc way in which he carried
out this projection (described in Ex. 26) required him to
assume that the polyhedron was convex, just as Cauchy
would also do, 20 years later. But, as we have noted
in the context of Cauchy’s proof, convexity cannot
actually be relevant to a topological result. Therefore,
once again, we shall sidestep this historical artifact
and present a more blatantly topological version of the
argument—one that does not hinge on convexity, but
that stays true to Legendre’s essential insight.
As before, imagine our polyhedron P to be a curved, topologically spherical, rubber mem-
brane, with dots (vertices) and connecting curves (edges) drawn simply on its surface. Instead of
collapsing the polyhedron, as we did in Cauchy’s proof, let us this time inﬂate it like a balloon!
We thereby arrive at a polygonal net covering the surface of an ultimately spherical balloon. Note
that the edges that result from this are not geodesics, but, as we now explain, we can easily make
them so without altering the Euler characteristic.
Imagine this sphere to be rigid, with small nails driven in at each of the vertices we have
just constructed. Next, picture the current, nongeodesic edges as being made of stretched elastic
strings, temporarily held in place and attached to the nails (vertices) at their ends. Further imagine
that there is no friction between these elastic strings and the sphere: they are free to slide over the
surface without resistance. Now let us hammer the nails down ﬂat onto the surface, so that any
string that is not attached to this particular nail can sweep over its location without getting caught
on it.
Finally, release the strings! They will automatically contract to create the shortest (= geodesic =
great circle) routes between the nails. We have thus arrived at a geodesic polygonal net that
completely covers the sphere, and its Euler characteristic must the same as the original value, χ(P).
Now we come to the second part of Legendre’s ingenious idea: sum both sides of the formula
(18.5) over all the geodesic polygons Pj that make up this geodesic, sphere-covering net, an exam-
ple of which is shown in [18.7]. Let us look ﬁrst at the sum of the right-hand side. The efﬁcacy of
the visualization [18.6] is now evident, for it enables us to see the value of this sum for the complete
net, as follows.
6We hit upon this idea independently, but have since found it published by Richeson (2008, p. 95).

all the polygons, so, in particular, we are summing all
the angles that surround this vertex, yielding 2π. Since
each vertex contributes 2π, the total contribution of the
interior angles is 2πV. Next, each edge has a ∗(i.e., −π)

each face carries a J (i.e., 2π), yielding a total of 2πF.
Thus,

Despite its evident beauty, Legendre’s proof feels morally wrong, for it achieves success
(perversely) by means of continuously varying geometrical angles that are meaningless within
topology. But from the point of view of Differential Geometry, it is perhaps the right kind of proof,
for it appears to link geometry and topology in a surprising way that might help to explain GGB.
As we shall see shortly, this optimism is justiﬁed.

Adding Handles to a Surface to Increase Its Genus
In order to connect these latest ideas with GGB, our next step is to show that our new deﬁnition
(18.1) of the Euler characteristic does indeed imply (16.2) as a theorem:
χ(Sg) = 2 −2g.
(18.7)
We do not believe that this result has an agreed upon name, which permits us to call it the Euler–
L’Huilier formula, in honour of Simon Antoine Jean L’Huilier, who in 1813 was the ﬁrst person to
state this generalization of Euler’s result; see Richeson (2008, Ch. 15) for details.
We have just given two proofs of this theorem in the topologically spherical case, g = 0, so
now we need to understand the effect of putting holes in our surface. Clearly, we should begin by
trying to understand the simplest case, namely, the torus/doughnut with one hole, g = 1.

We shall tackle this problem by means of a joke, and it’s a bad joke, at that—“probably the
ﬁrst time such a [thing] has ever been used for constructive purposes.”7 The joke goes like this: A
topologist is a person who cannot tell a coffee mug from a doughnut.
The truth behind the joke is illustrated in [18.8]. Halfway through the transformation of
the mug into the doughnut, the body of the mug has coalesced into a blob, still with a handle
attached to it. If we now imagine this blob growing to become a sphere, we arrive at the important
observation ﬁrst made by Felix Klein in 1882:8
A torus is topologically equivalent to a sphere with a handle attached. More
generally, Sg is topologically equivalent to a sphere with g handles attached.
(18.8)
(See Further Reading (at the end of this book) for rigorous statements and proofs of all our plausible
but unproven claims regarding the topological classiﬁcation of surfaces.)
To prove (18.7), it now sufﬁces to prove that
Adding a handle to a closed surface S reduces χ(S) by 2.
(18.9)
Granted this, the addition of g handles clearly reduces χ by 2g. But we have already established
that a topological sphere has χ = 2, so adding g handles therefore reduces this to χ(Sg) = 2 −2g,
thereby proving (18.7).

...then bend tube
into a handle!
Remove both ends...
[18.9] To create a simple handle, remove the ends from the triangular prism (represented here by a Toblerone®
box), then bend the tube to create the handle (with vanishing Euler characteristic).
To prove (18.9), we will ﬁrst construct a handle, then glue it to the given surface, S. Figure
[18.9] shows the construction of an especially simple handle out of a Toblerone® box, i.e., a trian-
gular right prism. We begin by removing the two triangular end faces (so F ; F −2), thereby creating
a hollow tube. By Euler’s Polyhedral Formula, or [exercise] by simple counting,
χ(Toblerone box) = 2
=⇒
χ(hollow tube) = 0.
Finally, as illustrated, we imagine the tube to be fashioned out of rubber, and we bend it into the
form of a hollow handle. This does not alter its Euler characteristic, so
χ(handle) = 0.
Next, as illustrated in [18.10], we create two holes in our surface S, to which the ends of this
handle will be glued. To do so, suppose that we have triangulated9 S. Next, remove two of these
triangular faces, so F ; F −2, and χ(S) ; χ(S) −2.
Figure [18.10] depicts the handle moving towards the now two-holed S, moments before it
gets glued to the holes in S. The ends of the handle have six vertices and six edges, and the same
is true of the holes. But after they are glued together, only six vertices and six edges remain: a net
reduction of six vertices and six edges. But this means that the total Euler characteristic is unaltered
by the act of gluing on the handle. (NOTE: Clearly, this is still true if the ends of the handle are n-gons
(with n > 3), glued to matching n-gon holes.)
Thus, if eS is the new surface obtained by gluing on the handle,
χ(eS)
=
χ(two-holed S + glued on handle)
=
χ(two-holed S) + χ(handle prior to gluing)
=
χ(S) −2 + 0,
thereby proving (18.9), and therefore also (18.7).
For an elegant alternative approach, due to Hopf, see Exercise 27.

triangles.

[18.10] The general closed surface S extends to the left in an unknown manner, indicated by ???. We cut out

no effect on χ(S). Thus gluing on a handle reduces χ(S) by 2.
18.6
Angular Excess Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Let us return to Legendre’s proof of Euler’s Polyhedral Formula, and let us take one step back
from the result upon which it hinged: the generalization of Harriot’s result, (18.5). Focus for now
only on the right hand side, the “angular excess,” given by (18.4):
E(n-gon) = [angle sum] −nπ + 2π.
Of course the whole point of this expression is to measure the excess of the interior angles of
a geodesic n-gon over and above the prediction of Euclidean Geometry. If we drop the requirement
that the sides of the n-gon are geodesics, then this interpretation ceases to apply. Furthermore,
the expression is always devoid of topological meaning, for it involves angles. Nevertheless, the
expression itself remains meaningful even if the sides of the n-gon are not geodesics.
Despite the untopological nature of this expression, our ﬁrst crucial step on the road to a new
explanation of GGB is the realization that the sum of this expression over the entire polygonal net
does have topological meaning. Indeed, even if the edges are not geodesics, we see that [18.7] and
its conclusion, (18.6), remain valid:
∑
j E(Pj) = 2π [V −E + F] = 2π χ(P).
For all that was needed in the proof of this result was the fact that the angles in [18.7] that surround
a vertex sum to 2π.
By the same token, this part of Legendre’s proof does not depend on the topologically spher-
ical polyhedron being inﬂated into a perfectly round geometric sphere. Indeed, and this is the next
crucial point, it does not even depend on the surface being topologically spherical: (18.6) remains
valid on a surface Sg of arbitrary genus g.

•
Chapter 18 Second (Angular Excess) Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
As topologically cavalier as we have been (and shall continue to be!) we would be remiss if
we did not point out that we cannot cast a completely arbitrary polygonal net over Sg. Instead, we
must exercise a modicum of caution: we must not allow our polygons to join onto themselves. On the
torus, for example, we can certainly imagine (but must avoid) a polygon that stretches through
the hole and returns to bite its own tail!
With our topological conscience now clear(er), we return to our effort to explain GGB, and to
the key equation in Legendre’s proof, namely, the generalized Harriot result, (18.5), for an arbitrary
geodesic polygon Pj in the net:
1
R2 A(Pj) = E(Pj).
While the sum of the right-hand side has just been seen to be to be topological in nature—and
always equal to 2π χ(Sg)—equality with the left-hand side is only valid if we (i) inﬂate the poly-
hedron into a perfect sphere of radius R and (ii) ensure that all the edges of the polygonal net are
geodesic arcs of great circles on this sphere.
Although Harriot could not have recognized it in 1603, two centuries later Gauss taught us
that the sphere has constant curvature K = (1/R2), and that the left-hand side of the above equation
should in fact be viewed as the total curvature K(Pj) residing within Pj:
K(Pj) = K A(Pj) = 1
R2 A(Pj).
Gauss’s 1827 form of the Local Gauss–Bonnet Theorem, ((2.6), p. 23), was a tremendous gen-
eralization of this result: the angular excess of a geodesic triangle ∆on a general curved surface
is likewise given by the total curvature within. And just as Harriot’s original result generalizes to
geodesic polygons, so too does Gauss’s result, and in exactly the same manner:
E(∆) =
∫∫
∆
K dA
=⇒
E(Pj) =
∫∫
Pj
K dA = K(Pj).
Finally, summing over all the geodesic polygons, and using (18.6) and (18.7), we have arrived
at our second proof of GGB:
K(Sg) = ∑
j K(Pj) = ∑
j E(Pj) = 2π χ(Sg) = 2π (2 −2g).

We end Act III (the traditional “climax” of our drama) with a beautiful link between geometry,

are needed to achieve a new understanding of GGB; for a much fuller account of vector ﬁelds,
linked to Complex Analysis and to Physics, see chapters 10, 11, and 12 of VCA. See also Further
Reading, at the end of this book.

Vector Fields in the Plane
Imagine a thin layer of ﬂuid ﬂowing over a horizontal plane. It will be to our advantage to think
of this plane as the complex plane, C. At each point z of C we therefore have a velocity vector,
or rather, a complex number, V(z), which we draw emanating from z. This ﬂow V(z) is called a
vector ﬁeld on C.
We shall suppose that our vector ﬁeld V(z) is extremely well behaved, being continuous and
differentiable1 at all but a ﬁnite number of isolated points. Thus, at a normal or regular point,
a small movement in any direction results in a correspondingly small, ultimately proportional,
change in the direction and length of V.
In contrast to this, a singular point s is an exceptional place where the vector ﬁeld suffers a
discontinuity: inﬁnitesimal movements away from s in different directions result in V pointing in
completely different directions or having completely different lengths.
Figure [19.1] illustrates a typical vector ﬁeld, in which the singular points a, b and c are
instantly identiﬁable to the untrained eye, marked with black dots, for clarity.
If we follow the path of an individual particle of ﬂuid, we obtain a streamline K (or integral
curve) of the ﬂow, such that V is always tangent to K. If we trace all such streamlines, as we shall
do in examples below, then we obtain a vivid depiction of the vector ﬁeld as a whole, called the
phase portrait. Note that the phase portrait completely encapsulates the information about the
direction Θ(z) = arg[V(z)] of V(z) at every point.
In [19.1] the vectors all have equal length, but this is certainly not true in general, as we shall
illustrate in the examples that follow. This is a serious deﬁciency of the phase portrait, for it fails2
to illustrate the magnitude, |V(z)|, and this magnitude represents vital information: the speed of a
ﬂuid ﬂow, or the strength of a magnetic ﬁeld, for example. Nevertheless, from the point of view
of topology, the phase portrait is the only thing that matters.
1In the weaker real sense, not the complex analytic sense of being an amplitwist.
2In the case of the most physically important vector ﬁelds, there is in fact a special way to draw the streamlines so that the
strength of the ﬂow becomes visible, as the crowding together of the streamlines. See VCA, pages 494–502.

IV(a) is the number of revolutions executed by V(z) as z travels counterclockwise once around a, along a
loop such as L. Since V executes one clockwise (i.e., negative) revolution as we loop around a, we see that
IV(a) = −1.
19.3
The Index of a Singular Point
Just as the locations of the singular points are obvious, so too are their dramatically different char-
acters. If we imagine the ﬂow pattern [19.1] drawn on a rubber sheet, which is then stretched this
way and that, we intuit that the character of a is quite different from that of b or c, and that
this distinction is invariant under the stretching. In other words, it seems clear that the charac-
ter of a singular point s is not so much a geometric feature as it is a topological feature of the
ﬂow.
Indeed, these different characters lead to different names for the various types of singular
points. For example, in [19.1], a is called a saddle point (or crosspoint), for this is the way water
ﬂows when it is poured over a horse’s saddle; b is called a dipole, for this is the way the magnetic
ﬁeld lines stream between the two poles of a short bar magnet; and c is called a vortex (or focus),
for this is the way water swirls around and down the drain of a kitchen sink.
We now explain how we may crystalize this vague concept of the “character” of a sin-
gular point s into a single, topologically invariant integer IV(s), called the index of s. (NOTE:
Absent any ambiguity regarding the vector ﬁeld V, we may drop it and abbreviate the notation
to I(s).)
Let us immediately state the deﬁnition, although it may not be immediately evident that it is
even well deﬁned:

19.3 The Index of a Singular Point
•
197
If s is a singular point of a vector ﬁeld V(z), and L is any simple loop containing
s (and no other singular points) then the index IV(s) of s is the net number of
revolutions that V(z) executes as z travels once round L, counterclockwise.
(19.1)
Let us immediately illustrate this with the singular points in [19.1]. Since the index only cares
about the direction of the vectors on L, we have taken the liberty of enlarging these speciﬁc vec-
tors for clarity. As we traverse L, it is clear that V(z) undergoes one clockwise (i.e., negative)
revolution, so
I(saddle point) = −1.
Try your own hand at this by examining the singular points at b and c, and verify that
I(dipole) = +2
and
I(vortex) = +1.
Next, let us make our deﬁnition (19.1) a bit more precise. Let Θ(z) be the angle that V(z)
makes with the horizontal. Of course there are inﬁnitely many choices for this angle, differing
by multiples of 2π, but suppose we choose one at the point z. Provided we insist that Θ(z) vary
continuously, then Θ(z) is now uniquely determined as z moves along a directed curve J, say, that
does not pass through any singular points, for then V(z) varies continuously on J.
We can now deﬁne δJΘ to be the net change in the angle Θ(z) as z travels along J, from Start
to Finish:
δJΘ ≡Θ(Finish) −Θ(Start)
Note that this is the signed change in the angle, so if we reverse the direction of J (denoted −J),
thereby swapping Start and Finish, the sign of δJΘ is also reversed:
δ−J Θ = −δJ Θ.

[19.2] The circular loop L encircles a dipole. If the segment l
of L is deformed into el, carrying z to ez, the angle Θ(z) varies
continuously, so Θ(ez) will be close to its original value, Θ(z).
It follows that the change in Θ along this segment is invariant
under the deformation: δel Θ = δlΘ.
With this understanding and
notation in place, we can restate
our deﬁnition (19.1) of the index as
follows:
IV(s) = 1
2π δLΘ.
(19.3)
By now you probably already
intuit that this deﬁnition is indeed
well deﬁned, but to prove that it
is, consider [19.2], which illustrates
the general argument with an (ini-
tially) circular loop L encircling a
dipole.
Focus attention on the illus-
trated segment l of L, running from
p = Start to q = Finish. As illus-
trated,
δlΘ = Θ(q) −Θ(p).

198
•
Chapter 19 Third (Vector Field) Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Suppose we now continuously deform l a small amount into neighbouring el, without l crossing
any singular points in the process.
As a point z on l evolves into the new point ez of el, the angle Θ(z) will also vary continuously,
so Θ(ez) will be close to its original value, Θ(z). It follows that as ez travels along el, the change δelΘ
must also be close to the change δlΘ as z travels along l.
Now comes the archetypal topological argument. If δelΘ were not identically equal to δlΘ, it
would have to differ from it by a multiple of 2π, but this is impossible, because δelΘ is close to δlΘ.
Thus,
δel Θ = δlΘ.
We may similarly deform any other segment of L, or all of it at once, so we immediately
deduce that the index is indeed independent of the size and shape of L:
If s is a singular point of a vector ﬁeld V(z), and L is any simple loop containing s
(and no other singular points) then the index IV(s) does not change as L contin-
uously deforms into any other such loop, so long as it does not cross any singular
points in the process. In short, IV(s) is independent of L, and is a property of V
that can be attached to s itself.
(19.4)
If we instead view the vector ﬁeld as a complex mapping z 7→V(z) from one complex plane
to another, taking the point z in the ﬁrst plane to the point V(z) in the second, then [exercise] IV(s)
may instead be viewed as the number of times that the image loop V(L) winds around 0. This
is called the winding number of V(L), and it plays a fundamental role in Complex Analysis; see
VCA, Chapter 7.
19.4
The Archetypal Singular Points: Complex Powers
Why did we take our plane to be the complex plane? There are several reasons, but here is an
important one: the archetypal singular points arise naturally from the powers of the complex
variable z:
Pm(z) ≡zm = [r eiθ]m = rm eimθ,
where m is assumed to be an integer.
The only (ﬁnite)3 singular point of Pm(z) is at the origin, and it is easy to determine its index.
Everywhere along the ray in the direction θ, we see that Pm points in the direction mθ; only the
length |Pm(z)| = rm varies as we move along the ray. Thus, if we traverse any loop that goes once
round the origin counterclockwise, so that θ goes from 0 to 2π, then the angle of Pm goes from 0
to 2πm. In other words, Pm executes m (positive or negative) revolutions, so I(0) = m.
For example, reconsider the “dipole” we encountered in [19.1] at b. Figure [19.3] illustrates
that this dipole ﬁeld is none other than P2(z) = z2: [19.3a] shows the vector ﬁeld itself on a circular
loop Cr of radius r, and [19.3b] shows the phase portrait of streamlines. Make sure you can see that
both these diagrams are at least qualitatively correct. (For bonus points, prove that the streamlines
in [19.3b] are indeed perfect circles!)
Although the deﬁnition (19.3) of the index makes essential use of the loop L enclosing the
singular point, we have already seen in (19.4) that the shape and size of L is actually a red herring:
the index is actually a property of the vector ﬁeld at the singular point itself.
To make this idea more vivid, [19.3b] illustrated the loop Cr shrinking towards the singular
point. Clearly, it is the behaviour of the vector ﬁeld in an inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of the singular point
3There is actually a second singular point at inﬁnity; see VCA, page 492.

[19.3] As we traverse the circle in [a] once (positively) round the singular point at 0, P2(z) = z2 executes two

lines) of the ﬂow in [b]. As we shrink Cr down towards the singular point, the index does not change: the index

To sum up, if m is any integer,
Pm(z) = zm
=⇒
I(0) = m.
Figure [19.4] shows these ﬁelds for m = +3, +2, +1, 0, −1, −2. Please take a moment to visually
verify, for each ﬁeld, that (i) it is indeed what it purports to be and (ii) that the index is indeed equal
to the power m.
While we started our discussion of singular points with the intuitive idea of their “character,”
the more precise concept of index has moved us in a new direction. For example, a source, a
vortex, and a sink are, from the physical point of view, all quite different in character, but they are
nevertheless indistinguishable from the topological point of view, for all three have index +1.
This is explained by the following fact: multiplying a complex function f(z) by a complex
constant k = Reiφ has no effect on its indices. For f(z) ; Reiφf(z) stretches the vectors by R and
rotates them by the ﬁxed angle φ. Thus kf(z) executes the same number of revolutions as f(z) as z
traverses any closed loop, and therefore the index remains the same. In particular, if we let f(z) = z
and let φ gradually increase from 0 to (π/2), and then from (π/2) to π, the ﬁeld of the source in
[19.4c] evolves like this: [c] ù [d] ù [e] ù [f].
We end this section with some general observations. First, note that reversing the direction of
any ﬂow has no effect on the location or indices of its singular points. As we traverse a loop around a
singular point, V and −V undergo exactly equal rotations, like the two ends of a compass needle,
so the common singular point of the two vector ﬁelds has the same index for both.

Next, note that if we deﬁne the complex conjugate vector ﬁeld by
Pn(z) = zn = zn,
then the streamlines of Pm(z) are identical to those of P−m(z), so their common singular point at
the origin is a zero for both ﬁelds and has the same index in both ﬁelds.
More generally, for any complex function f(z), the vector ﬁeld f(z) has become known as the
Pólya vector ﬁeld of f(z), in honour of George Pólya (1887–1985). Clearly the Pólya vector ﬁeld
has the same singular points as f(z), but since f(z) has the opposite angle, these common singular
points have opposite indices. The principal virtue of the Pólya vector ﬁeld is that it allows for
simple, intuitive, visual and physical interpretations of the complex contour integral of f(z). For
details, see Chapter 11 of VCA.
Finally, observe that if we take the reciprocal of f(z) then we obtain a new vector ﬁeld 1/f(z)
that goes to inﬁnity (the north pole of the Riemann sphere) at a singular point where f(z) = 0,
and the index of 1/f(z) at such a singular point is [exercise] the negative of that of f(z): this is
particularly clear in the case of Pm(z), for then 1/Pm(z) points in the same direction as P−m(z). If
we now consider the Pólya vector ﬁeld of this reciprocal, namely 1/f(z), the indices are reversed
a second time, and are therefore the same as those of f(z).
NOTES ON THE PHYSICAL TERMINOLOGY. We have borrowed the terms, source, vortex, sink,
dipole, and quadrupole, from physics, to describe the streamlines of z, z2, and z3. While this is
topologically correct, it is not physically correct: the physical ﬁelds corresponding to these terms
are actually the Pólya vector ﬁelds (1/z), (1/z2), and (1/z3).
As explained in the previous paragraph, each of these ﬁelds points in the same direction as
the corresponding positive power, so they have the same singular points and indices, thereby
justifying our use of these terms in the current topological setting. However, the magnitudes of the
physical ﬁelds are the reciprocals of those of the positive powers to which we have attached the
same names.
In an attempt to clear our conscience, let us explain this in the simplest case of a source.
Suppose water is supplied at a constant rate s through a very narrow tube to a point on the sur-
face of a horizontal plane, which we shall take to be C. The water will ﬂow radially outward,
symmetrically, from this source (now used in the physical sense), which we suppose to be at the
origin.
While the radial velocity ﬁeld P1(z) = z = reiθ depicted in [19.4c] has magnitude r, speeding
up as we move away from the origin, it is intuitively clear that the velocity v of the radial ﬂow
from a physical source must slow down the further away the water travels. More precisely, the total
amount of water ﬂowing out across a circle of radius r (per unit time) must equal the amount
being supplied at the origin, namely, s. Thus,

It is easy enough to imagine a vector ﬁeld on a surface, instead of in the plane. Picture any smooth

[19.5] The Honey-Flow.
Honey rains down in the gravitational direction V onto the surface S of a fried
banana. The honey then ﬂows down over its surface, creating the “honey-ﬂow” velocity vector ﬁeld v on
S. The singular points of v occur when the outward normal n of S is n = −V (at p1,2,3), or n = +V (at
p4). Visual intuition suggests that p1 and p2 are sources, with I(p1) = I(p2) = +1, p3 is a saddle point,
with I(p3) = −1, and p4 is a sink, I(p4) = +1. These intuitions are conﬁrmed by the precise deﬁnition,
(19.5).
ground, and its velocity v(p) at each point p ∈S is then an example of a vector ﬁeld on the surface,
the vectors themselves being everywhere tangent to the surface.
While this rain ﬂow v(p) is but one example of a vector ﬁeld on S, we shall see shortly that
this speciﬁc one is a powerful theoretical tool, and the key to a new proof of GGB.
Figure [19.5] illustrates this ﬂow on a particular surface, the direction of the gravitation pull
being V. In reality, the rain water ﬂowing down over this surface might well be pulled off the
surface, falling straight down to the ground as soon as it can, i.e., once the tangent plane becomes
vertical, containing V.
In order to allow physical intuition to continue to inform mathematical intuition, we must
ensure that the ﬂuid adheres to S and always ﬂows over it. We therefore perform a biblical mira-
cle: we turn water into honey! (By way of an ancillary miracle, let us also turn [19.5] into a fried
banana!)
Accordingly, the ﬂow v (resulting from this honey being dragged over the surface by a
force V in space) will henceforth be referred to as the honey-ﬂow vector ﬁeld associated with
V. (WARNINGS: You may be shocked to learn that “honey-ﬂow” is not (yet) standard mathemati-
cal terminology! Also, we shall only pay poetic homage to physics, faithfully keeping track of the
direction of the honey-ﬂow, but not its speed.)

THE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP
[19.6] The Topographic Map of a surface is obtained by intersecting it with equally spaced horizontal planes,
then projecting the resulting level curves vertically downward onto the map plane, Π. (We have not mapped the
bottom half of the surface, to avoid clutter.) The level curve through the saddle point p3 is a ﬁgure eight, of which
only its tangents at p3 are shown (dashed lines). The streamlines of the honey-ﬂow on the surface are orthogonal
to the level curves, and they remain orthogonal after projection down to Π (despite the fact that the map is not
conformal).
19.5.2
Relation of the Honey-Flow to the Topographic Map
We will give a concise, purely mathematical deﬁnition of the honey-ﬂow v in Section 19.7, but, for
now, let us continue to think physically, in order to gain a fresh insight. To that end, recall that we
can represent the shape of the fried banana in [19.5], or any other surface, using a ﬂat topographic
map, of the type used in geography.
To construct this map, we take many equally spaced horizontal planes and look at the curves
on the surface where these planes intersect it, the so-called level curves. Finally, we project these
level curves vertically downward onto the horizontal map plane Π below, thereby creating the
topographic map.
This process is illustrated in [19.6], but only for the upper part of the fried banana; the map of
the bottom half would clutter the diagram, and is therefore best drawn in a separate ﬁgure (not
shown). If the level curves are imagined to exist on a transparent surface, the topographic map is
what you would see if you were to look straight down at the surface from high above. In the case
of the banana in [19.6], you can experimentally verify the map by taking a long knife and slicing
up the banana thinly, then examining the shape of each slice.
Note that when the intersecting plane passes through the saddle point p3, the level curve is
a ﬁgure eight (not shown); the ﬁgure does show the tangents (dashed lines) to this ﬁgure eight

204

Chapter 19 Third (Vector Field) Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
as it passes through p3. Recall that these are the asymptotic directions of the surface, κ = 0, and
that the pattern of hyperbolas in the vicinity of the saddle point is the Dupin Indicatrix there. See
Section 15.8, page 162.
Note also that where the level curves are closest together, the surface of the banana is steepest,
and where they are furthest apart, the surface is shallowest. Moving along a level curve cor-
responds to moving sideways on the surface, at constant height. Moving at right angles to the
level curves therefore corresponds to travelling in the direction of steepest descent (or ascent)
on the surface. Points where (inﬁnitesimally separated) neighbouring curves in the map intersect
correspond to different heights above a single point, i.e., to a vertical tangent plane.
Since the gravitational force pulling the honey down the surface has no horizontal component
(along the level curves), we immediately deduce that the honey-ﬂow on the surface is along the
orthogonal trajectories of the level curves.
This has implications for the topographic map. Since v is orthogonal to the tangent T to
the level curve, it must lie within the plane that is orthogonal to T. But since T is horizontal
(by construction) this orthogonal plane is vertical. Since the vertical planes through T and v are
orthogonal, they intersect the horizontal map plane Π in orthogonal directions. So, as illustrated
in [19.6],
On both the surface and in its topographic map, the streamlines of the honey-ﬂow
are the orthogonal trajectories of the level curves and of the topographic map.
Note that the vertical projection from the surface down to the map is not conformal: in general,
angles on the surface are not faithfully represented in the topographic map. However, despite
this nonconformality, we have just proved that the right angles between the level curves and the
streamlines of the honey-ﬂow are preserved.
If two plane vector ﬁelds are orthogonal, then they must rotate the same amount as we tra-
verse a curve. A shared singular point of the two ﬁelds must therefore have the same index. For
example, in the topographic map, the level curves near either peak of the fried banana look like
the streamlines of a centre vector ﬁeld, with I = +1. Since the streamlines of the honey-ﬂow are
orthogonal to the level curves, it follows that the (projected) honey-ﬂow must have I = +1, too, as
it does.
Likewise, near the saddle point of the fried banana, the level curves look like the streamlines
of a saddle point, with I = −1. It follows that the honey-ﬂow also has a saddle point with I = −1;
recall that this is why it is called a saddle point!
In the case of the honey-ﬂow, we thus have a simple way of ascribing an “index” to each of
its singular points, via the surface’s topographic map. We now turn to a more general analysis of
the concept of the index, directly on the surface itself.
19.5.3
Deﬁning the Index on a Surface
Given any vector ﬁeld on a surface, not necessarily the honey-ﬂow, it seems intuitively clear that
it must be possible to extend our deﬁnition of the index to its singular points.
For example, in [19.5] we immediately identify four singular points of the honey-ﬂow: p1, p2,
p3, and p4. These are the points where the direction of the outward surface normal either coincides
with −V, as at p1,2,3, or else coincides with +V, as at p4. Clearly, the “correct” generalization of
I should be such that p1 and p2 are sources, with I(p1) = I(p2) = +1, p3 is a saddle point, with
I(p3) = −1, and p4 is a sink, with I(p4) = +1.
To give precise meaning to this new, generalized notion of “index,” presumably we should
draw a loop round the singular point on the surface, then ﬁnd the net rotation of the vector ﬁeld
as the loop is traversed. But wait, rotation relative to what?

[19.7] Deﬁning the Index on a Surface. We usually measure the rotation of a plane vector ﬁeld W with respect
to a horizontal ﬁducial (or reference) ﬁeld U, as in [a]. But we may instead measure the rotation with respect
to any other ﬁeld without singular points, such as that in [b]. Finally, in [c], we generalize to surfaces: draw a
regular ﬂow U across the region containing the singular point; then the index is the count of the revolutions of
W relative to U.
To answer this question, we ﬁrst re-examine the familiar concept of rotation in the plane.
Figure [19.7a] illustrates that the rotation of a plane vector ﬁeld W(z) along a loop L can be thought
of as taking place relative to a ﬁducial (or reference) vector ﬁeld U having horizontal streamlines,
say U(z) = 1. If we deﬁne ∠UW to be the angle from U to W, and let δL (∠UW) be the net change
in this angle along L, then our old deﬁnition (19.3) of the index can be written as
IW(s) = 1
2π δL (∠UW).
(19.5)
If we continuously deform the straight horizontal streamlines of U in [19.7a] to produce the
curved ones in [19.7b], then, by the usual reasoning, the right-hand side of (19.5) will not change.
Thus we conclude that this formula yields the correct value of the index if we replace U with any
vector ﬁeld that is nonsingular on and inside L.
Next, imagine that [19.7b] is drawn on a rubber sheet. If we continuously stretch it into the
form of the curved surface in [19.7c], then not only will the right-hand side of (19.5) remain well
deﬁned, but its value will not change.

To summarize, if s is a singular point of a vector ﬁeld W on a surface S, we deﬁne its index as
follows. Draw any nonsingular vector ﬁeld U on a patch of S that covers s but no other singular
points; on this patch, draw a simple loop L going round s; ﬁnally, apply (19.5)—that is, count the
net revolutions of W relative to U as we traverse L.

Figure [19.8] shows the streamlines of two possible ﬂows on the sphere. Notice that both possess

ﬁeld on the sphere that is free of singular points.

This

but
one
conse-
quence of an extremely beauti-
ful and important result, called
the
Poincaré–Hopf
Theorem,
which we will state momentarily.
For now, to get a ﬁrst whiff
of the result, note that if we
sum all the indices in [19.8a] we
obtain
I (centre) + I (centre) = 1 + 1 = 2,
while if we do the same for
[19.8b] we obtain
I (dipole) = 2.
Next, reconsider the four singular points of the honey-ﬂow depicted in [19.5]. Here the sum of the
indices is (1) + (1) + (−1) + (1) = 2, again!
Try drawing your own streamlines on an orange. For example, consider ﬂow from the north
pole along the meridians to the south pole. Summing the indices of the singular points at the
poles,
I (source) + I (sink) = 1 + 1 = 2,
again! Perhaps this is all some bizarre coincidence?
There are no coincidences in mathematics! In the case of the sphere, the Poincaré–Hopf Theo-
rem states that if we sum the indices of any vector ﬁeld on its surface, we will always get 2 for the
answer. Indeed, it says that we will get this answer for any surface that is topologically a sphere,
such as the fried banana in [19.5].
Here is the splendid general result:
Poincaré–Hopf Theorem: If a vector ﬁeld v on a smooth surface Sg of genus g
has only a ﬁnite number of singular points, pi, then the sum of their indices equals
the Euler characteristic of the surface:
∑
i Iv(pi) = χ(Sg) = 2 −2g.

[19.9] A ﬂow without singular points can only exist on a topo-
logical doughnut. Here are two such regular (topologically
distinct) ﬂows on the torus: white and black.
An immediate consequence of
(19.6) is that a vector ﬁeld without
any singular points can exist only on
a surface of vanishing Euler charac-
teristic, i.e., a topological doughnut.
Even then, the theorem does not
actually guarantee that such a vector
ﬁeld must exist, it merely demands
that the indices of any singular points
on a topological doughnut sum to
zero. Nevertheless, we can easily see
that on a doughnut there do exist vec-
tor ﬁelds without any singular points:
[19.9] illustrates two such ﬁelds, one
shown with white arrows, the other
with black arrows.
All the streamlines in the white
ﬂow are topologically equivalent to
each other, for any one can be continuously deformed into any other. The same is true for the
black ﬂow. However, the white and black ﬂows are topologically distinct from each other: no white
streamline can be deformed into a black streamline.
If we were to “add” these two ﬂows, we could imagine a third, topologically distinct regular
ﬂow, such that each streamline went once around the doughnut and once through the hole before
joining up again.
More generally, we can construct inﬁnitely many, topologically distinct, regular ﬂows, such
that each closed streamline does m (white) circuits around the axis of symmetry, and n (black)
circuits through the hole, before closing up on itself. “Adding” such an (m, n)-ﬂow to an
(m′, n′)-ﬂow, by joining the end of one streamline to the start of the other, then yields the
(m + m′, n + n′)-ﬂow. This idea leads naturally to what topologists call the fundamental group
of the surface, discovered by Poincaré in 1895. But we digress!
19.6.2
Proof of the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem
We can now give a very elegant derivation of the theorem (19.6), due to Heinz Hopf himself (see
Hopf 1956, p. 13). The argument proceeds in two steps. First, we show that on a surface of given
genus, all vector ﬁelds yield the same value for the sum of their indices. Second, we produce a
concrete example4 of a vector ﬁeld for which the sum equals the Euler characteristic. This proves
the result.
Consider the surface S in [19.10], and suppose that X and Y are two different vector ﬁelds on
S; to avoid clutter, we have only drawn these ﬁelds at a single point. If • are the singular points of
X, and ⊙are those of Y, we must show that
∑
•
IX [•] =
∑
⊙
IY [⊙].
We begin by partitioning S into curvilinear polygons (dashed curves) such that each one contains
at most one • and one ⊙.
Now concentrate on just one of these polygons (darkly shaded) and its boundary Kj, taken
counterclockwise as viewed from outside S. To ﬁnd the indices of the singular points of X and Y
4We shall actually give a different example than Hopf gave in the reference (Hopf 1956) above.

within Kj, draw any nonsingular ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U (again only shown at a single point) on
the polygon, and then use (19.5). The difference of these indices is then

which is explicitly independent of the local ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U; it depends only upon the
illustrated (signed) angle from X to Y.

[19.10] The difference of the indices of the singular
points of X (marked •) and of Y (marked ⊙) inside Kj
depends only on the rotation of Y relative to X. But each
edge of Kj abuts an oppositely directed edge of a neigh-
bouring polygon, so the sum of these rotations over all
polygons must vanish.
Finally, from this we deduce that

because (see (19.2)) every edge of every poly-
gon is traversed once in each direction, produc-
ing equal and opposite changes in the (signed)
angle ∠XY. We have thus completed the ﬁrst
step: the sum of the indices is independent
of the vector ﬁeld.
Since the index sum for the examples
in [19.8] is 2, we now know that this is the
value for every vector ﬁeld on a topologi-
cal sphere. The second step of the general
argument is likewise to produce a concrete
example on a surface Sg, of arbitrary genus
g, such that the sum is χ(Sg) = (2 −2g).
Figure [19.11] is such an example (here with
g = 3)—namely, our old friend the honey-ﬂow vector ﬁeld. As the ﬁgure explains, the source at the
top and the sink at the bottom each have I = +1, and each of the g holes has two saddle points,
each with I = −1. Thus the sum of the indices of this particular ﬂow is indeed 2 −2g = χ(Sg), and
so this must be the sum of the indices for every ﬂow on Sg. Done.
19.6.3
Application: Proof of the Euler–L’Huilier Formula
The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem provides a stunningly immediate proof of the Euler–L’Huilier For-
mula, (18.7). Recall that the latter states that if we partition a surface Sg of genus g into polygons,
with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, then
V −E + F = 2 −2g.
As [19.12] illustrates, we may construct a consistent Stiefel vector ﬁeld5 on Sg as follows:
place a source (marked ⃝) at each of the V vertices, a saddle point (marked ⊙) on each of the

ﬁeld on Sg by placing a source (⃝)—think white hole!—at each of the V vertices, a saddle point (⊙) on each

Poincaré’s Differential Equations Versus Hopf’s Line Fields
The 2-dimensional Poincaré–Hopf Theorem, as stated, was actually discovered by Poincaré. How-
ever, Hopf’s name is correctly attached, for he enormously extended the result in two distinct
directions. The ﬁrst direction was to generalize the result to vector ﬁelds on n-dimensional closed
manifolds; sadly, to explain this would take us too far aﬁeld, but see Further Reading. However,
the second direction in which Hopf extended the result is quite elementary, and we shall explain
it now.
Poincaré was led to investigate the topological behaviour of vector ﬁelds by his pioneering
work on the qualitative theory of differential equations. Such equations became central to physics
in 1687, when Newton announced his Second Law of Motion: if a point particle with position
vector X, and of mass m, is subjected to a vector force F, then it responds by accelerating in the
direction of the force, according to this law:
..
X = acceleration = 1
mF.
(19.7)
Newton’s motivation in formulating this law was the determination of the orbits of the planets—
part of what is now called Celestial Mechanics. As we discussed in the Prologue, in later life
Newton shunned his own youthful discoveries in symbolic calculus, and in the Principia he
instead employed elegant geometrical reasoning to determine the orbit of a planet, given the known
(inverse square) law of the Sun’s gravitational force acting upon it.
However, from the more traditional, modern point of view, (19.7) is simply a second-order
differential equation, which may be solved (in principle) by integrating twice: once to ﬁnd the
velocity .
X, and a second time to ﬁnd the orbit X itself. In the case of just two gravitating bodies
(such as the Earth and Sun) Newton found the exact solution. By introducing the Moon as a third
body, Newton was able to explain the tides on Earth, and by making approximations, he was able
to make predictions about the variations of the tides. But Newton and his successors were unable
to ﬁnd an exact solution to this 3-body problem.
Finally, more than 200 years later, Poincaré—pictured in [19.13]—made decisive progress by
proving that the 3-body problem was insoluble.6 Of course matters only get much worse if we try
to analyze the entire solar system, in which each planet is not only held in its orbit by the Sun,
but also attracts every other planet, and they mutually determine their collective orbits. This is the
so-called n-body problem.
It is ﬁtting (and perhaps somewhat ironic) that it was Poincaré’s return to geometrical meth-
ods that secured the greatest advance in Celestial Mechanics since Newton. In three volumes
(published in 1892, 1893, and 1899), Poincaré published his New Methods of Celestial Mechan-
ics,7 in which he no longer sought to explicitly solve the differential equations (which he had
shown to be impossible), but rather to determine the qualitative behaviour of the solutions of these
equations.

Poincaré did, ﬁrst-order differential equa-
tions in the (x, y)-plane, of the form

Poincaré actually wrote these as
P(x, y) dx + Q(x, y) dy = 0.

yields the saddle point in [19.4h], and

yields either a source or a
sink, [19.4c,f].
Now let us turn to Hopf’s extensions of Poincaré’s discovery. In addition to generalizing to n-
dimensional vector ﬁelds, which required fundamentally new ideas, Hopf realized that even in 2
dimensions there exist what we might call “directionless ﬂows” that do not arise from differential
equations of the type considered by Poincaré.
For our ﬁrst example, consider [19.14a]. We have called such a pattern a “directionless ﬂow,”
but Hopf actually named this concept a ﬁeld of line elements. However, the modern terminology,
which we shall adopt going forward, is line ﬁeld, by analogy with vector ﬁeld.
As you see, no arrows are attached to these “streamlines,” but we may nevertheless assign a
continuously varying angle Θ to the tangent line. If we travel along a simple loop L around the
singular point s, the illustrated line element must return to it original position. Previously, with
vector ﬁelds, the vector had to return home pointing in the same direction as when it left, and
therefore it had to undergo a complete number of revolutions: the rotation was necessarily a multiple of
2π, that multiple being the index.

[19.14] Line Fields do not have a direction associated with their “streamlines.” As a consequence, their singular
points can have fractional indices, which vector ﬁelds cannot have. By repeating the patterns in [c] and [C], we
may construct a singular point of arbitrary positive or negative index, respectively. If the positive integer n is odd,
the index is a fraction, but if n is even then we recover the ﬂows of the vector ﬁelds shown in [19.4], for which
the indices are integers.

19.6 The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem
•
213
But a line element will return to its original orientation if it undergoes a rotation through any
multiple of π. Indeed, in [19.14a] we see that the net rotation is π. If we retain our original deﬁnition
of the index, (19.3), as the rotation divided by 2π, then we see that this singular point has a fractional
index: I = + 1
2. Some authors call such fractional indices, Hopf indices.
Please look through all the remaining ﬁgures in [19.14] and visually conﬁrm their indices.
In particular, [19.14c] and [19.14C] show how to construct a singular point of arbitrary positive
or negative index, respectively, simply by repeating the illustrated patterns until they completely
surround the singular point. If n is odd, the index is a fraction, but if n is even then we recover the
ﬂows of the vector ﬁelds shown in [19.4], for which the index is an integer.
a

c
[19.15] By installing a barrier that connects
a and b, we can create a ﬂow that encircles
both points, and that has a third singular point
at the centre c. The index sum is still equal to
the Euler characteristic, despite the fractional
indices at a and b.
Although we cannot interpret a line ﬁeld with
fractional index as the streamlines of an unob-
structed ﬂow, we can instead interpret it as a ﬂow
in the presence of 1-dimensional barriers. For example,
in [19.14a], if we think of the horizontal ray to the
right of s as such a barrier, then we can attach arrows
to the curves in a manner that is consistent with a
ﬂow around this barrier, ﬂowing to the left above the
barrier, say, and to the right below it.
From this perspective, every point of the barrier
is a singular point of the vector ﬁeld, for the direc-
tion of the vector ﬂips discontinuously as we cross
the barrier. However, for the illustrated, direction-
less line ﬁeld, every such point p (other than s) is
a regular point. For if K is a small loop around p,
then you can see that Θ varies continuously on K,
so I(p) = 1
2πδKΘ = 0.
Now think back over the reasoning that cul-
minated in the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem, concerning
the singular points of vector ﬁelds. You will discover
that it is all equally applicable to these more general
line ﬁelds. In short,
The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem (19.6) not only applies to vector ﬁelds, but also to
line ﬁelds, with fractional indices.
(19.9)
Figure [19.15] is an example of this result on the sphere. Here we see a line ﬁeld with three
singular points, a, b, and c. We have imagined that the curve connecting a and b is a barrier, and
we have added arrows to the curves to create a consistent ﬂow that circulates around this barrier.
Note that the ﬂow near a and b is the one shown in [19.14a], with I = +(1/2).
The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem (19.6) predicts that the sum of the indices on a sphere should be
χ = 2, and indeed it is:
I(a) + I(b) + I(c) = 1
2 + 1
2 + 1 = 2.
Finally, note that if we shrink the length of the barrier and allow the two I = (1/2) singular
points a and b to approach one another, then they will ultimately coalesce into a single I = 1 centre,
creating the ﬂow shown in [19.8a].
THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF LINE FIELDS: Despite the fact that Hopf gave a wonderfully
lucid account of his ideas in Hopf (1956), I am not aware of any modern introductory text on
Topology, Differential Topology, or Differential Geometry that even mentions this fascinating con-
cept. Indeed, the only example we have found is now more than 50 years old: the classic text by

Chapter 19 Third (Vector Field) Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Stoker (1969, p. 244), who was a doctoral student of Hopf. This is despite the fact that such line
ﬁelds arise naturally in mathematics. For example, the lines of curvature surrounding an umbilic
point on a surface (where κ1 = κ2) typically take the form [19.14 a or A]. For a lovely illustration
of case [a], see Hilbert (1952, p. 189).
While mathematicians seem to have paid scant attention to the applicability of the Poincaré–
Hopf Theorem to line ﬁelds with fractional indices, the same is not true of physicists, for Nature
herself has thrust such line ﬁelds upon them in multiple areas of physics, but especially in optics.
The Further Reading section at the end of this book seeks to guide you to many of these fascinating
new physical applications of Hopf’s idea.
19.7
Vector Field Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Let V be an arbitrary point on S2, with unit position vector V. Now imagine a plane with normal
V, initially located far from a smooth closed surface S, and with V pointing away from S. Next,
imagine the plane moving towards S. Eventually the plane must make contact with S, and at that
moment it will become the tangent plane to S at the point(s) p of contact, and therefore V must
coincide with the surface normal there: V = n(p). In other words, V is the spherical image of p:
V = n(p). Since this is true for arbitrary V, it must also be true of opposite vector, −V; the plane
simply approaches from the other side of S. To sum up,
If S is an arbitrary, closed, smooth surface, then its spherical image covers every
antipodal pair of points ±V of S2 at least once.
(19.10)
Of course, V and −V may each be covered more than once. For example, in [19.5] we see that V is
covered once, while −V is covered three times.
Let us now to return to GGB, and let us brieﬂy recap our very ﬁrst “heuristic” proof in Chap-
ter 17. Look at these coverings of V from the point of view of the total curvature, K(S). If K(p) > 0
at p, then n preserves the orientation of a small patch of area δA surrounding p, so its spherical
image of area δ e
A ≍K(p) δA surrounding V on S2 has the same orientation. As we discussed in
Section 17.4, we count this as a positive covering of V. Likewise, if K(p) < 0, then the spherical map
reverses the orientation, and the covering is counted as negative. The total curvature integral auto-
matically counts these coverings algebraically, taking into account orientation. As earlier, let P(V)
and N(V) denote the number of positive and negative coverings of V, respectively, so that the net
number of coverings of V is [P(V) −N(V)]. Thus,
Let V be a point on S2, and let its preimages (under the spherical map n) be the
points pi of S. Consider a small (ultimately vanishing) patch around V (with area
δ e
A) and let the areas of the small preimage patches around pi be δAi. Then,
Total curvature within the δAi ≍∑
i K(pi) δAi ≍[P(V) −N(V)] δ e
A.
(19.11)
For example, in [19.5] we see that the curvatures at p1 and p2 are positive, and the coverings
of −V originating from these points are positive. On the other hand, the negatively curved patch
containing p3 is mapped to an orientation-reversed, negative covering of −V. The net algebraic
count of the coverings of −V is therefore 1. Likewise, the net number of coverings of V is 1.

19.7 Vector Field Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
•
215
Recall that this net number of coverings of S2 is the topological degree deg(n) of the spherical
mapping, and the fundamental fact is that the degree is the same for all8 points of S2. This was the
essence of our heuristic explanation of GGB in Chapter 17. The ﬁnal step of that explanation was
the recognition that the degree depends solely on the genus g of Sg. This is (16.7), on page 174,
which we restate here:
deg [n(Sg)] = P −N = (1 −g) = 1
2 χ(Sg).
(19.12)
As we noted in Section 16.6, this was ﬁrst proved by Walther Dyck in 1888.
If we take it as given that the topological degree exists, so that every point of S2 is covered
the same (algebraic) number of times, then the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem can be used to give an
elegant proof of Dyck’s result, and, with it, GGB. Indeed, this is the approach to GGB taken in
such well-known works as Guillemin and Pollack (1974, p. 198).
We too shall reproduce that argument shortly. However, the existence of the topological
degree is by no means obvious, so we now present a slightly different argument that does not
depend upon it. The argument stills hinges on the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem, but it does not assume
the existence of the topological degree. That is, if V and W are two points of S2, we shall not assume
that they must be covered the same number of times (algebraically); instead, we shall entertain at
least the possibility that deg [n(S), V] ̸= deg [n(S), W]. Henceforth, we shall take it as understood
that we are dealing with the spherical map of S, so this (hypothetical and in fact impossible)
nonequality can then be abbreviated to deg [V] ̸= deg [W].

[19.16] The honey-ﬂow v on the surface S in the
direction V is the orthogonal project of V onto the
tangent plane Tp at p.
To prove GGB without assuming the exis-
tence of the topological degree, reconsider the
honey-ﬂow in [19.5]. The ﬁrst important obser-
vation is that the singular points of this ﬂow
occur at precisely those points where the verti-
cal gravitational force V has zero component
within the surface—that is, at points where
the vertical force vector points directly into (or
out of) the surface—that is, where the outward
surface normal n = ±V. Of course, mathemat-
ically speaking, there is nothing special about
this gravitational direction V—we may imag-
ine gravity pulling in an arbitrary direction;
alternatively, if we do not wish to tamper with
the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, we may simply
rotate the surface!
To put this more mathematically, our
“honey-ﬂow” vector ﬁeld is obtained by orthogonal projection of V onto the surface, or, more
precisely, onto the tangent plane Tp of the surface. See [19.16]. Let us make this deﬁnition
ofﬁcial:
The honey-ﬂow vector ﬁeld in the direction V is
v(p) ≡projTpV.
(19.13)
8As we have discussed, the exceptions are points of vanishing curvature, which contribute nothing to the total curvature.

[19.17] The singular points of the honey-ﬂow v on S in the direction V are mapped by the spherical map n
to either +V or −V on S2, and the orientation of the covering on S2 is determined by the sign of the index
of v on S. Here +V is covered once, positively, by the image of the sink at the bottom of the banana—where
I = +1 and K > 0. On the other hand, −V is covered three times: twice positively by the images of the two
sources—where I = +1 and K > 0—and once negatively by the image of the saddle point—where I = −1 and
K < 0.
The singular points v(pi) = 0 occur when n(pi) = ±V. In other words,
If honey ﬂows over S, pulled in the direction V in space, the singular points of
the honey-ﬂow v consist of the complete set of points that are sent by the spherical
map to either V or to the antipodal point −V on S2.
Out of all possible vector ﬁelds on a surface, why have we lavished so much attention on
the honey-ﬂow? The answer is that there exists a crucial link between the geometry of the surface,
and the topology of the honey-ﬂow. This in turn will yield our third explanation of GGB, as a
consequence of the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem.
Reconsider the singular points pi of the honey-ﬂow vector ﬁeld v illustrated in [19.5]. These
are shown again in [19.17], but now focusing attention on how the spherical map n sends them
to S2.
The decisive observation is the distinction between the singular points of v that have positive
curvature, and those that have negative curvature.
Recall (12.9) and [12.7], on page 136. If K(pi) > 0, the surface is locally a dome facing either
straight up (in which case it is a source with I(pi) = +1) or straight down (in which case it is a
sink, again with I(pi) = +1). But if K(pi) < 0, then the surface is locally a saddle, producing a
corresponding saddle point in the ﬂow, in which case I(pi) = −1.
This immediately implies that the spherical map preserves orientation if I(pi) = +1, and
reverses it if I(pi) = −1:

19.7 Vector Field Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
•
217
If p is a singular point of the honey-ﬂow v, then its image (±V) under the
spherical map n is covered positively if I(p) = +1, and negatively if I(p) = −1.
Now let us combine this result with the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem. If pi is the set of singular
points of v on S, i.e., those whose spherical image is either +V or −V, then
χ(S) =
∑
i
Iv(pi) = {P(+V) −N(+V)} + {P(−V) −N(−V)} .
(19.14)
In reality, both bracketed terms on the right are equal to each other, being the topological
degree of the spherical map. See (19.12). For example, in [19.17] we see that
P(+V) −N(+V) = 1 −0 = 1
and
P(−V) −N(−V) = 2 −1 = 1.
However, (19.14) enables to prove GGB without assuming this fact. To do so, note that the
singular points of the single ﬂow v, corresponding to honey ﬂowing in the direction V, actually
include the singular points of both V and −V. For reversing the direction of the honey ﬂow does
not alter the locations of the singular points, nor their indices.
Now if V roams over just the northern hemisphere of S2 (the area of which is 2π) then −V
roams over the southern hemisphere, and therefore ±V covers the entire S2. Thus, by virtue of
(19.10), as V roams over just the northern hemisphere, the singular points of v cover the entire
surface S. And since we have just seen that the indices of the singular points correctly count the
covers of their images under the spherical map, (19.11) and (19.14) yield our third proof of GGB,
in the form
K(S) = 2π χ(S).
Let us return to the topic of the topological degree, and thereby obtain a bonus result. If
we assume that the topological degree exists, then deg(V) = deg(W), for all V and W on S2. In
particular, it follows that deg(+V) = deg(−V). In that case, (19.14) becomes,
χ(S)
=
{P(+V) −N(+V)} + {P(−V) −N(−V)}
=
deg(+V) + deg(−V)
=
2 deg(V)
=
2 deg,
in which the ﬁnal equality reﬂects the fact that the degree is independent of the choice of V. Thus,
if we assume the existence of the topological degree, we recover Dyck’s result, (19.12):
deg = 1
2 χ(S).

The Road Ahead
All three of the proofs of GGB thus far presented have relied upon the interpretation of K as
the local area expansion factor of the spherical map. This is an extrinsic conception of curvature,
depending as it does upon the normal n, which is invisible and unknowable to the inhabitants of
S. While the three proofs have afforded us wonderful new insights in many different directions,
something is lacking, for we know that K is also, in fact, an intrinsic property of the surface,
knowable to and measurable by its inhabitants. In principle, these inhabitants could measure K
throughout the surface, and from these purely local geometric measurement they could determine
the topology of their world!
We are about to embark on Act IV, which introduces a brand new, and extremely powerful,
intrinsic way of understanding and measuring curvature. This will allow us to ﬁnally explain
some of the fundamental results we have been forced to assume up till now, such as the Local
Gauss–Bonnet Theorem—and with it the Theorema Egregium—as well as the remarkable (“Star
Trek phaser”) formula (4.10), page 38, for the curvature in terms of the metric. Furthermore, it will
allow us to remedy the noted deﬁciency in our three existing proofs of GGB. Indeed, using an idea
of Heinz Hopf, we shall ﬁnally be able to provide a proof of GGB that is entirely intrinsic.

Curvature of Plane Curves
1. Computational Proof of the Curvature Formula. Figure [8.7] provided a geometric proof of
(8.7). Prove this instead by calculation. (Hint: If the curve [x(t), y(t)] is traced at unit speed,
then.x = cos φ, and .y = sin φ.)

2. Binormal Cannot Tip in the Direction of Motion. Prove by calculation that as the Frenet
frame (T, N, B) moves along its curve, the binormal B only spins around T; it cannot tip in
the direction of T. (Hint: Symbolically, what must be proved is that B′ has no component in
the T direction: B′·T = 0.)
3. The Darboux Vector. As the Frenet frame moves along its curve, it rotates. Verify by cal-
culation that its instantaneous angular velocity vector is
A ≡τ T + κ B.
This vector A is sometimes referred to as the Darboux vector (see Stoker 1969, p. 62) in honour
of its discoverer, Jean-Gaston Darboux (1842–1917), a pioneer of Differential Geometry, and a
teacher of Cartan. Hint: Use (9.3) to prove that

6. The Frenet–Serret Approximation to a Curve. Let x(t) be the position at time t of a particle
that traces a curve C in space at unit speed. Let (T0, N0, B0) be the Frenet–Serret frame at time
t = 0, and let κ0 and τ0 be the curvature and torsion at this time.

The Principal Curvatures of a Surface
7. Series Expansion of Surfaces. For each of the following equations, use a computer to draw
the surface. Use series expansions to calculate the quadratic approximation near the origin,
then use (10.6), page 111, to deduce the principal curvatures and K there. Visually conﬁrm
that your calculations are at least qualitatively correct.
(i) z = exp(x2 + 4y2) −1.
(ii) z = ln cos y −ln cos 2x.
8. Variable-Speed Formulas for the Curvature of a Surface of Revolution. In the text, we pic-
tured a particle moving at constant unit speed along the generating curve of a surface of
revolution, in which case the principal curvatures are given by (10.11) and (10.12). If the speed
v(t) is not held constant, recall that (10.11) becomes (8.6):

(iii) If the particle only moves to the right, never retracing any x-value, then we are free
to adjust the speed along the curve so that x represents time: x(t) = t, in which case
y(t) = y(x), and the time derivative becomes the x-derivative: .y = y′. Show that the

9. Polar Formula for the Curvature of a Surface of Revolution. In the previous exercise, the
surface of revolution was deﬁned using the distance of the generating curve from the rotation
axis, which was taken to be the x-axis. Let us now, instead, describe such a surface by giving
its height above a plane perpendicular to its axis of symmetry, which we now take to be the
z-axis. If r is the usual polar coordinate in the (x, y)-plane, consider the surface of revolution
z = f(r).
(i) By simply changing names appropriately, and using the chain rule, show that (20.1)
becomes

(ii) Find f(r) for a sphere or radius R centred at the origin. Check that the formula in (i) gives
the correct value of K.
(iii) Manually sketch the surface z = exp[−r2/2], calculate K, and ﬁnd the regions of posi-
tive, negative, and zero curvature. (A computer-generated graph of the surface should
visually conﬁrm your answers.)
10. In the text we noted that it is visually evident that the surface z = r4 has a planar point (with
K = 0) at the origin, and that the surface has positive curvature everywhere else. Prove this is
correct by using the formula in the previous question to calculate K(r).
Gauss’s Theorema Egregium
11. Why Paper Folds into a Straight Line. We take it for granted that when we fold a piece of
paper, the fold automatically forms itself into a straight line, but why does this happen? Show
(without any calculation) that this is a direct consequence of the Theorema Egregium! (I owe
this delightful insight to my colleague Dr. Robert Wolf, a former student of Chern.)

12. Visual Linear Algebra. Do all of the following by reasoning directly and geometrically about
the linear transformations themselves, not by applying the “Devil’s machine” (see Prologue)

encounter Linear Algebra.

Chapter 20 Exercises for Act III
(i) Verify that the geometric interpretation [15.4] of the SVD generalizes to R3, and therefore
the interpretation [15.5] of MT does too.
NOTE: Although visualization becomes harder, the same is true in Rn.
(ii) Recall that an orthogonal linear transformation is one that preserves lengths, and there-
fore angles (in general), and orthogonality (in particular)—examples include rotations
and reﬂections. In R3, use (i) to explain why any orthogonal transformation R has the
property that R−1 = RT .
(iii) Recall that a matrix [M] is called skew symmetric if [M]T = −[M]. In R2, use (15.12)
to give a geometric characterization (in terms of the twist, τ) of the underlying skew-
symmetric linear transformation M.
(iv) A symmetric linear transformation P is called positive deﬁnite if x·(Px) > 0, for all x. Use
(15.13) to show that P is positive deﬁnite if (and only if) all of its eigenvalues are positive.
(v) Arguing directly, or, alternatively, building on (iv), show that a symmetric, positive-
deﬁnite linear transformation must have positive determinant (and hence be invertible).
Show that the converse is false, by ﬁnding a simple counterexample in R3. (Hint: Geomet-
rically, the determinant is the (signed) volume-expansion factor of the linear transformation,
the sign being postive (+) or negative (−) according to whether orientation is preserved
or reversed, respectively.)
(vi) Given (iv) above, it follows from (15.15) that MT M and MMT are always symmet-
ric and positive deﬁnite. Conversely, show that any symmetric, positive-deﬁnite linear
transformation P can be factorized as P = MT M, in inﬁnitely many ways.
(vii) Building on (vi), show that just as any positive number has a real square root, so any
positive-deﬁnite linear transformation P has a square root Q, such that P = Q2. In greater
detail, show that Q = R−1DR, where R is orthogonal, and [D] is the diagonal matrix
whose entries are the square roots of the eigenvalues of P.
(viii) A symmetric linear transformation S is called positive semideﬁnite if x·(Sx) ⩾0, for all
x. If M is any linear transformation of R3, show that M = RS, where R is orthogonal, and
S is symmetric and positive semideﬁnite. This is called the Polar Decomposition of M.
13. Vanishing Shape Operator ⇐⇒Flat. Show, both geometrically and by calculation, that if the
Shape Operator vanishes identically, then the surface is a portion of a plane.
14. Gaussian Curvature in terms of the Shape Operator. If u and v are short tangent vectors
at a point p on a surface with Shape Operator S, show geometrically that S(u) × S(v) =
K(p) [u × v]. (NOTE: The equation itself is valid even if the tangent vectors are not short, but
the geometric explanation relies on thinking in terms of ultimate equalities.)
15. Cartesian Formulas for the Shape Operator, Curvature, and Mean Curvature.
Let Tp be the tangent plane of a general surface S at a point p. Introduce Cartesian coordinates
(x, y) into Tp, and take p = (0, 0), so that the normal n there points along the z-axis. Then,
locally, S is given by
z = f(x, y)
where
f(0, 0) = 0
and
Bxf = 0 = Byf at (0, 0).
(i) Note that if we deﬁne F(x, y, z) ≡f(x, y) −z, then F is constant on S. Deduce that ∇F is
normal to S, and therefore,

16. Nonprincipal Coordinates. Let us reanalyze the saddle surface, this time without ﬁrst

(i) Sketch the surface z = xy near the origin. (Hint: Recalling that sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ, ﬁnd
the height of the surface above and below the points of the origin-centred circle of
radius r, for which x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ.)
(ii) Use (10.4), p. 111, to identity the principal directions.

(vi) Guided by either (ii) or (v), rotate the (x, y)-axes to obtain new (X, Y)-axes aligned
with the principal directions, and show that the original equation now becomes, z = 1

(X2 −Y2).
(vii) By comparing the new equation in (v) with (10.6), page 111, conﬁrm the values of K and

K and κ have not changed.

transformation S) conform to the general matrix formula (15.20), page 161.

19. Nonisometric Surfaces with Equal Curvatures. As we discussed in Act I, Minding proved
that if two surfaces have the same constant K, then they are locally isometric to each other.
Thus, according as this constant curvature K > 0, K = 0, K < 0, the surface is locally isometric
to a sphere, plane, or pseudosphere, respectively. We now provide an example to show that
the converse is false.
(i) Using the same notation as in the previous exercise, ﬁnd the shapes of these two surfaces:
S1 with f1(r, θ) = ln r, and S2 with f2(r, θ) = θ. (Hint: S2 is called the helicoid.) Check your
answers by using a computer to draw them.
(ii) Let us say that a point in S1 and a point in S2 “correspond” if they have the same (r, θ)-
coordinates. By ﬁnding the formulas for the metrics of both surfaces, show that this
correspondence is not an isometry.
(iii) Nevertheless, use (20.4) to deduce that corresponding points of the two surfaces have
the same curvature!

22. Holy Broken Gauss–Bonnet, Batman! Recall our deﬁnition of a wormhole in [16.7], and also

(i) If n small bagels are placed at the vertices of a large regular n-gon, and are joined
together with wormhole connectors along the edges of the n-gon into a surface S, explain
why K(S) = −4πn. Why is this not a violation of GGB, as it appears to be?
(ii) Suppose n = 4, so that the bagels are at the corners of a square, joined along the four
edges. Now add a ﬁfth wormhole connector along one of the diagonals, connecting two
previously disconnected bagels. What is the total curvature now, and why is this not a
violation of GGB, as it appears to be?
First (Heuristic) Proof of GGB
23. Hopf’s Umlaufsatz. Let us attempt to reduce Hopf’s (1935) ingenious argument to its essence.
Imagine that the (smooth and “simple”) closed curve C of the theorem is a convoluted
hiking/running path snaking through sand dunes. See map below. The entrance is at the
southern-most point (downward on the page); the rest of C lies to the north (upwards). As
illustrated, let Θ(t) be the angle of the line L(t) connecting you (⊚) and your friend, Mary
(⊛), at time t. Initially, Mary is standing next to you, so L(0) (dashed line) is horizontal, with
Θ(0) = 0.

(i) Mary decides to do a warm-up lap, but you stay at the start and just watch her run. As
she runs the length of C, counterclockwise, you turn your head to follow. Explain why
your line of sight L(t) must execute a net rotation of π by the time Mary returns to you:
δΘ = π. Next, Mary stays put and rests while you run a lap, so L rotates another π. Thus,
after you and Mary have each run one lap, L has executed one full revolution: δΘ = 2π.
(ii) Next, Mary runs another lap, but this time you don’t wait till she ﬁnishes before you start
to move. You start walking very slowly along the track behind her. You only cover a small
distance before Mary has returned to the start line. Once she’s there, you jog along the
remainder of the path back to her. Explain why the net rotation of L must still be δΘ = 2π.
(iii) Next, you decide to race Mary, despite the fact that she always wins. Sure enough, you
never even get close. Explain why the net rotation of L after you and Mary have each

and picture the continuous evolution of the graph of Θ(t): (i) ù (ii) ù (iii).)
(iv) You decide to have a ﬁnal race, and this time you give it all you’ve got, and you succeed
in staying right on Mary’s heels the whole time. As you stare at her back, eyes front along
the path, your line of sight L is now the tangent line to C. And since the net rotation of L
must still be δΘ = 2π, Hopf’s proof is complete!
Second (Angular Excess) Proof of GGB
24. There Are Only Five Regular Polyhedra. If each face of a regular polyhedron is a regular
n-gon, and m such faces meet at each vertex, use the following steps to show that the only
possibilities are the ﬁve Platonic solids illustrated in [18.2], namely, (n, m) = (3, 3) or (4, 3) or
(3, 4) or (5, 3) or (3, 5).
(i) Explain why m ⩾3.
(ii) If θn is the internal angle of the regular n-gon face, explain why mθn < 2π. (Hint: Imag-

(iii) Write down θn for n = 3, 4, 5, 6 and exhaust the possibilities.
25. There Are Only Five Topologically Regular Polyhedra. Let us use the same (n, m) notation
as in the previous exercise, only now the faces of our topological polyhedron can be curved,

edges, and faces.
(i) Explain why V = Fn/2.
(ii) Explain why E = Fn/m.

F =

2(m + n) −mn.
(iv) Deduce that Ω(n, m) ≡2(m + n) −mn > 0.
(v) Think of (n, m) as grid points in R2. In the relevant region (n ⩾3 and m ⩾3), mark each
grid point with the value Ω(m, n), noting and using the symmetry about the line n = m.
(vi) Deduce that the only solutions (n, m) are the same ones we found in the previous
exercise: the ﬁve Platonic solids, but now topologically deformed.
This result is due to Simon Antoine Jean L’Huilier (1811). See Robin Wilson in James 1999,
page 516.
26. Legendre’s Projection of Convex Polyhedra. As noted in the text, Legendre’s proof of
Euler’s Polyhedral Formula assumed that the polyhedron was convex. The proof we pre-
sented did not require this assumption, but Legendre’s assumption of convexity gave him
an elegant advantage: it allowed him to instantly jump from the original polyhedron P to
a topologically equivalent geodesic polygonal partition of the sphere (see [18.7]), as follows.
Imagine that the convex polyhedron P is a wire frame, and a light bulb B is placed somewhere
inside it. If S is a sphere centred at B and enclosing P, prove that the shadow of the frame on
the sphere is the desired geodesic partition.

27. Hopf’s Proof That χ(Sg)= 2 −2g. In the text, we proved χ(Sg) = 2 −2g by ﬁrst showing that
χ(S2) = 2, and then showing that gluing on a “Toblerone® handle” (see [18.9]) reduces χ by 2
(see [18.10]). Here is an elegant alternative argument, due to Hopf (1956, pp. 8–10).
(i) Glue together two Toblerone® handles to create a topological torus, S1, and deduce that
χ(S1) = 0.
(ii) Remove one triangle from this torus, and remove one triangle from a general surface Sg
of genus g. Now glue the edges of the two triangular holes to each other, thereby creating
a new closed surface Sg+1 of one higher genus. Deduce that χ(Sg+1) = χ(Sg) −2.
(iii) Use (i) and (ii) to deduce that χ(S2) = 2, and that χ(Sg) = 2 −2g.
28. Dual Polyhedra. Place a vertex in the centre of each face of a cube, and join them together to
create an octahedron; this is the dual of the cube, each face having become a vertex, and each
vertex having become a face. What if we keep going, by taking the dual of the octahedron,
i.e., the dual of the dual of the cube? With the assistance of [18.2], repeat this exercise for the
three remaining Platonic solids.

lar to the page, so that the holes are aligned horizontally, instead of vertically. Sketch the new
honey-ﬂow, and deduce that there are a total of 6g −2 singular points. Conﬁrm that the sum
of their indices is indeed χ = 2 −2g, in accord with the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem.
31. Existence of the Stiefel Vector Field. Explain, as explicitly as possible, why the construction
in [19.12] is guaranteed to create a consistent vector ﬁeld on Sg, regardless of the speciﬁc
partition into polygons.
32. A Vector Field on Sg with One Singular Point? The dipole ﬁeld on the sphere [19.8b] has
only one singular point, and its index is 2 (= χ), in accord with the Poincaré–Hopf Theo-
rem. On a torus (g = 1) we have seen we need not have any singular points in the ﬂow. But if
g ⩾2, there must be singular points, for the sum of their indices is χ ̸= 0. In this general case,
is it always possible to generalize the dipole ﬁeld on the sphere, to ﬁnd a ﬂow with only one
singular point of index χ? (Hint: A new ﬁeld can be created by coalescing two or more of its
singular points into one. For example, we can imagine creating the dipole ﬁeld in [19.8b] by
coalescing the two vortices in [19.8a].)
33. Vector Fields on Sg with −χ Saddle Points. Show (by drawing it!) that it is possible to con-
struct a vector ﬁeld on Sg (with g ⩾2) such that there are precisely (2g −2) = −χ singular
points, each with I = −1. (Hints: (A) First tackle g = 2; the generalization to higher genus turns
out to be obvious. (B) Picture S2 as two bagels still joined together. Next, imagine this surface
crushed almost ﬂat under a great weight, so that it resembles two joined annuluses. Finally,
conﬁrm (by drawing it!) that it is possible to place one saddle point on the “top” surface, and
one on the “bottom,” and to have the top and bottom ﬁelds agree where they meet, at the
edges.)


ACT IV
Parallel Transport


Chapter 21
An Historical Puzzle
Parallel transport1 is now understood to be one of the most fundamental and powerful concepts
of Differential Geometry, but it was remarkably late to the game.
By 1915 most of the fundamental concepts and computational tools of modern Differential
Geometry in n-dimensional space were already in place, and not a moment too soon.
Einstein had spent the previous decade struggling to reconcile his 1905 Special Theory of Rela-
tivity with gravity. He had known since 1905 that no physical effect could travel faster than light,
but Newton’s Inverse-Square Law—unquestioned since 1687—insisted that if a giant solar ﬂare
erupted from the surface of the Sun, its tiny gravitational tug on the Earth would be felt instantly,
despite the fact that the light from the ﬂare would take eight minutes to reach Earth—a naked
contradiction!
Only very gradually did Einstein’s physical intuition drive him towards Differential Geo-
metry, where he was miraculously blessed to ﬁnd that in 1901 Gregorio Ricci (1853–1925) and
Tullio Levi-Civita (1873–1941) had jointly published “the marvelously prepared and almost predestined
instrument for the exposition of his theory”2—that instrument was Tensor Calculus.3
On the 25th of November, 1915, Einstein ﬁnally ended his terrible, decade-long struggle, har-
nessing Tensor Calculus to write down his famous Field Equation that reconciled gravity with
Special Relativity; he christened this union the General Theory of Relativity. Einstein had suc-
ceeded in understanding the true nature of gravity: it is the Riemannian curvature4 impressed

gravitational ﬁeld by travelling through curved spacetime along geodesics.5
As of the time of this writing, in 2020, every single testable prediction of the theory has
been conﬁrmed, including the astonishing, Nobel Prize–winning6 conﬁrmation—on the 14th of
September, 2015—that gravitational waves exist, which Einstein had predicted almost exactly a
century earlier, in 1916!
Little appreciated is the fact that in several instances these experimental conﬁrmations have
attained a breathtaking degree of accuracy, rivalling or exceeding those of the former gold stan-
dard: Quantum Electrodynamics. Indeed, our daily use of Global Positioning System (GPS)
technology7 would simply be impossible without taking into account the precise time-warping
effect of gravity predicted by General Relativity! Einstein’s 1915 discovery therefore stands as

Chapter 21 An Historical Puzzle
[21.1] Tullio Levi-Civita (1873–1941)
not only a supremely beautiful scientiﬁc
triumph of the human intellect, but also
as one of the best-tested physical theories
we have.
But there is a serious puzzle8 here, one
that is not widely known or recognized.
Einstein’s success was all the more remark-
able, and remains all the more puzzling,
because he achieved it before Levi-Civita—
pictured in [21.1]—discovered9 the concept
of parallel transport, which did not occur
until 1917! Without this concept, I person-
ally do not know of any way to make com-
plete geometrical sense of Einstein’s 1915
discovery.
So what is parallel transport? Like the
concept of the geodesic, it is a queer amp-
hibian, equally at home in the world of
extrinsic geometry and in the world of
intrinsic geometry, and we shall now des-
cribe what it looks like in each of these
worlds, and attempt to understand how it
is able to straddle the two.
8For readers familiar with General Relativity, there is in fact a second, even more spectacular puzzle: in November 1915,
Einstein did not know the Differential Bianchi Identity—stated later as (29.17)—and therefore he did not realize that energy–
momentum conservation followed automatically from his law! See Pais (1982, p. 256).

Extrinsic Constructions
22.1
Project into the Surface as You Go!
Here is the heuristic idea of what Levi-Civita sought to achieve in his fundamental paper of 1917.
To parallel transport a tangent vector w to a surface S along a curve K connecting two points a to
b within S, we want to always keep w pointing in the same direction (and having the same length)
while remaining tangent to S as it moves along K, the direction of w at each moment always being
parallel to its direction a moment before.
a
b
K
~K
w
w
[22.1] In the Euclidean plane there is a global concept of paral-
lelism, manifested by the ﬂow with constant velocity vector w.
To parallel transport w along K, we need only restrict this vec-
tor ﬁeld to K. Thus we always obtain the same vector w at b,
whether we travel along K or eK. This path-independence holds
only in this case of vanishing curvature.
But this is seemingly impossible!
If we move even a small distance ϵ
from p to q along K, then the vec-
tor w in the tangent plane Tp, when
rigidly moved parallel to itself (in
R3) to q, will generally not lie in Tq,
but will instead stick out of S.
In the Euclidean plane no such
problem arises, and there is a sim-
ple global sense of parallelism, result-
ing from the fact that through any
point not lying on a line L (in the
direction w), there is a unique line
that is parallel to L, in the same
direction w. This global parallelism
can be pictured as a uniform ﬂow
across the plane, with velocity w; see
[22.1]. The parallel-transported vec-
tor along K is simply the restriction
to K of this constant velocity ﬁeld.
It is therefore trivially clear that we always obtain the same parallel-transported vector w at b,
regardless of whether we get there by travelling along K, or along some other route eK.
Levi-Civita’s key observation was that this path-independence of the parallel-transported
vector only occurs if the space is ﬂat; if the space is curved then parallel transport (as it will be
deﬁned momentarily) along two different paths will yield different ﬁnal vectors. This crucial phe-
nomenon is called holonomy, and is the subject of an upcoming chapter by that name. As we
shall see, this holonomy can be used to measure curvature, and not only the Gaussian curvature of
surfaces, but also the Riemannian curvature of higher-dimensional curved spaces, like Einstein’s
curved, 4-dimensional spacetime.
If we try to repeat the Euclidean construction in the hyperbolic plane, H2, then we immedi-
ately run into trouble, for if we are given a point and a line L though it, we know that there are
now inﬁnitely many “parallel” lines running through a neighbouring point; which one should we
choose?!
233

234
•
Chapter 22 Extrinsic Constructions
Later we shall return to this topic of how to carry out parallel transport in H2, or equivalently
on the pseudosphere, but let us now immediately jump in at the deep end and see how to do
parallel transport on a general curved surface.
Our ﬁrst extrinsic method of parallel transport is illustrated in [22.2], using the notation that
was introduced in the opening paragraph, above. If we move the tangent vector w at p parallel
to itself (as a vector in R3) a small (ultimately vanishing) distance ϵ along the curve K, then w is
no longer tangent to S at q: it sticks out of the tangent plane Tq, but only slightly, at angle Θ(ϵ).
The best approximation to w that is tangent to S at q is w||, obtained by projecting w orthogonally
down onto Tq. If P denotes this projection, and n(q) is the unit normal at q, then, as explained
by [22.2],
w|| = P[w] = w −(w·n)n.
(22.1)
To parallel transport w along K, we must imagine breaking K into an enormous number oftiny
steps of length ϵ, repeating this process of translating in R3 and projecting back into the surface,
over and over, one ϵ-step at a time, until we ﬁnally arrive at the end of K. Even then, this is merely
an approximation of parallel transport—perfect parallel transport is only achieved when we take
the limit that ϵ vanishes, in which case we continually project into the surface as we go.

[22.2] To parallel transport the tangent vector w
from p to the neighbouring point q a distance ϵ
away, we move it parallel to itself in R3, then either
(i) project it down onto Tq to get w|| or (ii) rotate
it down to get ew. The two constructions are equiv-
alent, because we ultimately take the limit that ϵ
vanishes.
Note that the projection w|| in [22.2] is
slightly shorter than the original vector w.
If we instead simply rotate w straight down
onto Tq then we obtain ew, pointing in the
same direction as w|| but with |ew| = |w|. (The
length |w| is irrelevant to the construction, but
here we have chosen it have the same unit
length as n, for ease of visualization.) But, since
limϵ→0 Θ(ϵ) = 0, we see that
w|| ≍ew.
Finally, because perfect parallel transport takes
this limit of vanishing ϵ, we deduce that paral-
lel transport preserves length.
We have thus arrived at two equivalent
extrinsic methods of parallel transport:
To parallel transport the tangent vector w to S along a curve K, move w parallel
to itself in R3 while continually either (i) projecting into S as you go or (ii)
rotating down to S as you go. The length of the vector remains constant as it is
parallel transported.
(22.2)
Method (ii) is much easier in practice, and we strongly encourage you to try it out yourself
on any curved object you have at hand—fruits and vegetables are convenient, and they have a
crucial advantage that will soon become apparent: they can be peeled!
Draw any curve K you please on your surface, connecting point a to point b, press one end of
a toothpick down against the surface at a, in any tangent direction you like. Now move it parallel
to itself (in space) a small distance along K, then press that same end straight down against the
surface (so that it becomes tangent again), . . . repeat, . . . repeat, . . . repeat, . . . until you arrive at b!
Figure [22.3] illustrates this on a pomelo. Although we may choose any direction at a that is
tangent to S, here we have chosen w to be the initial velocity along K, in order to make this point:

in general, w|| does not remain tangent to K, though it certainly does remain tangent to the surface,
by construction.
Here we have chosen the path K so as to be close to a vertical section of the surface of the
pomelo, and in the photograph on the right we have deliberately taken the picture from almost
directly overhead, so that it looks remarkably straight. It is therefore perhaps very surprising and
confusing how fast the toothpick rotates from initially being tangent to K, to being almost perpen-
dicular to K by the end. This because our photograph does not reveal just how curved K is respect
to the intrinsic geometry. The intrinsic, geodesic curvature of this particular path K will be revealed
in Section 22.3, where a different method of parallel transport will be revealed.

Under what circumstances would parallel trans-

this happens precisely when G is a geodesic!

look at the velocity at neighbouring points p

may construct the geodesic motion that ensues by performing parallel transport: carry v a short
distance ϵ within S along itself, then press it down onto the surface to obtain the new velocity
there . . . repeat!
Figure [22.5] illustrates this new method of constructing geodesics. In order to check the cor-
rectness of our ultimate solution, we ﬁrst construct a geodesic segment G on our surface (a squash)
using our original trick of stretching a string across it, here tied to two (normal) toothpicks at the
ends. If we remove the string, but leave behind an initial toothpick tangent to the start of the
string, we can then take this initial-velocity toothpick and parallel transport it along itself. As you
see, and as we urge you to try for yourself, this construction yields the same geodesic segment G
as the string did.
22.3
Potato-Peeler Transport
We will now describe a third extrinsic method of parallel transport that will quickly prove its
mettle,1 yielding important properties of parallel transport that are not immediately evident from
our ﬁrst two constructions seen in (22.2).
In [22.2] imagine that we use a potato peeler to peel off a narrow strip of S surround-
ing the movement ϵ along K. Now, instead of rotating v down to the surface, imagine that we
take this short strip of peel and bend it up, pressing it ﬂat onto Tp, bringing v|| to v, instead
of the other way around. If we keep peeling a narrow strip all along K, we arrive at our new
construction:
1This new construction is not readily found in modern textbooks, and I recall being elated when I ﬁrst hit upon it, more
than 30 years ago. Other authors likewise believed they had found something new: e.g., Koenderink (1990), Casey (1996),
and Henderson (1998). But when the time came to write this book, I turned to original sources, and there I found that what
we had rediscovered was ﬁrst discovered, more than a century ago, by Levi-Civita himself! To read Levi-Civita’s own account
of his idea, translated into English, see Levi-Civita (1926, p. 102). For more on the history of the discovery, see Goodstein (2018,
Ch. 12).

Potato-Peeler Parallel Transport. To parallel transport the tangent vector
v to S along a curve K, peel a narrow (ultimately vanishingly thin) strip of S
containing K as its centre line. Lay this strip ﬂat in the plane, then do ordinary
Euclidean parallel transport of v along the ﬂattened K. Finally, reattach K (and
the constructed vectors) to S in its original location.
(22.3)
Figure [22.6] reveals how we cheated and actually used this method (rather than those in (22.2)) to
carry out the parallel transport previously shown in [22.3].
While a potato peeler conjures up the right mental image, it is not in fact the best tool for the
job. To obtain a tidy, narrow strip, take a small sharp knife and make a very shallow incision along
a curve just to one side of K, cutting beneath K; now do the same from the other side, thereby
cutting out the desired narrow strip of peel, with a shallow V-shaped cross-section.

Chapter 22 Extrinsic Constructions
[22.7] [a] A geodesic segment G on a pumpkin is ﬁrst constructed by stretching a string across its surface. Mean-
while, on the tabletop, a toothpick pointing along a straight strip of tape is parallel transported along that strip,
automatically remaining tangent to the centre line. [b] The string is removed, and the tape (with attached tooth-
picks) is unrolled onto the surface, starting at the same point and heading off in the same direction. As predicted,
the tape automagically rolls down onto the surface along the same geodesic curve G, and the toothpicks are
parallel-transported along it.
Two important properties of parallel transport become immediately clear from the new
construction.
First, if two vectors are parallel transported along a curve in the Euclidean plane, then clearly
the angle between them remains constant. The new construction immediately implies that the
same must therefore be true on a curved surface:
If two vectors are parallel transported along a curve on a curved surface, then the
angle between them remains constant.
(22.4)
Conversely, if only one of the vectors is known to be parallel-transported, and the angle with the
second is kept ﬁxed, then that second vector is necessarily parallel-transported, also.
Second, recall from (1.6), page 13 and from (1.7), page 14, that if a geodesic is peeled from the
surface and laid ﬂat on the table, it becomes a straight line; conversely, if a straight and narrow
strip of sticky tape is gradually rolled onto the surface, it will automatically generate a geodesic.
In the Euclidean plane, the direction vector of a line continues to point along the line as it is
parallel-transported along the line. We thus have a much more intuitive, immediate, visual proof
the previously established fact that,
If G is a geodesic traced at unit speed, launched with initial velocity v, then the
velocity at any future time is obtained by parallel-transporting the initial velocity
along G. Conversely, given an arbitrary initial point, and an arbitrary initial
velocity v tangent to S, parallel-transport of v along v yields the unique geodesic
arising from these initial conditions.

22.3 Potato-Peeler Transport

239
[22.8] The same strip shown in [22.7] is here rolled
down onto the surface shown in [22.5]. Unlike the
manual construction in [22.5], here both the gen-
eration of the geodesic and the parallel transport
of its velocity vector along it are automatic.
This is illustrated in [22.7]. Again, we urge
you to try this for yourself.2
Figure [22.8] simply illustrates the same
idea again. The strip form [22.7] has been remo-
ved from the pumpkin and rolled down onto
the surface of the yellow squash shown in [22.5],
along the same geodesic as before. But whereas
in that ﬁgure we were forced to manually carry
out the parallel transport and associated gener-
ation of the illustrated geodesic, this time both
things happen automatically.
2We recommend using masking tape (aka painter’s tape) because it comes in bright colours, and once a strip has been created,
it can be detached and reattached repeatedly, with ease. A simple way to create narrow strips (from the usually wide roll of
tape) is to stick a length of tape down onto a kitchen cutting board, then use a sharp knife to cut down its length, creating
strips as narrow as you please. As for the toothpicks, we used a hot glue gun to attach them, but just at their bases, so that
they were free to become tangent to the surface once the strip was attached

Chapter 23
Intrinsic Constructions
23.1
Parallel Transport via Geodesics
In the Euclidean plane, here is an easy, obvious way to parallel-transport a vector w along a
straight line L (with direction v): keep the angle between w|| and v constant as it moves along L. See
[23.1a].
Well, on a curved surface the analogue of a line L is a geodesic G, so it is natural to guess that
the Euclidean construction generalizes as follows:
To parallel transport a tangent vector w to a surface S along a geodesic G with
velocity v, simply keep the angle between w|| and v constant as it moves along G.
(23.1)
This intrinsically deﬁned method does indeed produce the same parallel-transported vector
as the three extrinsic methods above, as follows immediately [exercise] by combining (22.4) and
(22.5). This is illustrated in [23.2].
Let us repeat our mantra: please try this construction for yourself! Here we have used a
stretched string to emphasize the intrinsic nature of this construction, but in practice it is often
easier to construct the geodesic with narrow-sticky-tape construction, for the tape will continue to
roll down as a geodesic even in parts of the surface that bend towards you, across which a string
cannot be stretched, at least not from the outside of the surface.
To (intrinsically) parallel transport w along an arbitrary curve K in the Euclidean plane, the
ﬁrst step is to approximate K by a sequence K⋆of short, straight line segments, {Li}, all of which
have length less than ϵ, say. See [23.1b]. Keeping the angle constant along each successive Li, we
have parallel transported w along K⋆. Finally, taking the limit that ϵ vanishes, K⋆becomes K, and
we have achieved intrinsic parallel transport along K.

23.2 The Intrinsic (aka, “Covariant”) Derivative
•
241
Of course this is all somewhat theatrical in the Euclidean plane, where we have a global
concept of parellelism, but the point is that it is now clear what we must do on a curved surface:
To parallel transport a tangent vector w to a surface S along a general curve
K, approximate K by a sequence K⋆of geodesic segments {Gi}, each of length
less than ϵ, then carry w along each Gi, maintaining a constant angle between
the direction of Gi and w||. Finally, take the limit that ϵ vanishes, so that K⋆
becomes K.
23.2
The Intrinsic (aka, “Covariant”) Derivative
When we parallel-transport a vector along a curve K in a surface S, it appears to be unchanging
to an inhabitant of S who walks along K watching it. This idea of constancy opens the door to an
intrinsic measure of how fast a vector changes as it moves along a curve.
Suppose a particle moves at unit speed along a curve K on a surface S, its position at time t
being p(t), and its unit velocity being v(t). Furthermore, suppose that emanating from p(t) we
[23.2] A geodesic segment G on a pumpkin is ﬁrst
constructed by stretching a string across its surface.
Any initial tangent vector to the surface can then be
parallel transported along G simply by keeping the
angle between it and G constant.
have a vector w(t) that is tangent to S, so
that w is deﬁned everywhere along K (though
not necessarily anywhere else). What is the
intrinsic rate of change of w(t)?
Well, if p moves for a short time ϵ to q =
p(t + ϵ), then the extrinsically deﬁned rate of
change ∇vw is given by
ϵ∇vw = ϵw′(t) ≍w(q) −w(p),
where the difference of the two vectors on the
right makes perfectly good sense in R3. But
w(q) lives in Tq, while w(p) lives in Tp, so this
difference lives in neither, and so is certainly
not intrinsic to S.
It is precisely the parallel-transport dep-
icted in [22.2] that allows us to bring w(p) to
q as w||(p ù q), keeping it “constant.” We
can now compare this old value w||(p ù q)
to the new value w(q), to see how much it has
changed. Let Dv denote this intrinsic rate of
change (operator) along K, which we shall call
the intrinsic derivative, then
ϵDvw ≍w(q) −w||(p ù q).
Since both these vectors lie in Tq, so does their difference. Since Dvw is tangent to S, it may be
viewed as intrinsic to S.
WARNING: The standard name for Dv is the covariant derivative. Historically, the word
“covariant” had to do with how the coordinate expression of Dv transforms under a change of
coordinates, but since “covariant” means little or nothing to the ears of modern students, we
would argue (by example!) that the time has come for a new, self-explanatory name. That said, we

[23.3] The Intrinsic (aka “Covariant”) Derivative, Dvw, which measures the intrinsic rate of change of w along
v, is especially easy to visualize if v is the velocity of a geodesic G, for then the strip of peel surrounding G
ﬂattens into a straight line, and parallel transport of w|| within the surface becomes ordinary Euclidean parallel
transport within the plane.
would be remiss if we did not warn the reader that (as of this writing in 2019) essentially every other
Differential Geometry (and physics) book instead refers to Dv as the covariant derivative. Finally, we
note that this is also called the Levi-Civita Connection.
In order to give a vivid picture of this intrinsic derivative, suppose for simplicity’s sake that
the curve is a geodesic, G. If we peel the strip surrounding G and press it onto the table, it becomes
the straight line illustrated in [23.3], and both the tangent vectors v(t) to G, and the tangent vector
ﬁeld w(t) to S (deﬁned along G) all get pressed down onto this table top, R2, just as in [22.6] and
[22.7]. Parallel transport of w along G (as in [23.2]) now amounts to ordinary Euclidean parallel
transport along this line in R2, keeping the angle between w|| and v constant, as in [23.1a].
As is evident in the ﬁgure, here w is growing in length and rotating counterclockwise as it
moves along G. The job of Dvw is to quantify the rate at which this is happening, i.e., the rate at
which w(t) departs from its initial value (as represented by w||) just as we begin to move away
from p along G.
Alternatively, and this is in fact the more standard deﬁnition, we may parallel transport w(q)
back to p to obtain w||(q ù p), and then compare it to the original vector w(p), as illustrated in
[23.3]. Thus the intrinsic derivative Dvw at p may be pictured as emanating from p, lying with
Tp, given by
Dvw ≍w||(q ù p) −w(p)
ϵ
.
(23.2)
Figure [23.3] illustrates this geometric construction with ϵ = 0.1: we draw the change in w resulting
from moving one tenth of v, then stretch this change vector by a factor of ten. Of course the exact
value of Dvw is obtained only when we take the limit of this ﬁgure as ϵ vanishes.

23.2 The Intrinsic (aka, “Covariant”) Derivative
•
243
In the general case, where K is not geodesic, everything we have just visualized remains the
same, provided that we only peel off the part of the surface surrounding the very short segment
of K connecting p and q.
Note that the intrinsic constancy of w|| along K can now be neatly expressed by saying that
its intrinsic derivative vanishes:
Dvw|| = 0
⇐⇒
w|| is parallel-transported along v.
Here is an extrinsic way of looking at the intrinsic derivative. Instead of thinking of Dv as
measuring the rate of change of the projection onto the tangent plane, we may instead take the
projection of the rate of change ∇v itself. Once again letting P denote orthogonal projection onto
the tangent plane, this generalization of (22.1) takes the form
Dvw = P [∇vw] = ∇vw −(n·∇vw) n.
(23.3)
Note that the extrinsic term may also be expressed in terms of the Shape Operator:
Dvw = ∇vw + [w·S(v)] n.
In other words, to obtain Dvw we take the full rate of change ∇vw in R3, then subtract out
the part that is not tangent to the surface, thereby leaving behind the part that is intrinsic to the
surface.
The formula (23.3) may be used to prove [exercise] that the intrinsic derivative Dv obeys all
the same linearity and Leibniz (product) rules as the full vector derivative ∇v, so that if a and b
are constants, and f and g are scalar functions deﬁned along K, and x, y, z are tangent to S along
K, then
Dv[ax + by]
=
aDvx + bDvy,
D[fx+gy] z
=
fDxz + gDyz,
Dv[fx]
=
f Dvx + [Dvf] x = f Dvx + f′x,
Dv[x·y]
=
[Dvx]·y + x· [Dvy] .
(Here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to either time or distance along K.) However,
instead of establishing these facts by calculation, it is much simpler to think of ﬂattening onto the
tabletop the strip surrounding K, together with the vector ﬁelds x, y, z, for then Dv simply is ∇v.
The intrinisic derivative sheds new light on our earlier discussion of geodesic curvature. Recall
from [11.2], page 116, that the full acceleration κ ≡∇vv of a particle travelling at unit speed over
the surface can be broken down into two components:
∇vv = κ = κg + κn.
The ﬁrst component κg is the geodesic curvature vector: it is the component of the acceleration
tangent to S. It is automatically perpendicular to the trajectory, and it points towards the centre
of curvature as perceived by inhabitants of S, the magnitude |κg| being the curvature of this cir-
cle; in other words, it measures the part of the curvature of the trajectory that is intrinsic to S.
In contrast to this, the normal curvature vector κn is directed along n and is invisible to these
inhabitants.

244
•
Chapter 23 Intrinsic Constructions
Intuitively, κg should be the intrinsic rate of rotation of v within the surface:
κg = Dvv.
That this is indeed true follows immediately from (23.3), since κn = (n·∇vv) n.
If θ|| denotes the angle between v and any vector w|| that it parallel transported along the
trajectory, then (see Ex. 4) the geodesic curvature is simply the rate of turning of the velocity vector
within S, relative to the “constant” vector w||:
|κg| = |Dvθ||| = |θ′
|||.
(23.4)
A geodesic is a curve that seems straight to the inhabitants of S: in other words, κg = 0. Thus
the geodesic equation takes the form,
κg = 0
⇐⇒
Dvv = 0,
(23.5)
which is simply another way of looking at the fact that v is parallel transported along itself, and
appears constant to the inhabitants of S.
On the other hand, if a curve within S is not geodesic, then (see Ex. 4) when a strip surrounding
it is peeled off and pressed ﬂat onto the plane, it will appear curved, and its curvature within the
plane is none other than κg!

Holonomy
24.1
Example: The Sphere
Consider [24.1], which depicts a geodesic triangle ∆on the sphere of radius R, the angle between
the meridians being Θ, and the third side being a segment of the equator.
q
r
p
A
C
B
R(∆) = Θ
[24.1] When A is parallel transported
round the geodesic triangle ∆, it returns to
p rotated by the holonomy of ∆, namely,
R(∆) = Θ.
Suppose we start with the south-pointing vector
B at q on the equator, and then use (23.1) to parallel
transport it to p, along two different geodesic routes. If
we carry it due north along the meridian geodesic qp,
we obtain A. But if we instead parallel transport it due
east along the geodesic equator segment qr (maintain-
ing the right angle with the geodesic), and then carry
it due north along the meridian geodesic rp, we obtain
the quite different vector C. This discrepancy between
the result of parallel transport along different routes
is the holonomy we alluded to earlier, which Levi-
Civita discovered in 1917.
It turns out to be fruitful to look at this holonomy
in a slightly different way. Instead of carrying B to p
along two different routes, suppose we start with A at p
and then parallel transport it counterclockwise around
the closed loop, p ù q ù r ù p. The ﬁgure shows
that it returns to p having undergone a counterclock-
wise rotation of R(∆) = Θ. This is the holonomy of ∆,
and we can now introduce the general deﬁnition:
The holonomy R(L) of a simple closed loop L on a surface S is the net rotation of
a tangent vector to S that is parallel transported around L.
(24.1)
Note that this deﬁnition does not specify which tangent vector is to be parallel-transported.
The reason is that (22.4) implies that all tangents vectors must rotate rigidly together, through the
same angle R(L). Thus,
We may think of the holonomy as the rotation of the entire tangent plane as it is
parallel transported around the loop.
The deﬁnition of holonomy also does not specify where on L we should begin. To see why this,
too, does not matter, suppose that instead of starting with A at p, we start with B at q, then parallel
transport it q ù r ù p ù q. Using (23.1), you may visually conﬁrm that upon return to q, the
vector has undergone the same rotation R(∆) = Θ as before. More generally [exercise], convince
245

Chapter 24 Holonomy
yourself that the holonomy is independent of the starting point of the loop (as well as the initial tangent
vector).
Next, note that in [24.1] the counterclockwise sense of the holonomy on the sphere matches the
sense in which we traverse ∆. This will turn out to be because the sphere has positive curvature.
If we had instead transported the vector on a surface of negative curvature, then the rota-
tion would have been opposite to the direction of transport. At this point we strongly encourage
you to verify this empirically, using the sticky-strip construction of geodesics to create a geodesic
triangle on a negatively curved patch of a suitable fruit or vegetable. You may then easily parallel-
transport a toothpick around the triangle by maintaining a constant angle with each successive
edge.
Not only is the sign of R(L) determined by the curvature within ∆, its magnitude is too! The
constant curvature of the sphere is K = (1/R2), so the total curvature residing within ∆is
K(∆) =

dA = 1
R2 [R2 Θ] = Θ,
and therefore, for L = ∆,
R(L) = K(L).
(24.2)
As we shall see, this is no accident—it is true for any simple loop L on any surface S! Estab-
lishing this result (in the next chapter) will furnish us with a seemingly universal key, capable
of unlocking some of the deepest mysteries we have encountered. It will unlock the Theorema
Egregium. It will unlock the intrinsic nature of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem. It will unlock
the metric curvature formula, (4.10), the “Star Trek phaser” delivered from our future. And its
generalization to higher dimensions will unlock the Riemannian curvature that lies at the heart of
Einstein’s curved-spacetime theory of gravity.
In fact the list goes on, extending far beyond the conﬁnes of this book. It includes Sir Michael
Berry’s remarkable 1983 discovery (see Shapere and Wilczek (1989) and Berry (1990)) of what is
now called the Berry phase in quantum mechanics, as well as other “geometric phases” in physics.
For a lovely selection of applications of holonomy to physics, see Berry (1991) (but be warned that
we call holonomy, physicists often call anholonomy).
24.2
Holonomy of a General Geodesic Triangle
Figure [24.2] depicts a general geodesic triangle ∆on a general surface, the interior angles being
θi and the exterior angles being φi, so
θi + φi = π.
(24.3)
We know that the holonomy R(∆) is independent of the vector that is parallel transported around
it, and we now use this freedom to make a choice that will make the answer vividly clear: we
choose the tangent vector v to the ﬁrst edge of ∆.
Parallel transport keeps v tangent to the ﬁrst edge, so when it reaches the end, it makes angle
φ2 with the second edge. Since this second edge is also geodesic, the angle φ2 is maintained as v
is parallel transported along it. Thus, when it arrives at the end of the second edge, it makes angle
(φ2 + φ3) with the third and ﬁnal edge, and this angle is maintained as it moves along that edge,

ﬁnally returning to its starting point as v||, making angle (φ1 + φ2 + φ3) with the initial edge. Thus
we can see that the holonomy is

[24.2] The tangent vector v to the ﬁrst edge of a
general geodesic triangle ∆on a general surface is
parallel transported around ∆, returning to its starting
point as v||, rotated by the holonomy R(∆).
In our discussion of Hopf’s Umlaufstatz,
we began by noting (see [17.1], p. 176) that if
a particle travels round a Euclidean triangle
∆then the rotation of the velocity vector is
(φ1 + φ2 + φ3) = 2π. Thus the holonomy for-
mula (24.4) measures how much this total
rotation (φ1 + φ2 + φ3) of the velocity differs
from the Euclidean prediction of 2π.
Throughout this book we have used a
different way of measuring the degree to
which a geodesic triangle on a curved sur-
face departs from a Euclidean one, namely,
its angular excess, E(∆). But in fact these two
conceptually different measures of the cur-
vature within ∆are equal! To see this, we
combine (24.3) with (24.4):
R(∆) = 2π −[(π −θ1) + (π −θ2) + (π −θ3)] = θ1 + θ2 + θ3 −π,
so,
R(∆) = E(∆).
(24.5)
All of the above generalizes easily from a geodesic 3-gon to a geodesic m-gon, Pm. First, [24.2]
clearly generalizes to yield
R(Pm) = 2π −

On the other hand, the angular excess of Pm is given by (18.4), page 189:

Once again using (24.3), we ﬁnd that the two seemingly different measures of the curvature within
Pm are actually equal:
R(Pm) = E(Pm).

Holonomy Is Additive
Recall from [2.8], page 23, that if we split ∆into two geodesic triangles ∆1 and ∆2, then the angular
excess E is additive:
E(∆) = E(∆1) + E(∆2).
It follows from (24.5) that the holonomy R is additive, too. However, we consider R to be the more
fundamental of the two concepts, so rather than view its additivity as being inherited from E, we
should try to understand this directly.
Figure [24.3] is such a direct, geometric proof that R is additive:
R(∆) = R(∆1) + R(∆2).

[24.3] Holonomy Is Additive. The geodesic triangle
∆is split into ∆1 and ∆2 by the insertion of the
dashed geodesic. The tangent vector v to the ﬁrst
edge of ∆1 is parallel transported around ∆1 and then
around ∆2. We see that the parallel transport back
and forth along the dashed geodesic “cancels,” and
therefore R(∆) = R(∆1) + R(∆2).
Here we have inserted the dashed geodesic
into our original geodesic triangle ∆, thereby
splitting it into the two geodesic triangles
∆1 and ∆2. The tangent vector v to the ﬁrst
edge of ∆1 is parallel-transported around
∆1, returning home rotated by R(∆1). It is
then parallel-transported around ∆2, return-
ing home rotated by R(∆2). So the total rota-
tion after parallel translation around both is
[R(∆1) + R(∆2)], as illustrated.
But because the ﬁnal edge of ∆1 (start-
ing at q) is also the ﬁrst edge of ∆2 (ending
at q), we parallel-trans-port the vector along
the dashed geodesic twice, in succession, in
opposite directions, so the vector returns to q
unchanged. Successively parallel-transporting
a vector around ∆1 and then ∆2 is therefore
equivalent to parallel-transporting it around
∆, as was to be shown.
In this sense, parallel-transportation back and forth along the same curve “cancels,” even if
that curve is not a geodesic.
24.4
Example: The Hyperbolic Plane
We end this chapter by applying the concept of parallel transport to the pseudosphere (via the
Beltrami–Poincaré half-plane model), to obtain a new, simple intrinsic geometric demonstration1
of the constant negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane. In order to do this we shall assume, for
now, the fundamental fact (24.2)—which will be proved in the next chapter—that the holonomy
of a loop measures the total curvature within it.
Before we begin the demonstration, we make the important observation: just as we originally
used the angular excess to give an intrinsic deﬁnition of the curvature K(p) at a point [see (2.1),
p. 18], so (24.2) can now be used in the same way to ﬁnd the curvature at a point p.
1The following argument previously appeared in Needham (2014).

[24.4] The “rectangle” abcd (with area A) on the pseudosphere (left) is conformally mapped to ABCD in
the Beltrami–Poincaré upper-half-plane (right). When the illustrated vector at a is parallel-transported coun-
terclockwise around abcd, it returns rotated clockwise by R. The conformality of the map ensures that the
parallel-transported vector in the map undergoes the same rotation R.
If Lp is a small loop around p, then we can apply (24.2) to Lp as it shrinks down to p to ﬁnd
the curvature at p:
K(p) = lim
Lp→p
R(Lp)
A(Lp) = holonomy per unit area at p.
(24.9)
We can now return to the problem at hand. On the pseudosphere of radius R, consider
the “rectangle” abcd (traced counterclockwise) bounded by the vertical segments ad and bc
of geodesic tractrix generators (Θ being the angle from the ﬁrst to the second) together with
the nongeodesic horizontal circular arcs ab, cd. See the left side of [24.4]. As illustrated, let us
parallel-transport a vector round abcd to discover the total curvature within it.
The right side of [24.4] depicts the conformal image in the Beltrami–Poincaré model: abcd is
mapped to the rectangle with vertices A = (x, Y1), B = (x + Θ, Y1), C = (x + Θ, Y2), D = (x, Y2). Thus,
using (5.6), page 55, the area A of the rectangle abcd on the pseudosphere is

At a we have chosen an initial vector pointing up the pseudosphere, along ad. As we parallel-
transport it along ab, it rotates clockwise relative to the direction of motion; along bc it maintains
the constant illustrated angle • with the direction of motion (because it is a geodesic); along cd it
rotates counterclockwise relative to the direction of motion, but not as much as it did on ab; ﬁnally,

[24.5] The initially vertical vector at A is parallel transported along the horizontal Euclidean line segment AB

centred on the horizon, y = 0), then maintain constant angle with each geodesic segment, in succession. Finally,
we let n go to inﬁnity.
it maintains constant angle with the geodesic da, returning to a having undergone a negative net
rotation of R.
Because the Beltrami–Poincaré map is conformal, when the vector is transported around
ABCD it undergoes the same net rotation R. But, as we now explain, the crucial advantage of
the map is that it enables us to see2 what this rotation actually is.
Divide the nongeodesic horizontal segment AB of Euclidean length Θ into n small segments
of length (Θ/n). Next, as illustrated in [24.5], approximate these segments with geodesic segments:
recall that these are arcs of circles centred on the horizon. Let ϵ be the angle that each such arc
subtends on the horizon, as illustrated.
As the initially-vertical Start vector is parallel-transported along the ﬁrst geodesic segment,
its angle with that segment remains constant, and it therefore rotates through angle −ϵ. Likewise
for each successive segment, so that after all n segments have been traversed the total rotation
from Start to Finish is −nϵ. But since
rϵ ≍Θ
n
and
r ≍Y1,
we deduce that the total angle through which the vector is rotated in the map is
RAB ≍−nϵ ≍−Θ

The same reasoning yields RCD = (Θ/Y2). And since the vector does not rotate along either

Thus,

The fact that this answer is independent of the size, shape, and location of the rectangle proves,
via (24.9), that the hyperbolic plane does indeed have constant negative intrinsic curvature −1/R2,
as was to be shown.

An Intuitive Geometric Proof of the Theorema Egregium
25.1
Introduction
Several proofs of the Theorema Egregium have been found since Gauss ﬁrst shocked the world with
it in 1827. By far the most common proof, to be found in essentially all textbooks, is a variant of
Gauss’s original proof: perform a lengthy computation, sleep through the journey, then awake to
ﬁnd yourself staring at a formula for the extrinsic curvature Kext that simply turns out to depend
only on the metric, thereby establishing that Kext = κ1κ2 is in fact intrinsic to the surface.
There is no question that this is a watertight proof, just as it was when Gauss ﬁrst wrote it
down in 1827, but we are left clueless as to why the result is true!
In his authoritative (and excellent) book, A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry (Berger
2003, p. 106), Professor Marcel Berger (1927–2016)—one of the foremost geometric authorities of
the late twentieth century—provides summaries of the various known proofs, and concludes, “To
our knowledge there is no simple geometric proof of the Theorema Egregium today.”1 The purpose of this
chapter is to rectify this situation by providing such a simple geometric proof.2
Rather than trying to understand the Theorema Egregium directly, we shall instead seek to
understand Gauss’s initial discovery, his so-called “Beautiful Theorem,” (13.1). For convenience’s
sake, we restate the result here, again quoting Gauss’s own words, exactly as he recorded the
discovery in his private notebook of 1816:
“Beautiful Theorem. If a curved surface on which a ﬁgure is ﬁxed takes different
shapes in space, then the surface area of the spherical image of the ﬁgure is always
the same.”
In Section 13.3 we explained that the local Theorema Egregium follows easily and intuitively
from the Beautiful Theorem, simply by letting the ﬁgure shrink down towards a point. So, to
understand the Beautiful Theorem is to understand the Theorema Egregium.
But, as we noted in that same section, Dombrowski (1979) found that even in his private
notebooks Gauss did not leave any trace of how he discovered the result, nor did he give any
indication of a proof (assuming that he had one).
As should be clear from the present context, we shall prove the Beautiful Theorem using par-
allel transport, a concept whose discovery by Levi-Civita lay more than a century in the future in
1As soon as I discovered the simple geometric proof that I am about to present, I sent it to Banchoff, Berger, and Penrose, none
of whom had ever seen it before. In particular, Berger, whose ﬁrst language was French, emailed back, “I am glad to be able to
congratulate you for this amazing proof, bypassed for above more than a century, for not only [is it] one of the most beautiful
result[s] in geometry, but also this result started the whole Chern, etc. business.”
2As this book neared completion, I learned that the same insight was previously published by Professor David W. Henderson
(1998, Problem 6.3), of Cornell University. I was about to write to him when I learned that he had been struck by a car and
killed, just days earlier, on December 20th, 2018. So, in the interest of keeping the record straight, the credit for this discovery
should go to the late Professor Henderson (unless there is a precursor that I am not aware of). Regardless of its provenance,
I hope that my visualization here (which Henderson does not provide) will help to make this simple and intuitive proof
much more widely known. (And, on an extremely personal note, priority isn’t everything: the startling, unanticipated ﬂash of
clarity—in the Sierra mountains, surrounded by pristine snow—was one of the happiest moments of my life.)

1816. Thus, as intuitive and simple as we hope you will ﬁnd our parallel-transport proof, it could
not have been Gauss’s original approach.
We stress that Gauss discovered the Beautiful Theorem fully 11 years prior to developing his
1827 calculational apparatus for analyzing general surfaces. Thus the enigma remains, and, with
it, the tantalizing possibility that a quite different, even simpler approach may exist—but this may
have to await the second coming of Gauss.
25.2
Some Notation and Reminders of Deﬁnitions
Let S be the surface with unit normal vector ﬁeld n, S2 be the unit sphere, and n : S 7→S2 be the
spherical map.
Let Kext be the extrinsic curvature, deﬁned as the local (signed) area expansion factor of the
spherical map, as introduced in (12.3), p. 132.
Let a tilde (e) denote a quantity deﬁned on S2. So, for example, A denotes area on S, while e
A
denotes area on S2.
Let E(∆) be the angular excess of a geodesic triangle ∆on S, or more generally let E(Pm)
denote the angular excess of a geodesic m-gon, Pm, given by (18.4), p. 189.
Let L be a simple loop bounding a region Ωof S, and let R(L) denote the net rotation (holon-
omy angle) of a tangent vector w to S that is parallel transported counterclockwise round L, the
sense of rotation being determined by having n pointing at our eye. For ease of visualization, let
us assume that Kext has a single sign (either always positive, or else always negative) throughout
Ω, so that n(Ω) does not contain any folds; see the discussion in Section 17.5.
Likewise, let eR(eL) denote the holonomy of a tangent vector to S2 that is parallel transported
around the image eL ≡n(L) on S2 of L.
Finally, let Kext(Ω) denote the total amount of extrinsic curvature within Ω,
Kext(Ω) =
∫∫
Ω
Kext dA,
and let K(Ω) denote the total amount of intrinsic curvature within Ω,
K(Ω) =
∫∫
Ω
K dA = R(L).
25.3
The Story So Far
Let us brieﬂy recap what we actually know so far. This is important, because throughout this book
we have felt at liberty to quote (and use) future results long before we were in a position to prove
or explain them. That said, we have at all times scrupulously avoided so much as a whiff of circular
reasoning.
Nevertheless, it is quite possible that in the course of our time-travelling exposition the line
between what is already established and what has yet to be proved may have become blurred.
Here, then, are the few facts that we shall need in the following explanation of the Beautiful
Theorem, all of which have been properly established:
•
Since Kext is deﬁned to be the local (signed) area expansion factor of the spherical map, the
total amount of extrinsic curvature within Ωon S is the area of its image eΩon S2:
Kext(Ω) =
∫∫

Kext dA =

Ω

A = e
A( eΩ).

254
•
Chapter 25 An Intuitive Geometric Proof of the Theorema Egregium
•
As we proved in (12.8), page 134, the extrinsic curvature can be expressed as the product of
the principal curvatures:
Kext = κ1κ2.
Recall that we initially proved this by examining the effect of n on a small rectangle aligned
with the principal directions. However, later ((15.8), p. 153) we established that all shrinking
shapes ultimately undergo the same expansion, κ1κ2.
Thus the area on S2 of the image eΩ= n(Ω) can also be expressed as,
e
A( eΩ) = Kext(Ω) =
∫∫
Ω
κ1κ2 dA.
•
Harriot’s 1603 result ((1.3), p. 8) on a sphere of radius R implies (with R = 1) that on S2 we
have eE(e∆) = e
A(e∆), and this easily generalizes to a geodesic m-gon, ePm:
eE(ePm) = e
A(interior of ePm).
•
But on S2 we also have proved in (24.5) that eR(e∆) = eE(e∆), and in (24.7) we generalized this to
geodesic m-gons. Thus if ePm is a geodesic m-gon on S2 then the net rotation [holonomy] of a
vector that is parallel-transported around ePm is the same as the area it encloses:
eR(ePm) = e
A(interior of ePm).
•
If eL is the (generally nongeodesic) image on S2 of the simple loop L on S, we may approximate
eL with a geodesic m-gon and then let m →∞. Thus, combining the above results, we may
summarize the relevant known facts as follows:
The Story So Far. If the simple loop L on S (enclosing the region Ωof single-
signed extrinsic curvature) is mapped by n to eL, then the total amount of extrinsic
curvature within Ωon S is the (signed) area of eΩon S2, bounded by eL, and this
is in turn is equal to the holonomy of a tangent vector to S2 that it parallel-
transported around eL:
∫∫
Ω
κ1κ2 dA = Kext(Ω) = e
A( eΩ) = eR(eL).
(25.1)
25.4
The Spherical Map Preserves Parallel Transport
Consider (25.1), which shows the simple loop L on S (a yellow squash, on the left) and its image
on S2 (a pomelo, on the right) under the spherical map, eL = n(L). The tangent planes at p and n(p)
are parallel, so any tangent vector ﬁeld w deﬁned along L on S is—after being transplanted from
p to n(p)—automatically also a tangent vector ﬁeld to S2 along eL.
While the shape of L is immaterial to the following argument, here we have chosen to con-
struct an intrinsic circle, using a stretched piece of string (not shown) to trace the locus of points at
constant distance from a ﬁxed point. To help visualize the effect of the spherical map on L, we have
erected normals at four equally spaced points along L; their image points on S2 can be identiﬁed

Ωon S2 (right). Furthermore, e
A(f

map preserves parallel transport, so eR (eL) = R(L). Thus the total extrinsic curvature Kext(Ω) is equal to the
intrinsically deﬁned holonomy R(L) on S.
by the fact that they have the same normals, as shown. Due to the disparity in the principal curva-
tures, note that the spherical image eL of this circle is stretched out rather dramatically into an oval
on S2.
Now suppose that w is not an arbitrary tangent ﬁeld to S along L, but, as illustrated, is instead
obtained by parallel-transporting an initial tangent vector w0 along L to generate w||. The choice of
w0 is immaterial to the argument, but in [25.1] we have chosen it to be tangent to L.
We now come to the surprisingly simple and elegant crux of the matter. By the deﬁnition of
parallel transport, the rate of change of w|| is always perpendicular to S as we travel along L, i.e.,
the rate of change is along n. But this means that the rate of change of w|| is also perpendicular
to S2 at n(p), for the normal n to S at p is the same as the normal to S2 at n(p). In other words,
the same vector w||—transplanted from p to n(p)—is automatically parallel-transported along eL
on the sphere!
Let us make the same point differently, in the hope that (one way or the other) this critically
important result will become crystal clear in the process. Our recipe [22.2] for parallel transport
calls for us to move w|| along L parallel to itself in R3, while continually projecting back into the
surface (or, technically, into the tangent plane Tp) as we go, thereby obtaining w||. Now transplant
(by simple translation in R3) both w|| and Tp from p on S to n(p) on S2. The transplanted tangent
plane simply is the tangent plane to S2 at n(p), so projecting into it yields parallel transport on
S2, too.
In summary, and as illustrated,
The Spherical Map Preserves Parallel Transport. As w|| at p is parallel-
transported with respect to the surface S along L, the exact same vector w|| at
n(p) is automatically also parallel-transported with respect to S2 along eL = n(L).

The Beautiful Theorem and Theorema Egregium Explained
Upon executing a full circuit of L, we can now literally see that the net rotation (holonomy) on the surface
is equal to the net rotation on the sphere:
R(L) = eR (eL).
But, according to “The Story So Far,” (25.1), the net rotation on the sphere is simply the area
enclosed on the sphere, which in turn is the total amount of extrinsic curvature enclosed by L back
on the surface S:
R(L) = R(eL) = e
A( eΩ) = Kext(Ω) =
∫∫
Ω
κ1κ2 dA.
Since R(L) is deﬁned intrinsically on S, it is invariant under isometries of S, and we have therefore
proved Gauss’s original Beautiful Theorem of 1816.
If we take Lp to be a small loop on S surrounding p, and let Ωp be the region it encloses, and
then shrink Lp down to p, we recover a more standard local statement of the Theorema Egregium:
κ1κ2 = lim
Lp→p
R(Lp)
A(Ωp).
Alternatively, suppose we take Lp to be a small geodesic triangle ∆p containing p, and let
A(∆p) denote the area of the interior of ∆p. Then, by virtue of (24.5), we have also recovered our
original form of the Theorema Egregium, in terms of our original intrinsic deﬁnition ((2.1), p. 18) of
curvature:
κ1κ2 = lim
∆p→p
E(∆p)
A(∆p) = K(p).
Since the quantity on the right of either of the previous two equations is intrinsic to S,
it follows that the extrinsically deﬁned curvature κ1κ2 on the left must also be—with thrilling
unexpectedness!—invariant under isometries.
Thus we have arrived (at last!) at a satisfying geometric explanation of the empirical phenom-
ena that we ﬁrst observed in [13.1], page 139, and in [13.2], page 140.

Chapter 26
Fourth (Holonomy) Proof of the
Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
26.1
Introduction
Recall that as the curtain fell on Act III, no fewer than three distinct explanations of GGB had
played out, but all of them had been forced to rely on extrinsic geometry.
Only now, armed with parallel transport, are we ﬁnally in a position to fulﬁll the promise
of an intrinsic proof of GGB. The elegant argument that follows is entirely due to Hopf (1956,
pp. 112–113), but we shall explain some important details that Hopf’s original presentation took
for granted, and, more signiﬁcantly, we shall explicitly visualize the proof in a way that Hopf’s
exposition did not.
A signiﬁcant bonus of Hopf’s intrinsic proof of GGB is that it will simultaneously provide us
with a brand new proof of the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem, (19.6), page 206.
26.2
Holonomy Along an Open Curve?
Holonomy, as we have deﬁned it in (24.1), is a concept that only makes sense for a closed loop, L.
We parallel transport an initial vector w0 around L, generating w|| along the way, and when w||
returns to its starting point, we can compare it to the initial vector w0 to see the angle R(L) through
which it has been rotated.
The ﬁrst step in Hopf’s argument is to generalize the holonomy concept to an open curve K.
Clearly we should deﬁne this to be the rotation within the surface of w|| as it is parallel-transported
along K. But rotation relative to what?
Recall that we previously faced a similar problem in trying to deﬁne the index IF(s) of a
singular point s of a vector ﬁeld F on a surface S. As we illustrated in [19.7], page 205, our answer
was to introduce a ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U, the only requirement being that U not have any singular
points on or inside the loop L surrounding s. This allowed us to deﬁne the index as the number of
revolutions of F relative to U as we travel round s along the loop L, namely, (19.5), page 205:
2π IF(s) = δL (∠UF).
As we proved, this deﬁnition of the index is indeed well-deﬁned, which is to say that the choice of
the vector ﬁeld U does not matter, despite the fact that the precise variation in the angle ∠UF along L
certainly does depend on the speciﬁc choice of the U ﬁeld.
Let us now apply this same idea to the concept of holonomy. Reconsider [24.2], but now
thinking of the geodesic triangle ∆as made up of its successively traversed (geodesic) edges, Kj:
∆= K1 + K2 + K3,
as illustrated in [26.1]. (NOTE: We are reusing this example because having geodesic edges makes
parallel transport easy to visualize, but the following reasoning applies equally well to any
(nongeodesic) curve.)

Chapter 26 Fourth (Holonomy) Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
Figure [26.1] reproduces [24.2], but it introduces a ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U, enabling us to gen-
eralize the concept of holonomy. We deﬁne R(K) for the open curve K to be the net change in the
angle ∠Uw||—from U to the parallel-transported vector w||—as we travel along K:
RU(K) ≡δK (∠Uw||).
(26.1)
NOTES: The subscript U is essential here, for RU(K) does indeed depend on our arbitrary choice of U;
thus RU(K) has no true mathematical meaning; it is merely a stepping stone in the argument that
is to follow. That said, if two different vectors are parallel transported along K, the angle between
them remains ﬁxed (by virtue of (22.4)) and therefore they both rotate the same amount relative to
U. Thus, as the notation indicates, RU(K) is independent of the choice of w||.

[26.1] The holonomy R(∆) can be found by cover-
ing ∆with a nonsingular ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U, and
then summing over the edges Kj the change RU(Kj)
in the illustrated angle ∠Uw||.
The holonomy R(∆) of the closed trian-
gular loop ∆can then be expressed as the sum
of the “holonomies” of its edges:
R(∆) = RU(K1) + RU(K2) + RU(K3).
While each of the three individual terms on
the right does depend on the arbitrary choice
of U, their sum R(∆) = K(∆) is independent
of U.
We note that this approach provides a
better deﬁnition of holonomy than we had
before, solving a potential problem that we
glossed over in our initial discussion: what if
R(∆) > 2π? Then if we naively compare w|| to
w0 we will only (and incorrectly) perceive the
rotation R(∆) as being the excess over 2π. But
the use of a ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U allows us to keep continuous track of the rotation of w||, and
the above formula will yield the true value of R(∆).
26.3
Hopf’s Intrinsic Proof of the Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem

a ﬁnite number of singular points, si. Our ultimate aim will be to prove that

But, before we do so, let us explain how the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem and GGB both follow
immediately from this.
First, since the left-hand side of (26.2) is independent of F, it follows that the sum of the
indices on the right-hand side must have the same value for all vector ﬁelds. But, by examining
any of our previous examples of vector ﬁelds on Sg, such as the honey-ﬂow shown in [19.11],

page 209, this universal index sum
must equal χ(Sg) = 2 −2g, thereby pro-
ving the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem. Thus,
if we can prove (26.2), we will also have
our proof of GGB:
K(Sg) = 2π χ(Sg).
To begin to understand (26.2), con-
sider [26.2] which shows the same
geodesic triangle ∆as before, and the
same vector w|| parallel-transported
around its boundary. But now the
ﬁgure also imagines a vector ﬁeld F
on the surface, with a singular point
s within ∆. (Here we have speciﬁcally
pictured a source, but the argument
applies to any singular point.)
From this ﬁgure we deduce that,
K(∆) −2π IF(s)

R(∆) −δ∆(∠UF)

[
δKj(∠Uw||) −δKj (∠UF)

=
∑

δKj(∠Fw||).
The ﬁnal expression measures the rotation of w|| relative to F; it is manifestly independent of the
arbitrary ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U.
To simplify matters, let us adopt Hopf’s notation, and deﬁne Φ(Kj) to be the net rotation along
Kj of w|| relative to F, i.e., the net change in the angle between the vector ﬁeld F and the parallel-transported
vector w|| as we traverse Kj:
Φ(Kj) ≡δKj(∠Fw||).
NOTE: Φ(Kj) is independent of the choice of w||, for the same reason that RU(Kj) was.
Then the previous result may be written
K(∆) −2π IF(s) = ∑
j Φ(Kj).
(26.3)
Clearly, this result holds equally well if ∆is replaced with a polygon, and we also remind the
reader that this conclusion does not require that the edges be geodesics.
As usual, let (−Kj) denote Kj traversed in the opposite direction. Since parallel transport does
not depend on the direction in which a curve is traversed, we deduce that

change Φ(Kj) in the illustrated angle ∠Fw||. But each
edge of Kj abuts an oppositely directed edge of a neigh-
bouring polygon, so the sum of these rotations over all
polygons vanishes. Therefore, K(Sg) = 2π ∑

Pl with edges Kj (which, again, need not

Geometric Proof of the Metric Curvature Formula
27.1
Introduction
The sole purpose of this chapter is to use parallel transport to provide (at long last!) a geometric
proof of the “Star Trek phaser” formula, (4.10), page 38, for the curvature in terms of the metric,
which we repeat here:

(27.1)
We are now living more than 20 chapters in the future of the point at which this formula was ﬁrst
announced, so we begin by reminding the reader of the meaning of the (u, v) coordinates, and of
the metric components A and B.
The construction of a general coordinate system (as illustrated in [4.3], page 35) can always be
specialized to an orthogonal coordinate system (u, v) on a surface S, as illustrated in [27.1]. We ﬁrst
draw a family of nonintersecting curves covering the patch of surface we are analyzing, so that one
(and only one) curve from our family passes though each point bp on the patch. We now number
these curves arbitrarily (but differentiably) to create the u-coordinate, and call these curves, with
their assigned u-values, the u-curves.
To complete the orthogonal coordinate system, we now draw the orthogonal trajectories of
the u-curves, and label them differentiably with the v-coordinate, and call these v-curves.
Thus, as illustrated, the point bp on S can be labelled by the unique u-curve (say u = U) and v-
curve (say v = V) that intersect there. So, in the map, bp can now be represented as p = (U, V). Thus,
as illustrated, u-curves are represented in the map by vertical lines, while v-curves are represented
by horizontal lines.
NOTE: Here we are reverting to our earlier notation, distinguishing objects in the map from
corresponding objects in the surface by attaching a “hat” (b) to the latter. So, for example, an
element of area in the map will be denoted δA, while the corresponding area on the surface will
be denoted δ b
A.
Let X measure distance along v-curves on S, which correspond to horizontal lines in the map.
Likewise, let Y measure distance along u-curves, which correspond to vertical lines in the map.
We can now use X and Y to explain the meanings of A and B. If we move a small (ultimately
vanishing) distance δu along a horizontal line in the map, then the corresponding point on the
surface moves an ultimately proportional distance δX along the corresponding v-curve:
δX ≍A δu
⇐⇒
A is the local horizontal expansion factor.
Likewise, if we move a distance δv along a vertical line in the map, then the corresponding point
on the surface moves a distance δY along the corresponding u-curve, and

[27.1] The Metric in Orthogonal Coordinates. Having drawn a family of (nonintersecting) “u-curves”
(u = const.), we construct the v-curves as their orthogonal trajectories. If bp is the intersection of the curves
u = U and v = V, then it represented by the point p = (U, V) in the map. A small horizontal movement δu
in the map produces an ultimately proportional movement δX ≍A δu on the surface (along a v-curve), and a
vertical movement δv in the map produces an ultimately proportional orthogonal movement δY ≍B δv on the
surface (along a u-curve).
δY ≍B δv
⇐⇒
B is the local vertical expansion factor.
The metric then tell us the true distance dbs within the surface in terms of apparent distances
within the map, and Pythagoras’s Theorem implies that in our orthogonal (u, v)-coordinate system
it takes the form (4.9):
dbs2 = A2 du2 + B2 dv2.
27.2
The Circulation of a Vector Field Around a Loop
To avoid disrupting the ﬂow of the proof to follow, we ﬁrst address a lemma, namely, how to
calculate the circulation of a vector ﬁeld V around a small (ultimately vanishing) loop.
The required concept—called the curl of V—will be familiar to those who have studied under-
graduate Vector Calculus, but a reminder can do no harm; furthermore, our exposition will be
more geometrical than is customary.
Let V =

(27.2)
where VL is the (signed) projection of V onto the direction dr of L, and where ds = |dr|. For the
illustrated vortex, it is clear that VL is always positive on L, so the circulation CL(V) is positive.1
Now consider [27.2b], which illustrates a small (ultimately vanishing) coordinate rectangle R
centred at p, with sides δu and δv, and hence with area δA = δu δv. To calculate CR(V), we perform
a Riemann sum, and, as illustrated, we choose to use the midpoints of the sides. Of course in the
limit that R vanishes, this speciﬁc choice does not matter, but we note that this choice of midpoints
makes the approximation much more accurate than a random choice, the error for each side dying
away as the cube2 of the side.
The choice of midpoints also makes it especially easy to visualize and calculate the circulation.
The contribution to the circulation from the upward vertical edge through c is ultimately equal to
Q(c) δv. And the contribution from the downward edge through a is likewise [−Q(a)] δv. Thus
the net contribution from the two vertical edges is governed by the illustrated difference in the
vertical components of V, namely, {Q(c) −Q(a)} δv. But, as illustrated, this change in Q is in turn
governed by its partial derivative, which we may take to be evaluated at the centre p of R, as R
shrinks down towards it. Thus the net contribution of the two vertical edges to the circulation is
ultimately equal to (BuQ δu) δv.
Exactly the same reasoning applies to the two horizontal edges, and therefore the total
circulation around R is given by
CR(V)

1In many important physical circumstances, the value of CL(V) is independent of the precise shape of L; if [27.2a] were such
an example, CL(V) it would simply measure the total strength of the vortex. See VCA, Chapter 11.

Dry Run: Holonomy in the Flat Plane
In order to get our feet wet, let us see how to determine the holonomy per unit area ( ≍K) for a
small loop in the ﬂat plane. Of course the answer had better turn out to be K = 0!
In the previous chapter we generalized holonomy to an open curve bK, deﬁning it in (26.1) to be
the rotation of any parallel-transported vector w|| along bK, relative to an arbitrary (but singularity-
free) ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U:
RU(bK) ≡δbK (∠Uw||).
Recall that while this is independent of w||, it does not directly tell us anything about the geometry
of the surface—it merely measures the rotation of w|| relative to the arbitrarily chosen U ﬁeld.
However, if bK becomes a closed loop bL, then RU(bL) = R(bL) becomes independent of U, and it equals
the total amount of curvature within bL.
Let us take our surface S to be the ﬂat plane, and let us apply the idea above, using ordinary
polar coordinates: u = r, v = θ, A = 1, and B = r:
dbs2 = A2 du2 + B2 dv2 = dr2 + r2 dθ2.
On the left of [27.3] we see a small (ultimately vanishing) rectangular loop L = efghe in the
polar-coordinate map plane, with sides δr and δθ. On the right is its image bL = bebfbgbhbe on the (ﬂat!)
surface S. Let us choose the ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U to be radial, pointing outward along the rays
θ = const., and let us ﬁnd the holonomy along each of the four legs of the closed loop bL. Starting at
be, let us choose our initial vector w to be U at be, and now let us parallel transport it as w|| around
the loop.
On the ﬁrst leg of our journey, w|| does not rotate relative to U, so δRU(bebf) = 0. On the second
leg, as we see clearly in [27.3], the rotation of w|| is δRU(bfbg) = −δθ. On the third, radial leg bgbh there
is no rotation. Finally, as we return home along bhbe, the rotation of w|| relative to U is δθ.
Thus, the rotations of w|| relative to U cancel, and therefore the holonomy (which is
independent of U)—and with it the curvature—does indeed vanish, as it should:
R(bL)
=
δRU(bebf) + δRU(bfbg) + δRU(bgbh) + δRU(bhbe)
=
0 + (−δθ) + 0 + δθ
=
0.
But there is another way to determine the rotation of w|| relative to U, and it is this method
that we shall generalize to derive the general formula for K: we shall use local measurements of
distances within the coordinate grid—in other words, the metric.
The apparent rotation along bebf arises because the far side of the quadrilateral at radius r + δr
is longer than the near side, at radius r. How much longer? Well, the far side has length (r + δr) δθ,
while the near side has length r δθ, so, as illustrated, the increase in length is δr δθ.

27.3 Dry Run: Holonomy in the Flat Plane
•
265
[27.3] The fact that δRU(bhbe) = δθ can be deduced from the metric fact that this side is shorter than the opposite
side by δr δθ. The circulation of V around the loop in the map plane yields the (vanishing) holonomy on the
(ﬂat) surface on the right.
If we think of this as ultimately equal to a small arc of the illustrated circle (of radius δr)
centred at bh passing through bg, then this increase in length subtends an angle at bh that is the
rotation that we seek:
−δRU(bfbg) ≍
arc
radius ≍increase in side length
orthogonal side
= δr δθ
δr
= δθ.
More generally, if we call the side length δY ≍B δv, then the increase δ2Y resulting from
increasing u by δu will be
δ2Y ≍[BuB δu] δv.
In the present case, B = r, u = r, and v = θ, and therefore
δ2Y ≍[BuB δu] δv = [Brr δr] δθ = δr δθ,
as it should.
Before we turn to the general case of a curved surface, let us reinterpret what we have done,
but now in the (r, θ) map plane on the left of [27.3]. On each leg of the loop L, the rotation on S is
given by
δRU(edge) = 0 δr + (−1) δθ =

#
·

.
The vector ﬁeld V =
"

#
is illustrated in the map plane of [27.3]. We now recognize the fact
the holonomy of the loop on S is equal to the circulation of V around the loop in the map plane.
The ﬂow of V is perpendicular to the top and bottom edges, so they contribute nothing to the
circulation. But V does ﬂow directly along the edge he, and it ﬂows directly against the edge fg,
and these two contributions are exactly equal and opposite to each other.
In summary,
R(bL) = CL(V).

266
•
Chapter 27 Geometric Proof of the Metric Curvature Formula
As we shall now see, in the general case, too, it is possible to visualize the holonomy of a loop
on a curved surface S as the circulation of a vector ﬁeld V around the corresponding loop in the
(u, v) map plane, but in this case the circulation will generally not vanish, corresponding to the
presence of curvature within the loop on S
27.4
Holonomy as the Circulation of a Metric-Induced
Vector Field in the Map
In this section we will generalize the above argument and derive a formula for the holonomy R(bL)
of a simple loop bL on S in terms of the circulation CL(V) of a special vector ﬁeld V—determined
by the metric—around the corresponding loop L in the (u, v)-map.
Let R denote the small rectangle (with boundary L = efgh) shown in the map plane of [27.3]
(with centre p) only now with general (u, v)-coordinates, and so with sides δu and δv. This maps
to a curvilinear quadrilateral bR on the curved surface S with corresponding “centre” bp.
Since the sides of bR are ultimately δX ≍A δu and δY ≍B δv, the area δ b
A of bR is ultimately
related to the area δA = δu δv of R by,
δ b
A ≍δX δY ≍(Aδu)(Bδv) = (AB) δA.
(27.4)
In other words, as we pass from the map to the surface, the local area expansion factor is AB.
As R shrinks down to the centre point p, bR shrinks down to the point bp, so that to the naked
eye it will appear to be a true, plane rectangle. However, in order to investigate curvature we
must place bR under a powerful microscope of magniﬁcation (1/δu)—or (1/δv)—in which case it
becomes clear that the lengths of opposite edges of this “rectangle” differ from each other, if only
very slightly.
At this point, to follow along more vividly, we strongly encourage you to draw a small “rect-
angle” bR on an orange, apple, or grapefruit, perhaps using ordinary spherical polar coordinates to
create your grid, by drawing circles of longitude and latitude. You may then parallel transport a
toothpick along one of the edges of bR, and watch how it appears to rotate relative to the coordinate
grid you have chosen to draw on your fruit’s surface.
Figure [27.4] shows the vertices of bR orthogonally projected onto the osculating plane of S at
any interior point of bR, say bp. We have connected these with straight lines to form a quadrilateral.
Note that while the (u, v)-coordinate curves on the surface are always orthogonal, the sides of
this projected quadrilateral are not orthogonal. But as R shrinks, so too does bR, and its form is
ultimately a rectangle. Here we have deliberately drawn a rather extreme deviation from this
limiting case, in order to make the geometrical reasoning easier to follow.
Using the same notation as in the previous subsection, let δ2X = δ[δX] denote the increase in
δX, as illustrated. This δ2-notation serves to remind us that we are now dealing with a second-order
inﬁnitesimal, as is made manifest by this:
δ2X ≍[BvA δv] δu.
As [27.4] demonstrates, δ2X is ultimately equal to the arc of the circle of radius δY ≍B δv,
subtending the angle δR1 at be. Therefore the small holonomy resulting from the change δu in the
map is ultimately given by
δR1 ≍

in which both BvA and B are understood to be evaluated at the centre p of R, as R shrinks

Exactly the same reasoning applies to the holonomy resulting from the change δv in the map,

However, if BuB is positive—as we have drawn it to be in [27.4]—then the resulting rotation δR2

To obtain the holonomy of a simple closed loop bL on S, we must integrate this formula along
its image L in the (u, v)-map. We have thus arrived at this important result:
Let S be a surface with metric dbs2 = A2 du2 + B2 dv2, and let bL be a simple loop
on S, represented by the simple loop L in the (u, v)-map plane. If in the map plane
we deﬁne the vector ﬁeld

You may easily verify [exercise] that this general result is in accord with the special case
illustrated in [27.3].

But (27.3) now tells us that the bracketed term on the right—namely, the local circulation per unit

the most elegant and explicit manifestations of Gauss’s Theorema Egregium of 1827:

Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
28.1
Introduction to the Jacobi Equation
This chapter introduces a brand new interpretation of curvature, one that is critically important in
Einstein’s curved-spacetime theory of gravity. The idea is to look at the separation of neighbouring
unit-speed geodesics, and to examine their relative acceleration, which may be towards each other
(attraction), or away from each other (repulsion).
[28.1] Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851).
We ﬁrst examine this phenomenon in the
three principal cases of constant curvature, and we
then go on to analyse a general surface of vari-
able curvature. In this general case, we will provide
two different geometric proofs of the fundamen-
tal equation that governs this relative acceleration,
called the Equation of Geodesic Deviation, or the
Jacobi Equation, named after Carl Gustav Jacob
Jacobi—pictured in [28.1]—who discovered it in
1837.
As we shall see, the essential insight is that if
two neighbouring geodesics pass through a region
of positive curvature, they are attracted to each other.
If these two geodesics are launched from a com-
mon point of origin o, in slightly different direc-
tions, this attractive force arising from the positive
curvature may cause them to be focused back
to a second intersection point, called a conjugate
point of o.
On the other hand, neighbouring geodesics travelling through a region of negative curvature
are repelled by each other, accelerating apart.
In both cases, the force of attraction or repulsion is directly proportional to the separation of the
geodesics, and (locally) the proportionality “constant” is equal to the curvature of the surface at the
location of the particle!
This is essence of Jacobi’s discovery.
28.1.1
Zero Curvature: The Plane
Consider [28.2a], which shows a particle with position p(t) travelling at unit speed along a
geodesic straight line L in the plane, with unit velocity v =.p. It also shows a neighbouring parallel
geodesic eL, traced by ep, with velocity ev.

ξ = 0, again.
Obviously in this case ev = v, so δv =.
ξ = 0, but in the general case the equation simply says that the
difference of the two velocities is the velocity with which eL departs from L.
The focus of our attention in this chapter will not be on the relative velocity, but rather on the
relative acceleration:
..
ξ = d(δv)
dt
= relative acceleration.
(28.1)
In [28.2a] we ﬁnd (trivially) that..
ξ = 0.
Next, consider [28.2b], in which L and eL are now rays emanating from their common point
of origin o, separated by a small angle δθ. These geodesics are spreading out, diverging from
each other, but they are doing so at a steady rate δθ. The diagram explains this by geometrically
constructing δv as the connecting vector from the tip of v to the tip of ev, which is ultimately equal
to the arc of the circle of radius |v| = 1, subtending the angle δθ at o.
We can also deduce this symbolically. If r = op, then the unit speed of p along L can be written
|v| =.r = 1. Since |ξ| ≍r δθ, the speed of separation |.
ξ| ≍|(r δθ).| = δθ.
Thus, even though these geodesics diverge from each other, they do so without any force
pushing them apart—their relative acceleration vanishes:
..
ξ = 0.
As we shall come to see, this vanishing of the relative acceleration of neighbouring geodesics is a
new manifestation of the plane’s vanishing curvature.
28.1.2
Positive Curvature: The Sphere
Consider [28.3]. We launch two particles from the north pole N of a sphere of radius R, the angle
between them being δθ. Recall that if the particles are stuck to the surface but are not subjected to
any sideways forces within the surface, they will automatically follow geodesics of the surface, in
this case, great circles.
After time t the particle with position p(t) on one of these geodesics will have travelled
distance r = t over the surface, subtending angle ϕ at the centre of the sphere. Thus p(t) lies on the

But since the curvature of the sphere is K =
+(1/R2), this result can be written in the follow-
ing remarkably compact and elegant form, called the
Equation of Geodesic Deviation, or the
Jacobi Equation:
..
ξ = −K ξ.
(28.2)
We have merely proved the special case of this equation in the case where K is constant (and
positive), but soon we will be able to prove that it is true on a general surface of variable curvature.
In the general case we must take K in the equation to be K(p), i.e., the curvature at the location of
the particle as it travels across the surface along the geodesic.
There is much more to be said about this example before we move on. First, for some readers,
(28.2) may already be ringing a loud, harmonic bell! For this Equation of Geodesic Deviation also
goes by a quite different name—it is the equation of the harmonic oscillator, which is ubiquitous
in physics, in both the classical and quantum realms.
It is easy enough to create your own personal harmonic oscillator at home. Take a rubber
band (or spring) and attach one end to the underside of a table. Now attach a small object (which
we shall take to have unit mass) to the other end, and gently lower it until it hangs in equilibrium,
the downward pull of gravity being balanced by the upward pull of the stretched rubber band or
spring.
Now launch the weight straight down from this equilibrium position, thereby stretching the
rubber band or spring. In 16761 Robert Hooke (a contemporary and a rival of Newton) discovered
that the force pulling the weight back up is proportional to the displacement ξ from the equilibrium
position—this is called Hooke’s Law, and the proportionality constant k is called the stiffness of
the rubber band or spring.
1In fact Hooke merely laid claim to his discovery in 1676, without revealing what he had discovered, publishing it as an incom-
prehensible Latin anagram: “ceiiinosssttuv”! Only in 1678 did he reveal the solution to his anagram: ut tensio, sic vis (“as the
extension, so the force”).

Chapter 28 Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
Newton’s Second Law of Motion now yields exactly the same equation of motion as Jacobi’s
Equation, (28.2), but with the surface’s curvature replaced by the spring’s stiffness:
..
ξ = −k ξ,
with solution
ξ = ξ0 sin(
√
kt),
where ξ0 denotes the maximum extension, occurring at the moment that the spring halts the
downward motion and starts pulling the weight back up.
The appropriateness of the name harmonic oscillator is clear from this experiment and from
the mathematical solution above: the weight oscillates up and down, sinusoidally, achieving its
maximum speed (equal to its launch speed) each time it passes through the original equilibrium
position, ξ = 0.
Now, with this mathematically perfect physical analogy in mind, let us return to [28.3]. First,
notice that immediately after we launch the two particles, they appear to diverge at the same
(acceleration-free) rate they would in the plane, as illustrated in [28.2b]. This is clear geometrically,
but can also be conﬁrmed by noting that sin ϵ ≍ϵ, and therefore, as r goes to zero,
ξ = R δθ sin
 r
R

≍R δθ
 r

= r δθ.
Despite the fact that the particles are moving freely over the surface, as their separation grows
the curvature effectively exerts an attractive force that is exactly like a spring, and this mysterious
curvature “force” starts to slow their separation.
As the separation grows, so does the force of attraction, in direct proportion, and hence the
speed of separation is reduced more rapidly, until, ﬁnally, the relative speed drops to zero, just
as the particles reach maximum separation at the equator. (This corresponds to the weight being
at its lowest point, with the spring at maximum extension.) The attraction is now at maximum
strength, and it starts pulling the geodesics back together again, until they are ﬁnally focussed to
a second intersection point at the south pole, S—this is called the conjugate point of N.
As the particles converge and intersect at S (where ξ = 0) they achieve maximum relative
speed, just as our oscillating weight achieves maximum speed as it passes through the equilibrium
point, ξ = 0.
This journey from N to S is only one-half of a complete ξ-oscillation, the remaining half being
completed on the back side of the sphere, with the direction of ξ now reversed, as illustrated,
switching over from pointing to the left of p’s trajectory to its right.
Once the particles have returned to N, the ξ-oscillation begins anew, and repeats forever.
28.1.3
Negative Curvature: The Pseudosphere
Just as geodesics are attracted to each other on the positively curved sphere, so they are repelled
by each other on the negatively curved pseudosphere. To make this especially clear, [28.4a] shows
two neighbouring geodesics being launched from the rim in the “same” direction (in the sense
that .
ξ(0) = 0). Soon, however, the repulsive negative curvature makes itself felt, and we see the
geodesics ﬂying apart.
But in order to calculate the relative acceleration with ease, we shall instead consider [28.4b],
which shows two neighbouring particles on the rim being launched straight up the pseudosphere
at unit speed, so that they are approaching each other as they travel along their respective tractrix
generators, the arc length being equal to the time: σ = t.
The initial velocities of the particles are horizontal, both pointing at the centre o of the rim,
distance R away. Since they are travelling at unit speed, in the absence of force they should there-
fore collide at time t = R. But clearly they don’t collide, . . . ever! Yes, the two tractrix generators

metry axis to obtain the other, then their initial small

This equation leads directly to the Jacobi Equation,
without even needing to solve it ﬁrst!
To see how, we rephrase the equation in terms

Thus the initial approach speed is |ξ0|/R, and there-

Chapter 28 Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
The fact that the particles do not in fact collide is due to the repulsive force arising from the neg-
ative curvature. This is conﬁrmed by differentiating a second time, once again arriving at Jacobi’s

The last equality follows from the fact that the pseudosphere has constant negative curvature,

The above argument can easily be generalized to prove that the Jacobi Equation holds on all
surfaces for revolution, but we leave this for you to conﬁrm, in Exercise 8. Instead, we now move
on to establish the result in the general case, for a surface without any symmetries.
28.2
Two Proofs of the Jacobi Equation
28.2.1
Geodesic Polar Coordinates
Figure [28.3] may be viewed as providing a novel interpretation of ordinary spherical polar
coordinates on S2.
We simultaneously launch particles in all possible directions from the north pole, so that
every point of S2 (other than the poles) is uniquely speciﬁed by which particle hits it, and when.
In greater detail, which particle hits the point can be speciﬁed by the longitude angle θ that the
launch direction makes with some particular2 (but arbitrary) direction, deﬁned to be θ = 0. When
the particle hits the point is speciﬁed by the latitude angle ϕ = σ = t (assuming now that R = 1).
Geodesic polar coordinates are the natural generalization of this idea to an arbitrary surface,
S. See [28.6], which illustrates the idea in the case that S is a torus. From an arbitrary point3 o on
S, launch particles at unit speed in all directions, so that they travel outward along geodesics, and
choose one of these to be θ = 0. Provided the region surrounding o is not so large that it contains
any conjugate points, then every point within it is hit by a unique particle at a unique time. If that
particle is launched in direction θ and hits the point at time t, then we can assign to that point the
unique geodesic polar coordinates (t, θ).
Both in the plane and on the sphere, we know that the intrinsic circle K(σ) with intrinsic
radius σ = t = const. is orthogonal to its “radii,” i.e., the geodesic segments of length σ emanating
from its centre o. It turns out that this remains true on a general surface, as illustrated in [28.6].
Gauss (1827, §15) proved this on his way to proving other results, and so it has become known as
Gauss’s Lemma. If particles are launched in all directions from a point on a
general surface, travelling out a distance σ along geodesics, they will form (by
deﬁnition) a geodesic circle K(σ) with intrinsic radius σ. This geodesic circle
K(σ) cuts its geodesic radii at right angles.
(28.4)
Vector Calculus would not be developed by Gibbs and Heaviside4 till the 1880s, so in 1827
Gauss was forced to prove this by means of a full page of computation. (A much shorter and
2On planet Earth we call θ = 0 the prime meridian, and deﬁne it to be the one passing through the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich, London, England. Since 1999, this direction has been marked by particles of light (from a powerful green laser)
launched northward across the London night sky!
3We now drop the hat for points on S, because we no longer need to distinguish them from points in the map.

α ̸= 0. As explained in the text, this leads to a contradiction.
more transparent version of this now-standard computation—based upon the extrinsic fact that
the acceleration of the geodesics is normal to the surface—can be found in Ex. 9.) But immediately
after completing his computational proof, Gauss did something completely uncharacteristic: he
offered a second proof that was instead intuitive and geometrical. Furthermore, this second proof
was intrinsic.
We can only speculate that Gauss did this because he thought this second proof was especially
important, or because he was especially proud of his geometrical ingenuity. In any event, here is
the evidence, in Gauss’s own words: “We have thought it worthwhile to deduce this theorem from
the fundamental property of shortest lines; but the truth of the theorem can be made apparent
without any calculation by means of the following reasoning.”
We shall now present this reasoning, which appears to have been completely lost in the mists
of time—indeed, we have yet to discover a single instance of its reincarnation in any modern text.
This is perhaps due to the fact that Gauss expressed his reasoning in terms of inﬁnitesimals, thereby
wrongfooting modern mathematicians. In place of Gauss’s inﬁnitesimals, we shall instead employ
Newtonian ultimate equalities between small, ultimately vanishing quantities. Also, in contrast to
the ever-unsolicitous Gauss (1827, §15), we have supplied a diagram in order to see what Gauss
meant!
Suppose we launch two neighbouring geodesics from o, the small (ultimately vanishing)
angle between them being δθ. These are the two darker geodesic segments shown in [28.6] that
terminate at p and q. Suppose that p and q both lie on K(R)—i.e, the geodesic segments op and
oq have the same length σ = R. But now imagine (as illustrated) that pq is not ultimately orthogonal
to op and oq (as δθ →0), contrary to Gauss’s Lemma. Following Gauss, we now show that this is
impossible, thereby proving (28.4).

276
•
Chapter 28 Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
Suppose that ∠opq ≍(π/2) −α, as illustrated. Now draw the geodesic through q orthogonal
to pq, and let its intersection with op be r, as shown. Then ∠prq ≍α, and therefore rq ≍rp cos α.
(Here, and in the following, “rq” is serving double duty, standing for both the segment, and the
length of the segment, the context making clear which is meant.)
Therefore,
length of o ù r ù q
=
or + rq
≍
(R −rp) + rp cos α

R −rp(1 −cos α)

R.
Thus this indirect route from o to q (via r) is shorter than the shortest route, the direct geodesic route,
oq. Gauss has his contradiction!
Having established the orthogonality of the (t, θ) coordinates, the metric takes the form
dbs2 = dt2 + ρ2(t, θ) dθ2.
Thus if δθ is the angular separation of two neighbouring geodesics launched from o, then
|ξ| ≍ρ δθ

Combining this result with (28.5), we have proved the Jacobi Equation, (28.2):

Finally, we remark that (28.6) also allows us to ﬁnally prove Minding’s Theorem (alluded to on
p. 21), which states that if two surfaces have the same constant curvature, then they are locally
isometric. (See Ex. 7 for the details.)
28.2.2
Relative Acceleration = Holonomy of Velocity
While our ﬁrst proof of the Jacobi Equation was extremely brief (once Gauss’s Lemma was estab-
lished), it did require the full force of the (“Star Trek phaser”) formula, (27.1). As we shall now see,
there was actually no need to “set phasers to kill”! In its place, we now present a second proof that
is direct, geometrical, and intuitive.
Indeed, the title of this subsection is that proof, albeit in aphoristic form. We now spell out
the details, using [28.7], which uses the same notation as in [28.2]. This ﬁgure reuses the surface
from our proof of Clairaut’s Theorem, [11.7], but seen now with new eyes. Speciﬁcally, we see that
the meridian geodesic generators L and eL (through a and the neighbouring point ea) are attracted
to each other initially in the region of positive curvature, but are then repelled from each as they
enter the negative curvature region in the neck of the vase. (NOTE: The following argument is
completely general, and does not rely on or make any use of the symmetry of this particular
surface.)

[28.7] Geometric Proof of the Jacobi Equation. Parallel
transporting v||(eb) around L returns it to eb rotated by the
holonomy δψ = R(L) ≍K δA ≍K |ξ| δt. But δψ ≍
|δv| ≍|..
ξ | δt, and the Jacobi Equation follows.
Let
ξ
connect
two
neighbouring
geodesics, L and eL, launched with unit
speed, perpendicular to a short geodesic
segment aea, as illustrated. This ensures
that L and eL start out parallel, in the sense
that initially they remain the same dis-
tance apart, with zero rate of separation:
.
ξ = 0. (NOTE: We have drawn the sepa-
ration fairly large in order to make the
subsequent geometric reasoning easier to
follow, but ultimately we will let the gap
aea go to zero, so ξ will ultimately be a gen-
uine tangent vector that can be pictured as
lying within the surface.)
After time δt both particles will have
travelled distance δt across the surface,
arriving at b and eb, respectively. By then
the relative velocity .
ξ between L and eL
has increased from zero to δv ≍..
ξ δt, by
virtue of the deﬁnition, (28.1).
Presumably δv should here be inter-
preted as the difference [ev(eb) −v(b)] bet-
ween the new velocities. However, this
does not make intrinsic sense, since we
cannot subtract tangent vectors to S that
emanate from different points and lie with
different tangent planes. In order to com-
pare them, let us join b to eb with a short geodesic5 segment beb and then parallel transport v(b)
along beb to obtain v||(eb) at eb, as illustrated. We thereby obtain an intrinsic measure of the relative
acceleration:
..
ξ δt ≍δv = ev(eb) −v||(eb).
As illustrated, let δψ be the angle between these two vectors at eb. Since the arc (not shown)
of the unit circle centred at eb through the tips of these vectors is ultimately equal to the chord
connecting those tips, we see that
|δv| ≍δψ.
Now we come to the crux of the matter. As illustrated, let us deﬁne L to be the counterclockwise
loop around the boundary of the shaded quadrilateral: L ≡ebbaeaeb. Starting at eb, let us parallel
transport v||(eb) around L.
First, since v||(eb) was originally obtained by parallel transporting v(b) along beb, it follows
that parallel transporting it back again along ebb will return it to its original state, v(b). Next, since
the velocity of a geodesic is parallel transported along itself, parallel transport along ba yields
v(a) at a. Next, parallel transport along the geodesic aea maintains orthogonality with it, so it
arrives at ea as ev(ea). Finally, parallel transport along the geodesic eaeb returns it to its starting point
as ev(eb), so parallel transport around L has rotated v by δψ.
5This choice makes the argument easier to follow, but we will ultimately take the limit that the segment shrinks to zero, so the
precise nature of the segment does not matter.

278
•
Chapter 28 Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
In other words,
The relative acceleration of the geodesics is measured by the rotation δψ of the
velocity vector, but this is none other than the holonomy of the velocity when it
is parallel transported around L. In brief, δψ = R(L)!
Since the area δA inside L is given by δA ≍|ξ| δt, the proof of the Jacobi Equation comes
down to the following sequence of ultimate equalities, each of which should now be visually
apparent:
|..
ξ | δt ≍|δv| ≍δψ = R(L) ≍K δA ≍K|ξ| δt.
Cancelling δt, and taking into account the fact that δv points in the opposite direction to ξ for the
illustrated case of positive K, we have arrived again at the Jacobi Equation:
..
ξ = −K ξ.
28.3
The Circumference and Area of a Small Geodesic Circle
In Section 2.2 we showed that, on the sphere, the inhabitants of the surface could determine the
curvature of their world by examining carefully either the circumference C(r) or the area A(r) of a
small circle K(r) of intrinsic radius r. In both cases, the key to ﬁnding the curvature was to detect
how these quantities departed from their Euclidean values of C(r) = 2πr and A(r) = πr2.
Speciﬁcally, we proved that in the limit that r vanishes, the curvature is given by (2.4) and
(2.5), which we repeat here, for the convenience of the reader:

(28.8)
We claimed at the time that these formulas apply to all surfaces, not merely the sphere, and
we are now ﬁnally in a position to prove this.
With the same geodesic polar coordinates as before, let ξ(r) denote the separation of the
geodesics launched at angle θ0 and θ0 + δθ, so that if we deﬁne
g(r) ≡ρ(θ0, r)
then
ξ(r) ≍g(r) δθ.
As r →0, we know this reduces to the Euclidean formula, ξ(r) ≍r δθ, but it is precisely the small
departure from this Euclidean result that we must detect in order to measure the non-Euclidean-
ness, aka the curvature.

To that end, we expand g(r) into a Maclaurin series:
g(r) = r + 1
2g′′(0) r2 + 1
6g′′′(0) r3 + · · · .
But (28.6) tells us that g′′(r) = −Kg(r), so g′′(0) = 0, and also
g′′′(0) = [−Kg]′(0) = −K′(0)g(0) −K(0)g′(0) = −K(0).
Thus,
C(r) = 2π g(r) = 2πr −π
3 K(0) r3 + · · · ,
and (28.7) follows immediately.
Finally, the area δA of an annulus of geodesic width δr is given by
δA ≍C(r) δr,
so integration of the formula for C(r) readily yields [exercise] the area formula, (28.8).

Riemann’s Curvature
29.1
Introduction and Summary
In this chapter we shall see how the forgoing insights concerning 2-dimensional surfaces can be
extended naturally to n-dimensional spaces, called manifolds.
Just as our 2-dimensional surfaces are locally described by their tangent planes, each of which
has the structure of R2, so the immediate vicinity of a point in an n-dimensional manifold locally
resembles Rn, but distances between neighbouring points are measured with a metric1 that is not
Euclidean.
• First, we shall extend to an n-manifold (shorthand for an n-dimensional manifold) our very
ﬁrst measure of the intrinsic curvature K(p) of a 2-surface, namely, the local angular excess per
unit area of a small geodesic triangle ∆as it shrinks to a point p:
K(p) = lim
∆→p
E(∆)
A(∆).
• Second, it turns out that the angular excess is too blunt an instrument to give direct in-
sight into the more subtle curvature(s!) of an n-manifold. However, the holonomy resulting from
parallel-transporting a vector around a small shrinking loop is able to fully reveal this more intri-
cate curvature structure, in a very direct way. Clearly, then, the next step towards deﬁning the
curvature of an n-manifold must be to understand parallel transport in such a space.
Generalizing parallel transport from 2-surfaces to n-manifolds is nontrivial, and yet it is given
scant attention in almost every standard text we have examined. To redress the balance, we shall
provide three different geometrical constructions (all leading to the same result) that can be used
to generalize Levi-Civita’s parallel transport to such an n-manifold.
• Third, we use parallel transport to deﬁne the intrinsic (aka “covariant”) derivative within
an n-manifold. The good news is that—when expressed in intrinsic terms—the passage from a
2-surface to an n-manifold requires absolutely no change to our original deﬁnition (23.2); only the
notation changes, writing ∇v in place of Dv.
• Fourth—and this is the beating heart of the chapter—we use parallel transport to generalize
holonomy from 2-dimensional surfaces to n-manifolds.
Riemann, pictured in [29.1], discovered that in place of Gauss’s single number K character-
izing a 2-surface, his generalized intrinsic curvature of an n-manifold is speciﬁed by an array

1The fully general conception of a manifold does not actually require that distance be deﬁned within it. For our purposes,
however, the metric is the central structure to be investigated, so we must insist that our manifolds have metrics! The technical
name for a manifold with a positive-deﬁnite metric is a Riemannian manifold, and a manifold with metric that can yield
negative (“distance”)2, as is the case for spacetime, is called pseudo-Riemannian. Rather than constantly stating explicitly that
our manifolds are either Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian, we shall merely let it be understood that our manifolds have
metrics: they will always be either Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian.
2This is proved in Exercise 11.

distinct curvature components: these form
the numerical description of a geometrical
object called the Riemann tensor.
In a 2-dimensional surface the Riemann
tensor therefore reduces (with n = 2) to a
single component, and this is simply K.
The room in which you now sit appears to
be 3-dimensional, and therefore the space
around you (with n = 3) is described by six
curvature components. However, as you sit
still in your chair, you are actually hurtling
into the future, along the fourth dimension,
time! In Einstein’s 4-dimensional, curved
spacetime, there are 20 curvature compo-
nents, and, as we shall see in the next chap-
ter, these describe the gravitational ﬁeld!
• Fifth, we shall see how to generalize the Jacobi Equation to an n-manifold.
• Sixth, we shall describe a particularly important, geometrically meaningful average of Rie-
mann’s curvatures, called the Ricci curvature tensor. In Einstein’s curved, 4-dimensional space-
time, this captures exactly half of the complete curvature information (10 components out of
20 total).
29.2
Angular Excess in an n-Manifold
Our study of 2-surfaces has provided the essential springboard to understand n-manifolds. But a
2-surface is simply too special to manifest the full variety of phenomena that can and do occur in
n-manifolds.
However, very happily, it turns out that essentially all3 the fundamentally new features and con-
cepts of n-manifolds are revealed if we merely go up one dimension, to a readily-visualizable 3-manifold,
such as the space you currently sit in. We shall therefore focus our attention initially on this very
concrete case, but in the next chapter we shall increase the dimension yet again, from three to four,
in order to understand Einstein’s curved spacetime.
We have gained many important insights into our 2-surfaces by viewing them as embedded
in R3. And while it is certainly possible to conceive of our 3-manifold as likewise embedded in a
higher dimensional space, there is no longer any visual advantage to doing so. Furthermore, with
our eye on the prize of understanding Einstein’s curved spacetime, our focus will be solely on
intrinsic properties of an n-manifold, as determined by its intrinsic metric. Therefore, henceforth, we
shall always assume that we are creatures living within the n-manifold, and only intrinsic measurements
within it are meaningful.
3There are a few phenomena that only appear once we reach dimension n = 4. For example, the vitally important Weyl
curvature tensor, described in Exercise 15, only exists if n ⩾4.

Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
Our very ﬁrst measure of intrinsic curvature was via the angular excess E(∆) of a geo-
desic triangle ∆. But to construct a geodesic triangle ∆, the ﬁrst thing we need are the geo-
desics themselves! On a 2-surface, we constructed a geodesic by stretching a string over4
the surface. In a 3-manifold, we simply stretch the string between two points, thereby obtain-
ing a seemingly straight line between them. Alternatively, we may shoot a laser beam
from one point to the other. But we no longer assume that our 3-manifold is the Euclidean R3;
instead, it is equipped with a general, non-Euclidean metric, so stetched strings and laser beams can
no longer be relied upon to behave as expected. Indeed, as we shall discuss in the next chapter,
the bending of “straight” light rays was one of the ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmations (in 1919) of
Einstein’s prediction that the geometry of physical space is curved.

[29.2] Geodesic triangles constructed in three perpendicular
coordinate planes of a 3-manifold reveal only part of the cur-
vature structure of the space. Here, E(∆1) < 0, E(∆2) = 0, and
E(∆3) > 0.
In a 2-surface, there was only
one possible choice for the plane
of our ∆. But in our 3-manifold,
there are clearly inﬁnitely many
planes to choose from, one for each
choice of the normal vector. The
curvature within such a slice of
space is called a sectional curvature,
and is the subject of Section 29.5.8.
Figure [29.2] illustrates three such
sectional curvatures in three orthog-
onal coordinate planes in a 3-mani-
fold: they are all independent, both
as regards their magnitudes and
their signs. Here we have illustrated
three geodesic triangles ∆i with a
common vertex, but each lying in a
different coordinate plane. As illus-
trated, here K(∆1) < 0, K(∆2) = 0,
and K(∆3) > 0.
But we have already stated that
the Riemann tensor of a 3-manifold
has six curvature components, so
the angular excess in these three
coordinate planes has only been able
to detect half of the curvature struc-
ture. Things only get worse as the dimension increases: in a 4-manifold, the angular excess in
the six different coordinate planes only yields six curvatures, whereas the Riemann tensor has 20
curvature components.
To explore curvature, in all its glory, it is essential that we instead turn to holonomy. To that
end, we must now grapple with the nontrivial task of generalizing parallel transport from a 2-
surface to an n-manifold. By virtue of its fundamental importance, we now offer not one, but three
different geometrical constructions!
29.3
Parallel Transport: Three Constructions
29.3.1
Closest Vector on Constant-Angle Cone
Recall that in order to parallel transport a vector w(p) along a curve in a 2-surface, the fundamental
intrinsic construction takes this curve to be a geodesic G. (To parallel transport along a general

vectors at q making angle α with G, then pick the

curve, we break it down into geodesic seg-
ments.) To achieve parallel transport along G,
it is only necessary to keep the angle α between
w|| and G constant (and keep the length of w||
constant).
In a 3-manifold, this construction imme-
diately runs into trouble. See [29.3]. Suppose
we try to carry w(p) a short distance ϵ along
G from p to q to create the parallel vec-
tor w||(p ù q), and all we know is that α
remains constant, and the length w|| remains
constant. Then w||(p ù q) could lie any-
where on the illustrated cone C of directions;
which generator of C should we pick?
For this construction, and for each of the
other constructions that follow, it sufﬁces to
ask ourselves how we would do the analo-
gous construction in R3, for as ϵ →0 the two constructions must agree. Well, in R3, the generator
of C that is parallel to wo is the one that is closest. That is, as illustrated,
w||(p ù q) is the generator of C whose tip is closest to the tip of w(p).
By repeating this process over and over, we may parallel-transport w(p) as far as we wish
along G.
29.3.2
Constant Angle within a Parallel-Transported Plane
The next construction, which we have only ever seen described by Arnol’d (1989, pp. 305–306),
again draws its inspiration from R3.

[29.4] We construct the “plane” Π(p) by launch-
ing geodesics from p in all directions spanned by
w(p) and v(p). We then (approximately) parallel-
transport Π(p) to q to form Π||(p ù q), gener-
ated by geodesics emanating from q and passing
through neighbouring points of Π(p).
To parallel-transport w(p) along a Eucli-
dean straight line G in R3, with tangent v, let
Π(p) be the plane spanned by w(p) and v(p),
the angle between the two vectors being α, as
before. Now parallel-transport Π(p) along G to
obtain Π||. Finally, parallel-transport w(p) along
G as the unique vector in Π|| making angle α
with v.
Of course in R3 this is a perverse waste of
time, for we have an absolute parallelism that
allows us to move w(p) along G without the
assistance of Π||. However, this now suggests
a new construction in a curved 3-manifold (or
n-manifold). See [29.4].
In R3, Π(p) was made up of all the straight
line emanating from p whose directions were
linear combinations of v(p) and w(p). By anal-
ogy, in our curved 3-manifold, let Π(p) now
denote the “plane” made up of all the geodesics
emanating from p whose directions are linear
combinations of v(p) and w(p); of course this “plane” is actually a curved 2-surface. Note that
this surface Π(p) necessarily contains G, the geodesic in the direction v(p).

284
•
Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
As in the previous construction, let q lie ϵ along G. By construction, Π(p) necessarily con-
tains q and the new direction of G at q, namely v(q). If we zoom in on the small region of Π(p)
surrounding q, it looks like a Euclidean plane. We can now construct a new surface Π||(p ù q)—
the parallel translation of Π(p) to q—by launching geodesics out from q in all directions within
this small planar region of Π(p) surrounding q. Figure [29.4] illustrates a few of these geodesics
(dashed), launched from q and passing through nearby (black dot) points of Π(p). To be more
precise, the geodesic generators of Π||(p ù q) are obtained by taking the limit that the black dots
are pulled into q.
Repeating this construction over and over, we may approximate parallel-transport of Π(p)
down the length of G. Finally, letting ϵ →0, we obtain a continuously varying, parallel-transported
2-surface Π|| along the length of G, and then,
To parallel transport w(p) along the geodesic G, we keep its length constant, and
maintain its angle α with G, while always keeping it tangent to the parallel-
transported 2-surface Π||.
29.3.3
Schild’s Ladder
Our ﬁnal construction is also the simplest. It was ﬁrst stated by Alfred Schild (1921–1977) in an
(unpublished) Princeton lecture in 1970, and was later named Schild’s Ladder in Misner, Thorne,
and Wheeler (1973).
On a 2-surface, it has often been helpful for us to imagine that a very short tangent vector
(that actually lives in the R2 tangent plane to the surface) instead lies in the surface. Likewise, in
an n-manifold, a very short vector in the Rn tangent space can be imagined to be in the manifold.
Therefore, since parallel-transport (by deﬁnition) preserves length, if we wish to parallel-transport
a long tangent vector at p, we may ﬁrst shrink it by some large factor N in the Rn tangent space at p,
then picture it as living in the manifold, then parallel-transport it, then ﬁnally expand it by the same
large factor N in the Rn tangent space at the destination, thereby restoring its original length.
Schild’s Ladder construction uses this freedom to imagine that the vector w(p) that is to
be parallel-transported along the geodesic G is very short, and can therefore be pictured as a
very short geodesic segment in the manifold. With this understanding, the construction of Schild’s
Ladder is spelled out in the caption of [29.5], which illustrates it.
29.4
The Intrinsic (aka “Covariant”) Derivative ∇v
Previously, we used ∇v to denote the directional derivative in R3, and we used Dv to denote
the intrinsic derivative within the 2-surface. In extrinsic terms, we saw in (23.3) that Dv could be
viewed as the projection P of ∇v into the surface, along its normal n:
Dvw = P [∇vw] = ∇vw −(n·∇vw) n.
However, as we have noted, we shall not consider our n-manifold to be embedded in a higher-
dimensional space, so no analogue of the above formula will be sought or found. Instead, we will
think entirely intrinsically.
Fortunately, we already have an intrinsic deﬁnition of this intrinsic derivative in (23.2),
page 242, and we even drew a picture of it in [23.3]. Let us brieﬂy review that construction.
Our task is to ﬁnd the rate of change of a vector ﬁeld w as we move away from a point p in the
direction of a unit vector v. We move a small (ultimately vanishing) distance ϵ away from p along
ϵv, arriving at q. To see how much the new vector w(q) has changed from its original value w(p),

we parallel-transport it back from q to p as w||(q ù p). We then ﬁnd the change, [w||(q ù p) −w(p)],
and ﬁnally we divide by ϵ to ﬁnd the rate of change.
Now that we know how to do parallel transport [three ways!] in an n-manifold, we can deﬁne
the intrinsic (aka “covariant”) derivative in an n-manifold exactly as just described. Only the nota-
tion changes: henceforth, we adopt the standard choice of a bold nabla symbol—∇—to represent the
intrinsic derivative,
∇vw ≍w||(q ù p) −w(p)
ϵ
.
(29.2)
For our upcoming purposes, it will prove much more useful to think of the intrinsic derivative
not in terms of a rate of change, but rather more directly in terms of the actual change itself:

286
•
Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
w||(q ù p) −w(p) ≍ϵ∇vw = ∇ϵvw.
Let δpqw denote the small intrinsic change in w along the vector ϵ ≡ϵv from p to q, then
δpqw = intrinsic change inwfrom tail to tip of ϵ ≍∇ϵw.
(29.3)
It follows directly from this deﬁnition, that
∇vw|| = 0
⇐⇒
w||is parallel-transported alongv.
If v is the velocity of a geodesic, then it is parallel-transported along itself, so the Geodesic
Equation (23.5) now takes the form,
∇vv = 0.
(29.4)
We should note that if we allow the particle to speed up or slow down as it travels along the
geodesic, then we obtain a more general form of the geodesic equation, namely, ∇vv ∝v, which
says that the direction of v is intrinsically constant, but its magnitude is permitted to change.

The Riemann Curvature Tensor
29.5.1
Parallel Transport Around a Small “Parallelogram”
Just as we did in the case of 2-manifolds (surfaces) we can now study curvature in an n-manifold
by parallel-transporting a unit vector w|| around a small loop L. More speciﬁcally, we shall attempt
to construct L as a parallelogram whose edges are built out of two (unit) vector ﬁelds u and v.
Therefore, as illustrated in [29.6], starting at o, we lay out short vectors in these two direc-
tions, u(o) δu (connecting o to a) and v(o) δv (connecting o to p). In order to attempt to create a
parallelogram, we now lay out u(a) δu (connecting a to b) and v(p) δv (connecting p to q). But the
problem is that, in general, q ̸= b: the “parallelogram” fails to close!
In the next subsection we shall ﬁnd the formula for the extremely small “gap-closing” vector
c connecting b to q. For now, though, simply suppose that we know how to close this gap, and are
therefore able to parallel-transport w around the closed loop, L = oabqpo.
Within a 2-surface, the initial vector wo that is parallel-transported can only lie in the same
plane as u and v. The fundamentally new feature in a 3-manifold (or more generally an n-manifold)
is that w can now stick out of the plane of the small loop around which it is parallel-transported.
Having set the scene, let us parallel-transport wo around L as w||, returning it to o as w||(o).
We can then deﬁne the vector holonomy5 to be the net change in w|| induced by the curvature:
δw|| ≡w||(upon returning to o) −w(as it departs from o)
Within a 2-surface, we introduced the holonomy operator R(L), which (when applied to w)
gave the net rotation (holonomy) of w after it was parallel-transported around L. Now, in a
3-manifold, or indeed an n-manifold, there are inﬁnitely many different planes within which
L may lie. Furthermore, in a 2-surface the entire tangent plane rotated rigidly as the vectors within

[29.6] Geometric Meaning of Riemann’s Curvature. Starting at
o, we create a small parallelogram out of two vector ﬁelds u
and v, then parallel-transport an initial vector wo around the
loop L as w||. When it returns to o as w||(o), it has changed
by the illustrated vector holonomy δw|| = −R(u δu, v δv) w,
where R is the Riemann curvature operator.
it were parallel-transported, so we
did not need to pay attention to which
vector w was being transported: they
all rotated the same amount, R(L).
But in a 3-manifold, w can stick
out of the plane of L, and in an n-
manifold, there can be many inde-
pendent ways it can point. Crucially,
the vector holonomy now does depend
on which vector is parallel-transported
around the loop.
For both these reasons, we must
reﬁne and generalize our previous
notation, and introduce the Riem-
ann curvature operator R associated
with the edges of the parallelogram
L, which then acts on the vector that
is parallel-transported, yielding the
vector holonomy:
−δw|| ≡R(u δu, v δv) w.
As we know, the curvature K of a 2-surface is completely captured by the holonomy per unit
area. In an n-manifold we can likewise look at the angle δΘ between the initial vector wo and the
parallel-transported vector w||(o) when it returns to o, as illustrated in [29.6]. Since w is a unit
vector, the distance |δw| that its tip rotates is ultimately equal to δΘ, the angle of rotation.
For simplicity’s sake, suppose that u and v are orthogonal, so that our parallelogram is a
rectangle of area δA = δu δv. We can then generalize K and extract a scalar curvature K(u, v; w),
once again deﬁned as the rotation per unit area:
K(u, v; w) ≍δΘ
δA ≍
|δw|||
δA
≍|R(u, v) w| .
However, it is clear that this is no longer a satisfactory measure of the curvature, for we have
completely lost the crucial information about the direction of the vector holonomy δw||. As we
shall see, the Riemann tensor is the geometric object that encodes the full curvature information:
both the angle δΘ by which w|| tips away from wo, and the direction in which it does so.
29.5.2
Closing the “Parallelogram” with the Vector Commutator
The vector c that closes up our near-miss parallelogram is extremely small, being (at worst6) of
order δu δv, so ignoring it would still yield an excellent approximation to the curvature. But to
obtain a mathematically perfect description of the Riemann tensor, we must parallel transport our
vector around a closed loop, and therefore we must close the “parallelogram” with c.
As we see geometrically, directly from [29.7], this very short vector that closes up the gap in
the parallelogram can be expressed as the commutator7 of its edges:
6For vector ﬁelds tied to a coordinate grid, the gap disappears completely.
7Also called the Lie Bracket, after the great Norwegian mathematician, Sophus Lie (pronounced “lee”) (1842–1899).

288
•
Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
[29.7] Geometric proof that the vector c that closes up the gap in the “parallelogram” is the commutator of its
edges: c ≍∇vδv {u δu} −∇uδu {v δv} = [v , u] δu δv.
c ≍[v δv, uδu] =[v, u] δu δv,
where
[v, u] ≡∇vu −∇uv.
We note a simple fact which we will need very shortly, namely, that the commutator is antisym-
metric:
[v, u] = −[u, v].
29.5.3
The General Riemann Curvature Formula
We can now return to the problem of ﬁnding the change δw|| in w|| when it is parallel-transported
around the closed loop, L = oabqpo.
To motivate the following argument, let us brieﬂy review the ﬁrst crucial step in Hopf’s intrin-
sic proof of GGB—the introduction of the “holonomy” of an open curve. As illustrated in [26.1],
page 258, we introduced a ﬁducial vector ﬁeld U, enabling us to deﬁne RU(K) for the open curve
K to be the net change in the angle ∠Uw||—from U to the parallel-transported vector w||—as we
travel along K:
RU(K) ≡δK (∠Uw||).
As we noted at the time, the subscript U is essential, for RU(K) does indeed depend on our arbitrary
choice of U. Thus RU(K) has no true mathematical meaning; it was merely a stepping stone in
ﬁnding the geometrically meaningful holonomy of a closed loop.
Indeed, the holonomy R(L) of a closed polygonal loop L could then be expressed as the sum
of the “holonomies” of its edges, and while each of the individual holonomies did depend on the
arbitrary choice of U, their sum R(L) = K(L) measured the curvature within, and was independent
of U.

[29.8] The Riemann Curvature Tensor. To calculate the vector
holonomy, we introduce a ﬁducial vector ﬁeld w that is com-
pletely arbitrary, except that w(o) = wo; these are the black
and white vectors (only those along oa are shown). When
summed over all ﬁve edges, the changes in w relative to w||
yield the negative of the vector holonomy of the loop.
In a 2-surface we did not need
to specify the vector w that was
parallel-transported, because the entire
tangent plane rotated rigidly as we
moved across the surface. (This is no
longer true in a 3-manifold: the initial
choice of the direction of w does affect
its vector holonomy around a closed
loop.)
Still in a 2-surface, for the mo-
ment, we may choose w freely, so
let us choose w = U. Now consider
the negative of this holonomy—the
change in U relative to parallel-
transported vector U||—along a very
a short vector ϵ. Then the holonomy
becomes none other than the intrinsic
derivative of U:
−RU(ϵ) = δϵ (∠U||U)
≍∇ϵ (∠U||U) ≍|∇ϵ U|.
We can now return to the prob-
lem at hand and apply this insight to
the evaluation of −δw|| within the 3-manifold [29.6]. As illustrated in [29.8], we now introduce a
ﬁducial vector ﬁeld w throughout the region containing the parallelogram—these are the black-
and-white vectors, which we have only drawn along oa, to avoid clutter. This vector ﬁeld can be
completely arbitrary, except that now it does matter which vector wo is parallel-transported, so we
insist that w(o) = wo. Then, using (29.3), the negative of the vector holonomy along the ﬁrst edge
of the parallelogram is8
−δoaw|| = w(a) −w||(a) ≍∇uδuw(o) = δu ∇uw(o).
Let us now repeatedly apply (29.3) to sum these changes in the arbitrary vector ﬁeld w, rela-
tive the parallel-transported vector w||, along the ﬁve sides of the closed-up parallelogram. When
we return to o, of course w(o) has the same value as when we left o, so the net change in w relative
to w|| is entirely due to the absolute change in w||, and is independent of the arbitrary choice of the
vector ﬁeld w—this net change is the vector holonomy we seek.
We spell out every step of this summation, and encourage you to refer back to [29.8] to make
geometrical sense of each line. Having absorbed each separate step of this crucial argument, it is
worth your time to step back and grasp it as a single, complete idea:

8Here, and in the following, a more accurate approximation would be obtained by evaluating the derivative at the midpoint of
the segment. However, since we shall shrink the entire ﬁgure down to the point o, and are dealing with ultimate equality in
this limit, we think the argument may be easier to follow without taking this extra step.

(29.5)
We now see that the Riemann curvature operator introduced in [29.6] is, in fact,
R(u, v) =[∇u , ∇v] −∇[u, v].
(29.6)
The minus sign on the left-hand side of (29.5) is important, so let us make a point of reminding
the reader of its origin and geometrical meaning. The operator on the right-hand side tells us
the net change in the (arbitrary) ﬁducial vector ﬁeld w (relative to w||) as we traverse the loop.
But the geometrically meaningful quantity we seek is the vector holonomy δw||, which is the
opposite: the change in w|| relative to w.
Note that R is antisymmetric:
R(u, v) = −R(v, u)
=⇒
R(u, u) = 0.
(29.7)
The truth of the ﬁrst equation is geometrically clear, for it simply asserts that if we reverse the
direction in which we traverse the parallelogram, the vector holonomy is reversed. Likewise, the
second equation may be viewed as saying that if any vector is parallel-transported back and forth
a short distance along an arbitrary vector u, then it returns unchanged.
Only a minor change of notation is now needed to ﬁnally arrive at the standard deﬁnition of
the famous Riemann curvature tensor R—it is a vector-valued function R(u, v; w) of three input
vectors:9
R(u, v; w) ≡R(u, v) w =
{
[∇u , ∇v] −∇[u, v]
}
w.
(29.8)
CONVENTION WARNING: The arrangement of vectors in the slots of R differs amongst authors. For
example, Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) agree with our deﬁnition of R(u, v) w above, but, on
the left-hand side, their R(u, v; w) rearranges the slots in such a way that their R turns out to be
the negative of ours.
9It is not entirely standard to use a semicolon to separate the parallelogram vectors from the vector that is parallel-transported
around it, but we think it helpful (as does Penrose!).

29.5 The Riemann Curvature Tensor
•
291
29.5.4
Riemann’s Curvature Is a Tensor
As we shall discuss in greater detail in Act V, a tensor is (by deﬁnition) a linear function of its
multiple vector10 inputs. As we now explain, R is indeed multi-linear:
R(u, v; w) is a linear function of each of its three inputs, when the other two are
held ﬁxed.
Furthermore, despite the fact that formula (29.8) is built out of derivatives, the Riemann curvature
only depends on the values of the three vectors at the point at which R is evaluated—it is indepen-
dent of how the vectors vary in the vicinity of that point. At the computational level, this appears
downright paradoxical, and yet it does make geometrical sense, for R is telling us about the curva-
ture of the space itself, and the vectors merely serve to single out particular parts (or components)
of this curvature.
To summarize, here are
The two deﬁning properties of a tensor:
•
The output depends linearly on each input vector.
•
The output only depends on the input vectors at the point of evaluation.
First, let us establish linearity in the w-slot. Suppose that w = k1w1 + k2w2, where k1 and
k2 are constants. If w, w1, and w2 are each parallel-transported (starting at o) around a small
(ultimately vanishing) parallelogram L with edges along u and v, then
δw|| = k1δ[w1]|| + k2δ[w2]||,
so the geometrical interpretation (29.5) implies that
R(u, v; k1w1 + k2w2) = k1 R(u, v; w1) + k2 R(u, v; w2).
Of course this can also be instantly conﬁrmed by computation: just use the formula (29.8) and the
simple fact that the intrinsic derivatives act linearly, e.g.,
∇v[k1w1 + k2w2] = k1∇vw1 + k2∇vw2.
To start to test the second requirement of tensorhood, suppose that we change wOLD in the
vicinity of o into wNEW = f wOLD, where f is an arbitrary (differentiable) function of position,
except that f(o) = 1, so that wNEW(o) = wOLD(o).
At this point, we strongly encourage you to pause in order to actually carry out the somewhat
lengthy (but straightforward) computation that proves that, when evaluated at o,
R(u, v; wNEW) = R(u, v; wOLD).
If you just did this calculation, you saw that four terms arose that involved derivatives of f, but
then, “miraculously,” they all cancelled each other out! (NOTE: This is not cause for celebration—
see the deﬁnition of a “false miracle” in the Prologue!)
10In Act V we will generalize this to the standard deﬁnition, whereby we allow the input of both vectors and 1-forms
(introduced at the start of Act V).

292
•
Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
Fortunately, this can instead be understood directly from the geometrical perspective, because
varying the ﬁducial vector ﬁeld w along L in any manner (not merely scaling it by f) has absolutely
no effect on the geometrically meaningful parallel transport of the initial vector around L, and
hence absolutely no effect on the vector holonomy! Thus R(u, v; w) does indeed only depend on
the value of w at o.
Now let us turn our attention to the ﬁrst two slots, and let us start with the second deﬁning
property of a tensor. In the limit that loop shrinks to o, only the values u(o) and v(o) are needed to
construct the loop around which w is parallel-transported, so the vector holonomy, and therefore
R, only depends on the values of these input vectors at o.
To witness the decisive advantage of the geometrical perspective, but also as a character-
building exercise in the computational use of formula (29.8), let us play the same game with u
that we previously did with w. That is, let us change uOLD in the vicinity of o into uNEW = f uOLD,
where f is an arbitrary function. Now try your hand at proving (directly from the formula) that
R(uNEW, v; w) = R(f uOLD, v; w) = f R(uOLD, v; w).
Thus, if we again insist that f(o) = 1, to ensure that uNEW(o) = uOLD(o), then
R(uNEW, v; w)(o) = R(uOLD, v; w)(o),
as required of a tensor.
Finally, let us turn to the linearity in the ﬁrst two slots. Because of the antisymmetry (29.7),
it sufﬁces to prove linearity in either slot. Here there is essentially no difference between the geo-
metrical and computational perspectives, and we leave the very short calculation to you, which
establishes that,
R(k1u1 + k2u2, v; w) = k1 R(u1, v; w) + k2 R(u2, v; w).
GRAND CONCLUSION: Riemann’s curvature is indeed a tensor!
29.5.5
Components of the Riemann Tensor
In order to give a numerical description of geometrical objects, we introduce a set of orthonormal
basis vectors, {ei}, for the Rn tangent space at each point of the n-manifold. Then, for exam-
ple, a geometrical vector u is represented by its numerical components, {ui}, where u = ∑
i uiei.
WARNING: When dealing with components, we must remember that the superscripts are labels,
not powers!
More complex geometrical objects, such as the Riemann tensor, require multiple distinct
indices to describe their components. This leads to a profusion of summations. But it turns out that
we can always arrange for the index that is being summed over to appear once as a superscript
and once as a subscript.
Einstein therefore introduced a simple, clutter-clearing convention, called the Einstein sum-
mation convention, whereby the sum over such a pair of indices is simply understood, and the
summation sign is omitted. For example,
u =
n
∑
i=1
uiei
⇐⇒
Einstein summation convention:
u = uiei.
To ﬁnd the components of the Riemann tensor, we decompose each of its three vector inputs
into components:
u = uiei,
v = vjej,
and
w = wkek.

29.5 The Riemann Curvature Tensor
•
293
Thus,
R(u, v; w)
=
R(uiei, vjej; wkek)
=
R(ei, ej; ek) ui vj wk
We can now deﬁne Rijkl, the components of the Riemann tensor, as the components of the
vector that results when the Riemann tensor acts on three basis vectors:
R(ei, ej; ek) ≡Rijkl el.
Thus the effect of R on three general vectors can easily be expressed in terms of these components:
R(u, v; w) =
h
Rijkl ui vj wki
el.
For later use, we also deﬁne,
Rijkm ≡R(ei, ej; ek)·em.
(29.9)
In our chosen orthonormal basis, el·em = 0 if l ̸= m, and it equals 1 when l = m, so
Rijkm = R

.

29.5.6
For a Given wo, the Vector Holonomy Only Depends on
the Plane of the Loop and Its Area
Within a 2-surface, the holonomy R(L) ≍K δA of a small loop L only depended on its area, δA,
and was independent of it shape. In an n-manifold, there are now many, independent choices for
the plane of L. Let us therefore deﬁne,
Π(u, v) ≡The plane spanned by u and v.
This choice of Π(u, v) certainly dictates the vector holonomy. However, for a given wo, the
vector holonomy only depends on Π itself, and on the area of the loop:
If we parallel transport wo around a small (ultimately vanishing) parallelogram
in a plane Π, then the vector holonomy is proportional to the area δA of the
parallelogram, and is independent of its shape.
(29.11)
We will prove this by calculation, in order to illustrate the power of our brand-new tool of ten-
sor components. Let e1 and e2 be chosen within the plane of L. Then, using the Einstein summation
convention,
u δu = δu1 e1 + δu2 e2 = δui ei
and
v δv = δv1 e1 + δv2 e2 = δvj ej.

29.5.7
Symmetries of the Riemann Tensor
Naively, one would expect the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor Rijkm
in a 3-manifold, deﬁned in (29.9), to be 34 = 81. And yet we have already stated that the true
number is only six! This dramatic reduction results from the fact that the Riemann tensor possesses
four remarkable algebraic symmetries.
The ﬁrst one we have already met in (29.7): R(u, v; w) is antisymmetric in its ﬁrst two slots,
and this implies that
Rjikm = −Rijkm.
This immediately reduces the number of independent components [exercise] from 81 to 54.
We now prove a second, far less obvious symmetry, namely, that Rijkm is also antisymmetric
in its last two slots:
Rijmk = −Rijkm
(29.13)
This further reduces the number of independent components [exercise] from 54 to 36.
Since parallel transport preserves length, the vector wo returns to o as the slightly rotated vector
w||(o), and therefore the connecting vector δw|| between the tips of these vectors is ultimately
orthogonal to both of them:
δw||· wo = 0
=⇒
[R(u, v) wo]· wo = 0.

29.5 The Riemann Curvature Tensor
•
295
Now let x and y be arbitrary vectors, and set wo = x + y. Then,
0
=
[R(u, v) (x + y)]· (x + y)
=
[R(u, v) x]· x + [R(u, v) x]· y + [R(u, v) y]· x + [R(u, v) y]· y
=
0 + [R(u, v) x]· y + [R(u, v) y]· x + 0.
Therefore,
[R(u, v) x]· y = −[R(u, v) y]· x,
(29.14)
and so (29.13) follows immediately from the deﬁnition (29.9).
For the sake of completeness, we now state the remaining symmetries of the Riemann tensor.
First, the Algebraic Bianchi Identity11 states that if the ﬁrst three vectors are permuted
cyclically, their sum vanishes:
R(u, v) w + R(v, w) u + R(w, u) v = 0
⇐⇒
Rijkm + Rjkim + Rkijm = 0.
(29.15)
Exercise 10 provides both a computational and a geometric proof of this result.
Next, the Riemann tensor is symmetric under interchange of the ﬁrst and second pairs of vectors:
[R(u, v) x]· y = [R(x, y) u]· v
⇐⇒
Rijkm = Rkmij.
(29.16)
Although this is very useful, it is not a truly new symmetry, but rather a consequence of the
previous symmetries. For a computational proof, see Exercise 10.
Using these symmetries, you may conﬁrm [exercise]12 that in a 3-manifold the Riemann ten-
sor has only six independent components. More generally, Exercise 11 shows that in an n-manifold
the number of components is given by 1
12n2(n2 −1), as previously claimed in (29.1).
Finally, in addition to the four algebraic symmetries above, there exists a ﬁfth, differential
symmetry, of fundamental importance to Einstein’s theory of gravity—it is called the Differential
Bianchi Identity:13
∇xR(u, v) w + ∇uR(v, x) w + ∇vR(x, u) w = 0,
(29.17)
in which the ﬁrst three vectors are permuted cyclically, as they were in the Algebraic Bianchi
Identity. The proof of this result will be deferred until we can derive it elegantly, using curvature
2-forms, in Section 38.12.4.
11Also called the First Bianchi Identity or the Bianchi Symmetry, but actually discovered by Ricci!
12Try simply listing six independent components, and then convince yourself that all other components can be found using
the symmetries.
13Also called the Second Bianchi Identity. According to Pais (1982, pp. 275–276), this was ﬁrst discovered by Aurel Voss (1880),
then Ricci (1889), and then Bianchi (1902). However, even Voss was not the ﬁrst—see [29.10]!

29.5.8
Sectional Curvatures
In a 2-surface, the Gaussian curvature K emerged as the holonomy per unit area of a vector that
necessarily resided within the plane of the loop around which it was parallel-transported. But in our
3-manifold (or n-manifold), wo will typically stick out of this plane. Nevertheless, we are certainly
free to choose it to lie within Π(u, v), in the hope of recovering a concept of curvature akin to the
2-dimensional case.
However, at ﬁrst we seem to hit a road block:
Even if we insist that the initial vector wo lie within Π(u, v), then parallel-transporting it around
a loop within Π will not return it to o merely rotated within Π—the returning vector w||(o) will
typically stick out of Π.
To overcome this, let us focus our attention on the orthogonal projection P[w||] of w|| into Π.
More formally, if Π = Π(e1, e2) then this orthogonal projection operator P is given by,
P[a1e1 + a2e2 + a3e3] = a1e1 + a2e2.
We will prove the following:
Let wo be any vector in Π, and let w|| be parallel-transported around a loop in Π.
Deﬁne K(u, v) to be the rotation per unit area of the projection P[w||] of w|| into
Π. Then K(u, v) is independent of the speciﬁc choice of wo.
The curvature K(u, v) = K(Π) therefore depends only on the plane Π, and is called the
sectional curvature of Π(u, v).
To verify this, we simply take the general vector holonomy formula (29.12) and insist that wo
lie in Π(u, v) = Π(e1, e2):
wo = w1
o e1 + w2
o e2,
and for simplicity’s sake let us again assume that it is unit vector. Writing (29.12) in column-vector
form, and using (29.10), we see that P[δw||] is

But the antisymmetry (29.13) yields
R1211 = 0 = R1222
and
R1221 = −R1212.
Therefore, we now formally deﬁne the sectional curvature as
K(Π) ≡K(e1, e2) ≡[R(e1, e2) e2]·e1 = R1221,
(29.18)
which is to say, the holonomy of e2, after parallel-transporting it around the {e1, e2}-loop, projected
onto e1. Then

[29.9] If wo lies within the plane Π of the loop, then

tor returns rotated by δΘ ≍|δP[w||]| ≍K(Π) δA,
where K(Π) is the sectional curvature of Π.
where w⊥is simply wo rotated through a
right angle within Π, as illustrated in [29.9].
Thus, as the ﬁgure explains, the angle δΘ
through which the projection P[w||] has been
rotated by parallel-transport around the loop
of area δA is δΘ ≍K(Π) δA, independent of
wo. We have come full circle to our original
view of curvature as the holonomy per unit
area within a 2-surface:
δΘ
δA ≍K(Π) = R1221.
(29.20)
Only now there are many such sectional cur-
vatures, depending upon which plane Π we
parallel transport within.
As we mentioned earlier, knowing the sectional curvatures in just the orthogonal coordinate
planes, for example, only gives a very incomplete14 picture of the Riemann curvature of the space.
But what if we are allowed to know K(Π) for all possible planes Π?
It turns out that this is sufﬁcient to reconstruct the complete Riemann tensor! It is not easy
to ﬁnd this discussed in standard texts, but Kühnel (2015, p. 247) gives an explicit formula for
[R(u, v) x]·y in terms of a sum of eighteen sectional curvatures of eighteen planes constructed
from linear combinations of the four input vectors of the Riemann curvature!
29.5.9
Historical Notes on the Origin of the Riemann Tensor
Riemann announced the discovery of his tensor, albeit obliquely, on the 10th of June, 1854, in a
lecture at Göttingen University—as a mandatory part of his application to become an unsalaried
faculty member!—delivered to a mainly non-mathematical audience.
The lecture made oracular pronouncements (without providing a shred of evidence) and it
contained only a single formula: the metric for an n-manifold of constant curvature. But there was
certainly one mathematician in the audience who grasped his meaning, the one who had forced
Riemann to undertake this investigation in the ﬁrst place: Carl Friedrich Gauss!
As was required by the rules, Riemann had submitted three possible topics for the mandatory
lecture, the ﬁrst of which was his recently completed, ground-breaking doctoral work on what are
now called Riemann surfaces. Convention required that Gauss choose this one, which Riemann
was well-prepared to address. Gauss did not! Instead, he picked Riemann’s third choice: “The
Foundations of Geometry.”
Riemann was thereby forced into a brand new, major investigation, coming right on the heels
of his doctoral masterpiece. The strain of this work, perhaps exacerbated by living in poverty, led
14In the ﬁnal section of this chapter we shall see that (surprisingly!) the mere sum of these sectional curvatures nevertheless
contains critical geometrical information!

298
•
Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
Riemann to suffer another of his recurring mental breakdowns. But he recovered, and, following
seven more weeks of intense effort, he was ready to deliver his June 10th lecture.
Whether Gauss knew of or cared about Riemann’s plight in the run-up to the lecture is not
known; what is known is how Gauss reacted to Riemann’s lecture. Dedekind later recalled that
Gauss sat at the lecture “which surpassed all his expectations, in the greatest astonishment, and on
the way back from the faculty meeting he spoke to Wilhelm Weber, with the greatest appreciation,
and with an excitement rare for him, about the depth of the ideas presented by Riemann.”
In 1861 Riemann submitted a Prize Essay to the French Academy of Sciences that included a
more mathematically explicit account of the Riemann tensor. But the essay—which did not win
the prize!—concerned heat conduction, and Riemann gave only the briefest of hints regarding its
signiﬁcance to geometry.
Neither this essay nor the original 1854 lecture were published until after Riemann’s death
in 1866 (at the age of 39, from tuberculosis). Felix Klein (1928) summed up the reaction to their
eventual publication in 1868: “I still have vivid memories of the extraordinary impression that
Riemann’s trains of thought made on young mathematicians. Much of it seemed obscure and
hard to understand and yet of unfathomable depth.”
Now we come face to face with the same mystery that opened Act IV, there regarding Ein-
stein, but now regarding Riemann: Levi-Civita discovered parallel transport fully 63 years after
Riemann’s lecture, so the modern geometrical interpretation of the Riemann tensor that we have
provided would have been out of reach for Riemann himself. So how did Riemann discover his
tensor?
The answer is that nobody knows! Spivak (1999) provides an English translation of the 1854
lecture, along with explanatory notes in which Spivak speculates on how Riemann might have
done it. Spivak also includes an analysis of Riemann’s Prize Essay of 1861.
What is clear from Riemann’s own words is that his initial interpretation of his tensor was
that it measures the deviation of the n-manifold’s metric from the Euclidean metric. More precisely, Rie-
mann discovered the following remarkably direct link between his tensor and the metric. If ds is
the distance between the point p with Cartesian coordinates xi and the neighbouring point with
coordinates (xi + dxi), then the difference between the actual metric and the Euclidean metric is
given by this remarkable formula:
ds2 −[dx2
1 + · · · + dx2
n] ≍1
12
∑
i,j,k,m
Rijkm(p) (xi dxj −xj dxi) (xk dxm −xm dxk).
For more on this, see Spivak (1999) and Berger (2003, §4.4).
The Mystery of Riemann’s Curvature (Darrigol 2015) is a fascinating and thought-provoking
investigation of these questions. Darrigol’s analysis is based, in part, on photographs of previ-
ously unpublished, private notes by Riemann, which had been sitting in the archives of Göttingen
University for more than 150 years.
One such scrap of paper is shown in [29.10]. Darrigol’s painstaking decoding of Riemann’s
notation allows him to enter a fascinating correction into the annals of the history of mathemat-
ics. For that long, unintelligible ﬁnal line turns out to be none other than the Differential Bianchi
Identity, (29.17), which would be rediscovered decades later—ﬁrst15 by Aurel Voss (1880), then
Ricci (1889), and then Bianchi (1902)—becoming one of the cornerstones16 of Einstein’s General
Relativity!

The Jacobi Equation in an n-Manifold
29.6.1
Geometrical Proof of the Sectional Jacobi Equation
Within a 2-surface, the Jacobi Equation (the Equation of Geodesic Deviation) (28.2) describes the
attraction (or repulsion) of neighbouring geodesics that pass through a region of positive (or
negative) curvature, respectively.
In a 2-surface, this attraction or repulsion only depends on the curvature of the surface at the
point through which the geodesics pass: it does not depend on the direction in which the geodesics
pass through the point.
Within a 3-manifold, the attraction or repulsion again only depends on the (instantaneous)
plane within which the neighbouring geodesics are travelling, not the direction of the geodesics
within that plane. This plane Π = Π(v, ξ) is spanned by the velocity vector v and the connecting
vector ξ. But whereas there was only one possible “choice” for the plane for a 2-surface, now there
inﬁnitely many such planes within our 3-manifold (or n-manifold), and, as already illustrated
in [29.2], the sectional curvature in these planes can be positive in one and negative in another,
causing attraction in one, and repulsion in the other.
It is therefore natural to guess that the generalization of the Jacobi Equation (28.2) to an
n-manifold simply replaces the Gaussian curvature K with the sectional curvature K(Π) of the
instantaneous plane within which the two neighbouring geodesics are travelling, and we shall
now give two proofs that this is correct, but with a twist: we must focus on the component of the
relative acceleration that lies within Π.
Whereas before we used a Newtonian superscript dot to denote the derivative along the
geodesics, we now use the more standard ∇v. Therefore, the relative velocity is now written
∇v ξ, and the relative acceleration, ∇v∇v ξ.
Reconsider our original proof of the Jacobi Equation in [28.7], but now imagine that the rect-
angle around which we parallel-transport the velocity lies within an arbitrary plane Π in our
3-manifold (or n-manifold). As before, parallel-transporting v|| around the loop with orthogonal

δv|| ≍δt ∇v∇v ξ.
Since the speed of the particles is constant, δv|| is orthogonal to v. In the 2-surface [28.7],
this implied that it pointed along ±ξ, but in a 3-manifold this is no longer true: it can also have
a component17 orthogonal to Π. In summary, the relative acceleration ∇v∇v ξ has a component

within Π that is responsible for pulling the geodesics together (or pushing them apart), and a
component orthogonal to Π that does not affect the separation of the geodesics, but that causes
them to rotate about one another.
We now focus attention on the attraction/repulsion component within Π, namely P[∇v∇v ξ].
As we have seen in (29.20), if we project the parallel-transported vector into Π then the holonomy is
once again given by the curvature times the area of the rectangle, only now it is the sectional
curvature, K(Π).
Thus, our original argument in [28.7] goes through essentially unchanged, except that now
(29.19) only applies to the projection of ∇v∇v ξ into Π, yielding,

and so we obtain what we shall christen18 the
Sectional Jacobi Equation:
P [∇v∇v ξ] = −K(Π) ξ.
(29.21)
NOTE: This is not the standard “Jacobi Equation,” which will be derived shortly (see (29.24)).
29.6.2
Geometrical Implications of the Sectional Jacobi Equation
To gain an intuitive grasp of the import of this equation, consider [29.11]. A set of particles are
arranged around the perimeter of a small circle in a plane. A ﬁducial particle is added at the
centre of the circle, the vector ξ connecting this central particle to a typical particle on the circle.
Now simultaneously ﬁre these particles perpendicularly to the plane, with velocity v. Ini-
tially, the particles will move in rigid unison, maintaining the same-size circular pattern. But then
the curvature of the space begins to make itself felt, via the Sectional Jacobi Equation, (29.21).
The motion of each individual particle on the circle, relative to the central one, is now governed
by the particular K(Π) for the particular plane Π(v, ξ) for that particular particle’s ξ.
Thus as we move from a 2-surface to a 3-manifold (or n-manifold), a fundamentally new feature
emerges: as the plane Π(v, ξ) rotates about the central axis (consisting of the central particle’s
trajectory) the sectional curvature K(Π) varies, both in magnitude and (possibly) sign.
Figure [29.11a] illustrates the case in which all sectional curvatures K(v, ξ) are negative,
regardless of the direction of ξ, causing the particles to be repelled, accelerating apart on an
expanding circle.19 To use an optical analogy, negative curvature acts like a diverging lens.
Next, [29.11b] illustrates the case in which all curvatures are positive. In addition to the
focusing attraction, governed by (29.21), here we have illustrated a case in which the relative
acceleration has an appreciable component orthogonal to Π, causing the bundle of geodesics to
rotate about the central one. This effect is intentionally ignored in our Sectional Jacobi Equation,
(29.21), but it is taken into account by the (upcoming) full Jacobi Equation, (29.24). This is akin to
the positive focussing of light by a magnifying lens.
Finally, [29.11c] depicts the most interesting case, and, as we shall see in the next chapter,
the one of greatest importance to gravitational physics. Here the sectional curvature is positive in
some planes (squeezing the circle of particles together) and negative in others (pulling the circle
apart). The originally circular array of particles is therefore deformed into an ellipse, with minor
18Despite its twin virtues—(1) of providing a very direct interpretation of the sectional curvature, and (2) of being formally
identical to the full Jacobi equation (28.2) in a 2-surface—we have not found this result written down in any standard text. We
therefore felt the need to invent a logical name for this formula.
19If the negative curvatures were to vary in magnitude, then the circle would become oval as it grew.

[29.11] A small circle of particles are ﬁred perpendicularly to the circle. Some planes Π(v, ξ) may have

in repulsion from the central particle. [a] K(Π) < 0 in all planes. [b] K(Π) > 0 in all planes. [c] Attraction in

astigmatic lens.
In the next chapter we shall see that the optical analogy is not an analogy at all—it is reality!
That is, the gravitational curvature of spacetime really does act like a lens as light passes through it!
29.6.3
Computational Proofs of the Jacobi Equation
and the Sectional Jacobi Equation
For our orthonormal basis for Π, let us take e1 = bξ = ξ/|ξ| and e2 = v. Then e3 ≡e1×e2 will be the
unit normal to Π. The deﬁnition (29.18) of the sectional curvature can now be written,
K(Π) = R1221 = [R(e1, e2) e2]·e1 = [R(bξ, v) v)]·bξ.
(29.22)
By deﬁnition, ξ always connects the two neighbouring geodesics, so the parallelogram with
edges v and ξ closes up:
[v, ξ] = 0
⇐⇒
∇vξ = ∇ξv.
(29.23)
Note (for use in just a moment) that this implies that the Riemann curvature operator (29.6)
simpliﬁes to
R(v, ξ) =[∇v , ∇ξ].
Taking the intrinsic derivative (∇v) of (29.23) along the geodesics, and recalling that v satisﬁes
the geodesic equation, ∇vv = 0, we ﬁnd that
∇v∇v ξ
=
∇v∇ξ v
= [∇v , ∇ξ] v + ∇ξ(∇vv)
=
R(v, ξ) v + ∇ξ (0).

Chapter 29 Riemann’s Curvature
Thus we have obtained the Equation of Geodesic Deviation, or the
Jacobi Equation:
∇v∇v ξ = −R(ξ, v) v.
(29.24)
This is the standard form of the Jacobi equation, which is found in all texts.
To instead recover our more intuitive “sectional” form, we decompose the vector on the right-
hand side of the equation into its components, and ﬁnd,
R(ξ, v) v
=
{
[R(ξ, v) v]·bξ

by virtue of (29.22).
The second term, R1223|ξ|e3, is the component of the relative acceleration orthogonal to Π,
which is responsible for the rotation of the bundle of geodesics, as illustrated in [29.11b].
The ﬁrst term represents the attraction or repulsion within Π. Indeed, applying the projection
operator P to both sides of the Jacobi Equation, (29.24), we recover the Sectional Jacobi Equation,
(29.21):
P [∇v∇v ξ] = −P [R(ξ, v) v] = −K(Π) ξ.
29.7
The Ricci Tensor
29.7.1
Acceleration of the Area Enclosed by a Bundle of Geodesics
Reconsider [29.11b]. The shaded area δA of the disc (inside the circle of particles) clearly shrinks as
the particles are pulled together by the positive sectional curvatures. But according to what law?
For simplicity’s sake, let us initially suppose that as Π rotates about the central particle’s
trajectory, all the sectional curvatures have the same positive value K. Now let r(t) = |ξ(t)|, so that
δA(t) = π[r(t)]2 is the area at time t after launch. Reverting to Newtonian dots for time derivatives,
it is clear that the initial rate of change of the area vanishes, because the particles head off in rigid
unison, so that.r(0) = 0, and therefore.
(δA)(0) = 2πr(0).r(0) = 0.
The sectional Jacobi Equation (29.21) tells us that the acceleration of the particles towards the
centre is ..r (0) = −Kr(0). Therefore the curvature manifests itself in the initial acceleration of the
area:
..
(δA)(0) = 2π [.r
2(0) + r(0)..r (0)] = −2π K[r(0)]2 = −2K δA(0).
Therefore, for small t, the Maclaurin expansion shows that the area decreases in proportion
to the curvature and as the square of the time:
change in the area after time t = δA(t) −δA(0) ≍−K δA(0)t2.
Of course if K were negative, as in [29.11a], then the right-hand side would be positive,
corresponding accelerating growth of the area.

[29.12] Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (1853–1925), who
later in life became known simply as Gregorio Ricci
(pronounced “reechee”).
Now that we have a rough idea of
what is happening, let us move on to the
general case, in which K(Π) varies in mag-
nitude (and possibly sign) as Π rotates
about the central axis.
Let θ denote the angle around this
axis, starting from an arbitrary initial ξ-
direction. Consider the narrow (ultimately
vanishing) sector of the disc located at
angle θ and of angular width δθ. The anal-
ysis above still applies to this sector, pro-
vided we replace K with the sectional cur-
vature K(θ) of the particular plane Π(θ) in
this direction.
It follows that, in the general case, the
previous equation becomes
δA(t) −δA(0) ≍−Kmean δA(0)t2,
where
Kmean ≡1

K(θ) dθ.
(29.25)
Here, Kmean is the average (or “mean”) of
the sectional curvatures in all the planes
containing the central particle’s trajectory,
in the direction v.

Next, we shall ﬁnd a formula for K(θ) in terms
of the Riemann tensor. To do so, let us choose e3 = v to
be the direction of the central axis, in the direction that
the particles are launched. See [29.13]. Then e1 and e2
are orthogonal unit vectors in the plane of the circle of
particles. Having chosen the direction of e1 arbitrarily,
let us agree to measure θ from this direction, as shown.
The plane Π(θ) is then spanned by v and the unit
vector bξ(θ) in the direction of the particle at angle θ:
bξ(θ) = cos θ e1 + sin θ e2 ≡c e1 + s e2,
for short. Then the sectional curvature of Π(θ) is given
by (29.22):
K(θ)
=
[R(bξ, v; v)]·bξ
=
[R(c e1 + s e2, v; v)]·(c e1 + s e2)
=
[c R(e1, v; v) + s R(e2, v; v)]·(c e1 + s e2)
=
c2 R(e1, v; v)·e1 + s2 R(e2, v; v)·e2 + sc [R(e1, v; v)·e2 + R(e2, v; v)·e1]
=
c2 K(0) + s2 K( π
2 ) + 2scR1332,
where the last term follows from the symmetry [exercise], R2331 = R1332.

.
(29.26)
Recall that the direction θ = 0 was chosen arbitrarily, so we have proved the remarkable fact that
the average of the sectional curvatures over all directions is obtained by averaging it in any two
orthogonal directions.
Combining (29.25) with (29.26), we may sum up our ﬁndings as follows:
If a small circle of particles are ﬁred with velocity v perpendicularly to the circle,
the acceleration of the area δA of the circle is controlled by the average of the sec-
tional curvatures in all planes containing v, but this is given by the sum of the
sectional curvatures in any two orthogonal planes containing v:
..
(δA)(0) = −[K(0) + K( π
2 )] δA(0),
and so
δA(t) −δA(0) ≍−1
2 [K(0) + K( π
2 )] δA(0)t2
(29.27)
29.7.2
Deﬁnition and Geometrical Meaning of the Ricci Tensor
Let us focus our attention on this sum of sectional curvatures in orthogonal coordinate planes
containing the velocity v = e3 of the particles. Recalling that R3333 = 0, by antisymmetry, we may
write this as
K(0) + K( π
2 )
=
R(e1, e3; e3)·e1 + R(e2, e3; e3)·e2
=
R1331 + R2332 + R3333

m33
.
In a moment, this expression will guide us to the introduction of a brand new tensor, the Ricci
curvature tensor. Whereas the Riemann tensor takes three vectors as input, and outputs a vector,
the new Ricci tensor takes two vectors as input, and outputs a scalar.
NOTE ON NOTATION: It is an unfortunate accident of history that both the names Riemann and
Ricci begin with the letter “R”! This has resulted in the universally accepted notation whereby the
components of the Ricci tensor are denoted Rjk. We dare not defy this tradition—and do not even
wish to!—but please be on high alert that an R with four indices is a component of the Riemann
tensor, while an R with two indices is a component of the Ricci tensor. That said, it would be simply
too confusing to represent these two (very different) geometrical tensors with the same symbol, R!

29.7 The Ricci Tensor
•
305
Therefore, we shall adopt (essentially20) the notation employed by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
(1973), reserving R for the Riemann tensor, and writing the geometrical Ricci tensor itself as Ricci.
The deﬁnition of the Ricci curvature tensor is this:
Ricci(v, w) ≡
n
∑
m=1
R(em, v; w)·em
⇐⇒
Rjk = Ricci(ej, ek) = R
m
mjk
.
CONVENTION WARNING: Many authors instead deﬁne Rjk ≡Rjmkm = −Rmjkm, i.e., the negative
of ours. Notably, this is true of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973). However, as we noted earlier,
their deﬁnition of R is also the opposite of ours, and therefore the two sign-convention disagree-
ments cancel: the sign of their Ricci is the same as our Ricci! As we shall see in a moment, positive
Ricci curvature corresponds to attraction (both for us and for Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler). On
the other hand, to cite just one other important example, Penrose (2005) shares our deﬁnition of
R but uses the opposite deﬁnition of Ricci, so for Penrose it is negative Ricci curvature that causes
attraction.
The fact that Ricci is indeed a tensor in its own right follows immediately [exercise] from the
the fact that R is a tensor. It also follows from the symmetries of R that Ricci is symmetric:
Ricci(w, v) = Ricci(v, w)
⇐⇒
Rkj = Rjk.
(29.28)
To see this, swap the ﬁrst pair of vectors in its Riemann-tensor deﬁnition with the second pair, then
swap the vectors within each pair.
We can now see that
K(0) + K( π
2 ) = Rm33m = Ricci(v, v) = Rjkvjvk.
We have therefore arrived at the beautifully simple, Jacobi-type equation that governs the
acceleration of the area of the bundle of geodesics launched with velocity v:
..
δA = −Ricci(v, v) δA.
The role of the Gaussian curvature in the Jacobi equation of a 2-surface (or sectional curvature in
an n-manifold) is here taken over by the Ricci curvature. We stress that positive Ricci curvature
causes attraction, resulting in shrinking area as the geodesics converge.
Now imagine the generalization of the foregoing analysis to a 4-manifold. Again let v be
the velocity with which we will launch a group of particles. This group is again chosen to be
equidistant from the central particle, and located in the space orthogonal to v. But instead of
yielding a circle in a plane, this construction now yields a small sphere of particles, enclosing a
volume δV, in the 3-dimensional space orthogonal to v!
Although we shall not work out the details, the foregoing analysis goes through unchanged,
and, speciﬁcally, the Ricci curvature now dictates the acceleration of the volume of the small sphere
of particles that are simultaneously launched with velocity v:
20Verily, in the Bible it is written, Ricci (in all bold, and italics). By instead only putting the “R” in (nonitalic) bold, we hope to
mentally connect Ricci to its components, Rjk.

..
δV = −Ricci(v, v) δV.

We stress for future use that positive Ricci curvature causes attraction, resulting in shrinking volume
as the geodesics converge.
As before, this implies that (initially) the volume changes in proportion to the Ricci curvature, and
as the square of the time:
δV(t) −δV(0) ≍−1
2 Ricci(v, v) δV(0)t2

Coda
This chapter has introduced a wealth of new ideas and results, but one formula is conspicuous
by its absence: an analogue of (27.1) for expressing the Riemann curvature of an n-manifold in
terms of its metric. The principal reason for this omission was a disciplined focus on providing
the minimal set of concepts and results that will be needed to understand Einstein’s theory of
gravity. A second reason, however, is that the formula for R in terms of the metric coefﬁcients
turns out to be extremely complicated, at least when expressed in standard tensor formalism. In
Act V, we shall see how the calculation of R can be greatly simpliﬁed—at both the theoretical level
and the pragmatic, computational level—by the use of Forms.
As you began this chapter, you may have been preemptively ﬂummoxed by the very notion
that space could be curved—and who could blame you! But we very much hope that the multiple
geometrical interpretations we have provided (especially via the Sectional Jacobi Equation and
the Ricci tensor) have not only put you at your ease regarding Riemann’s curvature within a 3-
manifold, but have actually given you a very concrete, tangible grasp of exactly what this curvature
does.
But 3-manifolds were merely the warm-up act. For it is a psychological illusion that you
are sitting in a 3-dimensional room. In reality, you and your room are hurtling into the future,
within Einstein’s 4-dimensional spacetime. It is to the curvature of that manifold—what we call
“reality”—that we now turn.
Study formula (29.29) well, for we shall see that it is the key to the Universe!

Chapter 30
Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
30.1
Introduction: “The Happiest Thought of My Life.”
This chapter lowers the curtain on Act IV—it is the end of our self-contained introduction to (Visual)
Differential Geometry. We mark this milestone by returning to the subject that began Act IV:
Einstein’s extraordinarily beautiful General Theory of Relativity, which declares that gravity is the
curvature of the 4-dimensional spacetime that comprises the framework of what we call “reality.”
The great American physicist John Archibald Wheeler (1911–2008) famously distilled the the-
ory down to a single sentence: “Space tells matter how to move and matter tells space how to curve.”
In greater detail, free-falling matter moves along the geodesics of the curved spacetime: these are
still the straightest paths, but they now maximize (instead of minimize) the “distance” as mea-
sured by the spacetime metric. The second half of Wheeler’s aphorism is the grand ﬁnale of
Act IV: the precise law that Einstein discovered in 1915 that describes how matter and energy
curve spacetime—the Gravitational Field Equation of General Relativity.
We begin at the historical beginning, with the (probably oversimpliﬁed1) tale of Newton’s
discovery of the inverse-square law of gravity, which would have us picture him sitting in his
garden, in 1666, watching an apple fall from a tree. Suddenly, so the story goes, Newton realized
that the same force that had pulled the apple to Earth might reach out to the Moon, pulling it
towards the Earth, holding it in its orbit.
The genesis story of Einstein’s geometrical theory of gravity is remarkably similar, but
Einstein’s falling object was not an apple, it was a man!
In 1907, fully two years after his discovery of Special Relativity, Einstein still held no academic
position. He had spent the previous ﬁve years as a patent clerk (third class, promoted to second
class) at the Federal Ofﬁce for Intellectual Property, Bern, Switzerland.
As we noted at the outset of Act IV, Einstein knew that despite the superb accuracy of New-
ton’s gravitational law, its instantaneous action-at-a-distance was fundamentally incompatible
with the ﬁnite speed of light, and hence with his 1905 discovery of Special Relativity. Thus began
Einstein’s long struggle to understand gravitation, which would end almost exactly eight years
later, on the 25th of November, 1915, when he ﬁnally wrote down the Gravitational Field Equation.
Einstein took the ﬁrst, crucial step of that long journey in November of 1907, when he had
what he later described as “the happiest thought of my life”:2
I was sitting in a chair in the patent ofﬁce at Bern when all of a sudden a thought occurred
to me: If a person falls freely he will not feel his own weight . . . I was startled. This simple
thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me towards a theory of gravitation.
When we watch astronauts on TV, ﬂoating about within their orbiting space station, it appears
that gravity has been totally eliminated—this is precisely the import of Einstein’s insight. This
seemingly total elimination of gravity arises from the fact that the astronauts and their spacecraft are
1Newton himself did, however, tell this story as related here to four different people on four different occasions. See Westfall
(1980, pp. 154–155).

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
falling freely together in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld—it does not arise from the spacecraft being so
far from Earth that it has escaped the force of gravity!
Yes, Newton’s inverse-square law tells us that gravity is weaker up there than down here,
but a quick calculation shows that the strength of the Newtonian gravitational ﬁeld pulling on the
International Space Station (orbiting at an altitude of 250 miles) is only about 12% weaker than it
is for us down here. No, the seemingly complete elimination of gravity has nothing to do with this
modest effect.
Instead, the total elimination of gravity is the result of the remarkable empirical fact—ﬁrst
discovered by Galileo around 1590, by (supposedly) dropping objects from the Leaning Tower of
Pisa—that all objects are accelerated equally by gravity, regardless of their mass or composition.3 Thus the
astronauts and their spacecraft all follow the same, free-falling orbit together.
This empirical fact is simultaneously enshrined in and explained by Newton’s Law of Grav-
itation. If a particle of very small mass m lies at distance r from a particle with a very large mass
M, then the gravitational effect of m on M can be neglected, and we may think of m as simply
being pulled towards M (with force F) by the latter’s gravitational ﬁeld. Then the acceleration a
of m towards M is given by Newton’s Second Law of Motion:
F = ma.
But if r is the distance of m from M, then Newton’s Inverse-Square Law of Gravitation states that
F = GmM
r2
,
where G is the gravitational constant. Combining these facts,
m..r = −GmM
r2
=⇒
..r = −GM
r2 ,
(30.1)
which is independent of m.
So Newton’s gravitational law explains Galileo’s otherwise deeply mysterious empirical fact
that all objects (launched from the same place in the same manner) follow the same trajectory,
regardless of their composition.
But is it possible to go even deeper? Can we in turn explain this aspect of Newton’s grav-
itational law? Einstein’s geometrical theory does exactly that! If a particle is destined to travel
along the geometrically determined geodesics of spacetime—which have nothing whatsoever to do
with the particle!—this explains Galileo’s empirical fact, and likewise provides the reason that the
gravitational force F must be proportional to the mass, m!
30.2
Gravitational Tidal Forces
But what exactly remains of gravity if it seemingly vanishes for the astronauts within their
spacecraft, all free-falling together? Surely it must leave some trace of its existence?! This is the
fundamentally new question to which we are led by Einstein’s startling insight.
3This is only true if air resistance can be ignored. There is a wonderful ﬁlm (from the 1971 Apollo 15 mission) of astronaut
David Scott simultaneously dropping a feather and a hammer while standing on the surface of the Moon—they both hit the
lunar surface at the same time!

30.2 Gravitational Tidal Forces
•
309
Earth
Horizontal
Attraction/Compression
Vertical
Repulsion/Stretching
Vertical
Repulsion/Stretching
[30.1] The gravitational tidal forces of the Earth act on a free-falling sphere of particles, resulting in compression
in the horizontal “equatorial” plane, parallel to the Earth’s surface, and stretching in the vertical direction of the
gravitational ﬁeld itself. As the sphere falls, it therefore starts to deform into an ellipsoidal egg. For the inverse-
square law, the vertical stretching turns out to be exactly twice as powerful as the equatorial compression.
Well, imagine that you yourself are that astronaut, high above the Earth, but rather than being
safely in orbit inside the space station, you are outside, in your spacesuit, using your jetpack to
hover at a ﬁxed location. Further imagine that you are oriented straight up and down, with your
head furthest from Earth, and your feet closest to it. Surrounding you, evenly spread over the
surface of a sphere centred on you, are hundreds of shiny ball bearings, momentarily at rest, like
you. See [30.1].
Now you turn off your jetpack. You and the sphere of ball bearings surrounding you begin
to free-fall together, from rest, all accelerating downward towards the Earth. What changes, if any,
will you observe in the sphere of particles as you fall?
If the gravitational ﬁeld were perfectly uniform, with constant magnitude and ﬁxed direction,
your answer would be, “I see no changes at all!” Gravity would be truly invisible to you. And
since the actual gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth is approximately uniform over the small sphere, you
won’t see any changes, either . . . at least not at ﬁrst.
However, slowly, you will start to notice that the parts of the sphere above your head and
below your feet are accelerating away from you, while the “equatorial” particles are accelerating
towards to you. The net result is that the sphere starts turning into an egg!
To understand why this is happening, see [30.1], and let us immediately clarify that this dia-
gram shows the forces that are going to drive the deformation of the sphere into the egg, not the
egg itself, which is the new shape of the sphere after it has fallen down towards the Earth for a
period of time.
First, realize that the equatorial particles, at the same altitude as you, are not accelerating in
precisely the same direction that you are. Yes, you and the particles are accelerating downward,
and at the same rate, but you are all accelerating towards the centre of the Earth,4 and therefore your
4In reality, you are being pulled towards every little part of the Earth, with a force that is inversely proportional to the square
of the distance of that particular part from you. But it turns out that the net effect of this horrendously complex sum of forces
is precisely as though all the mass of the Earth were concentrated at its centre! Newton himself was shocked to discover this
genuinely miraculous property of his inverse-square law, and he provided an elegant geometrical proof of it in the Principia
(Newton 1687, Theorem 31). Note that this is another signature of the inverse-square law—it is not shared by other force laws.

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
trajectories are slowly converging. Since you only see the relative acceleration, the equatorial particles
appear to be accelerating directly towards you, as if attracted to you, as illustrated in [30.1].
Now look up at the particles above your head at the top of the sphere, and below your feet
at the bottom of the sphere. Unlike the previous case, you and the particles are now all heading
in the same direction, straight down towards the centre of the Earth. However, the acceleration
of the particles below your feet is greater than your acceleration, because they are closer to the
centre of attraction than you are. Thus you see them start to accelerate away from you downward
towards the Earth. Likewise, the acceleration of the particles above your head is smaller than your
acceleration, because they are further away from the centre of attraction, so you are accelerating
downward faster than they are, so they too seem to accelerate away from you, upward. Thus these
particles appear to be repelled from you, as illustrated in [30.1].
This phenomenon, of compression in one plane and stretching in the orthogonal direction,
deforming a sphere into an egg, is called the gravitational tidal force. It is the answer to our
Einstein-inspired question, “What remains of gravity in free-fall?”
Let us connect these observations more directly to our original astronauts in orbit around
the Earth. Instead of falling from rest, suppose that you and your sphere of particles all blast off
together with an arbitrary but shared velocity; the egg-inducing forces will be exactly the same as
before! In particular, suppose this velocity is chosen to point horizontally, parallel to the Earth’s
surface, and suppose the launch speed is chosen so as to set you and your sphere into a circular
orbit around the Earth. Finally, imagine that you and your sphere are inside the orbiting space
station, and the ball bearings are replaced with fellow astronauts! If you look very closely, we will
see that gravity has not been completely eliminated: a vertically (i.e., radially) separated astronaut
will gradually accelerate away from you, while a horizontally separated astronaut will gradually
accelerate towards you. However, as we shall see in the next section, these tidal forces are propor-
tional to the separation of the particles, and over the small distances within the space station they
are undetectable. But over larger scales, the impact of these tidal forces becomes obvious, which
brings us to our next topic. . . .
Why is this gravitational distortion force ﬁeld called “tidal”? What is the connection between
this phenomenon and the tides of our oceans?
Imagine in [30.1] that the Earth is instead the Sun, and our small sphere is instead the Earth,
or rather the thin skin of the Earth—its oceans. The tidal force of the Sun on the Earth now causes
a bulging of the oceans towards the Sun on the side of the Earth facing the Sun, and a bulging of
the oceans away from the Sun on the opposite side, representing a rise in sea level in these two
opposite directions. This is the ﬁxed, dotted ellipsoidal egg shown in all four panels of [30.2].
The directions of the bulges remain ﬁxed as the Earth rotates once every 24 hours, so each
coastal area encounters one of these bulges every 12 hours—these are the high tides! Well, as illus-
trated in [30.2], it’s actually much more complicated than that, because the Moon exerts exactly
the same kind of gravitational distortion on our oceans, and, despite its minuscule mass compared
to the Sun, its proximity to Earth induces tidal forces that are roughly twice5 as great as the Sun’s!
The actual tides are the complex6 result of the superposition of these twin tidal forces of the Sun
and Moon; their interaction over one lunar orbit is illustrated and explained by [30.2]. This was
ﬁrst understood by Newton, and was another triumph of the Principia (Newton, 1687).
The geometry is simplest when we see a full moon (top left of [30.2]), or a new moon (bottom
left of [30.2]), for this means that the Moon, Earth, and Sun are lined up, in which case the tidal
bulges induced by the Moon and Sun on Earth’s oceans are lined up, too, reinforcing each other,
producing the greatest high tides, and also the lowest low tides; these are called Spring tides.
(NOTE: These operate year-round, and have nothing to do with the season we call “Spring.”)

[30.2] Explanation of the Ocean Tides. The tidal forces of the Moon (dashed line) and of the Sun (dotted oval)
combine to distort the oceans (shaded oval areas), creating the tides. (NOTE: Nothing is to scale! The oceans and
the tides are massively exaggerated, and the distance to the Moon is massively shrunken!) Top left, the illuminated
half of the Moon faces the Earth, the reﬂected sunlight being seen by us as a Full Moon. Since the tidal forces of
the Sun and Moon are now aligned, they reinforce each other to produce the greatest high tides, and the lowest
low tides; these are the Spring tides. Top right, the more powerful lunar tidal forces are partially cancelled out
by the orthogonal solar tidal forces, resulting in the smallest difference between high and low tides; these are the
Neap tides.
When the Moon and Sun form a right angle at the Earth (top right and bottom right of [30.2]),
they produce bulges in orthogonal directions, so the smaller solar bulge partially cancels out the
larger lunar bulge, resulting in the smallest difference between high and low tide; these are called
Neap tides.
Since—by deﬁnition!—the Moon executes one orbit of Earth each month, it is lined up with
the Earth and the Sun twice per month: the New Moon corresponds to the Moon lying between the
Sun and the Earth, while the Full Moon corresponds to the Earth lying between the Sun and the
Moon. Thus the Spring tides occur every two weeks, and the same is true of the Neap tides,
the alternation between the two being weekly—the time it takes for the Moon to execute one-
quarter of an orbit around the Earth, as shown in [30.2].

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
To learn much more about the physics of gravity (and the tides in particular) we strongly
recommend Gravity From The Ground Up (Schutz 2003).
30.3
Newton’s Gravitational Law in Geometrical Form
(NOTE: The following exposition of Einstein’s geometrical theory of gravity is inspired by Pen-
rose’s beautiful essay, The Geometry of the Universe (Penrose 1978) and also by the three relevant
chapters of his remarkable work, The Road to Reality (Penrose 2005, §§17–19). However, we shall
explicitly prove several crucial results that Penrose states but leaves as exercises for the reader, and
we shall also include some additional geometrical observations that Penrose does not mention.)
The tidal forces we have just described would be qualitatively the same for any conceivable
gravitational law of attraction that decreased with distance. But the actual law of gravitation, dis-
covered by Newton and published in his Principia of 1687, decreases as the square of the distance. As
we will now show, this law, and this law alone, results in tidal forces that have a very speciﬁc and
very beautiful geometrical signature.
Let r be your distance from the centre of the Earth, let ξ be the radius of the horizontal,
“equatorial” circle of the sphere of particles that surround you, and let δφ be the small angle
subtended by ξ at the centre of the Earth. Then ξ ≍r δφ. Since δφ remains ﬁxed as you and the
equatorial particles fall radially towards the centre of the Earth, the inward acceleration of this
circle towards you is given by
..
ξ ≍..r δφ = −GM
r2
δφ = −GM
r3
r δφ ≍−GM
r3
ξ,
by virtue of (30.1).
If the previous two chapters have done their job, your immediate, Pavlovian reaction to the
mere sight7 of this formula is to exclaim, “That’s a Jacobi equation!” We shall make the connection
explicit before long, but this attraction of horizontally separated particles is indeed due to positive
sectional curvature, K+, where
..
ξ = −K+ξ
=⇒
K+ = +GM
r3 .
(30.2)
Let Ξ denote the distance from you to the particles above your head and below your feet—
we chose a Greek letter that depicts this! As illustrated in [30.1], and as previously discussed,
the relative acceleration of these particles away from you is given by the difference δ..r in the
acceleration..r —given by (30.1)—at your height r and at height r + δr = r + Ξ. Thus,
..
Ξ = δ..r ≍[Br..r ] δr = Br
[

Ξ =

This repulsion of vertically separated particles is due to negative sectional curvature, K−, where

(30.3)

30.3 Newton’s Gravitational Law in Geometrical Form
•
313
Thus the vertical repulsion is exactly double the horizontal attraction, as illustrated in [30.1]. We are
now poised to recognize the true geometrical signiﬁcance of this fact—the geometrical signature
of Newton’s inverse-square tidal forces. The key is to follow the evolution of the volume δV of the
sphere as it falls to Earth, the tidal forces deforming it into an ellipsoidal egg.
Imagine that the initial sphere of particles is enclosed in a cube. As the sphere falls and
deforms into an egg, the enclosing cube and its contents undergo a linear transformation that
deforms it into a box with edges of lengths 2ξ, 2ξ, and 2Ξ, and hence of volume 8ξ2 Ξ. The volume
occupied by the egg is a ﬁxed proportion of this box, so
δV = 4π
3 ξ2 Ξ.
Since you and the sphere of particles start from rest, clearly the rate of change of this volume must
initially vanish: .
δV = 0. This can be conﬁrmed by calculation:
.
δV = 4π
3
[
2ξ.

since.

Ξ.
But the tidal forces do instantly accelerate the particles of the sphere, so let us now calculate
the acceleration of the volume of the egg:
..
δV = 4π

But, initially, ξ = δr = Ξ, and we know that the horizontal attraction and vertical repulsion are
governed by (30.2) and (30.3), respectively, so,
..
δV = 4π
3
[
2..
ξ +..

(δr)2 = −4π
3 (2K+ + K−) (δr)3 = 0 !
We have arrived at the beautiful
Geometrical Signature of the Inverse-Square Tidal Forces:
The tidal forces generated by the Inverse-Square Law—and only the Inverse-
Square Law—are volume-preserving, in the precise sense that the acceleration
of the volume vanishes, so that the volume remains constant to order t2:
..
δV = 0.
(30.4)
We have not yet proved the “only” part of this proposition. To do so, suppose that ..r = f(r),
where f is an unknown function. Substituting this in place of (30.1) in the above analysis, we ﬁnd
[exercise],
..
δV = 0
=⇒
df
dr + 2f
r = 0
=⇒
f(r) ∝1
r2 ,
as was to be shown.
In the foregoing analysis we have, understandably, neglected your microscopic gravitational
ﬁeld and its inﬂuence on the particles that surround you. But suppose we remove you from the
interior of the sphere, and instead ﬁll it with extremely dense matter of density ρ. Then the sphere

314
•
Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
of particles of radius ξ = Ξ will be accelerated inward towards the centre, just as if there were a
point mass ρ δV at the centre, pulling them in with acceleration,
..
ξ = −Gρ δV
ξ2
.
Now let us compute the acceleration of the volume in this new circumstance. Since now δV = 4π
3 ξ3,
.
δV = 4πξ2.
ξ
=⇒
..
δV = 8πξ(.
ξ)2 + 4πξ2..
ξ = 8πξ(0)2 + 4πξ2
(
−Gρ δV

)
.
Thus we have discovered this
Geometrical Signature of the Inverse-Square Attraction:
Consider a sphere of volume δV that is ﬁlled with matter of density ρ, and sup-
pose that just above its surface are tiny test particles, released from rest. Instantly
they begin to accelerate towards the centre, and the inverse-square law causes the
volume they enclose to implode with an acceleration governed by this geometrical
law:
..
δV = −4πG ρ δV.
(30.5)
If we now imagine this material sphere (and its skin of test particles) to be launched with
arbitrary velocity in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, then we obtain a superposition of these two
effects: the Earth’s tidal forces start to deform the sphere into an egg of equal volume, but the
attraction of the matter within the sphere also exerts its volume-reducing effect. The net result is
that the initial sphere evolves into an egg, but with its volume shrinking in proportion to the mass
within, and in proportion to the square of the time.
30.4
The Spacetime Metric
Soon we will be able to recast the foregoing analysis in terms of Einstein’s 4-dimensional space-
time, and we will then be led very naturally to Einstein’s Gravitational Field Equation. But before
we can do that, we must ﬁrst discuss the metric structure of spacetime, and we must also learn
how to draw pictures of spacetime.
The ﬁrst thing to understand is that the local tangent-space structure is not R4 with the stan-
dard Euclidean metric; it is instead Minkowski spacetime with the Minkowski metric given by the
spacetime interval we introduced in (6.15), on page 75. (We remind the reader that we have chosen
units such that light travels one unit of distance in one unit of time, so that its speed is c = 1. In
these units, Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc2, becomes, simply, E = m, i.e., “energy is mass”!)
Thus,
ds2 = dt2 −(dx2 + dy2 + dz2) =
[
dx0]2
−
( [
dx1]2
+
[
dx2]2
+
[
dx3]2 )
.
(30.6)
This is the analogue of distance within the tangent plane to a surface at a point, and just as the
tangent plane is ﬂat, so too is Minkowski spacetime—its Riemann tensor vanishes identically.
The analogue of the true distance between neighbouring points of the surface itself is given
by the metric tensor of the curved spacetime, which is usually denoted g—it takes two vec-
tors as input, and outputs a scalar. It generalized the dot product (or scalar product), and it is
symmetrical:
g(u, v) ≡u·v = v·u = g(v, u).

30.5 Spacetime Diagrams
•
315
Just as in a 2-surface, the metric constitutes the most fundamental information about spacetime:
it deﬁnes distance, and once we know distance, we know everything: geodesics, parallel trans-
port, and Riemann curvature. If ε is a small (ultimately vanishing) connecting vector between
two neighbouring events in spacetime, then the metric tells us the Einsteinian distance between
them:
ds2 = g(ε, ε)
But recall that ds2 > 0 only when ε connects two points on the spacetime trajectory (aka
world-line) of a material particle with nonzero mass, which is constrained to travel at less than
the speed of light; in this case we say that the separation is timelike. As we stated in (6.16) on
page 76, in this case ds simply measures wristwatch time elapsed for the traveller of the world-
line. If ε is instead along a light ray (the world-line of a photon) then ds2 = 0; in this case we say
the separation is null. Finally, if ds2 < 0 we say that the separation is spacelike.
If {ei} is a set of four basis vectors—called a tetrad—which need not be orthonormal, then
we can obtain the components of the metric tensor in exactly the same way as we obtained the
components of the Ricci tensor—simply apply the tensor to pairs of basis vectors:
gij ≡g(ei, ej) = g(ej, ei) = gji.
Thus,
ds2 = g(ε, ε) = g(dxi ei, dxj ej) = g(ei, ej) dxi dxj = gij dxi dxj.
(30.7)
For example, in Minkowski spacetime, as expressed in (30.6), g00 = +1, while g11 = g22 = g33 =
−1, and gij = 0 if i ̸= j. In general, however, these gij are functions in spacetime, and gij ̸= 0 if
i ̸= j. It is important to realize that, even in ﬂat Minkowski spacetime, these components can look
drastically different, depending on the choice of coordinates. For example, if we use standard
spherical polar coordinates for the spatial coordinates, then
ds2 = dt2 −dr2 −r2(dφ2 + sin2 φ dθ2),
(30.8)
so, gtt = 1, grr = −1, gφφ = −r2, and gθθ = −r2 sin2 φ, and yet these functions describe exactly
the same, ﬂat geometry as before.
NOTE ON NOTATION: This gij-notation is universally accepted: it can be found in all modern
texts, whether they be on mathematics or on physics. So we too shall employ this notation, which
is the n-dimensional generalization of Gauss’s original (E, F, G)-notation for a 2-surface; see (4.8),
page 37. On the other hand, at least in the 2-dimensional case, we hope we have convinced you—
several times over!—of the conceptual and computational advantages of our alternative (A2, B2)-
notation. That said, into n dimensions our notation dare not tread. . . .
30.5
Spacetime Diagrams
The vast majority of humans (including the author) cannot directly visualize 4-dimensional
spacetime. How, then, can we draw diagrams that will enable us to reason geometrically about
spacetime?! The most common and useful answer to this conundrum is to simply suppress one of
the three spatial directions. More speciﬁcally, we shall draw time going up the page, and we shall
represent two (out of the three) spatial directions as forming a horizontal plane, perpendicular to
the vertical time direction.

[30.3] The Null Cone (Light Cone) in Spacetime. Time is represented by the vertical direction, and two (out of
three) spatial directions are represented by the orthogonal, horizontal directions. A ﬂash of light is emitted at an
event in spacetime, and the expanding sphere of light is represented at each time t by its circular cross section.
The entire future of the ﬂash is therefore represented by a cone, the world-lines of the photons being the null
generators of the cone. Material particles are constrained to travel at less than the speed of light, along timelike
world-lines, inside the cone.
As drastic as this loss of information may seem, symmetry often comes to our rescue: if two
of the spatial directions are physically equivalent, then discarding one of them costs us nothing.
For example, and of great upcoming importance, in [30.1] all horizontal directions—in the plane
parallel to the Earth’s surface—are indistinguishable, so if we picture this plane spanned by two
orthonormal vectors, then we can safely suppress one of them, with no loss of information. In stark
contrast to this, the vertical direction is the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld, and it is physically
quite distinct from the horizontal directions, so in a spacetime diagram we must not throw that
direction away!
But let us begin with an even more symmetrical situation: empty, ﬂat, Minkowski spacetime.
Here all spatial directions are physically indistinguishable from one another. One of the most use-
ful objects to depict in a spacetime diagram is a ﬂash of light emitted from a particular point at
a particular time—an event. This results in a sphere of light that expands one unit of distance for
every unit of time. Since Einstein tells us that material particles cannot travel faster than light, any
massive particles ejected from the same event as the light ﬂash must remain inside this expanding
sphere. How does all this look in a spacetime diagram?
Suppressing one spatial dimension, the expanding sphere of light is now represented by the
expanding circle shown in [30.3], which generates a cone. For this reason, the spacetime depiction
of the light ﬂash is called the light cone or null cone. The world-lines of material particles stay
inside this cone, as illustrated. The fundamental importance of the null cone is that its interior
therefore represents the set of events that can be inﬂuenced by the original event—it tells us about
the so-called causal structure of spacetime, i.e., can this event, here and now, cause something to
happen at that event, there and then?
The tangent vector to the world-line of a particle is called the 4-velocity of the particle. A
particle at rest has a nonzero 4-velocity: it points straight up the time axis! Note that for a massive
particle it is possible to normalize the 4-velocity in the same way that we have usually insisted
that our particles travel over a 2-surface at unit speed, but this is not possible for the 4-velocity of
a photon, because the “length” of a photon’s 4-velocity is always zero.

30.6
Einstein’s Vacuum Field Equation in Geometrical Form
In order to “derive”8 Einstein’s Vacuum Field Equation, let us return to the vacuum of space
above the Earth’s surface, and to the Newtonian inverse-square tidal forces that operate there, as
depicted in [30.1]. But now let us analyze this from the perspective of spacetime.
We have already noted in [30.1] that all horizontal directions are indistinguishable, so there is
no loss of information if we draw a spacetime diagram that only retains one such direction. There-
fore, consider any vertical great circle of the sphere, spanned by one such horizontal direction, and
the vertical direction of Earth’s gravity. As the sphere of particles falls, the tidal forces distort the
sphere into an ellipsoidal egg, but this evolution is completely and faithfully captured by looking at
the evolution of merely this single vertical, great-circle cross section of the original sphere. If we
follow just these particles as they fall, the tidal forces will distort their circle in to an ellipse, but
then the full, physical ellipsoid can be recovered simply by rotating the ellipse about its vertical
axis of symmetry.
[30.4] Spacetime Depiction of the Tidal Distortion of a Free-
Falling Sphere into an Egg. As usual, time runs vertically.
Imagine, once again, that you
are the astronaut in the centre of
this sphere. Let us draw a spacetime
diagram from your perspective. Hav-
ing turned off your jetpack, you are
in free-fall, as are the particles sur-
rounding you. Therefore, so long as
you don’t look down at the Earth,
you feel that you are simply ﬂoat-
ing, motionless, and the sphere of
particles centred on you is likewise
almost motionless . . . except that you
gradually witness the tidal evolu-
tion of the sphere into an egg. If
you do look down at the Earth, you
see it moving towards you, but you
are still at liberty to consider your-
self motionless—surely, it is the Earth
that is moving towards you!
It is from this perspective that
we have drawn [30.4], with you
being the darker world-line in the
centre. It depicts the spacetime evo-
lution of the sphere (represented by a vertical circle) into an ellipsoidal egg, as it falls to the Earth.
Here the Earth is schematically represented by the object labelled MASSIVE.
This diagram should ring a bell! It looks almost exactly like [29.11c], depicting the evolution of
a circular bundle of geodesics in the presence of sectional curvature that is positive in one direction
(causing attraction), and negative in the perpendicular direction (causing repulsion). This analogy
becomes precise if we consider the sectional curvature in spacetime, and compare (30.2) and (30.3)
with the (now 4-dimensional) Sectional Jacobi Equation, (29.21).
The 4-velocity v of the circle of particles (starting from rest) is vertical, along the time axis.
As the vertical spacetime plane containing this 4-velocity rotates around it, it passes through the
direction parallel to the Earth’s surface, with the positive, attractive sectional curvature (30.2):
8In our present state of understanding, the physical laws are irreducible: they cannot be logically derived from anything more
primitive. However, from Newton onward, consistency with other physical laws, combined with mathematical beauty, have
served as remarkably effective guiding principles that have allowed us to correctly guess some of Nature’s deepest secrets.

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
K+ = +(GM/r3).
Rotating through another right angle, the spacetime plane contains the direction of the Earth’s
gravitational ﬁeld, yielding negative, repulsive sectional curvature (30.3):
K−= −(2GM/r3).
But, of course, there is a third spatial direction that is orthogonal to these two directions, but it is
suppressed in our spacetime diagram—it is the third direction orthogonal to the time axis, lying
in the plane parallel to the Earth’s surface.
Let us spell this out in terms of an orthonormal tetrad adapted to this situation. Let e0 = v
point along the (vertical) time axis, let e1 and e2 span the plane parallel to the Earth’s surface, and
let e3 point radially away from the Earth, in the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld.
The generalization of (29.26) from 3-manifolds to 4-manifolds is that the average Kmean of the
sectional curvatures in spacetime over all planes containing e0 = v can be obtained by averaging
over just these three orthogonal planes containing e0 = v:
Π1 ≡Π(e0, e1),
Π2 ≡Π(e0, e2),
and
Π3 ≡Π(e0, e3),
.
So,
Kmean = K(Π1) + K(Π2) + K(Π3)
3
= 1
3Ricci(e0, e0) = 1
3 R00.
Very remarkably, when viewed in this geometrical way, the passage from Newton’s inverse-square
tidal forces to Einstein’s curved spacetime is completely seamless!
We saw in (30.4) that the signature of Newton’s inverse-square tidal forces is that it is volume-
preserving, and we saw in (29.29) that the acceleration of the volume is governed by the Ricci
curvature. Combining these two results, we ﬁnd that
Ricci(v, v) δV = −..
δV = 0.
(30.9)
More explicity, from (30.2) and (30.3),
R00 = K(Π1) + K(Π2) + K(Π3) = K+ + K+ + K−= GM
r3
+ GM

so
R00 = 0.
(30.10)
Here we have imagined that the sphere of particles starts from rest, so that v = e0 is a purely
vertical 4-velocity, along the time axis. But we know that the volume-preserving signature of New-
ton’s tidal forces continues to hold if we launch the sphere with any velocity, and therefore (30.9)
holds for any timelike 4-velocity v.
The ﬁnal step in the derivation of Einstein’s Vacuum Field Equation depends on the symmetry,
(29.28), of Ricci:
Ricci(x, y) = Ricci(y, x).

=
2 Ricci(x, y).
We have thus arrived at the
Einstein Vacuum Field Equation:
Ricci = 0
⇐⇒
Rik = 0.
(30.11)
Let us not forget where this came from and what it means:
In vacuum, in order for the tidal forces to preserve volume, positive sectional
curvatures must be perfectly balanced by negative sectional curvatures, so as to
exactly cancel each other out on average.
While the Ricci curvature vanishes identically in vacuum, this is only the volume-reducing
average of the positive and negative sectional curvatures. The Riemann tensor itself certainly does
not vanish in general; witness the positive and negative tidal curvatures in (30.2) and (30.3).
In general, it is possible to split the Riemann curvature into a volume-reducing Ricci part,
plus a purely tidal, volume-preserving part, called the Weyl curvature; see Exercise 15. This split
is most elegantly and naturally accomplished via Penrose’s 2-spinor formalism; see Penrose and
Rindler (1984, §4.6) or Wald (1984, §13.2).
Lest you doubt that (30.11) is in fact Einstein’s equation, [30.5] shows Einstein himself
proudly writing it down, and while he has modestly added a question mark, his equation now
encompasses a remarkable array of startling, testable predictions, all of which have been conﬁrmed
experimentally, often with extraordinary precision.
We shall outline several of these experimental triumphs, but their mathematical derivations
must be left to the technical references we will provide, as well as to those in the General Relativity
section of Further Reading, at the end of this book.
30.7
The Schwarzschild Solution and the First Tests of the Theory
When we speak of a solution to Einstein’s equation, we mean a geometry of spacetime (deﬁned by
its metric) that satisﬁes the equation.
The single most important such solution (at least historically) describes the spacetime in the
vacuum region outside a spherically symmetric (nonspinning) mass, M. This solution, the ﬁrst
exact solution ever found, was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild9 (1873–1916)—shown in [30.6]—
almost instantly after Einstein announced his theory. Schwarzschild discovered it while on active
duty on the Russian front, as a 42-year-old artillery leftenant in the German army during World
War I. He sent the solution to Einstein in a letter dated the 22nd of December, 1915:
9Schwarzschild was a child prodigy, publishing papers on celestial mechanics when he was 16 years old. Later, from 1901 to
1909, he was a professor at Göttingen, where his colleagues included Hilbert, Klein, and Minkowski.

As you see, the war treated me kindly enough, in spite of the heavy gunﬁre, to allow me
to get away from it all and take this walk in the land of your ideas.
Decades later, physicists would slowly come to realize that Schwarzschild’s solution not only
describes the geometry surrounding a spherical mass, such as the Sun or the Earth, it also describes
the pure vacuum gravitational ﬁeld of a black hole!
Schwarzschild’s solution builds on the spherical polar metric formula of Minkowski
spacetime, (30.8):

(30.13)
Einstein and others were initially confused by this, and thought this meant that there was
something singular about spacetime itself when r = rs. However, this ultimately turned
out to be a nonphysical artifact of the particular choice of coordinates. If an object of length l
is located at the Schwarzschild radius, it experiences ordinary, nonsingular tidal forces of
order (GM/r3s) l, in other words, of order (c6l/G2) (1/M2).
•
If the mass M is extremely large, then the tidal forces at the Schwarzschild radius are
extremely small.
•
If the spherical star or planet has radius R, then the solution only applies the vacuum region
outside it, i.e., r > R. In the interior, r < R, a quite different metric applies, which satisﬁes the
full Einstein Field Equation (with matter), which we shall derive shortly. In the case of a
sphere of uniform density, the same Karl Schwarzschild found the exact solution to this
nonvacuum equation, almost immediately after ﬁnding the vacuum solution; it is called,
logically enough, the Interior Schwarzschild Solution.
•
For the Sun, which has a radius of 430,000 miles, the Schwarzschild radius is only 2 miles!
The Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is only about a third of an inch! Thus we must
switch from the vacuum Schwarzschild solution to a different interior solution long before
we get anywhere near the Schwarzschild radius.

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
Although the Earth and the Sun do spin, Schwarzschild’s solution is nevertheless an excellent
approximation10 to the spacetime geometry of both. Indeed this solution sufﬁces to give a com-
plete analysis of our solar system, and to make three crucial predictions about phenomena in our
Solar System that deviate from Newton’s theory.
In the interest of historical accuracy, we must point out that all three of these initial predictions
were made by Einstein before he knew Schwarzschild’s exact solution. Einstein did so by means
of an approximate solution to his equation, which—bizarrely and inelegantly—he obtained using
rectangular coordinates!
Here were Einstein’s three initial predictions/tests of his theory:
1. When light travels upward through a gravitational ﬁeld, its frequency should be reduced—
we say it is redshifted. Einstein made this prediction in 1907, long before had discovered the
ﬁeld equation, and thus it is not a direct test of that equation. Nevertheless, had experiments
denied this prediction, the entire framework of Einstein’s theory would have been invalidated.
Sadly, the ﬁrst deﬁnitive, terrestrial conﬁrmation of this prediction was not carried out by
Pound and Rebka until 1959, four years after Einstein’s death.
2. The major axis of the elliptical orbit of Mercury rotates a minuscule amount with each orbit.
Newtonian theory predicted that the rotation per century should be 532 arcseconds—less than
one degree. However, Urbain Le Verrier and later Simon Newcomb conducted extremely
accurate analyses of observations collected since 1697, and by 1882 they had established
that the actual rotation of the orbit was 575 arcseconds per century—a discrepancy of 43
arcseconds per century: a fantastically small (but also indelible and mysterious) blemish on
Newton’s theory.
When Einstein calculated the correction according to his own law of gravitation, it made
a deﬁnite, unambiguous prediction—whatever the verdict, there could be no appeal.
Einstein’s formula yielded 43 arcseconds per century! In that moment, Einstein realized that
Nature had spoken to him—his law was built into the eternal structure of the world. Mer-
cury’s orbit had been rotating at this rate 4 billion years before mankind existed, and it would
continue to do so billions of years into the future.
Einstein told one friend that, in that moment, he had experienced physical heart palpi-
tations; he told another friend that he felt that something actually “snapped” inside him. See
Pais (1982, p. 253).
3. Einstein also calculated that light passing close to the rim of the Sun should be bent by 1.75
arcseconds. But starlight grazing the Sun can only be seen during a total solar eclipse, so the
prediction could not be tested until one occurred, which happened on the 29th of May, 1919.
In anticipation of the eclipse, Sir Arthur Eddington organized expeditions to Brazil and west
Africa, in order to take the critical photographs during the brief eclipse, and to perform the
measurement of the deﬂection, indeed, to see if there were any deﬂection.
The dramatic conﬁrmation of Einstein’s prediction of the bending of light, and the pre-
cise amount by which it was bent, was an international sensation, splashed across the front
pages of newspapers around the world. Overnight, the unknown German scientist became a
household name, and “Einstein” became a synonym for genius.
After these early triumphs, there followed several fallow decades, in which physicists shifted
their attention to all things quantum. However, beginning in the 1960s, General Relativity
underwent something of a renaissance, which has continued to the present day, attracting the

New Zealand mathematician, Roy Kerr (born 1934); accordingly, it is called the Kerr solution. For Kerr’s personal account of
his remarkable discovery, see Kerr (2008) and Wiltshire et al. (2009).

ﬁnest theoreticians and experimentalists, with many new theoretical predictions, and many new
experimental conﬁrmations.
Some of these newer tests still depend on the simple Schwarzschild solution of 1915. Our
successful daily use of GPS navigation—see Taylor and Wheeler (2000, §A-1)—is one of these
newer conﬁrmations of both Einstein’s theory and Schwarzschild’s solution!
Tragically, Schwarzschild himself did not live to see any of these triumphs: he died of a rare
autoimmune disease on the 11th of May, 1916, mere months after discovering his two remarkable
solutions of Einstein’s equation. In remembering him, Sir Arthur Eddington wrote, “. . . his joy
was to range unrestricted over the pastures of knowledge, and, like a guerrilla leader, his attacks
fell where they were least expected.”
30.8
Gravitational Waves
Other conﬁrmations of Einstein’s equation have arisen from completely different kinds of solu-
tions to the vacuum ﬁeld equation, (30.11). As we ﬁrst outlined on page 231, the existence of
gravitational waves was predicted by Einstein in 1916, and the very ﬁrst experimental detection
of a gravitational wave occurred almost exactly a century later, on the 14th of September, 2015.
We are accustomed to the idea that electromagnetic waves—such as the light by means of
which we see the world—are photons travelling through space. Gravitational waves are some-
thing astonishingly different: they are ripples of curvature in the fabric of spacetime itself! But not
just any old ripples are possible: like the Schwarzschild solution, they must satisfy the Einstein
vacuum equation. They are oscillating waves of pure tidal force that have broken free from the
violent events that created them, travelling out across space (as space!) at the speed of light.
As a gravitational wave passes through a sphere of particles at a ﬁxed location, it has no effect
on the particles whose separation lies in the travel direction of the wave. But in the plane orthogonal
to direction of the wave, it causes oscillating, tidal, egg deformation, stretching the sphere in one
direction, and compressing it in the orthogonal direction. See [30.7a], which shows the ﬁeld lines
(i.e., streamlines of the tidal force ﬁeld) at one particular moment.
The tidal force ﬁeld of the gravitational wave is different in character from the tidal force ﬁeld
in the vacuum above the Earth, in two important respects:
•
First, whereas the gravitational wave only compresses in one direction orthogonal to the
stretching direction, the Earth’s tidal force ﬁeld compresses in both orthogonal directions.
•
Second, the Einstein vacuum equation tells us that the positive curvatures in any two orthog-
onal directions lying within the plane parallel to the Earth’s surface must exactly cancel the
negative curvature in the radial direction of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Therefore these
two positive curvatures must each be half as strong as the radial negative curvature, as illus-
trated in [30.1]. But in the case of the gravitational wave, the curvature associated with the
direction of travel vanishes. Therefore the Einstein equation tells us that the remaining two
curvatures must cancel, and must therefore be of equal strength. In other words, in [30.7a] the
stretching force in the horizontal direction must equal the compressing force in the vertical
direction, as illustrated.
Returning to [30.7a], the dashed circle of particles is initially deformed into the solid ellipse.
But, half a wavelength later, the tidal forces have completely ﬂipped, as illustrated in [30.7b]: now
there is compression in the direction where the wave previously caused stretching, and visa versa.
As the wave passes, the force ﬁeld oscillates back and forth between these two opposite patterns
of force.

[30.7] The Oscillating Tidal Force Field of a Gravitational Wave. As the gravitational wave passes through a
sphere of particles, it has no effect on the particles whose separation lies in the travel direction of the wave,
which is here taken to be perpendicular to the page. In the plane orthogonal to this direction of travel, the wave
causes oscillating expansion and contraction in two perpendicular directions, here shown as horizontal and
vertical. Figure [a] shows the deformation of the (dashed) circle of test particles into the (solid) ellipse. Figure [b]
shows the reversal of the tidal force ﬁeld of the wave, half a wavelength later, now with the stretching orthogonal
to the original stretching. As the wave passes, the force ﬁeld oscillates back and forth between these two opposite
patterns.
As we discussed in Section 19.2, in general a phase portrait cannot represent the magnitude of
the underlying vector ﬁeld. In [30.7a] we have merely drawn a few random ﬁeld lines, and there
is no way to tell how strong the tidal forces are by looking at this. However, suppose the vector
ﬁeld is divergence-free, like an electric ﬁeld in vacuum. If we draw the ﬁeld lines in such a way
that their density/crowding is proportional to the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in one place, then,
as we follow the ﬁeld lines away from that place, the density of ﬁeld lines in the new place will
automatically continue11 to faithfully represent the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the new place.
So, although we have not done so in [30.7a], the streamlines for the gravitational wave’s tidal force
ﬁeld can also be drawn in this way, because (as we now explain) it too is divergence-free.
If we take the plane [30.7] to be the complex plane, then the tidal force ﬁeld in [30.7a] looks like
the saddle point (aka crosspoint) ﬁrst encountered in [19.4h] (p. 200), representing the complex
function (1/z). However, the Jacobi Equation tells us that the tidal force of the gravitational wave
actually increases linearly with distance from the origin, and so it is represented by z = x −iy, i.e.,
by the “Pólya vector ﬁeld of z”; see page 201. Thus,
∇·
[
x
−y
]
= 0.
NOTE: One can also understand this from a more advanced point of view: the Pólya vector
ﬁelds of all complex-analytic functions are automatically divergence-free (and curl-free); see VCA,
page 483.
But the above interaction between the wave and the sphere of test particles is unbelievably
weak. Einstein himself doubted that we would ever be able to detect his waves. While Einstein
did indeed underestimate our future technological prowess, more signiﬁcantly, he could not have
imagined the extraordinary violence of cosmic events capable of generating gravitational waves. We

will now describe one such event, which converted astonishing quantities of energy (in a fraction of
a second!) into hugely powerful gravitational waves—veritable “tidal waves” [sic] in spacetime,
that were capable of triggering detectors on Earth after spreading out and travelling for more than
a billion years!
This 2015 detection of the ﬁrst gravitational wave (at two independent detectors) was epoch-
making in and of itself, but the scientists were able to go much further: they used Einstein’s
equation to work backwards from the details of the detected signal to determine, in remarkable
detail, the cataclysmic event that had created the gravitational waves.
We will let one of these Nobel Prize–winning scientists, Kip Thorne, speak for himself. (Note
that M⊙denotes the mass of our Sun.)
On September 14, 2015, the advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors made their ﬁrst
detection: a wave burst named GW150914 with amplitude 1.0 × 10−21, duration ∼150ms,
and frequency chirping up from ∼50Hz (when entering the LIGO band) to 240Hz. By
comparing the observed waveform with those from numerical relativity simulations,
the LIGO-VIRGO scientists deduced that the waves came from the merger of a 29M⊙
Black Hole with a 36M⊙Black Hole, 1.2 billion light years from Earth, to form a 62M⊙
Black Hole, with a release of 3M⊙c2 of energy in gravitational waves.—(Thorne and
Blandford 2017, p. 1346)
We cannot allow the enormity of the energy release to pass without comment. Einstein’s
E = mc2 translates this statement as saying that during the last fraction of a second of the black hole col-
lision, the equivalent of three times the mass of our Sun was converted into gravitational wave energy. What
does that mean? Let us begin with a grim but familiar instantiation of E = mc2: the atomic bomb
that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945, killing 75,000 people. In that atomic blast, the total amount of
matter that was converted into energy weighed less than a single raisin. Let that sink in.
How, then, can we even conceive of the entire mass of our Sun being converted into gravi-
tational wave energy?! Thorne and Blandford (2017, §27.5.5) offer this interpretation: in the last
tenth of a second of the observed black hole collision, the power output generating the GW150914
gravitational wave was 100 times the luminosity of all the stars in the observable Universe combined!
For the fullest, most up-to-date—as of this writing!—technical treatment of the generation,
propagation, and detection of gravitational waves, see Thorne and Blandford (2017, §27), and
Schutz (2021).
Several more gravitational waves have been detected since GW150914.12 In 2017 the same sci-
entists achieved another ﬁrst: they detected a burst, GW170817, which Einstein’s equation allowed
them to decode as arising from the merger of two neutron stars! Using the prescient theoretical
work of Schutz (1986),13 from 30 years earlier, these gravitational wave scientists were then able
to use this data (in combination with optical data) to calculate the Hubble constant in a totally
novel way, shining new light on the expansion of the Universe! Clearly, we have entered a new
era of gravitational wave astronomy.
Likewise, the gravitational bending and focusing of light, which Sir Arthur Eddington was
the ﬁrst to witness in 1919, has now led to gravitational lensing: a technique that harnesses the
gravitational focusing of light (and radio waves) as a tool for the study of very faint and distant
objects.
Thus, in hindsight, our testing of Einstein’s theory has been akin to looking down the wrong
end of a telescope, checking to see if its lenses have been correctly conﬁgured. Scientists are now
looking through the theory from the correct end, gazing out into spacetime, and using Einstein’s

equation to witness and decipher phenomena that would otherwise have remained invisible and
inexplicable.
Everything we have described thus far has depended only on Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equa-
tion, (30.11). Even the black holes that generated GW150914 were describable by solutions of the
vacuum equation, as were the gravitational waves themselves. But without the matter within the
stars that collapsed billions of years ago, there would have been no black holes, no black hole
collision, and no emitted gravitational waves!
We therefore now turn to the full Einstein Field Equation, with matter.

[30.8] Spacetime Depiction of
the Volume Reduction of a
Free-Falling Sphere Containing
Matter. As usual, time runs ver-
tically.
Figure [30.4] illustrated the volume-preserving effect of the tidal
forces when our sphere of particles enclosed only a vacuum.
Figure [30.8] is instead a spacetime depiction of the volume-
reducing effect when matter is present within the sphere. Again,
this picture should ring a bell! It is almost exactly like [29.11b]!
And, once again, this is no accident: [30.8] shows the effect—
via the Sectional Jacobi Equation, (29.21)—of purely positive
sectional curvatures in the presence of matter.
If the volume δV is ﬁlled with matter of density ρ, the New-
tonian, volume-reducing acceleration is given by (30.5), but,
in spacetime terms, this is again described by the average of
the sectional curvatures, i.e, by the Ricci curvature formula,
(29.29). Therefore, combining these results, we ﬁnd that
Ricci(v, v) δV = −..
δV = 4πGρδV,
and therefore
Ricci(v, v) = 4πGρ.
(30.14)
To make further progress, we must express the right-hand
side of this equation in terms of the tensor that describes matter
and energy in both Special and General Relativity. In common
with the Ricci tensor, this new tensor, denoted T, takes two
vectors as input, and outputs a scalar. It is called the energy–
momentum tensor or, equally commonly, the stress–energy ten-
sor. Like the Ricci tensor, it is symmetric:
T(w, v) = T(v, w)
⇐⇒
Tki = Tik.
(30.15)
Despite appearances to the contrary, this is not (at least pri-
marily!) a physics book, so for a full description of T we must
refer the reader to Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) or Thorne
and Blandford (2017). For our purposes, the key feature of T
is that for an observer with (normalized) 4-velocity v, the total
density of matter and energy is given by
T(v, v) = ρmatter + ρenergy ≡ρtotal.
Recall that Einstein discovered that matter and energy are equivalent, so both of them curve
spacetime. For example, the electromagnetic ﬁeld has an energy density that Maxwell discovered

30.9 The Einstein Field Equation (with Matter) in Geometrical Form

to be proportional to (|E|2 + |B|2), where E is the electric ﬁeld, and B is the magnetic ﬁeld. This
electromagnetic energy curves spacetime just as surely as a planet does. Other ﬁelds, too, must be
added in to obtain the complete energy–momentum tensor.
Thus, taking these relativistic effects into account, (30.14) becomes
Ricci(v, v) = 4πGρtotal = 4π T(v, v).
(30.16)
Note, for future comparison, that if we use the same tetrad as before, with v = e0, then
R00 = 4πGρtotal.
(30.17)
But (30.16) is true if v is an arbitrary timelike vector. So, using the same trick as before, writing
v = x + y and appealing to the symmetry of T, we deduce [exercise] that
Ricci = 4πG T
⇐⇒
Rik = 4πG Tik.
(30.18)
This was in fact one of Einstein’s original proposals for his ﬁeld equation, beginning in 1913.
(Of course if T = 0 then it reduces to the (physically correct) vacuum equation, (30.11).) Indeed,
Einstein still believed in (30.18) as late as the 11th of November, 1915, exactly two weeks prior to
his discovery of the correct, ﬁnal ﬁeld equation of General Relativity, on the 25th of November. For
more on Einstein’s decade-long struggle towards the correct equation, see Misner, Thorne, and
Wheeler (1973, §17.7), or, better yet, Pais (1982, §14), which chronicles (essentially day by day)
Einstein’s mental thrashings throughout that fateful November.
The modern way to recognize the fatal ﬂaw inherent in (30.18) is to observe that if this equation
were true, the Differential Bianchi Identity, (29.17), would imply that energy is not conserved! To fully
explain this would take us too far aﬁeld, but the essential mathematical fact is derived in Exercise
14. To properly understand the physics, we refer you to Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973, §17),
or Penrose (2005, §19.6), or Thorne and Blandford (2017, §25.8), or Wald (1984, §4.3). As we noted
earlier, we should also point out that this is not how Einstein ﬁnally arrived at the truth, because
in 1915 he did not know the Differential Bianchi Identity! See Pais (1982, p. 256).
The upshot is that the Differential Bianchi Identity almost uniquely determines the correction
that must be made to (30.18) in order for conservation of energy to be restored.
To make this correction, we introduce the trace of the energy–momentum tensor:
T ≡Tmm = ρtotal −(P1 + P2 + P3) ,
where P1, P2, P3 are the pressures within the matter in our three orthogonal spatial directions, e1,
e2, e3. Note that while pressure and density may seem very different concepts, a connection can
be seen as follows:
pressure = force
area = force × distance
volume
= energy
volume =
mass
volume = density.
We can now state the correct, ﬁnal form of the Einstein Field Equation:
Ricci = 8πG
[
T −1

]
⇐⇒
Rik = 8πG
[
Tik −1

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
We note that this is not how you will ﬁnd the equation written in almost all texts on General
Relativity. Nevertheless, this is how Einstein himself originally wrote his equation, on the 25th of
November, 1915! See Pais (1982, p. 256).
Let us state the more standard, mathematically equivalent form, though we leave the short
proof to the technical references above:
Ricci −1
2Rg = 8πG T
⇐⇒
Rik −1
2Rgik = 8πG Tik,
(30.20)
where R ≡Rmm is the trace of Ricci, called the curvature scalar. The tensor on the left-hand side,
G ≡Ricci −1
2R g,
(30.21)
is called the Einstein tensor.14 This notation leads to (by far) the most common way of writing
Einstein’s equation:15,16
G = 8πG T.
(30.22)
The ﬁnal Einstein Field Equation, (30.19), appears very different from the original equation,
(30.18), to which we were naturally led by our geometrical reasoning regarding Newton’s Inverse-
Square Law. In reality, they differ very little. Indeed, we now show that, physically, the Einstein
equation only adds a correction to the original Newtonian equation, a correction that is extremely
small under normal circumstances.
To see this, again choose the time axis along the observer’s 4-velocity: e0 = v. Then, since
g00 = 1, we ﬁnd that
R00 = 8πG
[
T00 −1
2Tg00
]
= 8πG
[
ρtotal −1
2
{
ρtotal −(P1 + P2 + P3)
}]
,
so
R00 = 4πG
(
ρtotal + P1 + P2 + P3
)
.
(30.23)
Comparing this to our original, Newtonian-based equation, (30.17), we see that Einstein’s
equation only differs by the addition of the three pressure terms, and for matter under normal
circumstances these terms are tiny compared to the mass/energy term, ρtotal.
It is important to remember the signiﬁcance of the Ricci tensor, and hence of (30.23)—it tells
us the volume-compressing effect of the spacetime curvature, via (29.29). We have ﬁnally arrived at the
Einstein Field Equation in geometrical form:
..
δV = −R00 δV = −4πG
(
ρtotal + P1 + P2 + P3
)
δV.
(30.24)
14For more on the geometry of the Einstein tensor, see Frankel (2011, §4).
15We remind the reader that the deﬁnition of the Ricci curvature varies, affecting its sign; thus, for example, Penrose (2005,
§19.6) instead writes G = −8πG T.
16It is also common to use geometrized units, in which both c = 1 and G = 1, in which case Einstein’s equation becomes,
simply, G = 8π T.

30.10 Gravitational Collapse to a Black Hole

30.10 Gravitational Collapse to a Black Hole
During the normal life of a star, it is the continuous hydrogen bomb–like explosion within it that
makes the star shine and that keeps the material of the star from collapsing inward under its own
weight. But the star eventually exhausts its supply of its primary nuclear fuel, hydrogen, and as
the nuclear ﬁre goes out, the star starts to lose its power to resist gravity. Let us brieﬂy consider
the fate of normal star as its endgame begins.
In the course of gravitational collapse, the temperature and pressure can rise to the point that
new nuclear reactions begin, renewing the ﬁght against gravity by burning helium, and heavier
elements. Also, the extreme circumstances of gravitational collapse can even cause the atoms
themselves to be crushed, at which point, new quantum-mechanical forces resist the collapse, by
virtue of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
Precisely which nuclear reactions and which quantum-mechanical forces become dominant,
and in what sequence, is the complicated dance17 that governs the death throes of a star. But the
key piece of information that largely determines this ultimate path is the initial mass M of the star.
Small stars (like our Sun) with M < 8 M⊙may end up as stable white dwarfs, in which
quantum-mechanical electron degeneracy pressure prevents further collapse. But much larger
stars, with M > 10 M⊙, may ultimately go supernova, with much of the material of the star being
exploded out into space, leaving only a core behind that then undergoes gravitational collapse. If
the original star has M < 30 M⊙, then it is possible that the collapse of the postsupernova core will
be halted by neutron degeneracy pressure (and other forces), leading to the formation of a stable,
rapidly spinning neutron star.
But Einstein’s equation predicts that if the collapsing core is sufﬁciently massive, something
counterintuitive and almost paradoxical-seeming can happen, resulting in the creation of a black
hole.
In the extreme circumstances of such a gravitational collapse, the pressure terms in Einstein’s
equation, (30.24), can become very signiﬁcant as the matter is compressed and the speed of the
atoms approaches the speed of light. Ordinary physical intuition tells us that these internal pres-
sures will ﬁght the collapse and perhaps even halt it. But, on the contrary, the Einstein equation
tells us that the mounting pressures only increase the volume-crushing power of gravity! The
harder the star ﬁghts its collapse, the more gravity tightens its stranglehold.
If, ultimately, the postsupernova core that undergoes gravitational collapse has a mass that is
greater than about18 2 M⊙—the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, TOV for short—this purely
Einsteinian effect leads to a point of no return: now no force in the Universe can halt the collapse.
See [30.9]. Gravity will relentlessly crush the entire core down to a point of inﬁnite density and
inﬁnite tidal forces at r = 0, called a spacetime singularity. After the collapse has ﬁnished, what
remains is a pure, vacuum gravitational ﬁeld.19
Imagine that ﬂashes of light are emitted from the centre of the core during the collapse, and
further imagine that these ﬂashes can pass through through the matter of the core, as though they
were neutrinos. The fate of an individual ﬂash depends on when it is emitted. If the ﬂash is emitted
early enough, then, as illustrated, it is able to escape the gravitational ﬁeld.
But there comes a critical moment when the ﬂash from the centre expands at ﬁrst but then
slows and ultimately hovers at the Schwarzschild radius, rs = (2GM/c2). This hovering sphere of
light is the event horizon, and its interior is a black hole: no matter or information can escape this

19Birkhoff’s Theorem tells us that as the spherical mass M shrinks and remains spherical, the geometry of the vacuum outside
it must be the Schwarzschild solution, and that the M-value in the metric does not change as the object’s radius R shrinks; the
only change is the size of the vacuum region r > R to which the solution applies.

[30.9] The Birth of a Black Hole: the Gravitational Collapse of a Postsupernova Core. Einstein’s ﬁeld equation
tells us that the collapse of a core of sufﬁcient mass will reach a point of no return: gravity will relentlessly crush
the entire core down to a point of inﬁnite density and inﬁnite tidal forces at r = 0, called a spacetime singularity;
what remains is a pure, vacuum gravitational ﬁeld. If a ﬂash is emitted from the centre of the collapsing core
early enough, it can escape the gravitational ﬁeld. But there comes a critical moment when the ﬂash from the
centre expands at ﬁrst but then slows and ultimately hovers at the Schwarzschild radius, rs = (2GM/c2). This
hovering sphere of light is the event horizon, and its interior is a black hole: no matter or information can escape

to pass inwards, but never outwards, for matter must always travel inside the null cones.
region once it has been formed. The null cones are tangent to the horizon and so they allow matter
and light to pass inwards, but never outwards, for matter must always travel inside the null cones.
Therefore, once an object has fallen into the black hole, it is relentlessly dragged towards the
central singularity, and the tidal forces exerted on it grow in proportion to (1/r3). Any solid object
must ultimately succumb to these rapidly growing tidal forces, being stretched out in the radial
direction, and compressed in the perpendicular directions. As the tidal forces tends to inﬁnity, this
process will stretch/compress the object into a long thin shape, like a piece of spaghetti. For this
reason, physicists actually call this process spaghettiﬁcation!

Black holes can also form in other ways. We have mentioned that a gravitational wave
(GW170817) detected in 2017 originated from two neutron stars spiralling around and into each
other, ﬁnally colliding and merging. After the merger, the resulting object’s mass exceeded the
TOV limit. Remarkably, the gravitational wave scientists were able to spatially localize the source
to a sufﬁciently small patch of the southern sky that traditional X-ray astronomers were then able
to look there, successfully identifying and studying the aftermath of the neutron-star collision.
This X-ray data now seems to conﬁrm that the merged neutron stars immediately underwent full
collapse to form a black hole!
We now know that the Universe is littered with black holes of these types, a few solar masses
each. However, in addition, astronomers have now conﬁrmed that almost every galaxy (including
our own Milky Way) has, at its centre, a totally different kind of black hole—a supermassive black
hole that is millions or even thousands of millions times more massive than our Sun! Although astro-
physicists have hypothesized different mechanisms by which they might have been formed, the
true origin of the supermassive black holes remains a mystery.
As we noted earlier, if a body of linear dimensions l passes through the event horizon of
a black hole of mass M, the tidal forces exerted on it there are of order (c6l/G2) (1/M2), which
gets smaller as M gets bigger. For a supermassive black hole with M = 108 M⊙, this force is much
less than the tidal force we experience on the surface of the Earth! Thus, if you were to ﬂy your
spaceship into such black hole, you would not even realize that you had done so—you would feel
nothing as you crossed the event horizon.
Nevertheless, regardless of the power of your spaceship’s engines (and how you might
attempt to deploy them), after you cross the horizon, the maximum time you have till you hit
the singularity is proportional to the mass of the black hole, and is given by20
tmax =
M
M⊙
× 15.5 × 10−6 seconds.
If you were “lucky enough” to ﬂy your spaceship into a black hole of sufﬁcient mass—a few
galaxies’ worth of mass will do!—then you could even live inside the black hole for years thereafter;
remember, your friends outside the hole can still send care packages into the hole.
However, for more realistic supermassive black holes, the outlook is more grim. For example,
the black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy (called Sagittarius A*) has an estimated
mass21 M = 3.6 × 106 M⊙, so if you were to cross its horizon, your maximum survival time would
be less than one minute!
Regardless of tmax, once you have entered a black hole, there can be no escape—sadly, your
ultimate and completely inevitable demise is spaghettiﬁcation!
30.11 The Cosmological Constant: “The Greatest Blunder of My Life.”
We began this chapter with Einstein’s happiest thought, and we shall end it with his least happy
thought.
But this seemingly sad movie has a sudden, bizarre, superhappy plot twist at the very end!
Indeed, after the curtain falls, and you ﬁnally walk through the exit door of Act IV, you will
probably be muttering to yourself, “That could never happen in real life!”
20See Taylor and Wheeler (2000, §3–21).
21Measurements in 2018 revised upward the earlier estimate of M = 2.6 × 106 M⊙.

Chapter 30 Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
In 1916 the widespread belief (based more on philosophy than science) was that the Universe
was static, unchanging. But Einstein’s ﬁeld equation was quickly discovered to be in conﬂict with
this idea—it automatically led to a Universe that was expanding or contracting.
Mind you, at this time, the “Universe” was thought to comprise only of our Milky Way
galaxy—the existence of galaxies beyond our own was ﬁrst discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1924.
In order to salvage a static Universe,22 Einstein employed a daring and desperate gambit—
despite the fact that it was the fruit of ten years of intense labour, he changed his ﬁeld equation,
(30.22)!
We have noted that the Differential Bianchi Identity, (29.17), almost uniquely determines the
change that must be made to Einstein’s original equation (30.18) in order to restore conservation
of energy. However, Einstein realized that there remained one, and only one, additional freedom
in his equation: he could add to the left-hand side a constant multiple Λ of the metric tensor, g.
Einstein made this change to his equation in 1917, and to distinguish this new equation from
the original 1915 equation, we shall call it the
Cosmological Einstein Field Equation:
G + Λg = 8πG T.
(30.25)
If true, this constant Λ—which is called the cosmological constant—would need to be extraordi-
narily small to avoid conﬂict with observational evidence. At the scale of the solar system, or even
the galaxy, the new Cosmological Field Equation would then make the same predictions as the
original ﬁeld equation. Only at the cosmological scale would its predictions be starkly different.
In 1929, twelve years after Einstein had made this change to his equation, Edwin Hubble
made a second extraordinary discovery. Building on his earlier discovery of galaxies beyond our
own, he sought to measure their distances from us and then to correlate those distances with the
radial speed of the galaxies (measured using their redshifts). He found that the galaxies all had
velocities directed away from us, and that these velocities of the galaxies were proportional to their
distances from us. This is now known as Hubble’s Law.
Thus the Universe was not static, after all—it was expanding! Einstein realized that if he had
only remained faithful to his original equation of 1915, he could have made the most extraordi-
nary scientiﬁc prediction in human history! He told George Gamow that his introduction of the
cosmological constant had been, “The greatest blunder of my life.” Thereafter, Einstein retracted the
Cosmological Field Equation in favour of the original.
In subsequent decades, many (most?) experts tended to side with Einstein’s retraction, believ-
ing that Λ was identically zero, and that the more elegant, original Einstein equation was correct.
Nevertheless, once the Λ-genie was out of the bottle, it was impossible to put it back in. Thus,
research papers always tended to hedge their bets, at least examining how their conclusions might
be affected if Λ ̸= 0.
We now leap forward in time to 1998, and to a cosmological discovery23 as great as Hubble’s
discovery, 70 years earlier. Although Hubble had found that the Universe was expanding, the
expectation had been that the positive, attracting gravitational pull of the matter within would
slow the expansion of the Universe over time. However, by observing type Ia supernovas—which
are exploding white dwarfs that have exceeded their stability limit, and which therefore have sim-
ilar masses and therefore standardized intrinsic luminosity—the scientists made the astonishing
discovery that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating!
But how can we explain this gobsmacking discovery?! Einstein’s answer had been sitting there,
patiently waiting, since 1917!
22The full story of Einstein’s motivations is far more complex and subtle. See Pais (1982, §15c).
23The discovery was made by two independent research teams, and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was divided, one-half
awarded to Saul Perlmutter, the other half jointly to Brian P. Schmidt and Adam G. Riess.

30.12 The End
•
333
If Λ > 0, then (moving Λg to the right-hand side of the equation) its effect is mathematically
equivalent to a ﬁctitious24 negative energy density ρ = −(Λ/8πG), resulting in gravitational repulsion.
While [30.8] illustrates the attractive nature of ordinary matter, and positive sectional curvatures,
the opposite behaviour in the presence of negative energy and negative sectional curvatures is illus-
trated in [29.11a], page 301. When viewed as a spacetime picture of the expansion of the Universe,
this shows the repulsive effect of negative energy arising from a positive value of Λ, evidently
resulting in accelerating expansion of the Universe.
In short, the observed accelerating expansion of the Universe agrees (in detail) with the Cos-
mological Einstein Field equation, with Λ > 0. This, then, is the happy, scarcely believable, ﬁnal
plot twist: Einstein’s “greatest blunder” turned out to be, instead, one of his greatest strokes of
genius!
30.12 The End
We hope that these ﬁnal two chapters of Act IV have inspired you to grapple in greater depth
with the connected wonders of Riemann’s curvature and Einstein’s curved spacetime. However,
we must stop here—a full explanation would require Volumes 2 and 3!
If we have done our job, you cannot wait to learn more—let the Further Reading section at the
end of this book be your guide. There we recommend many excellent works, each with its own,
distinctive spécialité de la maison.
That said, let us impatiently assert that we can think of no smoother or faster road to enlight-
enment than Penrose’s Road to Reality (2005), for it contains his countless original and revelatory
insights into both the mathematics and the physics, all expressed with astonishing clarity by
means of his singularly beautiful hand drawings.
For even greater technical detail, we also strongly recommend—see Prologue—Gravitation
by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973). And for more up-to-date developments, especially on
gravitational waves and modern cosmology, we highly recommend the massive and authoritative
work, Modern Classical Physics, by Thorne and Blandford (2017).
Last, after reading Act V, we recommend Dray (2015), which uses Forms to clarify the geo-
metry of General Relativity. Indeed, it is to Forms that we now turn, for they are the subject of our
ﬁnal Act.
But, as for our treatment of purely Visual Differential Geometry, this is, ﬁnally, the end.
24While I am personally content to accept the Cosmological Field Equation with Λ > 0, many famous scientists instead believe
that there exists an actual, nonﬁctitious thing, permeating the entire Universe, that causes this repulsion—they call it dark
energy.

Exercises for Act IV
Extrinsic Constructions
1. Geodesic Curvature on the Sphere. On the sphere of radius R, suppose a particle travels at
unit speed along the circle at latitude ϕ.
(i) What is the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of the particle?
(ii) Sketch the projection of this acceleration onto the tangent plane of the sphere, and deduce
that the geodesic curvature is κg = cot ϕ
R
.
(iii) Verify that this formula for κg yields the geometrically correct answer as ϕ →0 and as
ϕ →(π/2).
(iv) Show that the component of the acceleration directed towards the centre of the sphere
has magnitude (1/R), independent of ϕ. Explain this geometrically.
2. Geodesic Curvature on the Cone. Reconsider the cone of semivertical angle α shown in
[14.3], page 145. Suppose a particle travels at unit speed along a horizontal circle of radius
r on this cone.
(i) What is the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of the particle?
(ii) Sketch the projection of this acceleration onto the tangent plane of the cone, and deduce
that the geodesic curvature is κg = sin α
r
.
(iii) Let s be the distance within the cone (along a geodesic generator) from the vertex to
the circle. Cut the cone along a generator and press it ﬂat onto the plane, as in [14.3],
page 145, so that the circle becomes an arc of a circle in the plane of radius s and there-
fore of curvature (1/s) within the plane. Verify that this curvature is the same as κg.
(NOTE: What is the radius of this circle from the intrinsic point of view? Well, if two ants
at neighbouring points of the circle start walking inward along radii—along geodesic
generators orthogonal to the circle—they will meet at the vertex, so the intrinsic radius is
simply the distance s from the vertex to the circle. The natural intrinsic deﬁnition of the
curvature of the circle is therefore, once again, (1/s).)
(iv) Let ρ be the distance along the normal from the particle to the axis of symmetry. Show
that the component of the acceleration along the normal is (1/ρ), and explain this geo-
metrically.
3. Geodesic Curvature along Touching Surfaces. Suppose that two surfaces touch along a
common curve C.
(i) If C is a geodesic of one surface, explain geometrically why it must also be a geodesic of
the other surface.
(ii) If C has geodesic curvature κg for one surface, explain geometrically why it must also
have geodesic curvature κg for the other surface.

(iii) Deduce (i) as a special case of (ii).
(iv) Use the formulas for κg in the previous two exercises to conﬁrm (ii) in the case that one
surface is a sphere, and the other surface is a cone, and C is a circle of latitude on the
sphere.
Intrinsic Constructions
4. Geodesic Curvature via Intrinsic Differentiation. Let v be the velocity of a particle travel-
ling at unit speed along a trajectory K over the surface S of some peelable fruit. If o is the
launch point, let (e1, e2) be an orthonormal basis for To. Now parallel transport e1 along K,
and let θ|| denote the angle between this parallel-transported e1 and v.
(i) Explain why e2 is automatically parallel-transported along K, too:
Dve1 = 0
=⇒
Dve2 = 0.
(ii) Let v⊥be the unit vector obtained by rotating v by (π/2) within Tp. Write v and v⊥in
terms of (e1, e2). Now use calculation to prove that
κg = Dvv =

Dvθ||

v⊥,
thereby proving (23.4): |κg| = |Dvθ|||.
(iii) Draw a sketch illustrating v, (e1, e2), and θ|| at several points along K, after the narrow
strip of peel surrounding K has been removed from S and pressed ﬂat onto the plane.
(iv) Deduce that the geodesic curvature of K is indeed the ordinary curvature of the plane
curve obtained by ﬂattening the narrow strip surrounding K.
Holonomy
5. Holonomy on Cone and Sphere.
(i) Reconsider the cone of the semivertical angle α shown in [14.3], page 145. There we
showed that if the tip of the cone is blunted, its spherical image allows us assign a deﬁnite
curvature K to the tip of the otherwise intrinsically ﬂat cone, given by (14.2):
K(spike) = β = split angle of ﬂattened spike = 2π(1 −sin α).
By carrying out parallel transport within the ﬂattened cone in [14.3], show that holonomy
assigns the same total curvature to the spike.
(ii) On S2, let us use extrinsic, potato-peeler parallel transport to ﬁnd the holonomy of a
circle of latitude of ﬁxed angle ϕ. Imagine a cone of semivertical angle α resting on the
sphere so that it touches the sphere along this circle. The strip of peel of the sphere along
this circle is therefore (ultimately) the same as the strip of the touching cone. Show that
α = π
2 −ϕ, and use (i) to conﬁrm that the total curvature within the polar cap is indeed
the holonomy of the circle of latitude that bounds it.
(iii) On the equator of S2, imagine a vector pointing due east. Now parallel transport it due
east along the geodesic equator, so that it returns home seemingly unchanged, i.e., with
vanishing holonomy. But this loop encloses half the sphere, with total curvature 2π! Use
(ii) to reconcile these facts, by gradually increasing ϕ from 0 to (π/2).

Curvature as a Force between Neighbouring Geodesics
7. Minding’s Theorem. Using the same geodesic polar coordinates as in Section 28.3, the metric
takes the form
ds2 = dr2 + g2(r) dθ2,
so that
g′′ = −Kg.
Using the fact that g(r) ≍r (as r vanishes), solve this differential equation in each of the three
cases of constant K:
(i) If K = 0 everywhere, deduce that the surface is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane.
(ii) If K = (1/R2) is constant throughout the surface, deduce that the space is locally isometric
to the sphere of radius R.
(iii) If K = −(1/R2) is constant throughout the surface, deduce that the space is locally
isometric to the pseudosphere of radius R.
8. Jacobi Equation on a General Surface of Revolution. As in Exercise 22, page 89, imagine a
particle travelling along a curve in the (x, y)-plane at unit speed, and let its position at time t
be [x(t), y(t)]. Now imagine rotating this plane through angle θ about the x-axis. As θ varies
from 0 to 2π, the curve sweeps out a surface of revolution.
(i) Explain why.x

from the Jacobi Equation (28.2) that K = −..y/y. (Recall that this is the same formula (13.4)

that we previously obtained in the course of proving the Theorema Egregium for surfaces
of revolution.)
9. Gauss’s Lemma via Computation. As in [28.6], consider two neighbouring, unit-speed
geodesics launched from o with angular separation δθ, and let v denote their unit velocity
vectors. Let ξ be the connecting vector between the geodesics, connecting two points at the
same distance σ = t from o, so that both lie on the geodesic circle K(σ). Then, as δθ →0, ξ
is tangent to K(σ). To establish Gauss’s Lemma, (28.4), we must therefore show that v·ξ = 0.
(NOTE: In the following, ∇v is the ordinary R3 derivative, not the intrinsic surface derivative,
Dv = ∇v.)
(i) Explain why limσ→0 v·ξ = 0.
(ii) Deduce that to prove v·ξ = 0, it sufﬁces to show that ∇v

v·ξ

= 0.
(iii) Explain why v·∇ξv = 0.
(iv) Explain why [v, ξ] = 0.

(vi) Combine the three previous results to prove that
∇v

thereby completing the computational proof of Gauss’s Lemma.
Riemann’s Curvature
10. Two Symmetries of the Riemann Tensor.
(i) Let us conﬁrm the First (Algebraic) Bianchi Identity, (29.15), which is also called the
Bianchi Symmetry:
R(u, v) w + R(v, w) u + R(w, u) v = 0
⇐⇒
Rijkm + Rjkim + Rkijm = 0.
To prove the general result it actually sufﬁces (by virtue of linearity) to prove it in the case
that all three vector ﬁelds are coordinate vector ﬁelds, in which case their commutators
all vanish. Prove that in this case,
R(u, v) w + R(v, w) u + R(w, u) v = ∇u[v, w] + ∇v[w, u] + ∇w[u, v] = 0.
A more elegant proof using curvature 2-forms can be found in Section 38.12.4.
(ii) With the same commuting vector ﬁelds as in (i), we can give a geometrical explanation
of the Bianchi Symmetry, as follows. (NOTE: I certainly do not believe I am the ﬁrst to
discover this proof, but I have not been able to ﬁnd it in print, and therefore do not know
to whom credit should be assigned.) Starting at some point, draw ϵu, ϵv, ϵw, where ϵ
is small and ultimately vanishing. Begin to construct a polyhedral “box” by completing
each pair of these edges, creating three parallelogram faces, which are closed by virtue
of their vanishing commutators. Now construct (and sketch) two new vector edges A
and B of this box, obtained by parallel transporting ϵw ﬁrst along ϵv and then along
ϵu (yielding A), and, in the reverse order, ﬁrst along ϵu and then along ϵv (yielding B).
Next connect the end of B to the end of A, thereby creating a new vector edge of a new
triangular face of the box. Deduce that this new edge is given by,
A −B ≍ϵ3 R(u, v) w.

338
•
Chapter 31 Exercises for Act IV
Repeat this construction using the other two faces, thereby constructing two more trian-
gular faces of the box. Your ﬁgure should now reveal that ϵ3 R(u, v) w, ϵ3 R(v, w) u, and
ϵ3 R(w, u) v form the vector edges of a fourth triangular face that closes the box, thereby
proving the Bianchi Symmetry.
(iii) Let us conﬁrm that the Riemann tensor is symmetric under interchange of the ﬁrst and second
pairs of vectors, (29.16):
[R(u, v) x]· y = [R(x, y) u]· v
⇐⇒
Rijkl = Rklij.
As of this writing, I have failed to make geometrical sense of this result, so we must now
resort to proving it by means of Satanic (see Prologue) Algebra. If we deﬁne
B(u, v, x, y) ≡[R(u, v) x]· y + [R(v, x) u]· y + [R(x, u) v]· y,
then
B(u, v, x, y) = 0,
by virtue of the Bianchi Symmetry in (i). Recalling that the Riemann tensor is anti-
symmetric in both the ﬁrst two slots and in the second two slots, prove the result by
cancelling like terms from the following (manifestly trivial!) identity:
B(u, v, x, y) + B(v, x, y, u) = 0 = B(x, y, u, v) + B(y, u, v, x).
(Can you smell the sulphur?)
11. Counting the Components of the Riemann Tensor. (The following proof, which we found
in Lightman et al. (1975), is shorter and simpler than other standard proofs we have seen.)
(i) Given that the components Rijkl of the Riemann tensor in an n-manifold are antisym-
metric in ij and kl, deduce that there are P = 1
2n(n −1) nontrivial ways of choosing pairs
ij, and likewise P ways of choosing pairs kl.
(ii) Given the symmetry (29.16) under interchange of the ﬁrst and second pair of indices,
Rijkl = Rklij (see previous exercise), deduce that if we only take these pair symmetries
into account, there are 1
2P(P + 1) independent ways of choosing ijkl.
(iii) Deﬁning Bijkl ≡Rijkl + Riklj + Riljk, as in the previous exercise, the Bianchi Symme-
try (29.15) states that Bijkl = 0 (see previous exercise). Verify that the pair symmetries
now ensure that Bijkl is totally antisymmetric on all four indices, and that the constraint
Bijkl = 0 is therefore trivially satisﬁed unless all four indices are distinct.
(iv) If n < 4, the Bianchi Symmetry therefore does not impose any new constraints. Use (ii)
to deduce that if n = 2 the Riemann tensor has one component (the Gaussian curvature),
and if n = 3 it has six components.
(v) If n ⩾4, deduce that the number of additional constraints resulting from the Bianchi
symmetry is equal to the number of ways of choosing four objects from n objects.
(vi) Deduce that the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor is
1
2P(P + 1) −
n!
(n −4)! 4!,
in which the second term correctly disappears if n < 4.
(vii) Verify that this does indeed yield formula (29.1): The number of independent components of
the Riemann tensor is
1
12n2(n2 −1).

Einstein’s Curved Spacetime
13. Eclipses and the Tides. The tidal inﬂuence of the Moon on the oceans is more than twice
as great as the Sun’s, despite the fact the Sun’s gravitational pull on the Earth is about 200
times more powerful than the Moon’s. Let us try to understand this seemingly paradoxical
reversal.
(i) It is a remarkable fact that total solar eclipses occur. This is only possible because of an
empirical coincidence: the Moon and Sun look almost exactly the same (angular) size as
seen from Earth. If the radii of the Moon and Sun are rm and rs, and their distances from
Earth are Rm and Rs, respectively, deduce that (Rm/Rs) ≈(rm/rs).
(ii) We have seen that the tidal force exerted on the oceans by a body of mass M at distance
R from Earth is proportional to M
R3 . By appealing to (i), deduce that the ratio of the lunar

Chapter 31 Exercises for Act IV
14. Conservation of the Einstein Tensor. (NOTE: Unless you are already familiar with tensor
contractions, and with raising/lowering tensor indices, it would be best to defer this exer-
cise until you have studied the relevant sections of Act V, namely, 33.7 and 33.8.) Recall from
(30.21) that the Einstein tensor G is
G ≡Ricci −1
2R g.
This exercise demonstrates that the Einstein tensor is “conserved,” in the same way that
energy–momentum is conserved:
∇aGab = 0.
This crucial, purely mathematical fact was unknown to Einstein when he wrote down his
ﬁeld equation, (30.19), on the 25th of November, 1915 (Einstein’s original form being
mathematically equivalent of the modern form, G = 8π T). Subsequently, it was recognized
that the link that Einstein had discovered between geometry and matter actually implies that
energy–momentum must be conserved: ∇aTab = 0 !
(i) Check that the Second (Differential) Bianchi Identity, (29.17), can be written

(ii) Now perform two contractions of this equation, by (1) raising a and renaming d to a, so
that the two a’s are summed over; (2) renaming e to c, so that the two c’s are summed
over. Conﬁrm that this yields

(v) Deduce that ∇aGab = 0, as was to be shown.
15. Weyl Curvature. The 20 components of the Riemann tensor in spacetime can be split between
the 10 components of the Ricci tensor (generated by matter and energy, via the Einstein
ﬁeld equation) and the 10 components that represent pure gravitational degrees of freedom,
present in vacuum. These gravitational degrees of freedom are completely encoded by the
Weyl curvature tensor:

(ii) Deduce from (i) that the Weyl tensor has the same symmetries as the full Riemann tensor.
(iii) Verify that the Einstein Field Equation immediately implies that, in vacuum, the Weyl

(iv) Show that all the traces of the Weyl tensor vanish: in particular,

Thus the equivalent of the Ricci tensor—the matter–energy part of the Riemann tensor—
vanishes for the Weyl tensor.
(v) (NOTE: The remainder of this exercise is more advanced, and really requires more than
we have explained thus far. The solution can be found in the references cited at the
conclusion of this exercise.) Suppose we subject the spacetime metric to a conformal
transformation:
g −→Ω2 g,
where Ωis a function that varies from point to point throughout spacetime. But, at each
point, all local distances are stretched by the same factor Ω, evaluated at that point. Such
a transformation preserves angles, and also preserves the shapes of small objects. The
Riemann tensor transforms in an extremely complex manner under such a conformal
transformation. However, prove that the Weyl tensor—the purely gravitational/vacuum
part—enjoys the remarkable and vitally important property that it merely scales:
Cijkl −→Ω2 Cijkl.
(vi) If we raise one index, show that we may rephrase this as saying that C

NOTE: The most natural and elegant expression of the Weyl tensor is in terms of Penrose’s
2-spinor formalism, where it takes the form of the Weyl conformal spinor ΨABCD, which is
totally symmetric and conformally invariant:
ΨABCD = Ψ(ABCD) −→ΨABCD.
ΨABCD is also called, simply, the gravitational spinor. See Penrose and Rindler (1984, §4.6,
§6.8) or Wald (1984, §13.2). For an intuitive discussion of Weyl curvature, and Penrose’s con-
jecture on its vital importance in characterizing the extraordinarily special nature of the Big
Bang, see Penrose (2005, §19.7, §28.8).

Chapter 32
1-Forms
32.1
Introduction
Act V represents cathartic release from four successive Acts of relentlessly strict geometrical rule.
As the Prologue foretold, our purpose now shall be to build the “Devil’s machine,” and to
make it available to undergraduate students. We are speaking of a seductively powerful and elegant
method of computation whose full name is The Exterior Calculus of Differential Forms, which we
have abbreviated here to Forms.
[32.1] Élie Cartan (1869–1951).
Forms were discovered by the extra-
ordinarily profound, original, and wide-
ranging Élie Cartan (pictured in [32.1])
around 1900, more than a century ago, but
it took even Cartan another 40 years to
harness the full power of his discovery.
Our aim in Act V is to confront—
succinctly, and in the plainest of Anglo-
Saxon—a century-long scandal, namely,
that the vast majority of undergraduates
(in both mathematics and physics) will
obtain their degrees without ever having
glimpsed Cartan’s Forms.
Although our principal purpose is to
develop a novel method of computation, we
desire to have our cake and eat it, too. That
is, we shall endeavour to shed as much
geometrical light as possible upon Cartan’s
Forms—much more so than in standard1
treatments, which frequently careen into a
perversely formal, shockingly abstract par-
allel Universe, in which Forms have been
stripped of all vestiges of meaning!
Instead, our approach will be brutally
concrete and vivid—occasionally down-
right lurid. We shall hold up Cartan’s (Platonic!) Forms directly before your eyes, light gleaming
upon their facets; we shall place them in your hands, so that you may feel their intricate shape
and satisfying heft; ﬁnally, you will bear witness to their fearsome power.
1Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) and Schutz (1980) are two superb exceptions, and we strongly recommend both of them
as companion (or follow-up) reading for Act V. Other noteworthy efforts can found in the Further Reading section at the end
of this book.

Chapter 32 1-Forms
But heed the warning that heralded the Prologue: do not be blinded by this power! Put this
diabolical machine to work in the service of geometry, not in place of it!
—Here endeth the lesson. Amen!—
While the applications of Cartan’s Forms are legion, our primary application (in the ﬁnal
chapter of Act V) will naturally be to Differential Geometry, enabling us to reprove by symbolic
means results that were proved geometrically in the ﬁrst four Acts.
First, however, we shall fully develop Cartan’s ideas in their own right, providing a self-contained
introduction to Forms that is completely independent of the ﬁrst four Acts. We have done this because
Forms ﬁnd fruitful applications across diverse areas of mathematics, physics, and other disci-
plines. In short, our aim is to make Forms accessible to the widest possible range of readers, even if their
primary interest is not Differential Geometry.
32.2
Deﬁnition of a 1-Form
The starting point, and the fundamental building block of Cartan’s diabolically ingenious
machine, is the concept of a 1-form. Let us waste no time in stating its deﬁnition:
A 1-form is a linear, real-valued function of a single vector input.
NOTES: The “1-” refers to the single vector input; later we will meet 2-forms that take two vectors
as their input, 3-forms that take three vectors as their input, and so on. A 1-form is therefore an
especially simple kind of tensor. Older works instead call this concept a covariant vector, or a
covector.2 We will denote 1-forms by lowercase bold Greek letters, while continuing to denote
vectors by lowercase bold Roman letters.
More explicitly, if k1 and k2 are arbitrary constants, and v1 and v2 are arbitrary vectors, then
ω is a 1-form
⇐⇒
ω(k1v1 + k2v2) = k1 ω(v1) + k2 ω(v2).
(32.1)
When checking that a particular ω is a 1-form, it can be conceptually helpful to break down
this single requirement into two simpler ones:
ω(v1 + v2) = ω(v1) + ω(v2),
(32.2)
and
ω(kv) = k ω(v).
(32.3)
Check for yourself that (32.2) and (32.3) together imply (32.1), and vice versa: the two deﬁnitions
of linearity are equivalent.
2This terminology is explained in Exercise 3.

32.3 Examples of 1-Forms
•
347
A 1-form is deﬁned by its action on vectors: two 1-forms are equal if and only if they have the
same effect on all vectors. Given two distinct 1-forms, ω and φ, there is therefore a natural way to
deﬁne their sum, (ω + φ), by its action on a general vector v:
(ω + φ)(v) ≡ω(v) + φ(v),
and it is easy to check [exercise] using (32.2) and (32.3) that this sum is itself a 1-form. Likewise,
we may multiply a 1-form ω by a constant k to obtain a new 1-form,

kω

, deﬁned by

kω

(v) ≡k

ω(v)

.
Thus the set of 1-forms is closed under addition and multiplication by constants, and therefore
constitutes what is called a vector space. This vector space of 1-forms is said to be dual to the
space of vectors upon which it acts. The reason for this terminology is that there is a symmetrical
relationship between these two spaces: we can also think of the space of vectors as “dual” to the
space of 1-forms.
To see this symmetry, let us think of a vector v as a function that acts on 1-forms ω, this action
being deﬁned by
v(ω) ≡ω(v).
This symmetrical action of a vector and a 1-form upon each other is often called the contraction
of one with the other, and is sometimes denoted3 ⟨ω, v⟩, to emphasize the equal footing of the two
kinds of object.
It follows from this that a vector v is a linear function of 1-forms:
v(ω + φ)
=
(ω + φ)(v)
=
ω(v) + φ(v)
=
v(ω) + v(φ),
and,
v(k ω) = k ω(v) = k v(ω).
Just as Tp denotes the space of vectors at the point p, so T∗p denotes the dual vector space of
1-forms at p. And just as a vector ﬁeld assigns a vector vp to each point p, so a ﬁeld of 1-forms
assigns a 1-form ωp to each point p.
The next section justiﬁes the introduction of 1-forms (albeit after the fact!) by revealing a
secret: you have spent your adult life surrounded by 1-forms—you just didn’t know it.

Gravitational Work
Let F be the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on a unit mass near the surface of the
Earth. We shall make the approximation that F is constant if we only move the mass short dis-
tances. If we lift the mass through a vertical distance h, then the work done—i.e., the energy we
must expend to make this happen—is ω = Fh.
3The similarity to the Dirac bra–ket notation is not coincidental, as we shall see in a moment.

[32.2] [a] When the mass is moved along v = (v1 + v2), the increase h in its height is simply the sum (h1 + h2)
of the separate increases in height resulting from moving along v1 and v2, separately. [b] Stretching the movement
v by a factor of k also stretches the vertical movement by the same factor.
Now suppose that we move the mass along the vector v, and deﬁne
ω(v) ≡work done moving the mass along v.
Then ω is a 1-form!
To verify this, we must check (32.2) and (32.3). As illustrated in [32.2a], when the mass is
moved along v = (v1 + v2), the increase h in its height is simply the sum (h1 + h2) of the separate
increases in height resulting from moving along v1 and v2, separately. Likewise, as illustrated in
[32.2b], stretching the movement v by a factor of k also stretches the vertical movement (and hence
the work) by the same factor. Done!
32.3.2
Visualizing the Gravitational Work 1-Form
This example naturally suggests a means of visualizing a 1-form. Imagine a family of equally
spaced surfaces of constant height. These are spheres centred at the centre of the Earth, but, in
the local vicinity of the mass, these spheres will look like a stack of equally spaced horizontal
planes. See the right-hand side of [32.3].
As we move the mass along v, the change in height, and hence the work, will be proportional
to the number of planes pierced by v. By adjusting the spacing of the surfaces/planes to be (1/F),
we can therefore make
ω(v) = number of surfaces of ω pierced by v.
Of course, in general, the tip of v will lie between two planes, but we can easily imagine ﬁlling the
space between two planes with interpolating planes, so that if, for example, the tip of v lies half
way between plane 17 and plane 18, we can say that it pierces 17.5 planes.
Thus the 1-form ω itself may be visualized as this stack of equally spaced surfaces of constant
gravitational potential energy, and the greater the force F represented by ω, the more densely packed the
surfaces of ω.

[32.3] Visualization of a 1-Form. On the right is the stack representing the gravitational work 1-form ω, its planes
being (1/F) apart, and its direction upward. Thus ω(v) can be visualized as the (signed) number of planes
pierced by v. On the left is the unit-spaced 1-form φ. When this is multiplied by F, the density of its planes is
increased by F, shrinking their spacing to (1/F), yielding φ · F = ω.
To drive home this point, [32.3] shows a 1-form φ (on the left) with unit spacing being
multiplied by F to yield our work 1-form, φ · F = ω, on the right.
Note that this visualization of the contraction of a vector with a 1-form has the virtue of very
clearly putting the two kinds of objects on an equal footing. We call the set of equally spaced
parallel planes a stack. Note that in order to complete interpretation in [32.3], we must attach a
direction (variously known as a sense or an orientation) to the stack, upward in our case, as illus-
trated. If the direction of v agrees with the direction of ω, then the piercings are counted as positive,
but if the vector goes against the direction of the stack, then the piercings are counted as negative.
This visualization can be applied more generally to an arbitrary 1-form. At the point p, the
representative surface S of ω is deﬁned by the fact that vectors emanating from p tangent to S
satisfy ω(v) = 0, corresponding to zero surfaces being pierced. To put this into the language of
Linear Algebra, the set of tangent vectors to S satisfy ω(v) = 0, so they comprise the kernel of ω.
In general, it is only possible to represent a 1-form ﬁeld in this way as a stack of planes at
a point—typically the small pieces of planes at neighbouring points will fail to mesh together to
create a smooth family of space-ﬁlling surfaces, called a foliation, although they do happen to in
our gravitational example. For a discussion of this point, see Penrose (2005, §12.3), Bachman (2012,
§5.7), or Dray (2015, §13.8).
In R3, the set of vectors satisfying ω(v) = 0 spans a 2-dimensional plane, but in n-dimensional
space ω will instead be represented by (n −1)-dimensional spaces.
32.3.3
Topographic Maps and the Gradient 1-Form
If you are planning a long hike through rugged, mountainous terrain, you will be well-advised
to plan your route using a topographic map, so as to avoid having to climb too hard, or to scamble
down a slope that is dangerously steep. Recall from the example, [19.6], on page 203 that such
a map shows contours of constant height h(x, y): as the point p = (x, y) in the map travels along
such a contour, h(p) = constant.
Consider the two hills and the pass depicted in [32.4], and its topographic map below. If you
hike along one of these contours, the ground is ﬂat: you neither climb nor descend. If, on the other
hand, you set off in the direction orthogonal to the contour, you will rise (or descend) as rapidly
as possible: the direction orthogonal to a contour is the direction of steepest ascent/descent. The contours

[32.4] Topographic Map and the Gradient 1-Form. As we zoom in on a small region surrounding a point p in
the topographic map of a surface, the contours look straighter and straighter, and more and more evenly spaced.
Ultimately they become the representatives of the topographic map of the tangent plane Tp to the surface at the
point directly above p, the latter map being a depiction of the gradient 1-form ζ.
are drawn with equal increments δh in the height h, so if you walk in the direction orthogonal to
a contour, the more crowded together the contours in the map, the steeper the terrain.
In greater detail, suppose we draw lots of contours with a ﬁxed, small difference δh between
one and the next. In the immediate vicinity of the point p, the density of the contours is roughly
constant; let’s call this roughly constant horizontal distance between neighbouring contours in the
map δr. Then the slope of terrain in that small region is
slope ≍δh
δr .
In other words, the steepness of the terrain is inversely proportional to the gap between neighbouring
contours in the map.
This is very reminiscent of our visualization of the gravitational work 1-form: the stronger the
gravitational force, the denser the packing of the surfaces representing the corresponding work
1-form. With this in mind, let us attempt to explicitly identify a steepness 1-form associated with
our topographic map.
In the map plane, let v = −→
ab be a vector emanating from a, with its tip at b, as illustrated.
Suppose we attempt to deﬁne a steepness 1-form as follows:
η(v)
≡
(number of contours pierced by v) · (δh)
=
h(b) −h(a)
=
change in elevation from tail to tip of v.
Does this satisfy the linearity conditions, (32.2) and (32.3)?

32.3 Examples of 1-Forms
•
351
Let v1 = −→
al, v2 = −→
lb, and v = v1 + v2, as illustrated; then, at ﬁrst glance, it might appear that all
goes well:
η(v1) + η(v2) = [h(l) −h(a)] + [h(b) −h(l)] = h(b) −h(a) = η(v).
However, unlike a true 1-form, the value of η(v) depends on where the vector v is drawn: if we
imagine v2 drawn at a instead of at l, then clearly (32.2) is no longer satisﬁed! Thus our putative
1-form η at p has not actually passed the ﬁrst test. Furthermore, even if we restrict ourselves to
vectors emanating from a, it fails the second test, too, for it is clear that if we double the length of
the illustrated vector v then we end up on the far side of the hill, and the altitude actually decreases,
instead of doubling, as it should. Thus η does not satisfy (32.3).
Nevertheless, this discussion points the way to a genuine 1-form. The smaller the region sur-
rounding a point p that we examine, the more precisely uniform the pattern of contours: they look
like evenly spaced, parallel lines. Thus if we only apply η to very short (ultimately vanishing) vectors
emanating from p, then η does (ultimately) satisfy the linearity requirements!
Now let us try to extend this local action of η at p from tiny vectors emanating from p to
large vectors, drawn anywhere in the map plane. All we need to do is to take this local pattern of

[32.5] The Gradient 1-Form ζp of the height of a

at the point directly above the point p.
parallel, equally spaced lines in the immedi-
ate vicinity of p (all parallel to the tangent line
to the contour through p) and extend it out
to cover the entire plane. If we look thought-
fully at [32.4], we see that what we have just
constructed is in fact the topographic map of the
tangent plane Tp to the surface at the point directly
above p!
In order to obtain a genuine 1-form ﬁeld
ζ, we need only apply our old deﬁnition of η to
this topographic map of Tp. See [32.5]. We repeat
that this topographic map consists of equally
spaced parallel lines, all running in the same
direction as the original contour through p,
and the gap between one line and the next is δr ≍
(δh)/(slope of Tp) : the bigger the slope of Tp,
the more densely packed the parallel lines in
its topographic map. The direction orthogonal
to these lines is the direction of steepest ascent
up the surface at the point p.
The value ζp of the 1-form ﬁeld ζ at p is the 1-form that is deﬁned by the tangent plane Tp at
the point of the surface directly above p. As illustrated in [32.5],
ζp(v)
≡
(number of lines pierced by v) · (δh)
=
change in height of Tp from tail to tip of v.
(32.4)
As p varies, the direction and spacing of the original contour lines around p both vary,
reﬂecting the fact that the tangent plane Tp to the surface is varying, and so we have a different
topographic map of Tp at each point, and hence a different value ζp of the 1-form ﬁeld ζ.
If we apply ζp to very short (ultimately vanishing) vectors emanating from p, then its effect
is ultimately equal to that of η; that is, ζp(v) ≍ηp(v). But as the vector gets bigger, η(v) tells us
the nonlinear variation in the height of the actual terrain/surface, while the 1-form ζp(v) tells us
the perfectly linear variation in the height of the tangent plane to the surface at that point.
This 1-form ﬁeld ζ is called the gradient of h. You are probably asking yourself if this is con-
nected with the familiar, eponymous concept from Vector Calculus. Indeed it is! The explanation

352
•
Chapter 32 1-Forms
of the connection is the subject of Section 32.6. This idea of the gradient 1-form ﬁeld ζ is extremely
important, and we shall see how it can be generalized to functions h that depend on more than
two variables, which therefore cannot be so simply visualized as the height z = h(x, y) of a surface
about the (x, y)-plane.
32.3.4
Row Vectors
Consider a speciﬁc 2-dimensional row vector, such as ω = [−3, 2]. We can deﬁne the action of ω on
2-dimensional column vectors v =
"
x
y
#
by means of standard matrix multiplication on the left:
ω(v) = [−3, 2]
"
x
y
#
= −3x + 2y.
We leave it to you to check that this does indeed satisfy (32.2) and (32.3). Thus, viewed in this way,
row vectors are 1-forms.
We can relate this example to the gravitational work example. To do so, let us choose Cartesian
coordinates (x, y, z) with the z-axis vertical, in the direction of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. Then
we can represent the gravitational work as the 1-form (i.e., row vector),
ω = [0, 0, F],

Dirac’s Bras
NOTE: This example assumes that you are already familiar with quantum mechanics; feel free to
skip it if you are not.
Although we have deﬁned 1-forms to be real-valued, and shall continue to do so—with one
exception—for the remainder of the book, it is often useful to broaden the deﬁnition to include
complex-valued 1-forms. Indeed, this generalization arises naturally in quantum mechanics, and it
is essential in that context.
If we think of Dirac kets |v⟩(i.e., the quantum states) as the “vectors,” then a Dirac bra ⟨ω| is
a 1-form, provided we deﬁne the contraction of a 1-form and a vector to be the standard (complex)
bra–ket inner product:
ω(v) ≡⟨ω|v⟩.
To conﬁrm that a bra ⟨ω| is a 1-form, we simply check the deﬁnition, (32.1):
ω(k1v1 + k2v2)
=
⟨ω|k1v1 + k2v2⟩
=
k1 ⟨ω|v1⟩+ k2 ⟨ω|v2⟩
=
k1 ω(v1) + k2 ω(v2).
32.4
Basis 1-Forms
At a point p in an n-manifold, suppose that we have chosen a basis {ej} for Tp, so that a general
vector can be written, using the Einstein summation convention, as
v = vj ej.
We shall not assume that this basis is orthonormal. Given this basis, there exists a natural way to
associate with it a dual basis {ωi} for the space T∗p of 1-forms at p:

[32.6] [a] The ﬁrst basis 1-form ω1 picks out the 1st component v1 of v; likewise, the second basis 1-form ω2
picks out the second component. [b] With the same e1 as before, merely changing e2 causes both of the basis
1-forms to change.
ωi picks out the i-th component of v
⇐⇒
ωi(v) = vi.
(32.5)
These {ωi} are indeed 1-forms, which can be conﬁrmed by checking (32.2) and (32.3): the i-th
component of the sum of two vectors is the sum of their i-th components, and the i-th component
of kv is just kvi. Done!
Figure [32.6a] illustrates this deﬁnition in the case of a 2-manifold (i.e., a surface) for which
the tangent plane Tp = R2. Here, as illustrated, we have chosen a basis {e1, e2} of nonorthogonal
but unit vectors, and
v = v1 e1 + v2 e2 = ω1(v) e1 + ω2(v) e2.
Thus, in this case, ω1(v) is simply the length of the projection (parallel to e2) of v onto e1, and
correspondingly for ω2(v), as illustrated.
Let us nip the following common misconception in the bud. While the set of basis 1-forms
{ω1, ω2} is dual to the set of basis vectors {e1, e2}, it is simply wrong to think that ω1 is dual to e1,
and that ω2 is dual to e2.
Figure [32.6b] reveals the error of this thinking. Here we have illustrated the same vector v
broken down into components relative to a new basis {ee1,ee2}, in which ee1 = e1, but ee2 ̸= e2. As you
can see, even though we have only changed one basis vector, both basis 1-forms have changed!
Likewise, in the general n-dimensional case, changing a single basis vector can change the entire
dual basis of 1-forms.
We should note that our preferred deﬁnition (32.6) of the dual basis is not the conventional
one, though it is the deﬁnition used by Schutz (1980), and it is mathematically equivalent to the
standard one, as we now explain.
First recall the deﬁnition of the
Kronecker delta:
δi
j ≡
{
1
if i = j
0
if i ̸= j
}
.
It is easy to prove that our deﬁnition (32.6) is equivalent to the following, standard deﬁnition:
Equivalent deﬁnitions of a basis {ωi}:
ωi(ej) = δi
j
⇐⇒
ωi(v) = vi.

The implication from right to left is immediate, and the implication from left to right goes like this:
ωi(v) = ωi(vj ej) = vj ωi(ej) = vj δi
j = vi.
32.5
Components of a 1-Form
The ever-vigilant reader will have noticed that we have not actually proved that the set {ωi} is
a basis for the 1-forms. Rather than proving directly that they are linearly independent, we shall
follow the more elegant and enlightening approach employed by Schutz (1980, §2.20).
Let the general 1-form φ act on the general vector v:
φ(v)
=
φ(vj ej)
=
vj φ(ej)
=
ωj(v) φ(ej).
We now deﬁne the
Components φj of φ:
φj ≡φ(ej).
Thus,
φ(v) = φj ωj(v).
But since a 1-form is deﬁned by its action on a general vector, we may “abstract away” the vector
v on both sides of this equation, and thereby equate the 1-forms themselves, and, in so doing,
decompose the arbitrary 1-form φ into its unique components in the 1-form basis {ωi} dual to the
vector basis {ej}:
φ = φj ωj = φ(ej) ωj.

Review of the Gradient as a Vector: ∇f
Recall from Vector Calculus that in R2 the gradient of a function f is deﬁned to be the vector
∇f ≡
"
Bxf
Byf
#
.
The signiﬁcance of this vector is that,
∇f points in the direction of most rapid increase of f, and its magnitude |∇f|
equals that maximum rate of increase of f with distance as we move in that
direction.
(32.7)
This interpretation springs from a more primitive fact, which we now derive. Let {e1, e2} be the
standard orthonormal basis along the (x1, x2) = (x, y) axes, and let δf be the small change in f
resulting from moving along the short (ultimately vanishing) vector

By deﬁnition, Bxf is the rate of change of f as we move in the x-direction, so the change in f
resulting from moving δx is ultimately equal to (Bxf) δx; and likewise for y. Therefore,
δf ≍(Bxf) δx + (Byf) δy = (∇f)·v.

[32.7] The Gradient Vector ∇f. The
small change δf resulting from moving
along the short vector v is ultimately equal
to |∇f| (δs cos θ).
In the classical notation of the eighteenth century, this
was instead expressed as
df = (Bxf) dx + (Byf) dy,
(32.9)
in which df, dx, and dy were understood to be inﬁnites-
imals—a concept we have eschewed in this work. How-
ever, as we shall see shortly, this ancient formula takes
on a new life, with a precise and rigorous meaning,
when viewed through the modern prism of 1-forms.
In order to derive (32.8), consider [32.7], which
interprets (32.9) geometrically. If we keep the length
|v| ≡δs ﬁxed, then as v rotates around the circle,
δf ≍|∇f| (δs cos θ),
where θ is the angle that v makes with the gradient ∇f,
so that (δs cos θ) is simply the projection of v onto the
direction of ∇f, as illustated.
Let bv = v/|v| denote the unit vector in the direction
of v. Then the above result can instead be expressed as
∇bvf
 = df
ds = |∇f| cos θ.
This immediately conﬁrms the interpretation of ∇f given in (32.8). It also shows that if we move
in the direction orthogonal to ∇f, then the rate of change of f vanishes. This is the direction of the
tangent to the curve deﬁned by f = constant.
In R3 the analysis is exactly as before, but now there is an entire plane of directions orthogonal
to ∇f: this is the tangent plane to the surface, f = constant.
32.6.2
The Gradient as a 1-Form: df
Although we are accustomed to thinking of the gradient as a vector, it is in fact more naturally a
1-form. Let us immediately deﬁne this 1-form, and then proceed to make sense of it.
The gradient 1-form df of a function f is deﬁned by its action on vectors:
df(v) ≡∇vf.
(32.10)
The bold d operator is called the exterior derivative; it will play a central role in what follows.

•
Chapter 32 1-Forms
Let us check that df really is a 1-form, by verifying (32.2) and (32.3):
(df) (v1 + v2) = ∇v1 + v2f = ∇v1f + ∇v2f = df(v1) + df(v2)
and,
(df) (kv) = ∇kvf = k ∇vf = k df(v).
Observe that since ∇v obeys the Leibniz Rule (aka Product Rule), so does the exterior
derivative:
d(fg) = f dg + g df.

[32.8] The Cartesian Basis 1-form dx. When app-
lied to a vector v, the 1-form dx picks out the
x-component: dx(v) = v1.
What is the meaning of 1-forms dx = dx1 and
dy = dx2 in R2? To answer this question, we
must determine their effect on a general vector,
v =
"
v1
v2
#
. The deﬁnition (32.11) tells us that
(dx)

v1

=
∇v1e1+v2e2 x
=
(v1 ∇e1 + v2∇e2) x
=
(v1 Bx + v2 By) x
=
v1.
In other words, dx is the 1-form that picks
out the x-component of a vector. Likewise, we see
that (dy)v = v2. But according to the deﬁnition
(32.6), this means that {dx, dy} is the dual basis of
{e1, e2}. Equivalently, (dxi)ej = δi
j.
Geometrically, dx may be pictured as the family of unit-spaced lines perpendicular to the x-
axis, and (dx)v is the number of these lines that v pierces. The above reasoning applies equally
well to R3, in which case dx is the family of unit-spaced planes perpendicular to the x-axis, as
illustrated in [32.8].
Clearly, all of this immediately generalizes to any number of dimensions. Let {ei} be an
orthonormal basis for Rn, with Cartesian coordinates {xj}, so that v = vi ei is a general vector.
Then dxj picks out the j-th component of the vector, i.e., (dxj) v = vj. In particular,
(dxi)ej = δi
j.
(32.12)
We call this the Cartesian basis:
{dxj} = {ωj}is the Cartesian basis of 1-forms dual to {ej}.

32.7 Adding 1-Forms Geometrically
•
357
It follows from (32.7) that a general 1-form φ can be decomposed into components in this
dual basis as
φ = φj ωj = φ(ej) dxj.
(32.13)
32.6.4
The 1-Form Interpretation of df = (Bxf) dx + (Byf) dy
Taking φ = df in (32.14), we have come full circle, decomposing the gradient 1-form df of a general
function f into its Cartesian basis 1-form components, as follows:
df =

(df) ej

dxj =

Bxjf

dxj.
(32.14)
On a formal level, this is identical to the classical formula (32.10), but now it has a precise,
rigorous meaning that does not call upon inﬁnitesimals. And yet it is very directly and intuitively
connected to the geometrically meaningful ultimate equality, (32.9), illustrated in [32.7].
To see this, once again think of v as a short, ultimately vanishing vector,
v = δx1 e1 + δx2 e2 =
"
δx
δy
#
.
Then,
df(v) =
{
Bxf

dx + Byf

dy
}
"
δx
δy
#
= (Bxf) δx + (Byf) δy ≍δf,
which is exactly (32.9). Thus the 1-form df gives us the best of both worlds!
The above analysis sought to connect the new 1-form df to your prior knowledge of the vector
gradient ∇f. However, if you look back at our discussion of topographic maps, you will see that
we had already arrived there at this new 1-form by geometrical reasoning alone.
Indeed, if you look at our deﬁnition (32.5) (illustrated in [32.5]) of the 1-form ζ associated
with a topographic map, which describes how the height of the tangent plane varies as we move
off in an arbitrary direction, you will see that it is indeed the gradient of the height function h:
ζ = dh.
In particular, if v is the direction at p of the contour of constant height passing through that point,
then ζ(v) = dh(v) = 0, as it should.
32.7
Adding 1-Forms Geometrically
We already know the geometric meaning of multiplying a 1-form by a constant k: it compresses the
stack by k. But what does addition of 1-forms mean?
Figure [32.9] superimposes the stacks representing the 1-forms 2dx and dy, then joins the
resulting intersection points to create a new stack. This is the geometrical construction of their
sum, φ = 2dx + dy!

[32.9] Geometric Addition of 1-Forms. To add the 1-forms 2 dx
and dy, superimpose their stacks, then join their intersection
points to create the stack of φ = 2dx + dy.
We will offer three proofs, not
because the result is especially impor-
tant, but simply as valuable practice
with thinking about and manipulat-
ing 1-forms.
First note [exercise] that the unit
vector normal to eφ is
bn = 1
√

Also note that this serves to spec-
ify the direction of the stack, which
[exercise] must have positive com-
ponents along both of the stacks that
are being added.
If v =
"
a
b
#
denotes a general
vector, then its projection onto the
direction of bn is v·bn, as illustrated. But [exercise] the spacing of eφ is 1/
√
5, and so the number
of lines of the stack eφ pierced by v is
eφ(v) = number of lines pierced =
v·bn
(1/
√
5)
= 2a + b = (2dx + dy)
"
a
b
#
= φ(v).
Since v is a general vector, we may abstract it away, conﬁrming our claim that eφ = φ.
Here is a second proof, which is simpler, but less direct. We know that for any 1-form, such as
our φ, the direction(s) s lying within the stack are the kernel of the 1-form: s does not pierce any
lines (or planes, in R3) of the stack, so
0 = φ(s) = (2dx + dy)
"
p
q
#

=⇒
s ∝

#
,
but, as illustrated, this is also the direction of the eφ stack, connecting grid points. Thus the two
stacks are parallel and can only differ as regards their spacing. Put algebraically, the two 1-forms
must be proportional: eφ = K φ, for some constant K. But if we apply this equation to a speciﬁc vector
for which the number of pierced lines is evident—try
"
0
1
#
—then we instantly deduce that K = 1.
Done!
The third proof is perhaps the simplest of all. In [32.9], think of v =
"
x
y
#
as being a position
vector, emanating from a ﬁxed origin. What is the equation of a line in the φ-stack? Well, as the tip
of v moves along such a line, v pierces a ﬁxed number of stack lines, so
constant = φ(v) = (2dx + dy)

y = −2x + constant.

But these lines, with slope −2, are parallel to the eφ-stack. The rest of the proof is the same as
before.
It is easy [exercise] to generalize these arguments to conﬁrm that this geometrical construction

Tensors
33.1
Deﬁnition of a Tensor: Valence
In our discussion of the Riemann tensor, we tentatively deﬁned a tensor as a multilinear function
of multiple vector inputs. This was the best we could do at the time, because we lacked the concept
of a 1-form. But a fully general tensor is, in fact, a multilinear function of vectors and 1-forms, and
the valence tells us how many of each:
A tensor H of valence
{
f
v
}
at a point p is a multilinear, real-valued function
of f 1-forms, and v vectors, such that the value of H at p only depends on the
values of the 1-forms and vectors at p.
Thus a 1-form is a tensor of valence
{
0
1
}
, because it has one “slot” into which a single vector
can be fed, the output being the contraction of that vector with the 1-form. Likewise, a vector is
a tensor of valence
{
1
0
}
, because it has one slot into which a single 1-form can be fed, the output
being the contraction of that 1-form with the vector.
In the general case, we may divide the input slots of H into two groups: f slots to input the
f 1-forms, φ1, . . . , φf, and a second group of v slots to input the v vectors, v1, . . . , vv. Using ∥to
denote the boundary between these two groups, we have
H(φ1, . . . , φf ∥v1, . . . , vv).
In general, the order in which we feed 1-forms and vectors into these slots matters: if we swap a
pair of 1-forms or a pair of vectors in these slots, the output will in general be completely unrelated
to the original value.
Let us re-examine the Riemann tensor R from this new, general point of view. In (29.8) we
deﬁned this as a vector-valued, multilinear function of three vector inputs: w is the vector that
is parallel-transported around the parallelogram with edges deﬁned by u and v, which we now
imagine to be very short, and the output is the vector holonomy δw:
δw = R(u, v; w) =
{
[∇u , ∇v] −∇[u, v]
}
w.
In order to make this into a tensor in the new sense, it must output a real number, instead of the
vector δw. To extract a real number from δw, we must contract it with a 1-form. For this reason, in
place of our original deﬁnition, the standard deﬁnition of the Riemann tensor is instead a tensor of
valence
{
1
3
}
:
R(φ ∥u, v, w) ≡⟨φ, δw⟩= φ(δw).

33.2 Example: Linear Algebra
•
361
NOTE ON NOTATION: We shall reserve uppercase bold Roman letters for tensors with multiple
inputs, such as the Riemann tensor, R, the energy-momentum tensor, T, and the Einstein tensor,
G. On the other hand, some such higher-valence tensors are traditionally represented by lower-
case bold Roman letters, the most notable example being the metric tensor, g, which must not be
confused with a vector!
33.2
Example: Linear Algebra
It should already be clear that an enormous range of mathematical and physical objects fall into
our new, generalized category of tensors. To drive home this point, consider the vast and vastly
important subject of Linear Algebra. From our new vantage point, this is “merely” the study of
tensors L(φ ∥v) of valence
{
1
1
}
!
To see why this is, consider L(. . . ∥v), in which we have left the ﬁrst slot empty. In order to
yield a number, we must complete this by re-inserting the 1-form φ. Therefore, L(v) ≡L(. . . ∥v)
must be a vector, ready to be contracted with a 1-form φ to yield a number. This is perfectly anal-
ogous to our original deﬁnition of the Riemann tensor: there we had a vector-valued function
of three vectors; now we have a vector-valued function L of a single vector, which only yields a
number once we contract it with a 1-form.
But, by the deﬁnition of a tensor, L(φ ∥v) is a linear function of both φ and v. Thus,
L(k1v1 + k2v2)
=
L(... ∥k1v1 + k2v2)
=
k1 L(... ∥v1) + k2 L(... ∥v2)
=
k1 L(v1) + k2 L(v2).
Therefore L is a linear transformation, sending vectors to vectors—the fundamental object of
study in Linear Algebra! Of course, by the same token, if we leave the vector slot open, we may
instead interpret L(φ ∥. . .) as a linear, 1-form-valued function of 1-forms.
33.3
New Tensors from Old
33.3.1
Addition
Clearly it makes no sense to try to add tensors with different valences, which require entirely
different kinds of inputs. However, if the two tensors have the same valence, the deﬁnition of
addition is obvious. For example, if H and J are both of valence
{
2
1
}
, then
(H + J)(φ, ψ ∥v) ≡H(φ, ψ ∥v) + J(φ, ψ ∥v).
It is easy to check [exercise] that (H + J) is indeed another tensor of valence
{
2
1
}
.
33.3.2
Multiplication: The Tensor Product
Given two 1-forms, φ and ψ, each of which acts on a single vector, it is natural to deﬁne their
tensor product, acting on two vectors, and therefore of valence
{
0
2
}
, as follows:
(φ ⊗ψ)(v, w) ≡φ(v) ψ(w).
(33.1)
Note that order matters: φ ⊗ψ ̸= ψ ⊗φ.

362
•
Chapter 33 Tensors
TERMINOLOGY: The tensor product is also commonly called the direct product or the outer
product.
The tensor product of higher valence tensors goes the same way. For example, we may multi-
ply a tensor J(φ, ψ ∥u) of valence
{
2
1
}
and a tensor T(v, w) of valence
{
0
2
}
to obtain the tensor
J ⊗T of valence
{
2
3
}
:
(J ⊗T)(φ, ψ ∥u, v, w) ≡J(φ, ψ ∥u) · T(v, w).
Note that under tensor multiplication, valences add like vectors: in our example,
{
2
1
}
+
{
0
2
}
=
{
2
3
}
. Since multiplication by a scalar does not change the valence, the valence of a scalar must be
taken to be
{
0
0
}
.
33.4
Components
As usual, let {ei} be an orthonormal vector basis, and let {dxj} be the dual Cartesian basis of
1-forms. Just as we did to obtain the components of vectors and 1-forms, we obtain the compo-
nents of a more general tensor by ﬁlling its slots with basis 1-forms and vectors. For example, the
components of T(v, w) are
Tij = T(ei, ej)
We can decompose the full tensor T into tensor components, as follows:
T(v, w)
=
T(viei, wjej)
=
T(ei, ej) viwj
=
Tij viwj
=
Tij
h
dxi(v)
i h
dxj(w)
i
=
Tij (dxi ⊗dxj)(v, w)
But since both v and w are general vectors, we may abstract them away, to ﬁnd that the tensor
itself is
T = Tij (dxi ⊗dxj).
(33.2)
Thus we see that
The set of tensors {dxi ⊗dxj} forms a basis for tensors of valence
{
0
2
}
.
Note that if we apply this idea to (33.1), then we ﬁnd that
φ ⊗ψ = φiψj (dxi ⊗dxj).
However, such tensors are special: a general T cannot be factorized in this way.

33.5 Relation of the Metric Tensor to the Classical Line Element
•
363
We can see this from the fact that while T has n2 components Tij in n dimensions, (φ ⊗ψ) is
uniquely determined by just 2n numbers: the n components φi of φ, and the n components ψi
of ψ.
In exactly the same way, we can take the tensor product of two vectors:
(v ⊗w)(φ, ψ) = v(φ) w(ψ) = vi wj(ei ⊗ej)(φ, ψ).
And, likewise, a general tensor K(φ, ψ) of valence
{
2
0
}
can be decomposed into basis tensors as
K = Kij(ei ⊗ej).
Clearly the above technique can be applied to tensors of arbitrary valence
{
f
v
}
, decomposing
them into components using the basis tensors,
(ei1 ⊗ei1 ⊗· · · ⊗eif) ⊗(dxj1 ⊗dxj2 ⊗· · · ⊗dxjv).
Note that the components of a tensor of valence
{
f
v
}
have f upper indices, and v lower indices.1
33.5
Relation of the Metric Tensor to the
Classical Line Element
Earlier we discussed the fact that the modern gradient 1-form df is closely connected to the clas-
sical, inﬁnitesimal-based formula (33.9) for the differential df. Similarly, let us now consider how
the modern metric tensor is related to the classical, inﬁnitesimal-based line element ds of Gauss
(1827).
Gauss considered inﬁnitesimal changes du and dv in the coordinates of a point on the surface,
resulting in an inﬁnitesimal line element ds within the surface. Then, in Gauss’s original2 notation,
ds2 = E du2 + 2F du dv + G dv2.
In place of inﬁnitesimals, we instead employ ultimate equalities, expressing this as
δs2 ≍E δu2 + 2F δu δv + G δv2.
Now let
x1 = u, x2 = v
and
g11 = E, g12 = g21 = F, g22 = G.
Then, using (33.2), the metric tensor can be expressed as
g = gij(dxi ⊗dxj) = E (du ⊗du) + F (du ⊗dv) + F (dv ⊗du) + G (dv ⊗dv),
which looks tantalizingly similar to Gauss’s formula for ds2.
1In older literature, upper indices were called contravariant, and lower indices were called covariant.
2Actually, as we remarked earlier, Gauss (1827) used p and q instead of u and v.

the seemingly abstract tensor view of the subject, as the study of tensors of valence
{

? This
section uses the concepts of components, and of tensor bases, to explain the connection.
First, our tensor L(φ ∥v) has components
Lij = L(dxi ∥ej).
In order to keep things as simple as possible and as concrete as possible, we restrict ourselves to
two dimensions.
If the vector basis is represented by the column vectors
{e1, e2} =
{"
1
0
#
,
"
0

#}
,
then, as discussed in Section 32.3.4, the dual 1-form basis corresponds to row vectors:

as it should. Likewise for dx2.

Contraction
Consider the contraction of a 1-form and a vector from the point of view of components:
φ(v) = (φi dxi)(vj ej) = (φi vj) dxi(ej) = (φi vj) δi
j = φj vj.
As we know, this contraction is a geometrical operation, and the answer is independent of the
speciﬁc components of φ and v, despite the fact that these components do depend on the choice of
the dual bases {ej} and {dxi} .
Next, consider the components Li j of the tensor in the previous section. We now deﬁne,
analogously, the contraction of this tensor to be
Lj j = L(dxj ∥ej) = L1 1 + L2 2 = Tr
"
L1 1
L1 2
L2 1
L2 2
#
.
As we know from Linear Algebra, this trace is also basis-independent.3
We will prove a greatly generalized version of this basis-independence result—using purely
tensor methods, and without restricting ourselves to two dimensions—but ﬁrst we must explain
what contraction means in the general case.
The idea of contraction can be applied to any tensor whose inputs include at least one 1-form
and at least one vector: we sum over one upper index and one lower index. We have already encoun-
tered one very important and natural example of such a contraction, namely, the contraction of
the Riemann tensor that yields the Ricci tensor:
Rmijm = Rij.
Note that this contraction process changes the valence, in this example, from
{
1
3
}
to
{
0
2
}
. In
general, the input slots of the new, contracted tensor accept one fewer 1-form and one fewer vector,
thereby eliminating one upper and one lower index.
3There is a geometrical reason for this, although it is hard to ﬁnd in Linear Algebra texts. See Arnol’d (1973, §16.3).

Chapter 33 Tensors
In fact contraction has a still broader meaning in the context of tensor products. Suppose we
form A ⊗B, and then perform a summation over an upper index of A and a lower index of B. Let
us prove that the result of this contraction is another tensor, independent of the speciﬁc {ej} and
{dxi} that gave rise to the components being summed.
Following the example of Schutz (1980, §2.25), we shall communicate the idea of the proof by
means of a concrete example. Let A be of valence
{
2
0
}
, and let B be of valence
{
0
2
}
. Let us prove
that the contraction
AijBjk ≡Ci k
yields the components of a new tensor C of valence
{
1
1
}
, such that
C(φ∥v) = Ci kφi vk.
To prove this, ﬁrst observe that
Ci kφi vk
=
AijBjkφi vk
=
[φi A(dxi, dxj)] [B(ej, ek) vk]
=
A(φi dxi, dxj) B(ej, vk ek)
=
A(φ, dxj) B(ej, v).
But the B(ej, v) are numbers, and therefore the linearity of A in the second slot implies that
Ci kφi vk = A(φ, B(ej, v) dxj).
But, for ﬁxed v,
B(ej, v) dxj = B(. . . , v)
is a 1-form, requiring the insertion of a vector to produce a number. Therefore,
C(φ∥v) = A(φ, B(. . . , v))
is indeed a tensor.
33.8
Changing Valence with the Metric Tensor
We already know that the metric tensor g of valence
{
0
2
}
is the fundamental structure of a man-
ifold: it gives us the geodesics, parallel transport, and the curvature. But g also plays another
crucial role: it allows us to change the valence of a tensor. The ﬁrst step is to see how the metric allows
us to associate a particular 1-form with a particular vector, and vice versa.
If we leave one slot of g open, and insert the vector n into the other, we obtain a unique 1-form
ν corresponding to n:
vector n −→1-form ν,
where ν(w) ≡g(w, n).
(33.3)
How are the components of the 1-form ν related to the components of the original vector n?
We need only apply ν to the basis vectors. But ﬁrst . . .

33.8 Changing Valence with the Metric Tensor
•
367
NOTATIONAL WARNING: the universal convention is that the components of the 1-form correspond-
ing to the vector n are denoted ni, violating our Greek/Roman dichotomy between 1-forms and
vectors. Henceforth, the reader must therefore be more vigilant than before: if the index is up,
then it belongs to a vector, and if the index is down, it belongs to a 1-form.
With this convention in place,
ν = ni dxi.
Thus,
ni = ν(ei) = g(ei, n) = g(ei, nj ej) = g(ei, ej)nj,
so,
ni = gij nj.
(33.4)
For example, if n = nj ej is a vector in Minkowski spacetime, with metric (30.6), then [exercise] the
corresponding 1-form is
ν = ni dxi = n0 dt −n1 dx −n2 dy −n3 dz.
The metric’s ability to transform a vector into a 1-form allows us to change the valence of
any tensor. For example, consider the Riemann tensor R(ψ ∥u, v, w), of valence
{
1
3
}
, with com-
ponents Rijkm. Let us demonstrate how we may change this into a tensor of valence
{
0
4
}
, by
changing the single 1-form input into a vector input. By convention, this new tensor is still denoted
R, and its components are written Rijkl.
To evaluate the new tensor with four vector inputs, we simply replace the extra vector input
n with its corresponding 1-form ν in the original deﬁnition of the Riemann tensor:
R(u, v, w, n) ≡R(ν ∥u, v, w).
In component form, this equation becomes
Rijkluivjwknl = Rijkmuivjwknm = Rijkmuivjwk(gml nl).
Therefore,
Rijkl = Rijkm gml.
This process is called (logically enough) index lowering.
It is also possible to go in the opposite direction, changing a vector input into a 1-form input;
this results in index raising. In order to follow the same path a before, we need a mapping from
1-forms ν to vectors n. What is needed is an analogue eg of the metric tensor, now of valence
{
2
0
}
,
taking two 1-forms as input.
The mapping is then obtained exactly as before, by inserting ν into one slot, leaving the other
slot open, resulting in a vector:
1-form ν −→vector n,
where n(φ) ≡eg(φ, ν).
(33.5)

368
•
Chapter 33 Tensors
In terms of components, we will then have,
ni = egik nk.
(33.6)
And, by the same token, we can now raise any tensor index we wish, e.g.,
Rijkl egkm = R m
ij l
The ﬁnal step is to realize that eg is uniquely determined by the metric g, as follows. Lowering
and raising of indices must be inverse operations: if we lower an index and then raise it again, we
should obtain the same tensor that we started with. Put differently, changing a vector into a 1-form
with (33.3), then changing it back again with (33.5), should result in the identity. In other words, eg
is the inverse of g:
n g
−→ν
eg
−→n.
Inserting (33.4) into (33.6), this implies that
ni = egik nk = egik gkj nj.
Therefore, the components of eg must be related to the components of the metric by
egik gkj = δi
j.
(33.7)
Just as we always use the same symbol R to denote the Riemann tensor, regardless of the
number of 1-forms and vectors it accepts as inputs, so it is traditional (if confusing) to simply write
g instead of eg, and to correspondingly write its components as gik. Thus, (33.7) is conventionally
written, gik gkj = δi
j.
33.9
Symmetry and Antisymmetry
Recall the deﬁning properties of an even function, f+(x), and of an odd function, f−(x):
f+(−x) = +f+(x)
and
f−(−x) = −f−(x).
We may instead describe this by saying that f+(x) is symmetric, and f−(x) is antisymmetric.
Geometrically, the graph y = f+(x) has mirror symmetry in the y-axis, e.g., y = x2 or y = cos x,
whereas y = f−(x) does the opposite at x and its mirror image −x, e.g., y = x3 or y = sin x.
Suppose we try to split an arbitrary function f(x) (lacking any special symmetry) into the sum
of a symmetric function and an antisymmetric function:
f(x) = f+(x) + f−(x).
If this is possible, then, by deﬁnition,
f(−x) = f+(x) −f−(x).

33.9 Symmetry and Antisymmetry
•
369
By adding and then subtracting the previous two equations, we deduce that the split is always
possible, and that it is explicitly given by
f+(x) =
f(x) + f(−x)
2

and
f−(x) =
f(x) −f(−x)
2

.
For example, if we take f(x) = ex then this split naturally leads us to the hyperbolic functions:
the symmetric part of ex is f+(x) = cosh x, and the antisymmetric part is f−(x) = sinh x.
Now let us try to do something analogous with a general tensor E(v, w) of valence
{
0
2
}
.
By analogy, let the deﬁning properties of a symmetric tensor, E+, and of an antisymmetric4 tensor,
E−, be
E+(w, v) = +E+(v, w)
and
E−(w, v) = −E−(v, w).
By following the same line of reasoning as before, we discover that it is always possible to split a
general tensor of valence
{
0
2
}
into a symmetric part and an antisymmetric part:
E(v, w) = E+(v, w) + E−(v, w),
(33.8)
where
E+(v, w) =
E(v, w) + E(w, v)
2

and
E−(v, w) =
E(v, w) −E(w, v)
2

.
If we insert basis vectors into the slots, we obtain the component forms of these equations.
While we are at it, let us also introduce the following standard notation: round brackets denote
symmetrization and square brackets denote antisymmetrization:
E(ij) ≡E+
ij = 1
2 [Eij + Eji]
and
E[ij] ≡E−
ij = 1
2 [Eij −Eji]
(33.9)
Therefore,
Eij = E(ij) + E[ij].
4Also often called skew symmetric.

Deﬁnition of a 2-Form and of a p-Form
We have already encountered several vitally important tensors of valence
{
0
2
}
that are symmetric:
the metric tensor, the Ricci tensor, the energy–momentum tensor, and the Einstein tensor.
It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the secret power source of Cartan’s Forms,
which will drive our drama to its conclusion, is antisymmetry!
Let us waste no time in introducing you to the second-born of Cartan’s Forms, the ﬁrst to
appear after the 1-forms:
A 2-form Ψ is an antisymmetric tensor of valence
{
0
2
}
. That is,
Ψ(v, u) = −Ψ(u, v).
(34.1)
As a matter of simple housekeeping, let us immediately state the general deﬁnition of a
p-form, knowing full well that this will be essentially meaningless to you in the absence of concrete
examples:
A p-form (also called a differential form of degree p) is a completely antisym-
metric tensor of valence
{
0
p
}
, meaning that swapping any two of the vector
inputs reverses its sign.
Naturally, if we take p = 2 then we recover our deﬁnition (34.1) of a 2-form.
Our plan now is to build up an intuitive, geometrical understanding of p-forms by gradually
increasing p, one step at a time. Act V opened with an entire chapter devoted to 1-forms, and
this chapter is likewise completely devoted to understanding 2-forms. After that, we shall turn to
3-forms, . . . .
This sounds like a recipe for a book of inﬁnite length! Fortunately, by the time we arrive at
3-forms, all the essential ideas needed to understand general p-forms will be in play. Also, as we
shall explain in the next chapter, the highest p-form that can exist in an n-manifold is an n-form,
and since spacetime has only four dimensions, 4-forms will therefore sufﬁce for the purposes
of this book. (NOTE: Higher values of p are, however, required in some important applications
of Forms, such as the symplectic manifolds that naturally arise in Hamiltonian mechanics; see
Arnol’d (1989, Ch. 8).)
But why devote precious time and energy to such antisymmetric tensors in the ﬁrst place?
After all, with the one notable exception of the Riemann tensor, every important tensor we have
encountered thus far has been symmetric!

[34.1] Geometrical Proof That Oriented Area Is a 2-Form. [a] Expanding an edge by k expands the area by
k: A(ku, v) = k A(u, v). [b] Shearing A1 = A(u1, v) and A2 = A(u2, v) in the direction of v preserves their
areas, so A = A(u, v) = A1 + A2.
Only gradually will it become apparent the extent to which Élie Cartan was crazy like a fox.
As was the case with 1-forms, so too with 2-forms: Cartan recognized that they had been hiding
in plain sight!
34.2
Example: The Area 2-Form
In R2, let us deﬁne
A(u, v) = oriented area of the parallelogram with edges u and v.
Then A is a 2-form!
First, it is immediately clear that A(u, v) is antisymmetric: if we swap u and v, then the mag-
nitude of the area is unaltered, but the orientation of the parallelogram is reversed. It remains to
verify that A is a tensor, i.e., that it is linear in each slot. As we did with 1-forms, we may break
down the linearity requirement into two parts: (32.2) and (32.3), applied to each slot.
The truth of (32.3) is explained by [34.1a], which illustrates the fact that if we expand either
edge of a parallelogram by k, then its area is expanded by k, too:
A(ku, v) = A(u, kv) = k A(u, v).
Note that if Ψ is an arbitrary 2-form, then if (32.3) is true for one slot, it must be true for the
other slot, too:
Ψ(ku, v) = k Ψ(u, v)
=⇒
Ψ(u, kv) = −Ψ(kv, u) = −k Ψ(v, u) = k Ψ(u, v).
The truth of (32.2) is less obvious, but the argument just given means that we need only prove
it for the ﬁrst slot—the truth for the second slot then follows from antisymmetry.
Let u = u1 + u2, and deﬁne
A = A(u, v),
A1 = A(u1, v),
A2 = A(u2, v).
Then (32.2) requires that
A = A1 + A2.
That this is indeed true is demonstrated geometrically in [34.1b]. Thus A is indeed a 2-form.

372
•
Chapter 34 2-Forms
Note that if Ψ is a general 2-form, then the antisymmetry under swapping of the two vector
inputs implies that Ψ(u, u) = −Ψ(u, u), and so for arbitrary u,
Ψ(u, u) = 0.
(34.2)
In the case of the area 2-form, this makes direct geometrical sense: if in A(u, v) we let v become
u, then the parallelogram collapses into a line segment of vanishing area, so A(u, u) = 0.
In fact, (34.2) is equivalent to our original antisymmetry-based deﬁnition of a 2-form, (34.1). To
see this, we recycle an argument we previously employed in the context of the Riemann tensor.
Let x and y be arbitrary vectors, and let u = x + y. Then,
0
=
Ψ(u, u)
=
Ψ([x + y] , [x + y])
=
Ψ(x, x) + Ψ(x, y) + Ψ(y, x) + Ψ(y, y)
=
0 + Ψ(x, y) + Ψ(y, x) + 0.
Therefore, Ψ(y, x) = −Ψ(x, y). Done.
34.3
The Wedge Product of Two 1-Forms
Recall from (33.8) that any tensor of valence
{
0
2
}
can be split into the sum of a symmetric tensor
and an antisymmetric tensor. If we apply this procedure to the tensor product of two arbitrary
1-forms, then by swapping the 1-forms in the tensor products (instead of swapping the vectors)
we ﬁnd [exercise] that,
φ ⊗ψ = 1
2
[
φ ⊗ψ + ψ ⊗φ
]
+ 1
2
[
φ ⊗ψ −ψ ⊗φ
]
.
The antisymmetric part of this is, by deﬁnition, a 2-form created by multiplying two 1-forms. This
is a new kind of multiplication, called the wedge product,1 denoted ∧:
φ ∧ψ ≡φ ⊗ψ −ψ ⊗φ.
(34.3)
Just as the tensor product allows us to systematically build tensors of higher valence from
those of lower valence, so the wedge product allows us to build forms of higher degree from those
of lower degree.
Let us stress that what makes (φ ∧ψ) into a 2-form is the fact that when it acts on a pair of
vectors, it is linear in both slots, and swapping the two vector inputs simply reverses the sign of the
output, while keeping its magnitude ﬁxed:
(φ ∧ψ)(v1, v2) = φ(v1)ψ(v2) −ψ(v1)φ(v2) = −(φ ∧ψ)(v2, v1).
But observe that there is a second antisymmetry present, namely, that of the wedge product
itself. Keeping the order of the vector inputs the same, but swapping the 1-forms of the wedge product,
we see that
(φ ∧ψ)(v1, v2) = −(ψ ∧φ)(v1, v2).
1Also called the exterior product.

34.3 The Wedge Product of Two 1-Forms
•
373
Abstracting the vectors away, we have the antisymmetry of the wedge product itself, clearly
evident in the deﬁnition in (34.3):
(φ ∧ψ) = −(ψ ∧φ).
Note that this implies, for arbitrary ψ,
ψ ∧ψ = 0.
Also note that the wedge product distributes over addition:
φ ∧(ψ + σ) = φ ∧ψ + φ ∧σ.
In R2, consider all possible wedge products of the Cartesian basis 1-forms. Since dx ∧dx = 0
and dy ∧dy = 0, the only nonvanishing wedge product is dx ∧dy = −dy ∧dx. And, in fact, this
is none other than the area 2-form!
A = dx ∧dy.
(34.4)
Note that this again bears a striking resemblance to the classical expression for area: when we
do a double integral, we write the element of area as dx dy. The explicit connection follows the
same pattern as our earlier examples of the differential df and of the line element ds. If we take
u = δx e1 and v = δy e2 to be the sides of a small rectangle, then
(dx ∧dy)(u, v) = (dx ∧dy)(δx e1, δy e2) = δx δy.
The general proof of (34.4) is easily achieved using components:
(dx ∧dy)(u, v)
=
(dx ⊗dy −dy ⊗dx)
([

Let us now describe the geometrical meaning of the wedge product (φ ∧ψ) of two general
1-forms acting on vectors in Rn. The argument will apply to any n, but to keep the idea vivid,
let us illustrate it in the case of R3. In this case, both φ and ψ are represented by stacks of planes,
and their action on a vector v in R3 is to count how many planes of each stack are pierced, as
illustrated in [34.2].
Now comes the crucial idea: let us use these two numbers φ(v) and ψ(v) as the x and y coordinates
of a point in R2. The two 1-forms thereby deﬁne a mapping F of vectors in R3 (or any Rn) to vectors
in R2:
v −→F(v) ≡
[
φ(v)
ψ(v)
]

[34.2] Geometrical Meaning of the Wedge Product. A parallelogram P in R3 has edges v1 and v2, and φ(vk)
and ψ(vk) count how many planes of each stack are pierced by the edge vk. The mapping F fuses these pairs
of piercing numbers (φ(vk), ψ(vk)) into Cartesian coordinates in R2, mapping P to the parallelogram F(P).
Then (φ ∧ψ)(v1, v2) is the oriented area A of F(P).
Under this mapping F, a parallelogram in Rn with edges v1 and v2 is mapped to a parallel-
ogram in R2 with edges F(v1) and F(v2), as illustrated in [34.2]. We can now state the beautifully
simple meaning of the wedge product:2
When the wedge product (φ ∧ψ) is applied to an arbitarary parallelogram in
Rn, it outputs the oriented area of the image parallelogram in R2 under the
mapping F:
(φ ∧ψ)(v1, v2) = A

The Area 2-Form in Polar Coordinates
When we do a double integral in R2, we write the element of area as dA = dx dy, and we have
previously explained how this is connected to the area 2-form, (34.4): A = dx ∧dy. But when we
switch to polar coordinates we instead write the element of area as dA = r dr dθ. In this case,
2Arnol’d (1989, §32) goes a step further, taking (34.6) to be the deﬁnition of the wedge product.

[34.3] Geometric proof that δA ≍r δθ δr.
there is a simple geometric derivation of this formula,
shown in [34.3]. The corresponding 2-form is therefore
A = r dr ∧dθ.
However, when we do a more complicated
change of coordinates, the traditional method (which
you undoubtedly learned in multivariable calculus)
requires us to use the Jacobian to ﬁnd the expression
for the element of area in the new coordinate system.
As we now demonstrate, using polar coordinates as
our example, the use of the area 2-form allows us to
jettison the Jacobian, and turns the entire affair into
(mindless) algebraic child’s play!
Applying the Leibnitz Rule (32.12), and remem-
bering that dr ∧dr = 0, and dθ ∧dθ = 0, and dθ ∧dr =

34.5
Basis 2-Forms and Projections
It is clear that the sum of two 2-forms is another 2-form, and likewise multiplication by a constant
also yields another 2-form. Therefore, the 2-forms constitute a vector space, and so it is natural to
seek a basis for this space.
Recall from (33.2) that the set of tensors {dxi ⊗dxj} forms a basis for tensors of valence
{
0
2
}
.
This applies to all such tensors, including the 2-forms, but in the case of 2-forms we go a step
further:
The set of 2-forms {dxi ∧dxj}, with i < j, is a basis for the 2-forms.
(34.7)
The condition i < j is imposed simply to avoid listing duplicate 2-forms: e.g., (dx3 ∧dx2) =
−(dx2 ∧dx3).
Since dxi ∧dxi = 0, the nonvanishing (nonredundant) basis 2-forms result from picking an
unordered pair of distinct dxi’s, (out of n) then forming their wedge product. So, if we assume
(34.7) is true, then,
In Rn, the set of 2-forms is a vector space of dimension 1
2n(n −1).
(34.8)
To conﬁrm (34.7), let us begin in R2. If Ψ were merely a generic tensor of valence
{
0
2
}
, then
we know from (33.2) that it can be expanded as
Ψ = Ψ11(dx ⊗dx) + Ψ12(dx ⊗dy) + Ψ21(dy ⊗dx) + Ψ22(dy ⊗dy).

376
•
Chapter 34 2-Forms
But, because Ψ is a 2-form
Ψ11 = 0 = Ψ22
and
Ψ21 = −Ψ12.
Therefore,
Ψ = Ψ12 (dx ∧dy) = Ψ12 A.
In other words, (dx ∧dy) is a basis for 2-forms in R2, and every 2-form is proportional to the area
2-form.
If we now go up one dimension to R3, then [exercise] exactly the same reasoning yields
Ψ = Ψ23 (dy ∧dz) + Ψ31 (dz ∧dx) + Ψ12 (dx ∧dy),
(34.9)
conﬁrming (34.7) for this case. (NOTE: The reason for writing these three terms in the way that we
have, and in the strange order that we have, will be explained in the next section.)
The proof in Rn is a straightforward extension of these examples. The nonvanishing terms in
the expansion (33.2) always come in opposite pairs:
Ψij (dxi ⊗dxj) + Ψji (dxj ⊗dxi) = Ψij (dxi ⊗dxj) −Ψij (dxj ⊗dxi) = Ψij (dxi ∧dxj).
Let us return to R3 and seek out the meaning of the basis 2-forms that arise in (34.9), beginning
with (dx ∧dy). In R2 this was simply the area 2-form in the (x, y)-plane, and the meaning in R3
is closely related, as illustrated in [34.4]:
If (dx ∧dy) is applied to a parallelogram P in R3, the output is the oriented area
Az of the orthogonal projection (in the z-direction) of P onto the (x, y)-plane.
This is a direct consequence of the geometric interpretation (34.6) of the wedge product of two
arbitrary 1-forms. The key is to realize that in this case the mapping F simply reduces to orthogonal
projection in the z-direction onto the (x, y)-plane. Simply compare with the general construction
of the wedge product in [34.2]: here φ = dx is a unit-spaced stack perpendicular to the x-axis, and
likewise ψ = dy is a unit-spaced stack perpendicular to the y-axis. (Please take a moment to make
sure that you can actually see all this.)
As illustrated in [34.4], the meaning of the other two basis 2-forms is completely analogous:
(dy ∧dz) is the area Ax of the projection (in the x-direction) onto the (y, z)-plane; and (dz ∧dx) is
the area Ay of the projection (in the y-direction) onto the (z, x)-plane.
In R4, the generalization of (34.9) instead contains six basis 2-forms, (dxi ∧dxj), but each one
has the same meaning as above: for example, (dx1 ∧dx3) yields the oriented area in the (x1, x3)-
plane after projection along the x2 and x4 axes.

Associating 2-Forms with Vectors in R3: Flux
As we shall see, it is possible to do calculus with Forms in any number of dimensions. But the
Vector Calculus we learn as undergraduates in college is only possible in three dimensions, and in
this section and the next we begin to understand why.

[34.4] Geometric Meaning of Basis 2-Forms. Each basis 2-form
yields the area of the projection of P onto the relevant coordi-
nate plane. For example, (dx ∧dy)(v1, v2) = Az, the area of the
projection of P in the z-direction onto the (x, y)-plane.
Geometrically, there is cer-
tainly
no
confusion
possible
between 2-forms and vectors.
Even algebraically the distinc-
tion is clear: in n dimensions, a
vector has n components, where-
as a 2-form has 1
2n(n −1) com-
ponents, as we saw in (34.8).
But this implies that some-
thing remarkable happens when
n = 3: In three dimensions, and
only in three dimensions, 2-forms
have the same number of compo-
nents as vectors.
Vector Calculus, so success-
fully pioneered by physicists in
the 1880s, and still considered
an indispensable tool of mod-
ern science in the twenty-ﬁrst
century, can now be seen to
rest upon this singular numeri-
cal coincidence. Though the pio-
neers of Vector Calculus could
not have had any inkling as to
why their mathematical engine
purred with such power, the reason was that it actually had 2-forms hidden under the bonnet,
but masquerading as vectors!
To begin to look under the bonnet, let us rewrite the components (34.9) of the general 2-form
Ψ with a single raised index, and immediately identity these with components of a corresponding
vector, which we shall denote by the same symbol as the 2-form, but underlined: Ψ, i.e.,
Ψ = Ψ1 (dx2 ∧dx3) + Ψ2 (dx3 ∧dx1) + Ψ3 (dx1 ∧dx2)
⇄
Ψ =


Ψ1
Ψ2
Ψ3

.
(34.10)
The most natural mathematical way to understand this correspondence is via the Hodge star
duality operator (⋆), which is the subject of Exercise 15. It is a purely mathematical operation that
(in n dimensions) maps a p-form to an (n −p)-form, called its Hodge dual (usually abbreviated
simply to dual), named after the important British mathematician, Sir W.V.D. Hodge (1903–1975).3
Here, however, we shall instead pursue a logical and compelling physical reason for associat-
ing a 2-form with a vector in this way, and to understand it we must now introduce the physicist’s
powerful concept of ﬂux.4
3Hodge was my mathematical grandfather: I studied under Penrose, who studied under Hodge.
4We shall explain the concept of ﬂux using ﬂuid ﬂow, but it was originally introduced intuitively by Faraday to describe his
ingenious experiments (beginning in the 1820s) on the ﬂow of electric and magnetic ﬁelds through a surface in space; in the
decades that followed, Maxwell gave the concept its current mathematical form. See Forbes and Mahon (2014, §10).

Chapter 34 2-Forms
Reconsider [34.4], and imagine a uniform ﬂow of ﬂuid through space with velocity Ψ. Now
deﬁne,
Φ(v1, v2) ≡Amount of ﬂuid crossing P per unit time = ﬂux of Ψ through P.
(34.11)
We count the ﬂux as positive if the orientation of P is counterclockwise around Ψ. If we picture all
the ﬂuid that passes through P in unit time, it will ﬁll a parallelepiped with edges v1, v2, Ψ, and
the ﬂux will be its volume, as illustrated in [34.5]. It follows [exercise] that the ﬂux Φ is actually a
2-form.


v2

v1, v2
[34.5] Flux of Ψ through P = volume Φ(v1, v2)
It is natural to now ask the following ques-
tion: How is this ﬂux 2-form Φ related to the 2-form
Ψ associated with the ﬂow velocity Ψ?
We begin with a simple example. Suppose in
[34.4] that Ψ = Ψ3 e3 is purely upward, parallel to
the z-axis. Clearly the ﬂux through P is the same
as the ﬂux through its projection Az = A3. But if
we picture the ﬂuid ﬂowing upward with speed
Ψ3 through A3 for one unit of time, then the ﬂuid
will ﬁll a solid whose base area is A3 and whose
height is Ψ3, so the ﬂux is Ψ3A3.
In the general case, the same reasoning
applies to each component of Ψ, so the total ﬂux
is simply the sum:
Φ(v1, v2)
=
Ψ1A1 + Ψ2A2 + Ψ3A3
=
Ψ1 (dx2 ∧dx3)(v1, v2) + Ψ2 (dx3 ∧dx1)(v1, v2) + Ψ3 (dx1 ∧dx2)(v1, v2)
=
Ψ(v1, v2).
Therefore,
Φ = Ψ !
Thus we have obtained a satisfying physical justiﬁcation for associating a 2-form with a vector
via (34.10):
If ﬂuid ﬂows through 3-dimensional space with velocity Ψ, its ﬂux 2-form is Ψ,
and vice versa.
(34.12)
In addition to using components to connect the 2-form Ψ to its associated vector Ψ, as we
initially did in (34.10), we may also identify the direction of the associated vector geometrically,
instead. The ﬂux of Ψ across the parallelogram P vanishes if and only if it contains the direction Ψ,
so we can uniquely characterize the ﬂow direction by means of vanishing ﬂux:
Ψ(Ψ , . . .) = 0.

Relation of the Vector and Wedge Products in R3
The conjuring trick that pulls Vector Calculus out of the top hat labelled “Forms” has a second
component: we also associate 1-forms with vectors, just as we previously did in Section 33.8. Given
a 1-form φ, we will again denote the corresponding vector with same symbol as the 1-form, but
underlined:
φ = φ1 dx1 + φ2 dx2 + φ3 dx3

φ =

(34.14)
The two fundamental kinds of multiplication in Vector Calculus are the scalar product (aka
dot product) and the vector product (aka cross product). The former readily generalizes to any
number of dimensions, and can be expressed as
φ(v) = φ·v.

[34.6] The Vector Product.
But the vector product, illustrated in [34.6], is peculiar to
three dimensions. Given two vectors φ and σ, with the angle
from the ﬁrst to the second being θ, recall that we deﬁne the
vector product φ × σ to be the vector orthogonal to both, its
direction given by the right-hand rule, and its length being the
area of the parallelogram they span:
|φ × σ| ≡A(φ, σ) = |φ| |σ| sin θ.
We should immediately be suspicious: the length of a vector
is equal to an area?! The reality is that we are dealing with a sec-
ond sleight of hand: the vector product is not what it appears
to be—it is actually the wedge product of the corresponding
1-forms! The full explanation for this lies with the previously
mentioned Hodge duality; see Exercise 15.
φ × σ
⇄
φ ∧σ.
(34.16)
Before proving this correspondence, let us pause to recognize how special it is: in any number
of dimensions, we are free to associate two vectors with two 1-forms, and we may then form their
wedge product, but the resulting 2-form will have 1
2n(n −1) components, and so in general it
cannot be reinterpreted as a vector. Only in three dimensions can a 2-form be identiﬁed as the ﬂux
2-form Ψ of a vector ﬂow Ψ.

380
•
Chapter 34 2-Forms
In order to prove (34.16), let us deﬁne the 2-form Ψ ≡φ ∧σ. Then we must show that Ψ =
φ × σ. We will prove this in two stages. First we will show that the vectors Ψ and n ≡φ × σ point
in the same direction, and then we will show that they have the same length.
Since n ≡φ × σ is, by deﬁnition, orthogonal to φ and σ,
φ(n) = φ·n = 0
and
σ(n) = σ·n = 0.
This then implies that the ﬂux vanishes for any parallelogram containing n:
Ψ(n, . . .) = (φ ∧σ)(n, . . .) = φ(n) σ(. . .) −σ(n) φ(. . .) = 0.
Thus, as discussed in (34.13), this implies that n is aligned with the ﬂow: Ψ ∝n.
It remains to show that the speeds of the two ﬂows match: |Ψ| = |n| = A(φ, σ) = |φ| |σ| sin θ. We
begin by noting that since we now know that Ψ is orthogonal to the parallelogram P with edges
φ and σ, its ﬂux across P is given by
ﬂux = |Ψ| A(φ, σ).
But,
ﬂux
=
Ψ(φ, σ)
=
(φ ∧σ)(φ, σ)
=
φ(φ) σ(σ) −σ(φ) φ(σ)
=
|φ|2 |σ|2 −|φ|2 |σ|2 cos2 θ
=
[A(φ, σ)]2.
Combining the previous two results,
|Ψ| A(φ, σ) = ﬂux = [A(φ, σ)]2.
Therefore,
|Ψ| = A(φ, σ) = |φ × σ|
=⇒
Ψ = φ × σ,
proving (34.16).
Having established (34.16) geometrically, we may now use it to derive the standard algebraic
expression for the vector product from the underlying formula for the wedge product:
Ψ
=
φ ∧σ
=
(φ1 dx1 + φ2 dx2 + φ3 dx3) ∧(σ1 dx1 + σ2 dx2 + σ3 dx3)
=
(φ2 σ3 −φ3 σ2)(dx2 ∧dx3) + (φ3 σ1 −φ1 σ3)(dx3 ∧dx1) + (φ1 σ2 −φ2 σ1)(dx1 ∧dx2).
The associated vector Ψ = φ × σ is therefore given by the familiar formula from Vector Calculus:

The Faraday and Maxwell Electromagnetic 2-Forms
INTRODUCTORY NOTES: This section is ent-
[34.7] Michael Faraday (1791–1867).
irely optional; it is not required to under-
stand the mathematics that will follow
(though it is a prerequisite for Section 36.6).
That said, this section is very important,
for it is our ﬁrst demonstration that Forms
are not only inhabitants of a Platonic,
mathematical universe—they also reach out
and weave their way into the very fab-
ric of the laws of the physical Universe!
One more thing: in order to ease the tran-
sition of the reader in passing from our
treatment to more advanced works—such
as Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973),
Schutz (1980), Baez and Muniain (1994),
and Frankel (2012)—we have (reluctantly)
adopted their convention, in which the met-
ric coefﬁcients of spacetime are the negatives
of those we have employed up to this point.
So, now and hereafter, the Minkowski
metric is
ds2 = −dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
There are several 2-forms in 4-dimens-
ional spacetime that play fundamental
roles in the laws of physics. In this section we shall describe two of these that together lead to
an extraordinarily compact and elegant description of the laws of electromagnetism (detailed
in Section 36.6). These 2-forms are named after Michael Faraday (1791–1867) and James Clerk
Maxwell (1831–1879), who are pictured in [34.7] and [34.8], respectively.
The laws of electromagnetism were ﬁrst discovered empirically in a long, symphonic
sequence of utterly ingenious experiments conducted by the self-educated Michael Faraday in
his basement laboratory within the Royal Institution of London.5 These experiments began in the
1820s, and reached their climax in 1830s. See Forbes and Mahon (2014, §§4–5).
5We strongly encourage you to visit the remains of Faraday’s laboratory, where you may kneel down (reverentially!) to study
the ﬁrst electric generator—carefully preserved, mere inches away from you behind glass—ever constructed by the human
race!

Chapter 34 2-Forms
[34.8] James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879).
Maxwell was quick to recognize the
explanatory value of Faraday’s ideas of
lines of force and of ﬂux, and, unlike Fara-
day, Maxwell possessed the mathematical
skills to give them precise form. Indeed,
not since Newton had the world wit-
nessed such an alchemical fusion of pro-
found physical insight and raw mathemat-
ical power.
By 1873 the job was done: Maxwell
announced four6 equations that comple-
tely described electricity, magnetism, and
the interaction between the two. In partic-
ular, Maxwell used his equations to calcu-
late the speed with which purely theoreti-
cal waves of electromagnetic energy would
travel through empty space. His numerical
answer coincided with the experimentally
measured speed of light—Maxwell was the
ﬁrst human to understand what light is—an
electromagnetic wave!
It is moving to read the letters7 that
passed between these two giants of science.
One is struck by Maxwell’s deep admiration of the profundity of Faraday’s physical insights
and his experimental ingenuity, and, symmetrically, Faraday’s awe of Maxwell’s extraordinary
prowess in crystalizing physical intuitions into precise mathematical laws.
Einstein’s 1905 discovery of Special Relativity was directly connected to these electromagnetic
revelations of Faraday and Maxwell. Indeed, the title of Einstein’s epoch-making paper makes no
mention of either space or time—it reads, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.”8
The impetus for Einstein’s breakthrough was his realization that electric and magnetic ﬁelds
do not separately have an absolute existence—they are merely two, observer-dependent aspects
of a single electromagnetic ﬁeld, and waves of this ﬁeld (light!) travel at the same speed for all
observers. This led him (via Minkowski) to the realization that space and time cannot separately
have an absolute existence—they are observer-dependent aspects of the geometry of spacetime,
which does have absolute existence.
Let us simply quote the opening paragraph of Einstein’s paper of 1905:
It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—
when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent
in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet
and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion
of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction
between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion.
For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbour-
hood of the magnet an electric ﬁeld with a certain deﬁnite energy, producing a current
at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary
6It was actually Oliver Heaviside who in 1885 reduced Maxwell’s original set of 20 equations to the four we now know as
“Maxwell’s Equations”! See Forbes and Mahon (2014, §16) and Mahon (2017).
7See Forbes and Mahon (2014), and Jones (1870).

and the conductor in motion, no electric ﬁeld arises in the neighbourhood of the mag-
net. In the conductor, however, we ﬁnd an electromotive force, to which in itself there
is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion
in the two cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those
produced by the electric forces in the former case.
The classical description of these ﬁelds is as two 3-dimensional vector ﬁelds, with six
components in all, each one being a function of space and of time:
Electric ﬁeld = E =


Ex
Ey
Ez


and
Magnetic ﬁeld = B =


Bx
By
Bz

.
Each of these may be associated both with a ﬂux 2-form—via (34.10)—and with a 1-form, via
(34.14). For the electric ﬁeld we shall call the ﬂux 2-form E, and the 1-form ε:
E = Ex (dy ∧dz) + Ey (dz ∧dx) + Ez (dx ∧dy),
(34.18)
and
ε = Ex dx + Ey dy + Ez dz.
(34.19)
We do the same for the magnetic ﬁeld, writing the ﬂux 2-form as B, and the 1-form as β:
B = Bx (dy ∧dz) + By (dz ∧dx) + Bz (dx ∧dy)
(34.20)
and
β = Bx dx + By dy + Bz dz.
(34.21)
As Einstein explained (see above), none of these 2-forms and 1-forms has an absolute,
observer-independent existence. That is, observers in relative motion will disagree about the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds, but they will also disagree about space and time in precisely such a way as
to make physical phenomena independent of the observer’s motion: there can be only one physical
reality!
Very remarkably—and very beautifully!—Nature informs us that the electric and magnetic 2-
forms and 1-forms combine into a single electromagnetic 2-form that does have absolute meaning in
spacetime!
It is called9 the Faraday 2-form, and is denoted F:
F = Faraday = ε ∧dt + B.
(34.22)
Let us immediately describe the physical (observer-independent) meaning of F.
9This is the terminology employed by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), but it is not universal: for example, Penrose (2005)
instead calls F the “Maxwell 2-form.” As we shall explain in a moment, we reserve the name Maxwell 2-form for a different
2-form.

384
•
Chapter 34 2-Forms
If we insert a vector u into the second slot of F then we obtain F(. . . , u). This will yield a
number when a vector is inserted into the ﬁrst slot; therefore, as it stands, it must be a 1-form.
Suppose we place a charge q in the electromagnetic ﬁeld described by F. Let the particle’s
4-velocity vector in spacetime be u, let its 4-momentum be described by the 1-form π, and let its
proper time (aka “wrist-watch time”) be τ. Then q F(. . . , u) describes the electromagnetic force exerted
on the particle
dπ
dτ = q F(. . . , u).
(34.23)
This is a 1-form, awaiting the insertion of a vector, and (physically) the resulting number is the
magnitude of the force acting in the direction of the inserted vector.
Contrast this with the more complicated formula—the Lorentz Force Law—that one learns in
introductory electrodynamics for the rate of change of the spatial vector momentum p of a particle
that has spatial vector velocity v:
dp
dt = q (E + v × B).
In this classical formulation, different observers in relative motion will all disagree about the values of p,
E, v, and B! (For a fuller discussion of this point, see Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973, §3.3).)
Contrast this with the elegance of the geometrical, observer-independent, spacetime law, (34.23)!
Before we introduce the Maxwell 2-form, let us state Maxwell’s Equations of electromag-
netism, which we shall divide into two pairs of equations.
The ﬁrst pair describes the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the absence of sources (meaning the (scalar)
electric charge density ρ, and the (vector) current density j):
Maxwell’s Source-Free Equations:
∇·B
=
0,
∇× E + BtB
=
0.
(34.24)
As we shall see in Section 36.6, when expressed in terms of the Faraday 2-form, these two equa-
tions reduce to a single, elegant equation.
The second pair of Maxwell’s equations describes the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by
sources:
Maxwell’s Source Equations:
∇·E
=
4πρ,
∇× B −BtE
=
4π j.
(34.25)
This second pair also reduces to a single, elegant equation—to be derived in Section 36.6—but
this time in terms of a different 2-form that is closely to related to F, and is denoted ⋆F. This is
the Maxwell 2-form10, which is almost (but not quite) the result of interchanging the roles of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the Faraday 2-form:
10As noted in footnote 9, this terminology is not universal: Penrose (2005) instead calls F the Maxwell 2-form.

34.8 The Faraday and Maxwell Electromagnetic 2-Forms
•
385
⋆F = Maxwell = β ∧dt −E.
(34.26)
The star operator (⋆) is the previously mentioned Hodge duality operator; see Exercise 15. It is a
purely mathematical operation that (in n dimensions) maps a p-form to an (n −p)-form. Since we
are in 4 dimensions, ⋆maps the 2-form F to another 2-form ⋆F, the (Hodge) dual of F. If we apply
the star operator a second time, in other words take the dual of Maxwell, then we recover Faraday
(only with a minus):
⋆⋆F = −F.
(34.27)
Thus we may say that Maxwell and Faraday are the duals of one another—a nomenclature
that we suspect both scientists would have relished, if only they had lived to see it.

Chapter 35
3-Forms
35.1
A 3-Form Requires Three Dimensions
Let us begin by recognizing that 3-forms require at least three dimensions in order to exist.
In R2, it is easy enough to create a tensor H of valence
{
0
3
}
. For example, take any 1-form φ,
and construct,
H = φ ⊗φ ⊗φ
=⇒
H(v1, v2, v3) = φ(v1) φ(v2) φ(v3).
As we see, this tensor is totally symmetric, meaning that swapping any pair of input vectors returns
the same output.
But to create a 3-form, Ξ, we require (by deﬁnition) that our tensor be totally antisymmetric, and
this is impossible! Consider the components of Ξ:
Ξijk= Ξ (ei, ej, ek).
In R2 there are only two basis vectors, {e1, e2}, so that means two of the slots of Ξ contain the same
vector, but then antisymmetry demands that the output vanishes.
In order for Ξijk not to vanish identically, it is therefore essential that all three indices be dis-
tinct: in other words, we must be in at least three dimensions. Clearly, exactly the same reasoning
shows, quite generally, that the existence of a p-form requires at least p dimensions.
We can also turn this around and observe that the highest degree form that can exist in n dimens-
ions is an n-form.
35.2
The Wedge Product of a 2-Form and 1-Form
The wedge product of two 1-forms yielded a 2-form, and we now seek to extend the deﬁnition of
the wedge product so as to ensure that multiplication of a 2-form Ψ and a 1-form σ automatically
yields a 3-form, Ψ ∧σ.
Let us begin with simplest possible (ill-fated) guess: how about
(Ψ ∧σ)(v1, v2, v3) ???
= Ψ(v1, v2) σ(v3) ?
Well, this is clearly antisymmetric under v1 ↔v2, but not under v2 ↔v3, so let us impose antisym-
metry, using the same trick we used in (33.8). That is, let us subtract the same expression with
v2 ↔v3:
(Ψ ∧σ)(v1, v2, v3) ???
= Ψ(v1, v2) σ(v3) −Ψ(v1, v3) σ(v2) ?
But now the second term has ruined antisymmetry under v1 ↔v2, so repeat the trick and
subtract that same term, but with v1 ↔v2:
(Ψ ∧σ)(v1, v2, v3) ???
= Ψ(v1, v2) σ(v3) −
[
Ψ(v1, v3) σ(v2) −Ψ(v2, v3) σ(v1)
]
?
386

35.3 The Volume 3-Form
•
387
Success!
(Ψ ∧σ)(v1, v2, v3) = Ψ(v1, v2) σ(v3) + Ψ(v3, v1) σ(v2) + Ψ(v2, v3) σ(v1).
(35.1)
Note the cyclic permutation of the vectors, which makes the formula easy to remember.
We can play the same game to deﬁne a seemingly different 3-form, (σ ∧Ψ), but this turns out
to be the same 3-form, (Ψ ∧σ)! To see why, simply move each σ(vi) to the front of each term on
the right-hand side of (35.1), and observe that this preserves the cyclic permutation:
(σ ∧Ψ)(v1, v2, v3) = σ(v1) Ψ(v2, v3) + σ(v2) Ψ(v3, v1) + σ(v3) Ψ(v1, v2).
(35.2)
Therefore, although the wedge product is antisymmetric when it combines two 1-forms, i.e.,
(φ ∧ψ) = −(ψ ∧φ),
it is symmetric when it combines a 2-form Ψ and a 1-form σ:
Ψ ∧σ = σ ∧Ψ.
Here is the general rule, which we will justify shortly:
If Ψ is a p-form and Ωis a q-form, then Ψ ∧Ω= (−1)pq Ω∧Ψ .
(35.3)
You may easily check that the previous two equations conform to this rule.
Assuming (35.3) to be true, we also deduce that if the degree of Ωis odd, then [exercise],
Ω∧Ω= 0.
(35.4)
Of course the wedge product of a 1-form with itself was our ﬁrst instance of this phenomenon:
ψ ∧ψ = 0.
35.3
The Volume 3-Form
Now let us take Ψ = dx1 ∧dx2 and σ = dx3, and deﬁne the volume 3-form to be
V ≡(dx1 ∧dx2) ∧dx3.
(35.5)
We now justify the naming of V.

388
•
Chapter 35 3-Forms
Look again at the standard formula (34.17) for the volume of a parallelepiped with edges u,
v, and Ω. If we apply our 3-form V to these three vectors, then (35.1) yields
V(u, v, Ω)
=
[(dx1 ∧dx2) ∧dx3](u, v, Ω)

Once again, (35.5) reminds us of a classical
expression: when doing a triple integral in
space, we write the element of volume as
dV = dx dy dz. This connection can easily be
made explicit, in the same way as before:
applying dx ∧dy ∧dz to the vector edges of
a small box with sides δx, δy, δz, we obtain its
volume, δV = δx δy δz.
If we switch to spherical polar coordi-
nates, (r, ϕ, ϑ), then the classical element of
volume becomes,
dV = r2 sin ϕ dr dϕ dϑ.
Figure [35.1] contains a direct, geometrical
proof, enabling us to understand this result.
Note that this ﬁgure also provides the for-
mulas for the coordinate change: since the
distance of a point on the sphere from the NS,
z-axis is ρ = r sin ϕ,
x
=
ρ cos ϑ = (r sin ϕ) cos ϑ,
y
=
ρ sin ϑ = (r sin ϕ) sin ϑ,
z
=
r cos ϕ.
Finally, note that the order (r, ϕ, ϑ) of the coordinates1 has been chosen so that the movements
resulting from small increases in the coordinates are right handed. Make sure you can see this.
1We are using the (logical!) convention of American mathematicians, whereby ϑ denotes the angle within the (x, y)-plane,
just as it does in R2. However, British mathematicians, and essentially all scientists, interchange the meanings of ϑ and ϕ, so
their order of the coordinates, and their volume 3-form, will appear to be different from ours. There are actually compelling
historical reasons for adopting the physicists’ choice—spherical harmonics immediately come to mind—and the conﬂict could
be resolved if only we could all agree to change the angle in R2 to ϕ! Dray (2015) is a rare, brave adopter of this solution.

In the case of a more complicated change of coordinates, we would traditionally be forced to
calculate the Jacobian. Well, no longer!
Let us use the example of spherical polar coordinates to demonstrate how (in more difﬁcult
cases) the volume 3-form saves us time, memorization, and even the need to think!
Well, a little thinking is certainly helpful: when multiplying out the wedge products below,
we are only looking for ways to obtain dr ∧dϕ ∧dϑ, because all other terms vanish. Towards the
end of the calculation, we write cϑ ≡cos ϑ, and so forth, to save space, but we also recommend
this as a clarifying notation in private, pencil-and-paper calculations.

lation, essentially you stop thinking: you stop thinking geometrically, you stop thinking about the

These are but the ﬁrst glimpses of the power of the “Devil’s machine.” You must therefore

The Wedge Product of Three 1-Forms and of p 1-Forms
To conﬁrm the associativity we have just claimed, let us generalize the discussion, and deﬁne
the wedge product of three arbitrary 1-forms. We wish to label the three 1-forms systemati-
cally, but we also wish to avoid any possible confusion with components, so let us call them
σ
1 , σ
2 , σ
3 .
The formula for σ
1 ∧σ
2 ∧σ
3 can be found by taking Ψ = σ
1 ∧σ
2 in (35.1), but it is simpler
to generalize the geometrical mapping (34.5) and the resulting geometrical interpretation given
in [34.2].
That is, let us use the three 1-forms to deﬁne a mapping F of a vector v in Rn to a vector F(v)
in R3:
v −→F(v) ≡


σ
1 (v)
σ
2 (v)
σ
3 (v)


(35.6)
Thus a parallelepiped in Rn with edges v1, v2, and v3, is mapped by F to a parallelepiped in R3
with edges F(v1), F(v2), and F(v3), and, by analogy with [34.2], we can deﬁne σ
1 ∧σ
2 ∧σ

operator that yields the volume of this image parallelepiped:

Equation (35.7) describes the action of a 3-form on three vectors, but can we abstract away the
vectors to reveal the 3-form itself? Yes, but to do so, we need to deal directly with tensor products,
just as we did in the original deﬁnition (34.3) of the wedge product of two 1-forms.
To achieve our goal, we must try to write down an expression that is antisymmetric under
exchange of any pair of 1-forms. It is possible to do this [exercise] by working backwards from
(35.7), but it is actually simpler to attack the problem head on. Try this yourself, before studying
the answer, which is here:

(35.8)
Note that the positive terms on the top line are the cyclic permutations of 123, whereas the
negative terms on the second line are the noncyclic permutations. Each term on the second line is
obtained by swapping the ﬁrst two 1-forms in the cyclic term directly above it.
We leave it you to check that (35.8) is indeed equivalent to (35.7).
35.6
Basis 3-Forms
Just as {dxi ∧dxj} formed a basis for 2-forms, so {dxi ∧dxj ∧dxk} forms a basis for 3-forms. In R3
there is only one such basis 3-form, namely, the volume 3-form, V = dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3; all 3-forms
in R3 are simply multiples of V.
In R4, however, there are four distinct basis 3-forms, and a general 3-form Ωcan be decom-
posed into components as follows:
Ω= Ω123 (dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3) + Ω234 (dx2 ∧dx3 ∧dx4) + Ω341 (dx3 ∧dx4 ∧dx1)
+ Ω412 (dx4 ∧dx1 ∧dx2).
Let us now use such components to explain the rule (35.3). To make the argument vivid,
let us take p = 2 and q = 3, so that Ψ is a 2-form and Ωis a 3-form. When we form Ψ ∧Ω, a
typical component (dxj1 ∧dxj2) of Ψ is multiplied by a typical component (dxk1 ∧dxk2 ∧dxk3)

35.7 Is Ψ ∧Ψ ̸= 0 Possible?
•
391
of Ω. (We assume that we are in at least ﬁve dimensions, otherwise this product vanishes
identically!)
Now we wish to transform this into a term of the reversed product, Ω∧Ψ. To do so, we must
begin by moving dxj2 through the three 1-forms to its right, with each successive swap producing
a change of sign:
(dxj1 ∧dxj2) ∧(dxk1 ∧dxk2 ∧dxk3)
=
−dxj1 ∧dxk1 ∧dxj2 ∧dxk2 ∧dxk3
=
+ dxj1 ∧dxk1 ∧dxk2 ∧dxj2 ∧dxk3
=
−dxj1 ∧(dxk1 ∧dxk2 ∧dxk2) ∧dxj2.
With q = 3, this has resulted in a factor of (−1)3 = −1, and in the general case the factor would
be (−1)q. To complete the reversal of Ψ ∧Ωto create Ω∧Ψ, we must now move dxj1 through the
1-forms of Ωso as to reform (dxj1 ∧dxj2) on the right. In so doing, we pick up a second factor of
(−1)q. In the general case, we must repeat this for each of the p 1-forms of Ψ, picking up p factors
of (−1)q. Therefore, the net factor is (−1)pq, which completes the proof of (35.3).
35.7
Is Ψ ∧Ψ ̸= 0 Possible?
One consequence of the rule (35.3), which we have now proved, is (35.4): if Ψ is of odd degree, then
Ψ ∧Ψ = 0.
Thus, if it were possible for Ψ ∧Ψ ̸= 0, then Ψ would have to be of even degree. The simplest
possibility is therefore that Ψ is a 2-form, in which case Ψ ∧Ψ would be a 4-form. The smallest
number of dimensions in which a 4-form can exist is 4, so let us take Ψ to be a 2-form in spacetime,
with coordinates (t, x, y, z).
Consider,
Ψ = dt ∧dx + dy ∧dz.
If V denotes the volume 4-form of spacetime, then [exercise],
Ψ ∧Ψ = 2 dt ∧dx ∧dy ∧dz = 2V.

Chapter 36
Differentiation
36.1
The Exterior Derivative of a 1-Form
In the context of Forms, a function f is taken to be a 0-form. When the exterior derivative d
is applied to f, it yields the gradient 1-form df, which encodes how fast f changes in all possible
directions.
If we wish to know the rate of change of f in a speciﬁc direction u, we must submit it as a
question to the oracle 1-form df, which then declares the answer to be (32.11):
df(u) = ∇uf.
In summary, d measures the rate of change in all possible directions, and it increases the degree of
the form by one, to allow for the input of an additional vector, along which to measure the rate of
change of the form.
Expressed in this manner, our task is clear: we must extend the deﬁnition of d so that when
it is applied to a p-form Ψ it yields a (p + 1)-form dΨ that measures the rate of change of Ψ in all
possible directions.
As is our custom, we shall begin with the simplest possible case, then gradually work our
way up. So, let us try to differentiate a 1-form φ to obtain a 2-form dφ, acting on pairs of vectors,
u and v.
In order for a rate of change to even make sense, we must imagine that the 1-form, and the
vectors upon which it acts, are deﬁned in at least a neighborhood of the point at which we seek
the rate of change. Thus we take φ to be a 1-form ﬁeld, and likewise take u and v to be vector ﬁelds.
Let us begin by imagining that u is the direction in which we want to know the rate of change
of φ, the same role it played in df(u) = ∇uf. Since v is the only other vector in play, the function
whose rate of change will be sought can only be φ(v). In other words, we are essentially forced to
consider the rate of change along u of φ(v):
∇uφ(v).
We are off to a good start, but we require that dφ be a 2-form, so its action dφ(u, v) on pairs of
vectors must be antisymmetric in those vectors, which this expression is not. We therefore employ
a trick that should be very familiar by now: we impose antisymmetry, by subtracting the same
expression, but with u ↔v:
∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u).
(36.1)
This expression in now antisymmetric in the two vector inputs, so we are certainly getting closer,
but this still cannot be the correct answer.
The problem is that dφ is supposed to measure the rate of change (in all directions) of the
1-form φ—the vector ﬁelds u and v should have nothing to do with this. And yet, even before
we look into the matter in detail, it is clear that the variation of φ(v), for example, will depend on
both the variation of φ (which is the thing we care about) and on the variation of v (which we do
not care about).
In order to deﬁne the exterior derivative dφ, we must therefore discover how the variations
of u and v contribute to (36.1), and then we must surgically remove their unwanted contributions!
392

36.1 The Exterior Derivative of a 1-Form
•
393
In order to accomplish this, let us express the action of φ on a vector in terms of its vector
counterpart, φ, as we did in (34.15):
φ(u) = φ·u.
Then,
∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u)
=
∇u(φ·v) −∇v(φ·u)
=
{
v·∇uφ −u·∇vφ
}
+
{
φ·∇uv −φ·∇vu
}
=
{
v·∇uφ −u·∇vφ
}
+
{
φ·[u, v]
}
=
{
v·∇uφ −u·∇vφ
}
+ φ([u, v]),
where [u, v] is the commutator, pictured in [29.7], page 288.
The last term, φ
 [u, v]

, contains the variation in the vectors ﬁelds—this is what must be sur-
gically removed, leaving only the ﬁrst, bracketed term as our deﬁnition of the exterior derivative
dφ of φ.
Having used the vector correspondence as a stepping stone, we can now dispense with it,
and express the ﬁnal result purely in terms of the 1-form φ:
dφ(u, v) = ∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u) −φ
 [u, v]

.
(36.2)
One advantage of this formula is that it is geometrically deﬁned, independently of any choice
of basis and coordinates. However, we also perceive two problems with this formula, one aesthetic,
and one philosophical: (i) it is disappointingly complicated and (ii) it is very unclear what it means.
We shall address the ﬁrst problem immediately, and the second problem later in this chapter, and,
at a deeper level, in the next chapter.
The key to the simplifying (36.2) is to abstract the vectors away entirely, leaving behind the 2-
form dφ itself. Since we have gone to so much trouble to make (36.2) independent of the variations
of the vector ﬁelds, let us simply choose the vector ﬁelds to be constant, in which case their com-
mutator vanishes. Next, imagine that a basis has been chosen, enabling us to express the formula
in terms of the Cartesian basis 1-forms, {dxk}.
In this case, writing φ = φi dxi, and using the abbreviation Bk ≡Bxk, we ﬁnd that (36.2)
reduces to,
dφ(u, v)
=
∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u)
=
uiBi(vj φj) −viBi(uj φj)
=
uivj Biφj −ujvi Biφj
=
Biφj
{
dxi(u)dxj(v) −dxj(u)dxi(v)
}
=
Biφj (dxi ∧dxj)(u, v).
Therefore, abstracting away the arbitrary vector ﬁelds,
dφ = Biφj (dxi ∧dxj).
(36.3)
Much better!

394
•
Chapter 36 Differentiation
But we can do better still! Since df = Bif dxi, we now deduce the following elegant, natural-
looking, and highly practical expression for the action of d:
dφ = d
 φj dxj
= dφj ∧dxj.
(36.4)
36.2
The Exterior Derivative of a 2-Form and of a p-Form
The obvious next step is to try to discover the action of d on a 2-form, Ψ. This should be a 3-
form, taking three vector ﬁelds as inputs: v1, v2, v3. Clearly, dΨ(v1, v2, v3) should be built out of
elements such as ∇v1Ψ(v2, v3), but how?
Since d increases the degree of a form by 1, it is analogous to a 1-form. The answer to the
construction of dΨ(v1, v2, v3) can therefore be found in our earlier work on the construction of the
wedge product of a 1-form and a 2-form, as given in (35.2). Assuming constant vector ﬁelds from
the outset, we therefore ﬁnd that
dΨ(v1, v2, v3) = ∇v1Ψ(v2, v3) + ∇v2Ψ(v3, v1) + ∇v3Ψ(v1, v2).
Again, we can simplify this formula in a gratifying manner, by abstracting the vectors away
to reveal the 3-form itself. We ﬁnd [exercise] that (36.4) generalizes in a way that is clearly part of
a larger pattern:
dΨ = d

Ψij dxi ∧dxj
= dΨij ∧dxi ∧dxj.
(36.5)
It is now clear how d acts upon a p-form Φ to create a (p + 1)-form dΦ:

The key to understanding the general formula (36.8) is the passage from the fourth to the ﬁfth
line, in which we pushed dΨjk past dxi (belonging to ϕ) in order to return it to its rightful place,
next to its own dxj ∧dxk, obtaining
dxi ∧dΨjk = −dΨjk ∧dxi.
In the general case, we must push dΨjk past all the dxi’s belonging to Φ—numbering
deg Φ—resulting in deg Φ changes of sign. In other words, the sign of Φ ∧
 dΨ

is (−1)deg Φ,
which completes the proof.
A helpful way of remembering the general formula is to think of d as a 1-form. Then, before
d can reach Ψ, on the right of d
 Φ ∧Ψ

, it must push past all the 1-forms of Φ, resulting in deg Φ
changes of sign. As we have just seen, this mnemonic is actually quite close to the truth of the
matter!

By virtue of (36.6), it is clear that the above argument generalizes to arbitrary p-forms:
d2Φ = 0. We may therefore abstract the p-form away, obtaining this absolutely fundamental result:
Every form is annihilated by two applications of d:
d2 = 0.
(36.10)
The computational proof is certainly short and clear, but what does the result itself actually
mean? The resolution of this mystery must await our discussion of integration. (If you insist on
ruining the suspense, see Section 37.4.)
36.4.2
Closed and Exact Forms
A form is called closed if its exterior derivative vanishes:
Υ is closed
⇐⇒
dΥ = 0.
We shall eventually see that a closed form is a higher-dimensional analogue of the ﬂux 2-form of
an incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow.
A p-form is called exact if it is the exterior derivative of a (p −1)-form:
Υ is exact
⇐⇒
Υ = dΨ
(for someΨ).
In the language of physics, we call Ψ a potential for Υ. If such a potential exists, it is far from
unique, for if Θ is an arbitrary (p −2)-form, and we change
Ψ ù eΨ = Ψ + dΘ,
then [exercise] eΨ is also a potential: Υ = deΨ. This freedom in choosing the potential is called gauge
freedom, and the transformation Ψ ù eΨ is called a gauge transformation.
It follows immediately from (36.10) that
Every exact form is closed:
Υ = dΨ =⇒dΥ = 0
In light of this, it is very natural to ask about a possible converse: Is a closed form always exact? This
turns out to be a very interesting, deep question.
The short answer is that it depends on the topology of the region in which the form is deﬁned.
Poincaré Lemma. If dΥ = 0 throughout a simply connected region, then
Υ = dΨ, for some Ψ.
(36.11)
Thus a potential does always exist locally. But global problems arise if the region is not simply
connected, in which case it is possible that no such Ψ exists. The study of the closed Forms that are

not exact then encodes detailed information about the topology of the space, called the de Rham
cohomology. This is the subject of Section 37.9.
Let us end this subsection with some practice with these concepts. We ask that you prove to
yourself each of the following interesting facts:
If Υ and Φ are closed, then Υ ∧Φ is closed, too.
If Υ is closed, then Υ ∧dΦ is closed for all Φ.
If deg Φ is even, then Φ ∧dΦ is closed.
Hint: (35.4).

Complex Analysis: Cauchy–Riemann Equations
In VCA (pp. 216–217) we showed geometrically that a complex function f(z) = u + iv is locally an
amplitwist—as deﬁned in Section 4.6—if and only if
i Bxf = Byf.
(36.12)
Equating real and imaginary parts, we recover the more common form of the celebrated Cauchy–
Riemann equations, characterizing a conformal (aka complex analytic) mapping:
Bxu = Byv
and
Bxv = −Byu.
We now show that these equations may be elegantly (and consequentially) reformulated in the
language of Forms.

Cauchy’s Theorem!
The above formulation is valuable even if we are interested in complex functions that are not

fundamental operations and identities of Vector Calculus emerge automatically, as if by magic—
automagically!
As we explained in Sections 34.6 and 34.7, the exterior calculus works perfectly in all dimen-
sions and on all p-forms, but only in R3 can a 2-form masquerade as a vector, and only in R3 can
the wedge product of two 1-forms masquerade as the vector product of two vectors—these are
the twin spells that conjure Vector Calculus into existence!
First, we remind the reader of the notation: φ is the vector corresponding (⇄) to the 1-form
φ, and Ψ is the vector corresponding to the ﬂux 2-form Ψ, and V = dx1 ∧dx2 ∧dx3 is the volume
3-form.
We have seen that the Vector Calculus concept of the gradient vector ∇f corresponds to the
gradient 1-form df of the 0-form f. Now let us step up one level, and take the exterior derivative
of a 1-form, writing out explicitly the three resulting components of (36.3) that occur in R3; ﬁnally,
let us interpret the answer as the ﬂux 2-form of a ﬂow in space:
dφ
=
Biφj (dxi ∧dxj)
=
(B2φ3 −B3φ2) (dx2 ∧dx3) + (B3φ1 −B1φ3) (dx3 ∧dx1) + (B1φ2 −B2φ1) (dx1 ∧dx2)
⇄

B2φ3 −B3φ2
B3φ1 −B1φ3
B1φ2 −B2φ1

,
by virtue of (34.10).

Thus if φ is closed, meaning dφ = 0, then φ has vanishing curl: if φ is pictured as the velocity
of a ﬂuid ﬂow in space, then if we insert a tiny ball—not a point particle—into the ﬂow, it will be
carried off with velocity φ, but it will not spin. In this case the ﬂow is called irrotational. If dφ ̸= 0,
then the ball will spin, and curl φ points along the spin axis, and it magnitude gives double2 the
rate of spin. In this context, curl φ is called the vorticity vector.
Alternatively, we may picture the closed form as corresponding to a conservative force ﬁeld,
with the attendant advantage that the 1-form φ itself can immediately be given meaning, as the
work, exactly as in the gravitational example of Section 32.3.1. There, φ was closed by virtue of the
rather uninteresting reason that it was constant. In that gravitational case, the path-independent
work done transporting a particle along a path from p to q could therefore be obtained simply by
applying φ to the direct path along
−→
pq.
In accord with the Poincaré lemma, in this gravitational example, the closed 1-form φ is exact:
if h again represents height, so that gh is the potential energy of a unit mass, then φ = d(gh) = g dh.
This connects naturally with the classical expression g dh, for if the particle is raised δh by moving
it along the short vector v, then the work done is
g dh(v) = g δh.
As we will discuss in the next chapter, for a nonconstant φ, the work done along a path must
be evaluated by breaking the path down into lots of small vectors, applying φ to each one, and
summing. As we shall discuss, if φ is closed, then the work done in transporting a particle around
a closed loop vanishes.
Next, let us take the exterior derivative of a 2-form Ψ, but labelling its component with the
corresponding vector Ψ, as we did in (34.10):
Ψ = Ψ1 (dx2 ∧dx3) + Ψ2 (dx3 ∧dx1) + Ψ3 (dx1 ∧dx2)

Lo and behold, out has popped the divergence of the vector ﬁeld ﬂow corresponding to the
ﬂux 2-form! To summarize,
dΨ = (div Ψ) V = (∇·Ψ) V.
(36.16)
Thus if Ψ is closed, meaning dΨ = 0, then Ψ has vanishing divergence, corresponding to the
ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid in a region where no ﬂuid is being pumped in or sucked out, so
that exactly as much ﬂuid ﬂows out of a closed surface as ﬂows into it. In general, applying dΨ to

Chapter 36 Differentiation
a very small parallelepiped ultimately yields the net ﬂux of ﬂuid out of it. This will be explained in
the next chapter.
The fundamental identity of exterior differentiation is (36.10):
d2 = 0,
and this has important implications for vector ﬁelds in R3. If in (36.15) we take φ = df, then we
instantly obtain a classical result of Vector Calculus:
d2φ = 0
⇐⇒

= ∇× ∇f = 0.
If in (36.16) we take Ψ = dφ, then we instantly obtain a second classical result of Vector
Calculus:
d2 Ψ = 0
⇐⇒


∇× φ

= 0.
Working with Forms obviates the need to remember these identities, as well as the many more
complicated ones that are routinely employed by working scientists when using Vector Calculus.
Furthermore, if we do wish to employ such an identity, it may be derived using Forms, and often
much more quickly and elegantly than by direct vector methods. We illustrate this point with two
examples of differential identities, leaving others to Exercise 14.
First, however, we shall state a very useful algebraic link between the world of Forms and the
world of (R3) vectors, leaving the simple proof to you:
φ ∧Ψ = (φ·Ψ) V
(36.17)
As our ﬁrst example, suppose we wish to ﬁnd an identity for ∇·

we should therefore evaluate d

yielding the familiar identity,

f Ψ

= (∇f)·Ψ + f ∇·Ψ.
In this case, it is almost as easy [exercise] to derive the identity directly. So let us move on to an
example in which the advantages of Forms start to emerge clearly.
Suppose we wish to ﬁnd an identity for ∇×

As the complexity of the vector identity increases, so does the simplifying power of Forms;

36.6
Maxwell’s Equations
We end this chapter with a beautiful and profound application of the above ideas: the encapsulation
of Maxwell’s complete laws of electromagnetism in just two, supremely beautiful equations.
We begin with the source-free equations, (34.24), which we restate here, for your convenience:
∇·B
=
0,
∇× E + BtB
=
0.
Following the example of Baez and Muniain (1994, §5), let us use dS to denote the spatial part
of the spacetime exterior derivative, so that
df = dSf + Btf dt.
Now consider the exterior derivative of the Faraday 2-form, (34.22):
dF = d(ε ∧dt) + dB.
Let us evaluate these two terms separately.
First,
d(ε ∧dt)
=
d(ε) ∧dt
=
dS(ε) ∧dt
=
h
ﬂux 2-form of ∇× E
i
∧dt,
by virtue of (36.15).
Second,
dB
=
dSB +
h
BtBx dt ∧(dy ∧dz) + · · ·
i
=
(∇·B) V + dt ∧
h
BtBx (dy ∧dz) + · · ·
i
=
(∇·B) V + dt ∧BtB
by virtue of (36.16).
But dt ∧(BtB) = (BtB) ∧dt, by virtue of (35.3), because BtB is a 2-form. Therefore, since
BtB = ﬂux 2-form of BtB,
combining the previous two results yields
dF = (∇·B) V +
{
ﬂux 2-form of
h
∇× E + BtB
i}
∧dt.
Therefore, reaching upward, we may now touch the face of God:
Maxwell’s Source-Free Equations state that the Faraday 2-form is closed:
dF = 0.

402
•
Chapter 36 Differentiation
As we have stated, and will discuss further in the next chapter, locally, every closed form is
exact. In other words, there exists a 1-form3 potential, A, such that
F = dA.
NOTE: The classical literature on electrodynamics instead employs the corresponding vector ﬁeld
A, which is called the vector potential.
Next, we turn our attention to the second pair of Maxwell’s Equations, (34.25), which describe
the ﬁelds generated by sources—an electrical charge density ρ, and a current density j:
∇·E
=
4πρ,
∇× B −BtE
=
4π j.
In order to see what these equations are truly trying to show us, we must ﬁrst introduce the
spacetime version of the sources, combined into a single 1-form:
J = −ρ dt + j,
where the (spatial) 1-form4 j corresponds to the (spatial) vector current density j:
j =


j1
j2
j3


⇄
j = j1 dx1 + j2 dx2 + j3 dx3.
Thus when J acts on a purely spatial 4-vector, it yields the amount of current ﬂowing in that spatial
direction, but when it acts on the time-axis 4-velocity of a stationary observer, it describes the
charge ﬂowing with the observer in time, i.e., the charge density ρ at the observer’s location. More
generally, if u is the 4-velocity of an observer, then she measures the charge density to be J(u).
In Exercise 15 you will see that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the Hodge star operator (⋆) maps
a p-form to a dual (4 −p)-form. In particular, the dual of the source density 1-form J is the 3-form,
⋆J = −ρ V +
h
ﬂux 2-form of j
i
∧dt,
(36.18)
and the dual of the Faraday 2-form is the Maxwell 2-form, (34.26):
⋆F = Maxwell = β ∧dt −E.
Since Maxwell can be obtained from Faraday by interchanging the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, and changing the sign of the ﬁrst term, the entire calculation above of dF may be coopted to
simply write down the answer for d ⋆F:
d ⋆F
=
−(∇·E) V +
{
ﬂux 2-form of
h
∇× B −BtE
i}
∧dt
=
4π
h
−ρ V +
{
ﬂux 2-form of j
}
∧dt
i
,
by virtue of the two Maxwell source equations above.
3This notation is universal, so in this case we must abandon our convention of using lowercase Greek letters to represent
1-forms.
4This notation is universal, so, once again, we must abandon our convention of using lowercase Greek letters to represent
1-forms.

We have arrived at a very remarkable—and a very beautiful—conclusion:
The Maxwell 2-form is subject to this Law of
Nature:
d ⋆F = 4π ⋆J.

and Hubbard (2009, §6.11), Baez and Muniain (1994, §§1,5), and Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler

The Line Integral of a 1-Form
37.1.1
Circulation and Work
The circulation CK(φ) along a directed curve K of a ﬂuid ﬂow with velocity φ was previously
deﬁned ((27.2), p. 263) as the integral of the component of the ﬂuid ﬂow along K:
CK(φ) ≡
Z
K
φ·dr,
as illustrated in [37.1]. Alternatively, and equally importantly, we may think of φ as a force ﬁeld,
in which case exactly the same integral is now interpreted as the work done by the force ﬁeld in
moving a particle along K.





[37.1] The work done in moving a particle a distance
ds along the path K is φK ds, where φK is the
component of the force ﬁeld φ in the direction of K.
We have chosen to illustrate this idea
in R2 in order to keep things simple, but
we should stress that there is nothing intrin-
sically 2-dimensional about this concept:
imagine the ﬂuid to be the ocean, or the
force ﬁeld to be gravity. Indeed, everything
we are about to discuss applies (without
change) to 1-forms acting on vectors in Rn.
Translating this into the language of
Forms, we may write,
φ(dr) = φ·dr = φK ds.
Here, as illustrated in [37.1], φK is the pro-
jection of φ onto the direction of K, and
ds = |dr|. In other words, the 1-form φ acts
on a small piece1 dr of the directed curve,
yielding the component of the force in the direction of the movement, times the length of that
small movement, which is the work done in carrying out that movement. The complete integral
may then be thought of as the total work done, obtained by summing the increments of work, as
the 1-form φ eats its way along the directed curve K, one small dr bite at a time.
We stress that only the component of the force in the direction of movement does any work. Thus,
for example, if K were, instead, an orthogonal trajectory of the ﬁeld lines, then no work would be
done, i.e., the integral would vanish.
1Here we are being lazy: we should write δr, and use ultimate equalities.

37.1 The Line Integral of a 1-Form
•
405
Thought of in this way, we have arrived at our deﬁnition of the integral of 1-form φ along K,
written
Z
K
φ ≡CK(φ) ≡
Z
K
φK ds.
(37.1)
In this deﬁnition, the absence (on the left) of d (something) under the integral sign is unfamiliar
and perhaps disconcerting at ﬁrst: just remember that this is not needed, since it is understood that
φ is going to eat its way along K, one small dr bite at a time.
In the illustrated case, it is clear that K is always moving in roughly the same direction as
the ﬂow or force ﬁeld, so the integral is clearly positive. But suppose we traverse the same curve,
but in the opposite direction denoted −K. Now we are swimming upstream against the current, or,
using the other interpretation, we are pushing the particle against the resistance of the force ﬁeld.
Thus the integral is now negative. More precisely, since φ(−dr) = −φ(dr), it follows that

φ = −

37.1.2
Path-Independence ⇐⇒Vanishing Loop Integrals
1
2



[37.2] If the integral is independent of the path K
between a and b, then the integral around the closed
loop L vanishes. Conversely, if all loop integrals
vanish, then the integral is path-independent.
If K connects two ﬁxed points a and b, then,
in general, the value of CK(φ) will depend on
the speciﬁc path K from a to b that is chosen.
However, for many important physical ﬂuid
ﬂows and force ﬁelds, we have path indepen-
dence, which means what it says, and says
what it means: all paths K from a to b yield
the same value of the integral.
This concept can be rephrased in an
important and useful way. As illustrated in
[37.2], consider any two paths K1 and K2 con-
necting a to b. Then we can create a closed loop
L by ﬁrst travelling along K1 from a to b, and
then travelling back from b to a along −K2, so
that L = K1 −K2.
But then path-independence implies that
the loop integral vanishes:
Z
L
φ =
Z
K1−K2
φ =

K1
φ −

K2
φ = 0.
Conversely, suppose that we know that all loop integrals vanish. It follows that the integral
is path-independent. For if K1 and K2 are any two paths connecting a to b, then we may form the
closed loop L = K1 −K2, and the fact that CL(φ) = 0 then implies
Z
K1
φ =

Chapter 37 Integration
In brief,
Path-independence
⇐⇒
vanishing loop integrals.
(37.3)
Look again at [37.1], and imagine that we extend K so that it closes up to become an elliptical
loop encircling the vortex. Clearly the integral around this loop does not vanish, and is in fact posi-
tive. Thus here we have an example in which the integral of φ does depend on the path connecting
two points.
37.1.3
The Integral of an Exact Form: φ = df
If φ is exact then, by deﬁnition, φ = df, for some function f. If δr is a short, ultimately vanishing,
movement along the integration path K, then its contribution to the integral is
φ(δr) = df(δr) ≍δf ≡change in f from the tail to the tip of δr.
Thus the complete integral is imply the net change in f from the start of K to the end of K. To
summarize,
The integral of an exact 1-form φ = df is path-independent, and is given by the
change in f along K:
Z
K
df = f(b) −f(a).
(37.4)
In the language of physics, φ = df corresponds to a conservative force ﬁeld, φ = ∇f, and f is
the potential energy. Then the change in potential energy

f(b) −f(a)

is the path-independent
amount of work done by the force ﬁeld in carrying the particle from a to b, so (37.4) is simply
another way of writing the familiar fact that
Z
K
(∇f)·dr = f(b) −f(a).
(37.5)
As discussed by Feynman et al. (1963, Vol. 1, §14-4), at the most fundamental level all the
forces in Nature are conservative, in accordance with the fundamental principle of conservation of
energy.
37.2
The Exterior Derivative as an Integral
37.2.1
d(1-Form)
From our very ﬁrst exposure to calculus, we are taught that differentiation and integration are
inverse operations—this is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Indeed, we have just seen (or so
it would seem) a fresh instance of this idea in (37.4).
It may therefore come as disorienting shock to learn that, when it comes to Forms, exterior
differentiation is integration—around a small closed loop, or over a small closed surface—not its
inverse!

[37.3] The integral of the 1-form φ around the small
parallelogram Π is ultimately equal to its exterior
derivative, dφ, applied to the edges of Π.
Let Π(ϵu, ϵv) be the oriented bound-
ary of a small—ultimately vanishing, as ϵ
vanishes—parallelogram with ﬁrst edge ϵu
and second edge ϵv, as illustrated in [37.3].
Let us deﬁne Ω(ϵu, ϵv) to be the integral of
the 1-form φ around Π:
Ω(ϵu, ϵv) ≡
I
Π(ϵu,ϵv)
φ.
We will now show that this integral is a 2-
form, and not just any 2-form—it is the exterior
derivative of φ! That is,
Ω(ϵu, ϵv) ≍dφ(ϵu, ϵv).
Abstracting the vectors away,
Ω≍dφ.
(37.6)
That Ωdoes indeed possess the antisymmetry required of a 2-form follows immediately from
the fact that Π(ϵv, ϵu) = −Π(ϵu, ϵv), for this implies that
Ω(ϵv, ϵu) =
I
Π(ϵv,ϵu)
φ =
I
−Π(ϵu,ϵv)
φ = −
I
Π(ϵu,ϵv)
φ = −Ω(ϵu, ϵv).
It is also possible to conﬁrm geometrically that the linearity requirements are met, directly
from the deﬁnition, but we shall instead cut directly to the chase, proving the full result, (37.6),
thereby conﬁrming linearity, and (re)conﬁrming antisymmetry, in the process. To do so, we need
only generalize the argument we previously gave in [27.2], page 263.
First, however, let us try to picture a ﬂag ﬂying over our ultimate destination, so that we have
some idea in which direction we should march. In order for Π(ϵu, ϵv) to be a closed parallelogram
loop, it is necessary—as explained in [29.7], page 288, and again in the upcoming [37.4]—that the
commutator of its sides vanishes:
[ϵu, ϵv] = 0.
This is readily achieved by choosing the vector ﬁelds to be constant. In this event, our very ﬁrst
expression for the exterior derivative, (36.2), reduces to
dφ(ϵu, ϵv) = ∇ϵu φ(ϵv) −∇ϵv φ(ϵu),
(37.7)
and this is our ﬂag.
With our objective clear, let us return to the evaluation of the integral Ω(ϵu, ϵv). Since we will
ultimately shrink the parallelogram to nothing by letting ϵ go to zero, we may use a Riemann sum
with just a single term per side of the parallelogram. Usually a Riemann sum is used to evaluate
an integral along some ﬁxed interval, breaking it down into a larger and larger number of smaller
and smaller subintervals, so that the precise point at which we evaluate φ on each subinterval
becomes irrelevant in this limit.

408
•
Chapter 37 Integration
However, that is not what we are doing here: we seek the limiting form—pun intended—of
the integral as ϵ vanishes, and the integral vanishes with it. If we simply pick a random point on each
side, then the error dies away as ϵ2, and that is simply not good enough. For it is intuitively clear
that the contributions to Ωfrom opposite sides of Π will cancel to order ϵ, so that Ωitself will be
of order ϵ2—the same order as the error incurred in a random Riemann sum.
The answer is to instead choose the midpoints of the sides, for then the error incurred dies away
much faster—in fact as ϵ3. (This is proved geometrically in VCA, p. 382.) By using midpoints, we
therefore immediately attain the accuracy we require2 to ﬁnd a net result for Ωthat is of order ϵ2.
Therefore, as illustrated in [37.3], let us approximate Ω(ϵu, ϵv) using these midpoints, a, b, c,
d, and let the corresponding vector at a be φa, and so on, as illustrated. Then, taking all derivatives
to be evaluated at the centre of the parallelogram,
Ω(ϵu, ϵv)
≍
φa(ϵu) + φb(ϵv) + φc(−ϵu) + φd(−ϵv)
=

∇ϵu φ(ϵv) −∇ϵv φ(ϵu)
=
dφ(ϵu, ϵv),
by virtue of (37.7). Abstracting away the vectors, this completes the proof of (37.6).
We stress that there is nothing intrinsically 2-dimensional about the preceding argument: pic-
ture the φ vectors in [37.3] as sticking out of the page of the book, and pick up and tilt the book so
that Π takes up any position in space!
If we now think of the vector ﬁeld φ as a ﬂuid ﬂow in space, then the result (37.6) attaches a
wonderfully concrete and vivid meaning to the exterior derivative:
If ﬂuid ﬂows with velocity φ, then its circulation Ωaround a small (ultimately
vanishing) parallelogram is ultimately equal to the result of applying the ﬂux
2-form dφ to its edges.
(37.8)
For future use, let us express this crucial result as an explicit formula in the language of
classical Vector Calculus. Let bn be the unit normal to the parallelogram, its direction determined
by the right-hand rule, curling our ﬁngers from u to v. Also, let δA be the area of the parallelogram:
δA = |ϵ u × ϵ v|,
so that
ϵ u × ϵ v = bn δA.
The ﬂux of ∇× φ through the parallelogram is its component perpendicular to the parallelo-
gram (i.e., its component in the direction of bn) multiplied by the area of the parallelogram:
ﬂux ≍(∇× φ)·bn δA.
(37.9)
Then, combining (36.15), (37.8), and (37.9),
I
Π(ϵu,ϵv)
φ = Ω(ϵu, ϵv) ≍dφ(ϵu, ϵv) = (∇× φ)·bn δA.
(37.10)
2We ﬁrst used this reasoning in VCA (pp. 412–413) to provide a direct, geometrical proof of Cauchy’s Theorem.

37.2 The Exterior Derivative as an Integral
•
409
[37.4] General vector ﬁelds do not create a closed parallelogram. However, we may create a closed loop Π by
bridging the gap with the commutator: [ϵv,ϵu] = ∇ϵv ϵu −∇ϵuϵv.
We end with another bonus: a geometrical explanation of the original, full formula for the
exterior derivative, (36.2), including its formerly mysterious commutator term. Recall that we
ﬁrst arrived at the following formula for dφ by means of a purely formal calculation (albeit an
enlightened calculation):
dφ(u, v) = ∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u) −φ
 [u, v]

.
We chose to simplify the foregoing exposition by insisting on constant vector ﬁelds, but what
if u and v are not constant? Then, as illustrated in [37.4], the vector ﬁelds do not generally create a
closed loop. However, we may create a closed loop Π by bridging the gap with the commutator [ϵv, ϵu].
The bulk of the foregoing analysis goes through unchanged, but now the integral Ω(ϵu, ϵv) gains
one extra contribution from the gap-closing commutator edge:

d(2-Form)
Let us repeat the above analysis for the integral of a 2-form Ψ over the oriented 2-dimensional

In light of the 1-form result (37.6), we anticipate that this integral is a 3-form, and not just any

Ψ = Ω(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw) ≍dΨ(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw) = (∇·Ψ) V(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw),
by virtue of (36.16). So, abstracting the vectors away, we are led to believe that
Ω≍dΨ = (∇·Ψ) V.
(37.11)
This is indeed true, and the proof is simplest and most transparent in the case that the
edges of the parallelepiped (which we take to be centred at p) are orthogonal, directed along
the orthonormal basis vectors: {ϵ1 e1, ϵ2 e2, ϵ3 e3}, so that its volume is V = ϵ1ϵ2ϵ3.
As illustrated in [37.5], consider the ﬂux of Ψ through the two faces that are orthogonal to e1,
that are separated by distance ϵ1, and whose centres are a and b. Only the component Ψ1e1 carries
ﬂuid across these these faces; the other two components ﬂow parallel to the faces. (For the sake of
deﬁniteness, in this ﬁgure we have assumed that Ψ1 > 0.)
To evaluate the ﬂux out of the right-hand face, we multiply its area ϵ2ϵ3 by the orthogonal
component Ψ1(b) of the velocity at the centre of the face, so that
ﬂux out of right face ≍ϵ2ϵ3 Ψ1(b).
For the left-hand face, the outward-pointing normal bn = −e1 is opposite to the outward normal
of the right face, so
outward velocity of ﬂuid on left face = Ψ·bn = −Ψ1(a).
Therefore,
ﬂux out of left face = −(ﬂux into left face) ≍−ϵ2ϵ3 Ψ1(a).
Note that in [37.5] we have drawn Ψ1(a)e1 (dashed) with its arrowhead at a, both to declutter the
picture and to make it clear that this represents ﬂow into the box. Note that we have also drawn a
copy of Ψ1(a)e1 at b, to facilitate an upcoming comparsion to Ψ1(b)e1

The results (37.6) and (37.11) are part of a pattern that continues on into higher dimensions.
Though visualization fails us, it is nevertheless true that d(3-form) applied to a small, compact,
ultimately vanishing region of a 4-dimensional space yields the integral of the 3-form over its 3-
dimensional boundary, and so on. For more on these higher-dimensional results, see the Further

Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus
(Generalized Stokes’s Theorem)
37.3.1
Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus
All of the integral theorems you learned in Vector Calculus—(37.5), Green’s Theorem, Stokes’s
Theorem, and Gauss’s Theorem—are merely special cases of one elegant theorem about Forms.
The Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus:
Z
R
dΦ =
Z
BR
Φ
(37.12)
On the left, the (p + 1)-form dΦ is integrated over a compact (oriented) (p + 1)-dimensional region
R, and, on the right, the p-form Φ is integrated over the (oriented) p-dimensional boundary BR of
R. Note that we must dispense with multiple integral signs, instead using a single integral sign on
both sides of this equation, because the degree p is general and unknown.
WARNING: What we have called the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus (hereinafter,
FTEC) is instead called, in essentially all other books, the Generalized Stokes’s Theorem, often
abbreviated as GST.
37.3.2
Historical Aside
Unquestionably, Stokes made great contributions to science, but it is singularly inappropriate that
this theorem should bear his name, and his name alone. Vladimir Arnol’d (1989, p. 192) refers
to (37.12)—tongue-in-cheek—as the “Newton-Leibniz-Gauss-Green-Ostrogradskii-Stokes-Poincaré for-
mula”! But, out of this list, Stokes actually had the least to do with the theorem.
In 1854, Cambridge University’s Smith’s Prize examination was devised by Stokes. Ques-
tion number 8 asked the students to prove the original, pregeneralized result—the one we now
call Stokes’s Theorem; this was the very ﬁrst appearance of the result in print. One of the candi-
dates who sat for that examination was none other than James Clerk Maxwell—who tied for ﬁrst
place, by the way—and the initial naming of the theorem after Stokes likely stemmed from this
event!
But Stokes only knew of the result because William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) had sent it to him
in a letter, on the 2nd of July, 1850! But Kelvin seems to have been led to the result by studying
Green . . .! You begin to see what a pickle we are in; for extra pickles, see Katz (1979) and Crowe
(1985).

Chapter 37 Integration
An Alexandrian solution to this Gordian Knot of a naming conundrum was proposed by
N.M.J. Woodhouse to Roger Penrose: jettison all these names, and call it instead the Fundamen-
tal Theorem of Exterior Calculus. That is the solution adopted in Penrose and Rindler (1984), and
subsequently in Penrose (2005), and we hereby follow those precedents.
As for the history of the general result, (37.12), we shall only say this: the ﬁrst complete state-
ment occurred in a lecture course delivered by Cartan in Paris in 1936–1937, in which he explicitly
pointed out that all the results of Vector Calculus were special cases; these lectures ﬁrst appeared
in print in Cartan (1945).

As illustrated in [37.6], in R2 consider the

Let us evaluate the contributions to the
integral from the illustrated matching pair of
movements δr1 and δr2 sandwiched between the
horizontal lines at heights y and y + δy:
(x dy)(δr1) + (x dy)(δr2) = (x1 −x2) δy ≍δA.
Thus,

(Check that this argument continues to work

This also makes physical sense. According to the correspondence (34.10), dx ∧dy corresponds

region of area A is equal to A.

The Boundary of a Boundary Is Zero!
Before we prove the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus—or FTEC—let us see how it
resolves a mystery we have been living with for some time: why is d2 = 0? The computational proof
of this fundamental result was short and easy (see Section 36.4.1), but what does the result itself
actually mean?!

[37.7] The boundary of a boundary is zero: B2 = 0.
Let us explain this in 3-2-1 dimensions.
Consider [37.7], which shows a right-handed, 3-
dimensional parallelepiped with edges {v1, v2,
v3}. Its boundary consists of six 2-dimensional
faces, with indicated orientations. Finally, the
boundary of the boundary consists of 12 edges,
each of which is traversed once in one direction, and
once in the opposite direction.
Thus,
as
illustrated,
we
see
that
the
1-dimensional boundary of the 2-dimensional
boundary of the 3-dimensional solid is indeed
zero!
For an explanation in 4-3-2 dimensions and
beyond, see Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973,
§15). As they explain, but we shall not, this is
also the key to understanding the Differential
Bianchi Identity, (29.17).
37.5
The Classical Integral Theorems of Vector Calculus
Of course the above geometrical explanation of d2 = 0 hinges on FTEC, and we have yet to explain
why that is true! But before we offer a proof of FTEC, we shall ramp up the suspense still further, in
order to convince you that the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus truly is “Fundamental”!
To that end, we now verify our earlier claim that this single theorem contains all of the classical
theorems of Vector Calculus as special cases.
37.5.1
Φ = 0-Form
Taking Φ = f to be a function (0-form) in FTEC, dΦ = df is a 1-form, so R must be taken to be
a 1-dimensional curve K, and its boundary BK must be taken to be its end points, say, a and b.
Since K points at b and points away from a, we count the arrival point as +b, and the departure
point as −a. Then FTEC yields the previously established (37.4), and its classical vector equivalent
(37.5):

37.5.2
Φ = 1-Form
Taking Φ = φ to be a 1-form in FTEC, dΦ = dφ is the ﬂux 2-form of the vector ﬁeld ∇× φ, so R
must be taken to be a an oriented 2-dimensional surface S, and its boundary BS must be taken to
be its 1-dimensional boundary curve.
Let us begin with the simplest case, and historically ﬁrst case, in which the surface S is simply
a planar region R of the (x, y)-plane, exactly as in our area example above, [37.6]. Here the vector
ﬁeld is also planar, so that the 1-form is given by
φ = φx dx + φy dy.
Then the corresponding ﬂux 2-form is
dφ
=
dφx ∧dx + dφy ∧dy
=
Byφx dy ∧dx + Bxφy dx ∧dy
=

A.
According to (34.10), this dφ corresponds to a ﬂow in the z-direction, orthogonal to the
(x, y)-plane, with velocity
 Bxφy −Byφx

. According to FTEC, its ﬂux through R is equal to the
circulation of φ around BR. In other words, if we begin and end with classical notation, we see
that FTEC implies Green’s Theorem:3

This is a generalized version of the area example in [37.6].
Turning now to the case of a more general, curved surface S in space, let bn be the unit normal
to surface, the choice of direction being determined by the orientation of the surface via the right-
hand rule. Then, by virtue of (37.9), FTEC yields Stokes’s Theorem:

This theorem provides the crucial bridge between the macroscopic electromagnetic phenom-
ena that Faraday observed in his laboratory, and the microscopic differential equations to which
Maxwell ultimately reduced them mathematically.
3Green never actually wrote down the 2-dimensional formula that now bears his name, but it is a logical consequence of a
3-dimensional formula that he did discover. The ﬁrst known publication of Green’s Theorem (but without any proof) was by
Cauchy, in 1846. See Katz (1979).

37.6 Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus
•
415
Take Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which Faraday discovered in 1831:
If the surface S spans a loop of wire BS, and the ﬁeld lines of a varying magnetic
ﬁeld pass through it, then an electromotive force is induced in the loop that is equal
to the negative of the rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux through S.
Expressed in mathematical form,

But then Stokes’s Theorem allows us to re-express this as

∇× E + BtB
i·bn dA = 0.
But if this is to be true for all surfaces S, then the integrand itself must vanish, and we thereby ﬁnd
that Faraday’s Law of 1831 is equivalent to one of Maxwell’s equations of 1873:
∇× E + BtB = 0.
(37.13)
37.5.3
Φ = 2-Form
If we take Φ = Ψ to be a ﬂux 2-form in FTEC, then, by virtue of (37.11), dΨ = (∇·Ψ) V is the
3-form describing the source density. Now R must be taken to be a an oriented volume V, and
its boundary S = BV must be taken to be its 2-dimensional boundary surface. So, if we begin
and end with classical notation, we see that FTEC implies Gauss’s Theorem, also known as the
Divergence Theorem:

Proof of the Fundamental Theorem
of Exterior Calculus
We shall prove the 2-dimensional form (Stokes’s Theorem) of FTEC, and we shall also extend
the proof (essentially unchanged) to the 3-dimensional case (Gauss’s Theorem). But we shall
not develop the concepts, terminology, and notation required to explicitly extend the proof, in
a uniform manner, to all dimensions. For that, see the Further Reading section at the end of this
book.
Consider [37.8], which shows a region R of the (x, y)-plane divided up into small (ulti-
mately vanishing) parallelograms, each of which has ﬁrst edge ϵu and second edge ϵv. The
orientation associated with this ordering is indicated by the swirl within each cell. Note that the
parallelograms abutting the boundary BR are cut off into irregular shapes.
Now let us sum the integrals of the 1-form φ around all of the parallelograms and truncated
parallelograms into which R has been divided. We shall collectively refer the parallelograms and
the cut-off parallelograms as the cells of R.
Consider the illustrated, black, interior parallelogram, and the four white copies that abut it.
Every black edge is matched with an oppositely directed white edge of a neighbouring cell, and
so the integrals along these two edges cancel. The only edges that are not cancelled are the small
pieces of the boundary, BR, such as the illustrated δr. Therefore,

One might naively guess that the integral around each cell should be of order ϵ, since each
edge is of that order. But that cannot be correct, as one can see from the following rough argument.
y

∂R
R
[37.8] The circulations along the edges of the interior, black
parallelogram are all cancelled by the oppositely directed
edges of the abutting white parallelograms. Summing over all
cells, the only surviving contributions are from the uncancelled
boundary edges, such as the illustrated δr.
We know that for a general 1-
form, the integral round BR—hence
the sum (37.15)—will be nonzero and
ﬁnite. This leads us to believe that
each term must die away with the
reciprocal dependence on ϵ as gov-
erns the growth of the number of
terms in the series. But the num-
ber of terms grows as (ﬁxed area of
R, divided by the area of each cell)—
that is, as (1/ϵ2). Thus the magni-
tude of each term is expected to die
away as ϵ2. If our original guess had
been correct, the order of the sum
in (37.15) would have been ϵ(1/ϵ2),
yielding an inﬁnite result as the par-
allelograms shrunk. Conversely, any
contributions to the terms involving
powers of ϵ greater than two, cannot
have any inﬂuence on the ﬁnal result.
In fact, there is no need to appeal
to such rough reasoning, because we previously derived the precise result (37.8) governing the
integral of φ around such a shrinking parallelogram, and this is the key to understanding and
proving FTEC. We see that, as anticipated, the contribution from each parallelogram is indeed of
order ϵ2, and is given by the application of the 2-form dφ to the edges of the parallelogram. Thus,
(37.15) becomes
I
BR
φ =
X
cells in R
dφ(ϵu, ϵv).
But, in the limit that ϵ vanishes, this sum is precisely the deﬁnition of the integral of dφ over R,
thereby completing our proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus:
I
BR
φ =
ZZ
R
dφ.
Now let us generalize this argument to prove the Stokes’s Theorem form of FTEC. To do so,
we need only suppose that the region R upon which our parallelograms are drawn is actually a
rubber membrane, spanning a stiff but bendable wire, BR. We may now deform this wire BR out
of R2 into space, so that R takes up the form of some curved surface in R3. We may then further
deform the surface R as we please, while leaving the boundary wire in place.
The two critical ingredients of the above proof were the cancellation of all interior edges,
and (37.8). Both of these remain true in this new 3-dimensional context, the latter taking the form
(37.10):
I
Π(ϵu,ϵv)
φ ≍dφ(ϵu, ϵv) = (∇× φ)·bn δA.
Thus we have proved the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus in this case, thereby also
proving Stokes’s Theorem in the process:

Finally, let us step up a dimension to see why the above proof of FTEC goes through essen-
tially unchanged, and yields, in the process, a proof of Gauss’s Theorem. Let V be a compact region
of R3 with boundary surface S = BV. Now ﬁll V into parallelepipeds with edges {ϵu, ϵv, ϵw}, and
volume V(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw). The ones at the surface are truncated, just as happened with the parallelo-
grams of [37.8]. Again, let us collectively refer the interior parallelepipeds and truncated ones at
the surface as the cells of V.
Now consider the ﬂux of the 2-form Ψ out of an interior cell. Each of its faces is also the
face of a neighbouring cell, of opposite orientation: the outward normal of our cell points into the
neighbouring cell. Thus if we sum the ﬂuxes out of all the cells, the ﬂuxes of all the interior faces
cancel: physically, the ﬂuid that ﬂows out of a face ﬂows into its neighbour. Thus the only faces
that are not cancelled are those comprising part of the boundary surface, and therefore,
£
BV
Ψ =
X
cells in V

B(cell)
Ψ.
But we know from (37.11) that the ﬂux out of a small, ultimately vanishing parallelepiped is
ultimately of order ϵ3 and is obtained by applying the 3-form dΨ to its edges:
£
Π(ϵu,ϵv,ϵw)
Ψ ≍dΨ(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw) = (∇·Ψ) V(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw),
Thus,
£
BV
Ψ ≍
X
cells in V
dΨ(ϵu, ϵv, ϵw).
Finally, as ϵ vanishes, the right-hand side becomes the integral of dΨ over V. Thus we have proved
the Fundamental Theorem of Exterior Calculus in this case.
Beginning and ending with the notation of classical Vector Calculus, we have also proved
Gauss’s Theorem in the process:

Cauchy’s Theorem
Suppose that the region R depicted in [37.8] resides not in R2 but in the complex plane, and that a
complex function f(z) is analytic throughout it, so that its local geometric effect is an amplitwist.
Then, as we saw in (36.13), page 397, the fact that f(z) is locally an amplitwist is equivalent to the
statement that the 1-form f dz is closed: d

vanishing) connecting vector between them be ϵv = −−→

the two points is
δf = f(p2) −f(p1) ≍df(ϵv).
But, as illustrated in [37.9], if K1 is a path from o to p1, and K2 is a path from o to p2, then
−K1 + K2 is a path from p1 to p2. And since

A Primer on de Rham Cohomology
37.9.1
Introduction
What if the region R is not simply connected? Then it turns out that a closed Form need not be
exact, and the study of the Forms that are closed but not exact yields detailed information on the
topology of R.
This information is encoded in what are called the de Rham cohomology groups, Hk(R),
named after Georges de Rham (1903–1990), who discovered them in 1931. Here k refers to k-forms
deﬁned on R that are closed but not exact.
We will only provide a small taste of the subject, beginning with the 1-forms that are closed
but not exact, yielding the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group, H1(R).
37.9.2
A Special 2-Dimensional Vortex Vector Field
In R2, with polar coordinates (r, θ), consider the special circular, counterclockwise vortex4 centred
at the origin, shown in [37.10], in which the speed of the ﬂow is chosen to be |φ| = (q/2πr), where
q is a constant that measures the strength of the vortex. The reason for this special choice will be
revealed in just a moment.
As we approach the origin, the speed goes to inﬁnity, so the origin is a singularity, and we
exclude this one point: the ﬂow is deﬁned in the punctured plane, R2 −origin.
Since the speed along the circle Kr of radius r is (q/2πr), and the length of Kr is 2πr, the
circulation around it is
C =
I
Kr
φ = q,
independent of the radius r. Indeed, it was precisely in order to make the circulation independent
of the radius that we needed to choose the speed of the ﬂow to be inversely proportional to the
radius.
The mere fact that C ̸= 0 implies that
The 1-form φ of the vortex cannot be exact: φ ̸= df, for any f.
Nevertheless, in a moment we will show that
The 1-form φ of the vortex is closed: dφ = 0.
The existence of such a 1-form, that is closed but not exact, is made possible by the puncturing of
the plane. A loop that encircles the vortex’s singularity at the origin cannot be shrunk to a point
without crossing the origin, so the punctured plane is not simply connected, and therefore there is
no conﬂict with the Poincaré Lemma.
4Here we prefer the more evocative word vortex over the more technically precise term centre. See [19.4], page 200.

but since this has length r = |r|, we must multiply it by (q/2πr2). Thus the 1-form of the vortex is φ = (q/2πr2)

. The origin is a singularity of inﬁnite speed, and must be excluded.
37.9.3
The Vortex 1-Form Is Closed
Figure [37.10] shows a typical radius vector r of length r, which is then rotated by (π/2) to obtain a
vector in the direction of the vortex ﬂow. But this vector has length r, whereas we wish to construct
a vortex that has speed (q/2πr), so we must multiply this vector by (q/2πr2).
Expressed as a 1-form, the vortex vector ﬁeld is therefore

Geometrical Meaning of the Vortex 1-Form
We presented the above calculation in order to provide useful practice with the mechanics of exte-
rior differentiation. However, this calculation is actually unnecessary, for it is possible to instead
give a simple geometrical reason why φ is closed.

[37.11] The area δA of the shaded triangle can
be evaluated via the determinant of its edges,
yielding δA = 1
2(−y δx + x δy), or geometrically
from the ﬁgure, yielding δA ≍1
2r2 δθ. Equating
these expressions, we ﬁnd that the vortex 1-form is
φ = q
2π dθ.
Consider [37.11], which shows a short,

equal to the area of the triangle with base r

The vortex 1-form (37.17) therefore has a beautifully simple geometrical meaning:
φ = q
2π dθ,
making it crystal clear why φ is closed: dφ = q
2π d2θ = 0.
But wait—wasn’t the entire point of this example that φ is not exact? Sweet baby Newton,
what the dickens is going on here?!
The resolution of this appararent paradox is somewhat subtle. Although dθ has a perfectly
well-deﬁned geometrical meaning, it cannot be interpreted as (d of θ), because θ is not even a
function! Which is to say, any given point must be assigned inﬁnitely many angles.
If we restrict our attention to a simply connected region S that does not contain the singularity
at the origin, such as the one shown in [37.12], then we may (nonuniquely) deﬁne a genuine,
single-valued angle function θ on S, with θ1 ⩽θ ⩽θ2, as illustrated. Now the Poincaré Lemma
applies, so the closed 1-form φ must be exact, and we already know the explicit formula: φ =
q
2π dθ.
Furthermore, the circulation of the vortex around any loop L contained within S does indeed
vanish. For, as the illustrated particle traverses L, the position vector r rocks back and forth, but
when it returns to its starting point, the net change in its angle θ is zero, so C =
H
L
q
2π dθ = 0.
But if we attempt to do this in the entire punctured plane, then we immediately run into
trouble. Yes, we can try to deﬁne θ by insisting that 0 ⩽θ < 2π, for example, but then θ is not even
continuous, let alone differentiable. Thus it is the global topology of the region on which φ is
deﬁned that prevents it from being exact throughout that region.
37.9.5
The Topological Stability of the Circulation of a Closed 1-Form
We previously saw that the circulation C =
H
Kr φ of our special vortex was independent of the size
of the circle Kr, and the new geometric interpretation of φ makes it obvious why: as we traverse
any Kr, the angle increases by 2π, and therefore
R2π
0
q
2π dθ = q.
Indeed, this geometrical interpretation makes it clear that the size-independence of C is in
fact a very special case of a far more general phenomenon: if we gradually deform such a circle
into any shape whatsoever, but being careful not to make it cross the singularity at the origin as it
evolves, then the value of the integral does not change!

[37.12] The simply connected region S does not contain the origin, so we we may deﬁne a single-valued angle
function θ on it, where θ1 ⩽θ ⩽θ2. Then φ = q
2π dθ is exact on S. As r traces the loop L, it rocks back and
forth, but when it returns to its starting point, the net change in the angle θ is zero, so C =
H
L
q
2π dθ = 0.
In other words,
All simple loops that enclose the vortex’s singularity at the origin have the
same circulation, C = q. On the other hand, any loop that does not enclose the
singularity has vanishing circulation: C = 0.
(37.18)
[37.13] The simply connected region S does not contain
the singularity of the closed dipole ﬁeld χ. The Poincaré
Lemma then tells us that
H
L χ is invariant under the
deformation of l into el.
Observe that the distinction between these
two kinds of loops is purely topological.
NOTE: If a loop goes around the origin
m times, then one says that it has wind-
ing number m, in which case C = mq. For
much more on the concept of the wind-
ing number, and its many applications, see
VCA.
In fact, the topological stability of the
integral, as expressed in (37.18), is true of
all closed 1-forms, not just our speciﬁc vor-
tex. To understand this broader result, con-
sider the dipole ﬁeld χ shown in [37.13],
assumed to be closed: dχ = 0. There is no
special signiﬁcance to this particular ﬁeld;
we simply wish to make it clear that we
may apply the following reasoning to any
closed 1-form.
Now let S be any simply connected region that does not contain the singularity at the
origin, such as the shaded region shown in [37.13]. Since χ is closed within S, the Poincaré
Lemma implies that χ = df is exact within S, and hence its integral is path-independent
within S.
Now, as illustrated, consider an origin-centred circle L, part of which is contained in S. If we
take the illustrated arc l (connecting a to b) and deform it into the alternative route el, then the
path-independence tells us that

Thus if eL denotes the new deformed loop, in which l has been deformed into el, then

It is intuitively clear (and we prove it in VCA) that we may now continue deforming L into any
simple loop around the singularity, and since the circulation does not change throughout this
deformation, we have proved the generalized version of (37.18):
Deformation Theorem for Closed 1-Forms. The circulation (called the
(de Rham) period) of a closed 1-form along a loop is invariant under a
continuous deformation of the loop.
(37.19)
Given this independence of the circulation from the speciﬁc shape of the loop encircling the
singularity, we are entitled to think of it as being a property of the singularity itself. This is a gen-
eralization of the concept in Complex Analysis of the residue of a complex analytic function f(z)
at each of its singularities. Indeed, in VCA (Ch. 11) we explicitly describe residues in terms of the
circulation and ﬂux of the Pólya vector ﬁeld, f(z).
37.9.6
The First de Rham Cohomology Group
Now let us return to the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group, for the current case,
R = (R2 −origin), written H1(R2 −origin). An element of this group is not an individual 1-form,
rather it is an equivalence class of 1-forms, in which
Two 1-forms are considered fundamentally the same, “equivalent,” if they have
the same circulation around all loops.
(NOTE: The technical terminology (which we shall not employ) is to say that the two 1-forms are
cohomologous.)
For example, suppose we add to the vortex 1-form φ a constant 1-form, corresponding to
a steady ﬂow in some direction, which itself clearly has no circulation around any loop. Then
the circulation of the new ﬂow is the sum of the circulation of the old ﬂow and the circulation
of the steady ﬂow (which vanishes). Therefore, the circulation is unaltered around all loops, and
therefore this new 1-form belongs to the same equivalence class as φ.
More generally, we may add any ﬂow that has vanishing circulation around all loops. In other
words, we may add any 1-form that is exact. To sum up,
Let eφ ∼φ denote the equivalence of the 1-forms eφ and φ. Then,
eφ ∼φ
⇐⇒
eφ −φ = df,
for some f.
Each equivalence class is deﬁned by its value of the circulation, C. (NOTE: In standard texts on
de Rham cohomology, the circulation C is called the period of the equivalence class, and the class
itself is called a cohomology class.)

Chapter 37 Integration
TERMINOLOGY WARNING: Historically, the use of the term period in this context stems from
the theory of elliptic integrals. But in physics we are accustomed to the period referring to the time
it takes for a pendulum to swing back and forth, or the time it takes for a planet to go once around
the Sun. In looking at [37.10], we should therefore warn you that the de Rham period has nothing to
do with the time it takes for a particle of ﬂuid to perform one orbit around the singularity. Indeed,
the time Tr it takes to go once around Kr depends on r, and is given by Tr = 4π2(r2/q), whereas the
ﬁxed de Rham period is C = q.
All of the above reasoning only depended on FTEC, not on the speciﬁc form of the vortex
with which we chose to illustrate the idea. Thus it all carries through to more general 1-forms φ
that are closed but not exact.
If we add two such 1-forms, φ1 and φ2, from two different equivalence classes, then we obtain
a new 1-form from the class that has period
C(φ1 + φ2) = C(φ1) + C(φ2).
Thus, the group H1(R2 −origin) is isomorphic to the set of real periods under addition, and we
may simply write
H1(R2 −origin) = R.
Next, suppose we step up a dimension and consider 1-forms in R3. If we remove the origin
from R3 then we can contract every loop to a point, because now we have enough room to slip a
contracting loop around the origin, without having to pass through it—so now the space is simply
connected again. Thus there are no closed 1-forms that are not exact, and we record this fact as
H1(R3 −origin) = 0.
(37.20)
On the other hand, if we remove the entire z-axis (for example) from R3 then we have the ana-
logue of the punctured R2: it is not simply connected. Indeed, to deepen the analogy, imagine the
ﬂow [37.10] extending upward out of the page, creating a 3-dimensional vortex swirling around
the z-axis, with the ﬂuid rotating in concentric cylinders centred on the singular z-axis, where the
velocity goes to inﬁnity. Indeed, the analogy with the punctured plane is perfect:
H1(R3 −z-axis) = R.
37.9.7
The Inverse-Square Point Source in R3
As a prelude to our discussion of the second de Rham cohomology group, H2(R), we now deﬁne
a special vector ﬁeld with a singularity at the origin of R3. Let br be the unit radial vector:

We now present to you perhaps the single most important vector ﬁeld in all of physics, the inverse-
square point source:
Ψ = q
4π
br
r2 ,
where q is a constant that determines the strength of the ﬁeld. Since the ﬁeld has a singularity at
the origin, this point must be excluded: the ﬁeld is deﬁned on R3 −origin.
This ﬁeld has (at least!) three very important, physically distinct interpretations:
•
If ﬂuid is pumped into 0 at rate q, and ﬂows radially and symmetrically outward, then Ψ is
the velocity of the ﬂuid ﬂow.
•
If a point electric charge q sits at 0, Coulomb’s Law says that Ψ is its electric ﬁeld.
•
If we reverse the direction of the ﬁeld, then Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation says that
−Ψ is the attractive gravitational ﬁeld of the point mass q located at 0.
As Newton proved in the Principia, this ﬁeld also represents (very remarkably!) the ext-
ernal gravitational ﬁeld of any spherically symmetric body of mass q, such as the Earth or
the Sun.
In R3 we may interpret any vector ﬁeld as either a 1-form or a 2-form. Our focus in the next
section will be on the 2-form, but ﬁrst let us discuss the 1-form ψ corresponding to the vector
ﬁeld Ψ:
ψ =
q
4πr3
 x dx + y dy + z dz

.
Let us view this in terms of the third physical interpretation: gravity. Then instead of thinking
of the line integral along an open path J as representing circulation, we should now think of it
representing work:
WJ = work =
Z
J
ψ.
We know that the gravitational force is conservative: carrying a mass around a loop within this
gravitational ﬁeld must result in zero net work, or else we could construct a perpetual motion
machine! Thus we anticipate that ψ is closed. We leave it as an exercise to conﬁrm by direct
calculation that, indeed, dψ = 0.
However, we can instead demonstrate this by showing that ψ is exact: ψ = df. More explicitly,
let us show that the potential energy is
f = potential energy = −q
4πr.
As a lemma, ﬁrst observe [exercise] that

Note that, unlike our previous vortex example, here the potential f is a well-deﬁned function
throughout (R3 −origin). Thus this result is in keeping with the claim, (37.20), that the ﬁrst de
Rham cohomology group is trivial in this case.
37.9.8
The Second de Rham Cohomology Group
Next, let us calculate a speciﬁc example of the second de Rham cohomology group, H2(R), which
measures the 2-forms on R that are closed but not exact. Let us stay in R3, and consider the ﬂux of
a closed 2-form Ψ out of a closed surface S.
Let us continue thinking about the inverse-square point source, deﬁned on R = (R3 −origin),
but let us now switch to thinking of it as a ﬂuid ﬂow, in which case it is natural to represent the
ﬁeld as a ﬂux 2-form, via (34.10) and (34.12):
Ψ = q

That this ﬁeld cannot be exact can be seen by looking at the ﬂux out of an origin-centred
sphere Sr of radius r. The sphere has area 4πr2, and the ﬁeld is orthogonal to it, so the ﬂux Ωis
simply the product of the area and the ﬁeld strength:
Ω=

Next, let us show that (37.21) generalizes:
Deformation Theorem for Closed 2-Forms. The ﬂux (period) of a closed
2-form out of a closed 2-surface is invariant under a continuous deformation of
the surface.
(37.21)
Figure [37.14] shows ﬂuid ﬂowing radially outward through the sphere S from the inverse-
square point source at the origin. A circular patch of S is deformed outward—indicated by
squiggly arrows—to create the illustrated bump or blister on the surface of S.
All the ﬂuid that ﬂows into the base of the blister also ﬂows out of its outer surface, so if eS
denotes the new deformed surface, then,
£
eS
Ψ =
£
S
Ψ.
[37.14] Because the 2-form is closed, what ﬂows into the
blister must ﬂow out. So the ﬂux out of S is invariant
under deformations.
This argument easily generalizes to
apply to any closed 2-form Ψ. Since dΨ = 0
within the blister, FTEC implies that the
net outﬂux from it vanishes. But this can be
rephrased as we just did: what ﬂows into
the blister must ﬂow out. Thus we have
proved (37.21): the ﬂux out of S is invari-
ant under deformations of S that do not
force it to pass through a singularity of Ψ.
Returning to the speciﬁc inverse-
square point source, a closed surface
enclosing the singularity at the origin
cannot be contracted to a point without
crossing the origin, so all surfaces con-
taining the singularity have the same ﬂux
q. This topologically stable ﬂux measures
the strength of the source at the origin,
which has the three physically distinct
interpretations listed above. (Again, we
repeat that more advanced texts on de
Rham cohomology theory call this source
strength the period.)
The deﬁnition of equivalence classes of 2-forms is completely analogous to that for 1-forms;
that is, two 2-forms eΨ and Ψ are equivalent if they have the same ﬂux out of every closed surface.
Expressed in more conventional terms,
eΨ ∼Ψ
⇐⇒
eΨ −Ψ = dϕ,
for some 1-form ϕ.
If we add two 2-forms then their ﬂuxes add, too. So,
H2(R3 −origin) = R.

37.9.9
The First de Rham Cohomology Group of the Torus
What if the nonexact, closed Forms are deﬁned on a manifold other than Rn, such as closed
2-surface of genus g?
[37.15] The loop L1 around the equator of the torus, and the
loop L2 through the hole of the torus, are topologically dis-
tinct: we cannot deform one into the other. The equivalence
class of a closed 1-form ﬂow on the torus therefore requires
the speciﬁcation of two independent periods.
Consider
the
torus
shown
in
[37.15]. Here we see two different pos-
sible ﬂows on the surface: the white
ﬂow λ goes around the axis of sym-
metry of the torus, in the direction
the equator(s), while the black ﬂow
σ goes through the hole. We shall
assume that both ﬂows are closed:
dλ = 0 = dσ.
Now let L1 be a closed loop
streamline of the white ﬂow λ, and
let L2 be a closed-loop streamline of
the black ﬂow σ, as illustrated. As we
discussed in connection with [19.9],
L1 and L2 are topologically distinct:
we cannot continuously deform one
into the other. However, any loop that
goes once around the axis of symme-
try (and zero times through the hole)
is topologically equivalent to L1, and any loop that goes once through the hole (and zero times
around the axis of symmetry) is topologically equivalent to L2.
Next, observe that neither of these ﬂows can be exact. Since the white vector ﬁeld λ1 ﬂows
directly along L1, it has a nonzero circulation along it. Let us call this period ω1(λ), the subscript
identifying which of the topologically distinct loops is being considered:
ω1(λ) =
I
L1
λ ̸= 0.
The Deformation Theorem (37.19) then tells us that this period will be the same for any loop
into which we may deform L1. That is, the period ω1(λ) is a topological property of the white
vector ﬁeld, associated with any loop that goes once around the axis of symmetry (and zero times
through the hole).
On the other hand, λ is everywhere orthogonal to L2, so it has zero circulation along it:
ω2(λ) =
I
L2
λ = 0.
Furthermore, by the Deformation Theorem, this will be true of any loop that goes once through
the hole (and zero times around the axis of symmetry).
A completely symmetrical analysis applies to the black vector ﬁeld σ through the hole:
ω1(σ) =
I
L1
σ = 0,
and
ω2(σ) =
I
L2
σ ̸= 0,
and again these are true of any loops into which L1 and L2 may be deformed.

[37.16] The equivalence class of a closed 1-form ϕ on the
torus is determined by two independent, topological periods:
the circulation ω1(ϕ) around the axis of symmetry, and the
circulation ω2(ϕ) through the hole. Courtesy of RokerHRO,
CC by SA 3.0.
Now consider a more general
vector ﬁeld ϕ on the torus, obtained
by taking a linear combination of λ
and σ:
ϕ = aλ + bσ,
(37.22)
where a and b are constants. This
both ﬂows through the hole and
around the axis of symmetry, as
illustrated in [37.16]. But it is still
closed, because
dϕ = a dλ + b dσ = 0,
and thus its periods are still topolog-
ically deﬁned.
But unlike either of the ﬁelds
from which it was built, ϕ has two
nonvanishing, independent periods:
ω1(ϕ)
=
a ω1(λ) ̸= 0,
ω2(ϕ)
=
b ω2(σ) ̸= 0.
This characterization of ϕ by two independent periods also applies to a completely general
closed 1-form on the torus, even if ϕ doesn’t happen to have the special form (37.22). To sum up,
The equivalence class of a closed 1-form ϕ on the torus is determined by two
topologically deﬁned periods: ω1(ϕ) measures the circulation around the axis of
symmetry, and ω2(ϕ) measures the circulation through the hole.
We may therefore neatly identify the equivalence class of ϕ with a 2-dimensional vector,
which we shall call the period vector, ω(ϕ), given by
ω(ϕ) ≡
"
ω1(ϕ)
ω2(ϕ)
#
.
Finally, observe that if we add two ﬂows from two different equivalence classes, their period vectors
add, as follows:
ω(eϕ + ϕ) =
"
ω1(eϕ + ϕ)
ω2(eϕ + ϕ)
#
=
"
ω1(eϕ)
ω2(eϕ)
#
+
"
ω1(ϕ)
ω2(ϕ)
#
= ω(eϕ) + ω(ϕ).
We have thus found the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group of the torus:
H1(torus) = R2.

Differential Geometry via Forms
38.1
Introduction: Cartan’s Method of Moving Frames
At long last, we are ﬁnally ready to put the “Devil’s machine”1 to work in the service of geometry!
In this ﬁnal chapter of this ﬁnal Act, we shall apply the machinery of Cartan’s Forms to
Differential Geometry, just as Cartan himself did, reproving by computation many of the same
fundamental results that were proved geometrically in the ﬁrst four Acts. Furthermore, we shall
see that Forms naturally lead us to many new results. We begin by outlining our battle plans, and
their historical origins.
Recall that Frenet in 1847, and (independently) Serret in 1851, both analyzed curves in R3 by
attaching an orthonormal frame (T, N, B) to the curve, ﬁnding that its rate of change along the
curve is given by the Frenet–Serret Equations, (9.3), which we repeat here:



.
(38.1)
Thus, as this frame moves along the curve, its rate of rotation is fully encoded as the matrix [Ω],
which is skew-symmetric (i.e., [Ω]T = −[Ω]).
The success of this enterprise hinged upon two ideas:
IDEA 1: Adapt the frame to the curve in a geometrically meaningful way, called the Frenet Frame:
T is tangent to the curve, and N is the principal normal, lying within the instantaneous plane
of motion, and pointing at the instantaneous centre of curvature. B is then determined by the
right hand rule.
IDEA 2: Express the rate of change of the frame in terms of the frame itself.
Around 1880, Jean-Gaston Darboux took the next step, extending these ideas to surfaces:
IDEA 3: Adapt the frame to a surface, by choosing one of the vectors to be the normal to the surface;
the remaining two vectors are then automatically tangent vectors to the surface.
Starting around 1900, Élie Cartan developed Forms and brought them to bear on Differential
Geometry, his efforts reaching substantial completion in Cartan (1928), though the ﬁnal perfection
of his ideas was perhaps Cartan (1945):
IDEA 4: Free the frame completely, and allow it to vary in any (differentiable) way whatsoever
throughout R3. Instead of calling it the Frenet Frame, we now call it Cartan’s moving frame
ﬁeld, referring to this approach as a whole as Cartan’s method of moving frames. As we shall
see shortly, this again yields a skew-symmetric matrix, but it is now a matrix of 1-forms.
1See Prologue.

•

IDEA 5: Replace the moving frame with its dual frame of 1-forms, and look at its rate of change in
an arbitrary direction in space. Recapitulating IDEA 2, express this rate of change of the dual
basis in terms of the dual basis itself.
Let us pause in order to comment on IDEA 4, which would appear to be an ill-fated step
backwards. Frenet, Serret, and Darboux had all adapted their frames to a geometrical object in a
geometrically meaningful way, so it made sense that their examination of its rate of change would
yield geometrically meaningful information about that object.
But (diabolical) Cartan instead instructs us to do the following. Take your right hand, and
arrange your thumb (imagined Satanically elongated!), foreﬁnger, and middle ﬁnger into an
orthonormal frame. Now wave your hand about in space, twisting your hand as you go!2
Even if ﬂeetingly, you have created an arbitrary moving frame ﬁeld, at least at each point of the
region of space that your hand passed through. Now imagine an entire region of space ﬁlled (differ-
entiably) with such an arbitrary moving frame ﬁeld. How on earth can anything mathematically
interesting arise from looking at the arbitrary gyrations of your three ﬁngers?!
Very remarkably, Cartan found that such an arbitrary moving frame ﬁeld is subject to two
extremely elegant laws, called Cartan’s First and Second Structural Equations.3 These are the subject
of Section 38.4.
Most authors pass over the existence of these laws in silence, as if to say, “Keep moving!
Nothing to see here.” But when I ﬁrst saw these two equations as a student, I was shocked—
perceiving them to be magical, and possibly black-magical, at that! Even now, I cannot offer you a
truly compelling explanation for the existence of these beautiful laws, but consider this . . . .
To specify a unit vector in R3, or, equivalently, a point on the unit sphere, we need two
numbers—say, longitude and latitude. Thus three arbitrary unit vectors require six numbers. But
now consider Cartan’s orthonormal moving frame ﬁeld, and suppose we are told just one of his vec-
tors (using two numbers). We then know that the tips of the remaining two, orthogonal vectors of
the frame lie somewhere on the unit circle orthogonal to the given vector. Thus the remaining two
vectors can be pinned down with the speciﬁcation of a single angle (of either one).
In other words, the extra structure provided by the orthogonality of Cartan’s moving frame
ﬁeld has reduced the amount of data by half. To phrase this the other way around, Cartan’s
orthonormal moving frame ﬁeld has twice the structure of a nonorthogonal ﬁeld.
IDEA 6: Having risen above the fray to obtain his completely general Structural Equations for an
arbitrary moving frame ﬁeld, Cartan then descended to Earth, and adapted them to speciﬁc
geometrical objects.
When Cartan adapted them to a curve, he simply recovered (38.1). But when he adapted
his moving frame ﬁeld to a surface—Darboux’s IDEA 3—Cartan’s Structural Equations imme-
diately yielded all the Fundamental Equations of a Surface, but in a much more compact and
elegant form than had been obtained by Gauss, Darboux, Codazzi, and other early masters
of Differential Geometry—all thanks to their expression in Cartan’s language of Forms. These
Form equations are the subject of Section 38.5.
In this chapter we shall follow closely in the footsteps of the trail-blazing text of UCLA Profes-
sor Barrett O’Neill (1924–2011), Elementary Differential Geometry (second revised edition), the ﬁrst
edition of which appeared in 1966.
Today, more than a half-century later, O’Neill’s work remains, in our view, the single most
clear-eyed, elegant, and (ironically) modern treatment of the subject available—present company
2We humbly suggest that you do not attempt this in public!

excepted!—at the undergraduate level. Indeed, as of this writing, it still stands essentially4 alone in
its pioneering embrace of Forms as the principal means of communicating Differential Geometry
to an undergraduate audience.
We shall carry our investigations substantially further than O’Neill’s text, calculating the
Riemann tensor of an n-manifold using curvature 2-forms, and also providing many geometri-
cal explanations that he does not. Nevertheless, O’Neill investigates many very interesting topics
that we shall not. Therefore, we strongly recommend O’Neill’s pioneering work as a companion
or follow-up text to this ﬁnal chapter.

Connection 1-Forms
38.2.1
Notational Conventions and Two Deﬁnitions
Before we get going, let us remind you of some of our (ongoing) notational conventions:
•
Vectors are denoted by lowercase bold Roman letters, e.g., v.
•
1-forms are denoted by lowercase bold Greek letters, e.g., θ.
•
2-forms are denoted by uppercase bold Greek letters, e.g., Ψ.
•
Matrices are denoted by square brackets, e.g., [A] = [aij], where aij denotes the matrix entry
in row i, and column j.
To avoid any possibility of confusion while you become acclimatized to Cartan’s ideas, we
shall depart from usual practice and dispense with the Einstein summation convention, instead
writing out summation signs, or even writing out the sums explicitly. This is actually a very small
sacriﬁce because we shall see that once we specialize to 2-surfaces many of the “sums” reduce to
a single term!
Finally, here are two deﬁnitions, one old and one new:
•
As usual, let {ej} be the ﬁxed Euclidean orthonormal basis, with dual 1-form basis {dxi}. Thus,
as we saw in (32.12), dxi(ej) = δi
j.
•
Let {mj} be Cartan’s (arbitrary, but differentiable) orthonormal moving frame ﬁeld, and let its
dual 1-form basis be {θi}. Then, by deﬁnition, θi(mj) = δi
j.
Note that while [32.6] showed that a general, nonorthogonal basis does not allow us to
pair an individual basis vector with a matching 1-form, this is no longer true of our orthonormal
moving frame ﬁeld: we can think of θi as the dual of mi.
38.2.2
Connection 1-Forms
Let us apply IDEA 2 to Cartan’s moving frame ﬁeld. That is, let us express the rate of change of the
moving frame ﬁeld in terms of the frame ﬁeld itself.
In the case of the Frenet–Serret Equations, the Frenet frame was only deﬁned along the curve,
and we only needed to look at its rate of change along that curve, but now we must examine how
our moving frame ﬁeld rotates as we move off in some general direction v in space:
∇vm1
=
c11 m1 + c12 m2 + c13 m3
∇vm2
=
c21 m1 + c22 m2 + c23 m3
∇vm3
=
c31 m1 + c32 m2 + c33 m3.
4Darling (1994) is the closest thing to an exception that we know of, but it smacks more of a graduate text.

38.2 Connection 1-Forms

If we collect these coefﬁcients into the matrix [C] ≡[cij], and make the abbreviation,
[m] ≡


m1
m2
m3

,
then we can rewrite these equations more neatly and compactly as
∇v[m] = [C][m].
Since the moving frame ﬁeld is (by deﬁnition) orthonormal, it follows that these coefﬁcients—
making up the entries of the matrix [C]—are given by
cij =
(
∇vmi
)·mj.
But these coefﬁcients depend on the choice of v, so we change our notation5 and write them as
functions of v:
ωij(v) ≡
(
∇vmi
)·mj is the initial rate at which mi tips towards mj as the
frame moves along v.
(38.2)
Perhaps you will not be surprised to learn that these ωij are 1-forms!
The ωij are called the connection 1-forms, and ωji = −ωij.
WARNING: the two subscripts attached to ωij immediately (but wrongly!) make one think of the
components of tensor of valence
{
0
2
}
. Let us therefore stress that these are all 1-forms, housed
within a matrix of 1-forms, and the subscripts serve to identify the row and column of each 1-form
entry within this matrix.
We begin by verifying that they are indeed 1-forms:
ωij(a v + b w)
=
(
∇av+bw mi
)·mj
=
(
a ∇vmi + b ∇wmi
)·mj
=
a
(
∇vmi
)·mj + b
(
∇wmi
)·mj
=
a ωij(v) + b ωij(w).
Next, to prove ωji = −ωij, we must show that ωji(v) = −ωij(v) for every vector v:
0 = ∇vδi
j = ∇v
(
mi·mj
)
= ∇v
(
mi
)·mj +
(
∇vmj
)·mi = ωij(v) + ωji(v).
A geometrical explanation of this result is implicit in the upcoming diagram, [38.2].
5Frustratingly, the order of the indices varies by author. We shall employ the notation of O’Neill (2006), whereas Dray (2015),
for example, has i and j reversed: his ωji is our ωij.

434
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
It follows that
ω11 = ω22 = ω33 = 0.
Therefore, the matrix [C] of coefﬁcients is a skew-symmetric matrix of 1-forms, with only three
independent entries, ω12, ω13, ω23:
[ω] ≡


ω11

ω21


.
If we take it as understood that [ω](v) = [ω(v)] means that each 1-form entry within the matrix
acts on v, then the rotation of the moving frame ﬁeld as it moves off in a general direction v can
be elegantly described by the so-called Connection Equations:
∇v[m] = [ω(v)][m].
(38.3)
In component form, this states
∇vmi = ∑
j ωij(v) mj.
(38.4)
For fear that elegance become the enemy of clarity, let us simply spell out these equations in
full:
∇vm1
=
ω12(v) m2 + ω13(v) m3
∇vm2
=
−ω12(v) m1
+ ω23(v) m3
∇vm3
=
−ω13(v) m1 −ω23(v) m2.
We can use IDEA 6 to recover the Frenet–Serret equations from these general equations, as
follows: we simply adapt the moving frame to the curve, by choosing
m1 = T,
m2 = N,
m3 = B,
and
v = T.
In comparing these equations with (38.1), the only mystery is the absence of a term corresponding
to ω13(v).
To understand this, recall that B is the normal to the instantaneous plane of motion of the
curve (osculating plane); the orthogonal pair (T, N) rotate together within this plane, about the axis
B. This means that T = m1 does not tip in the direction of B = m3, so (38.2) implies ω13(v) = 0,
thereby explaining the mystery.
38.2.3
WARNING: Notational Hazing Rituals Ahead!
First the good news: the connection 1-forms are (almost) universally written ωij, just as we have
written them, though often an index is raised (ωi
j) in order to be able to employ the Einstein
summation convention—we too shall adopt this notation in due course.
Our use of θi to denote the dual basis of 1-forms follows O’Neill (2006). Happily, this notation
is widespread, but other perfectly reasonable alternatives exist e.g., Dray (2015) writes θi as σi.

38.3 The Attitude Matrix
•
435
Now the bad news: several highly respected mathematicians6—including more than one
Fields Medalist—have elected to employ a notation that seems to us to have been expressly and
perversely designed to induce maximum befuddlement of the hapless student—instead of θi, these
mathematicians write ωi! Yes, they use the same Greek letter to denote the connection 1-forms ωi
j
and the basis 1-forms ωi, with only the number of indices as clue that the symbols represent
entirely different concepts!
Although rarer, there exists an equally perverse alternative notation—of which Chern et al.
(1999) provide an exemplar—in which the dual basis is written θi, just as we have written it, but
in which the same Greek letter is used to denote the connection 1-forms, written θi
j!
It is very hard to see these extraordinary notational follies as anything other than hazing rit-
uals, designed to test the determination of impudent neophytes who would dare to master the
learned treatises of their elders and betters!
We feel compelled to quote one of our scientiﬁc heroes, Cornelius Lanczos (1893–1974). In the
preface to his (wonderful) Variational Principles of Mechanics, Lanczos (1970) writes,
Many of the scientiﬁc treatises of today are formulated in a half-mystical language, as
though to impress the reader with the uncomfortable feeling that he is in the permanent
presence of a superman. The present book is conceived in a humble spirit and is written
for humble people.
Well, tiptoeing in the giant footsteps of Lanczos, we too shall speak to you humbly, as plainly
and as clearly as possible, welcoming you into the glorious garden of Cartan’s discoveries. And, for
that reason, we shall denote different concepts with different letters.
38.3
The Attitude Matrix
38.3.1
The Connection Forms via the Attitude Matrix
The attitude in space of the USS Enterprise7 (or, less interestingly, any rigid body) means its
orientation within R3.
To describe the attitude of Cartan’s moving frame ﬁeld {mj}, we need only specify the rotation
A of the ﬁxed Euclidean frame {ej} that brings it into coincidence with {mj}.
This rotation is described by the attitude matrix [A] = [aij], in which the entries are functions
of position, since the whole idea is that the attitude of the m-frame varies in space. Thus, if we
write
[e] ≡


e1
e2
e3

,
then
[m] = [A] [e].
It follows from our geometrical interpretation of the transpose of a matrix (given in Ex. 12,
p. 221) that the matrix of a rotation must satisfy
6Sadly, my beloved Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) must also be counted amongst these sinners! Saddest of all, the origin
of this notation was none other than Cartan (1927) himself! Cartan’s works have always “enjoyed” the reputation of being very
hard to understand; I would argue that his choice of notation did not help matters!

Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
[A]T = [A]−1.
(38.5)
Recall from Linear Algebra that such a matrix is called orthogonal.
It is intuitively clear that the rate of change of [A] determines the rate of change of the m-
frame, and thus it must determine the connection 1-forms. To derive an explicit formula, let us
ﬁrst agree that the exterior derivative of a matrix is the matrix of the exterior derivatives of its
entries:
d[A] = d[aij] = [daij].
We will now show that the matrix of connection 1-forms is given by
[ω] =
(
d[A]
)
[A]T .
(38.6)
Since [aij]T = [aji], the matrix equation (38.6) is equivalent to this component equation:
ωij = ∑
k
(
daik
)
ajk.
(38.7)
To prove this, we ﬁrst compute the rate of rotation of the moving frame itself:
∇vmi = ∇v
∑
k
aik ek =
∑
k
(daik)(v) ek,
because ∇vek = 0.
According to the deﬁnition (38.2) of the connection 1-forms, we must now determine how
much of this tipping of mi is in the direction of mj. Since
mj =
∑
l
ajl el,
we ﬁnd that
mj·ek =
∑
l
ajl el·ek = ajk,
and therefore,
ωij(v) ≡
(
∇vmi
)·mj =
∑
k
(daik)(v) ek·mj =
∑
k
(
daik(v)
)
ajk.
Abstracting away the arbitrary vector v, we have therefore proved (38.7), and, with it, the matrix
equation (38.6).

Example: The Cylindrical Frame Field
The left panel of [38.1] shows the deﬁnition of the cylindrical frame ﬁeld, derived from the illus-
trated cylindrical polar coordinate system,8 (r, ϑ, z). From this ﬁgure, one easily deduces [exercise]
that
m1

cos ϑ e1 + sin ϑ e2

−sin ϑ e1 + cos ϑ e2

nates, (r, ϑ, z). Looking down the z-axis from above, the middle panel shows the m1 ﬁeld, and the right panel
shows the m2 ﬁeld.
It is desirable to get a feel for the cylindrical frame ﬁeld throughout space, rather than at the
single illustrated point. To that end, the middle panel of [38.1] shows a top view (looking down
the z-axis) of the entire m1 vector ﬁeld, which radiates outward (horizontally), away from the the
z-axis. Likewise, the panel on the right shows the top view of the m2 vector ﬁeld, which swirls
around the z-axis. We have not drawn it, but the m3 vector ﬁeld is simply a uniform upward ﬂow,
of unit speed, parallel to the z-axis.
From the formulas above, we easily read off the attitude matrix:
[A] =


cos ϑ
sin ϑ

−sin ϑ

−dϑ(v) m1 = −(∇vϑ) m1

We presented this example as very useful practice with the mechanics of the attitude matrix,
the connection 1-forms, and the connection equations. However, we can in fact obtain these ﬁnal
three equations directly and geometrically, without any computation.
8Here we have switched from the traditional θ to ϑ, in order to avoid any possible confusion with the dual-basis 1-forms, θj.

Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
[38.2] Moving along a short (ultimately vanishing) vector v in space results in a small (ultimately vanishing)
rotation δϑ of the orthogonal pair (m1, m2). The tip of m1 moves through distance δϑ along the illustrated
arc of the unit circle. Since the tip initially moves in the direction orthogonal to itself, δm1 ≍δϑ m2. Likewise,
δm2 ≍−δϑ m1.
The last equation is trivial: m3 = e3 is constant, so of course its derivative vanishes. The ﬁrst
two equations are much more interesting, and we now derive them geometrically.
First, we observe that if v is very short, and ultimately vanishing, then
dϑ(v) ≍δϑ ≡change in ϑ from tail to tip of v.
Next, by the same token,
∇vmj
≍
δmj
≡
change in mj from tail to tip of v
=
change in mj brought about by the change δϑ,
resulting from the movement along v.
Now consider [38.2], which shows the orthogonal pair (m1, m2) rotating rigidly together
through δϑ. Focus on the change δm1. The tip of m1 moves through distance δϑ along the illus-
trated arc of the unit circle. Initially, the tip moves in the direction orthogonal to itself, in other
words, in the direction of m2, as illustrated. Therefore, we have proved the ﬁrst of the two
connection equations, in the form
δm1 ≍δϑ m2.
The same diagram simultaneously proves the second connection equation:
δm2 ≍−δϑ m1.

Cartan’s Two Structural Equations
38.4.1
The Duals θi of mi in Terms of the Duals dxj of ej
Recall that (Cartan’s) IDEA 5 is to replace the moving frame ﬁeld mi with its dual 1-form
basis θi.
We know that (by deﬁnition) the attitude matrix [aij] transforms the ﬁxed Euclidean basis
{ej} into Cartan’s moving frame ﬁeld, according to

38.4 Cartan’s Two Structural Equations
•
439
mi =
∑
k
aik ek.
We now show that the same rotation matrix transforms the 1-form basis {dxj} dual to {ej} into
the 1-form basis {θi} dual to {mi}:
[θ] = [A] [dx].
(38.8)
Expressed in terms of components,
θi = ∑
k aij dxj.
(38.9)
To prove this, ﬁrst recall from (32.14), page 357, that any 1-form φ can be decomposed into
components in the {dxj} basis by applying φ to the Euclidean basis vectors. Thus, in particular,
θi =
∑
j
θi(ej) dxj.
But because θi is dual to mi,
θi(ej) = mi·ej =
[∑
k
aik ek
]
·ej = aij,
completing the proof of (38.9).
38.4.2
Cartan’s First Structural Equation
The connection equations (38.3) tell us the rotation of the moving frame ﬁeld mi as we move in an
arbitrary direction v. It is therefore natural to ask how the dual 1-forms θi vary in space. Since the
exterior derivative measures the rate of change in all directions (simultaneously!), it is d[θ] that we
seek.
The remarkably elegant answer is Cartan’s First Structural Equation:
d[θ] = [ω] ∧[θ],
(38.10)
where
[θ] ≡


θ1
θ2
θ3

.
The proof is a simple computation. Writing
[dx] ≡


dx1


,
(38.9) becomes
[θ] = [A][dx].

Differentiating, and using ﬁrst (38.5) and then (38.6),
d[θ] = d[A] ∧[dx] = d[A][A]T ∧[A][dx] = [ω] ∧[θ].

When performing concrete calculations, it is sometimes useful to rephrase (38.10) in terms of
its components:
dθi = ∑
j ωij ∧θj
(38.11)
38.4.3
Cartan’s Second Structural Equation
Now let us ask how the connection 1-forms vary in space. Again, the exterior derivative
simultaneously encodes the variation in all possible directions, so it is d[ω] that we seek.
The remarkably elegant answer is Cartan’s Second Structural Equation:
d[ω] = [ω] ∧[ω].
(38.12)
As we shall see in Section 38.12, the deeper geometric meaning of this equation is that char-
acterized the lack of curvature, the ﬂatness of the Euclidean space R3 within which we have been
operating up till now. When we move on to curved manifolds, such as Einstein’s gravitationally
warped spacetime, the two sides of this equation are no longer equal, and in fact the difference
between the two sides will be found to encode the curvature of the manifold.
To prove the equation, we require three simple lemmas. First, note that if f and g are functions,
then
d(df g) = d(g df) = dg ∧df = −df ∧dg.
Next, recall that the geometrical interpretation of the transpose (given in Ex. 12, p. 221) implies
that (AB)T = BT AT . Finally, recall that [ω] is skew-symmetric: [ω]T = −[ω].
Therefore, differentiating (38.6),

Example: The Spherical Frame Field
In this section we shall ﬁnd the dual basis and the connection Forms associated with the spher-
ical polar coordinates9 (r, ϕ, ϑ) of Section 35.4, and we shall use them to test/illustrate Cartan’s
Structural Equations.
In the following, we shall write cϑ ≡cos ϑ, sϕ ≡sin ϕ, etc., in part to save space, but also
because we ﬁnd this to be a clarifying notation in private, pencil-and-paper calculations.
From [38.3], we see that,

At this point we can calculate the connection Forms using (38.6):
[ω] =
(
d[A]
)
[A]T .
Clearly, this will require lengthy and arduous computations, which we hereby assign as a
(cruel)10 exercise! However, let us at least offer some concrete guidance on how to carry out such
computations.
First, we certainly don’t need to multiply the entire matrix d[A] by the entire matrix [A]. For
example, calculating a diagonal entry is a waste of time: we know it must be zero! In fact we only
need to calculate the three entries in the top-right corner of the product: ω12, ω13, ω23.
In order to target just these three entries, it is simpler to use the component form of the matrix
product, namely, (38.7):
ωij =
∑
k
(
daik
)
ajk.
Thus we never need to actually form the transpose of [A]. Instead, we interpret this formula
as telling us that
To obtain ωij we take d of the i-th row of [A], then multiply each element by the
corresponding one in the j-th row of [A].
9O’Neill (2006, pp. 86, 97) instead measures ϕ from the equator, so our ϕ is obtained by subtracting his from (π/2). This has
the effect of interchanging sin ϕ and cos ϕ. Also, in order to make the frame right-handed, the order of O’Neill’s coordinates
is (r, ϑ, ϕ), and his spherical frame ﬁeld, written (F1, F2, F3), is therefore related to ours by (m1 = F1, m2 = −F3, m3 = F2).
10When forced to assign such a cruel computation to my USF students, I simultaneously assign them a viewing of Tarentino’s
Kill Bill, Vol. 2, Chapter 8: The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei, for it demonstrates how such “cruelty” ultimately saved Beatrix Kiddo
from the grave!

For example, to ﬁnd ω12, we must take d of the ﬁrst row, and multiply it by the second row:
ω12 =
[
d(sϕ cϑ)
]
cϕ cϑ +
[
d(sϕ sϑ)
]
cϕ sϑ −
[

sϕ.
Even if you don’t feel up to calculating all three connection Forms, we urge you to at least do this
one. After taking the derivatives, you will be faced with ﬁve terms, each of which is the product
of four trigonometric functions. But then, “miraculously,” everything cancels or simpliﬁes, and we
are left with a beautifully simple answer: ω12 = dϕ!
Equally “miraculous” cancellations and simpliﬁcations occur in the calculation of the other
two connection Forms, and we obtain the following simple formulas:
ω12 = dϕ
ω13 = sin ϕ dϑ
ω23 = cos ϕ dϑ.
(38.14)
[38.3] Geometric proof that θ1 = dr, θ2 = r dϕ, and
θ3 = r sin ϕ dϑ.
Recalling what was said in the Pro-
logue, we have here three examples of
what we call “false miracles”: if all those
terms cancelled, they should never have
been there in the ﬁrst place—we must be
looking at the mathematics in the wrong
way!
By this point in our drama it can
surely come as no surprise to learn that
the correct way to look at this is geo-
metrically. All of the painful calculations
you just performed are thereby avoided,
and the results are obtained directly and
intuitively! We shall provide this Newto-
nian, geometrical explanation at the end
of this section, but for now we press on
in our quest to test Cartan’s Structural
Equations.
To that end, let us ﬁnd the dual-
basis 1-forms, θi. Again, we can cer-
tainly obtain these by blind computa-
tion: we know [A] and we know [x], so
we can calculate d[x] = [dx], and hence
we can use (38.8):
[θ] = [A] [dx].
But, again, this will clearly require a lengthy computation, which we hereby assign as another
cruel exercise! (You will appreciate what comes next so much more if you actually carry out these
calculations, which are ﬁlled with many cancellations and simpliﬁcations. Having successfully
hacked your way through this dense thicket of symbols, you should emerge into a clearing, within
which you will ﬁnd these simple formulas: (38.16).)
Here, too, Newtonian geometry allows us leap through the air, ﬂying over the lengthy and
opaque calculations beneath us, landing directly at the answers!
Consider the shaded box in [38.3] in the limit that it shrinks and ultimately vanishes. Its edges
are ultimately equal to

as illustrated. Therefore, the diagonal of the box, which points in an arbitrary direction, is the short
(ultimately vanishing) vector v, given by
v ≍δr m1 + r δϕ m2 + r sϕ δϑ m3.
(38.15)
By deﬁnition of the dual basis, θi(mj) = δi
j, so,
θ1(v) ≍δr ≍dr(v)
=⇒
θ1 = dr.
This follows from the fact that v is arbitrary, and therefore can be abstracted away.
We ﬁnd θ2 and θ3 in exactly the same way. Therefore, the geometry of [38.3] immediately

thereby verifying Cartan’s Second Structural Equation for the spherical frame ﬁeld.
As promised, we end this section by returning to the connection Forms, showing that the
lengthy calculations that led to (38.14) can be replaced with simple, clear, Newtonian geometry.
To do so, we shall apply Newtonian ultimate equalities directly to the deﬁnition (38.2):
ωij(v) ≡
(
∇vmi
)·mj is the initial rate at which mi tips towards mj as the
frame moves along v.
Here we shall take v to be the arbitrary, short (ultimately vanishing) vector given by (38.15):
v ≍δr m1 + r δϕ m2 + r sϕ δϑ m3.
The key tool in the following analysis is the fact that, since v is short, and ultimately vanishing,
∇vmi ≍change in mi from tail to tip of v ≡δmi.
Note that in order to easily visualize the changes δmi, we shall draw all the vectors mi as
emanating from a common point; then δmi is simply the movement of the tip of mi.
We begin with ω12(v) ≡
(
∇vm1
)·m2. Consider the changes δm1 in m1 that result from
moving along each of the three components of v, separately:
• Moving radially outward along δr m1 keeps m1 constant: it does not tip towards m2 (or
anything else!).
• Moving along r sϕ δϑ m3 (due East, along the circle of latitude) causes m1 to rotate around
the cone shown in the top half of [38.5], of semivertical angle ϕ and slant height 1, and therefore
base radius sϕ. Evidently, δm1 is orthogonal to m2, so this too makes zero contribution to ω12.
In greater detail, we note for future use that the ﬁgure demonstrates that
δm1 = sϕ δϑ m3.
(38.17)
• As an aside, for future use, we note that this rotation causes m2 to rotate around the cone
shown in the bottom half of [38.5], of semivertical angle
( π
2 −ϕ
)
and slant height 1, and therefore
base radius cϕ. Thus, as illustrated,
δm2 = cϕ δϑ m3.
(38.18)
• Returning our focus to m1, the only part of v that does cause m1 to tip towards m2 is the
southward movement r δϕ m2 towards the equator, along the meridian. Figure [38.4] is drawn in
the vertical plane of this meridian, containing m1 and m2. As m1 rotates through angle δϕ, its tip
ultimately moves along δm1 ≍δϕ m2, as illustrated. Therefore,
ω12(v) ≍δm1·m2 ≍
(
δϕ m2
)·m2 = δϕ ≍dϕ(v)
=⇒
ω12 = dϕ.

Next, consider
ω13(v) ≡
(
∇vm1
)·m3.
Here we are considering the same changes
δm1 in m1 as above, but now we want to
know how much δm1 points in the direction
of m3 (instead of m2).
As we have seen, the only part of v that
produces a δm1 along m3 is the movement
along r sϕ δϑ m3. From (38.17) we immedi-
ately deduce that
ω13(v) ≍δm1·m3 ≍
(
sϕ δϑ m3
)·m3
= sϕ δϑ ≍sϕ dϑ(v)
=⇒
ω13 = sϕ dϑ.
Finally, consider ω23(v) ≡
(
∇vm2
)·m3. It is easy to see [exercise] that the only component
of v that causes m2 to tip in the direction of m3 is the movement along r sϕ δϑ m3 (due East,
along the circle of latitude). Thus, using (38.18), illustrated in the bottom cone of [38.5], we deduce
that
ω23(v) ≍δm2·m3 ≍
(
cϕ δϑ m3
)·m3 = cϕ δϑ ≍cϕ dϑ(v)
=⇒
ω23 = cϕ dϑ.
This completes our geometrical proof of (38.14). Again, contrast the illuminating simplic-
ity and directness of this Newtonian geometrical reasoning with the three long, unilluminating
calculations you were originally forced to perform in order to arrive at these three formulas!

The Six Fundamental Form Equations of a Surface
38.5.1
Adapting Cartan’s Moving Frame to a Surface:
The Shape Operator and the Extrinsic Curvature
We now implement Darboux’s IDEA 3 (adapt the frame to a surface) in combination with Cartan’s
IDEA 6: use Forms, specializing Cartan’s two Structural Equations to this adapted frame ﬁeld.
Given a surface S with normal n, we choose m3 = n; this is called the adapted frame ﬁeld. Then
(m1, m2) becomes an intrinsic (i.e., tangent) basis for the vectors v “within” S.
Henceforth, we shall only consider such vectors v that are tangent to S. When applied to such a
tangent vector, the connection equations (38.4) yield the following simple expression for the Shape
Operator S ((15.4), p. 151) in terms of the connection Forms:
S(v) = ω13(v) m1 + ω23(v) m2.
(38.19)
The proof goes as follows:
S(v) = −∇vn = −∇vm3 = −
[
∇vm3·m1
]
m1 −
[
∇vm3·m2
]
m2.
The last step is to insert the deﬁnitions of the connection 1-forms, (38.2), taking note of their skew-
symmetry.
The ﬁrst column of the matrix [S] representing the Shape Operator is the image under S of
the ﬁrst basis vector, namely, S(m1). Likewise, the second column is the image of the second basis
vector. Therefore,
[S] =
[
ω13(m1)
ω13(m2)
ω23(m1)
ω23(m2)
]
.
(38.20)
Let us now use this to express the extrinsic curvature Kext = κ1κ2 in terms of the connection
Forms. Since we intend to reprove fundamental results from the ﬁrst four Acts, we must avoid-
ing making assumptions based on this prior knowledge. Thus we must revert to distinguishing
between extrinsic and intrinsic measurements of curvature. Only then can we prove (and appreci-
ate!) Gauss’s Theorema Egregium, which reveals that these two measures of curvature are actually
the same!
On the other hand, it is certainly not our intention to use Forms to rebuild the entire ediﬁce
of Differential Geometry from scratch! So long as we are explicit about which former results are
being invoked, and circular reasoning is scrupulously avoided, no harm can arise from this hybrid
approach.
Thus, now, recall from (15.8), page 153, that the extrinsic curvature Kext of S measures the
spreading of the normal vectors m3 over a small patch of surface. More precisely, it is the local area
expansion factor of S. In other words, it is the determinant of the matrix [S] representing S:
Kext = det[S] = ω13(m1) ω23(m2) −ω13(m2) ω23(m1).
We have arrived at an expression for the extrinsic curvature that will soon prove its importance:
Kext =
(
ω13 ∧ω23
)
(m1, m2).
(38.21)

38.5 The Six Fundamental Form Equations of a Surface
•
447
Finally, consider the 1-form basis θi dual to the adapted frame ﬁeld (m1, m2, m3). These give
the coordinates θi(v) = v·mi of any tangent vector v with respect to the adapted frame ﬁeld.
As with the connection Forms, these dual-basis Forms will be applied only to tangent vectors to
S, so that they become Forms on S. O’Neill (2006, p. 266) states the implication perfectly: “this
restriction is fatal to θ3, for if v is tangent to S, it is orthogonal to m3, so θ3(v) = v·m3 = 0. Thus θ3
is identically zero on S.”
38.5.2
Example: The Sphere
[38.6] The adapted frame ﬁeld has (by deﬁnition) m3 = n.
The resulting changes of names imply that, now, θ1 = R dϕ,
and θ2 = ρ dϑ = R sin ϕ dϑ.
In order to adapt the spherical frame
ﬁeld to a particular sphere, r = R, we
must relabel the vectors shown in [38.3].
The radial vector (which was m1) is
the normal to the sphere, and there-
fore (according to our convention) it
must be relabelled as m3. The remain-
ing two members of the original frame
ﬁeld, tangent to the sphere, must like-
wise be relabelled, as shown in [38.6],
subject to the right-hand rule: m1 points
South, and m2 points East.
It follows that the previously obtained
1-form basis θi and the connection
Forms ωij are now given by,11
θ1 = R dϕ
ω12 = cϕ dϑ
θ2 = R sϕ dϑ
ω13 = −dϕ
ω23 = −sϕ dϑ
As valuable practice with the geometrical methods we have just explained, try checking each
of these ﬁve results, simply by inspecting [38.6]—no calculations required!
Finally, note that the shaded element of area is A = (R δϕ)(ρ δϑ) = R2 sin ϑ δϕ δϑ. Thus, the
area 2-form of the sphere—or, indeed, of any surface—is
A = θ1 ∧θ2.
(38.22)
38.5.3
Uniqueness of Basis Decompositions
Let us brieﬂy review the uniqueness of the decomposition of 1-forms and 2-forms relative to a
basis; both these facts will be needed in short order.
For 1-forms within S, our basis is (θ1, θ2). Recall that two 1-forms φ and ψ are equal if and only if
φ(m1) = ψ(m1)
and
φ(m2) = ψ(m2).
It follows immediately [exercise] that φ can be uniquely decomposed as
φ = φ(m1) θ1 + φ(m2) θ2.
(38.23)
11Again, these do not match the results you will ﬁnd in O’Neill (2006, p. 267), because his different method of deﬁning ϕ
changes everything.

448
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
Likewise, two 2-forms Φ and Ψ are equal if and only if
Φ(m1, m2) = Ψ(m1, m2).
It follows immediately [exercise] that Φ can be uniquely decomposed as
Φ = Φ(m1, m2) A = Φ(m1, m2) θ1 ∧θ2.
(38.24)
In particular, applying this result to (38.21), we ﬁnd that
ω13 ∧ω23 =
(
ω13 ∧ω23
)
(m1, m2) θ1 ∧θ2 = Kext θ1 ∧θ2.
(38.25)
38.5.4
The Six Fundamental Form Equations of a Surface
Let us immediately state all six of these equations, and also state their names,12 in one fell swoop.
We will then prove them by calculation, and ﬁnally, gradually, extract their true geometrical
meanings.
dθ1 = ω12 ∧θ2
dθ2 = ω21 ∧θ1
First Structural Equations
ω31 ∧θ1 + ω32 ∧θ2 = 0
Symmetry Equation
dω12 = ω13 ∧ω32
Gauss Equation
dω13 = ω12 ∧ω23
dω23 = ω21 ∧ω13
Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations
(38.26)
In our description of the surface S, only m3 is uniquely, geometrically determined by the
surface itself, as its normal. Meanwhile, we may arbitrarily twirl (m1, m2) within the surface,
about the axis m3. All these arbitrarily different frame ﬁelds yield different descriptions of the
surface—different dual-basis 1-forms, and different connection 1-forms. Nevertheless, despite these
freedoms, the six equations above embody everything that can be known or said about the surface.
It is therefore remarkable how quickly and easily all six equations follow from Cartan’s
Structural Equations—all we need do is set θ3 = 0.
Because ω11 = 0, the First Structural Equation, (38.11), immediately yields
dθ1 =
∑
j
ω1j ∧θj = ω12 ∧θ2 + ω13 ∧θ3 = ω12 ∧θ2.
The calculation of dθ2 is essentially identical.
12Here we largely adopt the names employed by O’Neill (2006, p. 267), but the reader should be aware that, while
widely used, these names are not universal. In particular, what O’Neill calls the Codazzi Equations are also commonly
known as the Mainardi–Codazzi Equations, but we have attempted to give credit where credit is due, calling them instead
the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations. For although Mainardi discovered the equations in 1856, and, independently,
Codazzi rediscovered them in 1860, both were anticipated in 1853 by a young Latvian student, Karl M. Peterson. Peterson’s
work (and priority) remained unknown until his dissertation (supervised by Minding!) was ﬁnally translated into Russian,
and published in 1952. See Phillips (1979).

38.6 Geometrical Meanings of the Symmetry Equation and the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations
•
449
The Symmetry Equation follows in the same way:
0 = dθ3 =
∑
j
ω3j ∧θj = ω31 ∧θ1 + ω32 ∧θ2.
Next, since ω11 = 0 = ω22, the Gauss Equation follows immediately from the Second Struc-
tural Equation, (38.13):
dω12 =
∑
k
ω1k ∧ωk2 = ω13 ∧ω32.
The ﬁnal two Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations follow from the Second Structural
Equation in exactly the same way.
38.6
Geometrical Meanings of the Symmetry Equation
and the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations
But what do these fundamental form equations actually mean?
Let us begin with the Symmetry Equation. If we apply this vanishing 2-form to the basis
vectors, we obtain
0
=
[
ω31 ∧θ1 + ω32 ∧θ2]
(m1, m2)
=
ω31(m1)θ1(m2) −ω31(m2)θ1(m1) + ω32(m1)θ2(m2) −ω32(m2)θ2(m1)
=
ω32(m1) −ω31(m2).
Thus, invoking the skew-symmetry of the connection Forms,
ω23(m1) = ω13(m2).
Therefore, referring back to (38.20), we deduce that
The Symmetry Equation is equivalent to the fact the Shape Operator is symmetric:
ST = S.
The geometrical interpretation of this symmetry was previously derived in (15.13), on page
156: The eigenvectors of S are orthogonal.
If we allow ourselves the former knowledge that these eigenvectors are in fact the principal
directions of maximum and minimum normal curvature, these curvatures being the associated
eigenvalues, κ1 and κ2, then we have reproved a major part of Euler’s discovery: these maximum
and minimum curvatures occur in orthogonal directions.
Let us break new ground, and reﬁne our adapted frame ﬁeld so as to make (m1, m2) align
with these principal directions at each point of S; this is called the principal frame ﬁeld. In this
case, S(m1) = κ1m1 and S(m2) = κ2m2, so we deduce that (38.20) takes the form
[S] =
[
ω13(m1)
ω13(m2)
ω23(m1)
ω23(m2)
]
=
[
κ1
0
0
κ2
]
.
Thus, by virtue of (38.23),
ω13 = κ1 θ1
and
ω23 = κ2 θ2.
(38.27)

450
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
We can now derive a geometrical interpretation of the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equa-
tions—this is genuinely new mathematics that we have not seen in the previous Acts. Inserting
the equations (38.27) into the ﬁrst Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equation of (38.26), we ﬁnd that
d
(
κ1 θ1)
= ω12 ∧κ2 θ2.
Thus,
dκ1 ∧θ1 + κ1 dθ1 = κ2 ω12 ∧θ2.
Using the First Structural Equation from (38.26), namely, dθ1 = ω12 ∧θ2, we deduce that
dκ1 ∧θ1 + κ1 ω12 ∧θ2 = κ2 ω12 ∧θ2,
and therefore,
dκ1 ∧θ1 = (κ2 −κ1) ω12 ∧θ2.
Finally, applying these 2-forms (these are the left and right sides of this equation) to the basis
vectors (m1, m2), we obtain
0 −dκ1(m2) = (κ2 −κ1) ω12(m1) −0.
Hence, the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equation now takes the geometrically meaningful form,
∇m2κ1 = (κ1 −κ2) ω12(m1).
(38.28)
Repeating this calculation for the other Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equation, we obtain
∇m1κ2 = (κ1 −κ2) ω12(m2).
(38.29)
In both these equations, ω12(v) tells us how fast the principal directions are rotating within
S as we move along the surface in the direction v. So, putting both equations into words, as we
move off at right angles to a principal direction, the rate of change of that principal curvature is
proportional to both the difference of the two principal curvatures, and to the rate at which the
principal directions rotate.
38.7
Geometrical Form of the Gauss Equation
Of the six Form equations (38.26), the Gauss Equation is undoubtedly the most important, for it
holds the key both to the intrinsic curvature, and to its relation to the extrinsic curvature. The
connection to the latter is immediate from (38.25), for this allows us rewrite the Gauss Equation in
a new, geometrically meaningful form.
Gauss Equation:
dω12 = −Kext θ1 ∧θ2.
(38.30)
For example, consider the sphere of radius R, analyzed in Section 38.5.2:
dω12 = d(cϕ dϑ) = −sϕ dϕ ∧dϑ = −1
R2 [R dϕ] ∧[R sϕ dϑ] = −1
R2 θ1 ∧θ2.
From this we immediately deduce (correctly!) that Kext = +(1/R2).

Proof of the Metric Curvature Formula
and the Theorema Egregium
38.8.1
Lemma: Uniqueness of ω12
The connection form ω12 = −ω21 is the only 1-form that satisﬁes Cartan’s First
Structural Equations of (38.26):
dθ1 = ω12 ∧θ2
and
dθ2 = −ω12 ∧θ1.
(38.31)
To prove this, we apply these 2-forms to the pair of basis vectors, (m1, m2), and ﬁnd that
[exercise]
ω12(m1) = dθ1(m1, m2)
and
ω12(m2) = dθ2(m1, m2).
It follows from (38.23) that ω12 is uniquely and explicitly given by
ω12 =
[
dθ1(m1, m2)
]
θ1 +
[
dθ2(m1, m2)
]
θ2,
(38.32)
thereby completing the proof of (38.31).
38.8.2
Proof of the Metric Curvature Formula
Mathematically speaking, we are now living in the twenty-third century—the future from which
the “Star Trek phaser” formula (4.10) was delivered to us, back through time, long ago on page 38.
Cartan’s Forms now make possible a computational proof of this Metric Curvature Formula
that is startling in its brevity and simplicity, on a par with our geometrical demonstration in [27.4].
From
ds2 = (A du)2 + (B dv)2,
we immediately deduce that the adapted 1-form basis for the surface is
θ1 = A du
and
θ2 = B dv,
(38.33)
and that the area 2-form of the surface is
A = θ1 ∧θ2 = AB du ∧dv.
We now calculate the exterior derivatives of the dual-basis 1-forms:

Comparing these equations with Cartan’s First Structural Equations, (38.31), we see immedi-
ately that one possible solution for ω12 is
ω12 = −BvA
B
du + BuB

(38.34)
But lemma (38.31) tells us that if this is a solution, then it is the only solution—it is the solution!

Comparing this with the Gauss Equation, (38.30), we see that, in a mere fraction of a page,
our work is done! We have (re)proved the very remarkable formula, (4.10):
Kext = −1
AB
(
Bv
[BvA

+ Bu
[BuB

.
(38.35)
The extrinsic curvature Kext = κ1κ2 on the left-hand side of this equation arose from (38.21)—
it measures the spreading of the normal vectors to the surface in space. But the expression on
the right-hand side of this equation depends only on the intrinsic metric geometry of the sur-
face. Therefore, this formula is a very explicit and very pure expression of (and proof of!) Gauss’s
Theorema Egregium.
There is a reason that the simplicity of this computational proof rivals that of our geometrical
proof in [27.4]—it is, fundamentally, the same proof!
To begin to understand this, ﬁrst observe that the intrinsic connection form ω12 tells us about
the rotation of (m1, m2) within the surface, relative to a parallel-transported vector. Since this is the
opposite of the rotation δR of a parallel-transported vector relative to the frame, this explains why
(38.34) is simply the negative of our original, geometrically derived formula, (27.5), page 267.
The ﬁnal step of the geometrical proof was to ﬁnd the holonomy of a vector that was parallel-
transported around a small closed loop. But, as we learned in (37.8), page 408, this integral of ω12
around a small loop is precisely what is measured by dω12.
38.9
A New Curvature Formula
We now derive a new curvature formula that will enable us to reach new results. With the Theorema
Egregium (re)established, we may revert to denoting the curvature of the surface as K, since the
extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures are in fact one and the same.
We will now show that
K = ∇m2

ω12(m1)

38.10 Hilbert’s Lemma
•
453
To avoid clutter, let us write the components of ω12 as f1 and f2, so that (38.32) takes the form
ω12 = f1 θ1 + f2 θ2,
where
f1 = ω12(m1) = dθ1(m1, m2)
and
f2 = ω12(m2) = dθ2(m1, m2).
If we apply the 2-form dω12 to the pair of basis vectors, (m1, m2), then the Gauss Equation
(38.30) yields,
K
=
−dω12(m1, m2)
=
−
[
df1 ∧θ1 + f1 dθ1 + df2 ∧θ2 + f2 dθ2]
(m1, m2)
=
df1(m2) −df2(m1) −f2
1 −f2
2
=
∇m2f1 −∇m1f2 −f2
1 −f2
2.
which is, indeed, the desired formula, (38.36).
38.10 Hilbert’s Lemma
Hilbert showed that if a point p on a surface has the following three properties, then the curvature
of the surface cannot be positive at p:





κ1 has local maximum at p
κ2 has local minimum at p
κ1(p) > κ2(p)





=⇒
K(p) ⩽0.
(38.37)
For example, these conditions are realized at each point on the inner equator of a torus, and
the curvature at these points is indeed negative, in accord with Hilbert’s Lemma.
Since p is a critical point for κ1 and for κ2, at p we have
∇m2κ1 = 0 = ∇m1κ2.
(38.38)
Also, since κ1 achieves a local maximum at p, and κ2 achieves a local minimum at p,
∇m2∇m2κ1 ⩽0
and
∇m1∇m1κ2 ⩾0.
(38.39)
Since (κ1 −κ2) > 0, inserting (38.38) into the Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equations (38.28)
and (38.29), we ﬁnd that, at p,
ω12(m1) = 0 = ω12(m2).
(38.40)
Thus, the curvature formula (38.36) reduces to
K = ∇m2
[
ω12(m1)
]
−∇m1
[
ω12(m2)
]
.
(38.41)
Differentiating (38.28) and inserting (38.40),
∇m2∇m2κ1
=
[
∇m2(κ1 −κ2)
]
ω12(m1) + (κ1 −κ2) ∇m2
[
ω12(m1)
]
=
(κ1 −κ2) ∇m2
[
ω12(m1)
]
.

454
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
[38.7] These two kinds of surfaces have constant positive curvature, and the same intrinsic geometry as a sphere,
but they are clearly not spherical!
Finally, since (κ1 −κ2) > 0, (38.39) implies
∇m2
[
ω12(m1)
]
⩽0.
Applying the same logic to the other Peterson–Mainardi–Codazzi Equation, (38.29), we ﬁnd
∇m1
[
ω12(m2)
]
⩾0.
Inserting the previous two inequalities into the curvature formula (38.41), the lemma is
proved.
38.11 Liebmann’s Rigid Sphere Theorem
Recall that Minding’s Theorem of 1839 (proved in Ex. 7, p. 336) implies that if a surface S has
constant positive curvature K, then its intrinsic metric geometry must be identical to that of a
sphere of radius 1/
√
K, at least locally.
It is tempting to go further, speculating that S must actually be part of a sphere, manifesting
the completely symmetrical extrinsic geometry of a sphere, in which every point is an umbilic
point: κ1 = κ2. In fact, in the following, we shall take it as given that this condition does indeed
characterize the sphere.
However, such a guess would be incorrect: [38.7] depicts two kinds of surfaces that are very
deﬁnitely not spherical, and yet which both have constant positive curvature, and the same intrinsic
geometry as a sphere! (For the equations of these surfaces, see Ex. 7, p. 336.)
We can also see this experimentally. Take a ping pong ball and cut it in half; now gently
squeeze together antipodal points on the equator. The surface will ﬂex without stretching, creating
a new, nonspherical surface of constant positive curvature, and the same intrinsic geometry as the
original sphere.
But what if we try to ﬂex a complete ping pong ball? It would appear that we cannot! Minding
himself had ﬁrst speculated about this issue in 1839, but it took another 60 years before Heinrich

38.12 The Curvature 2-Forms of an n-Manifold
•
455
Liebmann was ﬁnally able to prove (in 1899) that a closed (bounded) surface of constant curvature
embedded in R3 can only be a sphere.
Thus, if the geometry is intrinsically uniform (in the sense of constant K), then the extrinsic
geometry can also only be the extrinsically uniform geometry of a sphere, and therefore the sphere
cannot be deformed into any other extrinsic shapes—a complete sphere is rigid.
The best known proof of Liebmann’s Theorem was discovered, not long afterwards, by David
Hilbert,13 and the crucial ingredient of his proof was (38.37), hence its name—“Hilbert’s Lemma.”
We begin by observing that since S is bounded, its constant curvature must be positive curva-
ture. By deﬁnition, being bounded means that S can be enclosed within a sufﬁciently large sphere.
Now shrink the sphere till it ﬁrst touches S, at c, say. Then the little piece of S surrounding c all lies
on one side of the common tangent plane to S and the sphere at c. Thus c must be an elliptic point
of positive curvature, and since the curvature is assumed to be constant, it is positive everywhere
on S.
Let us assume that on a closed (bounded) surface the function κ1 must achieve a maximum.
(A proof can be found in O’Neill (2006, pp. 185–186).) Since K = κ1κ2 is assumed to be constant,
κ2 must achieve a minimum at a point at which κ1 achieves a maximum. But this means that it
is impossible that κ1 > κ2. For, if that were the case, Hilbert’s Lemma would demand that K ⩽0,
contradicting the fact that the surface has (constant) positive curvature.
Thus κ1(p) = κ2(p). And since κ1(p) is the maximum of κ1 on S, and κ2(p) is the minimum of
κ2 on S, this means that κ1 = κ2 at every point of S, and therefore S is a sphere.
38.12 The Curvature 2-Forms of an n-Manifold
38.12.1 Introduction and Summary
Recall the scene as the curtain rose on Act I of our drama. The ﬂatness of the Euclidean plane R2
was characterized by the following property of of an arbitrary triangle ∆constructed within it:
Angle sum of ∆= π.
(38.42)
If this equation is not satisﬁed, it means that ∆lives within a surface that is curved.
The situation is analogous to the juxtaposition of Newton’s First and Second Laws of Motion:
if we observe an object that is not moving at constant speed in a straight line, there must be a force
acting upon it. And the magnitude of the force manifests itself as the acceleration, that is, as the
difference between the actual motion and force-free, constant-speed, straight-line motion.
Likewise, the amount of curvature within the surface is quantiﬁed by the difference between
the two sides of the equation above. This is the angular excess, E:
E(∆) ≡(Angle sum of ∆) −π.
(38.43)
When applied to a small (ultimately vanishing) triangle, this allows us to quantify the curvature K
at the triangle ∆, of area A(∆), by means of this fundamental formula:
E(∆) ≍K A(∆).
(38.44)
13Liebmann completed his doctoral work at Göttingen, but not as Hilbert’s student. Yet one senses, perhaps, some jealousy on
the part of Hilbert, for he writes that Liebmann proved the theorem “at my urging” (Hilbert 1902, p. 197). In any event, it is
Hilbert’s proof (given here) of Liebmann’s theorem that lives on!

Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
Now let us move up a dimension, to 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3. As we will prove, the
analogue of (38.42) turns out to be none other than Cartan’s Second Structural Equation, (38.12)—this
equation characterizes the ﬂatness of the space:
d[ω] = [ω] ∧[ω].
In a curved n-manifold, this equation does not hold, and the difference between the two sides
of the equation once again quantiﬁes the curvature of the space. The analogue of (38.43) is now a
matrix [Ω] of 2-forms, called the curvature matrix:
[Ω] ≡d[ω] −[ω] ∧[ω].
(38.45)
The individual entries within this matrix are called14 the
Curvature 2-forms:
Ωij = dωij −∑
k ωik ∧ωkj.
(38.46)
It is this (fully general) equation that is usually referred to (in more advanced works) as
Cartan’s Second Structural Equation; in R3 it reduces to our original version, (38.13), for in that
case Ωij = 0.
IMPORTANT NOTATIONAL NOTE: Two different notations exist in the literature for both the
connection 1-forms and the curvature 2-forms. In the more common notation, which we too shall
adopt shortly, both these objects have one raised index and one lowered index. As we shall explain,
the relation between the notations is, ωi
j ≡ωji and Ωi
j ≡Ωji. This reversal of the order of the
indices has the effect that in both (38.45) and (38.46) the “−” becomes a “+”.
We will prove that these curvature 2-forms contain exactly the same information as the Riemann
tensor, but packaged in a more compact and elegant form [sic].
For your convenience, we repeat here the deﬁnitions of the Riemann tensor R and of the
Riemann curvature operator R, both of which are stated in (29.8), page 290:
R(u, v; w) = R(u, v) w =
{
[∇u , ∇v] −∇[u, v]
}
w.
(38.47)
Recall that in Chapter 29 we never actually worked out the generalization of the “Star Trek
phaser” formula (27.1) for an n-manifold. That is, we never found a formula for the Riemann
tensor explicitly expressed directly in terms of the metric coefﬁcients. There is such a formula—
it’s ugly and it’s complicated, involving things called Christoffel symbols, and it can be found in
every standard textbook on Riemannian Geometry—but we chose not to derive that formula for a
good reason: we can do better!
14Multiple notations exist for the curvature 2-forms. Our Ωij is probably the most common, and it was the notation originally
used by Cartan (1927) himself, but Flanders (1989) and Chern et al. (1999) instead use Θij, while Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
(1973) use Rij.

38.12 The Curvature 2-Forms of an n-Manifold
•
457
The curvature 2-forms allow us to calculate the Riemann tensor much more efﬁciently and
cleanly than any frontal assault could ever hope to achieve. Formula (38.46) allows us to calculate
Ωij, and then we simply read off the components of the Riemann tensor, for we shall prove that they
are simply the components of the curvature 2-forms! That is,
Ωij = Rijkl θk ∧θl.
(38.48)
NOTE: Here, and in the following, we have reverted to the Einstein summation convention: sum-
mation over the matching k-indices and l-indices is understood. However, we assume that the sum
is over distinct basis 2-forms, or else we would require a factor of (1/2).
38.12.2 The Generalized Exterior Derivative
Calculating the Riemann tensor via the curvature 2-forms, as deﬁned in (38.46), only requires
routine exterior differentiation of the connection 1-forms. However, in order to reach the formula
(38.48), we shall need to generalize the action of d beyond Forms.
First, though, let us introduce an alternative notation for the connection 1-forms in which one
index is raised and one is lowered: ωi
j. This notation will not only allow us to reinstate the use
of the Einstein summation convention, but, more importantly, it will also enable you to make an
easy transition to studying such works as Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), Frankel (2012),
Dray (2015), and Tu (2017), all of whom employ this notation.
These ωi
j are deﬁned so that (38.4) now takes the form
∇vmj = ∑
i ωji(v) mi ≡∑
i ωi
j(v) mi = ωi
j(v) mi,
(38.49)
in which the ﬁnal equality signals the return to the Einstein summation convention—the sum over
the matching pair or i-indices (one up and one down) is understood.
Note the reversal of the order of the indices!15
ωi
j ≡ωji.
(38.50)
Now let us try to generalize the exterior derivative d, deﬁning its action upon the moving
frame ﬁeld vectors, mi. By analogy with
df(v) = ∇vf,
let us deﬁne,
dmj(v) ≡∇vmj = ωi
j(v) mi.
Abstracting away the arbitrary vector v,
dmj = ωi
j mi.
15I do not understand the origin of this choice, and I do not welcome it, but it is the standard notation, so we shall abide by it!

458
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
This now allows us to apply d to a general vector ﬁeld, w = wj mj. Renaming indices as we
go, we ﬁnd that
dw = d
[
wj mj
]
=
[
dwj]
mj + wj dmj = mi
(
dwi + ωi
j wj)
.
Now let us differentiate again.
Wait!—isn’t d2 = 0?! No, d2 vanishes when it is applied to Forms, but not now! Renaming
indices as we go, we ﬁnd,
d2w
=
dmk ∧
(
dwk + ωk
j wj)
+ mi
(
d2wi + wj dωi
j −ωi
j ∧dwj)
=
ωi
k mi ∧
(
dwk + ωk
i wi)
+ mi
(
wj dωi
j −ωi
k ∧dwk)
=
mi
(
dωi
j + ωi
k ∧ωk
j
)
wj.
Thus,
d2w = mi Ωi
j wj,
(38.51)
where Ωi
j are, again, the
Curvature 2-Forms:
Ωi
j = dωi
j + ωi
k ∧ωk
j.
(38.52)
IMPORTANT NOTATIONAL NOTE: Observe that there is an unfortunate sign discrepancy
between this formula for the 2-forms and our original deﬁnition, (38.46). This discrepancy arises
from (38.50):
Ωij = dωij −∑
k ωik ∧ωkj = dωj
i −∑
k ωk
i ∧ωj
k = dωj
i + ∑
k ωj
k ∧ωk
i = Ωj
i.
Likewise, note that the sign also changes in the formula (38.45) for the curvature matrix:
[Ωi
j] = d[ω] + [ω] ∧[ω].
(38.53)
Likewise, the new notation ﬂips the sign in Cartan’s First Structural Equation, so that (38.11)
now becomes
dθi = −ωi
j ∧θj.
(38.54)
Henceforth, we shall only employ Ωi
j, given by (38.52), for this is the most common
expression of the curvature 2-forms found in the literature.

38.12 The Curvature 2-Forms of an n-Manifold

38.12.3 Extracting the Riemann Tensor from the Curvature 2-Forms
Recall our very ﬁrst formula (on p. 393) for the exterior derivative of a 1-form, (36.2):
dφ(u, v) = ∇uφ(v) −∇vφ(u) −φ
([u, v]
)
.
We now generalize this by substituting dw in place of φ, recalling that
dw(v) = ∇vw.
Thus,
d2w(u, v)
=
∇udw(v) −∇vdw(u) −dw
([u, v]
)
=
∇u∇vw −∇v∇uw −∇[u, v]w
=
R(u, v) w,
by virtue of (38.47).
Combining this with (38.52), we have obtained a remarkable formula for the Riemann tensor
in terms of the curvature 2-forms:
Ri
jkl θk ∧θl = Ωi
j = dωi
j + ωim ∧ωm
j.
(38.55)
We obtained this formula by climbing the ladder of the generalized exterior derivative, but,
having arrived in the promised land, we may now toss the ladder aside! For this ﬁnal for-
mula (38.55) uses nothing more than the ordinary exterior derivative applied to the connection
1-forms.
Thus we are now in the possession of an elegant and extraordinarily powerful method of
computing the Riemann tensor using curvature 2-forms. We shall end our drama by applying this
method to a speciﬁc example of enormous physical importance.
38.12.4 The Bianchi Identities Revisited
Both the First (Algebraic) Bianchi Identity (29.15) and the Second (Differential) Bianchi Identity
(29.17) can be very elegantly derived, and compactly expressed, using our shiny new curvature
2-forms.
Since the basis 1-forms θi are ordinary 1-forms, d2 annihilates them, yielding a vanishing
3-form. Thus, differentiating Cartan’s First Structural Equation, (38.54),
0
=
−ddθi

=

j ∧θj
=
(
dωi
j + ωi
k ∧ωk
j
)
∧θj
=
Ωi
j ∧θj.
Thus, employing the more compact matrix notation, we have obtained the

460
•
Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
(First) Algebraic Bianchi Identity:
[
Ω
]
∧
[
θ
]
= 0.
(38.56)
In its present form, this is certainly unrecognizable as the original First (Algebraic) Bianchi
Identity (29.15)! To see that these two identities are, in fact, one and the same, we invoke (38.55):
0 = Ωi
j ∧θj = Ri
jkl θj ∧θk ∧θl,
and this does indeed imply [exercise] the equivalent [exercise] of (29.15):
Ri
jkl + Ri
klj + Ri
ljk = 0.
The Second (Differential) Bianchi Identity (29.17) can be obtained similarly, by applying d2 to
the connection 1-forms. Thus, differentiating Cartan’s Second Structural Equation, (38.52),
0
=
ddωi
j
=
d
(
Ωi
j −ωi

)
=

Thus, employing the more compact matrix notation, we have obtained the
(Second) Differential Bianchi Identity:

(38.57)
Again, (38.55) provides the explicit link to the Riemann tensor that enables one to see that
this is indeed equivalent [exercise] to our original version of the Differential Bianchi Identity,
(29.17).
38.13 The Curvature of the Schwarzschild Black Hole
This section lowers the curtain on Act V, bringing our long drama to its end. It does so by applying
the foregoing ideas to a mathematical and physical object of cosmic importance: the spacetime
curvature of a black hole!
Speciﬁcally, we shall endeavour to verify that the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, given
by16 (38.58), which we repeat here,
16As we explained in the context of Maxwell’s Equations, we have now reversed the sign of the metric coefﬁcients, in order to
bring our work into line with the majority of General Relativity texts that we recommend in the Further Reading section at the
end of this book.

(38.60)
Let us label each basis 1-form with its associated spacetime coordinate. Then the Schwarzs-
child metric (38.58) may be written:

In place of the more famous Occam’s Razor, let us invoke (and simultaneously christen18) the

vanish.

ϑ = 0.
There are six independent curvature 2-forms, and we now spell out (in detail) the calculation
of the ﬁrst of these, leaving it to you to verify the remaining ﬁve.
The ﬁrst step in calculating dωi
j is to revert to expressing ωi
j in terms of the dxi; this makes
it easy to calculate the exterior derivative. The ﬁnal result is then expressed in terms of θi ∧θj.

him!

Comparing the formulas above for Ωi

these formulas are in perfect accord with the formulas (30.2) and (30.3) (p. 312) that we deduced
from the tidal forces arising from Newton’s Inverse-Square Law of Gravitation!
We have arrived at a moment of high drama: Is this putative black hole spacetime geometry
physically possible—does it satisfy the Einstein Vacuum Field Equation? Let us ﬁnd out!
Summing the relevant Riemann tensor components to ﬁnd the Ricci tensor, we easily see that
the off-diagonal components of the Ricci tensor vanish, and, using (38.60), we now calculate its
diagonal components, as follows:

Thus the black hole geometry discovered by Leftenant Schwarzschild
in December of 1915, written down in his World War I trench on the
Russian front, is indeed an exact solution of the equation that Einstein
had discovered one month earlier!

Chapter 38 Differential Geometry via Forms
To be clear, Schwarzschild had no idea at the time that his discovery represented a black
hole. For him, and for Einstein, it only represented the spacetime geometry surrounding ordinary
celestial bodies, such as the Earth or the Sun. It would take another half-century before physicists
ﬁnally grasped that this solution, in its entirety, also presents the pure vacuum gravitational ﬁeld
of a black hole.
In January 1965, ten years after Einstein’s death, Roger Penrose proved for the ﬁrst time that
Einstein’s theory mathematically implies that the collapse of a sufﬁciently massive body must
necessarily result in the formation of a black hole.20 For this discovery, Penrose was awarded half
of the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics; the other half was divided equally between Reinhard Genzel
and Andrea Ghez, for their independent experimental discovery of the supermassive black hole
(Sagittarius A*) at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy.
Before our long Mathematical Drama ﬁnally comes to its end, and the curtain falls, we have
one last trick up our sleeve. Why did we insist on expressing the curvature in terms of f, f′, and
f′′ till the bitter end, despite the fact that their values were known to us from the very beginning,
on full display in (38.60)?
Instead of “merely” verifying that Schwarzschild’s geometry solves Einstein’s equation, we
can instead deduce it from Einstein’s equation!
Einstein’s Field Equation implies
Rϕϕ = Rϑϑ = −f′
r + 1 −f
r2
= 0
=⇒
df
dr = 1 −f
r
=⇒
f(r) = 1 −C
r ,
where C is a constant.
But then the remaining diagonal components of the Ricci tensor automatically vanish, too,
thereby conﬁrming that we have successfully solved Einstein’s equation:
Rtt = −Rrr = f′′
2 + f′
r = −C
r3 + C
r3 = 0.
It remains to understand why the constant C is tied to the mass21 of the black hole by
C = 2GM. But to explain this would require that we delve much deeper into the fascinating world
of gravitational physics than this Mathematical Drama will permit us to venture.
20In fact what Penrose proved was that the collapse must result in the formation of a spacetime singularity. But, in principle,
this singularity could be something far more terrifying than a black hole—it could be a so-called naked singularity, visible to
the outside world! In 1969, Penrose conjectured that this could never happen, and that a “Cosmic Censor” would insist that
every singularity be respectably clothed inside an event horizon, thereby forming a black hole! Many theoretical arguments
lend credence to this Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis, but it remains unproven in 2020.
21This connection can be established by a variety of arguments, and it is treated in all of the General Relativity texts we
recommend in the Further Reading section at the end of this book. However, perhaps the single best, most physical treatment of
the topic can be found in Schutz (2003, §§18, 21).

Exercises for Act V
1-Forms
1. Dirac Delta Function as 1-Form. (This example is adapted from Schutz 1980.) Consider the
vector space C[−1, +1] of inﬁnitely differentiable, real-valued functions f(x) deﬁned on the
interval −1 ⩽x ⩽+1. The dual space of 1-forms is called the distributions. An example of
such a distribution is the Dirac Delta Function δ(x), which is the 1-form whose action on the
“vector” f(x) produces its value at x = 0:
⟨δ(x), f(x)⟩= f(0).
As we now explain, this is not at all how Paul Dirac (1930) himself originally introduced his
delta function into quantum mechanics.
(i) For any function g(x) in C[−1, +1], deﬁne a corresponding 1-form eg(x) such that its action
on the vector f(x) is given by
⟨eg(x), f(x)⟩≡
∫+1
−1
g(x) f(x) dx.
Prove that eg is indeed a 1-form.
(ii) Thus Dirac actually deﬁned his delta function by insisting that
∫+1
−1
δ(x) f(x) dx = f(0).
(39.1)
No ordinary function δ(x) can do this, but consider a smooth, bell-shaped curve centred
at 0, and imagine it growing higher and higher as it becomes narrower and narrower, all
the while obeying (39.1), with f(x) = 1:
∫+1
−1
δ(x) 1 dx = 1.
Explain why, in the limit that the width of the bell curve vanishes, we recover (39.1).
2. In R3, give an explicit geometrical interpretation of the action ω(v) of the 1-form ω = 2 dx +
dy + 2 dz on the vector v.
3. Explanation of Covariant and Contravariant. Let Rθ denote a rotation of R2 by θ. Then, as
explained in [15.3], page 153, its matrix is
[Rθ] =
"
c
−s
s
c
#
,
with inverse
[Rθ]−1 = [R−θ] = [Rθ]T =
"
c

c
#
,
where c ≡cos θ and s ≡sin θ. Let {e1, e2} be the standard Cartesian basis, and let {ee1,ee2} be the
new basis that results from rotating the old basis by θ, so that eej = Rθej.

Chapter 39 Exercises for Act V
(i) Draw both bases in the same picture, and also draw a general vector v = vjej, and draw
its components evj in the rotated basis: v =evjeej. Use your picture to explain why the new
components are obtained by applying the opposite rotation matrix [Rθ]−1 to the original
components:
"
ev1
ev2
#
= [Rθ]−1
"
v1
v2
#
.
Because the components vary in the opposite (“contra-”) way to the basis vectors, in the
older literature a vector is called contravariant.
(ii) The dual basis of {e1, e2} is {dx1, dx2}. Let φ = φj dxj be a general 1-form, and let {eω1, eω2}
be the basis dual to {ee1,ee2}, so that the new components are given by φ = eφj eωj. Show
that the components of the 1-form transform in the same (“co-”) way as the basis vectors:
"
eφ1
eφ2
#
= [Rθ]
"
φ1
φ2
#
.
For this reason, 1-forms used to be called covariant vectors, or covectors. (NOTE: Mod-
ern Differential Geometry focuses on (coordinate-independent) geometric objects, which
are unchanged by basis transformations such as this one. For this reason, the terms
contravariant and covariant have largely disappeared from the modern literature. For
an excellent, fully general discussion of this topic, see Schutz (1980, §2.26).)

15. Hodge Star Duality Operator (⋆) (For a fully general discussion of this concept, see Schutz
(1980), Baez and Muniain (1994), or Dray (2015). In particular, Baez and Muniain (1994, §§1, 5)
contains an excellent discussion of the relation of Hodge duality to Maxwell’s equations.)
(i) In n dimensions, show that the space of p-forms has the same dimension as the space
of (n −p)-forms. These two spaces can therefore be put into 1-to-1 correspondence, and
Hodge duality is a speciﬁc method of accomplishing this.
(ii) In R3, let V3 = dx ∧dy ∧dz be the volume 3-form. Given a basis p-form σ, we deﬁne ⋆
to be the linear operator that ﬁlls in the “missing pieces” of V3:
σ ∧⋆σ = V3.
Deduce that
⋆dx
=
dy ∧dz,
⋆dy
=
dz ∧dx,
⋆dz
=
dx ∧dy,
and, symmetrically, deduce that
⋆(dy ∧dz)
=
dx,
⋆(dz ∧dx)
=
dy,
⋆(dx ∧dy)
=
dz.
Thus, in this case, two applications of the Hodge star operator yields the identity: ⋆⋆= 1.
Finally, in the interest of completeness, it is natural to deﬁne
⋆1 = V3
and
⋆V3 = 1.
(iii) Continuing in R3, we remind you of our earlier notation: φ is the vector corresponding
(⇄) to the 1-form φ. Show that Hodge duality yields two forms of the vector (cross)
product:
α × β = γ
⇐⇒
α ∧β = ⋆γ
⇐⇒
⋆(α ∧β) = γ.
(iv) Still in R3, recall that every 2-form Ψ can be thought of as the ﬂux associated with a ﬂow
of velocity Ψ, via (34.10):
Ψ = Ψ1 (dx2 ∧dx3) + Ψ2 (dx3 ∧dx1) + Ψ3 (dx1 ∧dx2)

If ψ is the 1-form corresponding to Ψ, deduce that the correspondence between Ψ and ψ

⋆Ψ = ψ

Ψ = ⋆ψ.
(v) Now consider Minkowski spacetime, with metric
ds2 = gij dxi dxj = −dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
NOTE: Here, and henceforth, the metric coefﬁcients gij are the negatives of those used
earlier in Act II, for this is the convention favoured by the majority of more advanced
physics texts we shall refer to, going forward.
Let the volume 4-form be V4 = dx ∧dy ∧dz ∧dt, and deﬁne ⋆dxi by
dxi ∧⋆dxi = gii V4.
Deduce that
⋆dt = dx ∧dy ∧dz = V3,
⋆dx = dy ∧dz ∧dt,
⋆dy = dz ∧dx ∧dt,
⋆dz = dx ∧dy ∧dt.
(vi) Still in Minkowski spacetime, we deﬁne the dual ⋆Ψ of a basis 2-form Ψ by
Ψ ∧⋆Ψ = ±V4,
in which we choose minus (−) if Ψ contains dt, and we choose plus (+) otherwise. (Note
that this rule encompasses the rule in the previous part as a special case.) Deduce that
⋆(dx ∧dt) = −dy ∧dz,
⋆(dy ∧dz) = dx ∧dt,
⋆(dy ∧dt) = −dz ∧dx,
⋆(dz ∧dx) = dy ∧dt,
⋆(dz ∧dt) = −dx ∧dy,
⋆(dx ∧dy) = dz ∧dt.
(vii) Verify that for 2-forms in Minkowski spacetime, ⋆⋆= −1. (This is in fact true of all
p-forms.)
(viii) Recall that the Faraday 2-form is given by (34.22):
F = Faraday = ε ∧dt + B.
Use the previous parts to deduce that the Maxwell 2-form (34.26) is indeed the Hodge
dual of the Faraday 2-form:
⋆F = Maxwell = β ∧dt −E.

HISTORICAL NOTE: Faraday’s 1831 experimental discovery of electromagnetic induction was
ultimately crystalized by Maxwell into mathematical form: a changing magnetic ﬁeld gener-
ates curl in the electric ﬁeld—see (37.13). Thirty years later, without any experimental evidence,
the purely theoretical considerations of this exercise forced Maxwell to conclude, in 1861,
that, symmetrically, a changing electric ﬁeld must generate curl in the magnetic ﬁeld. Without
this symmetry, electromagnetic waves could not exist—Let there be light!
17. Spinning Photons and Self-Duality. In Minkowski spacetime, a complex 2-form Ψ is called
self-dual if

where ⋆is the Hodge duality operator introduced in Exercise 15.
(i) Let us verify that the Faraday 2-form F (or any 2-form, for that matter) can always be

22. Hairy Ball Theorem. (From do Carmo (1994).) As we discussed in connection with [19.8], the
Poincaré–Hopf Theorem (19.6) implies that there cannot exist a singularity-free vector ﬁeld
on S2. This is often called the Hairy Ball Theorem: we cannot comb the hair on a coconut!
Here is a second proof, using FTEC. Suppose that such a nonvanishing ﬁeld v exists, and use
it to construct the ﬁrst vector m1 = v/|v| of an orthonormal basis {m1, m2}. Then the Gauss

dω12 = −θ1 ∧θ2 = −A.
Now use FTEC to integrate this equation over S2, thereby obtaining a contradiction.

26. Curvature 2-Forms of a 2-Surface. Let {m1, m2} be an orthonormal basis ﬁeld for tangent
vectors v to a 2-surface, so that
∇vm1 = −ω12(v) m2
∇vm2 =

Thus, the curvature matrix is completely described by the single curvature 2-form Ω12,
governed by the Gauss Equation:
Ω12 = dω12 = KA.

28. Cosmic Curvature. (The detailed solution to this exercise can be found in Dray (2015, §A.9)
and in Sternberg (2012, §6.7).) The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) solu-
tions of Einstein’s Field Equations are now considered the standard model for the large-scale
geometry of our expanding Universe. They were ﬁrst discovered by Alexander Friedmann
in 1922, rediscovered by the Jesuit priest, Georges Lemaître in 1927, and in 1935 Robert-
son and Walker jointly proved their uniqueness as the spatially homogeneous and isotropic
geometries that are possible for the Universe.
Friedmann sought and found solutions of the original Einstein Equation, whereas we
now know that the Cosmological Einstein Equation (30.25) is in fact correct, with cosmo-
logical constant Λ > 0. Fortunately, it is possible to adapt Friedmann’s discovery to this new
reality.

where R(t) measures the size of the expanding Universe at time t after the big bang, and
K is the constant spatial curvature of the Universe for all time. See Penrose (2005, §§27.11,
27.12) for an excellent discussion (and lovely drawings) of the three cases, K > 0, K = 0, K < 0,
including the effect of Λ > 0.
By following in the footsteps of our calculation of the curvature of the Schwarzschild
black hole, write down the basis 1-forms, θi, take their exterior derivatives to ﬁnd the con-
nection 1-forms, ωi

j, and ﬁnally deduce the curvature 2-forms Ωi
j of
such a Universe.

NOTES: In the following, I merely list title and author; full details can be found in the bibliography.
Some of the following works are included simply because they are highly relevant, and I therefore
believe they deserve to be brought to your attention (even if they are not quite my cup of tea).
Most, however, are included because I consider them to be gems, and I strongly recommend them
to you. Many other excellent books sit on my bookshelves, and I seek their counsel often, and yet
they are not included here simply in order to cut down this (already long) list to a manageable
size—I apologize to the authors of all those excellent works for failing to highlight them here.
Finally, I also apologize to the authors of the wonderful works I have yet to discover!
Global Recommendations
First, let me set the stage with six works that I hold to be invaluable, the content of each of which
spans multiple Acts of this book.
•
The Road to Reality, by Roger Penrose.
An extraordinary panorama of almost all of physics, and most of mathematics, by a master of
both. Many of the insights can only be found here, and they are brought to life by Penrose’s
remarkable (and beautiful!) hand drawings.
•
Gravitation, by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler.
Almost 50 years after its original publication in 1973, this classic remains one of the very
best introductions to Einstein’s geometrical theory of gravity (General Relativity) and to the
Differential Geometry upon which it rests. It also contains one of the best, most geometrical
introductions to Forms, including the curvature 2-forms that allow one to calculate the Rie-
mann tensor efﬁciently. The new (2017) edition from Princeton University Press is beautifully
done, and contains a new introduction by Charles Misner and Kip Thorne, discussing the
exciting developments in the ﬁeld since the book’s original publication.
•
Differential Geometry in the Large, by Heinz Hopf.
Hopf was not only one of the towering ﬁgures of twentieth-century mathematics, he was also
a master of exposition. Here, ideas of Differential Geometry and Topology (many of which
are due to Hopf himself) come together in a beautiful way, explained with remarkable clarity
and simplicity. Every time I return to this Meisterwerk, I feel that some beneﬁcent magician
has inserted more wonderful ideas into its pages, for I swear that this beautiful idea wasn’t on
the page the last time I looked!
•
Elementary Differential Geometry (revised 2nd edition), by Barrett O’Neill.
First published in 1966, this trail-blazing text pioneered the use of Forms at the undergraduate
level. Today, more than a half-century later, O’Neill’s work remains, in my view, the single
most clear-eyed, elegant, and (ironically) modern treatment of the subject available—present
company excepted!—at the undergraduate level.

Geometrical Methods of Mathematical Physics, by Bernard Schutz.
This work—now 40 years old!—is a timeless treasure trove, covering manifolds, tensors, Lie
derivatives and Lie groups, Forms, Riemannian Geometry, gauge theories, and a host of other
applications to physics. To achieve this, Professor Schutz channels Star Trek’s Mr. Spock. His
Vulcan half enables him to erect a logical structure of crystalline perfection, in which every-
thing is concisely and rigorously proven, and—unlike my (I hope delicious) cheeseburger
approach in this book—Kashrut is strictly observed: concepts that depend on the existence of
a metric are scrupulously and explicitly separated from those that do not. But, in tandem with
this, Schutz is able to harness his human half to provide a wealth of intuition that reveals the
underlying geometric reality.
•
Mathematics and Its History (3rd edition), by John Stillwell.
A remarkable panorama of all of mathematics through the lens of history. But make no mis-
take, this is not primarily a book about history, rather it is fundamentally a work about the
interconnectedness and meaning of mathematics itself, all explained in a rather concise style
(relative to mine!), with deep insight and lucidity.
Geometry in General
The following works are concerned with geometry in general, but especially with Hyperbolic
Geometry. (Differential Geometry has its own category.)
•
Geometry and the Imagination, by David Hilbert and S. Cohn-Vossen.
A magniﬁcent, deeply insightful survey of geometry, focusing on intuitive understanding,
by one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. The diagrams (drawn by K. H.
Naumann and H. Bödeker) are astonishingly beautiful, to the point of causing me envy!
•
Experiencing Geometry, by David W. Henderson and Daina Taimina.
A highly unusual approach, philosophically akin to mine (but using the Moore method),
focused on intuitive, experimental investigations of geometry. It contains signiﬁcant discussion
of parallel transport and holonomy. The overlap of their approach with mine is made clear
by this quotation from the preface: “This book is based on a view of proof as a convincing
communication that answers—Why?” (Their italics.)
•
Introduction to Geometry (2nd edition), by H.S.M. Coxeter.
A wonderfully clear survey by a modern master.
•
Geometry, by Brannan, Esplen, and Gray.
An excellent modern survey of geometry, based on Klein’s vision of groups of transfor-
mations.
•
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: Development and History,
by Marvin J. Greenberg.
A valuable, detailed history of the development of Hyperbolic Geometry, including lengthy
quotations from critical, private letters of Gauss, Bolyai, and many others.
•
The Poincaré Half-Plane, by Saul Stahl.
The title says it all.

•
477
•
Geometry Revealed, by Marcel Berger.
A much more advanced survey of geometry, with a focus on conceptual proofs and unsolved
problems, by one of the great geometers of the 20th century.
Topology
•
Intuitive Topology, by V. V. Prasolov.
Less than 100 pages long, and ﬁlled with diagrams, this super-friendly introduction lives up
to its title!
•
Euler’s Gem, by David S. Richeson.
A masterful, mathematically accurate, yet riveting account of Euler’s polyhedral formula, its
history and the connected mathematical ideas.
•
Surface Topology, by P. A. Firby and C. F. Gardiner.
A very gentle, nicely illustrated introduction to the fundamental geometric ideas of topology.
•
First Concepts of Topology, by W. G. Chinn and N. E. Steenrod.
Another very gentle, nicely illustrated introduction to the fundamental geometric ideas of
topology.
•
Topology: A Very Short Introduction, by Richard Earl
This remarkable little book lives up to its title, covering a huge range of fundamental ideas
in just 140 pages, and it does so in a very clear, elementary, informal style. This is my new
favourite introduction to the subject.
•
The Shape of Space (3rd edition), by Jeffrey R. Weeks.
A wonderfully lucid, engaging, elementary treatment of the topology of two and three dimen-
sional spaces. The last of the four parts of the book deals with the possibility of detecting the
topology of the Universe! An appendix contains John Horton Conway’s famous ZIP Proof of
the Classiﬁcation Theorem for surfaces, beautifully illustrated by George K. Francis.
•
Three-Dimensional Geometry and Topology, by William P. Thurston.
Thurston won the Fields Medal for discovering that 3-manifolds are fundamentally built out
of Hyperbolic Geometry. In this book you will hear Thurston’s discoveries in his own distinc-
tive voice, and although the difﬁculty of the topology accelerates rapidly, the ﬁrst 100 pages
provide a relatively elementary, highly original introduction to Hyperbolic Geometry that
should not be missed.
Hopf’s Line Fields and the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem in Physics
In this book I have sought to draw attention to line ﬁelds and Hopf’s beautiful result that the
Poincaré–Hopf Theorem applies to them, too, ((19.9), p. 213). These ideas have all but disappeared
from modern mathematics textbooks, and I strongly believe that it is past time for a revival. That
said, physicists never lost sight of the value of these ideas, and they have sustained them with
wonderful new discoveries.

Here I am forced to list research papers rather than expository textbooks. The only exposi-
tory mathematical treatments I know of are the lectures by Hopf (1956) himself (see previously),
and the book by his student, Stoker (1969). Although the latest contributions to optics explicitly
cite Hopf’s work—going so far as to call fractional indices “Hopf indices”—these ideas were pio-
neered by J. F. Nye, and later, Sir Michael Berry, neither of whom seem to have been aware of Hopf
(1956). (NOTE: In reading these papers, it is important to understand that what mathematicians call
holonomy, physicists sometimes call anholonomy!)
•
The Topology of Ridge Systems, by Roger Penrose.
A completely elementary introduction (for nonmathematicians) to this circle of ideas, using
ﬁngerprints and palm prints as exemplars, for these are indeed line ﬁelds!
•
The Fingerprint of the Weyl Tensor, Spinors and Space-Time, Vol. 2, pp. 229–233,
by Roger Penrose.
Penrose’s “ﬁngerprint” description of the Weyl curvature tensor reveals line ﬁelds having
singularities possessing fractional indices.
•
I. Liquid Crystals. On the Theory of Liquid Crystals, by F. C. Frank.
One of the earliest appearances of line ﬁelds in physics. Note that here they are called nematic
ﬁelds and their singularities are called topological defects.
•
The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem for Line Fields Revisited,
by Diarmuid Crowley and Mark Grant.
A nice review of the history and applications of the theorem; it also includes a general proof,
in all dimensions.
•
Generic Singularities of Line Fields on 2D Manifolds,
by Ugo Boscain, Ludovic Sacchelliy, and Mario Sigalotti.
A very nice review of the many appearances of line ﬁelds in nature, and their mathematical
classiﬁcation, related to umbilic points.
•
Natural Focusing and Fine Structure of Light: Caustics and Wave Dislocations,
by J. F. Nye
Nye pioneered the introduction of line ﬁelds (polarization ﬁelds) into optics: the generic sin-
gularities are circularly polarized points in 2D or lines in 3D. Two other sorts of singularities
are analyzed: those of intensity (caustics) and phase (vortices), which were pioneered by Nye
and Sir Michael Berry.
•
The Quantum Phase, Five Years After, by M. V. Berry, in Shapere and Wilczek (1989).
A review by the discoverer of the quantum phase himself, explicitly relating the discovery
to Differential Geometry, discussing the lines of curvature surrounding umbilic points, and
making the crucial observation that a circuit around such a point results in a rotation of ±π,
corresponding to an index of ± 1
2, as illustrated in [19.14 a & A]. For a lovely illustration of
this phenomenon, see Hilbert (1952, p. 189).
•
Geometry of Phase and Polarization Singularities, Illustrated by Edge Diffraction and
the Tides, by M. V. Berry.
Edge diffraction and the tides also yield singular points with fractional indices.

•
Index Formulae for Singular Lines of Polarization, by M. V. Berry.
Formulas are obtained for the indices of lines in space on which the polarization of a
monochromatic light ﬁeld is purely circular (C) or purely linear (L). The indices (± 1
2 for C
lines and ±1 for L lines) involve the electric or magnetic ﬁeld and its derivatives on the line.
•
Polarization Singularities in the Clear Sky, by M. V. Berry, M. R. Dennis,
and R. L. Lee.
An account of the pattern of polarization directions in daylight. The singularities (two near
the Sun and two near the anti-Sun) are points in the sky where the polarization line ﬁeld
pattern has index + 1
2 and the intensity of polarization is zero.
•
A Half-Century of Physical Asymptotics and Other Diversions: Selected Works by Michael Berry,
by M. V. Berry
Sir Michael Berry’s seminal contributions to optics, focusing on revealing ubiquitous man-
ifestations of a variety of optical singularities in both everyday life and in cutting-edge,
fundamental photonic research.
•
Singularities and Poincaré Indices of Electromagnetic Multipoles,
by Weijin Chen, Yuntian Chen, and Wei Liu.
The authors map all the singularities of multipolar radiations of different orders, identify their
indices, and show explicitly that the index sum over the entire momentum sphere is always
2, consistent with the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem.
•
Global Mie Scattering: Polarization Morphologies and the Underlying Topological Invariant,
by Weijin Chen, Qingdong Yang, Yuntian Chen, and Wei Liu.
The Poincaré–Hopf Theorem (with fractional indices) is used to show that if you shine coher-
ently polarized light of any form on any particle or particle clusters, there must be one
direction where the scattering is either zero or circularly polarized.
•
Line Singularities and Hopf Indices of Electromagnetic Multipoles,
by Weijin Chen, Yuntian Chen, and Wei Liu
The paper investigates the connections between half-integer Hopf indices, electromagnetic
multipoles, and Bloch modes.
Differential Geometry
•
Differential Geometry: A Geometric Introduction, by David W. Henderson.
Of all the Differential Geometry books I will list, this one is the closest in spirit to my work,
and that is why I have placed it ﬁrst. I only discovered it late in the writing of VDGF, and
was immediately convinced that Professor Henderson was a kindred spirit, a mathematical
brother-in-arms. For the sad story of my attempt to make contact with him, see the footnote
on page 252.
•
150 Years After Gauss’ “Disquisitiones generales circa superﬁcies curvas,”

in Differential Geometry, culminating in his revolutionary, General Investigations of Curved
Surfaces, which announced the Theorema Egregium to the world. As an added bonus, Dom-
browski includes Gauss’s 1827 masterpiece in its entirety, in the original Latin, with the
English translation on facing pages.
•
A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry (Vol. 2),
by Michael Spivak
Spivak’s magnum opus actually comprises ﬁve volumes, but, for my purposes, Volume 2 is
the most relevant, for it includes detailed, insightful analysis of the pioneering investigations
of Gauss and of Riemann. This volume also includes Cartan’s method of moving frames, and
his two Structural Equations.
•
Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces (2nd edition),
by Thomas Banchoff and Stephen Lovett.
While the mathematical machinery employed here is the standard one, featuring Christoffel
symbols, and the like, it contains several highly original geometrical insights (due to Ban-
choff) that you will not ﬁnd elsewhere. Furthermore, the accompanying website contains a
wonderful array of Java applets for interactively exploring the concepts.
•
Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, by Kristopher Tapp.
One of the best, most geometrical introductions of recent years. Although the mathemati-
cal machinery is the standard one—ugly equations ﬁlled with Christoffel symbols!—there
are nevertheless many conceptual points of contact with my approach. It has many, nicely
done colour diagrams, many excellent and interesting applications, and (like this book) it
emphasizes the importance of parallel transport and holonomy. Highly recommended! (Note:
It only treats 2-surfaces, so there is no discussion of the Riemann tensor or of General
Relativity.)
•
Curved Spaces, by P.M.H. Wilson.
The ﬁrst two-thirds of the book is a concise, modern, elegant treatment of Euclidean, Spher-
ical, and Hyperbolic Geometry, employing the unifying power of Möbius transformations
(exactly as I do). The last third is an introduction to Differential Geometry.
•
A First Course in Differential Geometry: Surfaces in Euclidean Space,
by L. M. Woodward and J. Bolton.
The long ﬁnal chapter of this work is the best introduction I know of (at the undergraduate
level) to an important and beautiful topic that I have chosen to neglect entirely in this book:
minimal surfaces. Recall that these are surfaces of vanishing mean curvature, realized by soap
ﬁlms: H ≡κ1+κ2
2
= 0. The discussion includes the 1982 breakthrough discovery by Celso Costa
of new minimal surfaces (beyond planes, catenoids, and helicoids) that are closed and with-
out self-intersections. Furthermore, unusually, it also features a thorough discussion of the
generalization to the case where H = const. ̸= 0, called surfaces of constant mean curvature
(CMC surfaces).
•
Elementary Differential Geomety (2nd edition), by Andrew Pressley.
An excellent, elementary introduction, and, like the previous book, it contains a very nice
introduction to minimal surfaces.

•
A Course of Differential Geometry and Topology,
by A. Mishchenko and A. Fomenko.
An excellent, somewhat advanced, wide-ranging introduction that includes Riemannian
Geometry and Homology Theory. It is distinguished by its large number of remarkable
illustrations in the unmistakable, manga-style of Fomenko.
•
Differential Geometry: Connections, Curvature, and Characteristic Classes,
by Loring W. Tu
This is the best book I know of for making the transition from VDGF to the much more
advanced works that deal with Chern’s characteristic classes, which have become important
both in pure mathematics and in physics. The book does assume that the reader is already
familiar with Forms, but my Act V provides more than enough preparation. Tu also assumes
the reader is familiar with de Rham cohomology, and here my “primer” in Act V will likely
not be sufﬁcient, though I hope my physical and geometrical treatment—which is hard to ﬁnd
elsewhere—will greatly ease further study of the subject.
•
Lectures on Differential Geometry, by S. S. Chern, W. H. Chen, and K. S. Lam.
This book is 356 pages long, and contains fewer than 10 diagrams. I include this advanced
work for one reason, and one reason only: Chern (upon whose lectures this is based) was one
of the greatest geometers of the 20th century, and therefore anything he has to say, we should
all listen to intently. In particular, Chern includes a lengthy treatment of Finsler Geometry, a
vast generalization of Riemannian Geometry, pioneered by Chern himself. The only point of
contact with this book is that Chern employs Forms as his principal tool—no surprise, given
that Chern actually studied under Cartan himself!
Riemann’s Curvature
•
A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry, by Marcel Berger.
An invaluable, panoramic view of the subject from one of the great geometers of the 20th
century. It focuses on results and concepts, clearly and intuitively explained, and it omits all
but the most essential details.
•
Riemannian Geometry: A Beginner’s Guide (2nd edition), by Frank Morgan.
This nicely written and well-illustrated introduction packs a lot into only 129 pages. Despite
its subtitle, I suspect that a true beginner would have a much easier time tackling this work
after reading mine!
•
Riemannian Geometry, by Manfredo P. do Carmo.
An excellent (but advanced) treatment of many deep theorems, some of which are hard to
ﬁnd discussed clearly anywhere else.

Gravity from the ground up, by Bernard Schutz.
A second masterpiece! Whereas Schutz channelled Mr. Spock in his ﬁrst masterpiece (see
above), here he channels Captain Kirk! He employs true, Feynmanesque, physical, intuitive
reasoning—using only high-school mathematics—to treat all aspects of gravity. Simultane-
ously, he succeeds in painting a vivid picture of the historical, human context of our evolving
understanding of this fundamental force of Nature.
•
A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime, by John Archibald Wheeler.
A deeply insightful, largely nonmathematical, conceptual explication of Einstein’s vision, by
one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, and one of the key ﬁgures in the rebirth of
General Relativity in the 1960s: for example, it was Wheeler who coined the term black hole.
I have a personal connection with this work: having read it, I discovered and sent to Wheeler
a Newtonian, purely geometrical proof of his crucial Law of Double Curvature (p. 142). As
explained in the Prologue, Wheeler (1911–2008), whom I was fortunate to meet several times
as Penrose’s student, was a pivotal ﬁgure in my life, so I was thrilled when he wrote back that
my proof had delighted him!
•
A First Course in General Relativity (3rd edition), by Bernard Schutz.
As of this writing, the third edition does not exist, but thanks to my correspondence with its
author, I know it is coming. The second edition was already excellent, so the third edition
will only be better! In particular, I predict that the new edition will greatly expand upon the
treatment of gravitational waves, for these had not yet even been detected at the time of the
second edition, and Schutz has been a key player in the ﬁeld for more than 30 years. In 2019
Schutz received the Eddington Medal for his prescient theoretical work (Schutz 1986) that has
now provided an entirely new method of calculating the Hubble constant from gravitational
wave data.
•
Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein’s Gravity, by James B. Hartle.
One of the very best, most physical (less mathematical) introductions to Einstein’s theory,
written by a master practitioner of the theory.
•
General Relativity, by Robert M. Wald.
I view this superb work as a signiﬁcantly updated successor to Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler’s
Gravitation. It gracefully balances physical intuition with advanced mathematics, including
topics that are rarely covered in a ﬁrst course, such as Penrose’s pioneering work on 2-spinors,
and the singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking.
•
General Relativity: A Geometric Approach, by Malcolm Ludvigsen.
If you are in a hurry to master General Relativity, you can hardly do better than this. It is
a remarkably clean, elegant, geometrical, and concise presentation of the theory, but this is
achieved (miraculously) without feeling rushed.
•
Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell, by A. Zee.
An excellent introduction to General Relativity, covering many unusual topics, written in a
lively, informal, engaging, and highly opinionated style. (Are we related?)

Forms (in Mathematics)
•
A Geometric Approach to Differential Forms, by David Bachman.
One of a handful of brave books that seek to bring Forms to an undergraduate audience. And
while it does include a very brief application to Differential Geometry, it does not include any
discussion of the Riemann tensor or of General Relativity.
•
A Visual Introduction to Differential Forms and Calculus on Manifolds,
by Jon Pierre Fortney.
The most recent (and longest) book to attempt to bring Forms to an undergraduate audience.
While it does include a discussion of electromagnetism, it does not include any Differential
Geometry, and thus does not include any discussion of the Riemann tensor or of General
Relativity.
•
Differential Forms: A Heuristic Introduction, by M. Schreiber.
One of the earliest attempts to bring Forms to the masses. It contains some nice insights, but
hardly any pictures! It does not include any discussion of the Riemann tensor or of General
Relativity.
•
Differential Forms: A Complement to Vector Calculus, by Steven H. Weintraub.
As the title indicates, this is an attempt to bring Forms into the advanced undergraduate
multivariable calculus classroom. While perfectly clear, it is not geometric in ﬂavour, and has
very few pictures.
•
Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Uniﬁed Approach (4th edition),
by John H. Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard
As with the previous book, this is an attempt to bring Forms into the advanced undergraduate
multivariable calculus classroom, and here the approach is much more geometrical, rubbing
shoulders with mine. However, it must be noted that Forms only appear for the ﬁrst time on
page 558.
•
Differential Forms and Applications, by Manfredo P. do Carmo.
At only 118 pages, this slim volume (by a very well-respected student of Chern) packs
in a wealth of ideas and information, and some lovely exercises, some of which I have
appropriated here (with attribution!).
Forms (in Physics)
•
Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics (2nd edition), by V. I. Arnol’d.
A masterpiece by one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the twentieth century. Chapter
7 is a self-contained, elegant, and insightful introduction to Forms, which are then applied to
Hamiltonian mechanics.
•
Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity, by John Baez and Javier P. Muniain.
A wide-ranging, highly original, modern introduction to electromagnetism, gauge ﬁelds, and
gravity, most of which is expressed in the language of Forms. Amongst its many excellent

features is an insightful discussion of the role of Hodge duality in Maxwell’s Equations. Do
not overlook the Notes that conclude each of the three parts of the book: they contain anno-
tated recommendations for further study (very much like this section!), and they also contain
fascinating historical vignettes and pithy quotations. It is immensely refreshing and helpful
that the authors speak to the reader directly, in a friendly, informal way, as if addressing an
intelligent friend sitting right next to them, instead of proclaiming dry theorems into the void.
(Of course this is precisely what I have attempted to do in this book, too!)
•
Differential Forms and the Geometry of General Relativity, by Tevian Dray.
The only introduction to General Relativity to exclusively employ Forms as its mathematical
engine. Of the many features that recommend it, I would note that it includes a much more
complete discussion of Hodge duality than I have provided.
•
The Geometry of Physics (3rd edition), by Theodore Frankel.
An impressive tome that treats almost every topic covered by all of the books above, combined,
and has more beyond that! Forms are the primary language of the book. Of particular note,
however, is its unique treatment of the geometry of the Einstein tensor.
•
Curvature in Mathematics and Physics, by Shlomo Sternberg.
Forms are the primary language of this book. As the title suggests, it contains many interesting
applications to both mathematics and physics. In particular, it treats the following physical
topics in depth: Hodge duality and electromagnetism, explicit calculations of the geometry
and orbits of the Schwarzschild solution, and the geometry of the extremely important Kerr
solution (representing a spinning black hole), though he stops shy of actually computing the
curvature 2-forms. But this list hardly does justice to the wealth of material that is covered.
WARNING: the author describes the book as suitable for advanced undergraduates—it is not!
That said, if you have mastered my Act V, then you stand to learn a great deal from this book.
