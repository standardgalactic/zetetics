Linking epigenetic marks to clinical outcomes improves insight into molecular processes,
disease prediction, and therapeutic target identiﬁcation. Here, a statistical approach is pre-
sented to infer the epigenetic architecture of complex disease, determine the variation
captured by epigenetic effects, and estimate phenotype-epigenetic probe associations jointly.
Implicitly adjusting for probe correlations, data structure (cell-count or relatedness), and
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker effects, improves association estimates and in
9,448 individuals, 75.7% (95% CI 71.70–79.3) of body mass index (BMI) variation and
45.6% (95% CI 37.3–51.9) of cigarette consumption variation was captured by whole blood
methylation array data. Pathway-linked probes of blood cholesterol, lipid transport and sterol
metabolism for BMI, and xenobiotic stimuli response for smoking, showed >1.5 times larger
associations with >95% posterior inclusion probability. Prediction accuracy improved by
28.7% for BMI and 10.2% for smoking over a LASSO model, with age-, and tissue-speciﬁcity,
implying associations are a phenotypic consequence rather than causal.

D
ata characterizing gene expression, protein structure, or
epigenetic modiﬁcations such as DNA methylation, his-
tone marks and nucleosome positioning are becoming
increasingly available. Epigenetic marks reﬂect a wide range of
environmental exposures and genetic inﬂuences, are critical for
regulating gene and non-coding RNA expression1, and have been
shown to be associated with disease2. The identiﬁcation of
clinically relevant epigenetic loci can provide insight into the
molecular underpinning of disease3, leading to identiﬁcation of
biologically
relevant
therapeutic
targets4
and
potentially
epigenetic-guided clinical decision making5.
Most studies testing for association between genomic data and
complex traits utilize methodology from genome-wide associa-
tions studies, meaning that probe effects are tested one at a time6.
This methodology does not account for correlations among
probes and leads to model over-ﬁtting, poor effect size estimation,
and poor calibration of prediction owing to omitted variable
bias7. In addition, data structure such as intra-sample cellular
heterogeneity, sample relatedness, population stratiﬁcation, or
experimental design effects are a major challenge8 and result in
more cross-chromosome correlation than genetic data. This
structure, in conjunction with the fact that cases and controls
typically differ in their cell-type composition, can result in
spurious associations and many statistical algorithms have been
proposed to tackle these potential biases7,9,10. However, all cur-
rent statistical approaches rely upon corrections for structure that
require a choice of either a suitable reference proﬁle of repre-
sentative cell types, or a limited number of pre-selected variables
computed
from
the
methylation
data
(e.g.,
LFMM211
or
ReFACTor12), with the underlying assumption that all con-
founders are reﬂected by a sparse set of latent covariates and
methylation sites.
Here, we present an alternative approach, based on Bayesian
inference, that: (i) estimates probe effects on an outcome jointly
whilst adjusting for other covariates such as sex and age, avoiding
model over-ﬁtting and controlling for both data structure
(including cell-count effects) and correlations among probes; (ii)
does not require any knowledge of cell-type composition or any
selection of proxy confounder variables (i.e., accounts for both
known and unknown confounders); (iii) estimates the total pro-
portion of disease risk accounted for by the probe effects
(cumulative proportion of variance explained); (iv) estimates
probe effects conditional on other sources of data such as single-
nucleotide polymorphism data, enabling a determination of the
unique contribution of different data; (v) gives an in-depth
understanding of the genome-wide range of probe effects in terms
of the likely number of independent effects and their variance
explained; (vi) can incorporate genomic annotation information
into the analysis when estimating probe effects, facilitating unique
genome-wide
enrichment
analyses,
describing
the
variance
explained and number of trait-associated probes of each anno-
tation; and (vii) provides improved estimation of biomarker
effects, which could be used for disease risk assessment. The
approach is similar to, but more ﬂexible than linear mixed model
analyses recently proposed in genome-wide association studies13,
given that we can assign different prior distributions to different
sources of variance (individual covariates or groups of covariates).
We demonstrate properties (i) through (vii) with theory, simu-
lation and then empirical analysis of body mass index (BMI) and
smoking behavior for 9448 individuals with methylation probe
measures from whole blood14.
Results
Methods overview. Our approach assumes that the observed
phenotype y is reﬂected by a linear combination of genetic effects
(βG) estimated from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data,
epigenetic effects (βcpg) estimated from probes on an array, along
with age and sex speciﬁc effects (α, γ), such that:
y ¼ αage þ γsex þ Xcpgβcpg þ XGβG þ ϵ
ð1Þ
with the effects βG, βcpg, α, and γ being estimated in a Bayesian
statistical model. Unlike previous approaches that assign a mix-
ture of Gaussian distributions and a discrete spike at zero as a
prior for all effects, we assign a new set of mixtures to each group,
effectively augmenting the number of hyperparameters pro-
portionally to the number of groups of variables (two in the case
of SNPs and methylation probes). This allows for non-identiﬁable
effects to be excluded from the model, whereas the rest are esti-
mated jointly. Adjusting for all different covariates and their
effects while estimating each individual probe effect, better alle-
viates problems related to correlations and structure in the
marker data as we show in our simulation study (Fig. 1, also see
Methods). Distinguishing between groups of covariates helps us
better identify the variance attributable to each group, especially
in cases where average effects are bigger in one group (as is likely
for methylation and genetic markers). This is because each probe
estimate is made after adjusting for the SNP markers and the
other “omics” probes in the model. Therefore, our model cap-
tures, and thus accounts for, genetic relationships in the data15
and importantly for “omics” data, the model also automatically
accounts and controls for structural effects (such as cell-count
effects, experimental batch effects, or population structure),
negating the need to add additional controls for cell counts or
principal components within the model.
Our software implementation of this modeling framework,
(BayesRR, which is freely available, see “Code availability”) is
entirely ﬂexible. Unlike existing methods, any number of data
sources can be modeled together, each with separate mixtures,
making it applicable to any kind of genetic or epigenetic data.
Owing to efﬁcient computational implementation (see Methods),
it is also entirely scalable to future data sizes. Furthermore, if only
epigenetic probe data are available, estimates of the probe effects
would still be obtained jointly, avoiding model over-ﬁtting and
controlling for both data structure (including cell-count effects)
and correlations among probes (Fig. 1, also see Methods). In
addition, other major covariates could be included, for example,
including genetic loci of large effect such as HLA in immuno-
disease or APOE4 variant in Alzheimer disease, or latent factors
can still be ﬁt alongside alongside the probe data. We provide an
example of how the model can be simply extended to allow probe
effects to be estimated accounting for genomic annotation
information, providing estimates of genomic enrichment that
do not reply on post hoc testing. This ﬂexibility is important as
data sets will likely be variable in their structure and the degree to
which different “omics” measures are correlated.
Simulation study. We simulated methylation data for 2000
individuals at 103,638 probes with ﬁve different cell types. We
reproduced
cell-type
proportion
variation
present
in
real
methylation probe data, using a recently proposed simulation
model12. Our ﬁrst simulation scenario, was a sparse setting, where
a phenotype is determined by 100 differentially methylated
probes (see Methods), which cumulatively explained 60% of the
phenotypic variance in the trait. We focus in the main text on two
scenarios where probes are associated with cell-type proportion
variation and the norm of the correlation vector between the
phenotype and the cell-type proportions is either 0.08 or 0.25.
These scenarios reﬂect different degrees of confounding between
phenotype and cell-type proportions. We then conduct additional
simulations with a wide a range of settings, varying the cell-type

proportions, the proportions of differentially methylated probes,
the variance of differentially methylated probes, and the variance
of the measurement noise and we present these within the Sup-
plementary Information (Figs. 1–4 and see Methods).
We benchmarked our BayesRR approach against four recently
proposed methods: single-probe least squares regression, which
estimates probe associations one-by-one whilst correcting for
sparse latent factors to control for cell proportion confounding
(ReFACTor12), single-probe mixed linear model association test
that estimates probe associations one-by-one conditional on a
relationship matrix estimated from the probe data (OSCA-
moa13), a multi-probe ridge regression that estimates all probe
associations jointly and conditionally on latent factors (LFMM2-
ridge11), and a multimarker LASSO model, which estimates all
probe associations jointly and conditionally on latent factors
(LFMM2-lasso11). Our BayesRR approach outperforms these
approaches as it estimates phenotype-probe associations more
accurately with higher correlation of the estimated effects with
the true simulated values and with lower mean square error
(MSE, Fig. 1a). This results in almost twice the number of

methylome-wide signiﬁcant discoveries at
>95% posterior
inclusion probability (IP) within this data, whilst controlling
for cell-type proportion confounding and maintaining a false
discovery rate of much <5% (Fig. 1a). BayesRR controls for cell
proportion confounding without a requirement for the addition
of latent factors within the model, as evidenced by: (i) the
accurate effect size estimates with reduced MSE; (ii) no inﬂation
of the norm of the correlation vector between a individual-level
predictor made from the probe effects and the cell-type
proportions, and (iii) no correlation between the ﬁrst principal
component of the probe data and the difference between the
estimated and true effect, despite signiﬁcant cell-type proportion
confounding within the simulated data (Fig. 1a).
This is further evidenced by comparing LASSO and ridge
regression with latent factors implemented in LFMM11, to LASSO
and ridge regression without latent factors as implemented in
glmnet16, where we ﬁnd that that ability to recover the true effects
is increased, phenotype-probe associations are better estimated,
and cell-type confounding is controlled by the models that do not
ﬁt latent factors (Fig. 1b). This is because there are probes in this
setting that both inﬂuence the phenotype and are associated with
cell-type proportions, and thus by removing variation associated
with leading latent factors of the data, capacity to detect these
probes and estimate their effects accurately is reduced. In this
setting, approaches that estimate phenotype-probe association
one-by-one such as ReFACTor and OSCA-moa, do not control
for correlations in probe effects across the genome, resulting in
increased MSE and erroneous correlations between probe effect
estimates and cell-type proportion confounding (Fig. 1a). Having
shown that multi-probe methods remove the necessity for latent
factor correction and that BayesRR performs better than other
multi-probe approaches (Fig. 1a, b), we then conduct our
remaining benchmarking of BayesRR against LASSO and ridge
regression without latent factor correction as implemented in
glmnet, ﬁnding the exact same increased performance of BayesRR
irrespective of the variance of the cell-type proportions, the
proportions of differentially methylated probes, the variance of
differentially
methylated
probes,
and
the
variance
of
the
measurement noise (see Supplementary Figs. 1–4).
BayesRR
also
provides
accurate
estimation
of
the
total
proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the probes,
represented by the panel σ2
cg in Fig. 1a across different scenarios.
With the exception of a mixed linear model as implemented in
restricted effects maximum likelihood within OSCA13 (OSCA-
moa), all other approaches only enable estimation of the
proportion of variance attributable probes identiﬁed as genome-
wide signiﬁcant and thus do not provide an estimate of the total
association between the phenotype and the probe data (Fig. 1a).
We examined whether methylation probe effects can be estimated
conditionally on the SNP marker effects to determine the unique
contribution of each type of marker. We simulated correlated
genetic and epigenetic effects, with 100 epigenetic effects drawn
from a normal distribution N ð0; 0:5=100Þ, and a combination of
100
genetic
effects
drawn
from
a
normal
distribution
N ð0; 0:2=100Þ and 900 smaller genetic effects drawn from
N ð0; 0:01=900Þ from a total of 103,638 simulated SNP markers.
We ﬁnd that BayesRR can better distinguish between the variance
explained by genetic markers and methylation probes, as compared
with LASSO or ridge regression implemented in glmnet, but with
higher variability in the error of estimates as compared with when
only estimating phenotypic variance associated with methylation
probe (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4).
We
then
compared
BayesRR
with
other
multi-probe
approaches that do not ﬁt latent factors within the model across
two levels of sparsity, the ﬁrst where a phenotype is inﬂuenced by
100 probes (Fig. 1a) and the second where a phenotype is
inﬂuenced by 1000 probes (Fig. 1d). Both the mixed linear model
and BayesRR provide unbiased estimates of the proportion of
phenotypic variance captured by the probes, with the error
variance of each approach dependent upon the underlying effect
size distribution (Fig. 1a, d). Again however, estimated effects
from the other multi-probe approaches showed reduced correla-
tion with the true effects and higher MSE as compared with
BayesRR, demonstrating that BayesRR will provide improved
performance in both sparse and non-sparse regimes (Fig. 1d).
Application to BMI and smoking. We then applied BayesRR to
two lifestyle factors, smoking and BMI, that are correlated with
numerous health outcomes across the lifecourse. Previous studies
have shown that smoking produces a strong alteration in
methylation levels, which are related to the etiology of smoking-
related disease17. BMI has also been associated with methylation
levels and adipose-related traits18. Here, we present results from a
converged set of four models for each trait, each model having
different starting values, applied to 9448 individuals of the Gen-
eration Scotland cohort.
For BMI, 75.7% (95% CI 71.70–79.3) of the phenotypic
variance was captured by methylation probes, with 39.5% (95%
CI 28.3–49.7) of this attributable to 509.3 (95% CI 348–663)
probes that each explain ~0.1% of the phenotypic variance (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The remaining phenotypic
variance captured by methylation probes, was attributable to 10
probes with 95% IP, which cumulatively explain 9.7% (95% CI
7.5–11.9) of the phenotypic variance of BMI (Fig. 2b). This

type proportions have two different values either 0.08 or 0.25. Row panels provide results for different metrics of performance: the correlation between
true effects and estimates (ρðβ; ^βÞ), the slope of a regression of the estimates on the true effects (β^ββ), the number of genome-wide signiﬁcant probes
identiﬁed (loci), the mean square error (MSE), the MSE of the genome-wide signiﬁcant probes (MSEsig), the false discovery rate (FDR), the norm of the
correlation vector between a individual-level predictor made from the probe effects and the cell-type proportions (jjρðR; ^gÞjj), the correlation between

suggests that most epigenetic probe effects for BMI are relatively
small, but larger than SNP marker effects, which cumulatively
capture an additional 15.8% (CI 11.2–20.5) of the phenotypic
variance (Fig. 2a). In total, the variance captured by both
methylation probes and SNP markers was estimated as 91.5%
(95% CI 87.3–95). For smoking behavior, deﬁned as the number
of pack years, we ﬁnd that 45.6% (95% CI 37.3–51.9) of
phenotypic variance is captured by methylation probes (Fig. 2). In
contrast to BMI, we ﬁnd evidence for 17 probes with 95% IP,
which capture (26.7%, 95% CI 22.3–30.9) the variance explained
by methylation probes (Fig. 2). We observe that 35.15% (95% CI
24–46) of phenotypic variance was attributable to 111.34 (95% CI
87–140) methylation probes of effect size <1%, whereas there are
3.42 (95% CI 0–9) probes with effect size <10% explaining 5.5%
(95% CI 0–14.27) of the variance (Fig. 2). Of the probes mapped
to genes, 6.43% (95% CI 4.91–7.95) are in the model for BMI,
>0.2% (95% CI 0.15–0.24) for smoking behavior (Fig. 2). In total,
the variance captured by both methylation probes and SNP
markers was estimated as 51.5% (95% CI 42.1–58.8). Taken
together, these results highlight the ability of our approach to
describe the architecture of epigenetic associations, in terms of
the likely number and effect size of associated probes, and our
results imply a large effective number of epigenetic probe
associations, spread throughout the genome, for BMI as opposed
to a limited number for smoking behavior.
We performed our analysis both with and without adjustment
for the ﬁrst 20 principal components of the genetic data, the ﬁrst 20
principal components of the methylation levels and the cell
composition, ﬁnding practically identical estimates with and
without these adjustments (see Methods). We repeated the analysis
but excluded close relatives and modeled only the methylation
probe effects in 2,614 unrelated individuals, ﬁnding 69.55% (95%
CI 57.35–78.32) of the phenotypic variance for BMI and 73.83%
(95% CI 54.33–88.26) for smoking, respectively. We also used a
linear mixed effects model where probe values are used to calculate
a co-variance matrix, which is then used in a restricted maximum
likelihood estimation (REML) approach13, but this approach did
not produce a converged set of estimates for either phenotype, with
or without relatives in this data. These results imply that our
estimates of the variance captured by methylation probes, are
independent
of the
variance
attributable
to SNP markers,
independent of family effects, and independent of data structure
captured by the leading principal components of the data.
We then proceeded to derive annotation information from the
posterior distribution over effects to provide some biological
inference. First, we looked for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
for the probes whose IP was >95% (see Methods). From the 20
top-enriched terms, we ﬁnd those corresponding to thrombin-
related pathways and cerebral cortex development for smoking
(Supplementary Table 6). From the 20 top-enriched terms, we
ﬁnd those related to ESCRT-II complex, glycoprotein transport,
and cholesterol for BMI (Supplementary Table 7).
We looked for the probes with 95% IP, shown in Fig. 3a, b, in
the EWAS catalog. We count the appearance of traits in previous

associations for each of these probes with 95% IP, the resulting
histograms are shown in Fig. 3c, d. We also found associations
with triglycerides, cholesterol, and smoking for the probes found
in the BMI trait. We found previous associations with Alcohol
consumption and educational attainment for the probes found in
the smoking trait. From the probes with 95% IP in BMI, all had
been previously associated with BMI in the EWAS catalog, for
smoking, three probes with 95% IP had not been previously
associated with smoking-related traits in the EWAS catalog, these
probes are cg00884093, cg0440053, and cg23288337. We further
looked in genes associated with these probes, we found gene
CELSR1 for which has been associated to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease disk among women19; the other gene, ETV5 is
member of the oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors20;
the ﬁnal gene, ECEL1P2 has been associated with differential
methylation levels in smokers even after quitting and lung
cancer risk21,22. Thus, probes with 95% IP show congruent
with previous results along with suggesting two genes whose
DNA methylation levels are not directly related to smoking in
literature.
We performed a comparison of the magnitude and sign over all
mean effect sizes estimated in this study and those in the EWAS
catalog over different tissues. The resulting plots Fig. 3e for BMI
and Fig. 3f for smoking show in the upper panel the logarithm
base 10 of our mean effect estimates as black crosses, with blue
points representing previous effect sizes with the same sign as our
estimates, and with shape corresponding to the tissue these effects
were calculated for, red points indicate that the previous estimate
had the opposite sign than our estimates. On the lower panel of
both subﬁgures we observe the PIP of the corresponding probe in

the upper panel, we observe how the congruency between our
estimates and the EWAS catalog estimates diminishes as the PIP
reduces. For our model, the reduction of power to identify the
effect is reﬂected. However, without regularization we run the risk
of systematically over-estimating the effect sizes if non-signiﬁcant
effect sizes are unreported, as seems to be the case here. By
regularizing, we are better equipped to resolve the estimates in
these low power regimes, yielding improved estimation and more
efﬁcient use of the data.
We further take advantage of the fact that if we use the
posterior distribution over all effects, we can derive a posterior
distribution over GO terms and devise a deﬁnition of enrichment
(see Methods). Under our enrichment statistic, we can measure
those
GO
terms,
which
explain
a
greater
proportion
of
phenotypic variance than expected, given the proportion of
probes that map to the GO term (Supplementary Fig. 17 for BMI,
Supplementary Fig. 18 for smoking). Then, using a ROPE
decision rule23, we can deﬁne a term as being enriched if the IP of
the GO term in the model is >95%, and if 95% of the posterior
distribution of enrichment is outside the interval 0:5; 1:5
ð
Þ. We
sorted signiﬁcantly enriched terms by their mean enrichment and
generated a tree map of the terms using REVIGO24. For BMI,
there is a preponderance of lipid transport, cholesterol transport,
morphogenesis, and above all, regulation of epidermal growth
factor-activated receptor activity (Supplementary Fig. 15). For
smoking, response to xenobiotic stimulus was enriched (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16). Taken together, this demonstrates the novel
ﬁndings and additional inference that can be obtained from
conducting whole-genome enrichment analyses, rather than
testing for enrichment at only those effects that are singularly
found to be above a signiﬁcance threshold.
Third, we took this one-step further by extending our model to
group probes according to prior biological information and then
estimate the probe effects incorporating genomic annotation. We
based our annotations on results by25 that computed t scores for
the speciﬁcity of gene expression in every tissue from GTEx
consortium26. We considered that a gene was differentially
expressed (positively or negatively) speciﬁcally to a given tissue if
the absolute value of its t score for that tissue was in the 0.001 or
0.999 quantiles of the t distribution. We then mapped the probes
to genes and genes to tissues, probes that did not mapped to a
gene in the GTEx data were put in a different group. In order to
achieve non overlapping associations of probes to tissues (as
required for our model), we assigned each gene to the tissue they
were the most speciﬁc to (i.e., the tissue that had the highest
absolute t score for that gene). The probes were therefore put in
46 different groups (one for each tissue available in GTEx) when
feasible. Some tissues had too few probes associated to them, we
therefore lumped them together in group 47 (others) so that every
group contained at least 200 probes. Probes that were mapped to
genes that do not appear in the array were put in group 48, age
and sex were assigned to group 49, and SNPs to group 50. Each
one of these groups were assigned the prior mixture variances of
(0.0001, 0.001, 0.01). We estimated the variance attributable to
each group of probes and further decomposed these estimates by
the mixture they belonged (Fig. 4). For both traits, methylation
probes of genes differentially expressed in whole blood showed
highest variance explained which is expected given the tissue used
to generate the methylation data (Fig. 4). Conditional on this, our
model partitions the variation attributable to other annotation
groups, and across mixture groups within each annotation. For
BMI, methylation of genes that are differentially expressed in the
adrenal gland, subcutaneous adipose, thyroid, ﬁbroblasts also
showed larger effect sizes (Fig. 4). For smoking, we ﬁnd that
probes mapping to genes that are differentially expressed in the
aorta, the tibial artery, the brain spinal cord, and lymphocytes are
also those with larger probe effects (Fig. 4). Associations for BMI
are spread among tissues and among mixtures more so than for
smoking (Fig. 4), highlighting the large effective number of BMI
associations in blood spread across biological processes.
Finally, we use the estimated methylation probe effects to
predict BMI and smoking behavior in the Lothian Birth Cohort
1936 (LBC), the Accessible Resource of Integrated Epigenomics
Studies (ARIES) data set and the UK Adult Twin (TwinsUK)
Registry (see Methods). We compared the prediction accuracy
gained from our approach to recently obtained estimates from
another model based on the LASSO estimator, using the R2
metric. For BMI, we achieve an adjusted R2 of 19.5% with a slope
of 0.72 (0.052 SE) for adult BMI in LBC and 30.83% with a slope
of 0.86 (0.041 SE) in TwinsUK (Table 1), reﬂecting the fact that
the age structure of TwinsUK more closely reﬂects that of GS, then
the elderly individuals of LBC. In the ARIES data set, we achieve
R2 of 3.34% with a slope of 0.38 (0.061 SE) for birth weight, 2.05%
with slope of 0.3 (0.069 SE) for BMI at age 7, 9.65% with a slope of
0.6 (0.071 SE) for BMI age 15 and up, 24.43% with a slope of 0.84
(0.069 SE) for BMI in adult males, and 18.36% with a slope of 0.7
(0.069 SE) for BMI in adult females (Table 1). Differences in slope
(and prediction accuracy) imply differences in the methylation
associations across ages and cohorts for BMI, suggesting that
methylation associations are a consequence of BMI and are to
some degree speciﬁc to the lifestyle/diet of individuals at a
particular time and place. Overall, these values amount to an
improvement of 28.7% in comparison to the LASSO predictor in
the LBC. For smoking, we observed an adjusted R2 of 47.9% with
slope of 1.02 (0.058 SE) for LBC and 38.49% with slope of 1.01
(0.057 SE) for males in ARIES, 13.7% more than the LASSO
predictor (Table 1). This replicates previous results showing that
methylation proﬁles predict BMI independently of genetic proﬁles
in an additive manner27 and shows that our approach can better
capture the overall distribution of effects, including small effects,
whereas accurately estimating larger effects, leading to improved
phenotypic prediction.
We further assessed the variation captured by our predictors in
adipose tissue within the TwinsUK data, ﬁnding 9.33% R2 with a
slope of 0.4 (0.065 SE, Table 1), implying that methylation
associations in whole blood and adipose tissue overlap, but with a
degree of tissue-speciﬁcity. We also assessed the variation
captured by our predictors in other traits ﬁnding in LBC wave
one that our smoking predictor captures 7.2% of the variance for
forced expiratory volume, and our BMI predictor captures 11.2%
of the variance of triglyceride levels in blood and 7.6% of the
variance of high density lipoprotein levels in blood. These results,
along with our enrichment analyses, show that our approach
captures a signal related to the relevant biological processes
underlying these phenotypes, but that trait-methylation associa-
tions show age- and tissue-speciﬁcity.
It is important to note that the sample size and variance
captured by all of the probe effects in the training data govern the
prediction accuracy obtaining in the testing data. Following28, the
squared correlation between a phenotype in an independent
sample and a predictor of the phenotype can be approximated
given the sample size of the initial study, the expected variance
explained by the covariates, and the effective number of
independent
covariates.
Assuming
an
effective
number
of
covariates of 20,000 (approximate number of protein coding
genes) an R2 of ~25% is expected for BMI within our prediction
samples, which is in-line with the values we obtain here. If the
initial study sample size increased to 100,000 individuals than an
R2 of over 60% is expected, which in combination with SNP array
data, would lead to a predictor of BMI with an R2 of ~80% from a
single blood test. However, the theory described above does not
account for the fact that probe variation is likely a consequence of

the phenotype and thus in a regression equation, phenotypic
variance will appear on both sides. If the consequential effects are
large and there are considerable changes with age that occur29, or
differences in effects across tissues, then the prediction accuracy
obtained from methylation probe data will likely differ across
cohorts as demonstrated here.
Discussion
We present BayesRR, a statistical model for joint inference of
genetic and epigenetic effects over complex phenotypic traits. Using
simulation, we show that BayesRR outperforms other approaches as
it has the advantage of controlling for all factors at once and per-
forming statistical inference jointly on all of the model parameters

and adjusting estimates conditionally on each other. By working in
a Bayesian framework, we derive a rich representation of the esti-
mated effects through probability distributions, where all markers
are taken into account and for which we can assess genome-wide
enrichment of relevant biological features. From these distributions,
we conclude that from the same set of probes in the same indivi-
duals, two example phenotypes show different architecture in the
distribution of their effects, with the distribution of effects for
cigarette consumption being more concentrated in a few epigenetic
markers (15 markers with 95% IP explaining ~26.78%), whereas for
BMI, we have more probes associated with the phenotype (17
markers with 95% IP explain only 9.70%). Our genome-wide
enrichment analyses, identiﬁed blood cholesterol, lipid transport,
and sterol metabolism pathways for BMI, and response to xeno-
biotic stimulus for smoking, all with >95% posterior IP of having
methylation probes with effects sizes
>1.5 times larger than the
average. For both BMI and cigarette consumption, a large amount
of phenotypic variance is captured by epigenetic markers in the
training data set, which may be expected as trait-associated DNA
methylation probe variation is likely to a large degree to be a
consequence of the phenotype, as evidenced in our enrichment
analyses and the prediction results from the ARIES study. These
consequential effects lead to the expectation that if applied to
common complex disease, the model we present may enable
accurate characterization of disease progression and better identi-
ﬁcation of individuals who are on a path to disease where future
diagnosis is likely (i.e., those that are pre-diabetic, in the early stages
of dementia, etc.). It remains to be seen whether such large amounts
of phenotypic variance can be captured by a methylation array for
common complex disease, but our prediction results shows that our
approach can better describe the overall distribution of associations
leading to improved phenotypic prediction.
There are a number of important considerations and caveats. It
is important to punctuate that the inferred associations only relate
to the present state of the biomarkers and are not intended to
capture any causality between methylation status and outcome.
Given the highly variable nature of “omics” measures, the varia-
tion across data sets in the degree of confounding by experimental
biases or unwanted biological variation that will contribute to the
variation captured by probes, and the considerable changes with
age that occur29, it is highly unlikely that the phenotypic variance
attributable to probes is stable across cohorts and with age.
Determining biomarkers for future disease outcomes requires a
different experimental design, for example, longitudinal studies
with a baseline, along with methodological extensions for causal
inference within this framework, which our future work will focus
on. In addition, while we extend the model to ask how much
additional phenotypic variance of each trait can be captured by
methylation probes from whole blood above that captured by a
SNP array, partitioning the phenotypic variance explained exactly
may be difﬁcult in data sets where factors are highly correlated.
Furthermore, although we present a whole-genome enrichment
approach, identifying novel pathways is currently limited and
technological improvements are required to improve our ability to
capture, deﬁne, and understand epigenetic marker variation.
Finally, Bayesian inference comes at increased computational cost
and requires the speciﬁcation of prior distributions, for example
here, that effects can be well described by a series of Gaussian
distributions. A Student-t likelihood could be a path worth
exploring as its inferences could be more robust to outliers30 and
additionally, although a Gaussian model may still be applied to
categorical disease-or-not measurements, developing an extension
to model binary response variables and explore performance in
unbalanced case–control settings will likely be worthwhile.
In conclusion, our model can be applied to any kind of genomics
data providing unbiased estimates of marker effects, conditional on
other markers, covariates and on the data structure, without the
need for speciﬁc cell-type proportion control. By operating in a
Bayesian framework, the uncertainties over the estimates given the
data are represented explicitly, helping the researcher to interpret
and draw conclusions over the architecture of the variance in the
trait. We provide freely available software with source code available
to facilitate further replication and potential applications of the
methodology (see “Code Availability”).

sample (μ, β, ϵ, σϵ, θ) is stored in a synchronized queue for a consumer thread to store in

the order of the effects to be sampled.

Simulation study of methylation data. We use a generative model of methylation
levels as in ref. 12, where the matrix O 2 RN ´ M represents the methylation levels
for M probes in N individuals. This matrix can be decomposed in a matrix of K cell
proportions for N individuals, which we denote R 2 RN ´ K, and a matrix of cell-
speciﬁc methylation levels S 2 RK ´ M. The decomposition assumes i.i.d. observa-
tion noise such that

For these simulations we relied on software kindly provided by the authors12.
We performed a slight modiﬁcation to be able to change the variance of the cell
proportions matrix P. For each simulation we generated a matrix of N = 2000 and
M = 103,638. The simulation parameters were in accordance to12:
●
Proportion of differentially methylated probes (p).
●
Variance of the DMPs(τ).
●
Variance of the cell proportions (sp).
●

f
g, for this case the
simulated model consists of effects over the noisy methylation matrix Oy =
OB + ϵ.
which amounts to 255 simulated data sets in total.
For each of the 270 simulations, we ran our method for the observed phenotype
y centered and scaled to variance 1, the observed methylation matrix O as inputs
and with mixture variances (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001), for 20,000 samples with
10,000 samples of burn-in after which a thinning of 10 samples was used to select
samples of the posterior for the simulation. We selected trait-associated probes as
those that were in the model in >95% of the posterior samples, which we deﬁne as
95% posterior IP.
We used the following metrics to assess model performance: the correlation
between true effects and estimates (ρðβ; ^βÞ), the slope of a regression of the
estimates on the true effects (β^ββ), the number of genome-wide signiﬁcant probes
identiﬁed (loci), the MSE, the MSE of the genome-wide signiﬁcant probes (MSEsig),
the false discovery rate (FDR), the norm of the correlation vector between a
individual-level predictor made from the probe effects and the cell-type
proportions (jjρðR; ^gÞjj), the correlation between the ﬁrst principal component of
the probe data and the difference between the estimated and true effect (∣∣ρ(P, R)∣∣)
and the phenotypic variance attributable to the probes (σ2
cg). These statistics were
obtained for the simulations and shown in Supplementary Figs. 1–3.
Competing methods. For comparisons with our method we chose the common
EWAS methodology, which is derived from the GWAS methodology. For each
simulation replicate we ran the following models:
Single-probe least squares regression (GWAS): We conducted a set of 103,638
linear regressions using the function lm() from R version 3.4.2, and accepted the
effect sizes whose p value (t test) was <0.05/103638 (Bonferroni correction).
Single-probe least squares regression with sparse latent factors (ReFACTor):
Using the approach outlined in ref. 12, we selected ﬁve sparse components (one for
each cell type in the simulation) and estimated probe associations conditional upon
these one-by-one. We selected associated probes whose p value (t test) was less than
0.05/103638.
Single-probe mixed linear model association analysis (OSCA): Using the
approach outlined in13, we used a linear mixed effects model where probe values
are used to calculate a co-variance matrix, which is then used in a REML approach
to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to the probes, and
conditional upon this probe effects are estimated one-by-one. Although this
estimates probe associations conditional on the co-variance matrix, it does not
account for genome-wide co-variance across probes. We selected associated probes
whose p value (t test) was <0.05/103,638.
Multi-probe penalized regression with latent factors (LFMM): Using the
approach outlined in ref. 11, we ran LASSO and ridge regression with 10-fold cross-
validation using the default settings (with ﬁve latent factors, one for each cell type
in the simulation), whereas also ﬁtting latent factors within the model that are
intended to control for cell-type proportion confounding. We used the
lfmm_function and selected probes based on the calibrated p value (t test) whose p
value (t test) was <0.05/103,638.
Multi-probe penalized regression without latent factors (glmnet): We ran LASSO
and ridge regression with 10-fold cross-validation using the default settings of
package glmnet16 version 2.0-16. Previous experiments suggested that best
performance was achieved by leaving the phenotype vector y un-scaled.
Simulations of genotype and methylation effects. We simulated a methylation
matrix M with parameters p = 0.15, τ = 0.07, sp = 1000, ϑ = 0.01 as above, with the
same number of SNPS as the methylation matrix (103,638). Then, we generated a
genotype matrix X 2 R1000 ´ 103638. For each of the DMPS with non-zero effects in
M we select column j of X to have a correlated genotype by sampling its elements
from the distribution:
Xij  Binomial
2;
1
1 þ expð10  c  MijÞ
 
!
ð25Þ
by sampling c from an uniform distribution between 20 and 25 for each column,
we achieve a pairwise genotype-methylation correlation between 0 and 0.6 for a
genotype column and a corresponding column of methylation proﬁles (for those
methylation probes with non-zero effects).
Having both matrices O (the noisy observations over matrix M) and X centered
and scaled, we generated 100 methylation effects βcg  N 0; 0:5

Thus, the model for the simulated genotype is y Oβcg + Xβg + ϵ, with

We repeated the process 15 times to have 15 simulated data sets. For each of the
simulated data sets we ran our method for 200,00 samples, with a burn-in of 100,00
and a thinning of 10 samples. The mixture variances were set to (0.1, 0.01, 0.001,
0.0001) for methylation effects and to (0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001) for genotype
effects. We compared out approach with LASSO and Ridge regression implemented
in glmnet16, with a baseline of single marker regression (GWAS) where we ﬁrst
adjusted the phenotype by the ﬁrst 10 principal components of the genotype matrix
and then regressed the residuals against the scaled methylation matrix. The methods
were compared over the estimation of the true genetic and epigenetic VE and ability
to estimate the true effects. Results shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.
Generation Scotland. Generation Scotland: the Scottish Family Health Study is a
large population-based, family-structured cohort of over 24,000 individuals aged
18–99 years. The study baseline took place between 2006 and 2011 and included
detailed cognitive, physical, and health questionnaires, along with sample donation
for genetic and biomarker data. DNA methylation data from whole blood was
obtained on a subset of ~10,000 participants. The Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC
Bead Chips array was used to measure methylation and quality control details have
been reported previously29. In brieﬂy, outliers based on the visual inspection of
methylated to unmethylated log intensities were excluded, along with poorly per-
forming probes and samples, and sex mismatches (predicted based on genetics versus
questionnaire data) yielding an analysis data set of 9448. As reported in McCartney
et al.29, further ﬁltering was performed to exclude non-autosomal CpG sites and sites
that were exclusive to the EPIC array. This allowed for the predictors to be applied to
data sets that collected DNA methylation using an earlier version of the Illumina
arrays (450 k array) giving a total of 370,262 probes.
After the quality control steps described above, we integrated the SNP marker
and methylation matrices, along with the log-transformed age and the sex of the
individuals (encoded as 1 for Female). All matrices and phenotypes were centered
and scaled to variance 1. The data were used as input for our Bayesian model, with
parameters (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01) for genetic effects mixtures variances and (0.01, 0.1,
1) for the epigenetic effects, age, and sex. Four chains for each trait with different
starting values were executed. We assessed the convergence of the hyperparameters
σ2
ϵ; σ2
G; σ2
ϕ through the Geweke test35 and the ^R criteria36, with the help of the R
package ggmcmc37, see Supplementary Figs. 5–14. As result, the algorithm yielded a
set of samples over the posterior distribution of effects conditioned on the observed
phenotype, the genetic and epigenetic probes and controlled by age and sex. We
further scaled in each sample the hyperparameters σ2
ϵ; σ2
G, and σ2
ϕ by dividing each
one by their sum (σ2
ϵ þ σ2
G þ σ2
ϕ). The posterior distribution is summarized in
Supplementary Table 1 for BMI and Supplementary Table 2 for smoking. IP were
computed by counting the times a probe is present in the model (in any of the
mixtures) and divided by the total number of posterior samples. We performed the
same procedure but adding the ﬁrst 20 PCs of the DNA methylation matrix, the ﬁrst
20 PCs of the genotype matrix along with the cell composition of the samples as
extra 46 covariates. We regressed the mean of the posterior effect sizes of the model
without these covariates against the model with these covariates. The mean effect
sizes are practically identical for BMI and smoking, with an R2 of 0.97 slope of 0.99
for BMI and R2 of 0.99 slope of 1 for smoking.
We then contrasted the variance explained by the ﬁrst ﬁve PCs of the probes
with 95% PIP in BMI and smoking, to predict their respective phenotypes. We
found that these ﬁrst ﬁve PCs in BMI probes do not have predictive power for BMI,
thus, this suggests that the main axis of variation of these probes with 95% PIP do
not explain as much of the phenotype as the whole set of probes with 95% PIP for

BMI. For smoking the ﬁve PCs derived from the probes with 95% PIP for the same
phenotype explain ~44% of the variance. We further veriﬁed that the predictive
power of the 46 covariates (genetic and methylation PCs, along with cell-count
effects) explain 7% variance in BMI and 10% variance in smoking. We observed
that the ﬁrst PC for the probes with 95% PIP for BMI is highly correlated with cell
counts (Supplementary Fig. 19), the fact that these PCs do not explain much
variance in BMI suggests that these correlations are not meaningful for predicting
the phenotype. For smoking, it is clear that the PCs of the probes with 95% PIP and
the cell counts are weakly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 20), thus the predictive
power for these PCs seems to be not aligned to cell-counts effects. These analyses
suggest that for BMI the probes with 95% PIP do not explain together as much
variance as the analogous probes for smoking, that the variance explained by the
probes with 95% PIP is almost the same as the variance explained by their PCs and
that in both cases, their predictive power seems to be independent to their
correlation with cell counts.
These results, stability of estimates even after adjusting for confounders, and
predictive power independent to cell counts, support our conclusions that the
learned model’s effect carry information over the traits of interest.
Enrichment analysis. Probes were associated to their respective gene ENTREZ
identiﬁers using the R packages IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.
hg1938 and biomaRT39. We provide a list of each gene with IP >5% for BMI
Supplementary Table 4, and for smoking Supplementary Table 5.
Then, we associated the mapped genes with their respective terms in the Gene
Onthology (GO) using the R package40. With these probe-terms associations we
computed enrichment as deﬁned by:
enrichment ¼ p:PVE
p:Term
ð26Þ
with p. PVE being the proportion of variance explained by probes associated with
the term, having βTerm being the effects associated with the term and being βModel
the effects in the model (that is, those which are not coming from the spike at zero)
in the current sample, we have
p:PVE ¼
PTermβ2
Term
PModelβ2
Model
ð27Þ
and p.Term being the proportion of probes mapping to the term among all the
probes mapping to a term in the current sample. Having #probesTerm being the
number of probes mapping to a term and #probesModel the number of probes in the
model in the current sample, we have
p:Term ¼ #probesTerm
#probesModel
ð28Þ
We also computed the IP for a term by counting the times a term appears in the
model and dividing by the number of samples. Finally, given that we have a
posterior distribution over enrichment values, we adopt the ROPE decision rule23,
for which, we accept the hypothesis that a term is signiﬁcantly over/under-enriched
if 95% of the posterior mass for the enrichment value is outside the interval (0.5,
1.5) and the term has an IP >95%. Signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms are presented
in the Supplementary Information.
Estimates for replication. For both BMI and smoking, the posterior samples over
effects where averaged and associated to their respective probe and SNP identities.
For each replication cohort, a predictor was built by multiplying the posterior mean
effects by the corresponding centered and scaled genetic and epigenetic marker
readings, and predictive ability measured over the scaled and centered cohort trait
was measured using the R2 statistic.
Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 is a longitudinal study
of aging41. It follows 1091 members of the 1947 Scottish Mental Survey, who were
recontacted in later life, when they were living in the Edinburgh area of Scotland.
The cohort members were all born in 1936 and have been assessed for a wide
variety of health and lifestyle outcomes at ages 70, 73, 76, 79, and 82 years. DNA
has been collected at each clinical visit. In the present study, we considered DNA
methylation data (Illumina 450 k array) from whole blood, taken at mean age 70,
for analysis. Details of the collection and processing of the data have been reported
previously29. In brief, after quality control to remove poorly performing methy-
lation sites, samples, and individuals with mismatching genotypes or predicted sex,
a sample of 906 individuals was available for prediction analysis. The genotype and
methylation matrices were processed as with GS, given that the posterior effect
sizes for age and sex were equal to zero for both traits, they were not included.
The UK adult twin Registry. The TwinsUK registry consists of over 14,000 research
volunteer twin participants from the United Kingdom who have joined since 1992,
with equal numbers of same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs who are
predominately female (84%). Data are collected through longitudinal questionnaires
and clinical visits. The registry collects biological samples and further data collected
through analysis of biological samples. DNA methylation proﬁles were generated
using the Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in adipose tissue biopsies and
whole-blood samples from TwinsUK participants. Adipose tissue DNA methylation
data were generated from subjects who were free from severe diseases, as previously
described42. Whole-blood DNA methylation proﬁles have previously been descri-
bed43. Additional data processing steps for this project included use of ENmix44 for
quality control and minﬁ45 to exclude samples with median methylated and unme-
thylated signals below 10.5. After data-quality control, covariate assessments, and
sample processing, downstream analyses were carried out in 540 adipose (mean age
59, age range 28–85, 100% female) and 977 whole blood (mean age 58, age range
19–82, 97% female) TwinsUK samples. Ethical approval was granted by the National
Research Ethics Service London-Westminster, the St Thomas’ Hospital Research
Ethics Committee (EC04/015 and 07/H0802/84). All research participants provided
written informed consent prior to taking part in the study.
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples were drawn from the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children46,47. Blood from 1018
mother–child pairs (children at three time points and their mothers at two time
points) were selected for analysis as part of the Accessible Resource for Integrative
Epigenomic Studies (ARIES, http://www.ariesepigenomics.org.uk/)48. Following
DNA extraction, samples were bisulphite converted using the Zymo EZ DNA
Methylation kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA, USA). Following conversion, genome-wide
methylation was measured using the Illumina Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450
(HM450) BeadChip. The arrays were scanned using an Illumina iScan, with initial
quality review using GenomeStudio. ARIES was preprocessed and normalized
using the mefﬁl R package49. ARIES consists of 5469 DNA methylation proﬁles
obtained from 1022 mother–child pairs measured at ﬁve time points (three time
points for children: birth, childhood, and adolescence; and two for mothers: during
pregnancy and at middle age). Low-quality proﬁles were removed from further
processing, and the remaining 4593 proﬁles were normalized using the Functional
Normalization algorithm50 with the top 10 control probe principal components.
Full details of the preprocessing and normalization of ARIES have been described
previously49.
