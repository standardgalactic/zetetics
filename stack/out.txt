NEW PHILOSOPHY OF ONTO-COSMOLOGY: SWIMMEAN PARADIGM 
SYNTHESIZING DAOIST METAPHYSICS AND BIG-BANG PHYSICS 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
 
This dissertation formulates a Swimmean paradigm in the philosophy of 
onto-cosmology. The paradigm is set up by synthesizing the Daoist metaphysical 
philosophy and the modern big-bang cosmology. It describes that the known 
universe evolves in conformity with both a binary numeral system and a cyclic 
black-hole (BH) model. The system is extended from Shao Yong’s (邵雍 1012–
1077) world-ordering standards in interpreting the Yijing (I-Ching 易经). The 
model is set up by employing the relativistic Einstein-Friedmann equations. The 
formulation of the paradigm is based on the historical-critical and literary-critical 
methods of exegesis. The paradigm offers a three-tier, holofractal and holographic 
calendrical chronology of the universe driven by the 12 cosmogenetic powers in 
the Swimmean evolutionism. On the one side, it reinforces the Daoist Principle  
(li 理)–Vital Power (qi 气) cosmoecology (fengshui 风水). On the other side, it 
validates a BH universe, which is a bouncing horn-torus in an eon of 16.8 billion 
years between two quantum-gravity singularities in successive big-bangs.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
In 2016, I came to the California Institute of Integral Studies, inspired by 
Einstein's often quoted dictum: “Science without religion is lame, religion without 
science is blind” (Einstein, 1954, p. 46). In attending the PCC lectures toward a 
PhD degree in the philosophy, cosmology and consciousness program, I gained an 
impressive education from several professors including, but not limited to, Brian 
Thomas Swimme, Steven D. Goodman, Sean Kelly, Yi Wu, and others. 
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Professor Swimme, the supervisor. I 
appreciate his broad knowledge in philosophy of cosmology, and the critical 
reactions, brainstorming ideas, and valuable suggestions. I particularly thank 
Professor Goodman, the expert in Asian Philosophies and Cultures, and professor 
J. F. Marc des Jardins, a Canadian Sinologist from Concordia University, 
Montreal. As the two members of the Ph.D. committee, they offered timely advice 
in the phase of the project proposal and thesis completion.  
An exceptional appreciation goes out to the Avatamsaka Buddhist Lotus 
Society (ABLS), Milpitas, CA, and the City of Ten-Thousand Buddhas, Ukiah, 
CA. They provided financial and library helps. At ABLS, Ven. Master Tian-
Cheng is an expert on the Avataṃsaka Sūtra. I also thank Dr. Cuiwei Yang, 
Concordia University, for the discussions in the formation and development of the 
neo-Confucianism and in the contributions of missionaries to Sino-West 
exchanges.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
Onto-cosmology consists of an ontological principle and a cosmological 
basis of reality. On the one hand, cosmology deals with the origin and evolution 
of existence (Smeenk & Ellis, 2017) by making use of "the data of direct 
experience and the conclusions established by the analysis of these data" (Coffey, 
1918, p. 19) to explore the evolution, nature, and destiny of the universe. On the 
other hand, ontology studies the physical principles or the principle of reality 
(Andina, 2014, p. 14). It concerns  
with the objects of knowledge, with reality considered in the widest, most 
profound, and most fundamental aspects, under which the human mind 
conceives it; with the being and becoming of reality, its possibility and its 
actuality, its essence and its existence, its unity and plurality; with the 
aspects of truth, goodness, perfection, beauty, which it assumes in relation 
with our minds; with the contingency of finite reality and the grounds and 
implications both of its actual existence and of its intelligibility; with the 
modes of its concrete existence and behavior, the supreme categories of 
reality as they are called: substance, individual nature, and personality; 
quantity, space and time, quality and relation, causality and purpose. 
(Coffey, 1918, p. 23) 
Onto-cosmology provides a unitary wholeness of ontological and 
cosmological philosophy. It is concerned with the law of a cosmic universalism. 
That is, all the entities of reality are interdependent and interconnected. The 
continued development of civilization in human history has laid a solid 
foundation for the formation of a modern paradigm of onto-cosmology by 
incorporating Daoist metaphysical ideology and modern big-bang physics. 
Statement of the Problem 
Current philosophical and scientific understanding of reality emerges after 
Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity in 1915. It has stepped into an 
observation-supported stage since the 1960s. Significant achievements were made

in the last half-century, including the theory of big-bang cosmology. It 
successfully explained the fundamental observations under the assumption of an 
expanding Universe, homogeneous, and isotropic on sufficiently larger scales of 
more than 250 million light-years (Pettinari, 2016, pp. 9 & 37).  
Recently, the full-emission Planck observations presented the most 
significant results (Planck Collaboration, 2016). One of them gave the age of the 
observable universe, 13.799±0.021 Ga. However, the observed universe is merely 
one causal patch of a much larger unobservable reality. Thus, there are unknown 
spheres which are outside the current cosmological horizon and unable to be 
observed. Even for the observed body itself, there are essential observational and 
theoretical questions left. They include, for example, the existence and the 
property of the singularity; the validity of the homogeneity and the observed 
expansion; the possibility of the primordial cosmic inflation and the induced 
density fluctuations; the holographic properties of the universe; and, the 
multiverse in which the world resides (Pettinari, 2016, pp. 37–38).  
Before the mid-20th century, modern cosmology had a strikingly 
philosophical tone (Smeenk, 2013, pp. 607–652). Similar to that era, the 21st 
century has witnessed rapid growth in the philosophy of physics and cosmology. 
It leaves room for philosophers who contemplate on the physical laws of Nature, 
investigate the cosmic features of the unknown multiverse, and predict new trends 
for the philosophy of cosmology and consciousness.

Research Objectives 
This dissertation aims at bringing modern philosophical and scientific 
understandings of reality into dialogue with ancient metaphysics on the topics of 
onto-cosmology. This approach will be thoroughly interdisciplinary. The project 
engages with three areas of scholarship: Western and Eastern ontological 
doctrines, Hawking-Penrose quantum big-bang cosmology, and modern 
cosmological achievements. The motif of the project rests in the following three 
research objectives: 
1. Decentering the nostalgic classical ontologies in the West and the 
East by constructing a synthesis to establish a collective modern 
onto-cosmology; 
2. Decentering the Confucian metaphysical understandings of the 
Heaven-Human-Earth ideology by emphasizing Daoist onto-
cosmology; and, 
3. Decentering the general quantum big-bang cosmological formalism 
by emphasizing a cyclic model of the known universe by 
incorporating the quantum-gravity big-bang theory. 
The first objective aims at decentering the classical ontologies. In world 
history, the West and the East have been isolated from each other from the 
beginning of the ancient human civilization until 1840, and that despite the three 
Christian contacts of 635, 1294, and 1582, respectively (Ma, 2016a). From the 
late Qing dynasty (晚清1840–1911) in the 19th century, especially after 1979 
when Deng Xiao-ping (邓小平1904–1997) adopted an opening-up policy in 
PREVIEW

 4
China, the Sino-Western cultural exchange has developed smoothly, and China 
has transited from a country isolated from the world to one that is merged into the 
world (C. Yang, 2014, pp. 3–13).  
However, it is necessary to integrate Western Christian onto-theological 
cosmology with the Eastern cosmic mindfulness of the Heaven–Humanity 
Oneness (tianren heyi 天人合一). The importance of the integration lies in setting 
up an appropriate onto-cosmological paradigm harmonic to the achievements in 
modern physics and astronomy. This dissertation will provide the synthesis of 
East and West to produce an onto-cosmology which is rooted in both. 
The second objective focuses on decentering Chinese Neo-Confucianism. 
Confucianism was the leading political philosophy in China. It emphasized the 
humanistic legitimacy of duty, obedience, and hierarchy to uphold legal practice, 
family morality, and social ethics. It reinforced the policies of China dynasty after 
dynasty. Confucianism was used officially as a brand to represent ancient Chinese 
civilization. By contrast, neo-Confucianism refers to the philosophy equipped 
with Daoist onto-cosmology while complying with Confucian social and ethical 
rules. Specifically, it shares with Daoism a common onto-cosmological root 
(Wilhelm, 1990, p. xlvii). For this reason, the numero-cosmological Treatise of 
Supreme World-Ordering Principles (huangji jingshi shu 皇极经世书) (e.g., 
Shao, dyn.Song-a1), written by one of the six outstanding neo-Confucian elites, 
Shao Yong (邵雍1011–1070), was not classified as a Confucian masterpiece but 
 
1 A few classical Chinese literatures are out of exact publishing years. They are 
cited in the text by giving the Dynasty (dyn.) when they came into being.

a Daoist one. It was collected in the Daoist Treasury (daozang 道藏) (e.g., Yao, 
2013, pp. 273–274; Y. Shao, dyn.Song-b). This dissertation will bring Shao 
Yong’s numero-cosmology into conversation with modern big-bang theory. 
The last objective concentrates on decentering the prevailing physical 
models in the quantum big-bang cosmology and quantum brain consciousness. 
There are two significant issues to consider. The first issue is Hawking-Penrose’s 
quantum big-bang model (Hawking, 1996; Penrose, 2005, 2012a, 2014); and the 
second one is Penrose-Hameroff’s cosmic quantum-brain model, ORCHestrated 
Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) (Hameroff & Penrose, 2003, 2014; Penrose & 
Hameroff, 2011; Penrose, Hameroff, & Stapp, 2011).  
The former one verifies that it is the quantum process that is the primal 
source for the universe to expand outward from a single point (e.g., Penrose, 
2012b). A model of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) describes the evolution 
of the world which iterates through infinite cycles. In the process, the future time-
like infinity of each previous iteration repeats the big-bang singularity of the next. 
Unfortunately, the CCC model is unsatisfactory in two aspects. On the one side, it 
does not admit the exponentially growing inflation phase after the big-bang 
singularity. On the other side, it predicts an unrealistic actual time scale of one 
cycle, eon, which is beyond 10100 years.  
Different from the first big-bang issue, the latter one is the Orch-OR 
formalism (e.g., Penrose, 1989). It connects brain biomolecular processes to the 
cosmic fine-scale structure. However, the obtained brain EEG waves are unable to 
PREVIEW

 6
be compatible with laboratory measurements. This dissertation will propose an 
improved model within the regime of the formulated modern onto-cosmology. 
Methodologies of Approach 
The new onto-cosmology to be articulated in this dissertation will provide 
an adequate account of the origin and evolution of both the observable universe 
and the hidden multiverse. A deeper understanding of reality can thereby be 
attained. Given the entire history of civilization, human beings are limited to one 
universe only. What is more, they have a limited capacity of naked eyes and 
telescopes.  
Nevertheless, humanity is the “hominized” form of cosmological 
processes. It is endowed with a natural awakening to the creative dynamics of 
reality. In total, there are three epistemological steps in the awaking2 (Baynes, 
1891, p. 97; Baynes & Smith 1902, p. 91; Mou, 2009, pp. 76–77): 
1. Comprehensive Conception (guan 观). This step gives rise to an 
experience-independent (i.e., a priori) intentionality.3 It is performed 
by evolving dominantly from “within” (i.e., inside or the self) about 
the nature of reality to form a subjective principle; 
 
2 The three steps are consistent with the nine Buddhist consciousnesses and the 
four psychological forces (e.g., Ma, 2016b).  
3According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Siewart, 2017, 
“Interpretation of Intentionality”), “intentionality” is the aboutness or directedness or 
reference of mind (or states of mind) to things, objects, states of affairs, events. That is, it 
is a prior conscious ability for humans to arise before any experience or contact with 
external objects (see discussions given in Siewart’s article). 
PREVIEW

 7
2. Reflective Response (gan 感). This step contributes to an experience-
dependent (i.e., a posteriori) consciousness by evolving dominantly 
from “without” (i.e., outside; or, what is not the self) about the 
nature of reality to form an objective ground; 
3. Contemplative Awakening (jue 觉). This step integrates the first two 
through understanding both the subjective and objective aspects of 
reality, to form a transcending consciousness.  
In the historical development toward a new onto-cosmological paradigm, 
there are three typical onto-cosmological archetypes:  
• Daoist metaphysical onto-cosmology; 
• Hawking-Penrose’s quantum big-bang onto-cosmology; and  
• Teilhard-Berry’s panentheistic onto-cosmology.  
Toward the previously mentioned objectives, this dissertation will employ an 
appropriate and hermeneutic approach to attaining the innovative paradigm with 
the following three methodologies: 
1. Empirical approach. Rather than theoretical research, which brings 
its challenges in terms of applicability, this dissertation relies on a 
practical approach by making use of primary and secondary sources. 
The former source rests on the original Chinese classics. The 
scriptures are collected, translated, and analyzed to achieve the goal 
of the study. The latter source is chosen from publications available 
online or in the library. Papers or books are examined and selected 
PREVIEW

 8
on account of their relevance to the theme of the study. Footnotes are 
also given wherever a reference is trivial yet necessary. 
2. Inductive approach. Instead of deductive research emphasizing 
theory-testing via datasets, surveys, or quantitative analysis, this 
dissertation proposes a new onto-cosmological paradigm based on 
researching and interpreting Daoist teachings and scientific 
achievements. For this purpose, a set of three models, as follows, 
will be introduced and evaluated: 
• Shao Yong’s supreme world-ordering principles; 
• Hawking-Penrose’s quantum big-bang mechanism; and 
• Teilhard-Berry’s panentheistic trinity and evolution. 
3. Scientific approach. Different from the research on metaphysics 
featured by a speculative consciousness over and beyond physics, 
this thesis stands on the bases of consolidated knowledge in: 
• Shao Yong’s lunisolar calendarial system in the 
hexagrammatic categories of the Yijing (also I-Ching 易经; 
e.g., Legge, 1963; Sung, 1973). It offers a correlative4 onto-
cosmology (e.g., J. Needham & Ling, 1956, pp. 279–281; 
Raphals, 2013, p. 328). It follows a holofractal and holographic 
 
4 The word “correlative” comes from the conception of causality (i.e., cause-
effect action), or stimulus and response; or, simply, resonance (gan-ying 感应).

principle5 (c.f. Lefferts, 2014) of the numerological 
arrangements. It gives a unique, concise, abstractive, and 
cyclical evolutionary perspective of reality. 
• Friedmann and Penrose’s modern cosmology. The Friedmann 
theory describes an evolving universe (Friedman, 1922) with 
two different evolving modes (Belenkly, 2012). One is a 
monotonic, decelerating expansion. The expansion happens 
from a zero-radius singularity until an inflection point. After 
that, either an accelerating development begins from a nonzero 
initial radius, or, an oscillating expansion is obtained. The other 
one is the periodic scenario which describes the cosmos to 
evolve from and back to zero space. Complementary to the 
above, Hawking-Penrose theorem predicts space-time 
singularities of relativistic gravitational collapse and 
cosmology (Hawking & Penrose, 1970). Penrose’s CCC model 
assumes a cyclic multiverse. This multiverse consists of an 
infinite sequence of cycles (e.g., Penrose, 2012a). Also, 
Penrose-Hameroff’s Orch-OR formalism was proven to 
connect brain biomolecular processes with cosmic fine-scale 
structures (Penrose, 1989).
