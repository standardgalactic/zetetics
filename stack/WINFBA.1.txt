Acknowledgements
Many people have contributed significantly to this dissertation and to my
graduate school experience. Elisabeth Lloyd, as thesis advisor and friend, was
always there with advice and support at every critical occasion. Her perceptive
critique of my work, as well as her exposition of the semantic view of theories,
were crucial for my philosophical growth. Michael Wade was the best biology
mentor I could have wished for. Working with him on a masters project,
published paper, and dissertation all influenced me to be biologically aware.
Frederick Schmitt was essential in connecting my work to traditional
philosophical concerns, especially those of metaphysics and epistemology.
Sander Gliboff graciously agreed to serve on my committee at very short notice
and wisely encouraged me to think about chemical modeling.
I feel extremely fortunate to have interacted with many other inspirational
professors from various disciplines. I want to thank three of them in particular.
Peter Godfrey-Smith, my undergraduate and masters advisor at Stanford,
tirelessly and gently helped eliminate the worst of my philosophical naiveté
(much still remains). Elihu Gerson, a sociologist and independent scholar, taught
me much about the broader aspects of social structure in science, academia, and
culture at large. Susan Oyama presented an intellectual framework,
developmental systems theory, that inspired me to write a masters thesis in
philosophy of biology.
My research at Indiana University was funded primarily by the History
and Philosophy of Science Department (HPS), but aid was also granted by the
Biology Department. My parents provided financial support especially during

vi
the wonderful dissertation year spent in San Francisco. Rebecca Wood, as
administrative assistant of HPSC, selflessly assisted me in endless administrative
matters.
My years in graduate school were, in a number of ways, the best of my
life. They were a gift. In large part this is due to the friends that have made the
person who exits graduate school very different from the one who entered it. My
unwillingness to name or "list" them, or to explain my individual debts to each of
them, probably stems from the sense that so many moments with them have had
an almost mystical and multi-dimensional quality that cannot (should not?) be
captured in printed words (at least not in the words to which one is constrained
in an acknowledgements section of a dissertation!).
Two special debts remain. First, my parents have always provided me
with the best possible conditions, including growing up as part of a Danish
family in Venezuela attending an American International school. This helped me
understand the infinite variety and possibility of human expression. Now, as I
move to do a post-doc at one of the world's largest universities, the UNAM in
Mexico City, I look forward to experiencing, in a new way, cultural variety and
possibility.  In a sense, this dissertation is also about the difference between two
cultures of biological research! Second, Amir Najmi, faithful friend and, if I may,
elder brother over the last decade, was a sine qua non for this dissertation.
To All: Thanks. Gracias. Tak.

FORMAL BIOLOGY AND COMPOSITIONAL BIOLOGY AS TWO KINDS OF
BIOLOGICAL THEORIZING
There are two fundamentally distinct kinds of biological theorizing.
"Formal biology" focuses on the relations, captured in formal laws, among
mathematically abstracted properties of abstract objects. Population genetics and
theoretical mathematical ecology, which are cases of formal biology, thus share
methods and goals with theoretical physics. "Compositional biology," on the
other hand, is concerned with articulating the concrete structure, mechanisms,
and function, through developmental and evolutionary time, of material parts
and wholes. Molecular genetics, biochemistry, developmental biology, and
physiology, which are examples of compositional biology, are in serious need of
philosophical attention. For example, the very concept of a "part" is understudied
in both philosophy of biology and philosophy of science.
My dissertation is an attempt to clarify the distinction between formal
biology and compositional biology and, in so doing, provide a clear
philosophical analysis, with case studies, of compositional biology. Given the
social, economic, and medical importance of compositional biology,
understanding it is urgent. For my investigation, I draw on the philosophical
fields of metaphysics and epistemology, as well as philosophy of biology and
philosophy of science. I suggest new ways of thinking about some classic
philosophy of science issues, such as modeling, laws of nature, abstraction,
explanation, and confirmation. I hint at the relevance of my study of two kinds of
biological theorizing to debates concerning the disunity of science.

Introduction
The fundamental point of this dissertation is to construct, explore, and
defend a fundamental difference between two kinds of theorizing in biology:
formal and compositional. Briefly, formal biology focuses on finding relations,
often captured in the form of laws, among mathematically abstracted properties
of abstract objects. These laws both serve as the foundation for, and are extracted
from, the mathematical models characteristic of formal biology (e.g.,
mathematical evolutionary genetics and theoretical mathematical ecology). Note
that by laws here I do not mean sentences written in first-order logic (or, more
generally, metamathematics), but rather claims expressed in mathematics, as is
the case in actual scientific practice.
In contrast to formal biology, compositional biology includes areas of
biology, such as molecular genetics, biochemistry, developmental biology, and
physiology that are concerned with articulating the concrete structure,
mechanisms, and function, through developmental and evolutionary time, of
material parts and wholes. Compositional biology is in serious need of
philosophical attention; for example, the very concept of "part" is understudied
in both philosophy of biology and philosophy of science. By analyzing this form
of biology, I hope to bring forward a set of new possibilities and pictures
regarding abstraction, part organization, models and modeling, explanation, and
confirmation.
Another way to motivate the distinction between formal and
compositional biology is to note that focusing on "parts" might seem quaint,

Introduction
2
irrelevant, and even bizarre to most philosophers of biology and philosophers of
science. The concrete nature and theoretical role of parts are rarely considered
topics worthy of direct analysis. It is remarkable that so little philosophical
attention has been given to parts, considering the ubiquity of part organization in
the subject matter of biology. Most research in biological science concerns
relations of compositionality rather than of abstraction, whereas the inverse is the
case in the investigations of philosophy of biology and philosophy of science.
The central relation between the one and the many in compositional biology is
one of object compositionality through the aggregation (in the broadest sense of
the term) of many parts in order to produce one whole. In contrast, in formal
biology, the central relation between the one and the many is one of object
abstraction through the removal of many, and the concomitant focus on a few,
properties (often mathematical), in order to produce one kind from many
instances. The concern of this dissertation is compositionality, a topic not
previously explored in a systematic way in philosophy of biology.
My distinction between two kinds of biology is meant to capture
differences in theoretical or empirical methodology more than differences in
ontological domains of study. That is, both kinds of biology could conceivably, and
in some cases do, focus on the same domain and even ask similar kinds of
questions, but bring different conceptual and material tools to the analysis. In
some areas, such as the field(s) studying the relation between evolution and
development, a process, such as the evolution of multicellularity, can be
analyzed from the perspective of either kind of biology even if particular
investigators often adhere to one form of biology over the other. Having said
this, certainly there is a strong correlation between ontological domain and

Introduction
3
methodology for many, if not most, other areas. For example, the study of
evolutionary changes in gene frequencies is formal whereas the investigation of
physiology is compositional. Regardless of the actual relationship between
ontological domain and methodology in any given area, I make the distinction
between the two kinds of biology based primarily on their respective theoretical
and empirical biases and practices, rather than the biological domains that they
study.
Before I turn to a detailed explication of each chapter, let me provide a
brief account of each chapter followed by an explanation of the logic of the
dissertation organization. In Chapter 1, I provide a philosophical framework that
grounds, and allows for the diagnosis of, the two kinds of biology. This
framework borrows heavily from literature in metaphysics and epistemology; it
also employs theoretical physics as both a useful "sister group" to formal biology,
and as a contrast to compositional biology. In Chapter 2, I develop the notion of a
theoretical perspective, which I use for the remainder of the dissertation. In this
chapter, I utilize that notion to understand, in detail, the varied disciplines of
compositional biology, such as functional morphology, developmental biology,
and biochemistry. In Chapter 3, I explore a contemporary set of debates found in
the disciplines attempting to synthesize evolutionary and developmental
phenomena. This is an area, with historical roots going back at least to Darwin,
where the two kinds of biology meet and, potentially, clash.
In the remaining two chapters, I explore, in the context of my distinction,
two classic topics in philosophy of science, models (and modeling) and
explanation. In Chapter 4, I articulate four general properties of models and then
show how the primarily non-mathematical models of compositional biology do

Introduction
4
indeed meet these properties. In Chapter 5, I contrast the very different
explanatory patterns that formal and compositional biology exhibit. The pattern
present in formal biology is much more familiar to philosophers of biology and
philosophers of science than the one present in compositional biology.
I have chosen this organization to try to achieve two goals. First, I want to
show that distinct areas of philosophy, including metaphysics and epistemology,
as well as philosophy of science, can be used to analyze and clarify biological
practice, empirical and theoretical alike. It is not always clear that especially
metaphysics and epistemology can be made relevant to an analysis of the
practices of fields as important to contemporary society as developmental
biology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics (all cases of compositional
biology). I hope to show especially in Chapters 1, 4, and 5 that philosophy can be
made relevant. Chapter 1 uses tools from metaphysics and epistemology.
Chapters 4 and 5 employ methods and frameworks from philosophy of biology
and philosophy of science, and are also a plea for using compositional biology to
develop a new picture regarding abstraction, models and modeling, explanation,
and confirmation in order to expand philosophy of science.
The second goal is to analyze compositional biology from many different
angles in order to clearly explicate what it is. After clearly distinguishing it from
formal biology in the first chapter, I provide, in Chapter 2, an in-depth analysis
of a variety of different disciplines, and theoretical perspectives, in compositional
biology. I continue this detailed analysis in Chapter 4, where I analyze different
models and modeling techniques from different compositional biological
sciences. In contrast, as I do in Chapter 1, Chapters 3 and 5 are balanced in terms
of the attention given to both formal biology and compositional biology. The

Introduction
5
odd-numbered chapters thus provide a comparative context in which to
comprehend compositional biology. I hope that the dissertation provides a broad
and robust understanding of compositional biology.
I will now turn to a summary of the content of each chapter.
In Chapter 1, I develop a framework of philosophical distinctions,
regarding four theoretical commitments, that can be applied to differentiate the
two kinds of biology. These are: (1) the assumed causal structure of the objects
studied, (2) the way abstraction of objects into kinds is made, (3) the model types
employed, and (4) the relevance and nature of part organization. The basic
pattern of commitments in formal biology is to assume and employ: (1F) simple
objects consisting of a few idealized causal factors, (2F) simple abstraction, which
is premised on necessary and sufficient conditions (I also call this "Locke-(C.I.)
Lewis" abstraction), (3F) mathematical models, and (4F) irrelevant or highly
idealized part organization. The basic pattern of commitments in compositional
biology is to focus on: (1C) complex objects that are themselves parts of larger
wholes, which have many kinds of causal factors, (2C) complex abstraction,
which is patchy and messy (I also call this "Wittgenstein-Boyd" abstraction), (3C)
propositional non-mathematical models and material models, and (4C) the
hierarchical and integrated organization and functioning of concrete biological
systems. These are all reasonable commitments for the kind of scientific work
each of the two kinds of biology have defined for themselves historically,
socially, and philosophically.
In Chapter 2, I expand the notion of "theoretical perspectives" in order to
provide a conceptual tool for analysis of the different ways that distinct
disciplines of compositional biology partition a system, especially the organism. I

Introduction
6
compare and contrast the views of Kauffman, Wimsatt, and Griesemer on
theoretical perspectives, and develop my own position. In particular, I argue that
a perspective could be thought of either as a collection of all the activity related to
it, or as the set of biases and assumptions guiding this activity. I defend and
employ the view that for purposes of philosophical analysis, the latter is the
appropriate understanding. I also develop the idea of a theoretical perspective's
"partitioning frame," which is the set of biases and assumptions guiding the ways
in which the perspective identifies and individuates parts. I look to the canonical
textbooks of different disciplines of compositional biology to explicate the
partitioning frame of that particular theoretical perspective (e.g., physiology or
developmental biology). Each of these fields partitions the same "object" (e.g., the
organism) differently through their respective employment of a specific
partitioning frame. Formal biology does not work in this way. I summarize my
analysis with a table presenting "examples of parts," "criteria of the partitioning
frame," and "general list of guiding biases" for each theoretical perspective of
compositional biology analyzed.
In Chapter 3, I address, through a case study, the possibility of synthesis
and unification between the two kinds of biology. The relationships between the
phenomena of, and theories about, development and evolution remain
mysterious. The current avatar of this relationship is the one between the
disciplines of levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology.
By explicating a hierarchical view of theoretical perspectives, I show that levels
of selection theory is an example of both formal biology and the "competition
perspective," whereas evolutionary developmental biology is a case of both
compositional biology and the "integration perspective." In both cases, these

Introduction
7
concrete fields "inherit" the guiding biases and assumptions of the higher-level
perspectives in addition to adding their own. I then elaborate, using key research
papers and books as well as communications with scientists, the respective
theories and experiments of these two fields for both the organism and social
insect colonies, which are objects at two different levels of the biological
hierarchy. It becomes clear that the two fields are methodologically different,
even when studying the same objects. I also show the difference between the two
fields by developing, conceptually, other aspects of a theoretical perspective,
such as explanatory resources employed, and the meaning of key terms.
(Providing a full conceptual anatomy of a theoretical perspective is one of my
future projects.) In concluding the chapter, I elaborate on various interpretations
regarding the relationships between the two fields. In doing this, I evaluate the
prospects of a synthesis between the two, without arriving at a firm conclusion.
In Chapter 4, I address the issue of models and modeling in biology. I
review two different analyses of models and modeling, the semantic view of
theories and the mediating model view. I also consider two non-standard views,
Griesemer's and Downes' respective expansive and deflationary accounts. In
addition, I present two very distinct views on abstraction stemming from
Cartwright and Friedman. Inspired by these varied presentations on models and
modeling as well as on abstraction, I propose four general properties for models:
(1) models are meaning structures of various types and at various levels of
abstraction, (2) models can be "hooked up" with other models, subject to the
background protocols and assumptions of the theoretical perspectives guiding
such articulation of models, (3) models in biology are subject to trade-offs among
pragmatic desiderata – for example a general model is rarely a realistic one, and

Introduction
8
(4) models are used in a variety of scientific activities, including guiding further
modeling and empirical activity, as well as providing explanations.
For the rest of Chapter 4, I show how different models of compositional
biology meet these properties, and should therefore be considered proper
models. However, this does not imply that modeling, as a theoretical activity, is
as prevalent in compositional biology as it is in formal biology. In fact, I argue
that while models are prevalent in compositional biology, modeling independent
of empirical activity is rare. The picture of the activity of modeling, as well as of
explanation stemming from models and the confirmation of models, is very
different in compositional biology as compared to all the standard philosophy of
science analyses of modeling, which are pertinent only to formal biology. It is to a
contrast of these two pictures that I turn in Chapter 5.
In Chapter 5, I distinguish the very different ways in which the two kinds
of biology produce explanations. Despite the presence of models in both kinds of
biology, the forms of modeling and explanation are distinct. I present five
differences. (1) The model meaning structures in formal biology are formal law-
like relations between abstract mathematical properties, whereas in
compositional biology they are presentations of the compositional and functional
(sensu Cummins) organization of the system. (2) In formal biology, modeling
activity and empirical activity are easy to differentiate, but they are difficult to
distinguish in compositional biology. (3) Model articulation (theoretical
explanation) in formal biology is a mathematically abstract activity independent
of empirical evaluation, as described, for example, in Friedman's account of
theoretical unification, whereas in compositional biology, model articulation is
intimately tied to empirical activity, including the practice of model evaluation.

Introduction

(4) Model application (causal explanation) works similarly in the two kinds of
biology in so far as a general model is applied to a particular concrete system to
explain aspects of it; however, in formal biology, formal causal relations are
explained, as detailed in Cartwright's work, whereas in compositional biology,
compositional and functional relations are explained, as presented in Cummins'
analysis. (5) Model evaluation (confirmation) in formal biology follows protocols
explicated by the semantic view (e.g., goodness-of-fit tests), whereas in
compositional biology methods of "qualitative" confirmation have not yet been
developed. Given the close relationship between theoretical and empirical
activity in compositional biology, however, it seems clear that (dis)confirmation
of a model can easily lead to straightforward changes in the meaning structures;
this contrasts with formal biology, where assumptions as well as the functional
mathematical relations between variables often have to be fundamentally revised
in response to model disconfirmation.
This dissertation, thus, seeks to provide a framework that will allow us to
begin to philosophically understand extremely important understudied
biological sciences. Given the social, economic, and medical urgency of many
compositional biological sciences, we could fruitfully spend significantly more
effort understanding them. We lose relevance as well as insight by focusing on
biological sciences rich in mathematical theoretical structure. In articulating my
conceptual analysis, I hope to have shown that different areas of philosophy can
be made applicable and relevant. In addition, as a feedback effect—science to
philosophy, rather than philosophy to science—I believe that a study of
compositional biology will lay the grounds for a clear expansion, in philosophy
of science, of our picture of the development, structure, and application of both

theory and models. It is time to move beyond the picture provided by
philosophers of science focusing on abstractive and formalistic science, as useful
as their efforts have been.

Chapter 1: A Philosophical Framework Grounding the Distinction Between
Formal and Compositional Biology
1.1 Framing and Goals
In this chapter I provide a philosophical framework, using tools from
metaphysics and epistemology, that will allow us to establish and characterize a
heretofore unrecognized difference between formal and compositional biology.
Formal biology focuses on the relations, governed by formal laws, among the
mathematically-abstracted properties of abstract objects. Particular kinds of
mathematical models capture these relations, as we shall see. Formal biology,
including especially mathematical evolutionary genetics and theoretical
mathematical ecology, shares similarities with theoretical physics and, therefore,
I will often, for convenience, employ examples from theoretical physics to help
characterize the features it has in common with formal biology.
Conversely, compositional biology, which includes areas of biology, such
as molecular genetics, biochemistry, developmental biology, physiology, and
systematics, is concerned with articulating the concrete structure, mechanisms,
and function, current as well as through developmental and evolutionary time,
of material parts and wholes. Although compositional biology does seek
generalizations, it shies away from laws of the abstractly formal – God is in the
details, the Devil in the abstractions. Both sciences seek generalizations, but, as

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
12
we shall see, they achieve it in different ways and the extent and type of
generalization is quite different in each.
The difference between these two kinds of biology is captured in my
framework articulating four distinctions (pertinent to four abstract commitments
made in each kind of biology)1: (1) simple vs. complex objects (the assumed
causal structure of the objects studied), (2) simple vs. complex abstraction (the
form of abstraction of objects into kinds), (3) mathematical vs. propositional non-
mathematical or material models (the prevalent types of models employed), (4)
irrelevance or idealized vs. relevance of part-whole organization2 (relevance and
nature of compositional organization). This chapter is arranged around an
explication of each of these four distinctions. For each distinction, I first provide a
general account of what is involved in making that commitment in the first place
(e.g., assumed causal structure of the objects studied). I then present how formal
and compositional biology make distinct, and opposing, assumptions regarding
that particular commitment (e.g., simple vs. complex objects).
Note that these distinctions have their sequential arrangement for a
reason. The first three concern kinds and abstraction. Although the first is also an
ontological distinction, the ontology is conditioned by the theory studying those
objects. The last concerns mereological3 relations and patterns, which, as I argue
below, is a distinct issue from abstraction relations and patterns. In articulating
these four distinctions, note also that I am explicitly naturalizing my analysis in
                                                  
1 In Chapter 5, I will add a fifth distinction, concerning pattern of scientific
explanation, to this list. In the current chapter I do not further develop this
distinction since it is a very complex one requiring significant explication.
2 "Organization" is here shorthand for structure, process, and function.
3 "Mereology" is the philosophical study of parts and wholes. It is a little-known
subfield of philosophy.

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
13
what the scientific theories actually endorse. That is, I use philosophy to explicate
science, but science provides the data for this analysis.
1.2 Simple versus Complex Objects
The first distinction regards the causal structure of the concrete objects
investigated by a science. First, given the naturalistic proclivities of my analysis, I
want to emphasize that it is to the scientific theory4 that we must turn if we want
to learn what the pertinent types of causal factors are. In general, I consider types
of causal factor as types of interactions that an object can engage in; a particular
causal factor makes a difference to a particular outcome.5
Simplicity and complexity of the causal structure of the objects, I claim,
has to do with the neatness6 and number of causal factors7 involved in (1)
                                                  
4 In Chapter 2, I develop in detail the concept of "theoretical perspective," which
is a coherent and integrated unit of scientific theory (at various levels of
generality), which, at its lowest level of generality, is associated with a discipline,
such as mathematical evolutionary genetics (formal biology) or developmental
biology (compositional biology).
5 The literature on causation is quite complex, yet there is little material on how
to individuate a causal factor, or even a type of causal factor. Often the division of
processes into types of causal factors (and types of outcomes) is taken for
granted. I believe that turning to the scientific theory is of help here.
Furthermore, some of the literature has defined causal factors generally as a
"difference maker" and I believe this to be a workable definition of what a causal
factor does in a particular case even if it does not tell us what the types of factors
are appealed to by the theory (Cartwright 1989; Jennings 1913; Mackie 1974; Mill
1904; Strevens 2004 in press).
6 By "neatness" and "neat" I mean something like clearly articulated theoretically
and with little variation in causal effect within types of causal factors. For
example, we know how to clearly relate, mathematically, fitness to change in
gene frequency. But the mechanisms of cell signaling are incredibly diverse, and
output type (i.e., what the cell does in response) varies tremendously among
different cell types, different cell signaling structures, and different taxa. There is

forming an object and (2) the continued interaction of the object with other
objects, of the same or of different kinds, around it. For simple objects, there are a
small number of relatively neat causal factors that interact to produce reliably
equivalent concrete objects with reliably repeated causal capacities8. Examples of
this are electrons, chemical elements, and, I argue below, the genes of
mathematical evolutionary genetics. For complex objects, there are a large
number of relatively messy causal factors that form diverse concrete objects
different from one another and with somewhat different causal capacities, even if
such objects share aspects of their history and capacities. Examples of this are
livers of different Homo sapiens organisms, or even homologous genes in
different taxa.
The distinction between simple and complex objects is meant to capture
the equivalence or diversity of objects produced from, or engaged with, causal
factors of varying number and neatness. Thus simple objects are equivalent in
terms of their (1) history – the same forces of oxygen and hydrogen electron shell
dynamics and structure form any molecule of water, and (2) causal capacity –
under given conditions, any electron will behave in the same way as any other
electron. Complex objects of a type are unique in terms of their (1) historical
diversity – livers in different humans develop in slightly different ways,
sometimes even qualitatively so, leading to morphological or physiological
"abnormalities", and (2) causal capacity diversity – livers in different humans,
                                                                                                                                                      
no clear theoretical relation between, for example, particular cell signaling
structure and outcome.
7 Unless otherwise noted, "causal factors" is equivalent to "types of causal
factors."

concept interchangeable with "type of causal factor."

and certainly in related species, have different levels and even kinds of
functioning.
Another sense in which objects are simple or complex has to do with the
total number of causal factors available in a theory. Biological sciences studying
simple objects tend to have few total numbers of causal factors, whereas those
studying complex objects, tend to have many total numbers of causal factors.  In
mathematical evolutionary genetics, as we shall see, there are relatively few
forces theoretically ascribed to the central objects, genes. These are
selection/fitness, drift, mutation, and population structure, which introduces
levels of selection concerns, as we shall see in Chapter 3. In developmental
biology there are many causal factors, such as signaling, movement, and death
among cells, that can exist at various levels, including molecular, cellular, and
organ.
Furthermore, even if a particular object in developmental biology, an
example of compositional biology, is ascribed few causal factors (which is a
possibility even if there are many total causal factors), making it somewhat
simple, that object is analyzed from a variety of other theories that ascribe their
own causal factors. For example, when physiology or functional morphology, as
we shall see in Chapter 2, import their own causal structure, the object becomes
much more complex from this "inter-theoretical" viewpoint. The variety of
compatible theories present in compositional biology, but not in formal biology,
adds another layer of complexity to the causal structure of the objects it studies.
Now that I have explicated causal complexity generally in terms of the
messiness and high number of (types of) causal factors both within and across
theories investigating a particular object, let me turn to an application of this

description to the two kinds of biology, using examples from chemistry and
theoretical physics, when applicable to formal biology.
Formal biology focuses on simple objects. These are the objects in nature
for which few and neat causal forces are involved in their origin and their
subsequent interactions. Examples include most of the objects of physics: masses,
electrons, photons, atoms, populations of particles in a gas. These are all objects
for which a few precise essential properties can be captured. Useful theory can be
produced for, say, any and every electron – they are all equivalent to one
another. Furthermore, despite the fact that, for example, photons come in many
frequencies, they are quantized and we can come up with very abstract and
general descriptions of them that apply to all of them (e.g., Maxwell's laws). Even
populations of particles in a gas are subject to relatively few and well-understood
forces.9 All these objects are excellent candidates for a neat abstraction hierarchy
with necessary and sufficient conditions, as we shall see in the section 3 of this
chapter. Furthermore, there is roughly only one theory applicable and relevant to
each. This is not to say that these objects are perfectly simple objects. There are
degrees even here – numerous gases and numerous conditions are such that the
ideal gas law does not hold, but such gases are still simple objects in that they are
chemical compounds of a certain kind and, at least under some interpretations of
physics, highly abstract laws are powerful explanatory devices of the causal
structure of objects.
Biology, in general, suggests a very different ontology from theoretical
physics or the chemistry of elements and simple compounds. First of all, the

concrete objects of biology can often be interpreted and manipulated from a
broad multiplicity of theories. Unlike many concrete simple objects in physics,
the concrete object "gene" can be described from a wide variety of perspectives.10
Clearly there are multiple causes, even multiple kinds of causes from different
theories,11 for the origin and interaction of genes. But let us focus on the genes of
mathematical evolutionary genetics. Let us focus on the practice, and ontology
implied, by this powerful discipline.
Unlike many other areas of biology, and even other areas of the physical
sciences, mathematical evolutionary genetics, a paradigm case of formal biology,
is highly driven by theoretical concerns and mathematical models.12 In such a
(mathematically) abstract discipline, it is admittedly difficult, if not paradoxical,
to articulate what their ontology is. What do they believe about the "objects" they
study—are these objects simple or complex objects—if confirmation of their
models is relatively rare and, more important, difficult? So there is an element of
indeterminateness in their ontological position stemming from the lack of
concretization of their postulated objects.
In so far as we can discuss their ontological position, mathematical
evolutionary genetics refers to objects that are both more complex (i.e., more
                                                  
10 In theoretical physics, there are, of course, exceptions to this point – the wave-
particle duality of quantum mechanics is one such case. (Wade pers. comm.) I
want to note that it is certainly beyond the scope of this dissertation to develop
the ontology of theoretical physics. I rely on intuitions regarding physics in order
to motivate the distinction between formal and compositional biology.
11 The overlap and synthesis of these perspectives, as well as the different kinds
of causes they refer to, is conceptually unclear and will be one of the central
concerns of Chapter 3, where I discuss evolutionary developmental biology and
levels of selection theory.
12 See, e.g., Lewontin 1974. The emphasis on mathematical modeling in this field
accounts, at least in part, for the relative ease with which anti-realist, or "realism
neutral," interpretations can be provided for it; see, e.g., Lloyd 1988 and, for a
different view on the same issue, Rosenberg 1994.

variation, less equivalent, less neat causal factors) than the simple objects of
theoretical physics, yet also simpler, and more rigid, than the complex and
qualitatively variable (types of) complex objects of compositional biological
sciences, such as developmental biology and physiology. Put more strongly, the
genes of mathematical evolutionary genetics, while not simple and not caused, or
interacting, by extremely few and neat causal forces, do have much more in
common with the point masses of Newtonian mechanics than they do with the
livers of physiology or even the concrete regulating genes of developmental
biology. This might seem surprising to those of us trained to view large-scaled
scientific differences in terms of content-matter rather than in terms of practice or
styles of analysis, both of which are included in scientific theory. Let me specify
my argument more clearly.
Mathematical evolutionary genetics typically postulates a handful of
causal factors: (1) selection, (2) mutation, (3) genetic drift and (4) population
structure, which raises concerns regarding inbreeding and levels of selection.
These factors are clearly defined mathematically and their consequences on gene
frequency well understood. As long as alleles at particular loci are subject to the
same forces13 under the same idealizing assumptions, then the same
consequences will occur, whether they are loci "for" an enzyme involved in the
breakdown of an amino acid or a gene regulating protein. There is no variation
in effect from the causal force point of view, even though, of course, the alleles,
whether at the same or at different loci, vary in nucleotide sequence.
                                                  
13 On evolutionary causal factors as "forces" see Sober 1984. Note that the analogy
between Newtonian mechanics and evolutionary genetics is explicit here. I
discuss the presence of forces and laws in mathematical evolutionary genetics in
Appendix A.

Mathematical evolutionary genetics postulates simple objects: a few clearly-
defined and neat causal factors (of particular types, described by the "forces of
evolution") constitute the full suite that change gene frequencies, regardless of
the actual role of the genes in concrete biological processes. Simple objects are
subject to equivalent consequences determined by few and well-defined causal
factors.
The causal structure of the objects of fields such as developmental biology
and physiology is certainly not indeterminate since the focus of these fields is on
the structure, process, and function of concrete objects. These objects are clearly
complex objects and are parts of a system. First of all, there is clear variation in
the objects of the same kind, both in terms of the causal forces involved in their
history, in their causal capacities, and in their very descriptive attributes (e.g.,
liver size, function, cell number). And there is no short list of mathematical
causal forces involved. The list of causal factors for these sciences is (indefinitely)
long and the factors are qualitative and not amenable to parameterization.
Furthermore, there are a variety of theories from which to interpret, say, a
kidney: comparative morphology, physiology, and developmental biology (as
we shall see in Chapter 2). These theories have their own unique commitments to
causal structure. The causal structure of the objects of compositional biology is
detailed, qualitative and diverse – in short, complex.
Formal biology (e.g., evolutionary mathematical genetics) postulates
concrete objects that are simple objects, subject to few well-defined causal forces
leading to equivalent outcomes. Admittedly, these are not as simple and
variation-free as the elements of chemistry or the fundamental particles of
theoretical physics, nor are they concrete in the same way, but the model-based

practice of evolutionary genetics does suggest objects with the same sorts of
properties as those of formal physical science. Compositional biology (e.g.,
developmental biology, physiology, biochemistry, even systematics) actively
investigates concrete objects that are quite complex and are parts of larger
systems. God (i.e., that which is desired and exalted in the field) is in the complex
details here – that is the causal structure of the objects studied. The active
investigation of the different and unique, of complex objects that stick out from
their peers of the same kind, (e.g., the homeotic mutant to determine the effect of
regulating genes or the genetic knockout to determine steps in biochemical
pathways) is rewarded. These two kinds of biology display very different
commitments to the causal structure of the objects that they study.
1.3 Simple versus Complex Abstraction
The second distinction concerns our categorization of concrete objects in
the world into, what I will call, "theoretical kinds" at ever-increasing levels of
generality. Here the important criterion of categorization is judged similarity of
objects. When objects are judged similar in many important respects, then they
are considered instances of the same theoretical kind.
In this section, I motivate my account of abstraction by first describing the
tool, intensional sets with properties. I defend my tool by placing it in the context
of some philosophical theories, many of which are explicitly or implicitly
compatible with my account of abstraction. I then articulate how my account

works both in formal and compositional biology both in general and with
examples.
 In analytical philosophy, there is a classic distinction between intension
and extension.14 The intension of a term is the set of properties or sentences
providing the "meaning" that is used to identify the concrete objects to which the
term, or kind, pertains. I argue for a general account of intensional sets in which
they contain the properties (or "predicates") used to define the term or kind. It is
difficult to atomize and count properties and predicates, but again, following my
naturalistic analysis, I place the brunt of the identification work on the scientific
theory and its choice of properties (including, for example, causal factors).15 The
extension of a term consists of all the concrete objects referred to by the term. The
smaller the intensional set, and thereby the larger the extension (since more
objects are picked out under less constrained intensions), the more abstract the
theoretical kind. Thus two theoretical kinds, one more abstract, and sometimes
including, the more concrete one, have different relative sizes of intensional sets
(former smaller than latter) and extensions (former larger than latter).
Intensional sets provide the means for diagnosis and recognition of
theoretical kinds in this world, as the traditional theory of meaning also holds.
The intensional set then determines the appropriate reference and extension of
                                                  
14 E.g., Lewis 1946, p. 39. In a very similar distinction, Frege distinguished
between two senses of meaning: connotation and denotation.
15 Furthermore, many philosophers of science also do not have good a priori
accounts of property identification. For example, Cartwright 1989 simply
assumes, as we shall see below, that abstract categories contain fewer properties
or Aristotelian causes than more concrete categories. Furthermore, van Fraassen
1967, while discussing meaning relations among predicates, does not anywhere
provide an account of predicate identification. Given the naturalistic and
empiricist tendencies of these two philosophers, I believe that they too would
turn to the scientific theory for providing an anatomy of the pertinent property
structure.

the term. There are a variety of views under this traditional theory ranging from
the idea of "necessary and sufficient conditions" for adequate reference of an
object by a term, advocated by philosophers like John Locke and C. I. Lewis, to
the idea, defended by Wittgenstein and Boyd that terms have neither necessary
conditions, nor sets of sufficient conditions, to refer correctly to an object.16
Before I further explicate this traditional theory of meaning, I want to
contrast it with what another theory of meaning, the Kripke-Putnam causal
theory of reference.17 This view holds that terms function more like proper names
that rigidly designate a single individual (e.g., "Aristotle," "Ayers Rock"18) than
like natural kind terms where degree of similarity in properties among objects is
used to appropriately class the objects (the traditional theory of meaning). Under
the Kripke-Putnam view, a single baptismal event ("water is what I have here,
H2O") determines the subsequent appropriate usage of that term. They
emphasize the baptismal event and subsequent historical chain of usage of the
term and leave out the epistemic events of judging particular objects as instances
(or not) of particular kinds.
Since Kripke and Putnam use proper names as their model for terms (which
are, by definition, for one object – the individual), rather than kinds (of many
objects), their account does not handle terms well that refer to kinds of objects.
For kinds, epistemic acts of judgment of similarity and instantiation determining
adequacy of reference to an object are absolutely crucial. That is, the historical
chain of term use is not sufficient. We still have to determine whether a

particular object can be considered an instance of a kind. This we can do in a
number of ways: (1) compare it to a concrete prototype, (2) abstract properties
from the object and compare quantity and quality of property similarity to the
intensional set of the abstract kind, or (3) judge, qualitatively, overall similarity
with the kind and, if very similar, determine from that what properties the object
and kind share.19 My point is that whichever way we choose epistemically or
psychologically, or champion in philosophical argument, each of these ways can
be represented—rationally reconstructed—in terms of comparison of the
contents of the intensional sets of the concrete object and the kind term. The
traditional, rather than the Kripke-Putnam, theory of meaning should be used in
evaluating the proper use, in science, of theoretical kinds.
One concern Kripke and Putnam have vis-à-vis the traditional theory of
meaning is that a particular individual does not maintain its properties across
possible worlds, although it is still the same individual. They use this as an
argument in favor of their view that what provides the meaning of a term is the
baptismal event of naming, and subsequent accurate reference (which, as I
argued above will always rely on epistemic acts of judgment). To this, I argue
that it is less important to worry about identity and reference maintenance across
possible worlds, than to be concerned with accurate scientific judgment and
                                                  
19 Regarding the third option, one could further say that what is important here is
to determine what tropes (or kinds of predicates/predicate universals, such as
"redness" or "tallness") are both instantiated in the object and captured by the
kind (cf. Lowe 1988). Identifying this will allow us to compare property, that is,
predicate, sharing between object and kind. With respect to the first two, object
identification or concept formation as occurring through either comparison with
a concrete prototype or through the establishment of property similarity with an
abstract kind, see Rosch and Mervis 1975; Rosch et al. 1976; Medin et al. 2000. I
thank Frederick Schmitt for pointing me to this literature.

identification of theoretical kinds in this world. And here we must rely on
property sharing of some sort.
Kripke and Putnam, following Quine20, argue that ultimately the
baptismal event can be shown to be "accurate" and consistent based on the
microstructure of the object. That is, water is H2O not only because that was the
baptismal event in the past, based, partly at least, on superficial properties, but
also, more importantly, because we eventually discovered the microstructure of
water and were able to provide scientific criteria for differentiating water from
non-water (even in cases, Kripke and Putnam argue, where non-water resembled
water in all observable, but not essential properties).
Now, I do not believe that one has to adopt a Kripke-Putnam theory of
meaning to endorse a view that knowledge of the microstructure is an important
criterion for identifying an object as an instance of a kind. Some properties may
be necessary for an object to be an instance of a kind (e.g., in order to be a piece of
matter, the piece must have some mass, even if it is non-resting mass).  And some
of these properties are determined by the microstructure of the object.
Furthermore, it is true that often properties covary in the intensional sets of
particular terms (e.g., charge and acceleration, given particular conditions,
covary for all electrical charges); this is precisely what laws and generalizations
attempt to capture. And property correlations often have to do with the
microstructure, including the causal structure, of the objects involved, as studied
by that theory. None of this need involve a Kripke-Putnam style causal theory of
meaning. In fact, I gladly endorse the view, agnostic with respect to realism, that
                                                  
20 See, for example, Quine 1991 (1969), pp. 169-170.

theoretical kinds and properties can be highly projectible21 because of (a
combination of) microstructure and theoretical richness.
In short, then, the Kripke-Putnam theory of meaning underestimates the
role of epistemic judgments of similarity, overemphasizes the importance of
possible world ontology, and has too narrow an interpretation on the importance
of microstructure. I will now turn to the traditional theory of meaning and two
very different presentations of it: the traditional Locke-Lewis "necessary and
sufficient condition" abstraction, which I call "simple abstraction," and the
Wittgenstein-Boyd "family resemblance" abstraction, which I call "complex
abstraction." I claim that the former is especially pertinent to formal biology,
while the latter is crucial for compositional biology. But first I must sketch my
general view on abstraction.
I employ a version of Cartwright's definition of abstraction as the removal
of either properties or Aristotelian causes.22 Concerning the first, Cartwright
notes that there is some difficulty in knowing exactly how to individuate
properties, but that we still acquire a good intuitive idea of abstraction by
thinking of it in its Aristotelian and etymological sense of "taking away,"
"separating," and "subtracting."23 She writes,
For Aristotle we begin with a concrete particular complete with all
its properties. We then strip away—in our imagination—all that is
                                                  
21 See Goodman 1983 on projectibility of theoretical kinds and properties, that is,
the reliability of inferences regarding the membership in a particular kind as well
as ownership of particular properties, by objects thus far unobserved, made on
the basis of (1) observed objects and (2) judged similarity between the
unobserved and observed objects. See also Barker 1997 who discusses the general
issue of "ampliative inference."

irrelevant to the concerns of the moment to focus on some single
property or set of properties, 'as if they were separate.'24
To paraphrase, we remove elements (properties) from the intensional set of the
theoretical kind. A formally similar argument applies to Cartwright's more
concrete account of abstraction through subtraction of Aristotelian causes. The
main difference is that here the properties are collected into each of the four
Aristotelian causes and then removed as a group, a cause at a time (i.e., material,
efficient, formal and final). This very general account of abstraction holds for
both simple and complex abstraction.
Cartwright claims that more "explanatory information" is provided when
more of the Aristotelian causes are present in the "object," or what I believe can
be read as "theoretical kind."25 One advantage of the "Aristotelian causes" version
of abstraction over the property version is that it provides a useful typology of
the (sets of) properties that are removed. But the more general property account
of abstraction can be implemented with my intensional set analysis.
A very similar account of abstraction was presented by the important
American evolutionist James Mark Baldwin, together with an English
psychologically-inclined philosopher, George Frederick Stout, in Baldwin's
Dictionary of Psychology and Philosophy from 1903. They defined abstraction as
"Concentration of attention on those parts or characters of an object which are
treated as relevant to the special interest of the moment, and its consequent
withdrawal from those which are irrelevant."26 It is worth noting that Baldwin
and Stout also mentioned the "parts" of an object. Below I shall explore the

problematic notion of partitioning as a form of abstraction. For now, it is best to
consider abstraction merely as the removal of properties.
In Chapters 4 and 5, I will compare Cartwright and Friedman on various
points, including the role they believe that abstract laws and models play, and
their distinct views on explanation. Here I want to distinguish two aspects of my
account of abstraction, inspired by Cartwright's notion of the abstract-to-concrete
relation as one of few-to-many properties and Aristotelian causes. There is a
distinction to be made between the overall pattern of abstraction and the purpose
of abstraction. The overall pattern I argue for is one of property removal. As we
shall see in Chapter 5, Friedman has an incremental theory of abstraction, which I
do not endorse, although it is interesting, because I am not sure that it
individuates kinds, in addition to laws and models, correctly. But an important
point that Friedman's analysis reminds us of is that abstraction, in general27, is for
the purpose of creativity – new connections and hypotheses can be articulated.28
                                                  
27 Of laws and models, and not just of terms.
28 In a footnote discussing Whewell's notion of consilience, Friedman notes that
"the whole point of theoretical structure is to facilitate this process of inductive
'jumping together'." (Friedman 1983, p. 242) In the literary sphere, Jorge Luis
Borges makes an analogous point in an essay entitled "Kafka and His
Precursors": "If I am not mistaken, the heterogeneous pieces I have enumerated
resemble Kafka; if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other
[Wittgenstein's family resemblance!]. This second fact is the more significant. In
each of these texts we find Kafka's idiosyncrasy to a greater or lesser degree, but
if Kafka had never written a line, we would not perceive this quality; in other
words it would not exist. … The fact is that every writer creates his own
precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, [just as it has to]
modify the future." (Borges 1964, p. 201; cf. Borges 1970 writes "como ha de
modificar el futuro") For Borges, Kafka created a new way to tie together
disparate work by authors such as Kierkegård and Browning – this is, in a loose
sense, analogous to creating new connections and hypotheses through the use of
an abstract theoretical kind, law or model. McOuat 2001 also indirectly relates to
the point of kinds providing the grounds for creative model construction,
broadly construed. He also directly tackles the relationship between kind/model
construction and kind/model evaluation, through measurement.

A removal view of abstraction can easily imply lack of creativity, although this is
not something that I think Cartwright endorses29. I certainly endorse a removal
pattern and a creative role for abstraction, certainly in formal biology. Abstract
theoretical kinds (e.g., "charged particle," "gene with only fitness parameter")
often serve unifying and organizing purposes in the laws and models of the
theory at hand.
Let me now turn to two extreme presentations of the traditional theory of
meaning: Locke-Lewis "necessary and sufficient condition" abstraction and
Wittgenstein-Boyd "family resemblance" abstraction. In his An Essay Concerning
Human Understanding, Locke adopted a nominalist position – he held that (kind)
terms did not refer to essences, but were rather "the Workmanship of the
Understanding."30 What is important for my argument is his view that names, at
every level of abstraction, are necessarily associated with a collection of ideas. In
discussing the "Ring on [his] Finger," he makes a distinction between its real
essence31 and its nominal essence. The latter, which we can, and do, know "is its
Colour, Weight, Fusibility, Fixedness, etc. which makes it to be Gold, or gives it a
right to that Name."32 Thus, for Locke a name (the nominal essence; e.g., "Gold")
is captured in the properties defining it (e.g., its particular "Colour, Weight,
Fusibility, Fixedness"). Lewis makes a similar point when he writes,

29 For example, in "The Truth Doesn't Explain Much" she notes that abstract laws
"unify" and "organize." This seems to grant them a creative role in generating
new more concrete laws and models even if abstract laws are false and do not
organize "varied and diverse" phenomena (Cartwright 1983, p. 53).

essence of the thing named."33 Lewis is very clear throughout his discussion of
intension and extension that a kind term has necessary and sufficient properties
– the attributes are "required." Neither Locke nor Lewis, however, have a clear
dynamical account of the process or even pattern of abstraction. Furthermore, their
account concerns the nature of vernacular terms and they do not discuss
scientific terms. Despite these weaknesses, their account of (theoretical) kind
terms as containing necessary and sufficient conditions provides a good start for
my account of simple abstraction using intensional sets.
When theoretical kinds are judged, and abstracted, on simple objects,
intensional sets with necessary and sufficient properties can often be found –
simple abstraction can be done. Therefore, the intensional sets of theoretical
kinds of simple objects have a neat overlapping structure. That is, there is only
one way to abstract a more concrete theoretical kind to the immediately more
abstract theoretical kind, defined by a particular intensional set of necessary and
sufficient conditions for that more abstract theoretical kind; this way is to remove
just the one right property. If we keep on doing this, we will see a neat
overlapping structure of the properties of the intensional sets of progressively
more abstracted theoretical kinds. We see this neat structure in simple objects
because all objects of a particular simple kind are equivalent and objects of
another simple kind, which can be placed together with the objects of the original
ontological kind under a more abstract theoretical kind, are also equivalent.
For example, leptons, which include electrons and muons, are
fundamental particles with no strong force interactions. All electrons have a

particular mass (.000511 GeV/c 2) and charge (-1e); all muons also have a
particular mass (.106 GeV/c 2) and charge (-1e).34 Each of these simple kinds can
be judged similar theoretically using just the mass, which is a necessary property;
however, it may not be sufficient (some particle in the universe may just happen
to have that same mass and not be an electron). However, if we add "charge" and
"fundamental particle with no strong force interactions" to our intensional set,
then we have a robust intensional set with necessary and sufficient properties for
the theoretical kind, whether it be an "electron" or a "muon." Now, we can
produce an even more abstract theoretical (simple) kind by ignoring mass and
charge and simply saying "a fundamental particle with no strong force
interactions" – this is the definition of the theoretical kind "lepton" (it is not
important for purposes of this argument that "fundamental particle" and "strong
force interaction" are themselves theoretical kinds and simple objects,
respectively – these kinds are defined independently). Note that the extension of
the "electron" theoretical kind is identical to all the simple kind electrons out
there; the extension of the lepton theoretical kind is the sum of the electron,
muon, and four other fundamental particle simple kinds in the world.
After giving this scientific example of abstraction into theoretical kinds, let
me turn briefly to mathematical abstraction, which I consider a special case of
abstraction using intensional sets. To the best of my current knowledge, there is
not much literature on the act of abstracting an object (e.g., "evolutionary gene")
or equation (e.g., "gene frequency change based on selection and drift")

mathematically.35 Various forces, under particular background conditions (to be
further discussed below under the name "ceteris paribus intensional set") are
assigned to objects in the form of properties defined by those forces.
Formal biology, best represented in mathematical evolutionary genetics,
appeals and employs simple mathematical abstraction. Although there is a
diversity of mathematical models in evolutionary genetics, the genetic
parameters and variables, and formulas followed, are basically agreed upon and
neat hierarchies of mathematical kinds and formulas representing various
numbers of genetic parameters and variables are developed in the model
hierarchies for a particular problem areas under a particular set of assumptions.36
                                                  
35 Steiner 1989 does discuss related matters, but he does not focus on the actual
process of abstracting mathematical properties from object properties, or from
producing an abstraction hierarchy of such mathematical properties, both of
which are my concern here.
36 Lloyd argues that the view of evolutionary (genetic) theory as hierarchical
applies primarily to the very abstract high-level theory of evolution, but not to the
much more concrete "theoretical models" "which are formed from specific
theories through the adoption of additional empirical assumptions." (Lloyd 1988,
p. 13) For example, consider the point that both Fisherian and Wrightian
mathematical modeling schools agree on the basic (abstract!) formulas and forces
of evolution, formally considered (Michael Wade, pers. comm.). Lloyd thus
suggests that neat hierarchy exists at very abstract high levels of evolutionary
theory, but not at the low-level (e.g., theoretical models) and the middle-level
(e.g., model-types). In fact, Lloyd's philosophical analysis of the units of selection
controversy (e.g., Lloyd 1988, 2000a) shows, convincingly, the mismatches in
empirical assumptions and theoretical goals between different theoretical models
and model types of "group selection" and, thus, the absence of a consensus neat
model hierarchy. But, underlying this diversity, there does seem to be a
mathematical ideal imperative toward—and, to an extent, an actual situation
of—theoretical unification as has been shown in recent work showing the
mathematical translatability of different parameterizations of group and
individual selection (Dugatkin and Reeve 1994; Kerr and Godfrey-Smith 2002a,
2002b) as well as earlier work on the unificatory power of the Price covariance
approach (Wade 1985; Frank 1997), to be further discussed in Chapter 5. It is
unclear to how low a level of model abstraction these unification attempts
pertain. Furthermore, however, it is clear, and Lloyd does show this, that within a
set (family) of assumptions and modeling techniques, there is a fairly neat
abstraction hierarchy of models.

In fact, the simple theoretical kinds employed in these mathematical models have
necessary and sufficient properties by definition.37 Such simple abstraction of
these theoretical kinds (genes) and formulas is an aspect of the clear and definite
logic of mathematical abstraction (by removal of parameters and variables). That
is, mathematical properties for a gene represented by parameters and variables,
postulate, that is, theoretically define properties for the model-based gene that
are then measured in the empirical gene (e.g., fitness effect and mutation rate of a
gene is defined, represented in models, and then, sometimes, measured).38
I will now turn to complex abstraction as advocated by Wittgenstein and
Boyd, which I argue is prevalent in compositional biology. In his Philosophical
Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that terms could not be presented in terms of
intensional sets of necessary and sufficient conditions, but should rather be
thought of as having (something like) disjunct sets of properties. That is, the
objects (extension) referred to by a particular term do not all share the same
properties; an object may share property X with another object, while sharing
property Z with a third object. In discussing how one determines "kinship"
between different images, he writes,
In such a difficulty always ask yourself: How did we learn the
meaning of the word ("good" for instance) From what sort of
examples? in what language-games? Then it will be easier for you
to see that the word must have a family of meanings.39
Terms have a "family of meanings" that are learned by ostension and by the
appropriate use of language. I interpret this as Wittgenstein arguing that the
connotation of terms is constituted by a multiplicity of intensional sets.
                                                  
37 This is certainly not the case in compositional biology.
38 I will return to mathematical abstraction in the next section, on models, of this
chapter.

Boyd accounts for the meaning of theoretical kinds by appealing to what
he calls "homeostatic property clusters."40 Instances of theoretical kinds, Boyd
argues, tend to have some, but not all, properties (and values of those
properties), to a large extent, in common. Furthermore, Boyd claims, they have
this homeostatic cluster of properties in common because these properties are
projectible to unobserved instances of the kind, under the particular theory
under discussion. Boyd is also a realist. He claims that the properties provide an
accurate classification when they accommodate the causal structures postulated by
the theory.41 It is under these conditions that the kinds can serve in our inductive
and explanatory practices. Boyd claims that the correlation between the
properties need not be causal (either through mutual interaction or common
cause), but given his realist commitments to kinds, entities, and causes it is
difficult to see under what conditions the cluster properties would not be
causally interwoven. For example, his paradigm case of homeostatic property
clusters is species and the members/instances of species have similar properties
precisely because of (1) a common cause, genealogy, and, (2) maintenance of
character cohesion through gene exchange of members of that species.42
                                                  
40 See, e.g., Boyd 1991, 1999.
41 Boyd 1999, especially pp. 146-148, 165-167, 176-179.
42 Note that Boyd's, as well as Wittgenstein's, account of natural kinds, does not
fit well with the received view of kinds and Laws, which includes the "necessary
and sufficient view" of abstraction as well as the Law-based view favored by
many of the logical positivists, to be further explored in Chapters 4 and 5, and
also in Appendix A. First of all, predictions and explanations are fallible because
the projectibility of any given property is not perfect across instances (there are
no necessary conditions for all instances of a particular kind), nor is it perfect into
the future because Boyd allows for the possibility of change in the causal
explanations pertinent to particular kinds (for example, the way a liver works in
an ancestor could be different from the way it works in a descendant).  Boyd thus
allows for predictive imperfections as well as Laws (or, more aptly put, loose
correlations or mechanisms) that change over time.

34
Furthermore, he does not believe in the reduction of properties to some sort of
intrinsic microstructure or essence, which can ultimately be represented in
powerful (formal) laws. Homeostatic property clusters are complex and cannot
be reduced further. Thus, the received view of necessary and sufficient
properties for natural kinds seems at philosophical odds with Wittgenstein's
family resemblance and Boyd's homeostatic property cluster views. I will now
place my articulation of theoretical kinds and abstraction in the context of this
debate.
When theoretical kinds are judged, and abstracted, on complex objects,
necessary and sufficient properties cannot often be found. We can still talk about
the intensional sets of such theoretical kinds, but now the intensional sets for the
same theoretical kind will be malleable – that is, multiple intensional sets will
correspond to the same theoretical kind. 43 Properties in these intensional sets of a
theoretical kind will sometimes not be causally correlated with one another, and
they will certainly not be neatly related to a more abstract theoretical kind by
subtraction of the same properties from the different intensional sets that give
the same more concrete theoretical kind.44 That is, there will be more than one
way to get to the same more abstract theoretical kind. Put differently, for
complex objects, especially the parts of a system investigated by compositional
                                                  
43 As a general example consider the fact that there are multiple types of
pathologies for almost every organ of the human body. And in many cases,
humans still manage to live satisfactory extended lives with these pathologies.
The pathological organ of a human organism does not have the same set of
properties as that for the "ideal" or "normal" organ. And yet we would refer to it
as an instance of the same theoretical kind – we would call it, for example, a
human liver or, more abstractly, a mammalian liver. Furthermore, there are also
many non-pathological variations in function type and magnitude.
44 Eco 1984 made this point in criticizing the single-branching structure in the
Porphyric Tree of ever more concrete concepts.

biology, there are often properties that are important to the definition of
particular theoretical kinds and adequate reference to objects, but few, if any,
properties are genuinely necessary and few sets of properties are genuinely
sufficient for all the objects of a particular theoretical kind. For example, "heart"
can be defined in many ways, depending on the theory used, the taxa studied,
and the level of generality desired. Even for a particular clade (e.g., mammalian)
there are not really any necessary and sufficient conditions for defining "heart" –
exceptions can almost always be found, and "hearts" are not equivalent to one
another.
A complex object can often be analyzed from very different theories, as I
will explore in Chapter 2 where I also develop the idea of "theoretical
perspectives." Thus, there are multiple possible kinds of abstraction hierarchies,
since there are very different ways of formulating theoretical kinds. In organismal
biology, for example, comparative anatomy, developmental biology and
physiology provide distinct ways of defining, recognizing, and explaining
theoretical kinds. Each of these ways involves distinct theoretical kinds many of
which are not translatable across perspectives, in the members of their intensional
sets, since the properties are so qualitatively different. Of course, a variety of
perspectives exist in theoretical physics as well, but there phenomena tend to be
of one kind or another (e.g., gravitational or electromagnetic) and there is often a
clearly best way to analyze any object or process (i.e., simple object), thus
theories do not tend to overlap and provide distinct relevant explanations for the
same object. Furthermore, in theoretical physics, theories, many of which can be
related to basic forces, apply either to very distinct levels of nature (e.g., classical

Chapter 1

36
mechanics vs. quantum mechanics) or, more importantly, can often be unified45
to a single theoretical perspective (e.g., quantum electrodynamics and, now,
superstring theory).
In theoretical physics, and, on analogy, in formal biology, a few basic
properties are considered important and can often be translated across theories;
furthermore, there are clear ways of integrating perspectives either through
abstraction (theoretical unification of forces) or through theoretical interrelation
(addition of forces of different types in a "vectorial" fashion in a particular
situation). Theoretical physics and compositional biology (but not formal
biology!) differ in that the former tends to deal with simple objects and the latter
with complex objects. But they also differ in that the variety of theories in
compositional biology has real potency and can be interpreted to lead to its
disunity, as I will explore in Chapters 2 and 3, whereas the variety in physics can
be mostly overcome through abstraction and/or interrelation.
Now that we have discussed some of the differences between simple
abstraction, often on simple objects, and complex abstraction, often on complex
objects, let us develop a formalism for the concept of necessary and sufficient
properties as well as the denial of this concept.46 This will allow us to clarify the
above discussion, and present it in a different manner. Note that a particular
theoretical kind, TK, (supported by a theory) is defined by an intensional set
consisting of a variety of properties, P. Objects are partly determined by a theory
(e.g., the additive or interactive effects of genes are interpreted differently in
Fisherian or Wrightian population genetics; the developmental liver is not

Friedman's view, in Chapter 5.

equivalent in all respects to the physiological liver). This, however, does not
affect the formalism. It only implies that the list of objects changes as theories are
changed.
The following implies that we accept the existence of at least one property
necessary for instantiation of a theoretical kind:
"SO"TK($PI)[(SOeTK) Æ SO(PI)]
[1.1]
[Note: SO = "simple object"; "SOeTK" should be read as, "SO is an instance
of TK"; " SO(PI)" should be read as, "SO has property PI." The variables are
intended to hold for all simple objects, all theoretical kinds, and all
properties, under particular theories (which, themselves determine the
theoretical kind).]
An example of this would be SO: electrons, P: electron charge
The following implies that we accept the existence of at least one property
sufficient for instantiation of a theoretical kind:
"SO"TK($PI)[SO(PI) Æ (SOeTK)]
[1.2]
It may be difficult to find examples for sufficiency of just one property,
but we can extend the formalism by introducing sufficient sets of properties:
"SO"TK($PI)[SO(PILPLL…) Æ (SOeTK)]
[1.3]
An example of this might be SO: electrons, P: electron charge, electron mass,
fundamental particle with no strong force interaction.

Chapter 1

38
Note that for complex objects, in general, the above sentences would all be
false. That is, we would deny necessity and sufficiency of properties (or property
sets) for instantiation (and determination of the extensional set) of complex
objects of particular theoretical kinds. This would be represented formally by
adding a negation (ÿ) in front of each existential quantifier and also replacing all
the SOs with COs (i.e., "complex objects").
Introducing sets of properties brings up the possibility of introducing
disjunctions of properties and sets of properties. For example, a Wittgensteinian
would concede the necessity of a sufficiently long property disjunctive list in [1]
above [i.e., replace " SO(PI)" with "CO(PIVPLV…)"]. With the disjunction of PI's
sufficiently long, the Wittgensteinian would have to agree that the disjunction is
necessary. Of course, she could claim that it would have to be infinitely long, or
at least as long as there are members in the extensional set, and that such a "save"
misses her point.
Interesting cases arise in the epistemic area between simple objects and
complex objects. As we move from complex objects to simple objects, the
disjunction list gets shorter and shorter (the limit being one property). Consider
elements of the same chemical group. They share many properties, yet they vary
in some as well. There a disjunction list longer than one, but not much longer,
would capture the necessary set of properties to be an object of that group. Such
a case would be intermediary between, say, hadrons (all of which share the crucial
property of being affected by the strong force, which leads to many other similar
properties) and kidneys of humans (which share some properties, especially
high-level functional ones, but are extremely variable and have all kinds of

Chapter 1

39
mal/misfunctions; these mal/misfunctions can be represented as distinct
properties).
The general point here is that we can almost always abstract using
necessary and sufficient properties—simple abstraction—in the case of simple
objects, whereas complex abstraction is almost always required for complex
objects. However, there is a middle ground with short disjunctions of necessary
sets of properties.
These arguments regarding theoretical kinds can be summarized in the
following table, which captures the different characteristics of the intensional set
defining and abstracting the two extreme form of objects given or postulated by
theory. Note that the middle ground of objects is not depicted in this table, but its
characteristics would be between the answers in either column.

47 Note that I want to remain agnostic about the realism issue with respect to the
objects of the theory. The two distinctions I have thus far presented—the causal
structure of the objects and the abstraction of objects into kinds—are highly
theory-dependent, but the first concerns the putative causal structure of the entities
prescribed by our theories while the latter focuses on the epistemic categorization
of those entities into hierarchical groups captured by similarity.
48 Two different (but not distinct!) intensional sets to pick out, say Calcium,
would be equivalent because the different properties they employ (e.g.,
ionization energy and atomic number) are causally correlated.
49 Developmental homology ≠ structural homology. That is, developmental
criteria do not pick out the same spatio-temporal regions as structural criteria,
yet both can be used to pick out, say, mammalian hearts. Another example is
Wittgenstein's famous example of games.

Thus far, I have spoken about the nature of the intensional set that
determines the theoretical kind, at a particular level of generality, under study.
What I want to introduce now is a concept that I will call the "background" or
"ceteris paribus properties" of this intensional set. The basic idea here is that the
utility—appropriateness of reference and projectibility—of the theoretical kind
depends on what the other properties ascribed to the theoretical kind are. That is,
what other assumptions are made about the theoretical kind and how reliable are
the inferences licensed by these assumptions about properties?
One argument is that while abstraction can proceed mostly problem-free
in theoretical physics and formal biology, and is, in fact, one of the goals and
generalizing principles of those kinds of sciences, abstraction is highly limited in
use in compositional biology. There generalizations about the causal role of parts
are much more context-dependent and subject to exceptions – even when the
"foreground" properties of the intensional set are met in complex abstraction, the
background properties can fail to be met in many different ways.
For example, consider ideal gases and the simple and formal relationships
captured by the ideal gas law. We can define a very abstract theoretical kind—an
ideal gas—with a very broad extension. Of course, the realism of this abstraction
is not always very high. In fact, and this is a general point, the realism of this
theoretical kind only applies under a particular ceteris paribus clause, which can
be captured in the intensional set (e.g., the gas should have the properties of not
being subject to any kinds of intermolecular forces, of not being subject to
magnetic fields present for gas molecules with the property of having a magnetic
moment, etc.). This clause can thus be thought of as part of the intensional set
defining the kind, but it is the background of this set. It is the background in two

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
42
senses: (1) it is usually covert and (2) it provides the context in which the relevant
properties of intensional set accurately capture the right extension (it "fills in" the
properties not mentioned in the definition). When this clause holds, the
theoretical kind (e.g., ideal gas) accurately captures all the relevant properties of
the objects under its extension. When the clause does not hold, and it often does
not, to varying degrees, then the theoretical kind misses some of the (causally)
relevant properties and is, therefore, not realistic. But the intensional set of the
theoretical kind still captures the important properties of an abstract and
explanatorily potent theoretical kind, which, as we shall see in Chapter 5 when
discussing Friedman's view, can allow us to derive more concrete laws, models,
and theoretical kinds.
For theoretical physics and formal biology the background part of the
intensional set is much more flexible and significantly smaller than the part for
compositional biology. That is, often even when one or more of the elements of
the background does not hold (i.e., does not describe the situation at hand – the
theoretical kind does not apply, strictly speaking, to the particular object), the
theoretical kind still captures many relevant and causally important properties of
the object. To a significant first approximation, the kind is still applicable. This is
the "flexibility" of the clause. Furthermore, there are fewer meaningful ways in
which the ceteris paribus clause can fail to be met when applied to the simple
objects of theoretical physics and formal biology. Since these kinds are causally
simple, there are fewer, different in type, ways for the causal context to be
different, and, thus, for defining the theoretical kind differently. For example, the
orbits of the planets of the solar system can, with great accuracy, be predicted
from the set of pairwise interactions between each planet and the Sun. One can

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
43
think of these pairwise interactions between point masses, captured by the
Universal Law of Gravitation, as a theoretical kind. Of course, the gravitational
force of the other planets and even of close stars should be taken into account
(i.e., the ceteris paribus clause of a pairwise interaction does not, strictly speaking,
hold), but the orbit can still be calculated with great accuracy from just pairwise
interactions. Furthermore, given that the primary force acting on the earth is
gravity, there are few ways different in kind in which the clause can be
inapplicable (e.g., electromagnetic and other forces are not relevant).
This picture of theoretical kinds with the background members of their
intensional sets helping to specify the context in which they apply, also pertains
to compositional biology. But here the background components are often
falsified, both in number and kind of properties and conditions.  Due to the
causal complexity of parts, there are so many conditions that need to be met for a
particular part—complex object—to "count as" an instance of a theoretical kind.
If any of these are missing (e.g., a liver not engaging in the right kinds of
mechanisms), then that complex individual would not, strictly speaking or even
usefully speaking, count as an object of that complex theoretical kind (e.g., it
would be a pathological liver). And there are many ways, both within and across
types of ways, for a complex object not to match the prescriptions of the ceteris
paribus clause of its putative abstract theoretical kind. For example, consider the
lack of predictive power that inferences about gene function often have across
different taxa. We can establish similarity of gene sequence and thereby define a
particular gene type. But, the concretization of this gene in particular systems50 is
such that whatever properties could be ignored in the source system from which
                                                  
50 Note the explicit consideration of part-whole relationships here.

Chapter 1

44
the gene, and its causal roles, were abstracted, cannot now be ignored in the
target systems. Different properties and kinds of properties come to the fore, and
the ceteris paribus clause in the intensional set does not hold. The complexity of
the causal networks in which genes are involved are such that inferences made
on the basis of abstract theoretical gene types are extremely problematic and
fallible.51
A further difference between the two kinds of biology becomes clear when
one considers reactions to failures of the ceteris paribus clause and the subsequent
accuracy of abstract theoretical kinds. Two sorts of responses are available, one
employing theoretical activity, the other using empirical manipulation.52 (1) With
respect to theoretical activity, the appropriate response to a situation with a new
force or a new complication is to add formula variables (which can be thought of
properties as in the intensional set pertinent to that object) that take that into
account. For example, in the ideal gas laws we can add van der Waal forces when
they become pertinent. There are precise and well-defined ways to add forces to
specify the properties of the more concrete theoretical kinds of theoretical
physics and formal biology.53 In compositional biology, there are not well-
                                                  
51 Again, note that such inferences are much less problematic in the case of kind-
based sciences in which subsumption of abstract theoretical kinds is much more
straightforward, certain and useful.
52 For more detail on the distinction between theoretical and empirical activity,
which is not the same as the distinction between theoretical and empirical
content (!), see Chapter 4.
53 In a chapter entitled "Physical Law," Duhem 1977 explicitly considers laws
under increasingly complex and realistic conditions. Under such conditions, he
explains how variables can be incrementally added to the symbolic relations that
constitute laws in his opinion. A similar argument can be made for theoretical
kinds considered as mathematical kinds. Consider a point mass in a problem
involving only gravity. Now imagine that a collision with another massive object
occurs. Then this is a particular kind of point mass whose properties
(acceleration) can be precisely derived from combining gravitational and impact

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
45
defined ways for further specification of theoretical kinds. If a ceteris paribus
clause should not be met, it is unclear how to theoretically model, or explain or
predict concrete situations that fail to meet the background properties. At least
one reason for this is because causes often interact in causal, non-quantitative,
and non-predictable ways in compositional biology. So removing or adding a
causal factor from the intensional set describing a theoretical kind cannot be
interpreted in the additive "vectorial" fashion that it often can in formal biology.
(2) With respect to empirical manipulation, failures of the ceteris paribus
clause in theoretical physics can be remedied by controlling the factor and,
thereby, reinstating the ceteris paribus clause. That is, if for example a magnetic
field causes the deviation of some magnetically inducible gas from the ideal gas
law, then simply turning off or neutralizing the magnetic field can control the
situation. Of course this is not always possible, but often it is. This is more
difficult, however, to do in formal biology. However, there are methods of
statistical randomizing effects in the populations pertinent to ecological or
evolutionary genetic studies, for example. In compositional biology, however, it
is very difficult to control for factors in part because the system is so intimately
integrated that trying to control it might cause the whole system to malfunction
and even if it still functions, the outcome of a control might not be the same
outcome as the outcome that actually exists in the system naturally.
The utility of very abstract theoretical kinds (in part determined by the
realistic applicability of that kind) is high in theoretical physics and formal
biology, but rather low in compositional biology.

acceleration ("a") of this kind ("m").

In this section on abstraction, I hope to have motivated and sketched a
general account of abstraction. I am inspired by Cartwright's version of
abstraction as removal of properties; but, as Friedman (and Borges), among
others, reminds us, abstraction is a creative process, so we must remember that
removal of properties can also be creative. My general account of abstraction
relies on the notion of an intensional set with properties pertinent to a theoretical
kind as members. Abstraction, then, is removal of properties from this set. This
can happen in a neat and hierarchical fashion, as is the case with simple
abstraction on simple objects in formal biology. Or it can happen in a much
messier and non-overlapping fashion, as is the case with complex abstraction on
complex objects in compositional biology. The intensional set can be construed as
being very large, including all kinds of properties determined by the theory,
including properties that allow for the idealization of the theoretical kind.  The
properties that are commonly used in the explicit definition of the theoretical kind
I consider the foreground properties. The ones that allow for this theoretical kind
to be useful and stable, I call the background properties in the ceteris paribus
clause. The background properties are much more easily controlled and
understood in formal biology than in compositional biology. In short, abstraction
is much clearer and more powerful in formal biology, although it is certainly
present (although more fallible) in compositional biology.

1.4 Mathematical Models versus Propositional Non-Mathematical or Material
Models
The third distinction concerns modeling, which is a crucial part of
scientific work. In Chapter 4, I will analyze the concept of models and modeling
in detail. Here I want to contrast, in a basic manner, mathematical to
propositional non-mathematical or material models. I argue that formal biology
tends to employ mathematical models, whereas compositional biology generally
uses the other two general model forms. In this chapter, I will not analyze the
semantic view, or expansive/deflationary views of it, or even orthogonal
approaches – I leave that for Chapter 4.54 In that chapter, I argue that modeling is
a theoretical activity, although it certainly has significant empirical content. There
I also develop a framework describing four general properties of models
possessed by all the model forms employed in biology. Thus I postpone an
important argument for the idea that non-propositional models (e.g., narrative
and diagrammatic models) and material models (e.g., scale models and
Griesemer's "remnant models") are indeed models. In this current section, I
motivate how modeling, and the model forms employed, in each kind of biology
are related to other methods and assumptions (captured by my other three
distinctions). I am interested in how, rather than what, models represent.
                                                  
54 Proponents of the semantic view of theories include Lloyd, Suppe, Suppes,
Thompson, and van Fraassen. Both Griesemer and Downes can be thought of as
adopting some aspects of the view, while remaining skeptical about other
features of it. Advocates of orthogonal approaches on models and modeling
include Cartwright, Friedman, Morgan, Morrison, and Suárez.

I will first explore mathematical models, commonly found in formal
biology, and will then analyze the models prevalent to compositional models. In
analyzing each model form, I will show how it relates to my other three
distinctions between the two kinds of biology. I will, for example, show how
simple mathematical abstraction pertains to the models of formal biology and
how complex abstraction relates to the models of compositional biology. I will
also draw some general conclusions regarding where the main locus of
manipulation and intervention work occurs in the two kinds of biology: does
most of the activity occur in modeling or in experimental work?
Mathematical models, prevalent in formal biology, can be interpreted in
the language of first-order logic55 or, as is the case much more often in science,
written directly in mathematics. The philosophy surrounding this form of
models is extremely extensive and cannot possibly be reviewed here, but in
Chapter 4 I will provide a little more detail.
Developing a mathematical model involves a large amount of
(mathematical) abstraction and idealization: (1) properties of objects and
processes need to be quantified, thereby ignoring many different kinds of
qualities that they have, (2) only some of the objects and processes under study
can be quantified, thereby ignoring a host of other objects and processes, (3)
measurement errors in the eventual confirmation of the model are often ignored
as a possible limitation, or problem, that needs to be addressed during the
development of the models, and (4) multiple causal interactions need to be
ignored for purposes of computational expediency. The list is very long and has
                                                  
55 There is, of course, active debate regarding the generality and even utility of
this claim. Elisabeth Lloyd holds that the claim is not generally true – e.g.,
consider models using natural numbers.

been discussed elsewhere.56 The point I want to make here is that mathematical
abstraction, while powerful, involves significant loss in "qualitative" data. It is no
accident that mathematical models apply well to simple objects since, to an
extent, it actively makes simple objects out of some objects that are, perhaps,
inherently complex (e.g., genes).
As we saw above, one aspect of abstraction on which there seems to be
relatively little written concerns the process of parameterization, or
quantification in general. That is, how are the properties of objects and processes
mathematically abstracted? What aspects are ignored when doing this and what
does the abstraction capture about those objects and processes? This process
interests me because formal models consist of some very special sorts of
theoretical kinds, what one might call "mathematical kinds."
In order to relate formal models to the first two distinctions, I will explore
some the arguments in favor of the view that mathematical abstraction of model
development can be understood in terms of the intensional set account of
abstraction presented in the previous section. First, let us assume that the
parameters and variables of a model are its "properties." I am not here concerned
with determining the exact analogical relationship between property and
parameter or variable, I am merely asking the reader to grant that these can be
thought of, at least quantitatively and, in a loose sense, qualitatively, as
properties. Now, a model with more parameters and variables is a model with
more properties, that is, a more concrete model. This matches the mathematical
intuition well. A model with more (appropriately articulated) parameters and
variables is one that can be made to match the concrete system more closely – it
                                                  
56 E.g., Duhem 1977; Levins 1966; Wimsatt 1987; Cartwright 1989.

can be (dis)confirmed more easily and with greater precision. It is also, as the
literature on trade-offs in model building points out, a model with less generality
(applies to a narrow range of concrete and exact cases) and computationally
more expensive. So thinking of parameters and variables as properties of models
is consistent and useful, even if, as the semantic view has argued, we should be
wary of the appropriateness of linguistic analyses of mathematical modeling
(and abstraction).
Mathematical models are not well suited to capture the complex, varied,
and concrete nature of part-organization (part-organization is the fourth
distinction). It is difficult to represent the multiple kinds of processes and
functions in which a single kind of part, as well as many kinds of parts, engage.
A very large number of variables and parameters would have to be introduced
into the models, and these variables and parameters would not be able to capture
the qualitative and "articulated"57 nature of the parts and their interaction.
Theoretical physics and formal biology can easily mathematically abstract
and idealize concrete objects (primarily simple objects). The objects have clear
quantitative properties and causal relations among these properties, belonging to
objects of the same and of different kinds, can be expressed in terms of functional
mathematical relations. Physical science is replete with mathematical functions
relating variables. Ever since at least the development of mathematical natural
philosophy in the 17th century, such functions have been interpreted as
formalizations, that is, mathematical representations, of natural laws58 and the

explored in Chapter 2.

"laws of nature."

51
variables and parameters have been understood as stand-ins for particular
properties of the objects and processes under study.
Consider Newton's second law of mechanics: F = ma.59 "F" can be
interpreted as the total force applied on an object, "m" as the inertial or
"resistance" mass of the object, located at the center of gravity of the object, and
"a" as the acceleration, or rate of change of velocity, of the object. The function,
expressed with an equality and a multiplication represents a law. This law is
supposed to have all the desirable properties a universal law of nature should
have. Numerous other laws, represented mathematically, are familiar to the
reader. The point here is that in theoretical physics and formal biology there are
well-articulated and straightforward mathematical relationships60 among simple
objects, abstracted as theoretical mathematical kinds.
We see this kind of mathematical abstraction and idealization in
mathematical evolutionary genetics as well. There is a difference, however, in
that confirmation of this theory is significantly more difficult due to the
complexities of biological systems.61 Roughly put, formal biology is more top-
down, or "theory-first," than mathematical physical sciences. However, the
commitments about and to abstraction are similar: develop mathematical
variables and parameters representing various properties of objects, processes
and systems, and articulate the relationships between such properties using
mathematical functions.

One of the basic variables in evolutionary genetics is frequency of gene
types. A basic explanandum in this field is to give a dynamically sufficient causal
account, at least in principle, of changes in these frequencies over evolutionary
time (across generations). This is done by employing an exhaustive set of distinct
evolutionary causes; these causes, or "forces" as they are sometimes called, are
represented, even defined, in mathematical terms. Put strongly, the forces are
nothing more than their mathematical representations in the form of models.62 This is, in
fact, why mathematical evolutionary genetics was so amenable to semantic view
analysis, as indicated by the work of, especially, Beatty, Lloyd, and Thompson.
Even if one is a realist believing in the truth of such forces, rather than an
ontologically agnostic modeler emphasizing only the empirical adequacy of such
representations, the scientifically pertinent content of the models is just the
mathematical representations. The causal processes underlying the
representations are unimportant for purposes of theoretical articulation. In
formal biology, theory (in the form of particular models) is developed through
the manipulation of formal symbols.
Now consider the models prevalent in compositional biology,
propositional non-mathematical models and material models. The former are
model forms that have propositional content, that is, some sort of direct semantic
meaning, not represented mathematically. The latter are made out of matter, but
are still more like representations of a concrete system than of the concrete
system itself. In this part of the section on models, I will show how these model
forms are related to the other three distinctions. I will focus more on material

models, especially scale models, as compared to the propositional models,
because I explore the latter in detail in Chapter 4.
Diagrammatic and narrative models can be thought of as propositional
non-mathematical models.63 Diagrams refer immediately to physical objects.
There are, for example, relatively fewer kinds of manipulations that can be done
in diagrammatic models, as compared to mathematical models. Diagrammatic
models, to speak metaphorically, do not exist in a theoretical world of their own
the way mathematical models do. The biologist simply represents, say, the steps
of a gene network in terms of a flow-chart. Although such diagrams, as we will
see in Chapter 4, can guide research, useful manipulation tends to be done
empirically, in laboratory experiments. This is because there are next to no
"degrees of freedom" in the model itself and there is little internal logic to these
models, independently of the concrete system that they directly represent. The
models represent, but cannot provide very much independent insight as a
consequence of manipulation. This is different from saying that very limited
generalizations can be formed from them. A model that cannot, in general, be
manipulated to achieve new results, or learn new things about nature, could still
be a model with a fair amount of generalizability – it might represent, to an
extent, and explain, many objects in nature, even objects of different kinds.
Consider a diagrammatic representation, such as a flow chart, of a
hierarchical gene regulatory network. This representation indicates the genes
and their temporal pattern of activation and inhibition, often showing early
genes affecting, in a cascading fashion, downstream genes. First, note that this

on narrative models, see, for example, Danto 1985; Griesemer 1996; Hull 1975,
1981, 1992; Richards 1981, 1992.

model cannot be manipulated. It is the result of many experiments, often using
genetic knock-out techniques, employed to establish patterns of activation and
inhibition of genes on other genes (patterns include one-to-one, many-to-one, or
one-to-many activation and/or inhibition).  For example, if knocking out a gene
has particular phenotypic effects, then effort is employed to work out the
mechanisms by means of which that gene achieves those effects (e.g.:  What other
genes does it affect? What are the biochemical pathways by means of which the
genes involved aid in producing the phenotypic effect?) The manipulation exists
not in the model itself—in the representation—but exists instead in the practice of
the laboratory, which aims to figure out the causal processes at work among
component parts of the system through experimental manipulations and
controls. The manipulation or intervention64 work, which is essential for all science,
occurs, for formal biology, often in the model itself whereas, for compositional biology, it
happens in the experimental work of which a model is then made to summarize (or guide
further) results.65 I am not denying either, or both, that empirical work is
important for formal biology or that theoretical is crucial for compositional
biology, but I am arguing that the locus of manipulation and resource
employment is quite different in the two kinds of biological science.

65 I realize that this is a contentious claim that focuses on one particular
understanding of models as just a representation device for theoretical purposes.
Some might argue that the laboratory experimental work is itself guided by
protocol models or what one might call "models of method or practice." Practice
oriented sociologists and philosophers of science such as Bruno Latour, Elihu
Gerson and James Griesemer seem to advocate a broader notion of models (e.g.,
Latour and Woolgar 1986; Gerson and Griesemer 1997). While I fully invite a
broader notion of models, for my limited purposes in this dissertation I focus on
models as a theoretical activity. So when I use the term "model" it does refer to an
inscribed representation with theoretical import.

As an example of the extent and utility of generalization in compositional
biology, let us explore a flow chart of, say, Hox-gene action. The chart might be
applicable to many organisms. This is precisely because such gene regulatory
networks are highly "conserved" across taxa, as work over the last 20 years on
this high-level regulatory gene type has shown. Again, this can only be known
through repeated inductive efforts, and the diagram must be repeatedly checked
with experimentation in diverse new taxa. Although predictions for Hox-gene
action in a previously untested target system are possible from known source
systems (often "model systems"), such predictions are fallible and require
constant experimental verification (and the background properties in the
intensional set can repeatedly fail to apply!).66 Flow charts of downstream and
more taxon-specific genetic regulatory networks are even less generalizable.
Similar arguments could be made for narrative models, which are also
descriptions, in idealized form, of the action occurring in concrete systems. Such
models describe, in language, the important features of a concrete set of events;
they analyze and represent such events into stages, objects and processes. 
I will now turn to material models and how they relate to the other three
distinctions in this chapter. Consider a scale model of the jaw of a snake. This
model could show the shape, structure, and way in which the jaw disarticulates
when the snake eats a large prey item. But note that it is highly abstracted – there
are numerous properties of a real snake jaw that it does not show. Even a real
snake jaw, showing just the bone and teeth, could not show the blood vessels, the
muscles, the nerves, and could certainly not show the active jaw. Of course one

difficult to separate in compositional biology.

could observe a live snake, but then one could not observe the jaw itself. Models
of physical parts67 involve abstraction in order to be useful.
A specimen removed from its habitat in nature, prepared appropriately,
and stored in a museum is a generalization of the species in nature. The properties
of the specimen represent the wider range of properties of its conspecifics in
nature. Even if we have multiple specimens of the same population, these
specimens are representations of the complete population in nature. They do not
capture the full range of variation in anatomy, physiology and behavior of all
individuals of that population. Notoriously, specimens also cannot show
breeding potential between populations, which is a criterion for defining species,
or general behavior of individuals. Many properties of the individuals and
populations in nature are left out in the construction of what Griesemer calls
"remnant models," that is, museum specimens that generalize from the species in
nature.68 Note that these models are themselves parts of a species, and the species
that they represent can also be thought of as parts of an ecosystem.
Strictly speaking, there are two forms of abstraction going on in these
cases of material modeling, both of which can be described by eliminating
properties (from an intensional set). First, there is abstraction in the strict sense
discussed above: properties of objects are removed. For example, the properties
of the bone are lost if one makes a plastic model or the full range of variation of
the population (a property) is lost due to sampling. Second, there is abstraction
defined in terms of omitting certain objects that, often, are parts of a system. This is
                                                  
67 These models thus refer directly to part organization (distinction 4 below).

what Gerson calls "buffering."69 In the jaw case, leaving out nerves or blood
vessel is buffering; this can also be reinterpreted as a case of abstraction in that
certain properties of the system (some of its parts, and interactions among parts,
which can be thought of as relational properties70) are left out of the
representation.71 Note that these are two very different forms of abstraction. In
the case of buffering an idealization occurs because concrete objects are removed
from consideration in actuality – in the case of abstraction proper (removal of
properties), all the concrete objects remain in actuality, but any number and type
of their properties are subtracted in imagination. Buffering can be described as a
removal of system properties, but the concrete nature of this removal—through
the removal of concrete parts—must be noted.
These cases match the intensional set account of abstraction quite well, as
can be seen in how straightforwardly discussion about properties applies to
these model forms. What about the components of the material model, its parts,
can they be considered theoretical kinds? I believe that they can. The poison-
fangs of a snake jaw-model, for example, capture some of the important features
of many concrete snake jaws in a patchy way. Naturally, they do not represent
the full variation of fangs, or even the functioning of fangs, but they do represent
the approximate structure and placement of these weapons and they also hint at
the functioning of all such fangs in nature. Thus, the fangs represent a complex
                                                  
69 Gerson 1998 (in prep).
70 I am grateful to Elisabeth Lloyd for this suggestion; Gerson seeks to keep
abstraction and buffering as two separate and unrelated concepts (Gerson pers.
comm.).
71 Computer imaging techniques could be interpreted as providing another way
of doing this. Computer modeling, in general, is an important activity that falls
outside of the scope of my dissertation. Undoubtedly, a full account of modeling,
and a full story of the two kinds of biology that I am here presenting, requires an
analysis of computer techniques.

theoretical kind, subject to complex abstraction. Similar arguments could be
made for other parts of the material model.
In conclusion, I want to explore some general considerations concerning
the model forms pertinent to formal and compositional biology. Simple objects
can often be usefully represented in terms of mathematical models. For example,
the stability and reliability of formation of NaCl can be explained in terms of
differences in a quantity, electronegativity, and the mathematically-expressed
dynamics of the electron shell structure of each of the two constituent elements.
The simple object "point mass" is an abstract assumption of gravitational theory;
it serves a specific role in the mathematics involved in this theory. However,
simple objects can also sometimes be explained, with significant loss of realism,
by material models.72 NaCl can also be represented in material model form.
However, such a model does not adequately represent the notion of charge nor
probability distribution of electron location. The latter quantum phenomenon is
one of many phenomena that cannot be represented in macrophysical models,
but can be represented in mathematical models.
Conversely, complex objects can, with significant loss of realism, be
represented in mathematical models. For example, when computationally-
tractable mathematical models of gene networks are presented they often do not
capture much of the real nature of the action of real genes.73 They may capture
the dynamical patterns of "interaction," but they do not capture the actual
biochemical mechanisms underlying the dynamical patterns. Complex objects
are often best represented by propositional non-mathematical or material
                                                  
72 Hence, my first and third distinction do not completely covary.
73 For example, Kauffman 1993; von Dassow et al. 2000.

Chapter 1

59
models, whether scale, remnant, diagrammatic, or narrative. Complex objects or
processes that differ from each other (of even the same kind!) in important
qualitative ways not captured well by quantitative methods, even in a space of
sufficient dimensionality, are better represented in terms of propositional non-
mathematical and material models.74 For example, it is theoretically easier and
more accurate to describe different cell or tissue types with qualitative properties
rather than mathematical theoretical kinds. It is more pertinent to articulate the
reactions occurring in the Krebs cycle of biochemical respiration using qualitative
aspects of the types of chemicals involved (e.g., how one enzyme type removes a
certain part of a molecule to form another molecule). Explaining the mechanisms
among parts is a science of qualities, not a science of quantities. Furthermore,
articulating the functions of parts can also not be done usefully in mathematical
expressions but requires, rather, an explanatory narrative. These are themes to
which I shall return in Chapter 4. Suffice it to say here that the models of
compositional biology rely on complex abstraction on parts, which are complex
objects, of a system.
                                                  
74 This is not to say that mathematical models never serve a purpose in
compositional biology. For example, mathematical models developed by systems
theory in the 60s and 70s were explicitly meant to analyze compositional
systems. Furthermore, recent work developing formal models in, for example,
genetic regulatory networks (e.g., Kauffman 1993; von Dassow et al 2000) and
communication and task allocation in ant colonies (e.g., Gordon et al 1992.;
Franks and Tofts 1994) also shows the presence and occasional utility of
mathematical models in compositional biology. However, it is clear that such
models are rare and are often received with skepticism.

1.5 Idealization or Irrelevance versus Relevance of Part-Whole Organization
The fourth distinction concerns the importance, and conceptualization, of
part-whole organization in the two kinds of biology. My argument is that formal
biology either ignores or has a very idealized notion of parts (e.g., demes of a
population), which is defined by a few mathematical properties and does not
capture the mechanistic details of these parts. Compositional biology, on the
other hand, is specifically concerned with working out the details of the
compositional system, including the structure, process, and function of its
hierarchically-organized and integrated parts.
In philosophy, wholes and parts, despite their importance, have received
significantly less attention than either the kinds and instances, or objects,
properties, and relations. Philosophy of science has also not concerned itself very
much with them, despite their significance in, for example, the biological sciences
and in articulated complex systems.75 In order to motivate an analysis of parts, let
me first define exactly how I will use "parts" and "wholes." There are two ways in
which I will not use these terms. First, there is a tradition concerning what one
might call "parts of ideas" in which mental constructs such as ideas, classes,
(intensional!) sets, etc. are thought of as being decomposable into sub-ideas, sub-
classes, or even aggregations of extensional objects.76 Here, "part" is used in the
sense of "part of a concept/idea." I am specifically not using part in this way as
                                                  
75 Although, see Kaufmann 1971; Levins and Lewontin 1985; Lewontin and
Levins 1988; Nagel 1961; Wimsatt 1974, 1986.
76 For example, Lewis 1990.

61
this is not, and could not be, the object of study of any scientist, biologist,
physicist or chemist.
Second, there is an intellectual discourse interested in what I will call
"idealized parts" in which assumed concrete objects of any sort are idealized as
individuals and then a logic of aggregation is developed that is supposed to
capture concepts such as identity, existence, uniqueness, etc. This analysis of
wholes and parts is found particularly in abstract metaphysics and logic. Here
parts have been defined by very abstract spatio-temporal logical criteria. The
modern investigations in mereology (the study of parts) by, among others,
Lésniewski, Carnap, and Leonard and Goodman were concerned with the
abstract formal properties of individuals and their spatio-temporally defined
parts.77  Contemporary discussions continue in this vein.78 The relevance of
abstract mereology to dynamic and functionally-based biological systems seems
very tenuous, if at all existent. This is because, in the metaphysical and logical
tradition of mereology, the material nature, interaction, and theory-dependence
of the objects are all ignored – objects and processes qua parts are idealized to the
extent that they can no longer be scientifically studied. Often, only topological
relations among parts are considered interesting.
In this dissertation, I shall not be concerned with these views on parts (and
wholes). I consider the "part of a concept/idea" a branch of set-theory or, more
broadly, logic. This does pertain to my analysis of abstraction using intensional
sets; it is irrelevant, however, for an analysis of parts as studied by scientists. I

and have not found it useful at all in an analysis of how parts are actually
investigated in biology, whether it be formal or compositional. Even in formal
biology, the parts are idealized using mathematical, not metaphysical, tools.
Furthermore, the purposes of part idealization are also very different in
mereology and in formal biology.
The parts that I am concerned with are the ones pertinent to scientific
investigation. Many systems in nature are composed of parts. The paradigmatic
system for such an analysis, currently as well as in the history of philosophy and
of science, is, of course, the organism.79 But other kinds of concrete systems also
have parts, in some sense: planetary systems with a central star; atoms with
protons, neutrons, and electrons; (perhaps) light beams with "photons"; artificial
mechanical systems such as bridges and houses; artificial electronic systems
including computers; and, in biology, genes in the genome, organisms in
populations, populations in species, and species in clades. This list is not
exhaustive by any means.
In this section of the chapter I argue that although some of the systems
investigated by theoretical physics and formal biology can be thought of as
compositional, the theoretical focus in analyzing these systems is to abstract and
                                                  
79 Two particularly captivating accounts, which discuss the relationships between
mechanism and teleology in their analysis of the integrated and compositionally
hierarchically-organized organism, are Aristotle's Generation of Animals (1990)
and Parts of Animals (1993) and Kant's Critique of Judgment [the Third Critique,
1952 (1790)]. The conceptual confusion that the organism has caused vis-à-vis
especially teleology is captured in Kant's statement that "it is absurd for men… to
hope that maybe another Newton may some day arise, to make intelligible to us
even the genesis of but a blade of grass from natural laws that no design has
ordered." (Kant 1953 (1790). This confusion is evidence for the significant
differences between an analysis of the compositionally-organized organism and
abstracted physical "mechanistic" systems. In a sense, it is precisely this
difference that I am trying to capture in my dissertation.

idealize mathematically, rather than provide representations and explanations of
the compositional organization. Put differently, formal biology does study, for
example, genes and populations as components of systems (i.e., the genome and
metapopulations, respectively), but the emphasis is undoubtedly on abstraction
through finding a few simple mathematically-expressed relations between the
few properties of the objects investigated. Compositional biology, on the other
hand, seeks to describe and explain, through a variety of model forms and a
particular kind of compositional explanatory pattern to be explored in detail in
Chapter 5, the compositional structure, process, and function of a system. It does
not necessarily seek to capture the few essential properties, precisely because
parts, which are non-equivalent within a kind, and are complex objects, rarely
have such properties.
Much of theoretical physics is interested in characterizing the properties
and relations of highly abstract objects (e.g., electrons, fundamental particles,
photons, charges, point masses, etc.). Although these can be sometimes be
thought of as components of a system, articulating their general properties and
relations between such properties captured in mathematical laws are the focus of
investigation. Expressing such laws does not require considering them as parts of
the concrete system in which they are (sometimes) found. Furthermore, even
when characterization of a "system" is at issue (e.g., the Schrödinger equation for
some element, such as Helium) the parts of the system are not considered
interesting qua material parts. Abstractions, not partitioning, are of interest here.
In these cases the following are not considered of interest, or even coherent: (1)
feedback processes among parts, (2) the function of parts (and what has, loosely,

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
64
been called, "teleology"), (3) the uniqueness of particular parts (i.e., non-
equivalence/non-interchangeability of parts).
Furthermore, certainly it is true that aspects of the mathematical laws and
principles were discovered through material or thought experimentation on
compositional systems, loosely speaking. For example, the solar system,
mechanical systems with levers and pulleys, electric circuits, atomic structures,
multiple wave sources, etc. were used to determine abstract laws, but, again, the
theoretical goal was not to describe these particular "compositional" systems, but
rather to explain the mathematical properties, as well as the laws and principles
employing those properties, of the objects and processes under the purview of
the particular area of physical theory. Compositionality in much of theoretical
physics is not considered important – it is almost irrelevant.
There is, however, an area of theoretical physics, in which consideration
of, and explicit reference to, compositional systems seems particularly important
– thermodynamics. Here the behavior of populations of molecules is explicitly
explained in terms of the behavior of the component/part molecules (e.g., heat
content explained in terms of average speed of the molecules). I still think that
this is quite different from the compositional focus that exists in compositional
biology. Compositionality in thermodynamics is much less rich, refers to
significantly fewer kinds of relations, is completely "additive" in both the
mathematical and metaphorical sense, explicitly assumes the equivalence of
component "parts," has no functional or "teleological" component, and is
completely captured in precise mathematical formulations.
Furthermore, the goal of (statistical) thermodynamics is, again as in
mechanics, to articulate general principles among variables that do not refer to

Chapter 1
A Philosophical Framework
65
the compositional structure (e.g., heat content, efficiency, entropy). In short,
while many areas of theoretical physics rely on compositional systems for
discovery of theoretical principles, and while a few areas contain compositional
systems, in a loose way, in their theoretical principles, the goal, as discussed in
the preceding three distinctions, is to describe through mathematical laws and
models the essential simple properties of the simple objects through simple
abstraction; as we shall further explore in chapter 5, these laws and models can
often be unified. It is in these senses that parts are irrelevant to most of
theoretical physics, or highly idealized in an area that can be construed as
compositional, thermodynamics.
The goal of mathematical evolutionary genetics and theoretical
mathematical ecology, key cases of formal biology, is, methodologically
speaking, the same as the goal of theoretical physics, as I have been arguing
throughout this chapter: seek general and idealized mathematical laws and
models. Although the genome is clearly a compositional system with multiple
interacting genes, the theoretical framework of mathematical evolutionary
genetics abstracts away from this in a number of ways that I will detail.
Furthermore, the compositional and hierarchical structure of populations is also
abstracted in a number of ways. In what follows, I will show how compositional
organization is made irrelevant or highly idealized by the mathematical
evolutionary genetic framework.
Typically, the models of evolutionary genetic focus on the properties of
individual genetic loci – an "additive" bias is quite powerful in this field.80
                                                  
80 See, for example, Lloyd 1988, chapters 5 and 7; Wade and Goodnight 1998;
Wimsatt 1984.

Evolutionary forces are often represented by causal factors acting on single loci.
Consider the Hardy-Weinberg principle (in its simplest form), the infinite-allele
model of mutation, Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, and
definitions of genetic additive effects (on genetic variance) in quantitative
genetics. A powerful claim for the legitimacy of such an additive bias stems from
George Williams's argument for the universal validity of calculating additive
genetic effects by averaging the effect of a gene across all genetic backgrounds in
a population; this is justified, according to Williams, "No matter how functionally
dependent a gene may be, and no matter how complicated its interactions with
other genes and environmental factors."81 Under this view, genetic context is
considered unimportant because it can be averaged out of causal existence. This
is a prevalent view in population and quantitative genetics, and is part of the
Fisherian school of thought, to be further discussed in Chapter 3.
Of further interest for the relationship between theoretical physics and
formal biology is the fact that Fisher even employed an analogy between natural
selection and thermodynamics:
It will be noticed that the fundamental theorem [of natural
selection]… bears some remarkable resemblances to the second law
of thermodynamics. Both are properties of populations, or
aggregates, true irrespective of the nature of the units which
compose them; both are statistical laws; each requires the constant
increase of a measurable quantity, in the one case the entropy of a
physical system and in the other the fitness… of a biological
population.82
Fisher did qualify this analogy by stating that, for example, that thermodynamic
systems are permanent whereas biological systems are not and that entropy
leads to disorganization whereas higher fitness leads to "progressively higher
                                                  
81 Williams 1966, p. 57.

67
organization in the organic world."83 Despite these qualifications, it is clear that
Fisher had a methodological orientation compatible with that of theoretical
physics.
Let us return to the notion of genetic average effect. With the presence of
population structure and subdivision, averaging across all individuals in the total
population is no longer empirically adequate or justified because individuals in
different subpopulations are isolated, to an extent, from other individuals and
"experience" a different genetic background. That is, the gene frequencies of
particular loci are different in different demes. This means that particular gene
alleles that are positively correlated in one deme could be negatively correlated
in another deme, hence the additive genetic effect of a particular locus will differ
in the two demes.84 With population structure we can no longer average across
total (meta)population background. Compositional organization has become
crucial from a theoretical point of view. This point is made and explored in some
of the key textbooks, for example Hartl and Clark 1989 on population genetics,
                                                  
83 Fisher 1958, p. 40.
84 This is a separate point from the importance placed on interactions between
pairs, triples, etc. of loci using the additive (and dominance) effects of each locus.
This latter point concerns the relative weight placed, theoretically and
empirically, on interaction effects built up, using, for example, analysis of
variance, from additive effects, for calculation of total genetic variances in the
population. (See, e.g. Falconer and Mackay, pp. 129-130; Wade 1992, pp. 39-42.)
Here too there is an additive bias in the field, in the sense of being biased against
the importance of interaction. Falconer and Mackay, for example, write:
"[Statistical] Interactions involving larger [than three] numbers of loci contribute
so little variance that they can be ignored, and we shall confine our attention to
two-factor interactions since these suffice to illustrate the principles involved."
(p. 129) Wade 2000 argues that given enough loci (and, in reality, there are many
loci) the number of three-way and higher order interaction terms between as
many loci (e.g., three-way interactions between three loci) become, in aggregate,
"orders of magnitude greater than the number of additive and dominance terms
typically used to describe evolutionary processes." (p. 215) For Wade, then, we
are unjustified in ruling out a priori the effect of these interaction terms on genetic
variance, irrespective of the existence and nature of population structure.

68
and Falconer and Mackay 1996 on quantitative genetics, even if it is underplayed
particularly in the latter and in a fair amount of the theoretical work presented in
population genetics and quantitative genetics.
Yet, even when gene interaction becomes important due to population
structure, and both are investigated and modeled85, the amount and kind of
compositionality is highly limited and idealized. Few mathematical properties of
the highly abstracted parts are measured or postulated [e.g., additivity,
dominance, and interaction phenotypic and fitness effects; gene frequency in,
and sizes of, hierarchically-structured populations; inbreeding effect/F-statistic
(indicating extent of population subdivision)]. From very few variables, a fair
amount of the theoretical structure of mathematical evolutionary genetics
concerned with population structure has been developed.
In these cases, kinds of idealizations concerning compositional structure
similar to those in theoretical physics get made. Consider, for example, that
genetic effects are measured in terms of effects on the phenotype or on fitness
rather than in terms of an understanding of the content of the effect (i.e., what is
the mechanistic cause? What is the qualitative nature of the interactions?) The
different loci are still considered qualitatively equivalent in that each of them has
the same kinds of variables and parameters assigned to them, even if they have
different quantitative values for the given variables and parameters. The detailed
nature of the myriad qualitative processes occurring is not considered.
Furthermore, in so far as population structure is concerned, the parts there are
also considered equivalent and defined by a few variables and, therefore, few

Christiansen 1999; Otto and Feldman 1997; Wagner et al. 1998.

69
relations exist between them, which can indeed be expressed mathematically.
Furthermore, both for gene interaction and population structure, in so far as the
mathematical theory is concerned, the parts do not, in any sense, exist "for the
sake of the whole" – they are not mutually-determining and necessary as they
are, for example in organismic development or in the appropriate functioning of
biochemical networks in molecular biology (e.g., Krebs cycle).86 It is to these
"incarnate" parts, the components investigated by compositional biological, that I
now very briefly turn.
Concrete parts and wholes are studied primarily in complex, integrated,
and hierarchically-organized systems with division of labor. In compositional
biological sciences, such as comparative anatomy, developmental biology,
physiology, biochemistry, cellular biology, and even systematics87 integrated,
hierarchical and functionally-distinct parts are the central objects of
investigation. System partitioning and articulation88, in empirical and theoretical
activity, are the primary concern.
The parts and wholes of compositional biology are the topic of much of
this dissertation. Chapters 2 and 4 are dedicated, respectively, to how different
                                                  
86 Although we no longer believe in "teleology" in scientific biology, there is a
sense in which the issues of mutual part-whole determination and necessity still
remains an important theme, captured particularly well by both Aristotle and
Kant. See, for example, McLaughlin 2001.
87 Although systematics does not study the functioning of organic systems, it
does study parts in order to establish hierarchical similarities across systems to
infer genealogy. The detailed particularities of parts of different species are
compared to establish similarities and differences across taxa. This is the
comparative method. Systematics does use computer algorithms and
quantitative methods of analysis to find most likely trees, but I interpret these
methods as methods and not as theory. Theory in systematics is genealogy
inferred from similarity of the parts of the species. It is, unfortunately, beyond
the scope of this dissertation to analyze systematics.

theoretical perspectives analyze different kinds of parts via their different
"frames of partitioning" and to how models concerning these parts are
articulated. Half of chapters 3 and 5 also concern how compositional biology,
respectively, studies parts through the discipline of evolutionary developmental
biology and how various aspects of parts are explained. Here I will thus not
repeat my downstream analysis of parts.
Whereas parts are the central object of study in compositional biology, in
theoretical physics and formal biology, parts are considered irrelevant or are
highly idealized.

indicating similarity, would show the two formal sciences as much more similar
than either is to compositional biology. This indicates, I think that the deep
commitments of a broad scientific perspective play a larger role in organizing the
work and theory of science than the area of study (e.g., simple physical vs.
complex animate objects). The commitments of formal versus compositional
biology (and science) are different with respect to every distinction of my
framework, as can be seen in Table 2. (1.2). Are these differences merely
descriptive ones that are a consequence of particular historical developments or
are they "in principle" differences that stem from deep in the logic and methods
of the two kinds of science? Answering this question gets to the heart of the issue
of whether a synthesis between these two kinds of science is possible and, more
fundamentally, what a synthesis even means (e.g., compatibility, but
independence, of distinct theories or deep integration of different theories). I will
leave an exploration of this question to Chapter 3, but I hope that in this chapter I
have made it clear that we need philosophical tools, particularly from the field of
metaphysics and epistemology, to tease apart differences in methodology and
goals between formal and compositional biology.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
73
Chapter 2: An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives in Compositional
Biology
2.1 Framing and Goals
In Chapter 1, I made a distinction between "formal biology" and
"compositional biology" that I developed using four distinctions: (1) attention to
simple versus complex objects, (2) employment of simple versus complex
abstraction, (3) usage of mathematical versus material or non-mathematical
propositional models89, and (4) consideration of part-whole organization as
irrelevant or idealized versus relevant.90 There, I provided the grounds for a clear
distinction between the two kinds of biology primarily through their different
practices of abstraction, which includes their practices of modeling.91 [Although I
did mention parts (e.g., as (1) complex objects, as well as (4) being relevant for
                                                  
89 Note, as I argued, that compositional biology does, on rare occasions, use
mathematical models that refer explicitly to the material part structure and
organization (e.g., topological models for developmental biology) – these
mathematical models could in principle be mapped in a state space and thus be
subject to a semantic view analysis, but they rarely are and, furthermore, they are
not subject to as much independent mathematical manipulation as models of
theoretically (in the mathematical sense) rich mathematical evolutionary
genetics. Furthermore, mathematical evolutionary genetics and theoretical
ecology do, on occasion, use material and even, for example, diagrammatic
models (see, e.g., Griesemer 1991a; Plutynski 2001). But the contrast I am making
here is based on a strong correlation between form of model used and kind of
biology.
90 In Chapter 5, I develop a fifth distinction having to do with the patterns of
explanation common to both kinds of biology. For the sake of clarity and linear
argument development, I will not be concerned with this distinction until then.
91 I will return to this theme in Chapter 4.

Chapter 2

74
compositional biology, but either irrelevant or highly idealized for formal
biology).] The attention given to the first three distinctions was
disproportionately large compared to the last, because both types of science rely
heavily on abstractions (including models) whereas only compositional science
focuses on parts.92 In this chapter, I will complement the analysis of abstraction
given in the first chapter with an explicit analysis of parts.
The goal of this chapter will be, first, to discuss theoretical perspectives, as
consisting of guiding biases and assumptions. I will employ the work of
Kauffman, Wimsatt, and Griesemer, but will develop my own views on
theoretical perspectives and their relationship to disciplines. I will also show that
textbooks can be used as a source from which to glean the guiding biases and
assumptions of the theoretical perspective of a discipline. Furthermore, such
perspectives exist in both formal biology and compositional biology, but they
play different roles in these two kinds of biology.
After this general discussion, I will provide an empirical analysis (sensu
conceptual data gleaned from textbooks, for a philosophy of science analysis) of
theoretical perspectives in compositional biology. I will examine a set of
disciplines in compositional biology—comparative anatomy, functional
morphology, physiology, developmental biology, cell biology, and
biochemistry—and explicate their respective guiding biases and assumptions. I
                                                  
92 In distinguishing between the two kinds of science (or even two things in
general), one can discuss either those aspects that they have in common, but
might differ somewhat on, or those aspects that are completely different. Of
course there is a continuum between these (i.e., if common aspects differ too
much, then such aspects become different aspects), but discussing abstraction in
the two types of science falls in the former category (i.e., both sciences abstract,
but do so differently), whereas discussing parts falls in the latter category since
parts are the sole purview of compositional biology.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
75
will extract the assumptions and biases guiding each field by analyzing the
organization and content of canonical advanced textbooks in each of these six
fields in compositional biology. One result of my analysis is that each of these
disciplines partitions a system very differently. Compositional biology is a non-
unified (and, potentially, "non-unifiable") endeavor consisting of multiple
perspectives, an important reason for the complexity of its objects and its
processes of abstraction.93 I will summarize my investigation in a table
indicating, for each theoretical perspective (discipline), (1) examples of parts, (2)
criteria of partitioning, and (3) general lists of guiding biases.
After presenting my study of textbooks, I will relate the results of my
analysis to the framework developed in Chapter 1. The series of six case studies
investigated here teach an interesting lesson. My general framework paints the
picture of two distinct "ideal types" of kinds of biology, formal and
compositional. But, although each of the six case studies is a clear and
recognizable case of compositional biology, some of them fail to meet exactly all
the four distinctions of Chapter 1. In particular, the existence of complex
abstraction and the use of material or non-mathematical propositional models
are sometimes not met completely in the theoretical perspectives of
compositional biology explored below. For example, functional morphology has
                                                  
93 To what extent formal biology, and formal science, such as theoretical physics,
is unified and unifiable is an open question. For arguments in favor of its
unification see Friedman 1974, 1981, 1983; Kitcher 1981, 1985; Smocovitis 1996;
for arguments against its unification see Galison and Stump 1995; Cartwright
1999. As I will discuss in Chapter 5, I ally myself with the view that unification is
possible, desirable, and even actual in some of the theoretical work of formal
science and formal biology. For instance, Michael Wade noted that he considers
the Price-Hamilton formulation of kin selection and group selection an important
piece of unification with a hierarchy of abstract models articulated in, for
instance, Wade 1985; see also Frank 1997, 1998.

a mathematical component that assumes (to an extent) simple kinds and employs
formal models. And the molecules of biochemistry can be thought of as simple
objects, to an extent. Although some of the theoretical perspectives I discuss
sometimes have formal aspects, they are still a compositional biology, as I show
below. As a result of both such intra-category variation, and complex abstraction
in delineating a kind of biology, defining them and determining their extension
cannot be done through the dogmatic exercise of applying necessary and
sufficient conditions.
2.2 On Theoretical Perspectives
In what follows, I will first turn to an analysis of Wimsatt's, Kauffman's,
and Griesemer's notion of theoretical perspective. Although their views differ,
their opinions provide some common ground for defining this concept. After
providing a robust view of theoretical perspective, I provide a map for how I will
employ this concept in my analysis of the different methods of partitioning
adopted by the different disciplines of compositional biology. The sources of
data for my philosophical (not scientific!) empirical analysis are the canonical
textbooks of each discipline, a method for which I provide justification.
2.2.1 Kauffman, Wimsatt, and Griesemer on Theoretical Perspectives
In philosophy of science, there is a long tradition of describing and
emphasizing the importance of the theoretical units involved in scientific
activity. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Kuhn, Lakatos, and Quine

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
77
emphasized the theory-ladenness of both observation and experiment in their
respective notions of paradigm, research program, and web of belief. In
philosophy of biology, the importance of theoretical units in guiding scientific
activity has been developed in the work of Kauffman, Wimsatt, and Griesemer.94
Their work has numerous similarities, including an emphasis on the guiding
biases and assumptions of the theoretical units and a concern with, primarily, the
static aspects of scientific theory as opposed to a focus on change and its causes,
which are two themes that Kuhn, Lakatos, and Quine stress. I am particularly
drawn to their work because it focuses on biology and it takes the compositional
organization of biological objects, in nature and in theory, as central. This is not a
topic of concern in Kuhn, Lakatos, and Quine, who develop a more general
account of scientific theory and its processes of accommodation of, and change in
response to, novel phenomena, theories, and methods.
 
I will now turn to an analysis of theoretical perspectives, with a particular
focus on biases concerning partitioning, as it appears in Kauffman's, Wimsatt's,
and Griesemer's work. After this, I will articulate my own views on these issues.
In an important paper that has practically been forgotten, the biologist
Stuart Kauffman develops a particular kind of explanation that he calls an
"articulation of parts explanation." He justifiably claims that these explanations
are "prevalent in biological sciences."95 Such an explanation emphasizes the
processes by means of which the parts of a system interact to cause a certain
outcome.96 The explanation is the account of how such parts and processes
                                                  
94 Kauffman 1971; Wimsatt 1974, 1994; Griesemer 2000. Also Gerson pers. com.
95 Kauffman 1971, p. 257.
96 As we will see in much more detail in Chapter 5, this explanation is an instance
of a Cummins' style analytical explanation that appeals to the capacities of parts

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
78
articulate to cause an outcome. Presumably, the description of the activity of a
transmembrane protein sensitive to some extracellular chemical (e.g., a hormone)
which then releases an intracellular molecule involved in some metabolic
cascade would count as an articulation of parts explanation. Kauffman remains
vague both in his account of what an explanation is and in what the "articulation"
relation is (i.e.: is it the way that parts relate to one another via processes as the
"glue"? is it the relation between parts and processes? is it the relation of the part-
process system to the outcome?).
Despite the weaknesses of his analysis of explanation and process,
Kauffman's concept of "adequate description" is a useful one similar to Wimsatt's
and Griesemer's concept of "theoretical perspective." He writes, "[1] Given an
adequate description of an organism as doing any particular thing, we will use
that description to help us decompose the organism into particular parts and
processes which articulate together to cause it to behave as described. [2] For
different descriptions of what the organism is doing, we may decompose it into
parts in different ways."97 An "adequate description" thus provides grounds for
partitioning an organism (in different ways for different descriptions);
"theoretical perspectives," as we shall see, play the same role.
In an effort to provide further theoretical underpinnings for his notion of
an adequate description, Kauffman develops the idea of a "conjugate, coherent
decomposition." For his argument to be internally consistent, the system
                                                                                                                                                      
of a system to explain a capacity, from a particular theoretical point of view, of
the system. Part capacities are different in kind from one another and are simpler
than system capacities.
97 Kauffman 1971, p. 258.

Chapter 2

79
decomposition must be determined by the adequate description. Kauffman
explains:
Parts and processes are accepted more or less jointly, and with
them, the adequacy of a particular articulation of parts explanation
in which just those parts and processes are seen as fitting together
to yield the behavior in question. Other causal consequences of
these parts are then considered irrelevant. I will call such a
decomposition of a system a conjugate, coherent decomposition, for
it is conjugate to a particular view of what the system is doing, and
coherent in that it provides an articulation of parts explanation of
how the system does whatever is specified in that particular view
of it.98
An adequate description thus sets the framework for a decomposition of the system, which
ultimately provides a description-specific articulation of parts explanation. This is
exactly the same inferential process as in Wimsatt 1974 where a theoretical
perspective sets the framework for a part-decomposition of the system, which, in
turn, suggests an explanation of how the system performs its perspective-specific
behavior.
Consistent with, and inspired by, the themes in the science of the 60s and
70s, Kauffman suggested that a purely symbolic "cybernetic model" first be
developed when attempting to develop an articulation of parts explanation. This
model would only subsequently be filled in by actual causal mechanisms. Thus,
the adequate description was supposed to produce a decomposition that then
specified an abstract and symbolic cybernetic model that then, together with "a
specific set of causal mechanisms," became a "hypothesis requiring verification."99
Kauffman fails to follow up this inferential train with a theory, or even an
account, of hypothesis (or model) confirmation. Kauffman also does not present
the form that such a cybernetic model would take, but presumably it would

consist of (feedback) relations, of various strengths of correlations, between
variables – these variables would fundamentally refer to the part-whole
organization of the system, thus while the model is mathematical (my 3rd
distinction), it refers intimately to the part-whole organization (my 4th
distinction).
Whereas Kauffman focuses on a particular form of explanation, Wimsatt
is concerned with the overall theoretical structure of different biological sciences,
including their guiding biases and assumptions, particularly with respect to the
activity of partitioning. In a relatively recent article, Wimsatt displays his broad
concerns in that he discusses the role of problems and "explanatory closure" (see
footnote 109) in theoretical perspectives, "there is a reasonably well-defined class
of problems which can be solved without bringing in information from outside
the perspective. …Thus there are paradigmatic anatomical, physiological, and
genetic problems, though no one believes that these approaches individually
exhaust what may be said about the organism."100
In an almost classic article 20 years earlier, Wimsatt notes that each
theoretical perspective "implies or suggests criteria for the identification and
individuation of parts, and thus generates a 'decomposition' of the system into
parts."101 Wimsatt then argues that such decompositions could be simple (for the
objects of physics) or complex (for biological systems). A very informative figure,
presented by Wimsatt, representing the partitioning of a rock and a fruit fly
under distinct theoretical perspectives captures this distinction between simple
and complex partitioning (see Appendix Figure 2.1). The spatial partitioning of a

81
rock remains fairly robust under different theoretical perspectives, but the
spatio-temporal partitioning of a fly certainly does not.
Wimsatt contrasts this compositional activity of partitioning with the
abstractive activity of representing a hierarchical and complex part-whole system
in terms of highly abstract state variables.102 Note that as was the case with
Kauffman, Wimsatt's suggestions regarding mathematical abstraction
specifically concern part-whole systems rather than, for example, the properties
of electrons or monadically-considered genes. Wimsatt's abstract representation
is very difficult to follow (Appendix Figure 2.2). As I understand it103, the
properties of a system are quantified, under a particular theoretical perspective,
as state variables (to eventually make a state space) and then the strengths of
causal interactions (determined from statistical associations?) between these
variables are assessed. Sets of state variables with strong mutual causal
interactions are then partitioned as clusters or parts (i.e., S1, S2, and S3 in 2a). By
reducing state space dimensionality, such parts would seem to make modeling
as well as numerical analysis simpler.
It is unclear to what extent these state-variable mathematical parts map
onto the concrete parts of an organism (under any theoretical perspective).
Although numerous concrete parts would seem to have greater intra-part as
compared to inter-part causal interaction, thereby providing the grounds for a
tight mapping, state-variable parts are not an important, common, or even
                                                  
102 Wimsatt 1974, pp. 72-74.
103 I thank Elisabeth Lloyd for extensive discussions on this part of Wimsatt's
paper.

necessarily useful tool for compositional biology104. Wimsatt further claims that
when there are strong causal interactions between state-variable parts across
theoretical perspectives, interactional complexity exists, whereas when there is
no such cross-perspective interaction, interactional simplicity exists. Wimsatt
does not clarify what allows for the measurement of cross-perspective interactions.
Presumably some meta-perspective measurement or mapping methods are
necessary. Wimsatt's account of interactional complexity is opaque.
Let us turn to comparing one aspect of Kauffman's and Wimsatt's
respective arguments. An interesting difference in their accounts of part
decomposition and mathematization of system descriptions is that for Kauffman
the two are related. A symbolic cybernetic model provides the ground for
formulating hypotheses about the appropriate causal interactions between
concrete parts. For Wimsatt the two are unrelated and are distinct ways of
representing the system. Given the history of the compositional biological
sciences examined here, I would say that Wimsatt's understanding is more
accurate. Few, if any, practitioners in compositional biology have actually
employed the "top-down" hypothesis-generation methodology that Kauffman
suggests. This is not to say that such practice is impossible, but the burden of
proof is on Kauffman, and those following his ideas, to show that such praxis can
be useful and effective in compositional biology.
Similarly to Wimsatt, Griesemer is also concerned with the overall
structure of scientific disciplines but, in addition, he is also concerned with the
                                                  
104 Although this by itself is certainly not an argument against the utility of
mathematizing certain aspects of compositional biology. Consider the work of
Kauffman 1993, von Dassow et al. 2000, Gordon et al. 1992 even if such work has
been largely ignored.

material practice of the science and the way that theoretical perspectives
"coordinate" models, protocols, and phenomena.105 In a figure (Appendix Figure
2.3) expanded from Ronald Giere's model of scientific reasoning, Griesemer
suggests that physical images are the "concrete expression of theoretical
perspectives."106  It is unclear how images can always be the expression of all
theoretical perspectives, at different levels, for all biological (or physical)
sciences, formal or compositional. Griesemer seems to be overextending his
claim, but the idea that there are mediating representations (and/or activities)
between a perspective and its models, protocols, and phenomena is a very
provocative one. Griesemer is not concerned with either the role perspectives
play in partitioning systems or in the way that systems could be represented
mathematically. His concern is to describe perspectives in a very broad and,
possibly, complete sense – a laudable goal indeed. I will now turn to my more
modest interest and comprehension of theoretical perspectives, which borrows
much from Kauffman's, Wimsatt's, and Griesemer's accounts, but also differs
from them at times.
2.2.2 My Account of Theoretical Perspectives
Phenomena, methodologies, and theories are all aspects of scientific
activity coordinated by theoretical perspectives. These activities provide answers
to the research questions deemed of interest by that perspective. This
immediately raises an interpretative problem: is a perspective the collection of all
scientific activities (including, for example, methodologies and models of various
                                                  
105 See, e.g., Griesemer 2000; Griesemer and Gerson on protocols.

84
types, as well as the activities—mental, physical, and social—linking models and
methodologies necessary to confirm the models) or is it the broad biases107 and
assumptions (some implicit and hidden) guiding all this activity? That is, is the
perspective an aggregate of the multi-level and multi-type scientific activity or
does it consist only of the biases coordinating and prescribing such activity? So,
for example, does the theoretical perspective of developmental biology include
all the details of (i) lab discussions and meetings, both to discuss progress and to
troubleshoot, (ii) implementation of specific molecular biology protocols for
particular purposes, (iii) the physical reagents and instruments, and (iv) the
general biases directing research, all four used for a particular purpose (e.g., to
determine the size of a DNA clone) or does a perspective consist, primarily, only
of the general biases directing the researcher in all these activities (e.g., "set up a
PCR/gel electrophoresis experiment to determine the size of your DNA clone")?
This is a well-known question with analogies in other fields such as
developmental biology or philosophy of mind: when attempting to explain how
a system changes over time, or even how a system works, should we focus on the
dynamics of the system as a whole, such as the developing organism or the mind-
body-action complex or should we be concerned with capacities of a few (kinds of)
parts in the system that seem to have special power either causally or
representationally (or both), such as genes or intentional states?
                                                  
107 Note that by "biases" I do not intend to imply that the assumption is devious
or reprehensible, as vernacular usage suggests. Rather, I intend to use the word
to encompass explicit and implicit, "objective" and "subjective," examined and
unexamined, high-level and low-level, deep and superficial, etc. assumptions
guiding scientific activity.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
85
I do not think that this problem has been satisfactorily addressed in either
Wimsatt's or Griesemer's work. Griesemer's image of scientific reasoning108
suggests the interpretation that perspectives are guiding assumptions. I believe
that there is an ambiguity in the term "theoretical perspective" and that,
depending on the purpose of the philosopher or sociologist of science, the term
can be used as either a descriptor of scientific activity or the biases guiding such
activity. In what follows, I will employ the term in the sense of guiding biases as
well as assumptions. For any particular perspective, such biases and
assumptions are more compact and different in kind than the sum total of
scientific activities.109
The guiding assumptions (constituting theoretical perspectives) are
distinct in kind between formal biology and compositional biology. In formal
biology, for example, assumptions govern the abstraction of simple kinds (in
particular mathematical kinds) from simple objects. Abstraction of a simple kind,
as discussed in Chapter 1, is based on very few, easily quantifiable, properties
that can be captured in relatively simple laws. In population genetics, for
example, quantities such as gene frequencies, fitnesses, and population sizes are
used in models and empirically measured. Additive or multiplicative genetic
models are based on, and provide, different assumptions guiding the theoretical
work employing such quantities.110 This example also brings forth the
hierarchical structure of perspectives, because both additive and multiplicative
                                                  
108 Griesemer 2000, p. S349, Appendix Figure 2.3.
109 These biases and assumptions also guide an "explanatory closure" between the
theoretical goals of a discipline (e.g., produce models of a certain sort, explain or
describe certain kinds of phenomena) and the methodologies for achieving such
goals. (I owe this point to Frederick Schmitt.) The guiding biases direct scientific
activity, in a discipline, in a consistent manner.

Chapter 2

86
genetic models are aspects of the single theoretical perspective of mathematical
evolutionary genetics, but they themselves constitute two different perspectives
at a more detailed level of analysis.
Furthermore, in formal biology, and in formal science such as theoretical
physics, there are relatively few distinct theoretical perspectives (e.g.,
electromagnetism and mechanics), and they often apply to different concrete
objects (e.g., charge vs. mass, and electrical vs. mechanical forces).
In compositional biology, on the other hand, the guiding assumptions of a
perspective are those that prescribe the decomposition of a system into parts. These
assumptions determine the individuation and identification of parts – that is,
they select the essential properties for partitioning the system. For example,
anatomy is guided by different assumptions than physiology in its partitioning
of a biological system. More specifically, anatomy is guided by considerations
regarding structure, whereas physiology is coordinated by assumptions
concerning process.
Furthermore, in compositional biology, there are myriad theoretical
perspectives that overlap in application to the same concrete objects (e.g.,
organisms). These perspectives, even when they pertain to the same concrete
object guide the partitioning of a system in different ways. The important
guiding assumptions in formal biology concern abstraction whereas the crucial
ones in compositional biology concern partitioning.
Now that I have delineated my use of the concept of theoretical
perspective and contrasted some of their important biases in formal biology as
compared to compositional biology, I will turn to the relationship between a
theoretical perspective and a discipline.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
87
Is a theoretical perspective111 (1) a position or a school of thought within a
discipline (e.g., Wright's Shifting Balance Theory vs. the Fisherian "Large
Population Size Theory" in mathematical evolutionary genetics112), (2) a
discipline (e.g., mathematical evolutionary genetics or comparative anatomy), or
(3) a set of disciplines grouped by some larger scale set of similarities (such as the
competition vs. integration "super-perspectives" to be discussed in Chapter 3 –
see, e.g., Diagram 3.1; and fleshed out in Winther 2003 in press)? Wimsatt further
generalizes this question when he writes "Is there a paranoid schizophrenic's
perspective? One or many? Is there a female perspective? is it cultural or
biological? is there a feminist one? …Does each new interest group or reference
group individuate a perspective or a component of a perspective? Does every
person? Does every life stage?"113 These are broad and difficult questions better
left to the psychologist and sociologist who, unlike me, has tools to address
them. But I do have some tentative answers pertinent to my analysis of
compositional biology.
First, I suggest that we can identify disciplines robustly through a variety
of means.114 There are sociological facts about how university departments and
programs are structured and often fairly robust organizations are found when
                                                  
111 In what follows, I will consistently use Wimsatt's term, although it should be
noted that Kauffman's view is basically isomorphic to Wimsatt's, as argued
above.
112 E.g., Wade and Goodnight 1998; Goodnight and Wade 2000; Coyne, Barton,
and Turelli 1997, 2000.
113 Wimsatt 1994, p. 263.
114 Sander Gliboff has pointed out some inadequacies of my account. It is
notoriously difficult to articulate identification and individuation criteria for
"disciplines." Perhaps, Gliboff suggests, it is better to refer to the theoretical
perspectives as "approaches" than to identify them with disciplines. For the
purposes of this dissertation and in the interest of receiving further insightful
critiques of these ideas, I will continue to argue that the perspectives can be
(loosely) identified, under some conditions, with disciplines.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
88
comparing universities. Furthermore, particular canonical upper-level
undergraduate and introductory graduate textbooks, in their attention to detail
and in the conceptual framework they provide, serve to identify, and further
entrench, disciplines. Third, our shared intuitions as students of science often
provide us with robust disciplinary identifications. Thus, university structure,
textbooks, and our intuitions as science scholars all provide ways for
individuating disciplines.
The six disciplines in compositional biology that I will focus on are (1)
comparative anatomy, (2) functional morphology, (3) physiology, (4)
developmental biology, (5) biochemistry, and (6) cellular biology. The first four
can be thought of as instances of "organismal biology," while the latter two can
be considered cases of "molecular biology." I choose these six disciplines because
they all relate to evolutionary developmental biology, a new discipline115 that I
will explore in more detail in the subsequent chapter. I do not therefore consider
compositional biological sciences such as immunology or neurobiology, or even
medicine, which while not necessarily a biological science, is certainly
compositional.
A single large-scale theoretical perspective, I argue, guides such
disciplines. Certainly more fine-grained theoretical perspectives, sometimes at
                                                  
115 Addressing theory change and theory novelty is beyond the scope of this
dissertation; my notion of theoretical perspective describes, primarily, a static
and stable biological science. Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is,
however, a new hybrid field and there is a historical story and a philosophical
account to be told here. I will, however, side-step this and will merely claim that
evo-devo has a set of guiding biases and assumptions that overlap with a variety
of the compositional biological sciences here described. However, the total set of
such biases in evo-devo has still to be carefully articulated, both in actual
scientific activity and in science studies. Chapter 3 is, in part, an attempt to do so
without telling a historical narrative or developing a philosophy of hybrid
theoretical perspectives.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
89
odds, exist, but these include the guiding assumptions of the disciplinary
theoretical perspective. This is why major practitioners of a discipline may
appear to disagree on almost everything, although they actually agree on many
aspects of their science.116 So here I take a stronger position that Wimsatt when he
writes, "[p]erspectives may sometimes correspond loosely to disciplines, but
need not."117 Although perspectives are hierarchically-structured, one level at
which they exist is the disciplinary one. And it is this perspective that is captured
in the canonical advanced textbook(s) of the discipline; textbooks show the
relative unity and commonality of methods, theories, and data of a discipline. In
conjunction with the idea, explored above, that theoretical perspectives
determine the mode or frame of partitioning of a system, it then follows that
textbooks capturing the disciplinary perspective provide a locus from which we
can glean the modes of partitioning endorsed by the perspective. And this allows
us to satisfy the goal of this chapter, which is to analyze the very different modes
                                                  
116 Although if two people have the same vocabulary to be able to disagree so
vehemently, this would seem to imply that they actually share many
assumptions. For example, Wade and Coyne, though differing on many issues,
certainly share, for example, a commitment to the power of mathematical
formalization as a suitable and useful representation of the evolutionary process.
They also agree on many of the basic evolutionary forces. Consider how they
both differ from a biologist, such as Goodwin (1989, 1994) or Gould (1989, 2002),
who would emphasize the importance of constraints, developmental and
phylogenetic, in the evolutionary process and who, in the case of Goodwin,
would be skeptical of the power of the sort of mathematical abstractions
presented by evolutionary genetics. Although Gould accepted the explanatory
power of population genetics for microevolution, he did believe that
microevolution alone could not explain macroevolution; and although he even
(co-)engaged in mathematical abstractions regarding macroevolution (e.g., Lloyd
and Gould 1993), his work tended to be non-formal and compositional. (I thank
Lloyd for clarifications here.) As in systematics, similarity is a matter of degree.
Disciplines, like species, can also be classified as "groups under groups" [Darwin
1859, p. 433] (although, in the case of disciplines, there is not a single "natural"
classification system).
117 Wimsatt 1994, p. 264.

of partitioning of the six different compositional biological sciences indicated
above. These differences are especially notable for the disciplines that focus on
the same system (i.e. the first four focus on the organismic level and the last two
investigate the molecular level).
For the purposes of my general analysis of different compositional
biological sciences and their corresponding frames of partitioning, textbooks are
a satisfactory source of data. I certainly accept that textbooks are simplifications of
disciplinary activity and that they engage heavily in rhetoric and self-proclaimed
authority.118 A full analysis of the theoretical perspective of any specific
discipline119, including its detailed guiding biases and assumptions, would
require both attention to other sources of data (such as research papers,
laboratory practice, communications with practitioners of the field) and more
nuanced philosophical and sociological methods.120 Furthermore, I also
understand that active practitioners of a field rarely refer to textbooks and have
certainly moved beyond them in terms of detail. But even if textbooks are the
ladders that researchers subsequently kick away121, the importance of textbooks
as a summarized collection of the scientific activity of a discipline122 and as the
                                                  
118 See, e.g., Kuhn's discussion of the role of textbooks in science in Kuhn 1970,
pp. 136-138. He claims that they are loci of authority and ignore the richness of
the history of the discipline.
119 In Chapter 3, I will investigate evolutionary developmental biology and levels
of selection theory in explicit detail using both research papers and
communications with scientists.
120 See, e.g., Latour and Woolgar 1986; Lloyd 1988.
121 I thank Melinda Fagan for this Wittgenstein-inspired way of putting the point
as she described to me her own development as a molecular biologist who
received a PhD from Stanford University.
122 Michael Wade informed me that when a potential candidate for tenure is up
for review a criterion often used in the sciences is whether that candidate's work
has made it into the advanced textbooks of the field. Thus, since textbooks
provide credibility, this suggests that they are considered important.

resource with which the next generation of practitioners learn the tools of the
trade cannot be underestimated nor should it be forgotten. It is precisely because
textbooks indicate (1) "the generally-accepted" and (2) "that which is learned
early" that I use them.
In short then, I have argued that three criteria allow us to identify
disciplines independently of knowing anything about their theoretical
perspective. Each discipline is guided by an overall theoretical perspective,
which can be gleaned from the textbooks of the discipline. One aspect of a
theoretical perspective from compositional biology is its mode of partitioning.
Different disciplines partition differently and also have other distinct guiding
assumptions as biases, as summarized in the table at the end of this chapter
[Table 3. (2.1)].
2.3 An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
I will now turn to an analysis of each of the six compositional biological
sciences in turn as motivated above. I call my analysis "empirical" from the point
of view of a philosopher of science who is using "data" of scientific practice in the
form of textbooks. That is, textbooks are one instance of scientific practice, and
they are also excellent summaries of such practice. The first four compositional
sciences belong to "organismal biology," whereas the latter two (biochemistry
and cell biology) are cases of "molecular biology." The level of investigation is
clearly different between these two clusters of theoretical perspectives.

2.3.1 Comparative Anatomy (Organismal Biology)
Comparative anatomy textbooks, such as Libbie Hyman's famous
Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy123 are organized according to structural systems
in a taxonomic context. In her first chapter she describes "general considerations
of animal form" such as those of "planes and axes," "symmetry," "metamerism or
segmentation," and "cephalization."124 Note that these are all anatomical
considerations. She also has a section in that chapter on "homology and analogy"
where she does discuss function. She even partially defines homology in terms of
"similarity or identity of specific physiological …mechanism." It is unusual to
define homology in terms of mechanism and "function,"125 but given that Hyman
claims that mechanisms indicating homology have to be extremely similar, her
assertion is not so odd. She writes, "thus an insect leg and a cat leg serve the
same broad general function, that of walking, but the mechanism of walking is
quite different in the two cases."126 So this aspect of her definition of homology is
still tied to anatomy (and common descent) in that homologous parts have to be
extremely similar to one another anatomically; they are of the same anatomical
kind. After her introductory chapter on animal form, she has a chapter on (1) the
classification of the chordates, (2) the "essential features of the lower types

124 Hyman 1942, pp. 1-4. Cephalization is the "pronounced tendency for the
anterior end of the body to become more and more distinctly separated and
differentiated from the rest of the body as a head." p. 3.
125 In this chapter, I use "function" in the sense associated with Cummins' "causal
role functions," to be described in Chapter 5. These are the current contributions
to a system behavior that structural or processual parts have. However, Hyman's
use of "function" falls fairly close to Wright's (1973) notion of a function as what
an object (or, I would add, a process) did in the past (or today) such that it
persisted under a regimen of natural selection (see also Godfrey-Smith 1993,
1996).

[chordates]," (3) the "external anatomy and adaptive radiation in gnathostomes
[jawed-vertebrates]," and (4) chordate development. These chapters employ
primarily anatomical data for their arguments. This is especially clear in (2) and
(3).
All of the remaining nine chapters concern the comparative anatomy of
distinct structural systems with their constituent parts (e.g., skeletal in four
chapters, muscular, digestive and respiratory, circulatory, urogenital, and
nervous). That is, Hyman describes each of these systems across different
chordate groups [e.g., sharks, bony fish, mudpuppy (which is an amphibian),
turtle, pigeon, cat and rabbit]. And while these nine chapters do have brief
descriptions of physiology and evolution (literally in fine print!) the focus of each
is comparative anatomy. Anatomical dissections, not measurement of dynamic
mechanisms in living organisms, are the order of the day. In fact, the book was
originally written as a laboratory manual for comparative anatomy classes, but in
her second edition she also decided "that the book shall now serve as a text as
well as a laboratory manual. It is believed that students will not need to purchase
any accompanying textbook…"127 Detailed textual descriptions of part shape,
topological relation to other parts, and part structural identity, were, in the
second edition, meant to aid the direct viewing of the dissected organism. As a
telling case of scientific bias, and of theoretical "cephalization," Hyman ends her
book with a 6-page discussion of the structure of the mammalian brain; she also
adds (in fine print) a 1-page description of the "functions of the parts of the
brain."128 That organ of the putatively greatest majesty, the mammalian brain, is

described in terms of the central theme of the book, anatomy. This book served
as a central textbook for many years.129
But, as Marvalee Wake points out in a third edition of this book, the
discipline of comparative anatomy, or "morphology" has changed. Wake writes,
"Until the early 1950s, comparative morphology emphasized the evolution of
structure alone. Since that time evolutionary morphologists have emphasized the
history of change of function (i.e., evolution) as well as of structure, for the
concept of adaptation stresses that structures change to provide functional
advantage. This book [3rd edition], then, presents, system by system, the
evolution of structure and function of vertebrates."130 For each chapter, a different
expert evolutionary morphologist was assigned to supplement and, if necessary,
change, Hyman's basic text in a manner consistent with Wake's comment.
Such a change of commitments within comparative anatomy is not,
however, universal. Goodwin certainly did not make this change.131 Baron, a less
radical comparative morphologist, also does not endorse such a move. Baron
argues against the causal efficacy of selection to explain the appearance and
developmental dynamics of variant morphologies of organisms.132 While
theoretical debate over the precise relation between selection ("function") and
morphology is ongoing, a significant amount of work in (evolutionary)
comparative anatomy today is still practiced as it was represented in Hyman's
                                                  
129 This can be gleaned from the first sentence of Marvalee Wake's "Preface to the
Third Edition," "Several generations of zoology students have used Libbie
Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy as their guide to the study of vertebrate
structure and evolution." (Wake 1979, p. ix)

while not fully endorsing them.

1942 text. This is especially true at universities with natural history museums and
at museums such as Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, the Field
Museum in Chicago, Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the
California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Comparative anatomy is an
independent theoretical perspective.
2.3.2 Functional Morphology and Physiology (Organismal Biology)
Let us now explore two very different, but related, disciplines that
partition the system, typically an organism, according to processual criteria:
functional morphology and animal physiology. As we will see, the former in
particular has aspects pertinent to formal science although I categorize it as a
compositional science. My main argument here is that these two disciplines are
concerned with processually-defined parts and interpret them in a way distinct
from comparative anatomy, even if functional morphology, similarly to
comparative anatomy, focuses on the level of gross-scale organismic structure
whereas physiology investigates a variety of organismic levels.
2.3.2.1 Functional Morphology: Basic Content
A key text in functional morphology, Functional Vertebrate Morphology, was
edited by, among others, Milton Hildebrand and David Wake. Even a cursory
glance at the table of contents reveals a completely different organization as
compared to Hyman's book. The book chapters, each written by a different
expert, are primarily activities: "Walking and Running," "Jumping and Leaping,"

"Swimming," "Ventilation," and "Feeding Mechanisms of Lower Tetrapods."133
This is very different from Hyman's organization around structural systems of
the organism.
Let us examine some of the salient characteristics of the theoretical
perspective of functional morphology, as represented in this book. First, many of
the chapters provide a classification of the different types of activities under their
purview. For example, in a chapter on swimming, the authors differentiate
between axial undulatory propulsors (e.g., fish that use their body or hind fin to
undulate through the water), and appendage propulsors. This last category is
further subdivided into undulatory (such as mantarays, which undulate their
huge fins in a direction orthogonal to the direction of motion) and oscillatory
(such as all amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals that jerk their appendages
through the water).134 Classifying the numerous relevant processes is an
important first step in the complex and detailed compositional science of
functional morphology.
In functional morphology, parts are identified in two different ways. First,
activities are subdivided into distinct activity-parts. For example, Bramble and Wake,
in their chapter entitled "Feeding Mechanisms of Lower Tetrapods," partition the
process of feeding into body movement, head thrusting, tongue projection,
mastication (if present), and swallowing.135 The first three can be either (activity-
)parts, in "generalized predators [that] frequently combine all three tactics in a
                                                  
133 Hildebrand et al., 1985. One telling exception is a chapter on "The Vertebrate
Eye"; I think this is yet another case of theoretical cephalization or what some call
"ocular discourse" – the brain and the eye are considered unique and crucial
parts of the organism, and, as such, are theoretically privileged.

single predatory act"136 or kinds, in cases where specialized predators rely, for
example, primarily on tongue projections (in salamanders, anurans, and
chameleons). In such a case a concrete activity-part can become a stand-in, a name
(e.g., HLP – hyolingual projection137), for a type of behavior when that activity-
part constitutes a significant portion of the entire behavior. This is sort of
nominalization is based on a part of a process. In many of the other chapters of
the Hildebrand et al. book, activities are also divided into their processual
components.
The second way parts are individuated is by using behavioral activity criteria
instead of the anatomical criteria used in Hyman's text. Processually-
individuated structural parts, and groupings of parts, are identified according to
what they do. For example, Hildebrand depicts the leg as a unit that undergoes
movement and Bramble and Wake unite a variety of muscles and bones into
particular groups in their representation of feeding behaviors.138 In comparative
anatomy (e.g., Hyman 1942), muscles and bones are not grouped together. In
functional morphology, however, activity determines (structural) part
individuation and identification.
Functional morphology, as represented in this textbook, uses (1) parts of
processes as well as (2) structural parts identified by their integrated role in
processes. The former is a partitioning of an activity, the latter is a structural
                                                  
136 Ibid, p. 252.
137 Ibid, p. 252.
138 This grouping of structural subparts to make a unit, which is then part of some
larger unit, can be seen especially in Hildebrand's diagrams of animal cartoons in
motion and an idealized diagram of a leg in motion (Hildebrand 1985a, pp. 39,
41, 46); it can also be seen in a diagram entitled "the mechanism of intraoral
transport in the model generalized tetrapod" in Bramble and Wake's chapter (p.
238), Appendix Figures 2.4-2.7.

partitioning according to processual considerations. This is very different from
the purely structural partitioning found in comparative anatomy, represented by
Hyman's textbook.
Before we move to physiology, it is necessary to discuss the role of
mathematics in functional morphology, especially in view of my claim that this
biological science is a compositional science. In so far as it explicitly models a
biological system using mathematical models imported from physics or
engineering, does it also become a formal science?
2.3.2.2 Functional Morphology: Model-Types
This is not an easy question to answer. In order to attempt to answer it, I
will turn to a brief description of three model-types frequently used in functional
morphology: diagrammatic and scale models, narrative models, and
mathematical models.139
Diagrammatic and scale mechanical models are ubiquitous in functional
morphology. A paper in a 1960 symposium volume on "Models and Analogues
in Biology" describes a variety of mechanical models including a depiction of the
vertebrate hind limb as a contraption involving a carriage on a rail and various
rods, springs, and axels (Appendix Figure 2.8). This same paper notes that "all
mechanical devices can be broken down into two elementary systems – levers
and wheels," and thus many functional morphological systems can be
represented, physically or diagrammatically, in this way.140 Papers in the
                                                  
139 A more complete explication of model-types will be found in Chapter 4.

Hildebrand et al. text also describe concrete141 mechanical scale models. Such
models contain parts as explicit components. Since they are idealized, these
models are incomplete for a variety of reasons: (1) there are scaling non-
isomorphisms, (e.g., length and volume scale in different powers), (2) the model
materials differ from the actual biological materials and may not be
representative of the actual physical properties such as elasticity, tensile strength,
and density, (3) not every bone and muscle is represented through rods and
springs – some are omitted from the model142, and (4) heterogeneities, within and
between individuals, in muscle and bone structure, energy demands and
supplies, etc. are not represented.  Thus, these concrete mechanical models are
impoverished idealizations. They do, however, refer directly to the compositional
nature of the system being represented.
Narrative models in functional morphology are linguistic representations
of the stage-like nature of activity. For example, Bramble and Wake provide a
narrative model of chewing. They divide chewing into a series of opening and
closing phases at two different speeds, fast and slow. They define each of these
phases with (1) the movement of different parts of the body (e.g., head and neck,
mandible, and skull) and (2) the activation of different muscle groups.143 Other
series-of-stages narrative models are presented in the chapter on ventilation and,
to a lesser extent, in the chapter on digging of quadrupeds.144 Narrative models
                                                  
141 As opposed to abstract.
142 Recall the general discussion in Chapter 1 of buffering as, under one
interpretation (not Gerson's), one form of abstraction.

more detail in Chapter 4.

are especially common in the recounting of history, biological or human.145 In
human history it is difficult to empirically evaluate narrative models due to their
intrinsic "multi-perspectivality," the unknowable intentions of the human agents
making history, and the complexity of conditions. In functional morphology, in
contrast, there are concrete objects to which we can and do turn to verify the
models. Thus, narrative models in functional morphology can be empirically
evaluated146 more readily than such models in history. These models, of course,
are also highly idealized in that they are an abstraction and do not exactly
represent the system and its parts. Through language they do, however,
explicitly refer to concrete parts, and changes in them; they are thus models
pertinent to compositional biology. Ideally, the representation of an organism
through functional morphology would most readily occur through a
combination of models such as narrative models and scale models.
Mathematical biological models, as discussed in Chapter 1, are also an
undeniably important model-type in functional morphology. Mathematical
models are used to model dynamic activities such as swimming or the properties
of body support,147 and are an integral aspect of that discipline. In the case of
swimming, a large number of diverse formulas and parameters (Appendix
Figures 2.9, 2.10) are used to represent different forms of swimming such as
undulatory and oscillatory propulsion; the fundamental distinction between
these two is that in the former case the moving entity (body or fin) moves
smoothly and in the same direction as the whole body whereas, for the latter,

146 All within the framework of having chosen one's position vis-à-vis the
inevitable trade-offs between, for example, generality, precision, accuracy, and
simplicity, as we shall see in Chapters 4 and 5.
147 E.g., Alexander 1985; Webb and Blake 1985; Vogel 1988.

Chapter 2

101
motion causes drag and is discontinuous with motion of the body. The equations
used for the two cases are remarkably different, the equations of the former case
involve primarily parameters describing smooth reactive forces on the body by
the water whereas those of the latter one entail parameters describing both
(discontinuous) drag of the appendage on the water and thrust that provides a
torque force on the body. 148 Different mechanisms of movement entail very
different mathematical representations. In the case of body support, multiple
parameters represent the forces involved, angles of bones and tendons, tensile
strength of the biological materials, cross-sectional area of bone, elastic
deformations, etc.149
Complex engineering formulas stemming from fluid dynamics and
structural engineering are thus ubiquitous in functional morphology. Sometimes
situations, however, are too complex for models to be formulated: "Some detailed
hydromechanical models for oscillating lifting surfaces have been developed, but
none has as yet been applied to swimming animals, partly because of their
complexity."150 Furthermore, the compositional organization of the system is
intimately appealed to in these models, even if mathematical abstraction
idealizes away from within-organism and among-organism (of the same species)
variation.  Thus, these mathematical methods serve a different role than those
ubiquitous in, and even defining of, formal biology. In this latter kind of biology,

the mathematical parameters are highly abstract, referring to a few simple
properties, many of which are statistical aggregate measures (e.g., fitness).151
2.3.2.3 Physiology
Physiology provides a more processual and activity-oriented outlook than
functional morphology. In the latter, behaviors are still intimately connected to
morphological, gross-scale structures such as organs, whereas in the former,
activities are related to a variety of levels. Furthermore, the environment external
to the organism is considered more explicitly in physiology, at least in part
because the environment is perceived as a disturbing force against which
physiology confers organismic homeostasis.
One set of physiology textbooks, Eckert et al.'s Animal Physiology152 and
Hoar's General and Comparative Physiology153, revolve around activities, as can be
seen from their chapter titles: "Enzymes and Energetics," "Propagation and
Transmission of Signals," "Exchange of Gases," and "Feeding, Digestion, and
Absorption" in the former, and "Homeostatic Mechanisms," "Receptor
Mechanisms," "Nutrition and Digestion," and "Excretion" in the latter. Note that
these activities span a variety of levels and parts seen as distinct in Hyman 1942
as well as Hildebrand et al. 1985. Here I want to provide descriptions of the
presentations of molecular, nervous, and gas exchange activity.
                                                  
151 Furthermore, as we shall see in Chapters 4 and 5, the equations of formal
biology, which produce "transition theories" (sensu Cummins 1983), are easily
amenable to semantic view analysis.

Molecules are described from the point of view of their role in dynamic
metabolic pathways, many of which are circular never-ending closed loops such
as the Krebs cycle. Structural diagrams of molecules are, of course, provided, but
the flow of the cycle, which produces ATP, is emphasized using arrows between
intermediary products and tallying numbers of ATP molecules produced.
Furthermore, a small section on "oxygen debt" emphasizes both the multi-level
impact, and description thereof, of molecular activity on animal tissue (Appendix
Figure 2.11).154
Nervous signals are also described as central agents in depictions of
nervous system activity. Diagrams of structures that produce them are only one
aspect of the diagrammatic and narrative models that represent the activity of
these signals. Simple circuit diagrams, flow charts of sequential activity, and
electrical intensity graphed as a function of time all capture activity of nervous
signals (Appendix Figures 2.12, 2.13).155
In considering the process of gas exchange, a variety of models are
employed to describe it. Schematic diagrams represent the exchange of different
gases between different organs, tissues, cells, or even molecules (e.g., lung and
circulatory system at different levels, or hemoglobin) as well as schematic
diagrams of particular properties (e.g., pressure) at particular locations (i.e.,
parts) of the process. Graphs showing lung volume as a function of time indicate
the different component phases of breathing. A mathematical graph indicates the
roughly linear relationship between lung area and body weight in different
species. Formulas relate rates of gas transfer to such variables as diffusion

distance and concentration difference across the membrane. Again the activity
and process of gas exchange is emphasized in all these representations
(Appendix Figures 2.14-2.18).156
Many kinds of parts are present in the processually-oriented image of
nature presented by physiology. First of all, activities are broken up into activity-
parts157 such as the component activities of cell respiration (including glycolysis
and the Krebs cycle), or the various components of nerve activity (including
stimulation and refractory period), or even the various stages of breathing
through expansion and contraction of the lung. The activity is divided into
temporal segments according to individuation criteria that state that the different
segments are different in kind from each other (e.g., glycolysis is different from the
Krebs cycle).
There are also the parts that could be thought of as the agents of the
activity, rather than as segments of the activity. These are the structures, such as
molecules or organs, which engage in the process. Note, though that these parts
are not necessarily defined structurally. That is, processual considerations such
as the capacity of a structure to engage in certain activities are used to identify the
relevant parts of a system. For example, the heart would be considered a blood
pump in the circulatory system in which the right atrium and ventricle are
involved in moving deoxygenated blood, whereas the left atrium and ventricle
move oxygenated blood (Appendix Figure 2.17). From a structural point of view,
all four heart chambers are integrated in a single organ, but from a processual
point of view, the right side is engaged in a different, though related, activity –
                                                  
156 Eckert et al. 1988, Chapter 14. See also Hoar 1983, Chapter 13.
157 This same classificatory partitioning process is done in functional morphology,
as described above with the example of hyolingual projection.

Chapter 2

105
the two sides are, if one were to draw a physiological flow chart separated in
activity, with the lungs in between.
Another set of physiology textbooks, Willmer et al.'s Environmental
Physiology of Animals158 as well as Schmidt-Nielsen's Animal Physiology159 also
organize their analysis in terms of activities. But, they add another crucial aspect,
the environment. Wilmer et al.'s book, for example, includes a whole section
entitled "Coping with the Environment" in which they discuss the problems
posed by environments, such as marine, fresh water, and terrestrial habitats.
They also have a section on parasitic habitats. For each of these chapters, they
discuss how physiological processes (e.g., maintenance of water balance) address
the particular problem posed by that environment. Similarly, Schmidt-Nielsen's
text is explicitly environmentally-oriented. Instead of focusing on habitat-types,
he presents a problem-orientation reflected in the division of his text into five parts
that addresses how animals acquire and maintain: (1) oxygen, (2) food and
energy, (3) temperature, (4) water, and (5) movement, information, and
integration. He organizes different physiological activities under each of these
categories of problem. Both Schmidt-Nielsen's and Willmer et al.'s organization
provides an explicit way to tie function to process (rather than focus exclusively
on process). That is, particular processes are here understood as solving
environmental problems – processes have specific functions. As I will show in
Chapter 4, process is not the same as function, even if the two are related.
Let us summarize how parts are pertinent to functional morphology and
physiology. What sorts of parts, as represented in their textbooks, do these fields

employ? How do these theoretical perspectives partition a system? Parts of a
process, and processually-defined structural parts (i.e., the agents of the process)
are the two important (very abstract) kinds of processually-defined parts.
Although I do not claim that biologists explicitly differentiate between these
parts or even self-consciously employ one or both in their work, I argue that
these parts are implicitly employed in most of the classificatory, representational,
and explanatory practices of processually-oriented compositional biology such as
physiology and functional morphology. Almost any representation or
explanation stemming from these fields can be shown to consist of process
partitioning. Differently put, the theoretical perspectives of physiology and
functional morphology partition a system processually.
2.3.3 Developmental Biology (Organismal Biology)
The parts pertinent to developmental biology are of a different type
altogether. The concern here is with the construction, over ontogenetic history, of
the organism160. The parts appealed to in explanations of the ontogenetic process
are molecular genes161 acting over ontogenetic time, regions of developmental
activity such as endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, as well as dynamic signaling
processes such as cell signaling activities and morphogenetic gradients. I will
discuss this discipline in more detail in Chapter 3. As a theoretical perspective,
the parts appealed to in its explanations and descriptions are parts that both (1)
                                                  
160 Or, as we shall see in Chapter 3, on higher-level integrated systems such as
social insect colonies.
161 These molecular genes are exactly what Moss 2002 calls "genes-D."

change over developmental time162 and (2) are involved in causing such
change163.
Again, a brief exploration of the standard contemporary textbook on this
topic, Gilbert's Developmental Biology164, will serve my purposes. Three important
aspects of development can be inferred from this text's detailed table of contents.
The organization mixes ontogenetic history (early to late) and organizational
levels (molecular to organismic), two crucial aspects of development. Although
there is a clear developmental temporal narrative component to the text's
structure, there is also a clear switching among different levels (e.g., molecules,
                                                  
162 This is one way in which the parts are complex.
163 I sidestep the issue of distributed cause here. I am extremely sympathetic to
the view articulated in the work of Lewontin, Oyama, and others on the topic of
extended and distributed developmental cause (and multiple developmental
causal "agents", although the investigators mentioned would probably not be
satisfied with the reification of distributed causes into agents). But while my
philosophical proclivities lie in that direction, my scientific pragmatism suggests
to me a "naturalizing" move that resists such proclivities. That is, if I am to
naturalize my analysis in scientific practice, I will probably have to abandon
many of the points adumbrated by the distributed-cause-during-development
advocates. Developmental biology practice does tend to be "reductionist" in
general even if there are ways to be simultaneously a "holist" and a
"reductionist," as exemplified by the work of Raff and Wagner (e.g., Raff 1996;
Wagner 2000; Wagner et al. 2000). For now I would prefer to set aside conflicting
philosophical and scientific pulls and simply provide an analysis that is
independent of commitments to holism or reductionism.
On a related note, Frederick Schmitt pointed out to me that there is a clear
tension between the philosophical views emphasizing distributed cause and
compositional organization, respectively. The more distributed cause we have,
the less compositional organization there can be, and vice-versa. Thus, there is
some tension in my philosophical views where I would like to emphasize both.
But Lewontin and Levins also have this tension in their dialectical view, in which
they also focus on both! By sidestepping the whole issue of distributed cause I
will leave the resolution of this tension for future work. [However, in Chapter 5, I
will also briefly note that the explanatory pattern advocated by Cummins, while
accurate for compositional biology, is a "reductionist" way to flesh out
explanation in this form of biology – other alternatives could perhaps exist.]

cells, and organs). Third, the effect of the environment is minimized in the text,
i.e., normal development is context-independent.
Let us turn to the first two points. The book is divided into five sections.
After an introductory section addressing basic concepts, techniques, and levels,
there are sections on "Patterns of [early] Development," "Mechanisms of Cellular
Differentiation," "Specification of Cell Fate and the Embryonic Axes," and
"Cellular Interactions During Organ Formation." Note that there is a clear
historical direction through these sections, from the early stages of development
(with chapters on cleavage, gastrulation, and early axonal specificity165) through
the middle stages (with chapters on cell fate specification through cell-cell
interactions, and the establishment of body axes in mammals and birds166) and
culminating167 in the formation of organs, which are the key parts of adult
morphology (with chapters on secondary induction, the tetrapod limb, and
                                                  
165 Chapters 5, 6, and 8 respectively.
166 Chapters 15 and 16 respectively.
167 It is of some interest to note that developmental processes, which can be
captured in narrative models, do not develop the narrative tensions present in
human narratives, such as plays or novels. That is, there are no dramatic
elements that build up and, subsequently, require resolution. There is no easing
of dramatic tension. That is why I use terms like "culminating" ironically, to note
important differences between biological processes and human creations.
Despite efforts by some philosophers and scientists to note continuities of all
kinds between the biological and social worlds, these putative near-isomorphic
analogies fail repeatedly and we should constantly be alert to the crucial
discontinuities between biology and sociology.  We should not fall prey to the
traps set by the explanations of the sociobiologists, evolutionary epistemologists,
or, even, those set by the more benign analogies, advocated even here in my
dissertation, of commonalities of representational and explanatory resources in
the biological and social sciences, such as narrative models (e.g., the work of
Hull, Richards and Griesemer). We must always be vigilant about suggested
similarities, in representations of the biological and the social, which can be used
both for misrepresenting nature (although, who determines what a
"misrepresentation" is?) and for oppressive social purposes.

hormones as long-distance mediators of development168). This is a developmental
historical narrative.169 The parts instantiating structure and process at a particular
time as well as those (same or different kinds of) parts causing the structure and
process of subsequent stages are the parts involved in this narrative.
This is an important distinction that does not exist in the other two
processual organismic compositional biological sciences, functional morphology
and physiology. Developmental biology strongly emphasizes the distinction
between those parts that are the sources, causes, and agents of change (especially
"genes-D," as described in Moss's work) and those parts that instantiate or are
involved in the change, such as developmental regions (e.g., endoderm,
mesoderm, and ectoderm). There is a clear hierarchical causal divide in this
discipline; it represents and explains how change from one level (molecular,
especially genetic) to another (especially adult morphology) happens. This causal
divide has been the subject of many metaphors (e.g., the gene as a homunculus
containing the "representation" or "program" of the whole organism) and much
philosophical critique.170 Due to the absence of this clear and drastic hierarchical
causal divide in the other two theoretical perspectives of functional morphology
and physiology, this distinction is not important for them; in these cases the
agents (that is, causes) of change are the same units as those involved in the
change.
                                                  
168 Chapters 17, 18, and 19 respectively.
169 Note that the processual narratives of development are directional ("time's
arrow"), whereas the processual narratives of physiology are circular in the sense
both of homeostatic cycles and metabolic cycles ("time's cycle").
170 Again, while I am sympathetic to the philosophical literature, it is also clear to
me that most biologists believe in this causal divide. And since my articulation of
compositional biology is naturalized in the theories and methodologies of
biologists, I will not address the philosophical literature here.

Chapter 2

The narrative models of developmental biology, and the parts pertaining
to the models, exist at various levels here. For example, the section on mechanisms
of cellular differentiation concerns transcriptional and translational regulation of
gene expression through, in the former case, activation of promoters (Chapter 10)
or chromatin (Chapter 11) or, in the latter case, differential RNA processing and
translation (Chapter 12). In other words, there is a temporal sequence of
molecular events during which regulation can occur by virtue of changing
reaction timing and intensity. This, in turn, causes cellular differentiation (that is,
producing difference from sameness). But cellular (e.g., cell signaling, Chapters 15
and 17) and histological (e.g., primary and secondary induction, Chapters 17 and
18) levels are also examined as regions and agents of cellular differentiation. That
is, developmental changes and developmental causes at higher levels are
considered valid and potent.171 Thus, the parts that figure in developmental
explanations exist at a variety of levels, from regulating molecules to inductive
tissues.
Let us now turn to the third point, the point that environmental influences
are downplayed. Developmental biology is typically considered an "internalist"
field in which internal processes, guided or self-determined, are described.172 The
work of Brian Goodwin or Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela are two
extreme versions of this view of developmental biology.173 The "self-

determination" of the genetic program is also potentially part of this argument,
though for the three authors just mentioned it certainly is not since they believe,
in different ways, that morphogenetic fields or homeostatic processes provide
internal regulation and use genes as mere resources. The views of these three
authors also make clear an important point: an understanding of organisms as
compositionally-structured (as opposed to an extreme "distributed cause" view) does not
require a gene-centric position. Others, however, consider development an
internally-driven process precisely because the genetic sequence is internal to the
organism and potent in its development.174 Gilbert's book also endorses this
assumption by having to set aside a chapter entitled "Environmental regulation
of animal development" rather than keeping that discussion integrated with the
rest of the book. Developmental biology as a field relies on the idea of
development as a self-organizing or, more commonly, as an organized-by-genes,
process of part construction.
                                                  
174 See, for example, Lewis Wolpert's work in which he discusses whether the egg
is computable (Wolpert 1994). A passage from a book chapter entitled "Ex DNA
Omnia" will make the point: "The power of DNA lies in its containing both the
instructions for making all the proteins in the cell, and the programme which
controls their synthesis." (Wolpert 1991, p. 77) Others have since promulgated,
even putatively "proven," Wolpert's view to be "correct." (See, e.g., Portin et al.
1998). Mayr's distinction between proximal and ultimate causation also relies on
this notion.
Again, there is cogent criticism of this position by Keller, Lewontin, Moss,
Oyama, among others, who emphasize the distributed cause view. Again, I
appeal to biological practice, which promulgates internal drive in development,
although I certainly wish to distance myself from the extreme gene-centrism of
someone like Wolpert.

2.3.4 Intermezzo: On Organismal Biology and Molecular Biology as
Clusters of Disciplines
Now that we have explored the guiding biases, in particular with respect
to criteria of partitioning, of the theoretical perspectives of organismal biology, I
would like to sketch how molecular biology can be considered a compositional
biology. The various theoretical perspectives of molecular biology have not
received sufficient philosophical attention175, particularly considering their
economic, medical, and social relevance. Here I only begin to do justice to
molecular biology as a, primarily, compositional biology consisting of theoretical
perspectives such as biochemistry and cell biology.
A way in which molecular biology has received some philosophical
attention is in its relationship with organismal biology, which is considered a
relationship of theoretical reduction.176 I side with those that argue against the
actuality, or even possibility, of a reduction relation from organismal biology to
molecular biology. The diversity and richness of scientific practice, including that
of the independent theoretical perspectives of organismal biology, indicates that
no such theoretical reduction exists and is not likely to be achieved. The spread
of molecular techniques to and in organismal biology is not theoretical reduction;
it is not even methodological reduction in that even those molecular methods are
employed for theories (problem and question framings as well as models)
intrinsic to that higher-level organismal biological science and some of the
methods, such as dissection and transplantation still pertain strictly to
                                                  
175 Although see, for example Culp and Kitcher 1989; Moss 2002; Schaffner 1980,
1993.
176 See the work of Nagel and Schaffner. For criticisms on these points see, e.g.,
Culp and Kitcher 1989; Kitcher 1984; Sarkar 1998; Fagan 2002.

organismal biology.177  I want to avoid further discussion of theoretical, or other
kinds of, reduction. What I want to address is whether, and if so how, the two
bona fide theoretical perspectives of molecular biology that I will explore,
biochemistry and cell biology, partition their system of study.
My argument concerning different guiding biases (including criteria of
partitioning) works best in the compositional science cluster of organismal
biology where there is a complex and hierarchical system, the organism, that is
decomposed in many different kinds of ways. In discussing organismal biology, I
did not explicitly describe how these theoretical perspectives investigated
complex objects, employed complex abstraction, although I did indicate how
they used either a variety of model types and, of course, referred explicitly to the
concrete part-whole organization of the organism. It seems evident that these
sciences do focus on complex objects in that the parts of organisms have many
dispositional properties and have complex histories, developmental and
evolutionary alike, that are relevant to determining those properties (e.g., organs
of the same kind in related clades have different kinds of properties). Pertinent to
complex abstraction, (1) consistent hierarchically-organized intensional sets of
these numerous dispositional properties can be captured by particular theoretical
perspectives, of which there are many, (2) once the relevant intensional sets has
been captured by the perspective, there are many kinds (at numerous
hierarchical levels) of objects in the theoretical perspective, and (3) there are
                                                  
177 Presenting the different definitions of "reductionism" is beyond the scope of
this dissertation. Sarkar presents five different meanings of the term, premised
on issues surrounding approximations and spatial and abstraction hierarchies
(Sarkar 1998, 43 ff.). Zucker distinguishes eight senses, including "ontological,"
"mathematical," "mechanical," and "methodological" reductionism (Zucker 1996,
pp. 23-26).

Chapter 2

114
many ways that different complex objects can belong to the same complex kind
(i.e., particular properties can be present in some objects and absent in other
objects of that kind).178 So, for example, eyes and livers can be described under
many perspectives, as we have seen, and a fair amount of intra-species and inter-
species variation can be accommodated in theoretically-useful intensional sets
(constituting the complex kind) of these kinds.
The story of part decomposition is not so complex in molecular biology.
There is not a single integrated "molecular system" to decompose in various
ways there. Part of the reason for this is that, in a trivial sense, the organism is
indeed composed of "nothing but" molecules and diverse kinds of reactions,
which are the "elemental parts" of biological systems. Put differently, there are no
radically different ways of partitioning the same kind of molecule, or molecular
pathway. In molecular biology, structure, process, and function are closely
related and radically different spatio-temporal decompositions of molecules and
molecular reactions do not happen when we turn from, say, a structural to a
processual perspective. That is why, as I will show, biochemistry includes all
these perspectives. There is no radical relativism of perspective-dependent part
decomposition in molecular biology as there is in organismal biology. Rather, the
variety of perspectives in molecular biology has to do with level of analysis (such
as molecular vs. cellular).
                                                  
178 As we saw in Chapter 1, in formal biology, there are few theoretical
perspectives, few kinds of objects within a perspective, and rigorous ways for
objects to be described by a particular simple kind.

2.3.5 Biochemistry (Molecular Biology)
Biochemistry is a compositional biology at a particular level rather than of
a particular set of structures or processes or functions.179 In this way, it differs in
an interesting way from the other four compositional organismal biological
sciences thus far considered. Stryer's book is divided into 6 overarching sections,
all but the last, pertaining to phenomena at the molecular level. The last one
concerns the "interaction of [molecular] information, conformation, and
metabolism in physiological processes."180 Even in this final section, molecular
phenomena are the operative representations and explanations. Biochemistry is a
science that focuses on a particular level rather than on a particular, broadly
construed, cause, such as structure (comparative anatomy) or process (temporal
– developmental biology; atemporal "homeostasis" – physiology), as the other
compositional sciences explored above are. This is confirmed by looking at the
second section on proteins. This section of the text explores protein
"conformation, dynamics, and function"181 – these correspond, respectively, to
structure, process, and function.
In biochemistry there are many different kinds of structural parts acting in
the processes it describes [see, e.g., Section I ("Molecular Design of Life") and
Section IV ("Biosynthesis of Macromolecular Precursors") of Stryer's text]. At the
most general level, there are four basic kinds of molecules: nucleotides, proteins,
carbohydrates, and lipids. But these kinds are not simple and categorical as is
                                                  
179 I do not here consider the relation of biochemistry to organic (or even
inorganic) chemistry. This is, of course, an important question and a full analysis
of biochemistry as a compositional biology "under" the disciplinary cluster of
molecular biology is required.
180 Stryer 1988, p. viii.
181 Stryer 1988, p. vii.

evidenced by the existence of glycolipids (carbohydrate and lipid molecules) and
glycoproteins (carbohydrate and protein molecules), both of which are key
components of cell membranes, as well as by transfer RNA, which is a nucleotide
sometimes activated with a signature amino acid. Thus even at the most abstract
level, the categories of structural parts are fluid and complex, consistent with
complex abstraction being characteristic of compositional biology.
As the level of analysis becomes increasingly concrete, the types of parts
increase dramatically in number. Furthermore, there is much flexibility in the
intensional set of properties pertinent to a molecule or molecule-kind when
considered as an instance of a certain more general kind. For example, as long as
a molecule performs a certain function, e.g., decarboxylation, it can have a broad
variety of structures (i.e., the intensional set covering that function is flexible
with respect to structural properties). Conversely, a specific molecule can also
serve a variety of functions (e.g., acetyl CoA is a precursor to the Krebs cycle and
to the production of cholesterol; see Appendix Figure 4.11), and thus the
intensional set of the structural properties of that molecule would also include a
variety of functional properties. Note also that my discussion points to the fact
that the objects of biochemistry are complex (my first distinction between the two
kinds of biology) since they involve many causes (i.e., multiple functions and
processes, as well as a complex structure).
Stryer's text is replete with diagrams capturing the molecular agents at
different stages of reaction. Thus, molecules serve as parts (structural and
processual) in multiple reactions. They can be interpreted as the agents involved
in, and causing, change. Their function is explained by their biochemical

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
117
properties.182 Furthermore, biochemical processes can be partitioned into stages,
such as the three stages of cellular respiration or the stages of gene expression
(i.e., most generally, transcription and translation).
Biochemistry is a detail-oriented science with many kinds of parts.
Abstract principles and general statements about processes or functions of
structures are difficult to come by in that field. All of the following have
exceptions: (1) Crick's central dogma (information flows from DNA to RNA to
proteins), (2) the universality of the genetic code and (3) the universality of the
processes of cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Such exceptions include: (1)
reverse transcription and, perhaps some proposed mechanisms for adaptive
mutations in bacteria, (2) the genetic code of mitochondria, (3) the existence of
different alternative respiratory pathways, such as aerobic and anaerobic
(including fermentation and lactic acid production), and different pathways of
carbon fixation during photosynthesis, such as C3, C4, and CAM plants. There are
multiple exceptions to the crucial generalizations in molecular biology, but we
would still, for example, call all the different pathways of carbon fixation (parts
of) "photosynthesis." Thus, biochemistry is aptly characterized as possessing
complex ("Wittgenstein-Boyd") abstraction. The kinds of parts, whether they be
structures, processes, or functions of molecular biology are complex kinds
despite clear regularities in biochemical properties at very basic part-levels, such
as functional groups.
                                                  
182 As I will specifically show in Chapter 5, when I discuss Cummins' notion of
causal capacities.

2.3.6 Cellular Biology (Molecular Biology)
I now briefly turn to cellular biology, another key area in molecular
biology.183 Similar to biochemistry, cellular biology is a compositional biology
focusing on a specific level, the cellular one. Again, it includes structural,
processual, and functional considerations. Alberts et al.'s book is divided into
four general sections: "Introduction to the Cell," "Molecular Genetics," "Internal
Organization of the Cell," and "Cells in Their Social Context."184 The cell is the lens
through which the book is structured. For example, the structure of
chromosomes and the role of the cell nucleus are considered in one chapter as a
way to conceptually frame DNA replication as well as RNA synthesis and
processing, while discussion of proteins as "machines" that do work necessary to
the cell is taken up in another chapter.185 Furthermore, enzymes are not
considered in a separate chapter on the biochemistry of respiration, say, but are
rather discussed in a chapter focusing primarily on the cellular loci of energy
conversion, mitochondria and chloroplasts.186 Gene expression and development
are also considered in terms of cellular differentiation.187 It is clear that the cell,
rather than molecules, is the focal point of this book.
                                                  
183 There is some legitimate concern about whether cellular biology should be
characterized as a molecular biology (Melinda Fagan, pers. comm.). In part, I
appeal to historical and sociological facts regarding the structure of this
discipline as compared to, say developmental biology, which had its origin as an
organismal biological science. I also appeal to the intuition that cellular biology is
much more closely tied to molecular structure, process, and function compared
to developmental biology.

The book explores the structure, processes, and functions of cells. For
example, it explores both the structure of the cell membrane and the processual
transport of small molecules and macromolecules across it.188 It explores one
important structure maintaining the integrity of the cell, the cytoskeleton, as well
as the mechanisms and timing involved in making more cells.189 Structures and
processes are both emphasized in the models and explanations of the book.
Functions, of molecular activity, pertinent to the larger system—cells—are
constantly emphasized.190

Cummins' framework of compositional and functional explanation to be
explicated in Chapter 5.

different aspects of parts for different theoretical perspectives. The first four
columns are cases of organismal biology.
In this table, I have tried to capture examples and assumptions about parts
for the theoretical perspective constituting each discipline. The theoretical
perspectives are the columns of the table. The first row provides examples of
parts studied in each discipline. Concrete examples are given (e.g., bones or
hormones) as well as general kinds of examples (e.g., activity parts, of which one
example, under molecular biology, is glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative

phosphorylation – the three parts of cellular respiration). Note that the
distinction between (1) parts involved in an activity and (2) parts causing an
activity exists only in developmental biology, as discussed above in section 3.C.
Note that in the last entry of each cell for the first row, I have provided
names to the kinds of "modules" (parts) that I think are important for that
theoretical perspective.191 The names are provisional and even ambiguous. For
example, in the case of purely process-oriented perspectives, such as functional
morphology, physiology, and developmental biology, there is an ambiguity
about what "processual" part—named, more specifically, a "module" for each
perspective—means. The parts involved in, and causing the, activities studied by
each perspective are identified using processual criteria (i.e., the intensional sets
defining kinds of parts in each theoretical perspective contain criteria pertinent
to process, as characterized by that perspective). For example, developmental
biology defines regions such as endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm in terms of
what they do, whereas physiology defines systems and parts thereof in terms of
their role, for example, in maintaining homeostasis. But the process itself (e.g.,
gastrulation rather than the cells and regions involved in gastrulation) is also
divided into stages (e.g., invagination at various phases) – there are activity parts.
Thus, "processual" part includes both (1) processually-defined parts involved in,
and causing the, activity and (2) activity parts. A better nomenclature could be
provided.
Whereas the first row provides examples of parts, the second row states
the criteria constituting the theoretical perspective's "partitioning frame." A
partitioning frame is the set of biases and assumptions that describe the way that
                                                  
191 See also Winther 2001.

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
123
a discipline carves up the system under study into parts. In compositional
biology, such frames are extremely important. They, of course, also rely on
abstraction – kinds of parts and models concerning parts need to be delineated
and elaborated, even if not explicitly, in order to provide content to the frame.
But the referents of these frames, are fundamentally, concrete parts.
The entries in each cell of the second row under each perspective are
intended to be general. The functions—capacities requiring explanation—of
functional morphology and physiology are different since the explananda are
different in those two fields. In functional morphology, the capacity concerns
gross-scale external behaviors such as locomotion and feeding, whereas in
physiology, they are pertinent to dynamic internal states (often involving
molecular activity) such as homeostasis.
In the last row I mention some of the general biases pertinent to each of
the theoretical perspectives: (1) general object of study, (2) experimentation
methods, (3) model-types employed, and (4) general inferences that are desired
and justified. Partitioning criteria are also biases, but these are given in the row
above. There are many other guiding biases, but the four kinds I delineate help to
capture much of the structure, method, and purpose of a theoretical perspective.
Table 3. (2.1), then, helps to clarify how different theoretical perspectives
pertinent to each discipline of compositional biology investigate parts.

2.4 Conclusions: The Complexity and Relativity of Organismal Biology
In this chapter, I have shown that a variety of compositional biological
sciences investigate (1) complex objects using (2) complex abstraction and (3)
material and propositional non-mathematical models. In addition, they are
clearly concerned with (4) the concrete compositional structure, process, and
function of the integrated and hierarchical systems that they study. Thus, my
framework distinguishing formal from compositional biology using four
distinctions, is confirmed by, and helps us understand, the theoretical and
empirical structure of biological science.
Furthermore, I have developed the notion of a "theoretical perspective" in
order to provide a conceptual unit that allows us to individuate the practices
(including theoretical practices) of particular communities of scientists concerned
with specific types of methods and goals. A theoretical perspective is a set of
guiding biases and assumptions that coordinates and leads scientific activity,
particularly the activity of a given discipline.
I have provided an "empirical" analysis of six disciplines of compositional
biology using textbooks endemic to each as the source of data for their
commitments to guiding biases and assumptions concerning particularly
partitioning. I have sought to describe the "partitioning frame" peculiar to each
theoretical perspective/discipline. I believe, and hope to have shown, that the
partitioning frame of each discipline I have investigated is presented in its
textbooks – as long as we look carefully enough and focus on, for example, the

Chapter 2
An Empirical Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives
125
structure of the textbooks. I have summarized the guiding biases and
assumptions of each perspective in a table at the end of the chapter.
Let me end here on a tentative note. Focusing on the complexity and
variety of compositional biology, particularly organismal biology, points to an
interesting set of issues – relativism and the disunity of science. What do we
make of the phenomenon, which I hope to have shown here, that completely
different theoretical structures can analyze the same entity—the organism—so
differently, without being in conflict and providing competing hypotheses for the
structures, processes, and functions of that entity? Usually we have an image of
different scientific theories concerning the same structure as being in conflict,
with the difference between them being resolvable by experiments or even "non-
rational" criteria (e.g., the Ptolemaic and Copernican interpretation of the
universe). Perhaps this is the case in much of physics and even formal biology,
where objects are simple and well-defined (recall Appendix Figure 2.1).
Furthermore, in those cases, objects often fall under the purview of one
perspective or another. In compositional biology, genuinely different and
incommensurate perspectives exist blithely side-by-side. In fact, this is a strength
for a robust analysis of systems from the point of view of compositional biology.
Relativism implies robustness here. Disunity leads to strength.

Chapter 3: On the Prospects of Synthesis Between Levels of Selection Theory
and Evolutionary Developmental Biology
3.1 Framing and Goals
In Chapter 1, I differentiated abstractly between two kinds of biology,
formal and compositional. Using textbooks as data, I elaborated on
compositional biology and its diverse theoretical perspectives, or disciplines, in
Chapter 2. In this chapter, I will compare the two kinds of biology using both
levels of selection theory as representative of formal biology, and evolutionary
developmental biology as an instance of compositional biology. As case studies
in this contrast, I will explore how each kind of biological science investigates,
partitions, and interprets two biological levels: organisms and social insect
colonies.
I develop the two respective hierarchies of theoretical perspectives, as
presented in Figure 1. (3.1), to show how formal and compositional biology are
instantiated at different levels of specificity of guiding assumptions and biases192.
This contrast emphasizes that although levels of selection theory and
evolutionary developmental biology study similar units (e.g., multicellular
organisms), they address them differently. For example, as I will show, they
employ different forms of abstraction, use different model-types, differ in their
                                                  
192 As explained in Chapter 2, I do not intend to imply that the assumption is
devious or reprehensible, as vernacular usage suggests. I use "bias" to describe a
"commitment" guiding empirical and theoretical investigation.

Chapter 3

127
views of the relevance of compositional organization, and employ different
explanatory resources. Any attempt at synthesizing the more general theoretical
perspectives that they represent, which is the aim of current attempts at
providing a unified account of evolution, development, and genetics, will be
extremely arduous.193 It is even unclear what such a synthesis would mean. Thus,
we should not glibly proclaim that a synthesis between evolution (sensu levels of
selection theory) and development (sensu evolutionary developmental biology) is
forthcoming. The wide chasm between formal biology and compositional
biology has yet to be bridged and few researchers in either field can articulate
what essential or useful concepts might lie across such a bridge. This makes it
unclear what the nature of such a synthesis will look like, a question to which I
shall turn toward the end of this chapter when I discuss four distinct
interpretations of the relationship between the two hierarchies of theoretical
perspectives.
Let me briefly summarize the organization of the chapter. In section (2), I
provide some general considerations of the two "super"-theoretical perspectives
that levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology fall
under, the competition and the integration theoretical perspectives, respectively. In
section (3), I show in great detail how these two instantiations of the super-
theoretical perspectives investigate both multicellular organisms and social
insect colonies. In section (4), I discuss different possible interpretations of
(failures of) synthesis. In section (5), I conclude with a literary analogy.
                                                  
193 An early attempt at doing this can be found in the collaboration between
Sewall Wright and Theodosius Dobzhansky (Frederick Churchill and Michael
Wade, pers. comm.'s).

3.2 Two Super-Perspectives: General Considerations
In this section, I want to distinguish between two perspectives that
coordinate work in each of the two kinds of biology. I will explore various kinds
of differences between these two "super-perspectives," including their
employment of similar words to mean very different kinds of things. I also
present their differences in a hierarchical diagram.
3.2.1 The Basic Distinction
In previous work, I have distinguished between the Competition Perspective
and the Integration Perspective as two theoretical perspectives guiding work in a
variety of disciplines.194 Here I want to (1) discuss the characteristics of these
"super-perspectives" and (2) relate these, through the use of a diagram, to the
two kinds of science and the two particular cases that I will investigate, levels of
selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology.
First, let me provide a description of each of these two super-perspectives.
Research under the competition perspective explores the selective processes acting
among units at different levels of the genealogical hierarchy (e.g., gene,
organelle, cell, organism, superorganism, species, and clade). It employs the
replicator/interactor distinction. Replicators cause, or are statistically correlated
with, interactors and copies are made of them. Interactors interact as a whole
with their environment and cause the differential reproductive success of

replicators.195 The competition perspective is fundamentally interested in the
patterns and processes of changes in replicator (e.g. gene) frequencies, across
generations, in populations of a mathematically idealized hierarchy of
interactors. For example, in social insect colonies, selection occurs at both the
level of the social insect organism and the social insect colony. However, some
instances of the competition perspective, such as gene selectionism, are not
particularly interested in the hierarchical structure of the interactors – they focus
on the competitive dynamics between the replicators. In general, the competition
perspective explores, for example, the conditions necessary for the fixation of
genes for cooperation at the expense of genes for defection, rather than focusing
on the integrative mechanisms, such as the physiological and behavioral
relations that are involved in organizing the colony.
Investigations in the integration perspective are concerned with the
interactive mechanisms among parts and with the patterns of evolutionary
change of processual and structural parts. Mechanisms of interest to this
perspective can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) developmental, i.e.,
those processes involved in causing the dynamical path taken during the
production of an individual (diachronic), and (2) physiological, that is, those
processes occurring at each step of this path (synchronic). For example, in
multicellular organisms, this perspective investigates both the different
embryonic regions interacting during development and the specialized
physiological processes that ensure organismal cohesiveness and functionality.

3.2.2 When Similar Words Mean Very Different Things
Words like "competition," "defection," "selfishness," "manipulation," and
"independence" are often contrasted with words like "cooperation,"
"integration," "altruism," and "sociality." Although the words do not clearly fall
into neat categories, and although the relations between the terms are many,
there is a contrast between "inward-independence" and "outward-interaction." I
realize that this is very general and vague, but I do think that these two extremes
can be found, in very different ways, in each of the two perspectives –
particularly with respect to how parts (mathematically idealized parts in the case of
the competition perspective196) behave. I will now present how the contrast plays
out in each perspective.
For the competition perspective:
Modular (part) cooperation ["outward-interaction" sensu competition
perspective] is explained as a strategy, on the part of a mathematically
idealized interactor module, to maximize its inclusive fitness or its
reciprocal fitness benefits197, or both, in a group context. Alternatively,
modular cooperation can be enforced by various higher-level control
methods subject to higher-level selection.
Modular (part) defection ["inward-independence" sensu competition
perspective] is accepted. It happens when a mathematically idealized
interactor module gains short-term fitness benefits at the expense of
                                                  
196 Recall the discussion in Chapter 1. The idealized parts (e.g., mathematically
defined loci) are equivalent in kind and are structurally, processually, and
functionally depaupered. They lack the concrete richness of the parts
investigated by the integration perspective.
197 Due to space constraints I do not, in this chapter, specifically discuss this type
of fitness structure, common to game theoretic models. But see Winther 2003 in
press.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
131
another module or the whole collection of modules, that is, at a cost to
other modules or to the whole individual consisting of modules. It is
believed that modular defection occurs in situations inimical to
cooperation, i.e., when genetic relatedness among modules is "too low,"
when reciprocal fitness benefits in mutualistic relationships are "too low,"
or when the higher-level controls on lower-level defector variant modules
fail, or a combination of all three.
For the integration perspective:
Modular (part) integration ["outward-interaction" sensu integration
perspective] is interpreted as diverse kinds of developmental and
physiological processes that establish functional integration of the whole.
The parts engaged in the processes ("agent parts," as explained in Chapter
2) have capacities that explain their integrative behavior198. These
capacities interact to cause higher-level system behavior. Furthermore, the
processes are divided into phases, which I called "activity parts" in
Chapter 2. Integration is the typical result of development. Note that
interaction in this perspective is understood not as a cooperative act, on
the part of strategizing modules bent on increasing their fitness.
Modular (part) independence ["inward-independence" sensu integration
perspective] is interpreted as mechanistic dysfunction. This occurs when
the module does not engage in its appropriate capacity. This is not
                                                  
198 Which I will explore in detail in Chapter 5 in discussing Cummins' views, and
comparing them to Kauffman's and Wimsatt's views on part decompositions and
mechanism ascriptions to provide what Kauffman calls an "articulation of parts"
explanation.

interpreted as being of any advantage, selective or otherwise, for the
module.
 3.2.3 A Diagram: Two Hierarchies of Theoretical Perspectives
As described in Chapter 2, a theoretical perspective is a set of guiding
biases and assumptions pertinent to scientific activity. I mentioned how
theoretical perspectives can exist at multiple levels in an abstraction hierarchy.
My goal is to develop a full hierarchy of theoretical perspectives, with
increasingly fewer guiding biases and assumptions as we move up the hierarchy.
However, the fact that there are fewer biases does not imply that the high-level
biases are narrow or uncreative.199 I depict this hierarchical organization in
Figure 1. (3.1) on the next page.
                                                  
199 In Chapter 5 I will distinguish between two alternative dimensions regarding
abstraction: removal-incremental and creative-mundane. My endorsement of
Cartwright's removal view of abstraction, does not imply that I adopt the view
that more abstract statements, models, or (sets of) biases tie fewer things together
or are less powerful. In fact, biases common to very abstract theoretical
perspectives should be interpreted as extremely powerful. They creatively guide
much work. In this sense, only counting number of biases to evaluate level of
abstraction, while necessary, is not going to fully capture the qualitative aspect of
the biases.

3.2.3.1 General Structure of Diagram
The hierarchy of theoretical perspectives can be imagined to go all the
way up to the two kinds of biology. That is, the five distinctions200 explicated in
Chapters 1 and 5 can be thought of as guiding biases and assumptions (e.g., for
formal biology assume and investigate simple objects). Further specification of
the theoretical perspectives occurs through the addition of (more concrete)
biases. The first level of specification is to implement the central biases pertinent
to the two theoretical perspectives here considered, competition and integration
(called the level of super-perspectives in the diagram). These biases are,
respectively, the replicator/interactor distinction (mirrored, particularly, in
abstract mathematical models), and the view of a complex hierarchical
organization of material structure and process-function parts (represented
especially in representational non-mathematical and material models). There
may be other biases that further specify super-perspectives out of the kinds of
biology – these would then produce a different set of super-perspectives
suggested by the dashed boxes and arrows. I will leave these additional guiding
biases unspecified at this point.
These super-perspectives are then further concretized to form disciplinary
clusters. Mathematical evolutionary genetics has a particular commitment to the
replicator unit – genes (or groups of genes, if they are in linkage disequilibrium)
are replicators. Other disciplinary clusters, such as theoretical mathematical
                                                  
200 I.e., (1) attention to simple versus complex objects, (2) employment of simple
versus complex abstraction, (3) use of mathematical versus propositional non-
mathematical or material models, (4) irrelevance or idealized vs. relevance of
part-whole organization, and (5) causal and theoretical explanation in formal and
compositional contexts (the distinction will be explained in Chapter 5).

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
135
ecology might have different commitments to the replicator unit – such units
could be groups, avatars or species201 or they might have altogether different
sorts of commitments (guiding biases). Describing which super-perspective
motivates the disciplinary cluster of theoretical mathematical ecology, as
indicated by the dashed boxes and arrows, is beyond the scope of this
dissertation.
In the compositional biology hierarchy, the disciplinary cluster
"organismal biology" singles out the organism as the central unit in the
hierarchies of structure and process-function (see Chapter 4). The organism can
be further partitioned202 into various levels, and kinds, of parts. These different
decompositions are done by the various disciplines within organismal biology
(e.g., functional morphology and developmental biology) as represented in the
diagram and as explained in Chapter 2. In this way organismal biology differs
from molecular biology both in focusing on a different level and, more
importantly, in being intrinsically hierarchical. Molecular biology (e.g.,
biochemistry, cellular biology, and molecular genetics) seems to be a level of the
hierarchy within organismal biology, and is therefore most likely "foundational"
("mono-hierarchical") in the sense developed, tentatively, in Chapter 2. Thus, as
portrayed by the dashed boxes and arrows, it is unclear which super-perspective
coordinates work in molecular biology, but this too lies outside of the scope of
this dissertation.

202 Or aggregated. But aggregation of organisms does not usually take place in
the work of organismal biology; this scientific activity is left to, for example, the
ecologists (into populations and communities) and systematists (into genealogies
and clades).

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
136
The last and most concrete level in the hierarchy of theoretical
perspectives here considered is that of disciplines and schools of thought.
Conceptually, both have many detailed guiding biases coordinating their work.
In mathematical evolutionary genetics, differences in such biases between gene
selectionists and levels of selection theorists sometimes lead to acrimonious
debate.203 I use the descriptors "Fisherian genetics" and "Wrightian genetics" as
short-hand summary indices for the distinct assumptions regarding population
size, population structure, genetic architecture, relevance of development, etc.
pertinent to each of these two schools of thought. Basically, Fisherian genetics is
committed to large population sizes with little structure, genes are assumed to
act additively, and the map between genotype and phenotype is assumed to be
fairly simple and not, per se, worth exploring in so far as evolutionary questions
are concerned. In contrast, Wrightian genetics believes in the existence of small
structured populations in which interactions among different sets of genes
existing in each group are crucial; development is considered important too in
that developmental processes, mediated by different genes in different groups,
can express the same gene differently.
In organismal biology, differences in guiding biases (e.g., biases regarding
partitioning) are more fundamental but tend not to lead to debate, but rather to
peaceful co-existence or even blissful mutual ignoring. Perhaps this is because
theoretically-motivated disputes are not as clearly framed and motivated in
compositional biology as they are in formal biology, where a clear mathematical
theoretical structure exists that provides grounds for disagreement.
Sociologically, some universities have different departments of the organismal
                                                  
203 E.g., Lloyd 2000a, 2000b.

Chapter 3

137
biological sciences, such as Pharmacology and Physiology vis-à-vis Organismal
Biology and Diversity at the University of Chicago204 but none have different
departments of evolutionary genetical schools of thought (e.g., "Fisherian
genetics" or "Wrightian genetics") even if a number of researchers in a
department may embrace one of the schools (e.g., at Indiana University,
consistently ranked very highly in evolutionary biology, much research occurs in
the Wright tradition – consider the work of Edmund Brodie, Curtis Lively, and
Michael Wade). The differences at this lowest level of theoretical perspective are
of different magnitudes in the two trees of theoretical perspectives here depicted
– they are greater for the disciplines of compositional biology.
3.2.3.2 The Concept Collider: Evolutionary Developmental Biology
The various disciplines of organismal biology, together with the concepts
and protocols of molecular biology, as well as assumptions and tools from
systematics regarding genealogy205, have been subject to a process of synthesis
over the last 20 years. This synthesis is called evolutionary developmental
biology, or "evo-devo."206 Because it is a "hybrid zone" of research, evolutionary
developmental biology does not include all the conceptual and methodological
biases of its various "constituent" disciplines. Furthermore, it has its own guiding
biases. It has its own problem structure and employs a variety of disparate
methods, acquired from the parent disciplines contained within the double-lined
box of Figure 1. (3.1), to address those problems. In particular, it is concerned

with the roles of genes and higher-level (organismal) modules, or parts207, as both
constraints and causes, in the evolutionary process.  Among other specific issues,
it is concerned with homology assessment, the constraining and causative
influence of genetic architecture208 and developmental patterns in evolution,
evolutionary "somatic" innovations (e.g., fins, jaws, and wings), and the
relationship between micro and macroevolution.209 Note that these are concerns
involving the structural, processual, and functional integration of parts on both
developmental and evolutionary time scales. The focus tends to be on the
relationships among the phenomena of genetics, development, anatomy, and
phylogeny.
As can be seen from a variety of sources, such as Brian Hall's evo-devo
"textbook" and various programmatic articles by Raff, Wagner and co-workers,
Kirschner and Gerhart, and Robert and co-workers, the processually and
functionally oriented disciplines of functional morphology and physiology are
underplayed in evolutionary developmental biology.210 This lacuna is not
absolute, Kirschner and Gerhart do discuss physiology in their article and book,
and Wagner does, implicitly at least, allude to functional morphology in his
work on homology, to be discussed below. Evolutionary developmental biology,
even though it is a hybrid field with many interests, still has relatively little
research on fitness and evolutionary function. In part this is because concerns
                                                  
207 As discussed in Chapter 2.
208 By "genetic architecture" I mean mechanistic interaction among genes. For a
description of such interaction see Davidson 2001.

with natural selection are distinct, even anathema, to a number of the parent
disciplines of evolutionary developmental biology.
3.2.3.3 Four Distinctions, Some Limitations, and the Goal
The diagram of hierarchical theoretical perspectives, albeit incomplete,
helps to fix thoughts on the hierarchical organization of the guiding biases and
assumptions of scientific work in a (large) subset of the biological sciences. This
hierarchical structure adheres formally to the general account of abstraction that
I articulated in Chapter 1 where I took abstraction, of scientific kinds of objects, to
be the removal of properties (of various kinds) from intensional sets referring to
objects. We can think of theoretical perspectives as hierarchical kinds, or at least
being describable in this way. Here the "objects" are the sum total of scientific
activity abstracted (for purposes of definition) into key guiding biases and
assumptions, as discussed in Chapter 2. Now, by removing single biases211 at
each subsequent generalized level, it seems that I am advocating simple
abstraction as the way that theoretical perspectives themselves can be abstracted
from a philosophy of science vantage point. I want, however, to remain agnostic
about this. While addition of single central biases is, perhaps, necessary to
theoretical perspective specification, it is not sufficient. A number of other biases,
particularly regarding laboratory and field practice, are correlated, and are
specified concomitantly, with these biases. Furthermore, the qualitative nature of
the biases added may be different for lower-level biases. Due to constraints on
                                                  
211 Or, going in the concretizing direction indicated in the diagram, by adding
single biases.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
140
conceptual tractability of my analysis, I do not address these issues, although in
Table 3. (2.1), I included some of the laboratory and field practice biases in the
row entitled "General List of Guiding Biases."212
I want to mention two caveats regarding the diagram. First, the diagram
does not represent, or even purport to represent, all biological activity. For
example, there is a significant amount of work in empirical ecology and even
systematics that cannot obviously be subsumed under the two kinds of biology I
have here developed, although perhaps they could be. Although empirical
ecology is certainly not formal, it is also not necessarily compositional in that it
does not necessarily nor explicitly address species or populations as parts of an
integrated system. Further work is required to explore which kinds of biology
(possibly formal or compositional) this and other disciplines of biology would
instantiate.
Second, the diagram is idealized and does not represent the intra-
perspective variation and inter-perspective similarity in actual cases that exists in
the two distinct hierarchies. For example, an actual investigation may employ
guiding biases from developmental biology and comparative anatomy, or, more
pertinently to my analysis, another project may employ the very distinct biases
from both levels of selection theory and developmental biology.213 This is a
problem that I addressed in Chapter 2, where I considered variation within
compositional biology vis-à-vis the four distinctions. My position is that the lines
                                                  
212 For analysis of such biases in laboratory practice, see, for example Gerson
1983; Latour and Woolgar 1986; Latour 1987; Griesemer and Wade 1988. A self-
reflexive piece on such matters by a group of scientists and statisticians is
Neyman, Park, and Scott 1956.
213Although below I classify Buss' seminal 1987 book as a work within the levels
of selection theory perspective, it does use biases belonging to developmental
biology.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
141
of work coordinated by the two kinds of hierarchy of theoretical perspectives
here analyzed are obviously distinct in kind even if, on rare occasions, (putative)
synthetic work appears. It is to such work that we must turn our attention if we
are, as I am, motivated to find synthesis between theoretical perspectives in
distinct kinds of biology (represented by the large question mark).
Let me now turn to the larger goals of this chapter. What is the
relationship between formal biology and compositional biology? Is it one of
different empirical domains (i.e., they study different objects and processes)? Is it
one of different methodological resources and epistemological biases applied to
similar or different domains? Is it both? To ask a different set of questions, are
they incompatible and in tension, do they ignore each other, or can they
strengthen each other through some sort of synthesis and unification? Clearly
these are not easy questions, but in this chapter I will provide a preliminary
analysis of the questions through the particular case studies of levels of selection
theory and evolutionary developmental biology, as instances, respectively, of
formal and compositional biology.214 I will show how the two disciplines, and,
therefore, the two kinds of biology, overlap partly in domain of study, but
because of their very different methodological and epistemological stances,
synthesis between them is difficult and even unclear in principle. I present four
interpretations regarding the relationships between the two disciplines, only one
being a "synthesis." I will not attempt an actual synthesis, which would amount
                                                  
214 Levels of selection theory employs mathematical models and idealizations in
describing the simple objects under its investigative purview. Evolutionary
developmental biology explores various facets of organismal biology, with its
concrete hierarchical part structure and function.

Chapter 3

142
to an answer to the large question mark at the bottom of the diagram – such a
synthesis would require the work of many biologists and philosophers.
I will now turn to a detailed exposition of the two disciplines.
3.3 Two Super-Theoretical Perspectives: Case Studies
I will here explore how the respective instances of the two super-
theoretical perspectives, levels of selection theory and evolutionary
developmental biology, both investigate multicellular organisms and social
insect colonies. Doing this in detail will show how each discipline/school of
thought is distinct in terms of the (epistemic and methodological) guiding biases
and assumptions it employs.
3.3.1 Levels of Selection Theory on Social Insect Colonies
In discussing levels of selection theory, I will start with the social insect
colonies because it is with these systems that levels of selection theory in the
competition perspective originated. Historically, this started with Darwin's
worries about the evolution of sterility in hymenoptera, where the drastic
reduction of immediate organism (or gene) fitness (i.e., sterility) in favor of a
higher-level group of related organisms is most apparent. Only in the last two
decades has a levels of selection research program been applied to multicellular
organisms, starting with Buss' 1987 book. As discussed in Chapter 1, a
commitment to different levels in nature, and selection among units at those
different levels, does not imply a commitment to the relevance of concrete

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
143
compositionality. In fact, parts are highly mathematically idealized in levels of
selection theory. In my analysis to follow I sometimes contrast the ontological
and modeling (epistemic) commitments of investigators following levels of
selection theory with those of researchers in the gene selectionist tradition. I do
this in order to clarify and emphasize the guiding biases of levels of selection
theory and to show diversity of biases within the competition perspective.
3.3.1.1 The Origins of Levels of Selection Theory, 1964-1975: The
work of W. D. Hamilton and G. R. Price
Why are some organisms, such as hymenopteran workers, sterile? This
seems to amount to having a fitness of zero. The origin and maintenance of
cooperation, which is often called altruism, was a problem that Darwin wrestled
with in his famous book.215 His prescient answer appealed to family-level
selection of "fertile parents which produced most neuters with… profitable
modification[s]."216 Both Sewall Wright  and G. C. Williams started to extend
Darwin's logic, but the first full mathematical exposition of this group selection
argument was developed by Hamilton more than 100 years after Darwin's
comment.217 Initially, however, Hamilton argued against group selection and felt
that inclusive fitness made kin selection an extension of individual selection.218
Hamilton was interested in why organisms would reduce their fitness, for the
benefit of other organisms, through behaviors such as defending the other

organism or helping it to reproduce. Qualitatively, he argued that an allele that
caused a behavior detrimental to a particular individual would increase in
frequency when the recipients of the behavior were close kin who, with a high
probability, carried the same allele. Quantitatively, he noted the conditions under
which alleles for cooperation could increase in frequency: rB – C > 0, or   r >
(C/B). In this equation, r is the coefficient of relatedness (e.g. in diplo-diploids
(e.g. mammals) organism-to-sibling r = .5; organism-to-first cousin r = .125), B is
the fitness benefit the given behavior provides to the recipient, and C is the
fitness cost, to the benefactor (focal individual), of performing the behavior. This
equation is known as "Hamilton's rule" and it represents the conditions under
which  kin selection occurs.
What Hamilton noted was that in hymenoptera, females are more closely
related to their sisters (r = .75) than to their offspring of either sex (r = .5),
provided that the females have the same father.219 This high relatedness220 occurs
because hymenoptera are haplo-diploid: males have only one chromosome of
each pair of chromosomes, females have both chromosomes of each pair of
chromosomes. Thus, on relatedness grounds alone, a female should choose to
help her mother rear offspring, which are her sisters: "Our principle tells us that
even if this new adult had a nest ready constructed and vacant for her use she
would prefer, other things being equal, returning to her mother's and
                                                  
219 Michael Wade noted that "many 'modern behaviorists' are less enamored with
the Haplo-Diploids than with the within-colony conflict between queen and
worker over the sex ratio as the best supporting evidence for Hamilton's theory."
(Michael Wade, pers. comm., July 3, 2003)
220 Historically, this became generalized later to high gene identity. I thank
Elisabeth Lloyd for reminding me of this historical shift.

provisioning a cell for the rearing of an extra sister to provisioning a cell for a
daughter of her own."221
There are complications to this simple theory, however. Hamilton noted,
as others subsequently have, that multiply-mated queens produce female
offspring with a relatedness coefficient smaller than .75. If the queen has mated
with two males, and assuming equal contribution from the two males and no
sperm competition, among-sibling relatedness is .5. If the queen has mated with
more than two males, the relatedness coefficient is smaller than .5 and converges
to .25 as the number of males gets very large, given the assumptions stated
above.222 (In honey bees, a queen will typically mate with more than 20 males!223)
Hamilton noted that, despite this, cooperation would still be favored given
appropriate B and C parameters. Furthermore, in some genera, for example,
worker fire ants of the genus Solenopsis, which lack ovaries, reproduction is not
even a possibility. Thus, other parameters and conditions besides r, B, and C
need to be considered. Another complication that Hamilton discussed, but did
not suggest an explanation for in his early articles, is that a worker is only related
by .25 to her brothers, whereas she would be related by .5 to a son. Trivers and
Hare subsequently suggested that workers would still prefer to raise sisters
rather than offspring if they could skew the sex ratio of sibling reproductives
toward a 3:1 gyne224:male ratio.225 Complications such as these have convinced

investigators that Hamilton's rule is shorthand for more elaborate quantitative
and population genetic models.
Investigators in the competition perspective employ Hamilton's rule.
Their focus is on the reproductive dynamics of social insect colonies leading to
gene frequency change. They have furthermore tended to only estimate r.226 This
is in part because it remains conceptually unclear how to estimate B and C,
which both depend on ecological conditions. For example, which metric could
we use to compare alternative worker strategies of egg-laying and foraging in
estimating B and C?227
Despite complications regarding Hamilton's rule, it has turned out to be
powerful, given assumptions of genetic variance additivity. A number of
population geneticists were skeptical of Hamilton's rule until it could be shown
in the 1980s by Feldman, Uyenoyama, Wade, and others that it describes, under
additivity assumptions, changes in gene frequency and not just an inevitable
fitness maximization. The rule and mathematical models developed from it are a
good example of formal biology as can be seen with how the four differentiae are
met in this case. (1) The rule applies to any (additively acting) gene that somehow
increases altruism – the rule and models pertinent to it represent genes as
idealized simple objects (that are equivalent vis-à-vis one another and can
therefore be represented with the same formula). Furthermore, details of the
behaving individuals who constitute the social group are ignored. (2) It involves
simple abstraction in that a broad variety of different genes, behavioral
mechanisms (including those involved in both defense and reproduction!), and

ecological contexts are ignored, or at least averaged out, and the same few
necessary and sufficient properties determine each of the mathematical kinds of
the rule (r228, B, and C).  Note that r is a property of the replicator, whereas B and
C are properties of the interactors (and interactor-environment averaged
context). Furthermore, elaborations of Hamilton's rule in more concrete models
follow precise additions of variable types with necessary and sufficient
definitional properties. (3) Hamilton's rule and the models developed from it are
formalized mathematical models. They are based on principled assumptions
regarding genetic relatedness and cost-benefit relations among simple objects
with precise mathematically-defined behaviors. Furthermore Hamilton's rule is
law-like. (4) Compositional organization is not considered relevant and is
idealized by abstraction. The few precise salient properties of the idealized
units/agents of the social system are captured in the different mathematical
kinds, for purposes of the principled mathematical model.
Hamilton initially emphasized that kin selection was an extension of
individual selection; he used the term "inclusive fitness."229 Price's covariance
approach to selection radically changed Hamilton's view on kin selection.230
                                                  
228 Even in recent derivations of the rule, employing different definitions of
relatedness, for example, there are still precise definitions about how to abstract
these different variables (i.e., there are clear necessary and sufficient properties
accruing to each variable type); see Frank 1997 who distinguishes two types of
similarity correlations ("r") that serve different purposes (intra-generational vs.
inter-generational  dynamics).
229 E.g. Hamilton 1964a.
230 In his autobiographical introductory sketch to the reprint of the article,
Hamilton writes: "…I am proud to have included the first presentation of Price's
natural selection formalism as applied to group-level processes. I wish George
Price had been alive to see it published." (Hamilton 1996, p. 318) In the actual
article, Hamilton writes: "A recent reformulation of natural selection can be
adapted to show how two successive levels of the subdivision of a population
contribute separately to the overall natural selection. The approach is not limited

(Covariance is a probabilistic and statistical measure of the correlation between
two variables.) Price sought to develop a "general selection theory."231 He realized
that selection could be thought of as a covariance between the fitness of the
hierarchical units under study and their properties. These properties could be
genotypic or phenotypic. Price, and others, have shown mathematically that this
covariance can be decomposed into two components, each of which describes
selection at one of two levels – (1) within the interactor unit (that is, among lower-
level interactor units) and (2) among interactor units.232
A hierarchical selection process thus causes gene (replicator) frequency
change. In social insects, a non-zero first component representing within-colony
selection could be caused by workers altering the colony sex-ratio and thereby
altering the normal Mendelian ratios (i.e. under-representing maternal genes by
destroying males, over-representing paternal genes by not destroying gynes).
This is analogous to meiotic drive in organisms.233 In social insects, a non-zero
second component indicating among-colony selection would occur whenever
some colonies left more offspring colonies than other colonies. Such selection is
also part of some sex-ratio evolution models.234 Among-colony selection is
analogous to organismal selection in organisms. Price's multi-level selection
equation, which decomposes the causes of gene frequency change, can be further
expanded to any number of levels so that we can have, for example, among-
                                                                                                                                                      
to Mendelian inheritance but its usefulness in other directions (e.g., cultural
evolution) has not yet been explored." (Hamilton 1996, p. 332)

colony, among-ant (e.g., sex ratio conflict within colonies), and within-ant (e.g.,
meiotic drive in queen ants) selection in social insects. The Price Equation is one
of the central, as well as theoretically unifying, mathematical models of levels of
selection theory.235
Hamilton employed Price's equation in an article in which he argued that
kin selection was, indeed, a multi-level selection process.236 Cooperation could
evolve (i.e. alleles for cooperation increase in frequency) if among-colony
selection for such alleles was stronger than within-colony selection against such
alleles. One way to increase among-colony additive genetic fitness variance was
precisely to have colonies with only one or a few queens mated with only one or
a few males. This is analogous to unicellular bottleneck reproduction of sexual
organisms.237 In these cases most additive genetic fitness variance would be
among colonies, rather then within them.
Kin selection, whether conceptualized as a single-level or multi-level
process, describes the selective dynamics among interactors at multiple levels of
selection, such as ant-organisms and social insect colonies. Replicators, such as
alleles for cooperative behavior, can increase in frequency as a consequence of
these dynamics.

3.3.1.2 The Expansion of Levels of Selection Theory, 1976-2003
Subsequent to the development of Price's equation, levels of selection
theory was expanded by a number of investigators.238 Broadly stated, these
investigators found that most cases of selection can be understood as hierarchical
selection processes with hierarchical selective components. All cases of selection
in populations with social interactions can be decomposed into at least two
components: selection among groups and selection among individuals.
Importantly, all cases of kin selection are hierarchical and Hamilton's rule can be
shown to be a necessary condition for selection among groups to override
opposing selection among individuals.239 Not all cases of hierarchical selection
need involve kin, however: consider selection on symbiotic relations such as
lichens. Here, selection of the two-species group caused the symbiotic relation to
evolve.
There are indeed few cases in nature to which a hierarchical approach
could not be applied. Those cases that approach the Fisherian idealization of
extremely large, randomly-mating, unstructured populations are candidates. The
empirical adequacy of the Fisherian idealization is an ongoing topic of debate.
Even if the idealization is false, however, its utility in making mathematical
models simple and tractable still remains a powerful argument, in its favor, for
gene selectionists.240 The levels of selection approach has been further applied

with great fervor to social insects in recent years.241 It can be used to understand
the selective dynamics occurring among and within social insect colonies,
considered as abstract units.
But the hierarchical approach has met resistance from investigators
adopting a gene selectionist viewpoint regarding kin selection. A number of
behavioral ecologists still interpret inclusive fitness and kin selection as an
organismal or genic level process or property, as Hamilton originally did in his
articles from the 1960s.242 According to these investigators, complete models can
be built using inclusive fitness defined only at the single level of the organism or
gene.
But perhaps the difference between gene selectionists and levels of
selection theorists is not significant. A number of investigators have cogently
shown that single-level inclusive fitness is mathematically equivalent to hierarchical
selection if the former is defined, modeled, and estimated correctly.243 Two of
these researchers argue that:
a good understanding of altruism, and the evolution of higher
levels of organization in nature, is fostered by the ability to make
repeated 'gestalt-switches' between the different perspectives. That
is, we should cultivate the ability to switch between seeing groups
as fitness-bearing in their own right [levels of selection theory] and
seeing groups as part of the milieu that determines the fitnesses of
individuals [gene selectionism]. Each perspective makes some facts
vivid and obscures others.244
Kerr and Godfrey-Smith's pluralism includes an argument against Sober and
Wilson's critique of averaging. In their book, Sober and Wilson had claimed that

a fundamental mistake in gene selectionist models is that such models define any
allele-type that increases in frequency in the population at large as selfish, even
for "altruistic" allele-types that are only increasing in frequency because of the
existence of population structure (i.e., they would actually decrease in frequency
in a panmictic group, and do so within groups anyway). Sober and Wilson
argued that we must avoid this "averaging fallacy" of only looking at average
population-at-large effects because it obscures the causal structure245 of natural
selection. Furthermore, gene selectionists "help themselves," to use a term I got
from Lloyd in conversation, to the hierarchical fitness structures of the models.
That is, they derive the single-level fitness parameters from previous hierarchical
fitness structures. Kerr and Godfrey-Smith, however, argue that averaging
occurs in all models, albeit in different ways – for example in the Price equation, the
covariance between relative fitness of individual types and the properties of
individual types is averaged over all groups, giving the expectation term of the
Price equation. In this case, there is an implicit "group" averaging in the
"individual" component of the Price equation.246
Kerr and Godfrey-Smith may be correct in their claims that (1) averaging
occurs in different ways in the two schools of thought, and hence is a sin
common to both, and (2) the models of the two schools of thought can be shown
to be equivalent when parameters are defined carefully (i.e., precise equalities
are articulated) for each school of thought model-type. Like Sober, Wilson, and
Lloyd, however, I believe that causal structure will be obscured in gene
selectionist models and hierarchical fitness parameters are crucial elements for
                                                  
245 And correctly articulating causal structure is a desideratum of theory.

research programs that honestly try to capture the hierarchical selective
dynamics. However, I also believe that this debate will continue and will not be
resolved on rational grounds alone.247
I want to add a psychological and sociological dimension to this debate.
Even if we grant that (1) the mathematics of Kerr and Godfrey-Smith is
completely accurate, (2) the averaging is done by both schools of thought, and (3)
"group" and "individual " level parameters and operations are conflated in the
Price equation and other formulations of group selection, the two schools of
thought and respective model-types are not equivalent – each one carries with it
psychological biases (in the broad sense of Chapter 2) regarding which causal
structures and processes should be looked for, and assumed, in the world. It is
no accident that, sociologically, it is mainly advocates of levels of selection theory
that have been interested in, for example, evolutionary transitions: Leo Buss248,
Steve Frank, William Hamilton, Richard Michod, and Michael Wade. 249 (Of
course, there are exceptions to this correlation, such as Maynard Smith250, but by
and large it holds.) I argue that it is precisely because of their multi-level
mathematical modeling bias that they are interested in multi-level processes in
nature, and vice-versa. If our research program interest is the evolution of
hierarchical organization, then we should employ levels of selection theory, for
pragmatic psychological and sociological reasons. The biases concerning the model

248 In a provocative passage, Buss writes, "Economic and political reality favors
the language of genic selection. In these essays, I have, nonetheless, adopted the
opposite position: that of a hierarchical perspective on the units of selection
problem." Buss 1987, p. 179.

set-up of parameter and variable definitions in order to represent selective and
genetic causal dynamics in levels of selection theory are the right ones to capture
the complexity and hierarchical structure of evolutionary transitions.251 Further
discussion of pragmatic reasons for adopting levels of selection theory should
complement current "theoretical" (sensu mathematical) discussion.252
Furthermore, one set of theoretical divergences and arguments within
mathematical evolutionary genetics has now been clarified.
3.3.2 Levels of Selection Theory on Multicellular Organisms
Now that we have explored levels of selection theory on social insects,
which is where the key mathematical models of kin selection, and multi-level
selection, were developed, let us turn to the organism level which has also
recently received attention as a case of hierarchical selection, both currently and
in its origin.253 The key question for the competition perspective with respect to
the organism is: Why did, and do, cell lineages in organisms cooperate rather
than defect? Defection appears to be favored at the cell level; cell lineages leaving
more cell offspring have a higher fitness, at that level, than those that do not.
                                                  
251 I am not advocating that we restrict the use of levels of selection theory to
evolutionary transitions. It can also be used for more micro-evolutionary
questions, such as in Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory. Furthermore, I
here leave open the question of the use of levels of selection theory by more
compositionally-minded biologists such as S. J. Gould, as represented in Gould
2002 and in Gould and Lloyd 1999. Clearly there are interesting synthetically-
minded biologists (including also primarily "formalists" such as Lewontin and
Wade, and mainly "compositionalists" such as Günter Wagner).
252 See Wimsatt 1984 for an important early attempt at doing this.
253 Hamilton (like Maynard Smith and Szathmáry following him), in contrast,
believed that "the bodies of multicellular organisms" consisted of clones and,
"…our theory predicts for clones a complete absence of any form of competition
which is not to the overall advantage and also the highest degree of mutual
altruism." (Hamilton 1996 (1964b), p. 55)

Cooperation seems to be disadvantageous at that level; somatic specialization
and the attendant curtailed reproduction lowers the immediate fitness of a
particular cell. A number of solutions, particularly kin selection (selection among
organisms as collections of genetically related cell lineages) and organismal
control (policing and punishing of "rogue" cell lineages by the immune or other
systems), have been proposed. I divide my discussion into investigators who
claim that cell-lineage defection is mainly absent in well-integrated organisms
and those who claim that it is prevalent.
3.3.2.1 Cell-Lineage Defectors are Rare in Well-Integrated
Organisms
The locus classicus for discussion of the evolution of multicellularity, which
is an evolutionary transition, is Buss' The Evolution of Individuality.254 He notes
that an organism is actually not a "genetically homogenous unit"255 although it
does consist of "clonal lineages"256. An organism is an environment "populated by
normal and variant cells."257 Cell lineages, which are interactors, compete within
this "somatic ecology"258. Variant, that is, defector, cell lineages divide in an
uncontrolled fashion and contribute little to somatic cell function. They are often
detrimental to the whole organism. There is also strong cell-lineage selection for
variant cell lineages to enter into the areas, or be part of the lineages, that fulfill

the reproductive functions. Defector cell lineages can therefore disrupt both
somatic and reproductive organismal functions, according to Buss.259
Since organismal stability, early in the evolution of multicellularity, was
threatened by defector cell lineages, methods of controlling defection were
strongly favored at the organismal level. For example, (1) the evolution of a
sequestered germ-line eliminated the possibility that a variant cell lineage could
be heritable across organismal generations. Furthermore, since germ cells
undergo significantly fewer cell divisions than somatic cells, there is a smaller
likelihood of mutation occurring in them, given an approximately constant
mutation rate per cell division. Buss also considers (2) maternal control of early
development and (3) inductive interactions as organismal control methods. If
maternally-derived egg cytoplasmic mRNA and proteins determine division
patterns and cell fate, then a cell-lineage variant, with its own genotypic and
phentoypic properties, cannot arise until maternal control stops.260 Similarly,
inductive interactions between cell lineages "restrain[ ] or direct[ ] the activities
of neighboring cells, …[thereby] enhanc[ing] their own replication and the
survivorship of the individual harboring them."261 This last control method is the
only one in which the direction of selection is the same at both the cellular and the
individual levels (i.e., an appropriately inducing cell lineage increases its own, as
                                                  
259 Michael Wade noted to me the interesting reciprocal case: cell lineages
undergo apoptosis, or "suicidal" destruction through the activation of internal
genetic mechanisms. This suicide is also for the good of the organism. Cell
suicide, for example, accounts for normal development of fingers, where the cells
in the "web" between the fingers die. This is an interesting phenomenon
deserving more attention in the competition perspective. Due to its, up to now,
inadequate coverage in the research of the competition perspective, I will not be
further concerned with it.

157
well as the organism's, replication rate). Note that all these methods of control
are considered higher-level adaptations at the organismal level. Note also that
for Buss, the cooperation of cell lineages is the crucial central explanandum.
Sometimes these methods of control fail as when mammalian cancers
occur.262 Less dramatic somatic mutations can also occur. Thus, Buss implies that
defection by somatic cell lineages does occur in well-integrated organisms,
despite numerous control methods. Germ-line mutational variants are, however,
rare since there are "overlapping periods of maternal direction and germ-line
sequestration."263 The generation of germ-line variation is mainly a consequence
of meiosis and recombination.
In his book's last chapter, aptly titled "The Evolution of Hierarchical
Organization," Buss argues that "The history of life is a history of transitions
between different units of selection."264 This is because "any given unit of
selection, once established, can come to follow the same progression of
elaboration of a yet higher organization, followed by stabilization of the novel
organization."265 Thus, stabilization of individuals through control methods
occurs after transitions to that level of individuality. Buss's book is an exploration
of the transition to, and stabilization of, the multicellular level. In his conclusion
he notes that there are many other levels requiring investigation, such as "the
association of individuals into kin groups"266, which is the case in social insects.
Buss work was groundbreaking in that it was the first clear and cohesive
case of the competition theoretical perspective applied to the organism. It is of

interest that most of Buss' models are narrative and diagrammatic, that is,
representational non-mathematical models. His rich conceptual discussion refers
constantly to detailed developmental, molecular, and genetic mechanisms. There
is not a single mathematical biological model in his book. Such representational
strategies tend to be the purview of the integration perspective. So this is a case
where the concepts fit under the competition perspective, but the models and
reference to compositional organization fit under the integration perspective. Today,
judging by who pays attention to the book, Buss' work is seen as a quintessential
example of the competition perspective. Many practitioners of evolutionary
developmental biology, a case of the integration perspective, have since judged
his work mistaken and irrelevant.267 Investigators of levels of selection theory hail
it as a landmark and have ignored the detailed mechanistic arguments and
representational non-mathematical models Buss gave and have, instead,
provided mathematical models congruent with Buss' work.
Buss explored one explanation for the evolution of cellular cooperation:
higher-level control methods. Another crucial explanation investigated
subsequently to Buss is kin selection, which Hamilton first developed in a
mathematically rigorous fashion, as described above. In their book on transitions,
Maynard Smith and Szathmáry argue that control methods are not required for
the stabilization, during evolution, of higher-level organisms.268 Genetic
similarity among cells and cell lineages of an organism is sufficient to arrest any

referred to Buss' research program as a "failed one" in conversation. See Winther
2001a, pp. 125-126. But see Gilbert 1992, who discusses Buss favorably. I will
return to Gilbert's paper at the end of this chapter.

potential conflicts.269 Alleles for cooperation can reach fixation given such high
degrees of relatedness (r ≈ 1) between mathematically idealized parts, that is cell
lineages. With this argument, these authors ignore the potentiality, and reality, of
mutation and they do not consider the full range of selective parameters (e.g.
when defection benefit is high). If mutation occurs, and the selective differential
is sufficiently high, cooperation will not reach fixation despite generally high
relatedness.270
Regarding kin selection, Maynard Smith has argued that it should be
understood as happening at the level of the individual – the organism.271 But
when he and Szathmáry discuss cell (sensu individual) versus organism (sensu
group) selection, it is unclear whether they argue that kin selection has only a
cell-level component or whether it also has an organism-level component (see,
for example, their analogy between the "stochastic corrector model" and kin
selection272). They do, however, state their allegiance to the "gene-centered
approach" of Williams (1966) and Dawkins (1976)273 and they do not cite any of
the literature on multi-level kin selection theory. Both of these actions imply that
Maynard Smith and Szathmáry believe that cellular kin selection occurs only at
the cell-level and are, in effect gene selectionists. Hence Maynard Smith is an
(rare!) example of a gene selectionist interested in evolutionary transitions.

selection, as Lloyd pointed out to me. However, this pales in contrast to his
general advocacy of genic selection.

Michod and co-workers provide detailed mathematical models that
employ both multi-level kin selection and higher-level control methods to
explain the origin and maintenance of multicellularity.274 Consistent with levels
of selection theory, Michod has both cell-level and organism-level fitness
parameters in his models (e.g. replication rate of defector versus cooperator cells;
organism-level fitness as a function of cooperator cell frequency). If higher-level,
that is, organismal, selection is sufficiently strong, alleles for cooperation will
increase in frequency in the population. However, a number of parameters need
to be considered to determine whether cooperation can reach fixation275: total
number of cell divisions in an individual, mutation rate, and relative benefit to a
defector cell (which can be less than one; in this case mutations are deleterious at
both the cell and organism level). In most of the parameter space Michod
explores, alleles for cooperation do not reach fixation even though idealized
interactor cell lineages are related by common descent.276 Kin selection is not
sufficient for the origin of organismal individuality, higher-level organismal
control methods such as germ-line sequestration and defection-policing
mechanisms (e.g. immune systems) are necessary.277 Michod's models are thus a
mathematical articulation of Buss' emphasis on organismal control methods.

275 As any of these three parameters increases, the equilibrium frequency of
cooperation diminishes (Richard Michod, pers. comm.). Note that by "fixation" I
mean an extremely high frequency of alleles for cooperation: recurrent mutation
ensures that no allele is every fixed, strictly speaking.

3.3.2.2 Cell-Lineage Defectors are Common in Well-Integrated
Organisms
A number of authors who endorse the competition perspective claim that
cell-lineage selection occurs with substantial frequency in well-integrated
organisms. Otto and co-workers have investigated germ-line cell-lineage
selection in contemporary organisms.278 They argue that the number of cell-
divisions from zygote to zygote is sufficiently large to consider their mutations
and mutation rate evolutionarily important (e.g. 50 in Maize, 25 for Drosophila, 25
for female mice, and 23 for human females, per generation279). The mathematical
models of Otto and co-workers indicate that depending on the hierarchical (i.e.
cell-level and individual-level) costs and benefits of mutations, intraorganismal
selection can increase or reduce the mutation rate. Furthermore, selection
between germ-line cell lineages can also decrease the mutation load in a
population since deleterious mutations in such lineages will tend to be
eliminated as they compete.
These selective scenarios differ crucially from Buss', Michod's, and
Maynard Smith and Szathmáry's in that selection is interpreted as often acting in
the same direction at both levels. Most loss-of-function mutations deleterious at
the individual level are also deleterious at the cellular level. Furthermore,
"mutations that improve the efficiency of metabolic pathways may often be
beneficial at both levels."280 Insofar as selection operates in the same direction at
both levels, control methods are not necessary. But if a fraction of mutations have

beneficial cell-level effects, but deleterious individual-level effects, control
methods will be necessary. An interesting research project investigating the
relative frequency of this case of opposing directions of selection at the two
levels, and the evolution of control methods as a function of its increased
frequency awaits exploration.281
Nunney also emphasizes the reality of modular competition, in the form
of cancer, in well-integrated organisms.282 Growth-controlling genes that
suppress the defector consequences of mutations in other growth-controlling
genes would be selectively advantageous at the organism level. Despite such
controls, cancers are almost inevitable in idealized modules with high replication
and turnover rates (e.g. epithelial cells in the skin, hemopoietic cells in bone
marrow and lymphatic tissue). Similarly to Michod and Buss, Nunney
emphasizes the case of multi-level selection operating in opposite directions.
However, he differs from them in believing that modular defection is
ubiquitous.283
Levels of selection theory has been applied consistently to both social
insect colonies and multicellular organisms. The existence of hierarchical
competition is clearer in the former than in the latter, yet theory has been applied
successfully to the latter as well. In particular, levels of selection theory has
provided explanations for the origin of germ-line sequestration.
                                                  
281 Sarah Otto, pers. comm.

283 One problem with these views in general is that defection (especially cancer)
often occurs after effective selection among organisms, that is, after organism
reproduction (Michael Wade, pers. comm.). This has, to my knowledge, yet been
clearly addressed in the literature.

3.3.3 Evolutionary Developmental Biology on Multicellular Organisms
In discussing evolutionary developmental biology, I will start by
discussing multi-cellular organisms because these were the units first studied by
this theoretical perspective. In fact, an embryonic version of evo-devo began with
Darwin's, Haeckel's, and Weismann's nineteenth-century syntheses of evolution,
development, and heredity.284 Investigators studying organisms have also
recently explicitly employed the concept of "modularity," that is, parthood. Only
in the last 15 years or so has the possibility of an evolutionary developmental
biology research program of social insect colonies become real. However, as we
shall see, this research program is flourishing.
As a set of examples of evolutionary developmental biology at the
organism level, each employing a different module type, let us explore the work
of four contemporary practitioners in this discipline, Gerhart (biochemist) and
Kirschner (cellular biologist), Raff (developmental biologist), and Wagner
(comparative anatomist, developmental biologist, and population geneticist).
Although their work is interdisciplinary, each investigator (the first two
considered as a pair) tends to focus on one kind of module, as described in Chapter
2, which tend to be correlated with their main discipline of interest. They share
the integration perspective, because the latter two focus on the complex
integration of hierarchical systems at the organismal level and although Gerhart
and Kirschner emphasize molecular biology, they illustrate the complex
integration of systems such as metabolic cycles and gene regulatory networks.

3.3.3.1 Molecular Modules
 In their book, Gerhart and Kirschner explore two important themes: (1)
the conservation of basic molecular modular processes within and across taxa
and (2) the intensity of interaction among molecular modules.285 They explain the
evolutionary conservation of protein function and structure in terms of processes
of connectivity among multiple intra-cellular metabolic and regulatory systems.
This connectivity is "contingent" in that molecular and cellular networks require
multiple inputs for proper functioning. For example, protein kinases, which
change the conformation of other proteins by adding a phosphate group from
ATP to them, quickly activate or inhibit the other proteins.286 This is an example
of contingent connectivity in that catalytic proteins depend on other catalytic
proteins for their state of activation or inhibition. Contingent connectivity also
indicates the importance of complex networks of processes, networks of
molecular modules, in Gerhart and Kirschner's approach. In their approach,
molecular modules are crucial in explaining development and evolution.287
3.3.3.2 Developmental Modules
Raff and Wagner both focus on the organismal level but Raff concentrates
on developmental modules, whereas Wagner emphasizes structural modules. I
shall explore aspects of their respective theoretical and empirical research

programs in some detail since I am concerned with the organismal level in my
account of evolutionary developmental biology.
Raff and co-workers study the genetic and developmental differences
between two sister species of sea urchins, Heliocidaris erythrogramma and H.
tuberculata.288 The former species develops directly from an egg to an adult,
whereas the latter is an indirect developer, that is, it has a pluteus larval stage.289
In the direct developer, in contrast to the indirect developer, all of the early cells
of the morula are the same size, "thus, the unequal cleavages typical of indirect-
developing sea urchins have been eliminated." In direct developers "cell types
homologous [i.e., similar in structure] to those of indirect developers have
different precursors."290 There is thus a mismatch of early developmental
modules even though the adult structural modules are congruent. This case is of
interest because, to rearrange the words of the title of Chapter 7 of Raff's 1996
book, similar animals are built in different ways. What is also remarkable is that
the splitting of these lineages occurred only 4-5 million years ago291, which means
that the evolution of their radical developmental differences occurred quickly.
Raff studies this system because he is interested in a variety of issues
concerning developmental modules, such as: (1) the radical reorganization of
early development in related species (to produce the same adult structure), (2)
assessment of which developmental patterns and processes are evolutionarily
ancestral and which are derived, (3) the co-option of genetic systems for new
processes, such as the reorganized developmental modules. The sea urchin

166
system provides a window into these issues because Raff can study the radical
differences in development between the two sister species through techniques
such as cell fate mapping with dyes, transplantation, egg/sperm hybridization,
in situ hybridization, and gene knockouts.292
A number of questions pertinent to evolutionary developmental biology
can be addressed with this kind of data: (1) is indirect or direct development
ancestral (put differently, is the pattern of evolution recapitulatory (adding on
new terminal stages to development over evolutionary time) or can there be
insertions of new types of stages in earlier parts of development over
evolutionary time?), (2) (related to (1)) what was the Cambrian echinoderm (and
other invertebrate) fauna similar to: modern larval or adult forms?, (3) what is
the architecture of the genetic regulatory systems underlying these changes?293
This research, as well as his theoretical discussion of morphogenetic fields
during mid and late development, and the "hourglass model of development," in
which mid development is highly constrained, whereas early and late
                                                  
292 Raff 1996, Raff and Sly 2000; E. Raff et al. 1999 and Nielsen et al. 2000 both
present recent successes with hybridization experiments.
293 These are unresolved issues. Raff argues that direct development is ancestral
and that, therefore, insertion of new stages is the correct evolutionary pattern
and that the body plan of Cambrian fauna was small modern-adult-like
echinoderms (Raff 1996, 2000). Davidson and co-workers, on the other hand,
argue that indirect development is ancestral and that recapitulation is correct in
this case – the "set-aside cells" in larvae that give rise to the adult structures are
therefore a derived character of an ancestral character, the larva (rather than,
under the Raff hypothesis, a derived character of a derived character). [For a
competition perspective on the evolution of set-aside cells, see Blackstone and
Ellison 2000.] Davidson argues that the Cambrian fauna consisted of small
modern-larva-like echinoderms (Davidson et al. 1995; Peterson et al. 2000). Each
side provides genetic regulatory data supporting their view. Note that while
Raff's sea urchin studies certainly provide data regarding contemporary gene
regulation in two recently branched species, significantly more data, gathered
from a significantly broader taxonomic viewpoint, is necessary to aid in
resolving conundrums regarding genetic and developmental patterns and
processes in the deep phylogenetic past.

167
development shows flexibility (Appendix Figures 3.2 and 3.3), all indicate Raff's
emphasis on developmental modules.294 He is concerned with what causes such
modules, including the genetic regulatory network, and how the modules get
reorganized, and are processual blocks, in the reorganization of body plans,
during evolution.
3.3.3.3 Structural Modules
Wagner studies morphology, developmental biology, systematics, and
population genetics. Wagner takes structural modules (parts) as his central object
of investigation. For him, these are deeply connected to homologues: all modules
of a particular kind are homologues and vice-versa.295 Unlike Raff and many
others, Wagner prefers a structural rather than a phylogenetic definition of
homology,
Structural identity is more fundamental than common descent. In
fact the phylogenetic definition of homology implicitly requires the
notion of structural identity… What is gained by Darwin's concept
[of homology as the derivation of the "same" character/part, in two
descendants, from a common ancestor] is not a deeper insight into
the phenomenon of structural identity, but an explanation why
structurally identical characters are distributed among recent
species in nested sets.296
Thus, Wagner rejects the phylogenetic definition of homology both as a criterion
and as a cause of homology.297 He holds that homologues are the basic structural

297 On this distinction, see Bolker and Raff 1996, particularly Appendix Figure
(Table) 3.4. The debate over the homology concept is extremely complex and it is

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
168
"building blocks" of biological structure298 and must be recognized by criteria that
establish the structural identity of different concrete parts of the same kind. He
appeals to structural and developmental causes of homology stabilization and
constraint during development and evolution.299 Thus, his criteria of homology
identification are structural and the causes are structural and developmental.
Although he has a hierarchical approach to causes of homology maintenance, he
appeals strongly to relatively unique sets of expressed genes as causative
agents.300 For example, for the case of fin development explored immediately
below, he presents an "epigenetic trap model" of growth in which the fin is a
"semiautonomous character complex."301 Structurally defined modules are
conserved across taxa (i.e., are caused) because of developmental constraints
mediated by gene action ("generative" and "morphostatic" constraints).302
In addition to his concerns with structure, Wagner is also clearly
interested in development. For example, his studies on fin structure in bottom-
dwelling blenny fish have, as one of their objectives, the goal of
demonstrat[ing] that the developmental basis of evolutionary
novelties need not be studied in phylogenetically old and highly
complex organs, such as the vertebrate eye, where little
interspecific variation is available. The fin hooks are anatomically
simple and have all the attributes of a new morphological
character.303
                                                                                                                                                      
beyond the scope of this dissertation to enter it. However, this debate serves as
an excellent example of how different partitioning (and abstraction) criteria are
employed in organismal biology, the paradigmatic case of compositional biology.
I am currently working on a project exploring distinct notions of homology
stemming from distinct theoretical perspectives of compositional biology.

Note the use of structural terminology in the second sentence. Wagner develops
a narrative model of inhibitory and inductive interactions between different
regions of the fin304 from careful observation of development. His model is a
positive feedback model for fin hook305 development, in that the development of
each part of the fin assures (even through inhibition of the other parts) the
production of fin hooks.306 Although he does not make the connection explicit, his
discussion of the hypothetical role of mutations in this "epigenetic trap model"
indicates his view of (semiautonomous) genetic networks as causal of these
character complexes.307 Unfortunately, Wagner has not had further opportunities
to test this model.308 I consider his approach to modularity and homology as
primarily structural, because although he considers developmental mechanisms
and constraints explanatory of homology, what he seeks to explain is the
structural identity and individualization of morphological sets of characters
(caused by gene networks309) during development and evolution.310
Wagner's research on fins and fin hooks in blenniids provides a good
example of compositional biology as can be seen by inspecting how the four
                                                  
304 These are: fin web (the transparent material between "fingers" of the fin),
mesodermal ridge (the middle part of a cross-section of each "finger" of the fin),
and cuticula (the outer circumference layer of each "finger").

309 In this dissertation I have not discussed Hox genes and genetic networks due
to space constraints. I do think that research on genetic architecture and
regulation is crucial to evolutionary developmental biology and I take these
investigations as central cases of the integration perspective under compositional
biology – genes are here interpreted as multi-functional mechanistic components
of real material systems. The interested reader can consult Raff 1996; Gerhart and
Kirschner 1997; Hall 1998.

differentiae are met in this case.311 (1) The fins and fin hooks are, in fact, complex
objects with a developmental (and evolutionary) history, an adult structure and
physiology, and a function in the behavioral ecology of the fish – the hooks have
a history and multiple dispositional causes or capacities. (2) Even though some
properties of the fins and fin hooks seem to be necessary (i.e., the fin as
consisting of three components), much intra-, and inter-, specific variation is
allowed – this is why these component types are described very generally.
Furthermore, in inferring homologies even more variation and complex
abstraction will need to be allowed. (3) The models provided are both
diagrammatic and narrative. These are propositional non-mathematical models.
(4) There is a clear reference to the material compositional organization in
Wagner's research.
The work of these four key evolutionary developmental biologists
provides a good overview of the breadth of topics in this field. Although their
work combines guiding biases from various organismal biological sciences
(especially comparative anatomy and developmental biology), they each tend to
focus on, and employ, the biases, explored in Chapter 2, from the theoretical
perspective they were primarily trained in: molecular biology for Gerhart and
Kirschner, developmental biology for Raff, and comparative anatomy for
Wagner.312 Fitness and functional considerations are mostly absent. Genetic,
                                                  
311 Compare this to my discussion above of how Hamilton's rule met the four
differentiae for formal biology.
312 Rupert Riedl, an Austrian comparative anatomist with many interests, was
Wagner's Doktorvater. I will explore Riedl's structural hierarchy of the biological
world in Chapter 4. Wagner's work, in particular, is of significant interest
precisely because he tries to tie comparative anatomy, developmental biology,
and population genetics together so intimately. It is beyond the scope of this
dissertation to analyze his contributions.

structural, developmental, and phylogenetic analyses of parts (modules) are
ubiquitous.
3.3.4 Evolutionary Developmental Biology on Social Insect Colonies
I now want to make a seemingly paradoxical claim: the study of social
insect colonies can be interpreted as organismal biology. There is a long tradition
of thinking of social insect colonies as "superorganisms" dating at least to
Wheeler's famous article "The Ant-Colony as an Organism."313 Such colonies
present division of labor both between germ and soma as well as within the
soma, have a variety of well-defined structures, develop over time as a unit, and
are highly integrated with multiple kinds of communication processes (e.g.,
chemical and touch) as well as homeostatic mechanisms (colony physiology).
Here I will argue that because of these organismal features of social insect
colonies, an evolutionary developmental biology with them as the object of study
is possible and even desirable.
An evolutionary biologist once claimed that "evolution is the control of
development by ecology" (van Valen, 1973). A significant amount of work has
been done on the behavioral ecology of social insects.314 (For a detailed discussion
of the differences between Deborah Gordon's and E. O. Wilson's research
projects on the behavioral ecology of ant colonies, see Winther 2001c and 2003 in
press.) Thus, we have significant data on the ecological context in which social
insect evolution occurs. The competition perspective has also provided

voluminous information on evolutionary genetic aspects of insect societies, as we
began to see above. However, there is much less work on the development of
insect societies considered as physiologically-integrated wholes in an ecological
context. In other words, we know relatively little about the patterns and
processes of differential gene expression, and developmental pathways, of social
insect colony modules and colonies. An evolutionary developmental biology of
social insect colonies requires that we investigate this.
3.3.4.1 Colony Development and Physiology
Schneirla performed an early set of investigations into army ant colony-
development.315 Army ant colonies have two discrete alternating stages: nomadic
and statary. The 15-day nomadic stage of Eciton burchelli starts when a cohort of
adults have just eclosed from their pupal case and a distinct cohort of eggs have
just hatched into numerous hungry larvae (on the order of 100,000s) requiring
large amounts of food. The 20-day statary phase commences when these larvae
pupate. Ten days into the statary phase, the queen starts laying eggs again
(Appendix Figure 3.7). The timing of this 35-day cycle, with the synchronized
development of the two generations, is the result of multiple reciprocal chemical,
tactile, and nutritive interactions among queens, workers, and brood. Schneirla,
following Wheeler, called these interactions "trophallaxis."316
                                                  
315 Schneirla 1971.
316 Schneirla 1971; see Hölldobler and Wilson 1990, pp. 577-579 for a note of
skepticism regarding the validity of these multiple interactions as an explanation
for this cycle; consistent with their mainly context-independent interpretation of
behavior (see Winther 2001c, and 2003 in press), they focus on the role of the
queen in controlling this cycle.

Chapter 3

173
More detailed research on developmental integration of social insect
colonies has appeared subsequently.317 In her review of the different mechanisms
involved in reproductive-somatic caste determination, Diana Wheeler discusses
queen effects (parental manipulation) on (1) worker behavior, (2) larval
development, and (3) egg production or quality, or both (Appendix Figures 3.8
and 3.9).318 In bees and wasps, a queen pheromone affects the building of gyne
wax cells; the pheromone usually suppresses its construction. Furthermore,
larvae in gyne wax cells receive more food from workers. As a consequence of
this, they have higher levels of juvenile hormone (JH), which is necessary to
develop into a reproductive female. The production of JH contingent on nutrition
quantity is called a "nutritional switch." Further elaboration of organism and
colony physiology leading to reproductive caste differentiation in honeybees
(Apis mellifera) can be found in Hartfelder and Engels (1998). Similar mechanisms
involving pheromones, nutrition, and JH are found in ants despite the absence of
brood cells. A queen pheromone acts during a critical period of ant larval
development to induce the loss of the capacity of larvae to develop as gynes. This
inhibition occurs before the nutritional switch. Regarding egg production and
quality, the ant queen can control how many eggs she lays, which is, of course, a
function of how much nutrition she ingests, the temperature to which she is
exposed, and other factors. More importantly, the queen can allocate different
amounts of nutrition, mRNA, or hormones, or a combination of all three, to
different eggs. In Formica polycenta, for example, large eggs with relatively large

amounts of maternal mRNA develop into gynes.319 There are multiple strategies
available to hymenopteran queens and workers for reproductive caste
determination of the developing brood, as well as for worker caste
polymorphism320, not discussed here.
 The hymenopteran colony can be interpreted as an individual with
mechanisms of developmental differentiation. When evolutionary
developmental biology investigators study module differentiation in organisms,
they study patterns and processes of differential gene expression as, for example,
Raff and Davidson, with their respective co-workers, do in sea urchin
development. An evolutionary developmental biology of social insect
superorganisms requires a search for such patterns and processes in
hymenoptera. Recently, Evans and Wheeler have found reliable differences in
patterns of gene expression between honeybee workers and queens.321 They also
found that "several genes with caste-biased expression in honey bees show
sequence similarity to genes whose expression is affected by hormones in
Drosophila."322  Thus, hormones such as JH may be involved in differentially
activating genes correlated with morphological and physiological differences
between workers and queens.
Let me turn to an analogy with the developmental framework presented
in Chapter 2, and as summarized in Table 3. (2.1). The same kinds of
developmental modules found for organisms can be seen in social insect
colonies. Recall the distinction between parts involved in and parts causing the

process. The queens and workers constitute the "parts involved in (colony)
developmental activity."  They are the processual "parts" or "agents" that are
involved in the activity.  The genes that get differentially expressed (genes-D) are,
on the other hand, "parts causing the activity." On the other hand, the different
behaviors employed and performed by the queen and workers (e.g., pheromone
secretion and nutritional control) are "activity parts"; the cycle of the colony can
be partitioned into these different processual segments, with queens, workers,
larvae, and eggs all playing different roles. The parts causing, and the parts
involved in, activity, as well as the activity parts are all developmental modules.
Behavior is a crucial factor in colony development and physiology. In fact,
since behavior is usually attributed to an organism, and since ant-colonies are
composed of organisms, organisms and organism behavior become, as units and
mechanisms, respectively, parts of colony development and physiology.
Behavioral ecology of social insect colonies is thus a study of colony physiology.323
The same kinds of guiding biases pertinent to developmental biology and
physiology in organisms apply to those areas of study in social insects even if
they are not as well characterized. That is, the ontogeny of the colony is a
phenomenon separable from colony physiology, even if organismal behavior is
involved in both. The former has a temporal dimension and involves
characterizing the causes of differential gene expression, many of which occur
inside the nest; the latter tends to be studied at a time slice, particularly in the
mature colony and often involves the activity of ants outside of the nest. This
                                                  
323 Again, see the work of both Gordon and Wilson. Due to space constraints, I do
not review their work here. See in depth reviews in Winther 2001c and 2003 in
press. Some of Thomas Park's work on flour beetles was also explicitly
considered a study in population physiology.

corresponds accurately to the temporal and spatial biases of organismal
developmental biology and physiology, respectively. Gene Robinson and co-
workers have explicitly called for the study of "the molecular genetics of social
behaviour in ecologically relevant contexts."324 Their research program seeks to
synthesize processes involving gene expression, hormones, pheromones,
neurophysiology, behaviors, and ecology. They want to do this by "Focusing on
genes [which] provides a common language and convergent research themes."325
Whether a synthetic theory of colony integration (developmentally and
physiologically) requires a genetic focus merits further discussion.
3.3.4.2 Is an Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Social Insect
Colonies Possible?
Thus, in the last 15 years, several biologists have investigated the
developmental and physiological mechanisms of social insect colonies. This
application of the integration perspective has similarities to the evolutionary
developmental biology synthesis that has been occurring at the organism level. Is
an evolutionary developmental biology of social insect colonies possible? Clearly
differential gene expression of colony-modules has been found. But this does not
necessarily imply that we can consider social insect colonies individuals when it
comes to assessing module homologies, establishing ancestral and derived
colony-level developmental patterns, describing the origin of colony-level
innovations, and linking organismic change in characters with large-scale colony

evolution.326 Progress, however, has been made on some of these aspects of the
evolutionary developmental biology of social insect colonies. Colony-level
properties such as nest morphology have been used in determining robust
phylogenetic trees in wasps327; some superorganismal modules can therefore be
used for establishing homologies. Furthermore, Anderson and McShea argue
that organs, or "intermediate-scale structures", such as teams (workers adopting
different sub-tasks in order to perform a task – e.g. carrying a prey item) and
nests, exist in social insect colonies.328 These and the other results discussed in
this section on social insect colonies indicate that an evolutionary developmental
biology of social insect colonies is possible. We should embark on such a project,
which would also involve a conceptual investigation of the individuality of social
insect colonies. Conclusions from this research would provide data, at a new
hierarchical level, that would facilitate further conceptual developments in
evolutionary developmental biology in general.
Thus, we have seen that these two theoretical perspectives at the
disciplinary/school of thought level can be applied to the same biological
systems, organisms and social insects, even if there is more work on the levels of
selection in social insects and the evolutionary developmental biology of
organisms. The domains of units studied by these theoretical perspectives thus
overlap. But levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology
abstract very differently. The two theoretical perspectives abstract the same
objects in fundamentally different ways (e.g., materially complex homologues vs.
formally simple replicator genes), have radically different methodologies (e.g.,

knocking out genes and vs. constructing mathematical models), and provide
different model-types for these biological systems (e.g., mathematical models,
such as Hamilton's rule, vs. propositional non-mathematical models, such as
Wagner's model of fin hook development in blenniids). Furthermore, the levels
of selection perspective has a highly ideal frame of partitioning329 that provides
the replicator as well as the gene-molecule-cell-organism-group-species-clade
interactor hierarchy.330 Thus, the two perspectives differ in how they abstract and
how they partition.
Let us now turn to an elaborate discussion of the many deep ways in
which they differ and what we should think about the possibility of synthesizing
them.
3.4 On the Prospects of a Synthesis
In exploring details of the theory, practices, and data of levels of selection
theory and evolutionary developmental biology, I hope to have made two
general points: (1) these two disciplines /schools of thought differ in their
epistemic and methodological resources in ways to which I will presently turn
and (2) they partly overlap in the units and general processes that they study and
interpret. As we shall see, there is a subtle interplay of similarity and difference
between these two theoretical perspectives and there is, therefore, a variety of
                                                  
329 Recall from Chapter 2 that the partitioning frame of a perspective contains
criteria allowing for the conceptual and actual decomposition of the system
under study.
330 Again, see Appendix Figure (Table) 3.1.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
179
interpretations about how these perspectives actually relate. After some
preliminary discussion, I will turn to four such interpretations.
These theoretical perspectives differ in the epistemic and methodological
resources that they apply in their explanations and descriptions. First, they differ
with regard to my four distinctions, which I will explore one at a time.331
(1) Even when they study the same objects (e.g., genes) they interpret and
model them, respectively, as simple (e.g., mathematically-defined "genes")
or complex (e.g., phylogenetically-conditioned regulatory genes).
Furthermore, evo-devo studies the "somatic" or "phenotypic" complex
parts of organisms and social insect colonies—with a structure,
development, and physiology—in a way not focused on by levels of
selection theory (although see Buss).
(2) They make distinct idealizing assumptions about their respective
objects of study and they abstract them differently. Levels of selection
theory employs necessary and sufficient conditions in defining the precise
variables and parameters employed by its principled biological
mathematical models, whereas evolutionary developmental biology
employs complex "family resemblance" abstraction in picking out the
types that it represents in its qualitative immediate models. Even though
typology is crucial to evo-devo332, recognition and bottom-up abstraction
                                                  
331 I.e., (1) attention to simple versus complex objects, (2) employment of simple
versus complex abstraction, (3) usage of mathematical models versus material
and propositional non-mathematical models, and (4) consideration of part-whole
organization as irrelevant and highly idealized or relevant.
332 See Amundson 1998, 2001 on the importance of essentialist thinking in
developmental biology. Topics like homology and developmental constraint
revolve around such  concerns. See both Amundson's work and Winther 2001 for

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
180
of such ideal types is a highly contingent process based on qualitative
assessments of similarities among the (overlapping) intentional sets of
properties ascribed to different concrete parts eventually judged as "of the
same kind."333 Such contingency does not exist in the precisely defined
mathematical variables and parameters of formal biology.
(3) Each perspective employs model-types that are fundamentally distinct.
The former employs principled mathematical biology models often based
on axioms and clear simple assumptions. Much of the model-building
here is based on abstract mathematical principles (including "laws") and
logical operations. Compositional biology tends to use mainly material
and propositional non-mathematical models that refer directly to the
material compositional structure of the system at hand. It does on
occasion employ mathematical models, but these, as discussed in
Chapters 1 and 2, are often highly complex and refer intimately to part-
organization.
(4) Thus, while formal biology is concerned primarily with (mathematical)
abstraction, compositional biology emphasizes the articulated part
organization of complex biological systems. Levels of selection theory
either makes parts irrelevant (as in its lack of interest in somatic or
phenotypic parts) or highly idealizes them, as in the case of epistatic
genes. Evolutionary developmental biology is, however, clearly about
concrete parts.
                                                                                                                                                      
discussion of the importance of variation and commonality, respectively, for
levels of selection theory and evo-devo.
333 Recall complex Wittgenstein-Boyd "family resemblance" abstraction as
articulated in Chapter 1.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
181
The perspectives also differ in the explanatory resources they employ.334 This
term encompasses a variety of things, including the model-types employed
(third distinction) by the perspective, cases of which I have discussed above.335
But explanatory resources also include (1) the contrast classes considered
relevant in an explanation336, (2) the meanings of terms employed, (3) the
research questions asked, and (4) the broad aims of the explanations (e.g.,
theoretical unification in the case of theoretical explanation, or, in the case of
                                                  
334 I found Amundson 2001 particularly thought-provoking regarding these
matters. In comparing the "lack of common ground" between adaptationist
functionalists and developmental structuralists, he "offer[s] a sketch of the
contrast between these two kinds of evolutionary explanation. Adaptationist
explanations depict evolution as changes to what I will call the current genetic
state of a population, with selective forces fully accounted for but the current
genetic state itself assumed as an unexplained background condition…
Structuralist explanations depict evolution as changes to the processes that give rise
to phenotypes, with those developmental processes fully accounted for at each
step but selective forces assumed as unexplained background conditions. There
are shortcomings to each approach. The structuralist approach ignores selection,
and so it contains no account of the motor of evolutionary change… On the other
hand, by treating the current genetic state as mere background the adaptationist
account ignores the biases in available variation that are created by the existing
developmental system." (Amundson 2001, 323) Thus, the explanans and the
explandanda, as well as the explanatory background varies drastically between
these two fields, which correspond, roughly to formal and compositional biology
as represented, for example, in levels of selection theory and evolutionary
developmental biology. The main disanalogy, however, lies in what I take to be
the lack of explicit focus on adaptation, or selective function (sensu Wright 1973),
in population genetics. This does sound rather odd, but population genetics is
not, per se, focused on the function of particular parts. It is focused on the forces,
one of which is selection, that change gene frequency. Perhaps we can think of
particular genes as adaptations for particular purposes, but usually we think of
characters (components of the interactor) as carrying function. I will here
postpone a full discussion of the relation between adaptation/function and
formal biology.
335 E.g., Hamilton's rule and Wagner's model of fin hook development in
blenniids.
336 See van Fraassen 1989 on the pragmatics of explanation, as well as Dretske
1972; Garfinkel 1981; Sober 1986; Mitchell 1992; van der Weele 1995; Amundson
2001.

causal explanation, part capacity ascription or causal inference; these will be
discussed in Chapter 5). The set of explanatory resources that a perspective
employs is a complex battery of theoretical and methodological guiding biases
and assumptions. Amundson has described how the contrast classes and
meanings of a few key terms337 differ in population genetics and developmental
biology. I have not and shall not be concerned with the contrast class issue,
although I think that it is important.  I have shown that meanings of (general)
terms, included under the "outward-interaction" and "inward-independence"
distinction, do differ drastically between the two perspectives. Under the
competition perspective, cooperation is described in terms of ultimate fitness
benefits (i.e., gene "copy" maximization) accrued from population structure (i.e.,
kin group) whereas in the integration perspective, integration is defined in terms
of mechanistic interaction that ensures the functional integration of the whole. I
shall address the issue of questions asked separately below.
With respect to the last aspect of explanatory resources here discussed, to
be elaborated upon in Chapter 5, it is clear that the general aims of explanation
differ in the two kinds of biology. In the case of levels of selection theory as a
formal biology, one aim is theoretical unification through mathematical means.338
The equivalent of a "grand unified theory" for the forces and dynamics of gene
frequency change is sometimes sought.339 Evolutionary developmental biology,
as an instance of compositional biology, intends to describe the capacities of the
                                                  
337 E.g., "constraint" and "evolution." See also Amundson and Lauder 1994 on
different notions of function.
338 On theoretical unification, see Friedman 1974, 1981, 1983; Kitcher 1991 (1981),
1985.
339 Some consider the Price Equation one way of achieving the goal of theoretical
unification; see Wade 1985; Frank 1997, 1998.

Chapter 3

183
parts it investigates. The goal here is to disaggregate the different kinds of
behaviors of a system (the whole) in terms of component capacities of the
parts.340 Theoretical unification and part capacity ascription are distinct
explanatory aims to be discussed in Chapter 5.
But if these perspectives were completely different, there would be little
motivation to address both of them at the same time or even worry about their
relationship. We could merely ascribe them to different ontological domains, such
as was done, and entrenched, by the formulation and highly complex
interpretation of a variety of distinctions such as Mendels' factors and characters,
Weismann's germ and soma, Johannsen's genotype and phenotype, Morgan's
transmissional and developmental genetics, Mayr's proximate and ultimate, and
Hull's and Dawkins' distinction between the replicator and interactor. Although
this is by no means an actually universal interpretation, nor could it even be a
monolithic interpretation, the former term in each pair refers to the processes of
variation-heredity-development-reproduction (production of units!) whereas the
latter term refers to, or is pertinent to, selection.  There are feedback effects
between the two classes of terms, but this is the basic general distinction. For
example, Amundson has shown how these distinctions played a historical role in
entrenching differences between fields concerned, respectively, with
evolutionary and developmental phenomena.341 According to these classic
distinctions, compositional biology (concrete production of units) and formal
biology (selection in populations of idealized units) belong to distinct ontological
domains.

What is of supreme interest now is that despite the difference in
representational and explanatory resources, the two (hierarchies of) theoretical
perspectives now partly overlap in ontological domain. That is, tools used to
analyze populations are now applied to, for example, cell lineages
(developmental phenomena) – thereby interpreting them as populations.
Conversely, tools used to examine the production of units are now implemented
in, for example, social insects and constraints on genetic variation (usually
considered the domain of evolutionary studies). Furthermore, each of the
respective disciplines (that is, levels of selection theory and evolutionary
developmental biology) now understand that they must take the preferred
domains of the other fields seriously – formal evolutionary studies cannot ignore
development, and compositional developmental studies cannot ignore the force
of selection342. The fields can continue to provide their own definitions of
function and structure [as in Table 4. (3.1) below], but a complex overlap of
domain is occurring and it is this hybrid zone of formal and compositional
theory applied to developmental and evolutionary phenomena, respectively, that
a synthesis may or may not happen.
                                                  
342 Although compositional developmental studies have endorsed phylogeny as an
evolutionary aspect, they have yet to come to peace with the relevance of the
force of selection.

But as it stands, I argue, the two perspectives are ill-equipped to deal with
this partial overlap in domain. That is, their extreme differences have not yet
been clearly articulated, let alone overcome. As a community of biologists and
philosophers of biology, we currently desire to develop an integrated account of
the relationship between levels of selection theory and evolutionary
developmental biology, but in order to do this, it is not enough that those
employing each of the two different hierarchies of perspective investigate the
similar phenomena. We must also consider whether and how the serious
differences in representational and explanatory resources can be accommodated
or synthesized under one meta-perspective, through theoretical and

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
186
methodological (1) integration, (2) translation, and/or (3) complementation.343 A
full account of this is beyond the scope of my dissertation. I can only provide
some suggestions for how this might be done, and speculate about whether it can
even be done.
In what follows, I elaborate on four different interpretations of how levels
of selection theory relates to evolutionary developmental biology, the key
relationship indicated by the big question mark toward the bottom of Figure 1.
(3.1). The four interpretations are named according to how they foresee a
"synthesis" between the two hierarchies of theoretical perspectives happening (or
not). I will turn to each interpretation in turn, but here I first want to indicate the
properties of each vis-à-vis the above discussion.
The four interpretations I present are: (1) the explanatory exclusivity
interpretation, (2) the two domains interpretation, (3) the two kinds of biology
interpretation, and (4) the eventual convergence interpretation [see Table 5.
(3.2)]. The first three interpretations all argue that the two hierarchies of
perspectives rely on different explanatory resources; the last argues that some sort
                                                  
343 There is some philosophical literature on "scientific controversies," in addition
to the more extensive sociology of science literature on this topic, which I will not
touch here. Kitcher 2000 in Machamer et al. discusses the beginnings, middles,
and ends of scientific controversies under "rationalist" (evidence determines
outcome) and "anti-rationalist" (epistemologies determine outcomes) models.
Kitcher does not capture the richly pragmatic and relativistic nature of scientific
debates. I do not think that the debate I am analyzing here can be couched in
rationalist or anti-rationalist terms or that a single account stemming from one of
the hierarchies will triumph and be shown to be "true." Perhaps a meta-
theoretical perspective will be found between the two hierarchies of theoretical
perspectives that I describe, but the resolution to this grand controversy will not
be based on "data" favoring one perspective over another. The situation is more
complex. Sociological models of scientific controversy and their resolutions, such
as Gerson's notion of theory realignment (Gerson 1998), are better able to
describe the theoretical richness of the debates and differences between the two
hierarchies that I am describing in this chapter.

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
187
of integration, translation, and/or complementation of explanatory resources is
possible between them. The second interpretation argues that different processes
are studied by formal and compositional biology; the third and fourth
interpretation argues the opposite – the same or overlapping units and processes
are studied in the two kinds of biology. The first interpretation is indeterminate
on this point, being either agnostic or agreeing with the second interpretation.
Two further "character-states" can be looked at to differentiate the
interpretations that argue that the explanatory resources are different (1-3). First,
do they hold that the difference in resources leads to tension or to mutual ignoring
between perspectives? The first interpretation argues the former, the second and
third interpretation argues for the latter. Second, what do they consider the
source of the explanatory differences to be? In the second interpretation, but also,
I suspect, in the first, the source is interpreted as being the classic distinctions of
Mendel, Weismann, etc. mentioned above, which are commitments about the
ontology of the biological world. In the third interpretation, and this is one way
that I think my analysis aids understanding, the source is taken to be differences
in kinds of science, i.e., differences not so much in commitments about ontology,
but rather, differences in primarily epistemic commitments about abstraction,
model-building, relevance of part-whole organization, and explanatory
resources.344 In a sense, this chapter, and dissertation more generally, has been a
defense of this third interpretation. I certainly do not want to argue either that
the classic distinctions are free of epistemic commitments or that, even if mainly
                                                  
344 Let me underscore the ontology/epistemology point: Mendel, Weismann, etc.
studied, of course, biology and so they formulated ontological (domain)
distinctions. As a philosopher of biology, I study theories of biology and so I
develop (primarily) epistemological and methodological distinctions.

Chapter 3

ontological, they play no role in the differences between levels of selection theory
or evolutionary developmental biology. But I do hold that my analysis of formal
and compositional biology provides a new framework that allows us to see the
epistemic differences between these two disciplines/schools of thought in a new
and cogent light.

Table 5. (3.2) The four interpretations on the relationship between levels of
selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology compared with respect
to a variety of issues as discussed in the text. "TPs" means "theoretical
perspectives."
Let us now turn to the differing interpretations of the relationships
between levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology.
(1) The explanatory exclusivity interpretation. Some researchers believe that the
kinds of processes adopted by biologists in the two theoretical perspectives
contradict, or are in conceptual conflict, with one another. For example, some key
investigators of evolutionary developmental biology hold that the idea of multi-

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
189
level selection, particularly in developmental processes, is incoherent and not
explanatory, in any sense, of development (e.g., Raff and Wolpert; Wagner, to a
much lesser extent, also holds this view345). Some competition perspective
workers believe that development can be black-boxed as long as the path from
genotype to phenotype is reliable (and a change in genotype leads to a change in
phenotype) – in fact the statistical and probabilistic edifice of mathematical
evolutionary genetics is premised on attempts to eliminate developmental
considerations and decompose the phenotype directly into the genotype
(statistical quantitative genetics) or assign fitness values directly to genotypes
(probabilistic population genetics). (Proponents of levels of selection theory do
often emphasize gene interactions, as Wright did – this is not exactly the same,
however, as focusing on developmental dynamics per se.) The explanatory
exclusivity interpretation thus claims that: (1) development is not in need of any
evolutionary (selective) explanation, or (2) development need not be taken into
account in explaining evolution, or both. This interpretation thus describes a case
where each theoretical perspective rejects the explanatory strategies and even the
ontological domains of the other. The perspectives are explanatorily exclusive
(what I have previously called the "irreconcilable" view346). This is not, and
cannot lead to, a synthesis in any way. It is a welcome change that increasingly
more levels of selection investigators are taking developmental (and epigenetic)
effects more seriously. Unfortunately, the converse cannot be said for
evolutionary developmental biology workers with respect to multi-level

selection processes. However, as we shall see, it is incorrect to claim that the
views are in actuality or in principle in tension.
(2) The two domains interpretation. Although an explanatory tension can
sometimes be explicitly read from the work of some investigators such as Raff or
Wolpert, the more common interpretation of the relation between levels of
selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology is that the two concern
different sets of biological processes. This interpretation has a strong historical
lineage. Many of the orthodox distinctions "fundamental" to a conceptual
account of biology, with roots in Mendel's and Weismann's work, such as (1)
reproduction-selection, (2) proximate-ultimate, (3) replicator-interactor, and (4)
integration/cooperation-competition imply a "separate but equal" view of each
contrasting member of each distinction. The general picture here seems to be that
there are two distinct explanatory projects in biology: (1) explaining the
similarity relations, development, and reproduction of units (the former member
of each distinction) and (2) explaining the selection and inter-generational change
of these units, in populations of (mathematically idealized) units, over time (the
latter member of each distinction). The Modern Synthesis consecrated these
distinctions. However, in the last decade or two, there has been a move to undo
the distinctions both through biological work in levels of selection theory and
evolutionary developmental biology as well as through various philosophical
arguments. But we have not gotten very far in undoing these entrenched
distinctions (and it still remains unclear whether we should undo them). If levels
of selection theory and evolutionary developmental theory are really two
different domains then it is unclear what a synthesis between them would even

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
191
be. Presumably a synthesis breaks down distinctions. But in the two domains
interpretation, a synthesis would be, at best, a plea for both processes to be
considered theoretically, economically, and socially important. It is hard to see
how this is an actual synthesis.
This interpretation too has problems. Above, I have shown how each
perspective investigates two kinds of biological units, organisms and social
insects, so they concern similar overlapping domains. However, perhaps
someone could claim that the two perspectives concern different aspects of the
same units. But, Buss, for example, interpreted developmental mechanisms from
a levels of selection point of view, and some of these interpretations have been
kept. Furthermore, as argued above, selective and ultimate phenomena can
certainly also be interpreted from an evolutionary developmental biology point
of view – functional morphology, for example, is used to ascribe adaptation to
parts of organisms. So, although it has been enshrined almost as dogma, the two
domains scenario is not a robust interpretation either.
(3) The two kinds of biology interpretation. In the two interpretations already
discussed, there was an implicit assumption that the two perspectives were
different kinds of biology. In this third interpretation, this fact is emphasized
along with the potential synthesis [contra (1)] and domain overlap [contra (2)] of
the two perspectives. This interpretation claims that the biases regarding
abstraction, model-building, relevance of part-whole organization, and
explanatory resources are so different in each of the two theoretical perspectives

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
192
that no synthesis in terms of more abstract framework can (ever) be had.347 The
point of this interpretation is that evolutionary developmental biology and levels
of selection are different kinds of science. The two sciences will always remain
apart unless a concerted and explicit attempt is made by conceptually-oriented
biologists and philosophers of biology to articulate ways to bring compositional
biology and formal biology together. My dissertation provides descriptions of
these deep differences. I believe that this interpretation describes the current
situation in which we find ourselves.
(4) The eventual convergence interpretation. The future is, of course, very difficult
to predict. I am convinced, however, and hope to have shown, that there is as of
yet no actual synthesis, even remotely, between levels of selection theory and
evolutionary developmental biology. I see one of my goals as convincing
biologists and philosophers that if we declare the existence of such a synthesis
this is equivalent in truth-value to the declarations of the emperor in Hans
Christian Andersen's fairy tale. A deep divide exists between the competition
and integration perspectives. Now, either I am wrong (and such a synthesis
exists) or I am right and I hope to motivate others to think about whether such a
synthesis is possible, and, if so, how. Here I will sketch three areas of
investigation potentially pertinent for achieving such a synthesis. These are
                                                  
347 I am aware of the notoriety of statements of the form "X can never happen in
science" – this was said about electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, and
Kant erroneously said 69 years before the Origin of Species that "it is absurd for
men… to hope that maybe another Newton may some day arise, to make
intelligible to us even the genesis of but a blade of grass from natural laws that
no design has ordered." (Kant 1953 (1790). There is an irony, though: Darwin did
not actually provide laws for the production of units; he provided the grounds for
laws for the selection of units. Until the advent of developmental biology and
molecular genetics in the 20th century, Kant was right.

extremely preliminary suggestions – one person's imagination, however, should
not limit the work of a whole field of superb philosophers and biologists.
First, the concept of genetic information has received an increasing amount
of attention in recent years.348 As an important part of their argument concerning
evolutionary transitions, Maynard Smith and Száthmary argue that the
important evolutionary transitions are the ones for which there were new ways
of transmitting (genetic) information.349 Griesemer rightly points out that this is a
distinct focus from the focus on structural (compositional) hierarchy.350 He
argues that translations among these two forms of hierarchy, and the process
hierarchy, which he favors with his "reproducer" concept, should be articulated. A
significant amount of research is required to relate these hierarchy concepts.
The idea of information transfer and the idea of hierarchy are related in
discussions regarding transitions in evolution. The concept of information is a
particularly suggestive place to explore relationships between the two kinds of
biology articulated in this chapter since "genetic" and other forms of information
could be thought of as either (1) statistical measurements of the relationships
among genotype, phenotype, and fitness (for levels of selection theory) or (2)
summaries of mechanisms or causal capacities (for evolutionary developmental
biology). Theoretical integration of these concepts, particularly for the period
during which evolutionary transitions occur, can and should be explored
particularly since causal capacities do have a direct effect on fitness (and are

summarized that way) and fitness can be fleshed out, if a mathematical
evolutionary geneticist should care to do so, in terms of, for example, genetic,
developmental, and ecological mechanisms. As Griesemer puts it: "because
transition is an evolutionary process, the hierarchy that results is a product of
evolution, not an assumption in need of independent justification. Evolution
generates transitions and transitions create hierarchy."351 Studying the hierarchy
itself, and the different ways that information is transmitted among units at a
particular level in the hierarchy, gives us a glimpse into how the generative
mechanisms of the units, and selective dynamics of populations of units, relate. It
is important to keep in mind criticisms regarding the whole idea of
information352, but this still seems like a provocative place to start thinking about
the relationship between formal and compositional biology.
Second, higher levels of selection, such as the species and clade selection353,
might also be a good place to consider the potential interrelationships between
levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology. This is a topic
that I have sidestepped here because of space constraints. There are mechanisms
that are positively correlated with speciation, such as the existence of a high
degree of population structure in marine invertebrates that brood their young
rather than disperse their eggs and sperm – these species will tend to have more
inter-population variation and will therefore speciate faster than species that
have large panmictic populations.354 These mechanisms, Lloyd and Gould (1993)

argue, are traits whose variation is correlated with variation in "emergent
fitnesses" of the species. Alternatively, Damuth and Heisler have an entirely
different view of species selection in which evolutionary change is driven by
selection between guilds of competing species.355 This can be interpreted as a
community ecology approach. Both Lloyd and Gould's, as well as Damuth and
Heisler's, views could be of use in articulating a synthesis involving mechanisms
and selection at levels higher than the group.
Third, selection and integration are particularly clearly interrelated in
multicellular organisms. A thought-provoking paper that is suggestive of issues
requiring consideration in synthesizing levels of selection theory and
evolutionary developmental biology is Gilbert's piece on the relevance of Buss'
argument to developmental biology. Gilbert provides a historical account of
critiques of Weismannism.356 He also discusses at length "the notion that the cell
lineage can be a unit of selection," which is, he claims, "a particularly robust idea
that I do not want to dismiss."357 His analysis of assumptions regarding concepts
and metaphors underlying the notion of cell lineage competition focuses on what
he considers the "western" notions of unit independence, self-reliance, and
economic competition between units. Gilbert interprets, and finds fault with,
Buss' view as one of independent cell lineages attempting to assert their
economic-theory-like selfish interests by cooperating with other types of cell
lineages.358 Gilbert puts forth his view that "the units of selection [are]
                                                  
355 Damuth and Heisler 1988.
356 See also Griesemer and Wimsatt 1989; Winther 2001b.
357 Gilbert 1992, p. 481.
358 Gilbert thus seems to interpret Buss as a Dawkins for which the cell is the
replicator. Gilbert seems to imply that the following quote by Dawkins could
have been written by Buss: "The integrated multicellular organism is a

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
196
sociocentric, relational, contextualist, and holistic as opposed to being egocentric,
individualist, selfish, and autonomous."359 He certainly does not want to deny
cell lineages the status of units of selection, but he does take issue with their
representation, in his opinion, as selfish and independent agents (replicators or
interactors?) in the evolutionary process, both during and after the transition to
multicellularity.
Biochemical evidence for the similarity of structure, process, and function
of cell-surface proteins used in fertilization (both of isogametic protists, which
presumably resemble our single-celled ancestors, and heterogametic sperm-egg)
and embryonic inductive events serve as evidence for his claim that units of
selection, cell lineages, are interdependent (i.e., have cell membrane structures
and processes essential for communication). It is in these cases that
we see that those cells which gave rise to multicellular organisms,
rather than being solely selfish replicators, are also outer-directed
cooperators. As much as they 'want' autonomy and dominance,
they also 'want' to interact. As much as they have the mitotic
apparatus driving them to proliferate, they have a cell membrane
that drives them to communicate. The same genome that instructs
cell division instructs cell interactions.360
I think that Gilbert's analysis, although suggestive and of extreme interest
for prospects of a synthesis, is problematic. It conflates three separate
distinctions: (1) what I have called the competition and integration theoretical
perspectives, (2) "outward-interaction" and "inward-independence," which are
                                                                                                                                                      
phenomenon which has emerged as a result of natural selection on primitively
independent selfish replicators. It has paid replicators to behave gregariously. …
In practice the organism has arisen as a partially bounded local concentration, a
shared knot of replicator power" (Dawkins 1982, p. 264). I think that this is a
misreading of Buss, particularly if one examines Buss' arguments against genic
selectionism as represented, for example, in footnote 248.

defined differently, but exist as concepts, in each of the two perspectives, and (3)
reductionism and holism. In previous work, I have explicated in great detail
why, in particular, (1) and (3) are not the same distinction.361 There are holists in
the competition perspective (e.g., Buss and Wade) and there are reductionists in
the integration perspective (e.g., proponents of the Human Genome Project, such
as Walter Gilbert). Furthermore, Gilbert does not clearly distinguish the
explanatory resources in the two perspectives that he is trying to synthesize. A
proponent of the competition perspective could easily say that rates of cell
division summarize the effect on fitness of all the mechanisms, described as
independent or interdependent. Such an investigator would simply not care
about the mechanisms. They want to measure fitness, even if it is hierarchically or
interactively, or both, determined.362 In his focus on integrative mechanisms,
rather than dynamics of gene frequency changes, Gilbert, it could be argued,
simply misses the crucial explanatory project of the competition perspective.
However, his views certainly deserve more consideration – his analysis of the
use of metaphor in theory and practice construction in the two perspectives
described in my chapter is important.
The difficulty of bridging the two (hierarchies of) perspectives can also be
seen in a recent article Gilbert wrote, entitled "Evo-Devo, Devo-Evo, and
Devgen-Popgen." In this article he notes, without evidence, that,
…not all parts of developmental biology and not all parts of
evolutionary biology are involved in these new unions. What is
happening, I believe, is a series of interactions occurring between
                                                  
361 Winther 2003 in press. See in particular tables 1 and 2 in that paper.
362 There are also clear ways to model and measure fitness provisioning versus
fitness reception among interacting units. See Queller 1992b; Frank 1997, 1998;
Wolf and Wade 2001.

population genetic models of evolution and developmental genetic
models of evolution. Both of these models emphasize genes. But in
one case, evolution depends upon the frequency of gene variants
within a population. In the other case, evolution depends on
variations of gene expression between populations. As Ron
Amundson has noted, the new union might be characterized as
"devgen-popgen"; the genes are not going away when these models
are synthesized.363
This is a provocative passage. Gilbert and Amundson are the two
commentators on evo-devo who have done some work on relating the two
disciplines/schools of thought that I discuss. But Gilbert does not present
evidence for the interaction of these models or even how such interaction
would occur. The remainder of his article discusses either which
disciplines of compositional biology, to import my term, belong in
evolutionary developmental biology or how genes are an important causal
agent. He does not discuss the synthesis that would answer the question
mark in my diagram. I do not blame him. The task is difficult and before
attempting a synthesis, we have to clarify the severe differences between
the two hierarchies of theoretical perspectives; this chapter is an attempt
to do so.
3.5 A Literary Analogy
In this chapter, I have shown how the two theoretical perspectives
described differ in very deep ways. Although ontology is now, to an
extent, shared, methodological and epistemic commitments, as described
                                                  
363 Gilbert 2003, p. 348 (his emphasis).

Chapter 3
On the Prospects of Synthesis
199
in my four distinctions from Chapter 1, differ radically. Furthermore, even
in studying the same or overlapping units and processes, both (hierarchies
of) theoretical perspectives employ distinct explanatory resources, such as
the pertinent contrast classes, the vocabulary, the research questions
posed, and the general goals of explanation.
I am of two minds about the prospects of synthesis. Sometimes I adopt the
two kinds of biology interpretation and think that the ways practitioners in each
respective hierarchy think about and do science is so fundamentally different that
finding translation principles, as well as common (1) vocabulary, (2) abstraction
tools, and (3) explanatory resources is well-nigh impossible. For example,
consider Gilbert's efforts at synthesis. Despite his laudable efforts he is still
thoroughly situated in one hierarchy—one way—of understanding biology. How
can the two sides ever understand one another?
At other times I adopt the eventual convergence interpretation and believe
that a real synthesis is possible. But it will not be easy. We must first, like Dante
in the Divine Comedy, realize that we first have to tread through a philosophical
morass—a hell—before we can achieve this synthesis. The work on (genetic)
information and levels of selection above the group provide hints of synthesis.
But I remain unsure of how this will unfold. In this chapter, and in the
dissertation in general, I hope to provide some guiding principles for moving
through the philosophical hell. If I can just be one commentator who plays the
role of Virgil, I will be satisfied. I certainly leave the role of Beatrice to others,
even if there is a heaven—a synthesis—to be reached.

Chapter 4: Models and Modeling in Formal and Compositional Biology
4.1 Framing and Goals
The concept of a "model" is a rich one. It seems to be unproblematic to say
that scientists, and biologists in particular, seek to represent the dynamics (i.e.,
causes as well as objects and processes) of systems in terms of simplified,
generalized, and idealized models. Science seeks both to represent and intervene,
and, as we shall see, it does both of these through models. But (1) how to
articulate the relation between a model and a theory and (2) how to define all the
pertinent properties that a "theoretical unit" must have in order to be considered
a proper model are two difficult tasks. There are no simple, or even consensus,
views on these issues. Here what I will do is to present the basic version of a
model as portrayed by the semantic view of theories. By comparing this version
with the account of models from the "mediating model view," and
complementing the comparison with concepts from both Cartwright's and
Friedman's work on physical laws in addition to Griesemer's and Downes' work
on non-standard models, I develop a list of the general properties any model
must have.
Some of these properties, in particular those concerned with the
explanatory power of a model will be interpreted as anathema to the views of at
least some advocates of the semantic view who claim that science does not do

any "explaining" – i.e., that explanation is not a proper, or actual, part of scientific
work.364 I describe this view in more detail in Chapter 5. I believe that models
serve important roles in scientific explanation, and, as I will argue in Chapter 5,
the two different kinds of biology use their respectively different models and
model-types to serve different patterns, or what I shall call "pictures," of
explanation.
My presentation of models is but a sketch. But if I am successful at my
goal, I will be able to present a notion of model sufficiently general to account for
the different models and model-types used in both formal biology and
compositional biology. Formal biology tends to employ mathematical models,
which specify transitions through a mathematically-defined state space;
compositional biology tends to use non-mathematical models that refer to the
compositional structure and capacity of concrete systems. The advantage to my
"generalizing" methodology is that I will be able to develop a notion of model
sufficiently robust to account for an incredibly diverse range of types of model-
types. Subsequently to developing this framework, I will flesh out some of the
model-types ubiquitous in compositional biology (e.g., scale, remnant,
diagrammatic, and narrative).

4.2 General Properties of Models
In this section, I want to present the general properties of a model. In
order to achieve such a generalization, I explore two different views on models,
the semantic view of theories and the mediating model view, and also contrast
these positions with Griesemer's and Downes' unorthodox accounts of models.
This analysis, together with some considerations stemming from Cartwright's
and Friedman's respective ideas on modeling trade-offs, allow me to articulate
the general properties, which I will then use, in the subsequent section, to
evaluate particular models from compositional biology.
4.2.1 Models According to the Semantic View of Theories
One powerful and widespread view on models is the semantic view of
theories. This view holds that a theory is a family (or, more generally, a hierarchy
of families) of formal mathematical models. These models are presentations and
interpretations of various axioms and assumptions (including assumptions about
the state-space type365). But, "in a semantic definition, the set of sentences that are
theorems of the theory is not defined by interpreting a set of axioms, but through
directly defining the class of structures."366 That is, although models (at various
levels of abstraction) require axioms and assumptions, these source aspects of the
models are not the central aspects of theory. Theory is fundamentally about the

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
203
actual class of theoretical mathematical structures—models—represented as
possible trajectories in a chosen state space pertinent to the purposes and subject
matter ("intended scope"367) of that theory.
The semantic view was designed to explicitly contrast with the axiomatic
and logic-driven focus on sentences and Laws of the so-called syntactic view of
the logical positivists and logical empiricists.368 The syntactic biases of this school
were their biases to formalize, and unify, the propositions of (all of) science in
first-order logic. But this syntactic view falls prey to various problems: the very
large, in fact, infinite, number of models consistent with any set of logically-
formulated laws, the inability to deal with unpleasant consequences of the
arbitrary conjunction of laws as well as with the problem of relevance, the
apparent explanatory symmetry of laws, the contentious distinction between
observational and theoretical terms and entities, and the lack of fit between
logical formalizations of theory and how scientists actually represent theoretical
knowledge in their day-to-day theoretical activity.369 Because of its completely
different focus (on models of, with, and in, mathematical state spaces), the
semantic view does not run into any of these problems.
                                                  
367 Suppe 1977, p. 223.
368 Here is not the place to do history. I remain agnostic about many points in the
history of this topic. And I certainly do not want to claim that logical positivists
and logical empiricism cannot provide us with any useful philosophical insights.
See for example the recent work by, among others, Creath and Friedman
showing how the positivists and empiricists, particularly people like Carnap, got
some things "right." In this dissertation, however, I do adopt the biases of the
semantic view insofar as they are focused on models. As we shall see, however,
there are other ways to cash out the notion of models and there are even
legitimate formulations of laws.
369 These, and other, problems with the syntactic view cannot be further
discussed here. Again, the reader is referred to other literature on this topic. See,
for example, Friedman 1974 Kitcher 1976, 1991 (1981); Kuhn 1970; Putnam 1962;
Suppes 1967; Suppe 1977, 1989; van Fraassen 1989.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
204
This, then, allows us to make the point about the theoretical content of the
semantic view slightly differently. There certainly are laws (axioms) in the
models of the semantic view, but these are construed as constraints on the
allowable trajectories through the state space. I will return to this point in
Appendix A. Such laws are: (1) laws of coexistence (i.e., rules specifying which
states can exist simultaneously in a model; think of the constraints placed on
state-variable instantiations by the Boyle-Charles ideal gas law "PV = nRT" in a 4-
dimensional state space), (2) laws of succession (i.e., rules for determining how a
state will evolve from a previous state; think of formulas for free fall determining
changes in states, at different rates, of time, position, velocity, and acceleration,
or of transition probability matrices of Markov chains), and (3) laws of
interaction (i.e., "aggregative" ("additive") composites of laws, for cases where the
interacting systems and objects are of the same kind, such as an n-body
gravitational system, or "interactive" ("non-additive") composites of laws, for
cases where the interacting systems and objects are of different kinds – van
Fraassen here refers to the uses of perturbation theory and scattering theory; in
formal biology, interaction of different forces can be captured in a more specific
model with more variables representing the forces370).371 Certainly the laws are
derivable, and sometimes even are, part of the theory, in a deep sense. But what
is of interest is classifying and defining the set of structures, the models, that are
possibly or, when we compare the theoretical model with data models, actually,
                                                  
370 See van Fraassen 1970, p. 332 for a brief discussion of laws of interaction,
which are generally not considered in formal biology and are absent from

instantiated.372 Characterization of the models, not of the laws, is the
fundamental concern of the semantic view. As I will show in Appendix A,
however, I believe that a particular kind of law-based view of theories is
compatible, even necessarily related, to the semantic view.
Patrick Suppes' slogan summarizes the semantic view: "the correct tool for
philosophy of science is mathematics, not metamathematics" (i.e., axiomatized
sentences in first-order logic in some language L).373 Or, to state the strength of
the semantic view with respect to science rather than the philosophy of science,
van Fraassen notes regarding relativity theory (and, through the argument
presented in his book, also with respect to quantum theory) that "I want to insist
that the point of view which I have been outlining—the semantic view as opposed
to the received view [syntactic view]—is much closer to practice…."374 The
strengths of the semantic view are many. While I do not want to argue for the
absolute superiority of this view—in fact, I think that it inappropriately biases all
construals of scientific theorizing in a manner consistent with formal theoretical
                                                  
372 On model hierarchies, including the important concept of data models and
"models of the experiment," see Suppes 1962. Giere 1988a, 1988b, 1997 presents
the view that theoretical models are linked to data models through "theoretical
hypotheses." That is, theoretical models are self-consistent and are "more like
definitions than sets of empirical statements." (Giere 1988b, p. 40) Their
applicability to empirical bits of the "intended scope" of the theory is a separate
concern from their self-consistency. The latter certainly does not imply the
former. When the theoretical model fails, the question, of course, is why. Is the
failure in the assumptions about what causes and objects are involved in the
empirical system? Is the failure in assumptions about the appropriate laws,
mathematically represented? I will return to these questions, and the status of the
distinction between theoretical model applicability and theoretical model truth,
in Appendix A.

physics375 and I do not believe that theory can be defined exclusively in terms of
models, though they are central aspects of theory—I think that their focus on
models is extremely helpful.
4.2.2 Models According to the Mediating Model View
There is another interpretation of models and modeling that has become
increasingly popular over the last few years, the notion of "mediating models."376
At the heart of this interpretation is the view that (1) theoretical models are not
just a subset of theory and (2) data models are not just an organized collation of
observations:
It is common to think that models can be derived entirely from
theory or from data. However, if we look closely at the way models
are constructed we can begin to see the sources of their
independence. It is because they are neither one thing nor the other,
neither just theory nor data, but typically involve some of both (and
often additional 'outside' elements), that they can mediate between
theory and the world.377
Models are independent entities, "technologies for investigation" that are
"outside" of the hierarchy378 of data-to-theory.379 They are neither (completely)
                                                  
375 For example, in 1970, in discussing the part of natural language that was
"adapted for a technical role in the language of science," van Fraassen notes that
"this meaning structure has a representation in terms of a model (always a
mathematical structure, and must usually some mathematical space)." (van
Fraassen 1970, p. 327; see also van Fraassen 1972) While I applaud his emphasis
on models, I strongly differ with him on the point that a model always has to be a
mathematical structure. Other proponents of the semantic view, who focus on
the presentation of models in a state space (e.g., Lloyd, Thompson, and Suppe),
also emphasize the mathematical structure of modeling.
376 See, for example, Morgan and Morrison 1999a, especially the introduction by
Morgan and Morrison 1999b, the paper on "paper-tools," that is, material and
stoichiometric representations, in chemistry by Klein 1999, and the general
papers on mediating models by Suárez 1999 and Cartwright 1999b.

"derivable" from theory, in the case of theoretical models, nor (completely)
"necessitated" by data, in the case of data models.380 They have a life of their own,
a pragmatic aspect, so to speak, in that they act as instruments. This role is both
caused by, and affects, the theoretical and empirical practices of scientists.
Through constructing, manipulating, and employing models, scientists learn
new theory ("representation") and develop new experimental techniques
("intervention") for collecting data. Thus, models and modeling are the locus of
activity from which new theory and data spring.
This "mediating model" view differs from the semantic view in several
important respects. First, it does not, contra van Fraassen 1970, p. 327, hold that
models always have to be mathematical structures: "Models may be physical
objects, mathematical structures, diagrams, computer programmes, or whatever,
but they all act as a form of instrument for investigating the world, our theories,
or even other models."381 I believe that this is a strength of this view. Second, by
using examples of scientific activity, the proponents of the "mediating model"
position show that models are independent of theory and that models are
intimately tied to the activity of scientists. Morrison complains that,
the classification of theoretical models suggested by the semantic
view does not seem rich enough to capture the many ways in
which models are constructed and function. The semantic view
characterizes theoretical models as 'models of theory' – there is a
basic theoretical structure that does more than simply constrain the
acceptable models, it provides the fundamental building blocks
from which the model is constructed. …However, there is
reasonable evidence to suggest that this represents only a very
limited picture of model building in physics; many models are
constructed in a rather piecemeal way making use of different
theoretical concepts in nothing like a systematic process.382

From this we can glean some of the deeper motives guiding the mediating model
view: (1) focus on the disunity of science, and (2) concern with dynamic practice
as opposed to static representation. The emphasis on the disparate elements of,
and within, scientific (1) theory, (2) modeling, (3) experimentation, (4) data-
collection, (5) field activity, and (6) instrumentation have become increasingly
popular in the last decade.383 Furthermore, the notion that philosophers of
science should study scientific practice, including the theoretical practice of
modeling, instead of obsessing with scientific representation, including the static
structure of theories, goes back at least 20 years.384
Before I turn to discussing disunity and practice, I need to introduce two
distinctions. Theoretical aspects of science are often associated with static
product, and empirical aspects of science are often linked with dynamic practice,
but I think that these correlations are inaccurate, and the relationships are
actually orthogonal, as indicated in Table 6. (4.1). In both this and the next chapter,
I refer to manipulation happening in either, or both, the theoretical and empirical
aspects of science. I also discuss the outcomes of such manipulations – the
"representations." Note that the outcomes can themselves be input for further
dynamic practice.
                                                  
383 See particularly Galison and Stump 1996; Cartwright 1999a.
384 See Hacking 1983 who distinguishes scientific representation from
intervention; Pickering 1994 distinguishes between "representational idiom" and
"performative idiom." He claims, rightly I think, that philosophy of science—and
even much sociology of science using text-based metaphors (e.g., Latour's
"inscription devices")—employs the representative idiom. He argues that we
should move toward a performative idiom.

Table 6. (4.1) The relationship between dynamic activity and static

model view is difficult to place in this table as it claims that modeling is
independent of both theory and concrete systems. To some extent, this view is
incoherent until it can argue successfully for where and how models reside
independently. I favor the idea that modeling is a theoretical activity even if it has
empirical aspects (e.g., empirical assumptions in it). Manipulating models
                                                  
385 The distinction between empirical and theoretical activity (practice) that I
employ is not immune to critique – see, for example, Griesemer 1990, p. 3. But I
think that Griesemer does not make the important distinction between content
and activity. Theoretical activity can certainly have, and often has, much
empirical content. Furthermore, in so far as remnant models and, say, scale
models are representations of an empirical system (fauna in nature and actual
animal parts), manipulation of them, even if material, is a theoretical activity
since we are here importing theoretical biases and guiding assumptions
regarding what these material models mean. I realize that it is counterintuitive to
argue that material manipulation (in so far as it is of material models) is
theoretical, but consider the fact that any kind of theoretical manipulation, short
of thinking, includes material manipulation (e.g., writing formulas or making
drawings on a piece of paper or blackboard). Manipulation of data and models
using computers does, however, constitute a difficult case to fit under either
empirical or theoretical manipulation. I believe that computational manipulation
is probably a genuinely new kind of scientific activity.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
210
(including material models) is a theoretical activity; manipulating the concrete
system is an empirical activity (see footnote 385).
Let me now return to the two points regarding disunity and practice,
respectively. I want to remain agnostic regarding the disunity of science in
general. As I argued in Chapter 3, I certainly hope that some areas of biology,
levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology in particular,
can be synthesized, or, to use a more philosophical term, unified.386 Such a
unification is, as argued, difficult to achieve given the deeply-entrenched
differences in kinds of theory/theorizing and empirical practices, but there are
resources to accomplish the unification. Thus, I do not want to adopt necessary
local disunity in the case study I investigate, even if there is actual disunity. It is
unclear, however, whether even advocates of the disunity view, which include
proponents of the mediating model view, believe in necessary local disunity. I
will not be concerned further with the issue of unification of scientific domains in
general, but in Chapter 5, I will address the notion of unification as an aspect of
theoretical explanation in particular domains.
With respect to the second point regarding practice, I want to note that
while I do believe that a focus on scientific empirical practice is important and
informative, my project focuses on the theoretical aspects of science, dynamical
and static alike. These aspects, of course, are not inconsistent with empirical
practice.
                                                  
386 As discussed in Chapter 3, the unification desired is not just theoretical, it is
also methodological (i.e., in terms of experiments, instrumentation, and, if we
adopt the mediating model view, modeling).

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
211
My comparison between the semantic view and the mediating model
view seems, then, to point to three differences between them: (1) the extent of
independence between model and theory, (2) the focus on scientific empirical
practice, as opposed to static aspects of theory structure, and (3) the theoretical
(dynamic and static alike) disunity of science. I think these are real differences
between extreme interpretations of the two views.
Despite these real differences, a further important point must be noted.
The semantic view certainly believes in the in principle actual elaboration by
scientists, and analytical conversion by philosophers of science, of models from
theory. But this is an ideal goal. When we actually inspect a case of semantic view
analysis, Lloyd's 1988 book, we notice that she too takes a model-centered view
and analyzes the models, to some extent, independently of the deep theory of
evolutionary biology. That is, the models have a life of their own and they differ,
for example, not just in their theoretical resources, but also in their empirical
assumptions about, for example, population structure and genetic additivity.
Furthermore, Lloyd discusses both the static aspects of theory structure and the
process of model building. Thus, the models Lloyd analyzes seem to be, as
Morrison and Morgan pointed out in note 14 above, "neither just theory nor data,
but typically involve some of both (and often additional 'outside' elements)."
Put differently, Lloyd could have shown how every (or even any) model she
analyzed could be converted, in principle, into a set of laws, elaborated from
theoretical principles, that constrained trajectories in state space. This would
seem to be the proper ("static representation" in Table 6. (4.1) above) semantic
view analysis. But she does not do this anywhere in her analysis. One can argue
that that is because it would be too cumbersome and that in analyzing the

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
212
assumptions about parametrizations and what variables are important, she is
indirectly doing a proper semantic analysis. But this is not a good argument.
Conversion into a state space is not too cumbersome – she could even have done
a point by point comparison of the laws of coexistence and succession in
different models. But, I argue, this would not have been useful. The utility of Lloyd's
analysis lies, and would lie, in her stringent and cogent comparison of different
empirical assumptions and mathematical techniques in the activity of modeling.
Furthermore, her (and Wimsatt's) important additivity definition of a unit of
selection is a conceptual resource (perhaps Morrison and Morgan's "'outside'
element") that can be assumed and applied in models of different kinds, both
under the gene selectionist and multi-level selection theoretical perspective [see
Figure 1. (3.1)]. Her analysis of assumptions (e.g., the assumption of a definition
of a unit of selection) could not be done simply by converting the models into
state-space trajectories. Conceptual analysis and assessment of the role this
assumption plays in the act of modeling must also be taken into account. Thus, I
would say that Lloyd also implicitly adopts a "model-centered" notion
emphasizing the practice of modeling and including consideration of the role
empirical aspects have in modeling.
Lloyd also seems to emphasize the disunity of biology. In fact, one aspect
of her research project is to show that different players in the units of selection
debate ask different questions about biological processes (e.g., What is the
replicator? What is the interactor? What is the beneficiary of adaption? What is
the carrier of adaptation?).387 This implies a commitment, on her part, to the idea
of fundamental disunity in research projects analyzing units of selection. Thus, if
                                                  
387 See especially Lloyd 2000a.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
213
we were to form an axis388, Lloyd falls somewhere in between a "proper" (not
meant in a normative sense389) semantic view analysis, focusing on a purely
mathematical theory structure with an implicit nod toward a unified and neat
hierarchy of models, and a pure mediating model view, emphasizing the activity
of theory construction through modeling and including a commitment to a
patchy relationship between models. I think that this intermediary location is a
good place to be, and I hope (and believe) that my analysis of models in
compositional biology falls in a similar place. There is more to modeling than
theory and there is more to theory than models and modeling.
Downes' previous analysis of modeling in science is compatible with my
generalized account, to be explored in the next section, of the role models of
various types play in scientific theorizing. Downes defends a "deflationary
semantic account" in which he rejects the traditional semantic view's account of
scientific theories as families of [mathematical!] models.390 He argues that "there
are far greater differences between models in mathematics and logic and models
in science than holders of the semantic view have been prepared to admit."391 In
part this is because isomorphism between models and data is a much more
difficult relation to define than isomorphism between models at different levels
of generality. Thus meta-mathematics cannot provide a clear account of scientific
model building. Furthermore, Downes claims that some scientific theorizing
does not involve model building, although he does not provide clear examples.
                                                  
388 Although perhaps the notion of complementarity, rather than the idea of
extremes along an axis, might be more useful.
389 In fact, a "proper" semantic view would be without much use for Lloyd's
purposes.
390 Downes 1992, p. 142.
391 Downes 1992, p. 144.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
214
In short, Downes argues, although the meta-mathematical strong relationship
between theory and model is of limited use in understanding scientific model
construction (models as independent from theory), and although theorizing does
not always involve modeling (theory as independent from models), "model
construction is an important part of scientific theorizing."392 By focusing on
multiple types of models and by allowing for the independence of models and
theories, Downes provides a deflationary semantic account compatible with the
generalized model account to which I will now turn.
4.2.3 Four General Properties of Models
The model-centered analysis of both the semantic view and the mediating
model view provides a useful framework for my project. Models have been and
should be an important locus of investigation for the philosophy of science.393
One of the important differences between formal and compositional biology is
precisely the model-types that they employ. I have argued that compositional
biology uses primarily a variety of non-mathematical models, such as scale,
remnant, diagrammatic, and narrative models. But I have not yet described what
these models actually are. In this section I want to finish setting the general stage
before I turn to an analysis of the models employed in compositional biology.
This stage setting will consist in articulating four general properties any model
(not just mathematical models) must have.
(1) A model is an abstract meaning structure, of various types and at various
levels of abstraction, of objects or processes in the world. Thompson 1988 describes
                                                  
392 Downes 1992, p. 151.
393 As Downes 1992; Griesemer 1990, 1991a have also argued.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
215
van Fraassen's semantic view as one in which models are "meaning structures."394
I find this to be a useful articulation. Models are abstract representations
containing kinds of properties and objects that have particular kinds of relations
between them. These can be abstract parameters and variables expressed in
different mathematical functions, or they can be material objects with
components (e.g., scale or chemical models) standing in particular relations to
one another and which, as a whole, represent a set of concrete systems, or they
can be diagrams with kinds of parts that, also, represent a concrete system. All of
these are meaning structures. Meaning structures can exist at various levels of
abstraction – for example a mathematical model of gene frequency change with
many parameters or a diagram representing many kinds of components are more
concrete meaning structures than, respectively, a mathematical model with few
parameters or a diagram indexing few kinds of components.
(2) Models can be articulated, or "hooked up" with other models, subject to the
background protocols and assumptions of the pertinent theoretical perspective. The
abstraction relations, rather than the articulation or "aggregation" relations, of
models have been emphasized in philosophy of science. Although specifying the
abstract-concrete relation between models is crucial, it is also important to study
the way models are aggregated and partitioned. For example, how are neutral
models and selective models of evolution combined? Or, how are physiological
and developmental narrative models of a kind of organism merged? Particularly
in compositional biology, where different kinds of parts are studied from
different perspectives, this becomes an important question.
                                                  
394 Thompson 1988, Chapter 4; van Fraassen uses the term on, for example, p. 327
of his 1970.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
216
(3) Because of their independence as well as their mediating role between
theory and concrete system, models enter into a series of trade-offs. Richard Levins
first articulated a set of three desiderata that any given model cannot maximize
simultaneously: realism, generality, and precision.395 The literature on this topic
is significant and I do not want to enter into it here.396 However, one central
trade-off that I will explore is the relation between the desiderata of generality
and realism (sensu applicability to particular situations). Amount of abstraction
(the impetus to generalize) in modeling trades-off with complete model applicability
to, or full explanation of, a concrete set of circumstances.
This is precisely the point that Cartwright made by arguing that truth (i.e.,
empirical adequacy) and theoretical explanatory power trade off one another:
general laws do not have much explanatory power for particular circumstances
in which a host of other factors besides the few causes described by the general
laws play a role. 397 In her account of scientific activity, Cartwright also presents a
model-centered (as opposed to law-centered) approach: "To explain [causally] a
phenomenon is to find a model that fits it into the basic framework of the theory
and that thus allows us to derive analogues for the messy and complicated
phenomenological laws which are true of it."398 Cartwright further argues that
the models serve a variety of purposes and that different models emphasize
different (sets of) "realistic" factors. Thus, there is no all-around best model. In so
far as a model accounts for an increasing number of factors, and interactions
                                                  
395 Levins 1966, 1968.
396 But see Weisberg 2003. Weisberg makes the point that the fundamental
argument Levins made was not so much that there was a trade-off between these
three particular desiderata, but rather that there always would be trade-offs
between any desiderata.
397 See Cartwright 1983. See also footnote 480 in Chapter 5.
398 Cartwright 1983, p. 152.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
217
between them, it will be a more realistic and applicable model, but a less general
model. In so far as a model accounts for the "additive" (sensu averaged) effect of a
single (or few) factor(s), it is general, but not causally explanatory of concrete
situations. The intended scope of Cartwright's account is definitely physics for
which "the mathematical framework" is essential to theory.399 But her articulation
of the fundamental trade off between abstraction and (explanatory) concreteness
pertains to all models types.
An interesting disagreement between Cartwright and Friedman, pertinent
to my argument, appears. I shall explore Friedman's concerns regarding
explanation and unification in Chapter 5, but one way to state his views simply is
to say that for him (and Kitcher) generality ("true" laws and models) and
explanatory power are deeply and inseparably connected. Generality is necessary
for explanation in that the former decreases cognitive burden and provides
explanatory strength. They thus do not trade off one another. The reason for this
difference is, at least in part, that for Cartwright explanation is about
explanations of concrete phenomena and material causation (i.e., causal
explanation) whereas for Friedman explanation is about explanation of laws and
theories (i.e., theoretical explanation). Friedman is not concerned with
"mechanisms" and material causation. Furthermore, he holds a "neat abstract
hierarchy" view of theoretical structure, reminiscent of Suppes'. Interestingly, he
also holds that a set of increasingly abstract laws (and models) can be
confirmed.400 While unifiability and subsumption are directly related to
                                                  
399 Cartwright 1983, p. 152.
400 For example: "For a theoretical structure that plays a role in theoretical
explanations in many diverse areas picks up confirmation from all these areas."
(Friedman 1981, p. 7)

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
218
explanation in an approach focusing on explaining laws or models, as we will see
in Chapter 5, it seems to be the case that such a relation is, in fact, an ideal rarely
reached in science, even when the focus is on theoretical explanation.401
Furthermore, because Cartwright analyzes the complexities of (1) practice
(e.g., by looking at lasers) and (2) causal explanation in physics, she espouses a
concretivist trade-off account between unification/generality and explanation.
When investigating biology, even mathematical evolutionary genetics,
mechanisms, and therefore causal explanation, also come into the picture.402 In
the case of biology, then, the concretivist analysis of desiderata trade-offs, rather
than Friedman's abstractivist law or model subsumption account, comes into the
foreground. Thus, my emphasis here will be on Cartwright's trade-off, rather than
Friedman's complementarity, relationship between generality and (theoretical or
causal) explanatory power in scientific modeling.403
(4) Models are used in a variety of scientific activities, including guiding further
modeling and empirical activity, as well as providing explanations. An abstract model
can be used for various scientific activities, such as describing, explaining, or
increasing our understanding and control of the empirical world. A model need
not do all these activities to count as a model. By acting as "needle-eyes" of the
empirical world through which relatively few kinds of properties, specified by a
                                                  
401 Friedman pers. comm., July 9, 2003.
402 Some, such as Morrison 2000, make the same argument for much of physics.
Here there seems to be a disagreement about whether physics is a theoretical and
formal enterprise or, instead, a search for explanations of mechanisms. I do not
here seek to engage in this debate. However, the debate will resurface when
dealing with the explanatory status of mathematical evolutionary genetics in
Chapter 5.
403 Though in some cases, such as the Price equation of mathematical
evolutionary genetics, Friedman's account is a valid and pertinent interpretation,
as we shall see in Chapter 5.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
219
theoretical perspective, pass and by being depaupered and constructed
representations of nature, they can serve to expand our knowledge of nature in
that they provide suggestions for experiments, observations, and measurements
as well as for new kinds (or more specific) models. Thus, they are in the almost
paradoxical state of being impoverished tools for a rich expansion of scientific
knowledge. However, their power seems to lie precisely in that they only focus
on a few salient features that direct creative manipulation in theory and in
concrete systems. In their abstracted state they guide us to unexpected theoretical
connections and new empirical observations.
These four general properties of models hold for the mathematical models
of formal biology. As I will now show, these properties also apply to the models
of compositional biology.
4.3 Five Case Studies of Models in Compositional Biology
In what follows, I will present five case studies of models in compositional
biology. For each model, I show how it matches the general properties of
models.404 I start with a material model, Griesemer's notion of remnant models in
natural history. It is unclear whether natural history is a compositional biology –
but I do think that community ecology and systematics (with the Ghiselin-Hull
                                                  
404 The sole exception to this is my discussion of E.J. Corey's "retrosynthetic
analysis," which I discuss primarily as a way to undercut any claim that
modeling in compositional biology is never abstract and that models are never
manipulated independently of empirical activity.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
220
concept of the species as an individual405) can be interpreted as investigating
organisms as parts of species and species as parts of communities or clades.
However, not much rests on this unsubstantiated claim. Here I want primarily to
point out that models can be material (consider also scale models in functional
morphology) and that bona fide compositional biological sciences such as
comparative anatomy and functional morphology certainly use remnant models
(e.g., vertebrate fossil skeletons) in their work.
I then follow with two particular models, one from functional morphology
(tetrapod feeding) and one from developmental biology (genomic regulatory
systems), that are themselves expressed through different model types. This leads
me, in concluding this chapter, to note another aspect of complexity in my
argument: the variety of levels of abstraction in meaning structures. Thus, there
are at least two issues at hand regarding models in compositional biology: (1)
classifying different model-types (or, "meaning structure type") and (2)
distinguishing the level of generality of presentation of the meaning structure.
The last two models that I analyze are from biochemistry. The first (the
Krebs cycle) is an actual model (with little actual concrete variation of its various
components), whereas the second (the method of "Retrosynthetic Analysis") is a
modeling technique involving significant amounts of abstract theoretical model
manipulation. This is meant to contrast with a number of the other models of
compositional biology, where there is a constant interplay between empirical and
theoretical activity. I chose to discuss these two models because I believe that it is
important to explore a variety of cases of compositional biology. Biochemistry is
an important compositional biology, and models and modeling play an
                                                  
405 See Ghiselin 1974, 1997; Hull 1975, 1988.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
221
important role in it. Discussing chemical models brings up the important point of
how chemical "theory," and manipulation with chemical material or
diagrammatic models, differs from mathematical "theory," and manipulation with
mathematical models.406 
The model-types pertinent to compositional biology all represent parts of a
system with particular capacities – these models thus serve a crucial role in the
activity of causal explanation. Thus, there is a crucial conceptual relationship
between models, modeling, causal capacities of concrete parts, and explanation
in compositional biology. I explore this relationship in both this and the
subsequent chapter.
4.3.1 Natural History: Remnant Models
In discussing "remnant models", Griesemer shows how the specimens in a
museum, though material, actually serve theoretical roles. First of all, these
models share multiple properties with the things they model since "they are
actually made from the very individuals modeled."407 Of course, though, they are
not the object (e.g., populations or species) in toto since they are only a
representative sample of the individuals in nature. They refer to natural objects
at multiple levels of the compositional hierarchy:
[animal and plant remains preserved in museums] are physical
objects, which, for specific scientific purposes, are taken to
represent the whole, living individuals of which they were once
part. As such, specimens are remnant models of their wholes.
Remnants can provide the means for indirectly referring;
naturalists sometimes intend talk about specimens in a museum,
for example, to be indirect talk about other organisms or other
                                                  
406 I thank Sander Gliboff for helping me to see the importance of this
comparison.
407 Griesemer 1990, p. 8.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
222
more inclusive entities, such as biological species or ecological
communities in nature.408
As Griesemer shows, these objects can be used for a variety of theoretical
activities, such as reconstructing the evolution of different species (in different
niches of an area) as a consequence of environmental factors such as temperature
and humidity. The remnant models can also be used for determining the
ecological relationships between different species (of complementary ecological
classes). Thus they are both models in themselves and also serve as the material
for constructing further theoretical models about general patterns and processes
of the wholes that they represent.409 Despite their materiality, they play an
important role in theory construction and in directing—mediating—further
laboratory and field activities. They are also meaning structures in the sense that
they serve as indices of the fauna in nature, and represent ecological relations
between different species, without themselves being that fauna. Representing
ecological relations is an example of model aggregation.
In terms of trade-offs between, for example, generality and realistic
applicability, a remnant model can itself be thought of as a "generalization" since
it is an index of objects (species) in nature. Another way in which remnant
models could be considered generalizations is that they could represent
particularly important representative species for a particular ecological type (e.g.,
remnant models of a species of bat and a species of hawk as representatives of
flying predators). As fewer and fewer remnant models of fewer and fewer
species are chosen to represent such ecological types, these remnant models
could be thought of as becoming more general in that they stand in for many

other remnant models of other species. Of course, they are distinct from these
other remnant models in many respects and do not realistically match them –
hence the trade-off between generality and realism.
The modeling and empirical activities of remnant models is found
primarily in the museum practices. The practices of collecting, labeling, storing,
measuring and drawing (and otherwise representing), and sharing remnant
models determine how the models are manipulated and further represented. The
materiality of remnant models is a strength: "They are robust to some changes of
theoretical perspectives because they are literally embodiments of phenomena. If
these embodiments are preserved, they may be studied again and again under
different [theoretical] perspectives."410 Manipulation activities are, to a large
extent, independent of theory and theoretical perspective.
4.3.2 Functional Morphology: Tetrapod Feeding
I now turn to a case study of a functional morphological general model of
the tetrapod feeding cycle, represented with various diagrammatic and narrative
models. Bramble and Wake present what they refer to as a "model generalized
feeding cycle." They note that "the feeding cycles of such phyletically diverse
groups as mammals, reptiles, and amphibians appear to incorporate very similar
trains of stereotyped kinematic and motor events, involving homologous sets of
muscles…"411 From this commonality of feeding cycles among such disparate
vertebrate taxa, they suggest that the whole feeding cycle was actually present in
the ancestor and, therefore, a general model "defining the properties of this

evolutionary processes that have led to the array of feeding mechanisms
observed among tetrapods, living and extinct."412 They equate the general pattern
with the ancestral pattern – this is reminiscent of 19th century equivalences
between archetypes and ancestors. At any rate, the goal of this model was to
provide a general meaning structure for generating predictions of feeding
behaviors in various unobserved taxa as well as noting deviations from the pattern
in observed taxa. Various ecological and morphological hypotheses concerning
causes of stability and deviation from the general/ancestral pattern could then be
generated. Although the model was generated from careful observation, it was
meant to guide both hypothesis development and experimentation and
observation to test such hypotheses. This model was intended to itself be a case
of a "deductively-based morphology" that was predictively and explanatorily
powerful.413
In their model, Bramble and Wake partition the motions of the feeding
cycle. These stages become kinds of processual components of the meaning structure.
They divide the opening and closing of the mouth into five stages: slow open I
(SO-I), slow open II (SO-II), fast open (FO), fast close (FC), and slow close-power
stroke (SC-PS). The first three stages represent what the generalized/ancestral
vertebrate does as is it opens its mouth in a sequence and stops briefly at two
points before reaching maximum gape breadth (Appendix Figures 4.1, 4.2). Most
of the extension of the tongue occurs during the SO-II stage. Once the food item
has been secured with the tongue, it is brought rapidly back while the mouth is

closing in the FC stage. But the mouth does not completely close until the tongue
has been brought completely back. Once this has occurred, the SC-PS stage
occurs. Involved in this stage is the initial crushing of the food item (power
stroke).
In tandem with measurements of movements of various parts of the head
anatomy, the feeding cycle can be represented as movements of various muscle
groups (Appendix Figure 4.3) and as predicted neuronal activation patterns of
various muscle groups (Appendix Figure 4.2; note that these predicted patterns
have not to date been robustly confirmed414). The diagrammatic and narrative
models that Bramble and Wake present express the general model of the feeding
cycle.
Let us now explore the ways in which this fairly abstract meaning
structure meets the general properties of models. First of all, it is clear that this
model was used for predictions of behaviors and part capacities in all sorts of
taxa. In fact, the model served as a way to focus attention on a particular
functional morphological process; a mini-research program ensued from
Bramble and Wake's suggestive model.415 Their theoretical representation of
tetrapod feeding was a convenient and powerful starting point for a whole series
of investigations. These investigations continue to use the same partitioning (into
temporal, structural, and processual units, as described in Chapter 2) of feeding
that Bramble and Wake had suggested.
Often models are considered to be idealizations from empirical systems.
They are meant to capture as many empirical systems as possible. That is, the

and evolution in tetrapod vertebrates.

226
worth of a model stems from the breadth and accuracy with which it describes
empirical systems (given the myriad assumptions of the model). One problem is
that often models make false assumptions for purposes of simplicity and
tractability and, in those cases, they may not match many, or even any, empirical
systems very well. The idealized pendulum is one such example. Giere has an
interesting take on this case. He argues that such models should be considered
definitions that can either match or not match empirical systems. When they do
not match the system, they are not false, they are simply inapplicable to that
system.416 Models are thus postulations rather than idealizations. Others, of course,
take false assumptions at face value and then claim that the model is false (e.g.,
Cartwright, Levins, and Wimsatt). In Chapter 5, I will defend this latter view.
Now, Bramble and Wake's model plays the same sort of role as the
idealized pendulum. In both cases an abstract model is presented/postulated
that makes a large number of simplifying assumptions such that they strictly
match some, but certainly not all, cases. For the cases in which they do not match
the real system, reasons for the mismatch can be explored (e.g., ecological
conditions in ant and termite-eating mammals are such that, for example, tongue
and hyobranchial movement are almost completely decoupled417 – the fourth
column of Appendix Figure 4.1 is such that the two are coupled). This can then
give us impetus for a more general model from which certain assumptions are
simply missing418 or, for a family of more specific models each using different
                                                  
416 Giere 1988.

418 There is an important difference between making simplifying assumptions
and making no assumptions about a particular state of the system. This
corresponds to Cartwright's 1989 distinction between idealization and
abstraction made in Chapter 5 of that book. I do not have the space here to

227
(potentially overlapping) sets of veridical empirical assumptions to match
different taxa. The crucial point here is that Bramble and Wake's model is a
postulated abstract representation that can be verified/shown to be applicable
for particular cases. Despite the fact that the model fails to match some cases, it
still serves as an excellent organizing resource for research.
Thus, Bramble and Wake model is a postulation of a general feeding cycle,
abstracted from observations. It is hypothesized that this model describes the
behavior of the ancestor of tetrapods. There is some ambiguity as to how general
the model is. In a sense it is very specific in that the curves for each of the five
head parts measured have specific values, hence they represent very specific
locations during each part of the cycle. A more general model would be one in
which there was a spread of possible curves for each of the lines or one in which
there was a spread of timing for each of the five stages (e.g., SO-I could be
broader or narrower than it is), or both. The more specific the curves, and the
tighter the stage-definition is, the more concrete the model is. A more concrete
model would match fewer cases than the potential breadth of matching of a more
general model. Bramble and Wake are unclear about exactly what the level of
generality is for their model. But it is clear that the more general their model (i.e.
the less specific the lines and the more flexibility in stage definition there is), the
less it would apply to any particular case, and the less it would explain that
particular case – i.e., the less it would describe the correlations and functional
integrations between the different parts of the head and their capacities. Their
                                                                                                                                                      
further discuss this issue. With respect to assumptions, I will argue that either of
these moves makes for an increasingly general model.

model enters into the same set of trade-offs between generality and (causal, not
theoretical) explanation that occurs in physics as described by Cartwright.
Furthermore, this model also has rules of both theoretical and empirical
manipulation. Certain muscle groups (Appendix Figure 4.2) can only be
operative during particular stages of the feeding cycle. For example, the
depressor mandibulae, which upon contraction brings the posterior end of the
mandible close to the posterior (back) end of the skull, can only open the mouth.
Hence, this part of the muscular system is active during the three stages of gape
opening. Self-consistent predictions of muscle activity are based on assumptions
regarding constraints of movement. Furthermore, recall the discussion above
concerning potential levels of generality in this model by leaving the exact values
of the lines unspecified. Even when the lines are unspecified, the relationships
between the lines are constrained (e.g., gape cannot be open with mandible up).
Thus, constraints on the consistent manipulation of the model exist. The sum
total of these consistent manipulations could be thought to present the total
number of allowable states of the model, which describes the total set of possible
real world systems.
These constraints are internal to the model. There are also constraints
regarding how the model can be hooked-up to other models, for example models
regarding prey-search behavior (previous to feeding) and swallowing (after
feeding). Certain kinds of behaviors are consistent with the model of feeding
(e.g., organism must face the prey head-on). Furthermore, the tongue must
eventually reach a certain set of positions during food item capture in order to be
involved in swallowing. Thus, if models were developed for these other stages of
overall feeding, they must be made to articulate ("hook-up") well with Bramble

and Wake's model, which refers to the part-structure involved in the functional
morphology of feeding.
Bramble and Wake's model matches most of the general properties of a
model. Yet the model actually does not allow for too much informative
manipulation. Much of the work comes in testing the model against target
concrete systems and seeing how often it is false and inapplicable, and
subsequently altering or tailoring it to particular situations at hand.
4.3.3 Developmental Biology: Genomic Regulatory Systems
Another example of the employment of modeling techniques of various
kinds (e.g., diagrammatic and narrative) in compositional biology is found in a
particular subfield of developmental biology, "functional genomics." Many genes
are only expressed in some spatial locations during some periods of
development. Of these, some genes are expressed continuously, both in space
and in time. Others are expressed discontinuously in space or time, or both.
What regulates the timing and placement of gene expression? Answering this
question is one of the tasks of functional genomics.
Here I will analyze the models that Eric Davidson presents regarding cis-
regulatory genetic elements.419 A cis-regulatory element is a segment of DNA
near a gene that controls the expression of that gene by serving as a binding site
for regulatory proteins involved in repressing or stimulating transcription of the
gene. Following convention, Davidson calls such regulatory proteins
"transcription factors," which is

Chapter 4

230
used… as a neutral term, denoting any protein which displays a
high specificity for a particular cis-regulatory DNA sequence, and
which performs some function that affects transcriptional output.
Transcription factors execute a variety of functions, e.g., repression,
activation, transduction of external signaling, or architectural
alteration of cis-regulatory complexes, and they mediate diverse cis-
regulatory logic functions. For example, a commonly observed cis-
regulatory format is one in which two different transcription
factors responding to two different inputs, perhaps an intercellular
signal and a lineage marker, must both be bound in order for there
to be any output ("and" logic).420
A number of different cis-regulatory elements are involved in regulating the
expression of any gene. All these elements need to be configured in the correct
way (e.g., presence of activation proteins, absence of repression proteins, and
appropriate three-dimensional architectural structure of the DNA) if gene
expression is to occur. This is a very intricate and piecemeal process, which
allows for fine-tuned control of state of gene activation and amount of gene
transcript produced.421
Davidson emphasizes that these elements tend to be organized in groups,
or modules, which, as a unit, activate or repress a gene in the vicinity of the
module. These (genetic regulatory element) modules sometimes contain multiple
sites for the same type of transcription factor. And modules sometimes have to
act in synchrony to activate some kinds of genes. Davidson operationally defines
a module as
a fragment of cis-regulatory DNA that, when linked to a reporter
gene422 and transferred into an appropriate cell, executes a

422 Which allows for identification that the transform ("transplantation," to use a
vernacular metaphor) of the entire gene complex (reporter + whatever else the
reporter is attached to, in this case the cis-regulatory module) into a particular
cell type has occurred successfully – i.e., it "reports" success by making an
independent protein-type, such as B-galactosidase. (cf. Alberts et al. 1994, p. 424)

231
regulatory function that is a subfraction of the overall combined
regulatory function executed by the complete system.423
As mentioned above, often the same gene is expressed at different times or at
different locations, or both. For a particular time and place, only a sub-set of the
complete regulatory system for that gene (i.e., only some of the modules) is
required for gene expression. One reason that there is a mix and match of
modules for the same gene is that each module responds to the molecular
environment present in that time and place; and for different times and places,
there will be, for example, different co-factors and different products of inter-
cellular signal transduction events. The same module could not respond to these
differences. Hence a gene that has to be expressed at different times and places
must be regulated by more than one module.
Now that I have discussed some of the basic details of gene regulation, let
me turn to some models that Davidson presents to make his argument. As the
most general meaning structure of the regulatory activity of these modules,
Davidson presents a "cartoon" of two modules each affected by four kinds of
input, "spatial repressors," "signals from adjacent cells," "cell cycle control," and
"lineage."424 The first kind of input serves the role of inhibiting the module from
stimulating gene expression when found in a cell in particular spatial domains.
Most genes are turned off in most places of a developing organism most of the
time, so this is an important kind of input. The second input kind concerns
transduced molecular signals from adjacent cells (e.g., "signal transduction
pathways") that indicate to the module what its state (and if "on," what quantity)
of activation it is in (it must produce). The third and fourth input kind could be

considered "intrinsic state" recognizers/determiners. That is, the right types of
molecules must be present in the cell, contingent on time in the cell-cycle425 and
cell-type (i.e., lineage), to activate the given module. Note that this "cartoon"
model is extremely general and does not even specify (1) the relationships, in
type and in connectivity, between the molecules of these different kinds of
inputs, (2) the nature of the functional architecture of each module, or (3) the
relationships among the modules. The cartoon meaning structure is general, i.e.,
depicts few relations in the meaning structure, and does not explain any
particular case. However, it certainly can serve as inspiration for knowing which
kinds of objects and processes to look for in a cis-regulatory network. It can aid in
guiding research and is, thereby, a mediating model.
Let us now turn to a much more concrete instance of this general model, a
series of models for the "cis-Regulatory logic in the endo16 gene" of the sea urchin
Strongylocentrotus.426 In figure B, Davidson lays out the different modules in their
linear order and depicts the transcription factors that bind (as absolute or
continuous repressors or stimulators) to the different sites of each module. He
does not depict the function of each transcription factor, but he does state what
the function of each module is. Recall the more general model now under
analysis. The input kinds depicted there inform our understanding of the more
concrete model. (1) Modules DC, E, and F respond to spatial repressors and
serve that very function (they repress gene activity in certain spatial domains).
(2) Modules A and B respond to the latter three kinds of input signals of the
                                                  
425 I.e., between mitosis events, cells go through different types of phases, and
gene expression only happens in some of those phases.

more general model. Thus, there is an abstract-concrete relation between the two
models. The concrete model pertains to a specific taxon, whereas the general
model pertains to any (and thereby, no!) taxon. Note also that there are clear
rules of model hook-up in the concrete model – we simply denote more modules
and, if we choose to include more genes, we depict their regulatory modules.
In figure C, Davidson depicts a very interesting model(-type) that he has
developed with some co-workers.427 The model represents the activity of the two
regulatory modules (A and B) involved in the actual expression of the endo16
gene in terms of a logic or circuit diagram. Let me try to explain the model in a
pithy fashion – the interested reader can consult Davidson's rather lengthy figure
caption for further information (see Appendix Figure 4.7). The boxes represent
the cis-regulatory elements, the lines represent different kinds of output (Boolean
as well as continuous time-variant or time-invariant) that produce different
intermediary "states" in the circuit. From this wiring a logic-chart can be
produced which assigns intermediary values, contingent on which sites actually
have their transcription factors present, which when totaled (in i12) depict
(relative) endo16 gene amount expressed. Note that some sites, when they have
transcription factors present, actually act as inhibitors [for example R + UI + CG1
+ P, which gives (i5)] and then that state, if active, provides an intermediary
value of 0. According to the diagrammatic circuit model and the logic chart, if Z
and DC, E, and F are present in the correct ways, giving a value of 1 for (i9), all
previous activity is cancelled out. But CG2, CG3, and CG4 will, if all present, still
produce some gene product. Note that this model does not depict the actual
mechanisms among transcription factors, but rather depicts the net quantitative
                                                  
427 See, for example, Yuh et al. 1998.

234
relative effect that presence or absence of any transcription factor has on the
overall production of endo16 gene.428 As Davidson points out, "Each function was
established by measurement of the output of the system after mutating one or
more target sites, or substituting synthetic target sites for the natural
sequence."429
It is difficult to say what the nature of these models are. figure B of
Appendix Figure 4.5 is a diagrammatic model. But what is figure C of Appendix
Figure 4.6? The first diagram, representing the network is a diagram. But it is a
logic diagram, not a mechanism diagram (see footnote 428). So it is not actually
representing actual concrete activity, but is portraying logical consequences of
removing elements of a concrete system. This is a new kind of diagram, which,
admittedly, is useful for summarizing the outcomes of interactions among
different kinds of parts. It is a useful mediating model for compositional biology.
The logic chart in figure C could be seen as short-hand for a narrative model of
the logical dependencies between different intermediary states of the overall
regulatory system. Writing out the logic chart in fleshed out English would
provide a cumbersome narrative model of the overall logical story (although it
would not provide the mechanistic story!).
                                                  
428 It is unclear what the relationship between mechanism and logical networking
is. Does contiguity of logical relationship (a single arrow) imply contiguity of
interaction between transcription factors? Does the direction of the arrow (which
makes perfect sense in logic) make sense in chemical interactions, which are
interactional (molecules A and B have effects on one another)? And what does
the overall directionality indicated here represent in terms of mechanisms?
Transcription factors are binding and interacting with one another, but they are
not actually making products – that is, the various in's do not represent actual
intermediary products, but rather represent intermediary logically-useful
"quantitative states," which often refer to previous quantitative states.
429 Davidson 2001, p. 61.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
235
Certainly, however, the logical model has predictive power: "The
statements afford testable predictions of the output for any given mutation or
alteration of the system."430 That is, if a site is mutated and it cannot bind its
transcription factor any more that would, in many cases, be equivalent to an
"else" reading. The model can then be checked by systematically mutating
different regulatory regions (at different nucleotides, if one desires) and seeing if
the effect is what one expects given the previously inferred "else" readings – the
model is certainly generative of many new experiments. It would be interesting
to further consider the difference between a mechanistic model (such as Bramble
and Wake's or even Davidson's figure B) and Davidson's logical model of a
mechanistic system.
4.3.4 Biochemistry: Krebs Cycle and Corey's "Retrosynthetic Analysis"
A model that is not currently guiding research and that is also not, strictly
speaking, manipulable, is a diagrammatic representation of the Krebs cycle.431
                                                  
430 Davidson 2001, p. 60: Appendix Figure 4.7.
431 Though it was manipulable in the past (i.e., one could imagine discoverers of
the process abstractly considering different types of intermediaries and reactions
occurring for each particular step of the reaction). There is a historical question
here as to the role of models, such as scale models of molecules and
diagrammatic sketches/models as technologies of investigation during the
process of discovery of the Krebs cycle. A good place to start such an
investigation is in Frederick Holmes' (current) two-volume biography of Hans
Krebs (Holmes 1991, 1993). Although I suspect that such models (together with
experiment) played a role in the discovery of the Krebs cycle [e.g., Krebs writes
that in the early stages of the characterization of the cycle, "we tested [for] a large
number of other substances which paper chemistry suggested as intermediates."
(Krebs 170, p. 155) Krebs' historical paper is full of diagrammatic chemical
models describing what was known at different stages of the discovery process],
this is not the place to engage in historical research. There is an important point
here, though: models of all types (including mathematical models) can serve an
important role in scientific discovery. Once knowledge has been established (as
happened in the past with the Krebs cycle or even with predator-prey

Chapter 4

236
Here knowledge has become "fixed"; the model is an accurate representation of a
set of crucial reactions occurring in the matrix (central part) of the mitochondria.
This model, in its full detail would indicate the full structure of the organic
substrate intermediaries (e.g., isocitrate, succinate, fumarate, etc.), input (e.g.,
water) and output (e.g., carbon dioxide and electron carriers such as NADH and
FADH2) molecules, and, for purposes of explanation, to be discussed below, at
least the active site, if not the full conformation, of the catalyzing enzymes for
each of the 9 reaction steps of the cycle. Such a diagrammatic and narrative
model would fully represent all the activity.
Now, different levels of generality of the meaning structure of the Krebs
cycle model could be considered here. For example, all enzymatic structures
could be left out of the diagrammatic model as is, in fact, often done.432
Furthermore, the structural formula of the various substrates could be left out
and only the molecule names, or even the molecule types (indexed by numbers of
carbons)433 indicated. The exact steps in which input and output molecules are
involved could also be left out and, if at all, merely indicated in a table showing
total numbers of input and output types of molecules. The most general meaning
structure of the Krebs cycle might be written as:
                                                                                                                                                      
mathematical models), the models become a representation of knowledge itself
rather than tools for further discovery. This is not strictly true in cases where
reality is complex (as it often is) and the assumptions of the model are only
partly or locally correct. In such cases, the models can serve as investigative tools
for a further, more nuanced, investigation into complex "reality." Furthermore,
models also serve as investigative resources when knowledge has not yet been
"fixed," that is, when the relations between variables or parts of the model have
not been fully established. On the role of models in chemistry see also Klein 1999
who discusses the role that symbols for chemical compounds played for
stoichiometric and mechanistic purposes in early organic chemistry.

[4.1]
Assumptions in this very general model include that (1) "‡" indicates that one
substrate is transformed to another by a catalytic enzyme and (2) the term
"substrate" instead of "product" is used after the arrow because the product is a
substrate for a specific and explicitly known subsequent reaction. Such a general
model is very distant indeed from the empirical content of the actual activity,
and would be a model for any circular 9-step reaction series. Note, then, the
trade-off in generality and empirical adequacy/causal explanatory power here.
This trade-off points to how explanations are produced through
diagrammatic models in biochemistry, a compositional biology. It is through the
presentation of (1) the part articulation of the substrate molecules, with their
various functional groups, (2) the part articulation of the reactive enzymes,
together with an understanding of (3) the various rules of interaction (including
"attacks" and "removals" of electrons, bonds, and, therefore, of functional groups)
that explanations of the various reactions (9 types in the Krebs cycle) are
produced.
Consider Stryer's narrative model of the formation of L-malate from
fumarate (Appendix Figure 4.8; step 8 in Appendix Figure 4.10):
The next step in the cycle is the hydration of fumarate to form L-
Malate. Fumarase catalyzes a stereospecific trans addition of H and OH,
as shown by deuterium-labeling studies. The OH group adds to only
one side of the double bond of fumarate; hence, only the L-isomer of
malate is formed.434

238
Note that his explanation is in terms of movement of particular groups (e.g.,
hydrogen and hydroxide) into specific parts of the molecule. He does not detail
the actual mechanism of this in terms of the active sites and energetics of
fumarase, which could also be done; but he does describe an experiment
(deuterium labeling) that allowed for determination of the exact method of
substrate transformation. He complements his explanation with a diagram
showing the two molecules.435
This explanation is an example of capacity talk that refers to parts of a
system436. The fumarase enzyme has the capacity to convert one molecule into
another through hydrolysis and precise placement of H and OH groups. This is a
Cummins' function (see Chapter 5) in that an overall system behavior (i.e., Krebs
cycle and its production of electron carriers which later relinquish their electrons
for the production of ATP in the reactions of oxidative phosphorylation, also
known as the electron transport chain) is explained in terms of compositional
capacities of the parts (e.g., fumarase as the catalyst of fumarate to L-malate). The
basis of this explanation is provided in the diagrammatic and narrative models
representing the Krebs cycle. Note that such explanations cannot be gleaned
from a too general presentation of the model.437 Hence we see the trade-off
between generality and explanatory power of this case of diagrammatic and
narrative models.
In this meaning structure, particularly at concrete levels of generality,
there are criteria of self-consistency. For example, there are very few, often only
one, specific reactions that will convert a specific substrate into a specific

product. During the process of discovery, however, there may very well have
been various candidate (closely related) molecules and reactions considered for
each step of the cycle. Confirmation of these various contrastive models then
depended on experimental results, such as characterization of substrates
involved and the capacities of enzymes required. Eventually the discoverers
settled on a single model of the Krebs cycle, replete with criteria of self-
consistency (e.g., particular reactions require particular enzymes, input in
number and type of atoms in each reaction must equal output in number and
type of atoms).
Another property of models is that there are criteria of allowable "hook-
up" with other models. For example, consider the criteria of alternative
parameterizations for the Price equation438 and rules for relating selectionist with
neutralist models of evolution – these are criteria of model diversification439 via
abstraction relations. In the case of narrative and diagrammatic models of objects
and processes in compositional systems, the criteria for hook-up refer to literal
hook-up and do not proceed via abstraction relations. Here the expansion occurs
through explicit addition of models of other reactions and reaction series that
complement the focal model. For example, a model of the biosynthesis of
cholesterol can be added to a model of the Krebs cycle in that they both have
acetyl coenzyme A in common. This model expansion is indicated in Appendix
Figure 4.11, which also shows "diagrammatically" about 500 common and
interrelated reactions in a cell. Note that this figure can be decomposed into
reaction parts; an "articulation of parts" mechanistic explanation of the different

nodes can be provided by accounting for the previous nodes and the reaction
type connecting the two nodes. Reaction model partitioning and articulation is
clear in this diagrammatic model.
Let us turn to a different model, or, rather a modeling technique. There is
an interesting case of the uses and extent of model manipulation in biochemistry,
or rather, organic chemistry, which is, arguably a compositional science (perhaps
not quite a compositional biology). E.J. Corey, a Harvard organic chemist who
won the Nobel Prize in 1991, developed, in detail, the practice of "retrosynthetic
analysis." Before him:
most syntheses were developed by selecting an appropriate
starting material, after a trial and error search for commercially
available compounds having a structural resemblance to the target
of synthesis. Suitable reactions were then sought for elaboration of
the chosen starting material to the desired product. Synthetic
planning in most instances was strongly dependent on an assumed
starting point.440
The reigning methodology was trial and error through a series of reactions that
eventually provided the desired end product.
Corey's insight, simple as it may sound, was to start with a chemically
accurate model, either physical or diagrammatic, of the end product and, using
chemical models, subject it
to a deconstruction process which corresponds to the reverse of a
synthetic reaction, so as to convert that target structure [end product] to
simpler precursor structures, without any assumptions with regard to
starting materials. Each of the precursors so generated is then
examined in the same way, and the process is repeated [stepwise
backwards] until simple or commercially available structures are
arrived at.441

Chapter 4

241
This "deconstruction process" was not carried out in experiments, but, rather,
detailed knowledge of organic chemistry was used to infer, using physical or
diagrammatic models, how particular kinds of reactions would produce end
products from initial reagents. One "attractive" pathway at a time is "selected and
validated by experimental execution."442 (See Appendix Figure 4.12.) Of course,
computers were eventually used (starting in the late 1960s) to develop many
possible pathways and to choose the most attractive ones. Present in the
computer software is
The chemical knowledge base, written so as to be intelligible to a
practicing chemist, [and] contain[ing] all the types of information
required for generation and evaluation of retrosynthetic changes,
for example, data on individual transforms and their mechanisms,
scope, and limitations.443
Corey's methodology is a clear case of the uses and prevalence of model
manipulation directing empirical research in a field that is focused on parts.
Let me now compare chemical to mathematical theory. Chemical theory
can provide the basis for significant material model manipulability
independently of (continuous) empirical verification, either through the use of
physical chemical models or diagrammatic chemical models (as we saw in the
case of Corey's work). For both kinds of theory, we can manipulate symbols or
bits of matter in ways that are informative and highly predictive. Yet there are at
least two important differences between the two kinds of theory, the role of

443 Corey 1991, p. 458. Earlier in the paper (p. 457), Corey had listed six "major
types of strategies which are of value in retrosynthetic analysis." They include:
(1) structure-goal strategies, which focus on the structure of the reagent and
investigate whether one can get from the reagent to the product – this is the
"actual" chemical reaction direction!, and (2) functional group-based strategies,
which focus on the effects of functional group removal or interchange.

empirical generalizations and the existence of exceptions, both of which I will
now examine.
Fundamentally, chemical theory seems to be an elaborate collection of
empirical generalizations, much of which, admittedly, does have an internal
consistency, given background knowledge. There is an "internal" logic, but it has
been inferred from data. Today's chemical theory, on which we can base theoretical
manipulation, is the product of yesterday's empirical manipulation. This is very
different from the mathematical theory of, say, population genetics, where a few
axioms together with the rules of, for example, algebra, matrix algebra,
differential equations, etc. can be used to consistently model the results of the
behavior of gene frequency change under the existence of particular evolutionary
forces at particular magnitudes. Here theory is not inferred or built up
empirically, although it may (and should!) be verified empirically. To exaggerate:
chemical theory is the product of empirical manipulation, formal mathematical
theory is the product of theoretical manipulation. This gets to deep issues
surrounding the a priori, necessary, and definitional aspects of mathematics and
the relations between mathematics and science. Further exploration of these
issues would be fruitful.
Related to the issue of empirical generalizations (chemical theory) versus
"definitional" postulation (mathematical theory) is the idea of exceptions in
chemical theory. Clearly the exceptions are many, as any student just beginning
to learn chemistry (especially organic!) will complain. There are, sensu stricto, no
exceptions in mathematics. Furthermore, empirical exceptions to a mathematical
functional relationship can be attributed to lack of knowledge of all the relevant
factors (i.e., ceteris paribus condition fails). Mathematical laws and models, if

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
243
postulated consistently and correctly, cannot have empirical exceptions. They
can just fail to apply.
Thus, while chemical theory allows for very large amounts of independent
theoretical manipulation of chemical meaning structures, there seems to be a
significant difference in the empirical vs. (purely) theoretical aspects of (1)
theory, (2) models, and (3) modeling in formal and compositional biology.
Models and the theoretical activity of modeling is much more "a priori" in formal
biology and empirical/material in compositional biology, even though we
should not discount the importance of theoretical activity in discovering new
knowledge in (especially some fields of) compositional biology nor should we
ignore the theoretical content of the components of the meaning structures of
compositional biology.
4.4 On Models as Meaning Structures and Model-Based Explanation in
Compositional Biology
In Chapter 1, I noted that manipulation in compositional biology occurred
primarily in the empirical realm of the concrete systems under study, through
activities such as experimentation and observation. This I contrasted with formal
biology where manipulation occurs primarily in its mathematical models. I
believe this to be a fairly accurate depiction, within limits, of the activity that
occurs in each of the two respective kinds of biology.
But we should not take this to suggest that the two kinds of biology are,
respectively, observational and theoretical. Theoretical modeling, through the

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
244
use of remnant, scale, diagrammatic or narrative model types, is a crucial aspect
of compositional biology. Such models are used to abstractly represent the
compositional structure and process-function (capacities) of, for example,
organisms and their hierarchically-organized component parts. These models
present depictions of systems, including the structures and capacities of their
constituent parts, in order to both (1) suggest loci for further experimentation
and observation (including inter-taxa comparisons) as well as (2) make
theoretical claims, and provide causal explanations, regarding the general
characterizations of the structures and capacities of parts. Put differently,
without these models, a clear theoretical representation of the systems and
activities under study by large areas of biological science would simply not be
possible.
It might be argued by some that the models prevalent in compositional
biology are not (sufficiently) theoretical because (1) they cannot be formulated on
the basis of simple and few laws and axioms of any sort, or because (2) clear
predictions and "work" cannot arise from them simply by manipulating them
independently of the concrete systems of which they are meant to be
representations.444 With respect to the first criticism, it is clear that a number of
models in particularly mathematical ecology are also not theoretical in that sense
– simulations are not always based on simple and few laws and axioms.445 Of
course, it could be further claimed that simulations are not theoretical and do not
match the "gold-standard" form of analysis of law-like population genetics. But I
                                                  
444 Michael Weisberg, a recent PhD graduate from the Stanford Philosophy
department who wrote his dissertation on model-building in ecology, has
suggested the latter criticism to me.
445 For a philosophical analysis of simulations in biology see, for example,
Dietrich 1996.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
245
do think that a number of practitioners of formal biology would agree that
simulations count as theoretical and as acceptable model-types of formal biology.
More importantly, while it is true that the models of compositional
biology tend to not be mathematical, they are often based on some kinds of
simple and few theoretical principles. For example, Davidson and co-worker's
diagrams of genomic regulatory systems follow the conventions of flow charts,
which include drawing objects such as boxes and arrows indicating (types of)
activity. Rules of geometry, and even aesthetic rules pertinent to ease of cognitive
presentation446, also govern such depictions. Such conventions and rules are, or
could be presented, axiomatic(ally). They are certainly theoretical principles that
govern the mode of representation and that bring representational order to the
chaos of mechanistic material causality. Mathematical representations of the sort
held dear by mathematical evolutionary genetics and theoretical population
ecology are merely one form of theoretical order-imposition; multiple other
modes of enforcing order, stemming from different kinds of "axiomatic" rules, in
different media of model presentation, exist. Different theoretical perspectives,
particularly ones very different in kind, can include assumptions regarding
different modes of representation – these are theoretical assumptions guiding the
activity of model-building.
It is true that many of the models of compositional biology are not, by
themselves, subject to significant and useful independent theoretical
manipulation – a case like Corey's retrosynthetic analysis, or chemical theory
more generally, is the exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, we have seen
how chemical and mathematical theory differ. Constant referral to the concrete

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
246
system is necessary in generating most of the meaning structure types of
compositional biology. But this does not make the models less theoretical
(although, as we shall see in Chapter 5, model development, that is, theoretical
explanation, requires continuous confirmation).
The models still contain much theoretical content in that they contain
assumptions about what the models are supposed to represent and how the
background concepts are supposed to be defined. For example, any
diagrammatic model portraying the structure or development of inter-taxon
parts that are supposed to be homologous is, whether the claim is accurate or
not, an extremely theoretically-rich model. This is because the very concept of
homology is a significantly theory-laden one for which there is a large amount of
discussion and disagreement.447 A model that makes robust claims about
homology uses a stabilized and robust notion of homology (although not vice-
versa in the case for which the model is empirically inaccurate – i.e., false).
Furthermore, the model summarizes, in an abstract fashion, the shape, relations,
and capacities of the parts it portrays. This is a theoretical representation of the
system under study.
With respect to theoretical activity, some manipulation of the model is
possible independently of empirical manipulation of the concrete system448 and
this often suggests numerous places in which a scientist could further investigate
the concrete system. Models and modeling point toward new experiments that
could be performed (e.g., is there a causal relation of any sort between these two

1989, 1994, 1995, 1996; Wray 1999.
448 Recall the distinction made above in footnote 385 between (1) material models
as theoretical entities in that they represent a concrete system and (2) the
materiality of the concrete system itself.

Models and Modeling

genes for which there is no line in the model? Is there a relation of neural
activation between this and that muscle group during the process of
mastication?), and it also intimates at new ("mere") observations that could be
made (e.g., how would my model of the evolution of function of this set of parts
in related taxa look if I added these characters (of the parts) to my character
matrix?).
Thus modeling is a theoretical activity that furthers scientific knowledge.
It may be true that such activity is, in the models of compositional biology,
closely tied to, and constantly constrained by, empirical observations, but the
formalistic distinction between theory/observation statements does not and
should not map onto a more robust distinction between theoretical and empirical
activity. That is, the fact that theoretical activity relies on empirical observations
does not make the activity less theoretical, as we shall also see in Chapter 5. It is
clearly theoretical in the sense that it generalizes, organizes, represents, and
provides abstract suggestions for intervention in, concrete systems.
In this chapter, I have shown how model-types such as scale models,
remnant models, diagrams, narratives—linguistic and "logical"—are employed in
compositional biology. The point is not that these models are absent from formal
biology, but they play a prevalent and powerful role in compositional biology
precisely because they can accurately represent the compositional structure and
process-function (causal capacity) of the components, at various integrated levels
(determined by the theoretical perspective employed), of hierarchical biological
systems. They can be used to precisely depict the causal capacities of the parts of
the system, as I will also discuss in Chapter 5 (they thus serve crucial roles in
causal explanation in compositional biology).

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
248
But while mentioning these model-types, and showing how they can be
meaning structures at different levels of abstraction (e.g., tetrapod feeding and
genomic regulatory systems), I have not provided an in-depth analysis of each
model-type. I definitely think that such an analysis is important. There is some
excellent literature on remnant models (Griesemer), diagrams449, and
narratives450, independently of the context of the framework I have been
developing in this dissertation. (There seems to be scant literature on the role of
scale models.) I believe that further analysis of these kinds of models in the
context of compositional biology would be very fruitful and future work will
address the nature and role of each of these model-types in the context of
compositional biology.
These model-types (e.g., diagrams and narratives) can serve as fairly
concrete meaning structures in which to present more general meaning
structures, or frameworks, of, for example, tetrapod feeding and genomic
regulatory systems. The general meaning structure is concretized, in Bramble
and Wake's model, for example, in diagrammatic and narrative meaning
structures specifying a particular set of behaviors common to many taxa. The sets
of tetrapod behaviors are a "heuristic model that serves as a hypothesis for
testing rather than a fixed reality of feeding kinematics in tetrapods."451 Note,
though, that the general model can, and has, survived testing which showed its
inadequacy for particular taxa. It continues to guide research and is, therefore, a
mediating model that further advances theory and experiment/data.

Chapter 4
Models and Modeling
249
In this chapter I hope to have shown that a general picture of the nature
and role of models and modeling in scientific practice can be gleaned using the
semantic view and the "mediating model" view, complemented with
Cartwright's and Friedman's physics-based analysis of abstraction as well as
Griesemer's and Downes' analysis of non-standard models, as philosophical
input. The picture of models articulated by these philosophers was initially
designed for the mathematical models of physics and formal biology. But, as I
hope to have shown, the general properties that I have articulated also definitely
apply to the models prevalent in compositional biology.
I have argued that models have four general properties: (1) models are
meaning structures of various types and at various levels of abstraction, (2)
models can be "hooked up" with other models, subject to the background
protocols and assumptions of the theoretical perspectives guiding the
articulation of models, (3) models are always subject to trade-offs among
pragmatic desiderata – for example a general model is rarely a realistic one, and
(4) models are used in a variety of scientific activities, including guiding further
modeling and empirical activity, as well as providing explanations.
In the following chapter I will turn to how models serve a crucial role in
the activity of explanation. There are crucial conceptual relationships between
models, causal capacities, and explanation in both formal and compositional
biology leading to two different pictures of explanation in the two kinds of
biology.

Chapter 5: Explanation in Formal and Compositional Biology
5.1 Framing and Goals
In this dissertation, I have explored a multitude of differences between
two kinds of theorizing in biology, formal and compositional biology. In Chapter
1, I alluded to a fifth distinction between the two kinds of biology, differences in
the goals of explanation. In Chapter 3, I discussed differences in explanatory
resources between the two kinds of theoretical perspectives analyzed therein,
levels of selection theory and evolutionary developmental biology. One of these
resources is precisely the goal or aim of an explanation. In both chapters, I
mentioned that I would address this issue head on in Chapter 5. Furthermore, in
Chapter 4, I explored the general properties of models and investigated a few
case studies of meaning structures (models) that present them, in compositional
biology. Thus, there is an outstanding issue of how these models assist scientific
explanations. In this chapter, I will therefore discuss the differences in aim of
explanations in the two kinds of biology as well as the way that models
particular to each kind of biology assist in achieving these diverse aims.
In order to do this, I must place my analysis in the context of the
philosophy of science literature on explanation. I will show how explanations,
both causal and theoretical, are employed in the two kinds of biology. The
formalistic (i.e., statistical and mathematical) accounts of causal explanation

Chapter 5
Explanation
251
present in philosophy of science, such as those of Cartwright, Glymour, and
Salmon, are relevant to formal biology. Part-based versions of causal
explanations, such as those of Cummins, Kauffman, and Wimsatt are pertinent to
compositional biology. The contrast in patterns and goals of these two overall
projects regarding explanation are striking, as I will show. Furthermore, I also
want to show that theoretical explanation differs remarkably between the two
kinds of biology in that law and model articulation occurs neatly and, to a large
extent, independently of empirical activity in formal biology, whereas modeling
and empirical activity are intricately tied in compositional biology. This is also
why theoretical unification, as a form of theoretical explanation most ably
explicated by Friedman, pertains only to formal biology. Thus, the pictures,
figuratively and literally, of explanation in the two forms of biology are quite
distinct. In order to draw, conceptually and actually, these pictures, I must also
bring in considerations regarding confirmation.
We can thus get a much better handle on the methods and goals of
different accounts of explanation in the philosophy of science literature
(including the models and model-types that they favor) by comparing the two
families of accounts within my framework contrasting formal and compositional
biology. Conversely, we can, not surprisingly, understand the differences
between formal and compositional biology much better if we analyze their
adoption of different pictures of explanation. Table 7. (5.1) provides the framing
for my analysis.
In formulating my argument, I show that there is a close relationship
between the view of explanation endorsed and the model-types employed.
Models can be taken to represent formal dependencies among mathematically-

Chapter 5
Explanation
252
defined properties of simple kinds452 of objects (formal biology) or material-
mechanistic interactions among kinds of parts of a hierarchical and integrated
complex system (compositional biology). Models can also be taken to represent
the causal capacities of the objects, sometimes parts, under consideration by the
two types of biology (causal explanation) or to represent the theoretical inter-
relation among models at different levels of abstraction (theoretical explanation).
I will proceed by first motivating what an explanation even is and how one
can even distinguish causal from theoretical explanation. Of course this is a deep
question, but by analyzing van Fraassen's views on explanation, and different
interpretations of them, I will motivate my position on this. I will then continue
by analyzing formal and compositional biology, respectively, vis-à-vis their
commitments to causal and theoretical explanation. This I do by explicating some
case analyses for each area: Cartwright, Cummins, and Friedman. I also assess
Kitcher's view on theoretical unification. I could also have evaluated the views of
other philosophers on these issues, but I choose these five because I believe that
their views are clear and paradigmatic instances of the explanatory patterns that
I wish to explore.
5.2 Does Van Fraassen Have an Anti-Metaphysical Deflationary, or an Empiricist
Positive, Account of Explanation?
One influential account of scientific explanation is van Fraassen's
pragmatic version. Van Fraassen is an anti-realist who believes that science
                                                  
452 In the sense of Chapter 1.

produces "empirically adequate" theories with no metaphysical realist content
about unobservables. His view, as developed in The Scientific Image, is one he
calls "constructive empiricism" which foregoes hypotheses about "truth" and the
"real" state of the world. The following paragraph provides a pithy summary of
his view:
…[W]e can distinguish between two epistemic attitudes we can
take up toward a theory. We can assert it to be true (i.e. to have a
model which is a faithful replica, in all detail, of our world), and
call for belief; or we can simply assert its empirical adequacy,
calling for acceptance as such. In either case we stick our necks out;
empirical adequacy goes far beyond what we can know at any
given time. (All the results of measurement are not in; they will
never all be in; and in any case, we won't measure everything that
can be measured.) Nevertheless there is a difference: the assertion
of empirical adequacy is a great deal weaker than the assertion of
truth, and the restraint to acceptance delivers us from
metaphysics.453
I interpret his anti-realism to stem, at least partially, from the myriad
incompatible realist interpretations that can be and are produced of quantum
mechanical phenomena.454 In quantum mechanics, his specialty, unobservable or
theoretical entities are ubiquitous – almost, by definition, so. It is no surprise that
the study of such a field would produce an anti-realist philosopher.
                                                  
453 Van Fraassen 1980, pp. 68-69. This position mirrors the operationalist position
of Duhem in his The Aim and Structure of Physical Theories, which is both anti-
model (in the sense of mechanical material models such as those developed by
Kelvin of the aether; see Part I, Ch. 4) and anti-metaphysics (metaphysics should
be, according to Duhem, but contra Quine, clearly distinguished from science;
see Part I, Ch.1). For Duhem, the aim of science was to produce symbolic, formal
laws, which, he argued, were approximate and ceteris paribus laws (see Part II,
Ch. 5). Van Fraassen shares Duhem's anti-metaphysical stance, but emphasizes
symbolic and formal models rather than laws (recall, as I argued in the
introduction, that I do not think that the two are that different, provided we
interpret the notion of "law" correctly). Van Fraassen, like Cartwright, is highly
critical of the validity of laws of any sorts and, more so than Cartwright,
emphasizes the role of models in scientific work. At any rate, there is much in
common, albeit in different ways, between Duhem and both van Fraassen and
Cartwright.
454 See van Fraassen 1989.

Chapter 5
Explanation
254
The issue that I want to address here is the nature of van Fraassen's view
on explanation, including its relationship to his anti-realism. There are two
general interpretations of his views. The first one asserts that because of his anti-
realism, he adopts a very deflationary account of explanation, claiming that it is
not a proper part of scientific investigation or that, at best, it amounts merely to
empirical adequacy.455 The second one argues that he does have a substantive
version of explanation that is relativistic and pragmatic, and that it is simply "a
three-term relation between theory, fact, and context" as van Fraassen himself
claims.456 Commentators partial to the first interpretation, think that van Fraassen
does not give "explanatory power" sufficient importance, whereas proponents of
the second interpretation claim that he gives it the appropriate amount of
importance. I do not wish to adjudicate between the two views in so far as
determining van Fraassen's actual view; but I do want to state that I am more
sympathetic to the concerns underlying the first interpretation. Explanatory
patterns are importantly different in the two kinds of biology, and I think that
this is due to more than empirical adequacy within an explanatory context. Let us
turn to a brief analysis of the two interpretations.
For van Fraassen, explanations are the attainment of empirical adequacy
in an answer to a why-question457. A typical request at an explanation is a why-
                                                  
455 For example, see Kitcher 1991 (1981), p. 330-332; Strevens 2004 (in press). So
does Cartwright 1983, implicitly, in her arguments against van Fraassen's
criticisms of inference to the best explanation. Cartwright sees a deep link
between van Fraassen's anti-realism and his skepticism regarding this form of
explanation. What she believes about van Fraassen's general view on explanation
remains, however, indeterminate.
456 Elisabeth Lloyd clarified van Fraassen's views to me. The quote from van
Fraassen is in 1980, p. 156.
457 This is also the view of Hempel and Oppenheim in their classical and much-
critiqued essay. They wrote: "To explain the phenomena in the world of our

Chapter 5

255
question (e.g., "Why did allele X increase in frequency in the population?").
Answers to such a question are the explanation. Note that there can be different
contrast classes of answers: (1) because the allele produced functional rather than
dysfunctional hemoglobin  (a kind of "material" contrast class), or (2) because the
allele had a higher fitness than alternative alleles (a kind of "formal" contrast
class). Or, to use an example from van Fraassen, "Why did Adam eat the apple?"
is a question demanding an answer relative to three different contrast classes,
each of which defines different sets of relevant answers: (1) Adam as opposed to
somebody else, (2) eating as opposed to some other activity, (3) an apple as
opposed to another object.458 An explanation, then, is an empirically adequate
answer, within the causal framework and set of accepted contrast classes and
relevance conditions of a scientific theory, for a why-question.459
Empirical adequacy is itself determined by the "matching" (a concept
explored in more detail below) between theoretical model and data model. But
this matching occurs, importantly, within the context of the scientific theory.
Thus, explanation
is a three-term relation between theory, fact, and context…. So to
say that a given theory can be used to explain a certain fact, is
always elliptic for: there is a proposition which is a telling answer,
relative to this theory, to the request for information about certain
facts (those counted as relevant for this question) that bears on a
                                                                                                                                                      
experience, to answer the question "why?" rather than only the question "what?"
is one of the foremost objectives of all rational inquiry; and especially, scientific
research in its various branches strives to go beyond a mere description of its
subject matter by providing an explanation of the phenomena it investigates."
(1948, p. 135)
458 Van Fraassen 1980, p. 127. See also Garfinkel 1981.
459 This is also the account of scientific explanation that Lloyd adopts in her work
– see especially Lloyd 1988, 2000a. It remains a bit unclear how to relate the
notions of contrast classes and relevance relations to the state space articulation
of models.

comparison between this fact which is the case, and certain
(contextually specified) alternatives which are not the case.460
It would seem, then, that explanation is simply empirical adequacy within an
explanatory context. It is the import of this claim about which commentators
disagree.
One camp (the "deflationary" one) notes that this is a very weak view of
explanation. They remind us that, for van Fraassen, using a theory to provide an
answer does not imply that you believe that the theory is true, either in capturing
laws or in capturing causes. The following paragraph describes some of the
attitudes van Fraassen wants to distance himself from:
Once you decide that explanation is something irreducible and
special, the door is opened to elaboration by means of further
concepts pertaining thereto, all equally irreducible and special. The
premises of an explanation have to include lawlike statements; a
statement is lawlike exactly if it implies some non-trivial
counterfactual conditional statement; but it can do so only by
asserting relationships of necessity in nature. Not all classes
correspond to genuine properties; properties and propensities
figure in explanation. Not everyone [especially not van Fraassen!]
has joined this return to essentialism or neo-Aristotelian realism,
but some eminent realists [e.g., Armstrong, Dretske, Tooley,
Salmon, and, perhaps, even Cartwright] have publicly explored or
advocated it.461
The deflationary camp argues that this thoroughly anti-metaphysical account of
explanation is overly driven by worries about what sorts of information are
epistemically justified in science. Put differently, van Fraassen fights
"metaphysics" with "anti-metaphysics," that is, with an appeal to a highly
tempered epistemology. But if we move away from the particular philosophical
bout of realism-anti-realism and explore the nature of actual scientific theories,

the deflationists argue, we see that while van Fraassen's account of explanation
as context-dependent answers to why questions is certainly a component of what
scientists are doing, it also seems clear that scientific explanations are doing
much more – they seem to have independent patterns and structures that are
clearly recognizable and that provide us with particular types of claims that differ
from other types of explanatory claims produced by other (kinds of) theories.
Thus, we should judge explanations not just by their empirical adequacy, but
also by the consistency and pattern of their theoretical structure and aim (e.g., are
we explaining causes or theories?). They have "explanatory power" over and
above empirical adequacy.
Now, the second camp, which I will call the "actualists," believe that van
Fraassen does hold that explanation plays an actual and important role in
science.462 They hold that van Fraassen's view on explanation is a positive one
and that it is a sufficient view. Van Fraassen, they say, does not deny that
explanation exists, he simply holds that there is no independent virtue of
"explanatory power" over and above empirical adequacy within a theoretical and
pragmatic context. Actualists seem to claim that van Fraassen would allow for
genuine explanatory differences between contexts, but that the power, meaning,
structure, or aim of an explanation is always judged and fleshed out on the basis
of empirical adequacy and not on the basis of the intrinsic nature and goal of
either the theoretical structure, or the pattern of relation—rather than the actual
empirical adequacy of a particular instance—between the theory and the data. In
short, the actualist seems to believe that if models, laws, or statements are
                                                  
462 I take Elisabeth Lloyd to be a key "actualist." Note that my terms refer to the
nature of the interpretations of van Fraassen's views, not to the role or nature such
commentators believe scientific explanation in itself has or should have.

empirically adequate, then they could explain depending on the question. The
deflationist (vis-à-vis interpreting van Fraassen's view) claim that models, laws,
or statements have internal properties that give them explanatory structure and
goals over and above empirical adequacy and that, therefore, van Fraassen's
view on explanation is deflationary.
This is not a debate that can be further clarified, yet alone solved, here.
Perhaps van Fraassen did not say enough in his 1980 book to determine which
interpretation of him is appropriate. However, I am more sympathetic to the
views motivating the deflationist, as opposed to the actualist, interpretation of
van Fraassen. While I agree with much of van Fraassen's general framework in
which context plays a central role, I do believe that we can inspect just the
theoretical structure and aim of particular kinds of explanations to articulate what
is special and characteristic of that form of explanation. In fact, the two kinds of
biology that I am exploring, while not necessarily making claims about "reality,"
do use different kinds of explanatory patterns. That is, the different models and
model-types developed by each kind of science provide the grounds for different
forms of explanations that, although they can certainly be seen as answers to
why-questions within a context, also have more specific properties that
differentiate one explanation picture from another in important ways,
independently of the empirical adequacy of particular explanations.
Furthermore, given the prevalence of "observational entities" in biology (in
contrast to quantum mechanics), we are even less justified in biology to discard
the view that there is more to explanation than empirical adequacy within a
context.  And we do not need to adopt realism to adopt meaty views regarding
explanation – appealing to the differences in structures and goals in biological

model-based explanatory practices, as I will show in this chapter, is sufficient.
Switching metaphors, biological explanations have some metaphysical and
theoretical bite, even if the jaw that does the biting is scientific theoretical practice
rather than metaphysical realism. I will now turn to an analysis of the different
kinds of explanation in formal and compositional biology.
5.3 Distinguishing Between Causal and Theoretical Explanation
The distinction between causal and theoretical explanation, commonly
recognized by philosophers of science, is that between explaining a concrete
event such as the movement of a planet around the Sun or the catalysis of some
substrate to make a product and explaining a law or general pattern, such as
Kepler's laws or the general pattern of hierarchical organization (both of these
latter two can also be thought of as theoretical models).
With respect to explaining concrete cases, when we explain the particular
orbit of a planet, as discussed above, we appeal to subsumption of the concrete
case under some law or, more generally, the matching of some bit of a concrete
system to a theoretical model (e.g., Kepler's or, more generally, Newton's laws);
here we are showing that a concrete system is an instantiation, or, more
generally, stands in a particular relation of similarity to the theoretical assertions
produced by the law or model463.
                                                  
463 In what follows, I will repeatedly mention "law" and "model" together. As I
argue in Appendix A, the two are intimately related in formal biology. For
example, laws, properly formulated as "equations of the model," can be
considered to produce models, in the mathematical sense of the semantic view,

Chapter 5
Explanation
260
On the other hand, when we explain a particular concrete case of catalysis,
there is also a sense in which we match that particular case under a more general
model of that catalysis-type464. But this matching (subsumption) activity is not
the central aspect of explaining a chemical reaction; the crucial aspect is that we
employ compositional and functional analysis, sensu Cummins, in both the
general model and manipulation of the empirical case. That is, we explain the
reaction by referring to the dispositions of the different parts of the reactive
system.
I will explore these two importantly distinct forms of causal explanation,
pertinent respectively to the two types of biology I examine, by looking at two
particular suggestions for each of the two causal explanatory patterns,
Cartwright's and Cummins' analysis of causal capacities. These are not the only
ways of explicating causal explanation in the two forms of biology (e.g., Glymour
and Salmon for formal biology, Kauffman and Wimsatt for compositional
biology), but despite their limitations they are good candidates for
                                                                                                                                                      
that produce predictions that are then compared in degree of matching to the
empirical evidence. [Even an extreme syntactic view, which does have an
inappropriate, by my account, version of Laws, can still be interpreted as
producing a (syllogistically-driven, in this case) prediction that is then compared
to actual data –  degree of similarity between prediction and data is assessed.
Thus, the semantic view's emphasis on theoretical model <-> data model
matching is not unique to it. Both the syntactic view of theories and related
versions of it, honest to scientific practice, such as Friedman's (but, as we shall
see, not Kitcher's), also contain the idea of matching.] For further arguments
regarding the deep relation between laws (properly understood) and
(mathematical) models, as described by the semantic view, see Appendix A.
464 This is something Cummins denied in 1977, but remained agnostic about in
his 1983 book. In 1977 he claimed that subsumption, which, as we shall see, he
called the strategy common to formal biology, "[is a word that] captures one
central element in the strategy [common to sciences premised on formal laws and
models] which is absent from, and irrelevant to, the other strategy I want to discuss
[which is the "analytical" explanatory strategy common to compositional
biology]." (1977, p. 272, emphasis mine)

understanding what causal explanation looks like in each of the two forms of
biology.
The other, complementary, sort of explanation, theoretical explanation, is
particularly clear in theoretical physics. The goal of this sort of explanation is for
a more general law or model to account for more specific laws or models. How,
for example, do we "explain" Kepler's laws or hierarchical organization in
biology? Here we seek to use models to explain other models, rather than to
explain concrete cases (the latter amounting to causal explanation).
Often theoretical explanation in formal biology is fairly clear. General
models can be diversified (that is, in my language to be explicated below, either
elaborated or derived) into more specific models using fairly precise mathematical
concretization procedures (such as adding precisely-defined variables to capture
more of the law-like causal structure of formal biology). In this case, the general
model is involved in explaining the more specific model. Furthermore, model
unification (a special "deductive" form of model merging), explained most clearly
by Friedman, plays a particularly important but rare explanatory role in formal
biology, for example with the Price Equation.
Theoretical explanation in compositional biology is, for a variety of
reasons, fairly rare. The theoretical content of compositional biology is much less
structured, in many ways, than that of formal biology. It is difficult, often
impossible, to diversify general models (when they even exist) with primarily
theoretical manipulation (we saw this most clearly in the case, explicated in
Chapter 4, of Davidson's general "cartoon" model of cis-regulatory genetic
elements) – empirical manipulation is crucial. Kitcher's general linguistic account
of theoretical explanation via unification will also not, as I show, work for

262
compositional, or, even, formal, biology. Despite the frequent lack of relevance,
as well as the absence, of theoretical explanation in compositional biology, there
is one sense, at least, in which such explanation exists: (the model of)
compositional hierarchy is explained through the theory (model) of evolution.
The rarity of theoretical explanation suggests that a different picture of
explanation pertains to compositional biology – one in which empirical and
theoretical activity are intimately related.
The distinction between theoretical models and (sets of) concrete cases is a
difficult one to make. When do (sets of) concrete cases become a model? The
minute we abstract away from a single case? The minute we formalize concrete
system behavior in mathematical notation? The minute we use "theoretical" or
"non-observational" vocabulary to describe the concrete cases? (Is it ever possible
not to use such vocabulary?)
There are no easy answers to these, and other related, questions and they
have been extensively discussed in the literature by important figures such as
Hempel, Sellars, van Fraassen, Friedman, and Salmon, among many others. I will
not attempt the impossible task of delimiting or providing criteria for exactly
what sorts of explanations count as causal and which count as theoretical. I
appeal to intuitions we presumably have about which (cases of!) explanation
count as causal and which as theoretical. I also hope that the discussion in this
chapter makes the difference clearer. Certainly, the pictures of explanation that I
develop for each of the two forms of biology is based on, and, in conceptual
feedback fashion, help to clarify the distinction.

5.4 On Causal Capacities as a Form of Causal Explanation
I will now turn to two particular suggestions for how to assess causal
explanation in science each of which is pertinent, respectively, to formal and
compositional biology: Cartwright's and Cummins' view. Note that these views
have limitations that I will mention (e.g., there are disanalogies between
Cartwright's view of causation and exactly what the models of formal biology
are trying to capture, and both Cartwright's and Cummins' views are "causally

monadic" and "causally reductionist" in a sense to be explicated at the end of this
section, 5.4), but my presentation of them is intended as a way to provide
suggestive rather than definitive accounts of causal explanation in the two kinds of
biology.
5.4.1 An Account of Causal Explanation in Formal Biology
There are a variety of views on causal explanation, including Salmon's
classic treatment in Salmon 1984. Here I will focus on Cartwright's view as I
think that it is a paradigmatic case for how causal explanation can be fleshed out
in formal biology. After explicating her view, I will show how it can be applied
to the methodology and theoretical structure of formal biology.
For Cartwright objects have a peculiar kind of property(ies): capacities.
This allows objects to engage in certain processes in particular reliable ways with
other kinds of objects that also have their own capacities. She
maintain[s] that the most general causal claims—like 'aspirins
relieve headaches' or 'electromagnetic forces cause motions
perpendicular to the line of action'—are best rendered as
ascriptions of capacity. For example, aspirins—because of being
aspirins—can cure headaches. The troublesome phrase 'because of
being aspirins' is put there to indicate that the claim is meant to
express a fact about properties and not about individuals: the
property of being an aspirin carries with it the capacity to cure
headaches.465
These capacities are part of the ontology of the world and underlie the causal
(mathematically-presented) laws, which are phenomenological descriptions of
the behavior of different kinds of objects. For Cartwright, the idea of a "capacity"
is a "genuine descriptive concept[], and [is] not in any way to be reduced to more

primitive ideas."466 Other concepts that fall in this category of concepts describing
basic ontological and epistemic primitives are: "[interaction], enabling conditions,
precipitating factors, triggers, inhibitors, preventatives, and the like." Yet,
"capacity" has primacy in Cartwright's view of the world: "[The other concepts]
are the kinds of concept that will have to go into a proper account of what
capacities are and how they operate; that is, in some sequel to this book."467 For
Cartwright, the point of science is the search for capacities.
Formal models mediate this search. Cartwright, for example, describes the
use of causal modeling and path analysis in econometrics as a case of
"probabilistic measures of causality."468 Note that these mathematical techniques
are the same as those in formal biology (in the case of path analysis, they even
originated in Wright's work on heredity469). The diversification and confirmation
of (probabilistic and statistical) mathematical models allow us to infer the
capacities of the objects under study. (1) Causal laws are "deduced" from
probabilities (about the effect a factor has on an outcome) and (2) "causal claims
are claims about capacities."470 Given the way we measure these capacities (under
experimental randomization and control471), we can establish the situations when
the capacity will appear and not be washed out by interactive effects. A strong
capacity is one that makes itself felt in all backgrounds. Such a capacity has
"contextual unanimity."472 Due to interaction (another primitive term that

Cartwright says remarkably little about in her book), contextually unanimous
capacities are not themselves frequent.
Cartwright's program, then, is to infer causes, and ultimately (general)
capacities, from statistical regularities using mathematical models. In her formal
condition CC she defines a factor as a cause iff, by either randomizing or holding
fixed all other possible causes, we note that the effect has a higher probability of
occurring with the cause than without.473 Of course, the idea that all other possible
causes can ever be postulated or found, let alone measured, can be criticized. I
think, however, that Cartwright means this to be a discussion of what we should
strive for. Cartwright's formulation is a way to move from a Humean notion of
cause as "mere regularity" to a modal claim of cause that will support a specific
(and peculiar!) kind of counterfactuals. That is, with her definition, formalism,
and method of calculating cause, she provides a way of abandoning local
Humean skepticism:
[Condition CC] justifies a very local kind of causal claim: if in a
given test population we see the increase in probability that we are
looking for, that guarantees that Cs cause Es there in that population.
But it does not tell us any more. Since it is probabilities and not
mere frequencies that are involved, it is assured that the causing of
Es by Cs will happen regularly—but regularly in that kind of
population. Who knows what happens elsewhere?474
Capacities thus support local counterfactual claims. They, ontologically, underlie
causal laws and models, but they are inferred from such models [see Figure 2.
(5.1)].
                                                  
473 For Cartwright's formalism, see 1989 pp. 55-56. It is important to note that
Cartwright claims that this is a simplified version of a more accurate complex
condition, which, in addition, accounts for causes that "screen off" the focal
cause. See Chapter 3 "Singular Causes First," especially pages 95-98.

Chapter 5
Explanation

Note that there is an unclear connection between her notion of capacity
and her earlier notion, in the 1983 book, of phenomenological and fundamental
(that is, abstract) laws. The search for "causes" is common to, and central in, both
works. However, discussions of explanation are present in the earlier book, but
absent in the later one. In the earlier book she praises explaining by reference to
causes: "Although philosophers generally believe in laws and deny causes,
explanatory practice in physics is just the reverse."475 It is unclear why she
dropped discussions of (causal) explanation in the later book. It is also unclear
what the relation is between causal laws, grounded by capacities (in 1989), and
phenomenological laws (in 1983).
But there are hints about how the two books tie together. My argument is
that the first book is a vindication of the study of causal laws and causal
explanations, which are best described through phenomenological laws: "The
causal story uses highly specific phenomenological laws which tell what happens
in concrete situations."476 The second book is then an attempt to account for what
grounds those causal laws. In 1983 she writes,
The emphasis on getting the causal story right is new for
philosophers of science; and our old theories of explanation477 are
not well-adapted to the job. We need a theory of explanation which
shows the relationship between causal processes and the
fundamental laws we use to study them, and neither my
simulacrum account [of explanation] nor the traditional covering-
law account [of explanation] are of much help.478
This "theory of [causal] explanation" she searches for in 1983 is, I suggest, her
account of causal capacities developed in her 1989 book. Such capacities, as we

have seen, are developed through the use of mathematical models (including
regression and variance analyses), or what she, in 1989, calls causal models:
"given the kinds of very strong assumptions that go into causal models, it is
possible to extract causal information from statistics."479 As I shall explore below,
the more concrete models of quantitative and population genetics, as well as
those of theoretical mathematical ecology, can also be interpreted as causal
models replete with capacities of kinds of objects such as genes, organisms, and
populations.
There is a last piece to the puzzle of how the two books relate: what of the
relation between causal models (using causal laws grounded in capacities) and
phenomenological laws? As we saw, in 1983 (footnote 476 above) she seems to
believe in a direct link between the two. Furthermore, due to her skepticism
about the explanatory status of fundamental laws for concrete situations, which
is captured in the idea of the trade-off between generality and (causal)
explanation discussed in my Chapter 4, we already know that fundamental laws
are not going to be much use in, or be descriptions for, causal models. Given her
1983 skepticism of the (causal) explanatory power480 of fundamental laws and her
                                                  
479 Cartwright 1989, p. 13.
480 It is important to note that Cartwright is ambiguous in her use of "explanatory
power." Sometimes she uses it to refer to theoretical explanation as in her essay
"The Truth Doesn't Explain Much," where unifying and organizing fundamental
laws are taken to explain more concrete laws, but are, strictly speaking false. At
other times, she takes it to mean causal explanation as when she writes:
"Although philosophers generally believe in laws and deny causes, explanatory
practice in physics is just the reverse." (1983, p. 86) I believe that Cartwright's
ambiguity is mitigated by the fact that she is at least clear in each use of
"explanatory power" and "explanation." Given her own focus on causal
explanation, unless otherwise stated, I will use "explanatory power" and
"explanation" to refer to causal explanation. I can, therefore, legitimately contrast it
with generality and unification, which are endemic to theoretical explanation. I
thank Elisabeth Lloyd for discussion on this point.

relating of causal models and phenomenological laws, one is surprised to find
that in 1989 she claims that the phenomenological laws attached to concrete
representations of a laser481, both in the form of a diagram and in the form of "a
highly complex" phenomenological law ("equation") involve "no causality."482
What is the solution to this inconsistency between the two books? The
purity of the link between causal models and phenomenological laws is already
suspect in 1983. There is an inconsistency: in motivating her simulacrum account
of explanation, she makes a distinction between "phenomenological" terms in
laws and "a more detailed 'causal' construction."483 So there is actually already a
tension in Cartwright's 1983 book: causal models rely on phenomenological laws
in their articulation and presentation (p. 11), but there is also something deeper
or different about causal explanation (pp. 225-226). The relation between
phenomenological laws and causal explanation thus remains opaque. Despite
this inconsistency, which spills over into her wholesale ignoring of
phenomenological laws in 1989, it is clear that, at bottom, Cartwright wants to
get at causal explanation through causal modeling of causal capacities.
Let us now turn to how compatible this account of capacities and causal
modeling is with the practice of modeling in formal biology. Cartwright's
account of capacities is meant to be a general account of capacities, but it is
undoubtedly true that it applies best to those sciences that measure, and infer,
capacities in a mathematical manner using probabilistic effects of simple kinds of
objects in a rich mathematical theoretical framework with relatively few and

only place in this book that she mentions phenomenological laws.

mathematically well-articulated forces, expressed in the form of laws.
Cartwright's account of capacities does not suit compositional biology well since
assessment of causal capacities in terms of probabilities to change certain
outcomes is not even an aspect of explanation there. Furthermore, Cartwright
does not in any way appeal to the importance of cause in a hierarchically-
structured system. Hence, we can rule out the applicability of her account to
compositional biology, and hence the complete generality of her account.
In the models of formal biology capacities are inferred, in a justified
manner, when conditions of the model are met, and its predictions confirmed.
Consider a model in which the presence of a particular object (allele D) will
increase the probability of survival, in a particular amount, given particular
background conditions (e.g., randomization or fixation of other genes which
interact epistatically with D; assumptions of constant environmental conditions).
If this model is confirmed, we will have captured one capacity of allele D (i.e., its
fitness effect on the organism). Given the probabilistic interpretation(s) of fitness
(and even mutation and genetic drift), the mathematical structures of
evolutionary genetics are compatible with Cartwright's probabilistic framework.
In Cartwright's framework, a capacity is expressed in mathematical terms of
increasing the probability of an event occurring, such as the capacity of a gene type to
affect individual survival. Other capacities include the mutation rate of a gene
type, which measures its proclivity to change during a particular amount of time
(or, operationally, out of a particular sampling population).
When the model proposes the capacity, and when the model is confirmed,
then the causal capacity serves an explanatory role, in the causal sense, in the
dynamics of the theoretical model of formal biology and in that bit of the

concrete system. That is, the capacity(ies) of the referent kinds of objects
provide(s) an account of why the objects in the model behave the way that they
do. Note that this manner of speaking could be interpreted as having
metaphysical realist import484, but I prefer to think of it as a legitimate way to
understand the theoretical structure, and theoretical claims, of formal biology.
Their explanations do aim for something more than just empirical adequacy –
                                                  
484 Cartwright seems to be a realist, both in her own right and certainly as
compared to van Fraassen, who is explicitly an anti-realist. Although she
distances herself from either a defense or an attack of scientific realism (1989, p.
162) and although she endorses a "radical empiricism" in that every "cause and
capacity" has to be measured and tested (1989, p. 167), she also notes that
"capacities are much like essences. If you are committed to the assumption that
all the internal properties of electrons are essential, this makes science a lot easier
for you. You can measure the charge or mass on one, and you know it on all the
others." (1989, p. 146). [Note that this is a version of my claim of the equivalence of
the simple kinds of objects of formal biology, which all have the same kinds of
properties, such as fitness values and mutation rates of mathematical
evolutionary genes (though, unlike the simple kinds of objects of physics, the
actual values are not equivalent).] Furthermore, she claims that we should "take
capacities seriously as things in the world, and not just particularly strong
modalities, [and] they should remain intact from one kind of situation to another.
But that does not mean that there can be no exceptions; it means that any
exception requires a reason [for example, the existence of interaction between
capacities]." (1989, p. 162) Now, determining the exact extent and interpretation
of Cartwright's realism is distracting for my purposes. I do think that
Cartwright's formalized notion of capacity nicely captures what formal biologists
do when they elaborate mathematically-idealized models and attempt to capture
and explain the causal structure of the world as they see it. Her analysis also
suggests that scientists attempt to do more in their explanations than merely
have their models be empirically adequate within a context (van Fraassen's
account still remains an important component of an analysis of scientific
explanation). Ultimately, all I want to take away from Cartwright's, van
Fraassen's, Cummins', and Friedman's distinct views on explanation is a set of
distinct conceptual resources to describe the varying practices of causal and
theoretical explanation in the two different kinds of biology explored in my
dissertation. I remain agnostic about the merits or demerits of particular
ontological attitudes that either may be, or are, correlated with these views, for
advocacy of any particular ontological attitude on my part would distract from
my analysis of the practice of providing scientific explanations in very different
contexts.

they want to understand what the mathematically idealized objects and
processes of their theories do.
Although the matching between Cartwright's framework and other formal
biological sciences, such as theoretical mathematical ecology, is less
straightforward, in those sciences particular objects types, such as individual
organisms do also have particular statistical capacities (e.g., average number of
offspring, average lifespan, impact on resources), which, for particular
conditions, affect the probability of certain outcomes (e.g., the total population
size having a certain value). That is, even in the models of ecology, individual
organisms have capacities that will affect the properties of the effect being
measured (i.e., properties of the population).
Cartwright's capacity talk can therefore also be read, without too much
difficulty, into the mathematical idealized models of ecology, where
"functional"485 relations between (1) independent and (2) dependent variables are
sought. The "effect" can be interpreted as a particular value for a particular
dependent variable and then the value(s) of the independent variables,
represented as properties of the cause (e.g., average lifespan of an individual
organism), are the ones that affect the probability of that particular effect (e.g.,
population size) occurring. The mathematical models of both mathematical
evolutionary genetics and theoretical mathematical ecology are built from
theoretical resources regarding the mathematical idealization of the causes and
objects of the theory. The causal structure of the theory is contained in
mathematical formalizations from which the models are built. It is these

idealizations that can be matched with Cartwright's formulation of causal
capacities. These causal capacities are explanatory of the outcomes of the model.
There are some imperfections in the comparison that I want to make.
Although the formal models of population genetics do try to get at the causal
structure of the concrete system under study, they are not explicitly concerned
with causes, and formulations such as CC, in the way that Cartwright is. Their
models can be reinterpreted and reconstructed, to a large extent, in this way, but
doing this would, admittedly, take some work. Furthermore, as we shall see in
Appendix A, sometimes the models of formal biology cannot actually give us
causal information since sufficient empirical information is sometimes simply
lacking – the parameters of a certain model cannot be filled in and, therefore,
adjudicating between various contrasting models cannot be done (Cartwright too
admits that limited data is often a problem in determining causes). In those cases,
the correct causal model cannot be confirmed. Also, although formal biologists
do want to get at causal structure, it is unclear whether they would accept and
adopt Cartwright's fairly strong (and unique) version of causal structure in terms
of causal capacities. They might prefer to adopt another set of concepts regarding
causation that would also be consistent with their models.
Despite this, it is clear that there is significant overlap in methodology and
goals, regarding causal explanation, between Cartwright's research program of
finding causal capacities and the research program of formal biology to produce
models capturing the causal structure of mathematically-interpreted concrete
systems. As I said above, it is beyond the scope of this dissertation to further
compare, for example, Glymour's or Salmon's statistical accounts of cause with

Cartwright's and, more generally, with formal biology. This certainly should be
done.
5.4.2 An Account of Causal Explanation in Compositional Biology
In compositional biology, a very different explanatory pattern exists. As
discussed in the section on van Fraassen above, the aim and structure of causal
explanations in formal and compositional biology differ radically. The clearest
and most detailed version of causal explanation pertinent to compositional
biology can be found in Cummins' explication of causal capacities.486 However,
other scholars such as Kauffman and Wimsatt have also analyzed causal
explanations in a manner pertinent to compositional biology (Kauffman's
"articulation of parts" explanations and Wimsatt's account of "functional
explanation"). Future work should include an explication of Kauffman's and
Wimsatt's views on explanation. Here I focus on Cummins because his view ties
in clearly to, and is explicitly contrasted with, the received philosophy of science
literature on explanation, which pertains, almost exclusively, to formal biology.
Cummins view applies to different systems and sets of problems; it also appeals
to very different contrast classes and relevance relations, to use the language that
van Fraassen usefully articulated.
Cummins, in the philosophy of biology literature, is best known for his
"causal role" analysis of function. But he considers this analysis to be an aspect of
a more general explanatory pattern. Cummins' account is extremely important
and topical for my purposes. It is therefore worthwhile spending some time
unpacking it.

275
Cummins claims that there are two explanatory strategies, subsumption
and analysis pertinent to two kinds of theory, transition and property theories.487
Transition theories seek "to explain changes of state in a system as effects of
previous causes—typically disturbances in the system."488 And the way such
explanations are effected is by "subsumption under causal law."489 This is done
by trying "to fix on a set of state variables for the system that will allow one to
exhibit each change of state as a function of a disturbing event and the state of
the system at the time of the disturbance."490 These functions, or transformations,
are the causal laws. Note that Cummins analysis of transition theories and
subsumption is a semantic theoretic one since he is essentially appealing to laws of
succession. Cummins distinguishes between subsumption of concrete
phenomena under causal laws (causal explanation) and subsumption of a causal
law under a more general causal law (theoretical explanation).491 Cummins is
insensitive to the multiplicity of analyses on causal laws and the differences

491 Cummins 1983, pp. 5-6, where he distinguishes "explanation of individual
events" from "explanation of event-types." Here he adds that subsumptive
explanation fundamentally requires analytical explanation, to be discussed
below, since subsumptive explanation alone does not explain the dispositions
(capacities) that the objects referred to by causal laws have. I would add, as
argued below, that analysis also requires subsumption, even if that is not the
central relation. Either explanatory strategy, appeals to causal capacities of its
objects and  the constituent parts of the objects. Both Cartwright and Cummins
argue that at some level capacities (dispositions) become irreducible and
"primitive." No further explanation can be provided. What is different between
the two explanatory strategies is (1) where the capacities lie, (2) what they do, (3)
how they are theoretically expressed, and (4) how they are structured. In the
subsumptive explanatory strategy they lie in the object and are described in
formal terms. In the analytical explanatory strategy, dispositions of an object are
explained in terms of dispositions of its (hierarchically-organized) parts. Such
dispositions are often described in qualitative terms.

between semantic and syntactic accounts of theories, for which the subsumptive
(or "matching" – see footnote 463 above) pattern of explanation is central. Part of
the reason for these lacunae is that he is not particularly concerned with the
subsumptive pattern of explanation, which, he claims in a massively understated
manner, is "more familiar" to "philosophers and methodologically minded
scientists."492 Good examples of causal subsumption are explanations of
pendulum or planetary motion or explanations of changes in gene frequencies in
populations. Cartwright's account of causation is also a case of this pattern. It is,
in fact, the explanatory pattern that has completely dominated philosophy of
science analysis.
Property theories493, and the analytical strategy of explanation that they
involve, are the subject of Cummins' book (and 1975 article). Let me present
Cummins' own wording:
The characteristic question answered by a property theory is: What
is it for system S to have property P?
The natural strategy for answering such a question is to
construct an analysis [including the pertinent model(s)] of S that
explains S's possession of P by appeal to the properties of S's
components and their mode of organization. The process often has
as a preliminary stage an analysis of P itself into properties of S or
S's components. This step will loom large when we come to discuss
complex dispositional properties such as information-processing
capacities. Analysis of a system will be called compositional
analysis, to distinguish it from analysis of a property, which will be
called functional analysis when the property is dispositional, and
property analysis when the property is not dispositional. Analysis
is "recursive," since a given analysis may appeal to properties or
components that themselves require analysis.494

distinction between them, as well as the mismatch between them and the two
explanatory strategies, at the end of this section on Cummins.
494 Cummins 1983, p. 15.

Chapter 5
Explanation
277
It is precisely in the context of analytical explanations that Cummins developed
his account of functional explanation – these are cases where the property being
explained has a disposition, a capacity, to do something within the system (the
whole) under investigation from a particular theoretical perspective. Note the
overall pattern of explanation in analytical explanations: a system is broken
down into components at the next lowest level. These components have a
particular organization vis-à-vis one another. This "compositional analysis" is to
be distinguished from, but is a necessary preliminary for, "functional/property
analysis" which involves the explanation of the system property in terms of the
properties of its components. Both the partitioning of the system into components,
and the ascription of hierarchical properties (capacities) to the system and its
components, have to be done appropriately for an analytical explanation to work
successfully: "Successful analysis yields an explanatory payoff when we come to
see that something having the kinds of components specified, organized in the
way specified, is bound to have the target property."495
Note that the analysis is "recursive." Once we explain a system in terms of
the properties of its components one level down, we might desire to continue
going down levels recursively until we reach some sort of atomic parts. In his
article, he opaquely and provocatively claims that we should continue "until
pure physiology takes over, i.e. until the analyzing capacities are amenable to the
subsumption strategy."496 This sentence is conspicuously absent from an
otherwise identical passage on page 29 of Cummins 1983. In the book, he merely
hints that we should stop at the "elementary parts" that are deemed as such by

the theory in question: for example the elementary parts of "the theory of
bonding" are "atoms."497 The recursions of compositional and
functional/property analysis end where the theoretical perspective coordinating
the analysis suggests that they should. Furthermore, the theory is the one that
picks out the system capacity of explanatory interest. These aspects of Cummins'
view are highly naturalized – they appeal to the scientific theory to perform both
the compositional, and the property, partitioning.
One point I would like to add to Cummins' account is that subsumption
(matching) is not "absent" or "irrelevant" to compositional and functional
analyses, as Cummins claims in 1977. In fact, theoretical models suggest and
motivate the partitioning of both organization and capacities. Furthermore, the
models representing this partitioning are changed in response to empirical
findings regarding the validity and utility of the partitioning. Although
theoretical manipulation rarely happens independently of empirical
manipulation in compositional biology, there is a matching between theoretical
models and concrete systems in compositional biology (it is a much less
important relation compared to the one in formal biology since in compositional
biology, models can be changed with impunity). Subsumption is thus not absent
and irrelevant here, although it plays a different and smaller role than in formal
biology. I also believe that when Cummins talks about an actual analytical
explanation, he refers to a model that serves an important explanatory role. He is
not referring to a partitioning in the concrete. For Cummins, models are related
in important ways to explanation.
                                                  
497 Cummins 1983, p. 27.

Chapter 5
Explanation
279
The power of an analytical explanation lies in the relationship between the
causal capacities of the components and the capacity of the system. Cummins
argues:
 The explanatory interest of functional analysis is roughly
proportional to (i) the extent to which the analyzing capacities are
less sophisticated than the analyzed capacities, (ii) the extent to
which the analyzing capacities are different in kind from the
analyzed capacities, and (iii) the relative sophistication of the
program appealed to—i.e., the relative complexity of the
organization of the component parts/processes that is attributed to
the system. (iii) is correlative with (i) and (ii): the greater the gap in
sophistication and kind between analyzing capacities and the
analyzed capacity, the more sophisticated the program must be to
close the gap.498
Cummins' picture of a powerful analytical explanation is this: a system capacity,
chosen by the theoretical perspective at hand499, is partitioned into simpler, and
different in kind, component capacities. The simpler and more different in kind
part capacities are, the more complex the program for integrating these
interacting capacities must be.
A number of problems do arise from Cummins' account. First of all, what
is the nature, status, and role of the "program"? Cognitive capacities and
cognitive information-processing are the investigative domain of Cummins'
research program. His book, most of which I shall not discuss, is replete with
information-centered language and analysis. He distinguishes between
"descriptive" and "interpretive" analysis.500 Descriptive analysis, which he barely

499 For example: "Unlike the states of a digital computer, the states of natural
systems do not have standard or intended interpretations. They are assigned
semantic significance in order to explain the system's capacities." (Cummins

capacities to be explained.

spends any time on, but which I believe is the central form of analysis in
compositional biology, is analysis in terms of the material mechanisms of the system.
Interpretative analysis is done in terms of symbols that have semantic
interpretations and import. Cummins believes that this is the proper form of
analysis for cognitive information-processing systems.
Here I part ways with him. Although I have little to say about cognition, I
believe that a proper functional analysis (to use his term) of biological systems
should rely on descriptive analysis. Such a descriptive analysis involves the
models pertinent to compositional biology. Thus, returning to the question
regarding the nature, status, and role of program, I do not believe that a
"program" is a useful metaphor, yet alone an explanation, of how capacities of
system components aggregate to form a system capacity in biology. Information-
integration will not, for example, explain how the parts of the circulatory system,
with their different capacities [e.g., pumping (heart), distributing nutrient and
oxygen rich blood (arteries), distributing nutrients and oxygen by distributing
blood (capillaries), and returning, using one-way valves, depaupered blood to
the pump (veins)], contribute to the overall capacity of the circulatory system of
distributing nutrients and gases to the body.
This then leads to the question of which metaphor or explanation will
allow us to account for how part-capacities, less sophisticated and different in
kind, are integrated to form a system capacity. Unfortunately, I think that no good
philosophical account of this exists and I am not ready to offer one. Cartwright
already provides a view to this general problem when she notes that interaction
(of capacities) is a primitive term or process, and that she too does not have an

Chapter 5
Explanation
281
account of capacity interaction.501  Note, though, one difference between
Cartwright's and Cummins' notions of capacities: unlike Cartwright's, Cummins'
capacities are explicitly hierarchical.  Thus, under Cummins' picture, (lower-level)
capacities are always going to interact – they have to do this in order to produce a
higher-level property.
There is, however, an ambiguity in the term "interaction": it can be
additive or non-additive. Cummins captures this ambiguity by distinguishing
between "morphological" (additive interaction) and "systematic" (non-additive
interaction) analysis, which is meant to be orthogonal to his "descriptive" and
"interpretive" distinction.502  Regardless of the existence or absence of additivity,
however, (lower-level) capacities have to "interact" on Cummins hierarchical
picture, but not on Cartwright's potentially-sole-object-expressing-its-capacity
(e.g., a mass in a gravitational field) picture, where a single capacity can explain
object behavior.
Although there is no satisfactory philosophical account of capacity
integration (which includes, in my vocabulary, both additive and non-additive
capacity interaction), one person who has provided some grounds for such an
analysis is William Wimsatt.503 But he also simply assumes that there is going to
be some relation between part capacities and system capacity, without giving an
account of what that relation would philosophically amount to, whether it be an
additive or non-additive interactive relationship. For example, Wimsatt writes:
Suppose that system and parts' properties are related in a
theory by a function, F:
Pj(S) = F[p1, …, pn(s1);…;p1, …, pn(sm)],
                                                  
501 See Cartwright 1989, p. 166.

503 See Wimsatt 1972, 1974, 1986, and 1997.

Chapter 5
Explanation
282
Where Pj(S) is a system property, s1 through sm are parts of system S
under an exhaustive and exclusive decomposition, and p1 through
pm are properties possessed by these parts. 504
Nowhere does Wimsatt give a general philosophical account of how the function
F actually does what it is supposed to do: integrate part properties (capacities) to
produce the system capacity. Wimsatt has provided an account of functional
loops which is a beginning for explaining how part capacities, at a particular
level depend on one another505; but this dependence does not explain how a new
kind of, under Cummins' view, more sophisticated higher-level capacity, comes
about.506 Nor does Wimsatt give an analysis of how the multiple capacities
ascribed to each part kind relate to one another for each part kind, or even how
and whether part kinds overlap in capacities. Furthermore, while Wimsatt does
talk about "cooperative or inhibitory interactions," he assumes them (as a way to
find system non-aggregativity) and does not describe them philosophically.507
These criticisms are not intended to undermine the utility of Wimsatt's
analysis for describing when a system can be considered aggregative and when it
cannot. But I also think that capacity integration from a lower level to a higher
one is an important outstanding philosophical problem necessary for discussing
causal capacities pertinent to compositional biology. Cummins' informational
"program" explanation will not do the biological trick; Cartwright has no account
(and is not committed to describing hierarchical systems anyway); Wimsatt has
provided grounds, but has not provided an analysis.

Chapter 5
Explanation
283
Let me, then, provide a few brief suggestions for such an analysis. First,
the integration of the capacities requires an explicit causal story, a narrative
model, of exactly how the causal capacities fit together ("articulate," to use
Kauffman's term) and how, through this precise causal articulation, a higher-
level causal capacity arises. That is, careful attention must be paid to the precise
qualitative dispositions of the parts. This can best be done through a narrative
model complemented by diagrams such as functional flow charts and more
concrete structural diagrams representing material structures, such as arteries,
capillaries, and veins. The qualitative nature of the system capacity must be
carefully and intuitively partitioned into a series of qualitative part capacities
that can clearly account for the system capacity. What I have just provided is not
an account; it is a sketch, or at least a "functional specification"508 of what must go
into an account of how part capacities become system capacities under particular
theoretical perspectives. Note that I stress the unique qualitative nature of part
capacities and the role of models pertinent to compositional biology, such as
narrative and diagrammatic models.
With regard to propositional non-mathematical models, Cummins too
emphasized their utility for compositional and functional analysis:
We can easily imagine biologists expressing their analyses in a form
analogous to the schematic diagrams of electronics, with special
symbols for pumps, conduits, filters, and so on. Indeed if
transplants and implants ever become commonplace, this is the
only sort of description that would achieve real generality.509

761. For a direct application of Cummins' view, see how he interprets Freud's
theories using intricate flow charts on pages 142-161 of his 1983. Eric Davidson's
logical model, discussed in Chapter 4, is a very pertinent example of this too.

Chapter 5
Explanation
284
Given the intimate relation between form (and organization) and function, the
role of diagrammatic models expressing form in providing representations for
the production of analytical explanations using (functional) causal capacities, is
clear. For example, in the Krebs cycle case described in Chapter 4, the chemical
models describing the structure of the molecules involved provide the grounds
for displaying the capacities of the molecules (including the catalytic enzymes).
These individual part capacities explain how the Krebs cycle occurs and how
system behavior, such as production of ATP and production of carbon dioxide
from molecular oxygen, ensue.
An analogous hierarchical story could be told for the diagrammatic
models representing structures and, ultimately, capacities, in Bramble and
Wake's model of feeding. As considered in my discussion of the general
properties of models in Chapter 4, these models allow for the discovery, as well
as the representation, of the capacities of the objects that, ultimately, explain, in
an analytical way, the processes occurring. These models attempt to capture the
qualitative unique capacities of numerous object types, organized in a
hierarchical and integrated fashion. The mathematical models of formal biology
make no assumptions about hierarchical organization and certainly make no
claims about hierarchical integration; furthermore, these models are
mathematically idealized and capture the properties of the objects in terms of a
few key variables that specify trajectories through an idealized state space.
Cummins' analysis, including the models it requires, pertains to compositional
biology, whereas Cartwright's analysis of causal modeling and capacities
underlying it, and inferred from it, pertains to formal biology.

Chapter 5
Explanation
285
I have elaborated on Cummins' framework for two reasons: (1) his
account of the analytical explanatory strategy, which includes his account of
functional explanation, directly pertains to explanation via models in
compositional biology; this is so despite the fact that I disagree with him fairly
early on in his account – I adopt neither informational analysis or language, nor
the notion of a program. (2) His contrast between subsumptive and analytical510
explanatory strategies exactly instantiates the distinct explanatory strategies in the
two kinds of biology I distinguish: formal and compositional. Thus, I think that
his analysis of two general explanatory strategies bolsters my distinction
between formal and compositional analysis – this corroboration occurs despite
the fact that he glosses over important differences (e.g., syntactic and semantic
views) in the "subsumptive (matching) explanatory strategy" camp.
I do not, however, agree with Cummins that these two explanatory
strategies correlate neatly with transition and property theories, respectively.
While there certainly is a case to be made that transition theories [which, under a
semantic interpretation, are specified by a state space and laws of coexistence
and succession (or "transition")] are often amenable to subsumption and that
property theories can be adequately explained by analysis, the correlation is not
strict. For example, a number of transition theories, such as a theory of biological
development (a transitional process par excellence), are certainly better dealt
with by (compositional and functional) analysis, while transition theories of
physics subject to subsumption can, under Cartwright's view of capacities, be
reinterpreted as property theories with (mathematically modeled) capacities as
primitives. The distinction between transition and property theories is not
                                                  
510 Which, I argue, does include subsumption!

Chapter 5
Explanation
286
necessarily a neat one and it certainly does not map on cleanly onto subsumption
and analysis explanatory strategies (although there is a correlation). However,
subsumptive and analytical strategies are distinct and describe accurately the
causal explanatory efforts, through the use of different general kinds of causal
modeling, of formal and compositional biology.
One weakness common to the causal explanatory pattern of both
Cartwright and Cummins is their emphasis on capacities and their sidestepping
of the process of interaction. They have a quintessentially partitioned way of
explaining causality through the modeling of particular causal factors or
capacities of objects (or parts) of concrete systems. Their views are causally
"monadic" and "reductionist"511 in this sense. Note that their views stand in stark
contrast to views that could emphasize the interaction terms in formal equations,
or mechanistic interaction between parts of a system. Oyama's or Lewontin's
philosophically-oriented views on these matters provide material for a view that
starts from interaction (see footnote 163). What would causal explanation in
formal and compositional biology look like if, instead of averaging or controlling
the capacities across contexts to derive "additive" overall capacities, we started
with context and looked at interaction in each kind of context (i.e., we did not
attempt to find "contextually unanimous" Cartwright capacities and we focused
on integration among Cummins capacities)?512 This would be a "holistic"513
                                                  
511 In footnote 177, I mentioned the different meanings of reductionism explicated
by Sarkar 1998 and Zucker 1996.
512 Goodnight and Wade 2000 explicitly suggest this: "If we were to offer a
prescription for constructing such [genetic] models, we would suggest building a
model with only interactions between genes and, from it, derive the mean additive
effects of the component genes and the variances about the means." (p. 319)
513 See Winther 2003 in press for an argument for replacing "holism" and
"reductionism" with, respectively, "articulation" and "partitioning."

alternative to the "reductionism" of Cartwright and Cummins. It remains unclear,
however, how this would be done. The point, though, is that Cartwright's and
Cummins' view, respectively, are one way to flesh out causal explanation in each
kind of biology.

5.5 Theoretical Explanation and Confirmation in Formal Biology
I now want to turn to the relation between laws and law-based models at
different levels of generality in formal biology. That is, I want to turn to how these
theoretical components of formal biology are explained. This is a complex topic
for which I will develop a taxonomy of different ways of concretizing and
abstracting. Modeling as an activity independent of empirical activity is of
crucial importance in formal biology. This is why, for example, semantic analyses
are so powerful in understanding population genetics, which has a rich
mathematical structure. This is also why theoretical explanation, confirmation,
and causal explanation can be neatly distinguished in formal biology (but, as we
shall see, not in compositional biology).
5.5.1 An Account of Theoretical Explanation via Theoretical Unification
First I want to turn to Friedman's views on theoretical unification as a way
to explain laws and models. Friedman has developed a detailed account of how
unification guides theoretical explanation.514 Here I want to first explicate the
pertinent aspects of Friedman's view and then, in the next section, show they
apply to the modeling activity of formal biology.

5.5.1.1 Friedman's "Theoretical World" and My Theoretical
Perspectives
How exactly does theoretical explanation occur? Consider Friedman's
notion of a "theoretical world" into which, he believes, we embed concrete
cases.515 Causal explanation516, then, would be the direct embedding of concrete
cases into some theoretical world, whereas theoretical explanation involves
finding embedding—and other sorts of—relations between abstract entities (i.e.,
laws and models) in the theoretical world. Friedman defines a theoretical world
in the following way: "some larger, relatively abstract and unobservable
theoretical [formal mathematical!] structure [of theoretical physics]."517 This is a
fairly rigid and precise definition appealing to the formal mathematics of
physical theory. Friedman's definition is itself embedded in the context of a
theoretical and static representational orientation in philosophy of science [see
Table 6. (4.1)]. For simplification and theoretical reasons, it glosses over
difficulties in individuating such a theoretical world. That is, how do we account
for theoretical "practice," and what relationship do we see between theoretical
and empirical aspects?518 Furthermore it is also unclear how we should discuss
the role models play in this theoretical world, particularly if we in any way
consider them as independent from theory, as is the case in the mediating
models view. These concerns are not Friedman's – he is focusing on the (highly)
theoretical structure of relativity theory.

 Despite the legitimacy of the notion of "theoretical world" at
distinguishing causal from theoretical explanation in theoretical physics, I seek
something broader. I am concerned with the messy practice, theoretical and
empirical alike, of biology.519 Recall the notion of theoretical perspective
discussed in Chapter 2. Theoretical perspectives are broad and are—in a manner
anathema to Friedman's ultimate goal of finding ways to theoretically
unify—often unrelated and sometimes even in tension with one another. But I do
think that the idea of theoretical perspectives as coordinating models,
methodologies, and theories, via biases and guiding assumptions, for local
purposes, encompasses the theoretical, humanly-constructed, world that
Friedman, for a particular discipline, captures with his notion of "theoretical
world." My account of theoretical perspectives seeks to incorporate practices and
also non-mathematical theoretical accounts, such as Cummins' analytical
explanatory strategy. I thus think of Friedman's notion of "theoretical world" as
an instantiation520 of my notion of theoretical perspective.
The contrast between causal and theoretical explanation is thus,
respectively, that between (1) explaining the behavior of concrete systems (i.e.,
using a model to provide an explanation – this involves empirical activity) and
(2) explaining the relations between theoretical structures at different levels of
generality (i.e., this is done primarily through theoretical activity). This
                                                  
519 Certainly concrete physics is complex and rich too – I take that to be one of the
points of Cartwright's work. Friedman and Cartwright, as we have and shall see,
stand at opposite ends of many spectra. I think that both of their views can be of
use, in different ways, in my analysis of formal biology.
520 It is also a partial instantiation – Friedman does not consider experimental
methodologies that are related to the theoretical world he describes.

difference can be clearly seen using Friedman's notion of a theoretical world.
However, the difference, as we shall see, is not clear in compositional biology.
5.5.1.2 Theoretical Unification
Now that I have provided further motivation for the distinction between
causal and theoretical explanation, let us turn to Friedman's particular version of
theoretical explanation. In his first attempt at developing his views, he claimed
that there was an important connection between theoretical explanation and
scientific understanding – namely that when a unification, that is, a subsumption
of a series of different laws under one more general law, occurs, the scope and
depth of our understanding increases (i.e., cognitive burden decreases) and this
process is a theoretical explanation.521 "Science increases our understanding of the
world," Friedman writes, "by reducing the total number of independent
phenomena that we have to accept as ultimate or given."522 That is, if we can
show how more specific laws or models can be embedded into a more general
one, the empirical consequences of each previously independent law or model
can be shown to be related in that they can now be derived from a more general
law or model.
Given his primarily (but not exclusively nor even importantly!) syntactic
view of theories, with which he can interpret empirical consequences as
sentences, Friedman claims that such a generalization relation implies that we
have then effected a reduction in the total number of "independently acceptable
                                                  
521 Friedman 1974.
522 Friedman 1974, p. 15.

Chapter 5
Explanation
292
sentences."523 Such a reduction implies that we require fewer distinct explanatory
theoretical resources (laws, models, assumptions, etc.) and, thus, we have
increased our (unified) understanding of the world. Friedman provides an
example:
The kinetic theory [of gases] effects a significant unification in what
we have to accept. Where we once had three independent brute
facts524—that gases approximately obey the Boyle-Charles law525,
that they obey Graham's law [of diffusion]526, and that they have
the specific-heat capacities they do have—we now have only
one—that molecules obey the laws of mechanics.527
The kinetic theory of gases reduces the total number of empirical consequences,
or sentences, that we have to take as independent. It has unifying power, and
therefore increases our scientific understanding.
In later work, Friedman fleshed out his view of the relations between
theoretical explanation, unification, understanding, and reduction in terms of a
meta-model of hierarchical model reduction which appeals to (1) realism, and
which provides further grounds for (2) analyzing the confirmation relation
between evidence (about concrete systems) and theory (the "theoretical world").
                                                  
523 Friedman 1974, p. 16.
524 By "brute facts," Friedman simply means independent phenomena (or
generalizations of phenomena). He does not mean this to contrast with empirical
generalizations ("phenomenological laws") – the first two in his list are precisely
such generalizations. (Friedman, pers. comm., September 2, 2003)
525 PV = nRT.
526 "Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, rates of diffusion for
gaseous substances [r] are inversely proportional to the square roots of their
molar masses [M]." i.e.:
r1/ r2 = (M2/ M1)1/2
(See Chang 1994, p. 190)
527 Friedman 1974, pp. 14-15. Friedman further claims that the kinetic theory can
be unified with planetary behavior and falling body behavior under the laws of
mechanics, according to which all bodies behave. There are, however, other forces
involved in the behaviors of real gases besides the laws of mechanics, such as
Van der Waals forces. In the 1974 article (but not the 1983 book), Friedman
glosses over this.

Chapter 5
Explanation
293
Briefly, Friedman contrasts reductive and representational theoretical
inferences (explanations). Reductive theoretical inferences are ones where realism
is assumed and that, therefore, relating observable objects (and their respective
properties/relations) of one kind of theory (e.g., gas and gas laws) with the
objects (and their respective properties/relations) of another kind of theory (e.g.,
molecules and chemical laws) can be done in a powerful and unifying way:
The important point here is that, on a literal construal of A [i.e., the
general theoretical model], our theory evolves by conjunction. Certain
assumptions about A  play a role in the explanation of the gas laws.
These same assumptions, in conjunction with further assumptions
about A, play a role in the latter explanation of chemical
combination.528
It is the overall postulation of realism that allows us to "carry-over" or conjoin the
assumptions and models of one observational domain into another observational
domain. We are assuming that different theoretical models are describing the
same objects, properties, and relations. When we unify or conjoin objectively
here, we reduce the number of independently acceptable empirical consequences
and the number of independent observational domains. Note that "reduction" is
a loaded term – here the strength of unification lies not in reduction to
                                                  
528 Friedman 1983, p. 245; see also Friedman 1981, p. 4. Morrison 2000, pp. 38-52
critiques Friedman's account of reduction by claiming that unification is
primarily a theoretical claim not tied to mechanism in any way. By Morrison
adopting Cartwright's trade-off between (causal) explanatory power and
(theoretical) generality, she endorses a general framework anathema to
Friedman's. As I have discussed in Chapter 4 and here immediately below,
because of their differing assumptions regarding abstraction, Cartwright and
Friedman do not, and cannot, see eye to eye on the matter of theoretical
reduction.

microstructural mechanism, but in theoretical reduction to a broadened
observational scope of a higher-level theoretical structure.529
If we do not postulate realism, Friedman claims, then we cannot
objectively conjoin distinct models and expect to infer a more general model. In
such merely representational cases (observational objects, together with their
properties/relations are only represented by a mathematical structure), "all
initial assumptions about A have been 'trapped' within the scope [of the
representation]." No objective, non-arbitrary, conjoining with other models,
either at the same or higher level of generality, could then occur: "Under this …
construal, A can be thought of as a purely mathematical object. It is no longer
necessary to attribute physical reality to A, since we no longer literally identify
elements of the concrete [system] with elements of A."530
In the context of the interpretation of mere representation, Friedman's
model of explanation is riddled with the problem of "arbitrary law-conjunction"
that was one of the downfalls of the positivist's deductive-nomological model of
explanation. This is why Friedman prefers the realist interpretation. Recently,
however, Friedman has desired to downplay the strongly realist interpretation
while still maintaining the importance of both the unification of models and the
reduction of independently acceptable empirical consequences.531 His recent
position works well in the context of my agnosticism about ontological attitudes
                                                  
529 Friedman explained this to me in conversation (July 9, 2003).

295
(see footnote 484). It is not clear, however, how such agnosticism is to be
implemented in the context of Friedman's earlier account.
Let us now turn to confirmation. Friedman's emphasis on theoretical
explanation is so large, that for him the world comes in primarily as a way to
confirm the laws and models at various levels of generality. He is not at all
concerned with causal explanation – i.e., with subsuming concrete situations
under particular laws in order to explain—to focus—on the concrete situation
itself. The world merely confirms, it is not itself in need of explanation. Put differently,
Friedman is concerned with the formal relations of the "theoretical world" rather
than with causal relations of, and in, the "concrete world" (explained by the
theoretical world). This, of course, stands in stark contrast to Cartwright's and
Cummins' concerns with causal explanation.
Although Friedman does not have a clear account of the confirmation
relation532, he does know what such a relation is supposed to do in the context of
the theoretical world. The important point Friedman wants to make is that "a
total theory rich in higher-level structure is likely to be better confirmed than a
total theory staying on the phenomenological level, even though the latter theory
may have precisely the same observational consequences as the former."533 This is
because
the theoretical description [of the phenomenology of a gas] receives
confirmation from indirect evidence—from chemical phenomena,
thermal and electrical phenomena, and the like—which it then
'transfers' to the phenomenological description. If the
phenomenological description is removed from the context of
                                                  
532 In conversation he noted that to a "0th approximation," the positivist's
hypothetico-deductive method of confirmation was accurate.
533 Friedman 1983, p. 244,

Chapter 5
Explanation
296
higher-level theory, on the other hand, it receives confirmation only
from direct evidence—from the behavior of gases themselves.534
Formal models at different levels of abstraction thus receive confirmation
directly as well as indirectly, through their theoretical relationships with other
models.535
5.5.1.3 An Incremental and Creative account of Abstraction
Before I evaluate the utility of theoretical unification as an account of
theoretical explanation for biology, I will analyze a crucial point Friedman makes
vis-à-vis abstraction and how the abstract laws of physics do not only not lie, but
actually tell and construct much of the truth. For Friedman, abstract laws have
rich explanatory content. Perhaps his view stems from the idea that such laws
have context and assumptions – they borrow, and are intertwined with, other
very abstract areas of the theoretical world. In discussing the "analogous
relationship" between two specific pairs of laws in two domains, Newtonian
theory of motion and the kinetic theory of gases, he writes, in a passage that
serves as counterpoint to Cartwright's claims:
In both cases we start with a phenomenological law formulated in
terms of more or less observational quantities; relative
acceleration… [and] p, V, and T…. It turns out that this
phenomenological law is false536; no actual concrete reference frame is
                                                  
534 Friedman 1983, p. 244. See also Friedman 1981, p. 7: "For a theoretical structure
that plays a role in theoretical explanations in many diverse areas picks up
confirmation from all these areas."
535 For Friedman, but not for Cartwright, confirmation is "inherited upwards"
(pers. comm., September 2, 2003)
536 This contrasts starkly with Cartwright's claim that the abstract laws of physics
lie! For Friedman, phenomenological laws, in general, are false, in that they hold
under much fewer conditions and take into account fewer relations and
properties.

Chapter 5
Explanation
297
inertial; no actual gas is ideal. In both cases we can see just what is
missing from the point of view of a higher-level theory; Newtonian
theory tells us that we have to take account of B's absolute
acceleration and rotation… [and] kinetic theory tells us that we
have to take account of the sizes and interactions of the molecules
constituting our gas…. In both cases we correct an initial
phenomenological law by relating relatively observable entities to
higher-level theoretical entities: we correct [one formula] by
relating B to the Newtonian's unoccupied inertial trajectories [and]
we correct [the other formula] by relating our gas to the kinetic-
theorists unobservable molecules.537
Friedman's view here contrasts quite starkly with Cartwright's skepticism of the
veridical status of abstract physical laws. For Friedman, abstract laws provide
crucial information in the practice of theoretical explanation. Friedman has an
"incremental" view of abstraction as compared to Cartwright's "removal" view.
Here explanation (and abstraction!) occurs when a specific law/model is
embedded or subsumed under a more abstract law/model – this is subsumption
in the theoretical world rather than subsumption from concrete cases to the
theoretical world. Note that Cartwright is concerned with the former and
downplays the latter. Friedman's philosophical strategy and goals are the
opposite.
But even if we focus solely on theoretical explanation (which Cartwright
also discusses, as in the chapter entitled "The Truth Doesn't Explain Much" in
1983), we see that very different philosophical consequences follow from the
view of abstraction (e.g., law and model abstraction) as removal of properties or
Aristotelian causes (Cartwright's view) and abstraction as the filling in of
theoretical richness and texture (Friedman's views). For a follower of
Cartwright's view of abstraction, abstract laws of physics have relatively little
content and even in the domain of theoretical explanation, they can have
                                                  
537 Friedman 1983, p. 240, emphasis mine.

Chapter 5
Explanation
298
relatively little explanatory import; they certainly cannot, by themselves, be used
for derivations of lower-level (increasingly "phenomenological") laws –
assumptions about particular conditions must be added. For Friedman, abstract
laws have significant content: they allow us to "see just what is missing" in a
phenomenological law. They also provide their own "conditions of application,"
something a phenomenological model, according to Friedman, cannot do.538
One reason for their differing views is that, for Friedman, abstract laws are
individuated differently than for Cartwright. She only focuses on the statement
of the law itself, while Friedman may hold that all the theoretical assumptions
and context related to the law should be somehow considered "part of" the law –
the statement of the law is individuated together with this context to make the
"abstract law." But even with such an individuation, it still seems that a
Cartwrightian would emphasize the (theoretically) explanatory impotence of
abstract laws, whereas Friedman would claim explanatory power. For Cartwright
the abstract is depauperate, whereas for Friedman the abstract is rich.
This notion of the explanatory power of theoretical abstract laws is related to
the important idea of the creativity (rather than "mundanity"539) of abstraction.
Although, as we saw in Chapter 1, Cartwright's removal view does not imply a
mundanity view, her position on abstraction could easily lead an advocate to
underplay the creative (i.e., "tying together," "seeing new connections,"
"formulating new kinds of hypotheses") role that abstraction, and abstract laws

539 I.e., that abstraction does not do very much for us scientifically. Perhaps it
helps us to organize the world a bit, but the main "action" lies in empirical
research and in phenomenological laws.

299
and models play. This creative role, however, can be recognized quite easily
under Friedman's account. Furthermore, Friedman writes,
If [my] present treatment [of theoretical explanation] adds anything
to Whewell's notion of consilience it is perhaps the thought (itself
borrowed from Boyd and Putnam540) that the whole point of
theoretical structure is to facilitate this process of inductive "jumping
together."541
Abstraction, and model construction, provides the grounds for scientific
creativity.
One could make the further argument that abstraction, in its creative
aspect, is also tied to scientific understanding. Creativity and understanding,
then, would be related. But here some problems appear. Friedman provides
arguments for the relationship between unification and scientific understanding,
but once we bring in creativity and the role it plays for model derivation or
elaboration, the relationship is no longer so neat. Friedman assumes some sort of
epistemic Ockham's razor: fewer (but simplified?) assumptions, laws, and
models are supposed to give us more scientific understanding.542 This undercuts
the role of comparative analysis and the importance of diversity of (sometimes
competing) models and theoretical perspectives. As can be seen at least in
biology, there is tremendous creative strength in approaching the same problems
                                                  
540 Here I think that Friedman is not giving himself credit that he deserves.
541 Friedman 1983, p. 242.
542 Barnes 1992 and Humphreys 1993 consider the problem of equating
unification with understanding from points of view different from mine. Barnes
1992, in particular, provides a discussion of the issue of why derived
phenomena/statements should be considered less mysterious, or better-
understood, than underived "independent" phenomena. He argues that they can
only be considered less mysterious if one adopts a "local understanding" view,
that is, if one brings in causal explanation as well. I think that he underestimates
the power of derivation and the important independent role that theoretical
consistency plays in science, especially theoretical physics and, for some
theoretical activity in formal biology.

or objects from various points of view, both when the various theoretical
perspectives do not complement each other's analyses very much (as discussed
for the various areas of organismal biology in Chapter 2), and when they literally
are conjoined in an analysis of a complex phenomena543.
Furthermore, sometimes we may not want to reduce different kinds of
objects to fewer and more general kinds of objects – that may abstract away from
irreducible complexity and, in fact, obscure and destroy the creative process of
hypothesis formation regarding the causally-potent variety of complex objects in
biology (especially, compositional biology, with its complex abstraction, as
explored in Chapter 1). Thus, we cannot underestimate the importance of variety
and the creativity of comparison of various object types and theoretical
perspectives in biology. We cannot completely accept the relationship, implicit in
Friedman's work, between creativity and understanding/unification.544
However, we should also be wary of adopting a mundanity view of abstraction.
In compositional biology, creativity and diversity (not unification!) are linked!
                                                  
543 With regard to the second point, Kitcher 1976 provides the useful example of
explaining "why lightning flashes are followed by thunderclaps" as an example
of hybridizing two different theories (p. 210). Kitcher's article is intended to show
"why Friedman's theory goes wrong, and it [Kitcher's account of unification] may
point the way to something better." (p. 212) Below I will attempt to show that
Kitcher's account has weaknesses and that Friedman's account is closer to
scientific practice.
544 Frederick Schmitt made an interesting and related point: the relationship
between unification and explanation may not be one of identity, but may be one
in which unification "contributes to something else" related to explanation, such
as facilitating "comparison of competing alternatives." In this case, unification
may be finding of similarities across competing (or even mostly independent)
explanatory alternatives. So perhaps unification and diversity are not, as I argue,
opposed. This suggestion deserves further consideration. But, for the time being I
will hold that such unification seems to be very different from Friedman's
theoretical embedding relations. It would seem to have more in common with
Wimsatt's analysis of robustness across perspectives, a theme explored in the
context of compositional biology in Chapter 2.

5.5.2 Theoretical Explanation (Model Elaboration and Unification) and
Confirmation in Formal Biology
Let us now turn to the practice of how models are related to one another
in formal biology (i.e., theoretical explanation in formal biology). I have spent
considerable effort articulating Friedman's views because I believe that they can
be used to explain a rare, but important, case of relating models in formal
biology – model unification (a case of model merging). I will discuss the Price
Equation in this context as a paradigm example. But, most modeling in
mathematical evolutionary genetics, the paradigm case of formal biology, occurs
by elaborating models – that is, by developing models of ever-increasing levels of
specificity and complexity for increasingly realistic situations. For example,
much of population genetics consists in making ever-elaborate models with
increasing numbers of parameters and variables, which capture different forces
(e.g., genetic drift, natural selection, mutation) under particular organizations,
including population structure, and for particular assumptions. The primary
drive in mathematical evolutionary genetics is to diversify, not merge, the models.

Chapter 5
Explanation
302
In Appendix A, I describe model construction in formal biology quite
abstractly as (1) starting with certain equations ("input equations"), (2)
manipulating them in a theoretical way (i.e., mathematical in formal biology),
and then (3) formulating the equations that determine the behavior of allowable
values in the state space ("model equations" – laws of succession and
coexistence). But I left open what it meant to "manipulate" the input
equations—the laws—to form the model equations, which are the laws
emphasized by the semantic view. I also left open how the input equations were
chosen and which other entities were involved in model manipulation. In order
to provide even the sketchiest of accounts of model elaboration and unification in
formal biology, we have to address these issues.
Here I want to make a few distinctions important to my argument [see
Table 8. (5.2)]. There is a difference between model merging and model
diversification. The former is a matter of increasing levels of generality, whereas
the latter is a matter of decreasing levels of generality. The two are thus opposite
and complementary in direction of abstraction. Diversification can happen by
either adding parameters or variables of the same kind (e.g., adding more loci,
each with a particular fitness structure, including epistatic fitness effects) or of
different kinds (e.g., adding stochastic elements of genetic drift to a model that had
only included natural selection as a force). Merging happens in the opposite
direction by removing parameters or variables. This does not imply, however,
that the more general model has less theoretical content as one could claim by
focusing on Cartwright's account of abstraction – recall Friedman's "incremental"
account of abstraction (although for Friedman, incremental abstraction involves
adding parameters or variables).

Chapter 5
Explanation
303
There is now a further question as to how the concretization occurs. Is it a
matter of tight mathematical "deductive" derivation or is it a sort of "tinkering"545
elaboration? Note that these are both cases of diversification! This distinction is
indeed difficult to make in practice. Some model diversification in mathematical
evolutionary genetics has more of the sense of necessary and definitional
specification—a deduction, if you will—such as the relation between the Price
Equation and models of group, kin, soft, and hard selection.546 Here empirical
assumptions used to move from the former to each of the four latter are few and
explicit – the derivation is precise and mathematically tight. In many ways, this
can be described as theoretical embedding in Friedman's sense, although it is in the
opposite direction. Friedman's account of unification can be usefully and precisely
applied in this case, as I hope to show in future work with Wade. Moving from a
one-locus to a two-locus Hardy-Weinberg model is similar in terms of its
mathematical tightness.
                                                  
545 This word is not intended to carry perjorative normative weight. It is meant to
capture a style of modeling techniques as well as a kind of abstraction
relationship between models at different levels of generality.
546 Wade 1985 writes: "The models of soft selection, hard selection, kin selection,
and group selection can be represented as variations of a common general model
that expresses the total gene frequency change, itself a covariance, as the sum of
two covariance components: (1) the covariance within groups between
individual relative fitness and individual gene frequency averaged over all
groups; and (2) the covariance between group mean relative fitness and group
mean gene frequency." (p. 72) See also Frank 1997, who writes: "A general
framework is presented to unify diverse models of natural selection. This
framework is based on the Price Equation…" (p. 1712) and "The Price Equation
subsumes the particular results, by Fisher, Hamilton, Lande and Arnold, and
many others [including, presumably, Michod and Wade], and generalizes these
results to arbitrary systems of inheritance and selection." These are strong and
clear statements for the unifying role the Price Equation (or, more generally, a
covariance approach) plays. Both Wade and Frank support their claims with
rigorous mathematical models.

Chapter 5
Explanation
304
Other cases of model diversification have more of a sense of tinkering,
with multiple kinds of assumptions, empirical and mathematical alike, involved.
The model generated is extremely sensitive to the assumptions made, and
different investigators make very different kinds of assumptions. For example,
the very definitions of epistasis depend on whether one adopts the additive
definition of independence of quantitative genetics or the multiplicative
definition of independence of population genetics.547 The notion of epistasis is an
extremely complex one with multiple meanings and epistatic models are
diversified in many different ways.548 To some extent, the amount, and validity,
of derivation present in a particular case of model diversification can be
measured by the amount of conceptual debate surrounding that case. If the
derivation is clear (assuming that the assumptions are also accepted, which they
sometimes are), then there will be relatively little discord. The validity of the
Price Equation unification (opposite direction of derivation) is an example; this
equation is accepted as a valid, but perhaps not useful, rendition of selection. The
contention surrounding both the definition and prevalence of epistasis is an
indicator of the non-derivational status of these models and their sensitivity to
assumptions made.
The account of derivation (or, in the opposite direction, "unificatory
merging," or "unification" for short) vs. elaboration (or, in the opposite direction,
"tinkering merging") that I have sketched here549 [see Table 8. (5.2)] can be placed
                                                  
547 Wade et al. 2001.
548 See Wolf et al. 2001
549 Lloyd, pers. com. (July 28, 2003), has argued that most of the modeling activity
of population genetics is (non-deductive) elaboration. I agree with her. But I also
think that the (deductive) unification case of the Price Equation is an important
case of model-merging in formal biology precisely because of the theoretical

305
in the account of abstraction I developed in Chapter 1. Recall that I there
differentiated between the simple and complex abstraction of formal and
compositional biology, respectively. The "simple" mathematical abstraction of
formal biology—for which there is yet no good philosophical account, but for
which John Locke and C.I. Lewis provide good linguistic analogues—is used in
both unification and tinkering merging even if, in the latter there is much more
sensitivity to overall modeling assumptions, empirical and mathematical alike.
But when we look at the pattern of abstraction, it is in terms of removal of
parameters and variables in well-specified ways (even if the specified ways are
contingent on assumptions). Note also that because of the important background
role the assumptions play, the removal of parameters and variables need not be
equated with a removal (and mundanity) account of abstraction.
Thus far I have differentiated between the direction of model-construction
(i.e., concretization-diversification vs. abstraction-merging) and the mathematical
"tightness" of model-construction (deductive vs. tinkering). Now I want to make
the point that both derivation and elaboration of models is a theoretical activity
with some empirical content.
Much of the literature, however, claims that model diversification is
primarily analytical. Lloyd and other proponents of the semantic view
emphasize that models are "constructed, not discovered."550 Model construction
happens in an idealized theoretical domain and is then related to data models of
concrete systems, in an attempt to find empirical adequacy that will confirm the
                                                                                                                                                      
power of derivation. Friedman, pers. com. (July 9, 2003), has noted that he
believes that even in theoretical physics, unification is rare, even if it is a desired
outcome—a regulative ideal—among models at different levels of generality.

models. Lewontin argues that "population genetics begins with the undoubted
facts of Mendelism, of chromosomal recombination, of mutation, of inbreeding,
and builds a theoretical structure that is unassailable in its general outline."551
Sober states that
…when one tries to state an evolutionary law precisely, the result
seems always to be an a priori model in mathematical biology… [I]t
is time to investigate the possibility that biology has no empirical
laws of evolution because of the strategies of model building that
biologists have adopted.552
These strategies are presumably the a priori strategies employed in model
diversification. Friedman also concurs that model construction occur in the
"theoretical world" – this is precisely what he means by theoretical explanation.
While I agree that model diversification in formal biology is a
mathematical activity and occurs in a theoretical (sensu mathematical) domain, it
is not without empirical content. The laws, for example, are suffused with
empirical assumptions – for example (1) that parents have pairs of genes for each
locus and that these pairs are, in normal systems, segregated (for each locus) and
assorted with varying levels of linkage (across loci) and (2) that relative fitness
can be measured in terms of the relative numbers of offspring left by different
types of organisms of a species. Of course the laws, and concomitant models, are
represented and manipulated mathematically, but we cannot ignore the
                                                  
551 Lewontin 1985, p. 3. He further argues, as he did in 1974, that it is difficult, if
not impossible, to estimate the parameters that specify the magnitude of the
different forces of population genetics. Thus, multiple kinds of models can
sometimes produce the same empirical results. This lack of model confirmation
and truth-evaluation, does not detract from the mathematical theoretical
consistency of the models. Nor does it necessarily imply, as the semantic view
has proposed, that there is an in principle difference between applicability and
truth. In cases of multiple realizability of models to a particular empirical case we
know neither the applicability nor the truth of any particular model. Again, as
argued in Appendix A, applicability and truth are related!

empirical content that massively constrains them. Theoretical activity does not
imply absence of empirical content.
But, empirical activity is a separate matter and when the applicability,
empirical adequacy, truth-content, and causal explanatory power (four highly
related concepts) of the models are evaluated, we are concerned with confirming
the models. Here we have moved from model-diversification, a theoretical
activity, to model testing, which involves empirical activity. Lloyd provides a
good account of what is involved in establishing isomorphism, or near-
morphism553, between theoretical models and data models, (using also models of
the experiment, although she does not "distinguish between models of the theory
and models of the experiment"554).555 She claims that there are "three distinct
factors in the evaluation of the relation between the model and the data: fit
between model and data; independent testing of aspects of the model; and
variety of evidence… ."556
An open question here is at what level of abstraction the models have to
be in order to be tested. Phenomenological laws and models in physics, that are
directly tested, tend to be at a very concrete level. Lloyd appeals to Suppes'
hierarchy of models and notes that a model that is directly tested has to be "more
specified, more concrete than the abstract theory itself."557 This, then, is
                                                  
553 There are degrees of truth and applicability, that is, matching, between a
theoretical model and a data model.

556 Lloyd 1988, p. 145. Something like this kind of scheme can be used for
compositional biology, but there model manipulation is not purely a theoretical
activity (even in the non-mathematical sense of theoretical). It is difficult in
compositional biology to distinguish the activity of model-data fit from model
construction – the two are intimately related.

compatible with the case in physics. However, Lloyd also hints at degrees of
isomorphism in discussing models in which, according to her, only "the state
variables are empirically interpreted."558 The concept of "degrees of
isomorphism"559 implies that fairly abstract models can also be tested against
data models, to a limited extent. I will not here further adjudicate the level of
abstractness a model must have in order to be confirmed, either under Lloyd's
view or in the actual practice of mathematical evolutionary genetics. But I do
want to emphasize the difference in formal biology between diversifying (or
even merging) models, which is a theoretical activity (theoretical explanation is a
theoretical activity!), and model testing (or, as the semantic theorists prefer it,
theoretical hypothesis evaluation), which crucially involves, and is contingent
on, empirical activity. [This difference is also indicated in Figure 2. (5.1).]
Note that this whole discussion of the distinction between the
confirmation and explanatory relation, as well as the various distinctions
concerning model diversification and merging, hold specifically for formal
biology.560 I do not think that such neat separations can always be made in the
case of compositional biology. This is already discussed, for example, in
Griesemer's work on remnant models who does not accept an a priori distinction
                                                  
558 Lloyd 1988, p. 148.
559 "Degree of isomorphism" could mean either degree of actual similarity, or
degree of being able to even assess similarity in a particular respect (this will
depend on level of model concretization – a non-empirically concretized model
cannot, in some respects, be evaluated against empirical data). Here I use "degree
of isomorphism" in the latter sense.
560 Note also that theoretical content is required for empirical activity, such as
knowledge of how to set up an experiment or how to even interpret data and
make it useful for confirming a model or for deciding between models.

between "theoretical and observational activities."561 I will return to this point
below in the section on theoretical explanation in compositional biology.
In ending this section, I want to note that confirming models is indeed a
very difficult task in formal biology.562 In conversation, Lloyd has mentioned this.
Lewontin has also stated this in various ways.563 He has pointed out that
population genetics is not the "computational science" that it would ideally like
to be: give me as input the initial gene frequencies and the forces involved in
changing them, and my model will give, as output, the resulting gene
frequencies.564 The reason population genetics cannot do this is because it lacks
empirical information about the force parameters that would specify the
movements through state space. Rather, the task of empirical population genetics
is to estimate these parameters and to provide (different kinds of) models that
link (occasionally) known initial and final gene frequencies. As discussed above,
however, there are often multiple (kinds of) models that match the same data set,
thus confirmation is impossible given the lack of empirical information regarding
parameter settings of different evolutionary forces.
Thus, some have argued that the purpose of models in mathematical
evolutionary genetics (and even theoretical evolutionary ecology) is not so much
to provide "how actually" confirmable and confirmed explanations, but rather to
provide a host of other more open-ended types of explanation which cannot be
strictly confirmed. For example, Brandon contrasts "how-actually" with "how-
                                                  
561 Griesemer 1990, p. 3. I defended this distinction in Chapter 4 for many cases of
formal biology.
562 In compositional biology confirmation is deeply related to generating (or
theoretically explaining) a model.

possibly" explanations. Speculative "how-possibly" explanations "show[] how
known evolutionary mechanisms could produce known phenomena."565 This is
better than not having any account of how a particular character could have been
produced; of course, the problem is that often there are multiple (sometimes
conflicting) accounts among which we cannot decide due to lack of empirical
information – the models cannot be confirmed. Plutynski provides examples
showing that "mathematical and laboratory models function as plausibility
arguments, existence proofs, and refutations in the investigation of questions
about the pattern and process of evolutionary history."566 Although the former
two are cases of "how-possibly explanations" and the latter constrains the "how-
possibly explanation" options available, as Plutynski admits567, her analysis is a
contribution to our understanding of the broad role models play in population
genetics because she provides a taxonomy and articulation of "how-possibly
explanations" and she also ties together different kinds of models – mathematical
and material (in the laboratory). These models provide open-ended explanations
that cannot, strictly speaking, be confirmed.
In formal biology, model unification is a rare achievement, but is highly
respected and is an important form of model merging. Model elaboration
(diversification in a "tinkering" way) is a much more common form of model
generation – it is also very useful and realistic. Models produced in evolutionary
genetics are sometimes confirmed, but more often they simply provide grounds
for "how-possibly explanations." Admittedly, this kind of work in formal biology
is very far from an unificationist account of theory development.

5.6 Theoretical Explanation and Confirmation in Compositional Biology
Let me now turn to the role of theoretical explanation and confirmation in
compositional biology. This is an understudied area and here I can at best
provide a sketch of a full analysis. A complete analysis would require an
exploration of the relationships between (1) models, (2) modeling (model
articulation), and (3) theoretical and empirical (3a) activity and (3b) content in
compositional biology. Investigating these relationships would provide us with
information about how model evaluation (confirmation) and model application
(explanation) occurs in compositional biology. I will address a number of these
relations. First, I will evaluate one possible account of theoretical explanation for
compositional biology, Kitcher's version of theoretical unification. I will show
that for a variety of reasons, this version, though interesting, does not work.
After this, I will turn to particular examples from compositional biology to
provide some general lessons that can be gleaned regarding explanation and
confirmation in compositional biology.
5.6.1 A Syntactic Version of Theoretical Unification
Now that we have discussed theoretical explanation in formal biology at
some length (as model merging and diversification), let us turn to theoretical
explanation in compositional biology. Is there anything analogous to unification
or even (theoretically-motivated) model elaboration in compositional biology?
This is not an easy question, considering especially that theoretical activity in

Chapter 5
Explanation
312
compositional biology is closely related to empirical work. My argument is that
there are general (although not "unified") models in compositional biology that
guide empirical activity, but that the bulk of the model diversification work lies
in working out the causal details empirically and then representing them in
specific theoretical models. Thus, there is a constant feedback effect between
theoretical model explanation (i.e., diversification) and confirmation.
Furthermore, propositional and material models differ in their properties in this
case. In this way, then, although there are theoretical "resources" for model
diversification and causal explanation in compositional biology, there is
relatively little "pure" theoretical explanation (which is a theoretical activity).
Before I provide my view, however, I need to consider one last view on
theoretical unification in science, which could perhaps have been, but turns out
not to be, pertinent to compositional biology, Kitcher's account.
 Kitcher adopted Friedman's idea of the close relationship between
theoretical explanation and unification. He was critical of Friedman's exact
account already in 1976 where he claimed that his own sketch "enables us to see
why Friedman's theory goes wrong, and it may point the way to something
better."568 I will argue that Kitcher's account is the weaker one for a variety of
reasons569: (1) it is far from scientific practice, (2) it does not provide a sharp
account of unification, and (3) it does not provide us with precise conditions of
                                                  
568 See Kitcher 1976, p. 212.
569 Friedman's account of unification is, as we have seen, useful for a variety of
other reasons besides fleshing out the relationship between theoretical
explanation and unification, such as providing a counterpoint to Cartwright's
account of abstraction. I hope to have shown that a comparison of Friedman's
and Cartwright's respectively cogent and scientifically-honest positions on this
and other matters (e,g., modeling and the role and nature of laws), while
designed for problems in physics, are highly instructive for thinking about
biology, formal and compositional alike.

Explanation
313
application that would indicate to us how to actually employ it in particular cases.
Before I address these problems, I will provide an outline of Kitcher's sketch.
Succinctly put, Kitcher's thesis is that "a theory unifies our beliefs when it
provides one (or more generally, a few) pattern(s) of argument which can be
used in the derivation of a large number of sentences which we accept."570 Kitcher
thus needs, and has, an account of what "argument patterns" and what the
"sentences" are. Note that his focus is on these logical structures, rather than on
mathematical model structures of actual sciences, such as formal biology. Thus,
although as Lloyd has pointed out in conversation, his argument patterns can be
thought of as "model-types," they are formalized in syntactic rather than
semantic terms. An argument pattern is a particular reasoning "mold" that allows
us to represent a particular theory (say Newton's laws of motion, or Darwin's
theory of natural selection). This reasoning mold consists of sentences with (1)
logical operators and (2) non-logical dummy variables standing for observational
states. The highly abstract sentences of the argument pattern themselves stand in
a particular relation to one another (often in a sort of nested syllogistic structure).
The intra-, and inter-, sentential logical operations, when "filled in" with
particular conditions and observations for a particular case, provide the
explanations of that case – i.e., the observational sentences can be deductively
inferred from the argument pattern. And, according to Kitcher, a unified and
unifying argument pattern is one that allows us to derive a large number of
observational sentences. Kitcher calls the set of argument patterns the
"explanatory store" (abbreviated "E(K)") and the set of observational sentences,
                                                  
570 Kitcher 1991 (1981), p. 333.

Chapter 5
Explanation
314
that should be inferred (subsumed?) by this explanatory store, the "accepted
sentences" (abbreviated "K").571
Kitcher's account does have weaknesses. First of all, it will not seem to
work for formal biology since there the language of mathematics, as we have
seen in great detail, is employed rather than the language of logic. This is why a
semantic interpretation of theories works well for, say, mathematical
evolutionary genetics. One of the advances of the semantic view is that it
provided strong and cogent arguments for abandoning the logical formulations
of the logical positivists for mathematical expressions of actual science.572 But
perhaps Kitcher's view could work for compositional biology. Are non-
mathematical "logical" arguments not common there? Explanations, causal and
theoretical alike, are not formalized in axiomatic logic in compositional biology,
although non-mathematical models are prevalent. It is these models, not logical
argument patterns, that are ubiquitous in the explanatory activity of compositional
biology. Put differently, if we pay close attention to the scientific practice of
theory development in compositional biology, focusing on models and modeling
(tied closely to empirical activity) seems more useful than emphasizing logical
reconstruction.
Second, Kitcher's point is to claim that explanation is about unifying
explanatory resources. There certainly are prevalent explanatory resources in
compositional biology (such as basic assumptions about how mechanisms work,
or what genealogy is), but there is often debate about what terms and resources
should be employed in particular explanations (e.g., "homology"); this debate

572 See also Lloyd 1988, pp. 22-23 for her criticism of Kitcher's endorsement of the
Syntactic View.

stems from the different explanatory strategies employed by different theoretical
perspectives of compositional biology (e.g., comparative morphology,
physiology, and developmental biology in organismal biology). Thus, there is
little unification of explanatory resources, even narrative ones, in compositional
biology. Unification of explanatory patterns, whatever that exactly would mean,
is not a goal in compositional biology.
Furthemore, Kitcher's account of unification is vague. He claims that a
theory unifies our beliefs when it employs one or a few argument patterns. The
beliefs are presumably the observational sentences that we have come to accept.
The argument patterns are probably those that allow us to derive large numbers
of observational sentences, hopefully in a very unified way. So a theory unifies
our observational sentences by employing argument patterns that unify our
observational sentences. The question now arises as to how this unification
actually takes place. If it is simply the arbitrary union of many observational
sentences, then it is unclear how that happens. Perhaps it occurs by independent
derivability of sentences, but it is unclear how we would go about reconstructing
science in terms of logical derivability of sentences – this was precisely the failed
project of the positivists. Or perhaps Kitcher has some logically "weightier"
notion of unification in which argument patterns with more unifying power have
some intrinsically more robust logical properties. It is unclear what these would
be. Whether Kitcher defines unification in terms of achieving a union of many573
                                                  
573 How many? Unified in what way? Simply that they derive from the same
argument pattern? Then we have a circular definition of unification – sentences
are unified when they derive from the same pattern, an argument pattern unifies
when it derives many sentences.

Chapter 5
Explanation
316
observational sentences or in terms of the logical "strength(s)" of argument
patterns, or both, his account is, admittedly, vague.574
Kitcher's account is unclear both in terms of its central concepts and in
how philosophers should actually implement it in particular cases. An important
aspect of this problem is that it is unclear how we should actually individuate the
sentences and argument patterns to which he refers. There are many ways to
carve up the world into observational sentences and there are many, indeed
infinitely many, logically-equivalent argument patterns. One way in which the
semantic view solved this problem was by appealing to scientific practice, by
naturalizing the model interpretations in the actual practice of science and,
thereby, picking the valid from the invalid model interpretations (i.e., state space
interpretations and interpretations of laws). Kitcher cannot appeal to such a
solution because his analysis is not naturalized in scientific practice.
Unfortunately, other advocates of Kitcher's account have not succeeded in
specifying his views.575 For these problems, among others, Kitcher's syntactic
account of the role of unification in theoretical explanation, though interesting
and general, does not seem to work for either formal or compositional biology.
                                                  
574 In contrast, Friedman provides a clear account of unification in that (1) it is
tied to decreasing "cognitive burden" (an independent psychological notion) and
(2) it has a direct and clear relation to scientific practice (i.e., mathematical
modeling) and the actual implementation of unification in theoretical physics.
575 See, for example, Jones 1995, 1997; Skipper 1999. Skipper's account brings in
the notion of mechanism and "mechanism schema." Skipper accepts Kitcher's
program, while criticizing some aspects of it.

5.6.2 On Theoretical Explanation and Confirmation in Compositional
Biology
Now that I want to turn to whether theoretical explanation is at all
possible in compositional biology (whether it be in terms of unification or even in
terms of model diversification, as discussed above for formal biology). In order
to address this issue, I want to turn to examples of pairs of models (general and
specific) in each of two research areas the genomic regulatory systems described
by Davidson and the Krebs cycle.576 I deal here particularly with propositional
non-mathematical models. As we saw in Chapter 4, the status of remnant models
as clear cases of models is unclear.
I explained these two pairs of models in detail in Chapter 4. I discussed
how these four models satisfied the general properties of models I had inferred
from considering the semantic view, the mediating model view, Friedman's and
Cartwright's views on abstraction, and non-standard views regarding models,
such as that of Griesemer and Downes. Here I want to elaborate on how the two
models, general and specific, relate to one another. Can the specific model be
derived or, even elaborated, from the former in any way analogous to model
diversification in formal biology? That is, can theoretical explanation be used to
specify details of the more concrete model that are then tested against the
empirical world?
Davidson provides a general "cartoon" model as well as a specific model,
for the endo16 gene, of cis-regulatory systems. The cartoon model introduces
some general objects (e.g., adjacent cells, lineages, modular genetic regulatory
elements, basal transcription apparatus) and processes (e.g., spatial repression,
                                                  
576 Appendix Figures 4.4-4.7; 4.9, 4.10, respectively.

Chapter 5
Explanation
318
cell signaling, cell cycle) and notes how these objects and processes interrelate
and respond to one another. The cartoon model captures general aspects of
transcription regulation via structural DNA modular elements. It informs the
reader what kinds of objects and processes biologists look for when they
investigate the concrete causal processes of gene regulation. But the actual
research occurs not primarily by model manipulation, but rather by empirical
research activity in the laboratory. Model diversification occurs primarily by
empirical manipulation (which confirms the models and greatly biases their
further development).
For example, the details of the structure of the endo16 gene are discovered
by empirical research. A specific model of that gene is then produced, with 6
modules.577 However, this model is not derived or even elaborated from the more
general model. Certainly there are basic types of processes (e.g., spatial
repression or cell-cycle control) that apply here as theoretical resources [see
Figure 3. (5.2)], but the details of the extent, nature, and interaction among these
processes could not in any way have been inferred from the general model
without empirical research. That is, there are no theoretical manipulations that
could have produced the more specific model, as there are in formal biology.
Let us now consider the opposite direction of theoretical explanation,
model merging. Is there unification in any way here? I would venture to say that
although there is useful abstraction of concepts and terms in the models as we
generalize, there is no sense in which a useful unification of the actual models
occurs. That is, there is no way in which we can say that the most general model
(the cartoon model of Appendix Figure 4.4) somehow embeds the more specific

Explanation
319
model (of endo16 or whatever gene we are considering). There is no relation of
necessity or "enriched theoretical information," such as theoretical assumptions,
in the higher-level model. The cartoon model does not somehow contain, or refer
to, information that will allow us to derive the more specific models, as was the
case on Friedman's account of model embedding, and incremental and creative
abstraction in which the general model contained its own criteria of applicability.
Let us now turn to the pair of models of the Krebs cycle. Here the two are
really just different levels of resolution of presentation of a process that is already
known. In the case of Davidson's model the more general model both guides
empirical research and does, in a sense, include or describe, a whole host of
distinct specific models. In the Krebs cycle, however, the "general" model simply
depicts the number of carbons associated with the molecules present in it and the
energy-rich products of the cycle. The specific model shows every step in great
detail. But there is no difference in process-type referred to between the two
models. Perhaps the more general model has didactic advantages in showing a
beginning student the overall structure of the model, but it is not a more general
model in the sense that it unifies or embeds, in any way (actually or potentially)
the more specific model.
Having said this, the models of the Krebs cycle do depict, in different
ways, the causal capacities of the components to which they refer. The general
model provides a sense of the "flow" and general partitioning of the whole
processual system. The particular model indicates, complemented with textual
narrative, the causal capacities of specific components, though not the enzymes.
We have seen that one way in which unification in model merging fails to
happen in compositional biology is because the "theoretical world" does not

Chapter 5
Explanation
320
behave in a way analogous to formal biology. In part this is because it has less
structure, mathematical or otherwise, and does not exist independently as it
seems to do in formal biology.578 That is, modeling as a theoretical activity
independent of empirical activity almost never occurs in compositional biology
(recall, though, Corey's methodology in biochemistry), where constant reference
to the concrete part-organization of integrated and hierarchical systems is the
modus operandi. Another reason for the failure of unification in compositional
biology is that objects have many different causal capacities and there are many
kinds of objects (even different theoretical perspectives that individuate the
objects). It is not possible to usefully unify objects, properties, and relations of
different types under one (or a few kinds of) type(s)  – too much of the
qualitative uniqueness of the objects, properties, and relations (and capacities as
properties of objects) is lost. In formal biology, there are relatively few kinds of
objects, properties, and relations; there, unification of them is useful and—this is
a different point—precise and clear. Recall that the absence of useful unification is
one issue that I referred to when I stated that "complex" abstraction prevailed in
compositional biology.
There is, however, one, important case in which one model explains
another model: some of the hierarchies appealed to in compositional and
functional explanations arise from descent with modification. That is, the theory
of evolution, to an extent, explains biological hierarchy. Of course, there are
hierarchies that are not directly a product of lineages (e.g., while cells and
organisms are genealogical units, organs are not direct genealogical units), but
                                                  
578 Furthermore, it is also difficult to think about how material models would be
unified or embedded. What would unification of material entities be?

Chapter 5
Explanation
321
many hierarchies are. Furthermore, all biological hierarchies can be given an
evolutionary narrative (explanation?) at some level of removal. There is the
question of whether we here have a theoretical explanation: the theory of
evolution, in general, explaining the existence of biological hierarchies. To an
extent it seems that it is. But it certainly is not a unification or an embedding of
one theory into another in a clear theoretical space. It is a different kind of
theoretical relation: one theory explains, by explicit appeal to a material-historical
process, the existence of the phenomena of the other theory.
Let us now turn to the issue of model confirmation in compositional
biology. This is a difficult issue, and here I will only provide a sketch of it. Given
that theoretical model manipulation in compositional biology is intricately tied, in a
feedback process, to manipulation of concrete systems (which continually confirms, or
disconfirms, the models developed/diversified), propositional models are not
built completely and independently (like Diana from Zeus' head, or like most
models in formal biology) to be subsequently confirmed by concrete systems.
Models already contain the empirical information that allows them to "match"
the world. And they can be altered with epistemic impunity.579 That is, there is no
cost to changing representations, in an ad hoc fashion, in compositional biology.
Certainly this cannot be done in formal biology, where all sorts of theoretical
assumptions, including those regarding rules of mathematical manipulation,

regarding kinds of objects and processes also aid in the construction (and initial
lay-out) of the model, at various levels of meaning structures, informative

assumptions of the model and searching for new theoretically-consistent ways to
alter it.

presentations of how parts are structured and articulate processually are
constructed (i.e., theoretical explanation) based on knowledge, acquired
empirically, of causal mechanisms (i.e., confirmation through empirical
manipulation). The representations can be changed without much cost.
Independent theoretical model development, followed by empirical testing
(confirmation), is not the operative image of confirmation in compositional
biology.
But aspects of the models are developed, or at least postulated, abstractly
and subject to confirmation. For example, the robustness of the various
theoretical assumptions [e.g., the theoretical organization of the diverse kinds of
(structural and processual) parts abstracted in a particular science, such as
developmental biology], is subject to empirical verification and revision. For
example, consider how the discovery of Hox genes changed our theoretical
notions of what regulatory genes were and how they worked. Before the
discovery of those genes we certainly did have strong and independent
theoretical notions of gene regulation.580 But they were altered in the face of new
empirical information. Recall also Bramble and Wake's tetrapod feeding model.
Fifteen years after its initial articulation, the basic framework (i.e., the
periodization of the feeding process and the partitioning into the muscle groups
and head parts) is still used.581 This is a case where the theoretical assumptions
(i.e., the framing) of the model have been confirmed.
In general, model confirmation is not the same concern in a science where
the details of the theoretical models are unavoidably worked out empirically,

rather than mathematically. But aspects of the model, such as the assumptions
that go into the model-building are subject to confirmation.
5.7 Consequences of My Analysis: Two Different Pictures of Explanation and
Confirmation
Models clearly play an important role in both forms of biology. In their
roles as representational theoretical objects that serve as grounds for
explanations and for guiding further research, they are crucial in scientific
theorizing. As we saw in Chapter 4, the models of both formal and compositional
biology share the same general properties (although material models do not
perfectly fit a classic account of models). In both cases, for example, there is a
matching or "subsumption" relation between models and the world – that is the
definition of causal explanation. But the nature, extent, and emphasis on this
relation varies widely between the two types of biology. This relation is central to
formal biology, while it pales in light of a more central feature of the picture of
explanation favored by compositional biology. I will conclude this chapter by
summarizing, and presenting diagrammatically, the respective pictures of
explanation favored by each type of biology.
In formal biology, causal explanation occurs when a concrete case can be
shown to be subsumed under a law or shown to match a (law-based) model.
There are important similarities between the D-N model of explanation,

Chapter 5
Explanation
324
Cartwright's and, say, Salmon's causal accounts of explanation582. In all cases, a
law or model, expressed mathematically, is shown to pertain to a particular case
(whether it be in a subsumptive or a matching relation). Despite its deflationary
attitude to explanation, this "matching" picture of explanation is also central to
the semantic view on models. The (phenomenological) law or model at hand has
itself been articulated theoretically, by manipulation, from assumptions and
mathematical relations among simple properties. The important point is that the
models are interpreted as movements of "simple" mathematically-defined
properties of (simple) objects through state spaces. Cummins captured an
important and large subset of such theories in his notion of "transition theories."
The explanatory act lies in showing that the concrete situation is indeed a case of
that law or model – for, if so, then the theoretical structure (a bit of the
"theoretical world") involved in deriving the law or model has been shown to be
relevant to, account for, and "rule over," the particular case (a bit of the
"empirical world"). Despite an extraordinarily rich set of differences in the ways
of actually cashing out this picture of explanation, there is a basic common
pattern to it [See Figure 2. (5.1)].
In formal biology, theoretical explanation can occur in a variety of ways.
Most of the time there is a non-deductive diversification ("elaboration") of
models. Sometimes, however, a formal embedding and a theoretical unification
of models is possible (e.g., Price's Equation and various particular models of
natural selection); such cases are important theoretically in formal biology.
                                                  
582 This is not the place to explore Salmon's causal account, but he clearly believes
that there is an important relation between causes and laws. For example, he
notes that "Causal processes and causal interactions seem to be governed by
basic laws of nature…" (Salmon 1984, p. 179)

Chapter 5
Explanation
325
Whether diversification is deductive or not, theoretical explanation clearly
happens in formal biology in the form of theoretical mathematical model
diversification.
In compositional biology, models (that are not laws-based!) play a very
different role. They basically represent parts of hierarchical systems (a crucial
aspect of compositional biology) and summarize the causal capacities of parts.
Explanation does not (primarily) happen in showing how the model rules over
particular concrete systems. Although there is a "matching" relationship between
theoretical models and concrete systems, this relationship is much weaker and
less important in compositional biology as compared to formal biology in large
part because in the latter, but not the former, there is (1) much theoretical
manipulation and (2) there are theoretical constraints on the theoretical
manipulation. Models in compositional biology are highly flexible and
responsive to empirical discoveries – they can be changed with epistemic
impunity. There is no rigid theoretical structure, mathematical or otherwise, to
which they must conform.
In compositional biology, causal explanation happens when the
hierarchically-organized concrete parts with their respective capacities have been
captured in the appropriate way in the model. This happens after the interplay of
(limited) theoretical explanation (model articulation) and confirmation of
models. Although theoretical models mediate the explanatory act, the models are
developed primarily through the manipulation of concrete systems, rather than
of theory. That is not to say, however, that models do not guide research – they
do, but capturing the right causal structure is informed primarily by empirical
work, not in formulating the right theoretical models. Furthermore, the "right

Explanation
326
theoretical model" is one that accurately represents the structure and interactions
of the parts and their capacities [See Figure 3. (5.2)].
Explanation, both causal and theoretical, as well as the confirmation of the
models that perform such explanations, are central to both kinds of biology. The
structure of explanation, and the role confirmation plays, is very different in the
two, as I have argued, but in both formal and compositional biology, models and
modeling, which share general properties across the two kinds of biology, are
absolutely crucial.

Conclusion
In this dissertation I hope to have developed a philosophical framework
with which to analyze compositional biology. Abstraction, models and modeling,
explanation, and confirmation are so clearly different in compositional biology
that we require a new mode of expressing them in philosophy of science.
Furthermore, this new picture can then be employed to comprehend disciplines
in biology rarely studied and understood. I hope to have engaged in both
directions (i.e., science to philosophy and philosophy to science) in this
dissertation.
In my "Introduction" to this dissertation, I motivated and presented,
generally, my analysis and its conclusions. Throughout the dissertation, I have
also consistently reiterated the conclusions, at a finer level of detail. Thus, I do
not here want to restate my conclusions, but instead desire to point the way
toward new directions and questions.
I believe that it is important to analyze compositional biology from a
philosophy of biology vantage point, which I have not done fully in this
dissertation, due to space constraints. Philosophy of biology and philosophy of
science are concerned with distinct topics and my analysis of issues in the latter
did not explicitly address problems pertinent to the former. I will list three
outstanding issues highly pertinent to compositional biology and philosophy of
biology. First, it is important to understand how mechanisms and functions

Conclusion
330
interrelate. No systematic analysis of this relationship exists in the philosophy of
biology literature. Second, a more detailed exposition of hierarchy theory using
the distinction between formal and compositional biology would also be useful.
Hierarchies can be, and have been, presented, and analyzed, in a variety of ways
and I believe that my distinction and framework can give us purchase in
explicating, and categorizing, these various ways. Third, analyses of extremely
understudied theoretical perspectives in compositional biology, such as
physiology, functional morphology, and biochemistry would provide welcome
comparative studies to complement the current emphasis (in so far as attention is
devoted to compositional biology) on developmental biology and molecular
genetics. In the context of my distinction, then, there await a host of projects in
philosophy of biology.
There are also some outstanding deep problems regarding the
relationship between mathematics and concrete biological phenomena. First, we
need a rigorous and detailed account of mathematical abstraction, which I have
only hinted at here. Many unanswered questions remain. What must the world
(including our minds and social organization and social practices) be like in
order for us to be able to abstract mathematical properties from the objects
around us? What exactly have we captured when we find relations between
these (kinds of) properties? What is the hierarchical structure of mathematical
properties, and meaning structures built from such properties?
Second, we require a clear account of the relationship between two
theoretical structures—mathematical and "qualitative"—pertinent, respectively,
to formal and compositional biology. As in theoretical physics, mathematics
clearly provides the grounds for a rich theoretical structure in formal biology.

Conclusion
331
But I hope also to have shown that there is a large amount of theoretical structure
in compositional biology, captured in, for example, the compositional and
functional analysis (sensu Cummins) of a system. Furthermore, there is a clear
set of theoretical concepts and explanatory resources in compositional biology,
even if the theoretical structure is almost certainly less organized than a
mathematically-driven structure (and why should that be the case?).
Third, the different types of models and causal concepts in the two kinds
of biology indicate that there is elision inherent in the oft-asked question: "What is
the relationship between mathematical models and causal mechanisms?" First,
there are many kinds of models, or meaning structures, present in the theories
pertinent to formal and compositional biology. Second, what is considered a
cause, and what is deemed an appropriate presentation of a cause, varies
tremendously between (and even within) the two kinds of biology. Furthermore,
"mechanism" also has multiple meanings and instantiations in the two kinds of
biology. Hence, we cannot simply assume that models are mathematical, while
causes and mechanisms are concrete; the question above is too simple! We still
need a complete account of the various possible relationships between modeling
practices and the conceptualization of causes and mechanisms in biology.
Now that I have discussed the possibilities of future work (1) in
philosophy of biology and (2) topics surrounding mathematics, let me turn to an
"internal" problem concerning my framework. I have presented five distinctions
pertinent to the two kinds of biology (the fifth one is their different views on
explanation). There is a question concerning whether these are a priori criteria
that allow us to differentiate a particular science as either formal or
compositional, or whether we already have an idea of which sciences are formal

Conclusion
332
and which are compositional, and then from that we infer the properties that
sciences of a kind share. That is, do we use the criteria as a priori tools for judging
a biological discipline as compositional or formal, or do we already know what
kind of biology it is and, instead, abstract the criteria as properties of that
discipline as a prototype? Although my answer may not be satisfactory and
clearly requires further evaluation, it seems to me that both of these aspects are
important. In developing this dissertation, I have certainly employed both
epistemic directions (i.e., used the criteria in an a priori manner, as well as
abstracted them as properties from prototypes). This is consistent with my view
on science – in both science and philosophy, epistemology/philology/sociology
interact intimately and inseparably with ontology.
The last point for future work that I want to allude to here concerns issues
of relativism and disunity in science. Given these two forms of biology, we need
to examine the possible relationships between them. Are they unifiable? If they
are, then under which conditions are they unifiable? If they cannot be unified,
what does this tell us about the nature of scientific theorizing? If we can really
construct and define theories and theory-types that are irreducibly different, is
the cause to be found in our epistemic and social efforts, or in some sort of
ontological disunity, or both? And, in considering, more specifically, the varieties
of compositional biological sciences, what do we make of its different and
incommensurate perspectives existing side-by-side? What lessons regarding
realism and relativism s can we draw from this? Does variety give us strength
and robustness? Despite, or maybe precisely because, of variety in theory and
theorizing, can we still dream of an ontologically grounded grand unified
biological theory?

Appendix A: On Laws and the "Law-Model" Equivalence in Formal Biology
A.1 The Presence of Laws in Formal Biology
In an important set of criticisms against the logical positivists, proponents
of the semantic view of theories have argued against the notion of laws both in
science in general, and certainly in biology. In his important discussion on the
topic, van Fraassen argues against the views that laws (1) are universal in
temporal and spatial scope, (2) state what is necessary (and, perhaps, are
themselves necessary), (3) are required for explanations, (4) provide the grounds
for prediction and, therefore, through experimentation, are the theoretical units
that are (dis)confirmed in science, (5) hold counterfactually, (6) are objective.583 I
will not here rehearse van Fraassen's generally convincing arguments. It
certainly seems that the traditional conception of laws as held by metaphysicians
and epistemologists such as Armstrong, Dretske, Tooley and, more recently,
Leckey and Bigelow584 will not stand up to scrutiny. Such laws are also often
written in first-order logic rather than in the scientifically-honest language of
mathematics. Do these criticisms mean that we must abandon all desire and
expectations to find a scientifically useful and potent notion of law?
Other proponents of the semantic view, besides van Fraassen, certainly
think so. Let us look at a few other arguments against the notion of laws. Giere
argues that the relationship between the equations of any domain of science and

the world is "indirect" – it is mediated by an abstract system, a model.585 A model
in the semantic view, as we saw at the beginning of Chapter 4, provides for a
specification of a family of curves through a particular state space. Which model
then applies to the situation at hand is determined by the empirical facts. So,
Giere argues, models (and the equations from which they are constructed) are
not so much true or false, they are, rather, applicable or not to the particular
empirical situation.586 The theoretical hypothesis linking the model and the world
may be true or false, but the model is not, by itself, true or false.587
This may be a useful way of analyzing modeling, but I do not think that it
is a consistent argument against the role of laws in science. Let us first analyze
Giere's claim that the model is neither true nor false. There is a fine line between
breadth of applicability and the degrees of restriction of truth. Let us say that a
model turns out to have no, or next to no, applicability. Would that not, intuitively
at least, give us some sense that the model is "false"? Certainly on a pragmatic
definition of truth it does – a model that does no useful work in scientific theory,
including in theoretical or causal explanation, is false on a pragmatic evaluation.
But even on a correspondence definition of truth, the model seems to be false: it
simply fails to match any, or a significant number, of (data models of) real
systems and, thus, does not represent the world accurately. Under either criterion of
truth, then, an inapplicable (or very narrowly applicable) model is false. Note,
though, that a false model does not imply a meaningless model – a false model
still has empirical meaning, it is just that the meaning did not capture the right

data model structure.588 Thus, Giere's claim the irrelevance of truth evaluation of
models is problematic and, though I can see the point that it plays in his picture, I
shall not endorse his analysis.
My position, then, gives us the opportunity to directly compare the
model—including the assumptions, methods, and equations that went into
making it589—with the world (or, more precisely, a data model of the world). So
we can directly assess the veracity (in pragmatic or correspondence terms, or
both) of the claims that went into making the model. Now, it is clear, and Giere
admits this, that an important aspect of numerous models is the "equations,"
such as "Newton's equations of motion [not his] laws of motion."590 The issue
under investigation, then, is whether such equations can be usefully called laws.
We have already seen that the equations have empirical content that allows for
evaluation of their truth (utility or correspondence to nature/data models of
nature) – I argued against Giere's separation of applicability and truth. So the
equations can be, and are, (relatively) true or false, from the point of view of
causal explanation. As idealizations, we can only test the models constructed
from the equations against the world in terms of the limited state spaces used in
the models themselves. But these models can certainly match, or fail to match, to
different degrees, cases they purport to causally subsume or explain within
particular state spaces.
                                                  
588 Using Giere, Thompson 1989 argues that "the empirical meaning of a theory is
separate from the empirical application of a theory." (p. 72) This is true, but the
truth of a theory (in terms of correspondence or utility) is distinct from the
meaning and is related to the application, I would argue.
589 All of which Friedman would claim is part of the "theoretical world" and
which I claim is part of the dynamics occurring within the particular theoretical
perspective guiding research in that field.
590 Giere 1999, p. 91.

Appendix A
On Laws
336
Furthermore, from the point of view of theoretical explanation, an issue
that Giere does not discuss, the equations are "true" or "generative"— perhaps a
better word for Giere's deflationary attitude toward explanation—when they are
involved in generating a fairly abstract set of curves (in a state space with
relatively few variables) which can further specify a whole family of more specific
models with more elaborate state spaces (the same variables of the abstract
model in addition to distinct sets of possibly overlapping variables). Thus, the
"truth" of equations can be evaluated for both causal and theoretical explanation.
What we then have, under this view of both causal and theoretical
explanation in a state space approach, is a view of the equations as relatively
restricted to particular cases for which they are true (i.e., confirmed) – these
equations are precisely the phenomenological laws that Cartwright discusses and
from which phenomenological (sometimes considered "causal," at least in her
1983 book) models are built. The general equations that specify models that are
highly generative of further models are what Cartwright and Friedman both call
abstract laws. Equations can produce models, with laws of succession and
coexistence as model properties, that match or fail to match the empirical
domain.
The notion of "matching" is admittedly a difficult one. For Friedman,
model confirmation happens to models at all levels of generality; general models,
however, can only be tested with the few variables and parameters they include
and, thus, a variety of concrete situations would be consistent with the model
(although some might not be). Furthermore, he thinks that such confirmation is
cumulative. Cartwright emphasizes that only highly specific models are tested.
General models "lie" in so far as they do not allow us to match rich concrete

337
situations very easily to the model. As idealized models (with few parameters
and variables and all kinds of ceteris paribus conditions), they are basically useless
at matching and explaining reality or data models of reality. The locus (i.e., level
of generality) of model confirmation is one real difference between Cartwright
and Friedman. Note, though, that the notion that general models (and the laws
which underlie them) cannot match reality is not itself necessarily an argument
for the trade-off between explanatory power and generality – as Friedman points
out, general laws may have theoretical explanatory power and thus, indirectly
once they generate other more specific models, causal explanatory power (even if
you believe that explanation is causal subsumption of concrete situations).
What we should take away from this is that the equations that go into
constructing models can be directly evaluated in terms of truth content.
Furthermore, there are some equations that build models at various levels of
generality that actually cover a broad range of empirical cases, or that are also
highly generative of further models that turn out to match many empirical cases,
or both. These equations are true in many cases. They may not be universal in the
sense that there may be cases for which they should hold but for which they do
not (e.g., Mendel's laws of inheritance, although they are supposed to be "laws of
inheritance" certainly don't hold for all cases of inheritance – consider the single
bacterial chromosome). Furthermore, they may not be necessary – they may
themselves have evolved, as Beatty correctly claims that Mendel's laws did.591
And it is also difficult to assess their counterfactual explanatory power in fields
like biology with so many explanatory factors and background assumptions. Let
me now refine my question from above: does this mean that the equations whose
                                                  
591 Beatty 1980.

Appendix A

338
truth-value we use, and evaluate, through model building cannot be considered
laws?
In recent years there have been a number of philosophers who have made
cogent arguments in favor of the notion of considering these equations laws of at
least some sort. For example, Robert Brandon has argued that the "contingent
regularities of evolutionary biology have a limited range of nomic necessity and
a limited range of explanatory power even though they lack the unlimited
projectibility that has been seen by some as a hallmark of scientific laws."592 The
regularities of evolutionary biology serve more often in "how possibly"
explanations rather than the more precise "how actually" explanations.593 In the
former kind of explanation, explanatory weight and the necessity of laws in
deducing phenomena are fairly limited.
Concerning empirical generalizations in biology, Waters has made an
important distinction between distributions and causal regularities. Mendel's laws
or principles would be an example of the latter, whereas a listing of the taxa for
which these laws or principles actually pertain would be an example of the
former. Waters notes that causal regularities "exhibit many of the features
traditionally attributed to scientific laws."594
Sober has, with most force, argued that there are indeed laws, and causal
forces, in evolution.595 Recently he has argued that a priori modeling in
mathematical biology (e.g., the "definitional" status of Fisher's Fundamental

Theorem or the Price Equation) is what provides us with the laws of evolution.596
Thus, while only Sober endorses the usage of the term "law," these three authors
all argue for the importance of some derivate of the concept of law in
evolutionary biology.597
This too is what I hold. In order to count as scientifically useful and
desirable, (true) equations, or "laws," need not be necessary, universal, and have
full counterfactual-supporting weight. Admittedly the traditional metaphysical,
as well as the classical positivist, conception of law does have to be abandoned if
we want to understand, at least, biology, and possibly also physics (as van
Fraassen argues). But we would be throwing out the scientific baby with the
                                                  
596 Sober further claims that "…when one tries to state an evolutionary law
precisely, the result seems always to be an a priori model in mathematical
biology. Why has biology developed in this way, whereas physical processes
seem to obey laws that are empirical?" (Sober 1997, p. S467) I am not sure what to
make of Sober's argument. Certainly there are numerous cases in evolutionary
biology in addition to these, such as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle
or the definitions of inter-generational gene frequency change due to selection or
genetic drift, where mathematical definitions seem to play an important role in
theorizing and model-building. But Mendel's laws or principles seem to be
empirical generalizations. Furthermore, in some cases in physics, empirical
generalizations are the law-like content of the theory, such as the law of
universal gravitation which is an inverse-square law which could possibly have
been an inverse-linear or inverse-cube law. But what about Maxwell's equations
of electromagnetism or Einstein's time-dilation equation of special relativity?
They also seem to be almost mathematical definitions (derived, admittedly, using
some empirical content and assumptions – but that too is the case for all the
biological models which have definitional a priori status). How stark is the
difference between physical and biological (mathematical) model building here?
And how stark is the difference between a priori and empirical models, laws, and
generalizations? I am not sure.
597 See Weber 1999 for cogent arguments for the presence in ecology of
"evolutionary invariant generalizations which are law-like and at the same time
distinctively biological." (p. 91) He, together with the three authors just
discussed, are all arguing against Beatty 1995 who argues that all generalizations
in biology are either those of physics and chemistry or are contingent outcomes
of evolution lacking the universality and counterfactual-supporting power of
laws. As implied, I think that Beatty endorses too strict a notion of laws.

metaphysical bathwater if we gave up entirely on the concept of "law." We need a new
concept of law598, and we are on the way to developing one.
Thus far, I have shown how Giere's separation of applicability and truth
does not work and that we, therefore, can evaluate the veracity of laws
(equations), and the models that they are involved in producing, directly against
the world or data models of the world. There are different intuitions as to how
such matching would occur, including intuitions regarding at what levels of
generality it occurs, and whether we should focus on a confirmation relation or
an (causal or theoretical) explanatory relation, or both. But the point is that the
matching can occur, and is routinely done in (formal!) science, and it evaluates
the utility or correspondence, or both, of laws and law-based models and the
world. I have also provided further evidence, from the current philosophy of
biology literature, for the importance of ("tempered"599) laws in biological theory
and model-building.
There is another important set of reasons for maintaining a (revised)
concept of law in biology, which stems from my contrast between formal and
compositional biology. I believe that laws, in their mathematical and, often,
simplified, form that they exhibit, are a crucial aspect of formal biology, in direct analogy
to much of theoretical physics, and in direct contrast to compositional biology. Although
the mathematical biological laws of formal biology are restricted in scope,
necessity, and modality, they describe, allow for the modeling, and explain the
behavior of the simple objects of formal biology. An aspect of the simple
abstraction of that kind of biology, as explicated in Chapter 1, is also precisely

our conception of theoretical modeling.

that there are well-defined and clear methods of abstracting models and laws in
formal biology using necessary and sufficient abstraction (i.e., removing
parameters and variables one at a time, or varying specific, and mathematically-
defined precise assumptions). Such abstraction can happen precisely because the
mathematical methods of formal biology are well defined and allow for simple
functional (in the mathematical sense) relations between different (properties of)
kinds of objects. There are few kinds of objects and properties (and relations) in
formal biology. Furthermore, each kind of object and property (and relation)
pertains to many equivalent concrete cases.
Keeping a concept of "laws" is also important for causal and theoretical
explanation in formal biology. Causes can be precisely, neatly, and sufficiently
captured in the equations of formal biology. Causal explanation occurs, in this
kind of biology, as in physics, when the concrete system, or a data model thereof,
is subsumed under a law (or law-based model). As I argue below, causal subsumption
under law is analogous, even synonymous, for my purposes, to matching of data
model and theory model in the semantic view – in both cases a matching is done
and an explanation of empirical causes is produced. Another way to put the
point is that the semantic view is a good way to implement a law-based view of
scientific causal explanation – it is also closer to actual scientific practice. With
respect to theoretical explanation, models can be carefully and precisely
generated/derived (i.e., theoretical explanation) using these equations in a
cumulative and interactive fashion. The equations of formal biology play very
analogous roles to the equations of theoretical physics (and certainly in contrast
to the methodology of model-building in compositional biology). As long as we
are aware of, and avoid, the metaphysical burden, I do not think that it causes

Appendix A

342
philosophical damage to call such equations laws – at any rate, it reminds us of
their function in model and theory building. This is why Friedman's model of
theoretical unification is indeed pertinent to formal biology.
Laws play no role in compositional biology. In part this is because the
complex objects of that form of biology have very different and unique kinds of
causal capacities. The large number of distinct causal capacities of these complex
objects cannot be captured by mathematical simplification – their qualitative
variety is too "multidimensional." Furthermore, mathematical formalization is
not the appropriate strategy to capture the complex qualitative abstraction
pertinent to this form of biology.
Furthermore, the explanatory strategy in this kind of biology, as discussed
in the Cummins section above, is very different from causal subsumption. Here
compositional and functional analysis are crucial. Here the explanatory burden
lies in the unique causal capacities of different parts of a system rather than a law
or mathematical model that is matched to the data. This is not to deny that
models, of some form or other, play an explanatory role in analytical
explanation. It is just that the models are of a very different form and function
than the models of formal biology. The models of compositional biology capture
the hierarchical organization and the unique causal capacities of the parts of that
system.

A.2 The "Law-Model" Equivalence in Formal Biology
I have thus far remained vague about the relationship between models
and laws, mostly because I do not think that the difference is that significant with
respect to my argument. That is, the arguments about matching theoretical
structure to empirical structure, assessing truth, abstracting to different levels,
and the like are not significantly different between a model-picture and a law-
picture of theoretical structure. I fully realize that this is a highly contentious
statement. As I will argue below, though, a law-based view is not the same as the
"syntactic" or "received" approach to theory structure. I believe that a law-based
view, where the laws are written in the language of mathematics, the scientifically
actual formal language, rather than laws written in first-order logic with the
inclusion of only logical operators and "theoretical vocabulary," is a perfectly
reasonable way to describe theoretical structure in formal biology. I believe that
the failure to distinguish between these two senses of a law-based view has led
to much confusion in the literature and needless battering of the scientifically
useful and respectable concept of (formal mathematical) law. Furthermore, this
interpretation of a law-based view is perfectly compatible with the semantic view
and with the views of some "syntactically-oriented" thinkers such as Friedman.
By laws, as discussed above, I mean the equations that motivate the models
and which capture aspects of theoretical structure. These laws use variables that
specify the state space employed and the parameters determine the shape of the
curves through the state space. Now, the laws give the laws of succession,

Appendix A
On Laws
344
coexistence (and interaction, which are relatively rare in formal biology). In most
cases, the input laws (the equations) are manipulated and aggregated to form the
"model equations" that describe the motion of the curve through the space (laws
of succession)600. Some formalization, built from these model equations, of the
allowable combination of variable values, under the particular parameters under
consideration constitute the laws of coexistence. Hence there is a difference
between the input equations and the model equations, but the latter is derived
from the former together with various assumptions about the empirical system
and about mathematical methodology. Thus, it is clear that the model structure is
based on equations, or what could be called "laws."
Proponents of the semantic view happily use the (non-logical and non-
metaphysically-loaded) notions of laws I too am proposing, although they do not
make a distinction between input equations and model equations, which I think
is important to capture the modeling practice of (1) starting with certain
equations ("input equations"), (2) manipulating them, and then (3) forming the
equations that determine the behavior of allowable values in the state space
("model equations" – laws of succession and coexistence). For example, Suppe
argues that "The behaviors of physical systems are represented by various
configurations imposed on the phase space in accordance with the laws of the
theory."601 He then provides examples of deterministic and statistical laws of
succession, coexistence, and interaction. Lloyd concurs with, and uses, Suppe's
analysis.602 Thompson argues similarly by noting that "Physical laws, in this [the
semantic] analysis, serve to select the…[laws of coexistence, succession, and
                                                  
600 Note the clear analogy here to Cummins' formulation of "transition theories."

345
interaction]."603 He further notes, following Giere, that "laws do not describe the
behavior of objects in the world; they specify the nature and behavior of an
abstract system."604 Laws, as I have described them, are certainly involved in
model-specification. I differ with many proponents of the semantic view,
however, as we have seen, with respect to the nature of the "truth" of the models
and laws on which such models are based. Advocates of the semantic view claim
that the relationship is indirect and that models are never "falsified," they are just
shown to be inapplicable605; I claim that this is an unfair characterization of
science and of language. Models, and laws, are falsified when they are shown to
be inapplicable.606
An excellent example of a biologist capturing the relationship between
laws and models can be found in Lewontin's 1974 book. He writes,
[T]he problem of constructing an evolutionary theory is the
problem of constructing a state space that will be dynamically
sufficient, and a set of laws of transformation in that state space
that will transform all the state variables. It is not always
appreciated that the problem of theory building is a constant
interaction between constructing laws and finding an appropriate
                                                  
603 Thompson 1989, p. 81.
604 Thompson 1989, p. 72.
605 Lloyd does not seem to be completely consistent here. Lloyd 1988, pp. 21-22,
concurs with Giere's argument and notes that "This distinction [between theory
and theoretical hypothesis] will play an important role in our discussion of units
of selection." (p. 22) However, in her excellent discussion of the confirmation of
evolutionary models she notes three ways of confirming a model – i.e., of showing
isomorphisms between the theoretical models and data models [goodness of fit
between model and data; independent testing of aspects of the model; and
variety of evidence]. This seems to be an argument of the validity and truth
content (here I am not using truth in a strong realist sense – I bracket that issue)
of the model. Certainly her insightful discussion of confirmation implies that she
is evaluating the correspondence relation between the theoretical model and the
data model. This seems, on many accounts (even deflationary ones) of truth, to
be a concern with the truth of the model.
606 I take this to be the force behind, for example, Cartwright's idea (1983) of the
laws of physics "lying" (i.e, being false) and Wimsatt's idea (1987) of false models
as "means" to truer theories.

Appendix A
On Laws
346
set of descriptive state variables such that laws can be
constructed.607
Lewontin takes the constant shift between laws and descriptive state variables to
be an oscillation between theory and data. I do not think that this is necessarily
the correct way to interpret the construction of a state space, which, as advocates
of the semantic view point out, is itself a theoretical activity. It is interesting,
however, that Lewontin's explication, compatible with the semantic view in a
number of respects, immediately brings in the relationship between theory and
data, thereby undercutting some of the claims that model-construction is
completely ideal and a priori, and that applicability is a completely distinct notion
from truth evaluation.608 But what I primarily want to point out here is that, for
Lewontin, laws are clearly important and he even defines their "construction" as
a crucial, if not central, aspect of model-building.
Now, the notion of law I have been defending, and that the semantic view
and Lewontin also use, is explicitly differentiated from the logical positivist
notion of law, which is loaded with metaphysical baggage (cogently argued
against by van Fraassen) and written in the language of first-order logic. These
laws fall prey to a number of problems associated with the "received" view of
scientific theories: the (in fact, infinite) underspecification of models by any set of
laws, the inability to deal with unpleasant consequences of the arbitrary
conjunction of laws as well as with the problem of relevance, the apparent
explanatory symmetry of laws, the contentious distinction between observational
                                                  
607 Lewontin 1974, p. 8.
608 He does, however, claim that: "The delineation of the prohibited and the
possible is the function of population genetic theory. The revelation of the actual
is the task of population genetic experiments… ." (Lewontin 1985, p. 11) Again,
though, the actual is a subset of the possible and must be stated in the same
currency or metric. Model generation is not completely a priori.

and theoretical terms and entities [laws, for the positivists, were supposed to
contain only theoretical terms and logical operators], and the lack of fit between
these logical formalizations and how scientists actually represent theoretical
knowledge in their day-to-day theoretical activity. These problems arise as a
consequence of the "laws" being written in first-order logic and being interpreted
as directly related to the causal properties of concrete systems. As I hope to have
shown, laws are related through models to the world, and first-order logic
together with an advocacy of a strong distinction between observational and
theoretical terms is invalid.
