History
From Wikipedia:
The proof is attributed to Pythagoras of Samos, c. 570 c. 495 BC - an Ionian
Greek philosopher and mathematician. He is often revered as a great mathemati-
cian and scientist and is best known for the Pythagorean theorem which bears his
name.
According to historians of mathematics, Pythagorean theorem was well-known to
the mathematicians of the First Babylonian Dynasty (20th to 16th centuries BC),
which would have been over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born.

Application
Pythagorean theorem is very important in mathematics, and all other hard sci-
ences, and technology.
Possibly the most important application is that it gives a simple formula for dis-
tance between two points in Cartesian coordinates.
If point A has coordinates (xA, yA), and point B has coordinates (xB, yB), then
the distance between them is
AB =
p
(xA −xB)2 + (yA −yB)2

Application
Similar formula holds in 3 dimensions:
If point A has coordinates (xA, yA, zA), and point B has coordinates (xB, yB, zB),
then the distance between them is
AB =
p
(xA −xB)2 + (yA −yB)2 + (zA −zB)2
Similarly for complex numbers, the absolute value of z = x + iy is
|z| =
p
x2 + y2,
which is the distance from origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y).
