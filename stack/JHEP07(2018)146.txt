Abstract: We study excitations of LLM geometries. These geometries arise from the
backreaction of a condensate of giant gravitons. Excitations of the condensed branes are
open strings, which give rise to an emergent Yang-Mills theory at low energy. We study
the dynamics of the planar limit of these emergent gauge theories, accumulating evidence
that they are planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills. There are three observations supporting
this conclusion: (i) we argue for an isomorphism between the planar Hilbert space of the
original N = 4 super Yang-Mills and the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge
theory, (ii) we argue that the OPE coeﬃcients of the planar limit of the emergent gauge
theory vanish and (iii) we argue that the planar spectrum of anomalous dimensions of the
emergent gauge theory is that of planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills. Despite the fact that the
planar limit of the emergent gauge theory is planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills, we explain
why the emergent gauge theory is not N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory.

Introduction
The map between the planar limit of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory and an integrable
spin chain [1] has been a surprisingly rich idea. Single trace operators in the conformal
ﬁeld theory (CFT) are identiﬁed with states of the spin chain, and the dilatation operator
of the CFT with the Hamiltonian of the spin chain. This allows the exact computation of
anomalous dimensions and hence precision tests [2, 3] of the duality with string theory on
AdS5×S5 [4–6]. Excitations of the closed string are identiﬁed as magnons. The magnons
are visible in the dual string theory description [7, 8]. After projecting the closed string
solution to a plane (the so called bubbling plane [9]) and using coordinates suited to 1/2
BPS supergravity geometries, the string worldsheet traces out a polygon [8]. The sides
of the polygon are the magnons. Geometrical properties of these sides (their length and
orientation) determine the conserved charges (momentum and energy) labeling the magnon.
The S-matrix for magnon scattering is determined up to a single overall phase simply by
kinematics [10]. Integrability then ﬁxes this phase. The S-matrix computed in string theory
is in exact agreement with the S-matrix computed in the CFT.

How much, if anything, of this story survives for string excitations of new geometries?
The geometries that we have in mind are the LLM geometries [9]. An LLM geometry is
dual to an operator with a dimension that grows as N2 in the large N limit. Consequently,
correlators of operators with dimensions of order N2 encode the physics of excitations of
these geometries. For operators with such a large dimension the planar approximation is
not justiﬁed [11]. Consequently, mixing between diﬀerent trace structures is not suppressed.
The identiﬁcation between single trace operators in the CFT and spin chain states is spoiled
and it seems that the link to an integrable spin chain is lost. In this introduction we will
give some physical arguments which suggest that, at least for a subset of excitations, this
is not the case. The rest of the paper then carries out detailed CFT computations that
conﬁrm the details of this physical picture.
The LLM geometries are dual to a 1/2 BPS sector of the CFT. This 1/2 BPS sector
contains all gauge invariant operators built from a single complex matrix Z. Since we study
single matrix dynamics, there is a simple free fermion description, obtained by working in
terms of the eigenvalues of Z [12, 13]. There is also a closely related description which
employs Schur polynomials in Z [13, 14]. We mainly use this second description as we
know how to generalize it when including more matrices [15, 16]. This is needed when
studying small ﬂuctuations of the LLM geometries. A Schur polynomial dual to an LLM
geometry is labeled by a Young diagram with order N2 boxes [9]. An operator dual to a
smooth supergravity geometry has a Young diagram with O(1) corners and the distance
between any two adjacent corners (that is, the number of rows or columns ending on the
side between the two corners) is order N. The string theory understanding of this geometry
is that it is the state obtained from back reaction of condensed giant gravitons [17–19]. The
translation between the CFT and string theory descriptions is direct: we read the rows of
the Young diagram as dual giant gravitons or the columns as giant gravitons [13].
To excite the geometry in the CFT description, add boxes at a particular corner of
the Young diagram describing the LLM geometry [20–22]. In string theory we understand
this as exciting the giants that condensed to produce the geometry. The description of
worldvolume excitations of these D3 brane giant gravitons is in terms of some open string
ﬁeld theory whose low energy limit gives rise to a new emergent Yang-Mills theory [23,
24]. Relative to the original Yang-Mills theory we started with, the space of the giant’s
worldvolume is an emergent space. The new emergent Yang-Mills theory may itself have
a holographic description so we might have new holographic dualities in this large charge
limit [23].
The intuitive picture sketched above suggests that excitations arising from any partic-
ular corner give rise to a distinct super Yang-Mills theory. We will study the planar limit
of these emergent gauge theories, to provide detailed support for this intuition. To restrict
to the planar limit consider excitations with a bare dimension of at most O(
√
N), i.e. add
at most O(
√
N) boxes to any given corner. Concretely we will demonstrate three things
1. An isomorphism between the planar Hilbert space of the original N = 4 super Yang-
Mills theory and the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory arising at
a corner. When restricted to the 1/2 BPS sector, these Hilbert spaces are in fact a
generalization of the code subspaces constructed by [25] (see also [26–28]).

2. Three point functions of operators in the planar emergent gauge theory vanish. We
demonstrate this in the free ﬁeld theory. In the planar limit of matrix models the
vanishing follows because to mix three single traces we have to break some index
loops which costs (at least) a factor of N. This is a general conclusion true for both
free and interacting matrix models. Consequently we conjecture that our free ﬁeld
theory result holds after interactions are turned on. Since operator product expansion
(OPE) coeﬃcients can be read from the three point functions, this implies the OPE
coeﬃcients of the planar emergent gauge theory vanish.
3. The correct spectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the emergent gauge theory.
We know the planar spectrum of anomalous dimensions of N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory. We ﬁnd the same spectrum for the emergent gauge theory. This demonstrates
integrability for the emergent gauge theories.
Notice that since any CFT is determined by its spectrum of anomalous dimensions
and OPE coeﬃcients, and that in the strict planar limit all OPE coeﬃcients vanish, this
demonstrates that the planar limit of the emergent gauge theories are planar N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory. We will see that although these diﬀerent emergent gauge theories all
share the same coupling constant (which is expected since this coupling is equal to the
string coupling constant of the original string theory on AdS5×S5), they generically have
distinct gauge groups U(Neﬀ). The rank of the gauge group Neﬀreceives contributions
both from the ﬂux of the original N D3 branes that gives rise to the N = 4 super Yang-
Mills theory we start with and from the giants which have condensed. By considering a
large charge state, its possible to have an emergent gauge theory with gauge group that
has rank larger than N.
What we are ﬁnding is that a subset of the excitations of large charge states of the N =
4 super Yang-Mills theory are equivalent to excitations of the vacuum. There are of course
excitations that go beyond the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. The excitation
is constructed by adding boxes to the Young diagram describing the LLM geometry. We
might add so many boxes that we reach beyond two corners of the Young diagram deﬁning
the LLM geometry.
The excitation is “too big” to sit on the Young diagram and in
this way we can detect features of the background Young diagram. These excitations are
obtained by adding ∼N boxes and hence do not belong to the planar limit of the emergent
gauge theory - they are giant graviton like operators of the emergent theory. There are
also excitations constructed by adding order
√
N boxes, with the boxes added at diﬀerent
corners [21, 22, 45]. These (delocalized) states can be described as strings with magnon
excitations that stretch between two corners. We will show that at large N these states are
decoupled from (localized) states in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory,
so that if we start from a state in the planar Hilbert space, the large N dynamics will not
take us out of this space. This is an important point to demonstrate since the coupling
of the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory to other degrees of freedom will
almost certainly ruin integrability.
The free fermion description of the system is a powerful description because of its
simplicity. The large charge state corresponds to exciting the fermions as illustrated in

Figure 1. The free fermion description of a state labeled by a Young diagram. On the left we have
the Fermi sea corresponding to the AdS5×S5 geometry. The states are simply ﬁlled from the lowest
to highest energy with no unoccupied states. On the right, the Young diagram corresponding to a
particular LLM geometry is shown. Each vertical edge of the Young diagram maps into occupied
states while the horizontal edges map into unoccupied states. The number of fermions that were
not excited at all is equal to the number of rows with no boxes. Thus, the excited state has broken
the Fermi sea up into a series of occupied blocks.
ﬁgure 1. The idea that a subset of the excitations of large charge states of the CFT are
equivalent to excitations of the vacuum has a natural interpretation in this free fermion
language. We are saying that exciting any edge of the blocks appearing in the excited state
is equivalent to exciting the edge of the original Fermi sea. The only diﬀerence between the
diﬀerent blocks is their extent. By restricting to the planar limit we consider excitations
that are not able to detect that the Fermi sea is not inﬁnite, so the extent of each block
is irrelevant.
We will be using group representation theory methods to approach the problem of
computing correlators of operators with a bare dimension of order N2. This approach has
been developed in a series of articles [13, 15, 16, 29–38], which has developed a number of
bases for the local operators of the theory. These bases diagonalize the two point function
of the free theory to all orders in 1/N, and they mix weakly at weak coupling [30, 39, 40].
They therefore provide a very convenient tool with which to tackle the large N but non-
planar limit of the CFT.
The representation theory methods sum the complete set of ribbon graphs. In this
approach, operators are constructed using projection operators1 of the symmetric group so
that the gauge invariant operators are labeled with irreducible representations of the group.
Summing the ribbon diagrams of the free theory becomes multiplying these projectors and
1These operators are actually intertwiners since they map between diﬀerent copies of the representations
involved. For simplicity though the reader may think of them as projectors which are more familiar.

then taking a trace. At loop level, we evaluate the dilatation operator D. Evaluating matrix
elements of D amounts to computing the trace of the product of commutators of elements
of the symmetric group with projection operators. The central technical achievement is
that in the end computing correlators, i.e. summing the ribbon graphs, is reduced to
well deﬁned (but technically involved) problems in group representation theory. A helpful
point of view in making sense of the details, which we introduce and develop in this article,
entails classifying the various ingredients of the computation as background independent or
background dependent. By something that is background independent, we mean something
that would take the same value on any inward pointing corner of any Young diagram dual
to an LLM geometry, or even in the absence of a background, i.e. in the planar limit
of the original CFT. These are quantities that take the same value regardless of which
collection of branes we excite, and this is what we signify in the terminology “background
independent”. A quantity that is background dependent does depend on the collection
of branes we excite. As we discuss in section 2, after making this distinction it is clear
that the Hilbert spaces of the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory at any corner are
isomorphic to each other and to the planar Hilbert space of the theory in the absence of
a background.
One of the original motivations for this study are the results [21, 22, 41] which suggest
the existence of new integrable subsectors of the CFT. We want to explore (and further
establish) the existence of these integrable subsectors. As discussed above, a key issue is
to understand if the integrable sectors are decoupled from the nonintegrable sectors. It is
useful to bear in mind that integrability in the planar limit also depends on a decoupling be-
tween diﬀerent subspaces: it makes use of the fact that diﬀerent trace structures don’t mix.
Thanks to this decoupling, it is consistent to focus on the space of single trace operators
and it is in this subspace that its possible to construct a bijection between operators and
the states of an integrable spin chain. The statement of this decoupling is coded into the
planar correlation functions: correlators of operators with diﬀerent trace structures vanish
as N →∞. Motivated with this insight we focus on correlation functions of the large N
but non-planar limits to establish the decoupling between integrable and non-integrable
subsectors. This is discussed in section 2, where we obtain a simple formula for the corre-
lators in the planar limit of the free emergent gauge theory in terms of correlators of the
free planar CFT without background. Consequently the decoupling we establish is closely
related to the absence of mixing between diﬀerent trace structures in the planar limit.
We extend these results to the weakly interacting CFT in section 3, giving arguments
that the spectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the emergent gauge theory match the
spectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the original N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory.
We revisit the issue of coupling between integrable and non-integrable subsectors, arriving
at the conclusion that the two are decoupled even after interactions are turned on.
In section 4 we consider the strongly coupled CFT, using the dual string description.
We explain why the excitations considered should be understood as open string excitations
localized on the world volume of giant graviton branes. We also suggest how to describe
closed string excitations of the large charge state we consider. In section 5 we summarize
and discuss a number of promising directions in which to extend this work.

Free CFT
Our basic goal is to organize and study excitations of an LLM background, using the
dual N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory.
Any LLM geometry is speciﬁed by a boundary
condition, given by coloring the bubbling plane into black and white regions [9]. The LLM
backgrounds we consider have boundary conditions given by concentric annuli, possibly
with a central black disk. The LLM geometry is described by a CFT operator with a
bare dimension of order N2. Concretely, it is a Schur polynomial [13] labeled by a Young
diagram with O(N2) boxes and O(1) corners. Large N correlators of these operators are not
captured by summing only planar diagrams, so we talk about the large N but non-planar
limit of the theory. The excitation is described by adding J boxes to the background, with
J2 ≪N. Consequently, we can ignore back reaction of the excitation on the LLM geometry.
The CFT operators corresponding to the background and excitation are given by
restricted Schur polynomials [15, 16]. Construction of these operators and their correlators
becomes an exercise in group representation theory. In section 2.1 we discuss elements of
this description, placing an emphasis on if the quantity being considered depends on or is
independent of the collection of branes being excited. This distinction will clarify general
patterns in the CFT computations that follow.
We begin our study in the free ﬁeld theory.
The Hilbert space of possible excita-
tions can be written as a direct sum of subspaces. There are subspaces that collect the
excitations localized at the outer or inner edge of a given annulus, or at the outer edge
of the central disk. The excitations are obtained by adding boxes to the Young diagram
describing the background, at a speciﬁc location. They are also localized in the dual grav-
itational description, at a speciﬁc radius on the bubbling plane [21, 22]. Each localized
Hilbert space is labeled by the edge at which it is localized. There are also delocalized
excitations, where the description of the excitation involves adding boxes at diﬀerent lo-
cations on the background Young diagram [21, 22]. We will not have much to say about
delocalized excitations.
The excitations belonging to the localized Hilbert spaces play a central role in our
study. These are the Hilbert spaces of the emergent gauge theories. We give a bijection
between the states belonging to the planar Hilbert space of an emergent gauge theory, and
the states of the planar limit of the original CFT without background. To show that the
bijection takes on a physical meaning, we argue that correlation functions of operators that
are in bijection are related in a particularly simple way, in the large N limit. This result
is signiﬁcant because the basic observables of any quantum ﬁeld theory are its correlation
functions and many properties of the theory can be phrased as statements about correlation
functions.
Thanks to the map between correlation functions, any statement about the
planar limit that can be phrased in terms of correlators, immediately becomes a statement
about the planar emergent gauge theories that arise in the large N but non-planar limits
we consider.
2.1
Background dependence
Irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn are labeled by Young diagrams with
n boxes. States in the carrier space of the representation are labeled by standard tableau,
– 6 –

in which we populate the boxes with numbers {1, 2, . . . , n} such that the numbers are
decreasing along the rows (from left to right) and along the columns (from top to bottom).
A representation for Sn is given by specifying the action of any element σ ∈Sn on the
standard tableau. We will use Young’s orthogonal representation. For example, here is the
action of the two cycle σ = (12) ∈S4 on a speciﬁc tableau

the relative position of boxes 1 and 2. Consequently, σ has the same action on all three
states shown below.

This demonstrates that the action of the symmetric group on the boxes belonging to the
excitation is background independent. In what follows we will use R (or r) to denote the
Young diagram describing the excitation and +R (or +r) to denote the Young diagram after
it has been placed at an inward pointing corner of the Young diagram for the LLM geometry.
When our excitation has more than one type of ﬁeld, the gauge invariant operator is
constructed by restricting to the subgroup that permutes ﬁelds of a speciﬁc type. For exam-
ple, if we have n Z ﬁelds and m Y ﬁelds, we would start with an irreducible representation
R ⊢n + m of Sn+m and restrict to some representation (r, s), r ⊢n, s ⊢m, of the Sn × Sm
subgroup. Upon restricting (r, s) may appear more than once, so we need a multiplicity
label α to distinguish the diﬀerent copies. Since we use only the action of the symmetric
group to perform the restrictions, the multiplicity labels are also background independent.
To diagonalize the one loop dilatation operator [42, 43] traded the multiplicity labels for
directed graphs recording how open strings are connected between giant gravitons. These
graphs summarize basic physics coming from the Gauss Law on the brane worldvolume
– 7 –

JHEP07(2018)146
that is true for any collection of compact branes. This is why the multiplicity labels are
background independent.
There is a potential ﬂy in the ointment that deserves discussion. In the absence of the
background, R is used to put the Zs and Y s together while r is used to organize the Zs
and s the Y s. In the presence of the background, constructed using Zs, we must replace
R →+R and r →+r, while s is unchanged. The ﬁrst m boxes labeled in the standard
tableau made by ﬁlling R are Y ﬁelds, and are among the impurity boxes added to the
background Young diagram. The remaining boxes are then labeled in all possible ways
to give the states of the subspace. Imagine that n = m = 2. Two possible labeling are
as follows
4 3 1
2
4
3 1

(2.4)
On the left we have the usual action of the symmetric group on the added boxes. For the
state on the right, we ﬁnd a diﬀerent answer. At large N, when the number of boxes in
the shortest path linking distant box 4 to any local labeled box (where the excitation was
added) is of order N, any permutation swapping box 4 with another box, will just swap the
two labels. This is orthogonal to the state before the swap. We will always land up taking
a trace over group elements of the subgroup that permutes excitation boxes. For the traces
we need only states on the left contribute. As a consequence, although the action of the
symmetric group on impurities is not background independent traces over these elements
are.2 Notice that the problem of resolving multiplicities is phrased entirely in terms of the
subgroup acting on Y ﬁelds i.e. we can set the problem up so that the multiplicities are
associated to representation s. For this reason the above potential spanner in the works
doesn’t threaten our conclusion that multiplicity labels are background independent.
The operators which generalize the Schur polynomials when more than one type of
ﬁeld is present are called restricted Schur polynomials [15, 29]. The Schur polynomial is
constructed using characters of the symmetric group. The restricted Schur polynomial is
constructed using a restricted character χR,(r,s),αβ(σ) [29]. Recall that the character χR(σ)
is given as a trace over the matrix ΓR(σ) representing σ in irreducible representation R. For
the restricted character we restrict the trace to the subspace carrying the representation of
the subgroup (r, s). Because there are diﬀerent copies of (r, s) in the game, there are many
ways to do this. The restricted character χR,(r,s)αβ(σ) is given by summing the row index
of ΓR(σ) over the α copy of (r, s) and the column label over the β copy of (r, s). This can
be accomplished by making use of an intertwining map PR,(r,s)αβ which maps from the α
copy of (r, s) to the β copy of (r, s). This map can be constructed using only elements of
2This is of course up to a factor which is determined by the dimension of the irreducible representation
of the background. This factor is from summing over all the possible standard tableau obtained by ﬁlling
boxes associated to the background.

the symmetric group that act on the impurities. In terms of PR,(r,s)αβ we have
χR,(r,s)αβ(σ) = Tr
 PR,(r,s)αβ ΓR(σ)

(2.5)
In the presence of the background this becomes
χ+R,(+r,s)αβ(σ) = Tr
 P+R,(+r,s)αβ Γ+R(σ)

(2.6)
where σ is the same permutation as in (2.5). It is clear that the restricted character is
background independent, up to the remark of footnote 2.
The operators of the planar limit are dual to strings and gravitons in the AdS5×S5
geometry. Since the restricted Schur polynomials provide a basis, any such operator can
be expressed as a linear combination of restricted Schurs. For simplicity we will discuss
operators constructed from two complex matrices Z and Y , but it will be clear that our
conclusions generalize for an arbitrary local operator. The deﬁnition of the restricted Schur
polynomial is [15]
χR,(r,s)αβ(Z, Y ) =

χR,(r,s),αβ(σ)Y i1
iσ(1) · · · Y im
iσ(m)Zim+1
iσ(m+1) · · · Zin+m
iσ(n+m) .
(2.7)
An arbitrary operator OA can be expanded in the basis of restricted Schur polynomials as
follows [16]
OA =
X
R,r,s,α,β
a(A)
R,(r,s),α,βχR,(r,s)αβ(Z, Y, X, · · · )
(2.8)
We will argue that the expansion coeﬃcients a(A)
R,(r,s),α,β are background independent. Imag-
ine that OA is the operator in the planar Hilbert space corresponding to some speciﬁc state,
labeled by its dimension, R-charge and whatever other labels we need to specify it com-
pletely. The operator in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory, dual to
the state that shares the same labels, is given by
O+A =
X
R,r,s,α,β
a(A)
R,(r,s),α,βχ+R,(+r,s)αβ(Z, Y, X, · · · )
(2.9)
It is in this sense that the expansion coeﬃcients are background independent. We will
argue for (2.9) below by demonstrating that with this rule the correlation functions of
the set of operators {O+A} are given in terms of those of {OA}, essentially by replacing
N →Neﬀ. The two operators should then represent the same physical state since the
physical interpretation of any operator is coded into its correlation functions.
We now consider quantities that are background dependent. The two point function
of restricted Schur polynomials includes a product of the factors of the Young diagram. A
box in row i and column j of a Young diagram has factor N −i + j. This quantity clearly
depends sensitively on where you are located within the Young diagram and is not simply
a function of the relative position of two boxes. The factors of the boxes added at diﬀerent
corners will depend on the corner and on the details of the shape of the Young diagram.
– 9 –

JHEP07(2018)146
We will see in what follows that all of the N dependence of the correlators comes from
factors, so that moving between diﬀerent corners shifts N →Neﬀ, which changes the rank
of the emergent gauge group. The only diﬀerence between the planar limit of the emergent
gauge theories at each corner is this shift in N.
A second ingredient in the two point function of restricted Schur polynomials, is a
ratio of the product of the hook lengths of the Young diagram. Assume that we have a
total of C outward pointing corners and further that our localized excitation is stacked in
the ith corner. In the appendix A we prove the following result

The notation in the above formulas is deﬁned in ﬁgure 2. Formula (2.10) is telling us
that although hooks+R/hooks+r depends on the background this dependence is a simple
multiplicative factor that is sensitive to the shape of the Young diagram for the LLM
geometry and the number of ﬁelds in the excitation that are not Z ﬁelds. Its dependence
on R and r nicely matches hooksR/hooksr. Note that (2.10) is not exact — it receives
1
N corrections.
Our discussion in this section has focused on operators constructed using only 2 ﬁelds,
Z and Y . The generalization is straight forward. For k diﬀerent species of ﬁelds (which
may include additional scalars, fermions or covariant derivatives), with nk ﬁelds of each
species, we consider a subgroup Sn1 ×Sn2 ×· · ·×Snk of Sn1+n2+···+nk. By including enough
diﬀerent species we can describe any operator in the planar limit of the CFT. It is again
clear that although the action of the symmetric group on impurities is not background
independent, traces over these elements are and that multiplicity labels and expansion
coeﬃcients are again background independent.
2.2
Excitations of AdS5×S5
Start in the simplest setting in which no giant graviton branes have condensed and consider
excitations that are dual to operators with a bare dimension of order J with J2 ≪N. This
corresponds to the planar limit of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills. In this limit there are
important simpliﬁcations. First, diﬀerent trace structures don’t mix.3 This is phrased as

The two point function of single traces is of order 1, while the two point function of a
double trace with a single trace operator goes to zero. We have considered mixing between
single and double traces, but the conclusion is general: to mix diﬀerent trace structures, we
break color index loops to match traces structures and every time we break an index loop it
costs a factor of N. The fact that diﬀerent trace structures do not mix in the planar limit
is an important result, ultimately responsible for the existence of the spin chain language.
Indeed, the absence of mixing implies it is consistent to restrict to single trace operators
and each single trace operator can be identiﬁed with a speciﬁc spin chain state. We will
derive a formula for the correlation functions of certain excitations of a (heavy) operator
with an enormous ∼N2 dimension in terms of the correlation functions of the planar
limit. As a consequence of this formula, we will see that simpliﬁcations of the planar limit
encoded in correlation functions are then automatically present in correlation functions of
certain excitations of the background.
We will make extensive use of the two point function of the restricted Schur polynomial,
given by [15]
⟨χR,(r,s)αβ(Z, Y )χT,(t,u)δγ(Z, Y )†⟩= δRSδrtδsuδαδδβγ

(2.14)
In the above formula fR stands for the product of factors of Young diagram R, while hooksR
stands for the product of hook lengths of Young diagram R. This result is exact for the
free ﬁeld theory, i.e. all ribbon diagrams have been summed. Thus, the above formula is
reliable for correlators of operators regardless of their dimension. This is why its useful to
express our computations in the restricted Schur polynomial language: we can tackle both
the planar correlators (with dimension ≤O(
√
N)) and correlators in the background of a
heavy operator (with dimension of O(N2)) using a single formalism.
The computation of correlation functions most useful for our goals, starts by expressing
the operators of interest as linear combinations of restricted Schur polynomials. This is
always possible because the restricted Schur polynomials furnish a basis for the local gauge
invariant operators of the theory. An arbitrary operator OA
OA = Tr(σY ⊗m ⊗Z⊗n) = Y i1
iσ(1) · · · Y im
iσ(m)Zim+1
iσ(m+1) · · · Zin+m

can be written as a linear combination of restricted Schur polynomials as follows
OA =

R,r,s,α,β

R,(r,s),α,βχR,(r,s)αβ(Z, Y, X, · · · )
(2.16)

JHEP07(2018)146
By changing the permutation σ appearing in (2.15) we can obtain any desired multi trace
structure. Taking linear combinations of these terms, we can easily construct, for example,
the operators that would map into the states of the spin chain. Explicit formulas for the
coeﬃcients are known
Tr(σZ⊗nY ⊗m) =
X
T,(t,u)αβ
dT n!m!
dtdu(n + m)!χT,(t,u)αβ(σ−1)χT,(t,u)βα(Z, Y )
(2.17)
We will not however need the precise values of the a(A)
R,{r},α. Formula (2.17) does however
make it clear that these coeﬃcients are symmetric group data and consequently, they are
independent of N. Using the known two point function for the restricted Schur polynomial,
we ﬁnd in the free ﬁeld theory, that

The above result is exact and its an ingredient in the proof of the identity relating planar
correlation functions of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory to the correlations functions of
the emergent gauge theories that arise in large N but non-planar limits.
The planar
approximation to the correlation function in free ﬁeld theory is obtained by truncating the
above exact result to its leading term in a large N expansion.
Up to now we have focused on operators constructed using only the Z and Y ﬁelds.
The most general operator will be constructed from adjoint scalars, adjoint fermions or
covariant derivatives of these ﬁelds. The construction of restricted Schur polynomials with
an arbitrary number of species of adjoint scalars and an arbitrary number of species of
adjoint fermions was given in [46]. The construction of restricted Schur polynomials using
covariant derivatives has been described in [47]. Each power of the covariant derivative
Dp
µZ must be treated as a new species of ﬁeld. If the operator we consider is constructed
using a total of k species of ﬁelds, then the restricted Schur polynomial becomes χR,{r},αβ,
with {r} a collection of k Young diagrams, one for each species. If we use ni ﬁelds of species
i the corresponding Young diagram ri has ni boxes. Young diagram r1 corresponds to the
Z ﬁeld. Young diagram R has n1 + n2 + . . . + nk boxes. The additional labels contained
in α and β are again discrete labels distinguishing operators that carry the same R, {r}
labels. The formulas we have given above now generalize as follows

In the above formulas, δ{r},{t} is 1 if the complete ordered sets of Young diagrams {r} and

the planar correlation functions.
2.3
Exitations of an LLM geometry
The LLM geometries that we consider are described by Schur polynomials χB(Z) of the
complex matrix Z labeled by a Young diagram B with O(N2) boxes and O(1) outward
pointing corners. An example of a possible Young diagram B, with 5 outward pointing
corners is shown in ﬁgure 2.
All of the horizontal edges Mi, and vertical edges Ni have a length of O(N). Excita-
tions are obtained by adding J = O(
√
N) boxes to B. These new boxes could be stacked at
any of the inward pointing corners, below or to the right4 of B. The possible locations for
the new boxes are labeled 0 to 5 in ﬁgure 2. We will distinguish between excitations con-
structed by adding all extra boxes at a single inward pointing corner (localized excitations)
and excitations constructed by adding extra boxes at more than one corner (delocalized
excitations). In the free ﬁeld theory, thanks to the fact that the two point function of
the restricted Schur polynomial is diagonal in all of its labels, the local and delocalized
4We could also create excitations by eroding the outward pointing corners. We will not study these
excitations here.

CFT in the above sum is the Hilbert space of
an emergent gauge theory and is isomorphic to the space of local operators in the planar
limit of the original CFT, as we now explain. We do this by giving the bijection between
operators of dimension J with J2 ≪N and operators in H(i)
CFT. The bijection maps the
operator given in (2.20) above into

(2.24)
The coeﬃcients of the expansion appearing in (2.20) are identical to the coeﬃcients ap-
pearing in (2.24). It is only the R and r1 labels in the restricted Schur polynomials in (2.20)
and (2.24) that have changed. The Young diagram +R is obtained by stacking R at the
ith corner of B and similarly, the Young diagram +r is obtained by stacking r at the ith
corner of B. For an example of how this works, see ﬁgure 3.
This mapping is a bijection. Operators with distinct labels are orthogonal. Operators
with distinct labels before the map have distinct labels after the map. Thus, the mapping
is injective. Any operator with a bare dimension J and J2 ≪N can be mapped to an

to the correspondence, the inner product of two states is related to the correlators of the corresponding
operators.

excitation of the background B. What is important here is that, since each edge of the
Young diagram has a length of order N, there is no danger that when we stack R it
will not ﬁt onto the corner. Of course, the converse is also true: any excitation of the
background can be mapped to an operator of dimension J by deleting the boxes in +R
and +r1 which belong to B. Thus, the map is surjective. This demonstrates that our
mapping is a bijection.
In the remainder of this section we will argue that the correlation functions of operators
that are in bijection are related in a particularly simple way, in the large N limit. We would
like to normalize our correlators so that

The two results are nearly identical. The only diﬀerence, apart from the overall factor
(ηB)nI, is that fR in the planar result is replaced by f+R

This demonstrates a remarkable relationship between correlators in the planar and non-
planar limits.
This result has a number of immediate applications. As we have stressed above, the fact
that operators with diﬀerent trace structures don’t mix in the planar limit is a statement
about correlators. This no-mixing result allows focus on the single trace operators which
is needed to develop the spin chain connection for the planar CFT.
Our result (2.34)
immediately implies that operators that are the image of operators with diﬀerent trace
structures, will not mix. Thus, we too can focus on the image of single trace operators
and then develop a spin chain description of the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory.
States of the spin chain that were identiﬁed with a given operator in the planar limit will
now be identiﬁed with the image of the same operator.

Three point functions of single trace operators are suppressed in the planar limit of the
original CFT. Is there a similar statement for three point functions of single trace operators
in the emergent gauge theory? In any Poincare invariant CFT the spacetime dependence
of the three point function is ﬁxed by conformal invariance. We can thus simply factor this
dependence out and consider the problem of the combinatorics of the Wick contractions.
This is also a complicated problem, but for some well chosen examples it can be solved.
Consider the following correlator
⟨Tr (Zn1Y n2 · · · )Tr (Zm1Y m2 · · · )Tr (Z†p1Y †p2 · · · )⟩
(2.35)
The Wick contractions are all between the ﬁrst trace and the third trace, and between
the second trace and the third trace. In particular, there are no contractions between the
ﬁrst and second traces. For the combinatorics of the Wick contractions, we can treat the
double trace Tr (Zn1Y n2 · · · )Tr (Zm1Y m2 · · · ) as a single operator and apply the bijection
and treat Tr (Z†p1Y †p2 · · · ) as a single operator and apply the bijection. Thus, we have
reduced the computation to a two point function. This two point correlator correctly sums
the contractions between the three traces with each other and with the background. The
result (2.34) then implies that this correlator, which is giving the three point function,
is suppressed in the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. Since OPE coeﬃcients
are read from three point functions, the OPE coeﬃcients vanish in the planar limit of
both N = 4 super Yang-Mills and the emergent gauge theory. We have proved this in
the free ﬁeld theory, for a speciﬁc class of correlators. We conjecture that it holds quite
generally and continues to hold when interactions are turned on. The usual suppression
holds because we need to break index loops (which costs N−1 for each loop we break) to
ﬁnd a non-zero correlator between three single traces. This does not rely on any detailed
structure of the interaction and is quite generally true for a matrix model. Of course, this
is one point in our analysis that could be improved.
Our argument in this section considers only the local operators. One might wonder if
mixing between diﬀerent trace structures of delocalized operators is also suppressed or not.
In this case the argument is more involved. It is unlikely that there is a simple relationship
between correlators of delocalized operator and correlators computed in the planar limit.
Explicit computations using concrete examples support the conclusion that again, diﬀerent
trace structures don’t mix. See appendix C for a discussion of this point.
To summarize, we have arrived at a rather detailed picture of the structure of the
Hilbert space. We have decomposed the Hilbert space of excitations of the LLM geometry
into a direct sum
HCFT;LLM =
 M
i
H(i)
CFT
! M
HCFT;Delocalized
(2.36)
Restricted Schur polynomials are orthogonal if their labels don’t match. This immediately
implies that in the free ﬁeld theory operators belonging to diﬀerent Hilbert spaces in the
above sum have vanishing two point functions and hence that the corresponding subspaces
are orthogonal. We have further argued that each subspace can be decomposed into a direct
– 17 –

JHEP07(2018)146
sum of orthogonal components, with each component collecting operators of a deﬁnite
“trace structure”.
Here the trace structure is read from the preimage of the operator
under the bijection (2.24). At large N these diﬀerent trace structures do not mix.
Our study has focused on the free ﬁeld theory. Of course, the bijection we have deﬁned
holds for any coupling. The free ﬁeld limit has been used to obtain the relationship between
correlators of operators and correlators of their images. It is this discussion that we will
extend to weak coupling in the next section.

Weak coupling CFT
We expect that the gravitational physics dual to the CFT is coded into the large N cor-
relators. Consequently, it is attractive if we can ﬁnd relationships between correlators of
the planar limit and correlators in the background of a heavy operator. In the previous
section we have exhibited relationships of this type, all in the free limit of the CFT. We
expect the dual gravitational description is simplest when the CFT is strongly coupled. It
is natural to ask if the simple relations between correlation functions exhibited in the free
theory survive when interactions are added. Answering this question is the goal of the cur-
rent section. We start with a careful discussion of the one loop dilatation operator, which
develops the relation between correlators at one loop. This argument also gives insight into
why the relationship we have uncovered between correlators holds even when higher loop
corrections are included.
The article [21] argued that matrix elements of the planar dilation operator are identical
to matrix elements of the dilatation operator computed using local excitations, localized
at corner8 i of the Young diagram for the LLM geometry, after replacing λ = g2
YMN by
λeﬀ= g2
YMNeﬀwhere Neﬀis the factor of the ﬁrst box added to corner i. This again
amounts to replacing N →Neﬀso it is the rule we derived in section 2.3! We will revisit
this argument below adding two new improvements
1. By carefully tracking what is background independent and what is not we will develop
a much simpler technical analysis.
2. We will phrase the result using the bijection we developed in section 2.3. The advan-
tage of the rephrasing is that it supports the conclusion that the planar limit of the
emergent gauge theory is planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills.
The ﬁnal result is remarkable: in the large N but non-planar limit we need to sum a huge
set of Feynman diagrams. The net eﬀect of summing the huge set of non-planar diagrams,
is a simple rescaling of the ’t Hooft coupling. This is in complete harmony with the physical
argument we developed in the introduction.
The fact that we simply need to rescale the ’t Hooft coupling has far reaching con-
sequences: since the dilatation operator in the planar CFT matches the Hamiltonian of
an integrable spin chain, we know that the dilatation operator describing the anomalous
dimensions of the emergent gauge theory will also match the integrable spin chain. As
8These operators belong to H(i)
CFT.
– 18 –

JHEP07(2018)146
long as the dilatation operator does not mix operators that belong to the Hilbert space
H(i)
CFT with operators that don’t belong to this space, we conclude that there are integrable
subsectors in the large N but non-planar limit we consider. Demonstrating the absence of
this mixing is one of the main goals of this section.
Before turning to a detailed technical analysis we will brieﬂy review the evidence
supporting the above result. It implies that the anomalous dimensions of the operators of
the planar emergent gauge theory are determined in terms of the corresponding dimensions
computed in the planar CFT.
Explicit computations of anomalous dimensions of the
emergent CFT, when developed in a perturbative expansion, conﬁrm this prediction both
in the weak coupling CFT and at strong coupling using the dual string theory [21, 45].
Using the su(2|2) symmetry enjoyed by the su(3|2) subspace of local excitations, the two
magnon S-matrix has been determined and it agrees up to two loops with a weak coupling
computation performed in the CFT [22]. The ﬁrst ﬁnite size corrections to both the magnon
and the dyonic magnon have been computed by constructing solutions to the Nambu-Goto
action that carry ﬁnite angular momentum. These computations [22] again show that the
net aﬀect of the background is a scaling of the ’t Hooft coupling. This constitutes strong
coupling evidence for our result. Since these corrections are sensitive to the overall phase
of the S-matrix, which is not determined by kinematics (i.e. the su(2|2)2 symmetry of the
theory), this is a non-trivial test. Finally, strings spinning on the three sphere that belongs
to AdS5 have been considered in [41]. These strings are dual to operators belonging to the
SL(2) sector of the gauge theory. Once again, the net aﬀect of the background is a scaling
of the ’t Hooft coupling as predicted [41].
In the subsection that follows we revisit the analysis of [21], phrasing things in terms
of the bijection of section 2.3 and paying attention the background dependence of the
various ingredients in the analysis. This signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the original analysis. We
pay careful attention to operator mixing, to give evidence supporting the conclusion that
the integrable subsectors are decoupled at large N. This closes an important hole in the
analysis of [21].
Finally, we consider how the one loop discussion generalizes when we
include higher loops.
3.1
One loop mixing of local operators
From now on we normalize the two point function of our operators to 1. To simplify the
discussion again focus on operators constructed using only Z and Y ﬁelds. It is a simple
generalization to include more ﬁelds. Consider the mixing between two restricted Schur
polynomials, O+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2(Z, Y ) and O+T,(+t,u)ν1ν2(Z, Y ). The capital letter O for the
restricted Schur polynomial instead of the χ stresses the fact we are considering normalized
operators

In the above expression Young diagram +R′ is obtained by dropping one box from +R
and c+R,+R′ is the factor of the box that is dropped. Also, dr is the dimension of sym-
metric group irreducible representation r. Use n to denote the total number of Z ﬁelds
in O+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2 and nB to denote the number of Z ﬁelds in the background. Also, nZ
denotes the number of Z ﬁelds in OR,(r,s)µ1µ2 and m denotes the number of Y ﬁelds. We
have n = nB + nZ. The above result (3.2), (3.3) was derived using the convention that the
Y ﬁelds occupy slots 1 to m exactly as shown in (2.7). In the standard tableau labeling of
the states in +R, the Y ’s would be associated to the boxes labeled 1 to m. This result is
the exact one loop result - we have not made use of any of the simpliﬁcations that come
from taking N →∞. Notice that the N dependence of the matrix elements appears in
c+R,+R′, f+R or f+T . This immediately implies that we will again have a dependence on
Neﬀand not on N.
To proceed further, begin by discussing the intertwining map P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2. Our goal
is to give a careful argument concluding that P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2 is background independent.
This map acts within a direct sum of the carrier space of +T and the carrier space of +R.
It gives zero on +T and projects the row and column labels of the +R subspace to an
(r, s) irreducible representation of Sn ×Sm. Our convention is that the ﬁrst boxes removed
are associated to Y . This projection operator simply has to assemble these boxes into an
irreducible representation s of Sm. The remaining boxes are already in +r. Thus, the
projection operator is
P+R,(+r,s) = 1
m!
X
σ∈Sm
χs(σ)Γ+R(σ)
(3.4)
In writing the above projection operator it is understood that we are acting in the subspace
of +R in which states are labeled by standard tableau such that labels 1,. . . ,m only ﬁll
boxes that belong to +R and not to +r. This is the subspace in which the remaining
boxes are already in +r. To get the intertwining map, restrict the above row and column
labels. The key point is that the projection operator acts only on boxes associated to the
Y ﬁelds. Restricting indices to get the intertwining map will not change this so that the
intertwining map P+R,(+r,s)αβ only has a nontrivial action on the Y boxes, that is, on the
boxes that are removed from +R to get +r. With the discussion of section 2.1 in mind,
its clear that P+R,(+r,s)αβ is background independent.

To evaluate the matrix elements of the dilatation operator, we need to perform the

The intertwining maps I+R′+T ′ and I+T ′+R′ map from the subspace +R′ obtained by
dropping a single box from +R, to the subspace +T ′ obtained by dropping a single box
from +T. As a result, these maps act only on the box in the standard tableau labeled 1
which is associated to a Y and hence these maps are background independent. The results
of section 2.1 imply that the above trace is background independent. Lets pursue this
further in our current example. The intertwining maps P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2 and P+T,(+t,u)ν2ν1
act only on the boxes labeled 1 to m — all Y boxes, and the permutation (1, m + 1) acts
only on boxes labeled 1 or m + 1. One is a Y box, one is a Z box and both belong to the
excitation. Consequently, in the above trace the very vast majority of boxes — those with
labels > m+1 and there are O(N2) of them — are simply spectators and can be traced over.
Recall that we are focusing on operators that belong to a given emergent gauge theory.
The non-trivial structure of the matrix elements is determined by the Young diagrams R, r
and s and it will agree with the non-trivial structure of the planar matrix elements - this is
the background independence. The only diﬀerence between the planar result for the trace
and what we consider above, is that the sum over the inert boxes produces a factor d+r′
i
where +r′
i is obtained by dropping a box from row i of r in +r while in the planar case we
get a factor of dr′
i. If we now consider mixing with operators outside of the emergent gauge
theory, in principle we could drop a box from +r at any location - even a corner that is
distinct from where our excitation is located. These matrix elements arise when there is
mixing with states that don’t belong to the integrable subsector. We will consider these
corrections in detail in the next section. Our conclusion is that these matrix elements vanish
at large N. Using this result, we can restrict to mixing between operators that belong to
the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. Consequently, the bijection of section 2.3
relates these operators to two operators, OR,(r,s)µ1µ2(Z, Y ) and OT,(t,u)ν1ν2(Z, Y ) deﬁned
in the planar CFT. We will now derive a relationship between the matrix elements for
mixing O+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2(Z, Y ) and O+T,(+t,u)ν1ν2(Z, Y ) and those for mixing OR,(r,s)µ1µ2(Z, Y )
and OT,(t,u)ν1ν2(Z, Y ). This extends the free ﬁeld theory relationship between correlators
obtained in section 2.3, to one loop. The argument is9

In moving to the third line above we have used the formula (2.10) proved in appendix A.
This is the only step in the above computation that is not exact, but relies on the large N
limit. Notice that the only diﬀerence between the last line above and the matrix elements
of the dilatation operator in the planar limit is that N is replaced with Neﬀ. This is then
a simple proof that at large N, the matrix elements of the one loop dilatation operator
with respect to states of the emergent gauge theory are given by replacing N →Neﬀin
the matrix elements of the planar dilatation operator, taken with respect to the preimages
of these states.
How does this generalize to higher loops? The two loop dilatation operator has been
considered in [48] and from that analysis it is clear what the general results are.
The
structure of the matrix elements are very similar to the form shown in (3.3). One again
lands up computing a trace. The same intertwining maps P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2 and P+T,(+t,u)ν1ν2
appear in the trace. The maps IR′T ′, IT ′R′ are replaced at L loops by maps which map
from a representation R(L) obtained by dropping L boxes from R to a representation T (L)
obtained by dropping L boxes from T. There are also again permutations that act on the
boxes associated to the excitation. Finally, the trace is multiplied by the square root of
the factors of the boxes dropped from R and T. Arguing as we did above, its clear that
the trace is background independent and the product of factors implies that the simple
rule N →Neﬀagain applies. These observations imply that our one loop conclusion goes
through when higher loop corrections are included.
To summarize, we have found integrable subsectors in the large N but non-planar limit
that we are considering. Each integrable subsector is an emergent gauge theory, with its
own gauge group U(Neﬀ). To complete this discussion, in the next section we will consider
the mixing between the integrable and non-integrable subsectors.
3.2
Mixing with delocalized operators
The operators that belong to the planar limit of a given emergent gauge theory are localized
at a given corner and deﬁne an integrable subsector of the theory. There are operators that
are not localized at one corner - they straddle two or more corners. If these delocalized
operators mix with the localized operators they will almost certainly ruin integrability of
the emergent gauge theory. In this section we consider the mixing between localized and
– 22 –

delocalized operators. Our main result is that
⟨φ|D|ψ⟩= 0
|φ⟩∈HCFT;Local
|ψ⟩∈HCFT;Delocalized
(3.7)
at large N.
We make extensive of two basic observations.
First, in computing the matrix ele-
ment (3.3), it is clear that the reason why two diﬀerent states can have a non-zero matrix
element, is because the permutation group element (1, m + 1) acts to change the iden-
tity of the state. It is thus important to have a good understanding of the action of this
permutation on a standard tableau. Since we are computing a trace which has the same
value in any equivalent representation, we can carry this computation out in any conve-
nient representation. In what follows, we will use Young’s orthogonal representation. This
representation is speciﬁed by giving the action of adjacent swaps which are two cycles of
the form (i, i + 1). Given the matrices representing the complete set of adjacent swaps,
it is easy to generate the rest of the group. Let |ψ⟩denote a valid standard tableau and
let |ψ⟩i↔i+1 denote the state obtained from |ψ⟩by swapping i and i + 1. The content of
the box labeled i, denoted c(i) is given by b −a if the box is in row a and column b. Our
convention for the standard tableau labeling is spelled out in the following example
5 4 3 2 1
(3.8)
The rule specifying the matrix representing the adjacent swap is

1
c(i) −c(i + 1)|ψ⟩+
s
1 −
1
(c(i) −c(i + 1))2 |ψ⟩i↔i+1
(3.9)
If boxes i and i + 1 are located at diﬀerent corners, the ﬁrst term above is of order N−1
and can be neglected in the large N limit while the coeﬃcient of the second term is 1, to
the same accuracy.
The second observation is a relationship between the loop order and the number of
boxes that can diﬀer in the Young diagram labels of the operators that are mixing. To
add loop eﬀects, we consider Feynman diagrams with a certain number of vertices included
in the diagram. Contracting two ﬁelds in a restricted Schur polynomial with a vertex has
the eﬀect of setting the indices of two diﬀerent ﬁelds equal. This Kronecker delta function
restricts the sum over permutations in (2.7) from Sn+m to Sn+m−1. Two operators which
begin as distinct representations of Sn+m may well produce the same representation of
Sn+m−1. For this to happen, their Young diagram labels must diﬀer in the placement of at
most one box. This is manifest in the matrix element (3.3), because the maps IT ′R′ which
appear are only non-zero if T ′ (obtained by dropping one box from T) has the same shape
as R′ (obtained by dropping one box from R). At L loops we have added L vertices which
lands up restricting the sum in (2.7) from Sn+m to Sn+m−L. In this case operators that
diﬀer by at most L boxes will mix.
As a warm up example, consider the mixing of localized operators that belong to
diﬀerent corners

with j ̸= i.
This represents a mixing between states of two diﬀerent planar emergent
gauge theories, i.e. two distinct integrable subsectors. For concreteness imagine that these
two operators are the images of R(r, s)αβ and T(t, u)γδ under the bijection described in
section 2.3. These two operators disagree in the placement of J ∼O(
√
N) boxes, since
the excitation which has J boxes is located at corner i for state |φ⟩and at corner j for
state |ψ⟩. Thus, these two operators will start to mix at the J loop order. Further, for
a non-zero intertwining map IR(J),T (J) we need to drop the boxes that disagree between
the two operators.10 This implies that, after expressing permutations that appear in the
dilatation operator in terms of adjacent swaps, only the ﬁrst term on the right hand side
of (3.9) contributes. We need to swap all of the distant and local boxes which leads to
a suppression of O(N−1), for every box in the excitation. Consequently this mixing is
completely suppressed at large N and (3.10) holds.
We are now ready to tackle (3.7). Consider a localized excitation, located at corner i.
We study the mixing of this localized excitation with a delocalized excitation, that has k
boxes at corner j ̸= i and is otherwise located at corner i. These two operators disagree
in the placement of at least k boxes and so the ﬁrst time they can possibly mix is at k
loops. To get a non-zero answer, for the interwining map, we need to drop the boxes that
don’t agree and this means that we must keep terms in which distant boxes remain distant.
This again amounts to retaining the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (3.9) and hence a
suppression of O(N−1), for every distant box. Consequently this mixing is suppressed as
∼N−k at large N. This demonstrates that (3.7) holds at large N.
We will end this section with a simple example illustrating the above argument. The
operators which mix are labeled by the Young diagrams shown in (3.11). They have a total
of 2 Y ﬁelds and many Z ﬁelds.
A =
∗
∗Y
∗
Y
B =
∗Y
∗Y
∗
(3.11)
A and B are the Young diagrams for the excitations in the background. They both have
O(N2) boxes. The boxes labeled with a Y correspond to Y ﬁelds and they may be labeled
1. The boxes with a ∗are Z ﬁelds and may be labeled with m + 1 = 3. For a non-zero
answer, the states in A which contribute have the bottom Y labeled with a 1. Only in this
case can we match the shape of B, after one box - the upper Y box - is dropped. Using
Dirac notation, the structure of the terms contributing to (3.5) are
X
i,j
⟨A′, i|P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2(1, m + 1)|A′, j⟩⟨B′, j|P+T,(+t,u)ν1ν2(1, m + 1)|B′, i⟩
(3.12)
It is clear that the only way that ⟨A′, i|P+R,(+r,s)µ1µ2(1, m + 1)|A′, j⟩can be non-zero is if
we keep the ﬁrst term in (3.9) when the permutation acts. Since the only boxes labeled
with m + 1 (the starred boxes) are distant from the bottom Y box in A, this is suppressed
as
1
N .
10We use R(J) to denote a Young diagram obtained by dropping J boxes from R and similarly for T (J).

Strong coupling CFT
In this section we want to explore the string theory interpretation of our results, adding to
the discussion of the introduction. The excitations we have considered in the CFT are all
dual to excitations of the D3-brane giant gravitons that condensed to produce the geometry.
These are all open string excitations and we have demonstrated that they lead to emergent
gauge theories. In this section we will motivate why adding boxes to the Young diagrams
give excitations that are localized to the brane, that is, why they are open strings. There
are also closed string excitations in the dual string theory. We will give an example of a
closed string excitation. For relevant earlier literature see [49–52].
Why does adding extra boxes to a Young diagram as we have done above, lead to open
strings excitations? We can also phrase this question as: why does adding extra boxes
to a Young diagram lead to excitations localized on the branes? Recall that there is an
intimate connection between the entanglement of the underlying degrees of freedom and
the geometry of spacetime. This is manifested in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entan-
glement entropy in terms of the area of a minimal surface [53]. Further, Van Raamsdonk
has conjectured that the amount of entanglement between two regions is related to the
distance between them: the more the entanglement the less the distance between the two
regions [54]. For a recent relevant discussion see [28]. To apply this to our set up, recall
that the Young diagram is an instruction for how an operator composed of many ﬁelds
is to be constructed. Each box corresponds to a distinct ﬁeld and the indices of ﬁelds in
the same row are to be symmetrized, while the indices of ﬁelds in the same column are
to be antisymmetrized. This will in the end produce a highly entangled state, with ﬁelds
corresponding to boxes that are nearby on the Young diagram being more entangled than
boxes that are more distant. The Young diagram becomes a convenient way to visual-
ize the entanglement so that boxes that are nearby on the Young diagram, are nearby in
spacetime. To make these comments more precise we would need a better understanding
of entanglement for multi part quantum systems.
If this interpretation is correct, then to produce a closed string excitation (which is not
localized on the brane), we should construct an operator whose indices are not symmetrized
or antisymmetrized with indices of the ﬁelds making up the background. An example of
such an operator is given by O{k} = Tr (Y k1Xk2Y k3 · · · ).
Since this is a closed string
state, we expect that the mixing of this operator with the background will correspond to
closed string absorption by a brane. Intuition from a single brane suggests that this is
highly suppressed because gs ∼O(N−1) at large N. However, we are dealing with O(N)
branes so that we can’t neglect mixing of O{k} with the background. If this mixing were
suppressed, we would be dealing with an SU(2) sector of the planar Yang-Mills theory
which is integrable. We will explore this issue at strong coupling using string theory.
The state dual to O{k} should be a closed string moving in an LLM geometry. The
general LLM geometry is described by the metric [9] (i, j = 1, 2)
ds2 = −y(eG + e−G)(dt + Vidxi)2 +

on geometries given by concentric black annuli on the bubbling plane. For a set of rings

Notice that the energy depends on b(0) which is a function of all of the R2
l . Each Rl is
associated to a given collection of branes. The fact that our energy is a function of all
of the Rl’s implies that it is not localized on a speciﬁc brane world volume, supporting
its interpretation as a closed string. This is dual to the gauge theory operator O{k} =
Tr (Y k1Xk2Y k3 · · · ) described above. It is not dual to an open string and is hence not an
excitation of any of the emergent gauge theories we described in previous sections. The
result (4.12) is the energy of a single magnon with N →Neﬀwhere
Neﬀ= N1(M + N1)(M + N1 + N2)
M2 + N2
1 + M(2N1 + N2)
(4.13)
and N1 + N2 = N. In writing this formula we specialized to a geometry with a central
black disk of area N1, a white ring of area M and a black ring of area N2. Consequently
we have a geometry described by three radii
πR2
1 = N1
πR2
2 = N1 + M
πR2
3 = N1 + N2 + M
(4.14)
By using these values in the expression for b(0) we ﬁnd 4.13. If we take N2 = O(1) = M
at large N we ﬁnd Neﬀ= N1 = N(1 + O(N−1)). This is exactly as expected since this
boundary condition corresponds to exciting so few giant gravitons that backreaction can
be neglected and we must recover the AdS5×S5 result as we have done. The above result
shows that the closed string is exploring the geometry at r = 0 in the bubbling plane.
This region simply can’t be explored by adding boxes to any corner of the background
Young diagram. The result depends in a nontrivial way on the details of the background,
as we might expect for an excitation that is not localized on a speciﬁc set of branes. This
supports our interpretation that this is a closed string excitation. For this closed string
excitation once again the only change as compared to the planar limit is the replacement
N →Neﬀ. This is probably only a property of the strong coupling limit. Indeed, in the
free theory the correlator of the closed string excitation and the background factorizes
⟨χ)B(Z)χB(Z)†O{k}O†
{k}⟩= ⟨χ)B(Z)χB(Z)†⟩⟨O{k}O†
{k}⟩
(4.15)
which is not consistent with a simple N →Neﬀreplacement.

Summary and outlook
In this article we have considered excitations of LLM geometries.
The excitations are
constructed by adding boxes (representing the excitation) to a Young diagram with O(N2)
boxes (representing the LLM geometry).
Adding a box to a row of a Young diagram
implies that the indices of the added operator will be symmetrized or antisymmetrized with
the indices of adjacent boxes, so that the ﬁelds associated to the boxes added are highly
entangled with the ﬁelds associated to adjacent boxes. Two objects that are entangled
are nearby in spacetime, so that we produce excitations that are localized to the brane
worldvolume. These excitations are open strings and hence give rise to an emergent gauge
theory. We have constructed a bijection between operators in the Hilbert space of planar
N = 4 super Yang-Mills and operators in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge
theory. Free ﬁeld correlators of operators that are in bijection are related in a very simple
way. This immediately implies that since three point functions of single trace operators
are suppressed in the planar limit of the original free CFT, they are also suppressed in the
planar limit of the free emergent gauge theory. Since OPE coeﬃcients are read from three
point functions, the OPE coeﬃcients vanish in the planar limit of both free N = 4 super
Yang-Mills and the free emergent gauge theory. We have conjectured that this continues
to be the case when interactions are turned on. By considering the weak coupling CFT we
have also given arguments concluding that the anomalous dimensions match the dimensions
of an N = 4 super Yang-Mills with gauge group U(Neﬀ), where Neﬀis read from the factor
of the boxes associated to the excitations.
Since any CFT is determined by its OPE
coeﬃcients and spectrum of anomalous dimensions, this strongly suggests that the planar
limit of the emergent gauge theories are planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills theories.
We have been careful to stress that the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory agrees
with planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills. The stronger statement, that the emergent gauge
theory is N = 4 super Yang-Mills is not true: there are important diﬀerences between the
two theories that are only apparent when going beyond the planar limit. The emergent
gauge theory has gauge group U(Neﬀ). If this gauge theory really is N=4 super Yang-
Mills theory we expect a stringy exclusion principle cutting oﬀthe angular momentum of
the giant graviton at momentum Neﬀ. In actual fact, the maximum angular momentum
for a giant graviton is in general below this and it is set by the shape of the background
Young diagram. Similarly, dual giant gravitons can usually have an arbitrarily large angular
momentum. In the emergent gauge theory, the dual giant must ﬁt inside the corner at which
the emergent gauge theory is located, so there are no dual giant excitations with arbitrarily
large momentum. These discrepancies arise because the giant graviton excitations detect
the structure of the bubbling plane. They can probe the diﬀerence between a black disk
in a sea of white or just one ring among many or something else. So even in the large N
limit, the emergent gauge theory and N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory are diﬀerent. They
do however share the same planar limit.
An interesting technical result that has been achieved is the description of states when
some of the rows of the Young diagram describing the giant graviton branes are equal in
length. Previous studies [42, 43, 56] have considered the displaced corners approximation
– 28 –

JHEP07(2018)146
in which the length between any two rows (for a system of dual giant gravitons) scales as
N in the large N limit. In this situation, the action of the symmetric group simpliﬁes and
explicit formulas for the restricted characters can be developed [42, 56]. Here we have the
case that many row lengths are of comparable size. Progress is achieved by uncovering the
relationship between the relevant restricted Schur computations and those of the planar
limit. We also allowed some Z ﬁelds in the excitation which includes the case that the row
lengths are similar but not identical.
There are a number of interesting directions that could be pursued. First, perhaps
there are new holographic dualities: each emergent gauge theory might itself be dual to an
AdS5×S5 geometry, in a suitable limit. There maybe a limit of the geometry that zooms
in on the edge of the black regions in the bubbling plane to give an AdS5×S5 geometry
with Neﬀunits of ﬁve form ﬂux. Restricting to excitations that belong to H(i)
CFT is how
we restrict to the integrable subsector in the CFT. The limit that isolates an AdS5×S5
geometry would restrict us to the integrable subsector in the string theory. This is currently
under active investigation [55].
There are a number of questions we could pursue to further explore the dynamics of
the emergent gauge theory. As we have mentioned, the worldvolume of the giant gravitons
is a distinct space from the space on which the original CFT is deﬁned. How is locality
in this emergent space of the emergent gauge theory realized? This may provide a simple
testing ground for ideas addressing the emergence of spacetime.
We have argued that
there are integrable subsectors in large N but non-planar limits of N = 4 super Yang-
Mills. Can we ﬁnd further evidence for the integrability of these subsectors? Even more
important, how can this integrability be exploited to explore the physics of emergent gauge
theories in interesting and non-trivial ways? For other promising indications of integrability
beyond the planar limit see [57–59]. Besides the local observables we have considered, the
emergent gauge theory will have Wilson loops. It maybe interesting to explore these non-
local observables.
The emergent gauge theory that we have explored in this article is only a decoupled
sector at large N. What are the ﬁrst corrections which couple the emergent gauge the-
ory to the rest of the theory? Presumably these corrections correspond to closed string
absorption/emission by branes. This is something concrete that can be evaluated.
Finally, decoupling limits for gauge theory living on the intersections of giant gravitons
have been considered in [60–64]. It would be interesting to see if the methods developed in
this article can be used to clarify the emergent gauge theories arising in these cases, which
may shed light on the microstates of near-extremal black holes in AdS5×S5.

Ratios of hooks
The hook HR(i, j) of the box in row i and column j of R is the set of boxes (a, b) with
a = i and b ≥j or a ≥i and b = j. The hook-length hR(i, j) is the number of boxes in the
hook HR(i, j). To visualize the hook associated to a given box, imagine an elbow with its
joint in the box and one arm exiting R by moving to the right through the row of the box
and one arm exiting by moving down through the column. The hook length is the number
of boxes the elbow passes through. We use hooksR to denote the product of hook lengths
for each box in R. In this appendix we want to derive a formula for the ratio
hooks+R
hooks+r
(A.1)
+r is obtained from +R by removing a total of |R| −|r| boxes. All of these boxes are
located close to corner i of Young diagram B. In what follows we assume that we have a
total of C outward pointing corners and further that our localized excitation is stacked in
the ith corner.
Start by removing a single box from +R to obtain the Young diagram +R′. Consider
the ratio
hooks+R
hooks+R′
(A.2)
Imagine that the box that was removed comes from row a and column b of R. Denote the
length of row a by la and the length of column b by lb. The numbers a, b, la, lb are all much
smaller than
√
N. Most hook lengths in the numerator will equal the hook lengths in the
denominator. The only hook lengths that don’t match are lengths for hooks that enter or
exit through the box that is removed. After many cancellations we ﬁnd

Ratios of factors
Recall that fR denotes the product of the factors of each box in R and that a box in row
i and column j has factor N −i + j. In this appendix we will compute the ratio of the
product of factors for a Young diagram +R and Young diagram B. +R is obtained by
attaching a smaller Young diagram R to the Young diagram B. The argument is rather
simple and most easily illustrated with an explicit example.
Consider the Young diagrams shown in ﬁgure 4 above. It is simple to see that
fR = N(N −1)(N + 1)
(B.1)
and
f+R
fB
= (N + δ)(N + δ −1)(N + δ + 1)
(B.2)
where δ = 1 = 5 −4. In general, if the top most and left most box of R is added to row a
and column b of B, we will have δ = b −a.

C
Delocalized trace structures are preserved
In this appendix we compute correlation functions of delocalized operators. Our results
suggest that, in general, there is no simple relationship between correlation functions of
delocalized operators and correlation functions of operators in the planar limit, even in
the free CFT. The results of our computation do however provide evidence that mixing
between diﬀerent trace structures is suppressed, even for the delocalized operators.
To keep the discussion simple consider operators constructed from a single ﬁeld Z.
This will already probe aspects of the operator mixing issue. As a simple warm up ex-
ample, consider delocalized excitations constructed by starting with operators of the form
Tr(σ1Z⊗n1)Tr(σ2Z⊗n2). To construct a delocalized excitation, begin by writing
Tr(σ1Z⊗n1) =
X
R1⊢n1
χR1(σ1)χR1(Z)
Tr(σ2Z⊗n2) =
X
R2⊢n2
χR2(σ2)χR2(Z)
(C.1)
The delocalized excitation is given by
O(B)(σ1, σ2) =
X
R1,R2
χR1(σ1)χR2(σ2)χ+(R1,R2)(Z)
(C.2)
The Young diagram +(R1, R2) is obtained by adding R1 at the ith inward pointing corner
and adding R2 at the jth inward pointing corner. This corresponds to localizing Tr(σ1Z⊗n1)
at the ith corner and localizing Tr(σ2Z⊗n2) at the jth corner. It is now rather simple to
evaluate the correlator
⟨O(B)(σ1, σ2)(x1)O(B)(τ1, τ2)†(x2)⟩B
=
X
R1⊢n1,R2⊢n2
χR1(σ1)χR2(σ2)χR1(τ1)χR2(τ2)
f+(R1,R2)
fB|x1 −x2|2n1+2n2
=
X
R1⊢n1
χR1(σ1)χR1(τ1) fR1(Neﬀ,1)
|x1 −x2|2n1
X
R2⊢n2
χR2(σ2)χR2(τ2) fR2(Neﬀ,2)
|x1 −x2|2n2
(C.3)
= ⟨Tr(σ1Z⊗n1)(x1)Tr(τ1Z⊗n1)(x2)⟩N→Neﬀ,1⟨Tr(σ2Z⊗n2)(x1)Tr(τ2Z⊗n2)(x2)⟩N→Neﬀ,2
In the above expression, fR(M) means the product of the factors of Young diagram R with
N replaced by M. Further Neﬀ,1 is the factor of the ﬁrst box added to corner i and Neﬀ,2 is
the factor of the ﬁrst box added to corner j. The above result implies that the delocalized
correlator has factorized into two factors, one for each corner on which the operator is
located. Each factor is a correlation function. The value of N is replaced by an eﬀective
value of N for each corner. It is worth emphasizing that the expressions on the last line
of (C.3) are exact. This result implies that trace mixing is even more constrained for the
delocalized excitation than it is in the planar limit. Indeed, in the planar limit we will
have mixing if the trace structure of Tr(σ1Z⊗n1)Tr(σ2Z⊗n2) matches the trace structure
of Tr(τ1Z⊗n1)Tr(τ2Z⊗n2). For the delocalized excitation we will only have mixing if the
– 32 –

JHEP07(2018)146
trace structure of Tr(σ1Z⊗n1) matches Tr(τ1Z⊗n1) and the trace structure of Tr(σ2Z⊗n2)
matches Tr(τ2Z⊗n2).
There is a second type of delocalized excitation we could consider: a single trace
operator that is itself delocalized. As an example, consider a single trace operator that
is distributed between corners i and j. To write such a loop we introduce the space time
independent auxiliary ﬁeld X a
b , which has two point function
⟨X a
b X c
d⟩= δa
dδc
b
(C.4)
Using this auxiliary ﬁeld we can split any single trace operator into two traces, that re-
assemble to give a single trace when the average over X is performed. For example, we can
replace
Tr(Y 5)
−→
Tr(Y 2X)Tr(Y 3X)
(C.5)
Performing the average over X, we recover our original loop
⟨Tr(Y 2X)Tr(Y 3X)⟩= (Y 2)b
a (Y 3)d
c⟨X a
b X c
d⟩= Tr(Y 5)
(C.6)
The advantage of splitting things in this way, is that we can now follow exactly the same
logic that we used for the ﬁrst example above. We will take this to be the deﬁnition of
the delocalized single trace operator. For the general operator constructed from Y s, the
resulting expression is of the form11
OA(Y ) =
X
R1,R2,r1,r2
a(A)
R1,R2,r1,r2χR1,(r1,
)(Y, X)χR2,(r2,
)(Y, X)
(C.7)
The single extra box in the labels for the restricted Schur polynomial represents the aux-
iliary X ﬁeld. We can now, following the example we studied above, attach R1 and R2 to
diﬀerent corners and in this way obtain the delocalized single trace operator. For operators
that involve more than two corners, we would need to introduce more than one auxiliary
ﬁeld. Concretely, for the case we consider, we have
O(B)
A
=
X
R1,R2,r1,r2
a(A)
R1,R2,r1,r2 χ+(R1,R2),(+(r1
1,r1
2),
× )(Z, Y, X)
(C.8)
The notation
×
is just to reﬂect the fact that we have not organized the auxiliary ﬁelds
into representations of S2. We can now average over X in (C.8) to obtain an operator
that does not depend on the auxiliary ﬁelds. This averaging is easily performed using the
methods developed in [65]. It is straight forward, but tedious and messy, to check that
mixing between diﬀerent trace structures of these delocalized excitations is also suppressed.
Lets illustrate the above construction with the simplest possible example: we consider
two delocalized operators. The ﬁrst, OA, is given by placing Tr(Y ) at corner i and Tr(Y )
11Imagine that our operator is constructed using n Zs. The restricted Schur polynomials needed for this
computation involve restricting Sn+1 to Sn. There is no need for multiplicity labels when studying this
restriction.
– 33 –

JHEP07(2018)146
at corner j. The second, OB, is obtained by distributing Tr(Y 2) between the two corners.
When the background is not present, the relevant correlators are
⟨Tr(Y 2)(x1)Tr(Y †2)(x2)⟩=
2N2
|x1 −x2|4
⟨Tr(Y )2(x1)Tr(Y †)2(x2)⟩=
2N2
|x1 −x2|4
⟨Tr(Y )2(x1)Tr(Y †2)(x2)⟩=
2N
|x1 −x2|4
(C.9)
It is clear that the last correlator, which mixes diﬀerent trace structures, is down by a
factor of N. If we had normalized the two point functions to one, the last correlator above
vanishes at large N which shows that diﬀerent trace structures don’t mix. The delocalized
operator with Tr(Y ) at corner i and Tr(Y ) at corner j is obtained by adding a single box
at corner i of B and a single box at corner j. Denote the factor of the box added at corner
i by Neﬀ,1 and the factor of the box added at corner j by Neﬀ,2. It is a simple matter
to ﬁnd
⟨O(B)
A (x1)O(B)
A (x2)†⟩= ηB ˜ηB
Neﬀ,1Neﬀ,2
|x1 −x2|4
(C.10)
in complete agreement with (C.3). The coeﬃcient ηB ˜ηB is an order 1 number that arises
from computing the ratios of hooks. After averaging over the X ﬁelds we ﬁnd that O(B)
B (x2)
is a sum of two terms. One is clearly leading and has coeﬃcient
q
1 −
1
(Neﬀ,1−Neﬀ,2)2 . The
subleading term have coeﬃcient
1
Neﬀ,1−Neﬀ,2 . The leading term involves a twisted character
in the notation of [29], while the subleading term is a normal restricted character. We ﬁnd
that both terms contribute to the correlator
⟨O(B)
B (x1)O(B)
B (x2)†⟩= ηB ˜ηB
Neﬀ,1Neﬀ,2
|x1 −x2|4
(C.11)
while only the subleading term contributes to the mixed correlator
⟨O(B)
A (x1)O(B)
B (x2)†⟩= ηB ˜ηB
Neﬀ,1Neﬀ,2
(Neﬀ,1 −Neﬀ,2)|x1 −x2|4
(C.12)
Since Neﬀ,1−Neﬀ,2 is of order N, this clearly demonstrates the suppression. Although there
is little doubt that mixing between diﬀerent trace structures is suppressed for the general
delocalized excitations, at this point in time we do not have a simple general argument for
this conclusion.
D
Localized and delocalized mixing at one loop
In this appendix we study a simple example of mixing between a localized and a delocalzied
operator at one loop. Since we don’t want a selection rule to prevent the operators from
mixing, we need to consider operators that diﬀer in the placement of at most one box.
To make the computation as transparent as possible choose particularly simple operators.
– 34 –

JHEP07(2018)146
Our goal is to show that this mixing is of order N−1. This is a simple illustration that the
mixing between a delocalized operator and a local operator, is suppressed at large N.
The local operator that we consider is O+

,
)(Z, Y ). The representation
produces (+

for multiplicity labels. Lets assume that this excitation is localized at corner i. For the
delocalized operator, we assume that we have (
, (

)) at corner i and
, (·,
) at corner
j. For this example we can evaluate the matrix element (3.3) exactly. The result is

in perfect accord with the arguments of section 3.2.

Correcting the planar limit
The emergent gauge theory has ’t Hooft coupling g2
YMNeﬀwith g2
YM the coupling of the
original CFT. It is natural to ask if (non-planar) higher genus corrections are suppressed
by powers of N or powers of Neﬀ. This appendix gives a discussion of the issue.
The article [66] studied excitation of the annulus LLM background, with boundary
condition given by a single black annulus (of area N) with a central white disk (of area
M). The Young diagram describing this geometry has a total of N rows and M columns. A
simple and clean argument shows that the 1/2 BPS correlators, with excitations constructed
using only Z ﬁelds, admit an expansion with N−2
eﬀplaying the role of the genus counting
parameter [66]. In the 1/2 BPS sector, this result generalizes to multi ring geometries and
again the genus counting parameter is N−2
eﬀ.
To go beyond the half BPS sector the result (2.34) can be used. After rescaling the
ﬁelds which are not Z ﬁelds, by a factor of 1/√ηB, we ﬁnd a product of two terms
