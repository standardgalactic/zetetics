Managerialism: an ideal type

ABSTRACT
Managerialism pervades the higher education literature in much the same
way it is said to have pervaded universities themselves. Yet, despite its
ubiquity and importance, managerialism remains an under-theorized
and
elusive
concept
that
has
multiple
definitions
and
blurred
boundaries. This article addresses this lack of conceptual clarity by first
‘locating’
managerialism
in
relation
to
the
cognate
concepts
of
neoliberalism and New Public Management and then elucidating its core
principles in an ideal-type theoretical model. This ideal type provides a
focal point for theoretical debate and critique and, via the development
of empirical indicators for each ideological tenet, permits comparison of
theory with organizational practice. A worked example is provided of
how the model was used to shed light on the nature of managerialism
as ideology in a university setting. However, it is anticipated that the
model should have explanatory power and utility in a range of
organizational contexts.
KEYWORDS
Managerialism;
neoliberalism; New Public
Management; ideal type;
management theory
Managerialism is an increasingly prevalent modern-day phenomenon. Its influence is said to have
extended far beyond the organizational setting into economic, social, cultural and political spheres
and to have become so pervasive that it has ‘infiltrated every eventuality of human existence’
(Klikauer 2015, 1109). For Entemann (1993), it has become the predominant ideology of society. In
higher education, with the emergence of a more overt top-down corporate management approach,
managerialism is deemed to have ‘seeped into every “nook and cranny” of university life’ (Deem,
Hillyard, and Reed 2007, 27).
However, despite its importance and ubiquity, managerialism remains a slippery and under-
theorized concept (Klikauer 2015). There is no single agreed definition and, as Teelken (2012) illus-
trates, different authors assign it different meanings. Deem (1998), for example, emphasizes the
adoption of private sector practices and concerns, notably efficiency, effectiveness and excellence,
whilst Pollitt and Bouckaert (2000) highlight management reform and changes to structures and pro-
cesses. The difficulty of defining managerialism is compounded by blurred boundaries with cognate
concepts, such as New Public Management (NPM) and neoliberalism. Gordon and Whitchurch (2010)
conceive of managerialism in a higher education context as having six main characteristics:
.
A greater separation of academic work and management activity
.
Increased control and regulation of academic work by managers
.
A perceived shift in authority from academics to managers and consequent weakening of the pro-
fessional status of academics

.
An ethos of enterprise and emphasis on income generation
.
Government policy focused on universities meeting socio-economic needs
.
More market orientation, with increased competition for resources.
Whilst the first three relate closely to the ideological tenets of managerialism, the remaining three
arguably have their roots in neoliberalism (see Table 1). Deem, Hillyard, and Reed (2007, 9)
combine the two terms as ‘neoliberal managerialism’ which they identify as a variant of the ‘New
Managerialism’ they believe to have permeated universities.
Whilst the absence of a precise definition – and clear delineation between managerialism and
other closely related terms – is understandable, it is nevertheless problematic both for theorists
and those empirical researchers seeking to examine how managerialism is being played out in a uni-
versity context. For how are researchers to judge if they are encountering an example of manageri-
alism in practice if they lack a theoretical reference point that provides a standard of comparison? This
dilemma was the impetus for the development of the ideal type, or abstract theoretical model, of
managerialism presented in this article. In contrast to the ideal type developed by Barberis (2012),
which characterizes managerialism’s practical manifestations, this one focuses on its fundamental
principles.
The purpose of this ideal type is twofold. Firstly, to aid conceptual clarity by setting out the core
tenets of managerialism in a systematic and accessible way. Secondly, in so doing, to provide a mech-
anism to help empirical researchers link theory to the reality of organizational management practice.
In order to facilitate the latter, a worked example is provided that demonstrates how the model has
been used to shed light on the extent and nature of managerialism as ideology in one specific aspect
of university management: the appointment of executive team members. Before presenting this ideal
type, the term managerialism is first ‘located’ in relation to the cognate concepts of NPM and neoli-
beralism and then ‘bounded’ by differentiation from them.
Conceptual framework
Though closely related, managerialism and neoliberalism are in fact discrete phenomena. This section
provides a brief overview of each that explains their different origins and their relationship to each
other and that of NPM. In the conceptual framework proposed here, managerialism and neoliberal-
ism form the twin ideological pillars that underpin NPM.
NPM refers to a sustained set of reforms from the 1980s onwards that marked a shift away from
the traditional form of public administration (Hood 1991). These reforms were designed to give public
sector organizations a new orientation and, in so doing, change the way they operate. This has been
characterized as a transition from public sector administration to management (Lawler and Hearn

1995). As such, NPM represents a new paradigm in the provision of public services (Clarke, Gerwitz,
and McLaughlin 2000) that is radical in both its scope and intensity (Diefenbach 2009). That is not to
say that NPM is – or was – a single phenomenon or that it has not evolved over time (Ferlie et al.
1996). Indeed, it has been argued that NPM has now given way to New Public Governance
(Osborne 2006). Nevertheless, as Osborne observes, NPM represents a recognizable, if ultimately tran-
sitory, stage in the evolution of public administration and remains an established public adminis-
tration model (Glor 2001).
This NPM reform agenda was driven from the top across a wide range of public services over a
sustained period of time. However, there was no simple shift from public administration to NPM
and various phases, or variants, of NPM can be discerned. Ferlie et al. (1996), for example, identify
four distinct models: the efficiency drive, downsizing and decentralization, in search of excellence,
and public service orientation. Nevertheless, a number of typical characteristics of NPM reform can
be identified (Table 1).
Although NPM has been described as a ‘pot pourri of ideologies’ (Pollitt 1990, 46), Table 1 high-
lights how its practical manifestations are actually informed by two main ideological strands. The first
of these is the ideology of the New Right or, as it has been variously termed, new institutional econ-
omics, marketization or neoliberalism. The second is managerialism. Together these represent ‘a mar-
riage of two different streams of ideas’ that may or may not be fully compatible (Hood 1991, 5). These
broadly correspond to the two dimensions of NPM articulated by De Vries and Nemec (2013), that is,
the minimization of the role of the state in relation to society and attempts to improve the perform-
ance of the public sector. These two ideas underpinning NPM reforms are explored and compared
below.
Neoliberalism
Neoliberalism, or marketization, is an expression of economic liberalism that conceives of the world
as a marketplace and is concerned with opening up trade relations between countries on the basis of
free market principles (Maringe 2010). Neoliberals view markets as the most effective mechanism for
the distribution of money, goods and services. A free market economy is seen as facilitating economic
prosperity, whilst offering choice to consumers. From this perspective, neoliberalism is a form of
economic democracy that serves the public better than politics (Farnham and Horton 1996).
According to a neoliberal analysis, state intervention is an intrusion into the workings of the
market, distorting it by such means as monopoly provision, labour market regulation and taxation
(Clarke and Newman 1997). Markets rather than government plans were thus seen as the answer
to a bloated, unresponsive and inefficient public sector. Confidence in centralized government plan-
ning had waned by the 1980s and optimism about the benefits of an interventionist style of govern-
ment had largely disappeared. Margaret Thatcher was scornful of a ‘nanny-knows-best’ state (Pollitt
1990, 40) and chose to place her faith instead in freedom and free markets (Rhodes 1994).
Neoliberalism’s claim to legitimacy rests on the championing of the rights of the individual and the
promotion of freedom of choice (Ranson and Stewart 1994). Its core values are individualism and per-
sonal freedom rather than collectivism (Farnham and Horton 1996). Neoliberalism builds on public
choice theory with Nishkanen’s Bureaucracy and Representative Government (1971) particularly influ-
ential. He argued that the large size of public bureaucracies coupled with their monopoly status free
from the pressures of competition and performance indicators served to make them both inefficient
and ineffective. The remedy for these ills was to break them up into smaller units, open them up to
competition and introduce publicly available performance data (Boyne et al. 2003). Formal reporting
mechanisms were necessary to ensure accountability for public funds given that informal relations
based on trust alone were no longer deemed adequate (Power 1994).
Public choice theory is underpinned by a belief that people always act rationally, that is, according
to their own preferences, and in their own best interests (Flynn 2002). Whether or not this is always
true is open to dispute. Furthermore, the universalistic claim of public choice theory – that it is valid in
1670
S. SHEPHERD

all organizations and situations – has also been rejected as implausible (Boyne et al. 2003). The notion
of service user as consumer is not appropriate for some public services, such as health and education,
and a consumer focus may come at the expense of the interests of the wider community (Ranson and
Stewart 1994). Equally, the concept of a market may not be applicable within the public sector (or in
higher education) and many so-called markets are only provider-markets or quasi-markets. Despite
these criticisms, neoliberalism is said to have become hegemonic, masquerading as ‘the only accep-
table reality’ (Vincent 2011, 333).
Although, as illustrated in Table 1, both neoliberalism and managerialism inform NPM reform, they
have very different characteristics and histories. Whereas the former is individualistic, the latter has
the organization as its basic social unit (Entemann 1993). Neoliberalism is primarily concerned
with economics and has a definite political program, whereas managerial techniques underpin man-
agerialism, which holds that all problems have managerial solutions (Klikauer 2015). This fundamental
difference between the two emphasizes their different backgrounds: neoliberalism emanates from
economics and managerialism from management theory. Accordingly, the guiding principle of neo-
liberalism is the free market, while that of managerialism is management itself.
Managerialism
In essence, managerialism can be conceived of as the pursuit of a set of management ideas (Flynn
2002). As such it represents a certain worldview or ideology, where the latter is taken to mean a
‘consistent integrated pattern of thoughts and beliefs explaining man’s attitude towards life and his
existence in society, and advocating a conduct and action pattern responsive to and commensurate
with such thoughts and beliefs’ (Lowenstein 1953, 52). Thus conceived, an ideology is action-oriented,
intended both to influence opinion and to justify and legitimate a course of action (Gerring 1997). Man-
agerialism is the belief system of arguably the dominant group in an organization: managers. It is
enacted by managers, or management, systematically embedding themselves in an organization
and is propagated and legitimated by the teaching of business schools (Barberis 2012).
Managerialism focuses on the interests of management – and the role of individual managers – in
how organizations are managed (Lawler and Hearn 1995). It is self-evidently in the interests of man-
agers to promote managerialism, which has at its core management’s special contribution, rights and
powers (Klikauer 2015). Managers are the main supporters – and beneficiaries – of managerialism
since it increases their social status and strengthens their organizational position. Given that manage-
rialism serves their particular interests, managers may use the mantra of good management practice
to justify their own autonomy in much the same way academics cite academic freedom (Pollitt 1990).
As an ideology, managerialism can be compared to professionalism in that both are normative
systems concerning what counts as valuable knowledge, who knows it and who is empowered to
act in what way as a consequence (Clarke, Gerwitz, and McLaughlin 2000). Clarke et al. describe
the process of putting managerial ideas into practice as managerialization. This is achieved via the
application of specific techniques or ‘control technologies’ in the form of practical measures (such
as target setting or performance management), new organizational structures or propaganda and
persuasion designed to effect cultural change (Deem, Hillyard, and Reed 2007, 14).
Its description as an ideology does not necessarily imply a close connection between the ideas of
managerialism and that of any specific political party. The implementation of managerialism was
not just the work of determined New Right advocates. Rather, a number of diverse interests may
have been involved, including those who felt they had no choice or who believed they may
benefit. Moreover, although managerialism has been seen as a by-product of New Right ideas,
its founding principles precede those of the New Right. Just as neoliberalism has its roots in
public choice theory, so managerialism emanates from FW Taylor’s scientific school of management
(1911). Early examples of managerialism are therefore often described as neo-Taylorist. However,
over the years, its ideas have evolved in line with developments in management thinking, including
excellence, change management and cultural approaches (Peters and Waterman 1982; Burnes 1992;
STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
1671

Handy 1993). These management ideas are said to have ‘mutated’ into managerialism under the
following formula:
Management + Ideology + Expansion = Managerialism. (Klikauer 2015, 1105)
Its inﬂuence has become widespread and has permeated the thinking of many, if not most, organ-
izations. In fact, managerialism has extended beyond the organizational realm. For Klikauer, it has
become such an all-encompassing force that he ﬁnds it near impossible to think of an area of
society that is not governed by it or to envisage anything that might cause it to disappear.
Indeed, he describes managerialism’s effects as akin to ‘ideological enslavement and asphyxiation’
(2015, 1114). Klikauer is not alone in viewing managerialism as a powerful and pervasive force. Ente-
mann, for example, considers it to have become ‘the basic principle’ of advanced industrial societies
and symptomatic of ‘deep social change’ (1993, 156).
Unlike in the private sector where managerialism was market driven, in the public sector it has been
politically driven (Clarke and Newman 1997). This places the onus on public sector managers to carry
out public policy as agents of change (Farnham and Horton 1996). For example, in the UK’s National
Health Service (NHS), a new cadre of general managers were used to introduce management levers
such as value for money reviews (Ferlie et al. 1996). From this perspective, managerialism can be
seen as the means by which a fundamentally political project like NPM has been implemented
(Newman 2000). It may therefore be conceived as the ‘organisational arm of neoliberalism’ (Lynch
2014, 968), creating a new management orthodoxy for the running of the public sector by applying
the management model of the business world (Ward 2011). In so doing, it has provided an apparently
managerial solution to what were previously conceived of as political problems (Pollitt 1990).
An ideal-type model of managerialism
The ideal-type, first developed and used by Max Weber in relation to capitalism and bureaucracy,
can serve as a useful means of synthesizing and organizing abstract ideas in a coherent and acces-
sible way. This process inevitably necessitates a degree of selection and simplification that fails to
convey the entirety or complexity of a phenomenon. However, an ideal type is purely an intellectual
tool or heuristic device which cannot, and should not, claim to depict reality. It is rather an abstrac-
tion of reality, expressed in ‘purest imaginable form, almost as a caricature’ (Barberis 2012, 331) that
allows it to capture the essential elements of a phenomenon. Although reductionist in nature and
representing a fixed state or point in time, this very fixity means that it can serve as an unchanging
marker against which to compare the changing empirical world (Friedson 2001). When used as a
standard of comparison, an ideal type enables us to see the world in a clearer and more systematic
way.
With this aim in mind, this section presents an ideal-type theoretical model of managerialism
derived from the literature (Pollitt 1990; Hood 1991; Farnham and Horton 1996; Clarke and Newman
1997; Clarke, Gerwitz, and McLaughlin 2000; Pollitt 2003; Klikauer 2015). It comprises five core ideologi-
cal tenets, or claims, outlined in turn below. In addition, there is a sixth claim that applies specifically to
managerialism in a public sector context, that is, a belief in the superiority of private sector methods. It is
important to note that these tenets are normative rather than descriptive and reflect the way things
should be from a managerial perspective rather than the way they necessarily are. This ideal type is
therefore not intended as an ideological defence of managerialism. Instead, it is anticipated that it
may serve as a focal point for critique – which is beyond the scope and purpose of this article – and
as ‘a clear target for criticism and revision’ as a theoretical model (Friedson 2001, 5).
(1) Management is important and a good thing: The fundamental premise of managerialism is that
management is both the optimal form of organizational governance (Deem, Hillyard, and Reed 2007)
and the main vehicle for organizational success. The argument goes that, if only things were better
managed, improved performance would inevitably follow. By this token, effective management
should lead to the elimination of red tape and inefficiency, the establishment of clear objectives, a
1672
S. SHEPHERD

highly motivated workforce and demonstrable results. To proponents of managerialism, manage-
ment is thus ‘an optimistic, almost a romantic creed’ (Pollitt 1990, 1).
Managerialism holds that management is not only important, but also a good thing: a progressive
social force with the capacity to solve a range of economic and social ills. More and better manage-
ment should provide the means by which individual organizations can thrive and the UK economy
become more globally competitive and successful (Clarke and Newman 1997). It is therefore indis-
pensable to the achievement of economic, technological and social progress (Deem, Hillyard, and
Reed 2007). Underpinning this aspect of managerialism is the belief that economic growth is the
main route to social prosperity (Pollitt 1990).
(2) Management is a discrete function: In the late nineteenth century, a new group interposed itself
between owners and workers: the supervisors responsible for the efficient running of the organiz-
ation and the maximization of profit for the shareholder owners. From this group emerged a new
cadre of trained professional managers (Ward 2011). Scientific management, from which manageri-
alism derives, was predicated on the assumption that increased surveillance by these managers
would improve worker productivity. This would be achieved by reducing tasks to their component
parts, measuring work processes and controlling and rewarding effort. It is an elitist view of manage-
ment in that it is based on a philosophy of separating the conception and execution of tasks, or think-
ing from doing (Broadbent, Dietrich, and Roberts 1997), with workers defined as unthinking and
following orders. By implication, managers are the management, that is, a group separate from
those doing the work (Flynn 2002) and often remote from the day-to-day functioning of the organ-
ization. This very remoteness supports the notion of a professional management in possession of a
generic body of knowledge sufficiently removed from the technical specifics that it is transferable
from organization to organization (Entemann 1993).
The main purpose of management is seen as undertaking the strategic decision-making that
enables an organization to achieve its stated purpose (Ranson and Stewart 1994). The discretion
to plan and make strategic decisions gives management its distinctive role in organizations, whilst
the requisite processes of analysis and strategic choice have intellectualized and professionalized
it (Entemann 1993). Managers are able to justify themselves on the grounds of their superior
know-how, and their skills and competencies are viewed as critical to organizational survival and
success (Farnham and Horton 1996). This reflects the prioritization of management as a discrete func-
tion and the creation of a management class with real organizational power (Lynch 2014).
(3) Management is rational and value neutral: Due to its origins in scientific management theory,
managerialism places great faith in the management activities of planning and objective setting
as a means of improving performance (Farnham and Horton 1996). The decision-making process
that underpins these core management functions is perceived as entirely logical and rational: man-
agers define the problem, gather relevant data, develop possible solutions, evaluate them and decide
on the best course of action. The process is also rational in the sense that the application of what is
regarded as superior intelligence via scientific method is inevitably deemed to lead to optimal
decisions (Taylor 1911). By these means, managers are able to constantly refine and improve organ-
izational performance.
From this perspective, management practice is essentially technical and value neutral, offering a
non-partisan framework within which decisions can be made away from the partisan claims of par-
ticular interest groups (Clarke and Newman 1997). Accordingly, managers are neutral professionals
who can be trusted to manage in an impersonal way and in the organization’s best interests. Manage-
rialism therefore holds that organizations can only function effectively if decision-making is centra-
lized in the hands of professional and objective managers (Ward 2011). More broadly, the whole
notion of managerialism is presented as value neutral and its management principles as unques-
tioned, common-sense truths (Klikauer 2015).
(4) Management is generic and universally applicable: Managerialism also echoes scientific manage-
ment in its espousal of the systematic nature and universal applicability of management. Taylor
(1911) holds that anything can and should be managed and that management practice in one
STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
1673

arena is transferable to another. This approach to management theory could be characterized as
management is management regardless of where it is practised (Kottler 1981). It views management
as a generic set of activities common to all organizations, with managers performing fundamentally
the same tasks whatever sector they are in (Ranson and Stewart 1994). For advocates of manageri-
alism, there is little difference between the skills required to run an oil rig or a university (Klikauer
2015).
Underpinning managerialism, then, are the twin beliefs that organizations are more similar than
different, and that the performance of any type of organization can be enhanced by the application
of generic management skills (Klikauer 2015). This belief in a generic model of management practice
that minimizes the differences between the public and private sector (Dixon, Kouzmin, and Korac-
Kakabadse 1998) has been one of the key drivers of public sector reform (Pollitt 1990). Accordingly,
there has been considerable convergence between the management of the two sectors since the
early 1980s, with the language and techniques of business now commonplace throughout the
public sector (Farnham and Horton 1996). The 1983 Griffiths Report which introduced general man-
agement into the NHS was one manifestation of the government’s faith in generic management skills
applicable across a range of public and private sector organizations (Exworthy and Halford 1999).
(5) Managers must have the right to manage: A key ideological demand of managerialism is that
managers should be granted the right to manage, that is, the discretion to undertake the manage-
ment functions of planning and decision-making, coordination and monitoring (Entemann 1993).
This necessitates that managers assume some formal authority and undertake specific management
activities to direct the work of others. Although they may lack the particular knowledge, skills and
experience to perform that work themselves, they claim ‘competence to command’ based on a
form of general knowledge that is superior to specialization (Friedson 2001, 115). Thus, experience
and skills pertinent to the organization’s core business are considered secondary to those of man-
agers whose advanced knowledge and know-how is deemed essential to the effective functioning
of an organization (Klikauer 2015).
Since management can only be undertaken by managers, this gives them control over those who
do the work. Managerialism is therefore accompanied by the belief that managers must be in control
and exercise their authority over the managed. Accordingly, the workforce are accountable to man-
agers, rather than the other way around (Smith and Hussey 2010). The assumption is that individual
managers can and do make a real difference to organizations and impose their personalities upon
them (Entemann 1993). With the development of culture and excellence management approaches,
the image of managers has been transformed from that of ‘dull organizational time servers’ to ‘entre-
preneurial and inspirational change agents’ (Clarke and Newman 1997, 35).
(6) Private sector methods are superior: Managerialism in the public sector is based on the belief
that management practices in the private sector are inherently superior and need to be adopted if
the efficiency and performance of public services – and universities – are to be improved (Dixon,
Kouzmin, and Korac-Kakabadse 1998). Indeed, managerialism is said to have ‘announced the con-
ditions of its own necessity’ through an articulation of all that was wrong with previous public
sector management in comparison to that of the private sector (Clarke and Newman 1997). The
importation of private sector practice and business methods is therefore an essential characteristic
of managerialism in a public sector context – so much so that its use in support of NPM has been
described as a ‘covert form of privatization’ (Farnham and Horton 1996, 263).
The ideal type in practice
This section demonstrates how this ideal type might be utilized by empirical researchers wishing to
investigate how the realities of management practice in organizations relate to and reflect manage-
rialism as an ideology. It does so by means of a worked example of its use in doctoral research into the
appointment of deputy and pro vice-chancellors (PVCs) in pre-1992 English universities (Shepherd
2015). This mixed methods research utilized three distinct data collection sources and methods.
1674
S. SHEPHERD

These comprised a census of all PVCs within these institutions, based on publicly available data (pri-
marily from university websites) designed to provide a snapshot in time of the demographic and pro-
fessional profile of the entire cohort. An online survey was also conducted of both academic and
professional services third-tier managers, that is, at the level immediately below PVC, to investigate
their aspirations and agency with regard to becoming a PVC. Finally, over 70 semi-structured inter-
views were conducted with:
.
Vice-chancellors
.
Registrars
.
PVCs appointed via external open competition
.
Academic and professional services third-tier managers
.
Executive search agents.
One of the aims of this research was to subject the prevailing academic narrative, which asserts that
managerialism has pervaded universities, to critical examination. More specifically, it sought to under-
stand the extent to which the introduction of an open external competition model of PVC appoint-
ments might be considered symptomatic of managerialism.
The first step in the process was to devise the ideal-type theoretical model. Secondly, empirical indi-
cators were developed for the model’s six ideological tenets designed to show what form each might
take in relation to changing PVC appointment practice. Even though some of these indicators could
apply to more than one tenet, in order to avoid repetition, the decision was made to associate them
with only one (Table 2). Thirdly, the research findings (predominantly data from semi-structured inter-
views) were analysed in order to evaluate the extent of the evidence in support of each of these empiri-
cal indicators. A detailed presentation of the research data is beyond the remit of this article, but the
headline findings are given in column 3 and summarized below.
As Table 2 illustrates, there is significant evidence to support two of the ideological tenets of man-
agerialism: that management is important and a good thing (1) and managers must have the right to
manage (5). Whereas, until relatively recently the legitimacy of management in higher education was
questioned not only by the managed, but also by those who occupied management positions
(McCaffery 2004), these findings show that vice-chancellors and PVCs now appear to have fully
accepted the idea that university management is both necessary and beneficial. This is reflected in
the perceived importance of the PVC role and of making the right appointment. Widespread

acceptance of the need for effective university management, coupled with a hierarchical manage-
ment approach more dependent on positional power have led to an increasing expectation that
PVCs should have the right to manage. Furthermore, the trend towards a full-time managerial con-
ception of the PVC role, and the legitimation of academic management as a career have all increased
the likelihood that PVCs will be willing to assume that right.
There is also growing evidence that management is becoming a discrete function (2) within
universities especially with respect to the criteria for, and construction of, the PVC role. Academic
management experience is seen as increasingly important and many PVCs appointed via external
open competition are not only engaged full time in management, but have also embarked upon
an academic management career track with little or no intention of going back to an academic
role (Shepherd 2014). They are largely divorced from day-to-day academic work, leading to an
increased separation of management and frontline academic activity. Moreover, as they have increas-
ingly assumed responsibility for strategic thinking and planning, the gap between them and the staff
carrying out the work has widened. The result has been that management has emerged as a ‘distinc-
tive social group’ with its own interests (Deem and Brehony 2005, 231).
Support for the notion of the superiority of private sector methods (6) is mixed. Private sector
methods, such as the use of executive search agencies, are increasingly being adopted for PVC
appointments – and more widely for other senior university management posts. In addition, specialist
managers are being recruited from other sectors to run professional services functions. However,
when it comes to PVC appointments, private sector experience is deemed neither relevant nor valid.
Overall, the analysis reveals that ideal-type managerialism is not as pervasive as the academic nar-
rative might suggest with respect to PVC appointment practice. Furthermore, the findings raised
questions about the viability of managerialism’s ideological claim that management is generic and
universally applicable (4). Rather, what the study found was a context-specific variant of managerial-
ism rather than the generic ideal type. In relation to PVC appointments, there was a strong sense of
the uniqueness of universities as organizations and virtually no recognition of the transferability of
management skills and experience from other sectors or occupational groups. Professional services
managers within higher education are not regarded as credible candidates and PVCs remain almost
exclusively career academics. The evidence thus reflects a higher education-specific form of manage-
rial ideology that might be described as ‘academic-managerialism’.
Moreover, in terms of PVC appointments, managerialism’s assertion that management is rational
and value neutral (3) was not supported. In reality, the appointment process was characterized by
social closure in relation to other occupational groups and micro-politics in the form of the mainten-
ance of self-interest, power and status. Given that the recruitment and selection process in other
organizations – and indeed any example of management decision-making – is likely to be subject
to similar influences, this casts doubt on the validity of managerialism’s wider ideological claim for
the rationality and neutrality of management and managers.
This example illustrates how the ideal type fulfils two complementary functions. On the one hand,
it serves as a benchmark against which to compare organizational realities and, on the other hand, it
acts as a focal point for critique of managerialism’s core tenets in the light of the empirical findings. It
is thus anticipated that this ideal type should have explanatory power in relation to other aspects of
organizational practice, for example the introduction of performance management, in universities –
and elsewhere.
Summary
This article has contributed to the literature in three ways. Firstly, it ‘locates’ managerialism in relation
to NPM and neoliberalism and, in an attempt to delineate its boundaries, differentiates it from them.
Secondly, it synthesizes ideas from the public administration literature in the form of an ideal-type
theoretical model of managerialism comprising an accessible and systematic framework of its core
principles, or tenets. Thirdly, it provides a worked example of how, via the development of empirical

indicators for each of these tenets, the ideal-type model can be used to aid researchers seeking to
understand how managerialism is being enacted in an organizational context.
By these means, it is anticipated that this ideal type will aid researchers seeking to understand how
managerialism is being enacted in universities and other organizational contexts and thus have prac-
tical utility for future empirical research as well as explanatory power at a theoretical level. At
minimum, it should contribute to the debate by serving as a target for criticism as a model of man-
agerialism’s fundamental principles.
