 This presentation reviews Chandra's major contribution to the
 understanding of nearby galaxies. After a brief summary on signif
 icant advances in characterizing various types of discrete x-ray
 sources, the presentation focuses on the global hot gas in and
 around galaxies, especially normal ones like our own. The hot
 gas is a product of stellar and active galactic nuclear feedback?
 the least understood part in theories of galaxy formation and evo
 lution. Chandra observations have led to the first characterization
 of the spatial, thermal, chemical, and kinetic properties of the gas
 in our galaxy. The gas is concentrated around the galactic bulge
 and disk on scales of a few kiloparsec The column density of
 chemically enriched hot gas on larger scales is at least an order
 magnitude smaller, indicating that it may not account for the bulk
 of the missing baryon matter predicted for the galactic halo accord
 ing to the standard cosmology. Similar results have also been
 obtained for other nearby galaxies. The x-ray emission from hot
 gas is well correlated with the star formation rate and stellar mass,
 indicating that the heating is primarily due to the stellar feedback.
 However, the observed x-ray luminosity of the gas is typically
 less than a few percent of the feedback energy. Thus the bulk
 of the feedback (including injected heavy elements) is likely lost
 in galaxy-wide outflows. The results are compared with simula
 tions of the feedback to infer its dynamics and interplay with
 the circumgalactic medium, hence the evolution of galaxies.
 feedback | simulation | x-ray source | hot gas
 X-ray observations are playing an increasingly important role
 in the study of galaxies. With its arcsecond spatial resolution,
 Chandra in particular has made a significant impact on our
 understanding of discrete x-ray source populations, which mostly
 represent various stellar end products [e.g., low- and high-mass
 x-ray binaries (LMXBs and HMXBs) and supernova remnants
 (SNRs)] as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resolution
 also allows for a clean excision of such sources from the data so
 low-surface brightness emission (e.g., from diffuse hot gas) can be
 mapped out. An underappreciated aspect of Chandra is its
 spectroscopic capability in the study of diffuse hot gas when
 the low- and high-energy grating instruments are used. Although
 the sensitivities of the instruments are quite limited, the existing
 observations of a dozen or so bright objects (AGN and LMXBs)
 have yielded data of high enough quality for unprecedented x-ray
 absorption line spectroscopic measurements of the global hot gas
 in and around our galaxy. Useful constraints have also been ob
 tained on the overall content of hot gas around galaxies within
 certain impact distances of the sight lines toward the AGN. These
 measurements, compared with physical models and simulations
 of the hot gas, are shedding important insights on its relationship
 to the feedback from stars and AGN. These aspects of Chandra's
 legacy are reviewed in the following.
 Discrete Sources
 The overall x-ray luminosity of a galaxy (except for a giant
 elliptical) is usually dominated by HMXBs and/or LMXBs.
 The luminosity functions of HMXBs and LMXBs are linearly
 scaled with the star formation rate and the stellar mass of a galaxy
 and are universal to an accuracy better than ~50% and 30%, re
 spectively (1, 2). The differential power law slope of the function
 for HMXBs is a 1.6 over a broad range of log(Lx) ~ 35.5-40.5,
 where Lx is the luminosity in the 0.5-2 keV band. Particularly in
 teresting are a large number of non-AGN (hyper)ultraluminous
 x-ray sources with log(L^) in the range of -39.5-41.5 and
 observed typically in active star-forming galaxies, suggesting
 the presence of either so-called intermediate-mass black holes
 (10<MBH<105) or sources apparently radiating well above
 the Eddington limit. The luminosity function shape for LMXBs
 is a bit more complicated, having a slope of ?1 at log^) < 37.5,
 steepening gradually at higher luminosities and cutting off
 abruptly at log(Lx) - 39.0-39.5. Furthermore, the frequency of
 LMXBs per stellar mass is substantially higher in globular clusters
 than in galaxy field [e.g., ref. 3). This is attributed to the forma
 tion of LMXBs via close stellar encounters, which has also been
 proposed to account for an enhanced number of LMXBs in the
 dense inner bulge of M 31 (4). But it is not yet clear as to what
 fraction of field LMXBs was formed dynamically (e.g., refs. 5, 6).
 For the study of diffuse hot gas, it is important to minimize the
 confusion from point-like source contributions. A source detec
 tion limit at least down to log(Lx) - 37 is highly desirable, which
 can be achieved with a Chandra observation of a reasonably deep
 exposure for nearby galaxies (D < 20 Mpc). The residual contri
 bution from fainter HMXBs and LMXBs can then be estimated
 from their correlation with the star formation rate and stellar
 mass and subtracted from the data with little uncertainty. How
 ever, one still needs to be careful with Poisson fluctuations of
 sources just below the detection limit. Such fluctuations may
 significantly affect the reliability of x-ray morphological analysis
 of a galaxy.
 In addition to the subtraction of relatively bright x-ray binaries,
 one also needs to account for a significant (even dominant) stellar
 contribution from cataclysmic variables and coronally active
 stars, which are numerous, though individually faint. Very deep
 Chandra imaging of a region toward the Milky Way bulge (7) has
 resolved out more than 80% of the background emission at en
 ergies of 6-7 keV, where the observed prominent Fe 6.7-keV line
 was thought as the evidence for the presence of diffuse hot plas
 ma at T - 108 K. This high-energy background emission is now
 shown to be entirely consistent with this collective stellar contri
 bution in the galactic bulge/ridge. It should be noted, however,
 that the resolved fraction is much smaller at lower energies
 (-50% at <4 keV), which may be considered as an indication
 for the presence of diffuse hot gas at much lower temperatures.
 The stellar contribution is unresolved for external galaxies, even
 nearby ones. Fortunately, the average x-ray spectrum and specific
 luminosity (per stellar mass) of the contribution have been
 calibrated, based on the Chandra observations of M32, which
 is too light to hold significant amount of diffuse hot gas, together
 with the direct detection of stellar x-ray sources in the solar
 neighborhood (8). The contribution can be readily included in
 a spectral analysis of the "diffuse" x-ray emission of a galaxy.
 In an imaging analysis, one may subtract the contribution scaled

 according to the stellar mass distribution (e.g., traced by the near
 IR K-band intensity of a galaxy).
 Global Hot Gas in and Around Our Galaxy
 The properties of the global hot gas on scales comparable to
 the size of our galaxy remained largely unknown until recently.
 Before Chandra, we did have various broadband x-ray emission
 surveys of the sky such as the one made by ROSAT in the
 0.1-2.4 keV range, which is sensitive to the hot gas (9). But such
 a survey alone cannot be used to directly determine the origin of
 the x-ray emission, which carries little distance information. The
 interpretation of the emission depends sensitively on the assumed
 cool (x-ray-absorbing) and hot gas distributions. Spectroscopic in
 formation on the x-ray emission has been obtained from rocket
 experiments (10) and more recently from Suzaku observations,
 but only for a number of sample regions (e.g., ref. 11). There
 are also large uncertainties in the contributions from faint dis
 crete sources and other irrelevant phenomena such as solar wind
 charge exchange (SWCX) to the emission.
 A breakthrough for the study of the global hot gas has been
 made from the use of the x-ray absorption line spectroscopy
 (e.g., refs. 12-20). Although absorption line spectroscopy is com
 monly used in optical and UV studies of the interstellar medium
 (ISM), this technique became feasible in the soft x-ray regime
 only with grating spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton.
 Unlike the emission, which is sensitive to the density structure,
 absorption lines produced by ions such as O VII, O VIII, and
 Ne IX (Fig. 1) directly probe their column densities, which are
 proportional to the mass of the hot gas. The relative strengths
 of such absorption lines give direct diagnostics of the thermal,
 chemical, and/or kinetic properties of the hot gas. Although
 the absorption lines are rarely resolved in the spectra (with a
 resolution of -400-500 kms-1 FWHM), the velocity dispersion
 of the hot gas can be derived from the relative line saturation
 of different transitions of same ion species (e.g., O VII Ka vs.
 Kp). Because the K-shell transitions of carbon through iron
 are all in the x-ray regime, the same technique can be used to
 study the ISM in essentially all phases (cold, warm, and hot)
 and forms [atomic, molecular, and dust grain; (16)]. Furthermore,
 the measurements are insensitive to the photoelectric absorption
 by the cool ISM (kT < 104 K) and to the SWCX. Therefore, the
 x-ray absorption line spectroscopy allows us to probe the global
 ISM unbiasedly along a sight line. The effectiveness of the
 technique can be further enhanced when multiple sight lines
 are analyzed jointly (e.g., ref. 18) and/or emission data are in
 cluded (e.g., ref. 19). We can then infer differential properties
 of hot gas between sight lines of different depths or directions
 and/or estimate the path length and density of the hot gas.

 This basic characterization demonstrates the potential of
 using the x-ray tomography to greatly advance our understanding
 of the global hot gas in and around the galaxy.
 Global Hot Gas in and Around Other Galaxies
 The x-ray absorption line spectroscopy can also be used to probe
 the hot CGM around other galaxies. Yao et al. 24 have recently
 studied the hot CGM along the sight lines toward luminous AGN.
 As an example, Fig. 2 shows a Chandra grating spectrum of PKS
 2155-304. No absorption line is apparent at the redshifts of the
 three groups of galaxies with the impact distances smaller than
 500 kpc of the sight line (in particular, the group at the highest
 redshift contains two galaxies brighter than L*). The same is true
 when the spectrum is folded according to the redshifts of the in
 dividual groups. To increase the counting statistics further, Yao et
 al. have stacked spectra from the Chandra grating observations of

 eight AGN with such intervening galaxies or groups. No signifi
 cant absorption is detected for any of these individual systems or
 in the final stacked spectrum with a total equivalent exposure of
 about 10 Ms. Upper limits to the mean column densities of
 various ion species per galaxy or group are then estimated. In
 particular, they find that NQ vn < 6 x 1014 cm-2, consistent with
 the constraints for the CGM around our galaxy. They have
 estimated the total mass contained in the CGM as
 where/o vii,A, and R are the ionization fraction of O VII, metal
 abundance, and the radius of the hot CGM, respectively. This is
 in contrast to the expected baryon mass >2x 10nMo for the
 halo of a Milky-Way-type galaxy or a typical galaxy group (25).
 Thus the bulk of the CGM unlikely resides in such a chemically
 enriched warm-hot phase at temperatures ranging from
 105 5-106 5 K (Fig. 1), to which our x-ray absorption line spectro
 scopy is sensitive. This conclusion has strong implications for
 understanding the accumulated effect of the stellar and AGN
 feedback on the galactic ecosystem (see Discussion).
 To study the effect of ongoing stellar and AGN feedback, one
 can map out diffuse x-ray emission from hot gas in and around
 nearby galaxies of various masses and star formation rates. Much
 attention has been paid to the feedback in starburst and massive
 elliptical galaxies, which are relatively bright in diffuse x-ray emis
 sion. Chandra observations have shown convincingly that the
 AGN feedback is important in shaping the morphology and ther
 mal evolution of hot gas in massive elliptical galaxies, particularly
 those at centers of galaxy groups and clusters (ref. 26 and refer
 ences therein). The asymmetry in the global diffuse x-ray morphol
 ogy is correlated with radio and x-ray luminosities of AGN in
 elliptical galaxies, even in rather x-ray-faint ones (27). This calls
 into question the hydrostatic assumption commonly used in order
 to infer the gravitational mass distribution in such galaxies. Never
 theless, the hydrostatic assumption may hold approximately for
 hot gas around the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
 if they are in a sufficiently quiescent state. The SMBH masses
 may then be measured from spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopy
 of the hot gas. Humphrey et al. have made such mass measure
 ments for four SMBHs with Chandra data (28). Three of them al
 ready have mass determinations from the kinematics of either stars
 or a central gas disk. It is encouraging to find a good agreement
 between the measurements using the different methods. From this
 agreement, they further infer that no more than -10-20% of the
 ISM pressure around the SMBHs should be nonthermal.
 The feedback in nuclear starburst galaxies is manifested in the
 so-called galactic superwinds driven by the mechanical energy in
 jection from fast stellar winds and supernovae (SNe) of massive
 stars (e.g., refs. 29-31). The observed soft x-ray emission from a
 superwind typically has an elongated morphology along the minor
 axis of such a galaxy and is correlated well with extraplanar
 Hot-emitting features. This indicates that the detected hot gas
 arises primarily from the interaction between the superwind
 and cool gas. The superwind itself, believed to be very hot and
 low in density, is much difficult to detect. From a detailed com
 parison between Chandra data and hydrodynamic simulations,
 Strickland and Heckman infer that the superwind of M82 has
 a mean temperature of 3-8 x 107 K and a mass outflowing rate
 of ~2MQ yr-1 (31). Such energetic superwinds with little radia
 tive energy loss must have profound effects on the large-scale
 CGM (e.g., ref. 30).
 Recent x-ray observations have further shown the importance
 of the feedback in understanding even "normal" intermediate
 mass galaxies (similar to the Milky Way and M31; e.g., refs. 29,
 30, 32-40). Chandra, in particular, has unambiguously detected
 diffuse hot gas in and around normal disk galaxies. The total
 x-ray luminosity of the gas is well correlated with the star forma
 tion rate for such galaxies. The diffuse soft x-ray emission is
 shown to be strongly enhanced in recent star-forming regions
 or spiral arms within an individual galaxy viewed face-on and
 is only slightly more diffuse than Ha emission (e.g., refs. 33, 34).
 This narrow appearance of spiral arms in x-ray conflicts the expec
 tation from population synthesis models: The mechanical energy
 output rate from SNe should be nearly constant over a time period
 that is up to 10 times longer than the lifetime of massive ionizing
 stars. This means that SNe in interarm regions, where ISM density
 is generally low, must produce less soft x-ray emission than those
 in the arms. When disk galaxies are observed in an inclined angle
 (e.g., Fig. 3), the soft x-ray emission tends to appear as plumes,
 most likely representing blown-out hot gas heated in recent
 massive star-forming regions and galactic spheroids. The cleanest
 perspectives of the extraplanar hot gas are obtained from the ob
 servations of edge-on disk galaxies such as NGC 891 (29) and
 NGC 5775 (38). The observed diffuse x-ray emission typically does
 not extend significantly more than a few kiloparsec away from
 the galactic disks. A claimed detection of the emission around
 the edge-on spiral NGC 5746 on larger scales was later proved
 to be due to an instrumental artifact (41). Complementary
 observations from XMM-Newton and Suzaku give consistent re
 sults and provide improved spectral information on the hot gas
 (e.g., refs. 35,36,40,42,43). The morphology of the x-ray emission
 as well as its correlation with the star formation rate clearly shows
 that the extraplanar hot gas is primarily heated by the stellar
 feedback. In fact, the radiative cooling of the hot gas accounts
 for only a small fraction of the expected energy input from massive
 stars alone (typically no more than a few percent).
 The best example of mapping out hot gas in a galactic stellar
 bulge (or spheroid) is the discovery of an apparent hot gas out
 flow from the M31 bulge (37, 39). This outflow with a 0.5-2 keV

 luminosity of ~2 x 1038 ergs-1 is driven apparently by the feed
 back from evolved stars in form of stellar mass loss and (Type)
 la SNe, because there is no evidence for an AGN or recent mas
 sive star formation in the bulge. The bipolar morphology of the
 truly diffuse soft x-ray emission further indicates that the outflow
 is probably influenced by the presence of strong vertical magnetic
 field, same as that observed in the central region of our galaxy.
 The spectrum of the emission can be characterized by an optically
 thin thermal plasma with a temperature of -3 x 106 K (37, 39,
 44). Similar analyses have been carried out so far only for a cou
 ple of other early-type galaxies [NGC 3379, (45); NGC 5866,
 (46)]. The faint stellar contribution, which has a significantly
 different spectral shape from LMXBs, still needs to be carefully
 accounted for in the analysis of other galaxies. In any case, it is
 clear that the diffuse x-ray luminosity accounts for at most a few
 percent of the energy input from la SNe alone in a normal early
 type galaxy. Where does the missing feedback go?
 Another remarkable puzzle about the diffuse hot gas in ellip
 tical galaxies is the apparent low metal abundances. As inferred
 from x-ray spectral fits, the abundances are typically subsolar for
 low- and intermediate-mass galaxies with log^) < 41 to about
 solar for more massive ones (e.g., refs. 47, 48), substantially less
 than what are expected from the la SN enrichment (see Discus
 sion). Furthermore, a number of galaxies show a significant iron
 abundance drop toward their central regions, where the stellar
 feedback should be the strongest. Examples of this abundance
 drop include M87 (49), NGC 4472, NGC 5846 (50), and NGC
 5044 (51). The drop and the low abundance, if intrinsic, would
 then indicate that only a small portion of metals produced by
 la SNe is observed; the rest is either expelled or in a state that
 the present x-ray data are not sensitive to.
 In summary, the following are the key discoveries made with
 Chandra observations of the diffuse hot gas:
 The hot gas generally consists of two components: (/) the disk
 component, which is sensitive to the star formation rate per
 unit area (e.g., refs. 30, 38, 43, 52); (//) the bulge component,
 the amount of which is proportional to the stellar mass. Signif
 icant diffuse soft x-ray emission is detected only within -10 kpc
 of the disk and bulge of a galaxy.
 The gas typically has a mean characteristic temperature of
 ~1063 K, although there is evidence for a high-temperature
 component (up to >107 K) in and around galactic disks with
 active star formation (34, 38). This high-temperature compo
 nent may represent a significant galactic hot gaseous outflow.
 The interaction of this outflow with cool gas (via shocks, dy
 namic mixing, and/or charge exchanges) is responsible for
 much of the low-temperature component (e.g., refs. 31, 38).
 The cooling rate, as inferred from the diffuse x-ray emission, is
 insignificant, compared to the expected stellar feedback alone.
 The bulk of the feedback is missing, especially in interarm re
 gions and in galactic spheroids.
 The hot CGM seems to have a very low density and may not
 account for the missing baryon matter expected in individual
 galactic dark matter halos.
 Although the above results are generally consistent with those
 found for our own galaxy, the studies of nearby galaxies also show
 intriguing substructures in the diffuse hot gas distributions (e.g.,
 the apparent positive radial temperature and metal abundance
 gradients in elliptical galaxies).
 Discussion
 As shown above, the diffuse soft x-ray emission observed in and
 around galaxies clearly traces the global hot gas that is heated by
 the stellar and possibly AGN feedback. By comparing the x-ray
 observations with physical models and/or simulations of the feed
 back, we may further study its dynamics, which is so far hardly
 known. The following discussion is concentrated on the modeling
 of the feedback in galactic spheroids for their relative simplicity.
 The presence of substantial cool gas and star formation, as in
 typical disk galaxies, would certainly add complications.
 Comparison of Feedback Models with X-Ray Observations. The miss
 ing feedback problem is particularly acute in so-called low LX/LK
 spheroid-dominated galaxies. Empirically, the Ia SN rate is
 ?(0.019SNyr-1)10-a42^[L^/(1010Lo^)j, where LK is the
 K-band luminosity of a galaxy (53). Adopting the color index
 B - K ? 4 for a typical spheroid, we estimate the total mechanical
 energy injection from Ia SNe (assuming 1051 ergs each) is
 LIa ? (1.3 x 1040 ergss-1)[L^/(1010Lo^)].Themechanicalenergy
 release of an AGN can also be estimated empirically (52, 54) as
 ^agn = (1-1 x 1039 ergs-1)[L^/(1010L^o)]2. Therefore, aver
 aged over the time, Ia SNe are energetically more important than
 the AGN in a galactic spheroid withL# < 101 lLK Q. Furthermore,
 SN blastwaves provide a natural distributed heating mechanism
 for hot gas in galactic spheroids (55). Additional continuous heat
 ing is expected from converting the kinetic energy of stellar mass
 loss from randomly moving evolved stars to the thermal energy.
 On the other hand, the AGN feedback, likely occurring in bursts
 with certain preferential directions (e.g., in form of jets), can
 occasionally result in significant disturbances in global hot gas
 distributions, as reflected by the asymmetric x-ray morphologies
 observed in some elliptical galaxies (e.g., ref. 27). It is not yet clear
 as to what fraction of the AGN feedback energy is converted
 into the heating of the hot gas observed. In general, the lack of
 distributed cool gas in galactic spheroids makes it difficult to con
 vert and release the thermal energy into radiation in wavelength
 bands other than the x-ray.
 Not only the mechanical energy, the gas mass from the stars and
 Ia SNe, especially heavy elements, is missing as well. The mass in
 jection rate is expected to be 0.026[LK/(1010LK Q)]MQ yr-1 with a
 mean iron abundance ZFe ?Z+>Fe + 4(MFe/0.7Mo),whereZ5)c Fe is
 the iron abundance of the stars while MFe is the iron mass yield
 per Ia SN (e.g., refs. 53, 56, 57). The above empirical estimates
 of the energy and mass feedback rates, which should be accurate
 within a factor of -2, are typically a factor of ~102 greater than
 what are inferred from the diffuse x-ray emission. Naturally,
 one would expect that the missing feedback is gone with a wind
 (outflow), spheroid wide or even galaxy wide.
 The notion that Ia SNe may drive galactic winds is not new
 (e.g., refs. 57, 58, 59). But could such winds explain the diffuse
 x-ray emission of galactic spheroids? It is easy to construct a
 ID steady-state supersonic wind model, assuming that the speci
 fic energy of the feedback (per mass) of a galaxy is large enough
 to overcome its gravitational bounding and that the CGM pres
 sure (thermal or ram) is negligible (e.g., ref. 60). This supersonic
 wind model depends primarily on two feedback parameters: the
 integrated energy and mass input rates. However, the model in
 general fails miserably: It predicts a too low luminosity (by a
 factor of ~102), a too high temperature (a factor of a few),
 and a too steep radial intensity profile to be consistent with Chan
 dra observations of low LX/LB galactic spheroids, in particular
 those in M31 and M104 (37, 43). Only few very low-mass and
 gas-poor spheroids, hence very faint in x-ray emission, still seem
 to be consistent with the ID wind model (e.g., ref. 45).
 To compare with the x-ray emission, in fact, one needs to ac
 count for 3D effects. X-ray emission is proportional to the emis
 sion measure and is thus sensitive to the detailed structure of hot
 gas in a galactic spheroid. To realistically generate the inhomo
 geneity in the heating and chemical enrichment processes, Tang
 and Wang have developed a scheme to embed adaptively selected
 ID SNR seeds in 3D spheroid-wide simulations of supersonic

 Fig. 4. Sample snapshots of hydrodynamic simulations of the stellar feed
 back. (A) The 3D simulated gas density distribution in an M31-like galactic
 spheroid. The slice is cut near the spheroid center and the units are in atoms
 cm-3, logarithmically. (B) Simulated 2D large-scale gas density distribution in
 the r-z plane (in units of kiloparsec). A nearly vertical magnetic field, similar
 to what is observed in the intercloud medium of the galactic center, is in
 cluded in the simulation to test its confinement effect on the spheroid wind;
 a reverse-shock is clearly visible. Also apparent are instabilities at the contact
 discontinuity between the shocked spheroid wind gas and the ejected mate
 rials from the initial starburst. The density is scaled in units of MQ kpc-3.
 Soft x-ray emission arises primarily from relatively low
 temperature and low-abundance gas shells associated with
 SN blastwaves. The inhomogeneity in the gas density and
 temperature substantially alters the spectral shape and leads
 to artificially lower metal abundances (by a factor of a few)
 in a spectral fit with a simplistic thermal plasma model.
 Reverse shock-heated SN ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy,
 quickly reaches a substantially higher outward velocity than the
 ambient medium. The ejecta is gradually and dynamically
 mixed with the medium at large galactic radii and is also slowly
 diluted and cooled by in situ mass injection from evolved
 stars. These processes together naturally result in the observed
 positive gradient in the average radial iron abundance distri
 bution of the hot gas, even if mass-weighted.
 The average ID and 3D simulations give substantially different
 radial temperature profiles; the inner temperature gradient in
 the 3D simulation is positive, mimicking a "cooling flow."
 (Thus the study of nearby spheroids may provide insights into
 the behavior of the intragroup or intracluster gas around
 central galaxies, for which sporadic AGN energy injections
 somewhat mimic the SN heating considered here.)
 The inhomogeneity also enhances the diffuse x-ray luminosity
 by a factor of a few in the supersonic wind case and more in a
 subsonic outflow. In addition, a subsonic outflow can have a
 rather flat radial x-ray intensity distribution.
 The dynamics and hence the luminosity of a subsonic flow
 further depend on the spheroid star formation and feedback
 history. This dependence, or the resultant luminosity variance,
 may then explain the observed large dispersion in the x-ray to
 K-band luminosity ratios of elliptical galaxies.
 All considered, subsonic outflows appear to be most consistent
 with the x-ray observations of diffuse hot gas in typical intermedi
 ate-mass galactic spheroids and elliptical galaxies.
 Interplay Between the Feedback and Galaxy Evolution. Whether a
 galactic outflow is supersonic or subsonic depends not only on
 the specific energy of the ongoing feedback, but also on the prop
 erties of the CGM, which is a result of the past interplay between
 the feedback and the accretion of a galaxy or a group of galaxies
 from the intergalactic medium (IGM). Tang et al. have illustrated
 how this interplay may work, based on several ID hydrodynamic
 simulations in the context of galaxy formation and evolution (62).
 They approximate the feedback history as having two distinct
 phases: (/) an early starburst during the spheroid formation
 (e.g., as a result of rapid galaxy mergers) and (ii) a subsequent
 long-lasting and slowly declining inje
