Preface to the English Edition
The view defended in this book can be summarized in essence as follows: there are
strictly universal logical principles presupposed by the various modern systems of
‘classical’ and ‘non-classical’ deductive logic. The universal validity of these princi-
ples stems solely from the meaning of the logical vocabulary used in their formulas,
and this meaning can be determined by analytically discoverable definitions of the
logical constants belonging to that vocabulary.
I call this view logical monism. For according to it there is exactly one system
of deductive logic which can make explicit the logical principles which the other
systems presuppose as valid in different ways. Logical monism is opposed to what
today is called ‘logical pluralism’, since according to that view the different systems
of deductive logic have an equal claim to validity, so that it is a question of mere
choice which system is to be preferred to others. In what follows, however, a criti-
cism of logical pluralism will not be my explicit topic.1 Rather, my aim here is to
show in detail that and why logical monism is tenable. Some preliminary remarks
may suffice to explain my intention a little more precisely.
The idea of logical monism, as I understand it, goes back to Kant. For he under-
stood logic as the “science of the rules of understanding in general” and assumed it
to concern either the “general” or the “particular use of understanding”, which is
why he divided it into a general logic and into (an indeterminate number of) spe-
cial logics; in doing so, he called that logic general which “contains the absolutely
necessary rules of thinking, without which no use of understanding takes place,
and it therefore concerns these rules without regard to the difference of the objects
to which it may be directed” (Kant, CPR B 76).2 Accordingly, Kant assumed that spe-
cial logics presuppose the rules of the general logic as valid.
Now the modern logical systems were still unknown to Kant, and by “general
logic” he could only mean the traditional syllogistic, going back to Aristotle. We
must thus ask whether one is justified in relating Kant’s division of logic to the
systems known today, since he could not comment on them directly and knew
nothing about their relation to the syllogistic.
As far as his appreciation of the syllogistic as general logic is concerned, he saw
its “advantage” in its “own limitation” of being “the science that exhaustively
presents and strictly proves nothing but the formal rules of all thinking [. . .]” (CPR
B viii–ix). Because of its limitation, general logic is “justified in abstracting – is even
obliged to abstract – from all objects of cognition and all the distinctions between
them”; for in it, “the understanding has to do with nothing further than itself and its
It is the topic of my article, Wolff 2013.

own form” (CPR B ix). To this advantage it owes its success (CPR B ix) and the “se-
cure path of a science”, which it has taken “from the earliest times” (CPR B vii–viii).
“As general logic it abstracts from all contents of the cognition of the understanding
and of the difference of its objects, and has to do with nothing but the mere form of
thinking”; as “pure logic it has no empirical principles,” which is why it “draws noth-
ing from psychology” but is a “proven doctrine” in which “everything [. . .] must be
completely certain a priori” (CPR B 78, modified).3 As a logic that abstracts “from all
content of cognition (whether it be pure or empirical)” it is “merely formal logic”
(CPR B 170; cf. 77) and as such not an “organon” (i.e., an instrument) for bringing
forth cognitions, but only a “canon” (i.e., a norm) “of the understanding and reason”
(CPR B 77).4 For, mere “agreement with the general and formal laws” of general
logic never guarantees truth, but concerns “only the form of truth” and is not a suf-
ficient, but only a “negative condition” (“the conditio sine qua non”) “of all truth”
(CPR B 84–85, cf. 824).
As far as special logics are concerned, Kant expected them to be an “organon
of this or that science” and to contain “the rules for correctly thinking about a cer-
tain kind of objects”; however, “if one will offer the rules for how a science of
[these objects] is to be brought about,” one must already know these objects “rather
well” (CPR B 76). For this reason, Kant regarded special logics as “the latest to be
reached in the course of human reason, once the science is already long complete
and requires only the final touch for its improvement and perfection” (CPR B 76).
For him, special logics are projects for the future, projects in the making at best.
Kant could have had mathematics in mind as an example of a science that re-
quires a special logic. Thus, in his “Transcendental Doctrine of Method,” he outlines
the algebraic procedure of inferring from n to n + 1 as a method of mathematical
“demonstration”. It is known today as “mathematical induction”; Kant calls it “sym-
bolic construction” (CPR B 762).5 Though it was fundamental for the theory of natu-
ral numbers, the problem of how to justify it was considered an unsolved since the
17th century. It was Frege, in his Begriffsschrift of 1879 (in which he established the
first modern system of logic), who provided the key to the solution by deriving the
principle of mathematical induction from the axioms of this system (see Frege
1879/1967, Part III, §§ 23–27).
The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant leaves out “certain [gewiß]” in Kant’s
text, and thereby eliminates the idea that the universal validity of general logic must a priori, i.e.,
independent of all experience, rule out uncertainty and wavering regarding its principles.
‘Organon’ was the traditional name for Aristotle’s logical writings, ‘Canon’ the title of Epicurus’
treatise on logic, as Kant was well aware.

Preface to the English Edition

Obviously, the system founded by Frege should be regarded neither as ‘general’
nor as ‘formal’ logic in Kant’s sense.6 For it is based on axioms that consist of (logi-
cally) true judgments, which are formulated in a symbolic language modeled on
that of arithmetic. Frege therefore let his axioms (as well as all theorems derived
from them) begin with ‘⊢’, which means: “It is a fact that . . . ”.7✶This sign is fol-
lowed in the formulas of each axiom or theorem by the formula of a truth function
whose arguments are “judgeable contents”8 and which (for any interpretation of its
descriptive signs) has the value True. This function value is computable with truth
tables. The validity of the rules for deriving theorems from axioms is also based on
the computable truth of truth functions.9 These form, together with the axioms, the
“core” of a “boundless multitude of laws” derivable from them, in which “the con-
tent of all these laws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state” (Frege 1879, 25, § 13
[1967, 29]). Frege’s logic is therefore a system of laws which, just like algebraic equa-
tions, contain (true) judgments about facts of “pure” (i.e., non-empirical) thought.
Since truth always already “concerns” the “content” of “cognition” (Kant, CPR B 83),10
this logic is neither general nor formal in Kant’s sense: it cannot abstract from the
truth of the content of its axioms or theorems, nor can it abstract from all distinc-
tions between objects. For even functions of the form Φ (v), with which objects are
ascribed a “property” or a “relation” to other objects, are judgeable contents to
which reference is made in truth functions (Frege 1879, 18, § 10 [1967, 24]).
Frege’s use of functional expressions of different kinds was made possible by
a state of research in pure mathematics that allowed the simplest algebraic truths
such as x + x = 2x to be treated as functions whose arguments can stand for any-
thing countable (i.e., for any given objects) and whose value is always a truth
value. Therefore, Frege’s system (as well as the ‘classical’ logic that emerged from
it) may be called an organon in Kant’s sense, namely a cognitive tool that pure
mathematics needs in order to claim to be an a priori demonstrative, exact sci-
ence. In this sense it is a special, mathematical logic: an organon of arithmetic,
which can be used like a calculus.
The synonymy of ‘formal’ and ‘symbolic’ logic is not a feature of Frege’s terminology. It was
introduced by Russell (1903, 10).

Preface to the English Edition
VII

General logic, which Kant had in mind as a ‘canon’, differs from such a sys-
tem in that it contains no truths, but only rules for the “logical use of the under-
standing in general”; this consists in subordinating and coordinating concepts in
judgments and conclusions without contradiction (CPR B 92–94).11 It consists
therefore in actions by which one arranges possible concepts as in a pyramid of
terms (see below §§ 1, 4 and 6).12 If in such a pyramid letters represent the terms,
the relations between these correspond to the forms of the Kantian table of judg-
ments and the forms of inference in Aristotle’s Prior Analytics (see Part I, Section 1
below). No truth can be rendered with these forms, not even if one transforms
valid forms of inference into forms of judgment (e. g., if one converts the form of
syllogisms according to modus Barbara into the correct form of true hypothetical
judgments: ‘If every α is a β, then if every γ is an α, then every γ is a β’). Judgment
forms such as these, while logically valid, do not express a truth, but (to use
Kant’s term) only a “form of truth” (CPR B 84).13 As forms, they contain only “for-
mal laws” (CPR B 84) or forms of logical truth. Agreement with them is not a suffi-
cient but only a general and necessary condition for truth.
The universal validity of rules of the categorical or hypothetical syllogistic is
based solely on the meaning of the logical vocabulary that occurs in syllogisms. Thus,
the hypothetical conjunction ‘if p, then q’ merely indicates that q follows from p (CPR
B 98–99), and this means that p and ‘not q’ represent incompatible propositions. It is
due to this meaning that, e.g., an inference is valid according to modus ponendo po-
nens, so that, given ‘if p, then q’, q follows logically from p. This logical consequence
is thus not a function of the truth values of the judgeable contents of p and q.
Likewise, syllogistic negations (‘not p’) are not truth functions. For they have
the task “solely of preventing error” (CPR B 737; 97). That is, there are cases in
which ‘not p’ is compatible with ‘not not p’, i.e., cases in which the negation of a
false judgment admits the possibility of being negated itself. For example, the nega-
tion of a universal affirmative judgment has the form ‘not every α is a β’. It leaves
Cf. also Kant’s Dissertation (1770), Ak. 2: 393–94.
What Kant calls “logical use of the understanding in general” (usus intellectus logicus) refers
to the same actions that Plato described in his dialogue Sophist as “dihairēsis” and “synagogē” of
concepts. This description “undoubtedly influenced Aristotle in his invention of the syllogism”
(Kneale & Kneale 1975, 10; cf. 44 and 67).
To illustrate this with an example of Kant’s (cf. “The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Fig-
ures” (1762), Ak. 2: 48): According to modus Barbara, from the assumptions (1) ‘Everything rational
is a spirit’ and (2) ‘All human souls are rational’ it logically follows that (3) ‘All human souls are
spirits’. Provided there are no spirits, the counterfactual proposition ‘If (1) were true, then if (2)
were also true, (3) would also be true’ is true. But about objects and what is true of them, it says
nothing sufficient. Whether objects (like, e.g., spirits) exist at all cannot be judged by general logic
alone (as Kant understands it).

Preface to the English Edition

undecided whether α is an empty or a non-empty term, i.e., whether ‘not some α is
a β’ or ‘some α is not a β’ holds. Moreover, a negative universal affirmative is com-
patible with its subcontrary opposite, i.e., with a judgment of the form ‘some α is a
β’, thus also with the negation of its contradictory opposite (‘not not some α is a β’).
This means there are cases in which negations of the form ‘not p’ and ‘not not p’
are compatible with each other (and in which then ‘neither p nor not p’ does not
involve any contradiction either).
The semantic analysis of the logical vocabulary of the syllogistic is the task of
Part I of this book. This analysis shows that not only has Frege’s attempt to let
true judgments take the place of “Aristotelian modes of inference” (Frege 1879, 10,
Part I, § 6 [1967, 17]) by derivation from axioms failed but so has the attempt at a
“systematic derivation of traditional Aristotelian inferences” from principles of
the calculus of classes, carried out by Hilbert and Ackermann (1967, 57–63, II, § 3
[1950, 48–54]). Instead, the opposite of these attempts turns out to be true: the lan-
guage of the syllogistic is suitable to replace the logical vocabulary of modern
‘classical’ logic, so long as one postulates the validity of certain rules which can
be formulated in the syllogistic language but are invalid within the syllogistic. In
this case the principles of ‘classical’ logic can be derived from principles of syllo-
gistic. One can also extend the language of syllogistic by transforming functional
expressions of the form Φ (v) (for properties of or relations between objects) into
appropriate expressions for specified contents of concepts or of propositions. It is
also the task of Part I to show how this can be done.
Part II begins by showing that it is possible to establish basic rules and rules
for deduction which are valid on the basis of analytically obtained definitions of
the syllogistic vocabulary, and that is possible to derive on this basis all the rules
of the assertoric and modal syllogistic for which Aristotle has given or sketched
validity proofs in his Prior Analytics. Moreover, this Part shows that the validity
of syllogistic rules is implicitly presupposed in modern ‘classical’ logic. This is
done by proving that its axioms and basic rules can be derived from syllogistic
principles, so long as one postulates the validity of four rules (see § 72) which can
be expressed in syllogistic language though without being valid in syllogistic
logic. In this way, Part II confirms Kant’s assumption that Aristotelian logic is a
general logic, insofar as its rules underlie even modern ‘classical’ logic.
However, the logic founded by Frege – as well as the modified version in the
Principia Mathematica by Russell and Whitehead – does not contain modal logic,
but avoids the use of modal expressions like ‘necessary’, ‘possible’, ‘compatible’
etc. These are indispensable for ordinary logical thinking and occur already in
the syllogistic because the meaning of the assertoric-logical vocabulary depends

on their use.14 Therefore one must regard ‘classical’ logic as a special logic for two
reasons: first, because it does not contain a modal logic; and second, because its
principles can be derived from syllogistic principles if one postulates four pseudo-
syllogistic rules as valid.
In a similar way, one must consider the ‘non-classical’ logics as special logics.
These include the systems of intuitionistic logic, (paraconsistent) relevance logic,
‘free’15 logic, and axiomatic modal logic.16 These systems (as well as those resulting
from their mutual combination) are special logics in the same sense as ‘classical’
logic is. The task of the appendices at the end of this book is to justify this thesis.
Here I will explain it only briefly.
First, each of the four ‘non-classical’ systems are built on only one of the syllo-
gistic subsystems. Intuitionistic logic and relevance logic are merely alternatives to
‘classical’ propositional logic, and ‘free’ logic is merely an alternative to ‘classical’
predicate logic; axiomatic modal logics are merely modal complements either to
‘classical’ propositional logic or to its two alternatives.17 Second, the ‘non-classical’
systems have in common that they (unless they presuppose ‘classical’ propositional
logic and merely add a modal propositional logic, like Lewis’ systems of axiomatic
modal logic) do not presuppose as valid each of the four pseudo-syllogistic postu-
lates from § 72. Yet in modern modal logic as well, certain axioms have been intro-
duced which (analogous to the postulates of § 72) presuppose rules whose validity
can only be postulated, because though they are expressible in the modal syllogistic
language, they are not valid in the modal syllogistic. In this way it becomes evident
that the logical vocabulary used in the systems of ‘non-classical’ deductive logic,
just as that used in ‘classical’ logic, can be translated into the language of the syllo-
gistic. This language is thus a universal language of deductive logic.
Even to explain the meaning of the logical vocabulary of the assertoric syllogistic, modal ex-
pressions are needed. Note, for example, Aristotle’s semantic explanation of ‘being predicated of
all’ and ‘being predicated of none’ as used as logical vocabulary in universal affirmative or nega-
tive categorical judgments (see Analytica priora 1. 1, 24 b 28–30).
‘Free’ is here the commonly used abbreviation for ‘free of existence assumptions with respect
to terms.’
I do not count many-valued logics as ‘non-classical’ in the strict sense. They can be regarded
as (hybrid) variants of ‘classical’ logic, since they differ from it only in that they allow, apart
from the truth values of true and false, intermediate values for ‘neither true nor false’, from
which function values can be calculated with truth tables. They presuppose the invalidity of the
principle of bivalence and thus a change of the meaning of ‘true’ and ‘false’ (and of ‘truth value’).
See Appendix 8. However, the function value of a many-valued ‘truth’ function in all cases where
none of its arguments is an intermediate value is the same as its value in two-valued ‘classical’
logic.
On the controversial sense of an axiomatic quantified modal logic, see Appendix 7.

Preface to the English Edition

The systems of ‘non-classical’ logic can be built up as axiomatic systems just
like ‘classical’ logic. But the validity of their axioms and derivation rules cannot
be calculated by truth tables. The meaning of the logical vocabulary in the differ-
ent systems of ‘non-classical’ logic thus differs from the meaning it has in ‘classi-
cal’ logic. For in ‘non-classical’ logic this vocabulary is not used truth-functionally
but receives its meaning by the respective system of axioms and rules of deriva-
tion. What it means in each case to be logically true or derivable depends on this.
The relationships between the different systems of modern deductive logic (in-
cluding insofar as they can be related to the axiomatic systems of mathematics
which have developed since Peano) have become the subject of mathematical logic
in the 20th century, which therefore has (as Gödel [1944, 125] describes it) “two
quite different aspects”: On the one hand, it has become a “section of mathematics
treating of classes, relations, combinations of symbols, etc. instead of numbers,
functions, geometrical figures, etc.”; on the other hand, “it is a science prior to all
others,” which contains “the principles underlying all sciences”; “in this second
sense,” it is in accordance with the “idea of a logical calculus really sufficient for
the kind of reasoning occurring in the exact sciences.”
Whether and to what extent this very broad concept of mathematical logic
strikes a chord with Kant’s assumption that the logic of the particular use of un-
derstanding is an organon of this or that science is a question I do not deal with
in this book. It is clear, however, that even according to this concept mathemati-
cal logic cannot be identified with general logic in the Kantian sense, i.e., in the
sense of logical monism.

The text of the present book – including the above preface – corresponds to that
which will be published next spring (2023) in a third and improved edition under
the title ‘Abhandlung über die Prinzipien der Logik’ by Vittorio Klostermann
(Frankfurt am Main). Among the changes and improvements that this edition con-
tains over the earlier ones, many have been prompted by questions from the
translator, William Clark Wolf, about the best possible translation of a dark Ger-
man expression. I am grateful to him for his careful work on this book and not
least for his philosophical interest to which it owes its existence.

Introduction
Even if one is not prepared to accept that the analysis of language is the only or
most important method of philosophy, one can still agree to a view which Gottlob
Frege, one of the founding fathers of analytic philosophy, expressed in the follow-
ing way. It is, he says,
one of the tasks of philosophy to break the domination of the word over the human spirit
by laying bear the misconceptions that through the use of language often almost unavoid-
ably arise concerning the relations between concepts and by freeing thought from the
means of expression of ordinary language which only burden it [. . .]. (Frege 1879, vi–vii
[1967, 7])
By the “use of language,” Frege means here the use of natural language.
But one can, or rather should, also connect the task of philosophy to the use
of non-natural languages, especially to the use of formal languages which are ap-
plied in logic to rules of inference and to portray what Frege calls, in the passage
just cited, “relations between concepts.” Already from his perspective logic had
“hitherto always followed ordinary language and grammar too closely” (Frege
1879, vii [1967, 7]). Hence, he saw that the use of formal-logical languages was
open in part to the same critique as the use of natural languages; their vulnerabil-
ity to critique was what provided him with the justification for inaugurating a
new kind of formal-logical language – the concept-script (Begriffsschrift).
However, although we can find in Frege’s writings numerous critical remarks
on the language of the syllogistic going back to Aristotle as well as the “Boolean for-
mal language,” something like a systematic analysis of these languages is still absent
from them. A systematic comparison of the capability of these languages with the
capability of the concept-script – or with the capability of languages which are in
use instead of the concept-script in modern deductive logic – has not (as far as I
know) been undertaken until now, or at least not with the necessary thoroughness.
In Part I of this essay, in §§ 1–40, I will subject the formal languages of deduc-
tive logic to a systematic analysis and a systematic comparison of their merits.
This comparison will especially bear on the capability of these languages to pres-
ent conceptual relations (which Frege mentions in the quote just cited).
Part II, §§ 41–84, presupposes the analysis of Part I of this essay. In these para-
graphs, a clear and precise presentation of the systematic structure of deductive
logic will be given, and this in a language which is able to portray logical relations
between any concepts. In this language, all rules and laws of deductive logic can be
presented. It will emerge that syllogistic rules are distinguished by the fact that their
validity depends only on the meaning of the logical vocabulary of this language.

I do not wish to put questions pertaining to the historical relationship be-
tween syllogistic and modern, mathematical logic at the center of the following
investigations. (I will go into these issues only in passing, at the end of Part II,
§ 84.) I would rather like to be guided by the systematic question whether the lan-
guage of syllogistic can be reduced to a more elementary, non-syllogistic language.
In order to be able to answer this question – in the negative (to anticipate my an-
swer) – it will be necessary at first to describe precisely the logical vocabulary with
which the language of syllogistic represents conceptual relations.
– The question of what concepts really are will not be systematically treated in
this book. Frege believed that a ‘real definition’ could not be given to determine
‘the essence of concepts’. But he pointed out that the grammatical distinction be-
tween proper names (nomina propria) and substantives (nomina appellativa) corre-
sponds in some way to the distinction between object-designators and concept
words. Concept words are accordingly expressions which “come with the indefinite
article and with words like ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘many’, etc.” Thus, the expression ‘square
root of four’ in the proposition ‘There is at least one square root of four’ corre-
sponds to “the concept square root of 4.”18 At a later point (§§ 33–35) it will be nec-
essary for me to go into Frege’s views on proper names and concept expressions.
For now, it may suffice to mention that I use the word ‘concept’ in this book so that
it designates precisely what a concept word or a concept expression is used to indi-
cate. Concept words and concept expressions should be understood as expressions
that can be preceded by the definite or indefinite article or a word like ‘all’, ‘some’,
‘many’, etc. This usage corresponds to a use of the word ‘concept’ which is not only
to be found in Frege but was also common practice in the traditional syllogistic. –
My application of the method of logico-semantic language analysis to the lan-
guages of logic will show that the view held by Frege, Hilbert, and others – that
the logical vocabulary of the syllogistic is replaceable, without change in mean-
ing, by truth-functional and quantified expressions, or by expressions of the cal-
culus of classes – is untenable, since truth-functional expressions are equivalent
to complex expressions, and class-logical and quantificational expressions to non-
formal syllogistic expressions. The logical vocabulary of the syllogistic suffices, as
can be proved, to render all valid rules and laws of deductive logic, including
modal logic. On the other hand, the rules and laws formulated only within the
language of a modern system of the calculus of functions or calculus of classes (to
which “classical” predicate logic belongs) prove not to be universally valid, since
their validity does not depend exclusively on the meaning of the logical vocabu-
lary they use. These systems implicitly presuppose the validity of the syllogistic
and are derivable from it so long as, in addition to the universally valid syllogistic
See Frege’s letter to Liebmann from August 1900 in Frege 1976, 150 (1980, 92–93).

rules (and in addition to the necessary transformation rules with which complex
and non-formal syllogistic expressions are translatable in other logical languages),
certain non-universally valid rules (on which ultimately depend the divergence of
these different logical systems) are formulated and accepted as valid in the syllogis-
tic language. Part II of this essay will show extensively how this derivation is to be
rigorously and seamlessly carried out, following a method already developed in the
school of Aristotle.

Section One
The Language of the Syllogistic
1 The Language of the Assertoric Syllogistic
§ 1 Syllogistic Propositional Schemata
I understand by a syllogistic propositional schema an expression which is suited
to present relations between concepts as they occur within a concept pyramid.
Let α, β, γ, etc. be concepts of various generality, and let there be an order be-
tween them such that β and γ divide the concept α, so that they are subordinated
to it and are at the same time coordinated with each other. In the same way, let δ
and ϵ be subordinated to the concept β and coordinated with each other. Then
the order just described is based on α, as a higher concept to β and γ, being the
most general concept, while δ and ε, as lower concepts to β, are less general than
α or β.19 The hierarchy of these five concepts can be presented in a diagram
which resembles a fragment of a pyramid
When one represents the conceptual relations portrayed in this diagram with ex-
pressions that resemble propositions except that all concept expressions are re-
placed with ‘α’, ‘β’, ‘γ’, ‘δ’, and ‘ε’, i.e., with concept variables, then the resulting
expressions are those I will call syllogistic propositional schemata. As we can eas-
ily see from the relations illustrated in Figure 1, these are expressions like:
(1)
‘every β is an α,’
(2)
‘every γ is not a β,’
(3)
‘some α is a γ,’
(4)
‘some α is not a δ,’
Figure 1
One already finds examples of conceptual hierarchies in Plato’s dialogues. The investigations
of conceptual hierarchies carried out in Plato’s Sophist, 218e–221c, were especially important for
the emergence of syllogistic. Cf. Kneale & Kneale 1975, 9–10, 44, and 67.

(5)
‘if some α is an ε, then that α✶is a β,’
(6)
‘if some α is a β, then that α is not a γ,’
(7)
‘either some α is a β, or that α is a γ,’
(8)
‘if some α is a β, then either that α is a δ, or that α is an ε.’
These propositional schemata can be appropriately called ‘syllogistic’ schemata
insofar as they represent judgment forms which are of fundamental interest for
the syllogistic theory of deductive inference.20
The syllogistic has always taken a special interest in such judgment forms be-
cause there are deductive inferences whose validity depends on certain arrange-
ments of propositions which partake in these forms. Since Aristotle, inferences of
this kind are called syllogisms. A syllogism is present, for example, when ‘every δ
is an α’ is inferred from two premises of the form ‘every δ is a β’ and ‘every β is
an α’. Likewise, there is a syllogism when from two premises of the form ‘if some
α is an ε, then that α is a β’ and ‘some α is an ε’, ‘that α is a β’ is inferred. The
validity of syllogisms is independent of the conceptual content of the propositions
that comprise them. That is, it is totally immaterial for the validity of syllogisms
what names or nominal phrases appear (via concept variables) in the schemata
of their premises and conclusion. Only the logical form of syllogisms is decisive
for their validity. And logical form is represented by some arrangement of syllo-
gistic propositional schemata.
That a syllogism possesses validity on the basis of its logical form alone im-
plies that this validity can be made intelligible by explaining the meaning of the
non-variable expressions which occur in the syllogistic schemata of the proposi-
tions that comprise it. Appropriate definitions which explain the meaning of
these expressions will of course be needed to make intelligible the validity of
rules which correspond to syllogistic inferences.
I will leave aside for now the question as to what precise content these defini-
tions should have. For so far I have neither established a survey of what syllogistic
propositional schemata there are, nor have I clarified the systematic relevance of
these schemata for the theory of deductive inference. Hence it may suffice prelim-
inarily to stipulate that the definitions we seek have the task of making explicit the
Further below, I will come to speak about the fact that syllogistic propositional schemata can,
in certain circumstances, result in truth-functional propositional schemata without themselves
being truth-functional. Hence, one can read out not only syllogistic but also truth-functional
propositional schemata from Figure 1.
✶TN: The convention ‘that . . .’ is often used to represent the author’s phrase “das in Rede ste-
hende . . .” (lit. ‘the . . . being discussed’, or ‘the . . . in question’). See below (§ 15) for further
discussion of this phrase.

meaning tied to the expressions of syllogistic propositional schemata insofar as
they are suited to represent conceptual hierarchies.
§ 2 In Search of a Universal Language of Deductive Logic
We can see that the task of the syllogistic consists in making intelligible, using
definitions, the validity of rules according to which propositions conforming to
propositional schemata follow from other such propositions. Provided it fulfills
precisely this task, we can regard the syllogistic as a subdomain of deductive logic,
namely, as a subdomain of the theory of valid deductive inference.
Yet we can also ask whether the syllogistic is an irreducible, indispensable
subdomain of deductive logic.
Without doubt, deductive logic would get along without the syllogistic if it
were possible to reduce all syllogistic rules of deductive inference to non-syllogistic
rules. In that case, such non-syllogistic rules would be understood as forms of de-
ductive inference which cannot be rendered by arranging syllogistic propositional
schemata, or – to the extent that they could be rendered by such arrangements –
whose validity does not depend on (or not only on) the meaning of the expressions
that occur in syllogistic propositional schemata.
To be able to decide on the question whether syllogistic rules can be reduced
to non-syllogistic rules, we must establish how far it is possible to translate the
language of syllogistic propositional schemata into a language that can render
both syllogistic as well as non-syllogistic forms of inference. If it should be possi-
ble to reduce all syllogistic rules to non-syllogistic rules, then it may also be possi-
ble to deal with a sphere of deductive logic in a uniform formal language, which
encompasses the syllogistic and is thus greater than it. This language, if its sphere
encompassed the whole of deductive logic, would be considered a universal lan-
guage of deductive logic.
In the following sections I intend to test the pertinent possibilities of such a
translation.
At the basis of this test, I will set a criterion by which the language of the
syllogistic can be distinguished from non-syllogistic formal languages. This crite-
rion consists in the fact that the only object variables which the syllogistic lan-
guage requires are concept variables, so that all remaining expressions occurring
in the language are used only to present relations between concepts as they be-
long to a hierarchical order as in the diagram in Figure 1. As for concept variables
(‘α’, ‘β’, etc.), they are to be regarded as substitutes or placeholders for any
1 The Language of the Assertoric Syllogistic § 2

nomina apellativa, or for nominal phrases of any complexity that can be prefixed
by a definite or indefinite article. I call these expressions concept expressions or – if
they are not composed of several words (like, e.g., ‘horse’) – concept words. When a
concept expression is represented by a syllogistic concept variable, it is called a
term.21 Accordingly, a concept is to be regarded as that for which a term stands.
Whatever else concepts may be does not need to be further explained for the pur-
poses of the syllogistic. From the perspective of the syllogistic, concepts are what
comprise the conceptual content or the logical material of a judgment. The remaining
expressions belonging to the language of the syllogistic which occur in syllogistic
propositional schemata make up the logical vocabulary of this language. From the
standpoint of the syllogistic, the logical form of propositions or judgments depends
on these, while their conceptual content depends on the interpretation conferred on
the concept variables of each propositional schema that expresses their logical form.
For the moment, I do not need to make a final decision on the question as to
which expressions can be counted among the logical vocabulary of syllogistic. No
complete survey of this vocabulary is required at the outset of this investigation,
since for the time being there is no telling how large the sphere of the syllogistic is.
Rather, we must first know whether the syllogistic is possible as a systematically
relevant, independent, irreducible sphere of deductive logic at all. This question
can already be discussed to some extent with the logical vocabulary that occurs in
propositional schemata (1) to (8), enumerated in § 1. Only when this vocabulary has
proved to be dispensable or indispensable for deductive logic will we be able to
deal with the question of how it relates to other parts of the syllogistic vocabulary.
§ 3 The Logical Vocabulary of the Assertoric Syllogistic
The logical vocabulary that occurs in the propositional schemata (1) to (8) consists
in the following seven expressions:
‘every . . .’,
‘. . . is a . . .’,
‘. . . is not a . . .’,
“Term” is a literal translation of the metaphor “ὅϱος” used by Aristotle. John Stuart Mill, in
his work A System of Logic (1843, Vol. 1, Ch. 1, § 3) called concept expressions “general names”, in
order to distinguish them from proper names and identifying labels, so-called “singular” or “indi-
vidual” names. Following Mill, modern logicians sometimes call syllogistic terms general terms in
order to distinguish them from singular terms. See Quine 1959, 65 (§ 12). The reasons for which I
do not follow this custom will become clearer in what follows; see especially §§ 33–35 below.

Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

‘some . . .’,
‘if . . ., then . . .’,
‘that . . .’,
‘either . . ., or . . .’
It will be helpful to organize these seven expressions from a logico-semantic
perspective.
As for the expressions ‘every . . .’, ‘some . . .’, ‘that . . .’, the traditional syllogis-
tic literature uses them for what is called the quantitative determination – or sim-
ply the quantity – of a judgment.22 These three expressions (or their equivalents)
determine whether a given judgment is universal, particular, or singular.
The collocations ‘. . . is a . . .’ and ‘is not a . . .’ establish a judgment as affirma-
tive or negative. Affirmation and negation can be regarded as the logical forms of
a judgement’s qualitative determination – what is traditionally called the logical
quality of a judgment.23
Finally, if a proposition contains the collocations ‘if . . ., then . . .’ or ‘either
. . ., or . . .’, it is a hypothetical or disjunctive statement, respectively. The special
role of these expressions is to indicate a logical relation between two or (as is pos-
sible in the case of the disjunctive statement) more than two parts of a state-
ment.24 The clauses of a hypothetical or distinctive judgment stand in a logically
relevant relation to the extent that the truth or falsity of the judgment depends in
a definite way on the truth or falsity of each of the relevant clauses. Thus, a hypo-
thetical judgment says that it is impossible that the statement of its antecedent is
true and the statement of its consequent false. That is, it says that there is a conse-
quence relation between the statement of the antecedent and the consequent. A
disjunctive judgment says, first, that no more than one of its sub-propositions can
be true and, second, that it is impossible that one of its sub-propositions is false
but none of the remaining sub-propositions true. In this way, it renders an oppo-
sition within a totality of alternative statements.25
Apuleius Madaurensis, “Peri hermeniae” (Opera 3, 1908, 177) is the locus classicus here.
This tradition goes back to Apuleius as well; see the passage just cited in note 22.
‘Relation’ as a name of a logical criterion for classifying judgments goes back to a terminology
introduced by Kant; see CPR, § 9. It has sometimes been seen as appropriate from the standpoint
of modern logic to polemicize with unnecessary sharpness against the classification of the forms
of judgment which Kant carried out in his “arbitrarily compiled table of judgments” (Menne
1985, 11). We will deal with the question of the substantiality of this polemic in the course of the
following investigation.
The words ‘hypothetical’ and ‘disjunctive’ are used in various ways in the literature on mod-
ern logic. I use them here and in what follows exclusively to designate syllogistic relations. I give
a more precise explanation below in § 47. Already in the conception of the ancient Peripatetics

In this way, the logical vocabulary used in § 1 to formulate the syllogistic
propositional schemata (1) to (8) can be divided, from a logico-semantic perspec-
tive, into three groups of expressions which we can take as the logical constants
of the syllogistic.
§ 4 Additions to the Logical Vocabulary of the Assertoric Syllogistic
Given the criterion mentioned in § 2, according to which the language of the syllo-
gistic is distinguished from non-syllogistic formal language in that its only object
variables are concept variables, it is not hard to realize that a list of the logical con-
stants of syllogistic would be incomplete if it contained only the seven expressions
enumerated. This enumeration is indeed incomplete, since the propositional sche-
mata (1) to (8) reflect only a special case of hierarchical conceptual arrangement. I
had illustrated this arrangement in § 1 as a fragment of a pyramid in Figure 1.
and of Stoic logic, the junctor of the hypothetical proposition, ‘if . . ., then . . .’, portrays that a
“consequence” (ἀκολουϑία) obtains. Kant followed this conception as well (cf. CPR, § 9). The hy-
pothetical ‘if . . ., then . . .’ should not, as often occurs in modern logic books, be confused with
(truth-functional) subjunction (which is also sometimes called a conditional; in German it corre-
sponds instead to the colloquial propositional connective ‘nicht. . ., ohne daß. . .’ [‘not. . ., with-
out. . .’]) (See §§ 30 f.). It is hence unfounded when Günther Patzig, in his essay “Die logischen
Formen praktischer Sätze in Kants Ethik” (1994, 212), writes that the truth value of ‘if p, then q’
depends “only on the truth value of the connected statements.” Patzig adds as a comment:
“A factual implication obtains between the statements p and q when the new statement produced
by the ‘if-then’ junctor is true; logical implication obtains when this molecular statement is logi-
cally true. Only in this last case does it make unambiguous sense to speak of ground-consequence
relations in terms of derivability. Kant did not see through the fuzziness of his contemporary
logic, reflected in its fuzzy terminology; [. . .].” But this comment does not improve the matter.
Rather, according to modus ponendo ponens, q is derivable from p if and only if ‘if p, then q’ is
true. And ‘if p, then q’ is true if and only if q (factually or logically) follows from p. It is not neces-
sary that ‘if p, then q’ is logically true for this consequence relation to obtain. Neither does the
truth value of ‘if p, then q’ depend only on the truth values of p and q: if q is true or p false, q
need not follow from p. Frege also made note of this situation in order to distinguish between
the ‘if-then’ of the “hypothetical” judgment and that of the subjunction sign (i.e., his conditional
stroke). See Frege 1879/1967, § 5; Frege 1882a, 102 (1968, 93). The terminological fuzziness of which
Patzig here accuses Kant rests entirely on his own side, namely, in his confusion of subjunctive
and hypothetical judgments. Incidentally, we can see here how much caution and restraint is
needed in using the maxim which Patzig (1970, 85) recommends for the interpretation of philo-
sophical texts, namely, the maxim: to assume that “wherever” it “is not possible” in such a text
“to translate [its propositions and its context] into the Fregean concept-script or one of the later
notations influenced by it,” it “is not worth-while” to want “to proceed with the effort of philo-
sophical interpretation, because the text is not sufficiently thought out.”

There are, however, hierarchical conceptual relations which are not considered in
this diagram. First of all, only dichotomies are considered in it, without allowing for
conceptual divisions into three or more lower concepts.26 Second, this diagram
leaves out of consideration the case where the dichotomy consists in an analytic
concept division. I speak of an analytic concept division in the following sense. Let
α be a concept to which β is subordinated. Then every β is an α. And if, moreover,
some α is not a β, but instead a γ, δ, or whatever else, then it belongs to some α not
to be a β. Another way of saying this is that it falls under the concept not-β. Of two
concepts which related to each other as β and not-β, I say that each is the antonym
of the other. I call the division of a concept into a subordinate concept and its anto-
nym analytic.27 Every concept division into two or more lower concepts can be re-
placed by an analytic concept division without its validity being altered. Hence a
propositional schema like (7) (‘either some α is a β, or that α is a γ’) can be replaced
by:
(9) ‘either some α is a β, or that α is a not-β’.
This can be illustrated by the following diagram:
This diagram should not be misunderstood as if it said that the concept for which
‘not-β’ stands is subordinated to the concept for which ‘α’ stands in the same way
as the concept for which ‘β’ stands is subordinated to it. That is, the scope of the
concept not-β is too great on any interpretation of α and β to be contained in the
scope of the concept α. Hence, Figure 2 should not be interpreted as always corre-
sponding to a propositional schema of the form ‘every not-β is an α’. Instead, Fig-
ure 2 should be interpreted so that it expresses a conceptual relationship that can
be stated by the propositional schema
(10) ‘some α is a not-β’.
not-β
Figure 2
The two-membered disjunctive judgment, as already indicated in § 3, is a special case.
As far as I know, it was Kant who introduced the expression ‘analytic division’ with the mean-
ing just mentioned. Cf. Kant, Critique of Judgment, Ak. 5: 197.

Judgments conforming to (10) are distinguished from affirmative judgments in
that they attribute a predicate to an object by denying another predicate of it at
the same time. They are, however, also distinguished from negative particular
judgments by the fact that they can be converted in the manner of affirmative
particular judgments, so that from a judgment conforming to schema (10), we can
derive a judgment that corresponds to the schema
(11) ‘some not-β is an α’.
Judgments corresponding to schema (11) present a concept of the form not-β as
satisfied (non-empty), since they affirm of an object (with the predicate α) the
predicate not-β. In this way they attribute to the concept not-β a scope that is so
large that, with the exception of the conceptual scope of β, the scope of every other
concept is at least partially contained in it. I call this type of ascription of concep-
tual scope, following the nomenclature introduced by Kant, limitation.28 Judg-
ments which determine the scope of a concept through limitation can accordingly
be called limitative judgments. There are not only particular limitative judgments,
that is, judgments whose form correspond to the schema (10), but also universal
and singular limitative judgments, i.e., judgments of the form ‘every α is a not-β’
or ‘that α is a not-β’. Thus, a proposition corresponding to propositional schema
(9) entails a singular limitative judgment of the form ‘that α is a not-β’ as a clause.
Judgments of this form, as well as their corresponding universal limitative judg-
ments, are like negative judgments in that they deny to objects a predicate β; but
they are also like affirmative judgments in that convertible particular judgments
are derivable from them.29
The form of the limitative judgment can be understood as a logical quality,
and as such should be grouped together with the forms of the affirmative and
negative judgment.
However, the limitative form plays only a subordinate role in the syllogistic,
since limitative judgments can in many (or even most) cases be treated as special
cases of affirmative judgments. Namely, the propositional schema of an affirmative
judgment can be readily produced in all cases by transformation, simply by replac-
ing the concept expression schema ‘not-α’ in the schema of the limitative judgment
with a lower-case Greek letter, e.g., with ‘β’ here. After all, the expression schema
‘not-α’ stands merely for specific conceptual contents, which can also be represented
by ‘β’. Considered in this way, the schema of a limitative proposition contains a
Schmid, “Limitation” (1798, 315). Cf. Sigwart 1889, 153.
I will treat the relevant conversion rules systematically in the third section of Part III of this
book.

schema for a concept expression instead of a concept variable. This schema does
not represent any arbitrary term but can rather stand only for such concept expres-
sions which designate the antonym of another concept in terms of their content.
However, this way of considering them does not warrant us in regarding the linguis-
tic expressions that can be used to represent antonyms as non-syllogistic vocabu-
lary. For according to the criterion which I adduced above to distinguish syllogistic
from non-syllogistic modes of expression, every limitative propositional schema can
be considered as a syllogistic one, since they contain no object variables apart from
concept variables and no expression occurs in them apart from what is necessary to
represent conceptual hierarchies. Considered in this way, a limitative propositional
schema is distinguished from other syllogistic propositional schemata only in that
its logical vocabulary is suited to present conceptual relations that cannot be pre-
sented with the vocabulary of other syllogistic propositional schemata.30
Thus, the list of logical constants that syllogistic utilizes is to be expanded
with the expression by which the propositional schemata (9) and (10) are distin-
guished from the schemata of affirmative and negative propositions, namely with
the expression
‘. . . is a not- . . .’.
If we pay attention to the constellation of words which occur in the logical con-
stants used for affirmation, negation, and limitation, ‘. . . is a . . .’, ‘. . . is not a . . .’,
‘. . . is a not- . . .’, then it is striking in comparing these constants that affirmation
is expressed by the lack of a negating expression (‘not’) or by the lack of a priva-
tive prefix (‘not-’). In colloquial contexts, there is no lack of words for express-
ing or emphasizing an affirmation or the affirmative character of a proposition.
In German, for example, the word ‘doch’ is available, a word which can be used
syntactically just like ‘not’ and which serves to indicate a discrepancy between
an affirmative statement and its previous denial or an expected denial. Even in
symbolic logical languages, there is no lack of expressions which aid in making
affirmations explicit. Thus, in traditional presentations of syllogistic since the
Middle Ages the first two vowels A and I of the Latin verb affirmo are used to desig-
nate the affirmation of a universal or particular statement, while both vowels E
and O of the verb nego serve to designate the negation of such statements.
Syllogistic rules which can be applied to affirmative judgments remain valid when these judg-
ments are replaced by limitative judgments. This does not mean, however, that all valid syllogis-
tic rules which hold for limitative judgments are reducible to other rules.

§ 5 Categorical Form
Just as the absence of ‘not . . .’ and ‘not- . . .’ can indicate an affirmation, so the
absence of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ and ‘either . . ., or . . .’ in proposition schemata (1) to
(4) (‘every β is an α,’ ‘every γ is not a β,’ ‘some α is a γ,’ ‘some α is not a δ’) can
indicate the schemata of categorical propositions. However, since in accordance
with § 2 concept variables can stand for nominal phrases of arbitrary complexity
and can be composed of propositions of arbitrary complexity, it is possible that
categorical propositions can consist of several sub-propositions, including hypo-
thetical or disjunctive propositions. Thus, e.g., the following inference consists of
nothing but categorical propositions:
Every dog who wags his tail when he approaches his master is a brave animal.
No dog who is berated by his master is a brave animal.
Therefore: No dog who is berated by his master is a dog who wags his tail when he
approaches his master.
This is a typical categorical inference, which is valid not according to the rules of
hypothetical but of categorical inference. It is inessential for the form of the cate-
gorical judgment whether it is represented by a proposition composed of sub-
propositions or not. What is essential for its form is rather that this proposition
satisfies two conditions: first, that it is not part of a hypothetical or disjunctive
proposition, but rather has logical independence; and second, that it renders a re-
lationship between exactly two concepts which can be represented by logical con-
stants such as, e.g., ‘every . . . is a . . .’, and in that way possesses logical simplicity.
In this connection, it is necessary to distinguish grammatically simple proposi-
tions from logically simple propositions. Propositions are grammatically simple when
they are not composed of other propositions (with the help of relative pronouns or
conjunctions); they thus neither consist of several main clauses nor are they proposi-
tions, which consist of a main clause and at least one subordinate clause. By contrast,
propositions are logically simple only if they connect two concept expressions with
the help of logical constants. The logical simplicity of propositions in no way pre-
cludes that they consist of several propositions grammatically.31
The view espoused by Frege in § 4 of his Begriffsschrift that “The distinction of judgments
into categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive seems to me to have only grammatical signifi-
cance,” ultimately depends on a (unfortunately significant) confusion of grammatical and logical
simplicity. For a more precise discussion, see M. Wolff 2006, 272–85.

Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

In the syllogistic tradition of logic, the designation categorical proposition
was introduced for logically simple propositions which are not part of a hypothet-
ical or disjunctive proposition. Their syntactic position outside of a hypothetical
or disjunctive proposition guarantees categorical propositions a certain type of
logical independence, which in addition to logical simplicity is the second essential
characteristic of categorical propositions. If one dispenses with this second char-
acteristic and considers, as sometimes happens, logical simplicity as a sufficient
mark of categorical propositions, then we get the view that hypothetical and dis-
junctive propositions can consist of categorical sub-propositions. However, with
this view a characteristic property of categorical propositions is lost, namely that
they do not, like hypothetical or disjunction propositions, attribute predicates to
objects or say something of something conditionally, but rather unconditionally,
indeed categorically (from the Greek κατηγοϱεῖν = to say something of some-
thing). Let p be a logically simple subject-predicate proposition and let it occur,
e.g., in two places of a modus ponendo ponens inference, namely, as the anteced-
ent of the first premise ‘if p, then q’ and as the second premise p, so that q is the
conclusion. Then, in terms of content, the same proposition p may be present in two
places, but what p says of objects unconditionally (categorically) in the second
premise, p says only conditionally in the first premise (namely, only on the condi-
tion that q is not denied, but is a true proposition).32 Hence, in terms of content,
categorical judgments lie “at the basis of all other [judgments],” as Kant says in the
Prolegomena, § 39 (Ak. 4: 325). For as logically simple subject-predicate-judgments
they provide as it were the fabric for logically complex judgments. But they per-
form their function as categorical judgments only in virtue of the syntactic position
they require as logically independent judgments.33
Likewise, in ‘if p, then q’ q is stated on the condition that q. Incidentally, this also comports
with Kant’s conception of the hypothetical judgment. See his Logic, § 25, remark 2 (Ak. 9: 106).
The view that Günther Patzig advances in his essay “Die logischen Formen praktischer Sätze in
Kants Ethik” (1994, 214) that Kant’s conception of the hypothetical judgment as a “conditional”
mode of judgment is “incompatible” with Kant’s “standard explanation,” according to which the
hypothetical judgment states a “consequence” of the statement of the consequent from that of
the antecedent (CPR, § 9), is unfounded. Kant’s standard explanation implies this conception, as
one can easily make clear and as the ancient Peripatetics had already seen. For the relevant
references to sources in the ancient literature, see Prantl (1855, vol. 1, 383–88).
The marks of logical simplicity and logical independence can of course also be applied to hy-
pothetical and disjunctive judgments. That is, there are logically simple and logically indepen-
dent hypothetical and disjunctive propositions, namely, judgments in which the logical constants
of the respective hypothetical or disjunctive proposition occur exactly once. But the marks of log-
ical simplicity and logical independence are not constitutive for these judgments, since there can
also be logically complex and thus logically dependent hypothetical and disjunctive judgments.
1 The Language of the Assertoric Syllogistic § 5
13

As the form of logically independent subject-predicate propositions, categori-
cal form, much like the hypothetical or disjunctive form, has to do with a logical
relation, yet it is one whose relata are not judgments, as with the hypothetical or
disjunctive relation, but rather concepts. Every categorical judgment has to do
with an ordered pair of concepts, one of which is to be regarded as the subject
concept, the other as the predicate concept of the judgment. The logical distinction
between the subject and predicate concept of a judgment corresponds to the
grammatical subject-predicate distinction but does not coincide with it. Grammat-
ically, every simple declarative proposition that is not composed of other proposi-
tions can be analyzed into subject and predicate. The grammatical subject of a
proposition stands for that about which the proposition says something. The
grammatical predicate stands for what it says about something. ‘All humans are
mortal’, for example, is a declarative proposition which says of all humans that
they are mortal. Hence, the component ‘all humans’ is its grammatical subject,
while the remainder of the proposition, ‘are mortal’, is its grammatical predi-
cate.34 But the dissection of a proposition into grammatical subject and grammati-
cal predicate does not coincide with the analysis of a logically simple proposition
into its logical subject, its logical predicate, and its logical constants.35 From a logi-
cal perspective, the proposition ‘All humans are mortal’ says the same thing as
‘Every human is a mortal being’. In the conception of the syllogistic tradition,
‘human’ is here the logical subject, ‘mortal being’ the logical predicate. Accord-
ingly, in the traditional conception the proposition has the logical form ‘every S is
a P’. Logical subject and logical predicate, whose positions are designated here
with ‘S’ and ‘P’, have, grammatically, a common form: they are both expressions
that can be preceded by a definite or indefinite article; and because of their com-
mon grammatical form their positions in the proposition can be interchanged.
They are distinguished merely by this syntactic position. They are thus distin-
guished in that the logical subject is part of a grammatical subject, and the logi-
cal predicate is part of a grammatical predicate. Since the logical subject can
Traditional grammar, taking its orientation from Latin, counts not only auxiliary verbs and
predicate names (predicatives) as belonging to the predicate, but also adverbs, object expres-
sions, and any other expression that belongs to a subject-predicate proposition but not to its
grammatical subject.
Frege pointed out in his 1879 Begriffsschrift that the subject-predicate distinction that is stan-
dard in the syllogistic is not directly applicable to functional expressions in quantificational
logic. From this finding, he could have actually concluded that one should speak of logical subject
and predicate only in the sense in which the syllogistic intends the distinction between subject
and predicate. This would have been reasonable as well. In §§ 27–28 below, I will show how the
traditional grammatical subject-predicate distinction can be applied to quantified functional
expressions.

Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

exchange its position in the proposition with that of the logical predicate, every
subject concept of a categorical proposition is suited to act as predicate concept
in other categorical propositions. This is why certain categorical judgments can
be joined together in a modus Barbara inference and why it is permissible to
pass immediately (by mere conversion) from ‘no α is a β’ to ‘no β is an α’.
Unlike the forms of the hypothetical and disjunctive judgment, the categorical
form presents no occasion to extend the list of logical constants assembled above.
For this form is expressed not by using a certain logical vocabulary but only by
the syntax according to which, within a logically simple proposition that is not
part of a hypothetical or disjunctive proposition, pairs of expressions which are
represented by concept variables are ordered.
The fact that categorical judgments are logically simple and logically indepen-
dent subject-predicate propositions that do not occur as part of hypothetical or
disjunctive propositions, does not preclude them from taking the position of a
subordinate clause. For it changes nothing pertaining to logical form (i.e., the logi-
cal simplicity and independence of categorical propositions), when they are em-
bedded in the expression ‘it is true that . . .’, ‘it is possible that . . .’, and ‘it is
necessary that . . .’. Nor does anything change in the logical form of hypothetical
and disjunctive propositions through such an embedding.
2 The Language of the Modal Syllogistic
§ 6 The Logical Vocabulary of the Modal Syllogistic
One can understand the expressions
‘it is true that . . .’,
‘it is possible that . . .’,
‘it is necessary that . . .’
in such a way that they are equivalent to ‘it is actually (in fact) true that. . .’, ‘it is
possibly true that . . .’, or ‘it is necessarily true that . . .’, respectively. Understood in
this way, these logical constants express distinctions in alethic modality. Propositions
which are introduced by one of the three enumerated modal expressions are called
assertoric, problematic, and apodictic, respectively.36
As such, these expressions must be distinguished from similar sounding expressions of deon-
tic or epistemic modality, i.e., from expressions like ‘it is permissible that . . .’, ‘it is forbidden
that . . .’ or ‘it can be supposed that . . .’, ‘it is known that . . .’, etc. See Appendix 9.
2 The Language of the Modal Syllogistic § 6
15

These expressions, which did not previously occur in my list of logical con-
stants, can be counted among the syllogistic vocabulary for the following reasons.
Concerning first the expression ‘it is true that . . .’, all previously enumerated
propositional schemata ((1) to (11)) can be embedded in it. In this way they are
converted (from being schemata of implicitly assertoric propositions) into sche-
mata of (explicitly) assertoric propositions. Such a conversion changes nothing in
the truth of the propositions corresponding to the logical form of schemata (1) to
(11). Namely, every true non-modalized (i.e., not introduced by one of the three
modal expressions) proposition A is an expression from which a proposition of
the form ‘it is true that A’ logically follows.37 For if A is true, the statement that A
is true cannot be false. In addition, all valid inferences maintain their validity
when one adds to their premises as well as to their conclusions (so long as they
are not apodictic or problematic propositions) the prefix ‘it is true that . . .’. For
the same reason, the validity of all inferences is preserved if one sets aside this
prefix in all places of its occurrence. Since this prefix only emphasizes a property
which is presupposed anyway in every (including every non-modalized) premise
of an inference, one often already designates non-modalized premises as asser-
toric. This is precisely the reason that the label ‘assertoric syllogistic’ has arisen
for that part of the syllogistic which entirely disregards inferences from modal-
ized, especially apodictic or problematic, premises. Connected with this is the fact
that the expression ‘it is true that . . .’ (or an equivalent expression) has mostly
not been treated as a logical constant in traditional treatments of the syllogistic at
all. Even so, this does not speak against regarding it as a part of the logical vocab-
ulary of the syllogistic.
There is a systematic reason for the adoption of the expressions ‘it is necessary
that . . .’ and ‘it is possible that . . .’ in the list of logical constants as well. For
just as the proposition ‘it is true that p’ can be directly deductively derived
from p, so can the proposition ‘it is possible that p’, and p in turn can be
If one takes only the propositional schemata (1) to (11) into consideration, one may say that
this consequence relation also goes in the other direction. But this does not mean, strictly speak-
ing, that the same holds for propositions of arbitrary content. Rather, whether a proposition of
the form ‘not p’ follows logically from a proposition of the form ‘it is true that p’ depends on the
meaning of the negation sign. As will emerge below (in § 10), there is a truth-ambivalent, para-
consistent use of negation which precludes the logical equivalence of ‘A’ and ‘It is true that A’.
Hence the expression ‘it is true that . . .’ is not, or at least not in all cases, simply redundant, as is
often supposed. This issue can be set aside for the moment. However, it is not unimportant to
take heed of it in a precise way. Alfred Tarski has shown that this equivalence is not applicable
without contradiction to every colloquial statement. He thereby questioned “even the possibility
of a consistent use of the expression ‘true statement’ that thereby agrees with the principles of
logic and the spirit of common speech”. See Tarski 1935, 458.
16
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

derived from the proposition ‘it is necessary that p’. In other words: ‘it is possi-
ble that p’ is a logical weakening of the proposition p according to the scholas-
tic rule ab esse ad posse valet consequentia, just as p is a logical weakening of
the proposition ‘it is necessary that p’ according to the scholastic rule a necesse
esse ad esse valet consequentia. Since these rules can be directly applied to
every syllogistic propositional schema and remain valid in this application, it
has not been merely convenient but also always standard to adopt the expres-
sions ‘it is possible that . . .’ and ‘it is necessary that . . .’ into the logical vocab-
ulary of the syllogistic.
Alethic modalities are called de dicto modalities because they state the actual,
possible, or necessary truth of propositions (dicta). Yet statements about the possi-
ble or necessary truth of propositions can also be understood as statements about
the possibility or necessity of the states of affairs these propositions are about. If
the propositions are categorical propositions, the prefixes added to them ‘it is pos-
sible that . . .’ and ‘it is necessary that . . .’ can also be understood as dealing with
de re possibility or de re necessity, respectively. Thus, a proposition of the form ‘it
is possible that every α is a β’ can be understood such that it means the same
thing as: ‘for every α it is possible to be a β’ or ‘every α is possibly a β’. Quite
generally, problematic categorical propositions can be understood as attributing
to a thing (res) a possibility. Analogously, apodictic categorical propositions can
be understood as saying of something (de re) that a predicate belongs to it
necessarily.
Within the syllogistic, categorical modal statements are of interest to the
same extent as it is of interest when we consider hierarchical conceptual arrange-
ments to distinguish cases in which objects of a certain kind fall under a concept
β in all thinkable circumstances (and thus necessarily) from cases in which this
does not hold under all thinkable circumstances (thus not necessarily). For con-
ceptual divisions cannot be conducted only on the basis of problematic categori-
cal propositions without further ado. Thus, e.g., the proposition ‘for every human
it is possible to sleep’ does not preclude this proposition from being true as well:
‘for every human it is possible not to sleep’. If a stable classification system is to
be rendered in a conceptual division, it is not enough to present conceptual rela-
tionships in non-modalized form according to the pattern of Figure 1 in § 1. For
categorical statements whose logical form corresponds to one of syllogistic sche-
mata (1) to (4) are as such only suited to classify objects through the subordination
of concepts conditionally. Thus, a proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’ indeed
subordinates the concept α under the concept β, but its form does not preclude that
it is possible that objects that fall under the concept α do not fall under the concept
β. In that way, it does not yet say anything at all about whether β is a stable super-
ordinate concept of α and suited to classify the objects falling under α. It rather
2 The Language of the Modal Syllogistic § 6
17

leaves it open whether β stands for a contingent property of the objects falling
under α. Namely, non-modalized statements are not always statements which, if
true, always follow from corresponding apodictic statements, so that they would be
logical weakenings of such statements. Rather, if a non-modalized proposition (e.g.,
a proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’) is true and β stands for a contingent prop-
erty of the objects falling under α, then a problematic proposition of the form ‘for
every α it is possible not to be β’ is also true. And the latter proposition stands in
contradiction to the apodictic strengthening of the first non-modalized proposition,
i.e., to a corresponding proposition of the form ‘for every α it is necessary to be a
β’. In contrast, if a non-modalized proposition (e.g., a proposition of the form ‘every
α is a β’) is true and β stands for a necessary (non-contingent) property of the ob-
jects falling under α, then there must be a corresponding apodictic proposition
(namely, a proposition of the form ‘for every α it is necessary to be a β’) from
which the non-modalized proposition follows as the latter’s logical weakening.38
As these considerations show, the inclusion of the modal expressions ‘it is
necessary that . . .’ and ‘it is possible that . . .’ as well as the inclusion of the de re
variants of these expressions (‘. . . necessarily . . .’ or ‘. . . possibly . . .’) in the logi-
cal vocabulary of the syllogistic is already demanded because we depend on the
use of modal vocabulary to make explicit the just described double meaning of
non-modalized syllogistic propositional schemata and to correct corresponding
ambiguities in the use of non-modal logical constants. Once this modal vocabulary
is introduced into the syllogistic, the question immediately arises about which de-
ductive inferences depend for their validity on the meaning of the expressions of
this vocabulary alone. The same question comes up with respect to the rest of the
logical vocabulary of the syllogistic, and I will return to it in Part II of this book.
But are all modal expressions relevant for the syllogistic already captured in
the logical vocabulary I have described so far? One could suppose that by forming
antonyms of ‘true’, ‘possible’, and ‘necessary’ three further logical constants can
be immediately produced, namely: ‘it is non-true that . . .’, ‘it is impossible that
. . .’, and ‘it is non-necessary that . . .’. These constants can be interpreted so that
they are equivalent in sequence with the expressions
Wolfgang Wieland (1966, 55) has argued that in the Aristotelian syllogistic the weakening
rule, according to which a non-modalized proposition of the form A follows from an apodictic
proposition of the form ‘it is necessary that A’, is invalid, since Aristotle always uses assertoric
and non-modalized statements in his doctrine of necessary inferences “when he wants to assert
the realization of one – among several – possibilities.” Ulrich Nortmann has criticized this view
with convincing arguments in Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 441–43. The validity of the mentioned
weakening rule in no way precludes there being assertoric and non-modalized statements in
which the realization of a possibility, which can also not be realized, is claimed.
18
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

‘it is false that . . .’,
‘it is impossibly true that . . .’, and
‘it is contingent(ly true) that . . .’.
I would like to consider these somewhat more precisely one by one, in order to
examine how much interest they may have for the syllogistic.
A proposition of the form ‘it is false that p’ is equivalent to ‘it is not true that
p’, in any case so long as one assumes the validity of the bivalence principle, ac-
cording to which there is no other truth value besides true or false. On this as-
sumption, the expressions ‘it is non-true that . . .’, ‘it is false that . . .’, and ‘it is not
true that . . .’ can be interchanged and are not to be regarded as special logical
constants but simply as expressions of de dicto negation, i.e., negation of an ex-
plicitly assertoric proposition. I will get into the reasons for regarding the biva-
lence principle as valid in the syllogistic in § 8 below, as well as in Appendix 8.
The use of a de dicto negation is dispensable in the syllogistic for the same reason
that the use of ‘it is true that . . .’ is dispensable. Since ‘it is true that p’ follows
logically from p, likewise ‘not p’ (i.e., the de re negation of p) follows from ‘it is not
true that p’. Nothing in the validity of syllogistic inferences alters when all de
dicto negations that occur in their premises and conclusions are replaced with de
re negations.39
Neither is a new logical constant introduced with the expression ‘it is impos-
sible that . . .’. After all, since a proposition is possibly true if and only if its truth
is not impossible, this expression merely denies the possible truth of a proposi-
tion. It is thus equivalent to ‘it is not possibly true that . . .’. Moreover, as an ex-
pression of the negation of a problematic proposition, it is equivalent to the
apodictic expression ‘it is necessarily true that not . . .’. For the impossibility of
the truth of a proposition consists just in that its negation is necessarily true.
Accordingly, that the negation of a proposition is possibly true can be ren-
dered by the negation of an apodictic proposition. The modal expression ‘it is not
necessarily true that . . .’ is thus equivalent to ‘it is possibly true that not . . .’.
The expression ‘it is contingently true that . . .’ is different from this in that it
does not only negate the necessary truth of a proposition (and thereby immedi-
ately assert the possible truth of a negative proposition corresponding to it), but
beyond this also negates the impossible truth of this proposition (and thereby im-
mediately asserts the possible truth of the negative proposition corresponding to
it). In this way, the expression ‘it is contingently true that . . .’ combines both
problematic de dicto expressions, ‘it is possible that . . .’ and ‘it is possible that
The fact that de re and de dicto negations are not used equivalently in every respect and in all
circumstances does not need to concern us further for now. I will return to this issue in §§ 8–10.

19

not . . .’, and is thus logically stronger than either of these expressions on their
own. Yet it should be noticed that this combination cannot pertain to every arbi-
trary pair of problematic propositions of which one is the contrary of the other.
Rather, this combination pertains always only to such pairs of propositions in
which both problematic propositions are both either universal or particular or
singular. Thus, e.g., the (universal) propositional schema ‘it is contingently true
that every α is a β’ combines the (universal) propositional schema ‘it is possibly
true that every α is a β’ along with (likewise universal) propositional schema ‘it is
possibly true that not every α is a β’, yet not the (particular) propositional schema
‘it is possibly true that not every α is a β’. Similarly, the (particular) propositional
schema ‘it is contingently true that some α is a β’ implies the (likewise particular)
propositional schema ‘it is possibly true that some α is not a β’, but not the (uni-
versal) proposition schema ‘it is possibly true that not any α is a β’. Only when the
quantity of both propositional schemata agrees is the de dicto contingency (repre-
sented by ‘it is contingent(ly true) that . . .’) equivalent to a corresponding de re
contingency, represented by ‘. . . is contingently a . . .’. For only in this case are
both problematic de re expressions ‘. . . is possibly a . . .’ and ‘. . . is possibly not a
. . .’ combined by the de re expression ‘. . . is contingently a . . .’. Accordingly,
every proposition of the form ‘it is contingent(ly true) that A’, as well as every
proposition which contains such a proposition as a clause, can be regarded as ab-
breviating a combination of a pair of propositions that are problematic or contain
such propositions as clauses.40
From my analysis of the three expressions
‘it is false that. . .’,
‘it is impossibly true that. . .’, and
‘it is contingent(ly true) that. . .’,
The fact that contingent propositions are equivalent to a pair of problematic propositions en-
ables one to recognize that the modality of contingent propositions is a second kind of possibility.
Along the same lines, Aristotle distinguishes in An. pr. 1. 13 two meanings of the word “possible.”
According to the first meaning, the possible is the contingent, namely, “[what] is not necessary
but nothing impossible will result if it is put as being the case” (An. pr. 32 a 18–20 [1989, 18]).
According to the second meaning, the possible is a logical weakening of the necessary; according
to this meaning, one can say of the necessary “that it is possible” (32 a 20–21 [1989, 18]). In the
literature on Aristotle, the modality of contingent propositions is called ‘two-sided possibility’,
while the modality of simple problematic propositions is called ‘one-sided possibility’. The kinds
of possibility statement distinguished in this way can be regarded as logical weakenings of two
kinds of assertoric statement: on the one hand, of statements which deal with the factual or ac-
tual, which is the realization of a possibility, but which might not have been realized; on the
other hand, of statements which deal with the factual or actual but as itself a logical weakening
of apodictic statements.
20
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

we find that, if one assumes the validity of the bivalence principle, they contain
no logical vocabulary whose meaning could not be made explicit by means of the
logical vocabulary I have already introduced. There is thus no compelling reason
to add these expressions to the vocabulary that expresses the distinction between
assertoric, problematic, and apodictic propositions.
There is, however, also no reason to reduce the modal vocabulary any further
than this. It may be true that the expressions ‘it is possible that not . . .’ and ‘it is
not necessary that . . .’ are equivalent, just as the expressions ‘it is not possible that
. . .’ and ‘it is necessary that not . . .’ are equivalent, and thus that the expressions
‘it is necessary that . . .’ and ‘it is not possible that not . . .’ and likewise the expres-
sions ‘it is possible that . . .’ and ‘it is not necessary that not . . .’ are pairwise equiv-
alents. But since neither the expression ‘it is possible that . . .’ nor ‘it is necessary
that . . .’ has a noticeable privilege over the other, they have equal interest for
the syllogistic and hence should be adopted in its list of the logical constants.41
Accordingly, if A is a syllogistic propositional schema, then the expressions ‘it is
necessary that A’ and ‘it is possible that A’ can be regarded as equally legitimate
propositional schemata.
Finally, concerning distinctions in the de dicto and de re use of modal expres-
sions (e.g., the use of ‘possibly’ in ‘it is possibly true that . . .’ and ‘. . . is possibly a
. . .’), it suffices to establish for the time being that though these distinctions may
well concern grammar, they need not affect the meaning of these expressions
The content of this list agrees with the content of the table of judgments with which Kant
claimed to provide a systematic division and complete enumeration of elementary logical forms.
This agreement is not accidental, but rather rests on the fact that Kant developed the content of
the table of judgments on the basis of a description of what he called the ‘logical use of the un-
derstanding’ – the usus logicus intellectus. Kant understood this latter as consisting in the use of
concepts in judging insofar as these concepts are related to each other in subordination relation-
ships. See M. Wolff 1995, 192–94. The twelve forms of the table of judgments are in Kant’s view
elementary logical forms in the sense that they can be combined into more complex forms. Each
of the proposition schemata (1) to (11) enumerated above represents a complex logical form; and
if the issue is the logical form of a judgment, then we typically mean a form composed of several
elementary forms. The fact that Kant’s table of judgments is only supposed to contain elementary
forms has sometimes been missed by logicians. Thus, Arthur N. Prior (1967b, 549) supposes that
Kant’s division according to quality is “absurd”: “where would one put, for example, the forms ‘X
is-not not-Y’ and ‘Not-X is Y’?” If we interpret the examples of propositional schemata Prior
brings in as schemata of predicative propositions (not as examples of schemata for identity prop-
ositions), then the first example (according to Kant’s approach) pertains to assertoric, quantita-
tively indefinite, categorical propositions, in which the forms of negative and limitative
judgments are combined. The second example pertains to assertoric, quantitatively indefinite,
categorical, affirmative propositions, which result from infinite propositions through conversion,
just as particular propositions result from universal propositions through conversion.

when they are applied to syllogistic propositional schemata. This holds in any case
for the modal expressions of problematic, apodictic, and contingent propositions.
De dicto and de re expressions of the same modality are to that extent equivalent.
(See also Appendix 7.)
§ 7 The Indispensability of the Logical Vocabulary of the Modal Syllogistic
However, to pursue the question of whether the logical vocabulary of the syllogis-
tic can be translated into a non-syllogistic formal language that is suitable for
other parts of deductive logic, we do not need to draw attention to modal expres-
sions, or at least not in the first instance. For even to make explicit the meaning
of (non-modal) syllogistic vocabulary with the help of a non-syllogistic formal lan-
guage, one will in no way be able to dispense with the use of the modal vocabu-
lary of the syllogistic. We can preliminarily clarify this relative indispensability of
the expressions of the modal syllogistic in the following way.
I already pointed out in § 3 that the ‘if-then’ connection of the hypothetical
proposition expresses a consequence relation that obtains between a proposition p
and a consequent q if and only if it is impossible that the statement of its anteced-
ent is true and the statement of its consequent false. For this reason, we should
understand a hypothetical proposition of the form ‘if p, then q’ as equivalent to a
proposition of the form ‘it is impossible that p and not q’. The propositional schema
‘it is impossible that A and not B’ is, as it seems, not a syllogistic propositional
schema (even if A and B are themselves such schemata). For it contains at least one
logical constant, namely ‘. . . and . . .’, which according to § 1 should not (or not
without further ado) be assumed to belong to the logical vocabulary of the syllogis-
tic. In this way, it does look as though one can translate the schema of a hypotheti-
cal proposition into a language which contains non-syllogistic vocabulary. But it is,
at least so it seems, also unavoidable in this translation to make use of the vocabu-
lary of the modal syllogistic. For though ‘it is impossible that . . .’ can be replaced
by a different modal expression, namely by ‘it is necessary that not . . .’, it cannot (so
it seems) be replaced by an expression in which no constant of the modal syllogistic
occurs at all. This fact leads us to expect that at least hypothetical propositional sche-
mata can be translated into a non-syllogistic language only if this language has
adopted the modal vocabulary of the syllogistic.
Modern, non-syllogistic modal logic can be described such that it makes use
of at least one of the syllogistic expressions of alethic modality, but it connects
this usage with the use of a truth-functional vocabulary. It arose from the seman-
tics of the hypothetical proposition and originated in the logical work of Clarence
Irving Lewis as the logic of strict implication. Following Hugh MacColl, Lewis
22
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

interpreted the form of the hypothetical proposition ‘if A, then B’ as equivalent to
‘it is impossible that A is true and B false’.42 He assumed (Lewis & Langford 1932,
123) that according to this interpretation the form could be presented in symbolic
notation with an expression which corresponds to the following schema:
‘~ ◇(A & ~ B)’.
In this schema, ‘. . . & . . .’ stands for logical conjunction (‘. . . and . . .’), the tilde
‘~ . . .’ expresses negation, and the diamond sign ‘◇. . .’ can be considered an ab-
breviation for ‘it is possible that . . .’. The logical constants ‘. . . & . . .’ and ‘~ . . .’ are
used in this schema as truth-functional signs. That is, ‘A & B’ and ‘~ A’ are schemata
for truth functions. Truth functions are to be understood as those functions whose
values are truth values and whose arguments are statements which have a truth
value. If p, q, and r are statements which are true or false, then p & q and ~ r are
functions whose truth value depends only on the truth values of p, q, and r. In con-
trast to ‘. . . & . . .’ and ‘~ . . .’, however, neither ‘◇. . .’ nor ‘if . . ., then . . .’ is a
truth functional sign. Namely, if a proposition fills the empty place of ‘◇. . .’, then
its truth will be counted by the prefixed modal sign as possible truth, and its possible
truth obviously does not depend on which truth value it actually has. Similarly, the
truth of a hypothetical proposition does not depend on the truth values of its sub-
propositions alone. For such a proposition is true, as we have seen, only if it is not
possible that its consequent is false and its antecedent true.
Lewis called the relation he accepted between the clauses of a hypothetical
proposition of the form ‘if A, then B’ strict implication, and to abbreviate ‘~ ◇(A
& ~ B)’ he introduced the expression
‘A ⥽B’.
Modern axiomatic modal logic has come about because Lewis, on the basis of the
definition of strict implication, established various axiomatic systems whose
basic formulas include the three logical constants ‘. . . & . . .’, ‘~ . . .’, and ‘◇. . .’
as the only as undefined signs.43 ‘It is necessary that . . .’ is replaced in this lan-
guage by ‘~ ◇~ . . .’; ‘it is impossible that . . .’ is rendered in this language with
‘~ ◇. . .’.
We must thus ask of the three signs ‘. . . & . . .’, ‘~ . . .’, and ‘◇. . .’ how they
relate to the logical vocabulary of the syllogistic.

3 Analysis of Expressions of Negation
§ 8 The Bivalence Principle
At first glance, apparently only ‘. . . & . . .’ is a sign that cannot be read as an ab-
breviation for one of the constants of the syllogistic as enumerated above. As a
truth-functional sign, it connects two propositions to each other so that the propo-
sition which arises out of this connection is true if and only if the connected pro-
positions are true, while it is false whenever one of its sub-propositions is false.
By contrast, the signs ‘~ . . .’, and ‘◇. . .’ suggest a comparison with syllogistic
vocabulary. If it is defined no further, ‘◇. . .’ can simply mean the same thing as
the expression of the modal syllogistic ‘it is possible that . . .’. In systems of modal
logic which use the defined sign ‘□. . .’ (‘it is necessary that. . .’) as an abbrevia-
tion of ‘~ ◇~ . . .’, however, it is standard to equate the meaning of ‘◇. . .’ with
the meaning of ‘~ □~ . . .’.44 Whether ‘◇. . .’ and ‘□. . .’ in these systems are
equivalent to the modal expressions of the syllogistic depends partly on how
‘~ . . .’ as a sign for truth-functional negation relates to syllogistic negation, and
partly on how ‘~ ◇. . .’ and ‘~ □. . .’ relate to the syllogistic modal expressions ‘it is
impossible that . . .’ and ‘it is not necessary that . . .’.
Regarding the relationship of the sign for truth-functional negation to syllogis-
tic negation, we first need an answer to the question of whether ‘not A’ taken as a
syllogistic schema of a negative proposition is a truth-functional expression or not.
One should not dismiss this question in the opinion that every negation of a
proposition is a truth-functional negation.45 For this opinion is not tenable with-
out further justification. Consider, for example, the following propositions:
(a)
‘the greatest number is not greater than a thousand’ and
(b)
‘the greatest number is greater than a thousand’.
Proposition (a) negates (the content of) proposition (b) in a certain respect. But
proposition (a) does not contain a de dicto negation of proposition (b), and thus
does not say explicitly that (b) is false; rather, proposition (a) contains only a de
re negation regarding the greatest number.46
The sign ‘□. . .’ was introduced as an abbreviation for ‘~ ◇~ . . .’ by Ruth C. Barcan (1946, 12).
Cf. Hughes & Cresswell 1977, 347.
Very many logic books unfortunately do just this, as if there were only truth-functional negations.
In those which do not do this, a systematic treatment of kinds of negation is for the most part lacking.
The distinction encountered here between two kinds of negation is similar to the distinction
Fred Sommers has introduced between “denying a predicate” and “negating a sentence”, though
not exactly. Predicate negation for Sommers consists in the use of terms of the form ‘not-α’. See
24
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

To be able to analyze what it is to negate a proposition (or its content) without
negating it in the sense of a de dicto negation, we first should know what it would be
to say that proposition (b) is false. To say a proposition is false means at least: saying
it is not true. Supposing the word ‘false’ is used as synonymous with ‘not true’, it suffi-
ces for the truth of a de dicto negation that the negated proposition is not true.
Of course, no one is prevented from using the word ‘false’ in a different way:
one may treat both propositions (a) and (b) as if they were not false but rather
meaningless – namely, neither true nor false – since they deal with something that
does not exist. Yet then one assumes a usage in which ‘false’ and ‘not true’ are not
synonyms. We should not attempt here to decide which usage is correct, since
one can use words however one likes. But we can (and should) stick to a usage
once we have chosen it (at least in a scientific treatment).
In the following, I will use ‘false’ and ‘not true’ as equivalent expressions and
precisely for that reason will assume that a declarative proposition which is not true
is false. I call this assumption, since it is fundamental, the bivalence principle. This
principle should be considered a semantic principle: it stipulates the meaning of the
word ‘false’, since it lets the falsity of a proposition consist in its not being true.
It follows from the bivalence principle that there is no truth value besides the
true and the false.47 This too follows from it: a proposition containing a de dicto
negation of proposition (b) is for its part already true if (b) is not true. Even proposi-
tion (a) is true or false, according to the bivalence principle. As a de re negation, it
does not need to be true if (b) is not true.48
§ 9 The Principle of Excluded Middle
The bivalence principle should not be confused with the principle of excluded mid-
dle.49 The latter principle does not merely stipulate the meaning of a word and is
thus not merely a semantic principle. It is also less fundamental than the bivalence
Sommers 1982, viii; 326–27; 340. De re negation is what Aristotle speaks about in De Interpretatione
17 a 26 (1984, 27), when he says: “[A] negation is a statement denying something of something.”
To avoid misunderstandings, one should say more precisely: The bivalence principle says
that for expressions which are used as declarative propositions, i.e., as judgments, there is no
truth value apart from true and false and that they must have at least one of these two values. I
provide a more extensive discussion of the bivalence principle below in Appendix 8. I will argue
there that the formality of formal logic is incompatible with the invalidity of this principle.
It is a widespread error to think that even “purely formally” “the negation of a false proposi-
tion [must] be true.” Patzig 1970, 83.
The confusion of the two principles can be found again and again, e.g., in Pirmin Stekeler-
Weithofer’s article “Satz vom ausgeschlossenen Dritten” (1992, 1198). By contrast, compare the
3 Analysis of Expressions of Negation § 9

principle. It plays the role of a basic logical supposition, by which it is assumed that
of two propositions of which one contradicts (or contradictorily negates) the other,
exactly one is true; tertium non datur [‘there is no third’]. Whether this supposition
is universally valid and thus holds for all negations depends on whether there are
negations which are not truth-functional (or contradictory negations).50
For truth-functional negations the principle of excluded middle is universally
valid and fundamental. This can be shown in the truth table for ~ A:
~ A
A
F
T
T
F
De dicto negations as well, provided they explicitly state that an affirmative prop-
osition is false, satisfy the principle of excluded middle and are contradictory or
truth-functional negations. It is a sufficient and necessary condition of their truth
that the negated proposition is not true. And it is false for its part if and only if
the negated affirmative proposition is true.
However, one can illustrate the fact that there are non-contradictory (non-
truth-functional) negations with the example of propositions (a) and (b) from § 8.
According to the bivalence principle both (a) and (b), as declarative proposi-
tions, have (at least) one of the two truth values. They also admit an interpreta-
tion which is incompatible with the principle of excluded middle, because they
do not contradict each other but are contrary, i.e., they are both false, even
though proposition (a) negates proposition (b). They are ostensibly to be taken as
singular propositions, which as such can only be true when they refer to a defi-
nite singular object. Since there is no question of a greatest number – whether
greater than a thousand or not – neither (a) nor (b) refers to a definite singular
object. Hence it is neither true that the greatest number is greater than a thou-
sand, nor is it true that the greatest number is not greater than a thousand.
What I have determined regarding the pair of propositions (a) and (b) holds
quite generally for any pair of singular propositions of the form ‘that α is a β’ and
clear and distinct manner in which Richard Purtill distinguishes between the two principles in
his articles “Principle of Bivalence” (1995a, 644) and “Principle of Excluded Middle” (1995b, 645).
Aristotle formulated the principle of excluded middle (without calling it thus) just so that it ap-
plies only to pairs of contradictory propositions: “But then neither is it possible for there to be any-
thing in the middle between contradictories, but it is necessary either to affirm or to deny one
thing, whatever it may be, of one thing” (Metaphysics 4. 7, 1011 b 24–25 [2016, 78]). Aristotle does
not provide an independent criterion for contradictoriness. (Cf. also Metaphysics 10. 7, 1057 a 33 ff.)
26
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

‘that α is not a β’. These pairs consist exclusively of false propositions if and only
if (with the same interpretation of α and β) a universally negative proposition is
true which states that no α is a β. The principle of excluded middle finds no appli-
cation to these pairs of propositions taken in general.
Note well that the principle of excluded middle is applicable to every pair of
propositions of which one truth-functionally or contradictorily negates the other.
This holds even with a pair of propositions which relate to each other as A and ~ A,
and A is the syllogistic schema of a singular affirmative proposition. In no interpre-
tation of the concept variables occurring in A can both A and ~ A be false. If one
replaces, e.g., the false proposition
(a) ‘the greatest number is not greater than a thousand’
with the truth-functional expression
(a′) ‘~ [the greatest number is greater than a thousand]’,
then a true proposition takes the place of a false one. For the sub-proposition
standing in the brackets of (a′) is false, and consequently (a′) is true according to
the principle of excluded middle.
§ 10 Truth-Functional and Non-Truth-Functional Negation
In order to make it clear that proposition (a) – as a false proposition – is not sup-
posed to be the translation of (a´), but rather a non-contradictory and non-truth-
functional negation of (b), we require an unambiguous terminology. Let A be a
formula which corresponds to the syllogistic schema of an affirmative or negative
proposition. Then I will use the designation ‘N A’ for the non-truth-functional ne-
gation of A. By ‘N A’ it is asserted that A is false, without also asserting, were A
equal to N B, that B is true. The meaning (or the use) of
‘N . . .’
can be fixed by way of definition51 so that, for every interpretation in which A
and B are true or false proposition, the following holds:
A definition as it is made here (and in what follows, for the use of logical constants other
than N) I call a use-definition, where it is permitted to make use in the definiens of the sign whose
use is the subject of the definition.
3 Analysis of Expressions of Negation § 10
27

(1)
N A is true if A is false or there is a false proposition B, with A = N B, and it is
possible that N A and N B are both true;
(2)
N A is false if A is true or there is a true proposition B, with A = N B, and it is
possible that N A and N B are both false. (Cf. § 43, def. 2)
In distinction from ~ B, according to this definitional stipulation N B does not
have the opposite truth value of B in every interpretation in which B is a false
proposition. Let us assume an interpretation in which B is true or false, without a
proposition C existing with B equivalent to N C. Then the truth table for N B
shows that if B has the value F, it is indeterminate what value N B has.
N B
B
?
T
?
F
Since with the meaning I have given to the bivalence principle, it is strictly uni-
versally valid, this table does not mean that there is a third truth value of N B
besides true and false, called ‘?’. It means rather only that the value assigned to N
B, if B has the value F, is indeed, according to the bivalence principle, T or F, but
it is not fixed by the value of B alone which value N B has. To be sure, the state-
ment that N B is true, just like the statement that ~ B is true, entails the statement
that B is false. But it is not at all the case that the statement that B is false would
also preclude that N B is also false. N B and B could also both be true. Let ‘B’ ab-
breviate the proposition ‘N A’. Then, if A and N A are both false, A and N A should
both be negated, so that, according to the bivalence principle, B and N B are mu-
tually compatible and both true. Considered in this way, both lower rows of the
columns for N B and B in the truth table above are integrated into the four lower
rows of the columns for A (= N B) and B in the following table:
. . .
NNN A
NN A
N A
A

. . .
. . .

Incidentally, this table (which could be continued to the left) displays how the
truth value of N A, with A = N B, develops according to its definition. The case in
28
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

which A and B both have the value T occurs precisely when there is a proposition C,
with B = N C, and both C and N C are false. What this table does not capture is the
fact that the value T for B in the first row and value F for A in the lowest row are
definitionally compatible with their respective opposite values. Accordingly, a prop-
osition of the form N B can, in precisely determined limit cases, be truth-ambivalent,
i.e., both true and false. That is, the proposition is true in these cases insofar as it
correctly negates a false proposition B, and false insofar as it is itself correctly ne-
gated by NN B. We call such attribution of opposite truth values to one and the
same proposition ‘paraconsistent’ and a logic which in a restricted and regulated
way admits such attribution a ‘paraconsistent logic’.52
We can also indirectly extract the following from the last table: the truth val-
ues of ~ A and N A concur exclusively in cases in which A and N A have opposite
truth values and there is no proposition B of which A is the negation. If A is true,
then both N A and ~ A are false, and NN A and ~ ~ A are both true.53 Yet an assess-
ment in which NN A is true only says that N A is false, but not also that A is true.
For A and N A could both be false. Hence, the true values of A and NN A could be
different, while the true values of A and ~ ~ A are always the same.
Now it is of the greatest logical significance that the negation designated by
‘N . . .’ under a certain assumption turns into a truth-functional negation. Namely,
‘~ A’ is ostensibly interchangeable with (or substitutable for) the expression
‘N A’
if and only if in every interpretation in which A is true or false, the expression
‘either A or N A’
is a true proposition. With ‘either A or N A’ it is supposed that not both A and N A
are false. On this supposition, the meaning of ‘N A’ turns into the meaning of
A paraconsistent logic in the strict sense explicitly annuls, in a restricted and regulated way, the
principle of the incompatibility of opposite truth values, which is tacitly assumed as universally valid
in truth-functional logics. Those logical systems which are at least compatible with the invalidity of
this principle can be called paraconsistent in a broader sense. It should thus be kept in mind that the
invalidity of this principle is compatible with the unrestricted validity both of the bivalence principle
as well as of the principle of excluded middle for contradictory propositions. As will emerge in what
follows, the “elementary” syllogistic (of § 15) can be understood as a paraconsistent logic. The Aristo-
telian syllogistic can also be presented as a paraconsistent system in the broader sense just now dis-
cussed. On the origin of the label ‘paraconsistent logic’ see Appendix 6 below.
When A is true and not equivalent to N B (for arbitrary B), it follows from A, according to the
just established meaning of ‘N A’, that NN A is true.
3 Analysis of Expressions of Negation § 10
29

‘~ A’. We can also carry out this transformation by replacing the expression
‘either A or N A’ with
‘if NN A, then A’.54
That is, ‘~ A’ may be substituted for ‘N A’ if one assumes (in every interpretation in
which A is true or false) that ‘if NN A, then A’ is a true proposition, hence, so that the
principle duplex negatio affirmat (‘double negation affirms’) holds. In the following,
this assumption is called the principle of the affirmative use of double negation.
We must now ask how the negation designated by ‘N . . .’ is related to that
negation which is contained in my list of the logical constants of the syllogistic
(see § 3).
Here our concern is the negation which appears in the syllogistic schemata of
universal and particular negative propositions. This can be quite adequately ren-
dered using the sign ‘N . . .’. In line with the way we have fixed the meaning of
the logical constants as they appear in particular and universal affirmative pro-
positions (thus in the contradictory opposites of the just mentioned negative pro-
positions), the rules for the use of ‘N . . .’ can also be fixed so that the syllogistic
schemata of these propositions are each equivalent to their respective double
non-truth-functional negations:
Thus, the schema of the universal negative proposition ‘every α is not a β’ is
equivalent to ‘no α is a β’. ‘No α is a β’ is the contradictory of ‘some α is a β’. Two
propositions are contradictories of each other when they can be neither both false
nor both true. Hence, as the contradictory of ‘no α is a β’, ‘some α is a β’ is equiva-
lent to the non-truth-functional negation of ‘no α is a β’, and thus equivalent to
‘N [no α is a β]’.
In contrast, ‘no α is a β’ is equivalent to the simple non-truth-functional negation
of ‘some α is a β’, i.e., it is equivalent to
‘N [some α is a β]’.
The schema of the particular affirmative proposition ‘some α is a β’ is accordingly
equivalent to ‘NN [some α is a β]’.
To be sure, this expression (which permits the interpretation that NNN B follows from N B) is not
equivalent to the expression ‘either A or N A’. For the latter also entails the supposition that NN A
follows from A, if A is not equal to N B (for arbitrary B). But this supposition is already valid on logi-
cal grounds (see note 53 above and § 44, rule (I. 1)) and thus does not need to be cited explicitly.
30
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

As for the schema of the particular negative proposition ‘some α is not a β’, it
is equivalent to ‘not every α is a β’ and is the contradictory opposite of ‘every α is
a β’. ‘Every α is a β’ is, as the contradictory opposite of ‘not every α is a β’, equiva-
lent to the elementary negation of ‘not every α is a β’, and ‘not every α is a β’ is
thus equivalent to the elementary negation of ‘every α is a β’, i.e., equivalent to
‘N [every α is a β]’.
The schema of the universal affirmative proposition ‘every α is a β’ is accordingly
equivalent to ‘NN [every α is a β]’.
§ 11 The Strong Logical Square of Assertoric Opposition
In order to present the logical relations between the schemata of universal and par-
ticular propositions in a clear manner, I have followed the tradition in organizing
these schemata in a square in such a way that the positional relations between them
correspond directly to logical relations. In deference to the traditional nomenclature,
I call these relations the relations of the logical square of assertoric opposition.
The following relations are hereby intended:
1.
Propositions are equivalent when they (with the same interpretation of the
concept variables α and β) come from schemata which are assigned to the
same corner of the square.55
NN [every α is a β]
every α is a β
N [some α is a β]
no α is a β
some α is a β
NN [some α is a β]
some α is not a β
N [some α is a β]
Figure 3
All propositional schemata which appear in Figure 3 can of course be replaced by other
equivalent expressions. This is particularly relevant for expressions which are in the plural.
These are expressions like ‘all α are β’, ‘all β are not β’, ‘some [einige, rather than irgendein;
WCW] α are β’ and ‘some α are not β’. For reasons of clarity, I will use the expressions appearing
in Figure 3 as the standard expressions of the syllogistic propositional schemata.
3 Analysis of Expressions of Negation § 11
31

2.
Propositions are contradictories of each other when they (with the same in-
terpretation of the concept variables α and β) come from schemata which are
opposed diagonally to each other.
3.
Propositions are contraries of each other when they (with the same interpre-
tation of the concept variables α and β) come from schemata which are as-
signed to different upper corners of the square.
4.
A proposition that comes from a schema (with any interpretation of the concept
variables α and β) which is assigned to one of the lower corners of the square is
subaltern to a proposition which (with the same interpretation) comes from a
schema that is assigned to the corner of the square standing vertical to it.
5.
Propositions are subcontraries of each other when they (with the same inter-
pretation of the concept variables α and β) come from schemata which are
assigned to different lower corners of the square.
That the first two relations enumerated here obtain stems directly from what was
said already in § 10; the fact that the three remaining relations obtain of course
also stems from what was said, though indirectly. This will emerge from the fol-
lowing considerations.
A contrary relation, as it is mentioned in the third point, obtains between two
propositions if and only if they can both be false, but not both true. A universal
affirmative proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’ is already false if not all objects
that fall under α are a β, but only some. But this is precisely the condition on
which a universal negative proposition of the form ‘no α is a β’ (with the same
interpretation of the concept variables) is false as well.
A proposition is the subaltern of another if and only if the truth of the first
follows from that of the second, but it does not follow from the fact that the first
is true that the second is. Now a universal proposition cannot be true unless the
proposition which is its contrary is false. Precisely for this reason the particular
proposition which is the contradictory of the latter contrary proposition must be
true. Conversely, though, a particular proposition cannot be true unless the uni-
versal proposition which is its contradictory is false. But precisely for this reason
the universal proposition opposed to this contrary does not need to be true. Thus,
the particular proposition stands in a subaltern relationship to the proposition
which is the contrary of its contradictory opposite.
Finally, two propositions are subcontraries if and only if both can be true, but
not both false, or when, in other words, one of the two propositions follows from
the non-truth-functional negation of the other. Now the non-truth-functional nega-
tion of a particular proposition is equivalent to the proposition that is its contradic-
tory, from which follows the particular proposition that is the subaltern of this
32
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

universal proposition. Hence, the particular proposition which is the subaltern of
this universal proposition follows from it immediately.
§ 12 The Weak Logical Square of Assertoric Opposition
With the exception of the contradictory relation, all relations of the logical square
of assertoric opposition remain preserved when we replace the expressions for
the schemata of universal propositions in Figure 3 with expressions for the sche-
mata of singular propositions in the following way:56
We have already seen in § 9 that the schemata of singular propositions which ap-
pear in Figure 4 are schemata of pairwise equivalent or pairwise contrary singu-
lar propositions.57 Hence the upper horizontals in Figure 4 correspond to the
same logical relation as the upper horizontals in Figure 3. The same holds for the
that α is a β
this α is a β
N [that α is a β]
N [this α is a β]
some α is a β
NN [some α is a β]
some α is not a β
N [every α is a β]
Figure 4
On the logical relationship between singular and universal propositions, see Leibniz (1840, IV.
17, § 8). On this, see Kneale & Kneale 1975, 323. – Kant alluded to this logical relationship with the
remark, “that in the use of judgments in syllogisms singular judgments can be treated like uni-
versal ones” (CPR, A 71/B 96). Treating ‘like’ is of course not equating. It therefore rests on a con-
fusion when Russell (1960, 40) claims of traditional logic, among whose representatives Kant is
surely to be counted, “The first serious advance in real logic since the time of the Greeks was
made independently by Peano and Frege – both mathematicians. Traditional logic regarded the
two propositions ‘Socrates is mortal’ and ‘All men are mortal’ as being of the same form; Peano
and Frege, who pointed out the error did so for technical reasons [. . .] but the philosophical im-
portance of the advance which they made is impossible to exaggerate.” Following Leibniz, Kant
seems to have seen the distinction between the universal and singular forms of judgment in that
with the latter the form of the particular judgment coincides with the universal.
Of course, each of these four expressions have other equivalents. Along the lines of non-
singular propositions, I would also like to accept plural expressions like ‘these α are (not) β’ or
‘those α are (not) β’ as syllogistic schemata of singular propositions, assuming that plural expres-
sions are also used for particular propositions. For reasons of clarity, I use the expressions ap-
pearing in Figure 4 as standard expressions.

lower horizontals, since the same schemata are assigned to them in both figures.
Finally, both verticals in Figure 4 correspond to a subaltern relation. For when a
singular affirmative proposition of the form ‘this α is a β’ is true, at least some α
must be a β; just so, it must be that not every α is a β if a singular negative propo-
sition of the form ‘N [this α is a β]’ is true. Only the diagonals in Figure 4 stand for
a different (and indeed weaker) logical relation than the diagonals in Figure 3.
They do not correspond to contradictoriness, but subcontrariety. That is, they
each connect schemata of two propositions which cannot both be false, but both
can be true: from the non-truth-functional negation of one proposition it follows
that the other proposition is true; yet from the truth of one of the two proposi-
tions the non-truth-functional negation of the other does not follow.
The system of logical relations which correspond to the positional relations
in Figure 4 agree so much with the system depicted in Figure 3 that the designa-
tion ‘logical square of assertoric opposition’ could perhaps be used for both sys-
tems. But to avoid confusion, I will call the system illustrated by Figure 3 the strong
logical square of assertoric opposition, while the system illustrated by Figure 4
should be called the weak logical square of assertoric opposition.
As the expressions assigned to the right verticals in Figures 3 and 4 show, all
syllogistic schemata of negative propositions can be understood as expressing not
truth-functional but rather non-truth-functional negation. That is, they show that
‘not A’, whenever A is a syllogistic schema, is equivalent to ‘N A’, not to ‘~ A’.
§ 13 The Logical Square of Modal Opposition
As a result of what we have said, we should certainly not take syllogistic modal
expressions like ‘it is necessary that not A’ and ‘it is possible that not A’ as if they
were equivalent to ‘□~ A’ and to ‘◇~ A’, respectively. It would not even be cor-
rect to say that they are equivalent to ‘□N A’ and to ‘◇N A’. For ‘□. . .’ and ‘◇
. . .’ are used such that they are equivalent to ‘~ ◇~ . . .’ and to ‘~ □~ . . .’, re-
spectively. In contrast, the expressions ‘it is necessary that N A’ and ‘it is possi-
ble that N A’ stand in relations that are precisely analogous to those of the
square of assertoric opposition, and which I would like to call relations of the
logical square of modal opposition:58
These relations correspond to those Aristotle presents in De Interpretatione 13, 22 a 14 ff.

That is, for propositions which conform to the schemata in Figure 5, the fol-
lowing points also hold:
1. If schemata are assigned to the same corner of the square, they are equiva-
lent. 2. If schemata are diagonal to each other, they are contradictories. 3. If sche-
mata are assigned to different corners of the upper horizontals, they are contraries.
4. If schemata are assigned to different corners of the lower horizontals, they are
subcontraries. 5. If schemata are assigned to lower horizontals, they are related as
subalterns to the schemata standing vertically above them.
If we place the sign of non-truth-functional negation before every expression
of the right side in Figure 5 (in order), then we get the following four proposi-
tional schemata:
‘N [it is necessary that N A]’,
‘NN [it is possible that A]’,
‘N [it is possible that N A]’,
‘NN [it is necessary that A]’,
of which the first and last schemata must again be equivalent expressions. Since
moreover ‘NN [it is possible that A]’ is equivalent to ‘it is possible that A’ and ‘NN
[it is necessary that A]’ is equivalent to ‘it is necessary that A]’ (as the left side of
Figure 5 shows), then ‘N [it is necessary that N A]’ is also equivalent to ‘it is possi-
ble that A’ and ‘N [it is possible that N A]’ to ‘it is necessary that A’.
To abbreviate ‘it is necessary that . . .’, when this expression should not be
understood in the sense of ‘□. . .’, but rather in the sense of ‘N [it is possible that
N. . .]’, I use ‘L . . .’. Accordingly, ‘NLN . . .’ is equivalent to ‘N [it is necessary that
N . . .]’ and will be abbreviated by ‘M . . .’ (‘it is possible that . . .’) in what follows.
In this notation, the syllogistic propositional schemata ‘it is necessary that not A’
and ‘it is possible that not A’ are rendered respectively with ‘LN A’ and by ‘MN A’.
In this notation, ‘NLN . . .’ and ‘~ □~ . . .’ are different ways to understand
and abbreviate one and the same expression, namely, ‘it is not necessary that not
. . .’. They are distinguished from each other simply because the word ‘not’ is
it is necessary that A
NN [it is necessary that A]
it is necessary that N A
N [it is possible that A]
it is possible that A
NN [it is possible that A]
it is possible that N A
N [it is necessary that A]

understood differently. The same holds for ‘NMN . . .’ and ‘~ ◇~. . .’; these, too,
are abbreviations of one and the same expression, namely, ‘it is not possible that
not . . .’, only the negation sign is understood differently in them.

§ 14 Syllogistic and Non-Syllogistic Modal Expressions
This notation makes it possible in certain circumstances to replace modal-logical
expressions in which the signs ‘◇. . .’, ‘□. . .’ or ‘~ . . .’ occur with expressions in
which a certain configuration of ‘M . . .’, ‘L . . .’ and ‘N . . .’ appear instead. Thus
‘◇A’ and ‘□A’ are in turn equivalent to
‘M A’ and
‘L A’,
assuming that the principle of the affirmative use of double negation holds for
non-truth-functional negation, thus assuming that A follows from NN A. This
equivalence in meaning can be easily made clear if one only considers that ‘~ A’,
under the just mentioned assumption, may be translated into ‘N A’ and that ‘◇~
A’ and ‘□~ A’ are equivalent to ‘~ [it is necessary that A]’ and ‘~ [it is possible that
A]’, respectively. When A follows from NN A, the just named expressions may be
replaced with ‘N [it is necessary that A]’ and ‘N [it is possible that A]’, respectively,
i.e., with expressions which according to § 13 are equivalent to ‘MN A’ and ‘LN A’.
These are thus expressions into which we may under the stated assumption con-
vert ‘◇~ A’ and ‘□~ A’; and we may under this assumption with equal right con-
vert ‘NMN A’ and ‘NLN A’ into ‘~ ◇~ A’ and ‘~ □~ A’ respectively as well, and
consequently ‘L A’ and ‘M A’ into ‘□A’ and ‘◇A’ respectively.
Even the expression for strict implication, ‘A ⥽B’ can in certain circumstan-
ces be replaced by a configuration of signs in which, besides ‘. . . & . . .’, only con-
stants of the syllogistic occur. Since ‘A ⥽B’ only abbreviates ‘~ ◇(A & ~ B)’, ‘A ⥽B’
is equivalent to
‘NM (A & N B)’,
36
Part I Section One The Language of the Syllogistic

on the assumption that A follows from NN A for every interpretation of A. Namely,
on this assumption non-truth-functional negation behaves like truth-functional
negation.59
The assumption that A follows from NN A is the assumption that a hypotheti-
cal proposition of the form ‘if NN A, then A’ is true. Hence, the supposition dis-
cussed in § 7 that ‘if . . ., then . . .’ expresses exactly the same thing as ‘. . . ⥽. . .’
needs to be corrected. If both these expressions were really equivalent, then ex-
plaining strict implication by means of an expression in which ‘if . . ., then . . .’
occurs would be out of the question. This occurrence points to a circulus vitiosus.
This circle is inevitable if one wants to interpret the hypothetical proposition ‘if
A, then B’ as an expression which implicitly makes use of the signs ‘◇. . .’ and
‘~ . . .’. There are, to be sure, still good reasons to hold with Lewis that ‘if A, then
B’ is equivalent to
‘it is impossible that A and not B’.
But apparently this expression, insofar as it is supposed to represent the same
thought as ‘if A, then B’, calls for a reading that is inevitably lacking in Lewis’
formula ‘~ ◇(A & ~ B)’. We find a better match for this reading by replacing the
signs ‘◇. . .’ and ‘~ . . .’ in this formula with logical constants of the syllogistic,
namely with ‘M . . .’ and ‘N . . .’ respectively, though without assuming that a hy-
pothetical proposition of the form ‘if NN A, then A’ is true.
But which logical vocabulary is best suited to represent the meaning of ‘if . . .,
then . . .’? This is a question which I cannot answer before answering the ques-
tion whether dyadic truth functions – among which belongs the logical constant
‘. . . & . . ..’ – are elements of a language into which one can adequately translate
the language of the syllogistic. (I will return to this question only in § 30.)
However, it has now already become clear that neither ‘◇. . .’, ‘□. . .’, nor
‘~ . . .’ belong among these elements. Moreover, it has already become apparent
that there are elements of the language of the syllogistic – namely ‘M . . .’, ‘L . . .’,
and ‘N . . .’ – which cannot without more ado be replaced by logical vocabulary of
another language without loss, and in any case not by the logical vocabulary of a
truth-functional language.
A simple way of abbreviating ~ ◇(A & ~ B) from NM (A & N B) will result from the relations
between the forms of the hypothetical proposition and strict implication and will be considered
below in the last paragraph of § 30. Further details are also in Appendix 5.

§ 15 Other Expressions in the Language of Elementary Syllogistic
Concerning the remaining elements of the syllogistic language, it will prove useful
in what follows to introduce abbreviating expressions for them as well. I will use
the following notation:
I use the relational constants with empty places ‘A ( )’, ‘E ( )’, ‘I ( ), and ‘O ( )’
for the four forms of (in order) the universal affirmative, universal negative, par-
ticular affirmative, and particular negative statement.60 I use these letters in def-
erence to a traditional terminology (see § 4 above), which here is reshaped into a
functional notation to enable combination with other functional expressions
(which will prove to be useful in what follows). The empty places of these expres-
sions are always to be filled with an ordered pair of concept expressions which
can be represented by variables (‘α’, ‘β’, etc.). The sequence of concept expres-
sions within the empty places is always ordered so that the expression of the
predicate concept precedes the expression of the subject concept. Accordingly,
‘A (α, β)’ should be read as an abbreviation of ‘α is a predicate of every β’ (or for
‘α is said of every β’); ‘E (α, β)’ stands for ‘α is not a predicate of a β’ (‘α is said of
no β’); ‘I (α, β)’ and ‘O (α, β)’ mean in turn ‘α is a predicate of some β’ (‘α is said
of some β’) and ‘α is not a predicate of every β’ (‘α is not said of some β’). Order-
ing the sequence of concept expressions in this way has the advantage of dis-
playing the transitivity of the subordination relation in conceptual hierarchies.
To designate the forms of singular affirmative and singular negative state-
ments, I propose the relational constants ‘Ạ( )’ and ‘Ẹ( )’ respectively. The corre-
spondence of the pointed capital letters with the constants for forms of universal
statements is meant to suggest the logical affinity described in § 12 above: that Ạ
(α, β) and Ẹ(α, β) have a similar place in the logical square of assertoric opposi-
tion as A (α, β) and E (α, β).
Concerning the representation of Ạ(α, β) and Ẹ(α, β) in normal language
(read: ‘α is a predicate of that β’ or ‘α is said of that β’ and ‘α is not a predicate of
These forms are sometimes equated with the forms of the categorical judgment. See, e.g.,
Mautner 1996, 66–67: “In aristotelian logic, a categorical proposition is a proposition of one of
these four forms: All S is P / Some S is P / No S is P / Some S is not P. / Thus defined, every categori-
cal proposition is either universal affirmative, or universal negative, or particular affirmative, or
particular negative.” Since Aristotle himself did not yet use ‘categorical’ as the designation of a
judgment, it seems that “aristotelian logic” must here mean the logical tradition following Aristo-
tle. – The equation of categorical statements with the four above-mentioned forms is neverthe-
less systematically misleading for two reasons. First, from a traditional perspective, of course,
these forms also include non-categorical statements, namely the sub-statements of hypothetical
and disjunctive judgments. Second, in the traditional conception there are besides the four men-
tioned forms also singular categorical statements.

that β’ or ‘α is not said of that β’, respectively), one may for convenience replace
the use of the phrase ‘that . . .’✶with the less cumbersome use of the demonstra-
tive pronoun ‘this . . .’. Yet it should be made clear that the use of the demonstra-
tive pronoun has the disadvantage of allowing two possible misunderstandings to
arise which concern the formal semantics of the syllogistic vocabulary.
The first misunderstanding would be to suppose that it belongs to the form of
singular statements to be able to treat only such objects which one can show; for
demonstrative pronouns are often used in connection with pointing gestures. How-
ever, a meaningful statement can also be singular in its syllogistic form if it deals
with an object which is neither showable nor perceptible but is rather an abstract
ens rationis which may not even exist. This is the kind of object at issue in a singu-
lar statement like ‘this number does not exist’ – a statement which is true, for ex-
ample, when it is about the greatest natural number. It corresponds to a statement
of the form Ẹ(α, β), with ‘number’ in the place of β and ‘exist’ in the place of α.
The second misunderstanding would be to suppose that singular propositions
of the form Ạ(. . ., β) and Ẹ(. . ., β) have, as demonstratives, a changeable object-
reference with repeated occurrence in the same context (‘this flower is blue; this
is red. . .’). But the expression ‘that β . . .’, as it is used in these propositions must
be understood so that it always refers to the same object with repeated occur-
rence in the same context. It is used both anaphorically as well as kataphorically;
i.e., it points back to places within an already given context when the same β is
discussed in propositions of the form I (. . ., β), Ạ(. . ., β), or Ẹ(. . ., β), or it points
forward to such a place within an (at least potentially) subsequent context. To
that extent, the use of the expression ‘that β . . .’ resembles the use of a proper
name.61 For example, ‘Socrates’ in a proposition like ‘Socrates is mortal’ refers to
some bearer of this name, namely, to precisely the bearer this proposition is dis-
cussing. Which bearer this is can of course depends on the context of this proposi-
tion – if there is such a context. Since the possibility of referring to a certain
individual is presupposed by the use of a proper name, but the determinacy of
the reference depends on the occurrence of the name in several places of a com-
mon context, the use of a proper name also has an anaphoric-kataphoric charac-
ter.62 This is seen in the fact that, if the same proper name occurs in different
✶TN: the more “cumbersome” expression used in the original where I use “that . . .” is “das in
Rede stehende . . .”.
I will give more a precise account of the reason for this similarity in § 33.
The view proposed here and in what follows about the use of proper names is close in some
ways to conception developed by Fred Sommers (following W.V.O. Quine), according to which
proper names and individual identifiers are anaphoric expressions which relate back to state-
ments of the form ‘some S is a P’. See Sommers 1982, 5.

39

places of a common context, e.g., in an inference chain, it refers to the same indi-
vidual in all these places unless several bearers of this name are explicitly distin-
guished from each other in this context. In just the same way, which object the
expression ‘that β . . .’ refers to in propositions of the form Ạ(. . ., β) or Ẹ(. . ., β)
depends on how the β in question is determined in other places in the context, to
which the expression points anaphorically or kataphorically.
In place of the three negative expressions ‘E ( )’, ‘O ( )’, and ‘Ẹ( )’ one may
write ‘N I ( )’, ‘N A ( )’, and ‘N Ạ( )’ respectively; that is, the relations of the logical
square of assertoric opposition admit a more parsimonious collection of basic
signs.
So that we have a symbolic expression for the form of a limitative judgment,
I replace ‘not-α’, ‘not-β’, etc. with ‘N α’, N β’, etc.
Finally, the two-place relational constant ‘H ( )’ serves to abbreviate the hypo-
thetical propositional connection ‘if . . ., then . . . .’. Corresponding abbreviations
for n-membered disjunctive propositional connections, i.e., for ‘either . . ., or . . . .’,
‘either . . ., or . . . ., or . . . .’, etc., are made possible by the use of the n-place rela-
tional constant ‘D ( )’, with n ≧2. The formula ‘H (A, B)’ is accordingly a proposi-
tional schema which is equivalent to ‘if A, then B’, while ‘D (A, B)’ and ‘D (A, B, C)’
stand for ‘either A, or B’ and for ‘either A, or B, or C’ respectively.63
I use non-italicized Latin uppercase letters A, B, C, etc. here and in what fol-
lows as meta-variables. They represent a formula for which there is an interpreta-
tion as a true or false proposition. They can stand in just as much for categorical
as well as hypothetical or disjunctive propositional schemata.
From now on I will call a formal language in which only concept variables
occur as object variables and in which there are no constants other than the logi-
cal constants of the syllogistic previously enumerated the elementary syllogistic
language. A language which is distinguished from the elementary syllogistic lan-
guage only by replacing at least one concept variable with a special interpretation
of this variable, I will call an extended language of the syllogistic. A logical system
which makes do with the use of the elementary syllogistic language and in which
the rules of the logical squares of §§ 11–13 are valid unrestrictedly, I will call the
elementary syllogistic.
Since ‘D (A, B)’ is equivalent to ‘H (A, N B)’ and H (N A, B)’, the possibility – see § 6 above – of
replacing ‘D ( )’ with a truth-functional expression without loss of meaning depends on the possi-
bility of translating ‘H ( )’ into a truth-functional language. In any case, so long as we have not
decided whether this possibility obtains, it is convenient to have a special notation to designate
the syllogistic ‘either . . ., or . . .’.

§ 16 The Vocabulary of the Calculus of Classes
The standard work Principles of Mathematical Logic by David Hilbert and Wil-
helm Ackermann contains in its second chapter, “The Calculus of Classes,” a par-
agraph with the heading “Systematic Derivation of the Traditional Aristotelian
Inferences” (Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 57–63 [1950, 48–54]). It is supposed to be
shown here that all universally valid rules of the categorical syllogistic, so far as
they apply to non-singular statements, can be reduced to non-syllogistic rules of
inference belonging to the calculus of classes. This program, which in its outlines
is committed to the model provided by Ernst Schröder in his three volume Lec-
tures on the Algebra of Logic [Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik] of 1890–95
for the interpretation of syllogistic rules, is guided by the conviction that “the
calculus of classes” makes possible “a more systematic treatment of logical ques-
tions than traditional logic” (Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 65 [1950, 55, modified]) –
whereby ‘traditional logic’ is here a name which has become standard for a de-
ductive logic that uses the language of the categorical syllogistic. Carrying out
Schröder’s program assumes that the vocabulary of this language, so far as it
applies to non-singular statements, can be replaced successfully and without
loss by the vocabulary of the calculus of classes. I will now lay out what vocabu-
lary that is supposed to be.
Yet before I do, I would like briefly to discuss the label ‘calculus of classes’.
Hilbert and Ackermann (1967, 42 [1950, 44]) use this term to designate a sub-
sphere of mathematical logic which, along with set theory – of which it forms
only “a relatively small excerpt” (Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 153 [1950, 139]) – was
developed out of Boolean algebra. The calculus of classes, like set theory, occupies
itself with the investigation of set-theoretical operations, but limits itself to such
operations in which only relations between classes are taken into consideration;
relations between classes and elements of classes are thus disregarded. In other
words, the calculus of classes is occupied with the relations of the inclusion, inter-
section, union, identity, and complementarity of classes, yet not with the relation
of elementhood, which is the fundamental relation of set theory. Otherwise, clas-
ses are the same for the calculus of classes as sets are for set theory. That is,
“class is just another expression for set” (Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 153 [1950,
13]), and furthermore both expressions are widely held to be equivalent to what
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-002

is called the scope (or extension) of a concept in the older logic literature.64 A dis-
tinction between sets and classes, as it is sometimes made within presentations of
set theory, is disregarded at least within the calculus of classes.65
Now, regarding the systematic derivation of syllogistic rules from relations of
the calculus of classes, as well the translation of syllogistic expressions into the lan-
guage of classes which is foundational for this derivation, Hilbert and Ackermann
follow Ernst Schröder in his view that we can read A, E, I, and O propositions as
dealing with class inclusions. This reading is suggested by the fact that the syllogis-
tic schema ‘A (α, β)’ can be reasonably translated by the propositional schema ‘the
scope of the concept β is contained in the scope of the concept α’. If we replace
here the expressions ‘the scope of the concept α’ and ‘the scope of the concept β’
with class variables, i.e., with the Latin lower-case letters ‘a’ and ‘b’ respectively,
and further symbolize the relational expression ‘. . . is contained in . . .’ with the
inclusion sign ‘. . . ⊂. . .’, we get the expression ‘b ⊂a’. This may be translated ‘the
class b is contained in the class a’ (or ‘b is a subclass of a’). This schema is appar-
ently equivalent to the propositional schema ‘A (α, β)’.
Following Schröder, Hilbert and Ackermann suppose that not only the schema
of A, but also those of E, I, and O propositions can be reasonably replaced by expres-
sions dealing with class inclusions. Just as one replaces ‘A (α, β)’ with ‘b ⊂a’, one
can apparently with equal right replace ‘O (α, β)’ with the truth-functional negation
of ‘b ⊂a’, thus with the expression ‘~ (b ⊂a)’, which means something like ‘b is not
a subclass of a’. For, in the same way that ‘O (α, β)’ is the contradictory of ‘A (α, β)’,
so every formula ~ A is the contradictory of A. Concerning ‘E (α, β)’, this proposi-
tional schema means something like ‘every β is not an α’. A proposition whose form
corresponds to this schema is true when the scope of the concept β is contained in
the scope of the antonym of α: if a is the scope of the concept α, then the scope of
the concept not-α is the complementary class of a. If one designates this with ‘a’,
then one may represent the propositional schema ‘the scope of the concept β is con-
tained in the scope of the concept not-α’ with ‘b ⊂a’. Finally, since ‘I (α, β)’ is the
This holds in any case so long as we understand by scope of a concept the objects that fall
under this concept, and not also, as in the logic of Port-Royal (e.g.), the concepts which are subordi-
nated to this concept.
Thus it is not unusual for the concept of a class to be defined by that of the set, by taking a class
as the scope of a condition S (x) of a subset {x ∈A: S (x)}; see Halmos 1976, 22. There is also the
opposite procedure of defining the concept of a set by the concept of a class; so that in some presen-
tations of set theory a set is defined as that class which is the element of another class. On this con-
ception of sets, the calculus of classes has to do essentially with classes, while according to the first
mentioned conception this calculus could just as well be called the ‘calculus of sets’.

contradictory of ‘E (α, β)’, and ‘~ (b ⊂a)’ is the contradictory of ‘b ⊂a’, ‘~ (b ⊂a)’
relates to ‘b ⊂a’ as ‘I (α, β)’ to ‘E (α, β)’.
§ 17 The Strong Logical Square of Assertoric Opposition in the Language
of the Calculus of Classes
Summarizing these considerations, Hilbert and Ackermann write:
We provide [. . .] symbolic presentation of the four forms A, E, I, O of a judgment. [. . .] If a is
the class corresponding to α and b to β, then the judgment [‘All β are α’] is presented by ‘b ⊂a’.
We can also express the judgment ‘Some β are α’ as ‘It is not true that all β are not α’. It is
therefore presented symbolically with ‘~ (b ⊂a)’. For ‘No β is α’ we can also say that ‘All β
are not α’ and represent it with ‘b ⊂a’. Finally, for ‘Some β are not α’ we can say ‘It is not
true that all β are α’, which is represented by ‘~ (b ⊂a)’.
And Hilbert and Ackermann add:
From this notation result the traditional doctrines about opposition and inversion which
concern these forms of judgment. Namely, from the four judgments, the last was expressed
as the opposite [Gegenteil] of the first, the second as the opposite of the third. Furthermore,
both middle judgments in β and α (b and a, for us), are symmetric. Namely, the judgments
‘~ (b ⊂a)’ and ‘(b ⊂a) are equivalent to the judgments ‘~ (a ⊂b)’ and ‘a ⊂b’. (Hilbert &
Ackermann 1967, 59 [1950, 49–50])66
When the authors speak of the “traditional doctrines” of “inversion” in this quota-
tion, they mean conversion rules according to which propositions of the form E (α,
β) and of the form I (α, β) may be transformed into logically equivalent propositions
of the form E (β, α) and I (β, α) respectively.67 What Hilbert and Ackermann are re-
ferring to here is the fact that all syllogistic conversion rules remain in force when
one replaces E and I propositions with expressions for class inclusions: the class var-
iables may be interchanged in these expressions just as one can interchange concept
variables in the corresponding syllogistic formulas.
And further: when Hilbert and Ackermann speak of “traditional doctrines of
opposition” they mean everything the syllogistic teaches about the relations of the
In this quotation, I have adapted the symbolic notation Hilbert and Ackermann use to the
conventions I have introduced.
What are meant are rules of conversio simplex, which are dealt with below in § 55 together
with a further inversion rule, conversio per accidens, according to which one may move from A
(α, β) to I (β, α). This rule shortens a procedure in which, on the basis of a further rule that results
from one of the relations of the strong logical square (the subalternation rule), one first moves
from A (α, β) to I (α, β) in order to then to apply conversio simplex to I (α, β).

strong logical square of assertoric opposition. With this they point to the follow-
ing logical situation. According to Figure 6, it is possible to replace the four propo-
sitional schemata in Figure 3 (see § 11 above) with (moving clockwise) ‘b ⊂a’,
‘b ⊂a’, ‘~ (b ⊂a),’ and ‘~ (b ⊂a)’ (except here with ‘a’ standing for the scope of
β and ‘b’ for the scope of α), without affecting anything in the logical relations
which are expressed by the positional relationships in Figure 3.
Now it must nevertheless be assumed here that there is no interpretation for ‘a’ and
‘b’ in which b stands for an empty set or the scope of an empty concept and that
neither of the expressions ‘b ⊂a’ and ‘b ⊂a’ stand for a false proposition. Other-
wise, there would not be a contrary relationship between them; and, consequently,
the contradictory opposites of these propositions, namely, propositions conforming
to the schemata ‘~ (b ⊂a)’ and ‘~ (b ⊂a)’, would be subcontraries nor subalterns of
‘b ⊂a’ and ‘b ⊂a’ respectively. This would mean that the logical relations indicated
in Figure 6 do not correspond to the logical relations expressed in Figure 3.
This assumption agrees, of course, with a supposition the syllogistic also already
implicitly employs. Namely, the syllogistic also assumes in its use of the subaltern
rules that result from the relations of the strong logical square that there is no
interpretation of α and β in which A (α, β) is a true proposition but β occurs as an
empty concept, i.e., has a scope of zero. Hilbert and Ackermann rightly point out
this out when they write regarding Aristotle’s syllogistic, “According to Aristotle, a
statement ‘All β are α’ holds as correct only if there are objects which are β” (Hil-
bert & Ackermann 1967, 62 [1950, 53]). (This is something that needs more discus-
sion and which I will return to in more detail in § 18 and § 19.)
The propositional schemata appearing in Figure 6, then, are only to be re-
garded as adequate translations of the syllogistic schemata of A, E, I, and O proposi-
tions if the logical relations that obtain between them correspond exactly to the
relations of the logical square of assertoric opposition. Assuming that there is no
interpretation of ‘a’ and ‘b’, where ‘b ⊂a’ and ‘b ⊂a’ both express true propositions
that deal with b as a null class, we find an exact correspondence between these
relations. For, under this assumption, though two propositions of the form b ⊂a
and b ⊂a can both be false, they cannot both be true; they are therefore contraries.
The truth-functional negations of both propositions, accordingly, are subcontraries,

since though they are both true if their contradictories are both false, they cannot
both be false, since it is not possible that their contradictories are both true. Finally,
just for this reason they are subalterns to the expressions from Figure 6 standing
above them vertically. For there is no interpretation of ‘a’ and ‘b’ in which one of
these expressions stands for a true proposition unless the expression which is the
contradictory of the (true) proposition’s contrary is true as well.
Now, within the calculus of classes, one admittedly does not typically make use
of the assumption that there is no interpretation for ‘a’ and ‘b’ in which either ‘b ⊂a’
or ‘b ⊂a’ stands for a true proposition and yet b is the scope of an empty concept or
an empty set. Rather, the inclusion relation is usually understood – as it was by Hil-
bert and Ackermann – so that interpretations of ‘b ⊂a’ and ‘b ⊂a’ are permitted in
which these schemata represent propositions which are both true and yet deal with
the null class. I will call this understanding the set-theoretical conception of class-
inclusion. On this conception, it is not only not a necessary condition for the truth of
statements of the form b ⊂a and b ⊂a that b is not the null class; on the contrary,
the opposite condition, that b is the null class, is even sufficient for their truth.
I call this conception set-theoretical because a theorem of set theory underlies
it. This theorem states that the null class is a sub-class of every class (or that the
empty set is a sub-set of every set).68 Expressed symbolically: Ø ⊂a (and Ø ⊂a), for
arbitrary a. If we assume the validity of this theorem, then it holds immediately for
b = Ø that b is a subset both of a as well as of ā (for arbitrary a). Expressed symboli-
cally: b ⊂a and b ⊂a.
Under the assumption of this theorem, it would be entirely inappropriate not to
admit everywhere the interpretation of class variables in which b is the null class.
Hilbert and Ackermann then write, “Our deviation from Aristotle on this point is
justified by, e.g., the consideration for mathematical applications of the logic [of the
calculus of classes], in which taking the Aristotelian conception as a basis would be
inappropriate” (Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 62 [1950, 53]). What is labeled here the
‘Aristotelian conception’ is the view that statements of the form b ⊂a and b ⊂a are
true only if b ≠Ø. The latter view is opposed to the set-theoretical conception and
states that the subject concept of propositions of the form A (α, β) and E (α, β) cannot,
if true, be a concept whose scope is the null class.
Now given the assumption of the set-theoretical theorem that the null class is
contained as a sub-class in every class, we can express that a given sub-class is not
the null class by means of the truth-functional negation of a class-inclusion. For
example, under this assumption the formulas which appear in Figure 6 ‘~ (b ⊂a)’
In Schröder (1890, Vol. I, 238), this theorem is worded: “the nothing” is “the subject to every
predicate.”
1 A Translation Program § 17
45

and ‘~ (b ⊂a)’ each express that b is not the null class. The language of the calculus
of classes is capable, under this assumption, of making explicit those suppositions
which are implicitly contained in expressions for class inclusions according to the
so-called ‘Aristotelian’ conception. If we want to say that b is not the null class, we
thus simply write: ‘~ (b ⊂b)’. Then, if we add this formula to proposition schemata
such as ‘b ⊂a’ or ‘b ⊂a’, we can make explicit what, according to the “tacit Aristo-
telian assumption”, is implicitly stated by a proposition of the form b ⊂a or b ⊂a
(Hilbert & Ackermann 1967, 63 [1950, 53]).69
Thus, to express that the concept β in ‘A (α, β)’ and ‘E (α, β)’ does not have a
scope that coincides with the null class, one can replace ‘b ⊂a’ and ‘b ⊂a’ with pairs
of propositional schemata, namely with ‘~ (b ⊂b)’ and ‘b ⊂a’ and with ‘~ (b ⊂b)’
and ‘b ⊂a’ respectively. The expressions in the following Figure 7 thus render in a
precise way what was actually meant by the expressions in Figure 6.
Of course, the relations of the logical square continue to obtain in Figure 7, just
as in Figure 6, only if one assumes that there is no interpretation of the class vari-
able ‘b’ where b is the scope of an empty concept, in which ‘~ (b ⊂b)’ is thus a
false proposition.

69 Following Ernst Schröder (1890, Vol. II/1, 220), Hilbert and Ackermann (like Bertrand Russell;
see § 56 below) maintain here (1967, 63 [1950, 53]) that it is impossible to correctly present the
syllogistic modes Darapti, Falapton, Bamalip, and Fesapo in the language of syllogistic. They say
that one cannot treat them like standard Aristotelian syllogisms as inferences with two premises;
they require a third premise of the form ~ (a ⊂a) for their correct presentation. This additional
premise is supposed to have the task of making explicit the existential implication which is con-
tained in the remaining premises of each of these inferences on the view of the syllogistic.
46
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

apparently suited to make explicit class-logical assumptions which are implicitly
contained in the syllogistic propositional schemata, but which cannot be expressed
in the elementary language of the syllogistic itself. If it is the case that an A or E
proposition is true only on the condition that the scope of its subject concept is not
zero, then A or E propositions should in truth be understood as complex proposi-
tions; they then admit a logical analysis in which they are equivalent to pairs of (or
to logical conjunctions of) propositional schemata as they occur in Figure 7. On this
analysis, syllogistic conceptual relations are reducible to class-logical relations,
which prove to be the more elementary.
In the elementary language of the syllogistic, by contrast, both A and E proposi-
tions appear to be simple and elementary propositions, which are not further reduc-
ible. There is no vocabulary in this language with which it would be possible to
distinguish concept variables as signs for empty or non-empty concepts. At first
glance, it may seem that this lacuna should be taken as a deficiency in the language.
Yet we must now examine whether it was correct after all to suppose with Hil-
bert and Ackermann (see § 17 above) that not only A but also E propositions should
be understood such that they cannot be true when their subject concept has a null
scope. For whether syllogistic expressions admit the analysis Hilbert and Acker-
mann proposed for them depends on this supposition.
As we have seen, they suppose that the “traditional theories of opposition” are ten-
able only on the condition that relations between A, E, I, or O propositions with non-
empty subject concepts are considered; i.e., they suppose that on this condition do these
relations correspond to the relations of the strong logical square, and only on this con-
dition are the rules of the strong logical square, which depend on these relations, valid.
§ 19 Alternative Theories
The view held by Hilbert and Ackermann, following Ernst Schröder, about the pre-
suppositions of the validity of the rules of the strong logical square corresponds to
a version of the theory of the existential import of categorical statements which
was developed in the logic books of the nineteenth century. In his book Studies
and Exercises in Formal Logic, one of the last significant contributions to the syllo-
gistic, John Neville Keynes gave the theory a comprehensive presentation (cf.
Keynes 1928, 210–48). Keynes discusses various versions of this theory.
In his view, four alternative possibilities serve to interpret categorical propo-
sitions: A, E, I, and O statements, if they occur as categorical statements, can be
interpreted so that they either
2 The Problem of Implicit Existence Assumptions § 19
47

(i)
all imply that their subject concept, the antonym of their subject concept,
their predicate concept and the antonym of their predicate concept are non-
empty concepts, or
(ii)
all imply that their subject concept is a non-empty concept, or
(iii) all imply neither that their subject concept nor their predicate concept is a non-
empty concept, or, finally,
(iv) imply, if they are particular, that their subject concept is a non-empty con-
cept, but if they are universal, do not imply this.70
If, according to one of these four interpretations, the subject concept of a categori-
cal statement must be a non-empty concept to be true, this means that it contains
an implicit existence assumption with respect to the objects it deals with. One can
then say that it has existential import in this respect.
Keynes (1928, 227–31) shows that none of the four alternative interpretations
allow all relations of the strong logical square to be preserved:
Assuming interpretation (i), the relations of contradictoriness and subcontrari-
ety fall away, so that only the relations of subalternation and contrariety remain in
effect. That is, on this assumption, it is already enough for statements of the form A
(α, β), O (α, β), E (α, β), and I (α, β) to be false that α is an empty concept. In that case,
no two of these four statements can ever form a pair of subcontrary or contradictory
statements.
For similar reasons, the same consequences result in the case of interpretation
(ii). But while in the case of interpretation (i) a statement of the form ‘either O (α, β),
or there is no α, or no Nα, or no β, or no Nβ’ is the contradictory of a statement of
the form A (α, β), in the case of (ii), a statement of the form ‘either O (α, β), or there
is no β’ constitutes the contradictory.
Assuming interpretation (iii), the subalternate and subcontrary relations remain
intact, but the relations of contradictoriness and contrariety fall away. On this as-
sumption, ‘A (α, β)’ says merely that there is no β that is not an α, without saying that
a β exists. A statement of the form O (α, β) says on this assumption that some β is not
an α, if there is a β. As a consequence, a statement of the form A (α, β) is not the
contradictory of a statement of the form O (α, β). For if no α exists, it is not the case
that one of the two statements is false. In this case, however, two statements of the
form A (α, β) and E (α, β) are also compatible with each other and hence not contrar-
ies. For, if neither A (α, β) nor E (α, β) implies that there is a β, what is said with both
As Keynes notes, interpretation (i) corresponds to the view maintained by William Stanley
Jevons, (ii) to John Stuart Mill’s view, and (iv) is the interpretation John Venn favored, since it
was best suited within the framework of “symbolic logic.” See Keynes 1928, 220.
48
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

statements taken together is merely that there is neither a β that is an α, nor a β that
is not an α. And both of these taken together means only that there is no β at all.
In the fourth and last case (iv) it is supposed that particular but not universal
categorical statements implicitly say that there is an object which falls under the sub-
ject concept of the statement. Under this supposition, the sub-alternate relationship
dissolves. For here a particular statement is already false if the existential statement
which it implies is false, and yet the universal statement from which the particular
statement follows according to the rule of subalternation can be true in this case,
since it implies no corresponding existence assumption. The relationship of contrari-
ety dissolves under this supposition as well. For the supposition allows that two
statements of the form A (α, β) and E (α, β) are compatible with each other. That is, if
neither of the two statements implies an existence statement, each of them only de-
nies that there are definite objects with the predicate β. And indeed the universal
affirmative statement denies that there are β’s which are not α, while the universal
negative statement denies that there are β’s which are an α. Finally, the relationship
of subcontrariety is dissolved as well if it is supposed that particular statements
imply that their subject concept is satisfied. For it suffices for statements of the form
I (α, β) and O (α, β) to be false if their subject concepts are not satisfied.
Among the four alternatives considered, interpretation (iv) is the only one
in which the contradictory relationship between A (α, β) and O (α, β) or be-
tween E (α, β) and I (α, β) remains intact. Keynes sees this relationship as the
most important among all logical relations of opposition, and this assessment is
the reason he gives preference to interpretation (iv) over the remaining three
interpretations of categorical propositions: from his perspective it is best suited
for what he calls “ordinary formal logic” (Keynes 1928, 220). It corresponds, as
one easily recognizes, exactly to that interpretation in which A, E, I, and O pro-
positions express set-theoretically conceived class inclusions, so that they corre-
spond in turn to propositions of the form b ⊂a, b ⊂a, ~ (b ⊂a) and ~ (b ⊂a).
Now were one to suppose that the four alternatives considered exhausted all
alternatives available for A, E, I, and O propositions, then one would have to con-
clude from the findings presented by Keynes that the relations of the strong logi-
cal square between propositions of the form A (α, β), I (α, β), E (α, β), and O (α, β)
do not obtain in all circumstances, but rather only on the specific condition that
these propositions contain implicit existence assumptions, and this such that the
truth of these assumptions is beyond question. Since these assumptions can be
explicitly made as referring to conceptual scopes, these propositions admit a logi-
cal analysis which corresponds exactly to the translation into the language of the
2 The Problem of Implicit Existence Assumptions § 19

calculus of classes carried out by Hilbert and Ackermann. This is the view that
most modern logicians have followed.71
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes
§ 20 Grounds for a Modification of the Translation Program
However, the enumeration of the four alternatives considered by Keynes is in-
complete. A fifth interpretation of categorical propositions, which Keynes (1928,
219) mentions in a footnote72 but otherwise did not consider further, says that
only affirmative but not negative categorical statements implicitly say that there is
an object which falls under their subject concept. Manley Thompson (1953) has ar-
gued at length that the relations between any A, E, I, and O propositions in the
strong logical square obtain without exception if one takes the fifth alternative as
a basis, thus if one assumes that not the quantity of a categorical statement (as in
the case of interpretation (iv)), but only its quality decides whether an existential
implication is present.73 According to this assumption, the existential import of
statements depends exclusively on their affirmative form. I would like to call this
assumption the principle of qualitative existential import. – If this principle is as-
sumed, we can show that the relations of the strong logical square are strictly
and universally valid as follows:
First, the relation of contradictoriness remains preserved, since a negative
proposition and a proposition it denies can neither be both true nor both false, so
long as the negative proposition states nothing other than that the proposition it
denies is false. But according to the principle of qualitative existential import,
negative categorical propositions are to be understood such that they contain no
other statement than that of the falsity of the statement they deny.
Second, the relation of subalternation remains preserved. For statements which
stand in this relationship are of the same quality and, therefore, according to the
Peter F. Strawson is among the logicians who suppose that the syllogistic quite generally pre-
supposes that concepts are non-empty, or that A, E, I, and O propositions imply that the objects of
which they treat exist. He saw in the syllogistic a kind of ‘logic of normal language’ which is in-
commensurable with mathematical logic and maintained a doctrine which goes by the promising
name of free logic. See Strawson 1952, 165–79; Lambert 1998; and Bencivenga 1998.
According to Keynes’ note, this fifth interpretation is represented by Friedrich Ueberweg.
The assumption formulated by Ueberweg and Thompson corresponds to an old scholastic
principle. Cf. Prior 1967a, 143. Thompson (1953, 61) also pointed out the recognition of this princi-
ple by Kant and Charles S. Peirce.
50
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

principle of qualitative existential import, they are not distinguished from each
other with respect to their existence implications. Hence, universal statements can-
not be true unless the statements which stand in a subalternate relationship to them
are also true.
Third, the relation of contrariety holds as well: two universal statements which
are distinguished from each other only by their quality cannot both be true, since
each of them implies a subalternate statement which is the contradictory of the
other; however, they can both be false if the subject concept is not empty, and they
are both false if not everything that falls under the subject concept also falls under
the predicate concept.
Fourth and finally, the relation of subcontrariety also remains preserved:
two particular statements distinguished from each other only by their quality
can both be true, but not both false. They are both true when they refer to dif-
ferent objects that fall under their subject concept. By contrast, both cannot be
false. For if one of them is false, the statement which is its subaltern must also
be false, so that the particular statement which is its contradictory counterpart
must be true.
Thus, assuming the principle of qualitative existential import, the relations of the
strong logical square between any A, E, I, and O propositions hold without exception.
Incidentally, this principle agrees in part – though only in part – with what Hil-
bert and Ackermann called the “tacit Aristotelian assumption.”74 This principle says
that an (affirmative) statement ‘all β are α’ is only correct when there are objects
which are β. It does not say, however, that this holds for either of the negative state-
ments ‘no β is an α’ and ‘not all β are an α’.
The principle of qualitative existential import really only expresses the fact
that the truth conditions of categorical propositions are different in kind depend-
ing on whether they are affirmative or negative propositions. The truth of an af-
firmative categorical proposition consists in the applying of its predicate to the
objects or object which it treats. By contrast, the truth of a negative categorical
proposition, understood as the non-truth-functional negation of an affirmative cat-
egorical proposition, consists in the fact that this proposition, together with its
double non-truth-functional negation, is false. If A is an affirmative categorical
proposition, then the principle of qualitative existential import says merely that
the truth of A depends on there being objects to which A applies, while by con-
trast the truth of N A does not assume the existence of such objects.
That Aristotle himself did not make use of the “tacit assumption” which is here imputed to
him and that his syllogistic did not rely on it, I have shown in my 1998, 131–70.
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 20
51

Of course, ‘existence’ must be understood here in a very broad sense of the
word, namely, such that existence coincides with belonging to the (non-empty) do-
main of individuals (“universe of discourse”: Boole 1854, 166) to which the affirma-
tive categorical proposition implicitly relates. A proposition like ‘All Olympian
gods are mentioned in the Iliad’ can be true, even if Olympian gods do not belong
to the domain of objects treated by the modern sciences or monotheistic religion,
for example. It merely belongs to the necessary truth conditions of such a proposi-
tion that the objects it deals with occur among the objects mentioned in Homer’s
works. Likewise, a proposition like ‘A regular ten-sided polyhedron is an empty
chimera’ does not assume that such figures occur, e.g., in physical space or among
the objects of stereometry. For such a proposition to be true merely requires that
its objects exist in that world to which it refers, namely in the world of chimeras.
Now, compare the following propositions with both propositions just men-
tioned: (1) ‘All Olympian gods are gods’ and (2) ‘A regular ten-sided polyhedron has
ten sides’. Whether they are true or false depends in each case on how they are to
be understood. If what they say is that the predicate of being a god is attributed to
all Olympian gods, or that the predicate of being ten-sided is attributed to a regular
ten-sided polyhedron, then both propositions can be true, and this due to the fact
that their objects belong to (non-empty) domains to which the propositions refer.
These domains can in both cases be characterized as the world of attributions. –
Yet both propositions could also be false.75 If proposition (1) is supposed to say that
Olympian gods are gods, then this proposition is false if the world of gods to which
it refers is an empty domain or contains no Olympian gods. And if proposition (2)
is supposed to say that a regular ten-sided polyhedron has the property of being
ten-sided, then this proposition is false if the domain of objects which have ten
sides is either empty or does not contain a regular polyhedron. However we under-
stand these propositions and whatever domain of individuals they refer to – their
truth depends, in all circumstances, on whether their respective domain is non-
empty. Quite accordingly, the non-truth-functional negation of either proposition
can be true entirely independently of whether the given domain is empty or not.
It follows directly from the principle of qualitative existential import that affirmative propo-
sitions of the form X (α, α), with X = A, X = I, or X = Ạ, are false if instead of α the expression of an
empty concept appears. If one calls propositions of this form ‘analytic’, then we must suppose
that there are false analytic propositions. Analyticity and analytic truth, then, must be distin-
guished from each other. Analytic propositions which deal with objects that do not exist may
only be taken as true in so far as they are reinterpreted as propositions which refer to the world
of attributions. Analytic judgments are only true in all circumstances if they are understood as
judgments of attribution. I will return to this point in § 21 and § 57.
52
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

Now we can also formulate the principle of qualitative existential import with-
out speaking of existence if we talk about conceptual scopes instead. In this manner
of speaking, the principle says that an affirmative (in distinction to a negative) cate-
gorical statement is true only if its subject is not an empty concept, i.e., not a concept
whose scope is zero.
If we suppose for the time being that the scope of an empty concept (= zero) is
the same as the null class, and decide to present the relations of the strong logical
square according to the principle of qualitative existential import in the language of
the calculus of classes, then it proves necessary to subject Hilbert and Ackermann’s
translation of the schemata ‘A (α, β)’, ‘I (α, β)’, ‘E (α, β)’, and ‘O (α, β)’ to a modification.
Since, according to the principle of qualitative existential import as well, a proposi-
tion of the form A (α, β) is true if and only if the scope of the concept β is not empty
(thus not the null class) and is contained in the scope of α, it is equivalent to a propo-
sition of the form b ⊂a & ~ (b ⊂b). But a proposition of the form E (α, β), unlike A
(α, β), does not assume that the scope of β is greater than zero, such that ~ (b ⊂b)
holds. Hence it does not correspond to a proposition of the form b ⊂a & ~ (b ⊂b),
but rather to a proposition of the form b ⊂a. Finally, if we render I (α, β) and O (α,
β) (as the contradictories of E (α, β) and A (α, β), respectively) with truth-functional
negations as in Figure 7 of § 17, we can render the relations of the strong logical
square with the diagram in Figure 8.76
According to the way Figure 8 renders them, these relations remain in effect
for any interpretation of the class variables a and b. Thus, a small modification
of the translation program followed by Hilbert and Ackermann seems to have a
chance of success.

§ 21 The Null Class and Empty Conceptual Scopes
In fact, syllogistic propositional schemata can be translated perfectly into the lan-
guage of the calculus of classes, according to the procedure presented at the end of
§ 20, only if we assume that empty conceptual scopes are simply the same as the null
class. But this assumption is inadmissible. Strictly speaking, it is not at all possible in
the language of the calculus of classes to express that a concept – understood as that
for which a syllogistic concept variable stands – is not empty but rather satisfied.
An expression of the form ~ (b ⊂b), as it was used in Figure 8, states merely that b
is not a subclass of every class, in particular that b is not the subclass of the comple-
mentary class of b. This implies that b is not the null class. But this in no way pre-
cludes that the concept whose scope is designated by ‘b’ is empty nonetheless. This
can be clarified as follows.
As a set-theoretical theorem, the supposition that the null class is a subclass
of every class follows from two set-theoretical axioms, the axiom of choice and
the axiom of extensionality. In addition, it must be assumed that some set exists.
The axiom of choice states: For any set a and for every condition S (x), there
exists a set b, whose elements are exactly the x from a for which S (x) holds. This
axiom tacitly supposes that the condition S (x) may be unsatisfiable. It follows
from this that a proposition may be false which states of every x from a that S (x)
holds. For example, ‘S (x)’ may stand for the condition that x ≠x; and it may be
supposed that x ≠x does not apply to the x from a.
From the axiom of choice, it follows that a set exists which has no elements.
For given the assumption that some set exists (whatever it may be), it follows from
the axiom of choice that there is a set, for example the set {x ∈a : x ≠x}, which
has no elements.
In connection with this, the axiom of extensionality ensures that there is no
more than one set which has no elements. For this axiom states: sets are identical
only if it holds for every object that it either belongs as an element to all or none of
these sets. It follows from the axiom of extensionality that empty sets are identical
with each other, since there is no object that is an element of any of these sets.
Hence they are also identical with the set {x ∈a : x ≠x}, which was already sup-
posed to be empty and which was already shown to exist. It is called the null set or
the null class and is designated by ‘Ø’.
Now from the proposition that the null class exists, it can be derived that it is
the subclass of every class or subset of every set, or symbolically: Ø ⊂a, for arbi-
trary a. In carrying out this derivation, one usually argues something like this (see
Halmos 1976, 19): it cannot be false that the null class is a subclass of every class.
For if Ø ⊂a were false, then an element must be contained in Ø that does not
belong to a. But since there is no element contained in Ø, neither can it contain an
54
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

element that does not belong to a. Of course, this argumentation assumes that
there could only be one reason that a proposition like ‘Every element of the null
class is an element of every class’ (namely, an affirmative proposition of the form
A (α, β)) is false, which is that a counterexample exists by which the proposition
can be refuted. However, according to the principle of qualitative existential im-
port, a quite different reason for the falsity of such a proposition can be given,
namely, that what the proposition treats simply does not exist (so that a counterex-
ample does exist either). According to this principle, the supposition that every ele-
ment of the null class is an element of every class is simply false prima facie,
precisely because elements of the null class do not exist.
However, seen in the light of day, the set-theoretical theorem that the null class is
a subclass of every class is in no way incompatible with the principle of qualitative
existential import. Rather, it even assumes this principle. It only requires for its deriva-
tion the use of an additional logical rule which is dispensable within the syllogistic,
namely, the rule that from a false proposition any arbitrary proposition may be imme-
diately derived (whether or not it is affirmative or negative): ex falso quodlibet.✶
According to the principle of qualitative existential import, the following is al-
ready a false proposition: ‘Some object has the predicate of being an element of the
null class.’ For the predicate of being an element of the null class is clearly incompat-
ible with the implicit existence assumption of affirmative propositions. Thus, accord-
ing to the rule ex falso quodlibet, any arbitrary proposition may be immediately
derived from the supposition that an object is an element of the null class. Accord-
ingly, it is true that if some object is an element of the null class, the predicate of
being an element of an arbitrary class a, whatever may be meant by ‘a’, may be at-
tributed to this object. The set-theoretical theorem expresses precisely this situation:
Ø ⊂a, for arbitrary a.77
We will see at a later point, in § 30, that it is not necessarily appropriate to
regard the rule ex falso quodlibet as a strictly and universally valid logical rule.
Actually, one can already recognize in its wording (‘From the false anything regu-
larly follows’) that it should not be counted among the rules of formal logic (in the
narrow sense of this term); that is, if we want to count among these rules only
those whose validity depends only on the meaning of logical constants that occur
in the expressions to which they are applied. As I said (and as we will see further
✶TN: ‘From the false anything follows’.
Usually, the same situation is portrayed something like this: the statement ‘if some object is
an element of the null class, then it possesses the predicate of being the element of an arbitrary
class’ is true, assuming the if-then-relation in this statement is understood as truth-functional, i.e.,
assuming it is accepted as a sufficient truth-condition for this statement that its antecedent is
false. Cf. J. Schmidt 1966, vol. 1, 61.

below, in Part II of this essay), we do not need to make use of this rule in the
syllogistic. But when this rule is not enlisted, it is not the case that the scopes of
empty concepts (as represented by variables in syllogistic propositional schemata)
coincide with the null class as a subclass of every class. Accordingly, empty con-
ceptual scopes are simply not the same as the null class of axiomatic set theory.
At this point, one could perhaps object that any difference between empty con-
ceptual scopes and the null class had already precluded out by the axiom of exten-
sionality. For it does indeed state that empty sets – and ultimately the scopes (or
extensions) of empty concepts must be counted among them – are identical. But this
objection rests on a misunderstanding. To prevent this misunderstanding from aris-
ing, the axiom of extensionality should be made more precise and formulated as
follows: sets are identical if and only if, for every element of the given non-empty do-
main of individuals, it is an element either of all or none of these sets. In the axiom-
atic system to which the axiom of extensionality is supposed to belong, it does need
to be specified which non-empty domain is given. For the axioms should hold re-
gardless of which domain is given. But this obviously does not mean that the axiom
of extensionality supposes the identity of all sets which are empty with reference to
a certain non-empty domain. The axiom states nothing about how sets relate to
each other insofar as they are empty relative to different domains. Suppose, for ex-
ample, a pink Ferrari occurs only in the imaginary world of a certain crime novel;
thus suppose things of our everyday world are contained in the set of pink Ferraris
just as little as in the set of round squares; then, in relation to the everyday world,
both sets are identical according to the axiom of extensionality. But it does not fol-
low from the axiom that both sets are also identical with respect to the imaginary
world of the crime novel. Otherwise, the commissar appearing in that world would
have no chance from the outset of clearing up his case.
Accordingly, in axiomatic set theory as properly understood, there can be no
talk of an absolute identity of empty sets at all. Consequently, neither can it claim
the absolute but only the relative uniqueness of empty sets.78 The supposition that
empty conceptual scopes should not be identified with the empty set that is the sub-
class of every set is completely compatible with this claim.
Taken as a subclass of every class, an empty set is exactly the same as a set
whose elements are objects to which only contradictory predicates apply. If a and
a are the scopes of the concept α and its antonym Nα, then the null class can be
understood as the scope of a concept under which falls every object to which,
Correspondingly, axiomatized set theory as properly understood does not claim that the com-
plement class of the null class is an absolute universal class, i.e., the class of all objects. The so-
called universal class is always only the class of all objects of a certain, given domain of
individuals.
56
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

with an arbitrary interpretation of ‘α’, both the predicate α and the predicate Nα
apply.79 Considered in this way, the null class is to be understood as the scope of a
certain empty concept. This concept could be called the concept of inconsistently
determined objects.
We can distinguish other empty concepts from this concept without difficulty.
While the concept of inconsistently determined objects is empty simply because
inconsistently determined objects are impossible on logical grounds, other con-
cepts are empty without there being a logical reason for this. Non-existence can
clearly also have contingent reasons, or at least reasons which lie outside of logic.
For example, suppose α stands for the concept expression ‘present king of
France’ and β stands for the concept word ‘bald’. Then, according to the principle
of qualitative existential import, we must suppose, if α has a scope of zero, that
the proposition ‘that α is a β’ is false. And according to the rules of the weak logical
square it is to be supposed that the non-truth-functional negation of this proposi-
tion, namely the proposition ‘that α is not a β’ is likewise false. Both suppositions
taken together are in no way equivalent to the supposition that, in the given inter-
pretation, the α is both β and not β. This would be the case only if from the falsity
of two propositions p and N p, both N p and NN p always followed, and thus both
N p and p. But p may not be inferred from NN p, since, as we have already seen in
§ 10, the principle of the affirmative use of double negation is not valid for non-
truth-functional negation. For this reason, the scope of the concept of the present
king of France can be empty without our having to suppose that there are objects
that fall under it that are determined inconsistently.
To clarify with yet another, perhaps more difficult example, let us also consider
the proposition ‘An Olympian god is a god’. Let us assume that the concept of an
Olympian god is empty. Then, according to the principle of qualitative existential
import, this proposition is false. Nevertheless, according to the rules of the strong
logical square, its negation, namely ‘No Olympian god is a god’, can be true. It may
perhaps seem that this proposition makes use of an empty concept of inconsistently
determined objects, since it speaks of a god which is not a god. But the truth of this
proposition depends merely on the fact that even affirmative propositions which
If one defines the null class as the intersection of a class and its complement class, then it is
trivial to assume that the null class is a subclass of every class. For it is trivial to assume that the
intersection of two arbitrary classes is a subclass of each of these classes, from which it follows
that the intersection of an arbitrary class a and its complement must be a subclass of a. – But the
above definition itself would not be trivial if it were understood as saying the scope of an empty
concept is the same as the intersection of a class and its complement class.

look like so-called analytic truths80 can be false if the objects they deal with do not
exist, as the principle of qualitative existential import allows. The proposition ‘No
Olympian god is a god’ expresses the non-existence of Olympian gods, without im-
plicitly assuming that Olympian gods are objects to which an arbitrary pair of con-
tradictory predicates may be attributed.
Both examples we have considered should suffice to make clear that interpreta-
tions of concept variables in syllogistic propositional schemata are available in which
they stand for expressions for concepts with a null scope, without this scope being
understood as the subclass of every class. Strictly speaking, the scopes of empty con-
cepts should not be equated with what is called the null class in set theory. Hence, an
expression of the form ~ (b ⊂b), as it is used in Figures 7 and 8, actually denies that
b is the null class. However, it does not yet express that b is the scope of a satisfied
concept. For even if b is not the null class, this is still far from ruling out that b is the
scope of an empty concept.
For this reason, it is simply impossible to subject a syllogistic propositional
schema to a logical analysis in which conceptual relations are reduced to class-
logical relations and logical constants are translated into the language of the calculus
of classes.
The tacit Aristotelian assumption that is tied to syllogistic expressions accord-
ing to the principle of qualitative existential import, cannot be adequately repre-
sented in this language at all. Consequently, neither the translation of the syllogistic
expressions carried out by Hilbert and Ackermann nor the modification of this
translation considered above at the end of § 20, is able to make possible a “system-
atic derivation” of the modes of inference of the categorical syllogistic.
The translation program followed by Hilbert and Ackermann has thus failed
definitively.
§ 22 Translation of Class-Logical Propositional Schemata into the Language
of the Syllogistic
It is now relatively easy to convince oneself that it is, quite to the contrary,
completely possible to represent, in a language that contains no logical constants
Already above in note 75 I have pointed out that analyticity and analytic truth should not be
identified without further ado. In the recent philosophical literature, one becomes used to seeing
this equation. It is noteworthy that Kant, from whom the modern distinction of analytic and non-
analytic (synthetic) propositions derives, nowhere made such an identification – even if he is
mostly interpreted as doing just this.
58
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

other than those of the elementary syllogistic, exactly what all the class-logical ex-
pressions mean that Hilbert and Ackermann used to derive the modes of infer-
ence of the categorical syllogistic within the calculus of classes.
To this end, consider in turn the expressions for inclusion relations as they ap-
pear above, for example in Figure 7, starting with the propositional schema ‘b ⊂a’.
According to the set-theoretical conception of the inclusion relation, this expression
is further analyzable as a propositional schema which implicitly entails four more
elementary propositional schemata, namely:
(1) Either b is the null class, or b is not the null class.
(2) If b is the null class, then b is a subclass of a.
(3) If b is the null class, then b is a subclass of a.
(4) If b is not the null class, then b is a subclass of a.
Subschema (1) is equivalent to the statement that the class b is either the null class
or not the null class. Understood in this way, it is a case of applying the principle of
the affirmative use of double negation. That is, the disjunction in (1) precludes a
case in which b is neither the null class nor not the null class. Concerning the sub-
statements (2) and (3), together they express a consequence of the set-theoretical
theorem that the null class is a subclass of every class. On the basis of this theorem,
a sufficient condition for the truth of a statement of the form b ⊂a is that b is the
null class. Finally, concerning the sub-statement (4), it expresses the hypothetical
weakening of a categorical proposition of the form A (α, β). That is, while this later
type of proposition says that the scope of the (non-empty) concept β is contained in
the scope of the concept α, its hypothetical weakening simply says: if something is a
β, then it is an α. (4) is a modification of this weakening and says: if not every object
which belongs to the scope of the concept β is an element of the null class, then
every β (i.e., every object belonging to the scope of the concept β) is an α.
The other propositional schemata as they occur above in Figure 7 can be ana-
lyzed in a similar way as well. Concerning the schema ‘b ⊂a’, just like the schema
‘b ⊂a’ it is reducible to four propositional schemata, corresponding to schemata
(1) to (4), if one exchanges the signs ‘a’ and ‘a’ in all places of their occurrence.
Concerning the truth-functional negation of ‘b ⊂a’, according to the set-theoretical
conception, it expresses two things; first:
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 22
59

(5) The class b is not the null class,
and second:
(6) The class b is not a subclass of a.
The propositional schema ‘~ (b ⊂b)’ can likewise be reduced to schemata (5) and
(6) if one exchanges ‘a’ in (6) with ‘b’.
We can readily render all of proposition schemata (1) to (6) in a formal lan-
guage in which only the logical constants of syllogistic are used. Of course, to this
end one must expand the language of the syllogistic, since one now requires in addi-
tion to concept variables also a conceptual constant which can represent the con-
crete conceptual content that occurs in each of proposition schemata (1) to (6). A
propositional schema such as ‘b is the null class’ is distinguished from a syllogistic
propositional schema not only with respect to the type of variables that appear in it,
but rather also by the occurrence of a specific conceptual content; that is, ‘b is the
null class’ is equivalent to the syllogistic propositional schema ‘every element of b is
an element of the null class’. We may here replace the concept expression ‘element
of b’ with the concept variable ‘β’ if b is interpreted as the scope of the concept β.
By contrast, the concept expression ‘element of the null class’ clearly stands for a
concept with concrete content. We could also represent it with the concept expres-
sion ‘inconsistently determined object’ (see § 21). To abbreviate this or the expres-
sion ‘element of the null class’, I will use the conceptual constant ‘ε0’. Accordingly,
we may abbreviate the propositional schema ‘every element of b is an element of
the null class’ with ‘A (ε0, β)’.
Concerning propositional schema (1), the thought contained in it that the
class b is either the null class or not the null class can be rendered with the pro-
positional schema ‘either every β is an element of the null class, or not every β is
an element of the null class’. We can abbreviate this schema with the syllogistic
formula ‘D (A (ε0, β), N A (ε0, β))’.
Propositional schema (2) comes to ‘If every β is an element of the null class,
then every β is an α’. Written as a syllogistic formula, it is: ‘H (A (ε0, β), A (α, β))’
(where a is interpreted as the scope of α).
Correspondingly, propositional schema (3) means ‘If every β is an element of
the null class, then every β is a Nα’. Written as a syllogistic formula, it is: ‘H (A (ε0, β),
A (Nα, β))’.
(4) should be translated as ‘If not every β is an element of the null class, then
every β is an α’; abbreviated: ‘H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β))’.
(5) comes to ‘Not every β is an element of the null class’; in symbolic notation,
it says: ‘N A (ε0, β)’.
Finally, (6) can be translated by ‘Not every β is a Nα’, which says in symbolic
notation: ‘N A (Nα, β)’.

According to this analysis, the expressions in the left column of the following
Table 1 are reduced to expressions in the right column of this table. (I disregard
the case (as a special case) in which b = a, and hence α = β.)
One can see that this analysis is correct by assuming that ~ A designates the contradic-
tory of A. Accordingly, the expressions of the first and fourth rows of the left column
are contradictories of each other; the same holds for the expressions of the second
and third rows of this column. The expressions appearing in the right column of the
same rows stand in exactly corresponding relationships to each other. Consider first
one of the sub-formulas which stand next to the schema ‘b ⊂a’ in the first of the four
rows on the right, namely, ‘H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β))’. A proposition of this form is false
on the condition that its antecedent is true and its consequent false. Precisely this con-
dition is expressed by both sub-formulas in the fourth row on the right. Conversely,
two propositions of the form N A (ε0, β) and N A (α, β) cannot both be true if a propo-
sition of the form H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β)) is true. Thus, propositions whose formulas
are expressed by the schemata of the first and fourth rows of Table 1 respectively
cannot all be true at once. They can, however, all be false at once. For, assuming a
proposition is false whose form corresponds to one of the two schemata of the fourth
column on the right, one of the propositions whose form corresponds to the schemata
of the first rows cannot be false as well. Three cases are thinkable here:
Table 1

D (A (ε, β), N A (ε, β))

H (A (ε, β), A (Nα, β))

(a)
Two propositions of the forms N A (ε0, β) and N A (α, β) are both false;
(b)
only the first of these propositions is false;
(c)
only the second of these propositions is false.
In case (a), the consequent of a proposition of the form H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β)) is true,
but its antecedent is false. But the hypothetical proposition as a whole must be true.
For, on the basis of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation, whose
validity is expressed by the first sub-formula of the first row on the right, that is by
‘D (A (ε0, β), N A (ε0, β))’, a proposition of the form A (ε0, β) must be true. Now the
null class is a subclass of every class, according to the set-theoretical theorem whose
validity is expressed by the second and third sub-formulas of the first row on the
right. From this it follows that, if a proposition of the form N A (ε0, β) is false, a prop-
osition of the form A (α, β) must be true. Thus, in this case a proposition of the form
H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β)) is true. But every proposition whose form corresponds to one
of the remaining sub-formulas in the first row on the right is true as well – at least
assuming the validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation and
the validity of the principle that the null class is a subclass of every class.
Consider now case (b). It is distinguished from case (a) only in that it supposes
that a proposition of the form N A (α, β) is true. In this case, too, all propositions are
true whose form corresponds respectively to one of the four schemata in the first
row on the right. That a hypothetical proposition of the form H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β))
is true when both of its sub-propositions are false holds if the principle of the affir-
mative use of double negation is valid and the null class is a subclass of every class.
Finally, in case (c) as well, all the propositions are true whose form corresponds
to each of the four schemata in the first row on the right. In this case, it is supposed
that a hypothetical proposition of the form H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β)) consists only of
true sub-propositions. In this case, too, the hypothetical proposition as a whole is
true – assuming that the principle of the affirmative use of double negation is valid
and the null class is a subclass of every class. On this assumption, all propositions
are true whose form corresponds respectively to one of the remaining sub-formulas
of the first row on the right.
In summary, one can thus establish that propositions whose forms are ex-
pressed respectively by the schemata of the first and fourth rows can be neither all
true at once nor all false at once. There is thus a contradictory relationship between
the formulas of the first row on the one hand and the formulas of the fourth row
on the other, both in the right as well as the left column of Table 1. In just the same
way, we can show that there is likewise a contradictory relationship between the
formulas of the second and third rows of the right column.
There are therefore good reasons to suppose that the relations which corre-
spond to the expressions in the left column of Table 1 are appropriately analyzed
62

when they are reduced to syllogistic relations which correspond to the expression
in the right column of this table.
§ 23 Reduction of Class-Logical Modes of Inference to Syllogistic Modes
of Inference
At this point, we return again for a moment to the derivation attempted by Hilbert
and Ackermann. They held that the class calculus makes possible “a more system-
atic treatment of logical questions than traditional logic” (Hilbert & Ackermann
1967, 65 [1950, 55]), by which they meant the syllogistic.
Underlying this view was the conviction that one could reasonably substitute
every premise of a categorical syllogism with one or more premises, each of which
is an expression from the calculus of classes, and that, on the basis of this substitu-
tion, it was to be possible to reduce all syllogistic rules to rules of the calculus of
classes. This conviction has proved to be erroneous. By contrast, it is possible to
properly substitute every premise which consists of an expression for a class inclu-
sion by a series of syllogistic premises. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that a
reduction of the modes of inference of the calculus of classes to the modes of infer-
ence of the categorical syllogistic is possible.
Accordingly, we should expect a more systematic treatment of logical questions
from the framework of the syllogistic than from the framework of the calculus of
classes.
In the attempt to derive class-logical rules from the syllogistic modes of infer-
ence, we have struck upon a path which is exactly the opposite of the one taken by
Hilbert and Ackermann. For example, to derive the rule that from two premises of
the form b ⊂a and c ⊂b a conclusion of the form c ⊂a may be inferred, according
to Table 1 (§ 22) the first premise schema (‘b ⊂a’) should be replaced immediately
by four premise schemata, namely by ‘D (A (ε0, β), N A (ε0, β))’, ‘H (A (ε0, β), A (α, β))’,
H (A (ε0, β), A (Nα, β))’, and ‘H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β))’. Now the inference schema
D (A (ε0, β), N A (ε0, β))
H (A (ε0, β), A (α, β))
H (N A (ε0, β), A (α, β))
A (α, β)
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 23
63

is a special application of the syllogistic rule of the constructive dilemma, whose
general form can be represented with this schema:81
D (A, C)
H (A, B)
H (C, B)
B.
The rule of the constructive dilemma may immediately be applied to three of the
four premise schemata that take the place of ‘b ⊂a’ in Table 1. This means that the
first premise schema ‘b ⊂a’ may be replaced by the schema ‘A (α, β)’. Analogously,
the second premise schema ‘c ⊂b’ may be replaced by ‘A (β, γ)’.
Now according to the modus Barbara an inference of the form
A (α, β)
A (β, γ)
A (α, γ)
is universally valid. From two premises of the form b ⊂a and c ⊂b, therefore, a
proposition of the form A (α, γ) may be derived. For this reason, then, an infer-
ence of the form
b ⊂a
c ⊂b
c ⊂a
must also be valid. For a proposition of the form c ⊂a – as we have already seen
above, in § 16 – is directly derivable from a proposition of the form A (α, γ), so long
as it is assumed that a is the scope of a concept α and c the scope of a concept γ. But
this assumption would already be used in order to convert the two premise sche-
mata ‘b ⊂a’ and ‘c ⊂b’ into syllogistic expressions. Accordingly, the validity of the
rule according to which from b ⊂a and c ⊂b, we may infer c ⊂a, relies on the
For the proof of this rule’s validity, see below in § 49. Note of course that the mode of infer-
ence (II. 24) there called the constructive dilemma only permits the inference to a conclusion of
the form NN B. If it is assumed that the principle of the affirmative use of double negation is
valid, so that D (B, N B) holds, (compare § 10) then from this conclusion we may immediately
infer one of the form B.
64
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

validity of syllogistic modes of inference. It would be easy to show that the validity
of all remaining rules of the calculus of classes, as they deal with inferences whose
premises and conclusions involve only with negated or non-negated class inclusions,
can be reduced to the validity of syllogistic rules in a similar way.
However, the attempt to reduce the modes of inference of the calculus of clas-
ses to the syllogistic modes of inference, which is indicated here only by way of ex-
ample, quickly comes up against natural limits. I would like to point them out in
the following paragraphs.
§ 24 Advantages of a Transformation of the Language of the Calculus
of Classes into the Language of the Calculus of Functions
These limits begin to become apparent as soon as one draws attention to the fact
that the language of the calculus of classes is richer than the language in which Hil-
bert and Ackermann attempted in vain to present syllogistic modes of inference. In-
deed, this language contains still other logical constants than those I have taken into
consideration up to now. There are thus modes of inference that can be fully treated
within this language which cannot be presented in the language of syllogistic, or
at least not without further explanation. While the symbols ‘. . . ⊂. . . .’, ‘ . . . ’, and
‘~ . . .’ correspond to syllogistic expressions, namely the logical constants ‘A (. . ., . . .)’,
‘N . . .’, and ‘N . . .’, such equivalents are lacking for the remaining logical constants of
the calculus of classes: the symbols ‘. . . = . . . .’, ‘. . . ∩. . .’, and ‘. . . ∪. . .’, which are
used as signs for the identity, intersection, and union of classes, respectively.
As to the meaning of ‘. . . = . . .’, it can admittedly be reduced to the meaning
of the inclusion sign. For ‘a = b’ combines the content of ‘a ⊂b’ and ‘b ⊂a’ in one
expression. That is, a = b is equivalent to a ⊂b & b ⊂a, so that two statements of
the form a ⊂b and b ⊂a can be abbreviated by ‘a = b’. An inference of the form
a = b
b = c
a = c
can to that extent be reduced to two inferences of the form
a ⊂b
b ⊂c
and
b ⊂a
c ⊂b
a ⊂c
c ⊂a.
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 24
65

As far as the connectors ‘. . . ∩. . .’ and ‘. . . ∪. . .’ are concerned, they join class
variables together so that the schema of an expression that is itself a class designator
arises. Thus, an expression of the form a ∩a designates the null class and an expres-
sion of the form a ∪a the complement of the null class, i.e., the entirety of individu-
als of the given domain (the ‘universal class’). Stated generally, ‘a ∩b’ is the schema
used to designate a class which consists of all elements which belong to both a and
b; ‘a ∪b’ is the schema to designate a class which consists of all elements which
belong to at least one of the classes a and b.
The signs of intersection and union are distinguished from the signs of inclusion
and identity by the fact that they connect two class variables not to a propositional
schema, but rather to a schema for a designator, i.e., a schema of an expression
which itself stands for a class. Since classes are scopes of concepts, these signs serve
(whether taken by themselves or in combination with each other or in combination
with the complement sign) to designate scopes of specific, namely complex concepts
and at the same time to indicate the logical form of their composition. The forms
indicated by means of ‘. . . ∩. . .’ or ‘. . . ∪. . .’ can be called logical to the extent
that they are relevant for the validity of inferences, as, e.g., in the following:
a = b ∪b
c = d ∪d
a ∩c = d ∪d.
In the elementary language of the syllogistic, there seem to be no logical constants
that can indicate the logical form of the composition of concepts, because concept
variables are the only conceptual expressions which occur in it. In this language,
concept variables represent not only every conceptual content, but they also occupy
the syntactic places of a proposition, where the parts of a complex conceptual ex-
pression could be linked by logical constants. Already for this reason, we can hardly
expect that the language of the syllogistic is rich enough to be able to represent all
logical relations which can be presented in the language of the calculus of classes.
Of course, the position can also be taken that the logical form of the composi-
tion of concepts, as it is indicated by ‘. . . ∩. . .’ or ‘. . . ∪. . .’, does not yet find
its most appropriate expression in the language of the calculus of classes either.
Even if it is a question of explaining or defining the relations of the intersection
and union of classes, we can hardly avoid using a vocabulary that brings explic-
itly into play elements of classes in addition to classes and objects or individuals in
addition to conceptual scopes. Thus, the intersection of two classes a and b is to
be seen as the set of objects x, for which it holds that x ∈a and x ∈b. Symbol-
ically expressed:
66
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

a ∩b = {x: x ∈a & x ∈b}.
Similarly, the union of two classes a and b can be conceived as the set of objects x
for which it holds that x ∈a or x ∈b. Symbolically expressed:
a ∪b = {x: x ∈a ∨x ∈b}.
These definitions bring a new type of variable into play, namely individual varia-
bles (‘x’, ‘y’, etc.), in addition to the elementhood designator (‘. . . ∈. . .’) familiar
from set theory, as well as the set designator ‘{x: . . .}’ as an abbreviation for the
expression ‘the set of all x such that: . . .’. Moreover, they also make use of the
truth-functional propositional connectives for logical conjunction (‘. . . & . . .’) and
adjunction (‘. . . ∨. . .’). Neither of these logical constants belongs to the language
of the calculus of classes. Neither do they belong to the traditional vocabulary of
the syllogistic.
As for logical conjunction, I have indicated in § 7 that it was used by C.I. Lewis
so that he could with its help read the hypothetical ‘if . . ., then . . .’ of the syllogistic
as strict implication.
As for adjunction, it is to be clearly distinguished from syllogistic disjunction.
If ‘p’ and ‘q’ stand for two statements which are true or false, then D (p, q) is
true only if exactly one of the two statements p and q is true, indeed such that:
H (p, N q) and H (N p, q) (see above § 6). The adjunction p ∨q states, by contrast,
that at least one of the statements p and q is true and at most one of them is false.
It is, like logical conjunction, a truth function. This can be gathered from the fact
that the second of the two De Morgan’s laws, a ∩b = a ∪b and a ∪b = a ∩b, has a
counterpart in the logical equivalence of A ∨B and ~ (~ A & ~ B). Hence, ‘. . .
∨. . .’ can be taken as an abbreviation of ‘~ (~ . . . & ~ . . .)’.
Now the translation of expressions from the calculus of classes into a lan-
guage that makes use of individual variables and truth-functional propositional
connectives can be both extended and completed if one also translates class-
logical schemata, i.e., expressions containing an inclusion sign, into this language.
This can be easily accomplished simply by saying that ‘a ⊂b’ is equivalent to
‘(∀x) (x ∈a ⊃x ∈b)’.
In this expression, too, a truth-functional propositional connective appears, namely
the sign for subjunction (‘. . . ⊃. . .’). It works for the abbreviation because ‘A ⊃B’ is
equivalent to ‘~ (A & ~ B)’. The connective used as a prefix, ‘(∀x) . . .’, is the universal
quantifier and serves to abbreviate the expression ‘for every x such that: . . .’.
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 24
67

We can translate arbitrarily complex expressions of the calculus of classes into a
language containing individual variables, truth-functional propositional connectives,
and quantifiers. For example, we can render ‘~ (a ∩c ⊂b)’ with the expression
‘(∃x) ~ ((x ∈a & x ∈c) ⊃x ∈b)’,
whereby the prefix ‘(∃x) . . .’ is to be treated as the existential quantifier, which is
simply an abbreviation for ‘~ (∀x) ~ . . .’.
The language in which individual variables, quantifiers, and truth-functional
connectives are used can still be further improved in logical respects. To do so, we
can not only make redundant the use of logical constants of the calculus of classes
(except for the sign for truth-functional negation), but also the use of class variables,
and thus replace connectives of the type ‘x ∈a’ with other connectives. We can see
the point of such a replacement by considering that the relation of elementhood,
more precisely the relation between an individual x from a domain X and a class of
which x is an element, is also to be taken as a relation between x in X and the set
{T, F}, i.e., the set of truth values. Let a be a certain class, e.g., the set of square
roots of 4. Then ‘x ∈a’ stands for the propositional schema ‘x is a square root of 4’,
in which ‘x’ is a placeholder for an expression which is suited to designate an indi-
vidual from the given domain of individuals X, e.g., an element of the domain of
natural numbers. For x = 2 and for x = – 2, ‘x is a square root of 4’ has the truth
value T; but for all other individuals of the given domain, the value F. Therefore, the
expression ‘x is a square root of 4’ for every x in X takes one of the two truth values.
The supposition that there is an interpretation of ‘x’ in which ‘x is a square root of 4’
is a true or false proposition hence assumes that there is a relation F of X to Y such
that there is for every x in X exactly one y in Y, with Y = {T, F} and with (x, y) ∈F.
A function f : X →Y (in words, a function f from X to Y) is defined as a relation f
of X to Y such that there is for every x in X exactly one y in Y with (x, y) ∈f. If Y =
{T, F}, then the function of X to Y is called a propositional function, and we write ‘F:
X →T’ and ‘(x, y) ∈F’ instead of ‘f : X →Y’ and ‘(x, y) ∈f ’. A propositional function
F : X →Y is accordingly defined by the fact that its domain of values contains only
the two truth values as elements. Instead of ‘(x, y) ∈F’, one can also write ‘F (x) = y’.
The first formula expresses that F is the set of the ordered pairs consisting of x and y.
The second formula says that F, in the argument place x, takes the value y. Both for-
mulas express that y is the value the function F takes depending on which individual
of the given domain x is.
Since the interpretation by which the expression ‘x is a square root of 4’ is trans-
formed into a true proposition corresponds to an operation on the basis of which the
right side ‘= y’ of the above equation ‘F (x) = y’ may be replaced by ‘= T’, it is legiti-
mate to regard ‘x is a square root of 4’ as equivalent to the functional expression
68
Part I Section Two The Language of the Calculus of Classes

‘F (x)’ and thus to use the latter as an abbreviation of the former. If one puts another
class designator than the set of the square roots of four in place of ‘a’ in ‘x ∈a’,
then ‘x ∈a’ accordingly turns into an expression that can be represented with func-
tional expression ‘G (x)’. Since there are arbitrary many possibilities to substitute for
‘a’, one needs correspondingly many functional expressions which can stand for ‘x
∈a’. To this end, I will avail myself of an index-notation and write F1 (x) instead of
F (x), ‘F2 (x)’ instead of G (x), and so on. Nevertheless, I will for the sake of simplicity
continue to use expressions ‘F (x)’, ‘G (x)’, etc. as well, so that they correspond not to
class variables but rather class constants. If a functional expression is supposed to
correspond to a class variable, then I will write ‘Fi (x)’, ‘Fj (x)’, etc., and add ‘with
i ≧1’ or ‘with i ≠j, j ≧1’, etc., respectively; or I will replace ‘Fi (x), with i ≧1’
with ‘Φ (x)’, and ‘Fj (x), with i ≠j, j ≧1’ with ‘Ψ (x)’, etc.
The advantage of replacing expressions of the type ‘x ∈a’ with functional
expressions of the type ‘Φ (x)’ stems from the fact that functional expressions can
have more than one argument place. By replacing ‘4’ in ‘x is a square root of 4’
with an individual variable, we get the expression ‘x is a square root of y’. Corre-
sponding to this expression is a functional expression of the form F (x, y). For
when there is an operation by which an expression is transformed into a true or
false proposition, there is a function F from X to {T, F} such that for every ordered
pair (x, y) in X there is exactly one element z in {T, F} with F (x, y) = z.
(Propositional) functions with more than one argument are called polyadic
functions. We similarly distinguish between monadic, dyadic, triadic, etc. proposi-
tional functions. Polyadic functions can only be designated by functional expres-
sions with two, three, or more than three argument places.
The admission of n-place functional expressions with n > 1 provides the logi-
cal advantage of enabling the presentation of modes of inference and types of
consequence whose validity depends on one relation between objects following
from another such relation.
If, e.g., from the proposition ‘There is something of which everything consists’
the proposition ‘For everything there is something of which it consists’ is derived,
then this consequence (whose inversion is not valid without further addition) is to
be seen as an application of a consequence rule that can be represented by means
of a two-place functional expression, namely through the consequence schema
(∃y) (∀x) Φ (x, y)
(∀x) (∃y) Φ (x, y).
This schema merely expresses a rule according to which quantifiers, provided
they appear in a certain order, may exchange their places. That this rule can be
3 Limits of the Language of the Calculus of Classes § 24
69

applied to the proposition ‘There is something of which everything consists’ rests
simply on the fact that the functional expression that can render ‘x consists of y’,
namely ‘F (x, y)’, admits a two-fold quantification. Quite generally, the fact that n-
place functional expressions can be quantified n-fold opens up a space for the
presentation of logical rules of which there is no counterpart in the framework of
the calculus of classes.
Finally, we can enhance still further the logical capability of using func-
tional expressions by admitting individual constants in addition to individual
variables. Individual constants – for which I use italicized lowercase Latin let-
ters from the beginning of the alphabet in what follows – are to be seen as (ab-
breviations for) proper names or as (abbreviations for concrete) designators of
certain individuals of the given domain. By this means, once again, the space
for the formulation of logical rules is expanded in a manner for which there is
no expression in the language of the calculus of classes. The simplest cases are
the rules expressed by the following two schemata:
(∀x) Φ (x)
Φ (a)
Φ (a)
(∃x) Φ (x).
The functional schema ‘Φ (x)’ here can stand both for polyadic propositional
functions like F (b, x) or F (x, b, c) and for complex propositional functions like
F (x) & G (x). Accordingly, in these cases, the functional schema ‘Φ (a)’ would
stand for F (b, a), F (a, b, c), or F (a) & G (a).
I call the formal language one attains when one uses no other expressions than
(1) the truth-functional negation sign,
(2) truth-functional propositional connectives,
(3) individual variables and constants,
(4) quantifiers, and
(5) functional expressions,
the language of the calculus of functions.82 This language is distinguished from the
languages of the syllogistic and the calculus of classes mainly by the fact that its task
Hilbert and Ackermann use the label ‘calculus of functions’ in the first two editions of their
work Principles of Mathematical Logic [Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik]. Ackermann replaced
it in all later editions with the designation ‘predicate calculus’. I prefer ‘calculus of functions’,
and indeed for reasons which should become clear in the following. Still more felicitous appears
to me ‘the logical calculus of functions’, the designation used by Kurt Gödel (1933a, 433–43). By
‘calculus of functions’ here and in the following, I always mean the logical calculus of functions,
i.e., the calculus of classical propositional and predicate logic.

is presenting truth functions and propositional functions. Propositional functions
and truth functions deal with functions of a similar kind. Namely, every truth func-
tion is a function f: X →Y with X = {p1, . . ., pn} and Y = {T, F}. Here {p1, . . ., pn}, with
n ≧1, is the set of statements, i.e., the set of everything that has one of the two truth
values. Propositional and truth functions are thus distinguished from each other
only in that their argument domains are different.

§ 25 The Representation of Concept Expressions with Functional Expressions
The fact that the language of the calculus of functions is, considered logically, far
superior to the language of the calculus of classes gives us reason to ask whether
this superiority also includes the capacity to make the vocabulary of syllogistic at
least partially redundant as the vocabulary of deductive logic. Is it possible to re-
present the conceptual relations with which the syllogistic is concerned with func-
tional expressions? Can the vocabulary that appears within syllogistic propositional
schemata be at least partially replaced by expressions that present propositional
functions and truth functions?
It was Gottlob Frege who maintained that all conceptual relations dealt with in
the syllogistic can be presented in the language of the calculus of functions and
who developed this language as the core component of what he called a concept-
script.
Frege believed that “all relations between concepts” – and by this he meant
relations which can be represented by (non-modal) syllogistic propositional sche-
mata like ‘A (α, β)’, ‘N I (α, β)’, etc. – “can be reduced” to a “fundamental logical
relation,” which he designated as the relation “of an object’s falling under a con-
cept” (Frege 1983, 128 [1979, 118]), by which he meant the relation between an in-
dividual of a given domain and a monadic propositional function. The logical
relation between an individual a and a concept under which it falls is portrayed
by an expression of the type ‘F (a)’, which just means that ‘a is an F’ or ‘a falls
under the concept F’.
We can clarify provisionally what Frege intended with this reduction by
keeping in view how, in § 12 of his 1879 Begriffschrift, he interpreted the logical
square that I presented in § 11 by means of Figure 3. Frege presents this square in
the form of a diagram corresponding to the following arrangement:83
The notation I use here and in what follows differs from the two-dimensional ‘concept-script’
notation used by Frege.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-003

In this diagram, four functional expressions are used which are supposed to
present the syllogistic conceptual relations from the strong logical square of oppo-
sition. The two universally quantified subjunctions, which appear in the upper
corners of the diagram, are thus supposed to present A and E relations, while the
truth-functional negations, which stand opposite them in this diagram, are sup-
posed to stand for O and I relations respectively.
As one can see, in Frege’s diagram longer chains of signs stand in the place of
simple triads of syllogistic letters, which already indicates that Frege takes the con-
ceptual relations occurring in the A, E, I, and O expressions as complex structures,
whose complexity cannot be recognized in the syllogistic expressions. In Frege’s eyes,
what are logically fundamental are apparently not the qualitative and quantitative
moments of the four relevant syllogistic conceptual relations, but rather the relations
which are designated by means of functional expressions of the form Φ (x) and Ψ (x).
These take the place of the syllogistic concept variables. If the individual variable ‘x’
in both functional expressions is replaced by an individual constant, or, as in
Figure 9, bound by a quantifier, then ‘Φ (x)’ and ‘Ψ (x)’ become expressions indi-
cating individuals of a given domain falling under a concept. Understood in this
way, the expression ‘(∀x) (F (x) ⊃G (x))’ states that for every individual of the
given domain, x does not fall under F unless x falls under G. And understood in this
way, the expression ‘(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))’ should correspond exactly, according to
Frege, to the syllogistic schema of a universally affirmative categorical proposition,
namely the propositional schema ‘every α is a β’, – in which the concept variables
‘α’ and ‘β’ correspond to the functional expressions ‘Φ (x)’ and ‘Ψ (x)’ respectively.
I had said in § 1 that in a proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’ a concept α is
subordinated to a concept β. Of propositions which state that an object falls under a
concept, by contrast, I would like to say that in them an object is subsumed under a
concept. Frege rightly attached great significance to carefully distinguishing the sub-
sumption of an object under a concept from the subordination of a concept under
another concept. Since ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’ stands not for a concept but rather an object, in
‘F (a)’ an object is subsumed under a concept, apparently without at the same time
a concept being subordinated to another concept. By contrast, the subordination of
a concept under another concept, as it is expressed for Frege by ‘(∀x) (F (x) ⊃G (x))’,
apparently always presupposes a subsumption of an object under concepts. This

circumstance is, as it seems, what convinced Frege that the subsumption of an object
is a logically more fundamental operation than the subordination of concepts. Thus,
an object’s falling under a concept is a more basic logical relation than the relation
which one concept can have to another.
Since it is always possible to represent the subsumption of an object under a
concept with the connection of a function sign with an argument letter, it may seem
reasonable to regard monadic propositional functions, with Frege, as logically more
basic than conceptual relations which are rendered with syllogistic expressions. In
the formal language of syllogistic there is, as it appears, no special expression for
the subsumption of an object under a concept. This may suggest the conclusion that
the formal language of syllogistic is inferior to the calculus of functions, which is the
richer language: it thus may look as if one could indeed present in the latter all syl-
logistically relevant relations, while conversely it does not seem possible to render
even the logically fundamental relations in the language of the syllogistic.
§ 26 The Function Theory of Concepts
But what exactly do concepts have to do with functions? For the purposes of a
precise comparison of the two languages, we need to notice the specific assump-
tions on which Frege’s equalization of function and concept relies. It is indeed
relatively easy to see that this equalization does not concern concepts in the same
sense in which syllogistic treats concepts and their relations. When Frege says of
the ‘concept F’ that an object a falls under it if F (a), then he apparently does not
use the word ‘concept’ in exactly the same sense in which the concept expressions
represented by ‘α’ and ‘β’ in ‘A (α, β)’ stand for concepts.
Frege himself emphasized that function variables should be clearly distin-
guished from concept variables as they are used in the syllogistic to represent
subject-predicate relations.84 Unlike concept variables, function variables stand
for incomplete (syncategorematic) bearers of meaning, since they must carry
with them at least one empty place. The variable ‘x’ appearing free in ‘Φ (x)’, as a
non-quantified functional expression, always only designates an empty place. Its
task is merely to indicate that the empty place it occupies is to be filled by an
expression that designates an individual variable. Only when the empty place is
Frege 1964a, xiii (1967, 7): “In particular, I believe that the replacement of the concepts subject
and predicate by argument and function, respectively, will stand the test of time. It is easy to see
how regarding a content as a function of an argument leads to the formation of concepts.” –
Here and in what follows I disregard the fact that Frege himself declined to make use of the ex-
pressions ‘function variable’, ‘concept variable’, ‘individual variable’, or ‘quantifier’.
74
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

filled by an argument letter (‘a’, ‘b’, . . .) or by a bound (i.e., not occurring free)
individual variable does a complete bearer of meaning arise.
Thus, although that which a term stands for is not a function for Frege, he ne-
vertheless curiously takes it to be appropriate to regard concepts as functions. In-
deed, Frege is even prepared to develop something like a theory according to which
a concept is nothing else than just such a function with exactly one argument and
whose value is always a truth value.85 Frege’s theory of concepts undertakes a pro-
found revision of the syllogistic concept of concepts. To begin with, we must ask our-
selves whether this revision is truly necessary in order to give a reasonable sense to
Frege’s claim that all conceptual relations (as they occur in the non-modal syllogistic)
could be reduced to what he called the basic logical relation, namely, to the relation
of the type F (a).
According to Frege’s function theory of concepts, concepts are monadic pro-
positional functions.86 This definition requires an explanation, since it can easily
be misunderstood. ‘F (a)’ does not stand for a concept; it is rather a closed propo-
sition – i.e., it contains no empty place. In Frege’s view, a functional expression
represents a concept only insofar as it contains (at least) one empty place, such as
the incomplete expression ‘F ( )’. Frege calls a function represented by a functional
expression with at least one argument place “unsaturated.”87 His function theory of
concepts is thus to be understood as saying that concepts are essentially the same
as unsaturated monadic propositional functions.
In this conception, neither a (non-syncategorematic) expression like ‘square root
of four’ nor a (syncategorematic) expression like ‘square root of x’ is a concept ex-
pression. The first expression is suited rather to play the role of a term; it is thus a
concept expression only in the syllogistic sense of this word. Accordingly, we could
call ‘square root of x’ an open syllogistic concept expression, since it is suited to play
the role of a term so long as the empty place designated by ‘x’ in it is filled in such a
way that it becomes a closed syllogistic expression. By contrast, in Frege’s function
See “[Comments on Sense and Meaning]” in Frege 1983, 129 (1979, 119), and “Funktion und
Begriff” (1891) in Frege 1990, 133 (1960, 30).
Frege does not use the words ‘monadic’ or ‘propositional function’. One should also note that
the designation ‘propositional function’ as I use it is not completely equivalent to what is called a
propositional function following Bertrand Russell. The latter is usually understood as a function
whose value is not T or F, but rather F (a) or F (b), etc.
See the passages linked to the keyword “Funktion, – Ungesättigtheit (Ergänzungsbedürftig-
keit)” [“Function, – unsaturatedness of a –”] in the index to Frege 1983, 318 (1979, 284). Here and
in what follows, I adopt a simplified usage, according to which functions and concepts have
empty places, although of course neither functions nor concepts can contain brackets or the like.
What this usage intends is that functions and concepts are designated by expressions which con-
tain freely occurring variables enclosed by brackets.

theory of concepts, the expression ‘x2 = 4’ stands for a concept, since it corresponds
to a function F (x) that takes the value T (the True) for x = 2 or x = –2 and the value F
(the False) for all other arguments. Represented in words, the concept expression
‘x2 = 4’ is equivalent to the open proposition ‘x is a square root of four’.
Now according to the function theory of concepts ‘x is a square root of x’ is
also an expression of a concept. This expression corresponds to a function F (x, y)
with x = y. Its value is the truth value T for x = 1, and the truth value F for all other
arguments. Though ‘F (x, x)’ is a two-place functional expression, since it refers to a
function with only one argument, it can be translated into an open proposition
with only one empty place, namely ‘. . . is a square root of itself’.
Strictly speaking, according to the function theory of concepts ‘x is a square
root of y’ can also be an expression for a concept, though if and only if ‘x’ and ‘y’
take the same argument. Indeed, taken on their own, individual variables have no
distinct meaning, but designate only empty places; they are as it were placeholders
for expressions that designate individuals. Hence one cannot simply see in a for-
mula like ‘F (x, y)’ whether it is supposed to be an expression for a monadic or a
dyadic function. Neither the number of places nor the shape of individual variables
decides whether a functional expression is suited to represent an unsaturated mo-
nadic propositional function – and thereby a concept.
Incidentally, we cannot even tell from an expression ‘Φ (x)’, as it occurred,
e.g., in Figure 9, whether it is supposed to stand for a one- or many-place functional
expression. ‘Φ (x)’, as an expression for a monadic propositional function, can stand
for either ‘F (x)’ and ‘G (x, y)’, as well as for ‘H (x, y, z)’, etc., so long as the individual
variables other than ‘x’ are used in such a way that they either designate the same
individual as ‘x’, are replaced by an individual constant, or are bound by a quanti-
fier. In all these cases, it is possible to render ‘Φ (x)’ as an open proposition with ex-
actly one empty place, in which this empty place is the place of the grammatical
subject. In this way, e.g., the three-place functional expression (true for x = 2) ‘x is a
square root of the sum of x and x’, is equivalent to the open proposition ‘x is a square
root of the sum of two summands, which are equal to the root of both’. This open
proposition is also a concept in the sense of the function theory of concepts.
In the literature on Frege, the erroneous equation of being a monadic function
and being represented by a one-place functional expression is completely wide-
spread. Hence it is sometimes thought that concept expressions in Frege’s sense
would have to be functional expressions with exactly one empty place, as if a greater
number of empty places could only occur in expressions of polyadic functions.88 But
Frege’s stipulation that concepts are functions with exactly one argument, whose value is al-
ways a truth value, is often interpreted as if concepts could only be portrayed with one-place
76
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

Frege carefully considered the fact that the number of places in a functional expres-
sion need not correspond to the number of arguments of the given function and no-
ticed exactly the distinction between the number of arguments and the number of
empty places. He thus counted an expression like ‘a is not identical to itself’ explicitly
as a monadic propositional function, although it is rendered with ‘~ F (a, a),’ namely,
‘~ (a = a)’ (see Frege 1986/1950, § 74).
Since in Frege’s view a concept is an unsaturated function and can be presented
with an expression with more than one empty place, expressions for what Frege
calls a “relation concept,” or “relation” for short, can be transformed into concept ex-
pressions. Frege uses “relation” or “relation concept” for propositional functions with
more than one argument. For polyadic propositional functions with three or more
than three arguments, Frege speaks of “relations” with three or more than three
“fundaments” (Frege 1983, 270 [1979, 250, modified]). There is in his view an exact
analogy between concepts and relation concepts: in a similar way as a singular object
a falls under a concept F, in his view an ordered n-tuple of objects fall under a rela-
tion concept R, such that R is a relation in which one of the elements of the n-tuple
stands to the remaining elements of this n-tuple.89 A functional expression which rep-
resents a relation or a relation concept is accordingly transformed into a concept ex-
pression when all the available empty places in it are filled by the same individual
signs, or by such individual signs as refer to one and the same argument (e.g., x, y, z
. . . with x = y, y = z . . .).
Concepts are at bottom to be regarded as limit cases of relations. That is, for
every relation (in Frege’s sense) there is always one concept which can be pro-
duced out of it through partial saturation as it were, so that all empty places in its
functional expressions. This is a misunderstanding which even Gottfried Gabriel, the editor of
Frege’s Schriften zur Logik und Sprachphilosophie (1971, 176 n. 13) has followed. We find the same
misunderstanding on the part of the editors of Frege’s scholarly correspondence; see Frege 1976,
202. As proof, they refer to Frege’s Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893, 8 [2013, 8]). But here Frege,
quite consistently, characterizes concepts not as one-place functions, but rather as functions “with
only one argument”. In the Frege literature, the talk of one-place functions as abbreviations for
“functions which correspond to a functional expression with exactly one empty place, that is an
expression of the type ‘F (x)’,” has become normalized; it is often discussed as if one-place and mo-
nadic functions were the same.
Frege 1986/1950, § 70: “The singular pairs of ordered objects are related in a similar way –
one could say as subjects – to the relation-concepts, as is the singular object to the concept under
which it falls. The subject is here something composite. [. . .] Here the particular content of the
relation is not under consideration, but rather only the logical form. [. . .] Just as ‘a falls under
the concept F’ is the general form of a judgeable content which deals with an object a, so can we
take ‘a stands in the relation ϕ to b’ as the general form for a judgeable content which deals with
the object a and the object b.”

expression but one are filled.90 For example, the expression ‘. . . is a square root
of . . .’, which is suited to present a relation, immediately becomes a Fregean con-
cept expression when its second empty place is occupied by the name of an individ-
ual or by a bound variable, while its first argument place remains unoccupied. All
relation expressions can be transformed into concept expressions through this pro-
cedure. By contrast, an (inverse) transformation of concept expressions into relation
expressions is not always possible. For some concept expressions – like, e.g., ‘. . . is a
horse’ – are composed in such a way that no Fregean relation expression would
arise by replacing one of its component expressions with a (second) argument place.
§ 27 Grammatical and Logical Predicates
Propositions which are true or false obviously contain no empty places. Hence, in
cases in which a true or false proposition deals with a relation, it is always possi-
ble to understand the relation expression as a mere component of a concept ex-
pression in the function-theoretical sense of this word. Hence there is a respect in
which concept expressions have a systematic priority to other propositional
parts, not only from the standpoint of syllogistic, but also from the perspective of
the function theory of concepts.
Taken on its own, a function-theoretical concept expression always has the
form of an open proposition whose empty place is the place of the propositional
subject and whose components always form a totality which stands in a predicative
position to the propositional subject. Since in the function theory of concepts a con-
cept expression is suited to play a predicative role in every proposition, Frege as-
cribes to concepts quite generally a “predicative nature.”91 “What in the case of a
function we call unsaturatedness, we may, in the case of a concept, call its predica-
tive nature” (Frege 1983, 129 [1979, 119]).
On this point as well, the function theory of concepts resonates with the syllogis-
tic conception of concepts. For such concepts as can be represented through syllogis-
tic concept expressions also have something like a predicative nature. Concepts for
which a syllogistic term can stand are, namely, (as I have indicated in § 5) either
predicate concepts or at least suited to adopt the role of a predicate concept. The
same concept which appears as the subject concept in the context of one proposition
can be the predicate concept in another proposition. For this reason, Kant could

characterize concepts quite generally by the fact that they “are predicates of possible
judgments” (see CPR A 69/B 94).
Yet from the traditional syllogistic perspective, predicates, provided they are
concept expressions, are logical, not grammatical predicates. In the traditional
syntax, which goes back to the Latin grammarians, a simple proposition consists
of two parts, which are distinguished from each other as ‘subject’ and ‘predi-
cate’.92 As related to parts of propositions, of course, this distinction is not a logi-
cal but merely grammatical distinction, so that the two distinct parts of the
proposition are regarded as the grammatical subject or as the grammatical predi-
cate. Nevertheless, the grammatical subject/predicate distinction is systematically
connected with the logical subject/predicate distinction. For the grammatical sub-
ject stands for the object of the proposition, i.e., that which the proposition is
about and of which the predicate is stated. In propositions like ‘Theaetetus flies’
or ‘Every human flies’, Theaetetus (or more precisely, the sole bearer of the name
‘Theaetetus’ who is being discussed) or every human are the objects to which the
grammatical predicate in these propositions, ‘. . . flies’, is related. From a logical
point of view, the grammatical subjects ‘Theaetetus . . .’ and ‘every human . . .’
are distinguished by the fact that they are components of propositions of distinct
quantity. Namely, ‘Theaetetus flies’ is equivalent to the singular proposition ‘That
bearer of the proper name “Theaetetus” flies’. From a logical point of view, the
grammatical subject ‘Theaetetus’ is equivalent to a complex expression which on
the one hand contains the concept expression ‘bearer of the proper name “Theae-
tetus”’, and on the other hand the logical constant characteristic of singular prop-
ositions, ‘that . . .’, just as the grammatical subject ‘Every human . . .’, apart from
the concept word ‘human’ contains the logical constant characteristic of universal
propositions, ‘every . . .’. In traditional syllogistic logic, the concept expression
that appears in the grammatical subject of a proposition is called the logical sub-
ject of the proposition.93 Just as in this conception the grammatical subject is,
from a logical point of view, composed of the concept expression designated as
logical subject and a logical constant, so too in this conception the grammatical
predicate is to be understood as logically composite. Thus ‘Theaetetus flies’ and
See Martianus Capella, De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii (1983, IV, 361) and Apuleius, Peri her-
meniae (1908, IV, 267). The grammatical doctrine of the bipartite character of simple propositions
goes back ultimately to the thesis, developed in Plato’s Sophist (261 c–263 a), that every simple
proposition consists of noun (ὄνομα) and verb (ῥῆμα).
Unlike the syllogistic tradition, in the literature influenced by Frege, e.g., in Peter F. Strawson
(1959, 12), the object of the proposition (designated by the grammatical subject of the proposi-
tion), namely, what Strawson calls the “object of reference,” is equated with the logical subject of
the proposition.
1 A Translation Program § 27
79

‘Every human flies’ are logically categorical propositions, each of which brings
something under the concept of flying with the grammatical predicate ‘. . . flies’.
Here the object of the proposition is subsumed under the concept of flying with ‘. . .
flies’. But this does not mean that ‘. . . flies’ is itself already a concept expression. As
a verb, this part of the proposition only implicitly contains such an expression,
namely, insofar as it is equivalent to an expression which can be reasonably ana-
lyzed into the auxiliary word ‘is’ and a predicate noun ‘a flying thing’. The nominal
component of the grammatical predicate contains the logical predicate of the propo-
sition, ‘flying thing’, while ‘. . . is a . . .’ belongs among the logical constants of cate-
gorical propositions.94
Since the predicate noun, as the nominal component of the grammatical
predicate, is representable by a concept variable, we can say that the expression
‘. . . is an α’
is, from the syllogistic perspective, the basic form of a grammatical predicate in
logical syntax. Considered in this way, it is essential to grammatical predicates to
contain syllogistic concept expressions, i.e., expressions for logical predicates in
the traditional meaning of this word.95
If one decides to maintain the traditional distinction between grammatical and
logical predicates and grammatical and logical subjects, – and I see no substantial
reason requiring us to abandon this distinction96 – then it turns out that what
Frege called the ‘predicative nature’ of unsaturated monadic propositional func-
tions consists precisely in not being able to be designated by the logical but by the
grammatical predicate of a proposition. While from the syllogistic perspective only
the nominal component of the grammatical predicate ‘. . . is an α’ – thus that for
which ‘α’ stands – is the expression of a concept, it follows from the function theory
I will go into the relationship between grammatical and logical subjects more extensively
below, in §§ 33 and 65. The similarity with the relationship between grammatical and logical
predicates will become clearer there.
And, conversely, it is in the traditional conception characteristic of concept expressions that
they are able to be syntactic components of grammatical predicates. For the syllogistic conversion
rules depend on the fact that terms standing in the subject place of one proposition are suited to
stand in the predicate place of other propositions.
Since Frege it has become usual to distinguish between logical and grammatical predicates in
a way that is almost exactly opposite to the traditional distinction. Occasionally Frege calls
“grammatical predicate” the expression of what is traditionally taken as the logical predicate of a
proposition; cf. Frege 1983, 106 (1979, 96). But the advantage that is gained from this terminologi-
cal revolution seems, quite questionably, limited to depriving the basis for classifying functional
expressions like ‘F ( )’ in ‘F (a)’ and ‘. . . flies’ in ‘Theaetetus flies’ as grammatical predicates.
80

of concepts that the grammatical predicate itself is a concept expression. As a gram-
matical predicate, it has the shape of an open proposition, whose argument place is
the place of the grammatical subject.
It is the specific structure of the grammatical predicate, ‘. . . is an α’, that makes
it possible to represent A, E, I, and O statements with functional expressions. Con-
sider the form A (α, β), which can be reasonably rendered by ‘every β is an α’. Ac-
cording to the function theory of concepts, this form is reducible to the form (∀x)
(Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x)). According to Frege, we can translate this expression with:
‘For every x: if x falls under the concept Φ, then x falls under the concept Ψ’,
or more briefly with:
‘For every x: if x is a Φ, then x is a Ψ’, or more briefly still with:
‘Every Φ is a Ψ’. (Frege 1879/1967, § 12)
The last three translations are distinguished from ‘Every β is an α’ only by the
shape of the variables used. All three translations rely on the assumption that one
can represent the form Φ (x) with ‘x is a Φ’. For ‘x falls under the concept Φ’ is
supposed to say nothing else than that x is a Φ.
What is irritating in all three translations is that they involve a different use of
‘Φ’ and ‘Ψ’ than occurs in the formula to be translated, ‘(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))’. For
both letters are used in the translations as if they were not function signs bearing
empty places, but syllogistic concept variables. Even the talk of a ‘concept F’ under
which an object x falls, and turns of phrase like ‘. . . is an F’, make it seem that ‘F’
is only supposed to stand for a nominal expression, that it therefore stands not for
an incomplete functional expression with an empty place. Of course, it would be no
less irritating to translate ‘F (x)’ with an expression like ‘x falls under the concept
F ( )’, or with ‘. . . is an F . . .’, namely with an expression with more than just one
argument place; this expression would be completely unintelligible. Since ‘F ( )’, as
the expression of an unsaturated propositional function, is an indivisible expression,
the use of the bare letter ‘F’ for the schematic designation of a concept ‘F ( )’ is in fact
inadmissible.97 For this reason it is, strictly speaking, not completely correct to say ‘F
See Frege 1983, 131–32 (1979, 121): “Even if we only indicate concepts schematically by a func-
tion-letter, we must see to it that we give expression to their unsaturatedness by an accompa-
nying empty place as in Φ ( ) and X ( ). In other words, we may only use the letters (Φ, X), which
are meant to indicate or designate concepts, as function-letters, i.e. in such a way that they are
accompanied by a place for the argument (the space between the following brackets). This being
so, we may not write Φ = Χ, because here the letters Φ and X do not occur as function-letters. But
nor may we write Φ ( ) = X ( ), because the argument-places have to be filled. But when they are
filled, it is not the functions (concepts) themselves that are put equal to one another: in addition

( )’ is equivalent to the phrase ‘. . . falls under the concept F’ or with the phrase ‘. . .
is an F’. The letter ‘F’ is in all such expressions either meaningless, or it is a syllogistic
concept variable, which like α, β, γ . . . represents nothing else than a term.
The irritation can be most simply avoided if one adopts two measures which
I would like to recommend in view of all that follows. They will be helpful for
consistently observing the distinction between concepts in the syllogistic sense
and unsaturated monadic propositional functions and for avoiding the confusion
which rests on an ambiguous or unclear way of speaking.
The first measure which I recommend is technical and consist in a slight expan-
sion of our logical vocabulary. This expansion should help us to avoid entirely
Frege’s pseudo-syllogistic use of letters in translations for functional expressions. If
with the letter F or with ‘concept F’ a predicate concept is intended, namely some-
thing which can be represented only with the predicate noun contained in the
grammatical predicate ‘F (x)’, then a special mode of notation is needed to make this
predicate concept recognizable as such. For this purpose, I suggest we prefix the ex-
pression ‘F (x)’ with the sign ‘(′x)’, and call this sign the predicate prefix or predica-
tor.98 In this notation, ‘F (a)’ signifies that a falls under the concept (′x) F (x). And if
one wants to say with Frege that in ‘(∀x) (x3 = 8 ⊃x2 = 4)’ we have a subordination
of the concept of ‘the cube root of eight’ under the concept ‘the square root of four’,
one can designate these concepts conveniently with ‘(′x) (x3 = 8)’ or with ‘(′x) (x2 = 4)’.
The expressions ‘(′x) (x3 = 8)’ and ‘(′x) (x2 = 4)’ are nothing else than terms. In the
same way as β is subordinated under α in ‘A (α, β)’, a subordination of (′x) Φ (x)
under (′x) Ψ (x) occurs in ‘(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))’. In the same way as the concept vari-
ables α and β are substitutes for terms, the concept expression schemata ‘(′x) Φ (x)’
and ‘(′x) Ψ (x)’ are substitutes for terms.
The second measure I recommend is terminological and consists in reworking
Frege’s revision of the syllogistic conception of concepts. I simply prefer to preserve
the traditional, syllogistic terminology and to make Frege’s definition of concepts dis-
pensable by simply speaking only of unsaturated monadic functions whenever con-
to the function-letter there will be something else on either side of the equality sign, something
not belonging to the function.” – Frege himself nevertheless sometimes uses ‘F (x)’ as if this ex-
pression were the same sign (and capable of being supplemented in the same way) as ‘F ( )’. See
e.g., “Funktion und Begriff,” Frege 1990, 128–27 (1950, 24). This usage is somewhat inconsistent.
On the mode of notation recommended here, cf. the symbolism discussed by Kneale & Kneale
1975, 587. – Rudolf Carnap introduced the coinage ‘predicator’ to designate (unsaturated) sentential
functions. See Carnap 1947, 4; 6–7. Since ‘predicator’ is dispensable in this meaning, but coinages
are needed for newly introduced symbols, I would like to deviate from Carnap’s terminology.
82
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

cepts in Frege’s sense of this word are meant. This terminological stipulation
should serve to avoid misunderstandings which result from an ambiguous use
of words.
Frege’s idea that it is possible to translate conceptual relations into the lan-
guage of the calculus of functions and to reduce them to logically more funda-
mental expressions, which render the falling of objects under concepts, is entirely
independent of this definition. In any event, ‘conceptual relations’ means here, at
least in the first instance, relations between concepts in the syllogistic sense.
I also suggest avoiding Frege’s identification of relation concepts with relations.
I would prefer to understand relation concepts as concepts of a specific content, and
to distinguish them in this way from relations. I suggest calling multiply unsaturated
polyadic propositional functions relations from now on. In this sense ‘x is a square
root of y’, with x ≠y, is a dyadic relation. In distinction from this, the concept word
‘square root’ is the designation of a concept which, according to its content, can be
understood as a relation concept, since square roots are always only square roots of
numbers, just as mothers are always only mothers of children and sisters always
only sisters of siblings.99 Relation concepts, understood in this way, are neither rela-
tions in which several individual stand to each other, nor relations under which
pairs, triples, or other n-tuples fall. Rather, singular objects can fall under these con-
cepts in the same way as they fall under concepts in general.
It might be objected to my recommendation not to take up Frege’s function
theory of concepts – for my proposed measures ultimately amount to this recom-
mendation – that Frege’s had still another aim than to be able to introduce an
abbreviated designation for unsaturated monadic functions. In fact, Frege was
convinced that concepts must be considered as unsaturated functions, because he
believed one needs the idea of unsaturatedness of concepts and the unsaturatedness
or incompleteness of concept words in order to explain the unity of judgments in
which concepts appear – a unity that does not allow propositions to be considered
as mere series of words or names.100 Frege did not pursue merely terminological
goals with his revision of the syllogistic conception of concepts. Rather, he believed
Terms like ‘square root’, ‘mother’, or ‘north’ are designated in the logical tradition as relative
terms, in order to distinguish them from absolute terms like ‘horse’, ‘square root of four’, ‘mother
of a daughter’, or ‘north of Boston’. This distinction is useful but from the standpoint of the syllogis-
tic it concerns only the conceptual content of propositions. “Words capable of behaving as relative
terms can regularly be used also as absolute terms, though what amounts to a tacit existential
quantification in the context; thus we may say absolutely that Abraham is a father, meaning that
there is something of which Abraham is a father.” Quine 1959, 118 (§ 22). Relative terms admit an
absolute use, while conversely absolute terms do not admit a relative use.

that he possessed even a judgment-theoretical argument for this revision that equated
concepts with unsaturated monadic propositional functions. However, it is easy to
recognize that this argument was not actually a good one. It may suffice here very
briefly to indicate two of its weaknesses.
First, all logical constants which occur in a syllogistic schema for universal, par-
ticular, or singular propositions can be regarded as incomplete expressions or, if
one likes, as expressions for ‘unsaturated’ relations, and even as expressions which
each have two argument places; one for the subject concept, the other for the predi-
cate concept. In the traditional syllogistic, this was also expressly indicated by the
grammatico-syntactic concept of the copula.101 Hence if one really needs the satura-
tion analogy to be able to explain the unity of judgment, then Frege’s supposition
that concepts are unsaturated as such would still be superfluous.
Second, in any case, chemical or mechanical analogies, as they are connected
with logico-syntactic notions of saturation and binding, do not suffice to be able to
explain something like the unity of the judgment in an appropriate way. Yet since
in the framework of formal logic, no problem seems to arise which such an expla-
nation would be needed to solve, neither does it need to be provided within this
framework.102
§ 28 Remarks on the Function Theory of Concepts
In my estimation, Frege would have done better to stick consistently to the tradi-
tional use of the word ‘concept’ in order to avoid ambiguities. He often avails himself
of a way of speaking according to which, for example, the equation 22 = 4 says that
two falls under the concept square root of four. This sounds as if he believes that the
concept under which this number falls is designated by the syllogistic concept ex-
pression ‘square root of four’ (cf. Frege 1983, 17–18 [1979, 16]). But according to his
own concept theory, this way of speaking is not correct. For as we have said con-
cepts, which are functions in Frege’s sense, cannot be designated by closed nominal
phrases, but only by functional expressions of the form Φ ( ) that require supplemen-
tation. These are essentially indivisible expressions, whose empty places are sup-
posed to indicate the “unsaturatedness” of concepts (Frege 1983, 131 [1979, 121]).
Jonathan Barnes has extensively discussed this objection against Frege’s argument in his
1996, 175–219.
Frege seems not to have known or studied the more demanding explanations of the unity of
the judgment as they were developed, e.g., in Kant’s theory of apperception or in Hegel’s doctrine
of the concept.
84
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

When Frege speaks of an object falling under a ‘concept F’, this way of speak-
ing clearly stems from an embarrassment. He thus writes:
I use the word ‘concept’ in such a way that ‘a falls under the concept F’ is the general form
of a judgeable content which deals with one object a and which remains judgeable what-
ever else one puts for a. And in this sense, ‘a falls under the concept “unequal to itself”’ is
equivalent to ‘a is unequal to itself’ or ‘a does not equal a’. (Frege 1986/1950, § 74)103
There are three things that Frege wants to note here. First, he wants to explain what
“the general form” of singular statements is. Second, he wants to indicate the fact
that the general form of singular statements should not be confused with the gen-
eral form of statements which deal with pairs, triples, etc. Third, he wants to inform
us about his use of words.
As for the first point, Frege designates the singular statement as a “judgeable
content which deals with an object a and which remains judgeable whatever else
one puts for a.” He means that “the general form” of singular statements can be
rendered with a functional expression of the form Φ (a). That is, all more specific
forms of singular statements correspond to expressions which can arise in a two-
fold manner, namely: first, by replacing ‘Φ ( )’ with an n-place functional expression
with n > 1, whose empty places are without exception filled by ‘a’; and second, by
replacing the individual constant a in an expression of the form Φ (a) with a sign
which is distinct from ‘a’ but which likewise stands for an individual object. Fur-
ther below, in § 33, I will come back to the thesis contained in this point that ‘a falls
under the concept F’ is the general form of singular statements.
Concerning the second point, Frege writes:
Just as ‘a falls under the concept F’ is the general form of a judgeable content which deals
with an object a, so can we take ‘a stands in the relation ϕ to b’ as the general form for a
judgeable content which deals with the object a and the object b. (Frege 1986/1950, § 74)
Here one should take note of the fact that Frege does not really see the distinction
between the general form of a statement dealing with an individual falling under
a concept and the general form of a statement dealing with a relation between
two (or more) individuals to consist in a distinction of form concerning the incom-
plete functional expressions as such. He rather sees it exclusively in a distinction
of the content through which their argument places are filled. (Frege’s talk of the
“form” of a “content” can easily belie this fact.)
In another place, Frege writes in a corresponding way: “If I say ‘Plato is a human,’ I am not as
it were giving Plato a new name – the name ‘human’ – but I am saying that Plato falls under the
concept human.” Frege 1983, 231 (1979, 214). Cf. also the example in “Funktion und Begriff,” Frege
1990, 133 (1960, 30).
1 A Translation Program § 28
85

As for the third point, it expresses a difficulty which is connected with the
revision of the traditional conception of concepts. Frege wants to clarify his new,
function-theoretical understanding of the word ‘concept’, but he does this as if a
concept in this understanding were something which could stand in place of a
syllogistic concept variable. That is, he does this as if the concept (in his new
usage) under which a is supposed to fall is a concept (in the old usage) under
which a is supposed to fall, when it falls under F. In order to explain the new
usage of the word, he would have really needed to clearly distinguish it from the
old usage, instead of confounding both usages together.104
Thus it would have ultimately been basically reasonable if, in place of his defi-
nition, Frege would have told us that the function theory of concepts uses the word
‘concept’ in such a way that a phrase like ‘a falls under the concept F’ is actually
not about a concept at all.105 For according to this theory, when ‘F (a)’ is true, it is
not ‘F’ but rather an open proposition of the form ‘. . . is an α’ that is supposed to
stand for the concept under which a falls. And this open proposition is not equiva-
lent to ‘F’ or ‘α’, but rather to ‘. . . falls under the concept F’ when ‘F (a)’ is equiva-
lent to ‘a falls under the concept F’.
Of course, Frege also has a systematic reason to sometimes use the function
letter ‘F’ as if it did stand for a closed expression, and to speak of a concept square
root of four, a concept horse, or a concept F, as if the concepts designated in this
way were not unsaturated propositional functions. Namely, in his system Frege
wants to permit function signs to be replaced by bound function variables, so that
the latter could occur in quantifiers (see Begriffsschrift, § 9).106 This occurrence
assumes that function letters may be treated as if they were object variables and
as if they carried no empty places. Along these lines, Frege suggests that the func-
tion variable ‘Φ’ in an expression of the form (∀Φ) (. . . Φ . . .) stands for ‘the
property Φ, whatever Φ may be’ (Frege 1879, 61, § 26 [1967, 60]) among all possible
properties, such as, for example, “the property of being a heap of beans” (Frege
Perhaps the fact that Frege’s way of designating concepts and functions is fluctuating, as
when he indicates sometimes ‘F’, sometimes ‘F ( )’, and sometimes ‘F (x)’ as signs for functions,
helps explain why Frege also wavers in his conception of what a concept word is: sometimes he
supposes that the copula ‘. . . is . . .’ belongs to it (see Frege 1983, 192 [1979, 178]), sometimes he
supposes that concept words are those which can be preceded by the expressions ‘all’, ‘some’,
etc. (See the letter to Heinrich Liebmann from August 25, 1900, in Frege 1976, 150 [1980, 92], and
Frege 1983, 230 [1979, 213]).
In his article “Über Begriff und Gegenstand” of 1892, Frege (1990, 170) himself expressly indi-
cated that in his theory a certain concept, like, e.g., the concept horse, is in truth not a concept.
“On the other hand, it may also be that the argument is determinate and the function inde-
terminate.” Frege 1879, 17 (1967, 23). §§ 10 and 11 then elucidate how indeterminate functions are
to be represented by the use of variables.

1879, 64 [1967, 62]). Such a property is strictly speaking not an unsaturated func-
tion, but rather something that corresponds to a syllogistic concept expression
which carries no empty place.
The license to treat function variables as if they were object variables leads
Frege to draw an analogy between the subsumption of an object under a concept
and the subsumption of a first-level concept under a second-level concept. The
proposition ‘(∃Φ) (∃x) Φ (x)’ states that there is a propositional function with the
property of applying to an object. It is related to the proposition ‘(∃x) (x2 = 4)’ like
the proposition ‘(∃x) F (x)’ is related to the proposition ‘F (a)’. Now Frege sup-
poses that, just as ‘F (a)’ states that the object a falls under the concept F, so ‘(∃x)
(x2 = 4)’ states that the concept square root of four falls within the concept “‘there
is’-existence” (Frege 1976, 151 [1980, 93]). Instead of speaking twice here of the re-
lation of subsumption, Frege prefers to speak in the first case of falling under a
concept, and in the second case of falling within a concept. This is just supposed
to underscore that a concept such as square root of four is not an object but rather
a “first-level concept,” while the concept within which it falls, namely, the concept
of “‘there is’-existence” (i.e., the concept of being a satisfied concept) is a “second-
level concept” (Frege 1976, 150–51 [1980, 93]). Now, ‘(∃x) (x2 = 4)’ can also be ren-
dered with the words: ‘some object is a square root of four,’ or with the words:
‘There is at least one square root of four’. These propositions correspond to the sche-
mata ‘Some object is an α’ and ‘There is at least one α’, respectively. This circum-
stance finally prompts Frege to state explicitly:
Concept words come with the indefinite article and with words like ‘all’, ‘some’, ‘many’, etc.
(Frege 1976, 150 [1980, 92])
For what Frege calls a first-level concept can be subsumed under a second-level
concept only if it is a concept which can be represented by a syllogistic concept
variable. Open propositions, by contrast, which represent an unsaturated mo-
nadic propositional function, are meaningless expressions on their own and
hence unsuited to designate concepts capable of being subsumed.
Hence, Frege is not at all in a position to maintain his function theory of con-
cepts even somewhat consistently.
In his famous first letter to Frege from June 16, 1902, Russell, referring to the
passage in § 9 of the Begriffsschrift we have just discussed, calls attention to the
hazards connected to the use of the bound function variables, since he under-
stood this as the source of the contradiction which later became known as ‘Rus-
sell’s paradox’. Russell writes:
I have encountered a difficulty only on one point. You assert (p. 17) that a function could
also constitute the undefined element. This is what I used to believe, but this view now

seems to me dubious because of the following contradiction: Let w be the predicate of being
a predicate which cannot be predicated of itself. Can w be predicated of itself? From either
answer follows its contradictory. We must therefore conclude that w is not a predicate. Like-
wise, there is no class (as a whole) of those classes which, as wholes, are not members of
themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable set does not
form a whole. (Frege 1976, 211 [1980, 130–31])
Russell here calls attention to the fact that an expression of the form (∀Φ) (. . . Φ
. . .) refers to an argument domain which contains neither mere objects, to which
bound individual variables refer, nor mere concepts, which are predicates of objects
falling under them, but is populated by such suspicious entities as the predicates of
predicates of which w is an example. Predicates of predicates are necessarily enti-
ties which are neither unsaturated monadic propositional functions nor first-level
concepts in Frege’s sense; they are rather concepts in the syllogistic sense. For a
predicate can be predicated of itself only if it is a predicate concept, namely a logical
predicate in the sense of this expression discussed above. Only in propositions like
‘the w is a w’ or ‘a w is a w’ – with a term w – can w be predicated of itself.107 Pred-
icates of which another predicate, or itself, can be predicated must also be suited to
appear as the subject concept. Yet these must be precisely predicates of a specific
conceptual content. That predicates of predicates can belong to the argument do-
main of a function of the form (∀Φ) (. . . Φ . . .) is due to the fact that, though this
form admits unsaturated propositional functions as values of bound variables, it
comes with no provisions prohibiting concepts in the syllogistic sense of this word
from saturating these functions. Thus, through the saturation of Φ ( ), a proposi-
tional function of the form Φ (Ψ ( )), with Φ = Ψ or with Φ ≠Ψ, can arise, and then,
through the tacit metamorphosis of Ψ ( ) into a concept of the form (′x) Ψ (x), a pred-
icate of a predicate of the form Φ ((′x) Ψ (x)) is formed.
The letter in which Frege immediately reacted to Russell’s note shows that
Frege recognized at once the extensive consequences of this problem. The contra-
diction Russell discovered, he says, “has rocked the ground on which I meant to
build arithmetic” (Frege 1976, 213 [1980, 132]). Frege recognized immediately that
foundational assumptions of his work Basic Laws of Arithmetic had become frail,
since their implicit reference to unrestricted argument domains of predicates of
predicates makes it possible to derive contradictory consequences (see Frege
1976, 213–15 [1980, 132–35]).
It should be mentioned here only in passing that no deeper logical problem arises when it
happens that two propositions of the form ‘the w is a w’ and ‘the w is not a w’ are both false. For
this problem immediately dissolves if one is only ready to treat these propositions as cases of the
application of the weak logical square of assertoric opposition, as per § 12.

The heart of the problem that Frege here ran up against, and which made his
project of grounding arithmetic on the basis of pure logic miscarry, was the fact
that with the binding of variables for propositional functions by quantifiers, the
given argument domain was expanded beyond its intended size. With this expan-
sion, the saturation of unsaturated propositional functions by unsaturated propo-
sitional functions was tacitly permitted without restriction.
Frege’s motive, already in the Begriffsschrift of 1879, for admitting the occur-
rence of function variables in quantifiers is connected with his project of deduc-
ing the principle of mathematical induction from the axioms of the Begriffsschrift
with the help of the definitions from the third part of that work. For in the frame-
work of this deduction he saw that it was necessary to quantify over function var-
iables. This motive could have been omitted had Frege’s notation as it concerned
the inseparability of function letters and empty places been more consistent. Yet
showing this would exceed the bounds of the present investigation.108
As for Frege’s thesis of the reducibility of all conceptual relations to the basic
logical relation of objects falling under concepts, it was in any case unnecessary
to abandon for the sake of this thesis the terminology appropriate for the syllogis-
tic, according to which concepts are subject concepts or predicate concepts and
can be presented by terms. For even in a – from Frege’s perspective – logically
fundamental expression like ‘F (a)’ a concept always occurs implicitly which can
be understood as a predicate concept and designated with ‘(′x) F (x)’. The fact that
Frege could claim the “conceptual content” of a judgment should be regarded as a
“function of this or that argument” substantially depends on this circumstance.109
For something conceptual is a function of this or that argument only insofar as
there is something in it under which an object is subsumable and which, as a logi-
cal predicate, can be represented by a syllogistic concept variable.
When Frege writes, “A distinction between subject and predicate does not
occur in my way of representing a judgment,”110 it would have been helpful if he
On the question of what shape a more consistent notation in connection with the deduction of
the generalized principle of mathematical induction from the axioms of the Begriffsschrift could

is no need to introduce a higher-level predicate logic (which makes possible Russell’s Paradox).
Frege 1879, 17, § 9 (1967, 23): “For us the fact that there are various ways in which the same
conceptual content can be regarded as a function of this or that argument has no importance so
long as function and argument are completely determinate.” – In the Preface to the Begriffschrift,
Frege also used this explanation to justify the name ‘concept-script’. See Frege 1879, iv (1967, 6).

had here explicitly indicated that the grammatical distinction of subject and pred-
icate – which must be carefully distinguished from the logical subject/predicate
distinction – remains completely applicable to expressions of his concept-script.
For though a function of this or that argument, provided its value is always a
truth value, never plays the role of a logical predicate, it does always play the
role of a grammatical predicate. And the empty place of an unsaturated monadic
propositional function always corresponds to the place of a grammatical subject.
In the following, I will stick to the terminology in which a concept is under-
stood as that for which a term (i.e., a nominal expression) can stand, whether this
expression is a simple word or a nominal phrase of arbitrary complexity, and
whether it is a substantival or adjectival expression. Accordingly, when the con-
trary is not explicitly mentioned, from here on out I will speak of an object’s falling
under a concept and of the subordination of one concept to another concept always
only in such a way that a formula like ‘F (a)’ should be read as equivalent to ‘a falls
under the concept (′x) F (x)’, and a formula like ‘(∀x) (F (x) ⊃G (x))’ should be un-
derstand as subordinating the concept (′x) F (x) to the concept (′x) G (x).
The notion that concepts are entities with a special kind of empty stomach
and with a specific appetite for objects should perhaps best be treated as a mythi-
cal fable, which may have helped the calculus of functions and its language free
itself from the syllogistic, but which is dispensable for logic and which – now that
there is hardly anyone left who doubts the capability of this calculus and its lan-
guage – creates more troubles than it brings advantages.

§ 29 Subordination of Concepts in the Language of the Calculus of Functions
Since I have in the previous paragraphs (§§ 25–28) shown how Frege’s thesis of the
reducibility of all conceptual relations to relations of the form F (a) needs to be un-
derstood more precisely, I would now like to turn to the question of whether this
thesis is also substantially convincing. Is it right to assume that one could appropri-
ately translate all syllogistic schemata for universal, particular, or singular proposi-
tions into the formal language of the calculus of functions? Can one represent the
syllogistic in the language of a concept-script at all?
with these same judgments, [and conversely,] or this is not the case. The two propositions ‘The
Greeks defeated the Persians at Plataea’ and ‘The Persians were defeated by the Greeks at Pla-
taea’ differ in the first way. Even if one can detect a slight difference in meaning, the agreement
outweighs it. Now I call that part of the content that is the same in both the conceptual content.”

Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

To be able to answer these questions precisely, we first must consider once
again how universally quantified subjunctions should be properly understood, as
they came up above in Figure 9 (see § 25) as translations of syllogistic propositional
schemata.
In § 12 of his Begriffsschrift,111 Frege (1879, 23 [1967, 27]) argues that the uni-
versally quantified subjunction
(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))
may be translated both by the hypothetical expression, ‘If something has the prop-
erty Φ, then it also has the property Ψ’, and the categorical expression, ‘All Φ’s are
Ψ’s’. Here, the Greek letters Frege uses in both these translations of his formula
correspond to syllogistic concept variables. They may be appropriately replaced by
‘(′x) Φ (x)’ or by ‘(′x) Ψ (x)’, respectively. Frege proposes analogous translations for
the remaining formulae which occurred in Figure 9, which are distinguished from
each other and from the formula of subjunction just discussed only because the
sign for truth-functional negation occurs in different places in them.
Above, in §§ 1, 3, and 5, I had put forth the schemata of categorical and hypo-
thetical propositions as schemata of propositions of distinct logical form. By con-
trast, Frege (1879/1967, § 4) attaches only “grammatical significance” to the distinction
between categorical and hypothetical form. In his view, ‘every α is a β’ and ‘if some-
thing is an α, then it is a β’ are only grammatically different forms of the subordina-
tion of one concept to another concept. The common logical ‘deep structure’ of this
operation is expressed in his view through a universally quantified subjunction.
Incidentally, the view that ‘every α is a β’ and ‘if something is an α, then it is a
β’ are equivalent propositions was already held before Frege. One of the principles
of the traditional syllogistic, the so-called dictum de omni et nullo was sometimes
understood as saying that a categorical proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’ is
true if and only if a hypothetical proposition of the form ‘if something is an α, then
it is a β’ is true; and likewise that a categorical proposition of the form ‘no α is a β’
is true if and only if a hypothetical proposition of the form ‘if something is an α,
then it is not a β’ is true. Even from the syllogistic perspective, both a universal
affirmative proposition and hypothetical proposition that follows from it express
the subordination of one concept to another. Because of this, Christian Wolff (1740,
229, § 226), for example, held that categorical propositions were in truth hypotheti-
cal propositions, and reducible to the latter. Of course, Frege’s conception differs
Frege maintained the conception developed there in his later logical writings; cf. Stuhl-
mann-Laeisz 1995, 182–91.
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 29

from this view in that it does not reduce categorical to hypothetical propositions,
but rather reduces both categorical and hypothetical propositions equally to propo-
sitions which are neither categorical nor hypothetical.
I will here leave aside the question of what Frege meant when he says in § 4 of
his Begriffsschrift that the distinction between categorical and hypothetical proposi-
tions has only grammatical significance. But we must examine whether the view is
true on which this opinion of Frege’s depends, namely: whether categorical propo-
sitions of the form ‘every (′x) Φ (x) is a (′x) Ψ (x)’ and hypothetical propositions of
the form ‘if something is a (′x) Φ (x), then it is a (′x) Ψ (x)’ are reducible to univer-
sally quantified subjunctions of the form (∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x)).
First of all, I will turn to the question of how hypothetical propositions relate
to universally quantified subjunctions.
§ 30 Truth Functions and their Reduction to Non-truth-functional Forms
The issue will depend on explaining how the meaning of the hypothetical ‘if . . .,
then . . .’ relates to the meaning of the subjunction sign ‘. . . ⊃. . .’. Above, in § 6
and § 7, we have already seen that these meanings do not coincide, since ‘if . . .,
then . . .’ unlike ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ is not a truth-functional connective. The subjunction
‘A ⊃B’ corresponds to a proposition of the form ‘not A, unless B’ rather than a pro-
position of the form ‘if A, then B’. The proposition ‘3 × 7 does not equal 21, unless the
sun shines’ can be true, while the corresponding hypothetical proposition ‘if 3 × 7
equals 21, then the sun shines’ is false. The latter states that the content of the conse-
quent follows from the content of the antecedent. Hence, its truth would be incom-
patible with the sun’s not shining even once.
Frege himself clearly recognized the basic distinction between ‘if . . ., then . . .’
and ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ and correctly describes it in § 5 of his Begriffsschrift (see Frege 1879,
6, § 5 [1967, 14]). Yet he believed that the subjunction sign could adopt the meaning
of the hypothetical ‘if . . ., then . . .’ so long as it stands within the scope of a univer-
sal quantifier. In that case, the “causal connection” that is represented by a hypo-
thetical proposition could be represented by means of the subjunction sign (Frege
1879/1967, § 12). There is an essential distinction, in Frege’s eyes,112 between ‘p ⊃q’
and ‘(∀x) ([x is an (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)]’ due to the fact that in the first case,
Frege held that “In the hypothetical propositional connection we have as a rule improper propo-
sitions of such a kind that neither the antecedent by itself nor the consequent by itself expresses a
thought, but only the whole propositional complex.” See “Frege to Husserl 30.10–1.11.1906,” in Frege
1976, 103 (1980, 68). By a hypothetical propositional connection is meant here a complex correspond-
ing to the propositional schema ‘If something is an α, then it is a β’.
92
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

there are two standalone closed propositions p and q, independent of each other,
which are connected by the subjunction sign, while in the second case an inner con-
nection between the contents of two open propositions is represented by both prop-
ositions being joined together by means of a quantifier.
Of course, what Frege has overlooked here is the fact that the expression ‘(∀x)
([x is an (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)]’ is not at all equivalent to the hypothetical
expression ‘(∀x) H ([x is a (′x) Φ (x)], [x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’. Namely, while the hypotheti-
cal proposition ‘if x, whatever x may be, is a (′x) Φ (x), then x is a (′x) Ψ (x)’ is true if
and only if the content of the consequent follows from the content of the ante-
cedent, it already suffices for the truth of the subjunction ‘(∀x) ([x is an (′x) Φ (x)]
⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)]’ that there is no x to which the antecedent applies.
That is, the inner connection between two states of affairs which can be re-
presented by a universally quantified subjunction belongs to a quite different
kind of connection than the one expressed by ‘if . . ., then . . .’. Different truth con-
ditions hold for hypothetical propositions than hold for subjunctive propositions.
The truth conditions of a proposition of the form (∀x) (F (x) ⊃G (x)) corre-
spond exactly to the truth conditions of a proposition of the form b ⊂a. For a
proposition of this form to be true, it suffices that the conceptual scope b is the
null class. This follows from the set-theoretically justified theorem that says that
the null class is a sub-class of every class. Consequently, as Table 2 shows,
the formulas of the calculus of functions in Figure 9 (see § 25 above) can be collated
with the formulas of the calculus of classes in Figure 6 (see above § 17) in such a
way that for every interpretation in which a is the scope of the concept (′x) Ψ (x)
and b the scope of the concept (′x) Φ (x), the formulas of the left column of this table
are true if and only if the corresponding formulas on the right side are true. Yet
none of the expressions on the right column correspond to a (non-negated or ne-
gated) hypothetical propositional connection.113

Frege’s error in thinking that hypothetical propositions that express a subordination of one
concept to another are equivalent to definite universal affirmative categorical propositions can
probably only be explained historically. Boole had already conceived propositions of the form A
(α, β) such that they are true when there is no object with the property β. He saw them, namely,
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 30

Therefore, a careful investigation is needed in order to find out how proposi-
tions of the form (∀x) ([x is an (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)] and (∀x) H ([x is a (′x)
Φ (x)], [x is a (′x) Ψ (x)]) are related to each other.
Above, in § 7, I had already discussed the view that a hypothetical proposition
of the form H (A, B) is to be understood as an expression of strict implication.
From this view it follows that the universally quantified hypothetical connection
is to be understood as a universally quantified strict implication. ‘(∀x) H ([x is a
(′x) Φ (x)], [x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’ would then be equivalent to
‘(∀x) □(Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))’.
For the strict implication ‘A ⥽B’ is equivalent to ‘□(A ⊃B)’. Namely, since ‘A ⊃B’
is an abbreviation for ‘~ (A & ~ B)’ and ‘□. . .’ an abbreviation for ‘~ ◇~ . . .’, ‘~
(A & ~ B)’ is equivalent to ‘□(A ⊃B)’. In conclusion, ‘A ⥽B’ is per definitionem equiv-
alent to ‘~ ◇(A & ~ B)’.
However, I had already indicated in § 14 that strict implication, for its part,
can be further analyzed as a relation which is presentable by means of logical
constants of which none apart from ‘. . . & . . .’ is a truth-functional expression. It
was also already clear that since the hypothetical ‘if . . ., then . . .’ is found among
these constants, it would amount to a circular explanation if we wanted to under-
stand the form of the hypothetical proposition as a strict implication. Hence the
first question that suggests itself is whether it might be possible to reduce strict
implication completely to non-truth-functional relations, and whether it might be
possible to avoid a circle in explaining the hypothetical propositional form.
To respond to this question, I would first like to turn to the question of
whether the logical conjunction A & B might also be understood as a relation that
can be presented with only non-truth-functional signs.
That such a presentation is possible can be relatively easily seen. We can as-
sign logical conjunction as a truth function the following truth table.
as equivalent to ‘primary propositions’ of the form A = A ∙B. For expressions of this form, ‘(∀x)
(A (x) ⊃B (x))’ was a completely appropriate translation. It can be called appropriate in any case
if one ignores that ‘A’ and ‘B’ in Boole stand for conceptual scopes, while Frege interpreted these
letters as functional expressions bearing empty argument places. That Frege was ready to equate
Boole’s ‘primary propositions’ with categorical propositions can be seen in his early essay, “Über
den Zweck der Begriffsschrift” (1882), in Frege 1964a, 97–106 (1968, 89–97). On p. 101 (1968, 93), he
explicitly equates the “Boolean conception” with the “Aristotelian.”

What this table expresses can be portrayed in the following way. The first row under
the double lines says: in an interpretation in which A and B are propositions which
have one of the two truth values, it follows from the truth of A and B that A & B is
true. Hence, inference rules according to the following schema are valid:
A
B
A & B
The three subsequent rows of the truth table say that in an interpretation such
that at least one of A or B is false, A & B is false. In other words: if A & B is true, A
is also true; and further, if A & B is true, B is also true. Hence the so-called simpli-
fication rules are valid, i.e., consequence rules according to these two schemata:
A & B
A & B
A
B.
Now compare these two schemata with the following inference schemata:
A
A
B
B
A
B
What essentially distinguishes these schemata from the two prior is that they are not
valid for the same reasons as the former.114 The reason why the two prior schemata
are valid according to consequence rules can be called a logical reason. It lies in the
truth-functional meaning of ‘. . . & . . .’. By contrast, neither in the premises nor in the
conclusion of an inference corresponding to the latter two schemata does a logical
sign occur whose meaning underwrites the logically validity of such an inference.

valid rules a valid schema.

Let ‘p’ stand for a proposition which is true or false. Then an inference from p to p is
valid if and only if the content – or the meaning – of ‘p’ is everywhere (i.e., both in
the premise and the conclusion) identical. The supposition that a conclusion follows
from a premise when it has the same content as the latter suggests that there is a
content-related reason – which as such need be no merely logical reason –, on which
the supposed consequence depends. I will here and in what follows designate a rule
as logically valid or valid for a logical reason only if its validity depends on the mean-
ing of a logical constant which occurs in one of the premises or in the conclusion of
the consequence to which the rule refers. Accordingly, the schema, e.g.,
A
A
may be valid, but it is so in any case not for a logical reason (in the just mentioned
sense). It is valid at best for a content-related reason: only because the formulas for
which the letter A stands above and below the conclusion line can be interpreted as
propositions of the same content are they suited to be regarded as propositions of a
valid inference of the indicated form.115
Were the rule according to which one may infer a premise from itself valid
for a logical reason, then the rule ex falso quodlibet would be a universally valid
logical rule. This rule says that from two premises of which one negates the
other, an arbitrary conclusion may be drawn. We arrive at this rule by transform-
ing an inference of the form
A
B
A
so that
A
N A
N B.
As it happens, we find in Sextus Empiricus the argument that it cannot be proved that a
hypothetical proposition like ‘If it is day, then it is day’ is true and a proposition can follow from
itself or be implicitly contained in itself. For this already presupposes that a proof is valid if its
conclusion follows from the conjunction of its premises. See Outlines of Pyrrhonism II, 111–15.
96
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

results.116 With B = N C and assuming the principle of the affirmative use of dou-
ble negation, which allows passing from NN C to C, we then have N B = C.
Now there is no logical reason to accept the rule ex falso quodlibet as a univer-
sally valid rule. For there is no logical reason, but only a content-related reason to
accept inferences as valid whose conclusion is identical with one of their premises.
And in no way can we find a logical reason for the validity of the rule ex falso quod-
libet because it may seem as if an arbitrary pair of premises were equivalent to the
connection of both premises by ‘. . . & . . .’. That this is only a logical illusion (which
was nevertheless as good as universally accepted in the logic of the twentieth cen-
tury) which incidentally can easily be dissolved, can be shown as soon as one has
only made it clear that it is completely permissible, logically speaking, to accept all
the modes of inference and consequence which depend on the truth table for A & B
as logical rules and yet at the same time to refuse the logical validity of any inference
whose conclusion A is equivalent to one of its premises and in which no premise of
the form H (A, H (B, A)) appears.117
The supposition that an inference from two premises p and q is valid whose
conclusion coincides with one of its premises, for example with p, is equivalent to
the supposition that p follows from p and q. This supposition is in turn equivalent
to the supposition that p follows from q, if p. This supposition can be rendered
symbolically as ‘H (p, H (q, p))’. It is an application of what I would henceforth
like to call the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason. For this is what will I
call the supposition that in every interpretation in which A and B are true or false
propositions, the proposition H (A, H (B, A)) is true. This principle says that, so
long as A is true, the truth of an arbitrary proposition B is the sufficient condition
for the truth of A. Now, the premise ‘p & q’ apparently admits an analysis in
which it combines not two but three premises in total, namely, ‘p’, ‘q’, and ‘H (p, H
(q, p))’. The rule according to which A arises out of A & B hence corresponds to
this mode of inference:
A
B
H (A, H (B, A))
A
The right to this transformation rests on the validity of a metarule, which is traditionally
called reductio ad absurdum and will be more precisely discussed in § 44 of Part II of this essay.
For Paul Hoyningen-Huene (1998, 124), there is an insoluble connection here; he writes “the
validity of this inference [from A & B to A] has up to now never yet been doubted.” And he adds
with a rhetorical question: “How should one even attack this: if the truth of A and of B is admit-
ted, then one may of course infer to the truth of A (or that of B).”
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 30
97

The logical validity of this mode of inference depends on supposing that A can be
logically derived on the basis of a twice-over application of modus ponendo ponens
from A and B, so long as a proposition of the form H (A, H (B, A)) is true (thus so
long as the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason is a valid principle).
Hence, the logical conjunction A & B is not equivalent in all cases to a pair of
formulas consisting only of A and B. Only on the assumption that the principle of
the arbitrary sufficient reason is valid may the logical conjunction of A and B and
the truth function A & B be interchanged.
This of course does not mean that one could not still supply the connective
‘. . . and . . .’ with a second meaning that deviates from ‘. . . & . . .’: rather, ‘p and
q’ can also stand for ‘both p and q’ and be understood as an expression which
arranges p and q as a pair of compatible propositions, without stating that one of
the sub-propositions is true taken on its own. ‘Both . . . and . . .’ can be introduced
as a special logical constant. I will use the abbreviation ‘(. . ., . . .)’ for it. ‘(A, B)’ is
not a truth-functional expression. The meaning of
‘(. . ., . . .)’
can rather be fixed by way of definition so that for every interpretation in which
A and B are true or false propositions,
(1) (A, B) is true if A and B are both true or N (A, B) is false;
(2) (A, B) is false if it is possible that A or B is false and therefore N A or N B true.
With the definition we have established, the meaning of ‘(A, B)’ is fixed in such a
way that this expression contains no truth-functional connective. Because of this,
in the main column of the truth table for (A, B), there is a question mark in all the
places in which the analogous column of the truth table for A & B contains the
value F. Only in the first row do the two truth tables agree:
The question marks express the fact that, in interpretations in which two formu-
las A and B have one of the two truth values, the value F for A or B does not suffi-
ciently determine that (A, B) has the value F.

In no interpretation in which A and B are true or false, does A or B follow logi-
cally from (A, B). Consequently, it does not follow logically from the falsity of A or
from the falsity of B that (A, B) is false. That is, an inference according to the schema
A
B
(A, B)
is indeed valid for a logical reason. But neither
(A, B)
A
nor
N A
N (A, B)
holds for a logical reason. ‘(A, B)’ is therefore an expression with which a conjunc-
tion of premises, namely, a pair of premises A and B, can be represented without
its being implicitly supposed that from A and B follows A, or that so long as A and
B stand for true or false propositions, ‘H (A, H (B, A))’ is a true proposition.
Since the logical relation which ‘(. . ., . . .)’ stands for is not a truth function, in
what follows I will call it non-truth-functional (logical) conjunction; it can also be
called elementary conjunction. It is elementary insofar as the meaning of ‘. . . & . . .’
can be reduced to the meaning of ‘(. . ., . . .)’. This results from the following consid-
eration. The conjunction of premises ‘(A, B)’ according to the just stated definition is
true if both premises A and B are true. Now we have just seen that the meaning of
‘(A, B)’ as it were turns into the meaning of ‘A & B’ when, for every interpretation in
which A and B are true or false propositions, not only A and B but also H (A, H (B,
A)) is true. Given the latter’s truth, an inference from A and B to A is valid. Such an
inference can be reduced to a pair of inferences of which the first is logically valid
and infers from A and B to (A, B), while the second contains the non-logically valid
conclusion of A from (A, B). The supposition that both A and B follow from (A, B) is
thus based on the premise that H (A, H (B, A)) is true. That is, one may substitute the
expression ‘A & B’ for the expression
‘(A, B)’
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 30

if and only if ‘(A, B)’ is used on the assumption that the principle of the arbitrary
sufficient reason is valid.
This situation can be portrayed in still another way. Namely, since a use of
propositions of the form (A, B) under the assumption that the principle of the ar-
bitrary sufficient reason is valid occurs if and only if it is supposed that conjunc-
tions of the form ((A, B), (H (A, B), A), H ((A, B), B))) are true, it is correct to say
that ‘A & B’ is equivalent to
‘((A, B), (H (A, B), A), H ((A, B), B)))’.
Strictly speaking, this expression renders the meaning of ‘A & B’ even more pre-
cisely than the truth table for A & B. For in the truth table, the case in which an
expression of the form N C occurs in A or in B (or in both) remains unconsidered.
But such is exactly the case in which it is apparent that ‘A & B’ becomes a truth
function only when the validity of the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason
is tacitly assumed. For only on this assumption does it hold quite generally that
the truth value of A & B is fixed truth-functionally, i.e., through the truth values
of A and B alone. On the same assumption, the expression ‘((A, B), (H (A, B), A),
H ((A, B), B)))’ also becomes a truth function. For on this assumption, its sub-
expression ‘(H (A, B), A), H ((A, B), B))’ becomes (in every interpretation in which A
and B are true or false propositions) a true proposition. Assuming the truth of the
latter, ‘(A, B)’ is a proposition which, like ‘A & B’, is true if and only if its sub-
propositions are true, and false if and only if they are not.118
Hence, ‘A & B’ is at bottom only an abbreviation for a more complex expres-
sion which lets its logical structure be more clearly recognized. Accordingly, the
meaning of ‘. . . & . . .’ can be definitionally reduced to the meanings of ‘(. . ., . . .)’
and ‘H ( )’, whereas an inverse reduction of the meaning of ‘(. . ., . . .)’ to the mean-
ings of ‘. . . & . . .’ or other (truth-functional or non-truth-functional) expressions
cannot be accomplished. Non-truth-functional logical conjunction is to that extent
more elementary than the truth-functional one.
We may now also regard non-truth-functional negation as elementary, namely,
as elementary in relation to truth-functional negation, for the same reason we re-
gard the conjunction represented by ‘(. . ., . . .)’ as elementary. Above, in § 10, it had
turned out that ‘~ A’ is substitutable for ‘N A’ if and only if ‘N A’ is used on the
assumption that the principle of the affirmative use of double negation is valid for
pairs of propositions of the form A and N A. Now, this expression is used in this
A more exact exposition of this idea can be found in Appendix 3.
100
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

way if and only if it is supposed that both N A and H (NN A, A) hold. We may now
abbreviate the expression ‘both N A and H (NN A, A)’ with:
‘(N A, H (NN A, A))’.
‘~ A’ is thus equivalent to this expression. It represents the meaning of ‘~ A’ even
more exactly than the truth table (depicted in § 9) for ~ A. For this table disregards
the case in which an expression of the form N B is contained in A. Though the truth
table is supposed to be universally valid, it is only so if we implicitly suppose in
using it that the principle of the affirmative use of double negation also holds for
pairs of propositions of the form A and N A. Precisely this supposition is made ex-
plicit with the expression ‘(N A, H (NN A, A))’. It, too, becomes an expression for a
truth function only if the validity of H (NN A, A) is assumed. Assuming this validity,
N A is true if and only if A is false, and false if and only if A is true.
‘~ A’ is thus at bottom only an abbreviation for a more complex expression
which lets its logical structure be more clearly recognized. Accordingly, the meaning
of ‘~ . . .’ can be definitionally reduced to the meaning of ‘N . . .’, ‘H ( )’ and ‘(. . ., . . .)’.
By contrast, there is no question of a reducibility of the meaning of ‘N . . .’ to the
meaning of ‘~ . . .’ or of other (truth-functional or non-truth-functional) expressions.
For this reason, non-truth-functional negation is more elementary than truth-
functional negation.
Let us consider the following situation as well: all dyadic truth functions can
be presented by means of the signs ‘. . . & . . .’ and ‘~ . . .’.119 Therefore, since both
truth-functional negation and truth-functional conjunction may be replaced by ex-
pressions containing exclusively non-truth-functional signs, all truth functions can
be rendered with non-truth-functional signs. (See Appendix 3.)
Even strict implication can now be completely reduced to non-truth-functional
relations. Namely, if we replace one of the formulas which according to § 14 renders
the meaning of ‘A ⥽B’, that is, the formula ‘~ ◇(. . . & ~ . . .)’, with ‘NM (. . ., N . . .)’,
then
‘NM (A, N B)’
results. ‘A ⥽B’ may be used as a substitute for this formula if and only if the new
formula is used on the assumption that the principles of the affirmative use of
There can be no more than 16 different value distributions which are presentable in the main
column of truth tables for dyadic truth functions. As can be seen from Table 4 in Appendix 3, for
each of the 16 possible value distributions there corresponds a negated or non-negated logical
conjunction.
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 30

double negation and arbitrary sufficient reason are valid. Or, put differently, ‘A ⥽B’
is equivalent to a conjunction which connects the expression ‘NM (A, N B)’ with for-
mulas which result from the application of these two principles to it. Let H (NN C, C)
and H ((D, E), D) be valid for arbitrary formulae C, D, and E. Then ‘A ⥽B’ is equiva-
lent to:
‘(NM (A, N B), (H (NN C, C), H ((D, E), D)))’.120
In this formula the hypothetical propositional connective occurs (twice). Hence,
we are precluded from regarding the hypothetical connective (‘if . . ., then . . .’) as
equivalent to the expression for the relation of strict implication. But we can now
explain the hypothetical propositional connective non-circularly. It should be in-
terpreted (according to § 3) like Lewis interpreted strict implication, namely, so
that (see § 7 above) ‘H (A, B)’ states: it is impossible that A is true and B is false.
Only one should no longer render this interpretation, as Lewis attempted, with
truth-functional signs; nor should one assume that with the use of the hypotheti-
cal propositional connective, as with the use of strict implication, the validity of
the principles of the affirmative use of double negation and arbitrary sufficient
reason is tacitly assumed. Rather we may proceed henceforth on the assumption
that ‘H (A, B)’ is simply equivalent to the expression we just discovered,
‘NM (A, N B)’.
Since ‘NM (A, N B)’ expresses, for its part, that A and N B are incompatible with
each other, we can also say that the hypothetical propositional connective ‘H (A, B)’
not only expresses that B follows from A, but also that A is incompatible with the
elementary negation of B.121
§ 31 An Extension of the Language of the Syllogistic
In § 30 it was shown that the meaning of all truth-functional signs can be ex-
plained without difficulty by completely reducing them to the meaning of non-truth-
functional-signs, which (except for the sign for elementary conjunction) belong to the
elementary language of the syllogistic. A comparable reduction in the opposite

direction has proved to be impossible. Thus the view that non-truth-functional syllo-
gistic propositional connections can be adequately rendered in the calculus of func-
tions has turned out to be an error: the syllogistic propositional connectives have for
their part proved to be elementary expressions. It is thus the case – quite contrary to
that view – that we can render all of what we can express with truth-functional con-
nectives in a language whose vocabulary – apart from the sign for elementary conjunc-
tion – belongs exclusively to the elementary language of the syllogistic.
For this reason, it is not possible in particular to reduce hypothetical expressions
to subjunctive expressions. Above, in § 30, I had raised the question of how two
propositions of the form ‘(∀x) ([x is a (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’ and ‘(∀x) H ([x is
a (′x) Φ (x)], [x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’ are related. We can now answer this question if we,
first, explain how ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ and ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ are logically related and, second, ex-
plain how the inner connection between the open sub-propositions ‘x is a (′x) Φ (x)’
and ‘x is a (′x) Ψ (x)’ is to be understood so that it expresses that the individual varia-
bles that occur free in them are bound together by means of a universal quantifier.
Concerning the first question, we can immediately establish a similarity be-
tween the relations A ⊃B and H (A, B) merely by bearing in mind that ‘A ⊃B’ is an
abbreviation of ‘~ (A & ~ B)’, and ‘H (A, B),’ according to § 30, may be replaced by
‘NM (A, N B)’. The expression for strict implication, ‘~ ◇(A & ~ B)’, which is analo-
gous to the latter one, is distinguished from ‘~ (A & ~ B)’ only by the appearance
of the modal sign ‘◇’. The expression ‘~ ◇. . .’ is simply a modal strengthening of ‘~
. . .’, just as ‘NM . . .’ is a modal strengthening of ‘N . . .’. That is, ~ A is derivable from
~ ◇A, just as N A is from NM A. For, according to the principle ab esse ad posse
valet consequentia, ◇A follows from A, or M A from A. Hence, just as A ⊃B follows
from A ⥽B, N (A, N B) also follows from NM (A, N B). The logical relationship be-
tween A ⊃B and H (A, B) can hence be precisely described in the following way:
It resulted from § 30 that, when the expressions ‘N C’ and ‘(D, E)’ are used on
the assumption that the principles of the affirmative use of double negation and the
arbitrary sufficient reason are valid, then ‘~ C’ or ‘D & E’ may be substituted by ‘N C’
and ‘(D, E)’ respectively. Hence, on the same assumption, ‘~ (A & B)’ (and conse-
quently also ‘A ⊃B’) are substitutable by ‘N (A, N B)’. Since according to § 30, on the
same assumption ‘A ⥽B’ may be substituted by ‘H (A, B)’, and A ⊃B follows from
A ⥽B, A ⊃B follows from H (A, B) on this assumption. Hence, on this assumption,
the move from H (A, B) to A ⊃B can be carried out by a merely syntactic transfor-
mation of the formulas.
As for the other question, which pertains to the peculiarity of quantified subjunc-
tions and which concerns the inner connection between the open sub-propositions of
such subjunctions, the universal quantifier occurring in both expressions ‘(∀x) ([x is
a (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’ and ‘(∀x) H ([x is a (′x) Φ (x)], [x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’ does
not bring it about that, say, the open sub-propositions within its scope should both be
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 31
103

expanded into universal propositions. Rather, the universal quantifier expresses that
for every individual of the given domain, namely, for every individual x, what the
expression within its scope states applies to the domain as a whole. In this way, the
universal quantifier brings it about that the individual variables it binds refer to
the same individual in all places of their occurrence. The subjunctive expression
‘(∀x) ([x is a (′x) Φ (x)] ⊃[x is a (′x) Ψ (x)])’
is thus equivalent to the following propositional schema:
‘some x, whatever individual of the given domain x may be, is not a (′x) Φ (x)
unless it (namely, that x) is a (′x) Ψ (x).’
The corresponding hypothetical structure is the propositional schema
‘if some x, whatever individual of the given domain x may be, is a (′x) Φ (x),
then it (namely, that x) is a (′x) Ψ (x).’
It can be recognized relatively easily that the antecedent in both cases is a particular
proposition, while the second proposition in both cases is a singular proposition.
For in the sub-expression that appears in both antecedents, ‘x, whatever individual
of the given domain x may be’ can be appropriately replaced by a conceptual con-
stant, e.g., by a nominal phrase ‘individual of the domain given with x’. The pronoun
‘it’ in both consequents refers to the same object treated in the antecedents and is
therefore equivalent to ‘that individual of the domain given with x’. It can therefore
appropriately be replaced by an expression which is composed, in logico-syntactic
terms, of the logical constant for singular propositions, ‘that . . .’, and the logical sub-
ject ‘individual of the domain given with x’. We can in this way render both the
universally quantified expression and the universally quantified hypothetical ex-
pression with equivalent propositional schemata, each of which are composed of
schemata of particular and singular propositions, respectively. Let ‘ξ’ be an abbrevi-
ation for the conceptual constant ‘object’, or, more precisely, for the conceptual con-
stant ‘individual of the non-empty domain of individuals which are designated by
an individual variable v’. The above mentioned universally quantified subjunction
is then equivalent to the propositional schema
‘I ((′v) Φ (v), ξ) ⊃Ạ((′v) Ψ (v), ξ)’.
104
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

Likewise, the above mentioned universally quantified hypothetical expression is
equivalent to the propositional schema
‘H (I ((′v) Φ (v), ξ), Ạ((′v) Ψ (v), ξ))’.
Since the expressions ‘(′v) Φ (v)’ and ‘(′v) Ψ (v)’ play the same role as concept varia-
bles, namely they only designate those empty places which are filled by terms, we
may say that the second (hypothetical) propositional schema belongs to an extended
syllogistic language (in the sense of § 15), which is distinguished essentially from the
language of the elementary syllogistic only by the use of the conceptual constant ξ.
The first (subjunctive) propositional schema can be transformed into the language
of the syllogistic, as extended in the same way, so long as one includes the logical
constant for elementary conjunction in this language. Furthermore, the translation
here of ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ with ‘N (. . ., N . . .)’ assumes the validity of the principles of the
affirmative use of double negation and the arbitrary sufficient reason.
One can likewise translate the negations of universally quantified subjunctions,
as they appeared above in Figure 9 (see § 25), in a non-truth-functional language;
they are equivalent to existentially quantified conjunctions of the forms (∃v) (Φ (v))
& Ψ (v)) and (∃v) (Φ (v)) & ~ Ψ (v)), respectively. We can appropriately render these
with expressions of the form A & B, in which I ((′v) Φ (v), ξ) is put in place of A and
Ạ((′v) Ψ (v), ξ) is put in place of B.
§ 32 The Categorical Form in the Language of the Calculus of Functions
After showing in § 31 that Frege’s view that it is possible to represent hypothetical
propositions with universally quantified subjunctions is untenable, I would now like
to examine whether his view that it is possible to render categorical propositions
with universally quantified subjunctions is tenable. He thought we could in this way
“reduce all conceptual relations” to the “basic logical relation” of “an object’s falling
under a concept.”
There is an immediate reason to doubt the tenability of this view. We have al-
ready seen in the beginning of § 30 that Frege’s interpretation of the strong logical
square, as expressed in Figure 9 (see § 25), is incompatible with the rules of the logi-
cal square in precisely the same way as it is in the class-logical interpretation es-
poused by Hilbert and Ackermann (see Table 2 in § 30). Now, it is of course not
difficult to modify Frege’s interpretation so that all relations of the strong logical
square remain preserved. This can happen in a way that is closely analogous to the
modification which I have carried out with Figure 8 (see § 20) in the interpretation
of Hilbert and Ackermann. We must therefore ask whether Frege’s thesis that
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 32
105

categorical propositions have the logical ‘deep structure’ of universally quantified
subjunctions can be rescued in this way.
In order to maintain the relations of the strong logical square, we could attempt
to explain A, E, I, and O forms through the definitions as they are summarized in
the following Table 3.
Only two of the four definitions here involve an adjustment to Frege’s reading of the
strong logical square. Definition 1 explains the A form with the help of a supplemen-
tary addition, namely, with the help of the second member of its conjunction. Defini-
tion 4 involves a corresponding adjustment in the explanation of the O form. For the
O form corresponds to the truth-functional negation of an A form proposition. Both
adjustments successfully adhere to the principle of qualitative existential import, so
that the affirmative propositions, but not the negative propositions, contain existence
assumptions. Hence, with these definitions, all rules of the strong logical square re-
main in force.122
Now, I have shown in § 31 that universally quantified subjunctions, as they
occur in all four definitions in Table 3, must be treated from a logical point of view
as if they were expressions of the form A ⊃B. However, even if the rules of the
strong logical square are valid for functional expressions as they appear in the mid-
dle column of this table, this need not suggest that these expressions represent the
sense of A, E, I, and O propositions. Rather, the fact that these rules are valid can be
explained simply by the fact that the logical relations of the strong logical square
are all preserved when one replaces A, E, I, and O propositions with the truth func-
tions which are introduced in Figure 10, as follows:
Strawson believed that the (strong) logical square of assertoric opposition could not be trans-
lated into the language of mathematical logic at all. Of course, the translation suggested above did
not figure among those he considered, which is curious given the fact that he did consider trans-
lations with more complex predicate-logical structure. I have commented on his reading of the
square in my essay, “Freges Kritik an der Kantischen Urteilstafel in seiner Begriffsschrift von 1879”
in my 1995, 281–95.

If one replaces the sub-expression appearing in Table 3, ‘(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Ψ (x))’
everywhere with ‘A ⊃B’, and also ‘(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃~ Ψ (x))’ everywhere with ‘A ⊃~ B’,
and finally the sub-expression ‘(∃x) Φ (x)’ everywhere with ‘C’, then four expres-
sions result from the four rows of Table 3 which correspond exactly to the four ex-
pressions in Figure 10 and for which all rules of the strong logical square are valid.
The truth functions appearing in this figure have nothing at all to do with
conceptual relationships as they concern the strong logical square, which are re-
lations between concepts. Indeed, in these truth-functional expressions there are
no letters other than metavariables which represent arbitrary propositional vari-
ables. Hence, the logical relations which obtain between the four expressions in
Figure 10 clearly do not at all depend on conceptual relations as they occur in cate-
gorical propositions.
The fact that the validity of the rules of the strong logical square remain in ef-
fect for the definitional expressions in Table 3 may thus not be taken as a sufficient
reason for letting these expressions pass as schemata of categorical propositions.
Of course, we are free to use the designation ‘categorical proposition’ as we
please. One may even, if one so wishes, designate the definitional expressions in
Table 3 as categorical propositions. But one should bear in mind that Frege’s
claim that it is possible to reduce a categorical proposition to a subjunctive ex-
pression was not supposed simply to introduce a new use of words – in which
case one would no longer need to dispute about it. Rather, his claim was supposed
to attack the view that the categorical form of propositions is logically fundamen-
tal and elementary and that the conceptual relations appearing in a categorical
proposition are not reducible to logically more fundamental relations. Indeed, in
this view categorical propositions are essentially logically simple and logically in-
dependent propositions, in which exactly two concepts, namely a subject concept
and a predicate concept, are related directly to each other by one of the logical
constants ‘A ( )’, ‘E ( )’, ‘I ( )’, ‘O ( )’, ‘Ạ( )’, and ‘Ẹ( )’ (see § 5 above).
Now the latter view would be without doubt untenable, as Frege saw, if it
could be demonstrated that categorical propositions are genuinely equivalent to
propositions which are, like these, not further analyzable into other propositions,
but are distinguished formally from categorical propositions by the fact that in
them two concepts are related to each other not directly, but indirectly, namely, by

the fact that objects are subsumed under each of these concepts. Demonstrating
this point would comport with Frege’s thesis that all conceptual relations can be
reduced to the falling of objects under concepts, and that every subordination of
concepts presupposes a subsumption of objects under concepts. But to be able to
achieve this demonstration, Frege would have to try to prove two things: first, that
categorical propositions are equivalent to propositions of a more complex struc-
ture, as is characteristic of subjunctive and hypothetical propositions; second, that
propositions of this more complex structure are likewise unanalyzable into proposi-
tions which, as simple propositions, have in turn a categorical form. Hence, Frege
would not only have to demonstrate that the same subordination which is expressed
by a proposition of the form ‘every α is a β’ can also be expressed by a proposition of
the form ‘if something is an α, then it is a β’ (and by the universally quantified sub-
junction corresponding to it). Rather, he would also have to hold that a proposition
of the form ‘if something is an α, then it is a β’ is not analyzable into simpler proposi-
tions; “only the whole complex proposition” expresses a “thought”, while “neither
the conditional proposition on its own nor the consequent on its own [expresses] a
thought”; these clauses are “improper propositions”.123 This view precludes suppos-
ing that (‘improper’) propositions of the form ‘something is an α’ or of the form ‘it is
a β’ are to be understood as if each of them could also appear as an independent,
categorical proposition.
Now, I have already shown in § 31 above that nothing at all prevents us from
understanding the words ‘something’ and ‘it’ in the context of a proposition of the
form ‘if something is an α, then it is a β’ so that they are equivalent to ‘some ξ’ or to
‘that ξ’, respectively, whereby ‘ξ’ is an abbreviation for the term ‘object’ (whereby
‘object’ means more precisely an object of the domain of individuals given with x).
On the contrary, it is not to be seen how else the words ‘something’ and ‘it’ can be
meaningfully interpreted in this context. Hence, it is immediately established that
the main clauses of propositions of the form ‘if something is an α, then it is a β’ are
in turn I and Ạpropositions. And as such they are readily suited to occur as indepen-
dent, categorical propositions.
Incidentally, we can already be seen that the clauses in ‘if something is an α,
then it is a β’ are suited to occur as independent, categorical propositions from
the fact that an inference according to modus ponendo ponens is meaningful and
universally valid when it has the following content:
If something is an α, then it is a β.
Something is an α.
Therefore, it is a β.
Thus says Frege (1976, 103 [1980, 68]) in a letter to Husserl.
108
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

The same holds for an inference of the form:
If something is an α, then it is a β.
Nothing is a β.
Therefore, nothing is an α.
This is a mode of inference which can be reduced to modus tollendo tollens when
the second premise and the conclusion are taken as negations of ‘something is a β’
and ‘something is an α’, respectively. Since the negation of a particular affirmative
proposition is a universal negative, and since from a universal negative proposition
the negation of a singular proposition of the same conceptual content follows, we
can infer from this latter negation in conjunction with the major premise the nega-
tion of its antecedent.
Since Frege’s thesis of the ‘impropriety’ of the clauses of a proposition of the
form ‘if something is an α, then it is a β’ is thus untenable, and these clauses can
rather be stated independently, it is not acceptable to ignore the logical distinction
between the independent and the dependent form in which one and the same pro-
position can occur, in one case as a categorical proposition and in another as part of
a hypothetical proposition.
It is also in light of this distinction that we can see that two different kinds of
subordination should not be confounded with each other. I will call the subordina-
tion of a concept under a concept as carried out by a categorical proposition original
or primary subordination. By contrast, I will call subordination derived or secondary
when it takes place in a hypothetical proposition. This distinction is supposed to indi-
cate that though from a categorical proposition of the form A (α, β) a hypothetical
proposition of the form H (I (β, ξ), Ạ(α, ξ) is derivable, conversely, the latter is not
derivable from the former. The dictum de omni et nullo states (1) that, if a proposition
of the form A (α, β) is true, a concept γ can always be formed such that it holds that
if some γ is a β, then it (i.e., that γ) is also an α, and (2) that, if a proposition of the
form E (α, β) is true, a concept γ can always be formed such that it holds that if some
γ is a β, then it (i.e., that γ) is not an α. (See below, Part II, Section 3, rules (III. 1) and
(III. 2).)
Given what has been said, it should be clear that propositions of the form (∀v)
Φ (v) and (∃v) Φ (v) are quite typical categorical propositions. We can translate
both formulas into the extended language of the syllogistic, since they are equiva-
lent in sequence to the propositional schemata ‘A ((′v) Φ (v), ξ)’ and ‘I ((′v) Φ (v), ξ)’.
Accordingly, all rules of the strong logical square remain in effect when one repla-
ces the formulas in Figure 3 (see § 11 above) so that the following Figure 11 arises:
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 32
109

§ 33 The Logical Form of Singular Propositions
But what about expressions of the type ‘F (a)’, that is, ‘a falls under the concept F’,
and thus what Frege called “the general form of a judgeable content which deals
with one object a and which remains judgeable whatever else one puts for a” (Frege
1986/1950, § 74; see § 28 above)? As we have seen (see § 25), in ‘F (a)’ a concept is not
subordinated to a concept, but rather an object is subsumed under a concept. Thus, it
looks as if ‘F (a)’ does not express a relation between concepts and as if it is not cate-
gorical in the sense of the discussion given above in § 5.
Frege occasionally uses the term “indefinitely indicating” for ‘a’ and for other
individual constants which can stand in the place of ‘a’ in a proposition. According
to Frege, these constants differ from proper or singular names such as ‘two’, ‘the
highest mountain,’ or ‘Julius Caesar’, which are “definitely designating” parts of a
proposition. But the former have in common with the latter that, unlike a functional
expression, they do not have an empty place, but (like ‘something’) designate an in-
dividual (Frege 1983, 280 [1979, 260]).124
Now, the question we have before us at this point is this:
Is there a fundamental distinction between the independent meaning of a
singular name and the independent meaning of expressions which we have al-
ready become acquainted with, e.g., of the type ‘that object’? For such an expres-
sion has a definite conceptual content insofar as it is composed of a concept word
(‘object’) and an expression suited to play the role of a logical constant: ‘that . . .’.
Do singular names have a conceptual content as well?
To be able to answer this question it is useful first to distinguish between two
kinds of singular names. Among the first kind I count designations which are
(
v) Φ (v)
N ( v) Φ (v)
( v) Φ (v)
N (
v) Φ (v)
Figure 11
Frege uses the designations ‘singular name’ and ‘proper name’ synonymously (cf. Frege
1983, 128 [1979, 118]), and indeed such that all object designations, as long as they are “definitely
designating” names, are proper names. Since it is usual to use the word ‘proper name’ in a nar-
rower sense, I will not follow Frege’s use of the word, but rather only use the expression ‘singu-
lar name’ as a unified term for designations of individuals or individual objects.

called, following John Stuart Mill, singular names or singular terms.125 Among the
second I count proper names in the stricter sense. The latter are distinguished
from singular terms in that they designate definite singular objects without ascribing
any (descriptive) attribute to them. Thus, for example, ‘Julius Caesar’ or ‘two’ are
proper names, while ‘the even prime number’, ‘this mountain’, or ‘Charles the Fifth’
are singular terms. Of course, singular terms can be complex enough that they also
contain proper names, as for example ‘the mother of Julius Caesar’ or ‘Charles the
Fifth’.
Let’s turn first to singular terms and suppose that the letter ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’ stands
for this kind of term. In this case, ‘a’ clearly carries with it a conceptual content.
Singular terms can be recognized in that they, just like ‘that object’, are two-part
expressions, where the first part (a definite article or demonstrative pronoun)
can play the role of a logical constant and the second part is a concept expression.
The general structure of a singular term is: ‘that α’.
That singular terms have the standard form ‘that α’ shows that calling them
singular terms is basically misleading and so actually quite inappropriate. For as
expressions of the form just discussed, they do not at all belong among the kind of
expression for which I have introduced the designation ‘term’ in § 2, for which it is
characteristic that it can play the role of a subject concept or a predicate concept.
Simply because of its form, a so-called singular term cannot take the place of a
subject or predicate concept, but always only the place of a grammatical subject
(cf. § 27). To that extent, it belongs neither (as its designation ‘singular term’
would suggest) to a subclass of terms nor to the class of terms at all.126
Incidentally, it would also be inappropriate to designate those expressions
which I have up to now designated as terms (and will continue to do so) as general
terms, to distinguish them from singular terms. For this, too, would be misleading.
This designation could be understood as if it ruled out that only one singular object
might fall under the concept for which a term stands. In truth, the number of
Mill distinguishes between singular and general terms, which he calls “singular names” and
“general names” respectively: “A general name is [. . .] a name which is capable of being truely
affirmed [. . .] of each of an indefinite number of things. An individual or singular name is a
name which is only capable of being truely affirmed [. . .] of one thing.” See Mill (1843, Vol. I,
Ch. 1, §3). Statements (‘propositions’) are singular for Mill “when the subject is an individual
name.” ‘Subject’ means here not the logical but the grammatical subject of a statement. Mill’s
explanation of singular statements does not capture statements of the form Ạ(α, β) or Ẹ(α, β).
For this reason, I do not wish to follow the widespread view adopted by, e.g., Tugendhat &
Wolf (1983, 94–95) when they treat expressions of the type ‘this horse’ as singular terms yet clas-
sificatory expressions of the type ‘horse’ as general terms. Whether these expressions refer to a
singular object or a totality of objects depends on whether they belong to a singular or universal
proposition, respectively.
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 33
111

objects each subject or predicate concept applies to (provided they are not empty
concepts) depends always only on its conceptual content. Thus, e.g., under the con-
cept designated by the term ‘even prime number’ exactly one object falls, namely
the number two – just as under the concept apostle exactly twelve individuals fall
and under the concept element of the null class no object falls at all. Yet ‘even
prime number’ should not be regarded as a singular term. This is simply because
this term, like any other, can stand both in the place of the subject concept as well
as in the place of the predicate concept of a (true or false) proposition (‘three is
(not) an even prime number’).
For this reason, it is actually quite unsuitable to speak of singular and general
terms as it is still standard in the literature influenced by Mill, as if there were two
sub-classes of the class of all terms.127 To avoid terminological confusion, I will in
the following no longer speak of singular terms, but instead only of individual iden-
tifiers when I mean expressions of the standard form ‘that α’.128
The specific conceptual content of a term which is nested in an individual iden-
tifier can be rendered with functional expressions. If it contains one or more proper
names, like ‘Caesar’s mother’ or ‘city between Köln and Bonn’, then we have individ-
ual identifiers of the form ‘that (′x) R (x, a)’, ‘that (′x) P (x, a, b)’, etc. If it contains no
proper names, like ‘that object’, then the individual identifier consists in an expres-
sion of the form ‘that (′x) F (x)’.
If ‘a’ is an individual identifier, then ‘Φ (a)’ can be consistently rendered by
expressions of the form
It is, accordingly, unsuitable to designate propositions of the form A (α, β), E (α, β), I (α, β)
and O (α, β) as general propositions as has become standard in many cases in the literature on
logical semantics. See, e.g., Tugendhat & Wolf 1983, 79–103. By general propositions are under-
stood propositions in which only general terms occur. If α and β are general terms, and if ‘that β’
is a singular term, the propositions of the form Ạ(α, β) and Ẹ(α, β) would have to be both general
as well as not general.
This designation does not allow the misunderstanding to arise, as does Mill’s talk of singular
terms, that the capacity of a term (which can always be only a part of statement or a judgment)
to refer to a definite singular object depends on something other than the context of the judg-
ment in which the term stands. No term can refer to an object on its own. Its relation to objects
can only be mediated by the logical form of the judgment. – I would like to be spared here from
going into the massive and still growing literature in the philosophy of language that busies itself
with how the ‘reference’ of singular terms to objects can be explained. An engagement with this
literature would not be very fruitful because, as far as I can see, the participants in that literature
spare themselves from entertaining the view (not discovered by me, but extensively justified by
Kant, Hegel, and others) that the objective reference (‘objectivity’) of a judgment depends on its
logical form.

Ạ((′x) Φ (x), (′x) F (x)),

Ạ((′x) Φ (x), (′x) P (x, b, c)),
etc.,
whether the term which is nested in the individual identifier contains proper
names or not. It can be easily seen that the more general form Ạ(α, β) is common
to the form of all these expressions.
We now must ask how ‘a’ in ‘Φ (a)’ is to be understood in case ‘a’ itself is a
proper name.
One might think that in this case ‘a’ bears no conceptual content, since proper
names qua proper names contain no descriptive expression. For it may seem that it
is only if individual identifiers contain descriptive expressions that they have a con-
ceptual content. In truth, however, even proper names can play their role as proper
names only if they are implicitly tied to conceptual content. That is, proper names on
their own are just as little in a position to designate a definite singular object as are
indexical expressions (e.g., ‘this here’) – unless the context in which they are used
already contains a response to the question which individual is meant by them. In no
case do context-free proper names designate something definite. The use of a proper
name always admits the further inquiry: who or what is intended? ‘This here’ – even
connected with a clear corresponding point of the finger – can, without comment,
signify the shelf, but also the stain on the shelf or the point in the stain on the shelf
or the color of this point, and still more. In a similar way, ‘Julius Caesar’, just like any
other peculiar proper name that seems to refer in a definite way, can always be
transferred to a new bearer, entirely at will. This of course holds for the names of
numbers as well: with numerals various arbitrary objects can always be named.
This well-known situation (not only familiar to ship owners and pet lovers, but
to us all) shows at once that a proper name ‘N’ can only be a singular name if it is
equivalent to a complex expression of the form ‘that bearer of the name “N”’. Ac-
cordingly, the argument letter t in ‘Φ (t)’ is equivalent to ‘that bearer of the name t’.
As an argument letter, t plays the same role in ‘Φ (t)’ which the grammatical subject
plays in the propositional schema ‘that bearer of the name t is a (′v) Φ (v)’. If we
replace the term ‘bearer of the name t’ in this schema with an abbreviation, namely,
with the conceptual constant ‘ζ’, e.g., we can say that ‘Φ (t)’ is equivalent to the ex-
pression ‘Ạ((′v) Φ (v), ζ)’. Ultimately, even ‘Φ (t)’ expresses a conceptual relation,
namely, a designation of the form Ạ(α, β).129
Since proper names and individual identifiers are disguised expressions of the form ‘that α
. . .’, I do not share the conception maintained by Fred Sommers (1982, 5; 252–81) according to
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 33
113

This result rests on an analysis of the character of proper names as singular
names which, incidentally, Frege already undertook in a similar way.
In Frege’s view, proper names, as “definitely designating” names, (thus proper
names in a stricter sense as well) are essentially bipartite. They consist first of a de-
monstrative pronoun or definite article and secondly of a “concept word”, as – sur-
prisingly – Frege himself explicitly maintains when he writes, “With the help of the
definite article or demonstrative pronoun, language forms proper names out of con-
cept-words” (Frege 1983, 193 [1979, 178]). In another context, he explicitly points out
that there are concept words which serve to designate an object: “the same word is
used to symbolize both a concept and an object falling under that concept,” for
“there is no sharp distinction made between concept and individual” in language
(Frege 1882b, 108 [1964b, 156]). “Yet in language the sharpness of the distinction [sc.
between proper names and concept words] is somewhat blurred, in that what were
originally proper names (e.g., ‘moon’) can become concept words and what were
originally concept words (e.g., ‘god’) can become proper names” (Frege 1976, 150
[1980, 92]).
It should be sufficiently clear that in these quotations Frege never means by
“concept” an unsaturated monadic propositional function, as one should rightly ex-
pect from his function theory of concepts. Rather, in these quotations he apparently
understands a concept word as an expression which can be prefixed by an indefi-
nite or definite article, consequently an expression which is capable of being used
as a term.130 In addition, these quotations also seem to deal with proper names in
the broader sense of this word, thus with singular names, among which, besides
singular names in the stricter sense, individual identifiers belong as well.
Since Frege himself, as one can see here, saw with great clarity that ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’
is equivalent to a bipartite expression of the form ‘that α’, there is good reason to
raise the question: why then could he have been so firmly convinced that ‘F (a)’ ex-
presses merely the subsumption of an object under a concept, but not at the same
time a conceptual relation, i.e., why could he think that ‘F (a)’ does not have the to-
tally standard form of a singular categorical proposition?
To be able to give this question an answer, I must go a bit further afield.
which they are anaphoric expressions. It would be more correct to say that singular propositions
in which they appear are ‘phoric’ expressions, namely, expressions which refer anaphorically or
kataphorically to other propositions, and indeed to propositions which are particular or singular.
On Frege’s use of the designation ‘concept word’ see above § 28, note 104.

§ 34 Quantifier Rules and the Weak Logical Square
The use of individual constants, through which the language of the calculus of func-
tions is distinguished essentially from the language of the syllogistic, makes one log-
ical constant characteristic of the syllogistic superfluous: an expression that can
present the singular form of a proposition. While the universal quantifier and the
existential quantifier ensure that the forms of universal and particular propositions
are presentable in the language of the calculus of functions as well, a quantifier spe-
cifically designed to present singular propositions is lacking. Just because such a
quantifier is dispensable does not mean, however, that it could not be introduced in
a sensible way, e.g., as a combination of signs like ‘(∇x) . . .’, meaning ‘(∇v) F (v)’:
‘for that individual designated by v in the given non-empty domain, it holds that v is
a (′v) F (v)’. This expression is equivalent to ‘Ạ((′v) F (v), ξ)’.
For every expression of this form, of course, the rules of the weak logical
square remain in effect. With corresponding insertions into Figure 4 (see § 12
above), the following diagram results, in which the verticals and horizontals cor-
respond exactly to the logical relations which hold according to the rules of the
weak logical square.
Since one may always abbreviate the grammatical subject of the proposition ‘that
individual designated by v in the given non-empty domain is a (′v) F (v)’ ad hoc and
replace it with an argument letter t, so that ‘(∇v) Φ (v)’ is equivalent to ‘Φ (t)’, the
language of the calculus of functions can be considerably simplified, since (as in-
deed it is standard in this language) the use of a third quantifier can be dispensed
with and individual constants can regularly take the place of individual variables
bound by this quantifier.
Of course, in this way the subalternation rules of the weak logical square also
immediately transform into quantifier rules, namely, into rules which establish the
circumstances in which a universal or existential quantifier may be introduced or
eliminated and, by the same token, when a free individual variable may be replaced
by an individual constant or when such a constant may be replaced by a bound
variable.

The subalternation relation which corresponds to the left vertical in Figure 12
immediately becomes the introduction rule of the existential quantifier (which is also
called rule of existential generalization). It permits the passage from Φ (t) to (∃v)
Φ (v) at any time, so that this pattern results:
Φ (t)
(∃v) Φ (v).
A second quantifier rule, namely the elimination rule of the universal quantifier
(which also goes by the title rule of universal instantiation) corresponds to the
right vertical in Figure 12. Yet it does not arise directly from the latter, but rather
assumes the validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation for
all types of negation. According to Figure 12, N (∀v) Φ (v) initially follows from
N Φ (t), so that according to the meta-rule of reductio ad absurdum, NN Φ (t) can be
derived directly from (∀v) Φ (v). However, according to the principle of the affir-
mative use of double negation, not only does NN A follow from A, but A follows
from NN A as well, so that ultimately Φ (t) follows from (∀v) Φ (v):131
(∀v) Φ (v)
Φ (t).
Assuming the validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation,
all elementary negations which occur in Figure 12 as it were tacitly transform
into truth-functional negations. On this assumption, the subalternation relation
which is portrayed by the right vertical in Figure 12 turns into a relation in which
rules conforming to the following schema hold as well:
~ Φ (t)
~ (∀v) Φ (v).
If we replace the formulas in Figure 12 with the expressions with which the sub-
alternation relations can be presented as quantifier rules, then we get the follow-
ing diagram:
In § 22 of his Begriffsschrift (Frege 1879/1967), Frege gave this rule the form of an axiom
which corresponds to the formula ‘(∀x) F (x) ⊃F (y)’, in which arbitrary function letters may be
substituted for ‘F’.
116
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

One can immediately notice in this diagram that, after replacing ‘N . . .’ with
‘~ . . .’, the rule of contrariety – according to which two propositions of the same
conceptual content, where one is a negated and the other a non-negated singular
proposition, can both be false but not both true – is no longer in effect. For accord-
ing to § 9, the use of ‘~ . . .’ is fixed so that two propositions which are related as A
and ~ A can neither both be true nor both false; and the validity of the quantifier
rules entails that two singular propositions of the same conceptual content,
where one negates the other, relate as A to ~ A.
This is a logical situation which threatens the consistent use of the truth-functional
negation sign, so long as no adequate supplementary provisions are made. For F (a)
and ~ F (a) can both be false, namely, when there is no object designated by ‘a’. Let us
suppose that ‘a’ is an abbreviation for ‘present king of France’ and there is no present
king of France; i.e., the concept designated by ‘present king of France’ is empty. Then,
whatever the predicate ‘(′x) F (x)’ may have for a content, both F (a) and ~ F (a) are
false. In this case, the quantifier rule of universal instantiation becomes invalid. For
insofar as there can be no interpretation for Φ (x) in which (∀x) Φ (x) is true, then the
proposition Φ (a) that follows from it becomes false in this interpretation. For the
same reason, the instantiation rule for the existential quantifier becomes invalid in
this case as well. For there can likewise be no interpretation for Φ (x) in which ~ Φ (a)
is true, since a does not exist, so that (∃x) ~ Φ (x) is false in this interpretation.
There are also circumstances in which F (a) and ~ F (a) are both true, namely
when ‘a’ in both propositions refer to different objects. Let ‘a’, for example, be equiv-
alent to ‘two’. But ‘F (a)’ states that two is an even prime number, while ‘~ F (a)’ is a
proposition about a train-line. Then both propositions may be considered as true,
although they are related as A to ~ A.
Now, if it is supposed to be guaranteed that there is in all circumstances a con-
tradictory relationship between A and ~ A, then special provisions must be made
for this guarantee. –
Frege did make special provisions in this connection. On the one hand, he stip-
ulated that ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’ should be interpreted as a latently bipartite expression con-
taining a concept word; yet, on the other hand, he insisted at the same time that
the concept whose designation is used to form the name ‘a’ must satisfy specific

demands in order to contribute to the formation of a legitimately formed singular
name. Frege writes:
With the help of the definite article or demonstrative pronoun, language forms proper
names out of concept-words. [. . .] If forming a proper name in this way is to be legitimate,
the concept whose designation is used in its formation must satisfy two conditions: 1. It may
not be empty. / 2. Only one object may fall under it. (Frege 1983, 193 [1979, 178])
The satisfaction of the first condition that Frege mentions here would guarantee
that there is no interpretation of Φ (x) in which Φ (a) and ~ Φ (a) are two false
propositions. The satisfaction of the second condition is supposed to guarantee
that two such propositions cannot both be true.
Before I go on to examine what can be said for the two demands which Frege
thinks should be placed on the legitimate formation of singular names, I would
first like to return to the question of why Frege saw it necessary to believe that the
proposition F (a) expresses not a relation between concepts, but rather only the fall-
ing of an object under a concept. An answer to this question is now possible. For
connected with the postulate that a concept may not be empty if it is supposed to
contribute to the formation of a singular name is the view that ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’ is a
mere pseudo proper name if there is no a, and consequently that in this case ‘F (a)’
is not a true or false proposition at all. Frege is thus prepared to abandon the uni-
versal validity of the bivalence principle with respect to singular propositions. After
abandoning this principle it follows at once that the proposition ‘F (a)’ expresses a
relation between empty concepts if there is no a. But since in this case ‘F (a)’ is not
a true or false proposition at all, and only true or false propositions are logically
relevant, the conceptual relation expressed is logically irrelevant. Rather, in order for
‘F (a)’ to be a logically relevant expression, it is necessary that a is an object which
falls under the concept designated by ‘F ( )’. Thus, whether (as according to Frege)
propositions of the type ‘F (a)’ are logically relevant at all depends not on the pres-
ence of a conceptual relation, but rather on whether an object falls under a concept.
§ 35 The Assumption of Non-Empty Domains
But we now must ask whether it is at all reasonable to suppose with Frege that the
formation of a singular name is only legitimate if the concept designated in its use
satisfies the following two conditions: first, that it is not empty, and second, that
only one unique object falls under it.
Let us begin with the second mentioned condition.
The satisfaction of this condition is supposed to guarantee that there is no in-
terpretation of Φ (x) in which both Φ (a) and ~ Φ (a) are true propositions. Suppose
118
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

‘a’ stands for a singular name which uses the concept of the even prime number in
its formation. This is a concept under which exactly one object falls, namely the
number two. Let ‘a’ thus abbreviate the expression ‘the even prime number’. Does
the fact that two is the only even prime number guarantee that two propositions of
the form Φ (a) and ~ Φ (a) are not both true? Clearly not. Concept expressions on
their own never indicate how many objects fall under the concept which they des-
ignate. Even a concept expression like ‘even prime number’ can at any time be
used as a name which does not refer to the number two: why should one not be
legitimately permitted, e.g., to give his favorite teacher the nickname ‘Even Prime
Number’? It is not concept expressions as such – or their contents – which are in a
position to ensure that a definite singular name is legitimately formed. Rather, it is
always only the context in which a concept expression occurs that can guarantee it
is a component of an unambiguously used singular name.132 First and foremost, this
context includes the proposition itself in which the concept expression occurs. For
it is first and foremost the logical form of the proposition, more precisely its singular
form, which makes the concept expression part of a singular name. Secondarily,
how it is determinate that the proposition is about one and only one object this de-
pends essentially on the context of the singular proposition as a whole. The problem
of the determinacy of a proposition ‘F (a)’ can in general only be solved if a suffi-
ciently large number of propositions, including ‘F (a)’, are consulted to establish that
there is exactly one object to which ‘F (a)’ refers (see Marciszewski 1981, 109).
In addition, the following should be noted: in formal-language contexts, e.g., in
the context of a series of lines which represents an inference chain in the language
of the calculus of functions, a mere stipulation suffices to ensure that one and the
same individual constant always refers to the same object in all places of its occur-
rence in the context. In the same way, a mere convention suffices to ensure that
expressions of the form Ạ(. . ., β) or Ẹ(. . ., β), which appear in a series of lines
which can present an inference chain in the elementary language of the syllogistic
can always refer to the same object in all places of their occurrence. Thus, from a
logical point of view, the guarantee of the unambiguity of singular names presents
no problem that would require special provisions for its solution.
However, Frege’s other prescription that a concept may not be empty if it is sup-
posed to contribute to the legitimate formation of a singular name at least seems to
be targeted at a serious logical problem. For this prescription is supposed to exclude
at once the cases in which the quantifier rules become invalid. These are precisely
Frege himself set store by the declaration, “[I]t is only in the context of a proposition that
words have any meaning.” Frege 1986/1950, § 62. This declaration tends to be called Frege’s ‘con-
text principle’.
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 35
119

the cases in which two expression of the form Φ (a) and ~ Φ (a) are both false. I
would like now to ask whether this prescription is genuinely reasonable. In particu-
lar, it should be asked whether it is really necessary to follow Frege in abandoning
the universal validity of the bivalence principle.
This abandonment as such already causes difficulties. Above, in § 8, I had intro-
duced the bivalence principle as a strictly universally valid semantic principle. Thus,
its universal validity depends merely on fixing the meaning of the word ‘false’. Truth
can be explained by means of a mere nominal definition as the correspondence of a
proposition with the object or objects it deals with. According to the semantic biva-
lence principle, falsity consists in the respective non-correspondence. Now if one
abandons the universal validity and the semantic character of the bivalence princi-
ple, then one burdens oneself with the semantic problem of having to give a new
explanation for the truth and falsity of a proposition, and especially to explain what
it means to say of a proposition which does not correspond to the object it is about
that it is not false.
Without doubt, one should be prepared to take on this semantic problem if it
appeared compellingly necessary to reject the bivalence principle as a universally
valid semantic principle. But of this there can be no question at all.
For to sustain the validity of the quantifier rules, it is not necessary to abandon
the bivalence principle. Rather it is enough to be aware of a condition on which the
use of the language of the calculus of functions depends, namely, that the principle
of the affirmative use of double negation is valid. For whether two propositions of
the form A and ~ A are contradictory, so that there is no ‘third’ apart from A and
~ A, and not both A as well as ~ A can be false, does by no means depend on an
implicit presupposition only in cases where A is a singular proposition.
Rather, this presupposition is also in play with universal and particular proposi-
tions. Pairs of propositions related as ‘(∃v) Φ (v)’ and ‘~ (∃v) Φ (v)’ are contradictory
propositions only if there are elements of the domain to which the bound variable ‘v’
tacitly refers. According to the principle of qualitative existential import, (affirma-
tive) propositions of the form A ((′v) Φ (v), ξ) and I ((′v) Φ (v), ξ), for which ‘(∀v) Φ (v)’
and ‘(∃v) Φ (v)’ are only translations, are true only if the concept ξ is satisfied. Like-
wise, the truth-functional negations of propositions of the form (∀v) Φ (v) and (∃v)
Φ (v) assume a non-empty domain. This is due to the way the quantifiers are used.
According to the rules of the strong logical square, the expressions ‘~ (∀v) Φ (v)’ and
‘~ (∃v) Φ (v)’ correspond initially only to the expressions ‘E ((′v) Φ (v), ξ)’ and ‘O ((′v)
Φ (v), ξ)’, and the latter (as non-truth-functional expressions) in no way assume that
the concept ξ is a non-empty concept. (For according to the principle of qualitative
existential import, ‘E ((′v) Φ (v), ξ)’ and ‘O ((′v) Φ (v), ξ)’ are to be understood as imply-
ing neither an affirmative nor a limitative proposition. Nor, then, do they entail an
existential proposition in some indirect way.) But the quantifier ‘(∃v) . . .’ is used as
120
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

an abbreviation of ‘~ (∀v) ~ . . .’. Even Frege, who entirely dispensed with the use
of an existential quantifier, explains in § 12 of the Begriffsschrift that the expression
‘~ (∀v) Φ (v)’ means “that we could find some object, say Δ, such that Φ (Δ) would be
denied. We can therefore translate it as ‘There are some objects which do not have
the property Φ’” (Frege 1879, 23, § 12 [1967, 27]). Quite in accord with this, ‘(∀v) ~ Φ (v)’
means that “There does not exist anything having property Φ” (Frege 1879, 23, § 12
[1967, 27]). Here it is almost stipulated purely by definition first that ‘~ (∀v) Φ (v)’
is equivalent to ‘(∃v) ~ Φ (v)’ and second that ‘~ (∃v) Φ (v)’ is equivalent to ‘(∀v) ~
Φ (v)’. In this way, however, it is just stipulated not only that ‘(∀v) Φ (v)’ and ‘(∃v)
Φ (v)’ but also their truth-functional negations have existential implications;
namely, they implicitly assume that the domains to which they refer are not
empty, so that there is at least one object that falls under the concept ξ.
That is: if A is a quantified formula, there is no interpretation in which A or
~ A is a true or false proposition unless the domain given with A is not empty.
The validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation is clearly
paired in these cases with the assumption that the domain implicitly given with
the quantified formulas is non-empty.
Now the language the calculus of functions involves the same pairing for singu-
lar propositions as well: if A is a formula which contains an individual constant ‘a’,
then there is no interpretation in which A or ~ A is a true or false proposition unless
a is an element of the given non-empty domain. Frege’s supposition that a must
exist if F (a) and ~ F (a) stand in a contradictory relationship is thus entirely correct.
But it is not at all necessary to deny the validity of the bivalence principle. It is rather
enough to suppose that the validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double
negation for pairs of propositions of the form A and ~ A is universally tied to the
assumption that all individual signs (including individual constants) refer to ele-
ments of non-empty domains. In the language of the calculus of functions, individual
constants are used in such a way that they are always equivalent to singular names
of the form ‘that ζ’. Here, ζ is either the same concept as ξ or not the same, and if not
the same, then it is a sub-concept of ξ. Every object that falls under ζ, is thus to be
regarded as an object which, whatever content ζ has, falls under the concept ξ. That
is, every object discussed is regarded as an object which falls under the concept ob-
ject that is an element of the given domain. Along with the supposition that the do-
main is not empty, it is directly supposed here that all individual constants are
singular names which use a concept in their formation which is either the concept ξ
or is subordinated to it.
It is for this reason surely correct that a concept used to form a singular name
must satisfy the condition of not being empty, so that a consistent use of the truth-
functional negation sign is assured. However, within formal-language contexts no spe-
cial provisions need to be made to satisfy this condition. It is enough to assume what
2 Examination of the Translation Program § 35
121

must be assumed in the calculus of functions anyway: that the domain to which any
designation for individuals refers is not empty; it is indifferent here whether such a
designation is a bound variable or an individual constant.
It can be seen here that there is no reasonable ground for calling into ques-
tion the validity of the bivalence principle. It is enough rather to suppose (what I
have already supposed anyway) that the principle of the affirmative use of double
negation is not valid for every kind of negation. So far as its validity is connected
to the exclusive use of the language of the calculus of functions, especially to the
use of ‘~ . . .’, its validity (and precisely therewith the consistent use of the lan-
guage of the calculus of functions as well) depends on the implicit assumption of
non-empty domains. In other words, the validity of this principle and the use of
this language depends on the implicit supposition that certain concepts, specifi-
cally the concepts ξ and ζ, are singled out as non-empty concepts. –
This may be the place for a short excursus on Bertrand Russell’s attempt to read the
form Φ (a) as merely the apparent, surface form of singular propositions and, by
reducing this form to a more complex form, to defend against Frege the universal
validity of the bivalence principle.
This attempt is based on the introduction of the iota operator. Russell’s analy-
sis of propositions of the form Φ (a), put briefly, consisted in making explicit the
conceptual (or descriptive) content of ‘a’ – insofar as there is such.133 He thus in-
terpreted ‘a’ as abbreviating a functional expression of the form ‘(ι x) G (x)’ (read:
‘that x for which G (x) holds’). In this interpretation, ‘(ι x) G (x)’ involves the sup-
position that there is exactly one object x to which G (x) applies; symbolically ex-
pressed: (∃x) G (x) & (∀x) (∀y) ((G (x) & G (y)) ⊃(x = y)). ‘(ι x) G (x)’ stands for this
expression as an abbreviation, so that ‘F (a)’ is equivalent to ‘(ι x) G (x) & F (x))’
(read: ‘There is exactly one x for which G (x) and F (x) hold’).
In this analysis, the bivalence principle remains in effect, since, in case the
concept contained in ‘G (x)’ is empty, – in case there thus is no bearer for ‘a’ –
both ‘(ι x) G (x) & F (x))’ as well as ‘(ι x) G (x) & ~ F (x))’ have a truth value, namely,
F. Hence, in this analysis ‘F (a)’ and ‘~ F (a)’ can both be false. Both the singular
propositions ‘the king of France reigning in 1905 is bald’ and ‘the king of France
reigning in 1905 is not bald’ are, if there is no reigning king of France in 1905,
both false, since they are not in Russell’s analysis related as ‘p’ and ‘~ p’, but
rather as two complex propositions, where the first component in both is the
Russell distinguished cases in which ‘a’ has a descriptive content from cases in which ‘a’ stands
for a ‘logically proper name’. He supposed – unjustifiably of course – that such proper names, includ-
ing demonstratives like ‘this’ as they refer to sense-data, cannot fail in any case to refer to exactly
one object.
122
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

same false existential proposition (‘There is exactly one x such that x is a king of
France reigning in 1905’) and the second component is the open proposition ‘x is
bald’ and the open proposition ‘x is not bald’, respectively.
Russell’s analysis and the connected theory of definite descriptions – as he
designated expressions of the form (ι x) Ψ (x) – has not found many supporters, but
it has provoked a flood of ambitious reactions in the philosophy of language. Some,
like Strawson, were not inclined to recognize the bivalence principle and preferred
to accept as logically relevant the ordinary usage of the words ‘true’ and ‘false’,
where this principle does not hold, or at least not always.134 Others took exception
to the assumption that ordinary proper names are connected to a descriptive mean-
ing and that their “reference” depends on this connectedness.
Concerning the descriptive meaning and the reference of proper names, Russell’s
theory certainly contains – at least as Saul A. Kripke understood it135 – the assailable
supposition that ordinary and correctly used proper names are always abbreviated
or disguised individual identifiers. According to this supposition, ‘Scott’ and ‘the au-
thor of Waverly’, e.g., are used as synonyms, so that ‘the author of Waverly’ is equiva-
lent to ‘Scott’ and a proposition like ‘Scott is the author of Waverly’ would be
understood as an analytically true proposition – which is not very plausible.
To avoid this consequence, several loopholes have been considered. Among
them, the following three have become the most well-known: (1) the ‘bundle theory’,
according to which proper names have descriptive meanings, but which only can
be rendered by a bundle of individual identifiers, among which most or at least the
most important apply to bearer of the name; (2) the ‘causal theory’, according to
which there is no descriptive meaning of proper names, and their significance de-
pends merely on a baptism which establishes their reference and on which all nam-
ing (passed down in a chain of communication) of the name’s bearer causally
depends; (3) the ‘use theory’, according to which proper names have meaning, not
in the sense of descriptive meaning, but rather in the sense of a certain use or habit
in which the name points to individual identifiers of the name’s bearer. In none of
these theories is it systematically considered that (a) any reference of proper names
and individual identifiers only occurs in propositions (a salutation, too, is a proposi-
tion, namely a proposition of request or invitation), that (b) in declarative proposi-
tions there is a bipartite expression corresponding to every proper name and every
individual identifier, where the first part expresses a term, while the other part ex-
presses the logical form of the declarative proposition, here its singularity, and that

(c) it is the logical form which establishes the reference, first of the proposition it-
self, but then indirectly of all the expressions occurring in it as well.
It would bring us too far afield to follow up on the loopholes just described. It
may instead suffice to recall once again the starting point of all these attempts,
namely, the task of Russell’s theory of definite descriptions to defend the bivalence
principle by reducing the forms Φ (a) and ~ Φ (a) to forms which do not relate as A
and ~ A. This theory, just like those of its critics, rested on the assumption that the
form of truth-functional negation is the only form of negation. That is, Russell and his
critics did not see that there is no need to interpret pairs of singular propositions from
ordinary language which relate as ‘p’ and ‘not p’ as if their surface form were ‘p’ and
‘~ p’. When interpreted according to the latter form, they are coupled first to the valid-
ity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation and second to the as-
sumption that the singular names occurring in them always have existing bearers.136
Now if, with Russell and in contrast to Frege, one wants to let the bivalence princi-
ple hold unrestrictedly, without having to make use of auxiliary assumptions from
the philosophy of language or logic about the reference and meaning of singular
names, then, according to the analysis of singular propositions I have carried out
above, the following consequences result, which are of interest both with respect to
logic and the philosophy of language:
First, all reasons fall away for maintaining Frege’s view that the falling of an object
under a concept is the basic logical relation to which all relations of concepts to con-
cepts can be reduced. Rather, all affirmative propositions have equally to do – even
if not manifest in the same way – with subsuming objects under concepts just as
they have to do with relating concepts to other concepts.
Second, the view that it is possible to translate at least in part the elementary
syllogistic language into the language of the calculus of functions should be aban-
doned; on the contrary, it should rather be recognized that the language of the
calculus of functions can be translated into a language that dispenses with a truth-
functional vocabulary and does not differ at all from the elementary syllogistic lan-
guage,137 or only by making use of elementary conjunction and using expressions of
the form (′v) Φ (v) instead of concept variables.
Finally, third, it should be recognized that the use of the logical vocabulary of
the calculus of functions is tied to specific suppositions or assumptions which are not
needed for the use of the syllogistic vocabulary. For the truth-functional signs that

are essential for the calculus of functions do not only entail, as I have already shown
in § 30, that the validity of the principle of the affirmative use of double negation and
the validity of the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason are tacitly in effect.
Rather, as has emerged in these paragraphs, the use of this calculus, when it is tied
to the use of quantifiers and individual signs, also entails the invalidity of the princi-
ple of qualitative existential import, so that it is instead assumed that from the nega-
tion of an arbitrary (universal, particular, or singular) statement it follows that there
is something (to which the predicate of the negated statement does not apply) – and
this no matter what the negated statement is about. In other words, the use of quan-
tifiers and individual signs in conjunction with truth-functional signs is tied to the
assumption that there are objects to which individual constants and bound individ-
ual variables refer. I will call this assumption the principle of non-empty domains.
3 Limits of the Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions
§ 36 A Formal Language of Non-Pure Thinking
In the preceding paragraphs, it has turned out that Frege’s thesis that all conceptual
relations are reducible to relations of objects falling under concepts is untenable.
Every expression Φ (t) which presents the relation of an object falling under a con-
cept should be understood rather as the expression of a conceptual relation. More-
over, it has been shown that the language of the calculus of functions can be
completely translated into a formal language whose vocabulary is distinguished
from the elementary language of syllogistic in three ways: first, it contains the pro-
positional connective of elementary conjunction as an additional logical constant;
second, it uses expressions of the form (′v) Φ (v) in place of concept variables; and
finally, third, by using the conceptual constants ξ and ζ, it brings abbreviations for
specific concepts into play.138
Incidentally, the point of view we have arrived at here is distinguished in at least one impor-
tant respect from that which Fred Sommers and his followers of the so-called ‘new syllogistic’ have
adopted. Sommers, too, ties his ‘logic of natural language’ to the pre-Fregean tradition of logical the-
ory, for which it was beyond doubt that propositions of natural language (so far as they are subject
to deductive inference) needed an analysis for logical purposes which is oriented to subject-
predicate (or nominal-verbal phrase) syntax. Noam Chomsky also pays respect to this need with his
generative transformation grammar, according to which ‘a human being’, ‘some human being’, ‘Soc-
rates’, ‘every human being’, and ‘the snowman’ are all expressions which belong to one and the
same substitution class. But the syllogistic system developed by Sommers, which claims to be as ca-
pable as modern (Fregean) quantified logic, is even still a truth-functional system. For this reason,
3 Limits of the Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions § 36
125

This finding requires us to take leave of firmly held convictions concerning
the systematic relationship between the syllogistic and the calculus of functions
(classical predicate logic), which have been ever more widespread as the systems
of syllogistic logic have been displaced, while mathematical logic has been further
established and ramified. Among these convictions belongs not least a view
which has been typical of the Fregean point of view and which has been adopted
(or at least tolerated) by most of his followers without much reservation: namely,
the conviction that the language of the calculus of functions, or what Frege called
a “concept-script,” is something like a “formal language [. . .] of pure thought.”139
It can now be seen relatively easily that this conviction, too, is ultimately unten-
able, if we only consider its content somewhat more closely. Frege was convinced
that his concept-script language would be restricted to “expressing relations that
are independent of the particular characteristics of objects” (Frege 1879, iv [1967, 6]).
Accordingly, by a “purely logical” procedure, he understood one “that disregards
the particular characteristics of objects,” in which “nothing intuitive [may] intrude”
(Frege 1879, iii–iv [1967, 5]).
In his characterization of the “pure logical” and in his talk of the “intuitive” it
becomes clear that Frege takes up conceptions that were characteristic of Kant’s
point of view. Disregarding all particular characteristics of things and omitting all
intuitive content was also from Kant’s perspective an essential mark of pure thinking
and for the purity of what Kant called formal logic (see M. Wolff 2007, 53–70). For
Kant, the syllogistic provided the paradigm of formal logic precisely because it has to
do only with conceptual relations and thus abstracts from all content of concepts
and from all relations to objects.140 This Kantian point of view comports with the
description I gave above in §§ 1–15 of the basic features of the elementary syllogistic.
the objections which Peter F. Strawson (1982) raised against its claim to the title of a ‘logic of natural
language’ are not unjustified, though this does not call into question the capability of this system.

Arithmetic, of Pure Thought.”

M. Wolff 1995, 120–24. In this earlier book, I show that for Kant formal logic is that subdomain of
logic which distinguishes itself by its universality and purity and whose formality consists in ab-
stracting from the “logical material” of judgments, i.e., from the content of the concepts occurring in
them. John MacFarlane (2000) has in his dissertation, What Does it Mean to Say that Logic is Formal,
and in his essay, “Kant, Frege, and the Logic of Logicism” (2002), argued that in Kant’s view the for-
mality of logic is a consequence of its universality. MacFarlane’s view that universal logic is univer-
sal in exactly the same sense from both Kant’s and Frege’s perspective (MacFarlane 2002, 60) is
untenable because Frege does not share Kant’s view that universal and pure logic must, as formal
logic, abstract completely from the logical material of judgments, i.e., from the content of concepts.
126
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

We can see the specifically formal, pure character of the syllogistic precisely in
that its rules concern operations between concepts alone. In their essentials, these
operations (which I have already pointed out in § 1) involve nothing else than the
relating of concepts to concepts, whether in subordinating or coordinating them.141
Accordingly, apart from propositional variables, concept variables are the only varia-
bles in the syllogistic elementary language. The syllogistic is formal and thereby pure
logic precisely in the sense that it neither makes use of conceptual constants nor
takes into consideration other interpretations for concept variables (so that it totally
disregards the content of concepts). It therefore makes use neither of individual vari-
ables nor of individual constants and hence disregards everything intuitive and non-
conceptual, consequently all relations of concepts to objects. The subsuming of objects
under concepts is considered in the syllogistic only insofar as it already belongs to
the logical form of judgments to refer to objects in such and such a way, even if this
comes about only in a totally abstract form.142
Unlike the expressions of the syllogistic, expressions for propositional functions
do not refer to purely logical operations, at least not to purely logical operations in
the sense just described. Though propositional functions can likewise be considered
as operations whose field consists of concepts, yet already their form, which essen-
tially involves being equipped with empty places that are meant for individual vari-
ables, indicates that in propositional functions concepts are given consideration
only to the extent that they refer directly to objects, and not to concepts. Insofar as
individual signs are partly bound variables and partly constants, what is explicitly
given consideration here are partly objects in general (as elements of the given do-
main) and partly objects in particular (as bearers of specific designations or proper
names).143 In this respect, the logic of the calculus of functions is precisely not a
formal logic. Since with concepts like ξ and ζ it implicitly takes specific conceptual
contents into consideration, it is in any case not a formal logic in the precise and
radical sense in which the syllogistic is formal. Nor is the logic of the calculus of
Kant summarizes these operations, accordingly, under the concept of the logical use of the
understanding, the usus logicus intellectus. See CPR A 67/B 92, and the 1771 Dissertation, § 5 (Ak. 2:
393–94).
After what has been said, it may perhaps not be superfluous to declare explicitly that, not
only in singular but also in particular and universal judgments, objects are subsumed under con-
cepts. The grammatical subject of particular or universal propositions, whose standard form can
be portrayed by ‘some α’ and ‘every α’ respectively, like ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’, stands for exactly the object
which is subsumed under a concept by means of these propositions, respectively.
Here I disregard entirely the fact that the calculus of functions also takes characteristics of
objects into consideration insofar as belonging to an n-tupel, (reflexive) self-relation, and other
properties of an object can be determined more precisely by the number and type of the empty
places in a functional expression.

127

functions pure in the precise and radical sense in which syllogistic is pure. Since the
logic of the calculus of functions allows as one of its assumptions that concepts like
ξ and ζ neither have the same content nor are empty, it is neither fitting to say with
Frege that the procedure of the calculus of functions disregards “the particular
characteristics of objects,” nor is it correct to suppose that nothing “intuitive” in-
trudes in this procedure.
As far as disregarding the particular characteristics of things is concerned, it
should not be overlooked that already features like belonging to a definite domain
which is tacitly assumed as non-empty and the property of being the bearer of a
certain name or the bearer of a certain identifier are particular characteristics,
through which objects can be distinguished from each other and which the calcu-
lus of functions does not disregard.
As for the intrusion of intuitive representations, it should not go unnoticed that
already the definite (if also relatively abstract) representation of a non-empty do-
main is an intuitive representation in Kant’s sense. According to Kant’s terminology –
which Frege picks up with his talk of the intuitive – all representations insofar as
they represent something singular are intuitions.144 Whether the singular that is rep-
resented is something spatial, something temporal, something spatio-temporal, or
even something intuitive in a non-sensory way, is a completely secondary question.
The representation of a non-empty domain of individuals is eo ipso the representa-
tion of something singular, namely: the representation of a singular, even if indefi-
nitely large number of singular objects. A given domain is non-empty if and only if it
contains at least one element – however else this singular object may be more pre-
cisely determined. The supposition that there is a definite (even if not more precisely
designated) domain which is non-empty but contains at least one singular element
is – at least according to Kant’s understanding of ‘intuitive’ – intuitive to exactly the
same degree as, e.g., the geometrical supposition that there is a space (namely, a do-
main of spatial objects) which contains points, lines, surfaces, etc., as its elements.
The distinction between the two suppositions does not lie in the first’s being non-
Cf. Hintikka 1992, 23: “According to his [i.e. Kant’s] definition, presented in the first paragraph
of his lectures on logic, every particular idea as distinguished from general concepts is an intuition.
Everything, in other words which in the human mind represents an individual is an intuition.
There is, we may say, nothing ‘intuitive’ about intuitions so defined. Intuitivity simply means indi-
viduality.” Hintikka 1992, 26–27: “If we can assume that the symbols we use in algebra stand for
individual numbers, then it becomes trivially true to say that algebra is based on the use of intu-
itions, i.e., on the use of representations of individuals as distinguished from general concepts.”
128
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

intuitive; it lies only in the fact that this supposition leaves indefinite the kind of intu-
ition that can represent the elements of that domain.145
To be sure, the language of the calculus of functions is able to leave open which
kind of intuition that can represent the singular object that encompasses any given
domain. But already with the assumption that a given domain is not empty, some-
thing intuitive intrudes into the use of this language. In this respect, it cannot be
employed as a language “of pure thought.”
For this reason, the language of the calculus of functions is not correctly de-
scribed when classified as a “formal language of pure thought”, as Frege did. For the
same reason, it is inappropriate to characterize the calculus of functions as a ‘pure
logic’.
§ 37 Reference to Intuition and Symbolic Construction
Instead of speaking of pure thought in this connection, it would be more appro-
priate, if we wanted to maintain Kant’s terminology, to speak of a language of
symbolic construction. I would like to explain this idea somewhat more precisely.
Kant uses ‘construction’ to name the relating, especially the subsuming, of par-
ticular objects or particular intuitions under concepts. He also designates this relat-
ing as a ‘presenting’ of concepts ‘in’ intuitions. Kant uses ‘symbolic’ to name such a
construction when substitutive symbols (or ‘characters’, i.e., signs) are put in place
of particular intuitions in which a concept is supposed to be presented. These sym-
bols leave it totally indefinite what type (or types) of intuition the presentation can
occur in. We have such substitutes in, e.g., analytic geometry. There letters take the
place of spatial objects like line-segments. With this kind of substitute, it remains
completely indefinite what kind of (pure or empirical) intuition it is that represents
those objects to which the substitutive signs can be related.146
Kant related the designation ‘symbolic construction’ specifically to algebraic op-
erations as they occur in analytic geometry and elsewhere. A letter like ‘a’ in ‘a3 = 8’
admits various interpretations: it is interpretable as a line-segment, as a unit of time,
as a section which can be plotted both on an abscissa and on a coordinate, etc.; in
According to § 2 of the Critique of Pure Reason, everything which determines “inner sense” is
the content of inner intuition. Accordingly, even (e.g.) thoughts, insofar as they are enumerable in a
series, – thus insofar as they can ‘affect’ inner sense in a series – are of course something intuitive.
Even a numeric formula like ‘7 + 5 = 12’ can be regarded as a symbolic construction in Kant’s
sense. Here numerals are the symbols which stand as substitutes for intuitive magnitudes. They
stand for magnitudes of a number of empirical objects, magnitudes of spatial extensions, magni-
tudes of time periods, etc.
3 Limits of the Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions § 37
129

this way, ‘a’ admits intuitive interpretations of various kinds. But the symbolic con-
struction of a concept concerns none of these specific interpretations. In the formula
‘a3 = 8’ only the abstract concept of the cube root of eight is constructed. With ‘a3 = b’
it can be replaced by the still more abstract concept of the cube root of b. Once such
a concept is constructed, we can pose algebraic problems, e.g., the problem of finding
out what a, the square of a, the quintuple of a, etc. are identical to. A specific domain
can, but need not, be assumed with such problems, e.g., the domain of the natural
numbers. The solution to such problems can be presented as a chain of informal
conclusions, as in the following manner:
a3 = 8
a = 2
a2 = 4
⋮
With each conclusion here, there is always only an inference from one symbolic
construction to another. There are, however, also logical operations within alge-
bra by which algebraic laws are inferred. Inferences drawn from symbolic con-
structions can form the basis of these operations, which occur according to the
rule of complete induction. Since a2 = 4 follows from a3 = 8, a hypothetical and
thus also subjunctive proposition of the same content as the first premise of the
inference of the form
F (a)
F (n) ⊃F (n + 1)
F (n)
can be formulated, so that the following results:
(a3 = 8) ⊃(a2 = 4)
((n3 = 8) ⊃(n2 = 4)) ⊃(((n + 1)3 = 8) ⊃((n + 1)2 = 4 ))
(n3 = 8) ⊃(n2 = 4).
The letter ‘n’ is used here, as is still generally standard in the older algebra, as a
substitute for an arbitrary natural number, and indeed so that ‘n’ is equivalent to
‘(∀x) . . . x . . .’, with x ∈ℕ, where all occurrences of x in each line lie within the
scope of the universal quantifier. In this way, the conclusion comes to express an
algebraic law valid for all natural numbers.
The inference just described also remains valid if an arbitrary non-empty do-
main is assumed and if both the second premise as well as the conclusion are
130
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

explicitly tied to the instruction that n is an element from the set of natural num-
bers. The inference then says:
(a3 = 8) ⊃(a2 = 4)
(∀n) (((n3 = 8) ⊃(n2 = 4)) ⊃(((n + 1)3 = 8) ⊃((n + 1)2 = 4)))
(∀n) (n ∈ℕ⊃((n3 = 8) ⊃(n2 = 4)).
‘(∀n) . . . n . . .’ does not only refer to all natural numbers. Rather, an arbitrary
individual variable may be put in place of ‘n’, so that the conclusion of the infer-
ence is a statement of a law in which ‘n’ refers to “everything thinkable” (cf. Frege
1990, 103 [1984, 112]).
Although the inference just described refers, with its universally quantified
propositions, to everything thinkable, it still deals with something intuitive. For
even if thinking and intuiting are opposed activities, with the mention of the
thinkable in the present context something intuitive is meant. Something think-
able, as an element of a non-empty domain, is some singular individual, however
else it may be more precisely determined; to the extent that this individual re-
mains completely indeterminate, it is represented as something that, though it
can be subsumed under concepts, is not yet determined by a concept. To that ex-
tent, it is not conceptually represented but is rather without conceptual mediation.
Such a representation of something singular that takes place without conceptual
mediation is precisely what Kant calls an intuition.147
Hence, algebraic inferences (provided they proceed according to the rule of
complete induction like the inference just described) consist of propositions
which refer essentially to intuition or something intuitive; and this reference can
take place because of the way these propositions make use of a language of sym-
bolic construction.
Frege correctly saw that one basically does not leave the sphere of algebra or
the sphere of arithmetic if one advances from algebraic inferences like those I have
just described to the rules according to which these inferences are made. In any
case, one still remains entirely within the sphere of algebra if in the propositions of
the last inference above one puts abbreviating expressions like ‘F (x)’ and ‘G (x)’ in
place of the equations ‘n2 = 4’ and ‘n3 = 8’. Nor does anything change in essentials
when, in addition, function variables are put in place of function constants and
more general expressions replace specific propositional connectives, so that for ex-
ample ‘F (x) ⊃G (x)’ is replaced by ‘Φ (x)’. We then obtain (through a corresponding
transformation of the mode of inference described above with a = 0) the schema
for a universal rule, namely, the schema for the rule of complete induction:
See above in § 36, especially p. 190 and note 144.

Φ (0)
(∀x) (Φ (x) ⊃Φ (x + 1))
(∀x) (x ∈ℕ⊃Φ (x)).
However, with the sign for zero, with ‘x + 1’, and with ‘x ∈ℕ’ included, a specifi-
cally arithmetical vocabulary is still in play, with which the given domain is re-
stricted to the domain of the natural numbers.
It was Frege’s great discovery that the concepts whose symbolic constructions
we can view as ‘x + 1’ and ‘x ∈ℕ’ can be defined almost exclusively with expres-
sions that belong to the vocabulary of the calculus of functions.148 The concept
which is symbolically constructed with ‘a = b + 1’, is the predicate concept in ‘a is
the successor of b in the series beginning with zero’. Frege could show of this con-
cept that it is the sub-concept of a more abstract concept which no longer makes
reference to the number zero. This concept is the predicate concept in the expres-
sion ‘b bequeaths the property (′x) Φ (x) to a in the ψ-series’, and this expression
can, by means of a definition, be completely rendered in the language of the cal-
culus of functions. Finally, as for the concept which is symbolically constructed
with ‘a ∈ℕ’, it corresponds to the logical predicate in the expression ‘a equals
zero or follows the successor of zero in the series beginning with zero’. And Frege
could also show of this concept that it is a sub-concept of a more abstract concept
which can likewise, by means of a definition, be rendered entirely in the language
of the concept-script, so that there is no longer any mention of zero in it either.
This concept corresponds to the logical predicate in ‘a follows b in the ψ-series’. It
was one of Frege’s main aims in his Begriffsschrift to show that the inference
schema of complete induction introduced above is valid because a still more ab-
stract inference schema is valid, namely, the schema:
Φ (x)
Φ is hereditary in the Ψ-series from x to y
[y follows x in the Ψ-series] ⊃Φ (y).
Frege could show that schema can be rendered entirely in the language of the
calculus of functions.149

Frege correctly concluded from his discovery that there is not a very great
difference between the mathematical rule of complete induction and the compar-
atively more general rule of inference in the concept-script. The difference be-
tween them can be reduced in its essentials to the fact that to formulate the
inference rule purely in the concept-script one needs neither an algebraic sign
(like the sign for zero) nor the identity sign (‘. . . = . . .’). For this reason, Frege
believed that arithmetic and logic are ultimately the same.150 ‘Logic’ meant here
the logic of the calculus of functions, and to the extent that only this logic was
meant, it is difficult to see what convincing objection would speak against Frege’s
conclusion.
However, mathematical and pure logic – the logic of the calculus of functions
and the syllogistic – can be clearly distinguished from each other. What Frege did
not notice is first the fact that expressions of the type ‘b bequeaths the property (′x)
Φ (x) to a in the ψ-series’ and ‘a follows b in the ψ-series’ involve concepts being
symbolically constructed in intuition, just as ‘x + 1’ and ‘x ∈ℕ’ do. Thus, he could
take the language in which they are formulable as a language of pure (i.e., abstract-
ing entirely from intuition) thought. Second, Frege was erroneously convinced that
the rules of the syllogistic can be reduced to the rules of the calculus of functions.
He believed syllogistic propositional schemata could be rendered in the language of
the calculus of functions. He could therefore suppose that the validity of syllogistic
rules were provable within the logical system of the Begriffsschrift (see Frege 1879,
9–10, § 6 [1967, 17]).
§ 38 The Problem of Synthetic Propositions A Priori in Arithmetic
The founding father of the logical analysis of language did not base his conviction
that the calculus of functions belongs to or coincides with the sphere of what
Kant called ‘pure logic’ on an analysis of the languages which are utilized within
logic. Instead, what was decisive for his conviction was the speculative, philo-
sophical aim of casting doubt on Kant’s view of the synthetic character of arith-
metic. To achieve this aim, Frege had to assume that no suppositions that depend
on intuition are tied to the use of the calculus of functions, that this language is
rather a formal language of pure thought – an assumption which cannot stand, as
I established in §§ 36–37.
I here set aside the fact that Frege in The Foundations of Arithmetic went a step further still
when he wanted to show there that even numeric concepts like the concept of zero and the con-
cept of the successor of zero can be defined in a language of the calculus of functions which is
only marginally extended.
3 Limits of the Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions § 38
133

The speculative, philosophical aim Frege pursued was already clearly ex-
pressed in his Begriffsschrift and indeed in the context of the “General Theory of
Sequences,” which is developed in the third part of that work. In this part, the prin-
ciple of complete induction is supposed to be derived from the basic formulas of
the logical system of the Begriffsschrift. Frege explicitly assumes that the above-
mentioned definition (from § 37), which he establishes in this part of the Begriffss-
chrift, is not a synthetic judgment; and Frege does not fail to add immediately here:
I point this out because Kant considers all judgments of mathematics to be synthetic. (Frege
1879, 56, § 24 [1967, 55])
Frege thus seems to assume of the basic formulas of his logical system that their
universal validity follows from the mere meaning of the logical constants that ap-
pear in them;151 they are consequently analytically true expressions.
As Frege already says in the Preface to the Begriffsschrift, it was his main aim
to demonstrate that arithmetical judgments can be proven “purely by means of
logic” (Frege 1879, iii [1967, 5]) and indeed “by means of inference alone”, without
reliance on intuition, but “with the sole support of those laws of thought which
transcend all particulars” (Frege 1879, iv [1967, 5]). With the derivation of the prin-
ciple of complete induction, which is fundamental for arithmetic, it is supposed to
be shown “how pure thought, irrespective of any content given by the senses or
even by an intuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results from its
own constitution, bring forth judgments that at first sight appear to be possible
only on the basis of some intuition” (Frege 1879, 55, § 23 [1967, 55]).
To dispel at once the astonishment that “pure logic” and “pure thought” are
in a position to “bring forth judgments that at first sight appear to be possible
only on the basis of some intuition,” Frege compares – not without pride – the
success of his undertaking with a progress in the experimental science of nature.
He says this result
can be compared with condensation, through which it is possible to transform the air that
to a child’s consciousness appears as nothing into a visible fluid that forms drops. (Frege
1879, 55, § 23 [1967, 55])
The scientific “consciousness” to which the process of condensation appears not as
creatio ex nihilo but rather a mere transformation of available materials, should, if
Frege is correct, also be prepared to regard the derivation of the generalized princi-
ple of induction as a mere transformation of a content, which is already given with
For example, Frege traces the validity of the basic formula A ⊃(B ⊃A) in § 14 of the Be-
griffsschrift immediately back to the meaning of ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ explained in § 5.
134
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

the basic formulas and definitions from which the derivation follows.152 To provide
the demonstration that “arithmetical modes of inference” have “a purely logical na-
ture” (Frege 1990, 103 [1984, 112]) and do not already implicitly make use of synthetic
propositions, Frege would thus have had to demonstrate that among the basic as-
sumptions from which they are derivable, no synthetic assumptions can be found.
But such a demonstration, as far as I know, he did not carry out.
At the end of § 35 I had already pointed out in summary that three basic as-
sumptions are connected to the use of the language of the calculus of functions,
none of which is beyond suspicion of being a non-analytic, synthetic assumption.
They are the following three basic assumptions:
–
first, the principle of the affirmative use of double negation,
–
second, the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason,
–
third, the principle of non-empty domains.
At this point, it is not clear, even in outline, how it could really be denied that
these basic assumptions are synthetic.
4 The Vocabulary of the Universal Language
of Deductive Logic
§ 39 Non-Syllogistic Basic Rules in the Language of Syllogistic
The foregoing analysis of logical languages has shown that the language of the
syllogistic can be suitably translated neither into the language of the calculus of
classes nor into the language of the calculus of functions without loss. Conversely,
however, the language of the calculus of functions – and a fortiori the language of
the calculus of classes as well – can be thoroughly translated into a language that
is distinguished from the language of syllogistic only in that it makes use of ele-
mentary conjunction and uses instead of concept variables expressions of the
form (′v) Φ (v).153
On the question of what it means that the Begriffsschrift claims to derive the generalized
principle of mathematical induction, see M. Wolff 2000, 87–96.
For this reason, it would not be correct to suppose that inferences involving many-place
propositional functions (i.e., inferences like the example I gave at the end of § 24 [see above
p. 69]) could not be presented and proved in their validity in the language of the syllogistic. On
this, see the examples of rules which are treated below (in §§ 66 and 76).
4 The Vocabulary of the Universal Language of Deductive Logic § 39
135

Now the supposition that the language of the calculus of functions is ‘reduc-
ible’ to a non-truth-functional formal language154 should not be misunderstood,
however. It does not mean that it would be possible to reduce the validity of the
logical rules and laws of the calculus of functions completely to the validity of
principles which hold within the syllogistic or within a non-truth-functional logic.
Rather, the use of the language of the calculus of functions is tied to principles
which are not (or at least not without further ado) valid within the syllogistic or a
non-truth-functional logic. Among these principles are the three basic principles
recounted at the end of §§ 35 and 38, namely:
–
the principle of the affirmative use of double negation,
–
the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason, and
–
the principle of non-empty domains.
I have still not shown how the syllogistic can be presented as a system of rules
which makes no use of these three basic principles. This presentation will require
setting up an effective system of the rules characteristic of the syllogistic and then
tracing them back to principles whose validity consists exclusively in the meaning
of the logical vocabulary used within the rules, i.e., to principles which do not in-
clude those three just enumerated. This presentation belongs among the tasks of
Part II of this essay. Yet one may already expect this much: even if the three basic
principles just enumerated do not belong among the principles to which the rules
of the syllogistic can be traced back, i.e., even if these three basic principles have
no validity within the syllogistic, this does not mean that these basic rules are not
completely formulable in the syllogistic language. Rather, this language proves to
be the universal language of deductive logic.
Concerning the principle of the affirmative use of double negation, I had al-
ready said in § 10 that it assumes that the double elementary negation of A is
equivalent to A. It says thus that not only rules which correspond to the schema
A
NN A
Since the non-truth-functional language of the syllogistic can also be considered a non-
extensional language, the result that the truth-functional language of the calculus of functions is
reducible to it is opposed to the extensionalism temporarily advocated by Rudolf Carnap and
other philosophers.
136
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

are valid (for purely logical reasons, namely due to the meaning of ‘N A’), but also
rules which correspond to the converse schema (duplex negatio affirmat), i.e., the
schema
NN A
A.
I will in what follows call the prescription to consider as valid rules that follow
this schema the postulate of the affirmative use of double negation.
It is also possible to give the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason (intro-
duced in § 30) the shape of an inference schema without having to make use of
non-syllogistic vocabulary. This schema is:
A
B
A,
for an inference of this form is valid if and only if a proposition of the form H (A,
H (B, A)) or a proposition of the form H ((A, B), A) is true. In what follows, I will
designate the prescription to consider rules as valid if they correspond to this
schema the postulate of the arbitrary sufficient reason.
Finally, the principle of non-empty domains, introduced at the end of § 35,
i.e., the supposition that there are objects which are elements of the domain to
which a saturated propositional function refers, can also be rendered in the syllo-
gistic language. Since this supposition in particular assumes that negations of uni-
versally affirmative propositions always have existential implications (see § 35), it
can be represented as the prescription to consider both the following schemata
valid:
N A (α, β)
and
N A (Nα, β)
I (Nα, β)
I (α, β).
If we replace ‘α’ here with ‘(′v) Φ (v)’, then we get these schemata:
N A ((‘v) Φ (v), β)
and
N A ((‘v) N Φ (v), β)
I ((‘v) N Φ (v), β)
I ((‘v) Φ (v), β).
4 The Vocabulary of the Universal Language of Deductive Logic § 39
137

If we further replace ‘β’ with the conceptual constant ‘ξ’, then the two schemata
turn into expressions of consequence rules which differ from quantifier rules only
in that elementary negation appears in them instead of truth-functional negation.
They correspond to the following schemata:
N (∀v) Φ (v)
and
N (∀v) N Φ (v)
(∃v) N Φ (v).
(∃v) Φ (v).
The equation of ‘~ (∀v) Φ (v)’ and ‘(∃v) ~ Φ (v)’ mentioned in § 35, which is funda-
mental for the use of quantifier rules, assumes the validity of both of these conse-
quence schemata. I will designate the prescription to consider as valid the rules
which are at the basis of these schemata, which can be formulated in the language
of the elementary syllogistic, the postulate of non-empty domains. Clearly, this pos-
tulate annuls the principle of qualitative existential import, which is valid in the
syllogistic. For as a prescription it ensures that negations, whether they are nega-
tions of universal, particular, or singular propositions, are bound to an existence
assumption for the objects they treat. For negations of singular or particular propo-
sitions each imply the negation of a universal proposition with the same conceptual
content. This principle thus guarantees that the concepts for which the variables α
and β stand are not empty.
I speak of mere postulates with respect to the three principles mentioned
here because they are principles whose validity does not depend on the meaning
of the logical constants that are needed for their formulation. Precisely in this are
these postulates distinguished from other principles of deductive logic (as will be
shown still more clearly in Part II of this essay).
If we transform (through conditionalization155) the three postulates (formu-
lated as schemata of rules) into schemata of hypothetical propositions, then, for
every interpretation in which a true or false proposition is formed from any of
these schemata, we get laws whose validity is assumed by the rules and laws of
the calculus of functions and which to that extent can be regarded as logical laws.
But these are not at all laws which are true or valid on purely logical grounds.
Thus, with the principle of the affirmative use of double negation it is assumed
that ‘H (NN A, A)’ is a valid schema of a law. But that a proposition of the form H
(NN A, A) is true depends not at all on logical, but at best on grounds pertaining
The transformation (of the schema) of a consequence rule into a hypothetical expression is
permitted because every hypothetical proposition basically only states that a rule is valid accord-
ing to which its consequent follows from its antecedent. On this and on the rules of transforma-
tion through conditionalization, see §§ 48 and 50.
138
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

to its content. The negation of such a proposition would not necessarily entail a
contradiction or some other kind of inconsistency.
To the principle of the arbitrary sufficient reason correspond propositions of
the form H ((A, B), A) or propositions of the form H (A, H (B, A)).156 Such proposi-
tions cannot be assumed to be true on purely logical grounds either. The truth of
propositions of such a form is based on supposing not only that (A, B) but also
that A follows from a pair of premises A and B. Now this supposition of course
entails that the truth of an arbitrary proposition of the form H (B, A) follows from
A. But here again no contradiction or some other kind of inconsistency results
from denying that a proposition of the form H (B, A) follows from a proposition of
the form A. It would thus be mistaken to think that ‘H ((A, B), A)’ and ‘H (A, H (B,
A))’ are schemata for laws which are valid on purely logical grounds.
Finally, the principle of non-empty domains does not yield a universally valid
schema for a law either. To this principle correspond both the schemata ‘H (N A
(α, β), I (Nα, β))’ and ‘H (N A (Nα, β), I (α, β))’. That propositions corresponding to
these schemata are not necessarily true on purely logical grounds can be seen al-
ready from the fact that the existence of objects is not something which could
have a purely logical ground. Nothing contradictory or inconsistent follows from
assuming an empty domain.
Because none of these three principles is valid on the basis of experience, and
yet each can be negated without contradiction, they may be called non-analytic (or
synthetic) principles a priori. If one presupposes their validity and postulates the
validity of rules of inference which correspond to them in the way indicated, then
the syllogistic signs ‘N . . .’ and ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ take on a truth-functional meaning and
the rules of the logical square turn into rules of the quantifier usage.
The following Part II will show, first, that the syllogistic, as it is understood in
this essay, is completely independent of the assumption that one of the three prin-
ciples just mentioned is valid. Secondly, it will show that the logical calculus of
functions can be derived from basic assumptions of the syllogistic only by means
of these three principles.
§ 40 The Dispensability of an Expression for Logical Conjunction in the
Elementary Language of Syllogistic
I have shown in the last paragraphs that the use of the language of the calculus of
functions is tied to the recognition of three non-syllogistic principles. It will be the
We have seen these already above in § 30.
4 The Vocabulary of the Universal Language of Deductive Logic § 40
139

task of Part II of this essay to display how the rules and laws of the calculus of
functions assume the validity of these three principles. I will show in Part II that,
besides these three principles, the structure of the calculus of functions need only
assume as valid those principles which the syllogistic assumes as valid.
Precisely which principles must be counted as belonging to the syllogistic de-
pends of course on the language which is definitively set apart as the language of
the syllogistic. Conceptual constants will certainly not be needed in this language,
since the syllogistic is distinguished in its formal character from the calculus of
functions by abstracting completely from conceptual contents, so that its language
contains only (apart from propositional variables) conceptual variables.
But the question arises: can we get by in this language with the logical con-
stants which according to § 15 belong to the elementary language of the syllogis-
tic, or do we need to extend this language with the logical constant of elementary
conjunction introduced in § 30?
If we do without elementary conjunction in this language, we will get a system
of rules which, as shown below, has a similarity with (or coincides with) the Aristote-
lian syllogistic; otherwise, we get a system of rules that contains an element of the
Stoic syllogistic. The Aristotelian variant can only result if it is possible to reduce all
expressions in which elementary conjunction occurs to equivalent syllogistic expres-
sions in which elementary conjunction does not occur. In order to establish whether
such a reduction is possible, the following facts must be made clear.
The elementary conjunction of A and B is defined to be equivalent to the pair
premises consisting of A and B (see § 30 above). An inference of the form
A
B
(A, B)
is thus universally valid. According to the rule of reductio ad absurdum this mode
of inference can be converted into this one:
N (A, B)
A
N B.
The first of these two modes of inference merely says that any premise of the
form (A, B) can be replaced by a pair of premises A and B. Expressions of the
form (A, B) are therefore dispensable as expressions for premises. By contrast,
the second of these modes of inference was regarded by Chrysippus and other
140
Part I Section Three The Language of the Logical Calculus of Functions

representatives of Stoic logic as a mode in which the premise expression is not
replaceable by other expressions. Yet Chrysippus and other Stoics did not clearly
distinguish between a truth-functional and non-truth-functional negation. The
Greek Aristotle-commentator Alexander of Aphrodisias rejected the Stoic view
that the expression N (A, B) is logically indispensable. He claimed that a negated
conjunctive statement consisting of two sub-statements p and q is equivalent to a
hypothetical statement whose antecedent is p and whose consequent is the nega-
tion of q.157 Galen held a similar view as well.158
In fact, propositions of the form N (A, B) and H (A, N B) are interchangeable
because of two things: first, a proposition of the form H (A, N B) follows logically
from a proposition of the form N (A, B); and, second, conversely a proposition of the
form N (A, B) follows logically from a proposition of the form H (A, N B).
We can see that a proposition of the form H (A, N B) follows logically from N
(A, B) by recognizing a principle which was also recognized by the representa-
tives of Stoic logic.159 I call this principle (which corresponds to rule (II. 1), which
will be presented below in § 48) the conditionalization principle. According to this
principle one may, from an inference of two premises, proceed to infer from the
first premise of this inference a hypothetical proposition whose antecedent is
drawn from the second premise of the inference and whose consequent is drawn
from its conclusion. From Chrysippus’ rule, according to which from a first pre-
mise of the form N (A, B) and a second premise of the form A, a conclusion of the
form N B follows, one may, according to the conditionalization principle, immedi-
ately proceed to a consequence of the form
N (A, B)
H (A, N B).
Hence a proposition of the form H (A, N B) follows purely logically from a propo-
sition of the form N (A, B).
But, conversely, a proposition of the form N (A, B) follows purely logically
from a proposition of the form H (A, N B) as well. For ‘H (A, N B)’ means that A
and B are incompatible. Therefore, NM (A, B) logically follows from H (A, N B).
Now ‘not possible’ is equivalent to ‘necessarily not’ (‘LN’), and from the logically
stronger formula LN (A, B) follows the logically weaker formula N (A, B). So also
holds:

141

H (A, N B)
N (A, B).160
Hence, ‘N (A, B)’ may be replaced everywhere with the equivalent expression ‘H (A,
N B)’.161
Finally, the schema of a proposition in which a conjunctive expression is
nested is replaceable by a conjunction-free schema as well. Two cases are think-
able. Either the proposition is hypothetical, or it is disjunctive. If disjunctive, it is
equivalent to a conjunction of hypothetical components. (See § 47, def. 3.) If the
compound is hypothetical, either the antecedent or the consequent can contain a
conjunction. In the first case it has the form H ((A, B), C) and is, according to § 30,
replaceable with the equivalent expression H (A, H (B, C)). In the second case, it
has the form H (A, (B, C)) and is replaceable with H (A, NH (B, N C)). This replace-
ability rests on the general replaceability of conjunctive expressions of the form
(A, B) with negated hypothetical expressions. (For the extensive proof of this re-
placeability, see Appendix 1.)
It follows from these considerations that elementary conjunction is dispens-
able as a logical constant of the syllogistic.
As a result, the principles of the syllogistic can be formulated completely in a
vocabulary which contains neither elementary nor truth-functional logical conjunc-
tion. The three non-syllogistic principles which the calculus of functions rests on
can and indeed must be formulated in this vocabulary as well. The elementary lan-
guage of the syllogistic suffices to present them.162 The principles of the syllogistic
thus coincide with the principles of the elementary syllogistic (in the sense of § 15).
For the relations between elementary conjunction and ‘if . . ., then . . .’ see the more de-
tailed Appendix 1 below.
At the end of § 30, it had turned out that ‘H (A, B)’ is equivalent to ‘NM (A, N B)’. Now, it
turns out in addition that ‘N (A, B)’ is equivalent to ‘H (A, N B)’.
To this extent, Galen and Alexander of Aphrodisias were correct in their objections to Chrysip-
pus. For the same reason, Kant’s claim for the completeness of his table of judgment can be upheld.

II Synthetic Part: Construction of the Logical
Calculus of Functions from the Elements
of the Syllogistic


§ 41 General Preliminary Remark
The part of the present essay that begins here is arranged so that its first five sec-
tions concern only syllogistic rules and principles. Only in the sixth and seventh
section will non-syllogistic rules and principles be treated. By syllogistic rules I
mean here only such rules which can be formulated in a language which I desig-
nated above – at the end of § 15 – as the elementary language of the syllogistic, the
validity of which rests solely on the meaning of the logical constants that occur in
it. Simply formulating non-syllogistic rules requires no other logical constants be-
sides those of the elementary syllogistic. But the validity of these rules does not rest
on the meaning of these constants. I would like to show that all logical rules which
can be expressed in the language of the calculus of functions are reducible to syllo-
gistic rules, provided that we grant validity to the three principles that are not
strictly universally valid, since this validity is implicitly assumed in the calculus of
functions: these are the principles of the affirmative use of double negation (for
pairs of propositions of the form A and N A), arbitrary sufficient reason, and non-
empty domains (see § 39 above).163 Within the elementary syllogistic they are not
valid, but they can nevertheless be formulated in its language (and actually only in
its language).
To show that the validity of syllogistic rules rests only on the meaning of logi-
cal constants which occur in the expressions of these rules, it is first necessary to
fix this meaning explicitly through definitions. Rules whose validity can be sup-
ported directly by definitions I call principles. They should merely bring to ex-
pression in a different form what the definitions already express. Their content
rests essentially on the analysis of logical vocabulary carried out in Part I of this
essay.
Yet I do not wish to impose on all the definitions which will be established in
what follows the task of making intelligible and explaining the validity of princi-
ples. As I have shown in Part I of this essay, the vocabulary of the calculus of
functions, insofar as it consists of non-syllogistic logical constants and quantifiers,
can be explained as serving to abbreviate complex expressions, and indeed such
expressions as can be completely represented in a language which I designated at
the end of § 15 as the elementary language of the syllogistic. Thus, no new basic
rules will result from the discussion of the use of quantifiers (in § 65) or from the
The calculus of functions of the second level and higher, the language of which unjustifiably
(see § 28 and § 37) permits quantifying over function variables as well, is not considered in what
follows. In Appendix 2, I show that the step into predicate logic of the second level, which Frege
carried out to derive the generalized principle of mathematical induction from the basic proposi-
tions of his Begriffsschrift (see Frege 1879/1967, § 26), can be avoided.

explanation of the meaning of truth-functional constants (in § 71), but rather only
rules for abbreviating expressions.
The syllogistic and non-syllogistic principles will be established in what fol-
lows neither as propositions nor as propositional schemata. Instead, they will ex-
clusively take the form of rules and be expressed in inference schemata. Even if it
is always possible to render rules and inference schemata in the form of ‘if-then’
expressions, I will entirely forgo this mode of presentation. I will explain the
meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ by means of a definition in which the concept of the
regular consequence of propositions from other propositions is assumed (see § 47,
def. 2). This definition comes down to the same as the explanation given at the
end of § 30, according to which ‘if . . ., then . . .’ is equivalent to ‘it is impossible
that both: . . . and not . . . .’. What it means for a proposition to follow regularly
from other propositions will be explained in § 43 with just this expression.
Definition 3 in § 43 belongs among the few fundamental definitions on which
depends the validity of those special basic rules which must be made use of to be
able to derive rules from other rules at all. These basic rules are metalogical rules.
They must be established first of all, since the synthetic derivation procedure in its
entirety, which makes up the whole of Part II of this book, depends on them.
Given the metalogical character of this procedure, it would not be correct to
call it deductive or axiomatic – although there are some respects in which it is simi-
lar to a deductive-axiomatic procedure. Typically, a deductive-axiomatic method al-
ready makes use of rules of deductive inference, even applying them to principles
which are not in the form of rules, but rather in the form of propositions. A deduc-
tive-axiomatic method is synthetic in the sense that it ties together given principles
or already derived theorems as premises or premise schemata in such a way that,
according to a given basic rule, a conclusion or conclusion schema results. Each
theorem derived according to the deductive-axiomatic method is derived as a con-
clusion or as a conclusion schema. By contrast, the synthetic method which I make
use of in what follows consists in joining principles (which for their part only ren-
der rules) and theorems (which likewise express only rules), not to inferences or
inference schemata, but rather to schemata of inference chains. Metalogical rules
are here needed to reduce schemata of inferences and of inference chains to other
schemata and to abbreviate inference chains.
In their essentials, all metalogical rules which I make use of can be traced
back to three metalogical basic rules, the validity of which depends on definitions
of logical constants and metalogical signs (namely, the signs of regular and logical
consequence). One of these three rules specifies how one may abbreviate infer-
ence chains. This rule was already known in the school of Aristotle, and this under
the name “synthetic theorem,” and will be rendered below (in § 44) by rule (I. 3).
146
Part II

The second basic rule (see § 44, rule (I. 2)) specifies merely how one may, as-
suming the validity of just one inference, proceed to another inference. This rule
likewise corresponds to an ancient rule of argumentation, known already even in
the pre-Aristotelian era, which I, following the traditional nomenclature, call ‘reduc-
tio ad absurdum’ and which appears in the Aristotelian syllogistic as reductio ad
impossibile. As a metalogical rule, it should of course not be confused with the rule
that is likewise called reductio ad absurdum, which in the method of so-called natu-
ral deduction is used for the introduction of the sign for truth-functional negation.
Finally, the third metalogical basic rule (see § 48, rule (II. 1)) is also one that
was already familiar to ancient logicians. According to this rule, it is permitted to
proceed from an inference whose validity is already granted, to a second infer-
ence, whose premises are the same as the first with one exception, and whose
conclusion is a hypothetical proposition whose antecedent is the exceptional
premise and whose consequent is the conclusion of the first inference. I call this
basic rule the principle of conditionalization.
The synthetic character of the derivation procedure which I use here, in line
with the just given description, rests essentially on the application of the metalo-
gical basic rule I mentioned first, namely, the synthetic principle of the ancient
Peripatetics. For this reason, one could designate the method I take up to derive
logical rules the method of inference chain abbreviation. I will call it the syllogistic
method of derivation, thanks to its provenance in the ancient syllogistic.164
In the following reconstruction of the validity proofs of the Aristotelian syllogistic, I assume
that Aristotle was familiar with this method in its essentials. No direct evidence for or against
Aristotle’s familiarity (or the probability of his familiarity) with rules (I. 3) and (II. 1) have been
offered up to this point, as far as I know. My supposition that he made use not only of rule (I. 2)
but also of these other rules, however, can already be seen to be not implausible by the fact that
the syllogistic method demonstrably goes back to the school of Aristotle, and other methods for
proving the validity of syllogisms have not survived from antiquity. In addition, carrying out
proofs according to the syllogistic method is so simple, clear, convenient, and brief that it is in no
way inferior, but rather much superior, in ‘naturalness’ to the method of so-called natural deduc-
tion (despite its name), which Aristotle certainly could not have known (since it was developed
by Gerhard Gentzen only in the last century), which some of Aristotle’s modern commentators
and interpreters (e.g., Ebert & Nortmann 2007) have used to reconstruct Aristotelian proofs
nevertheless.

Section One
Rules for Deriving Rules
1 Principles
§ 42 Notation
The language of the elementary syllogistic will be gradually constructed in this
and in the following four sections. In the next three paragraphs we are concerned
only with a few signs, namely, only those allotted to this language to present the
derivation of rules from other rules. They are the following:
(1) Descriptive symbols: I use ‘p1, ‘p2’, . . ., ‘pn’ as signs for propositions. Each of
these signs stands for a certain declarative proposition and can be regarded as an
abbreviation for such a proposition. I use ‘p’, ‘q’, and ‘r’ to abbreviate the first
three signs ‘p1, ‘p2’, and ‘p3’.
(2) Logical constants: Of the logical signs which can appear within a proposition,
in this section the only one that occurs is ‘N . . .’, the sign for elementary negation.
Its meaning will be explained in § 43, definition 2.
(3) Metalogical signs: More than one kind of sign will be needed to be able to
speak about the logical properties of propositions and about the relations be-
tween propositions rendered with logical constants. As names (or metavariables)
for formulas that stand for declarative propositions, such as, e.g., ‘p1’, ‘N p2’, or
‘NN p3’, I use a non-cursive capital letter, e.g., A, with a subscripted index number:
‘A1, ‘A2’, ‘A3’, . . ., ‘An’. To abbreviate, I also write instead of the first five of these
signs ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, and ‘E’.
To express that a proposition B regularly follows from a set of propositions A1,
. . ., An, I write ‘A1, . . ., An  B’. To express that a proposition follows from others
logically, I write ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B’. Definitions 3 and 4 in § 43 will explain the distinc-
tion between regular and logical consequence.
To express that a rule of inference σn+1 can be reduced to a rule of inference
σn or to several rules of inference σ1, . . ., σn, I write ‘σ1, . . ., σn / σn+1’. The relation
between inferences expressed by ‘. . . / . . .’ will be explained in § 43, definition 5.
(4) Punctuation signs:
(a)
Comma: To save space, the first premises of an inference will not be written
one below the other, as in this example
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-005

but beside each other, separated by a comma, as in the example A, B ∴C or
A, B  C. Secondly, ‘A1, . . ., An  B, C’ and ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B, C’ express that
each B and C follow from the same premises.
(b)
Brackets: The binding strength of expressions of the form ‘N . . .’, ‘. . ., . . .’, ‘. . .
 . . .’ (or ‘. . . ∴. . . ’), and ‘. . . / . . .’ decrease in this order. When an expres-
sion that contains a logical constant or a metalogical sign is enclosed in round
brackets, ‘(. . .’ and ‘. . .)’, the parts of this expression are bound more strongly
together than with expressions outside the brackets.
(5) Simplification rules:
(a)
The outermost brackets of a formula may be omitted.
(b)
Two expressions ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B’ and ‘A1, . . ., An ∴C’ may be combined into the
expression ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B, C’. Likewise, two expressions ‘A1, . . ., Aj ∴B’ and
‘Ak, . . ., An ∴B’ may be combined into the expression ‘A1, . . ., Aj, Ak, . . .,
An ∴B’.
(c)
Two expressions ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B1, . . ., Bn’ and ‘B1, . . ., Bn ∴A1, . . ., An’ may be
combined into the expression ‘A1, . . ., An : : B1, . . ., Bn’. Likewise, two expres-
sions ‘A1, . . ., An  B1, . . ., Bn’ and ‘B1, . . ., Bn  A1, . . ., An’ may be combined
into the expression ‘A1, . . ., An  B1, . . ., Bn’.
(d)
The order of propositional formulas A1, A2, . . ., B, C, etc. may be arbitrarily
interchanged if they are separated by no other signs than commas and are the
only expressions that appear before or after the signs  or ∴. Thus, ‘A1, . . .,
An, B ∴C, D’ may be replaced by ‘B, A1, . . ., An ∴D, C’.
§ 43 Definitions
1. A is a negatable expression if and only if one of the two following conditions is
satisfied: (a) A is a substitute for one of the propositional letters p1, . . ., pn, i.e.,
there is an interpretation in which A is a true or false proposition, or (b) A equals
N B and B is in turn a negatable expression.
2. A is an elementary negation, that is, A equals N B (in words: not B), if and only
if, for every interpretation in which B and C are true or false: (1) A is true if B is
false or there is a false proposition C, with B = N C, and it is possible that N B and
N C are both true; (2) A is false if B is true or there is a true proposition C, with
B = N C, and it is possible that N B and N C are both false.

Part II Section One Rules for Deriving Rules

Scholium: ‘False’ should here mean simply ‘not true’. Propositions are in this
usage true or false (therefore bivalent).165
Elementary negation, as it is defined here, is not a truth function; i.e., the possible
truth values of the elementary negation are not sufficiently determined by the truth
value of the negated proposition. One could also say: there is no two-column truth
table for N B – unless one assumes for such a table that there is no C such that B equals
N C. But even in this case, the main column of the table contains a row which may not
be filled in with T or F, since it can happen that B and N B are both false.166
The question marks in this table are each supposed to express that the truth or
falsity of B is, in certain circumstances, compatible with the falsity or truth of
N B. The falsity of B is not a sufficient condition for the truth of N B. In case B and
N B are both false, N B is ambivalent with respect to its truth value, i.e., it is also
true. Namely, in this case N B is true insofar as N B rightly denies a false proposi-
tion, and at the same time false, insofar as N B is rightly negated by NN B. Because
of the possible truth-ambivalence of expressions of the form N C, the case can arise
in which N C and NN C are both true. This case is accounted for in the table. It is
the case in which B = N C and C as well as N C are both false. Only the case in
which B is a true proposition and there is no false proposition C with B = N C is a
case in which NN B is also true at the same time.
3. If A1, . . ., An (with n ≧1) and B are formulas which admit an interpretation
as true or false propositions, then with this interpretation B follows regularly
from A1, . . ., An (symbolically expressed: A1, . . ., An  B) if and only if it is im-
possible that each of the premises A1, . . ., An as well as N B is true, and it is im-
possible, if B is a negated proposition of the form N C, that each of the premises
A1, . . ., An as well as C is true.167

A proposition like “Ten is not a wicked number” – which one might treat as meaningless
and thus as neither true nor false – is false in all circumstances if one takes it as the elementary
negation of the proposition ‘Ten is a wicked number’. That it is false does not mean, however,
that the negated proposition is true. Compare my comments above in § 10.
See above, §§ 8 to 10.
In his 1936 work, Alfred Tarski has defined the concept of logical consequence in a similar way
as I have here defined the (broader) concept of regular consequence, namely thus: “The statement
form B is a logical consequence of the statement forms A1, . . ., An, if any interpretation of the propo-
sitional, predicate, and individual variables appearing in A1, . . ., An and B which turns all of A1, . . .,
1 Principles § 43
151

Scholium: This definition agrees in essentials with the four principles estab-
lished by Aristotle in An. pr. B 1–4 in order to isolate the concept of consequence.
These principles say roughly: (1) From the true, only the true follows; (2) from the
false, the true or false can follow; (3) the false can follow only if at least one prem-
ise is false; and (4) the true can follow from premises which are true or false.
The modality expressed in the above definition and in the Aristotelian princi-
ple (1) can be understood in such a way that it says that at no time and in no
thinkable circumstances is a proposition true whose consequent is nevertheless
false. Accordingly, a proposition q follows regularly from a proposition p if and
only if – on any grounds whatever – it holds at no time and in no thinkable cir-
cumstances that p and the negation of q are true. In this sense, one can say for
example that it follows regularly – say, on grounds pertaining to geometrical op-
tics – that the moon appears as a half-circle from the fact that it stands at quadra-
ture. In the same sense one can say that the diagnosis of a sickness follows – on
medical grounds – from the determination of all unambiguous symptoms of this
sickness. Valid rules, according to which such consequences occur and make pos-
sible contentful inference, can be rules of arbitrary content, e.g., conventions, nat-
ural laws, or mathematical theorems; they need not be logical rules: not all
grounds on which it is impossible or necessary that different propositions have
different or the same truth values are logical grounds.
Equivalent to the proposition ‘B follows regularly from A1, . . ., An’ is the proposition:
‘B (the consequent) may be concluded from A1, . . ., An (the premises)’. The consequence
which is here being discussed need not be a consequence valid on formal grounds or
according to logical rules. If n is greater than 1, then the consequence is called an infer-
ence and the consequent a concluding proposition or simply a conclusion.
4. If A1, . . ., An (with n ≧1) and B are formulas which admit an interpretation as
true or false propositions, then B follows logically from A1, . . ., An (symbolically
expressed: A1, . . ., An ∴B) if and only if the proposition B follows regularly from
A1, . . ., An and this consequence depends only on the definition of the logical con-
stants which occur in B and A1, . . ., An respectively.
Scholium: Logical consequence is a special case of regular consequence; it is
namely just that form of consequence based on the meaning of logical constants
which occur in those propositions between which the consequence relation obtains.
I call an inference from two premises whose conclusion follows logically
from them a formal inference or syllogism.
An into true statements, also turns B into a true statement.” In §§ 80–81, I will go more precisely into
the relationship between the now standard (‘semantic’) concept of logical consequence, which goes
back to Tarski, and the here defined concept of regular consequence.

Part II Section One Rules for Deriving Rules

5. If σ1, . . ., σn and σn+1 are rules according to which propositions follow from
other propositions regularly, then σn+1 is reducible to σ1, . . ., σn (symbolically ex-
pressed: σ1, . . ., σn /σn+1) if and only if, on that assumption that σ1, . . ., σn are valid
rules, σn+1 cannot be an invalid rule.
§ 44 Basic Rules
By basic rules I understand here and in what follows only those rules whose va-
lidity depends exclusively and immediately on the meaning of the logical and
meta-logical signs which are used in their formulation. To see their validity, it suf-
fices to consider the definitions which underlie the signs used in them. Denying
their validity results in a contradiction with the respective definitions.
If A, Ai, . . ., Ak, B, Cm, . . ., Cn and D are formulas which admit an interpreta-
tion which has one of the two truth values, then there are valid rules which corre-
spond to schemata (I. 1) to (I. 3):
1. Double negation as a result of an affirmation:
A ∴NN A (with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B) 168
(I. 1)
2. Reduction rules:
Reduction rules are metalogical rules, i.e., rules for the derivation of logical rules.
Reductio ad absurdum (or rule for inference conversion):
(A1, . . ., An ∴A) / (N A, A2, . . ., An ∴N A1), . . ., (N A, A1, . . ., An-1 ∴N An) (with n ≧1)
(I. 2)
Scholium: The schema (I. 2) corresponds to a metalogical basic rule of the Aristote-
lian syllogistic.169 Apuleius formulates it in this way: “If a third [proposition] is col-
lected [i.e., is inferred] from two, either of them together with the opposite of the
conclusion collects [i.e., entails] the opposite of the remaining one” (Apuleius, De int.
The converse counterpart to (I. 1), that is: NN A ∴A, is not valid, since NN A does not state
that A is true, but rather only that N A is false, and it is not ruled out that A and N A are both
false. The medieval doctrine “duplicata negatio efficit affirmatio” – which, based on Diogenes
Laertius, Vitae, VII. 89, is sometimes attributed already to Chrysippus – holds only for A = N B,
with B ≠N C (for arbitrary C), or in the form (VI. 4) NN A  A; see § 72 below.
See Aristotle, Sophistici Elenchi 163 a 32 and An. pr. 59 b 1 ff.; cf. Alexander, In an. pr. 29, 7 ff.,
In top. 582, 23 ff. and Philoponus, In an. pr. 423, 4 ff. On these passages, see Frede 1974, 172. – The
rule also plays a fundamental role in Stoic logic under the name “first directive” (πρῶτον ϑέμα).

Rather, this order may be arbitrarily altered in a derivation.

(I. 3)
Scholium: The inference chain schema (I. 3) corresponds to the so-called synthetic theo-
rem of the Peripatetic syllogistic.171 Its validity results from the transitivity of the rela-
tion of logical consequence, which is why B may be omitted in the third position. Here
as well, the index signs do not specify a fixed order of premise formulas. This order
may be arbitrary altered in a derivation (according to § 42 (5) (d)).

the synthetic theorem in a form which substantially corresponds to schema (I. 3).
Rules (I. 4), (I. 5), and (II. 6) correspond to the three metalogical rules – so-called directives
(ϑέματα) – in Stoic logic. They go by the designations “second,” “third,” and “fourth directive,”
respectively. According to Alexander of Aphrodisias, the Stoics developed these three rules from
the synthetic theorem of Peripatetic logic. See Alexander, In an. pr. 284, 13–15. The way in which I
present these rules here corresponds to the reconstruction of these rules by Frede; compare his
1974, 178–80. Instead of letters as metavariables, the Stoics use designations for numbers of
order: “the first,” “the second,” etc.
Rule (I. 4) agrees with the third directive of the Stoic syllogistic; cf. Frede’s 1974, 192–93,

The reduction formula in line [1] of this derivation is identical to (I. 3). The move
from [1] to [2] results from the stipulation of m = 1 and Cn = Cm.

/ (Ai, . . ., An ∴D)
The reduction formula in line [1] corresponds to rule (I. 4), the reduction formula
in line [2] corresponds to basic rule (I. 3). The move from [2] to [3] depends merely
on substitutions, namely on the substitution (1) of C for B, (2) of Ak+1, . . ., An (with n
≧k + 1) for Ai, . . ., Ak, and (3) of Ai, . . ., Ak (with i ≧0 and k ≧1) for Cm, . . ., Cn.
The move to [4] is possible for the following reason: the same expression, ‘Ai, . . .,
Ak, C ∴D’, stands behind the sign ‘/’ in line [1], while it stands before that sign in line
[3]. This means that the expression may be replaced in [3] by the whole expression
which stands before the sign ‘/’ in [1]. The license for this replacement rests on the
transitivity of the relation of reducibility. The reduction formula is in this respect a
combination of the reduction formulas of lines [1] and [3].

General notice on notation:
I use the following abbreviations in proofs for the validity of rules which are not
metalogical rules:
All lines of the proof are designated with numerals in square brackets on the left
side. To the right of this designation, there is a symbolic expression which indicates
the schema either of a basic rule, a rule already proven as valid, or a provable rule.
If it is a basic rule or an already proven rule, then on the right side of the line there
is only the designation of its schema (e.g., ‘(I. 1)’, as in line [1] in the proof above for
(I. 6)). If it is a provable rule (or the rule to be proved), then on the right side of the
column there are two references. The first reference is the designation of a rule, ac-
cording to which the expression standing in the same line has been derived (e.g.,
(I. 2) as in line [2] of the above proof). The second reference, placed to the right, indi-
cates in square brackets either one or more of the preceding lines to whose formula
the mentioned rule has been applied. If more than one line is referenced, the line
numbers are placed together in square brackets.

Scholium: The addition “(with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B)” appearing in (I. 1), (I. 6),
(I. 7), and (I. 8) prohibits erroneous substitutions. Thus a rule would be clearly
invalid which corresponded to the schema N B ∴NNN B (with B ≠N C for an
arbitrary C) and was gained from (I. 1) by substitution. Consider the case in
which there is an interpretation in which both B and N B are false. In this case,
N B is compatible with NN B. It is thus not impossible that N B is true but NNN B
false. Accordingly, NNN B does not follow logically from N B – assuming that
“logical consequence” is understood in the sense of § 43, def. 4.
If N B ∴NNN B yielded a valid rule, then on the basis of (I. 6) – as well as
(I. 4) – the validity of N B ∴N B would be provable. It is conceivable, however, as in
the case we have considered, that N B is compatible with NN B. Hence, it cannot be
true that N B follows logically from N B.
156
Part II Section One Rules for Deriving Rules

Since a rule of the form N B ∴N B is obviously invalid, it is also obvious that
a rule of the form A ∴A is invalid. In order to see this, we do not have to take the
indirect route of seeing the invalidity of N B ∴N B. Rather, we can see that the
expression ‘A ∴A’ is not a valid rule already from the fact that in this expression
there appear no logical constants on whose meaning could rest the logical conse-
quence (as according to § 43, def. 4) of A from A.
The reason why it is impossible that A is true as a premise but false as a con-
clusion can only consist in the fact that A gets an interpretation in the places of its
occurrence according to which A is incompatible with N A. However, nothing
forces us to regard this reason as a logical one, especially since it is already estab-
lished that there is an interpretation for A in which A equals N B and N B is com-
patible with NN B.
If there is a valid rule according to which a proposition follows from itself,
then it cannot express a logical but at best a regular consequence and take the form:
‘A  A’. Such a rule will be discussed further below (see § 72, scholium to rule (VI. 3)).

Section Two
Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic
1 Preliminary Remark
By hypothetical syllogistic I understand the theory of valid inferences which can
be drawn from one or more ‘if-then’ propositions in conjunction with other pre-
mises. I designate as disjunctive syllogistic a theory which pertains correspond-
ingly to ‘either-or’ propositions. In these theories, the meanings of ‘if . . ., then . . .’
and ‘either . . ., or . . .’ will be fixed with definitions which will be established
below in § 47 for hypothetical and disjunctive propositions. We could call both
theories taken together – the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic – the logic of
conditional statements, since hypothetical and disjunctive propositions can be un-
derstood as propositions that ascribe only conditional truth to statements of the
clauses they consist of.
Contrary to a widespread opinion according to which Aristotle was only fa-
miliar with a categorical syllogistic, the basics of the hypothetical and disjunc-
tive syllogistic go back to Aristotle and his school. In that school, hypothetical
and disjunctive syllogisms were treated under the common designation for syl-
logisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως [‘from a presupposition’]. Aristotle mentions the theory
which is meant to deal systematically with such modes of inference in Analytica
priora 1. 44, 50 b 1–2, though only as program yet to be carried out. He insists in
1. 44, 50 a 16 f. that these modes of inference are not reducible to the categorical.
In 1. 45 b 19 f., he even announces a systematic treatment of the non-categorical
syllogistic which is to investigate how many types of inference ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως
there are. According to Alexander of Aphrodisias, In An. pr. 390, 1 ff., Aristotle’s
system of presuppositional inferences depends on the supposition of a total of
four elementary rules of inference, presumably including modus ponendo po-
nens (see rule (II. 2) below). According to Alexander, the students of Aristotle
Theophrastus of Eresos and Eudemus of Rhodes were supposed to have made
the Aristotelian presuppositional inferences into the subject of systematic logi-
cal investigations.176
Niko Strobach and Theodor Ebert have argued that the inferences Aristotle des-
ignates as syllogisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως are not syllogisms in the sense of the relevant
definition of syllogism in An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 18–22, where “Aristotle has fixed the con-
cept of syllogism so that only inferences which deduce a predicative statement from
For more details, see Frede 1974, 17–18.

predicative statements can count as syllogisms”; this “fixing” is supposed to be seen
in a “determination” within the definitional formula used by Aristotle, according to
which syllogisms “‘[need] no further term from outside in order for the necessity to
come about (24 b 21 f.)’” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 859).177 With this determination,
Aristotle “blocked the path to accepting in his logical theory inferences in which con-
ditional statements play a role”, as are characteristic of presuppositional inferences,
e.g., for inferences of modus ponendo ponens (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 859).178 –
What is overlooked here is the fact that Aristotle also explicitly supposes of presup-
positional inferences that they are inferences from predicative statements to predi-
cative statements. He says, namely, that “every syllogism must prove something
either to belong or not to belong, and this either universally or particularly, and in
addition either probatively or from a presupposition [ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως]” (Aristotle, An.
pr. 1. 23, 40 b 23–25 [1989, 3, slightly modified]). Accordingly, all syllogisms, including
syllogisms ἐξ ὑποϑέσεως, are regarded as inferences whose premises and conclu-
sions are predicative propositions or contain predicative propositions, even if this
fact does not have to play any role in the logical form of these inferences. Hence,
even presuppositional inferences need nothing “further”, nothing to be added “from
outside” (ἔξωϑεν), i.e., a “term” (ὅϱος) contained in an additional premise, in order
to be a compelling consequence. Incidentally, in his commentary on the passage in
question, 24 b 18–22, Ebert himself points out that Aristotle’s word ὅρος is not only
used in the sense of “term”: rather Aristotle “here and also elsewhere in the Analytics
often speaks of a term but means a statement in which this term occurs” (Ebert &
Nortmann 2007, 227). It is thus not at all inconsistent when Aristotle designates pre-
suppositional inferences (and thus what I treat here and in what follows as hypothe-
tical syllogisms) as syllogisms without any reservation.

§ 46 Notation
In addition to the signs introduced in § 42, in this section two further signs will be
needed. They are the logical constants ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ and ‘D ( )’ (with at least two
empty places). A two-place relational expression of the form H (A, B) stands for
the hypothetical proposition in the sense of § 47, def. 2. The n-place relational

expression D (A1, . . ., An) with n ≧2, stands for the disjunctive proposition in the
sense of § 47, def. 3.
§ 47 Definitions
1. A is a formula of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic if and only if A sa-
tisfies one of the following conditions: (a) A is a negatable expression (in the
sense of § 43, def. 1), or (b) A is a hypothetical or disjunctive proposition.
2. A is a hypothetical proposition, i.e., A equals H (B, C) (in words: if B, then C), if and
only if, if B, C, and D are formulas of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic,
and for any interpretation in which B, C, and D, are propositions which have one of
the two truth values, then the following holds: A is true if and only if C follows reg-
ularly from B (according to § 43, def. 3), so that B is incompatible with N C and, in
case C has the form N D, also incompatible with D.
Scholium: Hypothetical propositions can be rendered with ‘if-then’- proposi-
tions. They are, according to the definitions just given, not truth functions; i.e., the
truth value of a hypothetical proposition does not depend exclusively on the truth
value of its clauses. To be sure, it is only true if these values are distributed in a
certain way among its clauses. But this distribution is not sufficient to make it true.
Nor does it suffice that its antecedent is false. Only in one of the four rows of the
main column of the truth table for H (A, B) is a definite value (namely, the value F)
fixed by the truth values of both clauses; for the remaining three rows, no such
value exists. The question marks in these rows do not stand for a third truth
value – say, the value indefinite –, but merely indicate that the truth value in the
three cases is not sufficiently determined by the truth values of the clauses:
The view that only the occurrence of a consequence (ἀκολουϑία, consequentia) can
make a hypothetical proposition true corresponds to a doctrine widespread since
antiquity, according to which the meaning of an ‘if-then’ proposition must be made
explicit with the aid of the concept of consequence. Sextus Empiricus reports:

Part II Section Two Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic

Now all the dialecticians agree in asserting that a conditional holds whenever its conse-
quent follows from its antecedent; but as to when and how it follows, they disagree with
one another and set forth conflicting criteria for this ‘following’. (Sextus Empiricus, Adv.
Math. VIII, 112 [Mates 1973, 97])179
The Stoic Chrysippus seems to have been the logician among those Sextus Empiri-
cus reports on who held the view that ‘if p, then q’ means that the negation of q
“conflicts” with the antecedent p (Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrronhism II, 112).
Accordingly, Chrysippus explained the consequence found in a hypothetical propo-
sition in a similar way as Lewis and Langford (1932, 154) explained the relation
they called ‘strict implication’: “That p strictly implies q means that p is inconsistent
with the denial of q.” The distinction between Chrysippus’ conception and that of
Langford and Lewis lies merely in that Chrysippus seems not to have made explicit
what he called negation and conflict by means of unambiguously truth-functional
expressions. If we replace all truth-functional signs which occur in the expression
‘~ ◇(p & ~ q)’ (which for Lewis and Langford renders the strict implication of q by
p) with non-truth-functional signs, as per § 30, then we get an expression – ‘NM (p,
N q)’ –, which according to my definition of the hypothetical proposition is equiva-
lent to ‘if p, then q’ and is suited to explicate Chrysippus’ explanation of the hypo-
thetical proposition at least no less than the definition of strict implication.
While in the above definition the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ is traced back
to the meaning of the concept of regular consequence, it seems to have been an
interest of Stoic logic to be able to explain, conversely, the meaning of the concept
of consequence with the aid of the truth conditions of the hypothetical proposi-
tion. They apparently wanted to determine what a demonstrative consequence is
by means of the concept of a true hypothetical proposition:
[Inferences] are valid whenever the conditional whose antecedent is the conjunction of the
premises and whose consequent is the conclusion, is sound. (Sextus, Outlines of Pyrhhonism
II, 137 [Mates 1996, 147])180
Accordingly, the idea that the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’ can be fixed with the aid
of the concept of regular consequence cannot have been completely foreign even to
Sextus Empiricus reports on the various approaches which especially in Stoic and Megarian
logic were made to more precisely specify the truth conditions of the hypothetical proposition in his
Outlines of Pyrrhonism, II, 110–11. According to this report, Philo of Megara held a truth-functional
reading of the hypothetical proposition: “For Philo says that a true conditional is one which does
not have a true antecedent and a false consequent; for example, when it is day and I am conversing,
‘If it is day, then I am conversing’” (Mates 1973, 109). – Cf. Ebert 1991, 84–130; 319.

the Stoics. Namely, they maintained181 that it results from the meaning of ‘if . . .,
then . . .’ that both the hypothetical syllogisms they took to be elementary, modus
ponendo ponens and modus tollendo tollens, are valid syllogisms. They thus main-
tained that anyone who assumes a proposition of the form H (A, B) as true immedi-
ately also assumes that B follows from A (so that once A or N B is a second premise,
then B or N A, respectively, is regarded as the conclusion of a valid inference). –
According to Michael Frede’s account, the Stoics took their departure from the fact
that a hypothetical proposition is always “the expression of a supposition that can
possibly be demonstrated about the connection of states of affairs,” while con-
versely logicians like Aristotle and Theophrastus tended to regard hypothetical
propositions as “the expression of an understanding that something should be
treated as demonstrated or refuted if something else has been demonstrated or re-
futed” (Frede 1974, 16).182 – The definition I have adopted corresponds more to the
Aristotelian than to the Stoic conception of the hypothetical proposition. What a
hypothetical proposition is can be explained by what it means for a proposition
that is to be proved to follow from an already accepted proposition, or by what it
means for a proposition that is to be disproved to follow from another, already dis-
proved proposition.
3. A is a disjunctive proposition, i.e., A equals D (A1, . . ., An), with n > 1 (in words:
either A1, or . . ., or An), if and only if, for any interpretation in which A1, . . ., An are
true or false propositions, the following condition is satisfied: A is true if and only if
from one of the propositions A1, . . ., An the negation of each of the remaining prop-
ositions regularly follows (i.e., when from Ai, with n ≧i ≧1, N Ak, with n ≧k ≧i,
regularly follows), and if from the negation of one of the propositions A1, . . ., An,
exactly one of the remaining propositions regularly follows (i.e., when from N Ai,
with n ≧i ≧1, exactly one of the propositions Ak, with n ≧k ≠i, regularly follows).
Scholium: The disjunctive proposition is not a truth function either. It is not
sufficient for the truth of a disjunctive proposition that exactly one of its clauses
is true. Hence, the truth table for the disjunctive compound is necessarily gappy,
and its main column contains only the value F when the truth values of the
clauses are clearly determined. For example, the table for the three-member dis-
junctive compound looks like this:

Part II Section Two Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic

In order to make clear the distinction between a truth-functional and non-truth-
functional disjunctive compound, consider an example which was discussed in
ancient logic:183
The proposition ‘Either now is day, or now is night’ is on a truth-functionally
understood ‘either . . ., or . . .’ already true when it is now (let’s say at noon
on January 30, 2009) day and not night. Whether there is a point in time apart
from day and night, whether there is even a division of the totality of alternatives,
is irrelevant according to this understanding of the truth of the proposition. As a
truth function, the same proposition would also be true if its second part would
have stated: ‘. . ., or triangles have only two corners’. But as a complete enumera-
tion of alternatives, the proposition is not at all true, and thus, as a disjunctive
proposition in the sense of the definition established above, is false. Otherwise,
the second premise in the following inference should not be true and the conclu-
sion should not be false (see Alexander, In an. pr. 374, 25 ff.):
Either now is night or now is day.
If nothing exists now [that would bring about the distinction of day and night], now is not
night.
Thus: if nothing exists now [that would bring about the distinction of day and night], now
is day.

On the meaning of ‘(either) . . . or . . .’ there was a discussion in ancient logic which mirrors
quite exactly the one concerning the meaning of ‘if . . ., then . . .’. According to Mates (1973, 51),
two types of disjunction were distinguished by the Stoics, the exclusive and the inclusive. Inclusive
disjunction corresponds to modern (truth-functional) adjunction (‘p or q, or both p and q’). Yet
some Stoics demand incompatibility for disjunctive members (1973, 52–53), and thus exclusivity.
This reading seems to correspond to modern (truth-functional) bisubtraction – ‘p or q, but not
both’ –, as long as only two-membered disjunctions are considered. However, Frede (1974, 96)
mentions Plutarch’s statement (De Sollertia Animalium 969 A) that a many-membered disjunction
must be “complete” “if it is possible neither that the members are true together, nor that they are
false together.” This statement belongs to a tradition which Kant (see CPR § 9) was part of as well.
2 Principles § 47
163

Since the concluding proposition is clearly false, and since the second premise is
undeniably true, the first premise cannot be true. But since it is a disjunctive
proposition, and since it is now day and not night, it can be a false proposition
only in terms of the definition of a disjunction, i.e., not as a truth function.
§ 48 Basic Rules
If A, A1, . . ., An, B, and C are formulas which admit an interpretation as propositions
which have one of the two truth values, then the following rules (II. 1) to (II. 4) are
valid:
1. Extension of the system of metalogical reduction rules:
Principle of conditionalization:184
Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C / Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C) (with i ≧0 and k ≧i)
(II. 1)
The validity of this basic rule rests on the definitions of the hypothetical proposi-
tion and of logical consequence. By the sign ‘∴’ on the left side of ‘/’ in (II. 1) it is
expressed that C follows logically from the premises Ai, . . . Ak and therefore can-
not be false, if (in addition to these premises) B is also true. This means that, as
per § 43, def. 4, ‘H (B, C)’ follows logically from the same premises.
2. Basic rule of the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic:
Modus ponendo ponens:
H (A, B), A ∴B
(II. 2)
Scholium: There is evidence that Aristotle and his students, as well as the Megar-
ian logicians, regarded modus ponendo ponens as not further reduceable. (See my
preliminary remark to this Section and Frede 1974, p. 15–18)
3. Reduction of disjunctions to hypothetical propositions:
Reduction of two-membered disjunctions:
D (A1, A2) : : H (A1, N A2), H (N A1, A2), H (N A2, A1), H (A2, N A1)
(II. 3)
Reduction of three-membered disjunctions:

H (D (A1, A3), N A2),
H (D (A2, A3), N A1),

3 Derivation of Formulas of the Hypothetical
and Disjunctive Syllogistic
§ 49 Derived Rules
If A, A1, . . ., An, B, and C are formulas which admit an interpretation as propositions
which have one of the two truth values, then the following rules (II. 5) to (II. 27), for
example, are valid:
1. Metalogical rules:
Deconditionalization of a conclusion:
Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C) / Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C (with i ≧0 and k ≧0)
(II. 5)
Derivation:
[1]
(Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (C, D)), (H (C, D), C ∴D) /
(Ai, . . ., Ak, C ∴D)
[2]
Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (C, D) / Ai, . . ., Ak, C ∴D
Line [1] is an application case of the metalogical basic rule (I. 3), with H (C, D) for B
and with C for Cm, . . ., Cn. Line [2] indicates that in line [1] the inference formula H
(C, D), C ∴D may be omitted for the sake of abbreviation, since it renders modus
ponendo ponens (II. 2) and thus an already universally valid rule.
Scholium: The metalogical rules rendered by (II. 1) and (II. 5) stand together at
the basis of a rule that was used in Stoic logic (see below the scholium to (II. 29)).
Idempotency rule:185
Ai . . ., Ak, A1, A1 ∴D / A1, Ai, . . ., Ak ∴D (with i ≧0, k ≧i)
(II. 6)
According to definition 4 in § 43, the proposition D logically follows from two
identical propositions A1 and A1 in conjunction with other propositions if and
only if D follows regularly from all these propositions and this consequence de-
pends only on the definition of the logical constants that occur in these proposi-
tions or in D. Whether A1 occurs more than once among the premises of D is thus

irrelevant to whether D follows from A1. In other words: basic rules remain valid
if their antecedents are duplicated, as, e.g., with these transformations of (II. 2):
H (A, B), A, A ∴B,
H (A, B), H (A, B), A ∴B.
2. Rules of hypothetical inference:

Proof:
[1] A, H (A, B) ∴B
(II. 2)
[2] N B, H (A, B) ∴N A
(I. 2) [1]
Scholium: The Stoics counted inferences according to modus tollendo tollens among
elementary inferences, i.e., those which are valid, but ‘unprovable’ and not further
reducible. The validity of these inferences, as well as the validity of the inferences of
modus ponendo ponens, depends in their view directly on the meaning of the logical
constants which occur in their hypothetical premises (see Frede 1974, 199). It is sus-
pected – even if we lack unambiguous evidence for it – that Aristotle and his stu-
dents, as well as the Megarian logicians, regarded modus tollendo tollens as an
elementary rule, i.e., as not further reducible (compare Frede 1974, 16–18).
Contraposition:

Proof:
[1] H (A, B), N B ∴N A
(II. 7)
[2] H (A, B) ∴H (N B, N A)

Scholium: Aristotle mentions this mode of inference in Analytica priora 2. 2, 53 b
12 f. (1989, 66) with the words: “For if it is necessary for B to be when A is, then
when B is not it is necessary for A not to be.” It is worth mentioning that Aristotle
here uses letter symbols not as concept variables, but rather as place-holders for
something that is true or false.

Scholium: By negating A, B, or C and by exchanging their places as antecedents or
consequents of hypothetical propositions, many types of hypothetical syllogisms
can be produced. Theophrastus is supposed to have systematically organized
these types, after the example of Aristotle’s division of categorical syllogisms, ac-
cording to three ‘figures’ of purely hypothetical syllogisms. See Kneale & Kneale
(1975, 110). According to their account, which is based on Alexander of Aphrodisias’
commentary on Aristotle’s Prior Analytics (Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca II. 1,
326), Aristotle provides an instance of the basic form (II. 13) of the purely hypotheti-
cal syllogism with the following inference: “[I]f it is necessary for an animal to be if
a man is, and a substance if an animal is, then it is necessary for a substance to be
if a man is [. . .]” (cf. An. pr. 1. 32, 47 a 28–30 [1989, 51]). Within Stoic logic, appar-
ently none of the types of purely hypothetical syllogisms found consideration, al-
though these types can, as the proof we just carried out for their basic form shows,
be reduced to the syllogisms that the Stoics regarded as elementary. In Frede’s
view (1974, 183 and 197), Stoic logic was systematically incomplete, since it did not
permit such a reduction. (See, by contrast, the above proof.)

Scholium: Aristotle discusses a variant of (II. 14), namely the inference from two
premises of the form (1) H (p, q) and (2) H (N p, q), in An. pr. 2. 4, 57 a 36–b 17. He
seems here to want to reject the inference to p. According to William & Martha
Kneale (1975, 97), Aristotle argues roughly as follows: by contraposition on (1) (i.e.,
on the basis of (II. 8)) we get: (3) H (N q, N p). From (3) and (2), following the rule
of the completely hypothetical syllogism (II. 13), we get the further consequence:
(4) H (N q, q). The Kneales suppose that Aristotle should infer from here to q,
since the inverse of peritrope (II. 10) is applicable. But they hereby tacitly assume
that the inverse of peritrope, as well as peritrope itself, permit not only the infer-
ence to NN p, but also the inference to p.

Scholium: Among the five syllogisms which the Stoics took to be elementary (i.e.,
valid but ‘unprovable’) are two rules which correspond to (II. 21) and (II. 22). On the
Stoic view, they are valid on the basis of the meaning of the logical constants which
occur in the major premise of the disjunctive syllogism (see Frede 1974, 199). It is
suspected (though we lack unambiguous evidence for it) that the Stoics were not
alone in this view, but that Aristotle and the Megarians also recognized elementary
disjunctive syllogisms (cf. Frede 1974, 16–18).

3 Derivation of Formulas of the Hypothetical and Disjunctive Syllogistic § 49
173

§ 50 Conditionalization
1. Derivation of metalogical rules
If A, B, and C are formulas of deductive logic, then a metalogical rule is valid
which corresponds to the following schema:
Rule of conditionalization:
✶, B ∴C / ✶∴H (B, C)
(II. 28)
Derivation:
[1] Ai, . . ., Ak, B ∴C / Ai, . . ., Ak ∴H (B, C)
(II. 1)
[2]
✶, B ∴C / ✶∴H (B, C)
Line [2] results from the substitution of the empty premise set (which here and in
what follows is designated with the asterisk ‘✶’) for Ai, . . ., Ak.188 This substitution is
permitted since the regular consequence of C from B rendered by ‘H (B, C)’, accord-
ing to § 43, def. 3, is a necessary condition for the logical consequence of C from B,
even if this consequence is independent of other premises.
Scholium: The supposition that a statement follows logically from the empty
premise set is equivalent to the supposition that this statement is logically valid.
Hence, one may, in case C follows logically from B, proceed to ‘✶∴H (B, C)’ and from
there to ‘H (B, C)’.
Generalized rule of conditionalization:
A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B / ✶∴H (A1, H (Ai, H (. . ., H (An, B))) . . .)
(with i ≧1, n ≧i)
(II. 29)
Derivation:
[1]
A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B / A1, . . . An–1 ∴H (An, B)
(II. 1)
[2]
A1, . . ., An–1 ∴H (An, B) /
A1, . . ., An–2, H (An–1, H (An, B))
(II. 1)
⋮
In the use of this notation here and in what follows, I follow Carnap (1934, § 31 and § 47).
The talk of an empty premise set is perhaps easily misunderstood. The little star ✶is meant to
indicate that the full transformation of an inference schema into a propositional schema through
conditionalization has come to completion. Such a completion comes about as soon as all premise
schema which belonged to the conditionalized inference schema have been converted into (more
or less nested) ‘if’-propositions. In other words, ‘A follows logically from the empty premise set’
basically means: ‘A is valid because the consequent C of A (= H (B, C)) logically follows from the
antecedent B of A.’

Scholium: The generalized conditionalization rule corresponds to a metalogical
basic rule which, according to Jan Łukasiewicz (1935, 115), was already a Stoic prin-
ciple. However, that principle must have been stronger than (II. 29), since it was
supposed to have said that an inference is valid if and only if a hypothetical state-
ment is true whose antecedent consists in a conjunction of premises and whose
consequent is identical with the conclusion. That is, the Stoics must have recog-
nized the inverse counterpart of the generalized rule of conditionalization as well,
i.e., (II. 30). Compare on this the account in Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Math., VIII,
415–23. In his book Stoic Logic (1973, 74–77, and Appendix A, 106–8), Benson Mates
has compared the Stoic principle highlighted by Łukasiewicz with the one he him-
self calls ‘principle of conditionalization’. This principle says: “If a conclusion β is
validly derivable from the premises α1, α2, . . ., αn, then the conditional proposition
‘(α1, α2, . . ., αn) ⊃β’ is logically true” (Mates 1973, 74–75). Mates certainly empha-
sizes: (1) the Stoics formulated their principle always as an equivalence claim, not
merely as a conditional proposition; (2) the contexts in which the Stoic principle
appears are always those in which Sextus interprets the Stoics as attempting to
give a criterion for the validity of inferences; (3) ‘logically true’ should be replaced
with another expression – Mates himself proposes replacing it with “Diodorian-
true”; and (4) there is no evidence available showing the Stoics using their principle
as a rule of inference. It would be appropriate to add a fifth point, namely: (5) the
Stoics understood ‘if . . ., then . . .’ not in the sense of ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, i.e., not in the Phil-
onic sense.189 – On the question of whether and in which way the Stoics used what
Mates has called a conditionalization principle, compare Frede (1974, 105–6).
I have taken up the word ‘conditionalization principle’ to label something
else than Mates does, namely the rule represented by (II. 1). Because the remain-
ing conditionalization rules (II. 5) and (II. 28) to (II. 30) depend on this latter rule,
I consider the deviation from Mates’ way of designating appropriate.
Deconditionalization (the converse counterpart to the generalized rule of conditionalization):
✶∴H (A1, H (Ai, H (. . ., H (An, B))) . . .) / ✶, A1, Ai, . . ., An ∴B

2. Derived universally valid propositional schemata
By conditionalization according to (II. 28), any universally valid rule of deductive
logic can be transformed into a formula which in the appropriate interpretation
becomes a nested hypothetical proposition which is logically valid. In what fol-
lows, I will call such a formula a ‘universally valid propositional schema’.
If A, B, and C are formulas of deductive logic, then the expressions (II. 31) to
(II. 33) are universally valid propositional schemata.
✶∴H (A, NN A) (with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B)
(II. 31)
Proof:
[1] A ∴NN A

[2]
✶, A ∴NN A / ✶∴H (A, NN A)
(II. 28)
[3]
✶∴H (A, NN A)

From modus ponendo ponens, we can get the following universally valid proposi-
tional schema:
✶∴H (A, H (H (A, B), B A))
(II. 32)
Proof:
[1] A, H (A, B) ∴B

Much more complicated universally valid propositional schemata can be derived
from modus ponendo ponens as well, e.g., the following:

an interesting distinction arises between forms of nested hypothetical propositions
on the one hand and forms of similarly nested subjunctions and forms of likewise
nested ‘strict implications’, as they were introduced by Wilhelm Ackermann.190
Compare, e.g., with formula (II. 32) the two following, similarly nested expres-
sions in which the arrow, ‘. . . →. . .’, indicates the relation of strict implication:
A →((A →B) →B),
A →(B →A).
According to Wilhelm Ackermann, neither of these two formulas are universally
valid. If ‘. . . →. . .’ were read as subjunction, then both formulas would be univer-
sally valid. If ‘. . . →. . .’ were taken as the hypothetical propositional connective,
then the first formula would be valid, but not the second.

Section Three
Categorical Syllogistic
1 Preliminary Remark
In contrast to the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic, the categorical syllogistic
has to do with rules of inferring from propositions that are not logically composite.
The rules of the categorical syllogistic depend therefore not on definitions which fix
the meaning of propositional connectives, but rather on definitions which fix the
meaning of expressions used to logically connect concept expressions.
2 Principles
§ 51 Notation
In this section the signs which were introduced in § 42 and § 46 will be put to
further use, as well as the following signs being added:
(1) Letter symbols: ‘α1, . . ., αn’ as concept variables (i.e., as substitutes for terms).
I abbreviate by replacing the first four concept variables ‘α1’, ‘α2’, ‘α3’, and ‘α4’
with ‘α’, ‘β’, ‘γ’, and ‘δ’.
(2) Logical constants: ‘A (. . ., . . .)’, ‘I (. . ., . . .)’, and ‘Ạ(. . ., . . .)’ for two-place
relations in which the concept variables appear in the empty places, as well
as ‘N. . . ’ to designate antonyms.
§ 52 Definitions
1. A is a formula of the categorical syllogistic if and only if A satisfies one of the
following conditions: (a) A takes the form of a universal, particular, or singular
affirmative proposition, or (b) A is a negatable expression (in the sense of § 43) and
equals N B or NN C, and B and C each take the form of a universal, particular, or
singular affirmative proposition.
Scholium: Categorical propositions are not truth functions, because they can-
not be reduced to simpler propositions, and if they are propositions of the form
N A, they do not contain a truth-functional negation. The truth of affirmative cate-
gorical propositions consists in their correspondence with the objects they deal
with. This correspondence presupposes that these objects exist, or in any case
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-007

belong to the ‘world of attributions’ in the sense of § 20. The truth of negative cate-
gorical propositions is independent of such a presupposition.191
2. A is a universally affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form A (α, β)
(in words: every β is an α), if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in
which A is a true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if
β is not an empty concept (thus, some object which falls under the concept β is a β
after all) and moreover, if any object – whether it falls under an arbitrary concept
γ or δ or whatever other concept – falls under the concept β, this very object γ
also falls under the concept α; (2) A is false if and only if N A (= O (α, β)) is true
and NN A = N O (α, β) is false (so that an arbitrary concept – call it γ or δ or whatever
else – can be formed for which it holds that: no object that falls under it falls under
the concept α, but there is an object that falls under it, and the latter falls under the
concept β if there is in that case some object at all that falls under the concept β).
Corollary to definition 2: If a proposition of the form A (α, β) is false, so that N A
(α, β) is true, according to definition 2 this means that β is an empty concept or it is
not true that, if some object which falls under an arbitrary concept γ also falls under
the concept β, this object γ falls under the concept α. This means: if N A (α, β) is true,
then a concept γ – e.g., the concept of a β that is not an α – can be formed for which
it holds that: there is, in case β is not an empty concept (so that some object that falls
under the concept β is a β), an object that falls under the concept γ, and this same
object γ also then falls under the concept β, but no object that falls under the concept
γ falls under the concept α.
I here make use of one of the ideas which I developed in Section Three of Part I (especially in
§ 32), namely the idea that the universal form of the categorical proposition cannot be rendered
in the language of the calculus of functions, and that it must be characterized by what I called
‘qualitative existential import’. This idea also seems to me to be compatible with the conception of
the categorical proposition in Aristotle. By contrast, Günther Patzig (1969, 47–48) cannot find sup-
port in the text of Aristotle when he writes: “The form of the proposition ‘A belongs to all B’ is in
mathematical logic (x) (Bx ⊃Ax). For Aristotle, the subject of this proposition is not the universal
class of individuals, but rather the class of individuals of which B holds, thus in short the class B.
And the predicate of the proposition is the predicate A. Aristotle’s conception thus differs from
the conception of mathematical logic in that in Aristotle the ‘universe of discourse’ is restricted to
the objects of which B holds. This restriction has the consequence that, though the Aristotelian
proposition is not true in any case in which the proposition in mathematical logic is false, in some
cases the proposition of Aristotle is neither true nor false, but rather meaningless while in the
interpretation of mathematical logic it is true: this occurs in all the cases in which an individual is
substituted for x which does not belong to the class B. The Aristotelian proposition says nothing at
all about this; yet the proposition in mathematical logic remains true in that case: it claims only
that the predicate A applies to x, if the predicate B applies to it.”
2 Principles § 52

Scholium: Definition 2 determines the meaning of both the logical constant A
(. . ., . . .) as well as the logical constant O (. . ., . . .). This determination corresponds
to how Aristotle understands their meaning. He fixes the meaning of the constant
A (. . ., . . .) with the following words (see An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30 [1989, 2]): “We use
the expression ‘[α is] predicated of every [β]’, whenever none (μηδὲν)192 of the
things [e.g., γ] which fall under the subject-term [β] can be taken (λαβεῖν) of which
the other term [α] cannot be said. And we use ‘[α is] predicated of none [no β]’ like
wise [that is, no β can be taken of which α can be said].” As for the constant O (. . ., . . .),
Michael Wedin (1990, 134–35) has pointed out the interesting fact that Aristotle does not
choose ‘Some S is not P’ as the canonical form of the O proposition, but rather ‘Not every
S is P’, and that this choice apparently expresses the view that O propositions can be
true without ‘existential import’. That Aristotle has an additional motive for this choice
can be seen in the fact that he explicitly takes the form ‘Some S is not P’ as the form of a
(quantitively) indefinite (ἀδιόριστος) proposition (An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b 14–19), i.e., as the form
of a proposition which can be understood both as an O and as an E proposition (namely,
as a negated I proposition). In fact, Aristotle seems to use the form ‘Some S is not P’ as
the form of a (quantitatively definite) O proposition only in cases where, on the basis of
the context, the quantity of the proposition is not only determined, but it is also deter-
mined that S exists.193
3. A is a particular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form I (α, β) (in
words: some β is an α) if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in which A
is a true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if some
concept (e.g., the concept of an α that is a β) – call it γ or δ or whatever – can be
formed for which it holds that: there is an object that falls under it, and it is the
case both that this object falls under the concepts α and β, as well as that every

passed down. In his edition, Ross follows, against all MSS, Alexander of Aphrodisias, who brings to
the text an older manuscript which omits these genitives. They are to be understood as commentarial
additions to the original.
The view of Hermann Weidemann (see the remarks in his edition of Aristotle’s writing Peri Her-
meneias: Aristotle 2002, 208) that Aristotle supposes a statement of the form ‘not every S is P’ implies
a statement ‘some S is not P’, which is incompatible with the above observation, relies on a transla-
tion which seems to me to incompletely render and thus to distort the sense of An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b
15–16. That passage is not concerned with such an implication, but rather with the fact that if there is
a quantitatively indefinite negative premise (‘B does not belong to some C’), it is true in both mean-
ings (both in the particular as well as in the universal meaning), so that it is thus true “both if B
belongs to no C, as well as if it does not belong to every C,” and indeed “because B does not belong to
some C” (ὅτι τινὶοὐχ ὑπάϱχει). With Weidemann’s translation, which represents the ὅτι-clause as a
‘that’-clause, it becomes redundant, as he concedes. As a ‘that’-clause, it states what is already stated
in a previous part of the sentence, namely in the nominal expression ‘τὸ[. . .] ὑπάϱχειν’.

Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

object which falls under this concept falls under the concepts α and β; (2) A is false
if and only if N A (= E (α, β)) is true and NN A is false (so that, if some object which
falls under the concept γ or δ or whatever other concept falls under one of the
concepts α and β, this object does not fall under the other of these concepts).
Corollary to definition 3: If a proposition of the form I (α, β) is true, then a con-
cept γ – for example, the concept of a β that is an α – can be formed194 such that the
following holds: some individual falls under the concept γ, and this individual with
predicate γ is a β, and there is no γ that does not fall under the concept α. If by
contrast a proposition of the form I (α, β) is false, this means, according to definition
3, that a proposition of the form N I (α, β) is true and that, if some individual which
falls under an arbitrary concept γ also falls under one of the two concepts α and β,
this individual γ then does not fall under the other of these two concepts.
Scholium: The last sentence of the corollary to definition 3 determines the mean-
ing of the logical constant E (. . ., . . .). This determination corresponds to the discus-
sion in which Aristotle explains this meaning. (See An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30.)
4. A is a singular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form Ạ(α, β) (in
words: that β is an α) if and only if, for any interpretation of α and β in which A is a
true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if there is some
object β to which the predicate α belongs, and this object is the same as that object β
which is discussed in Ạ(α, β) and in the context of Ạ(α, β) (in case there is such a
context); (2) A is false if and only if N A (= Ẹ(α, β)) is true or β is an empty concept.
Scholium: Impredicative propositions like ‘It is raining’ are usually understood
as non-categorical propositions, but they can as a rule be understood as proposi-
tions which are singular categorical propositions in disguise. Thus, the proposition
‘It is raining’ is about the weather and states roughly: ‘This weather – the weather
being discussed or that is supposed to be discussed – is rainy weather.’
5. A is a limitative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form Y (Nα, β), with Y = A,
Y = I, or Y = Ạ, (in words: every or some or that β is a not-α) if and only if, for any
interpretation of the concept variables α and β in which A is a true or false propo-
sition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if the predicate β is not an
empty concept and N Ζ (α, β), with Ζ = I, Ζ = A, or Ζ = Ạ, is a true proposition
whose quantity is the same as that of the proposition Y (Nα, β), and (2) A is false if
and only if N A is true or β is an empty concept.
For illustration by way of example, one can insert for α, β, and γ in sequence the concept
words ‘white’, ‘horse’, and ‘white horse [Schimmel]’.

§ 53 Basic Rules
The basic rules from which all the rules of the categorical syllogistic are derived, and
which are treated in these paragraphs, rest on the meanings of the logical constants
A ( ), I ( ), Ạ( ), and N( ), which are determined in the definitions established in § 52.
More precisely, rule (III. 1) corresponds to definition 2 (1). Rules (III. 2) and (III. 3) cor-
respond to the second and first sentences, respectively, in the corollary to definition
3. Rule (III. 4) corresponds to the corollary to definition 2. Rule (III. 5) corresponds to
definition 1 (2), rule (III. 6) to definition 3 (2). The validity of (III. 7) arises from defini-
tion 4, while the validity of rules (III. 8) to (III. 10) results from definition 5.
If α, β, and γ are concept variables, then rules (III. 1) and (III. 2) are valid
(cf. Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30):
Dictum de omni:
A (α, β) : : I (β, β), H (I (β, γ), Ạ(α, γ))
(III. 1)
Dictum de nullo:
N I (α, β) : : H (I (β, γ), N Ạ(α, γ))
(III. 2)
Rules (III. 1) and (III. 2) also remain valid if the concept variable γ is replaced in
all places of its occurrence in the formulas which render these rules.
Let γ be a variable which occurs in no premise formula of the lines of a proof
which proceed the line in which one of the two following formulas (III. 3) and (III. 4)
stands. Then and only then does this formula express a valid rule:
First exposition rule:
I (α, β) ∴A (α, γ), Ạ(β, γ)
(III. 3)
Second exposition rule:
N A (α, β) ∴N I (α, γ), H (I (β, β), Ạ(β, γ))
(III. 4)
Scholium: Similarities may be noticed between the way Aristotle describes the opera-
tion he designate as ἔκϑεσις (“exposition”) and the way he expresses, in An. pr. 1. 1,
24 b 28–30 (1989, 2), what the logical constants ‘predicated of every’ and ‘predicated
of none’ mean. Namely, to explain this meaning he uses the same Greek word for
“can be taken” (λαβεῖν) that he also uses for the expository procedure. He writes in
An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30: “We use the expression ‘[α is] predicated of every [β]’, when-
ever none of the things [e.g., γ] which fall under the subject-term [β] (μηδὲν τῶν τoῦ
ὑπoĸԑιμένoʋ)195 can be taken (λαβεῖν) of which the other term [α] cannot be said.
And we use ‘[α is] predicated of none [no β]’ likewise [that is, when no γ can be
Compare note 192.
182
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

taken of which α can be said].” What is meant here should be more clear from An.
pr. 1. 41. There (49 b 14–32 [1989, 57]), he says something more about the meaning of
‘α is predicated of all β’. He says that ‘A (α, β)’ means: “α belongs to everything to
which all β belongs.”196 This statement can be paraphrased in the following way: if
one only finds some example of those objects to which the predicate β belongs, and
designate it, e.g., as γ (so that I (β, γ) holds), then on the assumption that A (α, β) is
the case it also immediately holds that this γ is an α. That is, ‘A (α, β)’ means that no
concept, e.g., no concept γ, can be formed for which it would not at once also hold
that if some γ is a β, then this γ is an α; symbolically expressed: A (α, β) ∴H (I (β, γ),
Ạ(α, γ)). This corresponds to the dictum de omni in its above formulation (III. 1).
Contradiction rules of the logical square:
NN A (α, β) ∴A (α, β)
(III. 5)
NN I (α, β) ∴I (α, β)
(III. 6)
I call rules (III. 5) and (III. 6) contradiction rules, since they are equivalent to rules which,
together with certain other rules, express that two propositions of the form N A (α, β)
and A (α, β) or two propositions of the form N I (α, β) and I (α, β) are contradictory to
each other, respectively. These other rules do not need to be introduced explicitly
as basic rules, since their validity results from the validity of the more general
basic rules. These rules are the converse counterparts to (III. 5) and (III. 6), namely,
(1) A (α, β) ∴NN A (α, β) and
(2) I (α, β) ∴NN I (α, β),
thus cases of the direct application of rule (I. 1), from which – on the basis of (I. 4) –
in conjunction with (III. 5) or (III. 6) the rules A (α, β) ∴A (α, β) and I (α, β) ∴I (α,
β), respectively, are immediately derivable. From which in turn result – on the
basis of (I. 2) – the two following rules:
(3) N A (α, β) ∴N A (α, β) and
(4) N I (α, β) ∴N I (α, β).
If one takes ‘E (α, β)’ and ‘O (α, β)’ as abbreviations for ‘N I (α, β)’ and ‘N A (α, β)’, respec-
tively, then (3) and (4) can be understood as expressions that summarize the four contra-
diction rules of the logical square; to them the following formulas correspond:
N A (α, β) : : O (α, β) and
N I (α, β) : : E (α, β).
As according to Günther Patzig’s (1963, 43, n. 1) translation of this passage in the second edi-
tion of his book Die aristotelische Syllogistik.
2 Principles § 53
183

The remaining contradiction rules of the logical square, i.e.,
N O (α, β) : : A (α, β) and
N E (α, β) : : I (α, β),
are only transformations of rules (III. 5) and (III. 6), respectively, or the inverse
counterparts of (1) and (2).
Subalternation in the weak logical square:
Ạ(α, β) ∴I (α, β)
(III. 7)
As for the remaining rules of the logical square, they can all be taken as derived
rules of the categorical syllogistic (see § 54 below).
Basic rules of the limitative proposition:
A (Nα, β) ∴N I (α, β)
(III. 8)
I (Nα, β) ∴N A (α, β)
(III. 9)
Ạ(Nα, β) ∴N Ạ(α, β)
(III. 10)
According to these rules, a negative proposition follows logically from a limitative
proposition of the same quantity if the subject concepts of both propositions con-
cur and the predicate concept of the limitative proposition is the antonym of the
predicate concept of the negative proposition (see also Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 46, 51 b
41–52 a 5). Incidentally, the validity of an inference does not change at all when a
positive concept expression is replaced in all places of its occurrence with a nega-
tive concept expression of the form Nα.
3 Derived Rules
§ 54 Rules of the Strong and Weak Logical Squares
With the division of the rules of the logical square which Aristotle treats in De
interpretatione 7 and An. pr. 2. 15 into basic rules ((III. 5) to (III. 7)) and derived
rules ((III. 11) to (III. 16)), I do not claim to be presenting an Aristotelian division.
Yet it can be supposed that Aristotle was familiar with the six rules which I will use
here to derive rules (III. 11) to (III. 16). These are the rules (I. 1), (I. 2), (I. 4), (I. 5), (II. 2),
and (II. 6). As for rule (I. 1), it is in substance simply a summary of rules of the logical
square. Concerning Aristotle’s acquaintance with the rule of modus ponendo ponens
184
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

(II. 2), I refer the reader to my remark on this rule in § 48.197 Concerning his
acquaintance with the four metalogical rules (I. 2), (I. 4), (I. 5), and (II. 6), though
the observance of the syllogistic method of proof, and with this the general use
of the metalogical rules in the school of Aristotle, is well-documented (see § 41
above), there is a lack of investigation into the manner and extent to which Aris-
totle’s Prior Analytics show clear traces of the application of these rules. This is
especially true of the application of rules (I. 4) and (I. 5), which follow from the
synthetic theorem, i.e., the Peripatetic inference chain rule (I. 3), as well as the
idempotency rule (II. 6). Rule (I. 2) is used explicitly by Aristotle under the name
of ἀπαγωγὴεἰς τὸἀδύνατον.

Ạ(α, β)’ can be abbreviated by ‘Ẹ(α, β)’ and ‘N A (α, β)’ by ‘O (α, β)’, rule (III. 12)
expresses that a proposition of the form O (α, β) is related as subaltern to a propo-
sition of the form Ẹ(α, β).
Although Theodor Ebert believes that modus ponendo ponens is for Aristotle “not a valid syl-
logistic mode” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 329), he also supposes that Aristotle makes use of this
inference form in his syllogistic. He attributes the fact that Aristotle does not explicitly draw at-
tention to this use to the “self-evident character of this form of consequence” (Ebert & Nortmann
2007, 329).

Contrariety:
The fact that there is a contrary relation between Ạ(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β), so that
two propositions of these forms can both be false but not both true, is the direct
result of the fact that, as per rule (I. 1), NN Ạ(α, β) follows logically from Ạ(α, β)
and that, as per § 53, def. 4 (2), Ạ(α, β) is false when N Ạ(α, β) is true, but both Ạ
(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β) are false in case β is an empty concept.

In (III. 14) are compressed three further rules of the logical square, which can be
immediately distinguished from each other if we replace ‘N I (α, β)’ with ‘E (α, β)’
and ‘N A (α, β)’ with ‘O (α, β)’. These rules are:
E (α, β) ∴O (α, β),
N I (α, β) ∴O (α, β), and
E (α, β) ∴N A (α, β).
The first of these three rules is another subalternation rule. The second along
with (III. 15) indicates the subcontrariety between I (α, β) and O (α, β), the third

does not need a derivation, since it depends on the immediate application of (I. 1).
The fact that the relationship between Ạ(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β) is not contradictory
is a result of the invalidity of the rule NN Ạ(α, β) ∴Ạ(α, β).

The rule derived in line [10] is different from modus Darapti (III. 30) in that it
does not bring only universal premises into play. The validity of (III. 17) thus does
not presuppose, as is sometimes supposed, the validity of Darapti.
Theodor Ebert, in his reconstruction of the Aristotelian proof of the validity of
I-conversion, assumes the convertibility of E propositions. In his reconstruction of the
(indirect) proof of the convertibility of E propositions, however, he carries out an
I-conversion on the basis of the supposition that I propositions have the form
(∃x) (A x & B x) and, because of the commutativity of the &-relation, are convert-
ible (see Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 235–38). According to this reconstruction, Aristotle
avoids a circle in the validity proof of E-conversion only because he (unlike how it
appears in his text) carries out two different proofs for the validity of I-conversion
and further helps himself to a theory (namely, modern quantification theory)
which he could not have known. The indirect proof for the validity of I-conversion
appears, according to this reconstruction, as an unnecessary detour.

Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

Scholium: The three conversion rules were proven by Aristotle in the same order
as above and in the same way, namely, indirectly.198
Since universally negative propositions are convertible, it can be proven simply
through subalternation that the rule N I (α, β) ∴N A (β, α) is valid as well. But this of
course does not allow us to say that also particular negative propositions are also
convertible. Rather, only E, I and A propositions are convertible, and the latter only
per accidens. This may be the simple reason why Aristotle only considers three rules
as conversion rules. Ebert, by contrast, sees the reason for this in the fact that Aris-
totle did not need “the convertibility of BeA to AoB” for the validity proofs of valid
modes in the second and third figures (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 238–39). It would be
more appropriate to say: Aristotle did not need the simple conversion of negative
universal propositions (with a subsequent subalternation) for these validity proofs.
§ 56 Categorical Syllogisms
1. Perfect syllogisms
The label ‘perfect syllogisms’ corresponds to a classification of inference rules
which goes back to Aristotle.199 Among modern interpreters, the reigning opinion
is that the perfection of syllogisms consists for Aristotle in their ‘self-evidence’,
and this self-evidence makes a derivation from more basic principles (like the dic-
tum de omni (III. 1) and the dictum de nullo (III. 2)) neither necessary nor possible.
For Robin Smith Aristotle’s distinction between perfect and imperfect syllogisms
concerns nothing but “the difference between a valid and an evidently valid argu-
ment” (Aristotle 1989, 110). Günther Patzig (1969, 51–93) has also attempted to offer
justification for this interpretation. He summarizes what a perfect syllogism is for
Aristotle with the following words:
[A] perfect inference is an inference in which the defined necessity is not only present but
rather ‘appears’ or becomes clear, while an imperfect inference may have this necessity as
well but still requires certain operations in order to make this necessity ‘appear’ or become
clear. In a word: perfect inferences are self-evident inferences. Accordingly, Aristotle also
calls ‘perfect’ syllogisms ‘apparent’ inferences. (Patzig 1969, 54)
Yet this opinion cannot be supported by Aristotle’s texts. According to the relevant
definition of the perfect syllogism in 1. 1, 24 b 22–26, perfect syllogisms are not
For the reconstruction of the proof, see M. Wolff 1998, 131–70.
Even though Aristotle often renders syllogisms with ‘if-then’-propositions, the view that for
Aristotle syllogisms are not propositions but rules can be defended on good grounds, though it is
disputed by Łukasiewicz and others. On this see, Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 220–25.

distinguished from imperfect syllogisms by their self-evidence, nor by a higher de-
gree of self-evidence, but rather only in that “in order to be evident” (πρὸς τὸϕανῆ-
ναι) they “require nothing else beyond what already has been supposed [with their
premises]” (παρὰτὰԑἰλημμένα).200 In other words: a syllogism is perfect when its
validity (i.e., when the necessity with which its conclusion follows from its prem-
ises) can be made clear without (as is necessary with imperfect syllogisms) taking
into consideration more than what is present with the premises which are assumed
to be true and their meaning.
This explanation of the perfect syllogism of course does not only exclude but
precisely assumes that the validity even of perfect syllogisms can be proved on the
basis of deeper principles. But such proof of validity must be distinguished essentially
from that of an imperfect syllogism. Imperfect syllogisms are proved by Aristotle
with reductio ad impossibile (according to rule (I. 2)), with exposition (according to
rule (III. 3) or (III. 4)) or with conversion (according to one of rules (III. 17) to (III. 19)).
All these proofs rely on using a supposition which does not belong among the prem-
ises of the syllogism that is to be proved. For: in order to carry out a proof with re-
ductio ad impossibile, one must bring into play a supposition which does not belong
to the syllogism to be proved; rather, it is the contradictory of the conclusion of the
syllogism to be proved, from which, in conjunction with one of its premises, the pre-
cise contradictory of the other premise follows. Exposition proofs as well can only be
carried out with the introduction of an additional supposition, for the application of
one of the exposition rules (III. 3) and (III. 4) is tied to the introduction of a concept
variable which does not occur anywhere among the variables of the inference rule
to be proved itself. Finally, conversions also rely on the introduction of an additional
supposition. As the above proofs for the validity of the conversion rules (III. 17) to
(III. 19) show, any application of one of these rules consists in the abbreviation of a
procedure in which, through exposition, an additional concept variable which does
not already occur in the formula to be converted is introduced, and then a reductio
ad impossibile still comes into play. By contrast, the validity proofs for perfect syllo-
gisms are carried out directly and exclusively from the premises that occur in them.
Namely, in order to see the validity of a perfect syllogism, it suffices to pay attention
to the meanings (as fixed by their definitions) of the logical constants which occur in
the premises of the syllogism. That is, it suffices here to make use of dictum de omni
et nullo, namely of basic rules (III. 1) and (III. 2), which in accordance with definitions
Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 22–26 (1984, 40): “I call perfect a deduction which needs nothing
other than what has been stated to make the necessity evident (πρὸς τὸϕανῆναɩ τὸἀναγκαῖον);
a deduction is imperfect if it needs [in addition] either one or more things [suppositions], which
are indeed the necessary consequences of the terms set down, but have not been [explicitly] as-
sumed in the propositions.”
190
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

2 and 3 in § 52 (or in accordance with the definitions which Aristotle introduced in
connection with his explanation of the perfect syllogism at the end of chapter 1 of
the first book of Analytica priora (24 b 28–30)) make explicit what it means for pre-
mises of the form A (α, β) or N I (α, β) to be true.
The distinction between perfect and imperfect syllogisms thus depends on an
underlying structural distinction in the validity proofs of perfect and imperfect
syllogisms. One can only see this structural distinction if one grasps what conver-
sion proofs depend on for Aristotle. If one believes with Ebert and other Aristotle
interpreters that I-conversion can only be explained on the basis of a modern
quantification theory (see my comment above to (III. 18)), one is blocked from un-
derstanding the distinction Aristotle describes between the perfection and imper-
fection of syllogisms.
Ebert supposes with Günther Patzig that perfect syllogisms distinguish them-
selves as self-evidently valid modes of inference through the “formulation of their
premises” and “the position of the middle term between the two extremes.”201 Yet
Aristotle nowhere explains the perfection of syllogisms through peculiarities of their
inner structure. Rather, he traces their perfection quite expressly back to the way
their validity is proved. Thus he says that syllogisms are perfect because they are “at
once” (εὐϑύς (An. pr. 1. 16, 36 a 6–7 [1989, 26])) “brought to completion [. . .] by means
of the initial premises” (An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b. 30)). In other places, he says of perfect syllo-
gisms that their validity is “evident from the definition” (ϕανερὸν ἐκ τοῦὁρισμοῦ
(14, 32 b 40 and 14, 33 a 24–25 [1989, 19–20])), namely from the definition of the logical
constants that occur in the premises; and he designates the derivation of their valid-
ity “from the definition” explicitly as “proof” (ἀπόδειξις (14, 33 a 27 and 15, 35 a 35)).
By contrast, he says of an imperfect syllogism “that it is imperfect is clear from the
proof” (16, 36 a 1). Syllogisms are imperfect because “the necessary result is brought
to completion not from the initial premises alone, but from others in addition” (1. 5,
27 a 16–17 [1989, 7]; cf. 28 a 5–7).
For this reason, treating perfect syllogisms as modes of inference whose valid-
ity requires no proof, as is typical in the recent Aristotle literature, does not con-
form to the views of Aristotle.

This derivation of Barbara from basic rule (III. 1) corresponds to the justification
which Aristotle indicates in An. pr. 1. 4, 25 b 37–40 for his supposition of the validity
of Barbara: this supposition relies on the meaning of the expression (i.e., the logical
constant) ‘. . . is said of every . . . ’. He gives an analogous justification in 25 b 40–26 a

From Barbara and Celarent, syllogisms of the modes Barbari and Celaront can be
derived by weakening the respective conclusion according to subalternation rules
(III. 13) and (III. 14). The same holds for all syllogisms with universal conclusions
that are derived in what follows.
Although the following two modes (III. 22) and (III. 23), i.e., Darii and Ferio, can
be derived from modes of the second figure, namely from Camestres (III. 25) and
Cesare (III. 24) respectively (see (III. 28) and (III. 29)), they can also count as perfect
syllogisms, since like Barbara and Celarent they can be derived directly from basic

rules (III. 1) and (III. 2), respectively (cf. An. pr. 1. 4, 26 a 17–23). This happens in the

(I. ) [, ]
Unlike the conclusion of Ferio, the conclusions of Barbara, Celarent, and Darii can
each be converted according to one of the rules (III. 17) to (III. 19). This is something
that Aristotle points out in An. pr. 3. 1, 53 a 3–14. Each of the modes of the tradition-
ally titled ‘fourth figure’, namely, Bamalip, Calemes, and Dimatis in turn, result from
these conversions. Modes of the fourth figure in which the conclusion is a particular
negative proposition, namely, Fesapo and Fresison, can be derived directly through
the conversion of the universal negative premise of a mode of the third figure.202
(See my remarks to (III. 31) and (III. 35) below.)
2. Imperfect syllogisms
Imperfect syllogisms are reduced in the Aristotelian syllogism to perfect syllo-
gisms through one of the three following operations: (1) by conversion (as per
(III. 17), (III. 18), or (III. 19)), with transposition of the terms that occur in them, (2)
by exposition (as per (III. 3), or (III. 4)), or (3) by indirect proof (that is, through
reductio ad absurdum as per (I. 2)).
(1) Conversion proofs all rely on rules whose validity depends on the validity
of exposition rule (III. 3) (see the proof of (III. 18)). Proofs by conversion – including
those by conversio per accidens – are to that extent indirectly proofs by exposition.
It is not the case, as Theodor Ebert believes, that through the premise conversion that Aristo-
tle describes in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27, “new” syllogisms “never” result from modes of the second
and third figure, but rather always only syllogisms already proven from the second and third
figure. See his commentary on An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27 in Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 347.
3 Derived Rules § 56
193

(2) Proofs by exposition, as the rules (III. 3) and (III. 4) show, rely essentially on the
introduction of a term which does not occur at all in the premises of the syllogism
whose validity is to be proved by exposition. (3) The third kind of proof, reductio ad
absurdum, belongs to the type of indirect proofs; these can only be carried out by
introducing an additional premise in the argumentation, namely, the negation of the
conclusion. – Since no other than these three kinds of proof must be brought into
play, it is entirely appropriate and understandable when Aristotle defines syllogisms
called ‘imperfect’ as deductions which are distinguished from perfect syllogisms not,
say, by a lack of self-evidence, but rather because in order to be self-evident this kind
of syllogism “needs [in addition] either one or more things [suppositions], which are
indeed the necessary consequences of the terms set down, but have not been [explic-
itly] assumed in the propositions” (I. 1, 24 b. 24–26 [1984, 40]).

The fact already remarked by Aristotle (An. pr. 1. 7, 29 b 6–15) that Darii and Ferio
can both be derived from modes of the second figure, namely from Camestres
and Cesare respectively, whose validity in each case depends on the validity of

Celarent, shows that imperfect syllogisms which are reducible to Darii or Ferio
are further reducible to Celarent.

For the three kinds of proof that Aristotle mentions for the validity of Darapti, see
An. pr. 1. 6, a 28–25. But he sketches there only the proofs by conversion and expo-
sition. That there is a proof by reductio ad impossibile he only claims.
Scholium: Since these proofs are valid, the criticism put forth by Hilbert and
Ackermann on the syllogistic treatment of Darapti (see § 17 above) comes to
nought. The evidence offered by Bertrand Russell in his essay “The Philosophy of
Logical Atomism” is unable to support the (certainly correct) claim in the last sen-
tence of the following quotation, when he writes:
196
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

I want to say emphatically that general propositions are to be interpreted as not
involving existence. [. . .] This notion, of course, of general propositions not involving
existence is one which is not in the traditional doctrine of the syllogism. In the tradi-
tional doctrine of the syllogism it was assumed that when you have such a statement
as “All Greeks are men,” that implies that there are Greeks, and this produced falla-
cies. For instance, “All chimeras are animals, and all chimeras breath flame, there-
fore some animals breathe flame.” This is a syllogism in Darapti, but that mood of
the syllogism is fallacious, as this instance shows. That was a point, by the way,
which had a certain historical interest, because it impeded Leibniz in his attempts to
construct a mathematical logic. He [. . .] was always failing because of his respect for
Aristotle. Whenever he invented a really good system, as he did several times, it al-
ways brought out that such moods as Darapti are fallacious. If you say “All A is B and
all A is C, therefore some B is C” – if you say this you incur a fallacy, but he could not
bring himself to believe that it was fallacious, so he began again. That shows you
should not have too much respect for distinguished men. (Russell, 1919a, 190–91, my
emphasis)

The first two lines already present an indirect proof for Bocardo (III. 34), which is
described by Aristotle as a proof per impossibile in An. pr. 1. 6, 28 b 17–20. Disamis
and Datisi can be proved in a similar way. In these cases, however, Celarent (III. 21)
rather than Barbara (III. 20) is the point of departure. Aristotle points out in An. pr.
1. 6, 28 b 7–25 that Disamis and Datisi are to be proved by conversion or ekthesis as
well. This can be done as follows.
By conversion of the first premise according to rule (III. 17) a mode of the so-
called fourth figure (traditionally called Fesapo) can be derived from Felapton,
which Aristotle points out in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27.

As lines [1] and [2] show, this proof depends on exposition. Aristotle claims that
such a proof for Bocardo is possible in An. pr. 1. 6, 28 b 17–21. However, he does not
give a more precise description of this proof. Instead, he only sketches there the
proof per impossibile, which was already contained in the indirect proof for Felap-
ton. (See my remarks to (III. 31) above.)

This proof by conversion corresponds to the proof sketched by Aristotle in An.
pr. 1. 6, 28 b 33–35.
By conversion of the first premise, according to rule (III. 17), a mode of the so-
called fourth figure, traditionally called Fresison, can be derived from Ferison, as
Aristotle indicates in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27.
However, Aristotle speaks neither of a fourth figure nor of modes, since the
order of premises is irrelevant for his system.

In Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Pyrrhonism II, 163–66 [2000, 11–12]) a syllogism is
discussed as an example of the “categorical syllogisms” which “were especially
used by the Peripatetics,” which corresponds to rule (III. 36):
“Socrates is a human being;
All human beings are animals;
So Socrates is an animal.”
Syllogisms of this type, which Aristotle did not yet explicitly address, were treated
in more detail by medieval logicians, e.g., by William of Ockham. He discusses the
syllogism mentioned by Sextus in Summa Logicae (1957, III 1. 20; 41 rb).

§ 57 Universally Valid Propositional Schemata
Through conditionalization, according to (II. 28), all universally valid rules of cat-
egorical inference can be transformed into universally valid propositional sche-
mata. Thus, e.g., from (III. 18) the schema
✶∴H (I (α, β), I (β, α))
(III. 42)
or from (III. 20) the schema
✶∴H (A (α, β), H (A (β, γ), A (α, γ)))
(III. 43)
can be derived. I will spare myself the simple proofs for the universal validity of
these two propositional schemata.
By contrast, formulas like
✶∴I (β, β), ✶∴Ạ(β, β) or ✶∴A (β, β)
3 Derived Rules § 57
201

are neither derivable from the principles established above, nor do such formulas
for their part express principles which would have to be assumed as valid within
the categorical syllogistic. At best, formulas are derivable in which a tautological
expression occurs as a sub-formula, for example:
✶∴H (I (α, β), A (β, β)).
(III. 44)
This formula is derivable, because the following rule is derivable.
I (α, β) ∴A (β, β)
(III. 45)
Proof:

On the basis of (III. 45) the following formulas are derivable as well, as can be
easily understood:
✶∴H (Ạ(α, β), A (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (A (α, β), A (β, β)),
(III. )

(III. )
✶∴H (I (α, β), Ạ(β, β)) and
(III. )
✶∴H (Ạ(α, β), Ạ(β, β)).
(III. )
The fact that tautological propositions of the categorical form A (α, α), I (α, α) or Ạ
(α, α) do not need to be assumed as true within the elementary syllogistic is to be
construed as the expression of a deeper-seated logical sitation. Namely, the truth of
an affirmative categorical proposition depends on whether the concepts to which its
terms relate are satisfied or empty (see § 53, scholium to def. 1). Thus, for any inter-
pretation one gives to expressions of the form A (α, α), I (α, α) or Ạ(α, α), it depends
on the content of the concept for which the concept variable α stands whether it is a
true or false. A proposition of the form A (α, α) can accordingly be false, if the con-
cept α is empty. If one supposes that a proposition of this form is analytic, there
are – against a widespread conviction – analytic propositions which are false.

Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

Section Four
Modal Syllogistic
1 Preliminary Remark
In view of the main aim of Part II of this essay, namely in view of the reduction of
the calculus of functions to syllogistic principles and to a triad of postulates that
are not strictly universally valid, this section is superfluous, since that calculus
contains no modal expressions. Nevertheless, I would like to show in this section
how the method pursued above for deriving syllogistic rules can be consistently
and successfully maintained in the modal syllogistic; and that the basic rules on
which the modal syllogistic relies agree with a common use of the relevant modal
expressions and can be rendered in the language of the elementary syllogistic,
i.e., in a language which, on the one hand, is restricted to the use of the syllogistic
vocabulary standardized above, but, on the other hand, is suitable and rich
enough to render universally valid rules of modal logic, which are also used im-
plicitly in the modern modal-logical systems developed in the framework of the
calculus of functions (as shown in Appendix 5).
Concerning the syllogistic vocabulary, in order to make Aristotle’s validity
claims verifiable and his argumentation replicable, I need no other logical con-
stants to render de re modalities (as per § 6) than those that represent de dicto
modalities. It will also turn out to be unnecessary to distinguish modalities of var-
ious strengths (as they occur, e.g., in ∃x (A x & □B x) and ∃x □(A x & □B x)). In
this way, the Aristotelian modal logic is shown to be a system of rules of greater
unity and uniformity than all the modern presentations and reconstruction at-
tempts known to me concede to it.203
The definitions established in § 59 give the modal expressions appearing in
this system (‘necessarily’, ‘possibly’, etc.) a uniform formal semantics, which
agrees with their natural usage but also comes at least very close to the semantics
of modal expressions suggested by Aristotle. In § 60, basic rules which result from
these definitions are established. On the basis of these rules, as well as the rules

§ 58 Notation
In this section, I will continue to use the signs which I introduced in § 42, § 46,
and § 51; new logical constants will be added as well: ‘L . . .’, ‘M . . .’, and ‘K . . .’
(as in § 13 and § 14). Their meaning will be fixed in the definitions of the following
paragraphs.
§ 59 Definitions
1. A is a formula of the modal syllogistic if and only if A satisfies one of the follow-
ing conditions: (a) A is a formula of the categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive
syllogistic (in the sense of § 47 or § 52), or (b) A renders the form of an apodictic,
problematic, or contingent proposition.
2. A is an apodictic proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form L B (in words: neces-
sarily (it is true that) B), if and only if, for every interpretation in which B and C
are true or false, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if, firstly, B is not
false in any thinkable circumstances, but rather true in all thinkable circumstan-
ces; secondly, any proposition C which follows regularly from B is likewise not
false in any thinkable circumstances, but rather true in all thinkable circumstan-
ces; and, thirdly, if B is a categorical proposition, A satisfies the truth conditions as
per one of the following definitions 5, 6, and 7; (2) A is false if and only if there is
some thinkable circumstance in which B is false, thus if it is possibly true that N B.
3. A is a problematic proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form M B (in words:
possibly (it is true that) B), if and only if, for every interpretation in which B is a
true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if, firstly, B
is not necessarily false and, secondly, if B is a categorical proposition, A satisfies
In the space of this essay, I can engage only very limitedly with the extensive interpretive
literature on Aristotle. Hence, as much as possible, I leave philological questions out of consider-
ation. In addition, I largely restrict myself to the reconstruction of Aristotelian validity proofs; I
delve into the invalidity proofs, carried out in the Analytics using sample propositions, only inso-
far as their demonstrative force is contested in the literature.

the truth conditions as per one of the following definitions 8, 9, and 10; (2) A is
false if and only if N B is necessarily true.
4. A is a contingent proposition, i.e., A is equivalent to K B (in words: contingently
(it is true that) B), if and only if, for every interpretation in which B is true or
false, the following holds: A is true if and only if, firstly, B is a categorical proposi-
tion of the form Y (α, β), with Y equivalent to A, I, or Ạ, or a categorical proposi-
tion of the form Z (α, β), with Z equivalent to N Y; secondly, Y (α, β) satisfies the
truth conditions as per one of definitions 11, 12, and 13; and thirdly, it is both pos-
sibly true that Y (α, β) as well as possibly true that Z (α, β), so that if Y = A, then
Z = I, if Y = I, then Z = A, and if Y = Ạ, then Z = Ạ.
Scholium: According to this definition, K B is not equivalent to the truth of
both M B and MN B. According to definition 4, contingency is defined only for
categorical propositions and such that K B is equivalent to the truth of both M B
and MN B, and both B as well as N B are categorical propositions of the same
quantity. The statement in which Aristotle defines contingency (see An. pr. 1. 13,
32 a 18–20 [1989, 17–18]; compare § 6, footnote 40) can be understood in a similar
way. To be sure, this definition is often taken as if Aristotle equates the contin-
gent in general with that which is neither necessary nor impossible. But this
conception is not quite correct. Instead, Aristotle says that he uses “to be contin-
gent” and “what is contingent” for that which is not necessary, but when “noth-
ing impossible will result if it is put as being the case.” For “put as being the
case” Aristotle uses a word (ὑπάϱχειν) here which he typically pertains to predi-
cates. Accordingly, he can be understood as saying that it is really predicates to
which the property of being contingent would be attributed, and that proposi-
tions are only contingent insomuch as contingent predicates are stated in them.
He seems to treat a predicate as contingent if and only if it is a predicate that
either both possibly applies as well as possibly does not apply to every or to
some or to one specific exemplar of a certain kind.205
Aristotle pointed out that the logical form of contingent negative propositions,
i.e., the form KN B, deviates from the logical form of typical negative propositions,
i.e., of the form N B, and from the form of problematic negative propositions, i.e., of
the form MN B, insofar as it actually is an “affirmative form” (An. pr. 1. 3, 25 b 20–21
[1989, 4]); it basically expresses an affirmation as in “is not-good” (An. pr. 1. 3, 25 b
Patzig (1969, 71) thus misunderstands the meaning of ‘K . . .’ when he takes the proposition
‘K [all women are taller than 1.9 m]’ as true and consequently Barbara XKM (see rule (IV. 90)
below) as invalid.

21–14 [1989, 4]).206 An example can make clear what is meant here: the proposition
‘It holds contingently of every mammal that it does not sleep’ and the equivalent
proposition ‘Every mammal contingently does not sleep’ mean that every mammal
can both sleep and not sleep. That every mammal can not sleep in this context
means precisely not that no mammal can sleep, but rather only that every mam-
mal is capable of not sleeping, or is just as capable of not-sleeping as of sleeping.
Hence, just like affirmative and limitative propositions, i.e., propositions of the form
Y (Nα, β), contingent negative propositions have a qualitative existential import.
5. A is an apodictic universal affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form
L A (α, β) (in words: necessarily (it is true that) every β is an α), if and only if, for
every interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false, the following holds: A
is true if and only if β is a non-empty concept (so that some object which falls
under the concept β is a β) and it is the case that if some object – whether it falls
under an arbitrary concept γ or δ or whatever other concept – falls under the
concept β, this object necessarily falls under the concept α.
Comment: Definition 5 is distinguished, as are the following definitions 6 to
13, from all the definitions up to this point by not introducing any new logical
constant. The reason for this is a merely technical one, pertaining to the presenta-
tion. I didn’t want to impede the comprehension of definitions 2 to 4 with the
nesting of additional sub-clauses. Such a nesting would have been necessary
wherever reference was made to definitions 5 to 13 in these earlier definitions.
The fact that definition 5 does not introduce any new logical constant means
that the logical form of apodictic universal affirmative propositions is not distin-
guished from the logical form of other apodictic affirmative propositions inasmuch
as the truth conditions specified in definition 2 hold for all apodictic propositions.
Special truth conditions for universal affirmative propositions must thus be specified
only inasmuch as the definition of universal affirmative propositions, as they are
found above in § 52, does not yet explain how modalization affects these proposi-
tions. That is, definition 2 in § 52 does not explain by itself what it means for the
expression it defines, ‘A (α, β)’, to be connected to the logical constant ‘L . . .’. The
following definitions 6 to 13 are required for the construction of a modal categorical
syllogistic for exactly the same kind of reason.
The fact that in definitions 5 to 13 no new logical constant is introduced also
means that, logically speaking, it makes no difference whether expressions of ne-
cessity, possibility and contingency are used de dicto or de re. That is, logically
speaking there is no difference between expressions of the form ‘it is necessarily

282–86).

true that . . . β is an α’ and sentences of the form ‘. . . β is necessarily an α’, and
likewise there is no difference between analogously formed expressions in which
an expression such as ‘possibly’ or ‘contingently’ is substituted for ‘necessarily’.
6. A is an apodictic particular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form
L I (α, β) (in words: necessarily (it is true that) some β is an α), if and only if, for
every interpretation of α and β in which A is a true or false proposition, the follow-
ing holds: (1) A is true if and only if some concept (e.g., the concept of a β that is an
α) – call it γ or δ or whatever else – can be formed for which it holds that: there is
an object that falls under this concept, such that this object necessarily falls under
the concept α or necessarily under the concept β; (2) A is false if and only if it holds
that, if some object – whether it falls under an arbitrary concept γ or δ or whatever
else – possibly falls under one of the two concepts α and β, then this object possibly
does not fall under the other of these two concepts α and β.
7. A is an apodictic singular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form
L Ạ(α, β) (in words: necessarily (it is true that) that β is an α), if and only if, for
every interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false, the following holds:
(1) A is true if and only if some β is necessarily an α and this very β is identical
with that object β which is discussed in A and in the context of A (in case there is
such a context); (2) A is false if and only if a concept (e.g., the concept of a β that
is an α) – call it γ or δ or whatever else – can be formed for which it holds that:
either there is no object which falls under the concepts γ and δ, or there is such
an object, and this object is identical with the one discussed in A and (where ap-
plicable) the context of A, but it possibly does not fall under the concept α.
8. A is a problematic universal affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form
M A (α, β) (in words: possibly (it is true that) every β is an α), if and only if, for every
interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false, the following holds: (1) A is true
if and only if α and β are non-empty concepts (so that some object that falls under
the concept α is an α, and some object that falls under the concept β is a β) and it
holds that, if some object – whether it falls under an arbitrary concept γ or δ or what-
ever else – possibly falls under the concept β, this object also possibly falls under the
concept α; (2) A is false if and only if some concept (e.g., the concept of a β that is not
an α) – call it γ or δ or whatever else – can be formed for which it holds that: there is
an object that falls under it such that this object falls under the concept β, and neces-
sarily none of the objects which likewise falls under it fall under the concept α.
9. A is a problematic particular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the
form M I (α, β) (in words: possibly (it is true that) some β is an α), if and only if, for
every interpretation of α and β in which A is a true or false proposition, the follow-
ing holds: (1) A is true if and only if α and β are non-empty concepts (so that some

object that falls under the concept α is an α, and some object that falls under the
concept β is a β), and some concept – call it γ or δ or whatever else – can be formed
for which it holds that: there is some object that falls under it, such that this object
both possibly falls under the concept α and possible falls under the concept β; (2) A
is false if and only if, if some object – whether it falls under an arbitrary concept γ
or δ or whatever else – possibly falls under one of the two concepts α and β, then
this object necessarily does not also fall under the other of these two concepts.
10. A is a problematic singular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the
form M Ạ(α, β) (in words: possibly (it is true that) that β is an α), if and only if, for
every interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false, the following holds:
(1) A is true if and only if some β is possibly an α and this very α is identical with
the object β which is discussed in A and in the context of A (if there is such a con-
text); (2) A is false if and only if an arbitrary concept – call it γ or δ or whatever
else – can be formed for which it holds that: either there is no object that falls
under the concepts β and γ, or there is such an object, and this very object is iden-
tical to that object β discussed in A and (if applicable) the context of A, but it neces-
sarily does not fall under the concept α.
11. A is a contingent universal proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form K Χ (α, β),
with Χ equal to A or N I (in words: contingently (it is true that) every β is (not) an
α), if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false,
the following holds: A is true if and only if α and β are non-empty concepts (so
that some object that falls under the concept α is an α, and some object that falls
under the concept β is a β), and it holds that, if some object – whether it falls
under the concept γ or δ or whatever else – falls under the concept β, this object
also contingently falls under the concept α.
12. A is a contingent particular proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form K Χ (α, β),
with Χ equal to I or N A (in words: contingently (it is true that) some β is (not) an α),
if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in which A is a true or false propo-
sition, the following holds: A is true if and only if some concept – call it γ or δ or
whatever else – can be formed for which it holds that: there is some object that
falls under it, and it is true both that this very object possibly falls under the con-
cept α and possibly falls under the concept β, and that it possibly does not fall
under the concept α and possibly does not fall under the concept β.
13. A is a contingent singular proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form K Χ (α, β),
with Χ equal to Ạor N Ạ(in words: contingently (it is true that) that β is an α), if
and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in which A is true or false, the
following holds: A is true if and only if some concept – call it γ or δ or whatever
else – can be formed, for which it holds that: there is an object that falls under it

and under the concept β and which is identical to that object which is discussed
in A and in the context of A, and it is true that this very object possibly falls
under the concept α, but also possibly does not fall under the concept α. –
– General Comment on These Definitions: Aristotle assumes in his modal syllo-
gistic as well as in his assertoric syllogistic that there are definitions (ὁϱισμοί) for
the logical constants which appear in the relevant syllogisms. For without such def-
initions there are, in his view, no perfect syllogisms (see my preliminary comment
to § 56, Section I, and § 63, Section II). Of course, we find at best hints at the content
of these definitions in the Analytica priora. This is even more true of the modal syl-
logistic than of the assertoric, where at least the meanings of ‘A . . . .’ And ‘E . . .’ are
explained clearly enough (see above § 52, scholium to def. 2). Sufficiently clear eluci-
dations are absent for ‘L . . .’, ‘M . . .’, and ‘K . . .’. We must thus decipher the mean-
ing that Aristotle wants to give these expressions largely from their use. Aristotle’s
neglect in this matter as well as the sketchiness of his presentation in many details
can probably only be explained by the fact that the text of Book I of the Analytica
priora “according to all we know” belongs to the kind of lecture manuscript which
was intended as a “sourcebook for teaching” in which “much could be made up for
with oral elucidations” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 419). Precisely in the case of the def-
initions a corresponding approach may have suggested itself. For in the framework
of a lecture it is much less helpful to read out an exact, complete definition from the
manuscript than, on a case-by-case basis, to give short relevant hints for grasping
certain aspects of a word’s meaning. Concerning the meaning of ‘L . . .’, we find such
a hint, e.g., in An. pr. 1. 8, 30 a 2–3 (1989, 13), where Aristotle suggests that the logical
vocabulary in assertoric and apodictic universal propositions can be interpreted “in
a similar way.” At the same time, Aristotle warns of failing to notice that analogies
between assertoric and apodictic propositions do not hold completely exactly but
rather only “approximately” (σχεδόν) (8, 29 b 36–37). We find a somewhat more ex-
tensive hint regarding the meanings of ‘M . . .’ and ‘K . . .’ at the beginning of
An. pr. 1. 13, 32 a 18–21 (1989, 17–18). He states: “I use the expressions ‘to be possible’
(ἐνδέχεσϑαι) and ‘what is possible’ (ἐνδεχόμενον) in application to something if it is
not necessary (ἀναγκαῖον) but nothing impossible (ἀδύνατον) will result if it is put as
being the case (ὑπάϱχειν) (for it is only equivocally that we say that what is neces-
sary (ἀναγκαῖον) is possible (ἐνδέχεσϑαι).” It is here indicated that M A follows logi-
cally from L A (see the following rule (IV. 1)), but only if ‘M . . .’ is not used in the
sense of ‘K . . .’. Accordingly, after this indication Aristotle gives a series of more
concrete hints on the distinct applications of ‘M . . .’ and ‘K . . .’ to affirmative
and negative statements and on the application of the negation sign to ‘M . . .’
and ‘K . . .’ (An. pr. 1. 13, 32 a 21–b 3). Hints on the modes of conversion for proposi-
tions which deal with what is “said to be possible” (ἐνδέχεσϑαι) (and indeed “the
2 Principles § 59
209

way that we define what is possible” (καϑ’ ὃν τϱόπον διοϱίζομεν τὸἐνδεχόμενον)),
are anticipated by Aristotle already in An. pr. 1. 3, 25 b 14 ff. (1989, 3–4).
§ 60 Basic Rules
1. Universally valid rules which rely on definition 2 in § 59:
A necesse esse ad esse valet consequentia:
L B ∴B
(IV. 1)
L B, H (B, C) ∴L C
(IV. 2)
2. Universally valid intermodal rules which rely on definitions 2 and 3 in § 59:
M B : : NLN B
(IV. 3)
NM B : : LN B
(IV. 4)
L B : : NMN B
(IV. 5)
NL B : : MN B
(IV. 6)
Aristotle points to rules (IV. 3) and (IV. 4) in An. pr. 1. 13, 32 a 25–27 and 22–24, re-
spectively. He formulates a rule corresponding to (IV. 5) in An. pr. 1. 16, 37 a 9 ff.
3. Universally valid rules which rely on definition 4 in § 59:
Let Y be a sign which in all places of its occurrence within one of the formulas (IV. 7)
and (IV. 8) is replaced by one of the signs A, I, or Ạ, and Z be a sign which in all places
of its occurrence within these formulas is replaced by N I, N A, or N Ạ, so that in this
formula Z = N I if Y = A, and Z = N A if Y = I, and finally Z = N Ạif Y = Ạ; then these
formulas each represent a valid rule:
K Y (α, β) : : M Y (α, β), M Z (α, β)
(IV. 7)
K Z (α, β) : : M Y (α, β), M Z (α, β)
(IV. 8)
We can render K A (α, β) and KN I (α, β) according to rules (IV. 7) and (IV. 8) with ‘for
every β it is possible both to be an α and not to be an α’. Similarly, K I (α, β) and KN
(α, β) can be rendered with ‘for some β it is possible both to be an α and not to be an α’.
Often, the meaning of K A is equated with the meaning of the conjunction of
M A and MN A. But this equation does not comport in all circumstances with the
use, within and outside of logic, of expressions like ‘It is contingently true that . . .’
and ‘contingently’. Nor does it comport exactly with the Aristotelian use (see § 59,
def. 4, scholium). The meaning of K A coincides with the conjunction of premises
M A and MN A only if both A and N A stand for expressions of categorical proposi-
tions of the same quantity (with qualitative existential import). Moreover, the
210
Part II Section Four Modal Syllogistic

grammatical form of these propositions in some languages (e.g, in German) must
be standardized in an appropriate way (see § 6 above). For example, if A repre-
sents a universal proposition of the form ‘every β is an α’, N A must stand for a
proposition of the grammatically homogenous form ‘every β is not an α’. The nega-
tion of A is in this case neither the (particular) proposition ‘not every β is an α’, nor
the (universal) proposition ‘no β is an α’. Otherwise, K A and the conjunction of
M A and MN A are not equivalent. The same holds for the case in which K A is a
particular proposition. In this case, it is equivalent to the conjunction of ‘M [some β
is an α]’ and ‘M [some β is not an α]’. That is, MN A stands here neither for ‘M [no β
is an α]’ nor for ‘M [not every β is an α]’. The simple equation of K A and the con-
junction of M A and MN A, as one can see, assumes a specific grammar and is logi-
cally misleading.
4. Modal-syllogistic versions of the dictum de omni which depend in turn on the
definitions 5, 8, 11, and 13 in § 59:
The following rules (IV. 9) to (IV. 11) are valid for arbitrary γ and also remain
valid if the concept variable γ is replaced by an arbitrary concept variable in all
places of its occurrence in the formula which expresses one of these rules:
L A (α, β) : : I (β, β), H (I (β, γ), L Ạ(α, γ))
(IV. 9)
M A (α, β) : : I (α, α), I (β, β), H (M I (β, γ), M Ạ(α, γ))
(IV. 10)
K A (α, β) : : I (α, α), I (β, β), H (I (β, γ), M Ạ(α, γ)),
H (I (β, γ), MN Ạ(α, γ))
(IV. 11)
5. Modal-syllogistic versions of the dictum de nullo which depend on the defini-
tions 6 and 9 in § 59:
The following rules (IV. 12) to (IV. 14) are valid for arbitrary γ and also remain
valid if the concept variable γ is replaced by an arbitrary concept variable in all
places of its occurrence in the formula which expresses one of these rules:
NL I (α, β) : : H (M I (β, γ), MN Ạ(α, γ))
(IV. 12)
NM I (α, β) : : H (M I (β, γ), LN Ạ(α, γ))
(IV. 13)
NM I (α, β) : : H (M I (β, β), LN Ạ(α, β))
(IV. 14)
6. Modal syllogistic exposition rules which depend in turn on definitions 6, 8, 9,
and 12 in § 59:
Let γ be a variable which occurs in no premise formula in the lines of proof pre-
ceding the line in which one of the formulas (IV. 15) to (IV. 18) stand; then this
formula expresses a valid rule (otherwise, the rule is only valid if the variable γ is
replaced by another concept variable in all places of its occurrence in the formula
expressed by one of these rules):
2 Principles § 60

L I (α, β) : : D (D (L Ạ(β, γ), L Ạ(α, γ)), NH (L Ạ(α, γ), NL Ạ(β, γ))),
H (L Ạ(β, γ), H (L Ạ(α, γ), L Ạ(β, γ))),
H (L Ạ(α, γ), H (L Ạ(β, γ), L Ạ(α, γ)))
(IV. 15)
NM A (α, β) ∴LN I (α, γ), Ạ(β, γ))
(IV. 16)
M I (α, β) ∴M Ạ(α, γ), M Ạ(β, γ), I (α, α), I (β, β)
(IV. 17)
K I (α, β) : : M Ạ(α, γ), MN Ạ(α, γ), M Ạ(β, γ), MN Ạ(β, γ)
(IV. 18)
None of the rules (IV. 7) to (IV. 18) is explicitly assumed by Aristotle; but in An. pr.
1. 9, 30 1 21–13, he argues in a way that can be read as if he assumes at least the
validity of rules (IV. 9) and (IV. 12). With regard to the rules (IV. 11), (IV. 13), and
(IV. 14), the corresponding implicit suppositions can be found in An. pr. 1. 13, 32
b 31–37.

Aristotle indicates in An. pr. 1. 13, 32 b 23–37 that universal contingent propositions
admit a distinction in meaning. According to one meaning, a proposition of the form
‘every α is contingently (not) a β’ entails the statement ‘if something (e.g., a γ) is pos-
sibly a β, then it is contingently (not) an α’. According to the other meaning, by con-
trast, it entails the statement ‘if something (e.g., a γ) (in fact) is a β, then it is
contingently (not) an α’. According to the first meaning, one must understand it so
that rules (IV. 36) to (IV. 41) hold, which depend only on basic rules (IV. 7) and (IV. 8).
In contrast, according to the second meaning, a universal contingent proposition is
to be understood so that basic rule (IV. 11) and rule (IV. 42), which is derived from
(IV. 11) (in conjunction with rules (IV. 43) to (IV. 46)), hold. In An. pr. 1. 13, 32 b 23–37,
Aristotle indicates that the perfect KKK-syllogisms (see (IV. 73) and (IV. 74)) presup-
pose the first meaning, while for perfect syllogisms with only one contingent premise
(see (IV. 75) and (IV. 76)) the second meaning can also be assumed.
This clue from Aristotle is of special interest inasmuch as it shows that one could
also construct the whole contingency syllogistic while entirely forgoing the expres-
sion ‘contingently (it is true that) (not) . . .’ as an extra logical constant, along with
the definitions 11 to 13 that pertain to this constant. In that case, definition 4 in § 59
and basic rules (IV. 7) and (IV. 8) would be understood only as conventions which
stipulate how certain pairs of problematic propositions can be combined into a single
proposition. Even these conventions could be forgone in the construction of the
whole contingency syllogistic. In place of pairs of combined problematic propositions
in syllogisms within the contingency syllogistic, there would in each case only be
problematic propositions. More precisely, in place of K-premises and K-conclusions
there would always be M-propositions of the same quality and quantity. Of course, in
the relevant validity proofs, the MN-propositions which are involved in the respec-
tive K-propositions of the same quantity would also occur. In this way, M-premises
and K-conclusions would take on a special connotation for contingent propositions,
so that ‘possibly (it is true that) . . .’ simultaneously implies ‘possibly (it is true that)
not . . .’ as well, and conversely ‘possibly (it is true that) not . . .’ simultaneously im-
plies ‘possibly (it is true that) . . .’. This situation may explain the fact that Aristotle
himself does not yet use any special expression for contingency, but rather only
speaks of a ‘to be possible’ or a ‘can’.

It follows from line [2] that we have here an indirect proof, i.e., a proof by reduc-
tio ad impossibile (according to rule (I. 2)). This form of the proof corresponds to
the short description that Aristotle gives of it in An. pr. 1. 3, 25 a 27 ff. It is notewor-
thy that in line [12], as in the proof of N I-convertibility (III. 17), a peritrope (II. 9)
is used. – I point to an alternative proof below in my remark to (IV. 52) (which how-
ever is not sufficiently conclusive, since it does not consider the full meaning of ‘L
. . .’ as per definition 2 in § 59).
The present proof for the validity of (IV. 51) does not, of course, refute Nort-
mann’s claim that it must hold “with complete generality” that “there can be no
modal logic which contains a corresponding equivalence theorem [meaning the
theorem that ∀x (B x ⊃□~ A x) is equivalent to ∀x (A x ⊃□~ B x)] and yet would
still preserve the distinction between necessity and actuality“ (Ebert & Nortmann
2007, 370; cf. Nortmann 1996, 56–57). Instead, the proof shows only that the convert-
ibility of apodictic negative propositions does not need to rely on supposing that
the logical form of these propositions can be represented by formulas of the type ∀
x (B x ⊃□~ A x). Nortmann has shown that these propositions are convertible if
they have a structure that can be represented by a formula like ∀x (B x ⊃□~ A x)
and if one assumes that the modal-logical system S5 holds in the Aristotelian syllo-
gistic. This assumption, however, as Nortmann himself concedes, can meet with
“grave concerns,” since it allows “for a series of modal-syllogistic premise combina-
tions that are stronger than the conclusions that Aristotle claims are possible”
(Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 519). Nortmann has also drawn on the system S5 to recon-
struct the proof of the validity of Darii KKK, and this procedure is defended by
220

supposing that it was “Aristotle himself who always, when he converted an eN-
statement [meaning (in my terminology) a LN I-statement], in effect used S5-logical
means – even if he did not suspect this and could not at all have in mind the concep-
tion used today” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 530–31). The proof I have offered makes
superfluous the hypothesis underlying Nortmann’s argumentation that the struc-
ture of LN I-propositions is captured in formulas like ∀x □(B x ⊃□~ A x) and,
because of this structure, that LN I-propositions are convertible only on the as-
sumption of an S5-logic.208

The exposition rule (IV. 15), which is applied twice here, is easier to understand
once one has recognized that it corresponds to the rule
L I (α, β) : : L Ạ(α, γ) ∨L Ạ(β, γ)
(in which ‘∨’ ‚ stands for logical adjunction, i.e., for the non-exclusive ‘. . . or . . .’).
It is indicated in An. pr. 1. 3, 25 a 33–34 that there is an indirect proof for (IV. 52)
and (IV. 53). The proof carried out here as well as for (IV. 53), by contrast, is direct.
An indirect proof for (IV. 52) would be possible if, instead of definition 6 in § 59,
the apodictic particular proposition were defined in such a way that for every true
proposition of the form L I (α, β), it would be possible to form a concept γ for which
an object falls under it to which both concepts α and β necessarily apply. In this
case, it would be possible to apply a rule instead of (IV. 15) (as in the previous
proof), which is used in line [1] of the following proof:

But the definition of L I assumed by this proof is not only incompatible with some
cases in which Aristotle needs a L I-conversion (see my remarks to (IV. 88) and
(IV. 89) below), but also it does not correspond to the ordinary use of L I. So it is
hardly plausible to take this proof to be Aristotelian.
It is more likely that Aristotle assumed that L I-convertibility is directly prov-
able because it can be derived in the following way from the indirectly provable
I-convertibility:

That Aristotle could have had such a derivation in mind is perhaps supported by
his remark in An. pr. 1. 8, 30 a 1–3 (1989, 13), saying that with statements of necessity
“the [universal] negative premise converts in the same way” as assertoric state-
ments, and that the logical constants of the assertoric syllogistic, namely, “being in
as a whole” as well as “predicated of all” are to be “interpret[ed] [. . .] in the same
way” in the case of both apodictic and assertoric statements. Aristotle could be
thinking here of a similarity as expressed in rule (IV. 19), just applied in line [3],
which bears not only on the convertibility of apodictic universal negative state-
ments but also on the convertibility of apodictic particular affirmative statements.
Indeed, a proof for apodictic universal negative propositions would be possible in
just the same way as the one just carried out. It would differ from the latter only by
using (III. 17) instead of (III. 18) in line [1].

The commentary by Ebert & Nortmann (2007, 273) points out that the argument

L I-conversion (IV. 52), as is also the case in the present proof. But this does not
mean that there is a circular proof here, since the proof for (IV. 52) can be carried
out directly and was carried out directly here above. (On the “general reservation
about circularity” [Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 273] that exists in the Aristotle litera-

sparse description of the proof for the validity of (IV. 55) in An. pr. 1. 3, 25 a 40–25
b 2. Although this proof assumes the validity of LN I-conversion (IV. 51), and the
latter is also proven indirectly according to Aristotle’s line of argumentation,
there is no circular proof here, since the validity of (IV. 55) is not assumed in the
proof for the validity of (IV. 51).

§ 63 Modal Syllogisms
I. Perfect modal syllogisms
Aristotle calls the syllogisms to be derived in what follows “perfect” in the sense
that their validity can be proven without having to make use of conversion rules,
exposition rules, or of a reductio ad impossibile, i.e., rule (I. 2). In this, these syllo-
gisms are in accord with the perfect assertoric syllogisms of the previous section
(see § 56). The fact that a perfect modal syllogism is provable without having to
carry out a conversion, exposition, or reductio ad impossibile means that no fur-
ther suppositions are needed for the proof of such a syllogism besides its two
premises (or besides the suppositions explicitly contained in these premises). A
reductio ad absurdum makes such a supposition, since it uses a proposition that
does not belong to the premises of the syllogism that is to be proven, but which
rather expresses the negation of the conclusion that follows from these premises.
Conversion also brings a further supposition into play. This is true for conver-
sions of M-, L-, or K-propositions as well, as emerges from the proofs of the rele-
vant conversion rules (IV. 51) to (IV. 60). Indeed, these proofs each rely on concept
expressions (or concept variables) being introduced which are not contained in
the propositions (or formulas) to be converted. This can be seen in the validity
proofs for rules (IV. 51), (IV. 52), and (IV. 57), on which the remaining modal con-
version rules rely.
With reference to singular modal perfect syllogisms, Aristotle says explicitly that
their validity us “apparent from the definition” (ϕανεϱὸν ἐκ τοῦὁϱισμοῦ) of the
modal-logical constants that occur in their premises (14, 32 b 40 and 14, 33 a 24–25).
In doing so, he explicitly attributes the apparentness of their validity to their “proof”
(ἀπόδειξις) (14, 33 a 27 and 15, 35 a 35). Accordingly, he claims of “imperfect” syllo-
gisms that it “is clear (δῆλον) from [their] proof” that they are imperfect (16, 36 a 1
[1984, 57]). From these hints we can see that treating the modal perfect syllogisms as
it has become usual in the recent literature on Aristotle, i.e., regarding them as “syllo-
gistic implication relations” that have “a self-evident character” (Ebert & Nortmann
2007, 398), does not conform to Aristotle’s views. Instead, they should be treated as
modes of inference whose validity requires a proof which is essentially distinct in its
structure from proofs of the validity of imperfect syllogisms.

In broad outlines, this proof proceeds similarly to the proof for Barbara (III. 20).
This conforms to the way Aristotle in An. pr. 1. 8, 29 b 36 ff., regarding the question
of the validity of perfect syllogisms with only apodictic premises, is content with the
general explanation that syllogisms of necessity behave “much the same” (σχεδὸν
ὁμοίως) as the assertoric. “In the case of what is necessary, things are pretty much
the same as in the case of what belongs; for when the terms are put in the same
way, then, whether something belongs or necessarily belongs (or does not belong), a
deduction will or will not result alike in both cases, the only difference being the
addition of the expression ‘with necessity’ to the terms” (29 b 37–30 a 2 [1984, 48]). It
fits with this remark that the following proofs for Celarent LLL, Darii LLL, and Ferio
LLL also proceed largely similarly to the proofs for Celarent (III. 21), Darii (III. 22)
and Ferio (III. 23), respectively.

Compare An. pr. 1. 9, 30 a 15–23. According to Nortmann, we have in Barbara LXL
a combination of premises which is best rendered as ∀x □(B x ⊃□A x) & ∀x (C x
⊃B x). However, he himself points out that from this combination only a weak-
ened statement of necessity would follow, namely a statement of the form ∀x (C x
⊃□A x) (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 386–93).209 Since Barbara LXL belongs among
perfect syllogisms, whose validity according to Aristotle depends only on the defi-
nitions of the logical constants that occur in them, it certainly cannot be supposed
that Aristotle could allow that the same logical vocabulary could, if it appears in
different places of a perfect syllogism, be used with a different meaning.
Nortmann, however, is of the opinion that “the pure de dicto reading of neces-
sity statements” – which is how he designates the depiction of these statements with
expressions (which I use as well) of the type ‘L A (α, β)’ – “must be given up if claims
like that of the validity of Barbara NXN [meaning Barbara LXL in the notation I use]
are supposed to be capable of verification” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 384). As his rea-
son for this opinion, Nortmann states that with the “pure de dicto reading” of neces-
sity statements, the move carried out in Barbara LXL from L A (α, β) and A (β, γ) to
L A (α, γ) would only be justified if one could move from L A (α, β) & A (β, γ) to L (A
(α, β) & A (β, γ)) (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 383–84). He points out that this move is
impermissible because, since L (A (α, β) & A (β, γ)) is equivalent to L A (α, β) & L A
Here and in what follows I use a different notation than Nortmann.

(β, γ)), the move in question includes a move from A (β, γ) to L A (β, γ), and this
would conform to no reasonable use of the concept of necessity (Ebert & Nortmann
2007, 383–84). I do not want to call this point into question. But I see no grounds for
Nortmann’s tacit supposition that there is no other justification for the move in Bar-
bara LXL from L A (α, β) and A (β, γ) to L A (α, γ) than the one he considers to be
impermissible. That there is indeed such a justification can be seen in the proof for
(IV. 65) that I have presented above. Yet it is immediately clear from the rules that
come to application in this proof that it would be improper to designate my render-
ing of statements of necessity using expressions of the type ‘L A (α, β)’ as the ‘pure
de dicto reading’ of such statements. To be sure, the expression ‘L A . . .’ does corre-
spond to the de dicto use of ‘necessary’, since this expression is equivalent to ‘it is
necessar(ily true) that . . .’. But L A (α, β) immediately implies, according to § 59,
def. 6, and according to rule (IV. 9), ‘If some γ is a β, then this γ is necessarily an α’.
In this way, L A (α, β) immediately entails a statement about a de re necessity.

According to Nortmann’s interpretation, similarly to Barbara LXL a conclusion re-
sults for Celarent LXL whose logical form deviates from the form of the major
premise. While the form of the major premise in this interpretation would be ren-
dered with ∀x □(B x ⊃□~ A x), the corresponding form of the conclusion would
3 Derived Rules § 63
229

have to be ∀x (B x ⊃□~ A x). Yet Nortmann himself has pointed out that a conclu-
sion of this form is not convertible. This result is not compatible with Aristotle’s
supposition that the validity of Camestres XLL, Darapti XLL, and Disamis XLL is
provable by the conversion of the conclusion of Celarent LXL. Accordingly, Nort-
mann takes Aristotle’s claim for the validity of Camestres XLL, Darapti XLL, and
Disamis XLL to be one of his logical errors. (See Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 388;
419; 456.)
In the modal predicate-logical reading of Klaus J. Schmidt as well, Celarent LXL
is a mode of inference which is only valid if the statements of necessity in its conclu-
sion position have a different structure than in the premise position. In his view, the
one structure is rendered by the formula ∀x □(◇B x ⊃□A x), the other by the
formula ∀x (C x ⊃□A x). Furthermore, Schmidt points out that this formula is de-
rivable from the premise formulas only on the assumption of a B-logic.210

3 Derived Rules § 63

The proof for Ferio KKK, which Aristotle treats in An. pr. 1. 14, 33 a 25–27, differs
from the one for (IV. 74) only in that in line [1] the rule (IV. 38) is applied, and in
line [2] the rule (IV. 39) is applied, and in line [9] the rule (IV. 8) is applied.
Authors who give Darii KKK a modal predicate-logical interpretation concede no
validity to this inference form unless they suppose that the logical structure of both
the K-premises that occur here and thus the meaning of ‘contingently (it is true that)
. . .’ is different in the two premises. According to K.J. Schmidt (2000, 121), in Darii
KKK there are premises of the form ∀x (◇B x ⊃○A x) and ∃x (○C x & ○B x),
(with ○A = ◇A & ◇~ A). Nortmann puts at the basis of his interpretation the prem-
ise formulas ∀x □(B x ⊃○A x) and ∃x ○(C x & ○B x). He shows that, assuming an
S5-logic, which admits the law of possibility simplification (◇◇A ⊃◇A), a valid
inference to ∃x ○(C x & ○A x) comes about (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 516–18).211
Since Aristotle counts Darii KKK among perfect syllogism, i.e., among modes of infer-
ence whose validity depends only on the meaning of the logical constants that occur
in them, the reconstruction proposals of Schmidt and Nortmann are rather to be
rejected.

For Celarent KXK a proof can be given which is analogous to the proof for rule
(VI. 75). It differs from the proof for (IV. 75) only in that in lines [1] and [2] the

According to Aristotle, this proof proceeds analogously to the proof for Barbara
KXK (see An. pr. 1. 15, 33 b 36–40).

The analogous proof for Ferio KXK can be carried out in such a way that in line [1]
it is concluded according to rule (IV. 46), in line [2] according to rule (IV. 45), and in
line [7] according to rule (IV. 8). Aristotle, who discusses Ferio KXK in An. pr. 1. 15,
35 a 30–35, indicates the analogy in its proof.

Compare An. pr. 1. 16, 35 b 23 ff. According to Klaus J. Schmidt (2000, 146–49), the
necessity premise of Barbara KLK has the form ∀x (C x ⊃□B x), which deviates
from modus Barbara LKM (IV. 94), where this premise is supposed to have the
3 Derived Rules § 63
235

form □∀x (B x ⊃A x). A uniform formalization of the modal syllogistic is thus
not possible on this reading. According to Nortmann (1996, 115), the necessity
premise of Barbara KLK has the form □∀x (C x ⊃□B x). Schmidt and Nortmann
agree in that they believe to have discerned the ‘perfection’ of modus Barbara
KLK in its inner structure. Nortmann thinks that on the basis of this structure this
mode has “the simplicity” of a “easily manageable transitivity inference” (Ebert &
Nortmann 2007, 602).
The proof for Celarent KLK which Aristotle treats in An. pr. 1. 16, 36 a 17–21
differs from the one for (IV. 77) by starting in line [1] from Celarent KXK, rather
than from Barbara KXK. In just the same way, Darii KLK and Ferio KLK can be
derived from Darii KXK and Ferio KXK, respectively. Incidentally, these forms do
not occur in Aristotle, but they are compatible with his suppositions. He merely
rules out, in An. pr. 1. 16, 36 a 39–36 b 2, that an assertoric conclusion can be in-
ferred from the premises which are assumed in accordance with these rules.

General Comment on Section 2 ((IV. 86) – (IV. 89)):
For all syllogisms with the premise combination LX or XL in the second and third
figure, apart from Baroco and Bocardo, validity proofs can be carried out with con-
version, just as they can be carried out for syllogisms of these figures with the prem-
ise combination LL (see above (IV. 78) to (IV. 85)). In these proofs it is assumed that
the syllogisms of the first figure with the corresponding combinations of premises
are valid. A premise combination of LX or XL yields apodictic conclusions in
the second figure only with Camestres XLL and Festino LXL, in the third figure only
with Darapti LXL and XLL, Felapton LXL, Disamis XLL, Datisi LXL, and Ferison
LXL. Baroco and Bocardo, with only one apodictic and only one assertoric premise,
do not have an apodictic conclusion. That these, as with some of the remaining syl-
logisms with the premise combination LX or XL, do not have apodictic conclusions
is proven by Aristotle in the manner typical of him elsewhere, with the aid of ex-
ample substitutions for α, β, and γ.
The relevant invalidity proofs can be easily carried out, just like the va-
lidity proofs by conversion. They follow in general the pattern according to which
Cesare LXL (IV. 86) is proven. It may thus suffice here to consider objections have
been raised against the demonstrative force of some of these proofs.
Thus, against the invalidity proof for Bocardo LXL (An. pr. 1. 11, 32, a 4–5),
i.e., for
LN A (α, γ), A (β, γ) ∴LN A (α, β),
it has been objected that a weakly apodictic conclusion cannot be ruled out by the
proof. Aristotle substitutes for α, β, and γ the terms ‘bipedal’, ‘in motion’, and ‘animal’
in turn. His argument can be understood as saying that the supposition that necessar-
ily not every animal (e.g., no horse) is bipedal and that (in fact) every animal is in
motion is compatible with the supposition that it is possible that everything that is in
motion is bipedal (while everything else, including non-bipedal animals, are not in
motion). According to this argument, Bocardo LXL is not a universally valid inference
form. To see the demonstrative force of this argumentation, it suffices, on the one
hand, to accept that animals are both capable of being in motion as well as capable
of not being in motion, and, on the other hand, tacitly to assume a restricted set of
objects as the relevant domain. For example, if one assumes that by ‘animals’ is
meant the pets of Athens, and by ‘objects in motion’ is meant the objects which are
3 Derived Rules § 63
239

on their feet in Athens, then the case in which everything is bipedal that is in Athens
and on its feet is hardly less possible as the case in which all Athenian pets are with-
out exception in motion. If thus the case in which all Athenian pets are in motion,
even despite its improbability, is assumed as actually true (as here in the second
premise), then indeed at least the bare possibility of the case cannot be ruled out that
everything that moves in Athens is bipedal, even if one admits, with the first premise,
that necessarily not every animal (and not even every Athenian pet) is bipedal.
Now, the objection to this argumentation does not involve, say, the suggestion
that Aristotle’s selection of example terms is unsuited for his invalidity proof, but
rather the thesis that Bocardo LXL is valid and hence that an invalidity proof for it is
impossible. Of course, this thesis rests on the assumption that the L-premise in Bo-
cardo LXL has either (according to Nortmann) the form ∃x □(C x & □~ A x) or
(according to Schmidt) the weaker form ∃x (C x & □~ A x), while the X-premise has
the form ∀x (C x ⊃B x). On this assumption, Bocardo LXL has, relative to ∃x □(B x
& □~ A x), a weakly apodictic conclusion of the form ∃x (B x & □~ A x).212 It can be
seen here that the objection brought forth is only convincing if one supposes that the
Aristotelian syllogistic admits a variability in the meaning of logical constants. For
even Schmidt assumes here such variability, since he supposes for the structure of
the apodictic particular negative proposition that, though it does not (as according to
Nortmann) vary within one and the same syllogism, it does vary within the system
of the Aristotelian modal syllogistic, so that it must be represented sometimes by for-
mulas of the type ∃x (B x & □~ A x) but other times by formulas of the type ∃x □(B
x & ~ A x) (see Schmidt 2000, 36 and 43). Such variability jars with Aristotle’s basic
suppositions.
In Nortmann’s view, the proof that Aristotle sketches for the validity of Ca-
mestres XLL is also mistaken. This proof can be depicted as follows:

According to Nortmann, the mistake in such a demonstration, in his view, is that the
logical form of the conclusion of Celarent LXL (IV. 66), whose conversion is carried

out in line [3] according to rule (IV. 51), should only be rendered by the formula ∀x
(B x ⊃□~ C x), yet the latter does not imply the formula ∀x (C x ⊃□~ B x). The
conversion in line [3] is thus not permitted. The exposure of the supposed logical
error here, with the aid of modal quantificational logic, is in Nortmann’s eyes so
significant that he states: “One sees in cases like this that the standard schematic
presentation of syllogistic reductions in the modal-logical domain which limit them-
selves to the traditional notation often turn out to be too undifferentiated to be
able to guarantee a reliable estimation of the respective logical relationships”
(Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 419). Yet Nortmann starts out from assumptions which in
my view are not at all borne out. For, first of all, his objection to the proof for Ca-
mestres XLL assumes that the conclusion of Celarent LXL (see my remarks to
(IV. 66)), deviates in its logical form from the logical form of the major premise of
this mode. Of course, such variability jars with the basic suppositions of Aristotle,
and especially not with the fact that Celarent LXL belongs among the perfect syllo-
gisms, whose validity rest only on the definition of the logical constants that occur
in them. This is already reason enough not to suppose that, if the same bit of logical
vocabulary (here the expression ‘LN I . . .’) occurs twice in a perfect syllogism, it is
used with a different meaning each time. Secondly, Nortmann assumes that apodic-
tic universal negative propositions are only convertible if they have a structure as
in the premise position of Celarent LXL, namely, a structure which can be rendered
by an (S5-logically convertible) formula of the type ∀x □(A x ⊃□~ B x). This as-
sumption too is not borne out (see § 59, def. 9) in connection with rule (IV. 13) and
the proof of (IV. 51).213
Nortmann raises similar objections against the proofs Aristotle carries out for
the validity of Darapti XLL and Disamis XLL as against Camestres XLL. These
proofs can be presented as follows:
Darapti XLL:
A (α, γ), L A (β, γ) ∴L I (α, β)

K.J. Schmidt takes Camestres XLL to be valid, but he likewise supposes that the apodictic form in
the premise position deviates from the apodictic form in the conclusion position. The latter can be
portrayed with the formula ∀x □(C x ⊃◇~ B x), the former with the formula ∀x □(◇C x ⊃~ A x).

The conversion carried out in line [3] of both these proofs, of the L I-conclusion of
the modus Darii LXL (IV. 67) used in line [1] of each, is in Nortmann’s view illegiti-
mate, since the logical form of this conclusion can in his opinion only be suitably
rendered by the formula ∃x (A x & □~ B x), but this (only weakly apodictic) formula
does not imply the formula ∃x (B x & □~ A x). (See Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 445–46
and 456.) It is doubtless true that the L I-conclusion that is to be converted in the first
line of both proofs should only be understood as stating in each case the necessary
pertaining of a predicate β to an object, but not also the necessary pertaining of α. For
according to the expression of the second premise in this line, i.e., according to ‘I (γ, α)’
and according to the conversion of I (γ, α) carried out in line [2], the predicate α
pertains to an object γ, which falls under the concepts α and β, only actually or in
fact. Hence α does not need to pertain to it necessarily. Yet it is incorrect to suppose
that for this reason the L I-conclusion that is to be converted can only be suitably
rendered by the formula ∃x (A x & □~ B x). Rather, this conclusion admits a
reading in the sense of definition 7 in § 59 and accordingly also admits a conver-
sion according to rule (IV. 51).

Aristotle proves the validity of rule (IV. 90) in An. pr. 1. 15, 34 a 34–b 2 likewise with
reductio ad impossibile, i.e., by means of (I. 2). As the starting point for his proof, he
selects a rule of the third figure and indicates that it is modus Bocardo (III. 34), as
in line [1] above. The procedure in this proof of first replacing the K-premise with a
non-modalized premise is designated by Alexander of Aphrodisias as metalepsis (In
de An. pr. 217, 10). – According to K.J. Schmidt, Barbara XKM is not universally valid
(see Schmidt 2000, 128–38). According to Nortmann, in the framework of an S4-logic,
Barbara XKM can be justified as an inference from the premise ∀x □(B x ⊃A x),
which here (despite the ‘□’) is supposed to hold as assertoric, and the premise ∀x □
(C x ⊃(◇B x & ◇~ B x)), to ∀x □(C x ⊃◇A x) (see Ebert & Nortmann 2007,
557).214
Nortmann justifies rendering an assertoric premise with ∀x □(B x ⊃A x) by
referencing 34 b 7 ff., where Aristotle says that in the present case the A premise
should not be regarded as a statement about a temporally restricted, contingent
fact, or else an invalidity proof for Barbara XKM could result. Aristotle may be
thinking here of a kind of invalidity proof like the one he previously carried out for
Bocardo LXL in An. pr. 1. 11, 32 a 4 f. (see my General Comment to section 2, (VI. 86)
to (VI. 89)) (p. ff.)). The distinction which Aristotle here suggests for the assertoric
statements corresponds to the distinction between two kinds of the ‘factual’ or ac-
tual, which I have pointed out above in § 6, note 40. According to Nortmann, we
would have to suppose that this distinction corresponds to the distinction be-
tween the formulas ∀x □(B x ⊃A x) and ∀x (B x ⊃A x). But this should by no
means be accepted. For a statement of the form ∀x (B x ⊃A x) is already true if
there is no x at all to which B x would apply. Accordingly, the proposition, e.g., ∀x
([now moves on this table] x ⊃[is an ant] x) is already true when there is nothing
that now moves on this table. By contrast, in this case one would have to regard
the proposition ‘Everything that now moves on this table is an ant’ as false if it is to
be understood as a proposition that says something about a contingent fact. –
Aristotle describes the proof for Celarent XKM in An. pr. 1. 15, 34 b 19–16 as
proceeding similarly to the proof for Barbara XKM, which takes modus Disamis
as its starting point. Rule (IV. 29), which is used in both proofs, is briefly intro-
duced by Aristotle in An. pr. 1. 15, 34 a 20–25, before he sketches both proofs.

Aristotle points out in An. pr. 1. 15, 35 a 35–40 that the proofs for the validity of Darii
XKM and Ferio XKM are carried out in just the same way as the proofs for Barbara
XKM and Celarent XKM, respectively. Following this (15, 35 b 2–8), Aristotle points out
in addition that due to the ‘complementary convertibility’ of propositions of the form
KN A (β, γ) to K I (β, γ) according to rule (IV. 50), the second premise in syllogisms of
the form Darii XKM and Ferio XKM is exchangeable with KN A (β, γ). – According to
Nortmann, Darii XKM is valid if one supposes that it deals with the consequence of
∃x (◇B x & ◇A x) from ∀x □(C x ⊃A x) and ∃x (○B x & ○C x) (with ○A = ◇A &
◇~ A). In that case, ∀x □(C x ⊃A x) is supposed to be taken as an assertoric formula,
despite the appearance of □(Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 696).

ther non-canonical syllogisms of the second figure can be similarly derived by
‘complementary conversion’ according to rules (IV. 47) to (IV. 50), from valid syllo-
gisms of the first figure with a K-premise, e.g., syllogisms each with three proposi-
tions of the form LNI, KNI, and MNI (19, 38 b 6–12), or LNI, KNI, and MNA (19, 38 b
31–35), or KNI, LNI, and MNI (19, 38 b 12).
General Comment on Section 5 ((IV. 101) – (IV. 104)):
Concerning syllogisms in the second figure with one apodictic premise and the
other contingent, the modern literature has contested not so much the relevant va-
lidity proofs of Aristotle as his proofs for the invalidity of singular modes of infer-
ence with the premise combinations KL and LK. However, it seems to me that
there are opportunities to object only inasmuch as one starts from an understand-
ing of the logical constants occurring in these modes of inference that does not cor-
respond to the understanding expressed in the definitions of § 59. It should suffice
here to comment on this issue with the help of an example. Thus, Nortmann views
Aristotle’s proof for the invalidity of Cesare KLX, i.e., for the inference form
KN I (α, β), L A (α, γ) ∴N I (β, γ),
as erroneous. Aristotle runs the proof (see An. pr. 1. 19, 38 a 38–42) by substituting
the terms ‘in motion’, ‘animal’, and ‘in a waking state’ for α, β, and γ, in sequence.
Accordingly, he supposes that the inference:
248
Part II Section Four Modal Syllogistic

Every animal is contingently at one time not in motion,
Every being which is in a waking state is necessarily in motion,
Therefore: no being which is in a waking state is an animal,
is invalid because its conclusion is false. Aristotle even supposes that not only the
contradictory of this conclusion (namely, ‘Some being which is in a waking state is a
living being’), but also the stronger statement ‘Every being which is in a waking
state is an animal’ (38 b 1–2), is true. This supposition needs a comment, for appar-
ently Aristotle assumes along with it – as happens occasionally elsewhere in his in-
validity proofs (e.g., in the invalidity proof for Bocardo LXL (see above p. 340–41)) –
a restricted domain of individuals. According to the views Aristotle holds elsewhere,
there are animate beings (e.g., plants) to which something like a waking state can
hardly be ascribed. Accordingly, one must presume that Aristotle supposes a re-
stricted domain, so that by ‘animal’ in the conclusion (but then also already in its
first premise) only, e.g., beasts or mammals are meant. The two remaining terms
require an interpretation as well if both premises (by Aristotle’s own standards) are
supposed to be taken as true. At best, they are true if by ‘motion’ – Aristotle speaks
even more generally in the present context of “change” (κίνησις, 38 a 42) – particu-
lar motions or changes are meant. For (in Aristotle’s view as well) it should hold for
all animals without exception that they necessarily have (some kind of) motion or
change. The second premise suggests the presumption that Aristotle is thinking in
both premises of a kind of motion which necessarily occurs in animals in a waking
state. According to this presumption, ‘motion’ would be understood as something
like the active intake of sensory stimuli.215 On this reading, the first premise would
be replaced by the surely true proposition ‘Every mammal is contingently not in a
condition of the active intake of sensory stimuli’; the second premise would be re-
placed by the likewise true proposition ‘Everything that is in a waking state is neces-
sarily in a condition of the active intake of sensory stimuli’. In this way, Aristotle’s
argumentation can admit a reading which shows it to present an example of the
invalidity of inferences according to modus Cesare KLX, namely an example in
which the premises are true and the conclusion false. The invalidity proof is thus
unobjectionable.
That Aristotle is thinking of motions or changes which are necessarily, i.e., in all circumstan-
ces, connected to being awake is ultimately suggested by the fact that he makes formulaic use of
his supposition that being in motion belongs to all that is awake in other invalidity proofs as well.
See, e.g., 38 b 35–37 or 40 a 36–38. Consider especially that in Parva Naturalia 454 b 24–27 (1984,
723) “animal” or “beast” (ζῷον) is defined by “possessing sense-perception” (αἴσϑησις); sleep is “as it
were, a motionless bond, imposed on sense-perception (ἀκινησία)”; being awake is the “loosening
or remission [of this bond].”
3 Derived Rules § 63
249

In Nortmann’s view, by contrast, this proof is not unobjectionable.216 His ob-
jection is to supposing the truth of the second premise, i.e., the proposition
Every being which is in a waking state is necessarily in motion.
For Nortmann, this proposition can be understood either as a statement about a
pure de dicto necessity, i.e., as a statement of the form
(1)
□∀x ([is awake] x ⊃[is in motion] x),
or as a statement of one of the following forms (if not as a statement that at least
comes close to one of these forms):
(2)
∀x ([is awake] x ⊃□[is in motion] x),
∀x (□[is awake] x ⊃□[is in motion] x),
∀x (◇[is awake] x ⊃□[is in motion] x).
As a statement of the form (1), the premise could, Nortmann believes, indeed ap-
pear to be “plausible,” but it would then have a logical form that necessity state-
ments precisely cannot have in the framework of Aristotle’s modal syllogistic. For
it can be regarded as “sufficiently secure” that the Aristotelian modal syllogistic
does not treat necessity statements like propositions of the form (1). However, as
a statement of one of the forms under (2), the premise in question would have
“no doubt [to be] taken as false”. “Since for every awake animal, there is a possi-
bility (to fall into sleep and then) not to be in motion.”
Of course, this objection is only convincing if it may be assumed that the al-
ternative of forms (1) and (2) is complete. But this assumption is not borne out.
For this alternative leaves out of consideration the form
(3) L A (in motion, awake),
which according to § 59, definition 6, and according to rule (IV. 9) implies the ex-
pression ‘If something (e.g., a ξ) is awake, then it (this ξ) is necessarily in motion’,
whose logical form is represented by
(3′) H (I (awake, ξ), L Ạ(in motion, ξ)).
To be sure, (3) (just like (1)) can be considered as a form of a statement about a de
dicto necessity. For (3) can be rendered by the proposition ‘It is necessarily true that
everything awake is in motion’. But since (3) implies the form (3′), (3) can just as well
See for the following Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 662–64 and 672.
250
Part II Section Four Modal Syllogistic

(in a similar way as (2)) be understood as a form of a statement about a de re neces-
sity. To that extent, (3) is a necessity statement neither “of a pure de dicto type”, nor
(like ∀x (A x ⊃□B x)) “of a pure de re type” (to use Nortmann’s phraseology). This is
because (3′) is equivalent to the de dicto necessity statement
(3′′) LH (I (awake, ξ), Ạ(in motion, ξ)).
One can therefore regard (3′) as a necessity statement of a latent de dicto type, just as
one can regard (3) as a necessity statement of a latent de re type. (3) and (3′) are ex-
pressions that are not supposed to render different kinds of necessity, but rather one
and the same kind of necessary truth, i.e., a kind of truth which is distinct from mere
actual truth, e.g., the truth of the proposition ‘Everything that is awake is less than
500 years old’ (whether this should be true at once time or over larger periods of
time). Since the term ‘moves’ in the context of the invalidity proof we have just con-
sidered must mean (as already mentioned) a state which is necessarily in-
volved in waking states, (3′) should be taken as a proposition which cannot be false.
The possibility of being able to sleep (which is mentioned by Nortmann) and then
no longer being in motion, which holds for any animal that is awake, does not
stand in logical conflict with the statement of the second premise that if something
(e.g., an animal) is awake, it is also necessarily in motion. The necessity of the truth
of this statement rests simply on the fact that the concept of the state of motion
involved in the waking state is subordinate to the concept of the waking state, so
that the concept of the object which moves in a specific way due to its waking state
is also subordinate to the concept of waking (just as the concept of the human
being is subordinate to that of the animal); while, on the other hand, the concept of
the object which is in a state of motion contingent for animals is not subordinate to
the concept of the animal.

If rule (IV. 57) is applied in line [2], according to which one may move from K I (β, γ)
to K I (γ, β), then Datisi XKM results (An. pr. 1. 21, 39 a 39 b 26–31). By contrast, Felap-
ton XKM results if one begins in line [1] from Ferio XKM instead of Darii XKM (IV. 92)
(compare An. pr. 1. 21, 39 b 17–19). To derive Ferison XKM, one can likewise begin in
line [1] with Ferio XKM, but one then has to start with K I (β, γ) for the conversion
in line [2], thus applying rule (IV. 57). Compare An. pr. 1. 21, 39 b 26–31.
Syllogisms of the third figure can be derived from Darapti XKM and Felapton
XKM by ‘complementary conversion’ according to rule (IV. 48), which are each
formed from three propositions of the form A, KNI, and MI and NI, KNI, and
MNA, respectively (39 b 22–25).
According to Nortmann, Darapti XKM should be regarded as an S4-logical con-
sequence of ∃x (◇B x & ◇A x) from ∀x □(C x ⊃A x) and ∀x □(C x ⊃○B x) & ∃

(i.e., the formula L A (α, β) (see line [1]) may be translated into the formula ∀x □
(C x ⊃□A x), so that the proof is led to its end successfully from this point,
though only in the framework of an S4-logic (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 706–12).
Yet in his reconstruction of the validity proof for Barbara LXL, he had sup-
posed that for this mode of inference only a weakened conclusion was possi-
ble, namely, ∀x (C x ⊃□A x). (See my remarks to (IV. 65) above.)

Part II Section Four Modal Syllogistic

III. Concluding Remarks to Section Four of Part II, ‘Modal Syllogistic’
The reconstruction carried out in this Section, both of proofs of the validity of Aris-
totelian modal syllogisms as well as the invalidity of certain modal-logical modes of
inference that Aristotle held to be invalid, shows that the Aristotelian modal syllo-
gistic is a unified and internally coherent and consistent system of rules. In this
reconstruction, I have, just like Ulrich Nortmann, let myself be guided by the “inter-
esting question, which also corresponds to a well-established research tradition,” of
“how far one can do justice to the modal-logical chapters in their entirety with uni-
form presentations of the relevant types of statement” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007,
451). The interpretive maxims that Nortmann sets up turn out to be helpful: on the
one hand, to admit the hypothesis that “Aristotle could here and there let logical
mistakes creep in”, but, on the other hand, to accept that “every interpretation of
the modal syllogistic [must] have the aim of neither imputing too many errors to
Aristotle, nor charging him with too trivial errors” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 277). As
Nortmann is inclined to think, “One will hardly expect otherwise than that for each
of Aristotle’s validity claims that one encounters in the modal part of his syllogistic,
some modal predicate-logical presentation of the thematized syllogistic statements
can be found which allows the claim to be verified – so that with a corresponding
variation of the presentations, the number of mistakes diagnosed in Aristotle
can be easily minimized” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 451). An undertaking that
would save as many parts of the Aristotelian modal syllogistic as possible at the
cost of its coherence and systematic unity seems to me (as to Nortmann) to be a
much less interesting and productive one than the attempt to stuck to a single
(and as simple as possible) interpretive approach in the reconstruction of this
system from start to finish.
It seems to me that such an attempt has been successfully carried out with the
interpretative approach I have adopted in the present Section, even if I concede
that in many details more precise textual analyses would be needed to verify that
this approach nowhere comes into conflict with Aristotle’s basic suppositions and
the argumentative steps. This is a task to which, in my opinion, future investiga-
tions should be devoted. It could be that, when this task is achieved, here and there
modifications of my interpretive approach will be required. Yet the suppositions I
have formulated in § 59 regarding the meaning of the logical constants accepted by
Aristotle and the basic rules of § 60, corresponding to these suppositions, have
proven their worth in making demonstrable the throughgoing conclusiveness of
the proofs in different parts of Aristotle’s modal-logical system; and this seems to
me to speak in favor of these suppositions’ being essentially in agreement with the
basic suppositions of Aristotle. To be sure, the definitions of § 59 may in some
3 Derived Rules § 63
259

details be different than the definitions Aristotle explicitly mentions and which can
be supposed to lay at the basis of his proofs for perfect syllogisms. They are surely
different in their form. But in their content, they may largely agree with the Aristo-
telian definitions. If one pays attention to the precise content of these definitions, it
should be seen that the logical constants whose meanings they determine at least
approximate a natural and ordinary use of the expressions of the modal-syllogistic
vocabulary.
In this way, the present reconstruction also shows that the undertaking to
render rules of the Aristotelian syllogistic in a language I have called the elemen-
tary language of the syllogistic in Part I of this book is clearly superior to the at-
tempt to translate these rules into the language of the calculus of functions,
enriched with the vocabulary of modal logic. Until now, as far as I know, no one
has been able to show that a modal predicate-logical interpretation of the Aristo-
telian modal syllogistic is possible as a uniform, coherent, and consistent system
of rules that rests on precise and gapless proofs. By contrast, as has been shown
here, it is completely possible to present the Aristotelian modal syllogistic as a
system that exemplifies such qualities if it occurs in a notation which is the lan-
guage of the elementary syllogistic.
Finally, it has also been shown in this way that, if one adds the results of the
first three Sections of Part II of this book, it is possible to present the entire Aristo-
telian syllogistic as a uniform, coherent, and consistent system that rests on unob-
jectionable proofs. In this presentation, the logic of Aristotle can be recognized as
a permanent scientific achievement, of which Hegel (1816, 21–22) has rightly said
that it “must fill us with greatest admiration for the strength of this mind.” To be
sure, this achievement concerns, from a contemporary point of view, a relatively
small sphere of logic as a whole. But since it would be inappropriate to regard the
Aristotelian syllogistic with Günther Patzig (1969, 198) only as “the theory of a spe-
cific sphere of logic for two-place relations”, which as a “specific theory” could
not be “general”, it is instead appropriate to say that its rules, because of their
general validity, are foundational for logic in its entirety, so that Aristotle can be
regarded, with greater right than any other logician, as the founder of general
logic. That this is so will be seen even more clearly in what follows.
260
Part II Section Four Modal Syllogistic

Section Five
Contentful Syllogistic Inference
Contentful syllogistic inference consists simply in putting in contentfully determi-
nate propositions or concept expressions (i.e., propositions like ‘Socrates is mortal’
or concept expressions like ‘mortal’ and ‘human being’) in place of propositional or
conceptual variables in the schemata for syllogistic inferences and consequences.
However, in the present Section I will consider contentful syllogistic inferences
only insofar as they contain contentfully determinate concept expressions which
implicitly occur in the calculus of functions as well and play a foundational role in
it. To this extent, this Section has only a preparatory character with respect to the
sixth and seventh Sections. It shows that the language of the calculus of functions
differs from the language of the syllogistic mainly in that the former involves com-
plex conceptual contents and logically relevant structures of such contents. This
Section also shows that this involvement entails a linguistic transformation of the
logical rules of the syllogistic, without in any way affecting the validity of these
rules. It shows, finally, that contrary to a widespread opinion, the syllogistic is
completely capable of explaining the logical validity of inferences that seem to
obey no rules other than those peculiar to the calculus of functions.
§ 64 Notation
To be able to present some concrete conceptual contents which may occur in
premises and conclusions of syllogistic inferences, I will substitute for some con-
cept variables certain conceptual constants and for others certain constellations
of logical and descriptive signs of the following kind.
(1) I use as logical signs:
(a) the three quantifier prefixes (∀xi) . . .’ (as the prefix for the universal quanti-
fier), ‘(∃xi) . . .’ (as the prefix for the existential quantified) and ‘(∇xi) . . .’
(as the quantifier prefix for a singular proposition) (each with i ≧1),
(b) the predicator prefix ‘(′xi) . . .’ (with i ≧1).
(2) As descriptive signs I use:
(a) Individual constants ‘a1’, ‘a2’, ‘a3’, etc.;
(b) Functional expressions
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-009

‘F1 (x1)’, ‘F2 (x1)’, ‘F3 (x1)’, etc.,
‘F1 (x1, x2)’, ‘F2 (x1, x2)’, ‘F3 (x1, x2)’, etc.,
...
‘F1 (x1, . . ., xn)’, ‘F2 (x1, . . ., xn)’, ‘F3 (x1, . . ., xn)’, (with n > 2) etc.;
in these expressions the different argument places (in which the individual
variables ‘x1’, ‘x2’, . . ., ‘xn’ appear) can be fully or partly occupied by individual
constants; they can also be occupied, fully or partly, by one and the same indi-
vidual constant or by one and the same individual variable;
(c) Conceptual constants ‘ξ1’, ‘ξ2’, ‘ξ3’ etc., and ‘ζ1’, ‘ζ2’, ‘ζ3’, etc.
(3) Metalinguistic designations:
(a) As a substitute for an individual variable ‘x1’ or ‘x2’ or ‘x3’ etc., I use the itali-
cized lower-case letter ‘v’.
(b) As a substitute for an individual constant ‘a1’ or ‘a2’ or ‘a3’ etc., I use the itali-
cized lower-case letter ‘t’.
(c) As a substitute for an arbitrary (and arbitrarily complex) functional expres-
sion, but which contains only one freely occurring variable ‘v’, I use one of
the expressions ‘A (v)’, ‘B (v)’, ‘C (v)’, etc.
(d) As a substitute for a conceptual constant ‘ξ1’ or ξ2’ or ‘ξ3’, etc., I use ‘ξ’ (without
an index numeral) and likewise for a conceptual constant ‘ζ1’, or ‘ζ2’ or ‘ζ3’,
etc., I use ‘ζ’ (without an index numeral).
(4) Abbreviations:
(a) ‘F1’, ‘F2’, and ‘F3’ may be abbreviated by ‘F’, ‘G’, and ‘K’, ‘x1’, ‘x2’, and ‘x3’ by ‘x’,
‘y’, and ‘z’, and finally ‘a1’, ‘a2’, and ‘a3’ by ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.
(b) ‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ζ)’ is abbreviated by ‘[A (t)]’,
‘A ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∀v) A (v)’,
‘I ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∃v) A (v)’ and finally
‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ)’ by ‘(∇v) A (v)’.
The square brackets in ‘[A (t)]’ deserve special notice, since they may not be set
aside without further ado. Namely, if A equals N B, then ‘[A (t)]’ abbreviates
the expression ‘Ạ((′v) N B (v), ζ)’, which, it should be noted, is not equivalent to
‘N Ạ((′v) B (v), ζ)’. Hence, ‘[N B (t)]’ and ‘N [B (t)]’ are not equivalent either. The
square brackets may be omitted only if it is provable that two formulas, which
differ from each other only by the occurrence of one of these two expressions
in each, render equally valid rules.
262
Part II Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference

§ 65 Comments on the Notation
With the signs and sign connectors I have introduced in § 64 and which I will discuss
more precisely in what follows, expressions are introduced which stand for concept
words or components of certain concept expressions. Among such components, I
also count the expressions which are called quantifiers in modern logic books. These
are abbreviations for expressions which take the place of the grammatical subject in
categorical propositions, but they can also appear as components of concept words.
1. The conceptual constant ξ abbreviates the specific concept expression ‘object
which is a member of the non-empty domain of the objects designated by “v”.
This constant can take the place of a concept variable in a syllogistic expression.
2. The conceptual constant ζ abbreviates the specific concept expression ‘bearer
of the proper name t’. This constant can also take the place of a concept variable
in a syllogistic expression.
3. The predicator (′v) always appears as a prefix, and always in connection with a
functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring individual vari-
able v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A (v) into a concept
expression, so that ‘(′v) A (v)’ is equivalent to the concept expression ‘object which
is designated by “v” in A (v) and for which A (v) holds’.
4. The universal quantifier (∀v) always appears as a prefix, and always in con-
nection with a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring
individual variable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A
(v) into a universal affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∀v) A (v)’ is
equivalent to the syllogistic expression A ((′v) A (v), ξ).
5. The existential quantifier (∃v) always appears as a prefix, and always in con-
nection with a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring
individual variable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A
(v) into a particular affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∃v) A (v)’ is
equivalent to the syllogistic expression I ((′v) A (v), ξ).
6. The quantifier (∇v) always appears as a prefix, and always in connection with
a functional expression which by itself contains a freely occurring individual var-
iable v. This prefix transforms an open proposition of the form A (v) into a singu-
lar affirmative categorical proposition, so that ‘(∇v) A (v)’ is equivalent to the
syllogistic expression ‘Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ)’.
Remark: The relationship between an open proposition A (v) and one of the ex-
pressions which transforms this proposition into a closed proposition, i.e., the
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 65
263

relationship between A (v) and one of the expressions t, (∀v), (∃v) and (∇v),
corresponds to the relationship between the grammatical predicate and a gram-
matical subject of a categorical proposition. The grammatical subject is, namely,
that part of the proposition which specifies or names that about which a categorical
proposition deals. By contrast, the grammatical predicate is that part of the proposi-
tion which contains what the categorical proposition states about what it deals with
(cf. § 27). Thus, t, (∀v), (∃v) or (∇v) name or specify that about which a certain
categorical proposition deals, namely, taken in sequence: the individual t, every in-
dividual v, some individual v, or precisely the individual v. By contrast, A (v) con-
tains precisely that which is categorically stated about these subjects, namely: that
A (v). (‘A (v)’ here means the same as ‘v is an A’, where ‘v’ only designates an empty
place.)
Hence, the prefix (′v) can be taken as an operator which transforms a gram-
matical predicate A (v) into a logical predicate, i.e., into a concept expression (a
so-called term). Namely, ‘(′x) A x’, ‘(′y) B (y)’, etc. are to be regarded as expressions
which can stand for concept expressions of an arbitrary content, in the same way
as ‘α’, ‘β’, etc. can. In other words, they fulfill the same task as concept variables.
Unlike them, ‘(′x) F x’, ‘(′y) G (y)’, etc. always stand for concept expressions of a
specific content. Namely, these expressions indicate that they correspond exclu-
sively to one-place (monadic) functional expressions ‘F (x)’, ‘G (y)’, etc.
Frege noticed that functions have something to do with concepts and objects
have something to do with arguments of functions. Yet since he confused the
grammatical predicate with the logical predicate and the grammatical subject
with the logical subject, he erroneously believed he could equate concepts with
functions and that ‘F (a)’ expresses not a relation between concepts, but rather
stands for a “logically basic relation” (see §§ 25–28 and §§ 32–35 above).
§ 66 Examples of Contentful Syllogistic Inference
The language of signs discussed in § 65 can be employed directly for the sake of
presenting concrete contentful inferences (not only modes of inference or inference
rules). It goes without saying that all valid rules and modes of inference from §§
53–63 remain valid when concept expressions of the form (′v) A (v), with an arbi-
trary interpretation for A, are substituted for a concept variable (α, β, . . .) in all
places of its occurrence. But there is also a kind of contentful inference whose va-
lidity, though it is based on universally valid basic syllogistic rules, is not derivable
from these as before. Consider as illustration the following inference.
264
Part II Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference

Example:
All circles are figures.
Thus: if someone draws something that is not a figure, then someone draws something that is
not a circle.
This inference can be presented symbolically in such a way that one makes use
only of syllogistic formulas, but in that case a notation like the one discussed in §
65 must be used.
To this end, we can introduce the following conventions for the translation of
the terms ‘circle’ and ‘figure’. The functional sign ‘C (x1)’ abbreviates the open propo-
sition (or the grammatical predicate) ‘. . . is a circle’. Then the formula ‘(′x1) C (x1)’
stands for the specific term ‘circle’. In the same way, ‘F (x1)’ serves to abbreviate the
grammatical predicate ‘. . . is a figure’, so that ‘(′x1) F (x1)’ stands for the specific term
‘figure’. On the basis of these two stipulations, we may render the premise of the
above inference: ‘All circles are figures’ with the formula
‘A ((′x1) F (x1), (′x1) C (x1))’.
In addition, we can render the proposition ‘this object is a circle’ with the formula
‘Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)’,
and, similarly, the proposition ‘if something is a circle, then it is a figure’ with the
formula
‘H (I ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1), Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)’.
Now let the functional sign ‘D (x2, x1)’ abbreviate ‘x2 draws x1’. The expression
‘(′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1)’ is then equivalent to the term ‘drawer of something’,
whereby ‘something’ means a member of the domain which is referenced in the
x2-position of the functional sign that appears in the present context. On the basis
of this further stipulation, we may write for ‘someone draws an object’:
‘I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2))’.
The proposition ‘If someone draws something, then this is not a figure’ can be ex-
pressed by the formula
‘H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2)), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1))’,
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 66
265

so that the proposition, ‘If someone draws something that is not a figure, then
someone draws something that is not a circle’ takes the following shape:
H (H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)),
H (Ạ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1))).
The following proof shows that exclusively syllogistic rules can be brought into
play to make clear the validity of this inference.
Proof:

H (I ((′x2) (∃x1) D (x2, x1), ξ2), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)))

Second example:
All circles are figures.
Thus: if, when something is a figure a has not drawn it, then, when something is a circle, a
has not drawn it.
Symbolically:
A ((′x) F (x), (′x) C (x))
∴H (H (I ((′x) F (x), ξ1), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ξ1)),
H (I ((′x) C (x), ξ1), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ξ1))).

As the example just discussed shows, it is not yet the mere use of functional signs
which leads to an expansion of the domain of deductive logic that breaks open the
limits of the syllogistic. As will be seen further below, and especially after § 72, we
overstep these limits only when we abandon our practice up to now of only accept-
ing such rules which are valid on the basis of definitions alone.
§ 67 Abbreviation Rules
If one assumes the conventions recommended in §§ 64 and 65, syllogistic expressions
can be transformed according to the following rules in such a way that, both concept
variables and conceptual constants become superfluous as required descriptive signs
and the signs for conceptual relations are dispensable as logical constants:
1. Abbreviation for a formula for a singular categorical proposition:
Ạ((′v) A (v), ζ) ≻≺[A (t)]
(V. 1)
2. Abbreviation for a formula for a universal categorical proposition:
A ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∀v) A (v)
(V. 2)
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 67
267

3. Abbreviation for a formula for a particular categorical proposition:
I ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∃v) A (v)
(V. 3)
4. Abbreviation for a formula for a singular categorical proposition:
Ạ((′v) A (v), ξ) ≻≺(∇v) A (v)
(V. 4)
The validity of these eight rules follows directly from the comments given in § 65
and the notation introduced in § 64. Since, according to these comments, quantifiers
are not truly logical constants, but rather only signs that abbreviate syllogistic ex-
pressions of a certain quantity, these rules should not be regarded as principles, but
rather as transformation rules, which serve merely to abbreviate syllogistic expres-
sions for certain categorical propositions with complex predicate expressions.
§ 68 Examples of Contentful Syllogistic Inference (Continued)
We have seen in § 66 that the validity of the inference
All circles are figures.
Thus: if someone draws something that is not a figure, then someone draws something that is
not a circle.
is provable according to syllogistic rules, if one presents it in the following form:
A ((′x1) F (x1), (′x1) C (x1))
∴H (H (I ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1), N Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)),
H (Ạ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1), N Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1))).
According to the transformation rules listed in § 67, the conclusion of this infer-
ence can now be transformed and abbreviated, and this in such a way that all the
concept variables, conceptual constants, and expressions for conceptual relations
that appear in it disappear. For the expression ‘I ((′x1) (∃x2) D (x2, x1), ξ1)’ we may
substitute ‘(∃x) (∃y) D (y, x)’. For ‘Ạ((′x1) C (x1), ξ1)’ and ‘Ạ((′x1) F (x1), ξ1)’, we can
insert the expressions ‘(∇x) C (x)’ and ‘(∇x) F (x)’. We then get:
H (H ((∃x) (∃y) D (y, x), N (∇x) F (x)), H ((∃x) (∃y) D (y, x), N (∇x) C (x)).
One can also arrive at this formula by applying rules (V. 3) and (V. 4) to the last
line of the derivation from § 66.
In just the same way, we can now also present the inference
268
Part II Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference

All circles are figures.
Thus: if, when something is a figure a has not drawn it, then, when something is a circle, a
has not drawn it.
by writing:
A ((′x) F (x), (′x) C (x))
∴H (H ((∃x) F (x), N (∇x) D (a, x)),
H ((∃x) C (x), N (∇x) D (a, x))).
If in addition we want to avoid the use of the signs ‘(∇x) . . .’ and ‘(′x) . . .’, then
we must, with the example inferences considered here, alter both the logical
form of the premises as well as the logical form of the conclusions. This can be
done, for example, first by weakening the categorical form as it appears in the
premises to a hypothetical form and, second, by replacing the bound variables as
they appear in the conclusions in all places with the same individual constant. In
this way, the inference just considered becomes this one:
If something is a circle, then it is a figure;
Therefore: if a, when b is a figure, has not drawn b, then a, when b is a circle, has not drawn b.
or into the inference:
If b is a circle, then b is a figure;
Therefore: if a, when b is a figure, has not drawn b, then a, when b is a circle, has not drawn b.
An inference of this form can also be proven with the syllogistic method of deri-
vation. It has the symbolic form:
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴H (H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)])).
Its validity can be proven as follows:
Proof:
[1] H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2)),
H (Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
∴H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
(II. 13)
[2] H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2))
∴H (H (Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2)),
H (Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2), N Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2))
(II. 1) [1]
Section Five Contentful Syllogistic Inference § 68
269

By substituting ‘[D (a, b)]’, ‘[K (b)]’, and ‘[F (b)]’ for ‘Ạ((′x) D (a, x), ζ2)’, ‘Ạ((′x) C (x), ζ2)’,
and ‘Ạ((′x) F (x), ζ2)’ in line [2] of this derivation, we get the following formula
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴H (H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)])).
We get this formula by applying the transformation rule (V. 1) from § 67 to line [2].
§ 69 Further Abbreviation Rules
We can gain more than the transformation rules of § 67 from the conventions of §
65. They govern the manner of notation for syllogistic expressions in such a way
that further derivation rules can be formulated with them. According to the explana-
tion of the concept expression ‘(′v) A (v)’ in § 65 (3) and the comment on § 65, concept
expressions of the type ‘(′x) A (x)’ are, unlike expressions of the type ‘(′x) F (x)’, inde-
terminate in such a way that they can play the same role as concept variables α, β,
etc. We can thus say that α, β, etc. can substantially play the role of abbreviating
expressions of the type ‘(′v) A (v)’, ‘(′v) B (v)’, etc. In just the same way, the concept
expressions ‘(′v) N A (v)’, ‘(′v) N B (v)’, etc. can be represented by the equivalent
briefer concept expressions Nα, Nβ, etc. Hence, the expressions Y ((′v) A (v), β)
and Y ((′v) N A (v), β), with Y equal to A, I, or Ạ, differ only by their manner of
notation from the expressions Y (α, β) und Y (Nα, β). Because of this equivalence
in meaning, the following rules hold:
Y ((′v) A (v), β) ≻≺Y (α, β) (with Y = A, I, or Ạ)
(V. 5)
Y ((′v) N A (v), β) ≻≺Y (Nα, β) (with Y = A, I, or Ạ)
(V. 6)
These rules are to be considered as abbreviation rules as well.
According to § 53, the rules (III. 8) to (III. 10) hold for expressions of the form
A (Nα, β), I (Nα, β), and Ạ(Nα, β), in sequence. From the application of rules (V. 5)
and (V. 6) to these three rules, rules (V. 7) to (V. 9) result:
A ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N I ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 7)
I ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N A ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 8)
Ạ((′v) N A (v), β) ≺N Ạ((′v) A (v), β)
(V. 9)

Derivation of Formulas within the Framework
of a System Extended Beyond the Limits
of Elementary Deductive Logic
1 Principles and Metalogical Rules
§ 70 Notation
The language of the extended deductive logic, as it will be used in what follows,
differs from the extended language of the syllogistic in § 64, as it has been devel-
oped in the preceding five sections, merely by the use of
(a) the sign of truth functional negation: ‘~ . . .’, and
(b) the subjunction sign: ‘. . . ⊃. . .’.
The formulas A and ~ A may stand in the place of NN A and of N A if H (NN A, A)
is a valid formula (see § 10, § 31, and § 71, definition 4).
The formula A ⊃B may stand in the place of H (A, B) if H (B, H (A, B)) and H
(NN A, A) are valid formulas (see § 31 and § 71, definition 3).
As for the use of square brackets as per § 64 (4), N A (t) (without square
brackets) may replace both N [A (t)], as an abbreviation of N Ạ((′v) A (v), ζ), and
[N A (t)], as an abbreviation of Ạ((′v) N A (v), ζ ), if N [A (t)] occurs in a valid
formula and a second formula is valid which differs from the first only by replac-
ing the sub-formula N [A (t)] in all places of its occurrence in the first formula
with [N A (t)].
§ 71 Definitions
With the following definitions, the meaning of the signs newly introduced in § 70,
‘~ . . .’ and ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, will be reduced to the meaning of the logical constants ‘N . . .’
and ‘H (. . ., . . .)’.
1. A is a formula of the extended deductive logic if and only if B and C are also formu-
las of the extended deductive logic, i.e., they consist of signs which I have introduced
in § 42, § 46, § 51, and § 64, and at least one of the following four conditions is satis-
fied: (a) A is a formula of the categorical, hypothetical, or disjunctive syllogistic, or
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-010

(b) A is a logical functional expression, or (c) A is a subjunction of the form B ⊃C, or
(d) A is a truth-functional negation of the form ~ B.
2. A is a logical functional expression if and only if A is a formula which corre-
sponds to one of the expressions B (t), [B (t)], (∀v) B (v), (∃v) B (v), or (∇v) B (v)
introduced in § 64.
3. A is a subjunction, i.e., an expression of the form B ⊃C, if for every interpreta-
tion in which B and C are true or false propositions, the following condition is
satisfied: A is true if and only if H (B, C) is true and, as per § 72, the postulates of
the arbitrary sufficient reason (i.e., rule (IV. 3)) and the affirmative use of double
negation (i.e., rule (IV. 4)) are valid.
Corollary to Definition 3:
If A and B are formulas of the extended deductive logic and if both A, B ≺A, ac-
cording to (VI. 3), as well as NN A ≺A, according to (VI. 4), are valid rules, then
according to this definition (and because of the equivalence in meaning of ‘H A,
B)’ and ‘N (A, N B)’ (see § 40)), the following rule is valid:
H (A, B) ≻≺A ⊃B.
(VI. 1)
4. A is a truth-functional negation, i.e., an expression of the form ~ B, if for every
interpretation in which B is a true or false proposition, the following holds: A is true
if and only if N B is true and, as per § 72, the postulate of the affirmative use of dou-
ble negation for pairs of propositions of the form B and N B (i.e., rule (IV. 4)) is valid.
Corollary to Definition 4:
If A is a formula of the extended deductive logic, and if NN A ≺A, according to (VI.
4), is a valid rule, so that – on the basis of (II. 29)w (see § 73 below) – H (NN A, A) is a
valid propositional schema, then according to this definition (and according to § 30),
the following rule is valid:
N A ≻≺~ A
(VI. 2)
§ 72 Postulates
1. The postulate of the arbitrary sufficient reason:
Let it hold that:
A, B ≺A
(VI. 3)
272
Part II Section Six An Extended System of Deductive Logic

Scholium: The validity of (VI. 3) does not rest on the validity of a logical constant,
but rather on a mere supposition or on the content of the propositions that A and
B stand for. If A, B ∴A were a valid rule, then also the rules ex quolibet verum and
ex falso quodlibet would be valid. For both A ∴H (B, A) (according to (II. 1)) and A,
N A ∴B (according to (I. 2)) would be derivable (see § 30).218
If B stands for the empty premise set, then (VI. 3) turns into the rule A ≺A. It
says that it is impossible that A is true and N A is false. The reason for this impos-
sibility cannot be a logical one. Otherwise, the expression A ≺A would have to
contain a logical constant on whose meaning the impossibility is supposed to de-
pend. (cf. § 45, scholium).
2. The postulate of the affirmative use of double negation for A and N A:
Let NN A be equivalent with A. That is, let not only (I. 1), but in addition:
NN A ≺A
(VI. 4)
3. The postulate of non-empty domains:
Let it hold both that:
N A (α, β) ≺I (Nα, β), and that:
(VI. 5)
N A (Nα, β) ≺I (α, β)
(VI. 6)
Remark: According to rules (V. 5) and (V. 6) (see § 69), in formulas (VI. 5) and (VI.
6) the variable ‘α’ may be replaced everywhere by ‘(′v) A (v)’, and the expression
‘Nα’ by ‘(′v) N A (v)’.
Scholium: When the validity of (VI. 5) and (VI. 6) is accepted, it is supposed that
the domain of individuals to which propositions of the form N A (α, β) and N A (Nα,
β) refer is not empty (see § 35 above). Namely, the validity of (VI. 5) permits passing
from N A (α, β), N I (α, β), α), or N Ạ(α, β) to I (Nα, β) according to the rules of the
logical square; and a fortiori it permits passing from N (∀v) A (v), N (∃v) A (v), or
from (∇v) A (v) to (∃v) N A (v). Similarly for (VI. 6). Accordingly, only on the as-
sumption of the validity of (VI. 5) and (VI. 6) is it possible to derive a non-negative
existential proposition from the negation of an affirmative proposition. It ultimately
Also Paul Hoyningen-Huene (1998, 124) seems not to want to acknowledge the general validity
of the rule according to which A follows from A and B; in his view, it is enough rather “to restrict its
applicability to those cases in which B is different from ~ A“, and then to “justify” that “nothing”
(not even A or ~ A) “follows from A & ~ A”. Since this view is excluded by the truth table for A & ~ A,
it seems that Hoyningen hereby tacitly agrees to the assumption that there must be a non-truth-
functional logical conjunction of premises.
1 Principles and Metalogical Rules § 72
273

rests on this fact that valid existential formulas, i.e., formulas of the type (∃v) A (v),
can be derived within the extended deductive logic.219
Only postulates (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) guarantee that every formula of the system of
the extended deductive logic, provided they contain no free individual variables,
can be given a gapless truth table.
The postulate of non-empty domains, which is expressed in rules (VI. 5) and
(VI. 6), guarantees that all descriptive signs of the extended deductive logic have a
definite semantic value, so that individual symbols always refer to objects of a sat-
isfied domain. By contrast, a similar semantic value is not fixed for the descriptive
signs of the elementary syllogistic. Nothing guarantees that syllogistic concept ex-
pressions stand for satisfiable, not to mention satisfied, concepts.
The fact that basic rules (VI. 3) to (VI. 6) are mere postulates means that proposi-
tions correspond to them from whose negation no inconsistency is derivable. Such
propositions can be generated from them through conditionalization (according to
(II. 29)w) (see § 73) and subsequent interpretation. Proposition from whose negation
no inconsistency is derivable are, according to § 39, to be regarded as non-analytic
(i.e., as synthetic) propositions, and, so long they are not empirical propositions, as
non-analytic propositions a priori.
One can raise the question of under which circumstances it is really appropri-
ate to accept the rules (VI. 3) to (VI. 6) as valid postulates. The answer is: when it
may be assumed that the domain to which individual constants and quantified in-
dividual variables refers is not empty, it may be postulated that these basic rules
are valid. This assumption may be made, e.g., in the application of the logical cal-
culus of functions in arithmetic and geometry, namely, when in this application
individual signs become signs for objects whose existence or givenness (as num-
bers, quantities, line segments, etc.) is assumed. In this application, basic rules
(VI. 3) to (VI. 6) turn into mathematical postulates whose validity neither needs nor
is capable of proof. This holds directly for (VI. 5) and (VI. 6), but indirectly for rules
(VI. 3) and (VI. 4) as well. For if it is ruled out that singular propositions have no
existential presuppositions, then it is also ruled out that propositions of the form Ạ
(α, β) do not follow from propositions of the form NN Ạ(α, β), and hence that prop-
ositions of the form A do not follow from propositions of the form NN A. Thus, in
that case (VI. 4) holds. But then (VI. 3) holds as well, for if it is supposed to hold
always that A follows from NN A, then it should also hold that there is no pair of
propositions which are related as A and NN A and yet at the same time both negate
a false proposition, so that as such they are both true. With this it is postulated that
Examples of such existential formulas are (∃y) (F (y) ⊃(∀x) F (x)), (∃y) ((∃x) F (x) ⊃F (y)),
or (∃y) ((∀x) F (x) ⊃F (y)). See on this § 80, theorem (15). Cf. Quine 1963, 160–67.
274
Part II Section Six An Extended System of Deductive Logic

there is no proposition which is true in one respect (insofar as it negates a false
proposition), while it is false in another respect (insofar as it is negated by a true
proposition). According to this postulate, there should only be propositions of
which it may also be supposed that they (either alone or in conjunction with other
propositions) follow from themselves.220
§ 73 Metalogical Rules
According to § 72, the extended deductive logic, in contrast to the syllogistic, makes
use of rules whose validity does not rest on definitions, but is only postulated. These
rules thus deal not with relations of logical consequence, but rather only with rela-
tions of regular consequence (see § 43, definitions 3 and 4). Hence, to derive rules
from these postulates one needs metalogical rules which can be regarded for the
most part as analogous variants of the metalogical rules I introduced above, in §§
44 to 50, which are applicable to relations of logical consequence. Precisely analo-
gous rules hold for relations of regular consequence, since logical consequence is
only a special case of regular consequence (see § 43, definition 4). To be able to re-
duce relations of regular consequence to other relations of regular consequence, it
suffices to reformulate the metalogical basic rules (I. 2) (reductio ad absurdum), (I. 3)
(Peripatetic inference chain rule), and (II. 1) (principle of conditionalization) so that
the sign ‘∴’ is replaced in all places of its occurrence with the sign ‘≺’. We then get
three new expressions that stand for reduction rules, for (I. 2)w, (I. 3)w, and (II. 1)w,
to which finally the weakening rule (VI. 7) is added:
1. Metalogical basic rules
Reductio ad absurdum – variant on (I. 2):
(A1, . . ., An ≺A) / (N A, A1, . . ., An–1 ≺N An), . . .,
(N A, A2, . . ., An ≺N A1) (with n ≧1)
(I. 2)w221
Peripatetic inference chain rule – variant on (I. 3):
(Ak, . . ., An ≺A), (A, B1, . . ., Bm ≺B) / (Ak, . . ., An, B1, . . ., Bm ≺B)
(with k ≧0, n ≧k and m ≧1)
(I. 3)w
Basic rules (VI. 3) to (VI. 6), as postulates, regulate the mathematical use of letters as such, and, like
the so-called postulates of Euclidean geometry, they have to guarantee that their concepts are satisfied.
The superscripted lowercase letter w stands here and in what follows for ‘weakened’. The
weakening of rule (I. 2)w vis-à-vis the analogous rule (I. 2) consists in replacing the sign for logical
consequence in all places of its occurrence with that of regular consequence.
1 Principles and Metalogical Rules § 73
275

Principle of conditionalization – variant on (II. 1):
A1, . . ., An, B ≺C / A1, . . ., An ≺H (B, C)
(II. 1)w
Scholium: The reasons these three rules are valid are not different from the reasons
the rules (I. 2), (I. 3), and (II. 1) are valid. For (I. 2)w is valid because it is true per
definitionem of regular consequence just as of logical consequence that the conse-
quent cannot be false unless at least one of the premises is false; (I. 3)w is valid be-
cause both the regular as well as the logical consequence relations are transitive;
and (II. 1)w is valid because the definition of the hypothetical proposition (see § 47,
definition 2 above) refers to the relation of regular consequence of which the rela-
tion of logical consequence is only a special case (see § 42, definitions 3 and 4).
Weakening of logical consequence:
A1, . . ., An ∴B / A1, . . ., An ≺B (with n ≧1)
(VI. 7)
The validity of (VI. 7) rests on the fact that logical consequence, according to § 43,
definitions 3 and 4, is a special case of regular consequence.
Note on Notation:
To abbreviate, in what the following derivations (as also up to now) I will add the
superscripted lowercase letter w (as an abbreviation for ‘weakened’) in the right
column of a line, after the designation of a rule. This letter is placed here to indi-
cate that two lines of a derivation, of which the second relies on the application
of (VI. 7), have been combined into one line. For example, the two lines
[n]
A ∴NN A
(I. )
[n + m]
A ≺NN A (with m ≧)
(VI. ) []
may be replaced by the following line:
[n]
A ≺NN A
(I. )w
2. Derivable metalogical rules
From the metalogical basic rules (I. 2)w, (I. 3)w, and (II. 1)w rules can be derived
which are precisely analogous to the metalogical rules (I. 4), (I. 5), (II. 5), and (II. 6)
as well as rules (II. 29) and (II. 30), and which differ from them only by the ap-
pearance of ‘≺’ in place of ‘∴’. They are the following:
Simple transitivity in an inference chain – variant on (I. 4):
(Ai, . . ., Ak ≺B), (B, C ≺D) / Ai, . . ., Ak, C ≺D (with i ≧0, k ≧i)

Complex transitivity in an inference chain – variant on (I. 5):
(Ai, . . ., Ak ∴A), (Ak+1, . . ., An ≺B1), (A, B1 ≺D) / A1, . . ., An ≺D

The derivations which can be carried out for (I. 4)w, (I. 5)w, (II. 5)w, (II. 6)w, (II. 29)w,
and (II. 30)w are precisely analogous to the proofs which have been carried out
above in § 45, § 49, and § 50 for the validity of rules (I. 4), (I. 5), (II. 6), (II. 29), and
(II. 30), respectively.

§ 74 Derivation of Truth-Functional Rules
If A, B, and C are formulas of the extended deductive logic in the sense of § 71,
definition 1, then the following rules (VI. 8) to (VI. 16) are derivable from the prin-
ciples established above:
Simple detachment rule:
A ⊃B, A ≺B
(VI. 8)222
Proof:
[]
H (A, B), A ≺B
(II. )w
[]
A ⊃B, A ≺B
(VI. ) []
Complex detachment rule:
(A ⊃B), (B ⊃C), A ≺C
(VI. 9)
In logic books, A, A ⊃B ∴B and A, A ⊃B ≺B are not usually distinguished, and thus it is not
noticed that, taken strictly, A, A ⊃B ∴B is not a valid rule. There is also the habit of confusing
A, A ⊃B ∴B or A, A ⊃B ≺B with modus ponendo ponens (II. 2). In this way, the distinction between
H (A, B) and A ⊃B is overlooked. Frege (1879/1967, § 6) goes as far as designating his derivation
rule, which likewise resembles expression (VI. 8), as “modus ponens,” as if ultimately even the
distinction between modus ponendo ponens and modus tollendo ponens should remain unnoticed.

[]
[A (t)] ≺(∀v) A (v)
(I. )w [, , ]
The proof is not yet completed here, since the square brackets in line [6] must still
disappear. Indeed, ‘A (t)’ and ‘[A (t)]’ are not equivalent, according to § 64 (4). If A
equals N B, then it is not proven with line [6] that (∀v) N B (v) follows from N [B (t)].
At that point, it is only proven that (∀v) N B (v) follows regularly from [N B (t)].
Hence, the proof for (VI. 10) is only completed when the formula N [B (t)] ≺(∀v) N B
(v) is derived as well. This derivation can be performed in the following way:
[’]
Ạ((′v) B (v), ζ) ≺[B (t)]

(I. )w [’, ’, ’, ’, ’]
The (not unrestrictedly admissible) application of (III. 3), i.e., the first exposition
rule, is permitted in lines [2] and [6’], since ‘ξ’ occurs in the place of a concept
variable neither in the premise expression of line [1], nor in one of the premise
expressions of lines [1’] to [5’]. This can be made clear from the formulas abbrevi-
ated by A (t) and (∀v) A (v), namely the formulas Ạ((′v) B (v), ζ) and N Ạ((′v) B
(v), ζ) and the formulas A ((′v) A (v), ξ) and A ((′v) N B (v), ξ), respectively, between
which takes place the transition made possible by (III. 3). In this way, these for-
mulas differ from the expressions that abbreviate them, namely the expressions
A (t) and (∀v) A (v), which occur in the formula for rule (VI. 10). With reference
to these expressions, if rule (VI. 10) is supposed to be valid, it must be stipulated
that the letter t – and with that implicitly the concept expression ζ as well – does
278
Part II Section Six An Extended System of Deductive Logic

not occur even once in the functional expression A (t) other than in its argument
places (which are designated by ‘v’ in ‘(∀v) A (v)’). This stipulation guarantees that
‘t’ in the transition from A (t) to ‘(∀v) A (v)’ is replaced by ‘v’, just as ‘ζ’ is by ‘ξ’.
Rule of posterior generalization:
In case t occurs only in the argument places of B (t), then:
(A ⊃B (t)) ≺(A ⊃(∀v) B (v))

§ 75 Derivation of Truth-Functional Laws
If A, B, and C are formulas of the extended deductive logic in the sense of § 73, defini-
tion 1, then the following truth-functions (VI. 17) to (VI. 27), for example, are derivable
from the principles established above. The expressions (VI. 17) to (VI. 24) – apart from
(VI. 23) – correspond to seven of the nine “fundamental principles” which Frege estab-
lished in Part II of his Begriffsschrift as axioms of his system of “laws of thought” and
which he called its “core.”223 The two axioms which I leave aside here differ from the
others in that they contain the sign of “identity of content” (‘≡’), which Frege replaced
in later writings by the ordinary identity sign (‘=’). They are rendered by the formulas
‘⊢(c = d) ⊃(A (c) ⊃A (d)’ and ‘⊢c = d’ in §§ 20 and 21 of the Begriffsschrift.

(VI. 23)
(VI. 21) and (VI. 23) are here strictly speaking only proven for A ≠N B (for arbitrary B). But
the generalization is admissible in both cases, since N B ≺NNN B is directly derivable from (VI.
4) with the help of (I. 2)w, so that N A may be substituted for A in every line of both proofs.

The expression (VI. 24) corresponds to the ninth axiom in § 22 of Frege’s Begriffs-
schrift. Instead of ‘✶≺’ Frege uses the sign ‘⊢’. But that sign means something else,
namely: that the expression standing to the right of it renders a truth (Frege 1879, 2,
§ 1 [1967, 11]) or corresponds to a ‘fact’ (Frege 1879, 4, § 3 [1967, 13]). Thus, it designa-
tes a property of all formulas which render a truth-functional law. This property is
the result of the fact that it is impossible for each of these formulas according to (VI.
24) to contain an empty term, and it is guaranteed for each of these formulas accord-
ing to (VI. 17) to (VI. 22) that it cannot have any other value (as a functional value)
than the value T under any distribution of the truth-values T and F on A, B or C.

§ 76 Contentful Inference
First example:
We have seen above, in § 68, that the validity of the inference
If b is a circle, then b is a figure;
Therefore: if a, when b is a figure, has not drawn b, then a, when b is a circle, has not drawn b.
is valid and that it corresponds to the form
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴H (H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)])).
Neither an inference of this form, nor an inference from categorical propositions,
as, e.g., the inference treated in § 66:
All circles are figures.
Thus: if, when something is a figure a has not drawn it, then, when something is a circle, a
has not drawn it, –
can be expressed in the language of the calculus of functions, since categorical or
hypothetical propositional forms cannot be presented in this language.
However, it is certainly possible to present sound inferences in this language
that are quite similar. If, e.g., we replace in the just described inferences the logi-
cal constants ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ and ‘N . . .’ everywhere with ‘. . . ⊃. . .’ and ‘~ . . .’, and
286
Part II Section Six An Extended System of Deductive Logic

we replace the sign for logical consequence with the sign for regular conse-
quence, then we get from the inference mentioned first the following one:
[C (b)] ⊃[F (b)])
≺([F (b)] ⊃~ D (a, b)) ⊃([C (b)] ⊃~ D (a, b)).
Or in words:
b is not a circle unless b is a figure;
therefore: it is not the case that b is not a figure unless a has not drawn b, unless it is the case
that b is not a circle unless a has not drawn b.
By generalization, this inference can be additionally transformed into the inference:
[K (b)] ⊃[F (b)])
≺([F (b)] ⊃~ G (a, b)) ⊃([K (b)] ⊃~ G (a, b)).
In words:
For all x: x is not a circle unless x is a figure;
therefore: for all y: there is an x such that x is a circle and y has drawn x not unless there is
an x such that x is a figure and y has drawn x.
However, it is worth mentioning that such an inference which relies on truth func-
tions is only valid if one understands the little word ‘therefore’ as expression of
regular consequence, rather than logical consequence (in the sense of § 44, defini-
tions 3 and 4), and thus does not replace the sign ‘≺’ with ‘∴’. We can see this by
paying attention to the rules according to which the inference considered in § 68
H ([C (b)], [F (b)])
∴(H ([F (b)], N [D (a, b)], H ([C (b)], N [D (a, b)]))
can be transformed into the inference
(∀x) (C (x) ⊃F (x))
≺(∀y) ((∃x) (C (x) & D (y, x)) ⊃(∃x) (F (x) & D (y, x)).
Essential among these rules are rules whose validity is postulated according to §
72 or which depends on the postulates of § 72 (according to § 74 and § 75). Let us
consider this transformation, in which the rules (VI. 1), (VI. 2), (VI. 8), and (VI. 15)
are applied, step by step. To make for an easier overview, I replace the expressions
‘[C (b)]’, ‘[F (b)]’, and ‘[D (a, b)]’ from line [2] with the letters ‘c’, ‘f’, ‘d’, in sequence:
[]
H (c, f)
≺H (H (f, N d), H (c, N d))
[]

[]
(c ⊃f)
≺H (H (f, N d), H (c, N d))

[]
(∀x) (C (x) ⊃F (x)) ≺(c ⊃f)

A (v)’ and ‘~ (. . . & ~ . . .)’ is equivalent to ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, the consequence in line [50] is
equivalent to:
(∀x) (C (x) ⊃F (x))
≺(∀y) ((∃x) (C (x) & D (y, x)) ⊃(∃x) (F (x) & D (y, x)).225
Second example:
There is something of which everything consists.
Therefore: everything consists of something.
If we replace ‘. . . ≺. . .’ with ‘. . . ∴. . .’, we then get the – somewhat less accurate – expres-
sion which Quine (1959, § 30) offers for the inference, which has been much-discussed since the
medieval period (as an example of a non-syllogistic consequence), ‘All circles are figures; there-
fore, all who draw circles, draw figures’.

The validity of this inference is provable if it is specified as follows, letting ‘F (x, y)’
abbreviate for ‘x consists of y’:
(∃y) (∀x) F (x, y) ≺(∀x) (∃y) F (x, y)
Although in this inference, unlike in the first example, no truth functions occur
directly but only an exchange of quantifiers, its validity can be proven on the as-
sumption of rules whose validity is postulated according to § 72 or according to
§ 74 or § 75, which rely on § 72. As the following proof shows, these are the rules
(VI. 1), (VI. 2), (VI. 4), (VI. 5), (VI. 10), and (VI. 15). Because of these rules, the sign ‘≺’
should not be replaced with ‘∴’.

Within the framework of the calculus of functions (i.e., in classical predicate logic)
there are of course much shorter and simpler methods for the validity proofs of
the two examples of contentful inference discussed here. Here, in § 76, it is not

supposed to be shown that there is a more cumbersome and complicated method.
Rather, the examples should make clear that even for categorical propositions
with a low complexity of conceptual content, the number of logical steps underly-
ing inferences related to this content can be very great. In the shorter and simpler
methods used in classical predicate logic these steps take place covertly.

Part II Section Six An Extended System of Deductive Logic

Section Seven
Provability and Derivability within the Logical
Calculus of Functions
§ 77 Notation
The system of the extended deductive logic, as far as I have unfolded it in Section
Six, contains a series of transformation rules and meaning rules which allow us
to present this system in a reduced symbolic language, in which no syllogistic
rule can be expressed but rules which do not belong to the syllogistic can be. This
reduction of the symbolic language consists in restricting its use to a relatively
small set of descriptive and logical signs.
Concerning the descriptive signs, in this reduced language all symbols which
are used directly to present a conceptual content are set aside. On the basis of the
abbreviations introduced above for propositions whose conceptual content can
be rendered with logical functional expressions (in the sense of § 71, def. 2), rules
of the extended deductive logic can be presented in a way which makes all the
concept variables introduced in § 51 dispensable. All conceptual constants intro-
duced in § 64 are dispensable in this manner of presentation as well. The same
holds, finally, for all kinds of concept expressions which were defined in § 65 and
§ 71 and which rely on the use of a prefix, namely on the use of the predicator,
which has thus now become superfluous as well.
We can also significantly reduce the arsenal of signs with respect to the re-
maining prefixes. On the basis of the logical relations between the universal and
existential quantifier (assuming postulates (VI. 5) and (VI. 6)), it is possible to do
without one of these two quantifiers entirely. Thus, ‘(∃x) ( )’ may be replaced ev-
erywhere with ‘~ (∀x) ~ ( )’ (on the basis of (VI. 26) and (VI. 27)).
In addition, on the assumption of postulates (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) it has become pos-
sible to replace the sign for elementary negation everywhere with truth-functional
negation. The logical constants that denote hypothetical and disjunctive propositions
are also replaceable with truth-functional signs on this assumption. The type and
number of truth-functional signs which must be in use for this replacement depends
of course on which modes of abbreviation are to be utilized. In Section Six, ‘ . . . ⊃
. . .’ and ‘~ . . .’ were introduced as the only truth-functional signs. One could now
use ‘A & B’ to abbreviate ‘~ (A ⊃~ B)’ and replace ‘A ⊃B’ with ‘~ (A & ~ B)’. Moreover,
additional abbreviations could be introduced, for example, ‘A ∨B’ for ‘~ A ⊃B’, or ‘A
≡B’ for ‘(A ⊃B) & (B ⊃A)’, or ‘A | B’ for ‘~ (A & B)’. In any case, one could make do
with two connectives. Since ‘~ A’ is equivalent to ‘A | A’ and ‘(A & B)’ to ‘(A | B) | (A |
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-011

B)’, it would even be possible to get by with a single connective (i.e., the Sheffer
stroke).
Formulas which contain only signs of the just described simplified and re-
duced language of the expanded deductive logic will be designated in what fol-
lows by metalogical signs A1, A2, . . ., An, or A, B, ℭ. A will thus be a formula in
which only functional expressions and propositional letters (‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, etc.) occur
as descriptive signs, only simplified (i.e., appearing without square brackets and
without quantifiers) expressions of the form B (t) or B (v) occur as expressions
for non-quantified or singular propositions, and finally only quantifiers or truth-
functional connectives occur as logical signs. The reduced language to which
these formulas belong I call the language of the logical calculus of functions. All
axiomatic systems of the logical calculus of functions make use of such a lan-
guage. They differ essentially from each other only by making use of different
numbers and different kinds of quantifiers and connectives.
As for the remaining metalogical signs, the signs ‘(. . .) ⊦. . .’ and ‘(. . .) ⊨. . .’
are both needed in what follows; their meaning will be defined below, in § 79 and
§ 81.
§ 78 An Axiomatic System of the Logical Calculus of Functions
In the reduced language of the logical calculus of functions, logical rules can no
longer be derived from principles in the same way as I have done up to now (in
§§ 45–75). My derivation procedure to this point consisted essentially in applying
metarules to rules, and ultimately to basic rules. Above, I called this procedure the
syllogistic method of derivation. The axiomatic derivation procedure differs from
this method in that it assumes a certain number of basic formulas (which do not
express rules) as a system of axioms or axiom schemata, in order to apply appropri-
ate derivation rules to these basic formulas and to derive other formulas from them.
The only rules that are considered appropriate derivation rules are those which,
first, are not metarules and, second, are formulated in the same language in which
the axioms or axiom schemata are formulated as well.
As for the system of basic formulas to which the axiomatic derivation proce-
dure is applied, Frege was the first to establish such a system in his Begriffsschrift of
1879. It encompasses (apart from two axioms which have identity relations as their
content) in total seven axioms, the content of which corresponds to the content of
the formulas (VI. 17) to (VI. 22) and (VI. 24), as developed above (see § 75), but with
the difference that Frege’s axioms contain propositional letters or functional expres-
sions instead of the metalogical signs ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’. Consequently, his logical system
requires establishing substitution rules, which would be superfluous if, instead of
294
Part II Section Seven The Logical Calculus of Functions

Frege’s expressions, axiom schemata were used as basic rules, i.e., expressions that
correspond formally precisely to the formulas (VI. 17) to (VI. 22) and (VI. 24) as well.
It has been shown that Frege’s axiom system can also be simplified in another
respect. Frege’s third axiom (see Frege 1879/1967, § 16), which corresponds to for-
mula (VI. 19), has turned out to be superfluous, after Jan Łukasiewicz (1935, 111–31,
especially 126) showed that it is derivable from the first two axioms, which corre-
spond to the formulas (VI. 17) and (VI. 18). Moreover, it has been shown that for-
mula (VI. 23) is suitable to replace the formulas (VI. 20), (VI. 21), and (VI. 22), which
correspond, in sequence, to the fourth, fifth, and sixth axioms in Frege’s system
(see Begriffsschrift §17 to § 19). Frege’s system of axioms can thus be replaced by
the following system of four axiom schemata in total, of which the fourth corre-
sponds on the one hand to Frege’s ninth axiom, on the other hand to formula (VI.
24) (see Frege 1879/1967, § 22):226
A ⊃(B ⊃A)
(VI. 17)✶
(A ⊃(B ⊃ℭ)) ⊃((A ⊃B) ⊃(A ⊃ℭ))
(VI. 18)✶
(~ A ⊃~ B) ⊃(B ⊃A)
(VI. 23)✶
(∀v) A (v) ⊃A (t).
(VI. 24)✶
Concerning the derivation rules which are needed to be able to deduce other for-
mulas from this system of formulas, one can make do with two rules in total. We
can gain these rules, just like the four axiom schemata (VI. 17)✶to (VI. 24)✶, by
merely transforming expressions which I have already introduced above. Namely,
from formula (VI. 8) we get the formula (VI. 8),✶as the expression for a rule which
is called a ‘detachment rule’ in traditional nomenclature:
A, A ⊃B ≺B.
(VI. 8)✶
We gain the second detachment rule on the basis of (VI. 11). It is usually called the
‘rule of posterior generalization’:
In case t only occurs in the argument places of B (t), then:
(A ⊃B (t)) ≺( A ⊃(∀v) B (v)).
(VI. 11)✶
Both the detachment rule as well as the rule of posterior generalization are utilized
in Frege’s Begriffsschrift as derivation rules (see Frege 1879/1967, § 6 and § 11). In
addition, Frege utilizes a still further generalization rule. This one corresponds to
rule (VI. 10) (see Frege 1879/1967, § 11):
In case t only occurs in the argument places of A (t), then:
Cf. on this system the presentation by Ansgar Beckermann (1997, 272–301). On the history of
the simplification of Frege’s logical system, see Kneale & Kneale 1975, 534–35.

A (t) ≺(∀v) A (v).
(VI. 10)✶
But (VI. 10)✶can be derived, like all the remaining rules that are admissible within
the calculus of functions, with the aid of derivation rules (VI. 8)✶and (VI. 11)✶from
the system of the four formulas (VI. 17)✶, (VI. 18)✶, (VI. 23)✶, and (VI. 24)✶. What it
means for a rule to be admissible within the calculus of functions will come
through with the definitions. These definitions fix the structure for the axiomatic
calculus that is based on the system of four axiom schemata and two derivation
rules just sketched.227 This axiomatic calculus is to be called FC.

If the formula A is deducible, so that it holds that: A1, A2, . . ., An ⊦A, then the
rule A1, A2, . . ., An ≺A is called admissible in FC.
§ 80 Theorems of the Calculus of Functions
Because of these seven definitions, there is an essential difference in what was called
a proof in §§ 45–75 and what may be called a proof within an axiomatically con-
structed logical calculus. We can illustrate this difference by presenting some theo-
rems and derivability claims which can hold as provable in the framework of FC.
First of all, each of the formulas (VI. 17)✶to (VI. 24)✶(in § 78) is per definitio-
nem a theorem in the sense of § 79, definition 4. For any law-formula of this
kind – call it A – can be derived from itself by means of the rule of detachment,
since A is derivable from A and A ⊃A. Therefore, we may regard the axioms
(VI. 17)✶to (VI. 24)✶as theorems as well and may thus at once write:
⊦A ⊃(B ⊃A)
(1)
⊦(A ⊃(B ⊃ℭ)) ⊃((A ⊃B) ⊃(A ⊃ℭ))
(2)
⊦(~ A ⊃~ B) ⊃(B ⊃A)
(3)
⊦(∀v) A (v) ⊃A (t)
(4)
From these first four theorems, further formulas can be derived, with the applica-
tion of the detachment rule and the rule of posterior generalization, which are
partly theorems and partly express the deducibility of one formula from one or
more other formulas; for example, the following:

can thus look as if the content of postulate (VI. 4) is provable within the calculus of functions. To
avoid this confusion, one must notice the distinction between simple negation N A and truth-
functional negation, ~ A.

Instead of assuming the validity of the rule of posterior generalization in an axi-
omatic logical calculus in order to be able to carry out derivations within the cal-
culus, it is just as possible to assume the validity of the generalization rule (14)
and carry out the corresponding proofs with it. The validity of the rule of poste-
rior generalization can be proven on this basis. This rule corresponds, as said be-
fore, to the following derivability claim:

Admittedly, to justify the move from line [4] to [5], a supposition must be brought
in which for its part needs a proof; and it is provable within the framework of an
axiomatic system that differs from FC only by assuming rule (14) instead of (VI. 11)✶.
This proof may be left aside here because of its complexity.229 The supposition that
we must make is the deduction theorem (introduced by Tarski and so named by
him). It can be formulated in the following way:
If the formula B is deducible from the elements of a set Γ of formulas of the calculus of
functions and a formula A, so that it holds that: Γ, A ⊦B, and so that it also holds that: Γ ⊦A
⊃B, then the deducibility of B from A and the elements of Γ does not rest on an applica-
tion of the generalization rule (14) to a formula ℭ(t), for which it holds that: ℭ(t) depends
on A and t occurs in A.
Since, as line [3] of the preceding proof implies, B (t) is derivable according to the
detachment rule from A ⊃B (t) and A, the deduction theorem permits deriving

the formula A ⊃(v) B (v) in line [5] from the formula A ⊃B (t) in line [1] in case
t only occurs in the argument places of B (t). This permission corresponds pre-
cisely to what is allowed by the rule of posterior generalization.
§ 81 Soundness and Completeness
The fact that for the formulas (1) to (16) just considered, as for other formulas of
the calculus of functions, there is an axiomatic, non-syllogistic proof still says noth-
ing about whether there are also among these formulas such which are logically
true or follow logically from other formulas. Rather, such a claim is usually made
with two theorems, both of which in turn require a proof. The first of these theo-
rems is the so-called soundness theorem. In its typical formulation, it is supposed
to determine under which conditions a theorem that can be proven within a cer-
tain axiomatic calculus of functions is also logically true, and under which condi-
tions a formula follows logically from another formula. In this formulation, with
reference to the axiomatic system FC, it reads:
The axiomatic calculus of functions FC is sound, i.e., it holds for arbitrary formulas A, A1,
. . ., An:
(a)
If A is a theorem of FC, so that it holds that A is provable (symbolically expressed: ⊦A),
then A is logically true (symbolically expressed: ⊨A).
(b)
If A is derivable from the formulas A1, . . ., An in FC (if it thus holds that: A1, . . ., An ⊦
A), and if in addition in at least one deduction of A from A1, . . ., An the rule of poste-
rior generalization is not applied to a formula B ⊃ℭ[ai], which in this deduction de-
pends on a premise in which the individual constant ai occurs, then A follows logically
from A1, . . ., An (i.e., symbolically expressed, it holds that: A1, . . ., An ⊨A).
The second theorem is the completeness theorem, which contains the inverse of
the claims of the soundness theorem. In one of its usual formulations, it reads:
The axiomatic calculus of functions is complete, that is, for arbitrary formulas A, A1, . . .,
An, it holds that:
(a)
If A is logically true, then A is provable in FC, i.e., A is a theorem in FC. (Symbolically
expressed: if ⊨A, then also ⊦A)
(b)
If A follows logically from A1, . . ., An, then A is derivable in FC from the formulas A1,
. . ., An. (Symbolically expressed: if A1, . . ., An ⊨A, then An ⊦A)
The Logical Calculus of Functions § 81
301

Here, too, I will leave aside the proofs that can be carried out for both theo-
rems.230 It is assumed here that they can be carried out in all strictness.
The concepts of logical truth and logical consequence as introduced here are
called ‘syntactic concepts’. They are called syntactic because they are used to de-
termine logical truth and logical consequence without referring to anything other
than the syntactic relations within the axiomatic system we have considered.
They coincide, however, with the so-called ‘semantic concepts’ of logical truth
and logical consequence, since according to the latter concepts the same theorems
can be understood as logically true and the same rules can be understood as rules
of logical consequence. The latter concepts are called semantic because they refer
only to the meaning attached to the logical vocabulary used in the logical calculus
of functions to determine logical truth and consequence. Thus, according to this
determination, the logical truth of theorems of FC, as well as the logical conse-
quence according to the rules of FC, is based on the meaning of the logical signs
‘~ . . .’, ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, and ‘(∀. . .) . . .’, which occur in these theorems and rules. How-
ever, this meaning depends exclusively on the content of the empty places within
these expressions, namely, on a certain distribution of truth values to these pla-
ces. Thus, the following holds for the three logical signs in FC:
If A is a truth-functional negation, i.e., a proposition of the form ~ B (in words: ‘not B‘),
then A is true if and only if B is false.
If A is a truth-functional conditional proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form B ⊃ℭ
(in words: ‘B, not unless ℭ’), then A is true if and only if B is false or ℭis true.
If A is a universal proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form (∀v) B (v) (in words: ‘For
every v B (v) holds’), then A is true if and only if an individual variable v bound by the
quantifier can be assigned objects of a non-empty domain of individuals in such a way that
B (v) is a true proposition.
According to the semantic concepts of logical truth and logical consequence, the
corresponding points hold in FC:
A proposition A is logically true (symbolically expressed: ⊨A) if and only if its truth results
exclusively from the occurrence of the logical constants ‘~ . . .’, ‘ . . . ⊃. . .’, and ‘(∀. . .)’ in A.
A proposition A follows logically from arbitrary propositions (symbolically expressed:
A1, . . ., An ⊨A) if and only if its truth results exclusively from the occurrence of the logical
constants ‘~ . . .’, ‘ . . . ⊃. . .’, and ‘(∀. . .)’ in A1, . . ., An and A.
What should be maintained about the concepts of logical consequence and logical
truth as used here? Let us consider them separately.
Now, it is obvious that neither the syntactic nor the semantic concept of logi-
cal consequence in FC coincides with the concept of logical consequence in § 43.
Compare here again Beckermann 1997, 287–301.
302
Part II Section Seven The Logical Calculus of Functions

The symbolic expression ‘A1, . . ., An ⊨A’ does not represent the same kind of
logical consequence as ‘A1, . . ., An ∴A’. This discrepancy is due to the fact that
the language of the axiomatic calculus of functions differs from the language of
the extended deductive logical system (presented in §§ 70 to 76) in that the logical
vocabulary of the syllogistic no longer occurs in FC. Consequently, this calculus
does not let one recognize that its axioms, theorems and rules of derivation agree
in their content with expressions derived in §§ 70 to 76 from syllogistic principles,
partly according to syllogistic rules, partly by means of the rules whose validity has
been postulated in § 72. For this derivation it was appropriate to transform rules of
logical consequence according to § 43 (by ‘weakening’) into rules of merely regular
consequence (see §§ 71 and 73) in order to make the relations of regular conse-
quence expressed by the postulates of § 72 transitive and to make syllogistic rules of
logical consequence applicable to them. This transformation ‘by weakening’ in no
way suspends the validity of syllogistic rules of logical consequence. Rather, the oc-
currence of syllogistic rules called ‘weakened’ indicates that the system of extended
deductive logic presupposes the validity of syllogistic rules according to which logi-
cal consequence in the sense of § 43 takes place. This means that the axiomatic cal-
culus of functions also presupposes this validity, just as it depends on the rules of
merely regular consequence postulated as valid in § 72.
Therefore, since this calculus depends not only on syllogistic principles, but
also on the postulates in § 72, its use of an expression of the form ‘A1, . . ., An ⊨A’
does not express that A follows logically from A1, . . ., An in the sense of § 43. If it
did, the reasons for logical consequence here would have to be the same as those
reasons on which ‘A1, . . ., An ∴A’ holds. The relation indicated by ‘. . . ⊨. . .’ is only
a sub-kind of logical consequence, which could be called ‘logical consequence in
FC’. This label is appropriate because there are different kinds of logical conse-
quence. For there are different axiomatic logical calculi, and these differ from each
other by not accepting each of the postulates of § 72 (see appendix 6).
As regards the syntactic as well as the semantic concept of logical truth, the
axiomatic calculus of functions is characterized by the fact that its propositional
vocabulary is truth-functional. The meanings of the signs for negation and con-
ditionality can therefore be defined directly by truth tables, namely in this way:
A ~ . . .
AB
. . . ⊃. . .
T
F

These tables show that the meanings of ‘~ . . .’ and ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, as functional val-
ues, depend on nothing else than the content of the empty places in each case,
namely on a certain distribution of truth values to them. In this respect the logical
vocabulary of the axiomatic calculus of functions differs from that of the syllogis-
tic. There can be nothing in the syllogistic that corresponds to the symbolism (in-
spired by Frege’s use of the sign ‘⊦’)231 according to which ‘⊨A’ means: ‘A is
logically true’. To be sure, ‘✶∴. . .’ has been used in Part II of this essay in a simi-
lar way as ‘⊨. . .’ (as well as the weakened form ‘✶≺. . .’). For as a sign for the
logical consequence of A from the empty set of premises, ‘✶∴A’ represents logi-
cally valid expressions which have been formed by conditionalizing logically
valid inference forms of the syllogistic. But such expressions do not represent a
logically true proposition. Conformity to these forms is not a sufficient but only a
necessary condition of truth.232
The occurrence of logical truth in FC, like that of logical consequence in FC, pre-
supposes both the validity of syllogistic rules of logical consequence and the validity
of the basic rules (VI. 3) to (VI. 6) postulated in § 72.233 Since each of these postulates
is dispensable for logic and can either be omitted or replaced by another one, alter-
natives to the axiomatic calculus of functions are possible, by which the syntactic,
though not the semantic concept of logical truth is maintained. The semantic concept
is bound to the occurrence of truth functions, which presupposes the validity of
Frege calls the sign ‘⊦’ the “common predicate for all judgments”, because it represents the
expression “is a fact” (1879, 4, § 3 [1967, 13]). It is composed of the (vertical) “judgement stroke” and
the (horizontal) “content stroke” (1879, 2, § 2 [1967, 12]). These names show that Frege, unlike his
successors, did not consider his logic to be a ‘formal logic’ in Kant’s sense. (“I was not trying to
present an abstract logic in formulas; I was trying to express contents in an exacter and more per-
spicuous manner than is possible in words, by using written symbols.” Frege 1882a, 1 [1968, 89].)
Kant, CPR A 59/B 84–85 f. and A 796/B 824.
Logical truth in FC therefore presupposes, by virtue of (VI. 5) and (VI. 6), a non-empty uni-
verse of discourse and depends to that extent on postulates as they are characteristic of mathe-
matics (see § 72, Scholium). Bertrand Russell and others have held the view that truth that
depends on the universe not being empty cannot be logical truth, since it is true, but not logically
true that the universe is not empty. See Russell 1919b, 194–206; Langford 1927, 342–346. This view
was rejected by W.V.O. Quine. In a polemic (Quine 1963, 160–67), he argued: “from the point of
view of utility in application it would be folly [. . .] to want to limit the laws of quantification
theory in this way” (1963, 162), i.e., it would be foolish to limit the laws of the calculus of functions
to those laws which were valid for every universe, including even an empty universe. Instead, it
is recommended (in Quine’s view) to leave out of consideration the case of the empty universe,
which is relatively useless from the perspective of application (1963, 161). Quine has thus admit-
ted that the range of application of the calculus of functions is essentially a non-empty universe
and could have agreed with Russell that logical truth in FC can, with equal right, be called
‘mathematical’.

postulates (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) (see § 71 above) and to which the logical calculus of
functions owes its name. Hence there are axiomatic logical calculi which are
not truth-functional. For example, the theorems of soundness and completeness
established above can be applied without restriction to the intuitionistic axiom-
atic system of propositional calculus established by Arend Heyting (1930, 42–56).
Since in Heyting’s system the simple detachment rule (VI. 8) remains valid, it is
even possible to derive all axioms of his system (like those of the axiomatic cal-
culus of functions) (see § 80) from itself and to regard them as theorems of this
system as well.

Conclusion
§ 82 Principles and Rules on Which the Complete System of the Calculus
of Functions Depends
According to § 78, the complete system of axioms and derived rules of the calculus
of functions depends directly on the rules (VI. 8), (VI. 11), (VI. 17), (VI. 18), (VI. 23),
and (VI. 24). If one considers the proofs which were given above (in § 74 and § 75)
for the validity of these rules, and if one traces the principles which are used ei-
ther directly or indirectly in these proofs, one will find that – disregarding the
weakened or non-weakened versions of the three meta-rules (I. 2), (I. 3), and
(II. 1), as well as the meta-rule (VI. 7) (which are used directly or indirectly for
derivation) – the validity of the complete system of axioms and derived rules of the
calculus of functions depends on eight syllogistic and three non-syllogistic basic
rules in total. The syllogistic basic rules are
(I. 1)
The rule of double negation as a result of an affirmation
(II. 2)
Modus ponendo ponens,
(III. 1)
Dictum de omni,
(III. 3)
The first exposition rule,
(III. 7)
Subalternation in the weak logical square,
(III. 8)
Basic rule of the universal limitative proposition,
(III. 9)
Basic rule of the particular limitative proposition,
(III. 10)
Basic rule of the singular limitative proposition.
For non-syllogistic basic rules, the three postulates of the extended deductive
logic are needed, namely
(VI. 3)
The postulate of the arbitrary sufficient reason
(VI. 4)
The postulate of the affirmative use of double negation
(VI. 5–6)
The postulate of non-empty domains.
I had already taken as an assumption in Part I of this essay that these three postu-
lates are non-syllogistic basic rules – namely, rules whose validity must not be
claimed within the elementary syllogistic. But only now that I have, in Part II, let
the main features of the structure of the syllogistic systematically confront the
main features of the structure of the calculus of functions should it become clear
that the elementary syllogistic can be described as that sphere of deductive logic
in which the validity of the three mentioned postulates does not need to be
assumed.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-012

Since, conversely, syllogistic principles must be assumed as valid within the
sphere of the calculus of functions, the elementary syllogistic has, in comparison
to the calculus of functions, proved to be the more fundamental region of deduc-
tive logic: the calculus utilizes, at least implicitly, syllogistic rules, while the ele-
mentary syllogistic is for its part entirely independent of the rules and laws of the
calculus.
The systematic relationship between the elementary syllogistic and the calcu-
lus of functions can be described somewhat more precisely by considering still
more closely theorem (4) as mentioned in § 80, one of the axioms of the calculus
of functions. According to § 78, the validity of this theorem depends on the singu-
larization rule (VI. 15) being valid, from which the law of singularization (VI. 24)
in § 75 was derived. The proof that is carried out for this law in § 74 only came off
by bringing into play not only expressions with concept variables, but also ex-
pressions with conceptual constants. This proof thus relies (directly or indirectly
by means of the rules (VI. 12) and (VI. 14)) on the substitution of ζ and ξ in expres-
sions of rules which can be formulated in the syllogistic language. In this way, we
can see that theorem (4) is dependent on rules of contentful inference. The case is
just the same for the generalization rules (VI. 10)✶and (VI. 11)✶of the calculus of
functions, whose validity is proven in § 74 with rules (VI. 10) and (VI. 11). There
are thus good reasons not to count the calculus of functions among the formal
part of deductive logic but rather as a special division within the theory of con-
tentful inference. Of course, since it presupposes the standing of more particular,
non-syllogistic principles, it is not to be regarded as a calculus of contentful syllo-
gistic inference, which I have described in Section Five of Part II.
The syllogistic differs from the calculus of functions not only by its rules’
being more fundamental but also by their more formal character. The syllogistic
is, as can now be seen with great exactness, formal logic (in a narrower, more
precise sense of this expression). The equation of formal logic and the logic of the
classical functional or predicate calculus (including its non-classical derivatives),
which is very widespread and almost customary nowadays, clearly rests on a pro-
found lack of insight into the logical presuppositions of this logic. The rules of the
classical calculus of functions or predicates are better seen as rules of informal
deductive inference.
Connected with the syllogistic’s status of being a more fundamental and more
formal part of deductive logic is the fact that syllogistic rules are valid for all de-
ductive inference. For this reason, the syllogistic is to be regarded as general
logic, or more precisely, the general part of deductive logic. The phrase ‘general
part of deductive logic’ has the advantage of not letting the misunderstanding
arise that the syllogistic could contain all rules of deductive inference, rather
than the rules of all deductive inference. In truth, syllogistic rules make up only
Conclusion § 82
307

an extremely small part of the totality of deductive rules – which is already evi-
dent from the fact that the syllogistic does not contain all principles which can be
assumed in deductive inference.
§ 83 Logical Form: A Review of the Results Attained
It is now time to summarize some results of this essay and to highlight more
clearly those which are especially important and interesting from a philosophical
point of view. The most important of them is contained in the response to the
question: What does the logical form of a statement consist in? It cannot be said
that the answer we have discovered delivers an insight that is completely new in
every respect. But precisely the fact that here something well-known appears in a
new light may in the eyes of some readers have something surprising to it, if not
even something altogether provocative.
The answer we have discovered can be summarized as follows:
The logical form of a statement is precisely what is expressed in the syllogistic
propositional schema corresponding to this statement. It is, in other words, pre-
cisely that in a statement which is left over when its conceptual content (i.e., what
concept variables stand for) is left out of consideration. Behind this answer is con-
cealed the old idea that the logical form of a statement is a constellation of state-
ment-properties which do not exceed the dozen that Kant’s table of judgments
enumerates in a symmetrical arrangement and contains “no more than what Aris-
totle and his direct students have regarded as the main logical moments in the the-
ory of judgment and inference” (Reich 2001, 4–5). Of course, the old idea needs to
be made precise in two respects if it is supposed to be correct and tenable, and this
precision is, as it were, the light in which the well-known appears in a new way.
First: the qualitative, relational, and modal statement-properties, insofar as they
contribute to logical form, should not be interpreted truth-functionally or understood
as properties which are interpretable with the aid of a truth-functional explication;
distinct types of truth-functions have something to do with distinctions of logical
form only indirectly, since truth-functional expressions – including expressions of ne-
gation – are structures which, as I have shown above, admit a logical analysis in
which they are equivalent to expressions composed of non-truth-functional expres-
sions. Second: quantitative properties, insofar as they contributed to the logical form
of a statement, should not be confused with various kinds of saturation of proposi-
tional functions. Distinctions of logical form do depend on whether empty places in a
functional expression are filled by individual constants or bound individual varia-
bles. But nevertheless particular conceptual contents, which can be clearly distin-
guished from the logical form, are connected to the use of these signs. As has been
308
Part II Conclusion

shown, these signs admit an analysis in which they are equivalent to phrases that
contain only concept expressions and the logical vocabulary of the syllogistic.
The question of logical form was one of the central questions in twentieth-
century philosophy. Bertrand Russell and the young Ludwig Wittgenstein – who
were even ready to equate the logical form of statements with the subject-matter of
philosophy as such – had seen that the logical form of expressions of the type ‘F (a)’
is not apparent on their surface. At the same time, they were proponents of the view
that giving a logical analysis of linguistic expressions always requires a reduction to
truth- and propositional functions. Such a constellation of positions naturally had
the consequence that the question of logical form had to become a philosophical rid-
dle of the first order. To be sure, this riddle has given some impetus to the analytic
philosophy of language, especially its attempts to ascertain the essence of expres-
sions for which the ‘a’ in ‘F (a)’ stands – the essence of proper names and so-called
singular terms. But the riddle itself has found no satisfactory solution in these at-
tempts. We have seen that even the distinction between singular and general terms
rests on mistaken assumptions and that no clarity is secured for the question of the
essence of proper names so long as the question of the essence of logical form has
found no suitable answer.
An explanation of what a logical consequence is and what logical validity is
also depends on this answer.234 On these two questions, too, the present essay has
achieved an important result: a proposition p follows logically from one or more
propositions if and only if the occurrence of one or more than one logical constants
of the syllogistic makes it impossible that p is false and each of the remaining pro-
positions involved is true. A proposition is logically valid if and only if it is equiva-
lent to a hypothetical proposition that can be generated by conditionalizing a rule
according to which a proposition logically follows from one or more propositions.
Accordingly, tautologies are not just as such logically valid. Thus, a tautologi-
cal proposition of the form ‘every α is an α’ can well be false, and indeed it is
false if α is an empty concept, so that there is no object with which the proposi-
tion (as an affirmative proposition) could correspond. A tautology of the form ‘if
A, then A’ (consisting of identical clauses) does not express a logical truth either.
For it depends on the content of the proposition A whether its truth is incompati-
ble with the truth of N A, so that A follows from A. If one replaces A in both places
with N A, there is no such incompatibility. Thus, a proposition of the form ‘if N A,
then N A’ can be false.
I have shown in § 81 that within the calculus of functions there is a way of using the expres-
sions ‘logically true’ and ‘follows logically’ that clashes with the concepts of logical validity and logi-

Only the logical form (in the sense given to this expression) can decide
whether a proposition is logically valid or logically follows from other proposi-
tions. Theorems of a logical calculus, of which one may be able to say (according
to § 81) that they are ‘logically true’ or ‘logically follow’ from other theorems in
this calculus, presuppose the universal validity of rules and laws whose logical
form can be represented only in the syllogistic.
§ 84 Stages in the History of Logic
If one wants to be an innovator,
then one longs to be the first;
if one wants only truth,
one longs for predecessors.
(Kant, Refl. 2159)
That the old appears in a new light means that what is past must be seen in a
new way. – Kant writes in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason of
1787, that “logic” has
since the time of Aristotle [. . .] not had to go a single step backwards, unless we count the
abolition of a few dispensable subtleties or the more distinct determination of its presenta-
tion, which improvements belong more to the elegance than to the security of that science.
What is further remarkable about logic is that until now it has also been unable to take a
single step forward, and therefore seems to all appearance to be finished and complete. [. . .]
It is not an improvement but a deformation of the sciences when their boundaries are al-
lowed to run over into one another; the boundaries of logic, however, are determined quite
precisely by the fact that logic is the science that exhaustively presents and strictly proves
nothing but the formal rules of all thinking (whether this thinking be empirical or a priori,
whatever origin or object it may have, and whatever contingent or natural obstacles it may
meet with in our minds). / For the advantage that has made it so successful logic has solely
its own limitation to thank, since it is thereby justified in abstracting – is indeed obliged to
abstract – from all objects of cognition and all the distinctions between them; and in logic,
therefore, the understanding has to do with nothing further than itself and its own form.
(CPR B viii–ix)
This passage is gladly quoted in modern books on logic and the history of logic in
order to show, on the one hand, how great and lasting the influence that Aristotle’s
logic had exercised for centuries, and, on the other hand, how biased even great phi-
losophers had been under this influence when it came to assessing the actual value
of Aristotelian logic and its place within the history of logic. As the quotation shows,
Kant does not only not anticipate the possibility of substantial progress beyond Aris-
totle, he was apparently even ready to definitively exclude such a possibility. Accord-
ing to the image promoted by modern handbooks and standard works of the history
310
Part II Conclusion

of logic, Kant would not have had to wait even a hundred years to see his view re-
futed by the facts.
According to this image, the history of logic can be divided into two great main
epochs. The first begins with Aristotle’s (382–322) Analytica priora, the second with
Frege’s (1848–1925) Begriffsschrift published in 1879. The division of traditional and
modern logic is used today such that it corresponds to the division within logic be-
fore and after 1879.
“Logic is an old subject, and since 1879 it has been a great one” (Quine 1959,
vii). – With Frege’s work a dramatic upswing began, which allowed the initially
small sphere of logic, which could be treated between two book covers on a few
pages, to become a branch of science which today can hardly be surveyed even by
experts. A development which was already initiated by scattered predecessors of
Frege has ultimately led to the establishment of modern logic as a many-branched
area of mathematical research. Modern and mathematical logic have basically be-
come synonyms. Modern logic is called mathematical for two reasons: firstly, it has
itself become the object of mathematical investigations; secondly its language is
suited to seamlessly present mathematical proofs. Traditional logic was not actually
in a position to do this.
Now, the fact that the field of logic has since 1879 strongly enlarged itself and
grown into mathematics admits of two different readings.
According to the first reading, the historical process can be read as though in
the course of expanding the region of logic there was at the same time a reconfigu-
ration of its foundations, in which the syllogistic as the standalone region of logic
dissolved and something else took its place. From this perspective, which is today
the reigning opinion of logicians and historians of logic, a revolution within logic
took place in 1879, whereby the Aristotelian syllogistic was “dissolved” “as a para-
digm”.235 After the revolution, the syllogistic could only claim validity for special
cases of deductive inference.236 Incidentally, Frege himself prepared the way for the
revolutionary reading of the events since 1879: he advanced the view in his Be-
griffsschrift that the logical laws which can be derived within that system, would
“take the place of the Aristotelian modes of inference” (Frege 1879, 10, § 6 [1967, 17]).
This view, as has hopefully been shown clearly enough in this book, cannot
be maintained. In any case, not insofar as one can interpret the Aristotelian doc-
trine of inference as a theory which deals in its essentials with the forms of syllo-
gistic argumentation as they have been presented systematically in Section One
This is how, e.g., Wolgang Künne (1996, 325) sees it.
See on this the article “Logic” in Blackburn (1994, 221): “Syllogistic is now generally regarded
as a limited special case of the forms of reasoning that can be represented within the proposi-
tional and predicate calculus. These form the heart of modern logic.”
Conclusion § 84
311

of Part I and in the first four Sections of Part II of this essay. These forms have
been definitively established as basic forms of deductive inference.
It thus stands to reason that the revolutionary reading of modern logic should
be given up and replaced by a description that does not comport with its self-image.
According to this rival description, it was merely an expansion of the region
of deductive logic which occurred with the emergence and branching-out of
mathematical logic, without in the process compromising the autonomy of its
core region, namely, the independence of the syllogistic. Considered in this way,
new non-syllogistic sub-spheres of logic, which did not exist or only rudimentarily
prior to 1879, have been added on to the core sphere of logic, which coincides in
its essentials with the traditional syllogistic tracing back to Aristotle.
This description comports with a perspective which in its basics is completely
compatible with the assessment that Kant made of the history of logic since Aris-
totle in the passage quoted above. It comports with this perspective especially in-
sofar as Kant was also ready to regard the syllogistic, which he called “formal
logic,” as only a part, namely, as the general (pure) part of deductive logic, and to
distinguish from it other, more specific parts which he called logics of the “special
use of the understanding”, among which he counted mathematical logic (which
was in his lifetime admittedly still stuck in its very first beginnings).237 As the last
sentence of the passage quoted at the beginning of this § indirectly shows, Kant
refers there only to a part of logic which has to do with the general use of the
understanding (cf. CPR A 52, B 76).
How could it nevertheless come about that Frege’s innovations have been re-
ceived by experts almost unanimously as if they were a revolution within deductive
logic and not its mere expansion with a specific sphere (however large and extraor-
dinarily important for mathematics it may be) of the theory of contentful deductive
inference?
This question will not be able to be satisfactorily answered without accounting
for the fact that the enduring lack of insight into the systematics of deductive logic
is not due only to the self-image of modern logic as shaped by Frege, but also to the
lack of an exact logical analysis of past systems of the syllogistic systems, which
because of their predominantly verbal form have made it less clear than modern
logical systems that they make up no more than one part of deductive logic. For
this a more exact semantic comparison of the differences in the logical vocabulary
of syllogistic and modern systems was needed. Lacking such an analysis, it could
always look as if traditional syllogistic systems were merely imperfect precursors
to what is commonly called modern logic.

Part II Conclusion

If it was Kant’s view that already Aristotle had brought the syllogistic to a sci-
entific level in such a way that a “more distinct determination of its presentation”
was either ruled out or could only still lead to such “improvements” as “belong
more to the elegance than to the security of that science” (see the first sentence of
the passage quoted at the beginning of this §), then he was obviously not right in
this opinion. It suffices to recall questions about the validity of the rules of the logi-
cal square or the modal syllogistic – which began first to take off in the 19th and
20th centuries in their full acuity – to see that the ‘security of science’ with respect
to the traditional syllogistic was no lesser a desideratum than ‘elegance’. But it
could have achieved security only on the basis of a suitably comprehensive system
of sufficiently precise and elaborate definitions which fix the meaning of expres-
sions in its logical vocabulary, and this in sharp delimitation to the meaning of ex-
pressions of the calculus of functions. Neither Aristotle nor Kant were in a position
to carry out such a delimitation, simply because there was no calculus of functions
in their time. Neither Aristotle nor Kant could have left behind a comprehensive
system of explicit definitions that fix the meaning of logical constants sufficiently
precisely and elaborately, which why only starting attempts at such definitions can
be found in their work. The need to establish an appropriate system of definitions –
and thus to make a start at a modernized syllogistic – could naturally only appear
after a logical calculus of functions was fully formed.

Appendix 1
On the Completeness of a Syllogistic without Logical
Conjunction
(To § 40)
The elementary conjunction represented by ‘(. . ., . . .)’ – also called a conjunction
of premises above – does not belong to the logical vocabulary which is needed to
present the elementary syllogistic in Parts I and II of this essay. In what follows, I
will call the language which contains only this logical vocabulary and which I
have called the ‘elementary language of the syllogistic’ at the end of § 15, ‘lan-
guage 1’. I will distinguish from this language a ‘language 2’ whose vocabulary
contains not only the logical vocabulary of language 1 but in addition the logical
constant ‘(. . ., . . .)’. Finally, we can think of a third language which relates to lan-
guage 2 just like language 1 relates to language 2, because it differs from the latter
just by the fact that the logical constant ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ does not occur in it. I call this
language ‘language 3’.
We should compare languages 1 and 3 with respect to their capability. For
this one needs the superordinate language 2. For only in this language can rules
be formulated so that expressions of language 1 can be put into a logical relation
with expressions of language 3 and compared with each other. The expressions
that matter for the desired comparison are of course expressions of the basic
rules which can only be rendered in the languages we are comparing. Concerning
language 1, the basic rules which belong to it are first of all those I introduced
above in §§ 44 and 48. As for the capability of language 1, we must ask whether
there are for the hypothetical expressions which occur in the basic rules of hypo-
thetical inference expressions of language 3 of the same logical strength; and con-
versely: whether there is for every expression of language 3 an expression of the
same logical strength in language 1. By expressions of the same logical strength I
mean just those expressions for which there are rules in language 2 according to
which the one expression is derivable from the other, and conversely. We can say
that the capabilities of languages 1 and 3 are equally great (in a certain respect) if
there is for every expression in one language an expression in the other with the
same logical strength.
The question which must now be posed is: what are the valid rules which put
expressions of languages 1 and 3 in a logical relation that can be formulated in lan-
guage 2? To be able to answer this question, we must go back to the definitions
from which result each of the basic rules that hold for the expressions of the lan-
guages we are comparing. These are the definitions of the hypothetical proposition
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-013

and of the conjunction of premises. According to the definition in § 47, a hypotheti-
cal proposition of the form H (A, B) is true if and only if B follows regularly from A;
and according to the definition of regular consequence in § 43, B follows regularly
from A if and only if A and C, with C = N B and B = N C, are incompatible. Now the
incompatibility of two propositions A and C can be immediately defined as a rela-
tion which obtains if and only if NM (A, C) is true (see Appendix 4 below). From this
it results that besides the basic rules of § 48, both of the following rules hold as well
and can be formulated in language 2:
H (A, B) : : NM (A, N B),
(2. 1)
H (A, N B) : : NM (A, B).
(2. 2)
By contrast, no rule which could be rendered in language 2 and in which a logical
relation to the form of hypothetical propositions would be expressed, could be
based directly on the definition of the conjunction of premises which I established
in § 30. For according to this definition, the meaning of a conjunction of premises
‘(. . ., . . .)’
is fixed such that for every interpretation in which A and B are true or false prop-
ositions, it holds that:
(1) (A, B) is true if A and B are both true or N (A, B) is false; and (2) (A, B) is false if it is
possible that A or B is false and thus that N A or N B is true.
From this definition, no logical relation to the form of hypothetical propositions
directly results. Rather, only the following three basic rules (belonging to lan-
guage 3) can be directly based on this definition:
A, B ∴(A, B),
(3. 1)
B, A ∴(A, B),
(3. 2)
NN (A, B) ∴(A, B).
(3. 3)
Now, it can be shown on the basis of the rules (2. 1), (2. 2), and (3. 1) that for cer-
tain expressions of the form H (A, B), there is a certain expression of the same
logical strength in language 3, and conversely for a certain expression of the form
(A, B) there is a certain expression of the same logical strength in language 1 as
well. That is, two further rules hold in language 2:
H (A, B) : : N (A, C) (with C = N B or B = N C),
(2. 3)
(A, B) : : NH (A, C) (with C = N B or B = N C).
(2. 4)

To prove the validity of both these rules, one must provide separate proofs for
the sub-rules they contain. Here, first, are the proofs for the four sub-rules which
are summarized by (2. 3):

These eight proofs show, first, that every negated and non-negated expression of the
form H (A, B) from language 1 (with arbitrary substitutions for A and B) is replace-
able by an equivalent expression from language 3, and, second, that conversely
every negated and non-negated expression of the form (A, B) from language 3 (with
arbitrary substitutions for A and B) is replaceable by an equivalent expression from
language 1 as well. Because of the equivalence of these expressions, one may also
assume with Alexander of Aphrodisias that they can be translated into one another
without loss of meaning, so that, e.g., ‘H (A, B)’ and ‘N (A, N B)’ are equivalent to ‘A is
incompatible with N B’.238
However, this cannot mean that languages 1 and 3 are entirely substitutable
for each other. The logical vocabulary that is needed for a given logical system,
such as the syllogistic, depends decisively on the language which is used for the
establishment of its basic rules. Such rules include not only inference forms from
which other inference forms are to be derived and which themselves do not need

Appendix 1

any derivation, since they (like, e.g., modus ponendo ponens) are valid on the
basis of the meaning of the logical vocabulary which is used in them. The basic
rules also include the metalogical rules according to which forms of inference are
derived from other forms of inference.
It can be seen from the proofs of the validity of the eight rules (2. 3. 1) to (2. 4. 4)
in language 2 that there is no metalogical rule from language 3 which would be ap-
plied here, but there is one from language 1, namely the principle of conditionaliza-
tion (II. 1). As one can see, the proofs for the validity of (2. 3. 2) and (2. 3. 4) depend
on this principle, and those for (2. 4. 2) and (2. 4. 4) depend on it indirectly. This
principle is needed here to transform the form of an inference from two premises
into a form in which one of the two premises becomes the antecedent of a hypo-
thetical conclusion. This principle is generally valid because the regular consequence
of a conclusion B from one of several premises, A, means the same as H (A, B)
(see § 48). Since all logical consequence is regular consequence, this principle can
be used in general to derive modes of inference from other modes of inference.
However, unlike ‘H (. . ., . . .)’, the expression ‘(. . ., . . .)’ is incapable of ren-
dering the existence of a consequence relation which must occur in every form of
inference from which another form of inference is derived. For this reason, lan-
guage 3 contains no expression with which the metalogical rule for deriving infer-
ence forms from other inference forms can be established. And from this it
results that, concerning the logical vocabulary for the basic rules of the elemen-
tary syllogistic, language 1 can be replaced only partially, but not completely by
language 3. Yet in the opposite direction a complete substitution is possible, as is
demonstrated by the use of language 2 described in this Appendix.

Appendix 2
Mathematical Induction without Higher-Level
Predicate Logic
(To § 28 and § 37)
The principle of complete induction can be presented as the following proposi-
tional schema:
(A (0) ⊃((∀n) (A (n) ⊃A (n + 1)) ⊃(∀n) A (n))), for n ∈ℕ.
With this is assumed that A is one of the logical function expressions F1 (x), . . ., Fm (x),
with m > 1, and that each of these expressions is an abbreviation for some concrete
open proposition, for example for a proposition like ‘x + x = 2x’, among others. The
above proposition schema is thus equivalent to the proposition schema
(Fi (0) ⊃((∀n) (Fi (n) ⊃Fi (n + 1)) ⊃(∀n) Fi (n))), for n ∈ℕ,
with n ≧i ≧1. In a more logically precise way, we could also write instead:
[n ∈ℕ] ⊃(Fi (0) ⊃((∀n) (Fi (n) ⊃Fi (n+1)) ⊃(∀n) Fi (n))).
Frege carried out a proof for the validity of the principle of mathematical induc-
tion in his Begriffsschrift, in which he made use of the second-level calculus of
functions. In the following, it will be shown how this can be avoided.
Frege’s proof relies on three definitions. The first definition (see Frege 1879,
55, § 24, def. 69 [1967, 55]) is supposed to establish what it means that one property
is heritable in a certain series of bearers of that property. The definiendum of this
definition is
the property F is hereditary in the f-series,
and the relevant definiens is clothed in a formula in the concept-script which cor-
responds to the following expression:
(∀y) (F (y) ⊃(∀x) (f (y, x) ⊃F (x))).
Roughly, the sub-expressions ‘F (x)’ and ‘F (y)’ in this formula mean the same as
‘Fi (x)’ and ‘Fi (y)’. That is, these sub-expressions are not abbreviations for certain
concrete open propositions, but rather schematic expressions which play the role
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-014

of a substitute for an arbitrary abbreviation of that type. Accordingly, the talk of
a “property F” serves Frege as generic designation for all those properties which
one would ascribe to an object a, if one replaced Fi (x) with one of the open pro-
positions F1 (x), . . ., Fn (x) and in each of these propositions replaced x with a.
Hence, what Frege calls “property F” is, expressed in my preferred formula lan-
guage, the same as the property (′x) Fi (x).239 In this way, Frege’s first definition is
designed to make the expression
the property (′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the f-series
replaceable by the formula
(∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃(∀x) (f (y, x) ⊃Fi (x))).
The second definition on which Frege’s proof relies (see Frege 1879, 60–62, § 26,
def. 76 [1967, 59]) has the task of explaning what it means for an object y to follow
an object x in the f-series. In other words, the definiendum is here:
y follows x in the f-series.
Frege recommends as definiens an expression which is formulated in the lan-
guage of the second-level calculus of functions. This expression corresponds to
the following formula:
(∀Φ) ([Φ is hereditary in the f-series] ⊃((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Φ (x)) ⊃Φ (y))).
In words, this formula could be rendered in this way: ‘For every property Φ, Φ is
not hereditary in the f-series unless ((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Φ (x)) ⊃Φ (y))’.
What is meant here by ‘property Φ’, in contrast to what Frege calls ‘property
F’? Essentially, properties Φ can mean nothing else than properties which can be
enumerated in the series (′x) Fi (x), . . ., (′x) Fm (x), with m > 1, thus properties
which are summarized with the expression ‘(′x) Fi (x), with m ≧i ≧1’. For pre-
cisely these are the properties which, according to what was said above, can be
considered heritable. The expression ‘(′x) Fi (x), with m ≧i ≧1’ can refer to any of
these properties. However, because Frege avails himself of no index-notation but just
his concept-script, he finds himself having to introduce the universally quantified
function variable Φ240 to be able to refer to all properties (′x) Fi (x), with m ≧i ≧1, in
the series (′x) Fi (x), . . ., (′x) Fm (x), with m > 1. The transition to an expression of the
so-called higher-level calculus of functions, i.e., the replacement of ‘F (x)’ and ‘F (y)’
with universally quantified function variables ‘Φ (x)’ and ‘Φ (y)’ in the definiens

Instead of ‘Φ’, Frege uses an upper-case Fraktur letter.
322
Appendix 2

of the definition of ‘y follows x in the f-series’ is explained by Frege’s aspiration to
attain a sound definition of the latter expression. If the definiens of this definition
consisted in the formula
[F is hereditary in the f-series] ⊃((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃F (x)) ⊃F (y)),
then the letter F in this formula could only be either a constant or a substitute for
constants, i.e., a variable or a schematic letter. In the first case, the content of this
formula would be too specific to be equivalent to the definiendum. For in this case,
only just one of the many properties (′x) Fi (x), . . ., (′x) Fm (x) would be understood
as heritable with ‘F’. In the other case, the definition would be unsound for a differ-
ent reason. For the definiens of a sound definition can only contain a free variable
if it occurs free in the corresponding definiendum. Otherwise, the defining expres-
sion would not be equivalent to the defined expression. Hence, ‘F (x)’ and ‘F (y)’ in
the formula of the definiens need to be replaced by expressions which are neither
too specific nor involve an inadmissible multiplication of free variables. Inciden-
tally, a formula like
[(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the f-series] ⊃((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Fi (x)) ⊃Fi (y))
does not deliver a sound definition either. With ‘i’, the definiens would contain a
free variable which did not also occur free in the corresponding definiendum. But
‘Fi’ is not a constant; it rather plays the role of a sign which only becomes a con-
stant if one puts a definite numeral in place of the index letter i. As for Frege’s
solution to the problem, it consists in replacing ‘F (x)’ and ‘F (y)’ with ‘Φ (x)’ and
‘Φ (y)’, respectively, and connecting with them a universal quantifier, the prefix
‘(∀Φ) . . .’. This quantifier makes it so that x and y in the definiens and definien-
dum of the definition are the only free variables.
For reasons which I described in § 28 above, however, one should see this
solution only as a stopgap. The view at the basis of this solution – that one may
regard open propositions of the form F (x) as expressions for properties, so that
these expressions may be represented by variables over which one may quantify,
even though they are only unsaturated expressions of the form Φ (x) (and thus
meaningless on their own) – is untenable. It thus remains the case that the prop-
erties which are treated as heritable properties in Frege’s definition cannot be
adequately designated with signs like ‘F’, ‘Φ’, ‘property F’, or ‘property Φ’, though
they can be enumerated in sequence with ‘(′x) Fi (x), . . ., (′x) Fm (x), with m > 1’
and can be designated by the expression ‘(′x) Fi (x), with m ≧i ≧1’.
‘Fi’ plays the role of a schematic expression only so long as i is something like a
free variable. However, one can bind i by explicitly stipulating as a condition that

(∀i) (i ≧1). We then obtain a suitable definition for ‘y follows x in the f-series’ by
replacing the formula last considered with an expression which contains an ex-
plicit stipulation of that sort, namely by writing:
(∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃([(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the f-series] ⊃((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Fi (x)) ⊃Fi (y))).
Frege would not have been able to admit such a definition into the framework of
his logicistic program, which was designed to reduce the language of arithmetic
to a language of the concept-script. For ‘i ≧1’ is clearly not an expression from
the concept-script, but from arithmetic. To avoid having to demolish the frame-
work of the formula language of the concept-script, Frege had to condone treating
function variables by analogy with individual variables, as if function variables
did not carry with them empty places for constants and as if it would thus be pos-
sible to bind such variables with a quantifier without difficulty.
Let us see what results for the proof of the validity of the principle of mathe-
matical induction if we abstain from bringing a second-level calculus of functions
into a play. The proof can be based on the formula which I last proposed as an
alternative to the expression which, according to Frege’s second definition, is sup-
posed to take the place of ‘y follows x in the f-series’. The formula is:
(∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃([(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the f-series] ⊃((∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Fi (x)) ⊃Fi (y))).
To simplify241 the presentation of the proof a bit, I will use the one-place func-
tional expression ‘φ (y)’ in place of the two-place functional expression ‘f (y, x)’. In
this way, I simplify the expression for the definiens of the first definition by re-
placing ‘(∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃(∀x) (f (y, x) ⊃Fi (x)))’ with ‘(∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃(∀x) (φ (y) ⊃Fi
(x)))’. We can further simplify this expression by replacing its sub-formula ‘(x) (φ
(y) ⊃Fi (x))’ with ‘Fi (φ (y))’. The definiens of the first definition, i.e., the expression
which can take the place of ‘the property (′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the f-series’,
then has the short form:
(∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃Fi (φ (y))).
With the same kind of simplification, we can obtain a short form of the definiens
of the second definition, i.e., the expression which can take the place of ‘y follows
x in the f-series’: I replace the sub-formula ‘(∀x) (f (w, x) ⊃Fi (x))’ which occurs

there with an abbreviated expression ‘Fi (φ (x))’. After applying the importation
rule, the definiens of the second definition then has the simplified form:
((∀i) (i ≧1) & [(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the φ-series] & Fi (φ (x))) ⊃Fi (y).
Accordingly, it follows from the second definition that:
(1) [y follows x in the φ-series] ⊃
((∀i) (i ≧1) & [(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the φ -series] & Fi (φ (x))) ⊃Fi (y).
By exportation and antecedent exchange, a formula resuls from (1) that corre-
sponds to Frege’s theorem 78 (Frege 1879, 63, § 27 [1967, 61]):
(2) [(′x) F (x) is hereditary in the φ -series]
⊃(Fi (φ (x) ⊃([y follows x in the φ -series] ⊃((∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃Fi (y))))).
From the first definition, by substituting y for x, one attains in an analogous way:
(3) [(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the φ-series] ⊃(Fi (x) ⊃Fi (φ (x))).
According to Frege’s second axiom, the law of propositional logic ‘(p ⊃(q ⊃r)) ⊃
((p ⊃q) ⊃(p ⊃r))’, a formula results from (2) which corresponds to Frege’s theo-
rem 79 (Frege 1879, 63 [1967, 61]):
(4) ([(′x) F (x) is hereditary in the φ -series] ⊃F (φ (x))) ⊃([(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the
φ -series] ⊃([y follows x in the φ -series] ⊃((∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃Fi (y)))).
After an antecedent exchange in (3), a formula corresponding to Frege’s theorem
81 follows from (3) and (4), by an inference according to the rule of detachment
(Frege 1879, 63 [1967, 61]):
(5) Fi (x) ⊃([(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the φ -series] ⊃([y follows x in the φ -series] ⊃((∀i)
(i ≧1) ⊃Fi (y)))).
(5) is thus a formula that depends on both definitions.
As Frege (1879, 64 [1967, 62]) remarks, Bernoullian induction “rests” upon the-
orem 81.242 The transition to the proof-principle for mathematical induction can
be made in a corresponding way, starting from formula (5). By generalization
over x and with a subsequent instantiation of the numeral 0, we get from (5):
(6) Fi (0) ⊃([(′x) Fi (x) is hereditary in the φ -series] ⊃([y follows 0 in the φ -series] ⊃((∀i)
(i ≧1) ⊃Fi (y)))).

tionum etc.’ (1686). Reprinted in Bernoulli 1744, Vol. 1, 282–83.
Mathematical Induction without Higher-Level Predicate Logic
325

To the sub-expression ‘[y follows 0 in the φ -series]’, the expression ‘∨y = 0ʹ can
be appended, since the first sub-expression ‘Fi (0)’ says that Fi (y) holds if y = 0.
Moreover, (6) can be generalized over y, in which case a two-fold posterior gener-
alization is admissible, since the variable y does not occur free either in ‘Fi (0)’ or
in ‘[(′x) Fi (x) is inherited in the ϕ-series]’. Hence, after replacing ‘(′x) Fi (x) is in-
herited in the ϕ-series’ with the expression that defines it, we get from (6):
(7) Fi (0) ⊃((∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃Fi (φ (y))) ⊃(∀y) (([y follows 0 in the φ -series] ∨y = 0) ⊃((∀i)
(i ≧1) ⊃Fi (y)))).
After an antecedent exchange, the following results:
(8) (∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃((∀y) ([y follows 0 in the φ -series] ∨y = 0) ⊃(Fi (0) ⊃((∀y) (Fi (y) ⊃Fi
(φ (y))) ⊃(∀y) Fi (y)))).
Now, I define with Frege (1986/1950, § 83) the concept of a natural number:243 if n
belongs to the S-series, beginning with zero, or equals zero, then I say ‘n is a natu-
ral number’. Thus, ‘(′x) S (x)’ stands for successorhood, so that S (n) = n + 1. The
same in partially symbolic notation:
([n follows 0 in the S-series] ∨y = 0)244 =def. [n is a natural number].
Now, from (8) we get, after an instantiation of S and n:
(9) (∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃((∀n) ([n follows 0 in the S-series] ∨n = 0) ⊃(FI (0) ⊃((∀n) (Fi (n) ⊃Fi
(n + 1)) ⊃(∀n) Fi (n)))).
The sub-expression ‘[n follows 0 in the S-series] ∨n = 0’ is equivalent to ‘n ∈ℕ’.
For this reason, formula (9) corresponds to the principle of mathematical induc-
tion, which can now be formulated as follows:
(∀i) (i ≧1) ⊃([n ∈ℕ] ⊃(Fi (0) ⊃((∀n) (Fi (n) ⊃Fi (n + 1)) ⊃(∀n) Fi (n))));
Natural numbers are called ‘finite numbers’ in Frege.
The expression in round brackets here corresponds to the definiens in concept-script which
Frege introduces with formula 99 in § 29 of the Begriffsschrift for ‘y belongs to the f-series begin-
ning with x’. – On Frege’s path to derive the induction principle, see also §§45–46 of Basic Laws
of Arithmetic, Vol. 1 (Frege 1893/2013). These paragraphs show, just like §§ 79–83 of Foundations
of Arithmetic (Frege 1986/1950), that for his proof Frege makes use of the definition of belonging
to a φ -series beginning with x, which was introduced by formula 99 in § 29 of the Begriffsschrift.

or somewhat more informally expressed:
Fi (0) ⊃((∀n) (Fi (n) ⊃Fi (n + 1)) ⊃(∀n) Fi (n)), with i ≧1 and n ∈ℕ.
Closing remark: Frege was barred from the path to explaining the validity of the
principle of mathematical induction recommended here. In order to avoid using
numerals, he was dependent on the step (carried out in § 26 of the Begriffsschrift)
into a higher-level predicate logic, which was defective according to his own se-
mantic standards. But using numerals was contrary to the logicist program,
which was supposed to be carried out in the Foundations of Arithmetic (which in
its § 79 repeats the step into higher predicate logic from the Begriffsschrift § 26);
thus, such use was ruled out from the start. It was thus ultimately a ‘philosophi-
cal’ motive (namely, that of logicism and the connected aim of demonstrating
against Kant the analytic character of arithmetic) which inspired Frege’s attempt
to initiate a higher-level predicate logic. And it was this attempt that provided the
basis for Russell’s paradox (see § 28 above).

Reduction of Truth-Functional Expressions
to Non-Truth-Functional Expressions
(To § 30)
In § 30 I showed that all truth functions can be presented with three operators,
namely ‘(. . ., . . .)’, ‘N . . .’, and ‘H (. . ., . . .)’. Even two operators, ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ and
‘N . . .’ suffice to present all truth functions. For expressions of the same logical
strength can replace each other, and both the pair of formulas H (A, B) and N (A, C)
as well as the pair of formulas NH (A, B) and (A, C), with C = N B or B = N C, are
pairs of expressions of the same logical strength (see Appendix 1). In the following I
will limit myself to showing how to present all dyadic truth functions with ‘(. . ., . . .)’,
‘N . . .’, and ‘H (. . ., . . .)’.
For combinatorial reasons, exactly 16 different distributions of truth func-
tions are possible with dyadic truth functions. They correspond to sixteen differ-
ent propositional connections which can be presented exclusively with ‘~ . . .’ and
‘. . . & . . .’:

Each formula in the right column of this table can be transformed into an
equivalent non-truth-functional expression. For if A, B, and C are formulas which
stand within the scope of ‘~ . . .’ and ‘. . . & . . .’, and if we (as per § 30) replace in
Table 4 every formula A & B with the conjunctive formula ((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H
((A, B), B))) and every formula ~ C with the conjunctive formula (N C, H (NN C, C)),
then there results for every row of the table a formula which is equivalent with
the original formula of that row. Table 4 contains, so to speak, only abbreviations
of non-truth-functional expressions.
To explain and justify this claim I would like to compare the meaning of the
expressions (i) ‘A & B’ and (ii) ‘~ C’ with the meaning of the corresponding non-
truth-functional expressions, i.e., with ‘((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B)))’ and
with ‘(N C, H (NN C, C))’, respectively.
(i) Concerning first the meaning of the truth-functional ‘. . . & . . .’, it results from
the truth table for ‘A & B’ (see § 30 and line (12) of Table 4). The same meaning
belongs to the expression ‘((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B)’ as well. That is, this
expression is also true for every interpretation in which both A and B are true or
false propositions if and only if both A and B are true, and false if and only if A or
B is false. To see this, it is enough to note that the pair of formulas ‘(H ((A, B), A)’
and ‘H ((A, B), B))’ presupposes the validity of the postulate of arbitrary sufficient
reason from § 72. This postulate stipulates that according to the rule (VI. 3),
A, B ≺A,
the conclusion A is impossibly false if the premises A and B are both true. Since
the order of the premises A and B is irrelevant for the validity of this rule, it
equally expresses that it is impossible that B is false if A and B are both true. Ac-
cording to § 30, however, the meaning of elementary conjunctions of the form
(A, B) is determined in such a way that they are true only if it is not possible that
A or B is false. According to this determination, assertoric inferences cannot have
a premise which is assumed to be possibly false. The postulate of § 72, on the
other hand, requires that we abandon this determination and assume instead
that for each premise of assertoric inferences, if it is assumed to be true, it is im-
possibly false (so that not universally valid propositions of the form H (A, H (B, A))
and H (A, H (B, B)) are valid, no matter what proposition B stands for). The formula
‘((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B))’ thus expresses that what according to postulate
(VI. 3) should be true for two premises A and B should also be true not only for a
premise A & B, but also for an elementary conjunction of the form (A, B), namely,
that if it is assumed to be true (e.g., as a true premise of an assertoric inference),
then each of its conjunctive members impossibly has the value F. This shows that
330
Appendix 3

expressions of the form ((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B)) are equivalent to expres-
sions of the form A & B.
(ii) What I have shown for ‘. . . & . . .’ can now be shown in a quite similar way for
‘~ . . .’. The meaning of ‘~ C’ results from the truth table for ~ C (see § 30). The same
meaning belongs to the expression ‘(N C, H (NN C, C))’ as well. That is, this expression
is true for any interpretation in which C is a true or false proposition if and only if C
is false, and false if and only if C is true. To see this, it is enough to note that a propo-
sition of the form H (NN C, C) presupposes the validity of the postulate of the affirma-
tive use of double negation from § 72. This postulate stipulates with rule (VI. 4),
NN C ≺C,
that we assume that if the negation of N C is true, then C cannot be false. Rule
(VI. 4) is not universally valid (according to the meaning established in § 43),
since there are cases in which N C is compatible with NN C. However, the validity
of the syllogistic rule (I. 1),
C ∴NN C,
according to which if C is true, the negation of N C cannot be false, rests on logical
grounds and must therefore be assumed. The postulate from § 72 presupposes the
validity of this rule, but rule (VI. 4) requires in addition rejecting the definitional
determination of the meaning of ‘N C’ according to § 43, so that the truth value of
propositions of the form N C is determined by the value of C alone, and N C is false
if and only if C is true. If we now assume for conjunctions of the form (. . ., . . .)
that expressions of the form ((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B))) mean the same as
expressions of the form A & B, as has just been shown, then we can finally show
that conjunctive expressions of the form (N C, H (NN C, C)) are equivalent to truth-
functional expressions of the form N C & NN C, C and therefore equivalent to
truth-functional expressions of the form ~ C.
Conclusion: Both the pair of formulas ‘A & B’ and ‘((A, B), (H ((A, B), A), H ((A, B), B)))’
as well as the pair of formulas ‘~ C’ and ‘(N C, H (NN C, C)’ consist of equivalent ex-
pressions. QED.
It can be shown in a similar way that there is for each of the remaining for-
mulas of the right column of Table 4 an equivalent non-truth-functional expres-
sion in which no logical constants occur besides ‘(. . ., . . .)’, ‘N . . .’, and ‘H . . .’.

Appendix 4
Compatibility and Incompatibility
(To § 30)
We speak of the compatibility of two propositions or two states of affairs when it is
possible that they are both true or both obtain. In the common (everyday) under-
standing, two logically compatible propositions can both be false, indeed even nec-
essarily false. For example, one will not necessarily have to regard it as a logical
error if someone believes the two propositions ‘Triangles have four angles’ and
‘The sum of 2 and 1 is 4’ are indeed both false or even necessarily false, yet still
compatible with each other. One can mention in favor of accepting the compatibil-
ity of both propositions that the proposition ‘If the sum of 2 and 1 is 4, then trian-
gles have four angles’ is not (or at least not in all circumstances) false. On the
contrary, it represents one state of affairs (that does not obtain) following from an-
other (which likewise does not obtain). That both states of affairs do not obtain on
their own, does not preclude that taken together, and perhaps even only taken to-
gether, they could obtain after all and in this sense are compatible with each other.
On the contrary, the statement that the one state of affairs follows from the other
says precisely that the obtaining of the one state of affairs is incompatible with the
non-obtaining of the other. For a proposition of the form, ‘if p, then q’ says the
same thing as the proposition ‘it is impossible that p and not q’ (see § 30 above).
Corresponding to the broad sense of logical compatibility just discussed, there
is a relatively strict concept of logical incompatibility. For the same reason that one
typically does not suppose that every arbitrary declarative proposition follows from
a false declarative proposition (ex falso quodlibet), or that every true declarative
proposition follows from every arbitrary true proposition (verum ex quolibet), one
does not typically suppose that a proposition which is already taken to be false or
necessarily false or contradictory is incompatible with arbitrary other propositions.
One does not typically suppose, for example, that an empirically false proposition
like ‘On the 30th of March, 2009, it snowed in Bielefeld’ is incompatible with arbi-
trary propositions, so that the negation of arbitrary propositions follows from it.
Yet in modern modal logic the concepts of compatibility and incompatibility
often tend to be dealt with differently. To be sure, compatibility and incompatibility
are customarily defined by assuming that both the expressions ‘p is compatible with
q’ and ‘it is possible that p and q’ and that both the expressions ‘p is incompatible
with q’ and ‘it is not possible that p and q’ are equivalent (where this assumption still
completely corresponds to the common understanding). But primarily (outside of
paraconsistent, e.g., relevant-logical, systems) the propositional conjunction occurring
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-016

in these expressions, ‘. . . and . . .’, is read either as a truth-functional conjunction or
it is supposed (as an axiom or on the basis of an axiom) that for expressions of the
type ‘p and q’ a rule holds which corresponds to the simplification rule
p, q
p
(the same as rule (VI. 3) in § 72), which says that p follows from p & q.245 With this
rule it is at the same time supposed (by the contraposition rule) that ~ q follows
from a contradictory propositional conjunction p & ~ p, where q can be an arbitrary
true or false proposition, thus also a proposition ~ r. If one supposes in addition that
r follows from ~ ~ r, that means one supposes that any arbitrary proposition follows
from a contradictory propositional conjunction.246 The relation of one proposition
following from other propositions is often understood in modal logic as the relation
of strict implication. In this conception, ~ q follows from p & ~ p if and only if it is
not possible that (p & ~ p) & ~ ~ q is true, if thus (p & ~ p) is incompatible with ~ ~ q.
If one accepts the simplification rule, then it is immediately supposed along with
this conception that arbitrary double negated propositions are incompatible with a
contradictory propositional conjunction. If one accepts in addition that (according
to rule (VI. 4) (see § 72)) from a double negated proposition the same non-negated
proposition follows, then one ultimately supposes that every arbitrary proposition
follows from a contradictory propositional conjunction.
The basic assumption behind this supposition is snuck into the understanding
of the connective ‘. . . and . . .’ as an expression whose meaning makes accepting
the simplification rule unavoidable. This assumption can be given up only if one
recognizes that this meaning of ‘. . . and . . .’ is not the only one possible, since it
also admits a reading which corresponds to the definition set up above in § 30 (as
well as in Appendix 1) of the conjunction of premises, according to which the simpli-
fication rule does not need to be assumed as a universally valid rule. If one assumes
this definition and, to avoid misunderstandings, uses the logical constant ‘(. . ., . . .)’
for the connective it defines, then the concepts of logical compatibility and incom-
patibility can be fixed by a definition that corresponds to the common everyday un-
derstanding. This definition says:
In intuitionistic logic, the axiom A ⊃(B ⊃A) corresponds to this supposition. See Heyting
1930, 191.
To be sure, in intuitionistic logic it is not supposed that A follows from ~ ~ A, but is assumed
as an axiom that ~ A ⊃(A ⊃B). See Heyting 1930, 191. This axiom expresses the same thing as the
supposition ex falso sequitur quodlibet.
334
Appendix 4

Two propositions p and q are compatible if and only if it is possible that (p, q) is
true; p and q are incompatible if and only if it is not possible that (p, q) is true.247
It accords with this definition – since the simplification rule for the conjunc-
tion of premises does not hold, so that p does not follow from (p, q) (see § 30) –
that no universally valid rule exists according to which it would be admissible
(say, on the basis of (IV. 29)) to derive M p from M (p, q) or NM (p, q) from NM
p.248 In other words: on this conception, the possible truth of a proposition is not
a necessary condition for its being incompatible with another proposition; and it
is likewise not at all sufficient for its incompatibility with other propositions that
a proposition is impossibly true taken on its own. Rather, one should say accord-
ing to this conception that e.g., the two propositions ‘Triangles have four corners’
and ‘The sum of 2 and 1 is 4’ are completely compatible, without then also having
to suppose that it is possible that one of the two propositions is true taken on its
own. Likewise, it is not false to say that the hypothetical proposition ‘If triangles
have four corners, then the sum of 2 and 1 is 4’ is true and accordingly the propo-
sitions ‘Triangles have four corners’ and ‘The sum of 2 and 1 is not 4’ are incom-
patible, without having to suppose for that reason that the impossibility of the
proposition ‘Triangles have four corners’ being true is already a sufficient condi-
tion for this incompatibility.
Due to the restriction of the concept of compatibility that we have carried out
by means of the concept of the conjunction of premises, the relation of regular
consequence can be explained by means of the relation of incompatibility, with-
out needing to involve the unwelcome supposition that every arbitrary declara-
tive proposition follows from a declarative proposition which is impossibly true,
or that an impossibly false proposition follows from every arbitrary declarative
proposition.
Since H (p, N q) is equivalent to NM (p, q) and NH (p, N q) is equivalent to M (p, q), one could
define the compatibility and incompatibility of propositions just as well using hypothetical prop-
ositions. From the fact that H (p, N q) is also equivalent to N (p, q) and NH (p, N q) to (p, q) (see §
40 as well as Appendix 1, rules (2. 4) and (2. 5)), the noteworthy fact results that N (p, q) is logically
equivalent to NM (p, q) and (p, q) to M (p, q). In other words: N (p, N q) and M (p, q) are only
apparently logical weakenings of NM (p, N q) and (p, q), respectively.
Among the systems of modal logic set up by C.I. Lewis, the so-called S1 is distinguished by its
lacking the axiom ◇(p & q) ⥽◇p. Lewis calls this axiom the ‘consistency postulate’ and thus
indicates that only a statement that is without contradiction and to that extent possible can be
part of a conjunction that is without contradiction and to that extent possible. See Lewis & Lang-
ford 1932, 166–67.

Appendix 5
Modern Non-Syllogistic Systems of Modal Logic
in Their Relationship to Modal Syllogistic
(To §§ 58 to 63)
1. The system of modal logic that was presented above in §§ 58 to 63 as a sub-
system of the elementary syllogistic is distinguished by its strict universal validity
from systems of modal logic which have been constructed on the basis of rules of
propositional logic and laws of the logical calculus of functions. In the following, I
would like to indicate the systematic relationship between the basic modal-logical
rules established in § 60 and these other systems. In doing so, I will draw atten-
tion to logically relevant distinctions that appear in the four most famous of these
systems (the systems T, S4, S5, and the Brouwerian system (B)).
For that purpose, it is first necessary to specify how the meanings of the logi-
cal constants M and L are related to the meanings given by the expressions ‘it is
possible that . . .’ and ‘it is necessary that . . .’, when they are used in connection
with truth-functional expressions.
According to rules (IV. 5), (IV. 20), and (IV. 21) (see § 60 and § 61 above), L A is
logically equivalent both to NMN A and to LNN A. Just so is M A, according to
rules (IV. 3), (IV. 30), and (IV. 31), logically equivalent to NLN A and MNN A. If we
replace ‘N A’ and ‘NN A’ in the expressions used in these rules with the corre-
sponding truth-functional expressions, namely with ‘~ A’ and ‘~ ~ A’ respectively,
the logical equivalence relations are not preserved. For according to § 71, defini-
tion 4, as well as Appendix 3 (cf. also § 30), ‘~ A’ is not equivalent to ‘N A’, but
rather to ‘(N A, H (NN A, A)’.
Hence, M A is logically equivalent neither to NL ~ A, nor to M ~ ~ A. But by
means of a new sign, – I will use the diamond sign ‘◇. . .’ introduced by C.I.
Lewis,249 which has been customary in modal logic ever since – we can formulate
two new basic rules, according to which it holds that:
◇A ≻≺NL ~ A,
(M. 1)
◇A ≻≺M ~ ~ A.
(M. 2)
These rules of course do not render a logical but rather only a regular equivalence,
namely, an equivalence which obtains between ◇A on the one hand and NL ~ A
The sign ‘◇’ occurs first in Lewis’ and Langford’s Symbolic Logic in 1932.

and M ~ ~ A on the other, if and only if the postulate of the affirmative use of double
negation (VI. 4) (see § 72) is assumed as valid. For on this assumption the meaning
of ‘~ . . .’ turns into the meaning of ‘N . . .’ (see the corollary to definition 4 in § 71;
cf. also § 10 and § 30, as well as Appendix 3). Consequently, on precisely this assump-
tion the meaning of ‘◇. . .’ likewise turns into the meaning of ‘M . . .’. The expres-
sion ‘◇A’ as it appears in (M. 1) and (M. 2) may thus be read just like ‘M A’: ‘It is
possible that A’. But it should be noted that this reading is ambiguous, since the
meanings of ‘◇A’ and ‘M A’ must be logically distinguished.
For exactly similar reasons, I utilize the box sign ‘□. . .’ introduced by Ruth
Barcan Marcus, and also customary in modal logic since then, to be able to render
two further rules, namely:
□A ≻≺NM ~ A,
(M. 3)
□A ≻≺L ~ ~ A.250
(M. 4)
These equivalence rules hold on the same condition as rules (M. 1) and (M. 2). On
this condition, but also only on this condition, one may read the expression ‘□. . .’
as it appears here as though it means the same thing as ‘L . . .’.
From (M. 2) and (M. 4), by inference conversion according to rule (I. 2) (see § 44)
the equivalence rules
NM ~ ~ A ≻≺N ◇A,
(M. 5)
NL ~ ~ A ≻≺N □A
(M. 6)
can be derived. Next, from (M. 1) and (M. 6) and from (M. 3) and (M. 5) respectively
the following rules can be derived, if one equates A with ~ B in (M. 1) and (M. 3)
and A with B in (M. 5) and (M. 6):
◇~ B ≻≺N □B,
(M. 7)
□~ B ≻≺N ◇B.
(M. 8)
On the basis of rule (VI. 2) (see § 72), according to which the change from ~ A to N A
and conversely from N A to ~ A is permitted, so long as the postulate of the affirma-
tive use of double negation (VI. 4) is valid, the following two rules are also valid:
◇~ B ≻≺~ □B,
(M. 9)
□~ B ≻≺~ ◇B.
(M. 10)
The necessity sign ‘□’ first appears in the paper ‘A Functional Calculus of First Order Based
on Strict Implication’, which Ruth C. Barcan Marcus (still under the name Barcan) published in
the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1946.

Appendix 5

Both these rules are truth-functional analogues to the modal-syllogistic rules (IV.
4) and (IV. 6). By replacing B in (M. 9) and (M. 10) everywhere with ~ A, we then
get from these rules together with (M. 2) and (M. 4) truth-functional analogues to
rules (IV. 3) and (IV. 5), namely:
◇A ≻≺~ □~ A,
(M. 11)
□A ≻≺~ ◇~ A.
(M. 12)
The intermodal rules (M. 9) to (M. 12) can, as has just been shown, be derived from
the modal-syllogistic intermodal rules (IV. 3) to (IV. 6), though only by assuming
that the postulate of the affirmative use of double negation (VI. 4) (see § 72) is valid.
On the same assumption, further analogues to the modal-syllogistic rules can
be derived as well. Namely, since according to rule (IV. 1) (see § 60) a necesse esse
valet consequentia holds, so that ~ ~ A follows logically from L ~ ~ A, since more-
over ~ ~ A implies A according to rule (VI. 22) (see § 75), the weakening rule
□A ≺A
(M. 13)
can be derived from (M. 4). In the same way, one can derive a further weakening
rule from (M. 2), namely
A ≺◇A.
(M. 14)
For A implies ~ ~ A, according to rule (VI. 21) (see § 75), and according to (IV. 25)
(see § 61) M ~ ~ A follows logically from ~ ~ A – since ab esse ad posse valet con-
sequentia also holds –, so that from M ~ ~ A, according to (M. 2), the transition to
◇A is permitted.
In addition, the rule of ‘strict detachment’ can be derived from detachment
rule (VI. 8) (see § 74) together with the weakening rule (M. 13):
□(A ⊃B), A ≺B.
(M. 15)
Since according to (VI. 21) and (VI. 22) the transition both from A to ~ ~ A as well
as conversely from ~ ~ A to A is permitted, according to rule (IV. 19) (see § 61) the
transition from L A to L ~ ~ A to L A is permitted as well. For the same reason,
according to rule (IV. 29) (see § 61), the transition from M A to M ~ ~ A and con-
versely from M ~ ~ A to M A is permitted. Hence, on the basis of (M. 2), the rule ◇
A ≻≺M A holds, and on the basis of (M. 4), the rule □A ≻≺L A holds:
◇A ≻≺M A
(M. 16)
□A ≻≺L A
(M. 17)

By conditionalization, that is according to rule (II. 1) (see § 48), the rule □(A ⊃B)
≺H (A, B) can be obtained from (M. 15). Since in addition, according to rule (IV. 2)
(see § 60), it also holds that L B logically follows from H (A, B) together with L A,
the rule □(A ⊃B), □A ≺□B follows from (M. 15) together with (M. 17), and from
this rule, by conditionalization (according (II. 1)), the rule □(A ⊃B) ≺H (□A,
□B) follows. From this, according to rule (VI. 7) (see § 71), yet only on the assump-
tion that the postulate of the arbitrary sufficient reason (VI. 3) (see § 72) is valid,
the distributive rule
□(A ⊃B) ≺(□A ⊃□B)
(M. 18)
can be derived. Finally, on the same assumption and in a similar way, the rule
□(A ⊃B) ≺(◇A ⊃◇B)
(M. 19)
can be derived from (M. 15) by conditionalization. For according to rule (IV. 29) it
holds that H (M A, M B) follows logically from H (A, B). According to modus po-
nendo ponens (II. 2) (see § 48), M B follows from H (M A, M B) together with
M A. Hence, on the basis of (M. 16), □(A ⊃B), ◇A ≺◇B also holds. By condition-
alization and subsequent application of rule (VI. 1), we get (M. 19).
The following comparison shows that there is for nine of the just derived for-
mulas (M. 1) to (M. 19) an analogous formula in the modal syllogistic:
In the last three lines of this table, the formulas (II. 2′), (IV. 19′), and (IV. 29′) indi-

one can easily recognize, can be derived directly from formulas (II. 2), (IV. 19), and
(IV. 29), with the help of rule (IV. 1). The truth-functional analogues of all ten formu-
las of this table are not mere translations of one language into another, but rather
expressions for a new type of modal-logical rule. The most important distinction

between these and the modal-syllogistic rules standing opposite them is that the
truth-functional rules are not strictly universally valid. Rather, their validity corre-
lates exactly with the validity of the postulates of the affirmative use of double ne-
gation and the arbitrary sufficient reason (VI. 3).
2. Now, the systematic relationship between the modal syllogistic I have presented
and the most important or most well-known axiomatic modal-logical systems can
be described in the following way. All these systems contain the propositional part
of the calculus of functions (described by me above in §§ 77 to 81). They contain it
either by the fact that all theorems of the classical propositional calculus are deriv-
able from the axioms of the modal-logical system or by the fact that they explicitly
assume the propositional calculus as valid when they expand it through the addi-
tion of certain modal-logical axioms and rules. The first mentioned version of an
axiomatization of modal logic underlies the various systems which Lewis developed.
By contrast, the idea for the second version, to axiomatize modal logic through an
extension of classical propositional calculus, stems from Kurt Gödel.251
In line with this idea, Robert Feys worked out the so-called ‘system T’, whose
basic features I render here in a modified notation. The only modal-logical axioms
of this system (in addition to the axioms of the classical propositional calculus) are
the two following:
□p ⊃p,
(Necessity Axiom)
□(p ⊃q) ⊃(□p ⊃□q).
(Distributive Axiom)
They can be attained directly from rules (M. 13) and (M. 18) by de-conditionalization
(according to II. 27) (see § 50) and subsequent transformation into subjunctions (ac-
cording to (VI. 1) (see § 71)). The first of the three following definitions corresponds
to rule (M. 11) in T:
◇A = Def ~ □~ A
A ⥽B = Def □(A ⊃B)
(A = B) = Def ((A ⥽B) & (B ⥽A))
The two remaining definitions reduce the use of the signs of strict implication ‘⥽’
and of strict equivalence ‘=’ to the use of ‘□’ and ‘⊃’ and ‘&’. The necessity rule –
according to which it holds that when ⊦A is a theorem, then ⊦□A is a theorem –
also holds as a transformation or derivation rule in T (in addition to the rules of
substitution and detachment, which are already used in the calculus of functions).
On this, compare Appendix 6 and Hughes & Cresswell 1977, 217–18.

It corresponds to this rule that if ✶≺A is a valid law, it is impossible that ✶≺L A is
invalid.
The so-called Brouwerian System is distinguished from System T only by in-
troducing an additional modal-logical axiom, the so-called Brouwerian Axiom:252
p ⊃□~ □~ p.
(B)
There are two alternatives to the Brouwerian System, namely the systems set up by
Lewis under the names S4 and S5.253 They, too, can be characterized by the fact
that they each add to the axioms of System T an additional axiom. In S4, the axiom
□p ⊃□□p,
(S4)
takes the place of the Brouwerian Axiom, while in S5 the axiom
◇A ⊃□~ □~ A.254
(S5)
takes the place of the Brouwerian Axiom.
In the modal syllogistic I have described, there are analogues neither to the
Brouwerian Axiom nor to the Axioms S4 and S5. That is, according to the defini-
tions of the modal-logical constants ‘M . . .’ and ‘L . . .’ there is no valid basic rule
from which one of the three following rules can be derived: (1) A ∴LNLN A, (2)
Though the name of the Brouwerian Axiom refers to the founder of intuitionistic mathemat-
ics Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, it does not go back to him but rather to Oskar Becker; see
Becker 1930, 509. The relation to Brouwer’s intuitionism seems somewhat far-fetched, but it
stems from the fact that from the intuitionistic perspective, p ⊃~ ~ p but not ~ ~ p ⊃p is valid. If
one interprets (as recommended by Kurt Gödel (see Appendix 6)) the negation sign here (the
meaning of which is not defined in the intuitionistic axiomatic system developed by Brouwer’s
student Arend Heyting) as an abbreviation for ‘□~’, then the result is that ~ ~ p ⊃p becomes the
formula □~ □~ p ⊃p, which is not regarded as valid in any of the Systems T, S4, and S5, while p
⊃~ ~ p transforms into the formula p ⊃□~ □~ p, which is equivalent to p ⊃□◇p.
The letter ‘S’ stands for ‘strict’ in these labels. The connected numerals indicate that there is a
sequence of axiomatically constructed systems beginning with S1 in which each system n + 1 con-
tains each system n.
Lewis himself attained the systems S4 and S5 not by starting from system T and adding the
axioms designated as (S4) and (S5) to it, but rather by starting from a system called S3 and adding
to it in S4 the axiom ~ ◇(~ p) ⥽~ ◇~ (~ ◇(~ p)) and in S5 the axiom p ⥽~ ◇(~ ◇p). The system
S3 is similar to system T inasmuch as it contains the axiom ~ ◇p ⥽~ p instead of the necessity
axiom and the axiom (p ⥽q) ⥽(~ ◇q ⥽~ ◇p) instead of the distributive axiom. On the construc-
tion of the Lewis-systems, compare the section “The Lewis-Systems” in Hughes & Cresswell 1977,
213–54.

Appendix 5

L A ∴LL A, or (3) M A ∴LNLN A. This situation requires an explanation, which I
will provide in what follows.
3. The definitions established in § 59 fix the uses of ‘L . . .’ and ‘M . . .’ so that they
are not restricted to certain specific contexts in terms of content. Likewise, the
colloquial uses of ‘it is possible that . . .’ and ‘it is necessary that . . .’ are not re-
stricted to specific contexts either. Rather, they are unrestricted in the same way
as the use of the hypothetical proposition ‘if . . ., then . . .’, which indeed may be
understood as equivalent to ‘LN (. . ., N . . .)’ and ‘NM (. . ., N . . .)’ and whose
meaning can be fixed so that it is suitable to represent an arbitrary ‘if-then’-
relation, i.e., an arbitrary relation of regular consequence. I have fixed the mean-
ing of ‘H (. . ., . . .)’ in § 47 so that it is applicable to hypothetical propositions of
arbitrary content. Because of this, the meanings of ‘LN (. . ., N . . .)’ and ‘NM (. . .,
N . . .)’ are also fixed so that the rules whose validity can be rendered by means
of these expressions are rules of arbitrary content (whether they are, e.g., conven-
tions whose scope is restricted to an arbitrarily small set of individuals, or rules
with a regional or temporary scope, or rules which are derivable from laws of
nature but are valid only within the bounds of prior experiences, or logical rules
whose scope encompasses all possible worlds, etc.).255
Accordingly, the necessity which can be rendered by propositions of the form
H (p, q), LN (p, N p), and NM (p, N q), is not a special kind of absolute or relative
necessity, but rather a modality which lies at the common basis of all special
types of absolute and relative necessity. ‘L . . .’ (in the sense of ‘necessarily (true
that) . . .’) thus means the same thing as ‘in all thinkable circumstances (it is true
that) . . .’ (cf. § 59, def. 2), whereby it depends on the context which universe of
discourse of thinkable circumstances the expression ‘in all thinkable circumstan-
ces’ tacitly assumes (as a non-empty domain). Though this expression can, it need
not mean the same thing as ‘in all possible worlds’. Hence, the assumed universe
of discourse of thinkable circumstances need not coincide with the total content
of all possible worlds. Rather, this domain coincides in each case with the totality
of circumstances which the rules at issue in the given context refer to or to which
they can be applied. The domain coincides with the scope of these rules in each case,
which need not coincide with the domain which encompasses all possible worlds.
For this reason, propositions like ‘If I have the desire tomorrow evening, I will go to the cin-
ema’, ‘If one does not comply with a no-passing zone, then one may receive a fine’, ‘If a castling
is performed, then the rook jumps over the king’, or ‘If something is necessarily true, then it also
actually true’ should be understood as propositions of the same logical form and transformed
into propositions of the form LN (p, N q).
Modern Non-Syllogistic Systems of Modal Logic
343

Thus, e.g., the proposition, ‘Necessarily, the square on which the knight stands
changes color with every move’, means that under all thinkable circumstances (that
fall within the scope of the rules of chess which are tacitly assumed to be valid) the
color of the square of the knight changes from white to black or from black to white
when it is played. The thinkable circumstances here are the moves which are think-
able according to the rules of chess as they are assumed to be valid. In just the same
way, the proposition ‘It is possible that a pawn jumps over a square’ means that (ac-
cording to the assumed rules of chess) there is a thinkable circumstance in which a
pawn’s jumping over a square occurs. Here again it is the totality of possible chess
moves that implicitly constitutes the scope of the assumed rules and the domain of
thinkable circumstances for which these rules have validity, which includes the
opening move in a game of chess. The proposition ‘It is impossible that a castling is
performed and the rook does not jump over the king’ says that the given domain
contains no element which has the property of being a castling where a rook does
not jump over the king.
These examples deal with necessity, possibility, and impossibility by assuming a
totality of thinkable circumstances as an application domain for valid rules, without
this totality being equated immediately with the totality of possible worlds. If the
proposition that a change in square color is necessary with every move of a knight
were understood as if it stated that this change took place in all possible worlds,
then it would be false, since, e.g., a world is readily thinkable with a chess rule ac-
cording to which an opening move is possible in which a knight is moved without
changing square colors. Likewise, the impossibility of a castling in which the king is
not jumped over is not due to there being no possible world in which such a castling
occurs, since a world is readily thinkable where a castling involves a king jumping
over a rook and not the opposite. Finally, the possibility that a pawn jumps over a
square does not depend on the fact that there is a world among all possible worlds
in which such a jump takes place. Instead, the statement that it is possible to allow
the pawn to jump over a square is already false if, e.g., with the introduction of a
new opening rule the supposition on which the truth of that statement depends is
abolished – although even after this abolishment it would remain totally thinkable
that there is a world in which a pawn jumps over a square.
Rather than choosing my example propositions from the context of chess, I
could have selected them from any other context (from the fields of mathematics,
psychology, physics, logic, and other sciences, as well as from the fields of everyday
habits as from political life and otherwise), to elucidate the connection that exists
between the modalities of necessity, possibility, and impossibility on the one hand
and on the other hand the domains thinkable circumstances that are assumed with
them in each case, to which the relevant rules refer.
344
Appendix 5

When specifically logical necessity, logical possibility, or logical impossibility is
at issue, here too, as with the other use of the modal expressions (‘necessarily’, ‘pos-
sibly’, and ‘impossibly’), the modality is at issue only with respect to rules. Yet in this
case they are specifically logical rules, which, provided they are strictly universally
valid, are rules which can refer in their scope and domain of application to a uni-
verse of discourse of thinkable circumstances that can also be interpreted as the
totality of possible worlds. For strictly universally valid logical rules can be trans-
formed into ‘if-then’-propositions and hence also into propositions involving neces-
sity, from which propositions involving possibility are ultimately derivable. To be
sure, the modality rendered by ‘L . . .’ and ‘M . . .’ in these propositions can again be
interpreted here so that ‘L . . .’ is equivalent to ‘in all thinkable circumstances (it is
true that) . . .’ and ‘M . . .’ to ‘in some thinkable circumstances (it is true that) . . .’.
But the universe of discourse of thinkable circumstances to which strictly univer-
sally valid logical rules refer encompasses the universe of all possible worlds and
hence permits equating what is true in all thinkable circumstances with what is
true in all possible worlds and permits understanding ‘true in some circumstance’
in the sense of ‘true in some possible world’.
Now of course the rules of modal logic do not necessarily need to consider
distinctions in the meaning and use of the modal expressions ‘necessarily’ and
‘possibly’ which stem from a given universe of discourse. Rather, if the use of
these expressions is supposed to be strictly universally valid, they must abstract
completely from these distinctions. Namely, as strictly universally valid rules they
are (as per § 82 and § 83) formal-logical rules, i.e., rules which abstract from dis-
tinctions in content between propositions and whose validity depends only on the
meaning of the logical constants that occur in the propositions to which they are
related. The modal syllogistic that I described in §§ 58 to 63 only contains rules
which are formal and abstract in this sense.
This is the reason why the modal syllogistic recognizes only very few rules for
so-called iterated modalities, i.e., for sequences of operators (as in ‘LL . . .’ or
‘LNLN . . .’), as strictly universally valid. In this respect, only those rules are univer-
sally valid which rely on the mere substitution of a modally definite expression (as
‘L B’) in the expression of a universally valid rule (e.g., ‘L A ∴A’). That is, though
the rules LL B ∴L B and M B ∴MM B are valid, it is because the rules L A ∴A and
A ∴M A are valid. Yet the rules L A ∴LL A and M A ∴LNLN A, which are analo-
gous to the S4- and S5-axioms, respectively, are invalid. The invalidity of these rules
can be proved through examples as follows.
Let L p stand for a valid rule of chess, according to which the proposition ‘It is
necessary that with the change of the square on which a knight stands, the color of
the square changes’ is true. However, if L p is true, the proposition LL p need not
also be true. That is, if it is true that in all thinkable circumstances (according to
Modern Non-Syllogistic Systems of Modal Logic
345

the rules of chess assumed as valid), moving a knight involves changing the square
color, it need not also be true that in all circumstances there must be circumstances
the rules of chess remain valid according to which a knight’s move must be tied to
the change of a square’s color. To see this, it suffices to recall that rules of play are
changeable, so that circumstances are thinkable in which even the thinkable cir-
cumstances as they are assumed in the rules of chess can change. There is thus also
a thinkable circumstance in which the rule of chess rendered by L p is invalid.
Namely, it is invalid when, e.g., after the introduction of a new rule for the opening
moves of a knight, an exception to the old rule is permitted. Thus, if L p is true, it is
nonetheless thinkable that LL p is false and thus MNL p true. Hence, the inference
(analogous to the S4-axiom) from L p to LL p is not universally valid.
A second example: let M p stand for the proposition ‘It is possible that a pawn
jumps over a square’. This proposition is true if the rules of chess from which it
follows are valid. However, if it is true, the proposition LNLN p need not also be
true. Namely, LNLN p is equivalent to LM p, i.e., equivalent to the proposition ‘It
is necessary (or true in all thinkable circumstances) that (according to the rules of
chess assumed as valid) it is possible that a pawn jumps over a square’. This propo-
sition is false. For in no way is it true in all thinkable circumstances (according to
the rules of chess assumed as valid) that it is possible that a pawn jumps over a
square. Instead, a circumstance is thinkable in which this is not possible. Such a
circumstance obtains when, by changing the rules of the game, the currently valid
exception to the rule that a pawn can never jump over a square is no longer per-
mitted. Thus, if M p is true, it is nonetheless thinkable that M p is false. The infer-
ence (analogous to the S5-axiom) from M p to LM p is hence not universally valid.
Neither may one infer, without any further addition, from p to LM p (analo-
gous to the B-axiom). This can be seen in the following way: let p stand for the
proposition ‘A white knight takes a black pawn in the first two moves’. Let this
proposition be true and let it describe an actual move in chess that has just been
performed. Yet it does not follow from the fact that it is true that the proposition
LM p is also true. Namely, it is not true in all thinkable circumstances that the
move just played (according to the rules of chess assumed as valid) is possible.
Rather, a circumstance is thinkable in which it is not possible, namely, e.g., in the
just described circumstance where the currently valid exception to the old rule
that a pawn can never jump over a pawn is no longer permitted, while all other
rules remain. In this circumstance, openings moves are regulated so that a white
knight cannot make a play on a black pawn in the first two moves. Hence, if p is
true, LM p need not also be true.
Accordingly, the rule A ∴LNLN A is invalid as well. Hence, among the modal-
syllogistic rules there is no universally valid rule which could be considered an
analogue to the Brouwerian axiom.
346
Appendix 5

4. Incidentally, we can also see here that the rules of the modal syllogistic differ
in another way from the basic assumptions of the Brouwerian system and sys-
tems S4 and S5, as well as those of the system T. The system T differs from the
modal syllogistic (as has been shown above in sections 1 and 2 of this appendix)
only by assuming the validity of the classical propositional calculus. By contrast,
the other three systems differ from the modal syllogistic still further by assuming
for the axioms peculiar to each,
p ⊃□~ □~ p,
(B)
□p ⊃□□p, and
(S4)
◇p ⊃□~ □~ p,
(S5)
special interpretations of the concepts of necessity and possibility.
We can gain insight into the validity of the S5-axiom – thus indirectly that of
the Brouwerian and the S4-axiom –, first, by assuming that necessity is the same as
truth in all possible worlds and that possibility is the same as truth in at least one
possible world, and, second, by supposing that the totality of possible worlds coin-
cides with the totality of thinkable worlds, and the thinkability of one world places
demands on the thinking ability of the inhabitants of all possible worlds, which they
equally satisfy. For on these assumptions the S5-axiom states that there is no possi-
ble world in which p is true unless it is true in all possible worlds, that there is a
possible world in which p is true. According to the assumed interpretation, this
means that there is (for the thinking ability of the inhabitants of all possible worlds)
a thinkable world in which p is true. But then it must also hold that □~ □~ p. For □
~ □~ p means, according to the assumed interpretation, that it is true in every
thinkable world (for the thinking ability of the inhabitants of all possible worlds)
that a world is thinkable (for these inhabitants) in which p is true.
As Saul A. Kripke first showed, one can modify the interpretation of the con-
cepts of necessity and possibility assumed here so that the S5-axiom is invalid but
the validity of the S4-axiom or the Brouwerian axiom remains intact.256 This mod-
ification requires giving up the strong assumption that the inhabitants of all pos-
sible worlds satisfy in the same way the demands which the thinkability of a
world places on the thinking ability which is present in that world itself and in
the rest of the possible worlds. This assumption can be replaced by a weaker one,
namely, that the thinkability of a world is only a reflexive and transitive, but not a
symmetrical relation. According to this assumption, for arbitrary possible worlds
W1, W2, and W3, if W3 is thinkable in W2, and W2 in W1, then W3 is thinkable in

Kripke is given by Hughes & Cresswell 1977, 75–80.

W1 as well. It also holds on this assumption that in each possible world that world
itself is thinkable, but that when one of them (say, W1) is thinkable in another
world (say, W2), then also the latter world is always thinkable in the former. For on
this assumption, whatever holds for W1 holds for each of these worlds. Thus, the
proposition that □p is true means for W1 the same as that p is true in all worlds
thinkable in W1. According to the assumption just described, even the worlds that
are thinkable in the worlds thinkable in W1 belong to those worlds thinkable in
W1. Thus, if p is true in all worlds thinkable in W1, there is no world thinkable in W1
in which it is not also true that p is true in all worlds thinkable in W1. Hence, if it is
true in W1 that □p, it is also true in W1 that □□p. Hence, on this assumption the
S4-axiom is valid. By contrast, on this assumption, neither the S5-axiom nor the Brou-
werian axiom is valid. For if it is true in W1 that ◇p or that p, this means that in one
of the worlds thinkable in W1 or in W1 itself it is true that p. But neither this world
thinkable in W1 nor W1 itself need be thinkable in each of the worlds thinkable in
W1. Hence, on this assumption □~ □~ p follows neither from ◇p nor from p.
Yet if one supposes as an alternative to this assumption that the thinkability
of a world is not a transitive but rather a symmetrical and reflexive relation, then
the Brouwerian axiom, though not the S4- or S5-axiom, seems to be valid. In that
case, one merely supposes that, for any possible worlds W1 and W2, if W2 is
thinkable in W1, then W1 is thinkable in W2, and that any possible world is think-
able in itself. On this assumption, the supposition that p is true means the same
for W1 as that p is true in W1. Now if p is true in W1, it is at the same time also
possible that p. For there is then for W1 a thinkable world in W1 in which p is
true, namely W1. Moreover, among the worlds thinkable in W1, there are none in
which it would not also be true that there is a thinkable world in which p is true.
For W1 belongs, as we assumed, among the worlds which are thinkable in all the
worlds thinkable in W1. Hence, if p is true in W1, it is also true in W1 that it is
necessarily possible that p. In other words, □~ □~ p follows from p. Hence, on
the assumption we mentioned, the Brouwerian axiom is valid. Yet the S5-axiom,
according to which □~ □~ p follows from ◇p, is not thereby valid as well.
Namely, if it is true that ◇p, and consequently that there is in W1 a thinkable
world in which p is true, it does not follow from this that this world is also think-
able in every world which is thinkable in W1.
As these considerations show, quite special interpretations of the concepts of
necessity and possibility lie at the basis of the systems B, S4, and S5.
5. The question is sometimes raised about which modal-logical system is really
‘the correct’ one. If one relates this question only to the systems which assume
classical predicate logic as valid, which includes the Brouwerian system and the
systems T, S4, and S5, then the answer apparently depends merely on what
348
Appendix 5

meaning one wants to give to the expressions ‘□. . .’ and ‘◇. . .’. For this mean-
ing varies with the strength and weakness of each system, depending on the axi-
oms and basic rules which are supposed to hold in it. The semantics of possible
worlds developed by Kripke, which I sketched in its rudiments above, has contrib-
uted to making these distinctions in meaning more precise.
Yet if one considers the complex meaning which the expressions ‘□. . .’ and
‘◇. . .’ have even in the weakest of these systems, and then factors into the as-
sessment the modal-logical system I have described, it will emerge that only the
latter satisfies the demands of strict universal validity. For only this system is inde-
pendent of the specific assumptions on which the classical predicate logic depends,
insofar as it accepts the postulates of the affirmative use of double negation (VI. 4)
and arbitrary sufficient reason (VI. 3) (see § 72). As for the four systems considered
above, T, S4, S5, and the Brouwerian system, the system T is closer to the modal
syllogistic than the rest. For one already gets from the modal syllogistic to system T
simply by assuming postulates (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) as valid.
Yet by making such assumptions, modal logic loses its strict universal validity
and thus its proximity to the rules and laws which lie at the basis of all thought.
This loss is manifested by the fact that on the assumption of postulates (VI. 3) and
(VI. 4) the so-called paradoxical theorems of strict implication, namely the theorems
‘(A & ~ A) ⥽B’ and ‘B ⥽(A ∨~ A)’, are derivable in modal logic. These theorems are
called ‘paradoxical’ not because they are invalid in all circumstances – this of
course is not the case. They are rather called ‘paradoxical’ because their derivabil-
ity was precisely what Lewis had originally wanted to avoid with his invention of
systems of strict implication.

Non-Classical Systems of Logic in Their Relationship
to the Logical Calculus of Functions
The formulas derived in § 75,
✶≺A ⊃(B ⊃A),
(VI. 17)
✶≺(A ⊃(B ⊃C)) ⊃((A ⊃B) ⊃(A ⊃C)),
(VI. 18)
✶≺(~ B ⊃~ A) ⊃(A ⊃B), and
(VI. 23)
✶≺(∀v) A (v) ⊃A (t),
(VI. 24)
together with the formulas which are derivable from them according to the sim-
ple detachment rule (VI. 8) and one of the two generalization rules (VI. 10) and
(VI. 11), form the system of the basic laws of the logical calculus of functions,
which is usually simply called ‘classical logic’ today. Since underlying this system
is the assumption that the four rules
A, B ≺A,
(VI. 3)
NN A ≺A,
(VI. 4)
N A ((‘v) A (v), α) ≺I ((‘v) N A (v), α), and
(VI. 5)
N A ((‘v) N A (v), α) ≺I ((‘v) A (v), α)
(VI. 6)
are valid, alternatives to classical logic (and thus systems of so-called ‘non-classical
logic’) result by taking one of two measures: either (1) dispensing with the supposi-
tion of the unrestricted validity of at least one (if not all) of these four rules, or (2)
retaining this supposition but assuming in addition the validity of at least one fur-
ther rule or further law.
Among the systems which arise from measure (2) belongs the system of strict
implication, but also other modal-logical systems, such as, e.g., the system T and
the so-called Brouwerian system. (I discussed all these systems in Appendix 5.)
To provide examples for the first type of non-classical logical systems as well,
which arise from measure (1), I mention in what follows the systems of ‘paracon-
sistent’, ‘free’, and ‘intuitionistic’ logic and will briefly describe them in turn from
the point of view of interest here. From this point of view, all the non-classical
logical systems mentioned here have one core stock of logical rules in common.
This core stock coincides with the rules of syllogistic I have described, which also
(as has been shown in this book) underlie classical logic.
A logical system is called ‘paraconsistent’ when the principle that from two con-
tradictory statements an arbitrary statement follows (ex contradictione quodlibet
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-018

sequitur) is not recognized as valid.257 This principle presupposes the validity of
rules (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) (see § 72), according to which A follows from A and B, and A
follows from NN A (with arbitrary propositions A and B). Namely, by inference con-
version (according to rule (I. 2) (see § 44)) it can be immediately derived from (VI. 3)
(with B = N C and arbitrary C) that NN C (with arbitrary B) follows from A and
N A. And then according to (VI. 4) NN C may equal C and ~ A may take the place of
N A (see § 71). Thus, if one presupposes that rules (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) are valid, then it
also holds that from A and ~ A an arbitrary proposition C follows. This means that
paraconsistent systems of logic which do not recognize the principle ex contradic-
tione quodlibet assume that at least one of the rules (VI. 3) and (VI. 4) is invalid. As-
suming the invalidity of (VI. 4) forces paraconsistent logic into an understanding of
the negation sign ‘~’ as equivalent to ‘N’ or into a modal-logical reading of the nega-
tion ‘~’ as well as the expression ‘it is false that . . .’.258 Assuming the invalidity of
rule (VI. 3) must not lead to an elimination of this rule without replacement, but
rather always permits the mere restriction of the validity of this rule, so that it re-
mains valid in the case in which B is the empty set of premises in A, B ≺A, so that
A ≺A is a valid rule.259
As for so-called free logic, it results from the implicit renunciation of the valid-
ity of rules (VI. 5) and (VI. 6) and from the implicit retention of the validity of rules
(VI. 3) and (VI. 4) (see § 72). Free logic differs from classical logic precisely in that it
allocates no object in the model of the system to the individual constants, free
The designation ‘paraconsistent’ was suggested by M. Quesada at a Latin American symposium
on mathematical logic for logical systems in which the principle ex contradictione quodlibet does
not hold. Cf. Anderson, Belnap & Dunn 1992, vol. 2. In the sense of this designation, all so-called rele-
vant-logical systems are paraconsistent. They are labeled this way because they insist that it does
not suffice for the truth of a conditional proposition that its antecedent is false; rather, it must also
be ‘relevant’ for the succedent. The system of the elementary syllogistic I have presented in this
book is also paraconsistent. This system traces the invalidity of the principle ex contradictione quod-
libet as well as the principle ex falso quodlibet back to the truth-ambivalence of expressions of the
form N A. Because of this ambivalence, the rule according to which propositions follow from them-
selves is not universally valid. For the same reason, a proposition A is neither equivalent in all cir-
cumstances nor logically equivalent to the proposition ‘It is true that A’.
The resort to modal logic was taken by authors like Stanislaw Jaśkowski (1969) and Richard
Routley (1977). The reading of negation recommended by Da Costa (1974) essentially amounts to an
equation of ‘~’ with ‘N’.
A logical system is called ‘monotonic’ when it allows that nothing changes in the validity of a
consequence when one adds a premise to it which contributes nothing to the validity of the conse-
quence. Classical logic is monotonic because it assumes the validity of (VI. 3). By contrast, a paracon-
sistent logical system is non-monotonic if it restricts the validity of (VI. 3) in the manner described.

Appendix 6

variables, or individual identifiers (definite or indefinite descriptions).260 When one
makes the renunciation just mentioned, it results that neither the law of instantia-
tion (VI. 24) nor the rules of generalization ((VI. 10) and (VI. 11)), particularization
(VI. 12), or singularization (VI. 15) are valid for free logic. Indeed, all these rules de-
pend on rules (VI. 5) and (VI. 6), as can be easily gathered from the relevant proofs
in § 74 and § 75.261
Finally, intuitionistic logic can likewise be regarded as an example of the first
type of non-classical system, namely, as a system of logic that dismisses rule (VI. 4) as
invalid, but at the same time continues to accept rules (VI. 3), (VI. 5), and (VI. 6).262
The validity of the law-formula (VI. 21) derived in § 75 depends on the validity of rule
(VI. 4), as the relevant proof shows. Though Heyting’s intuitionistic formula language
is consciously demarcated from the classical formula language, if one interprets his
preferred though uninterpreted sign ‘¬’ so that it corresponds to the negation sign ‘~’
used in classical logic, it turns out that the intuitionistic propositional calculus con-
tains the classical predicate calculus as a proper sub-system, in which the law ren-
dered by formula (VI. 21), ~ ~ A ⊃A, is invalid (cf. Gödel 1933b, 34–8).
Yet one can also interpret intuitionistic logic so that it is an example of taking
measure (2) mentioned above, so that it then belongs among non-classical logical
systems which arise from classical logic not by implicitly omitting but rather by
implicitly adding validity assumptions. Namely, intuitionistic logic in the form
sketched by Heyting leaves the sign ‘¬’ and all logical propositional connectives
undefined yet at the same time explicitly understands the formula ‘¬ ¬ p ⊃p’ so
that it does not mean exactly the same thing as the formula ~ ~ p ⊃p in classical
logic, but rather has a meaning colored by modal logic, according to which it
says: ‘If it is impossible that p can be false, then it is correct’ (Heyting 1930, 189).
On this account, the intuitionistic propositional calculus appears as a mere vari-
ant of a modal-logical system in which the classical propositional calculus is
The earliest recommendation of a corresponding revision to classical quantificational logic
stems from Henry Leonard (1956). The name ‘free logic’ was introduced by Karel Lambert as an
abbreviation for ‘logic free of existence assumptions with respect to both its general terms and its
singular terms’. A systematic presentation of the basics of free logic is given in Bencivenga 1986.
Karel Lambert (1998, 740) writes: “Indeed, free logic is the culmination of a long historical
trend to rid logic of existence assumptions with respect to its terms.” Regarding the history of logic
as a whole, this singling-out of free logic as a “culmination” is a massive distortion of the facts.
Since in the framework of the Aristotelian syllogistic, existence assumptions with respect to con-
cept expressions are entirely unnecessary, it never needed to “rid” itself of these assumptions.
The earliest elaboration of an intuitionistic logical calculus stems from Arend Heyting (1930),
published under the title “Die formalen Regeln der intuitionistischen Logik”.

contained as a sub-system. Kurt Gödel (1933c, 39–40) carried out a corresponding
interpretation of this calculus.263
According to Gödel, one can interpret the sign ‘¬’ and the logical propositional
connectives of this calculus so that its system contains not only the classical pro-
positional calculus as a sub-system, but also a modal-logical system S, which is an
exact analogue of the system T, extended with the S4-axiom.264 System S differs
from the latter only by everywhere using the concept of provability in place of
the concept of necessity. Since provability is supposed to mean either the same as
necessary truth or a certain kind of necessary truth,265 one can say that system S
is not only an exact analogue to system T extended with the S4-axiom. It is rather
precisely the same as system T, yet related to cases in which the operator ‘□. . .’
(‘it is necessary that . . .’) takes the special (or only specially colored) meaning of
‘it is provable that . . .’. Gödel uses the abbreviation ‘B . . .’ for ‘it is provable that
. . .’. If one translates the Heytingian expressions ‘¬ . . .’, ‘. . . ⊃. . .’, ‘. . . ∨. . .’,
and ‘. . . ∧. . .’ in turn into the expressions, ‘~ B . . .’, ‘B . . . ⊃B . . .’, ‘B . . . ∨B . . .’,
and ‘. . . & . . .’ (whereby the signs used in the translation ~, ⊃, ∨, and & render
in turn truth-functional negation, subjunction, adjunction, and conjunction, as
in the classical propositional calculus), then the formulas which are valid in
Heyting’s system (but also only them) transform into formulas which are deriv-
able from the system S.266 By contrast, the Gödelian translation of the formulas
¬ ¬ p ⊃p and p ∨¬ p is not derivable. Quite generally, no formula of the form
B A ∨B B follows from S unless either B A or B B is already provable from S
(Gödel 1933c, 201).
One can understand both formulas ¬ ¬ p ⊃p and p ∨¬ p so that they express
the principle of affirmation by (double) negation (which is often identified with
the principle of excluded middle by intuitionists). Indeed, if one says that intui-
tionistic logic rejects this principle as invalid, one cannot have in mind the intui-
tionistic propositional calculus in the modal-logical interpretation just described.
Gödel’s interpretation refers to Heyting’s 1930 calculus.
Gödel himself could admittedly not yet have in view the system T, which was first set up by
Robert Feys (1937), as he undertook his modal-logical interpretation of the intuitionistic proposi-
tional calculus. In Appendix 5, I have described the system T extended with the S4-axiom inas-
much as it is of interest here.
Edward John Lemmon has pointed out that if ‘□. . .’ means the same as ‘it is informally
provable in mathematics that . . .’, S4 is the correct modal system. See E.J. Lemmon 1959.
The translation described here is not the only one which leads to this result. Rather, the de-
sired derivability can also be achieved by translating ‘¬ . . .’ and ‘. . . ∧. . .’ with ‘B ~ ◇. . .’ and
with ‘B . . . & B . . .’, respectively. See Gödel 1933c, 39. – Gödel uses the Hilbertian notation, i.e.,
the arrow and the point, for truth-functional subjunction and truth-functional conjunction,
respectively.
354
Appendix 6

For according to this interpretation, the intuitionistic propositional logic allows
the classical propositional logic to hold unrestrictedly, so that even the postu-
late of the affirmative use of double negation fundamental to the latter (VI. 4)
(see § 72 above) and the formula (VI. 22), ~ ~ A ⊃A, which follows from this
principle, remain valid in it.267
As Kurt Gödel has proved, the Heytingian propositional calculus is not the only one which
differs from the classical version by rejecting tertium non datur. Rather, there are infinitely
many calculi which lie as it were between these two calculi and are designated as ‘intermediary’
systems of logic. Indeed, the invalidity of p ∨¬ p does not necessarily preclude that, e.g., ¬ p ∨¬ ¬
p is valid and can be established as an axiom in one of these calculi. Cf. Gödel 1932, 65. There is
no reason to assume that one of these infinitely many calculi is set apart from the others. Yet the
Heytingian calculus is set apart from these and from the classical propositional calculus by admit-
ting an interpretation according to which it rejects postulate (VI. 4), which is not logically universally
valid, without replacing it with another assumption that is not logically universally valid.

Appendix 7
The Barcan Formula
The Barcan formula
◇(∃x) A (x) ⥽(∃x) ◇A (x)
renders an axiom with which axiomatic modal propositional logic can be ex-
tended into a modal predicate logic. The name of this formula refers to Ruth Bar-
can Marcus, who introduced this axiom in 1946 (see Barcan 1946). It has become a
controversial starting point for philosophical discussions, since it suggests an in-
terpretation according to which it entails the supposition (which is not very plau-
sible) that it follows from the fact that it is possible that objects with a certain
property exist that objects (actually) exist which possibly have this property. Ruth
Barcan Marcus herself rejected this interpretation and replaced it with a so-called
‘substitutional’ interpretation. According to the latter interpretation, the Barcan
formula is supposed merely to state that if it is possible that there is a substitution
instance for x which transforms an expression of the form A (x) into a true ex-
pression of the form A (a), there is then a substitution instance for x which trans-
forms an expression of the form ◇A (x) into a true expression of the form ◇A (a).
The substitutional interpretation gives the existential quantifier a reading which de-
parts from the ‘classical’ one and can be applied to non-modalized classical quantifi-
cational logic as well. According to this reading
~ (∃x) A (x) ⊃(∃x) ~ A (x)
does not mean that from a statement of the form ~ (∃x) A (x) it follows that some-
thing, namely x, exists, to which A (x) does not apply, but rather only that from a
statement of the form ~ (∃x) A (x) no true statement can arise by replacing ‘(∃x)
. . . (x)’ with the specification of a suitable singular case, unless by the same re-
placement a true statement also arises from (∃x) ~ A (x). In this way, in place of
the classical assumption that there is for every true particular proposition of the
form (∃x) A (x) an existing object, the substitutional interpretation prefers the
assumption that there is for every such proposition a true singular proposition
even if the object which it treats does not exist.
Yet this assumption is hardly less problematic than the classical one. For sin-
gular propositions which deal with an object that does not exist (or, more pre-
cisely, which does not belong to the domain of individuals, i.e., a “world of
attributions”, which is assumed to be satisfied (see § 20 above)) will not ordinarily
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-019

be regarded as true (except in the case of certain negative propositions). This or-
dinary view, which agrees with the principle of qualitative existential import, is
accommodated by the definition of the singular categorical proposition I estab-
lished in § 52.
If one places this definition at the basis of universally valid rules and laws of
logic, one cannot expect the Barcan formula to express a universally valid logical
law. One cannot even expect that the expression analogous to the Barcan formula,
H (M I ((′x) A (x), ξ), I ((′x) M A (x), ξ)),
renders a universally valid law of modal logic. Rather, the degree of validity of
the axiom that renders the Barcan formula corresponds at best to the degree of
validity which can be ascribed to the S4- and S5-axioms. (See Appendix 5.)
One can consider the expression (∃x) ◇A (x), occurring on the right side of the
Barcan formula, as an expression of a pure de re modality. For it is a de re expres-
sion which is not (like syllogistic expressions of modality (see § 6 and § 59)) equiva-
lent to a de dicto expression of the same modality. Considered in this way, the
Barcan formula renders the law (which is not universally valid) that the de dicto
possibility which is stated by a problematic particular proposition implies a pure de
re possibility.
According to §§ 31–32 and §§ 64–65, the expression (∃x) ◇A (x) is only an
abbreviation for
‘I ((′x) ◇A (x), ξ)’.
The modality indicated by ‘◇’ here belongs only to the content of a concept,
namely the logical predicate (′x) ◇A (x). It alters nothing in the assertoric affir-
mative form, which the formula ‘I ((′x) ◇A (x), ξ)’ renders as the logical form of
an affirmative proposition. A proposition of this form has existential import that
is unrestricted and independent of its conceptual content. The existential import
of an affirmative proposition is restricted, however, if the prefix ‘◇’ (or ‘M’) is
placed in front of it, as in ‘◇I ((′x) A (x), ξ)’. This prefix decreases its modal-logical
strength. And a proposition of greater logical strength cannot follow from a prop-
osition of lesser logical strength. For this reason, it is not universally valid that ‘I
((′x) ◇A (x), ξ)’ follows from ‘◇I ((′x) A (x), ξ)’, nor that ‘(∃x) ◇A (x)’ follows
from ‘◇(∃x) A (x)’.

Appendix 8
On Bivalence
(To §§ 6 to 9)
From the perspective of ‘logical pluralism’ (Beall & Restall 2006) there is no reason
to single out a two-valued logic from any many-valued logic. But one will have to
decide in favor of a two-valued logic if one understands the basis of the bivalence
principle, and if one demands that logic be formal in a narrow, clear, and clearly
explicable sense (as I have specified it above in § 82 and § 83). In what follows, I
first (1) attend to the question of the grounds of the validity of the bivalence princi-
ple. I then (2) turn to the connection between bivalence and formality.
(1) The bivalence principle is to be understand so that it states that for expres-
sions which as declarative propositions are used as judgments there are exactly
two truth values: the true (T) and the false (F). The supposition that there are no
more than these two values does not rest on some profound discovery, but rather
merely on a linguistic stipulation of the meaning of ‘true’ and ‘false’. The biva-
lence principle consists in this stipulation. It stipulates that a proposition may be
taken as false if and only if it is not true.268 Even a meaningless proposition like
‘Ten is a wicked number’ (which as a meaningless proposition is not true) is to be
regarded as false according to this stipulation. If one prefers to say that, because
it is meaningless, it is rather neither true nor false, then one has decided on a dif-
ferent use of the word ‘false’ and has with this use already assumed that there is
a third truth value (namely, that of the meaningless) and thus that the bivalence
principle should not hold.
According to the bivalence principle, ‘true’ should not be understood as im-
plying a time-dependent but rather a timeless being the case or truth.269 According
to this principle, what is true today will not be false tomorrow, and what is not
true today will still be false tomorrow. This means that the truth of even time-
related statements, e.g., true predictions, is not time-dependent. If one says of a
prediction that it has become true, then one helps oneself to a usage according to
which ‘true’ means a time-dependent truth, which the bivalence principle ex-
cludes. Connected with this alternative usage is the notion that the truth of a pre-
dictive statement as it were matures with time and comes to completion only
The bivalence principle thereby also stipulates that a proposition is not false if and only if it
is true.
For a discussion of the distinction between time-dependent and timeless truth, compare von
Wright 1974, esp. 174–77.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-020

with the arrival of the foretold event; only with the event does it become actual
and as it were complete and mature truth. If one says that a prediction has be-
come true, that is not supposed to mean that it was false up to the arrival of the
event it foretold and then immediately changes to a true statement. Rather, it is
supposed to mean that there is a time at which it is neither (entirely) true nor
(entirely) false. To think in this way that a time-dependent statement about the
future can have the property of being neither true nor false is certainly allowable
and not perverse. Yet in thinking this way one has given the word ‘true’ a mean-
ing which it does not have according to the bivalence principle. To this extent,
‘many-valued’ logics do not invalidate the validity of the bivalence principle and
give no cause to call in question the ‘correctness’ of two-valued systems of logic.
Yet ‘many-valued’ logics have been developed precisely in the opinion that the
bivalence principle can have no or only a restricted validity, since statements
which refer to future contingents (contingentia futura) are capable of being nei-
ther true nor false. Underlying this opinion is the conviction that if one accepts
the principle of two-valuedness for statements about the future and believe that
what is true tomorrow is also already true today, then one will have to suppose
that the future is inescapably predetermined by the past.270 According to this con-
viction, logic oversteps its domain of competency, since in assuming the bivalence
principle, it commits itself to a deterministic picture of the world.
In truth, however, the bivalence principle is perfectly compatible with inde-
terminism. In order to see this, one need only assume for the sake of argument
that determinism is false. On this assumption, the statement that as a result of an
event that was not predetermined a sea battle will take place tomorrow is, accord-
ing to the bivalence principle, true or false. If this statement is not false, according
to the bivalence principle it is true, and this entirely independently of what time
it is made. But if it is true, indeterminism is true as well, since along with the
statement it is indeed supposed that there is an event that is not predetermined
which results in the sea battle having taken place. Hence, even if one is unsympa-
thetic to determinism, one need not abandon the bivalence principle. Statements
about contingentia futura do not require us to introduce a logic which accepts, in
According to a reading that Ockham (1957) in his Tractatus de Praedestinatione Dei et de Futu-
ris Contingentibus gave to chapter nine of Aristotle’s De Interpretatione, Aristotle had there rejected
the principle of two-valuedness with respect to statements about the future. The development of a
many-valued logic by Jan Łukasiewicz in the 1920s was based on the idea that the bivalence princi-
ple must favor fatalism. See Łukasiewicz 1970, especially the essays “On Three-Valued Logic” (1920),
“On Determinism” (1922), and “Philosophical Remarks on Many-Valued Systems of Propositional
Logic” (1930).

addition to the values 1 (= T) and 0 (= F), an intermediate value like the indefinite
(= ½) or probability values.
The time-dependent truth of a predication precisely does not consist in its
being always already fixed in advance that it will be the case. An event’s being
fixed in advanced (or predetermined) means of course that its arrival follows un-
avoidably from preceding events on the basis of natural laws or that its arrival
cannot be prevented by a decision, no matter how powerful. ‘It is already fixed
today that p’ is thus neither equivalent to, nor even entailed by, the statement ‘It
is true that p’. To be sure, preceding events on the basis of natural laws are caus-
ally relevant for the truth of p, but whether the arrival (and truth) of p already
follows solely on the basis of natural laws from preceding events, or whether
there are additional factors on which this arrival depends according to rules
which are not natural laws but of another kind instead (rules of traffic, war, con-
vention, morality, etc.), is not yet settled simply on the basis of the truth of p. The
proposition ‘What is true tomorrow is already true today’ can thus be understand
so that it is free from any deterministic inflection and says simply, for any arbi-
trary statement p: if it is true tomorrow that tomorrow it will be the case that p,
this means that the statement that, on the day that is (today) called ‘tomorrow’, it
is the case that p is true, and it is true not only tomorrow and today but entirely
independently of the time at which it is stated.
Even if the statement contains a relative time specification like ‘tomorrow’,
this does not alter the fact that it has a timeless truth value all the same. For state-
ments with relative time specifications get their meaning from the point in time
within which they are positioned and can be transformed into equivalent state-
ments with absolute time specifications, i.e., into statements with a specification
of the type ‘On January 15, 2009 . . .’. To that extent, even statements with relative
time specifications have a time-independent truth value.271 The fact that these
time specifications can refer to the future does not make it necessary to assume
more than two timeless truth values. But these values must be understood as
timeless if one accepts the bivalence principle in its complete generality.
By way of summary, one can say that the bivalence principle only stipulates
a certain usage, by stipulating that ‘false’ is equivalent to ‘not true’ and that
‘truth’ means a timeless being the case of statements. In light of the fact that the
words ‘true’ and ‘false’ can also be used differently, one should not hope to decide
That there are declarative propositions whose truth value can only be decided in the future
does not need to mean that they have up until this decision either no truth value at all or only a
truth value lying between true and false or a probability value. Rather, according to the bivalence
principle, if a decision about the truth value of a declarative proposition has not yet been made, or
will never be made, or is not even possible, this value may be unknown, but it is not indefinite.

which usage is ‘the correct’ one. For one can use words as one pleases, so long as
one sticks to the meaning that one has given them (see § 8 above). Whether the
bivalence principle should hold or not is to that extent only a question of linguis-
tic convention.
As a principle of propositional logic, it can remain safely in effect.
(2) Yet as a principle of a strictly formal propositional logic, it should remain in
effect. This can be seen in the following way.
Variables in propositional logic are characterized by the fact that they stand
for arbitrary declarative propositions. From a logical point of view, arbitrary de-
clarative propositions have the property of being true or false. For only by refer-
ence to this property can it be said what a valid inference from declarative
propositions consists in at all. The values T and F must therefore be taken into
account in every logic. But in formal logic, no more than these two values can be
taken into account. For if one wanted to demand of formal logic that it distin-
guishes declarative propositions which are neither true nor false from those
which are true or false, one would have to ascribe to it a capability of specifying
criteria according to which the sphere of non-true declarative propositions could
be further divided into false and non-false propositions, so that the designation
‘false’ would apply only to a part of non-true propositions. However, formal pro-
positional logic has no such criteria at its disposal. For as formal propositional
logic, it does not bring into consideration actual declarative propositions but only
variables which stand for arbitrary declarative propositions. In order to distin-
guish, e.g., false from meaningless or false from indefinite or false from probable
declarative propositions, formal logic would have to abandon its formal stand-
point and bring into consideration declarative propositions with respect to prop-
erties from which it precisely abstracts in its propositional variables. That is, it
would have to apply criteria for dividing declarative propositions which concern
the content of propositions, which are not at its disposal due to its formal stand-
point. Thus, one cannot reasonably demand of a strictly formal propositional logic
that it goes beyond the distinction between true and false.
The same thing holds for a strictly formal predicate logic. To be sure, as predi-
cate logic it goes beyond propositional logic insofar as it considers the truth of
statements as an applying to something, namely, an applying to that about which
statements say something, i.e., an applying of predicates to subjects of statements
(see § 27, § 33, and § 65, remark). A strictly formal predicate logic does not go be-
yond the dissection of declarative propositions into predicates and subjects. For
this reason, the concept variables it uses, α, β, etc., can stand for arbitrary and thus
even empty concepts. And the bivalence principle suffices for the assessment of
362
Appendix 8

statements with empty concepts.272 That is, in a strictly formal predicate logic, un-
like in the (‘classical’) predicate logic of the calculus of functions, such statements
do not need to be eliminated from consideration from the outset (see § 35); they
can rather simply be treated as false. The task of distinguishing between false and
meaningless (or nonsensical) singular statements only arises by introducing the
postulate of non-empty domains, i.e., by introducing the not universally valid (and
not formal) rules (VI. 5) and (VI. 6) (see § 72). The validity of these rules is assumed
in the predicate logic of the logical calculus of functions, but not in a strictly formal
predicate logic.
In this way, the unrestricted recognition of the bivalence principle belongs
among the marks by which formal logic, both in its propositional as well as its
predicate-logical parts, is distinguished quite essentially from non-formal logics.
In this respect, it is not a matter of ‘arbitrary’ decision but is rather tied insepara-
bly to the formality of formal logic.273
Aristotle seems to have assessed the situation similarly. He formulates the bivalence princi-
ple in De Interpretatione 8. 18 a 34 ff. by saying that every affirmative and negative proposition is
either true or false. It is consistent with this that he means that one says either something true or
something false when one says something about something (Metaphysics 4. 7, 1011 b 27 ff.), and
that one must either ascribe or deny some predicate to an object (Metaphysics 4. 7, 1011 b 24); a
predicate either applies or does not apply to an object (De Interpretatione 18 a 35 ff.). Christopher
Kirwan (1971, 118) comments on the cited passage in Metaphysics 4. 7 with the following words:
“‘The present King of France is neither wise nor not wise; for the expression “the present King of
France” is not being, or on the occasion of utterance cannot correctly be, used to refer to anyone’:
Aristotle nowhere comments on this kind of case, but he might have held that the sentence
makes no assertion, or asserts nothing ‘of one thing’, and is therefore no exception to the rule
that we must assert or deny one thing of one thing (cf. De Interpretatione 8).”

Appendix 9
Absolute Logical Constants
Symbols hold the selfsame significance for thinking as
did the discovery of using the wind to sail cross-wind for
navigation. Let no one be contemptuous of signs! A good
deal depends on a practical selection on them.
(Frege 1882b, 107 [1964b, 156])
The question of which expressions should be regarded as logical constants can only
be stated relatively, namely, always only in relation to the respective logical system
in which they are used – unless they are expressions of logical vocabulary which
express the logical form of propositions (in the sense of § 83) and are needed to
render rules and laws which belong to the common core of all logical systems.
These expressions could reasonably be called ‘absolute logical constants’.
If one asks for secure criteria by which it is possible to decide whether an ex-
pression is an absolute logical constant and belongs to the vocabulary that is suit-
able to fix and express the logical form of propositions, it suffices to point out four
marks which such an expression must exhibit:
1.
An absolute logical constant is an expression with one or more than one
empty place, such that all these places are suited to be filled either by a con-
cept expression or by a declarative proposition, and by filling all empty pla-
ces in each case a declarative proposition arises.
2.
An absolute logical constant is, as a component of a declarative proposition,
capable of fixing simply through its meaning that this proposition follows regu-
larly from other declarative propositions or that other declarative propositions
follow regularly from it, regardless of the content of all the components that
take the place of concept- or propositional variables in this proposition. (Here
regular consequence is meant in the sense explained in § 43, definition 4.)
3.
An absolute logical constant is an expression which can be used to render a
stable hierarchical conceptual relation (in line with Figure 1 of § 1 and § 6) with
a declarative proposition which makes explicit what the proposition applies to
if it is true.
4.
Expressions which satisfy the first three criteria can only count as absolute
logical constants if an analysis of their meaning does not show them to be
composed of expressions of which at least one already satisfies one of the
first three criteria. –
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-021

Comment: According to these four criteria, e.g., the expressions ‘. . . is greater
than . . .’, ‘. . . is equal to . . .’, ‘. . . is identical with . . .’ are not absolute logical
constants. All three satisfy the second criterion. For whether a proposition of the
form ‘if x is greater than y, then z is greater than y’ follows regularly from a prop-
osition of the form ‘z is greater than x’ rests only on the meaning of ‘. . . is greater
than . . .’, regardless of what the variables ‘x’, ‘y’, and ‘z’ stand for. But since these
variables can be taken neither as concept variables nor as propositional varia-
bles, the first criterion is not satisfied. (The reasons why the third and fourth crite-
ria are not satisfied either can be easily seen as well.)
One might have supposed that expressions like ‘most . . . are . . .’ or ‘only a
few . . . are . . .’ belong to the vocabulary of formal logic in the narrow sense.
They do satisfy the first two criteria, since, e.g., a proposition of the form ‘only a
few α are not β’ follows regularly from a proposition of the form ‘most α are β’,
and both ‘α’ and ‘β’ are concept variables. For this reason, they are treated as logi-
cal constants in an extended syllogistic. Yet we can see that they do not satisfy the
fourth criterion by analyzing the meaning of propositions of the form ‘most α are
β’. Such an analysis shows that these propositions do not only contain statements
about the relative amount of objects that fall under the concepts α and β or under
the concepts α and not-β, respectively, but they also contain statements which
can be rendered by two propositions of the form ‘some α are β’ and ‘some α are
not β’, whose logical constants each satisfy the first three criteria.
Expressions which tend to be treated as logical constants in so-called deontic
logic – namely, the (deontic) modal expressions ‘it is required that . . .’, ‘it is for-
bidden that . . .’, and ‘it is permitted that . . .’ – should also be subjected to an
analysis of this kind. It is clear first of all that they satisfy the first two criteria,
since for arbitrary interpretations of the propositional variable ‘p’ it holds, e.g.,
that a proposition of the form ‘it is not permitted that not p’ follows regularly
from ‘it is required that p’. However, one can easily see that these expressions
only abbreviate more complex logical expressions which are tied to a specific
content. This content stems from the way each of these expressions points implic-
itly to the validity of a tacitly assumed norm, whether it be a moral principle, a
legal injunction, or a command. Thus, ‘it is required that p’ has the form of a nec-
essary proposition and is equivalent to ‘L [if the norm in question is not violated,
then p]’. Similarly, ‘it is forbidden that p’ means the same as ‘L [if the norm in
question is not violated, then N p]’, and ‘it is permitted that p’ means the same as
‘NL [if the norm in question is not violated, then p]’. It is due to this meaning that,
while p follows logically from L p (as per § 60, rule (IV. 1)), a proposition p follows
neither logically nor regularly from a proposition of the form ‘it is required that
p’. Rather, p only follows regularly from this requirement if the norm which it
implicitly points to is not violated but is obeyed.
366
Appendix 9

Finally, hypothetical propositions of a specific content also hide behind ex-
pressions which are treated as elementary logical constants in so-called temporal
logic, namely, the (temporal) modal expressions ‘it has always been the case that
. . .’ and ‘it will always be the case that . . .’.274 Thus, ‘it has always been the case
that p’ is equivalent to ‘L [if p is in the past, then p]’. Similarly, ‘it will always be
the case that p’ is equivalent to ‘L [if p is in the future, then p]’. p can only be
derived from both formulas if the assumption expressed by the respective ‘if’-
clause of these formulas is satisfied.
According to a widespread doctrine, the most important logical constants in
modern predicate logic are the so-called quantifiers ‘∀. . . (. . .)’ (‘for every . . . it
holds that: . . .’) and ‘∃. . . (. . .)’ (‘there is a . . . such that: . . .’). That these expres-
sions are likewise abbreviations of more complex expressions I have shown in
§§ 31 to 35 (cf. § 64 and § 65).
The expressions (a) ‘it has always been the case that . . .’ and (b) ‘it will always be the case
that . . .’ are elementary expressions of temporal logic insofar as one can trace back to them (c)
‘it has been the case that . . .’ and (d) ‘it will be the case that . . .’, respectively, since (c) is equiva-
lent to ‘N (a) N . . .’ and (d) is equivalent to ‘N (b) N . . .’.
