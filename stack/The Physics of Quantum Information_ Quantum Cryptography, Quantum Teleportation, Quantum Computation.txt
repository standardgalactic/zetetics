Preface 
Information is stored, transmitted and processed by physical means. Thus, 
the concept of information and computation can be formulated in the con-
text of a physical theory and the study of information requires ultimately 
experimentation. This sentence, innocuous at first glance, leads to non-trivial 
consequences. 
Following Moore's law, about every 18 months microprocessors double 
their speed and, it seems, the only way to make them significantly faster 
is to make them smaller. In the not too distant future they will reach the 
point where the logic gates are so small that they consist of only a few 
atoms each. Then quantum-mechanical effects will become important. Thus, 
if computers are to continue to become faster (and therefore smaller), new, 
quantum technology must replace or supplement what we have now. But 
it turns out that such technology can offer much more than smaller and 
faster microprocessors. Several recent theoretical results have shown that 
quantum effects may be harnessed to provide qualitatively new modes of 
communication and computation, in some cases much more powerful than 
their classical counterparts. 
This new quantum technology is being born in many laboratories. The last 
two decades have witnessed experiments in which single quantum particles of 
different kinds were controlled and manipulated with an unprecedented preci-
sion. Many "gedanken" experiments, so famous in the early days of quantum 
mechanics, have been carried out. New experimental techniques now make 
it possible to store and process information encoded in individual quantum 
systems. As a result we have a new, fledgling field of quantum information 
processing that represents a highly fertile synthesis of the principles of quan-
tum physics with those of computer and information science. Its scope ranges 
from providing a new perspective on fundamental issues about the nature of 
physical law to investigating the potential commercial exploitation by the 
computing and communications industries. 
As part of the worldwide effort in the field, the European Commission, 
within the framework of the TMR (Training and Mobility of Researchers) 
programme, is supporting a network entitled "The Physics of Quantum In-
formation" . The chapters in this book are mainly written by various members 
of the network in different forms of collaboration, and they are all intended 

VI 
Preface 
to give a didactic introduction to essential, new areas. In addition, several 
sections present important achievements by researchers outside the TMR net-
work. However, it was not our aim to write a monograph giving a complete 
overview of the field. Research in this field has become very active, and any 
comprehensive review of the field would be obsolete in a short time. The 
topics that are covered by this book include theoretical and experimental 
aspects of quantum entanglement, quantum cryptography, quantum telepor-
tation, quantum computation, quantum algorithms, quantum-state decoher-
ence, quantum error correction, and quantum communication. 
We hope that this book will be a valuable contribution to the literature 
for all those who have a modest background in quantum mechanics and a 
genuine interest in the fascinating possibilities that it is offering us. 
We are very grateful to Thomas Jennewein for the numerous figures that 
he drew for this book.

1. The Physics of Quantum Information: 
Basic Concepts 
D. Bouwmeester, A. Zezlinger 
1.1 Quantum Superposition 
The superposition principle plays the most central role in all considerations of 
quantum information, and in most of the "gedanken" experiments and even 
the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Instead of studying it theoretically or 
defining it abstractly, we will discuss here the quintessential experiment on 
quantum superposition, the double-slit experiment (Fig. 1.1). According to 
Feynman [1], the double-slit "has in it the heart of quantum mechanics". The 
essential ingredients of the experiment are a source, a double-slit assembly, 
and an observation screen on which we observe interference fringes. These 
interference fringes may easily be understood on the basis of assuming a wave 
property of the particles emerging from the source. It might be mentioned 
here that the double-slit experiment has been performed with many different 
kinds of particles ranging from photons [2], via electrons [:3], to neutrons [4] 
and atoms [5]. Quantum mechanically, the state is the coherent superposition 
(1.1) 
where IPa ) and IPb ) describe the quantum state with only slit a or slit b open. 
The interesting feature in the quantum double-slit experiment is the obser-
vation that, as confirmed by all experiments to date, the interference pattern 
can be collected one by one, that is, by having such a low intensity that only 
one particle interferes with itself. If this happens, we might be tempted to ask 
ourselves which of the two slits a particle "really" takes in the experiment. 
The answer from standard quantum mechanics is that it is not possible to 
make any sensible statement about the question "which slit does the parti-
cle pass through?" without using the appropriate set-up able to answer that 
question. In fact, if we were to perform any kind of experiment determining 
through which of the two slits the particle passes, we would have to somehow 
interact with the particle and this would lead to decoherence, that is, loss of 
interference. Only when there is no way of knowing, not even in principle,

in an observation plane behind a double-slit assembly, even if the intensity of t he

interference pattern shown here is the experimental data obtained for a double-slit 
experiments with neutrons [4J. 
through which slit the particle passes, do we observe interference. As a small 
warning we might mention that it is not even possible to say that the particle 
passes through both slits at the same time, although this is a position often 
held. The problem here is that, on the one hand, this is a contradictory sen-
tence because a particle is a localised entity, and, on the other hand, there 
is no operational meaning in such a statement. We also note that one can 
have partial knowledge of the slit the particle passes at the expense of partial 
decoherence. 

1.2 Qubits

1.2 Qubits 
The most fundamental entity in information science is the bit. This is a 
system which carries two possible values, "0" and "1". In its classical reali-
sation the bit, which, for example could be imagined to be just a mechanical 
switch, is a system which is designed to have two distinguishable states; there 
should be a sufficiently large energy barrier between them that no sponta-
neous transition, which would evidently be detrimental, can occur between 
the two states. 
The quantum analog of a bit, the Qubit [6], therefore also has to be a 
two-state system where the two states are simply called 10) and 11). Basically 
any quantum system which has at least two states can serve as a qubit, and 
there are a great variety possible, many of which have already been realised 
experimentally. The most essential property of quantum states when used 
to encode bits is the possibility of coherence and superposition, the general 
state being 
IQ) = adQ) + (311) , 
(1.2) 
with lal 2 + 1/31 2 = 1. What this means is not that the value of a qubit is some-
where between "0" and "1", but rather that the qubit is in a superposition 
of both states and, if we measure the qubit we will find it with probability 
lal2 to carry the value "0" and with probability 1f31 2 to carry the value "1"; 
(1.3) 
While by the definition of the qubit we seem to lose certainty about its prop-
erties, it is important to know that (1.2) describes a coherent superposition 
rather than an incoherent mixture between "0" and "1". The essential point 
here is that for a coherent superposition there is always a basis in which 
the value of the qubit is well defined, while for an incoherent mixture it is a 
mixture whatever way we choose to describe it. For simplicity consider the 
specific state 
IQ') = ~(IO) + 11)). 
(1.4) 
This clearly means that with 50% probability the qubit will be found to be 
either in "0" or "1". But interestingly, in a basis rotated by 45° in Hilbert 
space the value of the qubit is well-defined. We might simply study this 
by applying the proper transformation to the qubit. One of the most basic 
transformations in quantum information science is the so-called Hadamard 
transformation whose actions on a qubit are 
HIO) ---+ ~(IO) + 11)), Hll) ---+ ~(IO) -11)). 
(1.5)

1. Basic Concepts 
Applying this to the qubit IQ') above, results in 
HIQ') = 10). 
(1.6) 
that is, a well-defined value of the qubit. This is never possible with an 
incoherent mixture. 
1.3 Single-Qubit Transformations 
Insight in some of the most basic experimental procedures in quantum infor-
mation physics can be gained by investigating the action of a simple 50/50 
beamsplitter. Such beamsplitters have been realised for many different types 
of particles, not only for photons. For a general beamsplitter, as shown in 
Fig. 1.2, let us investigate the case of just two incoming modes and two 
outgoing modes which are arranged as shown in the figure. 
For a 50/50 beamsplitter, a particle incident either from above or from 
below has the same probability of 50% of emerging in either output beam, 
above or below. Then quantum unitarity, that is, the requirement that no 
particles are lost if the beamsplitter is non-absorbing, implies certain phase 
conditions on the action of the beamsplitter [7] with one free phase. A very 
simple way to describe the action of a beamsplitter is to fix the phase relations 
such that the beamsplitter is described by the Hadamard transformation of 
(1.5). 
Let us again assume that the incident state is the general qubit 
(1. 7) 
For a single incident particle this means that Q: is the probability amplitude 
to find the particle incident from above and /3 is the probability amplitude for

Hadamard transform H (below).

finding the particle incident from below. Then the action of the beamsplitter 
results in the final state 
1 
IQ)out = HIQ)m = .j2 ((a + ,6)IO)out + (a - ,6)11)out) , 
(1.8) 
where (a +,6) is now the probability amplitude for finding the particle in the 
outgoing upper beam and (a - ,6) is the probability amplitude for finding it 
in the outgoing lower beam. For the specific case of either a = ° or ,6 = 0, 
we find that the particle will be found with equal probability in either of the 
outgoing beams. For another specific case, a = ,6, we find that the particle 
will definitely be found in the upper beam and never in the lower beam. 
It is interesting and instructive to consider sequences of such beamsplit-
ters because they realise sequences of Hadamard transformations. For two 
successive transformations the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (Fig. 1.3) with 
two identical beamsplitters results. 
Furthermore, the mirrors shown only serve to redirect the beams; they 
are assumed to have identical action on the two beams and therefore can 
be omitted in the analysis. The full action of the interferometer can now 
simply be described as two successive Hadamard transformations acting on 
the general incoming state of (1.7): 
(1.9) 
This results from the simple fact that double application of the Hadamard 
transformation of (1.5) is the identity operation. It means that the Mach-
Zehnder interferometer as sketched in Fig. 1.3, with beamsplitters realising 
the Hadamard transformation at its output, reproduces a state identical to 
the input. Let us consider again the extreme case where the input consists 
of one beam only, that is, without loss of generality, let us assume a = 1, 
the lower beam being empty. Then, according to (1.9), the particle will def-

transformations (bottom).

initely be found in the upper output. Most interestingly, this is because be-
tween the two beamsplitters the particle would have been found (with the 
correct relative phase) with equal probability in both beam paths. It is the 
interference of the two amplitudes incident on the final beamsplitter which 
results in the particle ending up with certainty in one of the outgoing beams 
and never in the other. 
In quantum information language, the output qubit of the empty Mach-
Zehnder interferometer will have a definite value if the input qubit also has 
a definite value, and this only because between the two Hadamard transfor-
mations the value of the qubit was maximally undefined. 
Another important quantum gate besides the Hadamard gate is the phase 
shifter, which is introduced additionally in Fig. 1.4 into the Mach- Zehnder 
interferometer. Its operation is simply to introduce a phase change 'P to the 
amplitude of one of the two beams (without loss of generality we can assume 
this to be the upper beam because only relative phases are relevant). In our 
notation, the action of the phase shifter can be described by the unitary 
transformation 
4>10) = e'<PIO), 4>11) = 11). 
(1.10) 
Therefore the output qubit can be calculated by successive application of all 
proper transformations to the input qubit: 
(1.11) 
We leave it to the reader to calculate the general expression for arbitrary 
input qubits. We will restrict our discussion again to the case where we have 
only one input namely 0: = 1 and (3 = 0, i.e., IQ)in = 10). The final state 
then becomes

Fig. 1.4. Top: Mach- Zehnder interferometer including a phase shifter 'P in one 
of the two beams. This completely changes the output. Bottom: The equivalent 
representation with Hadamard transformations and a phase shifter gate. 

1.4 Entanglement 
7 
This has a very simple interpretation. First we observe by inspection of (1.12) 
that for <p = 0 the value of the qubit is definitely "0". On the other hand, for 
<p = 7r the value of the qubit is definitely "1". This indicates that the phase 
shift <p is able to switch the output qubit between 0 and 1. In general, the 
probability that the output qubit has the value "0" is Po = cos2(<p/2), and 
the probability that the qubit carries the value "I" is PI = sin2(<p/2). 
In the present section we have discussed some of the basic notions of linear 
transformation of qubits. We will now turn to entangled qubits. 
1.4 Entanglement 
Consider a source which emits a pair of particles such that one particle 
emerges to the left and the other one to the right (see source S in Fig. 1.5). 
The source is such that the particles are emitted with opposite momenta. If 
the particle emerging to the left, which we call particle 1, is found in the up-
per beam, then particle 2 travelling to the right is always found in the lower 
beam. Conversely, if particle 1 is found in the lower beam, then particle 2 is 
always found in the upper beam. In our qubit language we would say that 
the two particles carry different bit values. Either particle 1 carries "0" and 
then particle 2 definitely carries "1", or vice versa. Quantum mechanically 
this is a two-particle superposition state of the form 
(1.13) 
The phase X is just determined by the internal properties of the source and 
we assume for simplicity X = O. Equation (1.13) describes what is called an 
entangled state [8]1. The interesting property is that neither of the two qubits 
carries a definite value, but what is known from the quantum state is that 
as soon as one of the two qubits is subject to a measurement, the result of 
this measurement being completely random, the other one will immediately 
be found to carry the opposite value. In a nutshell this is the conundrum of 
quantum non-locality, since the two qubits could be separated by arbitrary 
distances at the time of the measurement. 
A most interesting situation arises when both qubits are subject to a 
phase shift and to a Hadamard transformation as shown in Fig. 1.5. Then, 
for detection events after both Hadamard transformations, that is, for the 
case of the two-particle interferometer verification [10] for detections behind 
the beamsplitters, interesting non-local correlations result which violate Bell's 
inequalities [11]. Without going into the theoretical and formal details here 
(for more information see Sect. 1.7), the essence of such a violation is that 
1 The word Entanglement is a (free) translation of the word Verschriinkung that 
was introduced in 1935 by Schrodinger to characterise this special feature of 
composite quantum systems [9].

Fig. 1.5. A source emits two qubits in an entangled state. Top: A two-particle 
interferometer verification. Bottom: The principle in terms of one-photon gates 
there is no possibility to explain the correlations between the two sides on 
the basis of local properties of the qubits alone. The quantum correlations 
between the two sides cannot be understood by assuming that the specific 
detector on one given side which registers the particle is not influenced by the 
parameter setting, that is, by the choice of the phase for the other particle. 
There are many ways to express precisely the meaning of Bell's inequali-
ties, and there are many formal presentations. Some of this discussion will 
be presented in Sect. 1.7, and for the remainder we refer the reader to the 
appropriate literature (e.g., Ref. [12] and references therein). 
A very interesting, and for quantum computation quite relevant gener-
alisation follows if entanglement is studied for more than two qubits. For 
example, consider the simple case of entanglement between three qubits, 
as shown in Fig. 1.6. We assume that a source emits three particles, one 
into each of the apparatuses shown, in the specific superposition, a so-called 
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state [13] (see also Sect. 6.3), 
1 
J2(IOhI0/210/3 + 11hll/211/3)' 
(1.14) 
This quantum state has some very peculiar properties. Again, as in two-
particle entanglement, none of the three qubits carries any information on 
its own, none of them has a defined bit value. But, as soon as one of the 
three is measured, the other two will assume a well-defined value as long as 
the measurement is performed in the chosen 0-1 basis. This conclusion holds 
independent of the spatial separation between the three measurements. 
Most interestingly, if one looks at the relations predicted by the GHZ 
state (1.14) between the three measurements after passing the phase shifters 
and the Hadamard transforms, a number of perfect correlations still result 
for certain joint settings of the three parameters [14], the interesting property 
now being that it is not possible to understand even the perfect correlations 
with a local modeL This shows that quantum mechanics is at variance with

a classical local world view not only for the sector of statistical predictions 
of the theory but also for predictions which can be made with certainty. 
1.5 Entanglement and Quantum Indistinguishability 
In order to understand both the nature of entanglement and ways of pro-
ducing it, one has to realise that in states of the general form (l.13) and 
(l.14), we have a superposition between product states. We recall from the 
discussion of the double-slit diffraction phenomenon (Sect. l.1) that super-
position means that there is no way to tell which of the two possibilities 
forming the superposition actually pertains. This rule must also be applied 
to the understanding of quantum entanglement. For example, in the state 
(l.15 ) 
there is no way of telling whether qubit 1 carries the value "0" or "1", and 
likewise whether qubit 2 carries the value "0" or "1". Yet, if one qubit is 
measured the other one immediately assumes a well-defined quantum state. 
These observations lead us directly to the conditions of how to produce and 
observe entangled quantum states. 
To produce entangled quantum states, one has various possibilities. 
Firstly, one can create a source which, through its physical construction, 
is such that the quantum states emerging already have the indistinguishabil-
ity feature discussed above. This is realised, for example, by the decay of a 
spin-O particle into two spin-l/2 particles under conservation of the internal 

10 
1. Basic Concepts 
angular momentum [15]. In this case, the two spins of the emerging particles 
have to be opposite, and, if no further mechanisms exist which permit us to 
distinguish the possibilities right at the source, the emerging quantum state 
is 
(1.16) 
where, e.g. I th means particle 1 with spin up. The state (1.16) has the 
remarkable property that it is rotationally invariant, i.e., the two spins are 
anti-parallel along whichever direction we choose to measure. 
A second possibility is that a source might actually produce quantum 
states of the form of the individual components in the superposition of (1.15), 
but the states might still be distinguishable in some way. This happens, for 
example, in type-II parametric down-conversion [16] (Sect. 3.4.4), where along 
a certain chosen direction the two emerging photon states are 
(1.17) 
That means that either photon 1 is horizontally polarised and photon 2 is 
vertically polarised, or photon 1 is vertically polarised and photon 2 is hor-
izontally polarised. Yet because of the different speeds of light for the H 
and V polarised photons inside the down-conversion crystal, the time corre-
lation between the two photons is different in the two cases. Therefore, the 
two terms in (1.17) can be distinguished by a time measurement and no e~ 
tangled state results because of this potential to distinguish the two cases. 
However, in this case too one can still produce entanglement by shifting the 
two photon-wave packets after their production relative to each other such 
that they become indistinguishable on the basis of their positions in time. 
What this means is the application of a quantum eraser technique [17] where 
a marker, in this case the relative time ordering, is erased such that we obtain 
quantum indistinguishability resulting in the state 
(1.18) 
which is entangled. 
A third means of producing entangled states is to project a non-entangled 
state onto an entangled one. We remark, for example, that an entangled state 
is never orthogonal to any of its components. Specifically, consider a source 
producing the non-entangled state 
(1.19) 
Suppose this state is now sent through a filter described by the projection 
operator 
(1.20) 

1.6 The Controlled NOT Gate 
11 
where Illih2 is the state of (1.15). Then the following entangled state results: 
1 
1 
2(IOhI1}2 + 11hIO}2)((%(112 + (111(OI2)IOhI1}2 = 2(IOhl l h + 11hIOh); 
(1.21) 
it is no longer normalised to unity because the projection procedure implies 
a loss of qubits. 
While each of the three methods discussed above can in principle be used 
to produce outgoing entangled states, a further possibility exists to produce 
entanglement upon observation of a state. In general, this means that we 
have an unentangled or partially entangled state of some form and the mea-
surement procedure itself is such that it projects onto an entangled state, in 
much the same way as discussed just above. This procedure was used, for 
example, in the first experimental demonstration of GHZ entanglement of 
three photons (see Sect. 6.3) [18]. 
1.6 The Controlled NOT Gate 
Thus far, we have discussed only single-qubit gates, that is, gates which 
involve one qubit only. Of greatest importance for quantum computation ap-
plications are two-qubit gates, where the evolution of one qubit is conditional 
upon the state of the other qubit. The simplest of these qates is the quantum 
controlled NOT gate illustrated in Fig. 1.7. The essence of the controlled 
NOT gate is that the value of the so-called target qubit is negated if and 
only if the control qubit has the logical value "1". The logical value of the 
control qubit does not change. The action of the quantum controlled NOT 
gate can be described by the transformations 
IO}cIO}t --+ IO}cIO}t 
11}cIO}t --+ 11}cI1}t 
IO}cI1}t --+ IO}cI1}t 
11}cI1}t --+ 11}cIO}t 
(1.22) 
where IO}c and 11}c refer to the control qubit and IO}t and 11}t refer to the 
target qubit. Together with the single-qubit transformations described in 
I a)

I a + b ) 
Fig. 1.7. The controlled NOT gate is a transformation involving two qubits. The 
value of the control qubit (the upper one in the figure) influences the lower one, 
whose value is flipped if the upper qubit carries "1", and not flipped if the upper 
qubit carries "0". This is equivalent to addition modulo 2. 

12 
1. Basic Concepts 
Sect. 1.3 the quantum controlled NOT gate can be used to realise quantum 
computation networks. One interesting explicit application is the production 
of two-qubit or multi-qubit entangled states using these gates [19J. 
1.7 The EPR Argument and Bell's Inequality 
Immediately after the discovery of modern quantum mechanics, it was re-
alised that it contains novel, counterintuitive features, as witnessed most 
remarkably in the famous dialogue between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein 
[20J. While Einstein initially tried to argue that quantum mechanics is in-
consistent, he later reformulated his argument towards demonstrating that 
quantum mechanics is incomplete. In the seminal paper [21], Einstein, Podol-
sky and Rosen (EPR) consider quantum systems consisting of two particles 
such that, while neither position nor momentum of either particle is well 
defined, the sum of their positions, that is their centre of mass, and the dif-
ference of their momenta, that is their individual momenta in the center of 
mass system, are both precisely defined. It then follows that a measurement 
of either position or momentum performed on, say, particle 1 immediately 
implies a precise position or momentum, respectively, for particle 2, without 
interacting with that particle. Assuming that the two particles can be sepa-
rated by arbitrary distances, EPR suggest that a measurement on particle 1 
cannot have any actual influence on particle 2 (locality condition); thus the 
property of particle 2 must be independent of the measurement performed 
on particle 1. To them, it then follows that both position and momentum can 
simultaneously be well defined properties of a quantum system. 
In his famous reply [22J, Niels Bohr argues that the two particles in the 
EPR case are always parts of one quantum system and thus measurement on 
one particle changes the possible predictions that can be made for the whole 
system and therefore for the other particle. 
While the EPR-Bohr discussion was considered for a long time to be 
merely philosophical, in 1951 David Bohm [15J introduced spin-entangled 
systems and in 1964 John Bell [23J showed that, for such entangled systems, 
measurements of correlated quantities should yield different results in the 
quantum mechanical case to those expected if one assumes that the prop-
erties of the system measured are present prior to, and independent of, the 
observation. Even though a number of experiments have now confirmed the 
quantum predictions [24J-[26J, from a strictly logical point of view the prob-
lem is not closed yet as some loopholes in the existing experiments still make 
it logically possible, at least in principle, to uphold a local realist world view 
[27J. 
Let us briefly present the line of reasoning that leads to an inequality 
equivalent to the original Bell inequality. Consider a source emitting two 
qubits (Fig. 1.8) in the entangled state 

1.7 The EPR Argument and Bell's Inequality 
13 
Fig. 1.8. Correlation measurements between Alice's and Bob's detection events for 
different choices for the detection bases (indicated by the angles a and (3 for the 
orientation of their polarising beamsplitters, PBS) lead to the violation of Bell's 
inequalities. 
1<l>+h2 = ~(IHhIH)2 + IVhlV)2). 
(1.23) 
One qubit is sent to Alice (to the left in Fig. 1.8), the other one to Bob (to 
the right). Alice and Bob will perform polarisation measurements using a 
polarising beamsplitter with two single-photon detectors in the output ports. 
Alice will obtain the measurement result "0" or "1", corresponding to the de-
tection of a qubit by detector 1 or 2 respectively, each with equal probability. 
This statement is valid in whatever polarisation basis she decides to perform 
the measurement, the actual results being completely random. Yet, if Bob 
chooses the same basis, he will always obtain the same result. Thus, following 
the first step of the EPR reasoning, Alice can predict with certainty what 
Bob's result will be. The second step employs the locality hypothesis, that 
is, the assumption that no physical influence can instantly go from Alice's 
apparatus to Bob's and therefore Bob's measured result should only depend 
on the properties of his qubit and on the apparatus he chose. Combining 
the two steps, John Bell investigated possible correlations for the case that 
Alice and Bob choose detection bases which are at oblique angles. For three 
arbitrary angular orientations a, (3, ,,(, one can see [28] that the following 
inequality must be fulfilled: 
(1.24) 
where 
(1.25) 
is the quantum-mechanical prediction for the number of cases where Alice 
obtains "I" with her apparatus at orientation a and Bob achieves "I" with 
orientation (3, and No is the number of pairs emitted by the source. The 
inequality is violated by the quantum-mechanical prediction if we choose, for 
example, the angles (a - (3) = ((3 - "() = 30°. The violation implies that 
at least one of the assumptions entering Bell's inequality must be in conflict 
with quantum mechanics. This is usually viewed as evidence for non-locality, 
though that is by no means the only possible explanation.

1. Basic Concepts 
1.8 Comments 
As recently as a decade ago, the issues discussed here were mainly considered 
to be of a philosophical nature, though very relevant ones in our attempts 
to understand the world around us and our role in it. In the last few years, 
very much to the surprise of most of the early researchers in the field, the 
basic concepts of superposition and quantum entanglement have turned out 
to be key ingredients in novel quantum communication and quantum com-
putation schemes. Here we have given only a condensed introduction. More 
details are contained in the various chapters of this book. Further informa-
tion can also be found on the world wide web, for example at www.qubit.org 
or www.quantum.at with many links to other relevant sites.

2.1 What is Wrong with Classical Cryptography? 
2.1.1 From SCYTALE to ENIGMA 
Human desire to communicate secretly is at least as old as writing itself 
and goes back to the beginnings of our civilisation. Methods of secret com-
munication were developed by many ancient societies, including those of 
Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China, but details regarding the origins of 
cryptologyl remain unknown [29]. 
We know that it was the Spartans, the most warlike of the Greeks, who 
pioneered military cryptography in Europe. Around 400 BC they employed 
a device known as the SCYTALE. The device, used for communication be-
tween military commanders, consisted of a tapered baton around which was 
wrapped a spiral strip of parchment or leather containing the message. Words 
were then written lengthwise along the baton, one letter on each revolution 
of the strip. When unwrapped, the letters of the message appeared scrambled 
and the parchment was sent on its way. The receiver wrapped the parchment 
around another baton of the same shape and the original message reappeared 
as shown in Fig. 2.l. 
Julius Caesar allegedly used, in his correspondence, a simple letter sub-
stitution method. Each letter of Caesar's message was replaced by the letter 
that followed it alphabetically by three places. The letter A was replaced by 
D, the letter B by E, and so on. For example, the English word COLD after 
the Caesar substitution appears as FROG. This method is still called the 
Caesar cipher, regardless the size of the shift used for the substitution. 
These two simple examples already contain the two basic methods of 
encryption which are still employed by cryptographers today namely trans-
positzon and substitution. In transposition (e.g. scytale) the letters of the

hidden and logos word. Cryptology embodies cryptography, the art of code-
making, and cryptanalysis, the art of code-breaking.

plaintext, the technical term for the message to be transmitted, are rear-
ranged by a special permutation. In substitution (e.g. Caesar's cipher) the 
letters of the plaintext are replaced by other letters, numbers or arbitrary 
symbols. In general the two techniques can be combined. 
Until some years ago, sophisticated cryptography was restricted primarily 
to the military world. Only the military had sufficient resources to produce 
sophisticated mechanical devices, such as the famous ENIGMA which was 
widely used by Germans during World War II or its American counterpart 
the M-209. ENIGMA ciphers were broken before the war in Poland and dur-
ing the war at Bletchley Park in England. The Bletchley Park team, which 
included Alan Turing, had to develop the electromechanical tools to break 
these ciphers, which resulted in building the first digital computer called 
COLOSSUS. Thus modern cryptology (for an introduction see, for exam-
ple, [30l~[32]) was born together with computer science. As expressed by R.L. 
Rivest (codiscoverer of the popular RSA public key system), cryptanalysis 
was "the midwife of computer science" . 
2.1.2 Keys and Their Distribution 
Originally the security of a cryptotext depended on the secrecy of the en-
tire encrypting and decrypting procedures; however, today we use ciphers for 
which the algorithm for encrypting and decrypting could be revealed to any-
body without compromising the security of a particular cryptogram. In such 
ciphers a set of specific parameters, called a key, is supplied together with 

2.1 What is Wrong with Classical Cryptography?

the plaintext as an input to the encrypting algorithm, and together with the 
cryptogram as an input to the decrypting algorithm. This can be written as 
EdP) = C, and conversely, Dk(C) = P, 
(2.1) 
where P stands for plaintext, C for cryptotext or cryptogram, k for crypto-
graphic key, and E and D denote an encryption and a decryption operation 
respectively. 
The encrypting and decrypting algorithms are publicly known; the secu-
rity of the cryptogram depends entirely on the secrecy of the key, and this key 
must consist of a randomly chosen, sufficiently long string of bits. Probably 
the best way to explain this procedure is to have a quick look at the Vern am 
cipher, also known as the one-time pad pad.

letters and some punctuation marks, such as

the cryptogram (sequence of digits in the bottom row) we add the plain-
text numbers (the top row of digits) to the key numbers (the middle row), 
which are randomly selected from between 0 and 29, and take the remain-
der after division of the sum by 30, that is we perform addition modulo 30. 
For example, the first letter of the message "s" becomes a number "18"in 
the plaintext, then we add 18 + 15 = 33 ; 33 = 1 x 30 + 3, therefore we 
get 03 in the cryptogram. The encryption and decryption can be written as 
P + k (mod 30) = C and C - k (mod 30) = P respectively. 
The cipher was invented in 1917 by the American AT&T engineer Gilbert 
Vernam. It was later shown, by Claude Shannon [33], that as long as the key 
is trnly random, has the same length as the message, and is never reused 
then the one-time pad is perfectly secure. So, if we have a truly unbreakable 
system, what is wrong with classical cryptography? 
There is a snag. It is called key distnbution. Once the key is established, 
subsequent communication involves sending cryptograms over a channel, even 
one which is vulnerable to total passive eavesdropping (e.g. public announce-
ment in mass-media). This stage is indeed secure. However in order to es-
tablish the key, two users, who share no secret information initially, must at 

18 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
a certain stage of communication use a reliable and a very secure channel. 
Since the interception is a set of measurements performed by an eavesdropper 
on this channel, however difficult this might be from a technological point 
of view, in principle any classical key distribution can always be passively 
monitored, without the legitimate users being aware that any eavesdropping 
has taken place. This would not be such a problem if the key were estab-
lished once and for all. In this case, the users may spend enough resources 
(such as strong safes and protection) to ensure that the key arrives safely to 
its addressee. But since the key has to be renewed for every message, key 
distribution would become prohibitively expensive. For this reason, in most 
applications, one does not require this absolute secrecy, but rather settles for 
less expensive and less secure systems. 
For more mundane transmissions, the system of choice is the Data En-
cryption Standard (DES), which was announced in 1977, and is still in use 
for sensitive but non-secret information, especially for commercial transac-
tions. This system only requires a short key, 64 bits of which 56 bits are used 
directly by the algorithm and 8 bits are used for error detection. It encrypts 
blocks of 64 bits of the plaintext. In the easiest implementation, a long plain-
text is cut into blocks, and the key is then used to encrypt each of them. 
In more sophisticated (and safer) systems, the message is further protected 
by making each enciphered block depend on the previous ones. Frequent ru-
mours that DES has been broken have never been substantiated and it seems 
that DES was designed using excellent criteria; given the short key length it 
is a very good algorithm. Further discussion of the numerous possibilities of 
DES are outside the scope of this review, and can be found in the literature 
or in the internet. As explained above, none of these are totally secure: since 
the same key is used many times, there is information about the plaintext in 
the cryptogram. The goal of the encryption methods is to hide it as well as 
possible. A dedicated cryptanalyst will be able to break the cipher and obtain 
the message, but if it takes too long the information may become obsolete. 
In most applications, it is recommended to use one key for only a few days, 
before discarding it for a new one. Of course, the problem of transmitting 
the key to the receiver remains, but, for all practical purposes, is made less 
critical, as the amount of key required is much smaller. 
Thus a pretty good security is possible, but what about a perfect security? 
It follows from our brief discussion above that in principle we can achieve a 
perfect security in communication via one-time pads provided we solve the 
key distribution problem. The question is: can we solve the key distribution 
problem? The answer to this question is basically "yes". There are two very 
interesting solutions, one mathematical and one physical. The mathematical 
one is known as public-key cryptography and the physical one is referred to 
as quantum cryptography. 

2.1 What is Wrong with Classical Cryptography? 
19 
2.1.3 Public Keys and Quantum Cryptography 
Before we proceed any further let us introduce our three main characters: 
Alice and Bob, two individuals who want to communicate secretly, and Eve, 
an eavesdropper. The scenario is: Alice and Bob want to establish a secret 
key and Eve wants to gain at least partial information about the key. 
Cryptologists have tried hard to give Alice and Bob the edge and to 
solve the key distribution problem. The 1970s, for example, brought a clever 
mathematical discovery in the shape of "public key" systems. The two main 
public key cryptography techniques in use today are the Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange protocol [34] and the RSA encryption system [35]. They were dis-
covered in the academic community in 1976 and 1978, respectively. However, 
these techniques were known to the British government agencies prior to 
these dates, although this was not officially confirmed until recently. In fact 
the techniques were first discovered at CESG in the early 1970s by James 
Ellis, who called them "Non-Secret Encryption". In 1973, building on Ellis' 
idea, C. Cocks designed what we now call RSA, and in 1974 M. Williamson 
proposed what is essentially known today as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange 
protocol.

Fig. 2.2. Public key cryptosystem can be explained using the following mechanical 
analogy. Imagine Bob who can produce many padlocks and anybody who wants to 
send secret messages to Bob can receive an open padlock manufactured by Bob. An 
open padlock can be viewed as a public key. In particular Alice gets one too. Once 
the padlock is locked by Alice only Bob can open it because only Bob has the key 
- the private key. Thus Alice can lock any data she wants to send to Bob with this 
padlock. Once the data is locked, only Bob can access it thanks to his private key. 

20 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
In the public-key systems users do not need to agree on a secret key be-
fore they send the message. They work on the principle of a safe with two 
keys, one public key to lock it, and another private one to open it. Every-
one has a key to lock the safe but only one person has a key that will open 
it again, so anyone can put a message in the safe but only one person can 
take it out. Another analogy is the padlock example shown in Fig. 2.2. These 
systems exploit the fact that certain mathematical operations are easier to 
do in one direction than the other. The systems avoid the key distribution 
problem but unfortunately their security depends on unproven mathematical 
assumptions, such as the difficulty of factoring large integers. That is, it is 
perfectly possible to figure out the private key from the public one but it is 
difficult. For example, RSA - a very popular public key cryptosystem named 
after the three inventors, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [35] 
- gets its security from the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Mathemati-
cians believe (firmly, though they have not actually proved it) that in order 
to factorise a number with N decimal digits, any classical computer needs 
a number of steps that grows exponentially with N: that is to say, adding 
one extra digit to the number to be factorised generally multiplies the time 
required by a fixed factor. Thus, as we increase the number of digits, the task 
rapidly becomes intractable. 
This means that if and when mathematicians or computer scientists come 
up with fast and clever procedures for factoring large integers, the whole 
privacy and discretion of public-key cryptosystems could vanish overnight. 
Indeed, recent work in quantum computation shows that quantum computers 
can, at least in principle, factor much faster than classical computers [36]! 
This means that in one sense public key cryptosystems are already insecure: 
any RSA-encrypted message that is recorded today will become readable 
moments after the first quantum computer is switched on, and therefore 
RSA cannot be used for encrypting any information that will still need to 
be secret on that happy day. Admittedly, that day is probably decades away, 
but can anyone prove, or give any reliable assurance, that it is? Confidence 
in the slowness of technological progress is all that the security of the RSA 
system now rests on. 
Quantum cryptography brings an entirely new way of solving the key dis-
tribution problem. What quantum computation takes away with one hand, 
it returns, at least partially, with the other. One of the simplest types of 
quantum computation ~ a type which is now routinely carried out in the 
laboratory and may soon be a commercial proposition ~ is quantum cryptog-
raphy. It provides perfectly secure key distribution because, unlike all classical 
cryptography, it relies on the laws of physics rather than on ensuring that 
successful eavesdropping would require excessive computational effort. 
Before we discuss quantum cryptography (QC) in detail let us mention 
briefly yet another difficulty in the business of secure communication, namely 
authentication. 

2.1 What is Wrong with Classical Cryptography? 
21 
2.1.4 Authentication: How to Recognise Cinderella? 
So far, we trusted the integrity of the communication channel: we allowed Eve 
to eavesdrop on messages exchanged between Alice and Bob, but we took for 
granted that Eve could not forge or modify them. That is we assumed that 
Alice and Bob have access to a perfect public channel, that is a channel that 
can be freely monitored by anybody; however, it should be impossible to 
modify the information sent through such a channel, e.g., a radio broadcast. 
This may be a risky assumption in many realistic scenarios. In some cases, 
a cunning Eve may interfere in the Alice-Bob communication channel by 
cutting it in two and impersonating Alice to Bob and vice-versa. 
Under this condition, she can, for example, generate two pairs of public-
private keys and give one public key to Alice and one to Bob informing Alice 
that she has been given Bob's public key and informing Bob that he now has 
Alice's public key. Eve keeps the corresponding private keys and from now 
on any subsequent communication between Alice and Bob would be under 
her complete control. 
Likewise, a private key cryptosystem such as the one-time pad is vulner-
able to tampering if the enemy knows the message being sent. Suppose an 
embassy is using the previously described Vernam cipher to communicate 
with its country. If Eve knows exactly the message being sent, such as names 
of some individuals, she could then intercept the encrypted message and pre-
vent it from reaching its destination. Meanwhile, she gets the corresponding 
Vernam key by performing the subtraction modulo 30 of the ciphertext by 
the message. Afterwards she may use this key at her mercy, for interesting 
purposes like disinformation. This example shows that even perfectly secure 
cryptosystems should not be used blindly. 
"Certifying" a public key or "authenticating" a message is a cryptographic 
technique to counter the kind of attacks described above, called man-in-the-
middle or separate worlds attacks. 
Once Alice and Bob truly share a secret key then convenient and efficient 
methods of authentication exist. However, so far there is no convenient way 
to certify a public key. The only reliable way to check a key's authenticity is 
to meet face-to-face with its owner. Unfortunately, quantum key distribution 
does not provide any more convenient ways to authenticate, to counter a man-
in-the-middle attack. Alice and Bob should meet at least once to exchange 
an authentication key2. 
In the following we assume that Alice and Bob do have access to a perfect 
public channel but we will return, very briefly though, to the authentication 
problem. 
2 In both situations, Alice and Bob can rely on a third party, a trusted arbitrator, 
who is in charge of certifying digital keys.

2.2 Quantum Key Distribution 
Let us start our discussion of the quantum key distribution with an overview 
of some general principles. This will be followed by a more detailed description 
and experimental considerations in Sect. 2.6. 
2.2.1 Preliminaria 
Quantum key distribution begins with the transmission of single or entangled 
quanta between Alice and Bob. Eavesdropping, from a physical point of view, 
is based on a set of measurements performed by an eavesdropper on carriers 
of information, in this case on the transmitted quanta. According to the 
rules of quantum mechanics, in general, any measurement performed by Eve 
unavoidably modifies the state of the transmitted quanta and this can be 
discovered by Alice and Bob in a subsequent public communication 3. Thus 
the main ingredients of the quantum key distributing system are: a quantum 
channel for the exchange of quanta and the so-called public channel, which is 
used to test whether or not the transmission through the quantum channel 
is distorted (see Fig. 2.3). Let us repeat that any public channel can be 
freely monitored by anybody; however, it should be impossible to modify the 
information sent through such a channel. 
During the quantum transmission the key is either encoded using a pre-
scribed set of non-orthogonal quantum states of a single particle or is obtained 
from a prescribed set of measurements performed on entangled particles af-
ter the transmission (in this case the key does not even exist during the 
transmission) . 
2.2.2 Security in Non-orthogonal States: No-Cloning Theorem 
The idea of using non-orthogonal quantum states to encode secret informa-
tion is due to Stephen Wiesner who proposed "quantum money" [37] which 
cannot be forged by copying. This is because one cannot clone non-orthogonal 
quantum states (or any unknown quantum state). To see this, consider two 
3 A legitimate question here is: how can we be sure that the rules of quantum 
mechanics are correct? The answer is that quantum mechanics has been tested 
repeatedly to a very high degree of accuracy and it is the best theory we have at 
the moment. It does not make much sense to ask physicists to prove the laws of 
physics in general and of quantum mechanics in particular. Of course, no body of 
experimental evidence confirming quantum mechanics makes it more "correct" 
but one single experiment may refute the theory. The growth of our scientific 
knowledge is based on conjectures and refutations and most likely quantum me-
chanics will eventually be superseded by a new theory but it seems unlikely 
that this new theory will give new results in the present realm of application of 
quantum mechanics. Rather, new effects will be found in extreme situations as 
encountered, for example, in strong gravitational fields.

normalised states 10) and 11) such that (011) i- 0

10) Iblank) I machine) --+ 10) 10) Imachineo) 
11)lblank)lmachine) --+ 11)11)lmachinel) , 
Suppose there exists a 
(2.2) 
(2.3) 
where "blank" is an initial state of a particle which after the operation be-
comes the clone and all the states are properly normalised. This operation 
must be unitary and should preserve the inner product, thus we require 
(011) = (01 1)(011) (machineolmachined , 
(2.4) 
which is only possible when (011) = 0 (the two states are orthogonal) or when 
(011) = 1 (the two states are indistinguishable and therefore cannot be used 
to encode two different bit values), which contradicts our initial assumption. 
Thus if somebody secretly prepares a random sequence of states of the type 
11) 10) 11) 11) ... , where 10) and 11) are chosen randomly, it is impossible to repro-
duce this sequence faithfully. Wiesner's money with such unclonable quantum 
signatures would require storing non-orthogonal quantum states on the ban-
knotes which is way more difficult than sending non-orthogonal quantum 
states from one place to another. That is why Wiesner's idea was adapted 
to the key distribution. Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard proposed to 
use non-orthogonal states of polarised photons to distribute cryptographic 
keys [38]. Any eavesdropper trying to distinguish between nonorthogonal 10) 
and 11) during the quantum transmission has a problem. Suppose Eve pre-
pares her measuring device initially in a normalised state 1m) and wants to 

24 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
tell 10) from 11) without disturbing the two states, i.e., she wants to implement 
the following unitary operation 
10)lm) ~ 10)lmo) 
11)lm) ~ 11)lml)' 
(2.5) 
(2.6) 
The unitarity condition implies (OI1)(mlm) = (Oll)(molml)' i.e., (molml) = 
1, the final state of the measuring device is the same in both cases. The two 
states are not disturbed but Eve gained no information about the encoded 
bit value. A more general measurement (but still not the most general one), 
which disturbs the original states so that 10) ~ 10') and 11) ~ II') is of the 
form 
10) 1m) ~ 10') Imo) 
11)lm) ~ 11')lml). 
(2.7) 
(2.8) 
The unitarity condition gives (011) = (O'11')(molml). The minimum of 
(molml), which corresponds to the situation where Eve has the best chance 
to distinguish the two states, is obtained for (0'11') = 1, i.e., the two states 10) 
and 11) become the same state after the interaction. Although the measure-
ment just described is not the most general one it gives a good illustration of 
the trade-off between the information gained in the measurement and the dis-
turbance of the original states. The key distribution protocol which employs 
this trade-off is described in detail later. 
2.2.3 Security in Entanglement 
The conceptual foundation for entanglement-based quantum cryptography 
is of a different nature and involves the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. 
In 1935 Einstein together with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR) 
published a paper in which they outlined how a "proper" fundamental the-
ory of nature should look [21]. The EPR programme required completeness 
("In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element 
of reality"), locality ("The real factual situation of the system A is indepen-
dent of what is done with the system B, which is spatially separated from 
the former"), and defined the element of physical reality as "If, without in 
any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty the value of a 
physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality correspond-
ing to this physical quantity". EPR then considered a thought experiment 
on two entangled particles which showed that quantum states cannot in all 
situations be complete descriptions of physical reality. The EPR argument, 
as subsequently modified by David Bohm [15], goes as follows. Imagine the 
singlet-spin state of two spin- ~ particles 
I tP) = ~ 
(I t) It) - 1-0 It)) , 
(2.9) 

2.2 Quantum Key Distribution 
25 
where the single particle kets I t) and I +) denote spin up and spin down 
with respect to some chosen direction. This state is spherically symmetric 
and the choice of the direction does not matter. The two particles, which 
we label A and B, are emitted from a source and fly apart. After they are 
sufficiently separated so that they do not interact with each other we can 
predict with certainty the x component of spin of particle A by measuring 
the x component of spin of particle B. This is because the total spin of the 
two particles is zero and the spin components of the two particles must have 
opposite values. The measurement performed on particle B does not disturb 
particle A (by locality) therefore the x component of spin is an element of 
reality according to the EPR criterion. By the same argument and by the 
spherical symmetry of state I 1[/) the y, z, or any other spin components are 
also elements of reality. However, since there is no quantum state of a spin-~ 
particle in which all components of spin have definite values the quantum 
description of reality is not complete. 
The EPR programme asked for a different description of quantum real-
ity but until John Bell's (1964) theorem it was not clear whether such a 
description was possible and if so whether it would lead to different exper-
imental predictions. Bell showed that the EPR propositions about locality, 
reality, and completeness are incompatible with some quantum mechanical 
predictions involving entangled particles [23]. The contradiction is revealed 
by deriving from the EPR programme an experimentally testable inequality 
which is violated by certain quantum mechanical predictions. In Sect. 1.7 a 
brief derivation of the inequality is given. Extension of Bell's original theorem 
by John Clauser and Michael Horne (1974) made experimental tests of the 
EPR programme feasible [39] and quite a few of them have been performed. 
The experiments have supported quantum mechanical predictions. 
What does all this have to do with data security? Surprisingly, a lot! It 
turns out that the very trick used by Bell to test the conceptual foundations 
of quantum theory can protect data transmission from eavesdroppers! Per-
haps it sounds less surprising when one recalls again the EPR definition of an 
element of reality: "If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict 
with certainty the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element 
of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity". If this particu-
lar physical quantity is used to encode binary values of a cryptographic key 
then all an eavesdropper wants is an element of reality corresponding to the 
encoding observable. This way the entanglement-based quantum cryptogra-
phy made a practical use of quantum entanglement and of the Bell theorem, 
showing that a border between blue sky and down-to-earth research is quite 
blurred. The protocol is described in detail later on. 
2.2.4 What About Noisy Quantum Channels? 
Regardless of the type of the quantum transmission, the bottom line is: a 
perfect quantum channel (i.e., a channel with no noise) is secure. Any dis-

26 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
turbance in the channel is the signature that an eavesdropper tried to break 
into the channel. Thus noisy transmissions should be discarded. Unfortu-
nately, quantum channels are very fragile and in practice it is impossible to 
avoid a certain amount of innocent noise due to interaction with the environ-
ment rather than with an eavesdropper. So, instead of discarding any noisy 
transmission, the legitimate users have to find a procedure to extract a secret 
key, even in the presence of some noise. To start with Alice and Bob have 
to estimate how much information may have leaked to an eavesdropper, as a 
function of parameters that they can measure. This amount of information 
could be either acceptable, tolerable, or intolerable. By tolerable we mean 
that by some subsequent procedures such as privacy amplification or quan-
tum privacy amplification (see Sect. 8.4) it can be reduced to any desired 
acceptable level, at the expense of shortening the key. There exists, however, 
a threshold and if too much information has leaked to an eavesdropper no 
further privacy amplification is possible and the transmission should be dis-
carded. The need for more precise security criteria was originally emphasised 
by Huttner and Ekert [40]; since then quantum eavesdropping has evolved 
into a field of its own. 
If the quantum transmission over noisy channels is based on distribut-
ing entangled particles, then the quantum privacy amplification specifies the 
criteria of security, taking into account the most general attack an eaves-
dropper can mount. The quantum privacy amplification transforms partially 
entangled particles (due to eavesdropping or any external disturbance) into 
completely entangled ones and it is known when such a purification of quan-
tum entanglement is possible. However, on the practical side, the technology 
required to perform quantum purification is similar to that required for the 
quantum computer, and is therefore not yet available. 
The literature about security in single particle transmission is consider-
able. At the beginning, only security against so-called "incoherent attacks" ~ 
in which Eve deals with Alice's particles individually ~ were discussed. But 
quantum mechanics allows more general and more powerful attacks, known 
as "coherent attacks", in which Eve is allowed to use a quantum computer. 
Proofs of security against such attacks have been proposed recently. How-
ever, the more powerful the considered attacks are, the more stringent are 
the necessary security conditions. The same applies to the optimisation of 
the entire protocol, which is crucial for practical applications. 
2.2.5 Practicalities 
Quantum Cryptography (QC) is plagues by several other problems. The first 
one, which is common to most implementations, except the ones with entan-
gled pairs of photons (Sect. 2.4), is that we still do not know how to create 
purely single-photon pulses. The usual source of light for QC is merely an 
attenuated laser. For this type of light, the number of photons in the pulse is 
a random variable, with a Poisson distribution. This means that some pulses 

2.3 Quantum Key Distribution with Single Particles 
27 
may contain no photon at all, while others contain 1, 2 or even more photons. 
Pulses with more than one photon per pulse should be avoided, since they 
may leak information to an eavesdropper. In order to make the probability 
of more than one photon per pulse low enough, one needs to use very weak 
pulses, which in turns reduces the signal to noise ratio. The value generally 
adopted is 0.1 photon per pulse on average (this really means that only one 
pulse out of 10 contains a photon), which gives a probability of more than 
one photon of 5 x 10-3 . This still means that 5 % of the usable pulses (with 
at least one photon), contain two or more photons, and could leak informa-
tion to an eavesdropper. Development of a good single photon source seems 
technologically possible, but has not been achieved yet. 
The second, more serious problem for practical applications of QC is that 
a quantum channel cannot be amplified without losing its quantum proper-
ties. Therefore, due to losses in the transmission, QC can operate only over 
limited distances. For all existing systems, which are based on infrared pho-
tons in silica fibres, the minimum loss rate is about 0.2 dB/km. So it seems 
that QC systems with a range of more than 100 km (with losses of 20 dB, 
or a transmission rate of 0.01) are not possible for the foreseeable future. 
Therefore, a transatlantic cable with QC secrecy remains a complete utopia 
for the time being. 
The third problem is that QC is well adapted to point-to-point exchanges, 
but not so well to other types of networks. Recent proposals suggested some 
improvements in this direction [41], but these are still limited to one-to-a-few 
users. QC access for home-to-home transactions is still impractical. However, 
a kind of Local Area Network, with a central broadcasting station (e.g. the 
main branch of a bank) and a number of receivers (e.g. the local branches of 
the bank), is certainly conceivable. 
2.3 Quantum Key Distribution with Single Particles 
2.3.1 Polarised Photons 
Quantum key distribution with polarised photons, as originally proposed by 
C.H. Bennett and G.Brassard [38, 42], employed pulses of green light in 
free space, over a distance of 40 cm, and we shall discuss it in some detail. 
This experiment was obviously not useful for actual key transmission, but 
represented the first experimental steps of QC. The first implementation of 
this particular protocol with optical fibres (over a distance of about 1 km) 
was done at the university of Geneva [43]. Nowadays, distances have reached 
the tens of kilometers range. In this section, we shall present the principles 
of QC with polarised photons, leaving the experimental implementations to 
Sect. 2.6 
Let us consider pulses of polarised light, each pulse containing a single 
photon. We shall begin with polarisation either horizontal or vertical, denoted

Alice 
Bob 
Fig. 2.4. Polarisation scheme: The sender, Alice, sends very weak pulses of po-
larised light to Bob. The polarisation is controlled by a Pockels cell (PCl), which 
enables Alice to choose between the four possible polarisations: 1 t) , 1 ++) , I.)") , 
1 '\.) . On Bob's side, a second Pockels cell (PC2) controls the rotation of the setup: 
0° corresponds to a measurement in basis EB, while 45° corresponds to a measure-
ment in basis 0. The polarisation beamsplitter (PBS) separates the beam into two 
orthogonal components, which are detected by either DO or Dl (the setup chosen 
corresponds to a measurement in EB). 
in the quantum mechanical Dirac notation by 1 ++) and I:t:) respectively. To 
transmit information we need a coding system, say I:t:) codes for 0, while 
1 ++) codes for 1. Using this system, the sender, known as Alice, can send any 
message to the receiver, known as Bob. For example, if Alice sends a series 
of pulses: 1 ++) , I:t:) , 1 ++) , 1 ++) , I:t:) ; the corresponding binary number is 
10110. When she sends either 1 +-t) or I:t:) only, we shall say that Alice sends 
her photons in the EB basis. As the required key needs to be random, Alice will 
send 0 or 1 with equal probability. In order to detect the message, Bob uses a 
Polarisation Beamsplitter (PBS) transmitting the vertical polarisation while 
deflecting the horizontal one. This is followed by single-photon detectors in 
each arm of the set-up, as shown in Fig. 2.4. Detection in detector DO (D1) 
means that Alice sent a 0 (1). In this case, we shall say that Bob detects in 
the EB basis as well. As detectors are not perfect, and also due to possible 
losses in the transmission, both detectors will often fail to register any photon. 
In this case, Bob shall tell Alice that he failed to register anything, and the 
corresponding bit shall be discarded. Therefore, only a fraction of the original 
bits will be actually used, but the remaining ones should be shared by Alice 
and Bob. This system is thus useless for sending a given message, but it 
will be useful to send a cryptographic key, where the only requirements are 
randomness and confidentiality. 
Up to this point, our setup is totally insecure. The eavesdropper, known 
as Eve, could also measure the pulses with a setup similar to Bob's, and 
re-send similar pulses to Bob. Eve would then know all the bits shared by 
Alice and Bob. To obtain confidentiality, Alice adds another random choice: 
she shall now use either the previous horizontal-vertical polarisations (the EB 
basis); or one of the two linear diagonal polarisations, with I.;') denoting a 
o and 1 '\.) denoting a 1. Here again, Alice shall send a 0 or 1 with equal 
probability. This corresponds to the ® basis. By rotating his setup by 45°,

Table 2.1. Example of a polarisation protocol. Alice chooses at random a basis (EEl 
or 0) and a bit value (0 or 1), and sends the corresponding polarisation state to 
Bob. Bob chooses also at random the reception basis, and obtains a given bit. The 
ensemble of these bits is the raw key. Alice and Bob then tell each other the basis 
used over the public channel, and keep only the bits corresponding to the same 
basis. This is the sifted key. They choose at random some of the remaining bits to 
test for Eve, then discard them. In this case, there are no errors, which indicates 
that the transmission is secure. The remaining bits form the shared key.

Bob can also choose to measure in the ® basis. Safety is obtained thanks to a 
fundamental property of quantum mechanics: indeterminism. A single photon 
pulse prepared in the ® basis and measured in the EB basis has probability ~ of 
going towards either detector, DO or Dl. And this choice is purely random: 
there is nothing in the photon to reveal which way it will go. So if Alice 
prepares a photon in, say state I.?) , and Bob (or anybody else) attempts 
to measure it in the EB basis, he may get a count in either detector, DO or 
Dl, with equal probability. Let us emphasise that this does not mean at all 
that half of the photons in a beam of I.?) are polarised vertically and half 
horizontally. This would be inconsistent with the fact that, when Bob uses 
the ® basis, he always gets a o. In fact, the systems behaves as if, when it is 
measured, it chooses randomly which way to go. 
Obviously, the above applies equally well to Eve. As Alice uses either basis 
at random, there is no way for Eve to decide which measurement basis to 
use. Whenever she uses the wrong basis, she gets a random result, which is 
not correlated to Alice's choice. Another important point is that Eve cannot 
know that she got a wrong result: a count in DO may mean that the photon 
was prepared in the l:t) state, but it may also mean that it was in the I.?) 
or in the I1'\.,.) state, and simply "choose" to go towards DO. This is why we 
do need single-photon pulses: a pulse with more than one photon sent in the 
wrong basis may give a count in both DO and D1, thus telling Eve that she 
used the wrong basis. She could then simply discard the transmission, thus 
avoiding creating any error. However, when she receives only one photon, Eve 
has no other choice but to send it on to Bob, in the state that she measured. 
This will unavoidably create errors in the string received by Bob. The above 
eavesdropping strategy, known as the intercept-resend strategy is only one of 
the possibilities available to Eve.

Fig. 2.5. Diagram of single-photon based quantum key distribution protocol 
We now have the basic blocks for the polarisation cryptograpy protocol, 
an example of which is given in Table 2.1. The whole protocol is illustrated 
in Fig. 2.5 and is summarised as follows: 
1. Alice chooses at random both the basis and the polarisation of her single-
photon pulses, and sends them to Bob. 
2. For each pulse, Bob chooses also at random which basis he will use, and 
measures the pulse. He either registers the count in DO or Dl, or fails to 
register anything, due to losses in the detection or in the transmission. 
The ensemble of all the received bits is the raw key. 
3. Bob uses the public channel to tell Alice which photons were registered, 
and which basis was used. Of course, Bob does not tell the result of 
the measurement (count in DO or Dl). Alice answers back by telling 

2.3 Quantum Key Distribution with Single Particles 
31 
which basis she used. Whenever Alice and Bob used the same basis, 
either EB or (>9, they should get perfectly correlated bits. However, due to 
imperfections in the setup, and to a potential eavesdropper, there will be 
some errors. The ensemble of these bits is the sifted key. 
4. To transform their partly corrupted and maybe not entirely secret strings 
into a usable shared and secret key, Alice and Bob now need some pro-
cessing. The processing stage is in fact common to all implementations of 
QC with single particles. The main steps are: to estimate the error rate 
of the transmission; to infer the maximum information that may have 
leaked to an eavesdropper; and then to correct all the errors, while re-
ducing the information potentially available to Eve to any level required. 
The remaining string of bits is the secret key. 
Polarisation schemes are very appealing in free space, where polarisation 
is conserved, but are more complicated to implement in optical fibres, due 
to depolarisation and randomly fluctuating birefringence. Depolarisation is 
not a major problem: its effects can be suppressed by means of a sufficiently 
coherent source. The timescale of the fluctuations of the birefringence in sta-
ble conditions is quite slow (1 hour). However, during an experiment on an 
installed cable, we have also observed much shorter timescales, which ren-
dered transmission impossible. An electronic compensation system, enabling 
continuous tracking and correction of the polarisation is certainly possible, 
but requires an alignment procedure between Alice and Bob. This may make 
the scheme a bit too cumbersome for potential users. 
2.3.2 Phase Encoded Systems 
Instead of relying on polarisation, which is not easy to control in optical fibres, 
one can base a QC system on phase encoding. Originally the phase encoding, 
with optical fibres and the Mach-Zehnder interferometers, was introduced 
in the context of the entanglement-based quantum cryptography [44], but it 
can also be used with the single-particle schemes [45]. The theoretical setup 
is shown in Fig. 2.6. This is an extended Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with 
Alice on the left, and Bob on the right, with two connecting fibres. Both Alice 
and Bob have a phase modulator (PM) on their side to enable the coding and 
decoding. Let us assume for the moment that Bob does not use his PM, and 
that the interferometer is aligned to have a constructive interference in DO, 
and a destructive one on Dl. If Alice uses her PM to get either 0 or 7r phase 
shift (corresponding to bit value 0 and 1), Bob will either get a count in DO 
or in Dl. This is the equivalent of the previous scheme with two polarisations 
only. To obtain confidentiality, we add the random choice of basis. Her~, this 
means that Alice shall choose between four phase shifts: 0, 7r (corresponding 
to the EB basis), and ~, 3; (corresponding to the (>9 basis). On his side, Bob 
will also choose between 0 phase shift, i.e. measuring in the EB basis, and

Alice chooses between four possibilities: 0 or 1(" corresponding to basis $; ~ or 32" 
corresponding to basis 0. Bob chooses between 0 (corresponding to a measurement 
in basis $) and ~ (corresponding to 0). When Alice and Bob use the same basis, a 
count in DO means 0, and a count in Dl means 1. When the two bases are different, 
there are no correlations between the bit sent by Alice and the one received by Bob. 
~ phase shift, i.e. measuring in the 0 basis. This is the equivalent to the 
previous polarisation scheme. 
Unfortunately, keeping the phase difference in such an extended interfer-
ometer (each arm should be about 20 km long) is very difficult. Therefore a 
better practical setup is to collapse the interferometer, as shown in Fig. 2.7. 
One pulse entering Alice's side of the MZ is split into two. The two pulses 
propagating one after the other along the single transmission fibre are de-
noted by 8 (for short path) and L (for long path). After travelling through 
Bob's side of the MZ, these create three output pulses. Two of them, noted 88 
(for short-short) and LL (for long-long) are not relevant, as they show nO in-
terference effect. The central one however corresponds to two possible paths: 
8L or L8, which are indistinguishable and therefore interfere. The choice of 
the phase shifts by Alice and Bob gives the encoding-decoding, as in the pre-
vious paragraph. This setup is much more stable than the previous one, since

the pulses actually follow the same path for most of the interferometer. The 
drawback is that we lose half of the signal in the two SS and LL paths. 
The scheme proposed by C. Bennett [45], used only two phases for Alice. 
We refer the reader to the original article for a detailed explanation. The 
main advantage of this type of systems is that, in principle, it does not 
require polarisation control. In practice, however, due to some polarisation 
dependence in the components, it seems preferable to control the polarisation. 
Moreover, these schemes still need careful path length adjustment and control 
between the two sides of the interferometer. 
2.4 Quantum Key Distribution with Entangled States 
2.4.1 Transmission of the Raw Key 
The key distribution is performed via a quantum channel which consists of a 
source that emits pairs of photons in the singlet state of polarisations: 
1 
I1/;) = y'2 (It)I+-+) -I+-+)It)) 
(2.10) 
The photons fly apart along the z-axis towards the two legitimate users of 
the channel, Alice and Bob, who, after the photons have separated, perform 
measurements and register the outcome of the measurements in one of three 
bases, obtained by rotating the EB basis around the z-axis by angles ¢~ =

Superscripts "a" and "b" refer to Alice's and Bob's analysers respectively. 
The users choose their bases randomly and independently for each pair of 
the incoming particles. Each measurement yield two possible results, + 1 (the 
photon is measured in the first polarisation state of the chosen basis) and -1 
(it is measured in the other polarisation state of the chosen basis), and can 
potentially reveal one bit of information. 
The quantity 
E(¢~, ¢~) = p++(¢~, ¢~) + P __ (¢~, ¢~) -
p+_(¢~, ¢~) -
p_+(¢~, ¢~) 
(2.11) 
is the correlation coefficient of the measurements performed by Alice in the 
basis rotated by ¢~ and by Bob in the basis rotated by ¢~. Here P ±± (¢~ , ¢~) 
denotes the probability that the result ±1 has been obtained in the basis 
defined by ¢~ and ±1 in the basis defined by ¢~. According to the quantum 
rules 
E(¢~, ¢~) = - cos [2(¢~ -
¢~)l. 
(2.12) 

34 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
For the two pairs of bases of the same orientation (¢~, ¢~ and ¢3' ¢~) quantum 
mechanics predicts total anticorrelation of the results obtained by Alice and 
Bob: E(¢~,¢~) = E(¢3'¢~) =-l. 
One can define the quantity S composed of the correlation coefficients for 
which Alice and Bob used analysers of different orientation 
S = E(¢f, ¢~) + E(¢~, ¢~) + E(¢~, ¢~) -
E(¢~, ¢~). 
(2.13) 
This is the same S as in the generalised Bell theorem proposed by Clauser, 
Horne, Shimony, and Holt, and known as the CHSH inequality [12]. Quantum 
mechanics requires 
S = -2\1"2. 
(2.14) 
After the transmission has taken place, Alice and Bob can announce in 
public the orientations of the analysers they have chosen for each particular 
measurement and divide the measurements into two separate groups: a first 
group for which they used different orientation of the analysers, and a sec-
ond group for which they used the same orientation of the analysers. They 
discard all measurements in which either or both of them failed to register 
a particle at all. Subsequently Alice and Bob can reveal publicly the results 
they obtained but within the first group of measurements only. This allows 
them to establish the value of S, which if the particles were not directly or 
indirectly "disturbed" should reproduce the result of (2.14). This assures the 
legitimate users that the results they obtained within the second group of 
measurements are anticorrelated and can be converted into a secret string of 
bits -
the key. 
An eavesdropper, Eve, cannot elicit any information from the particles 
while in transit from the source to the legitimate users, simply because there 
is no information encoded there! The information "comes into being" only 
after the legitimate users perform measurements and communicate in public 
afterwards. Eve may try to substitute her own prepared data for Alice and 
Bob to misguide them, but as she does not know which orientation of the 
analysers will be chosen for a given pair of particles there is no good strategy 
to escape being detected. In this case her intervention will be equivalent to 
introducing elements of physical reality to the polarisation directions and will 
lower S below its 'quantum' value. Thus the Bell theorem can indeed expose 
eavesdroppers. 
2.4.2 Security Criteria 
The best way to analyse eavesdropping in the system is to adopt the scenario 
that is most favourable for eavesdropping, namely where Eve herself is allowed 
to prepare all the pairs that Alice and Bob will subsequently use to establish 
a key. This way we take the most conservative view which attributes all 

2.4 Quantum Key Distribution with Entangled States 
35 
disturbance in the channel to eavesdropping even though most of it (if not 
all) may be due to an innocent environmental noise. 
Let us start our analysis of eavesdropping in the spirit of the Bell theorem 
and consider a simple case in which Eve knows precisely which particle is in 
which state. Following [46] let us assume that Eve prepares each particle in 
the EPR pairs separately so that each individual particle in the pair has a 
well defined polarisation in some direction. These directions may vary from 
pair to pair so we can say that she prepares with probability P(()a, ()b) Alice's 
particle in state I ()a) and Bob's particle in state I ()b), where ()a and ()b are two 
angles measured from the vertical axis describing the polarisations. This kind 
of preparation gives Eve total control over the state of individual particles. 
This is the case where Eve will always have the edge and Alice and Bob 
should abandon establishing the key; they will learn about it by estimating 
181 which in this case will always be smaller than J2. To see this let us write 
the density operator for each pair as 
(2.15) 
Equation (2.13) with appropriately modified correlation coefficients reads 
1
1</2 
8 = 
P(()a, ()b)d()ad()b { cos[2(4)~ - ()a)] cos[2(4)~ - ()b)] 
-1</2 
+ cos[2(4)~ - ()a)] cos[2(4)~ - ()b)] 
+ cos[2(4)~ - ()a)] cos[2(4)~ - ()b)] 
-
cos[2(4)~ - ()a)] cos[2(4)~ - ()b)] }, 
(2.16) 
and leads to 
(2.17) 
which implies 
(2.18) 
for any state preparation described by the probability distribution P(()a, ()b). 
Clearly Eve can give up her perfect control of quantum states of individual 
particles in the pairs and entangle at least some of them. If she were to 
prepare all the pairs in perfectly entangled singlet states she would lose all 
her control and knowledge about Alice's and Bob's data who can then easily 
establish a secret key. This case is unrealistic because, in practice, Alice and 
Bob will never register 181 = 2J2. However, if Eve prepares only partially 
entangled pairs then it is still possible for Alice and Bob to establish the key 
with absolute security, provided they use a Quantum Privacy Amplification 
algorithm (QPA) [47]. The case of partially entangled pairs, J2 ~ lSI ~ 2J2, 

36 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
is the most important one and in order to claim that we have an operational 
key distribution scheme we have to prove that the key can be established in 
this particular case. Skipping technical details we will present only the main 
idea behind the QPA; details can be found in [47] and in Sect. 8.4. 
Firstly, note that any two particles that are jointly in a pure state cannot 
be entangled with any third physical object. Therefore, any procedure that 
delivers EPR pairs in pure states must also have eliminated the entanglement 
between any of those pairs and any other system. The QP A scheme is based 
on an iterative quantum algorithm which, if performed with perfect accu-
racy, starting with a collection of EPR-pairs in mixed states, would discard 
some of them and leave the remaining ones in states converging to the pure 
singlet state. If (as must be the case realistically) the algorithm is performed 
imperfectly, the density operator of the pairs remaining after each iteration 
will not converge on the singlet but on a state close to it; however, the degree 
of entanglement with any eavesdropper will nevertheless continue to fall, and 
can be brought to an arbitrary low value. The QPA can be performed by 
Alice and Bob at distant locations by a sequence of local unitary operations 
and measurements which are agreed upon by communication over a public 
channel and could be implemented using technology that is currently being 
developed (c.f. [48]). 
The essential element of the QPA procedure is the "entanglement pu-
rification" scheme [49] (see Chap. 8). It has been shown recently that any 
partially entangled states of two-state particles can be purified [50]. Thus, 
as long as the density operator cannot be written as a mixture of product 
states, i.e., is not of the form (2.15), then Alice and Bob can outsmart Eve! 
2.5 Quantum Eavesdropping 
The QPA procedure requires technology which is not quite available today. 
Therefore, let us discuss techniques which are much closer to experimen-
tal implementations. They are important because we want to build the key 
distribution prototypes with the current technology and we need to specify 
the conditions under which they are really secure. Our discussion below is 
of a general nature and can be applied both to the single-particle and the 
entanglement-based key distribution. Our description, however, for purely 
pedagogical reasons, assumes the single-particle scheme where Alice sends 
photons to Bob. 
2.5.1 Error Correction 
Since it is essential that Alice and Bob share an identical string of bits, they 
must correct the discrepancies in their sifted keys. This step, called reconcil-
iation or error correction may use the public channel, but it should disclose 

2.5 Quantum Eavesdropping 
37 
as little information as possible to Eve about the reconciled key (or use as 
few private bits as possible if they decide to encrypt the critical part of their 
public communication with a previously shared private key). The minimum 
number r of bits that Alice and Bob have to exchange publicly to correct 
their data is given by Shannon's Coding theorem [32]: In our case, in which 
each bit is transmitted incorrectly with an error probability E independently 
for each bit transmitted, the theorem asserts that 
r=n(-dog2 E-(1-E)log2(1-E)) , 
where n is the length of the sifted key. 
(2.19) 
Shannon's theorem has a non-constructive proof, which means that we 
know there exists a correction scheme disclosing only r bits of private data, 
but the theorem does not provide an explicit procedure. The usual linear 
error-correcting codes turn out to be rather inefficient in this regard. However, 
Brassard and Salvail [51] devised a practical interactive correction scheme 
that gets close to Shannon's limit. The scheme works as follows: 
Alice and Bob group their bits into blocks of a given size, which has to be 
optimised as a function of the error rate. They exchange information about 
the parity of each block over the public channel. If their parities agree then 
they proceed to the next block. If their parities disagree, they deduce that 
there was an odd number of errors in the corresponding block, and search one 
of them recursively by cutting the block into two sub-blocks and comparing 
the parities of the first sub-block: if the parities agree then the second sub-
block has an odd number of errors and if they do not, then the first sub-block 
has an odd number of errors. This procedure is continued recursively on the 
sub block with an odd number of errors. 
After this first step, every considered block has either an even number 
of errors or none. Alice and Bob then shuffle the positions of their bits and 
repeat the same procedure with blocks of bigger size (this size being optimised 
as well). However, when an error is corrected, Alice and Bob might deduce 
that some blocks treated previously now have an odd number of errors. They 
choose the smallest block amongst them and correct one error recursively, as 
before. They proceed until every previously treated block has an even number 
of errors, or none. 
Similar steps follow, and the interactive error correction terminates after 
a specified number of steps. This number is to be optimised in order to max-
imise the probability that no discrepancies remain and, at the same time, 
minimise the leakage of private data. Unlike the correction scheme used orig-
inally in [42], this correction scheme does not discard any bit from the sifted 
key. 
2.5.2 Privacy Amplification 
At this point Alice and Bob share, with high probability, an identical rec-
onciled key. They also know the exact error rate E, which gives a very good 

38 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
estimation of the error probability E. Alice and Bob assume that all the errors 
were caused by the potential eavesdropper, Eve. They also take into account 
the leakage during the error correction step, if any. Then they deduce T, the 
number of bits by which the reconciled key has to be shortened so that Eve's 
information about the final key is lower than a specified value. More precisely, 
in most quantum key distribution protocols, given the integer T, Alice picks 
randomly a (n - T) X n binary matrix K (a matrix whose entries are 0 or 1) 
and publicly transmits K to Bob (without encrypting it). The final private 
key is then: 
kfinal = K . kreconciled 
( mod 2) 
(2.20) 
where kreconciled = (kl' k2' ... ,kn ), k, E {O, 1 }, is the reconciled key. 
Implementation of privacy amplification is easy, but proving security of 
the entire quantum key distribution protocol is a hard theoretical task in 
quantum cryptography. Therefore, proofs of security have been proposed 
gradually, against more and more powerful attacks. Usually we divide those 
attacks in two categories: 
1. Incoherent attacks (Fig. 2.8): In incoherent attacks, or individual particle 
attacks, Eve is limited to entangling a quantum probe P, with one photon at 
a time. She may keep P, until the entangled photon is measured by Bob and 
all public discussions between Alice and Bob are completed. Indeed, Alice 
and Bob cannot tell whether Eve measures her probes before or after Bob 
measures his photons. Therefore the best strategy for Eve is to wait until 
measurement bases are announced publicly by Alice and Bob and then clev-
erly measure her probes to extract as much information as possible. However, 
in incoherent attacks, Eve is limited to measuring her probes P, individually. 
In more detail, taking into account the scenario presented in Sect. 2.3.1 
and denoting by I E), the initial state of Eve's probe, the most general unitary 
transformation U entangling P, to Alice's photon reads (in the EB basis): 
I E), It) J!..-r I E~) It) + I E~) IB) 
I E), IB) J!..-r I Efb) It) + I E~D IB) 
(2.21 ) 
(2.22) 
where I E~) are unnormalised states of P,. Since I E), can be chosen to lie 
in the span of {I E~) }" J' we can assume that P, is described with a 4-
dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. each probe is described by 2 qubits. 
The action of U, if Alice sends her photon in the @ basis, is derived from 
(2.21, 2.22) using linearity: 
I E), 1/) J!..-r I E~) 1/) + I E~D I'\.) 
I E), I'\.) J!..-r I E~) 1/) + I E~D 1'\.),

Eve has to choose U so that:

(2.27) 
(2.28) 
1. the eavesdropping is discreet, i.e. for instance, the probability that Bob 
measures I t) while Alice sent I +-+) should be lower than the tolerated 
error rate. We can see that this is equivalent to requiring that the norms 
(E~ I E~) and (E~ I E~), i -=f. j, should be small (those probabilities 
are usually called disturbances). 
2. the eavesdropping is efficient, i.e. Eve should maximise the probability of 
guessing the correct bit value knowing the used basis (she learned from 
the public channel), and measuring her probe accordingly. For instance, 
suppose Eve learns that ith photon was sent in the ED basis. She then 
knows that if Alice's corresponding bit value is 0, then Eve's probe P, 
should be in the mixed state:

(2.29) 
(2.30) 
Likewise, if Alice sent her photon in the 1+-+) state (corresponding to the 
bit value 1), Eve's probe should be in the mixed state: 
PI = Trphoton [(U I E)" I+-+))(U I E), I+-+))t] 
= 
1 E'lb) (E'lb 1 + 1 E~D (E~ I· 
(2.31) 
(2.32) 
Eve's goal is therefore to decide, as reliably as possible, whether her probe 
P, is in the state Po or in the state Pl. It is known [52, 53] that this is 
achieved by performing a measurement on P,. The measured observable 
is determined by its eigenvectors which, in this case, coincide with the 
eigenvectors of Po - Pl. 
The optimisation of this entanglement has been thoroughly discussed in 
Refs. [52]-[56] for various single-photon quantum key distribution protocols. 
Their results link the error probability of the quantum channel (or distur-
bance) to the maximum information Eve could have gained. Knowing this 
value (more precisely, a related value called the Renyi information) the gener-
alised privacy amplification theorem [57] can be used to compute the shrink-
ing parameter T which guarantees expected confidentiality. The leakage of 
information is considered tolerable if T is reasonably small compared to the 
size of the reconciled key. 
2. Coherent attacks (Fig. 2.9): In coherent or joint attacks, Eve can en-
tangle in any unitary manner a probe of any dimension and in any state 
(mixed or not) with the whole sequence of transmitted photons. She keeps 
this big probe until public discussions are over and then performs the most 
general measurement of her choice. The most general class of measurements 
is known as positive operator valued measures (POVM), for more details see 
for example [58]. 
Collective attacks (Fig. 2.10) form a subclass of the coherent attacks where 
Alice's photon i is entangled individually to a separate probe P,. Therefore, 
Eve gets the probes in the same states as in incoherent attacks. However, 
after public discussions are completed, Eve is allowed to carry out any POVM 
on all the probes considered as a single big quantum system. Note that in a 
collective attack, before this POVM, the individual probes P, are unentangled 
and independent of each other. Claims of security against coherent attacks 
are difficult to prove. So far, only protocols using linear error correcting codes 
rather than interactive error correction have been considered. Proof of the 
security of such protocols against collective attacks can be found in [59], and 
against general coherent attacks in [60]. 
Authentication: As we mentioned earlier, Alice and Bob should authenti-
cate their communication in order to counter a possible man-in-the-middle

attack. They should also ensure that they effectively share a new private key. 
Fortunately, there exist classical cryptographic techniques to achieve these 
tasks with arbitrarily high probability. We provide a concise description of 
an authentication algorithm and refer the reader to [61] for further details. 
General discussion about authentication can be found in [30]. 
We assumed that Alice and Bob shared an authentication key A which is 
a secret string of binary digits. This key is shorter than the new private key 
generated by quantum key distribution, but we assume that it is long enough 
for authentication purposes. 
An integer t is chosen; it is a security parameter. Suppose Alice wants 
to authenticate the data Mo to Bob. The binary string Mo contains, for 
instance, predefined parts of their public discussions. The string Mo, of length 
m, is then broken into sub-blocks Pt of length 25 where 5 = t + log2log2 m 
(the last sub-block is padded with zeros if necessary). Alice and Bob take 
the first 25 bits of A to define a number a. The next 25 bits of A define a 
number b. These 45 bits are discarded from A. Then they compute, for each 
sub-block P" 
p; = ap, + b 
(mod2S), 
(2.33) 
where p, is the number represented by the binary string P,. 
The resulting numbers p; are converted into bit-streams of length 5 and 
concatenated to form MI. The same operation is repeated (5 remains un-
changed) r times until the length of Mr is 5. The low-order t bits of Mr 
constitute the tag T. The used part of A is discarded and never reused.

Fig. 2.10. Collective attacks: similar to incoherent attacks, but Eve is now al-
lowed to make global generalised measurement on all probes considered as a single 
quantum system. 
Finally the tag T is sent to Bob, who checks the authenticity of Mo by 
doing the same calculations and comparing their results. 
The authentication in the quantum key distribution protocol could be 
implemented as follows. Alice authenticates predefined parts of the public 
communication. Bob does the same, but with other predefined parts. If this 
authentication succeeds, the quantum key distribution is considered to be 
successful and a small part of the new private key can be used as an authen-
tication key for a next session of key distribution. This way, Alice and Bob 
do not need to meet again to share another authentication key. Suppose a 
man-in-the-middle attack was performed by Eve. Eve shares a private key 
with Alice, and another private key with Bob. She knows the data Mo au-
thenticated by Alice, since Eve was impersonating Bob to Alice during the 
whole protocol. However, receiving T and knowing M o, it can be shown that 
Eve has negligible probability of guessing the authentication key. Therefore, 
Eve will not be able to pass the authentication test. 

2.6 Experimental Realisations

2.6 Experimental Realisations 
After the first proof-of-the-principle experiments by the IBM-Montreal group 
[42] (key distribution using polarised photons and free space propagation) 
and the Oxford-DERA group [44] (entangled photons, propagation in optical 
fibres, phase encoding) the development of quantum cryptography has con-
tinued in two distinct directions: On the one hand it aims to optimise the 
systems with respect to transmission length, key generation rate and quantum 
bit error rate (QBER), but on the other hand efforts are simultaneously made 
to make the systems more stable and easier to use for some potential end-user 
interested in secure communication, rather than in quantum mechanics and 
optical alignment. As shown in the previous sections, the general idea behind 
the various implementations is similar, except for the EPR-based schemes, 
differing mainly in the type of modulation or analysis used. In the following 
we describe some of the key developments that constitute the current state 
of the art in quantum cryptography. 
Besides achieving a maximum of reliability for the transmitter and re-
ceiver modules of Alice and Bob, a key issue is to increase the transmission 
length. Generally, there are two ways: the first is to establish direct free opti-
cal path between Alice and Bob and to transmit the light through free space 
by using telescopes. The other approach uses optical fibres to guide the light 
between the two points. The choice of the transmission method more or less 
dictates the wavelength used. Optical fibres have very low absorption in the 
so-called telecom windows around 1300nm (0.35 dB/km) and around 1550nm 
(0.2 dB/km). However, for this regime the single photon detectors needed are 
not that well developed yet [62]. Free space cryptography via satellites in near 
earth orbits might bridge arbitrary distances and initial tests on earth indi-
cate that such quantum cryptography transmission is in principle possible, 
at least for low bit rates. 
2.6.1 Polarisation Encoding 
The first quantum cryptography set-up used different polarisation states for 
the key distribution protocol. On a standard optical bench of 1m length, Alice 
first generated the faint light pulses with a simple light emitting diode (LED) 
and passed the collimated light through an interference filter (550±20nm) and 
a polarising filter. Using two Pockels cells, she could set one of four polarisa-
tion directions (here horizontal, vertical, left and right circular). The Pockels 
cell uses the change of the birefringence of certain crystals depending on some 
applied electrical field. Usually one needs quite high voltages, on the order of 
2-4kV, to generate a rotation of the polarisation by 90 0 , say from horizontal 
to vertical. (This limits the switching rate for practical applications.) At the 
end of a quantum channel of 32 cm, Bob could analyse the polarisation in the 
basis set with his Pockels cell by detecting a photon with photomultipliers 
behind a Wollaston prism. 

44 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
Even if, according to the authors, an eavesdropper could have broken 
the system by listening to the noise of the Pockels cell switches, this first 
demonstration experiment already has many of the appealing features of 
quantum cryptography. It was shown from the very beginning how simple 
experimental quantum cryptography can be - and should be, in order to 
increase the usability and acceptance for the quantum communication end-
user. Moreover, an error rate of only "-'4.4% was reached allowing one to 
distribute, after error correction, a key of 219 secure bits within a time of 
85s. 
In order to provide a larger distance between Alice and Bob, a fibre trans-
mission line of 1 km was used in an experiment by Muller et al. [43]. However, 
a fibre based polarisation encoding system has to overcome several drawbacks. 
On the one hand, Bob's analyser has to be kept aligned with respect to the 
polarisation sent by Alice; on the other hand, the polarisation of light will 
be changed when transported along a fibre cable. Due to the geometry of 
the light path, topological effects will influence the resulting polarisation at 
Bob's end of the fibre [63]. Moreover, stress induced birefringence causes both 
fluctuations in the resulting polarisation and a reduction of the polarisation 
due to polarisation-mode dispersion. This necessitates the use of single mode 
lasers to obtain a large enough coherence time and active polarisation stabili-
sation between Alice and Bob. Finally, careful selection of the various optical 
components of the transmitter and receiver modules is necessary to minimise 
any intrinsic polarisation dependence. 
More recently, free space systems have begun to utilise the higher sta-
bility of the polarisation encoding modules. Since atmosphere is essentially 
non-birefringent, one does not have to worry about the fluctuations of the rel-
ative alignment between Alice's and Bob's modules. Quantum cryptography 
over outdoor optical paths [64] mainly faces the problem of transmitting light 
through turbulent media and detecting single photons against a high back-
ground. Combining narrow bandwidth and spatial filtering with nanosecond 
timing should enable key generation with reasonable error rates. A recent ex-
periment in Los Alamos achieved a 14% coupling efficiency over a 950m free 
space path length, resulting in a bit rate of 50Hz (starting with 20kHz pulse 
rate at Alice's transmitter) with an error of about 1.5 [65]. This experiment 
shows the feasibility of establishing a secret key with a low orbit satellite, at 
least at night-time, with reasonable bit rate. 
2.6.2 Phase Encoding 
As pointed out in Sect. 2.3.2 phase encoding can be performed analogously 
to polarisation encoding. The extreme sensitivity to any external influences 
of a Mach-Zehnder set up shown in Fig. 2.6 can be overcome with the un-
balanced Mach-Zehnder configuration proposed by Bennett [45]. Since the 
two coherent contributions are then separated by only a few nanoseconds 
but propagating along the same fibre, there are essentially no temperature or 

2.6 Experimental Realisations 
45 
stress induced fluctuations. The path length difference of Bob's unbalanced 
interferometer has to be the same as in Alice's interferometer and has to be 
kept stable on the sub-wavelength scale. However, this simply requires careful 
local temperature stabilisation of the two interferometers. 
Phase modulators are commercially available for the two telecom wave-
lengths which seemingly makes the standard phase encoding scheme the best 
choice for fibre implementations. However, polarisation also places stringent 
alignment conditions on such a scheme. Of course, in the two unbalanced 
Mach-Zehnder interferometers the polarisation has to be controlled such that 
the interfering components have the same polarisation at Bob's output beam-
splitter. After an initial alignment of Alice' and Bob's modules, this should 
be stable and cause no further trouble. A more severe problem comes from 
the fact that phase modulators are made of electro-optic crystals with pre-
ferred guiding only for one of the two polarisation components. In order to 
avoid intensity fluctuations at Bob's output, only one well defined polarisa-
tion can be sent through the modulators. This in turn again makes control 
of the transmitted polarisation necessary. 
In their experimental realisation Townsend et al. [66] first split the in-
coming laser pulse (l.3 /Jm, 80 ps) along the two paths of Alice's unbalanced 
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In one arm, the phase modulator causes one 
of the four possible phase shifts according to the BB84 protocol. In the other 
arm, the polarisation is rotated such that, at Alice's output beamsplitter, the 
two contributions have orthogonal polarisation. Bob's input beamsplitter is 
replaced by a polarising beamsplitter to ensure correct polarisation in the 
arm going to Bob's phase modulator. A polarisation controller at the end of 
the transmission line is set such that these two polarisation directions agree 
with the axes of Bob's input polarisation splitter. Although polarisation sta-
bilisation becomes necessary again, the specifications are not so strict in such 
a set-up, since small deviations cause only negligible fluctuations in the final 
intensity. Error rates of less than 4% were achieved even for a pulse rate 
of 1 MHz. Further improvements with transmission over 48 km underground 
fibre cable were achieved by the Los Alamos group [67] with about 1% error 
at a pulse rate of 30 kHz. 
No continuous polarisation alignment of the fibre transmission line is nec-
essary for the so called "plug & play" system. The idea behind this is that the 
light pulse is emitted not at Alice's station, but by Bob, then first propagates 
to Alice, where it is modulated and reflected back to Bob. If the reflections in 
this scheme are done by Faraday mirrors, the polarisation of the interfering 
components at Bob's output are always aligned with each other. 
A Faraday mirror, i.e. a 45° Faraday rotator and a back-reflecting mirror, 
render the back reflected light orthogonal to the light sent into the fibre, thus 
any polarisation changes along the transmission line or along the interferom-
eter arms are effectively undone. 

46 
2. Quantum Cryptography 
Fig. 2.11. Principle of plug&play quantum cryptography: Bob sends a light pulse 
through a circulator. This pulse splits at the coupler C1. The first half travels 
through the short arm. A polarisation controller is set so that this pulse is com-
pletely transmitted at the polarising beamsplitter PBS. It then propagates to Alice, 
where it splits again at coupler C2 to provide a timing signal. It then travels through 
Alice's equipment and is reflected back to Bob. Thanks to the Faraday mirror, the 
birefringence of the optical link is compensated, and the pulse comes back orthog-
onally polarised. It is then reflected by the PBS and takes the long arm, where 
Bob applies a phase shift CPB with the modulator PM. The second pulse propagates 
through the two arms in reverse order. Alice applies to it a phase shift CPA. Since 
both pulses travel exactly the same optical path, they reach the coupler C1 simul-
taneously with identical polarisation, giving rise to interference. A storage line SL 
is introduced in Alice's system to avoid problems due to Rayleigh backscaterring. 
The system implementing a 4-state BB84 protocol using this idea is 
depicted in Fig. 2.11 and in [68]. In this experiment Alice and Bob were 
separated by 23 km using standard telecom fibre cable as the transmission 
line. Without any continuous active stabilisation an error as low as 1% was 
achieved while a net key creation rate of 210 Hz was obtained. In all these 
experiments at the telecom wavelengths of 1300 nm most of the noise is due 
to the high dark count rate of the single photon detectors (InGaAs/InP-
avalanche photo-diodes cooled to only 173 K, i.e. within the reach of Peltier 
cooling). Currently, clever timing and gated detection electronics help to re-
duce the noise level, but further improvements of the detectors will tremen-
dously influence the subsequent applicability of quantum cryptography. 
2.6.3 Entanglement-Based Quantum Cryptography 
A number of new features in cryptography become possible when utilising 
the non-classical properties of entangled pairs of particles (see Sect. 2.4). 
However, with the current technology, such schemes are more difficult to 
realise than the single particle approaches described so far, mostly because 
one has to generate a high degree of entanglement. Imperfect entanglement 
between the photons delivered to Alice and Bob could be improved only with 
techniques such as entanglement purification, which are not realisable with 
current technology. Thus any noise in the entanglement directly determines 
the performance of the system. Since the first demonstration [44], the main 

2.7 Concluding Remarks 
47 
goal has thus been to further develop the source of entangled photon pairs. 
Today, parametric down-conversion is used as a source of photon pairs. Due 
to the low efficiency of this process broad band light has to be used to obtain 
a sufficient bit rate. Here a compromise has to be found in order to avoid 
problems when transmitting the photon pairs through dispersive optical fibre. 
Most approaches use the time-energy entanglement (for details see [69, 
70]). If a photon pair is produced by the process of parametric down-
conversion, non-local interference can occur between the outputs of two un-
balanced, but otherwise identical Mach-Zehnder or Michelson interferome-
ters, provided the path length difference of each of the interferometers is 
less than the coherence time of the down-conversion pump laser. In order 
to discriminate between interfering and non-interfering contributions, time 
selection of the detection events is required. The minimum time resolution 
of the single photon detectors of about 300 ps makes a corresponding path 
length difference of about 30 cm necessary. Experiments on the EPR-Bell 
problem performed in Geneva demonstrate that it is possible to distribute 
entangled pairs along standard telecom lines and to observe a high degree of 
entanglement over a physical distance between the detectors of 10 km (the 
actual length of two optical fibres between the source and detectors was 8 km 
and 9km) [71]. 
Polarisation entanglement can be also obtained in the process of para-
metric down-conversion (type II, [16]). In a recent experiment, violation of 
a Bell inequality was observed also for independent observers [72]. In this 
experiment the two observers, Alice and Bob, are separated by about 400 
m (connected by 1 km optical fibre). But here all their measurements, from 
generating a random orientation for analysis until detection of the photon, 
are performed within times (",80 ns) much shorter than the time it takes to 
send information between them ('" 1300 ns). The fast electro-optic modula-
tion system and detection electronics developed for this experiment can be 
directly used to perform quantum cryptography both with true single photon 
states as well as with a violation of a Bell inequality as an assurance of secure 
communication. 
2.7 Concluding Remarks 
Research in quantum cryptography in all its possible variations has become 
very active and any comprehensive review of the field would quickly be over-
taken by events. Hence we have decided to provide here only some very basic 
knowledge, hoping that this will serve as a good starting point for entering 
the field. The basic message is: quantum cryptography today is a viable al-
ternative to conventional methods of encryption and in the not-too-distant 
future we may have to rely on quantum mechanics rather than number theory 
in our confidential communication.

The reader should be warned that we have barely scratched the surface 
of the current activities, neglecting topics such as secure two-party compu-
tation, details of quantum authentication, detailed analysis of eavesdropping 
techniques and security criteria, and some alternative key distribution tech-
niques (e.g. Vaidman and Goldenberg scheme based on sending orthogonal 
states in two parts). Many interesting papers on these and other related 
topics can be found at the Los Alamos National Laboratory e-print archive

3. Quantum Dense Coding 
and Quantum Teleportation 
3.1 Introduction 
D. Bouwmeester, H. Weinfurter, A. Zeilinger 
In Chap. 2 it was shown how quantum entanglement can be used to distribute 
secret keys. In this chapter we will address other primitives of quantum com-
munication employing entanglement. Section 3.2 describes "Quantum Dense 
Coding" which is a way to transmit two bits of information through the 
manipulation of only one of two entangled particles, each of which individu-
ally can carry only 1 bit of information [73]. The "Quantum Teleportation" 
scheme as originally proposed by Bennett, Brassard, Crepeau, Jozsa, Peres, 
and Wootters [74] is explained in Sect. 3.3. The basic idea of quantum tele-
portation is to transfer the state of a quantum system to another quantum 
system at a distant location. 
Quantum optics has proven very successful for the implementation of 
quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation. Two crucial ingredients 
for the optical implementations are the source of entangled photons, described 
in Sect. 3.4, and the Bell-state analyser, described in Sect. 3.5. In Sect. 3.6 
the experimental demonstration of quantum dense coding is presented [75]. 
Section 3.7 describes the quantum teleportation experiment performed in 
Innsbruck [76] in which the polarisation state of a single photon is teleported 
using an auxiliary pair of entangled photons. Section 3.8 describes the exper-
iment, proposed by Popescu [77] and performed in Rome [78], in which the 
polarisation state prepared on one of a pair of momentum entangled photons 
is transferred to its partner at a distant location. Section 3.9 explains the 
teleportation of continuous quantum variables, which was initially proposed 
by Vaidman [79], further elaborated upon by Braunstein and Kimble [80], and 
experimentally demonstrated at Caltech [81]. Each experiment has its own 
advantages and disadvantages and we refer to the literature for a comparison 
between the various methods [82]-[84]. 
If the initial quantum state of the teleportation protocol is part of an en-

referred to as "entanglement swapping", will be described in Sect. 3.10 and 
applications [85J-[87J are presented in Sect. 3.11. 
3.2 Quantum Dense Coding Protocol 
The scheme for quantum dense coding, theoretically proposed by Bennett 
and Wiesner [73J, utilises entanglement between two qubits, each of which 
individually has two orthogonal states, 10) and 11). Classically, there are four 
possible polarisation combinations for a pair of such particles; 00, 01, 10, and 
11. Identifying each combination with different information implies that we 
can encode two bits of information by manipulating both particles. 
Quantum mechanics also allows one to encode the information in super-
positions of the classical combinations. Such superpositions of states of two 
(or more) particles are called entangled states (see Sect. 1.4) and a convenient 
basis in which to represent such states for two particles, labeled 1 and 2, is 
formed by the maximally entangled Bell states 
ItP+h2 = (IOhI1)2 + 11hIO)2)/V2 
ItP-h2 = (IOhI1)2 -11hI0)2)/V2 
1<1>+h2 = (IOhI0)2 + 11hI1)2)/V2 
Icp-h2 = (IOhIOh -11hI1h)/V2· 
(3.1) 
(3.2) 
(3.3) 
(3.4) 
Identifying each Bell state with different information we can again encode two 
bits of information, yet, now by manipulating only one of the two particles. 
This is achieved in the following quantum communication scheme. Ini-
tially, Alice and Bob each obtain one particle of an entangled pair, say, in 
the state ItP+h2 given in (3.1). Bob then performs one out of four possi-
ble unitary transformations on his particle (particle 2) alone. The four such 
transformations are 
1. Identity operation (not changing the original two-particle state ItP+)12) 
2. State exchange (10)2 -t 11)2 and 11)2 -t 10)2, changing the two-particle 
state to 1<1>+)12) 
3 State-dependent phase shift (differing by 7r for 10h and 11)2 and transform-
ing to ItP-)12) 
4. State exchange and phase shift together (giving the state 1<1>-h2). 
Since the four manipulations result in the four orthogonal Bell states, four 
distinguishable messages, i.e. 2 bits of information, can be sent via Bob's 
two-state particle to Alice, who finally reads the encoded information by 
determining the Bell state of the two-particle system. This scheme enhances 
the information capacity of the transmission channel to two bits compared 
to the classical maximum of one bit. 1 
1 While it is clear that this scheme enhances the information capacity of the trans-
mission channel accessed by Bob to two bits, we have to notice that the channel

3.3 Quantum Teleportation Protocol 
In this section we will review the quantum teleportation scheme as proposed 
by Bennett, Brassard, Crepeau, Jozsa, Peres, and Wootters [74]. The scheme 
is illustrated in the Fig. 3.1. 
The idea is that Alice has particle 1 in a certain quantum state, the 
qubit ItJih = alOh + .811h, where 10) and 11) represent two orthogonal states 
with complex amplitudes a and .8 satisfying lal2 + 1.812 = 1. She wishes 
to transfer this quantum state to Bob but suppose she cannot deliver the 
particle directly to him. According to the projection postulate of quantum 
mechanics we know that any quantum measurement performed by Alice on 
her particle will destroy the quantum state at hand without revealing all the 
necessary information for Bob to reconstruct the quantum state. So how can 
she provide Bob with the quantum state? The answer is to use an ancillary 
pair of entangled particles 2 and 3 (EPR pair), where particle 2 is given to 
Alice and particle 3 is given to Bob. Let us consider the case in which the 
entangled pair of particles 2 and 3 shared by Alice and Bob is in the state 
(3.5) 
The important property of this entangled state is that as soon as a measure-
ment on one of the particles projects it onto a certain state, which can be 
any normalised linear superposition of 10) and 11), the other particle has to 
be in the orthogonal state. The specific phase relation between the two terms 
on the right hand side of (3.5) (here the phase difference is 7r, which results 
in the minus sign) implies that the statement of orthogonality is independent 
of the basis chosen for the polarisation measurement. 
Although initially particles 1 and 2 are not entangled, their joint polari-
sation state can always be expressed as a superposition of the four maximally 
entangled Bell states, given by (3.1)-(3.4), since these states form a complete 
orthogonal basis. The total state of the 3 particles can be written as: 
1 
ItJi)123 = ItJih ® ItJi)23 = 2" [ ItJi-h2 (-al0}J - .811)3) 
+ ItJi+h2 (-al0}J + .811)3) 
+ 1(P-h2 (all}J +.810)3) 
+ Ip+h2 (all}J - ,BI0)3 ) ] . 
(3.6) 
Alice now performs a Bell state measurement (BSM) on particles 1 and 2, 
that is, she projects her two particles onto one of the four Bell states. As 
a result of the measurement Bob's particle will be found in a state that is 
directly related to the initial state. For example, if the result of Alice's Bell 
state measurement is Ip-) 12 then particle 3 in the hands of Bob is in the 
carrying the other photon transmits 0 bits of information, thus the total trans-
mitted information does not exceed 2 bits.

Fig. 3.1. Principle of quantum teleportation: Alice has a quantum system, particle 
1, in an initial state which she wants to teleport to Bob. Alice and Bob also share 
an ancillary entangled pair of particles 2 and 3 emitted by an Einstein-Podolsky-
Rosen(EPR) source. Alice then performs a joint Bell state measurement (BSM) on 
the initial particle and one of the ancillaries, projecting them also onto an entangled 
state. After she has sent the result of her measurement as classical information to 
Bob, he can perform a unitary transformation (U) on the other ancillary particle 
resulting in it being in the state of the original particle. In the case of quantum 
teleportation of a qubit, Alice makes a projection measurement onto four orthogonal 
entangled states (the Bell states) that form a complete basis. Sending the outcome 
of her measurement, i.e. two bits of classical information, to Bob will enable Bob 
to reconstruct the initial qubit. 
state all)3 + .810)3. All that Alice has to do is to inform Bob via a classical 
communication channel on her measurement result and Bob can perform the 
appropriate unitary transformation (U) on particle 3 in order to obtain the 
initial state of particle 1. This completes the teleportation protocol. 
Note that, during the teleportation procedure, the values of a and .8 
remain unknown. By her Bell state measurement Alice does not obtain any 
information whatsoever about the teleported state. All that is achieved by 
the Bell state measurement is a transfer of the quantum state. Note also 
that during the Bell state measurement particle 1 loses its initial quantum 
state because it becomes entangled with particle 2. Therefore the state 11Ji) 1 
is destroyed on Alice's side during teleportation, thus obeying the no-cloning 
theorem of quantum mechanics [88] . Furthermore, the initial state of particle 
1 can be completely unknown not only to Alice but to anyone. It could even 
be quantum mechanically completely undefined at the time the Bell state 
measurement takes place. This is the case when, as already remarked by 
Bennett et al. [74], particle 1 itself is a member of an entangled pair and 
therefore has no well-defined properties on its own. This ultimately leads to 
entanglement swapping which will be discussed in Sect . 3.10 [85, 87] . 

3.4 Sources of Entangled Photons 
53 
The experimental implementation of quantum teleportation or of quan-
tum dense coding and entanglement swapping requires the generation of en-
tangled particles and the construction of a Bell state analyser. The following 
two sections describe experimental techniques in quantum optics by which 
entangled photons and a (partial) Bell state analyser can be realised. 
3.4 Sources of Entangled Photons 
N. Gisin, J. G. Rarity, G. Weihs 
There exist several sources of entangled quantum systems. A source of en-
tangled atoms based on cavity quantum electrodynamics will be described in 
Sect. 5.2.3. Entangled ions have been prepared in electromagnetic Paul traps, 
see Sect. 5.2.11. Controlled entanglement between nuclear spins within a sin-
gle molecule can be achieved by the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance 
and is presented in Sect. 5.3. Sources of entanglement in solid state physics 
are also being studied; however, it is still too early to see whether controlled 
entanglement in solid state physics is realisable. Here we will describe the 
sources of entanglement using quantum optics, which have been proven to be 
most successful, up to now, in generating high-quality entanglement. 
In quantum optics there are two classes in which entanglement can be 
established (for a general view on creating entanglement see Sect. 1.5). One 
class is characterised by entanglement between single photons and will be 
described in this section. The other way is to establish entanglement between 
the quadrature components (i.e. the in- and out-of-phase electric-field com-
ponents with respect to a local oscillator) of light beams or between two 
orthogonal polarisation components of light beams (see Sect. 3.9.2). 
3.4.1 Parametric Down-Conversion 
Nonlinear optical processes have been utilised for many experiments in quan-
tum optics. Nonlinear optics is the part of classical electrodynamics which 
deals with strong fields that are scattered inelastically in various media. In-
elastic scattering in the optical domain means that not only the direction but 
also the frequency of light is being changed by the interaction with the ma-
terial, which is described by its electromagnetic susceptibility. During such 
interactions in most cases new fields are created. A power expansion of the 
susceptibility gives the lowest order nonlinear processes; three-wave-mixing 
(parametric interactions) and four-wave-mixing. The individual components 
P, of the electromagnetic polarisation P inside a material are given by 
P, = x~~) E J + x~~£ EJ Ek + X~~£l E J Ek El + ... , 
where the E, are the components of the electric field. 
(3.7) 

54 
3. Quantum Dense Coding and Quantum Teleportation 
In order to be able to observe nonlinear interactions from an interaction 
volume that is large compared to the wavelengths involved, we have to con-
sider contributions from the whole volume. Interference between these con-
tributions leads to the so-called phase-matching relations, which are relations 
between the wavevectors of the respective electromagnetic fields. 
If we look at these processes from a quantum electrodynamical viewpoint, 
we find that there are not only the stimulated but also the spontaneous pro-
cesses just as in the interactions of the electromagnetic field with an atom. 
The spontaneous creation of photons in nonlinear interactions was first in-
vestigated theoretically by Klyshko [89] and experimentally by Burnham and 
Weinberg [90]. A special case of such a process is spontaneous parametric 
down-conversion, a x(2)-nonlinear process, in which only one of the fields is 
initially excited with a frequency wp. Due to the nonlinear interaction and 
this pump field, photons will be created spontaneously in the other two fields 
at frequencies WI and W2. As energy is conserved in the interaction we will 
find that 
Together with the phase-matching condition 
kl +k2 = kp, 
(3.8) 
(3.9) 
this leads to various solutions of the interaction dynamics, depending on the 
material used and on the frequencies that are being observed. The rate of 
conversion is governed by the modulus of the corresponding components of 
X(2) and is in general very low. If, for example, we pump a material with a 
high nonlinearity (e.g. potassium di-deuterium phosphate, ,B-barium borate) 
with 100 m W (UV), we can observe of the order of 1010 photons per second 
of converted light from a small (a few mm long) piece of crystal. Symmetry 
considerations tell us further that x(2Lnonlinearities are only possessed by 
materials which are non-centrosymmetric, a property that belongs only to 
certain crystals. 
In parametric down-conversion in the visible range of the spectrum, we 
distinguish two possible phase-matching schemes. "Type-I" phase-matching 
is the case where the two down-conversion photons have parallel polarisations 
whereas in "type-II" phase-matching they have orthogonal polarisations in 
the basis distinguished by the crystal orientation. It is the simultaneous pro-
duction of the two photons in the conversion process and the phase-matching 
relations, together with proper spatial and temporal selection of the observed 
light, which are responsible for the creation and observation of entanglement. 
3.4.2 Time Entanglement 
There are various properties of photon pairs emerging from a down-conversion 
process that can be correlated. In type-I and type-II down-conversion we can 

3.4 Sources of Entangled Photons 
55 
observe what is sometimes called time entanglement, which only relies on 
fact that the two photons in a pair are created simultaneously and that they 
satisfy the energy conservation rule stated above. This latter criterion means 
that the emission time of any pair is uncertain within the coherence time 
of the pump laser. The simultaneity criterion arises because the individual 
photons of the pair are broadband (nanometre bandwidth) with coherence 
times of order 100 fs. This kind of entanglement has been used for so-called 
two-photon Franson-interferometry (see Fig. 3.2), where both photons pass 
separate unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers [91J. The two interferom-
eters are constructed in the same way and such that the coherence length of 
an individual photon is shorter than the path-length difference. As a result no 
interference can be seen in the direct count rates of detectors at the outputs 
of the interferometers. If, however, we look at the coincidences in the out-
puts of the two interferometers, we will observe oscillations of the coincidence 
count rates as we vary the phases between the arms of the interferometers. 
The state within the interferometers can be represented by 
l!]i) = ~ [ISh ISh + et«hH2)ILhILh 
+etlh ISh ILh + etlP, ILh ISh] , 
(3.10) 
where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the photon moving to the left and to the 
right respectively in Fig. 3.2. State (3.10) is in fact a product state. However 
only long- long (L-L) and short- short (S-S) detections are truly coincident 
at the detectors and other events can be discarded by suitable coincidence 
gating. Initial experiments [91 J did not use this time gating and were limited 
to maximum interference visibility of 50%. Later experiments using narrow 
coincidence gates to post-select only the entangled state show interference 
visibilities greater than 90% [92J. 
An interesting elaboration of time-entanglement should be mentioned. 
One can replace the cw pump laser by a pulsed laser followed by an unbal-
anced interferometer with pulses shorter than the arm length difference of 
the interferometer [93], see Fig. 3.3. Thus, if a pump photon is split into a

twin-photon inside the crystal after the first interferometer, the time of cre-
ation of the latter is undefined. More precisely, the unbalanced interferometer 
transforms the state of the pump photon in a superposition alshort)pump+

state into 
alshort)s 0 Ishort)i + .8llong)s 0 Ilong)i . 
(3.11) 
Contrary to time entangled photons produced with a cw pump laser, the 
coherence of the pulsed pump laser is of no importance, as the necessary co-
herence is built by the unbalanced interferometer. In other words, the uncer-
tainty of the pump photon's arrival time at the crystal (within the coherence 
length of the pump laser) is replaced by the two sharp values corresponding 
to Ishort) and Ilong) which form the basis of our qubit space. Hence, any 
standard laser diode, for instance, can be used as pump. Moreover, the ba-
sic states can be distinguished by their time of arrival, without any optical

Alice and Bob detect photons at 3 different times (relative to the emission time): 
short, medium, long. Short and long counts are 100% correlated. Medium counts 
correspond to the complementary basis, Ishort) ± Ilong), and are also perfectly 
correlated (assuming cp+DA +DB = 0). Note that no random generator is necessary, 
nor any active optical element.

circuit. By varying the coupling ratio and phase of the unbalanced interfer-
ometer, all 2-qubit entangled states can be produced. Hence all of the 2-qubit 
quantum communication protocols can be implemented. 
3.4.3 Momentum Entanglement 
Another kind of entanglement that is present in non-collinear down-conversion 
is momentum entanglement. This is induced by the phase-matching relation 
which governs the emission of different wavelengths into different directions. 
Using apertures A (see Fig. 3.4) two individual mode pairs (directions) from 
the emission of a down-conversion source are selected [94]. The selection is 
such that each pair consists of one photon with colour a (slightly above half 
of the pump frequency) and one photon with colour b (slightly below half 
of the pump frequency). The pairs are emitted into either modes aI, b1 or 
modes a2, b1 as shown in Fig. 3.4. Before the beam-splitter we thus have the 
state 
(3.12) 
which is entangled although the modes at this stage are clearly distinguish-
able. The entanglement manifests itself when the a-modes and b-modes are 
recombined in a beam-splitter. From behind the beamsplitter upper and 
lower paths cannot be distinguished leading to interference. The 50/50 beam-
splitter transforms the incoming fields through

The four terms now show the probability amplitudes for coincident detections 
in each of the four possible detector pairs. Taking the modulus square of 
these amplitudes provides the probability of coincident detections between 
the a- and b-detectors which varies cosinusoidally on changing interferometer 
phase difference <p = <Pa -
<Pb. First order interference effects between the 
combined a- and b-modes are not seen because there is no phase conservation 
for individual photons of each pair. The phase conservation in parametric 
down-conversion arises in the energy conservation stated above; it is the sum 
ofthe phases in the a- and b-modes that are locked to that of the pump beam. 
The a-mode (b-mode) interferometer measures a 'phase' between the two 
possible emissions in a basis fixed by the offset phase <Pa (<Pb). The 100% 
correlation (anticorrelation) in the binary measurement of this phase when-
ever <P = <Pa - <Pb = 0 (7r /2) confirms the non-local nature of the effect. This 
result cannot be reproduced if there is a local realistic phase (satisfying the 
sum phase condition above) associated with each photon pair as it leaves 
the crystal. In the experiment [94J an interference visibility of 82% was mea-
sured, beyond the maximum predicted for any local realistic model of the 
experiment. However the interference visibility is low compared to polarisa-
tion based entanglement experiments due to the difficulties of alignment and 
overlap of the four beams. 
3.4.4 Polarisation Entanglement 
More recently a new type of down-conversion source was found, which relies 
on non-collinear type-II phase matching [16J. At certain angles between the 
pump-beam and the optic axis of the conversion crystal the phase-matching 
conditions will be such that the photons are emitted along cones, which do 
not have a common axis, as is illustrated in Fig. 3.5 and Fig. 3.6. One of the 
cones is ordinarily polarised the other one extraordinarily. These cones will 
in general intersect along two directions. If we now remember that in type-II 
down-conversion the two photons in a pair are always polarised orthogonally, 
we will find that along the two directions of intersection the emitted light 
is unpolarised, because we cannot distinguish whether a certain photon be-
longs to one or the other cone. This is not yet exactly true, because in the 
birefringent crystal the ordinary and extraordinary photons will propagate 
at different velocities and so we could at least in principle distinguish the two 
cases by the order of their detection times. It is, however possible to compen-
sate for that "walkoff", by inserting identical crystals of half the thickness

Again in order to see the interference effects the state is studied in a basis 
where the vertical and horizontal polarisations cannot be distinguished. This 
can be done simply by mixing the states in a polariser rotated to 45°. 
3.5 Bell-State Analyser 
D. Bouwmeester, H. Weinfurter, A. Zezlinger 
Formally speaking, a Bell-state analysis, required for quantum dense coding 
and for quantum teleportation (see Sects. 3.2 and 3.3), is not a problem. 
All you have to do is project any incoming state onto the Bell state basis, 
(3.1)-(3.4), and you will find out by repeating this experiment with which 
probability the original state can be found in one of the Bell states. The 
Bell states depend, of course, on the type of entanglement that is present. 
In the case of entanglement between the polarisation and the momentum 
degree of freedom of a single photon, the projection onto a complete Bell-
state basis is possible (see Sect. 3.8) with simple linear optical elements. In 
the case of polarisation entanglement between two photons, the situation is 
more complicated and, so far, only the projection onto two Bell states has 
been achieved, leaving the other two states degenerate in their detection. This 
partial Bell-state analysis will be explained in the next section. 
3.5.1 Photon Statistics at a Beamsplitter 
The partial Bell-state analysis of polarisation entanglement exploits the 
statistics of two qubits at a beamsplitter. The basic principle of that Bell-
state analyser rests on the observation that of the four Bell states (3.1)-(3.4) 
only one state is antisymmetric under exchange of the two particles. This is 
the ItP-h2 state (3.2), which clearly changes sign upon exchange of labels 1 
and 2. The other three states are symmetric. We thus observe that the qubit 
obeys fermionic symmetry in the case of ItP-h2 and bosonic symmetry in 
case of the other three states. Thus far we have not specified whether the 
particles carrying the qubits are bosons or fermions. In fact, the four Bell 
states could equally well be those of fermions or those of bosons. This is 
because the states written in (3.1)-(3.4) are not the complete states of the 
particles but describe only the internal (two-level) state of the particles. The 
total state can be obtained by adding the spatial state of the particles which 

3.5 Bell-State Analyser 
61 
could also be symmetric or antisymmetric. Then, in the case of bosons, the 
spatial part of the wave function has to be antisymmetric for the IIP-h2 state 
and symmetric for the other three, while for fermions this has to be just the 
reverse. 
Let us first consider two photons, which are bosons, and assume that the 
Bell states above describe the polarisation of the photons, that is, an internal 
degree of freedom. Then, clearly, the total state of the two photons has to be 
symmetric. For the case of the two particles incident symmetrically onto a 
beamsplitter, i.e., one entering from each input mode la) and Ib), the possible 
external (spatial) states are 
(3.17) 
(3.18) 
where lIP Ah2 and lIPs h2 are antisymmetric and symmetric, respectively. Be-
cause of the requirement of symmetry, the total two-photon states are 
(3.19) 
We note that only the state antisymmetric in external variables is also anti-
symmetric in internal variables. It is this state which also emerges from the 
beamsplitter in an external antisymmetric state. This can easily be found 
by assuming that the beamsplitter does not influence the internal state and 
by applying the beamsplitter operator (Hadamard transformation) on the 
external (spatial) state. Using 
1 
Hla) = J2 (Ic) + Id)) 
(3.20) 
1 
Hlb) = J2 (Ie) - Id)) 
(3.21) 
it can now easily be seen that 
(3.22) 
Therefore the spatially antisymmetric state is an eigenstate of the beamsplit-
ter operator [95, 96]. In contrast, in all three cases of the symmetric external 
state lIPs), the two photons emerge together in one of the two outputs of 
the beamsplitter. It is therefore evident that the state IIP-) can be clearly 
discriminated from all the other states. It is the only one of the four Bell 
states which leads to coincidences between detectors placed on each side af-
ter a beamsplitter [97]-[99]. How can we then identify the other three states? 
It turns out that distinction between IIP+) on the one hand and 14>+) and 
14>-) on the other hand can be based on the fact that only in IIP+) do the two 
photons have different polarisation while in the other two they have the same 

62 
3. Quantum Dense Coding and Quantum Teleportation 
polarisation. Thus performing polarisation measurements and observing the 
photons on the same side of the beamsplitter distinguishes the state IIP+) 
from the states 14>+) and 14>-). It should be remarked that a simple generali-
sation of this procedure implies that any two orthogonal maximally entangled 
states can be distinguished from each other in the same way, because by lo-
cal unitary transformations one can perform rotations in the two-dimensional 
Hilbert space. 
Consider now the same experiment with fermions [100] where again the 
Bell states describe the internal states, for example if the two qubits are 
entangled in spin, we find that the four possible states now are 
(3.23) 
because of the antisymmetry requirement of the total state. For fermions, 
therefore, only one of the states is spatially symmetric, the other three are 
spatially anti-symmetric. Thus in only one of the cases, namely for IIP-), 
will both fermions emerge together from the beamsplitter. In the other three 
cases they will emerge from different sides. Yet, remarkably, it is again this 
state which can immediately be distinguished from the other three because 
of its distinct symmetry properties. 
3.6 Experimental Dense Coding with Qubits 
A quantum-optical demonstration of the quantum dense coding scheme [75], 
described in Sect. 3.2, requires three distinct parts (Fig. 3.7): the EPR-source 
generating entangled photons, Bob's station for encoding the messages by a 
unitary transformation of his particle, and Alice's Bell-state analyser to read 
the signal sent by Bob. The polarisation-entangled photons can be produced 
by type-II parametric down-conversion (Sect. 3.4.4). A UV-beam (,X = 351 
nm) from an argon-ion laser is down-converted into pairs of photons (,X = 702 
nm) with orthogonal polarisation. 
The entangled state IIP+) is obtained after compensation of birefringence 
in the BBO crystal along two distinct emission directions (carefully selected 
by 2 mm irises, 1.5 m away from the crystal). One beam was first directed 
to Bob's encoding station, the other directly to Alice's Bell-state analyser; 
in the alignment procedure an optical trombone was employed to equalise 
the path lengths to well within the coherence length of the down-converted 
photons (£c ::::J 100/Lm), in order to enable Alice to perform a (partial) Bell-
state analysis. 
For polarisation encoding, the necessary transformations of Bob's particle 
were performed using a half-wave retardation plate for changing the polarisa-
tion and a quarter-wave plate to generate the polarisation dependent phase

shift2. The beam manipulated in this way in Bob's encoding station was then 
combined with the other beam at Alice's Bell-state analyser. It consisted of a 
single beamsplitter followed by two-channel polarisers in each of its outputs 
and proper coincidence analysis between four single photon detectors. 
Since only the state 11]1-) has an antisymmetric spatial part, only this state 
will be registered by coincidence detection between the different outputs of 
the beamsplitter (i.e. coincidence between detectors DH and DV' or between 
Dw and Dv). For the remaining three states both photons exit into the same 
output port of the beamsplitter. The state 11]1+) can easily be distinguished 
from the other two due to the different polarisations of the two photons, giv-
ing, behind the two-channel polariser, a coincidence between detectors DH 
and Dv or between Dw and Dv '. The two states I<t>+) and I<t>-) both result 
in a two-photon state being absorbed by a single detector and thus cannot

be distinguished. Table 3.1 gives an overview of the different manipulations 
and detection probabilities of Bob's encoder and Alice's receiver. 
The experiments were performed by first setting the output state of the 
source such that the state IlP+) left Bob's encoder when both retardation 
plates are set to vertical orientation; the other Bell-states could then be 
generated with the respective settings (Table 3.1). To characterize the inter-
ference observable at Alice's Bell-state analyser, we varied the path length 
difference L1 of the two beams with the optical trombone. For L1 ~ Cc no in-
terference occurs and one obtains classical statistics for the coincidence count 
rates at the detectors. For optimal path-length tuning (L1 = 0), interference 
enables one to read the encoded information. 
Figures 3.8 and 3.9 show the dependence of the coincidence rates CHV (.) 
and CHV'(o) on the path length difference for ItJi+) and ItJi-), respectively 
(the rates CH'V' and CH'V display analogous behaviour; we use the notation 
CAB for the coincidence rate between detectors DA and DB)' At L1 = 0, CHV 
reaches its maximum for ItJi+) (Fig. 3.8) and vanishes (aside from noise) for 
ItJi-) (Fig. 3.10). CHv' displays the opposite dependence and clearly signifies 
ItJi-). The results of these measurements imply that if both photons are 
detected, we can identify the state ItJi+) with a reliability of 95%, and the 
state ItJi-) with 93%. 
When using Si-avalanche diodes in the Geiger-mode for single photon 
detection, a modification of the Bell-state analyser is necessary, since then 
one also has to register the two photons leaving the Bell-state analyser for 
the states 14>+) or 14>-) via a coincidence detection. 3

3.7 Experimental Quantum Teleportation of Qubits 
D. Bouwmeester, J.- W. Pan, H. Weinfurter, A. Zeilinger 
In this section an experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation of 
qubits, encoded in the polarisation state of single photons, will be given [76]. 
During teleportation, an initial photon which carries the polarisation that is 
to be transferred and one of a pair of entangled photons are subjected to a 
measurement such that the second photon of the entangled pair acquires the 
polarisation of the initial photon. Figure 3.12 is a schematic drawing of the 
experimental setup. As explained in Sect. 3.3, an experimental realisation 
of quantum teleportation necessitates both creation and measurement of en-
tangled states, indicated in Fig. 3.12 by the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) 
source and the Bell-state measurement (BSM) respectively. The EPR source 
of polarisation entangled photons was described in Sect. 3.4 and the IP-h2 
Bell-state analyser was described in Sect. 3.5. 
The experimental realisation of the quantum teleportation of a qubit pre-
sented in this section is restricted to use the IP-h2 Bell-state projection 
only.4 The unitary transformation that Bob has to perform when Alice mea-
sures photon 1 and 2 in IP-)12 is simply the identity transformation, i.e. Bob 
should detect a photon in the same state as photon 1. 
To avoid photons 1 and 2, which are created independently, being dis-
tinguished by their arrival times at the detectors, which would eliminate 
the possibility of performing the Bell-state measurement, the following tech-
nique is used. Photon 2, together with its entangled partner photon 3, is 
produced by pulsed parametric down-conversion. The pump pulse, generated 
by a frequency-doubled mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser, is 200 fs long. 
The pulse is reflected back through the crystal (see Fig. 3.12) to create a sec-
ond pair of photons, photons 1 and 4. Photon 4 is used as a trigger to indicate 
the pi'esence of photon 1. Photons 1 and 2 are now located within 200 fs long 
pulses, which can be tuned by a variable delay such that maximal spatial 
overlap of the photons at the detectors is obtained. However, this does not 
yet guarantee indistinguishability upon detection since the entangled down-
converted photons typically have a coherence length corresponding to about 
a 50 fs long wavepacket, which is shorter than the pulses from the pump 
laser. Therefore, coincidence detection of photons 1 and 2 with their partners 
3 and 4 with a time resolution better than 50 fs could identify which pho-
tons were created together. To achieve indistinguishability upon detection, 
the photon wavepackets should be stretched to a length substantially longer 
than that of the pump pulse. In the experiment this was done by placing 4 
nm narrow interference filters in front of the detectors. These filter out pho-
4 It is possible to extent the Bell-state analyser into an analyser that can uniquely 
identify both the IP- h2 state and the IP+)J2 (see Sect. 3.5).

its second passage through the crystal, the ultraviolet pulse can create another pair 
of photons, one of which will be prepared in the initial state of photon 1 to be tele-
ported, the other one serving as a trigger indicating that a photon to be teleported 
is underway. Alice then looks for coincidences after a beamsplitter (BS) where the 
initial photon and one of the ancillaries are superposed. Bob, after receiving the 
classical information that Alice obtained a coincidence count in detectors fl and 
f2 identifying the IlJi-}t2 Bell-state, knows that his photon 3 is in the initial state 
of photon 1 which he then can check using polarisation analysis with the polaris-

information that photon 1 is underway.

maximum indistinguishability of photons 1 and 2 of about 85% [101]. 
All the important experimental components of the teleportation setup 
have now been discussed. This brings us to the question of how to prove 
experimentally that an unknown quantum state can be teleported with the 
above setup? For this, one has to show that teleportation works for a set of 
known non-orthogonal states. The test for non-orthogonal states is necessary 
to demonstrate the crucial role of quantum entanglement in the teleportation 
scheme. 5 
5 The reason for this is essentially the same as the reason why non-orthogonal 
states are used in constructing Bell's inequality (see Sect. 1.7 and references 
therein). 

3.7 Experimental Quantum Teleportation of Qubits 
69 
3.7.1 Experimental Results 
In the first experiment photon 1, which has encoded the initial qubit, is pre-
pared with a linear polarisation at 45 0 • Teleportation should work as soon 
as photons 1 and 2 are detected in the IIP-h2 state. This implies that if a 
coincidence between detectors f1 and f2 (Fig. 3.12) is recorded, i.e. photons 1 
and 2 are projected onto the lIP;;) state, then photon 3 should be polarised at 
45 0 (to within an irrelevant overall minus sign, see (3.6)). The polarisation of 
photon 3 is analysed by passing it through a polarising beamsplitter selecting 
+45 0 and -45 0 polarisation. To demonstrate teleportation, only detector d2 
at the +45 0 output of the polarising beamsplitter should detect a photon once 
f1 and f2 record a coincidence detection. Detector d1 at the -45 0 output of 
the polarising beamsplitter should not detect a photon. Therefore, recording 
a three-fold coincidence d2f1f2 (+45 0 analysis) together with the absence of 
a three-fold coincidence d1f1f2 (-45 0 analysis) is a proof that the polarisa-
tion of photon 1, which represents the initial qubit, has been transferred to 
photon 3. 
To meet the condition of indistiguishability of photons 1 and 2 (see previ-
ous subsection), the arrival time of photon 2 is varied by changing the delay 
between the first and second down-conversion by translating the retroflection 
mirror (see Fig. 3.12). Within the region of temporal overlap of photons 1 
and 2 at the detectors the teleportation should occur. 
Outside the region of teleportation photons 1 and 2 will each go to either 
f1 or to f2 independently of one another. The probability of obtaining a 
coincidence between f1 and f2 is therefore 50%. This is twice as high as the 
probability inside the region of teleportation since only the IIP-) component 
of the two-photon state entering the beamsplitter will give a coincidence 
recording. Since photon 2 is part of an entangled state it does not have a 
well-defined polarisation on its own, and the joint state of photons 1 and 2 
is an equal superposition of all four Bell states, irrespective of the state of 
photon 1. Photon 3 should also have no well-defined polarisation because it 
is entangled with photon 2. Therefore, d1 and d2 both have a 50% chance 
of receiving photon 3. This simple argument yields a 25% probability both 
for the -45 0 analysis (d1f1f2 coincidences) and for the +45 0 analysis (d2f1f2 
coincidences) outside the region of teleportation. 
Figure 3.13 summarises the predictions as a function of the delay. Suc-
cessful teleportation of the +45 0 polarisation state is then characterized by 
a decrease to zero in the -45 0 analysis, see Fig. 3.13a, and by a constant 
value for the +45 0 analysis, see Fig. 3.13b. Note that the above arguments 
are conditional upon the detection of a trigger photon by detector p (see 
Fig. 3.12). 
The experimental results for teleportation of photons polarised at +45 0 
are shown in the first panel of Fig. 3.14. Figure 3.14a and 3.14b should be 
compared with the theoretical predictions shown in Fig. 3.13.

Fig. 3.13. Theoretical prediction for the three-fold coincidence probability between 
the two Bell-state detectors (fl, f2) and one of the detectors analysing the teleported 
state. The signature of teleportation of a photon polarisation state at +450 is a dip 
to zero at zero delay in the three-fold coincidence rate with the detector analysing 
-450 (dlflf2) (a) and a constant value for the detector analysis +45 0 (d2flf2) (b). 
The shaded area indicates the region of teleportation. 
The strong decrease in the -45 0 analysis, and the constant signal for 
the +45 0 analysis, indicate that photon 3 is polarised along the direction of 
photon I , consistent with the quantum teleportation protocol. Note again 
that a four-fold coincidence detection has been used where the fourth photon 
is a trigger that indicates the presence of photon 1. 
To rule out any classical explanation for the experimental results, a four-
fold coincidence measurement for the case of teleportation of the + 900 polar-
isation states, that is, for a state non-orthogonal to the +45 0 state, has been 
performed. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3.14c and 3.14d. Vis-
ibilities of 70% ± 3% are obtained for the dips in the orthogonal polarisation 
states. 
From Fig. 3.14 one can directly obtain the measured fidelity of telepor-
tation of a qubit encoded in the polarisation of a single-photon state. The

arrival of photons 1 and 2 at Alice's beamsplitter (see Fig. 3.12). These data, in 
cunjunction with with Fig. 3.13, confirm teleportation for an arbitrary qubit state. 
fidelity is defined as the overlap of the input qubit with the teleported qubit 
and is plotted in Fig. 3.15. In the experiment, the detection of the teleported 
photons played the double role of filtering out the experimental runs in which 
there is a single input qubit present and of measuring the fidelity of the tele-
portation procedure. With respect to the filtering, note that two detection 
events at Alice's Bell-state analyser could have been due to two pairs of pho-
tons both created during the return passage of the pump pulse. Then no 
photon will be observed by Bob [83]' but two photons will travel towards 
detector p. This situation can be identified and therefore eliminated by using 
a detector p that can discriminate between a one-photon and a two-photon 
impact [102]. 
Whether or not such a modified detection is used, the measured fidelity 
will be the same [84] and is primarily determined by the degree of indis-
tinguishability of the photons detected in Alice's Bell-state analyser. The

amount of indistinguishability is directly related to the ratio of the band-
width of the pump pulse and the interference filters. The larger this ratio the 
higher the fidelity but the lower the count rates. 
3.7.2 Teleportation of Entanglement 
Instead of using the fourth photon in the experiment described above as a 
mere trigger to indicate that photon 1 is underway, one can explore the fact 
that photon 1 and 4 can also be produced in an entangled state, say in the 
Iw-h4 state, as illustrated in Fig. 3.16. 
The state of photon 1 is therefore completely undetermined and all the 
information is stored in joint properties of photons 1 and 4. If photon 1 is 
now subjected to quantum teleportation as described in the previous section, 
photon 3 obtains the properties of photon 1 and therefore becomes entangled 
with photon 4 (see Fig. 3.16). Interestingly, photon 4 and photon 3 originate 
from different sources and never interacted directly with one another, yet 
they form an entangled pair after the quantum teleportation procedure. The 
experimental verification of this process of transferring entanglement [86], 
known as entanglement swapping, and several possible applications [85, 87] 
will be described in Sects. 3.10 and 3.11. 
3.7.3 Concluding Remarks and Prospects 
Pairs of polarisation entangled photons and two-photon interferometric meth-
ods have been used to transfer one qubit encoded in the polarisation state of 
one photon onto another one. Teleportation has also been addressed in other

ever, quantum teleportation is by no means restricted to optical experiments. 
In addition to pairs of entangled photons one can employ entangled atoms 
[103], and one can, in principle, entangle photons with atoms or phonons 
with ions, and so on. Then teleportation would allow the transfer of the state 
of, for example, fast-decohering, short-lived particles onto some more sta-
ble systems. This opens up the possibility of quantum memories, where the 
information of incoming photons is stored on trapped ions/atoms, carefully 
shielded from the environment. 
Furthermore, with entanglement purification [49] (see Chap. 8), a scheme 
for improving the quality of entanglement when it has been degraded by de-
coherence during storage or transmission of the particles over noisy channels, 
it becomes possible to send the quantum state of a particle to some place, 
even if the available quantum channels are of limited quality and thus send-
ing the particle itself might destroy the fragile quantum state. If the distance 
over which one wants to send the quantum state through a noisy quantum 
channel becomes too long, the fidelity of transmission becomes too low for the 
application of the standard purification method. In this situation the quan-
tum repeater method allows one to divide the quantum channel into shorter 
segments that are purified separately and then connected by entanglement 
swapping [104] (Sect. 8.7). The feasibility of preserving quantum states in 
a hostile environment will have great advantages in the realm of quantum 
communication and quantum computation.

3.8 A Two-Particle Scheme for Quantum Teleportation 
D. Bouwmeester 
The teleportation scheme, as described in Sect. 3.3, presents two new con-
cepts. First, it shows how entanglement can be used as part of a quantum 
communication channel. Second, it shows that the information associated 
with the state of a quantum particle can be physically decomposed into, and 
reconstructed from a classical component and a genuine quantum one. Alone, 
neither of these two components contain any information whatsoever about 
the quantum state; put together, they determine it completely. 
In the previous section these concepts were demonstrated using three-
and four-photon experiments. A limitation of these experiments was that 
Alice could not perform a full Bell-state measurement, which reduced the 
efficiency of the quantum state teleportation. A full Bell-state measurement 
would imply a controlled interaction between two photons, which is extremely 
difficult to implement in practice. The scheme described here, which was 
proposed by S. Popescu [77] and experimentally realised in Rome [78], avoids 
this problem but does place restrictions on the quantum states that can be 
transferred. 
The original teleportation scheme involves three particles. Two of the 
particles, one sent to Alice and one sent to Bob are in an entangled state 
(singlet) and constitute the "non-local communication channel". The third 
particle is initially in the state W which Alice has to transmit. One might 
imagine that the particle was prepared in this state by a third party, the 
Preparer, or that Alice acquired it herself directly from nature. The scheme 
considered here involves only two particles, namely the ones which form the 
non-local channel. The Preparer has to help Alice by encoding W directly into 
her member of the singlet pair instead of encoding it into a third particle. To 
this end, the Preparer uses some other degree of freedom of Alice's particle, 
different from the degree of freedom by which it is entangled with Bob's 
particle. This doesn't change the problem facing Alice - Alice cannot find 
out what W is. So if she were limited to the use of classical channels she 
couldn't help Bob prepare his particle in the state W. However, by using the 
nonlocal quantum channel she is able to accomplish the task, transferring the 
quantum state to Bob. 
In this two-particle scheme Alice's actions are simpler than in the three-
particle scheme, since to make different degrees of freedom of the same par-
ticle interact is often easier than to make two different particles interact. 
We will describe the two-particle protocol for quantum teleportation 
by going step by step through the optical experimental setup proposed in 
Ref. [77]. The first step is to produce two photons entangled in their direc-
tion of propagation, i.e. entangled in momentum, but each with a well-defined

this can be achieved [78]. Using type-II parametric down-conversion, one first 
creates the polarisation entangled state

Iw ) = V2 (IHhlVh + IVhlHh) , 
(3.24) 
where 1 and 2 label the two output directions of the correlated photons. Fol-
lowing this, both photons are passed through polarising beamsplitters which 
deflect/transmit horizontal/vertical photons. This transfers the polarisation 
entanglement into momentum entanglement resulting in the state 
(3.25) 
Labels 1 and 2 now indicate the double channels that lead to Alice and Bob 
respectively. Photons with label 1 are necessarily H polarised and photons 
with label 2 necessarily V polarised. The momentum entangled photons form 
the nonlocal transmission channel. 
On the way to Alice photon 1 is intercepted by the Preparer P who 
changes the polarisation from H to an arbitrary quantum superposition 
Itlih = alHh + iJlVh . 
(3.26) 
The Prepare affects the polarisation in both paths al and b1 in the same 
way. The state Itlih is the quantum state that Alice wants to transmit to 

76

Bob. Note that it is crucial that both the spatial and polarisation degrees of 
freedom of the quantum particles are being used.6 The total state 1q5) of the 
two photons after the preparation is 
(3.27) 
which is the formal analogue of the state !li123 in (3.6). 
The next step in the protocol is that Alice performs a joint (Bell-state) 
measurement on the initial state l!lih and on her part of the momentum 
entangled state. Assuming that there is a way to project photon 1 onto the 
four Bell states for its polarisation and momentum, we obtain the equivalent 
of (3.6):

+ (lal)IHh + Ib1)IV)d(ala2) + f3lb2))lVh 
+ (lal)IHh -lb1)lVh)(ala2) - /3Ib2))lVh 1 . 
(3.28) 
The first part of each term corresponds to a Bell state for photon 1 and 
the second part to the corresponding state of photon 2. In contrast to the 
case of the three-particle protocol, the projection of particle 1 onto the Bell-
state basis does not pose a serious problem, and can be achieved with al-
most 100% efficiency. For the projection we have to entangle the polarisation 
and directional properties of photon 1. This can be done by using polaris-
ing beamsplitters in paths al and b1 , and by combining the V component 
coming from al (lal)IVh) with the H component coming from b1 (lb1)IHh), 
and vice versa. The combination, sensitive to the relative phase, is obtained 
by rotating the photons to the same polarisation and letting them interfere 
on a normal beamsplitter. A photon detection by D 1 , D 2 , D 3 , or D4 now 
corresponds directly to a projection onto one of the four Bell states. 
The final step of the protocol is that Alice informs Bob which detector 
registered a photon. With this information Bob can reproduce the inital po-
larisation state as follows. He first transforms the momentum superposition 
of photon 2 (see (3.28)) into the same superposition in polarisation by simply 
using a 90° rotation plate in paths b2 (or a2) and a polarising beamsplitter 
to combine the paths. After this, he just switches two optical elements on or 
off, depending on the information obtained from Alice, to interchange Hand 
V and to provide a relative phase shift of 1f between Hand V. This trans-
forms the polarisation state of photon 2 into the polarisation state prepared 
on photon 1, and thus completes the transmission. 
6 M. Zukowski proposed to use both the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom 
of particles for generating "three-particle" GHZ entanglement using only two 
particles [105]. 

3.9 Teleportation of Continuous Quantum Variables 
77 
An advantage of the present scheme is that it uses a full Bell-state mea-
surement and only two particles in demonstrating two basic concepts of tele-
portation: it proves that quantum information can be decomposed into the 
classical and the genuine quantum part, and it displays the nonlocal trans-
mission. Furthermore it has a high efficiency compared to the three-particle 
scheme described in the previous section. 
A drawback of the scheme is that it does not allow Alice to teleport 
the state of an outside particle. Therefore it requires the Preparer's help: the 
initial polarisation state given to Alice has to be prepared on a particle which 
is momentum entangled with the one given to Bob. Also the state tJr has to 
be pure, implying that it cannot be part of an entangled state. 
We refer to Ref. [78] for details about the experimental realisation of the 
setup described above and for the experimental data confirming the transfer 
of the quantum state from Alice to Bob.

D. Bouwmeester 
3.9.1 Employing Position and Momentum Entanglement 
In this section we outline the basic idea of another scheme for quantum tele-
portation, proposed by 1. Vaidman [79], further elaborated on by Braunstein 
and Kimble [80], and experimentally realised at Caltech [81]. This scheme 
uses position and momentum entanglement instead of polarisation entangle-
ment. The result of this quantum teleportation scheme is that the position 
and momentum (defining the external state) of a quantum system are trans-
ferred to a distant quantum system, in contrast to the schemes discussed 
in Sects. 3.7 and 3.8 where the internal state (polarisation) was transferred. 
An important difference between position and momentum compared to po-
larisation is their representation in terms of superpositions of certain basis 
states. Position and momentum both require an infinite number of basis states 
since, to any two different positions or momenta there correspond two dif-
ferent eigenstates which are orthogonal (position eigenstates and momentum 
eigenstates form an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space). The polarisation of 
a particle can however be expressed as the superposition of only two basis 
states (polarisation has a two-dimensional Hilbert space). 
Consider the case in which Alice has a quantum particle with a certain 
position Xl and momentum PI (see Fig. 3.18), and she wishes to send this

quantum information to Bob who is at a distant location. Due to the Heisen-
berg uncertainty relation between x and p, which follows from the fact that 
the operators for position and momentum do not commute, [x,p] = in, Alice 
cannot measure both Xl and Pi with arbitrary precision. Therefore, quantum 
mechanics forbids Alice to obtain the information she wishes to transfer. The 
way out of this dilemma is conceptually the same as the protocol described 
in Sect. 3.3. In the same manner an auxiliary pair of entangled particles, pro-
duced by the EPR source in Fig. 3.18, has to be distributed between Alice 
and Bob. However, the auxiliary particles should now be entangled in their 
position and momentum. Let us consider the case in which the entanglement 
of particles 2 and 3 is described by the conditions: 
X2 + X3 = 0 ,and P2 - P3 = 0 . 
(3.29) 
The properties of the individual particles, X2, X3, P2, and P3 are completely 
undetermined by (3.29). Instead, their joint properties are defined. Note that, 
although the operators x and p do not commute for each particle, the op-
erators for (X2 + X3) and (P2 - P3) do commute as a result of the relative 
minus sign between the addition of the positions and the addition of mo-
menta. Therefore, for the entangled state the joint properties, (X2 + X3) and 
(P2 - P3) , can both be measured with an arbitrary accuracy. 
The next step in the protocol is that Alice performs the equivalent of a 
Bell-state measurement on particles 1 and 2. That is, the state of particles 1 
and 2 is projected onto an entangled state. In the case of teleport at ion of the 
internal (polarisation) state of a particle, there are only 4 possible outcomes 
for the Bell-state measurement since the polarisation entanglement between 
two particles, each individually with a two-dimensional Hilbert space, can 
be represented as a superposition of 4 basis states. In the present case the 
measurement by Alice yields 

3.9 Teleportation of Continuous Quantum Variables 
79 
Xl + X2 = a, and PI -
P2 = b, 
(3.30) 
where a and b are two real numbers which both have a continuous range of 
possible values. This indicates that the measurement of the sum of positions 
and the difference in momenta of the two particles requires the projection 
onto an (00 )-dim Hilbert space. 
As a result of the initial entanglement (3.29) and of Alice's measurement 
(3.30), the information obtained about the quantum state in the hands of 
Bob is 
X3 = Xl - a, and P3 = PI - b. 
(3.31) 
To complete the quantum teleportation protocol, all Alice has to do is to send 
Bob via a classical channel the results of her measurements, i.e. the measured 
values a and b, and then Bob just displaces the position and momentum of 
his particle by a and b, respectively. The final result is that Bob has particle 
3 in the initial quantum state of particle 1. 
3.9.2 Quantum Optical Implementation 
The experimental implementation of quantum teleportation of continuous 
quantum variables has been performed at Caltech, California [81]. This im-
plementation does not use the position X and momentum P of particles but 
uses light beams that can be characterized by parameters obeying the same 
commutation relations as x and p. The analogy is based on the fact that a 
single (transversal) mode of the quantized radiation field can be characterized 
by a quantum harmonic oscillator [106]-[109]. 
The classical harmonic oscillator of mass m, frequency w, displacement x, 
and momentum P is described by the Hamiltonian 
p2 
m 
H= -
+ _w2x 2 .

(3.32) 
To obtain the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian, X and P should be inter-
preted as operators (x ---+ x, and P ---+ P = itia/ax) which obey the commuta-
tion relation [x,p] = iti. If we define 
x = J ti (at + a) ,

(3.33) 
(3.34) 
then the Hamiltonian for the quantized harmonic oscillator takes the natural 
form

(3.38) 
(3.39) 
with In) the nth-excited state of the quantum harmonic oscillator and N 
the number operator. According to (3.36) and (3.37), a and at can be inter-
preted as the annihilation (lowering) and creation (raising) operators for the 
harmonic oscillator. 
A single transversal mode (frequency w) of the quantized radiation field 
can be expressed in terms of the operators a and at. In its most basic form, 
i.e. including all prefactors into a single constant Eo and considering one 
polarisation direction, the electric field vector operator at a fixed position is 
given by 
(3.40) 
where at and a are now interpreted as the photon-creation and photon-
annihilation operators. In analogy to the harmonic oscillator, we can define 
operators X and F via 
X = (at + a) , 
F=i(at -a). 
(3.41) 
(3.42) 
The electric field operator can now be expressed in terms of X and F as 
E(t)=Eo(Xcos(wt)+Fsin(wt)) . 
(3.43) 
The eigenvalues of X and F, referred to as the quadrature field amplitudes, 
can be interpreted as the amplitudes of the in- and out-of-phase components 
of the electric field (with respect to a local oscillator). From the commutation 
relation [X,F] = 2i it follows that .dX.dP = 1 ((.dA)2 = (A2)_(A)2), which 
means that the in- and out-of-phase amplitudes cannot be simultaneously 
measured with arbitrary accuracy, in close analogy to the position x and 
momentum p of a quantum particle. Hence we have now established the 
mapping of x and p for a particle to X and P for a single-mode light field. 
The next step towards an implementation of the quantum teleportation 
scheme with continuous parameters is to construct entangled light fields. To 
achieve this we need to introduce the notion of squeezed light [108]. It is 
instructive to visualise the quantum state of a single-mode light field in the 
X, Y plane. The vacuum state is represented by disc 1 around the origin in 
Fig. 3.19. Disc 2 in Fig. 3.19 represents a "coherent field" which is defined as 
a displaced vacuum field.

The discs indicate the minimum uncertainty in the values for X and P. 
The uncertainty is symmetric in X and P, however this symmetry is not 
necessary in order to fulfill the relation LlX LlP = 1. The ellipse in Fig. 3.19 
represents a squeezed state for which (Lly)2 < 1 and necessarily (LlX)2 > 1. 
Consider now the case of two light fields A and 13 maximally squeezed in 
X and Y , respectively, and let these beams enter the two input ports of a 
50/50 beamsplitter as illustrated in Fig. 3.20. Behind the beamsplitter the 
fields labeled with 2 and 3 are characterized by the relations 
(3.44) 
which specify precisely the desired entangled state [81]. (For polarisation 
entangled light fields see Refs. [110]-[112].)

combined inside a nonlinear crystal (X2 material) with a strong pump field with fre-
quency W3. As a result of the nonlinear interaction, the signal field will be amplified 
and a third field will be created with the frequency W2 = W3 -
Wj. 
The production of squeezed states, as required for the generation of en-
tangled light fields, is based on parametric amplification inside a nonlinear 
crystal [107, 112, 113]. An incoming signal field with frequency WI will be 
combined inside a nonlinear crystal with a strong pump field with frequency 
W3 (see Fig. 3.21). As a result of the nonlinear interaction, the signal field will 
be amplified and a third field will be created with the frequency W2 = W3 - WI. 
We consider the simplest case involving only one polarisation direction, as-
suming collinear phase matching, that is all fields propagate in the same 
direction, and taking the degenerate case of WI = W2 == wand W3 = 2w. 
The evolution of the radiation field with frequency w, interacting inside 
the crystal with the strong field at frequency 2w, is described by the following 
Hamiltonian, 
iI = I'iM.; (ata+~) + Scos(2wt) (at _ 0,)2 
(3.45) 
The second term on the right-hand side of (3.45) describes the interaction 
between the pump field, which is described classically, and the two fields at 
degenerate frequency w. S is the coupling strength which depends on the 
nonlinearity inside the crystal and on the pump intensity. The principle of 
energy conservation reduces this interaction term to 
(3.46) 
The time evolution of the radiation field operator (we work in the Heisen-
berg representation in which the operators evolve as a function of time) is 
determined by the evolution equations for a and at: 
~! =-*[a,iI] =-iwa-iSate-t2wt, 
(3.47) 
d't 
~ = -* [at, iI] = iwat + iSae+t2wt . 
(3.48) 
This set of coupled equations decouples if we use the operators X and P 
as defined in (3.41) and (3.42). The evolution equations for the quadrature 
field-amplitude operators are simply

(3.49) 
which have the solutions 
X(t) = X(O)e St , 
F(t) = F(O)e- St . 
(3.50) 
As a function of the interaction time, t, the in-phase amplitude operator 
X grows exponentially whereas the out-of-phase amplitude operator F de-
creases exponentially. Degenerate parametric amplification thus acts as a 
phase-sensitive amplifier, providing gain to in-phase ('P = Omod7r) signals 
and damping to out-of-phase ('P = (7r /2)mod7r) signals. In other words, the 
parametric amplification of a signal will squeeze the P component of the light 
field. 
To enhance the interaction time, and hence the amount of squeezing, the 
nonlinear crystal is usually placed inside an optical cavity which is resonant 
with w. Such a device is called an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The 
cavity losses are kept slightly larger than the parametric amplification to pre-
vent laser operation and hence the build up of very high intensity light fields 
which would introduce saturation effects (mixing of higher order nonlineari-
ties) inside the crystal. In the experiment reported in Ref. [81] there was no 
external field at frequency w injected in the OPO, so that only the vacuum 
is amplified. 
Having described the production of EPR light fields using two squeezed 
light fields and a beamsplitter, we now turn to the problem of performing a 
Bell-state-like measurement. Whereas the Bell-state analyser for polarisation 
entangled states posed experimental problems, see Sect. :1.5, here the pro-
jection onto an entangled state is straightforward. Mixing the initial beam, 
characterized by (X I, Pd, with one beam coming from the EPR source, rep-
resented by (X2' P2), onto a 50/50 beamsplitter, yields in the two output 
ports beams characterized by 
(Xc, Pc) = (Xl - X 2 , PI - P2 ), and (Xv, Pv ) = (Xl + X 2 , PI + P2 ). 
(3.51 ) 
Using the balanced homodyne detection method (see e.g. Ref. [107]), Alice 
can now measure the X component of beam V and the P component of C, 
providing her with the values a = Xl + X 2 , and b = Pl -
P2 , respectively, 
as required for the quantum teleportation protocol. The balanced homo dyne 
detection method is based on mixing of the signal field with a local oscillator 
on a 50/50 beamsplitter and the recording of the difference in the photocur-
rent (proportional to the field intensity) between two detectors in the output 
arms of the beamsplitter. The difference in measured intensity as a function 
of the phase 'P of the local oscillator is given by [107] 
(3.52) 

84 
3. Quantum Dense Coding and Quantum Teleportation 
where C is an overall constant depending on the intensity of the local oscil-
lator and on the properties of the detectors. Tuning the phase 'P of the local 
oscillator, one can measure any superposition of the quadrature components. 
Following the quantum teleportation scheme, Alice sends to Bob the mea-
sured values a and b and Bob has to displace the light field at his side ac-
cordingly. Bob can achieve the displacement experimentally by reflecting his 
light field from a partially reflecting mirror (say 99% reflection and 1 % trans-
mission) and adding through the mirror a field that has been phase and 
amplitude modulated according to the values a and b. In principle, Bob ends 
up with an almost perfect replica of the light field that was initially in the 
hands of Alice. 
The actual experiment, reported in Ref. [81], requires several sophisticated 
experimental techniques, such as the generation of highly squeezed states and 
the precise alignment in positions and phases of the light fields. Imperfections 
in these techniques limited the quality, defined here as the measured overlap 
of the input state at Alice and the teleported state at Bob, to 0.58 ± 0.02. 
This quality is, however, higher than the limit of 0.5 which can be obtained 
(under the assumption that the output state falls in the class of coherent 
states) by only classical communication between Alice and Bob.

3.10 Entanglement Swapping: 
Teleportation of Entanglement 
D. Bouwmeester, J- W. Pan, H. Weinjurter, A. Zeilznger 
Entanglement can be realised by having two entangled particles emerge from 
a common source [94, 114] (Sect. 3.4), or by allowing two particles to interact 
with each other [103, 115] (Sects. 4.3, 5.2.4 and 5.2.11). Yet, another possi-
bility to obtain entanglement is to make use of a projection of the state of 
two particles onto an entangled state. This projection measurement does not 
necessarily require a direct interaction between the two particles: When each 
of the particles is entangled with one other partner particle, an appropriate 
measurement, for example, a Bell-state measurement, of the partner parti-
cles will automatically collapse the state of the remaining two particles into 
an entangled state. This striking application of the projection postulate is 
referred to as entanglement swapping [74, 85, 87]. 
Consider two EPR sources, each simultaneously emitting a pair of entan-
gled particles (Fig. 3.22). In anticipation of the experiments described below, 
we assume that these are polarisation entangled photons in the state

Fig. 3.22. Principle of entanglement swapping. Two EPR sources produce two pairs 
of entangled photons, pair 1-2 and pair 3-4. One photon from each pair (photons 
2 and 3) is subjected to a Bell-state measurement. This results in a projection the 
other two outgoing photons, 1 and 4, onto an entangled state. Change of shading of 
the lines indicates the change in the set of possible predictions that can be made. 
(3.53) 
The total state describes the fact that photons 1 and 2 (3 and 4) are entangled 
in an antisymmetric polarisation state. Yet, the state of pair 1-2 is factorisable 
from the state of pair 3-4, that is, there is no entanglement of either of the 
photons 1 or 2 with either of the photons 3 or 4. 
We now perform a joint Bell-state measurement on photons 2 and 3, 
that is, photons 2 and 3 are projected onto one of the four Bell states (see 
Sect. 3.5). This measurement also projects photons 1 and 4 onto a Bell state, 
one that depends on the result of the Bell-state measurement for photons 2 
and 3. Close inspection shows that for the initial state given in (3.53) the 
emerging state of photons 1 and 4 will be identical to the one onto which 
photons 2 and 3 are projected. This is a consequence of the fact that the 
state of (3.53) can be rewritten as 
1 
IlJi)1234 = "2 ( IlJi+)14I lJi+)23 -llJi- )14I lJi-)23 
- 14>+)1414>+)23 + 14>-)1414>-)23 ) . 
(3.54) 
In all cases photons 1 and 4 emerge entangled, despite the fact that they 
never interacted in the past. After projection of particles 2 and 3 one knows 
about the entanglement between particles 1 and 4. 
As already noted in Sect. 3.7.2, entanglement swapping can also be 
viewed as the teleportation of an entangled state, and the experimental setup 
(Fig. 3.23) used for its demonstration is similar to the teleportation setup 
shown in Fig. 3.12. We refer to Sect. 3.7 for a description of the common 
features of the setups. The essential difference between the two experiments 
is that in the teleportation scheme for single qubits (Fig. 3.12) photon 4 
played the role of a trigger, indicating the presence of photon 1, whereas here 
(Fig. 3.23) the entanglement between each pair of photons is fully utilised.

Fig. 3.23. Experimental setup. A UV pulse passing through a nonlinear crystal 
creates pair 1-2 of entangled photons. Photon 2 is directed to the beamsplitter. 
After reflection, during its second passage through the crystal the UV pulse creates 
a second pair 3-4 of entangled photons. Photon 3 will also be directed to the beam-
splitter. When photons 2 and 3 yield a coincidence click at the two detectors behind 
the beamsplitter they are projected into the Itlr )23 state. As a consequence of this 
Bell-state measurement the two remaining photons 1 and 4 will also be projected 
into an entangled state. To analyse their entanglement one looks at coincidences 
between detectors Dl + and D4, and between detectors Dl - and D4, for different 
polarisation angles e. By rotating the >../2 plate in front of the polarising beam-
splitter one can analyse photon 1 in any linear polarisation basis. Note that, since 
the detection of coincidences between detectors Dl + and D4, and Dl- and D4 are 
conditional on the detection of the t[t- state, one looks at 4-fold coincidences. 
Entanglement swapping can be seen as teleportation either of the state of 
photon 2 over to photon 4 or the state of photon 3 over to photon 1. Those 
viewpoints are completely equivalent. The remarkable feature of the scheme is 
that the state actually teleported is a photon state which is not well defined. 
As is well known, the state of a particle which is maximally entangled to 
another has to be described by a maximally mixed density matrix. Therefore, 
what is teleported in such a situation is not the quantum state of the photon 
but just the way in which it was entangled with another photon. 
According to the entanglement swapping scheme, upon projection of pho-
tons 2 and 3 onto the IP-'23 state, photons 1 and 4 should be projected onto 
the IP-'14 state. To verify that this entangled state is obtained we have to 
analyse the polarisation correlations between photons 1 and 4 conditional on 
coincidences between the detectors of the Bell-state analyser. If photons 1 
and 4 are in the IP- ) 14 state their polarisations should be orthogonal upon 
measurement in any polarisation basis. Using a ),,/2 retardation plate at 22.50 
and two detectors (Dl + and Dl- ) behind a polarising beamsplitter, one can 
analyse the polarisation of photon 1 along the +450 axis (Dl +) and the -45 0

direction 8. 
If entanglement swapping occurs, then the two-fold coincidences between 
D1 + and D4, and between D1- and D4, conditional on the IW-)23 detection, 
should show two sine curves as a function of 8 which are 90° out of phase. 
The D1 +D4 curve should, in principle, go to zero for 8 = 45° whereas the 
D1-D4 curve should show a maximum at this position. Figure 3.24 shows the 
experimental results for the coincidences between D1 + and D4, and between 
D1- and D4, given that photons 2 and 3 have been registered by the two 
detectors in the Bell-state analyser. 
Note that this method requires four-fold coincidences. The result clearly 
demonstrates the expected sine curves, complementary for the two detectors 
(D1 + and D1-), registering photon 1 along orthogonal polarisations. By ad-
ditional measurements it was verified that the sine curves are independent 
(up to the corresponding shift in 8) of the detection basis of photon 1, that 
is, independent of the rotation angle of the ),,/2 retardation plate. The ob-
served visibility of 0.65 clearly surpasses the 0.5 limit of a classical wave 
theory. Note that this result is a realisation of quantum teleport at ion in a 
clear quantum situation, since entanglement between two particles that did 
not share a common origin nor interacted with one another in the past is the 
very result of the procedure. In the following section several applications of 
entanglement swapping will be presented.

3.11 Applications of Entanglement Swapping 
S. Bose, V. Vedral and P.L. Knight 
Entanglement swapping can be used for a number of practical purposes: con-
structing a quantum telephone exchange, to speed up the distribution of en-
tangled particles between two parties, in a sort of series purification and for 
the construction of entangled states involving higher number of particles [87J. 
We describe these applications in some detail below. 
3.11.1 Quantum Telephone Exchange 
Suppose there are N users in a communication network. To begin with, each 
user of the network needs to share entangled pairs of particles (in a Bell state) 
with a central exchange. Consider Fig. 3.25 : A, B, C and D are users who 
share the Bell pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8) respectively with a central 
exchange O. Now suppose that A, Band C wish to share a GHZ triplet. Then 
a measurement which projects particles 2, 3 and 5 to GHZ states will have 
to be performed at O. Immediately, particles 1, 4 and 6 belonging to A, B 
and C respectively will be reduced to a GHZ state. In a similar manner one 
can entangle particles belonging to any N users of the network and create a 
N-particle cat state. 
The main advantages of using this technique for establishing entanglement 
over the simple generation of N-particle entangled states at a source and their 
subsequent distribution are as follows. 
7 
6 
4 
Fig. 3.25. The configuration used for the distribution of entanglement. Initially 
users A,B,C and D share Bell pairs with the central exchange O. Subsequently, a 
local measurement at 0 is sufficient to entangle particles belonging to any subset 
of users chosen from A, B, C and D . 

3.11 Applications of Entanglement Swapping 
89 
(A) Firstly, each user can at first purify a large number of partially deco-
he red Bell pairs shared with the central exchange to obtain a smaller number 
of pure shared Bell pairs. These can then be used as the starting point for the 
generation of any types of multi particle cat states of the particles possessed 
by the users. The problems of decoherence during propagation of the parti-
cles can thus be avoided (at least in principle). Also the necessity of having 
to purify N-particle cat states can be totally avoided. Purification of singlets 
followed by our scheme will generate N-particle cats in their purest form. 
(B) Secondly, our method allows a certain degree of freedom to entangle 
particles belonging to any set of users only if the necessity arises. It may not 
be known in advance exactly which set of users will need to share an N-
particle cat state. To arrange for all possibilities in an a priori fashion would 
require selecting all possible combinations of users and distributing particles 
in multiparticle entangled states among them. That is very uneconomical. 
On the other hand, generating entangled N-tuplets at the time of need and 
supplying them to the users who wish to communicate is definitely time 
consuming. 
Biham, Huttner and Mor [116] have developed a similar scheme of cryp-
tographic network with exchanges using a time reversed EPR scheme for 
setting up the connections. 
3.11.2 Speeding up the Distribution of Entanglement 
We now explain how standard entanglement swapping helps to save a sig-
nificant amount of time when one wants to supply two distant users with a 
pair of atoms or electrons (or any particle possessing mass) in a Bell state 
from some central source. The trick is to place several Bell-state-producing 
and Bell-state-measuring substations in the route between them. Consider 
Fig. 3.26a: A and B are two users separated by a distance L; 0, which is sit-
uated midway between A and B is a source of Bell pairs. The time needed for 
the particles to reach A and B is at least tl = L/2v where 71< c (the speed of 
light) is the speed of the particles. Now consider Fig.3.26b in which two Bell 
pair producing stations C and D are introduced halfway between AO and BO, 
respectively, and ° is now just a Bell state measuring station. At t = O. both 
C and D send off Bell pairs (1,2) and (3,4) respectively. 2 and 3 arrive at 0, 
1 reaches A and 4 reaches B. They all arrive at their destinations exactly at 
t = L/4v. At this instant a Bell state measurement is performed on particles 
2 and 3 at 0. This measurement immediately reduces the particles 1 and 4 
reaching A and B respectively, to a Bell state. If the time of measurement 
is denoted by tm , then the time needed to supply a Bell pair to A and B 
with the two extra substations C and D on the path is t2 = L / 471 + tm. It 
is evident that t2 is less than tl if tm < L/4v. Of course, to this time one 
must add the time needed to classically communicate between the station ° 
and the users A and B the particular Bell state to which particles 1 and 4 
are projected. So for photons in Bell states, this procedure does not really

save any time. But for particles possessing mass, this is definitely one way 
to reduce the time needed to supply two distant users with a Bell pair. In 
this way one can reduce the time needed to supply two distant users with a 
Bell pair even further by including more and more Bell pair producing and 
measuring substations on the way. 
3.11.3 Correction of Amplitude Errors Developed 
due to Propagation 
We would like to show that entanglement swapping can be used, with some 
probability which we quantify, to correct amplitude errors that might develop 
in maximally entangled states during propagation. Assume that in Fig. 3.26b, 
the Bell pairs emitted from C and D acquire amplitude errors and become 
less entangled states of the type 
IP) = cos 8101) + sin811O)· 
(3.55) 
Thus, the combined state of the two entangled pairs, when particles 2 and 3 
reach ° is given by, 
14» = cos2 810101) +sin8cos8(11001) 
+ 10110)) + sin2 811010). 
(3.56) 
If a Bell state measurement is now performed on particles 2 and 3 that 
reach 0, then the probability of them being projected onto the Bell states 
100) + 111) or 100) -
111) is sin2 28/2, while the probability of them being 
projected onto any of the other two Bell states is (1 + cos2 28)/2. In the 
first case (i.e when 2 and 3 get projected to 100) + 111) or 100) -
111) ), 
the distant particles 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell states 100) + 111) 
or 100) -
111). In this way in spite of amplitude errors due to propagation 
of the particles, A and B may finally share a Bell state. Of course in case 
of the other two outcomes of the state of particles 2 and 3, particles 1 and 

3.11 Applications of Entanglement Swapping 
91 
4 go to states even less entangled than that of (3.55). That is why we can 
consider entanglement swapping suitable for correction of amplitude errors 
only probabilistically. The probability of success in this case (sin2 2B /2), is 
lower than the probability of failure ((1 + cos2 2B) /2). However, from the 
outcome of the Bell-state measurement, one knows when the correction has 
been successful. This may be regarded as a kind of purification in series, in 
contrast to the standard purifications [47, 117] (see Sect. 8.2) which occur 
in parallel. It can be shown that there is a measure of entanglement which 
is conserved in this type of purification process [118] (see also Sect. 6.4 for 
measures of entanglement). 
3.11.4 Entangled States of Increasing Numbers of Particles 
Entangled states involving higher numbers of particles can be generated 
from entangled states involving lower numbers of particles by employing our 
scheme. The basic ingredients which we need are GHZ (three particle max-
imally entangled) states and a Bell state measuring device. Let us describe 
how to proceed from an N-particle maximally entangled state to an N + 1-
particle maximally entangled state. One has to take one particle from the 
N-particle maximally entangled state and another particle from a GHZ state 
and perform a Bell state measurement on these two particles. The result will 
be to put these two particles in a Bell state and the remaining N + 1 particles 
in a maximally entangled state. Symbolically, the way to proceed from an N-
particle maximally entangled state to a N + I-particle maximally entangled 
state is given by 
IE(N)) Q9IE(3)) Bell St~ Meas. IE(N + 1)) Q9IE(2)). 
An example of proceeding from a 4 particle maximally entangled state to 
a 5 particle maximally entangled state by the above procedure is shown in 
Fig.3.27. 
As far as the question of generating the GHZ state, which is a basic ingre-
dient, is concerned, one can perhaps use the method suggested by Zeilinger 
et al. [119] (see also Sect. 6.3.4 for the generation of three-photon entan-
glement) Alternatively, one can generate GHZ states using our method by 
starting from three Bell pairs and performing a GHZ state measurement, tak-
ing one particle from each pair. An explicit scheme, for producing 3-particle 
GHZ states from 3 entangled pairs was suggested earlier by Zukowski et al. 
[101].

4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
There are many ways and levels of explaining quantum computation. This 
chapter is intended to reflect this fact. It is composed of the three self-
contained sections. The first one gives a very basic introduction to the sub-
ject stressing the fundamental issues and avoiding mathematical formalism. 
Many may find this level of explanation adequate for their purposes. Those 
who want to become familiar with details are encouraged to proceed to the 
second section. It takes the reader from the very first quantum algorithms, 
through the discussion of computational complexity, to more advanced topics, 
such as quantum factoring. Last but not least, the third section provides a 
proposal for converting esoteric theoretical ideas into working devices. Chap-
ter 5 presents experimental achievements to date and continuing efforts to 
make further progress in quantum computation.

4.1.1 A New Way of Harnessing Nature 
Many milestones in the history of technology have involved the discovery 
of new ways of harnessing nature -
exploiting various physical resources 
such as materials, forces, and sources of energy. In the twentieth century 
information was added to this list when the invention of computers allowed 
complex information processing to be performed outside human brains. The 
history of computer technology has itself involved a sequence of changes from 
one type of physical realisation to another -- from gears to relays to valves 
to transistors, integrated circuits and so on. Today's advanced lithographic 
techniques can etch logic gates and wires less than a micron across onto the 
surfaces of silicon chips. Soon they will yield even smaller components, until

4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
we reach the point where logic gates are so small that they consist of only a 
few atoms each. 
On the scale of human perception and above, classical (non-quantum) 
laws of physics are good phenomenological approximations, but on the atomic 
scale the laws of quantum mechanics become dominant, and they have quite a 
different character. If computers are to continue to become faster (and there-
fore smaller), new, quantum technology must replace or supplement what we 
have now, but it turns out that such technology can offer much more than 
smaller and faster microprocessors. It can support entirely new modes of com-
putation, with new quantum algorithms that do not have classical analogues. 
And more: the quantum theory of computation plays an even more funda-
mental role in the scheme of things than its classical predecessor did, so that 
anyone seeking a fundamental understanding of either physics or information 
processing must incorporate its new insights into their world view. 
4.1.2 From Bits to QUbits 
What makes quantum computers so different from their classical counter-
parts? Let us take a closer look at the basic unit of information: the bit. 
Although bits and qubits have already been explained in Chap.I, we have 
decided, for the completeness and consistency of this exposition, to mention 
them again. 
From a physical point of view a bit is a two-state system: it can be pre-
pared in one of two distinguishable states representing two logical values ~ 
no or yes, false or true, or simply 0 or 1. For example, in digital computers, 
the voltage between the plates of a capacitor can represent a bit of informa-
tion: a charge on the capacitor denotes 1 and the absence of charge denotes 
O. One bit of information can also be encoded using, for instance, two differ-
ent polarisations of light or two different electronic states of an atom. Now, 
quantum mechanics tells us that if a bit can exist in either of two distin-
guishable states, it can also exist in coherent superpositions of them. These 
are further states, which in general have no classical analogues, in which the 
atom represents both values, 0 and 1, simultaneously. To get used to the idea 
that a physical quantity can have two values at once, it is helpful to consider 
the experiment in Fig. 4.l. 
A half-silvered mirror is one that reflects half the light that impinges upon 
it, while allowing the remaining half to pass through unaffected. Let us aim 
a single photon at such a mirror, as in Fig. 4.1. What happens? One thing 
we know is that the photon doesn't split in two: we can place photodetectors 
wherever we like in the apparatus, fire in a photon, and verify that if any 
of the photo detectors registers a hit, none of the others do. In particular, if 
we place a photodetector behind the mirror in each of the two possible exit 
beams, the photon is detected with equal probability at either detector. So 
does the photon leave the first mirror in one of the two possible directions, at 
random? It does not! It may seem obvious that at the very least, the photon

Fig. 4.1. A half-silvered mirror reflects half the light that impinges upon it. But 
a single photon doesn't split: when we send a photon towards such a mirror it is 
detected, with equal probability, either at detector A or B. This does not, however, 
mean that the photon leaves the mirror in either the horizontal (H) or the vertical 
(V) direction at random. In fact the photon takes both paths at once! This can be 
demonstrated with the help of a slightly more complicated experiment shown in 
Fig. 4.2. 
is either in the transmitted beam H or in the reflected beam V during anyone 
run of this experiment. But that is not so either. In fact the photon takes both 
paths at once, as can be demonstrated with the help of the apparatus shown 
in Fig. 4.2. Two normal mirrors are placed so that both paths intersect at a 
second half-silvered mirror. With this setup we can observe the astonishing, 
purely quantum phenomenon of single-particle interference. 
Suppose that a particular photon followed the horizontal path marked 
H in Fig. 4.2 after striking the mirror. Then (by comparison with Fig. 4.1) 
we should find that the two detectors registered hits with equal probability.

Fig. 4.2. Single-particle interference. A photon which enters the interferometer 
always strikes detector A and never detector B. Any explanation which assumes 
that the photon takes exactly one path through the interferometer -
either H or 
V -
leads to the conclusion that detectors A and B should on average each fire 
on half the occasions when the experiment is performed. But experiment shows 
otherwise. 

96 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
Exactly the same would be observed if the photon were on the vertical path 
v. Hence if it were really the case that the photon takes exactly one path 
through the apparatus -
no matter which one -
detectors A and B would 
on average each fire on half the occasions when the experiment is performed. 
However, that is not what happens. It turns out that in the arrangement 
shown, the photon always strikes detector A and never detector B. 
The inescapable conclusion is that the photon must, in some sense, have 
travelled both routes at once -
for if either of the two paths is blocked 
by an absorbing screen, it immediately becomes equally probable that A 
or B is struck. In other words, blocking off either of the paths illuminates 
B; with both paths open, the photon somehow receives information that 
prevents it from reaching B, information that travels along the other path 
at the speed of light, bouncing off the mirror, exactly as a photon would. 
This property of quantum interference -
that there seem to be invisible 
counterparts affecting the motion of particles that we detect -
applies not 
only to photons but to all particles and all physical systems. Thus quantum 
theory describes an enormously larger reality than the universe we observe 
around us. It turns out that this reality has the approximate structure of 
multiple variants of that universe, co-existing and affecting each other only 
through interference phenomena -
but for the purposes of this article, all 
we need of this "parallel universes" ontology is the fact that what we see as 
a single particle is actually only one tiny aspect of a tremendously complex 
entity, the rest of which we cannot detect directly. Quantum computation is 
all about making the invisible aspects of the particle -
its counterparts in 
other universes -
work for us.

Fig. 4.3. A sliver of glass inserted into one of the two paths in the interferometer 
can redirect photons from one detector to another. All photons that enter the left 
interferometer strike detector A. In the right interferometer, the interference is 
modified by the presence of the sliver of glass on the vertical path, and as a result 
all photons end up in detector B. Thus something that has happened on only one 
of the paths has, with certainty, changed the final outcome of the experiment. This 
effect is especially useful in quantum computation. 

4.1 Introduction to Quantum Computation 
97 
One effect that is especially useful in quantum computation can be demon-
strated if we delay the photon on one of the paths H or V. This can be done 
by inserting a sliver of glass into that path, as illustrated in Fig. 4.3. Since 
the interference between the photon and its invisible counterpart depends on 
their exact arrival times, we can, for instance, choose the thickness of the 
glass, and hence the delay time, in such a way that the photon will certainly 
(i.e. in all universes) emerge at detector B instead of detector A. Thus some-
thing that has happened on only one of the paths (and hence in only one of 
the universes) has affected both of them. We shall return to this point below. 
Just as the photon can be in a coherent superposition of being on the 
path H and on the path V, any quantum bit, or qubit, can be prepared in a 
superposition of its two logical states 0 and 1. That is the sense in which a 
qubit can store both 0 and 1 simultaneously, in arbitrary proportions. But 
note that just as the photon, if measured, will be detected on only one of the 
two paths, likewise if the qubit is measured, only one of the two numbers it 
holds will be detected, at random: not a very useful property in itself. 
But now let us push the idea of superpositions of numbers a little further. 
Consider a register composed of three physical bits. A classical 3-bit register 
can store exactly one of eight different numbers i.e the register can be in 
one of the eight possible configurations 000, 001, 010, ... , lll, representing 
the numbers 0 to 7. But a quantum register composed of three qubits can 
simultaneously store up to eight numbers in a quantum superposition. It is 
quite remarkable that eight different numbers can be physically present in the 
same register; but it should be no more surprising than the numbers 0 and 1 
both being present in the same qubit. If we add more qubits to the register 
its capacity for storing quantum information increases exponentially: four 
qubits can store 16 different numbers at once, and in general L qubits can 
store up to 2L numbers at once. A 250-qubit register -
essentially made of 
250 atoms, say -
would be capable of holding more numbers simultaneously 
than there are atoms in the known universe. (If anything, this understates the 
amount of quantum information that they hold, for in general, the elements 
of a superposition are present in continuously variable proportions, each with 
its own phase angle as well.) Even so, if we measure the register's contents, 
we will see only one of those numbers. However, now we can start doing 
some non-trivial quantum computation, for once the register is prepared in 
a superposition of many different numbers, we can perform mathematical 
operations on all of them at once. 
For example, if the qubits are atoms then suitably tuned laser pulses affect 
their electronic states and cause initial superpositions of encoded numbers to 
evolve into different superpositions. During such an evolution each number in 
the superposition is affected, so we are performing a massive parallel compu-
tation. Thus a quantum computer can in a single computational step perform 
the same mathematical operation on, say, 2L different input numbers, and 
the result will be a superposition of all the corresponding outputs. In order 

98 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
to accomplish the same task any classical computer has to repeat the compu-
tation 2L times, or has to use 2L different processors working in paralleL In 
this way a quantum computer offers an enormous gain in the use of compu-
tational resources such as time and memory -
though only in certain types 
of computation. 
4.1.3 Quantum Algorithms 
What types? As we have said, ordinary information storage is not one of them, 
for although the computer now holds all the outcomes of 2L computations, 
the laws of physics only allow us to see one of them. However, just as the 
single answer "A" in the experiment of Fig. 4.2 depends on information that 
travelled along each of two paths, quantum interference now allows us to 
obtain a single, final result that depends logically on all2L of the intermediate 
results. 
This is how a remarkable quantum algorithm recently discovered by Lov 
Grover of AT&T's Bell Laboratories in New Jersey [120] achieves the mind-
boggling feat of searching an unsorted list of N items in only /N or so 
steps. Consider, for example, searching for a specific telephone number in a 
directory containing a million entries, stored in the computer's memory in 
alphabetical order of names. It is easily proved (and obvious) that no classi-
cal algorithm can improve on the brute-force method of simply scanning the 
entries one by one until the given number is found, which will, on average, 
require 500,000 memory accesses. A quantum computer can examine all the 
entries simultaneously, in the time of a single access. However, if it is merely 
programmed to print out the result at that point, there is no improvement 
over the classical algorithm: only one of the million computational paths (i.e. 
one in a million universes) would have checked the entry we are looking for, 
so there would be a probability of only one in a million that we would obtain 
that information if we measured the computer's state. But if we leave that 
quantum information in the computer, unmeasured, a further quantum op-
eration can cause that information to affect other paths, just as in the simple 
interference experiment described above. In this way the information about 
the desired entry is spread, through quantum interference, to more universes. 
It turns out that if this interference-generating operation is repeated about 
1000 times, (in general, /N times) the information about which entry con-
tains the desired number will be accessible to measurement with probability 
0.5 -
i.e. it will have spread to more than half the universes. Therefore re-
peating the entire algorithm a few more times will find the desired entry with 
a probability overwhelmingly close to 1. 
In addition to finding the entry with a given property, variations on 
Grover's search algorithm can also find the largest or smallest value in a 
list, or the modal value, and so on, so it is a very versatile searching tooL 
However, in practice, searching a physical database is unlikely to become 
a major application of Grover's algorithm -

memory remains cheaper than quantum memory. For since the operation of 
transferring a database from classical to quantum memory (bits to qubits) 
would itself require O(N) steps, Grover's algorithm would improve search 
times by at best a constant factor, which could also be achieved by classical 
parallel processing. Where Grover's algorithm would really come into its Own 
is in algorithmic searches -
that is, searches of lists that are not stored in 
memory but are themselves generated on the fly by a computer program. 
For instance, a chess-playing quantum computer could use it to investigate 
a trillion possible continuations from a given position in roughly the num-
ber of steps that a classical computer (using blind "brute-force" searching) 
would need to investigate a mere million. Despite the greater scope for "tree-
pruning" in classical chess-playing algorithms, this is likely to provide a very 
significant improvement. 
As Gilles Brassard of the Universite de Montreal has recently pointed 
out [121], another important application of Grover's algorithm will be in 
cryptanalysis, to attack classical cryptographic schemes such as DES (the 
Data Encryption Standard, see Chap. 2 On quantum cryptography). Cracking 
DES essentially requires a search among 256 = 7 X 1016 possible keys. If these 
can be checked at a rate of, say, one million keys per second, a classical 
computer would need over a thousand years to discover the correct key while 
a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm would do it in less than four 
minutes! 
By some strange coincidence, several of the superior features of quantum 
computers have applications in cryptography. One of them is Grover's algo-
rithm. Another is the quantum algorithm discovered in 1994 by Peter Shor, 
also of AT&T's Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, for factorising large inte-
gers efficiently [36]. Here the difference in performance between the quantum 
and classical algorithms is even more spectacular. Mathematicians believe 
(firmly, though they have not actually proved it) that in order to factorise 
a number with N decimal digits, any classical computer needs a number 
of steps that grows exponentially with N: that is to say, adding One extra 
digit to the number to be factorised generally multtplies the time required 
by a fixed factor (see Sect. 4.2). Thus, as we increase the number of digits, 
the task rapidly becomes intractable. The largest number that has been fac-
torised as a mathematical challenge, i.e. a number whose factors were secretly 
chosen by mathematicians in order to present a challenge to other mathemati-
cians, had 129 digits. No One can even conceive of how One might factorise, 
say, thousand-digit numbers by classical means; the computation would take 
many times as long the estimated age of the universe. In contrast, quantum 
computers could factor thousand-digit numbers in a fraction of a second -
and the execution time would grow only as the cube of the number of digits. 
Now, the intractability of factorisation underpins the security of what 
are currently the most trusted methods of encryption, in particular of the 
RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) system, which is often used to protect 

100

electronic bank accounts [122] (for details see Chap. 2). Once a quantum fac-
torisation engine (a special-purpose quantum computer for factorising large 
numbers) is built, all such cryptographic systems will become insecure. 
The potential power of quantum phenomena to perform computations was 
first adumbrated in a talk given by Richard Feynman at the First Conference 
on the Physics of Computation, held at MIT in 1981. He observed that it 
appeared to be impossible in general to simulate the evolution of a quantum 
system on a classical computer in an efficient way [123]. The computer sim-
ulation of quantum evolution typically involves an exponential slowdown in 
time, compared with the natural evolution, essentially because the amount of 
classical information required to describe the evolving quantum state is ex-
ponentially larger than that required to describe the corresponding classical 
system with a similar accuracy. (To predict interference effects, one has to de-
scribe all the system's exponentially many counterparts in parallel universes.) 
However, instead of viewing this intractability as an obstacle, Feynman re-
garded it as an opportunity. He pointed out that if it requires that much 
computation to work out what will happen in a multi-particle interference 
experiment, then the very act of setting up such an experiment and measuring 
the outcome is equivalent to performing a complex computation. 
Quantum computation has already been used, in simple cases, to predict 
the behaviour of quantum systems. At some point in the foreseeable future, 
they will take on a new and irreplaceable role in the structure of science, 
for the ability of science to make predictions will then depend on quantum 
computation. 
The foundations of the quantum theory of computation (which must now 
be regarded as the theory of computation -
Turing's classical theory be-
ing only an approximation) were laid down in 1985 when David Deutsch 
of the University of Oxford published a crucial theoretical paper in which 
he described a universal quantum computer [124]. Since then, the hunt has 
been on for interesting things for quantum computers to do, and at the same 
time, for the scientific and technological advances that could allow us to build 
quantum computers. 
4.1.4 Building Quantum Computers 
In principle we know how to build a quantum computer; we start with sim-
ple quantum logic gates (see Chap. 1) and connect them up into quantum 
networks. 
A quantum logic gate, like a classical gate, is a very simple computing de-
vice that performs one elementary quantum operation, usually on two qubits, 
in a given time [125]. Of course, quantum logic gates differ from their classical 
counterparts in that they can create, and perform operations, on quantum su-
perpositions. However as the number of quantum gates in a network increases, 
we quickly run into some serious practical problems. The more interacting 
qubits are involved, the harder it tends to be to engineer the interaction that 

4.1 Introduction to Quantum Computation 
lOl 
would display the quantum interference. Apart from the technical difficulties 
of working at single-atom and single-photon scales, one of the most impor-
tant problems is that of preventing the surrounding environment from being 
affected by the interactions that generate quantum superpositions. The more 
components there are, the more likely it is that quantum information will 
spread outside the quantum computer and be lost into the environment, thus 
spoiling the computation. This process is called decoherence and is discussed 
in detail in Chap. 7. Thus our task is to engineer sub-microscopic systems in 
which qubits affect each other but not the environment. 
Some physicists are pessimistic about the prospects of substantial further 
progress in quantum computer technology. They believe that decoherence will 
in practice never be reduced to the point where more than a few consecutive 
quantum computational steps can be performed. (This, incidentally, would 
already allow for some very useful devices -
see Table 4.1 below.) Other, 
more optimistic researchers believe that practical quantum computers will 
appear in a matter of years rather than decades. We tend towards the op-
timistic end of the scale, partly because theory tells us that there is now 
no fundamental obstacle in the way and that quantum error correction and 
fault tolerant computation (see Chap. 7) are possible, partly thanks to the 
astonishing talents and problem-solving abilities of the experimental physi-
cists now working on this project, and partly because optimism makes things 
happen. 
However, the problems will not be solved in one fell swoop. The current 
challenge is not to build a fully-fledged universal quantum computer right 
away, but rather to move from the experiments in which we merely observe 
quantum phenomena to experiments in which we can control those phenom-
ena in the necessary ways. Simple quantum logic gates involving two qubits 
are being realised in laboratories in Europe and U.S.A. The next decade 
should bring control over several qubits and, without any doubt, we shall 
already begin to benefit from our new way of harnessing nature. It is known, 
for instance, that simple quantum networks can offer better frequency stan-
dards [126] (see Sect. 7.6). Some possible milestones in the development of 
quantum computer technology are shown in Table 4.1. 
4.1.5 Deeper Implications 
When the physics of computation was first investigated systematically in 
the 1970s, the main fear was that quantum-mechanical effects might place 
fundamental bounds on the accuracy with which physical objects could realise 
the properties of bits, logic gates, the composition of operations, and so on, 
which appear in the abstract and mathematically sophisticated theory of 
computation. Thus it was feared that the power and elegance of that theory, 
its deep concepts such as computational universality, its deep results such as 
Turing's halting theorem, and the more modern theory of complexity, might

Those fears have not only been proved groundless by the research we have 
been describing, but also, in each case, the underlying aspiration has been 
wonderfully vindicated to an extent that no one even dreamed of just twenty 
years ago. As we have explained, quantum mechanics, far from placing limits 
on what classical computations can be performed in nature, permits them all, 
and in addition provides whole new modes of computation, including algo-
rithms that perform tasks (such as perfectly secure public-key cryptography) 
that no classical computer can perform at all. As far as the elegance of the 
theory goes, researchers in the field have now become accustomed to the fact 
that the real theory of computation hangs together better, and fits in far 
more naturally with fundamental theories in other fields, than its classical 
approximation could ever have been expected to. Even at the simplest level, 
the very word "quantum" means the same as the word "bit" -
an elementary 
chunk -
and this reflects the fact that fully classical physical systems, being 
subject to the generic instability known as "chaos", would not support dig-
ital computation at all (so even Turing machines, the theoretical prototype 
of all classical computers, were secretly quantum-mechanical all along!). The 
Church-Turing hypothesis in the classical theory (that all "natural" models 
of computation are essentially equivalent to each other), was never proved. Its 

4.1 Introduction to Quantum Computation 
103 
analogue in the quantum theory of computation (the Turing Principle, that 
the universal quantum computer can simulate the behaviour of any finite 
physical system) was straightforwardly proved in Deutsch's 1985 paper [124]. 
A stronger result (also conjectured but never proved in the classical case), 
namely that such simulations can always be performed in a time that is at 
most a polynomial function of the time taken for the physical evolution, has 
since been proved in the quantum case. 
Among the many ramifications of quantum computation for apparently 
distant fields of study are its implications for both the philosophy and the 
practice of mathematical proof. Performing any computation that provides 
a definite output is tantamount to provmg that the observed output is one 
of the possible results of the given computation. Since we can describe the 
computer's operations mathematically, we can always translate such a proof 
into the proof of some mathematical theorem. This was the case classically 
too, but in the absence of interference effects it is always possible to note down 
the steps of the computation, and thereby produce a proof that satisfies the 
classical definition: a sequence of propositions each of which is either an axiom 
or follows from earlier propositions in the sequence by the standards rules of 
inference. Now we must leave that definition behind. Henceforward, a proof 
must be regarded as a process- the computation itself. not a record of all 
its steps -
for we must accept that in future, quantum computers will prove 
theorems by methods that neither a human brain nor any other arbiter will 
ever be able to check step-by-step, since if the "sequence of propositions" 
corresponding to such a proof were printed out, the paper would fill the 
observable universe many times over. A more comprehensive discussion of 
the deeper implications of quantum computation can be found in [127]. 
4.1.6 Concluding Remarks 
Experimental and theoretical research in quantum computation is now at-
tracting increasing attention from both academic researchers and industry 
worldwide. The idea that nature can be controlled and manipulated at the 
quantum level is a powerful stimulus to the imagination of physicists and 
engineers. There is almost daily progress in developing ever more promising 
technologies for realising quantum computation and new quantum algorithms 
with various advantages over their classical counterparts. There is potential 
here for truly revolutionary innovation. 
This contribution is a revised version of the introductory paper on quan-
tum computation which originally appeared in the March 1998 issue of the 
Physics World [128].

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
R. Jozsa 
4.2.1 Introduction 
A quantum algorithm is any physical process which utilises characteristically 
quantum effects to perform useful computational tasks. It is convenient to 
formalise the description of these quantum computational processes in terms 
of a model which closely parallels the formalism of classical computation. In 
essence, the memory bits of the computer are qubits rather than bits and 
the elementary operations are unitary transformations, each operating on a 
fixed finite number of qubits, rather than the Boolean operations of classical 
computation. It may be argued [124] that a model of this type suffices to 
describe any general quantum physical process. Any computer is required 
to operate by "finite means" i.e. it is equipped only with the possibility of 
applying any operation of some finite fixed set of basic unitary operations. 
Any other unitary operation that we may need in an algorithm must be built 
(or rather approximated to sufficient accuracy) out of these basic building 
blocks by concatenating their action on selected qubits. It may be shown 
[129, 130] that various quite small collections of unitary operations (so-called 
"universal sets" of operations) suffice to approximate any unitary operation 
on any number of qubits to arbitrary accuracy. 
One of the most useful and significant consequences of this formalism is 
that it provides a way of assessing the complexity of a computational task 
(again by paralleling concepts from classical computational complexity the-
ory). We will be particularly concerned with the time complexity, i.e. assessing 
the number of elementary operations required to complete a computational 
task as a function of the size of the input. 
If two computers A and B are equipped with different (universal) sets of 
basic operations then the time complexity of any computational task will in 
general be different. However, B may first program each of A's basic opera-
tions in terms of its own set and hence run any program which is written in 
terms of A's set of operations. Let k be the maximum number of steps that B 
requires to mimic anyone of A's basic operations. Then the time complexity 
on B for any computational task will be at most k times the time complexity 
relative to A, i.e. a change in the set of basic operations results in at most a 
constant slowdown (independent of input size) for any computational task. 
In computational complexity theory we are generally not interested in the 
exact number of steps in a computation but rather, only in the characteristic 
rate of growth of the number of steps with increasing input size. Indeed we 
generally only ask whether the number of steps is bounded by a polynomial 

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
105 
function of the input size (giving so-called polynomial-time algorithms or ef-
ficient algorithms) or whether it grows exponentially (or super-polynomially) 
with input size. According to the above remarks this distinction will be in-
dependent of the choice of computer and it is an intrinsic property of the 
computational task itself. 
In the study of quantum algorithms it is of paramount interest to find 
polynomial-time algorithms for problems where no classical polynomial-time 
algorithm is known, i.e. we wish to demonstrate that quantum effects may 
give rise to an exponential speedup in running time over classical informa-
tion processing. We will describe various situations in which this occurs - the 
algorithms of Deutsch, Simon and Shor. We will also describe the quantum 
searching algorithm of Grover which provides a square root speedup over any 
classical algorithm, rather than an exponential speedup. This is still of con-
siderable practical interest and Grover's algorithm also has much theoretical 
interest because of its relation to the classical complexity class called NP 
[131, 132]. 
We will see in Chap. 5 that the prospective implementation of any ex-
tended quantum algorithm currently presents a very considerable experi-
mental challenge. However the existence of interesting quantum algorithms, 
merely at the level of theoretical constructs, is of great value in itself as it 
points to new essential differences between the fundamental structure classi-
cal physics compared to quantum physics. From our point of view of informa-
tion processing, time evolution in quantum physics is seen to be intrinsically 
more complex than classical time evolution, in a way that can be quantified 
using the conceptual framework of computational complexity theory. 
The essential quantum mechanical effects giving rise to the computational 
speedup in the quantum algorithms listed above, may be traced to various 
properties of quantum entanglement. We begin by discussing two such effects 
which feature predominantly; we refer to them as "quantum parallel compu-
tation" (Sect. 4.2.2) and "the principle of local operations" (Sect. 4.2.3). 
4.2.2 Quantum Parallel Computation 
Consider a function f : A -+ B where A and B are finite sets. Typically A 
and B may be the collection of all 2n n-bit strings (for some n), as in the 
algorithms of Deutsch and Simon, or Z N, the set of integers mod N (for some 
N) as in Shor's algorithm. In our applications A and B will also be Abelian 
groups. Let HA (respectively HB) be a Hilbert space with an orthonormal 
basis labelled by the elements of A (respectively B). In the context of quan-
tum computation the computation of f corresponds to a unitary evolution 
Uf which is customarily taken as an operation on HA ® HB transforming 
I a) I b) into I a) I b EB f(a)) (c.f. Fig. 4.4). Here EB denotes the Abelian group 
operation in B. 
HA is the state space of the input register and HB is the state space of 
the output register. The input I a) is carried through to ensure that Uf is

unitary for every possible f. If b is initially set to 0 then f(a) may be read 
directly from the output register by a standard measurement in the given 
basis. 
Suppose now that the input register is set up as a superposition of values, 
say the equal superposition LaEA I a) (where we have omitted the normalisa-
tion factor). Then applying Uf with b = ° 
we get, by the linearity of quantum 
evolution, the output superposition L I a) I f(a)) (c.f. Fig. 4.5). 
By running Uf just once we have computed all values of f in superpo-
sition. This is the process of quantum parallel computation, introduced by 
Deutsch in [124]. Note that the output state L I a) I f(a)) is generally an 
entangled state of the input and output registers. Indeed the phenomenon 
of superposition is a feature also of classzcal linear systems and any effect 
depending on superposition alone can readily be implemented in a classical 
system. However the phenomenon of quantum entanglement has no classical 
analogue and its fundamental role in quantum computation has been empha-
sised and elaborated in [133, 134]. 
Let B = {O, I} denote the additive group of integers mod 2 and denote 
by B the Hilbert space of one qubit i.e. a two dimensional Hilbert space 
equipped with a standard basis denoted by {10) ,II)}. Bn will denote the 2n_

Thus 
HIO;= ~(IO;+ll;) and Hll;= ~(IO;-Il;). 
(4.2) 
Consider a function f : Bn -+ B. As an example of computation by 
quantum parallelism, we may set up a superposition of all input values and 
compute all values of f in superposition as follows: 
(i) Start with the standard state 10; ... 10; of n (input) qubits and apply H 
separately to each qubit. This will result in the state:

the state:

In = 2n/2 L I x; I f(x); . 
xEBn 
(4.4) 
Note that (i) requires only O(n) operations, which is polynomial in n, yet it 
leads to a superposition of exponentially many values of f in (4.4). 
Quantum entanglement also plays another important role in the repre-
sentation of superpositions. If we wish to build a general superposition of 
2n modes classically, we would need a smgle system capable of supporting 
each mode, e.g. 2n modes of vibration of a vibrating string. These modes will 
correspond to higher and higher levels of some physical resource, e.g. energy 
in the vibrating string, and a general superposition of 2n modes would then 
require an exponential (in n) amount of the physical resource to represent 
it. In contrast, in quantum theory, we can represent a superposition of 2n 
states using n 2-level systems - because of the phenomenon of entanglement. 
A general such superposition now requires only a linear amount of physical 
resources to represent it, since at most each of the n systems needs to be sep-
arately excited. Hence, although superposition occurs in classical systems, 
the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to an exponential saving of 
physical resources needed to represent large superpositions. 
4.2.3 The Principle of Local Operations 
In all computation, be it classical or quantum, the information which is being 
processed is embodied in the identity of the physical state of (part of) the 
computer. Let us compare the description of the identity of a state of n clas-
sical bits with its quantum analogue, a state of n qubits. Although n bits can 
be in anyone of exponentially many states, each state can be fully described 
by giving just n bits of information. In contrast, a general (entangled) state 
of n qubits may involve exponentially many superposition components which 

108 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
need to be listed. In this sense a quantum system can embody exponentially 
more information than its classical counterpart. This is not a consequence of 
the fact that quantum amplitudes can take a continuous range of values -
it persists even if we limit amplitudes to some simple basic set of numbers. 
For example the (n + l)-qubit state 11) in (4.4) embodies the information of 
all the exponentially many zer%ne values of the function f. Note that the 
information needed to describe an unentangled (product) state of n qubits 
grows only linearly with n, being n times the information needed to describe 
a single qubit state. 
The formalism of quantum mechanics allows the vast information con-
tent of a quantum state to be efficiently processed, at a rate that cannot 
be matched in real time by any classical means. This remarkable feature of 
quantum theory was first noted by Feynman in [123]. Suppose that we have 
a physical system of n qubits in some entangled state I 'IjJ) and we apply a 
1-qubit operation U to the first qubit. This would count as one step in a 
quantum computation (or rather a constant number of steps independent 
of n, if U needs to be fabricated from other basic operations provided by 
the computer). Consider now the classical computation corresponding to this 
processing of information in the state. I 'IjJ) may be described in components 
(relative to the product basis of the n qubits) by a" ""n where each subscript 
is 0 or I, and U is represented by a 2 x 2 unitary matrix U;. The application 
of U corresponds to the matrix multiplication 
a(new) = '"""' UJ a 
~l"'1,n 
L...J 
1,1 
)1,2" "'in' 
(4.5) 
J 
Thus the 2 x 2 matrix multiplication needs to be performed 2n - 1 times, 
once for each possible value of the string i2 ... in, requiring a computing 
effort which grows exponentially with n. On a quantum computer, because 
of entanglement, this 2n - 1 repetition is unnecessary. This is our "principle 
of local operations": a single local unitary operation on a subsystem of a 
large entangled system processes the embodied information by an amount 
which would generally require an exponential effort to represent in classical 
computational terms. 
In the sense noted above, n qubits have an exponentially larger capacity 
to represent information than n classical bits. However the potentially vast 
information embodied in a quantum state has a further remarkable feature -
most of it is inaccess~ble to being read by any possible means! Indeed quantum 
measurement theory places severe restrictions on the amount of information 
that we can obtain about the identity of a given unknown quantum state. 
This intrinsic inaccessibility of the information may be quantified [135, 136] 
in terms of Shannon's information theory [137]. In the case of a general state 
of n qubits, with its O(2n) information content, it turns out that at most n 
classical bits of information about its identity may be extracted from a single 
copy of the state by any physical means whatsoever. This coincides with the 
maximum information capacity of n classical bits. 

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
109 
The full (largely inaccessible) information content of a given unknown 
quantum state is called quantum information. Natural quantum physical evo-
lution may be thought of as the processing of quantum information. Thus the 
viewpoint of computational complexity reveals a new bizarre distinction be-
tween classical and quantum physics: to perform natural quantum physical 
evolution, Nature must process vast amounts of information at a rate that 
cannot be matched in real time by any classical means, yet at the same time, 
most of this processed information is kept hidden from us! However it is im-
portant to point out that the inherent inaccessibility of quantum information 
does not cancel out the possibility of exploiting this massive information pro-
cessing capability for useful computational purposes. Indeed, small amounts 
of information may be extracted about the overall identity of the final state 
which would still require an exponential effort to obtain by classical means. 
The technique of quantum parallel computation described above, provides an 
example: the full quantum information of the state 11) in (4.4) incorporates 
the information of all the individual function values f(x) but this is not acces-
sible to any measurement. However certain global properties of the collection 
of all the function values may be determined by suitable measurements on 
11) which are not diagonal in the standard basis {I x) I y)}. For example, if f 
is a periodic function, we may determine the value of the period which falls 
far short of characterising the individual function values but would generally 
still require an exponential number of function evaluations to obtain reliably 
by classical means. This will be a key fact in the workings of Shor's efficient 
quantum factoring algorithm (Sect. 4.2.6). 
Having discussed some basic computational benefits of quantum theory 
in general terms we will now describe the workings of various fundamental 
quantum algorithms. 
4.2.4 Oracles and Deutsch's Algorithm 
Deutsch's algorithm [124, 138] was the first explicit example of a compu-
tational task which could be performed exponentially faster using quantum 
effects than by any classical means. It was subsequently improved in [139] 
and we will describe here its most up-to-date form. 
Consider first the four possible one-bit functions f : B ---* B. We have two 
constant functions: 
f(O) = 0 
f(l) = 0 
or 
f(O) = 1 
f(l) = 1 
(4.6) 
and two "balanced" functions (balanced in the sense that the output values 
o and 1 occur equally often): 
f(O) = 0 
f(l) = 1 
or 
f(O) = 1 
f(l)=O' 
(4.7) 

110 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
Suppose now that we are given a "black box" or "oracle" which computes 
an (unknown) one of these functions. The oracle may be pictured as a sealed 
box (c.f. Fig. 4.4) providing the value of the function for any given input 
value (or input superposition as in Fig. 4.5). Alternatively we may think 
of the oracle as a computer subroutine which we may run but whose text 
or internal workings we are not allowed to examine. (Later we will give a 
discussion of the significance of this limitation on our access to the evaluation 
of f.) Our problem is to determine whether the function computed by the 
oracle is balanced or constant. 
In the context of classical computation we clearly need to query the oracle 
twice to solve the problem with certainty. Indeed if we know only one value 
of the function (i.e. either 1(0) or 1(1)) then we have no information at all 
about whether the function is balanced or constant! We will now show that 
on a quantum computer the problem may be solved with certainty with just 
one query to the oracle. 
We exploit the possibility of quantum parallel computation (as described 
above) but with an extra twist - of first setting the output register to ~ (I 0) ~ 
11)). The quantum computation runs as follows. Starting from the standard 
state I 0) I 0) of the input and output registers we apply the NOT operation 
to the output and then H to both registers giving

O)~ 1)) 
(4.8) 
Next we present this state to the oracle, i.e. we apply Uf. Recalling that Uf 
transforms I x) I y) into I x) I y EEl l(x)) we see that 
{
Ix) (I 0) ~ 11)) if 1 (x) = 0 
U f : Ix) (I 0) ~ 11)) ----+ 
~ I x) (I 0) ~ 11)) if 1 (x) = 1 
Thus 
Uf: ~~lx)CO)~11)) ----+ (~~(~l)f(X)IX)) CO)~11)). 
(4.9) 
Throughout this process the output register has remained in state ~ (I 0) ~ 
11)). The input register is left in state ~ I:xEB( ~l)f(x) I x). If 1 is a constant 
function we get ± ~(I 0) + 11)) and if 1 is balanced we get ± ~(I 0) ~ 11)). 
Now it is easy to verify directly that H is its own inverse, i.e. that H H = I. 
Thus finally applying H to the input register (and noting (4.2)) the state of 
this register will be ± I 0) if 1 was constant and ± 11) if 1 was balanced. These 
may be reliably distinguished by a measurement in the standard basis, thus 
distinguishing balanced from constant functions with certainty after just one

tively 1) signals that f is constant (respectively balanced). 
query to the oracle. The overall sequence of operations is summarised in the 
network diagram shown in Fig. 4.6. 
The above distinction between one and two calls to the oracle has no 
direct significance for formal complexity considerations but we may readily 
generalise the idea of the above process to a situation which does exhibit an 
exponential separation between the classical and quantum solutions. 
Instead of having functions from one bit to one bit suppose we are given 
an oracle which computes some function from n bits to one bit: 
(and we also know the value of n). It is promised that the function is either 
constant (i.e. the 2n values are either all 0 or all 1) or balanced, where bal-
anced means that exactly half (i.e. 2n - 1 ) of the values are 0 and half are 
1. Note that for n > 1 a general function from n bits to 1 bit is neither 
balanced nor constant but there are a large number of possible balanced 
functions. Our problem is again to determine (with certainty) whether j is 
balanced or constant. The case of n = 1 is precisely the problem considered 
previously. 
In a classical scenario, if we query the oracle 2n - 1 times to obtain 2n - 1 
values of j, in any way whatever with later queries possibly depending on the 
outcome of earlier ones, then we will still not be able to solve the problem 
in every case. Indeed suppose that the 2n - 1 values come out to be all the 
same (which is always possible although very unlikely if the function is really 
balanced). Then regardless of the choice of input arguments there will always 
be a constant and a balanced function which is consistent with the totality 
of the information gained. Hence any classical solution to the problem must 
query the oracle more than 2n - 1 times i.e. at least an exponential (in n) 
number of times. In fact it is easy to see that 2n - 1 + 1 queries will always 
suffice. In a quantum scenario the problem may be solved with certainty in 
every case with just one call to the oracle. The method is a straightforward 
generalisation of the one bit case. 
We start with a row of n (input) qubits and one (output) qubit all in 
standard state 10). We apply H to each of the input qubits. As given in (4.3) 
this results in an equal superposition of all inputs in the first n qubits. We 
prepare the last (output) qubit in state ~(I 0) -11)) exactly as previously. 

112 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
Next we offer the resulting n + 1 qubit state to the oracle. This is formally 
the same as (4.9) except that now x ranges over B n rather than just B. After 
processing by the oracle the first n qubits will be in state 
(4.10) 
(In passing we note here that in the original 1992 version of the Deutsch 
algorithm [138] the output register was initialised in state 10; and two calls 
to the oracle were needed to produce the state I ~f;). Now if f was a constant 
function then I ~f; will be just an equal superposition of all the I x;'s with an 
overall plus or minus sign whereas if f was a balanced function then I ~f; will 
be an equally weighted superposition with exactly half of the I x;'s having 
minus signs. Thus these two possibilities are orthogonal and so there exists a 
suitable measurement on I ~f; which will distinguish balanced from constant 
functions with certainty. 
We need to describe explicitly how this measurement can be performed. 
In any quantum algorithm we cannot assume that any measurement can be 
performed by fiat as one step of computation (just as we cannot assume 
the application of complicated unitary operations as one step). To assess the 
complexity of any measurement we assume that the only possible measure-
ment available to us is an elementary 10; versus II; measurement of anyone 
qubit in the computational basis and this counts as one step. Any general 
measurement may be reduced to a sequence of these standard measurements 
by first unitarily rotating the eigenbasis of the measurement into the compu-
tational basis and then successively reading the bits. The complexity of the 
measurement is then measured by the number of steps required to implement 
this unitary rotation plus the number of qubits that need to be read. 
In our case the measurement that distinguishes balanced from constant 
I ~f; 's may be implemented simply as follows. Recalling that H is its own 
inverse (i.e. H H = I) and that H applied to each qubit of 10; 10; ... 10; 
results in an equal superposition of all I xl's (c.f. (4.3)), it follows that if H 
is again applied to each qubit of this equal superposition then the resulting 
state will be 10; 10; ... 10;. Hence we apply H to each qubit of I ~f; (involv-
ing n steps). If f was constant then the resulting state is ± I 0; 10; ... 10;. 
If f was balanced then the resulting state will be orthogonal to this i.e. a 
superposition of I x; 's with x i- 00 ... O. Thus we read each of the n qubits to 
see if they are all 0 or not (a further n steps) which completes the measure-
ment. Overall, Deutsch's quantum algorithm requires O(n) steps (including 
one call to the oracle) to distinguish balanced from constant functions with 
certainty whereas any classical algorithm requires 0(2n) steps to achieve the 
same task. 
Deutsch's algorithm is a so-called "oracle result" or "relativised" separa-
tion result (relative to an oracle). It does not provide an absolute exponential 
separation between quantum and classical computation but gives this sepa-

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
113 
ration only if we make some further (plausible but unproven) computational 
assumptions related to the fact that we are forbidden access to the internal 
workings of the oracle. In effect we have assumed that, if we are given a pro-
gram which computes f, there is no mechanical way of using the syntax of a 
general such program to determine whether f is constant or balanced, more 
quickly than by just running the program a sufficient number of times. Of 
course, a constant function for example, may have a very short program which 
may be recognised immediately as computing a constant function but an ad-
versary may also provide a very complicated disguised program which still 
computes a constant function, and this may be very hard to see by reading 
the syntax. Although this assumption is very plausible it remains unproven 
as it is very difficult to analyse algorithms which operate on the syntax of a 
program as input! We remark that if an absolute exponential separation be-
tween classical and quantum computation could be proved it would resolve 
some long standing fundamental open questions in classical complexity the-
ory (e.g. it would imply that P =I- P S P ACE; see [131] for a definition of these 
terms). Thus it is likely to be very difficult to formally prove that quantum 
computation is exponentially more powerful than classical computation. 
Another significant feature of Deutsch's algorithm is that if the algorithm 
is not required to work perfectly, i.e. if we tolerate some (arbitrarily small) 
error in the answer, then the displayed exponential separation between clas-
sical and quantum computation collapses. Indeed given any E > 0 there is 
a classical (probabilistic) algorithm running for a constant number of steps 
(independent of n!), which will distinguish balanced from constant functions, 
providing an answer that is correct with probability (1 - f) for any given 
choice of f. This algorithm runs simply as follows. We evaluate f on some K 
randomly chosen inputs. If the answers are all the same then f is deemed to 
be constant. Otherwise it is deemed to be balanced. A little thought shows 
that the answer 'balanced' is always correct and the answer 'constant' will 
be correct with probability of error less than 1/2K. Thus for any given E > 0 
we choose K large enough to have 2~ < E. Note that K is independent of n 
so the K evaluations count as a constant number of steps in the algorithm. 
It is only in the limiting case of E = 0 that the exponential separation 
between quantum and classical computation occurs. One may argue that 
this limiting situation is actually unphysical because any computer, being a 
physical device, can never be perfectly isolated from its environment. Thus it 
always has some (generally very small) probability of functioning incorrectly, 
e.g. a memory bit may be flipped by a cosmic ray at any time. Hence it is of 
great interest to exhibit a computational task whose computational complex-
ity separates quantum from classical computation by an exponential amount 
even if a small error in the result is tolerated. The first such example was 
given by Bernstein and Vazirani [140]. Using a recursive construction they 
described a computational task involving an oracle which could be solved 
on a quantum computer in polynomial time but which required O(nlogn) 

114 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
time on a classical computer. Then Simon [141] described a simpler oracle 
problem which could be solved in O(n2 ) time on a quantum computer but 
required fully exponential time (i.e. O(2n) time) on a classical computer. 
The apotheosis of this line of development was the algorithm of Shor [36] for 
factorisation which also eliminated the dependence on an oracle. Shor's al-
gorithm provides a method for factorising an integer N in a number of steps 
which is polynomial (less than cubic) in the number of digits (log N) of N 
and returns a correct result with probability 1 -
E for any prescribed E > o. 
Despite a great deal of effort for some hundreds of years (by eminent math-
ematicians such as Gauss, Legendre, Fermat and others) there is no known 
classlcal probabilistic polynomial time algorithm for this problem. Unlike the 
algorithms of Deutsch and Simon, Shor's algorithm does not involve an ora-
cle. However this does not provide a proof of an absolute exponential benefit 
of quantum computation over classical computation because there is also no 
known proof that a classical polynomial time factoring algorithm does not 
exist (only an immense wealth of unsuccessful attempts at constructing such 
an algorithm!) 
4.2.5 The Fourier Transform and Periodicities 
Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and Simon's algorithm will depend in 
an essential way on a quantum computer's remarkable ability to efficiently 
determine the periodicity of a given periodic function. We illustrate the ideas 
involved with the following basic example. Suppose that we have a black box 
which computes a function f : ZN --t Z that is guaranteed to be periodic 
with some period r: 
f(x + r) = f(x) 
for all x. 
(4.11) 
Recall that ZN denotes the group of integers modulo N and addition here is 
modulo N. We also assume that f does not take the same value twice within 
any single period. Note that (4.11) can hold only if r divides N exactly. 
Our aim is to determine r. Classically (in the absence of any further 
information about f) we can merely try different values of x in the black 
box hoping for two equal results which will then give information about r. 
Generally we will require O(N) random tries to hit two equal values with 
high probability. Using quantum effects we will be able to find r using only 
o ((log N)2) steps, which represents an exponential speedup over any classical 
algorithm. 
We begin by using quantum parallel computation to compute all values 
of f in equal superposition, resulting in the state 
1 N-l

and (b) its Fourier transform. In passing to:F I 'IjJ) the periodicity r has been inverted 
to N I r and the random shift Xo has been eliminated. 
Although this state embodies the periodicity of f it is not immediately clear 
how to extract the information of r! If we measure the value in the second 
register, giving a value Yo say, then the state of the first register will be 
reduced to an equal superposition of all those I Xl'S such that f(x) = Yo. If 
Xo is the least such x and N = K r then we will obtain in the first register 
the periodic state 
1 K-l 
Iw) = 
IV L I Xo + kr) .

( 4.13) 
It is important to note here that 0 ::; Xo ::; r-l has been generated at random, 
corresponding to having seen any value Yo of f with equal probability. So if we 
now measure the value in this register, the overall result is merely to produce 
a number between 0 and N - 1 uniformly at random, giving no information 
at all about the value of r! 
The resolution of this difficulty is to use the Fourier transform which, even 
for classical data, is known to be able to pick out periodic patterns in a set 
of data regardless of how the whole pattern is shifted. The discrete Fourier 
transform F for integers modulo N is the N by N unitary matrix with entries

The important point to note here is that the random shift Xo no longer 
appears in the ket labels (see Fig. 4.7). 
If we now read the label we will obtain a value c say, which is necessarily 
a multiple of Nlr, i.e. c = ANI" . Thus we can write 
c 
N 
r 
( 4.16) 

116 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
where c and N are known numbers and and 0 :::; A :::; r - 1 has been chosen 
uniformly at random by the measurement (as all amplitudes in F I 'l/J; have 
equal size.) Now if the randomly chosen A is fortuitously coprime to r (i.e. 
A and r have no common factors) we can determine r by cancelling c/N 
down to an irreducible fraction. What is the probability that a randomly 
chosen r actually ~s coprime to r? According to the prime number theorem 
(c.f. [142, 143] and appendix A of [144]), the number of prime numbers less 
than or equal to r goes as r / log r for large r. Thus the probability that our 
randomly chosen A is coprime to r is at least 1/ log r which exceeds 1/ log N. 
Hence if we repeat the above procedure o (log N) times we can succeed in 
determining r with any prescribed probability 1 -
E as close to 1 as desired. 
We noted above that we want our quantum algorithm for determining 
r to run in time poly (log N), i.e. in a number of steps which is polynomial 
in log N rather than N itself, to achieve an exponential speed up over any 
known classical algorithm for determining periodicity. We showed above that 
O(log N) repetitions suffice to determine r but there is still a significant gap 
in our argument: the Fourier transform F that we used is a large non-trivial 
unitary operation, of size N x N, and we cannot ab initio just assume that it 
can be implemented using only poly (log N) basic computational operations. 
Indeed it may be shown that any d x d unitary operation may be implemented 
on a quantum computer (equipped with any universal set of operations) in 
O(d2 ) steps [124, 144]. This is also the number of steps needed for the classical 
computation of multiplying a d x d matrix into a d dimensional column vector. 
For our use of F this bound of O(N2) does not suffice. Fortunately the Fourier 
transform has extra special properties which enable it to be implemented in 
o ((log N)2) steps. These properties stem from the classical theory of the fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) [145] which shows how to reduce the O(N2) steps 
of classical matrix multiplication to O(N log N) steps. If the same ideas are 
implemented in a quantum setting then the principle of local operations may 
be seen [134, 144] to reduce the number of steps to O( (log N)2) giving our 
desired implementation. Having made this important point we will omit the 
considerable technical details of the FFT construction and its implementation 
in a quantum setting. These details are elaborated in [134] to which we refer 
the interested reader. Note also that according to (4.14) we have 
1 N-l 
FlO; = Vn ~ Ix;, 
( 4.17) 
so that once we have an efficient implementation of F we will be able to 
efficiently produce the uniform large superposition necessary to get I n in 
(4.12). 
In summary, the quantum algorithm for determining the periodicity of a 
given function f, with N inputs, begins with an application of quantum par-
allel computation to compute all values of f in superposition using o (log N) 
steps. The the Fourier transform is applied to pick out the periodic struc-

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
117 
ture of the resulting state. The principle of local operations applied to the 
quantum implementation of the FFT algorithm guarantees that the Fourier 
transform may be implemented in poly (log N) steps. An analogous classical 
computation would require O(N) invocations of f to compute a column vec-
tor of all the function values and then O(N log N) steps to perform the FFT. 
Thus the quantum algorithm represents an exponential speedup. 
It is interesting to observe that the concept of periodicity and the con-
struction of the Fourier transform may be extended to apply to any finite 
group G. Our discussion above pertains simply to the special case of the 
additive group of integers modulo N. The generalised viewpoint provides 
considerable insight into the workings of the Fourier transform. We will now 
briefly outline some of the essential ideas involved, restricting attention to the 
case of finite Abelian groups. (The remainder of this section may be omitted, 
if desired, without any loss of continuity with the following sections.) 
Let G be any finite Abelian group. Let f : G -+ X be a function on the 
group (taking values in some set X) and consider 
K = {k E G : f(k + g) = f(g) for all g E G}. 
(4.18) 
(Note that we write the group operation in additive notation). K is necessarily 
a subgroup of G called the stabiliser or symmetry group of f. It characterises 
the periodicity of f with respect to the group operation of G. In our previous 
example G was ZN and K was the cyclic subgroup of all multiples of T. Given 
a device that computes f, our aim is to determine K. More precisely we wish 
to determine K in time O(poly(log IGI)) where IGI is the size of the group and 
the evaluation of f on an input counts as one computational step. (Note that 
we may easily determine K in time O(poly(IGI)) by simply evaluating and 
examining all the values of f). We begin as in our example by constructing 
the state 
1 
If) = JiG! ~ 
I g) I f(g) 
(4.19) 
and read the second register. Assuming that f is suitably non-degenerate -
in the sense that f(gd = f(g2) iff gl - g2 E K, i.e. that f is one-to-one within 
each period - we will obtain in the first register 
1 
I 1/1 (go) = JlKT ~ 
I go + k) , 
(4.20) 
corresponding to seeing f (go) in the second register and go has been chosen 
at random. In (4.20) we have an equal superposition of labels corresponding 
to a randomly chosen coset of K in G. Now G is the disjoint union of all the 
cosets so that if we read the label in (4.20) we will see a random element of 
a random coset, i.e. a label chosen equiprobably from all of G, yielding no 
information at all about K. 

118 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
The general construction of a "Fourier transform on G" will provide a way 
of eliminating go from the labels (just as in our example) and the resulting 
state will then provide direct information about K. Let 1i be a Hilbert space 
with a basis {I g) : g E G} labelled by the elements of G. Each group element 
gl E G gives rise to a unitary "shifting" operator U (gl) on 1i defined by 
for all g. 
(4.21 ) 
Note that the state in (4.20) may be written as a go-shifted state: 
L: I go + k) = U(go) (L: I k)) . 
kEK 
kEK 
(4.22) 
Our basic idea now is to introduce into 1i a new basis {I Xg) : g E G} of 
special states which are shift-invariant in the sense that 
( 4.23) 
i.e. the I Xg) 's are the common eigenstates of all the shifting operations U (g). 
Note that the U(g)'s all commute so such a basis of common eigenstates is 
guaranteed to exist. Then according to (4.22) if we view I'l/J(go)) in the new 
basis then LkEK I k) and LkEK I go + k) will contain the same pattern of 
labels, determined by the subgroup K only. Reading the label in the new 
basis will then directly provide information about the constituent elements 
of K. 
The Fourier transform :F on G is defined to simply be the unitary trans-
formation which takes the shift-invariant basis back to the standard basis: 
for all g. 
(4.24) 
Hence to read I'l/J(go)) in the new basis we just apply :F and read in the 
standard basis. 
To give an explicit construction of F it suffices to give the states I Xg) 
written as components in the standard basis. There is a standard way of 
calculating these components based on constructions from group representa-
tion theory. We omit the details here but the interested reader will find an 
introduction in [134] and [146]. For the group ZN we get

leading to the Fourier transform formula given in (4.14). 
(4.25) 
The above group-theoretic framework serves to generalise and extend the 
applicability of the quantum algorithm for periodicity determination. For 
example, Simon's quantum algorithm [134, 141, 146, 147] turns out to be 
just a periodicity determination on the group (Z2)n, the group of all n-bit 

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
119 
strings with componentwise addition modulo 2. Simon considered the follow-
ing problem: suppose that we have a black box which computes a function 
f from n-bit strings to n-bit strings. It is also promised that the function is 
"two-to-one" in the sense that there is a fixed n-bit string ~ such that 
f(x +~) = f(x) 
for all n-bit strings x. 
(4.26) 
Our problem is to determine ~. 
To see that this is just a generalised periodicity determination, note that 
in the group (Z2)n of n-bit strings, every element satisfies x + x = O. Hence 
(4.26) states just that f is periodic on the group with periodicity subgroup 
K = {O, O. Thus to determine ~ we construct the Fourier transform on the 
group of n-bit strings and apply the standard algorithm above. The relevant 
Hilbert space 1-£ with a basis labelled by n-bit strings is just a row of n 
qubits. Using the general constructions of group representation theory, the 
Fourier transform may be seen [134] to be the application of H (from (4.1)) 
to each of the n qubits. The quantum algorithm determines ~ in O(n2 ) steps 
whereas it may be argued [141] that any classical algorithm must evaluate 
f at least O(2n) times. A full description of the algorithm may be found in 
[141, 146, 147]. 
The Fourier transform formalism has emerged as the most important in-
gredient in the quantum algorithms discovered so far. Some interesting fur-
ther developments of it, including the extension to non-Abelian groups, may 
be found in [148, 149]. 
4.2.6 Shor's Quantum Algorithm for Factorisation 
The most celebrated quantum algorithm devised to date is Shor's efficient 
algorithm for factorisation [36, 144, 146]. Given a number N we wish to de-
termine a number k (not equal to 1 or N) which divides N exactly. In this 
section we will outline how this problem may be reduced to a problem of pe-
riodicity determination for a suitable periodic function f. Then the quantum 
algorithm described in the preceding section will achieve the factorisation of 
N in poly (log N) time, i.e. polynomial in the number of digits of N. 
We note first that there is no known classical algorithm which will factorise 
any given N in a time polynomial in the number of digits of N. For example 
the most naive factoring algorithm involves test-dividing N by each number 
from 1 to VR (as any composite N must have a factor in this range). This 
requires at least VR steps (at least one step for each trial factor) and VR = 
2~ log N is exponential in log N. In fact using all the ingenuity of modern 
mathematics, the fastest known classical factoring algorithm runs in a time 
of order exp( (log N)! (log log N) ~). 
To reduce the problem of factoring N to a problem of periodicity we 
will need to use some basic results from number theory. These are further 
described in the appendix of [144] and complete expositions may be found 

120 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
in most standard texts on number theory such as [142, 143]. We begin by 
selecting a number a < N at random. Using Euclid's algorithm, we compute 
in poly(log N) time, the highest common factor of a and N. If this is larger 
than 1, we will have found a factor of N and we are finished! However it 
is overwhelmingly likely that a randomly chosen a will be coprime to N. 
The prime number theorem (mentioned in the last section) implies that this 
probability will be exceed 1/ log N for large N. If a is coprime to N, then 
Euler's theorem of number theory guarantees that there is a power of a which 
has remainder 1 when divided by N. Let r be the smallest such power: 
aT == 1 mod N 
and r is the least such power. 
( 4.27) 
(If a is not coprime to N, then no power of a has remainder 1). r is called the 
order of a modulo N. Next we show that the information of r can provide a 
factor of N. 
Suppose that we have a method for determining r (see below) and suppose 
further that r comes out to be an even number. Then we can rewrite (4.27) 
as aT - 1 == 0 mod Nand factorise as a difference of squares: 
(a T / 2 - 1)(aT / 2 + 1) == 0 mod N. 
(4.28) 
Let a = aT / 2 -
1 and {3 = aT / 2 + 1. Then N exactly divides the product a{3. 
If neither a nor {3 is a multiple of N then N must divide partly into a and 
partly into {3. Thus computing the highest common factor of N with a and 
{3 (again using Euclid's algorithm) will generate a non-trivial factor of N. 
As an example take N = 15 and choose the coprime number a = 7. 
By computing the powers of 7 modulo 15 we find that 74 == 1 mod 15, i.e. 
the order of 7 modulo 15 is 4. Thus 15 must exactly divide the product 
(74/ 2 _1)(74/ 2 + 1) = (48)(50). Computing the highest common factor of 15 
with 50 and 48 gives 5 and 3 respectively, which are indeed nontrivial factors 
of 15. 
Our method will give a factor of N provided that r comes out to be even 
and that neither of (a T / 2 ± 1) are exact multiples of N. To guarantee that 
these conditions occur often enough (for randomly chosen a's) we have 
Theorem: Let N be odd and suppose that a < N coprime to N is chosen 
at random. Let r be the order of a modulo N. Then the probability that r is 
even and aT / 2 ± 1 are not exact multiples of N is always ?: ~. D 
The (somewhat lengthy) proof of this theorem may be found in appendix B 
of [144], to which we refer the reader for details. 
Overall, our method will produce a factor of N with probability at least 
half in every case. This success probability may be amplified as close as de-
sired to 1, since K repetitions ofthe procedure (with K constant independent 
of N) will succeed in factorising N with probability exceeding 1 -
~. 
All steps in the procedure, such as applying Euclid's algorithm and the 
arithmetic manipulation of numbers, can be done in poly (log N) time. The 

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
121 
only remammg outstanding ingredient is a method for determining r in 
poly (log N) time. Consider the exponential function: 
f(x) = aX modN. 
( 4.29) 
Now (4.27) says precisely that f is periodic with period r, i.e. that f(x+r) 
= f(x). Thus we use the quantum algorithm for periodicity determination, 
described in the previous section, to find r. To apply the algorithm as stated, 
we need to restrict the scope of x values in (4.29) to a finite range 0 ::; x ::; q 
for some q. If q is not an exact multiple of (the unknown) r, i.e. q = Ar + t 
for some 0 < t < r, then the resulting function will not be exactly periodic -
the single final period over the last t values will be incomplete. However if q 
is chosen large enough, giving sufficiently many intact periods of f, then the 
single corrupted period will have negligible effect on the use of the q x q Fourier 
transform to determine r, as we might intuitively expect. In fact it may be 
shown that if q is chosen to have size O(N2) then we get a reliable efficient 
determination of r. For the technical analysis of this imperfect periodicity 
(involving the theory of continued fractions) we refer the reader to [36, 144]. 
q is also generally chosen to be a power of 2 which fits in particularly well 
with the formalism of fast Fourier transforms (c.f. [134, 145]). 
4.2.7 Quantum Searching and NP 
Suppose that we have a database consisting of an unsorted unstructured list 
of N records and at most one of the records satisfies a given property of inter-
est. We want to locate the special record. Any classical method which locates 
the record with some constant probability (independent of N) will require 
O(N) steps. Indeed elementary probability theory shows that if we examine 
k of the records then we have probability k / N of finding the special record. 
This probability tends to 0 with increasing N unless k is at least of order 
N. Grover's quantum searching algorithm [120, 150] solves the problem with 
only O( VN) steps. Thus quantum effects can provide a square root speedup 
in this problem which should be contrasted to the much greater exponen-
tial speedup exhibited by the previously discussed quantum algorithms. In 
Grover's algorithm we will require the ability to examine different records in 
superposition just as our previous algorithms evaluated functions on super-
positions of input values. 
The assumption of unstructuredness of the database is very important 
for the result. For example if the database consisted of N random numbers 
which are sorted in ascending order then we would need only o (log N) steps 
classically (using a standard bisection method) to locate any given one of 
the numbers. Similarly any prior known structure of the database might 
be exploited to reduce the search time. The unstructuredness assumption 
is analogous to our previous use of oracles (or black boxes) whose internal 
structure we were unable to access. In fact the database searching problem

Fig. 4.8. The construction of Ixo from Ufo Here f is the oracle which marks Xo. 
may be more accurately re-phrased in terms of an oracle as follows: we are 
given a black box which computes a function of N inputs, with output values 
o or 1. Furthermore it is promised that f (x) = 1 for exactly one input value 
Xo (all other values of f being 0). Our task is to find Xo. 
We will now outline Grover's quantum searching algorithm for finding Xo 
in O( VN) steps. (The following technical details may be omitted if preferred 
at first reading, without essential loss of continuity, noting the features of 
the algorithm already described above.) As in our discussion of Deutsch's 
algorithm and quantum parallel computation, we will assume that the or-
acle is given as a unitary transformation Uf which transforms I x) I j) into 
I x) I j EEl f(x)). Here 1 -s: x -s: N, j = 0 or 1 and EEl is addition modulo 2. It 
will also be convenient to restrict attention to the case where N = 2n i.e. 
N is a power of 2 so that f is a function from n bits to one bit. Let sn be 
the Hilbert space of n qubits (i.e. the input register) with a standard basis 
{I x)} labelled by all n-bit strings X. The original form of Grover's algorithm 
is based on two unitary operations Ixo and D, each acting on sn. Ixo is the 
operation which merely inverts the amplitude of I xo): 
I 
I x) = { 
I x) if x f Xo 
Xo 
_ Ix) if x = Xo 
( 4.30) 
This is easily constructed from Uf by first setting its output register (the last 
of n + 1 qubits) to ~ (10) - 11)) just as we did in Deutsch's algorithm. The 
action of Uf then effects Ixo on the input register while leaving the output 
register in state ~(I 0) -11)) (see Fig. 4.8). 
The operator D is defined as follows. Let Hn be the application of H (c.f. 
(4.1)) to each of the n qubits and let 10 be the operator Ixo with x = 00 ... O. 
Then D is defined by 
(4.31 ) 
A direct computation of the matrix elements of D [120, 150] shows that all 
off-diagonal elements are it and all diagonal elements are -1 + it (recalling 
that N = 2n here). Hence

4.2 Quantum Algorithms

D has a simple geometrical interpretation as being "inversion about the 
mean". For any state I1/;) 
= I: ax I x) let D I1/;) 
= I: a~ I x) and let 
a = il I: ax denote the average amplitude for the state 11/;). Using (4.32) 
we get 
2 
a~ = -ax + N 2:= ay = a - (ax - a) . 
( 4.33) 
y 
Writing Llax = ax - a we have that ax = a + Llax and a~ = a - Llax so that 
the values of the amplitudes are just reflected in the mean a. 
To perform Grover's algorithm we begin with an equal superposition 
11/;0) = J-N I: I x) which may be prepared, for example, by applying Hn 
to 10 ... 0). This state corresponds to examining the database at all positions 
in equal superposition. Our aim is to modify 11/;0) to concentrate the ampli-
tude at x = Xo. The algorithm consists of repeatedly applying the operator 
Dlxo giving a sequence of states l1/;k): 
(4.34) 
Using our expressions for D and Ixo it is easy to see that the amplitudes of 
all Ix) 's with x i- Xo remain equal to each other so that each l1/;k) has the 
form 
l1/;k) = Ok 2:= I x) + fJk I xo) , 
(4.35) 
xolxo 
where Ok and fJk are also real. Using the matrix elements of D and Ixo we 
can derive the recurrence relations: 
00 = fJo = J-N 
Ok+1 = (1 - t" )Ok - t"fJk 
fJk+1 = (1- t,,)fJk + (N -l)t"ok. 
Normalisation gives 
fJ~ + (N - 1)0% = 1, 
( 4.36) 
( 4.37) 
which suggests that we write Ok = v' ~ -1 cos (h and fJk = sin Ok. It is then 
straightforward to verify [151] that the recurrence relations in (4.36) are 
satisfied by 
1 
Ok = ~ 
cos(2k + 1)0, 
N-1 
fJk = sin(2k + 1)0, 
where 0 is the angle given by sin 0 = J-N. 
( 4.38) 

124 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
Thus fA varies sinusoidally with the number of iterations k. We will have 
13k = 1 if (2k+ l)B = 7r /2 i.e. if k = 7["4;0. For large N, we have sin B = IN ~ B 
and then k = iVN -
~ which is of order VN. Thus if we iterate the process 
for a number of steps given by the whole number nearest to this value of 
k, then Xo may be obtained with a high probability (independent of N) by 
reading the final state in the standard basis (c.f. [151] for a further analysis 
of the probabilities involved.) This completes the algorithm. 
Since Grover's original work, the basic ideas involved in the above algo-
rithm have been extended to a variety of further applications such as esti-
mating the mean and median of a database of N given numbers [152] and the 
analysis of the case of more than one marked item in a database [151, 153]. 
Using an ingenious combination of Grover's algorithm and Shor's algorithm, 
Brassard, Hoyer and Tapp have shown [153] that it is also possible to esti-
mate the number of such marked items (rather than locating their positions). 
The underlying idea, broadly speaking, is to note that the amplitudes CXk 
and 13k above vary periodically with a period that is determined by the num-
ber of marked items. The periodicity is then estimated using the quantum 
Fourier transform, as described in preceding sections. It has also been shown 
[151, 153, 154] that, somewhat surprisingly at first sight, the unitary op-
eration Hn in the definition of D may be replaced by almost any unitary 
operator U and the algorithm with the modified D still succeeds in finding 
Xo in O( VN) steps. 
Grover's algorithm provides a means of searching an exponentially large 
space of possibilities. Exponential searches in general are of fundamental im-
portance in many branches of mathematics and computer science. Of partic-
ular interest is the situation in which the desired property (for which we are 
searching) can be verified to hold for any proposed item in polynomial time, 
i.e. intuitively the property itself is "computationally simple" to verify but 
we need to determine whether an example exists amongst an exponentially 
large number of candidates. As an illustrative example, suppose we are given 
a graph, described as a set of vertices and edges connecting selected vertices. 
A graph with n vertices may be coded as an n x n matrix of O's and l's with 
entry 1 in position ij if and only if there is an edge connecting vertex i to ver-
tex j. We want to decide whether it is possible to find a closed path through 
the graph which visits each vertex once and only once. This is the so-called 
Hamiltonian circuit problem which has many important applications. Now 
given a graph, there is generally an exponential number of possible circuits 
(i.e. exponentially many as a function of the size of the description of the 
graph) but given any circuit it is easy to check in polynomial time whether 
it satisfies the required condition or not (i.e. just go around the circuit and 
see if it visits each vertex exactly once or not). In the theory of computation 
the class of all decision problems of this sort is called N P (c.f. [131, 132] 
for an extensive discussion). Intuitively for N P properties, it is "hard" to 

4.2 Quantum Algorithms 
125 
find a satisfying instance but given a proposed instance, it is "easy" to check 
whether the property holds or not. 
Many computational problems of great mathematical and practical inter-
est lie in NP (c.f. [132] for a long and varied list of examples). Perhaps the 
most famous unsolved problem of classical complexity theory, the so-called 
P i= N P problem, is to establish whether every computational task in N P 
can in fact be solved in polynomial time or not. The motivating idea here 
is that if a property is "computationally simple" to verify then maybe the 
question of whether or not it held in a given structure, should also be able 
to be decided in polynomial time. Note that here we are not thinking of an 
exhaustive search amongst exponentially many candidates (which certainly 
must take exponential time) but of some clever analysis of the structure it-
self that generated the exponentially many possibilities. For example in the 
Hamiltonian circuit problem, is there a way of examining the description of 
the graph itself to see if it has a Hamiltonian circuit or not, instead of just 
unintelligently testing each circuit in turn? 
Considering the intricacy and wide-ranging scope of some problems in 
N P [132] it would appear unlikely that they can be solved in polynomial 
time but this issue so far remains unproven, despite a great deal of attention! 
Note that some special mathematical properties of the particular structure of 
the problem would need to be invoked, e.g. in the Hamiltonian circuit problem 
the solution would be tantamount to developing some deep new theorem of 
graph theory. 
Let us now return to the scenario of Grover's search algorithm. Here the 
database was required to be unstructured (in contrast to the above remark) 
yet by quantum methods, we achieved a square root speed up over a direct 
exhaustive classical search. This speed up can be applied to a blind search in 
any N P problem. The crucial question now is this: can a search through an 
unstructured space of exponentially many candidates be further speeded up 
using quantum effects in some even more ingenious way? Indeed we have seen 
that exponentially large superpositions can be generated in linear time (4.3) 
and that these large superpositions can then be used to probe exponentially 
many values of a function using only a single query (c.f. (4.4)). In the early 
days of quantum computation, it was hoped that this effect might lead to a 
method of searching an exponentially large unstructured space of possibili-
ties in polynomial time leading possibly to a quantum method of solving N P 
problems in polynomial time. For example given a graph we can look at all 
possible circuits in superposition but can we use this effect to determine, with 
high probability, whether there is a Hamiltonian circuit or not? This hope was 
dashed by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard and Vazirani [155] who proved rigor-
ously that no quantum process can speedup an unstructured search beyond 
the square root speed up exhibited in Grover's algorithm. Roughly speaking 
the intuitive idea is that, although we can examine exponentially many can-
didates in superposition in one query, the registering of the desired property 

126 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
will generally occur only with an exponentially small amplitude because of 
the exponential number of components in the superposition. Hence the pro-
cess will have to be repeated an exponential number of times to register the 
property with any constant level of probability. 
Thus in the context of quantum computation, just as in classical compu-
tation, if we are to solve N P problems in polynomial time, it will be essential 
to exploit the structure of the problem in some intelligent way. For example 
the exponential speedup in the algorithms of Simon and Shor makes use of 
special mathematical properties of the theory of periodicity via the techniques 
of Fourier analysis. Unfortunately the important question of the relation of 
the whole class N P to polynomial time computability, appears on the face 
of it to be no easier to resolve in the quantum context than in the context of 
classical computational complexity theory. 
4.3 Quantum Gates and Quantum Computation 
with Trapped Ions 
J.1. Cimc, P. Zoller, J.F. Poyatos 
4.3.1 Introduction 
It is clear from the preceding discussion in this chapter that quantum com-
putation can offer amazing power. The question is: can we implement basic 
elements of quantum computation, such as quantum logic gates, and if so, 
how and in what kind of physical systems. Instead of a general discussion 
we will focus on one particular example. We will describe in some detail pro-
posals related to the implementation of a quantum computer with trapped 
ions [156, 157]. In this scheme, each qubit is implemented as a superposition 
of the ground electronic state (10)) and the excited (metastable) state (11)) 
of an ion (see Fig. 4.9). It will be shown that a set of ions interacting with 
laser light and moving in a linear trap provides a realistic physical system to 
realise a quantum computer. 
4.3.2 Quantum Gates with Trapped Ions 
We will consider the situation where N ions are confined in a linear Paul 
trap, which is able to trap and confine the ions by means of a combination 
of static and ac electric fields (see Chap. 5). The ions basically move in only

one dimension, the axial-direction, because in this direction the trapping 
potential is rather weak, and interact with different laser fields (Fig. 4.10). 
The coupling of the motion of the ions is provided by the Coulomb repul-
sion which is much stronger than any other interaction for typical separation 
between the ions of a few optical wavelengths. 
One of the initial advantages of the trapped ion system is that many of the 
required techniques to prepare and manipulate quantum states have already 
been developed for the purpose of high precision spectroscopy and frequency 
standards. Thus, Rabi floppings and measurements of the electronic states are 
both well developed tools, that will constitute basic parts of the computation. 
\Vhile Rabi flopping, i.e. coherent transitions between the internal states, are 
performed by applying a laser pulse for a fixed time (for example, a 7r pulse 
inverts completely the population from the excited to the ground state or vice 
versa), measurements of the internal quantum state are performed using the 
so-called quantum jump technique. Considering a double resonance situation, 
where one transition is strongly resonant, the other one being weaker, it is 
possible to measure the state of the selected levels chosen as qubits. This is 
done by using two laser beams tuned to each transition respectively. The state 
of the qubit will be measured by the presence or absence of spontaneously 
emitted light from the (dipole-allowed) strong transition, see Fig. 4.9. This 
scheme for detection has been proved to be of almost unit efficiency. On the 
other hand, we will also make use of laser cooling techniques to reduce the 
movement of the ions to small oscillations around their equilibrium position. 
In brief, laser cooling is based on the efficient use of radiation pressure, the 
momentum associated with every light beam. Such a momentum, negligible 
on a macroscopic scale, can nevertheless exert big enough forces on the atoms 
to considerably reduce their velocities (this force can be as big as 104 g, where 
9 is the acceleration due to gravity). An efficient way of using such forces is by 
means of the Doppler effect: in this way, ions moving opposite to the direction 
of propagation of the laser beam will experience a force able to considerably 
slow their motion. 

128 
4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
Let us assume that the ions have been laser cooled in all three dimensions 
so that they merely undergo very small oscillations around the equilibrium 
position. In this case, the motion of the ions is described in terms of normal 
modes, being equivalent to a collection of uncoupled harmonic oscillators 
that can be quantized independently in the usual way. As a requirement, it 
is necessary to fulfill the so-called Lamb-Dicke limit for each mode, which 
physically means that the ion is confined in a region much smaller than the 
wavelength of the applied radiation. 
The task of implementing a quantum computer will be equivalent to find-
ing ways to implement single and two-qubit gates. Single qubit gates will 
be simple, since all we need is to induce Rabi flopping between the internal 
states of the qubit. As we already mentioned, this is a well known technique 
in the case of the trapped ions. Two-qubit gates will be more difficult to re-
alise. The main difficulty is to find a way to connect quantum mechanically, 
i.e. maintaining the coherent superpositions, two qubits. To do this, we will 
consider the external degrees of freedom associated with the string of ions. 
In particular, we make use of the lowest quantized mode, the centre-of-mass 
(CM) motion describing the motion of all ions as if they were a joined single 
mass. The challenge is to swap information from the internal qubit onto the 
quantum wire, the CM motion. Once this is achieved, it will be possible to 
transfer the information from the quantum wire onto another selected qubit, 
realising in this way a coherent interaction between two qubits. 
4.3.3 N Cold Ions Interacting with Laser Light 
This section will be a little bit more technical, showing in more detail how 
to describe the system of ions and lasers and its ability to realise quantum 
computation. We consider the interaction of a given ion i with a standing laser 
wave (a travelling wave could be studied in the same way). The Hamiltonian 
describing this situation, in a frame rotating with the laser frequency, is given 
by H = Hex + HInt + H 1as , where (Ii = 1)

and Wo the frequency associated with the qubit transition), Vk is the frequency

laser beam is normally applied in a direction oblique to the trap axis, in 
this case kL will be given by ke = kL cos( 8), see Fig 4.10), ¢, is the phase 
describing the situation of the ion with respect to the standing wave and r, 
is the position of the ion (expressed in general as a linear combination of 
the normal modes). In addition, we have used the Pauli operators associated 
with a two-level (spin 1/2) atom, and the creation (annihilation) operators 
associated with the quantized harmonic oscillator. 
When a laser beam acts on one of the ions it will induce transitions be-
tween the (internal) ground and excited levels and can change the state of the 
collective normal modes. However, within the Lamb~Dicke limit, and consid-
ering weak enough laser intensities, only the CM motion will be modified. 
Under these limits the interaction with the laser will take the form

mode. The above Hamiltonian is only valid when either f2? i= 0 (6a = 0) or 
f2f i= 0 (6b ;:::: -vd· This means that we will find two available interactions 
modifying (b), or not modifying (a), the motion of the ions. 
We show now how to realise quantum gates between one or two qubits 
making use of the above described interactions. Single-qubit quantum gates 
are easy to implement, since they imply only individual rotations of a single 
ion, without modifying its motional state. They can be realised using a laser 
at resonance with the internal transition frequency (6, = 0) with the ion 
localised at the antinode of the standing wave laser beam. We have seen 
that the evolution in this case is given by the Hamiltonian H~ , inducing the 
following rotation

4. Concepts of Quantum Computation 
On the other hand, two qubit gates will be more difficult to implement. We 
consider first the laser frequency to be chosen in such a way that 6, = -Vz, 
i.e. it excites only the eM mode, and the ion localised at the node of the 
standing wave laser beam. The interaction with the laser is now given by the 
above HI, Hamiltonian. Applying a laser for a fixed time t = br / (f2~T)z / VN)

of the laser and I e') can be either the state 11) of the qubit considered (de-
noted Ie)) or an auxiliary electronic state selectively excited. (This selective 
excitation can be realised by means of different polarisations or frequencies. 
Experimentally frequencies seem to be better controlled than polarisations). 
A two-qubit logic quantum gate can be implemented as follows: (i) using a 
7r pulse focused on the first ion, we swap the internal state of the first ion to 
the motional state of the eM mode, (ii) introduce a conditional sign flip by 
means of a 27r pulse on the second ion using the auxiliary level Ie')" and (iii) 
a 7r pulse will swap back the quantum state of the eM mode to the internal 
state of the first ion. The complete evolution will be given by

( 4.42) 
In this way, the net effect of the interaction will be a sign flip only when 
both ions are in the (internal) excited state. Note that before and after the 
gate the eM mode is in the vacuum state 10). Finally, making use of these 
operations we can realise logical gates employing n-qubits among every set of 
ions. 
4.3.4 Quantum Gates at Non-zero Temperature 
We have seen in the previous section how the system consisting of a set 
of ions in a linear trap appears to be a promising candidate for realistic 
implementations of quantum computations in the lab. The basic requirements 
for computing with laser cooled trapped ions seem to be precise control of the 
Hamiltonian operations, a high degree of decoherence and cooling of ions to 
the vibrational ground state to prepare a pure initial state for the collective 
phonon mode. We will not enter into the first two problems, since these are 
more related to the issues of error correction and decoherence that will be 

4.3 Quantum Gates and Quantum Computation with Trapped Ions

discussed in Chap. 7, but we will show now how the restriction of cooling to 
the zero temperature limit can be Overcome. 
Let us consider the case of two ions in a linear trap. The novel idea is to 
use the movement of one of the ions' motional wave packet to the right or to 
the left depending on the absorption or emission of a laser induced photon, 
after which, the position of a second ion in the trap will be conditioned to 
the dynamics experienced by the first one. In this way one can enforce a 
position-dependent change of the internal state of the second ion. The result 
is a logic quantum gate essential for computation, i.e., the final internal state 
of the second ion depends on the initial internal state of the first one.

Fig. 4.11. Lasers and wave packet configuration for a two-qubit gate at non zero-
zero temperature. After the realisation of the gate, the internal state of the target 
qubit (ion 2), will change or not (denoted with the tilde), depending on the internal 
state of the control qubit (ion 1), i.e. kick right or left due to stimulated photon 
absorption or emission. Here, the dark (light) filling of the wave packets stands for 
the internal excited (ground) states. See text for more details. 
In some sense, we borrow ideas from atom interferometry, where atom 
wave packets are usually split into different parts, each one undergoing dif-
ferent dynamics, and joined at the end of the process to study the experienced 
evolution, as a kind of optical interference analysis. 
We will show in particular how the two-qubit gate operation can be im-
plemented. Firstly, by means of a laser beam, ion 1 is kicked left or right 
depending on its internal state due to photon absorption (emission). Thus, 
the other ion will experience a kick via the Coulomb repulsion conditional on 
the internal state of the ion 1. The corresponding wave packet would evolve 
into two possible spatial wavepackets which are entangled to the internal state 
of the control ion (denoted l R , l L , ... standing for ion 1 to the right, to the

left, etc). Provided the spatial splitting of these wave packets issufficiently 
large (at a given time to), we can manipulate the internal state of the target 
ion, ion 2, depending on its spatial position, i.e depending on the state of the 
control ion (ion 1), and thus implement a gate operation on the qubits. With 
time, these atomic wave packets will oscillate in the trap, and with a proper 
sequence of laser pulses this momentum transferred to the two ions can be 
undone to restore the original motional state (at time tg), see Fig. 4.11. The 
motional state of the ion will then factorise from the internal atomic state 
before and after the gate, independent of whether it is in a mixed or a pure 
state, i.e. independent of the temperature. 
In summary, in this section we have introduced a promising system to im-
plement quantum computation. We have discussed proposals of conditional 
dynamics with ions considering two completely different situations, namely at 
zero and non-zero temperature. A proof of principle of the zero-temperature 
proposal was already reported by the group of D. Wineland at NIST [158] 
which indicates the building of small scale ion trap quantum computers will 
become feasible in the very near future. In the following chapter several as-
pects of the experimental realisation of quantum logic gates will be presented. 

5. Experiments Leading Towards 
Quantum Computation 
5.1 Introduction 
The basic theoretical ideas of quantum computation have been explained in 
the previous chapter. But how feasible is it to actually construct a quantum 
computer? Realising that even a single quantum gate requires two strongly in-
teracting quantum systems highly isolated from environmental disturbances, 
forces us to temper our optimism. This chapter presents several experimen-
tal techniques and results which indicate that a small number of highly 
controlled, strongly interacting, quantum systems are conceivable. However, 
whether or not it is possible to scale up to practical quantum computation 
remains to be seen. 
Three experimental methods have succeeded in realising the proper exper-
imental conditions for small-scale quantum-logic operations. They are based 
on cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED), trapped ions, and nuclear 
magnetic resonances (NMR). The first two methods implement one of the 
simplest coupled quantum-mechanical systems: a two-level system coupled 
to a quantum oscillator. To stress this common feature, Sect. 5.2 presents 
the cavity QED experiments in parallel with the corresponding experiments 
on trapped ions. 
The cavity QED experiments have been particularly successful in demon-
strating fundamental features of quantum mechanics, like the quantum Rabi 
oscillation, presented in Sect. 5.2.3, Schrodinger's cat states and quantum 
decoherence, presented in Sect. 5.2.4. These experiments demonstrate in a 
beautiful way basic quantum logic operations; however, it seems very diffi-
cult to perform a large number of such operations with these techniques. 
With respect to the scaling-up problem, trapped ion experiments seem 
more promising since it is possible to store and cool a string of ions in a 
linear trap. This string can be considered as a register of qubits where each 
qubit (stored on a single ion) can be addressed by tightly focused laser beams. 
In Sects. 5.2.5 to 5.2.12 it is demonstrated that quantum logic on the level 
of single ions can be performed and Sect. 5.3 provides a general overview of 
the experiments aimed towards quantum computation with strings of ions. 
The third method under investigation for quantum computation, based 
on nuclear magnetic resonances (NMR), has already demonstrated a small

sequence of simple quantum-logic operations. NMR involves transitions be-
tween the Zeeman sub-levels of an atomic nucleus in a magnetic field. The 
frequencies of NMR signals from nuclei inside molecules depend on the pre-
cise chemical environment of the nucleus. This allows one to address different 
nuclear spins inside single molecules. The spins play the role of qubits, and 
via the strong spin-coupling interactions inside molecules they interact with 
one another. This provides the basic ingredients for quantum computation. 
Section 5.4 describes the principles of NMR quantum computation. 
More speculative routes to performing quantum logic are based on solid 
state devices. Although a breakthrough in the fabrication of such devices 
would be extremely important, this field of research has not yet developed 
enough to be included here.

5.2.1 A Two-Level System Coupled to a Quantum Oscillator 
An atom in an optical cavity or ions in a trap can, to a good approximation, 
be considered as a two-level system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator. 
In the former case, a two-level atom is coupled to the cavity resonant mode. 
In the latter case, two internal states of one ion (hyperfine or metastable 
energy levels) are coupled to the vibrational degrees of freedom of the ions 
in the trap. Both systems can thus be characterized by the same interaction. 
The interaction (Jaynes-Cummings) Hamiltonian [159] can be written as: 
(5.1) 
where a and at are the annihilation and creation operators for the quantum 
oscillator, 0'+ and 0'- are the raising and lowering operators for the two-level 
system, and n is the coupling amplitude. This Hamiltonian describes emission 
or absorption of photons (in the case of cavity QED experiments) or phonons 
(in the case of trapped ion experiments) associated to an atomic or ionic 
transition. When the harmonic oscillator mode is exactly at resonance with 
the two-level system, the interaction term describes real energy exchange. 
When the systems are off resonance, the energy transfer processes are virtual 
and the interaction results in a phase shift of the atomic levels. 

5.2 Cavity QED-Experiments: Atoms in Cavities and Trapped Ions 
135 
The key point is to realise the strong coupling regime, where the sim-
ple interaction of (5.1) dominates all relaxation processes, such as atomic 
spontaneous emission, photon/phonon damping, and decoherence caused by 
thermal noise. A convincing experimental realisation of the simplest matter-
field system demonstrates elementary quantum logic operations. At the same 
time, it provides severe tests of our understanding of the least intuitive as-
pects of quantum theory, such as non-local entanglement and mesoscopic 
state superpositions. 
Cavity QED developed both in the optical and the microwave domains, 
the basic principles of the experiments being extremely similar. For a review 
of these two classes of experiments, see [160]. In the optical domain, optical 
atomic transitions are coupled to very high finesse cavities. The strong cou-
pling regime has been realised and investigated. This section will focus on 
the microwave domain. Long-lived, easily detected, circular Rydberg atoms 
are strongly coupled to the millimeter-wave radiation contained in a high-Q 
superconducting cavity. Atoms traveling at thermal velocities across the cav-
ity get entangled with the field mode. The lifetimes of both the cavity field 
and the atomic two-level system are much longer than the interaction time. 
Therefore, the field and atom remain entangled even after the atom has left 
the cavity. The joint quantum state of the field and atom may thus be further 
investigated or manipulated at will. 
The second class of experiments described in this section involves ions that 
are confined in an electromagnetic harmonic trap. The quantum oscillator 
is a specific mode of vibration of the ions. It is coupled, by laser pulses, 
to the internal state of the ionic two-level system. With well chosen pulses 
of laser light, the interaction of the ion motion with the internal state is, 
to an excellent approximation, described by the Jaynes-Cummings-type of 
Hamiltonians. Long coherence times of both the ionic two-level system and 
the vibration mode are achieved with techniques developed for ionic frequency 
standards. 
In spite of a completely different experimental environment, the atom-
cavity and trapped-ion experiments implement the same simple model. 
Therefore, any experiment designed for cavity QED can be translated in 
the context of ion traps, and vice versa. Moreover, the achievements of these 
two techniques are quite comparable. The next sections review cavity QED 
experiments in the microwave domain and trapped-ion experiments involv-
ing a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, followed by a comparison of the possible 
perspectives for quantum computation for both techniques. 
5.2.2 Cavity QED with Atoms and Cavities 
The general scheme of cavity QED experiments with atoms in microwave 
resonators is presented in this section. Experimental and theoretical details 
can be found elsewhere [160, 161]. 

136 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
Circular Rydberg atoms offer unprecedented tools for the realisation of 
cavity QED experiments. These atoms with their high-lying energy levels 
[162, 163], having principal quantum numbers n of the order of 50 and 
maximum orbital and magnetic quantum numbers, behave as huge antennae 
strongly coupled to millimetre-wave radiation. The dipole-matrix element on 
the transition between the circular states n = 51 (Ie) and n = 50 (Ig) at 
51.099 GHz is as high as 1250 atomic units. When placed in a weak directing 
electric field, which avoids mixing with other levels in the hydrogenic multi-
plicity, these levels have a long lifetime, of the order of 30 ms, and behave as 
a true two-level system. Furthermore, they can be detected in a selective and 
sensitive way by the field-ionization method. 
In the millimetre-wave domain, superconducting materials allow very high 
quality cavities. Centimetre-sized Fabry-Perot type cavities with niobium 
mirrors are used in the experiments. At low temperatures such as 0.6 K, 
the quality factor is in the range of 108 to 109 , corresponding to a photon 
storage time Tr of a few hundred microseconds up to a few milliseconds. This 
is much longer than the atom-cavity interaction time which is a few tens of 
microseconds for atoms at thermal velocities. At these low temperatures, the 
thermal field is quite negligible and the probability of finding the cavity in 
its ground state is above 98%. 
The experimental set-up used in Ecole Normale, Paris [164]-[168]' is 
sketched in Fig. 5.1. Its core is cooled to 0.6 K by a 3He_4He cryostat. The 
atoms, initially effusing from an oven 0, are velocity selected with the help 
of a laser beam at an angle with respect to the atomic beam propagation 
by velocity-selective optical pumping in zone V. The velocity-selected atoms 
are then prepared in box B in one of the states Ie) or Ig) by a succession of 
laser pulses and adiabatic radiofrequency transitions [163]. The preparation 
is pulsed and produces bursts of circular atoms at well defined times, with 
well controlled velocities between 200 and 400 mls with a ±2 mls precision. 
The position of the atoms is known at any time with a ±1 mm precision. 
Selective transformations can thus be applied on different atoms crossing the 
apparatus. The average number of atoms in each burst is kept below one, so 
that the probability of preparing two atoms at the same time remains small. 
The superconducting cavity C is made of two spherical niobium mirrors, 
2.7 cm apart. It sustains a transversal electromagnetic Gaussian mode with 
a 6 mm waist. When required, the cavity can be filled either by the atoms 
themselves through the process of resonant atom-field coupling or by a mi-
crowave source S injecting a coherent field. The cavity can be tuned in and 
out of resonance with the atomic transition by adjusting the mirrors' dis-
tance or by modifying the atomic transition frequency through an electric 
field applied across the mirrors. 
Before entering C, the atoms cross a low-Q auxiliary cavity Rl in which a 
classical microwave pulse can mix levels Ie) and Ig). Each atom crosses C in a 
few 10 J1S during which there is a strong interaction between the atom and the

cavity field. The atom-field coupling amplitude (n in the Jaynes-Cummings 
interaction) is n /27r = 50 kHz for an atom at the centre of the cavity. This 
corresponds to the exchange rate of a single photon between an atom and 
the cavity mode. When the atom moves across the cavity, the coupling n(r) 
is a Gaussian function of its position. After C, a pulse of classical, resonant 
microwave may mix Ie) and Ig) again in the auxiliary cavity R 2 . Finally, the 
atoms reach two state-selective field-ionization detectors De and Dg , which 
count atoms in states Ie) and Ig) with a 40% efficiency. 
An experimental sequence consists in sending one or two atoms, separated 
by a well defined interval, across the system and detecting them in De or Dg . 
The same sequence is repeated many times, with a repetition period of 1.5 
ms which is longer than the cavity damping time, so that the field in C is 
in the same initial state at the beginning of each sequence. Statistics from 
repeated sequences are then extracted. Samples for joint two-atom proba-
bilities correspond typically to 15000 events, recorded in about two hours. 
Two types of experiments have been performed. In the first one, presented 
in Sect. 5.2.3, the atoms and the cavity mode are at exact resonance which 
leads, via energy exchange, to entanglement of the atomic and field energies. 
In the second, presented in Sect. 5.2.4, the atoms and cavity are not at reso-
nance and therefore the interaction produces atomic or cavity energy shifts, 
resulting in a phase entanglement. 
5.2.3 Resonant Coupling: Rabi Oscillations and Entangled Atoms 
Consider the case in which the cavity is tuned in resonance with the Ie) ---+ Ig) 
atomic transition. Single photons can be emitted or absorbed by the single 

138 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
atom in C [161]-[169] with a continuous stream of atoms, such cumulative 
emissions lead to the micro maser operation [170]. Such a single-photon single-
atom interaction system has been used to demonstrate the quantum Rabi 
oscillation [171], direct evidence for field quantisation, a quantum memory 
[167], entanglement between two atoms [168], and single photon absorption-
free detection [169]. 
The simplest experiment is performed by sending an atom in level Ie) into 
the cavity and measuring the probability that it flips from Ie) to Ig) (zones Rl 
and R2 are not used) [165]. The measurement is repeated for various atom-
cavity interaction times t, obtained either by changing the atomic velocity, 
or by Stark tuning the atomic transition into resonance with the cavity for a 
fraction of the crossing time. 
Figure 5.2(A) shows the Rabi oscillation signal versus effective interaction 
time t in the case that the cavity field is initially in the vacuum state. The 
points are experimental and the line is a theoretical fit. The effective interac-
tion time t, calculated from the experimental parameters, takes into account 
the Gaussian variation of the coupling inside the cavity. Four complete Rabi 
oscillations are observed, at a frequency close to [l/2K =50 kHz. They corre-
spond to the basic Jaynes-Cummings process: the reversible evolution of the 
atom between Ie) and Ig), correlated to the emission and absorption of one 
photon. The damping of the oscillations is caused by experimental imperfec-
tions. This vacuum Rabi oscillation signal is the time domain counterpart 
of the vacuum Rabi splitting observed in the spectrum of the atom-empty 
cavity system [172,173]. 
Figures 5.2(B-D) show the oscillation signal when the cavity initially 
contains a coherent field with an average photon number equal, respectively 
for each figure, to n = 0.40(±0.02), 0.85(±0.04) and 1.77(±0.15). The oscil-
lation involves several frequency components, corresponding to the various 
photon numbers present in the field. The beating between them gives rise 
to a collapse and a revival of the oscillations [171]. The Fourier transforms 
of the Rabi signals, shown in Fig. 5.2(a-d), exhibit peaks at the frequencies 
[l VnTI corresponding to the Rabi frequency in the field of n photons (n = 0 
to 3). The Rabi frequency, proportional to the amplitude for a classical field, 
is thus a discrete quantity. This provides a direct evtdence of field quanti-
zation in a box. Figures 5.2(a-5) show the Fourier components amplitudes, 
which give directly the photon number distribution. The small peak at [lJ2 
in Fig. 5.2(a)is due to the residual thermal field, which has an average photon 
number at 0.8 K of 0.06. 
Besides providing a visceral evidence of field energy quantization, this ex-
periment demonstrates that the atom-cavity resonant interaction dominates 
the relaxation processes. The resulting atom-field entanglement can be used 
to create or manipulate quantum entanglement, thus providing the basis for 
elementary quantum computation operations.

Atom-field entanglement has first been used to realise a very simple de-
vice: a quantum memory holding a single qubit in the cavity. This memory 
is written by a first atom and read by a second. In the simplest situation, 
the first atom enters the empty cavity in state Ie). The effective interaction 
time t is such that Dt = 7f. Therefore, the atom exits C in 19), leaving a one-
photon state in C. The second atom, entering the cavity in state 19) after a 
delay T, absorbs this photon, provided it has not spontaneously decayed, and 
ends up in state Ie). The decay of the probability of finding the second atom 
in 19) versus T measures the lifetime of a single photon in the cavity. Not 
surprisingly, it is equal to the classical field energy damping time Tr [167]. 
One can also send into the empty cavity an atom prepared in a super-
position of Ie) and 19) states with equal weights by a microwave 7T /2 pulse 
in Rl (frequency v). The Ie) component of the atomic state emits, with unit 
probability, a photon in C, while the 19) component remains unaltered. The 
atomic state superposition is thus mapped onto the field as a superposition 
of 0 and 1 photon states, and the atom exits C in state Ig). The field in C 

140 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
has an average photon number equal to 1/2 and a well defined phase, directly 
related to that of the microwave fields in R I . The phase information has been 
carried by the atom from RI to C. 
The field is read out by a second atom, prepared in state Ig) after a delay 
T, which again undergoes a 71' pulse in C. The quantum coherence is then 
mapped onto this atom, as a superposition of Ie) and Ig) states, leaving the 
cavity empty. A 71'/2 pulse is applied to the second atom in R 2 , with the 
same frequency v and phase as the one applied on the first atom in R I . The 
cavity R2 followed by De and Dg thus acts as a detector of the superposition 
state of the second atom, including phase information. The probability of 
detecting this atom in Ie) or Ig) oscillates versus v, as in the usual Ramsey 
fringes situation. At variance with the usual situation, the two pulses are 
acting on two different atoms and the coherence is transferred between them 
via the cavity field in C. Figures 5.3(a-c) show the fringe signals indicating 
the coherence transfer for three different time intervals between atoms. When 
this time increases, the fringe period and the fringe amplitude decrease. The 
contrast reduction reveals the field decay in C. The decay time is twice as 
long as Tn since this experiment involves a superposition of the 11) and 10) 
Fock (photon-number) states, the second being undamped. 
In this experiment, a qubit is transferred between two atoms via a one-
photon field. In the intermediate state, the cavity field is a highly non-classical 
superposition of one- and zero-photon states. Such an atom-to-field mapping 
process is essential in a proposed implementation of a cavity QED quantum 
gate [174]. 
The same scheme, under slightly different conditions, may be used to 
prepare and manipulate non-local atom-field or atom-atom entanglement 
[175]. A first atom sent into the empty cavity in state Ie) undergoes a 71'/2 
pulse (ilt = 71'/2). The atom and the cavity are then in the entangled state 
Ie, 0) + Ig, 1). Atom-atom entanglement can be produced by sending a second 
atom prepared in state Ig) across C with an interaction time such that ilt = 
71'. The photon left by the first atom is absorbed by the second with unit 
probability, leaving the cavity empty and the atoms in the entangled state: 
1 
ItJfEPR) = y'2 (l el,g2) -lgI,e2)) , 
(5.2) 
where the indices label the first and the second atom respectively. 
This is an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair of entangled particles [21]. The 
atoms can be represented by a spin one-half particle, the Ie) and Ig) states 
corresponding to the + 1 /2 and -1/2 states quantized along a direction Oz. 
ItJfEPR) is then the rotationally invariant "spin-zero" state, which means that 
the two spins should be anti-correlated in the sense that they will always be 
detected with opposite projections along any quantization axis. To illustrate 
this, choose an axis in the xOy plane in a direction making an angle 4> with 
Ox. The spin eigenvectors along this axis are of the form Ie) ± e'r/>Ig) and the 
state ItJfEPR) can be written (within an overall phase factor) as:

To analyse the entanglement in the energy basis (0 z axis), we detect 
the state of the atoms after they leave C. Ideally, the joint probabilities 
of detecting the atoms in the various combinations of Ie) and Ig) should 
be Peg = Pge = 1/2, Pee = Pgg = O. We find instead Peg = 0.44, Pge = 
0.27, Pee = 0.06, Pgg = 0.23. The difference is due to the decay of the photon 
stored in C between the passage of the two atoms, and to various other 
imperfections. A quantitative analysis shows that EPR pairs of atoms have 
been produced with a purity of 63% [168]. 
The anti-correlation property expressed by Eq. (5.3) is analysed by ap-
plying to both atoms a 7f /2 pulse in R2 • The spin rotation in R2 , followed 
by a detection along the Oz direction, is equivalent to a detection along a

in Ie) or Ig) after R2 , corresponds to an atomic superposition Ie) ± e'¢lg) 
before R2, where ¢ is the phase of the pulse applied in R2 (+ sign for Ie)). 
According to the anti-correlation, the second atom should thus be projected 
by this measurement on the superposition pointing in the direction opposite 
the measured direction of the first atom. If both atoms were crossing R2 si-
multaneously, a perfect anti-correlation between Ie) and Ig) detectors should 
be observed. In fact, the coherence of the second atom, delayed by time T, 
and the field in R2 precess during the time interval T. The final probability 
of detecting the second atom in Ie) or Ig) depends upon the phase accumu-
lated between the atomic coherence and the microwave in R2 • This phase 
slip is proportional to the atom/Ramsey field frequency difference and to the 
flight time T. This is again a Ramsey fringes situation. However, the two 
microwave pulses are applied to different atoms and the phase is transferred 
between them through a non-local quantum correlation. 
Figure 5.4 shows the conditional probabilities IIe" e2 (IIg" e2) of detecting 
the second atom in Ie), when the first is in Ie) (Ig)) versus the frequency 1/ 
in the Ramsey zones. The modulations reveal the coherence of the state of 
the second atom. They are out of phase since the phase of the second atom 
changes by 7r when the first atom is detected in Ig) instead of Ie). 

5.2 Cavity QED-Experiments: Atoms in Cavities and Trapped Ions 
143 
The experimental data demonstrate the preparation of controlled entan-
glement of two qubits (here, two atoms separated by approx. 1.5 cm). By 
combining resonant and dispersive interactions, this scheme can be extended 
to prepare triplets of atoms of the form Ie, e, e) - Ig, g, g) [175]-[177]. 
The resonant atom-field interaction has also been used to perform the 
absorption-free detection of a single photon stored in the cavity [169]. The 
heart of the method is the conditional phase shift experienced by an atom 
crossing the cavity in level g and undergoing a 271" Rabi rotation in a single 
photon field. When the atom crosses an empty cavity (initial state Ig, 0)), it 
is unaffected by the interaction. When the cavity contains one photon, the 
atom-cavity system undergoes the transformation Ig,l) -+ -lg,l). The 71" 
phase shift of the global wavefunction is similar to the one of a spin 1/2 un-
dergoing a 271" rotation in real space. This conditional phase shift can be tested 
by Ramsey interferometry on a transition connecting g to a reference level i 
uncoupled to the cavity field. The observation of the phase shift amounts to 
detecting the photon in the cavity. At variance with most photo-detectors, 
the photon is left in the cavity after the interaction with the "meter" atom. 
This experiment is thus equivalent to a quantum non-demolition measure-
ment of a single photon field, restricted to the subspace spanned by the zero 
and one photon states. Moreover, the conditional dynamics at the heart of 
the method can be viewed as a quantum logic gate. 
5.2.4 Dispersive Coupling: Schrodinger's Cat and Decoherence 
Consider now the case in which the atomic transition frequency Wo and the 
field mode frequency w differ by 8, where 8 is large compared to n and to 
the cavity linewidth. Under this condition, energy conservation prevents the 
emission or absorption of photons by the atoms and the interaction with the 
cavity is purely dispersive. The atom-field energy entanglement, as described 
in the previous section, is replaced by an entanglement of the atomic state 
with the phase of the radiation field, which can be considered to be classical. 
A microscopic degree of freedom controls thus a "macroscopic" quantity. 
This entanglement is a prototype of a quantum measurement and allows us 
to explore the weirdness of quantum mechanics at an unusual scale. 
Let a circular Rydberg atom interact with a small coherent field in C, 
with cavity-field amplitude 0: and an average photon number 10:1 2 , typically 
between 0 and 10. Since the vacuum Rabi frequency is a Gaussian function 
of the atomic position inside the cavity, the interaction is turned on and off 
adiabatically. This makes photon exchange between the atom and the cavity 
field very unlikely, even at small atom-cavity detunings (8/271" = 100 to 700 
kHz). Therefore, the interaction results only in line shifts. The cavity mode 
is shifted by ±n2 /48 for the atom at the centre of the cavity. This shift, 
resulting from the effect of the index of refraction of a single atom, takes 
the opposite value for an atom in states Ie) or Ig) [161]. It can reach up to

±6 kHz for c5 /27r = 100 kHz, corresponding to an index per atom 15 orders 
of magnitudes larger than the ones of "ordinary atoms" . 
The frequency shift, produced by the passage of a single atom through the 
cavity, results in a phase shift of the coherent cavity field by ±P = ±.f22t/4c5, 
where t is the effective interaction time. The phase shift is typically of the 
order of one radian. This atom-field interaction can be used to generate a 
non-classical superposition of field states with different phases. The atom is 
prepared in a superposition of Ie) and Ig) by a 7r /2 pulse in R I . When it 
crosses C, it simultaneously imparts to the field two opposite phase shifts, 
±P. The combined atom-field system thus becomes 
(5.4) 
This is an entangled state, the energy of the atom being correlated to the 
phase of the cavity field. The coherent field can be represented as an arrow 
in phase space whose length and direction are associated to the amplitude 
and phase, as illustrated in Fig. 5.5(a). The tip of the arrow lies in a circle of 
unit radius describing the quantum uncertainties of the field. Equation (5.4) 
allows to see this arrow as a "meter needle" assuming two different directions 
correlated to the atomic state, as shown in Fig. 5.5(b). The interaction realises 
a "measurement" in which the "field arrow" is used to determine the energy 
of the atom. One can also adopt Schrodinger's metaphor [178]: the +P and 
-P field components are then analogous to the "live" and "dead" states of 
the famous cat entangled to an atom in a superposition of excited and ground 
states. 
After leaving the cavity and before detection, the atom undergoes another 
7r /2 pulse in R 2 , phase coherent with the one in R I . The probability Pg of 
detecting the atom in Ig) is measured as function of the frequency 1/ applied 
in RI and R 2 . Figure 5.6(a) shows the experimental result for the case of no 
photons in the cavity field and for a detuning c5 /27r = 712 kHz. The atomic 
state can be transferred from Ie) to Ig) either in RI (crossing C in state Ig;) or 
in R2 (crossing C in state I e) ). Since the atom does not leave any trace of its 
presence inside the cavity, these two paths cannot be distinguished and the 
corresponding amplitudes interfere, leading to oscillations (Ramsey fringes) 
in Pg .

145 
Figures 5.6(b-d) show the experimental results for a coherent cavity field 
with an average of 9.5 photons and for decreasing atom-cavity detunings. 
The smaller the detuning, the larger the separation of the field components 
in C will be. The inserts in Fig. 5.6(b-d) illustrate the phase information of 
the field which is a record of the atomic state. Such Welcher-Weg (which-way) 
information, even unread, must destroy the interference effect according to 
the complementarity principle. A quantitative analysis shows that the fringe 
signal is ruled by the overlap integral between the two field components, its 
modulus yielding the fringe contrast and its phase the one of the Ramsey 
fringes. For large CP, the overlap is small and the fringes disappear. For small 
CP, fringes are observed, albeit with a reduced contrast. The signals show con-
vincingly that the cavity acts as a meter for the atomic state. Moreover, the 
phase shift of the fringes for large detunings provide a precise determination 
of the photon number. 
The quantum superposition of the mesoscopic field, resulting from the 
above preparation and detection scheme of the atom passing the cavity, is 
fragile and subject to decoherence, especially when 10:1 2 and/or cP become 
large [179]-[186]. In order to monitor the evolution from a quantum super-
position to a statistical mixture, the "cat state" of the field is probed with 
a second atom, crossing the cavity after a delay T [166, 186]. The probe 
produces the same phase shifts as the first atom. It splits each of the two 
field components, caused by the first atom, into two parts. This means that 
the final field state exhibits four components, two of which coincide at zero 
phase. Whenever the two atoms crossed C in the Ie;, Ig; or in the Ig;, Ie; 
combination, the phase returns to its initial value. After the atomic states 
mixing in R2 , there is no information left on the path followed (Ie; ,Ig; or 
Ig;, Ie;), since the second atom has partially erased [187] the information left 
in the field by the first one. The contributions of these two paths thus lead, 
in the joint probabilities Pee, Peg, Pge and Pgg , and in the correlation signal 
7] = Pee/(Pee + Peg) - Pge/(Pge + Pgg ), to the presence of interference terms. 
If the state superposition survives during T, 7] ideally takes the value 1/2, 
whereas it vanishes when the field state is a mere statistical mixture. The 
experimental values of 7] versus T are shown in Fig. 5.7 for two different 
"cat" states (depicted in the inserts). The points are experimental and the 
curves theoretical [188]. The maximum value is 0.18 only, due to the limited 
contrast of the Ramsey interferometer. Decoherence occurs within a time 
much shorter than the cavity damping time and is more efficient when the 
separation between the cat components is increased. It shows that we observe 
a non-trivial relaxation mechanism, whose time constants drastically depend 
upon the initial state. 
Decoherence is due to the loss of photons out of the cavity. Each "escap-
ing" photon can be described as a small "Schrodinger kitten" copying in the 
environment the phase information contained in C. The mere fact that this 
"leaking" information could be read out is enough to wash out the interfer-

ence effects related to the quantum coherence of the "cat". In this respect, 
decoherence is a complementarity phenomenon. The short decoherence time 
of the Schrodinger cat states presented above, about Tcav In, is explained by 
this approach. The larger the photon number, the shorter is the time required 
to leak a single "photon-copy" into the environment. This experiment verifies 
the basic features of decoherence and vividly exhibits the fragility of quantum 
coherences in large systems. Extrapolation of quantum mechanical superposi-
tion states to macroscopic scale leads to an almost instantaneous decoherence, 
validating the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum measurement for any 
practical purpose. This experiment also provides interesting insight into the 
difficulties which have to be overcome in order to produce and control large-
scale quantum entanglement, namely that quantum decoherence appears 
to be the major limitation to large scale quantum information processing.

5.2.5 Trapped-Ion Experiments 
One or a few ions stored in radio-frequency Paul traps offer an ideal environ-
ment to study the dynamics of simple quantum systems, and, with the aid of 
laser pulses, the investigator can tailor the interaction of those simple systems 
almost at will. An especially interesting scenario is created by substituting 
the photon field of cavity QED, as described in the previous sections, by the 
harmonic oscillator describing the motion of the ion(s) in the external trap-
ping potential. A suitable light field can couple two internal electronic levels 
of the ion(s), Ig) and Ie) , to the external vibrational motion at frequency w 
with an interaction Hamiltonian of the form [189]- [192]: 
(5.5) 
where rJ = i5kJ(li/(2mw) is the Lamb- Dicke parameter with the modulus 
15k of the wavevector (or a wavevector difference if the systems are coupled 
by Raman transitions), (at + a) the position operator in terms of the har-
monic oscillator ladder operators and G is a coupling strength, proportional 
to the amplitude of the coupling light field. This interaction Hamiltonian is 

148 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
inherently richer than the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, (5.1), but reduces 
to the latter by choosing the detuning of the light field with respect to the 
energy difference of the two internal states to be c5 = -wand in the limit 
7]j((at + a)2) « 
1. In general any detuning with c5 = (n' - n)w (n, n' inte-
ger numbers) will resonantly drive transitions between the states Ig, n) and 
Ie, n'), and thus lead to another effective interaction Hamiltonian. In addi-
tion, the coupling strength G is not fixed by dipole matrix elements and the 
mode volume of the cavity, as is the case in the experiments presented in 
the previous sections, but can be varied by an appropriate choice of the light 
intensity. 
The techniques to realise the situation described above in a laboratory 
have grown out of the efforts to build frequency standards with trapped and 
cooled ions [193]-[195]. Dynamical trapping of charged particles in radiofre-
quency (rf) traps was first proposed and experimentally verified by W. Paul 
in 1958 [196]. A rf electric field, generated by an appropriate electrode struc-
ture, creates a pseudo-potential confining a charged particle [197]. For the 
trapping of single atomic ions the electrodes have typical dimensions of a 
few millimetres down to about 100 /-tm. The rf fields are in the 10-300 MHz 
range, with a peak to peak voltage of hundreds of Volts. The motion of a 
particle confined in such a field involves a fast component synchronous to the 
applied driving frequency (micro motion) and the slow (secular) motion in 
the dynamically created pseudo-potential. For a quadrupole (rf) field geom-
etry, the pseudo-potential is harmonic and the quantized secular motion of 
the trapped ion is very accurately described by a quantum harmonic oscilla-
tor. For a more detailed description of different types of Paul traps and their 
special properties we refer to Sect. 5.3.2. 
For frequency standards, the trapped ions should offer at least one long 
lived, narrow transition that can be either in the microwave (for example, a 
ground state hyperfine transition) or the optical range (for example a tran-
sition to a metastable excited state). To reduce Doppler shifts and other 
adverse effects related to the motion, laser cooling of the ions is a very con-
venient tool. This cooling mechanism was proposed in 1975 by Wineland and 
Dehmelt [198] and experimentally observed in 1978 [199]. For experiments 
with fundamental quantum systems and quantum logic applications the re-
quirements are almost identical. The narrow transition now forms the well 
isolated two-level system, while laser cooling is the key tool to initialise the 
harmonic oscillator of the motion in a well defined state. 
5.2.6 Choice of Ions and Doppler Cooling 
Although an ion trap is very deep (several eV potential well depth) and will 
hold almost every ion, only a few ions are suitable for cavity QED-like ex-
periments. They should exhibit energy levels appropriate for the realisation 
of a two-level system with negligible decoherence by spontaneous decay, and 
should also allow for optical cooling and detection. The ions of choice have

typically one electron in the outermost shell (hydrogenic ions) and a corre-
spondingly simple electronic level structure. The two-level system can either 
be provided by two hyperfine ground states or by a long-lived metastable 
electronic state [200]. Most of the relevant experiments have been done with 
9Be+ by the NIST ion storage group in Boulder [201], but other groups are 
also gearing up to work on quantum logic and coherent control, as e.g. IBM 
Almaden e38Ba+), JPL in Los Angeles [202] e99Hg+), the MPQ in Garch-
ing [203] eSMg+), Los Alamos National Laboratory [204] (40Ca+) and the 
Universities of Mainz [205] (40Ca+), Hamburg [206] e38Ba+, l7lYb+) and 
Innsbruck [207] (40Ca+, 138Ba+). The following discussion will concentrate 
on 9Be+, where hyperfine ground states form the two-level system, and on 
40Ca+, where an optically excited metastable level is used. The level schemes 
of 40Ca+ and 9Be+ are shown in Fig. 5.S. 
Cooling is required to realise a well defined initial state of vibration for 
the trapped ions. The most obvious choice is the ground state [208], but 
trapping states have also been proposed [209]. Most of the kinetic energy 
can already be extracted by Doppler cooling. This technique is based on the 
fact that atoms moving towards a laser source can be excited if the laser 
frequency is slightly detuned to the red (Doppler shift) with respect to the 
optical transition. The motion of the atoms will slow down due to scattering 
of photons. The momentum transfer due to absorption constantly adds up 
while it averages to zero for spontaneous emission which is spread over a 
47r solid angle. Thus, the motional energy or equivalently the temperature 
of the ions is reduced. The mean final energy which can be reached by this 
technique is given by the Doppler cooling limit ED = fir /2 where r denotes 
the natural width of the excited state of the cooling transition. The same 
procedure is applied for trapped ions if the vibrational frequency (the secular 
frequency w, along the respective axis) is smaller than the natural line width 
r. Here, the required motion towards the laser source is provided by the 

150 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
periodic vibration of the ions in the trap and, as in the case of free atoms, 
the final temperature for this cooling process is TD = ED/kB [210] (typically 
on the order of a few milliKelvin). 
For most ions the optical transition used for Doppler cooling is in the 
ultra violet. For 9Be+, the 2S 1/2 to 2P3/2 transition at 313 nm is used, 
while for 40Ca+ the corresponding transition is at 397 nm. Coincidentally, 
the linewidth is about 20 MHz in both Be+ and Ca +. The cooling light is 
generated by frequency doubling a dye or a Ti:Sapphire laser respectively. In 
Ca+ the P 1/ 2 level may decay to a metastable D 3/ 2 level and one needs an 
additional laser diode at 866 nm to repump the ions. In both cases Doppler 
cooling leads to a thermal state of motion with a temperature of about 1 
mK, but (nD) the corresponding mean number of vibrational quanta in the 
harmonic oscillator depends on the trap stiffness. For the trap used in the 
Be+ experiments at NIST W/21T was 11.2 MHz leading to (nD) '=" 1.3 [211], 
while for the much weaker symmetry axis of the linear trap used for Ca+ in 
Innsbruck (W/21T '=" 100-180 kHz) (nD) '=" 50 [212]. The design of traps is 
determined by a tradeoff between the spacing between the ions, which one 
wishes to be large enough to address each ion by single laser beams [213], 
and the cooling schemes which one wishes to keep as simple as possible. The 
Innsbruck ion trap has an ion spacing of about 15 micro metres whereas the 
NIST ion trap has a spacing of 1-2 micrometres. 
For a single ion the notion of temperature is used in an ergodic sense, 
i.e. the average over repeated measurements will eventually reveal the fi-
nal energy (or temperature). For motional frequencies w, larger than r it is 
more appropriate to consider the spectral structure of the cooling transition. 
Due to the vibrational motion of a trapped ion, the absorption spectrum ac-
quires sidebands at (wo ±nw) where Wo denotes the transition frequency. The 
strength of these sidebands is given by the vibrational energy. It is possible 
to use these sidebands to obtain optical cooling below the Doppler limit. This 
method will be explained in the next section. 
5.2.7 Sideband Cooling 
To a good approximation a trapped ion can be treated as a quantum mechan-
ical harmonic oscillator. As indicated in Fig. 5.9 for motion along one axis, 
the internal states of a single two-level atom are dressed with a harmonic 
oscillator level structure similar to a molecular structure, where the vibra-
tional states are given by the trap frequency along this axis. These levels can 
then be conveniently labeled by the internal degrees of freedom Ie), I g) (de-
scribing electronic excitation) and the external degrees of freedom In) (i.e., 
motional excitation of the harmonic oscillator). For ions in a string the spec-
tral structure is much richer, but the procedures and techniques outlined in 
this section are applicable, after some modification, to ion strings as well (see 
Sect. 5.3.3).

Fig. 5.9. Level scheme of a single two-level ion trapped in a harmonic potential. 
Sideband cooling is achieved by a photon absorption inducing the transition Ig, n) -+ 
Ie, n-1) indicated by arrow 1, and the subsequent decay (via spontaneous emission 
or an additional optical pump process) dominantly into Ig, n - 1) (see arrow 2). 
Very efficient cooling is obtained by tuning the laser frequency such that 
absorption occurs on the lower sideband of the vibrational motion. This ab-
sorption is due to the transition Ig, n) -+ Ie, n - 1) (e.g. arrow 1 in Fig. 5.9). 
Subsequent spontaneous emission appears predominantly on the carrier fre-
quency, i.e. Ie, n - 1) -+ Ig, n - 1) (arrow 2 in Fig. 5.9) and thus the average 
excitation of the mechanical oscillation is effectively damped by one vibra-
tional quantum. One can also actively repump to Ig, n -1) via a fast decaying 
third level. If the photon recoil energy Erec in the decay is much smaller than 
an oscillator energy quantum, the motional state changes only with proba-
bility Erec/(nw). On average the recoil is not absorbed by the ion's motion, 
but rather by the whole trap structure. When these steps are repeated a suf-
ficient number of times, the ion is finally left in the ground state with high 
probability, since once Ig,O) is reached, it decouples from both laser fields 
( dark state). 
In the experiments performed on Be+, Raman transitions, that is transi-
tions induced by two laser beams Rl and R2 indicated by Rl/R2 in Fig. 
5.8, couple two (hyperfine ground) states with a frequency difference of 
WHF/(27r) c::::' 1.25 GHz via a virtual third level. The Raman beams are pro-
duced by detuning a frequency doubled dye laser from the 2S1/ T 2P3/2 transi-
tion by approx. 12 GHz and splitting it into two components about 1.25 GHz 
apart with an acousto-optical modulator (AOM). In this way the frequency 

152 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
difference and relative phase of the two components can be controlled with 
rf-accuracy, and not too high demands are put on the absolute stability of 
the laser. In the NIST experiment no special precautions are taken to spec-
trally narrow the dye laser which has a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz. 
For resolved sideband cooling, the frequency difference is tuned to WHF -
W 
(red sideband). The cooling cycle then proceeds as described above, with the 
repumping induced by excitation on the 2S 1/2 to 2P3/ 2 dipole transition also 
used for Doppler cooling [211]. 
For Ca+, the metastable D5/2 level, indicated in Fig. 5.8, with a spon-
taneous lifetime of approx. 1 second, can be used together with the ground 
state for resolved sideband cooling techniques. Again, motional quanta are 
removed by inducing transitions with the exciting laser detuned by W to the 
red of the narrow resonance. In contrast to Raman transitions, the laser has 
to exhibit a good absolute frequency stability to resolve motional sidebands, 
so care has to be taken in the stabilisation. The setup used at Innsbruck Uni-
versity consists of a Ti:Sapphire laser at 729 nm, stabilised to a thermally 
and acoustically insulated reference cavity suspended in vacuum. The finesse 
of the cavity is 250 000 and preliminary tests suggest a laser linewidth of 
better than 1 kHz. In principle the recoilless return to the ground state could 
serve as a means of repumping, but the 1 second lifetime of the metastable 
state would make cooling very slow. To speed up the cooling cycle the ions 
are repumped to the ground state via the quickly decaying P 3/ 2 level. In this 
manner a single Hg+ ion was cooled to the ground state in one dimension 
by the NIST group in 1989 [214]. In Ca+, the repumping transition can be 
driven by a laser diode at 854 nm. Ground-state cooling of a single ion, and 
recently the ground-state cooling of various modes of vibration for two ions, 
has been observed in a spherical Paul trap at the University of Innsbruck 
[215]. The first cooling to the ground state of collective modes of motion of 
two trapped 9Be+ ions has been reported in Ref. [216]. 
Obviously, ground state cooling is easier if Doppler cooling results in a 
low mean oscillator quantum number. In this case, only few resolved sideband 
cooling cycles are necessary to reach the vibrational ground state. For the 
stiff NIST trap, 5 Raman cooling cycles are enough to end up in the ground 
state 98% of the time [211]. In the case of Ca+ in the spherical Innsbruck 
trap, 99.9% motional ground-state occupation (at a 4.5 MHz trap frequency) 
was measured after a cooling period of 6.4 ms [215]. Here the cooling rate 
was a few kHz. In the case of the linear Innsbruck trap, which has a lower 
trap frequency and consequently higher vibrational quantum numbers after 
Doppler cooling, the difficulty of ground-state cooling is enforced. However, 
the advantage of the linear trap, as mentioned above, is a wider ion-to-ion 
spacing, which simplifies individual addressing for quantum gate operations. 
Furthermore, low heating, as low as one phonon per 190 ms, has been observed 
which is related to the relatively large trap dimensions of 1.4 mm [215].

5.2.8 Electron Shelving and Detection of Vibrational Motion 
The quantized motion of a small number of ions couples only very weakly to 
the environment and it is hard to detect it directly. In contrast, the internal 
electronic state can be detected in a very convenient way by the so-called 
"electron shelving" method proposed by Dehmelt [217]. This situation is quite 
similar to the "classical" cavity QED experiments, where the photon field 
is confined inside the superconducting cavity and hard to access, but can 
be inferred indirectly by measurements on the Rydberg atoms after their 
interaction with the oscillator mode. 
The basic idea of the "electron shelving" method is very simple. A three-
level system is needed consisting of a ground state Ig), a metastable excited 
state Ie), and a short lived excited state Ip). The ground state is now coupled 
to the excited state Ie) for some time, leaving the system in some superpo-
sition o:lg) + ,Ble). If the Ig) -t Ip) transition is now driven, the short-lived 
state Ip) will be excited and decay if, and only if, the system collapses into 
Ig). The fact that a photon is emitted with the decay of Ip), that could, 
in principle, be observed, constitutes a measurement on the superposition. 
The measurement yields the result Ig) with probability 10:12, corresponding 
to the excitation and decay of Ip), and the result Ie) with probability 1,812, 
corresponding to the absence of excitation and decay of Ip). Even if the effi-
ciency for detecting the photon from one decay of Ip) is very low (typically 
10-3 ), one can keep re-exciting the system and scatter millions of photons, 
eventually detecting a few of them provided the state is reduced to Ig). If 
the state is "shelved" in the metastable state Ie) no scattering will happen. 
In every single experiment the answer will be either Ig) (scattered photons 
detected) or Ie) (no scattered photons detected), thus measuring these states 
with almost 100 % detection efficiency and destroying all coherences between 
Ig) and Ie). 
Averaged over many experiments, the number of tries where scattered 
photons are observed will be proportional to 10:12. As an example of the 
efficiency of this method, Fig. 5.10 shows the light scattered from a single Ca+ 
ion into a photomultiplier during continuous excitation on the S1/2 -t P1/2 
transition at 397 nm. When the Ca+ ion is in the S1/2 state it scatters 
about 2000 photons in 100 ms into the photomultiplier. At certain times, for 
example around t =20 s, the ion is excited into the D5/2 state with a weak 
beam at 729 nm and the rate drops to about 150 events in 100 ms, given by 
the number of dark counts of the imperfect photomultiplier and some 397 nm 
light directly scattered from the exciting beam into the detector. Obviously, 
the two states can be well discriminated with good precision within 1 ms, 
and the average dark time is about 1 second, the radiative lifetime of the 
D5/2 state. 
With minor modifications the quantum shelving method can also be ap-
plied to distinguish between hyperfine ground states, as is necessary in ex-
periments with 9Be+. Since Ig) is chosen to be the state with maximum mF

to the metastable DS/2 state, the fluorescence drops. After a mean time equal to 
the lifetime of the excited state (T ~ 1 s), a spontaneous transition returns the ion 
to the ground state and the fluorescence returns to the higher level. 
(F = 2,mp = 2), one can excite a cycling transition to the 2P3/2 (F = 3, 
mp = 3) state using a+ circular polarised laser light (D2 in Fig. 5.8) leaving 
the ion no other decay channel but the one back to Ig). A combination of ex-
perimental imperfections in producing the polarised light a+ and off resonant 
excitations can lead to optical pumping into non-scattering states, reducing 
the detection efficiency [218J. 
5.2.9 Coherent States of Motion 
The production of coherent states of light using cavity QED has been dis-
cussed in Sect. 5.2.3. Here we describe the production of coherent states of 
motion for a ion(s) in a trap. Starting from the ground state, coherent states 
of motion can be produced by coupling the ion(s) to a classical force resonant 
with the oscillation frequency. The most convenient way is to expose the ions 
to an electric driving field at w. Depending on the magnitude, phase and du-
ration of the drive the emerging coherent states are described by a complex 
parameter a with lal2 = 'if, the mean quantum number of the oscillator. 
With more than one ion, normal modes can be excited by dialing in their 
resonant frequencies. Care has to be taken that the exciting field has the 
correct geometry. The centre-of-mass mode will be driven by a homogenous 
field, the stretch mode needs some field curvature, and higher order modes 
will need higher moments of the field. A couple of movies taken of large 
coherent states ('if ~ 100000) in a string of up to seven ions can be seen on 
the home page of the Innsbruck group [207J and are also displayed in Fig. 5.11. 
The field inhomogeneity in this experiment was large enough to excite the

ternal state of the ions interacting with laser light fields. Two laser (Raman) 
beams with a frequency difference equal to w will not induce internal state 
transitions, but will coherently excite higher and higher vibrational modes. 
As a result the ion(s) will (collectively) oscillate with the harmonic oscillator 
frequency w, driven by the beating of the two light fields. Since each of the two 
laser (Raman) beams is near resonance with the 2S1/2 to 2P1/2 transition, an 
oscillating dipole force acts on the ion. By polarising the Raman beams a+, 
one Can even make this force dependent on the internal state: For Ig) there is 
no coupling state in the 2P1/2 hyperfine manifold, so only the Ie) state will 
feel the dipole force. This point will be crucial for creating Schrodinger's cat 
type states as described in Sect. 5.2.11. Both techniques to produce coherent 
states have been used by the NIST group on a single trapped Be+ ion. 
For coherent states with a small mean vibrational quantum number the 
amplitude of the vibrational motion is too small to be resolved with a camera, 
and it is very difficult to detect the motion of the ion directly. Instead, one 
can couple the vibrational motion to the internal two-state system. 
To measure the vibrational motion, that is, to determine the populations 
of phonon-number states In), we first induce "blue sideband" transitions by 
laser light, frequency-detuned to the blue by 6 = +w. These transitions be-
tween Ig, n) and Ie, n + 1) are indicated in Fig. 5.12. By using continuous 
laser light, Rabi oscillations will be induced between the levels indicated by 
the arrows in Fig. 5.12.

a sum of number states having a coherent state distribution. The fitted value for 
the mean quantum number is n =3.1±0.1. The inset shows the amplitudes of the 
number state components (bars) with a fit to a Poisson distribution, corresponding 
to n =2.9±0.1 (line).(Reproduced from Ref. [220]) 
point is that the frequencies are different for all pairs (n, n + 1), thus a Fourier 
transform of Pg(t) will yield all probabilities Pn . Data points are taken by 
shining in the blue sideband radiation for time t and then measuring the 
internal state of the ion with the "shelving" technique as discussed in the 
previous section. In the limit of many experiments for each time t (1000 
experiments in practice) one can deduce Pg(t). The time traces can then be 
Fourier transformed to get the probability distribution of motional levels Pn . 
The experimentally determined signal Pg(t) and its Fourier transform for a 
n = 3.1 coherent state of a single Be+ ion are shown in Fig. 5.13. The trace 
is very similar to the cavity-QED results shown in Fig.5.2. After a quick 
collapse around 6 /-LS, the signal revives at t c:= 12 /-LS. Another collapse and 
revival is visible from 32 /-LS to 45 /-LS before the signal is finally washed out 
by decoherence. 
5.2.10 Wigner Function of the One-Phonon State 
The Pn , as determined in the previous section, correspond directly to the di-
agonal elements Pnn of the density matrix P and at first glance this seems to 
be all one can determine. But one can circumvent this problem by coherently 
shifting the initial motional state. Experimentally this is done exactly as cre-
ating coherent states. Instead of shifting the ground state, la) = U(a)IO), 
the initial state of motion is now shifted, I~mot' a) = U(a)l~mot). Then the 
occupation of the different number states l(nIU(a)l~mot)12 is measured as 
described in Sect. 5.2.9. By doing that with a sufficient number of different

shift parameters a, one can reconstruct the off-diagonal elements of the den-
sity matrix in the number state basis or the Wigner function of the initial 
motional state [219]. 
Starting from the ground state of motion and with the tools at hand that 
are offered by the Hamiltonian given in (5.5), motional states can almost be 
created at will. In practice thermal states, number (Fock) states, squeezed 
states, Schrodinger cat type and other superpositions of number states of a 
single ion [219]- [221] have all been created and analysed by the NIST group. 
Number states are created from the ground state by alternating 7r-pulses 
on the blue and red sideband. This sequence makes the ion climb the following 
ladder: Ig,O} -+ Ie, 1} -+ Ig,2} --t... and so forth. Number states up to n =16 
have been created this way. Their signal Pg(t) is a simple sinusoid whose 
frequency increases roughly proportional to Vn+I with deviations caused 
by the fact that 1] is nonzero (1] = 0.202, see Fig. 1 in [220]). More interesting is 
the Wigner function which exhibits negative regions for number states when 
n is odd. The experimentally determined Wigner function of the In} = II} 
number state is depicted in Fig. 5.14. The experimentally determined Wigner 
function is negative around the origin, in good agreement with theory.

5.2.11 Squeezed States and Schrodinger Cats with Ions 
Squeezed vacuum states can be produced analogously to an optical paramet-
ric oscillator by driving the ion at 2w either with an electric field or with 
two Raman beams detuned accordingly. Squeezed vacuum states with a ra-
tio of quadrature variances of 40 (16 dB noise suppression in the squeezed 
quadrature) [220] have been created experimentally. Unfortunately in con-
trast to squeezed light, there is no sensitive measurement application so far 
that could make use of this astonishing degree of squeezing. 
Schrodinger's cat type states of the exact same form as (5.4) but involving 
the motion of the ion instead of a photon field have been created in Be+ [221]. 
After laser cooling to the 19, n = 0) state, represented by Fig. 5.15 (a), the 
Schrodinger cat state is created by applying several sequential pulses of the 
Raman beams. 
A 7r /2-pulse on the carrier frequency splits the wave function into an 
equal superposition of states 19,0) and le,O) as indicated in Fig. 5.15 (b). 
Then polarised Raman beams detuned relative to one another by w excite 
only the motion correlated with the Ie) component to a coherent state la) 
as described in Sect. 5.2.9 and indicated in Fig. 5.15 (c). Figure 5.15 (d) 
illustrates how a 7r-pulse on the carrier then swaps the internal states of 
the superposition. Figure 5.15 (e) indicates how a second pulse of polarised 
Raman beams excites the motion correlated with the new Ie) component to 
a second coherent state lae'<P). After this step the state has the desired form 
(5.7) 
The relative phase ¢ is determined by the phases of the rf difference fre-
quencies of the Raman beams, which is easily controlled by phase-locking 
the rf sources. In examining the decoherence properties of this state, one has

to live with the drawback that it is not as well characterized and modeled 
as the decay of a cavity mode. On the other hand, the variety of possible 
interactions may enable the experimentalist to engineer a reservoir at will 
[222]. This artificial reservoir will largely determine the decoherence as long 
as the coupling is adjusted in a way that the induced dissipation timescales 
are much shorter than those of the dissipation observed without reservoir. 
5.2.12 Quantum Logic with a Single Trapped 9Be+ Ion 
Trapped and cooled ions interacting with laser fields are strong candidates for 
the experimental implementation of quantum gates as described in Sect. 4.3. 
This was first pointed out by Cirac and Zoller [156]. The quantum information 
is stored in the qubits made up by the internal levels of the ions, while the 
normal modes of external motion, shared by all ions in the trap, can serve 
as the "data bus" to entangle the internal states (see Sect. 5.3.7). Up to 
now, several groups have cooled ions in a linear trap to the point where they 
form crystalline strings (see e.g. Fig. 5.11). Cooling to the ground state of 
motion for two ions has been achieved and work is in progress to demonstrate 
ground-state cooling for strings containing higher numbers of ions. 
In an experiment performed in 1995, the NIST group created a quantum 
controlled-NOT gate between the internal two-state system of one ion (Ig) 
and Ie), target bit) and its motion in the trap (In = 0) and In = 1), control 
bit), thus demonstrating that it is possible to read from the "data bus" 
the harmonic motion [223]. A sequence of three laser pulses was applied to 
perform the gate: 
1. A 7f/2 pulse on the carrier generated a linear superposition of Ig) and Ie). 
2. A 27f pulse on the blue sideband of an auxiliary transition connecting 
Ie) and laux) introduced a conditional phase shift on the Ie) part of the 
superposition. This sideband only couples Ie) and laux) if the motion is 
in In = 1), then the phase of the le)-part is reversed. 
3. Finally a -7f /2 pulse on the carrier led to constructive or destructive 
interference for one of the states, depending on whether or not the con-
ditional phase shift was acquired by the le)-part. 
To get a more intuitive picture one can think of the whole sequence as a 
Ramsey experiment on resonance. Starting in Ig) the first 7f /2-pulse creates 
the superposition Ig) + Ie). Then, depending on whether or not n = 0, the 
superposition remains untouched or a phase shift is introduced for the excited 
part (i.e., Ig) -Ie), only if n =1). The last step is a -7f /2 pulse. Hence without 
the phase shift the internal state returns to Ig), but if the phase shift occured 
(n =1) it will be flipped to Ie). The control qubit remains unchanged during 
the process. The NIST group measured the truth table for the controlled-
NOT operation implemented in this way and also demonstrated the coherence 
of the gate (see Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref. [223]).

5.2.13 Comparison and Perspectives 
In the preceding sections experiments on quantum information and quan-
tum computing based on cavity QED and trapped ions have been described. 
Even if cavity QED and ion-trap experiments basically implement Jaynes-
Cummings type Hamiltonians and thus the same dynamics, each technique 
has its own assets and drawbacks. The essential differences between the two 
techniques are presented in this section. 
The initial state preparation involves standard technology for microwave 
cavity QED since the ground state of the cavity may be reached by cryogenic 
cooling to 3He temperature. The generation of a velocity-selected beam of 
long-lived circular Rydberg atoms involves an excitation by some standard 
infrared diode lasers and a radiofrequency field. Laser cooling of ions mostly 
involves ultraviolet light sources. Cavity QED experiments realise rigorously 
the Jaynes-Cummings interaction, while the coupling for ions in a trap is 
only an approximation of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian in the limit of 
small Lamb-Dicke parameter. On the other hand, the coupling of trapped 
ions with the oscillator mode provides more freedom and can be tailored at 
will to realise more sophisticated functions than the basic Jaynes-Cummings 
interaction. The atomic/ionic decoherence is practically negligible for both 
Rydberg states of atoms and hyperfine/metastable states of ions. Concerning 
the harmonic oscillator mode, the losses of the superconducting cavity are 
fairly well understood and can be modeled. The only adjustable parameter 
of decoherence, the cavity quality factor, is determined independently by 
classical microwave techniques. For ions in traps, the sources of vibrational 
decoherence are not yet fully understood. The calculation of "fundamental" 
sources of decoherence such as damping induced by the image charge of the 
ion in the electrode structure or background gas collisions, result in order of 
magnitude lower heating rates than observed experimentally [215, 218]. This 
"anomalous" heating will be further studied and may eventually be overcome 
since there are no known fundamental reasons for it. 
To perform interesting operations for quantum information, it is necessary 
to manipulate at least a few quantum bits. Using present techniques, cavity 
QED experiments relying on a beam of circular Rydberg atoms crossing a 
cavity turn out to be quite difficult with more than two or three consecutive 
atoms. As discussed above, the average number of atoms per pulse has to 
be kept well below one to avoid two-atom events. Three or four atom coin-
cidences are very rare and the acquisition time increases exponentially with 
the number of atoms. This limitation does not affect ion trap experiments. 
Trapping a few ions in a linear trap is relatively easy. Individual addressing 
of single ions with well-focused laser pulses is feasible. Provided the collection 
of ions is cooled to the vibrational ground state, quantum logic operations 
involving a few qubits can be realised. 
Another major asset of the ion trap experiments is the possibility of de-
tecting the ion's state with almost 100% quantum efficiency, using the quan-

162 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
tum shelving methods. Experiments testing the Bell inequalities on entangled 
trapped ions, for instance, could very easily close the detection efficiency loop-
hole which is still open in the other experiments involving photons or even 
atoms (in cavity QED it seems that there is no prospect of increasing the 
detection efficiency far above 90%). 
It thus seems that "classical" cavity QED experiments are more suited 
for investigations of decoherence and entanglement with a limited number 
of atoms involved (up to about four) in a very well controlled system. The 
preparation of an entangled triplet of atoms of the GHZ type is currently 
being performed. Further studies of decoherence will also be undertaken. In 
particular, it is possible to directly determine the Wigner function of the 
cavity field [224]. This would allow an in-depth understanding of the deco-
herence of a Schrodinger cat state. Finally, experiments with two separate 
superconducting cavities could yield non-local mesoscopic states, combining 
two most intriguing features of the quantum world. 
In ion traps the reconstruction of the Wigner function has already been 
demonstrated, but the absence of theoretical models and the unclear nature of 
the decoherence process in ion traps complicates its understanding. Ion traps 
are also promising as a tool to investigate quantum logic on a moderate scale, 
involving perhaps up to a dozen qubits and a few hundred operations. How-
ever the implementation of the Shor factorisation algorithm (see Sect. 4.2) 
with "interesting" numbers to break classical cryptographic codes requires 
at least 400 qubits which seems out of reach with current knowledge and 
technology [225]. 
New ways have to be found to overcome fundamental limits such as spon-
taneous emission, but the implementation of error correction and code sta-
bilisation techniques (Chap. 7) might offer a way of tackling these issues. En 
route, there are many interesting quantum information processing operations 
already accessible with a few qubits, for example entanglement purification. 
These "information-enriched" states could also be used to improve the per-
formance of frequency standards using ions in traps (Sect. 7.6). 
Beyond all possible applications, experiments on simple fundamental sys-
tems interacting in a well controlled environment will give us a glimpse of 
the most intimate features of quantum mechanics.

5.3.1 Introduction 
Having achieved almost perfect control of the quantum state of a single ion, 
as shown in Sect. 5.2, attention has turned to systems of several ions with 
well controlled interactions between them [226]. Manipulations of their over-
all quantum state include the preparation of entangled states that have no 
classical counterpart. Moreover, the possibility of entangling massive parti-
cles offers prospects for new experiments including measurements with Bell 
states and GHZ states [176] which would allow new tests of quantum me-
chanics. Entanglement of particles offers the possibility to study the process 
of quantum measurement in detail and to investigate the phenomenon of 
decoherence [183, 221]. 
Due to its unique properties, a string of ions in a linear trap has been 
proposed for the realisation of quantum logic gates [156], the basic building 
blocks of a quantum computer. This device operates with quantum registers 
made up of quantum bits (qubits) which can be manipulated analogously to 
classical bits by using gate operations. Ion trap quantum gates rely on the 
entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of the ions (electronic excitation) 
and the collective motion (vibrational excitation) of the trapped string to 
logically combine the qubits. The quantum mechanical analogue of a classical 
XOR-gate is the so-called controlled-NOT operation which can be realised 
using a well defined series of laser pulses to address two different ions in the 
string. It has been shown that a controlled-NOT gate is a universal quantum 
gate, so that in principle arbitrary computations can be carried out using 
just this two-ion quantum gate and one-bit rotations [227]. The realisation 
of these gate operations based on a string of ions is of fundamental interest 
since all basic algorithms could be tested using just a string of trapped ions. 
In this section, the specific properties of linear ion traps are summarised 
and their use for quantum computation is discussed. In Sect. 5.3.2 we re-
view the operation of ion traps and various realisations of linear traps are 
described. In Sect. 5.3.3 we present the techniques required to achieve cooling 
to the ground state of motion, a necessary prerequisite for realising quantum 
gates with strings of ions. Ordered structures of ions are briefly discussed 
in Sect. 5.3.4. In Sects. 5.3.5 to 5.3.9 the specific techniques needed for the 
operation of quantum gates for, e.g., state preparation and manipulation, 
common mode excitations and the readout of the internal electronic state 
with unit detection efficiency are reviewed and discussed.

5.3.2 Ion Confinement in a Linear Paul Trap 
Charged particles, such as atomic ions, can be confined by electromagnetic 
fields, either by using a combination of a static electric and magnetic field 
(Penning trap) or a time dependent inhomogeneous electric field (Paul trap) 
[197]. For the application of trapped ions as quantum bits and registers, the 
Paul trap, and especially its linear variant, seem favorable [228]. 
In order to confine a particle a restoring force F is required, for example, 
F ex: -r where r is the distance from the origin of the trap. Such forces may 
be obtained with a quadrupole potential P = Po (ax2 + (3y2 + 'Yz2)/T5, where 
Po denotes a voltage applied to a quadrupole electrode configuration, TO is 
the characteristic trap size and the constants a, (3, 'Y determine the shape of 
the potential. For example, the three-dimensional confinement in a Paul trap 
is described by a = (3 = -2'Y, while for a = -(3, 'Y = 0 the quadrupole mass 
filter is obtained. The three-dimensional Paul trap provides a confining force 
with respect to a single point in space and therefore is mostly used for single 
ion experiments or for the confinement of large centro-symmetric ion clouds. 
In order to realise a quantum register with trapped ions, linear arrays of 
ions, i.e. ion strings, are required. Therefore, in most cases one employes the 
linear variant of the Paul trap, which is based on the quadrupole mass filter 
potential. The latter potential provides confining forces in the two directions 
perpendicular to the z-axis, but the motion along the z-axis is not affected. 
For axial confinement, additional electrodes must be employed. Radial con-
finement of the ions requires a dc-voltage Ude and an ac-voltage Vae cos(nt) 
applied to the electrodes. Near the trap axis this creates a potential of the 
form 
P _ Ude + Vae cos(nt) ( 2 _ 2) 
-
22 
X 
y, 
TO 
(5.8) 
where TO denotes the distance from the trap axis to the surface of one of the 
electrodes. If only a dc-voltage is applied, (5.8) represents a saddle potential 
which leads to stable confinement in one direction only, as shown in Fig. 5.16. 
However, with the time dependent (ac) voltage, trapping is obtained. As can 
be seen from Fig. 5.16, reversing the sign of the ac-voltage leads to con-
finement in the previously unstable direction. With an appropriately chosen 
frequency n, particles can be trapped indefinitely. As is inferred from (5.8), 
the potential is ideally created using hyperbolically shaped electrodes (see 
Fig. 5.17a). For simplicity they are usually approximated by cylindrical rods 
as in Fig. 5.17b, or more elaborate shapes (Fig. 5.17c), depending on the 
requirements for laser access and diagnostics. Axial confinement is provided 
by an additional static potential Ucap applied along the z-axis using addi-
tional ring electrodes (Fig. 5.17b) or segmented parts of the rod electrodes 
(Fig. 5.17c). This creates a static harmonic well in the z direction which is 
characterized by the longitudinal trap frequency

Here, m and q denote the ion mass and charge, Zo is half the length between

in some cases, analytically. From a practical point of view, however, using a 
measured value of K suffices to describe the experimental data. In the x and 
y directions, the equations of motion resulting from (5.8) are given by the

harmonics of the trap frequency [2 [197] . In practice, the condition that 
a, < q; « 1, i = x , y is usually fulfilled, allowing for an analytical approxi-
mate solution to the equations of motion. It consists of a harmonic secular 
motion (macromotion) at frequencies w, with a superimposed micromotion 
at the trap's driving frequency [2, 
u,(t) = A, cos(w,t + 4?,) [1 + ~ cos(Jlt)] ,i = x , y. 
(5.16) 
The amplitude A, and the phases 4?, depend on the initial conditions, and 
the secular frequencies are given by

w, = 13'2' 
(5.17) 
In this limit and for Udc = 0 (which is usually chosen), the micromotion 
is negligibly small and a confined ion oscillates as if trapped in a harmonic 
pseudopotential 1ft in the radial direction, given by

(5.18) 
with the radial secular frequency Wr ~ qVac/(J2milr~). 
A major advantage of a linear Paul trap (compared with a three-dimensional 
Paul trap used for the storage of single ions) is that the micromotion com-
pletely vanishes for ions confined to the z-axis. The motion is then a pure 
harmonic oscillation in the static potential providing axial confinement. 
Although the use of linear traps for quantum registers with ions seems 
favorable, an elongated version of the three-dimensional Paul trap can be used 
as well to provide strings of two and three ions [216]. Such a device consists of 
an elliptically shaped ring electrode and two end cap electrodes (Fig. 5.17d) 
and the ion string is oriented along the long axis of the ring electrode. With 
this geometry, much higher trap frequencies are possible than with a linear 
trap, which is an advantage for optical cooling (see Sects. 5.2.7 and 5.3.3). 
On the other hand, there is always residual micromotion which may cause 
rf-heating of the string. 
5.3.3 Laser Cooling and Quantum Motion 
In order to store quantum information in a well-defined way, the quantum 
state of each single ion in a string of ions has to be carefully prepared. This 
is achieved with laser cooling techniques in a way similar to that described 
in Sect. 5.2.7 for a single trapped ion. The final stage of cooling will also be 
a sideband cooling technique which eventually prepares the ion string in the 
motional ground state. However, the appearance of distinct modes of vibra-
tion of the string, with different frequencies, modifies the cooling process. In 
particular, the picture of sideband cooling as described in Sect. 5.2.7 does 
not generally hold for two or more ions. The important difference is that 
the incommensurate frequencies of the vibrational modes lead to a quasi-
continuous energy spectrum rather than a spectrum of discrete equidistant 
levels, as for one single mode of vibration. The energy levels of the system 
are now labeled by the internal state Ig) or Ie) and the motional state In) 
where n = (nl' n2, ... ) is the vector of quantum numbers of the modes of 
vibration with frequencies w = (WI, W2, ... ). Correspondingly, the resonance 
spectrum for transitions Ig, n) to Ie, m) exhibits sidebands which are much 
more densely spaced than for a single ion, and by tuning the laser to one spe-
cific frequency, all sideband transitions around that frequency, in an interval 
of the linewidth 'Y of the transition, are excited simultaneously.

Fig. 5.1S. Resonance spectrum of two trapped ions inside (a) and outside (b) the 
Lamb-Dicke regime. The optical transition without change of the motional state, at 
detuning zero, is shown together with its vibrational sidebands at their respective 
detunings. Inside the Lamb-Dicke regime (a) only the fundamental sidebands at 
8 = WI,2 are significant, which involve the exchange of just one vibrational quantum. 
Outside the Lamb-Dicke regime (b), many sidebands appear which involve changes 
in the excitation of both modes by one or more quanta. Taken from [229]. 
More precisely, two cases have to be distinguished [229]. If the sideband 
cooling happens in the Lamb-Dicke regime, i.e. if only vibrational states 
n J and nJ±l are appreciably coupled by the recoil of the light interaction, 
only first-order sidebands contribute, while the exchange of more than one 
vibrational quantum is suppressed. The sideband spectrum is simple, see 
Fig. 5.18a, and tuning to one of the sidebands leads to cooling of the re-
spective mode, as for a single ion. Yet the situation is not exactly the same 
because the other modes, which do not interact with the laser, are heated 
due to spontaneous emission, so that different settings of the detuning, or a 
sufficiently large linewidth "t, are required to reach the ground state for all 
modes. 
The other case, i.e. sideband cooling outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, 
applies to most of the currently pursued implementations of quantum logic 
with linear ion traps. An example of a sideband spectrum for this case with a 
string of two ions is shown in Fig. 5.18b. Obviously, if the laser is tuned to a 
certain frequency below resonance, a set of transitions is excited which involve 
changes in the excitation of both modes by one or more quanta. In this case, in 
contrast to the Lamb-Dicke regime, both modes are cooled simultaneously. 
Furthermore, there appears a new dependence of the cooling rate on the 
linewidth "t of the transition: The cooling rate increases nonlinearly with the 
linewidth because first the rate for absorption-emission cycles is proportional 
to "t, and second the number of levels to which an initial state is coupled, 
and hence the number of channels through which the ion string is cooled, 
also increases with "t. Consideration of the cooling rate, i.e. the total cooling 
time, is important if, after Doppler cooling, many vibrational quanta are still 
excited. This is typically the case in linear ion-trap experiments. 

5.3 Linear Ion Traps for Quantum Computation 
169 
It has been shown by numerical calculations [229] that both inside and 
outside the Lamb-Dicke regime, sideband cooling can be used to bring two 
ions to their motional ground state. Outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime, the 
strong dependence of the cooling rate on the linewidth 'Y of the transition 
can be exploited to optimise the cooling time, by adjusting 'Y in the course 
of the cooling process. 
The ion species employed for the cooling does not necessarily have to 
be the same as that used for the desired quantum calculation. At the Max-
Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, an experiment is set up 
in which a linear string containing magnesium and indium ions is employed. 
Indium can be sideband cooled to the ground state very efficiently [230], while 
magnesium would be used to carry the quantum information. The separation 
of cooling and computation allows the continuous cooling of all normal modes 
without disturbing the contents of the quantum register. 
As a last experimental consideration for laser cooling to the vibrational 
ground state in Paul traps, we mention that any residual stray electric fields 
have to be carefully compensated. Such fields may be caused by patch fields 
on the electrodes and will result in ions being pushed away from the trap 
axis. Consequently, ions undergo residual micromotion which can prevent 
proper optical cooling. Stray fields are compensated by the application of dc-
potentials to additional electrodes in order to push the ions back to the trap 
axis. This is routinely done in all three spatial dimensions with single trapped 
ions in ordinary Paul traps. A similar technique can be applied in linear ion 
traps. In the case of a string of ions, careful alignment of all electrodes is an 
important precondition for the cancellation of micromotion. 
5.3.4 Ion Strings and Normal Modes 
In a linear ion trap, ions can be confined and optically cooled such that they 
form ordered structures [212, 231]. If the radial confinement is strong enough, 
ions arrange themselves in a linear pattern along the trap axis at distances 
determined by the equilibrium of the Coulomb repulsion and the potential 
providing axial confinement. Figure 5.19 shows an example of a string of Ca+ 
ions in a linear trap. 
The equilibrium positions of the ions may be numerically determined. If 
the trap potential is sufficiently harmonic, the positions can be described by a 
single parameter, the axial frequency W z (5.9) [212, 232]. Small displacements 
of the ions from their equilibrium positions cannot be described in terms 
of the motion of individual ions since the Coulomb interaction couples the 
charged particles. Instead, the motion of the ion string must be described in 
terms of normal modes of the entire chain vibrating at distinct frequencies 
[156, 232]. As an example, consider two ions confined in a linear ion trap. 
The first normal mode corresponds to an oscillation of the entire chain of 
ions moving back and forth as if they were rigidly joined. This oscillation is 
referred to as the centre-oJ-mass mode (COM) of the string [232]. The second

between two ions is about 10 {Lm. The exposure time for the CCD camera was 1 s. 
The measured resolution of the imaging system consisting of lens and CCD camera 
is better than 4 {Lm . See also Ref. [231] for comparison. 
normal mode corresponds to an oscillation where the ions move in opposite 
directions. More generally, this so-called breathing mode describes a string of 
N ions moving with an amplitude proportional to their mean distance from 
the trap center. Figure 5.11a and b in Sect. 5.2.9 shows the stroboscopic 
observation made at the university of Innsbruck of the breathing mode and 
the centre-of-mass motion for a string of 7 ions. 
Explicit calculation of the normal modes (eigenmodes) and the respective 
eigenfrequencies of an ion string yield the following simple results [200, 232]: 
(i) for a one-dimensional string consisting of N ions there are exactly N 
normal modes and normal frequencies; (ii) the center of mass mode has a 
frequency which is exactly equal to the frequency of a single ion; (iii) higher 
order frequencies are nearly independent of the ion number N, and are given 
by (1,1.732,2.4,3.05(2) , 3.67(2) , 4.28(2),4.88(2), ... ) wz , where the numbers 
in brackets indicate the maximum frequency deviation as N is increased 
from 1 to 10 ions, (iv) the relative amplitudes of the normal modes have 
to be evaluated numerically (at least for strings with more than 3 ions, see 
equation (28) in Ref. [232]). 
After loading the trap with a string of ions, normal modes can be excited 
by applying additional ac-voltages to either one of the ring electrodes or to the 
compensation electrodes [212]. The normal mode excitation can be observed 
as an increase of the spot width on the CCD camera long before there is a dip 
in the fluorescence collected by the photomultiplier. The frequency measured 
for the breathing mode agrees (to within 1%) with the expected frequency of 
v'3 times the centre-of-mass frequency. Figure 5.20 shows the excitation of 
the centre-of-mass mode (158.5 kHz) for two excitation amplitudes and the 
excitation of the breathing mode (276.0 kHz) for 5 ions. In order to excite the 
breathing mode it was necessary to apply voltages which are typically about 
300 times higher than the ones needed for excitation of the centre-of-mass 
mode (3 V compared to 0.01 V). Excitations of higher order modes were not 
observed with the ac-voltages available in the setup of [212]. This is due to 
the fact that the exciting field is nearly uniform along the ion string, meaning

that the higher modes which need field gradients across the ions are much 
less efficiently excited. 
The COM vibration is excited with a uniform field and therefore is very 
susceptible to field fluctuations whose spatial variation is usually small on a 
length scale given by the ion distance. In contrast, the excitation of higher 
order modes requires large field gradients. Therefore, unwanted excitation oc-
curs much less frequently for higher order modes. Note that during a quantum 
computation, vibrational quanta in the ion chain are generated by Raman 
sideband transitions induced by laser interaction with a single ion. 
5.3.5 Ions as Quantum Register 
Quantum information may be stored in an ion by preparing it in either one 
of two distinct electronic states Ig), Ie) or in any superposition of them. An 
obvious requirement for the choice of these states is that both should have a 
radiative lifetime sufficiently long for the computation to finish before coher-
ence is destroyed by spontaneous decay. One possibility is to use the ground 
state of the ion and a metastable excited state, or even two metastable states. 
Lifetimes can be on the order of seconds (an example being the 2D levels in 
40Ca+, Fig. 5.21b), which should be sufficient for simple quantum calcula-
tions. Even longer lifetimes are possible if one uses two hyperfine components 
of the ground state, which are stable with respect to electric dipole decay 
[216, 228]. Examples include 9Be+ , 25Mg+ and 43Ca +, with beryllium being 
shown in Fig. 5.21c. Also, in the case of ions which do not possess hyperfine 
structure, information may be stored in the ground state by exploiting its 
Zeeman substructure. Note that since ions usually have two Zeeman ground 
states, this approach precludes qubit operations which use auxiliary ionic 
levels like the phase gate described below. Together the internal states of N

ions in the trap span the 2N dimensional Hilbert space in which the quantum 
computation evolves. 
5.3.6 Single-Qubit Preparation and Manipulation 
Prior to performing a quantum calculation, input data must be loaded into 
the quantum register. This process corresponds to the excitation of each of 
the N ions to a certain electronic quantum state. This is most conveniently 
achieved by laser manipulation of the internal states of the ions. A prerequi-
site is that each of the ions can be addressed individually by a laser beam. 
The separation of neighbouring ions in the trap is on the order of 10 j.im, so 
that the laser must be focused to this size in order to avoid cross-excitation of 
the ions. A suitable scheme for addressing the ions is to deflect a single laser 
beam by means of the acousto-optic or electro-optic effect, sequentially point-
ing it to each ion in the chain. This has been experimentally demonstrated 
by the Innsbruck group [213]. 
Preparation of the input state of a given qubit proceeds in two steps. First 
the qubit is erased by transferring the ion to one of the two basis states (lg) or 
Ie)), for example by optical pumping. From this well-determined initial state 
an arbitrary superposition state (olg) + .Ble)) of the qubit may be excited 
by using a resonant laser pulse of variable length to drive a Rabi oscillation 
between the two qubit-states. If a 7r-pulse is used, the qubit is flipped to the 
orthogonal state, and for shorter pulses a superposition state of the qubit 

5.3 Linear Ion Traps for Quantum Computation 
173 
is prepared. The technique of Rabi flopping is also used if unconditional 
single-qubit rotations are required during a quantum calculation to coherently 
modify the contents of a quantum register. 
The details of how the Rabi flopping is accomplished depend on the level 
structure used. If the qubit states are separated by optical frequencies, a 
single-photon transition is employed. In the case of hyperfine states, or Zee-
man substates of the same electronic level, two Raman beams are used con-
necting the qubit states through an intermediate virtual level close to an 
excited state of the ion. 
5.3.7 Vibrational Mode as a Quantum Data Bus 
The operations described so far manipulate single qubits independently of 
each other. For useful computations (logic operations) however, it is necessary 
to provide a strong coupling between the qubits, so that the dynamics of 
any ion in the chain may be conditional on the state of other ions. By far 
the strongest interaction between ions in a trap is their Coulomb repulsion, 
which in equilibrium is balanced by the external trapping potential. As was 
indicated in Sect. 5.3.4, the ions perform oscillations around this equilibrium 
position, which are highly correlated. Of particular interest for coupling ions 
in different positions of a linear trap is the centre-of-mass (COM) mode of 
oscillation, in which all the ions oscillate in phase in the direction of the trap 
axis. Cirac and Zoller [156J have shown how the COM-mode may be used to 
transfer quantum information between ions which can possibly be at widely 
separated positions of the chain. 
Initially, the COM-vibration must be cooled to its quantum mechanical 
ground state, which may be accomplished with the technique of resolved 
sideband cooling described in Sect. 5.3.3. Quantum information may then be 
transferred from any ion in the string to the COM-mode by the following 
procedure: One ion is selectively illuminated by a focused laser beam and 
through a 7f-pulse on the first red-detuned vibrational sideband of the ionic 
resonance, the internal state of this ion is mapped to an external (vibrational) 
state of the ion chain (see Fig. 5.22a). As a result, the ground state and 
the first excited state of the COM-vibration are found in a superposition 
corresponding to the superposition of the lower and upper qubit state that 
was originally present in the ion. Due to the correlated COM-motion, all 
ions in the chain undergo the same oscillatory motion and hence have access 
to the same quantum information. The task of performing a quantum gate, 
i.e., of changing the state of an ion conditional on the state of another ion 
is therefore reduced to the task of changing the ionic state conditional on 
the vibrational state of the COM-mode (see Fig. 5.22b), as explained in the 
following section. The oscillation of the ions acts like a quantum bus, linking 
the qubit registers along the chain. After the operation on the second ion has 
been performed, step (a) must be reversed in order to restore the vibrational

mode to its ground state and at the same time return the first ion to its 
initial state. 
5.3.8 Two-Bit Gates in an Ion-Trap Quantum Computer 
The essential step of the Cirac- Zoller proposal for an ion-trap quantum com-
puter is the realisation of a two-bit quantum gate, with the vibrational state 
of the COM-mode and the internal state of one ion as input qubits. In the 
following, we will describe gates in which the vibrational mode acts as the 
control bit, conditioning the state change in the target ion. 
The most straightforward gate is one in which only one combination of 
basis states will lead to a modification of the output. This is the case for 
the so-called phase gate, in which the wavefunction of the system acquires a 
phase shift of 7r (change of sign) if both input qubits are in the upper state 
and is left unchanged in all other cases. To realise the change of sign of the 
wavefunction it is sufficient to apply a 27T-pulse to the ion. In order to obtain 
the required conditional dynamics, the pulse should be on a transition which 
couples only to the upper internal state of the ion. This requires the presence 
of an auxiliary electronic level, which could be another Zeeman substate or 
a different electronic level. Conditioning on the vibrational state is achieved 
by tuning to the first blue COM-sideband, which only leads to a transition 
if at least one vibrational quantum is present. Note that by construction, no 
more than one vibrational quantum may be excited in this scheme. 
Other gates are possible by combining the phase gate with single qubit 
rotations. An example is the controlled NOT (CNOT) gate (see Sect. 5.2.12), 
in which the target bit is flipped depending on the state of the control bit. 
This may be realised by applying a (resonant) 7T j2-pulse before and after the 
phase gate, corresponding to a temporary change of the computational basis 
to Ig) ± Ie). A CNOT gate for a single qubit using its vibrational mode as 
the control bit has been experimentally demonstrated [211]. 

5.3 Linear Ion Traps for Quantum Computation 
175 
Fig. 5.23. State measurements on ion qubits. Each ion is individually addressed 
with a laser beam tuned to the readout transition (cf. Fig. 5.21a) and the fluores-
cence monitored. 
In some cases it may be useful to obtain the CNOT directly, for example 
when no suitable auxiliary levels are available in the ion's level scheme. To do 
this one can exploit the fact that the coupling between internal and external 
degrees of freedom depends nonlinearly on the number of excited vibrational 
quanta [233] . For a suitable choice of parameters, a resonant pulse will act 
as a 2IT-pulse if the system is in its lowest vibrational state, but as a IT-pulse 
if one vibrational quantum is present, so that only in the latter case will the 
ion's state be flipped. 
5.3.9 Readout of the Qubits 
At the end of the quantum computation it is necessary to read out the result 
of the calculation, i.e., determine the state of the qubit register. Clearly this 
involves a projection of the state of the ions onto the basis states used for 
the detection. 
The ion trap quantum computer has the advantage that the readout can 
be achieved with nearly 100% detection efficiency by applying a method first 
demonstrated for the detection of quantum jumps in single ions [234] (see 
Sect. 5.2.8). Each ion is subsequently illuminated by a laser tuned to a fast 
transition which is coupled to only one of the qubit states and the emitted flu-
orescent light is detected (Fig. 5.23). The presence of scattered light indicates 
occupation of the coupled state, its absence occupation of the orthogonal ba-
sis state. Superposition states may be probed by rotating the qubit prior to 
detection. 
5.3.10 Conclusion 
In the above sections we have outlined the principle of operation of an ion 
trap and its application to the task of performing quantum computations. 
Currently, a string of ions in a linear trap seems to be a most promising 
candidate for demonstrating the basic concept of a quantum computer. The 
principal benefits of the system are the long decoherence times of the internal 
states of the ions and the ability to prepare, coherently control and read 

176 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
out the states of the qubits by means of laser pulses. Among the quantum 
computation schemes implemented experimentally so far, ion traps have, at 
least theoretically, the largest potential for being scaled up to provide qubit 
registers long enough to run useful quantum algorithms. 
In a realistic ion trap quantum computer, practical issues limit the size 
of calculations that may be implemented. Electromagnetic field fluctuations 
and collisions with background gas in the vacuum chamber may lead to de-
coherence rates larger than the radiative decay rates of the internal states 
of the ion. Even more restrictive is decoherence of the vibrational states of 
the ion string. For a single 198Hg+ ion, a transition out of the zero-point 
vibrational level occurred in 0.15 s [214], while in the case of 9Be+ a lifetime 
of 1 ms [211] was measured. For experimental data on 40Ca+ see Ref. [215]. 
These processes put an upper limit on the number of operations that may 
be performed with a quantum computer before coherence is lost. However, in 
view of the recent experimental results [212, 216], some of the more technical 
limitations may be overcome using a breathing mode as the quantum data 
bus. 
Additional problems affect the performance of a quantum computer dur-
ing logic operations. Processes compromising the fidelity of the system evolu-
tion are inaccurate timing of the laser pulses, errors in the detunings, inten-
sities and phases of the laser beams, and deviations between the laser focus 
and the ion positions. However, such errors may be taken care of eventually 
by an implementation of error correcting codes and protocols. 
Although the number of ions that may be stored in the trap should only 
be limited by the size of the trap and the laser power available for cooling, 
only a string of two ions has been successfully cooled to the ground state of 
motion so far [216]. This number is likely to increase in the near future to 
a few tens of ions, but the thousands of qubits and billions of laser pulses 
needed, for example, to implement Shor's algorithm for factorising nontrivial 
numbers seems to be beyond experimental reach at present. However, ion 
traps offer the best prospects for testing small networks of quantum gates 
as well as schemes for quantum error correction. In this way the ion trap 
provides an ideal environment for synthesizing, manipulating and probing 
highly entangled quantum states of a string of ions. 

5.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments

5.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments 
J.A Jones 
5.4.1 Introduction 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the study of transitions between the 
Zeeman levels of an atomic nucleus in a magnetic field. Described so simply, 
it is hard to see why anyone would be interested in it, but NMR is in fact one 
of the most important spectroscopic techniques available in the molecular 
sciences [235, 236J. This is because the frequencies of NMR signals depend 
subtly on the precise chemical environment of the nucleus, and so careful 
study of a molecule's NMR spectrum allows its structure to be determined. 
NMR has long been considered as a possible technology for implement-
ing quantum computers. Superficially the idea is attractive, as nuclear spins 
provide a good source of qubits, and it is fairly simple to construct quantum 
logic gates. There is, however, one major problem: it is difficult to place an 
NMR quantum computer in a well defined initial state, which appears es-
sential for any interesting computation. This problem was solved recently by 
two separate approaches [237J-[239]' and since then progress has been rapid. 
Because of the importance of NMR in the molecular sciences, there has 
been extensive technical development of NMR spectrometers. Huge sums 
of money have been spent on optimising every component, and commercial 
spectrometers are widely available with performances close to the theoretical 
limits. Modern spectrometers are extremely complex devices, but they are 
easily controlled, and with a little assistance even the most nervous theoreti-
cian should be able to perform simple NMR experiments. 
5.4.2 The NMR Hamiltonian 
The NMR Hamiltonian can in the worst case be rather complex [236, 240, 
241], but in many cases much of this complexity can be ignored. Firstly I 
will only consider spin-~ nuclei (such as IH, 13C, 15N, 19F, and 31p), as these 
nuclei do not experience many of the interactions which occur in high-spin 
nuclei. These nuclei are also the most important for current implementations 
of NMR quantum computers, as the two spin states of a spin-~ nucleus pro-
vide a natural two-level system for implementing a qubit. Secondly I shall 
assume that the NMR sample is a fluid (normally either a pure liquid or 
a solution). Rapid molecular motion in fluids greatly simplifies the NMR 
Hamiltonian, as anisotropic interactions can be replaced by their isotropic 
average, which is often zero. NMR signals from spin-~ nuclei in fluids are 

178 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
typically rather narrow, and so such studies are often referred to as "high 
resolution" NMR [242]. 
Two interactions are particularly important in high resolution NMR. The 
first of these is of course the Zeeman interaction. In the presence of a magnetic 
field B z , directed along the z-axis, the degeneracy of the two spin states 
(Iz = ±Hi) is lifted by the Zeeman interaction 
(5.19) 
where'Y (the gyromagnetic ratio) is a constant characteristic of the nucleus. 
The Zeeman splitting corresponds to a frequency of around 500 MHz for 1 H 
nuclei in typical NMR magnets, and so NMR experiments are performed 
using radio frequency (RF) radiation. 
It is not practical to use conventional spatial localisation techniques to 
pick out individual molecules, as the spacing between molecules (a few A) 
is small compared with the wavelength of the RF radiation, and in any case 
the individual molecules are undergoing rapid motion. Instead, the combined 
signal from all the molecules is detected. This has important consequences for 
NMR experiments, as they are implemented not on individual spin systems 
but on statistical ensembles of such systems. It is, however, possible to distin-
guish between different nuclei in the same molecule. Electrons surrounding 
the nuclei act to shield them from the magnetic field, thus modifying the 
apparent gyromagnetic ratio. The extent of this shielding depends on the 
chemical environment of the nucleus, and thus nuclei in different environ-
ments have slightly different transition frequencies. 
The second important interaction in high resolution NMR is scalar cou-
pling (J-coupling). This is not simple dipole-dipole coupling, which is aver-
aged out by rapid molecular tumbling, but a more subtle effect related to the 
Fermi contact interaction. When the coupling between two nuclei, I and S, 
is small compared with the difference between their NMR frequencies (weak 
coupling) the coupling Hamiltonian takes the simple form 
(5.20) 
where hs, the spin-spin coupling constant, depends on details of the molec-
ular structure. This coupling is directly observable in NMR spectra as a 
splitting (of size h s) in the NMR signals corresponding to each nucleus. 
A simple example: Figure 5.24 shows the chemical structure of deuterated 
cytosine. Cytosine is one of the four "bases" which are used to encode infor-
mation in DNA, and has recently been used to implement an NMR quantum 
computer [243]. For this purpose three of the hydrogen nuclei in the molecule 
were replaced by deuterium, which can be easily achieved by dissolving it in 
D20. The 1 H spectrum of this molecule on a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer is 
shown in Fig. 5.25. Each of the two 1 H nuclei gives rise to a pair of signals, 
called a doublet. The two doublets occur at a frequency of about 500 MHz,

5.4.3 Building an NMR Quantum Computer 
While several different models of quantum computing have been considered, 
the most common approach is based on quantum logic circuits. Such a quan-
tum computer has four main elements which must be implemented. The first 
of these, qubits, is easy, as the two spin states of a spin-~ nucleus provide an 
ideal two-level system. The remaining elements are slightly more complex. 
Quantum gates: Quantum logic circuits are constructed by interconnecting 
qubits with quantum gates. While many different gates are possible it is well 
known that any gate can be constructed using a suitable combination of one 
qubit and two qubit gates [244]. One qubit gates correspond to rotations of 
a single spin within its own Hilbert space, and these can be readily achieved 
using RF fields. Two qubit gates, such as the controlled-NOT gate, are more 
complex as they involve conditional dynamics, and thus require an interac-
tion between the two qubits. In NMR the scalar coupling (J-coupling) is well 
suited to this purpose: while scalar coupling does not have exactly the form 
required to construct traditional controlled gates it can be easily combined 

180 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
with one qubit gates to make them [245]. For example the controlled-NOT 
gate can be achieved by placing a controlled phase shift gate (which per-
forms the transformation 111) -+ -111), while leaving the other basis states 
unchanged) between a pair of one qubit Hadamard gates applied to the target 
qubit. The controlled phase shift can itself be achieved by combining evolu-
tion under the scalar coupling, which results in a two qubit phase rotation, 
with single qubit phase shift gates [245]. 
The CLEAR operator: Quantum logic gates transform qubits from one state 
to another. Clearly this is only useful if the qubits start off in some well de-
fined input state. In practice it is sufficient to have some method for reaching 
any single state, as other initial states can then be reached by applying one 
bit gates. The obvious choice of initial state is to have all qubits in the 10) 
state, corresponding to a CLEAR operation. 
In principle CLEAR should be easy to implement as it takes the quantum 
computer to its energetic ground state, which can be achieved by some cooling 
process. Unfortunately this approach is not practical in NMR as the energy 
gap between Zeeman levels is small compared with the Boltzmann energy 
at any reasonable temperature. At room temperature the energy gap is so 
small compared to kT that the population of all the states will be almost 
equal, with only small deviations (around one part in 104 ) from the average. 
No NMR signal will be observed from the average population, as the signals 
from different molecules will cancel out, but a small signal can be seen which 
arises from the deviations away from the average. 
For a molecule containing a single isolated nucleus, that is a computer with 
a single qubit, it is easy to reach an effective 10) state: at thermodynamic 
equilibrium the deviation from equal populations is just a slight excess in the 
(low energy) 10) state compared with the (slightly higher energy) 11) state. 
Unfortunately this simple approach does not work for larger systems, as the 
pattern of population deviations is more complicated, and does not have the 
desired form. This apparent inability to implement CLEAR made NMR an 
impractical quantum computing technology for many years. 
Towards the end of 1996 two separate approaches were discovered for solv-
ing this problem. The first approach, due to Cory and coworkers [237, 238], 
uses complex NMR pulse sequences to modify the populations of different 
spin states, eventually creating the desired pattern, and thus a state equiv-
alent to the desired initial state. An alternative approach, due to Chuang 
and Gershenfeld, works by separating the spin system into many different 
subsystems [239, 246]. Within these subsystems the equilibrium pattern of 
populations has the desired form, and so the desired starting state is acces-
sible. While this approach is theoretically elegant, it is complicated to apply 
in practice, and has not been widely used. More recent approaches, such as 
temporal averaging [247], are conceptually related to that of Cory et al., and 
will not be described further. A detailed comparison of the various methods 
has been made by Havel and coworkers [248]. 

5.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments

Output: Finally it is necessary to have some method for reading out the 
final answer. Typically this is obtained by reading the values of one or more 
qubits which finish the calculation in eigenstates. In an NMR quantum com-
puter this corresponds to determining whether the population of the I 0) state 
is higher than that of the 11) state, or vice versa. It is not practical to de-
termine these populations directly, but an equivalent measurement is easily 
made by applying a 900 excitation RF pulse. This creates a coherent superpo-
sition of 10) and 11) which then oscillates in the magnetic field. The relative 
populations can then be determined by observing the size and phase of this 
oscillatory signal. The absolute phase of the signal is meaningless, but it is 
possible to incorporate a reference signal, so that only relative phases need 
be measured. 
Some quantum algorithms produce a result occupying two or more qubits, 
and in this case two different approaches are possible. The first approach is 
to excite only one of the corresponding spins; in this case the states of the 
other spins can be monitored by examining the multiplet structure of the 
observed spin. Alternatively it is possible to excite all the spins and observe 
them simultaneously; in this case the state of each spin can be determined 
directly from the phase of its NMR signal. 
NMR quantum computers have a potential advantage over other designs 
in that it is not necessary for the answer to be stored as an eigenstate. It 
is instead possible to observe some superpositions directly. This possibility 
arises because of the ensemble average implicit in any NMR measurement. 
While measurements on a single spin system cause superpositions to collapse, 
the equivalent effect is not seen in ensemble averages. Thus it is possible, 
for example, to monitor two complementary observables continuously and 
simultaneously. This mode of operation could be useful in future experiments. 
5.4.4 Deutsch's Problem 
The concepts described above can be illustrated using an NMR quantum 
computer designed to implement an algorithm to solve Deutsch's prob-
lem [138, 249J . This problem is described in detail in Sect. 4.2.4, and only a 
brief summary will be given here. Consider a binary function 
J(x) : B f-+ B, 
(5.21 ) 
and suppose we have a corresponding operator Uf' such that 
Uf 
I x) I y) -----'-+ I x) I y ED J(x)) . 
(5.22) 
Clearly it is possible to build quantum circuits to determine J(O) and J(I), 
as shown in Fig. 5.26a. Deutsch's problem is the determination of J(O) ED J(I) 
with only a single application of Uf (corresponding to a single evaluation 
of I). This is impossible on a classical computer, but can be achieved on a 
quantum computer using the circuit shown in Fig. 5.26b.

(Deutsch's problem). H represents the single qubit Hadamard gate. 
This circuit has been implemented on our two qubit NMR quantum com-
puter based on partially deuterated cytosine [243] (similar results have also 
been obtained by Chuang et al. using a two qubit NMR quantum computer 
based on chloroform [250]). In our NMR quantum computer each doublet 
corresponds to the signal from one qubit. The value of the qubit can be 
determined from the phase of the corresponding signal: a positive signal cor-
responds to a qubit in the I 0) state, while a negative signal corresponds to a 
qubit in the 11) state. 
As mentioned above, the absolute phase of an NMR signal is not mean-
ingful, as it depends on a variety of experimental factors. Relative phases 
are, however, meaningful, and so it is possible to obtain "absolute" phases 
by adjusting the spectrum so that the phase of a reference signal is correct. 
The relative phases of signals in two different experiments can also be mean-
ingful if the two experiments are acquired in an identical fashion, and so it is 
possible to use a reference signal from one experiment to correct signals from 
another experiment. This is the approach adopted in the results discussed 
below. 
Experimental results from a classical algorithm to determine 1(0) are 
shown in Fig. 5.27. In this algorithm the left hand pair oflines (corresponding 
to the first qubit) indicates the input value, while the right hand pair of lines 
(corresponding to the second qubit) indicate the output value. Results are 
shown for the four possible binary functions, listed in Table 5.1. As expected

the left hand signals are always positive, indicating the input value (0), while 
the right hand signals are positive when f(O) = 0 (for foo and fod and 
negative when f(O) = 1 (for fIo and f11). The absolute phase ofthese spectra 
is unknown, but this was solved by adjusting the phase of spectrum (a) such 
that the left hand signal was positive, and then applying the same phase 
correction to all the other spectra. 
These plots do not clearly show the fine structure within each doublet, 
but this is not particularly important as within this implementation of a 
quantum computer all the lines in the multiplet should have the same sign, 
as is indeed observed. Ideally this sign would be simply positive or negative, 
but in practice the lineshapes observed are slightly more complex. Similarly 
all the lines should have the same height, while the experimental results 
show substantial variations. These lineshape and height distortions arise from 
errors in the computer. For the most part these errors are systematic, in that 
they arise because the computer does not implement quantum gates perfectly 
correctly. It should be possible to reduce these errors by careful optimisation 
of the NMR pulse sequences used to implement gates. 
The same algorithm can be used to determine f(I): all that is needed is to 
change the input value. The results ofthis approach are shown in Fig. 5.28. In 
this case the left hand signals are always negative, indicating the new input 
value (1), while the right hand signals can be either negative or positive. As 
expected this signal is positive when f(l) = 0 (for foo and flO) and negative 
when f(l) = 1 (for f01 and f11). Note that the same phase correction was used

for these spectra as for those in Fig. 5.27, showing that relative phases can be 
defined for two different experiments performed under identical conditions. 
Finally, this quantum computer can also be used to implement an algo-
rithm to solve Deutsch's problem (determining f(O) EB f(I)). The results are 
shown in Fig. 5.29. In this case there is no input bit, as the quantum computer 
uses a superposition of the two possible inputs, and the answer is encoded as 
the phase of the left hand signals. The second qubit is simply a working bit, 
and both starts and ends the computation in state 11). As expected the right 
hand signals are always negative, while the left hand signals are positive for 
foo and f11 (for which f(O) EB f(l) = 0), and negative for fOl and flO (for 
which f(O) EB f(l) = 1). 
5.4.5 Quantum Searching and Other Algorithms 
Since the discovery that it is possible to generate effectively pure starting 
states in NMR quantum computers progress has been extremely rapid. Two 
qubit computers have been used to implement Grover's quantum search al-
gorithm with a two qubit search space [251]-[253]. This allows a single item 
to be located in a search over four items with a single query; the algorithm 
begins with the quantum computer in the state I 00) and ends in the state 
corresponding to the matching item (100), 101),110), or 111)). This algorithm 
has been implemented on our cytosine quantum computer [252], and the re-
sults are shown in Fig. 5.30. The results shown are slightly better than those 
published earlier [252]; they were acquired using modified pulse sequences as 
described in [254]. 
While NMR quantum computers are capable of performing a simple 
Grover search, for which there is only one item to be found, difficulties arise 
in the general case when more than one item matches the search criteria. 
In this case a conventional quantum computer will return one of the match-
ing items at random, while an NMR implementation will return some sort 
of ensemble average over all the matches, and it is difficult or impossible 
to deduce anything useful from this ensemble result. It is, however, possible 
to overcome this problem by using a closely related approach, approximate 
quantum counting [254].

Grover's quantum search over a two qubit search space; the result is shown for each

Three qubit systems have been studied, but have largely been used to 
demonstrate interesting quantum phenomena, such as GHZ states [255, 256], 
simple error correction protocols [257, 258], and teleportation [259]. They 
have also been used, however, to implement the three qubit Deutsch-Jozsa 
algorithm [260]. A partial demonstration of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on 
a five-qubit system has also been given [261]. 
5.4.6 Prospects for the Future 
There are several major problems which might act to limit the size of real 
NMR quantum computers based on the current approach. The most widely 
discussed problems are the exponential loss of signal intensity with increasing 
numbers of qubits, followed by the effects of decoherence. In fact these effects 
are unlikely to be very important as other problems are likely to become 
visible first. Nevertheless it is useful to discuss these issues and how they 
might be tackled. 
Exponential signal loss: The exponential loss in signal with increasing 
numbers of qubits arises as a result of the need to distill an effective pure 
state from the thermal equilibrium density matrix. Adding an additional 
qubit means adding an additional spin, doubling the number of spin states in 
the system and thus doubling the number of ways in which a flip of the state 
of anyone spin can occur. Distilling out an effective pure state is equivalent 
to selecting only one of these possible transitions, with a consequent loss in 
signal intensity [262]. Note that this problem is not confined to NMR, but 
will also arise in any ensemble quantum computation working in the high 
temperature regime (f1E « kT). 
Clearly this exponential fall off in signal is a potential limit, but in prac-
tice its importance has been overstated. NMR spectra can be acquired with a 
fairly high signal-to-noise ratio (the spectrum in Fig. 5.25 has a ratio of about 
800), and thus the signal loss will only be a serious problem for NMR comput-
ers containing ten qubits or more. It is possible to increase the signal-to-noise 
ratio by a variety of simple means, such as signal averaging or increasing the 
sample size, or by more subtle approaches such as optical pumping [263]. 

186 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
A different approach, suggested by Schulman and Vazirani [264] is to use 
computational methods to purify a collection of low fidelity qubits. It is not 
practical to apply this approach directly to a thermal ensemble, but if used in 
combination with other methods for increasing the initial polarisation, such 
as optical pumping, it may prove useful. 
Decoherence: Decoherence (that is, the conversion of coherent superpo-
sitions into incoherent mixtures by random processes) is another potential 
problem, which is common to all implementations of quantum computers. 
Any quantum superposition has a characteristic decoherence time, and it is 
necessary to ensure that any calculations are completed in a time which is 
not too long compared with the decoherence time (although error correction 
techniques allow this time scale to be extended). In NMR quantum computers 
this time is generally related to the spin-spin relaxation time, T2 , although 
this is a simplification as T2 is the decoherence time of a single spin coherence, 
and the decoherence times for multi-spin coherences can be quite different. 
Nevertheless T2 does give a very approximate idea of the appropriate time 
scale, which for the NMR computers currently being investigated (based on 
small molecules in solution) is of the order of a few seconds. 
The relevant parameter for a quantum computer is not the decoherence 
time itself, but the ratio of the decoherence time to the time taken to execute 
a quantum gate. For simple two-bit gates, such as the controlled-NoT, this 
time is comparable to the inverse of the scalar spin-spin coupling (around 
5-150ms), suggesting that it should be possible to implement tens or hun-
dreds of gates. It is true that systems with much larger values of T2 are 
known, but such systems cannot be used to build NMR quantum computers 
of the current design as they do not have the spin-spin interactions necessary 
to build quantum gates. 
Other problems: Far more important than either of the problems discussed 
above are two other problems: the problem of selectively addressing spins, and 
the problem of the growth in the complexity of gates with increasing numbers 
of spins. 
The problem of selectively addressing different spins is simple to un-
derstand. In conventional quantum computers individual qubits are distin-
guished by the spatial locations of the corresponding physical systems, but 
this approach cannot be used in NMR. Instead qubits are distinguished by 
the different NMR transition frequencies of their corresponding spins. Unfor-
tunately this frequency range is rather narrow (typically only a few thousand 
Hz), and it is difficult to perform completely selective excitations on spins 
whose frequencies are close together [265]. This is one major source of the dis-
tortions clearly visible in the experimental spectra (Figs. 5.27-5.30). Clearly 
this problem will be more serious in systems with more spins, as it will be 
harder to ensure that all the spins are separated by substantial frequency 
gaps. 

5.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments 
187 
Because of this most authors have preferred to study heteronuclear spin 
systems, such as NMR computers based on the 1 H_13C spin pair in chloro-
form. This is much simpler than the corresponding homo nuclear problem, as 
the transition frequencies of the two spins now differ by hundreds of MHz, 
and spin-selective excitation is essentially trivial. This approach has allowed 
rapid progress with two spin and three spin systems, but it cannot be ex-
tended indefinitely as there are only a small number of different nuclei which 
are suitable, and in any event most NMR spectrometers are not capable of 
dealing with more than two or three different nuclei at the same time. Thus 
any NMR quantum computer involving more than a few qubits will have to 
face the problems of selectively addressing spins. 
A second, more subtle, problem is the increasing complexity of quantum 
logic gates in multispin systems. Ideally it would be possible to take a two 
qubit gate, developed for a two qubit computer, and use it in a three or four 
qubit computer without major modification. With NMR quantum computers 
this may prove tricky. The interactions which form the basis of gates, in 
particular spin-spin coupling, are part of the background NMR Hamiltonian, 
under which the spin system evolves in the absence of specific excitation. 
Quantum logic gates are formed by modulating the intensity of different 
elements of this background Hamiltonian, to give an effective Hamiltonian 
which has the desired form. This process, however, becomes more difficult in 
the presence of additional qubits, as it is necessary not only to modulate the 
interactions between the spins involved in the gate, but also to modulate any 
interactions with the additional spins so as to effectively remove them [266]. 
In the worst case a system of N spins has a total of ~ N (N + 1) one and 
two-spin interactions in the background Hamiltonian, of which only three are 
relevant to forming any particular two qubit gate. Although this problem is 
not quite as serious as it might initially appear [267]-[269] cancelling out all 
these irrelevant interactions may prove to be the hardest aspect of building 
NMR quantum computers with more than a handful of qubits. 
Alternative approaches: Mindful of the potential problems outlined above, 
some researchers have begun to think about radically different approaches to 
building quantum computers with NMR systems. So far none of these ideas 
have been demonstrated, and they bear little resemblance to "conventional" 
NMR quantum computers. 
One feature common to many of these speculative schemes is the use of 
solid samples instead of fluids. This has many significant consequences for 
NMR studies, both helpful and unhelpful. Individual molecules will remain 
approximately stationary in a sold sample, and so spatial localisation tech-
niques could in principle be used to selectively excite particular spins. The 
long wavelength of RF radiation precludes direct approaches, but techniques 
developed for NMR imaging [270] do allow spatial discrimination between 
spins. It will be difficult to achieve atomic resolution with this approach, 
however, partly because of the difficulty of constructing sufficiently powerful 

188 
5. Experiments Leading Toward Quantum Computation 
field gradients, but also because the low sensitivity of NMR makes it im-
practical to directly detect single spins [270]. Calculations suggest a limiting 
resolution of about Ip,m, so it will be necessary to use clusters of spins rather 
than individual nuclei. 
A second consequence of moving to the solid state is a substantial change 
in the NMR Hamiltonian, as anisotropic interactions are no longer averaged 
to their isotropic values. In particular the direct dipole-dipole coupling be-
tween spins is the largest spin-spin interaction. This coupling is much larger 
than scalar coupling, allowing the implementation of more rapid logic gates, 
but has the disadvantage that every spin is coupled to all other nearby spins. 
This makes it difficult to use the coupling in the selective manner needed for 
logic gates, and can also lead to rapid decoherence. 
A recent proposal due to Kane [271] confronts these problems in a most 
ingenious way, combing solid state NMR with conventional silicon microchip 
technology. It envisages the use of isolated 31 P atoms in a silicon matrix, with 
electrostatic gates, both to control the excitation of individual spins and to 
modulate couplings between them. Single spin detection would be achieved 
by using the nuclear spin to control a single electron transfer process. While 
this proposal is well beyond the scope of current technology, it is likely that 
many of the requirements will have been attained within the next ten years. 
5.4.7 Entanglement and Mixed States 
It has recently been suggested that NMR might not be a quantum mechanical 
technique at all! When assessing this claim, it should be remembered that 
"quantum mechanical" is used here with a technical meaning of "provably 
non-classical". As NMR experiments are conducted in the high tempera-
ture regime (kT is large compared with the splitting between energy levels), 
the density matrix describing a nuclear spin system is always close to the 
maximally mixed state, and such states can always be decomposed [272] as a 
mixture of product states (that is, states containing no entanglement between 
different nuclei). As NMR states are describable without invoking entangle-
ment, they can therefore be described using classical models (although these 
classical models may be somewhat contrived). However, while classical mod-
els can be used to describe an individual NMR state, it is not clear that such 
models can be used to describe the evolution of the state during an NMR 
experiment [273]. The significance of these conclusions remains controversial 
and unclear. 
5.4.8 The Next Few Years 
NMR provides the most powerful technology for implementing quantum com-
puters currently available, and is likely to remain so for several more years. 
Several small NMR quantum computers have been built, and quantum algo-
rithms have been implemented upon them. 

5.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments 
189 
In the next few years it seems likely that NMR computers with three 
to five qubits will become routine, and that larger systems will be under 
investigation. It seems unlikely, however, that NMR systems with many more 
than ten qubits will be built without a major change in approach. In the 
longer term, approaches such as Kane's solid state NMR computer may prove 
extremely promising. 

6. Quantum Networks 
and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
6.1 Introduction 
The basic concepts of quantum entanglement have been presented in previous 
chapters. In this chapter various advanced topics of quantum entanglement 
will be discussed. Section 6.2 describes a scheme for establishing entanglement 
between atoms at spatially separated nodes through the exchange of photons. 
In this way a quantum network can be built combining the virtues of trapped 
atom/ion systems, i.e. long storage times and local quantum state processing, 
with the advantages of quantum optics, i.e. flexible and reliable quantum 
communication over long distances. 
Section 6.3 addresses entangled states of more than two particles. Such 
states are not only important in the field of quantum information but were 
initially introduced by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (GHZ) to address 
the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) conflict of local realism with quantum 
mechanics in a most conclusive way. It is shown how three-photon GHZ 
entanglement can be generated and why entanglement between more than two 
particles illustrates quantum properties that are completely incomprehensible 
from any classical local-realistic viewpoint. 
In Sect. 6.4 it is shown that entanglement between more than two particles 
is a very delicate concept. In fact, entanglement between more than two par-
ticles cannot be defined in a unique way. Measures are introduced to quantify 
the entanglement, and related topics such as entanglement distillation and 
the relative entropy of entanglement will be explained.

6.2 Quantum Networks I: 
Entangling Particles at Separate Locations 
H.-J. Briegel, S. J. van Enk, J. 1. Cirac, and P. Zoller 
6.2.1 Interfacing Atoms and Photons 
Quantum networks consist of spatially separated nodes where qubits are 
stored and locally manipulated, and quantum communication channels con-
necting the nodes. Exchange of information within the network is accom-
plished by sending qubits through the channels. A physical implementation 
of such a network could consist e.g. of clusters of trapped atoms or ions repre-
senting the nodes, with optical fibres or similar photon "conduits" providing 
the quantum channels, as shown in Fig. 6.l. 
Atoms and ions are particularly well suited for storing qubits in long-lived 
internal states, and recently proposed schemes for performing quantum gates 
between trapped atoms or ions provide an attractive method for local pro-
cessing within an atom/ion node [156,274,275]. On the other hand, photons 
clearly represent the best qubit-carrier for fast and reliable communication 
over long distances [276, 277] . In this section, we describe a scheme [278] 
to implement an interface between the atoms and the photons, i.e. between 
the nodes and the communication channels of the network. This scheme al-
lows quantum transmission with (in principle) unit efficiency between distant 
atoms 1 and 2. The possibility of combining local quantum processing with 
quantum transmission between the nodes of the network opens the possibility 
for a variety of novel applications ranging from entangled-state cryptography 
[279] and teleportation [280] to more complex activities such as multi-particle 
communication and distributed quantum computing [281, 282]. 
The basic idea of the scheme is to utilise strong coupling between a high-
Q optical cavity and the atoms [276] forming a given node of the quantum 
network. By applying laser beams, one first transfers the internal state of 
Laser

an atom at the first node to the optical state of the cavity mode. The gen-
erated photons leak out of the cavity, propagate as a wavepacket along the 
transmission line, and enter an optical cavity at the second node. Finally, the 
optical state of the second cavity is transferred to the internal state of an 
atom. Multiple-qubit transmissions can be achieved by sequentially address-
ing pairs of atoms (one at each node) , as entanglements between arbitrarily 
located atoms are preserved by the state-mapping process. The distinguish-
ing feature of the protocol is that, by controlling the atom-cavity interaction, 
one can avoid the reflection of the wavepackets from the second cavity, effec-
tively switching off the dominant loss channel that would be responsible for 
decoherence in the communication process. 
6.2.2 Model of Quantum State Transmission 
A simple configuration of quantum transmission between two nodes consists 
of two atoms 1 and 2 which are strongly coupled to their respective cavity 
modes, see Fig. 6.2. 
The Hamiltonian describing the interaction of each atom with the corre-
sponding cavity mode is (Ii = 1): 
fIt = wca;at + wolr)t t(rl + g(lr)t ,(glat + h.c.) 
+~Dt(t) [e-t[WLtH,(tl]lr)tt(el +h.c.] 
(i = 1,2). 
(6.1) 
Here, at and a; are the annihilation and creation operators for cavity mode 
i with frequency We ' The states Ig) , Ir) , and Ie) form a three-level system of 
excitation frequency Wo (Fig. 6.2) , and the qubit is stored in a superposition 
of the two degenerate ground states. The states Ie) and Ig) are coupled by a 
Raman transition [274, 275, 283], where a laser of frequency WL excites the 
atom from Ie) to Ir) with a time-dependent Rabi frequency Dt(t) and phase 
¢t(t), followed by a transition Ir) ---+ Ie) which is accompanied by emission 
of a photon into the corresponding cavity mode, with coupling constant g. 
In order to suppress spontaneous emission from the excited state during the 
Raman process, we assume that the laser is strongly detuned from the atomic 
cavity 2

transition 1,11 » fl1,2(t), g, 1¢1,21 (with ,1 = WL - wo). In such a case, one 
can eliminate adiabatically the excited states Irk The new Hamiltonian for 
the dynamics of the two ground states becomes, in a rotating frame for the 
cavity modes at the laser frequency,

(6.2) 
The first term involves the Raman detuning 0 = WL -We' The next two terms 
are AC-Stark shifts of the ground states Ig) and Ie) due to the cavity mode 
and laser field, respectively, with ow,(t) = fl,(t)2/(4,1). The last term is the 
familiar Jaynes-Cummings interaction, with an effective coupling constant 
g,(t) = gfl,(t)/(2,1). Here we ignore for the moment the small effects pro-
duced by spontaneous emission during the Raman process. The notation Ie) 
as "excited" and Ig) as "ground" state is motivated by this analogy with the 
J aynes-Cummings Model. 
The aim is to select the time-dependent Rabi frequencies and laser phases1 
to accomplish the ideal quantum transmission

where cg,e are complex numbers; in general, they have to be replaced by 
unnormalised states of other "spectator" atoms in the network. In (6.3), 
10), and Ivac) represent the vacuum state of the cavity modes and the free 
electromagnetic modes connecting the cavities. Transmission will occur by 
photon exchange via these modes. 
In the present context, it is convenient to formulate the problem in the 
language of quantum trajectories [284, 285]. Let us consider a fictitious ex-
periment where the output field of the second cavity is continuously moni-
tored by a photodetector (see Fig. 6.2). The evolution of the quantum system 
under continuous observation, conditional upon observing a particular tra-
jectory of counts, can be described by a pure state wavefunction IlJie(t)) in 
the system Hilbert space (where the radiation modes outside the cavity have 
been eliminated). During the time intervals when no count is detected, this 
wavefunction evolves according to a Schrodinger equation with non-hermitian 
effective Hamiltonian 
(6.4) 
Here, '" is the cavity loss rate, which is assumed to be the same for the first 
and the second cavity. The detection of a count at time tr is associated with 
a quantum jump according to IlJie(tr + dt)) ex: cllJie(tr )), where c = iiI + ii2 
lOne could also modulate the cavity transmission, but this is technically more 
difficult. 

6.2 Quantum Networks I: Entangling Particles at Separate Locations

[285,286]. The probability density for a jump (detector click) to occur during 
the time interval from t to t + dt is (wc(t)lct clwc(t))dt [285, 286]. 
6.2.3 Laser Pulses for Ideal Transmission 
We wish to design the laser pulses in both cavities in such a way that ideal 
quantum transmission condition (6.3) is satisfied. A necessary condition for 
the time evolution is that a quantum jump (detector click, see Fig. 6.2) never 
occurs, i.e. clwc(t)) = 0 Vt, and thus the effective Hamiltonian will become a 
hermitian operator. In other words, the system will remain in a dark state of 
the cascaded quantum system. Physically, this means that the wavepacket is 
not reflected from the second cavity. We expand the state of the system as 
Iwc(t)) = Icglgg)IOO) 
+Ice [0:1 (t)e-UPl (t) leg) 100) + 0:2(t)e-'<P2(t) Ige) 100) 
+,81(t)lgg)I1O) + ,82(t)lgg)10l)]. 
(6.5) 
Ideal quantum transmission (6.3) will occur for 
(6.6) 
The first term on the RHS of (6.5) does not change under the time evolution 
generated by Heff. Defining symmetric and antisymmetric coefficients ,81,2 = 
(,8s =t= ,8a) /.;2, we find the following evolution equations 
a1(t) = gl(t),8a(t)/.;2, 
a2(t) = -g2 (t),8a (t)/.;2, 
(Ja(t) = -gl (t)O:l (t)/.;2 + g2(t)0:2(t)/.;2, 
(6.7) 
(6.8) 
(6.9) 
where we have chosen the laser frequencies WL +¢1,2(t) so that 8 = g2 /11 and 
¢1,2(t) = 8w.(t) 
(6.10) 
in order to compensate the AC-stark shifts; thus (6.7-6.9) are decoupled 
from the phases. The dark state conditwn implies ,8s(t) = 0, and therefore 
(6.11) 
as well as the normalisation condition 
(6.12) 
We note that the coefficients 0:1,2(t) and ,8s(t) are real. 
The mathematical problem is now to find pulse shapes f21,2(t) ex gl,2(t) 
such that the conditions (6.6-6.9, 6.11) are fulfilled. In general this is a dif-
ficult problem, as imposing conditions (6.6, 6.11) on the solutions of the 

196 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
differential equations (6.7-6.9) gives functional relations for the pulse shape 
whose solution are not obvious. We shall construct a class of solutions guided 
by the following physical idea. Let us consider that a photon leaks out of 
an optical cavity and propagates away as a wavepacket. Imagine that we 
were able to "time reverse" this wavepacket and send it back into the cav-
ity; then this would restore the original (unknown) superposition state of the 
atom, provided we would also reverse the timing of the laser pulses. If, on the 
other hand, we are able to drive the atom in a transmitting cavity in such a 
way that the outgoing pulse were already symmetric in time, the wavepacket 
entering a receiving cavity would "mimic" this time reversed process, thus 
"restoring" the state of the first atom in the second one. Thus, we look for 
solutions satisfying the symmetr'tc pulse condition 
(6.13) 
This implies Ctdt) = Ct2( -t), and (3a(t) = (3a(-t). The latter relation leads 
to a symmetric shape of the photon wavepacket propagating between the 
cavities. 
Suppose that we specify a pulse shape il1(t) ex 91(t) for the second half 
of the pulse in the first cavity (t ~ 0) 2. We wish to determine the first half 
ill (-t) ex 91 (-t) (for t > 0), such that the conditions for ideal transmission 
(6.3) are satisfied. From (6.6, 6.11) we have 
(t > 0). 
(6.14) 
Thus, the pulse shape is completely determined provided we know the system 
evolution for t ~ O. However, a difficulty arises when we try to find this 
evolution, since it depends on the yet unknown 92(t) = 91 (-t) for t > 0 [see 
(6.7-6.9)]. In order to circumvent this problem, we use (6.11) to eliminate 
this dependence in (6.7, 6.9). This gives 
Ct1(t) = 9dt)(3a(t)/..J2, 
/3a(t) = -",{3a(t) - ..J291(t)Ct1(t) 
(6.15) 
(6.16) 
for t ~ O. These equations have to be integrated with the initial conditions 
(6.17) 
(6.18) 
which follow immediately from Ct1(0) = Ct2(0), and (6.11, 6.12) at t = O. Given 
the solution of (6.15, 6.16), we can determine Ct2(t) from the normalisation 
2 .Q1(t) has to be such that 0:1(00) = O. This is fulfilled if .Q1(00) > 0, which also 
guarantees that the denominator in (6.14) does not vanish for t > O. 

6.3 Multi-Particle Entanglement 
197 
(6.12). In this way, the problem is solved since all the quantities appearing on 
the RHS of (6.14) are known for t 2: o. It is straightforward to find analytical 
expressions for the pulse shapes, for example by specifying J!l (t) = const for 
t > O. 
6.2.4 Imperfect Operations and Error Correction 
We have assumed that all operations involved in the transmission process, 
e.g. the state mapping from the atom to the cavity field via laser pulses, 
are perfect and did not pay special attention to absorption losses and deco-
herence in the communication channel. In reality, of course, such processes 
will always occur with a certain probability. The optical cavity~fibre system, 
together with the Raman pulses, is an example of a noisy quantum channel. 
Generally speaking, quantum noise tends to diminish the fidelity of the trans-
mission and to destroy the quantum correlations that are ideally established 
between the nodes. This effect becomes particularly dominant if the nodes 
are separated by a long distance, where long is defined in comparison with 
the coherence length and/or absorption length of the channel. Fortunately, 
since the advent of quantum error correction [287] and entanglement purifi-
cation [288], there are some tools to fight the effects of quantum noise and 
decoherence. In Sect. 8.6, we will describe how an efficient error correction 
can be implemented in above quantum network, correcting transmission er-
rors to all orders. This will allow communication with high fidelity over a 
short distance. For long distance communication, where the error probability 
grows exponentially with the length of the channel, we develop a concept 
of a quantum repeater that plays a role analogous to amplifiers in classical 
communication.

6.3.1 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states 
Entanglement between many particles is essential for most quantum commu-
nication schemes, e.g. error-correction schemes and secret key distribution 
networks, and for quantum computation. However, the original motivation 
for the discussion and the generation of entangled states for more than two 
particles, so called Greenberger~Horne~Zeilinger (GHZ) states, stems from a 
different direction [289, 290]. Namely from the debate about whether or not 
quantum mechanics is a complete theory. Although it is not the intention to 

198 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
give a detailed exposure of this fundamental philosophical discussion here, 
a brief presentation will be given in order for the reader to obtain a better 
understanding of the quantum information stored in many-particle entan-
gled system and why their quantum properties are in strong conflict with 
Einstein's notion of locality. The presentation is structured around an exper-
imental realisation of three-photon entanglement, which, in its own right, is 
important for the field of quantum information [291]. 
6.3.2 The Conflict with Local Realism 
Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger showed that quantum-mechanical predic-
tions for certain measurement results on three entangled particles are in 
conflict with local realism in cases where quantum theory makes definite, 
i.e. non-statistical, predictions [289]-[294]. This is in contrast to the case of 
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments with two entangled particles testing 
Bell's inequality, where the conflict with local realism only arises for statisti-
cal predictions [21, 23, 295, 296, 297]. 
How are the quantum predictions of a three-photon GHZ-state in stronger 
conflict with local realism than the conflict for two-photon states?3 To answer 
this, consider the state 
(6.19) 
where H and V denote horizontal and vertical polarisations. This state in-
dicates that the three photons are in a quantum superposition of the state 
I H)l I H)21 H)3 (all three photons are horizontally polarised) and the state 
I V) 1 I V) 2 I V) 3 (all three photons are vertically polarised). This specific state 
is symmetric with respect to the interchange of all photons which simplifies 
the arguments below, however the line of reasoning holds for any other max-
imally entangled three-photon state. 
Consider now some specific predictions following from state (6.19) for 
polarisation measurements on each photon in either a basis rotated through 
45° with respect to the original H IV basis, denoted by H'IV', or in a circular 
polarisation basis denoted by LI R (left-handed, right-handed). These new 
polarisation bases can be expressed in terms of the original ones as 
I H') = ~(I H) + IV)), 
I R) = ~ 
(I H) + i I V) ), 
IV') = ~(I H) -IV)), 
1 
IL) = j2(IH) -ilV))· 
(6.20) 
(6.21) 
Let us denote I H) by the vector (1,0) and I V) by the vector (0,1); they 
are thus the two eigenstates of Pauli operator (]" z, with the corresponding 
3 For two-photon states Hardy [298] has found situations where local realism pre-
dicts that a specific result occurs somet2mes and quantum mechanics predicts 
that the same result never occurs [299]. 

6.3 Multi-Particle Entanglement

eigenvalues +1 and -1. One can also easily verify that I H') and I V') or I R) 
and I L) are two eigenstates for Pauli operator U x or u y with the values +1 
and -1, respectively. We will refer to a measurement in the H'/V' basis as 
an x measurement and in the L/ R basis as a y measurement. 
Representing state (6.19) in the new bases one obtains predictions for 
measurements of these new polarisations. For example, in the case of mea-
surement of circular polarisation on, say, both photon 1 and 2, and mea-
surement of linear polarisation H' and V' on photon 3, denoted as a yyx 
measurement, the state becomes 
~ ( I R)l I L)21 H')3 + I L)l I R)21 H')3 
+ I R)l I R)21 V')3 + I L)l I L)21 V')3)' 
(6.22) 
This expression has a number of significant implications. Firstly, a specific 
result that is obtained in any individual or two-photon joint measurement is 
maximally random. For example, photon 1 will exhibit polarisation R or L 
with the same probability of 50%. 
Secondly, because only those terms yielding a -1 product for a yyx mea-
surement appear in the expression, one realises that, given the results of mea-
surements on two photons, it is possible to predict with certainty what the 
result of a corresponding measurement performed on the third photon will be. 
For example, suppose photon 1 and 2 are both found to exhibit right-handed 
(R) circular polarisation (i.e., both having the value + 1). By the third term 
in the expression above, photon 3 will definitely be V' polarised (i.e., having 
the value -1). 
By cyclic permutation, analogous expressions are obtained for any case 
of the measurement of circular polarisation on two photons and V'- H' po-
larisation on the remaining one. Again, only those terms which give a -1 
product are the possible outcomes in a yxy or an xyy measurement. Thus, 
the measurement result both for circular polarisation and for linear H', V' 
polarisation can be predicted with certainty for anyone of these photons 
given the result of appropriate measurements on the other two. 
Now let us analyse the implications of these predictions from the point of 
view of local realism. First note that the predictions are independent of the 
spatial separation of the photons and independent of the relative time order 
of the measurements. Let us thus consider the experiment to be performed 
such that the three measurements are performed simultaneously in a given 
reference frame, say, for conceptual simplicity, in the reference frame of the 
source. Employing the notion of Einstein locality implies that no information 
can travel faster than the speed of light. Hence the specific measurement re-
sult obtained for any photon must not depend on which specific measurement 
is performed simultaneously on the other two nor on the outcome of these 
measurements. The only way then to explain from a local realist point of 
view the perfect correlations discussed above is to assume that each photon 

200 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
carries elements of reality for all the measurements considered and that these 
elements of reality determine the specific measurement result [289, 290, 294]. 
Let us now consider a measurement of linear H', V' polarisation on all 
three photons, i.e. an xxx measurement. What outcomes are possible here if 
elements of reality exist? State (6.19) and its permutations imply that when-
ever the result H' [V'] is obtained for anyone photon, the other two photons 
must carry opposite [identical] circular polarisations. Suppose that for three 
specific photons, one finds, say, the result V' for photons 2 and 3. Because 
photon 3 is a V', both photon 1 and 2 must carry identical circular polarisa-
tions; and because photon 2 is a V', both photons 1 and 3 must carry identi-
cal circular polarisations. Clearly, if these circular polarisations are elements 
of reality, then all three photons must carry identical circular polarisations. 
Thus, if photons 2 and 3 have identical circular polarisations, then photon 1 
must necessarily carry linear polarisation V'. Thus the existence of elements 
of reality leads to the conclusion that the result IV{) IVI) IV£) is one possible 
outcome if one elects to measure H', V' polarisations of all three particles, 
i.e. if an xxx measurement is performed. By parallel constructions, one can 
verify that the only four possible outcomes are 
(6.23) 
How do these predictions of local realism compare with those of quantum 
physics? Expressing the state given in (6.19) in terms of H', V' polarisation 
yields 
~ ( I H')l I H')21 H')3 + I H')l I V')21 V')3 
+ I V')l I H')21 V')3 + I V')l I V')21 H')3 ). 
(6.24) 
Comparing the terms given in (6.23) with the terms in (6.24) one observes 
that whenever local realism predicts that a specific result definitely occurs 
for a measurement on one of the photons given the results for the other two, 
quantum physics definitely predicts the opposite result. Thus, while in the 
case of Bell's inequalities for two photons the difference between local realism 
and quantum physics happens for statistical predictions of the theory, here 
any statistics is only due to inevitable measurement errors occurring in any 
and every experiment of classical or quantum physics. 
6.3.3 A Source for Three-Photon GHZ Entanglement 
Proposals for the creation of entanglement between more than two particles 
have been made for experiments with photons [300], atoms [301] and ions 
(see Sect. 4.3), and three nuclear spins within a single molecule have been 
prepared such that they locally exhibit three-particle correlations [302]. In 
this section the first experimental observation of polarisation entanglement 
of three spatially separated photons is described [291]. The method used for

Fig. 6.3. Schematic drawing of the experimental setup for the demonstration of 
Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger entanglement for spatially separated photons. Condi-
tional on the registration of one photon at the trigger detector T, the three photons 
registered at D 1 , D2 , and D3 exhibit the desired GHZ correlations. 
the experiment is a further development of the techniques that have been used 
in experiments on quantum teleportation [76] (Sect. 3.7) and entanglement 
swapping [86] (Sect. 3.10). 
As proposed in Ref. [300], the main idea is to transform two pairs of 
polarisation entangled photons into three entangled photons and a fourth 
independent photon. 4 Figure 6.3 is a schematic drawing of the experimental 
setup. Pairs of polarisation entangled photons are generated by a 200 fs pulse 
of UV-light which passes through a BBO crystal (see Sect. 3.4.4). The pair 
creation is such that the following polarisation entangled state is obtained 
[26]: 
(6.25) 
This state represents a superposition of the possibility that the photon in 
arm a is horizontally polarised and the one in arm b is vertically polarised 
I H) a I V) b' with the opposite possibility I V) a I H) b' 
In the rare event that two such pairs are created by the passage of a single 
UV pulse through the crystal the setup is designed such that detection of one 
photon at each of the four detectors (four-fold coincidence) corresponds to 
the observation of the state 
4 The method developed to obtain three-particle entanglement from a source of 
pairs of entangled particles can be extended to obtain entanglement between 
many more particles [303J.

6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
(6.26) 
by the detectors Dl, D2 and D3. This can be understood in the following way. 
When a four-fold coincidence recording is obtained, one photon in path a must 
have been transmitted by the polarising beamsplitter (Pol BS) in path a and 
therefore must have had horizontal polarisation upon detection by the trigger 
detector T. Its companion photon in path b must then be vertically polarised, 
and it has 50% chance of being transmitted by the beamsplitter (see Fig. 6.3) 
towards detector D3 and 50% chance of being reflected by the beamsplitter 
towards the final polarising beamsplitter where it will be reflected to D2 • In 
the former case, the counts at detectors Dl and D2 are due to the second 
pair. One photon of this second pair travels via path a and must necessarily 
be V polarised in order to be reflected by the polarising beamsplitter in path 
a; thus its companion, taking path b, must be H polarised and after reflection 
at the beamsplitter in path b (with a 50% probability) it will be transmitted 
by the final polarising beamsplitter and arrive at detector Dl . The photon 
detected by D2 therefore must be H polarised since it came via path a and 
had to transit the last polarising beamsplitter. Note that this latter photon 
was initially V polarised but after passing the >../2 plate (at 22.5°) it became 
polarised at 45° which gave it a 50% chance of arriving as an H polarised 
photon at detector D2 . Thus one concludes that if the photon detected by 
D3 is the companion of the T photon, then the coincidence detection by Dl , 
D2, and D3 corresponds to the detection of the state 
(6.27) 
By a similar argument one can show that if the photon detected by D2 is 
the companion of the T photon, the coincidence detection by Dl , D2, and D3 
corresponds to the detection of the state 
(6.28) 
In general, the two possible states (6.27) and (6.28) corresponding to a 
four-fold coincidence recording will not form a coherent superposition, i.e. 
a GHZ state, because they could, in principle, be distinguishable. Besides 
possible lack of mode overlap at the detectors, the exact detection time of 
each photon can reveal which state is present. For example, state (6.27) is 
identified by noting that T and D3, or Dl and D2, fire nearly simultane-
ously. To erase this information it is necessary that the coherence time of the 
photons is substantially longer than the duration of the UV pulse (approx. 
200 fs) [304]. This can be achieved by detecting the photons behind narrow 
band-width filters (3.6 nm bandwidth) which yield a coherence time of ap-
prox. 500 fs. Thus, the potential to distinguish between states (6.27) and 
(6.28) largely vanishes, and, by a basic rule of quantum mechanics, the state 
detected .by a coincidence recording of Dl , D2, and D3, conditional on the 

6.3 Multi-Particle Entanglement 
203 
trigger T, is the quantum superposition given in (6.26). Rigorously speaking, 
this erasure technique is perfect, hence produces a pure GHZ state, only in 
the limit of infinitesimal pulse duration and infinitesimal filter bandwidth, 
but detailed calculations [305] reveal that the experimental parameters given 
above are sufficient to create a clearly observable entanglement, up to about 
80% purity, consistent with the experimental data given below. The plus sign 
in (6.26) follows from the following more formal derivation. Consider two 
down-conversions producing the product state 
(6.29) 
Here it is initially assumed that the components 1 H) band 1 V) b created in 
a, 
a, 
one down-conversion might be distinguishable from the components 1 H)~.b 
and 1 V)~.b created in the other one. The evolution of the individual compo-
nents of state (6.29) through the apparatus towards the detectors T, D 1 , D2 , 
and D3 is given by 
Identical expressions hold for the primed components. Inserting these expres-
sions into state (6.29) and restricting ourselves to those terms where only one 
photon is found in each output we obtain 
-
\ 
{ 1 H)T (I V)~ !V)21 H)~ + 1 H)~ 1 H); !V)3) 
4v2 
+ 1 H)~ (I V)l 1 V); 1 H)3 + 1 H)l 1 H)21 V);) } . 
(6.32) 
If the experiment is now performed such that the photon states from the two 
down-conversions are indistinguishable, one finally obtains the desired state 
(up to an overall minus sign) 
(6.33) 
Note that the total photon state produced by the setup, i.e .. the state before 
detection, also contains terms in which, for example, two photons enter the 
same detector. In addition, the total state contains contributions from single 
down-conversions. The four-fold coincidence detection acts as a projection 
measurement onto the desired GHZ state (6.33) and filters out the unwanted 
terms. The efficiency for one UV pump pulse to yield such a four-fold coin-
cidence detection is very low (of the order of 10- 1°). Fortunately, 7.6 x 107 
UV-pulses are generated per second, which yields about one double pair cre-
ation and detection per 150 seconds. Triple and multiple pair creations can 
be completely neglected.

6.3.4 Experimental Proof of GHZ Entanglement 
To experimentally demonstrate that GHZ entanglement can be obtained by 
the method described above, one first has to verify that, conditional on a pho-
ton detection by the trigger T, both the HIH2 V3 and the VI V2H3 component 
are present and no others. This was done by comparing the count rates of the 
eight possible combinations of polarisation measurements, H1H2H3 , HIH2 V 3, 
... , VI V 2 V 3. The observed intensity ratio between the desired and undesired 
states was 12:l. Existence of the two terms as just demonstrated is a neces-
sary but not yet sufficient condition for demonstrating GHZ entanglement. In 
fact, there could in principle be just a statistical mixture of those two states. 
Therefore, one has to prove that the two terms coherently superpose. This 
was done by a measurement of linear polarisation of photon 1 along +45°, 
bisecting the H and V direction. Such a measurement projects photon 1 into 
the superposition 
(6.34) 
which implies that the state (6.33) is projected into 
(6.35) 
Thus photon 2 and 3 end up entangled as predicted under the notion of 
"entangled entanglement" [306]. Rewriting the state of photon 2 and 3 in the 
45° basis results in the state 
(6.36) 
This means that if photon 2 is found to be polarised along -45°, pho-
ton 3 is also polarised along the same direction. The absence of the terms 
1 +45°)21-45°)3 and 1-45°)21 +45°)3 is due to destructive interference and 
thus indicates the desired coherent superposition of the terms in the GHZ 
state (6.33). The experiment therefore consisted of measuring four-fold coin-
cidences between the detector T, detector 1 behind a +45° polariser, detector 
2 behind a-45° polariser, and measuring photon 3 behind either a +45° po-
lariser or a-45° polariser. In the experiment, the difference in arrival time 
of the photons at the final polariser, or more specifically, at the detectors Dl 
and D2, was varied. 
The data points in Fig. 6.4a are the experimental results obtained for the 
polarisation analysis of the photon at D3, conditioned on the trigger and the 
detection of two photons polarised at 45° and -45° by the two detectors DI 
and D2 , respectively. 
The two curves show the four-fold coincidences for a polariser oriented at 
-45° (squares) and +45° (circles) in front of detector D3 as function of the

Fig. 6.4. Experimental confirmation of GHZ entanglement. Graph (a) shows the 
results obtained for polarisation analysis of the photon at D3 , conditional on the 
trigger and the detection of one photon at Dl polarised at 45° and one photon 
at detector D2 polarised -45 0 • The two curves show the four-fold coincidences 
for a polariser oriented at -45 0 and 45 0 respectively in front of detector D3 as 
function of the spatial delay in path a. The difference between the two curves at 
zero delay confirms the GHZ entanglement. By comparison (graph (b)) no such 
intensity difference is found, as predicted, if the polariser in front of detector Dl is 
set at 00 • 
spatial delay in path a. From the two curves it follows that for zero delay the 
polarisation of the photon at D3 is oriented along -45 0 , in accordance with 
the quantum-mechanical predictions for the GHZ state. For non-zero delay, 
the photons travelling via path a towards the second polarising beamsplitter 
and those traveling via path b become distinguishable. Therefore increasing 
the delay gradually destroys the quantum superposition in the three-particle 
state. 
Note that one can equally well conclude from the data that at zero delay, 
the photons at Dl and D3 have been projected onto a two-particle entangled 
state by the projection of the photon at D2 onto -45°. The two conclusions 
are only compatible for a genuine GHZ state. 
For an additional confirmation of state (6.33) measurements have been 
performed conditional on the detection of the photon at DJ under 0° polarisa-
tion (i.e. V polarisation). For the GHZ state (1/ V2)(H1H2 V 3 + VI V2H3 ) this 
implies that the remaining two photons should be in the state V 2H3 which 
cannot give rise to any correlation between these two photons in the 45° de-
tection basis. The experimental results of these measurement are presented 
in Fig. 6.4b. The data clearly indicate the absence of two-photon correlations 
and thereby confirm the observation of GHZ entanglement between three 
spatially separated photons. 
Recall that the GHZ entanglement is only observed under the condition 
that both the trigger photon and the three entangled photons are detected. 

206 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
This implies that the four-fold coincidence detection plays the double role 
both of projecting into the desired GHZ state (6.26) and of performing a 
specific measurement on the state. 
This might raise doubts about whether such a source can be used to test 
local realism. Actually the same doubts had also been raised for the former 
Bell-type experiments involving indistinguishability of photons [307, 308]. 
Although these experiments have successfully produced certain long-distance 
quantum-mechanical correlations, in the past it was generally believed [309], 
[310] that they could never, not even their idealised versions, be considered as 
genuine tests of local realism. However, Popescu, Hardy and Zukowski [311] 
showed that this general belief is wrong and that the above experiments in-
deed constitute (modulo the usual detection loopholes) true tests of local 
realism. Following the same line of reasoning, Zukowski [312] has shown that 
the above GHZ entanglement source enables one to perform a three-particle 
test of local realism. In essence, the GHZ argument for testing local realism 
is based on detection events and knowledge of the underlying quantum state 
is not even necessary. It is indeed enough to consider only the four-fold co-
incidences discussed above and ignore totally the contributions by the other 
terms. 
6.3.5 Experimental Test of Local Realism 
Versus Quantum Mechanics 
How can one experimentally address the conflict between local realism and 
quantum mechanics using the GHZ entanglement source described in the 
previous section? As explained in Sect. 6.3.2, one first has to perform a set 
of experiments for yyx, yxy and xyy. Each of the three experiments has in 
principle 23 possible outcomes. 
Figure 6.5 indicates the experimentally obtained probabilities for each 
of the 3 x 23 possible outcomes. Here, in order to compare with the GHZ 
reasoning for state (6.19) given in Sect. 6.3.2, we have simply redefined the 
polarisation states of photon 3 in (6.26), that is, the notation I Hh and I V)3 
have been interchanged. 
From the values of the maxima and minima in Fig. 6.5 one concludes 
that with 71 %±4 % accuracy, i.e. with a visibility of ( (max) - (min) ) / ( (max) + 
(min)) = 0.71 ±0.04, the terms that are expected to be present and those that 
are expected to be absent can be identified. Although the limited visibility 
is mainly explained by the finite length of the pump-pulse and the finite 
bandwidth of the frequency filters (see Sect. 6.3.3), it is appropriate, if not 
compulsory, for a fundamental test of local realism versus quantum mechanics 
to consider the data shown in Fig. 6.5 as being obtained from measurements 
on an ensemble of three particles emerging from a black box. In this way 
no presuppositions about the source of GHZ entanglement are included in 
the following demonstration of the conflict with local realism. From the data 
in Fig. 6.5, and taking a local realistic point of view, i.e., assuming that

which are in strong conflict with the local realistic predictions and in agreement

The predictions following from quantum mechanics are shown in Fig. 6.6b. 
These later predictions follow from the argument that the data in Fig. 6.5 
indicate the presence of entangled three-particle systems with a purity of 

6.3 Multi-Particle Entanglement 
209 
about 71 %. Finally, Fig. 6.6c shows the experimental results for an xxx mea-
surement. 
The results are in strong conflict with the local realism predictions and in 
full agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions. Actually, within the 
experimental uncertainty, the experimental data clearly show that only those 
triple coincidences predicted by quantum mechanics, see (6.24), occur and 
that those predicted by local realism, see (6.23), are absent. In this sense, the 
described experiment constitutes the first three-particle test of local realism 
without inequalities [313]. 
Since no real experiment can fully fulfill the perfect correlation condition 
required by the original reasoning of GHZ, a local realist may argue that 
the GHZ predictions can never be perfectly tested in the laboratory and thus 
he/she might not be convinced by the above analysis. To face this difficulty, a 
number of Bell-type inequalities for N-particle GHZ states have been derived 
[314]-[316]. All these works show that quantum mechanical predictions for 
GHZ states violate these inequalities by an amount that grows exponentially 
with N. For instance, the optimal Bell-type inequality for a three-particle 
GHZ state given by Mermin reads as follows 
I (xYY) + (yxy) + (yyx) - (xxx)1 ::; 2, 
(6.37) 
where, for example, (xyy) denotes the expectation value of the product of 
the eigenvalues for x, y, and y, measurements on particles 1, 2, and 3, re-
spectively. The necessary visibility to violate this Bell-type inequality for a 
three-particle GHZ state is 50% [314]. The visibility observed in the above 
GHZ experiment is about 70% and clearly surpasses the 50% limit. Substi-
tuting the experimental results into the left-hand side of inequality (6.37) 
gives 
I(xxy) + (yxy) + (yyx) - (xxx)1 = 2.83 ± 0.09. 
(6.38) 
Therefore, the experimental results violate the inequality (6.37) by over 9 
standard deviations, which concludes the demonstration of the conflict with 
local realism. It should be pointed out that the above test does not provides 
the final verdict for local realistic theories. Some "loopholes" are still open 
since the experiments have not been performed with a high-efficiency and 
space-like separated detection method.

6.4.1 Schmidt Decomposition and von Neumann Entropy 
A composite quantum system is one that consists of a number of quantum 
subsystems. When those subsystems are entangled it is impossible to ascribe 
a definite state vector to anyone of them. A simple example of a com-
posite quantum system is a pair of two polarisation entangled photons (see 
Sect. 3.4.4). The composite system is mathematically described by 
1 
!W-h2 = J2(!HhlVh -lVh!H)2). 
(6.39) 
The property that is described is that the direction of polarisation of the 
two photons is orthogonal along any axis. One can immediately see from 
(6.39) that neither of the photons possesses a definite state (polarisation) 
vector. The best that one can say is that if a measurement is made on one 
photon, and it is found, say, to be vertically polarised (IV)), then the other 
photon is certain to be horizontally polarised (!H)). This type of description 
however can not be applied to a general composite system, unless the former 
is written in a special form. This motivates us to introduce the so called 
Schmidt decomposition [317], which not only is mathematically convenient, 
but also gives a deeper insight into correlations between the two subsystems. 
The Schmidt decomposition shows that any state of two subsystems A 
and B (one of dimension N and the other of dimension M 
~ N) can be 
written as 
N 
!WAB) = Lc,!ut)!Vt) , 
( 6.40) 
,=1 
where {!ut)} is a basis for subsystem A and {!v,)} is a basis for subsystem 
B. There are two important observations to be made, which are absolutely 
fundamental to understanding correlations between the two subsystems in a 
joint pure state: 
• The reduced density matrices of both subsystems, written in the Schmidt 
basis, are diagonal and have the same positive spectrum. We find the 
reduced density matrix of the subsystem A by tracing the joint state 
PAB = !W AB) (W AB! over all states of the subsystem B, so that 
(6.41) 
q 
p 

6.4 Entanglement Quantification 
211 
• If a subsystem is N dimensional it can be entangled with no more than N 
orthogonal states of another one. 
We would like to point out that the Schmidt decomposition is, in general, 
impossible for more than two entangled subsystems. Mathematical details 
of this fact are exposed in [318]. To clarify this, however, we consider three 
entangled subsystems as an example. Here, our intention would be to write 
a general state such that by observing the state of the one of the subsystems 
would instantaneously and with certainty tell us the state of the other two. 
But this is impossible in general since one can perform a measurement on one 
of the three subsystems such that the remaining two subsystems are entan-
gled systems (see Sect. 6.3.4). Clearly, involvement of even more subsystems 
complicates this analysis even further. The same reasoning applies to mixed 
states of two or more subsystems (i.e. states whose density operator is not 
idempotent p2 f p), for which we cannot have the Schmidt decomposition in 
general. This reason alone is responsible for the fact that the entanglement of 
two subsystems in a pure state is simple to understand and quantify, while for 
mixed states, or states consisting of more than two subsystems, the question 
is much more involved. 
To quantify entanglement in a pure state of two subsystems we introduce 
the following "measure of uncertainty" in a state of a quantum system. 
Definition. The von Neumann entropy of a quantum system described by a 
density matrix p is defined as [319] 
SN(p) := ~Tr(plnp) . 
(6.42) 
(We will drop the subscript N whenever there is no possibility of confusion). 
So entanglement between A and B can be understood as follows. The un-
certainty in the system B before we measured A is S (p B), where p B is the 
reduced density matrix of system B. After the measurement there is no un-
certainty, i.e. if we obtain {Iu,)} for A, then we know that the state of B 
is {I v,)}. So the information gained is S (p B) = S (p A)' Thus A and Bare 
most entangled when their reduced density matrices are maximally mixed. 
Specialising to two qubits, a maximally entangled state is e.g. ~ (100) + Ill)). 
There is also another physical interpretation of this measure of entan-
glement for pure states. Namely it can be shown [117] that the amount of 
entanglement that can be distilled locally from a pure state of the form 
aIOO) + bill) is limited by the reduced entropy of that pure state. On the 
other hand, if we want to create, by local operations, an ensemble of systems 
each in the state aIOO) + bill) then the average amount of entanglement per 
pair that we need to share initially is again given by the reduced entropy of 
that pure state. 
For mixed states the Schmidt decomposition no longer exists, so that 
the reduced entropy is no longer a good measure of entanglement. A way 
to proceed in quantifying entanglement turns out to be via entanglement

Fig. 6.1. Quantum state purification methods allow local general measurements as 
indicated by the dashed boxes. An additional multilevel system interacts with our 
qubit and subsequently the multilevel system is measured. This is the most general 
form of measurement. Also allowed is classical communication, here symbolised by 
the telephones. 
purification procedures. We first formalise general purification procedures and 
then, based on that, show three different ways of quantifying entanglement. 
6.4.2 Purification Procedures 
There are three different ingredients involved in procedures aiming at distill-
ing locally a sub ensemble of highly entangled states from an original ensemble 
of less entangled states. 
1. Local general measurements (LGM): these are performed by the two par-
ties A and B separately and are described by two sets of operators sat-
isfying the completeness relations I:t A; At = I and I:J B] BJ = I. The 
joint action of the two is described by I:tJ At 0 BJ = I:t At 0 I:J B J , 
which is again a complete general measurement, and obviously local. Any 
local general measurement on a system can be implemented by letting 
it interact with an additional system and then measuring this additional 
system. The situation is depicted in Fig. 6.7. 
2. Classical communication (CC): this means that the actions of A and B 
can be correlated. This can be described by a complete measurement on 
the whole space A + B and is not necessarily decomposable into a sum of 
direct products of individual operators (as in LGM). If PAB describes the 
initial state shared between A and B then the transformation involving 
'LGM+CC' would look like

Fig. 6.8. Subselection according to the result of local measurements is the key 
ingredient of a quantum state purification procedure. The initial ensemble [ is 
decomposed into subensembles [,. Some of these subensembles may have a higher 
entanglement per pair than the original ensemble. 
(6.43) 
i.e. the actions of A and B are 'correlated'. 
3. Post-selectwn (PS) is performed on the final ensemble according to 
the above two procedures (Illustrated in Fig. 6.8). Mathematically this 
amounts to the general measurement not being complete, i.e. we leave 
out some operations. The density matrix describing the newly obtained 
ensemble (the sub ensemble of the original one) has to be renormalised 
accordingly. Suppose that we kept only the pairs where we had an out-
come corresponding to the operators A, and BJ , then the state of the 
chosen sub ensemble would be 
,

PAB -------7

t' 
Tr(A, ® BJ PAB A, ® BJ ) 
(6.44) 
where the denominator provides the necessary normalisation. 
Any manipulation involving either of the above three elements or their com-
bination is called a purification procedure. It should be noted that the three 
operations described above are local. This implies that the entanglement of 
the total ensemble cannot increase under these operations. However, classical 
correlations between the two subsystems can be increased, even for the whole 
ensemble, if we allow classical communication. 
We assume the following definition: a state P AB is disentangled (also called 
separable) if and only if 
(6.45) 

214 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
where I:, p, = 1 and p, ~ 0 for all i. Otherwise it is said to be entangled. 
Note that all the states in the above expansion can be pure. This is because 
each P' can be expanded in terms of its eigenvectors. So, in the above sum 
we can in addition require that PA 2 = PA and PH 2 = PH for all i. This fact 
will be used later in this section. 
6.4.3 Conditions for Entanglement Measures 
It can be proven that, out of certain states, it is possible to distill maximally 
entangled states by means of LGM+CC+PS a subensemble of maximally en-
tangled states [50]. The disentangled states, of course, yield no entanglement 
through purification, but the converse is not true in general; namely, if a 
state is entangled then this does not necessarily imply that it can be purified 
[320]. The question remains open as to how much entanglement a certain 
state contains. This question is not entirely well defined unless we state what 
physical circumstances characterise the amount of entanglement. This imme-
diately implies that a measure of entanglement is non-unique, as will be seen 
shortly. Before we define three different measures of entanglement we state 
four conditions that every measure of entanglement has to satisfy [321, 322]. 
El. E(a-) = 0 iff a- is separable. 
E2. Local unitary operations leave E(a-) invariant, i.e. E(a-) = E(UA i8l 
uBa-ul i8l Uk)· 
E3. The expected entanglement cannot increase under LGM+CC+PS given 
by I: v.tv" = I, i.e. 
L tr(a-,) E(a-,/tr(a-,)) ~ E(a-) , 
(6.46) 
where a-, = v"a-v.t. 
E4. For pure states the measure of entanglement has to reduce to the entropy 
of the reduced density operator. 
Condition E1 ensures that disentangled and only disentangled states have a 
zero value of entanglement. Condition E2 ensures that a local change of basis 
has no effect on the amount of entanglement. Condition E3 is intended to 
abolish the possibility of increasing entanglement by performing local mea-
surements aided by classical communication. It takes into account the fact 
that we have a certain knowledge of the final state. Namely, when we start 
with n states a- we know exactly which m, = nx Tr(a-,) pairs will end up 
in the state a-, after performing a purification procedure. Therefore we can 
separately access the entanglement in each of the possible subensembles de-
scribed by a-,. Clearly the total entanglement at the end should not exceed 
the original entanglement, which is stated in E3. This, of course, does not 
exclude the possibility that we can select a sub ensemble whose entanglement 
per pair is higher than the original entanglement per pair. The fourth con-
dition has been introduced as a consistency criterion because the measure 

6.4 Entanglement Quantification 
215 
of entanglement for pure states is unique. We now introduce three different 
measures of entanglement which obey EI-E4. Note that we might wish to 
relax condition E4. This would allow us more possible measures of entan-
glement which might have applications in special situations. We will give an 
example later in this section. 
First we discuss the entanglement of formation (sometimes also called the 
entanglement of creation) [323]. Bennett et al. define the entanglement of 
creation of a state p by 
(6.4 7) 
where S(PA) = -TrpAlnpA is the von Neumann entropy and the minimum 
is taken over all the possible realisations of the state, PAB = 2:J PJ 11J})) (1J}J I 
with PA = Tr B (11J},) (1J}, I)· The entanglement of creation cannot be increased 
by the combined action of LGM+CC and therefore satisfies all the four con-
ditions EI-E4 [323]. The physical basis of this measure presents the number 
of singlets that must be invested in order to create a given entangled state. 
It should also be added that a closed form of this measure has been found 
recently [324]. 
Related to this measure is the entanglement of distillation [323]. It defines 
an amount of entanglement of a state (J' as a proportion of singlets that can 
be distilled using a purification procedure. As such it is dependent on the 
efficiency of a particular purification procedure and can be made more general 
only by introducing some sort of universal purification procedure. Unlike the 
entanglement of formation there is no closed form analytical expression for the 
entanglement of distillation. However, some upper bounds can be provided 
and we come back to this later. 
We now introduce a third measure of entanglement which may actually 
give rise to a whole family of good entanglement measures. It can be seen 
that this measure is intimately related to the entanglement of distillation by 
providing an upper bound for it [322]. 
If D is the set of all disentangled states (see Fig. 6.9), the measure of 
entanglement for a state (J' is then defined as 
E((J') := min 
D((J'llp) , 
pED 
(6.48) 
where D is any measure of distance (not necessarily a metric) between the 
two density matrices P and (J' such that E((J') satisfies the above conditions 
E1-E4. 
Now an important question is what condition a candidate for D( (J'llp) 
has to satisfy in order for E1-E4 to hold for the entanglement measure? 
Necessary and sufficient conditions are not known, although a set of sufficient 
conditions exists [321]. Without going into any mathematical detail (see [322] 
if necessary) we present one measure that satisfies E1-E4 and one measure 
that only satisfies E1-E3.

Fig. 6.9. The set of all density matrices, T is represented by the outer circle. Its 
subset, a set of disentangled states V is represented by the inner circle. A state 
a belongs to the entangled states, and p* is the disentangled state that minimises 
the distance D(allp), thus representing the amount of quantum correlations in a. 
State PA ® P<S is obtained by tracing p* over A and B. D(p* IlpA ® p<S) represent 
the classical part of the correlations in the state a. 
6.4.4 Two Measures of Distance Between Density Matrices 
We first state that EI-E4 hold for the quantum relative entropy, i.e. when 
D(allp) = S(allp) := Tr {a(lna -lnp)} [322]. Note that the quantum rela-
tive entropy is not a true metric, as it is not symmetric and does not satisfy 
the triangle inequality. In the next subsection the reasons for this will be-
come clear. A question arises as to why the entanglement is not defined as 
E(a) = minpED S(plla). Since the quantum relative entropy is asymmetric 
this gives a different result to the original definition. However, the major prob-
lem with this convention is that for maximally entangled states this measure 
is infinite. Although this does have a sound statistical interpretation (see the 
next section) it is hard to relate it to any physically reasonable scheme (e.g. 
a purification procedure). This is the prime reason for excluding this conven-
tion from any further considerations. The measure of entanglement generated 
by the quantum relative entropy will hereafter be referred to as the relative 
entropy of entanglement. An important result is that (for a proof see [322]) 
Theorem. For pure states the relative entropy of entanglement is equal to 
the von Neumann reduced entropy. 
This is physically a very satisfying property of an entanglement measure, 
because it is already known that for pure states the von Neumann reduced 
entropy is a good measure of entanglement. 

6.4 Entanglement Quantification 
217 
We also state an important result, that the entanglement of creation Ec is 
never smaller than the relative entropy measure of entanglement E. We will 
show later that this property has the important implication that the amount 
of entanglement that we have to invest to create a given quantum state is 
usually larger than the entanglement that one can recover using quantum 
state distillation methods. 
Theorem. Ec(u) :::; E(u) = minpED S(ullp), 
We add that both the entanglement of creation and the relative entropy 
of entanglement can be calculated easily for the Bell diagonal states [321]. It 
turns out that for these states the entanglement of formation is substantially 
larger than the relative entropy of entanglement. 
A "closed form" for the relative entropy of entanglement is not yet known, 
and a computer search is necessary to find the minimum p*, for each given u. 
However, we can numerically find the amount of entanglement for two spin-
1/2 particles very efficiently using methods described in the next section. 
An example of a measure of entanglement that satisfies conditions E1-
E3 but not E4 is given by the (modified) Bures metric, i.e. when D(ullp) = 
DB(ullp) := 2 - 2F(u, p), where F(u, p) := [Tr{ JPu JPp/2j 2 is the so-called 
fidelity (or Uhlmann's transition probability). We can, as in the case of the 
quantum relative entropy, calculate the measure of entanglement in this case 
for some simple states. For example, for maximally entangled states we obtain 
E = 1. Following the lines of the above proof it can be shown that for a general 
pure state aIOO) + ,BI11)5 the entanglement is 4a2;32. In general, a computer 
search is necessary, as in the previous case. We now turn to describing this 
general computer calculation of a relative entropy of entanglement. 
6.4.5 Numerics for Two Spin 1/2 Particles 
As there is no closed analytical formula for the relative entropy of entangle-
ment, we have to resort to a numerical search to find the entanglement of 
a general quantum state u. Such a search can be performed efficiently using 
some results from convex analysis [325]. In the following we introduce one ba-
sic definition and one important result from convex analysis [325]. From this 
point onwards we concentrate on the quantum relative entropy as a measure 
of entanglement although most of the considerations are of a more general 
nature. The following theorem is crucial for our minimisation problem as it 
shows that we do not have to have an infinite number of parameters in the 
decomposition of a disentangled state in (6.45) to search over.

1, ... , N + 1, Pn 2: a and an E A. 
5 That this is, indeed, the most general form can be seen for the Schmidt decom-
position [317]. 

218 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
A direct consequence of Caratheodory's theorem is that any state in D 
can be decomposed into a sum of at most (dim(Hd x dim(H2))2 products of 
pure states. So, for two spin-1/2 particles there are at most 16 terms in the 
expansion of any disentangled state in (6.45). In addition, each pure state 
can be described using two real numbers, so that there are altogether at 
most 15 + 16 x 4 = 79 real parameters needed to completely characterize a 
disentangled state in this case. 
We note that this efficient computer search provides an alternative crite-
rion for deciding when a given state a of two spin-1/2 systems is disentangled, 
i.e. of the form given in (6.45). The already existing criterion is the one given 
by Peres and the Horodecki family. It states that a state is disentangled iff 
its partial trace is a negative operator (see the second and third references 
in [326]). This criterion is only valid for two spin 1/2, or one spin 1/2 and 
one spin 1 systems. In the absence of a more general analytical criterion, our 
computational method provides a way of deciding this question. 
At the end of this section we mention additivity as an important property 
desired from a measure of entanglement, i.e. we would like to have 
(6.49) 
where systems 1 + 2 and systems 3 + 4 are entangled separately from each 
other. The exact definition of the left hand side is 
(6.50) 
Why should we choose this form? One would originally assume that a12 ® a34 
should be minimised by the states of the form (2.::, P,Pl ® p~) ® (2.::J PJP3 ® 
P4J However, Alice and Bob can also perform arbitrary unitary operation 
on their subsystems (i.e. locally). This obviously leads to the creation of 
entanglement between 1 and 2 and between 3 and 4 and hence the form in 
(6.50). Additivity is, of course, already true for the pure states as can be seen 
from the proof above, when our measure reduces to the VOn Neumann entropy. 
For a more general case we have not been able to provide any analytical proof, 
so that the above property remains a conjecture. However, for two spin-1/2 
systems, our program has not found any counter-example. We will therefore 
assume this property to hold. A direct consequence of this and E3 is that the 
relative entropy of entanglement is an upper bound on the efficiency of any 
purification procedure. Namely if we start with n pairs in the state a and 
obtain m singlets as a result of a purification procedure then 
nxE(a)2':mln2, 
(6.51) 
i.e. the efficiency min is always bounded by E(a). Since E(a) can be smaller 
than the entanglement of creation, this implies that the entanglement of 
creation and distillation are not necessarily equal. 

6.4 Entanglement Quantification 
219 
6.4.6 Statistical Basis of Entanglement Measure 
Let us see how we can interpret our entanglement measure in the light of 
experiments, i.e. statistically [327]. We first show how the notion of relative 
entropy arises in classical information theory as a measure of distinguisha-
bility of two probability distributions. We then generalise this idea to the 
quantum case, i.e. to distinguishing between two quantum states (for a dis-
cussion of distinguishability of pure quantum states see e.g. [328]). We will 
see that this naturally leads to the notion of the quantum relative entropy. It 
is then straightforward to extend this concept to explain the relative entropy 
of entanglement. Suppose we would like to check if a given coin is "fair", 
i.e. if it generates a "head-tail" distribution of f = (1/2,1/2). If the coin 
is biased then it will produce some other distribution, say uf = (1/3,2/3). 
So, our question of the coin fairness boils down to how well we can differ-
entiate between two given probability distributions given a finite number, n, 
of experiments to perform on one of the two distributions. In the case of a 
coin we would toss it n times and record the number of O's and l's. What 
is the probability that a fair coin will be mistaken for an unfair one with 
the distribution of (1/3,2/3) given n trials on the fair coin? For large n the 
answer is [327, 329] (Sanov's theorem) 
p(fair ~ unfair) = e-nSc/(ufllfl , 
(6.52) 
where Scl(ufllf) = 1/3In1/3 + 2/3In2/3 - 1/3In1/2 - 2/3In1/2 is the 
classical relative entropy for the two distributions. So, 
(6.53) 
which tends exponentially to zero with n ~ 00. In fact we see that already 
after'" 20 trials the probability of mistaking the two distributions is vanish-
ingly small, ::; 10-10 . 
In quantum theory we therefore state a law analogous to Sanov's theorem 
(see also [327]), 
Theorem. (Quantum Sanov's Theorem). The probability of not distinguish-
ing two quantum states (i.e. density matrices) 0" and p after n measurements 
is 
p(p ~ 
0") = e-nS(ullp) . 
(6.54) 
It can be claimed with certainty that the above presents the lower limit to 
the probability of confusing p with 0" after performing n measurements on p 
[327]. In fact, this bound is reached asymptotically as proved in [330], and 
the measurements achieving this are projectors independent of the state 0" 
[331]. Now the interpretation of the relative entropy of entanglement becomes 
immediately transparent [327]. The probability of mistaking an entangled 
state 0" for a closest, disentangled state, p, is e-nXmtnpEvS(U,P) = e-nE(u). If 

220 
6. Quantum Networks and Multi-Particle Entanglement 
entanglement of a is greater, then it takes fewer measurements to distinguish 
it from a disentangled state (or, fixing n, there is a smaller probability of 
confusing it with some disentangled state). Let us give an example. Consider 
a state (100)+111) )/V2, known to be a maximally entangled state. The closest 
to it is the disentangled state (100) (001+111)(111)/2 [321]. To distinguish these 
states it is enough to perform projections onto (100) + 111) )/V2. If the state 
that we are measuring is the above mixture, then the sequence of results (1 
for a successful projection, and 0 for an unsuccessful projection) will contain 
on average an equal number of O's and 1 'so For this to be mistaken for the 
above pure state the sequence has to contain all n 1 'so The probability for 
that is 2-n , which also comes from using (6.54). If, on the other hand, we 
performed projections onto the pure state itself, we would then never confuse 
it with a mixture, and from (6.54) the probability is seen to be e- oo = O. 
We see that the above treatment does not refer to the number (or in-
deed dimensionality) of the entangled systems. This is a desired property as 
it makes our measure of entanglement universal. The extensions to three or 
more systems are straightforward [322, 327]. (See also Sect. 8.5 on multipar-
ticle entanglement purification). 

7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
7.1 Introduction 
The main obstacle for the experimental implementations of quantum state 
processing is quantum decoherence. In Sect. 7.2 it is shown that decoher-
ence of the state of a quantum system can be viewed as the consequence of 
entanglement between the quantum system and its environment. Section 7.3 
illustrates the seemingly devastating effect of decoherence due to spontaneous 
decay for an ion-trap quantum computer. 
One of the most important achievements in the field of quantum infor-
mation is the discovery of methods to overcome the problem of decoherence. 
These methods are called quantum error correction schemes and are intro-
duced in Sect. 7.4. The methods make use of the fact that the state of a 
single qubit can be encoded on entangled states of several qubits. Symmetry 
properties of these entangled states, together with the fact that quantum 
noise can be digitized by projection measurements, enables the detection and 
correction of quantum errors. Since entangled states are themselves more vul-
nerable to decoherence than single-qubit states, there is a trade-off between 
correcting and inducing quantum errors for such schemes. The general theory 
of quantum error correction and the issue of fault tolerance will be addressed 
in Sect. 7.5. A good illustration of a realistic error correction procedure is 
the problem of creating a frequency standard using Ramsey spectroscopy and 
this is presented in Sect. 7.6. 
Another route to overcome decoherences is to distill from a large set of 
entangled particles, that has been degraded in purity by decoherence, a subset 
of particles with enhanced entanglement purity. Entanglement purification is 
the topic of Chap. 8.

7.2 Decoherence 
A.K. Ekert, C.M. Palma, K.A. Suominen 
7.2.1 Decoherence: Entanglement Between 
Qubits and Environment 
As described in Chap. 4 of this book a quantum computer can be viewed as a 
sort of "programmable interferometer" where different computational paths 
are designed in such a way as to interfere constructively on the desired result. 
In order for such interference to take place the evolution of the computer must 
be coherent, i.e. unitary. Any deviation from unitarity due to decoherence 
would spoil the interference visibility. 
Decoherence appears whenever our qubits are coupled with their environ-
ment. To illustrate the origin of decoherence mechanisms let us assume that 
the qubit--environment coupling induces a joint unitary time evolution of the 
following form 
10)IE) ~ 
10)IEo(t)) 
(7.1) 
where IE) is some fixed initial state of the environment, and U(t) is the joint 
unitary time evolution operator. In (7.1) the environment acts as a measuring 
apparatus which acquires information on the states of our qubit [332]. When 
the initial state of the qubit is a linear superposition of states 10) and 11), 
U(t) will introduce entanglement between qubit and environment: 
(7.2) 
Decoherence is due exactly to such entanglement, since nonunitarity emerges 
once we trace over the environment degrees of freedom. The reduced density 
matrix of the qubit corresponding to state (7.2) is given by 
(7.3) 
In most cases states IEo(t)), IE1(t)) become more orthogonal in time (i.e. 
more and more information on the qubit state leaks into the environment) 
and we can conveniently write 
(7.4) 
where r(t) is a function of time whose specific form will depend on the de-
tails of the coupling between qubit and environment [333]. Its value depends 

7.2 Decoherence 
223 
on the type of qubits and their interaction with the environment and can 
vary from 104 s for nuclear spins in a paramagnetic atom to 10~12 s for 
electron~hole excitations in the bulk of a semiconductor [334]. As a COnse-
quence the particular kin.d of entanglement described by (7.2) kills the off-
diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix ~ the so-called "coherences" 
~ while leaving the diagonal ones, known as "populations" unaffected. This 
effect is known as dephasing. We will describe later the effects of other kind 
of qubit~environment entanglement. From the complexity viewpoint it is im-
portant to know how the characteristic de coherence time scales with the size 
of our quantum computer. To this end let us introduce a model of qubit--
environment coupling which generates a time evolution of the kind described 
in (7.1). We will model our environment as a bath of harmonic oscillators 
[333, 335] and we will assume that the interaction Hamiltonian between a 
single qubit and its environment is of the form 
H = ~o-zwo + L btbkwk + L o-z(9kbt + gkbk) , 
(7.5) 
k 
k 
where Wk, bt, bk are, respectively, the frequency and the creation and annihi-
lation bosonic operators of the k mode of our bath of harmonic oscillators, 
and 0-z is a Pauli pseudospin operator. The first and the second term On the 
r.h.s. of (7.5) describe, respectively, the free evolution of the qubit and of the 
environment, and the third term describes the interaction between the two. 
The state of the combined system (qubit + environment) is described by a 
density operator (1(t) which at time t = 0 is assumed to be 
(1(0) = 11f'!)(1f'!1 ® II 10k) (Ok' I = p(O) ® Ivac) (vacl , 
(7,6) 
k,k' 
where 11f'!) is the initial state of our qubit and Ivac) = ITk 10k ) is the vacuum 
state of all the bath modes. Since [0-z, H] = 0, the populations of the qubit 
density matrix, p(t) = TrR(1(t) are not affected by the environment, which 
in our model simply erodes quantum coherence as anticipated. This model is 
exactly soluble and allows a clear analysis of the mechanism of entanglement 
between qubit and environment which, as we have discussed, is believed to 
be at the core of most de coherence processes. 
It can be easily shown that the time evolution operator U(t) in the inter-
action picture is a conditional displacement operator for the field [333], the 
sign of the displacement being dependent On the logical value of the qubit. 
U(t) will therefore induce a dynamics of the kind described in (7.2) with 
(7,7) 
where the states I¢k) are coherent states of amplitude ¢k = gk(l - eWkt)/wk. 
A detailed calculation of T(t) and an extension of the analysis to the finite 
temperature case can be found in [333, 335]. 

224 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
7.2.2 Collective Interaction and Scaling 
We now have all the ingredients to analyse the decoherence of a register on 
n qubits [333]. The Hamiltonian in this case will read 
H = ~ L O"z"wo + L btbkwk + L O"z(g"kbt + g;,kh) , 
(7.8) 
k 
"k 
where the coupling constants gz,k will now depend on the position of the ith 
qubit. The entanglement induced by this Hamiltonian will be of the form 
where in labels the logical value of the nth qubit. The bath of harmonic os-
cillators will be characterized by a coherence length Ac over which its fluctua-
tions are correlated. The form of states IE" ... ,J can be instructively obtained 
in two limiting cases of physical relevance, depending on the ratio between 
the physical size of our register and Ac. 
Short Ac: In this case each qubit will feel its own independent environment 
and will decohere individually. We will have 
(7.10) 
where the IEzJ are the same as in (7.7) and the density operator matrix 
elements will decay as 
The fastest decay will occur for 
Pll ... l,OO ... O(t) = Pll"'1,OO ... o(O)(E1IEo)n = PU. .. l,OO ... o(O)e-nr(t). 
(7.12) 
Long Ac: When Ac is sufficiently long we can assume that all the qubits 
collectively interact with the same environment, i.e. we can assume g"k = 
gk for all qubits. U(t) will then be a conditional displacement operator of 
amplitude depending on the logical value of all qubits in our register. More 
explicitly 
IE" . ,J = II 1- {(-I)" + (-1)'2 ... (-l)'n }<Pk)' 
(7.13) 
k 
The fastest decay will occur for 
Pll .. l,OO ... o(t) = Pll ... l,OO.O(O)(Ell ... 1IEoo ... o) = Pll ... l,OO ... o(O)e-n2r(t). 
(7.14) 

7.2 Decoherence 
225 
The physical origin of the n 2 in the exponent can be easily understood by 
noting that IEoo ... o), lEn. .1) are the tensor product on coherent states of 
amplitude n(/Jk. 
The above discussion shows how the decay of coherences of a register 
of n qubits scales as exp[-Poly(nh(t)] , with Poly{n}", n for independent 
interaction with the environment and Poly{n}", n 2 for collective interaction. 
7.2.3 Subspace Decoupled From Environment 
If collective interactions lead to faster decay rates it should be noted that it 
also leads to the appearance of subspaces decoupled from the environment. 
As (7.13) clearly shows, states with an equal number of ° and 1 do not get 
entangled with the environment and therefore are not prone to decoherence. 
In other words the interaction does not displace the amplitude of the field 
modes. This suggests the possibility of using this decoupled subspace to im-
plement a simple form of redundant coding. Let us suppose that we can 
manufacture in our laboratory a quantum register of 2L qubits composed of 
pairs of qubits close enough to each other so that each pair is effectively in-
teracting with the same reservoir. Different pairs can interact with different 
reservoirs, although the results we are going to illustrate are not modified 
if all the qubits interact with the same reservoir. We could then encode the 
logical states as follows 
10; = 10, I;, 
Ii) = 11,0;. 
(7.15) 
The idea is that if we use a pair of qubits to encode a bit we might effectively 
decouple the register from the environment. 
Several problems remain open with this kind of coding. First of all we 
should make sure that such states are also robust also with respect to other 
channels of decoherence (we will come to this question in the next section). 
Secondly the problem remains of how to prepare such states (states which 
are decoupled from the environment are often also decoupled from external 
probes) and how to read them (this will imply collective measurements). 
Finally, it is not yet clear how to perform quantum computation confined 
within such subsystems. Qubit--qubit controllable interactions might turn 
out to be useful tools for implementing gate operation [336, 337]. 
7.2.4 Other Find of Couplings 
In the remainder of this section we would like to discuss which of the re-
sults obtained survives once we take into account more realistic mechanisms 
for qubit~environment interaction. The model we will briefly analyse is one 
commonly used to describe a broad range of physical phenomena, like the 
exchange of photons between the electromagnetic field and a two-level atom 

226 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
in quantum optics [338]. In this model the Hamiltonian of a system of n 
identical qubits coupled with the reservoir of harmonic oscillators will be 
H = ~ L 
O"z,tWO + L 
btbkwk + L(gt,kO"-,tbt + g:,kO"+,tbk) ' 
(7.16) 
k 
t,k 
where O"_,t and O"+,t are the lowering and raising operators for qubit i. 
The dynamics generated by (7.16) cannot be solved exactly. However, 
under the so called Born-Markov approximation, the time evolution of the 
qubit reduced density operator can be described by a master equation [338, 
339]. If the spacing between the qubits is smaller than the wavelength of the 
resonant modes it reasonable to assume gt,k cv go, and the desired master 
equation will be: 
(7.17) 
where we have introduced the collective operators Sz = Lt O"z,t, S± = 
L±t O"± and the decay constant "( ex: Igol25(wk - wo). 
The dynamics described by (7.17) is clearly nonunitary. The nonunitarity 
is again due to entanglement between qubit and environment, although this 
is less evident than in the exactly soluble model analysed in the previous 
section. 
In the case of dissipation of a single qubit the reduced density at time t 
will be 
(7.18) 
which shows clearly that this model of coupling induces decoherence and 
decay of the populations. 
In order to illustrate the characteristics of collective interaction in this 
new scenario it is instructive to discuss the decay of the entangled Bell states 
ItJf±) = 
~{101) ± 110)} . The probability amplitude for the decay into state 
100) is proportional to the matrix element of operator S+ 
(7.19) 
This shows clearly how the probability amplitudes for the decay of the 
ItJf +) state interfere constructively leading to a decay rate twice the decay 
rate of a single qubit while they interfere destructively for the ItJf _) state. For 
a large number n on qubits the collective decay will lead to decay constants 
scaling from n"( to n 2"(, while the singlet collective state will be decoupled 
from the environment. This is the well known phenomenon of superradiance 
vs. sub radiance [339, 340]. Again this suggests the possibility of using the 

7.3 Limits to Quantum Computation Due to Decoherence 
227 
subradiant subspaces of a register of n qubits [341]. Of course also in this 
case all the difficulties we have mentioned in the previous section remain. 
To conclude, we would like to point out that, although different models 
will lead to different physical decay mechanisms and will need different tech-
niques for their treatment, many of the qualitative features of decoherence 
processes do not depend on the specific model of coupling. In particular all 
decoherence processes will lead to a nonunitary time evolution of the quan-
tum register. Furthermore collective interaction will enhance the decay of 
some register subspaces and will inhibit the decay of other. Therefore our 
considerations on the scaling of the decoherence time with the size of our 
quantum computer and on collective encoding remain valid regardless of the 
details of the coupling with the environment. 
7.3 Limits to Quantum Computation 
Due to Decoherence 
M.B. Plenio, P.L. Knight 
The previous section presented models to describe decoherence and dissipa-
tion of an array of qubits, implemented e.g. on a string of ions (see Chap. 5). 
After these general considerations we will now estimate how serious the im-
pact of noise will be on a quantum computer. In particular we would like to 
see how many quantum operations we can possibly perform for example with 
an ion trap quantum computer of which the principles have been described 
in Sect. 4.3 and Chap. 5 [156]. We will not discuss here many of the other 
potential implementations of a quantum computer such as nuclear magnetic 
resonance schemes [342, 343] (see also Sect. 5.4). 
There are many possible mechanisms that produce noise in a quantum 
computer. In this subsection we will discuss only the effect of spontaneous 
emission from the ions [344]-[347] because the analysis is quite instructive. 
Other mechanisms such as noise in the centre-of-mass mode [348], laser in-
stabilities and cross-talking between different ions due to their small spatial 
separation [349] will not be discussed here. For these effects we refer the 
reader to the cited literature. 
Now we want to estimate the effect of spontaneous emission on a quantum 
computer. To do this we use as a benchmark the algorithm for the factorisa-
tion of large numbers [350]. The discussion can easily be generalised to other 
algorithms. As was shown in Sect. 4.2, finding factors of a large number on 
a classical computer is a hard problem and cannot be done efficiently. On 
a quantum computer, however, an efficient algorithm has been found. Un-
der ideal conditions this algorithm would allow a quantum computer to find 
factors of a large number exponentially faster than on a classical computer. 

228 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
We will now discuss what the largest number is that one can factorise on a 
quantum computer if we assume that the only source of error is spontaneous 
emission from ions. To simplify the analysis, we do not consider the possibil-
ity of quantum error correction here but refer the reader to literature [346] 
and to the next section of this chapter. 
Consider the following experimental setup: A string of ions is placed in a 
linear ion trap and cooled to the motional ground state. Each qubit is repre-
sented by a metastable optical transition in the ion. The internal structure 
of the ions we are considering is shown in Fig. 7.1). The qubit is represented 
by the atomic levels 0 and 1. Transitions are driven by a laser with Rabi 
frequency no. and spontaneous emissions from level i can occur at a rate 
2rt<. The existence of the additional level 2 is important and will be dis-
cussed later. Of course more sophisticated methods for the representation of 
the qubit are possible, e.g. in Zeeman sub-levels, but the analysis becomes 
more complicated while the conclusions are similar. Therefore we refer the 
reader to the literature [346]. 
Our aim is the factorisation of an L-bit number, which means a number 
which is not larger than 2L. From Shors' algorithm [350], we know that this 
task can be performed using fL3 elementary operations such as one-bit gates, 
CNOT gates and Toffoli gates. Networks that perform this task have been 
designed [351] and it turns out that the algorithm requires of order 5L qubits 
to factorise an L bit number. 
How long does it take to perform all the necessary gates? It takes 1.5 
times as long to implement a Toffoli gate than it takes to make a CNOT 
gate [156]. Therefore it is enough to calculate the time required to perform 
a CNOT gate. Single bit gates will not be considered because they can be 
implemented much faster. The reason is that, unlike for a CNOT gate, the 
implementation of a single bit gate does not require an excitation of the 
centre-of-mass mode (see Sect. 5.2.9). 
The implementation of a CNOT gate requires 
v'5L 
Tel = 47f--n- . 
"lHOl 
(7.20) 
Here 5L is the number of ions in the trap, nOl is the Rabi frequency of the 
laser that drives the qubit transition and "l is the Lamb-Dicke parameter 
(see Chap. 5 for experimental details). Therefore the total time required to 
perform the factorisation of an L bit number is the number of required CNOT 
gates multiplied by Tel. We find 
(7.21 ) 
Obviously there are free parameters in this expression. In particular we could 
imagine that we could increase the Rabi frequency as much as we like to 
permit a very rapid calculation. This would allow us to avoid spontaneous

o ++ 1 transition represents the qubit. It is driven by a laser of Rabi frequency 
nOl. Level 1 has a spontaneous decay rate 2rl1 which is assumed to be small. The 
laser which is resonant with the 0 ++ 1 transition inevitably couples level 0 also to 
other non-resonant levels such as level 2. The Rabi frequency on that transition is 
then n02 and the decay rate 2n2 is usually much larger than 2rl1 . The effective

emission from the upper level of the qubit. However, this is not so easy. The 
reason for this is the fact that the Rabi frequency of a transition and the 
decay constant of that transition are related to each other by

is the permittivity of free space, and WOl the transition frequency. Still one 
could imagine increasing the electric field strength of the laser E arbitrarily. 
Obviously there are some upper limits to that process. If E is so strong 
that it exceeds the electric field between the electron and the nucleus then 
the ion will ionize immediately. This limit, however, is quite high and other 
effects are more relevant. In fact at high field strengths of the laser we cannot 
continue to assume that the ion has only two relevant energy levels. Other 
energy levels will contribute to the dynamics, as they might obtain some 
small population due to off-resonant transitions to them. This situation is 
presented in Fig. 7.1. In addition to the qubit levels 0 and 1 there are other, 
far detuned levels around. We summarise the effect of all existing auxiliary 
levels by assuming one additional energy level 2 that couples to the lower 
qubit state O. Because the laser is far detuned from the 0 ++ 2 transition 
the population in the upper level will be small. Nevertheless, spontaneous 
emission from that level may take place, especially because this auxiliary level 

230 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
could well have a very short lifetime. The stronger the electric field of the 
applied laser, the larger the population in this auxiliary level. Therefore we 
have a trade-off between spontaneous emission from the upper qubit level and 
spontaneous emission from the auxiliary level. The faster the computation, 
the lower the spontaneous emissions from the upper qubit state 1 but the 
greater the spontaneous emissions from the auxiliary level. 
In the following we calculate the probability Ptot of an emission from either 
level 1 or level 2. The aim is to minimise this probability. This minimisation 
then leads to an intensity-independent limit to the size of the number that 
can be factorised by a quantum computer in the presence of spontaneous 
emission. 
During all the quantum computation, on average half of the qubits are in 
the upper state. Therefore the probability of a spontaneous emission occur-
ring from the upper level during the whole computation is given by 
1 
Pl = "22r1l5LT. 
(7.23) 
On the other hand, the auxiliary level is populated only during the interaction 
of the ion with the laser. Therefore the probability of suffering a spontaneous 
emission from an auxiliary level is given by 
il52 
P2 = ~2r22T.

7.3 Limits to Quantum Computation Due to Decoherence 
231 
Longer qubit lifetime required 
Fig. 7.2. The strong L dependence in (7.30) is due to a positive feedback. If we 
try to increase L our computation becomes longer. That requires a longer lifetime 
of the qubit which reduces the achievable Rabi frequency on the qubit transition. 
This lengthens the computation even more. 
To ensure that with a high probability there is no spontaneous emISSIOn 
during the quantum computation, we require Pmm « 1. We can therefore 
transform (7.29) into an upper bound on £ which is given by 
(7.30) 
The reader might wonder where the power of £8 in (7.30) originates from. 
The reason is a positive control loop as shown in Fig. 7.2. 
To see whether this is a serious limitation we need to plug some numbers 
into the equation. We will use values for realistic ions, i.e. ions that are being 
used in ion trap experiments. 
In Table 7.1 (which is taken from [346]) we can see the results for some real 
atoms. The resulting limits for the factorisable numbers are really small. This 
Table 7.1. For several possible systems the upper limit on the bitsize L of the 
number N that can be factorised on a quantum computer is calculated. A qubit is 
stored in a metastable optical transition. The atomic levels which are abbreviated 
in Fig. 7.1 by 0, 1 and 2 are given. The atomic data are inserted into (7.30) and the 
result is given in the last row of the table.

shows that even noise from spontaneous emission places serious limitations 
on quantum computation. This is the reason why scientists in this field have 
been highly motivated to develop methods that are able to correct the errors 
generated by noise such as spontaneous emission. These methods will be 
presented in the next section and in fact they can improve the limitations 
that we have derived in this chapter. 
7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
C. Macchiavello, C.M. Palma 
7.4.1 Symmetrisation Procedures 
The first proposed remedy for quantum noise in quantum computation was 
based on a symmetrisation procedure [352J. We briefly summarise here the 
basic idea. Suppose you have a quantum system, you prepare it in some initial 
state 1 tJi.) and you want to implement a prescribed unitary evolution 1 tJi(t)) 
or you simply want to preserve 1 tJi.) for some period of time t. Now, suppose 
that instead of a single system you can prepare R copies of 1 tJi.) and subse-
quently you can project the state of the combined system onto the symmetric 
subspace i.e. the subspace containing all states which are invariant under any 
permutation of the sub-systems. The claim is that frequent projections on 
the symmetric subspace will reduce errors induced by the environment. The 
intuition behind this concept is based on the observation that a prescribed 
error-free storage or evolution of the R independent copies starts in the sym-
metric sub-space and should remain in that sub-space. Therefore, since the 
error-free component of any state always lies in the symmetric subspace, upon 
successful projection it will be unchanged and part of the error will have been 
removed. Note, however, that the projected state is generally not error-free 
since the symmetric subspace contains states which are not of the simple 
product form 1 'IjJ) 1 'IjJ)···1 'IjJ). Nevertheless it has been shown that the error 
probability will be suppressed by a factor of 1/ R [353J. 
We illustrate here this effect in the simplest case of two qubits. The pro-
jection into the symmetric subspace is performed in this case by introducing 
the symmetrisation operator 
(7.31) 
where P12 represents the identity and P21 the permutation operator which 
exchanges the states of the two qubits. The symmetric projection of a pure 
state 1 tJi) of two qubits is just S 1 tJi), which is then renormalised to unity. 

7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
233 
It follows that the induced map on mixed states of two qubits (including 
renormalisation) is 
(7.32) 
The state of either qubit separately is then obtained by the partial trace over 
the other qubit. 
Let us assume that the two copies are initially prepared in a pure state 
Po = I tJi) (tJi I and that they interact with independent environments. Af-
ter some short period of time M the state of the two copies p(2) will have 
undergone an evolution 
p(2) (0) = Po 181 Po 
(7.33) 
where P. = Po + (2. for some Hermitian traceless e •. We will retain only terms 
of first order in the perturbations e. so that the overall state at time M is 
(7.34) 
We can calculate the average purity of the two copies before symmetrisa-
tion by calculating the average trace of the squared states: 
1 2 
"2 L Tr( (Po + e.)2) = 1 + 2Tr(PoQ), 
(7.35) 
.=1 
where Q = ~(e1 + (2). Note that Tr(PoQ) is negative, so that the expression 
above does not exceed 1. After symmetrisation each qubit is in state 
Ps = [1 - Tr(poQ)]po + ~Q + ~(POQ + QPo) 
(7.36) 
and has purity 
(7.37) 
Since Trp; is closer to 1 than (7.35), the resulting symmetrised system Ps is 
left in a purer state. 
Let us now see how the fidelity changes by applying the symmetrisation 
procedure. The average fidelity before symmetrisation is 
1 ""' 
_ 
Pbs = "2 L.., (tJi I Po + e. I tJi) = 1 + (tJi I e I tJi) , 
(7.38) 
while after successful symmetrisation it takes the form 
(7.39) 

234 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
The state after symmetrisation is therefore closer to the initial state PO. 
For the generic case of R copies the purity of each qubit after symmetri-
sation is given by [353] 
(7.40) 
where now fJ = -ft E!I rh, and the fidelity takes the form 
1 
_ 
(tJi I Ps I tJi) = 1 + :RTr(POQ) . 
(7.41) 
Formulae (7.40) and (7.41) must be compared with the corresponding ones 
before symmetrisation, i.e. (7.35) and (7.38). As we can see, Ps approaches the 
unperturbed state Po as R tends to infinity. Thus by choosing R sufficiently 
large and the rate of symmetric projection sufficiently high, the residual error 
at the end of a computation can, in principle, be controlled to lie within any 
desired small tolerance. 
7.4.2 Classical Error Correction 
A different class of error correcting techniques originates from an extension 
to the quantum realm of existing classical error correcting codes [354]. Indeed 
the problem of how to transmit and manipulate information reliably when 
errors can be induced by noise is present also in classical information theory. 
Before we begin our analysis of quantum error correcting codes it is there-
fore appropriate to briefly review how error correction is implemented in a 
classical scenario. In what follows a code will be a set of c binary sequences 
WI ... W c, called codewords, of length n. During transmission or storage, some 
bits, due to the action of external noise, can undergo random flips. Bit flips 
are the only possible kind of classical error. If the channel is a binary symmet-
ric memoryless channel (see Fig. 7.3) the set of possible received sequences 
VI ... V2n is the set of all the 2n binary sequences of length n. The task of the 
receiver is, given a received sequence Vo, to identify the most likely codeword 
w, sent by the transmitter, i.e. to identify the w, closest to Vo. In this context 
the distance between two binary sequences d( w, v), the so called Hamming 
distance, is measured by the number of digits in which the two strings differ. 
For a binary symmetric memoryless channel the w, with smallest Hamming 
distance d(w" vo) is also the most likely. 
Clearly the larger the distance between codewords the better they are 
distinguishable in the presence of errors and therefore the more the code is 
robust against noise. If d(w" w J ) ~ 27] + 1 for i i- j then up to 7] errors can 
be corrected. 
The Hamming bound provides an upper bound to the number of code-
words c in a code able to correct up to 7] errors. Each codeword w, is the centre 
of a sphere of radius 7] containing all binary sequences v with d(wi, v) :S 'f}, 

7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
235 
Fig. 7.3. In a binary symmetric channel each bit is transmitted with an error 
probability E. 
i.e. differing from W t in up to T/ locations. Figure 7.4 is an illustration of this 
situation for T/ = 4. If the code can correct the errors, these spheres must be 
disjoint. Obviously the number of sequences in each sphere times the number 
of spheres must be smaller than the total number of sequences of length n. 
Since each sphere contains a codeword W plus all the sequences differing from 
it in 1,2,··· T/ positions we must have 
(7.42) 
A family of codes which has proved very efficient is known for historical 
reasons as parity check codes [354]. In these codes the codewords ware 
chosen in such a way as to satisfy a set of linear equations. The receiver tests 
whether the received sequence v satisfies this set of linear relations. If v fails 
the test the receiver corrects the smallest error which might have produced 
v. Let's see in more detail how the code works. The set of linear equations 
the codewords must satisfy is characterized by a parity check matrix M . 
Codewords ware chosen to satisfy the relation 
M·w=O. 
(7.43) 
For example codewords 
WI = 0000 
W3 = 1110 
W4 = 1011 
(7.44) 
Fig. 7.4. In codes with d(w" w J ) 2 2T} + 1 disjoint spheres of radius T} centred on 
each codeword contain all the sequences with up to T} errors. 

236 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
satisfy (7.43), with 
M=(1010) 
011 1 
(7.45) 
where all the arithmetic is modulo 2. If the rank of M is m than k = n -
m bits of our codeword can be specified arbitrarily while the remaining m 
digits are check digits determined by relation (7.43). The number of linearly 
independent codewords is therefore c = 2n - m = 2k and the Hamming bound 
(7.42) can be rewritten as 
(7.46) 
which is a lower bound for the number of check digits. Suppose that the 
sequence w is transmitted and that the sequence v is received. The sequence 
z = w - v, known as the error pattern, is a binary sequence with ones in the 
positions where an error has occurred and zeros elsewhere. If z i:- 0 than v 
fails the parity check: M· v = M· (w + z) = M· z = s. The vector s, known 
as error syndrome, is the sum of the columns of the parity check matrix in 
the location where z has ones. For example if w = 1110 is transmitted and 
v = 1000 is received then z = 0110 and, with M as given by (7.45), s = 10. 
The task of the receiver, once an error syndrome s is detected, is to identify 
the error patterns z which might have produced s and to correct the smallest 
one, i.e. the one with the smallest number of l's. It should be noted that if 
our code can correct a single error the syndrome is simply the column where 
the error has occurred. If the columns of M are different the receiver can 
easily identify the location of the error and correct it. 
7.4.3 General Aspects of Quantum Error Correcting Codes 
As soon as we try to extend the error correcting techniques illustrated above 
to the quantum scenario we immediately face two problems: 
1. Due to external noise each qubit may not only flip its logical value but 
also decohere. In general it will get entangled with the environment, as 
was shown in Sect. 7.2. 
2. We are not allowed to read the state of the qubit before the end of 
the computation. Failure to observe this rule leads to decoherence. We 
must therefore acquire knowledge on the location and nature of the error 
without acquiring knowledge on the state of the qubits. 
We will show that the way out problem 2 is to use as "codevectors" Iw} 
entangled states of n qubits. The information we want to protect is therefore 
spread by the entanglement over all the n qubits. Reading (or decohering) 
only a few qubits will not lead to an irreversible loss of quantum information. 

7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
237 
Codevectors are chosen in such a way that an error will move the Iw) into 
mutually orthogonal subspaces. Measurement of the syndrome will therefore 
reveal only which subspace Iw) has moved to. In what follows we will assume 
that each qubit can undergo an error with probability E and that errors on 
different qubits are independent. With these assumptions the probability of 
errors on two qubits is of order O(E2). For sufficiently small values of Ewe 
can reasonably assume that only one error has occurred. The probability 
of successful computation is (1 - E). If we can implement a quantum error 
correction routine able to correct single errors the probability of success can 
be increased to (1 - O(E2)). In general a code able to correct up to terrors 
increases the probability of successful computation to (1 - O(Et+l )). 
7.4.4 The Three Qubit Code 
To gain some familiarity with quantum error correcting codes and to illustrate 
the ideas sketched above we will start by analyzing the three qubit code which 
can correct phase errors on a single qubit [355]. Suppose that each qubit of 
the qubit of a codeword can independently undergo an entanglement with 
the environment of the form (7.1). We will show that we can undo the effects 
of phase entanglement if we can correct phase errors, defined as 
11) ----+ -11) 
(7.4 7) 
due to the error operator u z. To this goal let us choose as codewords the 
following entangled states of three qubits: 
Iwo) = 1000) + 1011) + 1101) + 1110), 
IWl) = 1111) + 1100) + 1010) + 1001). 
(7.48) 
If only one qubit gets entangled with the environment, an arbitrary linear 
superposition of Iwo), IWl) will become 
(aulwo) + allwl))IE) ----+ (aolwo)o + allwl)o)IEo) 
+ (aolwoh + allwlh)IE1) 
+ (aolwo)2 + allwl)2)IE2) 
+ (aolwo)3 + allwl)3)I E3), 
(7.49) 
where the error state IWJh is codeword j, (j = 0,1) with a phase error on 
his kth qubit (k = ° labels no error). For example IWO)2 = 1000) - 1011) + 
1101) - 1110). The IEk ) are the corresponding environment states. Note that 
the error states are orthogonal: 
(7.50) 
Codes in which error states are orthogonal are called non-degenerate. The 
error correction procedure is therefore the following: 

238 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
• Project the code space onto the error subspaces spanned by Iwo).lwl). 
• Depending on the outcome of the measurement correct the appropriate 
qubit with a phase error applying a z. More explicitly, if the result of the 
above projection measurement is i, apply az to the ith qubit (when i = 0 
the state is not modified). 
Note that at the end of the procedure the codevector and the environment 
are disentangled and that the amplitudes ao, al are not modified. 
7.4.5 The Quantum Hamming Bound 
We can now turn our attention to codes able to correct the most general kind 
of qubit--environment entanglement, which is of the form 
11)IE) ---+ 10)IE1O ) + 11)IE11). 
(7.51) 
For a linear superposition of qubit states this can be conveniently written as 
(aoIO) +alI1))IE) ---+ ( aolO) +alI1) )IEo) 
+ [ax(aoI1) +alIO))]IEx) 
+ [az(aoIO) - alI1))]IEz) 
+ [ay(aoI1) - alIO))]IEy) , 
(7.52) 
where ax is the error operator for bit flips, az the error operator for phase flips 
defined in the previous paragraph and ay = -iazax is the operator for both 
errors. As we can see from (7.52), a general qubit-environment interaction 
can be expressed as a superposition of unity and Pauli operators ax, ay 
and a z acting on the qubit. This means that the qubit state evolves into a 
superposition of an error-free component and three erroneous components, 
with errors of the ax, ay and az type. 
We can now easily translate into the quantum language the arguments 
which led us to the Hamming bound for "non-degenerate codes" [355] (less 
restrictive conditions hold for general quantum codes, see for example [323]). 
If a code with 2q codevectors can correct up to 'T} errors the codesvectors Iw) 
and all the states which can be obtained from the Iw) with the action of up 
to 'T} error operators must form a set of orthogonal states. The interaction 
with the entanglement will evolve each codevector as 
where indices i, j, ... label the qubits of the codevectors and the k" kJ' ... = 
x, y, z label the error on the corresponding qubit. If the code corrects up to 

7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
239 
Tf errors, all the states with up to TJ errors which originate for each of the 2q 
codevectors must be orthogonal. The number of orthogonal states must be 
smaller than the dimension of the Hilbert. space of n qubits, and we have 
(7.54) 
which puts a lower bound on the number of check qubits n - q of a quantum 
error correcting code able to correct up to Tf errors. The factor 3' in (7.54) 
comes from the fact that in the quantum case three independent errors can 
occur for each qubit, at variance with the classical case, where the only kind 
of possible errors are bit flips. 
7.4.6 The Seven Qubit Code 
We are now ready to illustrate a quantum code which can correct any general 
error on a single qubit. Although five qubit codes exist [323, 356] with this 
property, as predicted by the quantum Hamming bound, for pedagogical 
reasons we will describe the seven qubit code introduced by Steane [357, 358]. 
First of all let us introduce the following parity check matrix: 
( 0001111) 
M= 
0110011 
. 
1010101 
(7.55) 
As all the columns of M are different, if only one bit flip occurs the measure-
ment of the syndrome will reveal the position of the qubit in error. We will 
use as starting ingredients to build the codevectors the (classical) sequences u 
which sat.isfy the parity check Mu = 0 and the corresponding states of seven 
qubits lu) such that the logical value of the qubits corresponds to sequence 
u. The codevectors Iwo) , IWI) are then defined as entangled superposition of 
states lu) with an even and an odd number of l's, respectively: 
(7.56) 
The final ingredient is a procedure to measure the syndrome. To this goal 
let us add three ancillary qubits, one for each bit of the syndrome, i.e. one for 
each row of M (see Fig. 7.5). When matrix element M',J = 1 than a CNOT 
gate is introduced, whose target is the ancillary qubit. i and whose control is 
qubit j of the codevector. 
If the initial codevector is Iv) and the initial vector of the ancillary qubits 
is 10) then the final vector of the ancillary qubits, the ancilla, will be Is) 
IMv) corresponding to the value of the syndrome: 
(7.57)

Fig. 7.5. Measurement of the bit-flip syndrome in the seven qubit code. 
If only one error has occurred, a measurement of the ancilla will project 
the codevector either in the correct state or in a state with one bit flip. 
Furthermore the logical value of the ancilla will reveal the location of the 
qubit in error, which can then be corrected by applying operator ax. 
The technique described above can easily be extended to correct also 
phase flips once we note that phase flips in base 10),11) become bit flips in 
the Hadamard rotated basis. The problem therefore reduces to the correction 
of bit flips in the rotated basis. If we apply bitwise the Hadamard rotation 
each qubit will transform as 
and the codevectors as 
(7.58) 
IWI) ----+ IWI) == ~(Iwo) + IWI))' 
(7.59) 
Note that Iwo), IWI) satisfy the parity check. The procedure to correct 
phase errors is therefore the following: Apply a bitwise Hadamard rotation 
to the codevectors, correct the bit flips in the rotated basis, and rotate back 
to return to the original basis 10),11) (see Fig. 7.6). The phase error will au-
tomatically be corrected. This shows that the seven qubit code can therefore 
correct any arbitrary phase and/or amplitude error in a single qubit.

7.4 Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Computation 
241 
7.4.7 Fault-Tolerant Computation 
So far, computational steps have been assumed to be error-free. In practice 
gate operations are themselves prone to errors. Furthermore, coding, decoding 
and error correction are also computational operations. The problem then 
arises of how to implement reliable computation using faulty circuits. We will 
illustrate in the remainder of this section the basic ideas behind fault-tolerant 
quantum computation [359]. As an example of how faulty gate operation can 
infect the quantum data beyond the recovery ability of our quantum error 
correcting codes, consider the measurement of the syndrome with the help 
of an ancillary qubit. The ancillary qubit is the target of several CNOT 
gates. Since, in a quantum CNOT, phase errors in the target act back on the 
control qubit, any phase error in the ancillary qubit can propagate to more 
than one data qubit. Note, however, that our code can correct only one error. 
Therefore, if the ancillary qubit contaminates two data qubits corruption is 
beyond recovery. 
A way to confine the spreading of infection is to use separate ancillary 
qubits as targets of separate data qubits. The syndrome bit will then be 
inferred from a collective measurement of the ancillary qubits. Care must be 
taken however to make sure that such a procedure will give us information 
only on the errors and not on the state of the data qubits. The solution to 
this problem has been found by Shor. In his scheme the ancillary qubits are 
prepared in a linear superposition of states with an even number of l's: 
IShar) = L Ix) 
(7.60) 
even 
For instance the ancillary qubits - four for each syndrome bit - are prepared 
in state 
1 
IShar) = y8 ( 10000) + 10011) + 10101) + 11001) + 10110) 
+ 11010) + 11100; + 11111; ) . 
(7.61 ) 
Each ancillary qubit will be the target of a different data qubit. At the end 
the value of the syndrome bit is inferred by measuring the parity of the bits 
in the ancillary state. This procedure ensures that measurement of the ancilla 
provides us with information only on the errors. Furthermore it guarantees 
that errors in the ancillary qubits will not spread in the data. 
Our ambition, however, is not only to store data but also to perform 
computations on them. The easiest thing to do would be to decode the data, 
perform the desired computation and then to encode again. While decoded, 
however, data are vulnerable to external noise. Therefore, in order to protect 
our qubits we would like to perform computation directly on codevectors. 
Furthermore we would like to perform this computation in a fault-tolerant 
way in order to avoid propagation of errors. This is automatically achieved

whenever we can construct gate operations on codevectors as bitwise op-
erations on the single encoded qubits. We have shown in (7.58) that this 
is possible for the Hadamard rotation. It is also possible to implement the 
CNOT gate on codevectors pairwise on the code qubits of the control and 
target codevectors. These two gates alone, however, do not constitute a uni-
versal set. They can however be supplemented with a fault-tolerant version 
of the Toffoli gate in order to form such a universal set. 
7.5 General Theory of Quantum Error Correction 
and Fault Tolerance 
A. Steane 
Introductory material and examples of quantum error correction (QEC) 
methods were given in the previous section. Here we will give a summary 
of the simplest aspects of the more general theory. 
QEC is based on three central ideas: digitisation of noise, the manipula-
tion of error operators and syndromes, and quantum error correcting code 
(QECC) construction. The degree of success of QEC relies on the physics of 
noise; we will turn to this after discussing the three central ideas. 
7.5.1 Digitisation of Noise 
"Digitisation of noise" is based on the observation that any interaction be-
tween a set of qubits and another system (such as the environment) can be 
expressed by a generalisation of (7.52): 
(7.62) 
where each "error operator" E, is a tensor product of Pauli operators acting 
on the qubits, I ¢) is the initial state of the qubits, and I'l/J)e are states of

the environment, not necessarily orthogonal or normalised. We thus express 
general noise and/or decoherence in terms of Pauli operators ax, a y, a z acting 
on the qubits. These will be written X == ax, Z == az, Y == -iay = XZ. 
To write tensor products of Pauli matrices acting on n qubits, we intro-
duce the notation XuZv where u and v are n-bit binary vectors. The non-zero 
coordinates of u and v indicate where X and Z operators appear in the prod-
uct. For example, 
X @ I @ Z @ Y @ X == XlOOllZOOllO. 
(7.63) 
Error correction is a process which takes a state such as E, I ¢) to I ¢). 
Correction of X errors takes XuZv I ¢) to Zv I ¢); correction of Z errors takes 
XuZv I ¢) to Xv I ¢). Putting all this together, we discover the highly signifi-
cant fact that to correct the most general posszble noise (7.62), it is sufficient 
to correct just X and Z errors. 
7.5.2 Error Operators, Stabiliser, and Syndrome Extraction 
We will now examine the mathematics of error operators and syndromes, us-
ing the insightful approach put forward by Gottesman [360] and Calderbank 
et. al. [361, 362], building on the first discoveries of Steane [357, 358] and 
Calderbank and Shor [363, 364]. 
Consider the set {I, X, Y, Z} consisting of the identity plus the three Pauli 
operators. The Pauli operators all square to I: X 2 = y2 = Z2 = I, and have 
eigenvalues ±l. Two members of the set only ever commute (XI = IX) or 
anticommute: XZ = -ZX. Tensor products of Pauli operators, i.e. error 
operators, also square to one and either commute or anticommute. N.B. the 
term 'error operator' is here just a shorthand for 'product of Pauli operators'; 
such an operator will sometimes play the role of an error, sometimes of a 
parity check, c.£. classical coding theory, Sect. 7.4.2. 
If there are n qubits in the quantum system, then error operators will be 
of length n. The weight of an error operator is the number of terms not equal 
to I. For example XlOOllZOOllO has length 5, weight 4. 
Let 11. = {M} be a set of commuting error operators. Since the operators 
all commute, they can have simultaneous eigenstates. Let C = {I u)} be the 
orthonormal set of simultaneous eigenstates all having eigenvalue + 1: 
M I u) = I u) V' I u) E C, V'M E 11.. 
(7.64) 
The set C is a quantum error correcting code, and 11. is its stabzlzser. The 
orthonormal states I u) are termed code vectors or quantum codewords. In 
what follows, we will restrict attention to the case in which 11. is a group. Its 
size is 2n - k , and it is spanned by n - k linearly independent members of 11.. 
In this case C has 2k members, so it encodes k qubits, since its members span 
a 2k dimensional subspace of the 2n -dimensional Hilbert space of the whole 

244

system. A general state in this subspace, called an encoded state or logical 
state, can be expressed as a superposition of the code vectors: 
II/» L = L au I u) . 
(7.65) 
IU)EC 
Naturally, a given QECC does not allow correction of all possible errors. 
Each code allows correction of a particular set S = {E} of correctable errors. 
The task of code construction consists of finding codes whose correctable set 
includes the errors most likely to occur in a given physical situation. We will 
turn to this important topic in the next section. First, let us show how the 
correctable set is related to the stabiliser, and demonstrate how the error 
correction is actually achieved. 
First, error operators in the stabiliser are all correctable, E E S VEE 1l, 
since these operators actually have no effect on a general logical state (7.65). 
If these error operators are themselves the only terms in the noise of the 
system under consideration, then the QECC is a noise-free subspace, also 
called decoherence-free subspace of the system. 
There is a large set of further errors which do change encoded states but 
are nevertheless correctable by a process of extracting an error syndrome, 
and then acting on the system depending on what syndrome is obtained. We 
will show that S can be any set of errors {E.} such that every product ElE2 
of two members is either in 1l, or anticommutes with a member of 1l. To see 
this, take the second case first: 
(7.66) 
We say that the combined error operator ElE2 is detectable. This can only 
happen if 
either 
{MEl = -ElM, ME2 = E2M} 
or 
{MEl = ElM, ME2 = -E2M}. 
(7.67) 
To extract the syndrome we measure all the observables in the stabiliser. To 
do this, it is sufficient to measure any set of n - k linearly independent M 
in 1l. Note that such a measurement has no effect on a state in the encoded 
subspace, since such a state is already an eigenstate of all these observables. 
The measurement projects a noisy state onto an eigenstate of each M, with 
eigenvalue ±1. The string of n - k eigenvalues is the syndrome. Equations 
(7.67) guarantee that El and E2 have different syndromes, and so can be 
distinguished from each other. For, when the observable M is measured on the 
corrupted state Ell/» L' (7.67) means a different eigenvalue will be obtained 
when E = El than when E = E2. Therefore, the error can be deduced from 
the syndrome, and reversed by re-applying the deduced error to the system 
(taking advantage of the fact that error operators square to 1). 
Let us see how this whole process looks when applied to a general noisy 
encoded state. The noisy state is

245 
The syndrome extraction can be done most simply by attaching an n-k qubit 
ancilla a to the system, and storing in it the eigenvalues by a sequence of CNOT 
gates and Hadamard rotations. The exact network can be constructed either 
by thinking in terms of parity check information stored in the ancilla (c.f. 
Fig. 7.5), or by the following standard eigenvalue measurement method. To 
extract the). = ±1 eigenvalue of operator M, prepare an ancilla in (10) + 
11))/ J2. Operate controlled-M with ancilla as control, system as target, then 
Hadamard rotate the ancilla. The final state of the ancilla is [(1 + ).) 10) + 
(1 - ).) 11)]/2. Carrying out this process for the n - k operators M which 
span 1i, the effect is to couple system and environment with the ancilla as 
follows: 
(7.69) 
The s, are (n - k)-bit binary strings, all different if the E, all have different 
syndromes. A projective measurement of the ancilla will collapse the sum to 
a single term taken at random: I s,) a (E, I ¢) L) I 'IjJ,) e' and will yield s, as the 
measurement result. Since there is only one E, with this syndrome, we can 
deduce the operator E, which should now be applied to correct the error! 
This remarkable process can be understood as first forcing the general 
noisy state to 'choose' among a discrete set of errors, via a projective mea-
surement, and then reversing the particular discrete error 'chosen' using the 
fact that the measurement result tells us which one it was. Alternatively, 
the correction can be accomplished by a unitary evolution consisting of con-
trolled gates with ancilla as control, system as target, effectively transferring 
the noise (including entanglement with the environment) from system to an-
cilla. 
We left out of the above the other possibility mentioned just before (7.66), 
namely that 
(7.70) 
In this case El and E2 will have the same syndrome, so are indistinguishable 
in the syndrome extraction process. However, this does not matter! We simply 
interpret the common syndrome of these two errors as an indication that the 
corrective operation El should be applied. If it was El that occurred, this is 
obviously fine, while if in fact E2 occurred, the final state is EIE21 ¢) L which 
is also correct! This situation has no analogue in classical coding theory. The 
quantum codes which take advantage of it are termed degenerate and are not 
constrained by the quantum Hamming bound, (7.54). 
The discussion based on the stabiliser is useful because it focuses atten-
tion on operators rather than states. Quantum codewords are nevertheless 

246 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
very interesting states, having a lot of symmetry and interesting forms of 
entanglement. The codewords in the QECC can readily be shown to allow 
correction of the set S if and only if [323, 365] 
(u I EIE21 v) = 0 
(u I EIE21 u) = (v I EIE21 v) 
(7.71) 
(7.72) 
for all E 1,E2 E Sand lu),lv) E C,lu) =I- Iv). In the case that EIE2 al-
ways anticommutes with a member of the stabiliser, we have (u I EIE21 u) = 
(u I EIE2M I u) = - (u I MEIE21 u) = - (u I EIE21 u), therefore (u I EIE21 u) 
= O. This is a nondegenerate code; all the code vectors and their erroneous 
versions are mutually orthogonal, and the quantum Hamming bound must 
be satisfied. 
7.5.3 Code Construction 
The power of QEC results from the physical insights and mathematical tech-
niques already discussed, combined with the fact that useful QECCs can 
actually be found. Code construction is itself a subtle and interesting area, 
which we will merely introduce here. 
First, recall that we require the members of the stabiliser all to commute. 
It is easy to show that XuZv = (-1 )u.v ZvXu, where u . v is the binary 
parity check operation, or inner product between binary vectors, evaluated 
in GF(2). From this, M = XuZv and M' = Xu,Zv' commute if and only if 
u . v' + v . u' = o. 
(7.73) 
The stabiliser is completely specified by writing down the n - k linearly 
independent error operators which span it. It is convenient to write these 
error operators by giving the binary strings u and v which indicate the X 
and Z parts, in the form of two (n - k) x n binary matrices Hx, Hz. The 
whole stabiliser is then uniquely specified by the (n - k) x 2n binary matrix 
(7.74) 
and the requirement that the operators all commute (i.e. that 1i is an abelian 
group) is expressed by 
(7.75) 
where T indicates the matrix transpose. 
The matrix H is the analogue of the parity check matrix for a classical 
error correcting code. The analogue of the generator matrix is the matrix 
G = (GxIGz) satisfying 
(7.76) 

7.5 General Theory of Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance 
247 
In other words, Hand G are duals with respect to the inner product defined 
by (7.73). G has n+k rows. H may be obtained directly from G by swapping 
the X and Z parts and extracting the usual binary dual of the resulting 
(n + k) x 2n binary matrix. 
Note that (7.76) and (7.75) imply that G contains H. Let 9 be the set of 
error operators generated by G, then also 9 contains H. 
Since by definition (7.76), all the members of 9 commute with all the 
members ofH, and since (by counting) there can be no further error operators 
which commute with all of H, we deduce that all error operators not in 9 
anticommute with at least one member of H. This leads us to a powerful 
observation: if all members of 9 (other than the identity) have weight at 
least d, then all error operators (other than the identity) of weight less than 
d anticommute with a member of H, and so are detectable. Such a code can 
therefore correct all error operators of weight less than d12. 
What if the only members of 9 having weight less than d are also members 
of H? Then the code can still correct all error operators of weight less than 
d12, using property (7.70) (a degenerate code). The weight d is called the 
minimum distance of the code. 
The problem of code construction is thus reduced to a problem of finding 
binary matrices H which satisfy (7.75), and whose duals G, defined by (7.76), 
have large weights. We will now write down such a code by combining well-
chosen classical binary error correcting codes: 
(7.77) 
Here H t , i = 1,2, is the check matrix of the classical code Ct generated by 
Gt. Therefore HtG'[ = 0 and (7.76) is satisfied. To sat.isfy commutativity, 
(7.75), we force H 1Hf = 0, in other words, cf c C1 . By construction, if the 
classical codes have size k1' k2' then the quantum code has size k = k1 +k2 -no 
The quantum codewords are 
I u) L = L I x + u . D) , 
(7.78) 
xEct 
where u is a k-bit binary word, x is an n-bit binary word, and D is a (k x n) 
matrix of coset leaders. These are the CSS (Calderbank-Shor·-Steane) codes. 
Their significance is first that they can be efficient, and second that they are 
useful in fault-tolerant computing (see below). 
By "efficient" we mean t.hat there exist codes of given din whose rate 
kin remains above a finite lower bound, as k, n, d -+ 00. The CSS codes have 
d = min( d 1 , d2 ). If we choose the pair of classical codes in the construction 
to be the same, C 1 = C2 = C, then we are considering a classical code which 
contains its dual. A finite lower bound for the rate of such codes can be shown 
to exist [364]. This is highly significant: it means that QEC can be a very 
powerful method to suppress noise (see next section). 

248 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
There exist QECCs more efficient than CSS codes. Good codes can be 
found by extending CSS codes, and by other methods. For illustration, we 
finish this section with the stabiliser and generator of the [tn, k, d]] = [[5,1,3]] 
perfect code. It encodes a single qubit (k = 1), and corrects all errors of weight 
1 (since dj2 = l.5).

(7.79) 
Noise and decoherence are themselves a large subject. Here we will simply 
introduce a few basic ideas, in order to clarify what QEC can and cannot do. 
By 'noise' we mean simply any unknown or unwanted change in the density 
matrix of our system. 
The statement (7.62) about digitisation of noise is equivalent to the state-
ment that any interaction between a system of qubits and its environment 
has the form 
(7.80) 
where the operators H: act on the environment. Under the action of this cou-
pling, the density matrix of the system (after tracing over the environment) 
evolves from Po to 2::, a,E,poE,. QEC returns all terms of this sum having 
correctable E, to Po. Therefore, the fidelity of the corrected state, compared 
to the noise-free state Po, is determined by the sum of all coefficients a, 
associated with uncorrectable errors. 
For a mathematically thorough analysis of this problem, see [365, 366]. 
The essential ideas are as follows. Noise is typically a continuous process 
affecting all qubits all the time. However, when we discuss QEC, we can 
always adopt the model that the syndrome is extracted by a projective mea-
surement. Any statement such as 'the probability that error E, occurs' is just 
a short-hand for 'the probability that the syndrome extraction projects the 
state onto one which differs from the noise-free state by error operator E,'. 
We would like to calculate such probabilities. 
To do so, it is useful to divide up (7.80) into a sum of terms having error 
operators of different weight: 
HI = L 
E ® HE + L 
E ® HE + L 
E ® HE + .... 
wt(E)=l 
wt(E)=2 
wt(E)=3 
(7.81 ) 
There are 3n terms in the first sum, 32n!j(2!(n - 2)!) terms in the second, 
and so on. The strength of the system-environment coupling is expressed by 

7.5 General Theory of Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance 
249 
coupling constants which appear in the HE operators. In the case where only 
the weight 1 terms are present, we say the environment acts independently on 
the qubits: it does not directly produce correlated errors across two or more 
qubits. In this case, errors of all weights will still appear in the density matrix 
of the noisy system, but the size of the terms corresponding to errors of weight 
w will be O(E2w), where E is a parameter giving the system~environment 
coupling strength. 
Since QEC restores all terms in the density matrix whose errors are of 
weight:::; t = d12, the fidelity of the corrected state, in the uncorrelated noise 
model, can be estimated as one minus the probability P( t + 1) for the noise 
to generate an error of weight t + 1. This is probability is approximately 
(7.82) 
when all the single-qubit error amplitudes can add coherently (i.e. the qubits 
share a common environment), or 
P(t + 1) '::::' 3t+1 ( n ) E2(t+1) 
\t + 1 
(7.83) 
when the errors add incoherently (i.e. either seperate environments, or a 
common environment with couplings of randomly changing phase). The sig-
nificance of (7.82) and (7.83) is that they imply QEC works extremely well 
when t is large and E2 < t/3n. Since good codes exist, t can in fact tend to 
infinity while tin and kin remain fixed. Therefore, as long as the noise per 
qubit is below a threshold around t/3n, almost perfect recovery of the state is 
possible. The ratio tin constrains the rate of the code through the quantum 
Hamming bound or its cousins. 
Such uncorrelated noise is a reasonable approximation in many physical 
situations, but we need to be careful about the degree of approximation, 
since we are concerned with very small terms of order Ed. If we relax the 
approximation of completely uncorrelated noise, (7.82) and (7.83) remain 
approximately unchanged, if and only if the coupling constants in (7.81) for 
errors of weight t are themselves of order Et It!. 
A very different case in which QEC is also highly successful is when a set of 
correlated errors, also called burst errors, dominate the system~environment 
coupling, but we can find a QEC whose stabiliser includes all these correlated 
errors. This is sometimes called 'error avoiding' rather than 'error correction' 
since by using such a code, we don't even need to correct the logical state: 
it is already decoupled from the environment. The general lesson is that the 
more we know about the environment, and the more structure there exists in 
the system-environment coupling, the better able we are to find good codes.

7.5.5 Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation 
The above discussion of QEC is relevant to high-fidelity communication down 
noisy quantum channels, but it is not yet clear how relevant it may be to 
quantum computing. This is because so far we have assumed the quantum 
operations involved in syndrome extraction are themselves noise-free. There-
fore we are using processing power to combat noise, but it is not clear what 
degree of precision of the processing is necessary in order to gain something. 
Fault-tolerant computation is concerned with processing information re-
liably even when every elementary operation, and every period of free evolu-
tion, is itself noisy. One way to approach this is to use QEC repeatedly, but 
with the syndrome extraction procedure carefully constructed in such a way 
that it corrects more noise than it introduces. Most of the essential new in-
sights which permit us to do this were introduced by Shor [367] and helpfully 
discussed by Preskill [359]; see also [368]-[370]. Here we will adopt Shor's 
general approach, but with significant improvements introduced by Steane 
[371, 372]. Note that this subject is much less mature than QEC; many av-
enues remain unexplored. Here we will concentrate on explaining one method 
to extract syndromes in the right way. 
A complete fault-tolerant syndrome extraction network is shown in Fig. 7.8. 
For brevity, we consider the simplest case of a single-error correcting code; 
the ideas can be generalised to codes correcting many errors. The fundamen-
tal 2-state entities in the computer are called physical qubits. Each horizontal 
line in the network represents not a single physical qubit, but a block of n 
such qubits. Operators such as Hadamard and CNOT are applied across the 
relevant block or blocks, i.e. n operations, one for each qubit or pair of qubits. 
The method relies on the careful use of repetition, on the fact that X and 
Z errors propagate differently, and on useful properties of CSS codes. Define 
an error location to be any 1 or 2-qubit gate on physical qubits (including 
preparation and measurement operations), or the free evolution of any single 
physical qubit during one timestep. The noise is assumed to be un correlated 
and stochastic, so that failures occur independently with probability ~ ,. 
The aim of the whole network is to achieve a single-error correction of the 
computer block, in such a way that no failure at a single location can result 
in an error of weight ;::: 2 in the computer block. The idea is that while the 
syndrome extraction must make single-qubit errors in the computer more 

7.5 General Theory of Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance 
251 
likely, these are the very ones which are correctable. The important thing is 
not to generate uncorrectable errors with Db) probability. 
We begin by introducing 2 ancilla blocks, and preparing each in the logical 
zero state 10) L' Each preparation is not fault tolerant, it will fail in such a 
way that the prepared state can have any error of any weight with probability 
Db). Operate CNOT blockwise between the two ancillas, and measure all the 
bits of one of them in the computational basis. Here we are trying to verify 
that the correct state was prepared, using the fact that blockwise physical 
CNOT acts as a logical CNOT for a CSS code. Therefore, the measurement 
result should be a member of the classical code ct (7.78). If it is not, then 
reprepare the pair of ancillas and repeat until it is. At this stage, the proba-
bility for the remaining unmeasured ancilla to have X errors of weight ~ 2 is 
D(2 ), because it can only happen if failures occur in at least two locations. 
Note that the ancilla might still have Z errors of any weight. 
Now couple the verified ancilla to the computer by blockwise physical 
CNOT. Once again, we use the fact that this acts as logical CNOT, so there 
should be no effect! In fact something does happen: X errors propagate from 
ancilla to computer, and Z errors propagate from computer to ancilla. This 
is a sneaky, and fault tolerant, way to gather the Z-error syndrome into the 
ancilla. We read it out by Hadamard transforming the ancilla (to convert 
Z errors to bit flips) and measuring all the bits of the ancilla in the com-
putational basis. Here we have used the property, valid for a certain class 
of CSS codes, that blockwise physical H acts as logical H, so will keep the 
ancilla state in the encoded subspace, except for the Z errors which become 
X errors. 
There is still no single error location which can produce a weight-2 error in 
the computer, but now we are in danger, since there are many locations where 
a single failure would lead to an incorrect syndrome. If we were to 'correct' the 
computer on the basis of the wrong syndrome, we would actually introduce 
more errors. Therefore, the whole of the process described up till now is 
repeated. We finally end up with two syndromes. If they agree, then the only 
way they can be wrong is if failures occurred at two different locations, an 
D(2 ) process, so we go ahead and believe them. If they disagree, a third 
syndrome must be extracted, and we act on the majority vote. 
We have now completed the correction of Z errors in the computer (while 
generating further Z errors, which will be caught in the next round of cor-
rection). The second half of the network acts similarly, but now gathers up 
and corrects the X errors in the computer. 
Note that the whole process depends on the fact that X and Z errors 
propagate differently. We can fault-tolerantly verify the ancilla against X 
errors, but only by accepting the risk of having high-weight Z errors in the 
ancilla. This is OK because those Z errors stay put; they don't propagate 
up to the computer, they just make the syndrome wrong. We subsequently 
check for their presence by generating the syndrome again. Note also the 

252 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
heavy reliance on useful properties of CSS codes, such as their behaviour 
under blockwise gates. 
In a repeated series of error recoveries, each round of recovery corrects 
not just the errors developed in the computer during that round, but also 
the errors caused by the previous round (as long as they are correctable). 
It leaves uncorrected the errors it itself caused. The noise level accumulated 
after R rounds is therefore suppressed from O(R"() to O(R"(2 + "(), which is 
beneficial for large R and sufficiently small "(. 
To complete the task of fault tolerant computation, not just memory stor-
age, we need to be able to evolve the computer state through the desired 
quantum algorithm. We already saw how to perform logical Hadamard and 
CNOT operations on the state encoded by a CSS code: operate blockwise on 
the qubits. This is fault tolerant since each physical gate only connects to 
one physical qubit per block. To obtain a complete set of operations, we use 
the fact that the members of the continuous set of all gates can be approxi-
mated efficiently by using members of a discrete set. To complete the set, it 
is sufficient to have a fault-tolerant Toffoli gate, or one of a set of closely re-
lated gates, among which is the controlled-7r /2 rotation. Shor [367] proposed 
a (somewhat obscure) network for Toffoli. It is possible to understand the 
construction as related to teleportation. Teleportation can be understood as 
a form of fault tolerant swap operation, and it is useful for moving informa-
tion around fault-tolerantly in a quantum computer [372, 373]. These and 
other methods are under active investigation. 
At the time of writing, fault-tolerant computation based on repeated QEC 
seems to be the most promising way to realise large quantum algorithms, 
though the requirements on the physical hardware, both in terms of computer 
size and noise level, remain formidable. 
7.6 Frequency Standards

In this section the precision of frequency measurements based on trapped ions 
in the presence of decoherence is analysed. Different preparations of n two-
level systems are considered as well as different measurements procedures. 
We show in particular that standard Ramsey spectroscopy on uncorrelated 
ions and optimal measurements on maximally entangled states provide the 
same resolution. We suggest the use of symmetrisation procedures to reduce 
the undesired effects of decoherence and show that these allow one to exceed 
even the optimal precision achievable with optimised initial preparation of 
the n-ions state and optimised measurement scheme.

The aim of a frequency standard is to stabilise a reference oscillator to a 
given atomic frequency. The implementation of an optical frequency standard 
in an atomic trap according to standard Ramsey interferometry is illustrated 
in Fig. 7.9. 
The ion trap is loaded with n ions initially prepared in the same internal 
state 10) (we denote by 10) and 11) the ground and the excited states of each 
ion). A Ramsey pulse of frequency w is applied to all ions. The pulse shape and

Next the system evolves freely for a time t. In a reference frame rotating at 
the oscillator frequency w, the free evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian 
H = -/L111)(II, 
(7.85) 
where L1 = w -
Wo denotes the detuning between the classical driving field 
and the atomic transition. The evolution of the basis atomic states can then 
be represented as follows: 
(7.86) 
and the frequency difference between the atomic transition and the reference 
oscillator leads to the accumulation of a relative phase. If we now apply a 
second Ramsey pulse, the probability that an ion is found in the state 11) is 
given by 
p = 1 + cos(L1 t) .

7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
When this basic scheme is repeated yielding a total duration T of the ex-
periment, the resulting interference curve of the measured population in the 
upper state allows us to deduce the oscillator detuning and subsequently to 
adjust the frequency of the reference oscillator. At this point, one question 
arises. What is the best precision that can be achieved in the measurement 
of the atomic frequency? More precisely, given T and a fixed given number of 
ions n, what is the ultimate limit to the resolution of our frequency standard? 
The statistical fluctuations associated with a finite sample yield an un-
certainty L1P in the estimated value of P given by 
L1P = JP(1 - P)/N , 
(7.88) 
where N = nT /t denotes the actual number of experimental data (we assume 
that N is large). Hence the uncertainty in the estimated value of Wo is given 
by 
JP(I- P)/N 
1 
16wol = 
I dP/dw I 
= VnTt· 
(7.89) 
This value is often referred to as the shot noise limit [374J. We should stress 
that this limit comes from the intrinsically statistical character of quantum 
mechanics, in contrast to other possible sources of technical noise. While the 
latter may eventually be reduced, the shot noise poses a fundamental limit to 
the achievable resolution in precision spectroscopy with n independent par-
ticles. 
The theoretical possibility of overcoming this limit has been put forward re-
cently [375, 376]. The basic idea is to prepare the ions initially in an entangled 
state. To see the advantage of this approach, let us consider the case of two 
ions prepared in the maximally entangled state 
ItJi) = (100) + Ill) )/V2. 
(7.90) 
This state can be generated, for example, by the initial part of the network 
illustrated in Fig. 7.10. A Ramsey pulse on the first ion is followed by a 
controlled-NOT gate. After a free evolution period of time t the state of the 
composite system in the interaction picture rotating at the driving frequency 
w reads 
ItJi) = (100) + e2tL1t Ill»)/V2. 
(7.91 ) 
The second part of the network allows to disentangle the ions after the free 
evolution period. The population in state 11) of the first ion will now oscillate 
at a frequency 2L1:

This scheme can be easily generalised to the n-ion case by a sequence of 
controlled-NOT gates linking the first ion with each of the remaining ones. 
In this way, a maximally entangled state of n ions of the form 
IljI) = (100 ... 0) + 111 ... 1) )/)2 
(7.93) 
is generated. The final measurement on the first ion, after the free evolution 
period and the second set of controlled-NOT gates, gives the signal 
1 + cos(nLlt)

. 
(7.94) 
The advantage of this scheme is that the oscillation frequency of the signal 
is now amplified by a factor n with respect to the case of uncorrelated ions 
and the corresponding frequency uncertainty is

(7.95) 
Note that this result represents an improvement of a factor 1/ yin over the 
shot noise limit (7.89) by using the same number of ions n and the same total 
duration of the experiment T and it was argued that this is the best precision 
possible [377]. 
Let us now examine the same situation in a realistic experimental scenario, 
where decoherence effects are inevitably present. The main type of decoher-
ence in an ion trap is dephasing due to processes that cause random changes 
in the relative phase of quantum states while preserving the population in 
the atomic levels. Important mechanisms that result in dephasing effects are 
collisions, stray fields and laser instabilities. We model the time evolution of 
the reduced density operator for a single ion p in the presence of decoherence 
by the following master equation [378]: 
dp 
. 
dt = -zLl (pll),ll - 11),1Ip) + I (O"zpO"z - p) . 
(7.96) 
Equation (7.96) is written in a frame rotating at the frequency w. By o"z = 
10),01 -11)\11 we denote a Pauli spin operator. Here we have introduced the 

256 
7. Decoherence and Quantum Error Correction 
decay rate r = I/Tdec, where Tdec is the decoherence time. For the case of 
independent particles this will give rise to a broadening of signal (7.87): 
P = (1 + cos Ll te-,t)/2. 
(7.97) 
As a consequence the corresponding uncertainty in the atomic frequency is 
no longer detuning-independent. We now have 
Ibwol = 
1 - cos2 (Llt)e- 2,t 
nTte- 2,t sin2 (Llt) 
(7.98) 
In order to obtain the best precision it is necessary to optimise this expression 
as a function of the duration of each single measurement t. The minimal value 
is attained for 
Llt = k7r /2 (k odd) 
t = Tdec/2 
(7.99) 
provided that T > Tdec/2. Thus the minimum frequency uncertainty reads 
(7.100) 
For maximally entangled preparation, the signal (7.94) in the presence of 
dephasing is modified as follows: 
(7.101) 
and the resulting uncertainty for the estimated value of the atomic frequency 
is now minimal when 
Llt = k7r /2n (k odd) 
t = Tdec/2n . 
(7.102) 
Interestingly, we recover exactly the same minimal uncertainty as for stan-
dard Ramsey spectroscopy (7.100). This effect is illustrated in Fig.7.1l. The 
modulus of the frequency uncertainty Ibwol is plotted as a function of the 
duration of each single experiment t for standard Ramsey spectroscopy with 
n uncorrelated particles and for a maximally entangled state with n particles. 
In the presence of decoherence both preparations reach the same preci-
sion. This result can be intuitively understood by considering that maximally 
entangled states are much more fragile in the presence of decoherence: their 
decoherence time is reduced by a factor n and therefore the duration of each 
single measurement t has also to be reduced by the same amount. The previ-
ous conclusions hold whenever the total duration of the experiment exceeds 
the typical decoherence time. Hence, maximally entangled states are only 
advantageous for short term stabilisations. As far as long term experiments

are concerned, it has been shown recently [379] that the best resolution is 
achieved using partially entangled preparations with a high degree of sym-
metry. The procedure involves both an optimisation of the initial preparation 
of the state of the n ions and the final measurement after the free evolution 
region. However, from a practical point of view, the expected improvement 
is modest. The optimal percentual improvement in the precision relative to 
the limit (7.100) is of the order of 10% for n = 7. Asymptotic limits for large 
n are still under investigation. 
A very different approach to improving the resolution of a frequency stan-
dard by means of quantum entanglement is making use of error correction. 
As it has been shown in previous sections, these procedures can effectively 
reduce the amount of decoherence and dissipation in quantum systems. How-
ever, when established error correction protocols for phase-type errors are 
applied to this particular problem, difficulties arise. The use of error cor-
rection not only corrects phase errors due to environmental noise but also 
interferes with the desired change of relative phase in the atomic states that 
appears for a detuned oscillator, which is the quantity we want to estimate. 
This reduces the sensitivity of the frequency standard. Nevertheless, as will 
be shown, it is possible to stabilise the system against decoherence and over-
coming the optimal resolution achievable in the spectroscopy of uncorrelated 
particles. 
The key point is to realise that during the free evolution region, in the 
absence of decoherence, the state of n particles initially prepared in a state 
which is invariant under any permutation of the n ions always lies in the sym-
metric subspace of the Hilbert space of the composite system of the n ions 
(by symmetric subspace we mean the subspace which includes all the possible

tion of the global state into the symmetric subspace [380] would then yield a 
partial removal of events affected by environmental phase errors. Figure 7.12 
shows the percentual precision improvement achievable with this technique 
for n = 2. In this case a standard Ramsey scheme with initially uncorrelated 
ions has been considered and repeated symmetrisation steps are applied dur-
ing the free evolution region. After each symmetrisation step the ions are 
kept only if the symmetrisation is successful, otherwise they are discarded 
and reset to state 10) to start the scheme from the beginning. Although this 
reduces the number of experimental data available for statistics, Fig. 7.12 
shows that it is a convenient strategy to improve the overall precision of the 
experiment. 
The limits to the precision achievable with symmetrisation procedures for 
generic n and a generic initial preparation of the state of the ions are still 
under investigation. 
It should be noted that the symmetrization method is an error detection 
method rather than an error correction method. The symmetrization method 
simply removes erroneous states instead of correcting them. Although the re-
maining ensemble contains less errors the statistics of the experiment becomes 
worse due to the smaller number of systems that remain in the symmetric sub-
space. Overall a small improvement results. The application of true quantum

error correction codes in frequency standards is currently being investigated. 
Progress in this direction could potentially lead to substantially improved 
frequency standards. But even a proof that quantum error correction and en-
tanglement cannot improve the precision of frequency standards significantly 
would be very interesting. 
In this section we have presented the application of entanglement and 
quantum error correction in frequency standards. The motivation for this is 
that it is an application of the ideas of quantum information theory that 
requires only small quantum resources. One direction of future research in 
quantum information theory is certainly the development of other applica-
tions that require only small resources. Such applications could then be re-
alised experimentally in the near future. 

8. Entanglement Purification 
8.1 Introduction 
In Chap. 7 the theory of quantum error correction was presented. The present 
chapter describes an alternative method of overcoming decoherence which is 
particularly useful for quantum state communication. The main idea is to 
distill from a large set of (pairs of) entangled particles, possibly degraded 
in entanglement purity by decoherence, a subset of particles with enhanced 
entanglement purity. Section 8.2 describes the general principles of entangle-
ment purification. Specific examples are local filtering (Sect. 8.3), suitable for 
increasing the entanglement for pure states, and quantum privacy amplifica-
tion (Sect. 8.4), designed to increase the security of quantum cryptography 
over noisy quantum channels. The generalisation of purification to multi-
particle entanglement will be addressed in Sect. 8.5. Section 8.6 shows how 
to create maximally entangled EPR pairs between spatially distant atoms, 
each of them inside a high-Q optical cavity, by sending photons through a 
noisy channel, such as a standard optical fibre. As the absorption probability 
of photons during the transmission grows exponentially with the distance, 
so will the required number of repetitions for a successful transmission. Sec-
tion 8.7 presents the quantum repeater method, which reduces the growth of 
the required number of operations as function of the transmission distance 
from exponential to polynomial. 
8.2 Principles of Entanglement Purification 
H. -J. Briegel 
A central problem of quantum communication is the faithful transmission of 
quantum information from a party A (Alice) to some other party B (Bob) 
when the communication channel that connects A with B is noisy. The fidelity 
with which a quantum state is transmitted through a noisy quantum channel 
decreases, in general, exponentially with its length, so faithful transmission 
will be restricted to very short distances. This problem can be solved, in

principle, by the method of teleportation, which requires that A and B share 
a certain supply of pairs of particles in a maximally entangled state (EPR 
pairs). The question remains then, how can A and B create such entangled 
states if they can only communicate through noisy channels? Since entan-
glement cannot be created by local operations alone, A and B will have to 
send quantum bits through the channel at some point, to build up non-local 
quantum correlations. As these qubits interact with the channel, they are 
subject to decoherence and the resulting EPR pairs will not be maximally 
entangled, but instead be described by some mixed state with a certain en-
tanglement fidelity. The idea of entanglement purification is to extract from 
a large ensemble of such low-fidelity EPR pairs a smaller sub-ensemble with 
sufficiently high fidelity, which may then be used for faithful teleportation 
[49, 74] (Chap. 3) or for quantum cryptography [46,47] (Chap. 2). 
From the quantum communication perspective, there is a natural connec-
tion between entanglement purification and quantum error correction. The 
theory of quantum error correction has primarily been developed to make 
quantum computation possible despite the effects of decoherence and imper-
fect apparatus, but it can, of course, also be used to correct transmission 
errors. 1 Entanglement purification, on the other hand, is a more specific but 
powerful tool for quantum communication purposes. By exploiting classi-
cal communication between the parties, it allows highly efficient two-way 
protocols that cannot be realised with quantum error correction techniques. 
Furthermore, the method is remarkably robust with respect to imperfect ap-
paratus, which makes it very attractive for more advanced applications such 
as quantum repeaters [381]. A quantitative analysis of the connection between 
entanglement purification and quantum error correction is given in Ref. [323]. 
It should be emphasised that the issue of purifying (and quantifying) 
entanglement is of fundamental interest, regardless of the specific commu-
nicational applications that we have in mind today. We are likely to learn 
many more aspects of (multi-) particle entanglement in the future than we 
are presently aware of, and its applications might not be restricted to com-
putational and communicational tasks. In any case, it will be good to have 
entangled states in our laboratory, and we need to know how to generate and 
to purify them efficiently. 
So what is entanglement purification? 
To illustrate the main ideas we first consider an ensemble of spin 1/2 particles 
that are partially polarised along a certain direction (z say). For simplicity, 
we may assume that we are dealing with an incoherent mixture of particles 
in state I t) == Ispin up) and I -t) == Ispin down), respectively, represented 
by the density matrix 
p = II t) (t I + (1 - f) I -t) (-t I , 
(8.1) 
1 In fact, classzcal error correction was originally developed for just that purpose 
[32].

Fig. 8.1. Selection of spin-polarised atoms with Stern-Gerlach magnets: An in-
homogeneous magnetic field in z direction, generated by two magnets (S and N), 
is used to spatially separate particles with different spin. For brevity, we call this 
arrangement a "Stern-Gerlach apparatus." 
although this restriction is not essential for the following argument. We can 
easily select the subensemble of particles in state 1 t) by measuring the par-
ticles' spin along the z axis, e.g. by sending them through a Stern-Gerlach 
(SG) apparatus as shown in Fig. 8.1. By selecting only those particles that 
leave the apparatus along the upper path (which will be the case for a frac-
tion f of all particles, on average ), we will obviously create a subensemble of 
particles in the pure state p' = 1 t) (t I. We could say that we have "purified" 
the whole ensemble by "distilling" the particles with the desired polarisation, 
although this terminology would sound rather forced, at this point. 
For reasons that will become clear, imagine a slightly more complicated 
situation where, by some unknown mechanism, the particles are destroyed 
(e.g. absorbed) after they have passed through the SG apparatus! We only 
assume that the apparatus delivers us with a click if a particle goes through 
the upper hole in Fig. 8.1 and nothing otherwise, absorbing all of the par-
ticles. How could we use such a deficient apparatus to purify our ensemble'? 
A possibility would be to not send the particles themselves through the SG 
apparatus but a copy of them, instead. Although it is impossible to copy a 
general quantum state (no-cloning theory, Sect. 2.2.2 [88]) it is possible to 
copy the selected basis states using an auxiliary particle C and the measure-
ment gate (or CNOT gate). The measurement gate has been described in 
Sect. 1.6: If the initial state of the particle C is 1 t)c, its effect is to copy the

Applied to the ensemble (8.1), the measurement gate creates two (classically)

gate. 
4 This is true if the auxiliary particles C are initially in the state I t)c. 

8.2 Principles of Entanglement Purification 
265 
If we now measure the spin value of an auxiliary particle, we still destroy that 
particle, but a click will indicate that the corresponding left-behind particle 
A is in the pure state P~ = 1 t)A(t 1 (see Fig. S.2a). By measuring the copy 
of every particle, we simply check which of the particles are in the right state 
and can therefore select a purified subensemble. 
Obviously, there is a catch: By assuming that we have auxiliary particles 
in the pure state 1 t)C available, the whole purification idea seems to be point-
less, since we could have used those auxiliary particles from the beginning, 
instead of our impure ensemble. 
So what can we do if we do not have perfectly polarised spins for copying? 
The important point is that we may as well use particles taken from the 
impure ensemble itself, for this purpose. As long as 1 > 1/2, it is more likely 
that some randomly selected particle (for copying) is in the correct internal 
state 1 t)c and can thus be used to check the unknown state of some other 
particle of the ensemble. To see this quantitatively, imagine that we divide 
the initial ensemble, which we want to purify, into two sub ensembles PA and 
Pc of the same size (we write two different indices A and C to distinguish 
their roles in the measurement gate). Both subensembles will be described 
by the same density matrix (S.6), see also Fig. S.2b. Now for every atom in 
the ensemble A, we pick an atom from the ensemble C and copy the state 
of A onto C with the aid of the measurement gate. After this procedure has 
been done for all particles, we obtain the following ensemble, 
PAC = (121 t)A(t 1 + (1- f) 2 1·l-)A(-l- I) 01 t)C(t 1 
+1(1- f) (I t)A(t 1 + 1 -l-)A(-l- I) 01 -l-)C(-l- I· 
(S.4) 
We now measure the state of the particles C and collect all those particles 
of the ensemble A, whose copy is found in state 1 t)C ("click"), into a new 
ensemble. This new ensemble is then described by the density operator 
(S.5) 
with l' = 12/(f2 + (1 - f)2). The simple function 1'(f) is identical to the 
one plotted in Fig. S.4, where we will discuss the purification of mixed en-
tangled states. For 1 > 1/2, we thus obtain a purified ensemble with a larger 
fraction l' > 1 of particles in the state 1 t) A. If we iterate this procedure, as 
indicated by the staircase in Fig. S.4, we are able to d2st2ll particles with a 
state arbitrarily close to the pure state 1 t) A, as long as the initial ensemble 
is sufficiently large.5 
We are now ready to discuss the purification of mixed entangled states. 
Imagine that Alice and Bob want to purify an ensemble of two-particle entan-
gled states P AB, where their particles A and B are kept at different locations. 
Consider the following simple example 
5 Strictly speaking, to distill pure states by this method, the initial ensemble has 
to be infinitely large.

with the Bell states 
and 
and 1/2 < f < 1. Unless f = 1/2, the state (8.6) is inseparable. We may re-
gard (8.6) as a classical mixture of two ensembles of (pure) Bell states I<p+) AB 
and Ip+)AB of size f and (1- f), respectively.6 Clearly, by sending both par-
ticles through a corresponding SG apparatus on each side, Alice and Bob 
can distinguish the two subensembles: For pairs in the state I<p+) AB, both 
particles will leave the apparatus on similar paths ("up-up" or "down-down") 
while for pairs in state Ip+) AB they will leave the apparatus along different 
paths ("up-down" or "down-up"), assuming that both Alice and Bob have 
aligned their SG apparatuses in the z-direction. On the other hand, this mea-
surement will destroy any previously existing entanglement, and the particles 
will leave the apparatuses in a product state. The problem is therefore: How 
can Alice and Bob select the sub ensemble described by I<p+) AB if, by a local 
measurement, they destroy the entanglement? 
To solve this problem, we may use our insights from the previous discus-
sion of one-particle purification. Can Alice and Bob apply the trick with the 
measurement gate and send "copies" of A and B through the SG apparatuses, 
instead of the particles themselves? They can, in fact, if the initial state of 
the particles used for the copying is itself entangled. To see this, consider the 
situation where Alice and Bob share two pairs, one pair AB from the ensem-
ble (8.6) and a second pair A'B' in the pure state I<p+) A' B'. Now they copy 
the state of the pair AB onto the pair A'B' by applying the measurement 
gate of (8.2) on both sides, that is, between particles A and A', and Band 
B', respectively. The result of this operation can be summarised as follows: 
6 The fraction f = (P+IPABlp+)AB in (8.6) is also called the "entanglement fi-
delity" (or simply fidelity) of the mixed state PAB with respect to the Bell state 
Ip+)AB.

1l/i+)ABI<1>+)A'B' -+ 1l/i+)ABIl/i+)A'B'. 
(8.7) 
This bi-lateral (CNOT) operation obviously acts like a measurement gate for 
pairs where the states 1<1>+) and Iq;+) play the analogs of 1 t) and 1 -l-) in (8.2). 
This means that, if Alice and Bob share some pairs in the state 1<1>+) A' B', 
they can use them to check the state of randomly chosen pairs of the ensemble 
(8.6) and thereby select the desired subensemble. The problem is, of course, 
that they do not have auxiliary pairs in the state 1<1>+) AB ! (otherwise there 
would be no need for purification). But ~ remember the previous discussion 
for single-particle states ~ Alice and Bob may equally well use pairs from 
the mixed ensemble itself, as long as the majority of them is in the right 
initial state 1<1>+) (i.e. 1 > 1/2). So the protocol is very similar to that for 
the one-particle purification (see Fig. 8.3): 
1. Alice and Bob pick randomly two pairs of the ensemble (8.6) and use one 
of the pairs to measure the state of the other pair; i.e. 
2. they apply the CNOT gate between corresponding particles on each side; 
3. they measure the state of the auxiliary pair, e.g with two SG apparatuses 
as in Fig. 8.3 (and thus destroy its entanglement). 
By keeping only those pairs for which the measurement results give the same 
spin value, (up-up or down-down) they can select a new ensemble that is 
described by the density operator 
(8.8) 
with a larger fraction I' = P / (12 + (1- J)2) > 1 (for 1 > 1/2) of pairs in the 
state 1<1>+)AB (see Fig. 8.4). Note that, in order to compare the outcomes of 
their measurements and thus to decide which pairs to keep or to discard, Alice 
and Bob have to communicate and exchange classical information, which is 
an integral part of any purification protocol. By iterating this procedure as 
indicated by the staircase in Fig. 8.4, Alice and Bob can distill an ensemble 
of pairs with entanglement fidelity 1 arbitrary close to unity. 
It seems that with (8.6), we have discussed a rather special case of a mixed 
two-particle state, but the method also works for general states PAB, as long 
as they contain a sufficiently large fraction 1 = (<1>meIPABI<1>me) > 1/2 of 
particles in a maximally entangled state 1 <1>me) .7 The first entanglement pu-
rification protocol for general mixed entangled states was given by Bennett 
et al. [49J. It allows one to distill from a large ensemble of entangled states 
with fidelity 1 > 1/2 a smaller ensemble of pairs with fidelity 1 arbitrarily 
close to unity. These pairs can then be used for faithful teleportation through 
7 By this we mean any state that is, up to local unitary transformations on Alice's 
and Bob's particle, equivalent to one of the four (and thus to all) Bell states. 
Typically, at some point of a protocol that works with general mixed states PAB, 
the dominant component l<Pme, of PAB is transformed into the Bell state I<p+, 
before the bilateral CNOT operation is applied.

a noisy quantum channel. A second protocol, called "quantum privacy ampli-
fication," (QPA) was given by Deutsch et al. [47]. Apart from differences in 
the details (such as the efficiency in producing singlets), both protocols use 
the measurement gate as a central ingredient to perform measurements on 
non-local entangled states without destroying their entanglement. The prime 
motivation of QPA lies in its application to entanglement-based quantum 
cryptography [46], by establishing a procedure that allows Alice and Bob, in 
principle, to disentangle a potential eavesdropper from a selected subset of 
pairs, which may subsequently be used for quantum key distribution. This 
method of quantum privacy amplification will be reviewed in Sect. 8.4 
It should be emphasised that the method which we have described above 
to illustrate the idea of entanglement purification is not the only way of pu-
rifying entangled states. There are more sophisticated methods (using e.g. 
multi-particle measurements) that exploit ideas from classical information 
theory such as random hashing [49, 323] to increase the efficiency of the pro-
tocols. Another interesting and simple method, which is particularly suited 
for increasing the entanglement of pure states, is local filtering [117, 382], 
which will be described in more detail in Sect. 8.3. There have also been a se-
ries of further developments in the theory of entanglement purification since 
the first ideas where formulated a few years ago, but we cannot discuss these 
in this elementary introduction. Examples include the important notion of 
"bound entanglement" [383], the discussion of optimal purification protocols 
[322, 323, 384, 385], and the efficiency and the robustness of purification pro-
tocols under imperfect local operations [381, 386, 387]. A generalisation of 
entanglement purification for multi-particle entangled states is discussed in 
Sect. 8.5. 

8.3 Local Filtering

8.3 Local Filtering 
B. Huttner, N. Gisin 
For entanglement purification one considers an unlimited number of pairs 
of quantum systems, all in the same (possibly mixed) state Pin. The task is 
to extract from this a fraction of maximally entangled pure states, by using 
only local operations and classical communication. Let us first consider the 
case of a pure entangled state of two quantum systems Pin = l1,Uin)(1,UinI· We 
shall show that it can always be "purified" by local filtering to the 2-qubits 
singlet state ~(I01) -
110). This introduces the concept of local filtering, 
a particularly simple example of entanglement purification, and shows that 
for entanglement purification in general it suffices to consider purification 
towards singlet states [382]. 
Using the Schmidt decomposition, 1,Uin can always be written as: 
N 
1,Uin = L cJcxJ ® {3J 
(8.9) 
J=l 
where {cxJ } and {{3J} are orthonormal bases of the Hilbert spaces of the 2 
entangled quantum systems. Since the state 1,Uin is assumed entangled, there 
are at least 2 non-vanishing cJ ' hence we may assume C1 1:: 0 and C2 1:: O. To 
purify 1,Uin Alice, who holds the system in states cx J' and Bob, who holds the 
{3J' first measure the projectors Pal + Pa2 and P(3, + P(32' respectively. By 
classical communication, Alice and Bob keep only the pairs that give positive 
outputs to the measurements. These pairs are in the following state: 
(8.10) 
Hence each subsystem involves only two orthogonal states, like qubits. Let 
us assume that ICl12 ~ IC212, then Alice and Bob apply locally 2 filters FA 
and FE that attenuate CX1 and {31 while letting CX2 and {32 through unaffected. 
These filters are represented by the following positive operators: 
and 
(8.11) 
Using the classical communication channel, Alice and Bob select only those 
pairs of systems that passed both filters. (Actually, it suffices if only Alice or 
only Bob measures her (his) operator and act with a filter). Notice that such 
filters really exist. For example optical elements with polarisation-dependent 
loss are common. For an experimental example in quantum optics, see for 
instance [388]. The state of the filtered systems has equal weights on both 
product states: 

270 
8. Entanglement Purification 
(8.12) 
Finally, Alice and Bob only need to fix the relative phase between 0'1 ® f31 
and 0'2 ® f32 to obtain the desired singlet state (up to an irrelevant global 
phase): 
(8.13) 
In full generality, the problem of entanglement purification is more com-
plex (for more than 2 entangled systems, the general solution is not even 
known). However, the relatively simple filters presented above can also be 
used to purify some mixed states, as will be shown now. Inspired by the 
above results, let us consider the following mixture of 2-qubit states: 
(8.14) 
where .\ and c are two real numbers between a and 1, and 
1/;c = clIO) - ~101), 
1/;11 = 111), 
1/;00 = 100) . 
(8.15) 
Before showing how the state p(.\, c) can be purified, we would like to prove 
that this state can never violate the Bell-CHSH inequality [12]. For this 
purpose, we use a powerful result by the Horodecki family [389], which applied 
to state p(.\, c) concludes that for 
1 
1 
---=== < .\ < ----:,...,----;:-:-
2 - 2cVf=C2 
-
1 + c2 (1 - c2 ) 
(8.16) 
no violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality can happen. Hence p(.\, c) is ap-
parently local, though below we show that p(.\, c) can be purified to singlet 
states and that consequently p(.\, c) is in fact nonlocal. 
The procedure to purify p(.\, c) is actually quite similar to the example 
presented above: Alice and Bob apply the filters (8.11) with C1 = c and 
C2 = Vf=C2. The filtered state reads: 
Pfiltered(.\, c) = FA ® FE Pin('\, c) FA ® FE = 
~ (2'\C~ 
Psinglet + 1 ; .\ (P1/Jl1 + P1/Joo)) 
( 8.17) 
with the normalisation factor N = 2'\cVf=C2 + (1 - .\). 
Using again Horodeckis theorem [389], one sees that this state violates 
the Bell-CHSH inequality iff

8.4 Quantum Privacy Amplification 
271 
The upper and lower bounds on >. defined by the conditions (8.16) and (8.18) 
are compatible provided cVf="C2 :::; J2 - 1. Hence there are values of >. 
and c such that the state p(>., c) is "local", in the sense that no Bell-CHSH 
inequality is violated, and such that the corresponding state filtered by the 
local environments, Pfiltered (>., c), violates some Bell-CHSH inequality. 
Above we have identified "local" ~ "no violation of Bell-CHSH inequal-
ity". In this way the results appear somewhat more dramatic! But clearly this 
identification can and should be criticized. A state that is explicitly nonlocal 
after some local interactions does not deserve the qualification of local. An 
open question is whether the states p(a, >.) satisfying (8.16) and (8.18) admit 
a local hidden variable model reproducing all correlations. Since it does not 
violate any Bell-CHSH inequality, it is plausible that such a model exists. 
However, even if such a local hidden model exists, the state should be called 
nonlocal, because reproducing all correlations is not enough, as illustrated by 
the example presented above.

C. Macchiavello 
The purpose of entanglement purification schemes is to distill a subset of 
states with enhanced purity from a larger set of non-pure entangled states. 
The first scheme of this kind was proposed in [49] and it was shown that 
this allows faithful teleportation of quantum states via noisy channels. A 
subsequent more efficient purification scheme was presented in [47], named 
"quantum privacy amplification" (QPA) because it was de::;igned for crypto-
graphic purposes. Actually, it was proved that it leads to ::;ecurity of quantum 
cryptography over noisy channels (in the entanglement based scheme [46] also 
presented in Chap. 2). In this section we describe how the QPA scheme works. 
Let us assume that pairs of qubits in maximally entangled states are 
generated and distributed to two users, Alice and Bob, via a noisy quantum 
channel. Becau::;e of the noise along the transmission channel the distributed 
pairs interacting with the environment get entangled with it, lose their purity 
and become mixed states. Acting on the received pairs, Alice and Bob want 
to enhance their purity. Let us assume that many pairs are distributed and 
the channel acts in the same way on all of them. We will de::;cribe the states 
of the pair::; in the Bell basis representation

8. Entanglement Purification 
where {I 0) , II)} represents a basis for each particle belonging to the pairs. 
We assume that each pair is initially generated in state I ¢+) and denote by 
{a, b, c, d} the diagonal components of the density operator p of the "noisy" 
pairs that Alice and Bob receive in the basis {I ¢+) , 17/;-) , 17/;+) ,I ¢-)}. The 
first diagonal element a = (¢+ I P I ¢+), which we call the 'fidelity', is the 
probability that the pair would pass a test for being in the state I ¢+). The 
purpose of QPA is to drive the fidelity to 1 (which implies that the other 
three diagonal elements go to 0). We note that it is not necessary to specify 
the whole density matrix of the noisy pairs because in the QPA algorithm the 
off-diagonal elements do not contribute on average (i.e. averaging over the 
ensemble of distributed pairs at each step of the procedure) to the evolution 
of the diagonal ones and therefore they are not significant in the study of the 
efficiency of the scheme. 
In the QPA procedure Alice and Bob divide the received noisy pairs into 
groups of two pairs each and perform the following operations on each group. 
Alice performs the unitary operation 
1 (1 -i) 
UA = y'2 -i 1 
(8.21 ) 
on each of her two qubits; Bob performs the inverse operation 
1 (1 i) 
UB = y'2 
i 1 
(8.22) 
on his. Note that if the qubits are spin-~ particles and the computation basis 
is that of the eigenstates of the z components of their spins, then the two 
operations correspond respectively to rotations by 7r /2 and -7r /2 about the 
x axis. 
Then Alice and Bob each perform two instances of the quantum Controlled-
NOT operation, described in Sect. 1.6, 
control target

(x,y) E {D,I}, 
(8.23) 
where one pair comprises the two control qubits and the other one the two 
target qubits, and EB denotes addition modulo two (a useful table describing 
the action of this bilateral Controlled-NOT operation in the Bell basis can be 
found in [49]). Alice and Bob then measure the target qubits in the compu-
tational basis (e.g. they measure the z components of the targets' spins). If 
the outcomes coincide (e.g. both spins up or both spins down) they keep the 
control pair for the next round, and discard the target pair. If the outcomes 
do not coincide, both pairs are discarded. The basic operations of the QPA 
procedure are systematically reported in Fig. 8.5. 
To see the effect of this procedure, let us assume that each pair is ini-
tially in the same state with diagonal elements {a, b, c, d}. In the case where 
the control qubits are retained, their density operator will have diagonal ele-
ments {A, B, C, D} which depend, on average, only on the diagonal elements 
{a, b, c, d}:

then iterated by applying again the above elementary step to the surviving 
pairs from the previous iteration. Note that if the average value of the fidelity 
is driven to 1 then each of the surviving pairs must individually approach the 
pure state 11>+) (1)+ I· 
In passing we note that if the two input pairs are described by different 
density operators p and p' with diagonal elements {a, b, e, d} and {a', b', e', d'} 
respectively, then the retained control pairs will, on average, have diagonal

8. Entanglement Purification 
Several interesting properties of the QPA map (8.24-8.27) can be easily 
verified. For example if at any stage the fidelity a exceeds ~, then after one 
more iteration, it still exceeds ~. Although a does not necessarily increase 
monotonically as a function of the number of iterations, our target point, 
A = 1, B = C = D = 0, is a fixed point of the map, and is the only fixed 
point in the region a > ~. It can be easily seen analytically that it is a local 
attractor, namely that A > a for a close to 1. 
An analytical proof that it is also a global attractor in the region a > ~ 
has been recently obtained [390]. The proof is based on showing that the 
function f(a, b) = (2a - 1)(1 - 2b) is monotonic as a function of the number 
of iterations and asymptotically approaches unity. This implies that if we 
begin with pairs whose average fidelity exceeds ~, but which are otherwise 
in an arbitrary state containing arbitrary correlations with the environment, 
then the states of pairs surviving after successive iterations always converge 
to the unit-fidelity pure state I ¢+). It can also be shown [390] that the QPA 
procedure is always successful for any initial value b > ~ (leading to the pure 
state I ¢+)) and for any initial value c > ~ or d > ~ (leading in this case to 
the pure state 1'ljJ+)). In contrast, when none of the diagonal elements of the 
initial density operator exceeds 1/2 the procedure does not work. 
Notice also that the QPA is capable of purifying a collection of pairs in 
any state p whose average fidelity with respect to at least one maximally 
entangled state (i.e. a Bell state or a state obtained from a Bell state via 
local unitary operations) is greater than ~. This is due to the fact that any 
state of that type can be transformed into I ¢+) via local unitary operations 
[73]. If we denote by B the class of pure, maximally entangled states (the 
generalised Bell states) then the condition that the state p can be purified 
using the QPA is given by 
1 
max (¢ I p I ¢) > -. 
fEB 
2 
(8.32) 
The speed and the convergence behaviour of the procedure depends on the 
value of the diagonal elements of the initial density operator. As an example, 
in Fig. 8.6 we plot the fidelity as a function of the initial fidelity and the 
number of iterations, in cases where a > ~ and b = c = d initially. 
The QPA procedure is rather wasteful in terms of discarded particles: 
at least one half of the particles (the ones used as targets) is lost at every 
iteration. Still the efficiency of this scheme compares favourably with the 
first proposed entanglement purification scheme described in [49] (about 1000 
times more efficient for a close to 0.5, i.e. the number of surviving pairs is 
1000 times bigger for a prescribed value of final fidelity).

to Multi-Particle Entanglement 
M. Murao, M.B. Plenio, S. Popescu, V. Vedral, P.L. Knight 
In this section, direct purification protocols proposed in [391] are described 
for a wide range of mixed diagonal states of N particle entanglement. Al-
though the procedures are not as general as those for two-particle purifica-
tion of Bennett et al. [49] and Deutsch et al. [47], they are important for our 
understanding of multi-particle entanglement and have important practical 
applications. For many spin-l/2 particles, the maximally entangled states are 
I<t>±) = ~ 
(100 .. ·0) ± 111 .. ·1)) , 
(8.33) 
together with those that are locally unitarily equivalent. The state for each 
particle is written in the {IO) ,II)} basis; for three particles, these are called 
GHZ states [290]. 
Purification procedures [47, 49, 117, 382] "distill" from an ensemble of 
entangled mzxed states a sub-ensemble of maximally entangled pure states 
by using local operations and classical communications. For two particles, 
the singlet state I'l/'J-) = (10l) -110)) /v2, which is totally antisymmetric, is 
invariant under any bilateral rotation and plays an important role in these 
purification schemes. 
However, for three or more particles, there is no maximally entangled state 
which is invariant under trilateral (multi-lateral) rotations (for a classification 
of entangled states based on invariance under local unitary transformations, 

276 
8. Entanglement Purification 
see [392]). Local rotations map maximally entangled states into a superpo-
sition of maximally entangled states (unless we have trivial rotations by mf 
where n is a integer). This makes it more difficult to transform an arbitrary 
state into one of the Werner states, which makes the search for general pu-
rification protocols much less straightforward. 
Although there is no maximally entangled state invariant under random 
bilateral rotations for N ~ 3 (where N is the number of entangled particles), 
we will call the state 
I-x 
pw = X I¢>+) (¢>+I + 2JVl 
(8.34) 
a "Werner-type state" because of the similarity with the two particle case. 
Note that we write I¢>+) instead of I'if'-) for convenience. The aim of purifi-
cation is the distillation of a sub-ensemble in the state I¢>+). The fidelity, 
(8.35) 
of the Werner-type state is f = x + (1- x) /2 N . These Werner-type states are 
important practically, because mixed entangled states are likely to appear 
when one has an ensemble of initially maximally entangled states (for exam-
ple, I¢>+)) of N particles, and then transmits the N particles to N different 
parties via noisy channels (Fig. 8.7). 
Consider the effect of a noisy channel, whose action on each particle can be 
expressed by random rotations about random directions. Each noisy channel 
causes random rotations (around a random direction and by a random angle) 
with probability 1 - x, but leaves the particle unaffected with probability x. 
The state after transmission through such a channel becomes the Werner-type 
state given by (8.34). 
In the following, a protocol is presented (Pl+P2 in Fig. 8.8), which can 
purify a Werner-type state, provided the fidelity of the initial mixed state is

higher than a certain critical value. The advantage of this protocol is that 
Werner-type states for any number of particles can be dzrectly purified. 
In the protocol Pl+P2, each party (Alice, Bob et al.) perform iterations 
of the operations PI followed by P2 on the particles belonging to them . 
• The operation PI consists of a local Hadamard transformation which maps 
10) -+ (IO)+ll))/V2, 11) -+ (IO)-ll))/V2, a local CNOT (Controlled 
NOT) operation and a measurement Ml, and another local Hadamard 
transformation. In Ml, we keep the control qubits if an even number of 
target qubits are measured to be in the state 11), otherwise the control 
qubits are discarded. For example when purifying for three particles, we 
only keep 1000), 1011), 1101), 1110) . 
• The operation P2 consists of a local CNOT operation and a measurement 
M2 in which we keep the control qubits if all target bits are measured 
to be in the same state, otherwise the control qubits are discarded. For 
example, when purifying three particles, we only keep 1000) and 1111). 
In this operation, the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the density 
matrix are independent of each other, so that the off-diagonal elements do 
not affect the purification. 
The purification scheme, however, is not restricted to Werner-states. 
There are several types of states which can be purified by the protocol PI or 
P2 alone. For example, if the initial mixed state does not have any weight 
of the pairing state (we call the state 14>-) the "pairing state" of 14>+)) and 
weights of other states are equal (or even when some weights are zero), iter-
ations of the operation P2 only are sufficient to purify the initial ensemble to 
the 14>+) state (see [391] for more in detail). 
In the purification protocols discussed above, many-particle entangled 
states are directly purified. This is necessary for fundamental investigation 
of characteristic multi-particle entanglement. However, one could imagine

schemes which purify many-particle entanglement via two-particle purifica-
tion: one of these schemes for three particles (of Alice, Bob, and Claire) uses 
the fact that we know how to purify two particles. So this scheme converts 
three-particle states into two-particle states, then purifies these two-particle 
states, and finally re-converts them to three-particle entangled states. The al-
gorithm for this protocol appears more complicated when described in words, 
so we provide a figure (Fig. 8.9) to help the reader visualise the entire scheme. 
This involves the following: 
1. Divide the entire ensemble of the state for three particles into two equal 
sub-ensembles. 
2. Bob then projects particles of one sub-ensemble onto 
and Claire performs the same projection using the other sub-ensemble. 
When Bob or Claire obtain a successful projection onto Ix- ), then they 
instruct Alice to perform the a z operation on her particles. If they obtain 
a successful projection onto Ix+), then Alice is instructed to do nothing. 
The end product of these operations are two sub-ensembles of two-particle 
entangled states (one pair shared by Alice and Bob, and another pair 
shared by Alice and Claire). 
3. Then Alice and Bob, and separately Alice and Claire perform the two-
particle purification protocol in [47, 117] to each of the entangled sub-
ensembles of two particles. This results in two maximally entangled en-
sembles of pairs of particles, shared between Alice and Bob, and between 
Alice and Claire. 
4. Alice now wants to obtain a single GHZ state out of two maximally 
entangled pairs shared between herself and Bob and Claire. To do this, 
she chooses one entangled pair from each sub-ensemble and then performs

particle onto 10) or 11). If Alice obtains a successful projection onto 11), 
she instructs Claire to perform the cy x operation on her particle, and 
otherwise, do nothing. Then we obtain a sub-ensemble containing the 
maximally entangled GHZ state [300, 303]. 
We now analyse this indirect scheme and compare it to the direct purifi-
cation schemes. Any efficient direct three-particle purification scheme should 
perform better than this indirect method via two particles. We note that we 
only obtain one maximally entangled state of three particles from two maxi-
mally entangled states of two particles by this scheme (Fig. 8.10, in detail see 
[391]). For purification of N-particle entangled states, we get one maximally 
entangled state from N - 1 maximally entangled states of two particles. In 
addition, the number of two-qubit CNOT operations, each of which is difficult 
in practice to carry out to high accuracy, is greater than in our direct scheme. 
These "inefficiencies" are the main practical disadvantage of the two-particle 
scheme. 
For two-particle entanglement, an initial fidelity f > 1/2 is sufficient for 
successful purification [47] if we have no knowledge of the initial state. The 
situation is different if we possess additional information about the state, in 
which case any entangled state can be purified [50]. However, the sufficiency 
condition is not as simple for more than three particles. \Ve have found several 
different criteria, depending on the type of mixed states. 
For the Werner-type states of the the form pw = x I¢+) (¢+I + 12~x 1, and 
purification by the protocol PI + P2, we obtain numerically the results shown 
in Table 8.1.

The theoretical fidelity limit for the Werner-type states pw of the pu-
rification scheme via two-particle purification is determined by the condi-
tion that the fidelity IT of the reduced two-particle states should satisfy 
IT > 1/2. For example, for three particles, the Werner state having ini-
tial fidelity I = x + (1 - x) /8 is reduced to a two-particle state after the 
measurement of Bob or Claire as follows 
(8.36) 
The fidelity of the reduced two-particle state is now IT = (1 + 61) /7. For four 
particles, we have IT = (1 + 4/) /5, for five particles, IT = (7 + 241) /31, for 
six particles, IT = (5 + 161) /21 and so on. We see from Table 8.1 that the 
protocol P1+P2 is not optimal for two particles. So it may not be optimal 
for N > 2. However, for more than three particles, our observed fidelity 
limit is lower than that obtained by the purification scheme via two-particle 
purification. 
For states having no weight of 1<1>-) (<1>-1 and equal weight of all other 
states except 1<1>+) (<1>+1, the fidelity limit of purification by the protocol P2 is 
I > 2-(N -1). The fidelity limit obtained by the purification scheme via two-
particle purification is 2/5 = 0.4 for the three-particle case, 65/23 ~ 0.35846 
for the four-particle case, 125/377 ~ 0.328912 for five-particle case and so 
on, i.e. worse than that in our protocols. 
As we have seen, the fidelity limit of purifiable initial states depends on 
the distribution of the weight of other diagonal states. This is a condition 
of a different character from the case of two particles [47]. For two particles, 
the distribution of weights of other diagonal elements was basically irrelevant 
for purification, since any distribution of weights of the other diagonal can 
be transformed into an even distribution by local random rotations of both 
particles, without changing the amount of entanglement. This suggests that 
there may be additional structure for many-particle entangled mixed states, 
which does not exist for two-particle mixed states.

We show how to create maximally entangled EPR pairs between spatially dis-
tant atoms, each of them inside a high-Q optical cavity, by sending photons 
through a general, noisy channel, such as a standard optical fibre. An error 
correction scheme that uses few auxiliary atoms in each cavity effectively 
eliminates photon absorption and other transmission errors. For communica-
tion over distances much longer than the absorption length or the coherence 
length of the channel, we describe a novel nested purification protocol, which 
realises the analogue of a repeater in classical communication. 
8.6.1 Introduction 
This section continues and generalises the discussion of Sect. 6.2. There, a 
realisation of a quantum network [278] was proposed, using long-lived states 
of atoms as the physical basis for storing qubits, and photons as a means for 
transferring these qubits from one atom to another. To allow for a controlled 
transfer of the qubit, the atoms are embedded in high finesse optical cavities 
which are connected by an optical fibre, as shown in Fig. 6.1. 
The compound cavity-fibre system, together with the laser pulses consti-
tutes what we abstractly call a nmsy quantum channel, see Fig. 8.11. When 
the photons are sent along optical fibres, photon absorption will be a dom-
inant transfer error. Losses will also occur by incoherent scattering on the 
surface of the cavity mirrors and at the coupling segments between the cavi-
ties and the fibre. Another typical transfer error will be caused by imperfectly 
designed laser pulses for the Raman transition, and an example for a local 
gate error is spontaneous emission in one of the atoms during the gate oper-
ation. 
This section shows how high fidelity communication is possible even in 
the presence of errors due to dissipation and noise, and how one can combat

8. Entanglement Purification 
the effects of decoherence. First, we will briefly summarise the arguments 
of Sect. 6.2, which gives us the opportunity to introduce a notation that is 
adapted to the language of error correction and quantum information theory. 
In Sect. 8.6.3 and 8.6.4 we then concentrate on transmission errors that occur 
during the photon transfer and show how they can be detected and corrected 
[393]-[395]. For this discussion we assume that local gate operations and 
measurements can be performed without errors. In Sect. 8.7, we relax this 
assumption and allow all operations, both local and in the transmission, to 
be imperfect. This reflects the general situation when we have used all means 
of error correction but cannot exclude the possibility that some errors have 
escaped our detection and have thus not been corrected, or that the opera-
tions and measurements we use are, in some sense, imprecise. In this general 
context, we study the important problem of 'long-distance' communication 
and the use of quantum repeaters [381, 387]. 
From a formal perspective it is advantageous to rephrase quantum com-
munication as the problem of creating distant quantum correlations over a 
channel, instead of directly propagating an unknown qubit through the chan-
nel. Once an EPR pair is created, it can be employed for teleportation [74], 
that is real transmission of information, but also for other purposes such as 
secret key distribution for quantum cryptography [46]. It is worth pointing 
out that this approach is different from quantum computation in the sense 
that, until the full EPR is established, there is no genuine information being 
processed. All one does is to build up nonlocal quantum correlations which 
may later be used for transmission purposes. In fact, at that later time, the 
connecting channel need not even exist any more. 
The subject of this chapter is therefore how to create an EPR pair between 
two parties A and B with the aid of a noisy quantum channel of arbitrary 
length I that connects A and B. 
8.6.2 Ideal Communication 
Ideally, the scheme in Sect. 6.2 realises the following transmission 
(8.37) 
where an unknown superposition of internal states 10) = Ie) and 11) = Ig) in 
atom A in the first cavity is transferred to atom B in the second cavity, see 
again Fig. 8.12. The cavities may be part of a larger network, so we often refer 
to them as node A and node B, respectively. The selected internal states 10) 
and 11) of the atoms define, in the language of quantum information theory, 
the 'computational basis' for the qubit. 
It is important to realise that the atom A may be entangled to other 
atoms in the same cavity or at other nodes of the network. In that situation, 
the coefficients Go and (3 in (8.37) are no longer complex numbers but denote 
unnormalised states of the other atoms. Thus the transmission (8.37) can be

Node A 
NodeB 
Fig. 8.12. Swapping the state of an atom from node A to node B. When the atom 
at A is in state 11)A, a sequence of Raman transitions as described in Sect. 6.2 can 
be used to swap its state onto the atom located at node B via photonic transfer. 
When atom A is in state 10)A, the Raman pulse does not change the state. A 
superposition of states 10) A and 11) A is thereby transferred to node B according to 
(8.38). 
used to transfer single atomic states, but also to transfer entanglement. For 
instance, starting from single particle states, an EPR pair can be created by 
a two-step process 
[aIO)A + ;311)A]IO)A210)B ----t [aIO)A210)A + ;3!1)A211)A]IO)B 
----t IO)A2 [aIO)AIO)B + ;31 1)All)B]. 
(8.38) 
Here, the first arrow refers to a local CNOT operation between two atoms 
A and A2 in the first cavity. The second arrow transfers the state of A2 
to B, thereby transferring the entanglement between the atoms A and A2 
to an entanglement between atoms A and B. At the end of this composite 
transformation, the state of the auxiliary atom A2 is the same as initially 
and factors out. For a = ;3, an ideal EPR pair is created. 
8.6.3 Correction of Transfer Errors: 
The Photonic Channel 
In a realistic model, we have to consider the possibility that the transfer of the 
atomic state from cavity A to B is imperfect. There is a certain probability 
that the atom in B will not be excited, even though A was excited. This is 
due to the interaction of the compound atom-cavity-fibre system with the 
environment which, even if small, in principle always exists. This results in 
an entanglement of the atomic states in (8.37) with the environment, i.e. the 
cavity walls, the fibre, and the radiation field of the free space. 
In the following, we assume that photons can be absorbed but not created 
by the channel. This is a very good approximation for optical photons, where 

284 
8. Entanglement Purification 
the mean thermal number of photons in the cavities and the fibre is exceed-
ingly small. In this situation, the most general expression for an imperfect 
transfer operation is of the form 
10)AIO)BIE) ------t 10)AI0)BIEo) 
11)AI0)BIE) ------t 10)AI1)BIEI ) + 10)AI0)BIEa) , 
(8.39) 
where IE), lEo), ... denote unnormalised states of the environment. It is expe-
dient to write lEo) = TolE), lEI) = 7iIE), lEa) = TalE), thereby introducing 
operators that entangle the system with the environment. With this notation, 
(8.39) can be expressed in the compact form8 
10) A 10) B ------t 10) A 10) B To 
11)AI0)B ------t 10)AI1)B7i + 10)AI0)BTa, 
(8.40) 
which defines the photonic channel [394]. 
The optical cavities together with the fibre form a compound optical 
system with a certain resonant structure that defines its spectrum of quasi 
modes, its relaxation constants, etc. In the special case when only photon 
absorption plays a role, the operators in (8.40) have a simple form. For 
optical frequencies, the state of the environment can be very well approx-
imated by the vacuum state, so one can write To = 1, 7i = a(T) ~ e-I<T, 
Ta = I:J PJ(T)bJ, with I:J IPJ(T)1 2 ~ 1 ~ e- 2 1<T where K is the damping 
rate of the total (atom-) cavity-fibre system, and T is the transfer time. The 
operators bJ, bJ are amplitude operators of the j th oscillator mode of the 
environment. 
More generally, the operators To,I,a in (8.40) may describe spontaneous 
emission processes, photon absorption, as well as transitions to and repump-
ing from other internal states of the atoms. Thus, all complicated physics is 
hidden in the three operators. In this general (non-stationary) situation, the 
time dependence of the environmental terms has to be taken into account. 
The operators To,I,a then depend on the initial time when the transfer starts. 
As a consequence, when iterating the channel (8.40), the temporal ordering 
of the operators becomes important, e.g. 7i(tJ)To(to) =I To(t l )7i(tO). 
When using (8.40) to create an EPR pair as in (8.38), we obtain 
[aIO)A + pI1)A]10)B ------t [aIO)AIO)BTo + Pi1)AI1)B7i] 
+pI1)AI0)BTa . 
For a = p, this expression can be written in the formg 
(8.41) 
8 In expressions of this type, it is understood that both the left- and the right-
hand sides are applied to a given state of the environment. Using this compact 
notation keeps the expressions much more transparent when twofold or more 
complex applications of the channel are studied. 
9 Throughout this section, normalisation factors are omitted unless they are 
needed.

where we use the Bell basis 
The fidelity of the resulting pair (S.42) can be defined by its overlap with the 
ideal result 14>1B). This overlap is given by the norm 
(S.43) 
The estimate of F in the second term demonstrates how the coupling of the 
modes of the cavity-fibre system to the environment reduces the attainable 
fidelity of the EPR pair. In particular, F decreases exponentially with the 
transfer time and the corresponding length of the fibre. 
In order to create an EPR pair over a distance comparable to or larger 
than the absorption length of the photonic channel, we need to find a method 
to detect and correct a photon loss that may occur during t.he transfer. Loosely 
speaking, we are seeking to eliminate the absorption term Ta in (S.42), and 
to minimise the other term To ~ 7I. 
In the following, we outline a method that uses either one or two auxiliary 
atoms in each cavity. This outline just summarises the essential steps. For 
details, the reader should consult Refs. [393]-[395]. 
8.6.4 Purification with Finite Means 
The main idea is to entangle the atom in the first cavity with auxiliary 
(backup) atoms, before transmitting the information. This is reminiscent of 
a redundant coding scheme, with the fundamental difference that our scheme 
allows one to correct errors to all orders in the photo-absorption probability. 
By measuring a certain joint state of two atoms in the receiver cavity, one 
is able to detect a photon loss while maintaining the initial coherence of the 
atomic state that was sent. Therefore, the transmission can be repeated as 
often as necessary until no error is detected. 
In detail, this requires three steps: 
(1) Encoding of the atomic state into a three-particle entangled state 
aIO)A + ,Bll)A ----+ a[10)AI0)A 2 10)A 3 + Il)All)A2 11)A 3 ] 
+,B[10)AI0)A 2 11)A3 + Il)All)A2 10)A3 ]· 
(S.44) 
This can be realised by applying two CNOT operations between A3 and A, 
and A and A 2 , respectively. 
(2) Transmisswn of a photon twice by using (S.40) between atom A2 and B2 
and then between A2 and B, applying a local flip operation on A in between. 

286 
8. Entanglement Purification 
The result of this operation is a multi-particle entangled state [395] whose 
explicit form will not be given here. 
(3) Measuring the states of certain backup atoms in both cavities. Combined 
with appropriate local unitary transformations, one obtains one of two results. 
The effect of this procedure is summarised in the following absorption-free 
(i.e. correcting) channel 
[aIO)A + ;31 1)A]10)B --+ aIO)AIO)BSo + ;31 1)All)BSl 
er~ 
(8.45) 
Owing to the twofold transmission process, the operators S appearing in 
(8.45) are products of the T operators, e.g. So = Toli, Sl = liTo, or in 
different order. The important feature to notice is that, depending on the 
results of the measurement in step (3), two outcomes are possible: If an error 
is detected, the state is projected onto the second line of (8.45) and the 
transmission can be repeated; if no error is detected, the state is projected 
onto the first line of (8.45), which completes the channel. 
By using (8.45) instead of (8.40) one obtains 
[IO)A + II/A]IO)B --+ 10)AI0)BSo + Il)All)BSl 
= I<P~B)~ [So + Sl] + 1<P:4B)~ [So - Sl]' (8.46) 
For the simple example considered after (8.40), with To = 1 and Ii = 
e- KT , we have So = e- KT and Sl = e- KT , thus the second term in (8.46) 
vanishes. In this situation, an ideal EPR pair is established after a szngle use 
of the channel (8.45). This corresponds to an average number of phototrans-
missions of e2KT • 
More generally, a similar result is obtained when the state of the en-
vironment does not depend on the temporal ordering of the operators To 
and Ii. Such a stationary environment is defined by li(h)To(to)IE) = 
To(td71(to)IE), i.e. SolE) = SlIE). For any system with a stationary en-
vironment, an ideal EPR pair is created by a single application of (8.45). 
For the discussion of the general, non-stationary case, let us first rewrite 
the result (8.46) in the form 
(8.47) 
where IE~)) = ~(So ± Sl)IE). The norm (square) of the environment IE~l)) 
determines the fidelity of the pair. 
At this point, the key advantage of the absorption-free channel (AFC) 
comes into play, namely that it corrects errors in the transmission process 
while maintaining the coherence and possible entanglement of the state it 
is applied to. This allows an iterative purification protocol [394]. At each 
purification step, the pair is temporarily entangled with two auxiliary atoms,

Fig. 8.13. Purification of an EPR pair with finite means. (a) Iterative purification 
protocol. At each purification step, an EPR pair of the form (8.48) with fidelity 
FN is temporarily entangled with two auxiliary atoms. This involves two CNOT 
operations, the absorption-free channel AFC, and measurements M. Furthermore, 
there are some Hadamard transformations that are not shown in the figure. The 
value of the new fidelity F N+ l depends on the result of the measurements M, as 
explained in (b). Note that this scheme operates on the same set of atoms at each 
step, thereby realising a 'self-purification process'. (b) One-sided random-walk pro-
cess for fidelity. After each iteration step in (a), the fidelity FN increases (decreases) 
with a certain probability Pup (Pdown ) that depends on N. If FN happens to drop 
below the initial value Fo, we reset the pair to this value by a single use of the AFC, 
as in (8.46). This is equivalent to a one-sided random walk process with reflections 
at a lower barrier at Fo, as indicated in the figure. On average, the fidelity t hereby

one at each node, using both local CNOT operations and the AFC. In some 
sense, this creates an auxiliary EPR pair that is used to purify (S.47) . The 
detailed protocol is shown systematically in Fig. S.13a. 
This protocol transforms (S.47) into a sequence of states of the form 
(S.4S) 
where either

depending on the result of the measurement. In the first case, which hap-
pens with probability Pup = pJ:) , the fidelity of the pair increases. In the 
second case, which happens with Pdown = 1 - Pup, the fidelity decreases. 
One can show that this creates a stochastic process corresponding to a one-
sided random-walk process as depicted in Fig. 8.13b. On average, the fidelity 
FN = (E~N)IE~N») thereby converges towards unity exponentially fast with 
the number of purification steps. 
8.7 Quantum Repeaters 
With the methods discussed in the previous sections, it is possible to create 
an EPR pair of high fidelity by sending single photons through a dissipative 
and noisy channel that connects the atoms. There is, however, a limitation to 
the method when the transmission time through the channel becomes much 
larger than its relaxation time, i.e. if liT » 1. As the absorption probability 
grows exponentially with T, so will the required number of repetitions for one 
successful transmission. 
Absorption losses are well-known in problems of electric signal transmis-
sion through classical channels where, at regularly spaced intervals, repeaters 
are put in the channel. In classical (digital) communication technique such 
repeaters are used to both amplify and to restore the signal. The distance 
between the repeaters is then determined by the damping rate of the fibre 
and the bit rate of the transmission (dispersion effects). 
For quantum communication, we cannot use amplifiers. To build up EPR 
correlations, single qubits (photons) need to be transmitted and these cannot 
be amplified [88, 396] without destroying the quantum correlations. All we 
can do here is to detect whether a photon has been absorbed and, whenever 
that is the case, repeat the transmission. 
For the following discussion, let us assume that the dominant transmis-
sion error is given by photon absorption, and that the environment is sta-
tionary. This corresponds to a photonic channel (8.40) with To = 1 and 
Ti = e- KT = e- I/ 2Io where lo = c/21i defines the half length of the fibre. The 
probability for a successful transmission of a qubit from A to B, as indicated 
in Fig. 8.14(top), is then p(l) = e-l / lo where l is the length of the fibre. 
Correspondingly, the average number of required repetitions is 
1 
n(l) = -
= el / lo . 
p(l) 
(8.49) 
It is clear that this leads to unrealisticly high numbers for any experiment, 
if the fibre is much longer than a few half lengths lo. 
Guided by the idea of repeaters in classical communication, we divide 
the channel into a certain number N of segments, with connection points 
(nodes) in between, at which it is measured whether a transmission error

Fig. 8.14. Simple and compound fibre for transmission of single qubits from A

errors are measured. 
has occurred (see Fig. 8.14(bottom)). This can be done e.g. with the method 
explained in Sect. 5.2 by using a few extra ions in a cavity. If an absorption 
error is detected, the transmission across that segment is repeated. Then a 
photon is sent through the subsequent segment, and so on. Thereby, ideally, 
the state of the atom at A can be swapped from one connection point to 
the next, until one reaches atom B. The average total number of repetitions 
on each segment is n(IIN) = ellloN. Correspondingly, the total number of 
transmissions required for successfully sending the qubit across the compound 
fibre is 
_~_ IINlo 
ncom -
p(IIN) - Ne 
. 
(8.50) 
This is to be compared with (8.49). The compound fibre is thus preferable 
to the simple fibre if 
(8.51 ) 
The optimum number of segments is given by the value of N that minimises 
the left-hand side of above equation, which is Nmin = 1/10 . The minimum 
number of transmissions along the compound fibre is thus given by (8.50) 
with N = N min , that is 
n

(8.52) 
This situation is realised when the connection points are placed along the 
fibre with a spacing corresponding to the half length 10 , 
Up to this point we have assumed that local operations can be performed 
without errors. There are, in fact, schemes [397] which allow error detection 
and correction for local 2-bit operations. However, even with these methods, 
there is the possibility of errors that escape detection, since the detection 
mechanism itself uses I-bit operations and measurements which may not be 
perfect. This has two effects: (i) the local operations at every checkpoint in

Fig. 8.14(bottom) will introduce some noise into the transmission process; (ii) 
the fidelity of transmission across every segment is already limited to some 
maximum value Fmax. This can be seen from the fact that both the absorp-
tion free channel (8.45) and the purification protocol of Fig. 8.13a involve 
local operations that introduce some noise and thereby limit the maximum 
attainable fidelity. Both effects accumulate (exponentially) with the number 
of checkpoints and eventually spoil the fidelity of the transmission completely. 
To make this point clearer, we consider the following equivalent problem. 
We first create N elementary EPR pairs of fidelity Fl < Fmax between the 
nodes A &C1 , C1 & C2 , ... CN~l&B, as in Fig. 8.15. We then connect these 
pairs by making Bell measurements at the nodes C, and classically commu-
nicating the results between the nodes as in the schemes for teleportation 
[74] and entanglement swapping [74, 398]. This will result in a single EPR 
pair shared between the endpoints A and B in Fig. 8.15. Unfortunately, with 
every connection the fidelity of the resulting pair will decrease, since the 
connection process involves imperfect operations that introduce noise. Fur-
thermore, even for perfect connections, the fidelity decreases: Connecting e.g. 
two Werner states of fidelity Fl by a Bell measurement, one obtains a new 
Werner state of fidelity 
1 { 
(4F -1)2} 
F2 = 4 1 + 3 -3-
, 
(8.53) 
so that F2 '" F12 for Fl '" 1. Both effects accumulate with every connection 
and lead to an exponential decrease of the fidelity FN with N of the final pair 
shared between A & B. Eventually, the value of FN drops below a certain 
threshold value Fmin 2': 1/2 below which it cannot be purified any more. That 
means, it will not be possible to increase the fidelity by purification [47,49]. 
By dividing the channel into shorter segments, it seems, we have thus 
eliminated the effect of an exponentially increasing number of required trans-
missions, at the cost of introducing an exponentially decreasing fidelity! 
A possibility to circumvent this limitation is to connect a smaller number 
L « N of pairs so that F£ > Fmin and purification becomes possible. The 
idea is to connect the resulting pairs, purify again, and continue in the same 
vein. The way in which such alternating sequences of connections and purifi-
cations is done has to be properly designed so that the number of required 
resources does not grow exponentially with N and thus with l. 
In the remainder of this section we describe a nested purificatwn protocol 
[381] which consists of connecting and purifying the pairs simultaneously in

the following sense (see Fig. 8.16). For simplicity, assume that N = L n for 
some integer n. On the first level, we simultaneously connect the pairs (initial 
fidelity Fd at all the connection points except at CL,C2L •... ,CN - L. As a 
result, we have N / L pairs of length L (and fidelity FL) between A & CL, CL 
& C2L and so on. To purify these pairs, we need a certain number M of copies 
that we construct in parallel fashion. For keeping track of the resources, it is 
convenient to arrange them in form of an array of elementary pairs as is done 
in Fig. 8.16 for L = 3 and M = 4. We then use these copies on the segments 
A & CL, CL & C2L etc., to purify and (re-)obtain one pair of fidelity Fl on 
each segment. This last condition determines the (average) number of copies 
M that we need, which will depend on the initial fidelity, the degradation of 
the fidelity under connections, and the efficiency of the purification protocol. 
The total number of elementary pairs we used up to this point is LM. [In 
Fig. 8.16, this means that each group of Lx M = 3 x 4 pairs has now been 
replaced by one single pair of the initial fidelity.] On the second level, we 
connect L of these larger pairs at every connection point CkL (k = 1,2 ... ) 
except at C£2, C2L 2, ••• ,CN - L2. As a result, we have N/L 2 pairs of length 
L2 between A & C L 2, C£2 & C2L2, and so on of fidelity FL. Again, we need 
M parallel copies of these long pairs to repurify up to a fidelity ::::: Fl. The 
total number of elementary pairs involved up to this point is (LM)2. [Now, 
the whole array of 32 x 42 pairs in Fig. 8.16 has been replaced by a single pair 
of fidelity Fl'] We iterate the procedure to higher and higher levels, until we 
reach the n-th level. As a result, we have obtained a final pair between A & 
B of length N and fidelity Fl. In this way, the total number R of elementary 
pairs will be (LM)n, where Mn alone gives the number of required 'parallel 
channels' in Fig. 8.16. We can re-express this result in the form 
(8.54) 
which shows that the resources grow polynomzally with the distance N.

8. Entanglement Purification 
The idea of nested purification is related to the idea of concatenated 
coding [399] which has been used in the context of fault-tolerant quantum 
computing [400]. That scheme allows one, in principle, to transmit a qubit 
over arbitrarily long distances with a polynomial overhead in the resources. 
It requires one, however, to encode a single qubit into an entangled state of 
a large number of qubits which is sent through the channel, and to operate 
on this code repeatedly during the transmission process. In contrast, in the 
nested purification scheme, we are not sending an arbitrary qubit through the 
channel, but creating EPR correlations across the whole channel simultane-
ously. While creating the correlations, there is no real quantum information 
being processed (although the EPR pair may subsequently be used for com-
munication via teleportation). As a result, we obtain fidelity requirements 
on the local operations which are in the few-percent region. In the case of 
fault-tolerant quantum computing, this number is of the order of 10-5 [399]. 
The array in Fig. 8.16 represents an ensemble of identical (elementary) 
EPR pairs with which the purification is performed. Alternatively, one can 
do the purification with the aid of a single auxiliary pair at each level (see 
[381, 387]). In a sense, the vertical dimension of the diagram in Fig. 8.16 
is thereby translated into a temporal axis (number of repetitions). In this 
case, it is the total time needed to create the EPR pair between A and 
B that scales polynomially in (8.54), whereas the number of backup atoms 
needed at each connection point grows only logarithmically with N = 1/10 . 
The resulting scheme of a quantum repeater is illustrated schematically in 
Fig. 8.17. Every connection point in the channel consists of a simple "quantum 
processor" that stores a small number of atoms on which it performs the gate 
operations and measurements required for purification. Some of the atoms 
are used to repeatedly build up EPR pairs between neighbouring connection

Fig. 8.17. Scheme for the quantum repeater. At every connection point, a small 
"quantum processor" (consisting of a few qubits only) is used to execute the proto-
cols of entanglement purification and entanglement swapping. The distribution of 
high-fidelity entanglement across the compound channel is then coordinated by a 
global protocol called nested entanglement purification [381 J. 

8.7 Quantum Repeaters 
293 
points (here L=2), for example by using the methods described in Sect. 8.6. 
These repeatedly created pairs are used for entanglement purification. More 
distant pairs are then created by entanglement swapping. To (re-) purify these 
more distant pairs, one auxiliary atom is needed for storage at each level. The 
total number that each processor has to store, thus grows only logarithmically 
with 1 [381,387]. 
In contrast to the case in classical communication, the quantum repeater 
is not a local amplifier, but it involves both the local checkpoints and global 
(nested) purification protocol. We have just reported here that our scheme 
tolerates errors for local operations and measurements that are in the percent 
region. For more details, the reader should consult Refs. [381, 387].
