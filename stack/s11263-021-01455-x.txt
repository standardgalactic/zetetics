As the field of computer vision is growing and maturing, 
performance evaluation has become essential. Most sub-
areas of computer vision now have established datasets and 
benchmarks allowing quantitative evaluation and compari-
son of current methods. In addition, new benchmarks often 
stimulate research into the particular challenges presented 
by the data. Conversely, important areas lacking high-quality 
datasets and benchmarks might not receive adequate atten-
tion by researchers.
The deep learning revolution has made datasets and per-
formance evaluation even more important. Learning-based 
methods not only require large, well-designed training data-
sets but also well-defined loss functions, which are usually 
designed to optimize established performance measures. 
This creates an implicit bias based on the availability of 
datasets and the definition of performance metrics.
In this special issue we sought all types of contributions 
broadly relating to performance evaluation in computer 
vision, including:
•	 Manuscripts introducing new performance evaluations 
or benchmarks, in particular in areas where quantitative 
evaluation is challenging or subjective
•	 Manuscripts surveying, evaluating, or comparing existing 
benchmarks or datasets
•	 Manuscripts addressing pros and cons of performance 
evaluations and datasets, as well as recommendations for 
best practices
We received 38 initial submissions for this special issue. 
Of these, 30 were considered to be within the scope of the 
special issue and underwent a rigorous peer review process. 
Each paper received at least 3 reviews, for a total of 148 
reviews by experts in the field—we greatly thank all of them 
for their effort! In the end, we accepted 18 papers for pub-
lication, all of which went through at least one round of 
revisions.
The accepted papers span the following topics: datasets, 
benchmarks and evaluations, robustness, novel metrics, and 
bias in datasets.
Several papers introduce new benchmarks for various 
domains, including wide-baseline matching (Jin et al. 2021), 
non-rigid structure from motion (Jensen et al. 2021), single-
object tracking (Fan et al. 2021), multi-object tracking (Den-
dorfer et al. 2021), deraining (Li et al. 2021), and inpainting 
of censored images (Black et al. 2021).
Other papers contribute novel datasets for action recogni-
tion (Weinzaepfel and Rogez 2021) and anomaly detection 
(Bergmann et al. 2021), as well as a technique for improved 
reference pose generation for the benchmarking of visual 
localization methods (Zhang et al. 2021).
Two papers address the evaluation of robustness (Kamann 
and Rother 2021; Shekar et al. 2021).

Several papers contribute novel metrics and taxonomies 
for the evaluation of different tasks, including multi-object 
tracking (Luiten et al. 2021), semantic segmentation (Yan 
et al. 2021), visual place recognition (Zaffar et al. 2021), 
image quality assessment (Ding et al. 2021), conditional 
image generation (Benny et al. 2021), and embodied explo-
ration (Ramakrishnan et al. 2021).
Finally, one paper addresses the problem of bias in facial 
datasets (Georgopoulos et al. 2021).
We thank all authors for their contribution to this special 
issue. We hope that the datasets, benchmarks, and metrics 
developed by the accepted papers as well as the general 
methodologies for creating benchmarks will be of value to 
the community.
