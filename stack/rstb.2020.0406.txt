Lewontin’s 1972 article ‘The apportionment of human diversity’ described a
key feature of human genetic diversity that would have profound impacts on
conversations regarding genetics and race: the typical genetic locus varies
much less between classical human race groupings than one might infer
from inspecting the features historically used to define those races, like skin
pigmentation. From this, Lewontin concluded: ‘Human racial classification
… is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance’
(p. 397). Here, 50 years after the paper’s publication, the goal is to understand
the origins and legacy of the paper. Aided by insights from published papers
and interviews with several of Lewontin’s contemporaries, I review the 1972
paper, asking about the intellectual background that led to the publication of
the paper, the development of its impact, the critiques of the work and the
work’s application and limitations today. The hope is that by gaining a clearer
understanding of the origin and reasoning of the paper, we might dispel var-
ious confusions about the result and sharpen an understanding of the
enduring value and insight the result provides.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Celebrating 50 years since
Lewontin’s apportionment of human diversity’.
1. Introduction
And so I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got enough of this data, let’s see what it tells us about
the differences between human groups’. And so I just looked into the literature, and
that literature was in books and so on.
[O]ne day I was going to give a lecture, I think it was in Carbondale, Illinois, or some-
where south. I was working in Chicago at the time. So I took a couple of these books
with me and a pad of paper, and a table of logarithms which I needed for this pur-
pose, and a little hand calculator, and I sat on this bus trip for three or four hours
looking at the books, picking out the data, looking it up in the table of logarithms,
doing a calculation, and writing it down in tables. And when I got back after the
round trip I had all the data I needed to write the paper about how much human gen-
etic variation there was, and so I did it. […]

time on a bus to work. – R.C. Lewontin, Interview for ‘Race the Power of an Illusion’
Documentary [1]
With this story, Lewontin describes the origins of his paper on ‘The apportion-
ment of human diversity’ [2], a paper that would go on to have profound
impacts on perceptions of human genetics and race, with key phrases from
the paper echoing for decades across disciplines to the present day.
As is well known, the paper showed that at a typical genetic locus 85% of
‘[genetic variation is found within human groups]’ and on that basis he con-
cluded that ‘human races and populations are remarkably similar to each
other with the largest part by far of human variation being accounted for by
the differences between individuals’ and from this he judged that ‘Human
racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic

significance’. The paper’s main result is routinely cited in
antiracist perspectives on race and genetics and has been fea-
tured in some of the most widely distributed public
translations of genetic results (e.g. [1,3]).
Here, 50 years after the paper’s publication, the goal is to
understand its origins and legacy, including the nature of the
critiques and concerns with it, and ultimately what power
and limitations it has in discussions about genetics and
race. Aided by insights from published papers and inter-
views
with
several
of
Lewontin’s
contemporaries
(see
Acknowledgements), I review the 1972 paper, asking about
the intellectual background that led to the publication of
the paper, the development of its impact, the critiques of
the work and its enduring relevance. This review also
benefits greatly from insights provided by other perspectives
on Lewontin’s 1972 [2] paper (e.g. [4–6]), including an edited
volume on the papers of Anthony Edwards [7], which con-
tains an excellent interview with Edwards and an especially
lucid commentary by Noah Rosenberg [8].
The next section of this review, ‘Background’, situates
Lewontin’s work in terms of a complex set of antecedents,
including his now little-known work on the textbook Quanti-
tative Zoology [9], as well as an interest in information theory
and debates in evolutionary genetics at the time. The hope is
that by understanding the foundations of the work, we might
gain a deeper understanding of the reasoning of the paper,
and in turn more clearly navigate the subsequent critiques.
The third section, ‘The results and reactions’, discusses
how his key result was both supported and contested by sub-
sequent publications. Many of the critiques criticized a
conclusion that Lewontin did not in fact draw; the apparent
critique by Edwards [10] in particular considers a different
aspect of the taxonomy problem from the one Lewontin
aimed for and does not invalidate the central insight pro-
vided by Lewontin’s result. We will see how much of the
apparent controversy here was due to a confusion about the
focal question. For Lewontin, the question was not whether
genetics can be used for studying relationships among indi-
viduals (i.e. whether genetics can be a basis of taxonomy);
he was asking rather whether human racial groupings have
taxonomic significance in the sense that they are predictive
of meaningful differentiation at a typical genetic locus.
The fourth section, ‘Lasting legacy’, considers how the
Apportionment’s key result became a sound bite, so well-
used that it is at times applied in vague and mistaken ways
even by its advocates, a slippage that likely invited some of
the later critiques. Despite its importance, Lewontin under-
stood that the result does not provide a single answer to all
arguments about genetics and race. Yet, in showing how
human genetic differentiation is much lower than one
would suppose from looking at surface indicators like skin
pigmentation, the result endures as a key fact about human
genetic variation that reaffirms that nothing about human
genetic diversity is as simple as it first appears. Finally, box
2 on ‘Teaching the result’ gives some insights and references
on some approaches to teaching the result.
2. Background
(a) In the spirit of Quantitative Zoology?
Lewontin’s paper was developed at a time when many gen-
eticists found themselves being called upon to react to the
controversial writings on genetics and race by Arthur
Jensen in 1969 [30]. Lewontin himself had written a critical
response in the Bulletin of Atomic Science already in 1970
[31] and later wrote similarly motivated pieces, for example,
in Science in 1975 with Marcus Feldman [32], in the American
Journal of Human Genetics in 1974 reacting to works by
Morton and colleagues [33], and much later in 1984 in Not
In Our Genes [34]. Though the Jensen controversy was likely
among the motivating factors, the 1972 paper does not con-
tain any reference to it.
The paper appears in the 6th volume of a series titled
Evolutionary
Biology for which
Theodosius Dobzhansky
(Lewontin’s PhD advisor), Max Hecht and William Steere
were editors. The volume appears to have been organized,
at least in part, to honour famed paleontologist George Gay-
lord Simpson’s 70th birthday. The opening piece is a tribute
to Simpson [35], and many of the articles, though not all,
begin with tributes to him, including Dobzhansky’s contri-
bution
to
the
volume
[36].
The
volume
also
has
a
concentration of papers on human variation and evolution:
the final five papers in the volume are focused on the subject,
including a contribution by Dobzhansky, who possibly
invited Lewontin to submit to the volume. One of those
five human-oriented papers was titled ‘Polygenic inheritance
and human intelligence’ [37], though its author, Michael
Lerner, tried explicitly not to discuss the ongoing controver-
sies about human genetics and race. Dobzhansky himself
had long been steeped in discussion about the taxonomic
value of the race classification, defending a concept of race
in biology and its applicability to humans [38].
Whether Dobzhansky and the other editors were seeking
a piece from Lewontin that might honour Simpson and/or
address genetics and race in humans is unclear. Lewontin
and Simpson likely interacted when they were both at
Columbia in the early 1950s, and while relatively unknown
today, Lewontin had a substantial collaboration with Simp-
son. In 1960, Simpson
and Lewontin co-authored the
second edition of the textbook Quantitative Zoology, along
with Simpson’s wife Anne Roe [9].
First published in 1939, the book teaches a rigorous,
numerical approach to questions in biology, including taxon-
omy. Lewontin was added as an author for the 1960 edition
due to his expertise in biometrics, a field that had blossomed
since the original publication of Quantitative Zoology. The new
edition added a chapter on the analysis of variance (‘This
must now be considered an essential and basic technique in
Quantitative Zoology’ p. vi), which Lewontin most likely
wrote given the style and themes that it emphasizes.
As an application of the analysis of variance, the chapter
describes how ‘a problem common in experimental taxon-
omy is that of distinguishing geographical races’ (p.304).
Though it is not explicit about defining criteria for races, it
presents an example from Drosophila persimilis from three
geographical localities in western North America. Unlike
what he would later find for human groups, the genetic var-
iance in bristle number across localities was estimated to be
about 4-fold larger than that between individuals. As the
chapter explains ‘The reasonable conclusion from the analysis
is that the populations […] are genetically different and con-
stitute distinct geographical races (under one commonly
accepted criterion of race).’ (p.304)
Though differing in detail (using indirect estimates of
genetic variance in an example trait versus direct observation

of genotypic data) and imprecise in defining a criterion for
race, the approach foreshadows Lewontin’s work on human
genetic diversity in the 1972 Apportionment paper. Both
works apportion variances to make evaluative statements
about taxonomic categories. The working logic is that a
meaningful taxonomic assignment (e.g. of individuals into
races) is one where a large amount of variance between
groups exists relative to the variance within.
Another relevant passage that is worth revisiting as back-
ground to the 1972 [2] paper, comes from the chapter on the
‘Comparison of Samples’. In it, the classic distinction between
statistical significance and biological significance is made
(emphasis preserved from original text):
In the real world, no two populations of objects can have pre-
cisely
equal
means
or
standard
deviations.
A
difference
between two such populations can always be established, pro-
vided the observer is willing to go to enough trouble to refine
and increase the number of his measurements. (p.173, [9])
And it continues:
One always knows long before he starts that both the samples
which he measures and the populations from which they are
drawn are different to some greater or lesser extent in the value
of every parameter that can be imagined. It is therefore essential
that some degree of difference be assumed to be trivial and not
germane to the problem. (p.173, [9])
Applied to genetics and put in the context of his 1972 paper
on humans, the question is not whether differences in allele
frequencies between named races exist—it is rather whether
the differences between groups are meaningful or, as he
describes in the passage, can be ‘assumed to be trivial and
not germane to the problem’. As we will see, the apportion-
ment of diversity would be Lewontin’s numerical tool for
addressing this question.
(b) Evolutionary motivations?
Whether prompted by the volume dedicated to Simpson or
not, Lewontin did not explicitly acknowledge any link in
his 1972 paper. Lewontin’s introduction to the paper and
later interviews would suggest that the motivations were
larger than the volume, and that any framing in terms of
Simpson did not bear heavily on his mind. Lewontin intro-
duced the paper in the context of major questions in
evolutionary genetics from the time, and the challenge of
how to measure variation between populations.
The late 1960s and early 1970s were a dynamic time for
evolutionary genetics, when major schools of thought were
being challenged by new tools for the measurement of gen-
etic
variation
(namely
gel
electrophoresis)
that
were
revealing an abundance of molecular variation. In one
major school of thought, the ‘Classical’ school of H.J.
Muller and colleagues, most genetic variation is deleterious
and rare; in contrast, for the ‘Balancing’ school, associated
with Dobzhansky and colleagues, genetic variation is abun-
dant
and
maintained
by
selective
forces,
such
as
heterozygote advantage or temporally varying selective
pressures [33,39]. These schools of thought were to be up-
ended shortly by a new school that supposed that most mol-
ecular variations were neutral with respect to fitness (a
hypothesis first raised by Lewontin in [40], p.605).
In the 1972 paper, Lewontin motivated the apportionment
of diversity among races in light of these Classical and Balan-
cing schools. For the Classical school, any differences
between biological races must be a major component of the
total variation in a species; while for the Balancing school,
variation between races would be expected to be a small com-
ponent
of
variation.
For
Lewontin,
understanding
the
apportionment of variation in humans, or any species for
that matter, had a relationship to the broadest questions of
evolutionary genetics. The 1972 paper would not be remem-
bered for those reasons, though. Even in the paper itself,
Lewontin does not return to the broader evolutionary fram-
ing when discussing the implications of his result.
Lewontin also set the stage for his paper by pointing out
what he saw as an epistemological problem to assessing how
much variation lies between groups. If the same characters
used for grouping individuals are used for assessing the par-
titioning of variances (e.g. skin pigmentation in the case of
human races), then the magnitude of between-group vari-
ation will necessarily be over-estimated.
Thankfully for Lewontin’s purposes, in the lead up to his
paper, ever-broadening surveys of genetic variation in human
groups were taking place (e.g. [41–45]). These direct obser-
vations of genetic variation were beginning to be analysed
with a growing suite of numerical approaches, including
population clustering and phylogenetic analysis techniques
[46–48], and had the exciting promise of overcoming the per-
ceptual biases that would otherwise plague apportionments
of diversity in humans.
In Lewontin’s words, molecular data could ‘put the com-
parative differentiation within and between groups on a firm
quantitative basis [2, p. 383].’ This emphasis on a technologi-
cal opportunity dovetails best with how he would later
describe the setting for the work. For instance, as quoted
above from a 2003 interview [1], Lewontin set up his 1972
paper by describing how the accumulating datasets were
key to spurring his work on the problem. Lewontin appreci-
ated that the time was ripe for carrying out a quantitative
analysis of the taxonomic groupings of humans into races.
(c) The information theory content in classification?
A methodological curiosity of the 1972 paper is that although
he was well versed in analysis of variance (as described
above) and having titled the paper the ‘apportionment of
human diversity’, Lewontin did not use a traditional analysis
of variance nor the already well-known alternative based on
Sewall Wright’s heterozygosity-based measures [49]. Instead,
he used an approach based on Shannon’s information theory
[50]. Information theory was popular at the time across
numerous disciplines and Lewontin reportedly took interest
in it. The information-theoretic approach yields nearly identi-
cal results to using heterozygosities (as well as to using later
versions of the analysis of variance modified for genetic
data), but as many authors have noted, the information-the-
oretic approach is non-standard and more difficult to
interpret in standard genetic terms [51–53].
Whether convenience played a role is amusing to con-
sider—perhaps
computing
logarithms
via
tables
was
simpler at the time than the quadratic forms needed for com-
puting heterozygosities, especially if the calculations truly
took place mostly on a bus ride. In his rationale, Lewontin
hints that the reasoning was more profound: ‘[Shannon’s
information measure, H] is widely used to characterize
species diversity in community ecology, and since I am per-
forming a kind of taxonomic analysis here, I will use H’
[2, p. 388].

With regard to his goals with the paper, in carrying out ‘a
kind of taxonomic analysis’ with measures of information
theory, his analysis considered how much information there
is among individuals within populations relative to the
whole (that is the average proportion of diversity within
populations was calculated as Hpop=Hspecies). If that pro-
portion is large, one might conclude that the difference
between races is small.
Another way of conceiving the question in terms of infor-
mation content is to ask whether a taxonomic label has much
information about an individual’s alleles (see box 1)? Does
knowing two individuals’ race assignments give you much
information about their genetic differences? (Reference [54],
for example, verbally frames the question in these terms.)
The answer to these questions would seem useful for evalu-
ating the taxonomic value of the race designation, and
Lewontin’s investigation would shed light on these impor-
tant questions (box 2).
3. The result and reactions
(a) Arbitrary choices, yet an enduring result
To carry out his analysis, Lewontin used published data
[41,42,44,45] and had to make several decisions: which
human groups to include, how to arrange them into various
populations, and then how to organize the populations into
races. This is not a straightforward exercise, and Lewontin’s
text is frank regarding the challenge in a way that one
rarely reads today: ‘I have tried to include what would
appear to be a priori representative of the range of human
diversity. But how does one do that? […] How many differ-
ent European nationalities should be included as compared
with many African peoples or Indian tribes?’ (p.384). He
ends up choosing to use ‘as much as possible equal numbers
of African peoples, European nationalities, Oceanian popu-
lations, Asian peoples, and American Indian tribes’ (p.385)
weighing them equally, with the rationale that the equal
weighting should favour finding variation between groups
versus within them. With regards to the racial groupings,
‘the boundary line must be arbitrary’ (p.385) but ‘I have
chosen a conservative path and have used the classical
racial groupings with a few switches based on obvious total
genetic divergence. Thus the question I asked is ‘‘How
much of diversity between populations is accounted for by
more or less conventional racial classification?’’’ (p.386). To
that end, he uses what he calls ‘the usual four’ (i.e. ‘Cauca-
sians’, ‘Black Africans’, ‘Mongoloids’, ‘Amerinds’), as well
as ‘South Asian Aborigines’, ‘Oceanians’ and ‘Australian
Aborigines’.
With those designations he found his well-known results:
the average proportion of diversity within populations was
85.4% of the total, between populations within races was
8.3% of the total, and a final 6.3% was accounted for by diver-
sity between the race groups. Given the arbitrariness of how
to group populations into races, the 85.4% value is expected
to be the more robust than the 8.3% and 6.3% values. Later
results and re-calculations show that these numbers vary
depending on grouping decisions [6] as well as due to calcu-
lation errors [55]. Over time, the 85% number would be
replicated with some deviations (e.g. 80–95%) across a
number of studies using related approaches on similar data,
including by Nei and Roychoudhury that same year and by
others shortly after using similar data [51,56–60], and with
novel forms of data such as alleles at HLA loci ([56,61];
also see [62]).
Over time, yet more marker systems have shown similar
results, such as mitochondrial variation [63], RFLPs [64,65],
microsatellites
[64,66,67]
and
genome-wide
surveys
of
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
[68,69].
For
example, with microsatellites, Rosenberg et al. [67] found
the proportion within populations to be higher, at 93–95%.
Using large samples of bi-allelic SNP markers, Li et al. [69]
found a number slightly higher than Lewontin’s, with 89%
within populations. The biological and technical nuances
affecting the differences in these numbers have been dis-
cussed previously (for example by [6,70,71]). Some of the
differences may be due to Lewontin’s resolving of arbitrary
choices by choosing those that would favour observing
between-group variance; however, some of the differences
in results across studies may be due to the different loci
used. Despite these variations, the qualitative finding of
much higher variation within human populations relative
to the variation between populations or races has been
robust.
In a public talk at Berkeley years after his original publi-
cation [72], while describing how Barbujani’s [6] study found
84.5% within populations as opposed to Lewontin’s 85.4%,
Lewontin would quip that the results were ‘closer than any
scientist is entitled to expect’ and he joked that given the per-
mutation of the last two digits ‘[Barbujani] got the last two
numbers wrong’ ([72], ca 30:45). Barbujani told me how
when he conversed with Lewontin about his paper, Lewontin
was happy about the agreement they found on the roughly
85% within-population portion but was concerned about an
apparent discord regarding the between-race portioning, as
Barbujani’s number was twice that of Lewontin’s (12%
versus 6%). As Lewontin expressed in the same public talk,
the between-race amount comes down to ‘how you decide
who goes in what race’, and stressed the 85% variation as
being consistent and ‘pretty remarkable’. With the benefit
of hindsight, the results of Rosenberg et al. [66] suggest that
the similarity between Lewontin and Barbujani et al.’s ana-
lyses may have been in part be due to how Barbujani
et al.’s study has one factor in the study that magnifies differ-
entiation slightly (a curated population set with more isolated
populations) and another that reduces the differentiation (the
use of microsatellites).
Regardless, the implication of Lewontin’s ‘pretty remark-
able’ result was, as he stated in the conclusion of his 1972
paper, that ‘our perception of relative large differences
between races and subgroups, as compared to the variation
within these groups is a biased perception’. This conclusion
has also held up remarkably well in the age of genomics.
Human population geneticists now know much more about
the genetic basis of skin pigmentation, and have directly
observed how the large-effect genetic loci that underlie skin
pigmentation are systematically more differentiated than a
typical locus in the human genome [73–75]. In agreement
with this, Relethford estimated the apportionment of diver-
sity
for
skin
colour
as
a
trait,
finding
the
diversity
apportions with 91% of the variance between populations
[76]. In addition, models of human population history that
have been fit to genetic data overwhelmingly support that
the divergences among human groups are all relatively
recent in evolutionary terms and that gene flow across

seemingly distinct geographical regions has been common
[77–79]. That history helps explain why most of the variation
is found between individuals rather than between ‘races’: for
the typical locus in the human genome, there simply has not
been enough time for substantial differentiation between
groups to emerge, especially with gene flow acting as a hom-
ogenizing force.
The presence of genetic ancestry from archaic hominins,
such as Neandertals and Denisovans, slightly complicates
this picture, but given the relatively small fraction of the
genome inherited from archaics, the effect is arguably mini-
mal (see [80]). Thus, while Lewontin did not dwell on
historical mechanisms in his original paper, today there is a
much larger, coherent body of evidence and a set of detailed
historical population models that support the remarkable
observation he found.
(b) Dimensions of confusion
While the apportionment result has been enduring, Lewon-
tin’s final interpretations in the paper have had a more
complicated fate [2]. In his final paragraph, Lewontin stated
Box 1. Information-theoretic interpretation of Lewontin’s entropy
calculations.
Although Lewontin motivated the use of Shannon’s
information measure by noting its use in community
ecology, his approach has an information-theoretic
interpretation. Consider the problem of communicating
the alleles in a particular individual’s genotype to an
observer by using a digital message. How many bits
would be required to convey each allele, and could
the message be made substantially shorter if an individ-
ual’s population or race label is known?
From information theory, the average length needed
to convey a random variable’s value, assuming an opti-
mal encoding scheme, is the entropy of the random
variable. Lewontin computed the entropy at different
hierarchical levels, in each case computing a variant of
H ¼  P
i piln2pi, where the summation is over the
alleles at a locus and pi is allele frequency at the level of
analysis being considered (e.g. population, race, species).
This entropy conveys the average message length for
communicating one of the alleles in the genotype in an
encoding scheme that ignores any correlation among
alleles within and between loci. As an example, at a bi-
allelic locus, 1 bit would be required for an allele with fre-
quency 0.5. Because the species-level entropy value
(Hspecies) computed by Lewontin uses an allele frequency
averaged over all sampled populations, it can be under-
stood as the expected length to communicate an allele
without using any race or population label. Following
a similar logic, his entropies Hpop and Hrace can be under-
stood as expected lengths in coding schemes that
condition on knowing the individual’s population and
race labels, averaged over all populations/races (this
implicitly assumes that the individual is equally likely
to come from any of the populations or races). Lewon-
tin’s calculation of particular ratios of entropies helps
reveal
the
fractional
reduction
in
message
length
achieved by using different schemes.
His value for Hpop=Hspecies of 85.4% indicates that
having population labels would reduce the message
length
by
14.6%
on
average,
and
the
value
of
ðHspecies  HraceÞ=Hspecies of 6.3% indicates that having
race labels would reduce the message length by 6.3%
compared to using no labels. In information-theoretic
terms, the salient concept is conditional entropy, which
measures how much the message length decreases as
we provide more information to the receiver.
Box 2. Teaching the result.
Part of the legacy of any major scientific result is how it
is taught. The apportionment of diversity can at times
be difficult for students to grapple with—it is difficult
to think in terms of analysis of variance.
Thankfully, Lewontin’s work can be taught to stu-
dents in a number of ways because the apportionment
of diversity has relationships to many other concepts
in population genetics: the deficiency of heterozygotes
observed in a sample, the expected number of differ-
ences between pairs of sequences, the numbers of
shared versus private variants, and pairwise coalescent
times [8,11–14].
Different graphical representations of the result can
help. Donovan et al. display the result in terms of over-
lapping circles in a curriculum designed for high school
students (fig 1 in [15]). Mountain and Ramakrishnan
[16] plot pairwise differences between individuals
from within and between populations (also see [17]).
Rosenberg [13] has a number of different relevant and
interesting figures based on micro-satellite data. Finally,
many of the recent landmark papers on worldwide
human
population
genomics
have
useful
figures
within them (e.g. fig. 1A from [18]; fig. 2 from [19]).
My group also recently published an approach that
visualizes the geographic abundance patterns of var-
iants in the high-coverage 1000 Genomes dataset
[18,20] to help students understand how a ‘typical’ var-
iant is geographically distributed (Figures 1, 3, 4, [11];
also see [21]).
In my own teaching, I have developed an introduc-
tory population genetics workshop that uses real-world
data on the deficiency of heterozygotes relative to
Hardy-Weinberg proportions to teach about human
genetic structure and how skin pigmentation loci, such
as SLC24A5, are outliers relative to the typical locus
[22]. In lectures, to emphasize the point of Edwards
[10] and how information combines across many mar-
kers, I also enjoy showing Fig. 2 from Novembre &
Peter [23] as well as Fig. 6 from Patterson et al. [24]
and Fig. 2C from McVean [25].
Without question, more pedagogical research on the
impacts of how we teach about human genetic diversity
is needed. As an example, Donovan et al. [15,26] have
carried out preliminary studies to show how at least
some approaches can reduce racist attitudes among stu-
dents (also see [27–29]). More quantitative research on
pedagogical outcomes of genetics education of this
sort would be greatly beneficial.

how ‘human racial classification’ is ‘now seen to be of vir-
tually no genetic or taxonomic significance’, and as a result
‘no justification can be offered for its continuance’. His cri-
tique here is of an existing classification system that groups
human individuals by races (i.e. a categorization of individ-
uals; also see Shen & Feldman [81]; also see [54]). Keeping
in mind the background given above on the analysis of var-
iance, he is giving his conclusion that the quantitative
differences between races are small enough to not be biologi-
cally meaningful. In turn, race as a taxonomic label is not
very meaningful or useful as a predictor.
The specific words used here turn out to be important,
and Lewontin’s language here became a source of confusion
(again, see Shen & Feldman [81]). Many would think he was
saying that using genetics to assign people to genetic popu-
lations (a different type of classification from human racial
classification) is not possible at all. Among these, a critical
paper by Edwards in 2003 titled ‘Human genetic diversity:
Lewontin’s fallacy’ is the most well known, but it was not
the first such critique.
Foreshadowing Edwards, in 1976, Richard Spielman and
Smouse began their paper on the ‘Multivariate classification
of human populations’ [82] with a critical stance toward
Lewontin’s work: … it has been claimed that the variation
within each human population is so great that population distri-
butions
are more notable
for
their overlap
than for
their
distinctiveness. If this claim is justified, it follows that an individ-
ual cannot be confidently assigned to the correct population on the
basis of phenotype. This view of human diversity is a natural out-
growth of the examination of many different characters, taken one at
a time; single characters usually do show large overlap among
populations. A multivariate approach to the question might well
yield a different answer however, […] How reliably can an individ-
ual be placed in the correct population, if one makes use of all the
information available? Spielman and Smouse then went on to
show
how
a
multivariate/multi-locus
approach
allows
assignment of Amazonian individuals to villages or clusters
of villages better than random expectation.
In a similar spirit, Mitton [83] criticized Lewontin [2] as
well as Nei and Roychoudhury’s similar papers [59,60], see
above). He argued that one obtains a very different partition-
ing of variance when shifting from a single-locus to multi-
locus perspective. By looking at multiple loci jointly, Mitton
found a much greater partitioning of variance among popu-
lations. Mitton’s analysis motivated three separate critical
responses [84–86]. When Mitton replied to their critiques,
he held fast that a different perspective emerges from a
multi-locus approach [87], including a principal components
analysis of 92 population samples that showed three clear
clusters—labelled Oceanians, American Indians and Afri-
cans. The point being, as in Smouse and Spielman’s work,
that individual assignment to populations is possible using
multiple loci.
These same points first raised in the late 1970s would be
arrived at independently by Anthony Edwards in 2003, in his
impactful paper titled: ‘Human genetic diversity: Lewontin’s
fallacy’. Edwards argued that even with most of the variation
found within populations, genetics can be used for assign-
ment of individuals to genetic populations (a fact that had
just been shown empirically by [67]). Edwards developed
the point with an elegantly simple two-population math-
ematical model, and emphasized the information contained
in the joint distribution of all the observed loci. Scientifically,
his argument is similar to the points of Spielman and Smouse
and Mitton, but the presentation is more pithy and has
proven more impactful. Edwards was also the most polemi-
cal. He characterized Lewontin’s work as ‘an unjustified
assault on classification, which he deplored for social
reasons’.
With regards to the legacy of Lewontin’s result, one pas-
sage from Chakraborty’s response to Mitton is particularly
illuminating: ‘if it is possible to score the entire human
genome we would be able to infer that there is a vast
amount of genetic diversity even between individuals of
the same family. … To have a uniform unit for all evolution-
ary studies [a] ‘per cistron’ unit is probably more profitable.
[84, p. 1137]’ The phrasing ‘per cistron’ is antiquated but
means essentially ‘per locus’ in modern parlance (i.e. per a
given location in the genome). The passage highlights
how—whether apportioning diversity or doing classifi-
cation—a recurring challenge with these discussions is,
what aspect of genetic variation is one concerned with: a
single ‘typical’ locus, the entire human genome, or the var-
iants underlying a given phenotype? As we see, dimensions
of confusion emerged regarding (1) whether Lewontin was
arguing that classification (in the sense of assigning individ-
uals to populations) was possible or not, and (2) whether
his focus was on genetic variation at single loci or multiple
loci.
A remarkable aspect about the collection of critiques to
Lewontin is that they are tangential to Lewontin’s central
question. As introduced above in ‘Background’, Lewontin’s
focus is not on whether one can do classification, but on
what a racial classification conveys about genotype. Repeat-
edly in his writings and interviews, he conceded the
human ability to build classification systems using biological
traits like skin pigmentation, hair colour and stature that have
genetic components that vary across human groups substan-
tially: ‘No one would mistake a Chinese for a West African or
a Finn for an Australian aborigine’ [88, p.111]. The question is
whether such race groupings have taxonomic value in the
sense that they are predictive of meaningful differentiation at
a typical genetic locus. For instance, in his retelling of the
result in Human Diversity, after granting that loci with large
frequency differences between populations like Duffy Fy
exist, Lewontin stated, ‘The question is, are these large differ-
ences typical?’ [88, p.117]. The question was especially of
interest for Lewontin because of his concern that visible
traits may bias our perception of how much difference
exists at the typical genetic locus. With that concern, the
focus is naturally on how variation is apportioned per locus.
(c) Two sides of the same problem
The confusion about the key question does not invalidate the
points of Mitton, Smouse and Speilman and Edwards. They
were correct that with large numbers of loci, assignment to
groups is possible even if the groups are only subtly distin-
guished (i.e. classification using a genetically informed
taxonomy is possible). Even the most subtly differentiated
populations become detectably different with enough mar-
kers
and
individuals
sampled,
making
classification
possible (see [89] and references within, also [24]). For
example, Patterson et al. [24] derive an approximate relation-
ship between the number of observed markers, the number of
sampled individuals, the level of differentiation in terms and

the resultant ability to detect population structure. (These
facts resonate for me, given my own experiences detecting
subtle gradations of genetic structure in Europe using PCA
[23,90].)
The challenge is that two key facts can be true at the same
time: an apportionment of variance that implies the differen-
tiation among artificially labelled groups is minuscule at any
typical genetic locus does not preclude using all the loci
together to identify groupings of individuals.
A perspective article from Anthony Edwards is illuminat-
ing here [91]. In the article, he shares this quote by the famed
Captain Robert Fitzroy, of the HMS Beagle, who in 1839
wrote: ‘The conclusion to which I have been obliged to
come is—that there is far less difference between most
nations, or tribes (selecting any two for the comparison),
than exists between two individuals who might be chosen
out of either one of those nations or tribes; colour and hair
alone excepted’.
The quote is compelling here for two reasons. First, there is
the similarity between Fitzroy’s conclusion and what would
come to be understood through genetics via Lewontin’s analy-
sis. Second, Edwards does not argue against Fitzroy’s
interpretation. Edwards treats the apportionment of diversity
in humans as a somewhat obvious matter of fact. What he took
issue with was the implication taken from Lewontin’s paper
that one cannot do classification (including building phyloge-
nies) using genetics. Edwards would later say in an interview
‘it is essentially that there are two problems. He [Lewontin]
really wasn’t going from the variation problem to the phyloge-
netic problem’ [7, p. 422].
For his part, Lewontin in his work and later writings,
made clear that he recognized that some form of classification
is possible (e.g. [54,72])—his goal instead was to debate the
apportionment of diversity associated with existing classifi-
cations of human races. As such, both Lewontin and his
apparent critics like Edwards can be understood as addres-
sing
two
closely
related
problems,
neither
actually
contradicting the other.
4. The long-term legacy
(a) The apportionment as sound bite
An important antecedent for Edwards’ critique, relative to
the earlier critiques in the late 1970s, is that by the time
Edwards was writing, the apportionment of diversity result
had been taken up broadly and become an iconic, politicized
and sometimes over-simplified sound bite.
Lewontin’s paper became continually more important
through time (see [5]). Some of its growing influence was
facilitated by Lewontin himself. Lewontin regularly inter-
acted with social scientists and philosophers of science,
often hosting visiting scholars in his laboratory. He was
active in a public outreach group Science for the People. He
repeated the results, for instance in his 1974 book The Genetic
Basis of Evolutionary Change (Richard C. [92]), in a 1982 book
titled Human Diversity that was part of the public-facing
Scientific American Library Series [88], and in his book Not
in Our Genes [34].
However, beyond Lewontin and the 1972 paper, the
empirical fact of the 85%/15% split in diversity within
versus between populations grew a life of its own and was
amplified in numerous ways. This was in part facilitated, as
remarked above, because many other population genetics
researchers found similar results, which had the effect of
amplifying knowledge of the apportionment of diversity.
The highly influential 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man by
Lewontin’s
Harvard colleague Stephen
J.
Gould,
cited
Lewontin’s result in its closing chapter [93]. Another ampli-
fier, though indirect, may have been an influential 1985
paper by philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah [94,95].
Appiah argued there is ‘no biological basis to race’ and his
opening paragraphs reference the apportionment of diversity
via a review paper of Nei and Roychoudhury from 1982
[96] (see Carlson & Harris [5], which contains a section on
the legacy of Nei and Roychoudhury’s work [96]). Given
the strong downstream influence of Appiah’s work, the
1985 paper may have played a role in coupling the apportion-
ment of diversity with the philosophical position of ‘no
biological basis to race’ [95]. By 2001, when the draft
human genome sequences were published, the apportion-
ment of diversity result had become widespread as the
sound bite ‘there is more genetic variation within populations
than between populations’, with the direct ties to Lewontin
being obscured (Carlson & Harris [5]).
It was in this milieu that Anthony Edwards was
approached by his brother to respond to statements about
the lack of a biological basis for human races [7,91]. His con-
cern was that statements circulating at the time seemed to
dispel any possibility of using genetics to study population
history, a field that Anthony Edwards had helped pioneer
with
the
development
of
clustering
and
phylogenetic
methods [46,47]. Thus, an initial draft of Edwards’ paper
was entitled, ‘The Death Of Phylogeny’ and only later, after
Edwards traced the origin of the offending statements to
Lewontin, was the title changed to be ‘Human Genetic Diver-
sity: Lewontin’s Fallacy’ [91].
As an example of a motivating statement, in the 2003
article, Edwards cited a 2001 piece in Nature that claimed
‘two random individuals from any one group are almost as
different as any two random individuals from the entire
world’. Such a statement is true if we inspect a ‘typical’ or
random locus in the genome of the two individuals. How-
ever,
as
statements
about
genome-wide
multi-locus
similarity, it is necessary to introduce more nuance [97]. In
terms of the number of pairwise differences between two
individuals, the 85%/15% result of Lewontin implies that
two random individuals from a given ancestry will have on
average 15% fewer pairwise differences than individuals
sampled across the globe. So the statement that the two indi-
viduals from one group are ‘almost as different’ is vague but
not indefensible. Consider instead the closely related claim
that individuals from distinct populations will be more simi-
lar than individuals from the same population. This is highly
likely when we look at the typical locus in the genome; how-
ever, for multi-locus similarity the claim is often going to be
wrong. A paper by Witherspoon et al. [17] explored the same
question empirically. Asking whether individuals from dis-
tinct populations will be more similar than individuals
from the same population, they found that when focusing
on 100 loci the answer is about 20% of the time, but ‘if genetic
similarity is measured over many thousands of loci, the
answer becomes ‘never’ [17].
These examples stress how it is important to be clear
about what units are being inspected—whether it’s a single
‘typical’
locus
or
‘scoring
the
whole
genome’

Chakroborty’s phrasing (see above). Importantly, regardless
of the subtleties that arise in evaluating these statements,
Lewontin’s key point holds: that human race is ‘skin deep’
in the sense that the apportionment of genetic diversity at a
typical locus does not agree with what we see from physical
features; as a taxonomic category, race only conveys a small
fraction of the total genetic variation in humans.
(b) Not a silver bullet
In appreciating the insight that Lewontin’s result provided, it
is important to understand its limits.
The 1972 paper did not convey concretely how traits
might vary across groups. Later works by several others
extended the implications of Lewontin’s work to quantitative
traits (see [98,99] and references therein). Interestingly, in
simple models, the same apportionment of diversity seen at
single loci should hold for strictly neutrally varying quantitat-
ive traits (i.e. traits whose variants have no pleiotropic fitness
effects). This supports Lewontin’s view in that, for a species
with an apportionment of genetic diversity like that of
humans, one should expect neutrally varying traits to not
greatly differ between populations either.
That said, elevated differentiation between human groups
in genetic variation underlying traits can arise for several
reasons: if the loci underlying a trait have experienced geo-
graphically variable selective pressures (as seen with skin
pigmentation loci), or less obviously, in various cases where
there is stabilizing selection on a trait, even when there is a
single optimum shared between species (e.g. [100,101]). Over-
all, the degree to which variable selective pressures have
acted on variants underlying human traits is still unknown
and is often difficult to understand rigorously using tech-
niques developed to date [101–103].
For some of the most controversial traits of interest (such
as behavioural ones), many practising population geneticists
think geographically varying selective pressures are unlikely
and that any differences (due to selection or otherwise) will
be negligible, especially relative to the rich prior knowledge
of environmental factors and interactions that can shape
such traits (Lewontin was a leader in expressing and arguing
this perspective). Others think that differences between
groups in some form (selected or otherwise) are more likely
to exist than not (e.g, ‘it would be a bad bet to argue’ [79,
p. 258]), and we should prepare society to deal with such
group differences if they are discovered (reaffirming the
widely held ethical position of assigning moral equality to
all individuals), as otherwise pseudo-scientific approaches
and interpretations would likely lead the discussion of any
possible differences.
For Lewontin’s part, he seems to have understood the
main limitations and the utility of his results [54,72,104].
For instance, both are expressed in his Hitchcock lecture at
Berkeley in 2003 [72]. In the lecture, he acknowledges that
his work ‘does not prove … that there isn’t a gene some
place’ that might be important for affecting behaviour and
that varies across populations. While admitting this, he
stressed defensively that ‘nobody’s ever found it’ and
‘there’s no reason to think such things exist’. In a frank
response to a question about what effect his work may
have on those with racial prejudices, he expressed ‘it’s not
clear it has any effect … I have not proved [racially differen-
tiated genes for IQ] don’t exist … .’ He continued, ‘I think
data like these in large part, predispose one toward an under-
standing of the situation, but if you’re a hardcore racist
they’re not going to have any effect at all’.
As Lewontin knew, his result is not a silver bullet that
defeats all possible racist positions, but it does set an impor-
tant prior expectation. On a scientific basis, one can safely
expect that the average variant is not substantially differen-
tiated across race groups, and in turn that race is a poor
proxy for genotype at any one locus of interest. For any dis-
cussion
of
human
variation,
this
is
an
important
‘understanding of the situation’.
5. Conclusion
After considering the controversies and confusions that have
arisen from Lewontin’s 1972 [2] result, it is clear the statistical
subtleties of this topic certainly contributed to the confusion—
at times it seems like Lewontin and critics like Edwards are
involved in the proverbial story of the blindfolded individuals
describing an elephant where one is feeling the trunk and the
other the legs. This conciliatory view is not novel [8,105,106],
though hopefully this article helps convey how the apparent
disagreements weaken upon inspection.
While there are many intellectual frameworks to under-
stand scientific controversies (e.g. [107]), the legacy of
Lewontin’s paper [2] brings to mind a mode of science pos-
ited by sociologist of science Aaron Panofsky that he calls
‘misbehaving science’ [108]. In this mode, controversy is ‘per-
sistent’, ‘ungovernable’ and ‘political’ and ‘scientists are
confounded to draw the boundaries between politics and
science’. And ‘if science is like a machine for resolving contro-
versies, in misbehaving science that machine is broken’.
In the context of paper [2] and its legacy, the idea of ‘mis-
behaving science’ resonates but is not a perfect description of
the situation. On the one hand, the persistent controversy and
legacy following [2] seems outside of normal science. For
example, the early controversies following the 1972 publi-
cation remerged again thirty years later in 2003. The result
became a sound bite about race that is sometimes used
vaguely or in mistaken ways. The existence of a paper titled
‘Lewontin’s Fallacy’ continues to be used, wrongly, in
online discussions of race as if Edwards’ paper is a sufficient
counter-argument to Lewontin’s perspective on the typical
variant. Rarely do normal scientific results have such a com-
plex fate and political life. On the other hand, upon close
inspection, the key scientific controversy falls away, and this
has been appreciated for a long time (see [105,106] and [8]).
Science has ‘behaved’ itself in a sense, even though the politi-
cal controversy and confusions about the implications of the
science have been persistent.
Finally, in reflecting on the legacy of Lewontin’s work, I
hope this narrative has made clear some of the enduring
and positive aspects of Lewontin’s work. To summarize, his
work helps us understand that the typical locus in the
human genome is not as differentiated as one might guess
from looking at our external features. This does not imply
that classification using multi-locus genomic data is not poss-
ible; conversely the ability to use multi-locus data to study
how individuals genetically relate to one another does not
invalidate Lewontin’s result and main conclusion. Fifty
years after the publication, Lewontin’s key empirical claim
still continues to hold true. We continue to see that for a

typical variant, most variance is found within human groups
and little is found between them. This fact has never been a
‘silver bullet’ that ends all discussion of genetics and race.
Yet, as a critique of race as a useful classification system, it
still deepens our understanding of human variation, still
challenges simple interpretations about human differences,
and helps affirm the willful choice to see past the superficial
in how we as humans relate to one another.
