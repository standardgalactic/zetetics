Praise for the Teach Yourself VISUALLY Series
I just had to let you and your company know how great I think your books are. I just purchased my
third Visual book (my first two are dog-eared now!) and, once again, your product has surpassed
my expectations. The expertise, thought, and effort that go into each book are obvious, and I sincerely
appreciate your efforts. Keep up the wonderful work!
—Tracey Moore (Memphis, TN)
I have several books from the Visual series and have always found them to be valuable resources.
—Stephen P. Miller (Ballston Spa, NY)
Thank you for the wonderful books you produce. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I discovered how
I learn—visually. Although a few publishers out there claim to present the material visually, nothing
compares to Visual books. I love the simple layout. Everything is easy to follow. And I understand the
material! You really know the way I think and learn. Thanks so much!
—Stacey Han (Avondale, AZ)
Like a lot of other people, I understand things best when I see them visually. Your books really make
learning easy and life more fun.
—John T. Frey (Cadillac, MI)
I am an avid fan of your Visual books. If I need to learn anything, I just buy one of your books and
learn the topic in no time. Wonders! I have even trained my friends to give me Visual books as gifts.
—Illona Bergstrom (Aventura, FL)
I write to extend my thanks and appreciation for your books. They are clear, easy to follow, and
straight to the point. Keep up the good work! I bought several of your books and they are just right!
No regrets! I will always buy your books because they are the best.
—Seward Kollie (Dakar, Senegal)

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of my mother-in-law, Margaret Smolinski, who never
met a flower, piece of music, or person, and rarely a garage sale, she didn’t like. Her great
grandchildren knew her as Grandma Birdie. Whenever I picked up one of her telephone calls
I was greeted by “Hello, David, this is your mother-in-law, whether you like it or not!” She
will never be forgotten. 
It is also dedicated to Jakob and Alex Cherry, Francesco, Sebastian, and Gino Nicholas
Bubba, Hailee Foster, Rocio, Myles, Kira, Reese, and Zoe Herzog, Marcelo, all their parents,
and, of course, Uncle Ian.

Acknowledgments
It is only appropriate that I acknowledge Wiley acquisitions editor Pam Mourouzis who
broached the idea of this volume to me. It seemed at the time that it would be a lot of fun.
It turned out to be a lot of . . . work! Until you’ve tried it, you have no idea of how
laborious it is to keep shifting the COLOR of the letters that you are typing, but now I
have, and I do. Still, I trust that the result will have been worth that labor. I must also
acknowledge the labor of project editor Suzanne Snyder, for whom this is the fifth project of
mine in a row that she has good-naturedly helped to put together. This was no mean feat,
since for the first time I exceeded my scheduled allotment of time, thereby putting her into
an even more than usual frenetic time crunch. Then there’s Christina Stambaugh who was in
charge of managing such things as getting the interior design created, and Cynthia Kitchel,
my publisher, who went out of her way to accommodate me and went so far as to phone me
to say that she likes my work. Last, but not least, I need to thank my wife, Karen, who
promised that she’d make my life miserable if I did not.

chapter13
Algebraic Word Problems

A
lgebra is a very logical way to solve
problems—both theoretically and practically.
You need to know a number of things. You already
know arithmetic of whole numbers. You will review
the various properties of numbers, as well as using
powers and exponents, fractions, decimals and
percents, and square and cube roots. I am a firm
believer in a picture being worth a thousand words,
so I illustrate anything it’s possible to illustrate and
make extensive use of color. Each chapter concludes
with practice exercises to help you to reinforce your
skills. The solutions to these exercises can be found
at the end of the chapter, just before the Glossary.
The most practical chapter in this book is
undoubtedly the last one, because it brings together
all the skills covered in earlier chapters and helps
you put them to work solving practical word
problems. You may not believe me right now, but
algebra is all about solving word problems—some
of them very practical problems, such as, “How
much tax will I pay on a purchase? How big a
discount is 35% off of something already selling for
25% off? And how good is the gas mileage my
motor vehicle is getting?”

Groups of 
Numbers
2
Before beginning to review or to learn algebra, it is important to feel comfortable with some pre-
algebra concepts including the various groups or realms of numbers with which you will work and
the commonly used mathematical symbols and conventions. The first ones you look at are the
various families of numbers.
COUNTING NUMBERS
Counting numbers are also known as natural
numbers. You use these numbers to count things. In
the time of cave people, counting numbers probably
consisted of one, two, and many and were used to
describe how many woolly mammoths had just
gone by. As people settled into lives based on
agriculture, the need for more specifics arose, so
more modern folks got the familiar 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and so on, as shown here.
WHOLE NUMBERS
Notice the two arrowheads at either end of the
Counting Numbers line. They indicate that the line
continues for an infinite length in both directions—
infinite meaning “without end.” Adding a 0 to the
left of the 1 takes you into the realm of whole
numbers. Whole numbers are not very different
from counting numbers. As the number line shows,
Whole Numbers = Counting Numbers + 0.

INTEGERS
Integers are the next realm. Integers are numbers
into which 1 can be divided without any remainder
being left. Whether or not you’ve ever done algebra
before, you have come across positive and negative
values. You’ve seen them on a thermometer. The
temperature inside your house should always be
positive, and around 68 degrees, but in the winter,
the reported outside temperature in Alaska (or
outside your home) often falls below 0. Those are
also known as negative temperatures. Similarly, the
stock market may close up or down on any given
day. If it makes gains for the day, it’s positive; if the
market loses value, it’s negative.
Notice that every integer has a sign attached to it
except for the integer 0. Zero is neither positive nor
negative, but separates one group from the other.
Additionally, notice that +4 is exactly the same
distance from 0 on its right as –4 is on its left.

RATIONAL NUMBERS
You might think from the name that rational numbers are numbers that make sense—and of course, they
do—but that’s not why they’re called rational numbers. A ratio, from which the name comes, is a
comparison between two quantities.
Say that you have two automobiles, but your neighbor has three. Then the ratio of your cars to your
neighbor’s is . The ratio of your neighbor’s cars to yours, on the other hand, is .
If you’re thinking “I’ve seen those before, but I called them ‘fractions,’” you’re absolutely right. A ratio
is a form of fraction. Any number that can be expressed as a fraction is a rational number. That
includes terminating decimal fractions, such as 0.25; percent fractions, such as 25% (each of which
could be expressed as ); repeating decimals; and any integer (since 5 can be expressed as a fraction: ).
So the realm of rational numbers includes all realms that have come before—including 
. You
will examine ratios and rational numbers much more fully later.
Just for the record, an example of a repeating decimal is the fraction . When it is expressed as a
decimal, it is 0.16666666..., which never stops repeating. For simplification, you put a bar over the
number that repeats and simplify it to 
. I have not attempted to include a number line for rational
numbers for a very good reason: An infinite quantity of rational numbers exists between any two
integers.
IRRATIONAL NUMBERS
Don’t believe that irrational numbers are so angry that they are unable to think rationally. Irrational
numbers come about when a number cannot be expressed as either an integer or a rational number. Two
examples of irrational numbers are 
(the square root of 2) and π (pi). The value of π has been worked
out by computer to be 3 followed by 256 or more decimal places with no repeat occurring. As was the
case with rational numbers, an infinite quantity of irrational numbers can fit between any two integers.

PRIME NUMBERS
A prime number is a number that has exactly two factors, itself and 1. (Factors is a name given to
numbers that are multiplied together.) The first prime number is 2, with factors of 1 and 2. Next is 3,
with factors of 1 and 3. Can you think of any other numbers you could multiply together to make 2 or 3?
What are the next two prime numbers? Four is not prime, since it has three factors: 1, 2, and 4. In fact, 2
is the only even prime number. (We examine that further in a paragraph or so.) The next two primes after
3 are 5 and 7. Then come 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, . . .
Why is it important to know prime numbers? The best answer I can give is it’s a timesaver—especially
when simplifying fractions. If you recognize 19 as a factor of a fraction, and you realize that 19 is a
prime number, then you won’t waste time trying to simplify it further.
EVEN NUMBERS
Every second number is an even one: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . . Counting by 2s is something you probably could
do even before you could add or subtract. Any number with a 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0 in its ones place is an even
number. Note also that all even numbers contain 2 as a factor. That’s why no even number except the
first can be prime. Also note that 0 acts like an even number. The realm of even numbers is infinite.
ODD NUMBERS
Every second number is an odd one. Huh?! Didn’t I just say that every second number is an even one?
Strange as it may seem, that’s not a contradiction. The only difference is the starting point. To name even
numbers you start with 2; you start naming odd numbers with 1. If the ones place of a number contains a
1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, it’s an odd number. The main feature of odd numbers is that dividing them by 2 will not
result in a whole number.

Ways of Showing 
Things in Algebra

SHOWING MULTIPLICATION
Prior to algebra, multiplication has always been shown with a × sign. In algebra there are many different
ways to show multiplication, but × is not one of them.
One of the more popular ways to indicate multiplication is with a
multiplication dot, as shown at right.
There are also three different ways (see right) to show multiplication of two
numbers using parentheses.
We haven’t yet studied variables, but I’m sure it’s no secret to you that algebra often uses letters to stand
for numbers.
Let’s use the variables a, b, and c to stand for three different
numbers. We could multiply these variable numbers by constant
numbers in any of the ways shown above, or we could use the
following notations:
We could also use ac to indicate a times c, ab to indicate a times b, or bc to indicate b times c.
Do you think we could show 2 times 3 by writing 23? Sorry, but that configuration is already known as
the quantity twenty-three.
2 • 3 = 2 × 3
(3)(5) = 15
3(5) = 15
(3)5 = 15
3a means 3 times a.
4b means 4 times b.
5c means 5 times c.

and feel comfortable with them.

The last four symbols above are the ones with which people often have trouble. I know of some people
who remember them as representing alligator jaws, always ready to snap on the larger of the two
quantities. In the case of the two types of greater-than symbols, the number on the left is greater; for the
two less-than symbols, the greater quantity is on the right, so reading from left to right, the first number
is less than the second. A number that is greater than or less than another is a group of numbers that
excludes both named quantities from the group. A number that is greater than or equal to a number
includes the lower number in the group. One that is less than or equal to a number includes the upper
number in the group.
GROUPING SYMBOLS
When writing algebraic expressions and or mathematical sentences (which you’ll learn more about in
Chapter 4), it is often essential to group certain numbers together, either for the sake of clarity, or in
order to specify the sequence in which those numbers should be operated upon. Certain symbols and
rules govern these groupings.

Ways of Showing Things 
in Algebra (continued)

PARENTHESES
The most commonly used grouping symbols are parentheses (). The
equation at the right is a true statement, as you’ll see if you solve
what’s in parentheses on both sides of the = sign:
BRACKETS
When it is necessary to group numbers in parentheses with another group of numbers in parentheses,
you use brackets [ ]. When you use grouping symbols, you must first clear them by combining the
innermost numbers, then working your way outward. In the sentence (below, right) the innermost
numbers are (3 + 4) and (2 + 2).
Is the equation a true statement? By combining the numbers in the
parentheses you get: 3[7 – 4] = 9. Next, you perform the indicated
subtraction, to get 3[3] = 9. Brackets perform the same function as
parentheses, so 3[3] means the same thing as 3(3), which you
should recognize as indicating multiplication. That leaves your
fully interpreted mathematical sentence to read 9 = 9. Thus, 3[(3 +
4) – (2 + 2)] = 9 has proven to be a true statement.
BRACES
Sometimes, although rarely, it is necessary to group
numbers together that already are in bracketed parentheses.
Then we use grouping symbols known as braces {}.
Consider the equation at the right.
Let’s find out whether this mathematical sentence is true or
not. As always, start inside the parentheses first, then move
to the brackets, and finally the braces.
First solve (6 – 4) and (7 – 5). Next, add the 2s. Then
combine the 3 + 4. Finally, multiply.
Remember, the order of use is always parentheses, then
brackets, then braces: {[( )]}. Sometimes larger
parentheses are used as well: 
(4 + 3) = (11 – 4)
7 = 7
3[(3 + 4) – (2 + 2)] = 9
3[7 – 4] = 9
3[3] = 9
9 = 9
6{3 + [(6 – 4) + (7 – 5)]} = 42
6{3 + [2 + 2]} = 42
6{3 + 4} = 42
6{7} = 42
42 = 42

Properties 
and Elements
There are certain properties that apply to addition and multiplication but do not apply to
subtraction or division. You probably came across them in elementary school math, but they are
unlikely to be fresh in your memory, so let’s review them here.
COMMUTATIVE PROPERTY
The commutative property applies to addition and multiplication. It deals with order. Formally stated,
it says that when two numbers are added together or when two numbers are multiplied together, the
order in which they are added or multiplied does not affect the result. Here’s a shorter statement:
The commutative property for addition: (a + b) = (b + a) = a + b
The commutative property for multiplication:
(a • b) = (b • a) = ab
At this point in your algebra career, you might better understand it as follows:
The commutative property for addition: (5 + 3) = (3 + 5) = 8
The commutative property for multiplication:
(5 • 3) = (3 • 5) = 15
ASSOCIATIVE PROPERTY
The associative property also applies to addition and multiplication. It deals with grouping. In order to
understand it, you must first understand that all arithmetic operations are binary. That means that you
can operate on only two numbers at any one time. This may seem to fly in the face of what you learned
about column addition. Remember the columns of four or five numbers, say 3 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 8 all stacked
up over a line segment, as shown here:
3
5
4
9
8
___

Properties and 
Elements (continued)
10
Well, the fact of the matter is, you never added more than two of those numbers together at a time. If you
tried adding that column right now, you’d probably go 3 + 5 = 8; 8 + 4 = 12; 12 + 9 = 21; 21 + 8 = 29.
No contradiction there! You add numbers two at a time, no matter how many there are to add, which
brings you back to the associative property for both addition and multiplication. They say that when
three (or more) numbers are to be added together or when three or more numbers are multiplied together,
the order in which they are grouped for addition or multiplication does not affect the result.
The associative property for addition:
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) = a + b + c
The associative property for multiplication:
(a • b) • c = a • (b • c) = abc
That may also be shown as: 
The associative property for addition:
(5 + 3) + 2 = 5 + (3 + 2) = 10
The associative property for multiplication:
(5 • 3) • 2 = 5 • (3 • 2) = 30
Remember, the commutative property deals with order, the associative property deals with grouping.
IDENTITY ELEMENTS
The identity element is the number that may be combined with another
number without changing its value. For addition, the identity element is 0.
What do you suppose the identity element is for multiplication? That’s right, it’s
1. It’s demonstrated here:
For subtraction, the identity element is once again 0.
For division, the undoing of multiplication, the identity element is once again 1.
Remember, the fraction line symbolizes division.
0 + 3 = 3
n + 0 = n
5 • 1 = 5
1 • y = y
7 – 0 = 7
n – 0 = n

DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY
The distributive property is used to remove grouping symbols (usually parentheses) by sharing a
multiplier outside the grouped numbers with those on the inside. It always involves numbers that are
added together or subtracted within the grouping symbols. For that reason, it is often referred to as the
distributive property of multiplication over addition.
In the first example at the right, notice that the 3 was distributed. 
The second example involves subtraction.
3(5) + 3(2) = 15 + 6
4(6) – 4(3) = 24 – 12

Exponents 
and Powers
12
An exponent is a number written small to the right and high off the line next to another number.
In 23, 3 is the exponent, and 2 is the base. An exponent expresses the power to which a number is
to be raised (or lowered). (I discuss the lowering power of certain exponents in a later chapter.) 
What They Do
An exponent after a number tells the number of times the base number is
to be multiplied by itself (see examples at right).
Many would argue that an exponent and a power are the same thing, but
they really are not. An exponent is a symbol for the power (how many of
the base number are multiplied together). The first example would be read
four to the second power, or four squared (more about that in a moment).
The second depicts two to the third power, or two cubed (more about that
in a moment, as well). The third shows six to the fourth power. 
The exponents 2 and 3 have special names, based
upon a plane and a solid geometric figure. Because
the square’s area is found by multiplying one side by
itself, raising something to the second power is
called squaring. Since the volume of a cube is
found by multiplying one side by itself and by itself
again, raising something to the third power is called
cubing. These terms are in common use and chances
are that you’ve heard them before. A list of the first
12 perfect squares (squares of whole numbers) is
shown at the right.
42 = 4 • 4
23 = 2 • 2 • 2
64 = 6 • 6 • 6 • 6
12 = 1
22 = 4
32 = 9
42 = 16
52 = 25
62 = 36
72 = 49
82 = 64
92 = 81
102 = 100
112 = 121
122 = 144

chapter1
The Basics
13
To cube a number, multiply it by itself and then do
it again. A list of the first 12 perfect cubes (cubes
of whole numbers) is shown at the right. 
Comparing squares and cubes to whole numbers,
you should note that squares get big very quickly,
but not nearly as quickly as cubes.
Any number raised to a power of 1 is that number
itself: 31 = 3; 131 = 13.
Any number raised to a power of 0 is equal to 1: 50
= 1; 180 = 1. This is explained further in a
following section.
13 = 1
23 = 8
33 = 27
43 = 64
53 = 125
63 = 216
73 = 343
83 = 512
93 = 729
103 = 1000
113 = 1331
123 = 1728
Operations Using Exponents and Powers
It is possible to perform all four arithmetic operations on numbers raised to powers, but some very
specific rules apply. You can examine them as they apply to each of the operations, starting with
multiplication.
MULTIPLYING
To multiply numbers with the same base, all you have to do is keep the base the same and add the
exponents:
32 • 32 = 32 + 2 = 34
34 = 81
Check it: →32 • 32 = 9 • 9 
= 81
53 • 53 = 53 + 3 = 56
56 = 15,625
Check it: →53 • 53 = 125 • 125 = 15,625
24 • 23 = 24 + 3 = 27
27 = 128
Check it: →24 • 23 = 16 • 8 
= 128
Suppose that the bases are different, such as 23 and 42? When the bases
are different, each number must be expanded. First find 23 which is 
2 • 2 • 2 = 8; 42 is 4 • 4 = 16. Then multiply the results to get 
8 • 16 = 128.
You’ll find practice examples at the end of the chapter on page 18.
23 and 42 = ___
2 • 2 • 2 = 8
4 • 4 = 16
8 • 16 = 128

ADDING AND SUBTRACTING
To add or subtract numbers with exponents, whether the bases are the same or not, each expression must
be evaluated (expanded) and then the addition or subtraction found. Answers are at the end of the
chapter.
Exponents and 
Powers (continued)
14
DIVIDING
To divide numbers with the same base, all you have to do is keep the base the same and subtract the
exponents. Does that sound like the exact opposite of multiplication? You bet:
33 ÷ 32 = 33 – 2 = 31
31 = 3
Check it: →33 ÷ 32 = 27 ÷ 9 
= 3
54 ÷ 52 = 54 – 2 = 52
52 = 25
Check it: →54 ÷ 52 = 625 ÷ 25 = 25
26 ÷ 23 = 26 – 3 = 23
23 = 8
Check it: →26 ÷ 23 = 64 ÷ 8 
= 8
Here’s a bonus explanation. It’s the one promised two sections back. This
is why any number raised to the 0 power = 1. Let n stand for any number,
or if you’d prefer, you can substitute any number you like for n. The results
will be the same. In the first line to the right, you see n3 ÷ n3. But that is a
number divided by itself. Any number divided by itself = 1, so n0, which
you see in the second line, equals 1. Pretty cool, don’t you think?
As with multiplication, if the bases are different, you have to expand each
value before combining. For example, to find 42 ÷ 23, you first find the
values of each, 16 and 8; then you divide: 16 ÷ 8 = 2.
n3 ÷ n3 = n3 – 3
n3 – 3 = n0

base the same as it was, but

Square Roots 
and Cube Roots
Operating with square roots and cube roots in algebra is explored later in this book. For now, I am
concerned with defining them, identifying them, and simplifying them.
IDENTIFYING SQUARE ROOTS AND CUBE ROOTS
The square root of a number is the number that when
multiplied by itself gives that number. The square root
or radical sign looks like this: 
. You read 
as
“the square root of 25.” A list of the first 12 perfect
(whole number) square roots is given at right.
Square roots may also be identified using a fractional exponent .
For example, an alternative to writing the square root of 144 is
shown at right.
The cube root of a number is the number that
when multiplied by itself twice gives that number.
The cube root bracket looks like this: 
. You read
as “the cube root of 27.” A list of the first 12
perfect (whole number) cube roots is given at
right.
Cube roots may also be identified using a fractional exponent .
For example, an alternative to writing the cube root of 1728 is
shown at right.

SIMPLIFYING SQUARE ROOTS
Not all numbers have perfect square roots; in fact, most of them
do not. Some square roots, however, can be simplified. Take, for
example, 
. It is possible to do some factoring beneath the
radical sign.
Note that you can factor a perfect square (4) out of the 40. Then
you can remove the square 4 from under the radical sign, writing
its square root in front of the sign, so 
becomes 2 times 
.
Do you see any way to simplify 
? Look for a perfect square that
is a factor of 45. 9 is such a number. The square root of 9 is 3, so
remove the 9 from under the radical sign and write a 3 in front of it.
The simplest form of 
is 
.
APPROXIMATING SQUARE ROOTS
For the majority of numbers that are not perfect squares, it is sometimes necessary to approximate a
square root. Take, for example, 
. 49 < 57 < 64. That means 57 is between 49 and 64, or greater than
49 and less than 64. 
should fall between 7 and 8, the square roots of 49 and 64, respectively. 57 is
about halfway between 49 and 64, so try 7.5. 7.52 = 56.25; try a little higher: 7.62 = 57.76. The number
you’re looking for is about halfway between both of those results, so try halfway between. 7.552 =
57.0025. Now that’s pretty darned good. 
Generally, the square roots of nonperfect squares can be found
using a table or a calculator that has a square root function.

Zero, FOO, and 
Divisibility
DIVISIBILITY TESTS
You can save time when factoring (or dividing) numbers by following these rules.
MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING BY ZERO
0 • anything = 0. Maybe you already knew that, but I can’t emphasize it too much. If you have 5 apples
0 times, how many apples do you have? The answer is 0. How much is 5,000 • 0? Anything times 0 is 0.
Remember the commutative property for multiplication from earlier in this chapter. Division by zero
does not exist. Anything divided by 0 is undefined. Since a fraction is, among other things, a division,
the denominator of a fraction can never equal 0.

igned numbers are a basic tool of algebra. In
fact, every number you’ll ever deal with in
algebra is a signed number, whether or not you can
see that sign. In this chapter, I help you to build an
understanding of signed numbers, which are not as
esoteric as they might appear at first blush. Unless
you live somewhere like Florida, you’ve likely
come across them at one time or another in the
weather forecast on a particularly wintry day.
You’ve also possibly experienced them on your
bank statement when you have a negative balance
from inadvertently spending more than was in your
account. With those two cheerful thoughts in mind,
here’s hoping that you’re reading this with a
positive temperature on the thermometer and 
a positive bank balance.

Introducing Signed 
Numbers
24
It is not uncommon for people to have difficulty comprehending the concept of signed numbers
and their universality. For that reason, the Madison Project—a federally funded math-teaching
improvement project with which I had the honor of being associated—set out to find many
everyday experiences in which to couch this basic building block of algebra. It is with that purpose
in mind that the devices of balloons and sandbags, letter carrier stories, and the apartment house
(which immediately follows) came to exist. The hope was and is that being able to relate this totally
theoretical fact with something that can be related to in everyday life will facilitate your ability to
understand the concept.
An Apartment Analogy
A large apartment building was built on the side of a hill. It looked remarkably like the building shown
on the following page. The main floor was the entry level of the building, and to go from floor to floor
you rode in an elevator. Of course, to get to the floor you wanted, you needed to press the correct button
in the elevator.
In the town where this building was located, an ordinance said that for a floor to be numbered with a
positive number (1, 2, 3, and so on), that floor had to be completely above ground level. As you can see
on the following page, some of the floors were completely above ground level, and others were not.

chapter2
Signed Numbers
25
The entrance level could have been called “main
floor” or “lobby,” but since the elevator buttons
were so tiny, the manufacturer chose to put a 0 on
that button. All the numbers above ground level
were labeled by which level above the ground they
were and were prefixed by a positive sign (+), just
for emphasis. The floors below entry level were
labeled according to how many levels below the
entry level they were and were prefixed by a
negative sign (–).
How great is the distance between the +3 level and
the 0 level? How about the –3 level and the 0 level?
I hope you said “3” in response to each of those
questions. If you’re not sure, use the number line on
page 30, place a fingernail on 0 and count the
number of spaces you cross to get to +3. Then do
the same thing with 0 and –3. How great is the
distance between the +5 level and the –5 level?
Count it out just to make sure. Did you get 10? Are
you positive? That last one was kind of a trick
question, but if a number doesn’t have a negative
sign in front of it, it’s considered positive.
Remember that. It’ll come in handy.
What’s the difference between the 9th floor and the
–8th floor? Here’s where the last sentence in the
previous paragraph proves to be true. The 9th floor
is 9 levels above 0; the –8th floor is 8 levels below
0. That’s a total difference of 17 floors.

Adding Balloons 
and Sandbags
26
A hermit named Frank lived in a small cabin on the
edge of a cliff. The ground around Frank’s cabin
was quite sandy, so it just sat on that sandy ground
without having any kind of foundation.
Frank was quite happy living there in peace and
quiet. Then, suddenly, he was awakened one
morning by the clatter and roar of heavy
construction machinery digging in the valley below.
After several hours of thinking and grumbling,
Frank went to the store, returning several hours later
carrying a fat package under one arm and wheeling
a cylinder of helium in front of him. After some
minutes of fussing, Frank attached two helium-filled
balloons to the roof of his house. One was a +8
balloon, and the other was a +6 balloon, as you can
see here.
The balloons had the effect of lifting the house right
off of the cliff. How high above the cliff do you
think the house went? You should be able to draw
the following conclusion: Frank added a +8 balloon;
that’s + (+8), which is so named because it elevated
the house 8 feet. Then he added a +6 balloon; that’s
+ (+6), which elevated the house 6 more feet.
+ (+8) + (+6) = +14, or a total elevation of 14 feet.
The additional 14 feet of height between Frank’s
house and the construction machinery deadened the
sound just enough to enable Frank to keep hanging
around the neighborhood (pun intended).

After two or three days of hanging around 14 feet
above the cliff, Frank realized that he was running
out of groceries. He couldn’t just jump out and go
shopping, but thankfully, he had prepared for such
an eventuality on the day he had brought home the
helium cylinder. Buried in the package under his
arm was a long, flexible plastic tube and a battery-
powered suction pump. Being resourceful, he
weighted down one end of the tube and unrolled it
out a window until it reached the ground. Then he
connected the other end of the tube to the suction
pump and sucked up a good quantity of sand (you’ll
recall that his house originally sat on quite sandy
ground). He used the sand to fill a couple of
sandbags, which he hung. One was a –9 sandbag
and the other was a –6 sandbag.
The sandbags had the effect of lowering the house
below the cliff. How far below the edge of the cliff
do you think the house ended up? You should be
able to draw the following conclusion:
Frank added a –9 sandbag; that’s + (–9), which is so
named because it lowered the house 9 feet. Then he
added a –6 sandbag; that’s + (–6), which lowered
the house 6 more feet.
Therefore: + (–9) + (–6) = –15
But since the house was 14 feet above the cliff to
begin with, 14 + (–15) gives it a total elevation of
–1 feet, or 1 foot below the edge of the cliff. That
allows Frank to put out a board and then walk onto
the cliff-top to go grocery shopping.

Subtracting Balloons 
and Sandbags
28
One day, Frank the hermit was sitting in his cabin
floating serenely above the cliff with many balloons
and sandbags attached to his cabin, and he realized
that he was getting low on flashlight batteries. He
was, in fact, so low on battery power that he
couldn’t operate the pump he usually used to collect
sand in order to lower his house. What was he to
do? He pondered for several hours, until suddenly
he came up with a plan. Getting out a pair of shears
with a very long reach, he stretched out of his
window and cut a balloon off of the house. It turned
out to have been a +7 balloon. What do you think
happened as a result?
The house dropped exactly 7 feet.
“My word,” Frank exclaimed. “Cutting off a balloon
has the same effect as adding a sandbag.” Next, he
stretched out of his window and cut another balloon
off of the house. It was a +10 balloon. What do you
think happened as a result?
Hopefully, you realized that the house dropped
exactly 10 feet more. Let’s represent the events of
the last few paragraphs mathematically:
Cutting off two balloons of specified values:
– (+7) – (+10) = –17
That says that removing a +7 balloon and removing
a +10 balloon causes the house to drop 17 feet.

29
Another day, Frank had just returned from shopping
and there were lots of balloons and sandbags
attached to the house. He was about to inflate a
couple of balloons to get away from the din in the
valley below when he discovered that he was out of
helium. This time, he didn’t even hesitate; he got
out his shears and cut off a –9 sandbag from
beneath the cabin. What do you think was the result
of that? That’s right—the house was lifted +9 feet.
Not content with being so low, Frank cut off another
–9 sandbag from beneath the cabin. Where did the
cabin end up?
Cutting off two sandbags of the specified amounts:
– (–9) – (–9) = +18
If you can think about the next section in terms of
adding or removing balloons or sandbags and the
attendant results, you will be going a long way
toward understanding the basics of algebra.

Understanding 
Number Lines
30
You looked briefly at number lines in Chapter 1 when examining the various groups of numbers.
In algebra, every number has a sign associated with it, except for 0.
As you can see on this integer number line, 0
separates the positive integers from the negative
ones. A negative number is always preceded by a
negative sign (–). If a number has no sign in front
of it, it is understood to be positive (+). Both signs
are considered separate and apart from the
operational signs minus and plus (– and +), which
indicate subtraction and addition, respectively.
Among the conventions you need to know about
any number line is that if you see arrowheads at
either end, they indicate that the sequence
represented on the line goes on forever in the
direction of that arrowhead. Numbers increase in
value from left to right and decrease in value from
right to left. That means any number is greater than
the one to the left of it and smaller than the one to
its right, regardless of their signs.
Notice that it is also possible to have number lines
containing fractions and/or mixed numbers. The
other essential convention on a number line is that
the intervals between any two numbers must be the
same, whether counting by halves (as in this figure
to the right), by ones (as in the above figure), or by
twos, fives, or tens.

Adding Signed 
Numbers
Here’s where it might help you to think back to Frank the hermit and his balloons and sandbags. To add
any two positive numbers together, simply add their values together and append a positive sign (or not).
For example: +2 + +5 = +7, or just plain 7.
To add any two negative numbers together, simply add their values together and append a negative sign.
For example: –3 + –6 = –9.
Notice that the negative sign must be there.
Adding a positive to a negative gets a little tricky. That’s because the result depends on which quantity
has the greater absolute value. The absolute value is the distance of a number from 0. Look at the top
figure on the previous page, and you’ll see that +3 and –3 have the same absolute values. Each is 3 units
from 0. In the bottom figure on the previous page, 
has the same absolute value as 
. The
statement |–5| = 5 is read “the absolute value of negative 5 equals 5.”
Now consider this: +7 + –3 = __.
Because the signs are different, the two quantities are going to be subtracted. What? That’s an addition
sign; how can you subtract? Go back to the hermit for a moment. Suppose he adds a +7 balloon and a –3
sandbag to the house at the same time. What would the net result be? You have an upward force of +7
acting against a downward force of –3. That’s a net upward force of +4. Where did that +4 come from?
From subtraction, of course. But how can you subtract when it says . . . ? 
Now cut that out!
If it helps you, you can think of rewriting +7 + –3 = __ as +7 – +3 = __; just exchange the two signs.
Now here’s a final thought on the subject: The answer takes the sign of the addend (the number being
added) with the larger absolute value. Because +7 has a greater absolute value than –3, the answer is +4.

Subtracting 
Signed Numbers
32
You’ve subtracted signed numbers before; you just never realized you were doing it.
Look at 27 – 14 = 13. You just didn’t know that they were positives you
were subtracting. Look at the same subtractions with the signs in place: 
To subtract one positive signed number from another positive signed number, switch the inner signs: +27
+ –14 = __. Minus a positive becomes plus a negative. You may be asking how you can do that, and I’m
going to have to ask you to take my word for it for the moment. It will become evident when you deal
with signed number multiplications. 
Look again at the new, rewritten subtraction: 
It’s now an addition, and you already studied how to handle that. You
subtract the absolute values, and the answer takes the sign of the number
with the larger absolute value: +27 + –14 = +13.
How would you handle this subtraction? 
It starts off just like the last one, with an exchange of the inner two signs:
Now what? It should look familiar. It’s an addition of two negatives (two
sandbags, if you will). When adding two negatives, you add the absolute
values and give the sum a negative sign. Piece of cake!
+27 – +14 = +13
+27 + –14 = __ 
–12 – +8 = __
–12 + –8 = __
–12 + –8 = –20
TIP
Did your mother, father, or teacher ever point out to you that a double negative is a
positive? It certainly is in the English language! What does the next sentence mean? “I am
not not going to the fair.” It means “I am going to the fair.” The two not’s cancel each other
out. The same is true with signed numbers, so watch out for the double negative.

chapter2
Signed Numbers
33
Look at this subtraction:
From the tip, you can conclude that the double 
negative becomes a positive, therefore:
You might argue that it became a double
positive, so I’ll concede and make it 
+8 + 6 = ___. Remember, there doesn’t have
to be a positive sign to make it a positive
number. 
Next, combine the 6 and 8 to get 14, so:
Now consider the last possible unique case:
Once again, a double negative must be dealt
with, and you should know how to do that:
Because the signs are different now, you solve
the equation by subtracting the absolute values
and keeping the sign of the addend with the
greater absolute value. The sum is –1.
+8 – –6 = ___
+8 – –6 = ___
becomes
+8 + +6 = ___.
+8 – –6 = 14
–9 – –8 = ___
–9 – –8 = ___
becomes
–9 + 8 = ___

Minus Sign before 
Parentheses
34
The only rule that makes subtraction of signed numbers different from addition is the Change the
Signs rule. After the sign of the number being subtracted has been changed, the subtraction
becomes an addition of signed numbers and follows all the various rules for addition. 
Sometimes you’ll find a minus sign
in front of parentheses, such as 
–(–6 +5 –3 +3 –4). The solution is to
change all the signs within the
parentheses and change the minus to
a plus; then add:
The parentheses are now meaningless, so:
Notice that not all plus signs or addition signs were written.
Sometimes the signs speak for themselves and indicate
what’s to be done. Sometimes the positive signs are omitted
altogether and are replaced by addition signs. That may take
some getting used to.
–(–6 +5 –3 +3 –4)
becomes
+(+6 –5 +3 –3 +4)
+6 –5 +3 –3 +4 = +1 +0 +4
+1 +0 +4 = +5, or 5
TIP
It is very common to think about numbers getting
bigger the farther they get from zero, and this is very
true of positive numbers. That is, 12 is bigger than 3, 
47 is bigger than 12, and so forth. But, all things
considered, it might not be quite so obvious that the
opposite is true when dealing with negative numbers.
That is to say, numbers get smaller as they get farther
away from zero. Think about it. –3 is smaller than –1,
–12 is smaller than –3, and –64 is smaller than –12.
Conversely, the closer a positive number gets to zero,
the smaller it is, yet the closer a negative number gets to
zero, the larger it is. It can be kind of mind boggling
until you put it into perspective.

Letter Carrier Stories to 
Illustrate Multiplication
When these first were devised by the Madison Project they were known as “Postman Stories.”
Isn’t it wonderful how far political correctness has brought us!
Once upon a time, there was a rather eccentric letter
carrier who never paid much attention to the names
on the envelopes she delivered. In a day or two
she’d come back and say, “I’m sorry, Mr. Smith, but
I need to take back the mail I gave you the other
day; those envelopes were for Mr. Brown and Ms.
Ortega.”
Mr. Smith didn’t pay attention to the names on the
checks and bills that the letter carrier brought. A
check is a draft on a bank that you may consider
income. A bill is a statement asking you for money,
such as one from the electric company.
When Mr. Smith receives checks in
the mail, he considers himself to be
richer by the face amounts of those
checks. When he receives bills, he
considers himself to be poorer by the
amounts of those bills, since once
paid, that’s money he no longer has in
his account. Let’s see how that works.

One day, the letter carrier brought 4 checks for $7
each. Mathematically, that’s represented this way:
Clearly this is a multiplication. In order to figure
out what the sign of the product will be, you need
to ask yourself: “As a result of the letter carrier’s
visit, will Mr. Smith consider himself to be richer
or poorer?” The letter carrier brought checks, so
Mr. Smith believes he is better off by the amount
of money those checks are worth. That means
that the product will be positive. Now multiply
the two numbers and get a result of +28. That
means he believes himself to be better off by $28.
On another occasion, the letter carrier brought
Mr. Smith 3 bills for $16 each. We represent
that mathematically like this:
To figure out what the sign of the product will
be, you again need to ask yourself, “As a result
of this letter carrier’s visit, will Mr. Smith
consider himself to be richer or poorer?” The
letter carrier brought bills, so Mr. Smith
believes that he is poorer by the amount of
money those bills will cost. That means that the
product will be negative. Now multiply the two
numbers and get a result of –48. That means he
believes himself to be poorer by $48 as a result
of this visit.

The letter carrier had to return to Mr. Smith’s house
to tell him that those 5 checks for $8 each had not
really been intended for him, and she had to take
them back. Fortunately, Mr. Smith hadn’t tried to
cash them—fortunately for the letter carrier, who
needed to correct her mistake, and for Mr. Smith,
who might have found himself arrested for fraud.
The equation to the right represents mathematically
the letter carrier’s visit that morning:
As a result of this visit, will Mr. Smith consider
himself to be richer or poorer, and by how much?
That shouldn’t be too hard to figure out. He’s
having checks taken away from him. That’s
money he thought he had, so he’s going to
consider himself poorer. That means a 
negative sign. How much poorer? Multiply 5 • 8.
The answer is –40, or poorer by $40.
Are you ready for the pièce de resistance?
On another day, the letter carrier comes and tells Mr. Smith that she’s there to reclaim the 6 bills for $12
each that she had delivered the day before. They weren’t meant for Mr. Smith after all. This transaction
is represented mathematically here:
How does Mr. Smith consider himself to have been affected by the letter carrier’s visit? Does he believe
himself to be richer, poorer, or exactly the same as before she came? Bills were taken away. That meant
money he thought he would have to pay can now go back into his pocket. Is that a positive or a negative
experience? Having more money always struck me as a positive thing, so the answer is +72.
You should be able to draw some conclusions from these letter carrier stories that will serve you well in
understanding the multiplication and division of signed numbers. Keep this model in mind as you go

Only two conditions for multiplying signed numbers are possible, even though four were covered
in the letter carrier stories on the preceding pages. If you relate the conditions to the letter carrier
stories, you should be able to understand them. 
First, consider two positives. Multiplying two positive numbers is the same as the letter carrier bringing
checks. The result is positive.
Now consider two negatives. That is the same as the letter carrier taking away bills. Again, the result is
positive. Can you draw a conclusion from those two instances? You betcha! When multiplying two
numbers, if the signs are the same, the product is positive. Remember also, that you can never multiply
more than two numbers at a time. If three numbers are being multiplied, you must multiply two of them
together first and then multiply the product by the third number. (This is the associative property, which
was covered in Chapter 1.)
Next, consider the possible situations involving two different signs. If you have a positive times a
negative, that’s the same as the letter carrier bringing bills—a decidedly negative situation. Now try the
reverse, a negative times a positive. That is analogous to the letter carrier’s taking back checks; that’s not
something to look forward to, either, and so is another negative. What conclusion can you draw from
these two examples? When multiplying two numbers, if the signs are different, the product is negative.

ractions, decimals, and percents all deal with
parts of things and are all, to some extent,
interchangeable with one another. As you worked
with signed number arithmetic in the last chapter,
somewhere in your mind you probably knew that it
could not apply only to whole numbers. The time to
extend that knowledge is now, as you look at how to
handle signed fractions, decimals, and percents and
how to exchange one for the other. Don’t discount
(excuse the pun) the fact that a knowledge of
percentage can help you save big money at sales.
It’s also quite interesting. Finally, scientific notation
makes it possible for the scientific community to
treat very large and very small quantities in a
manageable fashion. You don’t have to be a nuclear
scientist or a molecular chemist to use them, but it
couldn’t hurt.

The Concept 
of Fractions
Fractions take many different forms and can represent many different things. When you think of a
fraction, you probably picture something like , and you define it as a part of a whole. In fact,
that’s only part of the story—and a very small part at that (no pun intended). A fraction may be a
ratio, comparing two different things; it may be a division example, as 
; or it may be a whole
unto itself, as would be a piece of pie. I know I’ve never heard anyone ask for 
of a pie.
The kinds of fractions shown here are
called common fractions and sport
both numerators and denominators.
You can’t lose sight of the fact that
decimals and percents are also types
of fractions. Decimal fractions are
based on ten tenths equaling one
whole. Percent fractions are based on
100 representing one whole. You
usually don’t refer to decimal
fractions and percent fractions as
such, but rather you call them
decimals and percents, respectively;
just don’t lose sight of the fact that
they are types of fractions.
The term fraction used by itself in this
book refers to common fractions.
Fractions can be displayed on a
number line, as shown early in
Chapter 1. They, as well as integers,
may be negative or positive. How to
operate with signed fractions of one
sort or another is what this chapter is
all about.

Adding Signed Fractions
When working with signed fractions, the same rules apply that apply to
whole numbers, and to nonsigned fractions, for example. Consider the
following:
The first thing that should be apparent is that (from what you
know about fractions) you can’t add without first finding a
common denominator.
Now that you have both fractions in terms of the common denominator,
you apply the rules of adding signed numbers: When the signs are
different, you subtract, and the sum takes the sign of the addend with the
greater absolute value:
From here on, you can avoid writing unnecessary
positive signs. Do one more addition:
You express halves and thirds in terms of sixths.
Then, since the signs are the same, you add the
fractions’ values together. Finally, you express the
sum in the simplest terms.

Adding and Subtracting 
Signed Fractions
46
Negative fractions can be written in three different ways as shown here.
Although all three mean the same thing, the third way is how negative
fractions are usually written. Can you see why the first two forms mean
the same thing? It’s because, as you just saw in the last chapter, a negative
divided by a positive and a positive divided by a negative both result in a
negative.

Subtracting Signed Fractions
Do you remember how to subtract signed whole numbers? Again, the
same rules apply. Start with two fractions that already have the same
denominator:
Do you remember the double negative rule? 
That means the subtraction has become addition:
Finally, you add and simplify the sum:
Of course, if the denominators were different, you would find a
common one, convert, and proceed from there. Try one more example:
Here, you must rewrite both fractions in terms of the common
denominator, which is sixths:
Next, you adjust the signs (minus a positive becomes plus a
negative), and then, since the signs are the same, you add.
And there you have it!

Multiplying Signed Fractions
In case you don’t recall, to multiply fractions, you multiply the
denominators together and multiply the numerators together, not
necessarily in that order, and then simplify the product if necessary, so as
to leave it in its simplest form. If possible, you cancel before multiplying
so as to make the process easier and avoid having to simplify the product.
To multiply signed fractions, you follow both the rules for multiplying
fractions and those for multiplying signed integers: Like signs give
positive products, and unlike signs yield negative ones. Here are a couple
of examples:
The first thing to notice is that the signs are different. That means the
product is going to be negative. It’s also possible to do some canceling:
Finally, you multiply numerators and denominators:
And that’s one down. If you did not understand anything about this
example, please study the steps again. You might need to refresh yourself
on multiplying signed numbers (Chapter 2) or multiplying fractions
(summarized previously).

Signed Fractions
48
Multiplication and division of signed fractions incorporate techniques that you have already
studied, both in earlier grades when you learned how to operate with fractional multiplication and
in Chapter 2 when you dealt with multiplication and division of signed integers. In this section,
you review each of those techniques very briefly and then look at a couple of examples of each
technique.

Here’s another example:
Notice right off that the signs are both negative. When the signs are
the same, the product is positive. It doesn’t look like there’s room for
canceling, either:
Multiplying numerators and denominators brings you to the final
product. You could have left the positive sign, but it’s superfluous.

Dividing Signed Fractions
Division of fractions takes advantage of the fact that division is the reciprocal operation for
multiplication. A reciprocal, you may recall, is the number by which you multiply another one to get a
product of 1. So, the reciprocal of 3 is ; the reciprocal of 
is 4; and the reciprocal of 
is . 
When dividing one fraction by another, the divisor (second fraction) is
replaced by its reciprocal, and the divided-by sign becomes a times sign.
You may have learned to perform this logical process by the rote phrase
“invert and multiply.” From then on, you follow the rules for multiplying
fractions and the rules for multiplying signed integers: Like signs give
positive products, and unlike signs yield negative ones. Here is an
example:
1 Are you tempted to cancel? Don’t do it! Canceling can
only be done across a × sign. Step 1 is to change this
division to a reciprocal multiplication:

2 Now is when you would cancel if it were possible, which it isn’t. You
now have a signed fraction multiplication with unlike signs. That
means the quotient (the answer in a division) is negative; multiply:
Look at a second example:
1 First you need to rewrite the division as a reciprocal multiplication:
2 Now that there’s a × sign, is it possible to cancel? You betcha! 
So do it:
3 Do you see any other canceling that can be done there?
Actually, you end up with this:

Multiplying and Dividing 
Mixed Numbers
Fractions greater than 1 are also known as mixed numbers when expressed with a whole number
part followed by a fractional part. Recall that when adding and subtracting mixed numbers, the
whole number parts are done together and the fractional parts are done together (added or
subtracted). Of course, when the mixed numbers are signed, the normal signed number rules for
addition and subtraction must be followed.
Multiplying Signed Fractions Greater Than 1
To multiply mixed numbers, you must first convert
each mixed number to a fraction with a numerator
larger than the denominator. The conversion is
achieved by multiplying the whole number by the
fraction’s denominator and then adding its
numerator to the product. That amount is then put
over the fraction’s denominator. 
Solve the following multiplication:
Convert both mixed numbers:
Finally, multiply and simplify:
Do you get the picture? Notice that the laws governing signed
number multiplication were followed.

Simplifying 
Complex Fractions
Sometimes fractions contain other fractions in the numerator, other fractions in the denominator,
or both. There’s an example of each case below.
Let’s see how to go about simplifying each of those
complex fractions. The best thing to keep in mind as
you plan your strategy is you must not have an
addition or subtraction sign within a fraction. Do
whatever you need to do to remove it (remember, 
I’m talking plus and minus, not to be confused 
with positive and negative).
To get rid of the plus sign in the numerator of this
fraction, you’re going to have to do some adding:
Now you have a negative fraction over a positive integer. But any integer can be
expressed as a fraction—in this case . What does the following mean?
Remember, any fraction is also a division example, so 
means the same as 
. To solve that, you turn the
division into a multiplication by the reciprocal of the divisor:
You have some canceling opportunities here:
Now that’s what I call a solution.

Here comes another one. Remember the main rule governing complex
fractions (from the top of the previous page)?
The first thing you need to do is get rid of that
addition sign. You do that by finding the LCD for
8ths and 3rds, which is, if I recall correctly, 24ths:
Now what are you going to do with +7 over 
? Keeping in mind that
every integer can be expressed as a fraction, how about this?
Then you turn that into a division:
Last but not least, you solve that division by making it a reciprocal
multiplication:
Let’s cancel and multiply:

Now that you’ve seen how to handle the straightforward ones, try dealing
with a couple of twists. The main rule from the last page still applies, but
its application is a bit trickier with this complex fraction and others of its
ilk. For openers, mixed numbers are not helpful as part of a complex
fraction.
The first task is to get rid of the mixed numbers by changing
them to fractions with numerators greater than their
denominators. Perhaps you’ve noticed that I’ve avoided
using the term improper fractions. If you ever come across
it, be aware of the fact that it is an antiquated term for
fractions with numerators greater than their denominators.
On the other hand, for it to be an improper fraction in my
estimate, it would have had to stay out past 1:30 A.M.
without having called home. No fractions should ever be left
with numerators greater than their denominators (unless
instructed to do so), since there is a much more
understandable way of writing them (mixed numbers), but
they can be very useful as a means to an end. You start by
rewriting the mixed numbers above:
The new numerator is now an addition (remember the
double negative), so there is a reversal of fortune for the
second fraction on top:

Next, you need to find like denominators
for both terms of the fraction. (The
numerator and the denominator is each a
term.) Here it’s done step by step:
Now you can perform the addition:
Note that the superfluous positive sign was
dropped. You have a division here, so perform the
appropriate reciprocal multiplication and get it over
with. Nice round answer, don’t you think?

Changing Decimals 
to Fractions
As you should know, decimals are also a form of fraction, based on dividing 1 by multiples of the
number 10. Any decimal can be expressed as a common fraction simply by saying its decimal
name and then writing the fraction equivalent. 
Here are three examples:
0.3 means three tenths 
0.07 means seven hundredths 
–0.211 means negative two hundred eleven thousandths 
Did you think I had forgotten that we’re dealing with signed numbers? Not likely! Certain decimals
deserve special attention because they simplify to become fractions that we encounter every day. Here
are some examples of those:
not to mention
The decimals shown here are all terminating decimals, which means that they consist of a certain
number of figures and then end. Certain decimals are repeating ones that never end. An example of that
is 0.3333... The ellipsis (three dots) following the last written figure indicates that it goes on doing the
same thing forever. This is sometimes represented by a bar over the repeating character, as pictured here:

What Are 
Percents?
58
You know what percents look like. They are numbers with those funny-looking “%” squiggles
after them. Does the squiggle look like anything you’ve seen before? How about a fraction ( )?
Well, a percent is a fraction, but it’s a different kind of fraction. Common fractions and decimal
fractions are based on one whole being represented by the number 1. In the case of percent
fractions, one whole is represented by the number 100. That is, one whole is 100%. Keep that in
the front of your mind as you proceed.
CHANGING FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS
Let’s start by changing a fraction to a decimal. To change a fraction to a decimal, do what the fraction
says; that is, means 1 divided by 8. Perform that division, and you get 0.125. 
Now try changing the fraction to a decimal. Does your result look familiar? It’s that repeating decimal
with which the last section ended. What do you suppose the decimal equivalent of 
is? If you
concluded that it is –0.666..., you are correct, but it’s rarely written that way. It is much more common to
see it as –0.667, or simply –0.67.

The method for changing a decimal fraction to a percent fraction is shown in the chart on the following
page.
Three things should strike you about this chart. First, the percents are all positive. How is it possible to
have a positive percent? If something goes up by a part of itself, that’s a positive increase. Yes, there are
negative percents also. If something goes down by a part of itself, thet’s a negative increase, more
commonly known as a decrease.
The second thing that should grab your attention is that 900%. You’re undoubtedly aware by now that
100% is the whole thing. But isn’t it possible to have 9 whole things? If Reese has a whole pie and
Myles has 9 whole pies, then Myles has 900% the pies that Reese has.

The third thing you should have noticed about the
chart is that five hundredths (.05) as a percent is 5%.
If you think about it, it makes perfectly good sense,
but I wanted to call your attention to the fact that 
the 0 between the decimal point and the 5
has disappeared. All leading zeroes have also
disappeared. Just in case you were unaware of the
fact before, notice that multiplying by 100 is the 
same thing as moving the decimal point two places 
to the right.
CHANGING PERCENTS TO DECIMALS
The chart at right should come as no surprise to you
whatsoever. It is the exact opposite process of that
used to change a decimal to a percent. This time, note
the necessity of placing the 0 between the decimal
point and the 9. The zeroes to the left of the decimal
points are gratuitous but aid some in reading. Please
note, also, that dividing by 100 is the same as moving
the decimal point two places to the left.

Finding a Percent 
of a Number
Adding and subtracting percents don’t really have much practical use, since each is the same as
doing so with ordinary integers. Of much more practical value is finding a percent of another
number. Practically speaking, you often need to find the percent discount at a sale (verifying that
the amount of money they’ve discounted an item corresponds to the percent discount the store’s
advertising), or what percentage of the people you’ve invited to your next party are likely to
actually show up, RSVP or not. 
To find a percent of a number, you multiply, but there is a catch. 25% of 16 is 4, but multiplying by a
percent can’t be done. What was that? Didn’t I just say that you find a percent of a number by
multiplying? Yes, but I also mentioned a catch, and this is it. There is no way to multiply a number by a
percent, but all is not as crazy as it might look. You studied, not very far back, changing percents to
decimals, and you certainly can multiply by decimals, so . . . 25% = 0.25.
Next we multiply:
Note where the decimal point was placed.
If you didn’t remember how to place the decimal point in a multiplication,
remember that you count the total number of digits to the right of the decimal
in both numbers being multiplied. This time there were two, so there must be
the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the product.
Since they were both zeroes, you can drop them and see that 25% of 16 is 4.
Find a percent of a negative number, say 40% of –80:
Next we multiply:
Again, note where the decimal point was placed.

DISCOUNTS
A discount is a percent removed from a price. If a coat lists for $120 and is being sold at 30% off, then
to find the sale price, you would find 30% of $120, which happens to be $36. Next, you would subtract
that $36 from the list price of the coat to get a sale price of $120 – 36 = $84.
Find the sale price of a $230 bicycle that is being sold at a 20%
discount:
Now we find the discount:
Finally, find the sale price: $230 – 46 = $184.
20% = 0.20 = 0.2

Understanding 
Scientific Notation
62
Scientific notation is used to write a very small or very large number as a number between 1 and
10 multiplied by 10 raised to a positive or negative power, which depends on the direction in which
you must move the decimal point. We might even call scientific notation empowering!
VERY LARGE NUMBERS
For a very large number, the decimal point is going
to be moved almost all the way to the left.
Remember, the first part must be between 1 and 10.
3,400,000 in scientific notation looks like this: 
3.4 × 106. You probably know where the 3.4 came
from, but what about the 106?
Count the number of places that the decimal point was moved to the left, and that’s where the 6 came
from. You may work out the value of 106 if you like, and you’ll see that it really works, because when
you multiply 3.4 by 106 you get 3,400,000.
Try writing 91,035,000,000 in scientific notation. Then try writing 801,600,000,000,000 in scientific
notation. Don’t look ahead until you’ve actually tried to do both of them. Cover the rest of the page so
you’re not tempted to peek.
Here are the solutions. The first one is 9.1035 × 1010. Note that the decimal point was moved to the left
10 places. In the second case, the decimal point is being moved left 14 places, resulting in a solution of
8.016 × 1014.
VERY SMALL NUMBERS
When dealing with a very small number, the decimal
point is going to be moved to the right. A popular
small measurement with biophysicists and transistor
makers is the micron, which is one-millionth of a
meter, or .000001 m. In scientific notation, that’s 
1.0 × 10–6. Count the number of places to the right
that the decimal point was moved.
The 0 is appended on the right of the first part of the numeral to justify the decimal point’s being there,
since a decimal point is never written as the last mark to the right of a numeral. Notice that when the
decimal point is moved to the right, the 10 multiplier’s exponent is negative.
Try two on your own. Express 0.000000008 and 0.000000000358 in scientific notation. No peeking!
Here are the solutions: The first is 8.0 × 10–9. I trust you weren’t fooled by the 0 to the left of the decimal
point. The second is 3.58 × 10–10.
3.400000.

very number that you have dealt with in the first
three chapters of this book has been a
constant—that is, it has a constant value. You’ve
probably heard that a rose is a rose is a rose. Well
one rose may be quite different from another rose in
color, size, fragrance, and other ways. Far truer than
that Gertrude Stein quote is a three is a three is a
three. Be it three persons, three cans of tuna fish,
three bowling pins, or three blue whales, each of
them has a certain three-ness about it that can be
represented by holding up three fingers on one
hand. That’s what makes 3 a constant. In this
chapter, I introduce a new type of number called a
variable. A variable has a temporary value in any
situation. The same variable may stand for 5 in one
problem and turn around and stand for 17 in
another. Evaluating what number a variable is worth
in any given situation is accomplished by solving
equations. This chapter affords you the chance to
become familiar with both of these.

Balance 
Pictures
68
You’ve probably seen an equal arm balance,
whether in pictures representing the scales of justice
or in a school science laboratory. Such a balance is
represented here. Each pan of this balance holds a
certain number of rolls of washers and a certain
number of loose washers. Each roll contains an
identical number of washers.
Notice that the balance is in equilibrium. That
means that the amount of weight pushing down on
each pan is the same. What you want to find out is
how many washers are in each roll. If you count
carefully, you’ll see that there are 8 rolls and 6 loose
washers on the left pan and 6 rolls and 24 loose
washers on the right one. If you remove one washer
at a time from both pans, you won’t affect the
equilibrium. In fact, as long as you do the same
thing to both pans, the balance remains in
equilibrium. (You could add the same amount to
each pan as well, but that wouldn’t suit your
purposes here.)
Here, six loose washers have been removed from
each side of the balance, leaving nothing but rolls of
washers on the left side.

chapter4
Variables, Terms, and Simple Equations
69
Suppose you start removing rolls from both sides
until you can’t remove any more without
upsetting the equilibrium. That would take you to
this situation.
From what remains, you should be able to
determine how many washers are in each roll.
Have you figured it out yet? There are 2 rolls on
the left pan and 18 loose washers on the right.
Dividing both of those quantities by 2, you can
determine that one roll contains nine washers.
I’m not sure how to break this to you, but you’ve
just solved your first algebraic equation.

Constants and 
Variables
70
FAQ 
Which letters can be used as variables?
The number of constants is infinite—without end.
The available number of variables in the
American alphabet is only 26. How could the
variables not be reused? In actuality, not all 26
letters are really available for use as variables.
The letters i and e have special meanings and
should not be used. It’s also prudent not to use o,
to avoid possible confusion with the number 0.
Defining Constants and Variables
Every number that you have ever dealt with before algebra has fallen into one category: constants. A
constant is a number that has a specific value. Whether that value is positive or negative, 5 is always
worth 5, –7 is always worth –7, and so forth. Fractions and decimals are constants, too. A percent is a
slightly different situation, because 5% of one number is not worth the same amount as 5% of another
number; however, 5% of the same number is always the same, so a percent can also be considered a
constant.
The type of number that’s exclusive to algebra is the variable. A variable is a letter that takes the place
of a number. The same variable—x, for example—may stand for one number on one occasion and a
different number on another occasion. But every time a variable appears within the same problem, it
must be worth the same amount.
The first example of a variable in this book is each roll of washers in the preceding section. There were
nine washers in each roll. Within that problem, each roll of washers was worth the same thing—as much
as nine loose washers. Of course, another time or in another problem, there might be a different number
of washers in each variable.

chapter4
Variables, Terms, and Simple Equations
71
Combining Constants and Variables
Constants and variables, as well as variables and variables, can be combined in all the usual ways in
which constants are combined with other constants. That said, the resulting combination won’t
necessarily make any sense.
There’s addition:
n + 3
4 + n
m + n
n + m
What do they mean? Well, n + 3 = n + 3, 4 + n = 4 + n. Do you get the idea? The fact that it’s possible to
write those combinations is one thing. They’ll only have meaning if you know the numerical values for
which m and n stand. 
Continuing with the combinations, there’s subtraction:
n – 3
4 – n
m – n
n – m
There’s division: n ÷ 3, but more commonly 
, 
and 
.
Did you notice that I saved multiplication for last? Think it was an accident? It never is. Until now, I’ve
used the × sign on more than one occasion, even though I mentioned earlier that it isn’t used in algebra.
That’s because we haven’t been doing algebra until now. The introduction of variables marks the
disappearance of ×. I discussed other ways to indicate multiplication in Chapter 1. Here’s where it
begins.
3n
4(n)
mn
n • m
Note that when the constant and the variable are written next to each other, as in 3n, the constant always
comes first. You will never see an expression like x8. When writing variables next to each other, as in
mn, it is customary, but not essential, to write them in alphabetical order.
mn

Coefficients 
and Factors
72
Factor is a word you’ve seen before, earlier in this book. Coefficient is probably new to you. Both
words can mean the same thing, and in some contexts do. When written in the form 2x, for
example, 2 and x are both factors of each other and coefficients of each other. Don’t let that
confuse you. It’s just the algebra devil at work!
COEFFICIENTS
When a constant and one or more variables are written next to each other to indicate multiplication, as is
the case with the expressions 3w and 5mn, the constant portion of each expression is known as the
numeric coefficient of the variable(s). Each variable is also a coefficient of the other members of the
expression. That is, w is a coefficient of 3; m and n are both coefficients of 5 and of each other. It is
customary, however, for the term coefficient to be used only when referring to the numerical part of the
expression.
Consider the variable x in the statement x = 3. What is x’s coefficient? You might be tempted to say that
it doesn’t have one, or that it’s 0. Well, you’d be incorrect in either case. If x’s coefficient were 0, then
the statement x = 3 could be rewritten as 0x = 3, which would give the left side of the expression a value
of 0. Remember, 0x means “0 times x,” and 0 times anything equals 0. That turns the statement 0x = 3
into 0 = 3, which is clearly impossible. What, then, is x’s coefficient? It’s 1. Anytime you see a variable
without a visible coefficient, it has a coefficient of 1 (understood), which brings up another peculiarity of
algebra conventions. A coefficient of 1 is never written. You’ll never see 1x or 1y. You look at this again
in a little while when you get to deal with evaluating expressions.
FACTORS
The word factor can be used in math as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, a factor is a number that is
multiplied by another number to make a third number. For example:
• 3 and 2 are factors of 6.
• 1 is a factor of every natural number, since any natural number times 1 is itself.
• The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
As a verb, to factor is to “unmultiply” something, or to break it into its component factors, while not
changing its value. Often, there are many ways to factor a number. 12, for example, factors as (1)(12),
(2)(6), and (3)(4).

chapter4
Variables, Terms, and Simple Equations
73
Variables can be used to change verbal expressions into algebraic ones. Here’s a list of some:
Verbal Phrase
Algebraic Expression
8 more than a number
n + 8 or 8 + n
the sum of a number and 5
n + 5 or 5 + n
6 less than a number
n – 6
a number diminished by 5
n – 5
6 times a number
6n
4 more than the product of 8 and x
8x + 4

Evaluating 
Expressions
74
To evaluate an expression, simply replace the variable with its value and do the arithmetic.
Sometimes it might be necessary to use grouping symbols as well.
If z = 5, find the values of:
a) z + 7
b) 12 – z
c) 3z – 5
In the case of a): z + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12
For b): 12 – z = 12 – 5 = 7
To solve c), you need grouping symbols: 3z – 5 = 3(5) – 5
15 – 5 = 10
Let’s try three more. If y = –4, find the values of:
a) y + 7
b) 12 – y
c) 4y – 7
For these, you’ll need grouping symbols for two of the three.
For a) you get: y + 7 = –4 + 7 = 3
For b): 12 – y = 12 – (–4)
12 – (–4) = 12 + 4 = 16
Finally, for c): 4y – 7 = 4(–4) – 7
4(–4) – 7 = –16 – 7 = –23

chapter4
Variables, Terms, and 
Simple Equations
75
Solving One-Variable 
Equations
An equation is a mathematical sentence. Like an English sentence, an equation is a complete
thought. Unlike an English sentence, an equation is always a true statement. If a mathematical
sentence does not express a true complete thought, it is not an equation. The verb in an equation is
the equal sign. The next several sections deal with solving one-variable equations; that is—
equations that contain only a single variable, such as x, y, or z.
Solving One-Variable Equations by Addition
You’ve seen equations and how to solve them before in this chapter, at least once. Do you remember the
balance pictures at the very beginning of this chapter? An equation works exactly like an equal arm
balance. The pivotal point of a balance is called its fulcrum. The = is an equation’s fulcrum. If you add
the same amount to both sides or remove the same amount from both sides, the equation remains in
equilibrium.
EXAMPLE 1
The key to solving equations was just stated, but I can’t stress it enough.
Consider this equation:
The main strategy for solving a one-variable equation is to get the variable by
itself on one side of the equal sign. What is currently in the way of the
variable being by itself? The 9, of course. How is the 9 combined with the
variable? Currently, it is combined with it by subtraction. The minus sign
should tell you that. How do you undo a subtraction?
The answer is to add. To undo a minus 9, add 9—but remember, whatever you
do to one side of an equation must also be done to the other side to keep it in
balance.
Completing the additions, –9 + 9 = 0, which you don’t bother to write; 
16 + 9 = 25, so the equation is solved: x = 25.
x – 9 = 16

Solving One-Variable Equations by Subtraction
Before, we added the same amount to both sides to solve the equations while keeping them in
equilibrium. These equations work a little differently, and that should be apparent as soon as you look
at them.
EXAMPLE 1
Look at this equation and find out what’s different about it.
There are actually two main differences. The first is that the 7 and the n are combined by addition
(remember, 7 + n and n + 7 mean the same thing). The second is that the variable is on the right side.
Remember, an equation is like a balance. It makes no difference which side the weights are on, only that
it is in equilibrium. Do you remember when we removed washers from each pan of the balance one at a
time? Since the 7 is added to the variable and the way to undo an addition is by subtraction, that’s what
you do.
Remember, though, that when you subtract 7 from one side of the equation,
you must do the same to the other side. That way you find that n = 14,
which is the preferred way to leave the final answer, although 14 = n would
not be incorrect.

Solving One-Variable Equations by Division
Solving equations by multiplication is a subject I’ll put off until I deal with ratio and proportion in
Chapter 5. To solve by division, however, you need to understand that the principle is identical to solving
by subtraction. After all, one definition of division, you may recall, is repeated subtraction of the same
number. Although that justifies application of the same principle as solving by subtraction, you must
keep sight of the fact that division is also defined as the undoing of multiplication.
EXAMPLE 1
Look at this equation:
How are the 3 and the y combined? By now, you should know that they are
coefficients of each other, meaning that they are connected by multiplication.
How do you undo a multiplication? Like this:
As before, what you do to one side (divide by 3), you also do to the other, thus
maintaining equilibrium.

Solving One-Variable Equations Requiring Two Steps
Realistically, you are rarely going to see equations as simple as the ones that you’ve solved so far in this
chapter. They do, however, form the basis for solving more complex equations. When solving an
equation requires more than a single step, some combination of the steps used in the preceding sections
will likely be used. In that case, it’s good to remember that if division is going to be needed, it should be
saved for last. Any additions or subtractions should precede dividing.
EXAMPLE 1
Let’s try this one: 
Since there’s a 7 subtracted from the same side as the variable, you have to
add 7 to get it off that side:
Now the variable is combined with 3 by multiplication. You know what to do
about that.
Divide both sides by 3 and find that k = 12.
EXAMPLE 2
Try one more example of an equation requiring two steps to solve.
This time, an 8 is added to the variable, so you’re going to have to 
subtract 8 to get rid of it from that side:
Now, it’s time to deal with that 7 multiplier. And, there, you have it!

Adding and 
Subtracting Variables
79
SUBTRACTING VARIABLES
Subtracting variables works the same way,
except that you subtract rather than add, so:
Similarly:
Perhaps not quite so obvious are the following situations:
Does that make sense to you? You have to remember that y is really 1 • y, so
1y + 1y = 2y. Also, 7x – 7x = 0x, which is the same as 0 • x, which equals 0.
Sure you can add and subtract variables. Soon you’ll be able to add them in your sleep. In fact, the
tendency to do so has caused me to wake up in the middle of the night, having added two variables
I hadn’t before thought possible, and yell “Eureka!” But that’s a story for a different time and
place. Besides, it’s Greek to me!
ADDING VARIABLES
Until now, you’ve had no need to add variables, so I have refrained from
going into the technique, but, to quote Lewis Carroll, “The time has come,
the Walrus said, to speak of many things . . .” or, in this case, one specific
thing. To be able to meaningfully add or subtract variables, the variable
portions of the expressions must be identical. That is:
The technique, as you can see, is to add the numeric coefficients and
not change the variable. That should not be interpreted to mean that
two different variables can’t be added, because you’ve already seen
that they can. For example, the expression 2v + 3w is perfectly
permissible, but the result of the addition is as shown at right:
Obviously, the rule of adding the numerical coefficients does not
apply here.
2r + 3r = 5r
2v + 3w = 2v + 3w
5n – 3n = 2n
7x – 3x = 4x
5y – 6y = –1y, which would be written –y
2g – 3h = 2g – 3h
5n – 4n = n
7x – 7x = 0
y + y = 2y

Changing Repeating 
Decimals to Fractions
80
Now for a brief change of pace. Changing repeating decimals to fractions would at first glance
seem to belong back in Chapter 3, but in fact, you didn’t have the knowledge at that time to have
made any sense out of it. Now you do. Chapter 3 mentioned decimals that repeat infinitely, such as
, which is 0.33333333, or 
, which stands for 0.161616.... Until now, there was no way to
sensibly change one of these decimal fractions into a common fraction. Now that you know
something about working with variables, however, you can do something about it.
Let d stand for 
or 0.7777. . . . 
Then 10d would be 
or 7.7777. . . . 
Since both d and 10d have the same decimal part, the difference between
them must be an integer:
If 9d = 7, what does that make d? Simply divide both sides of the equation by 9 
and get:
That means that 
. Cool, huh?
Try finding the fraction that means the same as the repeating decimal 
. Multiplying it by 10 isn’t
going to do it because the difference between 
and 
is not an integer. However, if 
, then
and 
. 
Now you have an integer difference between n and 100n, since both have
the same fractional part.
Then, by the process of divide and conquer, you get 
, so

Solving Equations 
Using Multiple Steps
You’ve probably suspected that this moment was coming. I have covered all the principles you’ll
need to solve multiple-step equations, save for one.
EXAMPLE 1
Look at this equation.
Variables and constants are on both sides of the equal sign, and parentheses need clearing. You learned
back in Chapter 1 that clearing parentheses takes precedence. Following that, combine like terms if
possible on either side of the equation and do whatever is necessary to collect the terms so that all the
constants are on one side of the equation and all the variables are on the other. It’s conventional to
collect all the variables on the left, but that’s entirely up to you. Finally, combine like terms again, if
possible, and solve. 
First you multiply what’s in the parentheses by –2 (yes, it looks like a minus 2, but when you have to
multiply by it, it gets treated like a –2):
9 – 3x + 11 = 16 – 2(3x – 8) →9 – 3x + 11 = 16 + –2(3x – 8)
9 – 3x + 11 = 16 – 6x + 16
Now combine the two constants on the left and combine the
two constants on the right:
It’s starting to look easier, isn’t it? You could now collect all your
terms by adding things to both sides, but I’m going to illustrate it one
step at a time, so let’s get all the constants onto the right side by
subtracting 20 from both sides:
9 – 3x + 11 = 16 – 2(3x – 8)
9 – 3x + 11 = 16 – 6x + 16
20 – 3x = 32 – 6x

Next, collect the variables by adding 6x to both sides:
Finally, divide both sides by 3.
That wasn’t so bad, was it?

Why don’t you try doing it on your own on scrap paper or
in a notebook? Then come back and see whether your
solution agrees with mine.

sides:

Multiplying and 
Dividing Variables
Now I’ll briefly complete the operations with variables topic before going on to practice.
MULTIPLYING VARIABLES
When two different variables are multiplied, the result is:
When two of the same variables are multiplied, as in x • x, the base
remains the same, but their exponents are added. For example, the
preceding equation’s product is x2.
When the variables have numeric coefficients, you multiply those
coefficients in the usual fashion:
DIVIDING VARIABLES
When variables with the same base are divided, the base remains
the same, but you subtract the exponents. If there are numeric
coefficients, they are divided:
m • n = mn
y • y2 = y3
Finally, n2• n3 = n5
2n2• 3n3 = 6n5

T
his chapter begins with axioms of equality,
which are basic truths that everyone assumes
are so without ever needing to prove them. From
there, the discussion moves on to ratios that are
algebraic comparisons between two different
quantities. In order to learn anything from ratios,
it is necessary to equate one comparison with
another of equal value. Such an equation is called a
proportion, which can be solved through the use of
cross multiplication. Just when you may think that
I’m getting ready to blow everything way out of
proportion, get ready, set. . . . If you’re waiting for
“go,” forget about it. Set is the thing you deal with
next—set theory that is. After examining special
sets and types and how to describe them, this
chapter concludes with the union and intersection—
two different ways of joining sets.

Axioms of 
Equality
88
An axiom is a logical statement or rule that is accepted as true without the need for proof, since it
is inherently obvious. For all real numbers a, b, c, and d, these are some basic rules that govern the
way in which you use the equal sign.
AXIOM OF REFLEXIVITY
The axiom of reflexivity, also known as the reflexive axiom, states that any number is equal to itself:
a = a.
This applies to variables only within a single equation or set of equations. Reflexivity applies to
constants always. 6 = 6 at all times.
AXIOM OF SYMMETRY
The axiom of symmetry, also known as the symmetric axiom, states that if one number is equal to a
second number, then the second number is equal to the first number. Stated with variables, if a = b then
b = a.
A practical application of this is if 3 + 5 = 8, then 8 = 3 + 5.
AXIOM OF TRANSITIVITY
The axiom of transitivity, also known as the transitive axiom, states that if one number is equal to a
second number, and the second number is equal to the third number, then the first number equals the
third number.
That is if a = b and b = c, then a = c.
Extending that with constants, if 3 + 3 = 6 and 6 = 4 + 2, then 3 + 3 = 4 + 2.

chapter5
Axioms, Ratios, Proportions, and Sets
89
ADDITIVE AXIOM
The additive axiom states that if the first number is equal to a second number and a third number is
equal to a fourth number, then the sum of the first number and the third number is equal to the sum of
the second number and fourth number. Maybe you’d better read that again, because it’s a mouthful.
Stated with variables, if a = b and c = d, then a + c = b + d.
Perhaps that’s better shown with constants where if 2 + 2 = 4 and 3 + 3 = 6, then 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 4 + 6.
MULTIPLICATIVE AXIOM
The multiplicative axiom states that if the first number is equal to a second number and a third number
is equal to a fourth number, then the product of the first number and the third number is equal to the
product of the second number and fourth number.
Stated with variables, if a = b and c = d, then (a)(c) = (b)(d).
Illustrating that with constants, if 2 = 2 and 3 = 3, then (2)(3) = (2)(3).
Neither of the last two axioms is very profound.

Defining and 
Creating Ratios
90
A ratio is a comparison of two different things. Ratios are used in arithmetic, algebra, and
geometry. Ratios may be written using a colon, as in a:b, or as a fraction, a/b or . Whichever way
you write a ratio, it is read as “the first quantity (or the top of the fraction) is to the second
quantity (or the bottom of the fraction). If that sounds like an incomplete statement, it is, since to
complete it would require another part, namely “. . . as a third quantity is to a fourth quantity.”
The “as” is provided by an equal sign; the third and fourth quantities are provided by a second
ratio. The two ratios with the “=” between them form what is known as a proportion. You will
work with proportions in the next section.
When it comes to ratios, order matters. a:b and b:a are two different relationships—in fact, each is the
reciprocal of the other. If Jake has five toy cars and Alex has six toy cars, the ratio of Jake’s toy cars to
Alex’s is 5:6. The ratio of Alex’s toy cars to Jake’s is 6:5.
Reese drank three glasses of juice at lunch yesterday; Myles drank five glasses of juice at yesterday’s
lunch. How does the amount of juice Myles drank at lunch yesterday compare with what Reese drank?
Hopefully, you are prepared to answer that question with . And, if the question had been “how did
Reese’s intake of juice compare with Myles’,” you’d have been prepared to answer .5

Proportions
Proportion is defined in the section dealing with ratios, earlier. As noted, a proportion is an
equating of two ratios. So, 50:70 is 5:7 is a proportion. So is 
.
MEANS AND EXTREMES
Special names are associated with the parts of a proportion. When the
ratios are written in colon form, the inner two numbers—those closest to
the equal sign—are called the means. Those farthest from the equal sign
are the extremes. You can see them in this figure.
When the ratios are written in fraction form, you have to work a
little harder to figure out which are the means and which are the
extremes, as you can see in this figure.
A very useful rule is used to solve algebraic proportions. That
rule is “the product of the means equals the product of the
extremes.” You’ll see how that works in the next section.
SOLVING PROPORTIONS BY CROSS PRODUCTS
The way you solve proportions is the model for solving all algebra problems
when faced with a fraction on either side of the equal sign. Since the product
of the means equals the product of the extremes, as you’ve just learned, then
the multiplication across the “=” has to be true, and, as you can see in this
figure, is true. 
But it’s not just true in this case. If an equation is a true statement, which it
must always be, then multiplying across the equal sign, as seen in this
figure, must always be true, since a ratio may always represent a fraction,
and vice versa. That means that anytime just a single fraction is on either
side of the equation, that equation must be a proportion and soluble by a
cross product, which is so-named for reasons that should be apparent from
this figure.

“So what does this have to do with the price of beans?”
you may well ask. Here’s a problem that hopefully will

which held 70,000. How many people can Kidd Stadium
seat? The proportion in words would be Kidd Stadium’s
seating is to Yankee Stadium’s seating as 2 is to 5:
Let n stand for the number of people that Kidd Stadium can hold. You
already know how many Yankee Stadium could hold, so the proportion
becomes:

Set 
Theory
94
A set is a group of objects, numbers, symbols, and so on. It is usually named by a single uppercase
letter and indicated by the use of braces {}. So A = {a, b, c, d} is read “Set A is the set containing
the elements a, b, c, and d.” A member of a set is known as an element of it.
is read “a is an element of Set A.”
SPECIAL SETS
A part of a set is called a subset of that set. 
Actually a set that contains 4 elements has 16 possible subsets,
namely:
Subsets taken 1 element at a time: 
{a} {b} {c} {d}
Subsets taken 2 elements at a time:
{a, b} {a, c} {a, d} {b, c} {b, d} {c, d}
Subsets taken 3 elements at a time:
{a, b, c} {a, b, d} {b, c, d} {a, c, d}
Subsets taken 4 elements at a time:
{a, b, c, d} That’s right; a set is a subset of itself. I’ll bet that
surprised you, but how about this last one? 
Subsets taken 0 elements at a time:
{} That’s known as the empty set, or null set, and is
symbolized by the Greek letter φ (phi).
The universal set is the broad category that all elements of a set are
part of. For every set shown so far on this page, the universal set is
lowercase letters of the American alphabet. For the set {c, d, 2, 3},
the universal set is lowercase letters and whole numbers.

FACT
Since the order of the elements does not matter, 
{a, b, d}, {b, a, d}, and {b, d, a} are considered
to be three forms of the same set, also known as
equal sets.

DESCRIBING SETS
Sets can be described by any of three different
methods. First, a set may be described by the rule
it must follow. For example:
That is read as “the set of v such that v is less than 97
and is a positive integer.”
Another rule to describe a set might be {all students in
the school with red backpacks}
The second way to describe a set is by roster; that is by
listing its members. Here are two examples:
The third method for describing sets is pictorially, using Venn
diagrams. You can look at these more thoroughly in a bit, when you
deal with union and intersection, but here’s a simple one: 
Notice that F is the intersection of the two circles. More about that in
a bit.
All sets fall into one of two types—finite or infinite. A finite
set has a definite number of elements; those elements can be
counted and have a definite ending point.
These sets shown here are finite.

Set Theory 
(continued)
96
An infinite set’s elements are incapable of being counted, since they go on forever, without stopping.
Here’s an example of an infinite set:
C = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
TIP
Don’t be fooled by an ellipsis of three dots (. . .). This
set looks to be infinite, but it’s not!
D = {a, b, c, d, . . .}
Set D appears to be the same as Set C, only with letters,
and there’s the problem. The set of counting numbers
(Set C) is infinite; the set of lowercase letters (Set D)
ends with “z.” 
EQUAL VERSUS EQUIVALENT SETS
As already mentioned, equal sets are sets containing the exact same
elements. Sets F and G are equal sets.
Equivalent sets is the name given to sets that contain the same
number of elements. They are sometimes referred to as sets whose
elements may be placed into a one-to-one correspondence.
Sets K and L are equivalent sets. The double-headed arrows
indicate their one-to-one correspondence, although you could
have just counted the number of elements in each.
Set F = {e, f, g, h}
Set G = {g, f, h, e}

UNION AND INTERSECTION
The union of two or more sets is a set containing all the members
of those sets. Here is a figure showing the union of two sets:
Notice that even though 6 appears in both sets A and B, which might
lead you to expect that there would be one more element in the union
than is actually present, an element is never repeated in a set. That
does not mean, though, that the 6 is lost; in fact, it’s given its own
special place. It is known as the intersection of sets A and B and is
represented as follows:
Consider the following situation:
In this case, the intersection had two elements. 
Earlier in this chapter, I promised a closer look at Venn diagrams,
so here you go. The figure to the right illustrates the intersection of
sets C and D. Notice where 
appears.
Venn diagrams are also very useful for solving certain types of
problems. Two examples follow.

Eighty students participate in one or more of three sports:
baseball, tennis, and basketball. Four students participate in all
three sports; five play both baseball and basketball, only; two
play both tennis and basketball, only; and three play both
baseball and tennis, only. If seven students play only tennis and
one plays only basketball, what is the total number of students
who play only baseball?
Check out the diagram. 22 of 80 students have been accounted
for. 80 – 22 = 58 who play baseball only. 
Here comes one more.
There are 75 students in a music program. Of those students,
many either play in the school band or orchestra or sing in the
chorus. Two of the students do all three. Fifteen of the students
play in the band but don’t sing in the chorus or play in the
orchestra. Sixteen of the students sing in the chorus and play in
the band. Twelve students sing in the chorus but don’t play in the
band or orchestra. Nine play in the band and in the orchestra only.
Two play in the orchestra and sing in the chorus only. How many
students play in the orchestra only?
56 of the 75 students are accounted for on the diagram. Study
what each section means. 75 – 56 = 19 in the orchestra only. They
must be violinists!

another 13 are needed. 9 students are in the band, but 5 of
those have already been accounted for (those in the

take neither are shown in neither circle, but complete the

onomials and binomials are expressions
containing one and two terms, respectively. 
I introduced the expression term in Chapter 4, but if
you’re not sure of its meaning, you can check the
Glossary on p. 278. Mono- means one, as in “my
wife must remain monogamous” (that’ll teach her)
or “monoplane,” which is an airplane containing a
single wing, as all modern ones do. Bi- means two,
as in bipolar (as the earth) or biplanes, which you
barely see anymore except at air shows. Monomials
may contain a single term, but that single term can
contain many parts, while binomials contain two
terms separated by a plus or minus sign. 
The rest of the chapter is largely concerned
with operations involving monomials and
binomials. The chapter builds to a crescendo with
the solving of systems of equations in two variables
by addition and subtraction as well as by the
method known as substitution.

Monomials
A monomial is an algebraic expression that consists of only a single term. A term may be a
constant, a variable, or a combination of both. 5a, 4b2, and 6x3y4 are all examples of monomials.
The key element to determining a monomial is the absence of a “+” or “–” sign.
ADDING AND SUBTRACTING MONOMIALS
When adding or subtracting monomials, the numerical
portions are added or subtracted in the same way as are signed
numbers, which is covered in Chapter 2. The variables,
however, are not changed.
To combine monomials by addition and/or subtraction, their
variable portions must be identical. Unlike the three preceding
examples:
MULTIPLYING MONOMIALS
You looked at the rules for multiplying and dividing
monomials in Chapter 1, but you only got a glimpse of
multiplying variables. The definitions and rules for
exponents and powers apply to monomials as well. 
In the same way,
In order to multiply monomials containing variable and constant components, the variables of each
type’s exponents are added together; the constants are multiplied. Here are some examples:
Notice in the second example that the exponents of the as were
added together and the exponents of the bs were added together.

The same pattern is followed here with the exponents of
j, k, and l.
Here’s one more example:
Notice that only one variable, c, is common to both monomials. 
RAISING MONOMIALS TO A POWER
In order to raise a monomial to a power,
multiply each part of the monomial by the
number to which it is being raised. Here are
some examples:
DIVIDING MONOMIALS
As with signed numbers, you’re most likely to see division represented in 
fractional notation. The fraction to the right could be read as “24efg over 8ef” 
or as “24efg divided by 8ef.” 
It doesn’t matter. Either way, to express it in simplest form requires dividing, which
entails actual division of the top numerical portion by the bottom numerical portion,
and the subtraction of the exponents of the variables on the bottom from those on the
top. For that subtraction, you’ll have to use a little imagination. That imagination
causes you to rewrite the division in a form you’ll never ever actually see.
–5j2k3l4 • –6j2k3l4 = 30j4k6l8
4abc • 7cde = 28abc2de
(x4)3 = x12

Nobody ever writes anything raised to the power
of 1, so you have to imagine that, but by doing
so, you can see how dividing monomials really
works. While the first fraction in the explanation
shows no g in the denominator, there is a g in
the denominator of the second fraction. Since
anything raised to the 0 power has a value of 1,
you can put anything you like in there raised to
the 0 power. I chose to put the g there to clarify
the rest of the explanation. 
Finishing Line 1, the numeric from the top has
been divided by that on the bottom to get 3, and
each bottom variable’s exponent has been
subtracted from the appropriate top one. So,
there are two variables raised to the 0 power and
one raised to the power 1 (Line 2). To begin
Line 3, multiplication dots have been inserted to
show what’s really going on; then, in the middle
I’ve exchanged two of the variables for their real
values and removed the exponent from the last.
Finally, everything is multiplied together to
come up with the quotient, 3g.

Binomials
110
The prefix bi- means two, so you might readily interpret the meaning of binomials to be
expressions containing two terms, separated by a plus or minus sign—the two signs not allowed in a
monomial. Binomials are the smallest example of polynomials—expressions containing many
terms. Two examples of binomials are ax + b and 3y – 7.
ADDING AND SUBTRACTING BINOMIALS
Adding or subtracting binomials may result in a
monomial, another binomial, or a polynomial. That
might sound strange at first, but these examples
should clarify it for you.
That subtraction (above right) resulted in a monomial; next:
That addition resulted in a binomial; finally
(fanfare, please):
And the subtraction resulted in a polynomial. The
defense rests.
MULTIPLYING BINOMIALS
Binomials may be multiplied by stacking them and multiplying each term of the
top one by each term of the bottom one, just as you might do in a multiplication
of a two-digit number by another two-digit number, as follows. First multiply 
by the 3:
Then multiply by the x and add:
(5y + 3) – (2y + 3) = 5y + 3 – 2y – 3
= 3y
(5x + 7) + (2x + 1) = 7x + 8
(4z2 + 3z) – (5z – 8) = 4z2 + 3z – 5z + 8
= 4z2 – 2z + 8

Notice that like variables are lined up for addition. Also notice that the
dreaded × sign was used. This is at best a cumbersome operation, and at
worst has the potential for confusion. Before you ask, the answer is, “Yes,
there’s a better way,” and it’s known as the F.O.I.L., or simply the FOIL
method. The letters stand for First Outer Inner Last. Here’s the
multiplication that you just did: 
Consider each set of parentheses both separately and together and multiply, thusly: 
First:
(2x + 4)(x + 3) = 2x2
Outer:
(2x + 4)(x + 3) = 6x
Inner:
(2x + 4)(x + 3) = 4x
Last:
(2x + 4)(x + 3) = 12
Look down the final column and get 2x2 + 6x + 4x + 12. The two middle terms can, of course, be
combined, and the result is 2x2 + 10x + 12. Does that product look familiar? It may sound like a bit
much to ask you to memorize FOIL, and what it stands for, but I assure you that after you have, you’ll
find that it was well worth the time spent doing so in the time you’ll save when multiplying binomials.
DIVIDING BINOMIALS
Although it is possible to divide a binomial by another binomial, the results
aren’t always useful. In fact, most of the time they are anything but useful.
For example:
On the other hand, a useful result can be obtained sometimes:

If you can’t see why this example is true, try multiplying (x + 4)( x – 4)
and see what you get. x2 – 16 is a special case known as the difference
of two squares. Such a case exists when each of the terms that make up
the binomial is a perfect square, and the second one is subtracted from
the first. Here are three examples of divisions of perfect squares:
In each case the solution is the same as the divisor (the term being
divided by) but with an opposite sign. Each term of the solution is the
square root of the analogous term of the dividend (the number being
divided into). 
You get a look at dividing polynomials and binomials in the next chapter
when studying factoring. You also get to look at dividing binomials by
polynomials there.

Creating Systems of
Simultaneous Equations
Up until this point, you’ve worked exclusively with equations having only one variable. In the real
world, however, this is very often not the case. Suppose Ali has a certain amount of money and
Dylan has a certain amount of money, and you don’t know what either amount is. Then you are
dealing with two different unknown quantities, or, algebraically speaking, with two variables. Call
the amount of money Ali has a and the amount of money Dylan has d. Do you see a pattern there?
Suppose that together they have $50. Then you could represent that with the equation a + d = 50.
Do you think that that’s enough information to determine how much money each of them has? It’s
not, but it’s a start. Now what if Ali has $12 more than Dylan? Algebraically, that’s a = d + 12. Will
that equation let you find the amount each has? The answer is that by itself, it will not, but taken
together with the earlier information, it will. 
Shown at right is what is known as a system of equations. They are also
known as simultaneous equations. That’s because they must be solved
together. 
The brace to the left of the equations is not essential but is there to show you
that the equations must be worked together. There are essentially three ways
of doing that. You deal with two of those ways in this chapter. The third has to
wait until you are practicing your graphing skills (in Chapter 8).
SOLVING SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS BY ADDITION OR
SUBTRACTION
To find the amount of money Ali and Dylan each has, you need to get
both variables lined up together on the same side of the equal sign. In
this case, that is easily done by subtracting d from both sides of the
second equation:
Now look at how the two equations line up. The next step is to add them
together. How can you justify doing that? Remember, what is on one side of an
equal sign has the same value as what’s on the other, and when equals are
added to equals, you may recall, the results are equal. (That’s a rephrasing of
the additive axiom, which you studied in Chapter 5.) So:

Now you have an equation with only one variable, so let’s solve it by dividing
both sides by the same quantity, 2:
Now that you’ve found the value of a, substitute that value in either
of the original two equations. Here’s the first:
So now you know that Dylan had $19 and Ali had $31. Does Ali
have $12 more than Dylan? 31 – 19 = 12, so she does. Do they have
a total of $50 between them? 31 + 19 = 50, so that’s another yes.
Try another one that’s just a little bit trickier:
This time, both variables are on the same side of the equal sign, so
there’s no work needed there. Wait a second, how are you going to
make one of those variables disappear for awhile? Well, here’s a
thought. Multiply the top equation by 2 and the bottom one by –3. That
should help make the x term disappear.
Remember that everything will change signs when multiplied by the –2.

So now you need to divide through by 5.
Now substitute what you have found into either of the original equations.
Here’s the first:
Next you multiply and subtract 12 from both sides:
Finally, divide both sides by the coefficient of x (that’s 2).
So, x = 12, and y = 4.

Solving Systems of 
Equations by Substitution
116
Addition/subtraction is a very handy way to solve certain systems of equations, but it is not always
convenient to use. An alternative method of solution is that of substitution. 
Check out this pair of equations:
Solving them by addition would be a bit cumbersome, although it is
certainly doable. On the other hand, the first equation is already solved
for x. It might not be the solution that you’d ultimately like to have, but
it is a solution; x = y + 6. Take that solution and substitute—plug—it
into the second equation:
Next, multiply through by the 3 and combine like terms:
Try one more of those. Look at this set of equations:
Sure, you could solve it by addition/subtraction, but you’d have to do some
pretty fancy moving around and multiplying. The second equation lends
itself to a quick solution, so substitution is the easier process to pursue. To
solve the second equation for p, you just need to divide by 2:
x = y + 6
3x – 2y = 21
3x – 2y = 21
3(y + 6) – 2y = 21
3y + 18 – 2y = 21
3y – 2y + 18 = 21
y + 18 – 18 = 21 – 18
y = 3

Now that you’ve found an expression that is equal to p, you
just substitute that expression into the first equation and
solve:
Now that you’ve found the value of n, you can substitute it
into the streamlined second equation:

olynomials are expressions containing many
terms. This chapter is concerned with all the
usual arithmetic operations as they apply to
polynomials, and one that might be new to you
called factoring. Factoring is separating a
polynomial (or anything else for that matter) into its
component parts. It is, if you will, the undoing of
multiplication, but it is definitely different from
division, which shares that definition. In this
chapter, you deal with factoring out (removing) the
greatest common factor, factoring the difference of
two squares, and factoring polynomials of the form
ax2 + bx + c. You’re sure to love it.

Polynomials 
Investigated
You already touched on polynomials in the last chapter. Touching them is one thing; actually
seeing them and using them is quite another. Any numeric expression containing more than one
term is a polynomial. That makes a binomial, a numeric expression that contains two terms, the
simplest form of a polynomial. A trinomial contains exactly three terms, but it’s a word that is
rarely used. Remember, terms are separated by + or – signs. (As a general practice, any expression
with three or more terms is referred to as a polynomial.) 
The most common way to write a polynomial is in descending
order. That means the power of a term decreases as you move
from left to right, for instance:
When two variables are involved, however, it is
not unusual to see the polynomial arranged
with the first variable in descending order and
the second in ascending order, as in the
equation here:
Notice that in both of the equations the lone constant came last, as is also the convention. When more
than two variables are involved, things can become confusing, as you’ll see in the section on multiplying
polynomials, later in this chapter.

Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
To add or subtract polynomials, arrange them in
columns with like terms above one another, just like
you did with binomials, except you have more terms
to worry about. Two examples are shown at right.
In the left addition, there are nothing but plus signs,
so each vertical sum is larger than either addend. In
the right equation there are two minus signs, so the
laws of signed number addition apply.

To the right is an example of
subtraction of polynomials. In order to
subtract, you first distribute the minus
sign. (It’s as if you’re multiplying
everything inside the parentheses by
–1.) Then you treat the resulting
vertical pairings as if they were signed
number additions.
It’s not always necessary to
rearrange terms in an addition
or subtraction of polynomials.
Sometimes the like pairs can
be paired up in your head, and
the results recorded.

Multiplying Polynomials
To multiply polynomials, multiply every term in one
polynomial by each term in the other polynomial. Then
simplify, if possible, by combining like terms. Of course,
if you’re dealing with a binomial times a binomial, you
can use the FOIL method that you studied in the previous
chapter. 
Here’s an example of a polynomial multiplied by a
binomial. First multiply each member of the polynomial
by 3. Then multiply each of its terms by 5x. Make sure to
line up partial products on the second line of the solution
with the terms on the first line to which they’ll be added.
Finally, add like terms.

I would guess that you get the picture from that, but let’s work
out one more. Again, start at the right and multiply each of the
top terms by –3c:
Next, multiply each of the top terms by +2b:
Starting to look a little strange, isn’t
it? Yet so far only one term is alike in
both partial product lines. Next,
multiply each of the top terms by a,
and then add:
That can be rearranged as you see at
right. The only reason for the
rearrangement is to try to bring a bit of
organization to the polynomial.

Dividing Polynomials
Polynomials can be divided by monomials and by polynomials. Essentially two very different processes
can be done in two very different ways. Here, you take a look at the simpler of those two processes first.

Polynomials 
Investigated (continued)
126
DIVIDING POLYNOMIALS BY MONOMIALS
To divide a polynomial by a monomial, simply divide each of
the terms in the polynomial by the monomial, for instance:
Note that for a polynomial to be divisible by a monomial,
each term of the polynomial must be divisible by that
monomial. Try this one to the right before you look at its
solution (below right).
Did you solve it? You could solve it in your
head by dividing each numerical
coefficient by 4 and subtracting 3 from
each exponent, or you could do what is
shown at right.
Is this what you got? I hope so.
DIVIDING POLYNOMIALS BY POLYNOMIALS
In order to divide a polynomial by a polynomial, both must
have their variable terms arranged in descending order, with
constants last. Since this is a rather esoteric process, use a
binomial divisor.
I trust you recognize the long division bracket, and that’s exactly how this process is done. It’s the
repetitive practice of divide by the first term, write the partial quotient above the first term, multiply the
divisor by that partial quotient, write the product, subtract, bring down. Does that bring back bad
memories? It does for me, too.

Start by dividing y into 3y3 and multiplying.
3y2 times y + 3 = 3y3 + 9y, which you write below the
dividend. Next, subtract and bring down.
How many times does y go into 2y2? 2y you say? So do I;
then multiply, subtract, etc.
That “etc.” was a second bring down, and a third divide, multiply, subtract; 5y divided by y is 5, which
completed the quotient. Then multiply that 5 times the divisor, write it at the very bottom, and subtract to
get a remainder of 0. Does it look strange to you that the variables in the quotient don’t line up with
those in the dividend? Feel free to move them if it’ll make you more comfortable, but it’s unnecessary.
Here’s another division with a new twist:

In case you didn’t notice, the dividend’s terms jump straight from c to
the third power to c to the first power. That is not capable of being
divided in that form. There may not be any stages missing from the
dividend, so what are you to do? The answer is to put in a second
power term that has no real value, as shown here:
Now you can go ahead and perform the subtraction. (Note the absence
of a constant is not a problem.) How many cs are there in c3? 
Next, multiply the partial quotient times the divisor, and write the
product below the appropriate members of the dividend.
Now, subtract and bring down the next term(s).
The result of the subtraction is the new partial dividend. Next, ask
yourself how many times c goes into –c2. The answer to that is –c.
Don’t take my word for it. Multiply c by –c and see what you get (pun
intended). So write that amount in the quotient and multiply it by the
divisor to get:

Finally, subtract and get a remainder of 0:
Here’s one last one:
Is there a problem here? You’re darned right there is. Both the divisor
and the dividend are listed in ascending order of the powers of h. That
will not do, but the solution is quite simple. Just turn them both around
and divide in the usual way. The steps have been worked out here.
Note that it is possible to divide polynomials and end up with a remainder.
In such a case, the remainder would be written as the last term with its sign
in front of it. Suppose, for example, that the last division had left you with a
remainder of –5. Then the quotient would have been written as this:

Factoring
130
Factoring means finding two or more expressions that, when multiplied together, make up the
initial polynomial. That might sound to you at first like division, and in its simplest form, it is.
Then it gets somewhat more complicated than that. Remember, division results in resolving a
polynomial into exactly two factors. Oops, there’s that word again. Factoring results in two or more
factors. That is a difference!
Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor
You may have noticed that factor may be used as a noun or as a verb, and it is used both ways in the
heading of this section. As a noun, a factor is one of two or more monomials that are multiplied together
to form some other expression. To factor, the verb, is to break apart an expression into its multiplication
components. 
Here is an example of factoring by removing a common
factor:
In this equation, the expression 8x3y2 + 4x4y3 has been
factored by removing the quantity 2xy. You say 2xy was
factored out of the original expression. Two questions
immediately come to mind. First, was it factored
correctly? Second, has it been factored completely? The
answer to the first question is yes, and the answer to the
second, no. It was factored correctly because when you
distribute 2xy over 4x2y + 2x3y2 you get 8x3y2 + 4x4y2. 
There is, however, still more that can be factored out, as
you see here:
You call 4x3y2 the greatest common factor, or
GCF. You may remember that expression as
having been used before, when you learned to
work with fractions. This is the same idea. A
monomial or a polynomial is factored completely
when the greatest possible monomial has been
factored out. When that monomial happens to be
identical to one of the terms in the expression
being factored, then 1 is used as a placeholder, as
in the factorization to the right:
8x3y2 + 4x4y3 = 2xy(4x2y + 2x3y2)
8x3y2 + 4x4y3 = 4x3y2(2y + x)
14ab2 + 21a2b – 7ab = 7ab(2b + 3a – 1)

chapter7
Polynomials and Factoring
131
To make certain that this factorization is correct, distribute 7ab over (multiply it times) each term in
parentheses.
Factoring the Difference of Two Squares
You’ve dealt with the difference of two squares before when you looked at FOIL, in case you don’t
recall. It was when you multiplied two binomials together and got a binomial because what should have
been the middle term dropped out. 
Following is an example of the difference of two squares and how
to factor it:
Squares and square roots are discussed in Chapter 1, just in case
you need to review the topic. x2 is a perfect square (x • x), and so is
49 (7• 7). Because a minus sign is between them (subtraction
means finding the difference), the expression x2 – 49 is known as
the difference of two squares. To factor the difference of two
squares, multiply the sum of their square roots times the difference
of their square roots. 
Try factoring these three binomials:
Did you solve them? All three? Did you pick up on my
little nasty trick? If you did—good for you. If you
didn’t, tsk, tsk, tsk!
x2 + 81 is not the difference of two squares. It’s the
sum of two squares, and as such, is not solvable.
Didn’t you notice the color difference?
x2 – 49 = (x + 7)(x – 7)
y2 – 64 =
n2 – 100 =
x2 + 81 = 
y2 – 64 = (y + 8)(y – 8)
n2 – 100 = (n + 10)(n – 10)
x2 + 81 = Are you kidding?

Factoring
(continued)
132
Try one more:
Did the 9 throw you? It shouldn’t have. It’s also a perfect
square, so:
9x2 – 121 = 
9x2 – 121 = (3x + 11)(3x – 11)
Factoring Polynomials of the Form ax2 + bx + c
To factor three-term polynomials of the form ax2 + bx + c, the first thing to do is
to see whether there’s a monomial that can be factored out. If there is, factor it out
as you did earlier in “Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor.” Then, if you’re
lucky enough to be left with a first term that begins with an x2, set up double
parentheses and factor the first term, as you see here:
The next thing to do is to determine the signs that will follow the
two variables. Look at the sign before the c term of the polynomial.
If it’s a minus, then one sign will be a + and the other a –. 
If the sign before the c term is plus, then there are
two possibilities:
To know which it is, look at the b term. A + before it means
two pluses; a – sign before it means they’re both minuses.
Finally, break the last term into two factors. If both signs are the same, the
two factors must add up to make the numerical coefficient of the b term; if
the signs are different, they must subtract to make the numerical coefficient
of the b term. Here are some examples:
(x )(x )
If –c then (x + )(x – )
If +c then (x + ) (x + ) or (x – ) (x – )
If +c and +b then (x + )(x + )
If +c and –b then (x – )(x – )
y2 + 6y – 7
(y + )(y – )
(y + 7)(y – 1)

chapter7
Polynomials and Factoring
133
Notice the – c term.
This time you were able to factor out the ax2 term’s numerical coefficient.
How could you tell that the factors of the c term were 3 and 4 instead of 12
and 1 or 6 and 2? The answer is, they had to add up to the b term, 7. And
last but not least:
That kind of threw in a new wrinkle, but remember FOIL (First Outer Inner Last). The outer terms are
2x and –5, which multiply to make –10x; when added to the product of the inners, x, the sum is –9x, the 
b term.

7 You might use the FOIL method on this multiplication, or you might recognize it as the result of
factoring the difference of two squares, in which case the solution should jump into your head. First,
factor the difference of two squares:
(z + 3)(z – 3) = z2 – 9
Now, use the FOIL approach: 
(z + 3)(z – 3) = z2 – 3z + 3z – 9 = z2 – 9
8 FOIL is the way to go:
(x – 9)(x – 3) = x2 – 3x – 9x + 27 = x2 – 12x + 27
9 And again:
(y – 5)(y – 6) = y2 – 6y – 5y + 30 = y2 – 11y + 30

0 There are three ways to solve this multiplication, but the easiest is to recognize that the second and
third binomials multiply together to form the difference of two squares, and by multiplying them
together you get another difference of two squares, so:

t’s about time for a chapter devoted to some of
the work of Rene Descartes, and the coordinate
system that bears his name, so this is it. Beginning
with a philosophical word or two, this chapter goes
on to examine the system of naming points on
coordinate axes to the graphing of linear equations
by substitution, slope and intercept, and finally to
the graphing of systems of equations such as those
studied in Chapter 6. Along the way, I deal with
finding the y-intercept and slope from the equation
of a line, finding the equation of a line from its
graph, and writing equations in point-slope form.
This chapter should certainly assist you in acquiring
a brand-new slant on life.

Philosophically 
Speaking
Rene Descartes (pronounced day-CART), March 31, 1596–February 11, 1650, was a French
mathematician, philosopher, scientist, and writer. As a philosopher, he is celebrated for his proof of
existence “Cogito ergo sum,” which means “I think, therefore I am.” As a mathematician, he is
celebrated for the invention of analytic geometry and Cartesian coordinates (pronounced car-
TEE-zhian). Descartes has alternately been referred to as the Father of Modern Philosophy or the
Father of Modern Mathematics. It is his work in the latter area to which this chapter is devoted.
Score Four
Because you exist, it stands to reason that by this point in your life, you have come across the rather
simple game known as tic-tac-toe. It is also reasonable to believe that by now, you are aware of the fact
that any game of tic-tac-toe played between two players of moderate skill should always result in a draw.
Since the game is played on a rather small grid 3 wide by 3 long, getting 3 of your mark in a row is
impossible unless you are playing a very careless or thoughtless person. Expanding the playing field and
requiring four marks in a row to win the game—now known as Score Four—is much more challenging.
In fact, Milton Bradley has turned it into a game in which red and black checkers are used as markers
and dropped alternately into a 42-slot board to Connect Four. 
Playing this game requires nothing more than a
sheet of graph paper as a playing field, with lines
ruled both horizontally and vertically at regular
intervals. The heavy ruled lines are the axes
(AX-eez) with horizontal blue and vertical red.
Unlike tic-tac-toe, which uses X’s and O’s, you
can use X’s and dots.
The location of each of the marks on the playing
board can be given by a description of where that
mark is located. In order to identify where a mark
is located on the board, count spaces across and
spaces up. The X located at A, for example, can be
described this way: (4, 2). Start your counting
where the horizontal and the vertical axes cross.

140
Since that’s where counting begins, that point is referred to as the origin. Place a fingernail or the tip of
a ballpoint pen at the origin and count lines as you move to the right, until your pointer is below the X at
A. Your pointer will have moved horizontally to 4. Now move your pointer up to the X at A. You will
have moved it vertically to 2; hence, the shorthand (4, 2). The expression (4, 2) represents the
coordinates of the X at A. That was also the first move made in this game of Score Four. 
The second through fifth moves are indicated by the other uppercase letters on the diagram in
alphabetical order. Here, we identify the coordinates of each of those points:
•B(3,1); ×C(2,2); •D(1,1); ×E(2,1)
It’s now dot’s turn. Remember that the objective of the game is to get four of your marks in a row,
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Where does dot have to go to prevent losing the game? Take your
time and think about it. When you have figured out where dot needs to go, you may look at the next
diagram.
If a dot were not placed at either F or G, then the
other player would be able to place an X, giving an
unbeatable open-ended XXX.
What are the coordinates of points F and G? Place
a dot at point G, by calling out coordinates (2, 0)
[the other option would have been (2, 3)]. But the
dot player isn’t out of trouble yet. Where should
the next X go—if the X player is on the ball?



G
F

What’s especially neat about Score Four is that the playing field’s
arrangement can be altered each time, just by shifting the locations of
the axes. See the right column for the coordinates of I and J.
The opposing player can put her dot at location I
or J. Whichever she selects, X will take the other
one for the win.

H marks the spot and completes the trap. By

Score Four with a classmate, parent, or friend.
Remember, you must name the coordinates of the
point where you wish to place your mark; no
pointing. Before any marks are made, you and
your opponent must agree that the point you
named is where your mark is being made. After
all, the purpose of this game is to learn Cartesian
coordinates (surprise!).

The Coordinate Plane
A plane is a flat surface that
continues forever in two
directions and exists in theory
only. In the real universe, a
plane isn’t possible, but for your
purposes, that doesn’t matter.
The two directions in which the
plane extends are horizontal and
vertical, which are named,
respectively, x and y. Does this
state of the plane seem a bit
familiar to you? It certainly
should. It’s the playing field for
Score Four, but it has been
extended infinitely in all
directions. Now names are
attached to the axes: the x-axis
and y-axis, respectively. Now
each and every point on the
coordinate plane can be named
by a pair of coordinates, namely
the x-coordinate and the y-
coordinate, in the form (x, y).

Think of the coordinate plane as
being separated into four
quadrants—a word meaning, of
all things, fourths. These
quadrants are marked off in the
following figure with the Roman
numerals, starting with the I in
standard position and moving
counterclockwise. 
Notice that the signs of the (x, y)
coordinates are quite predictable,
as per the scheme shown here:
I(x,y); II(–x,y); III(–x,–y);
IV(x,–y)
Keeping that color scheme in
mind, identify each of the lettered
dots in the figure by writing the
ordered pair of its coordinates, in
the form (x, y). You’ll find the
correct answers at the bottom of
this page.*

Graphing Linear Equations by Substitution
Although not 100% essential, graph paper will come in handy for use during the rest of this chapter. 
Consider this equation:
y = 2x + 3

Next, take a ruler and draw the line that is
determined by those three points. Note that while it
takes only 2 points to determine a line, having 3
ensures that the other two are correct. (If one of the
points had not lined up with the other two, you
would have known that something was wrong.)
Notice that the graph (line) of the equation is
infinite, as is represented by the arrowhead at
either end.
Philosophically 
Speaking (continued)
146
In this equation (and most others), x is known as the independent variable, while
y is the dependent one. What this means is you can substitute anything you want
for x and then find the value of y at that location. Substitute 2 for x, and see
what y is. Substitute 0 and –2 for x to get the corresponding values of y, as
shown in this figure.
Since you have, in fact, found the Cartesian
coordinates of 3 points on the (x, y) plane, plot
them on that plane, as shown here:
x

(0, 3)
(2, 7)
(−2, −1)

TIP
You’ve probably noticed how the use of x as the variable’s
name is favored when writing equations. There are a
couple of reasons for that, but the most compelling is the
ability to (and in some cases the need to) represent an
equation and its solutions on a coordinate plane.

Finding the Slope
and Intercepts
The graph of any straight-line equation has certain characteristics. Some have a y–intercept (the
point at which it crosses the y-axis), some have an x–intercept (the point at which it crosses the 
x-axis), and some have one of each. 
The line to the right has an x–intercept of (3, 0) and a
y–intercept of (0, –2). Note that each intercept has the
coordinate not the same as its name equal to 0.
Every linear equation has a slope. Slope is alternately
defined as rise over run, or the difference in ys over
the difference in xs, or by the expression 
where ∆
is the Greek letter delta, which stands for “difference.”
Note that a line with a positive slope runs from lower
left to upper right. In the figure to the right, the dotted
segments show a rise of 4 for a run of 3. That’s a slope
of . The measurements could have been made
between any consecutive or nonconsecutive points on
the line, as long as the differences between the
coordinates of the two points were clearly discernible;
that is:

Here is a figure that depicts two lines, l and m, which
are parallel to the y–axis and x–axis, respectively. Can
you figure out the slopes of those two lines? 
The equation of each line is shown in the figure. First
look at line m. Consider the differences of any two
coordinate pairs.
Finding the Slope and
Intercepts (continued)
148
This figure at right depicts the graph of a line with a
negative slope. You can remember that a line that runs
from upper left to lower right has a negative slope, or
you can measure rise over run. For a marked run of 4,
there’s a rise of –2. That’s 
or

Since all y coordinates are the same, the
difference between any two of them is
0, and 0 divided by anything is 0. 0,
therefore, is the slope of any horizontal
line.
Next check out line l. Again, use any pairs
of coordinates.
Depending on whom you ask and when
you ask them, anything divided by 0 is
considered to be either infinite or
undefined. At the time of this writing,
undefined seems to be the preferred
answer, and applies to the slope of any
vertical line.

Graphing Linear Equations 
by Slope and Intercept
150
Now that you know what slope and intercepts are, it’s time to put that knowledge to good use. 
An equation is said to be in slope and y–intercept form when it is written in the
form y = mx + b. The color coding should help you to know what each item is,
but this figure spells it all out explicitly.
Graph the equation 2y – 6 = 3x. In order to graph it, you need to
get the equation into standard form. First add 6 to each side of
the equation:
Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2 in order for y to stand
alone.
To graph the equation, first mark the y–intercept,
which is at (0, 3); remember, the b term is the
y–coordinate. The x–coordinate is automatically a 0,
since it’s a y–intercept. When the x-coordinate is
placed, use it as a starting point to count 3 up and 2
over; place a point there. Then count 3 up and 2 over;
place a point there.

Finally, using a straight-edge ruler, draw the line that
passes through those points. 
Now that you’ve seen how that works, try one
more. How about 6x = 8 – 2y? To get that into the
y = mx + b form, the easiest thing to do is to first
subtract 8 from both sides:
Next, divide both sides by –2 in order to get the y by itself and
positive:

Finally, pivot the equation around the = sign to make it look like it’s
supposed to:
Now it’s time to mark the y–intercept with a dot. Note
that the first dot goes at (0, 4). Notice also that you
counted one to the right and three down for the next
point. Could you have counted one left and three up?
Absolutely. The important thing to remember is that
since your slope is negative, it must move from upper
left to lower right—the opposite of a positive slope.

Suppose that you wanted an equation of a line that is parallel to
the one you just drew. Which of the following equations would 
fill the bill?
Equation #3 is the identical line, as you can see if you add 12 to
both sides and divide by 3. If, however, you subtract 12x from
both sides of equation #1 and divide by 4, you’ll find what is
shown at right.
How do you know that the graph of this equation is parallel to
the one in the preceding graph? It’s simple. Both equations have
the same slope. Lines with equal or the same slopes are, by
definition, parallel.
You also might find it interesting—as well as helpful—to know that
perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each
other. Which of the four preceding equations is of a line
perpendicular to both parallel lines? Well, you can eliminate
equations #1 and #3, since you’ve already discussed them. What is
the negative reciprocal of –3? The answer is at right, so you’re
looking for a line with slope . Divide through by 6, and you’ll find
that equation #4 fits the bill.

Finding the Equation 
of a Line
154
The figure at right shows the graph of line l. By
getting certain information from that graph, you can
determine the equation of line l. Not surprisingly, the
two pieces of information needed are the slope and
the y–intercept of line l. What is the y–intercept of
line l? Going to the origin and counting down from it,
you find the y–intercept is (0,–3). To find the slope,
check the graph of l for rise over run. The slope is 1. 
y
x
l
Next you need to substitute the information you just collected into the
standard equation for slope and y–intercept and, there, you have it.
y = mx + b
y = (1)x + (–3)
y = x – 3

chapter8
Cartesian Coordinates
155
Still a little nervous? Well, just in case, do one more.
Look at this figure, which shows the graph of line m.
It’s somewhat different from line l, but the method
for finding its equation is to apply the same procedure
as you did for the previous figure’s line l (see the
beginning of this section). 
Again, the data needed are the slope and the
y–intercept of line m. What is the y–intercept of line
m? Beginning at the origin and counting up from it,
you find the y–intercept to be at (0,6). To find the
slope, check the graph of m for rise over run, or in this
case, negative rise over run (fall over run). The slope
is 
.
Next you need to substitute the information you just collected into
the standard equation for slope and y–intercept:

Finding the Equation

To put this equation into a more friendly looking form, you might
multiply everything by 2. Then you would find:
At what point will this graph have an x value of 12? You could read
that as “What is the y–coordinate of the point on this graph where 
x = 12?” To find that, all you need to do is to substitute 12 for x and
solve for y:
The point is (12, –12). At what point on this graph will it
pass through y = 18? If you’re thinking “I just have to
substitute 18 for y in the equation and solve for x,” then you
have a good head on your shoulders.
So, the point’s coordinates are (–8, 18).

Writing Equations in 
Point-Slope Form
You’ve seen that given the slope and y–intercept of an equation, you can plot it or figure out the
algebraic expression of that equation. In fact, if you know both the y–intercept and the
x–intercept, you can draw the graph of the equation and figure its algebraic expression from there. 
Look at the figure to the right. The difference in the
coordinates of the two intercepts will tell you the slope.
You don’t always need to know the y–intercept of an
equation in order to figure out the equation or its
graph. Knowing the coordinates of just one point on
the equation’s graph and its slope are all the
information required when using the Point-Slope
method. 
The Point-Slope formula is derived from the formula for slope at
right:
By cross-multiplying, you get:

Writing Equations in 
Point-Slope Form (continued)

By altering that equation slightly, you derive the standard Point-Slope
equation:
Consider a line with a slope of –2 and point (3, 5) on it. Consider the
coordinates of the point to be the (x1, y1) in the preceding formula.
Substituting these values into that formula, you get:
Rearranging those terms to get the slope and intercept form,
you find:
You can see its graph in this figure.
y – y1 = m(x – x1)
y –y1 = m(x – x1)
y – 5 = –2(x – 3)
y – 5 = –2(x – 3)
y – 5 = –2x + 6
y – 5 + 5 = –2x + 6 + 5
y = –2x + 11
y
x
y − 5 = −2(x − 3)
or
y = −2x + 11

The graph of the equation is shown in the figure to the
right, as are both the Point-Slope and the slope and
y–intercept equations.
You have to be careful with those double negatives. Clear them
and then collect like terms:
chapter8
Cartesian Coordinates
159
Now use the Point-Slope formula to write the equation of the line
with slope 5 that contains the point (–3, –6). Substituting those values
into the formula, we get:
y – y1 = m(x – x1)
y – (–6) = 5(x – –3)
y – (–6) = 5(x – –3)
y + 6 = 5(x + 3)
y + 6 – 6 = 5x + 15 – 6
y = 5x + 9
y
x
y − (−6) = 5[x − (−3)]
or
y = 5x + 9
TIP
If all you have are two points on a line, it’s still
quite simple to figure out that line’s equation. Just
find the difference between the two y–coordinates
and the difference between the two x–coordinates
in the same order. 
Divide the first difference by the second, and you’ve
found the slope. Now plug the newly found slope
into the Point-Slope formula using the coordinates
of either of the two points to write the equation of
the line or to draw its graph.

To graph the first of the two equations, you can
easily rewrite it in slope and y–intercept form, as 
y = –3x +13. Its graph is shown in the figure to
the right.
Graphing Systems 
of Equations
160
You’ll recall that Chapter 6 discussed solving systems of equations by addition/subtraction and by
substitution, and I mentioned that a third method would be discussed later. Well, this is that later,
and the third method for solving systems of equations is by graphing.
Consider the following system of equations:
3x + y = 13
3y – x = 9
y
x
y = −3x + 13

That’s graphed in this figure:
Where the two graphs cross is the solution to the
system of equations. They cross at the point with
coordinates (3, 4). That means x = 3 and y = 4.
Substitute those values into either or both of the
equations and see for yourself.

Had those equations not lent themselves to being readily put into
slope and y–intercept form, you could have plotted the graphs by
substituting various values for x in each equation and then finding the
value of y at that point, as you’ll do later. Solve this pair of equations
by graphing:
The trick is to select values for x that will result in
whole number values for y. The equations are

“A
ll things being equal,” is an expression
you’ve heard and probably have used. The
fact of the matter, however, is that all things are not
equal; most are unequal, and therein lies the theme
of this chapter. Mathematics allows for the
unequalness of quantities through the mechanism of
inequalities. In this chapter, you’ll study all aspects
of inequalities, including four different strategies for
solving them as well as graphing them on both
number lines and pairs of coordinate axes. You also
look at the meaning of absolute value in
considerably greater depth than when it was first
introduced in Chapter 2. You’ll examine solving
both equations and inequalities that incorporate
absolute value, trusting that you’ll enjoy both
equally.

Introducing 
Inequalities
Over the past few chapters you’ve become accustomed to working with equations—balances in
which what is on one side of the equal sign is worth the same as what’s on the other side. Ah, if
only all things were created equal, but I’m sure you know that they are not. For those things, you
have inequalities. 
Inequalities come in four varieties:
<, meaning less than
>, meaning greater than
≤, meaning less than or equal to
≥, meaning greater than or equal to
The first two are self explanatory: 3 < 6 means 3 is less than 6, and 7 > 5 means 7 is greater than 5. They
may apply to constants as well as to variables. The last two, however, might take a bit of exploring, since
they apply primarily to variables. 5 ≤7 is an impossibility, since 5 is always less than 7 and can never be
equal to it. Similarly, impossible is the inequality 8 ≥6, since 8 can never be equal to 6. That brings us to
the two general types of inequality, true and false. The last two inequalities are examples of false ones. 
x ≥4 is a true inequality when x = 4 or anything greater than 4. Should x = 3.9 or anything less, that
inequality becomes false. On the other hand, x ≤5 is a true inequality when x = 5 or anything smaller
than 5. Should x = 5.1 or anything greater, that inequality becomes false.
All of the preceding are examples of simple inequalities. Here’s an example of a compound one: 
5 ≤y ≤9. A compound inequality is read from the middle, out. That’s going to make the color coding
used unreliable. The foregoing says y is greater than or equal to 5, and it is less than or equal to 9. Any
amount between 5 and 9 would qualify to make it a true statement. I know that’s potentially confusing,
but think about it. Since you’re starting to read it from the middle, the first part is really the reverse of
the symbol when read from the beginning.
What is the meaning of this statement?

What whole numbers are in the answer set to the preceding inequality? The second question was thrown
in to keep you from peeking at the answer to the first. It is read “x is less than or equal to 11 and greater
than or equal to 8.” Someone once suggested to view the < and > as an alligator’s jaws with the smaller
one looking to snap on the larger. Or, it might help to think of the arrowhead always pointing at the
smaller number. The answer to the question about the answer set, by the way, is {8, 9, 10, 11}. If you
think of the forward/backward logic of the way the symbols are read, you should be able to avoid (I
hope) being confused, after all less than when read left to right becomes greater than when read from
right to left.
Check out this statement:
What is the meaning of it, and what is the answer set? It’s probably easiest to
start out with the answer set, which is {. . . , –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, . . .}.
The expression, when read from the center left says “x is less than 6 and 
greater than or equal to 12.” That makes the answer set infinite in both the 
negative direction below 6 and in the positive direction 12 and above.
6 > x ≥12

Graphing Inequalities 
on a Number Line
Inequalities are most often graphed on number lines. You’re going to begin by graphing every
inequality that was discussed in the last section. 
For openers, here are the first two inequalities:
Notice that on both graphs there is a solid dot on the
position corresponding to the number mentioned in
the inequality. That solid dot represents the “equal
to” part of the is greater than or equal to in a) and of
the is less than or equal to in b). 
For contrast, look at the these graphs of x > 4 and 
x < 5. Notice the open dot on the 4 in figure a) and
on the 5 in figure b). These indicate that those
respective points are not included on the graphs. 
This graph is a bit different. It’s of 11 ≥x ≥8.
Notice that this graph is quite finite, with two solid
dots as terminating points.

See how that contrasts with almost its opposite, 
5 ≤y ≤9.
Good grief, the graph in this figure is identical to
the graph in the preceding figure except for its
position on the number line. Notice also that the
variable’s being y does not make the graph vertical.
The Cartesian coordinate system has nothing to do
with graphing these inequalities. Don’t take that to
mean that inequalities can’t be graphed on axes,
however; that’s a different story that you’re not yet
ready to deal with. 
There are two more number-line graphs that you
still need to look at. First look at the inequality 
6 > x ≥12, as graphed here.
You looked at this inequality at the end of the last
section, but look how graphing it almost brings it to
life. You can see the separation between the part that
is less than 6 and the part that is equal to or greater
than 12. Also notice that the less than 6 part has an
empty dot to show that 6 is not included on the graph. 
For the last number-line graph, consider 
4 < w < 9.
The thing that should be most noticeable about the
graph depicted in this figure is that neither 4 nor 9 is
included on the graph. For that reason, empty dots
are at either end.

Solving Inequalities by 
Adding and Subtracting
Solving inequalities is not very different from solving equations: In order to maintain the validity
of the inequality, what is done on one side of the inequality sign must be likewise done on the other. 
Look at a couple of instances, starting with this one:
In order to get the variable y alone on one side of the inequality
sign, you’ll need to subtract 11 from the side that it’s on, but if you
do that, what else must you do?
Hopefully, you said, “subtract 11 from the other side.”
And, so, you find that y is less than or equal to 4. Its
graph is shown here.
Try one more. Consider this:
This time, you’re going to need to add 8 to each side of the inequality.
You found that x is greater than 3. The graph of the
solution is shown here. 
Note that this time the dot is open, indicating that 3
is not a part of the solution set.

Now I’m going to throw in one more little wrinkle. How do you suppose you’d
solve this?
You could proceed here in two different ways, but I believe it will be
easier to understand if you first get the variable by itself, so subtract 9
from each side.
Now you know that that answer doesn’t look quite right, and the reason that it doesn’t is because the
variable is on the wrong side of the inequality sign—that is, on the right, rather than the left. Look at the
expression –2 ≥x and say what it means: Negative 2 is greater than or equal to x. Isn’t that really saying
the same thing as x is equal to or less than negative 2?
Of course it does, and that’s the answer. Looks better now, doesn’t it?
I mentioned earlier that there were two ways to solve 7 ≥x + 9. Now,
knowing what you know, look at the other way. Turn it around from the
start and then subtract 9 from each side:
The graph of the answer is shown here.

Solving Inequalities by
Multiplying and Dividing
You probably think that you already know how to solve inequalities by multiplying and dividing—
and to some extent you’d be correct. But, as you may have figured out from the last section, there
are a couple of exceptions. 
First, here is one example that you probably could have anticipated:
If you’re thinking the solution is to divide both sides of the inequality by 5,
you’d be absolutely correct.
And, so, you find that x is less than or equal to 6. Now, here’s an exception to
the expected. Look at this:
You’re probably saying to yourself, “self, what’s the problem? All I need to
do is to divide through by –4,” and up to a point you’d be correct.
Guess what? You’ve now reached that point. Because dividing by –4 is going
to change the sign of the variable, something else must also be changed.
That’s right, is greater than changed to is less than. Would you like a moment to think about that? If –4y
is greater than 12, then –y is greater than 3, so wouldn’t –y’s opposite have an opposite relationship with
3? Hopefully, that makes it a bit clearer.

Understanding 
Absolute Value
chapter9
Inequalities and Absolute Value
The discussion touched upon absolute value in Chapter 2. The distance from 0 that a number is on
the number line is known as its absolute value. It is a concept that is one of the underpinnings of
working with equations and inequalities of a higher order than you’ve dealt with to this point. 
If you look at this figure, you’ll see two points
marked with A. They are marked that way because
they both have the same absolute value, 7. The
points marked with a B both have an absolute value
of 4; those marked C have an absolute value of 2.
Read the equation to the right as “the
absolute value of negative 3 equals 3.” Of
course, the absolute value of positive 3
also equals 3. 
Now consider this:
It reads, “the absolute value of w equals 7.” What is the value of w? Does that sound like a foolish
question? Were you tempted to pick the obvious answer, 7? If you did, you’re half right. The value of w
is {–7, 7}. That’s right, w has two different values, since both 7 and –7 fit the criterion for the absolute
value of w. 
and 
. This should help to caution you to proceed carefully when it comes to
solving equations and inequalities involving absolute value.

Solving Equations Containing Absolute Value
Look at this equation containing an absolute value:
The strategy to follow is to go about getting the absolute value
by itself on one side of the equal sign by first adding or
subtracting (as needed) and then multiplying or dividing (if
appropriate). In this case you’ll start by subtracting 9 from each
side.

Next, divide each side by the 3 that the absolute value is currently 
multiplied by.
The final step is to remove the absolute value sign and set the
quantity in the bracket equal to positive 3 and negative 3.
So x = {2, 8} is the solution set. 
Try one more absolute value equation:
Following the already established strategy, first add 7 to each side.
To finish collecting terms (a way of saying get all of one type of term
on one side and all constants on the other), multiply both sides by the
reciprocal of 
.
Finally, remove the absolute value sign and set the quantity in
the bracket equal to positive 24 and negative 24.
The solution set is {18, –30}.

Solving Inequalities Containing Absolute Value
As you may have surmised, very little difference exists between the strategies used to solve equations
containing absolute value and those used to solve inequalities containing the same. The major difference
will be in the solutions and the different ways of expressing and graphing them. Since there are going to
be two different solutions, when you set the inequality <> 3, the negative of the solution, that sign must
be reversed. That is, when the inequality 
is negated and it becomes x < –3. That is, x is both
greater than 3 and less than –3.

To get the absolute value term by itself, you’ll need to subtract 5
from both sides of the inequality.
Here comes the tricky part. –7 is already
negative, so are you going to have to reverse the
inequality sign? Take a moment or two to think
about that. The answer is of course you do, but
you’ll be reversing it for the positive 7 you’re
about to create.

Inequalities 
and Half-Planes
chapter9
Inequalities and Absolute Value
When a line is plotted on a pair of coordinate axes, it divides the graph into two half-planes. If the
line is vertical, then the half-planes will be to the right and the left of that boundary; a horizontal
or oblique line will separate the graph into the half-plane above it and the half-plane below it.
When an inequality is graphed on coordinate axes, the result is always a half-plane. 
If it seems to you that what is on one side of the line must be greater than what is on the other except
when the line passes through the origin, then you are losing sight of the fact that the plane itself is
infinite in nature. Since what is on either side of the plotted line is also infinite, then those half-planes
are by extension equal in size.
When an inequality is a < or a >, then the graph will be what is known as an
open half-plane. That means that the boundary line is not included in the
solution set. To indicate that, the line is drawn dotted. To see how this works,
graph the inequality:
First you find a few values by substitution:
I chose those values because they were convenient
for me, but you could have substituted any value for
x to solve for y. You also could have drawn it using
the slope and y-intercept method. The result is
shown in the figure to the right. Note that the open
half-plane is above the boundary line, which is
dotted to show its exclusion.

When an inequality is a ≤or a ≥, then the graph will be what is known as a
closed half-plane. That means that the boundary line is included in the solution
set. To indicate that, the line is drawn solid. To see how that works, graph this
inequality:
If you consider this equation to be in the slope and y-intercept form, then its slope
is the coefficient of x, namely 1, and the y-intercept is (–3, 0). Otherwise, you
could plot a few points by the substitution method.
The solution is shown in the figure to the right. Note
that the closed half-plane is below the boundary
line, which is solid to show its inclusion.
You’ll get the opportunity to work on some of these
in the Chapter Practice, which is coming up next.

The procedure followed here is not the only possible way to solve this, but the result will be the same.
First you get the variable by itself, by subtracting 8 from each side:
6 ≥x + 8
6 – 8 ≥x + 8 – 8
–2 ≥x
Now that answer doesn’t look quite right, and the reason is that the variable is on the wrong side of
the inequality sign—that is the right, rather than the left. Look at the expression –2 ≥x and say what
it means: Negative 2 is greater than or equal to x. Isn’t that really saying the same thing as x is equal
to or less than negative 2?
x ≤–2

First, subtract three from both sides; then divide both sides by 4:
So, find that n is greater than or equal to 7. The
graph is shown here.
5 y < 4
The solution begins in a straightforward way. Both sides need to be divided by 6, but . . .
Because the sign of the variable has reversed, the
inequality sign must also be reversed. Notice that
on the graph you should have made an empty dot
at 4, since y is less than 4.

ou already dealt with fractions in Chapter 3.
Those fractions involved signed numbers. So
what makes algebraic fractions any different?
Algebraic fractions contain an algebraic expression
in the numerator, the denominator, or both. You may
be surprised to learn that certain restrictions apply
to algebraic fractions, and those restrictions stem
from the fact that division by zero is not allowed.
Look at this fraction:
What restriction is there on the value of x? The
restriction is that x cannot be = to zero; that
statement is abbreviated as x ≠0. Now consider this
new fraction:
What restrictions are there on the values of w
and y? There are no restrictions on the value of y.
However, w ≠4! (That is w cannot equal 4.) That
would make the denominator = 0, which is the same
as dividing by 0. This is only a small fraction of
what you’re going to study in this chapter.

Introducing 
Algebraic Fractions
chapter10
Algebraic Fractions
You’ve looked at some of the restrictions on algebraic fractions during the chapter introduction.
Here, you’re going to pursue that a bit further.
Look at the following fractions:
Just in case it was not clear to you in the chapter introduction, any fraction
may be considered to be a division, with the denominator being the divisor and
the numerator being the dividend, as was noted in Chapter 3. Since division by
0 is illegal—actually undoable—restrictions are placed on what the values of
the variables in a denominator can be. What can z not be in a)? To answer that
question, you need to ask yourself what when added to 3 would make 0? The
answer is –3; z may not be equal to –3 (z ≠–3).
Now look at b). What restrictions are there on the values of x and y? Since
one is being subtracted from the other, they may not both have the same value
(x ≠y). May one of them be 0? Sure, as long as both are not.
Now take a look at c). It is very different from any of the fractions you have
looked at before. In the first place, it contains an exponential term; secondly,
the two quantities in the denominator are multiplied together. If either one of
those terms were equal to 0, the entire denominator’s value would become 0.
Therefore, (a ≠0) and (x ≠0). Keep these restrictions in mind as you work
with algebraic fractions.

Simplifying 
Algebraic Fractions
200
Some books use the expression reducing fractions. That is a misnomer, in that it suggests that the
fraction is being made smaller. When simplifying a fraction, the terms in which it is expressed may
be reduced, but the size of the fraction—its value—doesn’t change. For that reason, you’ll never
see reduce used again with respect to fractions in this book. 
To simplify an algebraic fraction, look for common
factors in the numerator and denominator that may be
divided out, or cancelled. Here’s an example:
Note that 5s, xs, and ys in both numerator and
denominator could be factored (divided) out.
Sometimes it is not so evident what is the same until
some preliminary factoring is done, as in the
following:
Factoring both numerator and denominator yields the
common factor, a + 2. Sometimes, it’s not as obvious
as that. 
Here’s a for instance:
If you thought that you factored
polynomials in Chapter 7 just for fun,
think again:
And that completes the story.

Multiplying 
Algebraic Fractions
None of the arithmetic operations with algebraic fractions is any different from the same
operation with common fractions except that algebraic expressions are involved. That
involvement, however, can make things rather complicated. When multiplying, it is best to write
the results in parenthetical form and save any combining to be done for the very end. That greatly
helps to ensure that the fraction is in simplest form. It’s good policy to try to simplify the fractions
by factoring and/or canceling before multiplying the resultant numerators and denominators. 
Here are two simple examples:
These two examples involved monomials, but the
main strategies used will apply to binomials and
polynomials as well. Check out this one. It may not
be evident why the colors are used as they are, but
it will become apparent as factoring occurs.
Now there’s some canceling that can be done, to get
the result.

Dividing Algebraic 
Fractions
Dividing algebraic fractions is accomplished by changing the divisor to its reciprocal and then
multiplying. You might recall it as invert the second fraction and multiply. 
Consider this example. Color is used to distinguish numerator from
denominator.
Next, cancel if possible and multiply. Notice that the final product contains
elements from the original numerator and denominator.
Notice that the time for canceling—if the opportunity exists at all—is after
changing the divisor to its reciprocal and before multiplying. 
Let’s try a slightly more complex algebraic fraction
division. Use the same color scheme to distinguish
numerator from denominator.
Change the divisor to its reciprocal and turn the
division into a multiplication. Now it’s time to
see whether you can do some simplifying.
And finally, multiply to get a grand total of 8.

Adding and Subtracting 
Algebraic Fractions
If you’ve been wondering why I saved addition and subtraction of algebraic fractions for after you
learned about multiplying and dividing them, the answer is simple: It’s harder! If you recall, in
order for fractions to be addable or subtractible, those fractions must have the same denominators. 
Check out the following two fractions:
The denominator on the left has a 3, an x, and a y2. The one on the right has
a 2, an x2, and a y. Each contains a constant, an x, and a y. But the constants
are different, and so are the orders (or the degrees) of the variables. What
you need here is a common denominator. The least common denominator
(LCD) is 6x2y2. Go ahead and check it out for yourself; don’t take my word
for it. 
Now, to change the two original
denominators to the LCD, you have to
divide the LCD by each original
denominator and multiply its
numerator by the result. For example:
Finally, add them together.
Now wasn’t that a barrel of laughs! If there was anything you
didn’t follow, go back and check each part again. They should
fall into pace. 
Ready for a subtraction? (That was a rhetorical question.) Check this one out:
What is the least common denominator? If
you said 20xy, you are correct. Divide that
by each existing denominator and multiply
the result by the old numerators to find
what the new numerators will be.

Algebraic Fractions (continued)

Now rewrite the subtraction and solve it.
Sometimes to find the LCD it is
necessary to factor both denominators,
as is the case here: 
So what is the least common denominator? It has
to be divisible by (x – 4) once and by (x + 4)
twice. That makes it:
Divide that by each existing
denominator and multiply the result
by the old numerators to find what
the new numerators will be.
Now you’re ready to add.

T
he subject of roots and radicals was introduced
in Chapter 1, “The Basics.” Square roots have
nothing to do with square trees. In fact, they are the
opposites of numbers that are raised to the second
power. When you raise a number to the second
power, you’ll recall, you multiply it by itself. To
find the square root of a number, find the number
which, when multiplied by itself, makes that
number.
2 × 2 = 4, so 2 is the square root of 4. Although
square roots are not the only type of root in algebra,
it is by far the most often used. You can indicate
square root in algebra in several ways, but the most
common is probably by using the radical sign. I use
red here, because in the twentieth century it was the
color most often used to represent radicalism. Of
course, radicalism has nothing to do with algebraic
radicals, but I know a good thing when I see one.

211
Defining 
Roots
As previously noted, you dealt with this subject perfunctorily back in Chapter 1, but in this
chapter, you are going to take a much more in-depth look. The symbol √is called a radical sign. It
is used to designate the root of whatever number is beneath it. For example, 
is read “the square
root of 4.” Since 4 can be broken into its components like this, 
, the square root of 4
is 2. You can write that exclusively with symbols as follows: 
. 
PERFECT SQUARES
When a number has a square root that is a whole
number, that number is said to be a perfect square.
The total size of the realm of perfect squares is
infinite, but those equal to 100 or less are 1, 4, 9, 16,
25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. Can you see the
pattern? If you can’t, start by figuring out what the
square root of each of those listed numbers is. But it
doesn’t stop at squares and square roots. A number
is called a square of another based on the geometric
figure of the same name. 
Look at the top right figure, and you’ll see what I
mean.
Notice that each of the edges of the square is the
square root. The area is the actual square. 
Give the square a third dimension by adding depth.
Check the second figure out:
Here, each edge is drawn in purple, while the
volume of the figure is dark green. Each edge is the
“cube root” of the figure’s volume: 
.
CUBE ROOTS AND CUBIC NUMBERS
Notice the little 3 on the radical sign. That tells you
it is a cube root that is being represented. Suppose
the volume of the cube is 8 cubic units. Then to find
each edge you solve the following:

Roots (continued)

The first cubic number is 1. It is equal to 1 • 1 • 1, so you can properly write that 
. The next
cubic number is 8; then 27, then 64, and 125. Notice that cubic numbers get large very quickly. Cubic
numbers, unlike square numbers, have one and only one cubic root. Each square number has exactly
two square roots. “How can that be?” you ask. Well consider the following: What’s the value of 22?
“That’s an easy one,” you’re thinking; “why, it’s 4.” If that’s what you were thinking, you’re absolutely
right, but in that case, what’s the value of (–2)2? Whoa! That’s also 4. Now are you getting the idea: For
every positive square root of a number, there’s also a negative one. You could say that for any perfect
square, it’s the product of either the positive or negative value of its square root—that is, 
.
There is one additional unique property of square roots—well, make that of even-numbered roots.
Negative integers don’t have any—at least not in the realm of real numbers. The square root of –4, for
example, is imaginary. The variable i is an imaginary value that stands for 
, so the square root of –4
would be represented as 2i. You won’t look any further at imaginary numbers in this book, since it’s
really a topic for Algebra II. 
Perfect cubes can be positive or negative. The cube root of 8 is 2, and the cube root of –8 is –2. Try it. 
–2 × –2 = 4 × –2 = –8.
No convenient geometric representations exist for numbers raised to
powers greater than three, but that does not mean there are no roots
greater than cube roots. 
That is read “the fourth root of 16 is 2.”
Read that “the fifth root of 243 is 3.

TIP
There is really no limit to the “th” of the root. That
limitless number is sometimes referred to as the nth root
of a number. Those numbers that have odd-numbered
roots may be positive or negative; those with even-
numbered roots may only be positive. 

213
Operations with 
Square Roots
It is possible to perform many different operations with square roots. Some of them can be
performed under a single radical sign, while others may involve two or more radical signs. In
many respects the rules for operating with square roots follow the general rules for operating
with variables. It’s important to pay careful attention to the special rules governing the various
operations with square roots.
UNDER A SINGLE RADICAL SIGN
Notice you multiplied the two factors under the sign together to get 36
and then found the square root of that, which is 6. 
But you could have solved it a different way:
First you found the square root of 4, 2. Then you removed that 2
from under the radical sign. Next, you found the square root of 9, 3,
and removed it from under the radical sign. Note that when
something is removed from under the radical it is multiplied by
whatever was already there. Finally, you find that 2 • 3 = 6. You
wound up at the same place, but it was a bit more circuitous a route.
Next, consider addition and subtraction under a single radical sign:
Adding 40 + 24 under the radical sign gave you the square root of 64.
On the second line you took a different approach from what you did 
in the multiplication, rewriting the square root of 64 as the square 
root of 82. 
The purpose here is to emphasize that finding a square root is the same
as undoing an exponent of 2.
Here you have followed the same pattern in demonstrating subtraction
of 5 from 54 under the radical sign. This time it was 72.

Division is mostly the same here, but with a little
twist:
The note, above, is how division of radicals differs from addition and
subtraction, but not from multiplication. That is:
Last but not least, consider this:
Think about that, because at first blush you probably noticed that both 9
and 4 are perfect squares, yet they add together to make a number with no
exact square root.
WITH LIKE RADICALS
Addition and subtraction of radicals is possible only when the numbers under the radical signs are the
same. As noted earlier, in many respects the rules for operating with square roots follow the general rules
for operating with variables. This is especially true for the operations of addition and subtraction.
Consider the fact that 2x + 3x = 5x and 6y – y = 5y. 
When adding or subtracting radicals, the radicals behave as if they
were the variables, so:
The numerical coefficients are added as with the variable addition
above. The 
just names what it is that’s being added; like apples,
oranges, or x’s.

For subtraction:
Note that just as is the case with variables, a radical with no numerical
coefficient before it is assumed to have a 1 in front of it, so 
,
and is treated as such when adding or subtracting. 
Consider the following addition and subtraction:
Again, they behave in a manner identical to variables. If the
variables are not identical, you can’t add them; if the radicals
are not identical, you can’t add them. And if the variables are
not identical, you can’t subtract them; if the radicals are not
identical, you can’t subtract them.

Remember, what’s under the radical signs must be
identical or they cannot be added or subtracted.

ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF SIMPLIFIED ROOTS
Sometimes radicals do not look like they can be added or subtracted, but
they are hiding their true identities, sort of like radical wolves in radical
sheep’s clothing, for example:
At first, these look like two incompatible
radicals, until you take a closer look at the
second one. That second radical is not in its
simplest form. Factor 27, and you’ll get 
3 × 9:
Did you follow all of that? The main thing is that
How about this one?
You’ll get some more practice with these
later in the “Chapter Practice” section. The
key piece of learning to take away from this
lesson is that just because two radicals
don’t seem identical at first blush, don’t
dismiss them as different until you’ve
thoroughly analyzed the situation.
MULTIPLYING NON-NEGATIVE ROOTS
When multiplying roots that are constants, you know that negative
square roots are not allowed, so you simply proceed, as in:
When dealing with radicals containing variables, however, it is
essential to realize that the non-negative roots are the only ones
involved in the product.

Roots and Radicals

Did you remember that when both factors being multiplied are the
same variable, the exponents are added? That’s why you add 3 + 7 to
get 10. But wait, you’re not done with this yet, since you’re looking at
an even exponent under a square root sign:
So it all comes down to a5. 
Try this one:
In the first line, the 6 and 3 were multiplied
together, as were the x’s. On the second line, the
18 and 2 are multiplied together, and the x2 was
multiplied by the y4. Finally, since each member is
a perfect square in its own right, you get the final
answer: 6xy2. Answers should always be expressed
in the simplest possible form. 
Here’s one that’s slightly different,
although the principles are exactly the
same:
First, combine the first two radicals and the last two
radicals. Then combine what’s left:
Now break that down. Bear in mind that like
variables, radicals don’t need to be separated by
multiplication signs to indicate multiplication.
Putting each variable under its own radical sign
makes it easier to see which part of what’s under it
can be brought out. Then, the final step is to put it
all back together.

DIVIDING NON-NEGATIVE ROOTS
For the purposes of dividing roots, all roots are assumed to be non-negative. 
For any division of radicals, the following is true:
Any fraction with a radical sign in its denominator is by definition irrational. It is traditional and
accepted practice to never leave any fractional answer as irrational. To rationalize a denominator,
multiply the fraction by 1, in the form of its conjugate root over itself. In the case of a number whose
denominator is a pure radical, such as 
, the conjugate root would be 
. To rationalize the
denominator, multiply by that over itself (which is equal to 1), as follows: 
. Ta-da! That
was easy enough, wasn’t it? If the denominator were in the form a + √b, then the conjugate root would
be 
. 
In order to rationalize the denominator of such a fraction
without changing its value, you would proceed as follows:
You should recognize the resulting denominator as resulting
in the difference of two squares, even though a square root
was one of the contributors. 
When the denominator is of the form 
, the conjugate would be 
, and I think we can both do
without a demonstration.

For this division, solve and leave the answer with a rational denominator (where appropriate). 
The first thing to do is to simplify the
denominator:
Now it’s time to rationalize the denominator:
And that’s as far as you can go. You could also express 
that as 
.
For this division, solve and leave the answer with a rational denominator
(where appropriate). 
Here, it is beneficial to combine both y radicals into a single
fraction:
Now you’ll revert to one radical over the other.
Remember, the 8 goes with the top one:

O
kay, this is the part you’ve been waiting for—
you know, the hard stuff. (Just kidding.) Too
many people have had a difficult time with
quadratic equations because they were not properly
prepared to deal with them. If you’ve understood all
the material that has been covered so far, you should
have no trouble here. Quadratic equations contain
a term raised to the exponent 2. Each equation has
either two solutions (a positive one and a negative
one), one solution, or no solution. If it has no
solution, that means that there are no real numbers
that conform to the requirements of the equation.
There are three different ways to solve quadratic
equations, and you shall study all three of them
here—one at a time.

Standard Quadratic 
Equation Form
224
A quadratic equation is one that can be written in the form:
The a, b, and c are normally replaced by constants, but they are used
to signify first, second, and third positions in the equation when it is
in its standard form. The zero on the right side of the equal sign is
no accident either. It is part of the requirement for the equation’s
being in standard quadratic form. 
No quadratic equation ever contains a variable raised to a power higher
than two. Also, there must always be a variable raised to the exponent2,
or it’s not a quadratic equation. The + signs are a little more flexible.
Since a constant may be negative as well as positive, any of the
following may occur and still be in standard quadratic form:
You’re now going to look at a few quadratic equations that are not
in standard form. The objective will be to get every one of them
into standard form. Start out with this one:
The two problems with this equation are that the a and b terms
are reversed, and the c term is on the wrong side of the equal
sign. Reversing the first two is easy enough, and to finish the
job you’ll subtract 21 from each side.
Now look at the next quadratic:
ax2 + bx + c = 0
ax2 + bx – c = 0
ax2 – bx + c = 0
ax2 – bx – c = 0
5x + 4x2 = 21
4x2 + 5x – 21 = 21 – 21
4x2 + 5x – 21 = 0
x2 – 9 = 0

chapter12
Quadratic Equations
225
Where are the a and b terms? Well, the a term is right where it
belongs, but the b term is missing. To put it into standard form you
need to add a b term that won’t change the value of the equation.
Where’s that a, you ask? All right, I’ll put it there for you, but you’re
not going to like it.
It’s a = 1, which you never write, but which I did this time to tease
you; adding a 0x doesn’t change the value of the equation, since it
equals 0. The fact of the matter is, when solving quadratic equations
by factoring (next lesson), you love to see the minus sign and the
missing b term. You should recognize that as the difference of two
squares, which you studied earlier when you practiced factoring.
Finally, consider this equation:
This equation presents a couple of interesting choices.
You could subtract 1 + 2x2 from both sides, and then
rearrange the terms. That would give you the equation:
Or you could rearrange the terms on the right and subtract 3x from
both sides, like this:
Now, since an equation is like an equal arm balance (remember
Chapter 4), if it were a balance you’d just switch pans. In this case,
you pivot on the equal sign.
You would have gotten the same result if you had multiplied the first
equation you found by –1. Remember, you can multiply an equation
by anything without changing its value, as long as you do it to every
term.
1x2 + 0x – 9 = 0
3x = 1 + 2x2
3x – (1 + 2x2) = 1 + 2x2 – (1 + 2x2)
–2x2 + 3x – 1 = 0
3x = 1 + 2x2
3x – 3x = 2x2 + 1 – 3x
0 = 2x2 – 3x + 1
2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0

Solving Quadratic Equations 
by Factoring
226
When you studied factoring in Chapter 7, you might have thought it was just for fun, and it was at
the time. Now, however, you’re going to get the chance to put it to some use. If you don’t remember
the various forms of factoring you did in Chapter 7, go back and review it. I’ll wait. Not all
quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. Indeed, most of them cannot. But when the
opportunity is there, it should be used. 
The first thing that needs to be done is to put the equation into
standard form. I’m not going to waste your time by bothering you
with that now. You already saw it in the last lesson, so start off with
equations that are already in standard form, starting with this:
Since you went back and reviewed Chapter 7 if you felt the need to,
I’m not going to waste time or space analyzing this equation. It
factors as follows:
Next, set each of those factors equal to 0 and solve
separately.
Not surprisingly, the answers are the same, so the roots of
this equation are (–1, –1). Pretty cool eh? 
Try another one:
Does that look strangely familiar? It’s the difference-of-two-
squares equation that you played with in the last lesson, and it
is the exception to the “get it into standard form” rule. You do
remember the difference of two squares, I hope. Go for it:
y2 + 2y + 1 = 0
(y + 1)(y + 1) = 0
y + 1 = 0
y + 1 = 0
y = –1
y = –1
x2 – 9 = 0
x2 – 9 = 0
(x + 3)(x – 3) = 0
x + 3 = 0
x – 3 = 0
x = –3
x = 3

chapter12
Quadratic Equations
227
Do you know why I love writing math books? It’s because it’s so
much easier to solve equations that you’ve made up yourself. But you
probably didn’t want to know that. Try this one:
This one isn’t quite as easy to factor as the two
previous ones, but it’s not too bad. The two minus
signs should help steer you in the right direction,
as should 2, 3, and 5. 
It’s always a good idea to
check your answer by
substituting the root(s) that
you found back into the
original equation. If the root
is correct, the solution of the
equation will yield a true
statement. Here, I’ve worked
out the last solution,
substituting both roots into
the original equation.
So both roots checked out. You should go back and check out the
answers to the two previous equations.
You’ve already seen an example of a partial quadratic equation when
you worked with the difference of two squares. Here’s another
example of a partial quadratic that can be solved by factoring:
Pretty tricky, don’t you think? Go ahead and check the two answers.
You’ll see that both work.

Solving Quadratics by 
Completing the Square
228
A second method for solving quadratic equations is known as completing the square. Obviously,
it is most often used for equations that are not readily factorable. There are several steps to be
followed in completing the square, but the method can be used whether the roots are real or
imaginary. The purpose is to create a perfect square on the left side of the equal sign that can
readily be factored to form a square of the form (x + n)2 = y. At that point, x + n can be set equal
to ± y, and solved. 
The steps for completing the square are as follows:
1 Write the equation in the form ax2 + bx = –c. This time there are no exceptions.
2 a must equal 1. If it does not, divide the entire equation by a or multiply the equation by 
so that 
a = 1. Otherwise, you cannot proceed.
3 Take half of the value of b, square it, and add it to both sides of the equation. At this point, the left
side of the equation will be a perfect square.
4 Rewrite the equation as (x + n)2 = y, where y is whatever’s on the right of the equals sign.
5 Finally, split the terms from step 4 to make 
and 
and solve both for x, the
root(s).
Try one to see how it works:
First you’ll have to subtract 15 from each side.
Now there’s the matter of that a term. It’s not 1, so you need to divide
by 3.

Next, take half of the value of b, square it, and add it to both
sides.
Now it’s time to factor the perfect square you just created on the
left side.
If you’re not sure why that’s an x – 3, look at the
sign of the b term in the equation three lines up.
Finally, split both terms and solve each for the
positive and negative values of the square root of
the right side.
Substitute each root back into the original
equation to see whether it works.
That works for me!
Try one more of those. How about:
First you need to rewrite the equation, subtracting 21 from
both sides.

Next, you have to do something about that . The solution is to 
multiply everything by its reciprocal, .
Now take half of the value of b, square it, and add it to both
sides of the equation.
Now it’s time to factor the perfect square you just created on the
left side.
Finally, split both terms and solve each
for the positive and negative values of the
square root of the right side.
I’m going to leave it to you to check that problem, because I want to
do something that you are probably going to find insane—until you

I presume that it looks familiar, so get to it. You need to divide each
term by a.
Next, take half the b term’s coefficient, square it, and
add it to both sides.
To combine the terms on the right side of the equals
sign, you’ll need to combine both fractions over the
common denominator 4a2. 
That is:
Next, factor the perfect square that you’ve made on the left side of the equation and split the roots to
solve for their positive and negative values.

Well, it should be obvious that you can combine those fractions,
since the denominators are the same, and you’ll end up with the
same fraction on each side, except one radical will be added and the
other subtracted. Why not combine those as well, to get:
That may seem to you like a lot of work, and it was, but it was all worthwhile, as you’ll see on the next

Now I’m going to ask you to do something you’re not
going to like. It is essential that you commit the
quadratic formula to memory. Everybody else who has
taken algebra has done it, and there is no reason why
you can’t. I recommend the following mantra: “x equals
negative b plus or minus the square root of b2 minus
4ac, all over 2a.” Say it to yourself while commuting to
school or work, and while you’re trying to go to sleep at
night, until it comes to you automatically whenever you
see a quadratic equation.

Solving Quadratic 
Equations by Formula
You’ve seen the quadratic formula, 
, and seen how it is derived by completing
the square. You’ve been working feverishly to memorize it and are continuing to do so, if you
haven’t already memorized it. Now it’s time to see how to use it. 
Start out with this one:
That means that a = 6, b = –2, and c = –20.
Next, write the quadratic formula, with the caveat that you’re
solving for m rather than x.
Now, you’re going to substitute the values, being
certain to transfer their signs, when necessary. In
other words, if the number has a negative sign, that
sign should be transferred with the value, as in the
case of c in this equation.
Next, combine what you are able to combine.

Simplifying 484, you find it’s divisible by 4.
You might recognize 121 as the square of 11, so:
Now separate the two values of m and solve:
Now wasn’t that fun?
You’ll do one more solution by quadratic formula in a bit, but first consider a part of the formula. The
portion under the radical sign is known as the discriminant. It has already been noted that there are
three possibilities for the solutions to a quadratic equation. Using the discriminant, b2 – 4ac can tell you
in advance what those roots’ properties will be. 
1 If b2 – 4ac < 0, then there are no real roots.
2 If b2 – 4ac = 0, then there is exactly one real root.
3 If b2 – 4ac > 0, there are two real roots.
Consider the equation you just solved. If you look back, you’ll see that the discriminant was equal to 
484. What does that tell you? Sure enough, the roots were 2 and 
; two roots, both real.
You’ll get more practice with the use of the discriminant in the next section.

ore than for any other reason, algebra exists to
solve problems. More students of algebra
have difficulty with word problems, however, than
with any other aspect of algebra. Figuring out what
solution you are supposed to be finding, selecting
the information you need, and finally creating an
equation that leads you to the proper answer can
be difficult. In this chapter, I’ll try to help you to
dissect word problems so that what is being asked for
becomes apparent. Sometimes too much information
is provided, and you’ll need to distinguish between
what is relevant and what is not. I’ll also try to help
you to recognize words and phrases that indicate
which algebraic or arithmetic operations are to be
used. Finally, you’ll practice many different types of
word problems. Pay close attention to the words, and
they shouldn’t cause you any problems.

Techniques for Translating
Problems into Equations
Word problems, also called story problems, are the most practical application of algebraic skills.
In your everyday life, whether at home or work, problems arise that need to be thought through
and acted upon. It is very unlikely that you’ll ever have a practical use for a quadratic equation
solution—unless you’re a physicist or a chemist—but you may encounter word problems every day.
How to Tackle Algebraic Word Problems 
• The first trick to solving an algebraic word problem is to read the problem through once, just to get
an idea of what it’s about. Then go back and analyze the problem to determine what information
you’re being asked to find. Some teachers suggest that you circle that information on the page. Let
your variable equal whatever it is you’re seeking to find. Remember that the variable represents a
number rather than a person, place, or thing. 
• Often, drawing a picture will help—not a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, but a pencil sketch with
stick figures. A chart or table of values may also be helpful. These should help to point you in the
direction that you should be going and even suggest an equation to lead you to the solution.
• If you can, write an equation that will lead to the solution. Key words and phrases in the problem
should help lead you to that equation. You’ll look at key words and phrases in the next section.
Make sure that you don’t take extraneous information from the problem and use it in your equation.
Sometimes extra information is included in an attempt to confuse you. Be aware of that so you don’t
fall for it.
• Solve the equation carefully, making sure to check your work as you go. Then see whether the answer
you got is the solution to the problem. Sometimes the variable you’ve found will only be part of what’s
being asked for.
• Make sure that your answer makes sense in terms of its magnitude and units and the other
magnitudes and units in the question. For example, if the problem was about hundreds of miles
and your answer is in tens of inches or pounds, that should be a hint that something is wrong. 
TIP
One of the most common errors made when solving
word problems is failing to answer the question that the
problem actually asked. Turn the question you were
asked into a statement and substitute into it the answer
that you found to see whether it works. If the statement
makes sense, then you probably solved it correctly.

As you work word problems, you’ll discover more words
that imply or suggest particular arithmetic relations or
operations. Remember to be aware of what the question is
asking, such as: How fast . . .? How far . . .? How many . . .?
How heavy . . .? How much . . .? How old . . .? What
percent . . .? Find the ratio. . . . What part of . . .? and so
forth.

Types of 
Problems
The problems you are going to study are grouped into types for ease of understanding. Probably
the most logical place to start is with number problems, since they relate pure numbers, and there
are no other units to worry about. Every solution to a word problem should begin with a “Let
statement” that tells what you are letting the variable stand for. 
It is always preferable to solve a word problem using an equation with a single variable if it can
be done that way. All of the word problems in this book can be solved in terms of one variable.
Number Problems
1 Two numbers sum to 20. Twice the first number equals
three times the second. Find both of the numbers.
It’s pretty obvious that what you are looking for here
are two numbers. Start the solution to this problem
with a Let statement (see right). You could let the
variable n stand for either the first or the second
number. Since the second number is multiplied by a
larger amount than the first, I’d recommend letting n
stand for the second number. How do you decide what
the first number should be? The answer to that is in the
first sentence of the problem, “Two numbers sum to
20.” If they sum to 20, then 20 minus the second must
equal the first.
Since the Let statement was derived from the first sentence, you
can’t use it to write the equation. The numbers would simply
cancel out. Instead, use the problem’s second sentence. Read it
again, and you’ll see that it says what is written in equation form
to the right.
Let n = the second number.
Then 20 – n = the first number.
2(20 – n) = 3n

Next, solve the equation for n.
Did you think to go on after finding that n = 8? I’ll bet you
that some people didn’t. You have to remember that the
problem asked you to find two numbers. Try another one.
2 When 7 times a number is increased by 9, the result is 37.
This is a pretty easy one, because you’re only looking for one
number, but don’t get cocky. Start out with the Let statement.
7 times the number is increased by 9. That translates to:
When 7 times the number is increased by 9, the result is 37. This
last phrase translates to the = sign and the specified quantity.
To solve, subtract 9 from each side and then divide by 7.
Does the answer make sense? 7 times 4 is 28 and add 9 to that and
get 37. Yep.

Consecutive Integer Problems
There are essentially three types of consecutive integer problems. They are consecutive integers (1, 2, 3,
etc.), consecutive odd integers (1, 3, 5, etc.), and consecutive even integers (2, 4, 6, etc.).
1 The sum of three consecutive integers is 60. Find the numbers.
As always, start with the Let statement.
Now go back to the problem to construct the equation.
Next, combine like terms by addition.
Since n =19, n + 1 = 20, and n + 2 = 21. Do they add up
to 60? Check and see.
2 The sum of three consecutive even integers is 48. What are
they? See the right column.
Now go back to the problem to construct the equation.
Let n = the first integer.
Then n + 1 = the second.
Then n + 2 = the third.
n + n + 1 + n + 2 = 60
(n + n + n) + (1 + 2) = 60
3n + 3 = 60
3n + 3 – 3 = 60 – 3
3n = 57
n = 19
Let n = the first integer.
Then n + 2 = the second.
Then n + 4 = the third.
n + n + 2 + n + 4 = 48

Types of Problems 
(continued)
248
Solving this equation does not take a genius, but be careful.
So, n = 14 , n + 2 = 16, and n + 4 = 18.
3 Twice the smallest of three consecutive odd integers is 1
more than the largest. Find the integers. 
The first thing that may surprise you is the Let statement.
It’s the same as for three consecutive even integers. Do you
get why? Even integers are two apart, and odd integers are
also two apart.
Now, the equation is going to be a bit different.
The problem reads twice the smallest (that’s 2n) is (that’s =) 1
more than the largest (that’s n + 4 + 1). Next, solve it.
So, n = 5, n + 2 = 7, and n + 4 = 9. Is twice the smallest 1 more
than the largest? You bet it is.
3n + 6 = 48
3n + 6 – 6 = 48 – 6
3n = 42
n = 14
Let n = the first integer.
Then n + 2 = the second.
Then n + 4 = the third.
2n = n + 4 + 1
2n – n = n – n + (4 + 1)
n = 5
Age Problems 
Age problems are another type of word problem that uses primarily numbers, but which introduces a
unit of age, usually years. Your mother may have been 20 when you were born, but when you were 5,
she was 5 times as old as you, and five years later she was 3 times as old as you. This changing
relationship between the ages of two persons is the basis for some interesting word problems! When
considering the meaning of an age problem, remember to keep track of the aging going on between both
of the subjects. Remember: A year from now, whatever the relationship between our ages now, I’ll be
one year older, and so will you.

1 Frank is three times older than Reese. 5 years ago, Frank was 8 times Reese’s age. Find their ages now. 
A table would come in handy here.
The problem says that 5 years ago Frank’s age
was 8 times Reese’s. Therein lies your equation.
Once you’ve found Reese’s current age, it’s not
very difficult to find Frank’s. Now what did the
problem ask for? Checking back, it asks for their
ages now.
2 Ian is twice as old as Myles. Jake is 4
years younger than Myles. In two years
the sum of all of their ages will be 58.
How old are they now? Again, a table
would be most helpful (see right). Since
all the ages seem to be keyed to Myles’,
let’s use an m as the variable.
The equation is to be found in the third sentence of the
problem. Read it and then see the equation to the right.
Once again, the solution is nothing much, but be
careful not to get mixed up with all the ms and 2s.
That makes Myles 14, Ian 28, and Jake 10.

4m + 2 = 58
4m + 2 – 2 = 58 – 2
4m = 56

Distance and Motion Problems
This is the first type of problem in which drawing a
diagram might do you some good. This is also the first
type of problem that can be referred to as formulaic.
That is, there is a standard formula to be followed for
most situations. Either straight or in some variation, that
formula is shown at right:
1 An automobile travels 42 km at a speed of 84
km/hr (that’s kilometers per hour). How long
did it take?
The problem tells you the distance and the rate
(speed); what you need to find is the time.
Next, substitute what you know into the equation.
It took the automobile 
hour. Does that make sense? The car was
traveling at twice the km per hour as the distance it traversed, so it
does make sense.
2 Rocio left New York City at noon and drove west
on I-80 at 60 miles per hour. Kira left New York
City an hour later and drove west on I-80 at 70
mph. Both continue to drive without stopping and
at the same speeds. At what time will Kira catch
up to Rocio, and how far will each have driven?

A table will definitely help.
The I-80 information is gratuitous and was thrown in to
confuse matters. The times that the two of them drive are
different. So are their speeds, but when Kira catches up to
Rocio, both will have driven the same distance, and that’s
how you get the equation to the right:
Notice that you started by equating distances and ended up finding
the time. There it is. t = 7 hrs. Does that answer the question? Well, the
question was at what time did Kira catch up. A look at the chart will
show you that t represents Rocio’s time, and she left at noon, so noon +
7 hours makes it 7 P.M. That answers part of the question. The second
part is how far each has driven. The easier equation to solve will be
for Rocio.
And now you’ve answered the questions that were asked.
Rate ...r

–10t = –70
t = 7
d = rt
d = 60 • 7
d = 420 miles
Coin Problems
Coin problems involve nickels, dimes, quarters, and occasionally half dollars and pennies. They all tell
you something about the total number of coins, the relationships in quantities of each type of coin, and
the total value of the coins. It is then your job to find out how many coins of each type are involved.
1 Tania has a number of coins totaling $3.00. She has twice as many dimes as quarters and 5 more
nickels than dimes. How many coins of each type does she have?

Types of Problems 
(continued)
252
There are three procedures to follow when working with coin problems. 
Work in terms of pennies, so a nickel is worth 5 cents rather than $.05, a dime is worth 10 cents,
and $3.00 is 300 cents. 
Always pick the smallest quantity to be the variable. In this case, that would be the quarters. 
Always make good use of a table. You might have noticed by now that a table is nothing more than
a fancy form of a Let statement: 
Now you’re ready to put together an equation based on the
total value of Tania’s coins.
Finally, combine terms and solve for the number of
quarters.
Now that you have the number of quarters, 5, you
know there are twice as many dimes, or 10, and 5
more nickels than that, or 15 nickels. You figure out
whether that makes $3.00.

2 Sebastian has 102 coins in quarters and dimes that total $21.00. How many of each coin does he have?
Remember the three procedures you followed last time, as you construct the chart. You can let either
coin be the variable. Use d for dimes. If d stands for dimes, how many quarters are there?
Now you’re ready to put together an equation based on the
total value of Sebastian’s coins.
Next, collect like terms and combine them to
solve for d.
So there are 30 dimes. How many quarters
are there? Well, since 102 – 30 = 72, that was
an easy one!

Mixture Problems
Mixture problems deal with having two or more
kinds of things mixed together, be it solutions of
different concentrations, nuts in a can that sell for
two (or more) different prices, more expensive
and less expensive coffees, etc. 
There are generally two matters of consequence
in dealing with mixtures. They are the amount of
each and the value or concentration of each. After
both of these are considered, the result is the
mixture of those items combined.

How many fl. oz. (fluid ounces) of each should be used in order to end up with 50 fl. oz. of a 60%
sodium hydroxide solution?
Two things should be pointed out here. First of all, .5
and .6 could have been used in place of .50 and .60,
respectively, in the last column. The superfluous zeroes
were kept to avoid confusing you. The second thing to
note is the last column contains the equation you need to
solve. Just rewrite that addition in horizontal form.
Now, proceed to combine like terms and to isolate the
variable.
That’s 20 fl. oz. of Solution 1 and 30 fl. oz. of Solution 2.

Work Problems
Work problems consider the situations in which two or more people work together to complete a single
job. The general pattern is, for example, one person can do a job working alone in three hours, which
means that person could do one third of the job in an hour. A second person could do the job working
alone in 2 hours, which means that person could do one half of the job in an hour. A third person working
alone could do the job in 4 hours, which means that person could do one fourth of the job in an hour. How
long would it take to do the job if they all worked together? 
The solution to this type of problem takes the following form:
Use the figures from the first paragraph and substitute them into this formula—omitting the “etc.” this time.
In order to combine those fractions, you need a common
denominator, the least of which happens to be 12. With that in mind,
convert all three fractions to 12ths.

Next, cross-multiply and solve for x.
That means that the three of them working together could finish the
job in that fraction of an hour.
Suppose Amy, working alone, could paint her entire house in 3 days,
Beth (even though she’s not feeling well) could paint it alone in
6 days, and Jo alone would take 9 days (admittedly, they’re little
women). How long would it take them to paint the house if they
all worked together? Based on what you just learned:
The least common denominator for the three fractions is 18;
therefore, convert and combine.
Finally, cross-multiply and solve for x.

1 When 8 times a number is decreased by 7, the result is 49. What is the number?
Let x = the number. 
8 times the number, decreased by 7, translates to:
8x – 7 = 49
Now collect and combine like terms to solve that equation:
Does the answer make sense? 8 times 7 is 56; subtract 7 from that and get 49. That works.

sum of the smallest and largest (that’s n + n + 4) is 13 greater than the middle one (= n + 2 + 13):
n + n + 4 = n + 2 + 13
Next, solve it.
2n + 4 = n + 15
2n – n + 4 – 4 = n – n + 15 – 4
n = 11
n + 2 = 13
n + 4 = 15

7 The second integer is triple the smallest, and the largest is triple that. They sum to 208. Find the
integers. 
Let x = the first integer.
Then 3x = the second.
Then 9x = the third.
The equation is quite straightforward:
x + 3x + 9x = 208
13x = 208
x = 16
3x = 48
9x = 144
8 Carmen is four times older than Mariel. 6 years ago, Carmen was 7 times Mariel’s age. Find their
ages now. 
A table is needed here.
Girls
Ages Now
Ages 6 Years Ago
Carmen
4m
4m – 6
Mariel
m
m – 6
The problem says that 6 years ago Carmen’s age was 7 times Mariel’s. Therein lies your equation:
4m – 6 = 7(m – 6)
4m – 6 = 7m – 42
7m – 42 = 4m – 6
7m – 4m – 42 + 42 = 4m – 4m – 6 + 42
3m = 36
m = 12
4m = 48

30a + 16 = 4a + 64 + 4
30a – 4a + 16 – 16 = 4a – 4a + 68 – 16
26a = 52
a = 2
30a = 60
Alex is 2; his grandfather is 60.

Note that since Anna is 6 years younger than Ali, Ali is 6 years older than she. The equation is to be

x + 3 + 2x + 9 + 2x + 3 = 50
(x + 2x + 2x) + (3 + 9 + 3) = 50
5x + 15 – 15 = 50 – 15
5x = 35
x = 7
2x = 14
2x + 6 = 20
That makes Marcello 7, Anna 14, and Ali 20.

# Andy left Chicago at 9 A.M. and drove south on a four-lane highway at
a steady 40 miles per hour. Fil left Chicago a half hour later and drove

The essential part to remember is that when Fil catches Andy, both will have driven the same
distance; that’s how you get your equation:
2.5 hours added to Andy’s starting time of 9 A.M. yields a catching up time of 11:30 A.M.
You still need to find the distance driven:
d = rt
d = 40 • 2.5
d = 100 miles

Form the equation by setting the two distances equal to each other; after all, both buses traveled the
same distance.
7r = 5.5(r + 12)
7r = 5.5r + 66
7r – 5.5r = 5.5r – 5.5r + 66
1.5r = 66
r = 44
r + 12 = 56
They were traveling at 44 and 56 mph, respectively.

You’re looking for a time when the total distance between them will be 675 miles, so:
45t + 60(t – 1) = 675
45t + 60t – 60 = 675
105t – 60 + 60 = 675 + 60
105t = 735
t = 7
That’s 7 hours, even.

Now you’re ready to put together an equation based on the total value of Melissa’s coins:
5x + 20 + 20(x + 4) + 25x = 400
Remember, everything’s in terms of pennies.
5x + 20 + 20(x + 4) + 25x = 400
5x + 20 + 20x + 80 + 25x = 400
50x + 100 = 400
50x + 100 – 100 = 400 – 100
50x = 300
x = 6
Now that you have the number of quarters, 6, you know there are 4 more nickels, or 10, and twice as
many dimes as nickels, 20.

So there are 10 nickels. How many quarters and dimes are there? Well, since he has half as many
nickels as quarters and dimes, he must have twice as many of those. That’s 20 of each.

Y
ou might think of a function as the natural
expected operation of something—as in the
digestive system of a human being, which (when
performing properly) functions to convert food to a
form that can be absorbed by the body. A function
may also be an event that one is required to attend
in the course of his or her daily work. In fact, a
function can be very many things, except in
mathematics. Algebraically speaking, a function is
a relation between a dependent and an independent
variable. Some, but not all, equations are functions.
You will take an in-depth look at them in the pages
that follow. In this chapter, you also look at a
relationship known as variation, which comes in
two distinct forms—direct variation and inverse
variation. Frédéric Chopin wrote many variations
for the piano, but that’s another story.

Function 
Machines
You don’t have to understand what a function is in
order to use a function machine; one is shown in the
figure to the right.
The box represents an input that is going into the
hopper on the function machine. Inside the
machine, invisible to you, some action is performed
on that input. Eventually, out the chute comes the
triangle, which represents the output. By comparing
input and output, you should be able to figure out
what the machine has done. Perhaps it will be
clearer to you if you see a table of inputs and
outputs.
Each input has produced a distinct output, as you
can see by reading each line of the table from left to
right.
Does any single line of that table provide
more useful information than every other
line? Do you want a moment to think
about that? The most useful line is the one
in which the box number is 0. Where did
the triangle number 3 come from? The
only way it could have gotten hooked
onto an input of 0 is by addition. So now
you know the following:

Since you know that the triangle number 3 was
added onto the box number, subtract that from each
triangle number. That gives you the 1 column in
this figure: 
Compare the box numbers with the triangle1
numbers and see whether you notice anything. 
Does that make sense to you? Every number in the
triangle 1 column is twice as big as the box number
on the same line. That should lead you to
the conclusion that each box number is
being multiplied by 2.
Now try putting some box inputs into the hopper of
a different function machine. This machine looks no
different from the last one, but inside the machine, a
different action is being performed on that input.
The table of inputs and outputs is shown at right.
What’s the first thing you noticed? Hopefully, you
noticed a box number of 0 brought about a triangle
number of –4. What does that mean for the new
function machine?

Now that you’ve found that a negative 4 was added
(or a 4 was subtracted, take your pick), find out
what else the machine did by adding that 4 back on
in the triangle 1 column. 
You should now readily recognize how the box
numbers and the 1 number are related to each
other. That relationship should point the way to the
missing element in the relationship of input to ,
and is shown in the equation at right:
Would you like to try one more? Well, ready or not,
here it comes. Check out this table of inputs and
outputs from one more function machine:
You might have noticed something different about
this table. Unlike the earlier ones, it does not consist
of consecutive values for the box numbers. Does that
change anything about how you go about solving it?
The short answer is “not really.” Since there is a
triangle number value for the box number 0, 
you can conclude that 6 is being added to
each box number. That makes the form of
the equation look like what you see at right:
Since every triangle number contains an added 6,
the next step is to remove it in order to see what’s
left. That’s been done in the 1 column in the figure
at the right:
Now, since you’re probably more comfortable with
positive values than with negative ones, check out
the relationship between ❑2 and ❑4 and their
respective 1 values. Did you figure it out? Each
is one and one half times the other, so the multiplier
is as shown to the right:
How cool was that?!

Relations and 
Functions
BC6
Before you take an in-depth look at functions, you need to understand a couple of other definitions
and look at a few examples that should help to demystify the meaning of functions. The first
needed definition is a relation. A relation is a connection between two things. In algebra it is a
connection between two variables. It may be shown in many different ways. Most often it is shown
as an ordered pair, as a point on a graph, or as an equation. 
P = {(–3, –4), (–4, 2), (4, 3), (2, –3)} is a set of
ordered pairs. The same set of ordered pairs is
shown in this figure.
All of the possible input values of a relation are
known as the relation’s domain. The usual way to
think of domain is as the independent variable in a
relation. All the x values is another way to think of
domain. It is every number that you can put into an
equation or formula and get a real number as an
answer. The domain of P, above, is the set 
{–4, –3, 2, 4}.
All of the possible output values of a relation
constitute the relation’s range. The usual way to
think of range is as the dependent variable in a
relation. All the y values is another way to think of
range. It is every number that you can possibly get
out of an equation or formula after every possible
input has been used. The range of P, above, is the
set {–4, –3, 2, 3}.
All that brings you to a special type of relation, the function. A function is a
relation in which each input can have one and only one output. That may
sound like a no-brainer if you don’t stop to think about it, so here’s an
example of a nonfunction:
y
x
y2 = x2 + 4

BC7
That is obviously a relation; the equals sign takes care of that. So why is it
not a function? Consider a few inputs and their corresponding output values:
Now do you see the problem? Each square number has two roots, a negative one
and a positive one. (–2)2 = 4, just as (2)2 does. On the other hand, y = x + 3 is a
function. The table to the right shows why:

TIP
You’ll note that for any one input, there is only one
output. That is what makes this relation a function. In a
function, each member of the domain may be paired
with exactly one element of the range. All functions are
relations, but all relations are not functions.

Graphs of 
Relations
BC8
The graph shown to the right is of a linear equation.
Is it a function?
Since for every x value there is one distinct y value,
it IS a function. Now examine the remaining graphs
on this page and identify which are functions and
which are not.

y = 2x + 2
y

BC9
The last three graphs are all nonfunctions. More
than one y value exists for some or all x values. All
other graphs are functions with each x value having
a distinct y value, although in the figure solving 
y = x2 + 2 (shown at left) that might not be at once
obvious.

Function 
Notation
BC10
Function notation is usually a lowercase italic letter next to parentheses enclosing another lower-
case italic letter or a number, such as f(n). This notation is read as “a function of n,” or “f of n . . . ,”
the ellipsis of three dots standing for whatever comes next. f is the most commonly used letter,
simply because it is the first letter in the word function, but any lowercase italic letter would
suffice, such as g(x), h(z), or p(q). 
Before you get all upset about this new
form of notation, realize that practically
speaking, the set of function values is
usually the same as the set of the ranges of
any set of ordered pairs. For example, look
at this set:
Now by referring to the set, I find that f(–3) = –2;
read “Ef of –3 is –2.” Along those same lines, f(–1)
= 0. Similarly f(1) = 3, f(3) = 5, and f(5) = 7.
Suppose the following (see right):
Using exactly the same principle as earlier,
determine the values of g(8), g(6), and g(–2).
Respectively, they are g(8) = 13, g(6) = 8, and 
g(–2) = 2. 
Now you are going to practice with a variable in this soup. Consider this
function:

h(x) = 3x + 1

BC11
Find each of the following: h(–2), h(3), and h(7).
Remember that you are dealing with a function of x. In order to find
h(–2), substitute –2 into the equation in place of x.
For the second one, substitute 3 into the function.
Finally, substitute 7 into the function.
So, how is this different from substituting a value into an equation? The
easy answer is, it really isn’t. That’s because most equations you deal
with—but not all of them—are functions. In fact, if you wanted to graph
the function h(x) = 3x + 1, you would substitute a y for the h(x).

h(x) = 9 + 1
h(x) = 10
h(x) = 3x + 1
h(x) = 3(7) + 1
h(x) = 21 + 1
h(x) = 22

Variation
BC12
A variation is a relationship between one set of variables and another set of variables. Three types
of variations are possible: direct variation, inverse variation, and by far the rarest form, joint
variation. Joint variation is a topic for Algebra II, so it will not be covered here.
Direct Variation
The phrase “y varies directly with x” or “y is directly proportional to x” is
represented as shown at right:
That strange squiggle reads varies as. This representation, however, is not
especially useful. To make it more useful, as well as solvable, rewrite it as an
equation.
k is known as the constant of variation, or the constant of proportionality.
They are two different names for the same thing. You may think of it as the
standard slope-intercept form.
You’ve simply substituted a k for the m, and the value of b is 0. That brings you
back to the form y = kx. If any two of those values are known, it is possible to
determine the third. For example, if you don’t know the value of k, but do know the
values of x and y, you can solve for k as shown at right:
Try working through the solution of a direct variation problem: y
varies directly with x when x is 3, y is 5. What’s the value of y when
x is 12? 
First, you need to find the constant of variation, so:
y ∝x
y = kx
y = mx + b

x

BC13
Next, you substitute that constant of variation and the new x value into the
basic equation and solve it for y.
Do you see another way in which that could have been solved? Well, the bottom
line is you could have set up a proportion, like this one:
Substitute:
Now cross-multiply and finally divide:
Graph the variation:

Did you notice that the graph passes through the
origin (0, 0)? Every direct variation always passes
through the origin. That’s because an input of 0 is
always going to get an output of 0. Think about it.
You’ll get the chance to practice some more of these
in the “Chapter Practice,” coming up right after one
more topic.

Inverse Variation
Inverse variation is also known as indirect variation. As one variable gets larger, the other gets
smaller. Another way of saying the same thing is, “y is inversely proportional to x.” That is as x
increases, y decreases and as x decreases, y increases. 
The basic representation for an inverse variation is:
That is, y varies as the inverse of x, hence its name. The basic equation for an
inverse variation is:
You already know what k is called. If the objective is to find the value of the
constant of variation, you can use the rewritten form of the formula to the right:
y

"
y

=
k = xy

BC15
When you’re looking to find a new value of x or y or the original value of x or y,
use the inverse proportion:
By multiplying the means by the extremes, you get the following handy-dandy
and very useful formula:
Needless to say, whether direct or inverse, although I’ve been demonstrating
using the ever-convenient variables x and y, any variables may be used.
Here’s an example. If p varies inversely with q and p is 4 when q is 7, find the
constant of variation. Start with the second formula above for finding the constant
of variation:
Of course, you’ll need to make a slight adjustment:
Next, substitute:
So the constant of variation is 28.
Try another one. If m varies inversely with n and m is 18 when n is 4, find
the value of m when n is 6. Rewrite the inverse proportional formula:
Next, substitute the values:
Finally, multiply and then divide both sides by 6:
So m is 12.
Note that as n’s value went up, m’s went down. That’s why it’s an inverse
variation.
