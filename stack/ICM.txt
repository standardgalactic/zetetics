1. Introduction
In algebraic geometry, one of the most important dichotomies is the one between
characteristic 0 and positive characteristic p. Our intuition is formed from the
study of complex manifolds, which are manifestly of characteristic 0, but in num-
ber theory, the most important questions are in positive or mixed characteristic.
Algebraic geometry gives a framework to transport intuition from characteristic
0 to positive characteristics. However, there are also several new phenomena in
characteristic p, such as the presence of the Frobenius map, which acts naturally
on all spaces of characteristic p. Using the Frobenius, one can formulate the Weil
conjectures, and more generally the theory of weights. This makes many results
accessible over ﬁelds such as Fp((t)), which are wide open over ﬁelds of arithmetic
interest such as Qp. The theory of perfectoid spaces was initially designed as a
means of transporting information available over Fp((t)) to Qp, but has since found
a number of independent applications. The purpose of this report is to give an
overview of the developments in the ﬁeld since perfectoid spaces were introduced
in early 2011.
2. Qp vs. Fp((t))
To study the transition between characteristic 0 and characteristic p, it is useful
to look at the corresponding local ﬁelds. In characteristic 0, we have the ﬁeld of
p-adic numbers Qp:
Qp = {
X
n≫−∞
anpn | an ∈{0, 1, . . . , p −1}} ,
∗This work was done while the author was a Clay Research Fellow.

which can be regarded as ’power series in the variable p’. On the other hand, one
has the actual ﬁeld of power series in the variable t:
Fp((t)) = {
X
n≫−∞
antn | an ∈{0, 1, . . . , p −1} = Fp} .
Although these two ﬁelds have formally ’the same’ elements, the basic addition
and multiplication operations are diﬀerent: In Qp, one computes with carry, but
in Fp((t)) without carry. Also, t 7→tp deﬁnes the Frobenius map of Fp((t)), but
there is no map Qp →Qp that sends p to pp.
There are several strategies to pass from one ﬁeld to the other. Let us recall
the most important ones.
Letting p →∞. In model theory, one can formalize the idea that Qp becomes
isomorphic to Fp((t)) as p →∞.
This has the following implication: A ﬁrst-
order statement is true for almost all ﬁelds Qp (for varying p) if and only if it is
true for almost all ﬁelds Fp((t)). The ﬁrst application of this was the Ax-Kochen
theorem, [4], that a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in more than d2 variables
admits a solution over Qp, except for a ﬁnite list of primes p (which depends
only on d). In fact, the same result is true over Fp((t)) for all p. However, there
are counterexamples to the general statement over Qp, such as a quartic form in
18 variables over Q2 without a solution. More strikingly, this transfer principle is
used in the proof of the fundamental lemma: Ngˆo, [52], has proved the fundamental
lemma over Fp((t)) (for suﬃciently large p), which could then be transferred to
Qp, if p is suﬃciently large.1
However, this strategy cannot be used to get information about any ﬁxed prime
number p. One of the ways in which one wants to compare two ﬁelds is to compare
the categories of ﬁnite extension ﬁelds. This is encapsulated by the absolute Galois
group GK = Gal(K/K) of a ﬁeld K, where K is some separable closure of K. If
K is a local ﬁeld such as Qp or Fp((t)), it comes with a decreasing ramiﬁcation
ﬁltration
GK ⊃G(0)
K = IK ⊃G(1)
K = PK ⊃G(2)
K ⊃. . . ;
here, PK ⊂IK ⊂GK are the wild inertia, resp. inertia subgroups. The ’tame
quotient’ Gtame
K
= GK/G(1)
K = GK/PK admits an explicit description, and PK is
a (not very explicit) pro-p-group.
Restricting ramiﬁcation. From the explicit description of Gtame
K
in the case
of local ﬁelds, one knows that Gtame
Qp
∼= Gtame
Fp((t)) canonically. In other words, there
is a canonical procedure to associate to a tame extension of Qp a tame extension
of Fp((t)). This result can be strengthened if one passes to extension ﬁelds. More
precisely, for any n ≥1,
GQp(p1/n)/G(n)
Qp(p1/n) ∼= GFp((t))(t1/n)/G(n)
Fp((t))(t1/n) .
This is a result of Deligne, [21], relying on ideas of Krasner, [49], which formalizes
the idea that Qp(p1/n) and Fp((t))(t1/n) are ’close local ﬁelds’ (which get ’closer’ as
1One does not need model theory to do this, as Waldspurger, [66], had earlier shown this
transfer principle for large p directly.

n →∞). Note that, again, this result plays a crucial role in the Langlands program,
namely it is used (through Henniart’s numerical local Langlands correspondence,
[37]) in the original proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GLn over Qp
by Harris-Taylor, [34].2
There is yet another approach, which gives a comparison of the whole Galois
group.
Making things perfect(oid). Let K = Qp(p1/p∞) = S
m Qp(p1/pm), which
we will momentarily confuse with its completion, which has the same absolute
Galois group GK. Then a theorem of Fontaine-Wintenberger, [32], states that the
absolute Galois groups of GK and GFp((t)) are isomorphic. This can be considered
as a limit case of Deligne’s theorem as one lets n = pm, m →∞. Indeed, note
that as Fp((t))(t1/pm) is a purely inseparable extension of Fp((t)), GFp((t))(t1/pm) ∼=
GFp((t)). In fact, if one lets K♭be the completion of
Fp((t))(t1/p∞) =
[
m
Fp((t))(t1/pm) ,
then the theorem of Fontaine-Wintenberger states equivalently that GK ∼= GK♭.
This theorem is one of the foundational cornerstones of p-adic Hodge theory. More-
over, it is true in a wide variety of cases: Any ’deeply ramiﬁed’ extension of Qp
can be used in place of Qp(p1/p∞).
Note that the last approach gives the cleanest result: It works for any ﬁxed p,
and produces an isomorphism of the whole Galois groups. However, it comes at
the expense of passing to inﬁnite extensions. The theory of perfectoid spaces is a
generalization of this procedure to higher-dimensional objects.
3. The (generalized) Fontaine-Wintenberger isomor-
phism
To start, let us explain the general statement of the Fontaine-Wintenberger iso-
morphism.3
Deﬁnition 3.1. A perfectoid ﬁeld is a complete topological ﬁeld K, whose topol-
ogy comes from a nonarchimedean norm | · | : K →R≥0 with dense image, such
that |p| < 1 and, letting OK = {x ∈K | |x| ≤1} be the ring of integers, the
Frobenius map Φ : OK/p →OK/p is surjective.
Examples include the completions of Qp(p1/p∞), Qp(µp∞), Qp and Fp((t))(t1/p∞),
Fp((t)). Note that perfectoid ﬁelds can be of characteristic 0 or p. In the ﬁrst case,
2The alternative proof given in [57] avoids this argument, and gives a proof of the local
Langlands correspondence for GLn over Qp which is purely in characteristic 0.
3It should be noted that the original result of Fontaine-Wintenberger is quite diﬀerent, at least
in emphasis. The theorem as stated was only proved recently, and was noticed independently (at
least) by Kedlaya-Liu and the author.

they contain Qp naturally, as |p| < 1. Note that Qp is not a perfectoid ﬁeld (al-
though Zp/p = Fp has a surjective Frobenius map), because | · | : Qp →R≥0 has
discrete image 0 ∪pZ ⊂R≥0. In characteristic p, perfectoid ﬁelds are the same
thing as perfect complete nonarchimedean ﬁelds.
By a construction of Fontaine, one can take any perfectoid ﬁeld K, and produce
a perfectoid ﬁeld K♭of characteristic p, called the tilt of K. First, one deﬁnes
OK♭= lim
←−Φ OK/p, and then deﬁnes K♭as the fraction ﬁeld of OK♭. It comes with
a natural norm, with respect to which OK♭⊂K♭is the ring of integers. In fact,
one has the following alternative description of K♭.
Lemma 3.2. There is a natural identiﬁcation of multiplicative monoids
OK♭= lim
←−
x7→xp
OK = {(x(0), x(1), . . .) | x(i) ∈OK, (x(i+1))p = x(i)} , K♭= lim
←−
x7→xp
K .
In particular, x 7→x♯:= x(0) deﬁnes a multiplicative map K♭→K, and the norm
|x|K♭= |x♯|K on K♭.
Proof. Let us only check the ﬁrst identiﬁcation. For this, one has to verify that
the projection map
lim
←−
x7→xp
OK →lim
←−
x7→xp
OK/p = OK♭
is bijective. Indeed, any sequence (¯x0, ¯x1, . . .) ∈lim
←−x7→xp OK/p lifts uniquely to
(x(0), x(1), . . .), where
x(i) = lim
n→∞]
¯xi+n
pn
,
where e¯xj ∈OK denotes an arbitrary lift of ¯xj ∈OK/p. The existence of this
p-adic limit follows from the basic fact that if a ∼= b mod p, then apn ∼= bpn
mod pn+1.
As a basic example of the tilting equivalence, the perfectoid ﬁeld K which is
the completion of Qp(p1/p∞) tilts to the perfect nonarchimedean ﬁeld K♭which is
the completion of Fp((t))(t1/p∞). Under the identiﬁcation
K♭= lim
←−
x7→xp
K ,
the element t corresponds to the sequence (p, p1/p, p1/p2, . . .). In particular, t♯= p,
so in a vague sense, the map x 7→x♯is the map ’replace t by p’.
However,
calculating it in general involves a p-adic limit, so e.g.
(1 + t)♯= lim
n→∞(1 + p1/pn)pn .
This already shows that any general theory of perfectoid objects has to be of an
analytic nature.
Theorem 3.3 ([47, Theorem 3.5.6],[58, Theorem 3.7]). Let K be a perfectoid ﬁeld.

(i) For any ﬁnite extension L/K, L is a perfectoid ﬁeld.
(ii) The association L 7→L♭deﬁnes an equivalence between the category of ﬁnite
extensions of K and the category of ﬁnite extensions of K♭.
It is formal to deduce from part (ii) that the absolute Galois groups GK ∼= GK♭
are isomorphic.
4. Untilting: Work of Fargues-Fontaine
The following question arises naturally: For a given perfectoid ﬁeld L of character-
istic p, in how many ways can it be untilted to a perfectoid ﬁeld K of characteristic
0, K♭∼= L? The answer to this question leads naturally to the Fargues-Fontaine
curve, [30], [31]. In particular, they prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1. Fix a perfectoid ﬁeld L of characteristic p.
There is a regular
noetherian scheme XL of Krull dimension 1 (locally the spectrum of a princi-
pal ideal domain) over Qp whose closed points x are in bijection with equiva-
lence classes of pairs (K, ι), where K is a perfectoid ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and
ι : L ,→K♭is an injection which makes K♭a ﬁnite extension of L; here, the pairs
(K, ι) and (K, ι◦Φn) are regarded as equivalent for any n ∈Z. The degree [K♭: L]
is called the degree of x. Moreover, there are (inﬁnitely many) points of degree 1.
In particular, one can always untilt a perfectoid ﬁeld L to characteristic 0, and
the ways of doing so are parametrized by a 1-dimensional object. Note that if,
e.g., L is algebraically closed, then all points are of degree 1 and have algebraically
closed residue ﬁeld. However, the curve lives only over Qp, and thus is not of ﬁnite
type over Qp. Concretely,
XL = Proj
M
n≥0
B+(L)ϕ=pn ,
where B+(L) is one of Fontaine’s period rings, a certain completion of W(OL)[ 1
p].
A point of XL gives rise to an ideal I ⊂W(OL)[ 1
p] (well-deﬁned up to the action
of Frobenius), and the corresponding perfectoid ﬁeld of characteristic 0 is given by
K = W(OL)[ 1
p]/I. This gives an explicit description of untilting in terms of Witt
vectors.
The work of Fargues-Fontaine has further connections with the theory of per-
fectoid spaces that we cannot explain in detail here, for lack of space, cf. [29]. For
the rest of this article, we will usually ﬁx a perfectoid ﬁeld K in characteristic 0,
which amounts to ﬁxing a point ∞∈XK♭of degree 1.
5. Perfectoid algebras
Deﬁnition 5.1. A perfectoid K-algebra is a Banach K-algebra R for which the
subring R◦⊂R of powerbounded elements is a bounded subring, and such that

6
Peter Scholze
the Frobenius map Φ : R◦/p →R◦/p is surjective.
The simplest example is R = K⟨T 1/p∞⟩for which R◦= OK⟨T 1/p∞⟩is the
completion of OK[T 1/p∞] = S
m OK[T 1/pm]. In other words, perfectoid K-algebras
are algebras with ’lots of (approximate) p-power roots’. Note that perfectoid K-
algebras are always quite big, e.g. nonnoetherian; also, no ’smallness’ hypothesis
is imposed. The mixture of completeness and nonnoetherianity might cause big
trouble (as, e.g., completions of nonnoetherian algebras are not in general ﬂat)!
However, it turns out that the ’bigness’ condition of surjective Frobenius forces
good behaviour.
One can apply Fontaine’s construction to any perfectoid K-algebra. This de-
ﬁnes the tilting functor: Let R be a perfectoid K-algebra. Set
R♭◦= lim
←−
Φ
R◦/p = lim
←−
x7→xp
R◦
which is a OK♭-algebra, and
R♭= R♭◦⊗OK♭K♭= lim
←−
x7→xp
R .
Proposition 5.2 ([58, Theorem 5.2]). Fix a perfectoid ﬁeld K with tilt K♭.
(i) For any perfectoid K-algebra R, the tilt R♭is a perfectoid K♭-algebra with
subring of powerbounded elements R♭◦⊂R♭.
(ii) The functor R 7→R♭deﬁnes an equivalence between the category of perfectoid
K-algebras and the category of perfectoid K♭-algebras.
Note also that for any perfectoid K-algebra R, one has a continuous multiplica-
tive map R♭→R, f 7→f ♯.
6. Perfectoid Spaces
As remarked earlier, any theory of perfectoid objects has to be of an analytic
nature. This reﬂects itself algebraically in the fact that perfectoid algebras are
Banach algebras. On the level of spaces, it means that we have to work in some
category of nonarchimedean analytic spaces. The classical such category is Tate’s
category of rigid-analytic spaces, [64], but strong ﬁniteness assumptions are built
into the foundations of this theory. There are (at least) two more recent approaches
to nonarchimedean analytic spaces: Berkovich’s analytic spaces, [8], and Huber’s
adic spaces, [40]. We choose to work with Huber’s adic spaces, because we feel
that it is the most natural framework; e.g., it interacts well with the theory of
formal models. Moreover, one glues spaces along open subsets, which is at least
technically convenient.4
Following Huber, we make the following deﬁnition in the perfectoid world:
4Somewhat more importantly, most examples of perfectoid spaces arise as ’inverse limits’ of
classical ﬁnite type spaces. The general topos-theoretic notion of inverse limit developed in SGA4

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications

Deﬁnition 6.1. A perfectoid aﬃnoid K-algebra is a pair (R, R+), where R is a
perfectoid K-algebra, and R+ ⊂R◦is an open and integrally closed subring.
The role of the integral subalgebra R+ is certainly secondary, and one may
safely assume that R+ = R◦on ﬁrst reading.
Proposition 6.2. The association (R, R+) 7→(R♭, R♭+) with
R♭= lim
←−
x7→xp
R , R♭+ = lim
←−
x7→xp
R+
deﬁnes an equivalence between perfectoid aﬃnoid K-algebras and perfectoid aﬃnoid
K♭-algebras.
To a pair (R, R+), Huber associates a space of continuous valuations.
Deﬁnition 6.3. A valuation on R is a map |· | : R →Γ ∪{0}, where Γ is a totally
ordered abelian group (e.g., Γ = R>0, but higher-rank valuations are allowed),
such that |0| = 0, |1| = 1, |xy| = |x||y| and |x + y| ≤max(|x|, |y|). The valuation
| · | is continuous if for all γ ∈Γ, the subset {x ∈R | |x| < γ} ⊂R is open.
There is an obvious notion of equivalence of valuations, and one deﬁnes Spa(R, R+)
as the set of equivalence classes of continuous valuations |·| on R such that |R+| ≤1.
For a point x ∈Spa(R, R+), we denote by f 7→|f(x)| the associated valuation.
One may ﬁnd back R+ as
R+ = {f ∈R | |f(x)| ≤1 ∀x ∈Spa(R, R+)} .
One equips Spa(R, R+) with the topology generated by rational subsets: For
f1, . . . , fn, g ∈R which generate R as an ideal, the subset
U(f1, . . . , fn; g) = {x ∈Spa(R, R+) | |fi(x)| ≤|g(x)|} ⊂Spa(R, R+)
is a rational subset.
Proposition 6.4 ([38, Theorem 3.5]). The space Spa(R, R+) is a spectral space.
In particular, it is quasicompact, quasiseparated, and the rational subsets form a
basis for the topology consisting of quasicompact open subsets, stable under ﬁnite
intersections.
Again, one ﬁnds an interesting relation under tilting.5
Theorem 6.5 ([58, Theorem 6.3 (i)]). For any x ∈Spa(R, R+), one may deﬁne
a point x♭∈Spa(R♭, R♭+) by setting |f(x♭)| := |f ♯(x)| for f ∈R♭. This deﬁnes a
homeomorphism Spa(R, R+) ∼= Spa(R♭, R♭+) preserving rational subsets.
requires coherent topoi, and adic spaces have an underlying coherent topological space, as well as
a coherent ´etale topos. This makes the machinery of SGA4 available, which gets crucially used in
many applications. Berkovich spaces have compact Hausdorﬀunderlying spaces, which are not
coherent.
5A closely related result was proved earlier by Kedlaya, [46].

It is a priori not clear that f 7→|f ♯(x)| actually deﬁnes a valuation, as the
strong triangle inequality might fail because of nonadditivity of f 7→f ♯. Moreover,
injectivity of Spa(R, R+) →Spa(R♭, R♭+) is not clear as one only remembers the
valuation on the image of R♭→R, which is far from dense. However, there is the
following crucial approximation lemma.6
Lemma 6.6 ([58, Corollary 6.7 (i)]). Assume K is of characteristic 0. Let f ∈R
be any element, and ﬁx any ϵ > 0. Then there exists g ∈R♭such that for all
x ∈Spa(R, R+),
|(f −g♯)(x)| ≤|p|1−ϵ max(|f(x)|, ϵ) .
This means in particular that |f(x)| = |g♯(x)| except if both are very small.
However, f −g♯may be quite large if f is large.
One wants to equip the topological space X = Spa(R, R+) with a structure
sheaf OX. For this, let U = U(f1, . . . , fn; g) ⊂X be a rational subset. Equip
R[g−1] with the topology for which the image of R+[ f1
g , . . . , fn
g ] →R[g−1] is open
and bounded. Let R⟨f1
g , . . . , fn
g ⟩be the completion of R[g−1] with respect to this
topology; it comes equipped with a natural subring
R⟨f1
g , . . . , fn
g ⟩+ ⊂R⟨f1
g , . . . , fn
g ⟩.
Proposition 6.7 ([39, Proposition 1.3]). The pair
(OX(U), O+
X(U)) =

R⟨f1
g , . . . , fn
g ⟩, R⟨f1
g , . . . , fn
g ⟩+

depends only on the rational subset U ⊂X (and not on the choice of f1, . . . , fn, g ∈
R). The map
Spa(OX(U), O+
X(U)) →Spa(R, R+)
is a homeomorphism onto U, preserving rational subsets. Moreover, (OX(U), O+
X(U))
is initial with respect to this property.
The propositions of Huber so far have not used the assumption that R is per-
fectoid. This assumption is needed, however, to prove that OX is actually a sheaf.
Huber proved this when R is strongly noetherian, so e.g. if R is topologically of
ﬁnite type over K. Perfectoid K-algebras are virtually never (strongly) noetherian,
so this result does not help.
Theorem 6.8 ([58, Theorem 6.3]). Let (R, R+) be any perfectoid aﬃnoid K-
algebra with tilt (R♭, R♭+). Let X = Spa(R, R+), X♭= Spa(R♭, R♭+). For any
rational subset U ⊂X, let U ♭⊂X♭be its image under the homeomorphism
X ∼= X♭.
(i) The presheaves OX, OX♭are sheaves.
6A slightly stronger version (replacing 1 −ϵ by p/(p −1) −ϵ) appears in [47].

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
9
(ii) For any rational subset U ⊂X, the pair (OX(U), O+
X(U)) is a perfectoid
aﬃnoid K-algebra, which tilts to (OX♭(U ♭), O+
X♭(U ♭)).
(iii) For any i > 0, the cohomology group Hi(X, OX) = 0 vanishes.
In fact,
Hi(X, O+
X) is almost zero, i.e. killed by the maximal ideal of OK.
The resulting spaces Spa(R, R+) (equipped with the two sheaves of topological
rings OX, O+
X) are called aﬃnoid perfectoid spaces (over K). Objects obtained by
gluing such spaces are called perfectoid spaces over K.
Corollary 6.9. The categories of perfectoid spaces over K and over K♭are equiv-
alent. Here, if X tilts to X♭, then the underlying topological spaces of X and X♭
are canonically homeomorphic. Moreover, a subset U ⊂X is aﬃnoid perfectoid if
and only if U ♭⊂X♭is aﬃnoid perfectoid. For any such U, (OX(U), O+
X(U)) is a
perfectoid aﬃnoid K-algebra with tilt (OX♭(U ♭), O+
X♭(U ♭)).
For any perfectoid space X, one may deﬁne its ´etale site X´et.
Theorem 6.10 ([58, Theorem 7.12, Proposition 7.13]). Under tilting, X´et ∼= X♭
´et.
Moreover, if X = Spa(R, R+) is aﬃnoid perfectoid, then H0(X´et, O+
X) = R+
while Hi(X´et, O+
X) is almost zero for i > 0. In particular, H0(X´et, OX) = R while
Hi(X´et, OX) = 0 for i > 0.
The assertion X´et ∼= X♭
´et is a far-reaching generalization of the Fontaine-
Wintenberger isomorphism. Indeed, if we put X = Spa(K, OK), which tilts to
X♭= Spa(K♭, OK♭), the assertion is precisely the Fontaine-Wintenberger isomor-
phism. The assertion about Hi(X´et, O+
X) is a strengthening of Faltings’s almost
purity theorem, which is essentially the version of it for the ﬁnite ´etale site. Let
us state it in our setup.
Theorem 6.11 ([58, Theorem 7.9 (iii)]). Let R be a perfectoid K-algebra, and
let S/R be ﬁnite ´etale. Then S is a perfectoid K-algebra, and S◦is a uniformly
almost ﬁnite ´etale R◦-algebra.
The following is an easy corollary, which gives a higher-dimensional variant of
the Fontaine-Wintenberger isomorphism (for the ﬁnite ´etale case).
Corollary 6.12. Let R be a perfectoid K-algebra with tilt R♭. Then tilting deﬁnes
an equivalence between the categories of ﬁnite ´etale R-algebras and ﬁnite ´etale R♭-
algebras.
The almost purity theorem is interesting only in characteristic 0; in charac-
teristic p, it is easy. Originally, Faltings proved such statements in situations of
good reduction, [23], and then more generally in certain situations of semistable
(or more generally toric) reduction, [25]. We note that in Faltings’ situation, R
was the completion of an inductive limit of regular algebras. Then, by Zariski-
Nagata purity, the ramiﬁcation locus of S◦over R◦is purely of codimension 1.
We know by assumption that there is no ramiﬁcation in characteristic 0, as S/R
is ﬁnite ´etale. At the generic points of R◦/p, it follows from (the proof of) the

10
Peter Scholze
Fontaine-Wintenberger result that there is almost no ramiﬁcation. If there were
none, one would get that S◦/R◦is ﬁnite ´etale. Faltings made the same argument
work in the almost world. It came as a surprise that no regularity assumption is
needed for the theorem.
Faltings’ almost purity theorem was the technical cornerstone for most of the
deep work in p-adic Hodge theory, as it provided a higher-dimensional variant
of the Fontaine-Wintenberger isomorphism. The given generalization made many
new applications possible, of which some are explained below.
7. Example: Projective spaces
Let us start with an explicit example of the tilting equivalence. Let K be a per-
fectoid ﬁeld with tilt K♭.
Let us consider the case of projective space.
In all
applications of perfectoid spaces, the hard part is to ﬁnd a way to pass from ob-
jects of ﬁnite type over K to perfectoid objects. This is not possible in a canonical
way, and one has to make a choice.
On Pn, one has the map ϕ : Pn →Pn sending (x0 : . . . : xn) to (xp
0 : . . . : xp
n).
Consider Pn
K as an adic space over K. Then there is a perfectoid space (Pn
K)perf
over K such that
(Pn
K)perf ∼lim
←−
ϕ
Pn
K .
Here, ∼lim
←−, read ’being similar to the inverse limit’, is a technical notion that
accounts for the non-existence of inverse limits in the category of adic spaces, cf.
[62, Deﬁnition 2.4.1]. Explicitly, (Pn
K)perf is glued out of n + 1 copies of
Spa(K⟨T 1/p∞
1
, . . . , T 1/p∞
n
⟩, OK⟨T 1/p∞
1
, . . . , T 1/p∞
n
⟩)
in the usual way. One can make the same construction over K♭to get (Pn
K♭)perf.
Theorem 7.1 ([58, Theorem 8.5]). The perfectoid space (Pn
K)perf tilts to (Pn
K♭)perf.
In particular, there are homeomorphisms of topological spaces underlying the adic
spaces
|Pn
K♭| ∼= |(Pn
K♭)perf| ∼= |(Pn
K)perf| ∼= lim
←−
ϕ
|Pn
K| .
Similarly, there are isomorphisms of ´etale sites
(Pn
K♭)´et ∼= (Pn
K♭)perf
´et
∼= (Pn
K)perf
´et
∼= lim
←−
ϕ
(Pn
K)´et .
These constructions give a ’projection map’
π : Pn
K♭→Pn
K
deﬁned on topological spaces and ´etale topoi, and given by (x0 : . . . : xn) 7→(x♯
0 :
. . . : x♯
n) in coordinates.

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications

There are many variants to this theorem. All one needs is a ’dynamical system’
(X, ϕ) over K such that (with respect to a suitable integral model of X) ϕ is a lift
of Frobenius. For example, one might take X = Pn with
ϕ : (x0 : . . . : xn) 7→(xp
0 + pP0(x0, . . . , xn) : . . . : xp
n + pPn(x0, . . . , xn))
for arbitrary homogeneous polynomial P0, . . . , Pn ∈Zp[x0, . . . , xn] of degree p. In
that case, the tilt will still be (Pn
K♭)perf. One might also take a canonical lift of an
ordinary abelian variety, with its canonical lift of Frobenius. In that case, the tilt
will be the perfection of the ordinary abelian variety in characteristic p. However,
nothing of this sort works of curves of genus ≥2. Currently, there are very few
explicit examples of tilting for varieties besides the cases of toric varieties and
(semi-)abelian varieties. An interesting case might be the one of ﬂag varieties.
8. Weight-monodromy conjecture
One application of the theory of perfectoid spaces is to a class of cases of the
weight-monodromy conjecture. Let us brieﬂy recall the statement, cf. [18].
Let X over Qp (or a ﬁnite extension thereof) be a proper smooth variety. Fix a
prime ℓ̸= p. On the ´etale cohomology group V = Hi(XQp, Qℓ), the absolute Galois
group GQp acts. Fix a Frobenius element Frob ∈GQp. From the Weil conjectures,
[19], the Rapoport-Zink spectral sequence, [54], and de Jong’s alterations, [42], the
following is known about the structure of V :
(i) There is a direct sum decomposition V = L2i
j=0 Vj, where all eigenvalues of
Frob on Vj are Weil numbers of weight j.
(ii) There is a nilpotent operator N : V →V mapping Vj →Vj−2, coming from
the action of the pro-ℓ-inertia.
Conjecture 8.1 ([18]). For any j = 0, . . . , i, the map N j : Vi+j →Vi−j is an
isomorphism.
This is somewhat reminiscent of the Lefschetz decomposition, and is sometimes
said to be ’Mirror dual’ to it. There is a similar result for projective smooth families
of complex manifolds over a punctured complex disc, which is known to be true
by work of Schmid, [56], and Steenbrink, [63].
Deligne proved the analogue for X over Fp((t)) in [20].7 Our result deduces the
conjecture over Qp in many cases by reduction to equal characteristic, via tilting.
Theorem 8.2 ([58]). Let X be a geometrically connected proper smooth variety
over a ﬁnite extension of Qp which is a set-theoretic complete intersection in a
projective smooth toric variety. Then the weight-monodromy conjecture holds true
for X.
7Actually, he assumed that X is already deﬁned over a curve, but this assumption can be
removed.

Note that this result is new even for a smooth hypersurface in projective space.
Let us note that strictly speaking, the author is not aware of any (geometrically
connected projective smooth) X which does provably not satisfy this assumption.
However, we can also not prove it in any reasonable generality.
9. Close local ﬁelds: Work of Hattori
Recall that the theory of perfectoid spaces developed as a generalization of the
Fontaine-Wintenberger result which worked with inﬁnite extensions of Qp. Hattori
shows that one can, however, use this theory to prove generalizations of Deligne’s
results on close local ﬁelds. Let us state here one of his results.
For a complete discrete valuation ﬁeld K with valuation v (normalized with
image Z ∪{∞}) and residue characteristic p, the absolute ramiﬁcation index eK is
deﬁned as eK = v(p). In particular, eK = ∞if K is of characteristic p.
Theorem 9.1 ([35, Theorem 1.2 (ii)]). Let K1 and K2 be two complete discrete
valuation ﬁelds of residue characteristic p, such that the residue ﬁelds k1 ∼= k2 are
isomorphic. Let j ≤min(eK1, eK2). Then there is an isomorphism
GK1/G(j)
K1 ∼= GK2/G(j)
K2 .
The main novelty is that the residue ﬁelds ki are not assumed to be perfect.
Thus, Hattori has to use the Abbes-Saito ramiﬁcation ﬁltration for complete dis-
crete valuation ﬁelds with imperfect residue ﬁelds, [1]. This is deﬁned in terms of
geometrically connected components of certain rigid-analytic varieties. Hattori’s
approach is to use perfectoid spaces to compare these rigid-analytic varieties in
diﬀerent characteristics. For this, one has to check that connected components do
not change when passing to the perfectoid world, i.e. extracting a lot of p-power
roots; this uses the bound on the ramiﬁcation degree and an explicit computa-
tion. Then the result follows from the homeomorphism X ∼= X♭of underlying
topological spaces.
In particular, this shows that the theory of perfectoid spaces gives new infor-
mation on the other approaches to changing the characteristic. We note that in
the representation theory of local groups, there are Hecke algebra isomorphisms
for not-too-ramiﬁed types of close local ﬁelds, mirroring the Galois story on the
automorphic side, cf. [43]. It would be interesting to see if perfectoid spaces can
shed new light on these Hecke algebra isomorphisms as well.
10. Rigid Motives: Work of Vezzani
Another way in which perfectoid spaces have been used to study phenomena of
changing the characteristic is in relation to Ayoub’s category of rigid motives, cf.
[5]. Rigid motives are deﬁned by formally repeating some constructions from A1-
homotopy theory, working with the category of smooth rigid-analytic varieties, and

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
13
replacing A1 by the closed unit ball. For any nonarchimedean ﬁeld K and any ring
Λ, one gets the resulting category of rigid motives RigMot(K, Λ) with coeﬃcients
in Λ.
The following theorem is due to Vezzani:
Theorem 10.1 ([65]). Let K be a perfectoid ﬁeld with tilt K♭. For any Q-algebra
Λ, the categories RigMot(K, Λ) ∼= RigMot(K♭, Λ) are canonically equivalent.
This can be regarded as a version of the Fontaine-Wintenberger isomorphism for
’rigid motivic Galois groups’. Vezzani’s strategy is to compare both categories to
categories of ’perfectoid motives’ which one gets from (suitable) perfectoid spaces.
It is rather formal that these perfectoid motives are equivalent over K and K♭,
and the task becomes to relate these to classical ﬁnite-type objects.
11. p-adic Hodge theory
The subject of p-adic Hodge theory can be regarded as a parallel to Deligne’s
formulation of complex Hodge theory as the interrelationship between the various
cohomology theories associated with compact K¨ahler manifolds. Let us recall the
most important results in the complex setting. Fix a compact K¨ahler manifold
X. One has the singular cohomology Hi(X, Z), the de Rham cohomology Hi
dR(X)
deﬁned as hypercohomology of the holomorphic de Rham complex
Ω•
X = OX →Ω1
X →. . .
and the Hodge cohomology groups Hi(X, Ωj
X).
Theorem 11.1 (Poincar´e lemma). The inclusion C →Ω•
X is a quasi-isomorphism
of sheaves of complexes. In particular,
Hi(X, Z) ⊗C = Hi(X, C) ∼= Hi
dR(X) .
Theorem 11.2 (Hodge). The Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence
Eij
1 = Hj(X, Ωi
X) ⇒Hi+j
dR (X)
degenerates at E1. In particular, Hi
dR(X) admits a decreasing de Rham ﬁltration
Filj Hi
dR(X) with associated graded pieces Hj(X, Ωi−j
X ).
Theorem 11.3 (Hodge). There is a canonical Hodge decomposition
Hi(X, Z) ⊗C =
i
M
j=0
Hj(X, Ωi−j
X ) .
Here, Hj(X, Ωi−j
X ) is identiﬁed with the intersection
Filj Hi
dR(X) ∩Fili−j Hi
dR(X) ,
using transversality of Fil• and the complex conjugate ﬁltration Fil•.

14
Peter Scholze
Now let C be a complete and algebraically closed extension of Qp. For ex-
ample, C = Cp, the completion of Qp. Note that C is perfectoid. Let X be a
proper smooth rigid-analytic variety over C. (In particular, X is of ﬁnite type,
and certainly not perfectoid.) This should be regarded as the analogue of a com-
pact complex manifold, which is not necessarily K¨ahler. Prior to the author’s work
on the subject, all work concentrated on the case of algebraic X, but it is shown
in [59] that this restriction is not necessary.
Again, one has de Rham and Hodge cohomology groups Hi
dR(X), Hi(X, Ωj
X),
deﬁned in the same way. What replaces singular cohomology is ´etale cohomol-
ogy Hi
´et(X, Zp). The following result generalizes a fact well-known for algebraic
varieties.
Theorem 11.4 ([59, Theorem 1.1], [60, Theorem 3.17]). Let X be a proper rigid-
analytic variety over C. Then Hi
´et(X, Zp) is a ﬁnitely generated Zp-module, which
vanishes for i > 2 dim X.
Properness is crucial here.
In fact, already for a closed unit disc, the Fp-
cohomology is inﬁnite-dimensional, due to the presence of Artin-Schreier covers.
This is in stark contrast with the ℓ-adic case (ℓ̸= p), where strong ﬁniteness
statements are known by work of Berkovich and Huber, [9], [40].
Before explaining the proof of the theorem, let us recall another result from
[59].
Theorem 11.5 ([59, Theorem 1.2]). Let U be a connected aﬃnoid rigid-analytic
variety over C. Then U is a K(π, 1) for p-torsion coeﬃcients. In other words, for
every p-torsion local system L on U, the natural map
Hi(X´et, L) →Hi(π1(X, ¯x), L¯x)
is a bijection, where ¯x ∈X(C) is a base point, and π1(X, ¯x) is the proﬁnite ´etale
fundamental group.
There is Artin’s theorem on good neighborhoods which states that a smooth
algebraic variety in characteristic 0 is locally a K(π, 1). It is interesting to note
that no smallness or smoothness assumption is necessary for this result in the p-
adic world. Let us brieﬂy sketch its proof as this gives a good impression on how
perfectoid spaces are used in applications to p-adic Hodge theory. Let ˜U →U be
’the universal cover of U’, which is the inverse limit of all ﬁnite ´etale covers. It is
not hard to see that ˜U is an aﬃnoid perfectoid space. Essentially, the existence
of enough p-th roots is assured as taking p-th roots is ﬁnite ´etale in characteristic
0. By formal nonsense, it is enough to prove that Hi( ˜U´et, Fp) = 0 for i > 0; we
already know that H1( ˜U´et, Fp) = 0 as this parametrizes ﬁnite ´etale Fp-torsors, of
which there are no more. Thus, we need to prove that Hi( ˜U´et, Fp) = 0 for i > 1.
Lemma 11.6. Let Y be an aﬃnoid perfectoid space. Then Hi(Y´et, Fp) = 0 for
i > 1.

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
15
Proof. By tilting, we may assume that Y is of characteristic p. Then we have the
Artin-Schreier sequence
0 →Fp →OY →OY →0 ,
and the result follows from vanishing of coherent cohomology: Hi(Y, OY ) = 0 for
i > 0.
Thus, the general idea is to cover X locally by pro-´etale maps from perfectoid
spaces, and then use qualitative properties of perfectoid spaces, which are veriﬁed
in characteristic p. For this purpose, one introduces the pro-´etale site Xpro´et, in
which X is locally perfectoid in a suitable sense.8
By resolution of singularities for rigid-analytic varieties, the proof of the ﬁnite-
ness theorem reduces to the proper smooth case; moreover, it is enough to handle
the case of Fp-coeﬃcients. In that case, the argument is involved and makes heavy
use of the full machinery of perfectoid spaces, cf. [59]. Roughly, it proceeds in two
steps. First, one shows that Hi
´et(X, O+
X/p) is almost ﬁnitely generated. This makes
use of the Cartan-Serre technique of shrinking covers, and the almost vanishing
of Hi(Y´et, O+
Y ) on aﬃnoid perfectoid spaces Y . As stated above, this vanishing
is a strengthening of Faltings’s almost purity theorem. One applies it by locally
covering X by perfectoid spaces. Then one uses a variant of the Artin-Schreier
sequence
0 →Fp →O+
X/p →O+
X/p →0
to deduce ﬁniteness of Fp-cohomology. In fact, one gets the following basic com-
parison result at the same time.
Theorem 11.7 ([59, Theorem 1.3], [60, Theorem 3.17]). Let X be a proper rigid-
analytic variety over C. Then the natural map
Hi(X´et, Fp) ⊗OC/p →Hi(X´et, O+
X/p)
is an almost isomorphism, i.e. both the kernel and the cokernel are killed by the
maximal ideal of OC.
This is a variant on a result of Faltings, [25, Theorem §3.8].
It forms the
basic result which allows one to pass from ´etale cohomology to coherent coho-
mology (including here de Rham and Hodge cohomology). Note that the result
implies the following remarkable behaviour of M = RΓ(X´et, O+
X). After inverting
p, M[p−1] = RΓ(X´et, OX) = RΓ(X, OX) is usual coherent cohomology. However,
after (derived) modding out p,
M/p = RΓ(X´et, O+
X/p) ∼=a RΓ(X´et, Fp) ⊗OC/p
is almost isomorphic to ´etale cohomology.
In particular, M[p−1] lives only in
degrees 0 through dim X, while M itself has torsion going up until degree 2 dim X.
8The idea of the pro-´etale site has turned out to be quite powerful for foundational questions,
even in the case of schemes. For new foundations for ℓ-adic cohomology of schemes, see [10].

16
Peter Scholze
It also shows the full strength of the result that Hi(Y´et, O+
Y ) is almost zero for
i > 0, if Y is an aﬃnoid perfectoid space: Certainly, nothing similar is true for a
ﬁnite type space. It means that all the torsion in the cohomology of O+
X gets killed
after passing to perfectoid covers. This will be at the heart of the applications to
torsion in the cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, cf. Section 17.
Let us now mention the analogues of the theorems in the complex world, stated
earlier. For deﬁniteness, we assume here that X = X0 ×k C is the base-change of
some X0 deﬁned over a completed discretely valued extension k of Qp with perfect
residue ﬁeld. Moreover, we assume that X0 is proper and smooth.
Theorem 11.8 ([59, Corollary 1.8]). The Gk-representation Hi
´et(X, Qp) is de
Rham in the sense of Fontaine, and one has the comparison between ´etale and
de Rham cohomology
Hi
´et(X, Qp) ⊗Qp BdR ∼= Hi
dR(X0) ⊗k BdR .
In particular, Hi
dR(X0) is the ﬁltered k-vector space associated with the de Rham
Gk-representation Hi
´et(X, Qp).
This is a known phenomenon in p-adic Hodge theory: To get the comparison
theorems, one has to extend scalars to Fontaine’s big period rings. Here, we use
BdR, which is a complete discrete valuation ﬁeld with residue ﬁeld C.
Theorem 11.9 ([59, Corollary 1.8]). The Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence
Eij
1 = Hj(X, Ωi
X) ⇒Hi+j
dR (X)
degenerates at E1. In particular, Hi
dR(X) admits a decreasing de Rham ﬁltration
Filj Hi
dR(X) with associated graded pieces Hj(X, Ωi−j
X ).
Note that no K¨ahler assumption is necessary here. It is interesting to note
that some non-K¨ahler complex manifolds have p-adic analogues, such as the Hopf
surface: Divide A2 \ {(0, 0)} by the diagonal action of multiplication by q for some
q ∈k with |q| < 1 to get a proper smooth rigid-analytic variety X. This has
Hodge numbers h01 = dim H0(X, Ω1
X) = 0 while h10 = dim H1(X, OX) = 1, so
Hodge symmetry fails. However, Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration holds true for
the Hopf surface. Fortunately, Iwasawa manifolds for which the Hodge-to-de Rham
degeneration fails, do not have p-adic analogues.
The next result does not need a K¨ahler assumption either:
Theorem 11.10 ([59, Corollary 1.8], [60, Theorem 3.20]). There is a Hodge-Tate
decomposition
Hi
´et(X, Qp) ⊗Qp C ∼=
i
M
j=0
Hi−j(X, Ωj
X)(−j) .
Here, (−j) denotes a Tate twist. More generally, if X is only deﬁned over C, there
is a Hodge-Tate spectral sequence
Eij
2 = Hi(X, Ωj
X)(−j) ⇒Hi+j
´et (X, Qp) ⊗Qp C .

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
17
It degenerates at E2 if X is algebraic or deﬁned over k (and probably does in
general), giving a Hodge-Tate ﬁltration on Hi
´et(X, Qp)⊗Qp C with associated graded
pieces Hi−j(X, Ωj
X)(−j).
Note the interesting diﬀerences between the Hodge-Tate spectral sequence and
the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence: It starts at E2, and i and j are inter-
changed. Moreover, a Tate twist appears.
12. Relative ϕ-modules: Work of Kedlaya-Liu
At around the same time that the author wrote [58], Kedlaya-Liu, [47], [48], worked
out closely related results9 with the goal of constructing Qp-local systems on period
domains, as were conjectured by Rapoport-Zink, [55]. Let us brieﬂy recall the
conjecture of Rapoport-Zink, in the case of the group GLn.
Fix a perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p, and let V be a k-isocrystal, i.e.
a
W(k)[p−1]-vector space V of ﬁnite dimension n equipped with a σ-linear isomor-
phism φ : V →V . Moreover, ﬁx a ’ﬁltration type’, i.e. for each integer i ∈Z
a multiplicity ni ≥0 such that n = P ni.
The space of decreasing ﬁltrations
Fil• V ⊂V for which gri V has dimension ni forms naturally an algebraic variety
F over W(k)[p−1]; we consider F as an adic space over W(k)[p−1].
If x ∈F(K) is a point deﬁned over a ﬁnite extension K of W(k)[p−1], then, by
a theorem of Colmez-Fontaine, [17], the triple (V, φ, Fil•) comes from a crystalline
representation L(x) of GK if and only if it is weakly admissible. Weak admissibility
is an analogue of a semistability condition, comparing Hodge and Newton slopes.
There is a maximal open subspace Fwa ⊂F whose classical points are the weakly
admissible points, cf. [55].
Conjecture 12.1. For any smooth subspace X ⊂F such that the universal ﬁl-
tration restricted to X satisﬁes Griﬃths transversality, there exists a natural open
subset Xa ⊂Xwa := X ∩Fwa with the same classical points, and a Qp-local sys-
tem L(X) on Xa, which gives the GK-representation L(x) when passing to the
ﬁbre over any x ∈Xa(K).
The original conjecture of Rapoport-Zink was more optimistic in that it conjec-
tured the existence of L(X) for X = F, and not only on subspaces where Griﬃths
transversality is satisﬁed. However, this does not ﬁt with the p-adic Hodge theory
formalism. Note that if the ﬁltration is of ’minuscule type’, meaning that ni ̸= 0
for at most two consecutive i, then Griﬃths transversality is satisﬁed on all of F.
This assumption is satisﬁed in all cases investigated in [55], which are related to
p-divisible groups.
Kedlaya announced a proof of this conjecture in [45]. Very roughly, the strategy
of Kedlaya-Liu is to construct the local system locally in the pro-´etale site and then
glue. This reduces the problem to the perfectoid case. Moreover, now one has to
construct a Qp-local system on the perfectoid space, or equivalently its tilt. But
9In particular, they proved Corollary 6.12 independently.

18
Peter Scholze
in characteristic p, Qp-local systems can be constructed from ϕ-modules by Artin-
Schreier-Witt theory. Thus, ﬁrst they build a ϕ-module over a relative Robba ring.
Then they need to show that the locus where this ϕ-module is pure of slope 0 is
open, and that locally on this locus, an integral structure exists. These theorems
are proved in [47]; they generalize previous results of Kedlaya on slope ﬁltrations
and the existence of integral structures in the absolute setting, [44].
13. Universal covers of p-divisible groups and abelian
varieties
The following deﬁnition of a universal cover arose repeatedly in recent years, cf.
e.g. [27], [30]. We identify a formal scheme S with the functor it represents on
(discrete) rings, so e.g.
(Spf lim
←−A/In)(R) = lim
−→Hom(A/In, R) .
By a commutative group G over S, we mean an fqpc sheaf of commutative groups
on the category of discrete rings living over S. In other words, for any discrete ring
R with an R-valued point S(R), one has a commutative group G(R), satisfying
fpqc descent. We are particularly interested in the cases where G is an abelian
variety or a p-divisible group.
Deﬁnition 13.1. Let S be a formal scheme over Spf Zp, and let G/S be a com-
mutative group. The universal cover ˜G of G is deﬁned as ˜G = lim
←−×p G.
Let us record several examples.
(i) If G = Gm is the multiplicative group over Zp, then ˜G = Spf Zp⟨T ±1/p∞⟩.
(ii) If G = Spf R[[T1, . . . , Td]] is a formal p-divisible group over a ring R, then
˜G ∼= Spf R[[T 1/p∞
1
, . . . , T 1/p∞
d
]]. Indeed, if R is of characteristic p, then this
follows from the fact that p = FV , and, since G is formal, a power of F
is divisible by p, so that lim
←−p G = lim
←−F G(pn). In general, it follows from
rigidity, cf. below. In particular, if R = OK is the ring of integers in a
perfectoid ﬁeld K, then the generic ﬁbre ˜Gη of ˜G is canonically a perfectoid
space over K.
(iii) If G = Ga is the additive group, then ˜G = 0. Indeed, if R is a discrete ring
over Spf Zp, then p is nilpotent in R. This implies that ˜G(R) = lim
←−×p R is
Mittag-Leﬄer zero.
For any formal scheme S over Spf Zp, we may consider the categories of uni-
versal covers of abelian varieties, resp. universal covers of p-divisible groups, over
S, as full subcategories of the category of commutative groups over S.

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
19
Proposition 13.2. Let S′ ⊂S be a closed immersion of formal schemes deﬁned
by a topologically nilpotent ideal. Then the categories of universal covers of abelian
varieties (resp. p-divisible groups) over S and S′ are equivalent.
Proof. Using that abelian varieties and p-divisible groups deform, one gets essential
surjectivity. To prove full faithfulnes, one reduces formally to the case of a nilpotent
immersion of schemes S′ ⊂S. In that case, one knows that the categories of abelian
varieties (resp. p-divisible groups) up to p-power isogeny are equivalent, cf. e.g.
[41]. As passage to universal covers turns p-power isogenies into isomorphisms, the
result follows.
Thus, the universal cover may be considered as a crystal on the inﬁnitesimal
site. In particular, let us ﬁx an abelian variety or a p-divisible group G0 over a
perfect ﬁeld k of characteristic p, of height h. It has a universal deformation space
S ∼= Spf W(k)[[T1, . . . , Tk]] (cf. [41]), and a universal deformation G/S. However,
the universal cover ˜G is constant, equal to the evaluation of the crystal ˜G0 on the
thickening S →Spec k.
Note that inside ˜G one has the Tate module TpG = ker( ˜G →G) = lim
←−×p G[pn].
If one ﬁxes a C-valued point of the generic ﬁbre of S, where C is an algebraically
closed complete extension of W(k)[p−1], then Λ = (TpG)(OC) ∼= Zh
p ⊂˜G(OC) is
a Zp-lattice. Informally, one gets back G = ˜G/TpG by quotienting ˜G by this Zp-
lattice. Here, ˜G is independent of the chosen point, but the Zp-lattice varies. This
is reminiscent of the complex uniformization of abelian varieties: Their universal
cover is constant, and diﬀerent abelian varieties correspond to diﬀerent Z-lattices
in the universal cover. Riemann’s theorem gives a condition on when the quotient
exists as an algebraic variety in terms of the existence of a polarization.
The following theorem is proved in joint work with Weinstein.10
Theorem 13.3 ([62, Theorem D]). Fix a p-divisible group G0 over a perfect ﬁeld
k of height h and dimension d, as well as a complete and algebraically closed
extension C of W(k)[p−1]. Consider the category of lifts (G, ρ) of G0 to OC up
to quasi-isogeny: Here, G/OC is a p-divisible group, and ρ : G0 ×k OC/p →
G ×OC OC/p is a quasi-isogeny. Then the category of lifts (G, ρ) is equivalent to
the category of Zp-lattices Λ ∼= Zh
p ⊂˜G0(OC) for which there exists a (necessarily
unique) h −d-dimensional subspace W ⊂M(G0)(OC)[p−1] ∼= Ch such that the
image of Λ under the quasi-logarithm map
qlog : ˜G0(OC) →M(G0)(OC)[p−1]
lies in W, and
0 →Λ[p−1] →˜G0(OC) →Ch/W →0
is exact.
10One may deduce a similar result for abelian varieties by using Serre-Tate theory if one
incorporates a polarization to guarantee algebraization.

20
Peter Scholze
To understand the last condition, consider the universal vector extension EG0
of G0, which is a crystal on the crystalline site of k. Then M(G0) = Lie EG0 is
the covariant Dieudonn´e module of G0. Now one has the logarithm map
logEG0 : EG0(OC) →Lie EG0(OC)[p−1] = M(G0)(OC)[p−1] .
On the other hand, ˜G0 = ]
EG0, as the universal cover of vector groups vanishes.
Thus, one gets the quasi-logarithm map
qlog : ˜G0(OC) = ]
EG0(OC) →EG0(OC) →M(G0)(OC)[p−1] .
After ﬁxing a lift G and composing with the Hodge ﬁltration M(G0)(OC)[p−1] →
(Lie G)[p−1] corresponding to G, one gets the logarithm map ˜G0(OC) = ˜G(OC) →
G(OC) →Lie G[p−1]. Thus, the quasi-logarithm map is a ’universal logarithm for
all possible lifts of G0’. The condition comes from the fact that the image of Λ lies
in the kernel of the Hodge ﬁltration M(G0)(OC)[p−1] →(Lie G)[p−1], which is of
dimension h −d. Moreover, the sequence
0 →Λ[p−1] →˜G(OC) →(Lie G)[p−1] →0
is exact.
This gives one analogue of Riemann’s theorem on the classiﬁcation of complex
abelian varieties.
The following theorem, again proved in joint work with We-
instein, [62], and closely related to the previous theorem, gives a diﬀerent such
analogue. For this, we use that any p-divisible group G over OC has a Hodge-Tate
ﬁltration
0 →(Lie G) ⊗OC C(1) →TpG ⊗Zp C →(Lie G∗)∗⊗OC C →0 ,
which is an analogue of the Hodge-Tate ﬁltration deﬁned above for proper smooth
varieties over C, cf.
Theorem 11.10.
This Hodge-Tate ﬁltration for p-divisible
groups was known previously, and is due to Faltings, [24], cf. also Fargues, [28].
Theorem 13.4 ([62, Theorem B]). The category of p-divisible groups over OC is
equivalent to the category of pairs (Λ, W) where Λ is a ﬁnite free Zp-module, and
W ⊂Λ ⊗Zp C is a C-subvectorspace.
The functor is given by G 7→(TpG, Lie G ⊗OC C(1)). This is analogous to the
classiﬁcation of complex abelian varieties by their ﬁrst singular homology, together
with the Hodge ﬁltration.
14. Lubin-Tate spaces: Work of Weinstein
Weinstein has observed that the Lubin-Tate tower at inﬁnite level carries a natural
structure as a perfectoid space. For this, ﬁx an integer n ≥1 and a p-divisible
group G0 of dimension 1 and height n. The Lubin-Tate tower at inﬁnite level

MG0,∞parametrizes triples (G, ρ, α) where (G, ρ) is a deformation of G0 up to
quasi-isogeny as before, and α : Zn
p →TpG is an inﬁnite level structure.
One may deﬁne a p-divisible group V G0 of G0 of dimension 1 and height 1 by
taking the highest exterior power of the Dieudonn´e module M(G0), and passing
back to p-divisible groups. This uses crucially that G0 is of dimension 1. One may
construct an alternating map
det : ˜G0 ⊗. . . ⊗˜G0 →^
^
G0 .
This follows from the work of Hedayatzadeh, [36], or from a result in Dieudonn´e
theory in the joint work with Weinstein, [62]. Fix a perfectoid ﬁeld K; then this
gives a similar map on the generic ﬁbre, base-changed to K:
det : ˜G0,K ⊗. . . ⊗˜G0,K →^
^
G0K .

The following theorem is easy to deduce from Theorem 13.3, but was proved earlier
directly by Weinstein.

All intervening objects are perfectoid spaces over K, and the inclusions are locally
closed (i.e., open subsets of Zariski closed subsets).
All objects in this diagram can be made completely explicit. Weinstein has
used this to ﬁnd explicit aﬃnoid perfectoid subsets of MG0,∞whose cohomology
realizes the local Langlands correspondence for speciﬁc supercuspidal representa-
tions, cf. [12]. Recall that it is known (by the work of Harris-Taylor, [34]) that
the cohomology of MG0,∞realizes the local Langlands correspondence for all su-
percuspidal representations of GLn(Qp). It is remarkable that while at any ﬁnite
level, one cannot give an explicit description of the Lubin-Tate tower, it is possible
to describe MG0,∞, together with all group actions, explicitly.
In [62], it is proved that more general Rapoport-Zink spaces become perfectoid
at inﬁnite level, and a description purely in terms of p-adic Hodge theory is given.
This made it possible to prove the duality isomorphism for basic Rapoport-Zink
spaces. In particular, one gets that Drinfeld and Lubin-Tate tower are isomorphic

at inﬁnite level as perfectoid spaces. This improves on earlier results of Faltings,
[26], and Fargues, [28], who proved such isomorphisms, but had to struggle with
formalizing them, as no category was known in which both inﬁnite level spaces
lived a priori. Their method is to work with suitable formal models; for this, new
formal models have to be constructed ﬁrst, which is at least technically challenging.
It was recently suggested by Rapoport-Viehmann, [53], that there should exist
a theory of ’local Shimura varieties’, which should relate to Rapoport-Zink spaces
in the same way that general Shimura varieties relate to Shimura varieties of PEL
type. The new perspective on Rapoport-Zink spaces mentioned above should make
it possible to prove (parts of) their conjectures.
15. p-adic cohomology of the Lubin-Tate tower
The Lubin-Tate tower plays an important role in the Langlands program because
its ℓ-adic cohomology for ℓ̸= p realizes the local Langlands correspondence, cf.
[34]. In the emerging p-adic local Langlands program, which has taken a deﬁnitive
form only for GL2(Qp), cf. [13], one hopes for a similar realization of the p-adic
local Langlands correspondence. However, the Fp-cohomology of the Lubin-Tate
tower is too inﬁnite due to the presence of many Artin-Schreier covers. Still, a
variant of Theorem 11.4 holds true in this context; for simplicity, we state only the
version with Fp-coeﬃcients; a similar result holds true with Zp-coeﬃcients.
Let F be a ﬁnite extension of Qp. Fix an admissible Fp-representation π of
GLn(F). Using the Lubin-Tate tower at inﬁnite level, which is a GLn(F)-torsor
over Pn−1
˘
F
, where ˘F denotes the completion of the maximal unramiﬁed extension
of F, one gets an ´etale sheaf Fπ on Pn−1
˘
F
. It is naturally D×-equivariant, and
equipped with a Weil descent datum. Here, D is the division algebra of invariant
1/n over F. The following theorem is work in progress of the author, and relies
on the techniques of the proof of Theorem 11.4 along with the duality between
Lubin-Tate and Drinfeld tower.
Theorem 15.1. Let C/ ˘F be complete and algebraically closed. Then Hi(Pn−1
C
, Fπ)
is an admissible D×-representation, which vanishes for i > 2(n −1), and is in-
dependent of C. The resulting functor from admissible GLn(F)-representations
to admissible D× × GF -representations is compatible with some global correspon-
dences.
This makes it possible to pass from GLn(F)-representations to Galois repre-
sentations in a purely local way. In the global setup, it proves that the GLn(F)-
representation determines the local Galois group representation.
16. Shimura varieties
Fix a reductive group G over Q with a Shimura datum of Hodge type, giving
rise to a Shimura variety SK, K ⊂G(Af), over the reﬂex ﬁeld E. There is a

Hecke-equivariant compactiﬁcation S∗
K, ﬁnite under the minimal compactiﬁcation
S∗
K →S∗
K, and a ﬂag variety F with G-action, such that the following are true.11
Theorem 16.1. Fix a tame level Kp ⊂G(Ap
f) and a map E →C to a complete
and algebraically closed extension C of Qp.
Let (S∗
K)ad denote the adic space
associated with S∗
K ⊗E C. Then there is a perfectoid space S∗
Kp over C such that
S∗
Kp ∼lim
←−
Kp
(S∗
KpKp)ad .
Moreover, there is a G(Qp)-action on S∗
Kp and a G(Qp)-equivariant Hodge-Tate
period map
πHT : S∗
Kp →F .
The map πHT is equivariant for the Hecke operators prime to p with respect to the
trivial action on F; in particular, πHT contracts G(Ap
f)-orbits. There is a cover
of F by aﬃnoid subsets U ⊂F for which π−1
HT(U) ⊂S∗
Kp is an aﬃnoid perfectoid
subset.
The geometry of πHT is very interesting. Consider the case of the modular
curve.
Here, F = P1, and πHT is a p-adic analogue of the embedding of the
complex upper half-plane (which is a path-connected component of the inverse
limit over all levels lim
←−K SK(C)) into P1(C). In both cases, the map is given by
the Hodge ﬁltration.
In the case of the modular curve, S∗
Kp = S∗
Kp has a stratiﬁcation into the
ordinary and the supersingular locus, Sord
Kp and Sss
Kp.12 The ﬂag variety is F = P1.
Then, under πHT, all of Sord
Kp maps into P1(Qp), while the supersingular locus Sss
Kp
maps into Ω2. Here, Ω2 = P1 \ P1(Qp) is Drinfeld’s upper half-plane, which is
reminiscent of the complex upper and lower half-plane, which can be written as
P1 \ P1(R). It follows that πHT contracts connected components of the ordinary
locus to points, whereas it does something interesting on the supersingular locus.
On the ordinary locus, the map is given by the position of the canonical sub-
group. On the supersingular locus, Sss
Kp is a ﬁnite disjoint union of Lubin-Tate
towers at inﬁnite level (for n = 2); these are isomorphic to the Drinfeld tower at
inﬁnite level, which is a pro-ﬁnite ´etale cover of Ω2. The composite is πHT. In
particular, the isomorphism between Lubin-Tate and Drinfeld tower is built into
the geometry of πHT.
Let us note another perspective on what the Hodge-Tate period map does.
Namely, by Theorem 13.4, giving the Hodge ﬁltration is equivalent to giving the p-
divisible group. This means that the Hodge-Tate period map, on geometric points
of the good reduction locus, is the map sending an abelian variety to its p-divisible
group (equipped with all extra structure).
11It should be possible to use the minimal compactiﬁcation itself, and make F more explicit,
but so far this has not been worked out.
12We regard some points of the adic space corresponding to rank-2-valuations as part of the
ordinary locus which would usually be considered as part of the supersingular locus. We do so
by replacing the ordinary part by its closure.

17. Torsion in the cohomology of locally symmetric
varieties
As the ﬁnal topic, we summarize the application of these ideas to the study of
torsion in the cohomology of locally symmetric spaces.
Fix a reductive group G over Q. For any (suﬃciently small) compact open
subgroup K ⊂G(Af), one has the locally symmetric space
YK = G(Q)\ (G(R)/K∞A◦
∞× G(Af)/K) ,
where K∞⊂G(R) is a maximal compact subgroup, and A∞⊂G(R) are the
R-valued points of a maximal Q-split central torus, with identity component A◦
∞.
Fixing a tame level Kp ⊂G(Ap
f), one deﬁnes the completed cohomology groups
˜Hi(Kp) = lim
←−
n
lim
−→
Kp
Hi(YKpKp, Z/pnZ) , ˜Hi
c(Kp) = lim
←−
n
lim
−→
Kp
Hi
c(YKpKp, Z/pnZ) .
Also recall the cohomological degree q0, which is ’the ﬁrst interesting cohomo-
logical degree’ (namely, the ﬁrst one to which tempered automorphic representa-
tions of G contribute). The following conjecture was proposed by Calegari and
Emerton, [14].
Conjecture 17.1. The completed cohomology groups ˜Hi(Kp), ˜Hi
c(Kp) vanish for
i > q0.
Concretely, this means that all cohomology classes in higher degree become
inﬁnitely p-divisible as one goes up along all levels at p.
If G is a torus, the
conjecture is equivalent to Leopoldt’s conjecture. On the other hand, we proved
the following theorem.
Theorem 17.2 ([61, Theorem I.7]). Assume that G gives rise to a Shimura variety,
so that q0 is the (complex) dimension of the associated Shimura variety. Then
Conjecture 17.1 holds true for compactly supported cohomology.
If one establishes that also toroidal compactiﬁcations become perfectoid at
inﬁnite level, then one gets the same result for usual cohomology. Unfortunately,
for all tori which give rise to Shimura varieties, the Leopoldt conjecture is trivially
satisﬁed, as the group of units is ﬁnite.
The key to the proof is to translate everything into the setting of Shimura
varieties at inﬁnite level as perfectoid spaces. In that case, one can use the basic
comparison theorem to pass to the cohomology of O+/p. But at inﬁnite level, one
has almost vanishing of higher cohomology of O+/p on aﬃnoids as the space is
perfectoid. This shows vanishing above the middle dimension, which is exactly the
desired statement.
In fact, the same argument proves the following theorem over C, which the
author does not know how to prove directly.

Theorem 17.3. Let X ⊂Pn
C be a closed subvariety of dimension d.
For any
m ≥0, let Xm ⊂Pn
C be the pullback of X under the map Pn

C sending
(x0 : . . . : xn) to (xpm
0
: . . . : xpm
n ). Then, for any i > d,
lim
−→
m
Hi(Xm, Fp) = 0 .
For classes in the image of cup product with c1(O(1)), this follows from the
fact that c1(O(1)) becomes inﬁnitely p-divisible. By hard Lefschetz, this accounts
for everything rationally, but it does not say anything about possible p-torsion in
the cohomology.
18. Galois representations
It was conjectured since the 1970’s by Grunewald that torsion in the cohomology
of locally symmetric spaces gives rise to Galois representations. This conjecture
was made precise by Ash, [2], and is a ’mod p analogue’ of (one direction of) the
global Langlands conjectures. Since then, it was numerically veriﬁed in many cases:
what happens is that a Hecke eigenvalue system matches Frobenius eigenvalues of
a Galois representations for the ﬁrst few hundred primes. However, even in these
examples, one could not prove that this happens for all primes.
Theorem 18.1 ([61, Theorem I.3]). Let G be the restriction of scalars of GLn
from a totally real or CM ﬁeld F. Fix any compact open subgroup K ⊂G(Af).
Then, for any system of Hecke eigenvalues ψ appearing in Hi(YK, Fp), there exists
a (unique) continuous semisimple Galois representation
ρψ : GF →GLn(Fp)
such that for all but an explicit ﬁnite set of ’ramiﬁed’ places v of F, the character-
istic polynomial of ρψ(Frobv) is described by the Hecke eigenvalues.
Moreover, there is a version of this theorem for Z/pnZ-cohomology, which in
the inverse limit over n gives results for classical automorphic representations. The
following result was proved earlier by Harris-Lan-Taylor-Thorne, [33], by a diﬀerent
method.
Theorem 18.2 ([61, Theorem I.4]). Let π be a regular algebraic cuspidal automor-
phic representation of GLn(AF ), where F is totally real or CM. Fix an isomorphism
C ∼= Qp. Then there exists a unique continuous semisimple Galois representation
ρπ,p : GF →GLn(Qp)
such that for all but an explicit ﬁnite set of ’ramiﬁed’ places v of F, the character-
istic polynomial of ρπ,p(Frobv) is described by the Satake parameters.

It should be noted that in general, the cohomology of the spaces YK has a lot of
torsion. The simplest example is the case of GL2 over an imaginary-quadratic ﬁeld
in which the relevant YK are hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In that case, computations,
as well as theoretical results, show a huge amount of torsion, cf. e.g. [7]. Therefore,
the thrust of the above theorem lies in the p-torsion part of the cohomology. More-
over, recent work of Calegari-Geraghty, [15], explains how one may use suﬃciently
ﬁne information about existence of Galois representations for torsion classes to
prove automorphy lifting theorems for GLn over F. These properties seem to be
within reach. Together with the strong potential automorphy machinery as in the
work of Barnet-Lamb–Gee–Geraghty–Taylor, [6], this gives some hope that one
can establish potential converse results to Theorem 18.2.
Let us now brieﬂy sketch the proof of Theorem 18.1 in the case F = Q. In that
case, one considers the Siegel moduli space SK, K ⊂GSp2n(Af), i.e. the moduli
space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension n. From the Borel-
Serre compactiﬁcation, [11], it follows that the cohomology of the locally symmetric
space for GLn contributes to the cohomology of the Siegel moduli space. Note
that the Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation is a compactiﬁcation as a real manifold with
corners; this makes it possible that a purely real manifold appears in the boundary
of the algebraic variety SK. Thus, the task becomes to understand torsion in the
cohomology of SK. The theorem is the following.
Theorem 18.3 ([61, Theorem I.5]). Let SK, K ⊂G(Af), be any Shimura va-
riety of Hodge type. Then, for any system of Hecke eigenvalues ψ appearing in
Hi
c(SK,C, Fp), there exists a cuspidal eigenform f (possibly of larger level at p,
and undetermined weight) such that the Hecke eigenvalues of f are congruent to ψ
modulo p.
This produces congruences between torsion classes and classical cusp forms in
large generality. Note that the classes in which we are interested start life as classes
coming from the boundary; still, the theorem produces congruences to cusp forms.
In particular, for non-torsion classes, it is interesting as it produces congruences
between Eisenstein series and cusp forms. However, in the complementary case
where SK is proper, the theorem is also interesting as it controls all possible torsion
classes. For example, it proves the existence of Galois representations for all torsion
classes in U(1, n−1)-Shimura varieties, which is required in recent work of Emerton
and Gee, [22]. The point is that one knows how to attach Galois representations
to cusp forms in great generality, through the work on automorphic forms on
classical groups by Arthur [3] (cf. also [51] for unitary groups) and the work of
Clozel, Kottwitz and Harris-Taylor among others on the cohomology of Shimura
varieties, [16], [50], [34].
To prove the theorem, one starts by using the basic comparison theorem
Hi
c,´et(SK,C, Fp) ⊗OC/p ∼=a Hi
´et(S∗
K,C, I+/p) ,
where I+ ⊂O+ is the ideal sheaf of functions vanishing at the boundary. This
variant of Theorem 11.7 is proved in [60, Theorem 3.13]. This provides a ﬁrst

Perfectoid Spaces and their Applications
27
bridge to the sheaf of cusp forms I+, but one still has to compute cohomology on
the ´etale site. Next, one passes to inﬁnite level at p, and reduces to controlling
Hi
´et(S∗
Kp, I+/p) .
Here, S∗
Kp is perfectoid, so we know that Hi
´et(U, I+/p) is almost zero for i > 0
and aﬃnoid perfectoid subsets U ⊂S∗
Kp; this is a slight variant on Theorem 6.10.
This means that Hi
´et(S∗
Kp, I+/p) can (almost) be computed by a Cech complex
whose terms are the sections of I+/p on aﬃnoid subsets.
The remaining task
is to approximate these forms on U by globally deﬁned forms (of ﬁnite level),
without messing up the Hecke eigenvalues. Usually, the strategy is to multiply by
a multiple of the Hasse invariant. This kills all poles away from the ordinary locus,
and works if U is the ordinary locus. However, in our case we need to do the same
for a covering of all of S∗
Kp.
The crucial property of the Hasse invariant is that it commutes with all Hecke
operators prime to p. In our setup, we can use the following construction: As
πHT : S∗
Kp →F
is equivariant with respect to the trivial action of the Hecke operators prime to
p on F, any function that gets pulled back from F will commute with all Hecke
operators prime to p.
The same stays true for sections of automorphic vector
bundles; automorphic vector bundles come via pullback from F.13 In this way,
one gets enough ’fake-Hasse invariants’ to proceed, and prove the result.
