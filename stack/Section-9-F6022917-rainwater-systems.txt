There are five Assessment Criteria within this Learning Outcome: 
AC1.1. 
State the purpose of gravity rainwater systems used on dwellings 
AC1.2. 
Identify the working principles of gravity rainwater systems used on dwellings  
AC1.3. 
State the common gravity rainwater system component materials 
AC1.4. 
Identify the different types of gutter systems used on dwellings 
AC1.5. 
Identify the different types of rainwater pipework used with gutter systems on dwellings 
AC1.1 State the purpose of gravity rainwater systems used on 
dwellings 
Rain fall in the UK differs greatly. In the North-West rainfall totals around 2.4m per year whilst in the South-
East around 0.5m is the norm. Rain water, as we have seen all too frequently, can inflict major damage to 
property both internally and externally. Gutters and rainwater systems help prevent the damage to the 
building by diverting the water away from vulnerable parts of the building that could be adversely affected 
by large amounts of rainfall. Without gutters and rainwater pipes, the water would simply run off the roof 
and erode the ground around the building, penetrating its structure and undermining its foundations, causing 
subsidence and cracks. 
Modern rainwater systems can benefit modern buildings. Apart from the obvious water diversion uses, rain 
water, that would otherwise run to the sea, can be used in the home. Rain water harvesting systems that 
utilise the rainfall for other purposes such as WC flushing, can save money for the building owners and help 
to preserve our precious water resources for future generations. 
AC1.2 Identify the working principles of gravity rainwater systems 
used on dwellings  
The working principles of rainwater systems is to remove water from rainfall away from buildings, so that it 
does not constitute a nuisance to the buildings occupants or create damage to the buildings structure or 
foundations. 
Domestic gutter systems work by collecting the rainwater that runs off roofs into channels, known as gutters 
and discharging safely away from the building by gravity via rain water pipes into one or a combination of 
the following: 
 
A surface water drain – With the separate system of building drainage, rainwater discharges down 
a dedicated surface water drain (often called a top water drain). 
 
A combined drainage system – both foul water and surface water discharge down the same sewage 
system.

 
A water course – rainwater discharges directly to a stream or river. 
 
A soakaway drain – a pit with a minimum of 1m x 1m x 1m dimensions filled with rubble designed 
to let the water soak naturally away to the water table below ground. 
 
A rainwater harvesting system – a method of collecting rainwater for use within a property for 
flushing WCs and clothes washing. 
AC1.3 State the common gravity rainwater system component 
materials 
PVCu 
BSEN607:2004 
BSEN122001:2000  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Extruded Aluminium 
Most of the guttering used today is made from PVCu because it is light, flexible and 
relatively inexpensive. It does, however, suffer from light degradation when 
exposed to direct sunlight and it expands more than other guttering materials. 
Advantages of PVCu 
Disadvantages of PVCu 
 
Smooth internal bore gives 
better flow rates 
 
Light in weight making it 
easier to handle 
 
Very little maintenance 
required when compared to 
other materials such as cast 
iron 
 
Does not suffer from 
corrosion like other gutter 
and rainwater materials 
 
Easy to joint and install 
 
Various colours available 
means little or no painting 
 
An expected lifespan of 50 
years 
 
Greater co-efficient of linear 
thermal expansion at 
0.06mm/m/0C when 
compared to other guttering 
and rainwater materials. 
 
Tends to go brittle in very cold 
temperatures  
 
Softens at relatively low 
temperature. 
 
Can be affected by wood 
preservatives because of the 
solvent content 
 
Colour can fade in direct 
sunlight 
 
 
Extruded seamless aluminium guttering systems are usually installed by specialist 
companies. It is very lightweight and corrosion resistant. Most gutters of this type 
are formed on site by a special machine that presses the gutter into the required 
profile from a roll of aluminium sheet. Because it is light and flexible, strengtheners 
are fitted to the gutter to give added rigidity before it is installed.

Advantages of extruded aluminium 
Disadvantages of extruded aluminium 
 
It has strength and flexibility 
and is very light in weight 
 
Long continuous lengths 
means fewer joints 
 
Less leakage than other 
gutter systems 
 
It can be formed in many 
profiles and colours 
 
Very little linear thermal 
expansion 
 
The initial cost is expensive 
 
Not suited for properties 
attached to other properties 
unless all buildings are having 
extruded 
aluminium 
installation 
 
Cast Iron 
Cast iron gutters can be seen on many older properties and may still be fitted to 
buildings that want to retain the ‘period’ feel. It is still used on many of the UKs 
listed and historic buildings and even in local authority conservation areas. 
Cast iron is strong but can be very high maintenance, requiring regular painting to 
prevent corrosion. Internally, cast iron has a fairly rough surface and this often 
means regular cleaning out of blockages and silt build up. 
Advantages of extruded aluminium 
Disadvantages of extruded aluminium 
 
It has strength 
 
Maintains the character of 
older historic buildings 
 
 
Cast iron is expensive to 
purchase and time consuming 
to install. 
 
It is very heavy 
 
Requires regular maintenance 
 
Jointing is very messy and 
time consuming 
 
AC1.4 Identify the different types of gutter systems used on dwellings 
In the last 200 years, rainwater and gutter systems have been manufactured in a variety of styles and shapes, 
from the simple lead lined box gutter to the more elaborate ornamental gutters or OGEE gutters, used to 
good effect on Victorian buildings from around 1850. Today, modern gutter profiles add much to the look of 
a building. Choosing the right type of gutter for the building is aesthetically important, especially when 
replacing old, worn gutters for new. Maintaining the ‘period’ feel of the building can enhance the overall 
look. 
There are four main gutter profiles in use today. These are shown below:

Half round  
This is probably the most common and widely used gutter profile 
used in the UK. It gives good flow when laid to the correct fall, 
with little sediment build up. 
 
High capacity/Deep half round/storm flow 
Similar in appearance to half round gutter but with a much 
deeper profile. It is slightly elliptical in shape and generally used 
where the roof area is large or steep angled. Specifically 
designed for high volume flow rate. 
 
Square Section 
This type of gutter became very popular in the 1980s and 1990s 
and it is still used today on new build dwellings as well as 
replacement gutters. Caution should be exercised when 
replacing square section gutters or adding to existing systems as 
not all manufacturer’s gutters and fittings are interchangeable. 
Some makes are no longer available and will not fit modern 
equivalent shapes. 
Square section has almost twice the capacity of half round 
section and flow rates are acceptable when laid to the correct 
manufacturer’s falls but it can silt up very quickly because of its 
flat bottom. It requires regular cleaning. 
 
Ogee (O. G. or ornamental gutter) 
A modern adaptation of a Victorian design, ogee guttering is 
used to very good effect on both old and new buildings alike. 
Modern buildings benefit from the period styling whist on 
refurbishments and historical renovations, ogee offers a 
lightweight and long-lasting alternative to cast iron gutters. 
Again, caution should be exercised when adding to existing 
gutter systems as each manufacturer tends to have their own 
designs and many are not interchangeable.

AC1.5 Identify the different types of rainwater pipework used with 
gutter systems on dwellings 
There are 2 rainwater pipe profiles. These are: 
 
Round section  
 
Square section 
Round rainwater pipes 
Round rainwater pipes can be used with all forms of PVCu gutter systems. 
Most manufacturer’s use 68mm diameter pipe. 
 
Square rainwater pipes 
Usually used with square section guttering systems. Most manufacturer’s use 
the same size (65mm square) and so are interchangeable. 
 
Other rainwater pipework materials 
Cast iron 
Cast iron rain water pipes are specifically made for use with cast iron gutter 
systems. Jointing is usually done using a paint and putty method to create a water 
tight seal. Cast iron rainwater pipes are available in 1.8m lengths and come with a 
socket at one end. Attached to the socket are ears that are used to fix the rainwater 
pipes to the wall in conjunction with wooden spacers, known as bobbins. Bobbins 
are used to stand the Rainwater pipe away from the wall. See drawing left. 
Lead  
Lead pipes have been used for hundreds of years as a method of taking 
rainwater water away from buildings. Nowadays, its use is restricted 
to church and cathedral use and buildings of historic and architectural 
importance. Many church restorations employ specialist lead working 
companies to fabricate exact replicas of exiting lead pipework. This can 
be achieved by casting, lead welding or bossing lead sheet into the 
required shape.

There are seven Assessment Criteria to this Learning Outcome: 
AC2.1. Identify the factors which are used to determine the type (size) of gutter system used on a 
dwelling. 
AC2.2. Identify the jointing procedures for gutter systems. 
AC2.3. Identify the jointing procedures for rainwater pipework materials. 
AC2.4. State the purpose of components used in an eaves gutter system. 
AC2.5. State how building features determine gutter bracket selection for buildings. 
AC2.6. State the purpose of components used in rainwater pipework. 
AC2.7. Identify the factors which are used to determine the type (size) of gutter system used on a 
dwelling. 
AC2.1 Identify the factors which are used to determine the type (size) 
of gutter system used on a dwelling. 
Before a gutter system can be chosen, there are factors that must be taken into account. It must be 
remembered that a gutter system to work effectively must be large enough to carry away the expected flow 
of water at any point on the system. Poor sizing of the system, design and installation can often lead to 
problems with gutters overflowing and causing damage to the building structure.  
Rainfall intensity  
In England, the North-West region has the greatest rainfall at around 1.8 – 2.0m of rainfall per year. Parts of 
Scotland have even greater rainfall at around 3.5m. The driest region of the UK is the South-East with only 
around 0.5m per year. These figures show rainfall as an overall event over a 12 month period. The figures, 
however change dramatically when rainfall over a 2 minute period single event are investigated. Essex, in 
the South-East has more rainfall in a 2m intense storm event at 0.022l/s/m2 than Cumbria with 0.014l/s/m2. 
This is known as rainfall intensity and must be used when calculating the size of the gutter system. 
Information and figures relating to rainfall intensity can be found in BSEN12056-3:2000. 
Roof area 
 The volume of water 
discharging from any 
roof is dependent on 
the area of the roof in 
m2 and the angle of the 
roof in degrees of pitch. 
A roof with 45o pitch 
will have a greater area

than a roof of 30o pitch. The angle of the roof will also increase the velocity of the water flowing from the 
roof. Look at the drawing above. 
The drawing shows two roofs, each with a span or width of 7m, but the roof on the left is pitched at 30o and 
the roof on the right is pitched at 45o. Using the calculation below taken from BSEN12056-3:2000, we can 
calculate the area of the each of these roofs. We will assume that both roofs have a length of 10m: 
Effective Maximum roof area (allowance for wind):

This clearly shows that roof b) has a greater roof area than roof a)  and so will discharge a greater amount of 
rainfall, but we can simplify this even further.

roofs again: 
This time, we will use the table from BR AD H3, which gives the pitch factors. By applying the pitch factor, 
the area of the roof can be calculated sufficiently to allow a design flow rate in l/s/m2 to be calculated. This 
works only if the roof pitch is known.

Once the rea of the roof has been calculated, this can be applied to the calculation for the expected rainwater 
run off for the area of the roof. Although BSEN12056-3:2000 gives the expected rainfall in l/s/m2 for different 
areas, a generally accepted figure of 0.0208l/s/m2 can be applied:

Running outlet position 
A running outlet is the link between the guttering system and the below 
ground drainage system in use via the rainwater pipe (RWP). At 
maximum flow conditions, it is purposely designed to be able to 
discharge the water flow from the gutter to the RWP from two 
directions. 
When a severe rain storm event occurs, gutters very quickly fill with 
water. The more running outlets that the gutter system has, the less 
likely that the gutter will overflow.

Positioning of the outlets is an important aspect of gutter system design. If running outlets are placed at the 
end of a gutter run, then the outlet will only work at 50% of its actual handling capacity, since they are 
designed to be able to cope with water flow from two directions. Running outlets work much better when 
placed towards the centre of a gutter run than at the end. Look at the drawing below: 
 
The fall of the gutter 
For a gutter to be effective in removing rainwater from a building, it must be laid with a slight fall to 
In drawing A, the outlet is placed at one end of a gutter 
run. Here, the outlet will have to cope with all of the 
water from the roof and because the water is only 
approaching from one direction, there is a very good 
chance that the gutter will overflow during a severe 
storm. Remember, running outlets are designed for 
rain water in two (2) directions and only one direction 
is being used. So, effectively only 50% of the outlet has 
to cope with 100% of the rainwater. 
 
 
In drawing B, Running outlets are placed at either end 
(A and B). This is better in terms of water flow rate. 
Here, the outlets can easily handle the water run-off 
from the roof because there are two running outlets. 
However, with each outlet running only at 50% 
capacity, there is effectively only one running outlet 
discharge. A much better alternative in this instance 
would be to place one running outlet in the centre of 
the gutter run (shown by the dashed line at point C). 
 
 
 
Drawing C shows the best positioning of running 
outlets. Now each running outlet is handling 50% of the 
expected rainwater flow and both are working with 
water flowing in two directions. This means that each 
side of the running outlets is only having to cope with 
25% of the expected storm flow from the roof.

encourage the water to flow towards the running outlet. Too shallow a fall and the water will ‘pool’ in the 
gutter reducing the gutters potential flow handling capacity and this encourage silt build-up. Too steep an 
angle and the water will run too fast, which may cause the water to overflow from the gutter.  
British Standard BSEN12056-3:2000 advises that the fall of the gutter should be between 1mm/m and 
3mm/m. It also advises that the angle of fall of the gutter should not be so steep that the rainwater misses 
the front edge of the gutter as it discharges off the roof. Most gutter manufacturers (but not all) state that a 
fall of 1:600 or 25mm in every 15m will meet this requirement. A small number of manufacturers use a fall 
ratio of 1:350 or 25mm in every 8m. Both of these fall ratios will ensure that the water flows effectively and 
the gutter works to its maximum capacity. 
Changes of direction 
Changes in direction in guttering systems are often unavoidable due to the design of the roof. Angles as low 
as 10o can effectively slow the water flow down to the point where the gutters upstream of the angle begin 
to fill with water. Installing a 90o angle will reduce the effectiveness of the gutter to discharge water by 15%. 
This, in effect, reduces the area of roof that the gutter can cope with and the more angles that are added 
further reduces the gutters handling capacity. 
Customer preference 
Most customers will have some idea of the type of look they want their gutter system to have. Rainwater 
Flow rates across the range of gutter profiles is fairly consistent, although square section profile and deep 
half round have better capacities than half round and OG profiles. There are a wide range of colours available 
including white, black, brown, grey and green. 
AC2.2 Identify the jointing procedures for gutter systems 
Jointing PVCu gutters 
PVCu gutters use a snap-fit clip retaining system to hold the gutters in place. Making a watertight joint is an 
easy task: 
1. 
Cut the gutter to the required 
length using a hacksaw or fine-tooth wood 
saw. 
2. 
Remove all burrs. 
3. 
Insert the gutter into the joint up to 
the beginning of the expansion allowance 
gap. This allows for the expansion of the 
gutter. Do not insert all the way to the back 
stop. 
4. 
Make sure that the gutter is

installed underneath the back retaining clip and pull the gutter downwards into the joint while pushing the 
front retaining clip over the top of the gutter. 
Jointing Extruded Aluminium gutters 
Unlike PVCu gutters, extruded aluminium gutters do not use a single joint design and each manufacturer 
tends to design their own system that is unique to that gutter profile. In general, most jointing systems are 
based loosely around: 
1. A clip jointing system where silicone sealant is used to make the joint; or, 
2. A socket and spigot system using either gutter bolts or self-tapping screws. Again, silicone sealant is 
used to make the joint water tight. 
Jointing Cast Iron gutters 
Cast iron gutters are jointed by using the traditional socket and spigot method where the spigot fits inside 
the socket with a suitable jointing medium (usually bitumen paint and linseed oil putty) used to make a 
watertight joint. The joint is secured using zinc coated round head gutter bolts. To make a successful cast 
iron gutter joint: 
1. Prepare the inside of the socket and the outside of the spigot by applying a coat of black bitumen 
paint. 
2. Apply a thick bead of linseed oil putty to the socket. 
3. Place the spigot inside the socket and squeeze the two halves together. 
4. Push a gutter bolt through the holes and hand tighten the nut. 
5. Using a screwdriver, tighten the gutter bolt. Do not overtighten as this may cause the cast iron to 
crack. 
6. Clean off the excess putty inside and out and paint the joint (inside and out) with a coat of black 
bitumen paint. 
Note: Special silicon sealant for jointing Cast Iron gutters is available. This is preferred when installing new 
cast iron gutters. 
AC2.3 Identify the jointing procedures for rainwater pipework 
materials 
Jointing PVCu Rainwater pipes 
PVCu rainwater pipes and fittings use solvent weld cement to hold the joints 
together. The system is shown right:  
Making a solvent weld joint is a fairly simple process but it must be remembered that 
solvent cement contains dangerous solvents and care must be taken to ensure that

17
it is used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. It should not be used without first writing a risk 
assessment to assess the risks to the operative. In general: 
1. Do not smoke, eat or drink while using solvent cement products. 
2. Only use in a well ventilated space or outdoors. 
3. Do not get solvent cement on your hands and avoid contact with the eyes. 
4. If you feel overcome by the fumes, you must remove yourself to outside as soon as possible. 
5. Solvent cement is flammable. Do not use any naked flames. 
To make a solvent cement joint on PVCu pipes and fittings: 
1. Cut the pipe to the required length using a finepoint wood saw or hacksaw. 
2. Socket joints: 
a. Apply solvent cement to the inside of the socket first. This will allow a little time before the 
air gets to the cement and begins to cure it. Apply the cement lengthways in the joint. 
b. Apply solvent cement to the spigot. 
3. Spigot joints: 
a. Apply solvent cement to the inside of the pipe first. This will allow a little time before the air 
gets to the cement and begins to cure it. The inside of the pipe in this instance acts as the 
socket. Apply the cement lengthways in the joint. 
b. Apply solvent cement to the spigot of the fitting. 
4. Push the fitting and the pipe together with a twisting motion. This will ensure a good even covering 
of cement throughout the joint. 
5. Wipe off any excess cement with a clean dry cloth and leave the joint to set for 5 minutes. 
An alternative method of jointing would be to use the dry joint method, where pipes and fittings are simply 
pushed together without the aid of solvent cement. The joints are then sometimes secured in place by use 
of self-tapping screws. 
Jointing Extruded Aluminium Rainwater pipes 
These use a socket and spigot arrangement that are jointed using silicone sealant. The sockets are held in 
place by self-tapping screws. 
Jointing Cast Iron Rainwater pipes 
Again, cast iron uses a socket and spigot method to join rainwater pipes. These can be made by the use of 
black bitumen paint and linseed oil putty. With cast iron rainwater goods, the joints are usually made AFTER 
the pipework has been installed and fixed to the wall. 
1. Paint the inside of the socket and the outside of the spigot with bitumen paint.

Note: Special silicon sealant for jointing Cast Iron gutters and rainwater pipes is available. This is preferred 
when installing new cast iron rainwater pipes. 
AC2.4 State the purpose of components used in an eaves gutter 
system 
Below is a sample of gutter and rainwater fittings and their uses: 
 
 
 
Running outlet – this is used to 
convey rainwater from the gutter 
system to the drain via the 
rainwater pipe 
Gutter angles – changes direction 
of the gutter to suit the roof and 
gutter designs. There are many 
angles available including: 
 
90o 
 
135o 
 
110o 
Gutter union – used to join 
lengths of gutter together. They 
also act as a gutter bracket as 
they are fixed to the fascia board. 
 
 
 
External gutter cap end – these 
are used to stop the rainwater 
from spilling from the gutter 
system at the end of a gutter run. 
Internal gutter fitting cap end – 
these are used to cap off fittings. 
They are ideal for converting 
running 
outlets 
to 
stop-end 
outlets. 
Specialist gutter adapters – these 
are used when converting from 
one gutter profile to another. The 
image shows a converter from 
half round PVCu to cast iron OG 
gutters. 
 
AC2.5 State how building features determine gutter bracket selection 
for buildings

brackets and clips and their uses on buildings: 
 
 
Fascia brackets – these fix 
directly to the facia board of a 
building. The gutter is simply 
clipped in place.  
 
 
 
 
Rafter irons – also called rafter 
brackets, these are used where 
the rafters are exposed without 
the use of facia or soffit boards. 
They are made from zinc coated 
steel and screw directly to the top 
or side of the rafter. 
Rise and fall irons – these are 
used where there are no exposed 
rafters or facia board. They are 
installed into the brickwork joints 
of the building and adjusted to 
give the correct fall by raising or 
lowering the gutter bracket by 
the 10mm screw threaded rod. 
Mainly 
used 
on 
older 
and 
listed/historic buildings. 
AC2.6 State the purpose of components used in rainwater pipework 
 
 
 
Offsets – often referred to as the 
‘swan neck’, this is used to connect 
the running outlet to the rainwater 
Angles – can be used to make 
offsets. Generally used for changes 
of direction of rainwater pipes. 
Branches – used for connecting 
two rainwater pipes into one.

usually made from two 135o bends. 
There several angles available, 
including 90o, 135o and 112.5o. 
 
 
 
 
Shoes – these are fitted at the base 
of Rainwater pipes where the 
water is discharging into a gulley. 
Hopper heads – these are often 
used to collect rainwater from flat 
roofs or where two rainwater 
pipes converge at the same point. 
They are connected to a rainwater 
pipe 
Specialist connectors – these are 
used to connect the rainwater 
pipe to the drainage system. There 
several different types available.

There are six Assessment Criteria to this Learning Outcome: 
AC5.1. 
Identify how expansion and contraction may be catered for in PVC-U gravity rainwater 
systems. 
AC5.2. 
State the positioning and fixing requirements of gutter system components 
AC5.3. 
Identify how to install lengths of PVC-U gutter and make joints to gutter systems 
AC5.4. 
Identify how to select brackets for rainwater pipework and space them at appropriate 
intervals. 
AC5.5. 
Identify suitable methods for making new rainwater pipework connections to the drainage 
system 
AC5.6. 
Identify suitable methods for making new PVC-U pipework connections into existing rainwater 
pipework 
AC5.1 Identify how expansion and contraction may be catered for in 
PVC-U gravity rainwater systems 
PVCu has a large expansion rate when 
compared to other gutter materials. 
Gutters and rainwater pipes expand by 
0.06mm/m/oC. This can lead to the 
gutter movement and joint leakage if the 
expansion is not accommodated for. 
Gutter fittings have a thermal expansion 
mark on the joint. This is the point where 
the gutter is installed to and allows for 
around 10mm of expansion up to the 
gutter stop, preventing joint leakage. 
AC5.2 State the positioning and fixing requirements of gutter system 
components 
a. Gutter brackets – Please refer to 
Learning Outcome 2, AC2.5 State how 
building features determine gutter 
bracket selection for buildings for the 
uses of gutter brackets.

and 150mm before gutter angle (internal and external types). See also AC5.3 Identify how to 
install lengths of PVC-U gutter and make joints to gutter systems. Facia brackets should be 
screwed to the fascia with a 40mm x 10 zinc plated screw. Fascia brackets for cast iron gutters 
are also available. 
 
Rafter brackets – since most rafters are installed at 600mm centres, these should be fixed 
at every rafter for PVCu gutter systems. For cast iron gutters, there should be at least 2 
brackets per 1.8m length of gutter. 
 
drive-in types (rise and fall) brackets – rise and fall brackets should be positioned to suit the 
material that the gutter is made from. For PVCu gutters, they should be positioned in line 
with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. For cast iron gutter, at least two brackets 
per 1.8m length of gutter. 
b. 
Running outlets – 
these should be positioned 
to align with the gullies at 
ground level. 
c.

AC5.3 Identify how to install lengths of PVC-U gutter and make joints 
to gutter systems 
Pre-installation planning 
Before gutters are installed, it Is a good idea to conduct a pre-installation survey: 
 
New installations/new build properties:  
o Check that the gutter type and profile chosen will be adequate for the size of the roof and 
expected rainwater run-off. 
o Check that the fascia board is installed and the gullies are in the correct position. 
o Check that the under felt is in place. 
 
Existing installations: 
o Establish the type of drainage system being used and whether it is suitable for the rainwater 
pipework. 
o If any soakaways are being used, these should be tested to ensure they are fit for purpose 
and not backing up or flooding. 
o Check with the customer to see whether the existing gutter was functioning correctly and 
where there may be problem spots on the system. 
o Check with the customer to ensure the correct colour and profile are being installed. 
o Check that the gutter type and profile chosen will be adequate for the size of the roof and 
expected rainwater run-off. 
o Remove the existing gutters and check the fascia board for any signs of damage or rot. 
o Check to ensure that the building structure is sound where the rainwater pipes are being 
positioned. 
Installing gutters  
 
Gutters should be laid to a fall of 1:600. 
Measure the length where the gutter is to 
be installed and calculate the required 
fall. 
 
Fix gutter brackets at the high points on 
the system. If the high points are internal 
or external corners, then the brackets 
should be fixed 150mm from where the 
end of the fitting is. (see drawing right). 
 
Position the running outlet over the gully using a plumb-line or string-line and fix the outlet so as

30
to give the required fall calculated 
earlier (see drawing below).  Using a 
level ensures that the gutter will 
have the required the required fall 
towards the outlet. 
  Now, fasten a string line between 
the facia bracket at the high point 
and the running outlet. The line 
needs to be tight to ensure that 
there is no sagging. The line will be 
used to position the rest of the fascia 
brackets. 
  Fascia brackets should be fixed 
along the length of the string line at 
intervals of between 750mm and 1m, 
depending on whether the area 
suffers from heavy snow fall. In 
general, a distance of 800mm is 
usually used. Always check with the 
manufacturer’s 
instructions. 
Use 
40mm x 10 zinc plated screws to fix 
the fascia brackets. 
 For buildings without fascia boards: gutter 
brackets can be fixed using either galvanised steel top 
or side fitted rafter irons on which are fitted the fascia 
brackets. These should be spaced every rafter or as 
required by the manufacturer’s instructions. They are 
shown in position in the drawing left. 
  For buildings without fascia boards or exposed 
rafters: Drive in rise and fall 
irons can be used. These are 
either built into the wall or 
driven in at the appropriate 
point in the brickwork. 
Manufacturer’s gutter fascia 
bracket 
spacing 
requirements 
should 
be 
observed.

 Once all fascia brackets have been installed,  
and working away from the running outlet, the 
gutter can be put into the fascia brackets and 
clipped into place by pulling the front of the 
gutter and the bracket downwards together. 
Make sure that the gutter is clipped into place 
at the back of the gutter first. The same 
method is used for making the gutter joints. 
Ensure the joint retaining clip is clipped 
properly over the gutter joints. This is shown 
in the drawing left. Do not insert the gutter 
beyond the expansion point in the fitting. Start 
at the joint on the running outlet and work 
away from that point.  
 Ensure that the distance between joints is 
measured carefully, taking into account the 
expansion points. 
 Remember to support cap ends with a 
fascia bracket no more than 150mm away from the end of the fitting. 
AC5.4 Identify how to select brackets for rainwater pipework and 
space them at appropriate intervals 
Installing rainwater pipes 
 Installing 
rainwater pipes can 
be a little tricky and it 
is 
advisable 
to 
fabricate and install 
the swan neck bend 
that 
connects 
the 
running outlet of the 
gutter 
to 
the 
rainwater pipe first. 
The swan neck is made from 2 x 122.5o bends that are joined together so that, once the swan neck 
is installed, the rainwater pipe is the correct pipe clip distance from the wall. 
 
Measure the distance between the spigot on the swan neck and the connection to drain and carefully 
cut a length of rainwater pipe to suit.

 
Install the pipework and mark the position of the pipe clips, ensuring the correct pipe clip distances 
are used. These are shown in the table above. 
 
Choose the correct clip for the installation. There are several different pipe clip styles and these 
mostly depend on the manufacturer of the pipe. Some are more robust than others. It is possible to 
use pipe clips from other manufacturers, although there can be a variation in the colours. The sizes 
are the same, irrespective of the manufacturer. 
 
Drill the pipe clip holes using a suitable electric/cordless drill and drill bit.  
 
Fasten the rainwater pipe back to the wall using suitable plastic wall plugs and 50mm x 10 zinc plated 
screws. 
AC5.5 Identify suitable methods for making new rainwater pipework 
connections to the drainage system 
a. Rain water pipes can terminate over the top of a gully via a rainwater shoe 
b. Direct connection to drainage bend using a suitable drain connector 
c. Direct connection to gulley. The pipe must terminate below the grate but above the water line of 
the gully. 
d. Direct connection to a soakaway. A typical soakaway is shown below 
 
Connection of a rainwater pipe to a soakaway drain 
AC5.6 Identify suitable methods for making new PVC-U pipework 
connections into existing rainwater pipework 
On existing installations of gutters and rainwater pipes, where possible, all rainwater pipework should be 
replaced with new. However, there may be situations when new rainwater pipe must be connected to the 
existing rainwater installation.  
a. To existing cast iron pipework: fittings are available to convert existing cast iron pipes to PVCu. These 
adapters are fitted over the open end spigot of cast iron pipe where new PVCu rainwater pipe is to

be installed BELOW the existing cast iron rain water pipe. The cast iron pipe fits inside the adapter. 
Where PVCu is to be installed above the cast iron pipe, then the PVCu may be inserted into a suitable 
cast iron socket and the joint completed using suitable silicone sealant or bitumen paint/putty. 
b. To existing PVC-U pipework: in most cases, new PVCu pipe will fit existing PVCu rainwater pipes. The 
sizes are compatible.

There are three Assessment Criteria to this Learning Outcome: 
AC7.1. 
Identify how to carry out routine checks on gravity rainwater systems as part of a periodic 
maintenance programme 
AC7.2. 
State the procedures for dealing with defects in gravity rainwater systems 
AC7.3. 
Identify the procedures for safely handling gravity rainwater system components that may 
be contaminated with foul waste 
AC7.1 Identify how to carry out routine checks on gravity rainwater 
systems as part of a periodic maintenance programme 
Conducting a visual inspection of a guttering system should be completed as part of an on-going maintenance 
programme. Some defects will be obvious at ground level, such as leaks, but others may need a closer 
inspection at height. 
Remember when working at height to follow the correct health and safety procedures as detailed in Section 
1 – J/602/2479 Understand and carry out safe working practices in building services engineering, Learning Outcome 10 
Know the methods of safely using access equipment in the building services industry. 
Faults to look for are listed below: 
 
Leaking joints  
 
Incorrect falls  
 
Blocked gutters  
 
Incorrectly clipped gutters and rainwater pipes  
 
Incorrect gutter type and size  
 
Vandalism and vehicle damage to rainwater pipes at ground level  
AC7.2 State the procedures for dealing with defects in gravity 
rainwater systems 
 
Leaking joints – these not only create more damage to the property but can be annoying. Leaking 
joints require rectification works. The method of rectification will depend on the type of gutter and 
the materials that they are made from 
o PVCu – most modern PVCu jointing systems use generic gutter and rainwater pipe sizes, 
especially for half round profiles. However, other profiles, such as square section and ogee 
are not always compatible. In many cases the manufacturers produce compatibility charts 
with other manufacturers to help guide the installer in choosing a viable alternative. 
Wherever possible, like-for-like fittings should be used. Older PVCu profiles are more difficult

to assess, since the gutter and fittings may no longer be available. In these cases, it may 
require that the whole system be replaced with new.  
In some instances, the joint may be repaired by replacing the defective rubber joint seal. 
These are usually available from plumbers merchants. Makeshift joints using silicon sealant 
should not be attempted because the joint will leak again as soon as thermal movement 
takes place. 
o Cast iron joints – the joints themselves are usually quite easy to repair and involves removing 
the old gutter bolt, parting the joint and remaking the joint after cleaning the joint of the old 
jointing medium. Care should be exercised not to create too much movement as this may 
make other joints leak further down the run. 
 
Incorrect falls – again, incorrect falls will require work to be carried out to ensure that the water 
flows in the right direction towards the outlet. Back-falls often result in water spilling over the gutter 
creating property damage. Correcting the fall of a gutter will require the gutter being removed and 
the fascia brackets re-aligning with the correct fall. 
 
Blocked gutters – blocked gutters create two problems: 
o They cause water to overflow from the gutter 
o The add weight, which creates stress on the fascia brackets 
Clearing blockages is an easy task to perform that prolongs the life of the gutter system. The gutter 
should be tested with water, once they have been cleared to assess that there are no underlying 
problems that are causing the blockages to appear in the fist place. 
 
Incorrectly clipped gutters and rainwater pipes – incorrectly spaced fascia brackets causes many 
problems with gutter systems. By not using the manufacturers correcting spacing recommendations, 
gutters begin to sag between the brackets, pulling the gutter out of the joints and creating leaks. 
Other damage is caused by wind and, because the gutter is not adequately clipped, excessive 
movement can cause the gutter to break. Rainwater pipes, too, suffer similar problems because of 
incorrect clip spacing. 
Again, for fascia brackets to be correctly spaced, it may require the gutters to be removed and the 
fascia brackets re-aligned correctly. 
 
Incorrect gutter type and size – not an obvious problem as the gutter works adequately for the 
majority of the time. However, in periods of heavy rain, the gutter may overflow despite not showing 
any visible faults or defects. This usually becomes a problem after a building has had a major 
extension and the roof area has increased. The only way to be sure that the gutter size is correct is 
by taking measurements and performing the calculations shown earlier in the unit. 
 
Vandalism and vehicle damage to rainwater pipes at ground level – on public buildings, vandalism 
to rainwater pipes can be a major problem. In most cases PVCu is not strong enough to withstand a 
determined vandal attack and other, stronger materials should be considered as replacement.

AC7.3 Identify the procedures for safely handling gravity rainwater 
system components that may be contaminated with foul waste 
Where rainwater system components come into contact with the foul drainage system, careful consideration 
must be given as to how we handle these components. Where possible, the following points should be 
observed: 
 
Human waste carries many diseases and handling components contaminated with human waste 
should be avoided where possible. Always where the correct PPE – the correct rubber gloves, eye 
protection and workwear. It may also be beneficial to consider using a face mask.  
 
Always have a bucket of hot soapy water available for washing down the equipment used and the 
PPE (gloves, goggles). Use disinfectant where necessary. 
 
Carry a well-stocked first aid kit that includes sterile wipes, and sterile waterproof adhesive dressings 
in case of injury.

There are three Assessment Criteria to this learning outcome: 
AC9.1. 
State the checks to be carried out during a visual inspection of a gravity rainwater system to 
confirm that it is ready to receive rainwater. 
AC9.2. 
State the test arrangements for gravity rainwater systems to check for leakage. 
AC9.3. 
Identify the actions that must be taken when inspection and testing reveals defects in gravity 
rainwater systems 
AC9.1 State the checks to be carried out during a visual inspection of 
a gravity rainwater system to confirm that it is ready to receive 
rainwater 
When the gutters and rainwaters have been installed, a visual inspection should be carried out prior to 
testing: 
 
Check to make sure that the gutters are free of any debris left over from the installation process. 
 
Check both the gutters and rainwater pipes to ensure that they are adequately supported throughout 
the installation and that the manufacturers recommendations have been followed. 
 
Check that the fall of the gutter is adequate to clear the rainwater without pooling. 
AC9.2 State the test arrangements for gravity rainwater systems to 
check for leakage 
Before testing 
Before testing takes place, the customer should be notified. If there is any personal customer property that 
may cause a hindrance to the testing and commissioning procedures, ask them move it to a safe location 
while the testing is completed. 
The testing procedure 
Testing should be completed using either a hose pipe or buckets of water. The water should be discharged 
on to the roof tiles at the gutters highest point(s) and not directly into the gutters as the latter can often 
splash over the gutters. Discharging the water on to the roof will cause the water to spread simulating rainfall. 
With the gutters in operation visually check that the water has a gentle flow towards the outlets and that 
pooling inside the gutter does not occur. Also check for any signs of joint leakage and that the water is 
discharging from the rainwater pipes in the correct location.

AC9.3 Identify the actions that must be taken when inspection and 
testing reveals defects in gravity rainwater systems 
Sometimes, defective installation and components are revealed by the testing process. Any problems that 
do arise must be dealt with swiftly: 
 
Dealing with systems that do not meet correct installation requirements – poor installation is often 
the cause of problems with gutters and rainwater pipes. Problems such as too much fall, too little 
fall or no fall at all can cause major time concerns as the affected work must be taken down and 
reinstalled correctly. Sagging gutters too can cause aesthetic problems as well as performance 
related issues. 
 
Remedial work associated with defective gutter and pipework bracketing – as discussed earlier, 
insufficient fascia brackets and incorrectly placed pipe clips can cause gutter systems to fail in a 
relatively short space of time. Again, the affected work must be taken down and reinstalled correctly.  
 
Remedial work associated with leakage from systems – most leaks on new installations are caused 
by three very common issues: 
o Incorrectly jointed gutters 
o Defective components 
o Incorrectly positioned and jointed rainwater pipe fittings. 
Of these three, incorrectly jointed gutters accounts for the vast majority of the problems 
encountered. This is usually due to incorrect measurements being taken and the gutter being cut too 
short for the gutter union or fitting. It is rare for gutter components to be supplied defective and 
when they are, most are due to missing sealing rubbers in the joints. Rainwater sockets and fittings 
are often fitted upside down with the socket facing downwards allowing water to run down the 
outside of the pipe. In all cases, the rectification is very simple to complete.
