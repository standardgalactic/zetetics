3. A Model of the Unified Field and of the Neutrinos 
 
Abstract: The accepted Standard Model in physics is founded on basic 
principles evolved with the advance of science over several centuries in 
order to describe observed phenomena in nature. The physical theories 
containing several ad hoc hypotheses appear consistent and complete to 
explain all measurements of physical objects and to provide satisfactory 
explanations of physical observations. Besides this, some discontinuities in 
physics exist and many fundamental problems remain unsolved. There is a 
profound discrepancy between the classical and the quantum theories. The 
accepted theory of gravity is incompatible with the other interactions and 
the problems of neutrinos are not well understood. Therefore, a New Model 
including new principles and centralizing the covariant Unified Field (UF) 
consisting of the electromagnetic and gravitational field has been 
formulated. The UF is generated by two kinds of invariant Maxwell charges 
which are two different attributes of the four elementary particles. Within 
the New Model, the source quantization is recognised as a theoretical 
process of open particle systems in a finite domain  and the neutrinos are 
explained.

 = mass defect of the body, is also verified with the free fall of different 
materials by the author in Ref. [1]. The New Model uses the source 
quantization of the fundamental field UF within a theory of open systems in 
finite space-time domains  together with seven new fundamental 
hypotheses, Ref. [6]. In many accepted physical theories however, the 
assumption of closed systems is fundamental and no restriction of physical 
description to finite space–time domains are usual. Analytical mechanics 
then allow a conversion from Lagrange to Hamilton formalism with all its 
advanced features and far-reaching consequences, Ref. [2]. In the quantum 
theory one is dealing with Hamilton operators in Hilbert spaces and the 
quantization is performed in this frame, Ref. [3]. Another characteristic of 
the quantum theories is the universality of Planck’s constant h with 
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. It is not our intention here to accept 
these basic assumptions unconditionally. We want see how they appear in 
physics or perhaps why it is not appropriate to use these terms. The New 
Model of the UF is constructed as a covariant theory of electromagnetism 
and gravity. The starting point is the Lagrange formalism in finite space-
time domains in a mathematically well defined way, Ref. [5] and the 
covariant formulation of electromagnetism, Ref. [4]. Beside the elementary 
electric charges, the elementary gravitational charges with both signs are 
consequently set up for the four stable particles electron (e), positron (p), 
proton (P) and the negative charges proton = elton (E) in complete analogy 
to the electric charges. This four particle are the sources = quanta of the UF. 
The physical imagination of repulsive gravitational forces, e.g. between e 
and p as well as between P and E, is unusual but it is compatible within a 

 
 
3
consistent formulation of a field theory and it allows to describe the 
properties of neutrinos as it is shown in this paper.  
The investigation starts with the Lagrangian of the UF the New Model. On 
this basis, the general formulation is fixed, Ref. [5], by:  
- 
The limitation of physical description on finite space-time domains with 
a unique Riemann’s type of metric where the space and time is 
homogenous, the space is isotopic and all systems are open physical 
systems,  
- 
The UF propagates with a unified velocity c, 
- 
The canonical coordinates of particles are principally undeterminable 
and 
- 
A separation principle for particle systems in very small and very large 
distances.  
The unique Riemann’s type of metric is given by the fundamental constant c 
of the UF and the invariant infinitesimal distance ds is defined with  
(ds) 2  = dx dx  = (dx 2
1 +dx 2
2 +dx 2
3 )-(cdt) 2 .  
(1) 
The space-time continuum is essentially Euclidian and it is represented by 
the Minkowski space. The manifest covariant Unified Field is consisting of 
the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field and propagates with c. 
The sources of the UF are the four stable, point-like, structure-less particles 
(e, p, P and E) with two elementary Maxwell charges. They are elementary 
particles (EP) and the quanta of the field. The UF is the only interaction 
between these particles. 
The manifestly covariant UF is described with the four-vector potential A  
and the four-current j :

j    = 0, the charge conservation and  
(3) 
A  = 0, the conservation of the field properties = Lorentz gauge.  (4) 
The wave equation in a particle free space with j   0 is  
A  = 0. 
 
(5) 
With the index convention (e) = 1, (p) = 2, (P) = 3 and (E) = 4, the 
distribution of the two elementary e-charges onto the four EP is on one hand 


)
(e
i .ds = + q i  with {q 1 = -q; q 2  = +q; q 3  = +q; q 4  = -q}.

On the other, the distribution of the four elementary g-charges is 

S

(g

whereby m e  is the electron mass, m P  the proton mass and G = g 2 /4 is 
the Newtonian constant. The integrals are performed on a closed surface S 
containing one elementary particle i with the charges q i  and g i  and E

(e

and E

 are the corresponding static e-field and g-field. The value of 
Newton’s constant G is  
G = g 2 /4 =  6.576(6)x10

This value is ~1.5% less than the value given by literature of the 
gravitational constant G CODATA  which is an averaged value of G = G/(1-

(9) 
The basic implication of Eqs. (6) and (7) is that they fix not only the values 
of invariant quantities of the UF mathematically but determine also 

 
 
5
axiomatically the constants of nature. Mathematically the UF is connected 
to the invariants c, q i  and g i . In physics we have the constant of nature c, 
q, G, m e  and m P ; they are quantities which never change. For instance, if 
an electron meets a positron, they build indeed a bound state but they can 
not annihilate each other. The bound state (e,p) has to be identified with the 
“mass-less” electron-neutrino 
e  and the bound state (P,E) with the “mass-
less” proton-neutrino 
P . The bound states of (e,P), (p,E), (e,p) and (P,E) 
are connected to the so-called separation principle of the source = quanta of 
the Unified Field and build the neutrino theory. 
Continuing the explanation of the field properties, A  and j  can be 
expressed in terms of the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields. The

The covariant field equations of the e-field are also known in a non-
covariant form as the Maxwell equations. The corresponding equations for 
the gravitational field differ solely by a minus sign of g  and j g

 F g  = - g i (E g +

(25) 
All quantities are defined in finite space-time domains . The static 
equations (24) and (17) are valid in a finite space volume V. 
In case of the electromagnetism, the experimental verification of Maxwell 
equations are done with Coulomb’s, Ampère’s, Biot&Savart’s and 
Faraday’s laws. For the gravity, only Newton’s law in Eq. (24) is verified 
and therefore .E g  = - g  too. The other field equations of gravity are 
derived from the postulated covariant properties of the UF and are 
consequences within the New Model. An experimental proof of the field 
equation has yet to be done. In any case, they are different from A.

The electrostatic field and the static gravitational field are conservative 
fields. But, B e  and B g  are non-conservative fields unless there are no

The continuity equations, Eq. (15), are simultaneously conservation 
equations for the net electric and the net gravitational charges and for the 
particle numbers. 
According to Eq. (18), we are now able to formulate the static conditions for 
the sources quantum of the UF in a finite space domain V,

allow then to move the static conditions to any finite space-time domain  
in the Minkowski space. The Eq. (27) formulates the isoperimetric 
subsidiary conditions of the variation problems within the New Model if the 
field quantities of the four EP are subject to variation, see Ref. [12]. The 
continuity equations determine corresponding natural boundary conditions 
for these field quantities. The Eq. (27) is an integral representation of the 
source quantization and corresponds to the principle uncertain canonical 
coordinates of the four elementary particles. 
It is worth noticing the essential difference between the New Model and the 
Quantum Mechanics. E. Schrödinger has used an infinite integral with  

 
 
10 
 = *  
for an electron in the field of a proton in case of the H atom, 
* d 3 x = 1, 
(28) 
and the quantization of the eigenvalues of the Hamilton operator H  
*H d 3 x = E. 
(29) 
as quantum condition for different 
i  and discrete energies E i . 
Corresponding to the energy quantization of particle systems, the 
electromagnetic field has also to be quantized by photons with energy  
hij  = E i -E j .  
The New Model uses a finite integral, Eq. (27), for an open system and the 
eigenvalues 
i do not correspond in general to energies of a particle system. 
Furthermore, only the sources of the UF are quantized and not the field 
itself. Therefore, the discrete frequencies of the emitted radiation 
ij
 will be 
proportional to eigenvalue differences 
i-
j
 and the emission and 
absorption of light will be interpreted as a resonance process, see Ref. [7] 
and previous publications in Ref. [11]. 
After this short excursion to the difference of the principles of the Quantum 
Mechanics and the New Model, we continue the explanation of formalism.

In the following, we restrict the description to two particles in a finite space-

with the same sign of electric charges can not stay in a finite domain . 
Only the systems (e,P), (p,E), (e,p) and (P,E) can being resident in a volume

They are the most important fundamental systems corresponding to H-Atom 
and neutron (e,P) as well as to the two kinds of neutrino, (e,p) and (P,E) etc. 
The mutual interaction between the two particles depends on the relative 
four-coordinate x  = x 
i -x 
j  of the particles on one hand. On the other 
hand, if we let p  define the relative four-impulse in the “center-of-
momentum system” in the C-O-M system, the product p x  is an invariant 
quantity. Therefore, the two particle number densities and currents,

of p x  and P X , (p x ,P X ), where the P X  describes the 
motion of C-O-M system. The p x  describes the relative motion of both 
particles and leads to the interesting part of the problem. We do not want to 
consider the motion of C-O-M system with P X  and therefore, we loosely 
consider  as a function of p x  alone; and we want consider a function 
(p x ) now.  
Physical intuition allows the assumption that an (e,P) system, the H atom, as 
well as the (e,p) respectively the (P,E) systems, the neutrinos, have a time 
independent, steady ground state. The observed ionisation energies, 
E ionisation, of these ground states are 13.5 eV in case of the H atom, 2m e c 2  
for (e,p) and 2m P c 2  for (P,E). Since the steady ground states have a time 
independent electric charge distribution

(e

13 
the function (p x ) must be for x x < s 2  with a finite s 2  in each three 
case proportional to 
 ~ exp (-i h p x ), 
(34) 
with some constants h. In case of the H-atom we know the connection 
between Planck’s constant h, E ionisation: and the reduced mass  
m’ = m e m P /(m e +m P ). 
h  = (q 4 /8 x m’/E ionisation)
2
/

(35) 
We take this formula with the reduced masses  
m’ = m e /2 for (e,p)  
and  
m’ = m P /2 for (P,E)  
and we have in analogy to Eq. (35) 
h 0  = (q 4 /32c 2 )
2
/
1  = 1/4
2 x q 2 /c, and h 0 = h/387. 
(36) 
It should be mentioned that Eq. (34) does not correspond to the quantization 
of energy in the New Model. The appearance of a second basic constant h 0  
in case of neutrinos beside Planck’s constant h provides that the Planck’s 
constant cannot be universal in all microscopic processes. This statement is 
a very fundamental recognition within the Unified Field Theory. The 
meaning of h and h 0  will be clear within the variation treatment of the 
quantum condition Eq. (27) as an isoperimetric subsidiary condition in Ref. 
[12].

The two-particle systems give reason to two basic neutrinos within the UF 
theory 
e  = (e,p) and p  = (P,E).  
(39) 
The electron-neutrino e  and the proton-neutrino p  are the bound state 
of the composing particles. Because of the zero net gravitational charge, the 
neutrinos are “mass-less”. The magnetic momentums of the neutrinos also 
equals zero, because the two particles move with opposite charges on “circle 
orbits with the same velocities and radii”. The vanishing of both net charges 
in case of neutrinos indicates that the interaction radii of the neutrinos are 
comparable with their size. Since

we can assume that the electron-neutrino e  is used to build the nuclei. The 
p  can not be integrated in the nuclei because its interaction sphere is very 
small compared to the size of the nuclei. The interaction radius of p  is 
two thousand times smaller than the size of the nuclei. Since the electron-
neutrino and h 0  must be responsible for the nuclear forces, qualitatively 
some observed properties of the nuclei and the nuclear forces are 
immediately clear:  
- 
The size of the nuclei, 
- 
The distribution of charge density within the nuclei, 
- 
The saturation of nuclear forces,  
- 
The gravitational mass of a nucleus with A nucleons is m g

The neutron is a two particle state n 0  = (e,P) and can be calculated with h 0 . 
The other two-particle neutron, n 0 = (p,E) is usually called as “antineutron”.

which is connected to the instable four-particle neutron n=(e,e ,P). In 
general, the nuclear processes are determined by h 0  and by the presence of 
e  and not by Planck’s constant h, Ref. [6]. The numbers of e  are not a 
priori known within a nuclei with the mass number A. Only its gravitational 
mass is known with the number of protons, Ref. [1]. 
Now, we start an attempt for the determination of the composition of many 
particle systems consisting of charges particles and neutrinos. Anyhow, they 
build three types of stationary solutions (stationary states) of variation 
principles of open systems within the UF Theory. The three types are: 
bound states, unstable states and condensation states. The condensation 
states correspond to stationary states in a steady current of electron-
neutrinos. Such states are for instance the observed nuclear isotopes. The 
treatment of these problems with calculus of variation of open physical 
systems is the topic of a forthcoming article by the author, Ref. [12]. The 
necessary investigations of open systems are also recognised by other 
authors, Ref. [11]. But they used a completely different physical and 
mathematical basis for their techniques as the here proposed one. 
In the following, only some neutral isotopes and unstable particles are 
considered:

Remarks: The denotation of “antiparticle” used in particle physics has no 
meaning within the UF theory. Therefore, care should be taken with the 
assignments to the known denotations, e.g. K  and  

 
 
18 
K 
2  = (e ,3e ,2p ),  
as well as 

 and 

2 . The known denotations of unstable particles should 
probably be reassigned. 
The UF Theory connects the particle physics with the two fundamental 
fields. Therefore, the explanations in astrophysics are set on microscopic 
processes. The consequences stated by the New Model for the Universe 
which will be outlined by the author in Ref. [13]: Two types of stars exist; 
one type condensates with (P, 
e
, e), the other with (E, 
e
, p). These two 
types of stars exert a repulsive gravitation to each other. In a given galaxy, 
only one type is present. The proton-neutrinos 
p
 do not condensate in 
matter under normal conditions. The two kinds of neutrinos build the sought 
dark matter. All stars rotate in the same direction within the approximate 
plane of the galaxy because of the presence of the gravitational Lorentz 
force. The radii of planet orbits are not arbitrary, Ref. [8]. The “quantized” 
orbits of solar-like gravitational systems can be determined with a variation 
principle of open systems. As a consequence of the isotope dependent G AB , 
many inner planets have an iron/nickel core. Since the so called ground 
states of the H atom is solely approximately a stationary state, the two-
particle system n 0  = (P,e) radiates always electromagnetic and gravitational 
rays. The Poynting flux of moving unequal gravitational charges is not zero. 
The consequence of the instability of n 0  and n 0  leads to the collapse of 
stars, to the so-called neutron stars. If from the condensed matter all 
e
 are 
removed, and if n 0  and n 0 in both types of stars reaches the size of 
p
, then 
the proton-neutrinos react with the neutrino star and a super nova explosion

continues the time development of the universe. Each electromagnetic 
radiation incorporates the much weaker gravitational radiation. The speed of 
gravity is c and, in a recent measurement, Kopeikin observed, Ref. [9] 
c g /c = 1.06 0.21. 
The mentioned results collected here are deduced within the New Model 
without any further additional hypothesis. The utilization of gravitational 
charges, the discovery of the new constant h 0  which is responsible for 
neutrinos and nuclear forces show the power of the UF Theory. The 
differences between the principles of the accepted Standard Model and the 
New Model are remarkable and are discussed by the author in Ref. [6].
