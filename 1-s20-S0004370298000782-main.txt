The series “Studies in Big Data” (SBD) publishes new developments and advances
in the various areas of Big Data- quickly and with a high quality. The intent is to
cover the theory, research, development, and applications of Big Data, as embedded
in the ﬁelds of engineering, computer science, physics, economics and life sciences.
The books of the series refer to the analysis and understanding of large, complex,
and/or distributed data sets generated from recent digital sources coming from
sensors or other physical instruments as well as simulations, crowd sourcing, social
networks or other internet transactions, such as emails or video click streams and
other. The series contains monographs, lecture notes and edited volumes in Big
Data spanning the areas of computational intelligence including neural networks,
evolutionary computation, soft computing, fuzzy systems, as well as artiﬁcial
intelligence, data mining, modern statistics and Operations research, as well as
self-organizing systems. Of particular value to both the contributors and the
readership are the short publication timeframe and the world-wide distribution,
which enable both wide and rapid dissemination of research output.

Preface
The book is devoted to the analysis of big data in order to extract from these data
hidden patterns necessary for making decisions about the rational behavior of
complex systems with the different nature that generate this data. To solve these
problems, a group of new methods and tools is used, based on the self-organization
of computational processes, the use of crisp and fuzzy cluster analysis methods,
hybrid neural-fuzzy networks, and others. The book solves various practical
problems. In particular, for the tasks of 3D image recognition, large-scale neural
networks with applications for Deep Learning systems were used. Application of
hybrid neuro-fuzzy networks for analyzing stock markets was presented. The
analysis of big historical, economic and physical data revealed the hidden Fibonacci
pattern about the course of systemic world conﬂicts and their connection with the
Kondratieff big economic cycles and the Schwabe-Wolf solar activity cycles.
Now we give a brief description of the main practical problems solved in this
book related to the intellectual analysis of big data.
First of all large dimensions of modern neural networks with applications for
3-D images recognition and automatic speech recognition demanded development
of new efﬁcient training methods called Deep Learning (DL). But the most serious
drawback of deep learning networks is a problem of determination of its proper
structure and how to choose adequate number of their layers. For solution of DL
problems arising in BD novel approaches and methods are developed and presented
based on the application method of self-organization, also known as the Group
Method of Data Handling (GMDH). Several classes of hybrid GMDH—
neuro-fuzzy networks are considered algorithms of their structure synthesis based
on GMDH are suggested and analyzed. Training algorithms for hybrid deep net-
works are free from problem of gradient vanishing or explosion and besides, the
application of GMDH enables to reduce dimensionality of training DN and
accelerate the convergence of training.
Secondly, the application of hybrid GMDH- neuro-fuzzy networks for at the
stock markets is presented. Problems of images in 2-D and 3-D which also refer
stock prices forecasting to sphere of BD analytics are considered. For its solution,
v

last years convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely applied. New class of
hybrid fuzzy CNN network is suggested in which CNN VGG is used as informative
features extractor and fuzzy neural network NEFClass is used as classiﬁer. Besides,
for cutting dimensionality of classiﬁcation problem and reducing of number of feature
principal component method (PCM) was applied and investigated. Hybrid
FNN-CNN networks were successfully applied to classiﬁcation of breast tumors in
medical diagnostics. The results of FNN NEFClass for another problem human tumor
classiﬁcation and diagnostics are also presented demonstrating the efﬁciency of FNN.
Thirdly, much attention in book are paid to system analysis of global conﬂicts,
detecting hidden dependencies in world economy and forecasting on this base
global conﬂict of the 21-st century. Data on global conﬂicts from 750 B.C. up to
now were collected and analyzed and their general pattern is revealed. An attempt is
made to foresee the next global conﬂict called the conﬂict of the 21st century. Its
nature and main characteristics are analyzed. Main global threats are listed, and
their impact on ﬁve groups of countries was determined using cluster analysis. The
generalization and formalization of approaches to the recognition of global systemic
conﬂicts (C-waves) using big historical data are performed and general concept of
description and interpretation of these waves is proposed. Special attention is paid
to the class of big C-waves, which cover super-long time intervals. Their pattern is
invariant to the evolution of the nature of global conﬂicts. There has also been made
an attempt to predict these processes in the 21st century by using a metric approach.
The possible scenarios of the development of the conﬂict of the 21st century have
been constructed and analyzed.
The book is oriented, ﬁrst of all, at specialists in the ﬁelds BD analysis, com-
putational intelligence, data mining, system analysis of the world economy,
information technologies in medical diagnostics and students of specialties data
science, computational intelligence and system analysis, It will be useful also to all
specialists who intend to learn new methods and approaches in BD analytics.

Introduction
In the recent decades, due to the explosion of data accumulated and processed in all
spheres of human activity, humanity has faced a new global problem (threat), which
was called the “Information gap”. This gap is since now every 2 years mankind
doubles the volume of data produced, but processes, analyzes and comprehends
only a part of these data. Non-analyzed and unreasonable data can be interpreted as
“black information holes”, which bring to humanity many unexpected, poorly
explained events. These circumstances make the “Big Data” problem very urgent
and necessitate the development of an effective theory and practical methods for
storing, processing and analyzing these data.
Big data (BD) is data sets that are so big and complex that traditional
data-processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. Big data
challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing,
transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source.
There are a number of concepts associated with big data: originally there were three
concepts volume, variety, velocity [1]. Other concepts later attributed with big data
are veracity (i.e., how much noise is in the data) [2] and value [3].
Lately, the term “big data” tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user
behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract
value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. “There is little doubt
that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that’s not the most
relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem” [4]. Analysis of data sets can
ﬁnd new correlations to “spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and
so on” [5]. Scientists, business executives, practitioners of medicine, advertising
and governments alike regularly meet difﬁculties with large data sets in areas
including Internet search, ﬁntech, urban informatics, and business informatics.
Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, geno-
mics [6], complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research [7].
Data sets grow rapidly—in part because they are increasingly gathered by cheap
and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile
devices,
aerial
(remote
sensing),

The world’s technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly
doubled every 40 months since the 1980s [10]; as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes
(2.5  1018) of data are generated [11]. Based on an IDC report prediction, the
global data volume was growing up exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zet-
tabytes between 2013 and 2020 [12]. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163
zettabytes of data [13]. One question for large enterprises is determining who
should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization [14].
Relational database management systems and desktop statistics and software
packages to visualize data often have difﬁculty handling big data. The work may
require “massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands
of servers” [15]. What counts as “big data” varies depending on the capabilities
of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving
target. “For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the ﬁrst
time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may
take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a signiﬁcant consid-
eration” [16].
Big data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations
with a special need. Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database
management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s. For many years,
WinterCorp published a largest database report [17].
Teradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012
system. Teradata systems were the ﬁrst to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in
1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5 GB in 1991, so the deﬁnition of big data con-
tinuously evolves according to Kryder’s Law. Teradata installed the ﬁrst petabyte
class RDBMS-based system in 2007. As of 2017, there are a few dozen petabyte
class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB.
Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data. Since then, Teradata
has added unstructured data types including XML, JSON, and Avro.
CERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many
decades, usually analyzed via high performance computing (supercomputers) rather
than the commodity map-reduce architectures usually meant by the current “big
data” movement.
In 2004, Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a
similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model,
and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data.
With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and pro-
cessed in parallel (the Map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the
Reduce step). The framework was very successful [18], so others wanted to
replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of the MapReduce frame-
work was adopted by an Apache open-source project named Hadoop [19]. Apache
Spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce para-
digm, as it adds the ability to set up many operations (not just map followed by
reduce).
MIKE2.0 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges
the need for revisions due to big data implications identiﬁed in an article titled “Big
xiv
Introduction

Data Solution Offering” [20]. The methodology addresses handling big data in
terms of useful permutations of data sources, complexity in interrelationships, and
difﬁculty in deleting (or modifying) individual records [21].
Various studies since 2012 showed that a multiple-layer architecture is one
option to address the issues that big data presents. A distributed parallel architecture
distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can
dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data
into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop
frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power trans-
parent to the end user by using a front-end application server [22].
Big data analytics for manufacturing applications is marketed as a 5C archi-
tecture (connection, conversion, cyber, cognition, and conﬁguration) [23].
Data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a
shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management.
This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the
overhead time [24, 25].
Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so
much so that Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP
and Dellhave spent more than $15 billion on software ﬁrms specializing in data
management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion
and was growing at almost 10% a year: about twice as fast as the software business
as a whole [5].
Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are
4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2
billion people accessing the Internet [5]. Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1
billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people
became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world’s
effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks
was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65
exabytes in 2007 [10] and predictions put the amount of Internet trafﬁc at 667
exabytes annually by 2014 [5]. According to one estimate, one-third of the globally
stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data [26],
which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the
potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content).
Consider the main sources of Big Data.
Networking Ways of Communication Between People
on the Planet
As the development of modern means of communication between people, such as
Mobile Communications, the Internet, Social Networks and other, volumes of data
generated by people increase in an avalanche. According to the analytical studies
Introduction
xv

of the International Labor Organization at the United Nations, these changes have
the following features:
– If the number of Internet devices in the world in 1984 was at the level of 1,000,
now it has reached 15 billion, about 2.5 per every inhabitant of the Planet;
– As of 1900, the amount of human knowledge doubled every 100 years. Now,
due to global “digitalization”, they are doubled every 2 years. At the same rate,
the volume of new data produced by mankind is growing;
– This means that now for university students, the newest knowledge that they
receive during the ﬁrst year of training already in the third year becomes
obsolete;
– These changes are no longer linear in time. According to the UN, they are
exponential, and the new digital world is called exponential.
Internet of Things (IoT)
Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. Data extracted from IoT devices provides
a mapping of device interconnectivity. Such mappings have been used by the media
industry, companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and
increase media efﬁciency. IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering
sensory data, and this sensory data has been used in medical [27] and manufac-
turing [28] contexts.
Kevin Ashton, digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term
[29], deﬁnes the Internet of Things in this quote: “If we had computers that knew
everything there was to know about things—using data they gathered without any
help from us—we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce
waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or
recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.”
Information Technology
Especially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within Business Operations
as a tool to help employees work more efﬁciently and streamline the collection and
distribution of Information Technology (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and
data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT Operations Analytics (ITOA)
[30]. By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and
deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide
solutions before the problems even happen [30]. In this time, ITOA businesses were
also beginning to play a major role in systems management by offering platforms
that brought individual data silos together and generated insights from the whole
of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data.

Introduction

• Walmart handles more than 1 million customer transactions every hour, which
are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 2.5 petabytes (2560
terabytes) of data—the equivalent of 167 times the information contained in all
the books in the US Library of Congress.
• Windermere Real Estate uses location information from nearly 100 million
drivers to help new home buyers determine their typical drive times to and from
work throughout various times of the day [31].
• FICO Card Detection System protects accounts worldwide [32].
Science
• The Large Hadron Collider experiments represent about 150 million sensors
delivering data 40 million times per second. There are nearly 600 million col-
lisions per second. After ﬁltering and refraining from recording more than
99.99995% [33] of these streams, there are 100 collisions of interest per second
[34–36].
As a result, only working with less than 0.001% of the sensor stream data, the
data ﬂow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before
replication (as of 2012). This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication.
If all sensor data were recorded in LHC, the data ﬂow would be extremely hard
to work with. The data ﬂow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate, or
nearly 500 exabytes per day, before replication. To put the number in perspective,
this is equivalent to 500 quintillion (5  1020) bytes per day, almost 200 times more
than all the other sources combined in the world.
• The Square Kilometre Array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas.
It is expected to be operational by 2024. Collectively, these antennas are
expected to gather 14 exabytes and store one petabyte per day [37, 38]. It is
considered one of the most ambitious scientiﬁc projects ever undertaken [39].
• When the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) began to collect astronomical data
in 2000, it amassed more in its ﬁrst few weeks than all data collected in the
history of astronomy previously. Continuing at a rate of about 200 GB per night,
SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information [40]. When the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, successor to SDSS, comes online in 2020, its
designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every ﬁve days [5].
• Decoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process; now it can be
achieved in less than a day. The DNA sequencers have divided the sequencing
cost by 10,000 in the last ten years, which is 100 times cheaper than the
reduction in cost predicted by Moore’s Law [5].
• The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) stores 32 petabytes of climate
observations and simulations on the Discover supercomputing cluster [41, 42].
• Google’s DNAStack compiles and organizes DNA samples of genetic data from
around the world to identify diseases and other medical defects. These fast and

exact calculations eliminate any ‘friction points,’ or human errors that could be
made by one of the numerous science and biology experts working with the
DNA. DNAStack, a part of Google Genomics, allows scientists to use the vast
sample of resources from Google’s search server to scale social experiments that
would usually take years, instantly [43, 44].
• 23andme’s DNA database contains genetic information of over 1,000,000
people worldwide [45]. The company explores selling the “anonymous aggre-
gated genetic data” to other researchers and pharmaceutical companies for
research purposes if patients give their consent [46–50]. Ahmad Hariri, pro-
fessor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who has been using
23andMe in his research since 2009 states that the most important aspect of the
company’s new service is that it makes genetic research accessible and relatively
cheap for scientists [51]. A study that identiﬁed 15 genome sites linked to
depression in 23andMe’s database lead to a surge in demands to access the
repository with 23andMe ﬁelding nearly 20 requests to access the depression
data in the 2 weeks after publication of the paper [52].
• Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and hydrodynamic turbulence research
generate massive datasets. The Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB)
contains over 350 terabytes of spatiotemporal ﬁelds from Direct Numerical
simulations of various turbulent ﬂows. Such data have been difﬁcult to share
using traditional methods such as downloading ﬂat simulation output ﬁles. The
data within JHTDB can be accessed using “virtual sensors” with various access
modes ranging from direct web-browser queries, access through Matlab,
Python, Fortran and C programs executing on clients’ platforms, to cut out
services to download raw data. The data have been used in over 150 scientiﬁc
publications.
Technology
• eBay.com uses two data warehouses at 7.5 petabytes and 40 PB as well as a 40
PB Hadoop cluster for search, consumer recommendations, and merchandising
[53].
• Amazon.com handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as
queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. The core technology that
keeps Amazon running is Linux-based and as of 2005 they had the world’s three
largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB [54].
• Facebook handles 50 billion photos from its user base [55].
• Google was handling roughly 100 billion searches per month since August 2012
[56].
In March 2012, The White House announced a national “Big Data Initiative”
that consisted of six Federal departments and agencies committing more than $200
million to big data research projects [57].
xviii
Introduction

The initiative included a National Science Foundation “Expeditions in
Computing” grant of $10 million over 5 years to the AMPLab [58] at the University
of California, Berkeley [59]. The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA, and
over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of
problems from predicting trafﬁc congestion [60] to ﬁghting cancer [61].
The White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the
Department of Energy to provide $25 million in funding over 5 years to establish
the Scalable Data Management, Analysis and Visualization (SDAV) Institute [62],
led by the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories
and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize
data on the Department’s supercomputers.
The U.S. state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data
Initiative in May 2012, which provides funding from the state government and
private companies to a variety of research institutions [63]. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data
in the MIT Computer Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory, combining
government, corporate, and institutional funding and research efforts [64].
The European Commission is funding the 2-year-long Big Data Public Private
Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies, academics
and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues. The project aims to deﬁne a
strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the
European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy.
Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon 2020, their next
framework program [65].
Facing the challenges of BD the problems of development and implementation
of adequate methods, techniques and software of BD analysis (BD Mining) are
extremely important. It’s worth to notice that conventional methods and techniques
of Data Mining are not adequate for this goal.
The mankind have developed some fruitful approaches to deal with high
dimension and large volumes of data. One of them widely used is clustering.
Clustering enables to divide large data set into several groups of similar objects and
replace the whole group by one representative object—center of cluster. Up to date
many algorithms of cluster analysis were developed. But problem of clustering in
real-time mode arises when new data are entering as stream data and demands new
efﬁcient methods and algorithms.
Another approach of reducing volume of data set is hierarchy. Hierarchical
organization of data enables to structuring initial data set into several subordinate
levels which gives opportunity classify objects by feature set and easily ﬁnd the
searched object or small group of objects by its features.
Last years due to demand of speed processing, prediction and classiﬁcation of
huge volumes of data Deep learning networks were developed with large number of
neuron layers. With their appearance the new problem has arisen to develop efﬁ-
cient methods of learning such networks. Some novel approach to solution of fast
Introduction

Deep learning is the application of so-called Group Method of Data Handling which
represents very efﬁcient tools for reducing dimensionality.
The present book deals with some problems of BD analysis, considers and
investigates as conventional tools of Data Mining and novel efﬁcient methods and
tools as well developed for this goal.
In Chap. 1 methods of cluster analysis are considered. The crisp and fuzzy
clustering methods are described and analyzed. New efﬁcient possibilistic methods
of clustering including robust clustering methods working under high noise level
are considered. Special attention is played for development of new clustering
methods which operate under data streams in on-line mode. The examples of
application of clustering methods for some practical problems are presented.
Chapter 2 is devoted to analysis, training of Deep learning (DL) networks and
their applications to solution some BD tasks. At the beginning structure and con-
ventional training methods of DL are considered, the problem of vanishing gradient
while training is considered and several ways of its prevention are considered
(so-called methods of regularization).
The main attention in this chapter is played to development and presentation of
so-called Hybrid GMDH-neo-fuzzy networks for solution computation intelligence
task with BD. This new class of FNN turned to be efﬁcient tools to overcome high
dimensionality. In the chapter are presented several types of hybrid GMDH-FNNs
and their application to the solution of real problems of prediction, classiﬁcation
and control.
Chapter 3 deals with classiﬁcation problems. The FNN NefClass is considered as
efﬁcient tools of classiﬁcation under BD conditions. The structure, training algo-
rithms of FNN NefClass are presented and analyzed. The application of FNN
NefClass for solution of medical images analysis and recognition in the problems of
medical diagnostics are presented.
As it is known the new efﬁcient tools for images processing and recognition are
Convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN are applied to ﬁnd informative features
of image which are fed into multilayered perceptron for further classiﬁcation.
In the chapter new hybrid CNN-FNN system for image recognition is described
where CNN is used for ﬁnding features of image while FNN NEFClass is used for
further classiﬁcation. The investigations of the suggested hybrid network and
comparison with known CNN systems are performed at the practical problem of
recognition of breast cancer at the standard data set BreakHis.
Chapter 4 of the book is devoted to the intellectual analysis of large historical
data with the purpose of recognizing the laws of the origin and development of
global systemic conﬂicts and with the purpose of analyzing the causes leading to
these conﬂicts. The generalization and formalization of approaches to the recog-
nition of C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts through big historical data have been
carried out and general concept of description and interpretation of these waves has
been proposed. Based on intellectual analysis of big data on the conﬂicts, taking
place since 750 B.C. up to now, have been analyzed and their general pattern has
been revealed. These have been tried to foresee the next global conﬂict called the
conﬂict of the 21st century. Its nature and main characteristics have been analyzed.
xx
Introduction

The hypotheses for a metric relation between the global periodic processes, namely
between the sequence of 11-year cycles of solar activity, so called Kondratieff
cycles of the development of the global economy, and the process of evolutionary
structuration of the family of the C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts have been
formulated.
The problem of prediction of these processes in the 21st century by using a
metric approach was considered. The possible scenarios of the development of the
conﬂict of the 21st century have been constructed and analyzed. Ideas aimed to
avoiding of undesirable consequences for humanity in the case of full or partial
implementation of the predicted scenarios are proposed.
On the whole, this chapter represents the wonderful example of application and
development of general ideas and paradigms of Data Mining to detection of hidden
laws in evolution of world economy and global conﬂicts and their systemic
analysis.

The Cluster Analysis in Big Data Mining
1.1
Introduction
Methods of clustering represent a powerful tools for reducing dimensions of BD
warehouses. Clustering enables to split the initial big data set into several groups of
similar objects by features of similarity-difference using various distance metrics
and replace the whole group by the most representative object locating in the cluster
center. In this chapter different clustering methods and techniques are considered
and their applications for practical problems solutions are presented
Term cluster analysis (introduced by Tryon, 1939 for the ﬁrst time) actually
includes a set of various algorithms of classiﬁcation without teacher [1]. The
general question asked by researchers in many areas is how to organize observed
data in evident structures, i.e. to develop taxonomy.
The clustering is applied in the most various areas. For example, in the ﬁeld of
medicine the clustering of diseases, treatments of diseases or symptoms of diseases
leads to widely used taxonomy. In the ﬁeld of psychiatry the correct diagnostics of
clusters of symptoms, such as paranoia, schizophrenia, etc., is decisive for successful
therapy. In archeology by means of the cluster analysis researchers try to make tax-
onomy of stone tools, funeral objects, etc. Broad applications of the cluster analysis in
market researches are well known. Generally, every time when it is necessary to
classify “mountains” of information to groups, suitable for further processing, the
cluster analysis is very useful and effective. In recent years the cluster analysis is widely
used in the intellectual analysis of data (Data Mining), as one of the principal methods.
The purpose of this chapter is the consideration of modern methods of the cluster
analysis, crisp methods(a method of C-means, Ward’s method, the next neighbor,
the most distant neighbor), and fuzzy methods, robust probabilistic and possibilistic
clustering methods.
Numerous results of pilot studies of fuzzy methods of a cluster analysis are
presented in the Sect. 1.9 among them is a problem of UN countries clustering by
indicators of sustainable development.

Cluster Analysis, Problem Deﬁnition. Criteria
of Quality and Metrics
Let the set of observations c1 be given, where Xi ¼ fxijg; j ¼ 1; N. It is required to
divide a set X into not intersected K subsets—clusters S1; . . .; SK so that to provide
extremum of some criterion (functional of quality), that is:
to ﬁnd such S ¼ ðS1; . . .; SKÞ that f ðSÞ ! minðmaxÞ.
Different types of criteria (functional) of splitting are possible. It’s worth to note
that this task is closely connected with deﬁnition of some metrics in a feature space.
Consider the most widely used functionals of splitting quality [2]:

As initial information is set in the form of a matrix X, there is a metrics choice
problem. Metrics choice—the most important factor inﬂuencing results of a cluster
analysis. Depending on type of features various measures of distance (metrics) are
used.
Let be samples Xi and XK in N-dimensional feature space.
The main metrics of clustering are given in the Table 1.1.
There is a large number of clustering algorithms which use various metrics and
criteria of splitting.

1.3
Classiﬁcation of Algorithms of Cluster Analysis
When performing a clustering it is important to know, how many clusters contains
an initial sample It is supposed that the clustering has to reveal natural local
grouping of objects. Therefore the number of clusters is the parameter which is
often signiﬁcantly complicates an algorithm if it is supposed to be unknown and
signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing quality of result if it is known.
The problem of a choice of clusters number is very nontrivial. It is enough to tell
that for obtaining the satisfactory theoretical decision often it is required to make in
advance very strong assumptions of properties of some family of distributions. But
about what assumptions one can make when, especially at the beginning of
research, of data practically it isn’t known? Therefore algorithms of a clustering
usually are constructed as some way of search clusters number and determination of
its optimum value in the course of search.
The number of methods of splitting a set of objects into clusters is quite great.
All of them can be subdivided on hierarchical and not hierarchical.
In not hierarchical algorithms their work and conditions of stop need to be
regulated in advance often with large number of parameters that is sometimes
difﬁcult, especially at the initial stage of investigation. But in such algorithms big
ﬂexibility in a variation of a clustering is reached and usually the number of clusters
is deﬁned. In not hierarchical algorithms a criterion of clustering is given and it
should be optimized in result of splitting initial sample or set into clusters.
On the other hand, when objects are characterized by a large number of features
(parameters), a task of grouping features is important. Initial information contains in
a square matrix of features interconnections, in particular, in a correlation matrix.
Basis of the successful solution of a grouping task is the informal hypothesis of a
small number of the hidden factors which deﬁne structure of an interconnection
between features.
In hierarchical algorithms one actually refuses to deﬁne a number of clusters,
building a full tree of the enclosed clusters (so-called dendrogram). The number of
clusters is deﬁned from the assumptions, in principle, which aren’t relating to work
of algorithms, for example on dynamics of change of a threshold of splitting
(merge) of clusters. Difﬁculties of such algorithms are well studied: choice of
measures of proximity of clusters, problem of inversions of indexation in the
dendrograms, inﬂexibility of hierarchical classiﬁcations which is sometimes
undesirable. Nevertheless, representation of a clustering in the form of a dendro-
gram allows to gain the most complete display of structure of clusters.
Hierarchical algorithms are connected with dendrograms construction and
divided on:
1. agglomerative, characterized by consecutive merge of initial elements and the
corresponding reduction of number of clusters (creation of clusters from below
to top);
4

2. divisional (divided) in which the number of clusters increases, starting with one
cluster therefore the sequence of the splitting groups is constructed (creation of
clusters from top to down).
1.3.1
Hierarchical Algorithms. Agglomerative Algorithms
On the ﬁrst step all the set of objects is represented as a set of clusters:
c1 ¼ fi1g; c2 ¼ fi2g; . . .; cm ¼ fimg
On the following step two closest one to another clusters are chosen (for
example, cp and cq) and unite in one joint cluster. The new set consisting already of
m −1 of clusters will be such:
c1 ¼ fi1g; c2 ¼ fi2g; . . .; cp ¼ fip; iqg; . . .; cp ¼ fimg
Repeating process, we obtain step by step the consecutive sets consisting of (т −
2), (т −3), (т −4) and etc. clusters.
At the end of procedure the cluster consisting of m of objects and coinciding
with an initial set I will be obtained.
For determination of distance between clusters it is possible to choose different
metrics. Depending on it algorithms with various properties exist.
There are some methods of recalculation of distances with use of old values of
distances for the united clusters differing in coefﬁcients in a formula:
drs ¼ apdps þ aqdqs þ bdpq þ c dps  dqs


If clusters p and q unite in one cluster of r and it is required to calculate distance
from a new cluster to cluster say, s, application of this or that method depends on a
way of determination of distance between clusters, these methods differ with values
of coefﬁcients ap; aq; b; c.
Coefﬁcients of recalculation of distances between clusters ap; aq; b; c are spec-
iﬁed in Table 1.2.
1.3.2
Divisional Algorithms
Divisional cluster algorithms, unlike agglomerative, on the ﬁrst step represent all set
of elements I as the only cluster. On each step of algorithm one of the existing
clusters is recursively divided into two afﬁliated. Thus, clusters from top to down are
iteratively formed. This approach isn’t so in detail described in literature devoted to
1.3

the cluster analysis, as agglomerative algorithms. It is applied when it is necessary to
divide all set of objects on rather small amount clusters.
One of the ﬁrst the divisional algorithms was offered by Smith Maknaoton in
1965 [2].
All elements are located on the ﬁrst step in one cluster C1 ¼ I.
Then the element, at which average value of distance from other elements in this
cluster is the greatest is selected. Average value can be calculated, for example, by
means of a formula
DC1 ¼

The chosen element is removed from a cluster of C1 and becomes the ﬁrst
member of the second cluster C2.
On each subsequent step an element in a cluster of C1 for which the difference
between average distance to the elements which are in C2, and average distance to
the elements remaining in C1 is the greatest is transferred to C2.. Transfer of

elements from C1 in C2 proceed until the corresponding differences of averages
become negative, i.e. so far there are elements located to elements of a cluster of C2
closer than to cluster elements of C1.
As a result one cluster is divided into two afﬁliated ones which will be split at the
following level of hierarchy. Each subsequent level procedure of division is applied
to one of the clusters received at the previous level. The choice of cluster to be split
can be carried out differently.
In 1990 Kauffman and Rouzeuv suggested to choose at each level a cluster for
splitting with the greatest diameter which is calculated on a formula [2]
DC ¼ maxdðip; iqÞ8ip; iq 2 C
Recursive division of clusters proceeds, so far all clusters or won’t become
singleton (i.e. consisting of one object), or so far all members of one cluster won’t
have zero difference from each other.
1.3.3
Not Hierarchical Algorithms
The great popularity at the solution of clustering problems was acquired by the
algorithms based on search of splitting a data set into clusters (groups). In many
tasks algorithms of splitting are used owing to the advantages. These algorithms try
to group data (in clusters) so that criterion function of splitting algorithm reaches an
extremum (minimum). We’ll consider three main algorithms of a clustering based
on splitting methods. In these algorithms the following basic concepts are used:
• the training set (an input set of data) of M on which splitting is based;
• distance metrics:
d2
Aðmj; cðiÞÞ ¼
mj  cðiÞ
		
		2¼ ðmj  cðiÞÞtAðmj  cðiÞÞ
ð1:6Þ
where the matrix A deﬁnes a way of distance calculation. For example, for a
singular matrix distance according to Euclid metrics is used;
• vector of the centers of clusters C;
• splitting matrix on clusters U;
• goal function J ¼ JðM; d; C; UÞ;
• set of restrictions.
Description of K-means Algorithm
Basic deﬁnitions and concepts within this algorithm are following:
• the training set M ¼ fmjgd

• the distance metrics counted by a formula (1.6);
• vector of the centers of clusters C ¼ fcðiÞgc

which deﬁnes that each vector of data can belong only to one cluster and doesn’t
belong to the rest. Each cluster contains not less than one point, but less than a
total number of points.
Structurally the algorithm represents the following iterative procedure [1].
Step 1. To initialize initial splitting (for example, in a random way), to choose
accuracy value d (it is used in a condition of end of an algorithm), to initialize a
number of iteration l = 0.
Step 2. To deﬁne the centers of clusters by the following formula:

process if it isn’t true then pass to a step 2 with number of iteration l ¼ l þ 1. The
main shortcoming inherent to this algorithm owing to discrete character of elements
of a splitting matrix is the big size of splitting space. One way to overcome this
shortcoming is the choice of elements of a splitting matrix by numbers from a unit

interval. That is, belonging of a data element to a cluster has to be deﬁned by
membership function—the element of data can belong to several clusters with
various degree of membership. In that case we come to a problem of fuzzy clus-
tering. This approach found the embodiment in algorithm of fuzzy clustering—
fuzzy method of K-means (Fuzzy C-Means).
1.4
Fuzzy C-Means Method
Consider a neural network with self-organization where training is performed without
a teacher. The algorithm of self-organization relates a vector x to the corresponding
cluster of data which is presented by its center, using a competitive training.
The basic form of algorithm of self-organization allows to ﬁnd precisely position
of the centers of the relevant groups (clusters) into which the output multidimen-
sional space is split. These centers can be used further in hybrid algorithm of
training of FNNs as initial values that considerably accelerates process of training
and guarantees convergence to a global minimum [3].
1.4.1
Algorithm of Fuzzy C-Means
Let’s assume that in a network exists m fuzzy neurons with the centers in points
cj; ðj ¼ 1; 2; . . .; mÞ. Initial values of these centers can be chosen randomly from
areas of admissible values of the corresponding components of vectors xk; ðk ¼
1; 2; . . .; NÞ used for training. Let function of a fuzziﬁcation be set in the form of the
generalized Gauss function expressed by a formula (1.8).
The vector entered in a network input xk will belong to various groups repre-
sented by the centers cj, with degree wkj, and 0\wkj\1, and total degree of
membership to all groups, is obviously, equal 1. Therefore
X

wkj ¼ 1;
ð1:13Þ
for all wkjðk ¼ 1; 2; . . .; NÞ.
The function of an error corresponding to such representation can be deﬁned as
the sum of individual errors of membership to the centers ci taking into account
fuzziness degree b. Therefore, [4]

where b is a weight coefﬁcient which accepts values from an interval ð1; 1Þ. The
training goal of self-organization consists in such selection of the centers cj, that for
the whole set of the training vectors xk—achievement of a minimum of function
(1.14) at simultaneous fulﬁllment of conditions (1.13) is attained. Thus it is a
problem of minimization of nonlinear function (1.14) with N constraints of type
(1.13). The solution of this task can be transferred to minimization of Lagrange
function deﬁned by the form [4].

where dkj—is Euclidean distance between the center cj and vector xk, dkj ¼

		.
As exact values of the centers cj at the beginning of process aren’t known, the training
algorithm has to be iterative. It can be formulated in the following way:
1. To execute random initialization of coefﬁcients wkj, choosing their values from
an interval [0, 1] so that the condition (1.13) be satisﬁed.
2. To deﬁne К centers cj, in accordance with (1.16).
3. To calculate value of the error function according to expression (1.14). If its
value appears below the established threshold or if reduction of this error of
previous iteration is negligible, to ﬁnish calculations. The last values of the
centers represent the required decision. Otherwise, go to step 4
4. To calculate new values ukj in a formula (1.17) and to pass to step 2.
Such procedure is called the fuzzy self-organization algorithm C-means.
Repetition of iterative procedure leads to achievement of a minimum of function
E which won’t be a global minimum. The quality of the found centers estimated by
value of an error function E essentially depends on preliminary selection of values
wkj and centers cj. As the best will be such placement of the centers at which they
settle down in the areas containing the greatest number of the shown vectors xj. At
such selection of the centers they will represent vectors of data xj with the smallest
total error.
Therefore the beginning of iterative procedure of calculation of optimum values
of the centers has to be preceded by procedure of their initialization. Algorithms of
10

peak and differential grouping of data belong to the most known algorithms of
initialization.
1.4.2
Deﬁnition of Initial Location of the Centers
of Clusters
Algorithm of Peak Grouping
The algorithm of peak grouping was offered by Jager and Filev [4, 5].
When using N input vectors the special grid which evenly covers space of these
vectors is constructed. Nodes of this grid are considered as potential centers #, for
each of which peak function is calculated:
mð#Þ ¼
X
N
k¼1
exp
 #  xk
k
k2b
2r2
(
)
ð1:18Þ
where r is some constant which is selected separately for each speciﬁc task.
Value mð#Þ is considered as an assessment of height of peak function. It is
proportional to quantity of vectors xj, which get to the vicinity of the potential
center #. Great value mð#Þ testiﬁes to that the center # locates in the area in which
the greatest number of vectors is concentrated fxkg.
The coefﬁcient of r inﬂuences ﬁnal proportions between mð#Þ and # slightly.
After calculation of values mð#Þ for all potential centers the ﬁrst center is
selected c1, which has the greatest value mð#Þ. For a choice of the following centers
it is necessary to exclude c1 and nodes which are placed in close proximity to c1.
It can be done by redeﬁnition of peak function at the expense of separation of
Gauss function from it with the center in a point c1. Having designated this new
function through mnewð#Þ, we receive:
mnewð#Þ ¼ mð#Þ  mðc1Þ exp
 #  c1
k
k2b
2r2
(
)
ð1:19Þ
Note that this function has zero in a point c1.
Then the same procedure repeats value with the next center c2, etc.
Process of ﬁnding of the following centers c2, c3 is realized consistently on the
modiﬁed values mnewð#Þ, which turn out at an exception of the next neighbors of
the center which was found at the previous stage. It comes to an end at the moment
of localization of all the centers.
The method of peak grouping is effective at not really big dimension of a vector
of X. Otherwise number of the potential centers increases as avalanche.
Algorithm of Differential Grouping
The algorithm of differential grouping is a modiﬁcation of the previous algorithm,
in which vectors xj are considered as the potential centers #. Peak function DðxiÞ in
this case takes the form [5]:

ð1:20Þ
where value of coefﬁcient ra deﬁnes the sphere of the neighborhood. On value
DðxiÞ considerably inﬂuence only vectors xj, which are inside this sphere.
At the big density of points near xi function value DðxiÞ is large. After calcu-
lation of values of peak function for each point xi, the vector x is found, for which
density measure DðxÞ will appear to be the greatest. This point becomes the ﬁrst
center c1.
Choice of the following center c2 is performed after an exception of the previous
center and all points which lie in its vicinity.
As well as in the previous case peak function is redeﬁned so

At new deﬁnition of function D coefﬁcients rb designate new values of a constant
which sets the sphere of the neighborhood of the following center. Usually a
condition rb  ra is used.
After modiﬁcation of value of peak function a search of a new point x, for which
DnewðxiÞ ! max is performed It becomes the new center.
Process of ﬁnding of the next center is resumed after the exception of all already
selected points. Initialization comes to an end at the time of ﬁxing of all centers
which are provided by entry conditions.
1.5
Gustavson-Kessel’s Fuzzy Cluster Analysis Algorithm
In classical algorithm fuzzy C = means elements of error function E are obtained by
means of usual Euclid distance between a vector x and the center of a cluster c with:
dðx; cÞ ¼ x  c

k ¼

ðx  cÞTðx  cÞ

At such metrics of distance between two vectors the set of the points equidistant
from the center represents a sphere with an identical scale on all axes. But if data form
groups which form differs from spherical or if scales of separate coordinates of a
vector strongly differ, such metrics becomes inadequate. In this case quality of a
clustering can be increased considerably at the expense of the improved version of the
self-organization algorithm which is called as Gustavson-Kessel’s algorithm [3, 4].
The main changes of basic algorithm fuzzy C-means consist in introduction to a
metrics calculation formula of the scaling matrix A. At such scaling the distance
between the center c and vectors x is deﬁned by a formula:

As scaling usually the positive-deﬁnite matrix is used, that is a matrix, at which

Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm
Major drawbacks associated with a probabilistic approach (Fuzzy C-means algo-
rithm)are connected with constraints (1.13). In the simplest case of two clusters
ðm ¼ 2Þ is easy to see that the observation xk, equally owned by both clusters and
observation xp, not belonging to any of them, may have the same levels of mem-
bership wðk;1Þ ¼ wðk;2Þ ¼ wðp;1Þ ¼ wðp;2Þ ¼ 0:5.
Naturally, this fact decreasing the accuracy of classiﬁcation, led to a possibilistic
approach to the fuzzy classiﬁcation [5]. In the possibilistic clustering algorithm
goal function has the form
Eðwk;j; cjÞ ¼

ð1:27Þ
where scalar parameter lj [ 0 determines the distance on which membership level
takes the value 0.5, that is if d2ðxk; cjÞ ¼ lj, then wk;j ¼ 0:5.
Minimization (1.27) by wk;j, cj, lj gives evident solution

It can be seen that the possibilistic and probabilistic algorithms are very similar
and pass one into other by replacing the expression (1.27) to the formula (1.15), and
vice versa. A common disadvantage of the considered algorithms is their compu-
tational complexity and the inability to work in real time. The algorithm (1.15)–
(1.17) begins with the initial task (normal random) partitions matrix W0. On the
basis of its values initial set of prototypes c0
j is calculated which then is used to
calculate a new matrix W1. Then this procedure is continued and sequence of
solutions c1
j W2; . . .; Wt; ct
jWt þ 1 etc. is obtained until the difference
Wt þ 1  Wt
		
		
is less than a preassigned threshold e.
Therefore, all available data sample is processed repeatedly.
The solution obtained using a probabilistic algorithm, is recommended as the
initial conditions for possibilistic algorithm (1.28)–(1.30) [5]. Parameter distance lj
is initialized in accordance with (1.30) on the results of the probabilistic algorithm.

Robust Adaptive Algorithms of Probabilistic Fuzzy
Clustering
The considered above clustering methods can effectively solve the problem of
classiﬁcation with a substantial intersection of the clusters, however, it assumes that
the data within each cluster are located compactly enough without sharp (abnormal)
outliers.
However, it should be noted that the actual data is usually distorted by outliers,
the share of which according to some estimates [7], is up to 20% so that to speak of
a compact placement of data is not always correct.
In this regard, recently, much attention was paid to problems of fuzzy cluster
analysis of the data, the density distribution of which differs from the normal by
presence of “heavy tails” [8, 9].
Robust Recursive Algorithm for Probabilistic Fuzzy Clustering
After standardization of feature vectors components so that all source vectors would
belong to the unit hypercube ½0; 1n, the objective function is constructed

ð1:45Þ
where xk;i; cj;i are the i-th components of ðn  1Þ—vectors xk; cj correspondingly.
Estimates relating to the quadratic objective functions are optimal when the data
belong to the class of distributions with ﬁnite variance, the most famous member of
which is a Gaussian.
Varying parameter p allows to improve the properties of the robustness of
clustering procedures, however, the quality of assessment is determined by the type
of data distribution. Thus, the estimates with p = 1 are optimal for the Laplacian
data distribution, but their construction involves great computational expense. Quite
realistic is the class of approximate normal distributions [9].
Approximately normal distributions are mixture of Gaussian density and dis-
tribution of some arbitrary density, which distorts with outliers the normal distri-
bution. The optimal objective function in this case is the quadratic-linear, and tends
to linear type as the distance from the minimum grows.
The most prominent representative of the approximate normal distribution
density function is
pðxi; ciÞ ¼ Seðci; siÞ ¼ 1
2si
sec h2 xi  ci
si
;
ð1:46Þ
where ci, si are parameters, determining a center and a width of the distribution.
This function resembles a Gaussian in the vicinity of the center, however, has a
more heavy tails. With the distribution (1.46) is associated an objective function
fiðxi; ciÞ ¼ bi ln cosh xi  ci
bi
;
ð1:47Þ
where the parameter bi deﬁnes steepness of this function, while in the vicinity of the
minimum this function is very close to the quadratic, tending with the growth of
X to a linear one.
Also interesting is the fact that the derivative of this function
f 0

is a standard activation function of artiﬁcial neural networks. Using as a metric the

Robust Recursive Algorithm of Possibilistic Fuzzy

where the distance parameter lkj may be determined according to the second
equation of the system (1.59) for k observations rather than the entire sample
volume N.
It should be noted that the last equation of system (1.52) and (1.58) are identical
and are determined only by choice of metrics. This makes possible to use any
suitable metric for a particular case, which will determine only the setup procedure
of prototypes if the equation for calculating the weights still remains the same.
Considered robust recursive methods may be used in a batch mode and in the
on-line mode as well. In the last case the number of observation k represents a
discrete time.
Experiments with a repository of data, distorted by abnormal outliers (emis-
sions), have shown high efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms in the processing of
the information given in the form of tables “object-property” [7, 8] and in the form
of time series [10].
In particular, the problem of data classiﬁcation of specially artiﬁcially generated
sample containing three-dimensional cluster of data was considered, whose
observations are marked the symbols “o”, “x” and “+” [9] (see Fig. 1.1). Points in
each cluster are distributed according to the density of Laplace distribution having
“heavy tails”
pðxiÞ ¼ rð1 þ ðxi  cÞ2Þ1
ð1:63Þ
where r and c are width and center correspondingly.
The sample includes 9000 observations (3000 in each cluster) and is divided into
training (7200 cases) and testing (1800 cases) subsamples [10, 11].
It should be noted that some observations are very far away from the centers of
the clusters (Fig. 1.1a). Prototypes of the clusters are located in the central region of
the data as shown in Fig. 1.1b. In order to ﬁnd the correct prototypes clustering
algorithm should be insensitive to outliers.
For all of the algorithms involved in the comparison, the procedure of the
experiment was performed as follows. At the beginning of training a sample was
clustered by appropriate algorithms and prototypes of clusters have been found.
20

The Cluster Analysis in Big Data Mining

Then, training and testing samples were classiﬁed according to the results of
clustering. Observations belonging to each cluster in the classiﬁcation process are
calculated in accordance with Eqs. (1.17), (1.56) or (1.62) depending on the type of
clustering algorithm. The cluster, to which the observation belongs with a maxi-
mum membership degree, deﬁnes the class of this observation. Classiﬁcation and
training is performed in the on-line mode of receiving observations, where
b ¼ 2; b1 ¼ b2 ¼ b3 ¼ 1; gðkÞ ¼ 0:01. The results are shown in Table 1.3 [9].

Robust Recursive Algorithm of Possibilistic Fuzzy Clustering for Big Data

In the Fig. 1.2 it can be easily seen that the centers of the clusters (prototypes)
produced by the algorithm «fuzzy C-means» by Bezdek, are shifted from the visual
centers of the clusters, due to the presence of “heavy tails” of the data distribution
density, in contrast to the robust methods with objective function (1.56) and (1.62)
in which prototypes are found more precisely, which is conﬁrmed by the less
classiﬁcation error (see Table 1.3).
Continuous growth in the successful application of computational intelligence
technologies in the areas of data analysis conﬁrms the versatility of this approach.
At the same time, real problems that arise in the processing of very large databases
(Big Data), complicate the use of existing algorithms and tools and demand to be
improved to meet the challenges of data mining in real time using the paradigms of
CI and soft computing.

In this experiment it was required to perform a clustering of the United Nations
countries into 4 clusters by the above indicators. As a result of the clustering
algorithm of Gustavson–Kessel application the following results were obtained
centers of clusters are presented in Table 1.5.
The matrix of belonging coefﬁcients to different clusters (membership functions)
are presented in Table 1.6.
As can be seen from the table in the ﬁrst cluster are countries with relatively high
rates of all indicators (compared to other countries in the sample). These are the

countries of CIS, Eastern and western Europe, USA, Canada, the Balkans and Latin
America countries.
In the second cluster are countries with smaller values of indicators, it’s coun-
tries of North Africa and Middle East. In this cluster, is the lowest level of gender
equality.
In the third cluster are the poorest countries with the lowest levels of literacy, as
well as the low level of gender equality. Mainly it’s African countries.
In the fourth cluster are poor countries with the most unfavorable conditions for
the growth of children.
Example 1.2 Classiﬁcation of the United Nations countries on sustainable devel-
opment indicators.
Investigations of fuzzy clustering method C-means by indicators of sustainable
development for the countries of the United Nations were carried out. For this, the
data of the World Data Center in Ukraine (WDC) were used.
As sustainable development indicators the following indices were taken:
• Index GINI—GINI
• Ihd—index of health status
• Iql—standard of living index
• Isd—index of sustainable development.
As algorithm of initial centers placement the algorithm of differential grouping
was applied. Clustering was carried out for a different number of clusters K = 3, 4,
5. Besides the value of optimized criterion the quality of splitting will be evaluated
by the indicator of Hi-Beni:
v ¼ dav
Dav
;
where dav is the average intra-cluster distance, Dav—average inter-cluster distance.
This indicator should be minimized.
Experiment 1. K = 3 (Tables 1.7 and 1.8)
Let us analyze the results. The ﬁrst cluster contains countries with the highest
values of all parameters. These are the countries of Western Europe, as well as
some other. Namely, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Great Britain, Hungary,
Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg,

Experiment 2. K = 4 (Table 1.9)
It is interesting to analyse dynamics of changes of clusters after transition from
K = 3 to K = 4.
The countries with the greatest values of all indicators fall to the ﬁrst cluster. The
structure of this cluster practically didn’t change. In the second cluster there are
countries with the minimum value of an index GINI and average values of all other
indicators. Here are the countries of Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Panama,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, etc.
The countries with the minimum values of all indicators except GINI index fall to
the third cluster. Here the countries from the second cluster of the previous clustering
at K = 3 fall. Namely, Bangladesh, Benin, Zambia, Zimbabwe, India, Cambodia,
Cameroon, Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Tadzhikistan, Tanzania,
Uzbekistan.
The countries with average values of all indicators fall to the fourth cluster. Here

Consider the dependence of the index Hi-Beni on the number of clusters K
(Fig. 1.3)
As the chart above shows, the value of Hi-Beni index signiﬁcantly decreases
when K = 2–4, then its value is changing slightly. Therefore, the optimal number
of clusters lies in vicinity of K = 4.

should be given a priori. But usually it’s unknown for experts and the criteria of
clustering quality such as Hi-Beni indicator and Dunn’s Index (DI) are mono-
tonously decrease with number of clusters K. Therefore they can’t be used directly
for determining optimal value of Kopt.
For determining the proper number of clusters in practice may be used the following
approach. Assume the criterion of clustering be E ¼ Pm

Solve the clustering problem with criterion E with different k and ﬁnd E*(k).

Usually value d may be chosen as follows d 2 [0.1–0.2].

Conclusions
Cluster analysis includes a set of different classiﬁcation algorithms. In general,
whenever it is necessary to classify the “mountains” of information to suitable for
further processing groups, cluster analysis is very useful and effective. Cluster
analysis is needed for the classiﬁcation of information, it can be used in a certain
way to structure the variables and to ﬁnd out which variables should be combined in
the ﬁrst place, and which should be considered separately.
A great advantage of the cluster analysis is that it allows to split the objects not
only by one parameter but by a set of attributes as well. In addition, cluster analysis
unlike most mathematical and statistical methods do not impose any restrictions on
the form of these objects, and allows to treat a variety of raw data of almost
arbitrary nature. This is important, for example, in the situation when indicators are
diverse views, and it’s impossible to use traditional econometric approaches.

Application of Fuzzy Clustering Methods …

As any other method, cluster analysis has certain disadvantages and limitations:
in particular, the content and the number of clusters depend on the criteria selected
for partition. For the reduction of the original data set to a more compact form there
may be some distortion, and characteristics of individual objects may be lost by
replacing them with the characteristics of parameters of the cluster center.
The main disadvantage of the considered methods of fuzzy clustering C-means
and Gustavson-Kessel is that they can only be used when the number of clusters K
is known. But usually, the number of clusters is unknown, and visual observations
in the multidimensional case simply don’t lead to a success.

Introduction
One of the modern and efﬁcient tools for big data analytics are deep networks [1–4].
At present time theory and practice of machine learning live over real “deep rev-
olution” inspired by successful application of deep learning networks which rep-
resent the third generation of neural networks. In difference from classic neuron
networks (second generation) 80–90 years of 20-th century new training paradigms
allowed to get rid of some problems which hindered successful application of
traditional neural networks. Neural networks trained with deep learning algorithms
not only overcame by accuracy best alternative approaches but in some cases
displayed understanding of sense of input information (in image recognition, text
analysis and other problems).
The most successful industrial systems of computer vision and speech recognition
are built on deep networks and giants of IT-industry such as Apple, Google,
Facebook created large research teams dealing with deep learning. Term “deep
network” means big neural network with many hidden layers of neurons [1, 2]. Deep
learning represents a set of methods and techniques for training complex neural
networks (NN) with many layers. For such networks traditional machine learning
algorithms developed for conventional NN had become inadequate due to some
drawbacks in particular problem of decay and explosion of gradient in back propa-
gation algorithm [3, 4]. Therefore large dimensions of modern neural networks with
applications for 3-D images recognition and automatic speech recognition demanded
development of new efﬁcient training methods called deep learning.
But the most serious drawback of deep learning networks is a problem of
determination of its proper structure, how to choose adequate number of their
layers.
To the present time the problem of choice of number of DN layers is based on
knowledge and experience of an expert and refers to the art. The adequate solution
to this problem is connected with new class of hybrid neural networks—so-called

GMDH-neo-fuzzy networks representing a combination of self-organization
method GMDH and fuzzy neural networks. Due to principle of self-organization
and small number of tuning parameters GMDH enables to simplify and accelerate
the training of DN. In this chapter in the Sects. 2.8–2.10 several variants of this
class hybrid networks are considered and algorithms of their structure synthesis
based on GMDH are suggested and analyzed. Training algorithms for hybrid deep
networks are free from problem of gradient vanishing or explosion and besides the
application of GMDH enables to reduce dimensionality of training DN and
accelerate the convergence of training DN and by this solve some problems of BD.

Autoassociators. Autoencoders
Implementation of deep learning has led to development of the special learning
structure based on application of so-called autoassociators [3].
The main task of autoassociator is to obtain at the output the most accurate
mapping of the input vector (pattern).
The ﬁrst autoassociator (AA) was neo-cognitron suggested by Fukushima. Its
schema is presented in Fig. 2.1.
There are exist two types of AA: generating and synthesizing ones.
As the ﬁrst type are used restricted Boltzmann Machine, (RBM), as the second
type—autoencoders (AE) are used.

Autoencoder
One of the ﬁrst deep learning algorithms is auto-encoder. It’s an algorithm of
non-supervised learning whose output vector equals to input vector [5]. One of the
most spread auto-encoder architectures is feedforward neural network containing
input, hidden and output layers.
Unlike perceptron output autoencoder layer has the same number of neurons as
the input layer. The data at the input layer are compressed and restored so the
hidden features are retrieved.
The goal of autoencoder is to attain that NN output to be maximal close to input
vector. That to make non-trivial solution of this problem the special constraints are
set on network topology:
(1) the number neurons of hidden layer should be less than the number of input
neurons;
(2) the number of non-active neurons in hidden layer should signiﬁcantly exceed
the number of active neurons.
The ﬁrst constraint enable to compress data while transfer input signal to net-
work output. Such compression is possible if there are hidden interconnections in
data, correlation among features. The second constraint—demand of great number
of non-active neurons allows to obtain non-trivial results even when the number of
neurons in hidden layer excesses the dimensionality of input data/ In other words
the goal of autoencoder is to obtain the most signiﬁcant features.
Let consider a neuron be active if its activation is close to one, and non-active its
activation is close to zero. These constraints force autoencoder to search correla-
tions and generalization in input data and perform its compression.
By this the network automatically learns to extract in input data general features
which are encoded in network weights. Its necessary that mean value of transfer
function of each hidden neuron to get the value maximal close to a given sparsity
parameter about s = 0.05 for this in each neuron of hidden layer was introduced

The example of encoder is presented in Fig. 2.2. Autoencoder tends to build
function h(x) = x. In other words it tends to ﬁnd such approximation of this
function that the neural network output be equal to input vector. That to make the
solution of this problem non-trivial the number of hidden layer neurons should be
less than the dimensionality of input data (see Fig. 2.2).
This allow to obtain data compressing by transfer of input signal to output. For
example, if input vector presents a set of brightness levels of an image 10  10
pixels (all in all 100 features), the number of hidden later neurons is 50, the network
is forced to learn to compress an image.
Really, the demand h(x) = x means that on the base of activation levels of 50
neurons the output layer should restore 100 pixels of initial image. Such com-
pression is possible if there is hidden interconnections, correlation in features, and
in general a certain structure in data. In this way functions of autoencoder very
resembles Principal Components Algorithm (PCA) in the sense of cutting dimen-
sionality of input data.

Later as sparsity idea has been stated so-called the sparse Autoencoder appeared and
got wide application [5, 6]. Sparse autoencoder is an autoencoder with number of
hidden neurons much greater than the dimensionality of input vector. Sparse activation
means that the number of non-active neurons in the hidden layer exceeds signiﬁcantly
the number of active ones. If describe sparsity informal then a neuron is considered
active if its transfer function is about 1. If the sigmoidal transfer function is used then
for non-active neuron its value should be close to 0 (for tanh—close to −1).
There is a variant of autoencoder called denoising autoencoder [5]. It’s the same
autoencoder but its training is speciﬁc. While training randomly distorted data
(several input values are changed to 0) is fed into input. By this for comparison with
output are shown non-distorted values. In this way autoencoder is compelled to
restore distorted input data (Fig. 2.3).
Artiﬁcial feed-forward neural networks (ANN) with large number of layers are
badly trained by conventional methods which are good for ANN with small number
of hidden layers due to the problem of decaying gradient [4], the farther is layer
from output the less are the values of gradient norm.
This problem may be solved by correctly chosen initial weights. In this case it
doesn’t need to change them signiﬁcantly during the training process.

Energetic Models
Boltzmann machines represent a special form of log-linear Markov’s ﬁeld (MRF),
i.e. its energy function is linear by parameters. Therefore let’s consider ﬁrst
energy-based models (EBM). EBM connect scalar energy with each conﬁguration
of variables. The training corresponds to modiﬁcation of energy function so that its
form obtain the desired properties. For example, we would like that the desired
conﬁgurations have low energy. Probabilistic models energy-based determine the
probability distribution so:

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
The history of developing RBM begun from recurrent neural (RNN). Representing
the networks with backfeed which are difﬁcult to train. Therefore scientists started to
invent more restricted recurrent models for which more simple training algorithms
may be applied. One of such models was Hopﬁeld network, Hopﬁeld introduced also
energy concept after comparing neurodynamics with thermodynamics.
The next step was usual Boltzmann machines which differ from Hopﬁeld net-
work by stochastic nature and its neurons are divided into two groups: which
describe hidden and visible states.
The restricted Boltzmann machines differs from usual one that there are no
connections among neurons of the same layer (similar to hidden Markov models).
In Fig. 2.4 the structure of RBM is presented.
The property of this model is that at given state of one group of neurons the
states of another group of neurons would be independent each of other. Now
consider some theoretical results wherein this property plays a key role.
RBM interpretation. RBM are interpreted like hidden Markov models. They
have a layer of states which we can observe (visible neurons) and a layer of states

which are hidden and we can’t see them (hidden neuron). But we can make
probabilistic inference concerning hidden states basing on visible ones. After
training such model we also get opportunity to make conclusions about visible
states knowing hidden ones (using Bayes theorem) and by this generate data from
that probabilistic distribution on which model was trained.
Therefore we can formulate RBM training goal: it’s necessary to tune model
parameters so that restored vector would be maximal close to original.
By restored vector we imply vector obtained by probabilistic inference from
visible states.
RBM Algorithm
Often we are not interested to observe completely the instance X or we want to
introduce some not-observed variables that to increase the model descriptive force.
So let consider visible part of model (denote by X) and invisible part denoted as h.

Training Algorithm Contrastive Divergence (CD-k)
This algorithm was developed by professor Hinton in 2002, and it differs by
simplicity. The main idea lies in that the mathematical expectation are replaced by
certain values The concept of sampling is introduced (Gibbs sampling).
Algorithm CD-k runs as follows:
1. States of visible neurons are set equal to input pattern;
2. The probabilities of hidden layer neurons are calculated;
3. Each neuron of hidden layer the state “1” is assigned with probability equal to
its current state;
4. The probabilities of states of visible layer are determined basing at the states of
hidden layer;
5. If number of current iteration is less than k, return to step 2;
6. The probabilities neuron states of hidden layer are obtained

2.6
Deep Networks Learning
Process of learning deep networks is split in two stages [5–7]:
1. Pretraining;
2. Weights ﬁne-tuning.
2.6.1
Deep Network Pretraining
At the ﬁrst stage auto-associative network (SAE или SRBM) is non-supervised
trained at an array of not-marked data after that neurons of MLP hidden layer are
initialized with weights obtained after training. In Fig. 2.9 this process of training
and transfer is shown. After training of the ﬁrst AE/RBM weights of hidden layer
neurons become inputs of the second layer and so on. By this more and more general
information about structure of data (line, contour etc.) is retrieved out of data.
Let’s consider the pretraining procedure more detail. Pretraining represents the
following procedure: we take pairs of neighbor layers of deep learning network
beginning from the ﬁrst layer and construct from this pair autoencoder, by adding
output layer identical to input one. This procedure is repeated sequentially for all
network layers. This procedure may be described as follows.
1. Load a training data set X0;
2. Determine a network parameters—a number (N) and size of layers;
3. Set the number of current layer i = 0;
4. Build autoencoder for layers i, i + 1;
5. Train autoencoder at the set Xi;
6. Take away auxiliary (output) layer of autoencoder;
7. Preserve connection weights of layers i, i + 1;
8. If there are still pair of layers to be processed (i < N −2), then go to the next
step, otherwise go to step 10.
9. Generate data set Xi+1 for next autoencoder for this propagate through pair of
layers i, i + 1 data set Xi, and go to step 3;
10. End of work.
After this procedure the network is trained as a whole by one of the gradient
methods.
Besides, for deep networks with number of hidden layers more than three D.
Hinton suggested to perform ﬁne tuning also in two stages. At the ﬁrst stage train
only two upper layers and only after than to train the whole network. It worth to
note that with non-supervised learning SRBM gives less stable results than SAE.

2.6.2
Fine-Tuning
At the second stage ﬁne-tuning of MLP weights (training with teacher) is performed
by known methods. It was proved practically that such initialization set weights of
neurons of MLP hidden layers in the region of global minimum and next
ﬁne-tuning is performed for very short time. Fine-tuning is a process of weights
small changes for improving or optimization of results. As a rule it is aimed to
increase process efﬁciency. Fine-tuning may be executed by a number of methods
which are dependent on optimized processes which include gradient methods of
ﬁrst order, gradient methods of second order: Newton and quasi-Newton methods
and other.
2.7
Deep Learning Regularization
In problem of neural networks training exists two types of errors: (1) so-called
training error etr and generalization error egen. Training error is the error at the
training sample while generalization error is error at test sample. These two errors
are functions of the number of training iterations n and display different behavior:
etr monotonous decrease with n, while generalization error egen ﬁrst decrease then
attains minimum and then begins to rise with increase of n (this phenomenon is
called overﬁtting). The goal of training lies in minimization of generalization error.
Regularization is any modiﬁcation of training algorithm aimed to decrease
generalization error at the expense of certain increase of training error.
Regularization refers to one of the central problems in machine learning competing
by its signiﬁcance with problem of optimization.
Due to the theorem of costless breakfast the best algorithm of machine training
doesn’t exists in particularly, there is no the best method of regularization.
Instead we need choose the regularization form which ﬁts well to our problem to
be solved. Philosophy of deep learning in a whole lies therein wide range of
problems (such as all the intelligent problems) can be efﬁciently solved with
application of general forms (methods) of regularization. Consider the most popular
regularization methods and their models.

Consider optimal solution of problem (2.23), (2.24) under different p. It’s can be
shown that in case of p  1 optimal solution has sparsity property, i.e. a portion of
weights are exactly equal to zero. In case p > 1 strictly zero weights in optimal
solution are practically impossible. Note that situation p = 1 is distinguished, as in
this case optimized functional (2.25) is convex and optimal solution is sparse.

2.7.3
Dropout
The main idea of Dropout is instead of training one DNN to train an ensemble of
several DNN and then to average the obtained results [3, 4].
Networks for training are obtained by excluding from a network (dropping out)
neurons with probability p, so that the probability that neuron will remain in the
network is equal q = 1 −p. “Dropout” of a neuron means that under any input data
it return value 0.
Excluded neurons don’t contribute in training process at all stages of algorithm
backpropagation; therefore dropout even one neuron is equivalent to training new
neural network.
The probabilities of dropout each of neurons are equal. It means the following.
Using conditions, that:

As at the training stage a neuron remains switched on with probability q, at the

multiply activation function at the proper coefﬁcient not at the test stage but at the

neuron remains in a network switched on:

used more often.
2.7.4
Bagging (Ensemble Method)
One of ways to get ensemble of networks is application training by different
training samples which are obtained as a result of random process so called bag-
ging. Bagging (short for bootstrap aggregating)—is a method of decrease of gen-
eralization error by aggregating several models [4]. The idea lies in that to train
several different models separately and then all models vote at output at test sample.
This is an example of general strategy of machine learning called averaging model.
Methods using this strategy are known as ensemble methods. The cause to use
averaging lies that usually different models make different errors in test sample.
Consider for instance a set of k regression models. Assume that each model make
error i for each pattern i obtained from multivariate normal distribution with
variances E 2

Then the averaged prediction error made by whole ensemble is equal я −1

In the case when all errors completely correlated and c = v, MSE is equal to v,
therefore the averaging of models doesn’t help at all. But in case when errors of
different models are non-correlated c = 0, MSE of ensemble is equal 1
k v:
This means that MSE of ensemble linearly decreases with the size of ensemble.
In other words in average the ensemble will behave at least not worse as any of its
members and if all members make independent errors the ensemble will behave
much better than its members.

Cascade Neo-fuzzy Neural Networks Structure
Synthesis and Learning with Application of GMDH
Introduction
Last years the problem of stock prices and market indexes forecasting is of great
importance. For its solution various approaches were applied. The most prospective
methods of forecasting at markets are neural networks, especially fuzzy neural

networks and the GMDH. Earlier it was proved that neural networks are universal
approximators [4] and have some remarkable properties, such as parallel processing
of information, ability to work with incomplete noisy input data, and learning
possibilities to achieve the desired response (output).
The GMDH, from the other side, uses the principle of self-organization that
allows to construct an optimal structure of the forecasting model during the algo-
rithm operation [8–12]. It’s very promising to combine advantages of these both
approaches for the solution of the problem—constructing an efﬁcient model for the
ﬁnancial markets forecasting under BD conditions.
In the following presentation synthesis algorithm of the Neo-Fuzzy deep net-
work using the GMDH is considered and its application for ﬁnancial processes
forecasting at stock markets is described. Experimental investigations of the efﬁ-
ciency of the proposed approach and its comparison with application of Neo-Fuzzy
Neural Network with constant architecture are also presented.
2.8.1
The Neo-fuzzy Neuron
The architecture of the neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) was proposed by Takeshi
Yamakawa and co-authors in [13–15]. The authors of the NFN admit among its
most important advantages, the high rate of learning, computational simplicity, the
possibility of ﬁnding the global minimum of the learning criterion in real time and
also that it is characterized by fuzzy linguistic “if-then” rules. The neo-fuzzy neuron
is a nonlinear multi-input single-output system shown in Fig. 2.14.
It realizes the following mapping:
^y ¼
X
n
i¼1
fiðxiÞ;
ð2:30Þ
where xi is the i-th input (i = 1, 2, …, n), ^y is a system output. Structural blocks of
neo-fuzzy neuron are nonlinear synapses NSi which perform transformation of i-th
input signal in the from
fiðxiÞ ¼

and realize fuzzy inference
IF xi IS xji THEN THE OUTPUT IS wji
where xji is a fuzzy set which membership function is lji, wji is a singleton (synaptic
weight) in consequent. As it can be readily seen nonlinear synapse in fact realizes
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference of zero order [16, 17].
2.8

Conventionally the membership functions ljiðxiÞ in the antecedent are comple-
mentary triangular functions as shown in Fig. 2.15.
For preliminary normalized input variables xi (usually 0  xi  1), membership
functions can be expressed in the form:
ljiðxiÞ ¼
xicj1;i
cjicj1;i ; x 2 ½cj1;i; cji
;
cj þ 1;ixi
cj þ 1;icji ; x 2 ½cji; cj þ 1;i
;
0  otherwise;

:
where cji are arbitrarily selected centers of corresponding membership functions.
Usually they are equally spaced on interval [0, 1]. This contributes to simplify the
fuzzy inference process. That is, an input signal xi activates only two neighboring

membership functions simultaneously and the sum of the grades of these two
membership functions equals to unity (so-called Ruspini partitioning), i.e.
ljiðxiÞ þ lj þ 1;iðxiÞ ¼ 1:
ð2:31Þ
Thus, the fuzzy inference result produced by the Center-of-Gravity defuzziﬁcation
method can be given in the very simple form
fiðxiÞ ¼ wjiljiðxiÞ þ wj þ 1;ilj þ 1;iðxiÞ:
By summing up fiðxiÞ, the output ^y of Eq. (2.1) is produced.

that

piecewise-linear approximation and this fact can in most of the cases can lead to
decreasing of the received results accuracy. To minimize its negative effect we can
increase number of membership functions. But it results in increasing of synaptic
weight coefﬁcients quantity and therefore complexity of our architecture is rising as
well as time required for its learning.
To avoid this disadvantage we propose to use the cubic-spline membership
functions (2.32) that can be written down in the following form:

The cubic-spline activation functions (2.32) satisfy all requirements of the
Ruspini partitioning (2.31) and it is considerably contributes to simplify the fuzzy
inference process. On the other hand, usage of the cubic spline activation functions
provides smooth polynomial approximation instead of piecewise-linear approxi-
mation and makes possible to perform a high quality modeling of signiﬁcantly
nonlinear non-stationary signals and processes.
When a vector signal xðkÞ ¼ ðx1ðkÞ; x2ðkÞ; . . .; xnðkÞÞT (here k ¼ 1; 2; . . . is a
discrete time) is fed to the input of the neo-fuzzy neuron, the output of this neuron is
determined by both the membership functions ljiðxiðkÞÞ and tunable synaptic
weights wjiðk  1Þ, which have been obtained at the previous training epoch:

The Neo-fuzzy Neural Network and Its Architecture

The Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network is a multilayer feedforward architecture that
consists of neo-fuzzy neurons. 3-layers Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network [11] with
n inputs and m outputs is shown of Fig. 2.17.
Given architecture is completely coincide with the structure of the 3-layer per-
ceptron, except that the neo-fuzzy neurons are used here as an elementary nodes
instead of Rosenblatt perceptrons. Therefore, for the adjustment of the weight

coefﬁcients of such architecture it is necessary to use backpropagation algorithms.
As it generally known, such algorithms are quite complex from the computational
point of view and they operate slowly especially in Deep Neural networks with
many layers.
If we use neo-fuzzy neurons that have only two inputs, the GMDH can be
applied for the synthesis of the Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network with optimal
architecture.
The main idea of the GMDH algorithm lay in successive synthesis of the neuron
layers until the external criterion begins to increase.
Algorithm description [11]:
(1) Form pairs from the neo-fuzzy neuron outputs of the current layer (at the ﬁrst
iteration we use the set of input signals). Each pair is fed to the corresponding
neo-fuzzy neuron.
(2) Using the learning subsample adjust synaptic weight coefﬁcient of each
neo-fuzzy neuron.
(3) Using the test subsample calculate the value of the external criterion (regularity)
for each neo-fuzzy neuron:

 are the criterion values for the best neurons of the and s-th and

previous layer and ﬁnd the best neuron that has minimal value of the criterion
(2.35). Otherwise, select F best neurons according to the criterion (2.35) value and
go to the step 1 to construct the next layer of neurons.
(5) Determine the ﬁnal structure of the network. Moving backward from the best
neuron of the (m −1)-th layer along the input connections and passing suc-
cessively all the layers of neurons, preserve in the ﬁnal structure only such
neurons that are used in the next layer.
After the GMDH stops it can be said that the ﬁnal optimal structure of the
Neo-FuzzyNeuralNetworkissynthesized.Asitcanbereadilyseenweobtainnotonly
optimal structure, but also trained neural network that is ready to process new data.
One of the most important advantages of GMDH application for the Deep neural
networks architecture synthesis is a capability to use simple but very quick learning
procedures for the neo-fuzzy neuron weights adjustment because network is trained
layer-by-layer.

the base of current stock prices of the leading Russian companies.
Input data: daily stock prices and the value of RTS index in the period from 5
of February till 5 of May 2009.
The output is RTS index on the next day.
Sample size was 100 values.

1. mean squared error (MSE);
2. mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Conclusions on Experimental Results
After having carried out the series of experiments with neo-fuzzy neural network of
full structure and of optimal structure constructed by GMDH the following results
were obtained which are presented in Table 2.1.
The best results are highlighted with the grey color. As it can be readily seen the
Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network with optimal structure constructed by GMDH gives
better results than the conventional network with full structure (full network).
This may be explained by the utilization of self-organization mechanism for
constructing not full network. But at the same time there are some disadvantages of
this approach—the rate of convergence is slower in comparison with full network.
But taking into account the better criterion values this disadvantage may be
neglected.
For better estimation of the suggested approach the forecasting error obtained at
the experiments is presented on Figs. 2.21 and 2.22. These are the charts of MAPE
obtained by Neo-fuzzy neural network constructed by GMDH.

As we may see while forecasting 1 point ahead we obtain rather high precision—
less than 15%. In case of increase the number of points forecasted the accuracy
drops—the error lies in the range 15–45%.
Analyzing the presented curves we conclude that the Neo-Fuzzy Neural
Network with one hidden layer error is also not high but is not uniformly distributed
and may exceed 30%. For 5 hidden layers the MAPE increases and may reach 35%.
And ﬁnally with 7 layers MAPE reaches 60%. Thus the maximal precision we
obtain with 3 hidden layers.

Solving of the Classiﬁcation Problem Using the Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network
We have applied proposed Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network synthesized by the GMDH
to solve the ‘breast cancer in Wisconsin’ benchmark classiﬁcation problem [11].
Dataset containing 699 points have been used for this purpose (ftp://cs.wisc.edu/
math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/cancer1/datacum).
16
points
had
parameters with missed values so they have been eliminated from the dataset and
remaining 683 points have been separated on training set—478 points (70%) and
test set—205 points (30%).
Each point has 9-dimensional feature vector and 1 class parameter which should
be determined and identiﬁes either benign or malignant tumor has current examined
patient. Features values have been normalized on interval [−1; 1].
For comparison the same classiﬁcation problem was solved using the conven-
tional Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network with full 3-layer structure: 10 NFNs in the ﬁrst
layer, 5 in the seconds, and 1 output NFN. Obtained results of classiﬁcations can be
found in Table 2.2.

When output signal be found within the range [0.3; 0.7] it is lesser probability
that classiﬁcation was correct. We quantify and marked out such classiﬁed samples
as points outside the ‘belief zone’.
We can see that the Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network with architecture synthesized by
the GMDH shows very good results of classiﬁcation and sufﬁciently exceeds in the
classiﬁcation quality as compared with the full network, especially on the testing
set. It can be explained by fact, that full network is a more complex model and as
generally known, complexness of the model leads to generalization loss and
therefore classiﬁcation accuracy decreases. The GMDH allows to synthesis the
optimal structure that neglects inputs which are not signiﬁcant.
In Fig. 2.23 the architecture of the Neo-Fuzzy Neural Network constructed by
the GMDH is shown. It is considerably simpler, than the full network, but in spite
of this it allows to achieve higher classiﬁcation quality.

Evolving GMDH-Neuro-fuzzy Network with Small

Introduction
Nowadays artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) and neuro-fuzzy systems (NFSs) are
widely used for solving different Data Mining tasks, presented either in the form of
“object—property” tables or in the form of multidimensional time series, often
produced by stochastic or chaotic non-stationary nonlinear systems. The advantages
of these computational intelligence systems derive, ﬁrst of all, from their universal
approximating capabilities, learning possibility, transparency and interpretability (in
case of the NFSs) of the results.

Conventionally “learning” is deﬁned as a process of adjusting synaptic weights
using an optimization of a given learning criterion. The quality of this process can be
signiﬁcantly improved by adjusting not only its synaptic weights but also the archi-
tecture of the ANNs and NFSs. This idea is the foundation of evolving computational
intelligence systems (ECIS), that are used more widely in the recent years [18, 19].
It should be noticed that the multilayered neuro-fuzzy systems of TSK- or
ANFIS-type [16, 17, 20–22] are the base of the majority of the known ECIS.
At the same time, speaking of evolving systems, we should mention the Group
Method of Data Handling (GMDH) [12, 23–26], which is a powerful approach of the
information processing system of self-organization. It can synthesize sufﬁciently
simple and effective computational architectures. It is clear that this approach attracted
the attention of the computational intelligence experts. The GMDH-neural networks
having active neurons [26–28], N-adalines [29], R-neurons [30, 31], Q-neurons [3] as
nodes were developed; in the area integrating fuzzy GMDH [32] and neural networks
the GMDH-neuro-fuzzy systems [31, 33] and GMDH-neo-fuzzy systems (see pre-
vious section) [11] were developed; GMDH-wavelet-neuro-fuzzy systems [8, 10, 34]
and GMDH-fuzzy-spiking neural network [9] were also elaborated.
These systems demonstrated their efﬁciency in solving a wide range of tasks,
however they lost the main advantages of the original GMDH, namely small
number of tuning parameters in each node. It should be noted that initially ele-
mentary regression models with two inputs and three estimated coefﬁcients were
developed on the basis of GMDH. These properties of GMDH are especially
important for deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers.
Due to this problem, it seems reasonable to develop a GMDH-system, that
combines advantages of the traditional GMDH, hybrid systems of the computa-
tional intelligence and that is trained with simple learning procedures, used in
regression analysis and linear identiﬁcation theory. The developed approach to this
problem solution is considered below.

layer of the system n  1

is fed. Then this signal is fed to the ﬁrst hidden layer, that contains n1 ¼ c2

 of the
ﬁrst hidden layer the output signals ^y 1½

Þ ¼ c2
n are formed.
Then these signals are fed to the selection block of the ﬁrst hidden layer SB½1
, that
selects among the output signals ^y 1½ 
l
n1 best signals (n1   n, where n1 ¼ F is so
called Freedom of choice) most precise by accepted criterion (mostly by the mean
squared error r2
y½1
l ).
From these n1 best outputs of the ﬁrst hidden layer ^y 1½ 
l  n2 pairwise combi-
nations ^y 1½ 
l ;^y 1½ 
p  are formed, that are fed to the second hidden layer, formed by
neurons N½2
. Among the signals of this layer ^y 2½ 
l
the selection block SB½2
 selects F
best neurons by accuracy (e.g. by r2
y½2
l ) if the best signal of the second layer is better
than the best one of the ﬁrst hidden layer ^y 1½ 
1  : Other hidden layers forms signals
similarly to the second hidden layer. The system evolution process continues until
the best signal of the selection block SB½s þ 1Þ would be worse than the best signal of
the previous (s) layer, that is r2
y½s þ 1
l
[ r2
y½s
l . Then we return to the previous layer and
choose its best node neuron N½s
 in order to form the system output signal ^y½s
.
It should be stressed that we obtain not only optimal network structure but
well-trained network as well due to GMDH algorithm. Besides, since the training is
performed sequentially layer by layer the problems of high dimensionality as well
as decaying or exploding gradient vanish.
This is very important for deep learning networks.
As it was already mentioned, as nodes of GMDH-systems we can use different
types of neurons, e.g. N-Adalines [29], active [26, 27, 35], R-[30, 36], Q-[34],
spiking-[9], wavelet-[8, 10, 34], neo-fuzzy-neurons [11] and other similar com-
putational intelligence systems units, that has the required approximating capabil-
ities and learning capacities. However, the main advantage of the original GMDH
may be lost, namely the ability to work with small training sets (short samples).
Therefore in the next section NFN network with small number of tuning parameters
is considered.
2.9.2
Neuro-fuzzy Network with Small Number of Tuning
Parameters as a Node of GMDH-System
Let us consider the node architecture, shown in Fig. 2.25 and proposed as a neuron
of the suggested evolving GMDH-system. This architecture is in fact a Wang–
Mendel neuro-fuzzy system [22, 37] with only two inputs xi and xj, and one output
^yl. To the node input a two-dimensional vector of signals xðkÞ ¼ xiðkÞ; xjðkÞ

scatter partitioning of input space [35]. Usually the Gaussians are used as mem-

It is easy to see that the node implements nonlinear mapping of input signals to

the conventional least squares method (LSM), traditionally used in the GMDH. If
the entire training set is presented, we can use the LSM in its batch form

Computational Experiments
The efﬁciency of the proposed approach was demonstrated by solving the problem
of the forecasting at the stock exchange.
The experimental investigations for stock prices forecasting were carried out. As
a forecasted variable the RTS index in 2013 with time step one week was chosen.
As external regressors (inputs) stock prices of the leading companies were used.
Total sample had 55 points that was used while searching the optimal partial
description in the GMDH. At each layer we selected 6 best models (freedom choice
F = 6). The mathematical model had the general form y ¼ f x1; x2; x3; x4
ð
Þ.
As the quality criteria of the obtained models MAPE and RMSE were used. The
ﬂow charts of real and simulated values of the RTS index are presented in Fig. 2.26

for N = 2 (here N is a number of fuzzy inputs). The results of experiments are
presented in Table 2.3. The ﬂow charts of criteria values are presented in Figs. 2.27
and 2.28. As one can see, with number of inputs increasing the error values ﬁrst fall
down, but then begin to grow. So increasing the number of inputs until the error
value starts to grow we can obtain the optimal inputs number (Figs. 2.27 and 2.28).

For a comparison models using classical GMDH with linear partial descriptions
and cascade neuro-fuzzy network were constructed. The following parameters for
models construction were set:
– classical GMDH, 50% is training sample size, freedom choice—best 6 models;
– cascade neuro-fuzzy network with different inputs number.
The simulation results for the classical GMDH are presented in Fig. 2.29.
The MAPE value is 0.09845, the RMSE value is 15.1446.
Now let’s construct the model using full cascade neuro-fuzzy network with
different inputs number. The MAPE values for GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network and
for full cascade NFN are presented in Table 2.4.
The ﬂow charts of MAPE for these networks are presented in Fig. 2.30. As one
can see, the GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network showed much better results than the full
cascade neuro-fuzzy network due to more optimal network structure. Also
GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network showed better results comparing with classical
GMDH. The MAPE value for classical GMDH is 0.09845, while the best
GMDH-neuro-fuzzy model has MAPE value 0.039496.

The further experiments were carried out. We added to the inputs several output

Number of inputs is 5. The MAPE value is 0.02040, the RMSE value is 3.59614.
As one can see, after adding the values of the RTS index to inputs prehistory the
model quality has increased.
Let’s consider the prediction quality of the GMDH-neuro-fuzzy model using
another sample. As input sample the stock prices of Microsoft corp. since 01.11.14
to 29.12.14 were used. The sample size is 64 points. A model is constructed using
62 points. The forecast is made for 4 steps ahead, the ﬁrst two steps are checked
with available data. Autoregression model with number of lags 5 is used. As a result
we obtained a GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network with 6 fuzzy inputs. The obtained
results are presented in Tables 2.5 and 2.6.

As one can see, the GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network shows more accurate forecast
than the classical GMDH and the cascade neuro-fuzzy network. Its MAPE value
doesn’t exceed 1% (0.32 and 0.34% while forecasting for 1 and 2 steps ahead).
As the ﬁnal experiment let’s compare the training time for GMDH-neuro-fuzzy
model and full cascade model. In Table 2.7 the training time in seconds for
GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network and full cascade neuro-fuzzy network is presented. As
an initial sample we used Microsoft stock prices in the period since 01.11.14 to
29.12.14, a sample size is 64 points.
Conclusion
In this section the elementary neuro-fuzzy networks with scatter partitioning of
input space and small number of tuning parameters are proposed as nodes of the
GMDH-system. The system architecture can evolve in on-line mode as the synaptic
weights of the proposed neuro-fuzzy nodes-neurons are adjusted. The distin-
guishing feature of the proposed approach is the ability to work with very small
training sets.
The experimental investigations of the neuro-fuzzy network in the problem of
stock prices forecasting were carried out. After investigations results analysis the
following conclusions were made:
– the variation of inputs number in GMDH-neuro-fuzzy network inﬂuences the
model quality: as a number of inputs increases the error ﬁrst falls down, and then
begins to grow; it enables to choose the optimal inputs number;
– the application of the proposed approach for optimal structure search allows to
decrease training time and to increase the forecasting quality of the model
comparing with full-cascade deep fuzzy network.

in real-world (online) applications, especially under conditions of a growing effect
of the dynamic data context, sequential video analysis, and web mining. This
demand is justiﬁed by the growing dynamic and complexity of current problems as
well as the ascending volumes of data bases (BD), which lead to the fact that
traditional batch training is not possible any more to be applied within some rea-
sonable time period and tolerable accuracy [1–4]. The evolving incremental
learning systems should process huge amounts of data, analyze the data rapidly and
extract data features on the ﬂy. Since the data is transforming permanently, these
systems must be capable of adapting their topology.
From the algorithmic point of view, the evolving system should be able to carry
out some parametric adaptation. Stated another way, it has to be contributed by a set
of parameters along with adaptation of the required tweaks to be implemented
effectively [20, 21, 26–28, 35].
It’s well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) [1–4] have gained a high
impact on data processing recently. Although this class of networks is quite bulky
when speaking of the computational implementation. And there’s a high possibility
that the overﬁtting problem takes a place while dealing with a short training data set.
As an alternative view, it is also reasonable to generate DNN architectures on the
grounds of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) [8–12, 23–25]. In this
connection, various systems from the area of Computational Intelligence usually
enhance automatically a number of their structure layers for information handling in
order to obtain the precision on demand for results. That’s a great deal of sense to
separate an initial space somehow into a suite of subspaces in lower dimensions and
combine the results obtained. The Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)
possesses an apparent beneﬁt from a computational point of view. But its huge
drawback is its rather poor adaptation for an online mode. That is a rather smart
decision to apply GMDH characteristics to evolving cascade neural networks [8–
11, 34], although some of these systems might freeze their parameter values.
A speciﬁcally new subject of interest is a combination of hybrid systems of
computational intelligence and the GMDH concepts with the general aim of new
computational and theoretical results especially for Big Data Mining and Data
Stream Mining [38, 39]. The GMDH-ANN topologies have been considered in [5]
in terms of using speciﬁc two-input N-Adalines as structural elements. A main
purpose of this topological element was to guarantee a quadratic approximation for
recovering a non-linear mapping. Meanwhile, estimating the achieved quality could
lead to a substantial quantity of hidden layers.
In the previous sections cascade GMDH-neo-fuzzy network and evolving
GMDH-neuro-fuzzy networks and their training algorithms were considered which
showed high operating speed and high approximating abilities as main performance
indicators. Although both its parameters and framework are being adjusted in an
online mode, but it still claims long enough training data sets.
That’s a very challenging task when there’s an obvious lack of incoming data (a
short data set), and the system is not capable of tuning its parameters.
In this regard, it’s highly important to offer a hybrid neuro-fuzzy system to be
trained in an online fashion and to be able of optimizing its topology while being
86

trained. That’s also very topical to introduce the system that keeps in possession an
appreciably lower number of attributes to be tweaked in comparison with other
well-known compatible systems.
2.10.1
An Architecture of the Deep GMDH Neuro-fuzzy
System
A structure of the deep GMDH neuro-fuzzy system is given in Fig. 2.31. The
receptive (zero) layer of the system contains a n  1

signals xðkÞ ¼ x1ðkÞ; x2ðkÞ; . . .; xnðkÞ

ÞT (k ¼ 1; 2; . . .; N denotes in this case either
an observation in a training set or an index of the current discrete time). This vector
is subsequently addressed to the ﬁrst hidden layer that comprises n1 ¼ c2
n elements
(every element owns only two inputs).
There is a special type of elements (the selection block) that accounts for
choosing the best node in the strict sense of precision (in terms of an accepted
criterion). For instance, the selection block in the ﬁrst layer SB½1
 selects n

Afterwards, n2 pairwise combinations ^y 1½

p ðkÞ are composed (in most
cases, n  n2  2n) among the mentioned above n

obtained are later propagated to the second hidden layer composed by nodes N½2
 in
a similar manner to the neurons N½1
. The selection block of the second hidden layer
SB½2
 takes only signals which are better than ^y 1½

2.10.1.1
The Extended Neo-fuzzy Neuron
A model of the extended NFN was put forward in [40] as a further development and
evolution of an ordinary neo-fuzzy neuron submitted by Yamakawa, Miki and
Uchino [13–15].
A traditional version of the neo-fuzzy neuron is a MISO (multiple inputs and a
single output) non-linear system that accounts for the permutation
^y ¼
X
n
i¼1
fi xi
ð Þ
where xi signiﬁes an i component in the input vector x ¼ x1; . . .; xi; . . .; xn
ð
ÞT2 Rn
(of the dimensionality n), ^y marks a scalar output of the neo-fuzzy neuron. In its
usual form, NFN embodies multiple (non-linear) synapses NSi. Their purpose is to
modify the ith vector element in xi into
fi xi
ð Þ ¼
X
h
l¼1
wlilli xi
ð Þ
where h is the number of membership functions, wli deﬁnes a synaptic weight l in
the ith non-linear synapse, l ¼ 1; 2; . . .; h, i ¼ 1; 2; . . .; n; lli xi
ð Þ describes the lth
membership function in the non-linear synapse i that makes a great impact on
fuzziﬁcation of a crisp element xi. By such manners, the permutation ensured by the
NFN could be noted down like
^y ¼
X
n
i¼1
X
h
l¼1
wlilli xi
ð Þ
The NFN provides the fuzzy inference rule put into action in the form
IF xi IS Xli THEN THE OUTPUT IS
wli; l ¼ 1; 2; . . .; h
which consequently infers that the synapse truthfully endows the 0th order fuzzy
inference by Takagi-Sugeno [16, 17].
As mentioned previously, the NFN’s synapse NSi covers the 0-order inference
by Takagi-Sugeno only producing the simplest Wang-Mendel neuro-fuzzy system
[41, 42]. It seems quite valid to expand approximating capabilities of this com-
putational node by introducing a speciﬁed topological element to have been called
an “extended nonlinear synapse” [40] ðENSiÞ and to develop the “extended
neo-fuzzy neuron” (ENFN) that embraces ENSi units instead of conventional
synapses NSi.

The ENFN’s framework is not so complicated in comparison with the con-

and the extended neo-fuzzy synapse are given in Figs. 2.32 and 2.33.
The usage of the scatter partitioning of the input space [21] can cause the
appearing of “gaps” in the fuzziﬁed space. To avoid this problem one can use the
bell-shaped constructions with non-strictly local receptive support as membership
functions. Mostly the Gaussians are used as membership functions of the ﬁrst layer

In this way, all the system nodes’ parameters (synaptic weights, centers and
width parameters for the membership functions) may be adjusted. Concerning the
successive layers, the nodes’ parameters are usually tuned quite the same way as the
nodes in the ﬁrst hidden layer.

An Experimental Study
The Darwin sea level pressure data set was chosen from the Data Market data
storage to showcase a advantage of the offered deep GMDH system and its learning
schemes. It was mainly used for non-stationary signals’ prediction. The data set
presents chieﬂy a monthly sea level pressure for a period of more than a century
(1882–1998). A general size of this data sample is 1400 observations. The system
used 1100 observations to get trained and 300 observations to get tested. To

estimate the efﬁciency of the proposed neuro-fuzzy system is, we also considered a
multilayer perceptron, a radial-basis function neural network, and ANFIS for
solving the same task. The results obtained were estimated according to the MSE
criterion. Table 2.8 gives a demonstration of the systems’ performance. The pro-
posed deep GMDH system illustrated quite good results while handling the pre-
diction task. It is worth mentioning that its training time was short enough
compared to analogues. At the same time, its forecasting results were the best ones
for this data set. Figure 2.34 demonstrates a fragment of the learning process.
Conclusion
In this chapter new class of neural networks—Deep networks are considered and
their learning algorithms are presented and discussed. For deep learning imple-
mentation encoders-decoders, restricted Boltzman machines (RBM) and stacked
RBM are used. The main problems connected with Deep learning—vanishing and
exploding gradient are considered and methods of their solution are presented and
discussed.
New approach to Deep learning based on application of GMDH to synthesis and
learning of neuro-fuzzy networks is suggested and developed in this chapter.
The deep evolving neuro-fuzzy system presented here doesn’t require any high
data volumes to get trained. The hybrid system is grounded on both the Group
Method of Data Handling and the concept of evolving systems that makes it
possible to deﬁne both optimal parameter values and the best structure in every
speciﬁc case. Adjusting parameters in a parallel fashion gives an option of
increasing a processing speed of data handling. The system’s architecture may be
evolving in an online mode as the synaptic weights, centers and widths’ parameters
of the proposed neuro-fuzzy nodes are being tuned. This approach enables to
overcome some problems of Big Data dimensionality in practical tasks of fore-
casting, classiﬁcation and pattern recognition.

Pattern Recognition in Big Data

3.1
Introduction
Data classiﬁcation and pattern recognition substitute one of the widely used class of
problems in Data Mining. Up to date many methods and algorithms were developed
for pattern recognition in different spheres of science and technology. Most of the
modern methods of classiﬁcation may be divided into following classes:
(1) methods based on statistical decision-making theory, incl. Bayesian methods
based on application of conditional probability distributions;
(2) methods of discriminant analysis, incl. well-known SVM method and its
derivatives;
(3) algebraic and linguistic methods;
(4) neural networks;
(5) fuzzy logic systems and fuzzy neural networks (FNN);
(6) special methods.
But for solution of classiﬁcation problems with BD it’s extremely important is the
development of new adequate methods or further improvement of existing methods
which take into account the high dimension of BD warehouses. Most of them use
various approaches and algorithms of dimensionality reduction, e.g. Principal
component method (PCM) and similar techniques.
Another constructive approach for BD dimensionality reduction is hierarchical
organization of data.
In this chapter classiﬁcation method based FNN is considered and some algo-
rithms of classiﬁcation problems dimensionality reduction are presented and dis-
cussed. In the Sect. 3.2 FNN NEFClass is considered Its architecture and training
algorithm
is
presented
and
investigated.
In

NEFClass M is described free of some drawbacks of basic FNN NEFCLass its
training algorithms are described and analyzed.

In Sect. 3.5 application of FNN NEFClass M for optical images recognition
obtained with multi spectral system is presented and analyzed. In the Sect. 3.6
implementation of FNN for medical images of uterus classiﬁcation in the problem
of express diagnostics is considered.
In the Sect. 3.7 the hybrid CNN-FNN network is considered which was sug-
gested for medical images of breast tumor recognition in the problem of medical
diagnostics. The experimental of the suggested approach are presented and its
practical implementation for medical images classiﬁcation and is described. The
reduction of features dimensionality in his problem was considered and for its
solution Principal components method was suggested and its efﬁciency was esti-
mated. The suggested approach may be used for solution BD classiﬁcation
problems.
3.2
FNN NEFClass. Architecture, Properties,
the Algorithms of Learning of Base Rules
and Membership Functions
A classiﬁcation problem is one of the most actual spheres of application of the
computational intelligence systems. For its decision different approaches and
methods were suggested, among which popular solutions were offered, combining
neural networks and fuzzy inference systems. One of such decisions is the system
NEFClass (NEuro-Fuzzy CLASSiﬁer), based on the generalized architecture of
fuzzy perceptron and suggested by D. Nauck and R. Kruse in [1–3].
Both original and modiﬁed model of NEFClass are derivative from the general
model of fuzzy perceptron [4]. A model purpose is a development of fuzzy rules
from a set of data which can be divided into the several non-overlapping classes.
The fuzziness arises up due to the imperfect or incomplete measuring of properties
of objects, subject to classiﬁcation.
Fuzzy rules, describing expert information, have the following form:
if is l1i and x2 is l2i and … and xn is lni, then pattern ðx1; x2; . . .; xnÞ belongs to
the class of i,
where l1i; . . .; lni; are MF of fuzzy sets.
The goal of NEFClass is to deﬁne these rules, as well as parameters of mem-
bership functions for fuzzy sets. It was assumed here, that intersection of two
different sets is empty.
The system NEFClass has 3-layer successive architecture (see Fig. 3.1). The ﬁrst
layer U1 contains inputs neurons which inputs patterns are fed in. Activating of
these neurons does not change usually input values. The hidden layer U2 contains
fuzzy rules, and the third layer U3 consists of output neurons (classiﬁers).

Activations of rule neurons and neurons of output layer with the pattern of p are
calculated so:

ð3:1Þ

R Þ;
ð3:2Þ
or alternatively
aðpÞ
C ¼ max
R2U2 aðpÞ

;
ð3:3Þ
where Wðx; rÞ is a fuzzy weight of connection of input neuron x with a rule neuron
R, and WðR; cÞ—fuzzy weight of connection of a rule neuron R with the neuron c of
output layer. Instead of application of operations of maximum and minimum it is
possible to use other functions of so-called “t-norm” and “t-co-norm” accordingly
[1].
A rule base is approximation of unknown function and describes a classiﬁcation
task /ðxÞ, such, that ci ¼ 1; cj ¼ 0 ðj ¼ 1; . . .; m; 8 j 6¼ iÞ, if pattern x belongs to
the class Ci.
Every fuzzy set is marked a linguistic term, such as «large», «small», «middle»
et cetera. Fuzzy sets and linguistic rules present approximation of classifying

function and determine the result of the system NEFClass. They are obtained from a
sample by learning. It’s necessary, that for every linguistic value (for example, «x1
is positive and large») there should be only one presentation of fuzzy set.
Learning in the System NEFClass
The system NEFClass can be built on partial knowledge about patterns. An user
must deﬁne the amount of initial fuzzy sets for each of object features (number of
terms) and set the value kmax that is a maximal number of rule nodes, which can be
created in the hidden layer. For learning triangular MF are used.
Consider the system of NEFClass with n input neurons x1; . . .; xn; k ðk  kmaxÞ
rule neurons and m output neurons c1; . . .; cm;. The learning sample of patterns is
also given: L ¼
p1; t1
ð
Þ; . . .; ps; ts
ð
Þ
f
g, each of which consists of input pattern p 2
Rn and desired pattern t 2 0; 1
f
gm.
A learning algorithm consists of two stages.
Stage 1. Generation of rule base.
The ﬁrst stage whose purpose is to create rule neurons of the system NEFClass
consists of the followings steps [1–3]:
1. Choose a next pattern p; t
ð
Þ from sample L.
2. For every input neuron xi 2 U1 ﬁnd such membership li
Ji that
lðiÞ
Ji ¼ max

ji ðpiÞg;
ð3:4Þ
where xi ¼ pi
3. If a number of rule nodes k is less than kmax and there is no rule node R such, that
Wðx1; RÞ ¼ lJ1; . . .; Wðxn; RÞ ¼ lJn
then create such node and connect it with an output node ci, if ti ¼ 1, and connect it
with all input neurons and assign the corresponding weights li
Ji to connections.
4. If there are still not-processed patterns in L and k\kmax, then go to the step 1
and continue learning using next pattern, and otherwise stop.
5. Determine a rule base by one of three procedures:
a. “Simple” rules learning: we leave the ﬁrst k rules only (stop creation of rules,
if it was created k ¼ kmax rules).
b. The “best” learning rules: we process patterns in L and accumulate activating
of every rule neuron for every class of patterns which were entered into
system NEFClass. If rule neuron R shows the greater accumulation of
activating for a class Cj than for a class CR, which was speciﬁed initially for

this rule, then change implication of rule R from CR to Cj, that means
connect R with the output neuron cj. We continue processing of patterns in
L farther and calculate for every rule neuron the activation function:

Learning of Fuzzy Sets MF
Stage 2
On the second stage learning of parameters of membership functions (MF) of fuzzy
sets is performed. A learning algorithm with teacher of the system NEFClass must
adapt MF of fuzzy sets. The algorithm cyclic runs through all learning patterns of
the sample L, executing the following steps, until one of stop criteria will be
fulﬁlled [1–3].
Steps:
1. Choose a next pattern (p, t) from sample L, enter it into FNN NEFclass and
determine an output vector c.
2. For every output neuron ci calculate the value dCi

where ti is a desired output, aci is an real output of neuron ci.

Analysis NEFClass Properties. The Modiﬁed
System NEFClassM
FNN NEFClass has several obvious advantages, distinguishing it among the other
classiﬁcation systems. The most important are: easiness of implementation,
high-speed algorithms of learning, as well as that is the most important, high
accuracy of data classiﬁcation—at the level of the best systems in this area.
However, the basic system NEFClass has some shortcomings:
1. formulas used for parameters learning are empirical in nature, in addition,
2. it is not clear how to choose in the learning algorithm the learning speed
parameter r.
Therefore, these shortcomings were deleted in the modiﬁcation of basic system –
so-called system NEFClass-M (modiﬁed) developed in [5].
102
3
Pattern Recognition in Big Data Analysis

Randomization and careful selection rate constants learning r are inherent
properties of the system NEFCLASS-M. These properties have been designed to
mitigate the impact some of the shortcomings the original model and have made it
possible to achieve a signiﬁcant improvement in the quality of classiﬁcation.
Randomization. Because of the nature of the training algorithm “simple” rules
base and learning algorithm of fuzzy sets, the outcome of the training network for
these algorithms are highly dependent on order, in which samples are represented in
a learning sample. If, for example, the samples will be sorted by classes, the system
will better classify the patterns of one class and substantially worse—the patterns of
the other class. Ideally, the patterns in the training sample must be randomly mixed,
in order to avoid the negative effect.
Implementation of the system NEFClassM [5] avoids this complexity by “ran-
domization of patterns order in a learning sample after its boot. Moreover, such
“randomization” occurs before each iteration of learning algorithm. As further
experiments had shown, this allows to achieve a more stable and, often, the better
classiﬁcation results, which do not depend on the order in which patterns in a
learning sample has been submitted by a user.
Choice of speed training. In the learning algorithm of fuzzy sets in the model
NEFCLASS is used parameter training speed r. As experiments had shown, carried
out in the course of developing the NEFClass M, this parameter plays a vital role in
the success of the training.
The experiments had shown that, under other parameters being equal, for each
speciﬁc task training there exists a certain value r, which ensures a minimum
percentage of erroneous classiﬁcation after the training. Unfortunately, to obtain
analytical dependence for optimal parameter value is very difﬁcult because learning
algorithm NEFCLASS as a whole is empirical; however, using search and try
method it was found that for many tasks optimal value r lies in the narrow range
[0.06–0.1], in particular it may be equal to 0.07. This value has been set for the
program which implements a modiﬁed model NEFClass M [5].
3.3.1
The Modiﬁed Model NEFCLASS
Consider the basic shortcomings in the NEFCLass learning algorithm.
The analysis of the drawbacks of NEFCLASS has shown that their principal
cause lies mostly in an empirical learning algorithm of fuzzy sets. Therefore, a
natural approach, aimed to correct the situation, was the replacement of empirical
learning algorithm by the strict optimization algorithm with all the ensuing con-
sequences for network architecture and algorithms.
Both the original and modiﬁed model NEFCLASS are based on the architecture
of a fuzzy perceptron [1, 5, 6]. Architectural differences of the original and the
modiﬁed model lie in the form of membership functions of fuzzy sets, function

t-norm for calculation rules activations of neurons, as well as aggregating function
(t-conorms), determining the activation of output neurons.
The application of numerical optimization methods requires differentiability of
the membership functions of fuzzy sets—condition to which the triangular mem-
bership functions don’t satisfy. Therefore the modiﬁed model of fuzzy sets uses the
Gaussian membership functions, described as
lðxÞ ¼ exp
 ðx  aÞ2
2b2
(
)
:
This membership function is deﬁned by two parameters—a and b. The
requirement of differentiability also dictates the choice of t-norms (intersections) for
calculating neuron activation rules. In the system NEFCLASS for this operation is
used minimum; in the modiﬁed system NEFCLASS-M -product of the corre-
sponding values.
Finally, the kind of aggregate function (t-conorm) for modiﬁed model is limited
only by the weighted sum. The reason consists in the fact that the maximum
function which is used in the original system also does not satisfy the condition of
differentiability. The main change is obviously relates to a learning algorithm of
fuzzy sets. The objective function in the modiﬁed system NEFClass is minimization
of the mean squared error on the training sample by analogy with the classical
(clear) neural networks:

where j is a index of the true class to which this pattern p belongs, i is classiﬁcation

reducing MSE for the training set is the aggregate vector of parameters a and b of
FNN. As a speciﬁc training method can be used any method unconstrained opti-
mization such as the gradient method or the conjugate gradient method, these both
methods were implemented in this investigation.

Experimental Studies. Comparative Analysis of FNN
NEFClass and NEFClass-M in Classiﬁcation Problems
Experiments were conducted on the classiﬁcation of the two sets of data IRIS and
WBC [5, 6]. Selection of IRIS and WBC test kits was dictated by two considerations:
ﬁrstly, these sets can be considered standard for classiﬁcation problems, and sec-
ondly, in the original works of authors NEFCLASS model was tested on these data
sets [1–3]. This allows to compare the results of the base system NEFCLASS with a
modiﬁed NEFCLASS_M and estimate the effect of introduced improvements.
IRIS Data Set
IRIS set contains 150 samples belonging to three different classes (Iris Setosa, Iris
Versicolour, and Iris Virginica), 50 samples of each class. Each sample is char-
acterized by four properties. IRIS is the only one set by classiﬁcation simplicity for
which even a simple strategy of rules selection gives good results.
In the ﬁrst experiment, in a modiﬁed model NEFClass-M “simple” rules learning
algorithm was used, and their number was limited to 10 with 3 fuzzy sets per variable
(all other parameters were set to the default values). As a result, the system has created
10 rules and achieved only 4 classiﬁcation errors of the 150 (i.e. 97.3% correct) patterns.
The best result, which was managed to achieve with the “simple” rules learning
algorithm is three rules with two essential variables, x3 and x4, and the same order
of misclassiﬁcation (4 errors) [5]:
R1: IF (any, any, large, large) THEN Class 3
R2: IF (any, any, medium, medium) THEN Class 2
R3: IF (any, any, small, small) THEN Class 1
The same result was achieved for the “better” and “best in class” rules learning
algorithms. However, for the last two algorithms it’s possible further reduction in
the number of fuzzy sets for variable x3 and x4 under the following rules (6 erro-
neous classiﬁcation):
R1: IF (any, any, small, small) THEN Class 1
R2: IF (any, any, large, small) THEN Class 2
R3: IF (any, any, large, large) THEN Class 3
The authors model NEFCLASS obtained the similar results, except that in their
experiments, they used three fuzzy sets (linguistic values) for x3 and x4 [1, 2]. Thus,
for a set of data IRIS it was managed to achieve better results than in the original
works—exclusively simple set rules of two variables with only two decomposing
sets for each variable.
Dataset WBC
The next test sample for classiﬁcation was standard data sample Wisconsin Breast
Cancer (WBC). When processing sample Wisconsin Breast Cancer using system

NEFClass-M interesting results were obtained which didn’t always coincide with
the results of the basic model NEFCLASS.
Following the course of the experiments by the authors of NEFCLASS [1, 2] for
system training rule base learning algorithm with the “best in the class” (three sets
in the variable). was used with maximum 4 rules. The resulting error of misclas-
siﬁcation obtained for the system NEFClass-M was 28 patterns of 663 (95.7%
correct) [7]. Very interesting is the fact that for model NEFClass for similar
parameters correct classiﬁcation value was only 80.4% (135 misclassiﬁcation).
This is a signiﬁcant advantage of the modiﬁed system NEFClass-M which can
be explained by suggested modiﬁcations that distinguish this model from basic
NEFCLASS model, namely, the use of randomization algorithm, the choice of
learning rate and application of numerical algorithm of optimization (gradient
method for MF learning.
The best result that was managed to obtain for the data set WBC is the rule base of 8
ruleswithﬁveessentialvariablesx1; x2; x4; x6 and x9 (misclassiﬁcation—19 errors) [5]:
R1: IF (small, small, any, small, any, small, any, any, small) THEN Class 1
R2: IF (small, small, any, large, any, small, any, any, small) THEN Class 1
R3: IF (small, small, any, small, any, small, any, any, large) THEN Class 1
R4: IF (large, large, any, small, any, large, any, any, small) THEN Class 2
R5: IF (large, large, any, large, any, small, any, any, small) THEN Class 2
R6: IF (small, large, any, small, any, large, any, any, small) THEN Class 2
R7: IF (large, small, any, small, any, small, any, any, small) THEN Class 2
R8: IF (large, small, any, small, any, small, any, any, large) THEN Class 2
Comparable results (24 misclassiﬁcation) were obtained with the use of a
maximum of 2 rules (“the best in the class”) with all the important variables, except
x5 and x7:
R1: IF (small, small, small, small, any, small, any, small, small) THEN Class 1
R2: IF (large, large, large, small, any, large, any, large, small) THEN Class 2
Thus, the results obtained by NEFCLASS-M are superior over basic model
NEFCLASS both in number of rules/signiﬁcant variables and classiﬁcation accu-
racy. This conﬁrms the efﬁciency of the modiﬁcations made to the model
NEFClass: randomization, the correct choice of speed training and application of
numerical optimization algorithms.

[8, 9]. For these purposes, accounting the complexity of the problem as well as a
large level of noise it was suggested to use fuzzy neural networks, in particular
NEFClass. In order to organize the training of FNN NEFClass a number of learning
algorithms were developed—gradient, conjugate gradient and genetic ones and
their efﬁciency was investigated and compared to the basic training algorithm of the
system NEFClass [1, 2].
3.5.1
Gradient Learning Algorithm for NEFClass
For the ﬁrst stage of the algorithm—learning rule base the ﬁrst phase of the basic
algorithm NEFClass is used. The second stage uses a gradient algorithm for training
the feedforward neural network, which is described below [5, 8].

The gradient method is the ﬁrst proposed learning algorithm, it is easy to
implement, but has the disadvantages:
1. converges slowly;
2. only ﬁnds a local extremum.
Conjugate Gradient Method for the System NEFClass
Conjugate gradient algorithm, as well as more general algorithm of conjugate
directions, was used in the ﬁeld of optimization thanks to a wide class of problems
for which it ensures the convergence to the optimal solution for a ﬁnite number of
steps. Its description is considered in [9] and isn’t described here.
3.5.2
Genetic Method for Training System NEFClass
Consider the implementation of a genetic algorithm to train NEFCLASS. This
algorithm is a global optimization algorithm. It uses the following mechanisms [9]:
1. crossing-over pairs of parents and generation of descendants;
2. mutation (random effects of the action);
3. the natural selection of the best (selection).

Then the crossing of selected pairs is performed.

selection may be used.
1. Complete replacement of the old to the new population.
2. Selecting the best N of all existing species Npar þ Nch by the criterion of max-

After the crossing, mutation and selection of the current iteration ends. The
iterations are repeated until one of the stop criteria will be fulﬁlled.

For images processing the electro-optical imaging system ENVI was used and its

different spectral cameras [8]. This enables to get a multispectral image. In the
Fig. 3.2 initial data for mapping are shown.
After selecting the 15 control points in the images in different spectrum (this
function is not automated) images are merged and we get the so-called multispectral
cube. The result is shown in Fig. 3.3.
On the images there were nine different types of surfaces that need to be clas-
siﬁed. For analysis and processing, so-called ROI (Region of Interest) on images
were used. On the image homogeneous region was determined, for example, sand,
water, foam, target red target white color and so on. The result of this detection can
be seen in Fig. 3.4.
Next, using a processing system the mean value and the variance of the selected
region were received. The data obtained were later tabulated.

These data characterize the nine classes of surface areas [8]:
• white target; red target; green target; blue target; yellow target; foam; water; dry
sand; wet sand.
For classiﬁcation of objects it was suggested to use FNN NEFClass_M [8].
These types of surfaces correspond to nine output nodes in the system
NEFClass_M.
The total number of features used to classify the kinds of surfaces is four,
namely:
• the brightness in the red spectrum (RS);
• the brightness in the blue spectrum (BS);
• the brightness in the green spectrum (GS);
• brightness in the infrared spectrum (IS).
The total number of data is 99, 11 for each class.
Present the main statistical characteristics of the data set obtained by multi-
spectral system «Mantis» (Tables 3.1 and 3.2) [8].
To explore the effectiveness of various learning algorithms in the problem of
electro-optical image recognition using NEFClass software kit was developed
named NEFClass- BGCGG (Basic, Gradient, Conjugate Gradient, Genetic) [8, 9].
Further experiments were carried out with the software kit NEFClass-BGCGG.
According to the basic principle of model investigation experiments were carried
out by changing only one parameter each time. Of the available 99 patterns 54
patterns served as a training sample. The other 45 patterns were used for testing.
The values of the basic parameters of the simulation algorithm were set to the
starting positions (see Table 3.3):
During the process of training 15 rules was generated presented in the Table 3.4.

The dependence of the quality of training on the number of rules that are
generated in the ﬁrst stage was investigated. For an objective assessment of the
results testing on the test sample was performed. For this purpose we varied the
number of rules, starting from 9 to 14. The results are shown in the Table 3.5.
The obtained result is natural, the more rules, the better the results of the test
classiﬁcation.
We have investigated the effect of the terms number in features on the quality of
classiﬁcation. Comparative table is given below (see Table 3.6)
Very interesting result was obtained in this series of experiments [8].
From the Table 3.6 it follows that there exists an optimal number of terms that
can be used to describe a collection of data during training. When the number of
terms exceeds this value the number of misclassiﬁed samples increases, that is, by
increasing the complexity of the model error increases.

System training using classical algorithm with the optimal number of terms in
the features was performed. Forms of membership functions for each feature are
shown in Fig. 3.5.
The total sum of squared errors was 2.852081, the number of erroneous clas-
siﬁcations—zero in the training set, while for the test sample MSE was equal to
4.6252, which is not bad result.

Experiments with the gradient algorithm. The results are shown in Fig. 3.6 (MF
of fuzzy sets for each of the four features).
An error at the end of the training was 2.042015, that a little bit better than for
classical method. When testing MSE was 3.786005, and the portion of misclassi-
ﬁcation was 4%.
Further, the option automatic speed adjustment of MF parameters was included,
that is, we used the algorithm “golden section” for step value optimization. The
results are shown below (Fig. 3.7).
The same experiments were carried out with a conjugate gradient algorithm. The
results are shown in Fig. 3.8.
Further the method of golden section was added to training algorithm. The
results can be seen in Fig. 3.9.
Finally, experiments with a genetic algorithm with different MF—triangular and
Gaussian were carried out [8].
The results of learning using different algorithms are presented in the compar-
ative charts (Fig. 3.10) and Table 3.7. Note that for the training sample excellent
results by the criterion of the percentage of misclassiﬁcation were obtained for all
algorithms.

For all algorithms, this criterion is zero. However, on the test sample, the results
were worse: at least two samples were misclassiﬁed. Also the sum of squared error
(MSE) for all, without exception, learning algorithms increased. For ease of
comparison, the number of iterations (epochs) has been limited to 50.
As can be seen, the results are satisfactory, the level of correct classiﬁcation on
the test sample is 96%. These results may be improved by forming a more repre-
sentative sample.
Analyzing the curves in the Fig. 3.10 it can be clearly seen that the best method
for the rate of convergence is the conjugate gradient method. Then the next is a
genetic algorithm with Gaussian function. Less effective is the gradient method.
Next by rate of convergence is classical algorithm used in the system NEFClass.
And at the end of row the least effective is genetic method with a triangular
membership function.
However, the MSE criterion by which the curves were plotted, displays
ambiguously classiﬁcation quality. An important criterion for evaluation of meth-
ods efﬁciency is the minimum number of misclassiﬁed samples. From Table 3.7
one can see that all algorithms show the same results with respect to this criterion.

Introduction
An important application sphere of pattern recognition systems is the problem of
classiﬁcation of optical medical images and diagnostics in medicine. Especially it
relates to state recognition of human organs tissue and early detection of possible
cancer. One of such tasks is cervix epithelium state analysis and diagnostics using
optical images obtained with colposcope (a method of survey of a mucous

optical increase with the help of a colposcope) [10]. As a result of carrying out a
colposcopy by the doctor the increased pictures of images with preliminary splitting
into classes of diseases are provided. The problem of classiﬁcation cervix epithe-
lium state using images obtained with colposcope was considered in [10, 11] where
for its solution was suggested the application of crisp neural networks Back
propagation, neural networks with radial basis functions (RBFNN) and cascade
RBFNN and their efﬁciency investigated. The goal of this presentation is the
investigation of fuzzy neural network NEFClass for recognition of state of cervix
epithelium in medical diagnostics and comparison of its efﬁciency with conven-
tional RBF network.
3.6.1
Problem Statement
The problem consists in classiﬁcation of obtained medical images using special
medical tools: computer tomography, magneto-resonance tomography, colposcope
etc.
In medical images values of the color model RGB represent components of input
vector and based on this information it’s needed to deﬁne, which class it should be
referred to. The classiﬁer thus refers object to one of classes according to a certain
splitting of N-dimensional space which is called as input space, and dimension of
this space is a number of vector components.
For the solution of cervix epithelium state analysis and diagnostics problem
using optical images theNefClass network with Gaussian membership function was
suggested
3.6.2
Training of NEFClass System
The NEFClass system can be constructed on partial knowledge of samples. The
user has to deﬁne quantity of initial fuzzy sets for each of object feature, and set
value kmax—the maximum number of nodes rules which can be created in the
hidden layer. Membership functions of Gauss and gradient algorithm of training of
fuzzy sets are used for training.
Let’s consider stages of recognition process.
1. Work with data. Construct a database of examples, characteristic for this task.
Split all data set into two sets: training and test in the following ratio:
• training 50%, test 50%;
• training 60%, test 40%;
• training 70%, test 30%;
• training 80%, test 20%;
120
3

• training 90%, test 10%;
2. Preliminary processing. Choose system of features, characteristic for this task,
and transform data appropriately that is to be fed into network inputs. As a result
it is desirable to receive linearly separated space of a set of samples. As input
data medical images of benign processes, are used namely:
• inﬂammatory processes in the form of branching of vessels;
• cervical erosion;
• traumatic deformation;
• large cervical ectropion.
• small cervical ectropion.
Each of these diseases is presented by a number of features which is to be
classiﬁed by a neural network and are shown in the Figs. 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14,
3.15 and 3.16.
3. Designing, training and assessment of a network work quality. At this stage the
number of rules, quantity of fuzzy sets and percentage ratio of training and
testing samples are determined.
4. Choosing algorithm of a network training. As a training algorithm the gradient
method was used. At this stage it is necessary to specify the accuracy, the steps
size for all variables and a number of iterations.
5. Application and diagnosing. At the last stage we receive result of application of
the neural NefClass network to a problem of medical diagnostics. We observe
splitting images into RGB to the color scheme and a class to which the sample
initially belonged. Also we obtain the result of recognition—a class to which the
sample after training of a neural network belongs. The amount of misclassiﬁ-
cations and an average error on sample are determined.

Experimental Investigations
The experimental investigations were carried out on real images of cervix uterus.
Sample size consisted of 70 elements which contained 5 classiﬁcations of diseases.
In process of experiments the training/test sample ratio, number of fuzzy sets of
linguistic variables and number of rules were varied.
The results of classiﬁcation after training at training and test samples for various
training/test samples ratio, number of fuzzy sets are presented in the Table 3.8 [12].
Figures 3.17, 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 shows the dependence of ratio training/testing
samples on the mean squared error and misclassiﬁcation % (MAPE) for different
number of fuzzy sets for each variable (feature).
The next step in experiments was determination of results change due to vari-
ation of the rules number. For each number of fuzzy sets (3, 6, 7, and 11) training/
test sample ratio was used. It should be noted there is a number of rules, after which
there is no change in the classiﬁcation of samples and in the mean square error. The
results are shown in Table 3.9 [12].
Comparison of the fuzzy neural network NefClass efﬁciency with the neural
network RBF was performed. The results of RBF are shown in Table 3.10.
Conclusions
1. The problem of recognition of objects on medical images in medical diagnostics
is considered. The investigations were performed on the cervix uterus images
obtained using colposcope. 70 images were selected which contained 5 classi-
ﬁcations of diseases.
2. Fuzzy neural network NefClass and non- fuzzy neural network RBF were used
for classiﬁcation. Experiments were carried out on training/test samples in the
ratios: 50/50, 60/40, 70/30, 80/20 and 90/10.

testing) was calculated. The best result was obtained for samples ratio 90/10, for
which in the case of 6 sets were correctly classiﬁed all the patterns, while with
11 sets 6 patterns were correctly classiﬁed, 1 was classiﬁed incorrectly. The
worst results were with 3 and 7 sets.

3. While changing the number of rules it was found that there exists an optimal
number of rules after which the recognition error of the sample does not change.
4. The experiments with non-fuzzy RBF neural network had shown the best result
was obtained for training/test sample ratio 90–10, with an error of classiﬁcation
14.3%. The results of the fuzzy neural network proved to be much better than
the RBFN. Additionally, for NefClass FNN it is possible to change the number
of fuzzy sets and the number of rules.

State-of-Art Problem Analysis
In medical diagnostics problems substantial amount of problem constitute the features
extraction for further processing and the choice features classiﬁcation method. With
development and wide dissemination of decision-support systems the demands to
training algorithms are increasing. Reliability and simplicity of application inﬂuence
on speed and quality of decision-making which is very important for express medical
diagnostics. The advantages of medical diagnostics systems are speed, automation
and stability of work which make them very comfortable tools for express medical
diagnostics. Despite young age of medical informatics which don’t exceed 30 years
information technologies in a whole are fast penetrating in various spheres of med-
icine and health defence. (family medicine, insurance medicine, building uniﬁed
information space, integration in European medical space, etc.)
Nowadays, in practice, at every stage of diagnostics information technologies are
utilized. The main goal of medical automated systems are extension of spheres
practical tasks which may be solved with computers aid, raise of level intellectual
decision support of doctors in particularly in process of express diagnostics based
on processing and analysis of medical images of human tissue obtained by different
source (MRT, CT, etc).
Now cancer constitute the great problem for health defence all over the world.
Basing the on data of IARC (International Agency of Cancer Research) 8.2
million death cases were registered in year 2012, 27 million new cases of illness are
expected till 2030 [13]. Among the different types of cancer breast cancer takes the
second place by its occurrence in women. Besides, mortality of it very high as
compared with other cancer diseases [14].
Despite of progress which was achieved by diagnostics technologies ﬁnal
diagnosis of breast cancer including classiﬁcation of tumors and diagnosis still is
performed by pathologo-anatomists which use visual analysis of histological pat-
terns by microscope. The latest achievements in images processing technologies
and machine learning enable to construct systems of automatic detection and
3.6

diagnostics (CAD/CADx) that may help pathologo-anatomists to make true diagnosis
and accelerate his work. Classiﬁcation of images histopathology on different patterns
which corresponds to cancer and not-cancer states of tissue is often ﬁrst rank goal in
images analysis systems for automatic cancer diagnostics. The main problem in such
systems lies therein they deal with complex histopathologic patterns.
Up to date several models and methods were developed for breast cancer
detection using various machine learning algorithms. Using such methods and
technologies of AI as neuron networks and SVM accuracy of diagnostics from 76 to
94% was attained at data set with 92 images.
Zhang et al. [15] suggested cascade approach. At the ﬁrst cascade level the
classiﬁers reject easy cases (those which evidently don’t pass test) and the others are
transferred to the second level which uses more complex classiﬁcation system and
so on. This method was applied to data base of Israel technological Institute con-
sisting of 361 images and accuracy results was 97%.
The most of last papers refers to ﬁeld of breast cancer classiﬁcation oriented on
integer image [16–19]. But wide implementation of BIC and other forms of digital
pathology faces with such disturbances as high cost of implementation, insufﬁcient
productivity for huge amount of clinic procedures, interior technologic problems
non- solved regulator questions and opposition from pathologo-anatomists side. Till
now the most of works based on histologic breast cancer analysis were performed
on not large datasets. Some improvement presents data set with 7909 breast images
obtained from 82 patients [19]. In this research the authors estimated various texture
descriptors and various classiﬁers and carried out the experiments with accuracy
from 82 to 85%.
Based on results presented in [19] one can conclude that texture descriptors may
propose good solution for images processing. The alternative to this approach based
on application of texture descriptors is the application of CNN for medical images
processing and diagnostics, which is considered and developed in the present
research. It was shown that CNN is able to overcome the conventional texture
descriptors. Besides traditional approach to detection of features based on
descriptors demands much efforts and high level knowledge of experts and usually
is speciﬁc for every task that prevents its direct application for another similar tasks.
CNN, which ﬁrstly was developed by LeCun in [20] is widely applied now for
achievement high results in different images recognition problems, with microscope
and macroscope texture.
The set of experiments with data set BreaKHis presented in [19] testiﬁes that
CNN achieves better results than the best results which were attained by other
models which were trained using alternative approach based on texture scenarios.
But the best results may be attained by combining CNN with other models.
Therefore in our research we suggested to use CNN for feature detection in
medical images of breast tissue and developed hybrid CNN-FNN classiﬁcation
system in which CNN is utilized to extract informative features of images and FNN
NEFClass is applied for classiﬁcation of detected tumors on images in two classes:
benign and malicious ones.

The main goal of following section is the presentation and investigation of
algorithmic and software tools for fast analysis of breast tissue images, detection of
tumors and their classiﬁcation into classes: benign or malignant one. This will enable
to provide express analysis of images and raise the quality medical diagnostics
3.7.2
Data Set Description
Data set BreaKHis [19] contains microscope biopsies from benign and malign
tumors of breast. The images were obtained in clinic research since January 2014
till December 2014.
BreaKHis consists of 7909 clinically representative microscopic images of breast
tumors received from 82 patients with different scale augmentation (40, 100,
200, 400).
All patients during this period were investigated in R&D medical lab with
clinical conclusion of breast cancer were invited to take part in this investigation.
All data were anonymized. The patterns are generated of biopsy breast slides
colored with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The patterns are collected by surgery
biopsy prepared for histologic research and marked by pathologists anatomists of
R&D lab. The main goal was to preserve original structure of tissue and molecular
composition which allows to observe it with optical microscope. For investigation
all images were split into slides of size 3 mkm. The ﬁnal conclusion of each case
was made by experienced pathologists anatomists which was conﬁrmed by addi-
tional investigation such as immune histo-chemistry (IHC).
The microscope system Olympus BX-50 with augmentation 3.3 connected with
digital camera Samsung SCC- 131AN, is used for obtaining digitized images of breast
tissue. Images were obtained in 3-channels color space True color (24 bits value, 8 bits
color channels RGB) with magniﬁcation coefﬁcients 40, 100, 200, and 400.
In the Fig. 3.21, 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24 four images are presents with four mag-
niﬁcation coefﬁcients (a) 40, (b) 100, (c) 200 i (d) 400—obtained from one

Convolutional Neural Networks Brief Description
A CNN is a state-of-the-art method that has been largely utilized for image pro-
cessing. A CNN model has the ability to extract global features in a hierarchical
manner that ensures local connectivity as well as the weight-sharing property. It
consists of the following layers [20, 21].
• Convolutional Layer: The Convolutional layer is considered as the main
working ingredient in a CNN model and plays a vital determining part of this
model. A kernel (ﬁlter), which is basically an n  n matrix successively goes
through all the pixels and extracts the information from them.

• Stride and Padding: The number of pixels a kernel will move in a step is
determined by the stride size; conventionally, the size of the stride keeps to 1.
Figure 3.26a shows an input data matrix of size 5  5, which is scanned with a 3
 3 kernel. The light-green image shows the output with stride size 1, and the
green image represents the output with stride size 2. When we use a 3  3
kernel, and stride size 1, then the convolved output is a 3  3 matrix; however,
when we use stride size 2, the convolved output is 2  2. Interestingly, if we use
a 5  5 kernel on the above input matrix with stride 1, the output will be a 1  1
matrix. Thus, the size of the output image changes with both the size of the
stride and the size of the kernel. To overcome this issue, we can utilize extra
rows and columns at the end of the matrices that contain 0 s. This adding of
rows and columns that contain only zero values is known as zero padding.
For example, Fig. 3.26b shows how two extra rows have been added at the top
as well as the bottom of the original 5  5 matrix. Similarly, two extra columns
have been added at the beginning as well as the end of the original 5  5 matrix.
Now, the olive-green image of Fig. 3.26b shows a convolved image where we
have utilized a kernel of size 3  3, stride size 1 and padding size zero. The
convolved image is also a 5  5 matrix, which is the same as the original data
size. Thus, by adding the proper amount of zero padding, we can reduce the loss
of information that lies at the border.
• Nonlinear Performance: Each layer of the NN produces linear output, and by
deﬁnition adding two linear functions will also produce another linear output.
Due to the linear nature of the output, adding more NN layers will show the
same behavior as a single NN layer. To overcome this issue, a rectiﬁer function,
such as Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), Leaky ReLU, TanH, Sigmoid, etc., had
been introduced to make the output nonlinear.
• Pooling Operation: A CNN model produces a large amount of feature infor-
mation. To reduce the feature dimensionality, a down-sampling method named a
pooling operation has been performed. A few pooling operation methods are
well known such as
kernel = 3×3, stride=1,
kernel= 3×3, stride=2,
kKernel e 1,
kernel= 3×3, 
stride=1, 
Padding=2

– Max Pooling,
– Average Pooling.
For our analysis, we have utilized the Max Pooling operation that selects the
maximum values within a particular patch.
• Drop-Out: Due to the over training of the model, it shows very poor perfor-
mance on the test dataset, which is known as over-ﬁtting. These over-ﬁtting
issues have been controlled by removing some of the neurons from the network,
which is known as Drop-Out (it was considered in detail in the chapter 2).
Decision Layer: For the classiﬁcation decision, at the end of a CNN model, a
decision layer is introduced. Normally, a Softmax layer or a SVM layer is
introduced for this purpose. This layer contains a normalized exponential
function and calculates the loss function for the data classiﬁcation.
Figure 3.27 shows the work ﬂow of a generalized CNN model that can be used
for image classiﬁcation. Before the decision layer, there must be at least one
immediate dense layer available in a CNN model.
Utilizing the Softmax layer, the output of the end layer can be represented as
Yd ¼

where
Yend ¼ rðWend  Hend1 þ BendÞ:
Here, kend−1 represents the kth neuron at the (end −1)th layer, and r represents
the nonlinear function. For binary classiﬁcation, the number of classes is equal m =
2. Let d = 1 represent the Benign class and else it represents the Malignant class.

As we have a two-class classiﬁcation problem, then only the L1 and L2 values
are possible, and the output will be benign when L1 < L2, else the output will be
malignant.

CNN Model for Image Classiﬁcation
In the next Fig. 3.28 the architecture of VGG-16 is presented which was used in our
work as detector of informative features. It was trained by different algorithms:
stochastic gradient descent (SCD), basin hopping [22] and differential evolution.
As classiﬁer of obtained features in our research was suggested to use FNN Nef
Class.
In the next section results of classiﬁcation by suggested hybrid CNN-Nefclass
are presented and compared with results obtained by other researches which used as
classiﬁers SVM machine, Random forests and other classiﬁcation methods.
3.7.5
Experimental Investigations and Results Analysis
As it was already mentioned in our investigation pretrained CNN VGG 16 was
used. Method of training transfer was applied for this purpose. Training transfer
method as it goes from its name means the transfer of knowledge obtained during

training one CNN to another neural network applied for solution of similar or
connected problems.
There are two main training scenarios:
(1) Features extraction. In this case the last full-connected layer is deleted and the
rest part of CNN is used as extractor for new data sets.
(2) Fine tuning. In this case new data set is used for ﬁne training of previously
pretrained neural network.
In our research CNN VGG 16 was used for features extraction in medical images
of breast tumors. After that the detected features were fed as input data to FNN
NEFClass described in the previous section. As algorithms of training FNN three
algorithms were used: basin hopping [22], stochastic gradient descent and differ-
ential evolution.
The series of experiments were carried out and the results were compared with
works of predecessors [24]. In the following Tables 3.12 and 3.13 the results of
classiﬁcation with different parameters are presented. All sample was divided into
training and testing subsamples with ratio 80%/20%.
From this table on can readily see that beginning from 6 fuzzy sets per variable
and 6 rules the accuracy doesn’t increase but complexity of training raises.
As it follows from table for two classes the best values of parameters are 4 fuzzy
sets per variable and 6 rules. For comparison take the results of previous works
obtained with different classiﬁers for the same problem [23] (see Table 3.13).
In the ﬁrst experiment we varied the number of linguistic variables (terms) and
rules that to determine the best parameters values [24]. As we can see from the

Table 3.13 FNN NEFClass shows better results than previous classiﬁers: SVM
machine and Random forest [23].
In our work for training of FNN NEFClass were applied three algorithms,
namely, basin hopping, stochastic gradient descent and differential evolution. Using
algorithms basin hopping and stochastic gradient descent we obtained approxi-
mately equal results that may mean the true optimal results while the training results
of differential evolution appeared to be much worse.
It’s worth to note that in this problem the number of features extracted by CNN
VGG16 was very large—4096 features. Therefore it was decided to cut the number
of features. For this principal components method [25] was applied. In the
Table 3.14 the results of such reduction are presented.
From the Table 3.14 it follows that the results of reduction with 250 principal
components is most acceptable as the complexity of training increases approxi-
mately proportional to number of input data.
Due to lack of time the next experiments were performed using data with 100
magniﬁcence factor (2081 images). In the next Table 3.15 the accuracy of classi-
ﬁcation is presented with different parameters.
In the Table 3.16 the dependence of classiﬁcation accuracy versus number of
features is presented. one can see from this table that accuracy decreased only by
some percent due such features reduction. But by this reduction we substantially cut
the training time.

From this table one can readily see that the accuracy drops with decrease of
features number but insigniﬁcant by 3–5% if compare 100 and 250 features. For
comparison use the full set of features 4096 and we can see that with decrease
features number in 20 times the accuracy falls 2–3% in means.
This conclusion testify in favour of application of PCM method for reduction of
dimension of medical images classiﬁcation problems.

Intellectual Analysis of Systemic World
Conﬂicts and Global Forecast
for the 21st Century
4.1
Introduction
Data on global conﬂicts took place from 750 B.C. up to now are analyzed and their
general pattern is revealed. An attempt is made to foresee the next global conﬂict
called the conﬂict of the 21st century. Its nature and main characteristics are ana-
lyzed. Main global threats are listed, and their impact on ﬁve groups of countries is
determined using cluster analysis.
Based on the consideration of evolutionary development of the civilization as a
holistic process determined by a harmonious interaction of its components, patterns
of Kondratieff cycles of the development of the global economy and C-waves of
global systemic conﬂicts are compared and an attempt is made to predict these
processes in the 21st century using a metric approach.
The next part of the study is based on the Fibonacci pattern of global systemic
conﬂicts (Ñ-waves) which allowed us to formulate the hypotheses about a metric
relation between two global periodic processes, namely, between the sequence of
11-year cycles of solar activity and the process of evolutionary structurization of the
family of Ñ-waves of global systemic conﬂicts covering large and super-large time
intervals and having a variable structural conﬁguration.
The structural analysis is performed for Cn-waves of global systemic conﬂicts
based on their empirical sequence, and metric approaches are proposed to study and
forecast these processes. Global systemic conﬂicts and great Kondratieff waves of
the development of the world economy are proved to correspond to a number of
additional conditions, namely, to the modern concept on the acceleration of his-
torical time, to the law of structural harmony, and to global forecasts for the 21st
century.
Bayesian Belief Networks are used to establish qualitative causal relations
between global threats and indicators of sustainable development. The method of
belief network synthesis and a method of generalization of ﬁnal results are

proposed. This made it possible to obtain a holistic understanding of effects of
global threats on the sustainable development of countries and regions of the world.
The generalization and formalization of approaches to the recognition of
C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts using big historical data are performed and
general concept of description and interpretation of these waves is proposed.
Special attention is paid to the class of big C-waves, which cover super-long time
intervals. Their pattern is invariant to the evolution of the nature of global conﬂicts.
There has also been made an attempt to predict these processes in the 21st century
by using a metric approach. The possible scenarios of the development of the
conﬂict of the 21st century have been constructed and analyzed.

Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence
of Systemic World Conﬂicts, Based on the Analysis
of Big Historical Data
An analysis of the complete list of global conﬂicts [1] occurred since 2500 B.C. up
to now shows that, beginning with the 7th century B.C., these conﬂicts did not
follow any regular pattern, reminding a random process such as white noise.
Historic facts about constant conﬂicts at early stages of the development of human
civilization as a natural form of its existence conﬁrm this. A certain periodic pattern
can only be revealed in a series of global conﬂicts only after higher forms of society
organization appear. This periodic pattern was revealed and studied in [2]. With this
pattern, it becomes possible to foresee the next system conﬂict, to analyze the set of
threats giving rise to it, to determine the effect of these threats on its course, and to
construct scenarios of possible development of society during and after the conﬂict.
Pessimistic predictions are necessary from the scientiﬁc point of view to avoid
possible negative outcome, although naturally everyone would prefer to be wrong
in such predictions.

now with the following time quantization:
Dn ¼ 50years5years  n;
n ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .;
The number of global conﬂicts for each quantization interval Dn has been

4.2.2
Conﬂict of the 21st Century and Analysis of Its Nature
Let us consider the Top 12 global threats to the sustainable development to be those
determined in the beginning of the XXI century by such recognized international
organizations as United Nations Organization (UNO), World Health Organization
(WHO), World Economic Forum, Transparency International, Global Footprint
Network, International Energy Agency, World Resources Institute, British
Petroleum company and others. The analysis of every threat will give the possibility
to determine the vulnerability level of different countries of the world to the inﬂuence
of these aggregated threats. Let us analyze each of the 12 global threats separately.
Threat 1. Global Decrease in Energy Security (ES)
For the ﬁrst part of the XXI century one of the main critical challenges to the
mankind is the rapid decrease in organic fuel resources that are extracted from
entrails of the earth, and the increase in consumption of such resources, ﬁrst of all,
by large developing countries. In the beginning of the 30-ies of the current century,
the curves of energy consumption and production of energy from oil will be crossed
[3]. In other words, the “production-consumption” balance of energy, produced
from oil, will change its value from positive to negative. The similar phenomena
will occur for “production-consumption” balances of energy, made from gas in the
beginning of 40-ies and for the energy generated from uranium-235 in the 50-ies–
60-ies, accordingly (Fig. 4.3).
Fig. 4.3 Changes the balance “production–consumption” from positive to negative for energy,
produced from oil, gas, and uranium-235, accordingly
146

Intellectual Analysis of Systemic World Conﬂicts and Global …

Thus, until the mankind invents the energy resources that could fully replace the
organic types of fuel and nuclear energy, the energy security of a country in
particular and the world in general, will decrease. In order to quantitatively estimate
the energy security of different countries of the world let us introduce the energy
security index (Energy Security Index, ES) that will be calculated by the formula:
ESi ¼ Exhaustablesi þ Renewablesi

Renewablesi ¼

;
ð4:7Þ
where:
• ES 2 0;1
½
; {countries}—set of explored countries;
• Exhaustables is the component that characterizes the dynamics of resource
deﬂation;
• Renewables is the component that characterizes the volumes of usage of
renewable sources in national energetic;
• NuclearR, CoalR, OilR, GasR—resources of uranium-235, coal, oil and gas
(Nation Master, n.d.);
• Renewables Used—part of renewable energy produced and consumed by the
country (at the expense of use of the energy of water, sun, wind, geothermal heat,
biomass and rubbish burning) in percents from total energy consumption [4].
To evaluate the reduction in the reserves of organic fuel for various countries in
the subsequent simulation, we will use the index of “Consumption of traditional
fuels in percentage of the total energy needs of the country” [4].
Threat 2. The Imbalance Between Biological Capacity of the Earth and
Human Needs in Biosphere (FB)
In early 2018, the world’s population reached 7.6 billion people living on the total
area 510,072,000 km2. The daily growth of Earth population exceeds 162 thousand
people [5]. According to the method of arithmetic extrapolation the Earth popu-
lation will have been 9.75 billion people by the year 2050. That is why the ﬁrst
threat appears being related to the fact that the Earth will be inhabited by the
number of people that will exceed its abilities to sustain on the basis of the present
natural resources. The japanese experts believe that the real problems for the
mankind will be connected with the catastrophic shortage of water, energy, food-
stuff that can cause new conﬂicts on the Earth [6].
Nature can satisfy human requirements for business activity and only while this
activity remains within the biosphere renewable capacity on the populated part of
the planet. The calculation of ecologically disturbed area (Ecological Footprint) [5]
4.2
Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence …
147

gives the possibility to establish some limit according to which the ecological
requirements to the world economics are within or exceed the biosphere abilities
(Biocapacity) to supply the people with goods and services. This limit helps people,
organizations and government to create strategies, establish the goals and provide
the process according to the requirements of the sustainable development.
Ecologically disturbed territory (Ecological Footprint) determines which its part
is necessary to preserve present population according to the present level of con-
sumption, level of technological development and usage efﬁciency of natural
wealth. The unit of measurement of this dimension is average (global on the whole
Earth) hectare. The most substantial component of the Ecological Footprint is the
territory of the Earth used for foodstuff production, forest area, biofuel amount,
ocean (seas) territory, used for ﬁshing and the most important element is the Earth
area, necessary to support the life of plants absorbing the emissions of CO2 as a
result of organic fuel burning.
Ecological Footprint envisages that in world economy the people use resources
and ecological services from all over the world. Thus, the indicator for a country
may exceed its actual biological possibilities. On the basis of it, the essence of
Ecological Footprint for a country is the extent of its consumption and global
impact on environment.
The same methodology can be used for calculation (in the same values) of
biological abilities of the Earth, biological productivity of its territory. In 2017
biological abilities of the Earth were approximately 11.2 billion or 1.8 global
hectares per capita (non-human species were not considered). Now the human need
in biosphere, i.e. its global Ecological Footprint is 18.1 billion global hectares or 2.3
global hectares per capita. That is why, today global Ecological Footprint exceeds
biological abilities of the Earth by 0.5 global hectares per capita. This means that
vital resources of the planet disappear faster than the nature can renew (Fig. 4.4).
This threat has substantial correlation degree with demographic structure change
of the planet population. For example, according to Human Development Report
Fig. 4.4 Misbalances between biocapacity of the Earth and total consumption (ecological
footprint)
148

Intellectual Analysis of Systemic World Conﬂicts and Global …

2017 the biggest growth of population over a period of the following 50 years is
expected in the poorest regions of the world: in Africa it will increase in 2 times, In
Latin America and Caribbean basin will increase in 1.5 time, at the same time in
Europe it will decrease in 0.8 times [4]. Essential threat is also uncontrolled increase
in the urban population in underdeveloped countries. By the year 2050 it will have
been doubled approximating to 10 billion people. It will lead to intensiﬁcation of
transport, ecological and social problems, an increase in criminality and other
consequences of chaotic urbanization.
The important tendency of the nearest decades is rapid change in the structure of
religious groups of the Earth population. So, from 1980 to 2015 the number of
Muslins will increase from 16.5 to 30%, the number of Christians will decrease
from 33.3 to 31%, the number of Hindus will decrease from 13.3 to 10%, the
number of Buddhists will decrease from 6.3 to 5%. The number of representatives
of other religious groups will also decrease from 31.1 to 25% (Japan Vision 2050.
Principles of Strategic Science and Technology Policy Toward 2020. Science).
Science Council of Japan, 2005). These changes will cause the necessity of
searching new methods of tolerance coexistence of people on the Earth.
For estimation of increasing threats, connected with imbalance between biological
capability of the Earth and human requirements in biosphere, in terms of demographic
structure change of the world we will use the indicator which is ecological reserve
(“+”) or deﬁcit (“−”) in global hectares per capita for a country (Global Footprint
Network, http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/) [6].
Threat 3. Growing Inequality Between People and Countries on the Earth
(GINI)
According to the World Bank, the difference in proﬁts between the richest and poorest
countries was 44:1 in 1973 and is now 72:1. Three richest persons have a capital that
exceeds the property of 47 poor countries, 475 richest people hold a capital that
exceeds the property of half of the mankind. The ratio between one ﬁfth of the rich part
of the world population and one ﬁfth of the poorest population has achieved 1:75.
The beneﬁts of civilization remain unaccessible for the poorest group. Its rep-
resentatives live for less than two dollars per day. Seven hundred million of them
live in Asia, 400 million in Africa, and 150 million in Latin America. The difference
between the richest and poorest groups in the standard of living has increased
almost ten times over the last twenty years. The threat is rather hazardous from the
standpoint of increasing number of conﬂicts in the world, growth of corruption,
terrorism, and criminality, environmental degradation, impaired education and
medical service.
To asses quantitatively the disparity of the distribution of economic and social
beneﬁts for each of the countries under study, we will use the Gini index [7], which
reﬂects these characteristics.
Threat 4. The Spread of Global Diseases (GD)
The World Health Organization considers such diseases as cancer, cardio ischemia,
cerebrovascular disease (paralysis), chest troubles, diarrhea, AIDS, tuberculosis,
4.2
Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence …
149

malaria, diabetes to be the most dangerous for mankind as they may not only have
bad consequences but also globally spread all over the world [8].
During the next 20 years the sufﬁcient increase in mortality caused by all non-
infectious global diseases and decrease in mortality caused by AIDS, tuberculosis
and malaria are expected (Fig. 4.5). Such diseases as cardio ischemia, cere-
brovascular disease, lung cancer and diabetes will become main global diseases
during this period. At the same time the rate of total mortality from tobacco con-
sumption will increase from 5.8 million people in the year 2009 to 8.3 million in the
year 2030. Thus, tobacco is expected to kill by 50% people more than AIDS. Total
human mortality on the Earth will be by 10% predetermined by the tobacco
consumption.
According
to
the
UNAIDS
international
organization,
the
number
of
HIV-infected people on the Earth increased from 36.9 million in 2004 to 45 million
in 2015. This general tendency (with minor oscillations) is traced in all regions of
the world.
Despite the success in tuberculosis control, eight million new diseases occur
annually in the world, which cause two million lethal outcomes. In the countries
with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, the number of tuberculosis diseases has
increased 3–4 times over the last 15 years (www.who.int/gb), 80% of them in
Africa, South-East Asia, and western part of the Paciﬁc Ocean.
Malaria is traditionally most spread in Africa and Latin America. For the last ﬁve
years, morbidity has increased 2–3 times in Afghanistan, Ghana, Papua New
Guinea, Pakistan, and Uganda and 30 times in Mozambique and Democratic
Republic of the Congo; menacing rates of growth of morbidity (70 times increase)
are observed in Mali. In other countries where malaria is revealed, the number of
diseased changes within the limits of ±50% for the last ﬁve years.

The spread of global diseases (GD) is measured in the total number of people
(millions per year) who died from these diseases. For the subsequent simulation, we
take data on these diseases from the World Health Organization [8].
Threat 5. Information Gap (IG)
Information Gap is formed by two determinants of the modern information society:
1. Humanity is constantly generating gigantic volumes of new data and informa-
tion. Its total volume will reach 35 ZB by 2020 (1 ZB = 1021 B). At the same
time, mankind is capable of comprehending, systematizing, processing and
documenting signiﬁcantly smaller volumes of new data and information (until
2020, only 15 ZB). Thus, by 2020, up to 20 ZB will accumulate unthinkable and
unprocessed information, a sort of “Information black hole.” This information
uncertainty
explains
the
unpredictable
and
unconscious
phenomenon
(Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 as a result of the unpredictable earthquake and
tsunami, the disintegration process of the European Union in 2016 as a result of
the British referendum, and many others). This component of the Information
Gap will be measured using the ICT Development Index (IDI, http://www.itu.
int/net4/ITU-D/idi/2016/).
2. The vulnerability of one or another country, territory or world to the action of
cyber attacks. This component of the IG will be measured using the Global
Cybersecurity Index (GCI, http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/
GCI-2017.aspx).
Both IDI and GSI indexes are annually formed by International Telecommunication
Union. The resulting index of IG will be calculated from the formula:
IG ¼ 0:4 IDA þ 0:6 GCI
ð4:8Þ
Threat 6. Corruption Perception (CP)
Corruption is the biggest obstacle to the economic and social development of
society. It endangers every change. Corruption has become not only one of the main
reasons of poverty but also a source which prevents its overcoming. Although
corruption had existed for a long time it became more widely spread in the process
of globalization at the end of the 20th at the beginning of 21st centuries.
Corruption in one country had negative impact on the development of other
countries which means that countries with the high level of corruption are not limited
to the Third World. The process of liberalization in the former socialist countries was
accompanied by unprecedented position abuses in 90-ies. Thus, Financial Times
proclaimed 1995 to be “the year of corruption”. The following years were marked
with the spread of this phenomenon almost throughout all countries of the world and
corruption itself became of global and international character.
Wellbeing did not become the prerequisite of successful elimination of cor-
ruption. The analysis of long-term tendencies revealed by the international
organization «Transparency International» showed that during last 15 years the
4.2
Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence …
151

level of corruption has decreased in such countries as Estonia, Columbia, Bulgaria.
Nevertheless, the growth of corruption occurs in such developed countries as
Canada USA and Ireland. Such factors of risks as opacity of state authorities,
excessive inﬂuence of separate oligarchic groups, violation in ﬁnancing of political
parties, etc. exist both in poor and rich countries and unfortunately, tendencies in
increase of corruption scale are the same.
Usually, the structure of corruption is different in different countries of the world.
To estimate the inﬂuence of corruption on socio-economical and cultural
development of different countries of the world we will use “the Index of corruption
perception”
established
by
the
international
organization
“Transparency
International” [9] (https://www.transparency.org/country).
Threat 7. Limited Access to Drinking Water (WA)
According to the data of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UNICEF
[10] the world is under the threat of reduced the access to drinking (potable) water
and to sanitary facilities. The ﬁfth part of all mankind (1.4 billion people) does not
have access to drinking water and 2.4 billion of people do not have minimal
sanitary facilities. That is why 2003 was proclaimed as year of drinking water by
the General Assembly of UNO. The period of 2005–2015 starting from the
International Day of Water Recourses (22nd of March, 2005) was proclaimed as
International decade of actions “Water for life”.
An especially severe situation is observed in urban areas of underdeveloped
countries, where the fast growth of population aggravates promptly this problem.
The above-mentioned factors especially affect children’s health. By the estimates of
the World Health Organization, 1.6 million children under ﬁve annually died (on
the average, 4500 children daily) of using unsafe water and lack of proper hygiene.
As the world population grows, especially in underdeveloped countries, the struggle
for control of the resources of fresh water will aggravate, which is the next global
threat for mankind.
As the world’s population grows, especially in underdeveloped countries, the
struggle for control over the remnants of drinking water resources increases. This
phenomenon gives rise to the next, growing in time, threat to humanity.
The limited access to the drinking-water will be estimated by the inversed
magnitude to the indicator of the access to drinking water [10].
Threat 8. Global Warming [GW]
Global warming is the process of gradual increase in the average annual temper-
ature of the Earth and World Ocean. According to conclusions of the International
Expert Group in Climate Control (UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water
Supply and Sanitation, n.d.) and National Academies of Sciences of the Group of
Eight [11], from the end of 19th century the average temperature of the Earth has
risen by 1 °C and “the major part of warming observed during the last 50 years had
been caused by human activities” preliminary by gas emissions which cause
green-house effect (carbon dioxide, CO2) and methane (CH4).
152
4
Intellectual Analysis of Systemic World Conﬂicts and Global …

Estimates obtained with the climate models and cited by the International Expert
Group in Climate Control show that the average temperature of the Earth can
increase from one to several °C (in different regions of the world or in the Earth in
average) in 1990–2080 years. The warming is expected to cause other climate
changes such as an increase in the level of Word Ocean by 0.1–5 m. (probably, in
30–40 years), the appearance of new viruses and also the change of atmospheric
condensation and their distribution.
This may result in an increase in such natural disasters as ﬂoods, draughts,
hurricanes etc.; a decrease in harvests of agricultural crops, the emergence of new
epidemic diseases and the extinction of many biological species. As a result of the
control over decreasing natural resources the struggle not only between countries
but also between separate groups of population can exacerbate. This process will
cause new global conﬂicts.
It is necessary to accept that inﬂuence of carbon dioxide emissions on the global
warming is much higher than the corresponding inﬂuence of methane. That is why
the danger of global warming could be estimated by the amount of carbon dioxide
emissions CO2 in metric tons [5, 11].
Threat 9. The State Fragility [SF]
After the end of Cold War and Soviet Union collapse (1991) the world has entered
the era of new dramatic geopolitical processes. The following 18 years were
marked with the blistering growth of globalization. Technical revolution in the ﬁeld
of information-communication technologies has made the world policy more
transparent and led to an increase in changes inﬂuence which occurred in one region
and affected the other parts of the planet. Due to these new qualities of the glob-
alized world it became clear that new geopolitical system is full of unstable,
unsuccessful and weak countries. The weakening of retaining mechanisms peculiar
to bipolar world and conﬂict exacerbation between fundamental values of different
countries caused a new wave of oppositions, terrorism, violence, territorial claims
and irregular development.
Uncontrolled spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapon, rebuilding of
nuclear energetics in such unstable, unbalanced world signiﬁcantly increases the
threat for sustainable development and global security of mankind.
Under such conditions the stabilization of world development becomes possible
due to the international cooperation, investments and support to the weak countries
and planet regions by the progress of new paradigms of “harmonious coexistence”
or “tolerant, peaceful world”. In order to accomplish such global, stabilizing policy
the recognized international organizations and scientiﬁc centers began to develop
analytical instruments for the estimation of new developing tendencies of the world
since the beginning of this century. The ﬁrst attempt to control the tendencies of the
global development was a series of reports “The world and the conﬂict” which were
published in the University of Maryland State (USA) in 2001. Reports devoted to
the global tendencies of world development were also published in many countries
such as Spain, Canada, and Germany etc.
4.2
Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence …
153

The ﬁnal aim of the development of new analytical instruments was the attempt
to estimate the ability of different countries to act in such important dimensions as
conﬂict, state administration, economic and social development. Among all these
instruments “The index of ability of the peaceful society development” that belongs
to the series of reports “The world and conﬂict”, “Indicators of the world man-
agement” developed by the World Bank and “Index of unsuccessfulness of the
countries” developed by The Fund of Peace can be mentioned.
For the quantitative estimation of the sustainable development threat in our
research the Fragile States Index (FSI) produced by The Fund for Peace (FFP) is
used (http://ffp.statesindex.org).
This index is based on the twelve indicators that cover a wide range of state
failure risk elements such as extensive corruption and criminal behavior, inability to
collect taxes or otherwise draw on citizen support, large-scale involuntary dislo-
cation of the population, sharp economic decline, group-based inequality, institu-
tionalized persecution or discrimination, severe demographic pressures, brain drain,
and environmental decay. Data concerning these values are given in the paper [12].
Threat 10. Natural Disasters (ND)
Natural disasters are the threat which is not so directly dependent on the human
activity comparing to the other threats mentioned above. But, taking into account
the reports of the international organizations on climate changes (World Economic
Forum, 2010–2017) we cannot state that a human being is beside the point of the
dynamics of the natural disasters.
Experts of UNO and World Data Center for “Geoinformatics and Sustainable
Development” (http://wdc.org.ua/en) determined 6 major natural disasters (in the
order of danger decrease): draughts, ﬂoods, hurricanes, extreme temperatures,
earthquakes and tsunami (http://www.un.org/russian/ga/undp/).
Index is calculated as follows:
1. The summarized total of people suffered from the natural cataclysms in a year in
a country is calculated:
DisastersAffectedyear; state ¼ DroughtAffectedyear; state þ FloodAffectedyear; state
þ StormAffectedyear; state þ ExtremeTemperatureAffectedyear; state
þ EarthquakeAffectedyear; state þ TsunamiAffectedyear; state; 8year; state
ð4:9Þ
2. Then the summarized total of people affected Disasters Affected is divided by the
amount of population in the country and in the given year:

where M[.], s[.]—are approximate average and standard deviation values respec-

As consequences of the natural disasters usually make a long-term inﬂuence on
the country, gradually disappearing only with time, the ﬁnal value of vulnerability
index on the natural disasters will be deﬁned as Exponential Weighted Moving

For the quantitative estimation of the degree of vulnerability of the world
countries to the natural disasters the index of vulnerability to natural cataclysms was
developed. The data of the International Disasters Database (http://www.emdat.be/)
and the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (http://www.cred.be/)
of the World Health Organization are used for its calculation. The values of vul-
nerability index for the countries to the natural disasters during 1995–2017 were
calculated according to the given methodology.
Threat 11. Conﬂict Intensity (CI)
The next global threat is the accruing quantity of conﬂicts in the world, both in the
separate countries, and between the sovereign states and groups of such states. In
our research we will consider a conﬂicts between interstate, intrastate, substate, and
transstate ones. Whereas interstate conﬂicts only involve internationally recognized
state actors, intrastate conﬂicts involve both state actors and non-state actors.
Substate conﬂicts are carried out solely among non-state actors. Transstate conﬂicts
involve both state and non-state actors and meet the criteria of political conﬂict for
at least two sovereign states.
Considered conﬂicts we will characterise their intensity. We will distinguish ﬁve
levels of intensity of conﬂicts: dispute, non-violent crisis, violent crisis, limited war,
and war. To each of these levels we will appoint following quantity of points:
• dispute—1 point;
• non-violent crisis—2 points;
• violent crisis—3 points;
4.2
Identifying the Regularity of the Emergence …
155

• limited war—4 points;
• war—5 points.
The last three levels constitute the category of violent conﬂicts, in contrast to the
non-violent conﬂicts (dispute and non-violent crisis). Whereas a dispute is a
political conﬂict carried out without resorting to violence, in a non-violent crisis one
of the actors threatens to use violence. This includes violence against objects
without taking the risk to harm persons, the refusal of arms surrender, pointing
weapon systems against each other and sanctions.
Quantitative data about intensity of conﬂicts we will take from a global resource:
Heidelberg Institute for International Conﬂict Research (http://www.hiik.de/en/
konﬂiktbarometer/pdf/ConﬂictBarometer_2016.pdf) [4].
Threat 12. Proliferation (NI)
“Proliferation” is a global threat of the debarment of the nuclear war, terrorism, the
increasing of total number of weapons. It is a complex conception which is declared
by many states and certainly is the part of modern policy. The level of the threat is
opposite to value of Nonproliferation index deﬁnes degree of military nonprolif-
eration and covers four categories of policy:
Nonproliferation Index deﬁnes degree of military proliferation and covers four
categories of policy:
1. Demilitarization or disarmament;
2. Scientiﬁc Research;
3. State’s Development;
4. Level of Nonproliferation for Neighbor States.
Each of these categories is formed using one or two levels of indicators. These
indicators, as well as the methodology for calculating the Nonproliferation index,
have been developed by World Data Center for Geoinformatics and Sustainable
Development [4].
Nonproliferation index is presented in a hierarchy discrete model, which shows
the factors of direct or indirect inﬂuence. This index shows the level of nonpro-
liferation in terms of state’s possibility to adhere the nonproliferation concept in a
wide sense. Lets consider each of these categories of policy
The ﬁrst one is Disarmament. The importance of this category is underlined by
Albert Einstein words: “I do not know with what weapons World War III will be
fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” Therefore, it is
necessary to control the weapons usage and decrease the number of these. Also the
military expenditures could describe this category. This category is very speciﬁc, so
the hypothesis about indicators should be improved by the existence of data in open
sources or by indirect information. This category includes information about
nuclear and uranium production, because it is necessary to keep in mind the pos-
sibility of nuclear weapons creation.
It is necessary to deﬁne the inﬂuence of indicators to the disarmament. Taking
into consideration that it is a process, which have some changes in time, probably
156

the differential quotient is the best way to describe the changes. So for all
non-binary indicators we can use the formula:
I ¼ Indicatorcurrent period  Indicatorpreveous period
Dtime
:
Therefore, this formula shows the dynamic of each process.
It is necessary to mention that the ﬁnal algorithm of indicators chosen consists of
two stages: ﬁnding all possible variants and choosing the group of necessary
indicators by mathematical methods. In such a way we ignore the experts’ opinions
by the open information limitation. This algorithm also shares to other categories.
The second category is Scientiﬁc Research. It has three main directions:
Education, Science and Innovations:
• The education indicators describe the quality of education and the level of
knowledge through the ﬁnancing and the enrolment of students. Participation in
Olympiads can show the level of knowledge in comparison with other countries.
• The second direction is Science. It includes such indicators as Scientiﬁc and
technical journal articles, Researchers in R&D (per million people), Research
and development expenditure (% of GDP).
• The last direction—Innovations—includes indicators Patent applications, resi-
dents, High-technology exports (current US$). As a result, 9 indicators represent
the category Scientiﬁc Research.
The third category is State’s Development. This category includes the fol-
lowing indicators:
• Life expectancy at birth (years);
• Gross national income (GNI) per capita (PPP $);
• Inﬂation, GDP deﬂator (annual %);
• Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita);
• Sectorial structure of economy.
The last category is Level of Nonproliferation in Neighbor States. This
category shows the risk to be engaged into some other states activities. The ﬁrst
indicator of this group is a conﬂict barometer for neighboring states. This indicator
is calculated by Heidelberg Institute for International Conﬂict Research [4] and
published in annual reports. It is necessary to ﬁnd a quantitate measurement for
relations between countries. It is clear that if historically country has some conﬂicts
with neighbors, it restrains the nonproliferation. This indicator could be calculating
in such way: ﬁrst of all, it could be 0 or 1 for each state. And the total sum of the
values will represent the historical factor of relations. The time horizon must be
limited, for example, by the newest history (from XX century). It seems that this
indicator partly crosses with the previous one. But the conﬂict barometer should
describe only the current situation.

4.2.3
Modeling the Total Impact of the Aggregate of 12
Global Threats on Different Countries and Groups
of Countries
Let’s determine the vulnerability of different countries and groups of countries to
the impact of a set of 12 major threats (discussed in Sect. 4.2.2). Quantitative data
on each of the 12 threats will be obtained from the global databases speciﬁed in the
description of these threats in Sect. 4.2.2. To determine the groups of countries with
close values of vulnerabilities to the impact of the 12 main threats, we use the
hierarchical Ward’s algorithm of clustering [4]:
[http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/Data/Courses/CS632/1999/clustering/dbms.html].
Let’s associate each country j with a vector TrJ:
TrJ ¼ ðES; FB; GINI; GD; IG; CP; WA; GW; SF; ND; CI; NIÞ;
elements of which characterize the degree of manifestation of corresponding 12
threats (Sect. 4.2.2), presented in Table 4.3.
Most initial data on each threat (Table 4.3) are taken from the World Data
Center “Geoinformatics and a Sustainable Development” (http://wdc.org.ua/en) [4].
Considering the fact that all the measured data for components of vector TrJ are
presented in different units of measurement, they have different physical meaning
and vary in different ranges, they have been reduced to the normalized form, so that
they vary in the range (0, 1). In this case, the value 0 corresponds to the minimum
value of the threat, and the value 1 corresponds to the maximum of this threat.
Let’s do this normalization using the following method. If higher values of threat
Xi correspond to better state of this threat, the indicators values are logistically
normalized according to the formula:
Cnormðxi;jÞ ¼
1 þ e
axi;j
b

1
ð4:10Þ
where parameters a and b are calculated as an average value and a standard
deviation for the set of countries under analysis.
Otherwise, when the highest values of threat Xi correspond to worse state of
parameter, we use the value inverse to the one calculated by formula (4.23):
Cnormðxi;jÞ ¼ 1 
1 þ e
axi;j
b

1
ð4:11Þ
After this normalization we have vector

From Table 4.4 it follows that Cluster 1 includes the group of countries most
successful from the safety standpoint, for which the degree of remoteness from the
set of 12 global threats is the greatest in the sense of (4.12). And vice versa, Cluster
5 includes the countries most vulnerable in this respect. For these countries the
degree of remoteness from the set of 12 global threats is minimum.

As presented in Table 4.5, the common trait of the ten leaders is high Isec, and
low level of threats. E.g., the group leaders, Canada, Finland, and Australia, have
the best indicators among all the group countries. However, certain coefﬁcients
such as biodiversity balance (FB), energy security (ES) and global warming
(GW) are higher than average.
The G-7 countries are characterized by a high level of national security and
therefore a low vulnerability to the impact of 12 global threats (Table 4.6).
The BRICS group of countries (Table 4.7) are characterized by average level of
life security (except for South Africa) and high level of threats. Notably, China, the
Russian Federation, and India are characterized by very high global warming
(GW) coefﬁcients. Brazil, the group leader, has high level of vulnerability to natural
disasters (ND), and personal income inequality (GINI). The lowest security level is
characteristic of South Africa, where the average level of threats is the highest in the
group: notably vulnerability to global diseases (GD) and personal income inequality
(GINI).
Six countries from the Results of Cluster Analysis (Table 4.4) are characterized
by high level of conﬂicts intensity indicator, which is caused by armed conﬂicts in
the territories of such countries (Table 4.8).
In total, experts of the Heidelberg Institute for International Conﬂict Research
counted 226 violent conﬂicts in the world in 2016 [4], 18 of them were deﬁned as
wars and 20—as limited wars.
Wars:
– Sub-Saharan Africa: Nigeria (farmers—pastoralists); Nigeria, Cameroon,
Chad, Niger (Boko Haram); Somalia, Kenya (al-Shabaab); South Sudan
(inter-communal violence); South Sudan (SPLM/A-in-Opposition); Sudan
(Darfur); Sudan (SPLM/A-North/Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile).
– Middle East and Maghreb: Afghanistan (Taliban et al.); Syria, Iraq et al. (IS);
Libya (opposition); Syria (inter-opposition violence); Syria (opposition); Turkey
(PKK, TAK); Yemen, Saudi Arabia (al-Houthi); Yemen (AQAP, Ansar
al-Sharia).
– Asia and Oceania: Pakistan (Islamist militant groups).
– The Americas: Mexico (drug cartels).
– Europe: Ukraine (Donbas).
Limited wars:
– Sub-Saharan Africa: Central African Republic (Anti-Balaka—ex-Séléka); DR
Congo (ADF); DR Congo (Bantu—Batwa); DR Congo (Mayi-Mayi et al.); DR
Congo,
Rwanda
(FDLR);
Nigeria
(northerners—southerners);
Sudan
(inter-communal violence).
– Middle East and Maghreb: Egypt (Islamist groups/Sinai Peninsula); Turkey

Myanmar
(Rohingya);

Conclusions
1. Based on the intellectual analysis of big historical data pertaining to global
conﬂicts taking place from 705 B.C. till now, the regularity of their occurrence
is determined. It is shown that a sequence of life cycles of system world conﬂicts
is subordinate to the law of the Fibonacci series, and the intensity of these
conﬂicts, depending on a level of technological evolution of the society, builds
up under the hyperbolic law. By using the determined regularity we attempt to
foresee the upcoming world conﬂict, called “the conﬂict of XXI century”, and
analyze its nature and the principal characteristics-duration, main phases of its
ﬂow and intensity.
2. A set of 12 basic global threats that generate “the conﬂict of XXI” was
described. By using the cluster analysis we identify the impact of these threats
on different countries of the world and on large groups of countries (civiliza-
tions) united by the common culture features. Suppositions were made on
possible scenarios of the world development during “the conﬂict of XXI” and
after its termination.
4.3
Interrelation Between Periodic Processes in the Global
Economy and Systemic World Conﬂicts
One of the major challenges to modern science because of the prompt development
of the global economic crisis and aggravation of global conﬂicts is to draw up
scientiﬁcally justiﬁed “metric” express forecasts of the social development for near
and far future. The role of any scientiﬁc forecasts and predictions should not be
exaggerated since they are conventional and limited, especially in the cases where
the process being analyzed passes to the so-called “blow-up mode” [13]. However,
the reliability of any forecast considerably increases if it “resonates” with other
global or local tendencies, hypotheses, and patterns. In our study, such additional
patterns are:
• modern hypotheses that the historical time accelerates as scientiﬁc and tech-
nological progress develops [13];
• cyclical nature of economic development [14];
• the tendency to reduce the duration of economic cycles as scientiﬁc and tech-
nological progress develops [15, 16].

The most signiﬁcant are four types of economic cycles [14]:
• the Kitchin inventory cycle of 3–5 years;
• the Juglar ﬁxed-investment cycle of 7–11 years;
• the Kuznets infrastructural investment cycle of 15–25 years;
• the Kondratiev wave or long technological cycle of 45–60 years.
In our study, we consider Kondratiev’s economic cycles as the most funda-
mental, characterizing not only economic, but also social and political processes in
society.
Proceeding from the above facts and considering the evolutionary development
of the civilization as a holistic process, which is determined by a harmonious
interaction of its components, we will compare the patterns of Kondratieff cycles of
the development of global economy and identiﬁed in Sect. 4.2 Cn-waves of global
systemic conﬂicts and will make an attempt to predict the course of periodic pro-
cesses in the 21st century.
4.3.1
Periodicity of Global Systemic Conﬂicts and Economic
Processes
In the previous section (Sect. 4.2), the Fibonacci pattern of the course of systemic
world conﬂicts was revealed (Table 4.1), presented in terms of the duration of these
conﬂicts T Cn
ð
Þ(4.1–4.4) and their intensity I Cn
ð
Þ (4.5–4.6).
As mentioned above, the property of a cyclical change of the economy is
reﬂected by Kondratieff cycles (K-cycles) discovered by an outstanding Russian
economist Nikolai Kondratiev 80 years ago [14, 15]. During the last two centuries,
such cycles with 40–60-year periods (Table 4.9) fully complied with the actual
development of economy. Figure 4.7 illustrates the course of K-cycles that cover
the time interval from the ﬁrst half of the last century to the present time.
Analyzing these cycles reveals that the major depression (in the USA) during the
downwave of the third K-cycle is illustrative for the last century; it has begun at the
end of the 1920s, developed into the default of dollar in 1933, and has essentially

rearranged the world structure as a result of the Second World War. The next long
crisis of the global economy, which is on the downwave of the fourth K-cycle, began
at the end of the 1960s–the early 1970s, developed into the default of dollar in 1971,
oil crisis in 1973–1975, passed to the deep economic crisis called stagﬂation, and
resulted in the mid-1980s–the early 1990s in the disintegration of the Soviet Union,
reconﬁguration of the world, and its transition to a unipolar world model.
Of great importance are Kondratieff’s conclusions (conﬁrmed by the analysis of
historical evidence) that the periods of upwaves of Kondratieff cycles are usually
accompanied by more serious social disruptions (revolutions, wars, etc.) than the
periods of downwaves [14, 15]. Hence, Kondratieff cycles characterize not only
economic but also socio-political dynamics.
An analysis of these phenomena reveals an interrelation between two cyclic
processes, development of the global economy and the occurrence and course of
global systemic conﬂicts. Nowadays, the mankind is on the border of the transition
from the downwave of the ﬁfth Kondratieff cycle to the rising wave of the sixth
K-cycle. This state corresponds to the transition from the global economic crisis to
the next economic upswing.
4.3.2
Analysis of the Relationship Between Systemic World
Conﬂicts and the Global Economy
Despite numerous attempts to establish a law governing the cyclic processes, none
pattern of the varying duration of full K-cycles in time has been scientiﬁcally
substantiated, which complicates drawing up efﬁcient “metric” forecasts of social
development for the near and far future. As a rule, all the studies addressed the
internal nature of Kondratieff cycles. For example, the hypothesis is well known
that the duration of K-cycles reduces with the scientiﬁc and technological progress
[17, 18].
Fig. 4.7 Long-term Kondratieff cycles in the 20th–early 21st century

Intellectual Analysis of Systemic World Conﬂicts and Global …

Kondratieff and his disciples emphasized that the patterns in the cyclic dynamics
of the economy and society are basically probabilistic. For different parameters (as
well as countries and regions), K-cycles are more or less pronounced. The results of
the analysis of long-term waves depend on the metrics and system of indicators
underlying the global historical pulsations and trends.
In this section we propose a new approach to revealing the patterns of time
variation in the duration of full K-cycles that synchronizes the development of
K-cycles with an external “metric” process, namely, with the course of global
systemic conﬂicts [16].
Basic Assumption. Let us formulate an assumption to be used in what follows:
there is one more downwave in the Kondratieff cycle that lasts about 28–30 years
(1750/55–1779/85) and precedes the ﬁrst upwave (1779/85–1810/17) identiﬁed by
Kondratieff [14, 15].
Such an assumption can be substantiated by a number of objective statements;
we will mention the most important ones.
First, the statement that such a wave (if exists) falls and lasts about 28 years
agrees well with the fact that the next wave accrues with approximately the same
duration, i.e., there is metric conformity in the sequence of down- and upwaves.
Second, as a distinguished Austrian-American scientist J. Schumpeter asserted,
there is a set of Kondratieff cycles. Schumpeter’s conclusions were based on his
“innovation theory of business” [19], which he used as late as in the 1930s to
develop a “Kondratieff cyclic paradigm” and innovation concept of “long waves.”
Third, Kondratieff waves should not be considered just as a form of cyclic
economic dynamics. They are a kind of historical cycles that cover the structure of
the whole society. It is in this aspect that Braudel [20], a well-known historian of
the 20th century, considered Kondratieff cycles and related them with the historical
tendency of the society and dated appearing of such cycles several centuries back: If
we associate two processes, the century tendency and Kondratieff cycles, we can
hear “music” of long-term conjuncture that sounds in two voices.
In contrast to the conventional point of view, the cycles Kondratieff speaks about
appeared on the European theater not in 1779 but several centuries earlier. Adding
the movements to the rise or downfall of the century tendency, Kondratieff cycles
strengthened or softened it [20].
Modiﬁed Sequence of Kondratieff Cycles. Let us consider the main assump-
tion. We will generate a new sequence of Kondratieff cycles
Kn

gn 
 1 (Table 4.6)
based on the conventional chronology [15–18]. In what follows, we will call the
sequence

gn 
 1 a modiﬁed sequence of Kondratieff cycles (MSKC).
Note that while each term of the conventional sequence

Since the sequence of C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts (see Table 4.1) and
the modiﬁed sequence of K-cycles of development of global economy (see
Table 4.10) are considered as interdependent components of the holistic process of
development of global society, let us overlap the curves of these processes on a
uniﬁed time scale from 1750 to 2008 (Fig. 4.8). Note that waves of global conﬂicts
Cn are actually joined together (see by Table 4.1) during some time, and speciﬁc
Fig. 4.8 Modiﬁed Sequence of K-cycles {Kn}n 
 1 joined with C5-wave on the interval 1750–
1920 (a), and with C6-wave on the interval 1920–2008 (b)

dates of joining waves C4 and C5 (1750); C5 and C6 (1920); C6 and C7 (2008) are
determined as some averaged instants of time.
Analyzing the result of overlapping these two processes on the common time
axis reveals a pattern; we will formulate it as the following principles.
1. Quantization Principle. The time intervals Tk D Cn

end, let us formulate the following hypothesis.
Main Hypothesis. Since development of the global economy and the course of
global systemic conﬂicts are interdependent components of the same process of
evolutionary development of a globalized society, the coordination of these pro-
cesses on the time intervals Tk D C5

Þ
ð
Þ and Tk D C6
ð
Þ
ð
Þ as to obeying the quanti-
zation and monotonicity principles holds true also on the time interval Tk D C7
ð
Þ

Þ.
Based on the main hypothesis, we can predict the course (in a metric sense) of
K-cycles in the 21st century, namely:
a. the time interval Tk D C7

ð
Þ contains no less than two full MSKC cycles

shorter than Tk D C6

Hence, two cases that correspond to two scenarios of Kondratieff cycles in the
21st century are possible.
Scenario A. The time interval 2008–2092 contains two full Kondratieff cycles
(Fig. 4.9a). In this case,

The main conﬁrmation of the validity of the scenario A is the commonly
assumed average duration of one full K-cycle varying from 40 to 60 years [15, 16].
However, more powerful arguments can be given in favor of the scenario B.
First, obeying the monotonicity principle is rather conventional for the scenario
A since Tk D C7
ð

ð

Þ

approximately equal because of the errors of time “joints” of the processes on the
time interval from 1750 to 2092.
Second, results of some modern studies of global evolutionary processes (such
as the concept about the acceleration of historical time [21] and the hypothesis that
the duration of Kondratieff cycles tends to reduce with the scientiﬁc and techno-
logical progress [17, 18]) may indirectly conﬁrm the priority of the scenario B.
If the scenario B takes place, then most probably the durations T K6

Þ, additional integrated studies are necessary that would
take into account the dynamics of various components of the global evolution of the
civilization such as the following key ones: prompt depletion of power resources of
the Earth, varied demographic structure of the world, growing social inequality
among people and countries, global climate changes, natural disasters, etc. It is
important to establish a relationship between the time quantum k c of the life of C-

This yields Fibonacci dependence of the duration of life of all waves Cn on the

Finally, the above pattern conﬁrms the hypothesis that the duration of Kondratieff

Conclusions
1. Based on the evolutionary development of the civilization as a holistic process
determined by a harmonious interaction of its components, we have compared
the patterns of a sequence of Kondratieff cycles of development of global
economy and of C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts and have made an attempt
to predict the course of these interconnected processes in the 21st century with
the use of a metric approach.
2. The results of the analysis allow concluding that the 21st century will most
probably manifest three K-cycles with the average duration of one full cycle of
about 30 years, which is much shorter than the average duration of one of the
previous ﬁve Kondratieff cycles (50 years). This may be because of the
technological progress and the new technological pattern being formed, which
cannot be investigated yet at the present stage of the development of the
mankind.
3. The interrelation has been revealed and Fibonacci dependence has been estab-
lished for the time quantum kc of the life cycles of C-waves of global systemic
conﬂicts and average duration of one full cycle of the modiﬁed sequence of
Kondratieff cycles on the time interval from 1750 to 2092.
4. The results of the study conﬁrm the reﬁned hypothesis that the duration of
Kondratieff cycles tend to reduce with the scientiﬁc and technological progress
[17, 18]. The revealed synchronization of the development of the global
economy and the course of global systemic conﬂicts can be interpreted as
indirect conﬁrmation of the adequacy of the models of Kondratieff cycles [15,
16] and C-waves [2].

Metric Aspects of Periodic Processes in Economy
and Society
The interrelation and principles of the development of various processes in the
nature and society are discussed in many publications [19, 22]. The paper [2]
reveals the pattern of global system conﬂicts based on the dynamic model of
so-called C-waves with the underlying metrics of golden section. The paper [20]
compares the principles of the sequence of great Kondratieff cycles of the devel-
opment of the global economy and C-waves of global system conﬂicts. An attempt
is made to predict these periodic processes for the XXIst century.
The principles revealed for global system conﬂicts and great Kondratieff cycles
become much more reliable if they correspond to some additional external condi-
tions (concepts, principles, hypotheses) and the conclusions made on their basis are
coordinated or “resonate” with the conclusions of other independent studies.
We will consider the evolution of the civilization as a holistic process that results
from the harmonic interaction of its components and substantiate the conformity of
the principles revealed in [2] to some additional conditions, namely:
• law of structural harmony [21];
• modern concept on the acceleration of historical time [23, 24];
• concept of great Kondratieff cycles [15, 16];
• global forecasts for the XXIst century [15, 17, 18, 22, 25–28].
By studying the empirical sequence of the periodicity of global conﬂicts, we will
perform the structural analysis of Cn-waves n ¼ 1; 6

	
identiﬁed in [2] and propose
metric approaches to the analysis and prediction of some global civilization
processes.

conclusions obtained on its basis coincide or “resonate” with conclusions of other
independent studies. Therefore, we will discuss the conclusions of some indepen-
dent studies that conﬁrm the reliability of the F-pattern.
The ﬁrst argument: the golden section present in the structure of C-waves.
Indeed, according to the structural harmony law [21], in any self-organizing system,
each operation mode varying according to the variations in structural states of the
system is related to a special time scale. This time scale is associated with a certain
invariant of the generalized golden section as a characteristic of the stationary state
of the system.
The second argument: as an integral part of the holistic evolutionary devel-
opment of the civilization, the universal effect of the acceleration of historical time
[23, 24] is manifested in the F-pattern since the duration of the lifecycles of C-
waves of global system conﬂicts successively decreases.
The third argument is based on the prognostic properties of the F-pattern. As
follows from Table 4.7, the Fibonacci sequence { FS } degenerates for Cn-waves
for n [ 6.
Whence the natural question arises: what will happen to the civilization after
2092, in particular, in the XXIInd century? Probably, the ﬁnal cycle of an evolu-
tionary chain will begin:
C1 [ C2 [ C3 [ C4 [ C5 [ C6 [ C7?
This question was answered by Vernadsky [22] and Moiseev [25], outstanding
scientists of the last century. They independently proposed the idea that if mankind
does not cardinally change its global behavior, the environment in the middle of the
XXIst century will degrade to the point that mankind will cease to exist. These
conclusions were made for the constant paradigm of mankind existence—
self-serving. If mankind changes the global existence paradigm to, for example,
harmonious coexistence on the Earth, then it will continue the mission on the planet
and the pattern of global conﬂicts revealed for the previous paradigm, which cor-
responds to the Fibonacci sequence, will no longer be valid for the new paradigm.
Thus, according to the forecast which is based on the F-pattern, the XXIst
century is an especial, critical phase of the evolution of our civilization. Moreover,
the proposed model allows not only making general conceptual conclusions but
also predicting and evaluating the metric characteristics of the possible stages of the
evolutionary development of the civilization in the XXIst century.
The fourth argument is based on the synchronism of two periodic processes:
C-waves of global system conﬂicts and K-cycles of the development of the global
economy, which are interdependent components of the uniﬁed holistic development
of the global society. The fundamental property of the global society is cyclic
development of its economy. This property is manifested by great Kondratieff
cycles (K-cycles) discovered 80 years ago by Nikolai Kondratieff (Kondratiev), an
outstanding Russian economist [15, 16]. Within the last two centuries, such cycles
with periods of 40–60 years were in complete agreement with the real development
of the economy.

The paper [20] interrelates the pattern of global system conﬂicts and the
development of the global economy. Overlapping these two processes on the
common time axis in [20] reveals their synchronism, which can be formulated as
the following two principles:
• Quantization Principle. The time intervals D Cn
ð
Þ; n 
 5 on which the
wave Cn undergoes the ﬁve phases of evolution: (ORIGIN) >(GROWTH) >
(CULMINATION) > (DECREASE) > (DECAY), contain an integer number
nk D Cn
ð
Þ
ð
Þ of complete K-cycles;
• Monotonicity Principle. The average duration Tk D Cn
ð
Þ
ð
Þ of one complete
K-cycle on the time intervals D Cn
ð
Þ substantially decreases as n grows.
4.4.4
F-Principle as the Basis of a Metric Study of Global
Civilization Processes
As the global economic crisis promptly expands and global conﬂicts sharply
aggravate, quick “metric” forecasts become of special value. As the results of [20]
show, the F-pattern may be an important aspect in the development of a scientif-
ically proved toolkit and methodology for the analysis of global civilization
processes.
Since the development of the global economy and the course of global system
conﬂicts are interdependent components of the evolutionary development of a
globalized society, we may assume that the synchronism of these processes on the
time intervals D C5
ð
Þ and D C6
ð
Þ as to obeying the quantization and monotonicity
principles holds true also on the time interval D C7
ð
Þ This yields, in particular, the
Fibonacci-dependence of the duration of the lifecycles of C-waves of global system
conﬂicts on the average duration of great Kondratieff cycles from 1750 to 2092.
As shown in [20], two scenarios for great Kondratieff cycles are possible in the
21st century:
• Scenario A. The period from 2008 to 2092 includes two complete Kondratieff
cycles, 43.5 years on average each;
• Scenario B. The period from 2008 to 2092 includes three complete Kondratieff
cycles, 28.3 years on average each.
More telling arguments can be brought in favor of scenario B. This can be
conﬁrmed indirectly by the results of some modern studies of global evolution
processes, of which noteworthy are the concept of acceleration of historical time
[23] and the hypothesis that the duration of great K-cycles tends to reduce with
scientiﬁc and technical progress [17, 18].

Conclusions
1. Based on the evolutionary development of the civilization considered as a
holistic process with harmonious interaction of its various components, it has
been justiﬁed that the F-pattern corresponds to a number of additional condi-
tions, namely:
• the law of structural harmony;
• the modern concept of acceleration of historical time;
• the concept of great Kondratieff cycles;
• global forecasts for the XXIst century as an especial, critical phase of the
development of the civilization.
2. As a result of the structural analysis of the time-base sweep of the WC-
sequences on the time interval D 750; Nowday
ð
Þ, all the metric characteristics
of Cn-waves, n ¼ 1; 6 have been established.
3. A new feature of the dynamics of Cn-waves of global system conﬂicts has been
revealed, namely, the strict hierarchy of Cn-waves with respect to the intensities
of their phases.
4. The metric forecast of the manifestation of great Kondratieff cycles in the 21st
century based on the F-pattern has been considered as an example.
4.5
Big Solar Spiral of Stirring up Global Systemic
Conﬂicts
In Sect. 4.2 and in paper [2], an analysis of the hypothetical Fibonacci pattern of
global systemic conﬂicts is made, based on the dynamic model of so-called
C-waves with the golden ratio metrics underneath. The studies [20, 29] consider the
evolutionary development of the civilization as an integral process formed as a
result of harmonic interference of its various components and justify the corre-
spondence of this pattern to a number of additional conditions, namely:
– existence of an interrelation of global systemic conﬂicts and Kondratiev cycles
of economic conjuncture (Sect. 4.3), [20];
– the law of structural harmony [15, 21];
– modern concept on the acceleration of historical time [23];
– global forecasts for the XXIst century as a special critical phase of the devel-
opment of civilization [30].
Based on the analysis of the empirical sequence of the frequencies of global
conﬂicts, structural analysis of C-waves was carried out and metric approaches to
the analysis and forecasting of some global civilizational processes were consid-
ered. Note that throughout centuries, according to the synchronous development of
194

the civilization, the nature of global conﬂicts also varied. It became especially
noticeable at the end of the XXth and in the ﬁrst decades of the XXIst centuries,
when the mankind passed to the “information society” where the terms such as
information wars, cyber wars, hybrid wars, psychotropic weapon, etc. have already
become customary.
However, the results mentioned above were grounded on the investigation of
only “inner” factors of civilizational processes, where a human being with his
mentality, complicated inner world, culture, and values remains the subject of all
conﬂicts. The manifestation of any global conﬂict was related, ﬁrst of all, to release
of an enormous “mental” and “social” energy accumulated by people. But it is
lawful to raise the question: Whether there are external (for a person) factors
inﬂuencing the behavior of civilizational processes and, in particular, patterns of
global systemic conﬂicts? To discuss this topic, let us turn to some authorities.
As far back as in the last century, A. L. Chizhevskii, an outstanding biophysicist,
one of the founders of space natural science, used a huge amount of factual material
and justiﬁed that the life of the biosphere and social rhythms depend on the rhythms
of the Sun and Space [31]. He had formulated the following postulates [32]:
• solar and space cycles in arithmetic mean are determined by the quantity
approximately equal to 11 years, and there are grounds to suppose that physical
factors calling this periodicity are periodically appearing sunspots, geomagnetic
storms, and other manifestations of solar magnetic activity substantially
inﬂuencing the life of the biosphere;
• modiﬁcation of social rhythms on the Earth’s surface (peak and decay phases
with respect to birth and death rates, illness, social manifestations, etc.), coin-
ciding in time with solar and space cycles, allow us to suppose that the reason of
this pattern can also be out of social factor;
• the reason of the strict periodicity of solar rhythms in all historical epochs can be
a physical factor inﬂuencing more or less uniformly all the population of our
planet;
• solar activity itself does not generate social bursts in literal sense (wars, revo-
lutions, etc.) and only promotes the accumulation of enormous “collective,”
“mental,” and “social” energy on the Earth, which then leads to its release.
In this context, one of the major tasks of modern science is to reveal the
spectrum of patterns of the operation of interrelated system “the Sun–the Earth” for
a fuller understanding of civilizational processes and to implement the corre-
sponding set of measures to prepare the mankind for future (predictable) global
events and to mitigate the expected adverse consequences.
In [31, 32] assumptions are made about the concentration of local conﬂicts near
the maxima of solar activity; however, publications on the inﬂuence of solar activity
on global conﬂicts with unstable “time conﬁguration” and considerable duration are
virtually absent. The supercomplexity of such problems is obvious.
In the present section, based on the Fibonacci pattern of global systemic conﬂicts
(Sects. 4.2 and 4.3), [2, 20, 29], we will formulate the hypotheses about a metric

relationship between two global periodic processes: the sequence of 11-year cycles
of solar activity and evolutionary structurization of the family of C-waves of global
systemic conﬂicts enveloping large and super-large time intervals and having a
variable structural conﬁguration.
4.5.1
Synchronous Variation of Solar Activity
and Formation of C-Waves of Global Systemic
Conﬂicts
The 11-year cycle of solar activity with average 11.1 year duration is deﬁned by the
Schwabe–Wolf [33] law. For the quantitative determination of solar activity, the
Wolf numbers averaged over a year [33] published by the Zurich observatory since
1849 are most often applied. A number according to the Zurich indexing is assigned
to all the observed 11-year cycles of solar activity. Number one is assigned to the
cycle began in 1755, and the number of the current cycle began in 2008–2009 is 24.
All the observations of solar spots are summarized and monthly average and
annual average values of the Wolf numbers are determined at the Solar Inﬂuences
Data Analysis Center (Belgium) [34].
An important statistical dependence of a series of Wolf numbers is characterized
by the relation of amplitude and phase of cycles. According to this rule, the larger
the duration of the current cycle, the less the amplitude of the next cycle [28]. Solar
cycle is asymmetric with respect to the maximum of solar activity: growth phase
(4.6 years) is shorter than decay phase (6.5 years) [33].
Table 4.13 shows the list of 11-year cycles of solar activity recorded since 1755
[28, 35, 36]. The graphic illustration of Zurich cycles Nos. 1–23 and of their
parameters is presented in Fig. 4.13 by a radar chart, where s k

is called the Schwabe–Wolf solar metric (the Schwabe–Wolf metric). Note that this
metric, as a stable external performance criterion of various global dynamic pro-
cesses in the interrelated system “the Sun–the Earth” allows us to improve some
metric parameters of these processes.
In particular, parameters of Ck-waves can be adjusted proceeding from the fol-
lowing facts:
• on the basis of scientiﬁc observations for the last three centuries, the number of
11.1 years is found as a stable arithmetic mean value of Schwabe–Wolf cycle
periods;
• considerable lengths of periods TðCkÞ of ðCkÞ-waves, k 2 I 1; 4

systemic conﬂicts (260 years < TðCkÞ < 1200 years) [2, 20, 29] allows us to

Figures 4.19 and 4.20 show two possible scenarios “XXI–2K” and “XXI–3K”
of the developments of global civilizational processes in the XXIst century. Taking
into account the patterns presented above and leaning upon the results from [2, 20,
29], we present the results of the metric scenario analysis in Tables 4.15 and 4.16.

notation A  B means that points A and B are rather close on the numerical axis; t
(O), t(G) and t(U) are conventional instants of time since which (according to
scientiﬁc forecast) the amount of oil, gas, and uranium consumed in the world,
respectively, will exceed their production.
We will assume that the scenario XXI-3K is more likely in the 21st century
compared to the scenario XXI-2K. In favor of this assumption, we give two
arguments:
1. According to the hypothesis of the acceleration of historical time [21], all
processes in the 21st century will proceed faster than in previous centuries.
2. Changes in the modern world are no longer linear in time (Fig. 4.21a). As
deﬁned by the UN Summit on Sustainable Development of 2015 and Davos
Summit of 2015, these changes are exponential (Fig. 4.21b), and the new digital
world is accordingly called exponential, where a, b and k are the constants of a
global society growth.

particular, as one more proof of the F-pattern of civilizational processes, leaning
upon the global external criterion.

2. Within the framework of the formulated hypotheses, we have obtained the
formula relating the main metric performances of three global periodic processes
of the Schwabe–Wolf cycles of solar activity, C-waves of global systemic
conﬂicts, and Kondratiev cycles of the development of the global economy.
3. We have constructed the big and hyperbolic “Solar spirals” of the process of
“stirring up” of the family of waves of global systemic conﬂicts by the sequence
of ensembles of Schwabe–Wolf cycles on the time interval from 840 BC till
2097 AD, as a visual illustration of the revealed patterns.
4. We have considered the formation of the local conﬁguration of a separate Ck-
wave of global systemic conﬂicts deﬁned by the inner hierarchy of the inten-
sities of its evolution phases. We have presented current parameters for the new,
24th, Schwabe–Wolf Zurich solar cycle “stirring up” the ﬁrst phase (“Origin”)
of the predicted C7-wave. We have emphasized years 2013 and 2014 as years of
active Sun.
5. We have constructed two possible scenarios, XXI–2K and XXI–3K, for the
development of global civilizational processes during the seventh (ﬁnal) sys-
temic global conﬂict in the 21st century. We have used the revealed patterns to
formulate the main characteristic features of the scenarios and to deﬁne their
metric performances.

Inﬂuence of Global Threats on the Sustainable
Development of Countries and Regions of the World
The study presented in this section is based on the concept of “sustainable devel-
opment” being the further development of studies of Vernadskij about noosphere
[22]. It has been theoretically and practically proved that on the edge of the cen-
turies studies about the noosphere appeared to be a necessary platform for the
development of three-dimension concept of ecological, social and economic sus-
tainable development [4].
Economic approach is based on the optimal usage of limited resources and
application of natural-, power- and material saving technologies for creation of the
gross income ﬂow which would at least provide the preservation (not reduction) of
the gross capital (physical, natural or human), with the use of which the gross
income is created.
From the ecological point of view the sustainable development is aimed at
provision of the integrity of both biological and physical natural systems as well as
their viability that inﬂuences the global stability of the whole biosphere. The ability
of such systems to renovate and adapt to the various changes instead of mainte-
nance of the biological variety in the certain static state, its degradation and loss is
becoming extremely important.
Social constituent is aimed at human development, the preservation of stability
of social and cultural systems, as well as the decrease in the number of conﬂicts in
the society. A human being shall become not the object but the subject of the
development participating in the processes of his/her vital activity formation,
decision-making and implementation of the decisions, in the control over their
implementation. To meet such requirements it is important to fairly distribute the
wealth between the people, to observe pluralism of thoughts and tolerate human
relationships, to preserve cultural capital and its variety, including ﬁrst of all, the
heritage of non-dominant cultures.
Systemic coordination and balance of these three components is an extremely
difﬁcult task. In particular, the interconnection of social and ecological constituents
causes the necessity to preserve equal rights of present and future generations to use
natural resources. The interaction of social and economic constituents requires the
achievement of equal and fair distribution of material wealth between people and
help provision to the poor. And ﬁnally, the correlation of environmental and eco-
nomic components requires the cost estimation of anthropogenic inﬂuences on
environment.
In this study a Sustainable Development Gauging Matrix (SDGM) [4] within
three abovementioned components is proposed and these processes are globally
modeled in terms of quality and security of the human life. With the help of this
Matrix the sustainable development processes have been globally modeled for a
large group of world countries in terms of quality and security of the human life.
The present article is a development of investigations that are presented in [38, 39]
and describe the theoretical substantiation and computer modeling of the inﬂuence
210

of system global conﬂicts on the sustainable development of countries and regions
of the world in the global context. A distinctive feature of the investigations pre-
sented in these works lies in the analysis of linear dependences between values of
levels of separate threats and integrated quality and safety indicators of life of
people.
Also in this section is analyzed the inﬂuence of 12 global threats on the sus-
tainable development at the qualitative level with the use of Bayesian Belief
Networks (BBNs) based on the theory of causality [40] with allowance for linear
and nonlinear dependences.
In such problems, the use of a BBN that is a graphic model of probabilistic
interrelations on a set of variables together with the apparatus of mathematical
statistics provides a number of advantages, namely, it makes it possible to reveal
causal relationships between different variables and, hence, to facilitate the
understanding of complicated phenomena and processes such as sustainable
development. Moreover, a BBN possessing both causal and probabilistic semantics
is a convenient means for joint representation of expert knowledge determining
causal relationships and instrumentally obtained statistical data (measurements,
observations, and computations).
4.6.1
The Methodology of Sustainable Development
Evaluation in Terms of Quality and Security
of the Human Life
The important issue in the process of implementation of the concept of sustainable
development is the formation of the measurement system (Matrix) for the quanti-
tative and qualitative assessment of this complicated procedure.
The process of sustainable development will be characterized according to two
main components: security (Csl) and quality (Cql) of the human life (4.19).
Under this concept, the generalized measure (index) of sustainable development
can be presented by means of the quaternion {Q}:
Q
f g ¼ jwslCsl þ wql Cql
! Ie;Iec;Is;

	
:
ð4:19Þ
The quaternion {Q} includes an imaginary scalar part j wslCsl which describes the
security of human life and a real scalar part as a projection of the norm of vector
radius ~Cql to an ideal vector with coordinates (1;1;1) which describes the quality of
human
life
within
three
dimensions:
economic
(Iec),
ecological
(Ie)
and
socio-institutional (Is). Also we denote wsl ¼ 1=
ﬃﬃ
½
p
312; wql ¼ 1=
ﬃﬃﬃ
3
p
. Under this
condition j gains a value of a real unit for a normal regular state of society
development at Csl > 0 and a value of an imaginary unit when a society enters
conﬂict state (Csl = 0):

examined in detail in Sect. 4.2.3 and is represented by the set of threats (Table 4.3)
and formula (4.12). Therefore, further on, we will examine in more detail the
component of the quality of human life Cql(Iec, Ie, Is).
Sustainable development estimation methodology in the context of quality
of human life. For every country the Euclidean norm of vector radius of human life
quality ~Cql

	
is given in the following form:
~Cql

 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
I2
ec þ I2
e þ I2
s
q
:
ð4:20Þ
In this case the indicators and policy categories which form the component of the
quality of human life Cql(Iec, Ie, Is) are calculated as a weighted total:
Ii ¼
X
n
j¼1
wjxi;j; i ¼ 1; m;
X
n
j¼1
wj ¼ 1;
ð4:21Þ
where Ii is a value of an indicator or a category of policy for ith country (the number
of the countries is m), wj is weight of the jth component of I index (the number of
the components is n), xi,j is a value of the jth component for ith country.
Such representation of integrated indices (indicators and categories of policy)
envisages that components of xi,j in the formula (4.21) must be non-dimensional
and vary within the same range.
Considering the fact that all data, indicators and indices included into the model
are measured by virtue of different physical values, may be interpreted differently
and change within the different ranges, they were aggregated to the standard form in
such a way that all their variations would occur within the range from 0 to 1. To
carry out this normalization, the formulas (4.10–4.11) can be used.
This normalization gives the possibility to calculate each of Iec, Ie, Is indices and
with the help of them the components with appropriate weighting coefﬁcients. Then
the quantitative value of human life quality can be identiﬁed as projection of the
norm of this vector to an ideal vector with coordinates (1; 1; 1), (Fig. 4.22):

ð4:22Þ
The deviation angle a of the vector’s radius Cql from the ideal vector (1, 1, 1) is
estimated on the basis of the values of dimensions Iec, Ie, Is in the following way:

ð4:23Þ
Thus, the projection of the norm of the vector’s radius ~Cql to the ideal vector (1,
1, 1) characterizes the human life quality and the attitude position of the vector ~Cql
in the coordinate system (Iec, Ie, Is) characterizes the “harmonization” level of
sustainable development. We should mention that when the angle a approaches 0,
the harmonization level of sustainable development increases, i.e. the equidistance
of the vector ~Cql from each of coordinates (Iec, Ie, Is) will correspond to the highest
harmonization value of sustainable development. If this vector approaches one of
these coordinates, this will indicate the priority direction of the corresponding
dimension development and neglect of two others. Let the value G = 1 −a be the
harmonization
level
of
sustainable
development.
It
will
increase
when
G approaches 1 and decrease when G approaches 0.
As the researches of human life quality and security are conducted with the help
of different methods and sets of initial data, it is worth performing them separately
in three stages. At the ﬁrst stage we will analyze the human life quality as one of the
components of sustainable development. At the second stage we will investigate the
Fig. 4.22 Human life quality component (Сql) and harmonization level (G = 1 −a)

human life security as another component of sustainable development. And at the
third stage we will calculate the aggregate value of the Sustainable Development
Index using two components and investigate this index.
In order to conduct the research of the life quality component of sustainable
development, it is necessary to sample the data with the help of which each of three
dimensions of sustainable development will be characterized in the most appro-
priate way. These data shall conform to the following important requirements: they
have to be formed annually on continuing basis by respected and recognized
international organizations.
Thus, the life quality component of sustainable development Cql and the har-
monization level of sustainable development G = 1 −a are calculated on the basis
of their constituents Iec, Ie, Is. Considering the requirements to initial data men-
tioned above the value of every dimension Iec, Ie, Is will be calculated according to
ﬁve global indices widely used in the international practice (Table 4.17), being
annually formed by the recognized international organizations. Let us consider all
of them.
The Economic Dimension Index (Iec) is formed on the basis of aggregation of
two global indices (Table 1.17).
1. The Global Competitiveness Index (Ic) was created by the organizers of the
World Economic Forum. This index is annually estimated for 139 world eco-
nomics and published in the form of so-called “Global competitiveness report”
(World Economic Forum, www.weforum.org). To reduce the correlation
between parts of quality of life we constructed own index based on original one.

It is formed of the following three groups of indicators: 1—the group of indi-
cators of basic requirements (Basic requirements); 2—the group of indicators of
the stimulants efﬁciency (Efﬁciency stimulants) and 3—the group of indicators of
innovation (Innovation).
The ﬁrst group includes two complex categories of economic policy:
Infrastructure and Macroeconomic Environment. The second one consists of ﬁve
policy categories: market size; the level of ﬁnancial market development; techno-
logical readiness; labor market efﬁciency; effectiveness of goods and services. The
third group involves three indicators: patent apps; technicians in R&D; charges for
the use of intellectual property, payments.
2. The Index of Economic Freedom (Ief) was created by the Heritage Foundation
(The Heritage Foundation, www.heritage.org/index/). This index is formed of
the following twelve indicators: Property rights; Government integrity; Judicial
effectiveness; Government spending; Tax burden; Fiscal heath; Business free-
dom; Labor freedom; Monetary freedom; Trade freedom; Investment freedom;
Financial freedom.
The Ecological Dimension Index (Ie) will be estimated with the help of EPI
(Environmental Performance Index (Yale Center for Environmental Low& Policy,
www.epi.yale.edu). This index is formed by the Yale Center of Environmental
Law and Policy together with Columbia University (USA) for 163 countries of the
world.
To calculate this index the aggregation method is used according to which EPI
index is formed of two categories of top-level environmental policy (Environmental
health, being the sanitary state of environment, and Ecosystem vitality, which is the
vital ability of the ecosystem), nine medium-level ecological indicators and 14
low-level indicators.
The presented index and its indicators identify the ability of every country to
protect its environment both during a current period of time and also in long-term
perspective, on the basis of availability of national environmental system, the ability
to resist to environmental impacts and decrease in human dependence on envi-
ronmental impacts, social and institutional resources of a country to meet the
environmental challenges, possibility of global control over the environmental state
of the country etc. Moreover, they can be used as a powerful tool for making
decisions on the analytical basis including social and economic dimensions of
sustainable development of the country.
The Social Dimension index (Is) will be formed of six indices: Health, wellness
and basics needs; Education; Personal rights and freedom; Personal safety;
Corruption perception; Social Infrastructure. These indices are formed with the help
of following indicators: human life cost, leisure and culture of people, economic
state of the country, environmental state of the country, human freedom, human
health, an infrastructure state, life risks and safety, nation poverty factors, level of
unemployment, human health-care activities, gender conditions in the country and
other.

Table 4.18 shows the groups of policy categories and indicators used for global
modeling of sustainable development processes.
As it is shown in Tables 4.17 and 4.18, life quality component of sustainable
development Cql and its harmonization degree G = 1 −a were determined with the
usage of 73 indicators.
On the basis of description of relations between different categories of policy and
indicators reduced to common calculating platform, the mathematical SDGM
model was developed, the structure of which is presented in Fig. 4.23.
It was taken into account that all data, indicators and indexes included into
model (Fig. 4.23) are measured with the help of different physical quantities, may
be interpreted differently and change within different ranges. That is why they were
normalized for their changes to occur within range from 0 to 1. In this case the
worst values of mentioned indicators conform to numeral values close to 1. Such
normalization gives the opportunity to calculate every index Iec, Ie, Is and com-
ponent Cql through their components with appropriate weight coefﬁcients. In their
turn the weight coefﬁcients in the formula of calculation of life quality component
of sustainable development Cql are selected in order to give the possibility to
provide equal values of economic, ecological and social dimension in the coordi-
nate system (Iec, Ie, Is).
Therefore, the SDGM model gives the possibility to calculate life quality
component of sustainable development Cql and harmonization degree of this
development G = 1 −a for every country of the world for which data about global
indexes and indicators exist (Table 4.18).
4.6.2
Some Basic Deﬁnitions and Concepts
This investigation is devoted to the determination of causal relations between the
mentioned threats (Table 4.3) and indicators of sustainable development (4.12),
(4.19–4.22) at a qualitative level. On this basis, a holistic interpretation of processes
of sustainable development of countries and regions of the world is developed and
also the vulnerability of this development to the inﬂuence of the collection of the
mentioned threats is estimated.
Let’s introduce some basic deﬁnitions and concepts:
1. We consider the collection of global threats (Table 4.3) that exert inﬂuence on
the sustainable development of countries and regions of the world [39]. Initial
quantitative data on indicators of sustainable development, on each of these
threats, and also on gross domestic products (GDPs) of countries that will be
used for the construction of BBNs are presented in [39]. Since these data vary
within different ranges and have different physical dimensions, we will use their
normalized values:

2. A Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) is a directed acyclic graph in which each
vertex is associated with a discrete random quantity Xi; i ¼ 1; n, assuming
values x j
i ; j ¼ 1; mi and arcs determine causal relations between random quan-
tities. Vertices of this graph are associated with tables of conditional probabil-
ities calculated by the Bayes formula

of the events a and b, and P(b|a) and P(a|b) are probabilities of occurrence of the
event b provided that event a has occurred and, on the contrary, the occurrence
of a provided that the event b has occurred.
3. Using the terminology of hypotheses and evidence, we denote by H an event in
the case when a given hypothesis is true and by E an event in the case when a
deﬁnite testimony (evidence) has come that can testify to the mentioned
hypothesis. Then formula (4.26) can be rewritten in the form

Relationship (4.18) establishes a relation of a hypothesis with evidence and also
establishes a relation of the evidence being observed with a hypothesis that is not
yet justiﬁed. This interpretation also presumes the determination of the a priori
probability of the hypothesis P(H) that is ﬁxed prior to the observation or mani-
festation of some fact.

The determination of new evidences of the form E j
i : Xi ¼ x j
i ; i ¼ 1; n; j ¼ 1; mi;
in a BBN leads to the assignment of a posteriori probability (4.27) to each
hypothesis of the form H j
i : Xi ¼ x j
i ; i ¼ 1; n; j ¼ 1; mi, this probability determines
the degree of belief in this hypothesis [41].
4. For the synthesis of a BBN from data on the threats presented above, two
problems should be solved. The ﬁrst problem is connected with the selection of
signiﬁcant variables and deﬁnition of causal relations on their set and, as a rule,
is solved owing to the involvement of experts in the ﬁeld of analysis of threats.
The second problem lies in the formation of tables of conditional probabilities
that are associated with vertices of the graph of the BBN. This problem can be
solved on the basis of computation of conditional probabilities from available
experimental data on threats. It should be noted that if experimental data on
threats are presented in interval scales [42], then they should be digitized, for
example, with the use of clusterization by the method of k-means [43]. In
essence, the passage from quantitative estimates to qualitative ones is performed
at this stage.
5. If a BBN has been constructed, then, specifying a threshold value for the degree
of belief, one can determine the set of conﬁrmed hypotheses for various col-
lections of evidences. Generalizing these data, we obtain a qualitative charac-
teristic of relations between threats Xi; i ¼ 1; n:
A distinctive feature of the model being considered is that the involvement of
insigniﬁcant threats and causal relations between them in this model leads to a
signiﬁcant growth in the dimension of the model. For example, to specify tables of
conditional probabilities for a model in which dependences on all 12 global threats
are determined for each indicator of sustainable development provided that mi ¼
3; i ¼ 1; n; it is required to use 7  312 ¼ 3720087 real numbers. Hence, the number
of vertices and arcs of the BBN should be decreased with preserving only essential
variables and relations between them. A possible method of overcoming the
mentioned “dimensionality” problem is the application of statistical dependency
analysis with the use of methods of estimating correlations [44] or calculation of
entropy [45]. In particular, correlation analysis makes it possible to obtain an
estimate for the linear dependence between variables and to determine parameters
of a linear model. The calculation of conditional entropy can also be used as an
indication of nonlinear dependences but, in this case, it does not provide any
information on the kind of such a dependence.

Synthesis of Topologies of BBNs
Let the information entropy of a discrete random quantity Xi; i ¼ 1; n (a threat, an
indicator of sustainable development, and a GDP) that can assume values
x j
i ; j ¼ 1; mi, be computed by the formula

and let it be an averaged quantitative estimate of the indeﬁniteness (unexpected-
ness) of occurring events connected with the fact that a variable Xi assumes values
x j

tion on a variable Xi [46] is speciﬁed by the formula

(4.29), the measure of the speciﬁc informativeness of a variable can be deﬁned as

ð4:30Þ
We represent the results of computations of the value of is by formula (4.30) for
a collection of variables from Table 4.14. In particular, the speciﬁc informativeness
of the variable GDP is equal to 0.64. Accordingly, we have Is = 1.00, Iql = 1.00,
SF = 1.00,
Q = 0.99,
IG = 0.99,
CP = 0.98,
Iec = 0.97,
GINI = 0.97,
GD = 0.95, Ie = 0.95, NI = 0.93, Isec = 0.80, CI = 0.80, BB = 0.77, ND = 0.72,
WA = 0.71, ES = 0.25, and GW = 0.19. Here, the variables ES (Global decrease
in energy security) and ND (vulnerability to natural disasters) can be excluded from
consideration since it is poorly informative.
To quantitatively characterize the mutual inﬂuence between variables Xi and Xk,
i ¼ 1; n; k ¼ 1; n we will use the concept of mutual information [46]
I Xi; Xk

According to [46], mutual information is a statistical function of two random
quantities that determines the amount of information contained in one random
quantity Xi with respect to another Xk: For mutual information, the following
symmetry property is satisﬁed: I Xi; Xk
ð
Þ ¼ I Xk; Xi

Using the formula for mutual information (4.31) and its upper limit (4.32), the
speciﬁc mutual informativeness for variables Xi and Xk, i ¼ 1; n; k ¼ 1; n can be
found as follows:
Is Xi; Xk

ð4:33Þ
It is obvious that we have Is Xi; Xi
ð
Þ ¼ 1: If these variables are independent, then
we have Is Xi; Xk
ð
Þ ¼ 0:
Based on data of Table 4.19 and using formula (4.33), values of speciﬁc mutual
informativeness Is Xi; Xk
ð
Þ were calculated for the GDP level and indicators of
sustainable development and threats (Table 4.20).
If a threshold value Ist Xi ; Xk
ð
Þ is speciﬁed (in this case, we have
Ist Xi ; Xk
ð
Þ 
 0:75Þ, then essential dependences between global threats and indi-
cators of sustainable development can be singled out (in Table 4.20, these indi-
cators are highlighted by a heavy faced type).
As can be seen from Table 4.20, the variables BB, GD, ND, NI, WA, GINI have
less inﬂuence on the indicators of the sustainable development. The indirect
inﬂuence of these indicators is deﬁned similarly using the calculation of joint
information for the threats.
The BBN topology synthesized in this manner and destined for the conceptual
analysis and modeling of the inﬂuence of global threats on the sustainable devel-
opment of countries and regions of the world can be represented by the block
diagram depicted in Fig. 4.24.

discrete variables can be used within the framework of a BBN model. We also
specify unknown values of variables (U).
2. Construction of a Bayesian Belief Network. For the construction and para-
metric adjustment of such a model, we will use the system GeNIe 2.0 [48]
destined for the construction and modeling of Bayesian networks. In Fig. 4.25,
the appearance of a Bayesian Belief Network constructed in the system GeNIe
2.0 is presented. Such a BBN allows one to estimate the degree of belief in
hypotheses with respect to the inﬂuence of various threats on indicators of
sustainable development of countries and regions of the world and causal
relations between these variables.

In particular, for example, the evidences P E1 : GDP ¼ H
ð
Þ ¼ 1 is established.
As a result, the degree of belief in the hypotheses H1 : Q ¼ H
ð
Þ, H2 : Iql ¼ H

H3 : Isec ¼ H

Þ is very high and
amounts to 1.00 but, for example, for the hypothesis H7 : CP ¼ L
ð
Þ; the degree of
belief equals 0.25. Countries with a high level of GDP always have a high value of
all indicators of sustainable development, but relative to threats, for example CP, it
doesn’t mean anything.
3. Modeling of a BBN. In modeling a BBN, we establish the task of testing
following hypotheses: «If the value (evalue) of some model’s variable (evar) is
known, what will be the expected value (hvalue) of another variable (hvar).».
For this hypothesis we have:
pðh :
hvar ¼ hvalue
ð
Þ
½
j e : evar ¼ evalue
½

g;

To test the formulated hypotheses, the library SMILE [48] was used. In this case,
a BBN was modelled with an exhaustive search for evidence.
Thus, the collection of results were obtained whose total length equaled 316 ¼
43; 046; 721 rows. It is obvious that their semantic interpretation for this length is a
practically impossible task.
In this connection, it is necessary to reduce data end formally generalize them.
To reduce the data we estimated the probabilities of the ﬁrst (a) and second (b)
types error and removed the rows with high a values and low values (1 −b).
4. Formal Generalization of Results of Modeling. To generalize the obtained
results, we apply the set-theoretic approach [49] according to which a gener-
alization of the facts presented by their speciﬁcations can be obtained as a result
of set-theoretic operations over these speciﬁcations. We associate with evidence
E j

where Pt is a given threshold for belief.
We also deﬁne f EU

dences e ¼ E1; E2; . . .; En:

Interpretation of the Generalized Results of Modeling
In Table 4.21, the results of modeling are generalized that are represented by
minimal sets of collections of evidences that are justiﬁed by the hypotheses,
respectively.

Analysis of the simulation results in Table 4.21 (the evidence are shown in bold)
allows us to assess the expected level of the indicators of the sustainable devel-
opment and the degree of manifestation of threats in conditions of uncertainty,
when the values of some indicators are unknown.
For example, based on the analysis of lines 1–15, in which hypotheses are given,
and the condition that one of the indicators of the sustainable development is known,
it can be said that the indicators of the sustainable development are closely inter-
related. Thus, a high level of GDP is always accompanied by high levels of all
indicators of sustainable development (line 1); a low level of Iql is accompanied by
low levels of GDP and Is, and it is also a determining factor for the low level of Q
(line 5); a high level of Iec is accompanied by high levels of indicators Ie, Is, Isec and
determines a high level of indicators Q and Iql (line 9); if it is known that Ie has a low
level we can say that GDP, Q and Iql will also have a low level (line 10); knowing
that the Is level is low allows us to say that GDP and Iql levels are also low (line 11);
the high level of Is is accompanied by a high level of all indicators of the sustainable
development with the exception of those that are directly related to economic
development, i.e. GDP and Iec (line 12); low Isec level is accompanied by low levels
of GDP, Q and Is indicators, as well as low level of ND threat (line 13).
In general, knowing the levels of the sustainable development indicators does
not provide an opportunity to predict the levels of threat indicators (lines 1–15).
In the second part of the table (lines 16–28) hypotheses are given, provided that
the level of one of the threats is known. The analysis of these lines allows us to say
that threats are interrelated with each other, some of them inﬂuence the indicators of
the sustainable development directly and others inﬂuence indirectly.
For example, a low level of CI is accompanied by low levels of ND and WA
(line 16); if it is known that the level of CP is low then the level of ND, WA and SF
threats will also be low, and this corresponds to a high level of Iec and Isec
indicators (line 18); the high level of the CP threat is accompanied by a high level
of the CI threat (line 20); high level of GD threat manifestation corresponds to high
level of the NI and SF threats (line 21); a low level of NI identiﬁes the fact that the
threats CP, IC, WA and SF also has a low level, and the sustainability indicators Iec
and Isec will be high (line 24); low level of the SF threat corresponds to low levels
of the IC, ND and WA threats, as well as high level of Isec indicator.

Visualization of Data on Indicators of Sustainable
Development for Countries and Regions of the World
In this section we will present in the table and visual forms relations between levels
of vulnerability of countries and regions of the world to global threats and indi-
cators of sustainable development in the global context. Data for indicators of
sustainable development, global threats, safety levels and also GDPs for countries
of the world in 2016 are taken from [4], ordered in accordance with the method of
cluster analysis (4.13) and presented in Table 4.22.

Inﬂuence of Global Threats on the Sustainable Development …
249

Based on the data presented in Table 4.22, Fig. 4.26a, b illustrate the indicators
of sustainable development and people’s quality of life for different countries and
regions of the world.
4.6.7
Conclusions
1. This section proposes an approved methodology of application of BBNs to the
qualitative analysis of dependences and establishment of causal relations
between levels of vulnerability of countries and regions of the world to global
threats and indicators of sustainable development in the global context.
2. Measures of speciﬁc informativeness of a variable and speciﬁc mutual infor-
mativeness of variables are introduced that can be used for the selection of
essential variables, and also deﬁnitions are given for causal relations between
them in synthesizing topologies of BBNs. It is shown that the inﬂuence of
threats such as the vulnerability to natural disasters, balance between the bio-
logical productivity of a territory and its total consumption, income inequality,
instability of a state on the level of sustainable development of countries of the
world is less essential in comparison with other global threats. Therefore, these
threats were excluded from consideration.
3. BBNs were modelled with a view to testing 316 hypothesis. We used the sig-
niﬁcance of a and the power of (1 −b) as a criterion for data reduction.
A method of generalization of the modeling results is proposed that is based on
the construction of a Boolean function for a set of collections of evidences,
which makes it possible to use the methods of Boolean algebra for obtaining a
minimal set of evidences collections justifying each hypothesis.
4. Analysis of the modeling results allows us to draw out the conclusions that the
indicators of the sustainable development are closely interrelated, but knowl-
edge of their values does not give grounds for expecting any speciﬁc levels of
threats. On the other hand, threats are also interconnected, some of which have a
direct impact on indicators of the sustainable development, others has an indi-
rect one. If the values of some threats are known then it identiﬁes the level of
indicators of the sustainable development in certain cases.

adequately describe the regularities of world conﬂicts remains one of the most
important yet unsolved problems the science is facing. Despite numerous attempts,
no adequate scientiﬁcally justiﬁed metric toolkit has been proposed yet for global
forecast and prediction of the development of world conﬂicts, which is especially
necessary when the global civilization enters the XXIst century as a special critical
phase of its development [18, 26, 30].
In the context of ﬁnding a solution to this problem, being based on systemic
generalization of the results of analysis of an extensive empirical material [1, 51,
52], the studies [2, 20, 29] revealed and justiﬁed a hypothetical pattern of systemic
world conﬂicts, based on the so-called dynamic model of C-waves, which is based
on the “golden section” metric.
In this section we will propose a general concept of C-waves of systemic world
conﬂicts, on the basis of generalization and formalization of the approaches con-
sidered in [2, 20, 29]. We will analyze the class of C-waves, which envelopes
super-long time intervals. We will show that the pattern of big C-waves is invariant
with respect to the evolution of the nature of world conﬂicts.
4.7.1
Some Concepts and Deﬁnitions
Let Wc(m, n) be a set of all world conﬂicts occurred from year m th to n th, where
m, n  Z; Z is the set of integer numbers.
In what follows, we will consider that years of the Common era (AD) correspond
to positive numbers m and n, and years before Christ (BC) correspond to negative
ones.
Let us associate any s that belongs to time interval J m; n

4.7.3
Signiﬁcant Features of SWC-Concept
We will assume that the correspondence of the SWC-concept under study to the
structural harmony principle is its main key feature (F1) [29].
Let
T Ck
ð
Þ ¼ sk;0; sN1;0 ¼ sN;0 ¼ kc:
ð4:49Þ
Then, according to (4.38) and (4.41), variation in life cycle duration of the
T Ck
ð
Þ—sequence of Ck-waves, k ¼ 1; N, obeys the following principle:
T Ck
ð
Þ ¼ FNk þ 1  kc;
ð4:50Þ
where FNk þ 1—is a number from the Fibonacci sequence. This testiﬁes that golden
section is present in the structure of
SWC
ð
Þa-ensemble; and according to the
structural harmony principle [23], in any self-organizing system, special time scale
corresponds to each operating mode that varies according to variation of structural
states of the system. This time scale is “tied” to a certain invariant of generalized
golden section as a characteristic of steady state of the system.
We will call constant kc a universal time metric quantum of the life cycles of Ck-
waves of SWC
ð
Þa-ensemble. In what follows, we will call the Fibonacci regularity
(4.38), (4.41), (4.49), (4.50) of the development of systemic world conﬂicts the
F-regularity.
The second key feature (F2) of the considered concept is that the universal effect
of acceleration of historical time is revealed in the proposed dynamic model of C-
waves [19, 24, 27] since according to (4.38), (4.41) successive reduction of the

order of Ck-waves with

duration of life cycles of C-waves of the development of systemic world conﬂicts
takes place as an essential component of the integral evolutionary development of
the civilization.
The third important property (F3) of Ck-waves is their strict hierarchy with
respect to the power E i;k of phases fk;i, k ¼ 1; N; i ¼ 1; 5, of their evolutionary
development (Fig. 4.29).
Based on the features F1–F3 and taking into account (4.34–4.48) and Figs. 4.27,
4.28, it follows that the family M c m; n
ð
Þ of Ck-waves forms the sequence of
irregular, self-similar, local objects that, in turn, allows us to consider the SWC
ð
Þa-
ensemble of waves of systemic world conﬂicts as a global, integral, self-organizing
space–time object of fractal nature.

of C-Waves of Systemic World Conﬂicts for Big
Historical Data
Let us use the above deﬁnitions and notation and consider the general solution
scheme for the problem of identiﬁcation of C-waves of systemic world conﬂicts for
big historical data.
The First Stage. Statistical analysis of historical data and deﬁnition of the set
Wc r; l
ð
Þ of all world conﬂicts that took place from year rth to year lth. By world
conﬂicts we will mean conﬂicts that claimed no less than 1000 lives according to
available information sources.
The Second Stage. Generating the sequence

ð

ð
Þ of groups of world
conﬂicts (4.34).
The Third Stage. Solving the problem of the existence, on the chosen time
intervals J (m, n), of block matrices of the form a ¼ J vE
½
 that satisfy conditions
(4.38–4.45) and developing the algorithms to construct such matrices.
We will distinguish two essentially different cases.
Case 1 Assume that the required block matrix a is constructed on the time inter-
val:J (m, n), where r  m\n  l. This means that the family Mc m; n
ð
Þ of identiﬁed
Ck-waves, k ¼ 1; N, “completely falls within” the initial time interval J (r, l). It is
obvious that in this case the family Mc m; n
ð
Þ was “revealed” and “remained” as a
completed integral object in the historical past.
In this case, for the process of evolutionary structurization of the
SWC
ð
Þa-
ensemble of waves of systemic world conﬂicts on the time interval J (m, n), we will
call block matrix a an empirical matrix; J an empirical interval matrix;v an
empirical chronometric matrix; and E an empirical energy matrix.
Case 2 Let on the considered time interval J (r, l) only the fragment
of some integral ensemble
be “re-
vealed” and “completely fall” within it, and let it be identiﬁed by the ﬁrst M rows of
some block matrix a of the form (4.34), namely, by elements J k;i, sk;i, Ek;i,
k ¼ 1; M; i ¼ 1; 5, constructed on the basis of empirical material. It is natural that
this number M should be large enough for the hypothetical statement about the
manifestation of the F-regularity for the ﬁrst M waves of SWC
ð
Þa-ensemble.
A “missing” fragment


of the ensemble, which is
hypothetically deﬁned by the unknown elements J k;i, sk;i, and Ek;i for M < k  N,
i ¼ 1; 5, can be “restored” according to (4.38–4.45), by extrapolating the revealed
F-regularity for M < k  N, i = 1; 5. To improve and correct the values of J k;i,
sk;i, and Ek;i for M < k  N, i = 1; 5, we can use additional information and
factors of various nature from adjacent scientiﬁc ﬁelds (Fig. 4.32). In this case, we

will talk about the hypothetical F-regularity of the development of systemic world
conﬂicts on the time interval J (m, n). For the process of evolutionary structur-
ization of (SWC)a-ensemble on the time interval J (m, n), we will call block matrix
a hypothetic matrix, J hypothetic interval matrix, v hypothetic chronometric
matrix, and E hypothetic energy matrix.

4.7.6
Big C-Waves of Systemic World Conﬂicts
According to the basic deﬁnition, various classes (families) of C-waves of systemic
world conﬂicts can hypothetically exist on different time intervals. However, as
follows from [25, 53], of greatest interest among them are classes of C-waves that
envelope superbig time intervals, whose F-regularity of the development is invariant
with respect to the evolution of the nature of world conﬂicts. In what follows, it is
such C-waves that we will call big waves of systemic world conﬂicts (brieﬂy, big C-
waves). Note that knowledge about the structural parameters of big C-waves plays
an important role in the development of new metric approaches in solving problems
of predicting global periodic civilization processes of various nature [1, 2, 53].
On the basis of systematically generalized results of analysis of the empirical
sequence of world conﬂicts that took place from 2500 BC to 2007 AD [4–6], the

studies [7–9] identify the ensemble
of big C-waves of
world conﬂicts (of dimension dim ( SWC
ð
Þa) = 7) on superbig time interval J
(−750; 2092) of approximately 3000 years, which envelopes various epochs of the
development of the civilization. The invariance of F-regularity of the development
of the identiﬁed Ck-waves with respect to the evolution of the nature of world
conﬂicts is illustrated by Fig. 4.33.
On the time interval J (−750, 2007), six “exhibited” Ck-waves of systemic world
conﬂicts were identiﬁed. Structural parameters of the seventh, ﬁnal (predicted)
wave C7 are found by extrapolating the revealed F-regularity for the fragment
of the SWC
ð
Þa-ensemble of waves of systemic world
conﬂicts.
To improve and update the predicted values of structural parameters of wave C7,
we used additional information from various adjacent scientiﬁc ﬁelds. For example,
we took into account the inﬂuence of 12 global threats that can “heat up” the global
world conﬂict generated by the wave C7, called the “Conﬂict of the 21st century”
(Table 4.3).
We also took into account possible inﬂuence of some other special local factors
on the values of structural parameters of the predicted C7-wave. Some of them are
presented in Fig. 4.34 for energy safety (ES) threat, where t
HK is the Horner–
Kapitsa singularity point [21]; t
N is the Newton singularity point. We also speciﬁed
critical time intervals related to exhaustion of traditional energy resources of the
Earth: oil (O), gas (G), and uranium (U).
We have found the values of elements J k;i, sk;i, Ek;i, k ¼ 1; 7; i ¼ 1; 5, of the
hypothetic block matrix a ¼ J vE

A key feature of the identiﬁed family of big Ck-waves, k ¼ 1; 7, of systemic
world conﬂicts is that the most powerful (predicted) ﬁnal C7-wave completely “falls
within” the 21st century, and according to different independent sources [2, 24, 26,
27, 30, 54–58], the peak of “System tsunami of the 21st century” or “New phase
passage” is in its middle. If the trends formed at the previous phases of the history
remain the same, these shocks will hypothetically lead the mankind to another
phase of the development (a combination of technological progress and a big war
[58] as the most probable scenario).

Conclusions
1. The generalization and formalization of approaches to the recognition of
C-waves of global systemic conﬂicts through big historical data have been
carried out and general concept of description and interpretation of these waves
has been proposed. On the basis of intellectual analysis of big data on the
conﬂicts, taking place since 750 B.C. up to now, have been analyzed and their
general pattern has been revealed. There has been made an attempt to foresee the
next global conﬂict called the conﬂict of the 21st century. Its nature and main
characteristics have been analyzed.
2. The hypotheses for a metric relation between the global periodic processes,
namely between the sequence of 11-year cycles of solar activity, so called
Kondratieff cycles of the development of the global economy, and the process of
evolutionary structuration of the family of the C-waves of global systemic
conﬂicts have been formulated. There has also been made an attempt to predict
these processes in the 21st century by using a metric approach.
3. The possible scenarios of the development of the conﬂict of the 21st century have
been constructed and analyzed. This analysis led to the following conclusions:
3:1. Since for k [ 7, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers
F8k
f
gk2N for the
sequence of big Ck-waves, k = 1,7, is degenerated, the revealed F-regularity
fails on the time interval t [ 2092. Therefore, natural questions arise: What
the 21st century has in store for the civilization? What is the nature of the ﬁnal
state of civilization as a system? What should happen to the world civilization
after 2092, in particular, in the 22nd century? Probably, the ﬁnal cycle of
some global evolutionary chain of the development of the mankind begins?
3:2. One can ﬁnd the answer to this question in the studies by two outstanding
scientists of the last century, can be found in the studies of the outstanding
scientists of the last century, Vernadskiy [22] and Moisejev [25].
Independently one from the other, they formulated a very close idea: if the
mankind, in the planetary scale, does not change radically its behavior
(using its mind and its labor for self-destruction), in the middle of the 21st
century there can occur the conditions under which people cannot exist.
These conclusions were made for the paradigm permanent for the whole
history of the mankind: “unlimited and increasing consumption” and for the
technosphere (set of technological lifestyles) unfriendly for human inhabi-
tance, developed in the 19th and beginning of the 21st centuries.
3:3. If the mankind can change the paradigm of its behavior in the planetary
scale, for example, to “harmonic coexistence” and radically transform the
technosphere to “nature-like” (friendly to the human environment, based on
the
convergence
of
nano-,
bio-,
information,
cognitive,
and
socio-humanitarian technologies [53]), then the regularity revealed for the
previous paradigm of the development of systemic world conﬂicts, which
corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence, will fail for the new paradigm,
which will allow the mankind to continue its mission on the Earth.
