Implementation of the Ising Model in the
Compound Energy Method
Dedicated to Dr. rer. nat. Hans Leo Lukas on the occasion of his 65th birthday
The implementation of the pair approximation of the Isıng
model in the framework of the Compound Energy Method
for a phase with two sublattices is discussed. The energy of
exchanging the positions of the atoms ın an AB pair accord-
ing to the Compound Energy Method ıs derived and the
configurational entropy ıs changed from the point to the
pair approximation. This is then generalized by extending
it to a phase described with four sublattices.
1 Introduction
Thermodynamic calculations of equilibria and phase dia-
grams have become a useful tool for materials develop-
ment. In this approach the thermodynamic properties of
the individual phases in a material are modelled as a func-
tion of temperature, pressure, composition and possible in-
ternal degrees of freedom. These models have parameters
that are fitted to experimental data on binary and ternary
systems and experience has shown that this often ıs enough
to give accurate results when calculations are made for real
multicomponent materials with up to 8 or 10 components.
Many of the crystalline phases like carbides, intermetallics
etc. are solutions and have complex structures and the Com-
pound Energy Method (CEM) [86And] has proved very use-
ful in modelling the properties of such phases.
In real materials the most important phase transforma-
tions are between phases with completely different struc-
tures, like solidification or precipitation of carbides or ox-
ides from some matrix phase. Prediction of order/disorder
transformations in a crystalline phase ıs usually of second-
ary interest and, in fact, superstructures of a phase has often
been modelled independently from the same phase ın the
disordered state. On the other hand, considerable interest
has been devoted to develop unified models suitable for
phases which may
order with
various
superstructures,
like the L1» and L1o ordering ın the fcc phase. In a super-
structure the atoms arrange themselves periodically on
different sublattices in the original disordered phase which
results in long range order (lro). Short range order (sro)
means that the nearest neighbour environment for each
atom may deviate from what could be expected from a
random distribution of the atoms on the possible lattice
sites.

2 Models for Phases with Order/Disorder Transitions
The first attempt to model both long range and short range
ordering was made by Ising, dealing with magnetic spins ın
one dimension. Later Onsager [44Ons] extended this treat-
ment to two dimensions. For practical calculations the Clus-
ter Variation Method (CVM) developed by Kikuchi [5IKik]
has been a very successful approximation of the modelling
of order/disorder transformation in three dimensions.
For long range order it ıs possible to use sublattices to
describe the different types of superstructures whereas
short range order requires the use of clusters of two,
three, four or more atoms, representing the possible ar-
rangements of nearest neighbours, in order to calculate
the most stable structure. In CVM the sublattices are ımpli-
cit only and this requires a large number of clusters because
each cluster with a different distribution of the atoms on the
possible sublattices must be treated as a separate entity.
Sundman and Mohri [90Sun] have discussed how to im-
plement CVM ona substitutional fcc lattice using species to
represent the clusters. For the tetrahedron approximation of
CVM on the fcc lattice one must have the species Ay, AsB,
A»B>», AB; and B; to calculate the short range order contri-
bution. For the long range order description there are four
sublattices to consider and one must distinguish between the
four different species of A3B where the B atom is on one of
the different sublattices. In the same way there are sıx dif-
ferent A»B> and four more AB; giving in total 16 species to
describe long and short range order on the fcc lattice. With
more components and using larger clusters than the tetrahe-
dron, it becomes cumbersome to deal with thıs model. Thus
there is an interest to make simplifications by combining a
model with an explicit description of the sublattices, like
CEM, with a method to describe short range order. To
achieve this the quasichemical model for short range order
will first be examined.
3 The Quasichemical Model using the Sublattice
Notation
The quasichemical model has been developed by for exam-
ple Bethe [35Bet], Li [49Lı] and Guggenheim [51Gug] to
describe short range order. In its most well known form it
considers pairs of atoms and is valid only when the devia-
tion from random order is small. For a substitutional solu-

tion of A and B atoms the model can be derived in the fol-
lowing way. One assumes there is ahomogeneous reaction
between pairs of A and B atoms
AA +BB = AB + BA
(1)
If these species were molecules in the gas phase one would
have fractions paA,Pap and ppp as the AB and BA mole-
cules would be indistinguishable. However, ın a crystalline
phase the orientation of an AB bond is significant as it
would place the A or B atoms on different sites. Thus
AB and BA pairs must be treated as different.
If the lattice can be divided into two identical sublattices
with equal number of sites and all nearest neighbours on the
opposite sublattice, like in the B2 ordering, and assuming
random distribution of the atoms one can calculate the
pair probability, pag, that an A and a B atom are nearest
neighbours as
PaB = Ya)R
(2)
where y, and yy are the site fractions of A on sublattice’
and B on sublattice ”. The sum of the site fractions on each
sublattice is unity of course. However, if there is sro the
probability of an AB pair will be different from Eg. (2).
A critical property for short range order is the difference
in energy v, between an AB bond, Zap, and half the sum
of the energy of an AA and a BB bond, ı.e.
v=Eıp — 0.5(Esr + Epp)
(3)
When v is negative the phase may exhibit long or short
range order, if it is positive the phase has a tendency for
demixing. 2v is also the “reaction” energy of Eg.(1).
If the number of bonds per atoms ıs zand one assumes a
random distribution of the different pairs, the following
configurational entropy per mole of atoms is obtained
cf
zZ
Sm=- RZ (paaln(paa) + PapIn(paB) + Praln(PpRA)
+ Peeln(PBB))
(4)
This equation ıs an overestimation of the entropy due to the
factor 3 (except for the one-dimensional Ising case when
— 2). In order to correct for thıs one can divide the pair
probabilities pag Inside the logarıthms in Eg. (4) wıth the
product of the corresponding site fractions y,y5. Equa-
tion (4) would then be zero when Edq.(2)
ıs valıd,
ı.e.
when there is no sro, and one must add the ideal configura-
tıonal entropy to describe this state. The corrected config-
urational entropy expression for the quasichemical pair
model ıs

where

"GıB = Gpa >= = +0.5°Gı +0.5°Gg
(7)
The state with long range order ıs characterized with differ-
ent site fractions of the same element on the two sublattices.
This is ıdentical to having different probabilities for pairs
AB and BA. These pair probabilities are equal ın the disor-
dered state only.
4 The Compound Energy Method and the Pair
Probabilities
CEM can be used to describe phases with different types of
sites like a carbide with one or more sublattices for metals
and one or more for carbon. For example, the cementite
phase, stable in the Fe-Cr-C-N system, has been described
by a model (Fe,Cr);(C,N); by [93Du]. The parentheses sur-
round the atoms or species in each sublattice and the sub-
scripts 3 and
| are the relative number of sites on the dif-
ferent sublattices.
The same notation can be used also for superstructures
where the lattice sites are of the same kınd. A binary
two-sublattice phase, (A,B)o.s(A,B)o.;, can be used to de-
scribe for example B2 ordering ın the bcec phase as has
been done by Lacaze and Sundman [91Lac] in the ın Fe-
Sı system. This ıs ıdentical to a Bragg-Williams ordering
model [34Bra].
In the Compound Energy Method the molar Gibbs en-
ergy is usually divided into three terms like
Gm =" "Con - T Sn + On
(8)
The first term, ""G„ represents the “mechanical mixture”,
a linear combination of the Gibbs energies of the “com-
pounds” with one constituent in each sublattice that form
end members of the solution. In the next term, “S,
is
the configurational entropy and the final term is the excess
Gibbs energy, FG„. The configurational entropy in CEM is
calculated using the “point” approximation for each sublat-
tice separately. The three terms in CEM written explicitly
for the binary two-sublattice phase, (A,B)o.s(A,B)o.s above,

Using site fractions, y, etc., one may only calculate the
random pair probabilities when Eg. (2) ıs valıd. For a phase
with sro a deviation from the random pair probabilities must
be introduced. This deviation will be described as
Dan = yaya —E
Pap = Yıayp +&
PBa = Ypya +E
PBB = YBYB 6
(12)
where y, and y, are the site fractions of A on sublattice one
and two, respectively, and & ıs the deviation from random-

eıs an additional “internal” degree of freedom in the phase
to describe the short range order.
Asa first approximation of the contribution due to short
range order one may simply replacing the fraction products,
yı)yp etc. in CEM with the pair probabilities, pa in the
"MG, and term and introduce the configurational entropy
accoding to Eg. (5). If all nearest neighbours are ona
dif-
ferent sublattice one may ignore the pairs ın the excess
Gibbs energy.
The mechanical mixture term can be modified as follows
by inserting the expression for the pair probabilities
„
Gn = (yAyX —E) Ga:a + (vAyE +E) Ga + (vR)ı

(13)
The first 4 terms ın the last expression are ıidentical to
Eq. (9). The term multiplied with e can be identified as
the bond energy or the energy to exchange an A and B
atom between the two sublattices.
AGaB = Gap + GBA - Ga:Aa— GBB
(14)
The configurational entropy contribution is obtained by ın-
serting the pair probabilities from Eg. (12) in Eq.(5) and
removing the parts that are already included ın Eg. (10),
one obtains

This equation can be used as it stands for B2 ordering in bcc
for example with z=8.
Short range ordering in fcc and hcp requires special at-
tention because it is impossible to obtain a state when all
nearest neighbours
to
an atom
are
the
other kind of
atom. In fcc and hcep all sıtes are identical and have 12 near-
est neighbours. The L1> superstructure, for example AusCu,
can be modelled with two sublattices, one wıth 3 times as
many sites as the other. Some nearest neighbours will then
be on the same sublattice but Eq. (15) can easıly be extended
to be a sum of pairs both between and within the sublattices.
But one must be careful to use the correct z between and
within the sublattices as the number of bonds from sublat-
tice
1 to sublattice 2 is not necessarily the same as from
sublattice 2 to sublattice I. But taking the number of sites
into account one has
a) 28!)
— az)
( 16)
where a“) is the relative number of sites on sublattice s and
z's’) means the number of bonds from sublattice s to t and
vice versa. Note that superscripts ın parenthesis and primes
both are used to denote sublattices, but from now primes
will be used only for site fractions. A superscript on the
Z. Metallkd. 87 (1996) 7
pair probabilities will be used to denote the sublattices
which form the pair. Applying Eg. (5) to each pair gives

where the summation over i is for all constituents on sub-
lattice s and the summatıon over j ıs for all constituents on
sublattice 1. The last summation multiplied by R ıs ıdentical
to the ideal configurational entropy already included ın
CEM and thus the first term ıs the contribution due to sro.
From the appropriate parts of Egs. (13) and (17) the con-
trıbution due to sro can be obtained as
og = ENGap —T "Sn
(18)
This is the general expression for the contribution to the
Gibbs energy due to short range order ın the pair approx1-
mation for a model with two sublattices. It must be solved
numerically by iterative methods but it ıs valıd indepen-
dently ıf there ıs simultaneous long range order or not.
The results of a calculation using thıs model and a com-
parison with the classıcal CEM and the quasichemical mod-
el are presented ın Figs. I and 2. All calculations were made
using A’Gx:g = —100R and z = 8. The calculations show
how some thermodynamic properties vary with tempera-
ture in the different models. In Fig. 1. the Gibbs energy
is plotted. The quasichemical model and the “pair” CEM
model are identical. As expected the CEM model without
short range order has the highest energy. Note that when the
phase has long range order the difference between the mod-
els with and without sro becomes very small. In Fig. 2 the
enthalpies for the same case as ın Fig. | are shown.

The superscript on the pair probabilities denote as before the

the pair probabilities in site fractions would give 12 site

rected by taking the geometric mean of the product, i.e.
raise it to 1/3, or in general 1/(m — 1) where m is the

One may try various ways to simplify the expression for the
bond energy. One way Is to assume that (1) the compound
energies are determined by bond energies between nearest
neighbours and (11) these are independent of composition.
For an fcc or hcp phase with 4 sublattices and 4 bonds be-
tween the sublattices with the energy v one obtains that all

tions specified by N. The dotsin "G..;... indicate the con-

Using this model for an fcc with four sublattices with
v= —1I00R and with the sro energy given by Eg. (28) gives
a phase diagram as shown in Fig. 3. This ıs very close to
what can be obtain with the more complex CVM tetrahe-
dron model, which ıs shown as dashed in the figure. In
Fig. 4 some comparisons of the Gibbs energy for different
models are shown. It is well known that sro decreases the
temperature of the transition to Iro compared to a model
without sro. But it is interesting to note that the model
with sro actually exhibits a long range order at the same
temperature as the phase without sro, but the Gibbs energy
for this state is higher than the disordered phase with just
sro, and it ıs thus a metastable state.
6 Summary
It has been shown how to ınclude a short range order con-
tribution to the Gibbs energy expression of the CEM using
the“pair” approximation to the configurational entropy. An
additional internal degree of freedom, &, ıs introduced to
describe the tendency to form pairs. The addition of sro
will enhance the possibilities to treat phases with order/dis-
order transformations using standard software for equilib-
rıum and phase diagram calculatıons. All calculations ın
this paper have been made with a slightly modified version
of the Thermo-Calc software system [85Sun].

than pairs by introducing tetrahedrons for example. Such
models depend closely on the
crystal
structure of the
phase. It ıs also possibly to use a similar approach for de-
scribing sro ın ionic liquids as proposed by Dessureault and
Pelton [91Des].
Financial support from TFR is gratefully acknowledged. The author is
grateful to Alan Oates and Suzana Fries for the inspiration to this work
and many helpful discussions.

Redaktionelle Notiz
Lieber Herr Petzow,
Ihre Kollegen der Schriftleitung und die Redaktion gratulie-
ren Ihnen, Schriftleiter der Zeitschrift für Metallkunde, zu
Ihrem 70. Geburtstag am 8. Juli. Wir wünschen Ihnen von
Herzen Gesundheit und weiterhin ungebrochene Schaffens-
kraft. Dieses Jubiläum ıst Anlaß, Ihnen für Ihren langjähri-
gen Einsatz als Schriftleiter dieser Zeitschrift zu danken.
Bezeichnend für Sıe und Ihre Einstellung zu der übernom-
menen Aufgabe ist, daß dieses Juliheft einem Mitarbeiter
und häufigem Autor dieser Zeitschrift gewidmet wurde.
Wir bewundern, daß Sie Ihre Arbeit als Herausgeber vor
allem
als
Dienst am
wissenschaftlichen
Gedankenaus-
tausch verstehen. Begutachtungen sind nach Ihrer Vorstel-
lung vor allem konstruktive Kritik, die den Autoren bei der
Einschätzung und Verbesserung ihrer Arbeit hilft. Forma-
listisches oder bürokratisches Vorgehen liegen Ihnen fern.
In allen „kritischen Fällen“ haben Sie als Schriftleiter die
Korrespondenz mit den Autoren direkt geführt und dabei
alle Entscheidungen stets sachlich und besonders aber die
schwierigen so gut wie möglich begründet.

So wıe das Gebiet der Materialkunde sıch ständig weiter-
entwickelt, so streben Sıe ın Ihrer Arbeit, die uns allen lieb
und wichtig ıst, danach, neue Aufgaben und Problemkreise
zu öffnen. Zwar spiegeln einige Themenschwerpunkte die-
ser Zeitschrift auch Ihre Hauptarbeitsgebiete wider, doch
sind Sıe mit der Ihnen eigenen wissenschaftlichen Offenheit
jederzeit bereit, neue Gebiete in das inhaltliche Spektrum der
Zeitschrift für Metallkunde zu integrieren.
Es ıst Ihr Grundsatz, daß allein der 65. Geburtstag Anlaß
für eine Laudatio in der Zeitschrift für Metallkunde sein
möge. Wir folgen Ihrem Willen: Ihr wissenschaftliches Le-
benswerk und Ihr Wirken als Mentor einer Generation von
Materialforschern
ist ın früheren Ausgaben dieser Zeit-
schrift gewürdigt worden. Es ist der Wunsch und die Hoff-
nung der Kollegen der Schriftleitung und der Redaktion,
daß Sie noch weit über diesen runden Geburtstag hinaus
die Arbeit für dıe Zeitschrift Metallkunde leiten und mit
Ihrer unverwechselbaren Handschrift prägen werden.
Herzlichen Glückwunsch!
Ihre Kollegen der Schriftleitung, die Redaktion
Z. Metallkd. 87 (1996) 7
