The Emergence, Complexity and Computation (ECC) series publishes new
developments, advancements and selected topics in the ﬁelds of complexity,
computation and emergence. The series focuses on all aspects of reality-based
computation approaches from an interdisciplinary point of view especially from
applied sciences, biology, physics, or chemistry. It presents new ideas and
interdisciplinary insight on the mutual intersection of subareas of computation,
complexity and emergence and its impact and limits to any computing based on
physical limits (thermodynamic and quantum limits, Bremermann’s limit, Seth
Lloyd limits…) as well as algorithmic limits (Gödel’s proof and its impact on
calculation, algorithmic complexity, the Chaitin’s Omega number and Kolmogorov
complexity, non-traditional calculations like Turing machine process and its
consequences,…) and limitations arising in artiﬁcial intelligence. The topics are
(but not limited to) membrane computing, DNA computing, immune computing,
quantum computing, swarm computing, analogic computing, chaos computing and
computing on the edge of chaos, computational aspects of dynamics of complex
systems (systems with self-organization, multiagent systems, cellular automata,
artiﬁcial life,…), emergence of complex systems and its computational aspects, and
agent based computation. The main aim of this series is to discuss the above
mentioned topics from an interdisciplinary point of view and present new ideas
coming from mutual intersection of classical as well as modern methods of
computation. Within the scope of the series are monographs, lecture notes, selected
contributions from specialized conferences and workshops, special contribution
from international experts.

Preface
In this book, we continue the investigations of global attractors and invariant sets
for dynamical systems by means of Lyapunov functions and adapted metrics. The
effectiveness of such approaches for the approximation and localization of attractors
for different classes of dynamical systems was already shown in Abramovich et al.
[1, 2] and in [30, 32]. In particular, Lyapunov functions and adapted metrics were
constructed for global stability problems and the existence of homoclinic orbits in
the Lorenz system using frequency-domain methods and reduction principles.
In 1980, investigators of differential equations and general dynamical systems
were greatly impressed by a paper about upper estimates of the Hausdorff dimen-
sion of ﬂow and map invariant sets written by Douady and Oesterlé [12]. The
Douady–Oesterlé approach, the signiﬁcance of which can be compared with that of
Liouville’s theorem, has been developed and modiﬁcated in many papers for var-
ious types of dimension characteristics of attractors generated by dynamical sys-
tems: Ledrappier [22], Constantin et al. [11], Smith [42], Eden et al. [13], Chen [9],
Hunt [17], Boichenko and Leonov [4].
After Ya. B. Pesin had worked out [39] a general scheme of introducing metric
dimension characteristics, this method made it possible to deﬁne from a unique
point of view various types of outer measures and dimensions, such as the
Hausdorff dimension, the fractal dimension, the information dimension as well as
the topological and metric entropies. The Pesin scheme naturally led to the char-
acterization of a class of Carathéodory measures [25, 27], which are adapted to the
speciﬁc character of attractors of autonomous differential equations, i.e. to the fact
that these attractors consist wholly of trajectories. The neighborhoods of pieces
of these trajectories form a covering of the attractor. It serves as the base for
introducing the special outer Carathéodory measures. A number of effective tools
for estimating these measures were developed within the theory of differential
equations in Euclidean space and well-known results by Borg [8], Hartman and
Olech [15], when analysing the orbital stability of solutions. The most important
property, used in dimension theory, is the fact that the Carathéodory measures are
majorants for the associated Hausdorff measures.
v

Early in the nineties of the last century, G. A. Leonov and his co-workers
observed deep inner connections between the mentioned direct method of
Lyapunov in stability theory and estimation technics for outer measures in
dimension theory. Introducing the Lyapunov functions and varying Riemannian
metrices (Leonov [24], Noack and Reitmann [38]) into upper estimates of dimen-
sion characteristics of invariant sets made it possible to generalize and improve
[4, 6, 28, 29] some well-known results of R. A. Smith, P. Constantin, C. Foias,
A. Eden, and R. Temam.
On the other hand, Pugh’s closing lemma [40] and theorems about the spanning
of two-dimensional surfaces on a given closed curve gave the opportunity to apply
some theorems about the contraction of Hausdorff measures to global stability
investigations of time-continuous dynamical systems (Smith [42], Leonov [24], Li
and Muldowney [35]). In this book, the effectiveness of introducing the Lyapunov
functions into dimensional characteristics is shown for a number of concrete
dynamical systems: the Hénon map, the systems of Lorenz and Rössler as well as
their generalizations for various physical systems and models (rotation of a rigid
body in a resisting medium, convection of liquid in a rotating ellipsoid, interaction
between waves in plasma, etc.).
Additionally to the derivation of upper Hausdorff dimension estimates, exact
formulas for the Lyapunov dimensions for Lorenz type systems were shown
[26, 28]. Many of these results were presented in [7].
In the following decade, the modiﬁed Douady–Oesterlé approach was also used
for new classes of attractors [33].
It was also possible to get different versions of the Douady–Oesterlé theorem for
piecewise continuous maps and differential equations [37, 41]. For cocycles gen-
erated by non-autonomous systems, the upper Hausdorff dimension estimates are
derived in [31, 34]. Some of these results are included in the present book which
provides a systematic presentation of research activities in the dimension theory of
dynamical systems in ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and manifolds. Let us
brieﬂy sketch the contents of the book.
In Part I, we consider the basic facts from attractor theory, exterior products and
dimension theory. Chapter 1 is devoted to the investigation of various types of
global attractors of dynamical systems in general metric spaces (global B-attractors,
minimal global B-attractors and others). The theoretical results are applied to the
generalized Lorenz system and dynamical systems on the ﬂat cylinder. One section
is concerned with the existence proof of a homoclinic orbit in the Lorenz system
(Leonov [23], Hastings and Troy [16], Chen [10]).
In Chap. 2, some facts on singular values of matrices, the exterior calculus for
spaces and matrices and the Lozinskii matrix norm, necessary for estimation
techniques of outer measures, are presented. In addition to this, the Yakubovich–
Kalman frequency theorem and the Kalman–Szegö theorem about the solvability of
certain matrix inequalities are formulated and used for the estimation of singular
values.

Preface

Chapter 3 is an introduction to dimension theory. It starts with the deﬁnition and
the basic properties of the topological dimension in the spirit of Hurewicz and
Wallman [18]. Next, the notions of Hausdorff measure, Hausdorff dimension and
fractal dimension are introduced. After this, the topological entropy of a continuous
map is discussed. The last part of the chapter deals with Pesin’s scheme of intro-
ducing the Carathéodory dimension characteristics.
In Part II, we investigate dimension properties of dynamical systems in
Euclidean spaces. It includes estimates of topological dimension of the Hausdorff
and fractal dimensions for invariant sets of concrete physical systems and estimates
of the Lyapunov dimension.
Chapter 4 is concerned with the investigation of dimension properties of almost
periodic ﬂows [3]. We thank M. M. Anikushin for helping us to prepare the ﬁrst
version of Chap. 4.
Chapter 5 begins with the so-called limit theorem about the evolution of
Hausdorff measures under the action of smooth maps in Euclidean spaces. This
theorem gives the opportunity to include into Hausdorff dimension and Hausdorff
measure estimates, certain varying functions which turn over into Lyapunov
functions when the theorem is applied to differential equations. The method of
varying functions is used in estimations of fractal dimension and topological
entropy. Simultaneously, with the introduction of Lyapunov functions in estimates
for the Hausdorff measure, the logarithmic norms were used by Muldowney [36],
for estimating the two-dimensional Riemannian volumes of compact sets shifted
along the orbits of differential equations. One of the main goals of Chap. 5 is to
combine the Lyapunov function and logarithmic norm approaches (Boichenko and
Leonov [5]), in order to solve a number of problems in the qualitative theory of
ordinary differential equations, such as the generalization of the Liouville formula
and the Bendixson criterion.
Chapter 6 is devoted to ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical systems in Euclidean space
and its aim is to explain, in a simple but rigorous way, the connection between the
key works in the area: Kaplan and Yorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension [19]
1979), Douady and Oesterlé (estimation of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov
dimension of maps [12]), Constantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (estimation of
Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension of
dynamical systems [13]), Leonov (estimation of the Lyapunov dimension via the
direct Lyapunov method [20, 24]), and numerical methods for the computation of
Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension [21]. We also concentrate in this
chapter on the Kaplan–Yorke formula and the Lyapunov dimension formulas for
the Lorenz and Hénon attractors (Leonov [26]).
In Part III, we consider dimension properties for dynamical systems on mani-
folds. Chapter 7 gives a presentation of the exterior calculus in general linear
spaces. It contains also some results about orbital stability for vector ﬁelds on
manifolds.
Chapter 8 is devoted to dimension estimates of invariant sets and attractors of
dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds. The Douady–Oesterlé theorem for
the upper Hausdorff dimension estimates for invariant sets of smooth dynamical

systems on Riemannian manifolds is proved. Chapter 8 contains also an important
result on the estimation of the fractal dimension of an invariant set on an arbitrary
ﬁnite-dimensional smooth manifold by the upper Lyapunov dimension, which goes
back to Hunt [17], Gelfert [14]. Then we discuss the construction of the special
Carathéodory measures for the estimation of Hausdorff measures connected with
ﬂow invariant sets on Riemannian manifolds.
In Chap. 9, we derive dimension and entropy estimates for invariant sets and
global B-attractors of cocycles. A version of the Douady–Oesterlé theorem (Leonov
et al. [31]) is proved for local cocycles in a Euclidean space and for cocycles on
Riemannian manifolds. As examples, we consider cocycles, generated by the
Rössler system with variable coefﬁcients. We also introduce time-discrete cocycles
on ﬁbered spaces and deﬁne the topological entropy of such cocycles. We thank
A. O. Romanov for helping us to prepare this chapter.
In Chap. 10, we derive some versions of the Douady–Oesterlé theorem for
systems with singularities. In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we consider a special
class of non-injective maps, for which we introduce a factor describing the “degree
of non-injectivity” (Boichenko et al. [6]). This factor can be included in the
dimension estimates of Chap. 8 in order to weaken the condition to the singular
value function. In the second part of Chap. 10, we derive the upper Hausdorff
dimension estimates for invariant sets of a class of not necessarily invertible and
piecewise smooth maps on manifolds with controllable preimages of the
non-differentiability sets in terms of the singular values of the derivative of the
smoothly extended map (Reitmann and Schnabel [41], Neunhäuserer [37]) These
estimates generalize some Douady–Oesterlé type results for differentiable maps in a
Euclidean space, derived in Chaps. 5 and 8.
In the last section of Chap. 10, we discuss some classes of functionals which are
useful for the estimation of topological and metric dimensions.

Chapter 1
Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Abstract The main tool in estimating dimensions of invariant sets and entropies
of dynamical systems developed in this book is based on Lyapunov functions. In
this chapter we introduce the basic concept of global attractors. The existence of a
global attractor for a dynamical system follows from the dissipativity of the system.
In order to show the last property we use Lyapunov functions. In this chapter we
also consider some applications of Lyapunov functions to stability problems of the
Lorenz system. A central result is the existence of homoclinic orbits in the Lorenz

1.1.1
Dynamical Systems in Metric Spaces
Suppose that (M, ρ) is a complete metric space. Let T be one of the sets R, R+, Z or
Z+. A map ϕ(·)(·) : T × M →M resp. a triple ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is called a dynamical
system on (M, ρ) if the following conditions are satisﬁed ([2, 11]):
(1) ϕ0(u) = u ,
∀u ∈M ;
(2) ϕt+s(u) = ϕt(ϕs(u)) ,
∀t, s ∈T,
∀u ∈M ;
(3) If T ∈{R, R+} the map (t, u) ∈T × M →ϕt(u) is continuous;
if T ∈{Z, Z+} the map u ∈M →ϕt(u) is continuous on M for any t ∈T.
If the metric space (M, ρ) is ﬁxed we denote the dynamical system shortly by
{ϕt}t∈T. The sets T and M are called time sets and phase space, respectively. The
dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) forms a group, if T ∈{R, Z}, and a semi-group if
T ∈{R+, Z+}. If T ∈{R, R+} we say that the dynamical system is with continuous
time, if T ∈{Z, Z+} we say that the system is with discrete time. A dynamical system
({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is called ﬂow if T = R, semi-ﬂow if T = R+, and cascade if T = Z.

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Example 1.1 Consider the autonomous differential equation
˙ϕ = f (ϕ) ,
(1.1)
where f : Rn →Rn is assumed to be locally Lipschitz. The Euclidean norm in Rn
is denoted by | · |. Suppose also that any maximal solution ϕ(·, u) of (1.1) starting
in u at t = 0 exists for any t ∈R. Let now ϕt(·) ≡ϕ(t, ·) : Rn →Rn be the time
t-map of (1.1). Clearly, that by the solution properties of (1.1) (uniqueness theo-
rem and theorem of continuous dependence on initial condition, [12, 34]) the triple
({ϕt}t∈R, Rn, | · |) deﬁnes a dynamical system with the additive group T = R, i.e. a
ﬂow.
Example 1.2 Assume that
˙ϕ = f (t, ϕ)
(1.2)
is a non-autonomous differential equation with f : R × Rn →Rn. Let us suppose
that f is continuously differentiable, T -periodic in the ﬁrst argument and that any
solution exists on R. Denote the solution of (1.2) starting in u at t = t0 by ϕ(·, t0, u).
Again by the uniqueness theorem and the theorem of continuous dependence of
solutions on initial conditions for ODE’s it follows that the family of maps ϕm(·) ≡
ϕ(m T, 0, ·), m ∈Z, deﬁnes a dynamical system ({ϕm}m∈Z, Rn, | · |) which is a cas-
cade. Let us demonstrate this. Clearly, ϕ0(u) = ϕ(0, 0, u) = u, ∀u ∈Rn. In order to
show the property (2) of a dynamical system we consider arbitrary m, k ∈Z. Deﬁne
the two functions c1(t) := ϕ(t, 0, ϕ(mT, 0, u)) and c2(t) := ϕ(t + mT, 0, u). From
the T -periodicity of f in the ﬁrst variable it follows that c2 is also a solution of (1.2)
on R, i.e.
˙c2(t) = f (t + mT, ϕ(t + mT, 0, u)) = f (t, c2(t)).
Since c2(0) = ϕ(mT, 0, u), it follows by the uniqueness theorems that
c1(t) = c2(t), ∀t ∈R.
If we put t = kT , the last property results in c1(kT ) ≡ϕk(ϕm(u)) = c2(kT ) ≡
ϕk+m(u).
Example 1.3 Suppose that
ϕ : M →M
(1.3)
is a continuous invertible map on the complete metric space (M, ρ). Let us deﬁne
the family of maps
ϕm :=

1.1 Dynamical Systems, Limit Sets and Attractors

Using well-known properties of the composition of continuous invertible maps, i.e.
of homeomorphisms, it is easy to show that the properties (1)–(3) of a dynamical
system with the additive group T = Z are satisﬁed. This means that (1.4) deﬁnes a
cascade.
Example 1.4 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian n-dimensional Ck-manifold
(k ≥2), F : M →T M a C2-vector ﬁeld (see Sect. A.6, Appendix A). Consider
the corresponding differential equation
˙ϕ = F(ϕ) .
(1.5)
Assume that any maximal integral curve ϕ(·, u) of (1.5) satisfying ϕ(0, u) = u exists
on R. Deﬁne ϕ(·)(u) := ϕ(·, u) and denote with ρ the metric generated by the metric
tensor g. Then ({ϕt}t∈R, M, ρ) is a ﬂow deﬁned by the vector ﬁeld (1.5).
Instead of (1.5) we can consider a C1-diffeomorphism
ϕ : M →M .
(1.6)
It is clear that (1.6) generates the dynamical system ({ϕm}m∈Z, M, ρ) .
Example 1.5 Suppose that Ω+
2 :=

ω = (ω 0, ω1, . . .) | ωi ∈{0, 1}

is the set of all
one-sided inﬁnite sequences of the symbols 0 and 1. The metric on Ω+
2 is given by
ρ(ω, ω′) :=
∞

i=0
2−i | ωi −ω′
i | ,
where ω = (ω 0, ω1, . . .) and ω′ = (ω′
0, ω′
1, . . .) are from Ω+
2 . It is easy to see that
ρ is really a metric and (Ω+
2 , ρ) is a complete metric space.
Deﬁne the (left) shift map ϑ : Ω+
2 →Ω+
2 by
ϑ(ω) = (ω1, ω2, . . .) for ω = (ω 0, ω1, . . .) ∈Ω+
2 .
The map ϑ is continuous since for arbitrary ω, ω′ ∈Ω+
2 we have
ρ(ϑ(ω), ϑ(ω′)) =

It follows that

is a dynamical system with discrete time.
Let us deﬁne now some properties of a dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ). For an
arbitrary ﬁxed u ∈M, the map t →ϕt(u), t ∈T deﬁnes a motion of the dynamical
system starting from u at time t = 0. For any u ∈M the set γ (u) := 
t∈T ϕt(u)

is the orbit through u. If T ∈{R, Z} we consider also the positive and the negative
semi-orbit through u deﬁned by
γ +(u) :=

t∈T∩R+
ϕt(u) resp. γ −(u) :=

t∈T∩R−
ϕt(u) .
An orbit γ (u) is called stationary, critical or an equilibrium if γ (u) = {u}. The orbit
γ (u)ofadynamicalsystemiscalled T -periodicwithperiod T if T > 0 isthesmallest
positive number in T such that ϕt(u) = ϕt+T (u), ∀t ∈T. A set Z ⊂M is said to be
positively invariant if ϕt(Z) ⊂Z, ∀t ∈T ∩R+, invariant if ϕt(Z) = Z, ∀t ∈T,
and negatively invariant, if ϕt(Z) ⊃Z, ∀t ∈T ∩R+. The positively invariant set
Z of the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is said to be stable if in any neighborhood
U of Z there exists a neighborhood U′ such that ϕt(U′) ⊂U, ∀t ∈T+. Z is called
asymptotically stable if it is stable and ϕt(u) →Z as t →+∞for each u ∈U′.
The set Z is said to be globally asymptotically stable if Z is stable and ϕt(u) →Z
as t →+∞for each u ∈M. The set Z is called uniformly asymptotically stable if
it is stable and limt→+∞{dist(ϕt(u), Z) | u ∈U′} = 0.
For any u ∈M the ω-limit set of u under {ϕt}t∈T is the set
ω(u) := {υ ∈M | ∃{tn}n∈N , tn ∈T , tn →+∞, ϕtn(u) →υ
for n →+∞} .
For a subset Z ⊂M we deﬁne its ω-limit set ω(Z) under {ϕt}t∈T as the set of the
limits of all converging sequences of the form ϕtn(un), where un ∈Z, tn ∈T, and
tn →+∞.
Example 1.6 Consider a class of modiﬁed horseshoe maps ϕ which are deﬁned
on an open neighborhood U = (−δ, 1 + δ) × (−δ, 1 + δ) ⊂R2 of the unit square
C = [0, 1] × [0, 1], where δ > 0 is a sufﬁciently small number. The map is deﬁned
for points (x, y) ∈C in such a way that it ﬁrst contracts C horizontally with a factor
α < 1
2 and stretches it vertically with a function f , then it is folded along a horizontal
line such that the vertical edge of the resulting rectangle is greater than 2, and ﬁnally
it is formed into an horseshoe (see Fig.1.1) in such a way that the map can be con-
tinuously extended to U and is continuously differentiable on an open neighborhood

U of K = ∞
i=−∞ϕi(C) , where ϕi(·) for negative numbers i means the preimage
under the map ϕ−i.
For example we take α = 1
3 and let the function f stretch C with factor β1 = 3,
if y ≤51
65 =: h, with a factor β2 between 3 and 5, if 51
65 < y < 4
5 and with factor 5,
if y ≥4
5, the resulting rectangle is folded on the image of the line y = 51
65 and then
it is formed to an horseshoe in such a way, that the map satisﬁes

Fig. 1.1 Modiﬁed horseshoe map
The set K = ∞
i=−∞ϕi(C) is invariant under the map. Therefore if we take 
K = K,
then ϕ j(K) ⊂
K is satisﬁed for any j = 1, 2, . . . . The set K can be constructed step
by step starting with K0 = C. At every step i > 1 we get Ki := Ki−1 ∩ϕ(Ki−1) ∩
ϕ−1(Ki−1) and in the limit the invariant set K as K = ∞
i=0 Ki. The set Ki consists
of 6i rectangles where the lengths of the edges are horizontally 1
3i and vertically 1
3i
and 1
5i , respectively (see Fig.1.1).
It is easy to verify that the following proposition is true ([4, 7, 38]).
Proposition 1.1 For any subset Z ⊂M the ω-limit set under {ϕt}t∈T is given by
ω(Z) =

s≥0
s∈T

t≥s
t∈T
ϕt(Z) .
Here for a set Z ⊂M we denote by Z its closure in the topology of the metric
space (M, ρ).
If T ∈{R, Z} we also consider the α-limit set of a point u ∈M under {ϕt}t∈T
deﬁned by
α(u) := {υ ∈M | ∃{tn}n∈N , tn ∈T, tn →−∞, ϕtn(u) →υ
for n →+∞}
and the α-limit set ω(Z) of a set Z ⊂M under {ϕt}t∈T given as the set of the limits of
all converging sequences of the form ϕtn(un), where pn ∈Z, tn ∈T, and tn →−∞.
A set Zmin ⊂M is called minimal for ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) if it is closed, invariant, and
does not have any proper subset with the same properties. The following proposition
is taken from [33, 36].
Proposition 1.2 Suppose that Z ⊂M is non-empty, compact and invariant for
({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ). Then Z contains a minimal set Zmin.
Proof (For the case that T is a semi-group). If Z has no proper subset, which is
closed and invariant, then Z is minimal, and the proposition is proved.

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Suppose that there exists Z1 ⊂Z, Z1 ̸= Z, such that Z1 is closed and invariant.
If Z1 contains no proper subset being closed and invariant, then it is minimal.
Suppose again that there exists a closed invariant set Z2 ⊂Z1 with Z2 ̸= Z1. If
we can continue this process and at any step we obtain a new minimal set Zi, we get
the sequence of closed invariant sets
Z0 := Z ⊃Z1 ⊃Z2 ⊃· · · .
The intersection of these sets Zω := ∞
i=0 Zi is non-empty and compact. Let us show
that Zω is invariant. Suppose that u ∈Zω is arbitrary. Then for any integer k ≥0
we have u ∈Zk. It follows that ϕt(u) ∈Zk , t ≥0, for any k. But this means that
ϕt(u) ∈Zω and, consequently, Zω ⊂ϕt(Zω). The inverse inclusion can be proved
analogously. Thus the set Zω is invariant.
If the set Zω is not minimal then there exists a closed and invariant set Zω+1 ⊂Zω
with Zω+1 ̸= Zω. If we can continue this process and if β is the transﬁnite limit
number for which the sets Zα are constructed for all α < β, we put
Zβ :=

α<β
Zα .
Clearly, the set Zβ is closed and invariant. Thus we get the transﬁnite sequence of
sets
Z ⊃Z1 ⊃· · · ⊃Zk ⊃· · · ⊃Zω ⊃· · · ⊃Zβ ⊃· · · .
According to the Baire-Hausdorff theorem ([16], Theorem A.14.1) there exists a
transﬁnite number β of the second class such that Zβ = Zβ+1, i.e. the set Zβ has no
proper closed and invariant subset. Consequently, Zβ is a minimal set.
□
The next result follows immediately from Proposition 1.2.
Proposition 1.3 Suppose that the positive semi-orbit of ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) , starting
in p, is relatively compact. Then ω(p) contains a minimal set.
Some important properties of ω-limit sets are proved in the next proposition ([18]).
Proposition 1.4 Let ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) be a dynamical system with a semi-group as
time set and let Z ⊂M be a non-empty set such that for some t0 > 0, t0 ∈T, the
set

t≥t0,t∈T
ϕt(Z) is relatively compact.
Then ω(Z) is non-empty, compact and invariant. Furthermore, ω(Z) is a minimal
closed set which attracts Z.
Proof Recall that relative compactness of a set means that the closure of this set
is compact. Since Z ̸= ∅the sets Bs =

t≥s,t∈T
ϕt(Z) are non-empty for all s ≥0,
s ∈T. Consequently, the sets Bs are non-empty compact sets for s ≥t0 and Bs1 ⊂Bs2

1.1 Dynamical Systems, Limit Sets and Attractors

for all s1 ≥s2 in T. Therefore ω(Z) =

s≥0,s∈T
Bs is a non-empty compact set and
attracts Z.
If u ∈ϕt(ω(Z)) then for a certain υ ∈ω(Z) we have u = ϕt(υ). Hence there
exists a sequence um ∈Z and a sequence {tm}, tm ∈T, tm →+∞as m →+∞,
such that limm→+∞ϕt(ϕtm(u)) = limm→+∞ϕt+tm(um) = ϕt(υ) = u. But this means
that u ∈ω(Z).
Let us prove the reverse inclusion. If υ ∈ω(Z) a sequence um ∈Z and a sequence
{tm}fromTexistsuchthattm →+∞asm →+∞, 1 + t0 + t ≤t1 < t2 < · · · ,and
ϕtm(um) →υ
for m →+∞.
(1.7)
For tm ≥t the sequence ϕtm−t(um) belongs to the relatively compact set

t≥t0+1,
t∈T
ϕt(Z). Consequently, passing if necessary to a subsequence, we may sup-
pose that there exists a point u ∈M such that
ϕtm−t(um) →u
as m →+∞.
But this means that u ∈ω(Z). Since
ϕtm(um) = ϕt(ϕtm−t(um)) →ϕt(u) as m →+∞,
by (1.7) we have υ = ϕt(u). Thus, υ ∈ϕt(ω(Z)).
It remains to show that ω(Z) is a minimal closed set which attracts Z. Let us
argue as in [18]. Suppose the contrary and let C be a proper closed subset of ω(Z)
which attracts Z. As ω(Z) is compact so is C. Choose any υ ∈ω(Z) \C. For ε >
0 small enough the ε-neighborhoods Uε(υ) and Uε(C) do not intersect. Since C
attracts Z there is a t = t(ε) ≥0 such that ϕt(Z) ⊂Uε(C), ∀t ≥t(ε). On the other
hand since υ ∈ω(Z), υ = limk→∞ϕtk(uk) for some uk ∈Z and tk →+∞is a
sequence. Consequently, ϕtk(Z) ∩Uε(υ) ̸= ∅for sufﬁciently large tk. Hence Uε(υ)
∩Uε(C) ̸= ∅, a contradiction.
□
Assume that ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system with a group as time set and
u ∈M is an arbitrary point. The sets
W s(u) := {υ ∈M| lim
t→+∞ϕt(υ) = u}
and
W u(u) := {υ ∈M| lim
t→−∞ϕt(υ) = u}
are called stable and unstable manifold, respectively, in u. Since the orbits are invari-
ant, the sets W s(u) and W u(u) are also invariant. Suppose that u and υ are equilibria
of the dynamical system. Then any orbit which is contained in W s(u) ∩W u(υ) is
called heteroclinic if u ̸= υ, and homoclinic if u = υ.

1.1.2
Minimal Global Attractors
Now we come to some of the basic deﬁnitions in our book. For arbitrary nonempty
sets Z1, Z2 ⊂M we deﬁne dist(Z1, Z2) := sup
u∈Z1
inf
υ∈Z2 ρ(u, υ). By Uε(Z) we denote
the ε-neighborhood of a set Z, i.e. Uε(Z) := {υ ∈M | dist (υ, Z) < ε}.
Deﬁnition 1.1 Suppose that ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system.
(1) We say that a set Z0 ⊂M attracts the set Z ⊂M if for any ε > 0 there exists
a t0 = t0(ε, Z) such that for all t ≥t0, t ∈T, we have ϕt(Z) ⊂Uε(Z0).
(2) An attractor A for ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a non-empty closed and invariant set which
attracts all points from some set Z with a non-empty interior. The largest set with
non-empty interior which is attracted by A is called the domain of attraction.
(3) A global attractor for ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a non-empty, closed and invariant set
which attracts all points of M.
(4) A global B-attractor is a non-empty, closed and invariant set which attracts any
bounded set B of M.
(5) A minimal global attractor (minimal global B-attractor) is a global attractor
(global B-attractor) which is a minimal set among all global attractors (global
B-attractors).
(6) A set Z0 ⊂M is said to be B-absorbing for ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) if for any bounded
set B in M there exists a t0 = t0(B) such that ϕt(B) ⊂Z0 for any t ≥t0, t ∈T.
(7) A dynamical system is said to be pointwise dissipative (B-dissipative) if it pos-
sesses a pointwise absorbing (B-absorbing set) B0. The set B0 is called region
of pointwise dissipativity (of B-dissipativity).
(8) A set Z0 ⊂M is said to be pointwise absorbing for ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) if for any
u ∈M there exists a t0 = t0(u) such that ϕt(u) ⊂Z0 for any t ≥t0, t ∈T.
Let us use the following abbreviations for the attractors of a dynamical system
({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ): A—an arbitrary attractor, AM—a global B-attractor, AM,min—
a minimal global B-attractor, 
AM—a global attractor, 
AM,min—a minimal global
attractor.
A direct consequence of Deﬁnition 1.1 is the following proposition.

1.1 Dynamical Systems, Limit Sets and Attractors
11
Proposition 1.5 Let A be a global B-attractor and ε > 0 an arbitrary number. Then
the ε-neighborhood of A is B-absorbing for the dynamical system.
Remark 1.1 Minimal global attractors and B-attractors where introduced by
O.A. Ladyzhenskaya in [18]. Our Deﬁnition 1.1 follows the representation given
in [18]. Important properties of minimal global attractors are also derived in [6, 7,
15, 35, 37].
The existence of a global B-attractor is shown in the next proposition ([17]).
Note that if a global B-attractor exists, then it contains a minimal global B-
attractor.
Proposition 1.6 Suppose that the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is
B-dissipative according to the bounded B-absorbing set B0 and there exists a t0 > 0
such that the set

t≥t0,t∈T
ϕt(B0) is relatively compact. Then
AM,min := {ω(B) | B ⊂M, B bounded}
is a minimal global B-attractor and

AM,min :=

u∈M
ω(u)
is a minimal global attractor of the dynamical system.
Proof Since by Proposition 1.4 every bounded set B ⊂M is attracted to its ω-
limit set ω(B) and to AM,min, it is attracted to ω(B) ∩AM,min. Since ω(B) is
minimal, it lies in AM,min. The set AM,min, is invariant and minimal. It follows that
ω(AM,min) = AM,min and the representation for AM,min, is shown.
The fact that 
u∈M ω(u) is a minimal global attractor follows from the properties
of an ω-limit set.
□
Remark 1.2 In contrast to the minimal global attractor given by Proposition 1.6 a
minimal global attractor can be unbounded. The dynamical system generated by the
ODE
˙x = 0 ,
˙y = −ay ,
a > 0
has as a minimal global B-attractor AR2,min the x-axis (see Sect. 2.1, Chap. 2)
Other examples of minimal global attractors and global B-attractors will be con-
sidered in the sequel.
A dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is called locally completely continuous if
for any u ∈M there exists a δ = δ(u) > 0 and an l = l(u) > 0,l(u) ∈T+, such
that ϕl(Bδ(u)) is relatively compact. It is clear that a dynamical system given in a
locally compact space is locally completely continuous.
The next proposition is a result of [4].

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Proposition 1.7 For a locally completely continuous dynamical system pointwise
dissipativity and B-dissipativity are equivalent.
Proof We have to show that a dynamical system which is pointwise dissipative is
also B-dissipative. From the pointwise dissipativity it follows that there exists a
non-empty compact set 
K ⊂M such that for each ε > 0 and u ∈M there exists a
δ(u) > 0 and a τ(ε, u) such that
dist (ϕt(υ), 
K) < ε
(1.8)
for all t ≥τ(ε, u), t ∈T, and all υ ∈Bδ(u)(u). Suppose B is an arbitrary bounded set
whichis containedinacompact setK. Thenfor anyu ∈K thereexists aδ = δ(u) > 0
and τ = τ(ε, u) > 0 such that (1.8) is satisﬁed. Consider an open cover {Bδ(u)(u)}u∈K
of K. Since K is compact and M is a complete metric space there is a ﬁnite subcover
{Bδ(ui)(ui)}m
i=1 of K.
Deﬁne ˜l(ε, K) := max{τ(ε, ui)|i = 1, . . . , m}. Then it follows from (1.8) that
dist (ϕt(K), K) < ε, ∀t > ˜l(ε, K).
□
Since for dynamical systems in locally compact metric spaces pointwise dissipa-
tivity and B-dissipativity are equivalent we call these properties shortly dissipativity.
The next proposition is proved in [7]. It shows that Lyapunov functions can give
a good inside in the structure of an attractor.
In this book the term Lyapunov function for a dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ)
means a scalar valued continuous function V which is considered along the orbits
and whose properties allow some conclusions about the qualitative behaviour of the
dynamical system. If M is a manifold and V is differentiable the properties of V
depend on the Lie derivative of V w.r.t. the dynamical system (see Subsect. 1.2.3).
Proposition 1.8 Suppose for the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) with a group as
time set there exists a compact global B-attractor AM and a continuous function
V : M →R with the following properties:
(1)Foranyu ∈Mthefunction V (ϕt(u))isnon-increasingwithrespecttot ∈T+;
(2) If for some t0 > 0, t0 ∈T+, the equation V (u) = V (ϕt0(u)) holds, then u is
an equilibrium of the dynamical system.
Then: (a) AM = W u(C), where C is the set of equilibrium points of the dynamical
system.
(b) The global minimal attractor 
AM,min of the dynamical system is C.
Remark 1.3 Suppose ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system with a group as time

is the set of equilibria of the dynamical system. For a proof see [7].
For dynamical systems ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) given on a Riemannian smooth n-dimen-

If the manifold is compact we deﬁne the minimal global Milnor attractor as a
minimal closed invariant set A having the property limt→∞dist(ϕt(u), A) = 0 for
any u ∈S, where S is a Lebesgue measurable set with the full Lebesgue measure,
i.e. μL(S) = μL(M).
In the following we denote a Milnor attractor by 
A and a minimal global Milnor
attractor by 
Amin.
We will consider the minimal global Milnor attractor also for dynamical systems
given in Rn and possessing a bounded open positively invariant absorbing set B0. In
this case we can restrict our system on the positive semi-group T+ on B0, considering
B0 with relative topology as compact manifold.
Example 1.7 Let us consider Van der Pol’s equation
¨x + ε(x2 −1)˙x + x = 0
where ε > 0 is a parameter. This equation can be written as planar system
˙x = y ,
˙y = −ε(x2 −1)y −x .
(1.9)
It is well-known that (1.9) generates a semi-ﬂow ({ϕt}t≥0, R2, | · |) and the origin
(0, 0) is an unstable equilibrium of this semi-ﬂow. Furthermore, there is a single
orbitally stable periodic orbit (Fig.1.2). Any orbit of the semi-ﬂow, different from
the equilibrium (0, 0), tends for t →+∞to this periodic orbit.
It is easy to see that the minimal global B-attractor is AR2,min is the closed disk

Consider the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, (M, ρ)) on the metric space (M, ρ).
Suppose B = B(M) is the σ-algebra of Borel sets on M and μ is a ﬁnite
Borel measure on B, i.e., μ(M) < +∞. The bounded set 
Aμ(M) ⊂M is called
global Milnor attractor w.r.t. the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, (M, ρ)) and the
measure μ if 
Aμ(M) is a minimal, closed and invariant set having the property

Aμ(M)) for μ-a.e. point u ∈M. Sometimes the global Milnor
attractor is called stochastic attractor.

Suppose that M = E is a linear metric space and E∗is the dual to E, i.e., the linear
space of linear bounded functionals on E. The sequence {un}∞
n=1 from E is called
weakly convergent to u ∈E if ℓ(un) →ℓ(u) , ∀ℓ∈E∗. We denote this by un ⇀u
for n →∞. The set Z ⊂E is called weakly closed if it contains the weak limit u
of arbitrary weakly convergent sequences {un} ⊂Z. In the weak topology the open
sets are given by arbitrary unions of sets
O(υ; ℓ1, ℓ2, . . . , ℓn; ε1, ε2, . . . , εn)

where υ ∈E , ℓi ∈E∗, εi > 0 (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are numbers.
By deﬁnition the empty set ∅is open.
A non-empty set O which is open in the weak topology and which contains the
set Z ⊂E is called weak neighborhood of Z.
Suppose that M = E is a linear metric space. The set Aw(M) ⊂M is called
weak global B-attractor w.r.t. ({ϕt}t∈T, (E, ρ)) if Aw(M) is a bounded and weakly
closed invariant set such that for any weak neighborhood O of the set Aw(M) and
any bounded set B ⊂M there exists a t0 = t0(O, B) such that ϕt(B) ⊂O for all
t ≥t0.
Let us note that if the linear space M = E has ﬁnite dimension and for the
dynamical system the global attractor AM exists and is weakly closed then also
exists Aw(M) and Aw(M) = AM.
In Table1.1 we present the various types of attractors and their symbols.
Example 1.8 Let us consider as complete metric space M the Hilbert space

Dissipativity
1.2.1
Dissipativity in the Sense of Levinson
This section is devoted to the concepts of dissipativity, region of dissipativity, and
its estimation for autonomous differential equations. These notions arose for the
ﬁrst time in stability theory. Later they turned out to be very useful in the study of
attractors since they give the possibility to localize attractors in the phase space.
Consider the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, Rn, | · |) which in the continuous-time
case is given by the autonomous ODE
˙ϕ = f (ϕ) ,
(1.10)
where f : Rn →Rn is continuously differentiable, and in the discrete-time case is
given by the continuous map
ϕ : Rn →Rn .
(1.11)
Deﬁnition 1.2 The dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, Rn, | · |) is called dissipative in the
sense of Levinson, if there exists an R > 0 such that for any u ∈Rn
lim sup
t→+∞
|ϕt(u)| < R .

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Proposition 1.9 The dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, Rn, | · |) is dissipative in the sense
of Levinson if and only if there exists a bounded set D ⊂Rn that attracts any point
in Rn.
Proof Let the dynamical system be dissipative in the sense of Levinson. Choose as
the set D a ball of radius R, where R is from Deﬁnition 1.2, and with center in the
origin. It is obvious that such a D attracts every point in Rn.
Conversely, let D be a set for the dynamical system which attracts every point of
Rn, and let ε > 0 be an arbitrary number. Choose R so large that the ball of radius R
with center in the origin contains the ε-neighborhood Dε of D. It is clear that such
an R satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1.2.

It is easy to see that if the dynamical system is dissipative in the sense of Levinson

the inclusion A ⊂D.

Dissipativity and Completeness of The Lorenz System
Consider the Lorenz system ([28, 30, 39])
˙x = −σ x + σ y ,
˙y = rx −y −xz ,
˙z = −bz + xy
(1.12)
where σ,r and b are positive parameters. Let us show that equation (1.12) is dissi-
pative. Introduce the auxilary function V : R3 →R+ given by
V (x, y, z) := 1
2

x2 + y2 + (z −σ −r)2
.
(1.13)
Direct computation along an arbitrary solution u = (x, y, z) of (1.12) shows that the
derivative of V along
˙V (x, y, z) = −σ x2 −y2 −b
2 (z −σ −r)2 + b
2 (σ + r)2 .
Thus in R3 we have
˙V ≤b
2 (σ + r)2 .
(1.14)
On the set
E1 :=

(x, y, z) | σ x2 + y2 + b
2(z −σ −r)2 ≤b
2(σ + r)2

1.2 Dissipativity
17
the inequality ˙V ≥0 is true and on the set R3\ E1 we have ˙V < 0. For large R the ball
BR = {(x, y, z) | V (x, y, z) < R} contains the ellipsoid E1. On the boundary of BR,
i.e. on the set SR = {(x, y, z) | V (x, y, z) = R} the inequality ˙V < 0 is satisﬁed. It
follows that BR is a bounded absorbing set. If we put κ = min{σ, 1, b
2} we conclude
that along the solution of (1.12)
˙V ≤−2κV + b
2(σ + r)2 .
This means that any solution of (1.12) enters the ellipsoid
E2 :=

(x, y, z) | 1
2

x2 + y2 + (z −σ −r)2
≤b
4κ (σ + r)2
and remains there during the positive existence interval. From (1.14) we have
V (x(t), y(t), z(t)) ≤V (x(0), y(0), z(0)) + b
2(σ + r)2t
for t ≥0. Since V cannot go to inﬁnity in a ﬁnite positive time, each of |x(t)|, |y(t)|,
and |z(t)| cannot go to inﬁnity in a ﬁnite positive time. Thus the Lorenz system is
complete in positive time. Thus the Lorenz system deﬁnes a semi-ﬂow in R3. From
(1.13) it follows that for a sufﬁciently large κ1 > 0 we have
˙V + κ1V ≥b
2(σ + r)2 =: c1
(1.15)
From (1.15) we get
d
dt (e κ1 tV ) ≥c1e κ1t .
Thus for t ≤0 we have
V (x(0), y(0), z(0)) −e κ1 tV (x(t), y(t), z(t)) ≥c1
κ1
[1 −e κ1 t]
or
V (x(t), y(t), z(t)) ≤e−κ1 tV (x(0), y(0), z(0)) + c1
κ1
[1 −e−κ1 t] .
Thus V (x(t), y(t), z(t)) cannot go to inﬁnity in ﬁnite negative time. Hence each
of |x(t)|, |y(t)| and |z(t)| cannot got to inﬁnity in ﬁnite negative time and the system
is complete in negative time ([8]).
Let us obtain other estimates for the region of dissipativity for (1.12). Consider
next the function
V1(x, y, z) := 1
2 x2 + 1
2 y2 + 1
2z2 −(σ + r)z .

Let us show that for an arbitrary solution u = (x, y, z) of (1.12) with b > 1 we have
lim sup
t→+∞
V1(x(t), y(t), z(t)) ≤c2 ,
(1.16)
where c2 := (σ+r)2(b−2)2
8(b−1)
. Indeed, a calculation shows that
˙V1 + 2V1 = −(σ −1)x2 −(b −1)z2 + (σ + r)(b −z)z
≤−(b −1)z2 + (σ + r)(b −2)z ≤2 c2 .
Therefore we have
d
dt (V1 −c2) + 2 (V1 −c2) ≤0 .
Multiplying the last inequality by e2t we get for t ≥0
d
dt [(V1 −c2)e2t] ≤0 .
(1.17)
Integrating (1.17) on [0, t], we obtain
V1(x(t), y(t), z(t)) −c2 ≤[V1(x(0), y(0), z(0)) −c2] e−2t ,
from which the inequality (1.16) results. From (1.16) it follows that the ellipsoid
{(x, y, z) ∈R3 | x2 + 1
2 y2 + 1
2z2 −(σ + r)z ≤c2}
is a region of dissipativity for (1.12).
Let us now show that for an arbitrary solution u = (x, y, z) of (1.12)
lim sup
t→+∞
[y2(t) + (z(t) −r)2] ≤l2r2

The direct computation shows that

From (1.18) it follows that the region of dissipativity D satisﬁes the inclusion
D ⊂D1 ,
where D1 := {(x, y, z) | y2 + (z −r)2 < l2r2} is a cylinder in R3.
Under the condition 2σ −b ≥0 it follows from (1.18) and (1.19) that
D ⊂D1 ∩{(x, y, z) | z ≥0} .
Remark 1.4 Using the Lyapunov function (1.13) and Proposition 1.7 one sees that
the Lorenz system has a compact attracting set which attracts bounded sets. It follows
that the Lorenz system is B-dissipative and has a minimal B-attractor AR3,min which
satisﬁes AR3,min ⊂D. Note that any other attractor of (1.12) also belongs to D.
Remark 1.5 Let us consider the system
˙x = −σ x + σ y ,
˙y = rx −y + xz ,
˙z = −bz + xy
(1.22)
withpositiveparametersσ,r andb.ThissystemdiffersfromtheLorenzsystem(1.12)
only in the sign of the nonlinearity xz in the second equation and the divergence of the
right-hand side of (1.22) is −(σ + 1 + b) < 0, i.e. the same as in the Lorenz system.
However, it was shown in [14] that system (1.22) for any positive parameters has

20

solutions converging to inﬁnity for t →+∞. But this means that system (1.22) is
not dissipative. We need certain extra conditions on the right-hand side in order to
guarantee dissipativity.
1.2.3
Lyapunov-Type Results for Dissipativity
Let us consider the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) on the Riemannian n-
dimensional Ck-manifold (M, g) which is, for continuous time, given by (1.5)
and for discrete time by (1.6). Suppose that there exists a scalar valued function
V : M →R which is C1 in the continuous-time case and C0 in the discrete-time
case. Deﬁne the Lie derivative ˙V (u) w.r.t. the dynamical system in the continuous-
time case by
˙V (u) := d
dt V (ϕt(u))|t=0 = (F(u), grad V (u))
(1.23)
and in the discrete-time case by
˙V (u) := V (ϕ(u)) −V (u).
(1.24)
Let us establish the following theorem which is a generalization of a result from
[40, 41], obtained for differential equations in Rn.
Proposition 1.10 Suppose that there exists a function as introduced above and such
that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) V is proper for M, i.e. for any compact set K ⊂R the set V −1(K) ⊂M is
compact and V is bounded from below on M;
(2) There exists an r > 0 such that ˙V (u) ≤0 for u /∈Br(0) ;
(3) The dynamical system does not have a motion ϕ(·)(υ) with ϕt(υ) /∈Br(0) and
˙V (ϕt(υ)) ≡0 for t ≥t0 .
Then the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is dissipative.
Proof Let us put η:= max
u∈Br(0)
V (u) and consider the setD:= {u ∈M|V (x)≤η}. In
the discrete-time case we choose η so large that additionally D ⊃ϕ1(Br(0)). By
assumption (1) we can write D = {u ∈M | θ ≤V (x) ≤η}, where θ := infu∈M
V (u) > −∞. Since K := [θ, η] is compact again by assumption (1) we conclude
that D is bounded. It follows from the deﬁnition of D that ϕt(D) ⊂D for all t ∈T+,
proposed that u ∈Br(0).
Let us show this. Assume to the contrary that there is a u ∈D and a time t1 ∈T+
such ϕt1(u) /∈D.
Consider at ﬁrst the continuous-time case. Here exists a maximum time t′ such
that 0 < t′ < t1 and ρ(ϕt′(u), 0) = r or put t′ := 0.
It follows that V (u) ≤η and on the interval (t′, t1) we have ρ(ϕt(u), 0) > r.
Now we conclude by continuity that V (ϕt1(u)) ≤V (u) ≤η, a contradiction. In the

1.2 Dissipativity
21
discrete-time case there must exist a time t2 ∈(0, t1) ∩Z+ such that ϕt2(u) ∈D ∩
Br(0), but ϕt2+1(u) /∈D. But this is impossible by the choice of D in the discrete-time
case.
Let us show now that for any point u ∈M with u /∈Br(0) there exists a time
t1 > 0 such that ϕt1(u) ∈Br(0). Suppose the opposite, i.e. ϕt(u) /∈Br(0) for all
t ∈T+. Then the positive semi-orbit of the motion ϕ(·)(u) is bounded. Indeed, by
condition (2) we have V (ϕt(u)) ≤V (u) for all t ∈T+. From this and assumption (1)
we obtain the boundedness of the semi-orbit. In virtue of this boundedness according
to Proposition 1.4, the ω-limit set of the semi-orbit of ϕ(·)(u) is non-empty. Let
υ ∈ω(u) be an arbitrary point. According to our assumption we have υ /∈Br(0).
The function V (ϕt(u)) is bounded on T+ and does not increase. Therefore, there
exists the limit
lim
t→+∞V (ϕt(u)) = V (υ) .
(1.25)
Consider the motion ϕ(·)(υ). By Proposition 1.4 we have ϕt(υ) ∈ω(u) for all t ∈T+.
It follows that for any t ∈T+ there exists a sequence tm →+∞as m →+∞such
that ϕtm(u) →ϕt(υ) as m →+∞. Hence by (1.25) we have
V (ϕt(υ)) ≡V (υ) ,
which contradicts the assumption (3). Thus, for arbitrary u ∈Rn with u /∈Br(0)
there exists a time t1 ∈T+ such that ϕt1(u) ∈Br(0).
□
Example 1.9 Consider the equation of a pendulum
¨x + ε ˙x + sin x = 0 ,
where ε > 0 is a parameter. This equation is equivalent to the planar system
˙x = y ,
˙y = −ε y −sin x .
(1.26)
Since the right-hand side of (1.26) is globally Lipschitz we have global existence
and uniqueness of all solutions. Let us denote the dynamical system generated by
(1.26) by ({ϕt}t≥0, R2, | · |). It is well-known that any semi-orbit of this system tends
to an equilibrium for t →+∞. The phase portrait is shown in Fig.1.3
It follows that the minimal global attractor 
AR2,min of (1.26) is the stationary set,
i.e. the set of all equilibria C.
Consider now a ball Bδ with small radius δ > 0 and center at a point
u0 = (x0, y0) on the stable manifold of a saddle (Figs.1.3 and 1.4).
It is obvious that ϕt(Bδ) converges for t →+∞to a set consisting of a saddle
point and of two heteroclinic orbits coming from this saddle point and going to stable
equilibria. It follows that the minimal global B-attractor is the union of the stationary
set C and the heteroclinic orbits (Fig.1.5).

In order to apply Proposition 1.10 one has to construct a Lyapunov-type function V
satisfying the assumptions (1)–(3). Very often this is a sufﬁciently difﬁcult problem.
In some cases one can avoid this as the next proposition ([32]) shows.
Consider the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, Rn, | · |) which is given for continuous
time by the ODE
˙ϕ = Aϕ + g(ϕ) ,

and for discrete time by the map
u →Au + g(u) , u ∈Rn .
(1.28)
In both cases A is an n × n matrix and g : Rn →Rn is continuous. The matrix
A is assumed to be stable, i.e. all eigenvalues of A have negative real part in the
continuous-time case, and all eigenvalues have moduli smaller one in the discrete-
time case.
Proposition 1.11 Suppose that the dynamical system is given by (1.29) resp. (1.30)
and g is a bounded map. Then the dynamical system is dissipative.
Proof Suppose that |g(u)| ≤c0 in Rn with some constant c0 > 0. Any motion ϕ(·)(u)
of the dynamical system can be written as
ϕt(u) = eAtu +

Deﬁnition 1.3 The equilibrium p of the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is said
to be globally asymptotically stable if p is asymptotically Lyapunov stable and for
any q ∈M we have ϕt(q) →p for t →+∞.
The next theorem was proved by E. A. Barbashin and N. N. Krasovskii in [1] for
continuous time. For discrete time it was shown in [29].

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Theorem 1.1 Suppose that p is an equilibrium of the dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T,
Rn, | · |) and there exists a function V : Rn →R (C1 in the continuous-time case
and C0 in the discrete-time case) such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) V (p) = 0 and V (u) > 0
for all
u ∈Rn\{p} ;
(2) ˙V (p) = 0
and
˙V (u) < 0
for all
u ∈Rn\{p} ;
(3) V (u) →+∞
for
|u| →+∞.
Then the equilibrium p is globally asymptotically stable.
Proof Let for simplicity be p = 0. It follows from the Lyapunov theorem that p = 0
is asymptotically Lyapunov stable. Suppose that ϕ(·)(q) is an arbitrary motion of the
dynamical system.
Using assumption (3) we choose r so large that
q ∈Br(0)
and
V (u) > V (q) for all |u| ≥r .
(1.33)
From assumption (2) we conclude that
V (ϕt(q)) ≤V (q) for all t ∈T+ .
(1.34)
Thus, if we take into consideration (1.33) we have
|ϕt(q)| < r
for all t ∈T+ .
Let us put c = lim
t→+∞V (ϕt(q)) and show that c = 0. If we assume that c > 0 there
exists a number r1 ∈(0,r) such that |ϕt(q)| ≥r1 for all t ∈T+. It follows that
r1 ≤|ϕt(q)| < r for t ∈T+. The proof is complete if we argue as in the Lyapunov
theorem.

Example 1.10 Let us show that the equilibrium u1 = (0, 0, 0) of the Lorenz system
(1.12) is globally asymptotically stable. Take the function
V (x, y, z) := 1
2(x2 + σ y2 + σz2) .

Existence of a Homoclinic Orbit in the Lorenz System

Introduction
InthissectionweconsideragaintheLorenzsystem.Wegiveestimatesfortheshapeof
a global B-attractor and prove the existence of homoclinic orbits for certain parameter
values. It will be shown that in certain cases these estimates are asymptotically
exact. Since all estimates are uniform with respect to the parameters, it becomes
possible to prove the existence of a homoclinic orbit using the formulae of asymptotic
integration. The Lorenz system
˙x = −σ(x −y),
˙y = rx −y −xz,
˙z = −bz + xy,
(1.35)
which is a three-mode approximation of a two-dimensional thermal convection, is
now one of the classical models for the transition from global stability to chaotic
behaviour and to the generation of attractors with non-integer Hausdorff dimension.
Sometimes the phrase “homoclinic explosion” is used to refer to the appearance of
various types of chaotic behaviour when parameters are perturbed from the bifurca-
tion parameter of a homoclinic orbit. In such a process the role of homoclinic orbits,
which appear for bifurcation values of parameters is very important. These orbits
and the attractors of the Lorenz system are located in certain domains of the phase
space which can be estimated. We shall suppose further that σ, r, b are positive
numbers. Let, in addition, r > 1 and 2σ > b. Note that if one of these restrictions
is violated then system (1.35) is convergent, i.e. any its orbit tends to a certain equi-
librium when t →+∞(Example 1.10). Along with system (1.35) we consider the
equivalent system
˙ξ = η,
˙η = −μη −ζξ −ϕ(ξ),
˙ζ = −Aζ −Bξη,

1.3.2
Estimates for the Shape of Global Attractors
In this section we shall obtain estimates which are for b ≤2 and great r asympto-
tically exact for a global B-attractor with respect to the coordinates ξ and η. From
these estimates if follows that a global B-attractor of system (1.36) is located in
domains which are uniformly bounded with respect to parameter r ∈(1, +∞). This
fact will be used for the demonstration of the existence of homoclinic orbits.

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
It was shown in Sect.1.2 that the surfaces
S1 := {(r −z)2 + y2 = l2 + ς} and S2 := {z −x2/(2σ) = −ς},
where ς > 0 and l is given by (1.20), are transversal (“contact-free”) for the solutions
of system (1.35). Hence the following inequalities hold on a global attractor of system
(1.35):
(r −z)2 + y2 ≤l2,
z ≥x2/(2σ) .
(1.37)
Hence it follows that on a global attractor of system (1.36)

(1.39)
Using estimate (1.37), we introduce the comparison system ([19, 20])
˙ξ = η,
˙η = −μη + ξ −ξ 3,
(1.40)
which is equivalent to the ﬁrst-order equation
P d P
dξ + μP −ξ + ξ 3 = 0.
(1.41)
Let us consider positive solutions P1(ξ) of (1.41) on the set [0, ξ0) with initial condi-
tion P1(ξ0) = 0. They deﬁne for system (1.36) in the half-space {ξ ≥0} the contact-
free surfaces

η = P1(ξ),
η > 0,
ξ ∈[0, ξ0]

,
{η < 0,
ξ = ξ0}.
(1.42)
Negative solutions P2(ξ) of (1.41) on (−ξ0, 0] with the initial condition
P2(−ξ0) = 0 deﬁne for system (1.36) in the half-space {ξ ≤0} the contact-free
surfaces

η = P2(ξ),
η < 0,
ξ ∈[−ξ0, 0]

,
{η > 0,
ξ = −ξ0}.
(1.43)
From this and from estimate (1.38) it follows that if the graph of the function

(1.45)
are true on the global attractor 
A of system (1.36). Note that the surfaces
{ζ = C −Bξ 2/2, C > Bξ 2
0 /2} are contact-free for system (1.36) in the strip
{|ξ| ≤ξ0}. Hence the estimate
ζ ≤B(ξ 2
0 −ξ 2)/2
(1.46)
holds on a global attractor of system (1.36). We have thus proved the following
result ([24]).
Theorem 1.2 Estimates (1.37)–(1.38), (1.44)–(1.46) hold on a global attractor of
system (1.35).
Let us give now a simple estimate of ξ0. To do this we note that the inequali-
ties (1.44) hold if the graph of η = P1(ξ) intersects the graph of the straight line
η = l/(
√
2 (r −1)). From the positiveness of μ in equation (1.41) it follows that
P1(ξ)2 > (ξ 2 −ξ 2
0 ) −1
2 (ξ 4 −ξ 4
0 ).
Therefore, a sufﬁcient condition for the above intersection to take place is that
(1 −ξ 2
0 ) −1
2 (1 −ξ 4
0 ) =
l2
2(r −1)2 .
This inequality implies that
ξ0 =
"
1 +
l
r −1 .
(1.47)
Similar reasoning may also be applied to estimate (1.45). It follows from relation
(1.47) that any global attractor of (1.36) lies in a domain which is bounded uniformly
with respect to the parameterr ∈(1, +∞). For a global B-attractor in the case b ≤2,

28

the estimates (1.37)–(1.38) are asymptotically the best possible as r →+∞. Indeed,
in this case, as r →+∞the following inequalities hold on the global B-attractor:
|η| ≤1/
√
2,
|ξ| ≤

2.
We recall that a part of a global B-attractor consists of the unstable manifold of
the zero equilibrium, which may be represented approximately (for small ε) by the
formulae

ζ = −Bξ 2/2,
η2 = ξ 2 −ξ 4/2

.
So for large r the global B-attractor has points close to the planes {|ξ| =
√
2},
{|η| = 1/
√
2}.
1.3.3
The Existence of Homoclinic Orbits
Let ξ +, η+, ζ + denote a solution of (1.36) associated with the positive branch of the
unstable manifold of the saddle point (0, 0, 0), that goes into the half-plane {ξ > 0},
that is, a solution of (1.36) such that
lim
t→−∞(ξ +(t), η+(t), ζ +(t)) = (0, 0, 0)
and ξ +(t) > 0 for t ∈(−∞, T ). Here T is a certain number or +∞. It is well-known
([20, 25, 27]) that if the values of σ and b and the value of r are close enough to 1,
then T = +∞.
Let us consider a smooth path s ∈[0, 1] →(b(s) , σ(s) , r(s)) in the parameter
space {b, σ,r}. The main result of this section is the following theorem ([24]).
Theorem 1.3 Suppose that for system (1.36) with parameters b(0), σ(0), r(0) there
exist numbers T > τ such that the relations
ξ +(T ) = η+(τ) = 0,
ξ +(t) > 0,
∀t < T,
(1.48)
η+(t) ̸= 0,
∀t < T,
t ̸= τ
(1.49)
hold. Suppose also that for system (1.36) with parameters b(1), σ(1), r(1) the
inequality
ξ +(t) > 0,
∀t ∈R
(1.50)
is true. Then there exists a number s0 ∈[0, 1] such that system (1.36) with parameters
b(s0), σ(s0), r(s0) has a solution (ξ +, η+, ζ +) corresponding to a homoclinic orbit.
In order to prove this assertion we shall need the following lemmas.

1.3 Existence of a Homoclinic Orbit in the Lorenz System
29
Lemma 1.1 If the conditions
η+(τ) = 0,
η+(t) > 0,
∀t ∈(−∞, τ),
hold for system (1.36), then ˙η+(τ) < 0.
Proof Suppose the contrary, i.e. ˙η+(τ) = 0. Then we derive from the two last equa-
tions of system (1.36) that
¨η+(τ) = Aζ +(τ) ξ +(τ) .
(1.51)
It follows from the relations η+(t) > 0, ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t ∈(−∞, τ) and from the last
equation of (1.36) that ζ +(t) < 0 , ∀t ∈(−∞, τ]. This inequality and (1.51) imply
the inequality ¨η+(τ) < 0 follows. But this contradicts the assumption ˙η+(τ) = 0 and
the conditions of the lemma. This contradiction proves Lemma 1.1.
□
Lemma 1.2 Consider system (1.36). Suppose that the relations (1.48), (1.49) and
the inequalities
η+(t) > 0,
∀t ∈(−∞, τ),
η+(t) ≤0,
∀t ∈(τ, T )
(1.52)
are true. Then inequality (1.49) also holds.
Proof Suppose the contrary. Then we conclude that a number ς ∈(τ, T ), exists such
that
η+(ς) = ˙η+(ς) = 0,
¨η+(ς) = Aξ +(ς)ζ +(ς) < 0,
η+(t) < 0,
∀t ∈(ς, T )
are valid. Note that the orbit corresponding to the solution (ξ(t), η(t), ζ(t)) =
(0, 0, ζ(0) exp(−At)) belongs to the stable manifold of the saddle point (0, 0, 0).
Hence, from the conditions (1.48), (1.49) and from the above relations it follows
that the positive branch of the unstable manifold corresponding to the solution
(ξ +, η+, ζ +) and the stable manifold intersect. Then the positive branch of the unsta-
ble manifold belongs completely to the stable manifold of the saddle, and the relation
ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t ≥ς is valid. The latter relation contradicts the hypothesis (1.48). This
contradiction proves Lemma 1.2.
□
Remark 1.6 It is possible to give the following geometrical interpretation of this
proof in the phase space with the coordinates ξ, η, ζ. A piece of the stable manifold of
the saddle ξ = η = ζ = 0 is situated “under” the set {ξ > 0, η = 0, ζ ≤1 −γ ξ 2}.
This property does not allow the trajectory with the initial data from the set to reach
the plane ξ = 0 if it remains in the quadrant {ξ ≥0, η ≤0}.
Let us consider the polynomial
λ3 + aλ2 + bλ + c,
(1.53)
where a, b, c are positive numbers.

30
1
Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Lemma 1.3 Either all zeros of the polynomial (1.53) have negative real parts, or
two of them have non-zero imaginary parts.
Proof It is well-known ([9]) that all the zeros of (1.53) have negative real parts if
and only if ab > c. If ab = c the polynomial (1.53) has two pure imaginary zeros.
Suppose now that for certain a, b, c with ab < c the polynomial (1.53) has only real
zeros. Since the coefﬁcients are positive it follows that these zeros are negative. This
leads to the inequality ab > c which contradicts our assumption.
□
Proof of Theorem 1.3 It is well-known ([12]) that the semi-orbit of system (1.36)
{(ξ +(t), η+(t), ζ +(t)) | t ∈(−∞, t0)} depends continuously on parameter s. Here
t0 is an arbitrary ﬁxed number. It follows from this and from Lemma 1.1 that, if
conditions (1.48)–(1.49) hold for system (1.36) with parameters b(s1), σ(s1), r(s1)
then these conditions also hold for b(s), σ(s), r(s) provided that s ∈(s1 −δ, s1 + δ).
Here δ is a certain sufﬁciently small number and the numbers τ and T depend on
parameter s. It follows from the above reasoning that the relations (1.48)–(1.49) are
valid for a certain interval (0, s0). Further we shall assume that (0, s0) is the maximal
interval where the relations (1.48)–(1.49) are valid. Let us demonstrate that there
exists a certain homoclinic orbit which corresponds to the values b(s0), σ(s0), r(s0).
We ﬁrst note that for these parameters and some value τ
η+(t) > 0, ∀t < τ,
η+(t) ≤0, ∀t ≥τ,
ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t ∈(−∞, +∞).
(1.54)
Indeed, if there exist numbers T2 > T1 > τ, for which
ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t ∈(−∞, T2),
ξ +(T2) = 0,
η+(T1) > 0,
η+(t) > 0, ∀t < τ,
η+(τ) = 0,
˙η+(τ) < 0
are true then for s sufﬁciently close to s0 and such that s < s0 the inequality
η+(T1) > 0 still holds. This contradicts the deﬁnition of the number s0. If there exist
numbers T1 > τ,forwhichη+(T1) > 0, η+(t) > 0,∀t < τ, η+(τ) = 0, ˙η+(τ) < 0,
and ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t ∈(−∞, +∞), then again for s sufﬁciently close to s0 and such
that s < s0 the inequality η+(T1) > 0 remains true and again we have a contradic-
tion with the deﬁnition of the number s0. If there exist numbers T > τ, for which
ξ +(t) > 0, ∀t < T , ξ +(T ) = 0, η+(t) > 0, ∀t < τ, η+(t) ≤0, ∀t ∈[τ, T ], then
the inequality (1.49) is true according Lemma 1.2. Consequently for s = s0 relations
(1.48)–(1.49) are fulﬁlled and then (0, s0) is not the maximal interval, for which these
relations are true. By these contradictions inequalities (1.54) are proven. It follows
from (1.54) that for s = s0 only an equilibrium can be the ω-limit set of the orbit of
(ξ +, η+, ζ +). Let us demonstrate that the equilibrium (ξ, η, ζ) = (1/√γ , 0, 0) can
not be an ω-limit point of this orbit. The linearization in the neighborhood of this
equilibrium gives the characteristic polynomial
λ3 + (A + μ)λ2 + (Aμ + 2/γ )λ + 2A.

1.3 Existence of a Homoclinic Orbit in the Lorenz System
31
Suppose that for s = s0 the ω-limit set of the positive branch of the unstable manifold
correspondingtothesolutionξ +, η+, ζ + includesthepoint(ξ, η, ζ) = (1/√γ , 0, 0).
By Lemma 1.3 and by the fact that the semi-orbits {ξ +(t), η+(t), ζ +(t) | t ∈
(−∞, t0)} depend continuously on the parameter s we obtain the following asser-
tion. For the values s which are sufﬁciently close to s0 the positive branch of the
unstable manifold corresponding to (ξ +, η+, ζ +) either tend to an equilibrium state
(ξ, η, ζ) = (1/√γ , 0, 0) as t →+∞, or oscillate in some time-interval with chang-
ing sign of the coordinate η. Both of these possibilities contradict properties (1.48)–
(1.49). Hence, for system (1.36) with parameters b(s0), σ(s0), r(s0) the orbit of
(ξ +, η+, ζ +) tends to the trivial equilibrium state as t →+∞.
□
Remark 1.7 Note that the proof of Theorem 1.3 actually yields a stronger result,
which may be formulated as follows. If relations (1.48)–(1.49) hold for s ∈[0, s0),
but not for s = s0, then system (1.36) with parameters b(s0), σ(s0), r(s0) has a
homoclinic orbit.
Let us apply Theorem 1.3 in various speciﬁc cases. Fix the numbers b and σ. It is
well-known ([20, 27]) that inequality (1.50) is true for r sufﬁciently close to 1. We
will show that if
3σ −2b > 1
(1.55)
and r is sufﬁciently large, then relations (1.48)–(1.49) will hold. Indeed, consider
the system
Q dQ
dξ = −μQ −Pξ −ϕ(ξ),
Q d P
dξ = −AP −BQξ,
(1.56)
which is equivalent to system (1.36) in the sets {ξ ≥0, η > 0} and {ξ ≥0, η < 0},
where P and Q are solutions of (1.56) which are functions of ξ. Since Theorem 1.2
implies that the quantities (ξ +(t), η+(t), ζ +(t)) are bounded uniformly with respect
to the parameter r, we can carry out an asymptotic integration of the solutions of
system (1.56) with a small parameter ε that correspond to the branch of the unstable
manifold under consideration. In the ﬁrst approximation these solutions may be
written in the form

It follows from these formulae that if inequality (1.56) holds, then for some T > τ
relations (1.48)–(1.49) will also hold and at the same time

η+(T ) = Q2(0) = −

Thus, all the conditions of Theorem 1.3 hold for the path s →(b(s), σ(s),r(s))
with b(s) ≡b, σ(s) = σ,r(0) = r1,r(1) = r2, where r1 is sufﬁciently large and r2
is sufﬁciently close to 1. We may therefore formulate the following result.
Corollary 1.1 For any positive numbers b and σ satisfying the inequality (1.55) a
number r ∈(1, +∞) exists, such that system (1.36) with these parameters b, σ and
r has a solution (ξ +, η+, ζ +) corresponding to a homoclinic orbit.
Remark 1.8 Corollary 1.1 was ﬁrst obtained in [21, 22] and discussed later in [5,
13, 23].
Now ﬁx σ = 10 and r = 28, and consider the parameter b ∈(0, +∞). It is well-
known ([5]) that for
b > 3σ −1
2
condition (1.50) is fulﬁlled. To analyse system (1.36) for small b, we reduce it to the
form
˙ξ = η,
˙η = −μη −uξ + ξ −ξ 3,
˙u = −Au + ε(2σ −b)
√σ
ξ 2 ,
(1.57)
where u = ζ + Bξ 2/2. Since the semi-orbit {(ξ +(t), η+(t), ζ +(t))|t ∈(−∞, t0]}
depends continuously on the parameter b, it follows that, when b is small, the system
(1.57) may be replaced by the system
˙ξ = η,
˙η = −ε(σ + 1)
√σ
η −uξ + ξ −ξ 3,
˙u = 2ε√σ ξ 2.
(1.58)
Numerical integration of the solution (ξ +, η+, ζ +) of system (1.58) for σ = 10,
r = 28showsthatconditions(1.48)–(1.49)aresatisﬁed.Hence,theabovearguments,
using Theorem 1.3, yield the following.

1.3 Existence of a Homoclinic Orbit in the Lorenz System
33
Corollary 1.2 Let σ = 10 and r = 28. Then there exists a positive number b0
such that system (1.36) with parameters b = b0, σ = 10 and r = 28 has a solu-
tion (ξ +, η+, ζ +) corresponding to a homoclinic orbit.
1.4
The Generalized Lorenz System
1.4.1
Deﬁnition of the System
To obtain examples for the illustration of the results proved above, we consider a
differential equation in R3 with four parameters ([10, 31]). Since this system includes
as a special case the well-known Lorenz system, it is called by us “generalized Lorenz
system”. Many systems which appear in physics can be reduced in a certain sense to
this system.
In this chapter the basic properties of the system are considered. This concerns
the existence of equilibrium states, conditions for global stability, dissipativity, and
estimates of the dissipativity region. At the end of the section we prove a theorem
on the convergence behaviour of the generalized Lorenz system.
Thus, consider the generalized Lorenz system
˙x = −σ x + σ y −ayz,
˙y = rx −y −xz,
˙z = −bz + xy,
(1.59)
where σ, b, r are positive parameters, a is a real parameter. In the case a = 0 this
system coincides with the Lorenz system, which, as it was noted in Sect.1.3, for
certain values of parameters has a strange attractor . System (1.59) in the form given
above, or in a form very close to it, was studied by numerical methods in many
physical papers. In these papers it was shown numerically that (1.59) may posses
a strange attractor also for a ̸= 0. Besides interest connected with the existence of
strange attractors, the Lorenz system also attracts the attention of scientists because
it has appeared as a model of convection in the atmosphere, and was used for the
description of other physical processes. The utility of reducing systems describing
different phenomena to the Lorenz system is conditioned by the fact that in previous
years the Lorenz model was studied intensively both by numerical and analytical
methods. Consequently, many results obtained can be applied to the original systems.
Similar to system (1.12), it encloses a large family of concrete systems. Several of
them will be considered below.
Let us pass to the investigation of the simplest properties of the generalized Lorenz
system. We shall deﬁne its equilibrium states in depending on the parameters and
shall show that in the case of unique equilibrium state the system (1.59) is globally
stable. In addition to this we shall prove the dissipativity of the system and ﬁnd some
estimates for its dissipativity region.

Equilibrium States
In Subsect. 1.4.1 we have investigated the equilibrium states of system (1.59) for
a = 0. The following theorem ([26]) describes the equilibrium states of the system
for a ̸= 0.
Theorem 1.4 Suppose that a ̸= 0.
(1) If σ + a > 0, r < 1 or
(2) σ + a < 0, r < σ/a + 2√−σ/a, then system (1.59) has the unique equilib-
rium state (0, 0, 0).
(3) If r > 1, then system (1.59) has exactly the three equilibrium states (0, 0, 0)
and (±x1, ±y1, z1).
(4) If σ + a < 0, σ/a + 2√−σ/a < r < 1, then (1.59) has exactly the ﬁve equi-
librium states (0, 0, 0), (±x1, ±y1, z1) and (±x2, ±y2, z2).

positive and different, then there are ﬁve equilibrium states. The above-mentioned
numbers ζ1 and ζ2 are the roots of the equation (1.60). Let us write them in the form
ζ1,2 = σb
2a2

a(r −2) −σ ±
&
a(r −2) −σ
2 + 4a2(r −1)

.
(1.61)
From (1.61) the validity of the theorem follows directly under condition (3).
Denote by Δ the expression under the square root in equality (1.61). Then we get
Δ = a2
(r −σ/a)2 + 4σ/a

.
It is easy to see that in the case when a > 0 or a < 0 and r > σ/a + 2√−σ/a then
Δ > 0; if a < 0 and r < σ/a + √−σ/a then we have Δ < 0.
From the last relation the validity of the theorem follows under condition (2).
Let condition (1) be satisﬁed. If a > 0, then a(r −2) −σ < 0 and ζ1 ≤0. If

a < 0, then 1 ≤−√−σ/a. Therefore if r < 2 + σ/a, then r < σ/a + 2√−σ/a
and, consequently, Δ < 0, and if r > 2 + σ/a, then a(r −2) −σ < 0 and ζ1 < 0.
Thus, the theorem holds if condition (1) is satisﬁed.
Let condition (4) be true. Then Δ > 0, a(r −2) −σ = a(r −1) −(a + σ) > 0,
and the assertion of the theorem follows from (1.61).

1.4.3
Global Asymptotic Stability
It is easy to check that for r < 1 and any a the unique equilibrium state (0, 0, 0) in
(1.59) is asymptotically Lyapunov stable.
The following theorem on the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium
state (0, 0, 0) generalizes the result of Example 1.10 in the case of arbitrary a ([3,
30, 39]).
Theorem 1.5 The equilibrium state (0, 0, 0) of system (1.59) is global asymptoti-
cally stable if one of two conditions is satisﬁed:
(1) σ + a > 0 and r < 1;
(2) σ + a < 0 and r < σ/a + 2√−σ/a.
Proof Suppose that condition (1) is satisﬁed and we put
V1(x, y, z) := 1
2[x2 + σ y2 + (σ + a)z2].
Then
˙V1(x, y, z) = −b(σ + a)z2 −σ x2 + σ(r + 1)xy −σ y2 < 0
for all (x, y, z) ̸= (0, 0, 0), because the quadratic form x2 −(r + 1)xy + y2 is pos-
itive deﬁnite for r < 1.
Suppose that condition (2) is satisﬁed. In this case the following inequality
r2 −2 σ
a r + σ 2
a2 + 4 σ
a < 0 holds. Consequently, one can ﬁnd a small ε such that the
inequality
r2 + 2σ
˜a r + σ 2
˜a2 −4σ
˜a < 0,
(1.62)
is true, where ˜a = −a + ε. Let us put
V2(x, y, z) := 1
2(x2 + ˜ay2 + εz2).
Then
˙V2(x, y, z) = −εbz2 −σ x2 + (σ + ˜ar)xy −˜ay2 < 0
for all (x, y, z) ̸= 0, since the quadratic form σ x2 −(σ + ˜ar)xy + ˜ay2 is positive
deﬁnite in virtue of inequality (1.62).

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
Now the statement of the present theorem follows from Theorem 1.1.
Remark 1.9 From Theorem 1.5 it follows in particular that chaotic behaviour of
system (1.59), as in the case of the Lorenz system, is possible only if the system has
several equilibrium states.
1.4.4
Dissipativity
Let us show that system (1.59) is B-dissipative and let us obtain some estimates of
the dissipativity region.
Take arbitrary numbers κ, κ1 and a number ς, such that
κ < min(1, b, σ),
κ1 + a > 0,
ς−≤ς ≤ς+,
where
ς± := σ + κ1r ± 2
#
κ1(σ −κ)(1 −κ),
and put for arbitrary (x, y, z) ∈R3
W(x, y, z) := 1
2 x2 + 1
2κ1y2 + 1
2(κ1 + a)z2 −ςz .
Lemma 1.4 Let u = (x, y, z) be an arbitrary solution of system (1.59). Then
lim sup
t→+∞
W

x(t), y(t), z(t)

≤R,
(1.63)
where
R :=
ς2(b −2κ)2
8κ(κ1 + a)(b −κ).
Proof We have
˙W(x, y, z) + 2κW(x, y, z) = −(σ −κ)x2 −κ1(1 −κ)y2 −(κ1 + a)(b −κ)z2
+ (σ + κ1r −ς)xy + ς(b −2κ)z
≤−(γ κ1 + a)(b −κ)z2 + ς(b −2κ)z ≤2κ R,
∀t ≥0.
Therefore along an arbitrary solution u = (x, y, z) of (1.59) we have
d
dt (W(x(t), y(t), z(t)) −R) + 2κ(W(x(t), y(t), z(t)) −R) ≤0,
∀t ≥0.
From this, after multiplication with e2κt, we get for all t ≥0

Thus, all orbits of system (1.59) enter the ellipsoid
E :=

(x, y, z) ∈R3 | x2 + κ1y2 + (κ1 + a)z2 −2ςz ≤2 R

and remain in it.
Let us obtain two other estimates for the dissipativity region of the generalized
Lorenz system ([26]).

where the number l is deﬁned by (1.20).
Proof Let us put for arbitrary y, z ∈R
W(y, z) := 1
2[y2 + (z −r)2 ].
Then for any κ ∈(0, κ0), where κ0 = min (1, b), we have
˙W(x, y, z) + 2κW(x, y, z) = (κ −1)y2 + (κ −b)z2 −2r(κ −b

From this it follows that along an arbitrary solution u = (x, y, z) of (1.59)
lim sup
t→+∞
W(y(t), z(t)) ≤
b2r2
8(b −κ)κ .
Minimizing by κ the right-hand side of the last inequality, we obtain the claimed
estimate.

Attractors and Lyapunov Functions
It follows from Lemma 1.5 that system (1.59) has a dissipativity region D satis-
fying the inclusion
D ⊂R × D1,
where D1 = {(y, z) ∈R2 | y2 + (z −r)2 < l2r2}.
Lemma 1.6 Suppose that 2σ −b ≥0 and a(b −2) ≥0. Let u = (x, y, z) be an
arbitrary solution of system (1.59). Then the estimate

Proof If we introduce in R3 the function
W(x, y, z) = (σ −ar)z −1

then the derivative of W with respect to (1.59) is given by

Singular Values, Exterior Calculus
and Logarithmic Norms
Abstract Global stability and dimension properties of nonlinear differential equa-
tions essentially depend on the contraction properties of k-parallelopipeds or k-
ellipsoids under the ﬂow of the associated variational equations. The goal of this
second chapter is to develop some elements of multilinear algebra for the investiga-
tion of linear differential equations. This includes the discussion of singular value
inequalities for linear operators in ﬁnite-dimensional spaces, the Fischer-Courant
theorem as an extremal principle for eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices, exterior
powers of operators and spaces, the logarithmic norm calculation and the use of
the Kalman-Yakubovich frequency theorem for the effective estimation of time-
dependent singular values of the solution operator to linear differential equations.
The Kalman-Yakubovich frequency theorem is also used to get sufﬁcient conditions
for convergence in dynamical systems.

Introduction
Dimension theory for linear differential equations is mainly connected with dimen-
sions of linear spaces V over a ﬁeld K ∈{R, C}. If V has a basis with a ﬁnite number
of vectors, then V is called ﬁnite-dimensional. Any basis of a ﬁnite-dimensional li-
near space V has the same number of vectors. This number is said to be the geometric
dimension of V and denoted by dim V. If there is no ﬁnite basis for V we say that the
space is inﬁnite dimensional and write dim V = ∞. The geometric dimension of the
linear space consisting only of the null vector is 0. A linear space V has dim V = 0
if and only if V consists only of the null vector.
Suppose that (V, (·, ·)) is a real or complex Euclidean space given by the n-
dimensional linear space V over K and the scalar product (·, ·). Using the standard
norm |z| := (z, z)1/2, z ∈V, we can, in addition to the linear structure, consider the
topology generated by this norm. It will be shown in Chap.3 that other dimensions

of V such as the topological dimension, Hausdorff dimension or Fractal dimension
(for bounded subsets) coincide with the geometrical dimension of V.
Let us brieﬂy consider one of the main topics of this book restricted to linear
differential equations with constant coefﬁcients in the plane. Assume the differential
equation in R2
˙x = −x ,
˙y = −y .
(2.1)
The solution of (2.1) starting for t = 0 at (x0, y0) has the form ϕt((x0, y0)) :=
(e−tx0, e−t y0) , t ∈R. It follows that for each (x0, y0) ∈R2 we have limt→+∞ϕt
((x0, y0)) = (0, 0) and, according to Deﬁnition 1.1, Chap. 1, AR2,min := {(0, 0)} is
the minimal global B-attractor of (2.1), i.e. AR2,min is a minimal closed and invariant
set(satisfyingϕt((0, 0)) ≡(0, 0), t ∈R)whichattractsallboundedsetsinR2.Tosee
this last property it is sufﬁcient to consider arbitrary parallelopipeds P := [a, b] ×
[c, d] ⊂R2 with numbers a < b, c < d. Since ϕt(P) = [e−ta, e−tb] × [e−tc, e−td]
we have limt→+∞ϕt(P) = (0, 0). Furthermore the ﬂow ϕ(·)(·) of (2.1) shrinks
arbitrary 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional volumes vol2 and vol1, respectively, of
parallelopipeds. This follows from the fact that
vol2 ϕt(P) = e−2t(b −a) (d −c) →0 as t →+∞,
vol1 (ϕt(P) ∩(R × {0})) = e−t(b −a) →0 as t →+∞
and
vol1 (ϕt(P) ∩({0} × R)) = e−t(d −c) →0 as t →+∞.
These properties imply, as it will be shown, that for any considered dimension
dim AR2,min = 0.
Since in the example AR2,min = {(0, 0)} is known, this last property is evident.
Consider now a second linear equation in the plane given by
˙x = 0 ,
˙y = −y .
(2.2)
The solution of (2.2) starting at t = 0 in (x0, y0) ∈R2 has the form ϕt((x0, y0)) :=
(x0, e−t y0). It follows that limt→+∞ϕt((x0, y0)) = (x0, 0) for each (x0, y0) ∈R2.
This implies that AR2,min := R × {0} is the minimal global B-attractor of (2.2), i.e.
AR2,min is a minimal closed and invariant set (satisfying ϕt(R × {0}) = R × {0}, t ∈
R) which attracts all bounded sets. To see the last property we consider paral-
lelopipeds of the type P := [a, b] × [c, d]. Since ϕt(P) = [a, b] × [e−tc, e−td]
it follows that dist(ϕt(P), AR2,min) →0 as t →+∞. Again 2-dimensional vol-
umes of parallelopipeds are shrinking since vol2ϕt(P) = e−t(b −a)(d −c) →0
as t →+∞. But arbitrary 1-dimensional volumes are not shrinking. Consider for
example vol1(ϕt(P) ∩R × {0}) = (b −a) ↛0 as t →+∞. It will be shown in the
following that this property is one of the reasons that dim AR2,min = 1 in this case.

2.1 Singular Values and Covering of Ellipsoids
43
2.1.2
Deﬁnition of Singular Values
In this subsection some important properties of matrices which are useful for dimen-
sion estimates are considered. If K = R or K = C we denote by Kn the n dimen-
sional vector space over K. As elements of the vector space we write u ∈Kn as a
row, meanwhile in the matrix calculus u is written as column. Let Mm,n(K) and
Mn(K) denote the m × n resp. n × n matrices over K ∈{R , C}. The transpose
of a matrix A ∈Mm,n(K) is denoted by AT . The adjoint matrix A∗is deﬁned as
A∗:= (A)T where A denotes the matrix A consisting of conjugate complex ele-
ments. For A ∈Mm,n(R) we use both notations AT and A∗(which coincide in
this case) for the transpose of A. We deﬁne the scalar product in Kn = Cn by
(u, υ) := n
i=1 ξiηi and in Kn = Rn by (u, υ) := n
i=1 ξiηi for all u = (ξ1, . . . , ξn)
and υ = (η1, . . . , ηn) from Kn. The Euclidean norm for u ∈Kn is |u| := √(u, u).
If it is necessary to distinguish between the scalar product in Cn(Rn) and a second
space Cm(Rm), we write (·, ·)n for the scalar product in Cn(Rn) and (·, ·)m for the
scalar product in Cm(Rm), respectively.
Let us recall some well-known deﬁnitions related to matrices. A matrix A ∈
Mn(C) (A ∈Mn(R)) is said to be Hermitian (symmetric) if A∗= A (AT = A).
The Hermitian (symmetric) matrix A ∈Mn(C) (A ∈Mn(R)) is called positive semi-
deﬁnite if (Au, u) ≥0 for all u ∈Cn (u ∈Rn) and positive deﬁnite if (Au, u) > 0
for all u ∈Cn, u ̸= 0 (u ∈Rn, u ̸= 0).
For a given positive semi-deﬁnite matrix A ∈Mn(K) any positive semi-deﬁnite
matrix B ∈Mn(K) satisfying the relation B2 = A is called (positive semi-deﬁnite)
square root of the matrix A.
A positive semi-deﬁnite root of A is denoted by
√
A or A
1
2 . It is well-known
that the square root of a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix exists and can be uniquely
determined.
A non-singular matrix A ∈Mn(C) (A ∈Mn(R)) is called unitary (orthogonal) if
A−1 = A∗(A−1 = AT ).
From the last deﬁnition one immediately concludes that for a unitary (orthogonal)
matrix A ∈Mn(C) (A ∈Mn(R))
(Au, Aυ) = (u, υ),
|Au| = |u|,
∀u, υ ∈Cn(Rn).
Consequently the transformation given by a unitary (orthogonal) matrix trans-
forms an orthonormal basis of Cn(Rn) onto itself.
Let us introduce the basic deﬁnition of singular values [24, 25, 38, 44, 52].
Deﬁnition 2.1 For a matrix A ∈Mn(K) the singular values are the non-negative
square roots of the eigenvalues of either A∗A or AA∗.
The singular values of a matrix A ∈Mn(K) are denoted by αi(A) (or shortly αi) and
are arranged in a non-increasing order α1(A) ≥α2(A) ≥· · · ≥αn(A).
Note that the number of positive singular values of A is equal to the rank of A.

Singular Values, Exterior Calculus and Logarithmic Norms
Proposition 2.1 Suppose that A ∈Mn(K) is non-singular and αi > 0, i = 1, 2,
. . . , n are its singular values. Then α−1
i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n are the singular values
of A−1.
Proof It is sufﬁcient to prove that the matrices (A−1)∗A−1 and (A∗A)−1 = A−1
(A∗)−1 have the same eigenvalues. But this follows immediately from the equation
det((A−1)
∗A−1 −λI) = det

A−1((A−1)∗A−1 −λI)A

= det(A−1(A∗)−1 −λI) ,
∀λ ∈C .
□
Let us demonstrate some geometric properties of the singular values of a matrix
A ∈Mn(R) viewing A as a linear map on Rn. Since (A∗A)1/2 is self-adjoint and
non-negative there exists an orthonormal basis of Rn, e1, . . . , en, which consists of

(the singular values of A) such that (A∗A)1/2ei = αiei, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. We observe
that (Aei, Ae j) = (A∗Aei, e j) = α2
i (ei, e j), so that the vectors Aei are orthogonal
and |Aei| = αi, Aei ̸= 0, if and only if αi > 0. So we obtain an orthogonal decom-
position of Rn into the space Rn
0, the nullspace of A, and the space Rn
1, the space
spanned by the vectors Aei ̸= 0, i.e. with αi > 0. Any u ∈Rn can be written as

Proposition 2.2 Let A ∈Mn(R) be an arbitrary matrix with singular values α1 ≥
α2 ≥· · · ≥αn ≥0 and let Br(0) be an arbitrary closed ball in Rn of radius r > 0
and with the center in 0. Then the image of Br(0) under the map u →Au, u ∈Rn,
is an ellipsoid E in the subspace Rn
1 whose semi-axes are the vectors Aei (ei the
eigenvectors of (A∗A)1/2 associated with eigenvalues αi > 0); the length of the
semi-axes are the numbers α jr, α j > 0.
Further, we use the following notation. Let α1(A) ≥α2(A) ≥· · · ≥αn(A) be the
singular values of A ∈Mn(K). For any k ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , n} we put

Suppose d ∈[0, n] is an arbitrary number. Clearly, it can be represented as
d = d0 + s, where d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1]. Now we put
ωd(A) :=
ωd0(A)1−sωd0+1(A)s ,
for d ∈(0, n] ,

for d = 0 ,
(2.4)
and call ωd(A) the singular value function of A of order d.
2.1.3
Lemmas on Covering of Ellipsoids
For the proof of the limit theorem in Chap.5 we need some lemmas on the covering
of ellipsoids by balls. The substantial role of ellipsoids and singular values of linear
maps for the estimates of the Hausdorff measure and dimension can be understood by
the following. The deﬁnition of the Hausdorff measure of a set (see Chap.3) involves
its coverings by balls. Considering some differentiable transformation of this set, one
can replace the image of each ball entering into the covering by the image of the
differential of this map. But under a linear map a ball of radius r transforms into an
ellipsoid with semi-axes {rαi}, where αi are the singular values of the linear map
(see Proposition 2.2).
Let E be an ellipsoid in Rn, ak(E) be the lengths of its semi-axes, a1(E) ≥a2(E) ≥
· · · ≥an(E) ordered with respect to its size. For an arbitrary number d ∈[0, n], which
we represent in the form d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1], let
us introduce the d-dimensional ellipsoid measure by
ωd(E) :=
a1(E) · · · ad0(E)ad0+1(E)s ,
for d ∈(0, n]
1 ,
for d = 0 .
(2.5)
As before we denote by Br(u) a ball of radius r with center in u. The next three
lemmas have been obtained in [13, 26, 28, 52].
Lemma 2.1 Let E ⊂Rn be an ellipsoid such that a1(E) ≤δ, ωd(E) ≤κ and 0 <
κ ≤δd. Then for any η > 0 the set E + Bη(0) is contained in the ellipsoid E′ such
that
ωd(E′) ≤(1 + cη)dκ,
where c := (δd0/κ)1/s.
Proof Denote ς := ad0+1(E). Without loss of generality we can assume that
ωd(E) = κ,
ad0+1(E) = · · · = an(E) = ς.

Then κ ≤δd0ςs and, consequently,
ς ≥(κ/δd0)1/s.
(2.6)
It is clear that Bς(0) ⊂E. Therefore
E + Bη(0) = E + η
ς Bς(0) ⊂E + η

E.
(2.7)
Put E′ := (1 + η/ς)E. We have
ωd(E′) = (1 + η/ς)dωd(E) ≤(1 + η/ς)dκ
(2.8)
and the assertion of the lemma follows from (2.6)–(2.8).
□
Lemma 2.2 Let E ⊂Rn be an ellipsoid with center in 0. Then for any η > 0 the
ellipsoid E′ :=

1 + η/an(E)

E contains the set E + Bη(0).
Proof Let δ := an(E). Since Bδ(0) ⊂E, we have
E + Bη(0) = E + η/δ Bδ(0) ⊂E + η/δ E = (1 + η/δ) E .
□
For an arbitrary bounded set A ⊂Rn we shall denote by NA(r) the minimal number
of balls of radius r necessary for covering of A.
Lemma 2.3 Let E ⊂Rn be an ellipsoid and 0 < r ≤an(E). Then
NE(√n r) ≤2nωn(E)/rn.
Proof The ellipsoid E can be inscribed into a parallelepiped with edges of length
2a1(E), . . . , 2an(E) that adopts a covering by N cubes with edges of length 2r, where

Singular Value Inequalities
2.2.1
The Fischer-Courant Theorem
In the following we need a classical theorem from linear algebra which is due to
Courant and Fischer. Let us formulate this theorem for completeness (see [18]).
Theorem 2.1 (Fischer-Courant) Suppose that A ∈Mn(K) is Hermitian (K = C) or
symmetric (K = R), and λ1 ≥λ2 ≥· · · ≥λn are its eigenvalues. Then we have
λ1 = max
u̸=0 (Au, u)/|u|2 ,
(2.9)
λk = min
|υ j|=1
max
u̸=0,
(u,υ j)=0,
j=1,2,...,k−1
(Au, u)/|u|2,
k = 2, . . . , n .
(2.10)
From the Fischer-Courant theorem we directly derive the following corollaries.
Corollary 2.1 Let A, B ∈Mn(K) be two Hermitian (K = C) or symmetric
(K = R) matrices. Suppose that λ1 ≥λ2 ≥· · · ≥λn and ν1 ≥ν2 ≥· · · ≥νn are
the eigenvalues of A and A + B, respectively. Then, if B is positive semi-deﬁnite
(positive deﬁnite) we have for j = 1, 2, . . . , n the inequalities λ j ≤ν j ( λ j < ν j
respectively).
Recall now that for an arbitrary A ∈Mn,m(K) the operator norm |A| is deﬁned
as
|A| := sup
|u|=1,
u∈Km
|Au| .
Corollary 2.2 Let the matrix A ∈Mn(K) be arbitrary with the singular values α1 ≥
α2 ≥· · · ≥αn. Then we have
|A| = α1 .
Proof From the Fischer-Courant theorem it follows that
α2
1 = sup
|u|=1
(A∗Au, u) = sup
|u|=1
|Au|2 = |A|2.
□
In the next corollary denote by Lk ⊂Rn an arbitrary linear subspace of dimension
k ≤n and by γ > 0 an arbitrary number.
Corollary 2.3 Suppose A ∈Mn(R) and |Au| ≤γ |u| , ∀u ∈Lk. Then we have
αn−k+1 ≤γ.
(2.11)

48
2
Singular Values, Exterior Calculus and Logarithmic Norms
If the matrix A is non-singular and |Au| ≥γ |u| , ∀u ∈Lk, then
αk ≥γ .
(2.12)
Proof Let us prove (2.11). Suppose that m ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is arbitrary and Pn−m+1 is
an arbitrary linear subspace of Rn of dimension n −m + 1. By the Fischer-Courant
theorem we have
α2
m ≤
max
u∈Pn−m+1,
u̸=0
(A∗Au, u)/|u|2.
Putting k = n −m + 1 and taking Lk in the role of the subspace Pn−m+1, we obtain
from above that
α2
n−k+1 ≤max
u∈Lk,
u̸=0
|Au|2/|u|2 ≤γ 2 .
The last inequality is equivalent to (2.11). Let us now prove (2.12). Since A is
non-singular, the subspace Pk := {Au | u ∈Lk} of Rn has the dimension k. Let u ∈
Pk be arbitrary. Then A−1u ∈Lk and by assumption, |u| = |AA−1u| ≥γ |A−1u|,
i.e. |A−1u| ≤γ −1|u|. From Proposition 2.1 it follows that 1/αk is the (n −k +
1)th singular value of A−1. Thus by (2.10) we have
1
αk ≤γ −1 and the corollary is
proved.

2.2.2
The Binet–Cauchy Theorem
In this subsection we discuss the Binet-Cauchy formula [2, 6] for matrices, and
derive from this formula Horn’s inequality for the singular value function. Our rep-
resentation is based on the book [18].
Proposition 2.3 (Binet-Cauchy formula) Let A =

ai j

∈Mm,n(K) and B =

bi j

∈Mn,m(K) with m ≤n be two arbitrary matrices and C := AB. Then we have
det C =

1≤r1<···<rm≤n

⎛

⎠.
The Binet–Cauchy formula allows us to express arbitrary minors of the prod-
uct of two rectangular matrices by minors of the two cofactors. Let two matrices
A =

ai j

∈Mn,l(K) and B =

bi j

∈Ml,m(K) be given, and deﬁne C = (ci j) =
AB. Consider an arbitrary minor C[α | β] of C with α = (i1, . . . , ik) and β =
( j1, . . . , jk), i.e.
C[α | β] := det
⎛
⎝
ci1 j1 . . . ci1 jk
. . . . . . . . . . . .
cik j1 . . . cik jk
⎞
⎠.

2.2 Singular Value Inequalities

We assume here that 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n, 1 ≤j1 < j2 < · · · < jk ≤m, and
k ≤min{n, m,l}. The matrix composed of elements of this minor is the product of
the two rectangular matrices

and
⎛

⎠.
Therefore, by the Binet–Cauchy formula we get for the minor C[α | β] the useful
representation
C[α | β] =

Let us now derive a further corollary from the Binet–Cauchy formula. Suppose
that υ1, υ2, . . . , υk are vectors from the space Kn, given in the canonical basis of Kn
byυ j = (υ j1, υ j2, . . . , υ jn), j = 1, 2, . . . , k.ThenitholdsthegeneralizedLagrange

(2.14)
Note that the validity of (2.14) results from the Binet–Cauchy formula since in the
left-hand side of equation (2.14) there is the determinant of the matrix A∗A, where
A is an n × k matrix whose columns are the vectors υ1, υ2, . . . , υk.
For k = 2 equality (2.14) gives the well-known Lagrange identity

The Binet–Cauchy formula can be used to prove the following lemma which
we need in the sequel for singular value estimations. Let k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} be a
natural number and consider in Kn the two arbitrary sets of vectors υ1, υ2, . . . , υk
and w1, w2, . . . , wk. Let us introduce for them a determinant of the form
[(υi, w j)] := det

The Inequalities of Horn, Weyl and Fan
Let us consider for arbitrary n × n matrices A and B the singular value function
ωd(AB) which was introduced in Sect.2.1.2. Our aim is to estimate this function by
ωd(A) and ωd(B).
The next proposition which gives this estimate and which also goes back to Horn
and Johnson [25] is a direct consequence of Lemma2.4.
Proposition 2.4 (Horn’s inequality) Let A, B ∈Mn(K) and d ∈[0, n] be arbitrary.
Then we have
ωd(AB) ≤ωd(A)ωd(B).
(2.15)
The next proposition is a direct corollary of the previous one.
Proposition 2.5 Suppose that A, S ∈Mn(K), S is non-singular and k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}
is arbitrary. Then we have

(2.17)
Denote by s1 ≥s2 ≥· · · ≥sn > 0 the singular values of the matrix S. Using
Proposition 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 from the Fischer-Courant theorem (Theorem2.1)
we get
ωk(S)ωk(S−1) = s1

The inequality to be proved in the following proposition goes back to Weyl [53].
The proof is borrowed from [18].
Proposition 2.6 (Weyl’s inequality) Let λ1, λ2, . . . , λn be the eigenvalues of the
matrix A ∈Mn(K), ordered as |λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥· · · ≥|λn|, and let k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}
be arbitrary. Then

2.2 Singular Value Inequalities
51
|λ1||λ2| · · · |λk| ≤ωk(A).
Proof Assume K = C. Let us consider the matrix A as operator in the space Cn and
let e1, e2, . . . , en be a basis of Cn in which A = (ai j) has a triangular form. The latter
is possible on the basis of Schur’s lemma [18, 44].
For i, j ∈{1, 2, . . . , k} we have

(2.19)
where Ak is the k × k matrix, consisting of the ﬁrst k rows and columns of the
matrix A, AT
k is the transposed of the matrix Ak, and Ak is the matrix, consisting
of the complex conjugated elements of Ak. The matrix A is triangular, whose main
diagonal consists of eigenvalues. Without loss of generality it can be assumed that
they are ordered as λ1, λ2, . . . , λn. Consequently, det Ak = λ1 . . . λk and

The next proposition was shown in [14] (see also [37, 39]).
Proposition 2.7 (Fan’s inequality) If α1, α2, . . . , αn is the complete system of eigen-
values of the matrix A ∈Mn(K) ordered so that
Re α1 ≥Re α2 ≥· · · ≥Re αn,
λ1 ≥λ2 ≥· · · ≥λn is the complete system of eigenvalues of the matrix (A∗+ A)/2,
and k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is arbitrary, then
Re (α1 + α2 + · · · + αk) ≤λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λk .
Proof Let us assume that ε > 0 is arbitrary and s1 ≥s2 ≥· · · ≥sn are the singular
values of the matrix I + εA. By the Weyl inequality (Proposition 2.6) we have for
any k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}

For small ε this gives for any j = 1, 2, . . . , n
s2
j = 1 + 2 ελ j + O(ε2).
(2.23)
It follows then by (2.22) and (2.23) that
1 + 2 εRe (α1 + α2 + · · · + αk) + O(ε2) ≤1 + 2 ε(λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λk) + O(ε2).
The last inequality completes the proof of Proposition 2.7.

Multiplicative Compound Matrices
Let n ∈N and k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary numbers. For any i ∈{1, . . . ,
n
k

} let
(i) := (i1, i2, . . . , ik) be the ith k-tupel of natural numbers 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · <
ik ≤n with respect to the lexicographic ordering, i.e. (i) = (i1, . . . , ik) < ( j) =
( j1, . . . , jk) if and only if there exists a t ∈{1, . . . , k}, such that it < jt and is = js
for all s ∈{1, . . . , t −1}. Denote by Qk,n the lexicographically ordered set of such
k-tupels.
Example 2.1 Suppose that n = 3 and k = 2. Then we can write
Q2,3 = {(1), (2), (3)} with (1) = (1, 2), (2) = (1, 3) and (3) = (2, 3).
Suppose that
A = (ai j) ∈Mn,m(K) and k ∈{1, . . . , min(n, m)}. For any
(i) ∈Qk,n and ( j) ∈Qk,m let A[(i), ( j)] denote the k × k submatrix of A the (s, t)th
element (s, t ∈{1, . . . , k}) of which is ais jt. Now we can give the following deﬁnition
[8, 16, 18, 37, 44].
Deﬁnition 2.2 Let A ∈Mn,m(K) and k ∈{1, . . . , min(n, m)} be arbitrary. The kth

matrix A(k) the (i, j)th element
of which is det A[(i), ( j)] with (i) ∈Qk,n and ( j) ∈Qk,m.
Example 2.2 Assume that n = 2, m = 3 and k = 2. Then Q2,2 = {(1, 2)}, Q2,3 =
{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}. If A = (ai j) is a given 2 × 3 matrix then A(2) is the 1 ×

=
1 × 3 matrix given by A(2) = [det A[(1, 2)|(1, 2)], det A[(1, 2)|(1, 3)], det A[(1, 2)
|(2, 3)]] .
Using now the language of compound matrices we can state the following second
version of the Binet-Cauchy theorem. We omit a direct proof. The result can be
immediately deduced from Proposition 7.10, Chap.7.

2.3 Compound Matrices

Proposition 2.8 Let A ∈Mm,n(K), B ∈Mn,p(K) and the number k ∈{1, . . . ,
min(m, n, p)} be arbitrary. Then we have
(AB)(k) = A(k)B(k).
In the next proposition [19, 29, 37, 39, 44] we shall give an overview over the most
important properties of multiplicative compound matrices.
Proposition 2.9 Let A ∈Mn(K) and k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary. Then it holds:
(a) A(1) = A;
A(n) = det A;
(b) I (k)
n
= I(n
k);
(λA)(k) = λk A(k) ∀λ ∈K;
(c) If A is non-singular then A(k) is non-singular and (A(k))−1 = (A−1)(k);
(d) (AT )(k) = (A(k))T ;
(A∗)(k) = (A(k))∗;
(e) If A is unitary or symmetric, then also A(k);
(f) If A is a lower (upper) triangular matrix, then A(k) is also a lower (upper)
triangular matrix;
(g) The complete system of eigenvalues of A(k) consists of all possible
n
k

products
of the form λi1 · λi2 · · · λik with 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n where λ1, . . . , λn is
the complete system of eigenvalues of A (Kronecker’s theorem);

tr A(k) =

Proof We restrict ourselves to the proof of (c), (e), (g) and (f).
(c) From AA−1 = In it follows with Proposition 2.8 and the part (b) of this propo-
sition that
(AA−1)(k) = A(k)(A−1)(k) = I(n
k).
(e) With AA∗= In, by Proposition 2.8 and (d) we conclude that
(AA∗)(k) = A(k)(A∗)(k) = A(k)(A(k))∗= I(n
k).
(g) From Schur’s lemma it follows that there exists an upper triangular matrix
T ∈Mn(C) and a unitary matrix U ∈Mn(C) such that A = U T U ∗and the
main diagonal elements of T are the eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λn of A. Hence from
Proposition 2.8 and (d) it follows that A(k) = (U T U ∗)(k) = U (k)T (k)(U ∗)(k) =
U (k)T (k)(U (k))∗.
From (f) we see, that T (k) is upper triangular and the main diagonal elements are
the numbers λi1 · λi2 · · · λik with arbitrary indices 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n.
Since U (k) is unitary (see (e)), the eigenvalues of A(k) are the diagonal elements
of T (k).

From Proposition 2.9 we can deduce the following corollaries.
Corollary 2.4 If A ∈Mn(K) is positive deﬁnite (positive semi-deﬁnite) then A(k) is
also positive deﬁnite (positive semi-deﬁnite).
Corollary 2.5 Suppose A ∈Mn(K) is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix and λ1(A) ≥
· · · ≥λn(A) ≥0 are the ordered eigenvalues of A. If k ∈{1, . . . , n} is arbitrary and
λ1(A(k)) ≥· · · ≥λ(n

λ1(A(k)) = λ1(A) · λ2(A) · · · λk(A)

u1, . . . , uk.
Let us consider the most important properties of exterior products [15, 16, 29,
37, 44].
Proposition 2.10 (a) The exterior product is multilinear, i.e. linear in any argument
if the remaining arguments are ﬁxed;
(b) span{u1 ∧u2 ∧· · · ∧uk, ui ∈Kn} = K(n
k);
(c) The vectors u1, u2, . . . , uk ∈Kn are linearly independent if and only if u1 ∧
u2 ∧· · · ∧uk ̸= 0;
(d) If π is an arbitrary permutation of {1, 2, . . . , k} then
uπ(1) ∧· · · ∧uπ(k) = (sign π)u1 ∧· · · ∧uk ;
(e) For arbitrary A ∈Mn(K), k ∈{1, . . . , n} and u1, . . . , uk ∈Kn we have
A(k)(u1 ∧· · · ∧uk) = Au1 ∧· · · ∧Auk ;
(f) For arbitrary vectors u1, . . . , uk and υ1, . . . , υk from Kn (k ≤n) we have
(u1 ∧· · · ∧uk, υ1 ∧· · · ∧υk)K(n
k) = det[(us, υt)Kn|k
s,t=1] .
Proof We shall restrict ourselves to the proof of (e) and (f).
(e) Let u1, . . . , uk ∈Kn be arbitrary column vectors. By deﬁnition of the exterior
product and by Proposition 2.8 we have
A(k)(u1 ∧· · · ∧uk) = A(k)[u1, . . . , uk](k) = (A[u1, . . . , uk])(k)
= [Au1, . . . , Auk](k) = Au1 ∧· · · ∧Auk .

Remark 2.1 (a) For arbitrary u1, . . . , un ∈Kn and A ∈Mn(K) by Propositions

Au1 ∧· · · ∧Aun = A(n)(u1 ∧· · · ∧un) = det A(u1 ∧· · · ∧un).
This means that det A is the distortion factor of the exterior product of u1, . . . , uk

Additive Compound Matrices
We deﬁne the additive compound matrix in the following way [37, 39, 46]:
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let A ∈Mn(K) and k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary. Then we call
A[k] := d
dh (I + h A)(k)|h=0
the kth additive compound matrix of A.
We shall present some of the most important properties of additive compound
matrices in the next proposition [37, 39, 44].
Proposition 2.11 Let A, B ∈Mn(K) and k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary. Then we
have:
(a) A[k](u1 ∧· · · ∧uk) = Au1 ∧· · · ∧uk + u1
∧Au2 ∧· · · ∧uk + · · · + u1 ∧· · · ∧Auk ,
∀u1, . . . , uk ∈Kn ;
(b) (β A + β′B)[k] = β A[k] + β′B[k],
∀β, β′ ∈K ;
(c) The complete system of eigenvalues of A[k] consists of all possible
n
k

sums of
the form λi1 + · · · + λik , where λ1, . . . , λn is the complete system of eigenvalues
of the matrix A and 1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤n ;
(d) A[1] = A ;
A[n] = tr A .
Proof (a) By deﬁnition, from Proposition 2.9 and the product rule for exterior pro-
ducts it follows that for arbitrary u1, . . . , uk ∈Kn
A[k](u1 ∧· · · ∧uk) = d
dh (I + h A)(k)(u1 ∧· · · ∧uk)|h=0
=
d
dh [(I + h A)u1 ∧· · · ∧(I + h A)uk] |h=0
= Au1 ∧· · · ∧uk + u1 ∧Au2 ∧· · · ∧uk + · · · + u1 ∧· · · ∧Auk .
(b) From Proposition 2.9 we have for arbitrary h ∈R, β, β′ ∈K ,
(I + h β A)(k)(I + h β′B)(k) = ((I + h β A)(I + h β′B))(k)
= (I + h(β A + β′B) + h2ββ′AB)(k) ,
which proves the second assertion.
(c) As a conclusion of Schur’s lemma [44] there exists an upper triangular matrix
T ∈Mn(C) with elements λi on the main diagonal and a unitary matrix U ∈Mn(C),
so that A = UTU ∗. Hence by deﬁnition and by Propositions 2.8 and 2.9 one gets
for arbitrary h ∈R

2.3 Compound Matrices
57
(In + h A)(k) = (In + h UTU ∗)(k)
= (U(In + h T )U ∗)(k) = U (k)(In + h T )(k)(U (k))∗.
Obviously In + h T is an upper triangular matrix with main diagonal elements of
the form 1 + h λi (i = 1, . . . , n). Hence by Proposition 2.9(f, g) it follows, that
(In + h T )(k) is also an upper triangular matrix with main diagonal elements of
the form k
j=1(1 + hλi j), where 1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤n are arbitrary elements from
Qk,n. Since U is unitary, then by Proposition 2.9(e) the matrix U (k) has the same
property and the eigenvalues of A[k] are the eigenvalues of
d
dh (In + h T )(k)|h=0, i.e.
the complete system of eigenvalues of A[k] consists of all possible values
d
dh
k
j=1
(1 + hλi j)|h=0 = λi1 + · · · + λik
with 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n.
(d) The ﬁrst property follows immediately from deﬁnition, the second follows
from the relation
A[n] = d
dh (I + h A)(n)
|h=0 = d
dh det (I + h A)|h=0 = tr A .
□
Let us express explicitly the elements of A[k] through the elements of A. We give the
result in form of a proposition [16, 37, 46].

Then the

Proof Consider for simplicity k = 2. By deﬁnition the element of (I + h A)(2) which
belongs to the ith row and the jth column with (i) = (i1, i2) and ( j) = ( j1, j2) is
(δi1 j1 + hai1 j1)(δi2 j2 + hai2 j2) −(δi2 j1 + hai2 j1)(δi1 j2 + hai1 j2) ,
where δkl is the Kronecker symbol. It follows immediately that

Let us demonstrate how to use the properties of compound matrices for the investiga-
tion of linear differential equations. Suppose that A(·) is a continuous n × n matrix
valued function and consider the equation
dυ
dt = A(t)υ .
(2.25)
Proposition 2.13 Let Φ(·) be the fundamental matrix of (2.25) and let the number
k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary. Then it holds:
(a) Φ(·)(k) is the fundamental matrix of the system

dw
dt = A(t)[k]w ;
(2.26)
(b) If υ1(·), υ2(·), . . . , υk(·) are arbitrary solutions of system (2.25) then
w(·) = υ1(·) ∧υ2(·) ∧· · · ∧υk(·) is a solution of (2.26).
Proof (a) Since Φ(·) is the fundamental matrix of (2.25) we have for small h and
arbitrary ﬁxed t ∈R
Φ(t + h) =

I + h A(t)

Φ(t) + o (h) .
Thus, by Proposition 2.8
Φ(t + h)(k) = (I + h A(t))(k) Φ(t)(k) + o (h) .
From this representation it follows that Φ(·)(k) is a solution of (2.26). It is clear that
for any t the matrix Φ(t)(k) is non-singular. Thus the statement (a) is proved.
Let us prove (b). For this we put U(t) := (υ1(t), υ2(t), . . . , υk(t)). Let us take
a constant n × k matrix C such that U(t) = Φ(t)C where Φ(·) is the fundamental
matrix of (2.25). By Proposition 2.8 we have U(t)(k) = Φ(t)(k)C(k), i.e. by (a) the
function U(t)(k) = υ1(t) ∧· · · ∧υk(t) is a solution of system (2.26).
□
Let us show now that the set of all solutions of (2.25) that converge to zero for
t →+∞can be characterized by the geometric dimension of a solution subspace or
by the asymptotic stability of a compound equation (2.26). In Chap.5 linear equations
(2.25) arise as variational equations with respect to solutions of nonlinear differen-
tial equations. It will be shown there that, under certain conditions, the geometric
dimension properties of the variational equations are connected with Hausdorff and
fractal dimension bounds of invariant sets of the nonlinear equation.
Let us recall some standard stability properties for the trivial solution υ(t) ≡0 of
(2.25). We consider this solution for t ≥t0.
Deﬁnition 2.5 We say that the trivial solution of (2.25) is:
(a) Lyapunov stable, if for every ε > 0 and every t1 ≥t0 there exists δ > 0 such
thatanysolutionυ(·)of(2.25)with|υ(t1)| < δ existson[t1, ∞)andsatisﬁes|υ(t)| <
ε for all t ≥t1 ;
(b) asymptotically Lyapunov stable, if it is Lyapunov stable, and if for each t1 ≥t0
there exists an η > 0 such that for any solution υ(·) of (2.25) with |υ(t1)| < η we
have limt→+∞|υ(t)| = 0 ;
(c)globallyasymptoticallyLyapunovstable,ifitisLyapunovstable,andifforeach
t1 ≥t0 and each solution υ(·) of (2.25) on [t1, +∞) we have limt→+∞|υ(t)| = 0 ;
(d) uniformly Lyapunov stable, if for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for
any t1 ≥t0 each solution υ(·) of (2.25) with |υ(t1)| < δ exists on [t1, ∞) and satisﬁes
|υ(t)| < ε for all t ≥t1.
(e) exponentially asymptotically stable, if there exists a λ > 0 and, given any
ε > 0, there exists a δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that for any t1 ≥t0 each solution υ(·) of
(2.25) with |υ(t1)| < δ exists on [t1, ∞) and satisﬁes |υ(t)| ≤εe−λ(t−t1) for all t ≥t1.

It is easy to see that the trivial solution of (2.25) is asymptotically Lyapunov stable
if and only if it is globally asymptotically Lyapunov stable. Note that the stability
property of any solution of the linear system, (2.25) is equivalent to the stability of
the trivial solution. Thus one may associate that property to the Eq.(2.25).
Now we come to a proposition from [46] for the dimension-like characterization
of the set of solutions of (2.25) which converge to zero.
Proposition 2.14 Suppose that (2.25) is uniformly Lyapunov stable. Then (2.25) has
an (n −k + 1)-dimensional subspace with k ∈{1, . . . , n} of solutions υ(·) satisfying
limt→+∞υ(t) = 0 if and only if the kth compound equation (2.26) is asymptotically
Lyapunov stable.
Proof (a) Suppose (2.25) has an (n −k + 1)-dimensional subspace of solutions υ(·)
satisfying limt→+∞υ(t) = 0. We can assume that there are (n −k + 1)-linearly
independent solutions υ1, . . . , υn−k+1 having the property that limt→+∞υi(t) =
0, i = 1, . . . , n −k + 1. Let us complete this system to a basis {υ1, . . . , υn} of
the n-dimensional solution space of (2.25). It is clear from Proposition 2.10 that
the solution space of the kth compound equation (2.26) is
n
k

-dimensional and has a
basis consisting of all exterior k-products υi1 ∧· · · ∧υik with 1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤n.
It follows that any solution of (2.26) can be written as linear combination of such
k-products. But in any k-products υi1 ∧· · · ∧υik is at least one solution from the set
{υ1, . . . , υn−k+1} which converges to zero as t →+∞. Using the uniform Lyapunov
stability of (2.25) it follows now that (2.26) is Lyapunov stable and that all solutions
υi are bounded on [t0, ∞). Thus the k-products υi1(t) ∧· · · ∧υik(t) converge to zero
as t →+∞.
(b) Let us assume now that (2.26) is globally asymptotically Lyapunov stable. We
have to show that (2.25) has an (n −k + 1)-dimensional subspace of solutions υ(·)
which satisfy limt→+∞υ(t) = 0.
Suppose that υ1, . . . , υn are n linearly independent solutions of (2.25) on [t0, ∞)
and that there are m ≥k of them, say υ1, . . . , υm, having the property that υi(t) ↛0
for t →+∞, i = 1, . . . , m. Consider any k-product of solutions υi1 ∧· · · ∧υik,
1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤m. Since this is a solution of (2.26) we have υi1(t) ∧· · · ∧
υik(t) →0 as t →+∞. But this implies that υi1(t0) ∧· · · ∧υik(t0) = 0, a contra-
diction to the fact that the vectors υi1(t0), . . . , υik(t0) are linearly independent. The
contradiction shows that m < k and that there are at least n −k + 1 solutions of the
basis set {υ1, . . . , υn} which converge to zero as t →+∞.

Lozinskii’s Theorem
For estimating the growth of solutions of differential equations, the well-known
Wåzewski inequality can be used. But a more ﬂexible result gives an estimate of
Lozinskii, which is based on the use of logarithmic matrix norms [17, 20]. In this

2.4 Logarithmic Matrix Norms
61
subsection we shall give a short introduction to such norms which is based on [9,
10, 41]. Let ∥· ∥be some vector norm in Rn. Any such vector norm induces for
A ∈Mn(R) an operator matrix norm which is given by the equality
∥A∥:= max
∥ξ∥=1,
ξ∈Rn
∥Aξ∥.
Further, some such matrix norms will be used under the assumption that they are
induced by means of the corresponding vector norms. The operator matrix norm of
A induced by the Euclidean vector norm | · | is denoted by |A|.
Deﬁnition 2.6 The logarithmic norm or Lozinskii norm of a square matrix A ∈
Mn(R) is the number Λ(A) given by
Λ(A) := lim
h→0+
""I + h A
"" −1
h
.
The number Λ(·) depends on the choice of the matrix norm. Note that the log-
arithmic norm does not possess all the properties of a usual norm. The following
example shows that it may be negative.
Example 2.4 Suppose that the matrix norm of A = (ai j) ∈M2(R) is given by
∥A∥= maxi

j |ai j|. Consider the matrix
A =

.
Then Λ(A) = −1.
Table 2.1 shows the matrix norm and other notions.
Proposition 2.15 Deﬁnition 2.6 is correct, i.e. for any A ∈Mn(R) the number Λ(A)
exists.

Proof Consider for h > 0 the function f (h) := ∥I+h A∥−1
h
. Let us show that f (h)
is decreasing for h →0+ and bounded from below. Suppose k ∈(0, 1) is arbi-
trary. Then we have by the triangle inequality kh f (kh) = ∥I + kh A∥−1 = ∥k(I +
h A) + (1 −k)I∥−1 ≤k∥I + h A∥+ 1 −k −1 = kh (∥I+h A∥−1)
h
= kh f (h).
It follows that f (kh) ≤f (h) ∀k ∈(0, 1), i.e. f (θ) is decreasing if θ is decreas-
ing. The boundedness from below follows immediately from the inequality
f (h) ≥
1 −h∥A∥
 −1
h
= −∥A∥,
which is satisﬁed for small h > 0.
□
The logarithmic matrix norm has several basic properties, which follow directly
from its deﬁnition:
Proposition 2.16 Suppose that A and B are real n × n matrices, ∥· ∥is the con-
sidered matrix norm and β ∈R+ is a number. Then it holds:
(1) Λ(A + B) ≤Λ(A) + Λ(B) ;
(2) Λ(β A) = βΛ(A) ;
(3) Λ(A) ≤∥A∥.
Proof In order to prove the assertion (1) we can write for any h > 0
∥I + h(A + B)∥−1 = 1
2(∥I + 2 h A + I + 2 hB∥−2)
≤1
2(∥I + 2 h A∥−1) + 1
2(∥I + 2 h B∥−1) .
From this it follows that
lim
h→0+
∥I + h(A + B)∥−1
h
≤lim
h→0+
∥I + 2 h A∥−1
2 h
+ lim
h→0+
∥I + 2 hB∥−1
2 h
= Λ(A) + Λ(B) .
Let us show (2). If β = 0 then Λ(0) = 0 = 0 · Λ (0). Suppose β > 0. We have by
deﬁnition
Λ(β A) = lim
h→0+
∥I + βh A∥−1
h
= β
lim
βh→0+
∥I + βh A∥−1
βh
= βΛ(A).
The last assertion follows from the inequality
Λ(A) ≤lim
h→0+
1 + h∥A∥−1
h
= ∥A∥.

If we use the inequality

The Lozinskii estimate (2.28) can be used to derive sufﬁcient conditions for the
stability of (2.27). This is shown in the next corollary [46] where t0 ≥0 is an arbitrary
number.
Corollary 2.8 The linear system (2.27) is:
(a) Lyapunov stable, if lim supt→+∞
# t
t0
Λ(A(τ))dτ < ∞;
(b) asymptotically Lyapunov stable, if limt→+∞

Λ(A(τ))dτ = −∞;
(c) uniformly Lyapunov stable, if
# t
s
Λ(A(τ))dτ ≤M, t0 ≤s ≤t < ∞,
M independent of s and t.
If we make use of logarithmic norms (Lozinskii’s estimate, in particular), then
the following proposition may be useful.
Proposition 2.17 Let the logarithmic norm Λ for n × n matrices be deﬁned through
the Euclidean vector norm, let λ1 ≥λ2 ≥· · · ≥λn be the eigenvalues of the matrix
(A + A∗)/2 and let k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Then
Λ(A[k]) = λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λk.
Proof Firstly, we prove that
Λ(A) = λ1.
(2.33)
For any h ∈R a vector ξh, |ξh| = 1, can be found such that
I + h A
2 =

(I + h A)ξh, (I + h A)ξh

Therefore, Λ(A) ≤λ1. Let us show the opposite inequality. Choose a vector η,
|η| = 1, such that

(A∗+ A)η, η

= 2λ1. Then in the same way as above we get
I + h A
 −1 ≥h
2

(A∗+ A)η, η

+ o(h) = hλ1 + o(h).
It follows that Λ(A) ≥λ1 and (2.33) is proved.
Since the square matrix A from (2.33) is arbitrary, we can replace it by A[k]. Then
Λ(A[k]) = λ,
where λ is the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix

A[k] + A[k]∗
/2. Since
A[k] + A[k]∗=

A + A∗[k]
(see (2.25) and (2.26)), by Proposition 2.12 we get
λ = λ1 + λ2 + · · · + λk.
□
Remark 2.2 Often used vector norms for u = (u1, . . . , un) ∈Rn, different from the
standard Euclidean norm, are
∥u∥1 = max
i=1,...,n |ui| and ∥u∥2 =

Remark 2.3 Generally speaking, the Lozinskii estimate (2.28) is non-invariant
with respect to a Lyapunov transformation %υ = Q(t)υ, where Q is a Lyapunov
matrix, i.e. a continuously differentiable square matrix, satisfying the conditions
| det Q(t)| ≥const > 0, ∀t ≥0, supt≥0 |Q(t)| < ∞, and maxt≥0 | ˙Q(t)| < ∞. The

Sometimes this inequality may give an estimate which is better than (2.28).

equation

∀t ∈R+ .
(2.36)
Now we ﬁnd some inequalities for singular values of the Cauchy matrix, which
generalize formula (2.36). Let α1(t) ≥α2(t) ≥· · · ≥αn(t) be the singular values of
the matrix Φ(t), Λ(·) be an arbitrary logarithmic norm and ∥· ∥be the vector norm
being used for the deﬁnition of the norm Λ. The next proposition goes back to [5].
Proposition 2.18 For k = 1, 2, . . . , n and t ≥0 the following inequalities are true:
α1(t)α2(t) · · · αk(t) ≤β1(t; k) exp

(2.38)
Here β1(· ; k), β2(· ; k) ∈C(R+) are two functions, depending on k and the norm
∥· ∥such that there exist positive constants ci1, ci2, satisfying the inequalities ci1 ≤
βi(t; k) ≤ci2. In addition, βi(0; k) = 1 and, if the norm ∥· ∥coincides with the
Euclidean norm, βi(t; k) ≡1(i = 1, 2; k = 1, 2, . . . , n).
To prove Proposition 2.18 we need the following lemma. Let us for the numbers
k = 1, 2, . . . , n consider the kth compound system of (2.27), i.e.
dw
dt = A(t)[k]w.
(2.39)
Lemma 2.5 Suppose that k = 1, 2, . . . , n, Ψ is the Cauchy matrix of (2.39) and
| · | is the operator matrix norm based on the Euclidean vector norm. Then

Taking into account that Φ(0) = I and T is an orthogonal matrix, we obtain
U (k)(0)

(2.39). Hence

Estimate (2.37) follows now from the last two inequalities, if we put β1(t; k) =
|Ψ (t)|/∥Ψ (t)∥. Note that the existence of two constants, bounding β1, is a conse-
quence of the equivalence of any two norms in the ﬁnite-dimensional space.
In order to prove the lower estimate (2.38), consider the Cauchy matrix W for the
following system which is the adjoint of (2.27):
dw
dt = −A(t)∗w.
(2.40)
Since the identity Φ(t)∗W(t) ≡I holds, by Proposition 2.1 we see that αn(t)−1 ≥

Applications to Orbital Stability
In this subsection we consider only the continuous time case. Suppose that
({ϕt}t∈R+, Rn, | · |) is a semi-ﬂow generated by the equation
˙u = f (u)
(2.45)

with the C1-vector ﬁeld f : Rn →Rn. A solution of (2.45) starting in p for t = 0 is
denoted by u(·, p). Clearly, then ϕ(·)(·) ≡u(·, ·).
We introduce some notations [7, 11, 43].
Deﬁnition 2.7
(1) A solution u(·, p) of (2.45) is called orbitally stable or Poincaré stable if for any
ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for any q ∈Bδ(p) the inequality
dist(u(t, q), γ +(p)) < ε ,
∀t ≥0
is satisﬁed.
(2) If in addition to (1) there exists an η > 0 such that for each q ∈Bη(p) the relation
dist(u(t, q), γ +(p)) →0 as t →+∞
holds, then the solution u(·, p) is said to be asymptotically orbitally stable or
asymptotically Poincaré stable.
(3) We say that the solution u(·, p) of (2.45) has an asymptotic phase if there exists
an η1 > 0 such that for any solution u(·, q) of (2.45) with
dist(q, γ +(p)) < η1 a constant Δ can be found such that
|u(t + Δ, q) −u(t, p)| →0 as t →+∞.
(2.46)
Proposition 2.19 If an orbitally stable solution u(·, p) of (2.45) has an asymptotic
phase, then it is asymptotically orbitally stable.
Proof For t ≥|Δ| we have
dist (u(t, q), γ +(p)) = inf
t1≥0 |u(t, q) −u(t1, p)|
≤|u(t, q) −u(t −Δ, p)| .
(2.47)
From (2.47) and (2.46) we obtain limt→+∞dist (u(t, q), γ +(p)) = 0 .

Suppose that Eq.(2.45) has a T -period solution u. Consider the variational equa-
tion along this solution
˙v = Df (u(t))v .
(2.48)
Let Φ(·) be the fundamental matrix of (2.48) with Φ(0) = I. Recall that Φ(T ) is
the monodromy matrix of (2.48) and the eigenvalues of Y(T ) are the multipliers of
the period solution u(·). Denote them by ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρn assuming that |ρ1| ≥|ρ2| ≥
· · · ≥|ρn| .
A basic result for multipliers is the following
Proposition 2.20 At least one of the multipliers of the periodic solution u is equal
to one.

2.4 Logarithmic Matrix Norms
71
Proof The function ξ(t) := f (u(t)) is a solution of the variational equation (2.48).
It follows that ξ(t) = Φ(t)ξ(0). Furthermore we have ξ(0) = f (u(0)) = ξ(T ). But
this implies that ξ(0) = Φ(T )ξ(0).
□
For completeness let us state the following Andronov-Vitt theorem [1].
Theorem 2.3 Suppose that (2.45) has a T -periodic solution u with multipliers
ρ1, ρ2, . . . , ρn. If ρ1 = 1 and |ρ j| < 1, j = 2, 3, . . . , n, then u is asymptotically
orbitally stable and has an asymptotic phase.

ρ1ρ2 = det Y(T ) = exp
 # T

[λ1(u(t)) + λ2(u(t))] dt

(2.50)
According to Proposition 2.20 one of the multipliers of u is equal to one. Hence,
from (2.50) it follows that the second multiplier has an absolute value less than
one.
□
Now we state and prove a higher-dimensional analogy of the Poincaré criterion
[5, 46].
Theorem 2.4 Suppose that u is a T -period solution of (2.45). Suppose also that
there exists a logarithmic norm Λ such that
# T
0
Λ(Df (u(t))[2]) dt < 0 .
(2.51)
Then the solution u is asymptotically orbitally stable and has an asymptotic phase.
Proof Let Y(·) be the fundamental matrix of the variational system (2.48), let
α1(t) ≥· · · ≥αn(t) be the singular values of Y(t), and let |ρ1(t)| ≥· · · ≥|ρn(t)| be
the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Y(t). Using Proposition 2.6, and Proposition
2.18, and also condition (2.51), we obtain
|ρ1(mT )| |ρ2(mT )| ≤α1(mT )α2(mT ) < 1

72

Singular Values, Exterior Calculus and Logarithmic Norms
for sufﬁciently large integer m > 0. Since Y(mT ) = Y(T )m, we have |ρi(mT )| =
|ρi(T )|m . Therefore, |ρ1(T )| |ρ2(T )| < 1 and, consequently, |ρi(T )| < 1, i = 2,
. . . , n. Now the result follows from Theorem 2.3.
□
If the logarithmic norm is deﬁned in terms of the Euclidean norm, then we obtain
the following result [34, 46].
Corollary 2.12 Let u be a T -periodic solution to the system (2.45), and let the
following inequality hold:
# T
0
[λ1(u(t)) + λ2(u(t))] dt < 0 .
(Hereλ1(u) ≥λ2(u) ≥· · · ≥λn(u)denotetheeigenvaluesof 1
2[Df (u) + Df (u)∗]).
Then the solution u is asymptotically orbitally stable and has an asymptotic phase.
We have noted above that in the case n = 2 inequality (2.49) is equivalent to the
Andronov-Vitt condition. In higher-dimensional case this is not true as is shown in
the next example.
Example 2.5 Let us consider Lanford’s system which was derived in [23] for the
simulation of turbulence in a ﬂuid:
˙x = (ν −1)x −y + xy ,
˙y = x + (ν −1)y + yz ,
(2.52)
˙z = νz −(x2 + y2 + z2) .
Here ν denotes a parameter. One directly checks that this equation has for
ν ∈( 1
2, 1) the periodic solution u(t; ν) = (R(ν) cos t, R(ν) sin t, ν −1) , where
R(ν) =
√
−2ν2 + 3ν −1 . It was shown in [23] that the Andronov-Vitt condition
holds for all ν ∈( 1
2, 2
3), and consequently for each value of ν from this interval the
solution u(·; ν) is asymptotically orbitally stable and has an asymptotic phase.
Let us try to use Corollary 2.11: The symmetrized Jacobi matrix of the right-hand
side of Lanford’s system (2.52) with respect to the solution u(·; ν) has the form
⎛

2ν −2

Its eigenvalues are 0 and 1

2

(3ν −2)2 + R2. Therefore, we have
λ1 + λ2 = 3ν −2 +

7ν2 −9ν + 3 .
As it is easy to see, the inequality λ1 + λ2 < 0 is not true for any value ν ∈( 1
2, 1).

The Yakubovich-Kalman Frequency Theorem
2.5.1
The Frequency Theorem for ODE’s
In the present subsection we shall discuss frequency-domain theorems for ODE’s
and some other related systems. Let us note that frequency-domain theorems can
be considered as generalizations of the well-known Lyapunov theorems for the sol-
vability of a matrix equation. For a proof see [55].
Theorem 2.5 (Lyapunov) Suppose A ∈Mn(K) is Hurwitzian. Then for any matrix
G = G∗∈Mn(K) there exists a unique solution P = P∗∈Mn(K) of the matrix
equation A∗P + P A = G.
If G is negative deﬁnite then P is positive deﬁnite.
Theorem 2.6 (Lyapunov) Suppose A ∈Mn(C) is a given square matrix with eigen-
values λ1, . . . , λn satisfying the inequalities λk + λ j ̸= 0 for all k, j = 1, . . . , n.
Then for any G ∈Mn(C) the equation
A∗P + P A = G
has a unique solution P ∈Mn(C).
From Theorem 2.6 immediately follows:
Corollary 2.13 Suppose A is as in Theorem 2.6. Then the inequality
2 Re (Au, Pu)n < 0,
∀u ∈Cn
has a solution P ∈Mn(C).
Let us now consider pairs of matrices (A, B), where A is a (complex or real)
matrix of order n × n and B is a (complex or real) matrix of order n × m. Consider
also an arbitrary Hermitian form F(u, ξ) of vectors u ∈Cn and ξ ∈Cm, i.e.
F(u, ξ) = (F1u, u)n + 2Re (F2ξ, u)n + (F3ξ, ξ)m .
(2.53)
Here F1, F3 are Hermitian matrices of order n × n, m × m respectively, F2 is a
matrix of order n × m. The scalar products (norms) in Kn and Km are denoted by
(·, ·)n(| · |n) and (·, ·)m(| · |m), respectively. In applications the matrices A and B,
and also the coefﬁcients of the form F(u, ξ) are usually real. This case is called in
the sequel the real one. The form F(u, ξ) is given in this case for real vectors u ∈Rn,
ξ ∈Rm. Then the form F(u, ξ) deﬁned by (2.53) is the extension of the real form to
a Hermitian one.
We now introduce the following deﬁnitions [27, 55].
Deﬁnition 2.8 The pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) is called
controllable, if the rank of matrix (B, AB, A2B, . . . , An−1B) is equal to n.

Deﬁnition 2.9 A pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) is called
stabilizable if there exists an n × m matrix E such that the matrix A + BE∗is
Hurwitzian, i.e. all its eigenvalues are located to the left of the imaginary axis.
The two following theorems are called frequency-domain theorems of Yakubovich-
Kalman [27, 48, 54].
Theorem 2.7 Let the pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) be
controllable. For the existence of a Hermitian n × n matrix P, real in the real case,
such that for all u ∈Cn, ξ ∈Cm the inequality
2 Re (Au + Bξ, Pu)n −F(u, ξ) ≤0,
is satisﬁed it is necessary and sufﬁcient that
F[(iωI −A)−1Bξ, ξ] ≥0
for all ξ ∈Cm and ω ∈(−∞, ∞) with det(iωI −A) ̸= 0.
Theorem 2.8 Let the pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) be
stabilizable. For the existence of a Hermitian n × n matrix P, real in the real case,
and such that for all u ∈Cn and ξ ∈Cm with |u|n + |ξ|m ̸= 0 the inequality
2 Re (Au + Bξ, Pu)n −F(u, ξ) < 0
is satisﬁed, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that there exists an ε > 0 such that
F(u, ξ) ≥ε(|u|2
n + |ξ|2
m)
for all u ∈Cn, ξ ∈Cm and for all ω ∈(−∞, ∞) with det(iωI −A) ̸= 0, which are
connected by the equality
Au + Bξ = iωu.
In the case that the matrix A does not have pure imaginary eigenvalues, for the
existence of a Hermitian matrix P real in the real case, it is necessary and sufﬁcient
that the inequality
F[(iωI −A)−1Bξ, ξ] > 0
holds for all ξ ∈Cm, ξ ̸= 0, and all ω ∈(−∞, ∞) and
lim
ω→±∞F(iω −A)−1Bξ, ξ) > 0 ,
∀ξ ∈Cm .
Theorems 2.7 and 2.8 give conditions for the existence of a Hermitian matrix
P. But sometimes we need information about the spectrum of this matrix. For this
purpose the two following lemmata seem to be useful.

2.5 The Yakubovich-Kalman Frequency Theorem
75
Lemma 2.6 Let an n × n matrix A and a Hermitian n × n matrix P satisfy the
matrix inequality
A∗P + P A < 0.
Then for the positive deﬁniteness of the matrix P it is necessary and sufﬁcient that
the matrix A is Hurwitzian.
In order to formulate the second lemma let us introduce the notion of observability.
Deﬁnition 2.10 The pair (A, C) with A ∈Mn(K) and C ∈Mn,m(K) is called
observable, if the rank of the matrix (C, A∗C, (A∗)2C, . . . , (A∗)n−1C) is equal to n.
Lemma 2.7 Let the pair (A, C) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and C ∈Mn,m(K) be
observable and the Hermitian n × n matrix P satisfy the inequality
2 Re (Au, Pu)n ≤−|C∗u|2
m ,
∀u ∈Cn.
Then the given matrix A does not have eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, det P ̸= 0,
and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix P is equal to the number of
eigenvalues of the matrix A located to the right of the imaginary axis. (Eigenvalues
are counted with respect to their multiplicity.)
The proof of Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 and also of Lemmata 2.6 and 2.7 can be found
in [55].
2.5.2
The Frequency Theorem for Discrete-Time Systems
The ﬁrst result in this subsection concerns the solvability of a matrix equation which
is useful for the investigation of discrete-time systems. The proof of the following
theorem can be reduced to Theorem 2.5.
Theorem 2.9 (Lyapunov) Suppose A ∈Mn(K) is a matrix having all eigenvalues
strongly inside the unit circle. Then for any matrix G = G∗∈Mn(K) there exists a
unique solution P = P∗∈Mn(K) of the matrix equation
A∗P A −P = G .
If G is negative deﬁnite then P is positive deﬁnite.
Let us state in this subsection a variant of the frequency-domain theorems which
is useful for the investigation of discrete-time systems and which is also called the
Kalman–Szegö theorem [4, 55].
Theorem 2.10 Let the pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) be
controllable and let F be a Hermitian form. For the existence of a Hermitian n × n
matrix P, satisfying the inequality

(P(Au + Bξ), Au + Bξ)n −(Pu, u)n −F(u, ξ) ≤0
(2.54)
for all u ∈Cn and ξ ∈Cm, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the inequality
F[(λI −A)−1Bξ, ξ] ≥0
is satisﬁed for all ξ ∈Cm and λ ∈C such that det(A −λI) ̸= 0.
Proof At ﬁrst, we prove the sufﬁciency. Let us choose a number z ∈C, |z| = 1,
such that det(A + zI) ̸= 0 and put
A0 := (A −zI)(A + zI)−1,
B0 :=

(2.56)
Inequality (2.54) in this notation takes the form
2 Re (A0υ + B0ξ, Pυ)n −F(u, ξ) ≤0 ,
∀υ ∈Cn, ∀ξ ∈Cm .
It is easy to check that the pair (A0, B0) is controllable. According to Theorem 2.6,
the existence of the desirable matrix P is equivalent to the inequality F ≥0 for all
υ = (iωI −A0)−1B0ξ ,
∀ξ ∈Cm ,
∀ω ∈R : det(ωI −A) ̸= 0 .
It can easily be seen that the last equality is equivalent to the relation
u = (λI −A)−1Bξ
for λ = z 1+iω
1−iω, ω ∈R. Thus, the sufﬁciency is proved.
The necessarity follows immediately from the identity
F(Bλξ, ξ) ≡0 for |λ| = 1,
where F(u, ξ) = 2 Re (A0u + B0ξ, Pu)n and Bλ = (λI −A)−1B.
□
Using the following result one gets more information about the matrix P, deter-
mined by Theorem 2.10.
Lemma 2.8 Let P = P∗, A and C be matrices of order n × n, n × n and n × m,
respectively, and let the pair (A, C) be observable. Suppose that the inequality
(P Au, Au)n −(Pu, u)n ≤−|C∗u|2
m

2.5 The Yakubovich-Kalman Frequency Theorem
77
is satisﬁed for all u ∈Rn. Then A has no eigenvalues on the unit circle, det P ̸= 0
and the number of negative (resp. positive) eigenvalues of P is equal to the number
of eigenvalues of A, which lie outside (resp. inside) the unit circle.
Theorem 2.11 Let the pair (A, B) of matrices A ∈Mn(K) and B ∈Mn,m(K) be
stabilizable and let F be a Hermitian form. For the existence of a Hermitian n × n
matrix P, satisfying the inequality
(P(Au + Bξ), Au + Bξ)n−(Pu, u)n −F(u, ξ) < 0
,
∀u ∈Cn, ∀ξ ∈Cm :|u|n + |ξ|m ̸= 0 ,
(2.57)
it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the inequality
F((λI −A)−1Bξ, ξ) > 0 ,
∀ξ ∈Cm, |ξ| ̸= 0 , ∀λ ∈C : det(A −λI) ̸= 0
(2.58)
is satisﬁed.
Proof The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.10.

In this subsection we derive by frequency-domain techniques lower and upper esti-
mates for the singular values α1(t) ≥α2(t) ≥· · · ≥αn(t) of the Cauchy matrix Φ(·)

where A(·) is a continuous real n × n matrix valued function on R+. The main
references for this subsection are [31, 33, 35].
Let us start with two lemmas. Consider a constant symmetric n × n matrix M1
having at least k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} negative eigenvalues, the quadratic form V1(υ) =
(υ, M1υ)n (υ ∈Rn), and the set G1 = {υ ∈Rn|V1(υ) < 0}.
Lemma 2.9 If for a scalar continuous function Θ1(·) on R+ and any point z ∈G1
the inequality
(A(t)z, M1z)n + Θ1(t)(z, M1z)n ≤0 ,

Consider now system (2.59) with the matrix A(t) = A + Bψ(t), i.e. the system
˙υ = [A + Bψ(t)] υ .
(2.65)
Here A and B are constant real matrices of order n × n and n × l, respectively, ψ(·) is
a continuous on R+ real l × n matrix-valued function. Consider for k = 1, 2, . . . , n
the Hermitian forms Fk(u, ξ) (u ∈Cn, ξ ∈C l). Suppose that for these forms there

Using Lemma 2.10, by an analogous proof we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 2.13 Let the pair (A, B) be controllable, the pairs (A, Fk) be observable,
and let for some numbers β1 ≥β2 ≥· · · ≥βn the following conditions hold:

Convergence in Systems with Several Equilibrium
States
2.7.1
General Results
Suppose that ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system with more than one equilibrium
state. This implies that none of them can be globally asymptotically stable. Never-
theless, it may be interesting to know whether every semi-orbit approaches one of
the equilibrium points. For such systems an oscillatory behaviour is excluded. It is
well-known that if the dynamical system is generated by a gradient ﬁeld of a function
F(x) which tends to inﬁnity as |x| →+∞and has ﬁnitely many critical points then
every solution of ˙x = −gradF(x), tends to one of these critical points. This leads to
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.11 Suppose ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system with the set of
equilibria C. The positive semi-orbit γ +(p) is said to converge to an equilibrium q
if ϕt(p) →q as t →+∞and is said to converge to the set C if dist(ϕt(p), C) →0
as t →+∞.
Remark 2.4 Thedynamicalsystemiscalledquasi-gradientﬂow-likeifeachpositive
semi-orbit converges to the set C, but is called gradient ﬂow-like if each positive semi-
orbit converges to an equilibrium [22, 36].

2.7 Convergence in Systems with Several Equilibrium States
85
Let us start with a general Lyapunov-type result for the gradient-ﬂow-behaviour
[49]. For time-continuous systems in Rn this result has been obtained in [55].
Theorem 2.18 Suppose that ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) is a dynamical system generated in
the continuous-time case by (1.5, Chap. 1) and in the discrete-time case by (1.6,
Chap. 1). Suppose also that the set of equilibria C of the dynamical system consists
of isolated points only and there exists a continuous function V : M →R such that
the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) V is proper w.r.t. M, i.e. for any compact set K ⊂R the set V −1(K) ⊂M is
compact;
(b) V (ϕt(p)) is non-increasing in T+ along any motion ϕ(·)(p);
(c) If ϕ(·)(p) is a motion for which there exists a τ ∈T+, τ > 0, such that
V (ϕτ(p)) = V (p) then ϕ(·)(p) is an equilibrium.
Then each positive semi-orbit of ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) converges to the set of equilibria.
If the time is continuous then each positive semi-orbit converges to an equilibrium.
Proof Suppose ϕ is an arbitrary motion. By assumption b) we have V (ϕt(p)) ≤
V (p), ∀t ∈T+. From this and assumption a) it follows that the positive semi-orbit
γ +(p) is bounded and the ω-limit set ω(p) ̸= ∅. Since the function t →V (ϕt(p))
is bounded and non-decreasing there exists the limit

t→+∞V (ϕt(p)) = c .
(2.87)
Suppose q ∈ω(p) is arbitrary. It follows from Proposition 1.4, Chap. 1, that
ϕt(q) ∈ω(p), ∀t ∈T+. From (2.87) we conclude that V (ϕt(q)) = c, ∀t ∈T+.
From assumption c) we see that ϕt(q) ≡q. This means that ω(p) ⊂C. Suppose that
for a motion ϕ we have ϕt(p) ↛C for t →+∞. This means that there exist an α > 0
and a sequence tk →+∞as k →+∞such that dist (ϕtk(p), C) > α, k = 1, 2, . . . .
From the last property it follows that ϕ has at least one ω-limit point outside C. But
this is a contradiction. If the time is continuous, the ω-limit set ω(p) is connected.
Since ω(p) ⊂C, this limit set is a single point.

Corollary 2.14 Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.18 the set C of equilibria is a
global minimal attractor for the system.
We derive now sufﬁcient conditions for the convergence behaviour of the system
˙υ = w ,
˙w = −g(υ, w) + z∗C f (υ) −φ(υ) ,
˙z = Az + B f (υ)w ,
(2.88)
where A is a constant Hurwitzian n × n matrix, i.e. a matrix whose eigenvalues have
a negative real part. B and C are constant n × m matrices, f : R →Rm is a C1-
function, φ and g are scalar-valued C1-functions on R resp. R × R. Let us assume
that with some κ0 > 0 we have g(υ, w) ≥κ0w2, ∀(υ, w) ∈R2.
We suppose that system (2.87) has only isolated equilibrium states and any solu-
tion exists on R+.

Note that some models of an induction motor [42] can be written in the form
(2.88). In case when f and φ are periodic system (2.88) describes also mathematical
models of synchronous machines [36].
Let us show that the Lorenz system (1.12), Chap.1 for r > 1 can be also written
in the form (2.88). Recall that for 0 < r < 1 the Lorenz system has the globally
asymptotical equilibrium (0, 0, 0). For r > 1 we can use the change of variables

and the new time t →

n = m := 1,

f (υ) := υ,
φ(υ) := (1 −β A−1)υ3 −υ,
κ0 := εσ + 1

and β := ε2σ −b

.
Consider now the general system (2.87) and introduce for all s ∈C with
det(sI −A) ̸= 0 the matrix function
W(s) := C∗(sI −A)−1B .
The next theorem is due to [30].
Theorem 2.19 Suppose that there is a positive number κ such that the inequality
κ0κ−1I −Re W(iω) > 0,
∀ω ∈[−∞, +∞]
(2.89)
is true. Then each bounded positive semi-orbit of a solution u = (υ, w, z) of (2.88)
which satisﬁes the condition
lim sup
t→+∞
| f (υ(t))|2 < κ
converges to an equilibrium.
Proof Let us show that with the quadratic form F(z, ξ) = κ0κ−1|ξ|2 −(Cξ, z) there
exists an n × n matrix P = P∗such that the inequality
2(Az + Bξ, Pz) −F(z, ξ) < 0 ,
(2.90)

2.7 Convergence in Systems with Several Equilibrium States

holds for all z ∈Rn and ξ ∈Rm with |z| + |ξ| ̸= 0. According to the Yakubovich-
Kalman theorem (Theorem 2.7) for this it is sufﬁcient that the pair (A, B) is stabi-
lizable and the inequality
F

(iω −A)−1Bξ, ξ

> 0,
∀ξ ∈Cm ,
ξ ̸= 0 ,
∀ω ∈[−∞, +∞]
(2.91)
is true.
The pair (A, B) is stabilizable since A is a Hurwitzian matrix.
Condition (2.91) is equivalent to the inequality
ξ ∗
κ0κ−1I −Re W(iω)

ξ > 0 ,
∀ξ ∈Cm ,
ξ ̸= 0,
∀ω ∈[−∞, +∞] ,
which is true by hypothesis (2.89).
Putting now ξ = 0 in (2.90) and taking into account that A is Hurwitzian, by
Lemma 2.6, we get P > 0.
Inequality (2.90) implies the existence of a δ > 0 such that
2(Az + Bξ, Pz) −κ0κ−1|ξ|2 + (Cξ, z) ≤−δ|z|2 , ∀z ∈Rn,
∀ξ ∈Rm.
(2.92)
Introduce the function
V (υ, w, z) = (Pz, z) + 1
2w2 +

φ(σ) dσ .
It follows from relation (2.92) that any solution u(t) =

(2.88) satisﬁes for t ≥0 the estimate
˙V (u(t)) ≤−δ|z(t)|2 + κ0κ−1| f (υ(t))w(t)|2 −(C f (υ(t))w(t), z(t))
−g(υ(t), w(t))w(t) + (C f (υ(t))w(t), z(t)) −φ(υ(t))w(t) + φ(υ(t))w(t)

= −δ|z(t)|2 −κ0w(t)2(1 −κ−1| f (υ(t))|2) .
(2.93)
This means that in the case when the positive semi-orbit of a solution u = u(·, p) =
(υ(·, p), w(·, p), z(·, p)) of (2.88) is bounded and satisﬁes
lim sup
t→+∞
| f (υ(t, p))|2 < κ ,
(2.94)
the function V

u(t, p)

does not increase on a certain interval (t0, +∞). From this
and the boundedness of V

u(t, p)

it follows that there exists a ﬁnite limit
lim
t→+∞V

u(t, p)

= c .

88

Singular Values, Exterior Calculus and Logarithmic Norms
Since the positive semi-orbit of u(·, p) is bounded the set ω of its ω-limit points is
non-empty. Let q ∈ω be arbitrary. Then the solution u(·, q) satisﬁes u(t, q) ∈ω for
all t ≥0. Consequently, V

u(t, q)

= c for all t ≥0. Condition (2.94) also implies
that | f (υ(t, q))|2 < κ for t ≥0. From this and (2.93) it follows that z(t) ≡0 and
w(t, q) ≡0. From (2.88) and w(t, q) ≡0 we conclude that θ(t) ≡const. Thus, we
see that ω consists of equilibrium states of system (2.88). But this is a contradiction,
since we supposed that system (2.88) has only isolated equilibrium states.
□
2.7.2
Convergence in the Lorenz System
Let us apply Theorem 2.19 to the Lorenz system. In the notation of system (2.88)
we have W(s) = 2 β(A −s)−1A−1 and, consequently,
W(iω) = 2β
A
A −iω
A2 + iω2 ,
ω ∈R.
Since Re W(iω) < 2 β/A2 , inequality (2.89) holds if
β < κ0 A2(2κ)−1 .
The last inequality can be written as
2 σ −b < (σ + b)b2
2 σ(r −1) κ−1 .
(2.95)
Now, from (2.95), the dissipativity of the Lorenz system, and Theorem 2.19 we obtain
the following result [30].
Theorem 2.20 Suppose that a solution u =

x, y, z

of the Lorenz system (1.12),
Chap. 1 satisﬁes the condition
(2 σ −b) lim sup
t→+∞
x(t)2 < b2(σ + 1) .
(2.96)
Then the positive semi-orbit of this solution converges to some equilibrium state.
The next result shows that the upper limit in Theorem 2.20 can be effectively
estimated.
Lemma 2.13 Suppose that l is deﬁned by (1.20), Chap.1.
Then each solution u = (x, y, z) of system (1.12), Chap.1 satisﬁes the estimate
lim sup
t→+∞
x(t)2 ≤l2r2 .

2.7 Convergence in Systems with Several Equilibrium States
89
Proof From (1.18, Chap. 1) we have the estimate
lim sup
t→+∞

y(t)2 + (z(t) −r)2
≤l2r2 .
Now we consider the two sets
G1 :=
'
x, y, z| y2 + (z −r)2 ≤l2r2,
x > lr
(
and G2 :=
'
x, y, z| y2 + (z −r)2 ≤l2r2,
x < −lr
(
.
Let us show that if at a certain time t we have (x(t), y(t), z(t)) ∈G1 then ˙x(t) < 0. If
weassumetheoppositefromtheﬁrst equationof system(1.12), Chap.1it follows that
y(t) ≥x(t) > lr. Thus, y(t)2 + (z(t) −r)2 > l2r2 . But this inequality contradicts
the assumption that the considered solution belongs to G1 at the time t.
Analogously one proves that if at a time t the solution belongs to G2 then
˙x(t) > 0.
□
From Theorem 2.20 and Lemma 2.13 we directly obtain that under the condition
2 σ −b < b2(σ + 1)
l2r2
any positive semi-orbit of the Lorenz system converges to an equilibrium.
As a special case from this follows the well-known Yudovich condition [47] for
the convergence of positive semi-orbits of the Lorenz system to an equilibrium point.
Corollary 2.15 Suppose that 2 σ −b < 0 then any positive semi-orbit of the Lorenz
system converges to an equilibrium.
Remark 2.5 For σ = 10 and b = 8/3 Theorem 2.20 guarantees the convergence of
positive semi-orbits of the Lorenz system for r < 2. This result will be essentially
improved later on.
Consider now an example that demonstrates the convergence behaviour for a
concrete physical system.
Example 2.6 The equation of motion of a director n in the dynamics of nematic
liquid crystals can be written as the [21]
d
dt n = [Ω, n] ,
I d
dt

n, d
dt n

= −γ Ω + χ (H, n) [n, H] .
(2.97)
Here Ω and H are 3-dimensional vectors, I, γ and χ are positive constants, (·, ·)
and [·, ·] denote the scalar and vector products, respectively. In [21] the Eqs.(2.97)
were investigated numerically in the scalar variables ξ = (H, n), η = (H, [Ω, n])
and ζ = |Ω|2. In these variables we can write the system (2.97) as

90
2
Singular Values, Exterior Calculus and Logarithmic Norms
˙ξ = η ,
˙η = −γ I −1η −ζξ + χ I −1ξ(|H|2 −ξ 2) ,
(2.98)
˙ζ = −2 γ I −1ζ + 2 χ I −1ξη .
Making in (2.98) the change of variables [3]
(ξ, η, ζ) →

γ
4√Iχ x ,
γ 2
8 I√Iχ (y −x) ,
γ 2

4 )
	
and t →2I
γ t, we obtain the new system
˙x = −x + y,
˙y = (1 + 4 Iγ −2χ|H|2)x −y −xz,
˙z = −4 z + xy.
(2.99)
Thus, Eq.(2.98) is transformed into the Lorenz system (1.12), Chap.1 with σ = 1,
b = 4, and r = 1 + 4Iγ −1χ|H|2.
Obviously, the Yudovich condition 2σ −b < 0 is satisﬁed for (2.99). This means
that each positive semi-orbit of system (2.99) tends to one of the equilibria (0, 0, 0)
or (±|H|, 0, 0). Chaotic behaviour as was found in numerical simulations in [21] for
Eq.(2.99) is not possible.
Remark 2.6 The numerical study of the Lorenz system (1.12), Chap.1 has shown a
very complicated behaviour of orbits for certain values of parameters. In this remark
we give some of the numerical results [40, 45] relating to bifurcations in system
(1.12), Chap.1.
The simplest analysis of system (1.12, Chap.1) shows that for 0 < r ≤1 the
system has the unique equilibrium state u1 = (0, 0, 0). For r > 1 however two states
u2,3 =

±√(r −1)b, ±√(r −1)b,r −1

arise.
If we linearize system (1.12), Chap.1 near the equilibrium u1, the Jacobian matrix
at u1 will have eigenvalues, which can be found from the equation
(λ + b)

λ2 + (σ + 1)λ + σ(1 −r)

= 0.
For r < 1 all three eigenvalues are negative, for r > 1 one value is negative and the
two others are positive. Consequently, for r > 1 the point u1 is a saddle equilibrium.
The Jacobian matrices of system (1.12), Chap.1 being linearized near the equi-
librium states u2,3 have eigenvalues which are deﬁned by the equation
λ3 + (σ + b + 1)λ2 + (r + σ)bλ + 2σb(r −1) = 0.
For r > 1 it has one negative root and two complex conjugate roots. The complex
conjugate values become purely imaginary if the product of coefﬁcients of λ2 and λ
is equal to the constant term, i.e., for r = σ(σ+b+3)
σ−b−1 .

2.7 Convergence in Systems with Several Equilibrium States
91
Lorenz [40] carried out his numerical experiments for σ = 10, b = 8/3, and
changing r. Assuming that σ and b have the values mentioned, we consider the
following sequence of bifurcations which are basic in the further account.
r < 1.
The equilibrium state u1 is a global attractor. In other words, any orbit of system
(1.12), Chap.1 tends to the origin as t →+∞.
1 < r <≈13.926.
Two new equilibria u2 and u3 arise. Together with the equilibrium u1 they form
a global attractor, i.e., any orbit of system (1.12), Chap.1 tends to one of these
equilibrium states as t →+∞.
r ≈13.926.
Two homoclinic orbits arise, which issue out of the point u1 by a one-dimensional
unstable manifold and enter the point u1 by a two-dimensional stable manifold. One
of these orbits enters the half-space x > 0, the other enters the half-space x < 0.
Each of these orbits is also called a separatrix loop of the saddle.
13.926 ≈< r < 24.74 = σ(σ+b+3)
σ−b−1 .
Two homoclinic orbits turn into heteroclinic orbits. One of them, which issues out
of the point u1 into the subspace x > 0, enters u2. The other, which issues out of the
point u1 into the subspace x < 0, enters u3.
r > 24.74.
The so-called Lorenz attractor arises. This is a global attractor. In a simpliﬁed form,
we may locally represent it as the product of a piece of smooth two-dimensional
surface and a Cantor set. Due to its very complicated and unusual structure it is
called a “strange” attractor.
Lorenz [40] has studied this attractor in detail by numerical methods in the case
r = 28. At the present time the parameters values σ = 10, b = 8/3, and r = 28 have
become canonical values. They are repeatedly used in publications connected with
system (1.12), Chap.1. We shall further refer to them as to Lorenz’s values.

Chapter 3
Introduction to Dimension Theory
Abstract In Chap.2 the dimension of a vector space was deﬁned as the maximal
number of linearly independent vectors existing in it. The simplest example of an
n-dimensional space, whose dimension is understood in this sense, is the space Rn.
The dimension theory, which was developed in the early 20th century, has extended
this conception to more general classes of spaces and sets. In the following we give a
short introduction into important notions of dimension for sets in general topological
or metric spaces. We restrict ourselves to those dimensions and their properties which
are especially useful in the investigation of ODE’s.
3.1
Topological Dimension
We start our discussion of some elements of dimension theory with the deﬁnition of
topological dimension. The notion of topological dimension in general topological
spaces can be considered from different points of view. In the present section the
topological dimension will be characterized in two ways:
The ﬁrst one is connected with an inductive approach, the idea of which goes back
to Poincaré [41] and the exact deﬁnition is given by Brouwer [7, 8], Urysohn [50]
and Menger [34, 35]. On the basis of this inductive deﬁnition the main properties of
topological dimension are obtained.
The second approach is due to Lebesgue [31]. The covering dimension is deﬁned
by the minimal order of arbitrary ﬁness for the given topological space. Since for
separable metric spaces both deﬁnitions coincide we call its common value brieﬂy
topological dimension.
All deﬁnitions and results stated in this section are standard in topological dimen-
sion theory. Most of them one can ﬁnd in the monographs [2, 12, 24].

Introduction to Dimension Theory
3.1.1
The Inductive Topological Dimension
Let M be a topological space. Denote by ∂Z the boundary of an arbitrary subset
Z ⊂M. By deﬁnition we have ∂Z = Z ∩(M \ Z), where Z denotes the topolog-
ical closure of a set Z ⊂M. If Z is open, then it is obvious that ∂Z = Z \ Z.
In the following deﬁnition [7, 34, 35] n ≥0 is an integer number.
Deﬁnition 3.1 The value ind M is called small inductive dimension of the space
M, if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) ind M = −1 if and only if M = ∅;
(2) ind M ≤n if for any point p ∈M and any neighborhood U of p there exists
an open set V with p ∈V ⊂U, mboxsuchthat ind ∂V ≤n −1;
(3) ind M = n if ind M ≤n and not ind M ≤n −1;
(4) ind M = ∞if ind M ≤n is not true for any n.
The topology of M induces in each subset Z ⊂M the relative topology: a set
U′ ⊂Z is by deﬁnition open in Z if there can be found a set U open in M and such
that U′ = U ∩Z. It follows that for each subset Z of M considered as topological
space the value ind Z is also deﬁned.
Example 3.1 It can be easily seen that R and any interval have the small inductive
dimension 1.
Example 3.2 The space Rn has the small inductive dimension n. By induction on
n it is easy to verify that the inequality ind Rn ≤n holds. The proof of the opposite
inequality is non-trivial and is not given here (see [12, 24]).
Let us consider now the main properties of the small inductive dimension. The
standard references for this representation are [2, 12, 24].
The following statement immediately follows from Deﬁnition 3.1.
Proposition 3.1 Let M1 and M2 be homeomorphic topological spaces. Then
ind M1 = ind M2.
Proposition 3.2 Let M be a topological space and ind M = n < ∞. Then for any
integer m, −1 ≤m ≤n, the space M contains some subset of small inductive dimen-
sion m.
Proof Since ind M ≥n −1, we can ﬁnd a point p0 ∈M and a neighborhood U0 of
this point which possesses the following property: if V is an arbitrary open set with
p0 ∈V ⊂U0, then
ind ∂V ≥n −1.
(3.1)
On the other hand, since ind M ≤n, there can be found an open set V0 such that
p0 ∈V0 ⊂U0 and ind ∂V0 ≤n −1. Since inequality (3.1) is satisﬁed for any neigh-
borhood of the point p0 which is in U0, it is also true for V0, i.e., ind ∂V0 ≥n −1.

3.1 Topological Dimension
97
Consequently, the boundary of V0 is a subset of the space M and has the small
inductive dimension n −1.
Repeating this process if necessary we shall obtain the desired subset of the
required dimension.
□
Proposition 3.3 Suppose that Z ⊂M and ind M ≤n. Then ind Z ≤n.
Proof For n = −1 the statement is obvious. Suppose that it is true for n −1, n ≥0
integer. Let ind M ≤n and p ∈Z. Also let U′ be a neighborhood of p in Z. It means
that there exists a neighborhood U of the point p in M such that U′ = U ∩Z. Since
ind M ≤n, there can be found a set V, which is open in M and such that
p ∈V ⊂U
and ind ∂V ≤n −1.
Let V′ = V ∩Z. Then V′ is open in Z, p ∈V′ ⊂U′. Suppose that B is the boundary
of V in M and B′ be the boundary of V′ in Z (B = V \ V and B′ = (V
′ \ V′) ∩Z).
Then B′ ⊂B ∩Z. According to the induction hypothesis ind B′ ≤n −1.
□
For the next step, it is useful to consider in some detail a very important special
case of a space having a zero small inductive dimension.
By Deﬁnition 3.1 the equality ind M = 0 means that any point p ∈M has arbi-
trary small neighborhoods with empty boundary, i.e. for any neighborhood U of the
point p there can be found an open set V such that
p ∈V ⊂U
and ∂V = ∅.
Proposition 3.4 Let M be a metric space with metric ρ. If the space M is at most
countable, then ind M = 0.
Proof Let p be an arbitrary point of M, U be an arbitrary neighborhood of this
point. Choose a number ε > 0 such that Bε(p) ⊂U. Let p1, p2, . . . be the points of
M. Obviously, there can be found a positive number ε′ < ε such that ε′ ̸= ρ(p j, p)
for all j. But in this case a ball Bε′(p) is contained in U and its boundary is empty. □
Example 3.3 The set Q of rational numbers in R has the small inductive dimension
zero.
Example 3.4 The set I of irrational numbers has the inductive dimension zero.
Really, let U be an arbitrary neighborhood of an irrational point p. Let us choose
the irrational numbers p1 and p2 such that p1 < p < p2 and a set V consisting of
the irrational numbers which are from U between p1 and p2. In the space I of the
irrational numbers the set V is open and has an empty boundary, since any irrational
point, which is a limit point of V, lies between p1 and p2 and, consequently, belongs
to V.
Example 3.5 The set I2 of all points in the plane with irrational coordinates has the
small inductive dimension zero. More generally, the set In of all points of Rn, with
irrational coordinates, is zero-dimensional.

98

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Really, any point of the plane is in arbitrary small rectangles bounded by straight
lines, which are perpendicular to the axes and intersect them at the points with
rational coordinates. The boundaries of these rectangles do not intersect I2. The
same reasoning would also be valid in the general case In.
The union of sets with small inductive dimension zero may be non zero-
dimensional. This shows the decomposition of the straight line into sets of rational
and irrational numbers
R = Q ∪I.
On the other hand (Examples 3.1, 3.3 and 3.4) we have
ind R = 1, ind Q = 0 and ind I = 0.
This is the reason why we need an additional assumption in the following formula
on dimension of the union of zero-dimensional sets. We give this formula without
proof (see [24]).
Proposition 3.5 Let Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . , be some subsets of the topological
space M and M = ∪jZ j . If the sets Z j are closed and ind Z j = 0, then ind M = 0.
Example 3.6 Suppose that 0 < m ≤n are natural numbers. Denote by Qn
m the set
of points from Rn having exactly m rational coordinates. Then ind Qn
m = 0. Indeed
for any m indices j1, j2, . . . , jm, chosen from numbers 1, 2, . . . , n, and m rational
numbers r1,r2, . . . ,rm, the system of equations
u j1 = r1,
u j2 = r2, . . . ,
u jm = rm
deﬁnes a (n −m)-dimensional linear subspace. Denote by Z j the subset of this
subspace consisting of points, all other coordinates of which are irrational. Each
Z j is isometric with In−m and, consequently, has the small inductive dimension 0
(Example 3.5). It is clear that Z j is closed in Qn
m and that the union of sets Z j
coincides with Qn
m. It follows that ind Qn
m = 0 by virtue of Proposition 3.5.
Let us return to arbitrary topological spaces and consider the small inductive
dimension of the union of sets in the general case. But at ﬁrst we shall prove a useful
proposition.
When investigating the inductive dimension of subsets in a space M, it will
sometimes be convenient to deﬁne their dimension by neighborhoods with respect to
the whole subspace M. In the next proposition we consider subspaces of completely
normal spaces. Recall that a topological space M is called completely normal if for
any subsets A and B with A ∩B = ∅, A ∩B = ∅there can be found a closed set
C and disjunct sets U and V such that M \ C = U ∪V, A ⊂U, B ⊂V. Any metric
space M is completely normal (see, for example, [43]).
Proposition 3.6 Suppose that M is a completely normal topological space and
Z ⊂M is a subset. Then ind Z ≤n if and only if any point from Z has arbitrary

3.1 Topological Dimension
99
small neighborhoods in M such that the intersection of their boundaries with Z has
dimension ≤n −1.
Proof Suppose that Z satisﬁes the conditions of the proposition. Let us show that
in this case ind Z ≤n. Let p be an arbitrary point of Z, U′ be a neighborhood of
this point in Z. Then there exists a neighborhood U of the point p in M such that
U′ = U ∩Z. Consequently, in M there can be found an open set V such that
p ∈V ⊂U,
ind (∂V ∩Z) ≤n −1.
Let V′ := V ∩Z. Then V′ is an open set in Z, p ∈V′ ⊂U′. Denote by B and B′ the
boundaries of V in M and the boundaries of a set V′ in Z, respectively. It is clear
that B′ ⊂B ∩Z. This means that ind B′ ≤n −1 and it follows that ind Z ≤n.
Suppose now that ind Z ≤n and let us show that Z satisﬁes the conditions of the
proposition. Let p ∈Z, U be a neighborhood of this point in M. Then U′ = U ∩Z
is a neighborhood of p in Z. Therefore a neighborhood V′ of the point p in Z can
be found such that
p ∈V′ ⊂U′,
ind B′ ≤n −1,
where B′ is a boundary of V′ in Z. None of the disjunct sets V′ and Z \ V
′ contains
limit points of the other set. Since M is completely normal, there can be found an
open set W such that
V′ ⊂W,
W ∩(Z \ V
′) = ∅.
Replacing, if it is necessary, W by the intersection W ∩U, one can suppose that
W ⊂U. The set W \ W = ∂W does not contain any points from V′ and from Z \ V
′.
It follows that the intersection of Z with ∂V is contained in B′ and, consequently
(Proposition 3.3), has the small inductive dimension ≤n −1. Thus, the conditions
of the proposition are satisﬁed.
□
Let us now prove a proposition concerning the small inductive dimension of
the union of two sets. As it was noted above (see Example 3.5), the small inductive
dimension of Z1 ∪Z2 is in general not determined by the small inductive dimensions
of the sets Z1 and Z2. Nevertheless the following proposition holds.
Proposition 3.7 For any two subsets Z1, Z2 of the topological space M the
inequality
ind (Z1 ∪Z2) ≤1 + ind Z1 + ind Z2
is satisﬁed.
Proof Let us make use of a double induction on the dimensions of subsets Z1 and
Z2. The proposition is obvious in the case of ind Z1 = ind Z2 = −1.
Let ind Z1 = m, ind Z2 = n. Suppose that the inequality holds if one of the two
conditions

100

Introduction to Dimension Theory
ind Z1 ≤m
and
ind Z2 ≤n −1,
or
ind Z1 ≤m −1
and
ind Z2 ≤n
is satisﬁed. Let p ∈Z1 ∪Z2. Suppose that p ∈Z1. Let U be a neighborhood of p
in M. By Proposition 3.6 there can be found an open set V such that
p ∈V ⊂U,
ind (W ∩Z1) ≤m −1,
where W is the boundary of V. Since W ∩Z2 is a subset of Z2, it follows that
ind (W ∩Z2) ≤n. By the induction hypothesis we have
ind

≤m + n.
By Proposition 3.6 it can be concluded that
ind (Z1 ∪Z2) ≤m + n + 1.
□
The following result is important for deducing a small inductive dimension esti-
mate of a minimal set of a differential equation.
Proposition 3.8 Let Z ⊂Rn. Then ind Z = n if and only if Z contains an inner
point.
In order to prove this proposition we need a lemma, whose proof will be omitted
(see [24]).
Lemma 3.1 For any two countable and dense subsets A and B in Rn there exists a
homeomorphism of the space Rn, which maps A on B.
Proof of Proposition 3.8 Suppose that p is an inner point of Z. Let us choose
ε > 0 such that Bε(p) ⊂Z. But Bε(p) is obviously homeomorphic to Rn and, con-
sequently, ind Bε(p) = n. Therefore ind Z = n.
Let ind Z = n. Now let us show that Z has an inner point. Suppose the opposite.
Then the supplement of the set Z, which we denote by G, is dense in Rn. Since Rn can
be represented as the union of rational balls (i.e. balls whose radii and coordinates of
their centers are rational), it follows that having considered non-empty intersections
of such balls with the set G and having chosen one point from G in each ball, we
obtain a countable dense set in G. Denote it by G0. From the density of G in Rn it
follows that G0 is also dense in Rn. By Lemma 3.1 the sets Rn \ G0 and Rn \ Qn are
homeomorphic. Here Qn is a subset of Rn, consisting of all points having rational
coordinates. Having used the notation of Example 3.6, we represent the complement
to the set Qn as a union of zero-dimensional sets
Rn \ Qn = Qn
0 ∪Qn
1 ∪· · · ∪Qn
n−1.

3.1 Topological Dimension
101
Since each Qn
j is zero-dimensional, by Proposition 3.7 we obtain
ind (Rn \ Qn) ≤n −1. Further, we have
ind Z = ind (Rn \ G) ≤ind (Rn \ G0) = ind (Rn \ Qn) ≤n −1.
Thus, we have arrived at a contradiction to the assumption that ind Z = n. This
contradiction concludes the proof.
□
Let us formulate two more propositions (see the proof in [2]).
Proposition 3.9 For a topological space M ̸= ∅we have ind M ≤n if and only if
M can be represented as the union of (n + 1) subspaces, i.e.
M = ∪n
j=0M j
and ind M j = 0, j = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Example 3.7 In the notation of Example 3.6 we have the decomposition
Rn = ∪n
j=0Qn
j
with ind Qn
j = 0, j = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Proposition 3.10 Suppose that (M, ρ) and (M′, ρ′) are two separable metric
spaces one of which is compact. Then ind(M × M′) ≤ind M + ind M′.
3.1.2
The Covering Dimension
Let us consider now the deﬁnition of a topological dimension which is based on
the use of covers of the given space. For the class of separable metric spaces this
deﬁnition gives the same value as the inductive dimension. The proof of this fact
can be found in the monograph [2]. The contents of Sect. 3.1.2 follows the standard
representation [12, 24].
Let M be a topological space. Let U be some set of subsets of M. We say that U
is a cover of M, if for any point p ∈M there exists a subset U ∈U such that p ∈U.
A cover U is said to be open (closed) if all its sets are open (closed).
Deﬁnition 3.2 A cover V is called a reﬁnement of U (we say also that V reﬁnes
U) if for any V ∈V there exists U ∈U such that V ⊂U. The property, that V is a
reﬁnement of U, is written as U ≺V.
Deﬁnition 3.3 Let n ≥0 be an integer number. We shall say that a cover U has the
multiplicity ≤n if any n + 1 sets from U have empty intersection. If a cover U has
the multiplicity ≤n but has not the multiplicity ≤n −1, then we say that U has the
multiplicity n.

102

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Deﬁnition 3.4 For each topological space M the covering dimension Cov M is a
value which is characterized in the following way:
(1) Cov M ≤n if any ﬁnite open cover of the space M has a ﬁnite
open reﬁnement with a multiplicity ≤n + 1;
(2) Cov M = n if the inequality Cov M ≤n is true and Cov M ≤n −1
is not true;
(3) Cov M = ∞if Cov M ≤n is not true for any n.
It follows immediately from Deﬁnition 3.4 that if M = ∅, then Cov M = −1
(since an order of a cover consisting of an empty set is zero).
Let us suppose that (M, ρ) is a compact metric space, i.e., consider a situation
which is given in many applications.
We now prove a useful lemma which will be used not only in this section but also
in section devoted to the topological entropy.
Lemma 3.2 For an arbitrary open cover U of the compact metric space M there
exists a number ε > 0 such that any subset U of the space M having diameter less
than ε is contained in some elements of the cover U.
Proof If such number ε does not exist, then for any natural number n a subset Un ⊂
M with the diameter < 1/n can be found, which is not contained in the elements of
the cover U. When a point pn is chosen arbitrarily in Un, consider the set {pn}. Since
M is compact, we see that this set has at least one limit point p0. Let be p0 ∈U0 ∈U
and let δ be a distance from p0 to M \ U0. If n > 2/δ and ρ(p0, pn) < δ/2, then
ρ(p0, p) ≤ρ(p0, pn) + ρ(pn, p) ≤δ
2 + 1
n < δ
for any point p ∈Un. It means, contrary to the supposition, that Un ⊂U0.
□
The number ε, which can be found in Lemma 3.2 is called the Lebesgue number
of the cover U.
A cover U of a metric space M is called an ε-cover if the diameter of each set
from U is less than ε.
Proposition 3.11 The inequality Cov M ≤n is true if and only if for any ε > 0
there exists a ﬁnite open ε-cover of the space M having the multiplicity ≤n + 1.
Proof According to Lemma 3.2, if ε is the Lebesgue number of the cover U, then
any ε-cover V is inscribed in U.
□
Proposition 3.12 The inequality Cov M ≤n is true if and only if for any ε > 0
there exists a ﬁnite closed ε-cover of the space M with multiplicity ≤n + 1.
Proposition3.12 immediately follows from Proposition3.11 and the following
lemma.

3.1 Topological Dimension
103
Lemma 3.3 Let ε > 0 be an arbitrary positive number. For the existence of a ﬁnite
open ε-cover of the space M with multiplicity ≤n the existence of the ﬁnite closed
ε-cover of the space M with multiplicity ≤n is necessary and sufﬁcient.
Proof LetU = {U1, U2, . . . , Um}beanopenε-coverofthespaceMwithmultiplicity
≤n. Let us construct a ﬁnite closed ε-cover with multiplicity ≤n. For this purpose
we consider the supplement to the open set U2 ∪U3 ∪· · · ∪Um. Denote this closed
set by C1. It is obvious that it can be covered by the set U1 and there can be found an
open set V1 such that C1 ⊂V1 ⊂U1. Assume that the open sets V1, V2, . . . , Vk−1 be
already chosen. Let us construct a set Vk. Denote by Ck the closed set, which is the
supplement to the union
V1 ∪· · · ∪Vk−1 ∪Uk+1 ∪· · · ∪Um.
It is clear that Ck can be covered by the set Uk and it is possible to ﬁnd an open set Vk
such that Ck ⊂Vk ⊂Uk. Obviously, the cover {V1, V2, . . . , Vm} is a desirable closed
ε-cover of multiplicity ≤n.
Conversely, assume that there exists a closed ε-cover U = {U1, U2, . . . , Um} of
the space M with multiplicity ≤n. Let us show the existence of the corresponding
open cover. For an arbitrary δ > 0 denote by Ui(δ) the open δ-neighborhoods of the
sets Ui, i = 1, 2, . . . , m. We now choose an arbitrary subsystem
Sδ = {Ui1(δ), Ui2(δ), . . . , Uin+1(δ)},
1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < in+1 ≤m.
Let us show that for sufﬁciently small δ the intersection of sets, which are a part
of it, is empty. Indeed, suppose the opposite. Then for any natural number j and
for δ j = 1/j a point a j can be found such that it belongs to all sets of the system
Sδ j. By the compactness of the space M there exists a point a such that it is a limit
point of the sequence {a j}, and by virtue of the fact that the cover U is closed, this
limit point must belong to the intersection of the sets {Ui1, Ui2, . . . , Uin+1}. But this
contradicts to the property that the multiplicity of U is ≤n. The number of subsystems
of the type Sδ is ﬁnite. Therefore, taking for δ0 the least of numbers δ we obtain a
cover {U1(δ0), U2(δ0), . . . , Um(δ0)} of the space M with multiplicity ≤n. Since the
diameter of each closed set Ui is less than ε, we can choose δ0 > 0 so small that the
diameter of each set Ui(δ0) will be, moreover, less then ε. It is clear that the cover
{U1(δ0), U2(δ0), . . . , Um(δ0)} is the desired open ε-cover of multiplicity ≤n.
□
Propositions 3.11 and 3.12 permit us to reformulate Deﬁnition 3.4 for compact
metric spaces:
Deﬁnition 3.5 Suppose that (M, ρ) is a compact metric space. Then the covering
dimension CovM is a number which is characterized by the following properties:
(1) Cov M ≤n if for any ε > 0 there exists an open (closed) ε-cover of the space
M with multiplicity ≤n + 1;

104
3
Introduction to Dimension Theory
(2) Cov M = n if Cov M ≤n and for some ε > 0 the space M does not have an
open (closed) ε-cover of multiplicity ≤n;
(3) Cov M = ∞if Cov M ≤n is not true for any n.
Example 3.8 Consider the Cantor set Z := ∞
j=0 Z j, where
Z0 := [0, 1],
Z1 := [0, 1]\ (1/3, 2/3) = [0, 1/3] ∪[2/3, 1] ,
Z2 := [0, 1/9] ∪[2/9, 3/9] ∪[6/9, 7/9] ∪[8/9, 1],
...
Thus we have Z0 ⊃Z1 ⊃· · · and each Zn, n = 1, 2, . . . , is the union of 2n intervals
of length 1/3n (Fig. 3.1). We shall show that Cov Z = 0.
Let ε > 0 be an arbitrary number. Choose the integer number j > 0 such that
3−j < ε. Then the closed intervals forming the set Z j give a closed ε-covering
of multiplicity ≤1. Therefore Cov Z ≤0. The inverse inequality is obvious since
Z ̸= ∅.
We ﬁnish this section with a proposition which is proved, for example, in [2].
Proposition 3.13 Suppose that (M, ρ) is a separable metric space. Then
ind M = CovM.
This leads to the following:
Deﬁnition 3.6 Suppose (M, ρ) is a separable metric space. The topological dimen-
sion dimT M of M is given by dimT M := ind M = Cov M.

The Hausdorff Measure and the Hausdorff Dimension
This subsection presents the main properties of the Hausdorff measure and the Haus-
dorff dimension introduced in [4, 20]. The treatment of this subsection may be found
in the books [13, 14, 40, 44].
Suppose that (M, ρ) is a metric space, Z is an arbitrary subset of M and d ≥0,
ε > 0 are numbers. Let us cover Z by at most a set of countable many balls Br j of
radii r j ≤ε and deﬁne the Hausdorff premeasure at level ε and of order d
μH (Z, d, ε) := inf

⎭,
where the inﬁmum is taken over all such countable ε-covers of Z and the convention
that inf ∅= +∞. It is obvious that for ﬁxed Z and d the function μH (Z, d, ε) does
not decrease with decreasing ε. Thus there exists the limit (which may be inﬁnite)
μH (Z, d) := lim
ε→0+0 μH (Z, d, ε) = sup
ε>0
μH (Z, d, ε).
In the following proposition we show that {μH (·, d)} is a family of metric outer
measures on M.
Proposition 3.14 Foranyﬁxedd ≥0 thefunctionμH (·, d)isametricoutermeasure
on M, i.e., it possesses the following properties:
(1) μH (∅, d) = 0;
(2) μH (Z1, d) ≤μH (Z2, d) for all sets Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M;
(3) μH (
j≥1 Z j, d) ≤
j≥1 μH (Z j, d) for all sets Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . .
Proof Let us note that for any d ≥0 and ε > 0 the function μH (·, d, ε) is a metric
outer measure on M: We have μH (∅, d, ε) = 0 and for arbitrary sets Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M
it follows that μH (Z1, d, ε) ≤μH (Z2, d, ε) since any ε-cover of Z2 is also an ε-cover
of Z1. In order to prove the third property of a metric outer measure we consider two
cases.
Case 1: There exists an i0 ≥1 with μH (Zi0, d, ε) = +∞. It follows that
μH (

Zi, d, ε) ≥μH (Zi0, d, ε) = +∞.
Case 2: For all i ≥1 we have μH (Zi, d, ε) < +∞. Suppose that δ > 0 is an arbitrary
number. For any i ≥1 we choose a countable ε-cover of Zi consisting of balls with

To
ﬁnish the proof of the proposition let us note that if M = {m} is a family of metric
outer measures on M than Z ⊂M →μ(Z) := sup
m∈M
m(Z) deﬁnes also a metric
outer measure on M. In the present situation this family of metric outer measures is
given by M := { μH (·, d, ε)}.
□
Deﬁnition 3.7 The function μH (·, d) is called Hausdorff-d-measure on M.
Proposition 3.15 (1) For any ﬁxed Z ⊂M the function μH (Z, ·) has exactly one
critical value
dcr = dcr(Z) ∈[0, ∞] such that
μH (Z, d) = ∞
for any 0 ≤d < dcr
and μH (Z, d) = 0
for any d > dcr .
(3.2)
(2) If M = Rn, then dcr (Rn) ≤n.
Proof (1) We distinguish two cases.
Case 1: There exists a value d ≥0 with μH (Z, d) < +∞. Take arbitrary δ > 0 and
ε > 0 and consider μH (Z, d + δ, ε) = inf{

= εδμH (Z, d, ε). It follows that
μH (Z, d
′) = 0 for all d
′ > d.
(3.3)
Thus, we can deﬁne the critical value satisfying (3.2) as
dcr(Z) := inf{d | μH (Z, d) < +∞}.
Case 2: For any d ≥0 we have μH (Z, d) = +∞. Here we deﬁne dcr(Z) := +∞.
(2) Let M = Rn. Let us show that in this case dcr ≤n. Denote by C an arbitrary
cube in Rn with edges of length 1. Take a natural number k > 0 and divide C into kn
cubes with edges of length 1/k. Each of these cubes is contained in a ball of radius
1
2k−1√n. Thus, if ε ≥1
2k−1√n, then
μH (C, n, ε) ≤kn1
2k−1√n
n
= 2−nnn/2.
It follows that μH (C, n) < ∞and by (3.3) we have μH (C, d) = 0 for all d > n.
Since Rn can be represented as a countable union of such cubes, we obtain
μH (Rn, d) = 0 and, consequently, μH (Z, d) = 0 (here the fact that μH (·, d) is an

outer measure has been used). Then d > dcr and, since d is an arbitrary number
greater than n, we get dcr ≤n.
□
Deﬁnition 3.8 For any set Z ⊂M the value
dimH Z = dcr(Z) = inf{d ≥0 | μH (Z, d) = 0} = sup{d ≥0 | μH (Z, d) = ∞}
is called the Hausdorff dimension of the set Z.
Remark 3.1 In the above deﬁnition of the Hausdorff dimension one can choose
coverings of the set Z by at most countable many sets U j of diameter ≤ε to obtain
the same value of the Hausdorff dimension.
By using Proposition 3.15, we can draw the graph of the function μH (Z, ·) on R+
(for the case 0 < dcr < +∞and μH (Z, dcr) < +∞see Fig.3.2)
In practical dimension estimations the following properties of the Hausdorff
dimension of a set Z ⊂M (metric space) are useful:
(P1)
μH (Z, d) > 0 ⇒dimH Z ≥d ;
(P2)
dimH Z > d ⇒μH (Z, d) = +∞;
(P3)
μH (Z, d) < +∞⇒dimH Z ≤d ;
(P4)
dimH Z < d ⇒μH (Z, d) = 0 .
Let us consider two examples in which the Hausdorff dimension can be immediately
calculated by Deﬁnition 3.8.
Example 3.9 Consider again the Cantor set Z from Example 3.8
Let us show that μH (Z, d) = 1, where d = log 2/ log 3 = 0.6309 . . . and, con-
sequently, dimH Z = log 2/ log 3.

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Since Z can be covered by 2 j closed intervals of length 3−j, which form the set
Z j, taking into account that 3d = 2, we have
μH (Z, d, 3−1) ≤2 j(3−j)d = 2 j2−j = 1.
Thus, we get μH (Z, d) ≤1 as j →+∞.
We now prove the inverse inequality. For this purpose we need to show that if I
is an arbitrary set of intervals covering Z, then
1 ≤

J ∈I
|J |d.
(3.4)
Here | · | is the length of the interval J . Because of the compactness of Z, it is
sufﬁcienttoprovethatinequality(3.4)issatisﬁedundertheassumptionthatIconsists
of the ﬁnite number of intervals. Let J be some interval from I. Without loss of
generality it can be supposed that J contains intervals, a pair J, J ′, which take part
in the construction of Z. Further we shall suppose that in J the intervals J and J ′ are
the intervals of maximal length. Let J ′′ = J \ (J ∪J ′). Obviously, |J ′′| ≥|J| |J ′|.
Therefore,
|J |d = (|J| + |J′| + |J′′|)d ≥

2(|J| + |J′|)
d

1
2|J|d + 1
2|J′|d
≥|J|d + |J′|d.
Here we make use of the facts that the function t →td is concave and 3d = 2. Thus,
the replacement of J in (3.4) by two closed intervals J and J ′ does not increase
the sum in (3.4). Continuing in the same way, i.e., replacing J by intervals J and
J ′, after a ﬁnite number of steps we obtain a covering of Z by intervals of the same
length, for example, 3−j. This covering must include all intervals which compose
Z j and therefore we have

J ∈I
|J |d ≥2 j(3−j)d = 1.
Remark 3.2 It remains to note that the Cantor set is the simplest example of a set
having a non-integer Hausdorff dimension, the value of which can be computed
precisely. Sets of a more complicated structure, such as the strange attractor of a
dynamical system, also have non-integer Hausdorff dimension, but in this case often
there can be found only estimates of its dimension.
For ‘regular’ sets the Hausdorff dimension has an integer value which is intuitively
clear. This can be shown by the following example.
Example 3.10 Let in R3 a smooth surface S be given by
S = {(x, y, z) | z = f (x, y),
(x, y) ∈C}

3.2 Hausdorff and Fractal Dimensions
109
where f (·, ·) is a continuously differentiable function on the unit square C of the
plane. We shall show that dimH S = 2.
Let {Br j} be an ε-cover of the surface S. The projection of balls Br j on the (x, y)-
plane form an ε-cover of the square C consisting of discs. A ball Br j of radius r j is
projected on a disc having the area πr2
j . Thus, we have  πr2
j ≥1, i.e., r2
j ≥π−1.
Consequently, μH (S, 2) > 0 and dimH S ≥2.
Let us now show that dimH S ≤2. Since f is continuously differentiable, there
can be found a number M > 0 such that
| f (u′) −f (u′′)| ≤M|u′ −u′′|,
∀u′, u′′ ∈C.
(3.5)
We choose an integer number k > 0 and divide in an obvious way the square C into
k2 equal squares with sides 1/k. By (3.5), each part of the surface S being placed
above by such small square, may be embedded into a cube with the edge length M/k,
which is included in a ball of radius
√

2 M/k. Thus, the surface S is covered by cubes
and, if

μH (S, 2, ε) ≤k2

It follows that μH (S, 2) < ∞and, consequently, dimH S ≤2.
The following proposition gives some basic properties of the Hausdorff dimen-
sion.
Proposition 3.16 Suppose (M, ρ) is a metric space. Then the following statements
are true:
(1) dimH ∅= 0;
(2) dimH Z ≥0 for any Z ⊂M; if M = Rn and Z ⊂Rn then dimH Z ≤n;
(3) dimH Z1 ≤dimH Z2 for any sets Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M;
(4) dimH (
j≥1 Z j) = sup j≥1 dimH Z j for any sets Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . ;
(5) If the set Z ⊂M is at most countable, then dimH Z = 0.
Proof The validity of (1)–(3) follows directly from the deﬁnition of the Hausdorff
dimension. Assertion (5) results from (4).
It remains to show the validity of (4). Let d′ = sup j dim Z j. Suppose that d′ < ∞
and we take an arbitrary d > d′. Then dim Z j < d and, consequently, μH (Z j, d) = 0
for j ≥1. Using the fact that μH (·, d) is an outer measure, we obtain
μH

μH (Z j, d) = 0.
Then dimH (
j≥1 Z j) ≤d. Therefore, by virtue of arbitrariness of d > d′, we have
dimH (
j≥1 Z j) ≤d′. The validity of the inverse inequality follows directly from (3),

since Z j ⊂
i≥1 Zi for any j ≥1. Thus, property (4) is proved under the assumption
d′ < ∞. The case d′ = ∞is trivial.
□
In studying ordinary differential equations the change of variables is often used.
The following proposition shows that the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set in
the phase space of such a system is invariant with respect to a smooth transformation
of the phase variables.
Proposition 3.17 Suppose that K ⊂Rn is a compact set, U with K ⊂U is an open
set and Φ: U ⊂Rn →Φ(U) is a diffeomorphism. Then
dimH K = dimH Φ(K) .
Proof Let d ≥0, δ > ε > 0 be ﬁxed numbers. Denote by Br(u) the ball with radius
r and center u in Rn and let Kδ be a closed δ-neighborhood of K such that Kδ ⊂U.
Suppose that {Br j(u j)} is an arbitrary ε-cover of K. Then, since Φ is a diffeomor-
phism, there can be found a constant M1 > 0 such that
|Φ(u′′) −Φ(u′)| ≤M1|u′′ −u′| for all u′, u′′ ∈Kδ.
In particular, for u′ ∈Br j(u j) we have
|Φ(u′) −Φ(u j)| ≤M1|u′ −u j| ≤M1r j.
Consequently, the set Φ(Br j(u j)) is contained in the ball BM1r j(Φ(u j)) and we have
K ⊂
j≥1 Br j(u j). It follows that Φ(K) ⊂
j≥1 BM1r j(Φ(u j)).
Thus, for an arbitrary ε-cover of K there can be found an (M1ε)-cover of the set
Φ(K). Since

j

j = M−d


j
(M1r j)d,
we have
μH (K, d, ε) ≥M−d
1 μH (Φ(K), d, M1ε).
Therefore
μH (K, d) ≥M−d
1 μH (Φ(K), d).
Using the same line of reasoning as above, but taking the set Φ(K) vice K and
mapping Φ−1 vice Φ, we obtain
μH (Φ(K), d) ≥M−d
2 μH (K, d),
where M2 > 0 is a corresponding constant for Φ−1.

3.2 Hausdorff and Fractal Dimensions
111
Finally, we get
M−d
1 μH (Φ(K), d) ≤μH (K, d) ≤Md
2 μH (Φ(K), d).
Therefore dimH K = dimH Φ(K).
□
Remark 3.3 Proposition 3.17 follows from a more general result. Suppose that
(M, ρ) and (M′, ρ′) are metric spaces, Φ : M →M′ is a Lipschitz continuous
map, i.e., there exists a constant L > 0 such that ρ′(Φ(u), Φ(υ)) ≤Lρ(u, υ) for
any u, υ ∈M. Then for any set Z ⊂M we have dimH Φ(Z) ≤dimH Z.
Further, everywhere in this section, we shall suppose that M = Rn.
Earlier we introduced the Hausdorff d-measure, based on covers by balls. The
Hausdorff measure so deﬁned is often called spherical. However, instead of spherical
balls in the covers it is also possible to use balls of another type, as for example cubes.
Let Z be an arbitrary subset of Rn and d ≥0, ε > 0 numbers. Cover the set Z by
n-dimensional cubes having edges with length l j ≤ε and denote
μH (Z, d, ε) = inf

j
ld
j ,
where the inﬁmum is taken over all such ε-covers of Z. Let us deﬁne now the function
μH (Z, d) (cubical Hausdorff d-measure) in the same way as the spherical Hausdorff
d-measure was introduced above.
Proposition 3.18 For any Z ⊂Rn and d ≥0 the equality
μH (Z, d) = μH (Z, d)
holds.
Proof Any cube C with edges of length l can be included in a ball of radius √nl/2.
On the other hand any ball of radius l/2 is contained in an included in this cube C.
Therefore the following inequalities
μH (Z, d, √nl/2) ≤μH (Z, d,l) ≤μH (Z, d,l/2)
are true. Going to the limit as l →0, we get the desirable equality.
□
Taking into account Proposition 3.18, we shall use further the notation μH (·, ·)
both for the spherical and as cubical Hausdorff d-measure.
Denote by μL(Z, n) the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure of a measurable set
Z ⊂Rn. From the following proposition it follows that any open set in Rn has the
Hausdorff dimension n.
Proposition 3.19 If μL(Z, n) > 0 then dimH Z = n.

112

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Proof Let ε > 0 be ﬁxed and {Br j} be a countable cover of Z by balls with radius
r j ≤ε such that

j
rn
j < μH (Z, n) + ε.
Since μL(Br j, n) = cnrn
j , where cn is a constant depending only on n (the volume of
the n-dimensional unit ball), we have
μL(Z, n) ≤

j
μL(Br j, n) = cn

j
rn
j < cnμH (Z, n) + cnε.
Therefore μH (Z, n) ≥c−1
n μL(Z, n) and, consequently, μH (Z, n) > 0. From this it
follows that dimH Z ≥n. The reverse inequality results from Proposition 3.15.
□
Remark 3.4 In Example 3.10, starting directly from the deﬁnition of the Hausdorff
dimension, we found that the dimension of any piece of a smooth surface is equal to
2. Now it is clear that this fact is a simple corollary of Propositions3.17 and 3.19.
Corollary 3.1 (a) dimH Rn = n ;
(b) For any open set Z ⊂Rn we have dimH Z = n ;
(c) If (M, g) is a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold then
dimH M = n .
Proposition 3.20 Suppose that for a set Z in the separable metric space (M, ρ)
we have dimT Z = n (0 ≤n < ∞). Then μH (Z, n) > 0 and, consequently,
dimT Z ≤dimH Z.
(3.6)
Remark 3.5 The Cantor set Z gives an example which shows that inequality (3.6)
may be strictly. A fractal is a space whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than its
topological dimension. For any non-empty open set Z ⊂Rn inequality (3.6) goes
over in an equality. This property follows from Proposition 3.8 and from Proposition
3.19.Thefollowingtheoremfrom[37]establishesanimportantlinkofthetopological
dimension with the Hausdorff dimension. Let (M, ρ) be a separable metric space.
Then dimT M = inf dimH M′, where the inﬁmum is taken over all separable metric
spaces homeomorphic to M.
To prove Proposition 3.20 we need the following lemma. Denote by Sr(p) the bound-
ary of a ball Br(p). Put S′
r(p) = Sr(p) ∩Z.
Lemma 3.4 Suppose that μH (Z,l + 1) = 0 for some integer l ≥0. Then if p is an
arbitrary point of Z, then for almost all r we have μH

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Proof of Proposition 3.20 Suppose that the assertion of the proposition is not true,
i.e., μH (Z, n) = 0. If we prove that this implies the inequality dimT Z ≤n −1, then
we obtain a contradiction to the assumptions of Proposition 3.20, which proves the
assertion.
Thus, it is sufﬁcient to show that μH (Z, n) = 0 implies dimT Z ≤n −1.
We shall prove it by induction. Let n = 0. The condition μH (Z, 0) = 0 means that
Z = ∅. Indeed, if Z contains at least one point, then μH (Z, 0) ≥1. Since Z = ∅,
we see that dimT Z = −1.
Supposing that the statement is proved for n, we show the trueness for n + 1.
Suppose that μH (Z, n + 1) = 0. We have to prove that dimT Z ≤n. On the base of
Proposition 3.6 it is sufﬁcient to state that any point p ∈Z possesses in M arbitrarily
small neighborhoods such that the intersection of their boundaries with Z has the
topological dimension ≤n −1. But this directly follows from the lemma proved
above and the induction hypothesis.
□
3.2.2
Fractal Dimension and Lower Box Dimension
In this subsection we take a closer look at the fractal dimension and lower box
dimension of a set [12, 13, 29, 42].
Let (M, ρ) be a metric space and Z ⊂M be an arbitrary totally bounded set.
Recall that a set Z ⊂M is said to be totally bounded if for each ε > 0 the set Z can
be written as ﬁnite union of subsets of M with a diameter smaller than ε. According
to Hausdorff’s theorem [53] a set Z of a complete metric space M is totally bounded
if and only if Z is relatively compact. Denote by Nε(Z) the minimal number of balls
of radius ε > 0 which are necessary to cover Z.
Deﬁnition 3.9 The fractal dimension or upper box dimension of the set Z is given
by
dimF Z ≡dimBZ := lim sup
ε→0
log Nε(Z)
log 1/ε .
The lower box dimension of the set Z is deﬁned by
dimBZ := lim inf
ε→0
log Nε(Z)
log 1/ε .
If dimBZ = dimBZ := dimB Z the value dimB Z is called box dimension
of Z.
Let us give now an equivalent description of the fractal dimension of the set
Z. Let d ≥0, ε > 0 be numbers and put μB(Z, d, ε) := εd Nε(Z) (capacitive d-
measure at level ε), μF(Z, d) ≡μB(Z, d) := lim sup
ε→0
μB(Z, d, ε) (upper capaci-
tive d-measure) and μB(Z, d) := lim inf
ε→0 μB(Z, d, ε) (lower capacitive d-measure).
It is easy to see that for the functions μF(Z, ·) and μB(Z, ·) there exists, as in the
Hausdorff measure case, a critical value dcr.

3.2 Hausdorff and Fractal Dimensions
115
Proposition 3.21 For any totally bounded set Z ⊂M we have
dimBZ = inf{d ≥0| μF(Z, d) = 0} and dimBZ = inf{d ≥0 | μB(Z, d) = 0} .
Proof Let us prove the ﬁrst statement and put
d1 := inf{d| μF(Z, d) = 0},
d2 := lim sup
ε→0
log Nε(Z)
log 1/ε .
Firstly, we show that d1 ≤d2. If d1 = 0, then this statement is obvious. Then we
shall suppose that d1 > 0. For a given γ ∈(0, d1), choose a sequence of numbers
εm > 0 such that ε →0 + 0 and
∞= μF(Z, d1 −γ ) =
lim
m→+∞μF(Z, d1 −γ, εm).
Then for all sufﬁciently large m we have
εd1−γ
m
Nεm(Z) ≥1.
(3.9)
Passing if necessary to a subsequence, one can suppose that there exists the following
limit
lim
m→+∞
log Nεm(Z)
log 1/εm
≤d2.
(3.10)
By (3.9) we have
d1 ≤γ + log Nεm(Z)
log 1/εm
.
Passing to the limit as m →+∞and taking into account (3.10), we obtain d1 ≤
d2 + γ . By virtue of arbitrariness of γ it follows that d1 ≤d2.
Now we show that d1 ≥d2. Let γ > 0 be an arbitrary number. Let us choose a
sequence of numbers ε′
m > 0 such that ε′
m →0 + 0 and
d2 = −lim
m→+∞
log Nε′m(Z)
log ε′m
.
(3.11)
Passing if necessary to a subsequence, one can suppose that
0 = μF(Z, d1 + γ ) =
lim
m→+∞μF(Z, d1 + γ, ε′
m).
Then for all sufﬁciently great m we obtain
ε′
m
d1+γ Nε′m(Z) ≤1.

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Then d1 ≥−γ −log Nε′m(Z)/ log ε′
m. Passing to the limit as m →+∞and taking
into account (3.11), we get d1 ≥d2 −γ . Since γ is arbitrary, then d1 ≥d2.
□
Remark 3.6 Since the inequality μH (Z, d, ε) ≤μB(Z, d, ε) is obvious, we have

Therefore
dimH Z ≤dimBZ ≤dimF Z.
(3.12)
Example 3.11 Returning now to Examples 3.8 and 3.10 of the previous subsection,
we can easily ﬁnd that the fractal dimension of the Cantor set is log 2/ log 3 and the
fractal dimension of a smooth surface in R3 is 2. Let us demonstrate the ﬁrst fact.
Suppose {εn}∞
n=1 is a sequence of numbers with
1
2
1
3n < εn ≤1
2
1
3n−1 , n = 1, 2, . . . .
It follows from the construction of the Cantor set Z in Example 3.8 that Nεn(Z)
≤2n , n = 1, 2, . . . , and thus dimF Z ≤lim sup
n→∞
log 2n
log(2·3n−1) = log 2
log 3 . Assume now that
{εn}∞
n=1 is a sequence with 1
2
1
3n+1 ≤εn < 1
2
1
3n , n = 1, 2, . . . . It is easy to see that
each ball Bεn intersects at most one of the intervals Zn from Example 3.8. It follows
that
Nεn(Z) ≥2n , n = 1, 2, . . . ,
and thus dimBZ ≥lim inf
n→∞
log 2n
log(2·3n+1) = log 2
log 3 . Putting together the two estimates we
get
log 2
log 3 ≤dimBZ ≤dimBZ ≤log 2
log 3 .
This gives, together with the result from Example 3.8, for the Cantor set the dimen-
sions
dimH Z = dimB Z = log 2
log 3 .
Let us consider an example which demonstrates that the Hausdorff dimension and
the fractal dimension may not coincide.
Example 3.12 Let M = [0, 1] with the usual metric from R and Z = {0, 1, 1
2,
1
3, . . . }. We show that dimH Z = 0 and dimBZ = dimF Z = 1/2. Indeed, since Z
is a countable set, we have by Proposition 3.16 dimH Z = 0.

3.2 Hausdorff and Fractal Dimensions
117
Put p0 := 0 and p j := 1/j for j > 0. Let us show at ﬁrst that dimBZ ≥1/2.
Assuming an arbitrary integer number m > 0 to be ﬁxed we put εm :=

Since 1

can be covered by one interval of length 2εm. Consequently, Nεm(Z) ≥m. Thus,

It follows that dimBZ ≥1/2.

Thepoints p0, p j with j ≥m(m + 1)belongtotheinterval[0,

m(m + 1) belong to the interval [
1
m(m+1), 1
m ], which, obviously, can be covered by
m + 1 intervals of length 2ε. Consequently Nε(Z) ≤1 + m + 1 + m = 2(m + 1).
Therefore we have

Since the compact set Z is countable, we have dimH Z = 0 (Proposition 3.16). Let

The main properties of the lower and upper box dimension can be found in the
next proposition [39, 40].
Proposition 3.22 Suppose that (M, ρ) is a metric space. Then it holds:
(1) dimB∅= dimF ∅= 0;
(2) dimBZ1 ≤dimBZ2, dimF Z1 ≤dimF Z2, if Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M are totally bounded
sets;
(3) dimF

Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . , k;
(In general dimB(k
j=1 Z j) = max1≤j≤k{dimBZ j} is not true.)
(5) If the set Z ⊂M is ﬁnite, then dimBZ = dimF Z = 0;
(6) If (M′, ρ′) is a second metric space and Φ : M →M′ is a bijection such that
Φ and Φ−1 are Lipschitz then for any totally bounded set Z ⊂M we have
dimBZ = dimBΦ(Z) and dimF Z = dimF Φ(Z) ;
(7) If Z ⊂M is a totally bounded set, Z is the closure in M, then dimBZ =
dimBZ and dimF Z = dimF Z, i.e. the lower and upper box dimensions do not
distinguish between a set and its closure;
(8) If (M, g) is an n-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold, then
dimB M = n.
Proof Let us demonstrate (2). For any ε > 0 we have Nε(Z1) ≤Nε(Z2). It follows
that for all ε which are sufﬁciently small

Let us show the ﬁrst assertion of (4) and consider for simplicity the case k = 2. Since
Z1 ⊂Z1 ∪Z2 and Z2 ⊂Z1 ∪Z2 we conclude by (3) that maxi=1,2 dimF(Zi) ≤
dimF(Z1 ∪Z2). In order to prove the opposite inequality we use for Z := Z1 ∪Z2
and arbitrary ε > 0 the inequality
Nε(Z) ≤Nε(Z1) + Nε(Z2).
We know that there exists a sequence {εn}, εn →0 such that dimF Z =

log Nεn (Z)
log 1/εn

If necessary we choose a subsequence of {εn} (with the same notation) in order
to have also the two limits
βi := lim

Nεn(Z2) = Nεn(Z1)εan
n , Nεn(Z) ≤Nεn(Z1) [1 + εan

and
log Nεn(Z) ≤Nεn(Z1) + log(1 + εan

W.l.o.g. we consider β1 > β2. It follows that there exists an a > 0 and n0 > 0, n0 ∈
N, such that an ≥a, n = n0, n0 + 1, . . . . Thus we can choose a constant c1 > 0 such
that
log Nεn(Z) ≤log Nεn(Z1) + c1εan

Example 3.14 (a) Assume Z := Q ∩[0, 1] denotes the set of rational numbers in
[0, 1]. It follows from Proposition 3.22, that dimF Z = dimF Z = dimF([0, 1]) = 1 .
Since the rational numbers are countable we can write Z = {qi}∞
i=1.
Using Proposition (3.16), we conclude that dimH Z = 0. This implies that dimH Z ̸=
dimH Z = dimH ([0, 1]) = 1.
Since supi≥1 dimF{qi} = supi≥1 0 = 0, we see that assertion (3) in Proposition
3.22 is really an inequality.
Remark 3.7 Suppose that M is an arbitrary topological space. A map Φ : M →
RN is called a topological or C0-embedding if the restriction Φ : M →Φ(M) is a
homeomorphism.
It is a classical result (Menger [34], Nöbeling [37], and Hurewicz [24]) that a space
with dimT M = n < ∞can be topologically embedded in the space R2n+1 and the
set of such homeomorphisms forms a dense set Gδ (i.e., a countable intersection
of open sets.) Because of inequality (3.12), any set Z in a metric space with ﬁnite
Hausdorff dimension dimH Z can thus topologically be embedded in R[2 dimH Z+1].
(Here, [k] denotes for a real number k the smallest integer greater than or equal to
k.) Important embedding results and their relation to dimensions are presented in

120

Introduction to Dimension Theory
the book by Whitney [52]. One can construct subsets of a Hilbert space with ﬁnite
Hausdorff dimension that cannot be embedded by an orthogonal projection into RN
for any N [47]. In 1981 R. Mané [32] showed that “most” projections of a set M in a
Banach space with a ﬁnite fractal dimension dimF M onto subspaces of dimension
> dimF M + 1 are injective. “Most” means here that the set of injective projections
contains a countable intersection of dense sets in the space of all projections endowed
with the norm topology. However this does not allowed any statement on the fractal
dimension of the projected set. Ben-Artzi et al. [3] showed in the ﬁnite dimensional
case the existence of such projections whose inverse is in edition Hölder continuum
on the projected set.
This result has been generalized by Foias and Olsen [17], Robinson [46] to Hilbert
spaces. In the works of Hunt and Kaloshin [22] and Hunt et al. [23] it was shown
that the former results also can be expected generically in a probabilistic sense
which is called prevalence. In the paper of Okon [38] such an embedding result
for compacta with ﬁnite fractal dimension for Banach spaces is generalized to metric
spaces. Embedding results for dynamical systems on inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds
are shown in Reitmann and Popov [45].
3.2.3
Self-similar Sets
Let (M, ρ) be a separable complete metric space. If Φ : M →M is a map, then
the Lipschitz constant of Φ is
Lip Φ := sup
p̸=q
ρ (Φ(p), Φ(q))
ρ (p, q)
.
The map Φ is Lipschitz if Lip Φ < ∞and Φ is a contraction if Lip Φ < 1.
Let {Φ1, . . . , Φm}(m ≥2) be contractions on M. A non-empty compact set K ⊂
M is called self-similar with respect to {Φ1, . . . , Φm} if K satisﬁes the equation
K = Φ1(K) ∪· · · ∪Φm(K) .
(3.13)
One can show that (3.13) has for Lipschitz maps a unique non-empty compact solu-
tion K = K(Φ1, . . . , Φm). The Hausdorff dimension and the topological dimension
of K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) can be estimated by the following theorem [19].
Theorem 3.1 Let δ = δ(Φ1, . . . , Φm) be the unique root of the equation
m
j=1(Lip Φ j)δ = 1. Then we have
dimH K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≤δ .

3.2 Hausdorff and Fractal Dimensions
121
Proof We follow the proof in [19]. Let W m
n be the set of all ﬁnite words of length n ∈
N of m symbols {1, . . . , m}. For any w = (w1, . . . , wm) ∈W n
m we consider the set
Kw := Φw1 ◦Φw2 ◦· · · ◦Φwn(K(Φ1, . . . , Φm)).
It follows from (3.13) that
K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) =

w∈W m
n
Kw .
(3.14)
Moreover, denoting by diam Z the diameter of a set Z, we have
diam Kw ≤λn diam K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) =: εn ,
where λ := max j=1,...,m Lip Φ j < 1. Since {Kw}w∈W m
n
is a ﬁnite εn-covering of
K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) by (3.14), it follows for the corresponding outer Hausdorff mea-
sure at level εn and of order δ that
μH(K(Φ1, . . . , Φm), δ, εn) ≤

= (diam K(Φ1, . . . , Φm))δ < ∞.
Letting n →∞we have μH(K(Φ1, . . . , Φm), δ) < ∞which implies that
dimH K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≤δ.
□
A map Φ : M →M is a similitude if there is a ﬁxed 0 < r < 1 such that
ρ(Φ(p), Φ(q)) = rρ (p, q), ∀p, q ∈M.
Let the similitude Φ have a ﬁxed point a, let Lip Φ = r, and let T be the orthonormal
transformation given by T (p) := 1
r [Φ(p + a) −a]. Then Φ(p) = rT (p −a) + a.
According to [25] we write Φ = (a,r, T ) for this representation. A set of maps
{Φ1, . . . , Φm} on M satisﬁes the open set condition if there exists a non-empty open
set U such that
(i) m
j=1 Φ j(U) ⊂U , and
(ii) Φi (U) ∩Φ j(U) = ∅
if i ̸= j .
Suppose that there is a closed set C ⊂M with the interior int C ̸= ∅such that
(a) Φi(C) ⊂C
if
i = 1, . . . , m, and
(b) int Φi(C)∩int Φ j(C) = ∅
if
i ̸= j .
Then the open set condition is satisﬁed [25]. The following theorem was proved by
Moran [36] and Hutchinson [25].

Theorem 3.2 If {Φ1, . . . , Φm} is a set of similitudes of Rn and if this set satisﬁes
the open set condition, then
dimH K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) = dimB K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) = δ,
where δ is the unique solution of m
j=1 (Lip Φ j)δ = 1 .
Proof The estimate dimH K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≤δ follows from Theorem 3.1. For the
lower estimate dimH K(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≥δ see [36] or [25]. From (3.12) it follows that
δ ≤dimBK(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≤dimBK(Φ1, . . . , Φm). Using the same technique as in
the proof of Theorem 3.1 one shows that dimBK(Φ1, . . . , Φm) ≤δ.
□
Example 3.15 (a) Let {Φ1, Φ2} be similitudes Φi : R →R given by Φ1 = (0, 1
3, I)
and Φ2 = (1, 1
3, I) (I is the identity map). Then K(Φ1, Φ2) =: Z = Φ1(Z) ∪
Φ2(Z), where Z is the Cantor set (see Examples 3.8 and 3.9).
(b) Let a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 be points as shown in Fig.3.3. Let {Φ1, Φ2, Φ3, Φ4} be
similitudes of R2, where Φi : R2 →R2, i = 1, . . . , 4, is the unique similitude map-

is called Koch curve. Figure3.3 shows the approximation of K.
(c) The open set condition holds for (a) with C = [0, 1] and for (b) with C the
triangle (a1, a5, a3). It follows from Theorem 3.2 that for the set Z = K(Φ1, Φ2)
from (a) we have dimH Z = dimB K(Φ1, Φ2) = log 2/ log 3, where δ = log 2/ log 3
is the unique solution of (1/3)δ + (1/3)δ = 1.
It follows from the same theorem that for the set Z = K(Φ1, Φ2, Φ3, Φ4) from
(b) we have dimH Z = dimB Z = log 4/ log 3, where δ = log 4/ log 3 is the unique
solution of
(1/3)δ + (1/3)δ + (1/3)δ + (1/3)δ = 1 .

Dimension of Cartesian Products
The subject of this subsection is the study of dimension properties of Cartesian prod-
ucts. We follow the representation in [14, 21, 51]. Let (M, ρ) and (M′, ρ ′) be metric
spaces. We consider in the Cartesian product M × M′ the metric ρ given for arbi-
trary(p, p′), (q, q′) ∈M × M′ by ρ((p, p′), (q, q′)) :=

The next proposition is shown in [51] and we state it without proof.
Proposition 3.25 Suppose that (M, ρ), (M′, ρ′) are metric spaces, Z ⊂M and
Z′ ⊂M′ are arbitrary subsets. Then we have
dimH (Z × Z′) ≥dimH Z + dimH Z′.
Corollary 3.2 Suppose that (M, ρ), (M′, ρ′) are metric spaces, Z ⊂M and
Z′ ⊂M′ are totally bounded sets, and dimH Z′ = dimF Z′. Then
dimH (Z × Z′) = dimH Z + dimH Z′.
Proof From Proposition 3.25 it follows immediately that
dimH Z + dimH Z′ ≤dimH (Z × Z′)
and from Proposition 3.24 and the assumption of the corollary we conclude that
dimH (Z × Z′) ≤dimH Z + dimF Z′ = dimH Z + dimH Z′ .
□
Example 3.17 (a) Suppose (M, ρ) is a metric space, Z ⊂M is totally bounded
and Z′ := [a, b] ⊂R. Then we have dimH Z′ = dimF Z′ = 1 and, by Corollary 3.2,
dimH (Z × [a, b]) = dimH Z + 1 .
(b) Suppose Z is as in a) and Z′ is the Cantor set. We have shown in Examples
3.8 and 3.11 that dimH Z′ = dimF Z′ = log 2
log 3. It follows from Corollary 3.2 and also
that dimH (Z × Z′) = dimH Z + dimH Z′ = dimH Z + log 2
log 3.

3.3 Topological Entropy
125
3.3
Topological Entropy
In 1965 Adler et al. [1] deﬁned the topological entropy as an analogon of the metric
entropy introduced previously by Kolmogorov and Sinai [28, 48]. In contrast to the
last one, the topological entropy is deﬁned without using any invariant measure. An
equivalent deﬁnition of topological entropy was introduced by Bowen [5, 6] and
Dinaburg [10] using spanning and separated sets. The application of the concept of
topological entropy to one-dimensional maps is one of the best-investigated cases.
Here, for example, it is shown that the positiveness of entropy of a map is equiva-
lent to its random behaviour. The applications of topological entropy to the study of
high-dimensional discrete and continuous-time dynamical systems is less well under-
stood. However also in this case there were found some interesting connections with
dimension-like characteristics of attractors.
3.3.1
The Bowen-Dinaburg Deﬁnition
In the present subsection we shall give a deﬁnition of topological entropy and describe
its essential properties. The representation is based on the papers [5, 6, 33]. The
analysis is done in a compact metric space M with a metric ρ. We also suppose that
a continuous map ϕ : M →M is given. Let us recall that by Br(p) there is denoted
a ball of radius r with its centre p in the space M
Br(p) =

q ∈M| ρ(p, q) < r

.
For any integer number m > 0 we deﬁne in M the Bowen ball with centre in p
and radius r by the equality
Br(p, m) :=

q ∈M|
max
0≤j≤m−1 ρ

ϕ j(p), ϕ j(q)

< r

.
Since ϕ is continuous, it follows that for any ε > 0 and any integer m > 0 there
can be found a number δ > 0 such that Bδ(p) ⊂Bε(p, m). Therefore the Bowen
ball is an open set. Consequently, in virtue of compactness of M, the number of the
Bowen balls which are necessary to cover M is ﬁnite.
Let Nε(M, m) be a minimal number of such balls. It is clear that Nε′(M, m) ≤
Nε(M, m) for ε′ ≥ε. Whence it follows that the following deﬁnition is correct.
Deﬁnition 3.10 The topological entropy of the continuous map ϕ : M →M of
the compact metric space (M, ρ) is given by
htop(ϕ, M) ≡htop(ϕ) = lim

Introduction to Dimension Theory
The set P ⊂M is said to be (m, ε)-spanning set for M with respect to ϕ, if for
any p ∈M there exists an q ∈P such that p ∈Bε(q, m). The number Nε(M, m)
introduced above may be considered as the smallest cardinality of an (m, ε)-spanning
set for M with respect to ϕ.
A set R ⊂M is said to be (m, ε)-separated with respect to ϕ if for any p, q ∈R
with p ̸= q the inequality
max
0≤j≤m−1 ρ

ϕ j(p), ϕ j(q)


is satisﬁed. Let Sε(M, m) denote the largest cardinality of an (m, ε)-separated set
R ⊂M with respect to ϕ. Actually, it follows from the next lemma that both
Sε(M, m) as Nε(M, m) are ﬁnite numbers.
Lemma 3.5 Suppose that ε > 0 and m ∈N are arbitrary. Then the following
inequalities hold:
(1) Nε(M, m) ≤Sε(M, m) ≤Nε/2(M, m);
(2) Sε′(M, m) ≤Sε(M, m) for any ε′ ≥ε.
Proof Prove that Sε(M, m) ≤Nε/2(M, m). Let R be an (ε, m)-separated set, and P
be an (ε/2, m)-spanning set for M with respect to ϕ. We deﬁne a map ψ : R →P
in the following way. For p ∈R we choose some point ψ(p) ∈P such that p ∈
Bε/2

ψ(p), m

max
0≤j≤m−1 ρ



2 = ε.
Therefore p = q. Consequently, ψ is a bijective map from R on ψ(R) ⊂P. It
follows that the cardinality of R is not greater than the cardinality of P.
We now prove that Nε(M, m) ≤Sε(M, m). Let R be an (m, ε)-separated set
of a maximal cardinality Sε(M, m). Let us show that R is an (m, ε)-spanning set.
Assuming the opposite, that there exists an p ∈M such that
p /∈Bε(q, m),
for all q ∈R.
Then R ∪{p} is also an (m, ε)-separated set which contradicts the choice of R.
Thus, part (1) of the lemma is proved. Assertion (2) is obvious.

= ρ(p, q). Then htop(ϕ, M) = 0.
Indeed, for an isometry we have Bε(p, m) = Bε(p) for any p ∈M, ε > 0 and
m ∈N. In other words, each Bowen ball coincides with the usual metric ball. There-
fore Nε(M, m) does not depend on m and the result follows immediately from
deﬁnition.

Denote by Pk the set of ﬁnite sequences (ω1, ω2, . . . , ωk), consisting of 0
and 1. Obviously, the number of elements in Pk is 2k. Let l be an arbitrary
natural number. From the inequality ρ(ω, ω′) > 2−l it follows that there can be
found a j ∈{1, 2, . . . ,l} such that ω j ̸= ω′
j or, more generally, the inequality

j. Consequently, the number of elements in any (m, 2−l)-separated set R of
the space M does not exceed the number of elements in the set Pm+l. Therefore
S2−l(M, m) ≤2m+l.
Let us enumerate all elements of the set Pm and to each its j-th element ( j =
1, 2, . . . , 2m) assign an element from the space M in accordance with the rule
(ω1, . . . , ωm) →(ω1, . . . , ωm, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . ),
i.e., on the (m + j)-th place is 1, and the other elements of a ’tail’ are zero. It is clear
that the subset of M, constructed above, is an ( 1

Let ε ∈(0, 1

Using the monotonicity of the value Sε(M, m) with respect to ε, we obtain
S 1
2 (M, m) ≤Sε(M, m) ≤S2−l(M, m).
Consequently,
2m ≤Sε(M, m) ≤2m+l.

The Characterization by Open Covers
In this subsection we give a characterization of topological entropy suggested in [1].
Suppose that for an open cover U of the compact metric space (M, ρ) the expression
N(U) is the minimal number of elements of U which is necessary to cover M. For
any continuous map ϕ : M →M and any open covers U and V of M introduce the
notion
U ∨V :=

U ∩V | U ∈U, V ∈V

,
ϕ−1U :=

ϕ−1(U) | U ∈U

and
H(U) := log N(U).
Note that the product U ∨V of two covers and the preimage ϕ−1(U) are open covers
of M. Deﬁne the entropy of the map ϕ with respect to the cover U by
h(ϕ, U) :=
lim
m→+∞
1
m log N(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U).
(3.16)
In order to verify the correctness of the given deﬁnition, it is necessary to prove the
existence of the limit in the right-hand side of (3.16). This follows from the following
lemmas.
Lemma 3.6 Suppose that ϕ : M →M is continuous and U and V are open covers
of M. Then the following relations are true:
(1) ϕ−1(U ∨V) = ϕ−1U ∨ϕ−1V;
(2) H(U ∨V) ≤H(U) + H(V);
(3) H(ϕ−1U) ≤H(U);
(4) H(ϕ−1U) = H(U), if ϕ is surjective.
Proof The validity of this lemma follows directly from the deﬁnitions of U ∨V,
ϕ−1U and H(U).
□
Lemma 3.7 Let {am}m≥1 be a sequence of real numbers such that am+i ≤am + ai
for any m, i ∈N. Then the limit

Lemma 3.8 The limit in the right-hand side of (3.16) exists.
Proof By Lemma 3.6 for any natural numbers m and i we have
H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m+i−1)U)
= H

U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U ∨ϕ−m(U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(i−1)U)


≤H(U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) + H(U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(i−1)U).
Therefore the validity of Lemma 3.8 follows from Lemma 3.7, if we put for any
m ∈N
am = H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U).
□
Thus, the correctness of the deﬁnition of the entropy of ϕ with respect to U, i.e.
h(ϕ, U) is proven.
Proposition 3.27 Suppose (M, ρ) is a compact metric space and ϕ : M →M is
continuous. Then htop(ϕ, M) = sup h(ϕ, U), where the supremum is taken over all
ﬁnite open covers U of M.
Proof Denote for brevity h∗:= sup
U
h(ϕ, U), where the supremum is taken over all
ﬁnite open covers U of M.
We show at ﬁrst that h∗≤htop(ϕ, M). Let U := {U1, . . . , Ur} be some open cover
of M and δ be the Lebesgue number of U (see Sect.3.1.2). Let also P be an (m, δ/2)-
spanning set of minimal cardinality for M. For q′ ∈P, choose U j0(q′), . . . , U jm−1(q′)
in U such that

It follows that
C(q′) := U j0(q′) ∩ϕ−1
U j1(q′)

We have
M =

Thus,
N(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) ≤cardP = Nδ/2(M, m)
(3.17)
and
h(ϕ, U) ≤lim sup
m→+∞
1
m log Nδ/2(M, m).
If we let δ tend to 0, then we obtain h∗(ϕ) ≤h∗
top(ϕ, M).
In order to prove the opposite equality, suppose that a δ > 0 is given. Let us
choose for M an open cover U = {U1, . . . , Ur} such that diam (U j) < δ for all
j = 1, 2, . . . ,r. Let R be an (m, δ)-separated subset of M with maximal cardinality.
It should be noted that two elements p, q ∈R, p ̸= q can not belong to one and the
same element of U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U, since if

Thus,

If we let δ tend to 0, then we obtain h∗(ϕ) ≥htop(ϕ, M).

Some Properties of the Topological Entropy
In this subsection we shall consider some important properties of the topological
entropy of a map or of a ﬂow. Most of these properties can be found in [1, 27, 30].
Proposition 3.28 Suppose if ϕ : M →M is a homeomorphism of the compact
metric space (M, ρ). Then
htop(ϕ, M) = htop(ϕ−1, M) .
Proof By the properties (4) and (1) of Lemma 3.6 we have for any ﬁnite open cover
U of M and any natural m
H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) = H

ϕm−1(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U)

= H(U ∨ϕU ∨· · · ∨ϕm−1U) = H

U ∨(ϕ−1)
−1U ∨· · · ∨(ϕ−1)
−(m−1)U

.
Therefore h(ϕ, U) = h(ϕ−1, U) and the assertion follows from Proposition 3.27.
□
Proposition 3.29 Suppose that (M1, ρ1) and (M2, ρ2) are compact metric spaces,
ϕ j : M j →M j ( j = 1, 2) are continuous maps and χ : M1 →M2 is a homeo-
morphism such that χ ◦ϕ1 = ϕ2 ◦χ, i.e. χ is a conjugacy between ϕ1 and ϕ2. Then
htop(ϕ1, M1) = htop(ϕ2, M2). In particular, the topological entropy does not depend
on the choice of the metric.
Proof By relations (4) and (1) of Lemma 3.6 we have for an arbitrary ﬁnite open
cover U of M and arbitrary natural m
H(U ∨ϕ−1
2 U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)

U) = H

U)

= H(χ−1U ∨ϕ−1
1 χ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)

χ−1U).
Therefore, h(ϕ2, U) = h(ϕ1, χ−1U) and the assertion follows from Proposition
3.27.
□
Proposition 3.30 Suppose that ϕ : M →M is a continuous map of the com-
pact metric space (M, ρ) and Z ⊂M is a closed and ϕ-invariant subset. Then
htop(ϕ, Z) ≤htop(ϕ, M).
Proof Let U be some ﬁnite open cover of Z. For each 
U ∈U there can be found an
open subset U such that 
U = U ∩Z. A family of such sets U together with the open
set M \ Z forms a ﬁnite open cover U of the set M.
Suppose that ϕ = ϕ|Z and let m be an arbitrary natural number. Then
H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) ≤H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U).
Therefore h(ϕ,U) ≤h(ϕ, U) and the assertion follows from Proposition 3.27.

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Proposition 3.31 Suppose (M, ρ) is a compact metric space and ϕ : M →M is
continuous. Then for any natural k
htop(ϕk, M) = k htop(ϕ, M).
(3.18)
Proof If k is an arbitrary natural and U is an arbitrary ﬁnite open cover of M, then
htop(ϕk, M) ≥h(ϕk, U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(k−1)U)
=
lim
m→+∞k H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−k+1U ∨ϕ−kU ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(mk−1)U)/mk = k h(ϕ, U).
Consequently, htop(ϕk, M) ≥k htop(ϕ, M).
On the other hand, since there is the reﬁnement
U ∨(ϕk)−1U ∨· · · ∨(ϕk)−(m−1)U ≺U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(mk−1)U,
by (3.16) we have
h(ϕ, U) =
lim
m→+∞H(U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(mk−1)U)/mk ≥h(ϕk, U)/k.
And the assertion again follows the Proposition 3.27.
□
Let us consider on the metric space (M, ρ) a family of continuous maps {ϕt}t∈R,
having the following properties:
(1) ϕ0 is the identity map on M;
(2) ϕt+s(p) = ϕt
ϕs(p)

for any t, s ∈R and p ∈M;
(3) The map (t, p) →ϕt(p) is continuous on R × M.
The family {ϕt}t∈R, satisfying (1)–(3) is called C0-ﬂow in M.
For such a C0-ﬂow the following generalization of formula (3.18) is valid [6].
Proposition 3.32 Suppose{ϕt}t∈R isaC0-ﬂowonthecompactmetricspace(M, ρ).
Then for any t ∈R
htop(ϕt, M) = |t| htop(ϕ1, M).
Proof Let us show that for any t, s > 0
htop(ϕt, M) ≤t
s htop(ϕs, M).
(3.19)
From the continuity of the ﬂow it follows that
∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 ∀p, q ∈M,
ρ(p, q) ≤δ : ρ(ϕr(p), ϕr(q)) ≤ε, 0 ≤r ≤s.

Suppose P ⊂M is an (n, δ)-spanning set for M w.r.t. ϕs, i.e. assume that
∀p ∈M ∃q ∈P
ρ(p, q) ≤δ, . . . , ρ

ϕs(n−1)(p), ϕs(n−1)(q)

It follows that for all 0 ≤r ≤s
ρ(ϕr(p), ϕr(q)) ≤ε, . . . , ρ

ϕs(n−1)+r(p), ϕs(n−1)+r(q)

≤ε .
But this implies that P is an (m, ε)-spanning set for M with respect to ϕt if mt ≤

s htop(ϕs, M),
and, consequently, the inequality (3.19).
Now we can write with t > 0 and s = 1
htop(ϕt, M) ≤t htop(ϕ1, M) ≤t 1
t htop(ϕt, M) = htop(ϕt, M).
For negative t consider the map ψ := ϕ−1 and write for s = −t
htop(ψs, M) = s htop(ψ1, M) = (−t)htop(ϕ−1, M) = (−t)htop(ϕ, M)
(Propositions 3.28 and 3.31).
Since ϕ0 = idM we conclude from Example 3.18 that htop(ϕ0, M) = 0.
□
Consider again a metric space (M, ρ), a continuous map ϕ : M →M and the
associated dynamical system {ϕk}k∈Z+. A point p ∈M is said to be non-wandering
with respect to the map ϕ (or the dynamical system {ϕk}k∈Z) if for any open neigh-
borhood U of the point p and arbitrary k > 0 it can be found a natural number
m > k, m ∈N, such that ϕm(U) ∩U ̸= ∅.
We have the following result [5, 6].

Introduction to Dimension Theory
It is natural to ﬁnd a connection between the topological entropy of a map ϕ on M
and the dimension of the space M, in which ϕ acts. Such results are found for all
three types of dimensions in (3.20) (see, for example, [11, 15, 18, 26] and references
in these works). But in these cases on the continuous map ϕ the different additional
constraints are imposed. The following simple example gives a representation about
results of this kind.
Example 3.20 Suppose that ϕ : M →M is a Lipschitz continuous map, i.e., there
exists a constant λ > 0 such that
ρ

ϕ(p), ϕ(q)

≤λ ρ(p, q),
for all p, q ∈M.
Let us show that under the condition that dimF M < +∞
htop(ϕ, M) ≤max{0, log λ} dimF M.
Choose an arbitrary d > dimF M. Then
log Nδ(M)
log δ−1
< d
for all sufﬁciently small δ > 0. Let us also choose an arbitrary γ > λ and ε > 0.
Consider at ﬁrst the case λ ≥1.
The condition ρ(p, q) < γ −mε results in the following relation
ρ

ϕ j(p), ϕ j(q)

< λ jγ −mε ≤γ −(m−j)ε < ε
for j = 0, 1, . . . , m −1. Therefore Bδ(p) ⊂Bε(p, m) with δ = γ −mε. Thus,
Nε(M, m) ≤Nδ(M). Then for all sufﬁciently large m we have
log Nε(M, m)
m
≤log Nδ(M)
log δ−1
log δ−1
m
< d
 
log γ −log ε
m
!
.
Consequently htop(ϕ, M) ≤d log γ and htop(ϕ, M) ≤log λ dimF M.
If ϕ is Lipschitz with λ < 1 it also satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition with λ = 1.
From the considered case above it follows that htop(ϕ, M) = 0.
Let us return again to Examples 3.18 and 3.19. If ϕ is an isometry, then ϕ is a
Lipschitz map with λ = 1. Therefore from Example 3.20 we immediately obtain
htop(ϕ, M) = 0. If ϕ is a shift operator on the space M from Example 3.19, then ϕ
is a Lipschitz map with λ = 2. Since htop(ϕ, M) = log 2, it follows from Example
3.20 that dimF M ≥1.
The next proposition which is taken from [27] shows that the degree of a map can
give useful information on a lower bound for the topological entropy.

3.3 Topological Entropy
135
Proposition 3.34 Suppose that (M, g) is an n-dimensional compact orientable Rie-
mannian Ck-manifold and ϕ : M →M is a Cr-map (k ≥r ≥1).
Then htop(ϕ, M) ≥log | deg ϕ |.
Proof Suppose μ is a volume form on M, β ∈(0, 1) is a number and deﬁne for
p ∈M
Jϕ(p) := det Dϕ(p) , L := sup
p∈M
|Jϕ(p) |,
ε := L−
β
β−1 ,
V := { p ∈M | |Jϕ(p) | ≥ε}. Choose an open cover U with Lebesgue number
δ > 0 of V such that ϕ is injective on the elements of U. It follows that if
p, q ∈V, ρ (p, q) ≤δ then ϕ(p) ̸= ϕ(q). Fix now n ∈N and deﬁne the set
U := {p ∈M | card(V ∩{p, . . . , ϕn−1(p)} ≤βn}.
This implies that if p ∈U then
|Jϕn(p) | =
n−1
,
j=0
| Jϕ(ϕ j(p)) | < Lβn(1−β)nε = (ε1−β Lβ)n = 1.
It follows that voln(ϕn(U)) =
-
ϕn(U) μ =
-
U Jϕnμ < voln(U).
Sard’s theorem (Theorem A.3, Appendix A) guarantees us the existence of a
regular value p ∈M \ ϕn(U) of ϕn. Take now an (n, δ)-separated set in ϕ−n(p).
Since p is a regular point for ϕ, the point p has w.r.t. ϕ at least N := deg ϕ preimages
(see Sect. B.3, Appendix B). If all N points belong to V we put R1 := ϕ−n(p) ∩V.
In the other case let the set R1 contain exactly one preimage outside V. It follows
that R1 ⊂ϕ−n(p) consists of regular points of ϕ.
The same procedure will be repeated for each point q ∈R1 in order to get the
inclusions R2 ⊂ϕ−2(p), . . . , Rn ⊂ϕ−n(p).
Let us show that the set Rn is (n, δ)-separated for ϕ. Suppose q1, q2 ∈Rn are
arbitrary points and ρ(ϕk(q1), ϕk(q2)) ≤δ for k = 0, 1, . . . , n −1. Then we have
ϕn−1(q1) = ϕn−1(q2). This follows from the fact that by construction ϕn−1(q1) ∈
V, ϕn−1(q2) ∈V, δ istheLebesgue-number,and p = ϕ(ϕn−1(q1)) ̸= ϕ(ϕn−1(q2)) =
p gives a contradiction.
In the same way one shows that ϕn−2(q1) = ϕn−2(q2), . . . , q1 = q2. Since
Rn ⊂ϕ−n(p) ⊂ϕ−n(M\ϕn(A)) ⊂M\U it follows that Rn ∩U = ∅.
But this implies that for each q ∈Rn there exist at least βn time-values k ∈
{0, . . . , n −1} for which ϕk(q) ∈V. In this case cardRn ≥N m ≥N βn and
Sδ(M, n, ϕ) ≥N βn. By deﬁnition we have
htop(ϕ, M) = lim

Dimension-Like Characteristics
In this section the basic ideas of dimension-like characteristics introduced by Pesin
[39, 40] are described. This approach is based on the notion of Carathéodory measure
[9, 16]. It will be shown that Hausdorff and fractal dimensions, are special types of
such dimension-like characteristics.
It is demonstrated in [39] that the topological entropy and the topological pressure
can also be considered as dimension-like characteristics.
In Chap. 5 dimension-like characteristics are used for the estimation of Hausdorff
dimension of invariant sets. All constructions and statements, represented in this
section, can be found, together with complete proofs, in [39, 40].
3.4.1
Carathéodory Measure, Dimension and Capacity
Let M be an arbitrary set, F be some set of subsets of M, P := [d∗, +∞) for ﬁnite d∗
or P := R be a parameter set, and let the following three functions ξ : F × P →R+,
η : F × R →R+ and ψ : F →R+ be given. We shall suppose that the following
conditions are satisﬁed:
(A1)
∅∈F, ξ(∅, d) = 0, ψ(∅) = 0;
(A2)
ξ(U, d + d′) = η(U, d′)ξ(U, d),
∀U ∈F , ∀d, d′ ∈P;
(A3)
For any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for any U ∈F with ψ(U) ≤δ, it
holds η(U, d) ≤ε if d > 0 and η(U, d) ≥ε−1 if d < 0;
(A4)
For any ε > 0 there exists U ∈F for which ψ(U) = ε.
We say that Z ⊂M is an admissible set if for any ε > 0 there can be found some
ﬁnite or countable set U of subsets from F, forming a cover of Z. Moreover we have
ψ(U) = ε for any U ∈U.
We shall also suppose that one more condition is satisﬁed:
(A5)
Any subset Z ⊂M is admissible.
In analogy to [39] we call such a collection (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) which satisﬁes (A1)–
(A5) a Carathéodory (dimension) structure on M.
Let Z be an arbitrary subset of M and d ≥d∗, ε > 0 numbers. Deﬁne the
Carathéodory d-measure at level ε of Z with respect to (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) by
μC(Z, d, ε) := inf

U∈U
ξ(U, d),
where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite or countable sets U of subsets from F
covering Z and such that ψ(U) ≤ε for all U ∈U. It is obvious that μC(Z, d, ε) for
ﬁxed Z and d does not decrease with decreasing ε. It follows that there exists a limit

3.4 Dimension-Like Characteristics
137
μC(Z, d) := lim
ε→0 μC(Z, d, ε).
A simple check shows the validity of the following assertion.
Proposition 3.35 Assuming d ∈P to be ﬁxed, the function μC(·, d) is an outer mea-
sure on M, i.e. it possesses the following properties:
(1) μC(∅, d) = 0 ;
(2) μC(Z1, d) ≤μC(Z2, d) if Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M ;
(3) μC(
j≥1 Z j, d) ≤

j≥1
μC(Z j, d) for all Z j ⊂M ( j = 1, 2, . . . ) .
Deﬁnition 3.11 The function μC(·, d) is called Carathéodory d-measure with
respect to (F, P, ξ, η, ψ).
From assumptions (A1)–(A5) it can be easily seen that the following proposition
is true.
Proposition 3.36 If Z ⊂M is kept ﬁxed then for the function μC(Z, ·) there exists
dcr(Z) ∈P such that for d ∈P
μC(Z, d) = ∞
f or
d < dcr(Z),
μC(Z, d) = 0 for d > dcr(Z) .
Deﬁnition 3.12 The value dimC Z := dcr(Z) is called Carathéodory dimension of
the set Z with respect to the structure (F, P, ξ, η, ψ).
Example 3.21 For a standard Carathéodory structure let M be a separable metric
space, F the family consisting of open balls B(u,r) in M with center u and radius r
and the empty set, P = R+, ξ(B(u,r), d) = rd, η(B(u,r), s) = rs, ψ(B(u,r)) = r,
ξ(∅, d) = ψ(∅) = 0, and η(∅, s) = 1 for each u ∈M,r > 0 and each d ≥0, s ∈R.
It is easy to see that such a system (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) deﬁnes a Carathéodory structure
on M. We denote by μH(·, d,r), μH(·, d) and dimH the resulting Carathéodory
measures and Carathéodory dimension which are in fact the Hausdorff d-measure
at level r, the Hausdorff d-measure and the Hausdorff dimension, respectively, intro-
duced in Sect. 3.2.1.
Let Z be an arbitrary subset of M and d ∈P, ε > 0 numbers. Put
mC(Z, d, ε) := inf

U∈U
ξ(U, d),
where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite or countable systems U of subsets from F,
forming a cover of Z and such that ψ(U) = ε for all U ∈U.
Let us put
mC(Z, d) := lim sup
ε→0
mC(Z, d, ε).
and m C(Z, d) := lim inf
ε→0 mC(Z, d, ε).

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Deﬁnition 3.13 The function mC(·, d)(m C(·, d)) is called upper (lower) capacitive
Carathéodory d-measure with respect to the structure (F, P, ξ, η, ψ).
The functions mC(·, d) and m C(·, d) for ﬁxed d satisfy properties similar to these
which are described in Proposition 3.35. It follows that the values
capCZ : = inf {d ∈P | mC(Z, d) = 0} and
cap
CZ : = inf {d ∈P | m C(Z, d) = 0}
are deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 3.14 The value capCZ(cap
CZ) is called upper (lower) Carathéodory
capacity of the set Z with respect to the structure (F, P, ξ, η, ψ).
Example 3.22 Let M be a compact metric space, F be the family of all open balls
in M, and P := [0, ∞). For an arbitrary Bε ∈F with ε > 0 and arbitrary d ∈P put
ξ(Bε, d) ≡η(Bε, d) := εd
and
ψ(Bε) ≡Φ(Bε) := ε .
It is clear that the structure (F, P, ξ, ψ, φ) so introduced satisﬁes the conditions
(A1)–(A5) and the upper Carathéodory capacity cap Z of a set Z ⊂M obtained in
this case coincides with the fractal dimension dimF Z, introduced in Sect.3.2.2.
Table 3.1 shows the dimension-like characteristics and their symbols.

3.4.2
Properties of the Carathéodory Dimension and
Carathéodory Capacity
The following result on the main properties of the Carathéodory
dimension is a
direct corollary of Proposition 3.35. The proof goes parallel to the proofs of similar
results for the Hausdorff dimension in Sect.3.2.1.
Proposition 3.37 Suppose that (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) is a Carathéodory structure on M
which satisﬁes (A1)–(A5). Then the following properties are true:
(1) dimC ∅= d∗;
(2) dimC Z1 ≤dimC Z2 for any Z1 ⊂Z2 ⊂M;
(3) dimC(
j≥1 Z j) = sup j≥1{dimC Z j} for any Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . .
Proposition 3.38 Suppose that (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) and (F′, P′, ξ ′, η′, ψ′) are two
Carathéodory
structures satisfying (A1)–(A5) on M and M′, respectively with
P = P′.
Suppose also that there exists a bijective map χ : M →M′ and a constant c > 0
such that for any U ∈F, U′ ∈F′, d ∈P
(1) χ−1(U′) ∈F, χ(U) ∈F′;
(2) c−1ξ ′(U′, d) ≤ξ

χ−1(U′), d

≤cξ ′(U′, d);
(3) c−1η′(U′, d) ≤η


≤cη′(U′, d);
(4) c−1ψ′(U′) ≤ψ

χ−1(U′)

≤cη′(U′).
Then for any Z′ ⊂M′ we have
dimC,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′ Z′ = dimC,F,ξ,η,ψ χ−1(Z′) ,
capC,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′Z′ = capC,F,ξ,η,ψχ−1 (Z′) ,
cap
C,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′Z′ = cap
C,F,ξ,η,ψχ−1(Z′) ,
where dimC,F,ξ,η,ψ, capC,F,ξ,η,ψ, and cap
C,F,ξ,η,ψ(dimC,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′ , cap
C,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′ , and
cap
C,F′,ξ′,η′,ψ′) denote the Carathéodory dimension, upper and lower Carathéodory
capacity of a set w.r.t. the structures (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) and (F′, P′, ξ ′, η′, ψ′) respec-
tively.
Proof Let us show the result for the Carathéodory dimension.
Suppose that Z′ ⊂M′ is a set and that G′ := {U′} is an arbitrary ε-cover of
Z′. It follows that G := {χ−1(U′) | U′ ∈G′} is a c ε-covering of χ−1(Z′) with
ψ(χ−1(U′)) ≤c ψ′(U) ≤c ε, ξ(χ−1(U′), d) ≤c ξ ′(U′, d). Furthermore we have

χ−1(U′)
ψ′(U′)≤ε
ξ(χ−1(U′), d) ≤c

χ−1(U′)
ψ′(U′)≤ε
ξ ′(U′, d) .
It follows that

ξ ′(U′, d) = c μc(Z′, d, ε).
This implies that for any d ∈P we have μc(χ−1(Z′), d) ≤cμc(Z′, d) and, conse-
quently, dimC,F,ξ,η,ψ(χ−1(Z′)) ≤dimC,F′,ξ ′,η′,ψ′(Z′). In the same way one shows
the opposite inequality.
□
The simplest properties of capacity are given by the next proposition.
Proposition 3.39 Suppose that (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) is a Carathéodory structure on M
satisfying (A1)–(A5). Then the following properties are true:
(1) capC∅= cap
C∅= d∗;
(2) dimC Z ≤cap
CZ ≤capCZ for any Z ⊂M;
(3) capCZ1 ≤capCZ2,
cap
CZ1 ≤cap

cap
C (
j≥1 Z j) ≥sup
j≥1
{cap

for
any
Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . .
We shall consider further some conditions, under which the inequality in state-
ment (4) of Proposition 3.39 turns out to be an equality.
Suppose also that in addition to conditions (A1)–(A5) the following condition is
satisﬁed:
(A6)
There exist two functions κ, Φ : F →R+ such that
ξ(U, d) = κ(U)Φ(U)d,
η(U, d) = Φ(U)d, ∀d ∈P, ∀U ∈F ,
(3.21)
and the equality
Φ(U1) = Φ(U2),
for U1, U2 ∈F is satisﬁed if ψ(U1) = ψ(U2) .
(3.22)
Using relation (3.22) we can deﬁne for ε > 0 the function
φ(ε) := Φ(U),
where U ∈F is an arbitrary set with ψ(U) = ε.
Let us put for arbitrary ε > 0 and Z ⊂M
Υ (Z, ε) := inf

U∈U
κ(U),
(3.23)
where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite or countable sets U of subsets from the
family F forming a covering of Z such that ψ(U) = ε, ∀U ∈U.

3.4 Dimension-Like Characteristics
141
For the function φ(ε) the following lemma is true.
Lemma 3.9 Under the above conditions we have
lim
ε→0 φ(ε) = 0 .
Proof Suppose the opposite. Then it can be found a number γ > 0 and a sequence
εm →0 such that
φ(εm) ≥γ
for all m ≥1.
By condition (A3) it can be found δ > 0 such that for any U ∈F, for which
ψ(U) ≤δ, the inequality Φ(U) ≤γ/2 is satisﬁed. Choose m to be so large that
εm ≤δ and take U ∈F such that ψ(U) = εm. Then φ(εm) ≤γ/2. Thus, we obtain
a contradiction.
□
The statement to be proved below generalizes the results of the previous section
on two equivalent deﬁnitions of fractal dimension.
Proposition 3.40 Suppose (F, P, ξ, η, ψ, κ, φ) is a Carathéodory structure for M
satisfying (A1)–(A6). Then for any Z ⊂M
capCZ = lim sup
ε→0
log Υ (Z, ε)
log

1/φ(ε)

and cap
CZ = lim inf
ε→0
log Υ (Z, ε)
log

1/φ(ε)
 .
Proof Put
d1 := capCZ,
d2 := lim sup
ε→0
log Υ (Z, ε)
log

1/φ(ε)
.
For a given γ > 0, choose a sequence εm →0 such that
∞= mC(Z, d1 −γ ) =
lim
m→+∞mC(Z, d1 −γ, εm).
Then mC(Z, d1 −γ, εm) ≥1 for all sufﬁciently large m. Therefore by (3.21)–(3.23)
for all sufﬁciently large m we obtain
φ(εm)d1−γ Υ (Z, εm) ≥1.
(3.24)
Passing, if necessary, to a subsequence, we can suppose that there exists a limit
lim
m→+∞
log Υ (Z, εm)
log

1/φ(εm)
 ≤d2.
(3.25)
According to (3.24)
d1 ≤γ + log Υ (Z, εm)
log

1/φ(εm)
.

142
3
Introduction to Dimension Theory
Passing to the limit as m →+∞and taking into account (3.25), we obtain
d1 ≤d2 + γ.
(3.26)
We now choose a sequence ε′
m →0 such
d2 = −lim
m→+∞
log Υ (Z, ε′
m)
log φ(ε′m)
.
(3.27)
Passing, if necessary, to a subsequence, we can suppose that
0 = mC(Z, d1 + γ ) =
lim
m→+∞mC(Z, d1 + γ, ε′
m).
Then mC(Z, d1 + γ, ε′
m) ≤1 for all sufﬁciently large m. Therefore by virtue of (3.27)
we have for all sufﬁciently large m
φ(ε′
m)d1+γ Υ (Z, ε′
m) ≤1.
It follows that d1 ≥−γ −log Υ (Z, ε′
m)/ log φ(ε′
m). Passing to the limit as m →
+∞and taking into account (3.27), we get
d1 ≥d2 −γ.
(3.28)
Since γ is an arbitrary number, it follows from (3.26) and (3.28) that d1 = d2. The
second statement is proved similarly.
□
Now we can reﬁne statement (4) of Proposition 3.39.
Proposition 3.41 Suppose (F, P, ξ, η, ψ, κ, φ) is a Carathéodory structure for M
satisfying (A1)–(A6). Let Z j ⊂M, j = 1, 2, . . . , k be arbitrary sets. Then
capC


In general it is not true that cap

.
Proof Let us show the ﬁrst assertion. Obviously, it is sufﬁcient to consider the case
k = 2. Suppose that Z = Z1 ∪Z2. Then from (3.23) for all ε > 0 we have
Υ (Z, ε) ≤Υ (Z1, ε) + Υ (Z2, ε).
(3.29)
By Proposition 3.39 there can be found the sequence εm →0 such that

3.4 Dimension-Like Characteristics
143
capCZ = −lim
m→+∞
log Υ (Z, εm)
log φ(εm)
.
Passing, if it is necessary, to a subsequence, we shall suppose that there exist the
limits
d j = −lim
m→+∞
log Υ (Z j, εm)
log φ(εm)
≤capCZ j,
j = 1, 2.
Put
am = log Υ (Z1, εm)
log

1/φ(εm)
 −log Υ (Z2, εm)
log

1/φ(εm)
 .
Whence it follows that
Υ (Z1, εm)
Υ (Z2, εm) = φ(εm)−am.
Therefore by (3.29) we get
log Υ (Z, εm) ≤log Υ (Z1, εm) + log

1 + φ(εm)am
.
(3.30)
Let us consider three cases.
Case 1: d1 > d2. There exists a > 0 such that am ≥a for all sufﬁciently large m.
Since log(1 + t) ≤t for t ≥t0, from (3.30) it follows that for such m we have
log Υ (Z, εm) ≤log Υ (Z1, εm) + φ(εm)am,
Therefore
log Υ (Z, εm)
log(1/φ(εm)) ≤log Υ (Z1, εm)
log(1/φ(εm)) −am
φ(εm)am
log(φ(εm)am).
Passing to the limit as m →+∞, taking into account Lemma3.9,
capCZ ≤d1 ≤max{capCZ1, capCZ2}.
(3.31)
Case 2: d1 = d2. Suppose that it can be found a number q such that φ(εm)am ≤q ≤1
for all sufﬁciently large m. Then since log(1 + t) ≤c log 1/t for all t ∈(0, q) with
a certain constant c > 0, we have
log

1 + φ(εm)am
≤cam log

1/φ(εm)

,
Therefore, using inequality (3.30) for log(1/φ(εm)) and passing to the limit as m →
+∞, we arrive at (3.31).
If such number q does not exist, then, passing to a subsequence, if it is neces-
sary, we may consider that φ(εm)am →1. By inequality (3.30) for log(1/φ(εm)) and
passing to the limit for m →+∞, we again obtain at (3.31).

144

Introduction to Dimension Theory
Case 3: d1 < d2. This case is analogous to case (1), but the values Υ (Z1, ε) and
Υ (Z2, ε) change over.
Thus, in all cases inequality (3.31) holds. Then the validity of the proposition
being proved follows from statement (4) of Proposition 3.39.

Abstract The ﬁrst part (Sects.4.2, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6) of the present chapter contains
several approaches to the investigation of the Fourier spectrum of almost periodic
solutions to various differential equations. The core element here is the Cartwright
theorem [6] that links the topological dimension of the orbit closure of an almost
periodic ﬂow and the algebraic dimension of its frequency module (Theorem 4.8).

(Theorem 4.11) originally presented in [7]. Applications of Cartwright’s theorems are
given for almost periodic ODEs based on the approach due to R. A. Smith (Theorem
4.12) and for DDEs based on results of Mallet-Paret from [16] (Theorem 4.14).
In Sect.4.7 we develop a method for studying fractal dimensions of forced almost
periodic oscillations using some kind of recurrence properties. This approach differs
from the one due to Douady and Oesterlé and highly relies on almost periodicity.
Some fundamental ideas ﬁrstly appeared in the works of Naito (see [17, 18]) and then
were developed in [1, 2]. In Sect.4.8 we study forced almost periodic oscillations in
Chua’s circuit and compare the analytical upper estimates of the fractal dimension
of their trajectory closures with numerical simulations given by the standard box-
counting algorithm.
4.1
Introduction
Almost periodic differential equations naturally appear in many ﬁelds of science
including physics, chemistry, biology and ecology. The simplest models describe
periodically or almost periodically forced oscillations in mechanics, behaviour of
chemical reactions under the inﬂuence of periodic or almost periodic perturbations
or population dynamics with time-dependent seasonal effects in ecology. A nice
list of references on quasi-periodicity phenomena discovered in applied problems is
given in [9].

Dimensional Aspects of Almost Periodic Dynamics
A possible way to study such systems is based on the method of small parameter
[14, 20]. On the other hand, nonlocal results can be derived with the use of topological
(see, for example, [3, 6, 7, 16, 26]) and operator (see [1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 17–19])
methods.
In this chapter we are mainly interested in dimension-like properties of almost
periodic solutions to various differential equations. Namely, those are the properties
established by Cartwright’s theorems and estimation of the fractal dimension of
almost trajectories closures.1 Unlike the former that has purely topological nature,
the latter problem (i.e. the study of fractal dimensions) is closely related to a method
proving the existence of almost periodic solutions. We present here an application
based on a method of Krasnosel’skii (Theorem 4.17 and [5, 14]). One more approach
which we do not discuss here is based on the method of strongly monotone operators
that often leads to the existence of a globally exponentially stable almost periodic
solution [15, 19, 29]. It can be applied to study variational inequalities [19] and
provides (under suitable conditions) all the required information about the solution:
its regularity and estimation of the Diophantine dimension (see Theorem 4.16, and
the discussion in [2]).
4.2
Topological Dimension of Compact Groups
In this section we give an introduction to topological groups theory (see [21]). We
omit most of the proofs and concentrate on the role of the Lebesgue covering dimen-
sion in the proof of Theorem 4.2, which will be used later to prove the Cartwright
theorem (Theorem 4.8). Note that many results in the case of our interest, i.e. for
compact and discrete groups, can be shown in a much easier manner.
Recall that the rank of an abelian group G is the maximal number of linearly
independent elements in G. It is denoted by rank G.
Remark 4.1 If the group is torsion-free then the rank is the minimum dimension
of Q-vector space in which the group G can be embedded. To see this suppose
x1, . . . , xk is a maximal linearly independent system in G. For each x ∈G the family
x, x1, . . . , xk is linearly dependent and we have ax = a1x1 + · · · + akxk with integer
coefﬁcients a, a1, . . . , ak and a ̸= 0. The map x →(a1/a, . . . , ak/a) from G to Qk
is well-deﬁned and realizes the required embedding.
Suppose that G is a topological group, i.e. there is a topology and a group structure
on G such that the operations of multiplication ((x, y) →xy) and the inverse (x →
x−1) are continuous maps. In the sequel we will deal only with abelian Hausdorff
topological groups. Simple examples such groups are given by the ﬂat torus Tm =
Rm/Zm and Rm. The character group (or dual group) G is deﬁned by the set of all
continuous homomorphisms from G to the circle group T∗= {z ∈C : |z| = 1}.
1That can be regarded as estimation of the fractal dimension of minimal sets consisting of almost
periodic orbits of skew-product ﬂows which is an extension of an almost periodic minimal ﬂow.

4.2 Topological Dimension of Compact Groups
151
There is a natural abelian group structure on G given by the pointwise product. Since
G is a subset in the space of all complex-valued continuous maps on G we endow
G with the compact-open topology. If G is locally compact then it can be shown
that G is also locally compact. For x ∈G consider the map αx : G →T∗deﬁned as
αx(χ) := χ(x) for χ ∈G. Clearly, αx is a character of G, i.e. αx ∈G. The following
fundamental fact is known as the Pontryagin duality.
Theorem 4.1 For every locally compact abelian group G the homomorphism x →
αx is a topological isomorphism2 between G and G.
Thedualgroup G isdiscreteprovidedthatGiscompactand G iscompactprovided
that G is discrete. This fact along with the Pontryagin duality allows us to express
topological properties of a compact group in purely algebraic terms of its discrete
character group.
For a closed subgroup H ⊂G we deﬁne the annihilator of H as the set Ann(H) :=
{χ ∈G | χ(x) = 1 ∀x ∈H}. Clearly, Ann(H) is a subgroup of G. In order to ﬁnd
the characters group of H or G/H one has the following facts:
(1) H ∼= G/ Ann(H);
(2) 
G/H ∼= Ann(H).
For our purposes we also need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1 Suppose G is discrete. Then for every neighborhood U of zero in G
with positive Lebesgue measure there exists a ﬁnitely generated group H ⊂G such
that Ann(H) ⊂U.
Suppose we have a continuous map f : M →N between two topological spaces.
We say that f reﬁnes the covering U of M if for every q ∈N the preimage f −1(q)
entirely lies in some element of U.
Lemma 4.2 Let M be a compact Hausdorff space. Let dimT M = n < ∞. Then
there exists a ﬁnite open cover U0 of M with the property that for arbitrary Hausdorff
space N and arbitrary continuous mapping f : M →N, if f reﬁnes the covering
U0 then it is necessary dimT N ≥n.
Proof Let U0 be an open cover of M such that any reﬁnement of it has order
≥n + 1. Suppose f reﬁnes U0. For any w ∈N we have w =  Vw, where the
intersection is taken over all open neighborhoods Vw of w. Let U ∈U0 be such that
f −1(w) ⊂U. Since f −1(w) = f −1  Vw

=  f −1 
Vw

⊂U we have a system
of closed subsets whose intersection lies in an open set. Due to compactness of
M for some Vw we have f −1(Vw) ⊂U. In particular, for every w ∈N there is an
open neighborhood Vw such that f −1(Vw) entirely lies in some element of A0. Let
V be a ﬁnite open cover of N by such neighborhoods Vw, w ∈N. Suppose that
2That is, the mentioned mapping is an isomorphism of groups and a homeomorphism of topological
spaces.

152

dimT N < n. Then there exists a reﬁnement, say V0, of V with order ≤n. Since
f −1(V) is a reﬁnement of U0 the same holds for f −1(V0). The order of V0 is not
lesser than the order of f −1(V0) that is ≥n + 1 by the particular choose of U0. This
is a contradiction.
□
Theorem 4.2 Let G be compact. We have
dimT G = rank G.
(4.1)
Proof For convenience, we put n := dimT G and r := rank G. By Theorem 4.1 we
may consider G as the character group of G.
(1) Lets show that n ≤r. Let U be a ﬁnite open cover of G (below we will
emphasize an additional property for U). For every x ∈G there exists an
open neighborhood of zero Vx such that x + 2Vx entirely lies in some ele-
ment from U. Let Vx1, . . . , Vxm be a ﬁnite cover of G by such sets and put
V := Vx1 ∩. . . ∩Vxm. Since G is discrete, by Lemma 4.1 there exists a ﬁnitely
generated subgroup X ⊂G with Ann(X) ⊂V. By the fundamental theorem of
ﬁnitely generated abelian groups X ∼= Zk ⊕F, where k ≤r and F is a ﬁnite
abelian group. Clearly, X ∼= (T∗)k ⊕F and since X ∼= G/ Ann(X) we have
dimT (G/ Ann(X)) = k ≤r. Now let U = U0 be an open cover given by Lemma
4.2. Since the natural projection π : G →G/ Ann(X) reﬁnes the covering U we
have n = dimT G ≤dimT (G/ Ann(X)) and, consequently, n ≤r.
(2) Consider an arbitrary k ≤r (or k < r if r = ∞) and suppose that S is a maximal
system of linearly independent elements in G. Then S contains at least k ele-
ments,sayχ1, . . . , χk.PutS′ = S\{χ1, . . . , χk}.LetXbethesubgroupofallele-
ments χ ∈G such that the family χ ∪S′ is linearly dependent. Clearly, the factor
G/X is torsion-free and [χ1], . . . , [χk] is a maximal linearly independent system
in G. Consider the annihilator Ann(X) as a subgroup of G. The group Ann(X)
is the character group of G/X. We will show that dimT Ann(X) ≥k that implies
dimT G ≥k. Consider the cube Qk = {x ∈Rk | |x j| ≤1/3, j = 1, . . . , k}. For
every x ∈Qk we deﬁne a character ξx of G/ Ann(X) as follows. For every
[χ] ∈G/ Ann(X) the family [χ], [χ1], . . . , [χk] is linearly dependent so we
have a[χ] = a1[χ1] + · · · + ak[χk] for some integers a, a1, . . . , ak with a ̸= 0.
Consider
ξx([χ]) := ei2π(
a1
a x1+···+ ak
a xk).
(4.2)
Clearly, ξx is a character (see Remark 4.1). Moreover, the map x →ξx deﬁnes a
homeomorphism between Qk and a subset of Ann(X). Therefore, dimT Ann(X) ≥k
that ﬁnishes the proof.

4.3
Frequency Module and Cartwright’s Theorem
on Almost Periodic Flows
Many presented facts of the theory of almost periodic functions may be found in [8,
15, 19]. The proof of Cartwright’s theorem (see [6]) based on the Pontryagin duality
was borrowed from [30].
Frequency Spectrum First of all, we will introduce the concept of the Fourier
spectrum for general almost periodic functions.
Let E be a Banach space (over R or C) with the norm ∥· ∥and let u : R →E be
a continuous function. For a given ε > 0 denote by Tε(u) the set of τ ∈R such that
∥u(· + τ) −u(·)∥∞≤ε, where ∥· ∥∞stands for the uniform norm. Such a number
τ is called an ε-almost period of u(·). Remind that a subset A ⊂R is relatively dense
if there is a number L > 0 such that the intersection A ∩[a, a + L] is not empty for
all a ∈R. The function u(·) is called E-almost periodic (or simply, almost periodic)
if the set Tε(u) is relatively dense for every ε > 0. From the deﬁnition it follows that
almost periodic functions are uniformly continuous and compact. It is clear that the
set of almost periodic functions is a closed subset of Cb(R; E).
The mean value of u(·) is the limit
M {u(·)} :=
lim
T→+∞

u(t)dt.
(4.3)
Its existence for almost periodic functions is known as the Bohr theorem. For ν ∈R
consider the Fourier transform of u(·):

(4.4)
It is known that U(ν) ̸= 0 for an at most countable set of ν’s, say {ν1, ν2, . . .}. Call
this set the spectrum of u and denote this set by Sp(u) and put Uk := U(νk). Then
there is a formal Fourier series of u(·):
u(t) ∼

(4.5)
ThesmallestadditivesubgroupofrealscontainingthesetSp(u)iscalledZ-module
and denoted by modZ(u). The linear subspace of R over Q spanned by Sp(u) is called
Q-module and denoted by modQ(u). The real numbers ω1, . . . , ωm are called rational
base for u(·) if for every νk ∈Sp(u), k = 1, 2, . . ., there is a unique representation

with r(k)
j
∈Q. If (4.6) holds with rk
j ∈Z then ω1, . . . , ωm are an integral base or
frequencies. In the latter case the function u(·) is called quasi-periodic. The unique-
ness of (4.6) is equivalent to linear independence of ω1, . . . , ωm over Q (rational
independence).
The following theorem is due to Bochner and gives a characterization of almost
periodic functions.
Theorem 4.3 A bounded continuous function u(·) is almost periodic if and only if
the set of its translates {u(· + s)}s∈R is relatively compact in the topology of uniform
convergence.
From Theorem 4.3 it is clear that a sum of two almost periodic functions is also
almost periodic.
Almost Periodic Flows Suppose we have a continuous ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R on a subset
M of a Banach space E such that ϕt(M) ⊂M for every t ∈R. For u0 ∈M the
motion t →ϕt(u0) is called almost periodic if the function u(t) := ϕt(u0) is E-
almost periodic. Let Mu be the closure of γ (u0) := {ϕt(u0) | t ∈R} = u(R) in E.
Theorem 4.4 The ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R can be uniquely extended from γ (u0) to Mu in such
a way that
(1) The set Mu is minimal and every motion t →ϕt(υ), υ ∈Mu, is almost periodic
with the same frequencies.
(2) The family {ϕt}t∈R is equicontinuous on Mu.
Proof (1) Since {ϕt} is continuous on γ (u0) for every ε > 0 and T > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that for υ1, υ2 ∈γ (u0) we have
∥ϕt(υ1) −ϕt(υ2)∥≤ε, 0 ≤t ≤T,
provided that ∥υ1 −υ2∥< δ. Let L > 0 be a number such that Tε(u) ∩[a, a + L]
is non-empty for every a ∈R and take T > L. Then for every t there is an ε-almost
period τ such that t = τ + r, 0 ≤r ≤L. Hence, for t ∈R we have
∥ϕt(υ1) −ϕt(υ2)∥≤∥ϕt(υ1) −ϕr(υ1)∥+ ∥ϕr(υ1) −ϕr(υ2)∥
+ ∥ϕr(υ2) −ϕt(υ2)∥≤3ε.
(4.7)
So the ﬂow {ϕt} is equicontinuous on γ (u0).
(2) Now suppose that um = u(tm) = ϕtm(u0) →υ ∈Mu for some sequence tm,
m = 1, 2 . . .. We have from (1) that for ε > 0 there is M = M(ε) such that
∥ϕt(um) −ϕt(um+p)∥< ε, p = 1, 2, . . .
(4.8)
provided that m > M. In other words, the deﬁnition ϕt(υ) := limm→+∞ϕt(um) is
correct and the limit exists uniformly in t ∈R. The motion t →ϕt(υ) =: υ(t) is
almost periodic. Indeed, for τ ∈Tε(u) we have

4.3 Frequency Module and Cartwright’s Theorem on Almost Periodic Flows
155
∥υ(t + τ) −υ(t)∥≤∥υ(t + τ) −ϕt+τ(um)∥+ ∥ϕt+τ(um) −ϕt(um)∥
+ ∥ϕt(um) −υ(t)∥≤3ε.
(4.9)
Now the minimality of Mu is obvious. The equicontinuity of {ϕt} on Mu follows
from (1) and (2). Since we have
u(t + tm) ∼
∞
	
k=1
Ukeiνktmeiνkt,
(4.10)
it follows that Sp(υ) = Sp(u). Thus, the theorem is proved.
□
Remark 4.2 Further, for an almost periodic function u(·) we will study some
dimensional-like properties of the set Mu := Cl(u(R)). In the case u(·) is an almost
periodic motion of a ﬂow we say that Mu is the closure of an almost periodic orbit,
otherwise (i.e. when the curve given by u(·) has self-intersections) we refer to Mu
as the closure of an almost periodic trajectory.
Now we deﬁne a group structure on Mu. For υ1, υ2 ∈Mu such that ϕtn(u0) →υ1
and ϕsn(u0) →υ2 we put
υ1
u0+ υ2 := lim
n→∞ϕtn+sn(u0).
(4.11)
Theorem 4.5 The above deﬁnition of
u0+ is correct and (Mu,
u0+) is a compact con-
nected abelian group.
Proof The family {ϕt}t∈R is equicontinuous on γ (u0) and, therefore, the uniformly
continuous on a dense subset γ (u0) × γ (u0) function
u0+ can be uniquely extended to
a continuous function on Mu × Mu in the way we did in (4.11). Now it is clear from
(4.11) that the operation
u0+ is associative, commutative and u0 is the zero element. If
ϕtn(u0) →υ then, by Theorem 4.3, tn can be chosen such that the sequence ϕ−tn(u0)
isalsoconvergentanditslimit
u0−υ istheinverseofυ,i.e.υ
u0+ (
u0−υ) = u0.Topological
properties of Mu are obvious.
□
The Cartwright Theorem Now our purpose is to show that for every almost periodic
function there is a corresponding almost periodic ﬂow. Consider the hull H(u) of an
E-almost periodic function u(·) deﬁned by the set Cl{u(· + s) | s ∈R}, where the
closure is taken in the uniform topology of the space Cb(R; E). By Theorem 4.3, the
set H(u) is compact. The family of shift operators ϑs : Cb(R; E) →Cb(R; E), where
s ∈R and ϑs(υ) := υ(· + s) for υ ∈Cb(R; E), restricted to H(u) deﬁnes an almost
periodic ﬂow ({ϑs}s∈R, H(u)) for which the set H(u) is minimal, i.e. H(u) = H(υ)
for every υ ∈H(u). In particular, the function U(t) := ϑt(u) is Cb(R; E)-almost
periodic. The following proposition can be shown by straightforward calculations,
which we omit here.

Proposition 4.1 For U(·) we have
U(t) ∼
∞
	
k=1
Ukeiνkt,
(4.12)
where Uk(s) = eiνksUk with Uk and νk from (4.5). In particular, Sp(U) = Sp(u).
As it was shown before there is a group structure on H(u) given by the operation
u+. The following theorem shows that if u(·) is given by an almost periodic motion
then the group structures on Mu and H(u) are topologically isomorphic.
Theorem 4.6 Suppose the motion t →ϕt(u0) is almost periodic and u(t) :=
ϕt(u0); then the groups (Mu,
u0+) and (H(u),
u+) are topologically isomorphic.
Proof We deﬁne a map i : H(u) →Mu as follows. Put i(ϑt(u)) := ϕt(u0) for every
t ∈R and then extend it by continuity. Note that if ϑtn(u) →υ in Cb(R; E) then
ϕtn(u0) →υ(0) in E. Thus,i(υ) = υ(0) for any υ ∈H(u) andi(ϑt(υ)) = ϕt(υ(0)).
In particular, i is continuous. In order to show the injectivity of i note that i(υ) =
u0 implies υ(0) = u0 and, consequently, υ ≡u. If ϕtn(u0) →υ0 ∈Mu then the
Bochner theorem guarantees there is a subsequence {t′
n} ⊂{tn} such that ϑt′
n(u)
converges uniformly to some υ ∈H(u). It is obvious that i(υ) = υ0 and this shows
the surjectivity of i. Finally, the map i is a continuous bijective map between compact
metric spaces and, therefore, is a homeomorphism.

Theorem 4.7 For any E-almost periodic function u(·) we have3

H(u) ∼= modZ(u).
(4.13)
Proof Suppose u(·) has the Fourier series as in (4.5). Then for any υ ∈H(u) we have
that υ(t) ∼
∞
k=1 Ukeiθk(υ)eiνkt, where θk(υ) is deﬁned modulo 2π. Deﬁne χk(υ) :=
eiθk(υ). From (4.11) it is clear that χ(υ1
u+ υ2) = χ(υ1)χ(υ2). The homomorphism
χk(υ) is continuous and, therefore, is a character of H(u). For any ﬁnite set of
integers a1, . . . , am the homomorphism χa1
1 · . . . · χam
m is also a character. It turns out
that there is no other characters (for a proof see [30]). Any character χ(·) satisﬁes
χ(ϑt(u)) = eiθt with θ =

k=1 akνk for some integers a1, . . . , am. The map χ →θ
deﬁnes a group isomorphism.
□
Now the Cartwright theorem can be formulated as follows.
3Here by 
H(u) ∼= modZ(u) we mean a group isomorphism. In general, it is not a homeomorphism
since the character group 
H(u) is discrete and modZ(u) can be a dense subgroup of R.

4.3 Frequency Module and Cartwright’s Theorem on Almost Periodic Flows
157
Theorem 4.8 For any E-almost periodic function u(·) we have
dimT H(u) = dim modQ(u).
(4.14)
In particular, if u(t) = ϕt(u0), where t →ϕt(u0) is an almost periodic motion, then
dimT Mu = dim modQ(u).
Proof From Theorem 4.2 we have
dimT H(u) = rank 
H(u).
(4.15)
By Theorem 4.7 and since modQ(u) is the least Q-vector space containing modZ(u)
it follows (see Remark 4.1) that rank 
H(u) = dim modQ(u). The second part of the
theorem directly follows from Theorem 4.6.

4.4
Minimal Sets in Euclidean Spaces
In this subsection we shall prove Hilmy’s theorem (see [11]) on the estimation
of the topological dimension for a minimal set Mmin of a dynamical system
({ϕt}t∈R, M, ρ) on the open subset M ⊂Rn with the Euclidean distance ρ and
with a group as time set, i.e. T ∈{R, Z}.
Theorem 4.9 Suppose Mmin ⊂M is a compact minimal set of ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ).
Then dimT Mmin ≤n −1.
For the proof of Theorem 4.9 we need two lemmas.
Lemma 4.3 Let S ⊂M be an invariant set of ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ). If the boundary ∂S
is non-empty then ∂S is also invariant.
Proof Suppose that ∂S ̸= ∅and u0 ∈∂S. Consider an arbitrary t ∈T and an arbi-
trary ε > 0. By the continuity of the dynamical system w.r.t. the map u0 →ϕt(u0)
it is possible to ﬁnd a number δ > 0 such that Bδ(u0) ⊂M and
ϕt(Bδ(u0)) ⊂Bε(ϕt(u0)),
where Bδ(u0) (resp. Bε(ϕt(u0))) denotes the ball of radius δ (resp. ε) and centrum
at u0 (resp. ϕt(u0)). Since Bδ(u0) contains points of S as well as points of M\S,
it follows that ϕt(Bδ(u0)) and, consequently, Bε(ϕt(u0)), posses the same property.
But ε was an arbitrary positive number. Therefore, ϕt(u0) ∈∂S.
□
Lemma 4.4 If Mmin is a minimal set of ({ϕt}t∈T, M, ρ) then all points of Mmin
are either boundary points or all are inner points.

158

Dimensional Aspects of Almost Periodic Dynamics
Proof Suppose to the contrary that Mmin contains boundary points as well as inner
points. Since Mmin is closed, we have ∂Mmin ⊂Mmin. From Lemma 4.3 it follows
that ∂Mmin is an invariant set. This shows that ∂Mmin is a proper subset of Mmin
which is also invariant. But this contradicts the fact that Mmin is minimal.
□
Proof of Theorem 4.9 Suppose that dimT Mmin = n. Then by Proposition 3.8,
Chap.3, the set Mmin must contain inner points. But according to Lemma 4.4 this is
impossible, since from the compactness of Mmin it follows that ∂Mmin ̸= ∅.
□
Suppose that ({ϕt}t∈R, Mu) is an almost periodic ﬂow deﬁned on the closure
Mu ⊂Rn of an almost periodic motion t →ϕt(u0) = u(t). Recall that its frequen-
cies is the Fourier exponents Sp(u) of u(·). Since the set Mu is minimal, Theorems
4.8 and 4.9 guarantee that dimT Mu = dim modQ(u) ≤n −1, i.e. the frequencies
of the ﬂow have a rational base with no more that n −1 terms. We omit a proof of
the following theorem that is a mix of results of Cartwright and Kodaira and Abe
(see [6]).
Theorem 4.10 If dimT Mu = n −1 then (Mu,
u0+) is isomorphic to the (n −1)-
dimensional torus group and the frequencies of the ﬂow have an integral base with
n −1 terms.
The second part of Theorem 4.10 says that almost periodic ﬂows in Rn having the
highest possible dimension (i.e. n −1) are quasi-periodic.

Almost Periodic Solutions of Almost Periodic ODEs
Structure of the Frequency Spectrum In what follows we will deal with the fol-
lowing ODE in Rn
˙u = f (t, u),
(4.16)
where f (t, u) is continuous. We also assume that
(A1) f (t, u) is almost periodic in t uniformly in u from compact subsets of Rn.
(A2) The solutions to (4.16) are unique.
Remark 4.3 Condition (A1) means that f is almost periodic as a function t →
f (t, ·) ∈C(K; Rn) for every compact K ⊂Rn. We say that the corresponding
ε-almost periods are the ε-almost periods of
f (·, u) uniformly in u ∈K. Since
C(K; Rn) is a Banach space, we have all the introduced Fourier theory for such
functions, namely, one can write

where Fk(·), k = 1, 2, . . ., are continuous functions that is not identically zero on Rn.
Thus, we can consider the Z-module modZ( f ) of f generated by all the exponents
from (4.17).
The following lemma is due to E. Kamke (see Theorem 3.2 in [10]).
Lemma 4.5 Let G ⊂Rn be an open subset and consider a sequence gk ∈C(R ×
G; Rn), k = 1, 2, . . .. Let uk(·) be a maximal solution to ˙u = gk(t, u). Suppose that
gk converges to g in the compact-open topology and uk(0) converges to some u0 ∈G;
then
(A) there is a subsequence of uk(·) converging to a solution u(·) of ˙u = g(t, u) with
u(0) = u0. The convergence is uniform on the compact intervals on which u
exists.
(B) If the solution to ˙u = g(t, u) with u(0) = u0 is unique then the entire sequence
uk(·) converges to u(·).
Condition (A2) is essential for the following lemma which will be used in the
future.
Lemma 4.6 Suppose (A1)–(A2) hold and u is an almost periodic solution to (4.16).
Let the sequence tm, m = 1, 2, . . ., be such that (ϑtm( f ))(t, υ) = f (t + tm, υ) →
f (t, υ) uniformly in (t, υ) ∈R × M(u), where M(u) = Cl(u(R)). If u(tm) con-
verges to some ˜υ0 then u(· + tm) converges to the solution ˜υ of (4.16) with ˜υ(0) = ˜υ0
which is almost periodic.
Proof By Lemma 4.5 we get the convergence of u(· + tm) to ˜υ(·) on compact subsets
in the interval of its existence. Since u(·) is bounded we deduce that ˜υ is deﬁned on
the whole real axis and, consequently, the convergence of u(· + tm) is uniform and
˜υ is almost periodic.

It may happen that an almost periodic solution, say u, to (4.16) may have the
Fourier exponents (frequencies) that do not belong to the Q-module of f . We call
these frequencies additional. For example, if f is independent of t then any fre-
quency of u is additional. In the latter case we know from Theorems 4.8 and 4.9
that dim modQ(u) ≤n −1. It turns out that a similar fact holds within the non-
autonomous situation. Namely, the dimension of the subspace generated by addi-
tional frequencies is always bounded from above by n −1. This is also a result of
M. L. Cartwright (see [7]) and can be formulated as follows.
Theorem 4.11 Suppose (A1)–(A2) hold and u is an almost periodic solution to
(4.16). Denote the set of additional exponents by SpC(u). If SpC(u) is not empty
then there exists an almost periodic ﬂow {ϕt
0} deﬁned on the set A0 ⊂Rn consisting
of initial conditions υ0 such that the solution υ(t) = υ(t, 0, υ0) to (4.16) is almost
periodic. Moreover, the Q-module of this ﬂow is the subspace generated by SpC(u).
In particular,
dim modQ(u, f )
modQ( f )
= dim span(SpC(u)) ≤n −1.

Dimensional Aspects of Almost Periodic Dynamics
Remark 4.4 The ﬁrst assertion of Theorem 4.11 (i.e. the existence of an almost
periodic ﬂow) can be proved for cocycles in a Banach space for which the driving
system is an almost periodic minimal ﬂow. The ideas of the proof is almost identical
to the ones presented below. Then some reduction principle as in Theorem 4.12 can
be used to show a similar inequality as in (4.18).
In order to prove Theorem 4.11 we need to establish some auxiliary facts. Firstly,

i.e. we put ν∗

νk is linearly independent with ν1 and by induction we deﬁne ν∗
l as ν∗
k0 where k0
is the smallest number k such that νk is linearly independent with ν∗
1, . . . , ν∗
l−1. By
similar procedure we choose a subset {ν j} ⊂Sp(u) which complements the set {ν∗
l }
to a basis of modQ(u, f ). Then any exponent of u can be uniquely represented as

to (4.16) is almost periodic and υ(t) = Φ(t, θ1 + t, θ2 + t, . . .).

not exclude the case when this number may be inﬁnite.

Proof To get the uniformity in (4.22) choose 0 < ε1, ε2 ≤ε and consider the cor-
responding functions Φε1 and Φε2. Fix t ∈R and θ1, . . . , θM+ ∈R, where M+ =

To get (2) put ˜υ(t) := Φ(t, θ1 + t, θ2 + t, . . .). It is clear that ˜υ is almost peri-
odic as the uniform limit of the functions Φε(t, θ1 + t, . . . , θM(ε) + t) which are
trigonometric polynomials for ﬁxed θ1, θ2, . . .. As above we can ﬁnd a sequence {tm}

that shows u(· + tm) →˜υ(·) uniformly. Moreover, from the arithmetic nature of
almost periods, the sequence {tm} can be chosen such that (ϑtm( f ))(t, υ) = f (t +
tm, υ) →f (t, υ) uniformly in (t, υ) ∈R × Mu. Therefore, we are in the situation
of Lemma 4.6 and ˜υ ≡υ(t).
□
Now consider the set A0 := {Φ(0, t, t, . . .) | t ∈R}. For p = Φ(0, s, s, . . .) ∈
A0 we put ϕt
0(p) := Φ(0, t + s, t + s, . . .). The following proposition shows the
correctness of such a deﬁnition and, as a consequence, {ϕt
0} is an almost periodic
ﬂow on A0.
Proposition 4.3 Suppose for some t1, t2 ∈R we have the identity Φ(0, t1, t1, . . .)
= Φ(0, t2, t2, . . .). Then either t1 = t2 or span SpC(u) = span{ν1} and t1 −t2 = 0
(mod 2π Q/ν1) for some integer Q. Moreover, in the latter case the ﬂow {ϕt
0} is
2π Q/ν1-periodic.
Proof Since we have, by Proposition 4.2, υ1(t) := Φ(t, t1 + t, t1 + t, . . .) and
υ2(t) := Φ(t, t2 + t, t2 + t, . . .) are almost periodic solutions to (4.16) from
υ1(0) = υ2(0) and (A2) we get that υ1 ≡υ2. Considering the Fourier expansions of
υ1 and υ2 we get

(4.27)
where Uk is the Fourier coefﬁcient of u corresponding to νk from (4.19). In virtue
the choice of {ν j} for every j there exists k such that (4.27) takes the form
ν j(t1 −t2) = 0
(mod 2π).
(4.28)
If there are more than one of such j’s then from (4.28) it follows that t1 = t2. Oth-
erwise ν1 forms a basis for the set of additional exponents and
r1,kν1(t1 −t2) = 0
(mod 2π), k = 1, 2, . . . .
(4.29)
It is easy to see that (4.29) is satisﬁed if t1 −t2 = 2π Q/ν1 for a proper integer Q.
For such a choice of t1 and t2 in virtue of the uniqueness of Fourier expansions we
have Φ(t, t1 + t, t1 + t, . . .) = Φ(t, t2 + t, t2 + t, . . .). So the ﬂow {ϕt
0} is 2π Q/ν1-
periodic.
□
Now we can ﬁnish the proof.
Proof of Theorem 4.11 We have deﬁned the ﬂow {ϕt
0} on the set A0 consisting of
initial conditions of almost periodic solutions to (4.16). For p = Φ(0, 0, 0, . . .) ∈A0
the function υ(t) = ϕt
0(p) = Φ(0, t, t, . . .) is almost periodic and it has the Fourier
expansion

By Theorem 4.4 the ﬂow {ϕt
0} can be extended to a minimal almost periodic ﬂow
on the compact set Mυ and from Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 we get dim span(C(u)) =
dimT Mυ ≤n −1.

Sharper Estimates under the Squeezing Property. Results in this paragraph are
based on ideas of Smith ([26], see also [3]).
Let S ⊂Rn be some subset and consider for system (4.16) the following condi-
tions
(A3) There exist constants κ > 0, ε > 0 and a constant real symmetric matrix P
such that for all t ∈R and all u1, u2 ∈S
(P[ f (t, u1) −f (t, u2) + κ(u1 −u2)], u1 −u2) ≤−ε|u1 −u2|2;
(4.31)
(A4) P has j negative eigenvalues and n −j positive eigenvalues;
If V (u) := (Pu, u) and u(·), υ(·) are solutions of (4.16), (A3) gives

≤−2ε|u(t) −υ(t)|2e2κt, for all t such that u(t), υ(t) ∈S.
(4.32)
Remark 4.5 Inequality (4.32) is often called squeezing property. In inertial man-
ifold theory the eigenvalue properties of P in (A4) are connected with the gap
condition [23].
If κ ≥0 is the constant in (A3) then a solution u(·) of (4.16) is said to be amenable
in (−∞; τ], for some τ ∈R, if u(t) ∈S for −∞< t ≤τ and
 τ

+∞. For each τ let Aτ denote the subset of S consisting of points u(τ) taken over
all solution u(·) of (4.16) which are amenable in (−∞; τ]. Then Aτ is called an
amenable set of (4.16) in S.
Lemma 4.7 Let u and υ be two amenable in (−∞; τ] solutions of (4.16); then
V (u(t) −υ(t)) ≤0 for every t ∈(−∞, τ].
Proof Integrating inequality (4.32) on [r, t], r ≤t ≤τ, we get

e2κsk|u(sk) −υ(sk)|2 →0 as k →∞. Putting r = sk in (4.33) and taking it to the
limit as k →∞we get that V (u(t) −υ(t)) ≤0.

If P satisﬁes(A3)thereexistsaninvertiblerealn × n matrix Q suchthat Q∗P Q =
diag(−I j, In−j), where Ir denotes the unit r × r-matrix. The quadratic form V (u) =
(Pu, u) is therefore reduced to the canonical form V (u) = |η|2 −|ζ|2 by the linear
substitution x = Q(ζ, η)T in which ζ ∈R j and η ∈Rn−j. Let Π : Rn →R j be the
linear map deﬁned by Πu := ζ for all u ∈Rn. Since |Q−1u| = |ζ|2 + |η|2 we have
V (u) + 2|Πu|2 = |Q−1u|2 ≥|Πu|2, ∀u ∈Rn.
(4.34)
Consider two arbitrary amenable in (−∞; τ] solutions u and υ of (4.16). Under
the assumption that (A3) and (A4) are satisﬁed from Lemma 4.7 it follows that
V (u(t) −υ(t)) ≤0, t ≤τ, and (4.34) implies that
2|Π(u(τ) −υ(τ))|2 ≥|Q−1(u(τ) −υ(τ))|2 ≥|Π(u(τ) −υ(τ))|2.
(4.35)
Thus, for any p1, p2 ∈Aτ we have
2|Πp1 −Πp2|2 ≥|Q−1(p1 −p2)|2 ≥|Πp1 −Πp2|2.
(4.36)
This shows, that the restricted mapping Π : Aτ →ΠAτ gives a homeomorphism of
Aτ onto the subset ΠAτ of R j.
Theorem 4.12 Suppose that (4.16) satisﬁes (A1)–(A4). If u is an almost periodic
solution to (4.16) such that Mu ⊂S then
dim modQ(u, f )
modQ( f )
= dim span(SpC(u)) ≤j −1.
(4.37)
Proof Since κ > 0 any bounded on the entire line solution which lies in S is
amenable and, in particular, so is u. From Theorem 4.11 we get the ﬂow ϕt
0
on the set A0 ⊂Mu ⊂S which consists of initial conditions corresponding to
almost periodic solutions of (4.16). In particular, A0 ⊃A0. Since by (4.36) the
map Π : A0 →ΠA0 ⊂R j is a homeomorphism it takes the ﬂow {ϕt
0} to the
ﬂow {ψt
0} on the set B0 := ΠA0 deﬁned by ψt
0(w) := (Π ◦ϕt
0 ◦Π−1)(w) for all
w ∈B0 and t ∈R. Let z = Πw. Note that ζ(t) := ψt
0(z) is almost periodic and
modZ(ζ) = modZ(υ), where υ(t) = ϕt
0(w). In particular the dimensions of the Q-
modules of the ﬂows coincide. From this and Theorems 4.8 and 4.9 we establish that
dim modQ(υ) = dim modQ(ζ) ≤j −1 that is (4.37).

Rr →R such that
F(υ, 0) ≥0, ∀υ ∈Rs,
(4.39)
F(υ1 −υ2, φ(t, υ1) −φ(t, υ2)) ≥0, ∀t ∈R, ∀υ1, υ2 ∈Rs.
(4.40)
Denote by FC the Hermitian extension of F onto Cs × Cr.
Theorem 4.13 Suppose that there exists parameters κ > 0 and δ > 0 such that the
following conditions hold:
(1) The pair (A + κ I, B) is stabilizable;
(2) The matrix A + κ I has j ≥1 eigenvalues with positive real part and n −j
eigenvalues with negative real part;
(3) FC(Cυ, ξ) ≤−δ(|υ|2 + |ξ|2), ∀υ ∈Cn, ∀ξ ∈Cr, ∀ω ∈R such that iωυ =
(A + κ I)υ + Bξ.
Then (A1)–(A4) holds for (4.38) with S = Rn. In particular, any almost periodic
solution u(·) of (4.38) satisfy (4.37).
Proof Since (A + κ I, B) is stabilizable and the frequency-domain condition (3) is
satisﬁed, we conclude from the Yakubovich-Kalman frequency theorem (Theorem
2.7, Chap.2) that there exists a real n × n matrix P = P∗and δ > 0 such that for all
u ∈Rn, ξ ∈Rr
2 (u, P[(A + κ I)u + Bξ]) + F(Cu, ξ) ≤−δ

|u|2 + |ξ|2
.
(4.41)
If we put in (4.41) ξ = 0 we get, using (4.39), the inequality
2 (u, P(A + κ I)u) ≤−δ|u|2, ∀u ∈Rn.
(4.42)
It follows from Lemma 2.8, Chap.2 and the assumption (2) of the theorem that the
matrix P has exactly j negative and (n −j) positive eigenvalues. Consider (4.41)
with u = u1 −u2 and ξ = φ(t, Cu1) −φ(t, Cu2), where u1, u2 ∈Rn are arbitrary.
It follows that
2 (u1 −u2, P[A(u1 −u2) + B(φ(t, u1) −φ(t, u2)) + κ(u1 −u2)])
+F(Cu1 −Cu2, φ(t, Cu1) −φ(t, Cu2)) ≤−δ|u1 −u2|2.
(4.43)
From the assumption (3) we have
F(Cu1 −Cu2, φ(t, Cu1) −φ(t, Cu2)) ≥0.
(4.44)
This and (4.43) imply that for f (t, u) := Au + Bφ(t, Cu) + g(t) the hypothesis
(A3) is satisﬁed. Thus Theorem 4.12 is applicable.

Frequency Spectrum of Almost Periodic Solutions
for DDEs
The main results of this section are due to Mallet-Paret [16].
In what follows we study the Fourier spectrum of almost periodic solutions to the
following delay differential equation
˙u(t) = f (u(t), u(t −h1), . . . , u(t −hN)),
(4.45)
where u ∈Rn and f : Rn(N+1) →Rn is continuously differentiable function with
bounded on Rn(N+1) derivative; h j ∈(0, 1] are constants. We choose as our phase
space the Hilbert space
H = L2([−1, 0], Rn) × Rn.
We write (ψ(·), ψ(0)) for the elements of H. Then the norm is given by
∥(ψ(·), ψ(0))∥2 =
 0
−1
|ψ2(s)|ds + |ψ(0)|2.
Given (ψ, ψ(0)) ∈H we consider (4.45) along with the initial value problem
u0(s) = u(s) = ψ(s), −1 ≤s < 0,
u(0) = ψ(0).
(4.46)
Standard techniques show that the initial value problem (4.45), (4.46) has a unique
solution u(·) deﬁned on [0, +∞). So we obtain a semiﬂow {ϕt}t≥0 on H such that
ϕt(ψ(·), ψ(0)) := (u(· + t)

[−1,0], u(t)), t ≥0.
(4.47)
Put ϕ := ϕ1 : H →H. We omit the proof that ϕ is compact (i.e. it takes bounded
sets into the sets of compact closure) and has a continuous Fréchet derivative. For
b > 0 consider the set
Γb :={(ψ(·), ψ(0)) ∈H | the problem (4.45), (4.46) has a solution u(t),
t ≤0, such that |u(t)| ≤b for t ≤0}.
Suppose u(·) is an almost periodic solution to (4.45). It is clear that each υ(·) ∈H(u)
is also an almost periodic solution to (4.45). Put b := supt∈R |u(t)|. The map υ →
(υ

[−1,0], υ(0)) maps H(u) into Γb continuously. If υ1

[−1,0] = υ2

[−1,0] then, since
the solution to (4.45), (4.46) is unique, υ1(t) = υ2(t) for t ≥0. It follows that the
Fouries series of υ1(·) and υ2(·) coincide and, therefore, υ1 ≡υ2. Hence, H(u) is
homeomorphic to a subset of Γb and, in particular, dimT H(u) ≤dimT Γb. Thus, by
Theorem 4.8, the algebraic dimension of the frequency module modQ(u) is majorized
by the topological dimension of Γb. We will show the following

4.6 Frequency Spectrum of Almost Periodic Solutions for DDEs
167
Theorem 4.14 The set Γb has ﬁnite topological dimension for each b > 0. In par-
ticular, every almost periodic solution to (4.45) has a ﬁnite rational frequency base.
In order to prove Theorem 4.14 we need to establish some properties of compact
operators and their negatively invariant sets. In the further text H denotes a separable
Hilbert space.
The set Γb deﬁned above is compact and negatively invariant (i.e. ϕ(Γb) ⊃Γb).
This is due to the following
Proposition 4.4 Suppose ϕ : U →H is continuous and we have V ⊂U ⊂H with
U open and V closed. Let ϕ(V) have a compact closure. Then the set
Γ := {x0 ∈V | ∃{xk}∞
k=1 ⊂V : ϕ(xk) = xk−1}
is compact and negatively invariant.
Proof It is clear that ϕ(Γ ) ⊃Γ . To prove Γ is compact assume that there is
a sequence {x(m)
0
}∞
m=1 ⊂Γ . For every m there is a sequence {x(m)
k
}∞
k=1 ⊂V with
ϕ(x(m)
k
) = x(m)
k−1, k ≥1. Consider the following diagram

Since each point lies in ϕ(V) by using diagonal procedure we can assume that the
sequence in k-th vertical section converges as m →∞to some x∗
k ∈V. From the

Proposition 4.5 Suppose U ⊂H is an open set and ϕ : U →H has a continuous
Fréchet derivative. If the closure cl (ϕ(U)) is compact then for every x ∈U the

there is a weakly convergent sequence ym such that Dϕ(x)ym does not converge
strongly. We may assume that ym ⇀0, ∥ym∥= 1 and ∥Dϕ(x)ym∥≥ε for some

Then the topological dimension of Γ is ﬁnite.
Before giving a proof, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.9 SupposeZ ⊂Rn hasdiameterη < ∞andlet p > 0 beaninteger.Then
there exists a partition of Z into not more than pn sets, with each set of diameter at
most 2ηn1/2 p−1.
Proof Enclose Z in a ball of diameter 2η, and the ball in a cube of edge 2η. Partition
the cube into pn subcubes Ki, each of edge 2ηp−1, and, therefore, having diameter
2ηn1/2 p−1. Clearly, the sets Ki ∩Z form the required partition.

Proof of Theorem 4.15 We will show that there exist constants α, β ∈(0, 1),
δ0 > 0 and N > 0 such that for given sets {Si} with

By appropriate choosing of Si we can make the sum 
i diam(Si)N arbitrarily close
to μH(Γ, N, δ). So we obtain
μH(Γ, N, αδ) ≤βμH(Γ, N, δ), for δ ≤δ0.
(4.53)
Iterating (4.53) we get
μH(Γ, N, αmδ) ≤βmμH(Γ, N, δ), for m = 1, 2, . . . ,
(4.54)
which implies that μH(γ, N) = 0 since for compact sets any pre-measure is ﬁnite.
Therefore by Proposition 3.20, Chap.3, dimT Γ ≤dimH Γ < ∞. Now we are going
to show the existence of α, β, δ0 and N, and construct Qi j’s.
Since Γ is compact there are constants K > 0, a ∈(0, 1) and an open neighbor-
hood (without less of generality U) of Γ such that

Let δ0 > 0 be the distance between Γ and H\U. Suppose Si and δ are as in (4.51).
Let F be the orthogonal complement of E and set n := dim F. Since H is a Hilbert

Denote the convex hull of Si by conv(Si). Clearly,
diam(Si) = diam(conv(Si)) ≤δ < δ0,
so that Si ⊂conv(Si) ⊂U. Now we will estimate diam(Qi j) to show (4.52). For
u ∈H we write u = (υ, w), where υ ∈E, w ∈F. By deﬁnition, for u1, u2 ∈Pi j the
points T (u1) and T (u2) are arbitrary points in Qi j. We have immediately
∥υ1 −υ2∥≤diam(πE(Si)) = ξi,
∥w1 −w2∥≤diam(πF(Pi j)) = diam(Zi j) ≤2ηin1/2 p−1

Ub := {(ψ(·), ψ(0)) ∈H | ∥ψ, ψ(0)∥2 < 3b2}.
Clearly, Ub is open and V is closed. Thus, the trio Γb ⊂V ⊂U along with the operator

Fractal Dimensions of Almost Periodic Trajectories
and The Liouville Phenomenon
Investigating fractal dimensions of the closures of quasi-periodic trajectories we
face the following obstacle. Since a quasi-periodic function u(·) is the restriction of
a periodic function of several, say m, variables to a dense winding on the torus, i.e.
u(t) = Φu(ωt), ω ∈Rm, the dimensional properties of its closure Mu = Φu(Tm)
depends on how Φu affects the diameters of sets, i.e. on the Hölder-like properties.
But it seems impossible to get some regularity results for Φu in the case of nonlinear
equations since the original differential equation determines the behaviour of Φu only
in the direction of the winding ωt on Tm and do not restrict it in transversal directions.
It appears that this problem can be avoided if we have additional information about
u(·), for example, if u(·) is a forced quasi-periodic oscillation.
In this section we derive several results concerning recurrence properties of
abstract almost periodic trajectories and its link with the fractal dimension. The

172

Dimensional Aspects of Almost Periodic Dynamics
results are then applied to study the fractal dimension of forced almost periodic
oscillations in a class of control systems. The main results is based on [1, 2, 4].
The Fundamental Theorem on Diophantine Dimension. First of all, note that the
deﬁnition of an almost periodic function given in Sect.4.3 can be extended to the
functions with values in some metric space X. Suppose u(·) is X-almost periodic.
The set of ε-almost periods Tε(u) is relatively dense, i.e. for some L(ε) > 0 the inter-
section [a, a + L(ε)] ∩Tε(u) is not empty for all a ∈R. Let lu(ε) be the minimum
of such numbers L(ε). The limits
Di(u) := lim sup
ε→0+
ln lu(ε)
ln 1/ε
di(u) := lim inf
ε→0+
ln lu(ε)
ln 1/ε
(4.59)
are called the Diophantine dimension and lower Diophantine dimension respectively.
Suppose that χ : X →Y is a map between metric spaces X and Y satisfying the
Hölder condition on Mu with some exponent a ∈(0, 1], i.e. there is a constant C > 0
such that for all x, y ∈Mu we have ρY(χ(x), χ(y)) ≤CρX (x, y)α. Note that χ ◦u
is Y-almost periodic. The following proposition can be proved by straightforward
calculations.
Proposition 4.7 In the above conditions we have
Di(χ ◦u) ≤Di(u)
α
.
(4.60)
We know that an almost periodic function is uniformly continuous. Let δ(ε) be
such that ρX (u(t1), u(t2)) ≤ε provided by ∥t1 −t2∥∞≤δ(ε), where ∥· ∥∞is the
sup-norm in Rn. Let δ∗(ε) be the supremum of such numbers δ(ε). Consider the
value
Δ(u) := lim sup
ε→0+
ln δ∗(ε)
ln ε
.
(4.61)
It is clear that if u(·) satisﬁes the Hölder condition with an exponent α ∈(0, 1] then
Δ(u) ≤1
α.
Theorem 4.16
dimBH(u) ≤Di(u) + Δ(u),
dimBH(u) ≤di(u) + Δ(u).
(4.62)
Proof
ρ∞(u(· + t) −u(· + t)) ≤ε.
(4.63)
Indeed, there is an ε-almost period τ ∈[−t, −t + lu(ε)] for u(·). Then t := t +
τ is what we wanted. Now for arbitrary υ ∈H(u) there exists t ∈Rn such that
ρ∞(υ(·), u(· + t)) ≤ε and, consequently,

≤2ε. (4.64)
For convenience’ sake for Q ⊂R let Qu := {u(· + t) | t ∈Q} ⊂H(u). It follows
from (4.64) that it is sufﬁcient to cover the set [0,lu(ε)]u by open balls. Let Bε(u(· +
t)) be the open ball centered at u(· + t) with radius ε. It is clear that for t ∈R
Bε(u(· + t)) ⊃

t −δ∗(ε)

(4.65)
Thus, the set [0,lu(ε)]u can be covered by lu(ε)
δ∗(ε) + 1 open balls of radius ε and,
consequently, the set H(u) can be covered by the same number of balls of radius 3ε.
Therefore, N3ε(H(u)) ≤lu(ε)

Taking it to the lower/upper limit in (4.67) and using an arbitrary choice of δ we
ﬁnish the proof.
□
Remark 4.6 Consider the map i : H(u) →Mu, i(υ) := υ(0), from Theorem 4.6.
In the case of an arbitrary almost periodic function u(·) the map i is not a homeo-
morphism (and the set Mu does not have a natural group structure). Anyway, i is
still surjective and Lipschitz. As a consequence of this and Theorem 4.16 we have
dimBMu = dimBi(H(u)) ≤dimBH(u) ≤Di(u) + Δ(u) and a similar estimate for
dimBMu. In what follows we will use this fact to obtain some estimates of dimen-
sions for Mu in the case when u(·) is a forced almost periodic oscillation.

for the existence of exactly two almost periodic solutions to (4.68) one of which
is exponentially stable and one is unstable. We continue this investigation with the
following theorem. Note that the frequency domain conditions for the existence
of Bohr almost periodic solutions in general evolution equations are obtained in
[12, 22].
Theorem 4.17 Under assumptions (C1)–(C7) below for the exponentially stable
almost periodic solution u(·) to (4.68) we have
modZ(u) = modZ( f ).
(4.70)
Moreover,
Di(u) ≤Di( f ).
(4.71)
The estimate in (4.71) allows us to give an upper bound for the fractal dimension
of Mu (see Theorem 4.21 below).
Denote by W(z) = (c, (A −zI)−1b) the transfer function of system (4.68). In
what follows we assume that the pair (A, b) is completely controllable. Consider the
following conditions
(C1) The matrix A is Hurwitz.
(C2) The matrix A has a leading eigenvalue, i.e. a simple real eigenvalue λ0 such
that λ0 > Re λi, where λi are the other eigenvalues.
(C3) There exists a number ε > 0 satisfying the conditions Re λi < −ε < λ0 and
such that
Re W(ε + iω) > 0 for ω ≥0,
lim
ω→+∞ω2 Re W(ε + iω) > 0.
(C4) We have the inequality lim
z→∞[−zW(z)] = (c, b) ≥0.
(C5) The function φ(·) is monotonically increasing and convex, i.e.
φ′(υ) > 0, φ′′(υ) > 0 for any υ ∈R,
with
φ′(0) < −W(0)−1.
(C6) The following limits are valid:
lim
υ→+∞
φ(υ)
υ
= κ1, where

−W(0)−1 < κ1 < κ0 (κ0 < +∞),
−W(0)−1 < κ1 ≤κ0 (κ0 = +∞);
lim
υ→−∞
φ(υ)
υ
= κ2 < −W(0)−1.
From (C1)–(C4) it follows that W(0) < 0 (Lemma 1.1. in [5]) so the for-
mulation of (C5)–(C6) is correct. Put α0 := −W(0) = −(A−1b, c) > 0. Since

0 (eAsb, c)ds > 0. Let ψ(υ) := υ −α0φ(υ).

β+ := ψ(υ+). Consider the function


ds.
(4.72)
The last assumption is
(C7) sup
t∈R
g(t) < β+.
Remark 4.7 The method of Krasnoselskii is based on the fact that there is a cone
K ⊂Rn such that the family of operators eAs, s > 0, is strictly monotone w.r.t. K
(i.e. they map the points of K into its interior). Deﬁne by K+ the part of K lying in the
half-plane {(c, x) ≥0}. From (C1)–(C4) it follows that b ∈K+. Conditions (C1)–
(C4) guarantee the existence of a strictly invariant cone K such that the interior of
K has empty intersection with the plane {(c, x) = 0} (Lemma 2.2 in [5]). Therefore,
since eAsb ∈Int K we have (eAsb, c) ≥0.
Let f (·) be an E-almost periodic function (E is a Banach space). A sequence
{tk} ⊂R is called f -returning if the sequence { f (· + tk)} converges uniformly to
f (·). The following lemma can be found in [8].
Lemma 4.10 For two almost periodic functions u(·) and f (·) the following condi-
tions are equivalent:
(1) modZ(u) ⊂modZ( f ).
(2) For every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that Tε( f ) ⊂Tε(u).
(3) For every f -returning sequence there is an u-returning subsequence.

Let us show the inclusion modZ(u) ⊂modZ( f ). Let {tk}, k = 1, 2, . . . , be f -
returning, i.e. f (· + tk) converges to f (·) uniformly. Let a subsequence {t′
k} ⊂{tk}
be such that the sequence {υ∗(· + t′
k)} converges to some almost periodic function
ˆυ(·). It is easy to see that

(4.75)
Since φ(·) is continuously differentiable and υ∗(·) is bounded, the sequence {υ∗(· +
t′
k)} converges to a solution of (4.74) and supt∈R ˆυ(t) = supt∈R υ∗(t) < υ+. Thus, by
theuniqueness, ˆυ = υ∗andthesequence{t′
k}isυ∗-returning.Therefore,modZ(υ∗) ⊂
modZ( f ). The right-hand side of (4.73) for t ↔t + t′
k, that is u(t + t′
k), converges
uniformly (by the same argument) to u(·) and, consequently, {t′
k} is u-returning. Now
by Lemma 4.10 we get the inclusion modZ(u) ⊂modZ( f ).
To prove the inverse inclusion modZ(u) ⊃modZ( f ) note that the function ˙u(·)
is Rn-almost periodic with the same Fourier exponents as for u(·) (due to the fact
that Fourier series of ˙u(·) is the formal differentiation of the Fourier series for u(·)).
In particular, modZ(u) = modZ(˙u). Now express f (·) from (4.68) and the required
inclusion after what we have said is obvious.
Now we will show (4.71). For convenience, we write υ instead of υ∗. Suppose
ε > 0 and τ ∈Tε( f ). Put υmax := supt∈R υ(t) < υ+, Mυ(τ; t) := |υ(t + τ) −υ(t)|
and Mυ(τ) := supt∈R Mυ(τ; t). Then for some t0 we have |Mυ(τ; t0) −Mυ(τ)| ≤ε

lu( ˆCε) ≤l f (ε) and, hence, (4.71) holds.

Estimates of the Diophantine Dimension for Quasi-Periodic Trajectories. For
θ ∈Rm we denote by |θ|m the distance from θ to Zm. Clearly, | · |m deﬁnes a metric
on m-dimensional ﬂat torus Tm = Rm/Zm. An equivalent deﬁnition of a E-quasi-
periodic function u(·) is that there is a continuous function Φu : Tm →E and a vector
of rationally independent numbers ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm) such that u(t) = Φu(ωt). In
this case the numbers ω1, . . . , ωm are called 1-frequencies and the function Φu is
called the parametrization of u(·) given by 1-frequencies vector ω. Since the motion
t →ωt densely ﬁlls the torus Tm the function Φu(·) is uniquely determined by
ω. Note that 1-frequencies have to be multiplied by 2π to become the frequencies
deﬁned in Sect.4.3. We will also call these 1-frequencies (or the vector ω) an integral
base for u(·).
The integral base ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm) is a base of true size m if there is no integral
bases for u(·) with less than m frequencies. Suppose that u(t) = Φu(ωt). Then Φ
induces a map ˆΦ : Tm →H(u) given by ˆΦ(θ) := Φ(ω · +θ) ∈H(u). The base
ω1, . . . , ωm is called maximal if the map ˆΦ is a homeomorphism. It is clear that any
maximal base of m frequencies is a base of true size m. The following fundamental
theorem can be found in [24].
Theorem 4.18 For every E-quasi-periodic function there exists a maximal base.
Corollary 4.1 The hull H(u) of a quasi-periodic function having a base of true size
m is homeomorphic to Tm.
Since by (3.12), Chap.3, dimBH(u) ≥dimT H(u) we can combine Corollary 4.1
and Theorem 4.16 to get the following proposition.
Proposition 4.8 Suppose that u(·) is a E-quasi-periodic function having a base of
true size m and satisfying the Hölder condition with an exponent α ∈(0, 1]; then

(4.80)
Now we are going to investigate the link between the Diophantine dimension of
u(t) = Φu(ωt) and rational approximations of the m-tuple ω.
We say that an m-tuple ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm) of real numbers satisfy the Diophantine
condition of order β ≥0 if for some C > 0 and all natural q the inequality

numbers. Now we need to formulate a result from the geometry of numbers.
A lattice L in Rn is an additive subgroup generated by n linearly independent
vectors. For example, L = Zn is generated by standard basis e1, . . . , en. Suppose
that K is a closed convex centrally symmetric body in Rn and 0 is an interior point of
K. For k = 1, . . . , n let sk be the minimal number s such that s · K contains k linearly
independent vectors of L. The numbers s1, . . . , sn are called successive minima of
K w.r.t. L. Clearly, s1 ≤s2 ≤. . . ≤sn. We have the following fundamental theorem
of Minkowski (see [25]).
Theorem 4.19 In the above constructions for the successive minima of K w.r.t. L
we have
2n
n! vol(Rn/L) ≤s1 · . . . · sn · vol(K) ≤2n vol(Rm/L).
(4.82)
A subset D ⊂Rn is a fundamental domain of L if the natural projection π : Rn →
Rn/L, x →[x], is bijective on D. From Theorem 4.19 we deduce the following
lemma.
Lemma 4.11 Let ω1, . . . , ωm satisfy the Diophantine condition of order β ≥0 with
β(m −1) < 1. Then there is K > 0 such that the system of inequalities
|ω1τ|1 ≤ε, . . . , |ωmτ|1 ≤ε

1≤j≤m |ω jx −y j| ≤C′
T γ , |x| ≤T

,
(4.84)
for any ﬁxed C1 < C, where C is from (4.81). Consider the successive minima
s1, . . . , sm+1 of ΠT w.r.t. L = Zm+1. It follows that there is no non-zero integer
points in ΠT and, consequently, s1 ≥1. Since the volume of ΠT is proportional to
T mγ −1 for some constant C2 > 0 we have
sm+1 ≤s1 · . . . · sm+1 ≤C2T mγ −1.
(4.85)
Therefore, the parallelepiped (n + 1)C2T mγ −1 · ΠT contains a fundamental domain
of the lattice Zm+1 and, consequently, any translate of it contains an integer point.
So, it follows that for some constants C3 > 0 and C4 > 0 the system
|ωx −θ|m ≤C3T (m−1)γ −1

From Lemma 4.11 we have
Theorem 4.20 Let u(t) = Φu(ω0t, ω1t, . . . , ωmt) be an E-quasi-periodic function
with the 1-frequencies ω0, ω1, . . . , ωm, m ≥1. Suppose that Φu satisﬁes the Hölder
condition with an exponent α ∈(0, 1] and the m-tuple ω′ = ( ω1

the Diophantine condition of order β ≥0 with β(m −1) < 1. Then we have
Di(u) ≤1

(4.87)
Proof Put χ := Φu and υ(t) := (ωt). Now we can use Proposition 4.7 to get that
Di(u) = Di(χ ◦υ) ≤1
αDi(υ). Thus the problem is reduced to the estimation of the
Diophantine dimension for the linear ﬂow on torus.
Case 1: ω0 = 1. Every ε-almost period of υ(·) is a solution to the system
|τ|1 ≤ε, |ω1τ|1 ≤ε, . . . , |ωmτ|1 < ε.

4.88. From this we immediately get (4.87).
Case 2: ω = (ω0, . . . , ωm) does not have 1 as a frequency. Then for ε > 0 any ε-
almost period τ of υ(·) is a solution to
|ω0τ|1 ≤ε, . . . , |ωmτ|1 < ε.
(4.89)
Put ζ := ω0τ. Then system (4.89) becomes

where ω′

Di(υ) = Di(υ′) as their almost periods are proportional. Thus, the theorem is
proved.

Liouville Phenomenon in Estimates of Fractal Dimensions. Suppose that f (·) in
(4.68) is an Rn-quasi-periodic function with m frequencies ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm), i.e.
f (t) = Φ f (ωt). By Eq.(4.70) from Theorem 4.17 the exponentially stable almost
periodic solution is quasi-periodic with the same frequencies. While u(·) is C1 we
can not say the same about the parametrization Φu (see also the introduction to this
section). Hence, the results similar to Theorem 4.20 can not be directly applicable. In
this case the fact that Theorem 4.16 requires only the smoothness of u(·) is essential
for our investigations. Suppose that f (·) in (4.68) is an Rn-quasi-periodic function
with m frequencies ω = (ω1, . . . , ωm), i.e. f (t) = Φ f (ωt). By equation (4.70) from
Theorem 4.17 the exponentially stable almost periodic solution is quasi-periodic
with the same frequencies. While u(·) is C1 we can not say the same about the
parametrization Φu (see also the introduction to this section). Hence, the results
similar to Theorem 4.20 can not be directly applicable. In this case the fact that
Theorem 4.16 requires only the smoothness of u(·) is essential for our investigations.
Theorem 4.21 Under assumptions (C1)–(C9) for (4.68) suppose that f (t) =
Φ f (ωt), where ω = (ω0, ω1, . . . , ωm), m ≥1, and Φ f satisﬁes the Hölder condition

The dependence on the quality of rational approximations β in (4.92) is because of
inability to control any regularity of Φu in nonlinear systems. If the frequency-vector
ω is in some sense well-approximable it seems that an appearance of the Liuoville
phenomenon is possible. Its resulting effect is in that we can not control the fractal
dimension of forced quasi-periodic oscillations with well-approximable frequencies.
Note that in virtue of results in the previous paragraph for almost all ω we may put
β = 0 in (4.92).

Fractal Dimensions of Forced Almost Periodic Regimes

In this section we show the existence of forced almost periodic oscillations in Chua’s
circuit using the approach of Krasnosel’skii (partially described in Sect.4.7) and
compare the analytical upper estimates of the fractal dimension of the trajectory
closures with numerical simulations given by the standard box-counting algorithm.
The main results are borrowed from [4].

behaviour as well as the chaotic one; there is the possibility of presence of hidden
chaotic attractors and limit cycles (see [27] and the links therein). In the almost
periodically perturbed system the appearance of the so-called strange non-chaotic
attractors is possible [28]. Here we use the previously discussed method of Kras-
nosel’ski to obtain conditions for existence of an exponentially stable almost periodic
solution to (4.93). Next, we study the fractal dimensions of its closure and compare
the analytical upper estimates with the estimates provided by numerical experiments.
All the main results is borrowed from [4].

For two elements u, υ of a closed subspace E ⊂Cb(R; R) we write u ≺υ, if
υ −u ≥0. A cone segment ⟨u, υ⟩in E is the set of all w ∈E such that u ≺w ≺υ.
Theorem 4.22 Let (C1)–(C4) (deﬁned in the previous section) be satisﬁed and in
addition suppose that

(CH2) For υ0 ∈(0, 1] consider M := W(0)φ(υ0) + υ0 = (1 + W(0)κ0)υ0 > 0
and for g(t) from (4.72) we have
−M < sup
t∈R
g(t) < M.
(4.94)
Then system (4.93) has an exponentially stable almost periodic solution u∗(·) which
lies in {−υ0 < c∗u < υ0} and satisﬁes
modZ(u∗) = modZ( f ) and Di(u∗) ≤Di( f ).

From (C1)–(C4) we have (eAsb, c) ≥0 for all s ≥0 (see Remark 4.7). Since the
inequality in (4.94) is strict, we may assume that υ0 ∈(0, 1). Consider two constant
function υ1(t) ≡−υ0 and υ2(t) ≡υ0. We have
[Πυ1](t) + υ0 = −W(0)φ(−υ0) + υ0 + g(t) = M + g(t) > 0,
υ0 −[Πυ2](t) = υ0 + W(0)φ(υ0) −g(t) = M −g(t) > 0.
(4.97)
From the monotonicity of φ and (4.97) it follows that the operator Π is monotone on
the cone segment ⟨−υ0, υ0⟩and leaves it invariant. Now suppose υ1, υ2 ∈AP(R; R)

satisﬁed for all t ∈R. The exponential stability of u∗follows from the fact that it is a
solution of a linear system with the Hurwitz matrix. A proof of (4.95) can be carried
out analogously to the proof of Theorem 4.17.

Now, for simplicity, we put f (t) = Φ f (ω1t, ω2t), where Φ f : T2 →R3 satisﬁes
the Hölder conditions with an exponent α ∈(0, 1], and ω = ω1

ber. Suppose that the k-th convergent of ω, say qk, k = 1, 2, . . . , for some β ≥0
satisfy qk+1 = O(q1+β

for example, [13]) it follows the latter is equivalent to the existence of a constant
C > 0 such that for all integer p and positive integer q we have

i.e. ω satisﬁes the Diophantine conditions of order β ≥0. Analogously to Theorem

It is well-known that the numbers ω which satisﬁes the Diophantine condition

Numerical Experiments Figure4.1 shows a numerically constructed domain in the
space of parameters η2 ∈[0, 5], η3 ∈[0, 5], and η1 = 1.4 for which system (4.93)
satisﬁes (C1)–(C4). In the sequel we give a more formal investigation of the condi-
tions of Theorem 4.22 for a certain parameters.
We consider system (4.93) with parameters η1 = 1.4, η2 = 2.2, and η3 = 4.8. For
these parameters the characteristic polynomial of A has 3 real roots: λ0 ≈−0.258,
λ1 ≈−3.125, and λ2 ≈−3.817. We put ε := 1.5. By straightforward calculations
we get
W(z) = −η1 ·
z2 + (η3 + 1)z + η2 + η3
z3 + (1 + η1 + η3)z2 + (η2 + η3 + η1η3)z + η1η2

and, as a corollary,
Re W(iω −ε) = 1.4 · (2.7ω2 + 4.675) · (−ω2 + 0.55) + 2.8ω · (ω3 + 1.13ω)
(2.7ω2 + 4.675)2 + (ω3 + 1.13ω)2
.
(4.104)
The simplest analysis of the numerator in (4.104) shows that W(iω −ε) > 0 for all
ω. Next, it is clear that Re W(iω −ε) ∼0.14
ω2 as ω →∞. Thus conditions (C1)–(C4)
for the linear part is satisﬁed. From (4.103) it follows that
W(0) = −1 −η3
η2
= −35
11.
Therefore, to satisfy condition (CH1) we may take κ0 < 11
35 < κ1. We choose κ0 := 1

and κ1 := 1. Then for υ0 = 1 we have
M = (1 + W(0)κ0)υ0 = 1 −7

(4.106)
where b ∈Z and a ∈R are parameters. We take a = b−α, where α ∈(0, 1]. It is
known (see [31] p. 47) that the function in (4.106) satisﬁes the Hölder condition with
the exponent −ln a
ln b = α. We will use this function for numerical simulations.
Let the function Φ f : T2 →R3 satisfy the Hölder condition with an exponent
α ∈(0, 1] and consider f (t) := Φ f (ω1t, ω2t), where ω1

exponentially stable almost periodic solution of (4.93) given by Theorems 4.22,
4.23 gives the estimate
dimBMu∗≤1
α + 1.
(4.107)
In what follows we will compare this upper estimate with an estimates given by
numerical simulations.
In numerical experiments we use the standard box-counting algorithm. The coor-
dinates x, y, z in (4.93) are stretched in 25 times to prevent possible problems while
counting the boxes of large diameter. The set Mu∗is approximated by a part of the
trajectory u(·) with initial value u(0) = 0 (which is attracted to u∗) considered on
[0, T ]. We calculate the values of the solution in 108 points, which are uniformly dis-
tributed on [0, T ], with the use of Runge-Kutta method of 4–5th order.6 We calculate
ε-boxes required to cover u([0, T ]) (denote its number N(ε, T )) for ε = εk = 2−k/2,
where k = 10, . . . , 14. Next, by observations N(ε, T ) we have to estimate N(ε).
Note that the estimate of the Diophantine dimension in (4.95) allows to estimate the
time T for which the set Mu∗will lie in the δ-neighborhood of the set u∗([0, T ]).
For such T we may calculate the number of ε-boxes for ε ≪δ. In our case we have
T ≤C
 1
δ
1/α. Thus, for α = 3
2 and δ = 2−9 the estimate for T has the order of 104.
From this it follows that in simulations for large enough T the numbers N(ε, T ) stop
to change signiﬁcantly and therefore they can be considered as an estimate of N(ε).
For the observations (−ln ε, ln N(ε)), where N(ε) is the estimated number of ε-
boxes, the dependence ln N(ε) on −ln ε is approximated in two ways. The ﬁrst one
is the least squares method to ﬁnd the parameters of the linear model y = dx + υ.
The coefﬁcient d is then considered as a estimate of the fractal dimension of Mu∗.
For the second approximation we use the nonlinear model y = dx + βe−x + υ and
6We use the implementation of the method within the procedure solve_ivp of package scipy.integrate
of programming language Python 3.7.1. Parameter max_step of the procedure is chosen to be 2−9.

model gave the estimate of 2.76 that largely exceeds the analytical upper estimate of
2.5 and with the other estimated parameters (β = 14.72 and υ = −2.86) suggests
its unusability in this situation.

Chapter 5
Dimension and Entropy Estimates
for Dynamical Systems
Abstract In the present chapter various approaches to estimate the fractal dimension
and the Hausdorff dimension, which involve Lyapunov functions, are developed. One
of the main results of this chapter is a theorem called by us the limit theorem for the
Hausdorff measure of a compact set under differentiable maps. One of the sections of
Chap.5 is devoted to applications of this theorem to the theory of ordinary differential
equations. The use of Lyapunov functions in the estimates of fractal dimension and of
topological entropy is also considered. The representation is illustrated by examples
of concrete systems.

5.1.1
The Limit Theorem for Hausdorff Measures
In this subsection we shall derive an upper estimate for the Hausdorff dimension
of negatively invariant sets which is a generalization of the well-known Douady-
Oesterlé theorem [18]. For other generalizations see [1, 35]. We start with a statement
fordifferentiablemaps,applythisresultinSect.5.1.2tothedescriptionofﬁxedpoints
and invariant curves of maps and deduce in Sect.5.1.3 a ﬁrst upper estimate for the
Hausdorff dimension of the invariant sets of the Hénon map.
Let U be an open set in Rn, K ⊂U be a compact set, and
ϕ : U →Rn
(5.1)
be a C1-map. It follows that for any point u ∈U and each h ∈Rn with u + h ∈U
the Taylor expansion
ϕ(u + h) −ϕ(u) = Dϕ(u)h + o(h)

holds, where Dϕ(u) denotes the differential of ϕ at u. For any d ∈[0, n] we denote,
according to (2.4), Chap. 2, by ωd(Dϕ(u)) the singular value function of order d
for Dϕ(u) and according to Sect. 3.2, Chap. 3, by μH(Z, d) the outer Hausdorff
d-measure of a compact set Z.
Theorem 5.1 Suppose that for (5.1) there exist a sequence {Um}∞
m=0 of open subsets
of U, a compact set 
K ⊂U, a sequence of compact sets {Km}∞
m=0 and a number
d ∈(0, n] such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) For any m = 1, 2, . . . the m-th iterate ϕm is deﬁned on Um;
(2) For any m = 1, 2, . . . we have Km ⊂Um and ϕ j(Km) ⊂
K for
j = 0, 1, . . . ,
m −1;

Further, Theorem 5.1 [29–31] is called by us the limit theorem for the Hausdorff
measure. It’s proof will be given below. In the following subsection three important
corollaries of this theorem will be obtained.
Remark 5.1 The function κ in (5.3) can be considered as a regulating function for
the contraction property of ωd(Dϕ(·)) in 
K. If we deﬁne V (u) := log κ(u), u ∈
K,
the inequality (5.3) is equivalent to
sup
u∈
K
[log ωd(Dϕ(u)) + V (ϕ(u)) −V (u)] < 0 .
(5.4)
The inequality (5.4) contains the ﬁrst difference of V with respect to the dynamical
system {ϕk}k∈N0. Thus V = log κ can be considered as Lyapunov function for this
system.
In order to prove Theorem 5.1 we need the following lemma. Recall that for
a compact set Z ⊂Rn, a number d ∈(0, n] and a number δ > 0 the expression
μH(Z, d, ε) denotes the Hausdorff outer measure of Z at level ε and of order d.
For an ellipsoid E ⊂Rn and a number d ∈(0, n] the symbol ωd(E) denotes the
d-dimensional ellipsoid measure (cf. (2.5), Chap. 2).
Lemma 5.1 Let d ∈(0, n] and ε > 0 be numbers and E ⊂Rn be an ellipsoid such
that

ωd(E)
1/d ≤ε. Then the inequality

5.1 Upper Estimates for the Hausdorff Dimension of Negatively Invariant Sets

μH (E, d, λε) ≤Mωd(E)
holds, where λ := √d0 + 1, M := 2d0(d0 + 1)d/2 and d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1,
. . . , n −1}, s ∈(0, 1].
Proof Let E be given by

where a1 ≥a2 ≥· · · ≥an > 0 are the lengths of the semi-axes of E. Introduce
the notions E0 := E ∩Rd0, Rd0 := {(u1, . . . , ud0)}, and ς := ad0+1. We have ς ≤

ωd(E)
1/d ≤ε. In this case we can inscribe E0 into the parallelopiped P :=
[−a1, a1] × [−a2, a2] × · · · × [−ad0, ad0] and cover P by N cubes with edge of
length 2ς, where

The ellipsoid E is contained in E0 × 
Bς(0), where 
Bς(0) := Bς(0) ∩Rn−d0. Con-
sequently, E can be covered by sets of the form C × 
Bς(0), where C is a cube with
edges of length 2ς. If we introduce a rectangular coordinate system with the origin
in the center of such set and choose the ﬁrst d0 of coordinate axes to be parallel to
edges of the cube, then the coordinates of points of this set which are the most distant
from the center satisfy the following relations
|υ1| = · · · = |υd0| = ς,

It means that such a set is contained in a ball of radius ς√d0 + 1.

Let l > 0 be an arbitrary number. Obviously, there can be found a number m0 > 0
such that for all m > m0 the inequality

(5.7)
is true. Let us ﬁx m > m0 and denote by Dϕm(u) the differential of the map ϕm at
the point u ∈Km. The chain rule gives
Dϕm(u) = Dϕ(ϕm−1(u)) · Dϕ(ϕm−2(u)) · · · Dϕ(u) .

Let us use Lemma 2.1, Chap. 2, with κ = κ(m) and a number δ such that
sup

|Dϕm(u)| ≤δ,
κ(m) ≤δd,
and choose η > 0 such that (1 + cη)dκ(m) < l (this is possible by (5.7)). Let ε > 0
be so small that an ε-neighborhood of the compact set Km is contained in Dm and
the inequality
|ϕm(υ) −ϕm(u) −Dϕm(u)(υ −u)| ≤η|υ −u|
(5.10)
is true for all υ ∈Br(u) with r ≤ε. The following inclusion

Br(u)

⊂ϕm(u) + E + Bηr(0),
where E := Dϕm(u)Br(0), follows from (5.10). By virtue of Proposition 2.2, Chap. 2,
the set E is an ellipsoid in Rn whose semi-axes have the lengths rα j

According to Lemma 2.1, Chap. 2, the set E + Bηr(0) is included into an ellipsoid
E′ for which
ωd(E′) ≤(1 + κη)dκ(m)rd < lrd.
Thus, if {Br j(u j)} is a covering of Km by balls of radii r j ≤ε, then we can construct
a covering of ϕm(Km) by ellipsoids with

For an arbitrary compact set K′ ⊂Rn we put

ωd(E j),
where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite coverings of K′ by ellipsoids E j , for which

μ

ϕm(Km), d,l1/dε

≤lμH (Km, d, ε).
(5.12)
From Lemma 5.1 for an arbitrary compact set K′ ⊂Rn we obtain the inequality
μH (K′, d, λε) ≤c μ(K′, d, ε).
(5.13)
Indeed, for a ﬁnite covering of the compact set K′ by ellipsoids {E j} with

From this it follows that (5.13) is true.
Using (5.13) with K′ := ϕm(Km) and then (5.12), we obtain

Suppose that μH (Km, d) ≤μ0 < ∞for m = 1, 2, . . . . Passing to the limit in
(5.14) as ε →0, we obtain
μH

ϕm(Km), d

≤MlμH (Km, d) ≤Mlμ0.
(5.15)
From (5.7) it follows that for sufﬁciently large m the number l and, consequently, the
right-hand side of (5.15) will be as small as desired. So, assertion (a) is proved.
To prove assertion (b), let us assume that an arbitrary number l satisﬁes the
conditions λl1/d < 1 and Ml < 1. In this case μH (Km, d, ε) ≤μH (Km, d, λl1/dε),
and from (5.14) we obtain the inequality
μH

ϕm(Km), d, λl1/dε

≤MlμH (Km, d, λl1/dε).
Taking into account the inclusion Km ⊂K ⊂ϕm(Km) for m = 1, 2, . . . , from the
last inequality we can see that
μH (K, d, λl1/dε) ≤MlμH (K, d, λl1/dε).
Therefore μH (K, d, λl1/dε) = 0 and, consequently, μH

ϕm(Km), d, λl1/dε

= 0.
Passing to the limit as ε →0 in these two equalities, we get μH

ϕm(Km), d

= 0
and μH (K, d) = 0. From the last equality it follows that dimH K ≤d. Note that
inequality (5.3) is also satisﬁed for d −ε with ε > 0 sufﬁciently small. This implies
that dimH K ≤d −ε, i.e. dimH K < d.

5.1.2
Corollaries of the Limit Theorem for Hausdorff
Measures
In this subsection we prove three corollaries from Theorem 5.1 originating from [9].
Corollary 5.1 Suppose that for (5.1) on a compact set K ⊂U there exists a contin-
uous positive function κ : K →R+ and a number d ∈[0, n] such that
sup

Then it holds:


ϕm(K), d

= 0;
(b) If K ⊂ϕ(K), then dimH K < d.
Proof For the proof it is sufﬁcient to put in Theorem 5.1 
K := K and to deﬁne
recurrently the sequences of sets {Um} and {Km} by

U1 := U, Um+1 := ϕ−1(Um), K1 := K, Km+1 := K ∩ϕ−1(Km), m = 1, 2, . . . .
Here ϕ−1(·) denotes the preimage of a given set under the map ϕ.
□
In the following corollaries we denote by α1(u) ≥α2(u) ≥· · · ≥αn(u) the sin-
gular values of Dϕ(u).
Corollary 5.2 Suppose for (5.1) that U is an open simply connected domain in Rn
and there exist a compact set 
K and a continuous positive on 
K function κ : 
K →R+
such that the relations

(5.17)
are true.
Then in U there can not exist any smooth and closed curve Γ which satisﬁes
ϕ(Γ ) = Γ .
In order to prove Corollary 5.2 we need the following lemma which is connected
with the existence problem of minimal surfaces spanning a given curve, the so-called
Plateau problem [16, 23, 42].
Lemma 5.2 Given a closed smooth curve Γ in Rn(n ≥3). Then there exists a rec-
tiﬁable surface S of ﬁnite Lebesgue area which spans it.
Proof (Sketch) Suppose that γ : [0, 1] →Rn is a smooth parameterization of Γ
such that γ (0) = γ (1) and γ ([0, 1]) = Γ . Choose a point z /∈Γ and connect any
point of Γ with z by the segment of a straight line. In the result we get a piecewise
smooth surface S with ﬁnite two-dimensional Lebesgue measure since the lengths of
segments connecting Γ with z are bounded from above by a constant and the length
of Γ is ﬁnite. Note that S can have self-intersections. It is clear that the piecewise
smoothness of S is preserved.
□
Proof of Corollary 5.2
Suppose the opposite, i.e. suppose that there exists such
a curve Γ . Let us span on Γ some piecewise smooth surface S ≡K ⊂U of ﬁnite
area with μH(S, 2) < ∞. The existence of such a surface is guaranteed by Lemma
5.2. Since ϕm(Γ ) = Γ for m = 1, 2, . . . we have
inf
m≥0 μH

(5.18)
On the other hand by Theorem 5.1 with Um := U and Km := ϕ(K) we obtain
lim
m→+∞μH

ϕm(K), 2) = 0,
which contradicts the inequality (5.18)

(5.20)
Then the map ϕ has in D at most a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed points.
Proof First of all notice that by Corollary 5.2 in D there is no smooth closed curve
Γ satisfying the relation ϕ(Γ ) = Γ .
Let us suppose now that the conclusion is not valid, i.e. that D contains an inﬁnite
sequence {um} of different ﬁxed points of ϕ. By (5.19) we have for all um ∈
K.
Since 
K is a compact set, there exists a limit point υ of the sequence {um} and
υ −ϕ(υ) = limm→∞

um −ϕ(um)

= 0 (we remain the old indices). Since u −ϕ(u)
is an analytic function we see that in the neighborhood of υ the representation
u −ϕ(u) = (I −Dϕ(υ)) (u −υ) + h(u),
(5.21)
is possible, where h(u) is analytic in D and ∥h(u)∥= O

∥u −υ∥2
as u →υ.
Denote by λ1 = λ1(υ), . . . , λn = λn(υ) the eigenvalues of Dϕ(υ) numbered so
that |λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥· · · ≥|λn|. Using Weyl’s inequality (Proposition 2.6, Chap. 2)
|λ1 . . . λk| ≤α1(υ) . . . αk(υ),
k = 1, . . . , n
and inequality (5.20) we obtain
|λ1λ2| <
κ(υ)
κ(ϕ(υ)) = 1.
If the number |λ1| is less than 1, then the ﬁxed point υ is asymptotically stable for
the iterations of ϕ and, consequently, it is an isolated point. Since υ is not an isolated
one, we have |λ1| ≥1 > |λ2|. Thus, it follows that λ1 is a real number. By Jordan’s
theorem there exists a regular real n × n matrix M such that
M−1Dϕ(υ)M = diag (λ1, C),
(5.22)
where C is a real (n −1) × (n −1) matrix with eigenvalues all have modulus smaller
than 1. In order to ﬁnd all ﬁxed points of the map ϕ in the neighborhood of υ let us
perform in (5.21) the change u = υ + M (x, y)T with x ∈R and y ∈Rn−1. Using
(5.22), we replace the ﬁxpoint equation u −ϕ(u) = 0 by the pair of equations
x −λ1x + h1(x, y) = 0,
(I −C)y + h2(x, y) = 0,
(5.23)

where h1, h2 are analytic functions such that |h1|, |h2| = O(|x|2 + |y|2) as (x, y) →
(0, 0). Since det(I −C) ̸= 0 from the implicit function theorem it follows that the
second equation in (5.23) has a solution y(x), which is analytic in some interval x ∈
(−δ, δ), and y(0) = 0. Therefore each solution of system (5.23) in a neighborhood
of (0, 0) can be represented in the form

x, y(x)

, where in a neighborhood of 0 the
number x is a root of the equation
x −λ1x + h1

x, y(x)

= 0.
(5.24)
Since υ is a non-isolated ﬁxed point and the right-hand side of (5.24) is analytic
for x ∈(−δ, δ) it is identically equal to zero in all the interval. Thus, the solution
of system (5.23) in a neighborhood of (0, 0) is an analytic arc

x, y(x)

with x ∈
(−δ, δ).
Thus, it follows that any non-isolated ﬁxed point υ of the map ϕ lies on an analytic
curve passing through υ and entirely consists of ﬁxed points of ϕ. Moreover all ﬁxed
points in the neighborhood of υ belong to this curve. Let Γ be one of these analytic
curves. Suppose that Γ is not the part of a bigger curve of such kind. It is obvious
that all limit points Γ belong to it. Consequently Γ is a compact set. It follows
by Milnor’s theorem (Theorem A.2, Appendix A) that a smooth one-dimensional
simply connected manifold is diffeomorphic either to an interval of the real axis R or
to the circle S1. Consequently Γ is a closed curve. But any point Γ is a ﬁxed point
of ϕ. It means that ϕ(Γ ) = Γ . But this contradicts to the fact which was stated at
the beginning of the proof.
□
The following results (Lemma 5.3 and Theorem 5.2) were obtained by Smith [40].
Lemma 5.3 For each simple closed contour γ ⊂Rn there exist a plane E ⊂Rn
and a closed circular disc D ⊂E such that D ∩πγ is a simple arc joining distinct
points p and q on the boundary ∂D of D, where π : Rn →E denotes the orthogonal
projection on E.
Proof Let υ = u2 −u1, where u1, u2 are distinct points on γ . If c ∈R then Lc =
{u ∈Rn|(υ, u) = c} is a hyperplane in Rn which is orthogonal to υ with respect to the
usual inner product in Rn. If c1 = (υ, u1) and c2 = (υ, u2), then u1 ∈Lc1, u2 ∈Lc2
and c2 −c1 = |υ|2 > 0. Since γ is connected, the set γ ∩Lc is non-empty when
c1 ≤c ≤c2. If γ ∩Lc is an inﬁnite set, then Lc is tangential to one of the regular
arcs constituting γ . The values of c for which this property is satisﬁed form a set
of Lebesgue measure zero by Sard’s theorem (Theorem A.3, Appendix A). We can
therefore choose c with c1 < c < c2 such that γ ∩Lc is a ﬁnite set. At each point p
of this ﬁnite set we can assume that γ has a tangent vector τ(p) with (υ, τ(p)) ̸= 0.
Choose a point p0 in the ﬁnite set γ ∩Lc and choose an (n −1)-ﬂat F ⊂Lτ such
that p0 ∈F and p /∈F for all other points p in γ ∩Lc. If E is a plane in Rn orthogonal
to F and π : Rn →E is the orthogonal projection, then πp0 ∈πγ and πp ̸= πp0
for all points p ̸= p0 on γ . Since (υ, τ(p0)) ̸= 0, the plane curve πγ has a unique

200

tangent line L0 at the point πp0. We can choose a small open arc γ0 ⊂γ such that
πγ0 is approximately equal to a line segment of L0 which has πp0 as its centre. Since
γ ′ = γ \ γ0 is closed and πp0 ∈πγ ′ we can choose a small circular disc D ⊂E
with centre at πp0 such that D ∩πγ ′ is empty. Then D ∩πγ = D ∩πγ0 and this is
a simple are joining distinct points p, q on ∂D.
□
Remark 5.2 In Lemma 5.3 sufﬁcient smoothness of the simple closed contour, i.e.
of a parameterized 1-boundary in Rn, is assumed. This allows the use of Sard’s
theorem to show the existence of an orthogonal projection onto a plane. This plays
a role similar to that of the rigid rotation R used in the proof of Proposition B.3,
Appendix B.
We now come to a central result which connects for a given map an upper Haus-
dorff dimension bound for invariant sets with the non-existence of invariant closed
curves. The direct proof given below uses Lemma 5.3 which is based on Sard’s the-
orem and properties of the winding number of a vector ﬁeld in the plane. We shall
note that this result also follows from the more general result of Muldowney and Li
(Theorem 10.12, Chap.10).
Theorem 5.2 Suppose that U ⊂Rn is simply-connected and ϕ : U →U is a contin-
uous map which satisﬁes ϕ(U) ⊂K0 ⊂U, where K0 is a compact set. If the maximal
invariant set K1 of ϕ in U has Hausdorff dimension dimH K1 < 2, then ϕ(γ ) ̸= γ
for every simple closed contour γ ⊂U, supposed that ϕ is one-to-one on γ .
Proof Assume that the theorem is false, i.e. suppose that ϕ(γ ) = γ for some simple
closed contour γ ⊂U. With this γ , Lemma 5.3 associates an orthogonal projection
π : Rn →E and a circular disc D ⊂E. For each point q in E \ πγ let w(q) the
winding number about q (see Sect. B.3, Appendix B) of the projected vector ﬁeld
along the closed plane curve πγ . Then w(q) is an integer which remains constant
as q varies over any connected component of E \ πγ . In particular w(q) is constant
in each of the components D1, D2 of D \ πγ. Furthermore w(q2) = w(q1) ± 1 when
q1 ∈D1 and q2 ∈D2. Hence w(q) ̸= 0 in at least one of the components D1, D2.
Since dimH K1 < 2, we have dimH πK1 < 2 and therefore neither D1, nor D2
lies wholly within πK1. Hence, a point q0 can be chosen in D1 ∪D2 such that q0 /∈
πK1 and w(q0) ̸= 0. Then q0 /∈πϕ j(K0) for some integer j ≧0 because πK1 =

j≥0 πϕ jK0.
Since γ can be continuously contracted to a point within the simply-connected
set U, the plane curve πϕk+1γ can be contracted to a point within the set πϕk+1(U).
Since γ = ϕk+1(γ ) and ϕ(U) ⊂K0 it follows that πγ can be contracted to a point
within πϕk(K0). Sinceq0 /∈πϕk(K0) the winding number aboutq0 of the contracting
curve remains constant throughout this continuous deformation. Its initial value is
w(q0) and its ﬁnal value is zero because πγ is contracted to a point distinct from q0.
However, q0 was chosen so that w(q0) ̸= 0.

Application of the Limit Theorem to the Hénon Map
Consider the Hénon map ([4, 21, 27, 35, 37]) ϕ : R2 →R2 given by
(x, y) ∈R2 −→(a + by −x2, x),
(5.25)
where a > 0 and 0 < b < 1 are parameters.
Suppose that K ⊂R2 is a compact set, which is invariant with respect to {ϕm}.
In order to get Hausdorff dimension estimates for K, we want to use Corollary 5.1.
This corollary says that dimH K < 1 + s for some s ∈[0, 1], if
α1(u) αs
2 (u)κ (ϕ(u))
κ (u)
< 1,
∀u ∈K,
(5.26)
where α1(u) ≥α2(u) are the singular values of the differential of ϕ at u = (x, y) and
κ (u) is a continuous positive scalar function on K. We demonstrate two variants: the
ﬁrst employs the function κ (u) ≡1, the second is based on a function κ (u) ̸≡1.
It is easy to see that the Jacobian matrix of ϕ at an arbitrary point u = (x, y) is
given by
J(x, y) =

Since α1(x) α2 (x) ≡| det J(x, y)| = b we can write for the second singular value
α2(x) =
b
α1(x).
(5.28)
Suppose that δ > 0 is a number such that
K ⊂{(x, y)


|x| ≤δ} .
(5.29)
The following results (Theorems 5.3 and 5.4) have been obtained in [12].
Theorem 5.3 Suppose that K is a compact and invariant with respect to {ϕm} set
and the inclusion (5.29) is satisﬁed. Then
dimH K < 1 +

Proof Under consideration of (5.28) and (5.29) the condition (5.26) is satisﬁed if
bsα1−s

(x) < 1,
∀x ∈[−δ, δ].
Since the function α1(x) takes on [−δ, δ] the maximum for |x| = δ, the last inequality
is satisﬁed if
bsα1−s
1
(δ) < 1.
(5.30)
Using the fact that α1(x) ≥0 for all x, this is equivalent to the inequality
s >
log α1(δ)
log α1(δ) −log b.
□
Remark 5.3 The Hénon map was investigated numerically in [27]. It follows from
the results of this paper that for a = 1.4, b = 0.3 the parameter δ in (5.29) can be
taken as δ = 1.8. Theorem 5.3 gives with such a δ the estimate dimH K ≤1.523.
Our next Hausdorff dimension bound for a compact invariant set of the Hénon
map improves the result of Theorem 5.3 and does not need any information from
numerical experiments.
Let us introduce the values

With this we get for all x ∈R h(x) ≤h3(x), where
h3(x) := log[4x2 + (1 + b)2] −κ(Cx2 −a)

all points with h′

Employing C = aτ 2 < 1, we conclude from (5.31) that 4/(κC) −(1 + b)2 ≥0.
This guaranties that h3(x) is maximal on R for x satisfying

Using the representation of κ through τ we see, that the right-hand side of the last

h(x) ≤M, ∀x ∈(−∞, −1/τ).

Consider in (5.25) again the parameters a = 1.4, b = 0.3. A direct calculation
gives τ = 0.63 and κ = 0.450. Since (5.30) is satisﬁed, we conclude on the base of
Theorem 5.4 that dimH K < 1.510. Suppose that (x±, y±) are the ﬁxed points of ϕ.
The ﬁrst coordinates are given by the roots of

If the compact and invariant set K is a global attractor, all ﬁxed points are contained

As a consequence we see that, independently of the choice of κ(u) in (5.26), there
is no better estimate than
dimH K ≤1 +

(5.33)
For the values a = 1.4, b = 0.3 we get from (5.33) dimH K ≤1.500 . . . .
Note that the Hausdorff dimension bounds from Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 are also
bounds for the fractal dimension. This fact follows from the equality (5.28) which is
in fact Chen’s condition (see Sect.5.4).

Proof Consider the map (ϕT )m := ϕ(mT, ·). Since (ϕT )mK ⊂U there exists an
open set Um, K ⊂Um ⊂U with ϕ(t, u) ∈U for all (t, u) in [0, mT ] × Um. Then
(ϕT )m(u) = ϕ(mT, u) = ϕmT (u), ∀u ∈Um . If we put A(t) := J(t, ϕ(t, u)), 
(t) := (t, ϕ(t, u)) then (5.37) implies that inequality (2.43) of Corollary 2.10,
Chap. 2, holds for 0 ≤t ≤mT. Corollary 2.10, Chap. 2, then gives

Example 5.1 Consider the forced Dufﬁng equation
¨x + 2δ ˙x + x3 −x = ε cos ωt ,
(5.41)
where δ, ε, ω are positive parameters. Introducing the new variable y := ˙x + δx , we
get ˙y = ¨x + δ ˙x = (1 + δ2)x −x3 −δy + ε cos ωt. Thus (5.41) is equivalent to the
planar system
˙x = y −δx,
˙y = (1 + δ2)x −x3 −δy + ε cos ωt .
(5.42)
It was shown in [26] by numerical calculations that for certain parameter values
δ, ε, ω there exists a strange attractor in the system generated by (5.42).

Since (5.42) is point-dissipative, there exists a compact invariant set. In the next
theorem [40] we give an upper estimate of the Hausdorff dimension of such a set.

Introduce the set D := {(x, y) ∈R2 | V (x, y) ≤1

If V (x, y) < 12 c2 then (1 + δ2 −x2)2 < 12c2 and 0 ≤x2 < 1 + δ2 + 2−1/2c. It

(5.47)
then the matrix (5.46) is positive-deﬁnite.
These conditions are equivalent to (5.37) provided that we choose  and a as in

Since trJ ≡−2 δ, the condition (5.38) reduces to [2 −d] −2δ < 0.

Hence
dimH K ≤2(1 −−1δ) .
□
The following simple proposition [11] resulting also from Theorem 5.5 shows the
connection between the divergence of the vector ﬁeld, the zero Lebesgue measure
of the considered set, and the Hausdorff dimension of this set.
Theorem 5.7 Suppose that there exists a positive continuously differentiable on K
function κ(·) such that
div (κ f ) ≡∂(κ f1)

+ ∂(κ f2)
∂u2
+ · · · + ∂(κ fn)

for all (t, u) ∈[0, τ] × K. Then K has zero Lebesgue measure.
Proof Since
∂(κ f1)
∂u1
+ · · · + ∂(κ fn)
∂un
= κ tr D2 f + ˙κ,
the condition of Theorem 5.5 is satisﬁed with d0 = n −1, s = 1 and the auxiliary
function V (u) := log κ(u). Consequently, dimH K < n, and by Proposition 3.19,
Chap. 3, μL(K, n) = 0.
□
Now we suppose that U0 is a bounded set, and the relations K ⊂U0 ⊂U, ϕ(t, u) ∈
U ∀u ∈U0 and t ∈[0, ∞), (ϕτ)m(u) = ϕ(mτ, u) ∈U0 are true for any u ∈K and
m ≥0.
The proof of the following theorem [11] is analogous to the proof of Theorem
5.5. It is also based on the ﬁrst corollary from the limit theorem.
Theorem 5.8 Suppose the existence of an integer number d0 ∈[0, n −1], a real
number s ∈(0, 1], a logarithmic norm Λ, and a continuously differentiable on U0
function V (·) such that

The Generalized Bendixson Criterion
If we put in Corollary 5.2 from the limit theorem ϕ := ϕτ (the time-τ-map of system
(5.34)), U = U0, 
K := ϕτ(U0), and use Lemma 5.4, then we obtain [11]:
Theorem 5.9 Suppose, there exist a logarithmic norm Λ and a continuously differ-

Choosing again the logarithmic norm deﬁned by the Euclidean norm, we get:

On the Finiteness of the Number of Periodic Solutions
Theproofofthefollowingtheorem[11]isbasedonCorollary5.3ofthelimittheorem.
Theorem 5.10 Suppose that system (5.34) with J := R and U := Rn is dissipative,
analytic, and T -periodic in t. If a logarithmic norm Λ and a continuously differen-
tiable function V (·) can be found such that the inequality
Λ

D2 f (t, u)[2]
+ ˙V (t, u) < 0,
∀(t, u) ∈R × Rn,
(5.48)
is satisﬁed, then system (5.34) has only a ﬁnite number of T -periodic solutions.
Proof Put D := {u| |u| < ς + 1}. By virtue of dissipativity there exist a number
ς > 0 and an integer number k > 0 such that for any u ∈D the solution ϕ(t, u) of
system (5.34) exists for all t ≥0 and |ϕ(kT, u)| ≤ς.
Let us deﬁne the map ϕ : D →D by ϕ(u) = ϕ(kT, u). Then for 
K = {u| |u| ≤
ς} the inclusions
ϕ(D) ⊂
K ⊂D
take place. Obviously, there exists a bounded open set U ⊂Rn such that ϕ(t, u) ∈U
for all (t, u) with t ∈[0, kT ] and u ∈D. Condition (5.48) implies
sup
&


D2 f (t, u)[2]

on the compact set [0, kT ] × U. Thus, by Lemma 5.4 we can ﬁnd a continuous
positive on 
K function κ, such that
α1(u)α2(u) <
κ(u)
κ(ϕ(u)),
∀u ∈
K.
Since the vector function f is analytic, we see that the map ϕ is also analytic.
Thus, by Corollary 5.3 of the limit theorem ϕ has only a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed points
in D. It means that system (5.34) has a ﬁnite number of kT -periodic solutions. But
each T -periodic solution is kT -periodic too.
□
Taking the logarithmic matrix norm deﬁned by the Euclidean vector norm, we
obtain from Theorem 5.10 the following result.
Corollary 5.8 Suppose, system (5.34) with U := Rn is dissipative, analytic, and T -
periodic with respect to t. If there is a continuously differentiable function V such
that the inequality
λ1(t, u) + λ2(t, u) + ˙V (t, u) < 0,
∀(t, u) ∈R × Rn,
is true, then system (5.34) has only a ﬁnite number of T -periodic solutions.

Convergence Theorems
Now let system (5.34) be autonomous, i.e.
dϕ
dt = f (ϕ),
(5.49)
where f : U →Rn is C1 and U ⊂Rn is open. Suppose that there exists a bounded
simply connected open set U0 in Rn such that U0 ⊂U and any positive semi-orbit of
(5.49) which meets the boundary of U0 crosses it strictly inwards U0. We also suppose
that system (5.49) has only a ﬁnite number of equilibrium states in the domain U0.
A positive semi-orbit γ+(u) of a solution ϕ(·, u) of (5.49) with u ∈U0 is said to
converge to an equilibrium state υ if ϕ(t, u) →υ as t →+∞. Then the following
theorem [31] is true.
Theorem 5.11 Suppose that there exist a logarithmic norm Λ and a continuously
differentiable on U0 function V (·) such that
Λ

Df (u)[2]
+ ˙V (u) < 0,
∀u ∈U0.
(5.50)
Thenanypositivesemi-orbit of system(5.49) inU0 converges tooneof theequilibrium
states, i.e. the system is gradient-like.
Proof Let ϕ(·, u) be a solution of (5.49) whose positive semi-orbit for t ≥0 is
located in U0. From the boundedness of U0 it follows that the ω-limit set ω(u) of
ϕ(·, u) is not empty.
Let us show that any ω-limit point υ′ ∈ω(u) is an equilibrium state.
Suppose the opposite. Then by Pugh’s closing lemma (Theorem A.4, Appendix
A) for any ε > 0 a C1-vector function g(·) can be found such that on U0 we have
∥f −g∥C1 < ε, and system (5.49) with the vector ﬁeld g instead of f has a closed
trajectory Γ passing trough the point υ′. Take ε so small that
Λ

Dg(u)[2]
+ ˙V (u) < 0,
∀u ∈U0.
(5.51)
and, besides, any trajectory of g meeting the boundary of U0 crosses it strictly inwards
U0. But in this case by Theorem 5.9 in U0 there is no closed trajectories of system
(5.49). The contradiction obtained shows that the set ω(u) consists of equilibrium
states.
Since we suppose that system (5.49) has only isolated equilibrium states, we see
that from the connectness of the ω-limit set it follows that ω(u) consists of a unique
equilibrium state.

For the proof of Theorem 5.12 we need some notions and an auxiliary proposition.
Put for any z ∈R
h(z) := c1z2 + 2c2z,
where c1, c2 are arbitrary real numbers.
The following simple lemma from [5] (whose proof we omit) deﬁnes the minimum
of h(z) on the segment [−Δ1, Δ2], where Δ1 = (l −1)r and Δ2 = (l + 1)r.
Lemma 5.5 Let

d) c1 > 0 and c2 −c1Δ1 ≥0 ,
h(−c2/c1) , if

Proof of Theorem 5.12 Let us make in (5.53) the change of variables (x, y, z) →

˙x = −σ x + σ
ς y −a
ς yz,
˙y = ςx(r −z) −y,
˙z = −bz + ςxy.
(5.56)
Denote by J(x, y, z) the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of (5.56) at (x, y, z)
and let λ1(y, z) ≥λ2(y, z) ≥λ3(y, z) be the eigenvalues of the symmetrized matrix
1
2(J(x, y, z)∗+ J(x, y, z)).
The proof of the theorem is based on Corollary 5.9. Therefore we must check the
inequality λ1(y, z) + λ2(y, z) < 0 in the dissipativity region of system (5.53).
We have λ1(y, z) + λ2(y, z) = tr J(x, y, z) −λ3(y, z). In order to verify the

Assume that c1 > 0. If Q(ς) ≤−lrc1, then the theorem is true according to (5.60),
(5.64) and Lemma 5.5 (case (c)). If Q(ς) ≥lrc1, then the theorem holds by (5.61),
(5.65) and Lemma 5.5 (case (d)). Thus, under condition (1) the theorem is proved.
Now we suppose that condition (2) of the theorem is satisﬁed, i.e. lrc1 > |Q(ς)|.
In this case the theorem follows from Lemma 5.5 (case (e)) and relations (5.62) and
(5.66).
□
From Theorem 5.12 we obtain the following simple condition [5] for convergence
of the Lorenz system (1.12), Chap. 1.
Corollary 5.10 Let a = 0. Each positive semi-orbit of system (5.53) converges to
an equilibrium if
r < (b + 1)(b/σ + 1) and b ≤2

Proof We have P(ς) := (b −1)ς2, Q(ς) := σ(σ + 1). Condition (1) of Theorem
5.12 is reduced to the inequalities
lr(b −1)ς2 ≤σ(σ + 1) and ςlr + σ/ς < 2

(σ + b)(b + 1).
Take ς := σ/√(σ + b)(b + 1). Then these inequalities take the form
lr(b −1)σ ≤(σ + b)(σ + 1)(b + 1) and r < (σ + b)(b + 1)

Remark 5.4 For σ = 10, b = 8/3 Corollary 5.10 guarantees the convergence in
the Lorenz system (1.12), Chap. 1, for r < 4.4.
The following second corollary [5] of Theorem 5.12 can be useful for the study
of some concrete systems reducible to the generalized Lorenz system.
Corollary 5.11 Suppose that σ = ar. Then each positive semi-orbit of system (5.53)
converges to an equilibrium if
r < (b + 1)(b/σ + 1)/l2.
(5.67)
Proof We have Q(ς) ≡0. Condition (1) of Theorem 5.12 is reduced to the inequal-

(5.68) can be written as
r2 < (σ + b)(b + 1)
l2a
.
Substituting here a := σ/r, we obtain
r < (σ + b)(b + 1)

.
□
In the proof of Theorem 5.12 for the estimation of the dissipativity region D of
the generalized Lorenz system the inclusion
D ⊂{x| −∞< x < ∞} × D1
was used. A further improvement of conditions for the convergence of system (5.53)
is possible if one uses a better inclusion. In some cases it is possible to use Lemma
1.6, Chap. 1. To show this let us formulate the following result for the Lorenz system
(1.12), Chap. 1.

Further, for these values of σ and b by using Lyapunov functions, we shall obtain
a stronger result for the Lorenz system.

Euler’s Equations Describing the Rotation of a Rigid
Body in a Resisting Medium
Let us investigate now some concrete physical systems which can be transformed
to the generalized Lorenz system. Consider in a resisting medium the equation for
a rotating rigid body attached to the center of mass with no torque and a constant
angular moment directed along one of the main axes.
Euler’s equations describing such a motion are given by [17]
A1 ˙ω1 = (A2 −A3)ω2ω3 −s1ω1 + m,
A2 ˙ω2 = (A3 −A1)ω1ω3 −s2ω2,
A3 ˙ω3 = (A1 −A2)ω1ω2 −s3ω3,
(5.69)
where Ai are the moments of inertia of the body, ωi are the components of the angular
velocity vector, m is the constant moment of external forces, si are the coefﬁcients
of resistance (i = 1, 2, 3).
In order to have several equilibrium states in (5.69) we shall suppose that the
inequality
(A1 −A2)(A3 −A1) > 0,
(5.70)
is satisﬁed. (Under the opposite inequality system (5.69) has only one equilibrium
state for any value of m.) The change of variables [24]

A Nonlinear System Arising from Fluid Convection in a

In the book [25] the convection of a ﬂuid within a rotating ellipsoid is considered.
The axis of rotation coincides with one of the main axes of the ellipsoid and the angle
between this axis and the gravity vector is different from zero. Convective motion is
generated by an outer horizontal-irregular heating.

A System Describing the Interaction of Three Waves in
Plasma
The systems of the two physical examples considered above were reduced to the
generalized Lorenz system with a positive parameter a. Now we shall investigate
a system that, by a change of variables, will be reduced to the generalized Lorenz
system with a < 0.
In the book [34] (see also [36]), studying waves in plasma, the following system
of equations was deduced and analysed:
˙x = hy −κ1x −yz,
˙y = hx −κ2y + xz,
˙z = −z + xy.
(5.76)
This system (we call it Rabinovich’s system) describes the interaction of three reason-
ably coupled waves, two of them being parameterically excited. Here, the parameter
h is proportional to the amplitude of pumping, parameters κ1, κ2 are normed damping
coefﬁcients.
The change of variables
(x, y, z) →(κ1κ2h−1y , κ1x , κ1κ2h−1z) ,

σ := κ−1

1 κ−1
2 h2.
System (5.76) was studied by numerical methods for ﬁxed κ1 = 1, κ2 = 4, and
various parameter h. For h = 4.92 the existence of a strange attractor was stated. We
shall suppose further that κ1 = 1 and drop, for brevity, the index of parameter κ2.
Let ς be a positive number. Denote by ς0 a positive number such that

librium if h2 < λ0.
We would like to remark that the result of Theorem 5.16 will be strengthened fur-
ther (see Theorem 5.27) due to the application of a Lyapunov function. But the proof

224

of this theorem, in contrast to the two previous examples, uses not only condition (1)
but also condition (2) of the Theorem 5.12 on convergence of the generalized Lorenz
system.
Proof of Theorem 5.16 In the notation of Theorem 5.12 on convergence we have

we have P(κ2/3ς2) < 0 for ς > ς0. Taking into account the relations P(−∞) =
−∞, P(+∞) = +∞and P(0) = κ6/ς6, we can conclude that the inequalities
(5.77) for ς > ς0 are equivalent to
τ2(ς) < h2 < λ(ς),
where for ς > ς0 we have an interval

τ2(ς), λ(ς)

̸= ∅. Consequently, for h2 ∈

τ2(ς), λ(ς)

and ς > ς0 system (5.76) is convergent.
Let us show that (5.76) is convergent for h2 < λ(ς) and arbitrary ς > ς0. This will
prove the theorem. Let us remark that for h2 < κ the unique equilibrium of the system

is globally asymptotically stable, since in this case condition (2) of Theorem 1.5,
Chap. 1, on global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium (0, 0, 0) of the generalized
Lorenz system is satisﬁed. Consequently, if τ1(ς) < κ, then the proof is complete.
Suppose that τ1(ς) ≥κ and choose ς1 > ς so large that τ1(ς1) < κ. It is clear
that (5.76) is convergent if h2 ∈Z, where

stability of the equilibrium (0, 0, 0) of system (5.76). From Theorem 5.12 the con-

Estimates of Fractal Dimension
5.4.1
Maps with a Constant Jacobian
In this subsection we derive for a class of differentiable maps in Rn an upper estimate
of the fractal dimension of an invariant set. Our representation in Sects.5.4.1 and
5.4.2 is based on the results of [13, 14].
Let us recall that, in various kinds of applications, for chaotic attractors, their frac-
tal dimension is of higher signiﬁcance than their Hausdorff dimension. One exam-
ple are embedding strategies for dynamical systems with a high-dimensional phase
space, which answers the question how many degrees of freedom for a model system
are sufﬁcient to represent the essential dynamics faithfully. If for such a system, we
have given an attractor of fractal dimension d, Sauer, Yorke and Casdagli [39] show
that in “almost all cases” it can be mapped injectively via a linear transformation
into Rn provided n > 2d. A counterexample by I. Kan in the appendix of [39] points
out that the fractal dimension may not be replaced by the Hausdorff dimension. (See
also Remark 3.7, Chap. 3.) Another example are noisy systems where the volume of
the attractor scales with the magnitude of the noise, with a scaling factor depending
on the fractal dimension of the noiseless attractor [33].

Let
ϕ : Rn →Rn
(5.78)
be a continuously differentiable map. Suppose that the compact set K ⊂Rn is an
invariant set for ϕ, i.e. ϕ(K) = K.
Denote by α1(u) ≥· · · ≥αn(u) the singular values of the differential Dϕ(u) of
the map ϕ at u.
Theorem 5.17 Suppose that
α1(u) · · · αn(u) ≡const ̸= 0,

Then dimF K ≤n −1 + s.
Remark 5.5 Conditions analogous to (5.79) are considered in [14] for invertible
maps as the Hénon system. In contrast to the results in this section the fractal dimen-
sion estimates in [14] are given in terms of Lyapunov exponents and without use of
a “regulating function” κ. In the following we call (5.79) Chen’s condition [14] for
maps. It will be shown in Sect. 8.2, Chap.8 that the fractal dimension estimate (5.80)
is true under more general assumptions.
Before we come to the proof of Theorem 5.17 let us formulate and prove several
auxiliary results.
Let us introduce the notation
ς := min
u∈K αn(u),
ωn(u) := α1(u) · · · αn(u), u ∈Rn .
(5.81)
Since by (5.79) the quantity ωn(u) is constant on K, we put for u ∈K
ωn := ωn(u).
(5.82)
Lemma 5.6 Consider the compact invariant set K of the map (5.78) and the numbers
ς and ωn deﬁned in (5.81) and (5.82), respectively.
Suppose that ς < (√n)−1 and d > 0 is a number such that
ωnςd−n ≤4−nn−d/2.
(5.83)
Then dimF K ≤d.

Proof Take an η ∈(0, ς). Let r0 > 0 be so small that


ϕ(υ) −ϕ(u) −Dϕ(u)(υ −u)


 ≤η|υ −u|,
∀u, υ ∈K, |u −υ| < r0.
(5.84)
Let us ﬁx an arbitrary r ∈(0, r0). By the compactness and invariance of K points
u j ∈K, j = 1, . . . , NK(r), can be found such that
K =

Now put σ := √n ς. From (5.85), (5.86) we have
Nσr(K) ≤Nr(K) max
j
Nσr(rE′
j).
(5.87)
Since ς ≤αn(u j) = αn(E j) < αn(E′
j), by Lemma 2.3, Chap. 2, we have
Nσr(rE′
j) ≤2nωn(rE′
j)(rς)−n = 2nωn(E′
j)ς−n ≤2n(1 + η/ς)nωn(E j)ς−n
≤4nωn(u j)ς−n = 4nωnς−n.
(5.88)
From the previous inequality, inequalities (5.87) and (5.83 ) we obtain
Nσr(K) ≤Nr(K)4nωnς−n+dnd/2σ −d ≤σ −d Nr(K).
(5.89)
Since σ < 1, we can ﬁnd for ε ∈(0, r0) an integer number l ≥0 such that σ l+1r0 ≤
ε < σ lr0. Consequently, applying l times inequality (5.88), we have
Nε(K) ≤σ −ld Nσ −lε(K) ≤

(5.91)
ς < (√n)−1.
(5.92)
In the opposite case, taking into account Lemma 5.7, we can use for the dimension
estimation of K the map ϕm instead of the map ϕ.
According to Lemma 5.6 for the proof of the theorem it is sufﬁcient to check the
inequality
ωnςs−1 ≤c.
Let u0 ∈K be such that αn(u0) = ς. Then, by (5.89) we obtain

Remark 5.6 In analogy with (5.79) we call (5.94) Chen’s condition [14] for differ-

Fractal Dimension Estimates for Invariant Sets and
Attractors of Concrete Systems
In this section we will estimate with the help of Lyapunov functions the fractal
dimension of invariant sets or attractors of the following concrete systems: Rössler’s
system, the Lorenz system, equations of the third order and a system describing the
interaction of waves in plasma.
All these systems can be considered in R3 and satisfy Chen’s condition. Therefore,
in order to ﬁnd upper fractal dimension estimates, we can use Corollary 5.12, and
the main goal is to verify the inequality
λ1(x, y, z) + λ2(x, y, z) + sλ3(x, y, z) + ˙V (x, y, z) < 0,
∀(x, y, z) ∈K ,
(5.95)
where λ1(x, y, z) ≥λ2(x, y, z) ≥λ3(x, y, z) are the eigenvalues of the symmetrized
Jacobian matrix of the right side of the system at the point (x, y, z), s is some number
from the interval [0, 1], and ˙V (x, y, z) is the derivative of a certain continuously
differentiable function V with respect to the system at a point (x, y, z) ∈K.
5.5.1
The Rössler System
Let us consider the Rössler system [38]
dx
dt = −y −z,
dy
dt = x,
dz
dt = −bz + a(y −y2),
(5.96)
where a and b are positive parameters. Computer simulation shows that for certain
positive values of these parameters system (5.96) has a compact invariant set K with
non-integer fractal dimension.
The following theorem is due to [31].
Theorem 5.19 Let K ⊂R3 be a compact and invariant set of system (5.96). Then
dimF K ≤3 −

Consequently, condition (5.95) with respect to a Lyapunov function V and a param-

−(1 + s)b + (1 −s)

b2 + 1 + a2(1 −2y)2 + 2 ˙V < 0, ∀t ∈R .
(5.98)
Let us choose the function V as
V (x, z) := 1
2(1 −s)κ(z −bx),
where κ is a varying parameter. A direct calculation shows that
˙V = 1

and inequality (5.98) is equivalent to
−(1 + s)b + (1 −s)h(y; κ) < 0,

(5.99)
where
h(y; κ) =

Let us put

(a + 2b)2 + b2 + 1

we receive the inequality
h(y; κ) ≤

y ∈R .
The previous estimate shows that (5.100) implies (5.97).
□
Example 5.2 For a = 0.386 and b = 0.2 numerically was obtained [38] a chaotic
invariant set K in (5.96). From estimate (5.97) we obtain for this set dimF K ≤2.731.

Lorenz Equation
Consider again the Lorenz system
˙x = −σ x + σ y,
˙y = rx −y −xz,
˙z = −bz + xy.
(5.101)
Recall that σ, b, r are positive parameters. Firstly we shall get a fractal dimension
estimate for an arbitrary attractor of system (5.101) without use of a Lyapunov
function V , i.e. in inequality (5.95) ˙V will be identically equal to zero. Consider the
following cubic equation
ζ 3 + a1ζ 2 + a2ζ + a3 = 0

with coefﬁcients

Denote by ζ0 the maximal real root of equation (5.102) and put
k := inf
ς max {σ + b + 1, b + ς2r(b −1)/σ, ζ0}.
The next theorem and Corollary 5.15 are obtained in [7].
Theorem 5.20 Let A be an attractor of system (5.101). Suppose that b > 1. Then
dimF A ≤3 −(σ + b + 1)/k.
Proof By the change of variables (x, y, z) →(ςx, y, z) we can transform system
(5.101) into the form
˙x = −σ(x −ς−1y),
˙y = (r −z)ςx −y,
˙z = −bz + ςxy.
(5.104)
Recall that system (5.101) is dissipative with a dissipativity domain U0 satisfying

D1 ∩{z| z ≥0}

,
where
D1 := {y, z | y2 + (z −r)2 < l2r2}.
Let us take an arbitrary number w satisfying the inequality
w > max {σ + b + 1, b + ς2r(b −1)/σ, ζ0}.
(5.105)
Denote by J(y, z) the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of system (5.104). It is

is positive deﬁnite in U0, since in this case Corollary 5.4 with V (x, y, z) ≡const
gives the estimate dimF K < d. Here d is an arbitrary non-negative number satisfying
the inequality (3 −d)ζ −(σ + b + 1) < 0. The previous inequality is equivalent to
d > 3 −(σ + b + 1)/ζ. Whence, by (5.105), the proof of the theorem is completed.
In order to prove the positive deﬁniteness, it is sufﬁcient, by virtue of the Sylvester
criterion and the choice of w, to verify that
ψ(y, z) := det
1
2(J(y, z)∗+ J(y, z)) + ζ I

> 0,
when (y, z) ∈D1. But for (y, z) ∈D1 we have
ψ(y, z) ≥(ζ −σ)(ζ −1)(ζ −b) −1

.
(5.106)
Since ζ > b + ς2r(b −1)/σ and z ≥0, we see that the expression in square
brackets attains its minimum for z = 0. Taking this fact into account and also the
form of coefﬁcients of equation (5.102), we obtain
ψ(y, z) ≥ζ 3 + a1ζ 2 + a2ζ + a3.
Consequently, by virtue of the choice of w, ψ(y, z) > 0 in D1.
□
Example 5.3 For values of parameters σ = 10, b = 8/3,r = 28 Theorem 5.20 with
ς = 0.6 gives for an attractor A of (5.101) the estimate dimF A < 2.405 . . . .
Corollary 5.13 Let A be an attractor of system (5.101). Suppose, 1 < b ≤2. Then
dimF A ≤3 −

(5.107)
Proof Without loss of generality we can assume that the inequality
r ≥(b + 1)(b/σ + 1)
(5.108)
is satisﬁed, since in the case of validity of the opposite inequality system (5.101) is
gradient-like by Corollary 5.10.
According to hypothesis b ≤2, we have l = 1 and equation (5.102) can be written
in the form
(ζ −b)

ζ 2 −(σ + 1)ζ + σ −(ςr + σ/ς)2
= 0.
(5.109)
Let us show that for ς := √σ/r the number

is the maximum root of equation (5.102). This follows from the inequality
ζ0 ≥σ + b + 1
(5.110)
which is equivalent to

(σ −1)2 + 4σr ≥2b + σ + 1 .
The previous inequality is equivalent to hypothesis (5.108).
From (5.102) it follows also that for ς = √σ/r we have
ζ0 > b + ς2r(b −1)/σ = 2b −1,
since σ + b + 1 > 2b −1 for b ≤2. Thus, by virtue of Theorem 5.20
dimF K ≤3 −(σ + b + 1)/ζ0.
□
The region of parameters for which the simpler estimate, given by Corollary 5.13
is true, does not include Lorenz’s values of parameters (σ = 10, b = 8/3,r = 28).
The following theorem [31, 32] which is proved with the use of a Lyapunov
function V (x, y, z) ̸≡const shows the validity of the estimate (5.107) in another
domain of parameters that includes in particular the Lorenz’s values of parameters.
Theorem 5.21 Let A be an attractor of system (5.101) and assume that b > 1 and
the inequalities
σ + 1 −2b ≥0,
σ 2r(4 −b) + 2σ(b −1)(2σ −3b) −b(b −1)2 ≥0
(5.111)
hold. Then the estimate (5.107) is true.
Proof By the linear change of variables
(x, y, z) →(ςx, ς(b −1)

where ς > 0 is a varying parameter, system (5.101) takes the form

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Dynamical Systems
Taking into account the ﬁrst of inequalities (5.111), we conclude that Δ < 0 and,
consequently, system (5.119) is uniquely solvable with respect to τ1 and τ2.
Since by the hypothesis of the theorem b > 1, we have
ς2 < 2τ2 ,
(5.119)
A2 ≤0 and A3 ≤0. From (5.119) it follows that
τ2 =


2b(σ + 1) −(σ 2r + 2σ + b2 + 1)

(5.120)
Substituting into (5.119) the values of τ2 and τ3 deﬁned by equalities (5.120) and
(5.118), respectively, we obtain the condition
σ 2r(2 −b) + 2σ(b −1)(σ −2b) −b(b −1) −2σ 3
ς2 ≥0.
(5.121)
Thus, we have seen that if inequality (5.121) holds, then we can choose the
parameters τ1, τ2, τ3 such that inequality (5.117) is satisﬁed.
Supposing that (5.121) is valid we change inequality (5.116) to
−(σ + 1 + 2b) −(σ + 1)s + 1 −s
4τ 2 + (1 −s)τ 2P0 < 0.
Deﬁning τ 2 := 1
2(P0)−1/2 we rewrite the last inequality in the form
−(σ + 1 + 2b) −(σ + 1)s + (1 −s)

P0 < 0.
For
ς := σ/

σr + (b −1)(σ −b)
(5.122)
we have
−(σ + 1 + 2b) −(σ + 1)s + (1 −s)

(σ −1)2 + 4σr < 0,
which is true if
s > 1 −
2(σ + b + 1)
σ + 1 +

(σ −1)2 + 4σr
.
Whence it follows that estimate (5.107) holds, since condition (5.121) for ς deﬁned
by equality (5.122) coincides with the second of inequalities (5.111).
□
Example 5.4 Let A be an attractor of the Lorenz system (5.101) for σ = 10,
b = 8/3, r = 28. For these parameters the inequalities (5.111) are satisﬁed and the
estimate (5.107) gives dimF A < 2.401 . . . .

5.5 Fractal Dimension Estimates for Invariant Sets and Attractors of Concrete Systems

Using Corollary 5.12 and the proof of the previous theorem, we can obtain the
following result.
Theorem 5.22 Let inequality (5.111) be satisﬁed. If
r < (b + 1)(b/σ + 1),
(5.123)
then each positive semi-orbit of system (5.101) converges to an equilibrium.
Example 5.5 For σ = 10, b = 8/3 condition (5.123) guarantees the convergence
of all positive semi-orbits of the Lorenz system for r < 4.64.
We recall that for b ≤2 condition (5.123) was proved in Sect. 3.4, Chap. 3.
5.5.3
Equations of the Third Order
In this subsection we will derive an upper fractal dimension estimate for the compact
sets, which are invariant with respect to the ﬂow, generated by the equation
...x + a ¨x + b ˙x + f (x) = 0 ,
(5.124)
where a, b are positive numbers and f : R →R is a continuously differentiable
function. Assume for this that for any p = (p1, p2, p3) ∈R3 the solution x(·, p) of
(5.124) satisfying x(0, p) = p1, ˙x(0, p) = p2, ¨x(0, p) = p3, exists on R. Deﬁne by
ϕt(p) := (x(t, p), ˙x(t, p), ¨x(t, p)),
t ∈R, p ∈R3 ,
the ﬂow in R3 generated by (5.124).
The deduction of the estimate is based on Corollary 5.12 and on the construction
of a Lyapunov function of the form “quadratic + linear forms”. The introduction
of functions of this kind makes it possible to obtain dimension estimates without
localization of attractors in the three-dimensional phase space of the associated ﬂow.
All results of Sect.5.5.3 are due to [6].

Theorem 5.23 Suppose that K is a compact set which is invariant with respect to

h(x; κ1, κ2) is true.
Proof Let us make in (5.124) a change of the time variable by t →b−1/2t and rewrite
the equation in the form
...x + a1 ¨x + ˙x + f1(x) = 0,
(5.126)
where a1 := ab−1/2, and f1(x) := b−3/2 f (x). If we put y = ˙x, z = −x −¨x the
Eq.(5.126) will be transformed to the system
˙x = y,
˙y = −x −z,
˙z = −a1x −a1z + f1(x).
(5.127)
(Note that this transformation, different to the standard one, does not change the
fractal dimension of the associated invariant sets.) The symmetrized Jacobian matrix

Let us illustrate the use of Theorem 5.17 by some examples.
(a) Equations with a quadratic nonlinearity: Consider Eq.(5.124) with f (x) :=
cx −dx2, i.e.
...x + a ¨x + b ˙x + cx −dx2 = 0 ,
(5.128)
where c, d are real non-zero parameters.

ﬂow generated by equation (5.128). Then we have

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Dynamical Systems
Since we have in this case the inequality
h ≤

a2 + b + (ab + |c|)2/b2 ,
the estimate (5.129) follows by Theorem 5.23.
□
Example 5.6 For the values a = 0.1, b = 1, c = d = −0.58 which are considered
in numerical simulations, the estimate (5.129) gives dimF K < 2.848.
It is obvious that the system
˙x = y −ax,
˙y = z −bx,
˙z = −cx + dx2,
(5.130)
can be transformed to an Eq.(5.128). This system is used in [20] for the simulation
of the propagation of excitations in nerve ﬁbers. The study of (5.130) by numerical
simulation in [20] shows the existence of a strange attractor in a certain part of
the parameter space. In particular, a strange attractor of system (5.130) was found
for a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.5, d = 2. In this case we obtain from (5.129) the estimate
dimF K < 2.530.
The Rössler system (5.96), i.e.
˙x = −y −z,
˙y = x,
˙z = −βz + α(y −y2),
(5.131)
where α and β are positive parameters can also be reduced to an equation of the form
(5.128). Differentiating the second equation of this system twice and using now the
other two equations, we obtain the third order equation
...y + β ¨y + ˙y + (α + β)y −αy2 = 0 .
(5.132)
From Theorem 5.24 it follows now that for any compact set K which is invariant
with respect to the ﬂow generated by equation (5.132)
dimF K ≤3 −2β/

β +

β2 + 1 + (α + 2β)2 

(b) Equations with a cubic nonlinearity: Consider Eq.(5.128) with f (x) = cx −
dx3, where c, d are positive constants, i.e.
...x + a ¨x + b ˙x + cx −dx3 = 0.
(5.133)
Theorem 5.25 Let K be a compact set which is invariant with respect to the ﬂow
generated by equation (5.133). Then the estimate
dimF K ≤3 −2a/

a +

a2 + b + (ab + 2c)2/b2 
is true.

5.5 Fractal Dimension Estimates for Invariant Sets and Attractors of Concrete Systems
243
Proof The proof is analogous to the proof of the previous theorem if we take the
function h with κ2 = 0.
□
Example 5.7 For the values of parameters a = 1, b = 3.5, c = 9.6, d = 1 in the
paper [1, 3] it was stated by numerical integration, that a strange attractor for the
ﬂow, generated by equation (5.133), exists. If follows from Theorem 5.25 that its
fractal dimension is not greater than 2.745.
Remark 5.7 Let us remark that in contrast to the case of a quadratic nonlinearity
we obtained in Theorem 5.25 the dimension estimate only for d > 0. This constraint
is due to our method. There are examples [3, 15], which show that for d < 0 the
ﬂow, generated by equation (5.131) has a strange attractor. The condition c > 0 is
not really a constraint, since for c < ab and d > 0 equation (5.133) has no compact
invariant sets different from the equilibrium states. This follows from the next result.
Lemma 5.8 Suppose that the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R, generated by equation (5.124), has only
isolated equilibrium states. Then each bounded positive semi-orbit of a motion t →
ϕt(p) = (x(t, p), ˙x(t, p), ¨x(t, p)) which satisﬁes one of the conditions

tends to an equilibrium state.
Proof Analogously to the proof of Theorem 5.23 let us consider equation (5.126)
instead of equation (5.124). Assuming y = ˙x, z = a1 ˙x + ¨x, f1(x) = b−3/2 f (x), we
can write (5.126) in the form of the following system
˙x = y,
˙y = −a1y + z,
˙z = −y −f1(x) .
(5.134)
Suppose that condition (1) is satisﬁed and consider the function
V (x, y, z) := 1
2 (y2 + z2) + y f1(x) + a1

f1(ζ) d ζ.

(5.135)
Therefore, if we denote by u(t, u0) =

x(t, u0), y(t, u0), z(t, u0)

that solution of
system (5.134) which corresponds to the bounded solution ϕt(p), then the func-
tion V

u(t, u0)

does not increase in t on some interval (τ, ∞). From this and
from the boundedness of V

u(t, u0)

it follows that there exists the ﬁnite limit
limt→+∞V

u(t, u0)

= l. From the boundedness of the orbit u(t, u0) on (0, ∞) it
follows that the set ω(u0) of its ω-limit points is not empty. Let q ∈ω(u0) be arbitrary
and let u(t, q) = (x(t, q), y(t, q), z(t, q)) be the solution of (5.134) passing through
q. By Proposition 1.4, Chap. 1, u(t, q) ∈ω(u0) ∀t ∈R. Therefore V

But then, using (5.135), we obtain the identity y(t, q) ≡0. Taking this into account,
we get from the second equation (5.134) z(t, q) ≡0 and from the ﬁrst equation
x(t, q) ≡const. Consequently, all points of ω(u0) are equilibrium states. Since the
equilibriumstatesaresupposedtobeisolated,Lemma5.8isprovedundertheassump-
tion that condition (1) is satisﬁed.
In the case that condition (2) is satisﬁed the proof of the lemma is analogous if
we use instead of V the function −V .

5.5.4
Equations Describing the Interaction Between Waves in
Plasma
We have shown above that the introduction of a Lyapunov function V in the estimates
of dimension makes it possible to obtain a result without localization of attractors in
the phase space. But if a system is dissipative and for the estimation of its domain of
dissipation some Lyapunov function V is used, then the same function V or, more
generally, a function ψ(V ), where ψ is some continuously differentiable function,
may be used as V . The example considered in the present subsection illustrates this
situation.
Let us return to Rabinovich’s system (5.76) describing the interaction of waves
in plasma
˙x = hy −x −yz,
˙y = hx −ωy + xz,
˙z = −z + xy,
(5.136)
where h, ω are positive numbers. In Sect.5.3.4, considering (5.136) in the frames
of the generalized Lorenz system, we obtained a sufﬁcient condition for gradient
ﬂow-like behaviour of this system. Further, this result will be improved. Besides, the
following estimate of attractor dimension [7] of system (5.136) will be obtained.
Theorem 5.26 Let A be an attractor of system (5.136). Then
dimF A ≤3 −

(5.137)
with k1 = (13

Proof Let us make the change of variables in (5.136) by (x, y, z) →(x, ςy, z),
where ς ̸= 0 is a varying parameter. In the new variable system (5.136) takes the
form
˙x = ςhy −x −ςyz,
˙y = h
ς x −ωy + 1
ς xz,
˙z = −z + ςxy.

In order to exclude the square root let us consider the inequality

P ≤τ 2P +

4τ 2 ,
(5.140)
where τ ̸= 0 is a varying parameter.
From the results of Sect. 1.4, Chap. 1, it follows that: (1) system (5.138) is dis-
sipative, i.e. in the phase space there is an ellipsoid E(ς) such that any trajectory of
the system arrives to it in a ﬁnite time and further remains there; 2) as a dissipativity
domain one can choose also the more “narrow” set G0, given by
G0 := E(ς) ∩
&
x, z| V1(x, z) ≤h2'
,
where V1(x, z) := x2 + (z −h)2. We choose a Lyapunov function V in the form
V (x, z) := 1
2(1 −s)τ 2κV1(x, z),
where κ is a varying parameter. Then, taking into account (5.140), we can conclude
that inequality (5.139) will be satisﬁed if
−(ω + 3) −(ω + 1)s + 1 −s
4τ 2 + (1 −s)τ 2(P + κ ˙V1) < 0.

Further, 2A + C = 4(1/ς2 + 1) −κ. Choose now
κ := 4(1/ς2 + 1)τ,
where τ is a new varying parameter. Then φ ≤(1 −τ)2(1/ς2 + 1)2h2.

Recall [34] that for ω = 4, h = 4.92 system (5.136) has a strange attractor A.
Theorem 5.26 gives the estimate dimF A < 2.246.

Proof For the proof of this theorem [7] we can use Corollary 5.9. Using the proof
of the previous theorem with s = 0, we get inequality (5.144), which is equivalent
to condition (5.146) if the varying parameters is the same as in the proof of Theorem
5.26.

bounded on an interval [0, t0] which implies that they are bounded on any interval
[0, t]. Let
ν(t) := inf{ν ∈R+ | ρ(ϕt(p), ϕt(q)) ≤νρ(p, q), ∀p, q ∈M}.
Since ρ(ϕt1+t2(p), ϕt1+t2(q)) ≤ν(t1)ν(t2)ρ(p, q) we get ν(t1 + t2) ≤ν(t1)ν(t2) for

Now we can deduce from Theorem 5.28 with ρ(p, q) ≡1, ρ′(p, q) ≡ρ(p, q) and
ϕ = ϕ1 the following inequality obtained in [19].
Corollary 5.14 The topological entropy of ϕ1 on M satisﬁes
htop(ϕ1, M) ≤max{0, ν} dimF M .
(5.157)
Proof It is clear that k j ≤ν( j). Hence, k ≤[ν( j)]1/j or, equivalently, log k ≤
1
j log ν( j). Setting j →∞, we ﬁnd that log k ≤ν. The validity of (5.157) follows
now from (5.151).
□
Using the notion of lower box dimension we now derive a result which sharpens
the estimate (5.151).
Theorem 5.29 Consider the map (5.147). Suppose that for k, deﬁned by (5.150),
we have k < ∞and let dimBM < ∞. Then
htop(ϕ, M) ≤max{0, log k}dimBM .
(5.158)
Proof The proof is similar to the one of the previous theorem. But instead of the
Bowen-Dinaburg deﬁnition of topological entropy we will use the characterization

5.6 Estimates of the Topological Entropy

of the topological entropy by open covers. Let U be an open cover of M. Then there
exists an ε > 0 such that
N (U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) ≤Nε(M, m)
(5.159)
(see the Proof of Proposition 3.27, Chap. 3, inequality 3.17).
Decreasing ε, if necessary, we can assume that ε from (5.159) is such that (5.152)
is valid. Consider again separately the two cases k ≥1 and k < 1.
Case k ≥1: By the same way as above we obtain the inequality Nε(M, m) ≤
Nδ(M) with δ = κ−(m+l)

m log N (U ∨ϕ−1U ∨· · · ∨ϕ−(m−1)U) ≤log Nδ(M)

(5.160)
Since for a decreasing function ψ : R+ →R+, θ ∈(0, 1) and ε0 > 0 the equality
lim inf
ε→0
log ψ(ε)
−log ε = lim inf
m→∞
log ψ(θmε0)
−log(θmε0)
is satisﬁed ([22], Lemma 6.2) we get
dimBM = lim inf
m→∞
log Nδm(M)

(5.161)
where δm := θmε0, θ := 1/κ j0 and ε0 := κ−l

dimBM. Due to (5.161) there exists a subsequence m′ →∞such that for all sufﬁ-
ciently large m′
log Nδm ′(M)
log δ−1
m′
< ς .
(5.162)
Setting in (5.160) m = m′ →∞and taking into account that for the left-hand side
there exists the limit (see Sect. 3.3, Chap. 3), we obtain
h(ϕ, U) < ς log κ j0 .
Since the cover U, numbers ς and κ = κ j0 where arbitrary we have proved (5.158)
for k ≥1.
Case k < 1: As in the proof of Theorem 5.28 we have Nε(M, m) ≤Nδ(M) with
δ := κl
j0ε.
Consequently, (5.160) is valid. Since δ now does not depend on m, we let m →
+∞in (5.160) and ﬁnd that h(ϕ, U) ≤0.
□
Remark 5.8 The estimate (5.158) involves for ρ(p, q) ≡1, k = k1 and ρ′(p, q) ≡
ρ(p, q) the related result in [22, 28]. A generalization of this result is given in [2].

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Dynamical Systems
5.6.2
Application to Differential Equations
We apply now Theorem 5.28 to the differential equation
dϕ
dt = f (ϕ),
(5.163)
where f : Rn →Rn is a continuously differentiable function such that the ﬂow
{ϕt}t∈R of (5.163) exists. Let
λ1(p) ≥λ2(p) ≥· · · ≥λn(p)
be the eigenvalues of its symmetrized Jacobian matrix 1
2[Df (p) + Df (p)∗] at the
point p ∈Rn. For a continuously differentiable function V : U →R (U ⊂Rn an
open set) we shall use as above the notation ˙V (p) := ( f (p), grad V (p)).
Suppose that (5.163) has an invariant compact convex set K ⊂Rn. Recall that the
invariance means that the equality K = ϕt(K) holds for all t ∈R.
According to the deﬁnition of topological entropy of a dynamical system, the
topological entropy of system (5.163) with respect to K is the entropy of the operator
ϕ1 acting on K. Let us denote it by htop(ϕ1, K).
To estimate the asymptotic Lipschitz constant k entering in the estimate given
by Theorem 5.28, we use logarithmic norms. Besides, we replace the “regulating”
function κ, which is used in the deﬁnition of k j, by a Lyapunov function.
Theorem 5.30 Let Λ be some logarithmic norm in Mn(R) and V : U →R be a
function which is continuously differentiable on a neighborhood U of K. Then the
estimate
htop(ϕ1, K) ≤max{0,k} dimF K
is true, where the constant k is deﬁned by
k := max
p∈K
&
Λ(Df (p)) + ˙V (p)
'
.
Proof By virtue of Theorem 5.28 it is sufﬁcient to show that for any ς > 0 the
inequality k1 < exp(k + ς) is true, where k1 is deﬁned by (5.149). For this purpose
it is sufﬁcient to check that for all ς > 0 a number ε > 0 can be found such that with
ϕ ≡ϕ1

Chapter 6
Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical
Systems in Euclidean Spaces
Abstract Nowadays there is a number of surveys and theoretical works devoted to
Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension, however most of them are devoted
to inﬁnite dimensional systems or rely on special ergodic properties of a system. At
the same time the provided illustrative examples are often ﬁnite dimensional sys-
tems and the rigorous proof of their ergodic properties can be a difﬁcult task. Also
the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension have become so widespread and
common that they are often used without references to the rigorous deﬁnitions or pio-
neering works. This chapter is devoted to the ﬁnite dimensional dynamical systems
in Euclidean space and its aim is to explain, in a simple but rigorous way, the connec-
tion between the key works in the area: Kaplan and Yorke (the concept of Lyapunov
dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterlé (estimation of Hausdorff dimension via the
Lyapunov dimension of maps, 1980), Constantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (estima-
tion of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension
of dynamical systems, 1985–90), Leonov (estimation of the Lyapunov dimension
via the direct Lyapunov method, 1991), and numerical methods for the computation
of Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension. In this chapter a concise overview
of the classical results is presented, various deﬁnitions of Lyapunov exponents and
Lyapunov dimension are discussed. An effective analytical method for the estimation
of the Lyapunov dimension is presented, its application to self-excited and hidden
attractors of well-known dynamical systems is demonstrated, and analytical formulas
of exact Lyapunov dimension are obtained.

Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Spaces
where f : U ⊂Rn →Rn is a continuously differentiable vector-function. Suppose
that any solution u(t, p) of (6.1) such that u(0, p) = p ∈U exists for t ∈[0, ∞), is
unique, and stays in U. Then the evolutionary operator ϕt(p) := u(t, p) is continu-
ously differentiable and satisﬁes the semigroup property
ϕt+s(p) = ϕt(ϕs(p)), ϕ0(p) = p
∀t, s ≥0, ∀p ∈U.
(6.2)
Thus {ϕt}t≥0 is a smooth dynamical system in the phase space (U, | · |):

{ϕt}t≥0,
(U ⊂Rn, | · |)

. Here |u| =

u2
1 + · · · + u2n is the Euclidean norm of the vector
u = (u1, . . . , un) ∈Rn. Similarly, we can consider a dynamical system generated
by the difference equation
ut+1 = ϕ(ut),
t = 0, 1, .. ,
(6.3)
where ϕ : U ⊂Rn →U is a continuously differentiable vector-function. Here
ϕt(u) = (ϕ ◦ϕ ◦· · · ϕ)



t−times
(u), ϕ0(u) = u, and the existence and uniqueness (in the
forward-time direction) take place for all t ≥0. Further {ϕt}t≥0 denotes a smooth
dynamical system with continuous or discrete time.
Consider the linearizations of systems (6.1) and (6.3) along the solution ϕt(u)
˙υ = J(ϕt(u))υ,
J(u) = Df (u),
(6.4)
υt+1 = J(ϕt(u))υt,
J(u) = Dϕ(u),
(6.5)
where J(u) is the n × n Jacobian matrix, all elements of which are continuous
functions of u. Consider the fundamental matrix
Dϕt(u) =

υ1(t), ..., υn(t)

,
Dϕ0(u) = I,
(6.6)
which consists of linearly independent solutions {υi(t)}n
i=1 of the linearized system.
An important cocycle property of the fundamental matrix (6.6) is
Dϕt+s(u) = Dϕt
ϕs(u)

Dϕs(u), ∀t, s ≥0, ∀u ∈U ⊂Rn.
(6.7)
Consider the singular values of the matrix Dϕt(u) sorted by descending for each
t ∈[0, +∞) and u ∈U ⊂Rn:
αi(t, u) := αi(Dϕt(u)), α1(t, u) ≥... ≥αn(t, u) ≥0,
∀t ≥0, u ∈U ⊂Rn.
(6.8)
Similar to Chap. 2, we introduce the singular value function of Dϕt(u) of order d
by ωd(Dϕt(u)).
For a ﬁxed t ≥0 one can consider the map deﬁned by the evolutionary operator
ϕt : U ⊂Rn →U.
Further we need the following auxiliary statements.

6.1 Singular Value Function and Invariant Sets of Maps of Dynamical Systems
259
Lemma 6.1 From formula (2.4), Chap. 2 it follows that for any u ∈U and t ≥0
the function d 	→ωd(Dϕt(u)) is a left-continuous function.
Lemma 6.2 For any d ∈[0, n] and t ≥0 the function u 	→ωd(Dϕt(u)) is contin-
uous on U (see, e.g. [30]). Therefore for a compact set K ⊂U and t ≥0 we have
sup
u∈K
ωd(Dϕt(u)) = max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)).
(6.9)
Proof It follows from the continuity of the functions u 	→αi(Dϕ(u)) i = 1, 2, ..., n
on U.
□
Next, unless otherwise stated, the invariance of the set K ⊂U ⊂Rn is considered
with respect to the dynamical system

{ϕt}t≥0, (U ⊂Rn, | · |)

: ϕt(K)=K, ∀t ≥0.
Lemma 6.3 For a compact invariant set K and any d ∈[0, n], the function t 	→
max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) is sub-exponential, i.e.,
max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt+s(u)) ≤max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) max
u∈K ωd(Dϕs(u)),
∀t, s ≥0;
(6.10)
If maxu∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) > 0 for t ≥0, then log maxu∈K ωd(Dϕt+s(u)) is subadditive,
i.e.,
log max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt+s(u)) ≤log max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) + log max
u∈K ωd(Dϕs(u)).
Proof By (6.7) and (6.2)
max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt+s(u)) = max
u∈K

ωd(Dϕt(ϕs(u))Dϕs(u))

≤max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(ϕs(u))) max
u∈K ωd(Dϕs(u)) ≤max

u∈K ωd(Dϕs(u)).

1Considering additional properties of the dynamical system and the singular value function, one
could get limt→+∞instead of lim inft→+∞, but we do not need it for our further consideration.

Proof Let inft>0 max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = M < 1. There are δ > 0 and t0 = t0(δ) such
that max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt0(u)) ≤1 −δ. Thus by (6.10) we have for u ∈K and n ≥0
0 ≤ωd(Dϕnt0(u)) ≤max
u∈K ωd(Dϕnt0(u)) ≤(max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt0(u)))n ≤(1 −δ)n →n→+∞0
and therefore M = lim infn→+∞ωd(Dϕnt0(u)) = lim inft→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = 0.
The same is true if we consider lim inft→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 1 ﬁrst.

For a compact set K, t > 0, u ∈K, and d ∈[0, n] we consider two scalar functions
gd(t, u) and fd(t, u). Suppose that g0(t, u) = f0(t, u) ≡c, therefore the following
expressions
d+
g (t, u) = sup{d ∈[0, n] : gd(t, u) ≥c},
d+
f (t, u) = sup{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) ≥c}
are well deﬁned. Also we consider
d−
g (t, u) = inf{d ∈[0, n] : gd(t, u) < c},
d−
f (t, u) = inf{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) < c}.

the inﬁmum is equal to n. Deﬁne

Lemma 6.5 We have the following properties:
(P1) If for ﬁxed t > 0 and u ∈K the implication

inf{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) < c} ≤inf{d ∈[0, n] : gd(t, u) < c};
(6.15)
(P2) If for ﬁxed t > 0 and u ∈K the inequality
fd(t, u) ≤gd(t, u) holds
∀d ∈[0, n], then

(P3) If
sup{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) ≥c} = inf{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) < c},

(P4) If for ﬁxed t > 0 the equality
sup

fd(t, u) = max
u∈K fd(t, u) ∀d ∈[0, n]

(P5)
inf{d ∈[0, n] : inf

t>0 inf{d ∈[0, n] : fd(t, u) < c}. (6.22)
Proof (P1), (P2): Since in (P1) and (P2) the set of possible d, considered in the
left-hand side of the expression, involves the set of possible d, considered in the
right-hand side of the expression, we have the corresponding inequalities for the
inﬁmums of the sets. Similarly we get the relation for supremums.

6.2 Lyapunov Dimension of Maps
263
6.2
Lyapunov Dimension of Maps
The concept of the Lyapunov dimension had been suggested in the seminal paper by
Kaplan and Yorke [39] and later it was developed in a number of papers (see, e.g.
[15, 29]).
The following two deﬁnitions are inspirited by Douady-Oesterlé [22], see also
Chap. 5.
Deﬁnition 6.1 The (local) Lyapunov dimension3 of a continuously differentiable
map ϕ : U ⊂Rn →Rn at the point u ∈U is deﬁned as
dimL(ϕ, u) := sup{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1}.
For any u ∈U this value is well-deﬁned since ω0(Dϕ(u)) ≡1.
By Lemma 6.1 we get
dimL(ϕ, u) = max{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1}.
(6.26)
Additionally, since the singular values in (1) are ordered by decreasing, we have
dimL (ϕ, u) = max{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1} = inf{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1}
(6.27)
if the inﬁmum exists (i.e., there exists d ∈(0, n] such that ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1). Here
and further in the similar constructions if the inﬁmum does not exist, we assume that
the inﬁmum and considered dimension are taken equal to n.
Deﬁnition 6.2 The Lyapunov dimension of a (continuously differentiable) map
ϕ : U ⊂Rn →Rn of the compact set K ⊂U ⊂Rn is deﬁned as
dimL(ϕ, K) := sup
u∈K
dimL(ϕ, u) = sup
u∈K
sup{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1}.
Remark that by Lemma 6.5(property (6.19)) and Lemma 6.2 we have
dimL(ϕ, K) = sup
u∈K
sup{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1}
= sup{d ∈[0, n] : max
u∈K ωd(Dϕ(u)) ≥1}.
(6.28)
Additionally, by (6.27) and Lemma 6.5(property (6.21)), we have
3This is not a dimension in a rigorous sense (see, e.g. [35, 36, 43]).

264
6
Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Spaces
dimL(ϕ, K) = sup
u∈K
inf{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1}
= inf{d ∈[0, n] : max
u∈K ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1}
(6.29)
if the inﬁmum exists (i.e., there exists d ∈(0, n] such that max
u∈K ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1).
Theorem 6.2 (Douady-Oesterlé,[22];seealso[8, 94, 98],andChap.5)Ifthecontin-
uously differentiable map ϕ : U ⊂Rn →Rn has a negatively invariant or invariant
compact set K ⊂U, i.e.,
ϕ(K) ⊃K,
then
dimH K ≤dimL(ϕ, K).
Remark that under the assumptions of Theorem 6.2 if ωd(Dϕ(u)) < 1 for some
d ≤1, then dimH K = 0 (see, e.g. [98]). Thus, taking into account Lemma 6.2, we
have
Lemma 6.6 (see,e.g.[30])Thefunctionsu 	→dimL(ϕ, u)iscontinuousonU except
at a point u, which satisﬁes α1(Dϕ(u)) = 1, where it is still upper semi-continuous.
Corollary 6.6 By the Weierstrass extreme value theorem for upper semi-continuous
functions, there exists a critical point uL (it may be not unique) such that
sup
u∈K
dimL(ϕ, u) = max
u∈K dimL(ϕ, u) = dimL(ϕ, uL).
(6.30)
For an invariant compact set K of the dynamical system

{ϕt}t≥0, (U ⊂Rn, | · |)

one may consider for a ﬁxed t the evolutionary operator ϕt(u), then
ϕt(K) = K
and the corresponding Lyapunov dimension (ﬁnite time Lyapunov dimension)
dimL(ϕt, K) =
sup
u∈K
dimL(ϕt, u) = inf{d ∈[0, n] : max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 1}.
(6.31)
Example 6.1 Ifforanon-emptycompactsetK ⊂U ⊂Rn itisconsideredtheidenti-
cal map ϕ = id, then Dϕ(u) = I and by the deﬁnition of the Lyapunov dimension we
have dimL(id, K) = n. Remark that for t = 0 we have ϕ0 = id and dimL(ϕ0, K) = n,
thus we further consider t > 0.

6.2 Lyapunov Dimension of Maps
265
Remark 6.1 For the numerical estimations of dimension, the following remark is
important: for any t > 0 the equality (6.12) for a compact invariant set K implies the
existence of a s = s(t) > 0 such that
dimL(ϕt+s, K) ≤dimL(ϕt, K).
(6.32)
While in computations we can consider only a ﬁnite time t ≤T and the evolu-
tionary operator ϕT (u), from a theoretical point of view, it is interesting to study the
limit behavior of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 as t →+∞. Next, unless otherwise
stated, K ⊂U ⊂Rn denotes a compact invariant set with respect to the dynamical
system

{ϕt}t≥0, (U ⊂Rn, | · |)

: ϕt(K)=K, ∀t >0.
6.3
Lyapunov Dimensions of a Dynamical System
According to Deﬁnition 6.2 it is natural to give the following generalization for
dynamical systems.
Deﬁnition 6.3 ([44]) The Lyapunov dimension of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 with
respect to a compact invariant set K is deﬁned as
dimL ({ϕt}t≥0, K) := inf
t>0 dimL (ϕt, K) = inf
t>0 sup{d ∈[0, n] : max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) ≥1}.
(6.33)
By Theorem 6.2 we have
dimH K ≤dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) ≤dimL(ϕt, K).
(6.34)
By (6.31) and Lemma 6.5(property (6.22)) we have4
dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) = inf
t>0 dimL(ϕt, K) = inf{d ∈[0, n] : inf
t>0 max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 1}
(6.35)
and, ﬁnally, by (6.12) we have
dimL ({ϕt}t≥0, K) = inf
t>0 dimL (ϕt, K) = inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim inf
t→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = 0}.
(6.36)
4While inf and sup give the same values for ωd(Dϕt(u)) in (6.28) and (6.29), for
inft>0 max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) we need consider
sup{d ∈[0, n] : ∀
d ∈[0, d]
inft>0 max
u∈K ω
d(Dϕt(u)) ≥1} = inf{d ∈[0, n] : inft>0 max
u∈K ωd
(Dϕt(u)) < 1}..

Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Spaces
It is interesting to consider a critical point uL(T ) ∈K such that the supremum of
the local ﬁnite time Lyapunov dimension dimL(ϕT , u) is achieved at this point5
Proposition 6.1 Suppose that for a certain t = T > 0 the supremum of the local
ﬁnite time Lyapunov dimensions dimL(ϕT , u) is achieved at one of the equilibrium
points:
dimL(ϕT , ucr
eq) = sup
u∈K
dimL(ϕT , u),

eq ∈K.
(6.37)
Then
dimH K ≤dimL(ϕT , ucr
eq) = dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) = dimL(ϕT , K).
(6.38)
Proof From (6.11) we have
ωd(Dϕt(ucr
eq)) =

ωd(Dϕ(ucr
eq))
t,
∀t ≥0.
Therefore

ωd(DϕT (ucr
eq)) < 1

⇔

ωd(Dϕ(ucr
eq)) < 1

⇔

ωd(Dϕt(ucr
eq)) < 1, ∀t > 0

and

lim inf
t→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 1

⇒

lim inf
t→+∞ωd(Dϕt(ucr
eq)) < 1

⇔

ωd(DϕT (ucr
eq)) < 1

.
By Lemma 6.5(property (6.15)) we obtain
inf{d ∈[0, n] : ωd(DϕT (ucr
eq)) < 1} = dimL(ϕT , ucr
eq) ≤dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K).
Finally, by from (6.34) we get the assertion of the proposition.
□
Further, to consider log ωd(Dϕt(u)), we suppose that det J(u) ̸= 0 ∀u ∈U and
thus
αi(t, u) > 0,
i = 1, . . . , n.
(6.39)
5If there exists limt→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = 0 then it is interesting to study the existence
of a critical point u0 ∈K such that limt→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = lim supt→+∞ωd(Dϕt(u0)),
and to compare inf{d ∈[0, n] : sup
u∈K
lim supt→+∞ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 1} or sup
u∈K
lim supt→+∞sup{d ∈
[0, n] : ωd(Dϕt(u)) ≥1} with dimH K. Remark, it is clear that limt→+∞max
u∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) ≥
sup
u∈K
lim supt→+∞ωd(Dϕt(u)). From (6.30) it follows the existence of a critical point uL(t)
such that dimL (ϕt, uL(t)) = maxu∈K dimL (ϕt, u). Taking into account (6.32) we can con-
sider a sequence tk →+∞such that dimL (ϕtk , uL(tk)) is monotonically converging to
inft≥0 maxu∈K dimL (ϕt, u). Since K is a compact set, we can consider a subsequence tm = tkm →
+∞such that there exists a limit critical point ucr
L : uL(tm) →ucr
L ∈K as tm →+∞. Thus we
have dimL (ϕtm , uL(tm)) ↘dimL ({ϕt}t≥0, K) and uL(tm) →ucr
L ∈K as m →+∞.

6.3 Lyapunov Dimensions of a Dynamical System
267
The following deﬁnitions of Lyapunov dimension are inspirited by Constantin,
Foias, Temam [15], and Eden [25].6
Deﬁnition 6.4 The (global) Lyapunov dimension of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0
with respect to a compact invariant set K is deﬁned as7
dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K) := inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim
t→+∞max
u∈K
1
t log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0}. (6.40)
The correctness of the deﬁnition follows from (6.14).
By (6.39) we have

lim inf
t→+∞maxu∈K(ωd(Dϕt(u))) < 1 ⇔lim inf
t→+∞maxu∈K log(ωd(Dϕt(u))) < 0

t→+∞maxu∈K log(ωd(Dϕt(u))) < 0

.
Thus, taking into account (6.36) and (6.14), by Lemma 6.5(property (6.15)) we have
dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K)
= inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim inf
t→+∞max
u∈K log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0}
≤inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim
t→+∞max
u∈K
1
t log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0} = dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K).
(6.41)
Since for ﬁxed t > 0 and d ∈[0, n]

by Lemma 6.5(property (6.15)) and (6.34) we have
Proposition 6.2
dimH K ≤dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) ≤dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K) ≤dimL(ϕt, K) ∀t > 0.
(6.42)
6In [15] Constantin, Foias, Temam stated that if supu∈K lim supt→+∞

ωd(Dϕt(u))
1/t < 1
or lim supt→+∞supu∈K

ωd(Dϕt(u))
1/t < 1, then dimH K ≤d. In [25] Eden considered the
value dimDO
L (K) = inf{d > 0 : supu∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) converges to zero exponentially as t →∞}
and called it the Douady-Oesterlé dimension of K.
7Comparing the expressions in the deﬁnitions (6.33) and (6.40), remark that we can change
1
t
in (6.40) to another scalar positive monotonically decreasing function q(t) such that
inft>0 q(t) maxu∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)) = limt→+∞q(t) maxu∈K ωd(Dϕt(u)). The last relation is impor-
tant from a computational point of view.

Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Spaces
Corollary 6.7 Taking inft>0 in (6.42), we obtain
dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) = dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K).
(6.43)
Deﬁnition 6.5 The local Lyapunov dimension of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 at
the point u is deﬁned as
dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, u) := inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim sup
t→+∞
1
t log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0}.
(6.44)
By (6.24) and Lemma 6.5(property (6.21)) we have
sup
u∈K
inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim sup

= inf{d ∈[0, n] : sup
u∈K
lim sup
t→+∞
1
t log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0}.
(6.45)
Therefore, by (6.25) and Lemma 6.5(property (6.16)) we get
sup
u∈K
dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, u) = sup
u∈K
inf{d ∈[0, n] : lim sup

u∈K
1
t log ωd(Dϕt(u)) < 0}
= dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K).
(6.46)
Proposition 6.3 If there is a critical equilibrium point ucr
eq such that (6.38) is valid,
then
dimL(ϕT , ucr
eq) = dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, ucr
eq) = sup
u∈K
dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K)
and from (6.42) it follows that
dimH K ≤dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) = dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, K) = dimE
L ({ϕt}t≥0, ucr
eq)
= dimL(ϕT , K).
(6.47)
In this case for the estimation of the Hausdorff dimension by (6.47) we need only

equilibrium point or to a periodic orbit [23].

6.3.1
Lyapunov Exponents: Various Deﬁnitions
Deﬁnition 6.6 The Lyapunov exponent functions of singular values (also called
ﬁnite-time Lyapunov exponents [1]) of the dynamical system

{ϕt}t≥0,
(U ⊂Rn, | · |)

at the point u ∈U are denoted by
νi(t, u) = νi(Dϕt(u)),
i = 1, 2, ..., n,
ν1(t, u) ≥· · · ≥νn(t, u), ∀t > 0,
and deﬁned as
νi(t, u) := 1
t log αi(t, u).
Deﬁnition 6.7 The Lyapunov exponents (LEs) of singular values8 of the dynamical
system {ϕt}t≥0 at the point u are deﬁned (see, e.g. [15, 79]) as
νi(u) := lim sup
t→+∞
νi(t, u) = lim sup
t→+∞
1
t log(αi(t, u)),
i = 1, 2, .., n.
Often νi(u) are called upper LEs and denoted as νi(u), while ν i(u) := lim inf
t→+∞
νi(t, u) are called lower LEs. Remark that the Lyapunov exponents of singular values
are the same for any fundamental matrices of the linearized systems (6.4) or (6.5).
Proposition 6.4 (see, e.g. [46]) For the matrix Dϕt(u)P, where P is a non-singular
n × n matrix (i.e., det P ̸= 0), one has
lim
t→+∞

νi(Dϕt(u)) −νi(Dϕt(u)P)

= 0,
i = 1, 2, ..., n.
8We add “of singular value” to distinguish this deﬁnition from other deﬁnitions of Lyapunov expo-
nents; if the differences in the deﬁnitions are not signiﬁcant for the presentation, we use the term
“Lyapunov exponents” or “LEs”.

i(Dϕt(u)), i = 1, 2, ..., n, u ∈U
are deﬁned as
νL
i(t, u) := 1
t log |νi(t, u)|.
The ordered Lyapunov exponent functions of the fundamental matrix columns at the
point u (also called ﬁnite-time Lyapunov characteristic exponents) are given by the
ordered set (for all t > 0) of νLi(t, u):
νLo
1(t, u) ≥· · · ≥νLo
n(t, u), ∀t ≥0.
Deﬁnition 6.9 The Lyapunov exponents of the fundamental matrix columns9 are
deﬁned (see [75]) as
νL
i(u) := lim sup
t→+∞
νLo
i (t, u),
i = 1, 2, .., n.
Remark 6.2 The Lyapunov exponents of the fundamental matrix columns may be
different for different fundamental matrices in contrast to the deﬁnition of Lyapunov
exponents of singular values (see, e.g. Proposition 6.4). To get the set of all possible
values of Lyapunov exponents of the fundamental matrix columns (the set with
the minimal sum of values), one has to consider the so-called normal fundamental
matrices (see [60, 75]).
Deﬁnition 6.10 The relative Lyapunov exponents of singular value functions of the
dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 at the point u are deﬁned (see, e.g. [79]) as

ν1(u) := lim sup
t→+∞
(ν1(t, u)),

νi+1(u) := lim sup
t→+∞
(ν1(t, u) + · · · + νi+1(t, u))−
−lim sup
t→+∞
(ν1(t, u) + · · · + νi(t, u)), i = 1, ..., n −1.
For k = 1, 2, .., n we have

ν1(u) + · · · +
νk(u) = lim sup
t→+∞
(ν1(t, u) + · · · + νk(t, u)),
9Often they are called Lyapunov characteristic exponents (LCE) [60]. In [75] these values are
deﬁned with the opposite sign and called characteristic exponents at the point u.

From the Fischer-Courant theorem ([34], Theorem 2.1, Chap. 2) it follows (see,

νi(t, u) ≤νL
i(t, u), ∀t ≥0, ∀u ∈U,
i = 1, 2, .., n.
(6.50)
Deﬁnition 6.11 ([14, 15]) The relative global (or uniform) Lyapunov exponents of
singular value functions of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 with respect to the compact
invariant set K ⊂U are deﬁned as

ν1(K) := lim sup

ν1(K) =

ν1(u) + · · · +
νi(u) ≤
ν1(K) + · · · +
νi(K), i = 1, 2, ..., n.
(6.51)
At the same time, according to (6.24), there exists ucr(m) ∈K (it may be not unique)
such that the above expressions in (6.51) coincide [23, 24, 26]:

Various characteristics of chaotic behavior are based on Lyapunov exponents
(e.g., LEs are used in the Kaplan-Yorke formula of the Lyapunov dimension and the
sum of positive LEs may be used [76, 82] as the characteristic of the Kolmogorov-
Sinai entropy rate [40, 93]). The properties of Lyapunov exponents and their various
generalizations are studied, e.g., in [2, 4, 10, 17, 37, 42, 46, 47, 58, 60, 75, 79, 82].

If log(ωn(Dϕt(u))) ≤0 for ﬁxed t > 0 and a given point u ∈K, then by (6.27) for

1
t log(ωd(t,u)(Dϕt(u))) = 0,

punov exponents, i.e., the ordered set {νi(t, u)}n

may be used with other types of Lyapunov exponents (see below).
Further we assume that the relation s(t, u) = 0 for d0(t, u) = 0 and d0(t, u) = n
follows from the ﬁrst expression for s(t, u). Since 1
t log(ωd(t,u)(Dϕt(u))) ≤0 ⇔
ωd(t,u)(Dϕt(u)) ≤1 for t > 0, from (6.31) we have

For a given invariant set K and a given point p ∈K there are two essential
questions related to the computation of Lyapunov exponents and the use of the
Kaplan-Yorke formulas of local Lyapunov dimension supu∈K dimKY
L ({νi(u)}n
1) and
supu∈K dimKY
L ({
νi(u)}n

or
supu∈K dimKY
L ({
νi(u)}n
1)
?= supu∈K\{ϕt(p),t≥0} dimKY
L ({
νi(u)}n
1).
In order to get rigorously a positive answer to these questions, from a theoretical
point of view, one may use various ergodic properties of the dynamical system
{ϕt}t≥0 (see, Oseledec [79], Ledrappier [52], and some auxiliary results in [6, 19]).
However, from a practical point of view, the rigorous use of the above results is a
challenging task (see, e.g. the corresponding discussions in [5, 16, 81, 102] and the
works on Perron effects of the largest Lyapunov exponent sign reversals [47, 60]).
For an example of the effective rigorous use of ergodic theory for the estimation of
the Hausdorff and Lyapunov dimensions see, e.g. [87].
Thus, in the general case, from a practical point of view, one cannot rely on the
above relations (a) and (b) and shall use lim supt→+∞in the deﬁnitions of local
Lyapunov exponents and the corresponding formulas for the Lyapunov dimension
(see, e.g. [98]).
However, if p is an equilibrium point, then the expression “lim supt→+∞” in
Deﬁnitions 6.7, 6.9, and 6.10 can be replaced by “limt→+∞” and we have
Lemma 6.7 Let ϕt(p) be a stationary point, i.e. ϕt(p) ≡p. Then for i = 1, 2, ..., n
we have
lim
t→+∞νi(t, p) = νi(p) = 
νi(p) = νL
i(p).
Thus, for d0 = d0


, we get
Proposition 6.11 If the critical points in (6.48) and (6.58) coincide with an equi-
librium point ucr

If ucr
L = ucr(d0) = ucr(d0 + 1) belongs to a periodic orbit with period T , then the
same reasoning can be applied for (ϕT )t.
The last section of this chapter is devoted to the examples in which the maximum
of the local Lyapunov dimension achieves at an equilibrium point.
Taking into account the existence of different deﬁnitions of Lyapunov dimension
and related formulas and following [16], we recommend that whatever you call your
Lyapunov dimension, please state clearly how is it being computed.

Analytical Estimates of the Lyapunov Dimension
and its Invariance with Respect to Diffeomorphisms
Along with widely used numerical methods for estimating and computing the Lya-
punov dimension (see, e.g. MATLAB realizations of the methods based on QR and
SVD decompositions in [51, 66]) there is an effective analytical approach, proposed
by G.A. Leonov in 1991 [54] (see also [8, 55–57, 59, 62, 66]). The Leonov method
is based on the direct Lyapunov method with special Lyapunov-like functions. The
advantage of this method is that it allows one to estimate the Lyapunov dimension of
an invariant set without localization of the set in the phase space and in many cases
to get effectively exact Lyapunov dimension formula [55, 58, 62–64, 67, 71, 72].
Following [44], next the invariance of Lyapunov dimension with respect to dif-
feomorphisms and its relation with the Leonov method are discussed. An analog of
the Leonov method for discrete time dynamical systems is suggested.
While topological dimensions are invariant with respect to Lipschitz homeomor-
phisms, the Hausdorff dimension is invariant with respect to Lipschitz diffeomor-
phisms and non-integer Hausdorff dimension is not invariant with respect to home-
omorphisms [35]. Since the Lyapunov dimension is used as an upper estimate of
Hausdorff dimension, the question arises whether the Lyapunov dimension is invari-
ant under diffeomorphisms (see, e.g. [44, 80]).
Consider the dynamical system

{ϕt}t≥0, (U ⊂Rn, | · |)

under the change of
coordinates w = h(u), where h : U ⊂Rn →Rn is a diffeomorphism. In this case the
semi-orbit γ +(u) = {ϕt(u), t ≥0} is mapped to the semi-orbit deﬁned by ϕt
h(w) =
ϕt
h(h(u)) = h(ϕt(u)), the dynamical system

{ϕt}t≥0, (U ⊂Rn, | · |)

is transformed
to the dynamical system

{ϕt
h}t≥0, (h(U) ⊂Rn, | · |)

, and a compact set K ⊂U
invariant with respect to {ϕt}t≥0 is mapped to the compact set h(K) ⊂h(U) invariant
with respect to {ϕt
h}t≥0. Here we have
Dwϕt
h(w) = Dw

h(ϕt(h−1(w)))

and
Dϕt

(6.62)
If u ∈K, then ϕt(u) and ϕt
h(h(u)) deﬁne bounded semi-orbits. Remark that Dh
and (Dh)−1 are continuous and, thus, Dh(ϕt(u)) and (Dh(ϕt(u)))−1 are bounded
in t. From (6.9) it follows that for any d ∈[0, n] there is a constant c = c(d) ≥1

The above statements are rigorous reformulations from [46, 58] and imply the
following
Proposition 6.12 ([44]) The Lyapunov dimension of the dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0
with respect to the compact invariant set K is invariant with respect to any diffeo-
morphism h : U ⊂Rn →Rn, i.e.
dimL({ϕt}t≥0, K) = dimL({ϕt
h}t≥0, h(K)).

Consider now the Leonov method of analytical estimation of the Lyapunov dimen-

feomorphisms. As it is shown below the multiplier of the type κ(ϕt(u))(κ(u))−1 in
(6.70) plays the role of a Lyapunov-like function.13
Let us apply the linear change of variables w = h(u) = Su with a non-singular
n × n matrix S. Then ϕt(p) = u(t, p) is transformed into ϕt
S(w0):
ϕt

Remark that in the above approach we need only the Douady-Oesterlé theorem

by Eden, Constantin, Foias, Temam in [15, 26] (see (6.40),(6.44), Propositions 6.6
and 6.7).
In [7, 85] and Chapter 5 it is demonstrated, how a technique similar to the above
can be effectively applied to derive constructive upper bounds of the topological
entropy of dynamical systems.

Analytical Formulas of Exact Lyapunov Dimension

Next we consider examples smooth dynamical systems generated by difference and
differential equations (for an example of PDE, see e.g. [21]) in which the critical
point, corresponding to the maximum of the local Lyapunov dimension, is one of
the equilibrium points (see (6.47)). In these examples we assume the existence of an
invariant set K in which the corresponding dynamical system {ϕt}t≥0 is deﬁned, and
use the compact notation dimL(K) for the Lyapunov dimension instead of (6.33).

otherwise any positive semi-orbit tends to the equilibria set as t →+∞.
Proof Following [53] let us present the sketch of the proof.
Case (1): r ≤1. In this case system (6.81) has the unique equilibrium u1 = (0, 0, 0).
Using Theorem 1.1 it was shown in Example 1.10, Chap. 1 that the equilibrium u1
is globally asymptotically stable.
Case (2): r > 1 and 2σ ≤b. Now system (6.81) has three equilibrium points and the
assumptions of Corollary (2.15), Chap. 2 are satisﬁed. It follows that any positive
semi-orbit of system (6.81) converges to an equilibrium.
Case (3): 1 < r < (b + 1)( b
σ + 1), 2σ > b. In this case we apply Corollary 5.9,
Chap. 5. To do this we specify a linear change of coordinates by a nonsingular
(3 × 3)-matrix S and differentiable scalar function V : U ⊂R3 →R1 to satisfy the
condition
λ1(u, S) + λ2(u, S) + ˙V (u) < 0,
∀u ∈Z,
(6.90)
where λ1(u, S) > λ2(u, S) > λ3(u, S) are the eigenvalues of the symmetrized matrix

For that we consider the two cases

Attractors of Dynamical Systems
6.6.1
Computation of Attractors and Lyapunov Dimension
The study of a dynamical system typically begins with an analysis of the equilibria,
which are easily found numerically or analytically. Therefore, from a computational
perspective, it is natural to suggest the following classiﬁcation of attractors, which
is based on the simplicity of ﬁnding their basins of attraction in the phase space:

6.6 Attractors of Dynamical Systems
295
Fig. 6.1
Numerical visualization of self-excited chaotic attractor in the Lorenz system. Global
B-attractor (left subﬁgure), dimL (K) = supu∈K dimL (u) = dimL (S0) = 2.4013 according to (93)
global attractor (right subﬁgure), dimL (K) ≈2.0565 by numerical computation. Parameters:
r = 28, σ = 10, b = 8/3
Deﬁnition 6.12 [61, 66, 68, 69] An attractor is called a self-excited attractor if its
basin of attraction intersects with any open neighborhood of a stationary state (an
equilibrium), otherwise it is called a hidden attractor .
Self-excited attractor in a system can be found using the standard computational
procedure,i.e.,byconstructingasolutionusinginitialdatafromasmallneighborhood
of the equilibrium, observing how it is attracted and, thus, visualizes the attractor. For
example, in the Lorenz system (6.81) with classical parameters σ = 10, b = 8/3,
r = 28 there is a chaotic attractor, which is self-excited with respect to all three
equilibria and could have been found using the standard computational procedure
with initial data in vicinity of any of the equilibria (see Fig.6.1).
Here it is possible to check numerically that for the considered parameters the local
attractor is a global attractor (i.e., there are no other attractors in the phase space).
In this case the global B-attractor involves the chaotic local attractor, three unstable
equilibria and their unstable manifolds attracted to the chaotic local attractor.
However it is known that for other values of parameters, e.g. σ = 10, b = 8/3,
r = 24.5 [95], the chaotic local attractor in the Lorenz system may be self-excited
with respect to the zero unstable equilibrium only. In this case there are three coex-
isting minimal local attractors (see Fig.6.2): chaotic local attractor and two trivial
local attractors—stable equilibria S1,2.
Self-excited attractors in a multistable system can be found using the standard
computational procedure, whereas there is no standard way of predicting the exis-
tence of hidden attractors in a system.
While the multistability is a property of the system, the self-excited and hidden
properties are properties of the attractor and its basin. For example, hidden attractors
are attractors in systems with no equilibria or with only one stable equilibrium (a
special case of multistability and coexistence of attractors).
In general, there is no straightforward way of predicting the existence or coexis-
tence of hidden attractors in a system (see, e.g. [18, 45, 48–50, 61, 65, 66, 68, 69]). A

dimL (K) ≈2.1322 by numerical computation) coexists with local B-attractor (dimL (K) =
supu∈K dimL (u) = dimL (S0) = 2.8917 by (6.106)). Global B-attractor involves the local B-
attractor and the hidden local attractor
numerical search of hidden attractors by evolutionary algorithms is discussed in [104,
105]. Recent examples of hidden attractors can be found in The European Physical
Journal Special Topics: Multistability: Uncovering Hidden Attractors, 2015 (see [9,
27, 28, 38, 73, 83, 86, 89–91, 96, 100, 106]).
For example, in the Glukhovsky-Dolzhansky system and the corresponding gener-
alized Lorenz system (6.104) with parameters r = 700, A = 0.0052, σ = r A, b = 1
a hidden chaotic local attractor can be found [65, 66] (see Fig.6.3).
Remarkthatifasystemisprovedtoanabsorbingset,thenallself-excitedorhidden
local attractors of the system are inside this absorbing bounded domain and can be
found numerically. However, in general, the determination of the number and mutual
disposition of chaotic minimal local attractors in the phase space for a system may be
a challenging problem [62] (see, e.g. the corresponding well-known problem for two-
dimensional polynomial systems — the second part of the 16th Hilbert problem on

6.6 Attractors of Dynamical Systems
297
the number and mutual disposition of limit cycles [33]).14 Thus the advantage of the
analytical method for the Lyapunov dimension estimation, suggested in Theorem 6.4,
is that it is useful not only for dissipative systems (see, e.g. estimation of the Lyapunov
dimension for one of the Rössler systems [59]) but also allows one to estimate the
Lyapunov dimension of invariant set without localization of the set in the phase
space.
Remark that, from a computational perspective, it is not feasible to check numer-
ically the attractivity property for all initial states of the phase space of a dynamical
system. A natural generalization of the notion of an attractor is the consideration
of the weaker attraction requirements: almost everywhere or on a set of positive
measure (see, e.g. [77] and Chap. 1). See also trajectory attractors [11, 13, 88]. In
numerical computations, to distinguish an artiﬁcial computer generated chaos from
a real behavior of the system, one can consider the shadowing property of the system
(see, e.g., the survey in [84]).
We can typically see an attractor (or global attractor) in numerical experiments.
The notion of a B-attractor is mostly used in the theory of dimensions, where we
consider invariant sets covered by balls. The uniform attraction requirement of the
attractor implies that a global B-attractor involves a set of stationary points S and the
corresponding unstable manifolds W u (see Chap. 1). The same is true for B-attractor
if the considered neighborhood Kε of the attractor contains some of the stationary
points from S. This allows one to get analytical estimations of the Lyapunov dimen-
sion for B-attractors and even formulas since the local Lyapunov dimension at a
stationary point can be easily obtained analytically (but this does not help for chaotic
minimal local attractors, hidden B-attractors since they do not involve any stationary
points).
From a computational perspective, numerically check the attractivity property
of an attractor is also difﬁcult. Therefore, if the basin of attraction involves unsta-
ble manifolds of equilibria, then computing the minimal attractor and the unstable
manifolds that are attracted to it may be regarded as an approximation of the mini-
mal B-attractor. For example, consider the visualization of the Lorenz attractor from
the neighborhood of the zero saddle equilibria. Note that a minimal global attractor
involves the set S and its basin of attraction involves the set W u(S).
For the computation of the Lyapunov dimension of an attractor A we consider a
sufﬁciently large time T and a sufﬁciently dense grid of points Agrid on the attractor,
compute the local Lyapunov dimensions by the corresponding Kaplan-Yorke formula
dimKY
L ({νi(T, u)}n
1), and take the maximum on the grid:
maxu∈Agrid dimKY
L ({νi(T, u)}n
1).
14The numerical search of hidden attractors can be complicated by the small size of the basin of
attraction with respect to the considered set of parameters p ∈P and subset of the phase space
U0 ⊂U: following [9, 103], the attractor may be called a rare attractor if the measure μ of the
basin of attractors β(Kp) for the considered set of parameters p ∈P is small with respect to
the considered part of the phase space U0 ⊂U, i.e.
)
p∈P μ(β(Kp)∩U0)
μ(U0)
<< 1. Also computational
difﬁculties may be caused by the shape of basin of attraction, e.g. by Wada and riddled basins.

Lyapunov Dimension for Dynamical Systems in Euclidean Spaces
Since numerically we can check only that all points of the grid belong to
the basin of attraction, the following remark is useful. Let a point u0 belong to
the basin of attraction of the attractor A. Consider the union of the semi-orbit
γ +(u0) = {ϕt(u0), t ≥0} and the attractor A: K(u0) = A ∪γ +(u0). According to
the deﬁnition of the basin of attraction, the ω-limit set of ϕt(u0) belong to A, thus
the set K(u0) is compact and invariant. Since A ⊃K(ϕt(u0)) ⊃K(u0), we have
dimL(ϕt, A) = max
u∈A dimL(ϕt, u) ≤
max
u∈K(ϕt(u0)) dimL(ϕt, u) ≤max
u∈K(u0) dimL(ϕt, u).
Since ρ

K(u0), K(ϕt(u0))

→0 for t →+∞, from the property (6.32) and the
continuity (Lemma 6.2), it follows that
dimL = lim inf
t→+∞
max
u∈K(ϕt(u0)) dimL(ϕt, u).
6.7
Computation of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents
and Dimension in MATLAB
The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a fundamental matrix Dϕt(u0) has the
form
Dϕt(u0) = U(t, u0)˝(t, u0)VT (t, u0) :
U(t, u0)T U(t, u0) ≡I ≡V(t, u0)T V(t, u0),
where ˝(t) = diag{α1(t, u0), ..., αn(t, u0)} is a diagonal matrix with positive real
diagonal entries consistingof singular values. We now give a MATLAB implemen-
tation [66] of the discrete SVD method for computing the ﬁnite-time Lyapunov
exponents {νi(t, u0)}n
1 based on the product SVD algorithm (see, e.g., [20, 97]).

Dimension Estimates on Riemannian
Manifolds

Chapter 7
Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation
on Manifolds
Abstract In this chapter we present some auxiliary results from the linear operator
theory and stability theory which are used in the sequel for dimension estimation. In
Sect.7.1 some elements of the exterior calculus of linear operators in linear spaces
are introduced. Section7.2 is concerned with orbital stability results for vector ﬁelds
on Riemannian manifolds.

Exterior Calculus in Linear Spaces, Singular Values
of an Operator and Covering Lemmas
7.1.1
Multiplicative and Additive Compounds of Operators
In this subsection we introduce for operators acting between ﬁnite dimensional linear
spaces, their multiplicative and additive compounds. It will be shown that in special
bases the matrices of these operators coincide with the multiplicative and additive
compound matrices, respectively, introduced in Sect. 2.3, Chap. 2.
Our representation in Sect. 7.1.1 is based on the results of [10]. Similar problems
in Hilbert space are treated in [13, 31, 34].
Deﬁnition 7.1 Suppose that V is an n-dimensional linear space over the ﬁeld K and
k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is a natural number. With V∧k or ΛkV we denote the k-th exterior
power of V, i.e. the linear space consisting of all linear combinations of the formal
expressions ξ1 ∧ξ2 ∧· · · ∧ξk with ξ j ∈V, j = 1, 2, . . . , k, such that the following
rules hold:
(1) For any permutation π = ( j1, . . . , jk) of (1, . . . , k) we have
ξ j1 ∧· · · ∧ξ jk = sign π · ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk , ∀ξi ∈V, i = 1, . . . , k ;
(2) ξ1 ∧ξ2 ∧· · · ∧ξk + η1 ∧ξ2 ∧· · · ∧ξk = (ξ1 + η1) ∧ξ2 ∧· · · ∧ξk , ∀ξi, η1 ∈V,i
= 1, . . . , k ;
(3) (λ ξ1) ∧ξ2 ∧· · · ∧ξk = λ(ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk) ,
∀λ ∈K, ∀ξi ∈V, i = 1, 2, . . . , k ;

Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
(4) There exist n linearly independent vectors e1, . . . , en ∈V such that the
n
k

vectors ei1 ∧· · · ∧eik , 1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤n, are linearly independent in
V∧k .
Proposition 7.1 Suppose V is an n-dimensional linear space over K and
k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is arbitrary. Then:
(1) V∧k has the dimension
n
k

and for any basis e1, . . . , en of V the vectors
ei1 ∧· · · ∧eik, 1 ≤i1 < · · · < ik ≤n, form a basis of V∧k.
(2) ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk = 0 for ξi ∈V, i = 1, . . . , k , if and only if ξ1, . . . , ξk are linearly
dependent in V .
Proof See a standard book on linear algebra.
□
Remark 7.1 (a) If k > n then any vectors ξ1, . . . , ξk from V are linearly dependent.
According to Proposition 7.1 it is naturally to deﬁne in this case ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk = 0.
It follows that V∧k = {0} for k = n + 1, n + 2, . . . . Let us deﬁne V∧1 := V and
V∧0 := K. Then V∧k exists for all k = 0, 1, . . . .
(b) Again from Proposition 7.1 we have dim V∧k =
n
k

=
 n
n−k

= dim V∧(n−k)
for k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
(c)Fork = 1, 2, . . .wehaveV∧k = span{ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk | ξi ∈V , i = 1, 2, . . . , k}.
Elements of V∧k which have the form ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk are called decomposable or sim-
ple k-vectors.
(d) V∧:=
n
k=0
V∧k is the exterior or Grassmann algebra of V .
Deﬁnition 7.2 Suppose that V and W are linear spaces of dimension n and m,
respectively, over K, k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is a number and S : V →W is a linear map.
The k-th multiplicative compound or k-th exterior power of S is the linear map
S∧k : V∧k →W∧k, deﬁned for decomposable vectors of V∧k by
S∧k(ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk) = S ξ1 ∧· · · ∧S ξk ,
ξi ∈V, i = 1, . . . , k ,
and for non-decomposable vectors by linearity, i.e.
S∧k(β(ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk) + β′(η1 ∧· · · ∧ηk))
= βS∧k(ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk) + β′ S∧k(η1 ∧· · · ∧ηk) , ξi, η j ∈V,
i, j = 1, . . . , k, β, β′ ∈K .
Remark 7.2 It is easy to see that Deﬁnition 7.2 is correct, i.e. depends in fact only
on the products ξ1 ∧· · · ∧ξk , ξi ∈V, i = 1, 2, . . . , k.
Proposition 7.2 Suppose that V, W and W ′ are linear spaces of dimension n, m
and r, respectively, over K, and S : V →W and T : W →W ′ are linear maps.
Then we have:

(a) If k ∈{1, 2, . . . , min(m, n,r)} then (T S)∧k = T ∧kS∧k ;
(b) If k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} then (idV)∧k = idV∧k ;
(c) Suppose that n = m, the map S : V →W is invertible and k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}.
Then S∧k : V∧k →W∧k is invertible and (S∧k)−1 = (S−1)∧k ;
(d) Suppose that V = W and S : V →V has the eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λn (each
eigenvalue λi repeated with respect to the algebraic multiplicity) and the asso-
ciated eigenvectors e1, . . . , en. Then, for any k ∈{1, . . . , n} the map S∧k has the
n
k

eigenvalues λi1, . . . , λik and the associated eigenvectors ei1∧· · · ∧eik, 1 ≤
i1 < · · · < ik ≤n ;
(e) Suppose V = W and S : V →V is a linear operator. Then S∧n = det S.
Proof (a) We have by deﬁnition for arbitrary ξi ∈V, i = 1, . . . , k, and decompos-
able vectors
(T ∧k S∧k) (ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk) = T ∧k(S ξ1∧· · · ∧S ξk)
= (T S ξ1∧· · · ∧T S ξk) = (T S)∧k(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk) .
For non-decomposable vectors the same formula holds by linearity.
(b) Again we have (idV)∧k(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk) = ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk = idV∧k ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk for
all decomposable vectors. The remaining part follows by linearity.
(c) By (a) and (b) we conclude from SS−1 = idW that (S∧k) (S−1)∧k = (idW)∧k =
idW∧k. It follows that (S∧k)−1 = (S−1)∧k.
(d) and (e) can be shown as for matrices (see Proposition 2.9, Chap. 2).
□
Deﬁnition 7.3 Suppose that E is an n-dimensional Euclidean space over K with
scalar product (·, ·)E and suppose that k ∈{1, . . . , n} is arbitrary. A scalar product
(·, ·)E∧k in E∧k is deﬁned for decomposable vectors ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk,
η1∧· · · ∧ηk ∈E∧k by
(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk, η1∧· · · ∧ηk)E∧k = det [(ξi, η j)E |k
i, j=1]
and for non-decomposable vectors from E∧k by linearity, i.e.
(β(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk) + β′(ξ ′
1∧· · · ∧ξ ′
k) , η1∧· · · ∧ηk)E∧k
= β(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk, η1∧· · · ∧ηk)E∧k + β′(ξ ′
1∧· · · ∧ξ ′
k, η1∧· · · ∧ηk)E∧k ,
∀ξi, ξ ′
j, ηl ∈E, i, j,l = 1, . . . , k,
∀β, β′ ∈K .
Deﬁnition 7.4 Two bases {ξ1, . . . , ξk} and {η1, . . . , ηk} of a k-dimensional subspace
of the n-dimensional Euclidean space (E, (·, ·)E) over R have the same orientation
if in the representation ηi = k
j=1 ci jξ j with (ci j) ∈Mk(R) we have det(ci j) > 0 .
Proposition 7.3 Suppose that {ξ1, . . . , ξk} is a system of linearly independent vec-
tors in the n-dimensional Euclidean space (E, (·, ·)E) over R. If {η1, . . . , ηk} is some
other linearly independent system in E, then ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk = η1∧· · · ∧ηk if and only
if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
(a) span{ξ1, . . . , ξk} = span{η1, . . . , ηk} ;
(b) Both systems have the same orientation;
(c) det [(ξi, ξ j)E|k
i, j=1] = det [(ηi, η j)E|k
i, j=1] .
Proof See [9] or any other text book on linear algebra.
□
Remark 7.3 The properties of the determinant show that (·, ·)E∧k is really a scalar
product.ThenorminE∧k isasusual|υ|E∧k = √(υ, υ)E∧k , ∀υ ∈E∧k.
Proposition 7.4 If {ei}n
i=1 is an orthonormal basis of the n-dimensional Euclidean
space (E, (·, ·)E), then for any k ∈{1, . . . , n} the family of vectors
{ei1∧· · · ∧eik}1≤i1<···<ik≤n forms an orthonormal basis in (E∧k, (·, ·)E∧k) .
Proof Follows immediately from the deﬁnition of (·, ·)E∧k.
□
Deﬁnition 7.5 Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are two n- resp. m-dimensio-
nal Euclidean spaces over R and S : E →F is a linear operator. The linear operator
S[∗] : F →E deﬁned (uniquely) by
(S ξ, η)F = (ξ, S[∗]η)E ,
∀ξ ∈E, ∀η ∈F ,
is the adjoint operator of S.
Example 7.1 (a) Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) is an n-dimensional Euclidean space, S :
E →E is a linear operator. Then S[∗] = S∗is the usual adjoint operator.
(b) Consider Rn as Euclidean space E with the scalar product (ξ, η)E :=
(ξ, Gη)n, ∀ξ, η ∈Rn, where G = G∗> 0 is a given positive deﬁnite matrix. The
Euclidean space F is deﬁned as Rn equipped with the scalar product (ξ, η)F :=
(ξ, G′η), ∀ξ, η ∈Rn, where again G′ = G′∗> 0 is an n × n matrix.
Assume that a linear operator is in the canonical basis e1, . . . , en of Rn given by
the matrix S. By deﬁnition the adjoint operator S[∗] is characterized by the equation
(S ξ, η)F = (ξ, S[∗]η)E ,
∀ξ, η ∈Rn , i.e. by
(Sξ, G′η)n = (ξ, GS[∗]η)n ,
∀ξ, η ∈Rn .
It follows that S[∗] = G−1S∗G′, where S∗is the usual transposed matrix to S.
Proposition 7.5 Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are n-resp. m-dimensional
Euclidean spaces over R, S : E →F is a linear operator, and suppose that
k ∈{1, . . . , n} is arbitrary. Then
(S[∗])∧k = (S∧k)[∗] .
Proof It is sufﬁcient to show the assertion for decomposable vectors. Consider for
arbitrary ξi ∈E, η j ∈F, i, j = 1, . . . , k,

Deﬁnition 7.6 Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are n-dimensional Euclidean
spaces over R and S : E →F is an invertible linear operator. The map S is called
orthogonal if S−1 = S[∗].
Proposition 7.6 Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are n-dimensional
Euclidean spaces over R and S : E →F is orthogonal. Then for any
k ∈{1, . . . , n} the operator S∧k : E∧k →F∧k is orthogonal and
(S∧k)−1 = (S∧k)[∗] = (S[∗])∧k .
Proof By Proposition 7.2 we have, using the orthogonality,
(S∧k) (S[∗])∧k = (SS[∗])∧k = (idF)∧k = idF∧k .
From this and by Proposition 7.5 it follows that
(S∧k)−1 = (S[∗])∧k = (S∧k)[∗] .

for all ξ1, . . . , ξk ∈V by
Sk(ξ1∧· · · ∧ξk) = Sξ1∧· · · ∧ξk + ξ1 ∧S ξ2∧· · · ∧ξk + · · · + ξ1∧· · · ∧S ξk
and extended to V∧k by linearity.
Some frequently used notions and their symbols are presented in Table7.1.

Remark 7.4 Proposition 7.10, can be used to give a short proof of the Binet-Cauchy
theorem (Proposition 2.3, Chap. 2). Consider two given matrices A ∈Mn,m(K) and
B ∈Mm,p(K) as matrix realization of the two linear operators S : W →W ′ and
T : V →W, where V, W and W ′ are linear spaces of dimensions p, m and n,
respectively.
Proposition 7.11 Suppose that V = Kn is the n-dimensional vector space of n-
columns over K, k ∈{1, . . . , n} is a natural number and u1, . . . , uk ∈Kn are arbi-
trary vector columns. Then we have u1∧· · · ∧uk = C(k), where C is the n × k matrix
having as columns the vectors u1, u2, . . . , uk .

The next proposition shows the connection between additive compounds of an
operator and additive compound matrices.
Proposition 7.12 Suppose that V is an n-dimensional vector space over K, k ∈
{1, . . . , n} is a natural number, {e1, . . . , en} is a basis of V, {e1, . . . ,e(n
k)} is the
lexicographically ordered basis of V∧k given by e j = e j1∧· · · ∧e jk with ( j) =
( j1, . . . , jk). If S : V →V is a linear operator, Sk : V∧k →V∧k is the k-th addi-
tive compound operator of S, and [S] and [Sk] are the matrices of these operators
in the above bases, then [Sk] = [S][k] .
Proof For any k-tuple 1 ≤j1 < · · · < jk ≤n we can write by deﬁnition
Sk(e j1∧· · · ∧e jk) = Se j1∧· · · ∧e jk + · · · + e j1∧· · · ∧Se jk

(7.1)
where the matrix [S] = (si j) is deﬁned by Se j = n
i=1 si jei , j = 1, 2, . . . , n . In
order to determine the element [Sk]i j of the matrix [Sk] we consider three cases.
Case1: (i) = ( j) = ( j1, . . . , jk). It follows from (7.1) that
[Sk] j j = s j1 j1 + s j2 j2 + · · · + s jk jk .
Case2: (i) is different from ( j) in more than two symbols. Then we get from (7.1)
[Sk]i j =0.
Case3: Exactly one symbol ir from (i) is not included in ( j) and exactly one
symbol jp from ( j) is not included in (i). Thus (i) ∩( j) =: {q1, . . . , qk−1} with

1 ≤q1 < · · · < qk−1 ≤n , where (i) = {q1 . . . , qv, ir, qv+1, . . . , qk−1} and ( j) =
{q1, . . . , qw, jp, qw+1, . . . , qk−1} .
This means that the element [Sk]i j depends only on the terms
eq1∧· · · ∧eqw ∧Se jp ∧eqw+1∧· · · ∧eqk−1 .
Since Se jp = sir jpeir + . . . , we see that [Sk]i j is the coefﬁcient of
sir jp(eq1∧· · · ∧eqw ∧eir ∧eqw+1∧· · · ∧eqk−1)
= (−1)σsir jp(eq1∧· · · ∧eqv ∧eir ∧eqr+1∧· · · ∧eqk−1 ),
i.e. [Sk]i j = (−1)σsir jp , where σ =
 p −r if p ≥r ,
r −p if p < r .
In both cases we have (−1)σ = (−1)p+r .
Thus in all three cases the element [Sk]i j of the matrix [Sk] is computed from the
elements of the matrix [S] according to the rules of computation for the matrix [S][k]
(see Proposition 2.12, Chap. 2). This shows that [Sk] = [S][k].

7.1.2
Singular Values of an Operator Acting Between
Euclidean Spaces
Suppose that E and F are n-dimensional Euclidean spaces with scalar products (·, ·)E
and (·, ·)F, respectively, and S : E →F is a linear operator. Recall that the adjoint
operator S[∗] : F →E is deﬁned uniquely by the relation
(S ξ, η)F = (ξ, S[∗]η)E ,
∀ξ ∈E, ∀η ∈F .
It follows that the operator S[∗]S : E →E is selfadjoint, i.e. (S[∗]S)[∗] = S[∗]S and
non-negative, i.e. (S[∗]S ξ, ξ)E ≥0,
∀ξ ∈E.
It follows also that the eigenvalues of S[∗]S are non-negative. Denote the complete
and ordered system of eigenvalues of S[∗]S by
λ1(S[∗]S) ≥· · · ≥λn(S[∗]S) .
Deﬁnition 7.8 The numbers α1(S) ≥α2(S) ≥· · · ≥αn(S) deﬁned by αi(S) :=

λi(S[∗]S) , i = 1, . . . , n, are the singular values of S.
Example 7.2 (a) Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) is an n-dimensional Euclidean space
over R and S : E →E is a self-adjoint and non-negative linear operator. In this
case S[∗]S = S2 and the singular values of S are the eigenvlues of S, i.e. αi(S) =
λi(S), i = 1, . . . , n .

(b) Let us consider the linear operator given by the n × n matrix S from Example
7.1 (b). It was shown that in the notion of this example S[∗] = G−1S∗G′. This means
that the singular values αi(S) of the matrix S are the non-negative roots of the
eigenvalues of the matrix G−1S∗G′S . Note that the last matrix is similar to the
matrix
G1/2G−1S∗G′SG−1/2 = G−1/2S∗(G′)1/2(G′)1/2SG−1/2 = A∗A
with A := (G′)1/2SG−1/2.
The geometric properties of the singular values of an operator acting between
Euclidean spaces are described in the next proposition.
Proposition 7.13 Suppose that (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are two n-dimensional
Euclidean spaces over R, and S : E →F is a linear operator with singular values
α1 ≥α2 ≥· · · ≥αn > 0. Let Br(0) be the closed ball in E of radius r > 0 and with
center at 0. Then the image of Br(0) under S is an ellipsoid E in F whose semi-axes
have the length α jr, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

As in the matrix case the singular values of an operator can be characterized by a
min-max property.

dimensional Euclidean spaces with associated vector norms | · |E and | · |F, respec-
tively, and T : E →F is a linear operator. Then the singular values of T, α1(T ) ≥

Consider a linear operator T : E →F, where (E, (·, ·)E) and (F, (·, ·)F) are
Euclidean spaces of dimension n. The singular values of T , i.e., the eigenvalues
of the positive operator (T [∗]T )1/2 : E →E, ordered with respect to its size and
multiplicity we denote by α1(T ) ≥α2(T ) ≥· · · ≥αn(T ).

More generally, for an arbitrary real number d ∈[0, n] written in the form d = d0 + s
with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] we introduce the singular value function
of order d of the operator T : E →F by

ωd0(T )1−s · · · ωd0+1(T )s , for d ∈(0, n] ,

Obviously this can also be interpreted as ωd(T ) = |  d0 T |1−s|  d0+1 T |s, where
|  k T | stands for the norm of the k-th exterior power of T , i.e., the norm of the
linear operator  k T :  k E → k F.
If H is a Hilbert space with scalar product and norm (·, ·) and | · |, respectively, and

It is shown in [34] that in case that T is a compact operator the singular values of
T coincide with the eigenvalues of (T ∗T )1/2, where T ∗denotes the Hilbert adjoint
operator. For each real d ≥0 the singular value function ωd(T ) of order d is deﬁned
as above by the formulas (7.5) and (7.6).

Lemmas on Covering of Ellipsoids in an Euclidean
Space
In this subsection we continue the investigation of some covering techniques for ellip-
soids from Sect. 2.1.3, Chap. 2. Let E be an ellipsoid in the n-dimensional Euclidean
space E over R and let a1(E) ≥· · · ≥an(E) denote the length of its semi-axes. For
an arbitrary number d ∈[0, n] written as d = d0 + s with
d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] we introduce the d-dimensional ellipsoid mea-
sure ωd(E) by the formula (2.5), Chap. 2.
Assume now that F is another n-dimensional Euclidean space over R. For the
invertible linear operator T : E →F and the ball Br(0) in E of radius r around the
origin 0 of E the image T Br(0) is by Proposition 7.13 an ellipsoid in F with length
of semi-axes αi(T )r, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. In addition, for d ∈[0, n] it holds
ωd(T Br(0)) = ωd(T )rd.
(7.8)
The next lemma is similar to Lemma 2.1, Chap. 2 and is stated without proof.
Lemma 7.1 Let us consider numbers d ∈(0, n] (written as above), κ > 0, δ > 0
and η > 0 and assume κ ≤δd. Let E be an ellipsoid in E such that a1(E) ≤δ and
ωd(E) ≤κ. Further, we take a ball Bη(0) of radius η in E. Then the set E + Bη(0)
is contained in an ellipsoid E′ which satisﬁes

We call an ellipsoid E ⊂E degenerated if ai(E) = 0 for some i ∈{1, . . . , n}. We
reformulate Lemma 7.1, which is true for a non-degenerated ellipsoid E only. The
following two lemmas where obtained in [12].
Lemma 7.2 Let E be an ellipsoid in an n-dimensional Euclidean space E. Let δ, κ, ς
be positive numbers, d ∈(0, n] written as d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1}
and s ∈(0, 1] and κ ≤δd. Suppose that ωi(E)ςd−i ≤κ for any i = 0, . . . , d0,
ωd(E) ≤κ and a1(E) ≤δ. Then for any η > 0 the sum E + Bη(0) is contained in an
ellipsoid E′ ⊂E which satisﬁes

contains E and for which Lemma 7.1 can be applied.

Singular Value Inequalities for Operators
In this subsection we derive some inequalities for the products of singular values of an
operator which are useful in dimension estimations. In contrast to similar inequalities
in Sect. 2.2, Chap. 2 we consider here the general case of an operator acting between
Euclidean spaces.
The main references for the ﬁrst two propositions are [17, 25, 34].
Proposition 7.14 Suppose E, F and F ′ are n-dimensional Euclidean spaces with
scalar product (·, ·)E, (·, ·)F and (·, ·)F ′, respectively, T : E →F and
S : F →F ′ are linear operators and k ∈{1, . . . , n} is arbitrary. Then
αk(ST ) ≤| S | αk(T ) ,
where | S | is the operator norm of S : F →F ′ and αk(·) denotes the singular values
of the operator.
Proof By deﬁnition we have for k = 1, 2, . . . , n
the following equalities
αk(ST )2 = λk((ST )[∗]ST )andαk(T )2 = λk(T [∗]T ),whereλk(·)denotestheordered
eigenvalues λ1(·) ≥· · · ≥λn(·) of the given positive operator. For any ξ ∈E we can
write
((ST )[∗]ST ξ, ξ)E = ((ST )ξ, (ST )ξ)F ′
= | (ST )ξ |2
F ′ ≤| S |2| T ξ |2
F = | S |2((T [∗]T )ξ, ξ)E .
It follows that

| S |2(T [∗]T )

= | S |2λk(T [∗]T ), k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
But this implies that αk(ST ) ≤| S |αk(T ) k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
□
Proposition 7.15 Suppose that E and F are n-dimensional Euclidean spaces,
T : E →F is a linear operator and k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is arbitrary.
Then it holds:
(a) α1(T )α2(T ) · · · αk(T ) =

The following proposition is due to [17, 28].
Proposition 7.16 (Generalized Horn’s inequality) Suppose that E, F and F ′ are n-
dimensional Euclidean spaces over R, T : E →F and S : F →F ′ are linear oper-
ators. Then for k ∈{1, . . . , n −1} we have ωk(ST ) ≤ωk(S)ωk(T ) and ωn(ST ) =
ωn(S)ωn(T ).
Proof The ﬁrst part follows immediately from the operator norm properties and
Propositions 7.2, 7.15:
ωk(ST ) = |(ST )∧k| = |S∧k| |T ∧k| = ωk(S)ωk(T ) .
The second part follows from these propositions by
ωn(ST ) = |(ST )∧n| = | det(ST )| = | det S| | det T | = ωn(S)ωn(T ) .
□
We ﬁnish this subsection with two statements from [21].
Lemma 7.6 Let T : E →E be a self-adjoint, linear operator on an n-dimensional
Euclidean space E with scalar product (·, ·)E and let α1(T ) ≥· · · ≥αn(T ) denote
the singular values of T ordered with respect to size and multiplicity. Suppose that for
a certain k-dimensional subspace Lk of E (1 ≤k ≤n) and for some number κ ∈R
the relation
(υ, T υ)E ≥κ |υ |2
for all
υ ∈Lk
(7.10)
is satisﬁed. Then
αk(T ) ≥κ.
Proof Let υ1, . . . , υn denote an orthonormal system of eigenvectors of T belonging
to the eigenvalues λ1(T ) = α1(T ), . . . , λn(T ) = αn(T ) of T . If k > 1 then choose
υ ∈Lk such that υ ̸= 0 and
(υ, υi)E = 0
for all
i = 1, . . . , k −1
and if k = 1 then take any υ ∈L1 with υ ̸= 0. In both cases υ can be written as
υ =

Lemma 7.7 Let T : E →E be as in Lemma 7.6 and furthermore invertible. Suppose

Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
The results from [21] represented in Sects. 7.2.1–7.2.7 of this section develop and
generalize various approaches and methods for vector ﬁelds on manifolds that go
back to [18, 22]. These methods can be used to derive orbital stability criteria for
nonlinear feedback systems in terms of the frequency-domain characteristics and
transfer function of the linear part together with conditions on the nonlinear part of
the dynamical system.
7.2.1
The Andronov-Vitt Theorem
Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold of dimension n and smoothness Cm (m > 3).
We consider on M the differential equation
˙u = F(u),
(7.12)
where F : M →T MisavectorﬁeldofclassCl (2 < l ≤m −1).Forsimplicitywe
assume that (7.12) has a ﬂow u : R × M →M (which is Cl) and put ϕt(·) := u(t, ·)
for every t ∈R. It follows that (see Sect. A.6, Appendix A) the curve t →ϕt(p), t ∈
R, is the unique solution of (7.12) with the initial condition ϕ0(p) = p.
Let γ (p) := {ϕt(p) | t ∈R} denote the orbit through p of (7.12) and let γ+(p) :=
{ϕt(p) | t ≥0} be the corresponding positive semi-orbit.
By ρ(·, ·) we denote the geodesic distance on the Riemannian manifold (M, g)
and deﬁne by dist(p, U) := inf{ρ(p, ˜p) | ˜p ∈U} the distance between the point p
and the set U for an arbitrary p ∈M and an arbitrary subset U ⊂M.
An orbit of (7.12) through p is called (positive) Lagrange stable if γ +(p) (i.e. the
closure of γ+(p)) is compact. A solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.12) is called (positive) orbitally

326
7
Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
stable if for each ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that for all ˜p ∈M satisfying
ρ(p, ˜p) < δ and for all t ≥0
dist(ϕt( ˜p), γ+(p)) < ε
holds. We say that ϕ(·)(p) is asymptotically orbitally stable if ϕ(·)(p) is orbitally
stable and if there exists a Δ > 0 such that
lim
t→∞dist(ϕt( ˜p), γ+(p)) = 0
holds for each ˜p ∈M satisfying ρ(p, ˜p) < Δ. A solution is called orbitally unstable
if it is not orbitally stable. It is also common to speak of the stability or instability of
the orbit γ (p) instead of the orbital stability or instability of the solution ϕ(·)(p).
Note that in case γ (p) is an equilibrium point of (7.12) then the orbital stability
and asymptotic orbital stability coincide with the stability and asymptotic stability
in the sense of Lyapunov, respectively, of the equilibrium.
For periodic orbits the well-known Andronov-Vitt theorem (e.g. [1, 2]), offers
criteria for stability and instability in terms of the characteristic exponents or multi-
pliers of the periodic orbit. The multipliers of a T -periodic orbit γ (p) = {ϕt(p) | t ∈
[0, T ]} of (7.12) are the eigenvalues ρ1(p), ρ2(p), . . . , ρn(p) of the differential
dpϕT : TpM →TpM ordered with respect to their modulus and algebraic mul-
tiplicity by |ρ1(p)| ≥|ρ2(p)| ≥· · · ≥|ρn(p)|. One can show that the spectrum of
eigenvalues of dpϕT consists of 1 and of the eigenvalues of du P : TuS →TuS, where
P : S →S is the Poincaré map at an arbitrary chosen point u ∈γ (p) with respect
to a local transversal section S ⊂M. The Andronov-Vitt theorem says that if for
the second multiplier |ρ2(p)| < 1 is satisﬁed (Andronov-Vitt condition), then the
periodic orbit γ (p) is asymptotically stable and the solution paths near γ (p) possess
asymptotic phases [1].
7.2.2
Various Types of Variational Equations
The behaviour of the ﬂow of system (7.12) near a given solution ϕ(·)(p) is described
by the standard variational equation of (7.12)
Dy
dt = ∇F(ϕt(p))y.
(7.13)
Here ∇F(p) : TpM →TpM is the covariant derivative of F at p ∈M. The abso-
lute derivative Dy
dt is taken along the integral curve t →ϕt(p). In local coordinates
of a chart x around ϕt(p) this derivative of y = yi(t)∂i(ϕt(p)) has the form
Dy
dt =
dyi
dt + Γ k
i j y j ˙xi

∂k(ϕt(p)),
where xi(t) are the local coordinates of ϕt(p) in the chart x.

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds

Remark 7.5 The variational equation (7.13) describes a special linear ﬂow on vector
bundles. Suppose that (M, g) is an n-dimensional Riemannian C3-manifold, V is an
m-dimensional real vector space, π : B →M is a Ck-vector bundle over M with
typicalﬁberV.SupposethatonB isdeﬁnedtheCk−1-bundlemetric g ∈Ek−1(T 0
2 (B))
and a connection with covariant derivative ∇(see Sect. A.10, Appendix A). Let us
assume that the connection is metrical.
A linear ﬂow Φ on the vector bundle π : B →M is a ﬂow on B preserving ﬁbers
such that
Φ(t, e1 + e2) = Φ(t, e1) + Φ(t, e2) ,
∀t ∈R,
∀e1, e2 ∈Ep ,
Φ(t, α e) = α Φ(t, e) ,
∀t ∈R,
∀α ∈R,
∀e ∈Ep .
Note that Φ includes a ﬂow π Φ : (id, T) (R × B) →M on the base space M,
which we denote by p · t for t ∈R, p ∈M.
Suppose that A : M →L(B, B) is a section in the vector bundle πL : L(B, B) →
M consisting of all bundle maps whose ﬁber over p ∈M is the vector space of all
linear maps L : Bp →Bp. This means that A associates to any point p ∈M a linear
map A(p) : Bp →Bp. Let us assume that the linear ﬂow Φ on the vector bundle
π : B →M is C1, i.e. there exists a section A as described above such that for any
p ∈M and υ ∈Bp the curve t →Φ(t, (p, υ)) satisﬁes the differential equation
D
dt Φ(t, (p, υ)) = A(p · t)Φ(t, (p, υ)) .
(7.14)
Here D
dt denotes the covariant derivative along the curve t →p · t.
The linearization of the ﬂow ϕ, generated by the vector ﬁeld (7.12), i.e. the map
Φ : R × T M →T M with Φ(t, (p, υ)) := dpϕt(υ) for p ∈M, (p, υ) ∈T M and
t ∈R, is a linear ﬂow on the tangent bundle T M. For ﬁxed p ∈M the behaviour
of the ﬂow lines of ϕ in a neighborhood of ϕ(·)(p) is characterized by the curve
t →Φ(t, (p, υ)) with υ ∈TpM, which satisﬁes for ﬁxed υ the variational equation
(7.14).
Let Y(·, p) be the fundamental operator solution of (7.13) satisfying the initial
condition Y(0, p) = idTpM. Thus Y(t, p) = dpϕt for all t ∈R. Note that, in partic-
ular, F(ϕ(·)(p)) is a (vector) solution of (7.13).
A short calculation shows that the relation
d
dt (y(t), y(t)) = 2
	 Dy(t)
dt
, y(t)

(7.15)
holds for any C1-curve y(·) satisfying y(t) ∈Tϕt(p)M for all t ∈R. Here for every
t ∈R the term (·, ·) stands for the scalar product in Tϕt(p)M introduced by the
Riemannian metric.
For every u ∈M with F(u) ̸= Ou, where Ou denotes the origin of the tangent
space TuM, we introduce the linear subspace

328
7
Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
T ⊥(u) := {z ∈TuM | (z, F(u)) = 0}
of the tangent space TuM. To describe how the orthogonal deviation of a perturbation
in the initial conditions evolves we split a solution y(·) of (7.13) into orthogonal
components
y(t) = z(t) + μ(t)F(ϕt(p)),
(7.16)
with z(t) ∈T ⊥(ϕt(p)) and μ(t) a time-dependent factor which will be speciﬁed
below. Then z(·) is a solution of the system in normal variations with respect to the
solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.12) which is of the form
Dz
dt = A(ϕt(p))z
(7.17)
with a map A(u) : TuM →TuM given by
A(u)υ := ∇F(u)υ −2(F(u), S∇F(u)υ)
|F(u)|2
F(u)
(7.18)
for all υ ∈TuM. In local coordinates of an arbitrary chart x around u the operator
A is deﬁned by
Ak
i := ∇i f k −
2
grs f r f s f kg jl f l S j
i ,
where f k, g jl are the coordinates of the vector ﬁeld F and the Riemannian metric
tensor g in the chart x. Here | · | stands for the norm in the tangent space derived from
the scalar product in the space and S j
i := 1
2(g jk∇k f lgli + ∇i f j) is the representation
in coordinates of the symmetric part S∇F of the covariant derivative of the vector
ﬁeld F. For M = Rn and (gi j) = I the standard metric the operator (7.18) is given
in Sect.3.3. Let Z(·, p) denote the fundamental operator solution of (7.17) with
Z(0, p) = idT ⊥(p). From the deﬁnition (7.18) of A we see that for any t ∈R and
p ∈M the linear operator Z(t, p) acts between the orthogonal subspaces T ⊥(p)
and T ⊥(ϕt(p)) of TpM and of Tϕt(p)M, respectively.
Now let y(·) be a solution of (7.13). We want to consider the splitting (7.16)
into orthogonal components in more detail. The factor μ(·) is a scalar valued Cl−1-
function determined by
μ(t) := (y(t), F(ϕt(p)))
|F(ϕt(p))|2
.
(7.19)
Differentiating the expressions in formula (7.16) and applying formula (7.16) again
gives ∇F(ϕt(p))z(t) = A(ϕt(p))z(t) + ˙μ(t)F(ϕt(p)). If we take now the scalar
product of this term with z(t) we obtain

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
329
(A(ϕt(p))z(t), z(t)) = (∇F(ϕt(p))z(t), z(t)).
(7.20)

of (7.13)
Dy

∇F(ϕt(p))

k y,
(7.21)
where (∇F(u))k :  k TuM → k TuM is the k-th additive compound operator of
∇F(u) (see Sect. 7.1.1). The absolute derivative
D
dt [y1(·) ∧· · · ∧yk(·)] of [y1(·) ∧· · · ∧yk(·)] along t →ϕt(p) is deﬁned by
D

where Dyi(·)

(7.15) can be generalized to

 k Tϕt (p)M

which is valid for every k ∈{1, . . . , n} and every C1-curve y(·) with y(t) ∈
 k Tϕt(p)M for all t ∈R. If Y(·, p) is the fundamental operator solution of (7.13)
satisfying Y(0, p) = idTpM then Y ∧k(·, p) is the fundamental operator solution of
(7.21) satisfying Y ∧k(0, p) = idΛkTpM.
Finally, the trivial solution y ≡0 of (7.21) is called exponentially stable if there
exist constants C > 0 and a > 0 such that for any solution y(·) of (7.21) and any
s ≥0 the inequality
|y(t)| ≤C|y(s)|e−a(t−s)
(7.22)
holds for all t ≥s.
7.2.3
Asymptotic Orbital Stability Conditions
The following theorem from [21] provides a result on orbital stability of solutions of
(7.12) requiring exponential stability properties of the compound variational equation
(7.21) for k = 2. The theorem generalizes similar results for systems in Rn (see [3,
6, 14, 22]).
We say that an orbit γ (p) of (7.12) belongs to BO+ if γ+(p) lies in some open
bounded set U = U(p) ⊂M and any equilibrium of (7.12) which is contained in
the closure U is asymptotically stable.
Theorem 7.2 Consider the equation (7.12) and suppose γ (p) ∈BO+. If the zero
solution of the second compound equation

(7.23)
is exponentially stable, then the solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.12) is asymptotically orbitally
stable.
To investigate the stability of a ﬁxed orbit of (7.12) it sufﬁces to consider stability
properties of the projected ﬂow of system (7.12) orthogonally to the perturbed ﬂow
line. Keeping this in mind the following result from [15] on the reparametrization
of solutions of (7.12) in the neighborhood of a ﬁxed solution is of great importance.
We formulate this result under slightly weaker assumptions (see [21, 26]).
Lemma 7.8 Suppose ϕ(·)(p) with p ∈M to be a non-constant solution of (7.12)
with bounded positive semi-orbit γ+(p) such that for a certain C0 > 0 the inequality
|F(u)| > C0 is satisﬁed for all u ∈γ+(p). Then it holds:
(a) For any ﬁnite time T0 > 0 there exists a δ = δ(T0) > 0 such that for any pair
(r, υ) ∈[0, δ] × (T ⊥(p) ∩B(Op, 1)) we may ﬁnd a Cl−1-diffeomorphism (for l = 1
a homeomorphism) s(·,r, υ) : R+ →R+ with s(t, 0, υ) = t for all t ∈R+ and such
that near γ+(p) the reparameterized ﬂow φ(t,r, υ) := ϕs(t,r,υ)(expp(rυ)) of (7.12)
satisﬁes the condition
(D2φ(t,r, υ), F(φ(t,r, υ))) = 0
(7.24)
for all t ∈[0, T0]. (Here D2φ(t,r, υ) stands for the derivative of φ with respect to
the second argument.)
(b) Suppose that the zero solution of the equation in normal variations (7.17) (with
respect to the solution ϕ(·)(p)) is exponentially stable. Then there exist numbers δ > 0
and C > 0 such that for every u = u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ) := expp(B(Op, δ) ∩T ⊥(p)),
parameterized in the above sense, a homeomorphism s(·,r, υ) : R+ →R+ can be
found which satisﬁes
ρ(ϕs(t,r,υ)(u(r, υ)), ϕt(p)) ≤Cρ (u(r, υ), p)
for all t ≥0.
(7.25)
Proof (a) Let υ ∈B⊥(p, 1) be arbitrary. We seek a familiy of parametrizations
s(·, ·, υ) such that the derivative w.r.t. r of φ(t,r, υ) in an arbitrary point ϕs(t,r,υ)
(u(r, υ)) is a vector which belongs to T ⊥(ϕs(t,r,υ)(u(r, υ))). This means that (7.24)
has to be satisﬁed. Suppose that f i and φ j are the local coordinates of F and φ,
respectively, in a chart x around the point φ(t,r, υ). Then D2φ(t,r, υ) has the local
representation
dφi
dr = f i ∂s
∂r + ∂φi
∂r .
It follows that
D2φ = F(ϕs(t,r,υ)(u(r, υ))∂s
∂r + duϕs(t,r,υ)τ u
p(υ) .
(7.26)

If we compare the right-hand side of (7.27) with the deﬁnition (7.19) of the
function μ(·) computed also with respect to ϕ(·)(u(r, υ)), we conclude that μ = −∂s
∂r .
Together with (7.16) and (7.26) we get
D2φ(t,r, υ) = z(s(t,r, υ)τ u

(7.17), computed w.r.t. the curve t →ϕ(t)(u(r, υ)), and satisfying z(0, τ u

Additionally we have ∂s
∂r ∈Cl−1. It was shown in [15] that s(·,r, υ) is strongly
monotone increasing.
(b) Since γ+(p) belongs to an open bounded set U ⊂M there exists an ε0 > 0
such that exp−1
u is for any u ∈γ+(u) a diffeomorphism on B(u, ε0). From part (a) and
from the boundedness of γ+(p) it follows that for any ﬁnite but ﬁxed T0 > 0 there
exists a δ > 0 such that the parametrization s(·, ·, υ) is deﬁned on [0, T0] × [0, δ] for
all u ∈γ+(p) and υ ∈B⊥(u, 1). At the next step we extend the existence interval
[0, T0] for the parametrization. Since the right-hand side of (7.27) is Ck−1-smooth
we see that ∂s
∂r (·, ·, ·) is also Ck−1 w.r.t. all arguments. It follows that

For an arbitrary u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ1) with arbitrary r ∈[0, δ] and υ ∈S⊥(0) we
consider the solution z(·, τ u
p(υ)) of (7.17) w.r.t. the integral curve t →ϕt(u(r, υ)).

where t ∈[0, T0] is arbitrary, and z(·) is the solution of (7.17) w.r.t. the curve t ↔
ϕt(p) and with initial state z(0) = υ. Because of inf |F(u)| > 0 u ∈γ+(u) and the
deﬁnition of the linear operator A we have supu∈U |A(u)| < ∞. Together with (7.29)
and (7.30) this gives

(7.31)
for all t ∈[0, T0] and u (r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ). (Note that norms are computed in different
tangent spaces.) Using (7.28) and (7.31) we get for the length of the curve c : r →

l(c) =

(7.32)
Here u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ) and t ∈[0, T0] are arbitrary and s := s(t,r, υ),u :=
u(r, υ). By assumption the trivial solution of (7.17), is uniformly Lyapunov sta-
ble. It follows that there exists a constant C0 > 0 with |z(t)| ≤C0 for all t ≥0. By
deﬁnition of the geodesic distance we have ρ(φ(t,r, υ), ϕt(p)) ≤l(c). Thus (7.32)
implies that
ρ(φ(t,r, υ), ϕt(p)) ≤C0r(1 + 0(r)) .
(7.33)
Therefore, we can ﬁnd a δ0 ∈[0, δ] such that
ρ(φ(t,r, υ), ϕt(p)) < δ
(7.34)
for all t ∈[0, T0] and all r ∈[0, δ0]. After choosing T0 and δ we can continue the
parametrization onto the interval [0, 2 T0]. Since the bound in (7.34) does not depend
on the time, we can derive the existence of a parametrization s(t,r, υ) for all t ≥0.
With r = ρ(u(r, υ), p) and ρ(φ(t,r, υ), ϕt(p)) ≤l(c) we get directly from (7.33)
that with an appropriate constant C > C0
d(φ(t,r, υ), ϕt(p)) ≤Cρ(u(r, υ), p)
for all t ≥0 and all u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ0) .
□
Remark 7.6 ([11]) It follows from the construction in Lemma 7.8 that under the
condition infu∈M|F(u)| > 0 there exists (see Sect. A.10, Appendix A) a unique
foliation F of M of the codimension 1 for which F is a section in the normal
bundle T (F)⊥. The leaf L of this foliation which contains the point p is a local
transversal section of f in p. In order to see this we consider the (n −1)-dimensional
submanifold of M given by W := {ϕs(0,r,υ)(u(r, υ)) | u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ)}.
The normal bundle of W contains the vectors of the vector ﬁeld F|W. It follows
that W is part of the leaf L of the foliation F which contains the point p.
The differential equation (7.13) is a special local version of the system (7.14). The
reparametrization generates a linear local ﬂow φ : U →E, which is deﬁned on an
open neighborhood U of [0, T ] × (E ∩Tγ (p)M) in R × E. For any pairs (t, (w, z))
with t ∈[0, T ], w ∈W and z ∈Ew this ﬂow is deﬁned as follows: Any point w ∈
W we can associate uniquely to a point uw ∈B⊥(p, δ) which is deﬁned by uw =
expp(rwυw) with rw ∈[0, δ) and υw ∈Ep, |υw|Ep = 1 such that w = φ(0,rw, υw).
For this point the reparametrization through uw is deﬁned. Now we introduce the map

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
333
h : W →[0, δ) × ∂B⊥(0p, 1) that for any w ∈W is given by h(w) := (rw, υw). For
any t ∈[0, T ] we deﬁne the map Pt : W →M through
Pt(w) := φ(t, h(w)) ,
∀w ∈W.
Now the local ﬂow φ is given for all t ∈[0, T ], w ∈W, z ∈Ew by
φ(t, (w, z)) := dw Ptz .
For any time t ∈[0, T ] we consider the (n −1)- dimensional submanifold of M
deﬁned by
Wt := {ϕs(t,r,υ)(u(r, υ)) | u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, ε)}.
Because of (7.24) this submanifold is part of a leaf F of the foliation. For any point
w ∈W we have the relation
dw PtTpW = Tpt(w)Wt .
In particular this means that φ(t, (w, ·)) maps the vectors z ∈Ew into Ept(w). The
result of the reparametrization is indeed a linear local ﬂow on the subbundle E.
Note that relation (7.25) establishes the orbital stability of ϕ(·)(p) (Fig.7.1). It
remains to prove the asymptotic properties.
Remark 7.7 If under the assumptions of Theorem 7.2 the ω-limit set ω(p) of p does
not contain equilibrium points of the vector ﬁeld (7.12) one can show (see Theorem
7.10), using the asymptotic orbital stability properties, that ω(p) is a periodic orbit
which is asymptotically stable and nearby solution paths have asymptotic phases.
For M = Rn this is done in [15, 24]; for the cylinder it is demonstrated in [20, 23].
Proof of Theorem 7.2. For a given solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.12) which is contained in
the set U = U(p) we consider separately the following two cases.
Case1: There exists a sequence {ti}i∈N, ti ≥0 and limi→+∞ti = ∞such that
lim
i→+∞|F(ϕti(p))| = 0
holds.
Case2:
inf
u∈U
|F(u)| > 0.
(7.35)
First we will discuss Case 1. Since γ+(p) ⊂U is bounded the sequence {ϕti(p)}
has a convergent subsequence.

334
7
Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
Without loss of generality we can assume that there exists a point u∗∈U such
that
lim
i→+∞ρ (ϕti(p), u∗) = 0.
(7.36)
It follows that F(u∗) = Ou∗and by the assumption on U we know that u∗is an
asymptotically stable equilibrium point of system (7.12). Thus we ﬁnd an open
neighborhood V(u∗) of u∗such that any positive semi-orbit through u ∈V(u∗) is
attracted by u∗. On account of (7.36) there exists k ∈N such that ϕtk(p) ∈V(u∗),
so we obtain ρ(ϕt(p), u∗) →0 for t →+∞and also that points of a sufﬁciently
small neighborhood of p are attracted by u∗as well. But this implies the asymptotic
stability of γ (p).
The proof in the Case 2 needs more work. For the sake of clearness we divide this
proof into four steps.
Step 1. Using the exponential stability of the zero solution of the second compound
equation (7.23) we deduce the exponential stability of the zero solution of (7.17). By
the assumption of the theorem there exist positive numbers δ0, a and C such that for
any s ≥0
|w(t)| ≤C|w(s)|e−a(t−s)
(7.37)
holds for an arbitrary solution w(·) of (7.23) satisfying |w(s)| < δ0 and all
t ≥s. We consider an arbitrary solution y(·) of the variational equation (7.13) with
y(0) ̸= Op and |y(0) ∧F(p)| < δ0. Let z(·) be the solution of the system (7.17) cou-
pled with y(·) in the sense that y(t) = z(t) + μ(t)F(ϕt(p)), where the factor μ(·)
is determined by (7.19). In addition, suppose y(0) to be such that z(0) ̸= Op. As
mentioned above F(ϕ(·)(p)) is a solution of (7.13). Thus, w(·) := y(·) ∧F(ϕ(·)(p))
is a solution of (7.23) and by means of the fundamental operator solution Y ∧2 of
Fig. 7.1 Reparametrization of the ﬂow

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
335
(7.23) can be written in the form w(t) = Y ∧2(t)[y(0) ∧F(p)]. This gives
|w(t)| = |z(t)| · |F(ϕt(p))|
(7.38)
for all t ≥0 and |w(0)| ̸= 0.
The assumed boundedness of γ+(p) and the inequality (7.35) imply that there is
a constant C1 > 0 such that
sup
u,u′∈γ+(p)
|F(u)|
|F(u′)| < C1,
(7.39)
where the norms are taken in the corresponding tangent spaces. Using (7.37) – (7.39)
we derive
|z(t)| ≤CC1|z(s)|e−a(t−s)
(7.40)
for an arbitrary solution z(·) of (7.17) with 0 < |z(s)| < δ0/|F(p)| and for all t ≥s.
Step 2. Utilizing the exponential stability of the zero solution of the system
in normal variations we deduce the orbital stability of the reference orbit by a
reparametrization of the semi-ﬂow near this orbit. Further we investigate some prop-
erties of this reparametrization, which will be used in Step 3. Consider again γ+(p)
and an arbitrary point u ∈M in the (n −1)-dimensional submanifold B⊥(p, Δ)
through p. As indicated above, u can be uniquely represented by a pair (r, υ)
due to u(r, υ) = expp(rυ). Under the assumptions of the theorem and with (7.40)
all requirements of the part (b) of the Lemma 7.8 are fulﬁlled. This yields the
existence of a number δp ∈(0, Δ) such that for all solutions ϕ(·)(u(r, υ)) with
u(r, υ) = expp(rυ) ∈B⊥(p, δp) there is a reparametrization s(·,r, υ) : R+ →R+
for which (7.25) is satisﬁed. As it was mentioned above from (7.25) the orbital
stability follows.
Step 3. From (7.25) we see that γ (p) is stable. Let ε > 0 be ﬁxed and choose δ ∈
(0, δp) so that for every u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ) the corresponding solution stays in the ε-
neighbourhood γ+(p) for t ≥0. Then, from the construction of the parametrization,
we have for arbitrary u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ) and arbitrary t ≥0 that there exist r =
r(t) ∈[0, ε) and υ = υ(t) ∈T ⊥(ϕt(p)) such that
s(t,r, υ) = s(0,r,υ).

Put V := U ∪%

fact, (7.42) and (7.43) imply that
|z(s(t,r, υ), τ u

(7.44)
holds for any u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ) and all t ≥0 in tangent space Tϕs(u)M.
Step 4. Let us ﬁx now a time t ≥0 and υ ∈T ⊥(p) with |υ| = 1 and consider the
Cl-curve β(·) := φ(t, ·, υ) on M and the lifted curve w(·) := exp−1
ϕt(p)(φ(t, ·, υ))
in the tangent bundle. By the properties of the exponential map for any r ∈[0, δ)
the tangent vectors β′(r) = D2φ(t,r, υ) ∈Tβ(r)M and w′(r) ∈Tϕt(p)M are related
by parallel transport between the tangent spaces, i.e. w′(r) = τ ϕt(p)
β(r) (β′(r)). Thus,
relations (7.28), (7.43), (7.44) and the fact that exp−1

| exp−1
ϕt(p)(φ(t,r, υ))| →0 for t →+∞for arbitrary u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ). Since by

ϕt(p)(φ(t,r, υ))|
holds for all t ≥0 and since from the validity of relation (7.25) we have the stability
of the orbit γ (p), the convergence of | exp−1
ϕt(p)(φ(t,r, υ))| to zero establishes the
asymptotic stability of γ (p).
Using the property of Lyapunov instability we can now formulate the following.
Corollary 7.1 Consider equation (7.12) and p ∈M. Then holds:
(a) If γ (p) ∈BO+ and the zero solution of the system (7.17) with A from (7.18)
is exponentially stable, then the orbit γ (p) is asymptotically stable.
(b) If ϕ(·)(p) is a periodic solution of (7.12) and the zero solution of (7.17) is
Lyapunov unstable, then the orbit γ (p) is unstable.
Proof From the proof of Theorem 7.2 the part (a) of this corollary follows directly.
Let us prove the part (b). Using assertion (a) of Lemma 7.8 we ﬁnd a number
ε > 0 such that the bundle of parametrizations s(·, ·, ·) : R+ × [0, ε] × T ⊥(p) ∩
B(Op, 1)) →R+ exists. Let δ > 0 be chosen as in the proof of Theorem 7.2 and
let S0 :=

ϕ(s(0,r, υ), u)|u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, δ)

be the orthogonal section of γ (p)
through p. For 0 < ε0 < min(ε, δ) we consider (n −1)-dimensional submanifolds
U := {ϕ(s(0,r, υ), u)|u = u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, ε0)}
and
V := {ϕ(s(T,r, υ), u)|u =
u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, ε0)} of M. Obviously p ∈U and U ⊂S0. Using the periodicity of
ϕ(·)(p) we further have p ∈V and with the relationship (7.24) for the reparametrized
ﬂow φ(t,r, υ) as deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 7.2 φ(T,r, υ) ∈S0 for all u ∈U.
This implies V ⊂S0.
We now introduce the injective map h : U →B⊥(0, ε0) given by h(u) = (r, υ)
and deﬁne a Poincaré map P : U →V for γ (p) with respect to the orthogonal section
S0 by
P(u) = φ(T, h(u)).
The properties of the parametrization s(·, ·, ·) guarantee that P is indeed a Poincaré
map. By construction it follows for the differential of P at p
dp P = Z(T, p),
(7.46)

338
7
Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
where Z(T, p) : T ⊥(p) →T ⊥(p) denotes the fundamental operator solution of
(7.17) at time t = T. The assumption of the corollary is equivalent to the existence
of an unbounded solution of system (7.17), say, z(·). We start from the contrary and
suppose that γ (p) is stable. Then we ﬁnd an open set U0 ⊂U ∩V such that all iterates
Pk, k ∈N, of the Poincaré map P : U →V exist on U0. For sufﬁciently small δ0 > 0
we introduce the map h0 : B⊥(p, δ) →U0 given by h0(u(r, υ)) := φ(0,r, υ). Then
by the properties of the parametrization s(·, ·, ·) this map is a diffeomorphism. We
introduce further a map qk : [0, δ) →TpS0 = T ⊥(p) given by
qk(r) := exp−1
p (Pk(h0(u(r, υ)))),
where r ∈[0, δ) and υ ∈T ⊥(p), |υ| = 1, are such that u = u(r, υ) = expp(rυ).
Using Taylor’s formula and qk(0) = 0TpS we obtain
|qk(r)| = |q′
k(0) + o(r)|r = (|q′
k(0)| + o(r))r.
By deﬁnition it holds q′
k(0) = dp Pk ∂
∂r h0(u(r, υ))|r=0. With
∂
∂r h0(u(r, υ))|r=0 =
D2φ(0, 0, υ) = υ we have q′
k(0) = Tp Pkυ. Thus
|qk(r)| = (|dp Pkυ| + o(r))r,
for arbitrary k ∈N. Take now r ∈[0, δ) ﬁxed and υ := z(0). Using the abbreviation
u := h0(u(r, υ)) we get with (7.46)
|qk(r)| = (|z(kT )| + o(r))r.
But the solution z(·) of (7.17) is unbounded, therefore the last contradicts the assumed
stability of γ (p).
□
Remark 7.8 For a T -periodic orbit γ (p) the n −1 multipliers different from the
one which is the eigenvalue corresponding to F(p) coincide with the eigenvalues
of the fundamental operator solution Z(T, p) : T ⊥
p M →T ⊥
p M. Obviously, in this
case the assumption of the ﬁrst part of Corollary 7.1 is an equivalent formulation of
the Andronov-Vitt condition [2, 6].
We now propose a condition [21] sufﬁcient for the exponential stability of the zero
solution of (7.17). For any u ∈M denote by λ1(u) ≥· · · ≥λn(u) the eigenvalues
of the symmetric part of the covariant derivative S∇F(u) ordered with respect to
their size and multiplicity.

then the orbit γ (p) is asymptotically stable.
Proof We distinguish between the case where the orbit is attracted by an equilibrium
pointinU andthecasewhereitisnot,andhandletheﬁrstcasecompletelyanalogously
as in the proof of Theorem 7.2. In the other case, where relation (7.35) is valid, the
ﬁrst steps are also similar to the proof of Theorem 7.2. Consider the solution w(·) :=
y(·) ∧F(ϕ(·)(p)) of (7.23), where y(·) is a solution of (7.13) with |y(0) ∧F(p)| ̸= 0
and with properties as in the proof of Theorem 7.2. Let us couple y(·) with a solution
z(·) of (7.17) by means of z(t) = y(t) + μ(t)F(ϕt(p)). Then we have already shown
that |w(t)| = |z(t)| · |F(ϕt(p))| > 0 for t ≥0. A straightforward calculation shows
that for all t ≥0
d

derivative with respect to the new metric tensor) are λi = λi + ˙V
2 , i = 1, 2, . . . , n ,
where ˙V ≡LFV is the Lie derivative of V in direction of the vector ﬁeld F. Thus
λ1 +λ2 = λ1 + λ2 + ˙V . It follows that the condition
$ T
0
[λ1(ϕt(p)) + λ2(ϕt(p)) + ˙V (ϕt(p))]dt < 0
is sufﬁcient for the asymptotic stability of the T -periodic orbit γ (p). The last condi-
tion is often used for M = Rn in investigations with Lyapunov functions of orbital
or Zhukovskii stability of periodic solutions (see [19, 32]).
Example 7.3 Consider the equation
˙u = f (u)
(7.52)
with a Cl-vector ﬁeld f : Rn →Rn(l > 1). Suppose that the ﬂow ϕ(·)(·) : R ×
Rn →Rn of (7.52) exists. We introduce the subgroup of Rn
Γ :=
 m

i=1
kidi|ki ∈Z

,
(7.53)
where m ≤n, {di}m
i=1 are linearly independent vectors in Rn. The vector ﬁeld (7.52) is
supposed to have the property f (u + ϑ) = f (u) for every ϑ ∈Γ and every u ∈Rn.
In this case system (7.52) is called pendulum-like with respect to Γ [23].
Note that a broad class of differential equations with angular coordinates in
mechanics, phase-synchronization and other ﬁelds can be considered as pendulum-

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds

like systems. For the ﬂow of (7.52) we have then the equivariance propery ϕt(u +
ϑ) = ϕt(u) + ϑ for every u ∈Rn, t ∈R and ϑ ∈Γ . Therefore, system (7.52) can
be interpreted as vector ﬁeld F on the ﬂat cylinder Rn/Γ (m < n) or on the ﬂat torus
(m = n), respectively (see Sect. A.1, Appendix A).
A solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.52) is called a cycle of the second kind if there exists a
number T > 0 and some ϑ ∈Γ \{0}, such that ϕT (p) = p + ϑ. We call the minimal
positive number T with this property the period of ϕ(·)(p). Note that any cycle of the
second kind of (7.52) becomes closed for the vector ﬁeld F on the cylinder or torus.
We will now consider a system (7.52) in R2 of the form
˙x1 = a sin x1 + b,
˙x2 = −x2
(7.54)
with parameters b > a > 1. Since the right-hand side f of (7.54) is 2π-periodic with
respect to the coordinate x1, the system can be interpreted as vector ﬁeld on the ﬂat
cylinder R2/Γ with respect to the subgroup Γ := {k(2π, 0)|k ∈Z} of R2.
On account of the assumption b > a the circle {(x1, 0)|x1 mod 2π} coincides with
a closed orbit of system (7.54) on R2/Γ , which we denote by γ . Consider a solution
ϕ(·) of (7.54) which corresponds to γ . Then ϕ(·) is of the form ϕ(t) = (x1(t), 0).
The variational system (7.13) with respect to ϕ(·) is given by
˙y1 = a cos x1 · y1,
˙y2 = −y2.
(7.55)
Since f (ϕ(t)) = (a sin x1(t) + b, 0), the vectors in T ⊥((x1, 0)) are of the form z =
(0, x) with x ∈R. Observe that the differential equations in system (7.54) for the
tangent and the orthogonal directions are not coupled along γ . Thus, the restriction
of system (7.17) to T ⊥((x1(t), 0)) can simply be written as differential equation for
x, given by
˙x = −x .
(7.56)
It is obvious that the trivial solution of the system in normal variations (7.56) is
exponentially stable and Corollary 7.1 provides that the orbit γ is asymptotically
stable.

The geodesic ﬂow is given by the map φ : R × T M →T M with φ(t, (p, υ)) =
˙cp,υ(t). We use the notation φt(p, υ) ≡φ(t, (p, υ)). System (7.58) is equivalent to
the ﬁrst order system (7.12) on the product manifold M × T M given by
˙u = υ ,
˙υ = G (u, υ),
(7.59)
where G : M × T M →T T M is determined in local coordinates of the chart x
through (7.58) by ˙υi = −Γ i
jkυ jυk and υ j are the coordinates of υ.
The tangent space TυT M at any υ ∈TpM is isomorphic to TpM × TpM, so that
w ∈TυT M can be identiﬁed with a pair (w1, w2) ∈TpM × TpM. Now we con-
sider the splitting of w ∈TυT M into parts dπ(w) and Cw, where dπ : TυT M →
TpM denotes the differential of the projection map π : T M →M, π((p, υ)) = p,
deﬁned by dπ(w) = w1 and C denotes the connection map given in local coordinates
of some chart x around p by (Cw)i = wi

A Jacobi ﬁeld y(·) : t →Tc(t)M along a geodesic c(t) is a solution of the Jacobi
equation

(7.60)
where K(t)υ = R(υ, ˙c(t))˙c(t) and R denotes the Riemannian curvature tensor
(see Sect. A.9, Appendix A). If we identify the differential dp,υφt : TυT M →
Tφt(p,υ)T M at any w ∈TυT M with the pair (dπ(dp,υφtw), Cdp,υφtw) then the
Jacobi equation, written as a ﬁrst order system on T M × T M, is the variational
system (7.13) with respect to an integral curve (cp,υ(·), φ(·)(p, υ)) of system (7.60)
(see [7, 16, 30]).
Let y(·) be a Jacobi ﬁeld along some geodesic c(·). Then y(·) can be split into a
tangent part yT in direction of ˙c and a part y⊥= y −yT ∈T ⊥(c(t)). Both yT (·) and
y⊥(·) are Jacobi ﬁelds along c(·) and further D2yT
dt2
= 0 (see [16]) and ( Dy⊥
dt , ˙c) = 0.
This gives that the integral curve
z(t) = (z1(t), z2(t)) := (y⊥(t), Dy⊥
dt (t))
is the solution of the system in normal variations (7.17) of system (7.60) with respect
to (cp,υ(·), φ(·)(p, υ))

Now we want to investigate the stability behaviour of closed geodesics using
Corollary 7.1. On the base of our general criterion we show the orbital instability of
closed geodesics on negatively curved manifolds, which is of course not surprising
because of the hyperbolic and expansive character of such a geodesic ﬂow [7, 30].
Sincethegeodesics arecurves of constant velocitywecanrestrict our investigation

TuM, |υ| = 1}. Let SuM denote the unit tangent space at the point u ∈M. Fix an
arbitrary geodesic cp,υ(·) with initial velocity υ ∈Sp.
Let us indicate that an appropriate way to write system (7.61) in the bundle of
transversal sections is to use Fermi coordinates along cp,υ(·). This means to take
an orthonormal base {ei(0)}n−1
i=1 of T ⊥(cp,υ(0)) and to generate an orthonormal base
{ei(t)}n−1
i=1 in T ⊥(cp,υ(t)) by parallel transport along cp,υ(·). To deﬁne a base in
Tcp,υ(t)M the tupel {ei(t)}n−1
i=1 is accomplished by ˙cp,υ(t) for any time t ∈R. The
construction implies that Dei
dt = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n −1.
An arbitrary Jacobi ﬁeld with initial condition in T ⊥(υ) × T ⊥(υ) can be written as
y(t) = νi(t)ei(t)withCm−1-functionsνi : R →Randweobtain Dy
dt (t) = ˙νi(t)ei(t)
and D2y
dt2 (t) = ¨νiei(t). Hence, replacing the expressions in (7.61) leads to
¨νi + K i
jν j = 0,
(7.62)
where K i
j := (R(ei, ˙c)˙c, e j). We deﬁne in TυT M the norm
|w| =
!
|dπ(w)|Tp M + |Cw|Tp M.
Suppose now that the sectional curvature on M is negative, say, bounded by a
constant −k2 < 0. Note, that for υ ∈SpM and any Jacobi ﬁeld y(·) along cp,υ(·)
holds
(K(t)y(t), y(t)) ≤−k2(y(t), y(t))
for all t ≥0. Let Kδ denote the cone, generated by all vectors z ∈T T M written
as z = (z1, z2) = (dπ(z), Cz) which satisfy
(z1,z2)Tp M
|z|
≥δ. A result from [16] says,
that in this situation any such cone Kδ is invariant if δ > 0 is sufﬁciently small and
further, that there exists a constant ε0 > 0, for which each solution z(·) of (7.61) with
z(0) ∈Kδ satisﬁes
d
dt |z(t)| > ε0|z(t)|.
This implies |z(t)| ≥|z(0)|eε0t for t ≥0 and establishes the Lyapunov instability
of the trivial solution z ≡0TυT M of (7.61). Finally, the application of the second
part of Corollary 7.1, (b) provides that all periodic solutions (cp,υ(·), φ(·)(p, υ)) are
orbitally unstable and, therefore, all closed geodesics with unit speed are orbitally
unstable.
7.2.4
Characteristic Exponents
Let us consider again on the Riemannian manifold (M, g) the vector ﬁeld f : M →
T M generating (7.12) and the associated variational equation (7.13) along a solution

u ∈M and an arbitrary vector υ ∈TuM, υ ̸= 0TuM, the number
χ(u, υ) = lim sup
t→∞
1
t ln |Y(t, u)υ|
(7.63)
is called the characteristic exponent of (7.12) (or of the ﬂow {ϕ(·)(p)t}) at u ∈M in
direction υ (see e.g. [30]). Furthermore, we need for k = 1, . . . , n the singular values
of Y ∧k(t, u), i.e., the square roots of the eigenvalues of the positive deﬁnite linear
operator (Y ∧k(t, u))∗Y ∧k(t, u) :  k TuM → k TuM. These singular values we
denote by α(k)
1 (t, u) ≥. . . ≥α(k)
( n
k )(t, u), whereas for the singular values of Y(t, u)
we simply write α1(t, u) ≥. . . ≥αn(t, u).
We continue by listing some well-known properties of the characteristic exponents
(see [29, 30] and, for the case of Rn, [4]).
Lemma 7.9 Let u ∈M be some point such that the corresponding semi-orbit γ+(u)
of (7.12) is bounded. Then the following holds:
(1) −∞< χ(u, υ) < ∞,
for all υ ∈TuM with υ ̸= 0TuM;
(2) χ(u, ·) possesses at most n different values, which we denote by χ1(u) > . . . >
χN(u)(u) according to size, where 0 < N(u) ≤n;
(3) provided that in a neighborhood of γ+(u) no equilibrium point of (7.12) is
contained, then at least one value χi(u) vanishes.
Proof Here we only give a proof of 3) in order to show brieﬂy in which direction the
characteristic exponent is equal to zero. It appears that in the vector ﬁeld direction
f (u) at u ∈M the characteristic exponent always vanishes. Indeed, by the assump-
tion that γ+(u) ⊂U for some open bounded set U ⊂M there exists a constant C > 0
such that supp∈U | f (p)| < C holds and since f (ϕ(·)(p)(·, u)) is a solution of (7.13)
by deﬁnition (7.63) we have
χ(u, f (u)) = lim sup
t→∞
1
t ln | f (ϕ(·)(p)t(u))| ≤lim
t→∞
1
t ln C = 0.
Since the additional assumption of 3) implies inft≥0 | f (ϕ(·)(p)t(u))| > 0, we obtain
by an analogous argumentation that χ(u, f (u)) ≥0.
□
We call χ1(u) > . . . > χN(u)(u) the characteristic exponents of (7.12) in u (or of
the semi-orbit γ+(u).)
Moreingeneral,foranarbitraryu ∈M,k = 1, . . . , n andarbitraryw ∈ k TuM
we deﬁne the characteristic exponents of (7.12) of order k at u ∈M in direction
w ̸= 0 k TuM (see [29]) by
χ(k)(u, w) = lim sup
t→∞
1
t ln |Y ∧k(t, u)w|.
(7.64)

Obviously, the above deﬁnition (7.63) coincides with (7.64) for the case k = 1, so
χi(u, υ) = χ(1)
i
(u, υ) are, in fact, the characteristic exponents of ﬁrst order. From
Lemma 7.9 we obtain analogous properties 1) and 2) for the characteristic exponents
of k-th order. This is due to the fact that we only replace the operator solution Y(t, u)
of (7.13) normed at t = 0 operating in the n-dimensional linear space Tϕ(·)(p)t(u)M
by the operator solution Y ∧k(t, u) of (7.21) normed at t = 0 operating in the linear

, and call them characteristic
exponents of (7.12) of order k at u (or of the semi-orbit γ+(u)). In particular, for k = n,
there is exactly one value χ(n)(u, w) = χ(n)
1 (u) for any nonzero w ∈ n TuM and
by deﬁnition (7.64) we have
χ(n)
1 (u) = lim sup
t→∞
1
t ln |det Y(t, u)|.
(7.65)
The next lemma indicates the relationship between the characteristic exponents
of order k and the singular values of Y ∧k(t, u), which will prove later to be of great
importance in analyzing the stability behavior of the underlying dynamical system.

(2) for all nonzero w = w1 ∧. . . ∧wk ∈ k TuM holds
χ(k)(u, w) ≤χ(u, w1) + · · · + χ(u, wk).
(7.66)
Proof We prove assertion (1) for k = 1. ( For arbitrary k one proceeds analogously.)
Let {yi} be an orthonormal base with respect to (·, ·)TuM of TuM. Since χ1(u) is the
largest characteristic exponent at u in any direction the relation
χ(u, yi) ≤χ1(u)
(7.67)
is valid for each i ∈{1, . . . , n}. Let us for any t ≥0 denote by υ1(t) an eigenvector of
Y(t, u)∗Y(t, u) corresponding to the eigenvalue α2
1(t, u), normalized by |υ1(t)| = 1.
Then there exist functions ai(t) such that
υ1(t) =
n

i=1
ai(t)yi
and, consequently, |ai(t)| ≤1 for all t ≥0. Since
α1(t, u) = |Y(t, u)υ1(t)| ≤
n

i=1
|ai(t)||Y(t, u)yi|,

we ﬁnd for any t ≥0 an index k = k(t) ∈{1, . . . , n} such that
|Y(t, u)yk| ≥1
n α1(t, u).
(7.68)
It follows that for any sequence ti →∞there is a subsequence which we also denote
by {ti}i and a ﬁxed index j ∈{1, . . . , n} such that
|Y(ti, u)y j| ≥1
n α1(ti, u)
for i = 1, 2, . . .
(7.69)
is satisﬁed. From this we obtain for all i

ti
ln |Y(ti)y j| ≥1

ln n,
so according to (7.63) and (7.67) we have
χ1(u) ≥χ(u, y j) ≥lim sup
t→∞

t ln α1(t, u).
The opposite inequality is obvious since |Y(t, u)υ| ≤|Y(t, u)| = α1(t, u) holds for
all υ ∈TuM and all times t ≥0. The statement 2) follows immediately from the
fact that the supremum over a sum is always less than or equal to the sum over the
suprema.
□
Now we want to derive some estimates for the characteristic exponents of (7.12)
at u ∈M in terms of the right hand-side of the variational system (7.21), which
will be needed in the sequel. Let k ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrarily chosen and let w(·)
be an arbitrary nonzero solution of (7.21) considered with respect to ϕ(·)(p)(·)(u).
Remembering that |w(t)|2 = (w(t), w(t))) k Tϕ(·)(p)t (u)M we obtain

Orbital Stability Conditions in Terms of Exponents
We come back now to the orbital stability investigation beginning with a criterion
for orbital stability of arbitrary bounded solutions written in terms of characteristic
exponents.
Theorem 7.4 Suppose that for an orbit γ (u) of (7.12) with u ∈W+ the largest
characteristic exponent of order 2 satisﬁes
χ(2)
1 (u) < 0.
Then the orbit γ (u) is asymptotically stable.
Proof The assumptions of the theorem and statement 1) of Lemma 7.10 provide that
for sufﬁciently large t > 0
1
t ln α(2)
1 (t, u) ≤−κ < 0,
(7.74)
where for brevity κ := −χ(2)
1 (u). Therefore
|Y ∧2(t, u)| = α(2)
1 (t, u) ≤e−κt

348

Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
holds for sufﬁciently large t > 0. This yields that the trivial solution of (7.23) is
asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov and Theorem 7.2 can be applied. □
Remark 7.10 Consider now a T -periodic orbit γ (u) of system (7.12). It is well-
known that the Lyapunov exponents ν of an invariant measure concentrated an γ (u)
are related to the multipliers ρi by (see e.g. [8])
ν(u) = 1
T ln |ρi(u)|,
i = 1, . . . , n.
(7.75)
This conﬁrms incidently that one of them is equal to zero. On account of the
Andronov-Witt theorem we conclude that if λ1(u) = 0 and λ2(u) < 0 then the orbit
is asymptotically stable.
For completeness we formulate an orbital stability result that was proved in [27].
One easily checks that the second statement of this theorem is simply the appropriate
formulation of Theorem 7.3 for the case of a periodic orbit.
Theorem 7.5 Let γ (u) be a T -periodic orbit of system (7.12). Let λ1(·) ≥λ2(·) be
the largest two eigenvalues of S∇f (·). Suppose that one of the conditions
(1) ρ2(u) < 1,

7.2.6
Estimating the Singular Values and Orbital Stability
In this subsection we continue studying the fundamental operator solution Y(t, p)
of the variational system (7.13) along a solution ϕt(p) of (7.12) on the manifold
(M, g). In order to use Lyapunov-type functions for upper and lower estimates of
the singular values of the fundamental operator solution of (7.13) we introduce some
formal assumptions. In the next subsection it will be shown that frequency-domain
conditions for feedback-control systems on the cylinder may effectively generate
such type of assumptions.
Let H be a map from an open and bounded set 
U ⊂M into the space of linear
operators in tangent space such that
(H1)
H(u) : TuM →TuM is a linear operator depending Cm−1-smoothly on
u and satisfying H ∗(u) = H(u) for every u ∈
U.
Further we will suppose that H has one of the following properties:
(H2a) H(u) has for any u ∈
U at least k (1 ≤k ≤n) negative eigenvalues.
(H2b) H(u) has for any u ∈
U at least k (1 ≤k ≤n) positive eigenvalues.

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
349
We put ΩH(u) := {υ ∈TuM | (υ, H(u)υ) < 0} and
Ω H(u) := {υ ∈TuM | (υ, H(u)υ) > 0} for any u ∈
U.
Consider a solution ϕt(p) of (7.12) and denote the singular values of the funda-
mental operator solution Y(t, p) of the variational system (7.13) by α1(t, p) ≥· · · ≥
αn(t, p).
Proposition 7.17 Let H be a map on the open and bounded set 
U ⊂M with prop-
erties (H1) and (H2a). Let U ⊂M be also open with U ⊂
U and suppose that for the
orbit through p of (7.12) with γ+(p) ⊂U there exists a real function θ : R+ →R
such that
(y(t, υ), H(ϕt(p))∇f (ϕt(p))y(t, υ)) + (y(t, υ), D

for all solutions y(·, υ) of (7.13) with y(0, υ) = υ ∈ΩH(p) and for all such times

Proof Fix an arbitrary υ ∈ΩH(p) and consider the solution y(·, υ) of the variational
system (7.13) with y(0, υ) = υ and the auxiliary function V : R+ →R given by
V (t) := (y(t, υ), H(ϕt(p))y(t, υ)). Obviously, V (0) < 0 holds. By the continuity
of the solution of (7.12) and (7.13) we can argue that there is a time t0 = t0(υ) > 0
such that y(t, υ) ∈ΩH(ϕt(p)) for all t ∈[0, t0]. Therefore inequality (7.76) reads
as
˙V (t) + 2θ(t)V (t) ≤0
for all t ∈[0, t0].

From V (0) < 0 and (7.78) we obtain that the solution y(t, υ) stays inside ΩH(ϕt(p))
for all ﬁnite times t ≥0. This implies that (7.77) as well as (7.78) hold for all t ≥0.
Hence by deﬁnition of V we have

Remark 7.11 The condition of Proposition 7.17 generalizes the eigenvalue con-
dition for the covariant derivative ∇F given with H(u) ≡idTuM in the form
(y(t, υ), ∇F(ϕt(p))y(t, υ)) ≤−θ(t)|y(t, υ)|2 for t ≥0 with respect to the solu-
tions of (7.12) and (7.13). Note, that in case 
U = M for a compact manifold M
property (H1) guarantees that the family of bilinear formsg(u; υ, w) = g(u; υ, Hw)
generates a pseudo Riemannian metric on M and the subspaces L j(u) appearing in
the proof of Proposition 7.17 are constructed in such a way that these bilinear forms
are positive when restricted to L j(u).
Consider now the adjoint to (7.13) variational system
Dy
dt = −∇F∗(ϕt(p))y.
(7.80)
Notice that the fundamental operator solution of (7.80) having the identity at t = 0
is given by Y ∗(−t, u) where Y(t, u) denotes the fundamental operator solution of
the variational system (7.13) satisfying Y(0, p) = idTpM.
Proposition 7.18 Let H be a map on an open and bounded set 
U ⊂M with prop-
erties (H1) and (H2b). Let further U ⊂M be open with U ⊂
U and suppose that for
the orbit through p of (7.12) with γ+(p) ⊂U there exists a real function θ : R →R
such that
(y(t, υ), H(ϕt(p))∇F∗(ϕt(p))y(t, υ)) + (y(t, υ), D

for all solutions y(·, υ) of (7.80) with y(0, υ) = υ ∈Ω H(p) and for all such times

if ∇F is replaced by −∇F∗, H by −H and θ by −θ.
□
In the next lemma we deduce sufﬁcient conditions for the boundedness on R+ of
the largest singular value of the fundamental solution operator of (7.13).
Lemma 7.11 Assume that for an orbit of (7.12) through p the following conditions
are satisﬁed:
(a)
α2(t, p) →0
as
t →+∞.
(7.83)
(b) There exists a solution y1(t, p) of (7.13) and constants C1 and C2 such that
0 < C1 ≤|y1(t, p)| ≤C2 for all t ≥0.
(7.84)
Then α1(t, p) is bounded on [0, +∞).
Proof Suppose the opposite, i.e., suppose that there exists a sequence tk →+∞
for k →+∞such that α1(tk, p) →+∞for k →+∞. It follows that |Y(tk, p)| →
+∞as k →+∞and there exists a solution y2(t, p) of (7.13), satisfying
|y2(tk, p)| →+∞as k →+∞.
(7.85)
Take now the vectors y1(0, p) and y2(0, p) and numbers ε1 > 0, ε2 > 0 to deﬁne
the two-dimensional annular region

αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p) : 0 < ε1 ≤|αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p)|
≤ε2, α, β ∈R

⊂TpM.
(7.86)
We consider a point αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p) from this region (7.86). We ﬁnd a δ =
δ(ε1) > 0 such that with respect to the above sequence {tk} (or possibly with respect
to some subsequence)
|Y(tk, p)(αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p)| = |αy1(tk, p) + βy2(tk, p)| ≥δ
(7.87)
for all k = 1, 2, . . . holds. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that such a δ does not
exist. Then we can assume the existence of bounded sequences of numbers {αk} and
{βk} generating points in the annular region (7.86) and such that
αk y1(tk, p) + βk y2(tk, p) →0 as k →+∞.
(7.88)

Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
Take now convergent subsequences (we use the previous notations) αk →α and
βk →β as k →+∞and consider two cases.
Case1: β = 0. Then it follows from (7.86) that α ̸= 0. But, because of (7.84), this
implies that property (7.88) is impossible.
Case2: β ̸= 0. Passing possibly to a subsequence with (7.85) we conclude that for
some δ > 0 the inequalities
|αy1(tk, p) + βy2(tk, p)| ≥|βy2(tk, p)| −|αy1(tk, p)| ≥δ
hold for all k ∈N. But this contradicts (7.88). This shows that the property (7.87)
is satisﬁed. For an arbitrary t ≥0 let us take an orthonormalized system of vectors
{u j(t, p)}n
j=1 in TpM such that
Y(t, p)∗Y(t, p)u j(t, p) = α2
j(t, p)u j(t, p) ( j = 1, 2, . . . , n).
Then the vectors Y(t, p)u j(t, p), j = 1, . . . , n, are orthogonal in Tϕt(p)M and
|Y(t, p)u j(t, p)| = α j(t, p). Obviously, for any t ≥0 we have the unique represen-
tation
αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p) =
n

j=1
τ j(t, p, α, β)u j(t, p)
with τ j(t, p, α, β) = (αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p), u j(t, p)) , j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus, by
(7.86)
|τ j(t, p, α, β)| ≤|αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p)| ≤ε2
for j = 1, 2, . . . , n and t ≥0.
(7.89)
It follows Y(t, p) (αy1(0, p) + βy2(0, p))
= Y(t, p)

Fig. 7.2 The annular region
holds. But this contradicts the fact that the image under the fundamental operator
Y(t, p) of the annular region (7.86) has property (7.87) for times tk. Further, on the
other side its image under this non-singular linear map is again an annular region as
shown in Fig.7.2.
□
The next theorem contains the main stability result of this section. In Sect. 7.2.7
we will reduce the stability investigation for feedback-control systems on the cylinder
to a situation described in this theorem.
Recall that BO+ denotes the set of all orbits of (7.12) for which there exists an
open bounded set U ⊂M containing γ+(p) and such that any equilibrium of system
(7.12) lying in U is asymptotically stable.
Theorem 7.6 Let γ (p) be an orbit of (7.12) with γ (p) ∈BO+ and U the set con-
taining γ+(p). Suppose that the assumptions of Proposition 7.18 are satisﬁed with
respect to U, k = n −1 and a function θ(·) which satisﬁes inft∈R+ θ(t) > 0. Then
the orbit γ (p) is asymptotically stable.
Proof Since the assumptions of Proposition 7.18 are satisﬁed for k = n −1, we ﬁnd
a constant B > 0 such that

−
t&

θ(τ)dτ
(7.90)
for all t ∈R+ is valid. From this it follows that α2(t, p) →0 for t →+∞and
thus condition (a) of Lemma 7.11 is satisﬁed. The function y1(t, p) = F(ϕt(p))
is a solution of the variational equation (7.13) and the assumption γ (p) ∈BO+
guarantees that y1(·, p) satisﬁes the condition (b) of Lemma 7.11. We conclude
with this lemma that α1(t, p) is bounded on R+. Denote by α(2)
1 (t, p) the largest
singular value of the second multiplicative compound operator Y ∧2(t, p) which is the
fundamental operator solution of the second compound variational equation (7.23).
Since α(2)
1 (t, p) = α1(t, p)α2(t, p) for all t ≥0, α1(·, p) is bounded and α2(·, p)
satisﬁes (7.90), there is a constant C > 0 such that for sufﬁciently large t > 0

Using the assumptions on θ(·) we ﬁnd a constant a > 0 such that
α(2)

for sufﬁciently large t > 0. Since α(2)
1 (t, p) = |Y ∧2(t, p)|, where | · | denotes the
associated operator norm, it follows by the last inequality that the trivial solution of
the equation (7.23) is exponentially stable. Applying now the statement of Theorem
7.2 we obtain the desired result.

7.2.7
Frequency-Domain Conditions for Orbital Stability in
Feedback Control Equations on the Cylinder
We now consider feedback control systems with one scalar nonlinearity and a linear
part written in the form
˙x = Px + qξ,
ξ = φ(w),
w = (r, x),
(7.91)
where P is a real n × n matrix, q and r are real n-vectors and φ : R →R is a
continuously differentiable function. We assume that φ is periodic with some period
Δ > 0, for example a sine-type function φ(w) = sin w −ρ with a constant ρ. In
order to deﬁne with (7.91) a vector ﬁeld on the cylinder we suppose also that there
exists a vector d ∈Rn, d ̸= 0, with Pd = 0 and (r, d) = Δ. Hence we obtain a
system (7.91) which is pendulum-like with respect to the subgroup Γ generated by
the vector d. (See Example 7.3.) It follows that (7.91) can be considered as vector
ﬁeld on the cylinder Rn/Γ . To explore the stability behaviour of solutions of system
(7.91) we use results from the preceeding subsection as well as the solvability of
special matrix inequalities (see Sect. 2.5, Chap. 2). It will not be difﬁcult to verify
conditions (H1) and (H2) for system (7.91).
Here we consider only solutions ϕ(·, x0) of (7.91) with ϕ(0, x0) = x0 and γ (x0) ∈
BO+ on Rn/Γ. One class of such solutions are the circular solutions, i.e., solutions
of (7.91) for which there exist ε > 0 and τ ≥0 such that for w(t) = (r, ϕ(t, x0))
the inequality ˙w(t) ≥0 (or ˙w(t) ≤−ε) is satisﬁed on [τ, ∞). We say that a circular
solution is asymptotically orbitally stable if the corresponding bounded orbit on
Rn/Γ is asymptotically stable.
The variational system (7.13) with respect to a solution ϕ(·, x0) of (7.91) is given
by
˙y =

P + φ′((r, ϕ(t, x0)))qr∗
y.
(7.92)
For brevity we put u(t, x0) := φ′((r, ϕ(t, x0))). Then u(·, x0) is a continuous n-vector
function for ﬁxed x0 and system (7.92) becomes

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
355
˙y = (P + u(t, x0)qr∗)y,
while the adjoint to (7.92) system becomes
˙y = −(P∗+ u(t, x0)rq∗)y.
(7.93)
Let now ϕ(·, x0) be a solution of (7.91) with γ (x0) ∈BO+. We assume that there
are given a Hermitian form F(·, ·) : C × Cn →R, a real n-vector c and a number
ε > 0 such that
F((c, z), z) ≥ε(c, z)2
(7.94)
for all z ∈Rn and
F(u(t, x0)(q, z), z) ≥0
(7.95)
for all t ≥0 and z ∈Rn. We can establish the following result [21].
Theorem 7.7 Consider (7.91) and suppose that the pair (P∗,r) is controllable and
that c is an n-vector such that the pair (P∗, c) is observable. Let γ (x0) ∈BO+ and
suppose that F(ξ, z) is a Hermitian form such that with respect to c and u(t, x0) :=
φ′((r, ϕ(t, x0))) the inequalities (7.94) and (7.95) are satisﬁed. Let κ > 0 be some
number such that the following conditions hold:
(1) The matrix P∗+ rc∗+ κ I has at least n −1 eigenvalues with negative real
part.
(2) F(ξ, [(iω −κ)I −P∗]−1rξ) ≤0 for all ξ ∈C, ω ∈R with
det [(iω −κ)I −P∗] ̸= 0.
Then the solution ϕ(·, x0) is asymptotically orbitally stable.
Proof Because of the controllability of (P∗,r) and the assumption 2) of the theorem
the Yakubovich-Kalman theorem (Theorem 2.7, Chap. 2) guarantees the existence
of a real n × n matrix H = H ∗satisfying
2(H[P∗+ κ I]y + rξ, y) + F(ξ, y) ≤0
for all y ∈Rn and ξ ∈R.
(7.96)
We take, in particular, ξ = (c, y) in (7.96) and use (7.94) to obtain
2(H[P∗+ rc∗+ κ I]y, y) ≤−ε(c, y)2
for all y ∈Rn.
(7.97)
Applying Lemma 2.7, Chap. 2, we see that the observability of the pair (P∗, c),
assumption 1) of the theorem, and (7.97) provide that H has at least n −1 positive
eigenvalues.
If we put ξ = u(t, x0)(q, y) in (7.96) and use the inequality (7.95) we derive from
(7.96)
(H[P∗+ u(t, x0)rq∗]y, y) + κ(Hy, y) ≤0
for all y ∈Rn and t ≥0.

Taking now M = Rn, 
U = U (the bounded set containing γ (x0)) and H(u) ≡H
on U, we see that for H the assumptions (H1) and (H2b) and the inequality (7.81)
with θ(t) ≡κ
2 are satisﬁed. Thus, we can apply Theorem 7.6 to conclude that the
orbit γ (x0) of (7.91) is asymptotically stable.
□
Consider now the transfer function of the linear part of (7.91)
W(z) = r∗(P −zI)−1q,
(7.98)
which is deﬁned for all z ∈C with det(P −zI) ̸= 0. Notice that under our assump-
tion W(·) is a rational function of the form W(z) = R(z)/N(z), where N(z) =
det(zI −P) and R(z) is a polynomial of degree less than n. We say that W(·) is
non-degenerate if the polynomials R(·) and N(·) are coprime. It is well-known that
W(·) is non-degenerate if and only if the pair (P, q) is controllable and the pair
(P,r) is observable (see [35]).
Notice further that W is non-degenerate if and only if W ∗is non-degenerate.
Corollary 7.2 Consider system (7.91) and let γ (x0) ∈BO+. Suppose that the trans-
fer function W(·) of (7.91) is non-degenerate and that there exists a number κ > 0
such that the following conditions are fulﬁlled:
(1) The matrix P∗+ κ I has at least n −1 eigenvalues with negative real part;
(2) There are numbers κ1 < 0 < κ2 such that for u(t, x0) := φ′((r, ϕ(t, x0))) we
have

(q∗y −κ−1

Then condition (2) of the present corollary implies condition (2) of Theorem

sufﬁciently small number such that the matrix P∗+ δrq∗+ κ I, as in condition

A large class of pendulum-like systems can be written in the second canonical
form (see [20, 23]) as

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
357
˙x = Ax + bφ(w),
˙w = (c, x) + b′φ(w),
(7.100)
where A is a real m × m matrix, b and c are real m-vectors, φ(·) is a Δ-periodic
function on R and b′ is a parameter. System (7.100) can easily be brought into
feedback form (7.91) by choosing n = m + 1 and

We conclude that system (7.100) is pendulum-like with respect to the subgroup Γ
which is generated by the vector d = Δr. The transfer function of (7.100) is given by
W(z) = 1/z[(c, (A −zI)−1b) −b′]. In analyzing the stability behaviour of circular
solutions of (7.100), the ﬂat cylinder interpretation makes it possible to apply the
above results. In particular, Corollary 7.2 requires that for a certain κ > 0 the matrix
P∗+ κ I possesses n eigenvalues with negative real part and that the transfer function
W(·) satisﬁes an appropriate frequency-domain condition.
In the sequel we suppose that the nonlinearity φ(w) in system (7.100) does not
have zeros, i.e., φ(w) ̸= 0 for all w ∈R, that the matrix A has only eigenvalues with
negative real part and (c, A−1(b) ̸= b′. In this case it is well-known ([23], p.128)
that there exists a cycle of the second kind and all solutions of system (7.100) are
circular ones. In addition system (7.100) is dissipative in the cylindrical phase space
(see Sect. 1.2, Chap. 1), i.e., there exists a number D such that for any solution
(x(t), w(t)) of (7.100) we have lim sup
t→+∞
|x(t)| ≤D. From this and from Corollary
7.2 we obtain the following:
Proposition 7.19 Suppose that the Δ-periodic nonlinearity φ in (7.100) does not
have zeros and that there exist numbers κ1 < 0 < κ2 such that
κ1 ≤φ′(w) ≤κ2 for all w ∈R.
(7.101)
Suppose further that the transfer function W(·) of (7.100) is non-degenerate,
that there exists a number κ > 0 such that inequality (7.99) is satisﬁed and that
the matrix A + κ I has only eigenvalues with negative real part. Then system
(7.100) has a unique cycle of the second kind, say, ϕ(·, x0) which is asymptoti-
cally orbitally stable and which attracts any other orbit of the system for t →+∞,
i.e., lim
t→+∞dist(ϕ(t, u), γ+(x0)) = 0 for any solutions ϕ(·, u) of (7.100).
Remark 7.12 Thefrequency-domaincondition(7.99)coincideswiththefrequency-
domain condition of the circle criterion for Lagrange stability of system (7.100) in
the phase space Rn [20, 23].
In contrast to the Theorem 7.7, in the circle criterion it is supposed that the
nonlinearityφ has zeros. Thus incasethat thenonlinearity φ has zeros bypreservation

of the rest of the assumptions on φ and the transfer function W the circular globally
asymptotically stable cycle disappears and system (7.100) becomes stable in the
sense of Lagrange in the phase space Rn.
Example 7.5 ([21]) Consider system (7.100) with the nonlinearity φ(w) =
sin w −γ and the transfer function
W(z) =
1
z(z + β) j ,
(7.102)
where β is a positive number and j is a natural number. For j = 1 we have the
pendulum equation with constant torque γ ≥0 and a viscous resistance β ≥0
¨w + β ˙w + sin w = γ.
If j is an arbitrary natural number the transfer function (7.102) generates a system
(7.100) in the j + 1-dimensional cylindrical phase space. It is easy to see that if we
choose −κ1 = κ2 = 1 the inequality (7.101) is satisﬁed and condition (7.99) becomes
|W(iω −κ)|2 ≤1 for all ω ∈R.
(7.103)
Obviously, for (7.103) it sufﬁces to require that
κ2(β −κ)2 j ≥1.
(7.104)
Since for system (7.100) with W(·) from (7.102) we have det(zI −A) = (z + β) j,
the assumptions of Proposition 7.19 on A + κ I are satisﬁed, if κ < β. Deﬁne κ =
β
j+1 and write condition (7.104) as
a j

(7.105)
Thus on account of Proposition 7.19, if condition (7.105) is satisﬁed, then for
|γ | > 1 the system (7.100) with the nonlinearity sin w −γ and the transfer function
(7.102) has an globally asymptotically orbitally stable cycle of the second kind. If
|γ | ≤1 this cycle disappears and in the covering space R j+1 all positive semi-orbits
of (7.100) are bounded.

Dynamical Systems with a Local Contraction Property
In this subsection we describe general properties of dynamical systems on manifolds
which have a certain contraction property transversal to a considered orbit. It will be

shown that this local property characterizes the global behaviour of the system. All
results in this subsection go back to Stenström [33].
Suppose that (M, g) is an n-dimensional Ck-manifold with Riemannian metric.
Let U be an open connected subset of M such that its closure U in M is compact
and its boundary ∂U is an (n −1)-dimensional C1-submanifold of M. Let F be a
C1-vector ﬁeld on some open set U1 ⊃U, i.e.
˙u = F(u)
(7.106)
with F : U1 →T U1. Assume the following conditions:
(A1) F penetrates ∂U inwards, that is, (F(p), n(p)) > 0 for every p ∈∂U, where
n(p) ∈TpM is the inner normal to ∂U at p and (·, ·) stands for the scalar
product in the tangent space induced by the Riemannian metric; | · | is the
corresponding norm.
(A2) For each p ∈U we have (∇υ F(p), υ) < 0 for every vector υ ∈TpM with
(F(p), υ) = 0. Here ∇F(p) : TpM →TpM is the covariant derivative of
F at p ∈M. Note that in local coordinates (A2) has the following form:
(A3) At each point p ∈U we have
	
∂f i
∂x j + Γ i
jk f k
ξ jξ mgim < 0 for every
υ = ξ i∂i(p) ∈TpM with f iξ jgi j = 0 .
Here υ = ξ i∂i(p),
F = f i∂i(p) and gi j are the representations of υ, F and g,
respectively, in an arbitrary chart x around p.
Consider a solution ϕ(·)(p) of (7.106) starting at p ∈U at t = 0. The maps
p →ϕt(p) form a semi-group on U.
Deﬁnition 7.9 For a given ε > 0 the (closed) ε-neighborhood Nε(p) around a semi-
orbit γ+(p) of (7.106) is deﬁned as
Nε(p) := {q ∈U|ρ(q, γ+(p)) ≤ε} .
(Here ρ(·, ·) denotes the metric on M generated by g.) If F(p) ̸= 0 we call Nε(p)
an ε-tube; if F(p) = 0 the set Nε(p) is called a (closed) ε-ball.
The ε-neighborhood Nε(p) is called normal if the ε-neighborhood V of every
point of γ+(p) has the property that any two points in V can be joined by a unique
geodesic in V. The section at u ∈γ+(p) of a normal ε-tube Nε(p) consists of those
q in Nε(p) that can be reached from u along a geodesic in Nε(p) of length ≤ε
perpendicular to F(u). Normal ε-neighborhoods always exist when U is compact.
In case γ+(p) does not contain an equilibrium point, we require Nε(p) to satisfy
also the following condition:
(A3) (F(u), τ u
q F(q)) > 0 for all u, q ∈U with u ∈γ+(p) and ρ(U, q) ≤ε .
(Here τ u
q denotes the parallel transport in M; see Sect. A.8, Appendix A.)

Notethat(A3)canberequiredsincetheinequality(F(u), τ u
q F(q)) > 0 issatisﬁed
on the diagonal of the compact set γ+(p) × γ+(p) of U × U, and therefore is satisﬁed
in some neighborhood of the diagonal.
The next theorem is due to [33].
Theorem 7.8 (a) Let Nε(p) be a normal ε-ball around the equilibrium point p. Then
a solution of (7.106) starting in Nε(p) approaches p with monotonously decreasing
distance from p.
(b) Let Nε(p) be a normal ε-tube around γ+(p), p not an equilibrium of (7.106),
and suppose u ∈Nε(p). Then it holds:
(1) If ϕ(·)(p) tends to an equilibrium q of (7.106), then also ϕ(·)(u) tends to q ;
(2) If ϕ(·)(p) does not tend to any equilibrium point of (7.106), then ϕ(·)(u)
approaches γ+(p) with monotonously decreasing distance.
Proof Let u ∈γ+(p) and consider any geodesic Γ starting at u. For each point
q ∈Γ , let υq be the tangent vector of unit length to Γ at q, showing in the direction
away from u. We will show that if (F(u), υu) = 0 then (F(q), υq) < 0 for all q ∈
Γ, q ̸= u. Assume the opposite, i.e. suppose that (F(q1), υq1) ≥0 for someq1 ∈Γ .
The function q →(F(q), υq) is a C1-function on Γ and
∇υ(F(q), υq) = (∇υ F(q), υq) + (F(q), ∇υυq) .
But ∇υυq = 0, so by condition (A2) we have (F(q), υq) < 0 in a neighborhood of
u ̸= q on Γ . By continuity there exists a nearest q2 to u on Γ where (F(q2), υq2) = 0
and then (F(q), υq) ≤0 between u and q2 on Γ . By the same argument for q2 instead
of u, we ﬁnd that (F(q), −υq) < 0 in a neighborhood of q2 ̸= q on Γ , which gives
a contradiction.
Now let s(t) be the distance of ϕt(q), q ∈Nε, from u ∈γ+(p). When ϕt(q) is in
the ε-sphere around p, we ﬁnd, using normal local coordinates xi around u, that
ds
dt = ∂s
∂xi
dxi
dt = gi j ξ j f i = (F, υ) .
It follows that no solution can leave the ε-tube (resp. the ε-sphere) Nε(p).
□
Using Theorem 7.8 we can show the following two results from [33].
Theorem 7.9 If Eq. (7.106) has an equilibrium point, then this point is the limit set
of (7.106).
Proof The proof follows from the fact that the limit set is connected and from
Theorem 7.8.
□
Theorem 7.10 If Eq. (7.106) has no equilibrium point, then it has a periodic orbit
which is the limit set of (7.106).

7.2 Orbital Stability for Flows on Manifolds
361
Proof Let p be an arbitrary point in the limit set of (7.106). Choose a normal ε-tube
Nε around γ+(p) and let Bε(p) be the ε-ball around p. If ε is small enough, every
solution of (7.106) starting in Bε(p) stays in Nε and we can ﬁnd ε1 < ε such that after
some time all the solutions are in the ε1-tube around γ+(p). Since p is in the limit set,
there is a point u with ρ(u, p) < 1
3(ε −ε1) such that ϕ(·)(u) returns to the 1
3(ε −ε1)-
neighborhood of p for arbitrary large t. Since ϕt(u) is for t ≥0 in the 1
3(ε −ε1)-
tube around γ+(p), this means that ϕT (p) is in the 2
3(ε −ε1)- neighborhood of p for
some arbitrary large T . Then the section at ϕT (p) of the ε1- tube around γ+(p) is
contained in Bε(p). Every solution of (7.106) starting at t = 0 in Bε(p) reaches this
section at a time nearly to T , which gives a continuous map of Bε(p) into the section,
i.e. into Bε(p). By the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem (Theorem B.3, Appendix B) this
map has a ﬁxed point. Thus every neighborhood of p contains an initial point for
a periodic solution of (7.106). It follows then from Theorem 7.8 that ϕ(·)(p) is the
unique periodic solution of (7.106).
□
Recall for the next theorem from [33] that the solid n-torus (see Sect. A.10,
Appendix A) is the set Rn−1 × S1, while the solid Klein bottle is the non-trivial ﬁber
bundle of Rn−1 over S1.
Theorem 7.11 (a) System (7.106) has an equilibrium point if and only if U is home-
omorphic with Rn;
(b) System (7.106) has a periodic solution if and only if U is homeomorphic with
either a solid torus or a solid Klein bottle.
Proof It follows immediately from Theorem 7.10 and the Euler Poincaré formula
for the Euler characteristic (see Sect. B.4, Appendix B).
□
In the Euclidean case the obtained theorems lead to the following result. Suppose
that
˙x = f (x)
(7.107)
is a C1-vector ﬁeld f : G →Rn on an open subset G of Rn. Let us assume that U is
an open, connected and bounded subset of G with U ⊂G and such that f penetrates
∂U inwards. The scalar product and the norm in Rn are denoted by (·, ·) and | · |,
respectively. Then the following theorem [33] is true.
Theorem 7.12 Suppose that there exists a constant, positive deﬁnite, symmetric
n × n matrix P such that for each x ∈U,
(Df (x)y, Py) < 0 for all y ̸= 0, ( f (x), Py) = 0.
Then it holds:
(a) U is homeomorphic with either Rn or a solid torus ;
(b) If U is homeomorphic with Rn then system (7.107) has an equilibrium point
as limit set ω(U). If U is homeomorphic with a solid torus then system (7.107) has
a limit cycle as limit set ω(U).

362

Basic Concepts for Dimension Estimation on Manifolds
Proof Apply the previous Theorem 7.11 with the ﬂat metric on Rn deﬁned by the
matrix P.
□
Remark 7.13 Suppose that f (y) ̸= 0, ∀y ∈U, for the vector ﬁeld (7.107), where
U ⊂Rn is again a bounded, connected and open set in G. Suppose that ϕ : R+ →
U is a solution of (7.107) with dist (ϕ(t), ∂U) > ζ > 0, ∀t ≥0. Deﬁne ϑ(y) :=
max(Df (y)x, x) for all x, |x| = 1, such that (x, f (y)) = 0, and suppose that ϑ(y) ≤
−c < 0, ∀y ∈U.
Then the ω-limit set of ϕ is a periodic solution ϕ0 of (7.106) which has n −1
characteristic exponents with negative real part and, consequently, is asymptotically
orbitally stable.

Chapter 8
Dimension Estimates on Manifolds
Abstract In this chapter generalizations of the Douady-Oesterlé theorem (Theorem
5.1, Chap. 5) are obtained for maps and vector ﬁelds on Riemannian manifolds.
The proof of the generalized Douady-Oesterlé theorem on manifolds is given in
Sect.8.1. In Sect.8.2 it is shown that the Lyapunov dimension is an upper bound for
the Hausdorff dimension. A tubular Carathéodory structure is used in Sect.8.3 for
the estimation of the Hausdorff dimension of invariant sets.

Introduction
In this section a version of the Douady-Oesterlé theorem [5] is obtained by requiring
weaker conditions for the map under consideration. Lyapunov functions are intro-
duced to modify the Jacobian matrix of the tangent map. That includes naturally a
change of the singular values of the Jacobian matrix.
In this section, we also show that these results follow directly from a generalization
of the Douady-Oesterlé theorem to Riemannian manifolds. With slightly stronger
assumptions, such kind of generalization is quoted in [15].
In the last part of this section, the number of closed orbits for autonomous dif-
ferential equations will be estimated from above in the form of a Bendixson-Dulac-
criterion for Riemannian manifolds.

8.1.2
Hausdorff Dimension Bounds for Invariant Sets
of Maps on Manifolds
Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold without boundary, of dimension n and class
C1. Let U ⊂M be an open subset and let us consider a map ϕ : U →M of class
C1. The tangent map of ϕ at a point u ∈M is denoted by duϕ : TuM →Tϕ(u)M.
Remark 8.1 Let u ∈U be an arbitrary point and consider charts x and x′ at u and
ϕ(u), respectively. We introduce the matrices G := (gi j(u)) and G′ = (g′
i j(u)) that
realize the metric fundamental tensor g in the canonical bases of TuM and Tϕ(u)M,
respectively. The tangent map of ϕ at u written in coordinates of the charts x and x′
is given by the matrix  := D(x′ ◦ϕ ◦x−1)(x(u)). From Example 7.1, Chap. 7, it
follows that the singular values of the tangent map duϕ : TuM →Tϕ(u)M coincide
with the singular values of the matrix

G−1.
The following theorem from [24] generalizes the results of Sect. 5.1, Chap. 5 to
Riemannian manifolds.
Theorem 8.1 Let d ∈(0, n) be a real number and K ⊂U be a compact set which
is negatively invariant with respect to ϕ, i.e. ϕ(K) ⊃K. If the inequality
sup
u∈K
ωd(duϕ) < 1
(8.1)
holds, then dimH K < d .
The proof of Theorem 8.1 is postponed to the end of this subsection. Now we
proceed with some corollaries. The ﬁrst one concerns a result which has been formu-
lated in Sect. 5.1, Chap. 5 for the case M = Rn using slightly stronger conditions
for the map.
Corollary 8.1 Let K ⊂U ⊂M be a compact set satisfying ϕ(K) ⊃K. If for some
continuous function κ : U →R+ and for some number d ∈(0, n] the inequality
sup
u∈K
κ(ϕ(u))
κ(u) ωd(duϕ)

< 1
(8.2)
holds, then dimH K < d.
Proof On the open set U ⊂M we introduce a new metric tensor g by g|u :=
κ2(u)g|u. It is easy to show that this is really a Riemannian metric equivalent to
the given one on compact subsets of M. Since K is compact, the new equivalent
metric does not alter the value of the Hausdorff dimension of K.
Let us consider an arbitrary point u ∈K and two charts x and x′ around u and ϕ(u),
respectively. Suppose that G := (gi j(u)) and G′ := (g′
i j(ϕ(u))) are the realizations
with respect to the canonical bases in TuM and Tϕ(u)M of the metric tensors g and

g′, respectively. As indicated in Remark 8.1 the singular values of the tangent map
duϕ in the new metric are the singular values of the matrix

Thus, condition (8.2) guarantees, that in the new metric the inequality (8.1) is valid
and Theorem 8.1 can be applied.
□
The next corollary [24] provides a method for estimating the Hausdorff dimension
without explicit computation of the singular values.
Corollary 8.2 Let K ⊂U ⊂M be a compact set which is assumed to be negatively
invariant with respect to ϕ. Let θ : U →R+ be a continuous function and let d ∈
(0, n] be a real number such that the conditions
(a)

[(duϕ)[∗]duϕ]υ, υ

≥θ(u)2|υ|2 ,
∀u ∈K,
∀υ ∈TuM,
and
(b)
| det duϕ|
θ(u)n−d < 1 ,
∀u ∈K ,
are satisﬁed. Then dimH K < d.
Proof From condition a) for the singular values αi(u) of the tangent map duϕ we
obtain the inequalities
αi(u) ≥θ(u) ,
∀u ∈K,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Thus, for any k ∈{0, 1, . . . , n} and u ∈K with α0(u) := 1 it follows that
α1(u) · · · αk(u)θ(u)n−k ≤α1(u) · · · αn(u) = | det duϕ|.
For d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] the last relation together
with condition b) of the corollary leads to
α1(u)· · ·αd0(u)αs
d0+1(u) =

α1(u)· · ·αd0(u)
1−s
α1(u) · · · αd0(u)αd0+1(u)

≤| det duϕ|1−s
θ(u)(n−d0)(1−s)
| det duϕ|s
θ(u)(n−d0−1)s = | det duϕ|
θ(u)n−d < 1.
Now, the only thing left to do is to apply Theorem 8.1.
□
Let us come back now to the Riemannian manifold (M, g) and consider the
exponential map (see Sect. A.8, Appendix A) expu : TuM →M at an arbitrary
point u ∈M. Then the set expu(E) is the image of an ellipsoid E in the tangent
space TuM centered at 0 under the map expu.
Let K ⊂U be a compact set, let ε > 0 be a sufﬁciently small number and let us
ﬁx a number d ∈(0, n]. The ellipsoid premeasure at level ε and of order d of K is
given by

ωd(Ei)
where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite covers 	
i expui(Ei) ⊃K, where ui ∈M,
and Ei ⊂TuiM are ellipsoids satisfying ωd(Ei)1/d ≤ε. Now we show the equiva-
lence of both the Hausdorff premeasure and the ellipsoid premeasure in a similar
way as is done in Sect. 5.1, Chap. 5.
Lemma 8.1 For an arbitrary number d ∈(0, n] written in the form d = d0 + s with
d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] we deﬁne the numbers Cd := 2d0(d0 + 1)d/2
and λd := √d0 + 1. Then for a compact set K ⊂U and for every sufﬁciently small
ε > 0 the inequalities
μH(K, d, ε) ≥μH(K, d, ε) ≥C−1
d μH(K, d, λd ε)
(8.3)
hold.
Proof In a number of technical details the proof differs from the one given in Sect.
5.1, Chap. 5.
In analogous manner as in Sect. 5.1, Chap. 5, it is established that for sufﬁ-
ciently small ε > 0, for an arbitrary u ∈K and any ellipsoid E ⊂TuM satisfying
ωd(E)1/d ≤ε the relation
μH(expu(E), d, λd ε) ≤Cd ωd(E)
(8.4)
is valid.
Let us now ﬁx a ﬁnite cover of K consisting of sets {expui(Ei)}, where ωd(Ei)1/d ≤
ε holds for all indices i. The properties of the premeasures then guarantee the fol-
lowing relation
μH(K, d, λd ε) ≤μH

μH(expui(Ei), d, λd ε).
Using (8.4) we obtain μH(K, d, λd ε) ≤Cd

i ωd(Ei) and since the cover was arbi-
trary among all those satisfying the restriction for ωd we have
μH(K, d, λd ε) ≤Cd μH(K, d, ε).
□
Lemma 8.2 Let K ⊂U be a compact set and consider a map ϕ : U →M of class
C1. For a number d ∈(0, n] we assume that supu∈K ωd(duϕ) ≤k. Then, for every
l > k there exists a number ε0 > 0 such that for every ε ∈(0, ε0]
μH(ϕ(K), d, λd l

holds, where Cd and λd are deﬁned as in Lemma 8.1.

the points of M and by τ υ
u we denote the isometry between TuM and TυM deﬁned
by parallel transport along the geodesic for points lying sufﬁciently near to each other
(see Sect. A.8, Appendix A).
Let us ﬁx a ﬁnite cover with balls {B(ui,ri)}i of radius ri ≤ε of K. Then every
ball B(ui,ri) satisfying B(ui,ri) ∩K ̸= ∅is entirely contained in the open set V.
The Taylor formula for differentiable maps provides that for every υ ∈B(ui,ri)

Further by using (8.7), (8.10) and (8.11) and by Lemma 7.1, Chap. 7 there can be

We can summarize that every ﬁnite cover of the compact set K with balls
{B(ui,ri)}i of radius ri ≤ε such that B(ui,ri) ∩K is non-empty, generates a cover
{expui(E′

□
Proof of Theorem 8.1 The essence of the proof of Theorem 8.1 is contributed by
Lemma 8.2. The lemma claims that the Hausdorff premeasure deﬁned on a Rieman-
nian manifold exhibits the same properties concerning the effect of a map ϕ of class
C1 as it has in Rn. When applying Lemma 8.2 the statement of Theorem 8.1 follows
directly from arguments that agree with the last steps of the proof of Theorem 5.1 in
Sect.5.1, Chap. 5.
□
The next theorem provides another important result, the proof of which follows
directly from Lemma 8.2 using the same arguments as in [19].
Theorem 8.2 Let the manifold M be compact and let ϕ : M →M be a map of
class C1. Suppose that supu∈M ωd(duϕ) < 1 holds for a number d ∈(0, n]. If for a
compact set K ⊂M the condition μH(K, d) < ∞is satisﬁed, then
lim
m→∞μH(ϕm(K), d) = 0.
Remark 8.2 A version of Theorem 8.1 for differential equations in Hilbert spaces
is given in [3]. For vector ﬁelds on Hilbert manifolds a similar theorem is shown in
[13, 14].

8.1.3
Time-Dependent Vector Fields on Manifolds
Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension n and of
class C2, let U ⊂M be an open subset and I1 ⊂R an open interval with 0 ∈I1.
We consider a time-dependent vector ﬁeld F : I1 × U →T U of class C1 and the
corresponding differential equation
˙u = F(t, u) .
(8.12)
Suppose, that for a point (t, u) ∈I1 × U the covariant derivative of the vector ﬁeld
F is ∇F(t, u) : TuM →TuM. We assume for (8.12) that there can be found an
open set D ⊂U and an open interval I ⊂I1 such that the solution ϕ(·, u) of (8.12)
starting at u ∈D for t = 0 exists everywhere on I. For every t ∈I we can deﬁne
the t-shift operator ϕt : D →U by ϕt(u) := ϕ(t, u). In case the differential equation
(8.12) is autonomous, the family {ϕt}t∈I of all those t-shifts is a local ﬂow.
Since the vector ﬁeld F is continuously differentiable, the same holds for the
time-t-shift operators ϕt (t ∈I). For an arbitrary point u ∈D, the tangent map duϕt
solves the variation equation
y′ = ∇F(t, ϕt(u))y
(8.13)
with initial condition duϕt
|t=0 = idTuM. Here the absolute derivative y′ is taken along
the integral curve t →ϕt(u) in the direction of the vector ﬁeld F. Let us denote the
eigenvalues of the symmetric part of the covariant derivative ∇F(t, u), i.e., of the
operator
S(t, u) := 1

by λi(t, u) (i = 1, . . . , n) and order them with respect to its size and multiplicity, i.e.,
λ1(t, u) ≥· · · ≥λn(t, u). The divergence divF(t, u) of the vector ﬁeld F at (t, u) ∈
I1 × U is the trace of the linear operator ∇F(t, u) : TuM →TuM and therefore
divF(t, u) = tr∇F(t, u) = λ1(t, u) + · · · + λn(t, u) holds. The next theorem is the
main result of this section and extends a result of [27] to Riemannian manifolds. The
proof is given at the end of the section.
Theorem 8.3 Let d ∈(0, n] be a real number written in the form d = d0 + s with
d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] and let K ⊂D be a compact set satisfying

Remark 8.3 We shall now consider an arbitrary u ∈U and a chart x around u.
In local coordinates of x and in the canonical basis ∂1(u), . . . , ∂n(u) of the tan-
gent space TuM, the vector ﬁeld of (8.12) then becomes F(t, u) = f i(t, u)∂i(u)
and the covariant derivative ∇F(t, u) : TuM →TuM : υ →∇υ F(t, u) is given by
∇υ F(t, u) = ∇i f k(t, u)υi∂k(u), where υ = υi∂i(u) is an arbitrary vector in TuM
and
∇i f k = ∂f k
∂xi + Γ k

Here by Γ k
i j the Christoffel symbols in the chart x corresponding to the metric tensor
g are denoted (see Sect. A.5, Appendix A). The symmetric part S(t, u) of ∇F(t, u)
in the canonical basis of TuM is realized by the matrix

Let us deﬁne fs,i = gst∇i f t and consider the quadratic form esi = 1

Then esi is related to (8.15) in the sense that the eigenvalues of this quadratic form,

Let us now, by means of the notion c jk = gikΓ i

Before we devote ourselves to the proof of Theorem 8.3, we shall add some
corollaries. The ﬁrst one generalizes results from Chap. 5 formulated there for the
case M = Rn and under slightly stronger conditions. Keeping in mind the second
method of Lyapunov which is often used in stability theory, that result is in Sect. 5.1,
Chap. 5 referred to as “introduction of a Lyapunov function in Hausdorff dimension
estimates”.
From the point of view of the present section this approach can be treated as the
introduction of a new metric tensor on the manifold. Note that a special case of this
theorem for vector ﬁelds on a cylinder is considered in [17].
For a differentiable function V : U →R the map ˙V : I1 × U →R deﬁned by
˙V (t, u) = (duV, F(t, u)) is the derivative of V in the direction of the vector ﬁeld F.

Corollary 8.3 Let K ⊂D be a compact set such that ϕτ(K) ⊃K is true for some
τ ∈I ∩R+. Let V : U →R be a differentiable function and denote by λ1(t, u) ≥

Proof We shall introduce on U a new metric tensor g|u = κ2(u)g|u by means of
some function κ : U →R+ of class C1. Let us ﬁx a point u ∈U and consider a
chart x around u. Further, let the metric tensor g and the vector ﬁeld F be expressed
in the canonical basis of TuM by gi j and f i, respectively. The symmetric part of
the covariant derivative ∇F(t, u) at u ∈U with respect to the new metric is then
determined according to Remark 8.3 by the matrix representation

Suppose that Λ is a logarithmic norm on the space of linear operators Lu :
TuM →TuM. For a number d = d0 + s with integer d0 ∈[0, n −1] and s ∈[0, 1]
we introduce the partial d-trace w.r.t. Λ of ∇F(t, u) : TuM →TuM
trd,Λ ∇F(t, u) = sΛ(∇F(t, u)[d0+1] + (1 −s)Λ(∇F(t, u)[d0].
Then the following Corollary 8.4 is true.
Corollary 8.4 Let K ⊂D be a compact set such that ϕτ(K) ⊃K is true for some

holds, then dimH K < d.
To verify the conditions of Theorem 8.3 we need to compute the eigenvalues of the
symmetric part of the covariant derivative. The next two corollaries are variations of
this theorem using conditions on the divergence of the vector ﬁeld of (8.12). Similar
results for the case M = Rn can be found in Sect. 5.2, Chap. 5.
Corollary 8.5 Let K ⊂D be a compact set such that ϕτ(K) ⊃K holds for some
τ ∈I ∩R+. Assume that for a continuous function θ : I × U →R and for some
d ∈(0, n] the conditions

λi(t, u) ≥−θ(t, u)
∀(t, u) ∈[0, τ] × U, i = 1, . . . , n .
(8.19)
Thus, if k ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}, t ∈[0, τ] and u ∈U are arbitrary then
λ1(t, u) + · · · + λk(t, u) −(n −k)θ(t, u) ≤trS(t, u) = divF(t, u).
This implies
λ1(t, u) + · · · + λd0(t, u) + sλd0+1(t, u) ≤divF(t, u) + (n −d)θ(t, u).
By using condition (b) and Theorem 8.3 the proof is complete.
□
Corollary 8.6 Consider (8.12) on an open set U ⊂Rn. Suppose that system (8.12)
possesses a compact set K satisfying ϕτ(K) ⊃K for some τ ∈I ∩R+. Further,
assume that there exist a number d ∈(0, n], an n × n matrix H = H T > 0 and a
continuous function θ : I × U →R such that the condition b) of Corollary 8.5 and
the inequality

∀(t, u) ∈[0, τ] × U

are satisﬁed. Then dimH K < d.
Proof Let us introduce in U a new metric by means of the matrix (gi j) ≡H. From
Remark 8.3 it follows that the eigenvalues λi(t, u) of S(t, u) with respect to the new
metric, agree with the eigenvalues of the quadratic form corresponding to (8.15).
Therefore, they satisfy the relation

out as in the proof of Corollary 8.5.

Proof of Theorem 8.2
Let us ﬁx an arbitrary u ∈K, a number k ∈{1, . . . , n} and
arbitrary υ1, . . . , υk ∈TuM. For every t ∈[0, τ] we introduce
w(t) := |duϕtυ1 ∧· · · ∧duϕtυk|2
∧kTϕt (u)M .
Applying the variational equation (8.13) and Deﬁnition 7.7, Chap. 7, we achieve for
every t in [0, τ] the equation

Remark 8.4 The inequality (8.21) can be interpreted as a generalization of Liou-

(Sect. 2.4, Chap. 2). In particular, from (8.21), by setting k = n and indicating that
λ1(t, ϕt(u)) + · · · + λn(t, ϕt(u)) = tr∇F(t, ϕt(u)) = divF(t, ϕt(u))
(8.24)
we obtain Liouville’s trace formula in the form

For a point u and a chart x in the neighborhood of this point let again gi j, f i and

class C1 and the corresponding differential equation
˙u = F(u) .
(8.26)

8.1 Hausdorff Dimension Estimates for Invariant Sets of Vector Fields
377
We assume that the global ﬂow ϕ : R × M →M of (8.26) exists. As in the previous
subsection we denote by λ1(u) ≥· · · ≥λn(u) the eigenvalues of the symmetric part
S(u) = 1
2

∇F(u)[∗] + ∇F(u)

of the covariant derivative ∇F(u) : TuM →TuM
of F at a point u ∈M.
The main result of this subsection is Theorem 8.4 from [23] which can be con-
sidered as a general formulation of the Bendixson-Dulac-criterion for Riemannian
manifolds of dimension n. Certain generalizations of the original Bendixson-Dulac-
criterion for differential equations in Rn (see Chap. 5) can be derived from that
theorem when adapting it to the particular situation.
In the following, the dimension of the 1-homology group H1(M) of M is denoted
by b1, i.e., the ﬁrst Betti-number of M (see Sect. B.4, Appendix B).
Theorem 8.4 Let the manifold M with Betti-number b1 be compact and suppose
that for the eigenvalues of the symmetric part S of ∇F one of the inequalities
(a)
λ1(u) + λ2(u) < 0
or
(b)
λn−1(u) + λn(u) > 0
is valid on M. Then the system (8.26) possesses on M at most b1 non-trivial periodic
orbits.
Proof Weshallonlyconsiderthecaseofcondition(a),theotheronecanbeperformed
in a similar fashion by considering the negative time evolution of the ﬂow of (8.26).
We ﬁrst take b1 = 0 and show that every closed orbit is constant. Suppose that (8.26)
has a non-trivial closed orbit γ . Let S be a generalized surface in M of minimal
two-dimensional Hausdorff measure 0 < μH(S, 2) < ∞with boundary γ . Notice,
that such a surface as solution of the Plateau problem for Riemannian manifolds
[8, 22] in our situation exists. The properties of the ﬂow ensure that for arbitrary
t ≥0 the set ϕt(S) is again a generalized surface in M with boundary γ . Due to
Theorem 8.2 and condition (a), for sufﬁciently large t > 0 we have
μH(ϕt(S), 2) < μH(S, 2).
But this is in contradiction to the fact that the surface S was taken to be of minimal
two-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
Now, consider the case b1 ≥1. Suppose that (8.26) possesses more than b1 closed
non-trivial orbits in M. Then there are at least two orbits γ1 and γ2 among them
which are homologous to each other. Let S be a surface of minimal two-dimensional
Hausdorff measure with boundary γ1 ∪γ2. Then again, for arbitrary t > 0 the set
ϕt(S) is a surface in M with γ1 ∪γ2 as boundary. For sufﬁciently large t > 0 the
same argument as above together with Theorem 8.2 leads to a contradiction.
□
Let us now add a version of Theorem 8.4 for the case n = 2 that in principle agrees
with the classical negative Bendixson-Dulac-criterion. The difference to Theorem
(8.4) is actually that here a modiﬁcation of the vector ﬁeld is allowed in the way that
products ς F are considered with a C1-smooth function ς : M →R. In the proof
[23] it is conﬁrmed that the introduction of the function ς can be interpreted, similar

378

Dimension Estimates on Manifolds
to the methods of the previous sections, as a transition to an equivalent Riemannian
metric on M.
Corollary 8.7 Let the manifold M with Betti-number b1 be two-dimensional and
compact. Assume that a function ς : M →R of class C1 exists such that the diver-
gence div(ς F) does not vanish on M. Then the system (8.26) possesses on M at
most b1 non-trivial periodic orbits.
Proof We pass on M to the new Riemannian metric g|u := κ(u)g|u for u ∈M.
Consider the two eigenvalues λ1(u) ≥λ2(u) of the symmetric part of the covariant
derivative of F at u ∈M in the new metric g. Then we have 
divF(u) = λ1(u) +
λ2(u) for the divergence of F with respect to g. On the other hand, a straightforward
calculation using representation (8.17) gives

divF = divF + ˙κ
κ = 1
κ div(κF).
When combining relation (8.24) with the previous result, it becomes clear that one
of the conditions (a) or (b) of Theorem 8.4 are satisﬁed if the inequality divF > 0
or divF < 0 holds on M, respectively.
□
Corollary 8.8 Let the manifold M with Betti-number b1 be compact and suppose
that there exists a continuous function θ : M →R such that for the symmetric part
S of ∇F one of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
(a)

S(u)υ, υ

TuM ≥−θ(u)(υ, υ)TuM and divF(u) + (n −2)θ(u) < 0
(u ∈M, υ ∈TuM) or
(b)

S(u)υ, υ

TuM ≤θ(u)(υ, υ)TuM
and divF(u) −(n −2)θ(u) > 0
u ∈M, υ ∈TuM).
Then the system (8.26) possesses on M at most b1 non-trivial periodic orbits.
Proof Again we only prove the case of condition (a). For the second case the same
method can be applied. Analogously to Corollary (8.7) we obtain
λ1(u) + λ2(u) ≤(n −2)θ + divF < 0
and this coincides with the condition (a) of Theorem 8.4.
□
We want to add a further corollary for the special case that the manifold has
the Betti-number b1 = 0. It demonstrates what kind of convergence a system (8.26)
satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 8.4 in this situation necessarily exhibits.
Corollary 8.9 Let the manifold M be compact and b1 = 0. Let the set of equilibria
of system (8.26) consists of isolated points only. If one of the conditions (a) or (b)
of Theorem 8.4 holds, then every orbit of (8.26) converges both for t →∞and for
t →−∞to an equilibrium point.

8.1 Hausdorff Dimension Estimates for Invariant Sets of Vector Fields
379
Proof Again we shall restrict ourselves to the case of condition a). Consider an
arbitrary integral curve ϕ(·, q) of (8.26) for t →∞. The manifold is compact and
therefore the ω-limit set ω(q) is not empty. If we assume that there exists an element
p ∈ω(q) such that p is not an equilibrium point for (8.26), then by Pugh’s closing
lemma (Theorem A.4, Appendix A) in every small neighborhood of F in X 1(M) we
can ﬁnd a vector ﬁeld F such that the corresponding differential equation possesses
a non-trivial periodic orbit through p.
The compactness of M implies that F can be chosen such that for the ﬁrst two
eigenvaluesλ1(u) ≥λ2(u) of the symmetric part of the covariant derivative of F the
propertyλ1(u) +λ2(u) < 0 is maintained on M. But this contradicts the statement
of Theorem 8.4. Thus, we can conclude that p has to be an equilibrium point of the
original system (8.26). Remember that the set of all equilibria of (8.26) was assumed
to consist of isolated points only. This ﬁnally gives ω(q) = {p}, or in other words,
the considered integral curve converges for t →∞to p.
It is clear, that the convergence for t →−∞follows in analogous manner when
investigating the α-limit set instead.

The Lyapunov Dimension as Upper Bound
of the Fractal Dimension
8.2.1
Statement of the Results
In this section we shall show that the maximum local Lyapunov dimension of a
set is an upper bound of the fractal dimension. Our representation follows the
paper of Gelfert [10]. Suppose that (M, g) is an n-dimensional Riemannian C3-
manifold M. Let U ⊂M be an open set and let ϕ : U →M be a C1-map.
Given u ∈U, we consider the singular values α1(duϕ) ≥· · · ≥αn(duϕ) ≥0 of the
tangent map duϕ : TuM →Tϕ(u)M. We denote by dimL(ϕ, u) the local Lyapunov
dimension of ϕ at u ∈U which is deﬁned to be the largest number d ∈(0, n] for
which ωd(duϕ) ≥1. If α1(duϕ) < 1, we set dimL(ϕ, u) = 0. Note that the functions
u →αi(duϕ), i = 1, . . . , n, are continuous on U. The function u →dimL(ϕ, u) is
continuous on U except at a point u which satisﬁes α1(duϕ) = 1, where it is still
upper semi-continuous. For a compact set K ⊂M we introduce the notation
dimL(ϕ, 
K) := sup
u∈
K
dimL(ϕ, u)
and call this value as in the Rn case Lyapunov dimension of ϕ on 
K.
We can now state the theorem ([10]).

Dimension Estimates on Manifolds
Theorem 8.5 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian C3-manifold. Let further U ⊂M be an
open set and let ϕ : U →M be a C1-map. Then for compact sets K,

K ⊂U which satisfy K ⊂ϕt(K) ⊂
K for all t ∈N we have dimF K ≤dimL(ϕ, 
K).
From Theorem 8.5 we deduce the following result [12].
Corollary 8.10 Let U ⊂Rn be an open set, let ϕ : U →Rn be a C1-map, and let
K ⊂U be a compact invariant set of ϕ (that is, ϕ(K) = K). Then
dimF K ≤dimL(ϕ, K) .
Remark 8.5 As in Corollary 8.1 it can be shown that Theorem 5.17, Chap. 5 is a
special case of Theorem 8.5.
Theorem 8.5 will be proved in Sect. 8.2.2.
8.2.2
Proof of Theorem 8.5
Let us start with a dimension estimate from [9]. Recall (Sect. 3.2.2, Chap. 3) that
μB(·, d, ε) denotes the capacitive d-measure at level ε.
Lemma 8.3 Let (M, ρ) be a metric space. If for a compact set K ⊂M and for
numbers d ≥0, η′ > 0 and 0 < D < 1 we have μB(K, d, Dη) ≤μB(K, d, η) for
every η ∈(0, η′], then dimF K ≤d.
Proof Let r ∈(0, η′) be chosen arbitrarily. Because of D < 1 there exists a number
j ∈N for which D jη′ ≤r < D j−1η′. Therefore,
μB(K, d,r) = Nr(K)rd < ND jη′(K) (D j−1η′)d = D−dμB(K, d, D jη′).
(8.27)
Setting η = D j−1η′, . . . , η = η′ we obtain μB(K, d,r) < D−dμB(K, d, η′). Since
K is compact, μB(K, d, η′) is ﬁnite. Thus, μB(K, d,r) is uniformly bounded from
above for all r < η′ which implies dimF K ≤d.
□
Next we shall prove the following lemma in which we set 
K := ∪t≥0ϕt(K).
Lemma 8.4 Let d ∈(0, n) written as d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and
s ∈(0, 1]. Assume that

Then there exist numbers η0 > 0 and a, b ∈(0, 1) and a uniformly continuous func-

K →(a, b) such that for any l ∈N the following holds:

For every ball B(q, η) with η ∈(0, η0) and q ∈ϕl(K) there exists a family of

Denote by expq : TqM →M the exponential map at a point q ∈
K. Since expq is a
smooth map which satisﬁes |dOq expq | = 1, for every point q ∈M there is a number
δq > 0 such that |dυ expq | ≤2 for any υ ∈B(Oq, δq). Further, since 
K is compact,
there is a number δ0 = minq∈
K δq > 0 and, consequently,
ρ (expq υ1, expq υ2) ≤2|υ1 −υ2|TqM
for any q ∈
K and any υ1, υ2 ∈B(Oq, δ0). Here ρ(·, ·) denotes the geodesic distance
on M and τ q
u : TuM →TqM denotes the isometric operator deﬁned by the parallel
transport (see Sect. A.7, Appendix A) along the geodesic for points lying sufﬁciently
close to each other. Let η0 > 0 be so small such that:

(8.33)
Because of the choice of ς in (8.29) and because of Lemma 7.2, Chap. 7, for
every point q ∈ϕl(K) the set dqϕ B(q, η) + B(Oϕ(q), ηη0) can be covered by

balls of radius √d0 + 1(1 + Cη)ς η where ς := max{ς, αd0+1(dqϕ)}. Here the cover
can be evidently chosen in such a way that any ball is contained in a ball of radius
(1 + δ + η)η centered at Oϕ(q), which follows from ω1(dqϕ) < θ and from (8.18)
and (8.28). Hence, by (8.29) and property 2), the set ϕ(B(q, η)) can be covered
by
 2dκ

balls of radius 2√d0 + 1(1 + Cη)ςη. For this cover any ball intersecting

twice the radius.
For u ∈U we put

Thus, for any q ∈ϕl(K) the set ϕ(B(q, η)) ∩ϕl+1(K) can be covered by N(q) balls
B(q j, κ(q)η) , j = 1, . . . , N(q), which are centered at q j ∈ϕl+1(K). Here we have

(8.34)
This proves the lemma.

Proof of Theorem 8.3 Let us assume that dimL(ϕ, 

arbitrary number d ∈(dimL(ϕ, 
K), n). Recall that

for any natural number t. Hence, for sufﬁciently large number t ∈N, we have
2(8√d0 + 1)dωd(ϕt, 
K) < 1 and thus the assumption of Lemma 8.4 is satisﬁed for
the map ψ := ϕt.
Let us choose an arbitrary ﬁnite cover U := ∪J
j=1B(p j, η) of K with p j ∈K. We
construct a family of ﬁlial covers. By Lemma 8.4, for any ball B(p j, η) we ﬁnd a
family of balls
F(1)(B(p j, η)) =

B(qi, κ(p)η)
N(p)
i=1
which cover the set ψ(B(p j, η)) ∩ψ(K). We call F(1)(B(p j, η)) in accordance
with [2] a family of ﬁlial balls for B(p j, η) of order 1. Further, we deﬁne a sequence
families of ﬁlial balls of order t recursively by setting
F(t)(B(p j, η)) =

Let us denote by r(B) the radius of a ball B. For each family of ﬁlial balls of

Because of (8.34), to any point p ∈K we can assign a prehistory of ﬁnite length
I (p) for which the inequalities
ac < κ(s1(p)) · · · κ(sI (p)(p)) ≤c
(8.38)
hold. Because of (8.34) and (8.38) we obtain ac < bI (p) and aI (p) < c, and therefore

for any p ∈K. Without loss of generality we can assume that c has been chosen
small enough such that I (p) > 1 for all p ∈K. We set I := supp∈K I (p) which is
ﬁnite because of (8.39).
We now construct the homogeneous cover G of K. First, for each point p ∈K
we construct a ball of radius approximately cη containing p as follows: We take the
history {s0(p), s1(p), . . . } of p and choose some ball in U which contains the point
sI (p)(p) and denote it by Bp,I (p). Along the orbit
sI (p)(p) →sI (p)−1(p) →· · · →s1(p) →s0(p) = p
of length I (p) we construct balls Bp,I (p)−(i+1) , i = 0, . . . , I (p) −1, which are
deﬁned recursively as follows. The union of ﬁlial balls of the family F(1)(Bp,I (p)−i)
covers the set ψ(Bp,I (p)−i) ∩ψi(K). Choose Bp,I (p)−(i+1) as a ball from this cover
which contains the point sI (p)−(i+1)(p). We obtain
sI (p)(p) ∈Bp,I (p), . . . , s0(p) = p ∈Bp,0.
We denote bysi(p) the center point of the corresponding ball Bp,i , i = 0, . . . , I (p).
By construction in the proof of Lemma 8.4, si(p) ∈ψ I (p)−i(K). Since Bp,0 is an
element of a family of ﬁlial balls for Bp,I (p) of order I (p) we have
r(Bp,0) = κ(sI (p)(p)) · · · κ(s1(p))r(Bp,I (p)).
Since Bp,I (p) ∈U, we have r(Bp,I (p)) = η and therefore
r(Bp,0) = κ(sI (p)(p)) · · · κ(s1(p))η.

Further,

i = 0, . . . , I (p).
(8.41)
Now we choose a sub-family G := {Bpl,0}L
l=1 of the family {Bp,0}p∈K such that the
union ∪L
l=1Bpl,0 covers the compact set K and set
R := max
l=1,...,L r(Bpl,0).
(8.42)
Each ball Bpl,0 in G with radius r(Bpl,0) and center point pl = s0(pl) can be replaced
by the concentric ball with radius R. This gives us a cover
G := {B(s0(pl), R)}L
l=1
of K with balls of equal radius R, where R ∈(acη, cη] because of (8.38).

8.2 The Lyapunov Dimension as Upper Bound …
385
We shall now study the oscillation of the radii of balls within the cover G. For
this, choose some number Δ > 1 satisfying
Δ2dI < 2.
(8.43)
From Lemma 8.4 we obtain the uniform continuity of the function κ on 
K. Further,
by (8.35) this function is on 
K uniformly bounded from below by a positive number.
Thus, there exists η1 > 0 such that
κ(p)
κ(q) ≤Δ ,
∀p, q ∈
K, ρ (p, q) < η1.
(8.44)
W.l.o.g. we can take η1 = η0. From (8.41), (8.44) and (8.38), for every l = 1, . . . , L
we conclude
r(Bpl,0)
η
= κ(s1(pl)) · · · κ(sI (pl)(pl)) ≤ΔI (pl)c.
Analogously we obtain
η
r(Bpl,0) ≤
ΔI (pl)
κ(s1(pl)) · · · κ(sI (pl)(pl)) < ΔI (pl)
ac
.
Thus, for any two balls Bpl,0 and Bpk,0 from the cover G we have
r(Bpl,0)
r(Bpk,0) < ΔI (pk)
ac
ΔI (pl)c ≤Δ2I
a .
Finally, for the radius R, from (8.42)
R ≤Δ2I
a r(Bpl,0)
(8.45)
follows.
We shall now estimate the capacitive d-measure at level R of K, i.e., the outer
measure μB(·, d, R) on M. Since K has been covered by balls from G with equal
radius R, we obtain by (8.45)
μB(K, d, R) ≤

belongs to the family of ﬁlial balls of B(p j, η) of order I (p j). Consequently, each
term in sum in the right-hand term in (8.46) occurs at most once as a term in the sum

μB(K, d, R) < 4 2−log c

(8.48)
We shall now apply Lemma 8.3. The initial cover U of K of balls of radius η
centered at a point in K has been chosen arbitrarily. Any ball intersecting K of
radius η
2 can be replaced by one which is centered in K and with radius η. Thus,
we can replace the right-hand side in (8.43) by μB(K, d, η
2). All assumptions of
Lemma 8.3 are thus satisﬁed. From μB(K, d, R) < μB(K, d, η
2) and R ≤cη < η

the estimate dimF K ≤d follows. This holds for arbitrary d > dimL(ψ, 
K) which
proves Theorem 8.5.

Remark 8.6 For a C1-map in Rn and a compact invariant set Theorem 8.5 has been
shown by Hunt [12], where the author uses the on Rn equivalent deﬁnition of the
fractal dimension via a grid covering. For twice continuously Frechét-differentiable
maps in a separable Hilbert space, Blinchevskaya and Ilyashenko [2] extended this
result by showing that a compact invariant set has fractal dimension not exciting k if
the map contracts k-volumina.

Global Lyapunov Exponents and Upper Lyapunov
Dimension
Let us consider the long-term behaviour of the dynamical system ϕ : N × K →K
generated by the iterates ϕt (t ∈N) on an invariant set K ⊂U. We introduce the
global Lyapunov exponents νu
1 ≥· · · ≥νu
n of ϕ on K which are recursively deﬁned
by
νu
1 + · · · + νu
j := lim
t→+∞
1
t log max
p∈K ω j(dpϕt) ,
j = 1, . . . , n.
The upper Lyapunov dimension of ϕ on K with respect to the global Lyapunov
exponents is
dimu
L(ϕ, K) := k + νu
1 + · · · + νu
k
|νu
k+1|
where k ∈{0, . . . , n −1} denotes the smallest number satisfying νu
1 + · · · + νu
k+1
< 0.
Using Theorem 8.5 and the method of proof of Theorem 3.3 in [28], we obtain
the following result [10].
Theorem 8.6 Let (M, g) be a Riemannian C3-manifold. Let U ⊂M be an open
set, and let ϕ : U →M be a C1-map. For a compact and invariant set K ⊂U we
have dimF K ≤dimu
L(ϕ, K).
Remark 8.7 Since for invariant sets K the function t →maxp∈K ωd(dpϕt) is sub-
exponential (cp. [28]), we have
dimu
L(ϕ, K) ≤inf
t∈N dimL(ϕt, K) = lim
t→+∞dimL(ϕt, K).
(8.49)
Further, recall [15] that
inf
t→+∞dimL(ϕt, K) = sup
μ
dimL(ϕ, μ)
where dimL(ϕ, μ) denotes the Lyapunov dimension with respect to the Lyapunov
exponents νi(μ) of μ and where the supremum is taken over all invariant ergodic
probability measures supported on K.
In correspondence to the global Lyapunov exponents the local Lyapunov expo-
nents ν1(p) ≥· · · ≥νn(p) of ϕ at a point p ∈K (see also Chap. 6) are deﬁned
recursively by
ν1(p) + · · · + ν j(p) = lim sup
t→+∞
1
t log ω j(dpϕt) ,
j = 1, . . . , n.

388

Dimension Estimates on Manifolds
The local upper Lyapunov dimension of ϕ at p with respect to the local Lyapunov
exponents is then given by
dimL(ϕ, p) := k(p) + ν1(p) + · · · + νk(p)(p)
|νk(p)+1(p)|
where k(p) ∈{0, . . . , n −1} denotes the smallest number satisfying
ν1(p) + · · · + νk(p)+1(p) < 0.
Remark 8.8 For an invariant set K the inequality
sup
p∈K
dimL(ϕ, p) ≤dimu
L(ϕ, K)
has been proven by Eden ([6]). He presumed that for a typical system ([6]) there
always exists a point p satisfying dimL(ϕ, p) = dimu
L(ϕ, K). He refers also to exam-
ples for which strict inequality holds.
8.2.4
Application to the Lorenz System
To handle systems on Riemannian manifolds gives us the freedom also to construct
adapted metrics. Recall that, within a class of equivalent metrics, the box dimension
of a compact set is the same. However, notice that the local Lyapunov dimensions
of a differentiable map strongly depends on the Riemannian metric. This fact can
be used to optimize dimension estimates (see, for instance, [4, 19, 23] for a related
approach using adapted Lyapunov functions).
As an example we consider the ﬂow ϕ : R × R3 →R3 of the Lorenz system
˙x = −σ x + σ y
˙y = rx −y −xz
˙z = −bz + xy
(8.50)
with given parameters b = 8
3, σ = 10 and r = 28. The ﬂow is dissipative and has a
global attractor A ⊂R3. Since the divergence of the vector ﬁeld f given by (8.50)
equals div f = −(σ + 1 + b) < 0, the Lorenz system is volume-contracting, hence
the Lorenz attractor has Lebesgue measure zero. It was shown in Sect. 6.5.2, Chap. 6
that the maximal local Lyapunov dimension of the time-1-map ϕ1 on A equals
the local Lyapunov dimension of ϕ1 at the equilibrium point p0 = (0, 0, 0) . There
were used certain linear transformations and Lyapunov-type functions. We put this
approach into the framework of adaption of metrics. For this we introduce the family
of matrices

L(ϕ1, p0). Hence, the dynami-
cal system generated by (8.50) on A is typical in the sense of Remark 8.8. Moreover,

The Lorenz attractor A observed numerically has been the object of several ana-
lytic estimates of the box dimension (e.g., Eden et al. [7] obtained dimF A ≤2.408).
Since the local Lyapunov dimension of an equilibrium point is invariant under
changes of metrics, estimate (8.53) is optimal in terms of methods developed
in this section and in [4, 7, 12, 28]. However, numerical investigations suggest
dimB A ≈2.05.

The System in Normal Variation
An important class of invariant sets of dynamical systems are strange attractors
which locally have the structure of the product of a smooth (often one-dimensional)
submanifold directed “along the attractor” and a Cantor-like set, “transversal” to the
attractor [25]. Thus, it is natural to investigate the stability and dimension properties
of such attractors considering the intersection of the attractors with surfaces which
are locally transversal to the attractor [11, 16]. The use of transverse intersections is
well-known in stability theory.

Consider now a Riemannian manifold (M, g) of dimension n(n ≥2) and, for
simplicity, of class C∞. Let F : M →T M be a vector ﬁeld of class C2 on M and
let us consider the corresponding differential equation
˙u = F(u).
(8.54)
For simplicity, let us assume that the global ﬂow ϕ : R × M →M of (8.54) exists.
This ﬂow ϕ can also be written as a one-parameter family of C2-diffeomorphisms
{ϕt}t∈R with ϕt(·) = ϕ(t, ·).
The behaviour of system (8.54) near a given solution ϕ(·)(p) is described by the
variational equation
Dy
dt = ∇F(ϕt(p))y .
(8.55)
All points p ∈M with F(p) ̸= Op (F(p) = Op), where Op denotes the origin
of the tangent space TpM, we call regular (singular) points of the vector ﬁeld F. If
p is a regular point we may consider the system in normal variations with respect to
the solution ϕ(·)(p) of (8.55)
Dz
dt = A(ϕt(p))z,
(8.56)
where the linear operator A(p) : TpM →TpM is given by
A(p) = ∇F(p) −B(p),
where
B(p)υ = 2 F(p)
|F(p)|2 (F(p), S∇F(p)υ)
for all υ ∈TpM.
(8.57)
The scalar product (·, ·) and the associated norm | · | are taken in the tangent space
TpM. In coordinates of an arbitrary chart x : D(x) →R(x) around the regular point
p, the linear operator A(p) is given by
Ak


g jk∇k f pgpi + ∇i f j
is the representation in
coordinates of the symmetric part S∇F(p) of the covariant derivative of the vector
ﬁeld F in this chart. Note that for ODE’s in Rn with standard metric, the system in
normal variations (8.56) coincides with the system in modiﬁed variations. Suppose
that p ∈M is a regular point of F and y(·) is a solution of (8.56) along ϕ(·)(p). This
solution can be split for any t ∈R into two orthogonal components as
y(t) = z(t) + μ(t)F(ϕt(p)),
(8.59)

392

Dimension Estimates on Manifolds
where z(·) is the solution of (8.56) with respect to ϕ(·)(p) with initial condition z(0) =
y(0) and μ(·) is a scalar valued C1-function given by μ(t) = (y(t), F(ϕt(p)))
/|F(ϕt(p))|2.
For every regular point p ∈M of F we introduce the (n −1)-dimensional linear
subspace
T ⊥(p) =

υ ∈TpM : (υ, F(p)) = 0

of the tangent space TpM. Denote by SA(p) := 1
2[A(p) + A(p)[∗]] the symmetric
part of the operator A(p). A straight forward calculation shows that for all υ ∈T ⊥(p)
the following two relations
(F(p), SA(p)υ) = 0 and
(υ, A(p)υ) = (υ, ∇F(p)υ)
(8.60)
are satisﬁed. Hence, we have SA(p) : T ⊥(p) →T ⊥(p). Using this fact one can
easily prove the ﬁrst part of the following lemma [21].
Lemma 8.5 For an arbitrary regular point p ∈M of the vector ﬁeld (8.55), the
eigenvalues of the operator SA(p) : TpM →TpM are the eigenvalues of the
operator SA(p) which is restricted to the linear subspace T ⊥(p) and the value
−(∇F(p)F(p), F(p))/|F(p)|2. Further we have
S∇F(p)z −
F(p)
|F(p)|2 (F(p), S∇F(p)z) = SA(p)z
for all z ∈T ⊥(p).
In the following, we denote at any regular point p of (8.54) the eigenvalues of the
operator SA(p) restricted to the subspace T ⊥(p) by λ⊥
1 (p) ≥· · · ≥λ⊥
n−1(p), which
are ordered with respect to size and multiplicity. By Z(t, p) we denote the operator
solution of (8.56) with initial condition Z(0, p) = idT ⊥(p). For every t ∈R, the linear
operator Z(t, p) : T ⊥(p) →T ⊥(ϕt(p)) maps between the subspaces T ⊥(p) and
T ⊥(ϕt(p)) being orthogonal to the vector ﬁeld in p and ϕt(p), respectively. The
next lemma can be proved analogously to Theorem 8.3.
Lemma 8.6 Suppose that p ∈M is a regular point of the vector ﬁeld (8.54) and
Z(·, p) is the operator solution of (8.56). Let d ∈(0, n −1] be written in the form
d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −2} and s ∈(0, 1]. Then for all t ≥0 it holds

Ouraimistodescribethevariationoftimetranslatedpiecesof(n −1)-dimensional
submanifolds, orthogonal to a considered orbit of (8.54). For this purpose we use the
methods from Sect. 7.2, Chap. 7, developed there for stability investigations of ﬂows
on manifolds. Considering a non-equilibrium solution ϕ(·)(p) of (8.54) with p ∈M
the local transformation of small pieces of (n −1)-dimensional submanifolds can
be described by a reparametrized local ﬂow. For δ > 0, so small that expp is deﬁned
on B(Op, δ), we shall consider the (n −1)-dimensional submanifold
B⊥(p, δ) := expp(B⊥(Op, δ))
of M through p which is local transversal at the point p to the trajectory of the
vector ﬁeld passing through the point p. Every point u ∈B⊥(p, δ) can be uniquely
written in the form u = expp(rυ), where υ ∈T ⊥(p) is a vector of length |υ| = 1
and r ∈[0, δ) measures the arc length of the geodesic cp,υ connecting p and u. This
deﬁnes for us a unique representation u = u(r, υ) of a point u ∈B⊥(p, δ).
The main properties of the reparametrization (see Fig.8.1) are summarized in the
following lemmata [21] whose proofs are similar ommited to Lemma 7.8, Chap. 7.

The next lemma states that for any regular point p ∈M of F for the locally

φt restricted to T ⊥(p) satisﬁes (8.56).

the function s(·, ·) : [0, T0] × B⊥(p, ε1) →R+ as given in Lemma 8.7 deﬁnes a
reparametrized local ﬂow φt(u) := ϕs(t,u)(u). Then for all t ∈[0, T0] there holds
dpφt|T ⊥(p) = Z(t, p),
where Z(t, p) denotes the operator solution of (8.56) with Z(0, p) = idT ⊥(p).
8.3.2
Tubular Carathéodory Structure
In this subsection we deﬁne a special Carathéodory structure in the sense of Sect.
3.4.1, Chap. 3, for ﬂow negatively invariant sets on Riemannian manifolds. The outer
measures which arise from this structure will majorize the Hausdorff measures and
will be applied to obtain Hausdorff dimension estimates of ﬂow-invariant sets on the
manifold.
Let (M, g) be a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold and ρ the metric
induced by g. For a piecewise smooth curve c : I →M (I ⊂R an interval) of ﬁnite
length and arbitrary ε > 0 we deﬁne the ε-tubular neighborhood (c, ε) of c by
(c, ε) =

u∈c(I)
B(u, ε),
where B(u, ε) = {p ∈M|ρ (u, p) < ε} is a metric ε-ball on M centered at the point
u. For simplicity we call the ε-tubular neighborhood (c, ε) around the curve c of
length l shortly tube of length l.
For a given compact set K ⊂M and a given number l0 > 0 we denote by Γ (l0) =
{c} a family of piecewise smooth curves of a ﬁnite length l(c) = l0 such that for any
ε > 0 the following condition is satisﬁed:

8.3 Hausdorff Dimension Estimates by Use of a Tubular …
395
(H1) K is contained in the union of ε-tubular neighborhoods (c, ε) with
c ∈Γ (l0).
For a family Γ (l0) satisfying (H1) we deﬁne a family of subsets F, a parameter
set P, and the functions ξ : F × P →[0, ∞), η : F × R →[0, ∞), and ψ : F →
[0, ∞) by
F = {(c, ε) ∩K | c ∈Γ (l0), ε > 0} ∪{∅},
P = [1, +∞),
ξ((c, ε) ∩K, d) := εd−1,
η((c, ε) ∩K, s) := εs,
ψ((c, ε) ∩K) := ε
(8.63)
for c ∈Γ (l0), ε > 0 with (c, ε) ∩K ̸= ∅, ξ(∅, d) = ψ(∅) = 0, and η(∅, s) = 1
for all d ∈P, s ∈R.
Straight forwardly, one can verify that the collection (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) deﬁned via
(8.63) with Γ (l0) satisfying (H1) is a Carathéodory structure on K in the sense of
Sect. 3.4, Chap. 3. In the sequel we will call such a structure simply Carathéodory
structure with tubes of length l0 on K. The next proposition ([21]) shows the rela-
tions between the Carathéodory measures and the Hausdorff measures, as well as
between the Carathéodory dimension, generated by this structure, and the Hausdorff
dimension. For the Rn-case we refer to [18].
Proposition 8.1 Suppose that K is a compact set on the smooth n-dimensional
Riemannianmanifold(M, g).Supposethat(F, P, ξ, η, ψ)isatubularCarathéodory
structure on K with tubes of length l0 deﬁned by (8.63) and with respect to this
structure μC(·, d, ε), μC(·, d), and dimC are the Carathéodory d-measure at level
ε, the Carathéodory d-measure, and the Carathéodory dimension, respectively. Then
there exist two numbers k > 0 and ε0 > 0 depending only on K such that for any set
Y ⊂K and any d ≥1 the inequality
μH(Y, d, ε) ≤l0kμC(Y, d, ε)
(8.64)
holds for all ε ∈(0, ε0]. Therefore, we have
μH(Y, d) ≤l0kμC(Y, d) and thus
dimH Y ≤dimC Y.
As in the previous subsection we shall consider the complete C2-vector ﬁeld
F : M →T M on a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M and the cor-
responding differential equation (8.54) with the global ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R. Let K and 
K be
two compact sets in M satisfying
K ⊂ϕt(K) ⊂
K
for all t ≥0.
(8.65)
At ﬁrst we suppose that the set K does not contain equilibrium points of (8.54).
To construct the family Γ (l0) we can denote by S the set of all equilibrium points
of (8.54) in 
K and set e1 = 1
2dist(Z, K), where dist(Z, K) = inf
u∈Z,
p∈K

K, and the set Z deﬁne the
coefﬁcient
κ(F, 
K, Z) := maxu∈

minu∈Z |F(u)|TuM
.
(8.67)
For any p ∈K we take a time bp > 0 such that ϕt(p) ∈Z for all t ∈[0, bp]. Further,
since dpϕt|t=0 = idTpM we can suppose that |dpϕt| ≤2 holds for all t ∈[0, bp].
Since K is compact and contains no equilibrium points of F there exists a number
e2 > 0 such that for the length of the integral curve pieces it holds l(ϕ(·, p)|[0,bp]) ≥
e2 for any p ∈K. We put
l0 := 1
2 min{e1, e2},
introduce for any q ∈K the number τ(q) > 0 satisfying l(ϕ(·, q)|[0,τ(q)]) = l0, and
deﬁne the set
Γ = { ϕ(·, q)|[0,τ(q)]
| q ∈K}.
(8.68)
Obviously Γ (l0) satisﬁes condition (H1) and (F, P, ξ, η, ψ) deﬁned by (8.63) is
a Carathéodory structure on K.
8.3.3
Dimension Estimates for Sets Which are Negatively
Invariant for a Flow
In the present subsection we derive upper bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of
compact sets being negatively invariant with respect to the ﬂow of (8.54).
Our main result is the following theorem [21].
Theorem 8.7 Let F be the C2-vector ﬁeld (8.54) on the smooth n-dimensional
(n ≥2) Riemannian manifold (M, g) satisfying the following conditions:
(a) The ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R of (8.54) satisﬁes (8.65) with respect to the compact sets K and

K in M, where K does not contain equilibrium points of (8.54).
(b) For any p ∈
K let λ⊥
1 (p) ≥· · · ≥λ⊥
n−1(p) be the eigenvalues of the symmetric
part SA(p) restricted to the subspace T ⊥(p) where A(p) is the operator from
(8.57). There exists a number d ∈(0, n −1], written as d = d0 + s with d0 ∈
{0, 1, . . . , n −2} and s ∈(0, 1], a number Θ > 0, and a time T0 > 0 such that

Then it holds dimH K < d + 1. If d = 1 we have dimH K ≤1.
Before proving Theorem 8.7 let us formulate some lemmata from [21]. For an
arbitrary piecewise smooth curve c : [t1, t2] →M we denote its length by l(c).
Lemma 8.9 Suppose that {ϕt}t∈R is the ﬂow of (8.54), Z and 
K are compact sets in
M, Z does not contain any equilibrium of (8.54), and κ(F, 
K, Z) is the coefﬁcient
from (8.67) and let ct : [t1, t2] →M be the restriction of ϕ(·, p) on [t1, t2] given by
ct(·) := ϕ(t + ·, p)|[t1,t2] and satisfying c0([t1, t2]) ⊂Z and ct([t1, t2]) ⊂
K for all
t > 0. Then the length l(ct) of such a restriction satisﬁes l(ct) ≤κ(F, 

To simplify the use of the reparametrized local ﬂow we cover (γ, ε) by a set
T (γp, ε) as follows. Let for some p ∈K and the associated time t(p) > 0 be γp(·) =
ϕ(·, p)|[0,t(p)] the integral curve of length 2l0 such that γp ⊃γ and for any ε > 0 the

ρ (ϕt(p), φt(u)) = |dpφt| · r(1 + O(r))
as r →0. It holds |dpφt| ≤|dpϕt| and |dpϕt| ≤2 for any t > 0 such that l(ϕ([0, t],

any such t. We can assume analogous assumptions for the ﬂow in reverse time-
direction. Let for ε0(γ ) > 0 the following be satisﬁed : If γ ′ = φ([0, t(p)], u) is

(5) For any u = u(r, υ) ∈B⊥(p, 4ε0(γ )) the deviation arising from the local repar-
ametrization of the ﬂow is of the form s(T0, u(r, υ)) −T0 = O(r) as r →0 which
gives for the point φT0(u) = ϕs(T0,u)−T0(ϕT0(u)) the representation
exp−1
ϕT0(u)(φT0(u)) = OϕT0(u) + F(ϕT0(u))O(r) + o(r)
as r →0. The vector ﬁeld C2-varies on M. So we can suppose that for any point u ∈
B⊥(ϕT0(p), δ) for ν < 24√d0 + 1σε0(γ ) any set (φT0 ◦ϕ−T0)B(u, ν) is contained
in a 2ν-tubular neighborhood of a curve ϕ(·, ϕT0(u))|(−τ,τ) of some ﬁnite length, say
of length l0.
Now letr ≤ε0(γ ). Suppose ϕT0((γ,r)) ∩K ̸= ∅. The set B(p, 4r) is contained
in the open set V. Taylor’s formula for the differentiable map φT0 provides that for

The number N can be estimated from above by
N ≤2d0ωd(E)
αd0+1(E)d .
Thus, any set expϕT0(p)(E) and therefore φT0(B⊥(p, 4r)) can be covered by N
geodesic balls in M of radius 2R. Fixing such a cover {B(u j, 2R)} j≥1 where
u j ∈M ( j ≥1) we choose in every set K ∩B(u j, 2R) ∩B⊥(ϕT0(p), δ) a point u j
and obtain the cover {B j} j≥1 of the set φT0(B⊥(p, 4r)) ∩K with B j = B(u j, 4R) ∩
B⊥(ϕT0(p), δ) .
Now we consider the deviation arising from the reparametrization. By the property
(8.76) any set (φT0 ◦ϕ−T0)(B j) is with precision o(r) (r ≤ε0(γ )) contained in a 4R-
neighborhood of the orbit trough ϕT0(u), or more precise, in an 8R-neighborhood of
a trajectory piece ϕ(·, (ϕT0 ◦φ−T0)(u j))|(−τ,τ) of length l0.
By the choice of ε0(γ ) any trajectory piece in T (γ, 4r) which intersects T (γ,r)
is of maximal length 3l0. We shift the balls B((φT0 ◦ϕ−T0)(u j), 8R) along the ﬂow
lines. Thus, with the above and (8.74) the set ϕT0(T (γ,r)) can be covered by N
tubes of length 3l0κ(F, 

Covering each curve arc by curve arcs of length l0 we conclude

8.3 Hausdorff Dimension Estimates by Use of a Tubular …
401
Although we are mainly interested in upper estimates of the Hausdorff dimension
of ﬂow negatively invariant sets, we can deduce upper bounds of its Carathéodory
dimension with respect to the chosen tubular Carathéodory structure.
Proposition 8.2 Let the differential equation (8.54) satisfy the conditions of Theo-
rem 8.7 with the number d ∈(0, n −1] in (8.69) and the negatively invariant set K.
Then the Carathéodory dimension of K, determined with respect to the Carathéodory
structure (8.63) on K consisting of tubes with length l0 determined in (8.68), satisﬁes
dimC K < d + 1.
Proof It follows from (8.69) that for an arbitrarily small number κ ∈(0, 1) there
exists some number m = m(κ) > 0 such that
k := sup

(8.79)
Without loss of generality we can assume that this number k satisﬁes βk1/d < 1 and
Ck < 1, where β and C are the constants given in (8.70). We choose l > k with
βl1/d < 1 and Cl < 1. Lemma 8.10, applied to the map ϕmT0, guarantees that for
the chosen number l there exists a number ε0 > 0 such that for all ε ∈(0, ε0] the
inequality
μC(ϕmT0(K) ∩K, d + 1, βl1/dε) ≤ClμC(K, d + 1, ε)
(8.80)
holds. Let ε ∈(0, ε0] be arbitrarily small. Since K is compact the value μC(K, d +
1, ε) is ﬁnite. Since K is negatively invariant with respect to ϕmT0 we have K =
ϕmT0(K) ∩K. Using the inequality Cl < 1 we conclude μC(K, d + 1, βl1/dε) <
μC(K, d + 1, ε). By βl1/d < 1 and the fact that μC(K, d + 1, ε) is monotonously
increasingasε →0 + 0,wegetμC(K, d + 1, ε) = 0,whichcontradictsourassump-
tion. Thus, the equality μC(K, d + 1, ε) = 0 holds for every ε ∈(0, ε0]. We see
that μC(K, d + 1) = 0. This implies dimC K ≤d + 1. Since (8.79) holds true if we
slightly reduce d we conclude dimC K < d + 1. s
□
Proof of Theorem 8.4 Applying Propositions 8.1 and 8.2 we obtain dimH K < d +
1. If condition (8.69) is also satisﬁed for d = 1 it is satisﬁed for all d ∈(0, n −1].
Thus,dimH K < d + 1foralld ∈(0, n −1]andweobtaindimH K ≤1.Thisproves
the Theorem.
□
Let us again consider compact sets K and 
K in M satisfying (8.65) with respect
to the ﬂow of (8.54). We may now assume that the set K possesses equilibrium points
and satisﬁes the following condition:
(H2) ThesetK containsatmostaﬁnitenumberofequilibriumpointsof(8.54).Every
such equilibrium point possesses a local stable manifold with a dimension at

least n −1. Trajectories starting in local unstable manifolds or local center
manifolds of such an equilibrium point in K, converge for t →+∞to an
asymptotically stable equilibrium point of (8.54) in 
K.
The special structure of equilibrium points satisfying (H2) allows us to obtain the
following theorem.
Theorem 8.8 Let F be a C2-vector ﬁeld (8.54) on the smooth n-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifold (M, g). Suppose that the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R of (8.54) satisﬁes (8.65)
and condition (H2) with respect to compact sets K and 
K in M. Suppose also that
condition b) of Theorem 8.7 is satisﬁed. Then the conclusion of Theorem 8.7 holds.
In the following statement from [21] we denote for a differentiable function V :
U ⊂M →R, U an open subset, by L FV (p) the Lie derivative of V in p in direction
of the vector ﬁeld F (Sect. A.3, Appendix A).
Corollary 8.11 Suppose that the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R of (8.54) satisﬁes (8.65) and condition
(H2) with respect to compact sets K and 
K in M.
Denote by S the set of equilibrium points of (8.54) in M. For p ∈M\S let
λ⊥
1 (p) ≥· · · ≥λ⊥
n−1(p) be the eigenvalues of the symmetric part SA(p) restricted to
the subspace T ⊥(p), where A(p) is the operator from (8.57), and let V : M\S →R
be a C1-function. Suppose also that for a number d ∈(0, n −1], written as d =

(8.81)

K. Then the conclusion of Theorem 8.7 holds.
Proof On open and ﬂow positively invariant neighborhoods of equilibrium points
of (8.54) which satisfy (H2), the ﬂow preserves its contracting properties with
respect to the Hausdorff measure. So it remains to show that for any compact,
ﬂow negatively invariant set K1 ⊂K which does not contain equilibrium points
of (8.54) it holds dimH K1 < d + 1. On M\S we introduce a new metric tensor by
g(p) := exp

g(p) for p ∈M\S. On K1 the Riemannian metric g is equiv-
alent to g. Changing to the metric g does not alter the Hausdorff dimension of the
compact set K1. Consider the operator A(p) from (8.57), the symmetric part S A(p)
of A(p), the operator ∇F(p), and S∇F(p), which are deﬁned with regard to the
scalar product in TpM induced by the metric g. As in Sect. 7.2, Chap. 7, one shows
that S∇F(p) = S∇F(p) + L F V (p)

lar point p ∈M the eigenvalues λ⊥
i (p) of the operator S A(p)|T ⊥(p) are related to
the eigenvalues λ⊥
i (p), i = 1, . . . , n −1 with respect to the original metric g by

Corollary 8.12 Consider a 2-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold M. Sup-
pose that the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R of (8.54) satisﬁes (8.65) and condition (H2) with respect

K in M. If div F(p) < 0 holds for any regular points p ∈

A(p) from (8.57) it holds that tr(SA(p)|T ⊥(p)) =

of all regular points p in M by V (p) := 1
2 log |F(p)|2. The statement follows with
Corollary 8.11.

8.3.4
Flow Invariant Sets with an Equivariant Tangent
Bundle Splitting
The considered outer measures, deﬁned via tube covers, show in many cases a bet-
ter contraction behaviour under the ﬂow operator of a vector ﬁeld in positive time
direction, than conventional outer measures deﬁned via a covering of balls. Using
such an approach for a class of generalized hyperbolic ﬂows on n-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds, we may improve upper Hausdorff dimension estimates which
are obtained with methods from Sect. 5.2, Chap. 5 and Sect. 8.1.
Consider again the vector ﬁeld (8.54) on the smooth n-dimensional manifold
(M, g). Let us assume that a ﬂow-invariant compact set K ⊂M possesses an equiv-
ariant tangent bundle splitting TKM = E1 ⊕E2 with respect to the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R, i.e.
(see Sect. A.10, Appendix A) for any p ∈K and i = 1, 2 the space Ei
p = Ei ∩TpM
is an ni-dimensional subspace of TpM such that n1 + n2 = n and dpϕt(Ei
p) = Ei
ϕt(p)
hold for any p ∈K and t ∈R.
For d ∈(0, n −n2] and t ∈R we introduce the singular value function of order
d of ϕt on K with respect to the splitting E1 ⊕E2 which is deﬁned by
ωE1,E2
d,K (ϕt) = sup
p∈K
ωd(dpϕt|E1(p)).

Since ωE1,E2
d,K (ϕt) is a sub-exponential function, the limit
νd = lim

t log ωE1,E2
d,K (ϕt)
exists [28] for any d ∈(0, n −n2]. We call the numbers
νu

νu
i := νi −νi−1 ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n −n2
the uniform Lyapunov exponents of the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R with respect to the splitting
E1 ⊕E2. Let us investigate the splitting TKM = E2 ⊕E2 such that E1 = T ⊥with
E1
p := T ⊥(p) and E2 = T ∥with E2
p := T ∥(p) = span{F(p)}.
With the help of Lemma 8.5 one shows that for any regular point p ∈M satisfying
(S∇F(p)z, F(p)) = 0
for all z ∈T ⊥(p)
(8.82)
the n −1 eigenvalues α1(p), . . . , αn−1(p) of SA(p)|T ⊥(p), with the operator A(p)
from (8.57), coincide with n −1 eigenvalues of S∇F(p). The subspace T ∥(p) is the
eigenspace of the remaining nth eigenvalue λ(p) = (∇F(p)F(p), F(p))/|F(p)|2
oF S∇F(p).
We consider now two compact sets K and 
K of M without equilibrium points
of (8.54) satisfying (8.65) and suppose that (8.82) is satisﬁed for any p ∈
K. By
λ1(p) ≥· · · ≥λn(p), denote the eigenvalues of S∇F(p). For that case Theorem
8.3 states that if for some d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] the
inequality
λ1(p) + · · · + λd0(p) + sλd0+1(p) < 0
holds for all p ∈
K, the estimate dimH K < d is true. For the C1-function
V : 
K →R given by V (p) := 1
2 log |F(p)|2 we have L FV (p) = (∇F(p)F(p),
F(p))/|F(p)|2 = λ(p) for each p ∈
K. If λ(p) ≥0 holds for all p ∈
K then
λ1(p) + · · · + λd0(p) + sλd0+1(p) = λ⊥
1 (p) + · · · + λ⊥
d0−1(p) + sλ⊥
d0(p) + L F V (p).
With this Corollary 8.11 gives an upper bound of dimH K which is less than or equal
to the upper bound we would get applying Theorem 8.3. If d = 1 then Corollary 8.11
gives the better estimate dimH K ≤1.
One easily shows that a compact, ﬂow-invariant set K without equilibrium points
possesses an equivariant tangent bundle splitting T ⊥⊕T ∥if and only if (8.82) holds
for any p ∈K. Obviously the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R on K then is already reparametrized
globally if one considers the reparametrization described in Lemma 8.7. For that
case the assumptions of Theorem 8.7 can be weakened if we consider the long-time
behaviour.

Example 8.1 Consider the vector ﬁeld in R2 given by
˙x1 = a sin x1,
˙x2 = −x2 + b ,
(8.83)
where a ≥1, b ̸= 0 are parameters. The arising dynamical system can be interpreted
as a dynamical system on the ﬂat cylinder Z (see Sect. A.1, Appendix A), i.e. on a
2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with the standard metric for factor manifolds.
Every solution of (8.83) is bounded in the second coordinate. Obviously, the set K :=
{z ∈Z|z = [u], u = (x1, 0), x1 ∈R} is compact and ﬂow-invariant with respect to
(8.83). The variational system (8.55) and the system in normal variations (8.56) with
respect to any solution (x1(t), 0) in K are given by
˙y1 = a cos x1(t) · y1 ,
˙y2 = −˙y2 ,
and
˙z1 = −a cos x1(t) · z1 ,
˙z2 = −˙z2 ,
respectively. Thus λ⊥
1 (z) = −1 for any z = (z1, z2) ∈K and condition (8.69) is sat-
isﬁed with d = 1 and Θ = T = 1. By Theorem 8.7 we conclude that dimH K ≤1.
Note that in the present situation Theorem 8.1 is not applicable since the divergence
of the right-hand side of (8.83) is a cos x1 −1 which is, in contrast to the assumptions
of Theorem 8.1, not always negative.

Generalizations of the Theorems of Hartman-Olech
and Borg
Consider an arbitrary C2-vector ﬁeld F in R3 with the standard Euclidean metric,
i.e., the differential equation
˙u = F(u).
(8.84)
Suppose that for (8.84) the global ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R exists. Let K and 
K be two compact
sets in R3 satisfying (8.65). For any u ∈R3 the covariant derivative ∇F(u) can be
identiﬁed with the Jacobi matrix DF(u) of F in u. Suppose that (8.84) possesses
in 
K a ﬁnite number of equilibrium points and for any such equilibrium point u all
eigenvalues of DF(u) have negative real part.
Consider the symmetric part SDF(u) = 1
2 (DF(u) + DF(u)∗) of DF(u). For any
regular point u of F deﬁne the hyperplane T ⊥(u) := {w ∈R3| (w, F(u)) = 0}. Then
the linear operator SA(u) : T ⊥(u) →T ⊥(u) is given for w ∈T ⊥(u) by
SA(u)w := SDF(u)w −
F(u)
|F(u)|2 (SDF(u)w, F(u)).
Denote the eigenvalue of SDF(u), ordered with respect to size and multiplicity, by
λ1(u) ≥λ2(u) ≥λ3(u). Suppose that λ⊥
1 (u) ≥λ⊥
2 (u) are the eigenvalues of SA(u)
restricted to T ⊥(u) and suppose further that λ⊥
1 (u) and λ⊥
2 (u) are not eigenvalues of
SDF(u). It is easy to see that λ⊥
1 (u) and λ⊥
2 (u) are the zeros of the equation

(λI −SDF(u))−1F(u), F(u)

= 0.
We introduce the polynomial
det(λI −DF(u)) ≡λ3 + δ2(u)λ2 + δ1(u)λ + δ0(u).
(8.85)
Let u ∈
K. Note that we have δ2(u) := −(λ1(u) + λ2(u) + λ3(u)), δ1(u) := λ1(u)
λ2(u) + λ2(u)λ3(u) + λ1(u)λ3(u) and δ0(u) := −λ1(u)λ2(u)λ3(u). From this it fol-
lows that the eigenvalues λ⊥
i (u), i = 1, 2, of SA(u) are the zeros of the equation
λ2 + [δ2(u) + Δ1(u)] λ + [δ1(u) + δ2(u)Δ1(u) + Δ2(u)] = 0 ,
where
Δ1(u) := (Df (u)F(u), F(u))
and Δ2(u) :=

DF(u)2F(u), F(u)

.
(8.86)
Using this one sees immediately that the assumptions of Corollary 8.11 are satisﬁed
for (8.84) if we suppose for the function V (u) := 1
2 log |F(u)|2, deﬁned for all regular
points of (8.84), the following condition:

8.3 Hausdorff Dimension Estimates by Use of a Tubular …
407
(H3) There exists a continuous function ζ : 
K →[0, s] with s ∈(0, 1] such that for
any regular point u ∈
K of (8.84) with h(u) := 1−ζ(u)
1+ζ(u) the inequalities
δ2(u) −h(u)Δ1(u) > 0
and
1
4h(u)2 (δ2(u) −h(u)Δ1(u))2 > 1
4 (δ2(u) −Δ1(u))2 −δ1(u) −Δ2(u)
hold.
As a corollary of (H3) we get that if the inequalities
δ2(u) −Δ1(u) > 0
and δ1(u) + Δ2(u) > 0
(8.87)
are satisﬁed for all regular points u of (8.84) on 
K then by Corollary 8.11 it holds
that dimH K ≤1. Further, the set K consists of a ﬁnite number of equilibrium points
and closed trajectories of (8.84).
The Hartman-Olech condition ([11]) requires that λ1(u) + λ2(u) < 0 for all reg-
ular points u ∈
K. Note that this is always sufﬁcient for the condition (8.87).
Let us formulate a further corollary from Theorem 8.8 for the case M = R3.
(H4) Suppose that δ2(u) > 0 for all regular points u ∈
K of (8.84) and that there
exists a continuous function ζ : 
K →[0, s) with s ∈(0, 1] such that the
inequalities
1 + ζ(u)
1 −ζ(u) δ2(u) −Δ1(u) ≥0
and
ζ(u)
(1 −ζ(u))2 δ2(u)2 −
ζ(u)
1 −ζ(u) δ2(u)Δ1(u) + δ1(u) + Δ2(u) ≥0
(8.88)
hold for all regular u ∈
K of (8.84).
Under the condition (H4) it follows from Corollary 8.11 that dimH K < 2 + s.
From Sect.8.1 it follows that a sufﬁcient condition for the dimension estimate
dimH K < 2 + s is the inequality
λ1(u) + λ2(u) + sλ3(u) < 0
for all u ∈
K.
(8.89)
It is easy to show that condition (8.88) is always satisﬁed, supposing that (8.89) is
satisﬁed.

Dimension and Entropy Estimates
for Global Attractors of Cocycles
Abstract Inthischapterwederivedimensionandentropyestimatesforinvariantsets
and global B-attractors of cocycles in non-ﬁbered and ﬁbered spaces. A version of the
Douady-Oesterlé theorem will be proven for local cocycles in an Euclidean space and
for cocycles on Riemannian manifolds. As examples we consider cocycles, generated
by the Rössler system with variable coefﬁcients. We also introduce time-discrete
cocycles on ﬁbered spaces and deﬁne the topological entropy of such cocycles.
Upper estimates of the topological entropy along an orbit of the base system are
given which include the Lipschitz constants of the evolution system and the fractal
dimension of the parameter dependent phase space.

9.1.1
Deﬁnition of a Cocycle
Studying nonautonomous differential equations leads to considering the theory of
cocycles and their attractors ([5, 14–16, 31]). Using the concept of a cocycle it
proves possible to examine random dynamical systems and the corresponding ran-
dom attractors. Elements of the theory of estimates of the Hausdorff dimension of
random attractors were developed in [6, 7, 12]. Cocycles generated by PDE’s were
considered, e.g. in [10, 11, 30]. Dimension-like properties of cocycles given by
variational inequalities with delay are reported in [27].
Suppose T ∈{R, Z, } is a time set, (M, ρM) is a metric space and ({ϕt}t∈T,
(M, ρM)) is the base dynamical system.
Deﬁnition 9.1 Suppose (N, ρN ) is a metric space. The pair

where ψt(u, ·) : N →N,
∀t ∈T+ , ∀u ∈M is a continuous map is called a cocy-
cle over the base system
({ϕt}t∈T,(M, ρM)) ,
(9.2)
if
(1) ψ0(u, ·) = idN ,
∀u ∈M ;
(2) ψt+s(u, ·) = ψt(ϕs(u), ψs(u, ·)),
∀t, s ∈T+ , ∀u ∈M .
Shortly we denote such a system by (ϕ, ψ). Let us introduce the product space

M := M × N with the metric
ρ 
M((u, υ′), (u′, υ′)) :=

ρ2
M(u, u′) + ρ2
N (υ, υ′) or
ρ 
M((u, υ), (u′, υ′)) := max{ρM(u, u′), ρN (υ, υ′)}, ∀(u, υ), (u′, υ′) ∈M × N.
The associated dynamical system (skew product dynamical system)
({ϕt}t∈T, ( 
M, ρ 
M))
(9.3)
is deﬁned by u = (u, υ) ∈M × N →ϕt(u) := (ϕt(u), ψt(u, υ)).
Remark 9.1 Let us show that (9.3) is really a dynamical system:
(1) ϕ0(u, υ) = (ϕ0(u), ψ0(u, υ)) = (u, υ),
∀(u, υ) ∈M × N ;
(2) ϕt+s(u, υ) = (ϕt+s(u), ψt+s(u, υ)) = (ϕt(ϕs(u)), ψt(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ)))
= ϕt(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ)) = ϕt(ϕs(u, υ)) ,
∀t, s ∈T+, (u, υ) ∈M × N.
Example 9.1 Consider the autonomous differential equation
˙ϕ = f (ϕ)
(9.4)
where f : Rn →Rn is a smooth vector ﬁeld. Suppose that for any u ∈Rn there exists
on R the solution ϕ(·, u) satisfying ϕ(0, u) = u. Put ϕt(u) := ϕ(t, u) and M := Rn
with the Euclidean norm | · |. It follows that ({ϕt}t∈R, (Rn, | · |)) is a dynamical
system which will be considered as base system. For any u ∈M the function
(t) := Dϕt(u) is thesolutionof thematrixdifferential equation ˙ = Df (ϕt(u)),
(0) = I. Furthermore, for any υ ∈N := Rn the function ψ(t, υ) := (t)υ is the
solution of the vector differential equation
˙ψ = Df (ϕt(u))ψ, ψ(0) = υ.
Put ψt(u, υ) := Dϕt(u)υ for u ∈M, υ ∈N and t ∈R+. It is easy to see that the
pair (ϕ, ψ) is a cocycle in the sense of Deﬁnition 9.1:
(1) ψ0(u, υ) = Dϕ0(u)υ = υ,
∀u ∈M , υ ∈N ;
(2) ψt+s(u, υ) = Dϕt+s(u)υ = Dϕt(ϕs(u))Dϕs(u)υ = ψt(ϕs(u), Dϕs(u)υ)
= ψt(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ)),
∀u ∈M, υ ∈N, t, s ∈T+ = R+.

(9.5)
where g : R × Rn →Rn is a smooth map. Suppose that for arbitrary u ∈
M := R and υ ∈N := Rn there exists a unique solution ψ(t, u, υ) of (9.5) satisfy-
ing ψ(u, u, υ) = υ. Let us show that ψt(u, υ) := ψ(t + u, u, υ), ∀u ∈R, υ ∈Rn
deﬁnes a cocycle over the base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R (R, | · |)) with ϕt(u) := t + u, ∀t ∈R,
∀u ∈M :
(1) ψ0(u, υ) = ψ(u, u, υ) = υ,
∀u ∈R , ∀υ ∈Rn , i.e.
ψ0(u, ·) = idN ,

(∗) and (∗∗) are solutions of (9.5) with the same initial point at t = 0. Using the
uniqueness property of solutions this shows that (∗) and (∗∗) coincide.
9.1.2
Invariant Sets
Deﬁnition 9.2 (Refs.[14, 15]) Suppose that there is a continuous map M ∋u →
Z(u) ⊂N and {Z(u)}u∈M is a family of sets depending on u. The family 	
Z :=
{Z(u)}u∈M is called closed (compact or bounded) if for every u ∈M the set Z(u) ⊂
N is closed (compact or bounded). The family 	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M is called with respect
to the cocycle (ϕ, ψ) positively invariant if ψt(u, Z(u)) ⊂Z(ϕt(u)), ∀t ∈T+ ,
∀u ∈M(Fig.9.1) negativelyinvariant,ifψt(u, Z(u)) ⊃Z(ϕt(u)), ∀t ∈T+, ∀u ∈

Remark 9.2 Consider in 
M = M × N the map M ∋u →Z(u) ⊂N , i.e., the
set 
Z = {u = (u, υ) ∈
M|u ∈M, υ ∈Z(u)} .
The set 

pose that the cocycle (9.1), (9.2) has a compact globally B-pullback attracting set

9.1.4
Extension System Over the Bebutov Flow on a Hull
Let us consider again equation (9.5). Introduce the shift map for the right-hand side
of (9.5) by
R × M ∋(s, u) →ϕs(u) := g(· + s, ·),
where u = g(t, ·) .
Suppose that M ≡H(g) := {g(· + s, ·) : s ∈R} is the hull of g. The closure is taken
in the compact-open topology . In this topology we have the property hm →h as
m →∞(hm, h : R × Rn →Rn) if and only if for arbitrary compact sets J ⊂R and
K ⊂Rn we have sup(t,υ)∈J ×K |hm(t, υ) −h(t, υ)| →0 as m →∞.
Some properties of the hull:
(1) H(g) is metrizable. Indeed, suppose {	
Km}∞
m=1 is a sequence of compact sets in
R × Rn such that 	
Km ⊂	
Km+1, m = 1, 2, . . . and ∪∞
m=1
	
Km = R × Rn. Then the
metric deﬁned by
ρH(g)(h1, h2) :=
∞

m=1
2−m
sup{|h1(t, υ) −h2(t, υ)| : (t, υ) ∈	
Km}
1 + sup{|h1(t, υ) −h2(t, υ)| : (t, υ) ∈	
Km} ,
for arbitrary h1, h2 ∈H(g) generates a topology in H(g) which is equivalent to
the previous one.
(2) The set H(g) is compact if and only if the map R × Rn ∋(t, υ) →g(t, υ) is
bounded and equicontinuous on every set R × K, where K ⊂Rn is compact.
A function g(t, υ) which is continuous and T-periodic w.r. to t has the last
properties.
On the set M × Rn one considers the evaluation map 	g : M × Rn →Rn given by
M × Rn ∋(u, υ) →u(0, υ), i.e., 	g(ϕt(u), υ). Suppose u = g ∈H(g). Then
	g(ϕt(g), υ) = g(t, υ), i.e., 	g is the extension of g. Instead of the single equation
(9.5) we now consider the family of systems (Bebutov ﬂow)
˙ψ = 	g(ϕt(u), ψ) , u ∈M = H(g) .
(9.6)
Theorem 9.2 (Wakeman [30]) Suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed
for equation (9.5):
(1) The map g : R × Rn →Rn is continuous;
(2) The map R × Rn ∋(t, υ) →g(t, υ) is locally Lipschitz according to the second
argument and there exist measurable integrable functions α(t) and β(t) such
that
|g(t, υ)| ≤α(t) · |υ| + β(t),
∀(t, υ) ∈R × Rn .

9.1 Basic Facts from Cocycle Theory in Non-ﬁbered Spaces
417
Then equation (9.5) generates a cocycle ψ over the Bebutov ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R on the hull
H(g). This cocycle can be written as
ψt(u, υ) = υ +
 t
0
	g(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ))ds ,
∀(u, υ) ∈M × Rn .
The cocycle map ψ(·)(·, ·) : R × M × Rn →Rn is continuous.
Example 9.3 Consider the system
˙ψ = A(t)ψ + h(t, ψ) =: g(t, ψ),
(9.7)
where A(t) is a continuous n × n-matrix function and h : R × Rn →Rn is a con-
tinuous function which satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 9.2. Then there exists
a cocycle ψ generated by (9.7) and given over the Bebutov base ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R on
M = H(g), i.e.,
˙ψ = 	A(ϕt(u))ψ + 	h(ϕt(u), ψ) =: Au(t)ψ + hu(t, ψ) .
(9.8)
Suppose that there exist on R continuous scalar functions c1,u, c2,u, c3,u and constants
c4 > 0 and c0 > 0 such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(A1) (Au(t)υ, υ) ≤−c1,u(t)|υ|2,
∀t ∈R, ∀υ ∈Rn, ∀u ∈M ;
(A2) (hu(t, υ), υ) ≤c2,u(t)|υ|2 + c3,u(t),
∀t ∈R, ∀υ ∈Rn, ∀u ∈M ;
(A3) −c1,u(t) + c2,u(t) ≤−c0 < 0,
∀t ∈R, ∀u ∈M ;
(A4) c3,u(t) ≤c4 < ∞,
∀t ∈R, ∀u ∈M .
Let us show that for (9.8) there exists a global B-pullback attractor. Introduce the
Lyapunov function
V (υ) := 1
2(υ, υ) = 1
2|υ|2,
∀υ ∈Rn.
Suppose that ψ(t) is an arbitrary solution of (9.8) with ﬁxed parameter u. Then we
have
d
dt V (ψ(t)) = (ψ(t), ˙ψ(t)) = (ψ(t), Au(t)ψ(t) + hu(t, ψ(t)))
= (ψ(t), Au(t)ψ(t)) + (ψ(t), hu(t, ψ(t)))
(A1),(A2)
≤
−c1,u(t)|ψ(t)|2 + c2,u(t)|ψ(t)|2 + c3,u(t)
(A3),(A4)
≤
−c0|ψ(t)|2 + c4 = −2c0V (ψ(t)) + c4 .
It follows that
d
dt V (ψ(t)) ≤−2c0V (ψ(t)) + c4,
∀t ∈R .

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Global Attractors of Cocycles
Introduce the function W : Rn →R by V (υ) = W(υ) + c4
2c0 . Then we have
˙V (ψ(t)) = ˙W(ψ(t)) and ˙W(ψ(t)) + 2c0W(ψ(t)) ≤0 ,
∀t ∈R,
and, consequently,
˙W(ψ(t))e2c0t + 2c0e2c0tW(ψ(t)) ≤0,
∀t ∈R.
From this it follows that for arbitrary t0 ≤t we have
 t
t0
d
dt (W(ψ(t))e2c0t) ≤0 .
This gives the estimate
W(ψ(t))e2c0t ≤W(ψ(t0))e2c0t or W(ψ(t)) ≤e2c0(t0−t)W(ψ(t0)) ,
∀t ≥t0 .
For the ﬁrst function V this means that

∀t ≥t0 .
Finally we get the inequality lim supt→∞V (ψ(t)) ≤
c4
2c0 . From this it follows that
the set Z := {υ ∈Rn|υ|2 ≤c4
c0 } is a globally B-forward attracting set for (9.8). Using
Theorem 9.1 we conclude that there exists a unique global B-pullback attractor
	
A = {A(u)}u∈M where A(u)
∀u ∈M, is given by this theorem.

Local Cocycles Over the Base Flow in Non-ﬁbered
Spaces
9.2.1
Deﬁnition of a Local Cocycle
A local cocycle ([19, 23]) on R+ over a base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R, (M, ρM)) is a pair
({ψt(u, ·)}u∈M, t∈[0,β(u,·)), (Rn, | · |)), where ψ(·)(·, ·) is continuous on the set
D = {(t, u, υ) | (u, υ) ∈M × Rn, t ∈[0, β(u, υ))},
and [0, β(u, υ)) is the non-negative part of the maximal interval of existence of
the mapping ψt that passes through the point (u, υ). Here ψ satisﬁes the following
conditions:

9.2 Local Cocycles Over the Base Flow in Non-ﬁbered Spaces

(1) ψ0(u, ·) = idRn,
∀u ∈M,
(2) ψt+s(u, υ) = ψt(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ)), ∀(u, υ) ∈M × Rn, ∀s ∈[0, β(u, υ)),
∀t ∈

0, β(ϕs(u), ψs(u, υ))

, t + s < β(u, υ).
In the following, for brevity, (ϕ, ψ) denotes the local cocycle
({ψt(u, ·)}u∈M, t∈[0,β(u,·)), (Rn, | · |)) on R+ over the base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R,(M, ρM).
Given a mapping M ∋u →Z(u) ⊂Rn, the set
	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M is called
parametrized. A parametrized set 	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M is said to be compact if the set
Z(u) ⊂Rn is compact for any u ∈M.
Deﬁnition 9.4 A set 	
Z is called negatively invariant for a local cocycle (ϕ, ψ) if
there exists 0 < τ < min

υ∈Z(u)
β(u, υ), such that

Upper Bounds of the Hausdorff Dimension for Local
Cocycles
Now we can formulate the main result of this section. Suppose that there is given a
local cocycle (ϕ, ψ) with C1-smooth maps ψt(u, ·) : Rn →Rn for all u ∈M and
t ∈[0, β(u, ·)).
For the subsequent presentation, we need the following assumptions.
(A5) The parametrized set 	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M is compact and negatively invariant for
the local cocycle (ϕ, ψ) with some τ > 0 in the sense of Deﬁnition 9.4 and
Z(u) ⊂Z(ϕτ(u)), u ∈M.
(A6) Given arbitrary points (u, υ) ∈M × Rn and t ∈[0, β(u, ·)), the differential
of the function ψt(u, υ) with respect to υ is denoted by ∂2ψt(u, υ) : Rn →Rn
and satisﬁes the following conditions:
(a) For any ε > 0 and 0 < t < min
u∈M,
υ∈Z(u)
β(u, υ) the function
ηε(t, u) :=
sup
w,υ∈Z(0),
0<|w−υ|≤ε
|ψt(u, w) −ψt(u, υ) −∂2ψt(u, υ)(w −υ)|
|w −υ|
is bounded on M and tends to zero as ε →0 for each ﬁxed t;
(b) For any 0 < t < min
u∈M,
υ∈Z(u)
β(u, υ) we have

sup
υ∈Z(u)
|∂2ψt(u, υ)|op < ∞,
where |L|op denotes the operator norm of an n × n-matrix L.
Theorem 9.3 (Refs.[19, 28]) Under assumptions (A5) and (A6) suppose that:
(1) There exists a compact set 	
K ⊂Rn such that

u∈M
Z(u) ⊂	
K;
(2) There exists a bounded continuous function κ : M × Rn →R+ and a number
d ∈(0, n] such that
sup
(u,υ)∈M×	
K
κ(ϕτ(u), ψτ(u, υ))
κ(u, υ)
ωd(∂2ψτ(u, υ)) < 1 ,
where τ > 0 is the number mentioned in assumption (A5) and ωd is the singular
value function. Then dimH Z(u) ≤d for any u ∈M.
Proof From assumption (2) it follows that there exists a number 0 < κ1 < 1 such
that
sup
υ∈	
K
κ(ϕτ(u), ψτ(u, υ))
κ(u, υ)
ωd(∂2ψτ(u, υ)) ≤κ1 ,
∀u ∈M .
(9.9)
Given an arbitrary m ∈N, we deﬁne
κ(m, u) := κm
1
sup
υ∈Z(0)
κ(ϕτ(u), ψτ(u, υ))
κ(u, υ)
.
(9.10)
Clearly, κ(m, u) can be made arbitrary small for any u ∈M by taking m sufﬁciently
large. In other words, for any l > 0 there exists a sufﬁciently large m0 ∈N such that
0 < κ(m, u) < l,
∀m ≥m0,
∀u ∈M.
(9.11)
Let (a sufﬁciently large) m ≥m0 be ﬁxed. In what follows, the construction of the
mapping ψ is based on solving a system of ordinary differential equations. Since
this solution is given on a compact set M × 	
K, it can be extended to the right in
t. Hence, in subsequent considerations it will be assumed that ψ is deﬁned on the
interval [0, mτ] (for sufﬁciently large m). Hence, by the chain rule for composition,
we get:
∂2ψmτ(u, υ) = ∂2ψτ(ϕ(m−1)τ(u), ψ(m−1)τ(u, υ)) ·
· ∂2ψτ(ϕ(m−2)τ(u), ψ(m−2)τ(u, υ)) · . . . · ∂2ψτ(u, υ).
Using Horn’s inequality (Proposition 2.4, Chap.2), we get

Further, taking into account (9.9) for arguments of the form

κ(u, υ)
κ (ϕmτ(u), ψmτ(u, υ)) ⩽κ(m, u).
(9.13)
From assumption (A6) it follows that, for any ε > 0, u ∈M, and any ﬁxed t = mτ,
ψmt(u, w) −ψmt(u, υ) −∂2ψmt(u, υ)(w −υ)
 ⩽ηε(mτ, u)|w −υ|,
(9.14)
∀u ∈M, ∀w ∈Br(υ), r ⩽ε, w, υ ∈Z(u).
Also, since ηε(t, u) is bounded, there exists ζ such that, for any ε > 0, u ∈M and
ﬁxed 0 < t < min
u∈M,
υ∈Z(u)
β(u, υ) we have ηε(t, u) ≤ζ. Then (9.14) can be replaced by
ψmt(u, w) −ψmt(u, υ) −∂2ψmt(u, υ)(w −υ)
 ⩽ζ|w −υ|,
(9.15)
∀u ∈M, ∀w ∈Br(υ), r ⩽ε, w, υ ∈Z(u).
Since ηε(t, u) −−→
ε→0 0, it follows that ζ can be made arbitrarily small by taking suf-
ﬁciently small ε. Further, by (9.15), we have
ψmτ (u, Br(υ)) ⊂ψmτ(u, υ) + ∂2ψmτ(u, υ)Br(υ) + Brζ(υ).
(9.16)
Put E := ∂2ψmτ(u, υ)Br(υ). It is easily veriﬁed (Proposition 2.2, Chap.2) that E is
an ellipsoid with semiaxes of length ai(E) = rαi(∂2ψmτ(u, υ)), i = 1, . . . , n.
According to (9.11), κ(m, u) can be made arbitrarily small by taking sufﬁciently
large m. Hence there exists a κ2(m) such that κ(m, u) ⩽κ2(m), ∀u ∈M. Clearly,
κ2(m) can also be made arbitrarily small by taking large m.
We apply Lemma 2.1, Chap.2 with κ = κ2(m), and take arbitrary δ so that we have
sup
υ∈Z(u)
|∂2ψmτ(u, υ)| ⩽δ and κ2(m) ⩽δd for a sufﬁciently large m. Also, we choose
a small ζ so that

It is then easily veriﬁed that the parameters κ′ := rdκ2(m), δ′ := rδ, η′ := rζ satisfy
the hypotheses of Lemma 2.1, Chap.2. Then, by this lemma we have

is
a countable covering of Z(u) by balls of radii r j ⩽ε, then we can build a countable
covering of ψmτ(u, Z(u)) by ellipsoids E′
j, for which ωd(E′
j) ⩽lrd
j .
Let us introduce some new notation: for any compact set K ⊂Rn we deﬁne
	μH(K, d, ε) := inf 
j
ωd(E′
j), the inﬁmum being taken over all countable coverings
of K by ellipsoids E′
j, for which ωd(E′
j) ⩽εd.
From the deﬁnitions of 	μH, μH and inequality (9.18), we get
	μH

ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d,l1/dε

⩽lμH(Z(u), d, ε).
(9.19)
Using Lemma 2.1. of Chap.2, once again, for a countable covering of the compact
set K by ellipsoids E j, for which

ωd(E j)
1/d ⩽ε, we obtain the following estimate:

μH

Hence, taking the inﬁmum, we obtain

K, d,

⩽2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 	μH(K, d, ε).
(9.20)
We apply (9.20) and then (9.19) to the set K = ψmτ(u, Z(u)). This gives
μH

ψmτ (u, Z(u)), d,

(9.21)
Assume that μH(Z(u), d) ⩽μ0 < ∞and take ε →0 in (9.21). It follows that

Recall that l is an (arbitrarily small) positive number, for which a sufﬁciently large m
was chosen so that we were able to apply the above estimates. Hence, for a sufﬁciently
large m, the right-hand side of (9.22) can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, for
each u ∈M, we have shown that if μH(Z(u), d) < ∞, then

lim
ε→0 μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d, ε) = 0.
(9.23)
Further, sincel is an arbitrary number, it may be assumed that it satisﬁes the following
restrictions: √d0 + 1l1/d < 1 and 2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 l < 1. In this case, we have
μH(Z(u), d, ε) ⩽μH

Z(u), d,

(9.24)
By assumption (A5) of the theorem, Z(u) ⊂Z(ϕτ(u)) ⊂. . . ⊂Z(ϕmτ(u)), and so
μH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ⩽μH(Z(ϕmτ(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).
(9.25)
Further, 	
Z is negatively invariant by assumption (A5). In other words, Z(ϕmτ(u)) ⊂
ψmτ(u, Z(u)). Hence,
μH(Z(ϕmτ(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ⩽μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).
(9.26)
Also, it follows from (9.21) that
μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ⩽2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 lμH(Z(u), d, ε).
(9.27)
Combining together (9.25), (9.26),(9.27), and (9.24), we obtain
μH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ⩽2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 lμH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε), (9.28)
where the factor 2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 l is strictly less than 1 by the choice of l.
It follows that μH(Z(u), d, √d0 + 1l1/dε) can only be 0 for all u ∈M. Making
ε →0,wegetμH(Z(u), d) = 0, ∀u ∈M.Hence,bythedeﬁnitionoftheHausdorff
dimension, dimH Z(u) ⩽d, ∀u ∈M.
□
Remark 9.3 Using the results of Sect. 5.4, Chap.5 for fractal dimension estimates of
negatively invariant sets of dynamical systems together with the above technique it is
possible to get a similar estimate for the fractal dimension of negatively invariant sets
of cocycles ([9]). A different approach for fractal dimension estimates is developed
in [17].

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Global Attractors of Cocycles
where g : R × Rn →Rn is a Ck-smooth (k ⩾2) vector ﬁeld. Relative to the vector
ﬁeld (9.29) we introduce the hull of g deﬁned by
H(g) = {g(· + t, ·), t ∈R},
where the closure is taken in the compact open topology.
We assume that H(g) is compact. For this, it sufﬁces to require that g(t, υ) in (9.29)
is not only smooth in υ but also almost periodic in t.
Using the map 	g, introduced in Subsect. 9.1.4, we can associate with system (9.29)
the following family of vector ﬁelds
˙ψ = 	g(ϕt(u), ψ),
(9.30)
where u ∈H(g) is arbitrary. The initial system (9.29) is contained in (9.30) as a
special case.
Using, for example, almost periodicity in t of the map (t, υ) →g(t, υ) and consider-
ing the above assumptions, one may show that for (9.30) there exists a local cocycle
({ψt(u, ·)}u∈H(g), t∈[0,β(u,·)), (Rn, | · |)) over the base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R, (H(g), ρ)) (see
[30]), where ψt is given in terms of the solution operator of system (9.30), and
[0, β(u, υ)) is the non-negative part of the maximal interval of existence of the
motion passing through the point (u, υ) ∈M × Rn. For a point (u, υ) ∈M × Rn
let ψ(t, υ) be the solution of the variational equation along the trajectory of the
cocycle through the point (u, υ); this is the solution of the equation
˙ψ = ∂2	g(ϕt(u), ψt(u, υ))ψ
(9.31)
with the initial condition ψ(0, ψ0) = ψ0 ∈Rn. Hence ∂2ψt(u, υ)w = ψ(t, w) for
0 ⩽t < β(u, υ). Let λ1(u, υ) ⩾λ2(u, υ) ⩾· · · ⩾λn(u, υ) be the ordered eigen-
values of the matrix 1

Theorem 9.4 (Refs.[19, 28]) Suppose that the local cocycle (ψ, ϕ) generated by
the differential equation (9.29) over the Bebutov ﬂow satisﬁes assumption (A5) and
the following conditions:

Then dimH Z(u) ⩽d for all u ∈M.
The proof of this theorem and the following one goes parallel to the proof of The-
orem 5.5 and Corollary 5.4, Chap.5, for dynamical systems and is omitted here.
For a number d = d0 + s with d0 ∈[0, n −1] integer and s ∈(0, 1] and logarithmic
norm Λ on the space of n × n-matrices we introduce as in Sect. 2.4, Chap.2, the
partial d-trace w.r.t Λ of the map ∂2	g : M × Rn →Rn by

for u ∈M, υ ∈Rn.
Theorem 9.5 (Refs.[19,

d0 ∈[0, n −1], a real s ∈(0, 1], a logarithmic norm Λ and a continuously dif-
ferentiable on

Remark 9.4 In a similar way as in Chap. 6 we could introduce different types of
Lyapunov exponents for cocycles and consider the concept of Lyapunov dimension
and Lyapunov dimension formula ([18]).

Here, for brevity,
au(t) ≡	a(ϕt(u)) ,
bu(t) ≡	b(ϕt(u)).
Since system (9.32) has all the properties of system (9.29), it generates a local cocycle
({ψt(u, ·)}u∈H(g),t∈[0,β(u,υ)), (Rn, | · |)) over the base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R, (H(g), ρH(g))),
where [0, β(u, υ)) is the non-negative part of the maximal interval on which there
exits a solution of (9.35) passing through the point (u, υ) ∈M × Rn. Assume
that, for this cocycle, there exists a compact set

where C is a term which can be directly calculated by means of the parameters
a0, b0, ε,l and m of the system and which is bounded from above for all small ε > 0.
In order to use Theorem 9.3 effectively we need to ﬁnd the minimal s for which the
inequality (9.40) still holds. Thus, from (9.40), (9.48) and Theorem 9.3 it follows
that

The Douady-Oesterlé Theorem for Cocycles on a Finite
Dimensional Riemannian Manifold
Suppose that (N, ρN ) is a smooth m-dimensional Riemannian manifold, (M, ρM)
is a complete metric space, ψt(u, ·) : N →N, u ∈M, t ∈R is a family of smooth
maps and ϕt : M →M is a continuous base system.
To formulate the next theorem, we need the following assumptions.
(A7) The set 	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M is compact and negatively invariant w.r.t the cocycle.

Theorem 9.6 (Ref.[23]) Under the assumptions (A7), (A8) suppose additionally
that:
(1) There exists a set 	
K ⊂N such that

(2) There exists a bounded function κ : M × N →R+ \ {0}, numbers τ > 0 and

κ(u, υ)
ωd(∂2ψτ(u, υ)) < 1
(9.52)
and Z(u) ⊂Z(ϕτ(u)), u ∈M. Then dimH Z(u) ≤d for all u ∈M.
Proof From assumption (2) of Theorem 9.6 it follows that there exist a bounded

that

Thus, for all u ∈M
sup

κ(ϕτ(u), ψτ(u, υ))
κ(u, υ)
ωd(∂2ψτ(u, υ)) < 1.
Then there exists a number 0 < κ1 < 1, such that for all u ∈M

In other words, for all l > 0 there exists m0 ∈N such that
0 ≤κ(m, u) ≤l,
∀m ≥m0, u ∈M.
(9.55)
Let m ≥m0 be a sufﬁciently large ﬁxed number. By the chain rule, we get

Further, with the use of (9.53) for (ϕ(m−j)τ(u), ψ(m−j)τ(u, υ)), j = 1, . . . , m −1,
we have the following estimates
ωd(∂2ψτ(u, υ)) ≤κ1 ·

By taking ε sufﬁciently small we can make ζ arbitrary small. Let E :=

Now we need to verify the conditions of Lemma 7.1, Chap.7. Recall that

By the Fischer-Courant theorem (Theorem 7.1, Chap.7) we have
α1(∂2ψmτ(u, υ)) =

From (9.57) it follows that
ωd(∂2ψmτ(u, υ)) ≤κ(m, u) ≤κ(m),
hence,
ωd(E) ≤rdκ(m).
Furthermore, κ(m) ≤δd and rdκ(m) ≤(rδ)d.
The conditions of Lemma 7.1, Chap.7, hold for κ′ := rdκ(m), δ′ := rδ, η′ := rζ. It
follows that the set E + B(0,rζ) is contained in the ellipsoid E′ with

If {B(υ j,r j)} is a countable covering of Z(u) by balls of radius r j ≤ε we can

μH(E j, d,

Applying (9.61) to the set K = ψmτ(u, Z(u)), we get

2d0(d0 + 1)d/2	μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d,l1/dε) ≤m2d0(d0 + 1)d/2lμH(Z(u), d, ε).
Assuming that μH(Z(u), d) ≤μ0 < ∞and taking ε →0, we obtain
μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d) ≤2d0(d0 + 1)d/2lμH(Z(u), d) ≤2d0(d0 + 1)d/2lμ0.
(9.63)
Recall that l is an arbitrary small positive number, for which we chose a sufﬁciently
large number m so that we were able to apply the above estimates. Hence, for a sufﬁ-
ciently large m the right-hand side of (9.63) can be made arbitrary small. Therefore,
for all u ∈M, we have shown that if μH(Z(u), d) < ∞, then
lim
ε→0 μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d) = 0.
As l is an arbitrary number we can assume that it satisﬁes

d0 + 1l1/d < 1,
and
2d0(d0 + 1)d/2l < 1.
In that case
μH(Z(u), d, ε) ≤μH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).

By assumption of the theorem, Z(u) ⊂Z(ϕτ(u)) ⊂. . . ⊂Z(ϕmτ(u)). This leads
to the inequality
μH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ≤μH(Z(ϕmτ(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).
(9.65)
By assumption (A7), 	
Z is negatively invariant, which means that Z(ϕmτ(u)) ⊂
ψmτ(u, Z(u)). Then
μH(Z(ϕmτ(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ≤μH(ψmτ(u, Z(u)), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).
(9.66)
From (9.62), we have
μH(ψmτ(u, Z), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε) ≤2d0(d0 + 1)d/2lμH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε).
(9.67)
Combining (9.64), (9.65), (9.66) and (9.67), we obtain
μH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1,l1/dε) ≤2d0(d0 + 1)d/2lμH(Z(u), d,

d0 + 1l1/dε),
(9.68)
where 2d0(d0 + 1)d/2l is strictly less that 1 by the choice of l.
From here we get that μH(Z(u), d, √d0 + 1l1/dε) can only be 0 for all u ∈M.
Taking ε →0 we have μH(Z(u), d) = 0 for all u ∈M. Hence, by the deﬁnition of
the Hausdorff dimension, dimH Z(u) ≤d, for all u ∈M.

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Global Attractors of Cocycles
Let us give a generalization of the Douady-Oesterlétheorem ([8]) to the case of
discrete time cocycles on a ﬁnite-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The proof of
the theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 9.6 and omitted here.
Theorem 9.7 (Ref.[22]) Let assumptions (A9), (A10) and the following conditions
hold for the cocycle (ϕ, ψ):
(1) There exists a compact set 	
K ∈N such that

u∈M
Z(u) ⊂	
K;
(2) There exists a continuous bounded function κ : M × N →R+\{0}, a time
j > 0, and a number d ∈(0, n] such that
sup
(u,υ)∈M×	
K
κ(ϕ j(u), ψ j(u, υ))
κ(u, υ)
ωd(∂2ψ j(u, υ)) < 1.
(9.69)
Then dimH Z(u) ⩽d for each u ∈M.
The following theorem generalizes the result obtained in [24] to the case of discrete-
time cocycles.
Theorem 9.8 (Ref.[22]) Assume that the set {K(u)}u∈M is a negatively invariant
for a discrete-time cocycle (ϕ, ψ), K(u) ⊂K(ϕ(u)), u ∈M, and let D ⊂N be an
open set such that (
u∈M
K(u) ⊂D.
Assume that there exists a continuous function κ : D →R+, satisfying the following
conditions:
(1) (w, (∂2ψ(u, υ))∗∂2ψ(u, υ)w)TυN ⩾κ2(u, υ)(w, w)TυN ,
∀u ∈M,
∀υ ∈K(u),
∀w ∈TυN;
(2)
sup
u∈M,υ∈K(u)
| det ∂2ψ(u,υ)|
κ(u,υ)n−1
< 1.
Then dimH(K) < d.
Proof Consider the tangent mapping ∂2ψ(u, ·) : TυN →Tψ(u,υ)N. For each square
of singular number α2
i := α2
i (u, υ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n of the linear operator ∂2ψ, there
exists an eigenvector wi = wi(u, υ) ∈TυN such that
(∂2ψ(u, υ))∗∂2ψ(u, υ)wi = α2
i wi.
It follows from assumption (1) that
α2
i (u, υ) ⩾κ2(u, υ),
i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
u ∈M,
υ ∈K(u),

whence
α1(u, υ) · . . . · αk(u, υ)κ(u, υ)n−k ⩽| det ∂2ψ(u, υ)|
(9.71)
for any k ∈{1, . . . , n}. From this we ﬁnd that κ(u, υ)n ⩽| det ∂2ψ(u, υ)|. Using
assumption (2) of the theorem, we obtain the inequality
ωd(∂2ψ(u, υ)) ⩽| det ∂2ψ(u, υ)|
κ(u, υ)n−d
< 1.
The assertion of Theorem 9.8 follows now from Theorem 9.7.
□
Let us present an example demonstrating the application of Theorem 9.8 to the Hénon
system for the case of parameters depending on some base systems on a metric space.
A similar example for constant parameters can be found in [24].
Example 9.4 Consider the time-varying Hénon system
) xk+1 = 1 −akx2
k + yk,
yk+1 = bkxk,
k ∈Z+,
(9.72)
where {ak}∞
k=0 and {bk}∞
k=0 are sequences of the form ak = a +	ak and bk = b + 	bk.
Here a and b are positive parameters and {	ak} and {	bk} are bounded sequences
satisfying the inequalities
|	ak| ⩽εa
and |	bk| ⩽εb,
k ∈Z+,
where ε ∈(0, 1) is a small parameter.
Together with system (9.72), consider the family of systems
) xk+1 = 1 −au(k)x2
k + yk,
yk+1 = bu(k)xk,
k ∈Z+,
(9.73)
where we write au(k) = 	a(ϕk(u)) and bu(k) = 	b(ϕk(u)) for brevity. Here
({ϕk}k∈Z, (M, ρM))
(9.74)
is a base system on a compact metric space (M, ρM) and 	a,	b : M →R+ are
continuous functions.
Let (ϕ, ψ) be the cocycle generated by systems (9.72) and (9.74). Assume that there
exists a compact invariant set 	
K = {K(u)}u∈M for (ϕ, ψ). Using Theorem 9.8, we
estimate the Hausdorff dimension from above. Let υ = (x, y); then
∂2ψ(u, υ) =
−2aux 1
bu
0
 
.
Hence | det ∂2ψ(u, υ)| = bu for all u ∈M, υ ∈K. For d = 1 + s, s ∈[0, 1], con-
sider the function of the singular numbers α1(u, x) and α2(u, x) given by

Frequency Conditions for Dimension Estimates for
Discrete Cocycles
Consider the system ([1, 2, 20–22, 26])
υk+1 = Aυk + Bφ(k, wk),
wk = C∗υk,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
(9.75)
where A is a constant n × n matrix and B and C are constant n × m matrices.
Further, let D ⊂Rm be an open pathwise connected set and let φ : Z × D →Rm be
a nonlinear mapping smooth in the second argument.
Together with (9.75), consider the cocycle (ϕ, ψ). Thus, we have a cocycle that is
described via the family of systems
υk+1 = Aυk + B	φ(ϕk(u), wk),
wk = C∗υk,
u ∈M k = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (9.76)
Let W(z) = C∗(A −zI)−1B, z ∈C: det(A −zI) ̸= 0, be the transfer function of
the linear part of system (9.75).
The following theorem generalizes the result from [24] to the case of discrete cocy-
cles.
Theorem 9.9 (Refs.[21, 22]) Let {K(u)}u∈M be a compact negatively invariant
set for the cocycle (ϕ, ψ) such that (
u∈M
K(u) ⊃K and K(u) ⊂K(ϕ(u)), u ∈M.
Assume that the pair (A, B) is controllable and the pair (A, C) is observable. Sup-
pose that there exist numbers d ∈(0, n], λ > 0, and δ > 0 such that the following
conditions hold.

Then dimH(K) < d for each u ∈M.
To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma.
Lemma 9.1 Let δ > 0 and λ > 0 be real numbers with respect to which the pair
(A, B) of system (9.76) is controllable and the pair (A, C) is observable, and let
conditions (1) −−(3) of Theorem 9.9 be satisﬁed. Then there exists a real negative
deﬁnite n × n matrix P = P∗such that
∂2ψ(u, υ)∗P∂2ψ(u, υ) ⩽λ2P,
∀(u, υ) ∈M × D.
Proof Consider the quadratic form
F(υ, ξ) := −ξ ∗C∗υ + δ|C∗υ|2,
ξ ∈Rm,
υ ∈Rn.
(9.77)
It follows from the assumptions of the lemma that the pair ( 1
λ A,
√
δC) is observable
and the inverse matrix (zI −1
λ A) exists for all z ∈C with |z| = 1. Consider the
following Hermitian extension of the quadratic form F :
FC(υ, ξ) = −Re(ξ ∗C∗υ) + δ|C∗υ|2,
ξ ∈Rm,
υ ∈Rn.

the inequality

λ2 (Aυ + Bξ)∗P(Aυ + Bξ) −υ∗Pυ −ξ ∗C∗υ + δ|C∗υ|2 ⩽0 ,

For arbitrary u ∈M and υ1, υ2 ∈D, set υ = υ1 −υ2 and ξ = 	φ(u, C∗υ1) −
	φ(u, C∗υ2). Then we obtain

Consider
the
non-autonomous ordinary differential equation

441
˙ψ = g(t, ψ),
(9.81)
where g : R × N →T N is a Ck-smooth (k ≥2) non-autonomous vector ﬁeld. We
extend this system to a Bebutov ﬂow. Deﬁne for this the hull H(g) of g as
H(g) = {g(· + t, ·), t ∈R}
and the evaluation map 	g as
˙ψ = 	g(ϕt(u), ψ),
u ∈M,
(9.82)
where M := H(g). The initial equation is contained in the extended system as u = g.
Assume that equation (9.82) with initial condition t0 ∈R, υ0 ∈N has a unique
continuous solution υ(·, t0, υ0) deﬁned on R+ and υ(t0, υ0, υ0) = υ0. Under this
assumption equation (9.82) generates the cocycle

{ψt(u, ·)u∈M,t∈R+}, (N, ρN )

over the base ﬂow ({ϕt}t∈R, (M, ρM)).
Now we deﬁne the linearization of the cocycle. Let w(t, u0, υ0) be a solution of the
variation equation along the trajectory of the cocycle through the point (u0, υ0) ∈
M × N. This variation equation has the form
˙w = ∇2	g(ϕt(u0), ψt(u0, υ0))w,
w(0, u0, w0) = w0 ∈Tυ0N
(9.83)
where ∇2	g(·, ·) : T N →T N is the covariant derivative with respect to the second
argument. Then
∂2ψt(u0, υ0)(w0) = w(t, u0, w0)
for all t ∈R+. Thus, ∂2ψt(u0, υ0)(w0) is a fundamental matrix of the (9.83).
Let λ1(u, υ) ≥λ2(u, υ) ≥. . . ≥λn(u, υ) be the eigenvalues of

each eigenvalue appears pi times, where pi is the eigenvalue’s algebraic multiplicity.
Theorem 9.10 (Ref.[23]) Assume that
(1) (A7), (A8) with M = H(g) holds;
(2) there exists a compact set 	
K ⊂N, such that

u∈H(g)
Z(u) ⊂

(3) there are a continuous function V : H(g) × N →R, such that the derivative

dt V (ϕt(u), ψt(u, υ) exists, a number τ > 0 and a number
d ∈(0, n], d = d0 + s, where d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1}, s ∈(0, 1], such that

Then dimH Z(u) ≤d for all u ∈H(g).
Proof To prove Theorem 9.10, we need to show the existence of a function
κ : H(g) × N →R+, such that (9.52) holds.
Recall that ∂2ψt(u, υ) is a solution of the variation equation
˙w = ∇2	g(ϕt(u), ψt(u, υ))w,
(9.84)
Lets ﬁx u ∈H(g) k ∈N. For all t we have

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Global Attractors of Cocycles
9.3.5
Upper Bounds for the Hausdorff Dimension of
Attractors of Cocycles Generated by Differential
Equations on the Cylinder
Supposethatφ(·, ·) : R × R →Risabounded,smoothand2π-periodicwithrespect
to the second argument function, A is a stable (n −1) × (n −1)-matrix (i.e. for all
eigenvalues of A we have Re λ < 0); c and b are (n −1)-vectors.
Let us consider the differential equation ([1, 2, 20])
˙θ = c∗y,
˙y = Ay + bφ(t, θ).
(9.91)
It is well-known that instead of (9.91) we can consider a differential equation on the
cylinder (C, ρC)). With υ = (θ, y) and g(t, υ) = (c∗y, Ay + bφ(t, θ))T equation
(9.91) can be represented as
˙υ = g(t, υ), υ ∈C.
(9.92)
From Subsect. 9.3.4 we can consider the evaluation map 	g and the equation
˙υ = 	g(ϕt(u), υ),
(9.93)
which generates a cocycle ({ψt(u, ·)}u∈H(g), (C, ρC)) over the Bebutov ﬂow
({ϕt(·)}t∈R, (H(g), ρH(g))), where H(g) is the hull of g.
For a ﬁxed u0 ∈H(g) let υ(·, t0, u0, υ0) = (θ(·, t0, u0, θ0, y0), y(·, t0, u0, θ0, y0)) be
the solution of (9.93) such that υ(t0, t0, u0, υ0) = u0, where υ0 = (y0, θ0).
We have for t ≥t0 the estimates
|υ(t, t0, u0, υ0)|C ≤|θ(t, t0, u0, θ0, y0)| + |y(t, t0, u0, θ0, y0)|
≤2π + |y(t, t0, q0, θ0, y0)|,
where | · | is the Euclidean norm.
Since A is a stable matrix, there exist ε > 0, C2 > 0 such that |eAt| ≤C2e−εt for all
t > 0. By the Cauchy formula we have
|y(t, t0, u0, θ0, y0)| ≤|e(t−t0)Ay0| +

t

e(t−t0−τ)Abφ(τ, θ)dτ

.
From the stability of A we deduce that |e(t−t0)Ay0| →0 as t →+∞. From the
boundedness of φ(t, θ) we get that there is a C1 > 0 such that |φ(t, θ)| ≤C1 for all
t, θ. Then for all t > t0 we have

(9.94)
Thus, the cocycle ({ϕt(·)}t∈R, (H(g), ρH(g))) has a unique global B-forward
attractor 	
A.
Example 9.5 Consider the differential equation
˙θ = cy,
˙y = ay + bφ(t, θ),
(9.95)
where a < 0, b ∈R, c > 0 are some parameters, φ(·, ·) : R × R →R is a bounded
and 2π-periodic in the second argument smooth function. Instead of (9.95) we con-
sider the family of systems
˙θ = cy ,
˙y = ay + b	φ(ϕt(u), θ)
(9.96)
where 	φ : R × S1 →R is the extension of φ to the hull H(φ). Let us write system
(9.96) in the form
˙θ = cy ,
˙y = ay + bφu(t, θ)
(9.97)
From Theorem 9.2 it follows that equation (9.96) generates a cocycle (ϕ, ψ) on
the phase space R × S1. Using Theorem 9.1 we see that this cocycle has a global
B-attractor 	
A. In order to get a dimension estimate we use Theorem 9.10 with V ≡1.
Suppose that λ1,u(t, y1, y2) ≥λ2,u(t, y1, y2) are the eigenvalues of the symmetrized

Discrete-Time Cocycles on Fibered Spaces

Deﬁnition of Cocycles on Fibered Spaces
Assume that

{ϕk}k∈Z, (M, ρM)

is a dynamical system on the complete metric
space (M, ρM) which is called again base system. Let {(N(u), ρu)}u∈M be a fam-
ily of complete metric spaces. The family of maps ψk(u, ·) : N(u) →N(ϕk(u)) is
called discrete-time cocycle over the base system ([12, 15]) if the following condi-
tions are satisﬁed:
(1) ψ0(u, ·) = idN(u);
(2) ψk+ j(u, ·) = ψk(ϕ j(u), ψ j(u, ·)),
∀k, j ∈Z+ , u ∈M ;
(3) For any k ∈Z+, u ∈M the map ψk(u, ·) : N(u) →N(ϕk(u)) is continuous.
Example 9.6 Suppose M is a Cs-smooth m-dimensional Riemannian manifold,
ρM is the metric, ϕ : M →M is a Cr-diffeomorphisms, 1 ≤r ≤s . Introduce the
base system

Let us consider the differential duϕk : TuM →Tϕk(u)M given by (see Appendix A)
duϕk([u, x, ξ]) :=

ϕk(u), y, (y ◦ϕk ◦x−1)′(x(u))ξ

where x is a chart around u, y is a chart around ϕk(u) and ξ ∈Rm is an arbitrary
vector. Introduce the map ψk(u, υ) := duϕk(υ), where υ = [u, x, ξ] ∈TuN, and
the spaces N(u) := Tu Q. It follows that
ψk(u, ·) : N(u) →N(ϕk(u))
∀k ∈Z+, ∀u ∈M .

As it is easy to see we have the cocycle property
ψk+ j(u, υ) = duϕk+ j(υ) = dϕ j(u)ϕk(duϕ j(υ))
= ψk(ϕ j(u), duϕ j(υ)) = ψk(ϕ j(u), ψ j(u, υ)),

Global Pullback Attractors
Let 	
D be a family of parametrized subsets {D(u)}u∈M, D(u) ⊂N(u). We call a
system 	
D inclusion closed ([12]) if it fulﬁlls the properties.
(1) If D ∈	
D then for any u ∈M the set D(u) ⊂N(u) is non-empty.
(2) If D ∈	
D and ∅̸= D′(u) ⊂D(u) for any u ∈M then 	
D′ ∈	
D.
A parametrized set 	
Z = {Z(u)}u∈M ∈	
D is called D-absorbing if for any D ∈
	
D, u ∈M, there exists k0 = k(u, D) such that ψk(ϕk(u), D(ϕk(u)) ⊂Z(u) if
k ≥k0. It follows from this deﬁnition that the domain of the cocycle operators in
(9.102) in N(ϕ−k(u)), k ≥0, is depending on k. But the image set is always con-
tained in N(u). Thus, we can study ω-limit sets contained in a ﬁxed ﬁbre N(u). A
parametrized family 	
A = {A(u)}u∈M ∈	
D is called global D- pullback attractor if
for any u ∈M
ψk(u, A(u)) = A(ϕk(u)) for k ∈Z+
and

Theorem 9.11 (Ref.[12]) Let {(N(u), ρu)}u∈M be a family of complete metric
spaces. The family of operators {ψk(u, ·)}u∈M is deﬁned to be a cocycle over the
ﬂow {ϕk}k∈Z fulﬁlling (9.102). The maps ψk(u, ·), u ∈M, k ∈Z+, are assumed
to be continuous. Moreover, we assume the existence of a D-absorbing set 	
Z =
{Z(u)}u∈M. Each of these sets Z(u), u ∈M, is supposed to be compact. Then the
cocycle {ψk(u, ·)}u∈M

The Topological Entropy of Fibered Cocycles
The basic properties of topological entropy for cocycles are considered in
[9, 16, 25]. Topological entropy estimates for systems with multiple time are con-
sidered in [4].
(a) The Characterization by Open Covers
Suppose that (N, ρN ) and (N ′, ρN ′) are compact metric spaces, ψ : N →N ′ is a
continuous map. Suppose also that U and U′ are open covers of N and N ′ respectively.

Dimension and Entropy Estimates for Global Attractors of Cocycles
Denote by N(U)(resp. N(U′)) the minimal number of elements U(resp. U′) necessary
for the covering of N(resp. N ′) and deﬁne
H(U) := log N(U)
(9.103)
(resp.H(U′) := log N(U′)) .
The next lemma is an analogon of Lemma 3.6, Chap.3.
Lemma 9.2 Suppose ψ : N →N ′ is continuous, (N, ρN ) and (N ′, ρ′
N ) are com-
pact metric spaces, U′ and V′ are open covers of N ′. Then the following holds:
(1) ψ−1(U′ ∨V′) = ψ−1U′ ∨ψ−1V′;
(2) H(U′) ≤H(U′ ∨V′) ≤H(U′) + H(V′);
(3) H(ψ−1U′) ≤H(U′);
(4) H(ψ−1U′) = H(U′)
if ψ is surjective.
Proof The proof of the lemma follows directly from the deﬁnitions.
□
Let us assume that the parametrized metric spaces {(N(u), ρu)}u∈M are compact.
Suppose that γ (u) = {ϕk(u), k ∈Z} is the orbit of ϕ through u ∈M. Let us ﬁx a
point u ∈M and consider the family of open covers Uu := {U(u′)}u′∈γ (u) such that
U(u′) is an open cover of N(u′), where u′ ∈γ (u). We deﬁne the topological entropy
of the cocycle (ϕ, ψ) along the orbit through u with respect to the family of open
covers Uu as
htop((ϕ, ψ), u, Uu) := lim sup
m→∞
log N
m−1

It is easy to see that the following lemma is true.
Lemma 9.3 htop((ϕ, ψ), u, Uu) = htop((ϕ, ψ), ϕ1(u), Uu), ∀u ∈M.
From this we get immediately the next result:
Proposition 9.1 For any u ∈M and k ∈Z we have
htop((ϕ, ψ), u, Uu) = htop((ϕ, ψ), ϕk(u), Uu)
Let us take new covers Uu = {U(u′)}u′∈γ (u) for which the maximal diameter of
U(ϕk(u)) converges to zero for k →∞. Then we can get arbitrary large values
of htop((ϕ, ψ), u, Uu)). To avoid this effect we introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 9.5 The topological entropy of the cocycle (ϕ, ψ) along the orbit through
u is deﬁned by
htop((ϕ, ψ), u) := sup htop((ϕ, ψ), u, Uu)
where the supremum is taken over all families of ﬁnite covers Uu = {U(u′)}u′∈γ (u)
which have a positive Lebesgue number.

(b) The Bowen-Dinaburg-type Deﬁnition
Suppose u ∈M is arbitrary. On the space N(u) we consider for m ∈N the family
of metrics given through
ρu,m(υ, w) :=
max
0≤k≤m−1 ρϕk(u)(ψk(u, υ), ψk(u, w)).
A set P ⊂N(u) we call (m, ε)-spanning if for any υ ∈N(u) there is a point w ∈
P such that ρu,m(υ, w) < ε. A set R ⊂N(u) is said to be (m, ε)-separated if
for any υ, w ∈R, υ ̸= w, we have ρu,m(υ, w) > ε. Suppose Nε(N(u), m) is the
smallest cardinality of an (m, ε)-spanning set in N(u) and Sε(N(u), m) is the largest
cardinality of an (m, ε)-separated set in N(u). Repeating the proof of Lemma 3.5,
Chap.3, for the ﬁbre N(u) we get the following result which is an analogon of
Proposition 3.26, Chap.3.
Proposition 9.2 Suppose {(N(u), ρu)}u∈M is a family of compact metric spaces
and ψk(u, ·) : N(u) →N(ϕk(u)), u ∈M, k ∈Z is a family of continuous maps.
Then for any u ∈M we have
htop((ψ, ϕ), u) = lim
ε→0+ lim sup
m→∞

m log Nε(N(u), m)
= lim
ε→0+ lim sup
m→∞

m log Sε(N(u), m) .
(c) Upper Estimates for the Topological Entropy
Let us derive an analogon of Ito’s entropy estimate (Theorem 5.28, Chap.5) for
ﬁbered cocycle systems.
We say that the cocycle (ϕ, ψ) satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition along the orbit γ (u) of
ϕ if there exist positive numbers λk = λk(u), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , such that the following
inequalities are satisﬁed
ρϕk+1(u)

≤λkρϕk(u)(υ, w),
∀υ, w ∈N(ϕk(u)),
k = 0, 1, . . . .
Theorem 9.12 Suppose u ∈M is arbitrary, dimF(N(u)) < +∞and the cocycle
(ϕ, ψ) satisﬁes along the orbit γ (u) of ϕ a Lipschitz condition with constants λk =
λk(u), k = 0, 1, . . . . Suppose that λ := lim sup

Then htop((ϕ, ψ), u) ≤λ dimF(N(u)),

is satisﬁed for all δ > 0 sufﬁciently small. Recall that the number Nε(N(u), m)
characterizes in the metric ρu,m the minimal number of balls with radius ε > 0
necessary for covering of N(u). From this it follows that
ρN(ϕk(u))(ψk(u, υ), ψk(u, w)) ≤λk−1 · . . . · λ0ρN(u)(υ, w),
∀υ, w ∈N(u).
Suppose that m is a positive integer and λ′

max{λk, 1} + 2−m. It follows that
for all sufﬁciently small ε > 0 we have Bδ ⊂Bε(u, m), where Bδ and Bε(u, m) are
balls in spaces with metric ρp and ρm,ρ, respectively, and δ =
ε
λ′m . From this we get
the inequality
log Nε(u, m)
m
≤log Nδ(N(u))

Using the smallness of ε > 0 (and δ) we get the inequality log Nδ(N(u))

consequently, log Nε(N(u),m)

Now, taking the limit for ε →0+ and using the fact that ζ is arbitrarily close to
dimF Nu, we get that

Dimension Estimates for Dynamical
Systems with Some Degree of
Non-injectivity and Nonsmoothness
Abstract In this chapter dimension estimates for maps and dynamical systems with
speciﬁc properties are derived. In Sect.10.1 a class of non-injective smooth maps
is considered. Dimension estimates for piecewise non-injective maps are given in
Sect.10.2. For piecewise smooth maps with a special singularity set upper Hausdorff
dimension estimates are shown in Sect.10.3. Lower dimension estimates are shown
in Sect.10.4.
10.1
Dimension Estimates for Non-injective Smooth Maps
10.1.1
Hausdorff Dimension Estimates
In Chap. 5 Hausdorff dimension estimates for compact sets K ⊂Rn that are invariant
under C1-maps ϕ are given. The main idea consists in showing that for a number
j ∈N the Hausdorff outer measure of ϕ j(K) is by a certain factor smaller than the
outer measure of K, i.e. the iterated map is contracting with respect to the Hausdorff
outer measure on K. The contraction constant can be estimated by means of a singular
value function of the tangent map, i.e. if the singular value function is less than 1, then
the map is contracting. In Chap. 5 the condition for the contraction of the Hausdorff
outer measure in Rn is weakened using Lyapunov-type functions. The latter results
are generalized in Chap. 8 to maps on Riemannian manifolds (see also [17]). Using
a technique similar to that of Douady and Oesterlé, Temam gave in [38] (see also
[39]) upper bounds for the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of semiﬂow invariant
sets in a Hilbert space. Analogously fractal dimension estimates are derived in [13]
for semiﬂows on Riemannian manifolds.
In practice the maps and vector ﬁelds describing concrete physical or techni-
cal systems are often non-injective (see for instance [4]). For such non-injective
maps it may be possible to use information about the “degree of non-injectivity”
in order to get Hausdorff and fractal outer measure and dimension estimates under
weakened conditions compared with the theorems mentioned above. For the ﬁrst

time such Douady-Oesterlé-type Hausdorff dimension estimates using the “degree
of non-injectivity” are considered in [25]. There a class of k-1-endomorphisms is
described, where the given invariant set can be split into k compact subsets and
where each of those subsets is mapped onto the whole invariant set. The factor 1
k can
be used to compensate the missing contraction property for the Hausdorff outer mea-
sure. Note that another class of modiﬁed systems is given by multivalued differential
and difference equations [34].
In the present section we consider a class of maps satisfying even a weaker non-
injectivity condition than the k-1-property. In general, such a class may be described
as follows. Let ϕ be a C1-map on a smooth (for simplicity C∞) n-dimensional
Riemannian manifold (M, g) and K ⊂M a compact set. (A class of maps that
are only piecewise C1 is considered in [33]. For these maps many results of this
section are also true.) Suppose that for a given outer measure m(·, d) on M (d-
dimensional Hausdorff or fractal outer measure of the given set or of a covering
class of this set) there exist a number 0 < a < 1 and a family {K j} j≥j0 of sub-
sets of K such that m(ϕ j(K j), d) = m(ϕ j(K), d) and m(K j, d) ≤a jm(K, d) for
all j ≥j0. A map ϕ with such properties can be considered as piecewise m(·, d)-
expansive on K ( 1
a is the expansion parameter and also describes the “degree of non-
injectivity”). It follows that for such a map and any set A ⊂K there exists a j ≥j0
such that m(K j, d) ≤a jm(K, d) ≤m(A, d) and m(ϕ j(K j), d) = m(ϕ j(K), d), i.e.
the semidynamical system {ϕ j} j≥0 generated by a piecewise m(·, d)-expansive map
has a certain transitive Markov-type property on K. It will be shown that for neg-
atively invariant sets K of piecewise m(·, d)-expansive maps, where m(·, d) is the
d-dimensional Hausdorff (μH(·, d)) or fractal outer measure, the parameter d is an
upper bound of the associated dimension. Our presentation in Sect.10.1 is based on
the results of [5].
Theorem 10.1 Let (M, g) be a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, U ⊂
M be an open set and ϕ : U →M be a C1-map. Suppose K and 
K are compact sets
satisfying the relations K ⊂
K ⊂U and ϕ j(K) ⊂
K for any j = 1, 2, . . .. Suppose
that for some numbers d ∈(0, n] and a > 0 the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(3) μH(K, d) < ∞.
Then lim

Proof It follows from Chap. 7 that the singular value function satisﬁes the relation

Corollary 10.1 If the conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 10.1 are satisﬁed for cer-
tain numbers a > 0 and d ∈(0, n] and furthermore ϕ(K) ⊃K holds, then either
μH(K, d) = 0, or μH(K, d) = ∞.

Proof It follows from condition (10.1) that there is a number 0 < κ < 1 with
a κ(ϕ(u))
κ(u) ωd(duϕ) < κ for any u ∈
K. Therefore by the chain rule and by applying
(10.1) we get for any u ∈

Example 10.1 Consider the modiﬁed horseshoe map ϕ introduced in Example 1.6,
Chap.1. Let us choose K1 := K ∩[0, 1] × [0, 51
65] and K j := K j−1 ∩ϕ−1(K j−1),
j = 2, 3, . . .. Then these sets satisfy ϕ j(K j) = K = ϕ j(K), so the ﬁrst part of con-
dition (2) of Theorem 10.1 is true. Furthermore the set K j is contained in 4 j rectangles
with edges 1
3 j out of the 6 j rectangles forming K j (see Fig.10.1). Let ε j denote half
of the minimal distance between two of the different 6 j rectangles. If we cover K
by balls of radii smaller than ε j, then every ball can contain points of only one of
the 6 j rectangles. If we consider only the part of K j−1 which is contained in one
of the 6 j−1 rectangles of K j−1, then the part of K j which is contained in the same
rectangle consists of four linear copies of the part of K j−1 with a factor 1
3. Therefore
for ε < ε j we have
μH(K j, d, ε) = 4
3d μH(K j−1, d, 3ε)
for any d ∈[0, 2], in the limit ε →0 + 0 we get
μH(K j, d) =
 4
3d
 j
μH(K, d).
So the second part of condition (2) is satisﬁed with a =
4
3d . Now we have to
check condition (1), i.e. we have to ﬁnd a number d ∈[1, 2] such that ωd,K(ϕ)a < 1
is satisﬁed. The singular value function here has the form
ωd(duϕ) =

≈1.863. For such numbers d the conditions (1)
and (2) of Theorem 10.1 are satisﬁed, and Corollary 10.1 yields to μH(K, d) = 0 or
μH(K, d) = ∞.
Now we want to use the same method as above to ﬁnd an upper estimate of the
Hausdorff dimension of the set K considered in Theorem 10.1. Let us additionally
assume that K is negatively invariant under ϕ, i. e. K ⊂ϕ(K) as in Corollary 10.1.

10.1 Dimension Estimates for Non-injective Smooth Maps
461
Fig. 10.1 Construction of
the invariant set K
In order to ﬁnd an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of K we can not
assume μH(K, d) < ∞as in Theorem 10.1. However it is possible to consider the
Hausdorff outer measure of the class of ﬁnite covers of K by balls of radii at most
ε instead of the Hausdorff outer measure of K itself, because the outer measure of a
ﬁnite cover is always ﬁnite.
Theorem 10.2 Let (M, g) be a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, U ⊂
M be an open set and ϕ : U →M be a C1-map. Suppose K and 
K are compact sets
satisfying the relation K ⊂ϕ j(K) ⊂
K ⊂U for any j = 1, 2, . . .. Suppose that for
some numbers a > 0 and d ∈(0, n] of the form d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, . . . , n −1}
and s ∈(0, 1] the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(1) ωd,
K(ϕ) < 1

(2) There are numbers l with ωd,
K(ϕ) < l < 1
a and j0 ∈N such that for any natural
number j > j0 there exist a set K j ⊂K and a number ε j > 0 such that

Then dimH K ≤d.
Proof Like in the proof of Theorem 10.1 we have ωd,K(ϕ j) ≤ω j
d,
K(ϕ) < l j for any
j ∈N. For any δ > 0 we ﬁnd an integer number jδ > j0 so that the relation 2d0(d0 +

2 (al) j < δ will be true for any j > jδ. Now let j > jδ be ﬁxed and consider
0 < ε ≤min{ε j, (d0 + 1)−1
2 l−j
d ε0(l j)}, where ε0 is deﬁned in Lemma 8.2, Chap.8.
Then condition (2) and Lemma 8.2, Chap.8 result in the following inequalities:
μH(K, d, ε) ≤μH(ϕ j(K), d, ε) = μH(ϕ j(K j), d, ε)
≤2d0(d0 + 1)

d
2 (al) jμH(K, d, ε) ≤δμH(K, d, ε).
Since the number δ can be chosen arbitrarily small and μH(K, d, ε) is ﬁnite, this
means μH(K, d, ε) = 0 for any ε ∈

0, min{ε j, (d0 + 1)−1
2 l−j
d ε0(l j)}
	
and there-
fore, μH(K, d) = 0. Hence we get dimH K ≤d.
□
Using now a Lyapunov-type function we get a corollary of this theorem analogous
to Corollary 10.2.
Corollary 10.3 Let (M, g), U, K, 
K and ϕ be deﬁned as in Theorem 10.2, and let
κ : 
K →R+ be a continuous function, such that for some numbers a > 0 and d ∈

Example 10.2 (Example 10.1 cont’d) For the modiﬁed horseshoe map described
before, in the two-dimensional case the ﬁrst part of condition (2) of Theorem 10.2
is satisﬁed for arbitrary numbers ε > 0 and d ∈[1, 2]. Furthermore, we can show
the existence of a number l with ωd,K(ϕ) < l < 1
a satisfying (d0 + 1)−1
2 l−j
d ≥γ j.
Together with the inequality stated above this yields the second part of condition
(2). Thus we get dimH K ≤d for any number d > ln α−ln 4β2
ln α+ln γ . In the limit this yields
dimH K ≤ln α−ln 4β2
ln α+ln γ . For the parameters α = 1
3, β1 = 3, β2 = 5 we get dimH K ≤
1.863.
If ϕ(K \ K1) ⊂K1 holds then the dimension estimate can be improved by means
of Corollary 10.3. Using an appropriate Lyapunov-type function the condition (1)
of Theorem 10.2 can be replaced by condition (1) of Corollary 10.3. Since here the
singular value function is constant on K1 and K \ K1, respectively, the simplest type
of Lyapunov function is of the same kind, i. e. κ(u) = 1 for u ∈K1 and κ(u) = c > 0
for u ∈K \ K1. Since the distance between the sets K1 and K \ K1 is positive, such
a function is continuous on 
K = K. The constant c has to be chosen in such a way
that supu∈K

κ(u) ωd(duϕ) =

we have to choose c such that 1

type function
κ(u) =

which is less than ωd,K(ϕ) = β2αd−1. For any number d > ln α−ln 4√β1β2
ln α+ln γ
the condi-
tions of Corollary 10.3 are satisﬁed, and we get the improved estimate dimH K ≤
ln α−ln 4√β1β2
ln α+ln γ
. For the parameters α = 1
3, β1 = 3, β2 = 5 this means dimH K ≤1.747
Remark 10.1 In Example 10.2 we would have got the same improved result if we
had changed the standard metric on R2 by multiplying the metric tensor with the
Lyapunov-type function κ.
Since condition (2) of Theorem 10.2 is not easy to check, especially if the map is not
piecewise linear, we now give some stronger conditions which can be checked more
easily.

Fractal Dimension Estimates
The ﬁrst theorem in this subsection provides an upper bound for the fractal dimension
of a negatively invariant set if no information about the “degree of non-injectivity”
is known.
Theorem 10.3 Let (M, g) be a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, U ⊂
M be an open set and ϕ : U →M be a C1-map. Suppose K ⊂U is a compact set
satisfying the relation K ⊂ϕ(K) ⊂U. Assume that
0 < αK(ϕ) := min
u∈K αn(duϕ) < n−1

(10.2)
and there exists a number d ∈(0, n] such that
ωn,K(ϕ)αd−n
K
(ϕ) ≤8−nn−d
2 .
(10.3)
Then dimF K ≤d.
Proof Let η ∈(0, αK(ϕ)) be an arbitrary number and r1 > 0 be so small that there
exists an open set V ⊂M containing K which itself lies inside a compact subset of
U such that
|τ ϕ(u)
ϕ(υ)dυϕτ υ
u −duϕ| ≤η
(10.4)
for any u, υ ∈V with ρ(u, υ) ≤r1 is satisﬁed, where | · | here denotes the operator
norm. By ρ(·, ·) we mean the geodesic distance between the points of M and by
τ υ
u we denote the isometry between the tangent spaces TuM and TυM deﬁned by
parallel transport.
Let expu : TuM →M denote the exponential map at an arbitrary point u ∈M.
Since expu is a smooth map satisfying |dOu expu | = 1 for any point u ∈M we ﬁnd
a number ru > 0 such that |dυ expu | ≤2 for any υ ∈Bru(Ou), where Ou denotes
the origin of the tangent space TuM. Since V is contained in a compact set there
is a number r2 > 0 such that |dυ expu | ≤2 is satisﬁed for any u ∈V and any υ ∈
Br2(Ou). Furthermore there is a number α′ > 0 such that α1(duϕ) < α′ is satisﬁed
for any u ∈V.
Now we can ﬁnd a number r0 ≤min{r1,
r2
2+α′+η} such that any ball Br0(u) con-
taining points of K is entirely contained in V. Let r ∈(0,r0) be ﬁxed. Since K
is compact there is a ﬁnite number of points u j ∈V, j = 1, . . . , Nr(K), such that
K = Nr(K)

ϕ(K) =

Remark 10.3 For two-dimensional horseshoe maps the upper bound for the frac-
tal dimension of an invariant set obtained by Corollary 10.7 is always smaller than
the bound for the Hausdorff dimension by Theorem 10.2, because for d < 2 condi-
tion (10.12) is weaker than condition (1) of this theorem. For d > 2 this relation is
reversed, i.e. for the considered horseshoe maps in more than two dimensions the
estimates of Subsect. 10.1.2 really will be useful.
10.2
Dimension Estimates for Piecewise C1-Maps
10.2.1
Decomposition of Invariant Sets of Piecewise Smooth
Maps
One possibility to handle dimension estimates for non-differentiable maps on an
n-dimensional manifold is to suppose that the set of non-differentiable points is a
ﬁnite union of submanifolds having topological dimension less than the dimension
of the manifold and to consider only orbits being without contact to the set of non-
differentiability (see [2]). In contrast to this in the present subsection we consider a
class of piecewise smooth maps whose preimage sets of non-differentiability points
for various iterates are bounded. The maps under consideration are supposed to be
differentiable on the elements of a partition of the given set such that the preimages
of these elements under the iterated map are controllable in a certain sense. For some
large classes of maps, our Hausdorff dimension bounds agree with the dimension of
their invariant sets prevalently.
In concrete physical or technical systems the considered maps are often not only
non-smooth but besides this even non-injective, i.e. they show a “many to one”
behavior (see for instance [4, 5, 11]). For uniformly non-injective maps it is possible
asitwasshowninSect.10.1toincludeintothedimensionestimatessomeinformation
about the “degree of non-injectivity”. We apply the approach of [5], presented in
Sect.10.1, to our class of piecewise C1-smooth maps.
In general, the singular value function computed for the differential of the basic
map does not satisfy the contraction condition on all parts of the invariant set. Nev-
ertheless in such a situation it may be possible to get a contraction for the outer
Hausdorff measure if higher iterates of the given map are considered. For this pur-

472

pose we divide the phase space into “good” and “bad” parts in order to compensate
the growth of the outer measure under one iteration in bad parts by the decrease of
such a measure in good parts of the phase space. By investigating the asymptotic
behavior of the system we have to guarantee that any orbit stays sufﬁciently long in
good parts and not too long in bad parts of the phase space.
The section is organized as follows. The deﬁnition of the considered class of
piecewise smooth maps is given in Subsect. 10.2.2. Subsection10.2.3 is concerned
with the proof of the Douady-Oesterlé formula from [33] for piecewise smooth
maps. The degree of non-injectivity is introduced in the Douady-Oesterlé estimate
in Subsect. 10.2.4. In Subsect. 10.2.5, which is based on [36], some information on
the statistical long time behavior of the orbits is considered in the Douady-Oesterlé
formula.
10.2.2
A Class of Piecewise C1-Maps
Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional smooth C∞-Riemannian manifold and let ρ(·, ·)
denote the geodesic distance between two arbitrary points of M.
We now characterize a class of piecewise C1-smooth maps ϕ : U ⊂M →M, for
which the Douady-Oesterlé estimate will be proved. Roughly speaking, these maps
possess the property that the non-differentiability set in U have controllable preimage
sets. It will be shown that some well-known classes of piecewise differentiable maps
have this property.
Formally the deﬁnition is as follows. We say that a map ϕ : U ⊂M →M satis-
ﬁes the hypothesis (H) if there exists a ﬁnite or inﬁnite index set I ⊂{1, 2, . . .} and
a partition U = 
i∈I Ui of subsets Ui ⊂U having Ui ∩U j = ∅for i ̸= j such that
the following conditions (H0)–(H2) hold:
(H0) The restriction ϕ|int Ui is C1 for every i ∈I.
(H1) For any m ∈N the set U can be decomposed into connected subsets U(m)
i
,
i.e. int U(m)
i
̸= ∅is connected and U(m)
i
⊂int U(m)
i
, so that the map ϕm is C1 on the
set int U(m)
i
and ϕm can be extended to a C1-map on any U(m)
i
.
(H2) There is a natural numberk with the property that for arbitrary m ∈N there
exists a real numberε(m) > 0 such that for any ε ∈(0,ε(m)] and any u ∈M with
dist(u, U) ≤ε(m) the ball B(u, ε) can be decomposed into at most k connected
subsets U(m)
i
∩B(u, ε).
The following two examples show that certain well-known classes of maps satisfy
the condition (H).
Example 10.5 (Baker’s map) Consider the square U = (0, 1] × [0, 1] ⊂R2 and the
map ϕ : U →U deﬁned by
ϕ(x, y) =
 (2x, λy),

andε(m) = 1
2(maxi=1,...,r li)−m for every m ∈N.
Since the maps from these examples are not everywhere differentiable the known
methods from [5, 9, 20, 29, 38], presented in Chaps.5 and 7, can not directly be
applied to get dimension estimates of the invariant sets. We will come back to these
examples later in Subsect. 10.2.3.
We present now an example which illustrates that (H0) and (H1) may be true
although (H2) is not satisﬁed.
Example 10.7 (Belykh map) Consider the map ϕ : R2 →R2 given by
ϕ(θ, η) = (θ + δ1η −δ1δ2 (F(θ) −δ3), η (1 −δ4δ1) −δ1δ5 (F(θ) −δ3)).
(10.13)
We suppose that in (10.13) the parameters δ2, δ5, δ4 are non-negative, δ1 is positive
and δ3 is a real. Suppose that F : R →R is a 2π-periodic function. Note that the
map (10.13) describes certain discrete systems of phase synchronization [4].
We now assume that δ5 > 0 and F is of the special type F(θ)=1 −θ
π (θ mod 2π).
In this case the given map (10.13) can be transformed by x =
1
2π (θ −(1 −δ3) π −
δ1η
a ), y =
1
2π (θ −(1 −δ3)π + δ1η

c = 1−δ3

Note that μ −λ = a + b > 0 and, under the condition ( δ1δ2
π + 1) (1 −δ4δ1) −
δ2
1s
π ̸= 0, also λμ ̸= 0.
The map (10.14) can be considered on the two-dimensional torus T 2, deﬁned by
the equivalence relation
(x, y) ∼(x′, y′) ⇐⇒x′ = x + k + l
λ, y′ = y + k + l
μ,
(k,l ∈Z).
Denote by π : R2 →T 2 the canonical projection. Then the discontinuity set
{k2π, k ∈Z} of F transforms into the discontinuity set π(G) of ϕ on T 2, where
G :=

(x, y) ∈R2 : y = −c(a + b) −ax
b

.
In the following we suppose that the torus is represented as T 2 = π(Q), where
Q :=

(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤ax + by
a + b
+ c < 1, 0 ≤aλx + bμy
a + b
+ c < 1

.
Using this representation the discontinuity set of ϕm can be written as union of
line segments
π

(x, y) ∈Q : ∃j ∈{1, . . . , m} with aλ j−1x + bμ j−1y
a + b
+ c ∈Z
	
.
It follows that the sets U(m)
i
which have to be considered in condition (H1) posses
bounderies consisting of discontinuity points of ϕm. Since ϕm here is linear, the
C1-extension of this function is possible. Thus, for the considered map (10.14) the
conditions (H0) and (H1) are satisﬁed. In order to verify (H2) we distinguish two
cases in parameter space.
Case 1 c = 0 and λ < −μ < 0 or μ > λ > 0.
Obviously, π((0, 0)) ∈T 2 is a ﬁxed point of ϕ. The family of discontinuity line
segments for ϕm through π((0, 0)) is given by the projection of these segments in Q
aλ j−1x + bμ j−1y
a + b
+ c = 0,
i.e.,
y = −a
b
 λ
μ
	 j−1
x.
For sufﬁciently small x > 0 the projection of these points lies in T 2.
For μ = 2, λ = 1, a = 2
3, b = 1
3 and j = 1, 2, 3, 4 these discontinuity sets are
shown in Fig.10.2a).
As a consequence the number of preimage sets U(m)
i
near π((0, 0)) which we have
to consider in (H1) is proportional to m and so it is impossible to ﬁnd a number k
such that (H2) is satisﬁed.

a) Discontinuity set for Case 1
b) Discontinuity set for Case 2
Fig. 10.2 Non-differentiability sets for the Belykh map
Case 2 c ∈R arbitrary and μ = −λ(= a+b
2
> 0). The discontinuity sets of ϕm
are given by the projections of the line segments in Q written as
∃k j ∈Z : aλ j−1x + bμ j−1y
a + b
+ c = k j,
i.e.,
y = (−1) j a
b x + 2 j−1(k j −c)
b(a + b) j−2 .
It follows that all these segments are parallel to the line segments y = a
b x resp.
y = −a
b x in Q. Thus, for any m ∈N there exist only ﬁnitely many such parallels
and, consequently, they may have only ﬁnitely many (transversal) intersections. All
these intersection points have a positive distance to neighboring parallels. Thus, in
order to satisfy (H2) it is sufﬁcient to take k = 4 and to require that for any m ∈N
the number ε (m) is so small that 2ε (m) is not greater than the minimum of the
considered distances. For μ = 1, λ = −1, a = b = c = 1 and various j Case 2 is
illustrated in Fig.10.2b).
Suppose now that (M, g) is an n-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold and
U ⊂M is a subset. For a map ϕ : U →M satisfying (H), a number d ∈[0, n]
and an arbitrary u ∈U we denote by duϕ : TuM →Tϕ(u)M the tangent map of the
C1-extension of ϕ and deﬁne for any bounded set K ⊂U the function
ωd,K(ϕ) := sup
u∈K
ωd(duϕ).
We formulate the following lemma which will be used in the next subsection and
which can be proved similarly as the corresponding theorems in Chaps.5 and 8.

Lemma 10.1 Let ϕ : U ⊂M →M be a map satisfying (H). Furthermore, let K ⊂
U be a bounded and ϕ-invariant set (i.e. ϕ(K) = K) and d ∈[0, n] an arbitrary
number. Then the following two statements are true:
(a) ωd(duϕ2) ≤ωd(dϕ(u)ϕ) · ωd(duϕ) for all u ∈K.

for the class of piecewise smooth maps satisfying (H).
Theorem 10.5 Suppose that ϕ : U ⊂M →M satisﬁes (H). Let K ⊂U be a
bounded and ϕ-invariant set (i.e. ϕ(K) = K) and suppose that for some number
d ∈(0, n] the inequality ωd,K(ϕ) < 1 is satisﬁed. Then dimH K ≤d.
Corollary 10.8 Suppose that ϕ : U ⊂M →M satisﬁes (H). Let K ⊂U be
bounded and ϕ-invariant and suppose that there exists a number d ∈(0, n) with
ωd,K(ϕ) = 1 and ωd,K(ϕ) < 1 for all d ∈(d, n]. Then dimH K ≤d.
Proof By Theorem 10.5 we have dimH K ≤d for all d > d. For d →d + 0 we get
dimH K ≤d.

Corollary 10.9 Suppose that ϕ : U ⊂M →M satisﬁes (H). Let K ⊂U be a com-
pact and ϕ-invariant set and suppose that for a certain number d ∈(0, n] and some
continuous function κ : K →R+ = {x ∈R : x > 0} the condition
sup

ωd(duϕ)

is satisﬁed. Then dimH K ≤d.
Proof The proof is based on a technique considering κ as Lyapunov-type function
as it is done in Chaps.5 and 8. We set κ := supu∈K

κ(ϕ(u))
κ(u) ωd(duϕ)
	
. By assumption
the value κ is less than one. Using the chain rule and applying Lemma 10.1 we have
ωd(duϕ j) ≤ωd(dϕ j−1(u)ϕ) · . . . · ωd(duϕ) ≤κ κ(ϕ j−1(u))

supu∈K ωd(duϕ j) < 1 holds. Now we can apply Theorem 10.5 to the map ϕ j and we
obtain dimH K ≤d.

10.2 Dimension Estimates for Piecewise C1-Maps
477
Before proving Theorem 10.5 we formulate a technical lemma, which generalizes
a result in Chap. 8 for the case of bounded sets and piecewise C1-maps on manifolds.
Lemma 10.2 Suppose that ϕ : U ⊂M →M satisﬁes (H), d ∈(0, n] is a number
written as d = d0 + s with d0 ∈{0, 1, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1], C and λ are con-
stants deﬁned by C = 2d0(d0 + 1)d/2 and λ = 2√d0 + 1. Suppose that for a bounded
and ϕ-invariant set K ⊂U and a natural number m the inequality ωd,K(ϕm) ≤k
is satisﬁed. Then for every l > k there exists a number ε0 > 0 such that for all
ε ∈(0, ε0] and the constant k from (H) the inequality
μH(ϕm(K), d, λl1/dε) ≤k ClμH(K, d, ε)
(10.15)
holds.
Proof Let ε(m) be the number from hypothesis (H) and take ε1 <ε(m) such that
for the set V := U ∩
u∈K B(u, ε1) the relation k′ := supu∈V ωd(duϕm) < l holds.
We choose numbers δ > 0 and η > 0 such that k′ < δd, supu∈V |duϕm| ≤δ and the
equality

ϕm(υ)dυϕmτ υ
u −duϕm ≤η
is satisﬁed for all u, υ ∈V with ρ(u, υ) ≤2ε0. Here τ is the isometric map (see
Appendix A).
For a ﬁxed number ε ≤ε0 we consider a ﬁnite cover of K with balls {B(u j,r j)}
of radiusr j ≤ε, where each ball contains at least one point from K.
Let j be ﬁxed. Consider the decomposition
B(u j, 

i=1,...,q j

for a certain s
such that the right-hand side is connected, and such that ϕm is on any such set
extentiable to a C1-map. Taylor’s formula is now applied to the differentiable map
ϕm along a continuous curve, which connects the points u and υ j,i in Bi(υ j,i,r j) due
to (H1) and yields


dυ j,i ϕm(B(Oυ j,i,r j)) + B(Oϕm(υ j,i), ηr j)
	
for any part Bi(υ j,i,r j).
Using hypothesis (H2) and following the method in Chap.8 we get ﬁnally the
inequality (10.15).
□
Proof of Theorem 10.5 From ωd,K(ϕ) < 1 and the statement (b) of Lemma 10.1 it
follows that ωd,K(ϕm) becomes arbitrary small for sufﬁciently large m. Therefore,
the number l from Lemma 10.2 can be made so small that the inequalities λl
1
d < 1
and kCl < 1 are satisﬁed, where λ and C are deﬁned as in Lemma 10.2. Using
K = ϕ(K) = . . . = ϕm(K),μH(K, d, ε) < +∞andLemma10.2weobtaintogether
with (10.15)
μH(K, d, ε) ≤μH(K, d, λl

d ε) = μH(ϕm(K), d, λl
1
d ε) ≤kClμH(K, d, ε)
for all ε ∈(0, ε0]. Because of kCl < 1 as a consequence we get μH(K, d, ε) = 0
for all ε ∈(0, ε0]. This implies μH(K, d) = 0, and therefore we get dimH K ≤d.□
Now we apply the results of Theorem 10.5 to some examples. In all these cases
the Hausdorff dimension estimates of the considered invariant sets, given on the basis
of Corollary 10.5, are sharp.
Example 10.8 (Example 10.5 cont’d)
We consider again the baker’s map
ϕ
described in Example 10.5. An invariant set K of ϕ is given by K = ∞
j=1 ϕ j(U).
The singular values of the linearization d(x,y)ϕ are α1 = 2 and α2 = λ independently
of (x, y) ∈K. Therefore, we have ω1+s,K(ϕ) < 1 for all s ∈

−ln 2
ln λ, 1

. With Corol-
lary 10.8 we get the estimate dimH K ≤1 −ln 2
ln λ. This is a sharp estimation because
of the well-known fact that dimH K = 1 −ln 2
ln λ (see for example [10]).
Example 10.9 (Example 10.6 cont’d) For the map ϕ deﬁned in Example 10.6 a
ϕ-invariant set is, as in Example 10.8, given by K = ∞
k=1 ϕk(U).
Suppose that the numbers ∈(0, 1] is determined by the condition r
i=1 rs
i = 1,
and furthermore li = r−s
i
for i = 1, . . . ,r is satisﬁed. For all i = 1, 2, . . . ,r and
s > s we have ω1+s,K∩Ui (ϕ) = lirs
i < lirs
i = 1. It follows that ω1+s,K(ϕ) < 1, and
by Corollary 10.8 we get dimH K ≤1 +s.
Note that our invariant set may be represented in the form K = A × B, where
A = (0, 1] and B is a modiﬁed Cantor set. Since A and B are Borel sets we have
by Proposition 3.25, Chap.3 that dimH A + dimH B ≤dimH(A × B). We pay our
attention to the Hausdorff dimension of the set B. With the estimate above and
dimH A = 1 we obtain dimH B ≤s. Resulting from [14] or [10] (Theorem9.3) we
have dimH B = s. So our estimate is sharp.
For the special case r = 2, l1 = l2 = 2, r1 = r2 = 1
3, a1 = 0 and a2 = 2
3 we see
that B is the standard Cantor set. Our estimate gives dimH B ≤s = ln 2
ln 3 which coin-
cides with the well-known value dimH B = ln 2
ln 3.

Analogously to Example 10.9 an invariant set K of this map can be represented as
K = A × B, in the given situation with A = (0, 1] and B the well-known Sierpi´nski
gasket (see [10], Example9.4). It can be shown that Corollary 10.8 gives the estimate
dimH B ≤ln 3
ln 2. As to be seen in [10] this estimation is also sharp.
Remark 10.4 As it was noted above the Belykh map from Example10.7 does not
satisfy the condition (H) in general and thus a direct application of Theorem 10.5 for
many parameters is not possible. For μ = |λ| = a+b
2
< 1, however, Theorem 10.5
is applicable and for a compact invariant set K we have the inequality ωd,K(ϕ) =
( a+b
2 )d < 1 for d ∈(0, 2]. It follows that dimH K = 0. If in other parameter cases
we extend the function ϕ both on U1 and on U2 to C1-maps ϕ1 and ϕ2, respectively,
then we have to consider at most two C1-maps for any ball, which is an element of
the cover of an invariant set K. On the base in Chap. 8 this gives for 0 < λμ < 1
2
the Hausdorff dimension estimate dimH K ≤ln λ−ln μ
ln λ+ln 2 . A different approach to the
dimension investigation of the Belykh family is given in Sect.10.2 (see also [35]).
10.2.4
Consideration of the Degree of Non-injectivity
In order to use the Douady-Oesterlé-type conditions of the previous subsection for
dimension estimates it is necessary that the contraction condition of the singular
value function ωd,K(ϕ) < 1 is satisﬁed. This may result in strong restrictions for the
parameters as it happens for instance in Example 10.8, where λ ∈(0, 1
2) is required.
The question raises how we can get a dimension estimate for the parameters λ > 1
2,
i. e. for the case ωd,K(ϕ) > 1.
It turns out that in certain cases, where the contraction condition of the singular
value function is not fulﬁlled the exploration of an additional non-injectivity condi-
tion allows to get a contraction for the outer Hausdorff measures. Using the approach

480
10

of Sect.10.1 we investigate piecewise C1-maps on n-dimensional smooth manifolds
having the following property. Suppose that for the given d-dimensional Hausdorff
outer measure μH(·, d, ε) at level ε there exists a number 0 < a < 1 and a family
{K j} j≥j0 of subsets of the ϕ-invariant set K such that for all j ≥j0 this outer mea-
sure of K j is at most a j times the outer measure of K and the outer measures of the
sets ϕ j(K j) and ϕ j(K) are equal. A map with such a property can be considered as
piecewise expansive with respect to the Hausdorff measure on K and the factor a−1
is the expansion parameter which describes the “degree of non-injectivity”.
The next two theorems are borrowed from [36].
Theorem 10.6 Let (M, g) be a smooth n-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Sup-
pose that ϕ : U ⊂M →M satisﬁes (H). Let K ⊂U be a bounded and ϕ-invariant
set. Suppose that for some numbers a > 0 and d ∈(0, n] of the form d = d0 + s
with d0 ∈{0, . . . , n −1} and s ∈(0, 1] the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) ωd,K(ϕ) < 1
a ;
(b) There are numbers l with ωd,K(ϕ) < l < 1
a and m0 ∈N such that for every
natural number m > m0 there exist a set Km ⊂K and a number εm > 0 such
that
μH(ϕm(Km), d, ε) = μH(ϕm(K), d, ε),
μH(Km, d, 2−1(d0 + 1)−1
2 l−m
d ε) ≤amμH(K, d, ε)
hold for all ε ∈(0, εm].
Then dimH K ≤d.
Proof The proof uses methods of Sect.10.1 and Lemma 10.2. By Lemma 10.1 we
have ωd,K(ϕm) ≤ωm
d,K(ϕ) < lm for all m ∈N. Thus, for every δ > 0 we ﬁnd an
integer mδ > m0 such that k2d0(d0 + 1)
d
2 (al)m < δ will be true for all m > mδ. Let
m > mδ be ﬁxed. Using the invariance of the set K and condition (b) we obtain
μH(K, d, ε) = μH(ϕm(K), d, ε) = μH(ϕm(Km), d, ε)
(10.16)
for all ε ∈(0, εm]. By applying the method of the proof of Lemma 10.2 we can show
that there exists a number ε0 > 0 such that
μH(ϕm(Km), d, ε) ≤k 2d0(d0 + 1)

where the number δ > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small. Since μH(K, d, ε) is ﬁnite
we conclude that μH(K, d, ε) = 0 holds for all ε ∈

Example 10.11 Consider the set U = [0, 1] × [−1, 1) ⊂R2 and the map ϕ :

choose ε(m) =

m+1 for m ∈N and k = 2. It is easy to see that U ⊃ϕ(U) ⊃
. . . ⊃ϕm(U) holds for every m ∈N, so we can deﬁne a ϕ-invariant bounded set
K = ∞
m=1 ϕm(U) = [0, 1] × {0}. The singular values of duϕm are α1(duϕm) = 2m
and α2(duϕm) = λm.

× {0} and Km := Km−1 ∩ϕ−1(Km−1) (m = 2,
3, . . .). For arbitrary m ∈N we have ϕm(Km) = K = ϕm(K). Thus, for all ε > 0
and d ∈(1, 2] the relation μH(ϕm(Km), d, ε) = μH(ϕm(K), d, ε) holds. If the set
K is covered by balls of radii smaller than 1 then the set Km can be covered by linear
copies of sets of the covering for Km−1 scaled by the factor 1
2. Thus, we get
μH(Km, d, ε) ≤1
2d μH(Km−1, d, 2ε)
for arbitrary m ∈N, d ∈(1, 2] and ε < 1. For εm < 1 it follows that μH(Km, d,
2−mε) ≤2−dmμH(K, d, ε) holds for all ε ∈(0, εm]. For a = 2−d and l = 2 we have
ωd,K(ϕ) = 2λd−1 < l < 1
a . Further, there holds 2−1−1
2 l−m
d ≥2−m for sufﬁciently
large m ∈N. Because of the property of the outer measure we conclude that

d ε) ≤amμH(K, d, ε)
for all ε ∈(0, εm] and m ≥m0 ≥3

d−1. So, all conditions of Theorem 10.6 are
satisﬁed and we obtain dimH K ≤d for arbitrary d ∈(1, 2]. Applying Corollary
10.8 this yields dimH K ≤1, which is a sharp estimate.

Introduction of Long Time Behavior Information
In this subsection we investigate maps ϕ for which the singular value function of
the tangent map satisﬁes a contraction condition on a subset of the ϕ-invariant set K
only. Using some information about the long time behavior of the system we derive
dimension estimates.

Estimation of the Hausdorff Dimension for Invariant
Sets of Piecewise Smooth Vector Fields
The results of this subsection are due to Noack [28] and Schmidt [36]. Suppose that
on the n-dimensional manifold M of smoothness Cm(m ≥3) there is given a vector
ﬁeld f : M →T M of smoothness Cr(1 ≤r < m). Let us consider the differential
equation
˙u = f (u)
(10.19)
with the global ﬂow ϕ : R × M →M. Denote by Ωk
r (M) the vector space of Cr-
smooth k-forms on M. Suppose that β ∈Ωk
l (M) is an arbitrary Cl-smooth k-form.
The Lie derivative of β with respect to f at a point u ∈M is given by [1]
L f β(u) = d
dt |t=0
(ϕt)∗β(u)
(10.20)
where (ϕt)∗β is the pullback of β. This pullback satisﬁes the variational equation
d
dt (ϕt)∗β = (ϕt)∗L f β
(10.21)
of (10.19) with respect to the k-form β.
Assume now that β ∈Ωk
r (M) and Mk ⊂M is a k-dimensional submanifold of
M. We suppose that there is a normalization Nk, i.e., a smooth map Nk : u ∈Mk →
TuMk ⊕Nu with TuMk ⊕Nu = TuM (see [28]). Then for arbitrary u ∈M and

t ∈R the pullback of β|Mk is a k-form on Mk with
L f β|Mk (u) = divβ, Nk f (u)β|Mk (u).
(10.22)
We call divβ, Nk f (u) divergence of f with respect to β and Nk at the point u.
Suppose now that μ is a volume form on M and μ|Nk is the associated k-form on
Mk. Deﬁne the numbers

(10.23)
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n, where u ∈Mk and the supremum is taken over all normaliza-
tions Nk of Mk.
For an arbitrary d ∈(0, n] written in the form d = k + s with k ∈[0, . . . , n −1]
and s ∈[0, 1] we introduce the function
κd(u) := (1 −s)λ(k)(u) + sλ(k+1)(u)
(10.24)

Remark 10.6 Suppose that μ is the volume form on M generated by the Rieman-
nian metric. Then for arbitrary u ∈M, k ∈{1, . . . , n} and a k-dimensional subman-
ifold Mk ⊂M we have
λ(k)(u) = λ1(u) + · · · + λk(u)
where λ1(u) ≥· · · ≥λn(u) are the eigenvalues of the symmetrized covariant deriva-

2(∇f ∗(u) + ∇f (u)).
Suppose that (M, g) is an n-dimensional Riemannian Cm-manifold (m > 3) and
let fk : M →T M be Cr-smooth (0 < r < m) vector ﬁelds for k ∈I ⊂N. Suppose
also that for any k ∈I there exists the global ﬂow to the differential equation
˙u = fk(u).
(10.26)
Denote this ﬂow to (10.26) by {ϕ(·)
k (·)}. Let us assume that there is a partition of
the manifold into subsets Mi and there are C1 functions Fi : M →R satisfying for
all i ∈I the following conditions:
(E1) The sets Mi are mutually disjoint and connected;
(E2) If u ∈M j then there exists a τ = τ(u) > 0 such that ϕt
j(u) ∈M j for all
t ∈[0, τ];

(E3) For any i ∈I we have Fi(u) = 0 if and only if u ∈∂Mi\Mi.
Let us introduce a sequence of maps ξi : M →M and a sequence of functions
ti : M →R+(i ∈N0) satisfying 0 = t0(u) < t1(u) < . . . for all u ∈M, using the
formulas
ξi(u) = ϕti(u)
mi−1(u)(u),
(10.27)
ti+1(u) = t1(ξi(u))

Let us denote T (u) := {t j(u)| j ∈N0} for arbitrary u ∈M. Deﬁne the vector ﬁeld
f : M →T M by
f|Mi = fi
for all i ∈I.
Then the differential equation
˙u = f (u)
(10.28)
is called piecewise smooth and the points ξi(u) are the switching points of the vector
ﬁeld (10.28) with respect to u ∈M . Let us also introduce the coding functions
mi : M →R which deﬁne for any u ∈M and i ∈N0 the index j ∈N such that
ξi(u) ∈M j.
The solution of (10.28) is given by a map ϕ : R+ × M →M which is deﬁned
by
ϕt(u) = ϕt

(10.29)
One can show that ϕ(·)(·) is a semiﬂow having the property ϕt+s(u) = ϕt(ϕs(u))
for all t, s ∈R+ and u ∈M. Let us now introduce the sets Ω0 = D0 = M and

The next lemmas are generalizations of similar results for piecewise smooth sys-
tems in Rn [12, 36].
Lemma 10.4 Suppose 
i Mi is a partition of M and Fi are C1-functions satisfying
(E1)–(E3). Suppose also that on M there is given a piecewise smooth vector ﬁeld
(10.28). Then for any j ∈N and k ∈I with Mk ∩Q j ̸= ∅the function t j : M →
R+ and the map ξ j : M →M from (10.27) is continuously differentiable on the set
Mk ∩Q j ̸= ∅.
In addition to this for any j ∈N0, u0 ∈Mk ∩Q j+1 and t ∈(t j(u0), t j+1(u0))
there exists a δ = δ(t) > 0 such that for all u ∈B(u0, δ) ∩Mk ∩Q j+1 and ϕt(·) is
continuously differentiable on B(u0, δ) ∩Mk ∩Q j+1.
Proof The proof can be done using the implicit function theorem.
□
It follows from Lemma 10.4 that the map ϕt(·) is piecewise C1 on Q. As a
consequence the differential duϕt has a jump at the transition moments ti(u), i ∈N.
Assume that the jump at time t j(u) can be described by a linear operator Sj(u) which
is deﬁned by the property
lim
t→t j(u)+0 duϕt = Sj(u) ◦

lim
t→t j(u)−0 duϕt	
.
(10.32)
Let us deﬁne for arbitrary j ∈N0 and u ∈Q j the transition operator Sj(u) :
Tξ j(u)M →Tξ j(u)M with initial point u ∈M by
Sj(u)υ =
dξ j(u)Fm j−1(u)υ
L fm j−1(u) Fm j−1(u)(ξ j(u))( fm j(u)(ξ j(u)) −fm j−1(u)(ξ j(u))) + iddξ j (u)M
(10.33)
for all υ ∈Tξ j(u)M. By assumption the dominator in (10.33) is different from zero
for u ∈Q j.
Lemma 10.5 Supposethattherearegivenapiecewisesmoothvectorﬁeld f : M →

(1) The transition operator (10.33) Sj(u) : Tξ j(u)M →Tξ j(u)M has for arbitrary
j ∈N and u ∈Q j the property (10.32).
(2) Deﬁne for all t ∈R+ and u ∈Q the linear operator Y(t, u) : TuM →Tϕt(u)M

Proof The ﬁrst part of the assertion can be shown as in [16] for the linear space.
Let us ﬁx arbitrary j ∈N0\{0} and u ∈Q j. For brevity we put i := m j−1(u) and
k := m j(u). By Eq.10.29 we have for ϕ(·)(·) with arbitrary υ ∈TuM

(10.36)
where dut j : TuM →R and duξ j : TuM →Tξ j(u)M are the differentials of the
function t j and the map ξ j. Since ϕ0
i (p) = p and dξϕ0
i = idTpM for all p ∈M
and l ∈I we have
lim
t→t j+0 duϕtυ = −fk(ξ j)dut jυ + duξ jυ.
(10.37)
By deﬁnition we have ξ j(u) = ϕt j(u)(u) and consequently
duξ jυ = fi(ξ j(u))dut jυ + lim
t→t j−0 duϕtυ.
(10.38)
Let us consider the auxiliary map Ξ t
i, j(u) := ϕ
t−t j−1(u)
i
(ξ j−1(u)) and the auxiliary
function ht
j(u) := Fi(Ξi, j(t, u)) on M. In particular we have Ξ

i, j
(u) = ξ j(u).
Furthermore we receive for arbitrary υ ∈TuM
duht
jυ = dΞ t
i, j(u)Fi(duΞ t
i, jυ)
and since u ∈Q j we have ˙h
t j(u)
j
(u) = L fi Fi(ξ j(u)) ̸= 0. By assumption (E3) we
have the relation h

(u) = 0 for all u ∈Q j. From this by differentiation we get
L fi Fi(Ξ t

i, jυ we receive the assertion (1).
Let us show now that the operator deﬁned in (2) has the form (10.34). Note
that from the deﬁnition it follows immediately that Y(t, u) = duϕt
m0(u) for the
t ∈[0, t1(u)) . Suppose now that j ∈N0\{0} and t ∈(t j−1(u), t j(u)) are arbitrary.
Using the deﬁnition of Y(t, u) and the fact that fk(ϕ(·)(u)) is the solution of the
variational equation Dy
dt = ∇fk(ϕt(u))y, we get with (10.36), (10.38) and (10.40)
for arbitrary υ ∈TuM
Y(t, u)υ = duϕtυ = Yk(t −t j(u), ξ j(u))[−fk(ξ j(u))dut jυ + duξ jυ]
= Yk(t −t j(u), ξ j(u))[ fi(ξ j(u)) −fk(ξ j(u))]dut jυ + lim
t→t j−0 duϕtυ
= Yk(t −t j(u), ξ j(u)) lim
t→t j+0 duϕtυ
where again we have put i = m j−1(u) and k = m j(u).
From this and assertion (1) of the theorem it follows that (10.34) is true. It remains
to show that any curve t →y(t, u) = Y(t, u)y0 with y(0, u) = y0 is a solution of
the variational equation (10.35). Let an arbitrary t ∈(t j(u), t j+1(u)) be ﬁxed. Since
Ym j(u)(·, u) is the normed for t = 0 fundamental operator of the variational equation
Dy
dt = ∇fm j(u)y, we get with the presentation (10.34) in coordinates of a chart x
around ϕt(u) with yi, f i, Y i

Ui,k := {u ∈Mk ∩Q | t ∈(ti(u), ti+1(u))}
(10.42)
and write them for brevity as {U j} including in this family only non zero sets U j,k.
Suppose that the family {U j} has the following properties:

two points u, p ∈ϕ−j+1(Ui j) ∩ϕ−j+2(Ui j) ∩. . . ∩Ui j with ρ(p, u) < ε1 can

tion (10.28) on the partition 

Suppose further that K ⊂Q ⊂M is a compact set which is ϕt invariant for some
t > 0. We set N(t, u) := max{ j ∈N|t j(u) < t}. Assume that the sets Ui, deﬁned in

Proof The ﬁrst steps are similarly to the proof in [36]. Assume that u ∈K is arbitrary.
Let us introduce the abbreviation N := N(t, u), mi := mi(u), ti := ti(u) and ξi :=
ξi(u). From the representation (10.34) of the for t = 0 normed fundamental operator
Y(t, u) : TuM →Tϕt(u)M we get
Y(t, u) = Ym N (t −tN, ξN) ◦SN(u) ◦Ym N−1(tN −tN−1, ξN−1) ◦· · ·
◦Ym1(t2 −t1, ξ1) ◦S1(u) ◦Ym0(t1, u).
(10.44)
Using the generalization of Horn’s lemma (Lemma 2.4, Chap.2) with the abbrevi-
ation Yi := Ymi(ti+1 −ti, ξi) and Si := Si(u) and Y t

that

(10.48)
Now we consider the family of sets Ui. Because of the properties of the semiﬂow
ϕ(·)(·) and Lemma 10.4 the map ϕt(·) is on every set int(Ui) a C1-map and extendable
to a C1-map on Ui. Assumptions (U1) and (U2) and the inequality (10.48) allow us
to applicate Theorem 10.5. This directly gives the estimate dimH K ≤d.

Remark 10.7 Suppose that the assumptions of Theorem 10.8 are satisﬁed. Addi-
tionally it is assumed that the vector ﬁeld f is continuous. Then by Formula (10.33)

Dimension Estimates for Maps with Special
Singularity Sets
In this section, which is based on the results of [27], a Douady-Oesterlé-type estimate
for another class of piecewise smooth dynamical systems is presented than in the
previous section. A special assumption on the Hausdorff measure of the singularity
set and its preimages is needed (see Theorem 10.9). In fact this as assumption is
easy to check for some interesting classes of systems and especially the theorem
is applicable in situation where the results from Sect.10.2 can not be applied. The
general results will be applied to three classes of systems illustrating these facts.
Estimates of the Hausdorff dimension of invariant sets for the Belykh systems, for
the Lozi systems and for a class of piecewise afﬁne solenoid-like systems will be
derived.

Deﬁnitions and Results
Let M be a C∞-Riemannian manifold and U ⊂M. We consider now a special class
of piecewise smooth maps on U.
Deﬁnition 10.1 We say that a map ϕ : U →M fullﬁlls condition (PC) if for all
m ∈N there is a partition {Um
1 , . . . Um
i(m)} of U with connected Borel sets that have
compact closure such that ϕm
k := ϕm|Um
k is a C1-map and is C1-extendable to some
open neighborhood of Ukm for all k = 1, 2, . . . , i(m).
Remark 10.8 If we would not suppose that the sets Um
k are Borel and have compact
closure but would suppose that they are connected then condition (PC) would be
equivalent to condition (H0) and (H1) of Sect.10.2
Given ϕ : U →M satisfying (PC) and u ∈U we deﬁne the singular value function
of ϕ by ωd(ϕ, u) := ωd(duϕ) where duϕ : TuM →Tϕ(u)M is the tangent map of
the C1-extension of ϕ.
Let us state the main result [27].
Theorem 10.9 Suppose ϕ : U →M satisfying condition (PC). Let K be a compact
ϕ-invariant, i.e. ϕ(K) = K, subset of U. If we have a number d ∈(0, n] such that
sup
x∈K
ωd(ϕ, x) < 1 and ∀m ∈N ∀k ∈{1, . . . , i(m)} :
μH

K ∩(Um
k \ Um
k ), d
	
= 0
then dimH K ≤d holds.
Remark 10.9 We compare this result with Theorem 10.5 of Sect.10.2 about the
Hausdorff dimension estimates for invariant sets piecewise smooth maps. We
replaced condition (H2) of this section by the assumption that the intersection of
K with the singularity set and its preimages has zero d-dimensional Hausdorff mea-
sure. We will see in Subsect. 10.3.3 that Theorem 10.9 is applicable in situations
were Theorem 10.5 of Sect.10.2 is not applicable.
Remark 10.10 In some situations it is useful to replace the map ϕ by a power of ϕ
in order to get better dimension estimates by Theorem 10.9.
In the following corollary of Theorem 10.9 we introduce a Lyapunov function κ
into the dimension estimate.
Corollary 10.10 Suppose ϕ : U →M satisfying condition (PC). Let K be a com-
pact ϕ-invariant, i.e. ϕ(K) = K, subset of U. If we have a number d ∈(0, n] and a
continuous function κ : K →R+ := {u ∈R|u > 0} such that

Proof of the Main Result
The following lemma is essential for the proof of Theorem 10.9:
Lemma 10.6 Suppose that ϕ : U →M satisﬁes condition (PC). Furthermore sup-
pose that for d ∈(0, n], m ∈N and for a compact ϕ-invariant set K the inequality
supu∈K ωd(ϕm, u) < δ holds. Then there exists an ε0 such that for all ε ∈(0, ε0] we

We need one another simple lemma that is about the singular value function.
Lemma 10.7 Suppose ϕ : U →M satisfying condition (PC). Let K be a compact
ϕ-invariant, i.e. ϕ(K) = K subset of U and let d ∈(0, n]. Then we have
sup
u∈K
ωd(ϕm, u) ≤(sup
u∈K
ωd(ϕ, u))m.
Proof This lemma follows immediately from Proposition7.14 of Sect.7. The proof
can be done in exactly the same way as in the usual situation of C1 maps (see the
corresponding statements in Chap. 5.
□
Proof of Theorem 10.9 . We know from Lemma 10.7 that if supu∈K ωd(ϕ, u) < 1
holds we have
lim
m→∞sup
u,∈K
ωd(ϕm, u) = 0.
Hence under ﬁrst assumptions of our theorem there exist m ∈N and δ ≥0 such
that C(d)δ < 1, c(d)δ1/d < 1 and supu∈K ωd(ϕm, u) < δ. Using c(d)δ1/d < 1 and
the invariance of K we have

K, d, c(d)δ1/dε

(ϕm(K), d, c(d)δ1/dε

version of the Belykh map is due to by Pesin [30] who studied ergodic properties of
this map. Dimensional theoretical properties of the Belykh attractor were studied by
Schmeling [35].
We want to apply Theorem 10.9 to these systems.

and let K be a compact set which is invariant under ϕδ. Then
dimH K ≤1 −log δ2/ log δ1.
Proof Let d = (1 −log δ2/ log δ1) + ε where ε > 0. Note that d > 1. The singu-

Remark 10.11
(a) Estimate 10.1 only gives some information if δ2 < δ−1
1 . If this is not the case we
have the trivial estimate by dimension two.
(b) Schmeling [35] showed that for almost all parameter values (with some tech-
nical restrictions) the Hausdorff dimension of the Belykh attractor is given by
min{2, 1 −log δ2/ log δ1}. Thus if δ2 < δ−1
1
the estimate obtained by Theorem
10.9 is at least generically sharp.
(c) In Sect.10.2 it is remarked that we could not apply Theorem 10.5 to the Belykh
systems in general. Thus we see that there are situations where Theorem 10.9 is
more appropriate.
The Lozi Systems. Now for b ∈(0, 1) and a ∈(0, 2(1 −b)) we consider the class

ϕa,b : [−1/(1 −b), 1/(1 −b)]2 →[−1/(1 −b), 1/(1 + b)]2
ϕa,b(x, y) = (1 + by −a|x|, x).
The Lozi map (see Fig.10.5) was introduced by Lozi [24]. Ergodic properties of
the map were studied in [7] and estimates of the Hausdorff dimension were given by
Ishii [15].
By Theorem 10.9 we get the following dimension estimate.

Furthermore assume that β2 < 1. Then we have
dimH K ≤1 −log β1/ log β2.
Proof Let d = 1 −log β1 log β2 + ε where ε > 0. Note that for all (x, y) ∈[−1/

more the singularity set of the system ([−1/(1 −b), 1/(1 −b)]2, ϕa,b) is given

and that in some parts of the parameter space this upper bound is at least generically
sharp (in the sense of Lebesgue measure). This example shows that the estimates
obtained by Theorem 10.9 can not be expected to be sharp in general. The problem is
that the singular value function is not constant here and Douady-Oesterlé-type esti-
mates take the worst contraction rates of the system everywhere into consideration.
If we consider the symmetric case β1 = β2 and β3 = β4 the singular value function
is constant and the estimate in Theorem 10.9 is generically sharp (see again [26]).

Frequency-Domain Conditions for Lower Topological
Dimension Bounds of Global B-Attractors
In this subsection we derive a lower topological dimension estimate of a global B-
attractor which is based on the results of [18]. Clearly (see Proposition 3.20, Chap.3)
that such a bound is also a lower bound for the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions.
Suppose that a discrete-time system in Rn is given by
ut+1 = Aut + b φ ((c, ut)),
(10.49)
where A is an n × n matrix, b and c are n-vectors, φ : R →R is a continuous
piecewise linear function having only a countable set of discontinuities of the ﬁrst
derivative Z := {σ j | j = 1, 2, . . .}. We suppose that all points of Z are isolated in
a strong sense, i.e. there exists a number τ > 0 such that
| σi −σ j | ≥τ,
∀σi, σ j ∈Z, i ̸= j.
Let us also assume that
det(A + bc∗φ′(σ)) ̸= 0,
∀σ ∈R\Z,

and that there exist two real numbers κ1 < 0 and κ2 > 0 such that
(φ′(σ) −κ1) (φ′(σ) −κ2) ≥0,
∀σ ∈R\Z.

Denotethediscrete-timedynamicalsystem,generatedthrough(10.49)by{ϕt}t∈N0.
We assume that this dynamical system has a global minimal B-attractor ARn,min. The
next theorem [18] gives a lower estimate for the topological dimension of this attrac-
tor.
Theorem 10.10 Suppose that there is a number θ > 2 such that the following con-
ditions are satisﬁed:
(1) The matrix 1
θ (A + κ1bc∗) has m eigenvalues (1 ≤m ≤n) outside the unit circle

∀z ∈C, | z | = 1.
Then dimT ARn,min ≥m.
Proof According to conditions (1) and (2) of the theorem we can use the Kalman-
Szegö theorem (Theorem 2.10, Chap.2) to conclude that there exists a real symmetric
n × n matrix P such that

ξ −κ1(c, u)

∀u ∈Rn, ∀ξ ∈R,
|u| + |ξ| ̸= 0.
Here (·, ·) denotes the scalar product in Rn. If we put in (10.52) ξ = κ1(c, u), u ∈Rn,
we get the inequality

θ2

P(A + κ1bc∗)u, (A + κ1bc∗)u
	
−(Pu, u) < 0,
∀u ∈Rn, u ̸= 0.
From this, condition (1) of the theorem and Lemma 2.8, Chap.2, it follows that
the matrix P has m negative and n −m positive eigenvalues.

It follows from the inequality (10.53) that at most one hyperplane of the type
{u | (c, u) = σ j, σ j ∈Z} can intersect Bδ(u0). Then there exists a point u1 ∈Bδ(u0)
∩L0
m such that the ball Bδ/2(u1) is included in Bδ(u0) and Bδ/2(u1) does not intersect
the hyperplane {u | (c, u) = σ j}. It follows from (10.51) to (10.52) that for ∈Bδ/2(u1)
we have the inequality
V (ϕ1(υ) −ϕ1(u1)) ≤θ2V (υ −u1).
From this, the inequality θ > 2 and the special representation of V it follows that
Bδ(ϕ1(u1)) ∩L1
m ⊂ϕ1(Bδ/2(u1) ∩L0
m),
where L1
m is the linear set spanned by the elements of the set ϕ1(Bδ/2(u1) ∩L0
m).
It is easy to see that according to the piecewise linearity of φ and the choice of
Bδ/2(u1) the set L1
m is a linear m-dimensional subspace of Rn. Note that the ball
Bδ(ϕ1(u1)) according to (10.53) can intersect the hyperplane {u | (c, u) = σ j} at most
for one σ j ∈Z. The preimage of the intersection of the hyperplane with Bδ(ϕ1(u1))
is also part of some hyperplane. This follows from the fact that the inverse map
ϕ−1 := (ϕ1)−1 exists as a linear and regular map on the set Bδ(ϕ1(u1)). It is evident
that there exists a vector u2 ∈Bδ/2(u1) ∩L0
m such that Bδ/4(u2) ⊂Bδ/2(u1) and the
ball Bδ/4(u2) does not have intersections with the set
ϕ−1
{u | (c, u) = σ j} ∩Bδ(ϕ1(u1)
	
.
Again from (10.51) and (10.52) it is follows that, for each υ ∈Bδ/4(u2), we have
the inequality
V (ϕ2(υ) −ϕ2(u2)) ≤θ4V (υ −u2).
From this, the inequality θ > 2 and from the special structure of V it follows that
Bδ(ϕ2(u2)) ∩L2
m ⊂ϕ2(Bδ/4(u2) ∩L0
m),
where L2
m is the linear set spanned by the elements of the set ϕ2(Bδ/4(u2) ∩L0
m).
If we continue this procedure we get sequences of points {uk}∞
k=0 and of linear m-
dimensional sets {Lk
m}∞
k=0 such that
Bδ(ϕk(uk)) ∩Lk
m ⊂ϕk(Bδ(u0)).
Since the sequence {ϕk(uk)}∞
k=0 belongs for all sufﬁciently large k to an ε-
neighborhood of the bounded global B-attractor ARn,min, this sequence is bounded.
Thuswecanchooseasubsequenceki →∞suchthatϕki(uki) →u asi →∞,where
u ∈Rn is some point. But then we also ﬁnd a subsequence, which we denote again
by {ki}, such that the sets B2δ(u) ∩Lkim converge in the following sense: there exists
a linear m-dimensional subspace Lm such that for each υ ∈B2δ(u) ∩Lm we have

dist(υ, B2δ(u) ∩Lkim) →0 as i →∞. Here dist(υ, Z) denotes the distance between
a point υ ∈Rn and a set Z ⊂Rn. But this implies that Bδ/2(u) ∩Lm ⊂ARn,min.
From Proposition 3.3, Chap.3, it follows that
dimT (Bδ/2(u) ∩Lm) = m ≤dimT ARn,min.

It is easy to generalize Theorem 10.10 to the situation where system (10.49)

exists a vector Δ ∈Rn, Δ ̸= 0, such that
ϕt(u + kΔ) = ϕt(u) + kΔ,
t = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
u ∈Rn.
(10.54)
If this property is given, system (10.49) can be considered on the ﬂat cylinder
Rn/G with G := {kΔ | k ∈Z}. W.l.o.g. we can assume that system (10.49) is given

∀σ ∈R.
(10.56)
Here A0 is an (n −1) × (n −1) matrix having all eigenvalues inside the unit disc,
c0 and b0 are (n −1)-vectors and qo is a real number.
The transfer function W for the linear part of (10.49), (10.55), and (10.56) is given
by

system on the ﬂat cylinder Rn/G with G = {kΔ | k ∈Z}, Δ∗= (0, 0, . . . , 2π), has
a global minimal B-attractor ARn/G,min.

κ2 =: κ.
Note that such a discrete-time dynamical system describes, for example, period-
ically kicked rotators [37] or systems of phase synchronization [22].
It follows from the stability of A0 and the boundedness of φ that the system
given by (10.58) is dissipative on the cylinder Rn/G (see the proof of Proposition
1.6, Chap.1). According to Proposition 1.6, Chap.1, there exists a minimal global
B-attractor ARn/G,min.
Let us check the conditions of Theorem 10.11. Assume that θ > 0 is a number.
Then the eigenvalues of 1
θ (A + κ1bc∗) are the zeros of the polynomial (θz −1)(θz −
β1) −κβ2θz. Thus the assumptions (1) and (2) of Theorem 10.11 are satisﬁed if

Corollary 10.11 Suppose:

(c) ϕt is one-to-one on C and ϕt(C) = C for some t > 0.
Then dimH AE ≥m + 1.
Proof Let : U →D betheparameterized(m + 1)-surfaceinD suchthat(∂U) =
C ⊂AE. Let k := , k = 1, 2, . . . . Since (U) is bounded, {k} is a bounded
sequence of parameterized (m + 1)-surfaces in D. Since ϕt is one-to-one on C, if
tk := kt, Proposition B.2, Appendix B implies that the boundaries ∂(ϕkt ◦k) =

TheestimationtechniqueofM.Y.LiandJ.S.Muldowney,representedinTheorem

surface as deﬁning a continuous linear functional on the space of differential m-forms
with compact support. In Sect. B.6, Appendix B we have brieﬂy sketched the ideas
from geometric measure theory needed for our presentation. The following are due
to [32].
Let us assume that a C∞-smooth dynamical system ({ϕt}t∈T, Rn, | · |) is given.
Theorem 10.13 Suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) The set A ≡ARn is the global B-attractor of the dynamical system {ϕt}t∈T ;
(ii) There is a sequence {Tk}∞
k=1 of (m + 1)-dimensional real ﬂat chains such that
∞
k=1 supp Tk is bounded, and there exists a sequence of times {tk}∞
k=1, tk ∈T,
such that ϕtk∗Tk ↛0 as k →∞.
Then dimH A ≥m + 1.
In order to prove this theorem we need the following lemma.
Lemma 10.8 Let T be a k-dimensional real ﬂat chain T ̸= 0. Then dimH (supp T ) ≥
m + 1.
Proof Suppose that dimH (supp T ) < m + 1. Then the property (P4), Subsect. 3.2.1,
Chap.3, implies that μH(supp T, m + 1) = 0. From Theorem B.5, Appendix B it
follows that T = 0. But this contradicts our assumption.

10.4 Lower Dimension Estimates

Proof (of Theorem 10.13) Let ε > 0 and δ > 0 be arbitrary numbers and {Bi}i≥1 be
a countable cover of A by balls of radius ri ≤δ such that

i≥1
rm+1
i
≤μH(A, m + 1, δ) + ε.
(10.59)
Since A attracts bounded sets there exists a t0 ∈T such that for all t ≥t0, t ∈T,
we have
ϕt 
k≥1
supp Tk
	
⊂

i≥1
Bi.
In particular,
ϕtk(supp Tk) ⊂

i≥1
Bi,
(10.60)
when k is large enough.
Since (see Sect. B.6, Appendix B) supp (ϕtk∗Tk) ⊂ϕtk(supp Tk) for k = 1, 2, . . . ,
we get from (10.60) that
supp (ϕtk
∗Tk) ⊂

i≥1
Bi ,
(10.61)
when k is large enough.
From Lemma 10.8 it follows that there exists a δ′ > 0 and a subsequence {tki}∞
i=1
of {tk}∞
k=1 such that (with δ from (10.59))
0 < δ′ ≤μH(supp ϕ
tki
∗Tki, m + 1, δ).
(10.62)
Now it follows from (10.59), (10.61), and (10.62) that
δ′ ≤μH(supp ϕ
tki
∗Tki, m + 1, δ) ≤μH
 
i≥1
Bi, m + 1, δ
	
≤μH(A, m + 1, δ) + ε.
But this implies μH(A, m + 1) > 0. From (P4), Chap. 3, it follows that dimH A ≥
m + 1.
□
Remark 10.14 The Koch curve K(φ1, φ2) of Subsect. 3.2.3, Chap.3, supports an 1-
dimensional integral ﬂat chain T with supp T ⊂K(φ1, φ2). The construction of such
T for K(φ1, φ2), and, more general, for arbitrary self-similar sets K(φ1, . . . , φm), is
considered in [14]. In particular such integral ﬂat chains can be used, in order to
verify the conditions of Theorem 10.13.

Dimension Estimates for Dynamical Systems …
Remark 10.15 Various types of other functionals for the Hausdorff dimension esti-
mation are used by Leonov [19] and by Leonov and Florynskii [21]. These function-
als are called Hausdorff-Lebesgue functionals [19] and, more general, Hausdorff
functionals [21]. In a number of dimension estimations for attractors of dynamical
systems the use of such functionals seems to be more efﬁcient than the direct use of
the outer Hausdorff measures.

A.1
Deﬁnition of a Differentiable Manifold
In this section we shall repeat some well-known facts and basic deﬁnitions on dynam-
ical systems on ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds. Suppose M is an arbitrary set. An n-
dimensional chart on M is a bijection x : D(x) ⊂M →R(x) ⊂Rn, where R(x)
is open in Rn.
An n-dimensional atlas of class Ck (k ≥0) on M is a set A of n-dimensional
charts such that:
(AT1)

x∈A
D(x) = M ;
(AT2)
x(D(x) ∩D(y)) is open in Rn for arbitrary x, y ∈A ;
(AT3)
The map y ◦x−1 : x(D(x) ∩D(y)) →y(D(x) ∩D(y)) is of class Ck for
each x, y ∈A.
Suppose A is an n-dimensional atlas of class Ck on M and x is an arbitrary n-
dimensional chart on M. This chart is Ck-compatible with A if A ∪{x} is also an
n-dimensional Ck-atlas on M. An n-dimensional atlas of class Ck is called maximal
if any Ck-compatible n-dimensional chart on M belongs to A. Denote this (unique)
maximal atlas by Amax. A pair (M, Amax), where M is a set and Amax is the maximal
n-dimensional Ck-atlas on M, is called n-dimensional Ck-manifold. The family of
sets S := {D(x) ⊂M|x ∈Amax} can be considered as the basis for a topology. The
topology on M which is generated by S is the canonical topology Tcan. In the sequel,
we assume that any n-dimensional Ck-manifold is Hausdorff, i.e. any two distinct
points in M have disjunct neighborhoods.
Note that any n-dimensional Ck-manifold is locally compact, i.e. each point in
M has a compact neighborhood. It follows that any manifold is regular, i.e. each
point has, together with an open neighborhood, also a closed neighborhood. Any
n-dimensional Ck-manifold is locally connected, i.e. each neighborhood of a point
contains a connected neighborhood. An open set U of an n-dimensional Ck-manifold

M considered with a topology which is induced from the canonical topology of M,
is an n-dimensional Ck-manifold.
If M and N are n- and m-dimensional Ck-manifolds with the atlas AM and AN ,
respectively, then the cartesian product M × N, associated with the atlas
A = {x × y : D(x) × D(y) →R(x) × R(y), x ∈AM, y ∈AN },isan(n + m)-
dimensional Ck-manifold, which is called a product manifold.
Example A.1 (a) The space Rn can be considered as an n-dimensional
C∞-manifold. A C∞-atlas for Rn is A = {id} with id: Rn →Rn being the identical
map. The maximal C∞-atlas contains as charts all C∞-diffeomorphisms
x : D(x) ⊂Rn →R(x) ⊂Rn
with D(x) and R(x) open.
(b) Suppose Γ =

is a discrete subgroup of Rn, e1, . . . , em with
m ≤n are elements of the canonical basis. Consider the canonical projection π :
Rn →Rn/Γ deﬁned as υ ∈Rn →[υ] = υ + Γ.
An n-dimensional atlas for Rn/Γ is given by A = {π−1
|π(U)|π(U) →U , U ⊂Rn
open, π : U →Rn/Γ is injective}. Then the n-dimensional C∞-manifold (Rn/Γ,
Amax) is called a (ﬂat) cylinder. If m = n the (ﬂat) cylinder is called (ﬂat) torus.
The next theorem is called Brouwer’s theorem on the invariance of domain [3, 6].
Theorem A.1 Let S be an arbitrary subset of the n-dimensional Euclidean space En
and φ a homeomorphism of S on another subset φ(S) of En. Then if u is an interior
point of S (with respect to En), φ(u) is an interior point of φ(S) (with respect to
En). In particular, if S and S′ are homeomorphic subsets of En and S is open, then
S′ is open.
Remark A.1 (a) Theorem A.1 remains true if the n-dimensional Euclidean space
En is replaced by an arbitrary n-dimensional Ck-manifold M: For every point
of S there is a neighborhood in M which is homeomorphic to En.
(b) As it is mentioned in [6] Theorem A.1 includes the Theorem on invariance of
dimension of Euclidean spaces, i.e. En and Em are homeomorphic if and only if
n = m.
The following classiﬁcation theorem for smooth one-dimensional connected man-
ifolds can be found in [9].
Theorem A.2 Any connected C∞-smooth one-dimensional manifold is diffeomor-
phic either to S1 or to some interval of R.
Let us note that an interval of R is any connected subset of R different from a point.
An interval can be ﬁnite or inﬁnite, closed, open or semi-open. Since any interval is
diffeomorphic either to [0, 1], to (0, 1] or (0, 1), the above theorem says that there
are exactly four different types of connected one-dimensional C∞-manifolds.

The deﬁnition of a manifold with boundary M is similar to the deﬁnition of a
manifold without boundary. However there are now two kinds of charts. Let Rn
+
denote the region Rn
+ = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn  x1 ≥0}. In some charts x : D(x) ⊂
M →R(x), the domain D(x) is mapped onto a certain open subset of Rn, in some
other charts y : D(y) ⊂M →R(y) the domain D(y) is mapped onto a certain
(relative) open subset of Rn
+. As before, the chart’s domains {D(x)} cover M, and
two different charts deﬁne differentiable transition functions. The boundary ∂M of
M is by deﬁnition the set of all points of M whose images under charts lie on the
boundaryofRn

manifold of the same class as M.
A.2
Tangent Space, Tangent Bundle and Differential
Suppose that M is an n-dimensional Ck-manifold. If p ∈M is a point, x and y
are two arbitrary charts around p and ξ, η ∈Rn, then we introduce the equivalence
relation (p, x, ξ) ∼(p, y, η) ⇔η = (y ◦x−1)′(x(p)) ξ. The equivalence class
[p, x, ξ] := {(p, y, η)|(p, y, η) ∼(p, x, ξ)}
is called tangent vector at p. The tangent space of M at p ∈M is the set TpM
of all equivalence classes [p, x, ξ] such that p ∈D(x) and connected with a vector
space structure given by
(1)
[p, x, ξ] + [p, x, η] := [p, x, ξ + η] , ∀ξ, η ∈Rn ;
(2)
λ[p, x, ξ] := [p, x, λ ξ] , ∀λ ∈R, ∀ξ ∈Rn .
It can be shown that this deﬁnition is correct, i.e. does not depend on the chart x.
The tangent bundle T M of M is deﬁned by T M := 
p∈M
TpM and the natural
projection π is given by π : T M →M with [p, x, ξ] →p.
It can be shown that T M can be considered as Hausdorff 2 n-dimensional Ck−1-
manifold.
Suppose that M and N are n-dimensional Ck-manifolds. The map φ : M →N
is said to be Cr-differentiable (1 ≤r ≤k) at p ∈M if there are charts x around
p and y around φ(p) such that the map y ◦φ ◦x−1 is Cr-differentiable in x(p). It
is easy to see that the deﬁnition does not depend on the charts x and y. The map
φ : M →N is called Cr-differentiable if φ is Cr-differentiable at any point of M,
and is called a Cr-diffeomorphism if φ is bijective, φ is Cr-differentiable on M and
φ−1 is Cr-differentiable on N.
Suppose that φ : M →N is of class C1. The differential of φ at p ∈M is the
linear map dpφ : TpM →Tφ(p)N given by
dpφ

[p, x, ξ]

=
	
φ(p), y, (y ◦φ ◦x−1)′(x(p))ξ

,

Appendix A: Basic Facts from Manifold Theory
where x is a chart at p ∈M, y is a chart at φ(p). One can easily show that this
deﬁnition is independent of x and y.
The
rank
of
the
differential
dφ
at
p
is
deﬁned
by
rank
(dpφ)
= rank(y ◦φ ◦x−1)′(x(p)), where x and y are arbitrary charts around p and φ(p),
respectively.
If N = Rn we can write T Rn ∼= Rn × Rn and d φ : T M →Rn × Rn is deﬁned
by
dφ ([p, x, ξ]) := (φ (p), (φ ◦x−1)′(x(p)) ξ) .
In particular one can show that, if x is a chart on M then dx([p, x, ξ]) = (x(p),
(x ◦x−1)′(x(p))ξ) = (x(p), ξ) is a chart and {dx|x ∈A} is a 2 n-dimensional Ck−1-
atlas on T M.
The subset Z of the n-dimensional Ck-manifold M is said to be a submanifold if
there is a natural m < n such that any point p ∈Z belongs to a domain D(x) with
x(D(x) ∩Z) = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈R(x)|xm+1 = · · · = xn = 0}
= R(x) ∩Rm × {0} .
The Cr-differentiable map φ : M →N is at p ∈M called regular if
rank(dpφ) = min(n, m).Ifφ isatanypointregular,themapiscalledCr-submersion,
if n ≥m, Cr-immersion if n ≤m, and Cr-embedding, if n ≤m and φ maps home-
omorphly the manifold M on φ(M).
Whitney’s embedding theorem [16] states the following. If M is a compact Cr-
manifold of dimension n, then there exists a Cr-embedding φ : M →R2n+1. Let
M be a Cr-manifold of dimension n. We say that the set Z ⊂M has the Lebesgue
measure zero if there exists a sequence of charts xi : D(xi) →R(xi), i = 1, 2, . . . ,
such that Z ⊂∞
i=1 D(xi) and μL(xi(D(xi) ∩Z)) = 0 for every i = 1, 2, . . .. (Here
μL(·) denotes the Lebesgue measure in Rn.)
Suppose that M and N are Cr-manifolds of dimension n and m, respectively and
φ : M →N is a Cs-map, s ≤r. A point q ∈N is called a regular value of φ if
the map dpφ : TpM →TqN is surjective for any p ∈φ−1(q). The point q ∈N is
called a critical value of φ if q is not regular. The point p ∈M is called a critical
point of φ if there exists a critical value q ∈N of φ such that p ∈φ−1(q).
Let us state now Sard’s theorem [13], the proof of which can be found in many
books.
Theorem A.3 Let M and N be Cr-manifolds, r ≥1, of dimension n and m, respec-
tively,φ : M →N aCs-map,max{0, n −m} < s ≤r.Thenthesetofcriticalvalues
of φ has the Lebesgue measure zero.

Tensor Products, Exterior Products and Tensor Fields
Suppose that M is an n-dimensional Cr-manifold, p ∈M is an arbitrary point, x a
chartaround p.Bythischart x : D(x) →R(x),wedeﬁneanassociatedisomorphism
Θp,x : TpM →Rn given by Θp,x([p, x, ξ]) := ξ ∈Rn . We call ξ the representant
of the tangent vector in the chart x. If e1, . . . , en is the canonical basis in Rn, we
deﬁne by bi := Θ−1
p,x(ei), i = 1, . . . , n, a basis in TpM. Let C∞(M, R) be the linear
space of C∞-functions over M. Then every tangent vector [p, x, ξ] ∈TpM can be
identiﬁed with the following map:
∂[p,x,ξ] : C∞(M, R) →TpM , φ →dpφ ([p, x, ξ]) = [φ (p), id, (φ ◦x−1)′(x(p))ξ] ,
i.e. with the directional derivative of φ in direction [p, x, ξ]. This means that ∂i(p) ≡
bi is the canonical basis of TpM.
In order to deﬁne a canonical basis for the cotangential space T ∗
p M ≡(TpM)∗we
introduce the projection π2 : Rn × Rn →Rn by π2(u, υ) = υ. The dual basis Θi ≡
dxi of T ∗
p M is deﬁned by Θi = ei ◦π2 ◦dx ∈T ∗
p M and acts as Θi([p, x, ξ]) =
ei(π2(dpx([p, x, ξ])) = ei(π2(x(p)ξ)) = ei(ξ) = ξi ∈R .
Since Θi(∂j) = Θi(dpx−1(x(p), e j)) = ei(π2(dpx(dpx−1(x(p), e j)))) =
ei(π2(x(p), e j)) = ei(e j) = δi
j we see that Θi(p) is indeed the dual basis to ∂j(p).
For arbitrary numbers k, h ∈N0 and p ∈M we introduce the sets

One can show again that if M is an n-dimensional Hausdorff Cr-manifold then
T k
h M has the canonical structure of an n + nh+k-dimensional Hausdorff Cr−1-
manifold. Analogously one shows that k T ∗M = 

k T ∗
p M is a smooth man-
ifold. Denote by πk
h : T k
h M →M the projection operator. A Cm-tensor ﬁeld of the
type (k, h) on M is a Cm-section of the bundle T k
h M, i.e. a Cm-map S : M →T k
h M
with πk
h ◦S = idM. The tensor ﬁeld of type (1, 0) is also called a (contravariant)
vector ﬁeld. Tensor ﬁelds of the type (0, h) we call h-times covariant tensor ﬁelds.
A Cm-smooth differential form β of degree h (or an h-form of smoothness Cm) on
M is a Cm-section of the bundle k(T ∗M), i.e. a Cm-map β : M →k(T ∗M).
If β is a k-form and β is an l-form on M the wedge product β ∧β is a k + l-form
on M deﬁned by (β ∧β)p = βp ∧βp, ∀p ∈M. The exterior derivative d for k-
forms is deﬁned as follows. If β is a k-form of class Cr,r ≥2, on M then dβ is a
(k + 1)-form of class Cr−1 such that the following conditions are satisﬁed:

514
Appendix A: Basic Facts from Manifold Theory
(i) If β is a 0-form, i.e. β = φ a Cr-function on M then dβ is the differential;
(ii) If β, β are k-forms of class Cr then d(β + β) = dβ + dβ ;
(iii) If β and β are k-resp. l-forms of smoothness Cr on M then
d(β ∧β) = dβ ∧β + (−1)kβ ∧dβ ;
(iv) d(dβ) = 0 for any k-form β of class Cr .
A k-form on M is called closed if dβ = 0 and exact if β = dβ for some (k −1)-
form β. Suppose that M and N are Ck-smooth n-resp. m-dimensional manifolds,
φ : M →N is a Cr-map (r ≤k) and β is a k-form (k ≥1) on N. The pullback of
β is the k-form φ∗β on M deﬁned by
(φ∗β)p(υ1, . . . , υk) = βφ (p)(dpφ υ1, . . . , dpφ υk) ,
∀p ∈M, ∀υ1, . . . , υk ∈TpM .
If φ : M →N is a Cr-diffeomorphism, the k-form φ∗β on N deﬁned by
(φ∗β)φ (p)(dpφ υ1, . . . , dpφ υp) = β(υ1, . . . , υk) ,
∀p ∈M, ∀υ1, . . . , υk ∈TpM .
is called push-forward of β. Given a Cr-smooth k-form β and a vector ﬁeld F on
M, the interior product of β and F is a (k −1)-form which we denote by β⌟F
and which is deﬁned by (β⌟F)p(υ1, . . . , υk−1) = βp(F(p), υ1, . . . , υk−1), ∀p ∈
M, ∀υ1, . . . , υk ∈TpM . The Lie derivative of β in direction F is the k-form L pβ
given by L Fβ = d(β⌟F) + dβ⌟F. Note that if β is a 0-form, i.e. a function, then
L Fβ = dβ⌟F.

Riemannian Manifolds
A Riemannian manifold is a connected n-dimensional Cr-manifold equipped with
a 2-covariant Cr-smooth tensor ﬁeld g (the Riemannian metric) with the following
properties.
(i) g is symmetric;
(ii) For any p ∈M the bilinear form g|p is non-degenerate, i.e. from gp(υ, w) =
0, ∀υ ∈TpM, it follows that w = 0 .
The Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called proper if gp(υ, υ) > 0, ∀p ∈M,
∀υ ∈TpM, υ ̸= 0. In other case (M, g) is called pseudo-Riemannian.
Remark A.2 (a) A Riemannian metric of class Cr(1 ≤r ≤k −1) can be deﬁned
on an n-dimensional Ck-manifold if at any point p ∈M and any chart x around p
there is given a positive deﬁnite (symmetric) n × n matrix Gx(p) with the following
properties:

and y around p.
(b) Let us write the metric tensor in the canonical basis. In the dual basis {Θi} of
T ∗
p M the tensor g at the point p can be written as
gp(υ, w) = gi jΘiΘ j(υ, w) = gi jυiw j,
where υ = υi∂i , w = wi∂j
and
gi j = g|p(∂i, ∂j) .
If c : [a, b] →M is a continuous curve on the Riemannian n-dimensional Ck-
manifold (M, g) with c|(a,b) ∈C1 then ℓ(c) :=
 b
a ∥˙c (t)∥dt is the length of c.
A piecewise C1-curve on M is a continuous map c (·) : [a, b] for which there
exists a ﬁnite number of points a = t1 < t2 < · · · < tm = b such that c|(ti,ti+1)(i =
1, . . . , m −1) is C1. The length of this piecewise C1-curve c is
ℓ(c) :=
m−1

i=1
ℓ(c|(ti,ti+1)).
Denote for arbitrary points p, q ∈M by Cq
p the set of all piecewise C1-curves from
p to q. One shows that for any such points Cq
p ̸= ∅. The geodesic distance on M
is a function ρ : M × M →R deﬁned by ρ (p, q) = inf
c∈Cq
p
ℓ(c). As an important
property of ρ, it follows that ρ is a metric on M. The topology Tρ, generated by ρ
coincides with the canonical topology Tcan.
The set U ⊂M is called Lebesgue measurable if for any x ∈Amax the set
x(U ∩D(x)) ⊂Rn is Lebesgue measurable. The function f : U ⊂M →R is said
to be measurable if U is measurable and for any x ∈Amax the function f ◦x−1 is
measurable on x(U ∩D(x)).
If x : D(x) →R(x) is a chart and gi j is the metric tensor in this chart then the
n-form
μ =

det(gi j) dx1 ∧· · · ∧dxn
is the canonical volume form on M.
Suppose U ⊂D(x) is measurable. The function f : U →R is integrable on U

Covariant Derivative
Consider an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g) of the class Cr with r ≥2.
Suppose that p ∈M is an arbitrary point, x is a chart around p and gi j(p) is the
metric tensor in this chart. Denote for anyi, j, m from {1, . . . , n} the partial derivative
of the metric tensor by
gi j,m := ∂(gi j ◦x−1)(x(p))
∂xm
.
The n3 functions Γ k
i j : D(x) →R deﬁned by Γ k
i j := 1
2 gks[−gi j,s + g js,i + gsi, j] are
the Christoffel symbols of the second kind on M, computed with respect to the
chart x.
Suppose that x : D(x) →R(x) is an arbitrary chart, Γ k
i j are the Christoffel sym-
bols of the second kind in this chart, {∂i(p)} is the canonial basis of TpM for
p ∈D(x), F is a Cs-vector ﬁeld (1 ≤s ≤r −1) on M written as
F(p) = f i∂i(p), ∀p ∈D(x), and υ ∈TpM is an arbitrary vector given as υ =
υ j∂j(p). Then ∇i f k := ∂f k
∂xi + Γ k
i j f j is called the covariant derivative of f k(x1,
. . . , xn) with respect to xi and ∇υ F(p) := ∇i f k∂k(p)υi is called the covariant
derivative of F in the direction υ.
The linear operator ∇F(p) : TpM →TpM deﬁned by υ ∈TpM →∇υ F(p)
is the covariant derivative of F at p. In a chart x : D(x) →R(x) around p this li-
near operator is given by (υi) →
	 ∂f k
∂xi + Γ k
i j f j
υi , where υ = υi∂i(p) and F(p) =
f i(x(p))∂j(p). If β : M →R is a C1-smooth function (0-form), the gradient of β
is the vector ﬁeld grad β deﬁned by
⟨grad β(p), υ ⟩TpM = dpβ(υ), ∀p ∈M, ∀υ ∈TpM.
In a chart x around p, the canonical basis {∂i(p)} of TpM and with the me-
tric tensor gli(p) = ⟨∂l, ∂i ⟩TpM, we can write for υ = υi∂i(p)⟨grad β(p), υ⟩TpM =
⟨al∂l, υi∂i⟩TpM = glialυi = ∂β
∂x j υ j. It follows that gljal = ∂β
∂x j and as = gsj ∂β
∂x j .
This means that in the chart x the gradient vector ﬁeld grad β is given as grad β(p) =
gsj ∂β
∂x j ∂s(p).

Vector Fields
Suppose that M and N are Ck-manifolds of dimension n and m, respectively. The
map φ : M →N satisﬁes on M a local Lipschitz condition if in any chart x of M
around p and any chart y of N the map
y ◦φ ◦x−1 : x(D(x) ∩φ−1(D(y)) →R(y)
satisﬁes the usual local Lipschitz condition in Rn. Assume that F : M →T M is
a vector ﬁeld, x : D(x) →R(x) is a chart around p. Then F(p) can be written as
F(p) = [p, x, f (x(p))] where f (x(p)) = (π2 ◦dx ◦F ◦x−1)(x(p)) we call f =
( f 1, . . . , f n) the representant of F in the chart x. In the canonical basis {∂j(p)} of
TpM the vector ﬁeld has the form
F(p) = f i(x(p))[p, x, ei] = f i(x(p))∂i(p).
The C1-curve ϕ : (a, b) →M with 0 ∈(a, b) is called an integral curve of the vector
ﬁeld F : M →T M with initial condition p at t = 0 if
˙ϕ(t) = F(ϕ(t)) for all t ∈(a, b)
and ϕ(0) = p. The function ϕ(·) (or ϕ(·, p)) is also called the solution of the differ-
ential equation with ϕ(0) = p. In a chart x : D(x) →R(x), the curve ϕ : (a, b) →
D(x) with ϕ(0) = p is an integral curve of F iff
˙ϕ(t) = f i((x ◦ϕ)(t)) ∂i (ϕ(t)) , i.e. iff σ = (σ 1, . . . , σ n) := x ◦ϕ
is the solution of the ODE in an open set D(x) ⊂Rn, i.e.
˙σ j(t) ∂j (ϕ(t)) = f i(σ(t)) ∂i (ϕ(t))
or
˙σ j(t) = f j(σ 1(t), . . . , σ n(t)) ,
j = 1, . . . , n ,
in D(x) .
The Picard-Lindelöf theorem for vector ﬁelds together with the theorem on unique-
ness in the large, say that if M is an n-dimensional Ck-manifold (k ≥2) and
F : M →T M is a locally Lipschitzian vector ﬁeld, then for every p ∈M there
exists on some open interval J ∋0 an integral curve ϕ of F satisfying ϕ(0) = p.
Moreover, if ϕ1 : J1 →M and ϕ2 : J2 →M are two integral curves of F deﬁned
on open intervals J1 and J2, then ϕ1 = ϕ2 on J1 ∩J2. The above theorems imply
that the union of all integral curves ϕ with ϕ(0) = p of F deﬁned on open inter-
vals is the maximal integral curve ϕ(·, p) of F deﬁned on the maximal exis-
tence interval (ap, bp) with −∞≤ap < 0 < bp ≤+∞. As for ODE’s in Rn the
set D = {(t, p) ∈R × M|ap < t < bp} is open in R × M and the maximal ﬂow

518
Appendix A: Basic Facts from Manifold Theory
ϕ : D →M, (t, p) →ϕ(t, p) is continuous. If D = R × M the local ﬂow is called,
for short, ﬂow.
A vector ﬁeld F is complete if F generates a ﬂow. It can be shown that for any
C2-vector ﬁeld there exists a C1-smooth function ψ : M →R+ such that the vector
ﬁeld ψ F is complete. (Note that ψ F has the same integral curves as F, but different
parametrizations.) A C1-vector ﬁeld on a compact manifold is complete.
Suppose that μ is an arbitrary volume form on M. The divergence of a smooth
vector ﬁeld F w.r.t. μ is the scalar valued function divμF deﬁned by
L Fμ = (divμF)μ. If μ is the canonical volume form μ =

det(gi j) dx1 ∧· · · ∧
dxn then we have divμF = ∇i f i where F = f i∂i in a chart x. Let F be a
Cr-vector ﬁeld on the n-dimensional Ck-manifold M (k ≥2, 1 ≤r ≤k −1), let
({ϕt}t∈R, M, ρ) be the ﬂow of F, ρ : M →R+ a smooth function and μ a volume
form on M.
Then we have, for any Lebesgue measurable set, B ⊂M and arbitrary t ∈R
d


ϕt(B)
ρμ =

ϕt(B)

(Liouville’s theorem).
Let us consider the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R of F on the compact manifold M which preserves the
volume form μ on M, i.e. (ϕt)∗μ = μ, ∀t ∈R. Here (ϕt)∗μ denotes the pull-back
of μ introduced above as
(ϕt)∗μ|p(υ1, . . . , υn) = μ|ϕt(p)(dpϕtυ1, . . . , dpϕtυn), ∀p ∈M, ∀υ1, . . . , υn ∈TpM .
Then for any measurable set S ⊂M with

S
μ > 0 and any T ≥0 there exists a
time t ≥T such that S ∩ϕt(S) ̸= ∅(Poincaré’s theorem).
Analogously one says that {ϕt}t∈R preserves a k-form β, if (ϕt)∗β = β, t ∈R,
i.e. if L Fβ ≡0. If β is a 0-form, i.e. β is a scalar valued function, preserving means
that
(ϕt)∗β|p = β(ϕt(p)) = β(p), ∀t ∈R, ∀p ∈M .
In this case β is a ﬁrst integral of the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R. The vector ﬁeld F is called
conservative with respect to the volume form μ if divμF ≡0 on M. A symplectic
manifold is a pair (M, ω), where M is a 2 n-dimensional Ck-manifold and ω is a
smooth closed non-degenerate two-form, i.e. dω = 0 and ω|p(υ1, υ2) = 0 ∀υ1 ∈
TpM at a point p and for a vector υ2 ∈TpM implies that υ2 = 0.
If p ∈M is ﬁxed the relation υ ∈TpM →ω|p(·, υ) deﬁnes a 1-form on TpM.
Since ω is non-degenerate, this relation is a linear bijection denoted by i. If J := i−1
and β is an arbitrary 1-form on M, the term Jβ is a vector ﬁeld on M. For any
smooth function H : M →R the vector ﬁeld X H := Jd H is called Hamiltonian
and H is the associated Hamiltonian.
On a symplectic manifold (M, ω) for arbitrary smooth functions f, g : M →R
the Poisson bracket between f and g is { f, g} := ω(X f , Xg) = d f (Xg). We say
that f and g are in involution if { f, g} ≡0. A smooth function f : M →R is a ﬁrst
integral of X H on M iff { f, H} = 0 on M.

Spaces of Vector Fields and Maps
Suppose that M is a compact n-dimensional Cr-manifold and Diff1(M) denotes
the set of all C1-diffeomorphisms on M. Since M is compact we can choose a
ﬁnite set of charts xi : D(xi) →R(xi), i = 1, . . . , m, such that m
i=1 D(xi) = M.
For arbitrary ϕ, ψ ∈Diff1(M) and i, j, k ∈{1, . . . , m} we introduce the maps
ϕi j = x j ◦ϕ ◦x−1
i
: R(xi) ∩ϕ−1(D(x j)) →Rn and ψik = xk ◦ψ ◦x−1
i
: R(xi) ∩
ψ−1(D(xk)) →Rn. Let Di jk := R(xi) ∩ϕ−1(D(x j)) ∩ϕ−1(D(xk)) and deﬁne the
value
d1(ϕ, ψ, xi, x j, xk) := max
ξ∈Di jk
|ϕi j(ξ) −ψik(ξ)| + max
ξ∈Di jk
∥Dϕi j(ξ) −Dψik(ξ)∥
where | · | and ∥· ∥denote the Euclidean norm in Rn and the operator norm in Mn(R),
computed w.r.t. | · |, respectively.
Then
d1(ϕ, ψ) := maxi, j,k=1,...,m d1(ϕ, ψ, xi, x j, xk)
deﬁnes
a
metric
in
Diff1(M). Equipped with this metric Diff1(M) is a complete metric space. Suppose
that G ⊂Rn is a domain with compact closure. Introduce the space Diff1(G) as space
of equivalence classes for C1-diffeomorphisms ϕ, ψ : Rn →Rn, i.e. ϕ ∼ψ ⇔
ϕ(x) = ψ(x) ∀x ∈G. For ϕ, ψ ∈Diff(G) we deﬁne d0(ϕ, ψ) = maxx∈G |ϕ(x) −
ψ(x)| and
d1(ϕ, ψ) = d0(ϕ, ψ) + max
x∈G
∥Dϕ(x) −Dψ(x)∥.
Denote by Diffi(G), i = 0, 1, the complete metric space derived from Diff(G) with
metric d0 resp. d1. Let Diff+(G) denote the set of all ϕ ∈Diff(G) with ϕ(G) ⊂
G. The set Diff+(G) is open in Diffi(G), i = 0, 1. Denote Diffi
+(G) := Diffi(G) ∩
Diff+(G).
Let us now consider C1-vector ﬁelds on M. Suppose again that xi : D(xi) →
R(xi) , i = 1, . . . , m, is a ﬁnite set of charts for the compact manifold M with M =
m
i=1 D(xi). Let F, G : M →T M be two C1-smooth vector ﬁelds and denote by
fi and gi the realizations of F and G in the charts xi. Introduce the value
d1(F, G) := max
ξ∈R(xi)
|gi(ξ) −fi(ξ)| +
max
ξ∈R(xi)
∥Dgi(ξ) −Dfi(ξ)∥.
Then d1 is a metric. Denote the metric space of all C1-vector ﬁelds on M with this
metric by X1(M).
Assume that G ⊂U ⊂Rn are open sets, G is compact and G ⊂U. Assume also
that ∂G is a smooth (n −1) dimensional submanifold of Rn. Denote by X1(G) the
set of all equivalence classes of C1-vector ﬁelds f, g : U →Rn w.r.t. the equivalence
relation f ∼g ⇔f (x) = g(x), ∀x ∈G.Anyclass of X1(G) is identiﬁedwithsome
vector ﬁeld f : U →Rn. Now we deﬁne for any f, g ∈X1(G) the value
d1( f, g) := max
x∈G
| f (x) −g(x)| + sup
x∈G
∥Df (x) −Dg(x)∥.

520

Then d1 is a metric and X1(G) with this metric is complete. Denote by X1
+(G) ⊂
X1(G) the set of all vector ﬁelds f satisfying f (p) /∈Tp(∂G), ∀p ∈∂G, and
ϕt(p) ∈G, ∀p ∈∂G, ∀t > 0, sufﬁciently small (ϕt(·) is the ﬂow of f ). X1
+(G)
is an open subset of X1(G).
The point p ∈M is called a wandering point of the dynamical {ϕt}t∈R on (M, g)
if there exists a neighborhood U of p and a number t0 > 0 such that

|t|>t0
ϕt(U) ∩U = ∅.
The set of all non-wandering points of {ϕt}t∈R generated by the vector ﬁeld F is
denoted by NW(F).
One can show that if γ (p) is a bounded orbit of the dynamical system {ϕt}t∈R then
ω(p) ∪α(p) ⊂NW(F). This implies that if the dynamical system has a solution
ϕ(·)(p) such that γ+(p) or γ−(p) is bounded, then NW(F) is non-empty. It is also
well-known that any non-wandering set NW(F) is closed and invariant.
Pugh’s closing lemma [12] plays a crucial role in our global stability investigation:
Theorem A.4 Let X ∈{X1(M), X1
+(G)}, F ∈X, and p ∈NW(F), F(p) ̸= 0.
Then for an arbitrary neighborhood U of F in X there is a vector ﬁeld G ∈U
having a periodic orbit passing through p.
Suppose that M and N are n-dimensional Ck-manifolds, ϕ : M →M and ψ :
N →N are maps. These maps are called topologically conjugated (Cr-conjugated)
if there exists a homeomorphism h : M →N (a Cr-diffeomorphism h : M →N)
such that ϕ = h−1 ◦ψ ◦h.
Suppose now that F : M →T M and G : N →T N are vector ﬁelds, {ϕt}t∈R
and {ψt}t∈R are the associated ﬂows. The vector ﬁelds F and G (or their ﬂows) are
called Cr-equivalent with 0 ≤r ≤k (topologically equivalent for r = 0) if there
exists a Cr-diffeomorphism h : M →N (a homeomorphism for r = 0) which
transforms the orbits of {ϕt}t∈R into orbits of {ψt}t∈R preserving the orientation
of the orbits. If {ϕt}t∈R and {ψt}t∈R are Cr-equivalent (topologically equivalent)
over h : M →N and if h(ϕt(p)) = ψt(h(p)), ∀p ∈M, ∀t ∈R, then {ϕt}t∈R
and {ψt}t∈R are called Cr-conjugated (topologically conjugated). Suppose that
ϕ ∈Diffr(M) and e ∈{ topologically conjugated, Cr-conjugated} is an equivalence
relation as deﬁned above.
The diffeomorphism ϕ is called e-stable if there exists a neighborhood U of ϕ in
Diffr(M) such that any ψ ∈U is e-equivalent to ϕ.
Suppose now that F : M →T M is a Cr-vector ﬁeld with associated ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R
and e ∈{ topologically equivalent, Cr-equivalent, topologically conjugated,
Cr-conjugated}.

Appendix A: Basic Facts from Manifold Theory
521
The vector ﬁeld F (respectively, the ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R ) is said to be e-stable if there
exists a neighborhood U of F in Xr(M) such that any G ∈U ise-equivalent to F. In
case if e ore means “topologically equivalent” the e-ore-stability is called structural
stability. Recall that a topological space X has the Baire property, or is a Baire space,
if every countable intersection of open dense sets in X is itself dense in X. Baire’s the-
orem says that any complete metric space has the Baire property. As noted above, the
metricspacesDiff0(M), Diff1(M), Diff0(G), Diff1(G), X0(G), X1(G), X0(M)and
X1(M) are complete. It follows that they are Baire spaces. We say that in these spaces
there is given a generic property, if such a property is satisﬁed for a set which contains
a countable intersection of open and dense sets, then such a set is called residual.
A.8
Parallel Transport, Geodesics and Exponential Map
Suppose that (M, g) is a Riemannian n-dimensional Ck-manifold and c : J →M
is a C1-curve. A continuous map X : J →T M given by t ∈J →X(t) ∈Tc(t)M
is called a vector ﬁeld along c.
The vector ﬁeld X : J →T M along c is said to be Cr-smooth if for any chart
x ∈A, the vector ﬁeld has a representation X(t) = ξ i(t)∂i(c(t)) with Cr-smooth
functions ξ i(·).
Let F : M →T M be a smooth vector ﬁeld and p ∈M be arbitrary. The covari-
ant derivative ∇F(p) : TpM →TpM in a chart x is given by
∇υ F(p) =
∂f k
∂xi ai + ai f j(p)Γ k
i j(p)

∂k(p) ,
where F = f i∂i and υ = ai∂i. Since the vector ﬁeld X can be written in this chart
as xi := (x ◦c)i, we get with ξ k(t) := f k(c(t)) for the vector υ = ˙c (t)
∇˙cX(t) = [˙ξ k(t) + ˙xi(t) ξ j(t) Γ k
i j(c (t))] ∂k (c(t)), t ∈J
s.t. c (t) ∈D(x).
The vector ﬁeld X : J →T M is parallel along c if ∇˙cX(t) = 0 on J . Locally in
a chart x this means that
˙ξ k(t) + ˙xi(t) ξ j(t) Γ k
i j(c (t)) = 0 .
Using the existence and uniqueness theorem for linear differential equations, one
can show that for a given smooth curve c : J →M, arbitrary t0 ∈J and arbitrary
υ ∈Tc(t0)M, there exists exactly one vector ﬁeld Xυ(t) which is parallel along c and
for which Xυ(t0) = υ holds.
Suppose c : J →M is a given smooth curve, t0 < t1 are values in J . The map
τ(c)|t1
t0 : Tc(t0)M →Tc(t1)M which is deﬁned by υ ∈Tc(t0)M →Xυ(t1) ∈Tc(t1)M,
where Xυ(·) is the unique vector ﬁeld parallel c with Xυ(t0) = υ, is called parallel

522
Appendix A: Basic Facts from Manifold Theory
transport along c from c(t0) into c(t1). One can show that the map τ(c)|t1
t0 is linear
and is an isomorphism.
The smooth curve c : J →M on the Riemannian Ck-manifold (M, g) is called
a geodesic if the vector ﬁeld ˙c is parallel along c, i.e. if ∇˙c ˙c (t) = 0 on J . In a
chart x : D(x) →R(x) we have with xk(t) := (x ◦c)k(t) and X(t) = ˙xi(t) ∂i(c (t))
the representation ∇˙c ˙c (t) =
	
¨xk(t) + ˙xi(t) ˙x j(t) Γ k
i j(c(t))

∂k(c(t)). It follows that
c is a geodesic iff in any chart x ¨xk + Γ k
i j ˙xi ˙x j = 0 . From the local existence and
uniqueness theorem for ODE’s, it follows that for arbitrary p ∈M and υ ∈TpM,
there exists an ε > 0 and a unique geodesic c : (−ε, ε) →M with c (0) = p and
˙c (0) = υ.
The parallel transport remains the scalar product in the following sense: Suppose
c : J →Misasmoothcurve,t0 ∈J isarbitraryand X, Y : J →Maretwovector
ﬁelds which are parallel along c. Then g(X(t), Y(t)) = g(X(t0), Y(t0)) , ∀t ∈J .
Suppose (M, g) is a Riemannian n-dimensional Ck-manifold (k ≥3). One can show
that for any p ∈M and any υ ∈TpM there exists a unique geodesic ϕ(·, p, υ),
deﬁned for |t| < ε and satisfying ϕ(0, p, υ) = p, ˙ϕ(0, p, υ) = υ.
The map (t, p, υ) →ϕ(t, p, υ) is Ck−2-differentiable for υ ∈TpM with sufﬁ-
ciently small |υ|.
The exponential map υ →expp υ := ϕ(1, p, υ) is Ck−2 in a neighborhood of
0 ∈TpM. If V is a sufﬁciently small open neighborhood of 0 then the map expp :
V →expp V is a Ck−2-diffeomorphism.
Suppose that p ∈M is arbitrary and ε > 0 is so small that expp is a Ck−2-
diffeomorphism on Bε(0p) ⊂TpM. Then for any υ ∈Bε(0p), the curve t →
c (t) := expp(tυ), t ∈[0, 1], deﬁnes the geodesic c on M with c (0) = p and
˙c (0) = υ.

Curvature and Torsion
Suppose (M, g) is a Riemannian Ck(k ≥2)-manifold of dimension n and let F and
H be Cr-vector ﬁelds (2 ≤r ≤k −1) on M. The Lie bracket of F and H is that
Cr−1-vector ﬁeld [F, H] on M, whose components in a chart x : D(x) →R(x) are
deﬁned as
[F, H]|D(x) = [ f i∂ih j −hi∂i f j] ∂j ,
where
F|D(x) = f i∂i
and
H|D(x) = h j∂j .
One can show that this deﬁnition is correct, i.e. does not depend on the chart x.
Let F, G and H be Cr-vector ﬁelds on the Riemannian Ck-manifold (M, g) of
dimension n (k ≥3, 2 ≤r ≤k −1), let λ and μ be numbers and ρ, γ : M →R
be Cr-functions. Then we have:
1. [F, G] = −[G, F] ; [F, F] = 0 ;
2. [λF + μG, H] = λ [F, H] + μ
[G, H] ;

Suppose that for the above manifold (M, g) and vector ﬁelds F, G, H we have
k ≥4 and 3 ≤r ≤k −1. The curvature tensor ﬁeld is the Cr−2-smooth tensor ﬁeld
R of type (1, 3) given by
R (F, G)H = ∇F∇G H −∇G∇F H −∇[F,G]H ,
the torsion tensor ﬁeld is the Cr−1-smooth tensor ﬁeld of type (1, 2) given by
T (F, G) = ∇FG −∇G F −[F, G].
By Bianchi’s ﬁrst identity we have
R (F, G)H + R (G, H)F + R (H, F)G = 0 .
Suppose p ∈M and f, g, h ∈TpM with f = F(p) , g = G(p) and h = H(p)

Fiber Bundles and Distributions
A Ck-ﬁber bundle is given by a surjective submersion π : P →M, where P and M
are Ck-manifolds. The submersion is assumed to be locally trivial, i.e. there exists
a manifold N such that, for each point p ∈M, there exists a neighborhood U of p
and a Ck-diffeomorphism h : π−1(U) →U × N with π ◦h−1
|U = idU. We say that
P is the bundle space, M is the base space, π is the projection, h is a bundle chart
and N is the typical ﬁber. For any p ∈M the set π−1(p) is the ﬁber over p.
A Ck-vector bundle is a Ck-ﬁber bundle whose ﬁbers have a vector space structure.
Suppose that M is a Ck-manifold (k ≥2) of dimension n and T M = 
p∈M TpM
is the tangent bundle, which has the canonical structure of a Ck−1-manifold of dimen-
sion 2 n. Then the natural projection π : T M →M deﬁnes a Ck−1-vector bundle.
The typical ﬁber in this case is an n-dimensional vector space V. Similarly, if T ∗M
denotes the cotangent space of M, the projection π : T ∗M →M is also a Ck−1-
vector bundle.
A Ck-vector bundle π : P →M with an n-dimensional Ck-manifold M as base
space and an m-dimensional vector space V as typical ﬁber has the canonical structure
of an (n + m)-dimensional Ck-manifold. A Cr-section, 1 ≤r ≤k, in a Ck-vector
bundle π : P →M is a Cr-map s : M →P such that π ◦s = idM. Suppose that
Er(P) is the set of all Cr-sections of π : P →M. For the given vector bundle, the
base manifold M can be realized as a submanifold of P, identifying any point p ∈M
with the zero vector in π−1(p). We denote this submanifold by Z(P) and call it zero
section of P. A subset P′ ⊂P of a vector bundle π : P →M is a subbundle if there
exists a subspace W ⊂V and for any b ∈P′ a bundle chart h : π−1(U) →U × V
with b ∈U and such that h(π−1(U) ∩P′) = U × (W × {0}).

Suppose that l, m ∈N0 are arbitrary. Then T l

p∈M T l
k (Pp) is the tensor
bundle of type (l, m) on M with respect to P. A Cr-tensor ﬁeld of type (l, m) is
a Cr-section of T l
k (P). A bundle metric g of smoothness Cr(1 ≤r ≤k) on a Ck-
vector bundle π : P →M is a Cr-smooth symmetric tensor ﬁeld g ∈Er(T 0

for which g|p(·, ·) at any p ∈M is a positive deﬁnite bilinear form on Pp.
Suppose π : P →M is a Ck+1-vector bundle and consider the Ck-vector bundle
d π : T P →TM. The vertical subbundle for the vector bundle π : P →M is the
subbundle of T P deﬁned by V T P = ker(dπ). A vector ﬁeld on P is called vertical
if it takes only values in V T P. In a similar manner one can deﬁne the horizontal
subbundle of T ∗P which is that subbundle HT ∗P of T ∗P that annihilates V P. A
one-form on P will be called horizontal if it takes values in HT ∗P.
Denote by πP : T P →P the natural projection. A connection on P is a map C :
P × T M →T P for which (πP, dπ) ◦C = idP×T M and C p : Pp × TpM →T P
is for any p ∈M bilinear. A connection on the vector bundle deﬁnes the horizontal
subbundle HT P of T P which is the image of P × T M under C and which is
complementary to V T P, i.e. T P = V T P ⊕HT P. A C1-curve γ : J →P is
called horizontal if ˙γ (t) ∈HTγ (t)P for any t ∈J . Suppose c : J →M is C1-
curve in the base manifold M. The horizontal lift of c is the horizontal C1-curvec :
J →P with π ◦c = c. For a C1-curve c : J →M, t0 ∈J , and υ ∈π−1(c(t0)),
there exists exactly one horizontal liftcυ : J →P satisfyingcυ(t0) = υ. For a given
C1-map c : J →M and arbitrary times t0, t1 ∈J , t0 ≤t1, we call the map τ c(t1)
c(t0) :
Pc(t0) →Pc(t1) which associates to any vector υ ∈Pc(t0) the vector cυ(t1) ∈Pc(t1)
parallel transport of υ along c from c(t0) to c(t1). The connection is called metric if
the parallel transport along curves is isometric with respect to the bundle metric.
Suppose that s ∈Er(P), 1 ≤r ≤k, is a Cr-section of the Ck-vector bundle π :

with c(0) = p and ˙c(0) = w. It can be shown that this deﬁnition does not depend on
the choice of c if the initial conditions are satisﬁed.
The covariant derivative deﬁnes a map ∇: Er(P) × Er(T M) →Er−1(P).
The absolute derivative of a smooth section X : J →P along the C1-curve c :

called parallel along the curve c if ∇˙c(t)X(t) = 0, t ∈J .
Suppose the connection is metric w.r.t. the metric g and (·, ·) is the induced

A distribution D on M is a subbundle of T M, i.e. the union over all p ∈M
of linear subspaces of TpM. The rank of D at p, i.e. of D(p), is the dimen-
sion of the subspaces in D(p). Given for 1 ≤r < k a family of Cr-vector ﬁelds
V := {F1, . . . , Fl} on M, we can deﬁne a distribution of rank l and smoothness
Cr by DV(p) = span{F1(p), . . . , Fl(p)}, p ∈M. The distribution DV is said to be
involutive if for any pairs F, G ∈V and any p ∈M we have for their Lie bracket
the inclusion [F, G](p) ∈D(p). An integral manifold Z of DV is a differentiable
submanifold of M such that TpZ ⊂D(p) for all p ∈M. The distribution DV is
said to be integrable if, for all p ∈M, there exists an integral manifold with the
same dimension as the rank of D. This submanifold of M is called the maximal
integral manifold of D. Frobenius’ theorem states that involutivity and integrability
of distributions are locally equivalent notions.
Suppose that (M, g) is a Ck-manifold (k ≥3) of dimension n ≥2 and F =
{Lα|α ∈A} is a partition of M in disjunct and connected subsets which are called
leaves. F is called a Ck-foliation of M of dimension m if for any point p ∈M
there exists a chart x : D(x) →R(x) of the manifold such that R(x) = U1 × U2,
where U1 ⊂Rm and U2 ⊂Rn−m are open connected sets, and for any leaf L ∈F
we have D(x) ∩L = x−1(U1 × υ0) with some υ0 ∈U2. The number n −m is the
codimension of the foliation. Any leaf L is a connected immersion of dimension m.
A Ck-foliation F on M deﬁnes through T F = 
α∈A

p∈Lα TpLα a subbundle of
T M which is called the tangent bundle of the foliation F. With T ⊥F we denote
the normal bundle of the foliation. Thus the tangent bundle of M can be written as
T M = T F ⊕T ⊥F.
Given a ﬁber bundle π : E →M with principal ﬁber F we can deﬁne a product
bundle by taking the total space E = M × F with the regular projection π2 : M ×
F →F. The ﬁber π−1
2 (p) = {p} × F has a unique natural homeomorphism which
is (p, w) →w for (p, w) ∈M × F. Let us construct two ﬁber bundles over S1. Start
with the product bundle Dn−1 × [0, 1] over [0, 1] (n ≥2), and glue Dn−1 × {0} to
Dn−1 × {1} by some homeomorphism. The result is a Dn−1-bundle over S1. One can
show that there are two classes of such Dn−1-bundles, one is orientable and one is
not. The total space of the orientable Dn−1-bundle over S1 is the ﬁbered solid torus,
the total space of the non-orientable Dn−1-bundle over S1 is the ﬁbered Klein bottle.
The boundary of the ﬁbered solid Klein bottle is the regular Klein bottle. The total
space of the non-orientable D1-bundle over S1 is the Möbius band. Similarly one
can deﬁne the ﬁbered Klein bottle as total space of the non-orientable Rn−1-bundle
over S1. Note that the trivial ﬁbered solid n-torus over S1 is the set Dn−1 × S1 or
Rn−1 × S1.

Totally Ordered Sets
A set X is called partially ordered if for certain pairs x, y of its elements there is
deﬁned an order relation x ≤y satisfying the following conditions:
(i) x ≤x;
(ii) x ≤y, y ≤x ⇒x = y;
(iii) x ≤y, y ≤z ⇒x ≤z.
A partially ordered set (X, ≤) is said to be totally ordered if either x ≤y or y ≤x,
for any x, y ∈X. Any bijective map f of a totally ordered set (X, ≤) onto a totally
ordered set (Y, ≤) is called similarity, if x ≤x′ in X implies f (x) ≤f (x′), for any
x, x′ ∈X. Two totally ordered sets (X, ≤) and (Y, ≤) are similar or have the same
ordering number if there exists a similarity which maps X onto Y. The ordering
numbers of inﬁnite totally ordered sets are called transﬁnite numbers. Suppose A
is a set of transﬁnite numbers. A transﬁnite number ξ such that ξ = limx∈A x is
called limit transﬁnite number (see [1]). All natural numbers and the number zero
are called transﬁnite numbers of the ﬁrst class. The transﬁnite numbers of countable
totally ordered sets are called transﬁnite numbers of the second class.
The following Baire-Hausdorff theorem [1] holds.
Theorem B.1 Suppose that X is a topological space with a countable base and
there is a totally ordered decreasing system of closed sets of this space, ordered by
all transﬁnite numbers of the ﬁrst and second classes:
S0 ⊃S1 ⊃S2 ⊃· · · ⊃Sα ⊃· · · .
(B.1)
Then there exists a transﬁnite number α such that all sets of (B.1), beginning with
some ordering number α, coincide:
Sα = Sα+1 = Sα+2 = · · · .

Recurrence and Hyperbolicity in Dynamical Systems
Let {ϕt}t∈T be a dynamical system with T ∈{R, Z} on the n-dimensional Riemannian
Ck-manifold (M, g). The orbit γ (p) is called positively recurrent if p ∈ω(p) and
negatively recurrent if p ∈α(p).
Kneser [7] showed in 1924 that a continuous ﬂow on the regular Klein bottle K2
without equilibrium points has at least one periodic orbit. Later it was shown by
Markley [10] that every positively or negatively recurrent orbit of a continuous ﬂow
on the regular Klein bottle K2 is periodic.
For any non-empty, closed, bounded and invariant set K ⊂M there exists at
least one minimal set in K (Proposition 1.4, Chap. 1). It follows that if γ+(p) (resp.
γ−(p)) is bounded then ω(p) (resp. α(p)) contains at least one minimal set. The
next theorem (Lemma of Schwartz, [14]) is the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem for
2-dimensional manifolds.
Theorem B.2 Suppose that M is a 2-dimensional manifold of class C2, {ϕt}t∈R is
a C2-smooth ﬂow on M and N ⊂M is a non-empty compact minimal set of the
ﬂow. Then the following three cases are possible.
(i) N is an equilibrium;
(ii) N is a periodic orbit;
(iii) N = M .
In the case (iii) M is compact and the ﬂow doesn’t have equilibrium points. One
can show in this case that M is homeomorphic either with the torus or with the
regular Klein bottle. But on the regular Klein bottle without equilibrium states for
{ϕt}t∈R, this dynamical system always has, by Kneser’s theorem a cycle. Thus this
case is impossible.
Suppose that {ϕt}t∈T is a C1-smooth dynamical system with T ∈{N0, Z, R+, R}
on the open set U of the Riemannian n-dimensional Ck-manifold (M, g)(k ≥3).
Assume that K ⊂U is an arbitrary set and E ⊂TKM is a subbundle. The subbundle
E is called dϕt-equivariant if K is ϕt-invariant and dpϕtEp = Eϕt p for any p ∈K
and any t ∈T. Let {ϕt}t∈T be a C1-smooth dynamical system with T ∈{R, Z} on the
n-dimensional Riemannian Ck-manifold (M, g). A compact set K ⊂M is called
partially hyperbolic for {ϕt}t∈T if K is ϕt-invariant and there exist numbers C >
0, λ > 0 and a splitting TKM = Es ⊕Eu ⊕Ec of the tangent bundle TKM into the
dϕt-invariant subbundles Es, Eu and Ec such that
∥dϕt
|Es∥≤Cλt
and ∥dϕ−t
|Eu∥≤Cλt
are satisﬁed for all t > 0, t ∈T.
If Ec belongs to the zero-section, the set K is called a hyperbolic set of {ϕt}t∈T. The
dynamical system {ϕt}t∈T on (M, g) is called partially hyperbolic (resp. hyperbolic)
if M is compact and is a partially hyperbolic (resp. hyperbolic) set of {ϕt}t∈T.
For a time-discrete hyperbolic system {ϕt}t∈Z, the C1-diffeomorphism ϕ1 : M →
M is called Anosov diffeomorphism. A hyperbolic ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R generated by F is
said to be an Anosov ﬂow [2] if dim Ec
p = 1 and F(p) ∈Ec
p, ∀p ∈M.

A C1-diffeomorphism ϕ : M →M is said to be an Axiom A diffeomorphism
[15] and the associated dynamical system {ϕt}t∈Z is an Axiom A system if the set
NW(ϕ) of non-wandering points is hyperbolic and the set of periodic points of ϕ is
dense in NW(ϕ).
A ﬂow {ϕt}t∈R is called Axiom A system if the non-wandering set NW(ϕ) is
hyperbolic and can be written as Z1 ∪Z2, where Z1 and Z2 are disjunct compact
invariant sets, Z1 contains a ﬁnite number of equilibrium points and in Z2 the periodic
orbits of {ϕt}t∈R are dense.

Degree Theory
Suppose γ is a simple curve in R2, i.e. a compact, without intersection and oriented
curve, given by the continuous and injective parameterization c : [a, b] →R2. Sup-
pose also that f is a continuous vector ﬁeld along γ that does not vanish along this
curve. The winding number or rotation of f along γ is an integer number w( f, γ )
which shows how many times the closed continuous path f : γ →R2 \ {0} rotates
in the mathematically positive direction around the origin in R2.
In the case when γ is an oriented C1-regular curve, f = ( f 1, f 2) is a non-
vanishing C1-vector ﬁeld along γ and α is a 1-form given on R2 \ {0} by α =

This formula can be used to generalize the winding number to the n-dimensional
space Rn. Suppose for this that Ω ⊂Rn is a bounded domain with C1-boundary
∂Ω and f = ( f 1, . . . , f n) is a non-vanishing C1-vector ﬁeld along ∂Ω. Then the
winding number w( f, ∂Ω) of f along ∂Ω is deﬁned by the integral (Kronecker’s

It can be shown that if Ω ⊂Rn is a bounded domain with C2-boundary ∂Ω and
f is a C1-vector ﬁeld on Ω with 0 /∈f (∂Ω) then
w( f, ∂Ω) = deg( f, Ω, 0) .

Under the consideration of formula (B.4) the relation (B.5) leads to the deﬁnition

A measure of the non-injectivity of a given map is the multiplicity function.
Suppose that M1 and M2 are two arbitrary sets and φ : M1 →M2 is a map. The
multiplicity function N(φ, K, u) of φ with respect to a set K ⊂M1 at the point
u ∈M2, is the cardinality of the set {υ ∈K|φ(υ) = u}. Suppose that φ : M →M
is a C1-map on the orientable n-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold (M, g).
It can be shown that if the determinant det (duφ) of the tangent map duφ is positive
on M then the multiplicity function of φ with respect to K at u coincides with the
local degree of φ at u.
In the following, we need the extension theorem of Dugundij [4].
Theorem B.3 Suppose that (X, d) is a metric space, (Y, ∥· ∥) is a Banach space,

set φ−1(q) ⊂D is discrete and therefore ﬁnite since D is compact. Because the

satisfy ∂2 = ∂◦∂= 0. The space of k-cycles is given by
Zk(K, G) = {c ∈Ck(K, G)|∂c = 0} ,
the space of k-boundaries is deﬁned by
Bk(K, G) = {∂c | c ∈Ck+1(KG)} .
Then the factor-group Hk(K, G) = Zk(K, G)/Bk(K, G) deﬁnes the k-th homology
group of K with coefﬁcients from G. For various triangulations h : |K| →M of a
given manifold, the associated homology groups Hk(K, G) are independent of the
concrete triangulation. Thus we can introduce the k-th homology group Hk(M, G)
of the manifold M with coefﬁcients from G.
Let us now consider G = Z and let us introduce the abbreviations
Bk(M) ≡Bk(M, Z),
Ck(M) ≡Ck(M, Z) and
Hk(M) ≡Hk(M, Z).
It can be shown that Hk(M) is a ﬁnitely generated abelian group, i.e. there exists a
ﬁnite number of elements h1, . . . , h p such that any element in Hk(M) may be written
as h = p
i=1 aihi with ai ∈Z and none of the elements h1, . . . , h p can be written as
such a sum of the remaining ones. The number p is the rank of the group. It is well-
known that any group Hk(M) has only generators of ﬁnite or inﬁnite order and can
be written as the direct sum of one-dimensional free subgroups and one-dimensional
subgroups of ﬁnite order, i.e.
Hk(M) = Z ⊕Z ⊕· · · ⊕



bk(M)−times
Z ⊕F1 ⊕· · · ⊕Fmk(M) .
The number bk(M) of free generators is the k-th Betti-number, the orders
r1, . . . ,rmk(M) of the remaining generators are the torsion coefﬁcients. Let us recall
that there are many similarities between chains and differential forms. A closed
differential form ω on M, i.e. such that dω = 0, is also called cocycle . An exact
differential form ω, i.e. such that there exists another differential form Θ with ω =
dΘ, is also called coboundary. Let Zk(M) denote the set of all cocycles with the
natural structure of an additive group over Z and let Bk(M) denote the subgroup
of Zk(M) consisting of all coboundaries of degree k. The factor-group H k(M) =

Appendix B: Miscellaneous Facts
533
Zk(M)/Bk(M) is the k-th cohomology group of M. By the de Rham theorem this
group is isomorphic to the dual of Hk(M).
For a given triangulation h : |K| →M of the manifold M we put
χ =
dim M

k=0
(−1)k card {σ| σ

One can show that χ does not depend on the triangulation of M and this deﬁnes
a topological invariant χ(M) which is called Euler characteristic of M.
The Euler-Poincaré formula says that on a compact orientable manifold M
χ(M) =
dim M

k=0
(−1)kbk(M) ,
where bk(M) are the k-th Betti-numbers of M. The Euler characteristic χ(M) of a
compact orientable manifold is also equal to the sum of the indicies of the (isolated)
zeros of any smooth vector ﬁeld f on M (Poincaré Hopf theorem).

Simple δ-Linked Parameterized m-Boundaries
Let us introduce the following concept [8].
Suppose (X, ∥· ∥) is a Banach space and m is a non-negative integer. A parame-
terized m-boundary (resp. parameterized (m + 1)-surface) in D ⊂X is a continuous
function Φ whose domain of deﬁnition is ∂U (resp. U), the boundary (resp. closure)
of a non-empty bounded open connected set U ⊂Rm+1 and whose range is in D.
A parameterized m-boundary Φ is the parameterized boundary of a parameterized
(m + 1)-surface Ψ , denoted Φ = ∂Ψ, if Φ = Ψ|∂U , the restriction of Ψ to ∂U. A
parameterized m-boundary is simple if it is one-to-one on its domain. The trace of a
parameterized m-boundary (resp. (m + 1)-surface) Φ is the set Φ(∂U) (resp. Φ(U)).
The extension theorem of Dugundji (Theorem B.3) implies that any parameterized m-
boundary Φ : ∂U →X is the parameterized boundary of a parameterized (m + 1)-
surface in the convex hull co Φ(∂U).
A sequence of parameterized (m + 1)-surfaces Φk : Uk →X is compact (resp.
bounded) if the closure of the set 
k Φk(Uk) is compact (resp. bounded). If u0 ∈
Rm+1, δ > 0, let Nδ(u0) = {u ∈Rm+1 |u −u0| < δ}, where | · | is the Euclidean
norm in Rm+1.
Let N0, N−, N+ denote the sets of points u ∈N1(0), u = (u1, . . . , um, um+1),
for which um+1 = 0, um+1 < 0, um+1 > 0, respectively.
A point u ∈∂U is an ordinary point of ∂U if there exists a neighborhood W of
u0 and a homeomorphism h : N1(0) →W such that h(N0) = W ∩∂U, h (N−) =
W ∩(Rm+1 \ U) and h(N+) = W ∩U.

A parameterized m-boundary Φ has an m-dimensional tangent space X1 at x0 =
Φ(u0) if u0 is an ordinary point of ∂U (realized by a homeomorphism h), Φ0h|N0 is
Frechét differentiable at 0 and the range X1 of the derivative L = (Φ0h|,υ0)(0) has
dimension m. Let X1 be an m-dimensional subspace of X. Then there exists a basis
{e1, . . . , em} of X1 (called the Auerbach basis), such that ∥ei∥= 1 and 1 = ∥qi∥1 =
sup{∥qix∥
 x ∈X1, ∥x∥= 1}, where qix is the ith coordinate of x referred to this
basis, i = 1, . . . , m.
The Hahn-Banach is used to extend the linear functionals qi to X with ∥qi∥= 1
and to deﬁne the projections P1, P2 by P1 = m
i=1 eiqi, P2 = I −P1. It follows that
P2
j = Pj and X = X1 ⊕X2, where X j = PjX, j = 1, 2. The projections satisfy
∥P1∥≤m, ∥P2∥≤m + 1. Deﬁne a norm ∥· ∥1 on X by
∥x∥1 = (∥q1x∥2 + · · · + ∥qmx∥2 + ∥P2x∥2)1/2.
Then
(m + 1)−1/2∥x∥≤∥x∥1 ≤(m + (m + 1)2)1/2∥x∥
so that ∥· ∥and ∥· ∥1 are equivalent norms and the equivalence is uniform with
respect to the choice of X1. If δ > 0 and x0 ∈X, let B1

∂U, a parameterized m-boundary 
Φ : ∂U →X, x0 = 
Φ(u0) and an m-dimensional

deﬁned by ∥· ∥1.)
Remark B.1 (a) Note that the perturbation 
Φ of Φ satisfying (D1) – (D3) need not
be a simple parameterized boundary.
(b) A simple parameterized m-boundary without points where a tangent space exists,
may be δ-linked. The Koch curve (Sect. 3.2.3, Chap.3) is δ-linked.
Let us state the following three propositions, due to M. Y. Li and Muldowney [8].
Proposition B.1 When m > 0 is an integer, a simple parameterized m-boundary Φ
is δ-linked for some δ > 0 if it has an m-dimensional tangent space X1 at some point
x0 = Φ(u0), u0 ∈∂U.
Proposition B.2 Let Φ and Ψ be two ordinary parameterized m-boundaries which
have the same domain and range. Then if Φ is δ-linked, so also is Ψ .

Geometric Measure Theory
All of the following basic facts from geometric measure theory can be found in
[5, 11]. Suppose m ≥0 is a positive integer. A set Z ⊂Rn is m-rectiﬁable if Z
is μH(·, m) ≡μm
H(·)-measurable, μH(Z, m) < ∞, and there exist m-dimensional
C1-submanifolds {Mi}∞
i=1 in Rn such that μH(Z \ ∞
i=1 Mi, m) = 0. For μH(·, m)
- a.a x ∈Z, the tangent spaces at x to distinct Mi containing x are equal. Let TxZ
be this tangent space where it exists. Both the standard inner product and the duality
pairing for all spaces is denoted by ⟨·, ·⟩.
The space of all C∞-differential m-forms in Rn with compact support is Dm. For
β ∈Dm we deﬁne
∥β∥:= sup{⟨β, ξ⟩| ξ ∈Λm(Rn), |ξ| = 1, ξ simple m-vector}.
The dual space is denoted by Dm and is called the space of m-dimensional currents.
Suppose θ is a multiplicity function on Z, i.e. an μH(·, m)-measurable function θ
with domain Z and range a subset of the positive integers, such that

Z θdμm
H < ∞.
Suppose also that there is an orientation ξ, i.e. a μm
H-measurable function ξ with
domain Z such that for μm
H - a.a. x ∈Z the orientation ξ(x) is one of the two
simple m-vectors associated with TxZ, i.e. for μm
H - a.a. x ∈Z we have ξ(x) =
τ1(x) ∧· · · ∧τm(x), where τ1(x), . . . , τm(x) is an orthonormal basis in TxZ.
A linear operator on C∞m-forms β given by
T (β) :=

Z
θ(x) < ξ(x), β(x) > dμm
H
is called m-dimensional rectiﬁable current. The set of all m-dimensional rectiﬁable
currents forms an abelian group which is denoted by Rm.
For each T ∈Rm, m ≥1, we deﬁne the boundary operator ∂T given by Stokes
formula
∂T (β) = T (dβ) , β an arbitrary C∞(m −1)-form .

536
Appendix B: Miscellaneous Facts
It is not necessarily true that ∂T ∈Rm−1. The abelian group of m-dimensional
integral currents is given by
Im := {T ∈Rm | ∂T ∈Rm−1} , m = 1, 2, . . . ,
I0 := R0 .
We enlarge Rm to the abelian group of m-dimensional integral ﬂat chains, or m-
chains, deﬁned by
Fm := {R + ∂S | R ∈Rm, S ∈Rm+1} .
The operator ∂is extendible to a group homomorphism ∂: Fm →Fm−1 if m ≥1.
For T ∈Rm we deﬁne the mass of T by
M(T ) :=

Z
θdμm
H .
One can extend the deﬁnition of M to Dm. For T ∈Dm we deﬁne
M(T ) := sup{T (β) | ∥β∥≤1 , β ∈Dm}.
Then one has
Rm = Fm ∩{T | M(T ) < ∞} ,
Im = Rm ∩{T | M(∂T ) < ∞} .
One now deﬁnes the integral ﬂat “norm” on Fm by
F(T ) := inf{M(R) + M(S) | T = R + ∂S, R ∈Rm, T ∈Rm+1}
and the integral ﬂat metric by F (T1, T2) := F (T1 −T2) .
If T ∈Fm, m ≥1, and ∂T = 0 (or if T ∈F0), we say that T is an m-dimensional
integral ﬂat cycle or m-cycle.
If m ≥1, it follows by a cone construction that T = ∂S for some S ∈Fm+1.
If T ∈Fm and T = ∂S forsome S ∈Fm+1,wesay T isanm-dimensionalintegral
ﬂat boundary, or m-boundary. Thus if m ≥1, every m-cycle is an m-boundary. Let
Em denote the space of all currents T ∈Dm with compact support.
If T ∈Em and φ : Rn →Rn is a C∞-map, then one deﬁnes the push-forward
φ∗T ∈Dm by
(φ∗T )(β) = T (φ∗β) , ∀β ∈Dm .
Here φ∗β denotes the pullback of the k-form β (see Sect. A.3). In case T corresponds
to some oriented manifold Z, then φ∗T corresponds to the oriented image φ(Z). The
push-forward φ∗T has the following important properties:

Appendix B: Miscellaneous Facts
537
(a) φ∗∂T = ∂φ∗T ;
(b) supp φ∗T ⊂φ(supp T ).
The normal currents are given by
Nm := {T ∈Em | M(T ) + M(∂T ) < ∞} .
For T ∈Dm we deﬁne the ﬂat norm F of currents by
F(T ) := min{M(A) + M(B) | T = A + ∂B ,
A ∈Em, B ∈Em+1} .
The set Fm := F-closure of Nm in Em deﬁnes the real ﬂat chains. It is shown in [5]
that Fm ⊂Fm.
As a corollary from a theorem in 4.1.20 [5] we have the following:
Theorem B.5 If T ∈Fm(Rn) and μH(supp T, m) = 0, then T = 0.
