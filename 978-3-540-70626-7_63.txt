Ensembles in Quantum Mechanics
Leslie E. Ballentine
The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description
of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which immediately
become unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles
of systems and not to individual systems.
– Albert Einstein (1879–1955) [1], p. 671.
This quotation is perhaps the most famous statement of the ensemble interpreta-
tion of quantum mechanics. The role of the ensemble in quantum mechanics ranges
from innocuous to profound, and even controversial.
The innocuous role of the ensemble stems from the fact that quantum mechan-
ics does not predict the actual events, but only the probabilities of the various
possible outcomes ( probability in quantum mechanics) of the various possible
events. In order to compare the predictions of quantum mechanics with experiment,
one must prepare a  state and measure some dynamical variable, and repeat this
preparation–measurementsequence many times. The relative frequencies of the var-
ious outcomes in this ensemble of results can then be compared with the theoretical
probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics. Thus it is natural to say that quantum
mechanics describes the statistics of an ensemble of similarly prepared systems.
Here, as in classical statistical mechanics, one should not confuse the ensemble
of systems with an assembly of systems into a composite. For example, if the system
is a single particle, then the ensemble is a conceptual set of replicas of it, each in its
own environment, whereas the assembly would be a many-particle system. The role
of the ensemble is to enable statistical analysis; its members do not interact with or
inﬂuence each other.
The more signiﬁcant role of the ensemble interpretation is exempliﬁed by
 Schr¨odinger’s cat paradox [2], which involves an unstable atom, a cat, and a
mechanism that releases a poison to kill the cat when the atom decays. The initial
state vector of the system, |φ1⟩|live⟩, describes an atom in an excited state and a
live cat. The ﬁnal state vector, after the atom has decayed and the cat is dead, will

be |φ0⟩|dead⟩. At an intermediate time equal to one half-life of the unstable atomic
state, the normalized state vector will be
|⟩= (|φ1⟩|live⟩+ |φ0⟩|dead⟩)/√2
(1)
Now how are we to interpret the state vector |⟩, which apparently describes a
coherent superposition of macroscopically distinct components, namely a live cat
and a dead cat? It makes no sense as a realistic description of an individual system.
The paradox is not changed at all if we include the effect of the environment, i.e.
 decoherence. In place of (1), we will have
|⟩= (|φ1⟩|live⟩|e1⟩+ |φ0⟩|dead⟩|e2⟩)/√2
(2)
where |e1⟩and |e2⟩are states of the environment. But (2) is still a coherent superpo-
sition of macroscopically distinct components; indeed, the paradox is even worse,
since we now have a superposition of two environmental states, which is an even
more macroscopic superposition than that in (1).
But if the state vector is regarded only as the generator of probability distributions
for the  observables of an ensemble of similarly prepared systems, then |⟩makes
perfectly good sense. If the experiment is repeated many times, in one half of the
cases the cat will be found to be alive, and in the other half of the cases it will be
found to be dead [4,5].
The limitations of the ensemble interpretation can be expressed by the question,
“Is that all there is?” The world is made up of individual systems and individual
events, not ensembles and probabilities, so the description of the world by quan-
tum mechanics seems somewhat incomplete. An extention of the theory to describe
individual events, not merely their probabilities, would, indeed, be desirable, but
it would appear to require new fundamental developments that go beyond those
of present day quantum mechanics. A broad review of ensemble interpretations is
given in [6].

Entanglement

Consider two proper quantum systems S1 and S2 with  Hilbert spaces H1 and H2,
respectively. If S1 and S2 are independently prepared in the pure states ϕ1 ∈H1 and
ϕ2 ∈H2, then the compound system S1 + S2 is correctly described in the tensor-
product Hilbert space H1 ⊗H2 by the product state ψ0 = ϕ1 ⊗ϕ2. In this case, the
state ψ0(S1 + S2) determines uniquely the states ϕ1 and ϕ2 of subsystems S1 and
S2, respectively.
In the general case, the state ψ(S1 +S2) of the compound system cannot be writ-
ten as a product of states referring to S1 and S2. (A state of this general kind can be
prepared by a convenient interaction between the two systems for a limited period of
time, as in a scattering process of S1 and S2.) However, even if the state ψ(S1 + S2)
(after the interaction) cannot be written as a product, it can be decomposed with re-
spect to two orthonormal systems in H1 and H2 into a weighted sum of products. In
particular, for any pure state ψ(S1 +S2) there exist orthonormal systems ξ(1)i ∈H1
and η(2)k ∈H2 that allow for a biorthogonal decomposition [1,2]
ψ(S1 + S2) =

with one summation index i and complex numbers ci. In this state, the two systems
are called entangled provided that the sum consists of more than one term. The en-
tanglement [3] of S1 and S2 means in particular, that the compound state ψ(S1 + S2)
does not provide deﬁnite information about pure states of S1 and S2. We can only
say, that the probability pn for ﬁnding S1 in the state ξ(1)n(S1) and S2 in the state
η(2)n(S2) is given by the value pn = |cn|2.
