Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis is an interdisciplinary book series which aims to 
face the questions of emergence, individuation and becoming of forms from several 
different points of view: those of pure and applied mathematics, of computational 
algorithms, of biology, of neurophysiology, of cognitive and social structures. The 
set of questions above concerns all the manifestations of Being, all the manifesta-
tions of Life. At the heart of contemporary embryogenesis lies an essential question: 
How can form emerge from the constant, chaotic ﬂow? How can a sequence of purely 
informational elements — an a-signifying combination of chemical substances orga-
nized in the DNA molecule — evolve into the highly complex and structured forms 
of the living organism? A similar question can be asked when we deal with the 
morphogenesis of vision in neural systems and with the creation of evolving synthetic 
images, since digital technology makes possible the simulation of emergent processes 
both of living bodies and of visual forms. Finally the very idea that abstract struc-
tures of meaning could be captured in terms of morphodynamic evolution opens 
the door to new models of semiolinguistics, semiotic morphodynamics, and cogni-
tive grammars. An entire heritage of ideas and concepts has to be reconsidered in 
order to face new and challenging problems: the theoretical framework opened by 
Goethe with the introduction of the word “Morphogenesis” is developed by D’Arcy 
Thompson in “On Growth and Form”, it is reorganized with new theoretical insights 
by the classical structuralism of Levi-Strauss and formalized by the dynamical struc-
turalism of René Thom. The introduction of the post-structuralists ideas of individ-
uation (in Gilbert Simondon and Gilles Deleuze) and plasticity of structures builds a 
bridge to contemporary problems of morphogenesis at a physical, biological, social 
and transindividual level. The objective of this book series is to provide suitable 
theoretical and practical tools for describing evolutionary phenomena at the level 
of Free boundary problems in Mathematics, Embryogenesis, Image Evolution in 
Visual Perception, Visual Models of Morphogenesis, Neuromathematics, Autonomy 
and Self-Organization, Morphogenetic Emergence and Individuation, Theoretical 
Biology, Cognitive Morphodynamics, Cities Evolution, Semiotics, Subjectivation 
processes, Social movements as well as new frontiers of Aesthetics. To submit a

In memory of René Thom (1923–2002) to the 
centenary of his birth 
To my grandson Ludwig Vito Wildgen, born 
on the 29th of September 2021

Preface 
The central aim of this research is to give a morphogenetic, dynamic view of human 
communication, culture, and symbolic media. The underlying theoretical innovation 
originated in the work of René Thom (1923–2002) and Hermann Haken (1927–). 
The philosophical background refers to the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms by Ernst 
Cassirer (1874–1945). His focus was on language, myth, and science. 
In the present book, the starting line is deﬁned by a morphogenetic perspective, 
mainly on human communication and culture’s evolution and further development. 
A second and signiﬁcant focus is on visual communication, music, and religion 
(myth), i.e., on the “symbolic forms” (Cassirer) beyond language. The term “mor-
phogenesis” has more precisely the meaning given by René Thom (1923–2002) in 
his publications on “Morphogenesis and Structural Stability” (1972) and “Semio-
physics” (1988). Finally, the applications of Synergetics in the Humanities (cf. Haken 
and Stadler 1989, Kelso 1995, and Haken 1996) and the notions of “self-organization” 
and cooperation or rivalry between subsystems enlarge the scope of our analysis. 
Visual art from the Paleolithic to modernity may stand for visual communica-
tion. The present book focuses on studies of classical painting and sculpture (e.g., 
Leonardo da Vinci, William Turner, and Henry Moore) and modern art (e.g., the 
sculptures of William Moore and Joseph Beuys and the paintings of Jackson Pollock). 
Musical morphogenesis embraces classical music (from J. S. Bach to Arnold Schön-
berg), songs, and political songwriting. In the case of religion, the myths of pre-
literary and pre-industrial societies show essential gradients of self-organization, 
mainly in the re-assembly of traditions. Classical polytheistic and monotheistic 
religions also demonstrate language and logic’s effect as guiding symbolic forms. 
Finally, signiﬁcant trends can be analyzed in the case of Christianism. 
The book selects and elaborates topics dealt by the author in his trilogy published 
in German: (titles of these books translated into English) 2013, “Visual Semiotics. 
The Unfolding of the Visible. From Cave Art to Modern Towns”, 1918, “Musical 
Semiotics. Musical Signs, Cognition, and Language”; 2021 “Myth and Religion. 
Semiotics of the Transcendent”.

Preface
Some representative analyses are developed further and exemplify the use and 
the scientiﬁc relevance of the morphogenetic paradigm issued by René Thom and 
Hermann Haken. A new cultural and symbolic philosophy concept emerges going 
beyond Peirce and Cassirer and based on principles developed in the natural sciences.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
Abstract Morphogenesis, the general topic of the Lecture Notes, has been applied 
to language and other cultural media (symbolic forms). An essential input came from 
René Thom, the French mathematician and Fields Medal winner. The chapter starts 
by considering the role of morphogenesis in the life sciences and the transition from 
biological to semiotic morphogenesis (semiogenesis). Further elaborations consider 
the impact of individuation, the speciﬁcation of morphogenesis for human popula-
tions and individuals, the role of traditions and reﬂection (ratiogenesis), and, even-
tually, the relation between morphogenesis (in the sense of Thom 1972) and “semio-
physics” (exposed in Thom [19] Esquisse d’une sémiophysique: physique aristotéli-
enne et théorie des catastrophes. Interéditions, Paris [English translation: Semio-
physics. A Sketch. Addison-Wesley, Boston 1990], 1988 [20]). Parallel to Thom’s 
proposals, the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of Synergetics, introduced by Herman Haken, 
has widened the consideration by enlarging the ﬁeld to stochastic dynamics, the anal-
ysis of cooperative effects between systems, and the complexities of self-organization 
in nature and culture. 
1.1 
Morphogenesis and the Science of Life 
The most basic biology question concerns the transition from inert matter to life. In 
this transition, physical laws do not lose their relevance; on the contrary, they are 
necessary to explain the origin of life. Nevertheless, essential features change dramat-
ically. Physical laws are reversible, and phase transitions are punctual. In contrast, 
the transitions and bifurcations in the domain of life are irreversible (until death), 
processes in the organism depend on the ecology of the system, negative entropy 
(information gain) is possible,1 and different levels of organization (with speciﬁc 
laws) are eminent. Minor causes and chance effects may decide upon the further

Introduction
history of a group or even a species (Blount [3] calls this effect “contingency”), 
convergent evolutions lead to similarities between species, which are not the result 
of an identical genetic outﬁt or parallel causal lines. With the advent of theoret-
ical biology, mathematical technics were inspired by their applications in physics, 
although the underlying mechanisms are different. These differences ask for a modi-
ﬁcation of the formal tools applied in physics. Although, in the beginning, biological 
systems (unicellular organisms) may still be accessible to a physicochemical analysis, 
complex biological systems, speciﬁcally the building of life-forms and their differ-
entiation, ask for an independent treatment that respects the differences mentioned 
above and considers holistic phenomena, e.g., the telic character of wholes and the 
back-propagation from the whole to its parts. This aspect had already been clear to 
Kant at the end of the eighteenth century (“organisms are wholes”). Philosophers of 
the nineteenth century (e.g., Hegel) made clear that the aspect of genesis, of devel-
opment, is at the heart of biological reasoning. The morphogenetic phenomena are, 
therefore, crucial for biology. However, are they also vital to psychology, sociology, 
and semiotics? 
In psychology and the cognitive sciences, we must consider a new transition, 
which at ﬁrst sight seems to be inside biology. Living beings interact with the 
ecology and have their inner stability (metabolism). The brain, characteristic of 
higher animals, is part of the whole organism. Nevertheless, the brain’s functions in 
perception, communication, and interaction open a ﬁeld of processes beyond purely 
biological morphogenesis. Are phenomena like thinking, (self)-consciousness, and 
symbolic behavior still accessible via the mechanisms found in the organization of 
organic life? Because of continuity in evolution, we should assume that on one side 
basic types of organization in cognitive, communicative, and semiotic systems are 
shared with the organization of primary biotic systems; on the other side, new features 
can emerge, establishing a kind of autonomy of symbolic systems. In the context of 
our topic, we must ask: Can we still describe morphogenesis and the stability and 
regulation of forms of behavior in the framework of theoretical biology? It seems 
plausible to conjecture a transition similar to the one considered when the physical 
frame changed into a biological one. As in the former case, some general features 
will remain relevant, but new phenomena, regularities, and laws should appear. 
1.1.1 
The Rise of Theoretical Biology and the Role 
of Morphogenesis 
The theoretical treatment of morphogenesis, speciﬁcally on mathematical back-
ground, goes back to D’Arcy Thompson (1860–1948), who in 1917 published his 
book On Growth and Form. Signiﬁcant advances were due to Conrad Waddington 
(1905–1975) and his work in the thirties on “developmental epigenetics" (cf. his 
book: Organizers & Genes, 1940). René Thom (1923–2002) carried this thread on. 
He used mathematical results of differential topology (catastrophe theory) to map

the processes of biological morphogenesis and expanded this view to the human and 
social sciences (cf. Thom [19]). In the following decades, this program was further 
substantiated and diversiﬁed, mainly using the quickly evolving ﬁeld of dynamic 
systems theory (catastrophes, chaos, fractals, stochastic dynamics). Most of the 
proponents of this endeavor came from mathematics (Thom and Zeeman), physics 
(Haken), and chemistry (Prigogine). In the eighties, the concepts of autopoiesis 
and self-organization advocated by the neuroscientist Humberto Maturana (*1928) 
attracted many biologists and psychologists (cf. Maturana and Varela [12]). 
Meanwhile, signiﬁcant results and theoretical advances have been integrated 
into the ﬁeld of the corresponding natural sciences (from physics to the neuro-
sciences). However, applications to the human and social sciences are still contro-
versial and ask for a better empirical and theoretical foundation. If Johann Wolfgang 
Goethe (1749–1832) considered an embracing discipline “Morphologie überhaupt” 
(universal morphology) ranging from biology to the arts (literature, visual art, music), 
this dream seems still to be far off. Intuitively, the creation of forms, their classiﬁca-
tion, their historical evolution, and the artist’s creative act ask for concepts similar to 
those found in the analysis of living beings. Beyond intuitive creativity, art concerns 
primarily the emotion, the will, and the rationality of a human being in the creation 
and appraisal of symbolic forms. 
1.1.2 
Darwin Revisited 
The ﬁrst effect of Darwinism, responsible for its triumph after almost a century of 
debates, was that its theory rendered God as an explanatory force of evolution super-
ﬂuous. As such, it continued the trend established by Condillac, Rousseau, and Herder 
in the eighteenth century and announced the triumph of physical science at the end 
of the nineteenth century. Its second impulse was to introduce a space of possible 
evolutions (variation in Darwin’s terms) out of which selection can choose. This 
space became more concrete with modern genetics, the explanation of mutations, 
and the deciphering of DNA. In addition, statistical models could model the inter-
action of mutation and selection. These advances transformed Darwin’s incomplete 
explanation into Neo-Darwinism (the New Synthesis). 
A further transformation of Darwinism occurred in the late seventies of the twen-
tieth century and led to new theories called EVO-DEVO (ecological evolutionary 
developmental biology). In this context, it was possible to revitalize fundamental 
insights of nineteenth-century biology, i.e., deep homologies that link biological 
entities separated by hundreds of millions of years, for instance, fruit ﬂies, mice, 
and humans. The key to these analogies is ancient genes that have been conserved 
for millions of years and can control the homology of basic morphological “plans” 
despite huge morphological differences. Homeotic genes, i.e., genes that control 
the identity and correct order of bodily segments, constitute the “homeobox”, i.e., 
the set of gene segments shared by the homeotic genes (cf. Gehring [7]: Chap. 3). 
Many of the homologies mentioned by René Thom in 1972 between patterns in

Introduction
plants and animals on the one side and humans and human behavior on the other can 
be related to such ancient genetic programs (morphogens, instructed signals).2 Our 
discussion cannot go into the details of Evo–Devo-theories or experimental research 
in biochemistry. Still, this speciﬁcation of Darwinian theory demonstrates that the 
morphological intuitions of René Thom and many predecessors (e.g., Goethe or St. 
Hilaire) are worth further consideration and do not contradict modern evolutionary 
biology. 
In the case of symbolic forms, this means that although experimental research in 
genetics cannot bridge the gap between unity and diversity in fruit ﬂies and univer-
sality/diversity in language and other symbolic forms, it makes sense to consider 
two different types of dynamics. First, the dynamics of self-organization start from 
a homogeneous base situation and arrive at a highly organized end situation. Mathe-
matically, these dynamics refer to Turing’s models in the early ﬁfties of the twentieth 
century.3 They may explain the rapid growth of diversity but cannot explain the 
long-lasting stability of species and families of species and their identity. Second, 
the existence of a developmental genetic toolkit that enables the conservation of 
old patterns in the midst of growing diversity (cf. Hidalgo et al. [9]). It remains still 
unclear what the nature of such a toolkit could be that controls the unity and diversity 
of cultural universals versus the divergence of cultural forms throughout the world. In 
Chap. 2, we shall argue that the organization of perceptual organs (in humans, partic-
ularly sight and hearing) constitutes a kind of “homeobox” for unfolding symbolic 
forms. A further ancient base is the dynamics of motion and locomotion, as the main 
Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6 will show. 
Signiﬁcant problems with evolutionary explanations remain. First, selection 
concerns the phenotype (the individual animal, its survival, and the creation of 
progeny); the transmission of the results to the genotype is less direct than presumed 
(epigenetic and global physiological factors interfere).4 Second, the survival and 
expansion of new variants (based on unpredictable mutations) depend on many 
ecological and social contexts. Third, some effects may be self-referential as new 
variants change the survival conditions. This effect can occur inside the organism 
if variants trigger structural reorganizations or outside if moving and very active 
animals change their environment.5 This effect became clear with humans and, most
2 Mechanistic models of morphogenesis insist on the locality of all mechanisms and a reduction 
to physical and chemical action and reaction based on molecules. As our perspective is clearly 
“high-level”, we do not adopt such a strictly molecular and local strategy. The Nobel prize winner 
Christiane Nüsslein-Vollhard shows in her book, Nüsslein-Vollhard (2004: 82–101), that basic 
processes of segmentation and spatial organization encountered in very different classes of animals 
establish gradients whose interaction and conﬂict are constitutive for morphogenesis. 
3 “Alan Turing ﬁrst formulated this theory in 1952 with a ‘reaction–diffusion’ model describing 
the interaction of an activator and long-range diffusing inhibitor. Most work has since assumed a 
molecular basis for self-organization.” Bailleul et al. ([2]: Sect. 1.3). 
4 Darwin still accepted a kind of Lamarckian mechanism which transforms individual cognitive and 
behavioral advances into features of a species. 
5 See also the notion of “ecomorph” introduced by Williams: a “species with the same structural 
habitat/niche, not necessarily close phyletically, but similar in morphology and behavior.” (cited in 
Blount [3].

dramatically, since the industrial revolution, which led to a new stage, the so-called 
Anthropocene, a world profoundly changed by man (Anthropos). These shortcomings 
of Darwinism have further consequences for evolutionary psychology, linguistics, 
and the evolution of human culture because complicated self-organization and self-
referential effects occur in highly complex and large systems. Simple Darwinian 
mechanisms are more transparent and more decisive at the level of molecular 
evolution (cf. Eigen and Schuster [6]). 
In the case of language evolution (cf. Wildgen 2004a), three relatively rapid and 
vital changes occurred: 
(a) 
The transition from ape-like behavior in australopithecines (3–4 million years 
(=my) before present (=BP))6 to Homo ergaster/erectus (ca. two my BP). It 
doubled cranial capacity, introduced tool use, and led to larger social groups. 
(b) The transition from descendants of Homo ergaster in Africa to Homo sapiens 
ﬁnished ca. 300,000 years ago. After a bottleneck around 120,000 BP, this 
species expanded in and out of Africa (since 100,000, mainly after 70,000 BP). It 
seems plausible to explain these and further changes by applying morphogenetic 
principles.7 In the case of language, this process led from the (hypothetical) 
protolanguage of Homo erectus to the human language capacity shared by all 
humans. 
(c) 
Sophisticated cultural innovations appeared with the Neolithic revolution 
(beginning after the last ice age, i.e., approximately 10,000 BP), the ﬁrst large 
and highly organized civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and the emer-
gence of writing. However, it is not plausible that evolutionary processes affected 
essential human capacities in this period because the Darwinian mutation and 
selection mechanisms ask for more extensive time intervals due to mutation rates 
and the necessary time for the distribution and dominance of selected variants. 
The communicative and social capacities of the evolving species (cf. Sect. 1.1.3) 
expand biological morphogenesis to semiogenesis. One must also consider individ-
uation, which operates in the transition from genotype, the genetic type, to pheno-
type, the individual body/mind. Individuation contributes to the constitution of social 
systems like clans, regional associations of social groups, ethnical wholes, and large 
societies. These dynamics are responsible for the vast diversity of human cultures 
and symbolic forms. This process is called ecological and social morphogenesis; 
it concerns the unfolding of behavioral and cognitive “forms” (Greek morph´¯e) in  
individuals and societies, their selection, and stabilization in an ecological context.
6 BP = before present. “present” refers to a conference in 1955 where this category was created. In 
the case of historical time, the classical labels BC = before Christ, and AC = after Christ are used. 
Roughly, BC = BP – 2000. 
7 The last surviving non-human species was the late Neanderthal man in Europe (extinct between 
37,000 and 30,000 BP), i.e., before the maximum of the last ice age (25,000 to 20,000 BP).

Introduction
1.1.3 
From Biological Morphogenesis to Semiogenesis 
In epigenetic processes and embryology, a structural framing occurs, which limits 
new genetic variants and the bodily expression of genes, i.e., it shapes the space of 
possible forms. In the social, cultural, and ecological domain, other morphogenetic 
processes occur, called semiogenetic, insofar as the perception and mental reaction 
to the environment are a requisite of form-giving and form-transmission (imitation 
and learning). Cultural transmission replaces or goes parallel to genetic transfer. 
Semiogenesis redeﬁnes the relevant environment, changes the selective forces, and 
thus indirectly inﬂuences the genetic outﬁt and its epigenetic expression. Two highly 
relevant transitions after hominization had a major impact on the further development 
of human symbolic media and languages: 
(a) 
The culture of painted caves in the late Paleolithic is documented between 37,000 
and 16,000 BP. A rich corpus of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and abstract 
(quasi-writing) symbols illustrate this period, which extended over Central and 
Eastern Europe under the conditions of the last ice age (recently, cave paintings 
were discovered in Borneo). 
(b) The new technologies of farming and cattle breeding led to many cultural inno-
vations, e.g., writing and urbanization. It produced the ﬁrst large-scale societies 
in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus valley (beginning around 5,000 BP = 
3,000 BC). 
A recent transition to a so-called “morphogenic society” in late modernity is 
advocated by Archer [1]. Earlier societies were relatively static, as negative feedback 
to social changes dominated and evinced rapid changes. In morphogenic societies, 
changes receive positive feedback. At ﬁrst, innovations in social relations are realized 
in sub-cultures and social niches. After this experimental stage, some are rapidly 
generalized to the whole society or even globally. In a morphogenic society, symbolic 
media will also change rapidly and either lose their relevance and the number of 
adherents or be diffused exponentially. At the same time, the rhythm of changes 
increases, followed by a quick change of values. In encounters with people from 
other groups or newly built networks, the values and norms become unpredictable. 
1.2 
The Impact of Individuation 
The processes of survival and selection operate on the level of the individual. This 
is clearest in Darwin’s favorite example: sexual selection (cf. Darwin [4]). Sexual 
partners either reject or accept one another, and the transfer of genes is blocked or 
enabled. This scenario presupposes individuation and a context (time, place, and the 
presence of other agents like rivals). 
An individual is deﬁned by the natural limits of life (i.e., birth and death) and the 
forces that sustain his/her life. If life is endangered, appropriate mechanisms exist

1.3 Tradigenetic and Ratiogenetic Processes
7
to recover, repair damages, and avoid death. In this perspective, individuation has 
an implicit ﬁnality: survival under danger and risk. A tribe or family group may 
disappear if its reproduction rate is too low. Thus, in small and separated groups, a 
scenario characteristic of Neanderthals, the loss of some younger females may lead 
the group to extinction; if this often occurs and becomes a trend, the species may be 
extinct after several generations (particularly, if the overall population is small; it is 
assumed that the population of Neanderthals did not exceed 10,000 individuals). 
By these dynamics, individuation can drive the evolutionary process, i.e., avoid 
or allow the extinction of a group or, ultimately, a species. Suppose individuals and 
groups of one species or subspecies share the ecology with others. In that case, their 
success may enhance the extinction of the other species if the mixture is genetically or 
behaviorally excluded or rare (dangerous).8 Individuation is also the bridge for either 
biological or cultural innovation. For biological innovation, the individual that shows 
new features due to some biological change must ﬁrst survive in the environment of 
individuals without this change and then produce progeny. These conditions decide 
whether the new capacities of the individual survive and ﬁnally change the character-
istics of a group or even a species. In the case of cultural innovation, other individuals 
must perceive it as positive: imitate/learn it to become part of the cultural heritage. 
In each case, the change must be perceived and evaluated to trigger a new behavior, 
i.e., the effect relies on semiotic (sign-related) factors. Symbolic behavior evolution 
is enhanced by individuation processes and by the propagation and socialization of 
semiotic innovations. 
1.3 
Tradigenetic and Ratiogenetic Processes 
One can distinguish tradigenetic and ratiogenetic processes (cf. Tembrock [17]). In 
the ﬁrst case, sociocultural values, standards, and techniques are transmitted and 
conserved within a social group (e.g., a family, tribe, or a geographically connected 
set of tribes); the members of a group establish a tradition as a system of habits. 
Ratiogenetic processes enhance such events by distinguishing individuals or profes-
sional groups for their directive function. These persons may be older adults, priests 
(shamans), elected chiefs, etc. They incorporate the group’s heritage (in their life 
memory) and can plan and direct speciﬁc innovations or dramatic changes that deeply 
inﬂuence a population’s fate. Thus, the ﬁgure of Moses, who led the people of Israel 
out of Egypt, the prophets and founders of religion, or signiﬁcant statesmen (see 
Alexander, Augustus in antiquity) and their helpers (a small subpart of the society) 
can rationally move a given society into a speciﬁc direction. Since the industrial
8 Thus, Neanderthal individuals seem to have mixed with individuals of the early Homo sapiens 
when they met around 100,000 BP. However, a mixture in Europe after 40,000 BP, when 
Homo sapiens migrated massively into Europe, was rare. It did not prevent the extinction of the 
Neanderthals (possibly their offspring had health problems and rarely survived).

Introduction
revolution (England 1760–1840), the French revolution (1799), and socialism (nine-
teenth century), technological, scientiﬁc, and political innovations have inﬂuenced 
the development of humanity.9 Insofar as ratiogenetic processes refer to individual 
minds, i.e., the imagination and planning of individuals, they are part of individu-
ation. In the transmission process, the traces of this origin may disappear because 
many people have contributed to its elaboration, transmission, and the establishment 
of new standards. 
1.4 
Morphogenesis and Mathematics for the Human 
Sciences 
Christopher Zeeman and his disciples (mainly Ian Stewart and Tim Poston) issued a 
large number of applications ranging from models of heart rhythm, the behavior of 
dogs (ﬂight/attack), and the dynamics of the human brain to social behavior (cf. 
Zeeman [25] and Poston and Stewart [16]). Consequently, qualitative dynamics 
(already sketched by Poincaré, 1874–1912) became an object of general concern. 
American and Russian mathematicians (Mather, Milnor, Smale, and Arnold) have 
further advanced the theory of singularities. Still, Thom’s primary aim was to unfold 
further the morphogenetic intuitions he had described in his book Stabilité struc-
turelle et morphogenèse [19]. Thom’s and Zeeman’s proposals have shown that the 
mathematical results in singularity theory and dynamic systems theory not only have 
deep historical sources in mathematics but are very promising for future research. 
Thom took up Aristotle’s idea of “genus” (type) and introduced the terms “prég-
nance” and “saillance” which make up the heart of his “Semiophysics” (cf. Petitot 
[14], Thom [20], and Wildgen [22]). Similar developments were at the heart of 
Hermann Haken’s “Synergetics” and the models of the neuroscientist Kelso [10], 
Dynamic patterns: the self-organization of brain and behavior). The shared strategy 
of these groups may be called “From matter to mind”, i.e., the theories of the human 
mind are systematically founded on biological and physical systems theory and focus 
on the continuity between the natural and the human sciences. 
René Thom, the famous mathematician, was indirectly attracted by semiotics and 
linguistics. At a point in his career as a mathematician, appointed to the Institute 
of Advanced Research in the Sciences (Institut des Hautes Études Scientiﬁques) 
in Paris, he began to reﬂect on the role of topology and topological dynamics 
in the ﬁelds of biology and the human sciences. In the sixties, Thom exchanged 
letters with C. H. Waddington, who wrote a preface to Thom’s book Stabilité struc-
turelle et Morphogenèse [19]. In the foreword to its translation into English (1975), 
Waddington refers to his book Organizers and Genes (cf. Waddington [21] and [22]), 
where he formulated some fundamental questions of theoretical biology, to which
9 They even impacted the earth’s climatic and geological state (cf. the exploitation of resources 
deep underground and in the oceans and changes in the chemical structure of the atmosphere and 
climate). 

1.4 Morphogenesis and Mathematics for the Human Sciences
9
Thom found a mathematical answer. One problem with biology is that it cannot be 
explicitly founded on the laws of physics or chemistry. Such a foundation would ask 
for systems with millions or billions of factors. A topological treatment allows us 
to formulate the general contours of an explanation. In a later phase (prepared by 
articles after 1978), Thom wrote his book Esquisse d’une sémiophysique (Sketch of 
a Semiophysics, published in 1988 and translated to English in 1989). Thom tried to 
link the forces of the morphogenesis of meaning (semiogenesis) to primary magni-
tudes known from physics, i.e., gravitation and radiation (light). These universal 
ﬁelds embed the living beings and govern their environment (ecology). They are 
naturally the background of all perceptual and motor processes. In perception, light 
is at the basis of our visual perception; gravitation underlies human and animal motor 
processes and the sensation of pressure and weight; the ear registers sound waves, 
and the diffusion of chemical substances evokes reactions of our taste and smell 
organs.10 
As the dynamics of such ﬁelds (e.g., light) have been the topics of physics since 
Newton and wave dynamics the subject of speciﬁc mathematical treatments since 
Maxwell, it was apparent for Thom to postulate a particular ﬁeld registered and 
ﬁltered by our sensory organs. He called it “saillance”. The psychophysical ﬁeld 
selects these effects as the most informative. Thom’s program was to extract as 
much systematic content as possible from the analogy between physical and percep-
tual ﬁelds. Perception is the primary stratum of semiosis, and any perceptually based 
symbolic structure elaborates it. Although this strategy from physics to semiotics 
allows for the transfer of many mathematical techniques, there remains a large gap 
between psychophysics (the level of perception) and linguistics (or cultural semi-
otics). The term “prégnance” had to ﬁll this gap and explain the transition from 
perceptual reactions to symbolic forms (culture).11 
The dichotomy introduced by Thom has a precursor in Aristotelian philosophy. 
The corresponding notions for this duality are dynamis (δ´vναμις) or energeia 
(™νšργεια) versus morphe (μoρϕ´η) and typos (τ ´vπoς). Moreover, Thom refers 
explicitly to several modern scientiﬁc currents which contain a similar dichotomy: 
1. In Pavlov’s experiments, dogs salivate if presented with meat and “learn” the 
conditioned reﬂex of an associated bell (which evokes similar reactions). Here, 
the concept is used implicitly; the meat and the bell are “salient”. The meat is 
“pregnant” by the biological constitution of the dog, whose body shows a set of 
automatic reactions, which are thus the content of the presented sign “meat”. The
10 After World War II, digital computers began to dominate the ﬁeld of models in the life sciences 
and supplanted analog models. This trend is currently reversed as the digital models approach 
complexity limits. Analog models that use the resources of natural resources in physics, chemistry, 
and biology come to the fore. Cf. Dillavou [5]. 
11 In linguistics, many responses to Thom’s proposals were either simple repetitions or purely 
meta-theoretical. However, Thom’s ideas were rather meant as stimulation for further research 
(comparable to his conjecture of a classiﬁcation of unfolding dynamical systems that led to the 
mathematically elaborated classiﬁcation theorem of singularity theory). After a phase of vague 
acceptance, theoretical linguists returned to the ﬂeshpots of structuralism and its phenomenological 
epistemology. Cf. the comments on catastrophe theory in Piotrowski and Visetti ([15]: 25f).

Introduction
associated sign “bell ringing” inherits the meaning of the sign “meat”, and clas-
sical stimulus–response theory postulates that all meanings follow by stimulus 
conditioning from basic reﬂexes (elaborated by “operant conditioning,” which 
starts from chance reactions, reinforced by success). 
2. Konrad Lorenz observed the process called “Prägung” (imprinting) in birds (e.g., 
geese). During a short period after they leave the egg, many birds select rather 
unspeciﬁc stimuli in their environment and quickly elaborate on them to form 
basic concepts like that of a “mother bird”. Thus, if Lorenz quickly uttered 
sounds and the freshly hatched goose registered his presence, he ﬁlled the slot 
of a “mother goose”. As soon as this concept was established, he remained the 
prototype of a “mother goose” for them. Lorenz generalized this observation 
and postulated so-called “super releasers”, i.e., very primitive schemata which 
only ask for minimal perceptual and neural control. They may even ﬁt better into 
abstract molds than biologically real entities. In the process of “Prägung”, a rich 
semantic system is developed which could not have been coded genetically. 
3. Another biologist, Jakob von Uexküll, proposed a similar concept of “Bedeu-
tungswelt” (meaningful universe). His theoretical biology inﬂuenced Cassirer’s 
philosophy of symbolic forms when they were both lecturing in Hamburg. For 
Uexküll, every animal creates its own “Bedeutungswelt”, which depends ﬁrst on 
its windows of perception and then on its vital needs. Thus, a tick reacts percep-
tually to the concentration of butyric acid, typical of warm-blooded animals. The 
tick drops if this stimulus is received and eventually enters the animal’s fur. This 
minimal semiotic system guarantees survival as the tick feeds on the animal’s 
blood. 
4. In psychology, Gibson elaborated the concepts of “prägnante Gestalt” and 
“Valenz” of his teacher Koffka and called it affordance. Any object or process 
in our environment may have affordances; thus, a chair allows for sitting, a bed 
for sleeping, etc. Therefore, the whole ecology is meaningful regarding possible 
actions or events it will enable. As some activities are more frequent or have 
more value for survival than others, the concept of affordance allows for grades. 
Maximal affordance would then correspond to “Prägnanz”. 
5. Cassirer generalized the perceptual/motoric “Prägnanz” to “symbolische Präg-
nanz” (symbolic pregnancy) as perception is the ﬁrst level of semiosis (=symbol 
creation) in his system. One of the criteria of good gestalt was meaningfulness in 
Gestalt psychology. For Cassirer, symbolic content is the precondition of accurate 
perception as elements of perceptual input have to be integrated into a system of 
perceptually based concepts created by the mind. The signs associated with these 
concepts allow the steady stream of consciousness to halt as soon as something 
stable catches our attention. 
6. The American psychologist David Hebb, whose work has become fundamental 
for modern neuropsychology (cf. Hebb-assemblies; i.e., networks of neurons with 
a similar function), discusses different types of instincts and two models. The 
ﬁrst model, called monogenetic, assumes one primary force ﬁeld of biological 
motivation, which then separates into various subﬁelds like hunger, thirst, sexual

1.4 Morphogenesis and Mathematics for the Human Sciences
11
desire, aggression, fear, intellectual curiosity, etc. The second assumes a topology 
of motivations with different centers (attractors); cf. Hebb ([8], pp. 246–247). 
7. William Stern proposed applying the concept of “Prägung” (imprinting) to 
language acquisition. He recognized a goal-oriented, internally controlled 
process in language acquisition. Thomae linked this idea with the more general 
discussion in ethnology and psychoanalysis (Thomae [18], p. 244). Freud’s 
theory of psycho-genital development assumes far-reaching consequences of 
fundamental processes in early childhood, which ﬁx speciﬁc personality traits 
for a person’s whole life. Thomae (ibid.) explains this effect via a kind of 
“canalization”, which directs all further developments. 
Summarizing this discussion which has occupied biologists and psychologists 
for more than one century,12 one can assume on the one side that all animals have 
speciﬁc windows to their ecology and on the other side that a small set of motivations 
or vital force ﬁelds exist. However, the list of relevant basic types remains an open 
question. René Thom presupposes the existence of such an essential and elementary 
set, which shares the feature of structural stability and is independent of speciﬁc 
material contexts. This basic set is subdivided into “salience” and “pregnancy”. 
To these rather general ideas already found in the discourse of the scientiﬁc 
community, Thom adds two new concepts:
• The salience effect in perception may be linked via psychophysical laws to the 
dynamics of objective ﬁelds in physics and chemistry; i.e., perception refers in 
its principles to laws in natural science. In Thom’s terms, there is an explanatory 
continuum between objective salience in physics and chemistry and subjective 
salience in cognition and semiosis.
• The topology of salient objects and events governs the ﬂow of pregnancies via a 
process called “diffusion de prégnance” (channeling of pregnancy). As in Lorenz’s 
case of “Prägung” (imprinting), the attractor landscape of pregnancy ﬁlls with 
actual or memorized salience effects. In this channeling, the multiple forms of 
(perceptual) salience are elaborated into rich and context-dependent ﬁelds of 
categorical perception and behavior. 
The self-organization of the differentiated pregnancy effects creates a system 
of meanings and, thus, the prerequisite for a lexicon of perceptual entities. The 
crucial step concerns the stability and complexity of repeated transfers in channeling 
pregnancy. The symbolic form is detached from the salient objects it designates, 
i.e., the reference to the sign object becomes independent from the time and place 
of the perception of the corresponding entity. This effect has two consequences: 
What triggers appetite or avoidance, for example, can be broken down into many 
aspects, in which the types of usefulness or survival relevance differ. For instance, the 
community can categorize ﬂora and fauna according to edibility, medicinal effects, 
and instrumental use. The rich encyclopedias for ﬂora and fauna in many collecting 
and hunting societies show the outcome of this multiple division of what is vital for an

ethnic group. Applied to visual art, the image culture of a community is particularly 
striking for the artists and their clients in this society and directs their particular 
attention. 
Thom’s hypotheses apply mathematical techniques and theorems to solve funda-
mental problems. Nevertheless, the psychophysical transition calls for applying the 
laws of physical dynamics, not only the mathematics used in this ﬁeld. The authors 
Turvey, Kugler, Kelso, and others (cf. Kelso [10]) have elaborated on this thought. For 
instance, the diffusion of pregnancy may correspond to ﬂuid dynamics and models 
of growth in space and time.

From Sensorial Capacities to Symbolic 
Forms (With Particular Reference 
to Odor and Color) 
Abstract Symbolic forms exist in the transition zone between sensation and commu-
nication, where perception and social cognition represent intermediate stages. In this 
transition zone, two primary symbolic forms near perception/sensation, i.e., odor and 
color, may serve as examples. In the ﬁrst step, we rehearse the sensualist position 
of Condillac and his followers; in the second step, we discuss fundamental issues in 
the perception of odors and colors and their communication. The notion of “sym-
bolic form” was introduced by Cassirer in the three volumes of his “Philosophy of 
Symbolic Forms” (1923–1929) and elaborated in further contributions on art, ethics, 
and politics. It will be a recurrent ﬁx point of our analysis. 
2.1 
Introduction: Sensation/Perception Versus 
Communication 
John Locke (1631–1704), Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (1714–1780), and Johann 
Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) have made clear that empirical sciences such as 
psychology, sociology, and anthropology1 are essential for the study of sensa-
tion/perception and communication. Different focuses concern human understanding 
(Locke), the relation between sensation and knowledge (Condillac), and the rise 
of human language and culture (Herder). In his “Traité des Sensations” (1754), 
Condillac presents the following thought experiment. A marble statue is succes-
sively endowed with sensual experience. Condillac begins with olfaction. The statue 
ﬁrst is what it smells; second, it distinguishes pleasant and unpleasant odors. Finally, 
comparison and memory select and stabilize the attention movement after the stim-
ulus’s reception. The difference is one of passivity if motivated by a stimulus and 
activity if motivated by memory (cf. Condillac [5]: 49). With the two principles of

political science, and Herder has made relevant contributions to anthropology in the late eighteenth 
century; cf. Condilac [4] and  Herder  [9].

pleasure/aversion and memory/comparison, Condillac develops a system of ideas 
based on olfaction. Similarly, he treats hearing, taste, and ﬁnally, sight, consisting of 
light and color. They all allow for positive/negative evaluation, memory/comparison, 
and thus order. The idea of extension in space, solidity, and identity establishes the 
shared limit. The integration into a world of apperceived objects is due to touch. 
The transition from sensibility to meaning/sense is possible, ﬁrst, due to our mind’s 
evaluative and abstractive capacity, and second, by integrating different types of 
experience. The “sensualistic” position of Condillac was a sound synthesis of ideas 
put forward in the discussions of modernity (sixteenth to eighteenth century) but 
underestimated the problem’s complexity. The composition of larger structures of 
words/imagistic units asks for large-scale organizational principles, which may be 
called the “architecture” of sense. Two directions can be distinguished: 
• Bottom-up: Sensations produced by our sense organs, triggered by external 
events, are stabilized, combined, and abstracted; they are memorized and come to 
conscience and thus make up the operations of thinking. This view has two critical 
zones: the psychophysical transition in the sensory organs (and correlated neural 
areas) and the combination and abstraction of perceptual “atoms” (produced in 
the ﬁrst transition). 
• Top-down: Any perception, memory, imagination, or combination of ideas presup-
poses the mode of thinking and thus incorporates principles and axioms of mental 
processing. The psychophysical contact zone immediately selects those data 
which ﬁt the cognitive processing (eliminating or forgetting everything else). 
• Self-referential: The thinking is shaped by the processing of sensual data. Piaget’s 
equilibrium of assimilation (top-down) and accommodation (bottom-up) clearly 
expresses this view, which was already contained in Locke’s and Condillac’s 
essays (1690 and 1746). Locke makes the ﬁrst and Condillac the decisive second 
move by including the problem of signs (words) in the following sequence: 
bold w bo ld o  b old r bol d d righ t ar row left parenthesis a sign of an right parenthesis bold i bold d bold e bold a right arrow left parenthesis a sign of right parenthesis bold e bold x bold t bold e bold r bold n bold a bold l bold e bold v bold e bold n bold t
Ideas are constructs at an intermediate level and not independent of words’ stabi-
lizing and organizing functions. Perception is itself a semiotic activity. Ernst Cassirer 
took up the eighteenth-century tradition (via his preferred authors Herder, Goethe, 
and Wilhelm von Humboldt). The “symbolic form” cuts the continuous ﬂow of sensa-
tions, categorizes it for memory, and thus links individual perception to collective 
structures like language, myth, art, technical skill, and ethics.2 
Despite these advances, the following signiﬁcant problems could not be solved: 
• How are meanings grounded in our (subconscious) sensory activities, which are 
adapted by evolution to selected features of our environment? The quality of 
this grounding (the “correct” selection, the stable transfer of relevant structural

2.2 The Perception and Communication of Odors

relations up to the highest levels of cognition) is crucial for the functional ﬁtness 
of the “animal symbolicum”, as humans are called by Cassirer [3].3 
• How can individual thinking (as representation) be economical and still represent 
external reality? 
Condillac considered perception as the ﬁrst semiotic level and signs as the neces-
sary stage to stabilize and organize memory and thinking. Thus a straight line of 
progress in complexity is proposed: 
• Psychophysical input to the senses. 
• Perception as the formation of signs for memory and imagination (dream). 
• Language as a stage of stabilization and necessary for the organization at a high 
cognitive level. 
• (Scientiﬁc) knowledge based on a linguistically organized universe of discourse. 
However, this line of progress is incomplete because a fundamental conﬂict exists 
between individual perception, action, and social communication. The ﬁrst ﬁeld has 
as its domain the individual brain (including the sensory organs) and the individual 
development (maturation and essential learning in a suitable environment). The 
second ﬁeld concerns the adaptation to a culturally transmitted system of linguistic 
rules, social beliefs, knowledge, social action, and perception. 
Although processes of learning and socialization link both domains, the funda-
mental mechanisms are different. The organization of the brain cannot be identiﬁed 
with the organization of a community, and communication underlies other condi-
tions of coding, transmission, functional adequacy, and economy than that operative 
in sensory organs and cortical centers of perception and motor planning. The differ-
ences become relevant in the use of olfaction and color and, thus, the contribution of 
sensory experience to unfolding symbolic forms. 
2.2 
The Perception and Communication of Odors 
Humans are constantly exposed to odors. They may react to them positively or nega-
tively, and olfactory impressions may control their attention and memory. Never-
theless, the level of communication is only reached if someone needs to speak to 
somebody, ask somebody, warn somebody, or order something concerning an odor. 
If both the speaker and the audience are exposed to the same smell, it is enough 
to call the audience’s attention to the scent and then perform a speech act refer-
ring to the (supposed) common perception. It is only if the odor is not present and 
must be represented that the problem of proper categorization and characterization
3 The grounding of symbolic forms in the physiology and the basic functions of perception is 
a candidate for the type of “instructional signaling” due to ancient genes in Evo-Devo-biology. 
Compared to symbolic forms, the physiologically established perceptual mechanisms are ancient, 
conserved patterns that may instruct the formation of symbolic patterns; cf. the remarks in Chap. 1 
(Darwin revisited).

occurs. It presupposes a stable system of meanings grounded in similar olfactory 
experiences. In a community where this demand does not occur frequently, commu-
nication regarding odors will be very insecure, unstable, poor, or meaningless. Thus, 
in the extreme case, every participant in a conversation may be perfectly able to 
perceive and, if necessary, distinguish a large set of odors but unable to communi-
cate these distinctions. The required ability concerns ﬁrst the stable grounding in 
personal perceptual experience, second efﬁcient coordination with the perceptual 
patterns in those with whom one wants to communicate, and third the invention 
and use of labels (lexical or periphrastic). Thus, it does not help to learn words for 
odors; even if these labels are individually grounded in olfactory experience, olfac-
tory communication remains vague because no coordination has been achieved. In 
expert communication, participants may accomplish such a grounding in training 
situations and by explicit conventions on language use. The experimental research 
in the perception and communication of odor in Dubois [8] makes clear that the 
grounding of odors is difﬁcult or even impossible because the chemical structure of 
odors is very complex, and behavioral reactions are very context-dependent. There 
is nothing that corresponds to the Munsell classiﬁcation of colors in the domain of 
odors. Dubois ([8]: 203f) writes: 
The stimulations originate in the organic molecules that trigger the speciﬁc olfactory recep-
tors of the nose, transferring olfactory information along neural pathways through the olfac-
tory bulb all the way to the brain, but with some speciﬁcity that makes this sense different 
from the others. Olfaction actually differs from the other more “noble” sensibilities: for 
one thing, the stimulations are described, not in physical but in chemical terms, as odorant 
molecules are mainly of organic nature. Furthermore, the neurophysiological description 
also insists on the speciﬁcity of the neural structures responsible for their coding. 
Condillac [5] mentioned the problem of organization of the ﬁeld of odors and the 
fact that it depends on the conditions and contexts of memorization.4 Thus, if one 
experiences a series of odors, e.g., of ﬂowers, coffee, and a nearby factory, a network 
that links and partially mixes these impressions and their evaluative reactions is 
created in memory. As a result, the neighborhood of odors in time and space, the 
amount of attention paid to them, and the pleasure or displeasure associated with 
them change from one individual to the next. Possibly, it is even more different for 
individuals living in other places and social and cultural contexts.5 Nevertheless, 
it seems possible for linguistic communities to use a set of commonly understood 
terms or expressions to communicate odor impressions. 
The range of linguistic devices to express the sensation and evaluation of odors 
has been underestimated in the scientiﬁc literature. Recent empirical studies (cf. the 
report in Dubois [8]) show that the linguistic repertoire used is much richer if the
4 Cf. Condillac [5]:81: “Prenons par exemple cette suite, jonquille, rose, violette. Dès que ces 
odeurs sont constamment liées dans cet ordre, une d’elles ne peut affecter son organe, qu’aussitôt 
la mémoire ne lui rappelle les autres dans le rapport où elles sont à l’odeur sentie”. 
5 Dubois [8]: comments the history of research in odors as follows: “In short, odors as smells, scents 
and perfumes are loaded with ambivalent symbolic investments that prevent exploring them as if 
such a historical and social context did not exist, in contrast with vision and audition considered by 
scientiﬁc research as ‘purest senses’ in both epistemological and moral terms (Cox [6], p. 1)”. 

2.3 The Perception and Communication of Colors
19
interviewers ask appropriate questions about the perception and communication of 
odors: 
To summarize, the (still largely incomplete) inventory of linguistic devices to account for 
‘odors’ as a sensory experience, when extended beyond the search for ‘basic terms’, reveals 
that olfaction is not a ‘mute’ sense. The lack of lexical items in olfaction depends on sociocul-
tural and linguistic constraints of ‘talking about odors’ rather than physiological constraints. 
A large diversity of morpho-syntactic, syntactic, and discursive devices is at work, differing 
from the (lexical) categories relevant to vision (Dubois [8], 229) 
Insofar as olfaction is, to a large degree, subconscious, the adaptation or social 
coordination is difﬁcult. Therefore, communication either uses the individual olfac-
tory perceptions and associated reactions only to a minimal extent, or olfactory 
perceptions are inaccessible to communication. Consequently, the perception of 
odors only approaches the threshold toward symbolic forms if coordinated with 
linguistic categorization and memory.6 Therefore, we shall not explicitly deal with 
odor under symbolic forms. 
2.3 
The Perception and Communication of Colors 
Condillac [5] argues that the perception of colors alone does not constitute colored 
places, situations, motions, or colored objects; it just forms a continuum of colored 
surfaces limiting one or the other. Our memory allows us to see two or three colors and 
journey from one color to the other. Nevertheless, the perception of colors contributes 
to an idea of extension, a space of colors. He also points to the difference between a 
naive observer of a painting and the painter. 
A painter and I see all the parts of the painting, but whereas he extricates them quickly, 
I have so many difﬁculties discovering them that I have the impression that I ﬁnd in any 
moment parts that I have not yet seen. (translation by the author of a passage in Condillac 
(1755/1821: 111).7 
The astonishing differentiation of human color vision does not automatically entail 
a rich system of “ideas” of colored surfaces in our minds. Attention, memory, the 
organization of the color space (surface), and paths of visual attention are neces-
sary to produce a selected set of “color ideas”. Higher levels are only achieved if 
other types of sensibility are integrated and form an organization linked to objects, 
events, and actions.8 As the divergence of color terminologies in the languages of the
6 This barrier is clear for animals like apes, dogs, and ﬁsh. Social coordination can, in these cases, 
only be enabled by instincts or by very few learned reactions. Aspects of linguistic reference to 
odors in texts about perfumes are treated by Peter Holz (2005; in German). 
7 Translation by the author: Condillac, 1755/1821: 111. “Un peintre et moi nous voyons également 
toutes les parties d’un tableau: mais tandis qu’il les démêle rapidement, je les découvre avec tant 
de peine, qu’il me semble que je voie à chaque instant ce que je n’avais point encore vu”.

generalize this claim given a synesthetic reorganization of particular sensibilities (the old idea of a

world shows, the need for a basic (stable) set of color terms is very variable between 
languages, even on a similar level of cultural development. Therefore, communica-
tion about colors is not a universal and central concern of linguistic communities. 
This restriction does not preclude that the cognitive relevance of color perception is 
very high in individual perception, i.e., perception and communication do not share 
the same functional pattern and do not respond to identical (or similar) needs. They 
follow their speciﬁc principles and laws. 
In the following, I summarize the signiﬁcant ﬁndings of the color project directed 
by Kay (cf. Sect. 2.1.1 in Wildgen [14], in German).9 The starting point (in addition to 
historical approaches by Young, Helmholz, and Hering) are publications by DeValois 
and Jacobs [7] on color perception in monkeys of the Old and New World, especially 
in macaques and marmosets. A comparison between macaques and humans in tests 
distinguishing ﬂickering light from three steady light sources with decreasing inten-
sity (same wavelength) indicates that color receptivity is almost equal for both species 
(see DeValois and Jacobs [7]: 535). A distinction is made between “non-opponent” 
cells, which generally register the light intensity, and the “opponent” cells, which are 
relevant for color perception. Four types of opponent cells could be distinguished 
(ibid. 538): 
• (+ R, −G): They are excited by red and inhibited by green; 
• (+ Y, −B): They are excited by yellow and inhibited by blue; 
• (+ G, −R): They are excited by green and inhibited by red; 
• (+ B, −Y): They are excited by blue and inhibited by yellow. 
In anthropological linguistics, Berlin and Kay [2] have examined the elementary 
color vocabularies of different language cultures and the color values assigned to 
color words. A comparison with the physiological data resulted in a differentiation 
hierarchy, i.e., if the degree of differentiation of color terminology increases in one 
language or the transition from one language to another, the options can be foreseen by 
color physiology.10 To a certain extent, culture-invariant color vision determines the 
basic color lexicon. This result speaks for a weak cognitive determinism. Figure 2.1 
shows the hierarchy found.
Rosch-Heider and Olivier [11] compared the color categorization of 40 Dani (New 
Guinea) speakers and 41 American speakers. The Dani language has only two color 
categories: mili (dark and cold colors) and mola (light and warm colors). As in Berlin, 
and Kay [2], the Munsell color chart serves as the basis. The memory tests showed 
signiﬁcant differences, i.e., the average number of correct identiﬁcations was 7.7 for 
Dani speakers and 11.7 for Americans. The question was whether memory accuracy 
is related to the color lexicon, i.e., whether a more differentiated inventory enables 
a better memory of color words. For this purpose, the authors compared perceptu-
ally adjacent color values concerning the same or different designations in Dani or
‘sensus communis’). Cf. for an elaboration of this point, Chap. 7: “Eight Theses for (or Against ?) 
a Semiotics of Colour” in Caliandro (2019).

American English. The differences were not signiﬁcant,the authors concluded that 
the structure of the color lexicon does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence color memory, i.e., 
the cognitive performance of the color memory does not depend on the performance 
in the naming of colors. The authors also found that American speakers did not use 
basic color terms in almost half of the naming, preferring other strategies (object 
naming, metaphorical expressions, etc.). 
Dubois [8] discusses the methods and results of the color project by Kay and others 
critically and adds research with a modiﬁed methodology on Palikur, a language 
spoken in Saint Georges de l’Oyapock, French Guyana. She sketches the method as 
follows: 
It (this study W.W.) conﬁrms prior observations concerning the restrictive number of stable 
denominations of colors in Palikur, namely priye (black–dark), seye (white–light), duw˜e 
(red), ayeweye (green–blue), kwikwiye (yellow), that can be considered as “basic color 
terms” according to Berlin and Kay. But our procedure highlighted three other strategies 
mainly used by Palikur speakers when asked to describe colors and especially colors (equiv-
alent of orange, brown, pink, violet, or grey) for which there is no simple lexicalization in 
Palikur (ibid. 103). 
Dubois (ibid.) mentions the following strategies: 
• A morphological strategy using a color term to which a shape classiﬁer is added. 
• A syntactic strategy where the color term comes along with a modiﬁer (adverb or 
adjective). 
• A semantic strategy of metonymy by using a word referring to another object to 
extract its color (ibid., shortened). 
Although the universality of color terms or their sequence of appearance remains 
controversial, it became clear that putting the perception of colors (in context) in 
words or utterances is a complex activity that is, in many cases, successful. Therefore, 
skepticism regarding the linguistic realization of primary color perception is not 
warranted. Instead, color perception and the perception of spatial contours, lines, 
and other visual features can achieve the status of symbolic forms in a semiosis that 
uses more general resources. We shall discuss the symbolic forms based on visual 
perception in Chap. 4. 
In a given linguistic community, some sub-communities, i.e., those of painters or 
other professionals, develop speciﬁc visual competencies and techniques of teaching 
or even arguing about colors which modify the demands on communication about

colors. Models of colors like those designed for and by artists help to enrich and 
stabilize professional codes about colors and point to the underlying categorical 
architecture of communication. 
Our reﬂections point to three signiﬁcant problems or problematic transitions 
between “sensibility” (perception) and “sense” (meaning in a symbolic form, e.g., 
language): 
(a) 
The transition from single sensibilities, e.g., olfaction or color sensibility, to an 
integrated perception is crucial. 
(b) The transition between presentation and representation must consider the effect 
of attention, memory, and spontaneous imagination. 
(c) 
The transition between perception, governed by principles of human neural 
architecture and dynamics, and communication, based on social interaction and 
organization principles, asks for a change in the theoretical frame. 
The most dramatic transition and the evolutionarily most recent one is that of 
(b) to (c). At level (c), speciﬁc human capacities are concentrated in the plurality of 
“symbolic forms” discussed by Ernst Cassirer. They will be the topic of this book’s 
Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6. As a kind of preparation for these central chapters, the notion 
of the symbolic form should be elucidated. 
2.4 
What Are Symbolic Forms? 
Cassirer introduced the notion of symbolic form in his “Philosophy of Symbolic 
Forms”, published in three volumes between 1923 and 1929. It contains two 
constituents: “symbolic” and “form”. The term form was a central topic in Chap. 1 on 
morphogenesis, which includes the notions of morphè (form) and genesis (becoming, 
creation). The term symbolic refers to symbol, a polysemic notion used in philosophy 
and aesthetics. A discussion of the range of meanings of this notion would ask for 
an independent treatise. A proper starting point is the notion of symbol in the theory 
of signs proposed by Charles Sanders Peirce in the second half of the nineteenth 
century (cf. for further comments on Peirce and Cassirer Chap. 7). 
Peirce considers three fundamental aspects of the sign, the central notion of semi-
otics, in its relation to the sign object, the content of the sign, and its reference to 
existing entities or processes in the world (the reality of dynamic processes): icon, 
index, and symbol. In this constellation, the notion of the symbol has to be delimited 
concerning the two neighboring concepts of the index (existential reference) and 
icon (reference via similarity, conceptual neighborhood). In a letter to Lady Welby 
on October 12, 1904, Peirce gives a summary of his position (developed after 1867, 
as he tells her; Wiener [12]: 391). 
I deﬁne a Symbol as a sign which is determined by its dynamic object only in 
the sense that it will be so interpreted. It thus depends either upon a convention, a 
habit, or a natural disposition of its interpretant (that of which the interpretant is a 
determination). (ibid. 291f).

2.4 What Are Symbolic Forms?
23
This deﬁnition needs clariﬁcation. The “dynamic object” is, in Peirce’s termi-
nology, the real-world object, the ultimate intention of the sign in its real-world 
usage. Peirce’s statement tells us that the symbol only indirectly relates to it (“in 
the sense it is interpreted”). The interpretation depends on dispositions, habits, or 
conventions (see above). These determinations introduce a moment of arbitrariness; 
they depend on chance or, eventually, on many minimal causes beyond rational 
control. In the case of dispositions and habits mentioned by Peirce, one can assume 
rules of behavior that were acquired but gained law-like signiﬁcance. In the case of 
conventions, these forces include cooperative effects in a community or conformity 
in social behavior. 
A proper delimitation of the term “symbolic forms” (in the context of this book) 
says that they depend on the interpretation by individual users and conformity to the 
usage in communities. Their morphogenesis is, therefore, less natural or spontaneous 
than the morphogenesis in plants or animals. It presupposes the effects of human free 
will and the cooperative dynamics of socially conforming behavior. Previous sections 
of this chapter have shown that primary perceptual processes, such as those observ-
able in olfaction and color vision, are still near to natural (bodily) morphogenesis. In 
contrast, colored surfaces and objects or artifacts (art) are symbols in the sense of the 
deﬁnition given by Peirce. In the case of odors, smell, and taste, artiﬁcial norms and 
devised terminologies can produce a symbolic level on which such perceptions are 
conventionalized and efﬁciently communicated. Nevertheless, we only treat music, 
art, language and myth/religion as fundamental symbolic forms in this book. Our 
analysis could probably be expanded to technology, ethics, and other communication 
ﬁelds following the lines of investigation demonstrated in Chaps. 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
The ﬁrst two symbolic forms of music and visual artifacts have a dominant 
founding in speciﬁc physical conditions: auditory perception and the motoric capac-
ities to produce music in the ﬁrst case, and visual perception and motoric capabilities 
for creating visual artifacts on the other side. In the case of myth and religion, a 
complex of bodily conditions, mental dispositions, and social demands shapes and 
changes the symbolic forms. Language, an evolutionary late-comer, has a broad ﬁeld 
of interacting capacities and needs as sources. Its relation to myth and religion is one 
of co-evolution and interdependence. The symbolic forms of music and visual forms 
make use of the complexities of language to elaborate their repertoire culturally.11 
The multimodality of visual, acoustic, and linguistic communication is also a concern 
in social semiotics based on the linguistics of Halliday and further developed by van 
Leeuwen, Kress, Bateman, Wildfeuer, and others. See for an overview focusing on 
applications in web design, comics, ﬁlm, audio-visual materials, and video games, 
Bateman et al. [1].

for this book has been published (in English) in Wildgen [15].

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms 
in Music 
Abstract The symbolic form of music was not in Cassirer’s original list, but it is 
fundamental because it shows the impact of sensory and other bodily conditions on 
symbolic forms. The morphogenesis is ﬁrst analyzed concerning evolution, starting 
with Paleolithic musical instruments (35,000 BP). The perception of music is the ﬁrst 
dimension of embodiment. We can distinguish the organ of balance and the cochlea. 
Complex musical forms demonstrate the elaboration and diversiﬁcation of basic 
morphogenetic patterns. Motion control and motion perception is the second relevant 
dimension in the morphogenesis of music. Finally, since baroque theories of music, 
emotion is considered fundamental. We apply an actual, evolutionary, and cognitive 
model of human (and animal) emotion. A particular focus is on melodies (or themes 
in larger pieces of music). Eventually, ﬁve applications range from songwriters (Bob 
Dylan and Leonard Cohen), a string quartet by W. A. Mozart, fugues by J. S. Bach, and 
quasi-narrative patterns in ﬁlm music to innovations in the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst 
centuries.

Introduction 
The biological1 morphogenesis of sound production with the aim of communication 
goes far beyond our species and concerns a large part of the animated world. In the 
context of human communication and culture, the proper reference is the morpho-
genesis of symbolic forms in music linked to the auditory capacities of humans and 
the types of acoustic communication involving the human voice or ear and other 
organs able to produce and interpret human sounds. This analysis can be enlarged 
to musical instruments, i.e., the technology adjacent to and derivative from human 
sound communication.

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
The semiogenesis of musical forms has an evolutionary, a historical (develop-
mental), and a synchronic or ad hoc creative dimension. We shall start with the 
evolutionary dimension and the cognitive dispositions for music that follow from 
it, speciﬁcally the embodiment of music and its relation to the physics of sound. 
The fundamental problem of musical semiotics concerns the meaning of music. It 
is assessed independently from the realization of meaning in linguistic forms (cf. 
Chap. 6). 
3.2 
Evolutionary Morphogenesis of Musical Forms 
The acoustic manifestations of all living beings in an area are a part of the complex 
animated and communicative phonosphere, which can be distinguished from natural 
sounds such as wind and weather, falling trees, and ﬂowing water.2 In the origin 
of vocalizations and music by hominins, for example, in the savannahs or at the 
edges of forests in South and East Africa, the sounds of prey and predators and 
their accompanying noises had vital importance. At an early stage, such as in the 
species Australopithecus, which had a hard time with predators (such as leopards), it 
is likely that the precise analysis of the acoustic input, i.e., the location of extraneous 
signals, dominated. A further condition of auditory communication is the focus of 
common perception because acoustic signals orient the collective perception toward 
a selected ﬁeld. The warning call indicates danger, a disturbance in the ecology. The 
sexual partner’s lure replaces or completes social functions like a scent mark. The 
phonetic proﬁle also serves to identify individuals and thus enhances social bonds, 
for example, between mother and child. At a close range, in safety (in the tree or the 
cave), the voices and sounds uttered by group members were the essential components 
of the phonosphere. They could be used in various functions, such as mother–child 
communication, sexual attachment, and tool-making/tool-usage teaching. Enhanced 
by these uses, acoustic signs gave relevance or meaning to environmental phenomena. 
For the further development of music, the use of instruments was essential. These 
can ﬁrst be characterized by their material composition. Even today, instruments 
made of wood or metal can be distinguished in an orchestra. Since metals were 
available as material only beginning with the Chalcolithic (Copper Age), wood, tree 
bark, reeds, grasses, and others were probably the basic materials. In addition, bones 
and horn components served as musical instruments. The earliest ﬁnds of musical
2 The evolution of the larynx that connects the throat to the rest of the respiratory system is more or 
less contemporary with the evolution of vertebrates, and 230 million years ago, a broad spectrum 
of acoustic performances existed already. The families of animals developed different organs for 
sound production and reception on different scales of frequency. The physiological conditions for 
acoustic sound production near to language were fulﬁlled in the era of Homo erectus (1,8 million 
years BP). The question remains open at what date humans were able to use the symbolic potential 
of this acoustic capacity (cf. Habib [13]). Insofar as music does in general not presuppose this 
elaboration, it may be much older. Analogies of human music with the sound production of birds 
suggest a very deep evolutionary source.

instruments are those of swan bones (with perforations for sound modulation, age 
about 35,000 years BP), i.e., an archaic ﬂute. 
As African and Australian music traditions show, wooden instruments, e.g., drums 
made of hollow trunks, played a signiﬁcant role in the development of instrumental 
music. These were supplemented by ﬂutes (for example, based on a reed, bamboo, 
and animal bones) and simple string instruments. Examples are the instrumentation 
of bands in West Africa, which were the starting point for early blues orchestras: 
banjo, ﬁddle, and drum; the banjo combines a drum and a string instrument. 
The masterful playing of these instruments could only succeed based on ethno-
musical and ethnic-acoustic knowledge. Viewed from a modern perspective, the 
musicians have developed an intuitive, trial-and-error-based “technique” of music 
that has been handed down through generations. As lithic, wood, and metal tech-
nologies are a deﬁning feature of our species, a close relationship between music 
and craft/technology is apparent. Additionally, both the mythical ﬁgures of Orpheus 
and the role of music in rituals (Olympic Games, Dionysus cult, tragedies of Sopho-
cles) refer to the magical–religious and thus to the social and political dimensions of 
music. These usage contexts shaped the semantics and pragmatics of musical signs. 
A further important feature was virtuosity, which appeared in mythical ﬁgures, such 
as Linos and Marsyas, whose art aroused the envy of Apollo. 
Within the human phonosphere, language has to be separated as a particular form 
from music, although there are numerous transitional forms (song, poetry) and cross-
relationships (accent, rhythm, tonal languages). In the further development of human 
musical competence, the construction of instruments and instrumental music (drum, 
lyre, ﬂute, etc.) played an important role. The separation of instrumental music from 
song and language since the seventeenth century is still characteristic of Western 
music and inﬂuenced globalized music traditions. 
Human sound perception and production are ﬁxed genus-speciﬁcally by the 
hearing and the voice organs (from the larynx to the lip). The conditions and poten-
tials for song and speech are essentially the same. However, priorities are set in 
the respective cultural exploitation of the potential, or development opportunities 
may remain unused.3 Instrumental sound generation mimics the physical condition 
of bodily sound production, extends it, and brings technical innovations into play. 
Thus, drums follow from stamping and clapping; string instruments and ﬂutes imitate 
vocal articulations. In some cultures, inharmonic tones are used, equivalents of the 
consonants in human language (this also applies to modern music with noise compo-
nents). The intensity proﬁles on the frequency scale, which are the basis for both 
vowels and voiced consonants, are, at the same time, the matter from which musical 
scales emerge (see Leman [22]: 63 ff.). Prosodic patterns of language, as well as 
musical beat, tempo, and phrase, make use of temporal characteristics. Together 
they form the shared basis of language and music in humans. This aspect will be 
elaborated on in Sect. 3.7.

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
3.3 
The Embodiment of Music and Ecological Semantics 
The analyses of meaning in language and other symbolic forms,4 e.g., music and 
visual art, have evolved the last decennia from descriptive and logical strategies to 
consideration of cognitive aspects and aspects of embodiment, i.e., the whole body 
and not just the brain as relevant background. However, the human body (and brain) 
is in an evolutionary continuity with the bodies of other animals and dependent on 
the ecology, climate, and immediate context. The meanings of utterances, music, 
or visual designs go beyond arbitrary attributions of contents. The physical world, 
the body/the brain, and symbolic forms like language and music stand in the conti-
nuity of cause and effect. Scientiﬁc theories in this ﬁeld should be able to cover 
this continuum. The French mathematician and philosopher René Thom proposed 
“semiophysics” as the proper designation of this endeavor.5 Our analysis chooses 
a strict naturalizing strategy, i.e., it considers with preference aspects of musical 
meaning that can be connected to natural phenomena lying outside the proper domain 
of music and thus are promising candidates for explaining the musical meaning. Three 
foundational ﬁelds must be considered: ﬁrst, the transition from musical aesthesis 
(sensitivity to music) to musical perception and performance; second, archetypal 
emotions as primary motivations of musical meaning and musical communica-
tion; and third, bodily motion and temporal patterns of music (linked to physical 
kinematics). 
3.3.1 
The Perceptual Sources of Symbolic Forms in Music 
To ﬁnd the meaning of musical signs, we must ﬁrst ask for the fundamental meanings 
of acoustic signs in the context of human hearing. Since this was optimized in evolu-
tionary history in speciﬁc directions, questions of the function and the biological 
impact of hearing arise. In the evolution of hearing, two lines are to be distinguished. 
They are manifested in the construction of the human inner ear: 
• The balance organ is primarily responsible for the adjustment to gravity (top– 
bottom) and also corresponds to frequencies from 100 to 500 Hz at a sound 
pressure of 70 to 80 decibels. Deep and loud sounds and prominent rhythms, such 
as in dance music, lead to “hearing” with this organ.
4 The following passages reconsider passages of the contribution of the author to the 15th Inter-
national Congress on Musical Signiﬁcation, in Barcelona, 15 to 19 of June 2022; cf. Wildgen 
[48]. 
5 Thom’s semiophysics Thom [38] can be understood in the tradition of psychophysics (e.g., Fechner 
and Helmholz in the nineteenth century). Parncutt ([33]: 16f.) even points to reﬂections of Jean-
Philippe Rameau’s”Traité de l’harmonie” (1721) that point in this direction. Parncutt coined the 
term “psychoacoustics”: “Psychoacoustics is concerned with the relationship between the physical 
properties of stimuli and observers’ descriptions of the sensations they evoke” (Parncutt [33]: 17). 

3.3 The Embodiment of Music and Ecological Semantics
29
• The cochlea was developed in land-living animals about 380 million years ago in 
the Devon period. As a result, it has a broad spectrum of hearing in humans and 
very high sensitivity. 
The bourdon produces relatively static, mostly deep sounds, which serve as a 
reference point for the melody line. They are often built into the instrument, such as 
the bagpipe or the hurdy-gurdy. Mostly, they are tuned to the basic tone of a chord or 
the ﬁfth. In Western music history, the basso continuo or ostinato played an essential 
role in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and modern rock and pop music 
rely on very intense bass tones. It is this component of music that strongly motivates 
body movements. This music component’s importance is closely linked to whole-
body responses in the individual and the collective attunement to a simple, repetitive 
motion stimulus. The musical sign refers to the physical/physiological effects on the 
individual body. Secondarily, it serves the coordination of movements in the group, 
for instance, in dance, at work, or in a battle.6 
The cochlea (in the inner ear) and auditory stimulus processing are characterized 
by their frequency domain (20–20,000 Hz), their sensitivity, the rapid processing 
of very complex sounds, and polyphonic or polyrhythmic structures. This feature is 
a prerequisite for most cultures’ rich musical traditions. The invariants behind this 
cultural wealth refer to physical and auditory acoustics laws. Consequently, aural 
perception and the ecology of hearing, the “affordances” in ecological psychology 
(cf. Gibson [11]), have been tuned to these laws. 
The physics of overtones in the human voice and musical instruments remains 
an essential pillar of human perception and control of musical forms. The overtones 
deﬁne a space of simultaneity and have a regular physical (and physiological) equiv-
alent.7 At the same time, this paradigm can be stretched in time, i.e., the resonating 
overtones can be “spelled out” as elements of a melody. As a result, the syntagmatic 
(sequential) order inherits the natural ordering system of the overtones. The space 
of possible auditory distinctions is vast at this primitive level. Sundberg ([35]: 62) 
computes a maximum of 1400 pitch distinctions and 280 distinctions of loudness. 
This wealth amounts to a space of approximately 400,000 distinctions. Memory
6 The Scottish bagpipe, for instance, was a typical accompanying instrument in a battle, like a 
drum in nineteenth-century continental armies. Indirectly, this component bundles the attention and 
thus reduces the general stimulus and information ﬂow. In this function, it has the opposite effect 
compared to language. 
7 The human vocal tract roughly corresponds to an open tube on one side. Essential for the tube 
are, ﬁrstly, the vibration depending on the length of the tube, and secondly, the sound showing 
the simultaneous presence of harmonics, whose intensity, however, decreases with frequency. This 
condition results in the so-called natural tone series, based on a division of the tube length by the 
natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc. Intervals naturally become smaller and smaller until they 
reach the threshold of human interval perception and perceptual intensity. A natural tendency in 
cultural expression was a limitation of the admitted dividers. Nevertheless, in terms of number 
theory, no consistent transposable scale can be set up (cf. Parncutt [33]: Sect. 3.3). The tempered 
scale was ﬁrst adopted for keyboard instruments (cf. Bach’s Wohltemperiertes Klavier, 1722) and  
then generalized throughout Western and other musical cultures. 

30

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
effects impose the ﬁrst severe restriction because memory works like a hedge in the 
cerebral recognition and assembling of complexes of musical signs. 
As a consequence of these conditions of sound perception in humans emerges the 
phenomenon of categorical perception, i.e., the transitions from continuous scales (in 
physics) to boundaries imposed on this continuum, together with a radical reduction 
of the space of choices in musical perception.8 Musical perception does not only 
concern single musical sounds but simultaneous complexes (cords) and sequences 
(themes, melodies). The physical and physiological interaction of single sounds with 
their array of overtones produces auditory effects called “rough timbre” or “ugly 
combinations” (cf. Sundberg [35]: 70). These phenomena correspond to periodic, 
quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamic patterns.9 The consonance and dissonance are 
an immediate effect of these natural, non-conventional patterns of musical percep-
tion. The primary gestalt characteristics of musical perception emerge from the 
physical and physiological laws and their correlation due to evolutionary processes. 
The dynamics of aesthesis build the immediate ground of musical meaning and open 
the mind’s window for it. 
The syntagmatic (sequential) order can inherit the natural ordering system of the 
overtones. This effect manifests in the tonic scale steps (I–VII) and the tonic levels: 
Tonic (I), Dominant (V), and Subdominant (IV), which show up most clearly in the 
classical ﬁnal sequence (cadence) I–IV–V. Further central deﬁnitions, such as the 
major–minor contrast, and generally the classical tonality follow from it. Insight into 
the conventionality of this system prepared its abolition in the so-called atonal or 
pan-tonal music of the twentieth century. 
3.3.2 
Basic Emotions and Paths in an Emotional Space 
as a Potential for Musical Meaning 
The meaning of music refers to fundamental processes connected to the human body. 
These include bodily needs, desires, and aversions that can be summarized under 
“Emotion”. Music and emotion have been linked since antiquity Aristotle’s affect-
doctrine identiﬁed lust–sorrow–dislike as a set of fundamental affects/emotions from 
which he derived eleven composite affect-types. This classiﬁcation played an essen-
tial role in history; it was modiﬁed many times until the Renaissance. René Descartes 
(1596–1650) suggested a resonance model explaining the effect of music, where 
the music moves human emotions (musica movet affectus). According to this idea, 
the harmonies in music trigger corresponding movements of the soul. They consist
8 This transition is the standard topic of catastrophe theory and is encountered on many levels of 
semiosis. Cf. Wildgen [41] for catastrophe theoretic semantics. 
9 Sundberg mentions that if one adds a bass tone, this may “mask these ugly combinations” (ibidem 
70).

of “spirit” (breath) ﬂows and their cerebral effects.10 In baroque music theory, this 
teaching was translated into compositional techniques. Both the keys and the interval 
ratios were related to emotional content. Example: small second > plaintive; minor 
chord > mourning; large intervals, i.e., deviations from the unison or small inter-
vals > violent movement of the spirits. The characteristic of major and minor was 
arithmetically established in a rationalistic fashion. The “perfect” major triad, such 
as C-E–G with the simple proportions 4: 5: 6, was characterized as funny, cheeky, 
and sublime, and the “imperfect” minor triad A-C-E with the proportions 10:12:15, 
on the other hand, as sad or tender. This tendency remained inﬂuential in musical 
practice until the nineteenth century (see Eicken [8]). According to the baroque theo-
rists, music’s effect on affects is based on several features: the interval relations in 
melody and harmony, tempo and measure, dynamics, sonority, and ornamentation, 
and ﬁnally, the characteristics of the instruments, which can stand for single affects. 
Until recently, the affects/emotions themselves could only be described intuitively, 
as there were no new insights based on observational or experimental data. This situ-
ation has changed with modern evolutionary and comparative neurology. Therefore, 
it is helpful to start with their ﬁndings. Panksepp and Biven [31]: 16 divide emotional 
processing into three levels: 
(1) Lowest level. Primary emotional processes refer to instincts. 
(2) Middle level. Secondary processes of emotional control. These are learned in 
early childhood but cannot displace the primary processes (conversely, learning 
depends on emotional enhancers or inhibitions). 
(3) Upper level. Knowledge and consciousness-driven emotion. Feelings such as 
trust, pride, shame, and guilt are developed at the middle level and can be 
elaborated into an ethical–religious code. 
The following mainly deals with the two basic levels of emotional meaning. 
However, the upper level remains relevant to music’s overall impact and embedding 
in social discourses and contexts. 
Based on neurological observations (brain scans, local stimulations) and exper-
iments (mainly with animals), Panksepp and Biven [31] propose seven “ances-
tral passions”, i.e., evolutionarily fundamental emotional reactions that produce 
emotional complexes at the middle level. They form the basic vocabulary and the 
deep structure of musical meanings: 
1. A more general emotion/motivation is called SEEKING: “The SEEKING system 
wants to motivate her [the mother] to ﬁnd food and shelter” (ibid. 25). It often 
forms the background for other emotions, so it is a kind of primal motivation. 
2. A group of emotional processes that cause aggression, violence, and fear, on 
the one hand, and lust, on the other: ANGER, FEAR, and LUST. These can be 
associated with speciﬁc chemical carriers and can be medically inﬂuenced in 
therapy (unless an intense ﬁxation on the middle and higher levels prevents this). 
For example, music can be violent and cause fear. However, it can also generate

mechanism.

feelings of pleasure. That is why music is often described as a drug or employed 
in the context of drug use. 
3. The emotional dimension of PANIC/GRIEF is evident in separation distress and 
is therefore closely linked to the CARE affect, caring for the offspring, and other 
related parties. Complex middle-level emotional entities such as LOVE combine 
SEEKING, LUST, and CARE emotions. In speciﬁc cultural contexts, love codes 
can emerge, which in turn take shape in music codes; see, for example, the 
medieval minnesong (“Minnesang”) and its sociological analysis by Luhmann 
[26]. 
4. Finally, Panksepp and Biven [31] introduce the PLAY dimension, universal in 
young people and adolescents. This motor-driven emotion is usually neutral to 
dominance and aggression and is primarily fun. In addition, roles are systemat-
ically exchanged. The ﬁeld of available behavior is extensively explored in the 
game,it is clearly expressed in the animal kingdom beyond humans. This dimen-
sion is the most important for musical meaning. However, it is already at the 
upper end of the instinct-oriented ﬁrst level in the transition to learned behavior. 
The game is also the basis for social well-being and laughter, social contact, and 
the management of coordination or conﬂict. It is one of the starting points in the 
evolution of human language (see Wildgen [43]: chapter 3 for the role of laughter 
in the evolution of language). 
Game motivation is sensitive to disturbances, e.g., risk (FEAR), aggression 
(RAGE), loss (PANIC/GRIEF), or shortage (hunger, thirst). One can conclude that 
music generally requires a stress-free situation or promotes its realization. As an 
acoustic play, it works for both actors and listeners. The latter may dance, move 
rhythmically, or, as visitors to a classical concert, only perform inner movements such 
as dreaming and imagination. Panksepp and Biven point to the function “experience-
expectant”, i.e., the participants are in a state of expectation of a (joyful, pleasurable) 
experience. They expect certain moves, are surprised when different ones surface, 
and build up new expectations (see ibid. 374 ff.). 
As seen from the above, musical meanings can be interpreted as movements in an 
emotional space. However, in some cases, subspaces may also come into play. For 
example, a battle song or musical accompaniment in battle (e.g., in Napoleonic times) 
mainly activates the RAGE dimension (and possibly the enemy’s FEAR dimension). 
In contrast, songs for children and lullabies are more likely to affect the CARE 
dimension. 
The ethnic diversity of symbolic forms in music may hide, modify, or elaborate the 
basic emotions just classiﬁed. For example, musical practices studied in New Guinea 
(Kaluli group) “are oriented to making the listeners sad and nostalgic, organizing 
feelings of sadness and eventually moving them to tears” Finnigan ([10]: 356). Other 
traditions (northern Sierra Leone) combine sorrowful songs “with the enjoyment of 
responding, clapping, and dancing.” (ibid.). In ethnic musical traditions, the style 
and dominant emotions are part of a code,the songs are “thoughtfully composed 
and deliberately rehearsed” (ibid.) to trigger emotional effects. Such symbolic forms 
of music are at the third level (knowledge and consciousness: see above). Their

3.3 The Embodiment of Music and Ecological Semantics
33
embodiment is indirect via learned (or at least reinforced) emotional content. In 
rituals, on the background of myth and religion, they become integral to a (local) 
culture.11 
The PLAY dimension, mostly without speciﬁc goals or purposes, has a side effect. 
It blurs the relation between musical forms and particular emotions. The meaning 
of the music becomes non-representational. It cannot be described as a projection of 
musical features onto a set of emotional values. Moreover, the musician completes his 
musical performance with gestures and facial expressions and adds personal feelings 
that the audience may perceive. They interfere with the emotional effects planned by 
the composer.12 
3.3.3 
The Meaning of Complex Musical Creations 
in European Music 
In Europe during the last three centuries, music culture experienced the most aston-
ishing heights in parallel with the technical and scientiﬁc development (from Bach 
to Haydn/Mozart/Beethoven and the New Music of the twentieth century). At the 
same time, popular music captured all areas of life. As a result, music has become 
part of an all-embracing medium of visual, linguistic, and musical signs in opera, 
musicals, and ﬁlm. However, this complexity, this wealth, and the manifold relation-
ships between various media make it difﬁcult to properly assess the speciﬁc meaning 
or even the individual or collective effect/relevance of music. 
A musical performance, whether it takes ﬁve minutes or two hours, gives rise 
to a kind of phonosphere. This harmonious environment captivates the concertgoer 
and the attentive listener in front of his sound system. When Stravinsky develops a 
complex sound fabric in the “Sacre du Printemps”, he expects musicians and listeners 
to connect to a full “spring awakening” experience. A phonosphere is created in which 
listeners empathize mutually. They can use it as orientation in their overall perception 
of the music. The development of European music since Richard Wagner shows that 
very different sound architectures can create an impressive phonosphere with musical 
instruments and vocalists. This effect is pertinent even for the experiment of twelve-
tone music. Although it radically changed the conventions of classical composition, 
it was obliged to ﬁll the natural phonosphere of human hearing with a wide variety of 
musical motion and tension. Even serial music and modern experimental music, e.g.,
11 Coded emotions open the risk of deceit or faking. Even in the case of professional musicians, the 
question of honesty or ﬁdelity to the emotions intended by the composer arises. If the composer 
lived in a different period or context than the performing artist, it does not seem easy to guarantee 
the ﬁdelity of the interpretation. The artist will rather stick to the score, or fake emotions he/she 
thinks are acceptable to the public. 
12 The strategies of musical performers may be very different. For example, some piano performers 
prefer a neutral, quiet behavior (bodily motion, mimics); others present vivid changes in their body 
posture and their mimics. This body motion (or neutrality) can inﬂuence, enhance, complete, or 
disturb the perception of musical meaning. 

34
3
The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
by Iannis Xenakis (1922–2001) and György Ligeti (1923–2006), are not meaningless. 
The composers merely abandoned meanings that had become cliché and looked for 
new possibilities of expression. After a relatively short period of negation, a new 
realm of musical meaning was opened; Hiekel [18] speaks of a two-year tunnel and 
a kind of musical Dadaism. This development is apparent, for example, in works by 
Helmut Lachenmann (born 1935: “The girl with the matches”, 1997) or Clemens 
Gnadenstätter (born 1966: “Music for solo ﬂute” from 1991). In this connection, 
Hiekel (ibid. 18) quotes a statement by Roland Barthes: “Once you have chased 
meanings out of the house, they come in through the window”. 
Loss and creation of meaning stand in a dialectical relationship, i.e., typically, a 
succession of change and persistence prevails. Returns to earlier stages are possible, 
and longer phases of stability or even rigidity may exist. The scales, chord hierarchies, 
and counterpoint relationships may be changed or even replaced, but movement 
patterns, tensions, and their resolution remain. Attraction and repulsion, reduction, 
and over-stimulation are the constants behind the change. It is, therefore, suggestive 
to see the proper existence of meaning in these movements and tensions. In the 
following, this track will be pursued, starting from the listening individual and the 
cognitive processes in their mind/brain (cf. the notion of mind/brain in Panksepp and 
Biven [31]). 
3.4 
Motion and Forces as a Potential for Musical 
Semiogenesis 
It is helpful to start from a set of levels to formulate a model of musical semiogenesis 
based on human motion and locomotion and the forces that direct them. A rough 
classiﬁcation into a sub-conceptual, a conceptual, and a symbolic (linguistic) level 
is straightforward. The ﬁrst level works automatically and is based on sensory and 
cortical mechanisms; the second requires mental work and learning processes and is, 
therefore, culture-dependent. The third brings advanced symbolic systems (similar to 
the grammar of a language) into play. The dynamics (forces and induced movements) 
are naturally different at the three levels distinguished in Chap. 1 from instinct-driven 
to rational semiogenesis. 
Many authors in the tradition of Lakoff and Johnson (1980), who have tried to 
apply the methodology of cognitive semantics to music, argue that the connection is 
a kind of metaphor: 
Musical motion must be some metaphorical motion that takes place within a symbolic space. 
One purpose of this chapter is to explain the metaphoric structure and logic of such motion 
and to ask what this means for how we experience and understand music (Larson [21]: 63). 
“Metaphor” is a traditional concept issued in antique rhetorics and poetics. This 
means it is a high-level concept for the analysis of artful uses of language and not 
able to clarify basic cognitive or even physiological processes. Human motion and 
locomotion are ﬁrst linked to physical processes in space/time; second, they exhibit

3.4 Motion and Forces as a Potential for Musical Semiogenesis
35
motor processes of the body controlled by cognitive dynamics and speciﬁed in basic 
learning processes. They are not high-level functions of human creativity or poetic 
reﬁnement. Third, multimodal processes, for instance, dance, ballet, and dramatic 
performance on stage, induce or coordinate motion. Therefore, the relation of bodily 
motion to music is a direct one, accessible to causal analysis and not just some 
poetic phantasm. There is no plausible reason musical analysis should persist in 
the vague, metaphorical perspective, where everything is a metaphor for everything 
else. We shall concentrate in the following section on the more basic, quasi-automatic 
correlations between music and human motion. 
3.4.1 
Bodily Motion (Kinematics) as a Source/Origin13 
of Musical Semiogenesis 
The processes of physical exercise, e.g., walking, jumping, and dancing, are subject 
to dynamic laws roughly analogous to physical processes such as free fall, pendulum 
motion, and power transmission of billiard balls, with speciﬁc restrictions. The human 
gait in walking and running is a major source of rhythm in music. It shows in multi-
modal phenomena involving music like a march- or dance music. The double meter 
seems to dominate, but the triple meter is quite frequent.14 Walking and dancing are 
subject to coordination dynamics, i.e., the motion of the right and the left leg are 
coordinated. In horses, the speed of locomotion changes the motion pattern abruptly. 
In a simple experiment, the in-parallel motion of ﬁngers changes to antiparallel due 
to higher speed (Fig. 3.1).
Kelso [19] uses the model Kelso-Haken-Bunz in Synergetics to describe such 
coordination processes generalized for different levels “From Matter to Mind”. In this 
line, musical rhythms can refer to coordination patterns in the auditory brain, among 
groups of different muscles, and ﬁnally between physical subsystems in a coordi-
nated mode (Hermann Haken took the primary mechanism from Laser-physics; other 
classical mechanisms are coupled oscillators).15 
A side effect of this correspondence is that a metronome can implement the 
rhythm technically. The gesture is a particular form of movement that emerges 
from the ﬁeld of physical movement and contains an intentional momentum; see
13 Bodily and behavioral characteristics found in fully unfolded forms can be projected back to initial 
conditions that were decisive for all further developments. The source or source domain designates 
the starting point of morphogenesis, in which basic topologies and mechanisms can be detected. 
They are responsible for many of the developments occurring later on; cf. Thom ([37]: 168–172). 
14 In social semiotics (cf. van Leeuwen [39]: 48f.), the double meter is associated with the meaning 
“collectivity” (cf. marching or dancing in groups), and the triple meter with “artiﬁciality/nobility”. 
15 Human motion was already a topic for Galilei, who is the founder of modern kinematics and 
dynamics. In Synergetics, an interdiscipline based on laser-physics and thermodynamics, the gaits 
of animals and the coordinated motion of humans are analyzed on par with other spatiotemporal 
patterns in the inanimate world; cf. Haken ([14]: Part II: Behavior).

nodding, pointing, or eye-gazing. In music, gestures have a relatively broad inten-
tion linked to internal states or movements. A melody may be decomposed into 
several gestures, some of which are within the boundaries of beats, some exceeding 
them. Kühl ([20]: 168 f) demonstrates a division into musical phrases/gestures based 
on examples from Mozart (Piano Sonata in A major, KV 331) and Charlie Parker 
(Bloomdido). The emotional effects of pitches and their movements (high–low tone, 
ascending–descending) have been frequently discussed but seem to be culturally and 
individually very variable (see ibid. 177 f.). In any case, the internal correlate is an 
emotional movement neurologically associated with a brain area, e.g., connected to 
the hypothalamus and the limbic system. These “movements” are correlated with the 
release of messenger substances and the activation of electrical signals. 
The conceptual level (without symbol structure) can be described as a tonal space, 
so melodies are movements in this tonal space. Classical terms such as scales, keys 
(e.g., major and minor), chords, and tonic levels (I–VII) can be introduced here. 
The dynamics can be mapped on paths through the tonal space. Motion is described 
by vectors (direction, strength) and similar mathematical concepts of linear algebra. 
On the symbolic (quasi-linguistic) level, partial movements (melody phases, motifs, 
movements of a piece of music) are arranged into a discursive unit. Narrative and 
rhetorical patterns (metaphors and metonyms) will most likely become relevant.16 
16 The dynamics are similar. For an overview of cognitive grammar, see Wildgen [44]. Metaphors 
and metonymy are treated in the chapter: Cognitive models and metaphor (Lakoff), 65–90 (in 
German).

3.4 Motion and Forces as a Potential for Musical Semiogenesis
37
3.4.2 
Bodily Forces (Dynamics) Motivating Musical 
Semiogenesis 
Physical forces apply when a movement is redirected (change of direction), accel-
erated, or decelerated. Larson ([21]: 321) describes (ibid. 312) “musical meaning as 
an emergent property of the musical forces”, but he understands “musical forces” in 
the sense of Talmy’s “force dynamics”. In our morphogenetic view, musical forces 
are embodied physical forces. Three types of musical phenomena can be linked to 
embodied forces: 
• Forces are effective when a movement is redirected (change of direction), 
accelerated, or decelerated. This can be done in the three areas indicated above. 
• The rhythm can be doubled or varied (e.g., from 3/4 to 2/4), speeded up, or slowed 
down. Messiaen proposed complex transformations of the rhythm in 1944. For 
example, the addition of an eighth note or the punctuation of a note produces 
the modiﬁed rhythms: 3/4 → 13/16 or 2/4 → 5/16 (see Bogue [5]: 26). The 
acceleration and deceleration are in an indexical relationship to physical and 
mental movements or affects; the audience is moved (in upward and downward 
movements), goes along, or is synchronized with the rhythm of the music. Often 
a balance is sought over a longer period; acceleration is followed by deceleration. 
This can also be observed in audio-visual art, for example, in ﬁlm (see Wildgen 
[45]: Sect. 7.4: 217–233: in German; and Wildgen [46]: in English). 
The melodic structure of a song can emanate from the main tonic level and end 
with it. In the intermediate ﬁeld, dominant and subdominant transitional ﬁelds build 
a tension of difference. In piano playing, the two hands can have different melody 
lines, or one hand can have an accompanying and decorating function. The same 
applies to the choir (canon or polyphonic singing) and orchestral music. The art 
of counterpoint exploits the tension between the main motive (Dux and its vari-
ations) and the countermovement (Comes). The iconic (imaginistic) reference to 
gestures (e.g., visible in dance) implies a gestural dynamic consisting of acceler-
ated/slowed gestures, stagnation, complication phases, and intensity maxima. The 
indexical (causal) relations correspond to vectorial relations, such as a force trans-
mission (type billiard ball), addition, subtraction of vectors, and more complicated 
patterns. In this domain, concepts of linear algebra can be applied (instead of vague 
“metaphors” or diagrams in Lakoff’s or Talmy’s style). 
The mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) dealt with the 
determination of dissonance/consonance as early as 1739, setting up a sequence of 
consonances: prime > ﬁfth > fourth > major third/major sixth > minor third/minor 
sixth/great second > minor seventh > major seventh > minor second and the tritone 
(see Mazzola [27]: 57). In general, musical intervals can be described by a landscape 
of attractors (sinks of a potential). For example, Chella ([6]: 196) shows a dissonance 
curve for the scale values of C4 (roughly in the middle of the piano keyboard). The 
dissonance measure of the pair (C4, G4) is 0.39 (consonant), while the dissonance

38

measure of the pair (C4, Db4) = 2.56 (dissonant). Taking the frequency scale as 
abscissa gives a potential curve (cf. Fig.10.7, ibid. 196 and Mazzola [27]: 61). 
3.4.3 
The Morphogenesis of Melodies 
Melody and pitch movements are paths in a landscape17 where the dissonance minima 
are attractors (here, the movement stops), dissonance maxima are avoided, and 
moderate dissonances serve as transition areas. These movements generate tensions, 
which can contribute to a speciﬁc musical meaning. 
Melody and forces 
Melody can be memorized, stimulate repetition, and, as a whole, justify appreciation 
(see the effect of catchy tunes). In more extensive pieces of music, the melody is 
usually limited to one phrase, one motif. Its character as a building block becomes 
apparent when the melody is repeated, varied, and transposed, i.e., presented in 
different “dresses”. It then acts like a person, a role in a drama. Primary melody 
curves already show up in the infant’s crying, which is the phonetic starting point of 
language (see Wermke and Mende [40]). The most straightforward building block 
is the rising and falling fundamental frequency (F0), ranging from 300 to 500 Hz,it 
forms a melody arc. This structure is further developed in babbling and later forms 
the underlying musical form of two-syllable words (see ibid. 637f.). However, the 
laryngeal control of phonation by the infant must ﬁrst be expanded by the muscular 
control of the oral cavity so that more precise articulations can be mastered, which 
allows the distinction of phonemes and words. It is also the context for the unfolding 
of the musical melody. The vocal range of humans usually frames the melody of a 
song, e.g., the song corresponds to the comfortable tonal space of a male/female/child 
voice. This tonal space has an upper and lower edge and an intermediate zone. The 
melody can go from the bottom to the top, stay in the middle for some time, progress 
step by step, or move variably back and forth. In addition to a general up-and-down 
movement, one can also observe fast-changing variations of the melodic line, as 
they often occur in jazz variations. The experienced instrumentalist “decorates” the 
melody line with fast movements and trills. 
The course of the melody has a center that can be used as a zero expectation of 
melody progression, i.e., no change of pitch or a minimal one results in no melody, a 
“unison”. The melody is then the deformation of this standard, and the deformation 
energy can be determined from the deviations from the center. Most folk music and 
songwriters’ songs have a ﬂat melody curve that approximates that of language. 
The curve then descends toward the end of the line or stanza or increases (as in the
17 The mathematical space of the 12 half-tones of the Western (tempered) scale can be constructed as 
a torus of tierces; pathways and symmetries on the torus (cf. Mazzola [27]) stand for basic movements 
and dynamics in music. In a similar way, rhythms and meters can be treated mathematically,cf. 
Papadopoulos [32]. 

3.4 Motion and Forces as a Potential for Musical Semiogenesis
39
Fig. 3.2 The melody course as a result of forces acting on a medium level 
intonation of questions). Leyton [23] assumes a “memory” of the deformations (of 
ideal forms) as the speciﬁc meaning of a melody. It contains information about forces 
that have become effective and inﬂuenced the melody’s design. For the performer, 
for instance, the singer, these forces correspond to efforts that the voice must make to 
produce and control higher or lower notes. For the listener, either it is more difﬁcult 
to perceive, recognize, and process high and low tones, or the listener imagines the 
forces applied as a potential performer. The professional opera singer may indulge in 
artistic coloratura and amaze his audience; the heroic bass may force his voice into 
the deepest cellar. However, we ﬁnd very ﬂat melodies when we look at the catchy 
hits or songs that delight a mass audience. The forces that shape the melody, moving 
it away from a neutral middle tone, can be imagined as the effect of forces that push 
the melodic line up or down concerning the middle (comfortable) level (Fig. 3.2). 
Overall, a melody can thus be strong or weak concerning applied forces. Powerful 
and low-energy passages can alternate in a song or a piece of music. In the ﬁnal 
result, it often comes to a balance, or either the ascending or the descending forces 
predominate. These movements are perceived as sign shapes and associated with a 
dynamic meaning. Downward movement may, e.g., express sadness or resignation, 
and an ascending movement, on the other hand, enthusiasm or hope. 
Levels of motion in a melody 
It is also possible to distinguish a “melody in steps” from a “melody in triads”. In 
the ﬁrst case, e.g., in Gregorian chant, the melody more or less follows the steps of 
the scale, in seconds and thirds, rising or falling. The singer’s experience associates 
ascension with a (muscular) tension, an effort; descent to the center is experienced 
as relaxation or ease. The same applies to acceleration or deceleration of the tempo. 
The triadic melody uses the different tensions of the intervals in a melody. Seconds, 
thirds, fourths, ﬁfths, sixths, and sevenths (intervals) have different tension values. 
The partial movements of the melody can also be assigned to a chord scheme, i.e., 
they realize in time the consonant notes of a chord or a dissonant combination of 
pitches. These movements and tensions (which refer to forces) thus represent the 
possible meanings (“signiﬁé”, signiﬁcant) of a melody. The duration of individual 
notes also plays a crucial role. In the late Middle Ages (thirteenth and fourteenth 
centuries in Europe), the duration of the notes, which were initially based on the 
length of the syllables (long vs. short), was further differentiated. The mensural 
notation facilitated the ﬁxation of this innovation. In the polyphonic movement,

40
3
The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
one voice could be noted in longer note values (for example, the bass), while the 
other voices used much smaller note values, that is, a faster melodic movement. 
The chords to which the steps of the melody refer are arranged in levels: tonic, 
dominant, and subdominant (in the context of tonal music). The melody can stay 
within one level, exploit the possibilities, and switch to another. This directly affects 
the accompaniment, which is why, for example, the guitar accompaniment for a song 
is indicated by the key above the text or the musical notation. In many cases, the 
notation of the keys is a kind of shorthand melody, i.e., the musician can remember 
the melody based on the chord progression and vary or embellish it within the given 
scheme. Important centers of attraction (tonal centers) and organization are.

Within each level, the possible sequences through the scale and chord structure are 
speciﬁed as a triad, four-note chord, and others. The effect of the melody is based on 
the sequence of stages, on the possibility of a change from major to minor and vice 
versa, and on the tensions between the individual steps, which can also be varied 
through different durations, accents, and tempi. A song’s relatively simple chord 
scheme may be elaborated in its further development (e.g., from a simple blues song 
to jazz interpretations or improvisations). Berendt ([4]: 132f.) shows this in the case 
of a popular jazz theme of the 1920s: “I cannot give you anything but love”. The 
original chord progression: C6–Am–Dm–G7 is elaborated as follows: C6–Dm7– 
Em7–Ebdim–Dm7–F6–Dm7/9–Db7/9. In the further variation and improvisation of 
a theme, there may be variations in both the execution within a chord scheme and 
the sequence of chord schemes (within a particular harmonic framework). If the 
theme is generally known, it can even be pushed into the background; it remains 
implicitly present through individual features or characteristics (for the performers 
and competent listeners). 
The meaning space of music 
A central problem of dynamic modeling in musical semiogenesis concerns the nature 
of the space of meaning in which the performer and the listener move. We have already 
referred to the space of objective, physical motion as a tonal space, e.g., the frequency 
range of a voice or instrument. In the case of music, the space of meaning does not 
correlate with the space of the world as experienced visually or through action but 
instead with an inner space, which, however, must be transparent and comprehensible 
to musicians and listeners. One can also call it the mental space of music and then try 
to use neuroscientiﬁc methods to test hypotheses about the structure of this space. 
For the time being, it is a hypothetical construct based on the intuition of musicians 
and their listeners and the analysis of musical works. The temporal structure of the 
melody can be enriched or modiﬁed in three ways: 
1. Variation of the rhythm. In the development of jazz, a variation of the original 
marching rhythm in the New Orleans style with an emphasis on the ﬁrst and 
third beats in the 4/4 m was followed by an emphasis on the second and fourth

3.5 Some Examples of a Morphogenetic Analysis of Music
41
beats (in contrast to European tradition). This happened in the Dixieland and the 
Chicago style of jazz. In the bebop style, the staccato of the accents is replaced by 
legatos, creating a kind of continuity. Finally, fast and changing rhythms dissolve 
or override the ﬁxed meter in free jazz. The dominance and freedom of rhythmic 
design is a trait that jazz has inherited from African traditions or rediscovered 
through a return to ethnic music cultures from different parts of the world. 
2. Adaptation to individual instruments and situational demands. The artists design 
a melody regarding their instrument (for example, the saxophone, the clarinet, 
the trumpet, and the guitar). Additionally, they can adapt their performance to 
momentarily perceived internal dynamics, i.e., to the physiological–emotional 
component of their performance. 
3. Adapting to other musicians and the performance of the band. The soloist “res-
onates” with the performance of others. The result is often referred to as swing; it  
captures the players and then the listeners. This aspect is especially pronounced 
in the religious gospel, where the (singing) preacher brings the church to ecstasy 
(see Halle [15]: 143–152). 
This approximate analysis does not reveal the secrets of a perfect melody. What 
makes a melodic line/phrase so memorable that it becomes a catchy tune or circulates 
in countless versions in a musical culture for decades? How do the diverse melodic, 
harmonic, and rhythmic tensions combine to form a successful ﬁgure that gains 
cultural signiﬁcance? At the basis of this problem, we suspect complex cognitive 
and social (group-speciﬁc) coordination processes in the interaction of a band with 
its audience. The underlying cerebral and communicative processes are still largely 
unknown. 
After this presentation of rather general, dynamical concepts for the morphogen-
esis of music, more speciﬁc features of musical composition will be analyzed. Our 
starting point is songwriters’ music, speciﬁcally Bob Dylan (1941–) and Leonard 
Cohen (1934–2016). A further section exempliﬁes aspects of the PLAY dimension 
of music in the string quartet, understood as a conversation between four instru-
ments (and players). It is exempliﬁed with the help of the String Quartet No. 19 
in C Major, K. 465 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Next, complicated sequencing 
patterns in the fugues of Johann Sebastian Bach elaborate the PLAY dimension in 
musical morphogenesis. A further example concerns music’s processual and quasi-
narrative aspects (for instance, in program and ﬁlm music). Eventually, more recent 
advances in muso-mathematics and computerized music are discussed. 
3.5 
Some Examples of a Morphogenetic Analysis of Music 
The focus of our analysis on the morphogenetic aspects of music has the consequence 
that evolutionary, developmental, and historical processes are highlighted. This deci-
sion is a programmatic step that negates the neglect of all questions of becoming or 
causation linked to natural phenomena in the tradition of structuralism (after de

Saussure 1916 and followers in the twentieth century). Nevertheless, the morpho-
genetic analysis does not preclude the analysis of existing music works, their design, 
and their efﬁciency. On the contrary, the dynamic paradigm allows for new insight 
into classical musical analysis. Our analysis starts with popular music, speciﬁcally 
the music of songwriters Bob Dylan, the Nobel prize winner in 2016, and Leonard 
Cohen; see Wildgen ([47]: 125–140) for a detailed analysis (in German). The other 
examples focus on classical music, the string quartet (Mozart), the art of fugues 
(Bach), program music, quasi-narrative music features, and computerized music. 
3.5.1 
Gestures in Bob Dylan’s Song: Tambourine Man 
(1964) and Musical Forces in the Song “Hallelujah” 
by Leonard Cohen (1984) 
Musical gestures establish an external reference, i.e., the sphere of musical meanings 
goes beyond and “transcends” intra-body references and their empathic transfer to 
other bodies. A musical gesture can have the form of a short melody or a phrase in a 
larger piece of music. A higher level of organization is reached by “phrase groups”. 
At this level, conﬂicts may appear. Drums or other rhythm instruments can express 
the dimension of a body-based meter, e.g., the guitar played by Bob Dylan in example 
1 (cf. Table 3.1). His singing, however, depends on the phrase structure of the text. In 
the coordination of both dimensions, a rich ﬁeld of interactions is activated, which 
is further complicated by microstructures, i.e., minor deviations, often character-
istic of the style or the performance of a singer/musician.18 The morphogenesis of 
musical forms at this stage manifests principles of self-organization, coordination 
between different, even conﬂicting forces, and ratiogenetic procedures in optimizing 
the commercial product, public musical performance.

18 Eventually, quasi-rhetoric patterns show up in the sequential schema of Exposition, Develop-
ment, Recapitulation, and Coda. The art of sequential organization can be admired in Bach’s work 
on fugues and the tradition of counterpoint. Although such sequential patterns may allude to syntax in 
human languages, a denotative, descriptive, narrative, or even argumentative organization of mean-
ings and referential intentions is lacking. This is not a shortage but a virtue of musical communica-
tion. The complementary nature of musical versus linguistic meaning opens the ﬁeld for enhancing 
interactions between language and music in multimodal performances.

The guitar of Bob Dylan plays the musical rhythm; the motions of his right hand 
realize the basic meter, his left-hand moves from one chord to the next, and his voice 
sings the melody and articulates the text. Thus, his performance realizes three types 
of bodily motion patterns. In a strict sense, only the third part can be analyzed as a 
sequence of (indexical) gestures, i.e., it points to a goal and has an intention, whereas 
the singing voice follows the phrasal structure of the text. At the end of the whole 
stanza, Dylan adds a 2/2 m (not shown in the table) to ﬁnish the stanza on the ﬁrst 
meter of the next unit instead of the third beat of a 4/4 m (cf. Kühl [20]: 189). 
The melody in the song “Hallelujah” by Leonard Cohen moves in a ﬂat curve 
around G/A in the ﬁrst ten beats. After “It goes like this”, it climbs up in steps until 
it reaches the E’, one octave above the starting point. The repeated “Hallelujah” 
descends in a wave-like movement until it reaches the lower and ﬁnal C, the resting 
point (the song is written in C). 
Professional singers can range up to two octaves. The usual range of a male singer 
is little more than one octave. Leonard Cohen starts on a deep level (like a bass); 
thus, he can master the range from the low C (the ﬁnal note) to the high E without 
difﬁculty. For many lay singers, the range of this song asks for special effort. The 
central area between C (low) and E (high) is around G/A. This was also the dominant 
area in the introductory ten beats. If we apply Leyton’s concept of memory of forces, 
we can draw the following schema of applied forces (Fig. 3.3) (Video link: http:// 
www.leonardcohen.com/). 
Leonard Cohen started his career as a writer of poems and turned to music (in 
an interview, he said that selling music allows for a living while selling poems does 
not). He wrote almost 40 stanzas of this song. In one of them, mainly the ﬁrst one 
performed, he even described the musical movement of his melody:

Thus, the author of this song was aware that making music is a kind of itinerary 
in a musical landscape.
3.5.2 
The String Quartet as a Musical Conversation 
Complex musical forms have existed since ancient times, and the records of the music 
of non-European and remote ethnic groups attest to the wealth of musical inventions 
in all cultures. Polyphony is only one aspect of such complexity. Polyphonic music 
probably arose in free improvisation for the pleasure of sounding together. From the 
thirteenth century onwards, it was institutionally consolidated and written down. It 
reached its peak in the form of the string quartet, introduced by Luigi Boccherini and 
Joseph Haydn around 1760 and masterfully executed and further developed by Haydn 
in particular. The starting point was probably the trio sonata for two solo instruments 
and continuo that Arcangelo Corelli (1653–1713) had developed from 1681 onwards. 
The quartet eventually was the perfect form, for Haydn experimented with a quintet 
but returned to the quartet. But why four instruments from the violin family (two 
violins, viola, and cello), and why just four musicians? The violin family covers 
the required tonal range and allows for a great variety of expressions both through 
the variability of the individual instruments and their characteristics as through the 
expressiveness of the moving bow and the tremolo of the ﬁngers (the strings can also 
be plucked). In addition, the number four has a discursive plausibility: four educated 
people exchange their opinions, respect each other in their diversity, and harmonize. 
It is not about the duel of two opponents but about what we have in common in 
diversity.19 
This diversity and the speciﬁc role played by the violoncello are visible in the 
score of the “String Quartet No. 19 in C Major”, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 
Three voices start one after the other; the violoncello plays a simple bass pattern. 
All three instruments are present in the third bar and coordinate to a crescendo. 
The harmony in this phase is slightly dissonant, which is why this quartet has also 
been called “Dissonance”. In the Allegro part of this introduction, the dissonance 
is resolved in a C major. The music alludes to different cooperative (occasionally 
slightly disharmonious) conversations (Fig. 3.4).
The playing of the string quartet is also transparent to the listener; in particular, 
the individual instruments and their performers come to their right but with varying 
emphasis. With a large symphony orchestra, this transparency is more difﬁcult to
19 Mazzola [27] explains in the chapter "The Theory of the String Quartet" that the number of four 
instruments represents the minimum for the complete development of a three-dimensional tonal 
space (pitch, deployment time, duration) with two technical parameters (bow pressure, bow speed), 
i.e., in a ﬁve-dimensional parameter space. The harmony of triad coverings leads to a map with 
three elements multiplied by a three-part cadence, i.e., nine dimensions. The inequality gives the 
number of instruments required (n): n + 5 ≥ 9. According to this, the number of instruments must 
be at least 4: 4 + 5 = 9, which satisﬁes the inequality. The form of the overall musical sign, in this 
case, the concerto of the string quartet, is based, at least in its contours, on the formal conditions 
resulting from the material (the instruments) and the tonal space to be ﬁlled.

achieve. In many cases, the powerful overall sound of the big orchestra comes to the 
fore, although soloists or the conductor may focus on the public’s attention. 
3.5.3 
Pursuit and Escape in the Dynamics of the Fugue 
In the animal world, pursuit and escape are basic patterns of locomotion, at least 
since the Cambrian revolution, called the “biological Big Bang” (approximately 543 
million years BP). Young animals prepare for pursuit activities, and children play the 
game mouse and cat or cops and robbers, even in modern societies where predation is 
not a shared experience. In Western movies, endless pursuits ﬁll the scenario (mostly 
on horses); in the James Bond series of movies, different kinds of this play are shown: 
in cars or other mobiles, in boats, planes, helicopters, or running on roofs (in Siena: 
cf. Wildgen [46] for an analysis of movie-physics in James Bond). 
The name fugue derives from Latin fuga, which means escape. In the act of musical 
pursuit and escape, the ﬁrst movement introduces a theme (by one voice, e.g., the 
tenor); it is picked up by another voice, which, in many cases, enlarges the subject 
and then passes it on to yet another voice. The voices already introduced continue on 
their course; they virtually “chase” the ﬁrst, i.e., the “stolen” theme. A simple form 
of this game is the popular canon; while one part of the choir continues to sing, the 
other part starts with the melody, and so on, if more than two parties are involved. 
Eventually, all parts of the chorus close on a ﬁnal chord. The individual parts of the 
choir go through the song in a time-delayed manner, creating a polyphonic structure. 
In J. S. Bach’s work on the fugue, two-fold and three-fold canons are represented, 
and a kind of mirror theme may be added to the respective melody. He composed 14 
elaborated fugues over the ﬁrst eight notes of an aria from the Goldberg Variations. 
Bach’s “The Art of the Fugue” is an artistic presentation of the astonishing richness

46
3
The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
Fig. 3.5 Topic (Dux) and response (Comes) in Bach’s Contrapunctus I (eight bars shown) 
of possible variations. In the following, a sketch of the dynamics of this pursuit and 
escape, based on the musical form of the fugue, is given. 
It is characteristic of the fugue that the theme repeatedly occurs in different voices, 
variations, and keys. The Comes is a way of answering a topic, often on the ﬁfth step of 
the key.20 The individual fugues of the work contain more complex forms, double or 
multiple fugues, reﬂections, and symmetries, and have an exemplary, almost didactic 
character, while, at the same time, the variety of possible forms and thus the freedom 
of the composer become clear (Fig. 3.5). 
The Contrapunctus I is written in D minor; accordingly, the theme begins with D 
and ends with D in the ﬁfth bar. Simultaneously with the end of the theme (Dux in 
the alto voice), the Comes in the soprano voice begins, shifted by a ﬁfth, with A and 
ends with A at the beginning of the ninth bar (not shown in Fig. 4.7); in the bass, the 
theme is taken up again in bar 9 and the Comes in the tenor part in bar 13. A few 
episodes follow. At the end (coda) of the fugue, the tenor part resumes the Comes 
in A (cf. the schematic analysis in Heinrich [17]: 103). The C sharp in bar 3 can 
be considered the symmetrical midpoint of the dux,the eighth notes in measure 4 
form a “movement impulse” since they repeatedly serve as “motivic initiator of the 
opposing voices, countersubjects and interludes” (Eggebrecht [9]: 54). 
The musical effect of the fugue consists, on the one hand, of the strong coor-
dination of the voices through polyphony, and, on the other hand, of the counter-
point, which introduces different kinds of countermovements and melodic conﬂicts. 
The development of the fugue or, generally speaking, of a more extensive orches-
tral work can be described as the unfolding of a musical score. On the one hand, 
there are modulations, i.e., a given structure is transposed and varied. Leyton [24] 
describes transposition as a “telescoping” similar to the optical telescope; the rings 
are shifted so that the same image appears at different distances. In music, this does 
not happen continuously but along a hierarchy (e.g., by a shift to the ﬁfth). The 
unfolding proceeds from a regular expectation hierarchy, a standard, and an ideal 
image. If this expectation is broken, it creates an aesthetic appeal (ibid. 151ff.). The 
essential momentum consists of transfer effects from (past) given, known, to (future) 
new musical structures. 
The instrumental music of Bach (and the baroque music that ends with Bach) 
has a playful character (see the ancestral emotion PLAY in Sect. 3.3.2) in several 
respects:
20 “Topic theory” was developed by Leonard Ratner (1916–2011); cf. Mirka [29]. 

3.5 Some Examples of a Morphogenetic Analysis of Music
47
• There is a ﬁnite number of elements and forms deﬁned by scale, keys and tonal 
steps, classes of topics (Dux, Comes), and voices: bass to soprano; canon or 
two-voices, four voices. 
• There are several operations: repetition (with variation), inversion, mirroring, and 
crab motion. 
• The procedural structure is deﬁned, at least in outline, by an exposition at the 
beginning, a sequence of dux-comes ﬁgures (with interludes), and a conclusion 
(coda) with a return to the original key. 
• In Bach’s fugue work, a macrostructure can also be observed in the sequence of 
the individual fugues (Contrapunctus I–XVIII as numbered by Heinrich [17]). At 
least the simple fugues (I–III) are followed by the double fugues and later the 
mirror fugues. The nature and reasons for these structures are, however, disputed. 
The classic game chess shows a similar array of ﬁgures and moves. Possible 
macrostructures can be found in collections of famous games. The emotional struc-
ture is also part of the game to a certain extent. Thus, the game of chess is geared 
toward competition, struggle, and victory (checkmate) with intermediate steps such 
as winning chess pieces or opening or closing paths (possible operations). In music, 
the tempi, accelerations, loud–quiet transitions, changes from major to minor, and 
the dominance of voices/instruments are emotional triggers in the musical game. 
The Art of Fugue belongs to Bach’s late work. It contradicted the dominant zeit-
geist, which preferred the elegant (French) style, easier access for the general public, 
and a reference to the word/song. In the Viennese Classicism period (approximately 
1770–1830), Bach’s work ﬁtted into the new image of musical genius and became a 
model for many composers (e.g., for Beethoven). 
The playful character of the music becomes even more evident in the second 
Viennese school, especially in the work of Schönberg and the serial music of the 
twentieth century. Hermann Hesse emphasized this aspect of music as an abstract 
game in his novel “The Glass Bead Game” (begun 1930; ﬁrst edition 1943). In 
European music, the 12-tone scale, in which major and minor chords, as well as 
the tonal step model, had been eliminated, was a drastic change in the “rules of the 
game”. If the guiding function of certain tones or tonal steps is canceled, the tonal 
architecture becomes freer and more open. To compensate, however, new rules had to 
be introduced. For example, one rule states that in a sequence of tones in the 12-tone 
row, all tones must be realized either in sequence or as chords, avoiding repetitions 
that could create a focus. 
3.5.4 
Quasi-narrative Structures in Music and Their 
Dynamic Equivalents 
In many publications (especially in the tradition of structuralism), narrative structures 
of music are put to the fore (see Grabócz [12 and Tarasti 36]). However, in most cases, 
narrative patterns in music are language-independent because they exhibit more basic

48
3
The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
dynamic patterns known from the theory of dynamical systems. The processual, 
quasi- “narrative” character of music refers to a more general behavior not expressed 
speciﬁcally through language. The archetypal “narrative” beyond language has three 
levels of dynamics that complement each other: 
1. General structures of events. They characterize the envelope of the entire move-
ment. In terms of the theory of dynamic systems (cf. Wildgen [42], second 
part), there are several basic types of dynamics: The simplest development of 
an unstable dynamic system in time is the “fold”, characteristic of the beginning 
and the end. More complicated courses of events are the bipolar change between 
states A and B, the change with three states A, B, and C, where B represents a 
metastable transition zone, and the continuation of this series. These dynamic 
patterns can be called “narrative” because they share dynamic characteristics 
with storytelling. 
2. The second level concerns the speciﬁc types of locomotion, their patterns of 
movement, and the coordination of several components of movement (such as 
legs and arms) or different persons in joint movements. Music develops this 
basic set of motion patterns into a rich ﬁeld of modulated motions experienced 
acoustically. 
3. Moving toward a goal often happens in phases. In a mountain hike from one 
mountain hut to another, the huts are the resting points; in between, there are 
steeply rising, descending, ﬂat, or smaller up-and-down sections. There may be 
obstacles (chasms, ravines, rock walls, rivers, etc.) that must be overcome. There 
are signs of fatigue (at the end of the hike) and brisk stride (in the morning). 
Similar proﬁles are conceivable in larger pieces of music, e.g., in overtures to an 
opera or symphonies. 
A plausible hypothesis says that musical dynamics are closely linked to movement 
dynamics and reﬂect them. The dynamics of movement can be divided into phases. 
There is a beginning and an end (this applies on a small scale to subunits of a piece 
of music, the movements of a sonata, and the stanzas of a song). There are different 
tempi and rhythms, acceleration and deceleration, and there are climaxes and steps to 
the climax or down to the endpoint. There are tensions between the individual forms 
of movement, for instance, height and energy differences. Music may be intentional 
in some of its forms. However, it is self-referential, like dance or children’s games. 
3.5.5 
Muso-mathematics and Computerized Music 
Mathematical considerations were already central to musical thinking and composing 
in antiquity. We cannot review the further evolution of the dialogue between music 
and mathematics. Still, in the twentieth century, with synthesizers and computer-
aided music, mathematically sophisticated types of music became dominant, at least 
in the avant-garde scene. Muso-mathematical considerations played a role in musical

composition since Claude Debussy (1862–1918) and Olivier Messiaen (1908–1992). 
The topological network of tunes already explored by Leonard Euler in 1739 was 
rediscovered at the end of the nineteenth century and gave rise to the “Tonnetz”-
architectures of music based on mathematical group theory. The “Tonnetz” (German 
expression for a musical network) is a torus of tunes based on the intervals: ﬁfth, 
major, and minor third. It can be ﬂattened for easier understanding and use; cf. the 
description in Andreatta ([2]: 81–84) and Bergstrom et al. [3]. 
Practical consequences of the Tonnetz-intuition for composition can already 
be found in the work of Claude Debussy. “Many of his works are characterized 
by complex symmetries, transpositions, and proportions” (Pagano [30]: 90). Even 
geometrical proportions like the Golden Section, already used in antiquity and specif-
ically in Renaissance art (e.g., by Leonardo da Vinci), play a fundamental role (cf. 
ibid.). Thus, music is systematically related to spatial patterns transposed into the 
temporal mode that dominates musical performance. Messiaen not only consid-
ered prime numbers and palindromes in his compositions, but he introduced non-
Western scales and free rhythms (ibid. 92f.). In his “Traité de rythme, de couleur 
et d’ornithologie”, published 1949–1992 (see Messiaen [28]), he gives a table of 
the prime numbers smaller than the number 100. He discusses their role in musical 
composition (cf. Papadopoulos [32]: 541). Papadopoulos made a mathematical anal-
ysis of the rhythms Messiaen chooses from historical (Greek and Indian) sources 
and his innovative use of mathematical insights in his compositions (ibid. 540–564). 
Moreover, Messiaen had an intuitive notion of color in music, a suggestion that other 
musicians of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries followed. If the musical style, its 
use, and the transformations it allows refer to geometrical notions as those explained 
by Felix Klein’s Erlangen Program (i.e., basically group theory), the next generations 
of composers took up the suggestions of Thom’s morphogenesis (cf. Andreatta [2]) 
and the concepts introduced by Chaos Theory and Fractal Geometry, for instance, 
Georgy Ligeti (1923–2006). Pagano [30] analyzes Ligeti’s piano studies: Vertigo, 
L’Escalier du diable, and Columnia inﬁnita (written around 1991). She writes: “the 
Devil’s Staircase is a mathematical function and the piece effectively describes it” 
(ibid. 96). 
These hints may be sufﬁcient to show that mathematical models of music are not 
only a possible means to understand music; musicians also use them to compose 
music and open new ﬁelds of musical performance and understanding. In many 
treatises, music is understood as a kind of language, and the analysis of language 
is used as a foil to the analysis of music. The following section will examine the 
analogy between music and language and the differences in their morphogenesis.

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
3.6 
Similarities and Differences in the Morphogenesis 
of Music and Language 
Rousseau believed that the origin of language lies in music and the expression of 
passion through music. This origin, in his view, is obscured, blurred, and even 
erased in language by the deliberate reduction to a small set of sound shapes. In 
poetic language, a mood or temper remains that refers to passion, called “accent” by 
Rousseau. In ordinary discourse, “articulation” dominates. This historical answer to 
the question precedes the development of modern evolutionary theory and considers 
language as a degeneration of music. The question of the evolutionary relation-
ships between the morphogenesis of language and music is still unsolved. The most 
plausible answer assumes a kind of co-evolution. 
3.6.1 
The Co-evolution of Language and Music as a Source 
of Common Features 
Language and music probably have, as their sources, speciﬁc types of bodily motion 
and locomotion, their rhythm and resilience, the coordination of moving body parts— 
legs, arms, hands, head, and eyes—as well as the coordination in a human group 
activity such as hunting and making/handling of tools. If sounds served as signals in 
the evolution of language, as shouts or drums did, later on, speaking in songs could 
become music.21 The transitions are ﬂuid. In many cultures, ritual utterances have a 
rhythmic, even melodic, diction, usually with a restricted tonal range. There are two 
signiﬁcant patterns separating language and music: 
(1) In early and exotic cultures and Western mass culture, the songs are charac-
terized by constant, almost monotonous repetitions. This moment is probably 
“inherited” from the signal function of animal sounds. The phenomenon of repe-
tition can appear in language as echolalia and ritually monotonous speech, for 
instance, in the litany. This phenomenon is, however, marginal in language. In 
classical musical art, repetitions are common. In complex musical forms, they 
are masked by variation or counterpoint and later by serial effects. 
(2) The rhythm of music goes beyond the simple patterns of intonation (i.e., varia-
tion in pitch) of language. Especially in cultures without pronounced polyphony, 
complex polyrhythmic structures arise. This may be related to the function of
21 Pygmy women in Central Africa behave differently than men: “Women’s speech is more song-
like than men’s, and they accompany each other’s utterances with sung expletives that contribute to 
increasing the volume and distinctive melodiousness of their conversations.” Lewis ([25]: 83). As 
pygmy populations may be characteristic of early hunter–gatherer populations, this feature could 
point to a source of the morphogenesis of music in female conversation. However, as we presume 
that music has the same age as language, both origins are very far from actual music and language 
use. Therefore, such a hypothesis cannot be validated. Cf. Sect. 6.1 for the origin of language. 

3.6 Similarities and Differences in the Morphogenesis of Music and Language

drums as signaling instruments and the unfolding of the possibilities of this 
acoustic source. 
The emergence of musical scales, the normalization of intervals, is a later process. 
The singing voice is often variable and glides in the intonation without the attunement 
to the norms of a speciﬁc music culture. Early simple instruments were not exactly 
tuned or consonant. In addition to the natural disposition of the ear, which is sharpened 
in the context of instruments, instrumental music may have been the main promoter 
of development. Stumpf ([34]: 40) compares their effect with writing. For example, 
the production of ﬂutes and pipes sets standards for sound intervals. A particular tone 
scale becomes the social norm by using the same instruments over generations or their 
exact reproduction. This development also ﬁxes the intervals of the singing voice, 
i.e., it counteracts the natural uncertainty of the singing voice. Similarly, writing 
standardizes ﬁrst the texts, for example, in the hieroglyphic texts of the Egyptian 
temples and tombs, then the spoken language; cf. the development of an alphabetic 
writing system that ﬁxes its sound structure. With the standard scriptural norms, 
such as in classical Latin or Arabic (and other frozen (dead) standard languages), the 
grammar and style of a language are forced into the harness of strict rules. Something 
similar happens with music, ﬁrst in the ritual context (for example, in the religious 
festivals of the Greeks and Gregorian chant), then in secular music. 
The divergence of language and music in later periods led to conﬂicts between 
musical and linguistic norm structures. As long as the religious (and, by analogy, 
the secular) song was monophonic and limited in length, text and music could run 
in parallel and repeat or continue simple patterns. However, as the lyrics became 
longer and less repetitive, an extension of the musical pattern became necessary. As 
a result, the differences between linguistic and musical norms sharpened. The music 
of a song can obscure the linguistic message or even reduce it to a melodic line. 
The increasing dominance of musical accompaniment (in the baroque, for example, 
through the organ) competed with the message and text character of the song. In 
opera (for example, in Wagner) or lyrical, musical performances (such as Henze or 
Schönberg), the listener must know or read the text to understand the lyrical intention. 
The zones of coordination between language and music are “hinge joints” of 
multimodal communication,22 i.e., although, in general, these symbolic forms have 
their character, a common denominator exists, such as regularities of adjacency 
or subordination. There are (at least) two major coordination axes of multimodal 
symbolic forms: 
(1) The lexicon of topoi 
Known from rhetoric, topoi (sometimes called "commonplaces") are subject 
areas that can be the topic of speech and discourse. They crystallize as relevant 
in historical development and constitute a ﬁnite inventory. Agawu ([1]: 41 ff.)
22 In the human skeleton, hinge joints like a knuckle or elbow allow the coordinated movement of 
limbs. Similarly, different modes of symbolic communication, e.g., language, music, and dance, 
have speciﬁc zones in their organization where their interaction is crucial, for instance, rhythm in 
music and dance or meter and rhythm in lyrics. 

52

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
compiled lists of topoi for particular periods of Western music. In the Baroque 
period, a narrow, word-oriented meaning assignment of musical ﬁgures and a 
coarser global content assignment (res) were distinguished. At a time when 
instrumental music competed with and surpassed the vocal, the paradigmatic 
change from textual meaning to pure musical meaning became obvious. Only in 
the program music of the nineteenth century did tendencies toward “speaking” 
music reappear.

It determines the beginning, climax, and end of a musical phrase. The ending is 
called “cadence”. This connects the listener’s expectations, surprise, suspense, 
satisfaction, and tranquility. Overall, processual phenomena dominate the 
music. These aspects of music can be compared with discourse structures in 
language and dynamics in nature that are partly predictable and partly surprising. 
Language and music have similar spatial and temporal archetypes23 and are also 
similar in regions of contact and coordination within multimodal forms. Nevertheless, 
they differ fundamentally in the semiotic content, the material, and the creation and 
organization of meanings. 
3.6.2 
Semantic Constructions in Language and Music 
(Valences and Narrative Patterns) 
From the perspective of (linguistic) structuralism, the basic difference between music 
and language is that music is organized on a single layer. In this view, musical signs 
convey meaning without using a preparatory, basic level as phonology in language. 
Because musical meanings are not denotative, discrete, and organized in a lexicon, it 
does not make sense to project the grammatical levels (phoneme, morpheme, word, 
and sentence) of language into the realm of musical signs. However, the compar-
ison of the construction principles could be promising, although highly speculative. 
In Western tonality (since the Renaissance), one can identify examples of similar 
constructive principles in music and language. The musical model of tonal steps 
can be compared in its architecture with the valence steps in language. The corre-
late of the musical tonic (the basic tonal level) would be the nominative, which is 
often unmarked and stands in the intransitive sentence (valence 1); the dominant 
step in music or second most important (and most frequent) level correlates with the 
accusative case that is added in the transitive sentence (valence 2); the subdominant, 
or the third most important step in tonal music corresponds to the dative case.24 The 
dependency or dominance relations in music have an anchor in the natural musical 
scale, which is physically (and physiologically) based on the overtone series (cf.
23 “Archetype”, from Greek ¥ρχω “to begin”, means a form or behavior that existed already at the 
beginning of morphogenesis and remains relevant for further developments.

this chapter). In the case of language, valence has its natural foundations in event 
and action archetypes or basic scenarios such as locomotion (valence 1), action on 
an object/subject (valence 2), and a transaction in giving/taking (valence 3). The 
ontological basis is different; this corresponds to the different functions and modes 
of action of the two symbolic forms; however, the gradations in the basic patterns 
are comparable. This anchoring of symbolic systems in principles of nature (the 
phenomenal environment) can be described as archetypal (see Wildgen [41, 42]). 
Beyond these archetypes, a broad ﬁeld of contingent, context-dependent, and seem-
ingly random regularities exists. They form the arbitrariness that Saussure has placed 
at the center of his theory of language. 
The theory of music following the semiotics of A. Greimas sees in the narrative 
patterns the common denominator of language and music (cf. Tarasti [36]: 24–28 
and Grabócz [12]). However, the analysis of thematic, narrative structures in music 
relies heavily on comparing music with texts and the effect written texts have on 
the composer of a piece of music. First, the music composer may have written both 
operas and instrumental music so that one can infer the narrative content of similar 
instrumental passages from the narrative contents of the opera,second, literary models 
(dramas, novels, and poems) may have served the composer as a guideline. The 
narrative analysis of music depends on a historically given bond between literature 
and music. The narrative music analysis is pointless if the bond is weak or inexistent. 
Language and music can be traced back to more general patterns rooted in the semiotic 
ontology common to both symbolic forms. Cf. Chap. 7 for the analysis of a basic 
ontology of symbolic forms and semiosis. 
The temporal organization of music arises from the “refraction” (Schenker), i.e., 
the temporal unfolding of the static chord. The realization of latent harmonies in 
time creates a kind of “sound space–time” in which musicians and listeners move. In 
polyphonic music, different refractions appear side by side (ordered by the rules of 
counterpoint). The composition (in music) and the syntactical formation of sentences 
and texts in the (respective) language not only inherit the basic similarity of music 
and language but also incorporate speciﬁc conventions and inventions so that, at the 
surface, the correlation of music and speech is obscured. Nevertheless, in the creative 
design of music, i.e., in the composition of new musical works and of language art 
(in literary innovation), the fundamental structures and creative forces become again 
visible (cf. Wildgen [47]: part II for examples). 
3.7 
Musical Meaning and Context 
Musical meaning depends on the before and after of the musical event. However, this 
integration into the temporal events works differently than in language. Meaning in 
music is not built up in hierarchical and schematic constructions of elements, as is 
assumed for the morphology and syntax of a language. It is rather a kind of overlay, 
the addition of effects, the integration of local phenomena into larger wholes, and 
the emergence of a global meaning from many interacting forces.

The Morphogenesis of Symbolic Forms in Music
In addition to this narrow context, there is another concept of context related to 
discourse. In Foucault’s sense, discourse is a complex (“dispositif”) of various func-
tions, usually a heterogeneous structure that has emerged from various social condi-
tions and objectives and often reﬂects power relations. In music, the political compo-
nent has received great weight, especially in the context of the French Revolution. It 
“was about integrating music into the overall national concept” (Harnoncourt [16]: 
27). The “Conservatoire” undertook the task of coordinating national music educa-
tion. For this purpose, “everything that speaks—requires understanding—should be 
eliminated from music” (ibid.). This reorientation and the newly created institutions 
are still effective today and have partially erased the earlier traditions of musical 
education and thus caused a culture break in music history (ibid. 27f.). 
After the failed revolution in Germany in 1848, “romantic hopes faded,” and 
the realm of the aesthetic increasingly came to represent a retreat from life (arguably still 
a kind of political gesture). This moment coincided with Hanslick’s formalist agenda, and 
was followed by the Wagnerphil French symbolists’ search for hermetic poetry that would 
emulate music’s apparent disconnection from the everyday world of living (Clark [7]: 177). 
In the twentieth century, political measures were also against musical styles, such 
as the early rejection of jazz (ﬁrst in the USA, later in Europe), rock and pop music 
in the Eastern Bloc, and atonal music in the conservative European circles. In North 
Korea, Western music forms are banned, and the Taliban in Afghanistan do not want 
to tolerate such forms. Consequently, there must be a relationship between musical 
discourse and political/religious power. Music transports values that can promote a 
revolutionary change and transition (in the case of the French Revolution) or enter 
into conﬂict with the norms of a rigid, authoritarian, or religious rule. On the other 
hand, music may also be an escape from the insecurities of social and political 
developments and thus reduce the impact of historical contexts.

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic 
Forms (Art, Architecture, and Urban 
Structures) 
Abstract This chapter begins with a review of visual analysis methods since the 
twentieth century and the relevance of morphogenesis to it. The evolution of visual 
art points to morphogenetic principles already visible in Paleolithic “art”. Next, the 
morphogenetic analysis focuses on innovations in art since the Renaissance (with a 
focus on Leonardo a Vinci), the late modernity (William Turner, Henry Moore), and 
the twentieth century (Pollock and Joseph Beuys) with side-remarks on auto- and 
meta-reference in paintings by Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. In the remaining 
sections, visual artifacts beyond painting and sculpture, i.e., in architecture and urban 
design, are investigated regarding morphogenesis. 
4.1 
The Methods and Principles of a Morphogenetic 
Analysis of Visual Forms 
In overview, there are different levels of access to visible shapes and visual art:
• The micro-level (physiological and neural processes). It is the precondition for 
visual perception, imagination, and the corresponding memory. In the psychology 
of perception dealing with humans (and higher animals), tests and experiments 
on the behavior of human (and animal) subjects led to relevant insights. The work 
of Arnheim may stand for this tradition in the analysis of art (see [1] and the next 
section).
• The phenomenological level. On the one hand, visual communication builds on 
differences (values) in visual perception. On the other hand, it draws on historically 
created and changing conventions (rules of visual understanding). The comparison 
of recurring motifs in art history is a signiﬁcant access to the analysis of change and 
stability in the morphogenesis of art. The methods of iconography and iconology 
are a response to this demand. We shall discuss these theoretical enterprises in a 
second section.

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
4.1.1 
Gestalt Principles of Visual Art After Arnheim 
The basic principles of gestalt psychology, developed particularly in the experimen-
tally oriented Berlin school (Wertheimer, Köhler, Koffka), were the basis for Rudolf 
Arnheim’s psychological work on visual art.1 His book: Art and Visual Perception: 
A Psychology of the Creative Eye (1954) made him famous. As the title suggests, 
seeing is an active process in which the eye/brain generates patterns based on light 
stimuli. These creatively developed shapes result from a morphogenetic process. It 
involves the organs of sight and reacts to the affordances of the visual environment. 
The active involvement of the cognitive system becomes particularly clear in the case 
of hallucinations, the completion of incomplete forms (Kanizsa contours), and the 
attribution of causal relationships. Two principles emphasized by Rudolf Arnheim 
will be applied in the analysis of Leonardo’s “The Last Supper”: 
(a) 
The Principle of Centrality. Every scene and every image is broken down into 
a center of visual attention and an associated periphery. In the case of framed 
pictures, this center depends on the frame’s shape (rectangular, quadratic, or 
round). In addition, sub-centers that are visited longer or more frequently by 
eye saccades can be detected, and transition zones between different sub-centers 
can be marked. This way, the visual ﬁeld is structured depending on a speciﬁc 
viewing time. Various directions away from the center (like up-down, left–right) 
can also be highlighted and contribute to the meaning of paintings. 
(b) The Force Fields. Rudolf Arnheim, like James Gibson, emphasizes the dynamic 
character of visual perception. Thus, a static rectangle that is white (empty) can 
be understood as a force ﬁeld determined by the diagonals on the one hand and 
the center vectors on the other. The latter is related to the above principle; the 
former results in movement to the corners and left–right asymmetry if one of 
the diagonals dominates in the image. Overall, the image ﬁeld is formally a 
visual vector ﬁeld into which the speciﬁc movements of the visual attention are 
inserted and adapted depending on the shapes or colors. 
Overall, there is a layered level structure of visual perception. First, there are 
the physical stimuli such as contours, gradients of brightness, colors, and surfaces; 
secondly, gestalt processes in perception take place that constructively change, 
supplement, and ﬁll out these stimuli. Thirdly, there is the attribution of meaning, 
which builds on these perceptual results. Finally, existing memory patterns or 
biographical (indirectly also historical) experiences can be modiﬁed and inserted 
into a larger context. The Berlin School of Gestalt Psychology, Gibson’s research, 
and modern neuro-vision research have shown that the ﬁrst two levels can be assessed
1 He studied psychology (regarding art) in Berlin and received his doctorate in 1928 with a thesis 
on the expressive behavior of human faces and hand movements. He was interested in ﬁlm from 
an early age (in Rome until 1939). After immigrating to the USA, he was ﬁrst appointed by the 
Guggenheim Foundation commissioned to research the contribution of Gestalt psychology to art 
science. He then taught art psychology at various American universities until old age. Cf. for an 
overview Verstegen [32].

using experimental methods. The memory component is the proper realm of symbolic 
forms, although it already plays a role on the second level. 
4.1.2 
Visual Art as Symbolic Form; The Impact 
of Iconography and Iconology 
In Hamburg, Cassirer had good contacts with the Warburg circle and Aby Warburg’s 
cultural studies. In various writings, especially towards the end of his life, he regards 
art as a particular symbolic form. It is a language of intuitive symbols without the 
abstract categorization typical of natural languages and its segmental-sequential orga-
nization (cf. Cassirer [7]: 152f.). The art-historical dimension of Cassirer’s philos-
ophy was expanded in particular by Erwin Panofsky and Fritz Saxl. Panofsky distin-
guished three levels of meaning in the visual arts (cf. Panofsky [26]: 32ff). The ﬁrst 
two relate to the subject (for instance, in a picture). A distinction is made between 
the primary or natural subject and the secondary or conventional subject. The former 
concerns lines and forms and recognizable natural objects such as houses, animals, 
relationships, movement forms, and properties. The second type of subject identi-
ﬁes people or things based on conventionally assigned characteristics. For example, 
in a picture, there is a male ﬁgure with a knife (primary subject),this conﬁguration 
refers to St. Bartholomew (secondary subject). To be able to identify the secondary 
subject, the viewers must be familiar not only with the pictorial tradition but also with 
literary traditions. Only then can they “read” the secondary meaning. The third type 
of meaning is the “actual meaning or content” (ibid. 40). In it, an author condenses 
the principles or perspectives of his epoch, society, and social environment. “The 
discovery and interpretation of these ‘symbolic’ values (…) is the subject of what 
we, in contrast to ‘iconography’, can call ‘iconology’” (ibid. 41). One can say that 
the iconographic analysis is the empirically justiﬁable part of the analysis of a work 
of art. The iconological is the theoretical part that proposes possible connections and 
regularities of a more extensive range. 
4.1.3 
Further Methods of Visual Analysis 
in a Morphogenetic Perspective 
Kress and van Leeuwen [15] introduce three interconnected systems of meaning 
creation in visual artifacts: 
1. Information value. Different zones of the picture are associated with speciﬁc 
valences, e.g., left (less)–right (more) or up (desire, ideal)–below (real), central– 
peripheral (different information values in Asian culture) (cf. ibid. Chap. 6). 
2. Salience. It is realized by qualities such as foreground versus background, relative 
size, a contrast in brightness or color, and differences in sharpness (ibid. 183).

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
3. Framing. Visible frames or dividing lines can connect or separate, indicating that 
certain contents are related or unrelated. 
These criteria elaborate on basic principles already mentioned by Arnheim but 
speciﬁed in the perspective of social semiotics, i.e., the meanings contained in visual 
art and design due to social contexts and speciﬁc applications (for instance, in journals 
and advertisements). 
Jean Petitot introduced the notion of non-genericity (or instability under varia-
tion) as a correlate of aesthetic quality. He speaks (Petitot [30]: 57) of signiﬁcant 
and pertinent (spatial, temporal) structures marked by non-genericity. This morpho-
logical information serves as a basis for interpretative processes and thus constitutes 
a morphology of meaning (“morphologie du sens”; cf. Petitot [29], Brandt [2], and 
Bundgaard [4]).2 Leyton [18] also addresses the dimension of the meaning of lines 
and curves in the context of his mathematical psychology. Several of these adven-
tures into visual aesthetics will be used or referred to in the remaining sections of 
this chapter. In the morphogenetic analysis of visual art, the origins of this symbolic 
form must be the grounding ﬂoor. 
4.2 
The Origins of Visual Artifacts and Art 
The beginning of graphic arts can be dated from the ﬁrst appearance of concentrated 
color pigments around hominid sites. Barham (2001) reports that hematite (iron 
compounds often referred to as ocher) was recovered from a deposit near the Twin 
Rivers in Zambia. The pieces of hematite had been brought to the site, processed 
there, and rubbed on surfaces. One can conclude that these materials were used to 
color bodies or surfaces. Using such pigments points to a continuity that extends from 
the aforementioned archaeological sites (around 270,000 years BP) to contemporary 
hunter-gatherer cultures in the Kalahari. It is highly probable that the early Homo 
sapiens also used these (and other) colors to paint their bodies, objects, or wall 
surfaces. A larger body of paintings, line drawings, and sculptures did not appear 
until the later Stone Age (Palaeolithic), and the following discussion will focus on 
these products. Three types of ﬁgural symbolism (“art”) can e distinguished: (1) 
Engravings on tools, (2) portable art (ﬁgurines) and sculptures, and (3) partially 
colored paintings in caves. 
Ad 1: The ﬁrst incised drawings on the stone were found in Africa and can be dated 
back to 70,000 years BP. One can distinguish between self-contained, mainly deco-
rative forms, and iconic art, which refers to objects, animals, etc., through realistic 
contours and colors. 
Ad 2: Palaeolithic sculptures. These sculptures are primarily small, like the famous 
“Venus statuettes” in many places in Europe and Western Asia. They generally
2 Verstegen [33] sketched the consequences of the new paradigm, “dynamic semiotics”, for visual 
analysis are. Caliandro [5] described some applications of the morphodynamic paradigm in the 
analysis of visual art.

emphasize the woman’s sexual attributes. Other sculptures (e.g., of animals) are 
very realistic, such as the clay bison sculptures in the cave of Tuc d’Audoubet (cf. 
Leakey [16]: 174). The sculpture can even be a decoration on a weapon or ritual 
instrument. 
Ad 3: Cave paintings occur primarily in an area north and west of the Pyrenees, 
e.g., in Périgord, Toulouse (France), and the Cantabrian provinces of Spain.3 Together 
with the ﬁnds of sculptures in southern Germany and the Danube countries, they 
point to a cultural network south of the ice masses with a corridor between the 
northern European icy areas and the Alpine glaciers, i.e., from northern Spain to 
southern Russia. The herds of grazing animals that moved seasonally between the 
higher (colder) and lower (warmer) regions determined the lives of humans (and 
other carnivores who competed with them). One can compare the ecology of these 
cultures to reindeer cultures in northern Finland and northern Siberia today. The 
cultural contacts and the ecological basis of survival probably led to a shared (or at 
least similar) system of beliefs, myths, and rituals of which the cave paintings are an 
expression. The peak of cave painting extends from the end of the Aurignacian to the 
middle Magdalenian (around 16,000 years BP); this tradition was lost rather quickly 
towards the end of this period. In the decline of this culture, the images became 
smaller and were reduced to outlines and sketches. 
The engravings (see 1) and paintings (see 3) were also simpliﬁed to symbols 
without iconic support. To those who used the cave, the meaning was known, but 
to those who did not take part in the ritual, they looked like actual ciphers from an 
unknown alphabet. Since we know that writing systems are more recent phenomena, 
we must interpret these symbols as memory-supporting notations. Even before a 
system of writing was introduced, and with it a corpus of knowledge held at the 
disposal of persons in prominent social positions, cultural knowledge has been a 
socially codiﬁed system of signs, anticipating later graphic modes of codiﬁcation. 
After this step, cultural evolution could reach a level of organization that made writing 
possible and proﬁtable. It only needed to be invented and further developed through 
its use. 
Utility art and ritually integrated art form a continuum of forms. The so-called hand 
axes represent the ﬁrst stage of development. It was perhaps preceded by a phase 
in which found objects (branches, bones, stones) were selected and only roughly 
prepared. With the ﬁrst systematically manufactured stones (e.g., in Villefranchien, 
approx. 2 million years BP), the implementation of a traditional idea of form begins. 
It led to the serial production of objects (and preﬁgures technical innovations in the 
industrial revolution). Since hand axes were used both as weapons and for cutting 
and scraping, they partially replaced the function of teeth in other animals. In a way, 
hand axes are representations of canines (on the tip) or rows of teeth (on the tapered 
sides). These evolutionary aspects are further developed in Wildgen [35, 36].
3 However, there are also sites in the southern Urals. Similar paintings in northern zones may have 
been chipped off by frost and disappeared into the rubble. Since some regions have no calcareous 
cavities, it is reasonable to admit that they may have existed in all Ice Age areas inhabited by 
modern humans. Recently cave paintings were discovered in Borneo. Therefore, it is plausible that 
they were a common feature of human culture in the migration inside and outside Africa.

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
The morphogenetic “germ” of Paleolithic art developed further in Egypt, 
Mesopotamia, the Minoan culture, and Greek antiquity. Finally, this high point of 
civilization was rediscovered and continued in the Renaissance. Therefore, we start 
with an analysis of the art and theory of art in Leonardo da Vinci; cf. for a more 
detailed analysis Wildgen [37], in French; [39], in English, and [41], in German. 
4.3 
Morphogenesis and Visual Art: From Leonardo da 
Vinci to William J. M. Turner and Henry Moore 
At ﬁrst sight, these two ﬁelds, morphogenesis and visual art, seem to have no common 
ground. Biological morphogenesis applies basic physical and physiological princi-
ples. One could say its realm is the physical world, “res extensa” in Descartes’ terms. 
On the other hand, culture, media, and the arts are often considered abstract, if not 
spiritual. They are referred to as “res cogitans” in a Cartesian ontology. They seem 
to have no real-world substratum, to be non-accessible to scientiﬁc methods like 
measurement, experiment, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling. 
Contrary to Cartesian metaphysics and inspired by René Thom’s epistemology, 
we assume an interaction between biological entities, e.g., human beings, and ecolo-
gies, mainly the living environment (“Lebenswelt”). Complex living systems have a 
kind of systemic telicity, i.e., a goal orientation. In its ﬁght for survival, the organism 
creates stability and a projection into a possible future. To a certain extent, it can 
choose and channel possible evolutions, modify its life context, and thus avoid selec-
tive pressures. This telic dimension is the background of consciousness, which aims 
to control the interaction of humans with their environment. Rational strategies are 
the outcome of this trend. However, their impact is limited to lacunas of determinism 
left by more potent factors, which govern the overall evolution of the system. Art 
is also telic and applies principles of rationality (e.g., minimal means for maximal 
efﬁciency). However, its proper realm is intuitive creativity, which enables the appear-
ance of new, astonishing shapes, constructions, and contents. In many instances, it 
overthrows established habits. It contradicts the rules of art academies (e.g., in the 
nineteenth century) and reacts to sudden political and societal shifts (e.g., after wars 
and economic crises). We shall present three case studies on Leonardo da Vinci, 
William J. M. Turner, and Henry Moore. They may stand for consecutive periods of 
morphogenesis in visual art: Renaissance (ﬁfteenth and sixteenth century), the begin-
nings of impressionistic and expressionistic visual art (nineteenth century), and the 
twentieth-century shift to abstract forms. In a later section, avant-garde artists like 
Pollock and Beuys shall be dealt with separately.

4.3.1 
Morphogenetic Structures in the Art of Leonardo da 
Vinci 
In his “Trattato della pittura”, Leonardo states that painters have as their primary aim 
the representation of two things: man and his mind (“l’uomo e la mente”; Pedretti 
[28]: § 180). The nature of man becomes visible and, therefore, accessible to the eye 
in the different “accidents” and movements and the proportions of his body parts 
(cf. Pedretti [28]: Terza Parte). To represent man and his mind, the artists must ﬁrst 
create an appropriate pictorial space, the stage for the topic of the painting. Second, 
they must consider light and shadow on human bodies, the gestures of the hands, 
the postures of the head, and facial expressions. After that, they can distribute the 
topics of the painting on the surface. Finally, the landscape, sky, objects, animals, 
and persons accompanying the subject of the artwork must be arranged in space 
relative to light and shadow. Leonardo’s art goes beyond the mimesis of nature; it 
manifests the meaning of space, light, and shadows in human experience. It displays 
the dramatic relations between persons and their embedding into the scenery (land-
scape, architecture, or the interior of houses). The beauty of a scene is the recovered 
meaning in the viewer’s mind, the interpreter. Based on his experience, movement, 
and action, he must extrapolate from a static picture to a process that has caused the 
action and will bring it to a proper end later. In bodily movement, the dynamics of 
one body part have a counterpoise in another body part. The terms balance, weight, 
and counterpoise have the following meaning in the context of painting: A single 
body is in balance if the weight of the movement of one part of the body, e.g., the 
head, has a counterpoise in another, e.g., in the direction of the shoulders or the 
trunk. The balance could be easily realized if all bodies or body parts were static. 
However, this would make them appear “wooden”, i.e., unanimated. The painter who 
wants to show the mind of the persons in the scene must show them in a dynamic 
balance. This objective means that, for Leonardo, natural dynamics is the source of 
bodily dynamics and, ﬁnally, the dynamics of the mind. Therefore, it has to start from 
the physics of objects, and bodies in space/time, resulting in the morphogenesis of 
meaning in a symbolic space. This morphogenesis differs depending on the kind of 
experience based on the human senses and their cognitive processing. Therefore, it 
is different for musical, visual, mythical meanings, and others. In the following, two 
paintings of Leonardo are analyzed: “The Lord’s Supper” and “St. Anne with the 
virgin and the child” (for further details, cf. Wildgen [41], in German and [37], in 
French, where the pictorial traditions before and after Leonardo and his sketches in 
the preparation of the paintings are included in the analysis). 
The topic of “The Lord’s Supper” has been traditional in Christian art since the 
second millennium (cf. Wildgen [36]). The spatial framework of the painting is 
deﬁned in terms of linear perspective. It creates the illusion of a deep hall with a 
rectangular tapestry on the sides and three openings going into a landscape in the 
background. The linear perspective has its origin in the head of Christ. The central 
point, Jesus’ ear, is signiﬁcantly related to the narrative content. Jesus has just uttered 
the prophecy that one of his disciples will betray him, and at the moment captured by

(Wikipedia commons) 
the painting, he is listening to their answers.4 His head is slightly displaced from the 
center of the door in the background, which relieves his face against the landscape. 
The upper border of the landscape deﬁnes a line on which the eyes of Christ are 
placed. Thus, the position of the central person in space is precisely calculated to 
match the geometrical and semantic centrality of the ﬁgure. 
The geometrical arrangement of the thirteen actors in the scene has a fundamental 
symmetry—Christ versus twelve apostles, six sitting to his left, six to his right. The 
linear arrangement, which includes Judas, the traitor, is new. Most paintings, which 
treated the same topic before, have put Judas on the other side of the table such that 
he turns his back to the viewer (Fig. 4.1). 
The morphogenetic organization follows basic laws of pictorial space, such as the 
laws of perspective discovered in the early Renaissance. In addition, it includes the 
model of regular polygons and polyhedra and the rules of symmetry. For example, in 
one of the preliminary sketches, John is resting his head on the table; the grouping of 
the remaining apostles on Christ’s left is two plus three. On his right the grouping is 
one (Peter) plus two plus two. Leonardo restructures this scene to obtain geometrical 
symmetry, which may be expressed arithmetically: 13 = 3 + 3 + 1 (Christ)  + 3 + 
3. 
In comparison with this order, we may observe that Giotto (1266–1336) painted his 
“Lord’s Supper” with a signiﬁcant non-homogenous group of three: Christ, John, and 
Judas on the opposite side of the table plus two groups of ﬁve apostles. The arithmetic 
order is 13 = 5 + 3 + 5. Ghirlandajo (1449–1494) also adopts the central group of 
three persons, but he subdivides the ﬁve persons to the left. Leonardo’s proportions 
are new concerning the tradition, and they deﬁne a new cognitive or image-schematic

est” and that Christ, at this moment, accepts the beginning of his martyrdom.

65
model, which introduces a new reading of the biblical story. Indirectly, his narrative 
interprets society and the relation in a human group (a family, a group of friends, a 
group of professionals, a political party with its leader, etc.). Therefore, Leonardo’s 
organization of the topic creates a new frame of interpretation applicable to spiritual 
life and political and everyday affairs. In this sense, it can serve as background 
knowledge for innumerable communication situations. It is responsible for a piece 
of art’s human and social relevance beyond its aesthetic function. Similar effects 
in modern media are analyzed in the case of “social semiotics”; cf. Kress and van 
Leeuven [15]. 
The utterance of Christ: “One of you will betray me”, is a force, the effect of 
which makes a visible and emotional impact on the apostles. Like a shock wave, it 
hits most strongly the two groups sitting directly to the right and left of Christ and, 
to a lesser degree, the exterior groups. If we consider the nearer groups, James is 
pushed back, whereas John stays calm, although displaced relatively to Christ, and 
Judas is insensitive to the force emanating from Christ. He uses this moment to grasp 
the bread. These two groups are more agitated than the calmer outer groups. Thus, 
the dynamic effect of the words of Christ is represented as a wave with repercussions 
and vortices. If we analyze the single groups of apostles, their postures, and gestures, 
we can further decompose all four groups of apostles into two plus one (center). The 
central person neutralizes and stops the movement issued from Jesus and thus brings 
it to rest, the natural locus of motion in Aristotle’s physics. It is as if the blow of the 
utterance had dynamically shaped the four groups and their subgroups. As a result 
of the impact, the grouping seems to be the natural consequence of the underlying 
dynamics. Judas is separated from the other apostles in his dynamics. He appears to 
be lost for any positive effect, holds his money in his right hand, and stops grasping 
for a moment at the bread. He shows a closed, sinister face which is in complete 
contrast to the face of John illuminated by the light from the left. 
Leonardo tries to organize his composition to show the force’s origin, its imme-
diate effects, and the multiple structures created by the percussions of the power 
which came from Jesus. As the central force’s emotional and intellectual effects are 
the painting’s main topic, Leonardo reorganizes the scene’s geometry to arrive at an 
optimal representation of the forces and their effects on body postures, gestures, and 
facial expressions. 
The semiotic revolution in Leonardo’s painting preﬁgures the scientiﬁc revolu-
tion announced in Copernicus’ De revolutionibus orbium (1543) and brought to the 
summit in the work of Galileo and Kepler. Together with other intellectual and reli-
gious changes, they remodeled the common knowledge, the worldview of educated 
people in the sixteenth century, and Western civilization in the following centuries. 
The content of the painting emerges via an analysis of the natural physical and ﬂuid 
dynamics. Leonardo can organize the semiogenesis of his mural painting in close 
relationship to the natural dynamics. It becomes a kind of “map” of the main contents 
of Christianism. It goes beyond religious standards in the second millennium and 
can code a universal human message. 
The second painting, “St. Anne with the virgin and the child”, belongs to the late 
period; Leonardo brought it to France towards the end of his life; it is now one of

the treasure pieces of the Louvre in Paris. In its center is the mother of Jesus, Mary, 
and her mother, Anne. Both care for the infant Jesus on their knees. In the chapter 
on myth and religion (Chap. 5 of this book), Mary is the second major attractor of 
Christianism. Thus, the two paintings analyzed here are like an introduction to the 
mythical message of Christianism (Fig. 4.2). 
In the painting by Leonardo, three persons: St. Anne, Mary, and Jesus (of different 
ages and sexes), are readily identiﬁable as essential topics. Moreover, from the Bible, 
we know that there is a kinship relation: Anne—mother of—Mary—mother of — 
Jesus (by transitivity, we know that Anne is the grandmother of Jesus, by inversion 
that Jesus is the son of Mary and Mary the daughter of Anne). This knowledge level 
already constitutes a second space related to the purely visual space that we construe 
as we look at the painting: 
Anne—background to—Mary—background to—Jesus 
Anne’s head—above—Mary’s head—above—Jesus’ head 
Anne—looks older than—Mary—looks more aged than—Jesus 
Anne—supports—Mary—helps—Jesus. 
Anne and Mary form one group (by proximity), and Jesus and the lamb another.5 
5 The colors help to complete the visual map. For example, in Leonardo’s painting, both mother and 
daughter have a green mantle, and Mary can be seen to wear a red robe; both are subsumed under

The painting contains a rich geometric and dynamic structure (weights, bar 
centers, force lines, and gaze directions) used in many of Leonardo’s works. A static 
representation would be insufﬁcient for the painting’s pictorial and narrative aims. 
Furthermore, this piece is typical of the concept of dynamic valence.6 
In the case of this painting, we have on the surface a quaternary constellation: 
Anne–Mary–Jesus–lamb. Considering the force ﬁelds and actions, one notices that 
a primary interaction links: Mary–Jesus–the lamb.
• Mary pulls on Jesus
• Jesus pulls on the lamb
• The lamb resists
• Jesus resists being pulled away from the lamb. 
There is a conﬂict between Mary, who tries to prevent Jesus from seizing the 
lamb, and Jesus, who notices this (he looks back at her) but resists her action. This 
triad constitutes a force ﬁeld, which dominates the message of the painting. A ﬁrst 
schematic representation introduces two vector ﬁelds with attractors: 
Mary
Jesus 
lamb 
Jesus is in the metastable position between two attractors; the narrative (biblical) 
content of these attractors is.
• Mary: His mother. She cares for her child.
• Jesus: He feels the duty to sacriﬁce and to leave Mary behind. 
The cognitive dynamics lying at the heart of the two paintings by Leonardo may 
be described in the context of dynamical semiotics (cf. Wildgen [34]: 68–72). The 
constellation of forces between Mary–Christ–the lamb corresponds to the funda-
mental dynamic schema of transfer (cf. Sects. 1.4 and 6.6 in this book or Wildgen 
[34]: 69–72). 
As the schema of transfer does not describe all the interactions in the pictorial 
composition, one has to consider two elaborations:
• Anne supports/anchors the whole event (physically and genealogically). She is a 
fourth attractor, sustaining the event on her knees.
• The manner of “transfer” is further elaborated in the painting and could be 
described in a sentence such as Mary trying to prevent Jesus from seizing the 
lamb. This sentence goes augmented by a modal verb (try to) beyond the elemen-
tary schema derived from catastrophe theory (cf. Brandt [2] for an analysis of 
modality in terms of catastrophe theory).
the color opposition: red-green. The lamb is a symbol of the sacriﬁce of Jesus and an attribute of 
John (Baptist). 
6 Peirce was the ﬁrst to propose a general scheme on this level of abstraction. His monads, dyads 
and triads are considered as dynamical wholes not reducible by simple composition. 

68

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
In the painting, one sees Mary’s hands seizing Jesus and the hands (and feet) of 
Jesus holding the lamb, and we see that Jesus has a ﬁrmer grip on the lamb than 
Mary. This is because turning his head opposes the force direction of Mary’s hands. 
One could further distinguish two levels:
• An interpretation based on everyday experience with human interaction.
• An interpretation linked to the Bible. 
The distinction between the two levels of analysis is natural because in real-
life situations, i.e., when one observes a mother interacting with her child, the ﬁrst 
interpretation suggests itself. In cultural traditions that have elaborated a collective 
visual or linguistic memory (e.g., of primary biblical contents), the second interpre-
tation is superimposed on the routines of the ﬁrst one. It is typical of art to presup-
pose cultural knowledge and special “reading”-skills; i.e., the meanings go beyond 
everyday experience and are rooted in knowledge, the second pillar of semiotics (cf. 
Chap. 7). 
4.3.2 
The Morphogenesis of Abstract Painting in William 
J. M. Turner 
Natural scenes and even actors may fade from sight, e.g., a landscape in fog or the 
transition to darkness. A person under similar conditions disappears also; in other 
circumstances, the viewer is only allowed a short glimpse, as when passing by on a 
train. Reduced visual cues are not necessarily abstract but may be accurate. Another 
example of abstract perception occurring in real vision may be found in cases in 
which people half-perceive or only implicitly perceive objects which appear in a 
repetitive or monotonous context. Examples are the telephone poles at the side of 
the road on a long car trip, the furniture of a room one passes through daily, and so 
on. Although viewers have the physical ability to perceive the whole situation in a 
precise manner, they largely ignore the multitude of details and pick up one or two 
speciﬁc features. In the same way, the artist may prefer to neglect all foreseeable 
and general characteristics. This process is analyzed in some paintings by William 
Turner. 
William Turner (1775–1851) stands in the tradition of British landscape painting. 
Around the ﬁrst half of the eighteenth century, aristocratic families practiced sending 
their young men on a “Grand Tour” to visit Europe and Italy. Paintings of scenes 
encountered on tour, mainly in the dominant Italian style, were brought home as 
souvenirs. However, painters like Wilson, Gainsborough, Wright of Derby, Cotman, 
Girtin, and others, departed from this tradition, and Turner radicalized the move 
against topographical preciseness (cf. Meyer [21]. 
The loss of referential distinctiveness and the neglect of identiﬁcation of speciﬁc 
objects, cities, and landscapes may have been motivated by Turner’s preference for 
vague surfaces under speciﬁc (natural) conditions. He felt uncomfortable working

with his materials out of doors and preferred a more economical or even minimalist 
method. For example, in a painting of the Castle of Chillon at the lake of Geneva 
from 1809 (British Museum), a precise representation with persons in the foreground, 
buildings, the lakeshore, and mountains is given. However, in a watercolor painting 
from 1841, the same lake of Geneva is depicted in a very vague fashion (Fig. 4.3). 
In the second painting (see above), one can still recognize mountains, the shore 
of the lake, the water surface (blue), ships, and possibly people, but the symphony of 
colors, the transitions between surfaces, and indirectly the emotional values become 
dominant. Some later paintings reﬂect very speciﬁc, rare, and traditionally not repre-
sented phenomena such as “Snowstorm–Steamboat off a harbor’s mouth making 
signals in shallow water, and going by the lead”. 
Turner gave this accurate description to avoid an interpretation of the picture as 
fantasy or caprice. In a certain sense, some of these paintings are even more realistic 
than those by Leonardo because they refer to concrete, personal perceptions of the 
painter. Their objects refer to geographically and historically distinct entities which 
can be identiﬁed as parts of the context of the painter’s life, episodes of his journeys, 
and situations observed and remembered. This subjectivity refers to the life and the 
body of the author. It is probably the new message which made Turner a precursor 
of the impressionistic style in the eyes of later generations. 
The next section will follow this line, which became dominant in the artistic 
directions of Expressionism and Cubism. The work of Picasso could be a good 
example, but the strategy followed is even more apparent in the sculptures (and 
sketches for sculptures) of Henry Moore.7 In 1932, Henry Moore met Pablo Picasso,8 
Jean Arp, and other modern artists in Paris; in 1936, he joined o group of surrealists

in London and began to produce abstract sculptures. However, the sculptures of the 
Swiss poet, painter, and sculptor Jean Arp (1886–1966) were already oriented toward 
biotic, natural forms, as shown in Fig. 4.4 
4.3.3 
Abstractive Reduction of Human Body Postures 
in Henry Moore’s Sculptures 
To restrict the scope of the analysis, we only consider the “Reclining Figure” topic, 
which is frequent in Moore’s oeuvre. In a crayon drawing (“Reclining Nude”, red 
and black crayon, ca. 1923; cf. Moore [24]: 96), Moore shows a realistic picture of 
a “Reclining Nude”, a drawing from 1933 shows a series of projected sculptures on 
the same topic. Even if single parts of the sculptures may be recognized as belonging 
to a human body in a reclining position, these ﬁgures are like an exercise for variable 
shapes of persons in the given pose. What is left is the horizontality, the partial 
suspension (and support) of the body characteristic of a reclining posture (cf. Moore 
[24]: 112). 
Henry Moore became famous for his large sculptures, many resembling human 
bodies, but some lack any referential support. In Fig. 4.5, one of many variants of 
Henry Moore’s treatment of the topic in sculptures is presented and used for further 
analysis.
The head is a mass in the normal position (above the shoulders), and the direction 
the head is facing is distinguishable. Everything else: hair, ears, eyes, mouth is absent. 
The sharp frontal line on the “head” could be a generalization of the nose. The

oversized extremities (feet) may be associated with the shape of covered knees in a 
reclining ﬁgure, and the large mass at the end could be a long cloth covering the open 
legs (cf. the drawings from 1948 in Moore’s “Shelter Sketchbook”, cf. Moore [24]: 
151). The result of this “abstraction” can be explained by a series of transformations, 
which are visually reconstructed by the viewers as soon as they know the topic of 
the sculpture. 
What is the prototype of a draped lying woman? The most straightforward scheme 
is one of two masses: 
Mass 1: (head, trunk, arms)–mass 2: (legs)—transitory zone: back. 
The transition zone is the most challenging part of the composition; it can be 
a sphere (maximally curved)—a bent cylinder (moderately curved)—or a regular 
solid, e.g., a pyramid, a cube, etc. All these solutions are at least implied in Moore’s 
sculptures. Figure 4.6 gives an idea of possible compositions.
The narrative content of a “Reclining Figure” is concentrated in the verb: to lie, 
with its linguistic neighbors: lie down, sit down, and stand up, rise. The viewer of the 
sculpture may mentally add in masses for the head, shoulders, arms, elbows, knees, 
legs, feet, hair, eyes, nose, and mouth. He thus goes back on a path of abstraction

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
Fig. 4.6 Reducing the “Reclining Figure” to a cylinder, sphere, and (curved) pyramid
analog to that taken by the sculptor himself (or even engages in a longer “story” of 
artistic development). It may be understood as the trajectory from a prototype (or a 
set of prototypes) to our visual representation of a particular human body. Thus, the 
sculpture represents this cognitive itinerary (cf. Leyton [17]). 
A more radical visual analysis of the human body destroys its unitary gestalt, its 
topological coherence. Two trajectories may be observed in Moore’s oeuvre:
• Instead of one body (from head to feet and hands), several sculptural entities which 
together “represent” the “Reclining Figure” are used. Moore distinguishes two-
piece, three-piece, and four-piece reclining ﬁgures.9 The geometrical analysis is 
shown in Fig. 4.6 is insufﬁcient to cover all the variants of the topic. Still, if one 
adds curved (and conical) cylinders, spheres with excavations, and bent cylinders, 
then most of the forms may be classiﬁed on this basis. The bending of lines, the 
curves, and the concave or convex surfaces refer more speciﬁcally to the realm of 
biological entities.
• Beyond convex and concave limbs and surfaces, one can observe gaps. They may 
appear in a reclining ﬁgure, e.g., between arm and body, or arms and legs, and 
the support.10 
• In other sculptures, the title of the sculpture abandons the reference to human 
bodies, as in: “Three rings, 1966–67” (Moore [23]: Nr. 74). 
Instead of continuous (differentiable) curves, sharp edges (“knife-edge”), pikes, 
and strings attached to bodies appear. The combination of smooth surfaces, knife 
edges, and pikes is illustrated in the sculpture: “Three points 1939–0” cf. Moore 
([23]: 45, Nr. 37).
9 In Moore [22], examples are shown in Nr. 10 (one-piece), Nr. 11 (two-piece), and Nr. 40/41 (three-
piece); the four-piece composition (Nr. 86) is not called “reclining ﬁgure” but visibly belongs to 
the same family of sculptures. 
10 Cf. Moore [23]: Nr. 68, 71 “Reclining Fig. 1939”, Nr. 73 “Reclining ﬁgure (external form) 
1953–54”.

4.4 Secondary Morphogenesis or “Meta-representation” in Art
73
4.3.4 
Conclusion 
Innovations in art history are more than temporary changes in taste or dominance 
shifts in schools’ rivalry. They contain at their heart a “problem” and its “solution” by 
the artist. This feature has been shown in the case of Leonardo. The arrangement and 
the postures in the “Lord’s Supper” contribute to the visualization of the dynamics 
inherent in the narrative episode represented in the fresco. In the series of works 
dedicated to the triad of St. Anne, Mary, and Jesus, a dynamic conﬁguration with 
attractors, repellors, forces, weights, and counterpoises is visually organized together 
with a system of view lines. The case studies of Turner and Moore showed the natural 
process of symbolic abstraction in landscape painting (Turner) and ﬁgural sculpture 
(Moore) and the directions of their gradual development in the artists’ oeuvre. The 
activity of the artists is a kind of artiﬁcial morphogenesis. It applies natural dynamic 
schemata known from nature and thus gives genuine meaning to the artifacts created. 
The viewers can recover these meanings due to their own experience with nature and 
the fact that they are also part of this nature. 
4.4 
Secondary Morphogenesis or “Meta-representation” 
in Art 
The label “meta-representation in art” has at least two content levels of representation 
(cf. Wildgen [38] for more details). First, it can be shown in the case of a classical 
painting by Diego da Silva y Velasquez (1599–1660), “Las Meninas”. This famous 
painting by Velasquez is discussed extensively by Foucault in the ﬁrst pages of his 
book: “Les mots et les choses” Foucault [9]. It is shown together with one (of several) 
meta-referential paintings by Pablo Picasso in Fig. 4.7.
In the original picture by Velasquez, we can ﬁnd at least three parties looking at 
the scene, which is the central concern of the painting, i.e., the princess escorted by 
her ladies on the left and right and accompanied by two dwarfs and a dog. The person 
standing behind the door and looking at the scene looks simultaneously at the king 
and the queen. They appear in the mirror and are thus only represented indirectly 
(and with side inversion). The painter, Velasquez himself, also looks at the monarch 
pausing his work for a moment. One may infer that, when he continues his work in 
one moment, he will again look at the scene with the Meninas and his painting. As 
he is probably not painting the back of the princess, she and her environment must 
turn around to continue this painting session. It is evident that the painting on which 
he is working is not the one we see, but one where either the princess is represented 
or a different one. In this case, the visit of the princess would be accidental. 
Picasso’s painting reproduces Velasquez’s painting under deformations (58 paint-
ings on canvas were created between August and May 1957 in Cannes). Instead of 
starting from a real-world situation like Velasquez (even if it is challenging to infer 
the details of this situation), Picasso takes the famous painting as his starting point,

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
Fig. 4.7 Las Meninas by Velasquez (Museo Nacional del Prado) and one (of 58) meta-referential 
paintings by Pablo Picasso (Museo Picasso, Barcelona) (Wikipedia and Wikiart common)
creating a whole series of cubistic reinterpretations of this painting. His art is meta-
representative because the viewer can guess the original topic and focus on Picasso’s 
metamorphosis of the subject and his visual comments on it. Moreover, Picasso’s 
characteristic style is a signature of his presence in the artwork. 
In Velasquez’s painting, the mirror plays a signiﬁcant role. This meta-effect can be 
enforced not only in the painter’s self-portraits but can also be recursively applied. A 
good example is the painting by Salvador Dali’s (uncompleted) stereoscopic painting 
“Dali de dos poignant Gala de dos” which shows Dali seen from behind looking at his 
wife, Gala, who sits in front of a mirror. Both are shown from behind and in front (in 
the mirror) (Figueras, Fundacion Gala-Salvador Dali; cf. Descharnes and Néret [8]: 
201). The action of the mirror could be repeated whereby the painter and his model 
would appear not only twice but three, four, and many times. As in the case of video 
feedback, repeated mirroring can have a chaotic attractor and destroy the original 
input, resulting in fractal patterns analyzed by Benoît Mandelbrot (1924–2010).

Fractal Art in Pollock and Art as Social Sculpture 
and Diagram in Beuys 
The last section has shown that meta-representation in the art can drive morphogen-
esis to a chaotic result. In Jackson Pollock’s art (late period), the fractal character of 
his painting is the primary goal, the actual content. All narrative elements (referring 
to texts as in Leonardo or indoor situations as in Velasquez) and all ﬁgurations based 
on spatial and temporal experiences are eliminated. What is left is the conﬁguration 
of points, lines, surfaces, and colors.

4.5.1 
Chaotic Semiogenesis in the Art of Jackson Pollock 
“No chaos, damn it” replied Jackson Pollock (1912–1956) when critics described 
his art as chaotic and unstructured. However, even before 1947, when Pollock began 
dripping liquid paint from buckets onto the colossal canvas lying on the ﬂoor, some 
well-known artists sprayed paint on surfaces or even shot with paint guns at them. 
Strict, even linear patterns had initially dominated non-representational art; an explo-
sive variety of forms from Dada to Surrealism replaced them. But what does “chaos” 
mean in art? Is it an accusation that artists have to defend themselves against, or can 
chaos in art be the new kind of order? 
Originally, chaos meant a situation preceding creation, the chaos before the ﬁrst 
day of creation. Similarly, the end of the world or the deluge becomes the epitome 
of chaos, and many classical painters have illustrated this situation. For example, 
Leonardo da Vinci depicts rushing ﬂoods (cf. Wildgen [41]: Sect. 3.2); in other 
depictions, people panic in all directions. But chaos is also, and in recent decades 
primarily, a mathematical concept. The core meaning of chaos has three facets: 
1. The simple order of point, line, surface, and body (dimensions 0, 1, 2, 3) can 
be broken up if fractional dimensions (fractals) form the starting point. A line 
is interrupted inﬁnitely often (Cantor line), a surface is “cramned full” with 
lines and curves, and a body is perforated inﬁnitely often (Menger sponge). The 
dimension of these formations can be calculated between 0–1, 1–2, or 2–3. 
2. Instead of being straight or smooth, a curve or curved surface can be so “crum-
pled” that it does not become smooth even at inﬁnite magniﬁcation. In this way, 
Mandelbrot simulated mountain contours and coastlines or the shape of clouds 
using fractal models. 
3. Events can also be chaotic if the number of alternative states increases drastically; 
the Feigenbaum diagrams are characteristic of this. After the Big Bang, the 
universe branched out almost inﬁnitely. Structures with few branches, like trees 
in nature, or the structure of sentences (constituent structures) are special cases. 
The fractal dimension of Pollock’s paintings can be calculated using the box-
counting method. In this procedure, line or empty space occurrences are counted in 
ever smaller sections of the picture. It was found that between 1943 and 1952, i.e., 
the period in which Pollock’s dripping technique developed, the fractal dimension 
increased from 1 (1943) to 1.72 (1952). Analysis of the ﬁlms showing Pollock’s 
painting indicates two characteristic sizes. First, in the range from 1 mm to 5 cm, the 
fractal pattern is caused by hand movements while dripping. Second, in the range 
between 5 cm to 2.5 m, they follow the arm and body movements around and into 
the canvas. Mathematically, multiple pendulums (e.g., combined limb movements or 
limb and brush movements) have chaotic phases, which explains the fractal patterns. 
However, this characteristic only becomes clear because Pollock blocks the usual 
left–right reading of the picture and avoids centering or hierarchies. As a result, the 
visual intensity is refocused; the experience is relieved of recognizable ritual patterns 
and opened to new impressions.

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
Pollock’s ﬁrst large-scale picture focused on lines, was a commissioned work for 
Peggy Guggenheim from 1943: Mural (247 × 605 cm). The dripping technique, 
the reduction of color, and the all-over pattern distribution are characteristics of 
the picture “Number 32” from Pollock’s main creative phase (1950 (North Rhine-
Westphalia Art Collection, Düsseldorf, Pollock-Krasner-Foundation; visit https:// 
www.kunstsammlung.de/de/collection/artists/jackson-pollock). The following prop-
erties stand out:
• Monochrome black paint, no title. Before the dripping phase, Pollock had taken 
great care in choosing a title.
• There are no contoured areas in the picture, only the painting ground, hairlines, 
drips, thickened spots, and emphasized curve segments.
• There are no references to objects (human, animate, artifacts) or forms that can 
be interpreted as such, and no conventional symbolic meanings. 
But what “meaning” do these graphic structures have? First, the missing properties 
make it clear that no external world (with top/bottom, depth effect) and no surfaces 
with light and shadow are represented; the picture shows no reference to what has 
been seen or recognized. Secondly, it refers to the process of production, the artists’ 
movement patterns, and thus to the person in the act of painting. The image “tells” 
itself; it is self-referential, a central feature of chaotic patterns. Thirdly, it concentrates 
on the texture, the graphic, and the calligraphic surface structure. 
The pictures are subject to an organization in which the artist’s aesthetic decisions 
determine the direction but cannot be strictly separated from the self-organization 
in the painting process. This feature points to the “écriture automatique” introduced 
by André Breton. In art, the phases of chaos can have a liberating character and 
make undreamt-of possibilities available. After that, however, the products of these 
phases must be integrated visually and cognitively/emotionally in a ﬁeld accessible 
to a larger public of art lovers, artists, and art collectors. 
4.5.2 
Social Plastic, Diagrams, and Morphogenetic Fields 
in Beuys’ Artwork 
Joseph Beuys had only begun his career in the late ﬁfties of the twentieth century 
when Germany reappeared as a global player in the international political and cultural 
scene. Contrary to Jackson Pollock, Beuys was himself a theoretician of art engaged 
in cultural politics and a protagonist of the rapidly changing avant-garde art scene in 
Europe and America in the sixties and seventies (cf. for a detailed analysis of the art 
of Beuys [42]). 
In the sixties of the twentieth century (ﬁrst in 1967) and the seventies, Beuys 
began to enlarge and redeﬁne his concept of sculpture and art and created the idea 
of “social sculpture” (‘Soziale Plastik’). The materials are not only of organic and

4.5 Fractal Art in Pollock and Art …
77
animal origin but also social and political (society, humanity). Thus, Beuys expanded 
the type of materials for “sculpture”:
• From stone and steel to “warm” materials (wax, honey, grease, animals)
• From animals and humans to social and political entities and even to humanity. 
Consequently, he sketched the program of a new political movement that, together 
with other currents, contributed to the foundation of the “Green party” in Germany. 
Beuys even stood on the list for the ﬁrst elections in which they participated. He also 
initiated a program for alternative universities. Thus, the “Free International Univer-
sity of Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research” was realized in Ireland (Dublin, 
Belfast, and Derry). 
The innovative power of art meant a new perspective beyond politically and intel-
lectually proposed alternatives. Symbolic messages should avoid the deceptive strate-
gies of art depending on political trends (neither afﬁrmative nor in opposition to 
them); they should instead be non-directive, bodily rooted, and in continuity with 
nature. In a broad sense, the art of Beuys is morphogenetic; it reduces the elite gesture 
of artists, which is academy-afﬁrmative and a-social, a-political. 
For Beuys, speaking corresponds to a kind of shaping of ideas and thus is akin 
to sculpture. Language as art is, for Beuys, primarily the play with language sounds 
and underlying concepts. Its goal is the creation of new social meaning. In this line 
of thought, art is a conceptual procedure (an operation with concrete forms, visual 
or spoken) and gives access to unknown pictorial and abstract spaces. 
Beuys combined ﬁgurative drawings with graphical symbols (lines, circles, 
arrows) and written words in diagrams performed on blackboards or the ﬂoor. In 
a diagram of this period (1972), one ﬁnds several scales of concepts:
• Chaos–order; birth–death; cold–warmth; volition–feeling–thinking (Chaos– 
Ordnung; Geburt–Tod; Wärme–Kälte; Willen–Gefühl–Denken); Beuys indirectly 
points to the Aristotelian technique of contraries.
• Order and form are depicted by crystals (regular solids). This reduction to 
primary, ideal forms is a traditional topic since Plato’s dialogue “Timaeus”. In 
the Platonic tradition, Leonardo, Dürer, Kepler, Goethe, and many others referred 
to regular solids and crystals to explain regularity in nature. The opposite— 
chaos, turbulence—is represented by spirals and chaotic attractors. Different 
drawings/diagrams allude to mathematical forms in nature and art and concepts 
in the natural sciences. 
On a more general level, the lesson taught by modern art says that the human 
experience of art is, on the one side, very open and can be adapted to new experiences. 
On the other side, it is guided by social processes, be they local such as by groups or 
centers of art, or global such as the cultural changes after the wars (1919 and 1946). In 
the work of Beuys, the dimension of reﬂective processes, art theories, and art politics 
(even of a utopia where artists shape society or humanity) became a prominent factor. 
Meanwhile, this trend may have lost its fascination, but it can be expected to show up 
again under speciﬁc conditions. Permanent change seems to be the distinctive mark 
of art in the modern world.

Morphogenesis in Human Settlement and Architecture 
The prototype of a shelter in human prehistory was a cave not far from the shore, a 
lake, a river, and possibly on the slope of a hill for a good overview of the surrounding 
area. This site will be found along the migration routes of Homo heidelbergensis and 
Homo sapiens (following shores and rivers) and in the caves which document the 
social life of Homo sapiens. The prototype for the (primarily seasonal) dwellings 
had the following zones:
• Cave entrance (often under some rocky roof) with an external zone for social life, 
tools manufacturing, and distribution of prey and harvest products.
• Cave mouth (still with light from the entrance or ﬁre) for family life and sleep.
• Deep cave interior for spiritual events like rituals. 
The primary opposition: abris or shelter versus area of chase/harvest, including 
shores, lakesides, or river banks, deﬁned the proximate ecology. The shoreline could 
be extended via migration, i.e., the next generation could move to a similar ecology 
along the water’s edge. This migration line deﬁned the ﬁrst transport technology: the 
raft, which expanded the natural capacity of wading, swimming, and diving. The boat 
became the archetype of instrumental locomotion. Until the Neolithic revolution, all 
settlements were seasonal because humans had, like other carnivores, to seasonally 
follow their prey or, if they were scavengers, the predators. This pattern continued 
until recent times in many parts of the world. 
Instead, more permanent settlements appeared when agriculture became domi-
nant.11 With the permanent settlement, building a house became a speciﬁc goal and 
led to the advent of architecture. Some aspects of morphogenesis in architecture are 
the topic of the next section. Architecture’s long and diverse history is neglected, 
focusing on speciﬁc phenomena where the morphogenetic aspect is manifested. 
4.6.1 
Morphogenesis of Urban Structures 
The ﬁrst towns emerged, e.g., Jericho at 8,000 BC, Çatalhöyük (7,500 BC), Eridu, Ur, 
and Byblos (between 5000 and 4,000 BC). These ‘towns’ already contained a large 
population and had a wall that limited the town area and later provided defense. 
Particular derivations of the abri (cave) and the town are burial sites, graves, and 
graveyards (grave villages and towns). 
The morphogenesis of the town is governed by two forces that deﬁne its shape: 
(1) The individual houses and their use by the owners/builders. 
(2) Collective protection (against enemies) and communal functions (market, 
political decision, religious practice).
11 In the case of an agriculture based on burning brushland, the settlement moved slowly in the 
controlled area. 

4.6 Morphogenesis in Human Settlement and Architecture
79
Fortiﬁcation was necessary for the accumulation of goods and wealth in Neolithic 
societies. However, this development also led to social segregation inside the town 
and corresponding differences in house building and defense style. 
The next stage is reached when the local type of self-organization, which is only 
globally controlled by the protective wall, is replaced by a central plan. This can 
be shown in the case of rectangular grids in towns. The ﬁrst grid pattern in towns 
probably emerged in the Indus Valley, and Herodotus reports that Babylon had ample 
straight avenues intersecting at right angles. 
4.6.2 
Self-Organization of Urban Structures Versus 
Ratiogenetic Planning and Imitation 
The Romans, who exported a standardized town plan to many regions of their empire, 
developed the pattern they had found in the Greek colonies in Italy (cf. Naples). The 
Roman Paris also showed such a grid. In the Middle Ages, this traditional pattern 
was lost in Paris but recovered in the thirteenth century in France (‘ville-neuves’ and 
‘bastides’) and England (Welsh ‘bastides’). After its destruction by an earthquake in 
1755, Lisbon was reconstructed on a rectangular grid pattern. 
If the early or medieval towns show a compromise between more or less free 
individual settlements and a defensive fortiﬁcation (ideally in a circle), the new 
towns planned by a centralized agency demonstrated the will of one person or an 
administration. On the other hand, the idealized geometrical forms had to respect 
a speciﬁc population’s geographical, climatic, and economic conditions. Therefore, 
the outcome is mostly a compromise ﬁrst between the individual goals and values 
and collective ones (often represented by some institution or leader); second between 
speciﬁc natural conditions that change in time and traditional forms that have gained 
some credit (fame). 
Upon this rather basic substratum, several symbolic levels could be grafted. They 
communicate differences in power and wealth or religious/ideological values. The 
question of how such compromises are reached is difﬁcult because many alter-
natives may exist, and chance factors may inﬂuence the outcome. This situation 
can be modeled dynamically in synergetics, which analyzes the combined effect of 
many subsystems and focuses on simple rules which can reduce their complexity. 
Another choice is chaos theory and fractal geometry, where irregular patterns can be 
understood more easily. 
The main differences between architectural and urban semiotics relate ﬁrst to 
space and time. Spatially, the city not only includes residents and guests, but it 
also includes houses, streets/squares, boundaries (fortiﬁcations), and possibly a river 
or an estuary. Just as the house is embedded in a landscape structured by paths, 
ﬁelds/gardens, forest/lake/moor, the city is also embedded in a network of trails, often 
in a web of trunk roads. The house contains a family (or more) and their property. The 
city includes a population. The house has a prominent space as its center (e.g., the

80
4
The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
living room), and the city has a building or a central square surrounded by buildings 
as its center. In terms of time, a house can be designed and built by the owner and his 
architect. However, the morphogenesis of a city can last for centuries, even thousands 
of years. Existing spaces are constantly being rebuilt, often while preserving their 
essential functions and meanings. In this temporal perspective, the city is relatively 
independent of individual planning. In cases of destruction through conﬂagration, 
war, or brutal urban innovation breaks, this quasi-biotic morphogenetic city becomes 
a giant piece of architecture or even a monumental sculpture (see the capital of Bresil, 
Brasilia, planned in 1956 and founded in 1960). 
Beyond architectural and urban morphogenesis lies the morphogenesis of land-
scape. The landscape, e.g., of a country estate in Veneto (see the analysis of the Villa 
Barbaro in Maser by Palladio in Wildgen [41]: Sect. 8.3), is reﬂected functionally 
and symbolically in the architecture of the country house (estate). Seen globally, 
many courtyards, outbuildings, ﬁelds, paths, forests, and waters result in an encom-
passing whole, e.g., the villa formed by an architect like Palladio. The landscape’s 
geological formation, particularly evident in the case of seashores and mountains, 
belongs to another type of morphogenesis largely independent of humans.12 For 
the artists of the nineteenth century, this landscape was, therefore, fascinating in its 
natural symbolism. The romantic painter was able to illustrate elementary forces and 
contents in the painting of a landscape. However, to the extent that tourists took hold 
of exciting landscapes, e.g., the high mountains, the natural state of these landscapes 
was increasingly destroyed and changed by countless (often architectural) interven-
tions. Ratiogenetic forms conﬂict with natural morphogenetic symbolic forms, either 
those emerging independently in our ecology or those formed by the natural dynamics 
of human life. 
4.6.3 
Political Ethics and the Architecture of the Town Hall 
in the Late Renaissance 
Inhabitants or tourists may value a room, a house, or a street/quarter. Their subjective 
choice can inﬂuence the price of apartments or hotels. Therefore, urban dynamics 
can be understood as a search for a value maximum. This search is limited by the 
costs and has to respect the hierarchy of values accepted at the construction time. 
Thus the kings or the archbishops can have the privilege of the largest, highest, 
best-decorated palace or church. On the other hand, an entrepreneur may be able to
12 However, the natural structure of a landscape can be also artistically formed, for instance, by the 
landscape art of Christo (1935–2020), see for example the Veiled Coast (1969, Australia) and the 
Valley Curtain (1970, Colorado), Land art reacts to the post-industrial (transformed) landscape; see 
Paquet [27].

buy all the houses in a particular street and rebuild it, thus imposing his architec-
tural imagination.13 Dramatic value changes occurred during the Reform (sixteenth 
century) in Northern Europe, when monasteries were abolished, i.e., either destroyed 
or transformed for other institutions. Beyond this destruction, new architectural forms 
visualize the values of the reformed religion. Many are ambivalent, can support 
different values, be re- and misinterpreted, and may coexist for extended periods. 
Thus in Bremen, the massive Romanic/Gothic cathedral exhibits the self-evaluation 
of medieval archbishops. In contrast, the smaller but still representative town hall 
stands for the values of the commercial town with its elected town council. The 
value system of the commercial city, as a member of the Hanse (north European 
commercial league), is expressed by the oversized statue of Roland (with sword and 
gold-braided coat, built in the year 1404). It represents the town’s independence from 
the feudal regiment (the archbishop who rules the whole territory surrounding the 
free Hanseatic town). The Gothic decoration of the town hall was refurnished around 
1610 in the style of the Northern Renaissance. The ﬁgure of a woman riding a ﬁsh in 
the arcades of the town hall with a key in her hand is often interpreted as an allegory 
of Bremen, i.e., “Brema”, because the key in her hand is the emblem of the town. 
However, this sculpture reinterprets contemporary prints and can be reconstructed as 
an allegory of “temperantia”, i.e., temperance, moderation, a virtue political leaders 
should demonstrate. A similar misinterpretation occurred in the case of the allegory 
of “vigilantia” (vigilance), which became the center of a myth of origin invented 
in the nineteenth century. The ﬁrst citizen may have chosen this place when they 
observed that a hen protected her chicken on this dune in security against inunda-
tion (cf. for more details Wildgen [41]: 274–284). These examples show the easy 
transformation of an “interpretant” given architectural sign forms with a forgotten 
historical context (Fig. 4.8). The invention of a myth of origin may even occur ad 
hoc in modern times (see Chap. 5 for the dynamics of myths). 
13 Thus the coffee-entrepreneur Roselius bought the old houses in central Böttcherstraße in Bremen 
and built a neo-classic street, one of the major tourist attractions of present Bremen. 

82

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
Thus, if in 1400 the ﬁgure of a warrior, a henchman of Charles the Great, repre-
sented the values of an ambitious commercial town, independent from local feudal 
sovereigns and with “free” citizens, the copious illustrations on the late-Renaissance 
facade demonstrate the erudition of its council members and their principles of 
governance. 
Beyond basic value systems linked to dominant parties in the township, architec-
tural styles shape urban architecture. For example, after the destructions of World 
War II in Germany, a conﬂict between historical reconstructions aiming at continuity 
with traditional values on the one hand and new value systems linked to moderniza-
tion on the other triggered intense public debate. Other conﬂicts involve local value 
systems (neighborhoods) against global plans for trafﬁc ﬂow. These examples show 
that the landscape of value-ascriptions is multifaceted, if not fractal, i.e., many small 
and large value systems coexist, and a complicated bargaining process takes place. 
As a result, urban developments may be ampliﬁed or stopped by these processes. 
The speciﬁc features of value dynamics are of two kinds: Firstly, they exhibit 
a strong memory effect, e.g., those values valid for earlier times and generations 
are conserved with preference and value changes are suppressed, i.e., the dynamics 
are conservative. Under exceptional circumstances (large natural catastrophes and 
political revolutions), a rapid value change can overwhelm such barriers and trigger 
sudden changes. Secondly, there is an “echo effect”. If a value-based structure is 
destroyed, the void tends to be ﬁlled by forms with similar values (of similar type). 
An example of the ﬁrst tendency is the reconstruction of historical city centers in 
Western Germany after the bombing of World War II, which destroyed 70 to 80% 
of the buildings. As a compromise between memory and modernization, an eclectic 
style emerged. An example of the “echo effect” is the instauration of buildings with 
a cultural function in places where earlier religious architectures were destroyed (for 
instance, in the time of Reform). The museum or theater is a morphogenetic “echo” 
of religious buildings with spiritual, intellectual, and artistic values in earlier times. 
4.6.4 
Biomorphic Principles in the Architecture of Antoni 
Gaudi 
The still unﬁnished project for the Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona is an excel-
lent example of how morphogenetic aspects surface in urban architecture. Antoni 
Gaudi (1852–1926) proceeded from the principle that what is beautiful and authentic 
in architecture is not invented by man but is found by man through observation and 
imitation of nature. The organic world and the principles on which the organic is based 
play an essential role in his architecture. In technical realization, Gaudi relies on prin-
ciples of geometry and statics. However, the focus is not on the geometry of the land 
surveyor but on the geometry of living nature. Gaudi, therefore, experimented with 
convex and concave surfaces, with conoids, hyperbolic and parabolic surfaces, and

4.6 Morphogenesis in Human Settlement and Architecture
83
Fig. 4.9 The tree-like pillars and botanic/zoological details at the door of the cathedral “Sacrada 
Familia” in Barcelona (Foto by W.W. 2022) 
their intersections. Since the mathematical mastery of these new forms was still insuf-
ﬁcient, Gaudi tested the statics and dynamics of such constructions using his inverted 
rope models hung with weights. Currently, the vaulting of the Sacrada Familia has 
been completed using modern computer-aided design techniques (Fig. 4.9). 
The towers of Gaudi’s cathedral look like termite mounds. The nave, which was 
only completed before the sanctiﬁcation by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010, reminds the 
visitor of a massive forest with high trees, the ceiling interrupted by windows, again 
comparable to spots of light penetrating the roof of a forest. 
Other constructions copied from living nature are the roof construction of the 
opera building in Sydney in analogy to the spherical shell geometry (design by Jorn 
Utzon 1957). Unfortunately, the building could only be converted into a technically 
feasible construction after lengthy experiments (end of construction in 1973). This 
trend continues in today’s virulent "soft" design based on computer simulations and 
computer aided design (CAD), which brings the architecture close to a sculptural 
style. Classic examples are the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao (Frank O. Gehry, 
1997), his Experience Music Project, Seattle, 2000, or within the Millennium Dome 
(London) the Body Zone, a structure in the shape of a reclining woman (Branson 
Coates, 2000); see Jodidio ([14]: 60f. and 32f.). 
The consistent penetration of the construction with a biomorphic concept still 
distinguishes Gaudi’s buildings since he designed the outer facade, the interior, and 
the furniture according to the same principles. Materials and building techniques 
are essential in searching for new forms. Examples are The iron constructions of 
the late nineteenth century (prototype: Eiffel Tower), the concrete constructions (Le 
Corbusier, Ronchamps Church), and stretched tent constructions (Olympic Stadium 
Munich and tent-like construction in Astana; Kazakhstan). Spider webs and tents 
as primitive (prehistoric) building constructions are implicit references to biological 
and behavioral morphogenesis. In all these cases, human construction implements

84

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
constructions found in nature with different and technically improved means. The 
biological sense of natural construction has its roots in the instinctive behavior of an 
animal and, ultimately, in the evolutionary selection conditions of the species. Thus, 
at least in part, the meaning of architecture to humans is grounded in fundamental 
meanings in nature, i.e., it can be derived from biosemiotics (cf. Nöth [25]: 254). 
The buildings mentioned above usually form nodal points in social life. For 
example, many people gather in the church, the opera, and the stadium. Here they 
perceive themselves as a community and take part in ritual acts. The simple dwelling 
houses, on the other hand, do not have this collective meaning; in return, they 
determine the private living environment and the intimacy of the residents and are, 
therefore, signiﬁcant for families and individuals. 
4.6.5 
The Morphogenesis of Typical Harbor Towns 
In the following section, urban structures focusing on harbor towns will be consid-
ered, i.e., towns on a river or estuary with access to the sea. For example, Paris on 
the Seine (more than 100 km from the sea) and Bremen (60 km from the sea) are 
cities on the river and traditional port cities. For the morphogenesis of harbor towns, 
cf. Wildgen [41]: Sect. 9.1 (in German) and [40] (presentation in English). 
The primary feature of a harbor town is the opposition: land (shelter) versus water 
(motion). It implies using boats and ships, i.e., boats arrive and depart, ships are built 
(repaired), and goods are transported and commercially exploited (stocked, sold). A 
marketplace emerges, and eventually, factories and habitations for manufacturers are 
built. The stockpiling of goods required protection (against thieves or pirates). The 
emerging social stratiﬁcation induced spatial differentiation (differences in housing) 
or even segregation (in city quarters). The value system gave rise to economic stan-
dards valid in a town/region and to exchange patterns between towns/regions (see 
the origin of banking). The rights and privileges of different groups or even of towns 
in a commercial network needed laws, courts, and administrations. The semiosis of 
the commercial system led to very complex rule systems, which eventually collapsed 
when the global conditions (of power or the available commercial routes or resources) 
changed. What remained stable over the centuries were the primary signiﬁcance of 
land/sea and the global ways of exchange depending on the geographical and physical 
conditions of a region/country. In the following, we consider the aspect of architec-
ture and urban structure as the outcome of semiosis in the (former) harbor towns: 
Lisbon, Paris, Bremen, and Aarhus. 
Morphogenesis presupposes that there is a ‘germ’ of the town and that basic 
dynamic laws control its unfolding. In the case of harbor towns, we consider the 
phase transition of land to water and a singularity of paths. Prominent singularities 
are crossing two roads (or a road and a river) or the existence of an island. In the 
following examples, we have a shore or the bank of a river (with access to the sea) 
and a simple or double singularity of paths:

4.6 Morphogenesis in Human Settlement and Architecture

1. Lisbon: Two creeks ﬂow to the shore between higher banks shaping a plain 
(actually the Rossio). The river opens to the sea. 
2. Paris: An island in the river Seine leading to the sea and several hills around a 
ﬂat and wet area. A road crosses the river via the island (Île de la Cité). 
3. Bremen: A dune along the river, a tributary river forming an island, and two 
long-distance paths/roads, one crossing the river near the island. 
4. Aarhus: A shoreline and a river mound. Neighboring heights delineate a ﬂat area. 
The geographical or geological situations may have had different types of affor-
dance, i.e., the physical context allows or “invites” speciﬁc usages and functions in 
the perspective of the human actor (cf. for this term Gibson [10]). The affordance 
differs for alternating populations on the site and can change dramatically over the 
centuries. What counts in the case of harbor towns is the catastrophic transition: land 
to water, road connection (transport of goods and persons), and the shelter type (dune 
against ﬂoods, island against invasion, steep hills for defense). In the case of a harbor 
town, the transition line between water and land is an affordance for ship-berthing 
and shipbuilding. Later, the opposite bank and other places toward the sea can be 
used as harbor expansions. Finally, secondary functions like storage, manufacture, 
and market unfold in the neighborhood of the harbor zone. The evolution or unfolding 
of affordance over the centuries was different in the four towns compared: 
(a) 
In Lisbon, many different cultures used the location (cf. Marcos [19, 20]), but the 
wet plain between the high grounds and the bank became, after its drainage, the 
center of the harbor (shipbuilding) and commerce. Steep fortiﬁed hills afforded 
its protection. In addition, religious functions were established on the heights. 
(b) In Paris, the pre-Roman inhabitants of Lutetia probably used the island in the 
river as shelter and protection. The Romans built their town on the heights of the 
Southern shore (today Quartier Latin). The central road (‘cardo’) of the roman 
city corresponds to the boulevard St. Michel and the streets of the ‘quartier Latin 
still visualize the roman grid (cf. http://paris-atlas-historique.fr/38.html). The 
river Bièvre and the zone around the bridge to the island in the south were the 
original harbor sites (cf. Velay [31]: 1–2). 
(c) 
Bremen developed following its Christianization (it became the seat of a bishop 
in 787). The church on top of the dune may have been the decisive symbolic 
germ. With the medieval trafﬁc on the North Sea and the Baltic, its small harbor 
evolved into an important commercial place in Northern Europe. 
(d) In Aarhus, a Viking town was built on a triangular surface closed on two sides 
by shore and river. The third ﬂat side could be artiﬁcially closed by a moat. 
Later Christian missionaries built a church outside this area which subsequently 
moved into the center. 
The morphogenesis of a town is a kind of semiogenesis insofar as the physical 
factors: land/water–hill/plain, become inﬂuential forces only as they gain signiﬁcance 
for the human settlers. Nevertheless, the governing forces remain so basic and stable 
that we can observe regular patterns analogous to morphogenetic patterns in physics, 
chemistry, and embryology.

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
Due to different ecologies and populations, European harbor towns differ in 
many respects. Therefore, the four cities compared can be classiﬁed into two groups 
according to their networks and areas: 
– The north European network is linked to Viking trade routes (around 1,000 AD) 
and the Hanseatic trader league (1200–1500 AD). Aarhus and Bremen are 
examples of this evolution. 
– Paris and Lisbon are mainly inﬂuenced by the urban patterns of the Roman Empire 
(its colonies), the medieval Arabic and Christian reorganization, and moderniza-
tions since the seventeenth century. Both towns were either the model imitated 
by modern European capitals (Paris) or were exported to overseas foundations 
(Lisbon). 
The historical change of the four towns also inﬂuenced their architecture: 
1. In Lisbon, the Visigoths fortiﬁed the steepest hill, which was further fortiﬁed after 
the Arabic conquest (719), to become the “Alcáçova”, and after the reconquest 
(1147), the fort S. José. The Arabic mosque at the center of the Arabic Almedina 
became the (rebuilt) Christian cathedral Sé. Large monasteries and churches were 
placed on top of the neighboring hills, thus occupying the signiﬁcant (“prégnant”) 
hills punctuating the urban pattern. The commercial city moved to the ﬂat part 
(former river bed) and the banks of the river Tejo (Praça de Commercio). From the 
shipyards on the Tejo, the expeditions to Africa (1419) and India (1488) opened 
the era of colonial expansion. An earthquake and tsunami in 1755 destroyed the 
city (mainly the Baixa), which the Marquès de Pombal rebuilt with a rectangular 
pattern. 
2. In the case of Paris, the Romans founded a new city on the higher grounds in 
the South and built a road going from South to North, which deﬁned an axis 
on the island: West (administrative)–East (religious), which persisted. In the 
seventeenth century, the city walls were replaced by broad roads (boulevards), 
and in the nineteenth century, Haussmann (1809–1891) destroyed many medieval 
quarters and modernized their structures. 
3. After its Christianization in medieval times, Aarhus developed similar patterns in 
its center as Bremen. The original town hall was constructed with its back to the 
cathedral’s facade and a central marketplace opened in front of it. The town hall 
was later destroyed and moved twice to the periphery of the historic center. In this 
respect, Bremen preserved its tradition (probably due to its political autonomy; 
Aarhus fell under the rule of the Danish kings who resided in Copenhagen). In 
contrast to Bremen, the harbor in Aarhus is still near the city center. 
Urban morphogenesis generally unfolds in a permanent process in which the 
geographical and geological conditions are relatively stable. However, the character-
istics of a harbor town may be lost if the sea-level changes or new demands invalidate 
former affordances. Thus Paris is no more a harbor for ocean ships, Bremen had to 
transform its river into a deep channel in the late nineteenth century to remain a 
harbor city, but container ships prefer to land in Bremerhaven. Aarhus still has a 
harbor near the city center, but the Baltic Sea has no tide, and ocean ships prefer

Copenhagen or ports on the ocean side of Denmark. Finally, as in most classical 
harbor towns, the harbor has moved away from the city center in Lisbon. 
4.7 
Final Remarks: Visual Morphogenesis, Its Central 
Principles, and the Proper Concept of Space 
As sources of stability and evolution/development in visual art, four signiﬁcant 
factors come into consideration: 
1. Principles of visual perception, memory, and cognitive processing in humans. 
2. Objective properties and design options. They are mainly based on the physics 
and chemistry of the materials. This factor is particularly evident in the means 
of painting, the structure of stone and wood in sculpture, the techniques used 
to print graphics, and the casting of bronze sculptures. In architecture, these are 
technical innovations such as steel construction or concrete structures. 
3. The social ﬁeld of art. It concerns values in the political area and the condition 
of the market. Since the art market is now global and the artist has to see himself 
as a worldwide player, economic/political frames and restrictions are effective. 
They can generate general trends and standards of value. 
4. A fourth determinant is neither cognitive/material nor social/political. Neverthe-
less, it played an essential role in our analyses. It is the complex of space and 
time (or space–time) and its role in perception and semiosis. As space and time 
are central topics of philosophy and humanities, it is worth taking a closer look 
at this determinant. 
Newton’s “absolute space”, which Kant still used as a foil for his a priori of 
perception (Anschauung), is challenged. Due to Einstein’s theory of relativity and 
quantum physics, Newton’s space is only valid to a limited extent.14 The physical 
limitations apply to the vast (outer space) and the very small (the subatomic realm). 
However, facts of vision and human perception or semiosis occur in the spatial scale’s 
middle range. Euclidean space is central to human perception and locomotion but 
not universal. Helmholtz already showed in a lecture of 1870 based on Riemann’s 
mathematical results that non-Euclidean (constantly curved) spaces are also relevant 
in human vision. Nevertheless, he made it clear in his rectorate speech of 1878 
that Euclidean geometry represents a sufﬁciently good approximation for the visual 
experiences of humans.15 The criticism by relativists, rejecting “objective” models of
14 Einstein invested the physical space with geometry and dynamics that explain gravitation. In 
the same mode, visual space (and, by analogy, the space of the other symbolic forms) can be 
invested with speciﬁc features that explain the basic laws of visual perception and communication. 
Unfortunately, this suggestion cannot be followed in the present context. For the epistemology of 
symbolic forms and adequate ontologies, see Chap. 7. 
15 Cf. [11] and  [12] Brozzoli and Famè ([3]: 153) summarize the results of neuro visual experiments: 
“Thus, three main regions of space in respect to the body can be differentiated: a personal space, 
that is the body itself, principally based on the somatosensory input (proprioceptive and tactile

The Morphogenesis of Visual Symbolic Forms …
visual semiosis and language, points to restrictions that can be considered. Still, they 
do not proscribe a scientiﬁc analysis of visual morphogenesis or language. Instead, 
one must use a more ﬂexible conception of space and time. 
Concerning the mathematical notions of space, the advances in topology devel-
oped towards the end of the nineteenth century are an excellent approach to visual 
space. General topology can be given various properties, e.g., those of a metric space, 
but one can also work with topologically weaker (qualitative) spaces. Regarding 
movement in space, one can apply differential topology, catastrophe and bifurcation 
theory, and, more generally, differential calculus. Therefore, a range of available 
mathematical constructs with the help of which a scientiﬁc discourse on questions 
of space and time (of becoming, happening) can be organized beyond the contexts 
of natural sciences. Cassirer explained in a lecture in 1931 that the physical and 
mathematical space belongs to the symbolic form of causal-rational knowledge. A 
somewhat different concept of space can be assumed for the other symbolic forms, 
although it is not unrelated to the former. A suitable starting point is provided by 
Leibniz’s suggestions in his Analysis situs (cf. Heuser [13]: 186–189). Contrary 
to Descartes, Leibniz does not presuppose a general, external coordinate system but 
rather local relations and movements (transformations) that deﬁne geometric objects. 
As he already indicated in his “Mathesis Universalis”, this concept leads to a qual-
itative analysis of space that can also be used beyond a causal-rational construction 
of space, cf. the arguments in Cassirer [6]. 
The orders that arise are speciﬁc to the particular symbolic forms, and Cassirer 
speaks of an “aesthetic space” and a “mythical space”.16 The aesthetic space is 
determined by the different senses and the materials in which artistic forms are 
realized. This speciﬁc nature distinguishes the types of art (painting, poetry, music). 
Cassirer calls this aspect with Husserl “hyletic” (sensual). This space can be expanded 
or elaborated and enriched in many ways. Painting, sculpture, theater/opera/ﬁlm can 
be combined differently within the visual domain. Music, art, and language can be 
integrated to form new complexes so that a “total work of art” (“Gesamtkunstwerk” 
in terms of Richard Wagner) is created. 
The space of visual communication has a basis in the primary space of human 
experience and action, but it is expandable, compressible, and transferable. Social 
space plays a vital role in architecture and urban planning. This unfolding also applies 
to aesthetic space as it is subject to social evaluation and is formed in social contexts 
of use. Since visual perception is essentially dynamic and relates to events and 
actions, a static concept of space is insufﬁcient. Essential are scenarios of evolution
modality, but also important is the vision, which contributes to the deﬁnition of this region of space), 
a peripersonal space region, that is the area around the body, where tactile and visual information are 
massively integrated; ﬁnally the extra personal region of space, whose representation is principally 
based on the “tele-sensory” modalities (vision and audition).
16 The deities and demons are arranged in mythical systems and, ﬁnally, in religions. In some 
polytheistic religions, this leads to families or even societies of gods, and in monotheistic religions, 
mythical space is centered on one God (sometimes with angels and saints). Cf. for further discussions

and development (morphogenesis), changes (transformations), sudden transitions 
(catastrophes), and their categorical perception. 
In the context of the evolutionary dimension of visual morphogenesis, reference 
was made to the dramatic changes in human habitation and the consequences that 
these changes had for symbolic behavior and visual art. One trend is consistent: 
people are increasingly shaping their environment, ﬁrst in their immediate area of 
life (caves, temporary dwellings), then in houses, villages, towns, etc. Nevertheless, 
the objectively comprehensible space is the ideal point of reference, knowing very 
well that there is a whole universe of social and individual subsidiary effects that 
may be decisive in speciﬁc situations. In the long-term view, they must be secured 
in a mathematical language for consistency, e.g., geometry, topology, differential 
calculus, or a new area of mathematics that must be devised for this purpose. 
As these brief comments have shown, a concept of space and becoming/change is 
necessary for all analyses in the humanities, speciﬁcally in the sciences of signs (semi-
otics), media, and symbolic forms. However, the universality of visual morphogenesis 
and semiosis depends on two conditions: 
1. The analysis must start from a general and consistent construct of space and 
movement in space. In concrete terms, it must have a geometric-topological 
and dynamic foundation. In addition, morphogenesis and self-organization are 
required to cope with the complexity of symbolic systems. 
2. Questions of evolution and historical development must be formulated, and 
answers found. This task overcomes the ahistorical view of structuralism, but 
it must avoid the historicism of linguistics and other disciplines in the nineteenth 
century.

The Morphogenesis 
and Self-Organization of Myth 
and Religion 
Abstract In the ﬁrst step, the domain of religion (including myth and pre- or post-
religious symbolic forms) is delimitated. In the second step, the emergence of myth 
and religion and the morphogenesis of concrete religious structures in some world 
religions are described. In the third step, major religions’ spatial and temporal char-
acteristics are analyzed (concepts of past, future, apocalypse, and spatial itineraries). 
Some features of religious morphogenesis are modeled in the format of catastrophe 
theory. The self-organization of elaborated religions (based on texts) is exempliﬁed 
in the early history of Christianism. The semantics of religious concepts (God, angel, 
heaven, etc.) are deviant from everyday discourse as their reference (called tanscen-
dent) is endangered by vagueness and ambiguity. This feature leads to the question 
of truth in religion, religious pluralism, and the phenomenon of “bricolage” (Lévi-
Straus) or systemic construction in myth and religion. The ﬁnal section deals with 
xenophobia and racist distortions of history in the political mythology of the Nazi 
regime. 
5.1 
Introductory Remarks on Myth, Religion, 
and Quasi-religious Phenomena 
Ernst Cassirer treated the symbolic form of myth and religion in the second volume 
of his “Philosophy of symbolic forms” (1923–1929). Mythical thinking is embedded 
in a sequence between natural language (ﬁrst volume) and mathematically organized 
science (pure symbolic forms; the third volume of the trilogy). In 1942, Cassirer 
mentioned another sequence or quasi-order: Language, Myth, and Art (cf. [7]). In 
his last book ([6] published posthumously in 1946), “The Myth of the State”, he 
focused on myth as a politically manipulating technique, masked as science but below 
scientiﬁc standards. He remarked that the German language had been manipulated by 
political propaganda, so he could no longer fully understand it at the end of the Second 
World War. Thus, the symbolic forms Cassirer analyzed after 1920 and until 1945

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
allow for transitions and indicate an underlying continuum. The following focus will 
be on religion with a side view on myth. Religion and theology had been in conﬂict 
or rivalry with philosophy since the beginning until philosophy seemed (after the 
French revolution) to have made religion a non-subject. It became a favorite subject 
of sociology at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth 
century; cf. the contributions of Emil Durkheim, Marcel Mauss, and Max Weber 
(these aspects are treated in Wildgen [44]: 67–77, in German). The ethnography of 
myth was the central concern of Franz Boas and his school in the United States, 
and Levi-Strauss joined this tradition when he was in New York as a refugee. In the 
series of books called “Mythologiques” that Lévi-Strauss published after his return 
to France, a vast corpus of mythological narratives was analyzed in a hermeneutic, 
almost literary style. He was therefore named as a member of the Paris Academy, 
an honor customarily reserved for authors of novels and poems. Speciﬁc aspects of 
his analyses are commented on in the section on space in myth. The focus of this 
chapter is, however, on the morphogenesis of myth and religion, not on a typology 
of myths and religions.1 
The biological morphogenesis of the human predisposition and interest in religion 
is probably linked to the emergence of human cognition (the mental grasp on past and 
future events and actions) and human societies. Like human language, it follows from 
the formation of Homo sapiens in the Paleolithic area between 300,000 and 200,000 
BP (BP = years before present). However, predispositions were fulﬁlled already at 
the stage of Homo erectus, i.e., since 1,8 million years BP (see my commentaries on 
the evolution of symbolic forms in Chaps. 3, 4, and 6). 
The area of religion ﬁrst includes what is given today by the abundance of 
established religious denominations and their practices; in addition, ethnic forms 
of religion and forms of religion documented from the past that deviate from today’s 
pattern of religious beliefs must be taken into account. These are often referred to 
as “myths”, in their description, one speaks of mythology (of the Egyptians, Greeks, 
Germans, etc.). Totem cultures and fetishes also play a role in historical consider-
ations. We will give examples as the investigation progresses. Beyond historically 
proven phenomena of the religious (we subsume the mythical here), one can presume 
prehistoric, archaic predecessor phenomena. The species boundaries, in particular 
the evolution of Homo sapiens, form a time limit (about 300,000 years ago). Politi-
cally motivated myths, ideologies, and philosophical systems of ethics, which offer 
themselves as a replacement or as a modernization of traditional religions, form an 
upper limit (e.g., the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries). The fact that, in these 
cases, there is no longer any mention of a god, creator, or historically documented 
prophet is not an exclusion criterion. In the diversity of world religions and their vari-
ants, there are certain confessions without a personal god, as in Buddhism and Far 
Eastern religions (see Glasenapp [12]: 209ff.). The forms of religiosity are outlined 
by the limits mentioned in Table 5.1.
1 Cf. my comments and the reconstruction of Lévi Strauss’ “formule du mythe”, a quasi-arithmetic 
formula that summarizes his insights into the phenomenon of myth in Wildgen ([44], in German 
and [43], in French).

Many forms of religion are 
historically documented or 
still exist, including the major 
world religions and their 
internal variation. It contains 
religions with a personal God 
and those that assume more 
general religious principles or 
forces. Beliefs without written 
traditions are based on oral 
traditions and ritual initiation 
and are organized differently 
than those with a canon of 
sacred texts2 
Many religions have developed 
hybrid forms of public and 
religious power. Modern

also show quasi-religious traits

belief or principles of

An overarching, comparative concept of religion only emerges when dealing with 
many religions or in a competitive situation. This move is happening very late in 
the history of religions (in modern times and especially in the nineteenth century). 
Since colonialism and its Europe-centric perspective have dominated the discourse in 
both contexts, the term “religion” is sometimes referred to as a “European-Christian 
invention” (see Haußig and Scherer [16]). The self-designation of a religious commu-
nity, such as Hinduism or Judaism, usually occurs late and in contrast to other 
communities. As in Hinduism, one’s religion may be understood as a universal 
phenomenon,the other communities are only partial, incomplete realizations or spec-
iﬁcations (cf. Haußig [15]). The controversies about the idea of religion manifest a 
semiotic discourse within communities and in academia that seeks to force existing 
regulatory deﬁnitions into a coherent grid, whereby the distinctions inherent in reli-
gions are modiﬁed or ignored. We shall not go this route and take as a starting point 
a core area outlined by well-documented or empirically accessible religions, myths, 
rituals, and practices. From this ﬁeld, archaic predecessor forms can be carefully 
guessed, or manifestations of faith can be addressed that, after the loss of importance 
of some church organizations, are a kind of functional continuation of religious 
behavior and beliefs. These forms are referred to as pseudo-religious. 
According to Cassirer, religion is a separate “symbolic form” that shares a semiotic 
basis with language, art, technology, and science. The relationship of religion to its 
(possible) predecessor or successor forms is illustrated in Table 5.1.
2 Émile Durkheim argued that the ritual unfolds social elements present in barter trade. In a 
similar line, Habermas says that the ritual contributes to the conﬁrmation of social dependency 
and obedience to rules of behavior (cf. Habermas [13] and Viertbauer [33]: 125).

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
In addition to theology and religious studies, sociology, psychology, and the 
philosophy of religion have dealt with the phenomenon of religion. The morpho-
genetic analysis of religion opens a new interdisciplinary ﬁeld in which religion is 
analyzed as a natural phenomenon linked to humans’ ecology and cognitive and 
social capacities. 
5.2 
The Morphogenetic Approach in Religious Studies 
One has to distinguish the original genesis of religious forms from the further devel-
opment of such structures in social and political contexts. From a morphogenetic 
point of view, the former is paramount and, under fortunate circumstances, offers the 
possibility of recognizing regularities, i.e., of gaining general knowledge. The latter 
ﬁrst has to be freed from a myriad of historically contingent inﬂuences, e.g., coinci-
dences of politics and their consequences, so that the intrinsic dynamics of religion 
become visible. Eventually, and this is what Max Weber was looking for, the laws 
of the propagation of religious creeds and the coordination of aligned needs can be 
found. Scientiﬁc clariﬁcation of the properly religious moment is possible only if the 
non-religious factors are controlled. The social laws are by no means primarily of a 
religious nature and are therefore only of secondary relevance for our investigation. 
In the context of a “morphogenesis” of the religious, one might ﬁrst think of the 
founders of religion, such as the legendary Moses and the historically veriﬁed ﬁgures 
of Buddha, Jesus, or Mohammed, in this historical sequence, or of ﬁgures such as 
Thomas Aquinas or Luther, who inﬂuenced the transformation of Christianism. The 
same applies to other religions. There are many divisions and sects within or on 
the fringes of the major religions. Moreover, many theologians, and even religious 
laypeople, make their image of God or the transcendent powers; this image may 
change throughout their biography. 
In this ocean of differences, the analysis within the framework of morphogenetic 
semiotics must ﬁrst focus on the local processes, that is, on the religious individual 
in a spatially and temporally limited situation. The global coordination of indi-
vidual morphogenesis in the family, group, village, country, etc., is a problem where 
secondary functions such as collective emotions, hopes, and fears come to the fore. 
The institutional solidiﬁcation of myth and religion eventually led to a canon of rituals 
and scriptures and the organization of churches, monasteries, parishes, schools, etc. 
They bring to light what the followers of Saussure have called a “system of differ-
ences”. From their point of view, one should understand religion as a shared system of 
beliefs and rules of conduct. The religious creed would be the individual expression or 
the implementation of the suggestions and demands given by the institutionalized reli-
gion. Only the “arbitrary” conventions of a religious community would be relevant. 
The individual spiritual life, the faith, would either be the quasi-automatic imple-
mentation of the system of religion, a partial realization, or even a faulty deviation. 
Explaining the laws underlying the phenomenon of faith and affecting the emergence 
and preservation of religion seems pointless from the perspective of structuralism.

5.2 The Morphogenetic Approach in Religious Studies
97
The observability of the moment of genesis, the religious Big Bang, is limited. 
Therefore, an abductive strategy must be pursued, i.e., more general principles also 
known from other areas are combined with inductive inferences from observations or 
measurements in the phenomenal domain. Because of the variety of religious forms, 
inductive conclusions are either statistical or qualitative in the sense of Max Weber, 
i.e., one tries to work out basic types. The deductive part can, for example, be based 
on general laws of morphogenesis. Such are known both from inanimate and from 
animate nature, and they allow for relevant generalizations. Based on the current 
state of knowledge, these are as follows: 
(a) 
Evolution and emergence laws. They concern, for instance, the origin of species 
(cf. Darwin), the origin of life (cf. the hypercycles of Eigen and Schuster [10]) or, 
in detail, the transition to Homo sapiens, the stages of development of human 
societies, the emergence of human language and visual and musical forms, 
technology, and others. 
(b) Topologically based morphogenetic models. Thom [28] suggested basic types. 
There have been similar approaches since antiquity, in modern times, by Goethe 
(primeval plants and archetypal forms of the skeleton of vertebrates). Thom drew 
the illustrative material from embryogenesis and geology. 
(c) 
Models of self-organization in complex systems. There is a network of subsys-
tems and levels that are interdependent and coordinated with each other. Global 
and stable system behavior is achieved by emphasizing (selecting) individual 
components and eliminating smaller, destabilizing forces or subsystems. Other 
characteristic properties are auto-reference, feedback, and design for the future. 
Self-similar patterns, a form of periodicity, can arise that are relatively inde-
pendent of the substrate and the magnitude of the processes. These phenomena 
look like rule-based “structures” but result from a complex dynamic process 
that lacks planning and rule-following. 
The inductive path starts from local and momentous forms, as can be found in the 
case of religion using historical ﬁgures and relevant contexts. First, scenarios of the 
emergence of the religious are discussed, and a theory of stages in the spatial and 
temporal generalization of the primary emergence is developed. Later, the devel-
opment and transformation of existing religious systems will be described using 
historically witnessed ﬁgures. Two very individual religious founders, Buddha (ﬁfth 
century BC) and Jesus Christ (turn of the era) are good examples that allow for the 
analysis of fundamental principles and processes.

5.3 
The Emergence of Religion3 
As a starting point, one must assume a state of non-religion, which, however, already 
fulﬁlls the requirements for emergence, i.e., rather vague religious orientations. Let 
us take as a starting position non-human primates or preforms of humans, e.g., the 
australopithecines (4–3 million years BP). As with other animals, there are principles 
of self-preservation, securing survival, on the one hand for the individual and on the 
other hand for the group (in the case of herd animals). In addition, there is the 
mother’s care for the baby and, in many cases, extended care of a group of relatives 
for the still-dependent offspring. This example shows that the original principle of 
care allows a quantitative expansion and thus also a structural enrichment, ﬁrst from 
the newly born infant to the group of those born one after the other, who are no longer 
dependent on the mother’s breast. The care activity is expanded such that a group of 
relatives (fathers, aunts, uncles, etc.) takes care of the child. As a result, complexity 
accumulates, and feedback and future projections arise. In the original societies of 
hunters and gatherers, there is also (certainly already in Homo erectus, who made 
stone tools; approx. 1,8 million years ago) distribution of food in the group. This 
evolution “socializes” the care of the offspring or other relatives and food distribution. 
This increase in complexity leads to a higher form of social organization and the 
emergence of a system of values, initially unconsciously but increasingly as a code 
of conduct that also has consequences in the event of non-compliance. At the latest 
with the archaic Homo sapiens, supra-regional networks existed with the exchange 
of rare objects (feathers, attires) and other valuable goods. There was an expansion 
of care for strangers who integrated into society. Simple forms of altruism, that is, 
consideration for others or the adequate distribution of goods, do not yet represent a 
form of religiosity but are on the threshold of emerging ethics. Expanding the social 
space from mother–child to families, networks of relatives, clans, local societies, 
etc., created a precondition for religion. 
Both the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens practiced funeral rituals. Through these 
rituals, a temporal extension of the care beyond death is documented. Those who 
have played an important role in group maintenance and safeguarding are buried or 
burned. From this care of the dead, it is only one step to a cult of the dead, i.e., the dead 
who survive in memory are granted an existence after their death. The spatial and 
temporal extended care leads to the emergence of a behavior pattern that transcends 
the here and now; this can be seen as the ﬁrst level of religious morphogenesis. A 
distinction can be made between two directions: 
a. Temporal projection. The dead do not need care; however, extending care until 
they are buried or cremated makes sense. It is only necessary to transfer the 
existing empathy to the corpse, especially if one is still obliged to this person. This 
decision presupposes that there is an intuitive accounting of social beneﬁts. The 
mother nursing her child has automatic mechanisms of care. For the wider family

to the memory of Per Aage Brandt who died in 2021; cf. Wildgen [45]. 

5.3 The Emergence of Religion
99
and in the case of the distribution of food, socially binding rules must replace 
the missing instincts, i.e., a kind of bookkeeping, a notion of just versus unjust, 
balanced versus unbalanced, emerges. If the span of thanksgiving is extended 
beyond the corpse’s disappearance, the idea of a “life” after death comes forward. 
A cult of the dead arises if this idea is extended in time. The dead continue to 
be cared for; possibly, they can even take revenge in the case of a lack of care. 
In case the row of ancestors is included, such an expansion leads to a myth of 
the group’s origin. The development of a symbolically coded narrative of the 
group’s origin may be extended to humanity. However, this requires a level of 
narrative performance, which was only given to Homo sapiens fully equipped 
with language. 
b. 
Spatial projection. We know that primates migrated between neighboring groups. 
As genetic analyses show, this mainly affected the female members of the groups. 
They could quickly join an adjacent group. The phenomenon of exogamy, histor-
ically veriﬁable for many human cultures, points to the archaic character of 
this migration. In addition, rapid climatic ﬂuctuations have regularly squeezed 
human populations together in narrow spaces. As a result, long-separated and 
genetically isolated groups have mixed and exchanged cultural achievements. 
The cooperative relationships between family members and members of a horde 
were expanded to strangers and thus tended to become a usual strategy. The 
cycles of signiﬁcant environmental changes combined with the densiﬁcation of 
human populations in ecological “survival niches” turned the spontaneous and 
temporary adaptations into a characteristic of the species. This kind of ethical 
globalization is a precondition of religious systems. It does not follow that all 
populations in all geographical areas have developed structures similar to reli-
gions. There may be conditions that have prevented this, e.g., extreme, hostile 
social fragmentation or an anomic social organization (according to Durkheim 
[9]), which abolishes existing or emerging social bonds and blocks a vision of 
that which is beyond ad hoc ethical behavior. 
These major emergence lines created an enriched topology of social space and 
changed the dynamics of social life.4 We can distinguish two axes: 
(1) The spatial axis. Values concerning symbolic objects (jewelry, art) and tech-
nical innovations were applied to larger exchange areas. Extensive networks 
emerged between ecologically separated ethnic groups. These were autonomous 
in everyday life but networked in symbolic and technical areas. 
(2) The temporal axis. Genetic and cultural “memory” expanded the temporal scope 
of ethical and religious values. However, the prerequisite for this was not only 
the cognitive development of episodic and procedural memory but, above all, the 
existence of a collective memory medium. It mainly presupposes sign structures, 
most clearly manifested in a common language. Language connects generations,
4 The concept of “topology of the habitat” was introduced by Lewin [20]. A topology is a local 
space in the neighborhood of a point. Overlapping local topologies can organize into a more or less 
coherent map, a global topology. Geographical maps demonstrate the operation at work; in the case 
of social topologies, constructing a global topology is difﬁcult, as current political crises show.

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
from infants to the eldest, and generations in the past and future. However, the 
temporal depth of language only became fully conscious with the invention of 
writing and thus the permanent ﬁxation of speech. 
A ﬁrst level in this expansion was reached when the caring perspective was 
expanded beyond the infant and the mother’s affectionate behavior to include 
caring for all children of a woman or a group of relatives. The increase in group 
size and the extension of the range of locomotion (cf. Dunbar [8]) resulted in the 
expansion of the behavioral space. This stage should have been reached in the 
transition from LCA (“last common ancestor”), i.e., from the common ancestor 
of humans and chimpanzees to Homo erectus. 
A second level distinguishes, in particular, the social organization of the Nean-
derthals from that of modern humans (Homo sapiens). For example, the culture 
of tools, jewelry, and art (e.g., cave painting) are supra-regional in humans. This 
fact is particularly evident in the Out-of-Africa movement and afterward, i.e., from 
100,000 years on, beginning with the migration inside and outside Africa, later in 
Europe after 50,000 years B.P.5 
A third level was reached with the ﬁrst great empires in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and 
India. It continues to this day. 
The temporal and spatial expansion implies a kind of “transcendence” beyond the 
phenomena of the here and constitutes a prerequisite for religion. Whether this option 
is implemented or society achieves a practical (economic and technical) expansion of 
social space depends on contingent conditions. As the examples of Greek philosophy 
and science, the Italian Renaissance, and Europe after the French Revolution show, 
the option of religious transcendence can also be reversed, even erased. But it can 
come into existence anew as a political ideology, scientiﬁc belief in progress, etc. 
In this respect, religion is not a natural necessity, despite the statistical dominance 
of religious communities. Only the spatial and temporal expansion of the worlds of 
experience and imagination seems to be a general development trend in the evolution 
of Homo sapiens. It remains a mystery why the chimpanzee lineage, our closest 
relatives, did not follow such an itinerary. In the case of the Neanderthals, a tendency 
in this direction can be observed; in competition with modern humans. They may not 
have had the time to take a similar path or to run through it with the same success. 
They survived only as traces in the human genome due to early intermixture. 
In terms of symbolic forms, levels one, two, and three change the reference base 
of possible symbolic systems. At the zero point, only now- and here-states of the ego 
and the immediate neighborhood are part of the discourse universe. The early crying 
of the infant desiring food would, for example, be a gesture of level zero. 
At level one, indicators of space (location, direction, distance) and time emerge. 
They point to the context of immediate action. Those sections of an act that have 
already been carried out (a kind of short-term memory) or the sections of a complex 
of activities that are still outstanding ask for an enlargement of space beyond the
5 New ﬁnds in Borneo suggest that at least 40,000 years ago (40,000 to 52,000 BP estimated), there 
were also Paleolithic cultures in Southeast Asia that produced colored wall paintings (e.g., series 
of handprints and depictions of animals); see Aubert et al. [2]. 

5.4 The Morphogenesis of Religious Forms

immediate present, or “at hand” in the sense of Heidegger’s “Sein und Zeit” [17].6 
A group of hominids on the hunt communicates by observing the behavior of those 
involved, using gestures, and interpreting facial expressions (i.e., without language). 
From level two, spatial projections beyond the familiar environment and temporal 
forecasts into the future (time of shortage in food) or the past (the memory of deceased 
ancestors and their advice) are part of the reference space. The migration beyond the 
accostomed seasonal routes and the imagination of history and the future go beyond 
everyday experience. They create a spatial and temporal “transcendence” as the seed 
for transcendent ideas in religion. This expanded universe of discourse does not have 
to be present to everyone. Still, experienced hunters, group elders, strangers who can 
compare different groups and their way of life, medicine men, and shamans can form 
the crystallization points of an expanded world of discourse. This experience can be 
conveyed horizontally through language and its symbolic function, e.g., in narratives 
and descriptions so that all adults ultimately share it. 
At level three, speciﬁc media are required in addition to a language. The myths, 
rituals, imagery and chants, ethnomedical practices, and divination (see the oracles 
of the Greeks or the bird-ﬂight fortune-tellers of the Romans) form a rich cultural 
canon. In addition, there is writing and the scientiﬁc exploration of space (astronomy, 
geography) and time (history, utopias). 
5.4 
The Morphogenesis of Religious Forms 
The morphogenetic models presented in Thom [28] assume a germ that unfolds 
according to the singularities of simple but unstable dynamic systems described in 
catastrophe theory. More complicated cases, which Thom calls “generalized catastro-
phes” (cf. ibid. 101–107), can lead to fractal patterns or to the self-similar structures 
of chaotic systems in which the attractors of the dynamics develop divergently and 
thus lead to unpredictability. 
From the start, there is no stable transcendent quantity (no attractor), e.g., no 
concept of a hidden entity, a spirit, or a God. Instead, such a concept arises through 
creating or inventing a core meaning with transcendent content. There are several 
scenarios in the history of religions that follow these processes:
• Connections are assumed or sought in the environment to explain signiﬁcant 
phenomena such as birth, death, rescue, and doom. A hidden agent is imagined; 
this imagined entity is then increasingly subordinated to human motives. Prayers, 
sacriﬁces, or magical practices can be used to control this entity. A world of 
spirits or invisible agents gradually emerges in the so-called “natural religions” or 
shamanic rituals. As soon as this world is narratively elaborated and embellished,
6 These conditions are already met by the honeybees’ wagging dance, which they perform when 
they return to the honeycomb. The space extends to the food source and the time ranges from 
discovering this source to reaching the source together with the other "recruited" bees. However, 
the evolutionary framework is different in the case of insects. 

102
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
a polytheistic world of religious entities (gods/goddesses) can appear. The result 
became visible in Homeric epics as a drama with gods/goddesses, demigods, and 
heroes, their heroic deeds, and adventures. Other peoples of the Indo-European 
linguistic family show similar developments, e.g., the Indo-Vedic world of gods 
or the world of the Germanic deities. One can observe this polytheistic world of 
gods in the epics and dramas in which they appear and in the visual arts as a 
cultural achievement with aesthetic qualities and political functions, speciﬁcally 
in sacral or profane architecture.
• For this reason, these religions are not to be reduced to the moment of the transcen-
dent, the divine. On the contrary, they form an overall cultural achievement whose 
fascination hardly diminished with the disappearance of the Greek world of gods. 
After all, it was taken so seriously in the Greek Renaissance that Socrates, who 
did not ﬁght it but only questioned it in his philosophical reﬂection, was sentenced 
to death. Aristotle preferred to emigrate so that the Athenians would not murder 
another philosopher. Athens’ Academy subsequently abandoned the tradition of 
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and other philosophical schools emerged, among 
which the Stoa was the decisive one for several centuries.
• The particular case of a radical reduction of the polytheistic world of forms is 
fascinating. In a long process of meditation and concentration on the essentials, 
Buddha (ﬁfth century BC) ﬁnally reaches a state of enlightenment in which a 
space of light, nirvana, stands for the divine. An intention in the direction of 
transcendence remained, but all content-related ﬁllings were rejected as arbi-
trary embellishments. Comparable to Socrates, who lived some centuries later, 
the chaos of half-truths and imaginary solutions in polytheism was dismantled 
by Budha; emptiness appeared in their place. Although the effect of Buddhism 
on the situation in Palestine or Judaism is not very likely, Jesus also performed 
such a “puriﬁcation” concerning Judaism of his time; it later became his doom. He 
cleaned the temple, where the more or less non-believing high priests (Sadducees) 
did business and accepted that the Romans conﬁrm their ofﬁce or sell it to them. 
He cleansed the law-abiding regulatory apparatus of the Pharisees, who accused 
him of healing the sick on the Sabbath. As Buddha was the founding ﬁgure 
for “religious cleaners”, Jesus is one of his successors. This series also includes 
Savonarola, a fact emphasized by Luther in the Reformation. The reformers them-
selves: Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli, also belong to this tradition. The successors of 
Buddha tried to maintain this radical position in the ﬁrst centuries after his death. 
When Buddhism became the state religion in India with the Maurya dynasty 
and primarily through King Ashoka (approx. 324–232 BC), there was a slow but 
steady turn of 180 degrees. The founder, Buddha, was worshiped, depicted in 
monumental sculptures, and became an object of worship. In the sense of Thom’s 
morphogenesis, the eradication of the attractor “God”, its dissolution in “nir-
vana”, was reversed. The polytheistic attractor, which had been abolished but was 
still present in the Hindu environment of Buddhism in India, was re-established 
and served as a receptacle for new and old contents. In the end, Buddhism disap-
peared from India, where it now forms a religious minority roughly on the scale of 
Catholicism (in Sri Lanka, a variant transferred from southern India to the island

(Feigenbaum diagram) 
has remained the majority religion to this day). Nevertheless, the story continued 
as a northern branch of Buddhism spread to East Asia. Since the religious concepts 
in Confucianism and Taoism had a similar tendency to Buddhism, insofar as they 
assumed a rather abstract transcendence of principles, the possibility of integration 
for Buddhist innovation was more favorable than in India.
The two basic types mentioned above can be schematized with the help of basic 
notions of catastrophe theory (cf. Wildgen [34, 36]) (Fig. 5.1). 
The development may be stopped or frozen in the transition between simple 
and iterated bifurcations (see the Feigenbaum diagram above). A ﬁnite bifurcation 
sequence leads to a branching or tree pattern, i.e., to a hierarchical system that mimics 
systems existing in social reality, for instance, the hierarchy of ruling persons in a 
monarchy or an oligarchy, the order of kinsfolk. Natural morphogenesis in the organic 
and social world is the template for the morphogenesis of gods/goddesses or ethical 
principles. 
The Greek and Roman heaven of gods/goddesses is a quasi-lexical hierarchy that 
mimics former monarchic or oligarchic political structures. However, in the polis, 
the democratically organized society of Athens, such a monarchic organization of 
heaven, did not match the everyday experience of the citizen. It was Socrates who 
became aware of this inconsistency. However, the majority in the agora, the forum of 
democratic decisions, voted for his death, arguing that he was misleading the youth 
of Athens and acting against religion. 
5.4.1 
The Origin of Religious Time and the Role of Memory 
in Religion 
It is characteristic of many, but not all, religions that time has a beginning in God’s 
act of creation. This beginning is often placed in a historical epoch, e.g., determined 
based on genealogical tables (see the calculations based on the information in the 
Bible, for example, in the King James Bible from 1701, which sets October 23, 4004 
BC as the ﬁrst day of creation). The end of time is open; this is God’s eternity and 
heaven’s kingdom. Humanity on this earth often ends with a judgment of the world

104
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
(Germanic myth) or the Last Judgment (Gospel). The opposition of ﬁniteness (man) 
and inﬁnity (God) seems fundamental to many religions.7 
In the lifeworld and human cognition, temporality is closely linked to memory; 
it exists and is shaped there. Religious experiences and their contexts (times, places, 
and people) shape individual memories in religious communication. They are crucial 
when religious content is repudiated or accepted and passed on to new generations. 
This transmission is vital because it shapes the collective memory and may become 
a moment of stability in the community’s life. It may be called the past dimension of 
religion. Equally important, however, are the instantiation, the application of religious 
knowledge in new situations, and its further development. This feature can be called 
the future dimension of religious symbols and semiosis. Suppose religion cannot ﬁll 
the past, especially one’s biography, with meaning and provides no useful instructions 
or perspectives for the future (life, society, world) to follow. In that case, it loses its 
value and is given up, negated, or even fought with passion. The two axes: past and 
future, will be treated separately. 
5.4.2 
The Past Dimension of Religious Signs 
Today’s religious communities refer to a historical and regional origin, e.g., the 
Hebrew Bible (Pentateuch) to Abraham, Mesopotamia, and (estimated) the 2nd 
millennium BC; Buddhism refers to northern India and the sixth century BC. Chris-
tianism refers to Jesus (Palestine, ﬁrst century). In many religions, the historical 
epoch is uncertain, or reference is made to a mythical early period. Nevertheless, 
this time and this place are regarded as decisive, i.e., all other events are related to 
the time of origin, to the time of God’s revelation in the case of Abraham, Moses, 
Jesus, Mohammed, or the “awakening” of Buddha under the Bodhi tree. Although 
the emphasis is on the immutability of the source experience, the history of religion 
makes it clear that religion has been decisively expanded, developed, and redesigned. 
At a historical time (e.g., today), a sign-bound (or text- and image-bound) memory 
forms the basis of faith and religious practice. Parts of this culture of remembrance 
can be negated, so the Reformation tried to deny the contribution of the Church 
Fathers and the papal or conciliar elaboration of Christian teaching. Some religions 
try to eradicate the remembrance of foreign faiths, i.e., there is a ﬁght for displace-
ment between the religious cultures of memory. Mosaic Judaism erased the traces 
of the polytheistic culture, i.e., it destroyed the images of their gods. The Christians 
destroyed sacred trees in Germania or evidence of ancient American religions after 
the discovery and colonization of America. Mohammed destroyed the images of 
gods set up in the Kaa’ba, and the Taliban blew up the Buddha statues of Bamiyan 
in 2008. Book burnings by the Inquisition and similar incidents worldwide belong to 
the same line. In a way, this is a kind of magical ritual. By destroying an important
7 For Paul Tillich, the idea of inﬁnity is a deﬁning element of religion. In many cases, however, this 
would arbitrarily exclude myths and religions that are based in the ﬁnite; cf. Tillich ([31]: 73). 

5.4 The Morphogenesis of Religious Forms
105
symbol of the religion, one believes in destroying the religion as a whole. Even the 
Holocaust is based on a magic practice designed to destroy Judaism. 
As a complement, one can also speak of a command to remember. This command 
is evident, for example, in Germany’s post-war culture and the memory of the Shoah, 
the extermination of the Jews in the concentration camps of the Nazi regime. The 
perpetrators and their sympathizers want things to be forgotten, to make the topic 
taboo in public. The victims and the people who fear a repetition of similar events 
or wish to prevent them make efforts to set such signs, for example, by memorials 
either at the site of the event, the former concentration camps, or politically central 
locations. Figure 5.2 shows in the foreground the monument of the Holocaust in 
Berlin. It stands close to two other important landmarks, the Brandenburg Gate and 
the German federal parliament (Bundestag; former Reichstag) with its dome. This 
parallelism emphasizes the central relevance of the Holocaust memorial because the 
importance of the other two buildings in its neighborhood is undisputed. 
The command to remember must be seen against the background of the automatic 
processes of forgetting and the disappearance of contemporary witnesses. However, 
one can neither stop the disappearance of memory nor plaster the urban landscape 
with memorials. Such memories soon lose their meaning if not kept alive through

rituals. For example, a museum is attached to the Holocaust memorial, in which this 
memory can be kept alive through guided tours. 
5.4.3 
The Future Dimension of Religion 
On the one hand, the transcendence of religious symbols means that the afterlife, 
life after death, and hopes for justice that could not be fulﬁlled on earth come into 
focus. On the other hand, the commandments of religion result in expectations and 
norms that determine the actions of the believer in his future life. This attitude shapes 
the immediate future. One’s biography, the life of the deceased, and that of one’s 
children gain meaning within the framework. A temporal repetition is programmed in 
the religious ritual. On the one hand, there are sequences of events in time; on the other 
hand, everything remains the same because the ritual cycle is constantly repeated. Life 
always returns to the same point; in Judaism, every week for the Sabbath celebration, 
every year for the holidays: Hanukkah, Purim, Yom Kippur, etc. The week is marked 
by the Sabbath (Jews), Sunday (Christians), or Friday (Islam); the year is subdivided 
by festivals (Christmas and Easter in Christianism). In addition, the days may be 
divided by prayers. This pattern is particularly evident in the monastic rule, e.g., the 
Benedictine rule. Monastic life is a ﬂow ordered by constant repetition. Even the 
afterlife can be articulated, for example, in an intermediate zone between heaven and 
hell (limbo), in purgatory, as a place of transition for sinners who have to serve their 
sentence before going to heaven. 
After the loss of their leading ﬁgure, Jesus Christ, the early Christians urgently 
expected his speedy return, which would still take place in their lifetime and, with 
it, the Last Judgment and the Kingdom of Heaven for the believers. Underlying this 
expectation is a turning point, i.e., a sudden, dramatic change that will reshufﬂe all the 
cards; all conditions that have hitherto been valid were considered overthrown. Tillich 
[30] introduced the term “Kairos” (in contrast to “Chronos”) for this expectation. 
The neutral time (Chronos) is interrupted and articulated by a signiﬁcant moment 
or phase of upheaval. After two centuries, this belief in an imminent solution to all 
tribulations was no longer tenable. It was now assumed that the dead would have to 
remain in a waiting position until the Last Judgment. 
Some political ideologies have developed a crass vision of the future. Hitler 
expected a thousand-year Reich; Marxism adopted historical iron laws through 
which the ﬁnal state, communism, must necessarily come about. Here, too, results 
were repeatedly frustrating. Nevertheless, even if all expectations are disappointing, 
believing in a speciﬁc future is the fundamental force of all religions and ideologies.

5.4 The Morphogenesis of Religious Forms

5.4.4 
The Dynamics of the End Times (Apocalypse) 
and Religious Anamnesis 
The historical experiences of the decline of great empires and the occurrence of 
ecological catastrophes are extrapolated to the future. The signs of decay, death, 
and destruction herald the end of the world. Such ideas are found in many ancient 
cultures; they are believed to have derived from Chaldean and Zoroastrian religions, 
spreading to Hellenistic myths and eventually to Judaism and Christianity. In the 
Indo-European myths, we ﬁnd the end of the world, the world conﬂagration in the 
Ragnarök of Germanic mythology, and the Pralaya of the Indian Mahabharata. In 
the Greek saga of Orpheus in the underworld, the world of destruction, of hell, is 
described in detail and later elaborated in a literary and topographical form in Dante’s 
Inferno. In many cases, there is a cyclical vision of the world’s end. For example, a 
short cycle appears in the Deluge narrative; Abraham concludes a contract with God 
in which God promises not to deliver the world to another deluge. 
The local event of beginning/end or birth/death can be expanded globally via a 
“pars pro toto”-metaphor. Individual biographical or historical experiences of doom 
are generalized to the world, the cosmos. A general cause is assumed to be the 
invariant behind birth and death dynamics. For instance, a capricious, vengeful god 
dissatisﬁed with his creation appears. Individual suffering and illness are attributed 
to disobedience or insufﬁcient sacriﬁce to a demanding god. 
Another religious constellation of forces goes back to the Persian dualism of 
God versus Satan. God has a Janus-shaped, ambivalent character; the negative pole 
becomes Satan. This tradition was partially adopted in Judaism and Christianity. 
Satan is a spin-off from the realm of angels or spirits who serve God. He is banished to 
Hell with some of Heaven’s staff, where he establishes his empire. Consequently, the 
Antichrist can also be conceived as the opposite pole to Christ. Elaborate Antichrist 
mythologies make him appear as a negative mirror-design of Christ. The passion of 
Christ is interpreted as the world’s end and the beginning of the kingdom of God. 
In the Gospel, the sun stands still, and darkness spreads when Jesus dies on the 
cross.8 The creation of the kingdom of God, i.e., the restoration of a (better) world, 
corresponds diagrammatically to the resurrection of Christ. 
Concrete historical experiences also shape the horizon of expectation of the 
prophets, who warn of a foreseeable future. In the second century BC, Antiochus IV 
threatened Judaism, dedicated the temple in Jerusalem to Zeus and Baal, neglected 
the Sabbath commandment, and forbade circumcision. The prophet Daniel proph-
esied his fall and the triumph of Israel over him. The rebellion of the Maccabees 
seemed to conﬁrm Daniel’s prophecy, for, under their leadership, a Jewish rule arose 
that lasted until 63 BC when Pompey conquered Jerusalem.9 Daniel’s apocalyptic 
writing thus extrapolated an actual conﬂict situation (a civil war in Israel and Judah) 
and the hopes for a Jewish kingdom in the future. The Christian Apocalypse of
8 Cf. Matthew 27:45 and 51–54, and similarly in Luke 23:44–48 and Mark 15:44–48. 
9 One can also understand the prophecy as a call, a program, and an encouragement. The prophecy 
is ﬁnally fulﬁlled through it, which might not have happened without the prophet’s vision. 

108

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
John leans very closely on Daniel’s style and content; in addition, there were other 
apocalypses in the Hellenistic area at the time of its creation that could serve as inspi-
ration.10 We are therefore dealing with indirect morphogenesis because the existing 
apocalyptic texts and a situation of threat, fears, and hopes are used to update and 
vary existing apocalyptic designs. 
Similar reorganizations of existing traditions shape the life and teachings of Jesus. 
He refuses to be a political leader or a prophet of political rebellion, as Daniel and 
the Maccabees did two centuries earlier. At feeding the 5000 at the Sea of Galilee, he 
deceives the expectations of the masses and boards a ship that takes him to the other 
side of the lake; he practically ﬂees, confronted with the population’s expectations. 
When he is nailed to the cross, along with two other rebels against the Romans, he 
is mocked by the attached plaque “King of the Jews”, which refers ironically to the 
role he has refused. 
Apocalyptic visions found their way into the canon of the New Testament as 
“Revelation of John”. Iconic and diagrammatic references, dynamic opposites, and 
cyclical decay- and renewal events have their indexical foundation in the natural 
processes everyone can observe. Through the handing down of written reports, they 
are projected onto the past and the future. The inclusion of past events in a religion, 
for instance, the Passion of Christ in Christianism, is called anamnesis. It renders 
the memory of dramatic moments or signiﬁcant passages in the history of a religion 
(cf. the “rites of passage” introduced to ethnology by Arnold van Gennep, 1872– 
1957). Birth and death are such passages and may be commemorated by rituals; the 
apocalypse is the generalization of the passage from life to the death of a community 
or humankind. 
Apocalypses are also omnipresent in modern industrial and media societies. Refer-
ence has already been made to forming myths in political and ideological contexts. 
In the last 50 years, there have been many apocalyptic ﬁlms,11 f.i.: The Last Shore 
(1959), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Bladerunner (1982), The Matrix (1999), and 
Terminator. The Redemption (2009). Released in recent years: 2017: World War Z, 
2018: Quiet Place and Bird Box. These developments will continue because politics 
motivate multiple fears of environmental catastrophes, e.g., nuclear disasters, climate 
catastrophes, viral epidemics, or a new world war. The media also pounce on every 
kind of minor catastrophe, whether in the private circle of celebrities or criminal and 
terrorist activities. Social networks are also full of them. At ﬁrst glance, all of this 
has little to do with religion, but these events go beyond the usual horizon of experi-
ence, are transcendent, and require explanations. The readily available descriptions
10 Éliade ([11]: 187) points to the Hellenistic tradition of the apocalypses originating in the Orphic 
visions of the torments of hell. In addition to the Jewish tradition of the prophets, the revelation of 
John also refers to the Hellenistic context (the Roman province of Asia). 
11 Some of the ﬁlms take up novel-like material again. For example, they refer to science ﬁction 
literature, which has been rising since the nineteenth century. The successful authors of the nine-
teenth century were Jules Verne and H.J. Wells. In the twentieth century, science ﬁction (since 
around 1937) became the domain of German (e.g., Herbert Franke), American, Russian, Polish 
(e.g., Stanislaw Lemb), and Japanese authors.

5.5 
Religious Morphogenesis Described 
with the Techniques of Catastrophe Theory 
In his book “Structural stability and morphogenesis”, René Thom has linked morpho-
genesis in biology and pattern formation in nature and culture. As means of gener-
alization, he used the mathematical results of differential topology, speciﬁcally the 
classiﬁcation theorem of catastrophe theory. Basic notions are the structural insta-
bility of dynamic systems beyond elementary quadratic functions, for instance, the 
parabola expressed in equation V= x2. A pendulum may illustrate this simple dynam-
ical system. In a dense material, the pendulum goes directly to its resting position. The 
point of rest is the minimum of the parabola. The negative parabola has an unstable 
extremum, a maximum (compare Fig. 5.1, at the left). These maximally simple 
process patterns can be elaborated and deepened using the classiﬁcation theorem of 
catastrophe theory (cf. Wildgen [34]: 7–18 and Wildgen [37]: 45–56).12 
5.5.1 
The Birth of a Religious Attractor (Hidden Force 
or God) 
In the following, we argue that the morphogenesis of religions follows such basic 
dynamic patterns, speciﬁcally in the period of their instantiation. Later more compli-
cated dynamics appear. In the context of this book, such a dynamic is sketched 
without going into the mathematical details. In Wildgen [44], formal model sketches 
are presented, and in Wildgen [34, 36], the underlying epistemology and the 
mathematical techniques of catastrophe theory are explained. 
The fold is the ﬁrst system with a stable unfolding, i.e., a change process.13 
Figure 5.3 shows the development of the dynamic nucleus (called singularity). Below 
this diagram, the same state of affairs is represented by vector ﬂows. They go toward 
the attractor, away from the repellor, or stop at the level point.
This process takes place on many occasions and concerns. Many individual deci-
sions create a space of coexisting nodes (attractors, repellors). The heaven of gods
12 The classiﬁcation theorem of catastrophe theory proves that a series of structurally unstable 
dynamical systems (singularities) allow for a structurally stable unfolding, i.e., stability exists even 
in processes following an instability. However, many chaotic and aleatory processes exist beyond 
these stable and recurrent types of processes. For scientiﬁc purposes, the primary aim should be to 
understand the recurrent, stable processes and later expand the analysis to chaotic or even aleatory 
processes. 
13 It has the potential equation V = x3. One parameter controls its stable unfolding, the variable u 
in Vu = x3 + ux (cf. Wildgen [36]: 111–118).

Fig. 5.3 The emergence of a concept of God from an unbalanced system of beliefs
is a consequence of continued morphogenesis that follows this pattern. The orig-
inal religious need (the “pregnancy” in the sense of Thom [29], cf. Sect. 1.4 of this 
book) is distributed over many centers (attractors) and thus ultimately reduced in 
its substance, possibly even nulliﬁed. On the other hand, the diversity of religious 
attractors enables an aesthetic elaboration, which can at least partially compensate for 
pregnancy loss. An aesthetic, cultural one replaces the biologically rooted pregnancy. 
5.5.2 
The Implosion of a Polytheistic Religious Universe 
The founder of a new religion (e.g., Buddha) can reduce this exuberant diversity to 
a minimum, ultimately to nothing. The polytheistic multiplicity creates a religious 
environment where life and the hustle and bustle are omnipresent (the panorama of 
the Pergamon Altar in Berlin, https://www.asisi.de, is a good illustration). Buddha, 
on the other hand, meditates in silence under his tree. Buddha’s “negative theology” is 
maintained for a long time by the community of wandering monks until the political 
success of his religion sets in, and Buddhism puts the charismatic personality of 
Buddha into the slot of the former God (one of the gods, the most prominent one). 
The reintroduction of a divine attractor is not a repetition of the original morpho-
genesis of many spirits or gods, inferred from a vague recognition of hidden natural 
forces. Instead, the reduced form continued to be surrounded by a polytheistic culture. 
The ﬁgure of the founder offered itself as an anchor for the reintroduction of a central 
attractor. The Buddhist doctrine of life remained attached to him such that at least 
Buddha’s mundane and human message was preserved. In the Far Eastern form 
of Buddhism, there was integration with the ideas of Confucianism and Taoism, 
whereby parts of the Buddhist heritage found a continuation.14 The underlying
14 The history of Chinese religion and philosophy is too complicated to be discussed here. Buddism 
had a strong inﬂuence during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and led to a Chinese variant of Zen 
Buddhism, which later expanded to Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The classical positions of Confu-
cianism and Taoism remained points of orientation. Confucianism is still inﬂuential indirectly via

Fig. 5.4 Reduction of a rich landscape of forces and rebirth of a religious attractor 
dynamics are much more complicated than the re-emergence of a central attractor in 
Fig. 5.4 can show. 
The reduction is relevant for the overall dynamics of human religions insofar as 
the original motivation was lost in the diffraction of polytheistic gods and goddesses. 
The religiosity of polytheism was a burden for the believers they could not shoulder. 
They became dependent on mediators, priests, scribes, and theologians and were 
ultimately at their mercy. 
5.6 
The Self-Organization of a Complex Religious System. 
The Case of Christianism 
In the previous sections, ﬁrst, very global stages of development and, second, more 
local morphogenetic structures were discussed. In between are the “systems”, i.e., 
accumulations of religious motifs and the organization of a network of relevant 
connections. The quantitative increase of mythical and religious motifs and their 
systematizations lead to self-organization. The drastic reduction (selection) in self-
organization secures that only a few parameters determine the qualitative behavior 
of the system and make it understandable and teachable. Other factors are damp-
ened or eliminated. Self-organization comes forward mainly at branch points, where 
new solutions appear. Despite its complexity, the system becomes roughly control-
lable and, therefore, understandable. In the case of religious self-organization, histor-
ical, qualitative modeling is the nearby option. In the following, two basic types of 
religious self-organization are described in more detail:
• The emergence of the main attraction, Jesus Christ, and the construction of his 
divinity.
• The emergence of the cult of Mary in the early Christian church.
its pragmatic attitude centered on governance and public virtues. Mao Zedong made Marxism, 
Historical Materialism, and thus Atheism the dominant philosophical and religious teaching.

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
In the Gospels, the person Jesus, his actions, and his speaking are clearly at the 
center. His life story is described as a movement toward cruciﬁxion and resurrection 
(ascension). However, after his death, a large void is created ﬁrst. Christ as a miracle 
healer and speaker, as a teacher, is no longer in the world. He can no longer be 
addressed personally or asked for help and advice. Instead, he lives on in the memory 
of the direct and indirect witnesses. 
In the ﬁnal scene of the cruciﬁxion, only the women “who followed him when 
he was in Galilee” (Mark 15:40) are among the audience. In the Gospel, women 
appear repeatedly, but the disciples stand in the foreground. These are now fright-
ened, hide, or even deny that they are acquainted with Jesus, like Peter. One can 
assume that the painful vacancy of the leader, the leading ﬁgure in this situation, 
is at least emotionally compensated for by the women. The further development of 
Christianism up to Constantine’s Tolerance seems to have essentially been in the 
hands of committed women. This feature is understandable insofar as the teaching 
of Jesus focuses on charity and the relationship between man and woman. These 
contents probably appealed to women, and they still do today. In this reorientation 
process, a second attractor emerges, which crystallizes in the person of the mother of 
Jesus, Mary. Our analysis examines the two attractors and shows how content-related 
elaborations and reinterpretations pile up around them. It is no longer enough to have 
a nameless god and to strictly follow his complicated set of rules (the Pharisees) or to 
make enough sacriﬁces in the temple to satisfy the priesthood (the Sadducees). The 
religious pregnancy must be concentrated on ideal persons who can be addressed in 
the imagination and a quasi-dialogical prayer. The Israelite god of law or war could 
not meet this expectation, particularly pronounced among the ordinary people. Jesus 
forms the center in the ﬁrst phase, i.e., as long as he is still alive (or present). Later, 
a second focus was created, Mary, the mother of Jesus. However, with the addition 
of these attractors, the original monotheistic God was pushed into a secondary role. 
The early Church and later the Reformation had to try, if not to solve the difﬁculties 
of this unusual and, according to Gestalt laws, unbalanced constellation, at least to 
avoid evident inconsistencies. 
5.6.1 
The First Attractor: Jesus Christ 
The ﬁrst question concerns the nature of the force that characterizes the personality 
of Jesus. It allowed him to persuade a large public (but not the religious authori-
ties) and to attract many followers (the twelve apostles and numerous women who 
followed him to Jerusalem). Several members of the Jewish elite supported him and 
got permission to descend his corpse from the cross and place it in a private tomb. 
These effects point to the characteristic form of Jesus’ life, his “Lebensform” in the 
sense of Wittgenstein. His fundamental decisions were against the role of political 
messiah, his rejection of the dominant religious tendencies in Jerusalem: the temple 
cult and the absoluteness of religious rules. He underwent the injustice and violence 
of the high priests and suffered the indifferent brutality of the Roman authorities

(his death). His spiritual message deviated from all contemporary variants of the 
Jewish religion. It is not easy to guess the background of his originality. Still, the 
enaction of his life15 and the contours of his personality, as far as the gospel makes 
them transparent, were decisive not only for the continuity of Christianism after the 
disappearance of Jesus. They were necessary as a point of orientation in all reforms 
of Christianism, i.e., in the required corrections enabling to repair of the losses due 
to a shift in the direction of dominating contextual forces, internal corruption of 
the institutions after the tolerance edict of Constantine, and the establishment of a 
church. 
The person Jesus, who is recognized by John the Baptist as a prophet continuing 
his work, ﬁrst presents himself as a reformer of Judaism. In conﬂict with the high 
priests, who control the temple service (and make a living from it), and the Pharisees, 
demanding strict adherence to all rules, he tries to convince them with his humane 
message but ultimately has to bow to violence. In addition, he rejects the expectation 
of forcing an end to the foreign rule of the Romans as the Messiah. All of this takes 
place within the framework of the Jewish faith. When it comes to a conﬂict with the 
high priests, to whom he is brought before as a prisoner, Jesus says (according to the 
report of the evangelists) that he is not only God’s Son, which can mean many things 
but is God. This utterance was blasphemy and worth the death penalty for the high 
priests. At the cruciﬁxion, he is mocked as a usurper by the inscription “King of the 
Jews”. 
In the ﬁrst centuries of Christianity, the question of how being human and being 
God are related to one another is discussed. It becomes the central point of contention 
and the cause of the ﬁrst splits, e.g., the Arians. A question that cannot be answered 
in retrospect is: Did Jesus take the radical turn from the Jewish prophet and reformer 
to his self-determination as God alongside the only God of Israel himself (e.g., in the 
face of death) or did the Christian community under the impression of Resurrection 
interpret Jesus in this sense? 
Mohammed, the founder of Islam (c. 570–632), concedes Jesus has a signiﬁ-
cant role in the prehistory of Islam but rejects its deiﬁcation as incompatible with 
monotheism. For him, Jesus remains one prophet among several. Mohammed was 
threatened with death in Mecca, as was Jesus in Jerusalem. After his military victo-
ries, he established a theocracy under his leadership, which was later expanded under 
his successors. In the religious tradition, he and his successors became the spiritual 
anchor of the Islamic faith. Although not deiﬁed, Mohammed, as well as the canon 
of writings that go back to him or are legitimized by him, became the central attractor 
of Islam. 
In late antiquity and before the emergence of Islam, Augustine of Hippo (354– 
430 AD) suggested the formula of the Trinity as a possible synthesis. To this end, 
the “Holy Spirit”, often represented as a dove or a ﬁre sign over the believer, was 
introduced as the third magnitude. References to a third power appear in the Acts
15 Enaction is a term pointing to action in context. Basic contributions to enactivism were made by 
J.J. Gibson (ecological psychology), theories of the embodied mind and in the context of dynamic 
system theory.

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
of the Apostles appended to the Gospel of Luke (Acts 2, 3): “And tongues appeared 
to them divided as if by ﬁre; and it sat on each of them”. The trinity of Jesus–God 
the Father–Holy Spirit now stands for the One God and guarantees the monotheistic 
character of Christian teaching. With the theological reshaping, Christianism left 
self-organization and became an argumentatively and rationally established faith. 
This process dominates the controversies surrounding Christianism to this day. At 
the same time, the religious doctrine breaks away from simple popular belief and 
becomes a kind of “secret doctrine” of the specialists. 
On the one hand, this duplicity had the consequence that there appeared long-
lasting co-evolution of theology, philosophy, and science, in which, however, 
theology claimed predominance. However, on the other hand, in the ﬁfteenth and 
sixteenth centuries, the leading function of theology and, thus, of the church was 
questioned, and the conﬂict between theology and science became virulent. It persists 
particularly in the evangelical churches of America. 
5.6.2 
The Second or Additional Attractor: The Cult of Mary 
If one follows the account of the Gospel of Mark, there appear women who meet 
and speak with Jesus. Among them, there was, to the horror of the Pharisees, even a 
Samaritan woman from the northern kingdom and an adulteress. It can be assumed 
that both Jesus and his disciples had female partners since unmarried men were not 
accepted in Judaism. In addition, according to the Gospels, a relevant female group 
following from Galilee accompanied Jesus to Jerusalem. Still, it is astonishing that 
the mother of Jesus, Mary, was able to take a position that made her almost the 
third person next to the God of Israel and Jesus. The key could be the scene under 
the cross, when essentially Mary (as well as other women) and the disciple John, 
whom Jesus recommended to his mother as a quasi-replacement son, stood under the 
cross. The other disciples stayed in hiding, and even Peter, the rock, was supposed 
to deny Jesus three times before the ﬁrst cockcrow. The expansion of the original 
constellation centered on the attractor Jesus had far-reaching consequences for the 
attractiveness and vitality of Christianism in the Hellenistic and Roman worlds. 
The further development of the cult of Mary is closely related to the dispute 
over the divine or human nature of Christ. In the Council of Ephesus (431), which 
has dogmatically ﬁxed Mary’s virginity, Mary was called the Theotokos (the person 
who gave birth to God). She became a mediator between God the Father and Jesus 
and was closer to popular belief than the more abstract construction of Jesus as 
simultaneously human and God. In the Proto-Gospel of Jacobus, Mary’s birth is 
announced to her mother, Anna, by an angel (cf. Ceming and Werlitz [7]: 73), i.e., 
Mary’s annunciation is set back one generation. Mary is seen as a human being born 
thanks to divine providence. The Proto-Gospel, which probably originated in Egypt 
in the second century AD, is viewed in the Catholic Church as apocryphal and outside 
the canon. However, it had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the Eastern Church. It was also

perceived as an authentic narrative in art, for example, in the rock grotto Madonna 
by Leonardo da Vinci (cf. Wildgen [39]). 
In the context of the religions known in the Orient at the time of early Christianity, 
the tradition of great female deities may also have played a role. These include the 
Egyptian cult of Isis and, in the Greek context, the goddesses Athena and Artemis; the 
latter was also referred to as a virgin. Even further in the background, the Babylonian 
fertility goddess Ishtar or the Phrygian Great Mother of God Cybele may have been 
the model. 
5.7 
Religious Topographies. The Bororo Village and Routes 
of Pilgrimage 
Since the symbolic forms and their use depend constitutively on the human body, 
its movement, and its actions in space, religious signs are also embedded in the area 
of movements and actions. They form an abstract space derived from the space of 
movement and action, in which both human actions and imagined worlds have their 
place. This space can be experienced vividly and most clearly in architecture. If one 
enters a Christian church, e.g., a baroque or rococo church in Southern Germany, the 
ceiling often shows a view of heaven populated by angels. The main altar depicts 
central ﬁgures of the history of salvation and prominent ﬁgures of saints greeting 
from the side altars and the walls; the faithful can follow the ﬁnal phase in the life of 
Christ, his “Passion”. During the mass, the sound of the organ ﬁlls the church room, 
and a polyphonic choir praises God. The heavy church bells and the light bells of 
the acolytes complete the heavenly impressions. In Rococo churches, the staging of 
religion gives the impression of a theatrical performance. Religion and theater are 
close to each other; both contribute to our “spatial memory”. 
In myth, especially in the archaic forms of totem cultures, there is a much more 
direct connection between space and myth. Lévi-Strauss described this in detail in 
his analysis of totem cultures in South America (Lévi-Strauss [19]: Mythologiques). 
Here the concrete, everyday living space is symbolically subdivided, and this myth-
ical space controls the paths of social action in the village. The spatial organization 
of the village, its divisions, the living areas, and the respective accessibility for the 
individuals have their foundation in the myth, which in turn determines the ritual 
practices. For example, the Bororo village (in Brazil) makes visible the division of a 
social group into clans, into halves (“moiety”) of the dual organization of a village; 
in the present case, the village community is organized by exogamic principles; see 
Lévi-Strauss ([19]: 48f.). In the middle is the men’s house. The women’s shelters 
form a circle with additional axes and subdivisions. They deﬁne the edges of the 
polygon inscribed in the circle of the village. Married men regularly move between 
the men’s houses and their wives’ homes. The axes of this geometric conﬁguration 
are either deﬁned concerning the movement of the sun or a local geographical entity. 
In the Bororo village, this is the river that ﬂows along the village (Fig. 5.5).

and C-D separates the so-called clans. The line C-D is roughly oriented north–south. Line A-B 
follows the direction of the river; it separates the Cera and Tugaré groups (which also determine 
the marital networks) 
The clans and other social divisions visible in the plan of the village are also 
marked by “emblems, by privileges […] ﬁnally by ceremonies, songs and proper 
names” (Lévi-Strauss [19]: 51; translation by W.W.). The myth forms the background 
of rites and ceremonies. Therefore, we have a symbolic complex that ranges from 
the spatial organization, daily paths, and routines to rituals and traditional myths. 
We can say that there is an underlying spatial organization that is very stable in daily 
practice because of its visibility and its organizing role. This spatial organization 
reﬂects the social classiﬁcations (e.g., kinship networks) and, ﬁnally, the structure 
and dynamics of myths. In short, the symbolic organization is related to the topology 
(geometry) of the habitat and the movements in that space. The spatial properties: 
center, periphery, orientation (global, local), and the dividing axes into two, four, and 
eight parts visualize the underlying structure and the types of actions appropriate 
within that framework (see Wildgen [43, 44]; 124–129 for more details).

5.7 Religious Topographies. The Bororo Village and Routes of Pilgrimage
117
Religious art is a kind of spatial realization of religion in those faiths that do not 
know a ban on images. The images in which biblical scenes or scenes from the life 
of a saint are depicted are like tiny windows into religious imagery. The viewers can 
compose their private religious world from this lexicon of images. They can create 
their album with their favorite people, such as Mary or Jesus (e.g., as a child in the 
crib). When they move around in the everyday world of work, family, or leisure, 
they can use this world of pictures as a background, as a foundation of meaning. 
At ﬁxed times, when the bells are ringing, in church, in the cemetery, or during 
processions in the ﬁelds, the religious motion patterns are combined with everyday 
experience. Especially when everyday life is difﬁcult, oppressive, and uncertain, it 
becomes bearable through this secondary space rooted in religion. 
In those religions that ban images, the visual organization and the imaginary reli-
gious space are absent. What takes their place? As a linear sequence of sentences, 
the written sources do not have an organization comparable to the geometric-
geographical spatial structure.16 However, even in those post-Reformation circles 
in which the Bible text (in the vernacular) became the central point of reference, 
believers do not orient themselves to the entirety of the texts of the biblical canon. 
Instead, the simple layman uses a personal selection of the contents and can choose 
a few central topoi to construct a conceptual space of low dimensionality. 
As early as the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church did a great deal to remedy or at 
least compensate for the exclusion of believers from the actual ritual performed by the 
priests. Solemn processions, in which many participants, often arranged according 
to status and gender, could play their part, passion plays, and scenic depictions of the 
life of Christ and the saints allowed the population to participate in the religious world 
of ideas and be actively integrated into the religious world.17 There are comparable 
structures in many other religions. This proximity to the believer is the function of 
the rituals, masquerades, dances, and musical performances with broad participation 
of the population. Thus, the crowds of believers who travel to Mecca move through 
the holy places in a ﬁxed ritual and circle the central sanctuary. The pilgrimage 
movements sanctify a global network of paths (see the pilgrimage to Santiago de 
Compostela). One can map the whole of Western Europe using the pilgrimage routes. 
Like the network of paths in an insect colony, the pilgrims measure their continent 
on foot and thus construe a symbolic map roughly parallel to physical geography.18 
16 After all, the representation is two-dimensional in an abstract sense, since the one-dimensional 
syntagmatic space of linguistic chain formation is augmented by the second dimension of 
paradigmatic relationships, the alternatives in the respective choice of lexemes or constructions. 
17 When the small town Oberammergau (Bavaria) made a vow (in 1634), obliging it to organize 
a passion play every ten years, more than a hundred places were known for their passion plays. 
However, only the passion play in Oberammergau subsists. The author witnessed the 2022 version 
together with more than 4000 spectators. The actors are exclusively citizens of Oberammergau; 
this means that the play is part of the community life. The actions of Christ, his followers, and 
adversaries are enacted and thus brought into the immediate neighborhood of the community of 
believers.

even have been the original mappings in the evolution of humankind) and conquests or wars. For

The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms 
in Myth and Religion 
Aristotle distinguished “generatio” and “corruptio” in his physics. “generatio” is the 
equivalent of morphogenesis, the creation of forms, and “corruptio” is the contrary 
term, the degradation, the degeneration, the corruption of forms. In the following, this 
contrary process is applied to religious symbolic forms. This process has to consider 
different aspects of the semiotic triad constitutive for symbolic forms. 
5.8.1 
Processes of Degradation in the Semiotic Triad: Sign 
Object–Sign Form–Interpretant 
The sign-theoretical triad, according to Peirce, mentions sign form (called “represen-
tamen” by Peirce; the representing form)–sign object (the designated entity)–inter-
pretant (the thought, content, or inner image; see below).19 In the case of the religious 
sign, e.g., the concept of God, the sign object is God (or, in a polytheistic religion, 
a speciﬁc god or a family, a ﬁeld of gods). The forms of signs (“representamen” 
in Peirce’s terms) can be the name of the god, its descriptive elaboration through 
properties, the image of the god (as a pictorial representation, a sculpture, a text), or 
its presence in a ritual, e.g., represented by masks or an actor, or a musical or gestural 
staging of the god. The notion of interpretant in Peirce’s writings has many aspects. 
At the phenomenological level, in the world of the sign user, the semiotic process 
(semiosis) implies causes and forces. Suppose God is the entity (object) referred to 
by the sign form (representamen), e.g., the name of God, his phonetic, visual, or 
other representation. In that case, the dynamic interpretant of the sign, God, is the 
world God created and the believer in this world.20 God is primarily the creator of 
everything that exists. He is the germ from which the dichotomy of sign object and 
sign form (e.g., a word) unfolds. This aspect shows up in the beginning statement of 
the Gospel of John, verses 1 and 3: 
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. […] 
Through him all things were made; without him, nothing was made that has been made. 
However, this notion of God is highly abstract, and if it meets a philosophical or 
theological demand, it cannot satisfy the typical adherent of a religious creed. The
example, in their campaigns, marches and battles, their settlement in colonies, the Roman soldiers 
mapped the Roman Empire in their minds. 
19 “The sign or representamen, is something that stands to somebody for something in some respect 
or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign, 
or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the ﬁrst 
sign. The sign stands for something, its object.” (C.P. 2.227–9, cited in Bucher [4]: 99). Cf. for the 
classiﬁcation of signs, different deﬁnitions, and usages of the notions sign and interpretant Peirce 
[23]. In Chap. 7 (of this book) the notion of interpretant is speciﬁed beyond the proposals of Peirce. 
20 Cf. the different types of interpretant described in Sect. 7.8. 

5.8 The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms in Myth and Religion

believer prays to God and asks him for a favor. Although a classical dictum says: 
“God helps those who help themselves”, most believers who pray to God and attend 
religious services instead consider God and other transcendent entities to help them 
in the same fashion as parents and friends are asked for help. They should have a 
real-world effect in favor of the prayer. This effect corresponds to the dynamic level 
of the interpretant of the sign God.21 
In the Christian and Jewish Bible/Tanach, man is considered as the (reduced) 
picture of God, but God can destroy humankind, as in the case of the Flood, because 
it did not act as his representation in the world should. The parable about the prodigal 
son (Luke, 15. 11–32) tells us that the son misbehaves, but his father forgives him 
when he returns and repents his behavior. Thus, the picture may deviate from the 
object it represents, but these faults can be repaired. In this case, God acts like 
a human person and not as an abstract force at the universe’s origin. This Janus-
headed concept of God may be logically inconsistent, but believers accept such 
inconsistencies because God is not strictly subjected to human logic. 
The existential effect of a religious creed becomes obvious in religious conﬂicts. 
Suppose individuals’ speech, writing, or religious actions contradict a religious 
community’s norms and standards. In that case, they can be excluded, excommu-
nicated, or banned, which can mean starvation and death. In these cases, a causal 
impact exists between religious creed and human life. In the inquisition process of 
the Roman church, the heretic should change his mind and revoke his false belief. 
Eventually, if he does not, his soul must be saved. Even on the stake at Rome in 
1600, Giordano Bruno was shown the cross and asked to revoke his heretic teaching 
(cf. Wildgen [40]:156f). In traditional Islam, converting to another religion may be 
penalized by death. The death penalty for non-believers or the burning at the stake 
for heretics is interpreted as the visible effect of God’s force and, thus, proof of his 
existence. In standard cases, the Last Judgment would decide on the penalization of 
the believer. In the case mentioned above, everybody can experience the effect and 
be aware of the dynamic interpretant of God. For the non-believer, the effect results 
from the religious institution (e.g., the committee of the Inquisition and, in the case 
of Bruno, the ﬁnal decision by Pope Clemens VIII). 
The interpretant (in terms of Peirce, see above) is the lawful, systematic correlation 
of the two poles: the object (of the sign) and the form of the sign (representamen). This 
correlation may be stable for some time. Still, in the sequence of sign usages, either by 
the same individual or in social exchange, i.e., with variable users, who are naturally 
different in their acquaintance with semiotic regularities, it tends naturally toward 
destabilization. Therefore, the instability of the interpretant is a natural process. 
Different routes to instability can be distinguished. Given a sign form (representamen 
or representing form), e.g., the word God, Jesus, Mary in Christianism or Jupiter, 
Mars, Venus, etc., in Roman polytheism, the reference cannot be secured objectively, 
and for this reason, it can deviate progressively, lose its contours, and be generalized 
or specialized. This deformation can affect one term of the duality object versus sign
21 Probably originated in classical Greek drama, it is widely accepted and also found in the Quran 
(13:11). It was criticized in Christian denominations that put God’s grace to the fore.

form or both. Each singular usage of the sign accumulates aberrations and diverges 
from the starting point.22 Two cases must be distinguished: 
(a) 
Instability of the reference (object, e.g., the objects God, Jesus, Mary, Jupiter, 
Venus). 
(b) Instability of the sign form (linguistic, visual, haptic, e.g., the names, pictures, 
sculptures of God, Jesus, Mary, Jupiter, Venus). 
In the ﬁrst case, two directions are possible. First, God (and, in the same way, the 
other entities) are generalized. Thus, God may be generalized to the creator of the 
universe, a universal spirit, or simply to Nature (cf. Spinoza’s “Deus sive Natura”). 
The second direction consists of progressive speciﬁcations. God adopts more and 
more the form of a human agent, listens to the prayers, and answers to them or helps 
the believer. On the other hand, if the believer does not behave correctly or if his 
faith is insufﬁcient, God can neglect or even punish him. 
In the second case, the name or the visual representation can shift, become similar, 
or even identical with other names, visual representations linked to neighboring 
deities. In cultural contact, the name may become ambiguous, designating different 
deities. The lexical ﬁeld of religious entities gets blurred, traditional distinctions are 
abolished, or new distinctions are added. The history of religions tells many stories 
in this respect. The instability of sign forms leads to unpredictable references. 
Religious communities have developed strategies to prevent the instability of reli-
gious signs. One strategy consists in avoiding names of God, cf. the biblical name 
of God YHWH (Hebraic  )יהוהthat was never pronounced overtly, fearing misuse. 
Statues and pictures of God were also forbidden. This tendency led to iconoclastic 
controversies in Judaism, Christianism, and Islam.23 The other strategy consisted of 
a dogmatic regulation of all sign-based communications about religion. The canon of 
holy texts in the three “text-religions” follows this strategy. In parallel, religious insti-
tutions control all pictures, statues, and dramatic representations (if not forbidden). 
The permanent threat of instability in religious communication triggers a wealth of 
dogmatic and even legal measures and sanctions with the hope that a breakdown of 
religious meanings can be avoided. 
If the indexical/referential function and the reference to something existing and 
controllable cannot be effectively guaranteed, the creeping instability of religious 
semiosis cannot be prevented. Semiosis tends to become self-referential. A bulk of 
ﬁctitious signs ﬁlls the mind of believers. This instability is not speciﬁc to religion. In 
everyday discourse, literary cultures, and even scientiﬁc discourse, such destabiliza-
tion and loss of referential security are steady companions of human communication 
and thinking. Therefore, the instability of religious communication does not deval-
uate religion or argue for an atheistic or agnostic position. Nevertheless, it indicates
22 In Chap. 7, the general dynamics of stable and unstable semiotic circuits are elaborated in the 
context of a dynamic model of semiosis called Kepler semiotics. 
23 The topic of iconoclasm in major religions is treated in more detail in Wildgen ([44]: 104– 
124), chapter: “Word, Picture or Music. Iconoclasm and Communication about God” (chapter title 
translated from German). It shows that a rigorous iconoclasm is impossible, as it would abolish any 
communication, even thinking about God.

the limits of any discourse that misses a solid referential control, the objectivity of 
scientiﬁc semiosis. However, even under the rigid control of referential and semi-
otic objectivity, the risk of instability, degradations, and sliding into the direction of 
meaninglessness cannot be permanently avoided. 
5.8.2 
Attributes of God/Gods and the Instability of Constructs 
with Abstract Attributes and Universal Quantiﬁers 
For the sake of simplicity, take monotheism as the background. In this case, there are 
one sign object, God, and correspondent sign forms (representamen, representing 
forms) in different modalities: the name of God, e.g., JHWH in the Jewish tradition, 
or a picture of God-father or the Trinity in Christianism, and Allah in the prayers of 
the followers of the prophet Mohamed. The major attracting force is between God 
and the world. God has created the world, and (in speciﬁc theologies) he regularly and 
spontaneously interferes with the world.24 The second force is epistemic, i.e., humans 
participate in God’s knowledge of the world. God’s dynamic and epistemic/mental 
effects establish two gradients (of attraction) that link God to the world and the 
individual mind. Suppose only the ﬁrst gradient, i.e., God’s causing of the world, is 
in focus. In that case, the position of God may be reduced to that of a ﬁrst-mover 
(as in Aristotelean astrophysics) or to the identiﬁcation of God with Nature (as in 
Spinoza’s “Deus sive Natura”; God is nature). If God is mainly an epistemic/mental 
force that allows humans to know the world, we arrive at the mystic union with God 
in reﬂection and meditation. 
If God as a sign object is blended with its sign form, e.g., his name, picture, 
or sculpture, God can degenerate into a (wooden, golden) idol. It can be looked 
at and touched (even destroyed by followers of another religion). If the religion 
is transmitted via holy texts, the name of God may be conserved, but the content is 
changed if new attributes are added, and others are neglected. The history of religions, 
their conﬂicts, and interferences demonstrate the rich ﬁeld of diversiﬁcation and 
reduction, augmentation and subtraction, and explosion and implosion. 
The sign object (cf. Peirce’s term), the existent but transcendent God, may become 
an object constructed only in the imagination. It can be given a concrete form, e.g., an 
artifact of a craftsman who makes the wooden sculpture of the god or, in the biblical 
context, the “golden calf”. The believer no longer turns to the invisible God but to the 
idol he can look at and touch. If the priests use this shift to their advantage in the rite 
and the believers do not (want to) perceive the shift, a deception occurs because, as 
the biblical critics of the idols correctly tell us, the idol is a human artifact. It cannot 
satisfy the hopes of help and rescue (even immortality in the afterworld). Investing 
the idol with divine power in complicated rituals seems to be a clever trick in this 
context because wood, bronze, and gold remain material substances. This reasoning
24 In the history of philosophy, the “occasionalism” of Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715) has further 
developed this position. 

122
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
is rationally plausible. However, it presupposes that the sign object, in the case of 
religion God, actually exists. 
It can be pretty helpful to construct such a phantasm as an object of religious 
fervor since it can, for example, have a political and social effect. Such a positive 
effect can be seen, for example, in the fact that the community of Israelites is held 
together by faith in the God of Israel, despite the worst trials over the millennia. Since 
the scriptures, laws, and rituals are preserved as far as possible, the associated faith 
can be renewed again and again like a phoenix from the ashes. By reading the texts 
(again and again), an already lost faith can be revived. In Israel, even the biblical 
Hebrew was revived in Ivrit ( .)ירבעDespite the expulsion of Jews from Palestine 
by the Romans, the religious community survived. The Christians persecuted in the 
Roman Empire could even achieve a dominant position after the tolerance of the 
Christian faith by emperor Constantin. After all, due to the colonial expansion of 
Christian states, it became the most extensive international religious community. 
Islam united the Arab tribes and enabled them to build a vast empire under the star 
of Allah. 
One could deduce from this that the sign object, God, has always been an illusion. 
Consequently, at least in faith, there would be no truth, but faith would only have a 
good or bad effect, i.e., the end of religion would justify the means. Even from such a 
skeptical point of view, the problem of the stability of the religious attractor remains 
because, without an anchor in the real world, this stability remains unattainable.25 
As with magical practices, there is always the chance to uncover the tricks of the 
magicians, the priests, etc. In the sixteenth century, the alchemists were able to 
enrich themselves with their promise to extract gold from other metals. At some 
point, however, the deception became apparent; the gold-plated bars were mainly 
made of lead. The alchemist fell out of favor, and he might have spent the rest of 
his life in the dungeon. Publicly convicted impostors and fraudsters may be lynched, 
i.e., operating with fraudulent phantasms harbors real, not just imagined, dangers. 
Two signiﬁcant types of variation and instability concern the sign form (“repre-
sentamen” in terms of Peirce) and the sign object (the represented).
(a) 
Variation and instability of the sign form. The sign form can vary or change if 
the object is ﬁxed. The proper name seems to be the ideal of a rigid designator 
insofar as it designates an individual (if necessary, speciﬁed by further iden-
tiﬁcations).26 In the case of common nouns and verbs, e.g., those designating
25 In his novel “1984”, George Orwell describes the dispute of O’Brien, a member of the Inner 
Party, with the main person in the novel, Winston. Here is a short quote: “[Winston] ‘In the end 
they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you 
to pieces.’ ‘Do you see any evidence that this is happening? Or any reason why it should?’ ‘No, I 
believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe—I don’t know, some spirit, 
some principle—that you will never overcome.’ ‘Do you believe in God, Winston?’ ‘No,’ ‘Then, 
what is it this principle that will defeat us?’ ‘I don’t know. The spirit of Man” (Orwell [22]: 282). 
26 Nevertheless, in many communities, a person changes his/her name in typical transition zones 
of his/her biography, such as becoming an adult and getting married. A ritualized case concerns the 
transition of a monk or a nun; they choose a new name as soon as they enter the community of a 
monastery.

plants, animals, artifacts, movement, action, etc., one can observe a considerable 
variation of denominations in geographical space (i.e., in different dialects, soci-
olects).27 Scientiﬁc nomenclature tried to ﬁx these nouns to ease communication 
in botany, zoology, and medicine. Biologists like Carl von Linée (1707–1778) 
have imposed a standard language, i.e., Latin for the scientiﬁc terminology, and 
the Aristotelean hierarchical architecture of designations, following the oppo-
sition of class and subclass via a speciﬁc difference (“differentia speciﬁca”). 
However, natural languages rarely show this binary, hierarchical architecture. 
The meaning of common nouns has one (in some cases several) centers, the 
core meaning, and a continuous ﬁeld more or less near this center. At the rims 
of the semantic ﬁeld, rather vague transitions separate the different ﬁelds; the 
point of transition is often dependent on the context of use. Cf. Wildgen [35] 
for a catastrophe theoretical model of vagueness.
(b) Variation and instability of the sign object. In the case of concrete nouns, the sign 
object can, at least in the case of scientiﬁc classiﬁcation, be speciﬁed precisely, 
i.e., the scientist can control the reference in his use of scientiﬁc terms. Such 
control is usually not possible in natural languages. In the case of abstract nouns, 
this variability (at the limit of randomness) of reference to sign objects is even 
more dramatic. Central notions in religion and ethics make use of abstract nouns. 
For example, if God or a speciﬁc god in a polytheistic religion is described, 
abstract nouns appear with a superlative attribute (universal quantiﬁer “all”) 
added; cf. Table 5.2. 
The fact that every single abstract attribute refers to a vague ﬁeld of sign objects 
means that accumulating such attributes does not reduce the ﬁeld. On the contrary, 
the ﬁeld’s vagueness is increased instead, i.e., the outer border of the prototypical 
ﬁeld is enlarged, and the prototypes (the central area) can multiply in the case of 
polysemy. The ﬁeld has the most substantial gradient in the center and fades until it 
reaches the frontier line. The frontier is deﬁned linguistically by hedges, like quasi-
, pseudo-, almost, still, or by the contact with other semantic ﬁelds that impose a 
transition line. 
In the case of expressions like All- and Omni- (cf. Table 5.2), the semantic ﬁeld 
is expanded without limits. The conjunction of two simple semantic ﬁelds (without 
a quantiﬁer like All) already has the effect of conjoining the zones of vagueness
27 The almost random variation of concrete nouns throughout the world’s languages has motivated 
Saussure’s “arbitraire du signe”. 

124
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
(the corresponding gradients) and thus enlarging the ﬁeld.28 If quantiﬁers are added 
and if many quantiﬁed attributes are combined, the semantic ﬁeld proliferates and 
becomes extremely unspeciﬁc; in terms of information theory, it loses information. 
At the limit, it has information zero, i.e., nothing is said about the entity God.29 
As an example, take the qualiﬁcation of God as All-loving. The verb love has 
prototypical examples: the bride loves her bridegroom and the mother loves her 
child. These prototype attitudes are already different insofar as the ﬁrst may have 
sexual/erotic features, whereas the second does not. However, suppose someone loves 
everybody or even everything in the universe. In that case, the difference between 
the basic prototypes is blurred, and the content of love vanishes with the magnitude 
of the set of possible love objects.30 
If the semantic centers refer to different semantic ﬁelds, as in the list above, this 
disparity risks losing any contour or shape; it becomes amorphous. 
5.8.3 
Ritual Texts. The Meaning of Hymns or Psalms 
The semantic analysis above comes to a result that probably does not persuade 
believers. They will object that religious texts have a different way of signifying 
than everyday utterances. Their ritual character, the words’ sublimity, and poetic 
mood have a different goal than profane descriptions, statements, and arguments. 
Their content is characteristically transcendent, aiming at meaning and communica-
tion beyond profane affairs. In the context of sacred objects, buildings, and actions, 
signifying strives for meanings not easily grasped in everyday contexts. The signi-
ﬁcation may be compared to the music in a formal context, e.g., in a symphony 
by Beethoven or Bruckner in a concert hall. We can check this hypothesis for the 
case of hymns and psalms, typical (poetic) religious texts. A signiﬁcant effect of the 
hymn or psalm is the attitude described in the song by Josh Groban, an American 
singer–songwriter (born in 1981, multi-platinum pop artist): 
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains. 
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas. 
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders. 
You raise me up to more than I can be. 
As an example of religious (poetic) texts, I take Psalm 46 (King James Version).
28 Cf. for the problem of vagueness in semantics Ballmer and Pinkal [3] and Wildgen [35]. 
29 Prototype semantics is the natural model of meaning in the case of visual prototypes and can be 
evaluated via computational models; cf. Pino et al. [25]. 
30 Hannah Arendt analyzed the doctrine of love by the philosopher and Doctor of the Church 
Augustine in her doctoral thesis “Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustinus” (Arendt [1]). The love to God 
(not of God) is, for Augustine, the basis not only of human love but of any societal behavior cf. for 
a semiotic discussion of her argument Wildgen ([44]: 48–52, in German). 

5.8 The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms in Myth and Religion
125
God is our refuge and strength, 
a very present help in trouble. 
Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, 
though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea, 
though its waters roar and foam, 
though the mountains tremble at its swelling. 
The psalm lyrically presents an extreme danger, a catastrophe where the earth 
gives way, mountains are moved into the sea, waters swell, and mountains tremble. 
God is the only refuge and may help in this extreme and terrifying context. Such 
situations were probably never experienced by the believers who speak or sing this 
psalm. Still, the text signiﬁes for them the anguish and scare of a situation for which 
no one is prepared or can ﬁnd rational means to save his life. The believers imagine 
a situation where they are helpless and ask for divine help. 
The psalm and many traditional ritual texts transport the memory of terrible 
catastrophes, passed down by many generations and ﬁnally codiﬁed in the religious 
text. Their standard horizon is that of apocalyptic situations. The philosopher and 
theologian Paul Tillich distinguished two notions of time: Chronos, i.e., the everyday 
phenomenon of temporal sequence, and Kairos, a time which goes for its end, for a 
downfall, the doomsday when all rules are overthrown, the reign of God begins, and 
the ﬁnal judgment of all human actions is done. The realm of meanings and mean-
ingful utterances on behalf of this time differs from the everyday meanings humans 
are accustomed to. The standard “logic” of real life in the time “Chronos” is given 
up. It seems impossible to give an account of such irrational “semiotics” in scientiﬁc 
terms; Kepler’s semiotics is not helpful under these circumstances (cf. Chap. 7 for 
this notion). So the question arises if a poet’s semiotics, an aesthetic strategy, may 
help or if it adds just a new myth to older ones. 
5.8.4 
Personiﬁcation and Allegory as an Antidote 
to Semantic Instability in Religious Systems 
To avoid the adverse effects of the instability and variability of individual beliefs 
and the difﬁculties of an objective discourse about religion, the history of religions 
manifests speciﬁc solutions: The attributes deﬁning religious entities are projected on 
examples, ideal persons, life stories of prominent individuals, on visual or enacted 
ﬁgures, e.g., in a tragedy, a novel or a mystery play, a sculptural program. These 
real or imaginary persons stand for abstract attributes. To reach the corresponding 
virtue, the believers should follow these persons, identify with them, and imitate 
their doings or sayings. Thus, in Christianism, the believer, and more speciﬁcally 
the priest, monk/nun who wants to be a saint after death, has to adopt the behavior 
and, if possible, the appearance of Christ, Mary, or some saint he/she has chosen, 
e.g., the saint from whom his Christian name is derived. The believer in Islam should 
follow the behavior or sayings of Mohammed and be like Mohammed. In polytheistic

126
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
religions, the demigods, e.g., Heracles, Achilles, and many others, serve as ideal 
persons who should be imitated. The Roman emperors, e.g., Nero (37–68 AD), 
understood themselves as gods (but mortal), i.e., the transcendent entity has ﬂesh 
and concrete life and power. The problem of extreme vagueness or a loss of control 
over the sign object seems to be solved by this procedure. However, this solution is 
not apt to fulﬁll the hopes of believers in rescue and justice. 
Linguistically, one can observe a double semantic shift: First, by using a proper 
name, a denomination is rigidly attached to persons; the name even controls their 
destiny (“nomen est omen”). Second, a shift to description, i.e., the use of common 
nouns, adjectives, nominal phrases, and narratives. Common nouns and, more 
dramatically, abstract nouns open a world of variation and instability in the asso-
ciation of sign form and sign object. At the linguistic level, ambiguity and vagueness 
are increased in metaphors, multiple descriptions, and sentential constructions. This 
variability in the association of object/state of affairs and signs or sign complexes may 
be reduced by choosing exemplary persons as incarnations of virtues and attributes of 
divineness or sainthood (approaching the ideal features of God, Christ, Mohammed). 
The gospel (of Christ and his apostles), the collection of sayings (hadith) or actions 
(sunna) by Mohammed, and epical texts such as the Homeric poems, the Iliad, and 
the Odyssey introduce the personalities of God and their prophets, gods/goddesses, 
and demigods. They describe their appearance, their actions, and their character. 
The believers can choose the deities or ideal persons they prefer. Still, they must 
also consider the deities /ideal persons chosen by their enemies and prepare for a 
challenge that opposes human beings and the gods they have chosen. 
The problem of vagueness, instability, and variation is also relevant beyond reli-
gion, e.g., in profane ﬁelds that complement or replace religious value systems. An 
example is given by visual and sculptural programs on late Renaissance facades of 
town halls in Calvinist towns of the Netherlands and Northern Germany (cf. for 
the town hall of Bremen, Wildgen [41]: 274–281).31 The visual program contains 
a lexicon of public virtues (and vices) that have to be taken into account by their 
citizen and, more precisely, by leading citizens like the elected members of the 
municipal council. This topography of virtues and vices elaborates the religious 
code of Christian (especially Calvinist) communities in a political context. An alle-
gorical composition shows at the left the profane representation of power in the 
female allegorical ﬁgure representing the attribute majesty (lat. “maiestas”) holding 
the imperial “apple” and in the lion representing political dominance. They subdue 
the pope’s power with a tiara and sword, his pontiﬁcal cross sticking to his buttocks. 
The allegorical composition of the vice opulence shows a king on his throne holding 
down luxury, symbolized by a drunken and naked person. (cf. Wildgen [41]: 279 for 
analyzing the allegorical program of the late Renaissance town hall in Bremen).
31 A precursor of these allegorical programs in city halls may be the series of allegorical frescoes in 
the cityhall (Palazzo Publico) in Siena (Italy) designed by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (1285/1299–1348) 
in 1338/39: Allegories of Good and Bad Government; cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_All 
egory_of_Good_and_Bad_Government. 

5.8 The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms in Myth and Religion
127
Political governance is considered in republican constitutions as a system of 
ethical values parallel to or derived from the world of religion. This example shows 
that the problem of religious morphogenesis extends easily to social and political 
life. The consequences will be shown in Sect. 5.9. 
In the case of religious concepts, this means that the basic notions like God/gods, 
angels, heaven, or hell, which are construed by an array of attributes, become seman-
tically unstable, and the association of a sign to its object may become random. This 
instability has the effect that users can make up their idea of the associated object. 
Still, it also means that the association of the object cannot be controlled objectively. 
As a result, religious controversies cannot be solved discursively and may lead to 
violence, e.g., religious wars. 
5.8.5 
Truth in Religion, Religious Pluralism, and Historical 
Change 
Those religions that have survived the millennia attest to their stability, and one 
has to ask how this comes about. When we look at music, there may be no truth 
in music. Still, there is a kind of harmony between the needs and the possible 
perceptions of musical content, e.g., movement impulses, emotional content, and 
sometimes quasi-pictorial architectures (cf. Chap. 4 and Wildgen [44]: 116). It can 
remain open whether there is a quasi-object like the beauty or even the truth of 
music. The sign object “God” or other transcendent, supreme principles and values 
in Buddhism and Confucianism must meet speciﬁc quality criteria to be accepted 
and practically implemented by humans as a religious sign system. The problem 
thus shifts from the question of the truth of religion to its “truth-like”, consistent 
structure that is adequate for human thinking and imagining capacities. If religion 
aims to achieve long-term stability, it must be convincing or tolerable both for the 
ordinary believer, the addressee of the religion, and for the technological–scientiﬁc 
or the cultural–educational class to which theologians also belong. In the context 
of a rational, ultimately scientiﬁc discussion of religion, there should be a plausible 
system of assumptions and conclusions for the reﬂective person so that religion is 
acceptable, appealing, and stimulating. To a certain extent, religion is a “total work 
of art” accessible to everyone. It must therefore have aesthetic qualities. Besides, it 
has to be adaptable because people and the contexts of life change. Such an adap-
tion is excluded when religion is constructed as an ultimate truth. Rapid changes 
are dangerous for established religions, as the epidemic fragmentation of religious 
communities, especially in the post-Reformation era, shows. 
In contrast to the creeds coming up in the Reformation, the Catholic Church tried 
to freeze its dogmatic positions. It took almost four centuries to accept the Copernican

128

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
view of the universe32 and three centuries to adopt the liturgical innovations of Luther 
and other reformers (during the Second Vatican council, 1962–1965); the Darwinian 
view of the evolution of humans is still rejected in many American Christian denomi-
nations. In contrast to the conservatism of large religious communities, an adaptation 
to historical contexts can be seen as a chance for the survival of a religious commu-
nity since, from the variety of newly emerging forms of belief, a selection of faith 
better suited to the new forms of society can be made. Like most Western societies, 
post-secular societies demonstrate the coexistence of many creeds and agnostic and 
atheistic positions. The constitutional laws demand the acceptance of other creeds of 
their citizen, i.e., religious liberalism. This demand induces fundamental changes in 
the self-image of most established religions. Habermas (1981) interprets this process 
as the reduction of the traditional sacred, the numinous to everyday discourse open 
to challenge and compromise (cf. the discussion in Viertbauer [33], Chap. 5). 
Despite the variability of religious creeds and the forms of religious practices, 
there remains the necessity to link these symbolic forms to human experience, human 
needs, and vital values. Religion must be grasped with the means of the human mind 
(including feelings and will) and ﬁnd its place in concrete, spatially realized practices. 
Religion needs a “fundamentum in re”, an indexical rooting in reality. The problem 
of an ontological rooting of religious beliefs is central (cf. for questions of ontology 
Chap. 7). 
5.8.6 
Mythical “Bricolage” and Ratiogenetic Construction 
of Religious Systems 
Although knowledge-based processes are a relevant part of religious systems, these 
are not primarily knowledge systems but have to respond to other needs and condi-
tions of global success and stability. For a human-relevant religion, at least two 
aspects are crucial: 
1. The doctrine of the faith must also satisfy complex needs, not just offer stopgaps 
in case of panic. It should exercise a positive, peaceful function that ﬁlls the 
whole psychic ﬁeld of the individual. This achievement can be afﬁrmed despite 
all the misalignments in the historically grown religions. 
2. The doctrine of the faith must, especially in large, structured, and conﬂict-ridden 
societies, contribute to a non-violent coexistence that can use people’s capacity 
to solve problems. This feature requires constant adaptation of the belief bases, 
at least when implemented in everyday practice. Given the rapid pace of change 
in the globalized world, this is a tough challenge for religions because they 
must maintain a credible continuity (what was true yesterday should not be 
wrong tomorrow) and still react creatively to change. Therefore, a delay tactic
32 Luther also rejected the theory of Copernicus, but Rheticus was sent by Melanchthon, the theo-
logical partner of Luther, to Poland and could persuade Copernicus to have his manuscript printed 
(in Nürnberg 1543). 

5.8 The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms in Myth and Religion
129
is probably appropriate because some temporary challenges may become redun-
dant with the following historical change of context. Most established religious 
communities follow the strategy: stability ﬁrst, adaptation only if unavoidable. 
Religious systems are very complex organizations and may be compared to an 
opera by Richard Wagner, where musical, literary, visual/architectonic, and dramatic 
innovations contribute to a balanced and overwhelming effect. In the history of ﬁlm, 
one can also notice developments where, beyond the moving pictures, new forms of 
music designed for the ﬁfth art are devised, and new techniques of quasi-literary story-
telling are invented. This progress means that textual, visual, and musical symbolic 
forms must be coordinated into a coherent and persuading complex.33 Of course, the 
individual spectators, or believers in the case of religion, do not necessarily capture all 
this complexity. They instead select particular features. Still, the holistic impression 
of plenitude/opulence persuades them that their belief is part of a global, extremely 
relevant, and even exhaustive system they can share with a large community. 
The dynamics of religious communities are beyond the fulﬁllment of individual 
needs, ruled by rather global gradients and ﬂows that are, in many cases, inaccessible 
to human awareness. Here are a few of them: 
(a) 
During the historical development of religions and their communities, there is a 
constant ﬂow of augmentation and innovation on one side and loss or reduction 
on the other. We may call these gradients: (positive) accumulation and (negative) 
reduction. In general, the religious system, like other global systems of infor-
mation and values, prefers accumulation to reduction, i.e., it is harder to reduce 
or simplify the system than to accept augmentation and addition. In the long 
run, this results in hyper-complexity, a loss of coherence, and increased contra-
dictions. Moreover, transferring such a hyper-complex system from generation 
to generation becomes difﬁcult and risky. In a non-literary society that lacks 
a class of priests, teachers, and administrators, a system that is too complex 
will naturally collapse and be abandoned. On the other hand, highly organized 
and wealthy societies may afford hyper-complex religions or other complicated 
systems of rules and laws. In the case of political and social conﬂict or war 
with neighboring societies, the burden of hyper-complexity is brought down, 
a reduction is enforced, or the whole system is abandoned in favor of another 
religion, e.g., the one imported by a winning neighboring society or culture. In 
other cases, the losers of the conﬂict accept the rules of the winner, but they 
reduce the foreign system of beliefs to its basic schemes. Thus, in the Chris-
tianization of Germanic populations, many belief systems, ethical standards, or 
technics of medicine and everyday habits were conserved alongside a rather 
superﬁcial adoption of the Christian faith. Similar processes occurred in the 
Islamic expansion to North Africa, Spain, and India/Indonesia. 
(b) A second gradient concerns the geographical and social distribution of religious 
systems. The underlying space has three dimensions; two dimensions are given 
by geographical space, i.e., the surface of a country, its distances, and directions.
33 Cf. the analysis of ﬁlm music in Wildgen ([42]: 107–112). 

130
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
A third dimension is social stratiﬁcation (in the simplest case, high to low). Reli-
gious and other value-based systems (political, economic) result in the recursive 
tiling of the plane or the three-dimensional socio-geographic space. The problem 
of regular tilings or tessellations in space was already a topic in Greek math-
ematics in antiquity, i.e., the regular tiling of a plane by polygonal shapes like 
regular triangles, squares, hexagons, etc. Bruno, Kepler, Leibniz, and Jungius 
have discussed (before and after 1600) the tiling of the plane with smaller and 
smaller circles (and of space with spheres).34 This problem ﬁnally led to the 
consideration of inﬁnitesimals in the work of Leibniz and Newton. Penrose 
([24]: 168–181) discussed non-recursive tilings, which preﬁgure the problem 
of fractals and modern complexity theory. In chemistry, tilings are manifesta-
tions of diffusion patterns; cf. “Voronoi”-patterns. In the case of religion, the 
expansion patterns are comparable to a chemical reaction with diffusion and 
obstacles (such as natural forces like mountains or rivers, lakes or seas). 
(c) 
Moreover, an area may be already occupied, which means conﬂict, replace-
ment/displacement, or superimposition and interference. If we neglect superim-
position, space can be fragmented regularly without lacunas, like an agricultural 
surface subdivided into ﬁelds or claims. After the Christianization of Europe, 
North Africa, and the near East in late antiquity and early Middle-Age, or after 
the progress of Islam, from 632 A.D. to 750 A.D., the geographical space was 
reshaped in terms of religion. Islami expansion deﬁned new frontiers in Egypt, 
the Maghreb area, Spain, and Northern India, later in the former Byzantine reign, 
Greece, and the Balkans. Some areas, like Palestine, changed hands between 
Judaism, Christianism, and Islam and again to Judaism with the foundation of 
Israel. In all these changes, minorities conserved the former religion, which was 
tolerated by the majority or led to conﬂict and war. In feudal Europe until the 
French Revolution, the populations living under the reign of a sovereign had 
to adopt the sovereign’s religion. This principle was called “Cuius regio eius 
religio” (whose reign (determines) the corresponding religion). 
The conquests of Napoleon replaced religion with the creed of the revolutionary 
spirit and a republican constitution. It abolished the dominance of religion over 
profane governance and established a secularist regime. In Germany, Jews became 
regular citizens and could leave their ghettos. Such geographical and social dynamics 
can also change the political orientation of the religions involved. The Lutherans 
and other reform creeds replaced the authority of the Pope with obedience to their 
sovereign. In contrast, the Catholic Church tried to uphold speciﬁc rights of the church 
concerning the sovereign. Thus, pope Pius XI signed the “Treaty of the Vatican” with 
Mussolini in 1929, and his follower Pius XII, 1933 still Cardinal Secretary of State 
Eugenio Pacelli, signed a corresponding concordat (“Reichskonkordat”) in August 
1933 with the German government (vice-chancellor von Papen). This strategy of 
soft adaptation to governmental power was called “Aggiornamento” (adapting to 
the day) and was also pursued as a political device in the Second Vatican Council 
(1962–1965). With this gradient, principles shared in the states where Catholics live,
34 Cf. The analysis of Giordano Bruno’s geometrical constructions in Wildgen ([38]: 87–102). 

5.8 The Instability and Degradation of Symbolic Forms in Myth and Religion
131
like democracy, the acceptance of constitutions and state laws, and free choice of 
religion were recognized. 
Moreover, the dialogue with other religions existent in the same territory (mainly 
protestant, orthodox Christians, Islamic populations, and Jews) was tolerated. The 
geographical distribution of religions is beyond political processes correlated with 
the distribution of other value systems, some older than religious creeds. Thus, 
archaic family systems inﬂuence the preference not only of speciﬁc religions but 
also of ideological and political systems, e.g., political parties representing a reli-
gious faith or a political ideology, for instance, a socialist/communist party or a 
conservative/Christian one.35 
In his anthropology of myths, Claude Lévi-Strauss tried to ﬁnd the underlying 
“logic” and even a mathematical formula for myths (cf. Wildgen [43] and [44]: 
225–234). In the context of his anthropology, he introduced the term “bricolage” 
(handicraft work) regarding religious and other value systems. “Bricolage” captures 
mythical beliefs, partially ordered or given by chance. They often show a patchwork 
combining insights and speciﬁcations at different times by different subpopulations 
or neighboring cultures. This strategy is also characteristic of many religions. In 
antiquity, the polytheistic systems dominant in Egypt, Greece, India, and the Roman 
Empire could absorb almost all religions encountered during political and military 
expansion. They could always add a new god to the pantheon, mostly in subaltern 
places. The adherents to the new god could build their temple and practice their 
rituals.36 
Religious innovators like the pharaoh Akhenaten (ca. 1300 BC) reduced the rich 
pantheon of Egyptian gods to one god Aten (the sun). After his death, the polytheistic 
system was, however, restored. The religion of Moses was also monotheistic in 
opposition to the contemporary polytheism of Egypt. It was, however, limited to a 
speciﬁc population, the Jewish tribes, in search of the Holy Land (Palestine), and thus 
had to acknowledge the existence of other gods in neighboring cultures. In antique 
India of the ﬁfth century BC, Buddha tried to eliminate all false ideas of religion 
and eventually arrived at the depersonalized view of “nirvana”, i.e., gods and all 
other entities like heaven, or hell was left apart (“deconstructed” in modern terms). 
Monotheistic religions like Judaism and Christianism were opposed to the additive 
strategy of polytheistic religions. Under the Roman emperor Cesar, Jews could obtain 
a degree of tolerance. Still, Christians were persecuted under the emperor Nero and 
had to organize in secret places (e.g., meet in the catacombs of Rome). The religious 
innovators, Christ and Mohammed, puriﬁed the complexities of the temple religion 
in Jerusalem (Christ) and the polytheistic creeds of Arabic tribes around Mecca and 
Medina.
35 Cf. the publications by Emmanuel Todd, in English: Todd and Garrioch [32]. 
36 There existed even a worship for the unknown god in Athens and the apostle Paul referred to 
it in his speech at the Aeropagus in Athens: “as I passed along, and observed the objects of your 
worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD’” (Gospel, Acts, 
17: 23). I thank Wolfgang Fritz for this information. 

132
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
However, these reductions were not the ﬁnal word. Buddhist creed began to adopt 
elements of the Hindu pantheon in India; Buddha was represented in statues like a 
god. In Christianism, Jesus Christ was considered not only the messiah but as God 
himself at the side of his God-father. Eventually, Augustine created the trinity of 
God-Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. From a rhetorical perspective, such a trinity 
was considered a kind of unity, such that the monotheistic quality of Christianism 
could be preserved. Moreover, with the accumulation of Saints during two millennia 
of Christianism, an extensive list of holy personalities was created, which were “lifted 
to the altar”, such that praying men/women could address them and ask for advice 
and help. 
Many critical persons inside Catholicism (e.g., Giordano Bruno) rejected the 
accumulation of saints and their pictures in the religious practice of believers. The 
reformers, Luther and Calvin, and others suppressed this worship. It seems that all 
religions practiced by a large population have both tendencies: First, expand the list 
of objects (persons) of worship, adding pictures, statues, and other material signs. 
Second, reduce this richness or even ban all pictures and sculptures and limit the 
objects of worship to only one (or none in original Buddhism). 
Lévi-Strauss, in his analysis of South American myths, compared the under-
lying technology to “bricolage”, or patchwork in handicrafts, collage in visual art, 
and gives a negative account of this activity. On the contrary, it can be argued that 
religions perform a relevant cultural task. They select among existing ethics and 
social values, diverse forms of life (“Lebensform”; cf. Wittgenstein [46], and histor-
ical achievements (positive or negative). Eventually, they establish a basic set of 
elements that could direct the future of a group, a society, or humankind. This set 
is naturally incoherent and possibly contains contradictions and antinomies. The 
cultural task is, therefore, to ﬁnd a stable construction that can embed all these 
selected elements. The architecture of a timber-framed farmhouse may serve as a 
metaphor for religion. Two different materials, timber and bricks, are characteristic. 
The timber frame deﬁnes the skeleton of the house and its statics. The bricks that ﬁll 
the lacunas protect the house against wind, frost, rain, and intruders. Additionally, 
the grounding may consist of ﬁeld stones; the roof may be covered with thatch or 
reed. In the case of Christianism, at least three different constituents dominate the 
theological construction: A very general command of charity contained in all major 
religions, perhaps with a speciﬁc proﬁle and force in the words of Christ (not so much 
in the deeds of Christian churches); the Messianic ideal and the doctrine to be the 
people chosen by God (inherited from Judaism); eventually the knowhow of gover-
nance taught by the administration of the Roman Empire (adapted after the tolerance 
edict of Constantine). The last ingredient helped the Christian arch-priests in Rome 
and Constantinople (Byzantium) to build and consolidate the political constructions 
in Western and Eastern Europe (the self-proclaimed new Roman Empires, e.g., of 
Charlemagne or the “Holy Roman Empire of the German nation “ until 1806). Similar 
constructions involving basic ethic values, historical and ethnic identities, and polit-
ical or historical “grafting” are characteristic of all large religious communities that 
have survived for millennia.

5.9 Post-Religious Ethics and Political Myth
133
5.9 
Post-Religious Ethics and Political Myth 
This section is motivated by the last writing of Ernst Cassirer, “The Myth of the 
State”, and his remarks on ethics (cf. Jagersma [18]). Ethics and practical reason are 
a foundation level of culture for Cassirer, and all symbolic forms contribute to or are 
manifestations of ethical principles. In its foundational role, ethics are comparable 
to myth and religion, and Cassirer considers ethics to be the starting level for both 
the symbolic forms of language (art) and science. The following section deals with 
some aspects of ethics and political myth in the spirit of Cassirer. 
5.9.1 
Protagoras Ethics and the Semiogenesis of Xenophobia 
The human body is one model according to which people can shape the image of 
God. If racist demarcations shape the image of the body, religious terms and ideas 
may also become racist. The background of this connection is the basic corporeality 
of the reference system, i.e., one’s own body is the starting point (zero point) in 
the construction of the system of symbolic forms (of language, images, music, and 
myth). The sentence of the ancient sophist Protagoras “Homo mensura”, i.e., “man is 
the measure of all things”, applies at least to the contents of the symbolic forms. The 
general concepts of the world and God are thus relative to individual conscience or 
the group’s self-perception. Suppose this is closed or self-contained, like the group 
of Israelite patriarchs, the Pilgrim Fathers in New England, and the Puritan settlers 
in Virginia. In that case, moral ideals, legal concepts, and religious rules are also 
limited by this worldview. Socrates and Plato rebelled against such a limitation, as 
did Kant later in his Ethics. From their point of view, man as a species is the measure 
of all things and, beyond that, nature, of which man is only a part. 
The criticism of “Protagoras’ ethics” also comes from systems theory. “Synerget-
ics”, the science of coordinating subsystems that achieve global stability and high 
performance (according to Haken [14]), examines the interaction of many subsys-
tems that limits their dynamics and thus enables controllable, stable dynamics of 
the overall system. Models are physical systems such as the laser or chemical, and 
biological systems such as stable reaction/diffusion patterns and regular organiza-
tion in plants and animals. Such systems are called complex because they assemble 
diverse, often divergent systems into one overarching “complex system”. This feature 
can signiﬁcantly increase the overall system’s effectiveness but also implies a lack 
of freedom and an increase of coercion for the subsystems that are integrated into 
the “synergetic” totality. The group, the clan, the subculture, and the society impose 
rules of behavior, correct living, and adjusted opinions on individuals or sub-groups. 
The free motivations and judgments of individuals are regulated or even suppressed. 
The systems theorist Christoph von der Malsburg describes the willingness to accept 
such paternalism as a “group instinct”. The result is usually a hatred of outsiders 
and a willingness to use violence against strangers. According to von Malsburg,

134
5
The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
this tendency of humans and human societies is a fundamental biological attitude of 
humans, which probably has deep evolutionary roots. 
Group violence is an instability of human society that threatens to strike just anywhere. The 
neurobiological basis for it is what I call here our group instinct. This instinct is essential as 
social glue to let us collaborate harmoniously inside our group. However, it does not extend 
to members of other groups against whom we can be incited to commit arbitrary acts of 
violence. It is important to raise worldwide consciousness that this instinct is in all of us and 
that in this sense we are all time bombs. The original structure of the instinct is directed at 
the social environment we experience directly, but is lifted to large scale by social constructs 
such as nation, race, class, or religion. These social constructs rest on the misconception that 
the individual mind is capable of detailed understanding of society as a whole. Overcoming 
this misconception will rob large-scale group violence of its breeding ground. (Malsburg 
[21]: 37f) 
Christoph von der Malsburg sees a dysfunctional tendency in religions and other 
overarching cultural constructs. In globalization, archaic principles (“instincts” in his 
biological perspective) are no longer helpful and have become a danger threatening 
people and their societies. From this, he derives a critique of religion and other 
collective constructs. They transport an authoritarian tendency that suppresses the 
freedom of the individual and thus their creativity. He summarizes: 
It is true that in our society another worldview is still alive, although rarely given clear 
expression. According to it, I as an individual see myself as part of an organism, which 
has its own higher goals and reasons, which is high above me and which I cannot hope to 
understand. My role in life is to struggle and ﬁnd my place in this world, to conform to what 
is asked of me, to do my duty, and to ﬁnd fulﬁllment in being part of that higher organism. 
We hear such words spoken in church, but it is sadly true that religion itself to a very large 
extent is maimed by the Protagorean worldview, formulating apodictic truths to be forced on 
others […], picturing a personal god in the image of the individual, a god who is responsible 
for the creation, who is to be argued with in terms of utilitarian values, and who is misused 
to deﬁne groups and incite violence against non-believers. (Malsburg [21]: 35) 
The social instinct is initially limited to the social environment but is later extrap-
olated to the global world, quickly leading to intractable conﬂicts. This scenario 
is reminiscent of Hobbes’ hypothesis that man is more like a wolf (“homo homini 
lupus”). A strict social order (preferably a monarchy in his view at the time of Hobbes) 
was intended to counter this natural trend. In contrast to von Malsburg’s argument, 
Hobbes considers constructs such as nation or monarchy necessary and beneﬁcial. 
Opposed to the “group instinct” and Protagoras ethic, there is the phenomenon of 
altruism, which can be found in all human societies. It arose probably from caring 
for offspring, mutual help, and the social distribution of food.37 It plays a central 
role in most religions; see the “love of one’s next” in Christianism. Religion seeks a 
balance between these contrary tendencies.
37 In this context, the mass of contributions to “altruism” cannot be discussed. However, a scale 
of choices in the organization of living beings between the egoism of solitary individuals and the 
altruism of those living in family groups, herds, etc., is a plausible assumption. The species Homo 
sapiens is in a middle position on this scale. This means that the behavior of individuals in this 
species is ambivalent or unpredictable. Therefore, any social system and even more religion must 
consider both tendencies and search for a stable compromise. 

5.9 Post-Religious Ethics and Political Myth
135
There have been, and there are, many totalitarian forms of state and govern-
ment, i.e., forms of governments that do not grant the citizens any rights but oppress 
them with brutal force. In the following, the forms that occurred in Europe are 
analyzed, especially after the First World War, using the example of the Nazi regime 
in Germany. Comparable is the totalitarian regime in Italy by Mussolini (from 1922 
to 1943), in Russia by Stalin (from 1922 to 1953), Portugal by Salazar (from 1930 
to 1974), and in Spain by Franco (from 1939 to 1975) and similar regimes in Asia 
and South America. These global forms (one could even call them symbolic forms 
as they are supported by propaganda in words and pictures) have arisen in the near 
past, and their morphogenetic analysis is more accessible than the reconstruction of 
the genesis of traditional religions, whose initial phase happened thousands of years 
ago. 
From a religious point of view, what is new with these global political forms is, 
ﬁrst of all, the radical negation of traditional Christian and humanistic values and 
norms. In Italy and Spain, the catholic church was tamed or subordinated to the 
fascist state; after an episode of confrontation, Mussolini achieved “Conciliazione” 
with the Pope; in Spain, the catholic authorities continued their traditional support 
for the monarchic state by accepting the general Franco is a temporary substitute; 
in Japan, the quasi-religious leader, the emperor retained his political and religious 
functions. The Nazi regime of Hitler and the communism of Stalin tried to abolish 
the role of Christian churches and replace it with racist or atheist ideologies. On the 
one hand, religions such as Judaism and Christianism are persecuted or suppressed; 
on the other hand, an attempt is made to create a short-lived synthesis from given 
pieces of political, philosophical, religious, historical, and biological discourses of 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.38 If in their beginnings, these political 
movements demonstrated features of morphogenesis and self-organization, i.e., the 
reduction of the set of political alternatives in favor of radical choices, they became 
in further development dependent on other strong forces, for instance, military logic, 
economic pressures, and the proliferation of brutality and murder in a situation of war. 
As a result, the ideological (religious) components were weakened if not abolished. 
5.9.2 
The Political Myth as a Fraudulent Construction: 
Rosenberg’s “Mythus” 
At the end of the Second World War (and of his life), Ernst Cassirer wrote the book 
“The Myth of the State”, describing the misuse of myth and mythical concepts in 
political conﬂict, speciﬁcally targeted at the Nazi regime in Germany. Rosenberg’s 
book “The Myth of the 20th Century. An evaluation of the mental and spiritual
38 Leninism and later Stalinism had an intellectually better basis in Marxism, which at least was 
near to the state of the art of economic and political science in the second half of the nineteenth 
century. However, Stalinism was quickly overwhelmed by nationalistic and imperialistic contents 
and opened for anti-semitic propaganda. 

136

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
creative powers of our time” may represent this myth. Rosenberg, one of the earliest 
followers of Hitler and his chief ideologist, tried to put the rather impressionist ideas 
of Hitler and his entourage into a more or less consistent text form. Everything 
that has a name in intellectual history is related to the new ideal, the Nordic–Aryan 
race: from Achilles to Alexander, Aristophanes, Aristotle, Aeschylus, Augustine 
to Zarathustra, and Zwingli. Suppose one examines the respective characterization 
of the individual persons. In that case, one notices that they are strictly classiﬁed 
according to the given scheme: Nordic–Germanic–Aryan (good) versus Oriental– 
Near Eastern–Syrian–Jewish (bad). Rosenberg’s “Mythus” tries constructing a new 
lexicon of politically relevant concepts. A network of evaluation standards is brutally 
reduced and violently compressed into very few, if possible bipolar, attractors. In this 
black-and-white way of thinking, the fanatic supporter and the opportunist are offered 
a mechanism of judgment that can lead to a mass consensus. These dynamics are 
illustrated in the bipolar attractor landscape in Fig. 5.6. Mathematically, the bipolar 
situation appears in the unfolding of the elementary catastrophe called cusp (with 
the unstable germ: V = x4). 
Many properties and images are assigned to these two poles. Table 5.3 cites 
passages from Rosenberg’s book. The quotations are divided into two sections: 
External appearance—world view/religion/politics. First, the original statements in 
German are cited, then (after //) a translation (by the author) is given.
The racial theories had already been enriched with biological analogies at the end 
of the eighteenth century. The biblical monogenesis theory (Adam and Eve) was 
replaced with polygenesis theories (origin of genetically different types of people) 
and models of degeneration (the white race as a pure race). In the second half of the 
nineteenth century, misinterpretations of Darwin (social Darwinism) gave a “scien-
tiﬁc” or modernist touch to traditional antisemitism. In this way, under the guise of

The political relevance of the myth constructed by Rosenberg remains doubtful. 
As Hitler’s biography (see Simms [27]) shows, he was a semi-educated, self-taught 
hate preacher obsessed with very few practical goals. Worldview and philosophical 
or religious considerations were beyond the intellectual possibilities of Hitler and his 
prominent companions and therefore played no decisive role in practical decisions.

The Morphogenesis and Self-Organization of Myth and Religion
5.10 
Summary and Conclusion 
The morphogenetic paradigm in religious science allows an analysis of the belief 
systems, their internal coherence, and the gradients of change. It can also help 
to describe the geometry of diffusion, conﬂict, and the superposition of religious 
traditions. It furnishes the conceptual and mathematical tools able to describe the 
stability/instability and the change of religions. The tools of dynamical systems 
theory can be applied in a qualitative fashion, which allows for the integration of 
traditional analyses in a descriptive or hermeneutic style. In this sense, the qual-
itative models proposed on the background of dynamic system theory fulﬁll the 
function of a meta-analysis of existing theories of religion and their history. Given 
the natural science access to the phenomenon of “religion”, such an interpretative, 
qualitative access may seem insufﬁcient. Qualitative analysis can, however, prepare 
and specify scientiﬁc hypotheses that are evaluated using current observations and 
historical facts. Religious processes are often embedded in long-term processes and 
thus inaccessible to experiments or observations in empirical ﬁeld studies.

Chapter 6 
The Morphogenesis of Language 
and Morphodynamic Grammar 
Abstract Language is the most prominent symbolic form and has been the focus 
of classical philosophy and semiotics. This book has placed the main focus on three 
symbolic forms, music, art, and myth/religion, because embodiment and morphogen-
esis are better expressed via these forms. The current chapter will complete the picture 
and view language from the same perspective as music, art, and myth/religion. The 
ﬁrst section discusses an array of predispositions for the morphogenesis of human 
language, a possible intermediate step called protolanguage, and the route toward 
historically documented languages. The following chapters sketch a morphogenetic 
view of the grammar of human language with an emphasis on the lexicon and syntax. 
In this part, the author’s research on René Thom’s proposals for topological grammar 
is summarized, actualized, and elaborated. 
6.1 
Biological Predispositions for the Morphogenesis 
of Human Language 
In the ﬁrst section, conditions for the morphogenesis of human language capacity 
are discussed, and the fundamental bifurcations in the evolution of the language 
capacity common to our species (Homo sapiens) are speciﬁed.1 Preadaptations 
for language are evolutionary and morphogenetic processes not directly leading to 
human language. Instead, they are selected for locomotion advantages, the correct 
detection and categorization of objects and events in the environment, and the stability 
and the further evolution of social relations (for instance, progeniture, child care, and 
social cohesion). In the evolution of human language, these factors continue to be 
relevant and eventually co-evolve with language capacity.

after 2004 are summarized in Fitch [25], Dor et al. [20]. The author has also treated some questions 
concerning the evolution of language after 2004 in Wildgen [77–81] and Wildgen [79]).

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
In evolutionary biology, the phenomenon of predisposition or pre-adaptation is 
known in various species. Cognitive evolution (e.g., of the brain and the sensory 
organs) probably had a speciﬁc advantage in the sensory and motor ﬁeld. The 
increased imitative faculties and memory enhanced learning and the establishment 
of rituals and culture. Walking upright and transforming the forehead and the mouth 
produced the typical phonetic apparatus of man between the vocal cords and the lips. 
As language capacity involves motor, sensory, and neural abilities, all three domains 
must be investigated in terms of pre-adaptation. The development of the larynx is 
possibly the most speciﬁc predisposition. 
We distinguish three phases: the predispositions for the morphogenesis of human 
language, an assumed intermediate stage called protolanguage, and the human 
language capacity that was decisive for the constitution of the species Homo sapiens. 
6.1.1 
Motor Programs as Predispositions 
for the Morphogenesis of Language at an Early Stage 
The motor patterns of chewing and breathing could have been sophisticated to 
develop motor patterns of vocalization. The development of mirror neurons enabling 
quick learning (copying) of motor patterns from other individuals of the same species 
would have allowed the quick adaptation to traditions or rituals of vocalization 
(languages).2 Possibly a gestured language preceded the syntactic organization and 
ﬁne motor skills of vocalization and articulation. As soon as the muscular control of 
hand movements was achieved and learning capacities were increased, partial and 
ritualized hand movements could support semiolinguistic activities on a gestured 
basis.3 Corballis [18] suggests a sequence of evolutionary steps based on the function 
of mirror cells in the human lineage. He assumes the following steps: 
1. Grasping of objects (non-human primates). 
2. Facial gestures. 
3. Manual gestures (in the miming of events). 
4. Conventionalization of gestures (Homo erectus 2 my BP). 
5. Phonic language and the capacity of episodic memory. 
6. Mental time travel: Who did What to Whom, Where, and Why? 
Evolutionary steps corresponding to (1) and (4) to (6) will be the focus of morpho-
genetic grammar in later sections of this chapter. The difﬁculties of such a sequence
2 Lewis [44] reports that Ba Yaka pygmies, hunter-gatherer societies in Central Africa, imitate not 
only other members of the group but also animal sounds, nature sounds and the sounds of foreigners. 
Similar conditions probably prevailed in hominin species that lived in forests or at the rim of forests. 
3 Condillac had already considered the hypothesis of a gestural origin of language in the eighteenth 
century. The plausibility of this hypothesis stems from the parallelism between the gestural commu-
nication of deaf-mute persons and the vocal communication of humans without such disabilities. In 
the twentieth century, Allott [1–3] advocated such a model. The cognitive parallelism of gestures 
and language was also prominent for McNeill [45].

of scenarios are that transferring motor capacities to language would have created a 
conﬂict in using resources (muscular, respiratory, and cerebral). As cerebral resources 
are very costly, such a transfer is only possible if it “pays”. Therefore, one needs a 
causal/dynamic explanation in which social demands for these changes or other func-
tions involving the survival context or social dynamics are empirically proven (there 
should exist an immediate payoff). As an alternative or in addition, one can draw on 
the dynamics of self-organization, enforcement, and rapid selection (cf. hypercycles 
in the sense of Eigen and Schuster [22]) and others. Evolutionary psychology has 
followed the ﬁrst route but remained inconclusive because the payoff is only plau-
sible for specialized, technical contexts, even in current language use. The following 
sections investigate the second route because it ﬁts into the frame of morphogenesis. 
The auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile senses and motor schemata are neces-
sary for creating stable object concepts and the construction of relations between 
these. They allow the evolution of a stable semantic framework in natural languages. 
Gibson ([26]: 46 f.) says: 
Similarly the ability to construct an object image from varied properties is absent among 
reptiles but present among most mammals. All monkeys and apes construct visual object 
concepts. Only the most intelligent primates, however, (Cebus monkeys, some baboons and 
macaques, and all great apes) construct and manipulate relationships between two or more 
objects. (...) Only humans, for instance, use tools to make tools or construct tools from 
multiple raw materials and then apply these tools in a second goal-directed object–object 
manipulation. Humans also by far exceed other primates in their ability to construct objects 
hierarchically.” 
The capacity of relational thinking enables complex strategies in the search for 
food (memory for places, categories of food, time of ripeness, and value for different 
purposes). It is helpful for the preparation of food (cutting, grinding, cooking) and 
improves the faculty of collective hunting. Social relations may be better controlled, 
coalitions and power positions independent from actual force can be managed, and 
intrigues, strategies, and politics can be devised. Language may have become a 
primary faculty in the context of this increase in instrumental and social intelli-
gence. The behavioral and social consequences of such a cognitive evolution created 
the conditions under which linguistic competencies “paid”, i.e., they triggered a 
Darwinian scenario that selected individuals or groups based on linguistic skills. In 
such a scenario, the (latent) language capacity could have made decisive steps at the 
time of Homo erectus (ca. 2 million years BP = before the present), allowing the 
migration of this species to Eurasia. 
The growth of the brain is a general survival strategy and represents a trend in the 
evolution of mammals from basic insectivores upwards. The ﬁrst massive pressure 
toward bigger brains occurred during the transition to active daylight hunting in 
the trees. The major transition occurred when early hominids adapted to life in the 
Savannah (or the borders of forests) by walking upright and hunting as groups. The 
cortex and, at a different rate, the brain stem grew most quickly. The temporal lobe 
and later the frontal lobe increased speciﬁcally in the cortex. Linked to the temporal 
lobes and their growth, the asymmetry between the hemispheres also increased. This

feature was not “new” for humans but involved a quantitative change, which may 
have triggered qualitative and functional changes. 
A larger brain involves a set of preconditions and consequences. First, brain size 
depends mainly on in-utero growth in contrast to the growth of bones and, thus, 
overall body size, which depends on nutritional and environmental conditions after 
birth. Second, in-utero growth is controlled by the energy supply available to the 
mother, e.g., the quality of her food. Therefore, a change in hominid diet was the 
primary precondition for an increased brain. Third, the individual growth dynamics 
of the brain and body are another key to language evolution. The birth of the human 
body in a relatively early stage of brain maturation and the considerable difference 
in brain plasticity and adaptive capacity compared to chimpanzees constitutes an 
important pre-adaptation for language use and language learning. 
The change in the geometry of the larynx is one of the preconditions for spoken 
language, and it separates two major concavities; the tongue, which moves between 
them, can regulate the proportion between these “resonators”. This proportion 
controls the formants, i.e., the central frequency bands of vowels. Thus, the articu-
lation of vowels and velar pharyngeal consonants is due to the deeper and vertically 
transformable larynx.4 The reduction of the temporal muscles in humans is another 
signiﬁcant feature in the evolution of the phonic repertoire (cf. Fitch [25]: 263). 
The vertical position of the teeth and the closed circle of teeth in humans make the 
articulation of frontal consonants (dental, alveolar) possible. 
In general, it seems that many anatomical and cognitive dispositions for a spoken 
language were already present before the separation of the lineages of Neanderthals 
and modern humans. Calculations based on the mutation rate in mitochondria point to 
a period of 660,000 ± 140,000 years BP and for the DNA of 440.00 to 270,000 years 
BP (cf. Dediu and Levinson [19]: 188).5 It fully evolved in the phase of species 
formation. Still, it could have remained dormant until dramatic changes in the 
ecology or migrations out of Africa and inside Africa triggered a quick expansion 
of linguistic competencies and led to the divergence of languages with the distance 
of the migration routes.6 Those who argue that language evolved later, say around 
50,000 years BP, must reintroduce some (God-given) miracle or some macro mutation 
incompatible with evolutionary biology.7 
4 The nursing baby can still breathe and drink simultaneously because both pathways are indepen-
dent. A sub-velar position of the epiglottis has also been observed in other primates (cf. Starck [55]: 
586). 
5 Based on climatological data and a computer simulation of benign conditions for different species 
of hominins Timmermann et al. [59] suggest that the evolution of Homo sapiens is located between 
the disappearance of the Homo heidelbergensis (415,000–310,000 y. BP) and the appearance of 
Homo sapiens (in the archeological ﬁndings) 300,000–200,000 y. BP. 
6 At the genome level, Neanderthals and Denisovan hominids share the variant of the FOXP2 gene 
that distinguishes humans from chimpanzees. FOXP2 is a gene that was shown to be responsible 
for disabilities in language development if defective, cf. Fisher [24]. 
7 Chomsky [16]: 58) assumes that 100,000 years ago, there were no languages, but about 
50,000 years ago, the human language existed in many forms. He writes:”The evidence is compelling 
that since then the language faculty has remained essentially unchanged” (ibidem). In Hauser et al.

Motor programs and their further morphogenesis are linked to the emergence 
of stone industries in the history of the human species. The ﬁrst stone axes were 
produced around 2 million years BP. They make up the so-called pebble culture. 
Artifacts not only hint at the cognitive level of humans, but are also linked to social 
life. To produce artifacts and to keep ﬁre, a socially organized exploitation of the 
environment, a division of labor, and a mode of the social distribution of products 
must be in place. This capacity requires rules of collective behavior, and language 
is the prototype of rule-governed social behavior; it not only helps to represent and 
enact social behavior, but it is also the central symbolic representation of social 
behavior. 
The following section summarizes major bifurcations in the morphogenesis of the 
language capacity of pre-humans and humans. Bifurcation presupposes periods of 
structural stability, a transition zone, often dependent on aleatory and multiple causes, 
and a phase of structural stabilization after the transition. Therefore, adequate models 
must contain concepts of structural stability and abrupt changes (catastrophes). The 
mathematical models proposed by René Thom, Hermann Haken, and others are 
the proper background for such an analysis. We shall, however, limit mathematical 
arguments to a minimum. 
6.1.2 
Bifurcation Scenarios in the Morphogenesis 
of Language Capacity 
In higher apes (e.g., chimpanzees), one ﬁnds two means of social communication: 
grooming (lousing, caring for one another) and social calls. The (manual) grooming 
mode dominates, consuming about 20% of the budget. The critical transition (from 
the common ancestors of chimpanzees and men to australopithecines) was probably a 
dominance shift due to larger groups (cf. Dunbar [21]) and richer social connectivity 
in groups. Moreover, the loss of fur, probably due to an adaptation to long-range 
running during daytime under the sun, reduced the grooming functionality. This 
development already began 4 million years before the present (BP). As a result, 
phonic communication was more time-economic, and phonic contact with socio-
emotional content largely replaced bodily contact. 
Figure 6.1 illustrates this shift of dominance, which had to cross a point of 
symmetry.
Studies of the behavior of apes in the wilderness have shown that some species 
have a simple system of calls with referential functions. They allow the other members 
of the group to distinguish different dangers. These may stem from animals like eagles 
(attacking from above), carnivores (e.g., lions attacking below), and snakes (creeping
([32]: 22–26), a language faculty in the broad sense (FLB) is separated from a language faculty in the 
narrow sense (FLN). The latter is a computational faculty, including recursion and discrete inﬁnity. 
As in the basic publication of Chomsky [14], language is reduced to a set-theoretical automaton, 
excluding all questions of reference and social function, the FLN is a “ghost construction”.

in the trees).8 Parallel to this simple system, bodily motions, gestures, and gaze 
directions give communicative cues, which allow for a spatial interpretation. They 
can thus be elaborated into a “language” of body postures and gestures. Therefore, 
the rich system of gestural signals was functionally parallel to a poorer system of 
calls.9 For example, let us take the gestures of the hand. It is clear that as soon as 
hands are fully occupied with other functions like carrying tools and objects, or if 
communication occurs in the dark or at a distance (with obstacles between), the 
gestural “language” is ineffective. As such circumstances probably prevailed in the 
ecology of the australopithecines that lived in the savannah, and as the ear had to 
increase its capacity for discrimination due to the permanent danger of carnivores 
in the environment, the bimodality between reference by gesture and reference by 
phonic articulation shifted toward the latter. Figure 6.2 illustrates this transition. 
8 Hauser et al. ([32]: 31) argue that the calls lack intentionality and that the animals (velvet and 
rhesus monkeys) are only able to extract information from the acoustic signals. As we cannot 
interview monkeys, the question of intentionality must remain open. It would, however, be sufﬁcient 
if a cooperative practice was genetically prepared and quickly developed in these species. Brain 
scanning results show that learning does not presuppose consciousness, thus even very low levels 
of consciousness in hominids would not preclude social learning of signs and their meaning, cf. 
Henke et al. [33]. 
9 Kendon [38] shows that “some of the important capacities for the oral-vocal actions required 
for speech can be found quite widely in various non-human primate species, suggesting a long 
evolutionary history.” (ibidem 73).

The result of this functional evolution lies midway between biological and cultural 
evolution insofar as the repertoire of manual behavior in grooming and gestures and 
the repertoire of social and referential calls is acquired. Relatively to higher apes, 
the resulting protolanguage probably contained a rather large “lexicon” of social 
and referential calls (e.g., about 30 to 50 patterns), with different types of evaluative 
modulations (social calls) and categorical distinctions (referential calls). This stage 
prepares a referentially motivated sign architecture, i.e., language. 
The capacity for imitation of phonic material, quick and stable memory entries and 
corresponding search procedures, and semantic network-building faculties presup-
pose a better-organized brain (cortex, centers of auditory and visual detection) and 
enough space (synaptic connectivity) to build a memory that associates phonic 
patterns with other (visual, olfactory) cues. This evolution leads us to a third bifurca-
tion. It concerns imitation and learning in the case of motor behavior and symbol use. 
The baseline is deﬁned by the presence of mirror neurons in higher primates and their 
capability of quick motor learning and motor control (cf. Rizzolatti and Arbib [52]) 
and the rise of a theory of mind in late hominins (e.g., chimpanzees). The bifurcation 
occurs between simple emulation and stable cultures with rich traditions. Simple 
“cultures” of tool use have even been documented for chimpanzees (cf. Boesch 
[10]). They are still linked to immediate success (reward) but prepare a more general 
strategy of imitation and learning from others without immediate pragmatic support 
(or “grounding”; cf. Cangelosi et al. [13]). In computer simulations, this distinction 
is called the “toil” versus “theft” strategy. In the case of symbolic learning, a label is 
either learned concerning its referent via trial and error or “stolen” from the symbolic 
behavior of others (the semantics are ﬁlled in later). Human infants systematically 
are “symbolic thieves” in the sense of these experiments. Human cultures accumulate 
information transmitted without being applied and tested extensively by every user. 
Dawkins called this information “memes”; cf. Blackmore [8] (Fig. 6.3). 
The phonic protolanguage that integrated social and referential communication 
and was able to receive and transmit the accumulated cultural knowledge must have

Spain; cf. Wildgen [80].

reached a ﬁrst plateau, which was sufﬁcient for the survival of this new species11 
and allowed its migration into Eurasia and its diffusion into Africa (Homo sapiens). 
The biological morphogenesis underlying the emergence of the language capacity 
of all human populations asks for this process’s unusual rapidity and effectiveness. 
In the following section, we consider the hypercycle hypothesis introduced by Eigen 
and Schuster [22] in the context of the evolution of life on earth to explain the rapid 
evolution of human language.12 
6.1.3 
Autocatalytic Dynamics and the Evolutionary 
Hypercycle 
The autocatalytic features are evident in the case of viral replication and variation, 
given the extreme efﬁciency of these systems. The simple catalytic cycle uses some 
catalyst (mediator) in the environment, and the rate of replication depends on the 
concentration of the catalyst. In the case of hypercycles, the system produces the 
medium (catalyst). As a consequence, the rate of replication does not grow exponen-
tially. Instead, it grows hyperbolically, which allows for rapid evolutionary processes. 
However, hypercycles have other essential features: 
• If different replication systems co-occur, the hypercycle can bind them together, 
eliminate rivaling (not bound) processes and stabilize the cooperative system (the 
hypercycle is a synergetic system; cf. Haken [29]: 315 f.). 
• The whole cycle acts like one unit, rivals other hypercycles (if they exist), and 
eliminates less organized processes. 
• The single systems bound by the hypercycle can still work with low complexity, 
but the cooperative system has access to higher levels of complexity. 
• The hypercycle can reach optimality without external selection pressures. 
Despite these advantages, hypercycles are endangered by changes in the external 
milieu. Suppose the biological or symbolic system survives for some period. In 
that case, it can trigger an all-or-none decision in the evolutionary line because all 
alternatives have been eliminated, and further evolution cannot return to an earlier 
situation. The evolution must follow the direction chosen during the operation of 
the hypercycle. In a sense, the hypercycle reduces the potential for selection and 
determines long-term evolution. It leads to a sequence of steps that seem to follow
11 Although we know nothing about communication in Homo erectus, the principle of evolutionary 
continuity (on which Darwin founded his theses) motivates the hypothesis of a protolanguage, i.e.  
a way of phonic communication that preﬁgures the language typical for our species. For example, it 
could correspond to children’s one- and two-word utterances in their early second year of language 
acquisition or rudimentary pidgins. 
12 This hypothesis was ﬁrst presented at the conference “The Cradle of Language” (Stellenbosch, 
South Africa, 7th to10th of November 2006) and published in an elaborated version in Wildgen 
[77]. 

6.1 Biological Predispositions for the Morphogenesis of Human Language

logically from an underlying principle. It looks like an intelligent design, although 
it only exploits natural processes and obeys the laws of nature. 
Non-coupled self-replicative units guarantee the conservation of a limited amount 
of information that can be passed on from generation to generation. This proves to be 
one of the necessary prerequisites of Darwinian behavior, i.e., selection and evolu-
tion. Similarly, catalytic hypercycles are also selective, but in addition, they have 
integrating properties, which allow for cooperation between otherwise competitive 
units. Yet, they compete even more violently than Darwinian species with any replica-
tive entity not being part of their own. Furthermore, they can establish global forms of 
organization as a consequence of their once-for-ever-selection behavior, which does 
not permit a coexistence with other hypercyclic systems, unless these are stabilized 
by higher-order linkages’ (Eigen and Schuster [22]: 6). 
The most dramatic difference between physiological microevolution and symbolic 
(linguistic) macroevolution concerns the fact that the ﬁrst one stores and activates the 
phylogenetic memory of a species, whereas the latter stores the historical/cultural and 
the individual/biographical memory. The exciting feature of catalytic and hypercyclic 
organizations is that they enable faithful replication and dramatic selection by their 
hyperbolic growth. This means that all types of organizations, not part of an operative 
hypercycle (i.e., all competitors at a lower level), are repressed. In the following, this 
promising but abstract model is ﬁlled with further details from human evolution. 
One can choose two application routes: cognitive (neural) and social (cultural). The 
cognitive and the social route enter a cycle of coordination, which tends to induce 
individuals to select cultural content as cognitive content and to eliminate much 
potential content which is not socially relevant. This strongly selective (hyper) cycle 
may be called socio-cognitive. In the two periods in which new behavior surfaced (cf. 
at the stage of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens), the socio-cognitive hypercycle has 
selected humans for symbolic competence. In the co-evolutionary system between a 
cognizable ecology and symbolic competence, the following hierarchy is plausible: 
(a) 
Already in the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans (LCA), 
contextual space acts as an external memory of affordances, which is indexically 
given by paths of social locomotion and predator/prey-locomotion, harvesting 
locations (and times), dangerous locations, places for sleep, courtship, housing, 
and frontiers of territories. Moreover, these indexically loaded areas and places 
function as a catalyst of social action as they coordinate social perception and 
action. 
(b) As soon as social space is more organized explicitly concerning its perception 
and social use, it unfolds in a cycle of social “investment”. Architecture and the 
spatial organization of a village (or later a town) are clear examples. This level 
is autocatalytic as the spatial organization becomes a cyclic structure in which 
different functions cooperate. Figure 6.4 sketches such an autocatalytic cycle.
In each subspace, speciﬁc symbolic media are evolved. Thus, the painted Pale-
olithic cave (in the Franco-Cantabric culture) is a speciﬁcation of the mythical/ritual 
space and is also connected by its illusionist paintings to the outside space of hunting. 
The relation is iconic, indexical (in its magical impact), and symbolic (in its abstract

signs; cf. Wildgen [74]: 80–83; [75]). The dark, painted cave points to cave openings, 
and later, huts where people live. The open space in front of the cave openings or 
huts is a public space where the production of artifacts and the distribution of shared 
food occur. This public space borders the open ﬁeld of chasing and harvesting. 
Human action patterns occur inside a speciﬁc space or make the transition from one 
space to the neighboring one. In rituals, the core of these action patterns is ﬁxed. 
The coding of action patterns by rituals is a social preparation/presupposition for 
linguistic rules/grammar. 
In further development, a new level of symbolic consciousness is reached when 
different symbolic modes (e.g., languages and myths) clash, e.g., in the large 
Neolithic societies of Egypt and Mesopotamia. The single ﬁelds in Fig. 6.4 reor-
ganize in a hypercycle that produces a new, standardized symbolic system, e.g., 
a codiﬁed religion and a written language. Possibly the Franco-Cantabric culture 
(35,000–13,000 y. BP) and the Sahara cultures (later) had already reached this level. 
However, as the code of their abstract signs cannot be deciphered, this hypothesis 
cannot be substantiated. 
In the course of cultural evolution, the effects of integration imply a network of 
symbolic forms. Symbolic forms are the manifestations of social knowledge, and 
language is the most prominent symbolic form that codes social knowledge. At the 
“higher” levels of learning, processes of self-organized reconstruction play a decisive 
role. Speciﬁc institutions had to be created to stabilize the social knowledge level or 
even increase it. The new codes called “religious code” and “written language” are 
at the heart of such institutions (cf. Chap. 5). 
The symbolic forms are multiple and, in their speciﬁc elaboration, they are 
not species-universal, i.e., every separated community develops different symbolic 
systems, for instance, languages and dialects. Nevertheless, they are comparable 
via common principles of morphogenesis applied at different ontological levels (cf. 
Chap. 7).

6.2 The Semantics of Space and Time in a Protolanguage
151
6.2 
The Semantics of Space and Time in a Protolanguage 
One can distinguish two aspects: processes in space, such as spatial orientation and 
navigation, and temporal classiﬁcations and rhythmical patterns. The representa-
tion of space has to do with frontiers (their transition) and perspectives. A ﬁrst 
perspective is centrifugal, i.e., starting from the self and its bodily motions and 
locomotions, an ‘experienced’ three-dimensional space is cognized: in front of–be-
hind (go), above–below (climb, fall), and left–right (grasp with the left hand or the 
right hand). This space of bodily motion with feet and arms deﬁnes the immediate 
space where objects may be approached, reached, and manipulated. The intermediate 
space depends on man’s ecology; it can be the housing; ﬁrst, the cave, the shelter 
(“abri”); later, the village; the distal space contains roughly all possible itineraries 
(of hunting/gathering). The second perspective is centripetal, i.e., the self is seen 
as the place of effects triggered by external causes. The sky, the horizon (speciﬁc 
points where the sun sets or rises), the favored direction of winds, and the ridge of 
mountains may be the external locus of orientation for the self, who is at the center 
of a force ﬁeld implicit in these delimitations. Many myths and religions refer to 
this extreme locus of orientation as they interpret the fate of humans as standing 
under the control of such distant (and often invisible) forces. The cognizing of such 
schemata for orientation may only show up in behavior (as it does in many animals), 
it may be gestured, or it can be deictically organized in a phonic language.13 For the 
Homo erectus, the cognizing space is clear. The inner space is deﬁned by hands and 
instruments, and the medium space by choice of dwelling places (to which the group 
could return). The centripetal organization is involved in long-range excursions and 
migration. As the orientation system cannot be genetically coded, it must be learned, 
adapted to changing contexts, and socially shared. Language is one possible solution 
to this problem, be it gestural (behavioral) or phonic. As humans have chosen the 
path of phonation, it is plausible that our ancestors began to proceed in this direction. 
A protolanguage must categorize events and actions (by proto-verbs) and discrim-
inate stable entities (by proto-nouns). The question arises as to whether temporal, 
dynamic, quantitative, and qualitative relations between them can be mastered, and 
if so, to what degree. 
The manufacturing of stone tools (and a fortiori of tools shaped with the help 
of stone tools) goes cognitively beyond the basic grasp scenario. One hand (or one 
foot) must ﬁx the pebble, and the other hand grasps the stone or bone which hits the 
stone. Finally, the planned breaking off subtracts material from the chosen stone and 
produces the desired sharp edge of the pebble after several strokes. This scenario 
involves two objects, two hands, and a change in the shape of the pebble (the sepa-
ration of parts from it). Additionally, it manifests a branching sequence and iteration 
characteristic of the syntactic organization in natural languages (cf. phrase structures 
and repeated embedding).
13 Cf. the research on types of orientation in different ethnic groups, e.g., research conducted at the 
Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen by the group of Prof. Levinson; cf. Levinson 
[43].

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
6.3 
The Morphogenetic Transition Between 
a Protolanguage and Full-Fletched (Modern) 
Languages 
Our empirical knowledge concerning languages is based on the observation of 
historical languages documented in writing (e.g., Sanskrit, classical Greek, Latin, 
or Arabic) and the research on living languages, dialects, and sociolects. There-
fore, hypotheses concerning unwritten, prehistorical languages and a fortiori, the 
stadium of protolanguage, must extrapolate our knowledge about known languages 
and refer to more general principles known from biology or neurology. Therefore, 
such hypotheses are just well-informed guesses. Nevertheless, they contribute to a 
global view of human cognition and culture and are relevant. 
6.3.1 
The Self-Organization of a Grammatical System 
Self-organization is a principle formulated in the framework of cybernetics (Ashby 
[5]) and involves the search for a stable state in a deterministic system. As already 
programmatically expressed by Norbert Wiener [65], it is extrapolated from physical 
to biological, eventually symbolic systems. Moreover, in morphogenesis, equilibria 
and attractors (stable states) are also central notions. Therefore, self-organization and 
morphogenesis follow a similar strategy of explanation. 
Kirby [39] argues that compositionality (and thus syntax) can already emerge if 
the size of the lexicon (meanings associated with linguistic expression) increases. 
“The number of meanings covered increases dramatically, as does the size of the 
grammar” (ibid. 313f). Steels [56] simulates language evolution based on evolu-
tionary games. A stable state emerges when the number of meanings increases, and 
due to organizational economy, the size of the grammar drops. Given the lexicon’s 
speciﬁc size and the transmission dynamics (learning), languages tend to evolve a 
rather general syntax without any pressure from environmental or sexual selection. 
Fitch ([25]: 385) is skeptical about the relevance of computer simulation for 
studying evolution. He writes: “In practice, however, the demonstration of a theoret-
ical possibility does not by itself, tell us how the pattern was ‘discovered’ evolution-
arily”. This is true,but if we cannot observe or ﬁnd documents of such a discovery, we 
must still choose between different theoretical possibilities. The simulation provides 
better arguments than aprioristic deductions from deﬁnitions like “recursive power” 
or the necessary existence of universal grammar (in Chomsky’s tradition). 
The purely syntactic problem of chaining elements of an existent vocabulary does 
not require a speciﬁc endowment and evolutionary processes enabling it. The real 
problem is semantic compositionality because the composition or blending of spaces 
with different topologies and the account of the dynamics inherent in verbs is crucial 
for sentential units. This tremendous problem must be resolved to allow stable and

reliable communication via phrases and sentences. To arrive at a conventionalized 
system of syntactic behavior, early humans had to consider two major factors: 
• The cognitive demands for a stable solution of semantic compositionality, 
• and the communicative and social demands for a compositional level of referen-
tiality. 
The solution to this problem is the gain of the evolutionary game called human 
language. 
Even if the cognitive capacity was given, human society must still have a strong 
demand for high performance. Probably rewarding situations often arose by chance, 
and the evolving species spontaneously used the “dormant “ capacity. As soon as 
a protolanguage was developed, it brought about long traditions of language usage 
up until modern times. The central question is not how syntax came about but what 
made it rewarding to use the available cognitive potential for syntax. The payoff can 
be a social or an individual one (which can lead to higher social competence and 
thus to social gain). A plausible model for such higher communicative demands due 
to social evolution is still missing. 
6.3.2 
Further Steps of Complexiﬁcation in Language 
Sentential patterns may be elementary even in human languages, e.g., in pidgins, 
in learner languages, and even in standard languages with broad usage (e.g., the 
so-called minimal languages analyzed by Gil [27]). Human utterances are, however, 
not restricted to isolated sentences. On the contrary, natural units are sequences of 
sentences, so-called turns in conversation, adjacent pairs as in question–answer, and 
narratives or arguments. A fundamental problem concerns the stratum of language 
(from phonology to discourse) to which a selection process applies. As this is usually 
the level of holistic behavior, we presume that textual behavior is the proper level 
on which selection effects play a role. Therefore, human evolution must have been 
selected for the effective use of language in social communication and not at the level 
of sentences or words. These levels are only selection relevant insofar as they allow 
the construction of coherence in narratives, descriptions, or arguments. The increase 
of the lexicon and the availability of case-frames (action–schemata) and spatial cate-
gorizations establish the source domain, in which a very complex grammar system 
could emerge by self-organization. Another source domain in the morphogenesis of 
phrasal and sentential syntax is the capacity for producing and understanding a rapid 
sequence of phonic events due to short- and long-term phonetic memory. Studdert-
Kennedy ([58]: 17) says: “Without a pre-adapted system for storing phonetic struc-
ture independently from its meaning, syntax could not have begun to evolve.” Man’s 
essential syntagmatic (sequence controlling) capacities are evident in morphological 
and phrase compositionality. The complexity of syntax seems overwhelming if we 
consider modern written languages that are the focus of most linguists. However,

154
6
The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
natural languages can be elementary on the syntactic level. Therefore, it is not neces-
sary to consider this complexity as a general characteristic of human languages. They 
can achieve such complexity, but this is not necessary. Comrie and Kuteva ([17]: 202) 
conclude from their comparative analysis that “human language(s) might have been 
much simpler and highly functional, and might have lacked grammatical forms such 
as case inﬂections, agreement, voice markers, etc.” 
6.3.3 
Summary of the Evolutionary Morphogenesis 
of Human Languages 
The biological evolution of human language is a continuous process in which bodily 
preconditions are decisive. In the furthersocial evolution that started with the increase 
of group size (and group organization) and new forms of symbolically ruled social 
behavior, bifurcations with symmetry-breaking and convergence occurred: from 
manual to phonic contact management, from gestural to phonic deixis and refer-
ential location, and from context-dependent emulation to cultural learning. After 
these dramatic shifts toward a complex phonic communication system with socio-
emotional and referential functions and cultures based on symbolic transmission, 
the centrality of language for human survival and expansion was ﬁrmly established. 
Language capacity became a species-deﬁning character of humans. 
The advanced stone-age industries show that Homo sapiens crossed this barrier 
before they began to move beyond their limits in South-Eastern Africa (200–100,000 
y. BP) and to migrate out of Africa (between 100,000 and 70,000 y BP); cf. Wildgen 
([74]: Chaps. 4 and 5) and Wildgen [81]. 
The signiﬁcant effects on language were: 
• A more extensive and steadily growing lexicon; 
• the mastery of rapid and complex strings of phonic signals and corresponding 
functional-semantic patterns as shown in lexical innovation, composition, gram-
maticalization, and complex phrasal syntax; 
• a new level of creativity in language and art linked to the growing complexity and 
diversity of languages.

Morphogenetic Schematization in the Lexicon

The following sections give a summary of a morphogenetic model of human 
language. The focus is not only on speciﬁc biological processes in the actual forma-
tion of a living being (e.g., gastrulation, cell division, and the genetic or epigenetic 
control of maturation and growth), but also on the existence and the further unfolding

of abstract “morphogenetic” forms in the sense of Kant’s schema-theory, Goethe’s 
“Urformen”, Saint-Hilaire’s “structural plan”. 
Modern evolutionary biology accepts the persistence of a set of ancient genetic 
factors (the “homeobox”) responsible for a kind of “unity of composition” observed 
by Saint-Hilaire in comparative anatomy (see the rise of “Evo-devo-models”). We 
cannot discuss these issues in evolutionary theory (cf. our remarks in Sect. 1.1.2). The 
underlying philosophical and theoretical position was already formulated in René 
Thom’s book (1972, translation 1975: Structural Stability and Morphogenesis), and 
its consequences for linguistics and semiotics have been speciﬁed in Petitot [48] and 
Wildgen [66, 68, 70, 72]. 
6.4.1 
Morphogenetic Principles Versus Universal Grammar 
The topic of universal grammar or inborn ideas surfacing in an incomplete and 
deformed way in human languages goes back to antiquity and is lined to the topic of 
the naturalness of language contrasted with the appearance of arbitrariness (conven-
tionality); cf. Platon‘s dialogue Cratylus. Descartes‘ epistemology and the theory of 
grammar and rhetoric of Port Royal assumed a logical blueprint of human language 
(logic understood as a theory of human thought). Chomsky assumed this histor-
ical position to be the backbone of his theory of Universal Grammar, based on 
set theory and (free) algebra (cf. Chomsky [14, 15]). In the seventeenth century, 
Leibniz had already criticized the rationalistic position of Descartes and advocated 
a continuous and dynamic view of universals and grammar. Leibniz’s ideas for 
universal geometrical characteristics of human thinking and creativity led to the 
modern topology. Poincaré’s philosophy of science and the applications of results 
in differential topology by René Thom and Sir Christopher Zeeman (under the label 
“catastrophe theory” in the seventies and eighties of the twentieth century) estab-
lished a theoretical framework for dynamic semiotics and linguistics, cf. Wildgen 
([69]: 31f.) for a short historiographical discussion. We take as our starting point the 
natural sciences and mathematics before and after the millennium (2000), speciﬁcally 
the morphogenetic theorizing by René Thom. 
Starting from morphogenesis in the domain of nature (for instance, geological 
and biological processes), René Thom has proposed formal schemata derived from 
catastrophe theory that generalize major types of morphogenetic evolutions. In the 
grammar of human languages, such process types show up as invariant form-giving 
principles that constitute a “homeobox” constitutive for homologies between human 
languages. We do not assume the existence of universal grammar (based on innate 
“ideas”) but a gradient in the invention and selection of grammatical forms that leads 
to the statistical prominence of certain types of grammatical organization (construc-
tions). This does not mean that grammatical structures whose genesis can take thou-
sands of years are the immediate outcome of speciﬁc morphogenetic processes. One 
must instead assume myriads of communicative acts involving entire populations 
that create ad hoc lexical ad syntactic patterns, select among a given inventory, and

156
6
The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
change them in detail. The cumulative outcome of these processes selects and opti-
mizes certain organization features in the lexicon and the syntax.14 The details of such 
a long-term process with many degrees of freedom cannot be reconstructed in linguis-
tics (in the present state). Therefore, the morphogenetic analysis of grammar must 
take a detour and use the morphogenetic patterns abstracted from nature and seek 
plausible patterns discovered in languages until now that are possible realizations of 
these abstract morphogenetic structures. For a detailed analysis of catastrophe theo-
retic semantics motivated by René Thom’s proposals, see the analyses in Wildgen 
([66, 72]; in English; [68, 70] in German; [73, 82], in French) and Petitot [48–50]. 
Finding the most basic entities underlying a set of complex structures is similar 
to the search for basic ﬁgures in geometry. The analogy between geometry and 
psychobiological phenomena was already known to Aristotle (in his treatise on 
psychology, “De Anima”, Aristoteles, [4]: § 414b16). The abstract geometrical char-
acter of elementary representations is also evident in neurophysiology (see Orban 
[46]) and in the psychology of vision Kosslyn [40], cf. for the discussion of this 
research and its relation to Thomian thought Petitot [51]. The analysis of sensory 
inputs consists of mappings from a three-dimensional input into a precise control 
of activity in space and time. The mapping must conserve essential topological and 
dynamic characteristics and can forget metrical details and variations of a type of 
object or event. Therefore, the problem of structurally stable mapping lies at the 
heart of every theory of representation and semantics. The crucial result in this ﬁeld 
is the theorem by Whitney that says: We can only ﬁnd three types of points (all other 
types become identical to these if perturbed): 
(1) regular points (Morse points); they do not qualitatively change under perturba-
tion; we may say that they have a static identity (of self-regulation), 
(2) fold-points (a frontier line between a stable and an unstable domain appears), 
(3) cusp-points (two stable attractors conﬂict and one may appear or disappear). 
The classiﬁcation theorem of catastrophe theory expanded this list to the cuspo‚ıds 
and umbilics. After 1978, the embedding of umbilics in the double cusp was added 
(cf. Wildgen [66]: 81–92). 
A further notion must be informally introduced: the linear path in an elementary 
unfolding.15 If we consider linear paths in an unfolding, we can classify types of 
process schemata called EMISSION, CAPTURE, and (bimodal) CHANGE. They 
are derived from the catastrophe set (set of extrema) of the cusp. The diagrammatic
14 Evidence from language change documented by historical and comparative linguistics indicates 
that stability is maintained against forces of destabilization or new optima are sought. For example, 
Steels [57] simulated the language change from Old High German (ca.800–1000 AD) to New High 
German (ca. 1650–today) using computer agents in a language game. He concludes, “Although 
there have been phonetic processes (unrelated to function) that have eroded endings and merged 
forms, only those solutions that lead to a more optimal system from the viewpoint of semantics, 
morphosyntax, and phonology have undergone positive selection.”(ibidem 348). 
15 In the simplest case, the unfolding of a dynamical system under deformation (noise or perturba-
tion) has a gradient dynamic without oscillations or chaos. This assumption allows the classiﬁcation 
of all the structurally stable evolutions of the system. The practical consequences of the classiﬁcation 
theorem are called “catastrophe theory”.

simpliﬁcation at the right of Fig. 6.5 eliminates the lines of (unstable) maxima; the 
circles symbolize the bifurcation points. 
Thom proposed considering only catastrophes with a (co-)dimension equal to 
or lower than the dimensionality of spacetime. The basic scenarios of change and 
process in the cusp have two attractors. The butterﬂy has three attractors, and the 
elliptic umbilic has four attractors. Examples of these formal process types are given 
in the following sections. 
We shall concentrate on the levels of lexicon and sentential syntax. Applications 
of the morphogenetic paradigm to phonology have been published in Wildgen ([70] 
in German and [72] in English). Applications in text linguistics, narrative analysis, 
and discourse are not considered here due to lack of space (cf. Wildgen [67], Wildgen 
[72, 73]: 229–263; in French). 
6.4.2 
Morphogenetic Structures in the Lexicon of Verbs 
The lexical category of verbs that logicians traditionally neglected16 becomes 
the theoretical core of a morphogenetic analysis. The ﬁrst questions that the 
categorization of a process, an event, or an action raises are: 
• What invariant structures underly the processes in question such that a lexicon of 
verbs can stably refer to them? 
• What are the motor controls and perceptual patterns that mentally appropriate 
such processes?
16 See for example the logic of Port Royal which wanted to reduce this part of the lexicon to the 
single verb “to be”.

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
• Finally, what mental representations link the perceptual-motor correlate and the 
linguistic forms? 
We start from the psychophysical interface, i.e., the perceptual and motor systems, 
which establish a link between the world and the human body. As the work of Gibson 
[26] and, more recently, that of Haken [30] and Kelso [37], and others show, the qual-
itative laws of external physics control this interface. The motor programs modify the 
autonomous dynamics of the body’s extremities and their contact with objects (e.g., 
the ﬂoor for the feet). These autonomous dynamic structures determine variables for 
the perception of movements and the cognition that regulates these systems. It can be 
concluded that the brain reﬂects the external dynamics (by adding other parameters 
to it and distorting it in its metric). However, the question remains: Does this coor-
dination with external physics also control the higher levels of cognition, especially 
linguistic cognition? We assume an intermediate level, called imaginal or schematic. 
It applies processes that become increasingly independent from the psychophysical 
grounding and more context-dependent (as a consequence, they depend on chance). 
In what follows, we will start from the psychophysical level to ﬁnd schematizations 
(imaginal representations) that underlie the semantics of verbs. We distinguish three 
typical levels of organization in the lexicon of verbs and the syntax of verb phrases 
(the lexicon of nouns and the syntax of noun phrases will be the topic of the next 
section): 
a. Locomotion and its linguistic schematization, 
b. 
the control of an object by an agent, 
c. and the interaction between agents. 
ad a: The morphogenesis of the cognitive and semantic schematization of motor 
acts. 
The psychophysical perspective has the advantage of creating a link between the 
cognitive, the sensory-motor, and the dynamics of the external world. Movements 
have two levels of control): 
a. Control of the topology of the movement and the coordination of the different 
moving parts. 
b. 
Control of the metric of the movement. It gives the necessary precision for a 
concrete situation/environment. 
The ﬁrst level eliminates factors that blur the general approach of a target. In this 
sense, the coarse (topological) control is locally teleological. Metrical control, on 
the contrary, has the effect of adjusting the movement and eliminating insecurities 
and vagueness. 
In the case of the movement of the body’s extremities (e.g., legs, arms), one can 
use the physical description of the pendulum (double pendulum) as a fundamental 
schema. Figure 6.6 shows the correspondence between the double pendulum and the 
walking motion. The movement of the body supported by the hips is in coordination 
with the relative movements of the thigh (measured at the knee) and the leg (measured 
at the ankle).

159
Fig. 6.6 The movements of the double pendulum and of a leg in walking 
By moving from the rest position, the leg moves toward the goal, the new attractor. 
The iteration of local movements allows for a quasi-continuous movement. The 
rhythm of it can further specify the movement or even identify the agent of the 
movement. The movement zones with a very high degree of coordinated control are, 
at the same time, the domains that organize semiotic expression, for instance, the 
facial muscles and the movement of the hands and ﬁngers. The complexity of motor 
programs is not directly related to lexical distinctions because the latter only classify 
recurrent types of movement in a much coarser way. 
Speciﬁc movements are directed toward an attractor (a target). This orientation 
implies a separation of the starting and the ending point. This bimodality corresponds 
to the fundamental transition in space and its lexical correlates. Example: enter/exit 
or come/leave. Two essential types of elaboration must be considered: 
(1) Instrumental elaboration. The control of the body’s limbs and the coordination 
of complex movements can be modiﬁed or speciﬁed by inventing and using 
instruments (and machines). 
(2) Causal elaboration. Further technical control uses the physical causalities 
discovered and implemented in science and technology. 
ad b: The morphogenesis of an agent’s control over an object. 
In the intentional act of an agent directed at a less intentional object or entity, two 
aspects can be distinguished: 
(a) 
The conﬁgurational aspect describes the topological and kinematic relations 
between the agent and object. 
(b) The energetic (or intentional) aspect introduces the force of the agent and the 
effect of this force on the object. This force is ﬁrst psychic; secondly, it has 
physical effects. 
In their classiﬁcation of the lexicon of German verbs, Ballmer and Brennenstuhl 
[6] distinguish, at this level of complexity, two groups of verbs: 
(1) The creation, destruction, and regeneration of objects (elements of the environ-
ment). 
(2) The subject’s impact on the state of objects and subjects in its environment.

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
For group (1), it is easy to see the correspondence with the emission and capture 
schemata in catastrophe theoretical semantics (cf. Fig. 6.5 in Sect. 6.4.1). In the 
lexicon, the corresponding verbs are, in most cases, divalent, as in: 
EMISSION 
Albert tells a story 
Berthe calculates the result 
CAPTURE 
Charles eats the soup. 
Often the semantic type of the produced objects is incorporated into the verb, as 
shown by the following German verbs (EMISSION type): 
– schneidern (to sew) 
– töpfern (to make pottery) 
– texten (to write texts). 
The subgroup called regeneration/disaggregation by Ballmer and Brennenstuhl 
[6] refers to a space of qualities. We will look at some examples: 
(a) 
verbiegen (distort, twist) 
(b) reinigen (cleanse). 
The processes that are classiﬁed by these verbs refer to a qualitative space with 
the following states: 
1. right > twisted German: verbiegen (deform), 
2. clean > dirty German: reinigen (English: to clean; French: nettoyer). 
In the control space of the cusp (cf. the folded surface in Fig. 6.7), we have paths 
that go from: 
(a) 
(+) → (−): verbiegen (to distort) 
(b) (−) → (+): gerade biegen (to straighten). 
Figure 6.7 shows the dynamic modeling of the French verbs: nettoyer (clean) and 
salir (make dirty) and corresponding adjective scales: propre (clean) and sale (dirty); 
cf. Wildgen ([73]: 99).
ad c: The morphogenesis of the cognitive and semantic schematization of 
interaction. 
An interaction scene that connects several human agents already presupposes a 
very complex perceptual and conceptual analysis in the individual observing the 
scene. Above all, it presupposes a degree of social perception that goes beyond the 
simple control of the action by the agent himself. For example, we know that primates 
can consider the perspective of another (“decentration”) to a degree comparable to the 
decentration manifested by a two-year-old child. From a repertoire of action controls, 
one can reconstruct possible patterns of social interaction. However, it turns out that 
only a small group of these coordinated interactions achieve high stability, allowing 
schematization and semantic classiﬁcation. This restriction requires an explanation.

adjectives clean and dirty
From the angle of the spatial conﬁguration, we can describe the gift, i.e., the 
scene during which two people exchange an object, by the topology of the attentional 
focuses. Petitot ([50]: 272ff) elaborated on a proposal by Christopher Zeeman for a 
model that uses cognitive algorithms, such as cut locus and diffusion contours. In 
this elaboration toward neuro-vision, the catastrophe theoretical model gains more 
theoretical depth because it shows that the mathematics of differential topology can be 
used in the speciﬁc context of visual scene analysis. The semantic archetype would, 
in this perspective, be ﬁrst the result of morphogenesis in visual pattern recognition. 
As such, non-human primates could have possessed this faculty. Then, this pattern 
would have gained social and cultural signiﬁcance in the ritualization of gestures. 
Finally, with the transition to phonic language, evolutionary continuity would have 
created a stable reference pattern in early human communication (Fig. 6.8).
Petitot ([50]: 273) writes: “the temporal evolution of the cut locus itself is slow 
dynamics […] and may present bifurcations, emergence, and vanishing of branches, 
or splitting of branches. These dynamics encode events of interaction between 
actants. We can, in this way, develop a program analogous to contour diffusion. 
Figure 4.8 gives an example of the transfer type”. 
The middle phase (lower left corner) coordinates the activities centered on two 
individuals in the starting and the goal positions; it is also the most unstable point of 
the whole process.

applying principles of neural dynamics in vision (“cut locus” analysis) in Petitot [50]: 274: Fig. 4.8)
This scheme of interaction is transformed into language schematization by transfer 
verbs. The energy asymmetry deﬁnes an intentional direction. We can distinguish: 
• the source agent that initiates a process; 
• the object that changes the possessor going through a change of control and 
dominance; 
• the target agent, the one who holds control of the object at the end. This state is 
the goal of the intentional action of M1, and it establishes, at the same time, an 
asymmetry, which may initiate M3 to fulﬁll a reciprocal exchange (Fig. 6.9). 
The second large ﬁeld of lexical entities has a nominal character and is classically 
labeled as nouns, adjectives, appositions, pronouns, and relative clauses.

6.4.3 
Morphogenesis and Attractor Dynamics in the Lexicon 
of Nouns, Adjectives, and Other Nominal Attributes 
The lexicon of human languages has a high degree of arbitrarity. It was evident 
to the comparatists of the nineteenth century, and de Saussure called this principle 
“l’arbitraire du signe” (the arbitrariness of the (linguistic) sign). Although morpho-
logical and syntactic patterns of the languages in a family of languages can be stable 
over long periods, the lexical entities diverge very quickly. Even the dialects of the 
same language differ dramatically in the labels for plants, animals, and artifacts. This 
variability became evident in the systematic compilation of geographic variation in 
the atlases of languages established at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of 
the twentieth century. 
In lexicology and lexical semantics, since the twenties of the last century, models 
of ﬁeld linguistics came to the fore; the notion of “ﬁeld” implies gradient dynamics. 
However, elementary patterns of lexical semantics were already known in antique 
(Aristotelean) logic and rhetoric. For example, Aristotle used in his taxonomy of 
plants and animals the technique of speciﬁc difference between a general term and a 
more speciﬁc one: “genus proximum et differentia speciﬁca”. This technique can be 
translated into a feature notation, i.e., a term higher in the hierarchy may be deﬁned 
relative to the genus proximum, the next lower term, via the speciﬁc difference 
between them.17 This idea was taken up by Katz and Fodor [36] and used in generative 
grammar after 1965. We shall exemplify the technique based on its usage in Labov 
[41], who elaborated on it in an empirical (sociolinguistic) context. 
The meaning of bowl can be analyzed regarding a set of ﬁve features (deﬁning 
predicates): 
• feature 1: diameter; weight w1, 
• feature 2: height; weight w2, 
• feature 3: the existence of a handle; weight w3, 
• feature 4: use (food–non-food); weight w4, 
• feature 5: material; weight w5. 
The features have different weights, and this weight may even depend on the 
contexts in which the word “bowl” is used. For example, as Labov [41] shows, the 
weight of feature 4 is higher in the context of “kitchen” and “restaurant”, whereas in 
the context of craftwork and art, features 3 and 5 are more relevant. Fuzzy semantics 
(cf. Zadeh [83]) have generalized the use of “weights” as degrees of membership 
of an element in a set with values between 0 and 1 [0,1]. As the scale of values 
is continuous, we can deﬁne maxima and minima on the scale, i.e., use attractor 
dynamics. 
Even the hierarchical branching of lexical items can show attractor dynamics. The 
ethno-taxonomies analyzed by Berlin [7] and Rosch [53] show the prominence of
17 Darwin appreciated Aristotle’s contribution to biology (in 1882) and D’Arcy Thompson translated 
Aristotle’s History of Animals in 1910. René Thom gave the under title “Physique aristotélienne” 
to his book on Semiophysics (1988). 

164

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
intermediate (Berlin) or basic (Rosch) categories. Thus, the hierarchy in the series 
tool, hammer, and claw-hammer has the term hammer as its center. It is the attractor 
of this array; cf. Sect. 2.1.3 in Wildgen ([76]: 40–42; in German). 
In antique rhetoric, two other relations between lexical items were distinguished: 
metonymy and metaphor. This tradition was transmitted without signiﬁcant losses 
to modernity and is the starting point of the semantics of metaphors in Lakoff and 
Johnson [42]. Thus, the sentences: 
• argument is war (metaphor) 
• the part stands for the whole (metonymy) 
deﬁne a type of semantic transition that can be applied to many words and utter-
ances which ﬁt both arguments of the metaphorical/metonymical relation (cf. ibid. 
4). Examples18 : 
The metaphor:argument is war may be articulated in sentences like: 
• John’s claims are indefensible, 
• His criticisms were right on target, 
• He shot down all my arguments. 
The metonymy: the part stands for the whole is articulated in sentences like: 
• We don’t hire longhairs (longhairs stand for someone having long hair), 
• The Giants need a stronger arm in the right ﬁeld (a strong arm stands for a player 
with strong arms). 
However, some of Lakoff’s and Johnson’s results were basic knowledge in gestalt 
psychology, especially in “attribution theory”, since the ﬁfties of the twentieth 
century. What is new in Lakoff and Johnson [42] is the role played by locutions 
and proverbs like time is money and argument is war.19 
The ﬂaw of lexical semantics lies in the subjectivity (on the part of the analyst) of 
all analyses. Charles Osgood (1916–1991) developed and applied a tool to analyze 
lexical meanings in a near-to-objective technique. It consists of choosing a set of 
polar adjectives in a given language and having experimental subjects rate the relative 
position of lexical items on a seven grades scale. The advantage of this method is 
that the subjective character of meanings is the target of the analysis and does not
18 The “semantics of metaphors” initiated by Lakoff and Johnson is critically analyzed in Wildgen 
([76], Chap. 3, pp. 65–90; in German). 
19 The orientational function of ﬁxed locutions or frequent images points to Jung’s earlier theory of 
psychological archetypes. C.G. Jung collected symbols from many cultures in the form of pictures 
and sculptures and compared them to pictures produced as individual transcriptions of dreams and 
visionary experiences. From the comparison of these materials, he concluded that there is a level 
of the collective, although unconscious, representation, which he called “archetypes” (a term from 
Greek philosophy). He assumed that these (cultural) archetypes cannot be explained by cultural 
heritage or geographical diffusion. Instead, they are rather abstract, geometrical constellations that 
reappear (in Jung’s interpretation independently of one another) in many cultures and individuals 
(see Jung [35]: 45).

interfere with the subjective evaluation or prejudices of the psychologist or linguist 
as an analyst. 
The multivariate statistical analysis leads to a low-dimensional construct of factors 
underlying the correlations between the tested items. One of several optimal factor-
izations is given the typical loading of relevant scales on three factors called Evalu-
ation (E), Potency (P). and Activity (A). Osgood et al. [47] showed that this three-
dimensional semantic space has a biological meaning, i.e., the general factors recon-
structed statistically refer to basic dimensions of human behavior that underlie the 
lexicon of adjectives and nouns. The morphogenesis of the rich semantic space of a 
lexicon can be considered as the unfolding of a low-dimensional, biologically-based 
semantic space. 
In the transition between the lexicon and the syntax of languages, there exist 
processes that are labeled as “grammaticalization”, i.e., items belonging to the lexicon 
are transferred into items having a syntactic function. The opposite direction is also 
relevant; for instance, relative clauses derived from sentential structures acquire the 
character of adjectival determinations or restrictions in a noun phrase. The morpho-
genesis of case markers is one example of grammaticalization. As it is relevant for 
our analysis of valence patterns in Sect. 6.6, it will be discussed in more detail (cf. 
Wildgen [82] for a fuller account in French). 
6.5 
Morphogenesis and Grammaticalization (Applied 
to Case Marking) 
The world’s languages show astonishing diversity in the morphology of words, i.e., in 
sufﬁxes, preﬁxes, and inﬁxes. The basic process, i.e., the transition from (free) lexical 
entities to bound morphemes, is called grammaticalization. This process means 
bound morphemes constituting the grammatical architecture around the lexical stem 
or kernel are the product of transformations, derivations, and abstractions produced 
in a morphogenetic process during linguistic change. A standard example is the 
marking of cases in languages with inﬂection and their functional parallels in other 
languages. Four morphogenetic principles can be detected in this ﬁeld:
(1) Two signiﬁcant types of case systems emerge from research in comparative 
linguistics. Systems with a pair of cases called ergative and absolutive and a 
pair of cases called nominative and accusative. In systems with ergative and 
absolutive cases, the agent in the transitive sentence, which distinguishes an 
agent from a patient, is marked by the ergative case. The agent in the intransitive 
sentence (John runs) and the patient in the transitive sentence (John throws a 
stone) are marked by the same case category: the absolutive.20 These languages 
put their dynamic focus on the agency in the transitive sentence, i.e., the effect of
20 For simplicity, we do not cite original sentences in languages with an ergative/absolutive case 
system but the translation of such sentences into English, a language with a nominative/accusative 
case system.

an agent on a patient. In systems of the nominative/accusative type, the patient 
of the transitive sentence is marked by the case called accusative. In contrast, the 
agent in both sentences is marked by the case called nominative. In English, this 
distinction is shown in the pronouns: He runs, she kisses him, and in the order of 
constituents (the case opposition is: he/she versus him/her). Historical linguists 
discussed whether the two systems have a historical relationship so that marking 
has transitioned. Such a transition could point to an underlying morphogenetic 
process with a bifurcation schema. The choice consists of a pole on the scale of 
the agency. It requires a second term: the patient. A neutral position is a simple 
type of movement/change. Figure 6.10 illustrates this polarity. The historical 
change would then be a catastrophic transition that surfaces in languages with 
a strong marking, for example, by a system of case sufﬁxes or adpositions (see 
the arrow at the bottom).
(2) In the case of a strong marking, appears either a case system of the type: erga-
tive/absolutive (on the left) or nominative/accusative (on the right). The histor-
ical transition takes the form of a bimodal catastrophe. Strong marking can 
traverse a more or less abrupt line of change, while the transition is smooth 
for a weak (or minimal) marking system. This (smooth) transition zone can 
be observed in language contact, where the case marking is lost. In pidgin 
languages, a weak or minimal system uses context and contextual knowledge to 
compensate for the lack of information coded by case marking or adpositions. 
Grammaticalization theories assume a gradient with several steps (see Butt [12]: 
179): relational noun > secondary adposition > primary adposition > morpho-
logical case afﬁx. The languages of Indo-European origin show historical trans-
formations leading to a total or partial disappearance of inﬂectional marking. 
French and English only mark pronouns, but they have elaborate systems of 
prepositions. German marks cases in certain noun forms (in the singular or

6.5 Morphogenesis and Grammaticalization (Applied to Case Marking)
167
according to noun classes) and shows a replacement of case marking by a 
marking based on prepositions. 
(3) The location of the markers depends on the order of the nominal groups 
(syntagmas) in a sentence: Subject (S), Verb (V), Object (O); see the simple 
sentence in German and English: Hans (S) wirft (V) den Stein (O)—John (S) 
throws (V) the stone (O). The whole series of combinations can be found in the 
languages of the world: SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV, and OVS. Beyond this typolog-
ical classiﬁcation, there exist signiﬁcant statistical differences. Thus, the order 
that puts the object in the ﬁrst position is sporadic; the dominant opposition is 
that which puts the subject or the verb in the ﬁrst position. 
(4) Local cases appear especially in languages with an extensive list of cases, such 
as Lesgi (South Dagestan, Caucasus), which has 14 local cases (see Haspel-
math [31]). Case localism is generally pertinent, but the agent’s ﬁeld of forces 
and intentions seems to be the overriding factor. One can call it second-order 
localism. 
Linguistic variation and change have been the central research area of compara-
tive linguistics since its rise in the nineteenth century. Grammatical dynamics were 
discussed under the concept of “grammaticalization” by Antoine Meillet in 1912. 
Today we speak of a cycle of grammaticalization based on a scale that goes from 
lexical entities (especially with concrete, spatial, and imaginal content) to depen-
dent forms to adpositions (prepositions and postpositions) and ﬁnally to endings and 
inﬂectional paradigms. If the inﬂectional system disappears, the dynamic restarts at 
the zero point, i.e., the linear scale is transformed into a cycle. However, cycles of 
grammaticalization often show transposed phases such that several stages coexist. 
Therefore, a language can simultaneously have inﬂectional cases and a set of prepo-
sitions that realize case roles (e.g., German or other Indo-European languages have 
preserved grammatical patterns of the Proto-Indo-European and have replaced many 
instances with prepositions). 
Comparative research has found several routes in the morphogenesis of case 
markers. They can be derived from a chosen inventory of verbs (especially verbs 
of movement and spatial change, often in constructions with serial verbs), nouns 
(often relational), or adverbs. Depending on the typological characteristics of the 
languages or language families, the dynamics can lead to prepositions or postpo-
sitions, sufﬁxes attached to the dependent noun (sometimes also to the verb), or 
dependent pronouns; see Blake ([9]: 170). Grammaticalization gradients function as 
morphogenetic ﬁelds with categorical transitions between: 
• Free lexical units (verb, noun, adverb), 
↓ 
• Linked pronouns, adpositions, 
↓ 
• Sufﬁxes of the noun (more rarely of the verb), 
↓ 
• Inﬂectional paradigms.

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
The morphogenetic modeling in grammar can either consider long-term histor-
ical (at the limit evolutionary) changes or analyze actual and synchronic processes 
occurring in natural languages, i.e., either in actual use or short-term developments 
accessible to observation and analysis. 
6.6 
Morphogenetic Structures in the Syntax of Verbal 
Phrases and Sentences 
In the tradition of Latin grammar, lexical items and morphology were the core. 
However, Humboldt, inspired by his study of polysynthetic languages, demanded 
that the grammar analysis should start from the sentence and not from the word (see 
his work on the language Kawi in Java, 1830–1835; Humbolt [34]). The psycholo-
gist and philosopher Karl Bühler proposed, in 1933, a compromise in the quarrel of 
contemporary linguists on this question. He postulated that any language knows (at 
least) two levels of conventionality, distinguishing it from a code of marine signals. 
These two levels form a scale. At one end, the world is almost torn to shreds, separated 
into isolated aspects so that each “piece” is associated with a (conventional) sign. 
On the other end, language tends to per-construct the same world with the help of 
relations (“Durchkonstruktion”) and to establish meaningful gestalts in this construc-
tion process (see Bühler [11]: 88). Bühler introduces two levels of construction, 
segmentation versus construction. 
In Chomsky’s linguistics, the intermediate notion of the word has been abandoned, 
and the notion of the sentence has become the key notion of grammar. Fillmore 
and Kay show in their “Construction Grammar” (cf. Fillmore et al. [23], Goldberg 
[28]) that the results of generative grammar are easily integrated within a more 
ﬂexible conception that starts from the notion of construction without abolishing the 
difference between morphological and syntactic constructions. (Cf. Wildgen [76]: 
pp. 143–169 for an overview in German). 
6.6.1 
The Morphogenetic Foundation of “Deep” Structures 
The distinction between the deep form, the force (the “energeia”), and the static 
product was introduced in linguistics at the beginning of the nineteenth century 
by W. von Humboldt. Chomsky’s distinction between deep structure and surface 
structure, which he abandoned after 1968, was only a technical reﬂection of this 
theoretical distinction. It was René Thom ([61]: 121) who reminded us of the deeper 
motivation of this distinction: 
We, therefore, admit that the hypothesis of a ’deep structure’ of linguists consists essentially 
of our sensory representation of the external world (barely elaborated by perception). On the 
contrary, the surface structure will be constituted by automatisms of language themselves; 
they constitute a layer of spaces superﬁcially attached to the “deep structure”, and historically,

in evolution, they come from it by a process of permanent exfoliation, like our skin, made 
up of layers of cells secreted by the deep dermis and which go in the process of sclerosis 
towards the outside, where they disintegrate. (Translation by the author)21 
René Thom’s biological interpretation of Humboldt’s notion of “energeia” in 
grammar and the traditional notion of “deep” or crypto-structure in linguistics presup-
poses a very general concept of “morphology”, as Goethe coined it in his “Mor-
phologie überhaupt”. It links the biological forms in morphogenesis to symbolic 
forms, such as language. Thom [61] argued that linguistics is an exemplary morpho-
logical discipline. This means that the reference to biological morphogenesis is not 
just a superﬁcial analogy; morphological principles visible in biology are concen-
trated in symbolic forms, speciﬁcally in language. Linguistics is the prototype of 
morphology.22 
6.6.2 
Semantic Roles and the Dynamics of Sentential Frames 
The intuition that sentences and verbal phrases operate with a ﬁnite and small set 
of schemes or construction types goes back to antiquity. Wildgen ([68]: Chap. 2, 
pp. 9–58; in German) discussed this tradition up to modern case theories. The 
morphogenetic approach proposes a radically biological/cognitive analysis. It is 
founded in the publications of René Thom, who formulated the initial conjecture 
and elaborated in Wildgen ([69]; short English version in Wildgen [66]). A detailed 
analysis was published in Wildgen [72], in English, Chaps. 3 and 5) and in Wildgen 
([73]; in French, First Part: “La grammaire morphodynamique”). The account in the 
present book only considers the general lines and principles. Two assumptions are 
characteristic: 
• Semantic roles are primarily a cognitive classiﬁcation of processes (states) subject 
to verbalization. Therefore, their projection in a morphological and syntactic clas-
siﬁcation is polysemic and lacunar, i.e., the role must not be expressed in every 
context and can be left to the listener’s interpretation. 
• Semantic roles are variables and depend on the phenomenological level in which 
the process (see the list below) is rooted.
21 “Nous admettons donc que l’hypothétique d’une ’structure profonde’ des linguistes est constituée 
essentiellement de notre représentation sensorielle du monde extérieur (à peine élaborée par la 
perception). Au contraire, la structure de surface sera constituée par des automatismes du langage 
proprement dits; ils constituent une couche d’espaces accolés superﬁciellement à la “structure 
profonde”, et historiquement, dans l’évolution, ils en proviennent par un processus d’exfoliation 
permanente, à la manière de notre peau, constituée de couches de cellules secrétées par le derme 
profond et qui vont se sclérosant vers l’extérieur, où elles se désagrègent.” 
22 The relation between Goethe’s concept of “Morphologie überhaupt” and Thom’s morphogenetic 
access to language is discussed in Wildgen ([67]; in German).

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
We consider a hierarchy of levels centered on the individual speaker/hearer. The 
topological proximity to the ego (from the periphery to the center) motivates the 
following process levels (the stable state is considered the limiting case of a process): 
(a) 
Processes in the ambient space of the speaker/actor, 
• local processes; the processes take place in the sphere of the subject, for 
instance, bodily movements of the agent. 
• interlocal processes; the support of the process, for instance, a subject or an 
object changes his/its location. 
(b) Sensory processes: The center of the process is located in the (peripheral) 
apparatus of the senses. 
(c) 
Mental (self-referential) processes: The center is the brain (cortex). 
(d) Qualitative/quantitative changes: They are quasi-external to the individual but 
depend on quality dimensions and quantitative scales that the individual has 
internalized (often through language and cultural techniques). 
(e) 
Abstract changes: They constitute a heterogeneous class. Their meaning is 
vaguer, and the referential source remains opaque. 
The system of levels (a)–(e) can be represented as a system of containers (circles) 
around and inside the space centered on the Ego (Fig. 6.11).

The scene (the drama) described by a simple sentence (with a ﬁnite verb) is broken 
down into several regimes (sub-centers), which we call processual (semantic) roles. 
The verb represents the type of process. The classiﬁcation of possible scenes gives 
a system of representations we call imaginal (“imaginistic” according to Kosslyn 
[40]). They are neither images nor perceptual structures but cognitive entities at a 
syncretic level on which the grammatical morphogenesis can operate. 
The fundamental question that René Thom asked and to which he was able to give 
a surprising answer is the following: The scenes are continuous and contain an unlim-
ited number of variables that can inﬂuence what happens. Is there a possibility of 
ﬁnding a ﬁnite list of stable patterns to which all these variations can be reduced? His 
solution has been elaborated regarding linguistic facts and neuro-cognitive research; 
cf. for the ﬁrst direction Wildgen [66, 72, 81] and the second Petitot [49, 50]. 
As sketched in Thom [60], the morphology of sentential expressions points to 
morphogenesis rooted in fundamental biological and social behavior like grasp, 
predate, gift, and media of exchange (commercial and symbolic). Basic invariants 
of these processes are analog to a classiﬁcation of the stable unfolding of dynam-
ical systems in differential topology (speciﬁcally in the results of catastrophe theory, 
further elaborated in bifurcation analysis and chaos theory). The realization of these 
schemata in the grammars of current or historically documented grammars is poly-
semic and lacunar. Still, the empirical evidence supports Thom’s hypothesis (with 
a marge of statistical insecurity). As no better explanation is available (beyond a 
pure description of superﬁcial evidence), his proposals remain relevant until better, 
biologically rooted theories come to the fore. 
6.7 
Morphogenetic Patterns in the Syntax of Nouns 
and Adjectives 
The noun phrase is centered (usually) on a nominal nucleus (a noun) connected 
to a certain number of satellite words. According to Thom (1972), this connection 
is the product of a fundamental operation that appears in biological evolution and 
reappears in man’s cognitive development. We can consider four possible sources of 
this relationship: 
(1) Aristotle had already noticed that the hierarchy of the genera in biology 
corresponds to the lexical hierarchy of classiﬁcatory labels. The “species” is 
distinguished from the “genus proximum” by a “differentia speciﬁca”. 
Example: man (genus) is a social (speciﬁcation) animal (species). 
(2) The parts of the human body are cognized as a tree-like hierarchy (an acyclic 
graph). The different parts of the head can be hierarchized according to the way 
indicated in Fig. 6.12 (see Thom [63]: 187). Languages differ in the way they 
achieve the taxonomy of body parts.

Fig. 6.12 Tree-like hierarchy of body (head) parts in French (translated to English by the author) 
The denominations of body parts, as well as those of any other hierarchies like 
that of kinship terms, are called relational because they always imply a whole 
network or a local neighborhood of this network: 
• the forehead (of the skull), 
• the mother (of a child). 
The general idea that emerges from these systems is called: “diffusion de prég-
nance” (spread of relevance). If this diffusion is acyclic, it automatically leads 
to tree-like structures. 
(3) The meaning of an adjective or some specifying attribute of the noun can be a 
secondary index. Already in animals, such an indexical mark can be the trace, the 
excretum of the predator that is perceived in its absence. In this case, an alarm 
call negates the predator’s presence but tells its former (and possibly future) 
presence. In a nominal construction, the predator would be the noun, and the 
trace or excretum the attribute. In the context of religion, the attribute (epithet) is 
a sign for a god, for instance, thunder for the god Zeus. Thom ([63]: 28) argues 
that the trace is a typical morphogenetic source of attributes (epithets): In the 
case of a genitive construction in the noun phrase, it is derived from the noun 
by case marking. 
“The ‘genitive’, a syntactical form which indicates the proximity of a being 
but at the same time denies its immediate presence, may have appeared to resolve 
this dilemma; at the sight of a trace, one raised the cry of alarm but afﬁxing it 
with an afﬁx that negates the actual presence of the predator, allowing for a 
more graded form of defense strategies.”23 In more general terms, the adjective, 
attribute, or ad-nominal modiﬁer separates a qualiﬁcation from its source, the 
substratum, in the process of abstraction.
23 «Le ’génitif’, forme syntaxique qui indique la proximité d’un être mais en même temps nie sa 
présence immédiate, est peut-être apparu pour résoudre ce dilemme; à la vue d’une trace on a poussé 
le cri d’alarme mais en l’affectant d’un afﬁxe qui niait la présence effective du prédateur, ce qui 
permettait une forme plus graduée des stratégies de défense.»

(4) Children’s drawings show an association of parts in the ﬁgure that hardly respect 
correct geometric and metric relations (measures). In these drawings, it is natural 
to see a trace of the conceptual structure acquired by the child, where parts and 
aspects are separated and then loosely associated with the whole ﬁgure. For 
example, Thom writes ([64]:179): 
However, when we put a concept in the genitive, we dissociate it into its funda-
mental elements, […] that is to say, we highlight all the sub-concepts which intervene 
in the meaning, that is, the regulation of the mental ﬁgure of the concept: the tail of 
the dog, the wheel of the car, etc.24 
The different aspects mentioned by René Thom open the way to a (cognitive, even 
a biological) explanation of the adjective and the syntactic construction of nominal 
phrases. 
6.7.1 
The Positional Hierarchies of the Adjective and Its 
Semantic Values 
The analysis by Hansjakob Seiler [54] will be our starting point. Seiler’s model 
considers a continuum of determination with two extremes: 
• The speciﬁcations of the referential relation (extension). Typical realizations are 
deictic gestures and demonstratives. 
• Descriptive characterizations (intension). 
The German sentence (translated word by word) shows the typical syntactic 
organization: 
alle diese meine/erwähnten zehn schönen roten hölzernen Kugeln 
all-those-my/mentioned ten beautiful red wooden balls 
des Spiels auf dem Tisch, die ich dir jetzt gebe, ein Geschenk 
of the game on the table that I give you now as a gift …(apposition). 
The central noun is “Kugeln” (balls). It is preceded by two groups of determina-
tives (in the broad sense): 
(a) 
“alle diese meine”, 
(b) “erwähnten zehn schönen roten hölzernen”. 
Seiler calls the border between (a) and (b) the turning or inﬂection point. While 
in (a) the order is rigid, it is ﬂexible in (b) but governed by semantic laws. The 
order of epithetic adjectives responds to a criterion of speciﬁcity. Adjectives closer 
to the noun (relative to others) also have a more natural link to the center; they are
24 «Or, quand on met un concept au génitif, on le dissocie en ses éléments fondamentaux, […], c’est-
à-dire qu’on met en évidence l’ensemble des sous-concepts qui interviennent dans la signiﬁcation, 
c’est-à-dire la régulation de la ﬁgure mentale du concept: la queue du chien, la roue de la voiture 
etc.»”. 

174

The Morphogenesis of Language and Morphodynamic Grammar
more speciﬁc for that noun. In German, the order of categories corresponds to the 
following scale: 
numerals (1), evaluative adjectives (2), color adjectives (3), adjectives of 
substance (4), and noun nucleus (5) (cf. for details Wildgen, 1999: 211–214; in 
French). 
The descriptive space of noun and adjective phrases is characterized by its 
semantic or informational complexity; cf. [62]: 81). For example, the proper name 
“René Thom” is semantically more complex than the nouns “mathematician”, “pro-
fessor”, “French”, and “man” because by forgetting speciﬁc characteristics of the 
individual René Thom, we come to the mathematician, the professor, the French, 
and the man. The maximum value is given by a complete description that speciﬁes 
for all predicates whether the subject fulﬁlls them or not. Disjunctions (choices) 
instead of conjunctions diminish the informational value,ﬁnally, if none of the pred-
icates is ﬁxed in its truth value, the information is zero (cf. for the notion of semantic 
information Carnap and Har Hillel, 1952 and for its application Wildgen [77]. 
In general, it can be said that the noun phrase has its speciﬁc syntactic (morpho-
logical) and semantic laws. It refers to a semantic continuum with categorization 
(catastrophe) points, categorical focuses (attractors), and gradients on this continuum. 
6.7.2 
Sketch of the Morphogenetic Structure of Noun 
Phrases 
Suppose we start from a continuum on which regions are deﬁned around a focus (the 
categories of determinants and the nominal kernel). Then, we can choose a dynamical 
system with a dominant attractor and several attracting satellites as a basic model. 
Figure 6.13 shows us the graph of a potential function, and below, the Dynkin diagram 
retains only the critical points: maxima (–) and minima (+).
NN designates the noun category; typical members of this category are words that 
designate stable entities existing in the neighborhood of humans or their imagination 
rooted in this environment (for instance, discrete entities around the speaker). Mass 
nouns (water, milk, steam) and abstract nouns (whiteness, virtue, and happiness) 
are at a certain distance from the center of the prototype of the nominal category. 
We can predict that the satellites’ categorical weight (nominality) decreases with the 
distance from the central attractor. This distance from the prototype of the category 
noun (“nominality”) deﬁnes what we call the “categorical distance” in the noun 
phrase. 
Additionally, one has to consider a second dimension called information 
complexity. A third dimension is given by the context and the momentary state 
of the speaker and his interlocutor. In a nominal group, we can distinguish elements 
that refer to the situation from elements that contribute information. For example, 
the deictic determinatives (this, this one), pronouns (I, you, my, your), articles (one, 
the), and quantiﬁers (no, ﬁve, all) refer to the situation. On the other hand, adjectives,

6.7 Morphogenetic Patterns in the Syntax of Nouns and Adjectives
175
Fig. 6.13 Dynamic and discrete representation of a nominal kernel (NN) with its satellite concepts 
(Sat1, 2, 3)
nominal attributes, participles, and relative clauses contribute to the information in 
the nominal phrase, i.e., to the second dimension. Cf. Wildgen [77]: 218f) for more 
details on this spatial reconstruction of the semantics of noun phrases (in French). 
Nominal constructions must provide positions that ﬁll the dimension: information 
and contextual (indexical) rooting and provide enough distinctions. Languages differ 
in how they categorize this semantic space of noun phrases. What is universal is not a 
set of grammatical categories and subcategories but the space itself and the inherent 
dynamics of differentiation.25 
The morphogenetic model allows us to predict the most frequent types of differ-
entiation under the assumption that stable differentiations have maximally three or 
(under special conditions) four attractors (cf. the restrictions on valences treated in 
Sect. 6.6). Sequences on the same level can be iterated without theoretical limits but 
conﬁned by limits of memory or attention.26 
The construction of a low-dimensional semantic space is only a starting point. 
First, any theorization must pass through the stage of ideal construction. At this level, 
morphogenesis and possible biological or cognitive determinants may be treated. 
Beyond this basic level, the aleatory nature of symbolic systems (see the “arbitraire du
25 It was a ﬂaw of typological and comparative research in linguistics that it tried to use the traditional 
labels introduced in the grammar of classical Greek or Latin in the analysis of a corpus of different 
languages. Even if this list is enlarged or modiﬁed, the problem remains that a list choosing ad 
hoc between distinctions found in speciﬁc languages cannot be a general background of linguistic 
analysis. In any human language, the selection of “deep cases” and their expression results from an 
epigenetic process depending on the contingent, i.e., aleatory factors. 
26 Chomsky compared this iteration to complete algebraic induction and thus argued for an algebraic 
modelling in syntax. In reality, the phenomenon of recursiveness in natural languages is rather due to 
the lack of topological constraints. Semantically an inﬁnite series of attributes has a chaotic attractor; 
the meaning of the nominal construction is annihilated. Cf. my remarks on the accumulation of 
attributes in the characterization of God in Sect. 5.8.2.

signe” in de Saussure’s “sémiologie”) comes to the fore, and questions of explanatory 
relevance become opaque or even inaccessible. 
6.8 
Morphogenesis on Different Scales and the Stability 
of Language (and Other Symbolic Forms) 
The morphogenetic perspective on language described in this chapter has highlighted 
several layers of semiosis that must be considered. These results can be extrapolated 
to the morphogenesis of the symbolic forms analyzed in Chaps. 3, 4 and 5. Moreover, 
it seems necessary to get a picture of the relevance of morphogenesis for humans 
and human societies as wholes. The list of layers starts from the oldest ones, those 
that have governed the history of humankind for many millennia: 
(a) 
The emergence of a phonic language with a systematic impact on world knowl-
edge and practical control of the ambient sphere. This morphogenetic process 
has separated the human species (Homo sapiens) not only from its predeces-
sors, for instance, chimpanzees, the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and 
humans (LCA), but also from Homo erectus who expanded from Africa to 
many parts of the world, Homo heidelbergensis and ﬁnally from the subspecies 
of Neanderthals and Denisovans that have left a genetic trace in the genome of 
many human populations. It remains a controversial issue if the Neanderthals 
and the Denisovans had linguistic capacities comparable to those of ancient 
Homo sapiens or even to actual human populations. The morphogenesis of 
language has been modeled in this book using scenarios of (iterated) bifurca-
tion and (tentatively) the consideration of hypercycles in the sense of [22]. Such 
highly competitive and selective processes could explain this evolution’s speed 
and quasi-goal-directed nature. 
(b) Beyond the pure existence of a phonic language with the capacity to code refer-
ential meaning, the morphogenetic analysis of language must explain the orga-
nization of a rich lexicon and the emergence of techniques for the composition 
of meanings in morphology, syntax, and discourse, i.e., the richness of human 
languages in all known societies. Beyond a primitive lexicon (not far from 
lists of referential cues in animals, i.e., 10 to 100 items) and a “syntax” of 
juxtaposition comparable to two-word utterances in early childhood or primi-
tive (ad hoc) pidgins, we assumed a process of self-organization that reduces 
the insecurity/instability of a syntax of juxtaposition. The transition was only 
possible under the assumption of a precise and rapid production and memory of 
phonic patterns (syllables, words, phrases) and an efﬁcient reorganization of the 
growing lexicon that is analogous to human mental capacities of spatial control 
in locomotion, handling of objects, and fundamental interactions with other 
animate beings. The key to such semantics of phonic utterances is constructing 
a semantic space stabilized by its roots in a low-dimensional semantic space 
(basically three dimensions). The classiﬁcation theorem of catastrophe theory

6.8 Morphogenesis on Different Scales and the Stability of Language …
177
can explain the generality of such a restriction valid for simple structurally 
stable dynamical systems and their unfolding in time. The schematizations 
of processes, scenarios of events, and actions on this basis are restricted in 
the elementary case to three dimensions, and under special conditions to a 
fourth dimension. Beyond these limits, the stability of meaning constructions 
(semiosis) is endangered, and speciﬁc measures must be taken to avoid chaotic 
or even aleatory effects. The technique of such a reduction for the sake of 
stability can be observed in the analysis of case systems and similar syntactic 
devices (this generalization is caught under the term “deep cases” and was a 
central concern of grammars already in antiquity). In Sect. 6.6, some results in 
catastrophe theoretic semantics were summarized (avoiding the technicality of 
a formal model). 
(c) 
Schematizations in the lexicon of verbs (and other relational lexical items) 
and sentential constructions are the third manifestation of morphogenesis in 
language. They must have an image-like character (a quasi-spatiality). This 
means that scenarios of real life with a high degree of relevance (“prégnance” 
in terms of René [63] must be coded in every grammar of a human language 
such that despite the temporal/sequential mode of phonic language, a quasi-
spatial meaning can be recovered by the addressee of the utterance. This tech-
nique is the key to effective communication and opens the door for efﬁciency 
in everyday practices like language, art, music, religion, and other symbolic 
forms. The rich epistemic systems characteristic of human cultures in science 
and other symbolic systems enable humans to grasp, manage, and control their 
environment (including the personal and socio-political sphere). 
Chapters 3, 4 and 5 show that the symbolic forms of music, art, and religion 
responded to building highly organized spaces of meaning that allow for creativity 
and the establishment of prosperous and stable traditions. These are the necessary 
frames for communication and innovation, whereby the traditions are consistently 
adapted to changing conditions. Innovations may even enforce a radical change 
in the traditions, mainly if these are not appropriately adapted to new conditions. 
Beyond such a breaking of tradition, often accompanied by destructive decisions and 
social conﬂict, two basic demands must be fulﬁlled: First, an amount of successful 
understanding between community members must be guaranteed; second, a minimal 
level of reliability (“reality”) must be sustained. Human populations cannot survive 
in an illusionary or fake “reality”. 
Suppose we venture into a global (historical and geographical) perspective. In 
that case, we may consider the past of humanity and possibly its future as a morpho-
genetic process in which individual decisions, even those of leaders and people with 
a maximal concentration of inﬂuence and power, are not decisive (their effect is 
just a kind of small-scale variation). The history of humankind and even the time in 
which the earth is habitable are only insigniﬁcant spots in astrophysical processes. 
The maximal range of individual decisions does not exceed two or three generations; 
societies and empires may exist for centuries (the range of the Roman empire covers 
fewer than 2000 years). Ratiogenetic processes like human planning and politics

178

have a much shorter range. What remains relatively constant is the species that may 
stay more or less identical for 100,000 or even a million years. In the same period, 
innumerable other processes occur in parallel and dramatically change the conditions 
of survival and subsistence. 
In Chap. 5 on myth and religion, the visions of the end times and the apocalypse 
have been discussed. Currently, many intellectual activities concern the future of the 
climate on earth, the danger of global diseases, and possible scenarios of a third world 
war. However, such projections into the future of humanity and possible interventions 
to inﬂuence this evolution must consider the diversity of morphogenetic and self-
organizing processes beyond the inﬂuence of human agents. 
The symbolic forms considered in this book, i.e., music, art, religion, and language 
(possibly also further ones like ethics, technologies, and science), have a common 
feature: They have a kind of autonomy concerning physical, economic, and political 
controls. Moreover, they belong to the realm of common goods27 accessible to every-
body, like the air we respire, the water we drink, and the ground we are moving on. In 
this sense, they cannot be subdued to the interests of single persons or social groups. 
Therefore, a kind of natural evolution in concert with other natural processes cannot 
be suppressed or evinced. Consequently, the impact of human caprice or despotism 
is limited. However, this does not mean that natural processes secure the future of 
humanity. On the contrary, humanity may naturally disappear or destroy itself.

Peirce’s Semiotics, Cassirer’s Philosophy 
of Culture, and the Epistemology 
of Semiotics 
Abstract The analysis of symbolic forms asks for an epistemology tuned to its object 
and an ontological commitment that goes beyond a monist (physicalist) ontology or 
a dualist ontology, such as Descartes’ distinction between matter (“res extensa”) and 
mind (“res cogitans”). Peirce’s comment on Kepler and his scientiﬁc strategy gives a 
good starting point. The adequate ontology for semiotics (and symbolic forms) must 
distinguish three local ontologies and their relations: the world (W), the individual 
mind (I), and the community of communication (C). The relationships in this trian-
gular constellation deﬁne a network of information transfers and speciﬁc formats 
(propositional, spatial, or continuous). Peirce’s central notion of “interpretant” is 
elaborated in this context. 
7.1 
Introduction 
The post-medieval view was that the space of allowed thinking, imagination, and 
innovation is strictly conﬁned and has to respect some standard interpretation of the 
Holy Scriptures (under the authority of some acknowledged institution). For Galilee 
and Kepler, the new heliocentric model was mainly a technical (mathematical) inno-
vation, but, in reality, it triggered a series of intellectual revolutions.1 Renaissance 
philosophy opened the ﬁeld of philosophical and cosmological consciousness beyond 
medieval restrictions. Giordano Bruno’s model of an inﬁnite space of worlds (solar 
systems) and human conceptualization and memory opened the doorway to European 
Enlightenment and modern science in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (cf. 
Wildgen [30, 34] for “cosmological memory” in Giordano Bruno’s opus in Latin). 
The eighteenth century made a big step in introducing the anthropological dimen-
sion of language and thinking,it was the starting point of all modern explanations of
1 They thought it would not provoke any conﬂict with the religious creed. One had only to accept 
minor modiﬁcations related to marginal passages in the Scriptures. However, Giordano Bruno had 
already grasped the provocative power of the Copernican worldview in 1584; cf. Widlgen [33].

the origin of human language and human cognition (even before Darwin explained 
evolution in 1859; cf. the writings of Condillac, Maupertuis, Rousseau, Diderot and 
Herder after 1746). 
However, the inﬁniteness of the space of consciousness does not mean that in 
a speciﬁc moment, for speciﬁc operations, the human mind is without constraints, 
that the transition of frontiers is easy, or that the operations of the human intellect 
are arbitrary. As in Bruno’s cosmology, every single world in the universe is ﬁnite, 
and most events happen in this ﬁnite frame. These ﬁnite, local frames are inﬁnitely 
embedded in larger frames, and humans can conceive no absolute frame. 
Bruno’s assumption that all other solar systems were identical to the system where 
we live was too optimistic. Our solar system at the rim of our galaxy is unique, and the 
constellation of the moon and earth as a tandem may be exceptional. Nevertheless, 
if the universe is inﬁnite, there should be other solar systems similar to ours, and it is 
highly probable that they have developed or will develop intelligent beings. In this 
very general sense, symbolic forms have a cosmological frame that surfaces in the 
symbolic form of myth and religion discussed in Chap. 5. The most pertinent local 
frame is the ambient ecology of humans. In many animals, this frame is severely 
restricted. Evolutionary changes in the climate and the surrounding ecology can 
radically change this frame. Human evolution was and still is dependent on such 
changes. The human species can even transform the frame of its survival through 
its growth and the industrial exploitation of the ambient ecology. The concept of 
“Anthropocene” points to this aspect. 
The human mind and its media of communication can transgress given frames. In 
a larger sense, this was also true for humankind on its path from biological to cultural 
evolution, a story of frame changes and extensions. Therefore, different (genetically 
or culturally given) frames constitute human consciousness. In the following section, 
three outstanding frames (called “ontologies”) are distinguished: (1) A cosmolog-
ical frame that, for practical purposes of human communication, can be focused 
on our world, the earth, and the spatiotemporal surroundings of humans. (2) The 
human body (the mind and all body parts) is relevant for human communication 
(active and receptive). (3) Insofar as humans are “social animals” (cf. Aristotle’s 
“zoon politicon”; class. greek: ζùoν πoλιτικ´oν), all social entities beginning with 
the mother–child-group are relevant frames of human communication and symbolic 
forms. As in other classiﬁcation cases, we suppose an underlying continuum, and 
thus an inﬁnity of possible frames. It is a question of parsimony to assume a ﬁnite 
and small number. The notions of sign in antiquity, in Augustine, the middle ages, 
and most modern theories of the sign (e.g., the tripartite distinction by Peirce) and 
the shortcomings of reductionist theories that eliminate either the ﬁrst frame (the 
world and the reference to it) or the social dimension (e.g., cognitivist models) or 
reduce the body (frame 2) to the brain are arguments for such a tripartite ontological 
framework.2 
2 The term ontology does not presuppose a metaphysical assumption about the universe’s structure. 
Every ontological frame is a practical postulate that helps to organize our understanding of basic 
processes in perception, cognition, knowledge, and social action. In this chapter, the term “semi-
otics” includes the domain called “philosophy of symbolic forms” by Cassirer [5]. Symbolic forms

7.2 
Science in the Spirit of Kepler and Peirce and Semiotics 
In his “Lessons on the History of Science”, given in the context of Lowell Lectures 
in 1892, Peirce characterized Kepler’s intellectual strategy: 
His admirable method of thinking consisted in forming in his mind a diagrammatic or 
outline representation of the entangled state of things before him, omitting all that was 
accidental, observing suggestive relations between the parts of his diagram, performing 
diverse experiments upon it, or upon the natural objects and noting the results. 
The ﬁrst quality required for this process, the ﬁrst element of high reasoning power, is 
imagination; and Kepler’s fecund imagination strikes every reader. But “imagination” is an 
ocean-wide term, almost meaningless; so many and so diverse are its species. What kind of 
imagination is required to form a mental diagram of a complicated state of affairs? Not that 
poet-imagination that “bodies forth the forms of things unknown”,3 but a devil’s imagination 
quick to take Dame Nature’s hints. The poet-imagination riots in ornaments and accessories, 
a Kepler’s makes the clothing and the ﬂesh drop off, and the apparition of the naked skeleton 
of truth to stand revealed before him (Peirce [21]: 255). 
In his analysis of the trajectory of the planet mars around the sun, Kepler had to 
imagine possible mathematical laws that correspond to the data Tycho Brake had 
collected until he died (cf. [14]). Currently, mathematicians and physicists develop 
devices called “The machine mathematician” that rehearse the work done by Kepler, 
i.e., they extract equations from a large set of data. The ﬁrst algorithm, called BACON, 
was able to “ﬁnd” the Kepler laws in astronomy. An advanced algorithm is called 
“Symbolic Regression”. Kepler’s “imagination” is simulated by considering a large 
set of possible mathematical formulas, searching in different directions, and using a 
kind of Darwinian competition between different routes.4 Applied to semiotics, the 
tradition of Eco, Greimas, and others restricts a priori the choice of mathematical 
tools to simple logical patterns (cf. the dominance of binary oppositions and the 
universal use of the “semiotic square” by Greimas and his followers). In practice, 
they adhere rigidly to these simple devices and arrange or interpret the data available 
such that a plausible account may be reached.5 
Peirce’s observations on Kepler foreshadow the history of semiotics in the twen-
tieth century. Some of Saussure’s followers in France in the sixties developed a 
literary style of structural semiotics, which was quickly absorbed into studies of mass 
media, journalism, and modern media sciences. Umberto Eco (1932–2016) was the
are signs in the sense of Peirce. In addition to Peirce, the arts, music, myth, and religion are dealt 
with on par with language and scientiﬁc communication. Semiotics is more than a generalized logic 
or linguistics.

poet’s pen // Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing // A local habitation and a name”.

4 Cf. recent advances in “machine imagination”. Thus Li, Ji, and Zhang [16] use Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence to describe the scientiﬁc itinerary from Kepler to Newton. 
5 The source of this attitude was probably the success of Chomsky [6] and his restriction of the rules 
of grammar to set theoretical notions and the hierarchy of rewrite rules in the so-called Chomsky 
hierarchy.

Peirce’s Semiotics, Cassirer’s Philosophy of Culture …
most prominent author in this ﬁeld. He was the director of the Bologna center of 
mass media and a successful author of novels. He stood ﬁrmly on the ground of a 
philosophical-literary culture in Romance countries but sought theoretical backing 
in the Danish school of structuralisms (mainly Hjelmslev). In the last decades of 
the twentieth century, Eco took notice of American cognitivism, mainly cognitive 
semantics. In these developments, semiotics became a Janus-headed discipline. In 
its practices and mainly in its teaching in Europe and Latin America, semiotics in 
the spirit of structuralism (Eco, Greimas, and followers) stuck to the literary and 
philological traditions and avoided the difﬁculties of formal reasoning and strict 
methodologies in empirical research. In theory, it had the ambition to cope with 
modern interdisciplinary science but could not go beyond theoretical eclecticism. 
Coming back to Peirce and Kepler, this major trend of semiotics opted for a poet’s 
style of “scientiﬁc” imagination and against the “devil’s imagination quick to take 
Dame Nature’s hints” (cf. the quotation from Peirce above). Semiotics should instead 
pursue the “devil’s method” using advanced conceptual tools in modern mathematics, 
e.g., dynamical system theory. Insofar as these tools have been developed and applied 
in the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, cognitive sciences), semiotics in 
this style can be called “semiophysics” (cf Thom [25]). In the following, the focus 
will be on the epistemology of such an enterprise. 
In the humanities and speciﬁcally semiotics, this endeavor should reﬂect on 
a proper ontology, i.e., the fundamental assumptions or foundational concepts 
supporting the theoretical construction. One needs three ontological premises: the 
world we experience (W), the individual sensitive and cognitive system (I), and a 
community/culture/society (C) as the place of coordination,6 shared knowledge, and 
tradition. 
7.3 
The Threefold Ontology of the World (W), 
the Individual Mind (I), and the Community 
of Humans (C) 
A central question in semiotic studies is: Can humans know the world, themselves 
(their minds, indirectly other humans and their minds), or at least have an approximate 
idea about these matters? Two basic approaches to knowledge can be distinguished: 
via the world or self-experience (reﬂection). Both approaches must be brought to a 
synthesis in the individual mind and shared with a community, which is the locus of 
selection, stabilization, and objectiﬁcation of individual insights, and thus the deci-
sive factor in gaining relevant and persistent knowledge. The relationship between
6 The phenomena of coordination in inanimate and animate dynamic systems are the central topic 
of “Synergetics”, developed by Hermann Haken, Scott Kelso, and others, cf. [10] and  [15]. These 
models and mathematical treatments are always the background when in the following chapters, 
coordination is put to the fore. 

7.3 The Threefold Ontology of the World (W), the Individual Mind (I) …
187
the individual mind and the collective “mind” is the bottleneck of objective knowl-
edge. Many proposals for the solution to this problem have been made in the history 
of epistemology. 
A one-sided emphasis on the collective aspects considers knowledge exclusively 
from the perspective of academic institutions (schools, universities, research insti-
tutions, and accepted traditions).7 It reduces the problem to the formal and political 
organization of the communities, ignoring individuals’ experience, curiosity, and 
intuition.8 Individual thinkers do not only commit themselves to an intellectual direc-
tion; they contribute to it, carry it and ﬁll it with life, starting from their personal expe-
rience. Intuition, experience, and reﬂection, however, seem to be not communicable 
because they presuppose some comparative instance (a “tertium comparationis”) that 
can catalyze personal experiences. Nevertheless, similar individual concepts can be 
matched using identity-preserving transformations (automorphism).9 The individual 
thinkers must compare their experience and reﬂective insight with the experience of 
others (i.e., they should achieve a third-person perspective) and eventually transform 
it into a general system of signs, such as linguistic, visual, technical, or other signs. 
On this collective level, the others can then understand the personal insight of an 
individual. 
All three entities, the world (W)–the individual (I)–the community (C), are in 
motion, changing continuously. The individual (I) experiences and constructs the 
world (W) in thought. The world, including that of others, who belong to the self’s 
environment, is resistant, i.e., the construction of the world by the individual is 
evaluated, shaped, and reshaped through interaction with the world and others in 
everyday actions. While the individual perceives the others who also interact with 
the world, he participates in their world construction, at least under essential aspects, 
and coordinates his world perception with that of the others. This selective partic-
ipation only affects those aspects relevant to the communal experience. There are, 
for this reason, many individually different world constructs, which, however, are 
“heat-sealed” at the seams of collective interest, at the points of coordination. The 
constellation of three correlated ontologies forms a very complex system. In mathe-
matical terms, specially developed for astrophysics, it is comparable to a three-body
7 Non-human collectivities, i.e., cooperating social animals and integrated assemblies of plants or 
other biotic entities, show similar features. The morpho-dynamic models of Thom/Zeeman and the 
synergetic models of Haken/Kelso have the advantage that the concepts they apply do not presuppose 
human conscience and free will. 
8 In the case of individual animals or even plants, similar arguments can be formulated. Thus, 
Darwinian selection operates basically on the level of individuals who survive or procreate. 
9 Automorphism is “mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure” (Wikipedia). In 
color perception and color labeling by individuals, a color space is deﬁned with a speciﬁc topology 
and relations of isotopy. Kleiner [13]: 20 writes: “Putting everything together, we conclude that 
any statement, scientiﬁc or otherwise, that addresses color experiences sensu stricto—i.e. which 
addresses what it is like to experience colors—only makes sense if it is invariant with respect to 
Iso(E) [equivalence preserving; W.W.] transformations. This is a consequence of the fact that qualia 
are non-collatable and of the corresponding freedom of every experiencing subject to choose names 
for the qualia he/she experiences.”

Fig. 7.1 Orbits of a planet in a binary star system 
problem. How can the three movements, the world, the individuals, and the commu-
nity, be combined to form a stable or at least metastable overall system? Poincaré has 
already shown that the three-body problem can only be solved in exceptional cases. 
In general, it shows chaotic dynamics (see Montgomery [19]). We cannot elaborate 
on this analogy and possible mathematical models in this context. After all, it shows 
that a seemingly simple conﬁguration of three force ﬁelds leads to an almost uncon-
trollable dynamic. The two-body problem in one dimension can have the character of 
a linear interaction between two billiard balls that collide. In two dimensions, either 
two bodies of similar size orbit a center (e.g., in a binary star system), or a smaller 
body (a planet) orbits the larger one (e.g., the sun). Li and Liao [18] simulated the 
problem and possible solutions,they found 695 examples of coordinated movement 
of three bodies with equal mass. In any model of this interaction, it is crucial either 
to reduce the three-body problem in a rough approximation to a two-body problem 
or to consider particular constellations in which the movement pattern of the three 
bodies (centers of force) is periodic or almost periodic and thus describable (under-
standable).10 Figure 7.1 shows “some of the possible repetitive orbits of an idealized 
planet moving in the plane of a pair of stars that are in a perfect elliptical orbit” 
(Wolfram notices, page 972: https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-4-three-
body-problem/. 
A minimal scenario of insight and processing in cognition (perceiving, feeling, 
categorizing, or evaluating) has the following components: 
1. A human environment is recognizable by the available sensory apparatus and 
cognitive centers. We call it the world (W). Under the condition of sensory 
and cognitive accessibility, this world is different for each living species and 
varies (less dramatically) between the individuals of a species. Thus, there is 
also a reality beyond this world accessible to our species. Man has succeeded in 
expanding the area of his insight and knowledge again and again; nevertheless, 
the world (W) remains fundamentally different from reality (the thing-in-itself, 
according to Kant). The human environment naturally includes living beings, 
especially other people. With these, mainly if they use the same system of signs, 
the individuals can exchange ideas about their world knowledge. Knowledge of
10 The dyadic conception of signs by Ferdinand de Saussure reduces the traditional sign triad (St. 
Augustine) to the duality of”signiﬁcant = image acoustique” versus “signiﬁé = image mentale”. 
Thus, it simpliﬁes the three-forces-constellation to a two-forces-constellation which is not in the 
neighborhood of chaos. Concerning state-of-the-art in 1900, this was a promising scientiﬁc strategy. 

7.3 The Threefold Ontology of the World (W), the Individual Mind (I) …
189
the world is, thus, to a certain extent (not generally), dependent on the shared 
system of signs. This part of the world (W) forms the reference for the use of 
signs and, thus, the necessary point of departure for every semiosis. 
2. Although human individuals and sign users have genus-speciﬁc biological prop-
erties, they are individually different. Moreover, their “world” is developed differ-
ently due to speciﬁc living and learning conditions. Nevertheless, individuals are 
the actual place of perception, cognition, and communication, so we must use 
them as fundamental centers of force in our dynamic modeling. We symbolize 
this center with the individual (I); the number of individuals can be huge (up to 
the number of people living in this world). These individual worldviews can be 
the reference domain of signs in communication; i.e., individual worldviews or 
perspectives can be and often are the proper reference basis for signs. In many 
languages, the traces of this ontology are constructions containing “propositional 
attitudes” like “I think, I believe, I doubt that”.11 
3. Communication and the use of signs always involve several individuals, i.e., a 
model that only has the individual and the world as a reference is fundamentally 
inadequate. The network of individuals has a rich structure because there are many 
individuals and many kinds of intersubjective or communicative relationships. 
From the point of view of the individual, these networks also appear differently. 
Besides, there are global structures in society that are no longer transparent from 
the individual’s perspective and thus only rarely inﬂuence his behavior or do this 
only in extreme situations. The social environment (“society”) is a sine qua non 
of all communication and the use of symbols. In this respect, although it appears 
abstract and opaque from the individual’s perspective, it must be recognized as 
a primary force, i.e., as an anchor point of the semiotic model. In particular, 
systems of behavioral norms, conventions for the use of signs, traditions, and 
their validity beyond the lifespan of individuals cannot be explained without 
accepting this ontology. This necessity is particularly true of symbolic forms (in 
the sense of Cassirer). We symbolize this component as a society or community 
(C). 
As the above comments have already shown, the three forces depend on one 
another; one can call the dependencies force ﬁelds and consider the topology and 
dynamics of such a ﬁeld. The force ﬁelds that connect them are to be interpreted 
in the simplest case as an attraction (positive) or repulsion (negative). This analysis 
results in a plausible analogy to physical facts and furnishes the motivation to use 
the corresponding conceptual techniques in semiotics.12 
In the triple constellation presented, the world is by far the most potent compo-
nent in that it enables both the evolution and the continued existence of individuals
11 In the case of language, this is evident for speech acts, modalities, and propositional attitudes. 
In visual art and music, neglect of this dimension would make these symbolic forms trivial and 
lacking in content. 
12 This decision is in no way a physicalist reduction because the conceptual tools used in the natural 
sciences are symbolic forms speciﬁcally tailored in the context of physics, chemistry, and the life 
sciences.

and the constitution of society. Compared to the changes in the individual (I) and 
society (C), the world (W) is relatively constant, i.e., it changes more slowly, and 
the inﬂuence of (I) and (C) on (W) is relatively small. This is because individuals 
and societies are parts of the world, just as individuals are parts of society. However, 
there is another hierarchy relative to (I) and (C). The individuals (I) are biological-
evolutionary entities, and the societies (C) are either organized in the individuals’ 
mental representations or indirectly in the artifacts such as settlements, trafﬁc routes, 
architecture, laws, norms, etc. Therefore, they are dependent, secondary entities that 
have been consolidated or gained power in the course of history. 
In the context of the analogy mentioned above between the astrophysical system 
and the communication system, the world (W) plays the role of the sun, and the 
individuals (I) are satellites of the sun like the earth or other planets. The societies 
are like a planet’s moons (cf. Fig. 7.2). This planetary image is, however, only a 
mnemonic crib that may help to illustrate the network of dynamic relations between 
the three frames and to serve as the base for the use of a semiotic concept of force, 
force ﬁeld in this network. Further research must show how far this metaphor can 
lead us. Less metaphorically, we can state: (W) is the base of all sign objects, (I) is 
the realm of secondary, and (C) is the realm of tertiary sign objects.

Cycles and Hypercycles in Semiogenesis 
Based on the Kepler ontology sketched earlier, we can use a metaphorical link 
between the realm of astronomy (Kepler’s primary area of intellectual engagement) 
and the threefold ontology of semiosis. This metaphor may seem farfetched, but it 
allows for a simpliﬁcation and systematic conception of the rich relational networks 
inside the threefold universe of symbolic forms (signs in terms of Peirce). 
The basic metaphorical equation is planetary center/orbits ≈domains of semiosis. 
On the side of the planetary system, three agents (force ﬁelds) are distinguished: The 
sun has a gravitational force that governs the orbit of the planets; it illuminates them 
and provides them with energy (of radiation). The earth is in motion around the sun 
and follows speciﬁc laws of motion (Kepler’s laws); it holds the moon in its orbit and 
is illuminated by the moon at night. Finally, the moon has a ﬁxed orbit and governs 
the dynamics of the tides (and other processes) on the earth. In the semiotic and 
epistemic universe, we can distinguish similar cyclic processes: 
1. The evolutionary (Darwinian) cycle governs the evolution of life and the tree of 
species. Singularities like the impact of planetary bodies on the earth, physical 
catastrophes like volcano eruptions, and climatic crises play a prominent role. 
Our species, the Homo sapiens, is a late product of this evolutionary cycle. 
The driving force is the confrontation with the world (W), i.e., selection on the 
background of mutations (genetic “noise”). 
2. The individual mind is, together with the whole body, a product of the ﬁrst 
cycle. In the biography, learning, and other adaptation cycles, the individual (I) 
achieves a level of knowledge and conscience, including symbolic forms. This 
development is cyclic insofar as signiﬁcant experiences are repeated over and over 
again and create a system of knowledge, which serves as a stable background for 
cognitive patterns (cf. Chap. 6). The driving forces are experience and knowledge. 
They are constitutive of the individual mind (M). 
3. The collective “mind”, i.e., the selection and accumulation of the experiences and 
memories of many individuals in a community, is insofar cyclic as each social 
contact; each exchange of experience or memories and knowledge contributes 
to a cycle of selection (reduction) and synthesis (augmentation) in an inﬁnite 
process. These processes constitute the community/culture/society (C). 
Together, the three cycles form a hypercycle in the sense of Eigen and Schuster 
[8]. They have elaborated this notion in the context of a model that should explain the 
origin of life. In Wildgen [31], it was adapted to explain the origin of language. Hyper-
cycles are rapid morphogenetic processes in biochemical, biological, and symbolic 
systems. In Sect. 6.1.3, the hypercycle concept has been applied to understand the 
rapid evolution of human language capacity.

The Dynamics of Information in the Threefold 
Ontology: World—Individual—Community 
The informational attraction between the three centers (W), (I), and (C) is based on the 
interplay of salience and pregnancy fundamental for the human cognitive apparatus 
(cf. Thom [25]; Wildgen [32], and Sect. 1.4 in this book). Salience concerns the 
perceptual apparatus’s selection of external impressions (stimuli). They are either 
ignored if the perception window does not capture them, accepted if the perception 
threshold is crossed, or reinforced if the stimulus optimally ﬁts the physiological 
ﬁlter. Vital relevance or “pregnancy” (“prégnance” in Thom [25]) has its source in 
the vital needs of the individual. Perceived impressions are rated either as particularly 
relevant or as meaningless. As the product of these two instances, a speciﬁc effect 
emerges, leading to action or enabling a stronger or weaker memory entry. The overall 
effect can be called semantic information.13 The individuals (I) obtain information 
from the world (W) and exchange it selectively with one another, with the help of 
a medium, e.g., an acoustic, a visual, or another symbolic system. A selection can 
inform the community (C), which stands, therefore, indirectly in a relationship of 
information to the world. 
The informational attraction of individuals by the world is the strongest force 
because incorrect perceptions and evaluations negatively affect individuals. In 
contrast, successful information transfers are associated with positive effects. 
Overall, a chain of reinforcements and hindrances emerges and forms a proﬁle of 
the world for the individuals (compare the concept of “affordance” in ecological 
psychology; e.g., Gibson [9]). Every exchange between individuals already consti-
tutes a social reference, i.e., the starting point of society. Society emerges in a syner-
getic process in which individuals are differently involved. The process is very selec-
tive, i.e., only highly rated facts about the world are used in forming opinions and 
decision-making in society. Indirectly (see the perforated arrow), a phenomenon 
arises that Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) called a “worldview”. 
In the case of myth/religion, global ideology, and general scientiﬁc models (e.g., 
the big bang model of astrophysics), the following features are noticeable and differ 
from everyday communication: 
(a) 
The salience of features that go beyond, i.e., “transcend” everyday experience 
(e.g., theoretical entities in physics, ethical or religious principles, social utopias) 
can be minimal or even zero since there is no conﬁrmation of these transcen-
dent entities in sensory experience. The pregnancy, i.e., the expected value for 
knowledge or human consciousness, is, in many cases, high. Even (imagined) 
traces of a sensory salience can sufﬁce to form stable signs and sign systems.
13 Cf. Carnap and Bar-Hillel [3] for the notion of “semantic information” and its application to 
semantics (and sociolinguistics) in Wildgen [26]. 

7.5 The Dynamics of Information in the Threefold Ontology …
193
In this context, information can emerge from (almost) nothing, i.e., imagined 
facts are assigned a quasi-sensory salience.14 
(b) Selection and reinforcement in the transition from individuals to society are 
decisive for accepting general principles in science, religion, or ethics. The social 
coordination of opinions and evaluations transforms weak individual causal 
attributions into ﬁrm convictions and normative articles of faith. At the same 
time, these constructs are the skeleton for stable social rules and norms.15 
(c) 
The indirect relation to the world in the case of societies can lead, among other 
things, to the fact that some properties of the directly perceptible and assessable 
world that are relevant for survival or well-being are ignored. A society can 
existentially fail, caused by its generated ideological or religious phantasms. 
It can destroy itself or lose strength and the courage to survive in competition 
with other societies. However, the opposite can also occur, for example, if the 
state of the world is highly discouraging and resignation and fatalism spread. 
As a remedy, an optimistic, religiously, or ideologically motivated, although 
unrealistic, view of the world can help through the time of need and avert a 
downfall. Cf. for the dynamics of myth and religion Chap. 5 and Wildgen ([36], 
in German). 
The fundamental instability of the three-body constellation has immediate 
consequences for the stability of symbolic forms. Speciﬁc solutions, i.e., at least 
temporarily stable scenarios, will either reduce the number of relevant force-centers 
and result in a stable two-body constellation or reduce the information exchange 
to a partial and limited exchange between two or three of the bodies. The second 
solution corresponds in the astronomical context to the rigid relation between the 
moon and the earth, insofar as the change and development of a society are restricted 
in comparison with individuals, similarly as the moon’s orbit is restricted insofar as 
it always shows the same side to the earth.16 
In the case of religions, ideologies, and other global systems of belief, three 
scenarios may be considered (along with many others imaginable): 
• Every individual tries to make sense of the world he/she perceives, experiences, 
and in which he/she acts. Shared knowledge and faith tend to disappear under the 
condition of individual fragmentation. This situation corresponds to an “anomic 
community” in the sense of Durkheim [7]. If one looks at the distribution of 
knowledge and opinions in communities, one can observe a natural tendency
14 In mystical empathy, sensations can be generated that are very intense. In some cases, they can 
even have dramatic physiological consequences, such as the opening of wounds on the hands and 
feet in the imagination of the sufferings of Christ. 
15 The religious "information" is objectiﬁed in material forms, which can become the object of 
salient and pregnant perceptions and thus create a second-order relationship to the world. In addi-
tion, through artifacts such as images, sculptures, religious rituals, or texts, religious belief can 
be experienced with the senses. However, these secondary realities may lead to the prohibition of 
sculptures, images, and names (cf. Wildgen [36], Part II). 
16 Galilei showed that the earth and other planets (in his case Jupiter) have a moon or several moons. 
Meanwhile, astronomers found many planets and their moons outside our solar system.

toward individualized and context-relative knowledge and belief. The dynamics 
of individual variation are never absent but just concealed by the prominence of 
institutionalized norms. 
• The impact caused by the individual is reduced or eliminated. Totalitarian ideolo-
gies and societies tried to achieve this goal. In periods of conﬂict, war, or global 
repression, such a “solution” may be preserved even for some decades. The 
Spanish Inquisition (main period 1500–1700) and the quasi-monarchism of the 
pope in the context of the 1870 dogma of infallibility tried to focus religious 
authority on one institution or its highest representative. More recent examples 
are Stalin’s Russia between 1927 and 1953 and Hitler’s Germany between 1933 
and 1945. Modern neo-Islamic “Jihad”, i.e., a war against all non-Islamic reli-
gions and populations, tries to eliminate any information exchange between the 
different religions. It hinders the information exchange with individuals that do not 
belong to the same community. As intellectual and also commercial information 
exchange is the motor of any successful governance in the globalized world, such 
a strategy cannot contribute to the welfare of the members of these societies, and 
as soon as war-like situations disappear and mass murder loses its acceptability, 
such “solutions” will also lose their attractiveness. 
• The most radical reduction annihilates the role of the world; insofar as it does 
not ﬁt a given grid, a ﬁxed worldview. In the modern technological world, this 
attitude is only possible if the area of technology and underlying natural sciences 
is exempted from such blindness. Modern warfare depends essentially on tech-
nology, which leads to a strict separation of technical and military information 
from social or political information. The ﬁrst is considered highly relevant to 
society and its leaders. All kinds of knowledge, which on one side are not relevant 
for warfare or even dangerous for the “frozen” ideology, are repressed or frozen 
in an earlier standard.17 Philosophy, ethics, sociology, psychology, and commu-
nication sciences are reduced to interpreting religious or ideological texts. In the 
context of Christian denominations, the Copernican hypothesis, the philosophy 
of “free” thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the Darwinian 
hypotheses were excluded from any information transfer in speciﬁc communities. 
As interdictions had no immediate impact on current economic and social life, 
they could be sustained for long periods. Eventually, they endanger the coherence 
of general education and the growth of scientiﬁc knowledge and produce a kind 
of “backwardness” with negative economic and political consequences.
17 George Orwell describes the role of knowledge versus ignorance in societies preceding the 
utopian society described in his book “1984” as follows: “In the past, also, war was one of the main 
instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages 
have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to 
encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efﬁciency. […] In philosophy or religion, or 
ethics, or politics, two and two might make ﬁve, but when one was designing a gun or an airplane 
they had to make four. […] War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were 
concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards.” (Orwell [20]: 206). In Orwell’s 
dystopia, even wars are arbitrary ﬁctions, such that the poor remains of sanity are abolished.

The Information Flow Between the Forces: World, 
Individual, and Community 
In Fig. 7.2, the arrows joining the three bodies were titled “information” and “infor-
mational attraction”. The notion of “semantic information” of Carnap and Bar Hillel 
[3] supposes a world represented by logical propositions. In such a logical space of 
possible states of affairs, information is the measure of restriction to subsets of states. 
The information increases with the amount of restriction. It is zero (0) if all possible 
states remain possible (are not reduced) and (1) if only one state is left, i.e., if the 
state of the universe is ﬁnally speciﬁed. This concept of information is rudimentary 
and abstract. Therefore, it is clear that the three bodies considered, the world, the 
individuals, and the society, ask for different information codes in the constitution of 
a space representing their state of affairs. In the following, (I) shall sketch the nature 
of such universes of information and their interaction: 
• A society with its norms, rules, commands, and interdictions easily ﬁts into 
the propositional logic framework. For illustration, we may consider the list of 
commands and interdictions in Judaic rules of Shabbat and food prescriptions. 
There exists a ﬁnite list of propositions describing the content of commands (you 
should follow p) and interdictions (negative command: you should not follow 
p). If all commands and interdictions are followed, the believers are in perfect 
concert with their society (their religious community) and obtain the maximal 
information value (1). On the other hand, if they break all interdictions and do 
not follow any of the commands, they reach the information value of zero. This 
propositional model of the universe of information can be adapted to any religion 
or law-governed social system. Suppose this type of information is projected on 
the world (W). In that case, one can imagine a world of perfect obedience to the 
religious (social) rules, i.e., heaven, and a world of total disobedience, i.e., hell. 
The quasi-logical structure of these religious concepts is probably not natural or 
primal for religious thought but rather a product of logo-centric reconstructions 
following the elaboration of rhetorical and argumentative schemes developed in 
literate antique societies, i.e., after 3000 BC18 Cf. Chap. 5 and Wildgen [36]: 
140–179) for more details. 
• Information ﬂows in the individual mind were recently (mainly in the second 
half of the twentieth century) approximated by the consideration of “logical” 
machines, i.e., computers, that, on their part, are based on logical calculus. Since 
the end of the twentieth century, it became evident that the “machine in the 
wet”, i.e., the brain, follows different principles. PDP models (PDP = parallel 
distributed processes), neural networks, neuro-computers, and integrated infor-
mation theory (IIT) looked for alternative concepts. The fact that language plays 
such a dominant role in human thinking suggests that speciﬁc (logo-centric)
18 The oldest cuneiform and hieroglyphic scripts are dated to 3400 and 3200 B.C. However, their 
religious impact may have occurred later in the context of mythical narratives’ ﬁxation and ritual 
instauration. 

196

Peirce’s Semiotics, Cassirer’s Philosophy of Culture …
aspects of human thinking can be translated into a propositional format. But what 
about human neural procedures of imagination and thinking, spatial-dynamical, 
and continuous-ﬂuid aspects (cf. emotion and evaluation)? Are they lost in the 
information exchange between individuals and their society? If this is the case, 
do individuals accept this dramatic loss? A signiﬁcant problem exists already 
at the micro-social level. If two persons, e.g., a couple, exchange information, 
are the spatial-dynamical and the continuous-ﬂuid aspects of information lost? 
Probably not. However, if this is so, one can conclude that, at least in perspec-
tive, these aspects can also be transferred ﬁrst to the family, the group of friends, 
the networks of regular social contacts, etc. With social distance, the loss of a 
shared spatial–temporal reference base, and the insecurity of transmissions of 
analog contents, the information ﬂow may be biased toward the more rigid, two-
valued propositional schemes. Consequently, such global communities lose their 
human relevance or even become anti-human. We can conclude that the concept 
of semantic information based on propositional logic is at least partially inade-
quate and must be enriched by non-propositional concepts of information and 
information transfer based on continuous scales (analogous information) and 
spatiotemporal information (theoretically assessed in dynamic systems theory). 
• The problem of information ﬂow becomes even more dramatic if we consider the 
ﬂow between the world as we perceive and experience it and the individuals. The 
history of the natural sciences illustrates this problem alongside possible routes 
to its solution. Galilei said that scientists should read the book of nature and that 
this book is written in terms of mathematics. This persuasion is based on the fact 
that modern natural science was able to advance helped by speciﬁc languages 
tuned to exact observation and strict inferences, i.e., mathematics, and that in this 
context, the sciences were able to develop technics of measurement, instruments 
of observation (e.g., the telescope and the microscope) and strategies able to 
control the use of masses of observations and measurements by many scientists 
over the world and to communicate/discuss them effectively. “The book of nature 
is written in mathematical terms” was a dramatic simpliﬁcation by Galilei. Still, 
the scientiﬁc community has found an effective way of cumulating individual 
experience into a ﬂow of information that gives access to knowledge about the 
world and has allowed controlling it to certain limits. The scientiﬁc information 
ﬂow can be transferred to the overall population (with losses and retardation) and 
via the transfer mentioned above between individuals and society to the shared 
knowledge of a society. The conﬂict between science and religions that represent 
more or less accurately a state of knowledge some thousand years ago (in the 
time of Abraham, Jesus, or Mohammed) and modern science since Copernicus 
reﬂects the difﬁculties of a coherent and continuous information transfer between 
the world (W) (experienced and scientiﬁcally understood), the mass of human 
populations, and the social or religious entities, which make a selection out of 
these inputs. 
The critical phases of religions, ideologies, and to a certain extent, scientiﬁc 
theories concern the transition areas in these information ﬂows and the rigidity of

many knowledge systems. A solution to this problem asks for semiotic management 
that is aware of the dynamics inherent in the three-body constellation of (W) (world)– 
(I) (individual)–(C) (community, society). 
If we have added the third ontological frame (C) (community, society) to the 
traditional dual constitution in Cartesian epistemology, this was also a consequence 
of Cassirer’s reorientation toward culture, a move that was biographically linked 
to his encounter with the Warburg circle in Hamburg. However, already Cassirer’s 
historical analyses of Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), Giambattista Vico (1668–1844), 
and Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) in Cassirer (1922) show that the tradition 
of a philosophy of culture was in the center of his interests. We must, therefore, 
reﬂect on the genesis of the Philosophy of symbolic forms out of this tradition of 
cultural studies. 
7.7 
Cassirer’s “Philosophy of Symbolic Forms” in Its 
Historical Context 
Cassirer’s philosophy aims at a philosophy of human culture that addresses symbolic 
forms such as language, myth, science (later art, ethics, and technology). The meaning 
of the symbolic forms is given by the internal “reference structures” of consciousness; 
i.e., mental entities of different provenience and character are brought together. This 
trend is fully developed in human cultures and concentrated in a plurality of symbolic 
forms. The analysis of this plurality and the interrelations between the basic types is 
at the heart of Cassirer’s theory of culture. 
The position of language between scientiﬁc forms of knowledge and other forms 
of culture, such as myth and art, can be traced back to the fundamental opposi-
tion between representation and intuition. The representation most clearly expressed 
in scientiﬁc theories (and their forms of language) risks losing the immediate 
reference to human life because of its abstractness and complexity. A scientiﬁc 
language’s indirectness and intellectual instrumentality create an increasing distance 
to the archetypal human intellect (Kant), and the symbolic form runs the risk of 
becoming blind thinking (Leibniz). Pure intuition, as sought by mysticism, reduces 
the distance by eliminating the mediating, higher organized symbolic forms and risks 
becoming “speechless”, i.e., it leads to illusionary knowledge and a kind of solipsistic 
“communication”. 
In the third volume of the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms with the title:: “Phe-
nomenology of Knowledge” (Cassirer [5], vol. 3), some topics from the ﬁrst and 
second volumes are taken up again and updated. In particular, the philosophical 
contributions of Husserl, Bühler, and Heidegger are incorporated. Weyl (group 
theory), Hilbert (axiomatization), and the Erlangen program are considered in 
questions of mathematical form. Several speciﬁcations of Cassirer’s philosophy of 
symbolic forms can be discerned:

198
7
Peirce’s Semiotics, Cassirer’s Philosophy of Culture …
• Mathematics and the mathematized natural sciences allow for the analysis of 
“pure meaning”. Despite Cassirer’s objective that the philosophy of symbolic 
forms should be a philosophy of culture and his skepticism about a rapid transfer 
of results in physics to psychology and other humanities, Cassirer never gave 
up the idea of the unity of (scientiﬁc) knowledge and the guiding function of 
mathematics. 
• The basic ideas of Husserl in his books: “Logical Investigations” [13] and “Ideas 
for a pure phenomenology” [12] are condensed by Cassirer (ibid. 228–232) in the 
formula: to have sense = consciousness “because “to have sense” or “having in 
mind” is the basic character of all consciousness, which is therefore not just an 
experience in general, but a meaningful, “noetic” experience” (ibid. 230). Husserl 
is criticized because (in Cassirer’s analysis) he reintroduces the Cartesian dualism 
and separates form and content within consciousness. 
• Cassirer comments on Heidegger’s book “Sein und Zeit” (Heidegger [11]) in a 
lengthy footnote (Cassirer [5]: 173 f.). Heidegger seeks a foundation of human 
thinking in those entities that are at hand, “das zur Hand Seiende” (the “handy, 
at hand”). However, human thought can only reach the “Sein” (existing) via the 
path of symbol formation, i.e., symbolic forms are the turning point of human 
knowledge. 
• Cassirer accuses Kant of expressing his transcendental insights with concepts of 
eighteenth-century psychology (ibid. 226). In Kant’s psychological analysis, the 
“mind” acts like a sorcerer or necromancer who animates the “dead” sensation 
“and awakens it to the life of consciousness” (cf. ibid. 227). 
According to Cassirer, human intellectual history unfolds different aspects 
of language that, depending on the preferred perspective, are identiﬁed with 
science/mathematics, music, or art. These tendencies in reﬂection on the mind and 
culture suggest a close relationship between the symbolic forms mentioned. There-
fore, a philosophy of symbolic forms should reveal common principles. The speciﬁc 
theories of symbolic forms, language, myth, science (and art, ethics, and technology) 
should reﬂect the framework of a philosophy of symbolic forms, describe the differ-
ences and transitions and capture the achievements and functions of the types of 
symbolic forms. 
7.8 
Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (Cassirer) 
or Generalized Logics of Signs (Peirce): 
A Confrontation 
Cassirer reoriented himself toward a philosophy of culture during and after the First 
World War (perhaps in connection with his appointment to the University of Hamburg 
and his contacts with the Warburg circle). Peirce died in 1914, but decisive writ-
ings and lectures originated before and after 1900. Peirce and Cassirer are excellent 
connoisseurs of intellectual and scientiﬁc history since antiquity. For both, German

199
Fig. 7.3 The triangle of sign functions with examples from language use (English) 
idealism, especially Kant, is a point of orientation. After 1920, Cassirer aimed at a 
philosophy of culture and brought the evolutionarily and historically fundamental 
forms of myth and language into competition with the formal disciplines of logic 
and mathematics. 
Consequently, he abandoned the strictly ordered architecture of ideas and allowed 
for parallel and independent cultural forms, thus the plurality and not hierarchically 
ordered set of symbolic forms. Peirce had also considered a plurality of different sign 
systems and their interaction (Cassirer became only aware of Peirce’s opus in the 
forties when the Collected Works of Peirce began to be published; the ﬁrst volume 
was published in 1931; cf. Peirce [22]). 
The triad of sign functions, according to Peirce, contains sign form (represen-
tamen; S)–sign object (designated; O)–interpretant (thought, content, inner image; 
I) (Fig. 7.3). 
The notion of interpretant in Peirce’s writings has many aspects. The immediate 
interpretant is the idea of the object in the mind of the sign user. Peirce calls it 
degenerate because it neglects communication with other users and its effect on 
them.19 The dynamic interpretant focuses on the effect of a sign in another mind and 
the real consequences of these forces, including contingent factors. The notion of 
interpretant (I) is on another level of complexity than the duality of the object (O) 
and the sign (S). In the notion of interpretant, the mental meaning or image in the 
individual is completed by the other mind. It has a dialogic and pragmatic dimension. 
Compared to the three-folded ontology sketched in this chapter, the sign concept of 
Peirce takes into account all three levels.20 However, Peirce’s triangular constellation
19 In solitary thinking or inner monologue, a communicative act is only simulated; but it presupposes 
the normal usage of signs in social exchange. 
20 Saussure only distinguishes the signifying (French: “signiﬁant”, the mental image of the sign, 
e.g., the word, picture, musical theme, etc.) and the signiﬁed (French: “signiﬁé”; the mental image

does not mirror their interaction’s complexity. The notion of “interpretant” only 
“labels” the dynamics which manage this relation. Still, the forces that govern it and 
the creativity of semiosis in the interaction between S, O, and I are neither speciﬁed 
nor a theoretical account given. 
Ernst Cassirer has tried to attack this problem in his “Philosophy of Symbolic 
Forms” [5].21 Symbolic forms are based on “conceptual knowledge” and “experi-
ential knowledge”. Both levels can be integrated, leading to a complex synthesis 
demanding human creativity. At the experiential level, the ﬂow of perceptions and 
reactions is canalized into pregnant forms, i.e., individual experience is shaped by 
limitations, transitions, and values of relevance; it is the result of semiotic morpho-
genesis at the individual level. At the conceptual level, the dynamics involve more 
than individual mental processes; the relevance proﬁles of creative semiosis involve 
socio-semiotic and historical morphogenesis and self-organization.22 Both levels 
neither describe (mirror) nor construct reality; “Cassirer understands the experience 
and knowledge of reality […] as an intelligent orientation in reality” (Plümacher 
[23]: 169). This orientation depends on contexts, perspectives, and values. As a 
consequence of these insights, we distinguish two levels in the schematization of 
semiosis: an epistemic level (knowledge) and a mental level (experience). On both 
levels, a synthesis is sought, involving the underlying dynamics and speciﬁc types 
of orientation toward reality. 
7.9 
A Catastrophe Theoretical Model of the Interpretant 
(Peirce) that Integrates Cassirer’s Analysis 
Different laws operate on the epistemic and experiential levels. The dynamics of 
this synthesis deﬁne the interpretant. The orientation toward reality can establish a 
stable link between both types of dynamics.23 If this advanced notion of semiotic
of an object or object category). In Peirce, the duality introduced by Saussure is the degenerate case 
of a full-ﬂetched interpretant.
21 If Peirce seeks for a synthesis of the epistemology of Kant and Hegel in his list of categories 
(around 1870), Cassirer builds on a critique of Hegel and a new interpretation of Kant on the 
background of the advances in the natural sciences around 1900 (cf. neo-Kantianism and the Marburg 
School). He rejects “mental representations” and “representationalism” (cf. Cassirer [23]: 156ff). 
22 Cassirer objects to Hegel’s “absolute idealism”, that it presupposes a given synthesis between 
individual-psychological and historical-collective dynamics. By this identiﬁcation, Hegel’s “Pan-
logicism” drifts toward mysticism (cf. Cassirer [4]: 374). If Berkeley needed the notion of God 
to bridge the abyss of knowledge and experience, Hegel replaced God with the absolute mind 
(“absoluter Geist”), the key notion of his phenomenology. Both Kant and Hegel are aware of the 
opposition between Being and Becoming. However, they did not have the conceptual tools to catch 
the kinematics and dynamics of Becoming beyond the laws of physics. 
23 The “orientation toward reality” mentioned by Cassirer mirrors the earlier concept of “inten-
tionality” of Brentano and is still a psychological (mental) concept. However, given the threefold 
ontology introduced in Sect. 7.3, we assume that the “epistemic” level goes beyond any psycho-
logical concept. It subsumes (1) the evolutionary process in which humankind was able to get hold

synthesis is labeled (with Peirce) “interpretant”, then we must give another shape 
to Peirce’s semiotic triangle. In catastrophe theoretic semantics (cf. Wildgen [27]: 
85–94 and [28]: 218–222), the constellation of four force ﬁelds and the ﬁfth position 
of synthesis points to the catastrophe called “double cusp”. It has four attractors 
(minima = +), four saddle points (transit-points = o), and in the center, either a 
maximum (−) or another minimum (+), cf. Callahan [2].24 This analysis allows for 
a catastrophe theoretical model that elaborates and completes Peirce’s concept of 
Interpretant (Fig. 7.4). 
The transition points between the four attractors (minima, +) mediate between 
the four force ﬁelds (attractors) and constitute a circular ﬂow in which, on one side, 
dynamic aspects and mental aspects are harmonized. Conversely, the oppositions 
between sign form and sign object are managed. The Interpretant (I) is at the center 
of this cyclic process. The details of such a synthesis must be left for further research. 
This model does not solve the enigma of harmony between the world and mind or
of the permanent aspects of reality and (2) the achievement in prehistoric and historical societies to 
organize the higher apperception of reality in speciﬁc symbolic forms. The diversity of cultures and 
languages is the outcome of this process. (3) The individual mind can use this heritage to perceive 
and understand reality. Nevertheless, the success of this understanding remains incomplete and 
dependent on contexts. Whether future generations will succeed in sharpening or deepening human 
access to reality or are in danger of regressing from the level already obtained remains open. 
Nevertheless, even the stabilization of the achieved level of realism can be a success.
24 In Abraham et al. [1], a complex system of opinion formation in two states in a situation of arms 
race is modeled. In both states, hawks and doves establish a political opposition. This opposition 
can be modeled in elementary catastrophe theory with the help of the cusp (a bipolar catastrophe). 
Suppose both systems are combined and depend on each other. In that case, a double cusp situation 
is reached, containing up to ﬁve attractors, showing different types of bifurcations and limits cycles 
and chaotic dynamics under speciﬁc conditions. However, our model can only be suggestive in this 
context because neither the epistemic nor the mental dynamics are sufﬁciently well understood in 
the current state of the science.

between the epistemic and the experiential view. Still, it shows that, at least at the 
schematic level, Peirce’s triad is insufﬁcient. A model for the dynamics relating the 
mind, collective knowledge, and an orientation toward reality is due. 
The force ﬁeld between the epistemic level referring to the world (W) and the 
experiential level referring to the mind (M) and consequently between the double 
dyad of the sign relation (S, O) shows four types of dependencies: 
1. The mind (M) is part of the world (W). 
2. The mind (M) is the product of evolution in (W) and adapted to the causalities 
in (W) (e.g., survival and procreation in the evolutionary theory). 
3. Sign communication is usually between different (two or more) minds. However, 
inner monologue or thought may reduce or replace this social process. 
4. Humans use their minds, cognitive abilities, and capacity for symbolic forms to 
act in the world (W). 
The polarity of sign form (S) and sign object (O) is not rigid; instead, it is in 
motion and underlies continuous changes. Every single use of the sign rehearses 
and modiﬁes the relational ﬁeld. As a result, the connection may be reinforced or 
weakened, the shape of the sign object (S) (e.g., its phonetic or visual shape) can 
change, and the mental image (I) or the reference (O) can vary. 
7.10 
Conclusions 
Semiotics in Kepler’s style contributes to a type of practical realism mostly accepted 
by working scientists in the natural sciences. In the second half of the twentieth 
century, Thom, Zeeman, Haken, Prigogine, and their followers proposed and elabo-
rated qualitative models that bridge the bias between the humanities and the natural 
sciences. Many models in the tradition of linguistics and semiotics labeled metaphor-
ical can be reformulated and reach a scientiﬁc status. For instance, the term “valence” 
is used metaphorically in linguistics and psychology but points to the original use of 
this term in chemistry that again refers to deep mathematical insights, e.g., Descartes’ 
and Euler’s polyhedron formula, Pascal’s triangle formula, Gibbs phase rule (cf. 
Slodowy [24], Wildgen [29]: 45–56 and [35]). Central hypotheses in semiotics and 
linguistics can be reformulated in mathematical terms, tested for consistency, and 
prepared for empirical evaluation. 
It may seem to be a drawback that the richness of intuitions and theoretical imag-
inations, i.e., the poetic style in semiotics, would be lost in the Kepler style of semi-
otics. However, the accumulation of “rich” readings in the poetic style is worthless 
if no agreement is attainable in the community due to the vagueness and subjectivity 
of such contributions. Science is a collective enterprise, and all scientiﬁc proposals 
should allow for straightforward critique, response to critique in the sense of clariﬁ-
cation and modiﬁcation, and ﬁnally, in the choice of those hypotheses that promise 
further insights and advancement.

Abstract This ﬁnal chapter reﬂects possible criticisms of the assumptions in this 
book and tries to evaluate their weight and the plausibility of the strategies chosen. 
The strategical doubt concerns, ﬁrst, the application of the concept of morphogenesis 
to linguistics and semiotics (theory of symbolic forms), second, the worth of math-
ematical models, and more speciﬁcally, the preference for topological and dynamic 
models sustained in the central Chaps. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, third, the relevance of 
Cassirer’s hypothesis that the different symbolic forms present parallel modes of 
understanding the human world, and fourth, the fecundity and practicability of the 
Kepler methodology and the strategy of naturalization in the humanities. 
Morphogenesis is deﬁned and exempliﬁed mainly in biology, such as embryology and 
gastrulation. It describes the ﬁrst but decisive form giving developments of a complex, 
mainly a vertebrate body. Secondly, in applied differential topology (catastrophe 
theory), the term morphogenesis is linked to the “unfolding” of elementary dynam-
ical systems (differential equations) to structurally stable bifurcation diagrams. This 
mathematical level of abstraction builds a bridge between simple biological systems 
and cultural phenomena, for instance, the symbolic forms constitutive of human 
communication and culture. The epistemological itinerary is abductive (in the sense 
of Peirce), i.e., on the one side, empirical facts in biology and the humanities or 
cultural sciences provide a corpus of descriptions and some trends toward expla-
nation. On the other side, the formal results of mathematics give a coherent and 
well-organized architecture of concepts that allows for deductive reasoning. If both 
strategies, empirical induction and mathematical deduction, are combined correctly, 
a new scientiﬁc understanding becomes accessible. 
Our enterprise, “morphogenesis of symbolic forms,” is based on three assump-
tions. The course of the argument and the examples analyzed in this book tried to 
validate these premises. Nevertheless, they were not proven or tested experimen-
tally or based on a vast corpus of data. We shall, therefore, test their stability in 
confrontation with doubt (playing the role of an “advocatus diaboli”):

Morphogenesis. Can this concept (with its applications) be transferred from 
ovulation, gastrulation, and similar biological standard examples to the evolu-
tion of species, mainly the human evolution, the unfolding of the cognitive and 
social capacities of humans, and ﬁnally, the symbolic forms that organize human 
communication and culture? Are the formal, geometrical, and dynamic princi-
ples underlying biological morphogenesis (cf. Thom’s work) also applicable to 
cognitive (eg. human) evolution and cultural, symbolic evolution? In the biolog-
ical developments and geology ﬁeld, such evolutions are visually accessible. At 
ﬁrst view, this seems impossible in the case of cultures and symbolic forms. 
Here, a secondary premise comes into play. Morphogenesis relies heavily on 
spatial and temporal factors. If symbolic forms refer to space and time, then the 
assumption of visual accessibility gains some plausibility. But is this assump-
tion corroborated by empirical studies? The examples elaborated in Chaps. 2, 
3, 4, 5 and 6 provide some evidence but cannot cover all areas. Therefore, this 
premise remains plausible but unproven. 
(b) Relevance of mathematical, speciﬁcally geometrical/topological models. This  
argument has received support since the early nineteenth century (in psychology) 
and later in sociology and linguistics (mainly in the twentieth century). The 
trend became very strong with the use of computers after the Second World 
War.1 This rich tradition shows that without such endeavors, modern science 
would stagnate. In the case of dynamic systems theory, one can argue that the 
broadness of successful applications in the natural sciences, including biology 
and cognitive sciences, hints at these formal devices’ potential. They are less 
abstract than logics, Bourbaki structuralism (cf. [1]), or automata theoretical 
linguistics (Chomsky) and rely on a rich tradition of successful applications 
since the introduction of differential calculus by Newton and Leibniz at the end 
of the seventeenth century. 
(c) 
The philosophy of symbolic forms. Is there a common denominator for language, 
myth, science (cf. the titles of Cassirer’s trilogy 1975, published 1923–1929; [4]) 
and further manifestations, such as art, technics, ethics, politics, and economy 
(cf. for an analysis of these ﬁelds Sandkühler et al. [6]? Our hypothesis (in 
Chap. 2 was that the sensual apparatus (the human body and its contact zone 
with human ecology) is the baseline from which the morphogenesis of symbolic 
forms starts. The differences in these windows towards reality are the causes for 
the differences between the symbolic forms. The auditory sense is the window 
to music, and the visual sense is the window to art. Both senses give access 
to the use of language in its spoken and written manifestations. The myth may 
take its “material” from different senses; it further activates a kind of inner sense
1 Uniﬁcation programs in mathematics and logic and programs of a uniﬁed science appeared at the 
beginning of the twentieth century. This trend is visible in Peirce, who proposed to use relational 
logic as a fundament of semiotics; the mathematical logics of Whitehead and Russel [8] were  
the basis of the proposals of Carnap in his “Formal Syntax” [2] and later of Chomsky’s generative 
grammars. Bourbaki’s meta-mathematics based on set theory was used by Jean Piaget in his “Genetic 
Psychology” [5] and the mathematical uniﬁcation program of “category theory” was applied in 
diverse linguistic and semiotic enterprises’ (cf. Wildgen [7]).

expressed by emotions. A classical critique of such a mild “sensualism” is that 
perception’s functional and social embedding could be responsible for the differ-
ences between symbolic forms. It may even have molded animal and human 
perception and cognition capacities. This argument is an aspect of the clas-
sical nature-nurture debate. The assumption of morphogenesis and, for complex 
organisms, the assumption of self-organization does not exclude contextual, 
functional effects. It instead assumes that there is a temporal and processual 
priority for the body- and world-rooted determinations. The ﬁrst steps of evolu-
tion follow general morphogenetic principles; later, the accumulated complexity 
requires self-organization to achieve stability and permanence. Contextual and 
functional aspects are relevant throughout, but their effect becomes dominant 
later when a stable fundament of animal or human bodily organization is already 
given. The system can “pay” for complicated, even aleatory (noisy) additions. 
In crisis episodes, this richness will disappear as quickly as it has been added. 
Therefore, the scientiﬁc strategy should aim to discover the stable and essential 
aspects of human cognitive and cultural capacities.2 
(d) The naturalization in the humanities or “Kepler strategy”. Kepler, like most 
working scientists, assumes a naïve realism; he tentatively trusts his senses, 
although he knows their limits (of conﬁdence). He works hard to enlarge the 
ﬁeld of conﬁdence by using and devising better instruments and with the help 
of better exploitation of large data sets (thus in his analysis of Mars orbit). In the 
case of astronomy, an ontology of the visible (1), i.e., a realism based on the intel-
ligent use of the available techniques of observation and experimentation, may 
be sufﬁcient. Semiotics, or the analysis of symbolic forms, ask for a broader 
basis, including at least the cognitive and emotional basis of the (individual) 
human mind (2) and the integrative effects of social perception and action (3). 
The ontologies (2) and (3) depend on each other and the ontology of objects 
in the natural sciences (1). As the debate on (global and local) ontologies has 
remained open in philosophy, one must concede that our proposal of three levels 
(in the case of symbolic forms) is only a methodological hypothesis enabling 
a more transparent treatment than philosophical or metaphysical presupposi-
tions. Husserl’s notion of “local ontologies” comes near to our purpose, i.e., 
in the context of our analysis of the morphogenesis of symbolic forms, this 
position is plausible and practical. It negates a physicalist position (physical 
monism), the Cartesian dualism (mind-matter), and the chaos of a myriad of 
subjective ontologies. Our ontological levels span the ﬁeld between physics and 
the cultural sciences; the cognitive sciences animate the zone between both. 
Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 accumulate evidence that a strictly non-monistic and

problem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der Neueren Zeit” ([3]; ﬁrst edition of this volume 
in English 1950 under the title “The Problem of Knowledge. Philosophy, Science, and History 
since Hegel”). Unfortunately, his review stopped in 1932; the new synthesis of Darwinism due to 
advances in statistical modeling and modern genetics was not considered. Therefore, Cassirer is 
not a reliable source of evolution questions and underestimates the nearness of human and animal 
cognition and communication.

non-dualistic methodology can be followed and that the naturalization strategy 
leads to signiﬁcant results. It does not say that everything can be explained or 
at least described in a signiﬁcant way by following this strategy. It is sufﬁcient 
if statistically dominant and very stable features are grasped. This method will 
allow, in the long term, to access natural laws governing the ﬁeld of study, i.e., 
the manifestations of symbolic forms in human communication.
