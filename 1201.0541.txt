In this paper we ask a common psychological question and provide a physics answer: “Looking
into a mirror can one get entangled with one’s image?" This is not a frivolous question; rather, it
bears on the eﬀect of boundaries on the behavior of quantum entanglement between a harmonic
oscillator and a quantum ﬁeld, a basic problem of interest in proposed mirror-ﬁeld superposition and
related experiments in macroscopic quantum phenomena, as well as atomic ﬂuctuation forces near a
conducting surface. The object’s internal degree of freedom is modeled by a harmonic oscillator and
the presence of a perfectly reﬂecting mirror enforces the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quan-
tum ﬁeld, restricting the latter to a half space. By assuming a bilinear oscillator-ﬁeld interaction,
we derive a coupled set of equations for the oscillator’s and the ﬁeld’s Heisenberg operators. The
former can be cast in the form of a quantum Langevin equation, where the dissipation and noise
kernels respectively correspond to the retarded and Hadamard functions of the free quantum ﬁeld
in half space. We use the linear entropy as measures of entanglement between the oscillator and
the quantum ﬁeld under mirror reﬂection, then solve the early-time oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement
dynamics and compare it with that between two inertial oscillators in free space. At late times
when the combined system is in a stationary state, we obtain exact expressions for the oscillator’s
covariance matrix and show that the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement decreases as the oscillator moves
closer to the mirror. We explain this behavior qualitatively with the help of a mirror image and
provide an answer to the question raised above. We also compare this situation with the case of two
real oscillators and explain the diﬀerences.

INTRODUCTION
In this note we ask a common psychological question and provide a physics answer: “Looking into a
mirror can one get entangled with one’s image"? According to storybooks the answer for the evil queen
Q seems to be yes, a case of typical royal narcissism.
We want to ﬁnd out the answer from physical
considerations: here entanglement refers to quantum entanglement, and autangle means self-entanglement
1 , here referring to the entanglement of a real physical object Q with its mirror image. We hasten to
add that since the image is not a physical object one cannot deﬁne, let alone calculate, the entanglement
between a physical object and an unphysical construct. However, there exists entanglement between an
oscillator and a quantum ﬁeld, and we can ask how this is altered if a mirror is present.
A perfectly
reﬂecting mirror imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions on the ﬁeld along the mirror surface, restricting its
existence to a half space. These are well-deﬁned problems, belonging to the broader inquiry into the eﬀects
of boundaries and topology on the quantum ﬁeld and on quantum entanglement of objects, oscillators and
mirrors, coexisting with and/or mediated by the quantum ﬁeld. In fact, they bear on issues of importance to
quantum information and macroscopic quantum phenomena. Amongst research problems of current interest,
we mention: 1) Entanglement between two two-level (2LA) atoms via a common quantum ﬁeld already shows
diverse quantum entanglement dynamics behavior [2], ranging from sudden death, touch of death, revival
to staying always alive, and features such as dynamical generation, protection, and transfer of entanglement
between subsystems. Model studies of oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement with experimental ventures have been
carried out [3] as well as oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement in conjunction with measurements in LIGO detectors
[4], the latter also serving as preparatory studies for mirror-ﬁeld superposition [5] in macroscopic quantum
phenomena. 2) Entanglement not only changes in time but it also depends on spatial separation as shown in
model studies for 2LAs [6–8] and harmonic oscillators [9] interacting with a common quantum ﬁeld. These
results are of both theoretical interest in understanding what quantum nonlocality means, and practical
value, such as for the design of quantum gates and applications to quantum teleportation. Extending these
ﬁndings to two and three dimensional systems would enable one to deﬁne quantum entanglement domains
[12, 13] and geometric eﬀects of entanglement [14, 15]. The former refers to the eﬀective domain on a surface
or body where entanglement is induced by the presence of an oscillator, not unlike the induced surface charge
density on a conductor or dielectric plate. The latter refers to speciﬁc geometric patterns in the arrangements
of oscillators where their entanglement strength can be maximized.
Now, returning to the problem under study, one may wonder, is it really necessary to carry out such a
serious calculation in order to answer a simple query posed at the beginning: Is there entanglement between
the queen and her image? The answer is yes, both to the query and to the necessity of a bona ﬁde calculation.
As we cautioned ab initio, an image is not a physical object. Thus we try to avoid invoking an image in
this calculation so that no unphysical assumptions or intuition are brought in unnecessarily or unknowingly
in the derivations. However, at the end, by inspecting the results from the oscillator-ﬁeld (under mirror
reﬂection) entanglement we see that one can use the notion of an image to describe the process, in fact, come
up with a simple qualitative explanation of how it depends on distance.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section. II we set up the problem and derive a formal set of equations
for the Heisenberg operators of the oscillator’s internal degrees of freedom and the quantum ﬁeld. We impose
the boundary conditions introduced by the presence of the mirror and explain how the commutation relations
are altered. Next we calculate the retarded and Hadamard Green functions of the altered ﬁeld conﬁgurations
and derive a quantum Langevin equation for Q(t) including the back-reaction of the altered ﬁeld. We seek
solutions to this equation at late times and calculate the covariance matrix of the oscillator’s canonical
variables at late times when the combined system is in a stationary state. Details are contained in Appendix
A. In Sec.
III we introduce the linear entropy and the von-Neumann entropy as measures of quantum
entanglement and calculate the early-time dynamics of entanglement between the oscillator and the ﬁeld in
the oscillator-mirror setup described above. We obtain plots of how the entanglement between the oscillator
and ﬁeld in the half space with the mirror reﬂection evolves with time, depending on the distance between
the oscillator and the mirror. Finally in the discussions section we explain in what sense can one describe
this situation in terms of entanglement of the oscillator with its mirror image and why it decreases as the
oscillator moves closer to the mirror, a somewhat counterintuitive ﬁnding. We also compare this situation
1 We coin this term from two sources of inspiration: new words like 3-tangle and old ones like autism. A more learned word
‘ipso-tangle’ was suggested by Prof. Brill.

with the case of two inertial oscillators in free space (calculations placed in Appendix B) and explain their
physical diﬀerences.

OSCILLATOR INTERACTING WITH FIELD UNDER MIRROR BOUNDARY CONDITION
A.
Dynamics of Oscillator-Field System with Mirror
As described in the Introduction, the gist of the matter for this problem is to quantify the change in
some entanglement measure between the oscillator and the ﬁeld with and without the presence of a mirror.
Technically our calculation involves two parts: 1) ﬁnd the back-reaction of the ﬁeld conﬁguration altered by
the mirror on the oscillator. 2) ﬁnd the correlation functions of the resultant oscillator’s canonical variables
including the ﬁeld’s inﬂuences. Thus our target is the covariance matrix for the oscillator which incorporates
all back reactions from the quantum ﬁeld. We work with the Heisenberg equations of motion which eﬃciently
provides the oscillator’s ﬁeld-inﬂuenced dynamics. We can then ﬁnd the oscillator’s late time behavior and
quantify it’s entanglement with the modiﬁed ﬁeld.
Consider an oscillator located at position xQ at a vertical distance of L/2 from the mirror plane at x3 = 0.
The total action of the system describing this oscillator with internal degree of freedom Q interacting linearly
with a massless scalar ﬁeld conﬁned to the half space deﬁned by x3 > 0 is given by:
S[Q, ˙Q; Φ, ∂µΦ] = 1
2MQ
Z
dt ( ˙Q2 −Ω2Q2) + 1
2
Z
dt
Z
x3>0
d3x ∂µΦ∂µΦ + λQ
Z
dt Q(t)Φ(xQ, t).
(2.1)
Due to the linearity of our system the equations of motion for Heisenberg operators (carrying hats) have the
same form as the equations for the corresponding classical variables:
MQ ¨ˆQ(t) + MQΩ2 ˆQ(t) =λQ
Z
x3>0
d3x ˆΦ(xQ, t),
(2.2)
□ˆΦ(x, t) =λQδ3(x −xQ) ˆQ(t),
and
ˆΦ(x∥, x3 = 0, t) = 0.
(2.3)
Equation (2.3) speciﬁes the Dirichlet boundary (DBC) conditions imposed on the ﬁeld where the mirror
surface is located, namely, in the x3 = 0 plane and x∥= (x1, x2). To obtain the back-reaction of the ﬁeld on
the oscillator we ﬁrst solve (2.3) and then plug the solution into (2.2). The solution for ˆΦ(x, t) is given by
ˆΦ(x, t) = ˆΦ0(x, t) + λQ
Z t
ti
dt′GΦ
ret(t, x; t′, xQ) ˆQ(t′)
(2.4)
where ˆΦ0(x, t) is the homogeneous solution to equation (2.3) which describes the dynamics of the source-free
ﬁeld (without Q) in the presence of the mirror and GΦ
ret(x, t; y, t′) is the retarded Green’s function for the
ﬁeld. Plugging the solution for the ﬁeld operator into the equation of motion for the oscillator we obtain the
following equation governing the dynamics of the oscillator with the eﬀects of the ﬁeld already incorporated.
This is what we mean by the ‘ﬁeld-inﬂuenced’ dynamics of the oscillator
MQ ¨ˆQ(t) + MQΩ2 ˆQ(t) −λ2
Q
Z t
ti
dt′GΦ
ret(t, xQ; t′, xQ) ˆQ(t′) = λQ ˆΦ0(xQ, t).
(2.5)
As will be explained in further detail later the term containing the retarded Green’s function describes
how the oscillator transfers energy to the ﬁeld and the right hand side acts similarly to a Langevin forcing
term describing how quantum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations drive the oscillator.
B.
Field Modiﬁed by Mirror and Propagators in Half-space
In order to solve the equation of motion for the oscillator (2.5) we need to know the ﬁeld operators deﬁned
in the half space. Following this procedure we ﬁrst write down the free ﬁeld operator ˆΦ0 which satisﬁes the
Klein-Gordon equation and vanishes in the x3 = 0 plane,
ˆΦ0(x, t) =
Z

d3k
r

4π3ωe−iωt+ik∥·x∥sin k3x3ˆbk + H.c.
(2.6)

where ω = |k|.
Notice that the normalization factor is diﬀerent for ﬁeld in half space.
Writing (ˆΠ0(x′, t) = ˙ˆΦ0(x′, t)) and demanding that the equal-time commutation relations are satisﬁed,
that is,
[ˆΦ0(x, t), ˆΠ0(x′, t)] = iδ(3)(x −x′) −iδ(2)(x∥−x′
∥)δ(x3 + x′
3),
(2.7)
we can infer that the mode expansion coeﬃcients can be identiﬁed with the creation and annihilation oper-
ators
[ˆbk,ˆb†
k] = δk,k′,
[ˆbk,ˆbk] = 0,
[ˆb†
k,ˆb†
k] = 0.
(2.8)
Note that the commutation relation above (2.7) is not in the form normally encountered. For the case of
a ﬁeld satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the x3 = 0 plane it is necessary to add the "image
term" to the right hand side such that for points restricted to the x3 < 0 half space where the image term
has no support the relation (2.7) reduces to the standard form.
With the expression for the free ﬁeld operator in hand we now calculate the retarded and Hadamard
propagators. The retarded propagator quantiﬁes the ﬁeld sourced by the oscillator and describes how energy
is dissipated from the oscillator into the ﬁeld

EARLY TIME DYNAMICS OF OSCILLATOR-FIELD ENTANGLEMENT
In [9] the dynamics of the entanglement between two inertial oscillators with identical couplings to a
common massless scalar ﬁeld was investigated and it exhibited several interesting features. There are roughly
three temporal regimes if the two oscillators are properly separated and weakly coupled to the ﬁeld. The ﬁrst
regime is at early time, up to t ≈O(1/λ2
Q) when accumulated eﬀects of ﬁeld-mediated mutual inﬂuences,
which manifest themselves in the ﬁeld’s retarded propogators, between the oscillators are still weak and the
reduced dynamics of the oscillators are dominated by inﬂuences of vacuum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld. As the
eﬀects of ﬁeld-mediated mutual inﬂuences between the oscillators gradually gain strength, the system will
enter an intermediate regime in which the oscillators’ reduced dynamics become quite complicated. In the
late-time limit, the oscillator approaches a time-stationary state.
In particular, in [9] it was shown that at early time, after causal contact has been established between
two detectors, an oscillatory pattern of entanglement emerges which varies with the distance between the
oscillators. This is not due to mutual inﬂuences since in the weak coupling limit the mutual inﬂuence eﬀect
is always weak compared to eﬀect of vacuum ﬂuctuation.

5
For our model, we expect a similar division into three temporal regimes. Here in this section we study the
early time behavior of our model, assuming that initially both the oscillator and the ﬁeld are in their ground
states and are uncorrelated. We show that the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement also develops an oscillatory
pattern which varies with the distance between the oscillator and the mirror. At a given instant of time,
the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement exhibits spatial oscillations characterized by frequency Ω(we adopt the
convention c = 1). Additionally, we ﬁnd that the growth rate at which the oscillator-ﬁeld become entangled
oscillates as a function of the oscillator-mirror spacing.
A.
Measure of Oscillator-Field Entanglement
In our setup, the oscillator and the ﬁeld together form a closed quantum system which undergoes unitary
evolution. Since the initial state of the total system is Gaussian and the action is quadratic, the reduced
quantum state of the oscillator at any time will remain Gaussian. For such systems the amount of bipartite
entanglement between the oscillator and the ﬁeld can be quantiﬁed by the linear entropy of the oscillator’s
reduced density matrix, which takes on values diﬀerent from 0 when the oscillator and ﬁeld are entangled.
Here the linear entropy is deﬁned as
SL = 1 −P,
(3.1)
where P ≜T rˆρ2
a is the purity of the oscillator’s reduced quantum state. Here for our general mixed Gaussian
state, the purity is given by
P =
1
2
√
det V
=
1
2
q
< ˆQ, ˆQ >< ˆP, ˆP > −< ˆQ, ˆP >2
(3.2)
where < ˆOi, ˆOj >≜T r(ˆρa · { ˆOi, ˆOj})/2, ˆ
O = ( ˆQ, ˆP).
Mathematically we know that P is always less than or equal to 1. Smaller purity means the reduced
density matrix of the oscillator is less pure, and correspondingly the oscillator is more entangled with the
ﬁeld.
Another measure of bipartite entanglement between the oscillator and the ﬁeld is von Neumann entropy,
which for a single-mode mixed Gaussian state is
Sν = 1 −P
2P
ln(1 + P
1 −P ) −ln( 2P
1 + P )
(3.3)
and is a monotonically increasing function of the linear entropy. Both SL and Sν yield the same characteriza-
tion of mixedness and are equivalent as entanglement measures in the case of a single-mode mixed Gaussian
state.
B.
Mode Decomposition and EOM for Mode Functions
We perform the following mode decompositions for Heisenberg operators of the oscillator ˆQ(t) and the
ﬁeld ˆΦ(x) with respect to the creation and annihilation operators of the oscillator ˆa, ˆa† and those of the ﬁeld

Since we have assumed the oscillator’s position to be xQ(t) = ¯xQ ≡(0, 0, L/2), we have f0+(¯xQ, t; k) =
e−iωt sin k3L

According to our initial condition, the solutions have to satisfy initial conditions that f+(0, x; k) =
eik∥·x∥sin k3x3, ∂tf+(0, x; k) = −iωeik∥·x∥sin k3x3, qa(0) = 1, ∂tqa(0) = −iΩr, and fa(0, x) = ∂tfa(0, x) =

Zeroth-Order Correlation Functions
As explained before, in order to understand the dynamics of entanglement, it is suﬃcient to compute
the covariance matrix of the oscillator’s reduced quantum state. For a separable initial state, the covari-
ance matrix can be decomposed into two parts corresponding to the two sets of operators in the mode
decomposition:

correspond to terms in 3.8 and 3.12 which are of higher than zeroth order, and therefore at early time (up
to t ≈1/γQ) accumulated eﬀect of reﬂected inﬂuences is always small. Thus for the purpose of studying
the early time behavior of entanglement, we can ignore the contribution of reﬂected inﬂuences and restrict
ourselves to lowest order correlations.

In [9], for the case of two inerial oscillators distance L apart, which are located in free space with identical

Physically, the v-part of the zeroth order correlators < ... >v eﬀectively measure the response of the
oscillator to vacuum ﬂuctuations of the ﬁeld. The similarity between the integrands of < ˆQ(t), ˆQ(t) >v in
Eq.(3.18) and < ˆQA(t), ˆQB(t) >v in Eq.(3.21) is not surprising. In Appendix B we show that, if we have
two inertial oscillators C and D in free space at a distance L apart, with the same coupling constants but
in opposite signs, then ( ˆQC(t) + ˆQD(t))/2 obeys the same equation of motion as the one for ˆQ(t) in our
model. Thus we see that the self correlator < ˆQ(t), ˆQ(t) >v here has the same value as (< ˆQC, ˆQC > + <
ˆQD, ˆQD >)/4+ < ˆQC, ˆQD > /2 at t and contains the part of correlations of vacuum ﬂuctuation in free space
which is odd with respect to the z3 = 0 plane, whereas < ˆQC(t), ˆQD(t) >v∝(−λQ)λQ here has exactly the
same value of −< ˆQA(t), ˆQB(t) >v in [9] because the two oscillators in [9] are identically coupled to the
ﬁeld and so < ˆQA, ˆQB >v∝λQλQ.

Early-time Dynamics of Oscillator-ﬁeld Entanglement
With the previous results we can now investigate the evolution of oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement as the
distance between the oscillator and the mirror changes. Whereas it may be possible to obtain an approximate
analytical expression in the weak coupling limit, we can simply study the dependence of the linear entropy
on L and t numerically, as shown in Figure 1.
Our numerical results reveal the following behaviors:
• For a given L, the entanglement between the oscillator and the ﬁeld increases monotonically at early
times, showing that the oscillator is getting more and more entangled with the ﬁeld after the interaction
is turned on. (See Figure 1 (upper row) and (lower right).)

and Ω= 5. The upper left plot shows the linear entropy as a function of L and t, with the upperright plot being its
contour plot. The lowerleft plot shows the dependence of linear entropy on L at a given instant of time whereas the
lower right plot exhibits how the linear entropy evolves with time for oscillator located at a certain distance.
• Within the light cone, at every given time in this stage, the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement exhibits an
oscillatory behavior with spatial frequency being Ω. This shows that the growth rate of SL with which
the oscillator gets entangled with the ﬁeld also oscillates as a function of L, as shown in Figure 1 (upper
row) and (lower left).
Such oscillatory behavior in L is solely due to the oscillatory behavior of the zeroth order correlators corre-
sponding to < ˆRC, ˆRD >v, R = Q, P, given in the last paragraph of the previous subsection. After cos θ in
k3 ≡ω cos θ has been integrated over the interval [0, 1] in the integration corresponding to < ˆQC, ˆQD >v in
(3.18) or (3.21), the ﬁeld modes on resonance with the oscillator have constructive (destructive) interference
at the local maxima (minima) of SL against L at ﬁxed t at early times.
In [9] the early time dynamics of entanglement between the two oscillators exhibit similar oscillatory
dependence on the distance between them, which is also due to distance-dependent correlations of vacuum
ﬂuctutaions experienced by the oscillators. More precisely, from (3.21) one can see that the ﬁeld modes with
ω = nπ/L, n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, has no contribution at all to the integration of < ˆQA, ˆQB >v, and those satisfying
tan ωL = ωL give the maximum and minimum values of the factor sin ωL/(ωL) in the integrand. In the
weak coupling limit the integration in (3.21) is mainly contributed by the poles at ω ≈±Ω, namely, those
mode on resonance with the oscillators. So < ˆQC, ˆQD >v≈0 for L ≈nπ/Ω, while < ˆQC, ˆQD >v has local
maximum or minimum values when L is about the solution of tan ΩL = ΩL in the weak coupling limit.

LATE-TIME STATIONARY LIMIT OF OSCILLATOR-FIELD ENTANGLEMENT
A.
Quantum Langevin Equation and Covariance Matrix at Late-times
One can compare the dynamics of the oscillator under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld to the well-studied quantum
Brownian motion (QBM) model, namely, the retarded and Hadamard Green functions correspond to the
dissipation and noise kernels respectively and the function I(ω; x, y) represents the spectral density [see, e.g.,
[22, 23]) and the references therein.] In the same vein Eq. (2.5) can equivalently be written as a quantum
Langevin equation
MQ ¨ˆQ(t) + MQΩ2 ˆQ(t) −

and ˆξ(t) = λQ ˆΦ0(xQ, t).
In the integrals over the frequency above and below we have assumed a high
frequency ﬁnite cutoﬀΛ for the quantum ﬁeld Λ which regularizes the quantum ﬁeld’s retarded Green’s
function from which we obtain the eﬀective equations of motion of the oscillator [9]. In QBM language µ is
the dissipation kernel, ν(t, s) is the noise kernel which quantiﬁes the two-time correlation of the Langevin
forcing term ˆξ(t),
ν(t, s) ≡⟨{ˆξ(t), ˆξ(s)}⟩= λ2

[From now on we simply denote I(ω) ≜I(ω; xQ, xQ).] Here the average is taken with respect to the initial
state density matrix of the ﬁeld.
By introducing the damping kernel γ(t, s) deﬁned by
µ(τ, s) = MQ
∂
∂τ γ(τ, s) = MQ
∂
∂sγ(τ, s),
(4.4)
we can bring (2.5) to the ﬁnal form

dτγ(t, τ) · ˙ˆQ(τ) + 2MQγ(t, ti) · ˆQ(ti) = ˆξ(t),
(4.5)
where Ω2

The general solution to (4.1) is given by
ˆQ(t) = ˆQ0(t) +
Z t
ti
ds ˜G(t, s)ˆξ(s),
(4.6)
where ˜G(t, s) is the retarded Green’s function for (4.1) satisfying
MQ ¨˜G(t, s) + MQΩ2 ˜G(t, s) −
Z t
ti
dτµ(t, τ) · ˜G(τ, s) = δ(t −s).
(4.7)
For here and below all the Fourier components are deﬁned for positive frequency only, which correspond
to Fourier transformation of function deﬁned on t > 0. Accordingly, the Fourier space representation of the
above Green’s function can be written as:
˜G(ω) ≡(MQ(−ω2 + Ω2) −µ(ω))−1
≜(−ω2 −iωγ(ω) + Ω2
r)−1M −1
Q .
(4.8)

11
In the late-time stationary limit, because µ(t, s) leads to dissipation of the oscillator’s free motion, we see
that
˜ˆQ(ω) →˜G(ω)˜ˆξ(ω).
(4.9)
As has been explained before, if we assume the initial state of our combined system to be Gaussian, then
because the total Hamiltonian is quadratic, the quantum state of the oscillator will always be Gaussian and
can be fully characterized by the covariance matrix
(V )ij(t) = 1
2⟨ˆOi(t) ˆO(t)j + ˆOj(t) ˆOi(t)⟩,
(4.10)
in which ˆ
O = ( ˆQ, ˆP).
In the late-time stationary limit the elements V ∞
QP vanish, as can be inferred from VQP (t) = M ˙VQQ(t)/2
if VQQ(t) approaches an asymptotic constant value.

Entanglement between Oscillator and Field in Free Space
We will begin by calculating the late-time oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement for an oscillator in free space. We
then compute the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement with a mirror present and compare their diﬀerences. The
ﬁrst step is to regularize the retarded Green’s function of the ﬁeld at the trajectory of the detector. For an
oscillator interacting with a massless scalar ﬁeld in free space, the entire system is governed by the action

which is the same as Eq. (2.1) but without the x3 > 0 restriction.
Following [9] we obtain

Entanglement between Oscillator and Field under Mirror Reﬂection
In the presence of a perfect mirror, the entire system is governed by action (2.1). The Heisenberg equation
of motion for the oscillator after the same regularization as above is

[−(ω + iγQ)2 + ˜Ω2

(4.23)
where the last term inside the square brackets shows the diﬀerence from the free space results. It can be
interpreted as the contribution from the oscillator’s mirror image located at a vertical distance L/2 behind
the mirror.
For this case the exact late-time covariance matrix becomes

In Figure 2 (upper-left) we see that ∆SL < 0, thus the presence of the mirror always acts to reduce the
linear entropy between the oscillator and the ﬁeld, thereby causing them to be less entangled.
In the same plot one can also see that ∆SL increases monotonically with L and goes to 0 as L →∞.
This fact can be intuitively understood by inspecting the Heisenberg equation of motion of the oscillator’s
internal degree of freedom. As shown in (4.22), due to mirror reﬂection, the oscillator’s internal degree
of freedom will have an negative inﬂuence upon itself after time L through ﬁeld propagation. This will
eﬀectively reduce the quadrature V ∞
QQ and V ∞
P P and hence cause the oscillator to be less entangled with the
ﬁeld as it moves closer to the mirror.
As one would naturally expect, as the oscillator becomes more and more strongly coupled with the ﬁeld,
the oscillator-ﬁeld entanglement increases monotonically, as shown in the lower plot of Figure 2.
D.
Eﬀect of Mirror Image versus Eﬀect of Real Object
In our setup, the lowest order correction to self-correlators corresponds to the physical process in which the
oscillator emits a quanta and then interact with it after it is reﬂected by the mirror. Ths process contributes
a correction of order O(γQ/L), according to (4.28) and (4.29). On the other hand, as stated in Appendix
B, in the case of two inertial oscillators with opposite coupling constant, the lowest order correction to self-
correlators corresponds to the following physical process: oscillator A emits a quanta, which interacts with
oscillator B, then the back reaction from oscillator B to the ﬁeld echoes back and interacts with oscillator A.
The contribution of this process is of order O(γ2
Q/L2). Therefore, the inﬂuence of the mirror and a real image
oscillator correspond to diﬀerent physical processes and are of diﬀerent orders in the coupling constant.
V.
DISCUSSION
We began with a rather naive question about whether quantum entanglement can exist between a physical
object (the evil queen Q modeled by a harmonic oscillator) with her mirror image. The immediate answer
from a formalist could be no, because an image is not a physical object and only physical quantum objects
can get entangled. What we really wanted to ﬁnd out in this inquiry is the eﬀect of boundaries on quantum
entanglement, as that between an atom and its trap or cavity surface. Our calculation leading to an answer
to this query took on three steps 1) Entanglement exists between an oscillator and a quantum ﬁeld; 2) The

presence of a mirror alters the ﬁeld conﬁguration, namely, a perfectly reﬂecting mirror imposes a Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the ﬁeld along the mirror surface; 3) The symmetry in the expression we derived
for the entanglement between the oscillator and the ﬁeld in half space with Dirichlet boundary conditions
imposed on the mirror surface suggests that it is as if the oscillator was entangled with its image located
at distance L/2 on the other side of the mirror. We expound the meaning of these statements with the
following observations: a) This entanglement is diﬀerent both from that of an oscillator with the quantum
ﬁeld in free space, i.e., without a mirror, and that between two physical oscillators at distance L apart. b)
The statement of "entanglement between an oscillator with its image" should always be understood as "the
entanglement of an oscillator with the quantum ﬁeld in half space under Dirichlet boundary conditions". c)
Note that this substitute description works only for Dirichlet conditions, it fails if a Neumann condition was
imposed on the boundary instead.
Developing this theme further, one can see more clearly which parties are being entangled if one considers
a microscopic model of a mirror such as the one considered by Galley et al [28], where the mirror’s internal
degrees of freedom is modeled by an oscillator (called mirosc) with very light mass (whereby the quantum
ﬂuctuations of the mirrors internal degrees of freedom will be suppressed). With this setup we could then
consider three physical degrees of freedom: the oscillator, the ﬁeld and the mirosc (the light degrees of
freedom making up the mirror). If one ﬁrst considers the interaction between the mirosc and the ﬁeld, this
would yield in the zero mirosc mass or inﬁnite reﬂectivity limit the modiﬁed ﬁeld conﬁguration derived here.
Then from the covariance matrix of the oscillator one can derive the entanglement between the oscillator
and the modiﬁed ﬁeld. With a microphysical model of the mirror one can calculate how the dynamics of
the mirosc is altered while interacting with the ﬁeld, how the ﬁeld is modiﬁed, and how the oscillator is
entangled with the modiﬁed ﬁeld. The advantage of this is that one can see clearly how this entanglement
can be interpreted as the entanglement between the oscillator and the mirosc (for an example of the successive
levels of coarse-graining , see, e.g., [16]). This reminds us of a similar procedure in electrostatics, namely, how

15
the force between a charge and the induced surface charge density on a conducting plate can be calculated
using the image charge method.
Another observation using elementary physics of wave reﬂection upon a mirror is the following: Since
the ﬁeld conﬁguration is at the base of inquires into boundary eﬀects on the oscillator ﬁeld entanglement,
the behavior of reﬂected waves could provide some useful guide in building up our intuition on quantum
entanglement in this setting. Instead of a mirror with perfect reﬂectivity we can think of two adjoining
dielectric media 1, 2 with dielectric coeﬃcients ǫ1 < ǫ2 (the mirror situation considered above corresponds to
the case where ǫ1 is the vacuum ǫ0, much smaller than ǫ2). For waves propagating from a soft medium 1 to a
hard medium 2, the reﬂected wave is inverted. This show up in the reﬂected ﬁeld conﬁguration carrying an
opposite sign from the original ﬁeld conﬁguration, thus partially canceling it. This cancelation eﬀect is more
severe near the mirror surface and hence we see the decrease of entanglement as the oscillator gets closer to
the mirror. If this reasoning is correct then in the reverse situation, if the queen were a water nymph living
in a lake (medium 2), looking up at the sky (the air is medium 1, where we have assumed ǫ2 > ǫ1). As waves
from the heavy medium entering a light medium will be reﬂected at the interface with a positive amplitude,
the entanglement would increase as the nymph comes up close to the water-air surface. Thus we can add
a fourth factor, 4) that of parity in reﬂection. Fairy tales aside, when the experimental techniques improve
to the extent that one can measure the quantum entanglement between an atom and the trap surface these
results could be of some practical value.
Our next paper [29] will treat the quantum entanglement between an atom and a dielectric medium. We
will adopt the inﬂuence functional method recently used for the treatment of ﬂuctuation forces between an
atom and a dielectric medium [16]. As a small corollary we will be able to check on the correctness of the
above qualitative argument based on symmetry and parity considerations. Later papers in this series will
address entanglement domain and entanglement pattern, and a parallel series on quantum entanglement
in topologically non-trivial spaces starting with R1×S1 [30], which can be applied to atoms in a toroidal trap.

Appendix B: Comparison with the case of two inertial oscillators
In Section VI of Ref. [9], we have obtained the late-time correlators in the case with two identical Unruh-
DeWitt detectors at rest at x3 = ±L/2. Let λ0 →−λQ for the left detector (QA) and λ0 →+λQ for
the right detector (QB), one may wonder whether the detector on the right (QB at x3 = +L/2) in this
two-detector case would behave the same as the detector at the same position (say, ˜QB at x3 = +L/2) in
the above single-detector case with its image detector.
The answer is no. The presence of the other detector separated in a distance L from one detector introduces
corrections to the late-time correlators of a single detector, which are O(γ2
Q/L2) for the self correlators and
O(γQ/L) for the cross correlators. This is diﬀerent from the above self correlators VQQ and VP P , which have
δVQQ and δVP P in O(γQ/L).
This can be understood as follows. The late-time behavior of the correlators in [9] are determined by mode
functions q(+)
A (t, k) and q(+)
B (t, k), whose equation of motion reads (Eq.(13) in [9] with d and λ0 modiﬁed)

(B2)
Similar to Eqs. (A6)-(A11) in [9], these equations give the same c0
k for q(+)
B
like (A11), while the counterpart
for QA is −c0
k. So the late-time self correlators are still given by Eqs. (48) and (50) in [9], and the cross
correlators are those in Eqs. (49) and (51) multiplied by −1. From Eqs. (54) and (55) in [9], one can see that

in weak coupling limit the late-time cross correlators are O(γQ/L) and the correction to the self correlators
is O(γ2
Q/L2).
On the other hand, the detector in this paper has

q+(t, k) = −2γQ

where q+(t −L, k) on the right hand side can be interpreted as the image of q+. Indeed, (B3) gives

which is exactly the V ∞

Note that the ﬁrst order correction to V ∞
QQ in free space has exactly the same value as the late-time cross
correlator ⟨{ ˆQA, ˆQB} ⟩in the case with two inertial detectors considered above. However, the latter will
not enter the reduced density matrix of ˆQB. Compare (B3) with (B1) and (B2), one can see that it is
