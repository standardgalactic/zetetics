Abstract
We provide a categorical interpretation for escrows, i.e. trading protocols in trustless environment,
where the exchange between two agents is mediated by a third party where the buyer locks the
money until they receive the goods they want from the seller.
A simplified escrow system can be modeled as a certain kind of optic in a monoidal category M
(e.g., the category of sets with cartesian product); escrows can be regarded as morphisms of a category
E(M), with the same objects of M, and where the hom-objects are ⟨X, Y ⟩= OpticM([ Y
X ] , [ X
Y ]).
When X is a comonoid and Y is a monoid in M, E(M)(X, Y ) is a monoid in Set (or in the base of
enrichment chosen to model one’s specific problem), acting on the set of optics [ B
B ] →[ X
Y ]. Moreover,
we define a map
◁: ⟨Y, X⟩× Optic([ Y
X ] , [ B
B ])
/ Optic([ Y
X ] ,  X⊗B
Y ⊗B

)
having action-like properties.
This has the following interpretation: the object B acts as an
intermediary in a transaction between X and Y , modeled by an escrow in ⟨Y, X⟩.

Introduction
In their most basic form, escrows can be described as a way to enforce mutual destruction in
a trustless transactional environment.
Let us unpack this definition. In our work, a transaction will mean an exchange of goods,
whereas a trade will be a mutual exchange of goods defined by transactions. For example,
the transactions ‘Asmodeus pays money to Belial’ and ‘Belial gives apples to Asmodeus’
will define a (familiar) trade where Asmodeus buys some apples from Belial.1 The structure
of a simple trade is depicted below, with the downward-pointing arrows representing the
flow of time. Now, an environment for a transaction is ‘standard’ if trades happen in-person
1 We choose to summon slightly more powerful entities than Alice and Bob for our paper: Asmodeus
(!)אָש מְדּאָיis a powerful demon of destruction, greed, wrath, discord, and vengeance; Belial (!)בְּלִי®עַלis
a demon of impurity and corruption; cf. [11, I-490, 502]. Later in the discussion, an entity named
Chemosh (!)כְּמוֹשׁwill appear; Chemosh is the Hebraic name of the old Akkadian deity Kâmuš, later
identified by Milton with th’ obscene dread of Moab’s sons in [11, I-406].

and in a situation where at least some basic form of law enforcement exists. In a legally
standard environment, all parties in a trade can enforce exchange on the spot: if Asmodeus
pays Belial, but Belial refuses to give Asmodeus apples, Asmodeus can go to the police,
refuse to leave the shop until a refund or the goods are received, or hit Belial on the head,
depending on the jurisdiction in which they are. The same argument holds for Belial, which
allows keeping the basic structure of trades quite simple in most situations. In an economy
of scale, Asmodeus and Belial can transact over long distances by relying on a network of
mutual bonds of trusts defining a banking system.
Things change radically in a trustless environment, where only part of the trade can be
enforced. The most typical example is internet commerce, and in particular blockchains, for
the following reasons:
In some cases, identities are pseudonymous or fully anonymous. Even when they are
not, the parties taking part in a trade often live in different jurisdictions, making the
application of law enforcement difficult or impossible.
In some cases, the nature of the goods being traded may make it difficult or outright
impossible to enforce a trade by legal means. The obvious example is people buying
illegal goods or services on marketplaces such as SilkRoad [22]. Here, even in a quarrel,
no parties will ask the police for help lest they be incarcerated for far bigger crimes.
In some cases, only part of the trade can be enforced and accounted for. This problem
is particularly evident in a blockchain setting: The transaction ‘Asmodeus gives some
bitcoins to Belial’ is publicly verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain, and no dispute can
arise in this respect. On the contrary, there is no easy way to account for ‘Belial shipped
apples (or drugs) to Asmodeus’: We will have to rely on Belial’s word.
In such a setting, since we cannot suppose in any way that Asmodeus and Belial know or
trust each other, we see that a massive problem arises with trades as we usually conceive
them: If Asmodeus pays Belial, Belial can run away without ever shipping the goods.
On the contrary, if Belial ships the goods first, Asmodeus can receive them and never pay
Belial back. More importantly, in a trustless paying system such as Bitcoin, there is no
way for Asmodeus to claim money back in case of scams.
Escrows are a way to fix this problem. In their most basic form, they work as follows:
To buy some goods from Belial, Asmodeus puts a sum of money totalling the price of
the goods bought in an escrow system. This method consists of a vault where money can
go in but not out. Asmodeus, and only Asmodeus, has the power to release the money at
a later stage. When doing so, the money is automatically sent to Belial;
Belial can publicly check that the money is in the escrow vault. Belial can be sure
that the only way the money can leave the escrow is by being sent to him.

Belial ships the goods to Asmodeus;
Upon receiving them, Asmodeus can release her escrow so that Belial is paid.
This system is far from perfect, and various refinements of it have been proposed.
Still, even in this basic form, we can appreciate how escrows turn the strategy ‘running
away with the money/goods’ into a non-rational choice. In refusing to ship the goods,
Belial doesn’t gain any money because Asmodeus will never release the escrow. Similarly,
in refusing to pay Belial, Asmodeus will never get her money back. So, both Asmodeus and
Belial have no economic incentive in not upholding their side of the trade and may do so
only if motivated by irrational motives such as pure trolling.2 The basic structure of an
escrow is depicted in the figure above. This paper aims to describe escrows formally, with
a particular focus on their compositional nature. Our main contribution is showing that
escrows are examples of an optic and that thus they organise in a category whose composition
law accounts for a tangible property of this kind of transactions.
1.1
Related work on optics, and conventions
Optics originated in functional programming as a compositional solution to the problem
of accessing fields of nested data structures; currently, optics find application in diverse
branches of applied category theory like categorical probability theory [19, 20] the theory of
open games [5, 6] (see also the connection with lenses, particular optics: [8, 7]; see [21] for a
categorical overview and generalisation) functional programming [15, 14, 2, 3]; see [1] for a
string-diagrammatic calculus (which is not the one we employ here; instead, we use [18]).
The blanket assumption that we make throughout the entire paper is to work in a fixed
symmetric monoidal category M. We will use the string diagram notation for monoidal
categories whenever convenient –that is, always. We freely employ basic facts about monoidal
categories [9], the notion of actions of an internal monoid in a monoidal category, and
elementary facts about ‘coend calculus’ [10], namely the fact that given a category X and a
functor T : X op × X →Set its ‘coend’
R X T(X, X) is the coequaliser
`
Y →X T(X, Y )
/
/
`
X∈X T(X, X)
/ R X T(X, X)
(1.1)
2 Whoever is familiar with the blockchain ecosystem –and with life over the Internet– knows that this is
still a big problem. In practice, the introduction of time windows that release the escrow to the original
owner if certain conditions are met can mitigate the problem. For the sake of simplicity, we will not
focus on this in this work.

Escrows are optics
of a suitable pair of maps defined by the conjoint action of T on morphisms (see [10, (1.29)]).
Although indirectly, we work the notion of bicategory of profunctors; the bicategory Prof
has objects the small categories A, B, 1-cells from A to B, denoted A 7→B, are the functors
P : Aop × B →Set, and 2-cells between P, Q : A 7→B are the morphisms in the category
Cat(Aop × B, Set). The 1-cells of Prof can be composed with a ‘matrix product’ rule
Q ⊙P : A 7→C : (A, C) 7→
Z B
P(A, B) × Q(B, C)
(1.2)
if P : A 7→B and Q : B 7→C.

Escrows are optics
In the following, we interpret objects A (Asmodeus), B (Belial), . . . of M as entities of
some kind, transacting in money and goods. As already discussed, we assume the interaction
between A, B ∈M is always non-spiteful, in the sense that we dismiss the possibility that A
(resp., B) wants to cause damage to B (resp., A) even at the cost of losing money (resp.,
goods).
Morphisms A →B will be interpreted from time to time as exchanges of goods, money
or information between A and B.
On one side, money and goods are resources, and as such, they can be compounded (‘if A
gives me an apple and B gives me a pear, I have an apple and a pear’). On the other hand,
information is not a resource and can be copied ad libitum: I can tell everyone that I have
an apple as long as I want.
We highlight the difference between exchanges of resources and exchanges of information
by depicting the former in green and the latter in red.
Countless categorical structures have been proposed to achieve a complete formalisation
of this difference. Here, we will try to get away with as few assumptions as we can.
In this setting, a simple trade like the one in Figure 1 can be represented as a couple of
morphisms
A

oriented from left to right.
A morphism A →B represents a money transfer from A to B (in this case, Bitcoins).
Similarly, a morphism B →A represents the transfer of goods from B to A (in this case,
weapons).
Composing these morphisms expresses the idea of A turning her money into goods and
B turning his goods into money. An escrow, as we designed it, is given by:

An important remark on the graphical representation of optics is now in order:
▶Remark 1. Our treatment of optics is based on a less sophisticated idea than the one used
in functional programming, i.e. the intuition that an optic is a device that can be pictorially

‘waiting for’ a morphism f : A →B to produce a morphism S →T.
Notice how the morphism B →A above is depicted in red. It represents the information
witnessing that an exchange of goods has happened.
This is compatible with a setting –such as the blockchain– where the morphism A →B
(exchange of money) can be accounted for and publicly verified, while the morphism B →A
(the goods have been shipped and received), cannot.
We see that, in this perspective, an escrow is nothing more than a way to wrap an
unaccountable morphism B →A inside an accountable morphism A →B: In other words,
we split the morphism A →B in two parts, and sandwich the morphism B →A in the
middle. Taking things apart, we get:

The diagram on the left now has the familiar shape of a comb, furthering our suspects that
it is indeed an optic, while the diagram on the right is just a morphism. Recall the following,
which is a particular case of [4, 2.1].
▶Definition 2 (The category of optics). Let M be a monoidal category; define the category
OpticM (or Optic for short) of optics as having
objects the pairs [ A
B ] in M;
morphisms [ A
B ] →[ S
T ] defined by the coend
Z M∈M
M(S, M ⊗A) × M(M ⊗B, T).
(2.3)
▶Remark 3. With this definition in mind, we can provide an equational description of the
escrow diagram in Equation (2.1). The diagram therein should clarify the aforementioned
intuition that an equivalence class in the coend in Equation (2.3) consists of a pair of
morphisms u : S →M ⊗A and v : M ⊗B →T ‘waiting for’ a morphism f : A →B in order
to compose into a morphism S →T as
S
u
/ M ⊗A
M⊗f / M ⊗B
v
/ T
(2.4)
Evidently, the family of maps τM : M(S, M ⊗A) × M(M ⊗B, T) × M(A, B) determined
by the rule (u, v, f) 7→v ◦M ⊗f ◦u is a cowedge in M, so that there exists a unique
¯τ : Optic([ A
B ] , [ S
T ]) →M(S, T).
Graphical manipulation provides an efficient way to handle the coend and the equivalence
classes therein.
We are now ready to introduce our main definition:
▶Definition 4. An escrow from A to B is an optic [ B
A ] →[ A
B ].
We record another definition for further use, that of a Tambara module: a symmetric version
of the original definition in [13, §3] is enough for our purposes; a more general notion of
Tambara module for a pair left/right actegory on a monoidal base is given in [4, 4.1].

▶Definition 5. Let M be a (symmetric) monoidal category; a Tambara module consists of
a profunctor P : M 7→M endowed with maps
α[M]
AB : P(A, B)
/ P(M ⊗A, M ⊗B)
(2.5)
satisfying suitable compatibility conditions with the associator and the unitor of the monoidal
structure:

▶Remark 6. Tambara modules are the objects of a category Tamb where the hom-set
between a Tambara module (P, α) and a Tambara module (Q, β) is the pullback of certain
two equalisers (we will not need an explicit description of this hom-set; the reader is invited
to consult [4] for the definition).
All this will turn out useful in the proof of our Proposition 7.

Composing escrows
Leveraging on the notions of composition for optics described in [17] and [16], we get that
we can compose escrows as follows:
A

B
A
E1

B

C
B
E2

C
A

B


Although very natural, both compositions are rather uninteresting. The one on the left
models the idea that Belial uses the money obtained from an escrow deal with Asmodeus to
open an escrow deal with a third entity C (Chemosh). The one on the right composes escrows
with the usual optic composition and models the fact that escrows between A and B, being
either optics [ A
B ] →[ B
A ] or optics [ B
A ] →[ A
B ], can be nested into each other (indefinitely).
What we are interested in is a notion of composition modelling trades happening with an
intermediary: A opens an escrow trade with B, which in turns makes an escrow trade with
C, obtains the goods, and sends them back to A:

As one can see, there is a witness B →A that unlocks the escrow that A makes with B, and
a witness C →B that unlocks the escrow that B makes with C. These two witnesses are
composed to obtain the witness that unlocks the composite escrow. This makes intuitive
sense: B shoulnd’t be able to unlock his funds until the delivery of goods from C all the way
to A is completed. On the other hand, C depends on B’s behavior for their own payment.
To better understand this, imagine the following scenario: C successfully delivers the goods
to B, while B fails to deliver to A. In such a setting, C won’t be paid even if they completed
their work successfully. This is because the escrow composition defers C’s payment to the
moment when the whole escrow sequence is completed. Moreover, we see that in such a
setting B unlocks his own escrow before C, and as such we informally deem B’s behavior as
‘greedy’. There are other ways to compose the building blocks of these two escrows to obtain
a ‘gentleman B’ scenario where the escrow between B and C is settled indepentently –and
before– of B’s escrow with A, but we weren’t able to find a convincing categorical description
of this composition, which we thus omit.
We now formalize the escrow composition highlighted in the picture above.
In the
following, we shorten the set Optic([ S
T ] , [ T
S ]) as ⟨T, S⟩.
For a pair (h, k) of elements in ⟨U, T⟩× ⟨T, S⟩, we define a ‘composition’
⋄
: ⟨U, T⟩× ⟨T, S⟩
/ ⟨U, S⟩: (k, h) 7→k ⋄h
(3.1)
as follows:
first choose representative elements for h, k inside the equivalence classes of the two
coends involved: let’s say h ∈
R M∈M M(T, M ⊗S) × M(M ⊗T, S) is represented by a
pair (h1, h2) where
h1 : T →M ⊗S,
h2 : M ⊗T →S
(3.2)
for M ∈M, and similarly, k ∈
R N∈M M(U, N ⊗T) × M(N ⊗U, T) is a pair (k1, k2):
k1 : U →N ⊗T,
k2 : N ⊗U →T
(3.3)
for N ∈M.
second, send these pairs to the composite arrows

(N ⊗h1) ◦k1, h2 ◦(M ⊗k2) ◦(σN,M ⊗U)

(3.4)
In terms of string diagrams, this is what happens: the two pairs

h1

get sent to the (equivalence class of the) pair

where a twisting N ⊗M →M ⊗N has been introduced in order for (k ⋄h)1 and (k ⋄h)2 to
have the correct domains.

Escrows are optics
▶Remark 1. This is a well-defined correspondence, i.e. it yields the same result if we change
representatives in the same equivalence classes of h, k: in order to see this, recall that the
equivalence relation in the coend in Equation (2.3) is generated by the pair of maps
X
u:M→N
M(T, M ⊗S) × M(N ⊗T, S)
l

r

M(T, A ⊗S) × M(A ⊗T, S)

acting as follows for a given u : M →N:
lu(f, g) =
 (u ⊗S) ◦f, g

;
ru(f, g) =
 f, g ◦(u ⊗T)

.
The quickest way to see that the operation defined in Equation (3.6) is compatible with this
equivalence relation is through string diagram representation: writing morphisms as ‘combs’
we get that
l(u,v)(h1, h2) ⋄(k1, k2) =
 
u
v
,
!

v

= (h1, h2) ⋄r(u,v)(k1, k2).
▶Proposition 2. The rule above is associative and unital: this means that the diagrams

Using Agents as Intermediaries
In Section 3 we described escrow composition roughly as ‘to trade with Chemosh, Asmodeus
opens an escrow with Belial, Belial opens an escrow with Chemosh, goods are delivered,
and the escrows are separately settled’. This kind of composition has its drawbacks, and to
understand them, we will have to briefly venture into the exciting (?) world of legal matters.
In our escrow composition, B is essentially buying the goods from C on behalf of A.
Legally, the trades between A and B and B and C are independent, and B is considered a
freelancer, for which the law entails a precise taxation regime.
Nevertheless, sometimes we would like to have B considered as an employee working for
C. For example, C may be a producer, and B may be an intermediate agent that stockpiles
a warehouse of goods produced by C, selling them on their behalf. Tax-wise, these two
scenarios are very different, so we want to design an escrow procedure ‘sensitive to the
taxation regime’. One possibility is the following:
A

C
A
EA

C
B

C
A
EB

B
C
V
B
V
A
As one can see, we have a standard escrow between A and C. Independently from this, we
have another optic where B puts some funds in escrow, but this time it is A that can unlock
it. In doing so, B gets back his own money. In doing so, B is never buying merchandise
from C since there is no transfer of money from B to C. We interpret this as having B
acting as an intermediary: B stakes some collateral to ensure that he will not run away with
C’s merchandise and receives the collateral back once the trade between A and C is settled.
There are a couple of striking features in this construction:
The collateralization of B’s money is not an optic [ B
X ] →[ X
B ] for some X, and thus not
an escrow according to our definition;
The morphism witnessing an exchange of goods from C to A is again obtained composing
the witnesses B →A and C →B and should be used twice in this construction to fill
both combs. This situation is compatible with the interpretation that combs are to be
filled with red, information-like morphisms.
We need to pre-compose the comb with some morphism of type B →A ⊗B: intuitively,
B must be available before the escrow deal between A and C is set up, and signal his
availability to A;
We need to post-compose the comb with some morphism of type C ⊗B →B: Intuitively,
if B works for C, some form of settlement between the two must take place after the
mediated escrow is concluded.

Information and resources
Let’s start by recalling a general fact: let M be a monoidal category, let A be a comonoid
and C be a monoid in M. Then, the hom-set M(A, C) becomes a monoid, whose operation
is called convolution, and it is defined as
(f, g) 7→f ∗g : A
c
/ A ⊗A
f⊗g / C ⊗C
m
/ C
(4.1)
where c : A →A ⊗A is the comultiplication and m : C ⊗C →C the multiplication map.
We can use a similar idea to prove that the set of optics [ C
A ] →[ A
C ] is a monoid.
▶Lemma 1. Let A, C be objects of M, let A be a comonoid, and C be a monoid. Then, the
set of escrows ⟨A, C⟩is a monoid.
Proof. One routinely checks the associativity and unit axioms from the following definitions:
given two escrows (h1, h2) and (k1, k2) as in
 
h1

C
M ,
h2
C

(4.2)
we compose them into the escrow h ⊗k
h1
k1
h2
k2
(4.3)
using the monoid and comonoid structures of C, A respectively;
the unit escrow (i1, i2) is the lower morphism in
h1
h2
i1
i2
(4.4)
obtained using the counit of A and the unit of C. Evidently, the co/monoid rules entail
that h ⊗i is just equal to h, for every other optic h = (h1, h2). Similarly, one sees that
i ⊗k = k.
◀
▶Remark 2. It is worth spelling out the precise way in which we obtained the unit escrow
i = (i1, i2): its components consist of the equivalence class of (i1, i2) in the coend ⟨A, C⟩,
where we define

▶Remark 3. We recall what is the structure of a module over a monoid in M and of a
comodule over a comonoid: a module B over the monoid C is an object of M endowed with

▶Notation 4.4. Let C be a monoid in M and let B be a C-module; the action a : C⊗B →B
is usually denoted as an infix dot, a(x, b) = x.b for every x ∈C, b ∈B.
Dually, let B be an A-comodule; the coaction c : B →B ⊗A here shall be interpreted as
a map sending an element b ∈B in a pair (b′, y) of an element y ∈A and an element b′ = b′
y
in a new state depending on y.

of the monoid ⟨A, C⟩of Lemma 1 on the set of optics with common codomain [ A

Proof. Suppose given an escrow and an optic, as the following pairs:
 
h1
A
C ,
h2
C
A
!
 
o1
A
B ,
o2
C
B
!
(4.11)
Now define the action as follows:
h1
o1

c
h2
o2
(4.12)
using the monoid structure of C, comonoid structure of A, module and comodule structure
of B. We shall now prove the axioms of an action:

12
Escrows are optics
1. unitality axiom: the fact that i ⋊o = o for every optic o = (o1, o2) and for the unit escrow
i ∈⟨A, C⟩.
2. the action axiom, saying that (k ⊗h) ⋊o = k ⋊(h ⋊o) for escrows h, k and an optic o.
Axiom 1 follows from a simple string diagram deformation, using the unit axiom of the
co/monoid and co/action structures:
o1
a
c
o2
o1
o2
o1
o2
(4.13)
Similarly, axiom 2 follows from the co/associativity of the co/action and co/multiplication
applied to the following equality of wire diagrams, where on the left we have k ⋊(h ⋊o)
(slightly simplifying its structure to avoid cognitive overload), and on the right (k ⊗h) ⋊o:
k1
h1
o1
k2

This concludes the proof.

Unfortunately, one can readily notice that Theorem 5, albeit interesting, does not provide
the notion of composition we are looking for. Roughly speaking, the most evident problem
here is that our action does not even have the right type signature: B is present on both
sides in the inside of the resulting comb so that we do not even have a place to plug in our
witnesses now, that have signature C →B and B →A! To define a meaningful composition
representing B acting as an intermediary, we then need to resort to the underlying structure
of Tambara modules that we described in Definition 5.
The blanket assumption overall the following construction is that the object B ∈M is
simultaneously a module for the monoid C and a comodule for the comonoid A. Under this
assumption, we can model the situation where B acts as an intermediary in a transaction
between A and C.
▶Definition 6 (Vermittler optics). (From German, Vermittler = intermediary.) Given A, C
a comonoid and a monoid in M, and B an object which is at the same time a C-module and
an A-comodule, a Vermittler optic over B is an element of the hom-set Optic([ C
A ] ,
 A⊗B
C⊗B

).
We denote V(B; A, C) the set of Vermittler optics over B.
▶Proposition 7 (⟨C, A⟩‘acts’ on Vermittler optics). Given an escrow h in ⟨C, A⟩,
 
h1
C
A ,
h2
A
C
!
(4.15)
and an optic f : [ C
A ] →[ B
B ], we define a Vermittler map
◁: ⟨C, A⟩× Optic([ C
A ] , [ B
B ])
/ V(B; A, C)
(h, f) 
/ h ◁f
(4.16)
between the product of the hom-set of escrows A →C and the hom-set of the Vermittler
optics for B.
This map is partial, and moreover satisfies ‘action-like’ properties:

Genovese, Loregian and Palombi
13
if ϵ is the counit of the comonoid A, and η the unit of the monoid C, the equation
ϵ ◦(k ◁f) ◦η = f
(4.17)
holds.
◁is compatible with the action and coaction maps in the sense that the square
k◁f /
A⊗c

C⊗a
O
(n◦f◦m)⊗B
/
(4.18)
is commutative, where m : C ⊗C →C is the monoid multiplication, n : A →A ⊗A the
comonoid comultiplication, and c, a respectively the coaction and action of A, C on B.
Proof. Recall from [4, 4.13] that the hom-set Optic([ A
B ] , [ S
T ]) can be expressed as the end
Z
P
hom(P(A, B), P(S, T))
(4.19)
where P : Mop ×M →Set is a profunctor, and the category of integration is that of Tambara
modules [4, 4.1]. Now,
the fact that P is a Tambara module yields maps
αAC
[B] : P(C, A)
/ P(C ⊗B, A ⊗B)
(4.20)
that form a wedge in B; post-composition with these αAC
[B] and the universal wedge π•
defining Equation (4.19) yields maps
⟨C, A⟩
R
Q hom(Q(A, C), Q(C, A))

πP
/ hom(P(A, C), P(C, A))
αAC
[B],∗

hom(P(A, C), P(C ⊗B, A ⊗B))
(4.21)
forming a wedge in P. This in turn yields a unique map
˜α : ⟨C, A⟩
/ V(B; A, C)
(4.22)
by the universal property of the end that defines V(B; A, C).
The assumption that B is at the same time a module for the monoid C and a comodule
for the comonoid A entails the existence of an action map a : C ⊗B →B and a coaction
map c : B →A ⊗B, which plugged into the profunctor P yield
βAC
[B] = P(a, c) : P(B, B)
/ P(C ⊗B, A ⊗B).
(4.23)
In a similar fashion, post-composition with βAC
[B] , and the universal property of the end
defining domain and codomain of ˜β define such a map as
˜β : Optic([ C
A ] , [ B
B ])
/ V(B; A, C)
(4.24)

14
Escrows are optics
so that we obtain a cospan of maps
⟨C, A⟩
˜α

Optic([ C
A ] , [ B
B ])
˜β
/ V(B; A, C),
(4.25)
and we can consider its pullback Z (in Set, or inside a sufficiently cocomplete ambient
category). The diagonal in the pullback is the candidate partial function
Z
$
v
⟨C, A⟩× Optic([ C
A ] , [ B
B ])
◁
/ V(B; A, C)
(4.26)
having Z as its domain of definition. As such, k ◁f is defined as soon as ˜α(k) = ˜β(f),
and it equals any of these two elements.
The main intuition behind this construction is the following: the object Z is the maximal
subobject of the product ⟨C, A⟩× Optic([ C
A ] , [ B
B ]) with the property that the conjoint action
and coaction over B, and all actions given by the Tambara module structure maps αB, agree.
This yields a unique partial map
◁
that defines a partial action of the monoid ⟨A, C⟩
on the set of Vermittler optics over B.
It only remains to show that this map satisfies the commutativities of (4.17) and (4.18)
when the domain of ◁has been suitably defined as above; to argue equationally, with the
definition and the universal properties of Z and the hom-sets of optics, is certainly possible
but rather unwieldy. Instead, the following remark will give a graphical interpretation of the
above partial action that makes the action axioms almost tautological. This will conclude
the proof.

▶Remark 8. We can give a concise graphical representation of the action of the maps ˜α, ˜β
above:
the map ˜α acts sending an escrow
 
h1
C
A ,
h2
A
C
!
(4.27)
to the ‘trivial’ Vermittler optic obtained by tensoring with the identity arrow 1B:
α(h) =



h1
C
A
B
B
,
h2
A
C
B
B



(4.28)
the map ˜β acts sending an optic [ C
A ] →[ B
B ] to the Vermittler optic obtained by plugging
in the action and coaction map of A, C over B:
˜β(o) =
 
a
B
C
o1
A
,
o2
C
c
A
B
!
(4.29)

Genovese, Loregian and Palombi

The map ◁operates on the subset of the product ⟨A, C⟩× Optic([ A
C ] , [ B
B ]) where these
two actions coincide. Intuitively, this represents the fact that the escrow mediated by B
(represented by ˜β(o)) has the same effect of a standard escrow between A and C where B just
stays idle (represented by α(h)), which signifies that, when the mediated escrow is concluded,
B did not receive any goods or money from any of the two parties.
To conclude, one can readily verify the ‘action’ axioms using graphical calculus, namely
the fact that representing the Vermittler optic f as a pair (f1, f2) we can follow the chain of
equalities
f1
f2
a
c
=
a
a
f1
f2
c
c
=
a
a
f1
f2
c
c
=
f1
f2
This established (4.18). Finally, that plugging the counit and unit of A and C at the sides of
the optic f, we get back the original optic:
f1
f2
=
f1
f2
(4.30)
This establishes (4.17).

Conclusion and future Work
In this work, we defined a formalism for escrow trades based on optics.
We moreover
investigated various ways of chaining escrows together, which can be considered more or less
convenient depending on externalities such as the tax regime the participating agents are in.
As a direction of future work, we would like to obtain an alternative formalization of the
same ideas relying on new techniques such as the ones presented in [12], that allow to model
processes (such as opening an escrow vault) and passing of resources as separated interactive
layers.
