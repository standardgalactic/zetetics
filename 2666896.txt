 1. Introduction
 Observations now probe the properties of galaxy populations over 
 the age of the Universe (e.g. Steidel et al. 1996; Ellis et al. 1996
 Adelberger et al. 1998). Furthermore, we can look forward to a m
 study of the high redshift Universe with the many instruments 
 sioned on the growing generation of new 8 m class telescopes. Over
 probed by these observations the conventional cold-dark-matter-d
 of structure formation predict very strong evolution of the distrib
 ter. Thus the process of galaxy formation will be greatly influenc
 largely determined by the dynamical evolution of the dark matte

 To convert the calculated star formation histories of each galaxy into observ

 Chariot (1993, 2000) together with the three-dimensional dust model of Ferrar
 (1999). For the former, we adopt the initial mass function of the solar neighbou
 as parametrized by Kennicutt (1983) and for the latter we adopt their Milk

 3. Redshift zero properties
 The response of this galaxy formation model to parameter changes has been explored
 extensively in Cole et al. (2000). They also present a reference model for a ACDM
 cosmology (with i?o ? 0-3, A) = 0.7 and h = 0.7), which reproduces many of the low
 redshift properties of the observed galaxy distribution. To illustrate the behaviour

 the bright disc galaxies at redshift z = 1 are destined to become elliptical galaxies
 at the present day.
 Given these gross changes it is clear that the merger and star formation histories
 depicted in figure 5, while being typical for disc galaxies selected at redshift z = 0,
 will not be representative of the fate of disc galaxies selected at an earlier time. This
 is illustrated in figure 7, which shows the star formation and merger histories of a
 random sample of z = 1, bright (L > L*) disc-dominated galaxies. Many of the
 bright disc galaxies at redshift z = 1 are destined to undergo quite strong mergers
 before the present.

 disc mass of the descendant at z = 0 to that of the largest progenitor disc at redshift
 z ? \. The corresponding change in the rest-frame 5-band magnitude of the disc
 is shown in figure 8b. As in figure 6a we see that the mean disc mass has increased
 by a factor of 2 to 3 over this time-span, but now there is an additional population
 of discs whose masses have decreased dramatically due to mergers that result in
 bulge-dominated galaxies at the present day. In figure 8b we see that the typical disc
 luminosity of this sample is 1-1.5 mag brighter at z = 1 than at z ? 0. The sign of
 this evolution is opposite to that for the sample selected at redshift z = 0. This can
 be understood in terms of the varied and non-monotonic evolution of the individual
 galaxy luminosities together with the fact that we have selected the brightest objec
 at one or other epoch. Thus, the galaxies will tend to be brightest at the epoch
 which they are selected.

 for a subsample of disc-dominated galaxies. In both cases there is a steady monotonic
 evolution of the characteristic galaxy stellar mass.
 (c) Disc scale-lengths
 A prediction that is at the very heart of hierarchical galaxy formation is that
 galaxies were physically smaller in the past. This is quantified for our ylCDM model
 by the evolving distributions of disc scale-lengths shown in figure 11.
 Since the predicted distributions are broad and dependent on luminosity as well
 as redshift, one has to be careful to match selection criteria when comparing with
 observational results. This has been done in figure 12, which shows the model distri?
 bution of the scaled disc scale-length Cr, = Rdisc/Mlx[m as a function of redshift for
 a sample chosen to match the observational sample analysed by Brinchmann (1999).
 The line on the plot is a fit to the observed data and indicates that the evolution
 detected in the scale-length distribution is broadly consistent with the expectations
 of this hierarchical model.

 between the bright galaxies, as is done in the traditional pure luminosity evolution
 models (e.g. Campos & Shanks 1997), one would falsely infer that present-day disc
 galaxies have varied very little in luminosity since z = 1. The generic prediction of
 hierarchical galaxy formation, that the disc scale-lengths should be smaller at high
 redshift, has been detected and is at the level predicted by such models.
