ABSTRACT
Large-scale diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results on text-to-image
synthesis (T2I) tasks. Despite their ability to generate high-quality yet creative
images, we observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities are
still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple
objects. Attribute-binding requires the model to associate objects with the correct
attribute descriptions, and compositional skills require the model to combine and
generate multiple concepts into a single image. In this work, we improve these
two aspects of T2I models to achieve more accurate image compositions. To
do this, we incorporate linguistic structures with the diffusion guidance process
based on the controllable properties of manipulating cross-attention layers in
diffusion-based T2I models. We observe that keys and values in cross-attention
layers have strong semantic meanings associated with object layouts and content.
Therefore, by manipulating the cross-attention representations based on linguistic
insights, we can better preserve the compositional semantics in the generated image.
Built upon Stable Diffusion, a SOTA T2I model, our structured cross-attention
design is efficient that requires no additional training samples. We achieve better
compositional skills in qualitative and quantitative results, leading to a significant
5-8% advantage in head-to-head user comparison studies. Lastly, we conduct an
in-depth analysis to reveal potential causes of incorrect image compositions and
justify the properties of cross-attention layers in the generation process.

INTRODUCTION
Text-to-Image Synthesis (T2I) is to generate natural and faithful images given a text prompt as input.
Recently, there has been a significant advancement in the quality of generated images by extremely
large-scale vision-language models, such as DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022), Imagen (Saharia
et al., 2022), and Parti (Yu et al., 2022). In particular, Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) is the
state-of-the-art open-source implementation showing superior evaluation metric gains after training
over billions of text-image pairs.
In addition to generating high-fidelity images, the ability to compose multiple objects into a coherent
scene is also essential. Given a text prompt from the user end, T2I models need to generate an image
that contains all necessary visual concepts as mentioned in the text. Achieving such ability requires
the model to understand both the full prompt and individual linguistic concepts from the prompt.
As a result, the model should be able to combine multiple concepts and generate novel objects that
have never been included in the training data. In this work, we mainly focus on improving the
compositionality of the generation process, as it is essential to achieve controllable and generalized
text-to-image synthesis with multiple objects in a complex scene.
Attribute binding is a critical compositionality challenge (Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022) to
existing large-scale diffusion-based models. Despite the improvements in generating multiple objects
in the same scene, existing models still fail when given a prompt such as “a brown bench in front of a
white building” (see Fig. 1). The output images contains “a white bench” and “a brown building”
instead, potentially due to strong training set bias or imprecise language understanding. From a
practical perspective, explaining and solving such a two-object binding challenge is a primary step to
understanding more complex prompts with multiple objects. Therefore, how to bind the attributes

to the correct objects is a fundamental problem for a more complicated and reliable compositional
generation. While previous work has addressed compositional T2I (Park et al., 2021), our work
tackles open-domain foreground objects with counterfactual attributes, such as color and materials.
Even though state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models are trained on large-scale text-image datasets, they
can still suffer from inaccurate results for simple prompts similar to the example above. Hence,
we are motivated to seek an alternative, data-efficient method to improve the compositionality. We
observe that the attribute-object relation pairs can be obtained as text spans for free from the parsing
tree of the sentence. Therefore, we propose to combine the structured representations of prompts,
such as a constituency tree or a scene graph, with the diffusion guidance process. Text spans only
depict limited regions of the whole image. Conventionally, we need spatial information such as
coordinates (Yang et al., 2022) as input to map their semantics into corresponding images. However,
coordinate inputs cannot be interpreted by T2I models. Instead, we make use of the observations that
attention maps provide free token-region associations in trained T2I models (Hertz et al., 2022). By
modifying the key-value pairs in cross-attention layers, we manage to map the encoding of each text
span into attended regions in 2D image space.
In this work, we discover similar observations in Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) and utilize
the property to build structured cross-attention guidance. Specifically, we use language parsers to
obtain hierarchical structures from the prompts. We extract text spans across all levels, including
visual concepts or entities, and encode them separately to disentangle the attribute-object pairs from
each other. Compared to using a single sequence of text embedding for guidance, we improve the
compositionality by multiple sequences where each emphasizes an entity or a union of entities from
multiple hierarchies in the structured language representations. We refer to our method as Structured
Diffusion Guidance (StructureDiffusion). Our contributions can be summarized as three-fold:
• We propose an intuitive and effective method to improve compositional text-to-image
synthesis by utilizing structured representations of language inputs. Our method is efficient
and training-free that requires no additional training samples.
• Experimental results show that our method achieves more accurate attribute binding and
compositionality in the generated images. We also propose a benchmark named Attribute
Binding Contrast set (ABC-6K) to measure the compositional skills of T2I models.
• We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to identify the causes of incorrect attribute
binding, which points out future directions in improving the faithfulness and compositional-
ity of text-to-image synthesis.

DIFFUSION MODELS & STRUCTURED GUIDANCE
In this section, we propose a simple yet effective approach incorporating structured language repre-
sentations into the cross-attention layers. We briefly introduce the Stable Diffusion model and its
critical components in Sec. 2.1. Then, we present our method in detail in Sec. 2.2.
2.1
BACKGROUND
Stable Diffusion
We implement our approach and experiments on the state-of-the-art T2I model,
Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022). It is a two-stage method that consists of an autoencoder
and a diffusion model. The pre-trained autoencoder encodes images as lower-resolution latent maps
for diffusion training. During inference, it decodes generated outputs from the diffusion model into
images. The diffusion model generates lower-resolution latent maps based on a random Gaussian
noise input zT . Given zT , it outputs a noise estimation ϵ at each step t and subtracts it from zt.
The final noise-free latent map prediction z0 is fed into the autoencoder to generate images. Stable
Diffusion adopts a modified UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) for noise estimation and a frozen CLIP
text encoder (Radford et al., 2021) to encode text inputs as embedding sequences. The interactions
between the image space and the textual embeddings are achieved through multiple cross-attention
layers in both downsampling and upsampling blocks.
CLIP Text Encoder
Given an input prompt P, the CLIP encoder encodes it as a sequence of
embeddings Wp = CLIPtext(P) where cp is the embedding dimension and l is the sequence length.
Our key observation is that the contextualization of CLIP embeddings is a potential cause of incorrect
attribute binding. Due to the causal attention masks, tokens in the later part of a sequence are blended
with the token semantics before them. For example, When the user indicates some rare color for the
second object (e.g. “a yellow apple and red bananas”), Stable Diffusion tends to generate “banana” in
“yellow”, as the embeddings of “yellow” is attended by token “banana”.
Cross Attention Layers
The cross-attention layers take the embedding sequences from the CLIP
text encoder and fuse them with latent feature maps to achieve classifier-free guidance. Denote a 2D
feature map X t, it is projected into queries by a linear layer fQ(·) and reshaped as Qt ∈R(n,h×w,d)
where n denotes the number of attention heads, d is the feature dimension. Similarly Wp is projected
as keys and values Kp, Vp ∈R(n,l,d) by linear layers fK(·), fV (·). The attention maps refer to the
product between queries and keys, denoted as a function fM(·)

demonstration purposes. Note that noun phrases at multiple hierarchies are extracted and encoded
through the frozen CLIP text encoder and projected to value vectors.
Cross Attention Controls
Hertz et al. (2022) observes that the spatial layouts depend on the cross
attention maps in Imagen Saharia et al. (2022). These maps control the layout and structure of
generated images, while the values contain rich semantics mapped into attended regions. Therefore,
we assume that the image layout and content can be disentangled by controlling attention maps and
values separately.
2.2
STRUCTURED DIFFUSION GUIDANCE
Given the challenging prompts in Fig. 1, the attribute-object pairs are available for free1 in many
structured representations, such as a constituency tree or a scene graph. We seek an implicit way of
combining language structures with the cross-attention layers. As is shown in Fig. 3, we can extract
multiple noun phrases (NPs) and map their semantics into corresponding regions. Since Mt provides
natural token-region associations (see Fig. 2), we can apply it to multiple values from different NPs
to achieve region-wise semantic guidance.
Specifically, given a parser ξ(·), we first extract a collection of concepts from all hierarchical levels
as C = {c1, c2, . . . , ck}. For constituency parsing, we extract all NPs from the tree structure (see
Fig.3 left). For the scene graphs, we extract objects and their relations with another object as text
segments. We encode each NP separately:
W = [Wp,W1, W2, . . . , Wk], Wi = CLIPtext(ci), i = 1, . . . k.
(2)
The embedding sequence Wi is realigned with Wp as shown in the middle of Fig. 3. Embeddings
between ⟨bos⟩and ⟨pad⟩are inserted into Wp to create a new sequence, denoted as Wi. We use
Wp to obtain Kp and M t as in Eq. 1, assuming that the full-prompt key is able to generate layouts
without missing objects. We obtain a set of values from W and multiply each with M t to achieve a
conjunction of k NPs in C:
V = [fV (Wp), fV (W1), . . . , fV (Wk)] = [Vp, V1, . . . , Vk].

Compared to using fV (Wp) only, Eq. 4 does not modify the image layout or composition since M t

(see Appendix C). However, Stable Diffusion tends to omit objects in generated images (Fig. 1),

EXPERIMENT
3.1
EXPERIMENT SETTINGS
Datasets
To address attribute binding and compositional generation, we propose a new benchmark,
Attribute Binding Contrast set (ABC-6K). It consists of natural prompts from MSCOCO where each
contains at least two color words modifying different objects. We also switch the position of two
color words to create a contrast caption (Gardner et al., 2020). We end up with 6.4K captions or 3.2K
contrastive pairs. In addition to natural compositional prompts, we challenge our method with less
detailed prompts that conjunct two concepts together. These prompts follow the sentence pattern of
“a red apple and a yellow banana” and conjunct two objects with their attribute descriptions. We refer
to this set of prompts as Concept Conjunction 500 (CC-500). We also evaluate our method on 10K
randomly sampled captions from MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014). We show that our method generalizes
beyond attribute binding and introduces no quality degradation for general prompts.
Evaluation Metrics
We mainly rely on human evaluations for compositional prompts and concept
conjunction (ABC-6K & CC-500). We ask annotators to compare two generated images, from Stable
Diffusion and our method respectively, and indicate which image demonstrates better image-text
alignment or image fidelity. For image fidelity, we ask the annotators “Regardless of the text, which
image is more realistic and natural?”. We also investigate an automatic evaluation metric for image
compositions, i.e., using a SOTA phrase grounding model GLIP (Li et al., 2022) to match phrase-
object pairs. As for system-level evaluation, we follow previous work to utilize Inception Score (IS)
(Salimans et al., 2016), Fre´chet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) and CLIP R-precision
(R-prec.) (Park et al., 2021). IS and FID mainly measure the image bank’s systematic quality and
diversity, while R-prec measures image-level alignment.

two images per prompt for our method and Stable Diffusion, involving around 12K image pairs to
compare. Then, we filter out 20% of the most similar pairs and then randomly sampled 1500 pairs for
human evaluations. As shown in Table 1, annotators indicate around a 42% chance of our method
winning the comparison, 7% higher than losing the comparison. There is still a 22% of chance that
our images are tied with images from Stable Diffusion.
We show qualitative examples characterizing three different perspectives in Fig. 4. Our method
fills in the correct color for different parts of an object or different objects, as shown in the first
two examples. The third example demonstrates that our method can mitigate the issue of “missing
objects”. Among the 42% winning cases, there are 31% for “fewer missing objects”, 14.1% for
“better-matched colors”, and 54.8% for “other attributes or details” as indicated by annotators. The
results certify that the improvement goes beyond colors to component completeness and fine-grained
details. More qualitative examples characterizing all three aspects can be found in Fig. 14 in the
Appendix.
3.3
CONCEPT CONJUNCTION
Here we address challenging concept conjunction prompts and evaluate our method on CC-500. Apart
from Stable Diffusion, we also compare to Composable Diffusion (Liu et al., 2022) implemented on
top of Stable Diffusion. For Composable Diffusion, we separate the prompts into text segments by the
keyword “and” and feed each span into an independent diffusion process. We generate three images
per prompt and use all images for human evaluation for Stable Diffusion. We randomly sampled 600
images for comparison to Composable Diffusion.

method prevents the green color from invading the bird or apple. (b) Missing objects: our method

As shown in Table 1, our method outperforms Stable Diffusion by around 4.1% and Composable
Diffusion by 16.4% in terms of image-text alignment. We also observe that our method enhances
some fine-grained details in the generated images, leading to a 7.2% improvement in image fidelity
when compared with Stable Diffusion. We observe that images from composable diffusion can be
oversaturated with unnatural visual textures and layouts, which could be the reason for StructureDif-
fusion to have high win rate in image fidelity. As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 13. Our approach prevents
color bleeding (left), missing objects (right) and strengthens details (right).
To further quantify the text-image alignment, we consider both human annotations and automatic
evaluations. For each object mentioned in the prompt, we ask annotators whether the object exists
in the image and whether it is in the correct color. We also apply a state-of-the-art detection model
GLIP (Li et al., 2022) to ground each “a [color] [object]” phrase into bounding boxes. We report
the percentage of images that contain incomplete objects / complete objects / complete objects with
correct colors in Table 2. StructureDiffusion improves the compositionality by 3.5% based on human
annotations while only 0.2% based on GLIP. We discover that humans disagree with GLIP for more
than 50% of the images, as entailed by the low consistency rate. Previous work also suggests the
deficiency of large pre-trained models in compositional understanding (Thrush et al., 2022).

sampled MSCOCO captions. Stable Diffusion obtains 39.9 IS, 18.0 FID and 72.2 R-Precision. Our
method achieves 40.9 IS, 17.9 FID and 72.3 R-Precision. StructureDiffusion maintains the image
fidelity and diversity as indicated in the comparable IS/FID/R-Prec scores.
3.5
SCENE GRAPH INPUT
We show that our method is not limited to constituency parsing but can also be extended to other
structured representations, such as scene graphs. As shown in Fig. 6, we first adopt the scene graph
parser (Wu et al., 2019) and obtain a graph like the ones next to each image from the input prompt.
The parser returns basic entities and their relations in between. We extract text spans of basic entities
with their attributes attached and text spans that include two related entities. We provide examples
in Appendix 3 and make comparison to the constituency parser. Similarly, we encode these spans
separately and re-align each with the entire prompt encoding sequence. On MS-COCO, the scene
graph parser setting maintains the image quality with 39.2 IS, 17.9 FID, and 72.0 R-Precision. When
compared to Stable Diffusion on ABC-6K, the scene graph parser achieves 34.2%-32.9%-32.9%
Win-Lose-Tie in image-text alignment and 34.5%-32.5%-33.0% Win-Lose-Tie in image fidelity. As
for CC-500, the scene graph parser leads to the same output images due to the same text spans. We
refer to Table 3 and Fig. 12 for more results and comparison.

ABLATION STUDY
4.1
RE-ALIGNING SEQUENCE
In Section 2, we describe a method to realign the encoding of a text span back into the sequence of
the full prompt. Since the noun-phrase text spans are shorter than the full sequence, re-alignment
ensures that each token’s value vector corresponds to the correct attention map. On the other hand,
naively expanding the span to the length of the full sequence degrades the image quality by ∼2 IS /
FID (37.5 IS, 19.8 FID) compared to images with re-alignment or Stable Diffusion.

4.2
CONTEXTUALIZED TEXT EMBEDDINGS
One limitation brought by our StructureDiffusion is that the cross-attention computation costs increase
by the number of noun phrases. Yet we noticed that most of the attention maps are computed from
padding embeddings, as Stable Diffusion adopts CLIP text encoders and automatically pads the
sequence to 77 tokens. We conjecture that not all padding tokens are necessary for generating
high-quality images. As is shown in Fig. 7, we study four different patterns of token embeddings.
We discover that leaving the nearest padding embeddings maintains a similar IS / FID score as the
full sequence. Further removing this padding embedding results in apparent degradation. While only
using the nearest padding embedding results in the worst image quality, we find that the high-level
image layout and semantics are preserved (see bottom right of Fig. 7). This phenomenon indicates
that the padding embeddings are fully contextualized with the full prompt semantics. This also
justifies our re-alignment operation that preserves padding embeddings of the main sequence Wfull.

RELATED WORK
Text-to-Image Synthesis
The diffusion model is an emerging type of model that generate high-
quality images with a much more stable training process (Song & Ermon, 2019; Ho et al., 2020).
Rombach et al. (2022) proposes to encode an image with an autoencoder and then leverage a diffusion
model to generate continuous feature maps in the latent space. Stable Diffusion Rombach et al.
(2022) adopts similar architecture but is trained on large-scale image-text datasets with fixed CLIP
text encoder. Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) addresses the importance of language understanding by
using a frozen T5 encoder (Raffel et al., 2020), a dedicated large language model. We mainly focus
on diffusion models and conduct our experiments on Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), the
SOTA open-sourced T2I model.
Compositional Generation
The compositional or controllable generation has been an essential
direction for T2I models to understand and disentangle basic concepts in the generation process. As
text inputs are relatively weak conditions, previous work leverage layout or scene graph to enhance
compositionality (Johnson et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2022; Gafni et al., 2022). More
recently, Liu et al. (2022) proposes an approach where the concept conjunctions are achieved by
adding estimated scores from a parallel set of diffusion processes. In contrast, our method can be
directly merged into the cross-attention layers with much less computational overhead.
Diffusion Guidance
Ho & Salimans (2022) develops classifier-free guidance where a single
diffusion model is jointly trained under conditional and unconditional inputs. Most large-scale SOTA
models, including autoregressive ones, adopt this technique for flexible and improved conditional
synthesis results (Rombach et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Gafni et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022;
Saharia et al., 2022). Hertz et al. (2022) discovers unique properties of cross attention maps on
Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) and achieves structure-preserving image editing by manipulating these
maps. We observe similar properties in Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) but propose a
different algorithm for fine-grained, compositional text-to-image generation.

CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a training-free method for compositional text-to-image generation. First,
we observe that existing large-scale T2I diffusion models can still struggle in compositional image
synthesis. We address this challenge by explicitly focusing on binding objects with the correct
attributes. Second, we propose structured diffusion guidance incorporating language structures into
the cross-attention layers. We propose two simple techniques to align the structured encoding with
the attention maps. Using our structured guidance on Stable Diffusion, attributes can be bound more
accurately while maintaining the overall image quality and diversity. In addition, we justify our
approach by conducting an in-depth analysis of the frozen language encoder and attention maps.
Future work may explore explicit approaches to generate plausible image layouts without missing
components. We hope that our approach accelerates the development of interpretable and efficient
methods for diffusion-based text-to-image models.

RELATED WORK
Text-to-Image Synthesis
There are mainly three types of models for text-to-image synthesis:
GAN-based (Tao et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2020; El-Nouby et al., 2019),
autoregressive (Gu et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2022) and diffusion models (Liu et al.,
2021b; Nichol et al., 2021; Ruiz et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2021) proposes XMC-GAN, a one-stage
GAN that employs multiple contrastive losses between image-image, image-text, and region-token
pairs. More recently, LAFITE (Zhou et al., 2022) enables language-free training by constructing
pseudo image-text feature pairs using CLIP (Radford et al., 2021). As for autoregressive models,
DALL-E adopts VQ-VAE to quantize image patches into tokens and then uses a transformer to
generate discrete tokens sequentially (Ramesh et al., 2021). Parti (Yu et al., 2022) and Make-A-Scene
(Gafni et al., 2022) both leverage classifier-free guidance to improve controllability. As for diffusion
models, Gu et al. (2022a) concatenates VQ-VAE with the diffusion model and shows that the diffusion
process can operate in discrete latent space. DALL-E 2 adopts the CLIP text encoder so that the
diffusion process inverts the textual features into images (Ramesh et al., 2022).
Structured Representations for Vision and Language
Inferring shared structures across language
and vision has been a long-term pursuit in unifying these modalities (Schuster et al., 2015; Johnson
et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2020; Lou et al., 2022). Wu et al. (2019) utilizes the structure from semantic
parsing in a visual-semantic embedding framework to facilitate embedding learning. Wan et al. (2021)
proposes a new task in which the goal is to learn a joint structure between semantic parsing and image
regions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt in T2I to incorporate language
structures into the image synthesizing process.
Diffusion Guidance
To convert an unconditional diffusion model into a class-conditional one,
Dhariwal & Nichol (2021) input the noisy image from each step into a classifier and calculate the
classification loss. The loss can be back-propagated to the image space to provide a gradient that
marginalizes the score estimation from the log of conditional probability. Similarly, in the T2I
subdomain, Liu et al. (2021b) and Nichol et al. (2021) apply a noisy CLIP model to measure the
cosine similarity between text prompts and noisy images.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Throughout the experiments, we implement our method upon Stable Diffusion v1.4. For all compar-
isons between our method and Stable Diffusion, we fix the seed to generate the same initial Gaussian
map and use 50 diffusion steps with PLMS sampling (Liu et al., 2021a). We fix the guidance scale to
7.5 and equally weight the key-value matrices in cross-attention layers if not otherwise specified. We
do not add hand-crafted prompts such as “a photo of” to the text input. We use the Stanza Library (Qi
et al., 2020) for constituency parsing and obtain noun phrases if not otherwise specified.
C
VISUALIZATION OF ATTENTION MAPS
In this section, we demonstrate the visualization of cross-attention maps to support our assumptions
and claims in Sec. 2. As is shown in Fig. 8, the attention maps of Stable Diffusion and our method

have similar spatial distribution and highlights throughout the diffusion process. This phenomenon
supports our assumption in Sec. 2.2 that the attention map Mt is unchanged even with multiple values
in each cross-attention layer. We can observe a similar phenomenon in Fig. 9 except that our method
accelerates the formation of interpretable attentions for both “green” and “clock” tokens.
Fig. 8, 9 also justify our claim that values represent rich textual semantics mapped to the image
space as contents. For instance, our method parses the prompt in Fig. 8 into “A long narrow yellow
kitchen” and “black and white floor tiles”, encodes and aligns them separately to form V. Empirically,
these operations enhance the semantics of “yellow” and “black and white” separately and mitigate
“yellow” being blended into “black and white”. This explains the disappearance of color leakage in
our image compared to Stable Diffusion. Though one may attribute the leakage to incorrect attention
distribution of the “yellow” token, we argue that this is not the critical reason. Despite the attention
maps of “yellow” from our method slightly highlighting the “floor tile” regions, we cannot observe
any yellow in our generated image. This proves that inaccurate attention distributions contribute little
to the final image content. In addition, we also show in Fig. 10 that using multiple Keys is able to
rectify the image layouts to mitigate missing object issues. The sheep-like attention maps in the third
row verify the proposed variants of our method for concept conjunctions.

ABLATION STUDY

A CASE STUDY OF ATTRIBUTE BINDING
Here, we present a case study to show evidence of two root causes of incorrect attribute binding. The
first one is the contextualized token embeddings due to causal attention masks. As is shown on the
left side of Fig. 11, we first encode two different prompts with a shared component, e.g. “a red apple”
as the naive one and “a green bag and a red apple”. Using the encoding sequence of the naive prompt,

Figure 11: Examples showing the potential root causes of incorrect attribute binding. Left: The large
green regions in the second image prove that the hidden state’s output of token “red” is contextualized
with token “green” before it. Right: Visualization of attention maps showing that the semantics from
the token “bird” is mistakenly attended to the mouth region of the bear. The final image shows the
unnatural beak-like shape of the bear.
we are able to get an image of red apple only. It is reasonable to assume that the yellow
green regions are natural results of learning from authentic apple images. Then, we replace the tokens
of the naive prompt with embeddings of the same token from the more complicated prompt. We use
the same gaussian noise as initialization and generate an unnatural image with a solid green region (in
the yellow bounding box). This result proves that the token “red” is contaminated with the semantics
of “green” before it and explains some images with color leakage problems (e.g., Fig. 1).
The second reason attributes to inaccurate attention maps. In Fig. 11 (right), we visualize five cross-
attention maps (averaged across attention heads) from both downsample and upsampling blocks. The
attention maps show the salient regions corresponding to the token “bird”. These maps demonstrate
highlighted regions in the bottom left corner where the bird is located in the final image. Despite the
interpretable structures, the maps also show saliency around the mouth region of the bear across all
five layers. Thus, the inaccurate attention maps lead to a beak-like mouth of the bear in the image.
D.2
COMPARISON OF PARSERS
In this subsection, we compare the difference between using a constituency parser and a scene graph
parser to obtain text spans and generate images. Table 3 compares the extracted text spans using
constituency parser and scene graph parser. Example 0 shows that both parsers end up with the same
results for CC-500 prompts. For Example 1-4, the scene graph parser generates more spans than the
constituency parser. We notice that concepts in the middle of the sentence appear more often in these
spans than other noun tokens, like “egg” or “red sauce” in Example 3. This imbalance potentially
explains why the “egg” looks more highlighted in Fig. 12 (bottom left). On the other hand, “orange
slices” appear more often in constituency parsing results, leading to better “orange” textures in the
generated image. Similar observations can be made in Example 2, where “green pole” is emphasized
more often by the constituency parser.
E
LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
There are several limitations of our work. First of all, our method depends on an external parsing
function that may not be perfect. We adopt the commonly used Stanza Library Qi et al. (2020) for
constituency parsing. The parsing function can be replaced with a more advanced learning-based
method for improvement. Secondly, our method mainly focuses on compositional T2I neglecting any

Table 3: Comparison between the constituency parser and scene graph parser. For CC-500 prompts,
both parsers end up with the same results. As for general prompts, scene graph parser tends to
generate more text spans with middle concepts appearing multiple times across different spans.

style descriptions. The parsing mechanism may categorize a style description, e.g. “in Van Gogh
style” as a separate noun phrase that cannot be grounded in the image space. In addition, we discover
that StructureDiffusion tends to generate similar images as Stable Diffusion. Thus we filtered out 20%
of most similar image pairs in Table 1, considering the efficiency of human evaluation. Therefore, the
improvement could be compromised when evaluated on the full set of generated images. Future work
may focus on devising explicit methods to associate attributes to objects using spatial information as
input. For example, how to make a text-to-image synthesis model interpret coordinate information
with limited fine-tuning or prompt tuning steps would be an appealing direction.
