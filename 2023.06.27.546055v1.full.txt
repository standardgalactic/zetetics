Abstract
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster combines surprisingly sophisticated behaviour with a
highly tractable nervous system. A large part of the fly’s success as a model organism in
modern neuroscience stems from the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular
genetic and digital resources. As presented in our FlyWire companion paper1, this now
includes the first full brain connectome of an adult animal. Here we report the systematic and
hierarchical annotation of this ~130,000-neuron connectome including neuronal classes, cell
types and developmental units (hemilineages). This enables any researcher to navigate this
huge dataset and find systems and neurons of interest, linked to the literature through the
Virtual Fly Brain database2. Crucially, this resource includes 4,179 cell types of which 3,166
consensus cell types are robustly defined by comparison with a second dataset, the
“hemibrain” connectome3. Comparative analysis showed that cell type counts and strong
connections were largely stable, but connection weights were surprisingly variable within and
across animals. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for connectome interpretation:
connections stronger than 10 unitary synapses or providing >1% of the input to a target cell
are highly conserved. Some cell types showed increased variability across connectomes: the
most common cell type in the mushroom body, required for learning and memory, is almost
twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. We find evidence for functional
homeostasis
through
adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while
maintaining the excitation-inhibition ratio. Finally, and surprisingly, about one third of the cell
types recorded in the hemibrain connectome could not be robustly identified in the FlyWire
connectome, cautioning against defining cell types based on single connectomes. We
propose that a cell type should be robust to inter-individual variation, and therefore defined
as a group of cells that are more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in
the same brain. We show that this new definition can be consistently applied to whole
connectome datasets. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and

Main
The adult fruit fly represents the current frontier for whole brain connectomics. With 127,978
neurons, the newly completed full adult female brain connectome is intermediate in log scale
between the first connectome of C. elegans (302 neurons4,5) and the mouse (10^8 neurons),
a desirable but currently intractable target6. The availability of a complete adult fly brain
connectome now allows brain-spanning circuits to be mapped and linked to circuit dynamics
and behaviour as has long been possible for the nematode and more recently the Drosophila
larva (3016 neurons7). However the adult fly has richer behaviour, including complex motor
control while walking or in flight8–10, courtship behaviour11,12, involved decision making13,14,
flexible associative memory15–21, spatial learning22,23 and complex24–28 multisensory29–31
navigation.
The FlyWire connectome reported in our companion paper1 is by some margin the largest
and most complex yet obtained. The full connectome, derived from the ~100 teravoxel FAFB
whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume32, can be represented as a graph with
127,978 nodes and ~16.5M weighted edges. In this paper we formulate and answer a
number of key questions essential to interpreting connectomes at this scale: 1) How do we
know which edges are important? 2) How can we simplify the connectome graph to aid
automated or human analysis? 3) To what extent is this connectome a snapshot of a single
brain or representative of this species as a whole; or to put it more provocatively, have we
collected a snowflake? These questions are inextricably linked with connectome annotation
and cell type identification33,34 within and across datasets.
At the most basic level, navigating this connectome would be extremely challenging without
a comprehensive system of annotations, which we now provide. Our annotations provide an
indexed and hierarchical human-readable parts list33,35, allowing biologists to explore their
systems and neurons of interest. Connectome annotation is also crucial to ensuring data
quality since it inevitably reveals segmentation errors that must be corrected. Furthermore,
there is a rich history in Drosophila of probing the circuit basis of a wide range of innate and
learned behaviours as well as their developmental genetic origins; realising the full potential
of this dataset is only possible by cross-identifying cell types within the connectome with
those previously characterised in the published and in-progress literature. This paper reports
this key component of the connectome together with the open source tools and resources
we have generated. Because the annotation and proofreading of the connectome are

FlyWire resource.
Comparison with the partial hemibrain connectome3 confirmed that the majority of fly cell
types are highly stereotyped, as well defining simple and general heuristics for which
connections within a connectome are reliable and therefore more likely to be functional.
However, this also revealed unexpected variability in some cell types and demonstrated that
many cell types originally reported in the hemibrain could not be reliably re-identified. This
discovery necessitated the development and application of a new robust approach for
defining cell types jointly across connectomics datasets. Overall, this effort lays the
foundation both for deep interrogation of current and anticipated fly connectomes from
normal individuals, but also future studies of sexual dimorphism, experience-dependent
plasticity, development and disease at whole brain scale.
Results
Hierarchical annotation of a connectome
Annotations defining different kinds of neurons are key to exploring and interpreting any
connectome; but with the FlyWire connectome now exceeding the 100,000 neuron mark,
they are also both of increased significance and more challenging to generate. We defined a
comprehensive, systematic, and hierarchical set of annotations, based on the anatomical
organisation of the brain (Figure 1; Supplemental Video 1+2), as well as the developmental
origin and coarse morphology of neurons (Figure 2). Building on these as well as mapping to
pre-existing datasets, we then defined a set of consensus terminal cell types intended to
capture the finest level of organisation that is reproducible across brains (Figure 3). For the
connectome version that we report jointly with Dorkenwald et al.1 the central brain can be
considered a finished connectome by virtue of multiple rounds of synergistic proofreading
and annotation; in contrast, the newly proofread optic lobes will likely see further updates
through additional rounds of validation. For this reason although coarser annotations are
provided brainwide, our finest scale cell typing focuses on neurons with processes in the
central brain. Nevertheless this represents most cell types in the fly brain; while intrinsic
neurons of the optic lobe are the majority of neurons in the fly brain, their highly parallel
architecture means they contain only about 200 cell types36,37, or approximately 20x fewer
than the central brain.
We first collected and curated basic metadata for every neuron in the dataset
including soma position and side and exit or entry nerve for afferent and efferent neurons
(Figure 1). Our group also predicted neurotransmitter identity for all neurons as reported

elsewhere38. We then defined a hierarchy of four levels: flow →superclass →class →cell
type which provide salient labels at different granularities (Figure 1A; Supplemental Table
S1; Figure S1).
The first two levels, flow and superclass, were densely annotated: every neuron is
either afferent, efferent or intrinsic to the brain (flow) and falls into one of the 9 superclasses:
sensory
(periphery→brain),
motor
(brain→periphery),
endocrine
(brain→ring
gland),
ascending (ventral nerve cord→brain), descending (brain→ventral nerve cord), visual
projection (optic lobes→central brain), visual centrifugal (central brain→optic lobes), or
intrinsic to the optic lobes or the central brain (Figure 1B, Supplemental Table S2), A
mapping to the virtualflybrain.org2 database allows cross-referencing neuron/types with other
publications (see Methods for details).

The class field contains pre-existing neurobiological groupings from the literature
(e.g. for central complex neurons; see Supplemental Table S3) and is sparsely annotated
(40% of the central brain), in large part because past research has favoured some brain
areas over others. Finally, over half (57%) of the neurons associated with the central brain
(i.e. both inputs to the central brain as well as intrinsic neurons with their cell bodies in the
central brain) were given a terminal cell type most of which could be linked to at least one
report in the literature (Figure 1C, see Methods for details). The remaining neurons are
typeable even if they cannot be unambiguously linked to previously reported cell types, and
we provide a path for this below (“Toward multi-connectome cell typing”). In total, we
collected over 720k annotations for all 127,978 neurons; all are available for download and
580k are already visible in codex.flywire.ai under the Classification heading for each cell.
32,422 (28%) neurons are intrinsic to the central brain and 73,656 (56%) neurons are
intrinsic to the optic lobes. The optic lobes and the central brain are connected via 7,851
visual projection and 494 visual centrifugal neurons. The central brain receives afferent input
via 5,495 sensory and 2,364 ascending neurons. Efferent output is realised via 1,303
descending, 80 endocrine and 100 motor neurons.
We find striking stereotypy in the number of central brain intrinsic neurons: e.g.
between the left and the right hemisphere they differ by only 35 (0.1%) neurons. For
superclasses with less consistency in left vs right counts such as the ascending neurons
(166, 7%) the discrepancies are typically due to ambiguity in the sidedness (Figure 1D, see
Methods for details).
Combining the dense superclass annotation for all neurons with the connectome1,
gives a birds-eye view of the input/output connectivity of the central brain (Figure 1F): 56%
percent of the central brain’s synaptic input comes from the optic system; 25% from the
ventral nerve cord (VNC) via ascending neurons; and only 19% from peripheral sensory
neurons. This is somewhat surprising since sensory neurons are almost as numerous as
visual projection neurons (Figure 1D,E); individual visual projection neurons therefore
provide about 2.5 times more synapses underscoring the value of this information stream.
Input neurons make about two synapses onto central brain neurons for every one synapse
onto output neurons. Most output targets the VNC via descending neurons (77%); the rest

A full atlas of neuronal lineages in the central brain
Our top-level annotations (flow, superclass, class) provide a systematic but relatively coarse
grouping of neurons compared to the order 5000 terminal cell types from previous work3. We
therefore developed an intermediate level of annotation based on hemilineages – this
provides a powerful bridge between neurons placed within circuits in the connectome and
the developmental origin and molecular specification of neurons (Figure 2A).
Central brain neurons and a minority of visual projection neurons are generated by
~120 identified neuroblasts per hemisphere. Each of these stem cells is defined by a unique
transcriptional code and generates a stereotyped lineage in a precise birth order by

asymmetric
division
(Figure
2B)39–42.
Each
neuroblast
typically
produces
two
hemilineages43,44 that differ markedly in neuronal morphology and can express different
neurotransmitters from one another, but neurons in each hemilineage usually expresses a
single fast-acting transmitter38,45. Hemilineages therefore represent a natural functional as
well as developmental unit by which to study the nervous system. Within a hemilineage
neurons form processes that extend together in one cohesive bundle (the hemilineage tract)
which enters, traverses, and interconnects neuropil compartments in a stereotypical pattern
(Figure 2C). Comparing these features between EM and prior light-level data46–49 allowed us
to compile the first definitive atlas of all hemilineages in the central brain (Figure 2C-E; see
Methods for details).
In total, we identified 120 neuroblast lineages comprising 183 hemilineages for
30,078 (86.4%) central brain neurons (Figure 2F; Figure S2.1). The majority of the
unassigned neurons are likely primary neurons born during embryonic development, which
account for 10% of neurons in the adult brain50,51. We tentatively designated 3,614 (10.4%)
as primary neurons either based on specific identification in the literature42 or expert
assessment of diagnostic morphological features such as broader projections and larger cell
bodies. A further 1,111 (3.2%) neurons did not co-fasciculate with any hemilineage tracts
even though their morphology suggested that they are later-born, secondary neurons52. This
developmental atlas is comprehensive since all but one (SLPpm448) of the 120 previously
described lineages were identified in addition to one new lineage (LHp3/CP5). We were able
to find the expected hemilineages in all but two cases (LHa1_posterior and SLPal4_anterior;
Figure 2G). The number of neurons per hemilineage can vary widely (Figure 2H): for
example, FLAa1 contains just 30 neurons while MBp4 has 1,335 (both hemispheres
combined). In general, however, the number of neurons per hemilineage is between 30 and
123 (10/90 percentile, respectively). Nevertheless, the numbers of neurons within each
hemilineage was highly reliable differing only by 3% (+/-4) between left and right
hemispheres (Figure 2G, right). This is consistent with the near-equality of neurons per
hemisphere noted in Figure 1, and indicates great precision in the developmental programs
controlling neuron number.
Although hemilineages typically contain functionally and morphologically related
neurons, morphology subgroups can be observed53. We further divided each hemilineage
into “morphology groups” which innervate similar brain regions and take similar internal
tracts by NBLAST54 morphological clustering, naming them based on their relative similarity
(Figure 2I, Figure S2.1, Supplemental Files 2 and 3; Supplemental Video 3). This generated
a total of 700 groupings which provide an intermediate layer of annotations above the cell
type level.

The fly brain is mostly left-right symmetric but inspection of the FlyWire dataset
reveals some large asymmetries. For example the visual projection neurons of the VPNd3
lineage48 (including cell types LC6 and LC9) form a large axon bundle. This bundle follows
the normal path in the right hemisphere55 but in the left hemisphere it loops over (i.e. medial)
the mushroom body peduncle; nevertheless, the axons still find their correct targets (Figure
2J). Besides such unexpected asymmetries, the fly brain contains one structure, the
asymmetric body (AB), that is reproducibly ~4 times larger on the right hemisphere of the
fly’s brain than on the left56–58. Surprisingly, we found that the left/right volume of the AB
appeared inverted in FlyWire (Figure 2K). The cause of this is not biological but an
accidental flip during acquisition of the original FAFB EM image data which underlies FlyWire
(Figure S2.2A; see Methods for details). Note that our “side” annotation and all references to
left or right in this paper refer to the correct side of the fly’s brain.

Finding consensus cell types across brains
Next, we sought to compare FlyWire against the hemibrain connectome3; this contains most

cell-typed first by two automated procedures followed by extensive manual review3,59–61:
NBLAST morphology clustering initially yielded 5235 morphology types; multiple rounds of
CBLAST connectivity clustering split 257 of these morphology types into 639 connectivity
types for a final total of 5620 types.
To enable this comparison, we first used non-rigid 3D registration to map 3D meshes
and
skeletons
for
all
hemibrain
neurons
into
FlyWire
space,
enabling
direct
3D
co-visualisation of both datasets and a range of automated analyses (Figure 3A-B). We then
used NBLAST62 to calculate morphological similarity scores between all hemibrain neurons
and the ~62.4k FlyWire neurons with extensive arbours within the hemibrain volume (Figure
S3A-C). Candidate matches were manually reviewed by co-visualisation and only those with
high confidence were accepted (Figure 3C-D).
The majority of hemibrain cell types (57%; 3,237 of 5,620 types, see Methods) were
found in the FlyWire dataset. Crucially, the initial morphological matching process generated
a large corpus of shared labels between datasets; with these in place we developed an
approach to across-dataset connectivity clustering which allowed us to investigate and
resolve difficult cases (see Methods – hemibrain typing with connectivity). For 4% of
cross-matched types, hemibrain type labels were combined to make new, “composite” types
(e.g. “SIP078,SIP080”) because the hemibrain split could not be recapitulated when
examining neurons from both FlyWire and the hemibrain (Figure 3E; Figure S3D,E). This
issue, often exacerbated by the truncation of neurons in the hemibrain dataset, was the main
reason the remaining 2,382 (42%) hemibrain cell types could not be exactly matched (we
address this in detail in Figure 6 below).
In total, we assigned 3,166 high-confidence consensus cell type labels for 42,687
neurons from three different hemispheres and two different brains (e.g. Figure 3B).
Collectively these cross-matched neurons cover 38.1% of central brain edges (comprising
40.7% of synapses) in the FlyWire graph. This body of high-confidence cross-identified
neurons enables both within- (FlyWire left versus right hemisphere) and across-brain
(FlyWire vs hemibrain) comparisons.
Cell types are highly stereotyped within and across brains
Using the consensus cell type labels, we find that the numbers of cells per type across the
three hemispheres are closely correlated (Figure 3G). About 1 in 6 cell types shows a
difference in numbers between the left and right hemisphere and 1 in 4 across brains
(FlyWire versus hemibrain). The mean difference in number of cells per type is small though:
0.3 (+/-1.7) within- and 0.7 (+/-10) across brains. Importantly, cell types with fewer neurons
per type are less variable (Figure S3H). At the extreme, “singleton” cell types account for
65% of all types in our sample; they often appear to be embryonic-born, or early secondary

neurons, and only very rarely comprise more than one neuron: only 2% of neurons that are
singletons in both FlyWire hemispheres have more than 1 member in the hemibrain. In
contrast, more numerous cell types are also more likely to vary in number both within but
even more so across brains (Figure S3H,I).
Synapse counts were also largely consistent within cell types, both within and across
brains (Figure 3H). To enable a fair comparison, the FlyWire synapse cloud was restricted to
the smaller hemibrain volume. Although this does not correct for other potential confounds
such as differences in the synaptic completion rates or synapse detection, pre- and
postsynapse counts per cell type were highly correlated, both within- (Pearson R 0.99,
p<0.001) and across-brains (Pearson R 0.95/0.8 for pre- and postsynapses, respectively,
p<0.001; Figure 3H; Figure S3J,K). This is an important quality control and pre-requisite for
subsequent connectivity comparisons.

Interpreting connectomes
Brain wiring develops through a complex and probabilistic developmental process63,64. To
interpret the connectome it is vital to obtain a basic understanding of how variable that
biological process is. This is complicated by the fact that the connectome we observe is
shaped not just by biological variability but also by technical noise, e.g. from segmentation
issues, synapse detection errors and synaptic completion rates (the fraction of synapses
attached to proofread neurons) (Figure 4A). Here, we use the consensus cell types to
assess which connections are reliably observed across three hemispheres of connectome
data. We use the term “edge” to describe the set of connections between two cell types, and
its “weight” as the number of unitary synapses forming that connection.
Weights of individual edges are highly correlated within (Pearson R 0.96, p<0.001)
and across (Pearson R 0.81, p<0.001) brains (Figure 4B, Figure S4A). Consistent with this,
cell types exhibit highly similar connectivity within as well as across brains (Figure 4C, Figure
S4B-C). While the connectivity (cosine) similarity across brains is lower than within brains
(p<0.001), the effect size is small (0.033 +/- 0.119) and is at least in part due to the
aforementioned truncation in the hemibrain.
Given an edge between two cell types in one hemisphere, what are the odds of
finding the same connection in another hemisphere or brain? Examination of 434,790 edges
present in at least one of the three brain hemispheres showed that about half the edges
observed in the hemibrain were also found in FlyWire. This fraction is slightly higher when
comparing between the two FlyWire hemispheres: left→right: 57%; right→left: 59% (Figure
4D). Weaker edges were less likely to be consistent: an edge consisting of a single synapse
in the hemibrain has a 41% chance to be also present in a single FlyWire hemisphere, and
only a 14% chance to be seen in both hemispheres of FlyWire (Figure 4E). In contrast,
edges of >10 synapses can be reproducibly found (>90%). Although only 16% of all edges
meet this threshold, they comprise ~79% of all synapses (Figure 4F; Figure S4E). We also
analysed normalised edge weights expressed as a fraction of the input onto each
downstream neuron; this accounts for the small difference in synaptic completion rate
between FlyWire and the hemibrain. With this treatment, the distributions are almost
identical for within and across brain comparisons (Figure 4F, compare left and right panels);
edges constituting >1.1% of the target cell type’s total inputs have a greater than 90%
chance of persisting (Figure 4F, right panel). Around 7% of edges, collectively containing
over half (54%) of all synapses, meet this threshold.
We observed that the fraction of edges persisting across datasets plateaued as the
edge weight increased. Using a level of 99% edge persistence, we can define a second
principled heuristic: edges greater than 40 synapses or 3% edge weight can be considered

strong. It is important to note that these statistics defined across the whole connectome can
have exceptions in individual neurons. For example, descending neuron DNp42 receives 34
synapses from PLP146 in FlyWire right, but none on the left or hemibrain; this may well be
an example of developmental noise (i.e., bona fide biological variability, rather than technical
noise).
So far we have only asked a binary question: does an edge exist or not? However,
the conservation of edge weight is also highly relevant for interpreting connectomes. Given
that an edge is present in two or more hemispheres, what are the odds that it will have a
similar weight? Although edge weights within and across brains are highly correlated (Figure
4B), a 30-synapse edge in the hemibrain, for example, will on average consist of 26
synapses in FlyWire, likely because of differences in synaptic detection and completion rates
for these two datasets imaged with different EM modalities1. The variance of edge weights is
considerable: 25% of all 30-synapse hemibrain edges will consist of fewer than 10 synapses
in FlyWire, and 5% will consist of only 1-3 synapses. Consistency is greater when looking
within FlyWire: a 30-synapse edge on the left will, on average, also consist of 30 synapses
on the right. Still, 25% of all 30-synapse edges on the left will consist of 15 synapses or less
on the right, and 5% of only 1-7 synapses (Figure 4G).
How much of this edge weight variability is biological and how much is technical? To
assess this, the impact of technical noise on a fictive ground truth model was assessed
(Figure 4H; Methods). This model was randomly subsampled according to postsynaptic
completion rate (in the mushroom body, for example, this ranges from 46% in FlyWire right
to 77% in hemibrain; see Figure S4F), and synapses were randomly added and deleted
according to the false-positive and -negative rates reported for the synapse detection65.
Repeated application of this procedure generated a distribution of edge weights between
each cell type pair expected due to technical noise alone. On average, 65% of the observed
variability of edge weight between hemispheres fell within the range expected due to
technical noise; this fraction approached 100% for weaker synapses (Figure 4I). For
example, cell type LHCENT3 targets LHAV3g2 with 30 synapses on the left but only 23 on
the right of FlyWire, which is within the 5-95% quantiles expected due to technical noise
alone. Overall, this analysis shows that observed variability (Figure 4G, right) is greater than
can be accounted for by technical noise, establishing a lower bound for likely biological
variability (Figure 4J), and suggests another simple heuristic: differences in edge weights of
+/-30% or less may be entirely due to technical noise and should not be over-interpreted.

Variability in the mushroom body
The comprehensive annotation of cell types in the FlyWire dataset revealed that the number
of Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, is 30% larger per hemisphere than in
the hemibrain (2,597 KCs in FlyWire right; 2,580 in FlyWire left; and 1,917 in hemibrain), well
above the average variation in cell counts (5% +/-12%). While these KC counts are within
the previously reported range66, the difference presents an opportunity to investigate how
connectomes accommodate perturbations in cell count. The mushroom body contains 5
principal cell classes: KCs, mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), modulatory neurons
(DANs, OANs), the DPM and APL giant interneurons67 (Figure 5A). KCs further divide into 5
main cell types based on which parts of the mushroom body they innervate: KCab, KCab-p,
KCg-m, KCa’b’ and KCg-d (Figure 5B). Of those, KCab, KCa’b’ and KCg-m are the primary
recipients of largely random59,68 (but see 69) olfactory input via ~130 antennal lobe projection

neurons (ALPNs) comprising 58 canonical types59,60. Global activity in the mushroom body is
regulated via an inhibitory feedback loop mediated by APL, a single large GABAergic
neuron70. Analogous to the mammalian cerebellum, KCs transform the dense overlapping
odour responses of the early olfactory system into sparse non-overlapping representations
which enable the animal to discriminate individual odours during associative learning71,72.
The difference in cell counts is not evenly distributed across all KC types: KCg-m (and to a
lesser extent KCg-d and KCa’b’) are almost twice as numerous in FlyWire versus hemibrain
while KCab and KCab-p are present in similar numbers (Figure 5C). Protein starvation
during the larval stage can induce specific increases in KCg-m number73, suggesting that
environmental variations in food resources may have contributed to this difference.
How does this affect the mushroom body circuitry? We opted to compare the fraction
of the input or output synaptic budget across different KCs since this is well matched to our
question and naturally handles a range of technical noise issues that seemed particularly
prominent in the mushroom body completion rate (see Methods; Figure S5A). We found that
despite the large difference in KCg-m cell counts between FlyWire and hemibrain, this cell
type consistently makes and receives 32% and 45% of all KC pre- and postsynapses,
respectively (Figure 5D and S5E). This suggested that individual FlyWire KCg-m neurons
receive fewer inputs and make fewer outputs than their hemibrain counterparts. The share of
ALPN outputs allocated to KCg-m is ~55% across all hemispheres (Figure 5E), and the
average ALPN→KCg-m connection is comparable in strength across hemispheres (Figure
S5F); however, each KCg-m receives input from a much smaller number of ALPN types in
FlyWire than in the hemibrain (5.74, 5.88 and 8.76 for FlyWire left, right and hemibrain,
respectively; Figure 5F). FlyWire KCg-m therefore receive inputs with the same strength but
from fewer ALPNs.
This pattern holds for other KCg-m synaptic partners as well. Similar to the excitatory
ALPNs, the share of APL outputs allocated to KCg-m is essentially constant across
hemispheres (Figure 5G). Therefore each individual KCg-m receives proportionally less
inhibition from the APL, as well as less excitation, maintaining a similar excitation-inhibition
ratio (Figure 5H). Further, as a population, KCg-m contributes similar amounts of input to
MBONs (Figure 5I,J and S3H).
Past theoretical work has shown that the number ( ) of discrete odour channels (i.e.,
𝐾
ALPN types) providing input to each KC has an optimal value for maximising dimensionality
of KC activity, and therefore, discriminability of olfactory input71,72. The smaller value for 𝐾
observed for KCg-m in the FlyWire connectome (Figure 5G) raises the question of how
dimensionality varies with
for each of the KC types. Using the neural network rate model of
𝐾

APL. This analysis revealed that optimal values for
are lower for KCg-m in FlyWire than
𝐾
the hemibrain (Figure 5K), similar to the observed values.
Taken together these results demonstrate that for KCg-m the brain compensates for
a developmental perturbation by changing a single parameter: the number of odour channels
each KC samples from. In contrast, KCa’b’s, which are also more numerous in FlyWire than
in the hemibrain, appear to employ a hybrid strategy of reduced
combined with a reduction
𝐾
in ALPN→KCa’b’ connection strength (Figure S5F). These findings contradict earlier studies
where a global increase in KC numbers through genetic manipulation triggered an increase
in ALPN axon boutons (indicating an compensatory increase in excitatory drive to KCs) and
a modest increase in KC claws (suggesting an increase rather than decrease in
)74,75. This
𝐾
may be due to the differences in the nature and timing of the perturbation in KC cell number,
and KC types affected.

Toward multi-connectome cell typing
As the first dense, large-scale connectome of a fly brain, the hemibrain dataset proposed
over 4000 previously unknown new cell types. The majority of these new types were
generated by NBLAST morphology clustering followed by multiple rounds of CBLAST
connectivity clustering and extensive manual review3,59–61. Because the hemibrain volume
does not span the entire brain, most new types were, by necessity, based on data from a
single hemisphere. This raises the question of how reproducible the hemibrain cell types are
and, more generally, of how to incorporate multiple connectomes into the definition of cell
type.
During the mapping of hemibrain cell types to the FlyWire dataset (Figure 3),
mapping failures fell into three cases:
1.
Two or more hemibrain types were inappropriately split and had to be merged (Figure
3E).
2.
A hemibrain type was under-split and had to be split further (Figure 3F).
3.
Subsets of neurons within two or more hemibrain cell types co-clustered with different
groups of FlyWire neurons, suggesting type misassignment.
Cases 1 and 2 are relatively easy to resolve and were to some extent anticipated during the
hemibrain typing efforts. Case 3, however, suggests that some hemibrain cell types are not
replicable across brains and the neurons in question require retyping. This category also
included particularly difficult cases suggestive of continuous variation (see Methods –
Hemibrain cell type matching). It is likely that most of the ~2.5k hemibrain types which
remain unmatched to FlyWire neurons by standard methods fall into this third category.
To address these complex typing issues we employ a new definition of cell type that
uses inter-animal variability to determine when cell types should be split: A cell type is a
group of neurons that is more similar to a group of neurons in another brain than to any other
neuron in the same brain. This definition is flexible with respect to the exact similarity metric,

but in the context of connectomics, a similarity measure incorporating morphology and
connectivity is most useful. The algorithmic implementation of this definition operates on the
co-clustering dendrogram by finding the smallest possible clusters that satisfy two criteria
(Figure 6A):
1.
Each cluster must contain neurons from all three hemispheres (hemibrain, FlyWire
right and FlyWire left).
2.
Within each cluster, the number of neurons from each hemisphere must be
approximately equal.
Analysis of the hemibrain cell type AOTU063 provides a relatively straightforward example of
the approach (Figure 6B; Figure S7). Morphology-based clustering generates a single group,
comprising all four AOTU063 neurons from each of the three hemispheres. However,
clustering of these neurons based on connectivity reveals two discrete groups, with roughly
equal numbers of neurons, suggesting that this type should be split further (Case 2, above).
Here, algorithmic analysis across multiple connectomes reveals consistent connectivity
differences between subsets of AOTU063 neurons.
Is this approach applicable to more challenging sets of neurons? We tested it on two
groups of neurons in the central complex (CX) (Figure 6C), a centre for navigation in the
insect brain that has been subject to detailed connectome analysis61. Both groups innervate
the so-called fan-shaped body (FB) but are fundamentally different in organisation. The first
group, FC1-3 (357 neurons in total) consists of columnar cell types that tile the FB, while the
second group, FB1-9 (897 neurons in total) contains tangential cell types whose neurons
occupy the same space61 (Figure 6D). Standard NBLAST similarity assumes that neurons of
the same cell type overlap closely in space; while this is true for most central brain types it
does not hold for repeated columnar neurons such as those in the optic lobe or here in the
fan-shaped body. We therefore used a connectivity-only distance metric co-clustering across
the three hemispheres. This resulted in 7 clusters satisfying the above criteria (Figure 6E,F).
Five of these “cross-brain” types have a one-to-one correspondence with hemibrain types,
while two are merges of multiple hemibrain types; only a small number of neurons are
recombined
across
types
(Figure 6G). For the second group, FB1-9, a combined
morphology
and
connectivity
embedding
was
suitable.
Co-clustering generated 114
cross-brain cell types compared to 146 cell types in the hemibrain (Figure 6H-J). In contrast
to the FC1-3 group, only about 44% of cross-brain types correspond one-to-one to a
hemibrain cell type; 11% are splits (1:many), 12% are merges (many:1), and 33% are
recombinations (many:many) of hemibrain cell types (Figure 6K; Figure S6B).
Although our initial efforts focussed strongly on identification of hemibrain-defined cell
types in the FlyWire connectome, this analysis of a subset of challenging neurons

demonstrates a viable approach for joint analysis of multiple connectomes which should lead
to substantially more robust cell types.
Discussion
In this study, we generate human-readable annotations for all neurons in the fly brain at
various levels of granularity (superclass, cell class, hemilineage, etc). These annotations
provide salient groupings which have already been proven useful not just in our own
analyses, but also many of those in our companion paper1 as well as other publications in
the FlyWire paper package introduced there, and to all researchers now using the online
platforms
Codex
(codex.flywire.ai)
and
FAFB-FlyWire
CATMAID
spaces
(fafb-flywire.catmaid.org). Hemilineage annotations also provide a key starting point to link
the molecular basis of development of the central brain to the wiring revealed by the
connectome; such work has already begun in the simpler and more repetitive wiring of the
optic lobe76.
The cell type atlas that we provide of 4,179 cell types is not the largest ever proposed
(the hemibrain had 5,620, and very new work in the mouse brain has offered up to 5,000
molecular clusters77–79). However it is, by some margin, the largest ever validated collection
of cell types. A cell type is a falsifiable hypothesis about biological variability within and
across animals34. In C. elegans, the 118 cell types inferred from the original connectome
have been clearly supported by analysis of subsequent connectomes and molecular
data4,5,80–82. In a few cases in mammals, it has been possible to produce catalogues of order
100 cell types that have been validated by multimodal data e.g. in the retina or motor
cortex35,83,84. However, large scale molecular atlases produce highly informative hierarchies
but do not yet try to define terminal cell types – the finest unit that is robust across
individuals – with precision. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we test this falsifiable
cell type hypothesis for over 5,000 cell types, confirming or correcting about 3,166 cell types
across 3 hemispheres of connectome data. It is important to note that connectome data is
particularly powerful for cell typing: it is inherently multimodal (by providing morphology and
connectivity) and the ability to see all cells within a brain (completeness) is uniquely
powerful. Cell types that have passed this rigorous test are very unlikely to be revised
(permanence). Informed by this understanding, the additional 850 cell types defined solely
within the two hemispheres of the FlyWire dataset should also be accurate and permanent.
We suspect that connectome data will become the gold standard for cell typing. Linking
molecular and connectomics cell types will therefore be key.

It is natural to feel some surprise, perhaps even disappointment, that over a third of
hemibrain cell types could not yet be identified in FlyWire. It is important to temper this by
reiterating that the majority can be identified and we expect continued incremental
improvements through our own efforts and those of other research colleagues building on
the platform and tools now in place. Nevertheless, we believe our results reveal several
important issues. First, many cell types identified using a single brain hemisphere of data will
now need to be revised. Second, our new multi-connectome typing approach (Figure 6)
provides a robust and efficient way to do this. Of course multiple connectomes will not
become routinely available for some time. Nevertheless, our approach should allow other
methods to be calibrated. There is an interesting analogy in the assignment of species,
another difficult problem in biological classification, reproductive isolation can only rarely be
tested, but it serves as a thought experiment to calibrate a molecular clock33. With this in
mind it will be interesting to test in future the benefits of using two hemispheres of one brain
vs multiple different brains; our results in Figure 4 suggest that within-brain variability is of
similar magnitude but still measurably smaller than across-brain variability. Third, the adult fly
contains challenging examples of continuous variation more typically associated with
mammalian cell types33. However we also now have tools and data that allow us to address
such variation with a precision that has been impossible until now.
In the introduction we set out to answer three questions, which we will now discuss in
closing.
Can we simplify the connectome graph to aid automated or human analysis?
Cell typing reduces the complexity of the connectome graph. This has important implications
for analysis, modelling, experimental work and developmental biology. For the cell types
already assigned, we can map 40,950 nodes in the raw connectome graph onto 4,179 nodes
in the reduced cell type graph; the number of edges is similarly reduced. This should
significantly aid human reasoning about the connectome. It will also make numerous
network analyses possible as well as substantially reduce the degrees of freedom in brain
scale modelling85,86. It is important to note that while collapsing multiple cells for a given cell
type into a single node is often desirable, other use cases such as modelling studies may
still need to retain each individual cell. However, if key parameters are determined on a per
cell type basis, then the complexity of the resultant model can be much reduced. Recently
Lappalainen et al.85 optimised and analysed a highly successful 1000 parameter model of
large parts of the fly visual system based on connectomic cell types.
For Drosophila experimentalists using the connectome, cell typing identifies groups
of cells that likely form functional units. Most of these are linked though virtualflybrain.org to

the published literature and in many cases to molecular reagents. Others will be more easily
identified for targeted labelling and manipulation after typing. Finally, cell typing effectively
compresses the connectome, reducing the bits required to store and specify the graph. For a
fly-sized connectome this is no longer that important for computerised analysis, but it may be
important for development. Zador87 has argued that evolution has selected highly structured
brain connectivity enabling animals to learn very rapidly, but that these wiring diagrams are
far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome; rather they must be compressed
through a “genomic bottleneck” which may itself have be a crucial part of evolving robust and
efficient nervous systems. If we accept this argument, lossy compression based on
aggregating nodes with similar cell type labels, approximately specifying strong edges and
largely ignoring weak edges would reduce the storage requirements by orders of magnitude
and could be a specific implementation of this bottleneck.
How do we know which edges are important?
The question of which of the 16.5M edges in the connectome to pay attention to is critical for
its interpretation. Intuitively we assume that the more synapses are found to connect two
neurons, the more important that connection must be. There is some very limited evidence in
support of this assumption correlating anatomical and functional connectivity88,89 (compare in
mammals90). In lieu of physiological data, we postulate that edges critical to brain function
should be consistently found across brains. By comparing connections between cell types
identified in 3 hemispheres we find that edges stronger than 10 synapses or 1.1% of the
target’s inputs have a greater than 90% chance to be preserved (Figure 4F). This provides a
simple heuristic for determining which edges are likely to be functionally relevant. It is also
remarkably consistent with new findings from the larval connectome where left-right
asymmetries in connectivity vanish after removing edges weaker than <1.25%91. It is
important to note though that edges falling below the threshold might still significantly
contribute to the brain’s function.
We further address an issue that has received little attention (but see92): the impact of
technical factors (such as segmentation, proofreading, synapse detection) and biological
variability on the final connectome and how to compensate for it. In our hands, a model of
technical noise could explain up to 30% difference in edge weights. While this model was
made specifically for the two hemispheres of FlyWire, it highlights the general point that a
firm understanding of all sources of variability will be vital for the young field of comparative
connectomics to distinguish real and artificial differences.

Have we collected a snowflake?
The field of connectomics has long been criticised for unavoidably low N93,94: is the brain of a
single specimen representative for all? For insects, there is a large body of evidence for
morphological and functional stereotypy, although this information is only available for a
minority of neurons and much less is known about stereotyped connectivity34,95,96. For
vertebrate brains the situation is less clear again; it is generally assumed that subcortical
regions will be more stereotyped, but cortex also has conserved canonical microcircuits97
and recent evidence has shown that some cortical elements can be genetically and
functionally stereotyped98–100. Given how critical stereotypy is for connectomics it is important
to check whether that premise actually still holds true at synaptic resolution.
For the fly connectome, the answer to our question is actually both more nuanced and more
interesting than we initially imagined. Based on conservation of edges between FlyWire and
hemibrain hemispheres over 50% of the connectome graph is a snowflake! Of course these
non-reproducible edges are mostly weak. Our criterion for strong (highly reliable) edges
retains between 7-16% of edges and 50-70% of synapses.
We previously showed that the early olfactory system of the fly is highly stereotyped
in both neuronal number and connectvity60. That study used the same EM datasets - FAFB
and the hemibrain - but was limited in scope since only manual reconstruction in FAFB was
then available. We now analyse brain-wide data from two brains (FlyWire and the hemibrain)
and three hemispheres to address this question and find a high degree of stereotypy at
every level: neuron counts are highly consistent between brains, as are connections above a
certain weight. However, when examining so many neurons in a brain, we can see that cell
counts are very different for some neurons; furthermore neurons occasionally do something
unexpected (take a different route or make an extra branch on one side of the brain). In fact,
we hypothesise that such stochastic differences are unnoticed variability present in most
brains; this is reminiscent of the observation that most humans carry multiple significant
genetic mutations. We did observe one example of a substantial biological difference that
was consistent across hemispheres but not brains: the number of the KCg-m neurons in the
mushroom bodies is almost twice as numerous in FlyWire than in the hemibrain. Intriguingly,
we found evidence that the brain compensates for this perturbation by modifying connectivity
(Figure 5).
In conclusion, we can say that we have not collected a snowflake; the core FlyWire
connectome is highly conserved and the accompanying annotations will be broadly useful
across all studies of Drosophila melanogaster. However, our analyses show the importance
of calibrating our understanding of biological (and technical) variability – as has recently
been done across animals in C. elegans82 and within hemispheres in larval Drosophila91,101 –

1.176 (presynapses, i.e. outputs) 0.983 (post) between FlyWire and the hemibrain. Note that
correlation and slope are noticeably worse for cell types known to be truncated such as visual
projection neurons which suggests that we did not fully compensate for the hemibrain’s truncation
and that the actual across-brain correlation might be even better.

Annotations
Base annotations
At the time of writing, the general FlyWire annotation system operates in a read-only mode in
which users can add additional annotations for a neuron but cannot edit or delete existing
annotations. Furthermore, the annotations consist of a single free-form text field bound to a
spatial location. This enabled many flywire users (including our own group) to contribute a
wide range of community annotations, which are reported in our companion paper1 but are
not considered in this study. As it became apparent that a complete connectome could be
obtained, we found that this approach was not a good fit for our goal of obtaining a
structured, systematic and canonical set of annotations for each neuron with extensive
manual curation. We therefore set up a web database (seatable, see https://seatable.io/) that
allowed records for each neuron to be edited and corrected over time; columns with specific
acceptable values were added as necessary.
Each neuron was defined by a single point location (aka root point) and its associated
PyChunkedGraph supervoxel. Root IDs were updated every 30min by a Python script based
on the fafbseg package (see Table 1) to account for any edits. The canonical point for the

neuron was either a location on a large calibre neurite within the main arbour of the neuron,
a location on the cell body fibre close to where it entered the neuropil, or a position within the
nucleus as defined by the nucleus segmentation table105. The former was preferred since
segmentation errors in the cell body fibre tracts regularly resulted in the wrong soma being
attached to a given neuronal arbour. These soma swap errors persisted late into
proofreading and when fixed resulted in annotation information being attached to the wrong
neuron until this in turn was fixed.
We also note that our annotations include a number of non-neuronal cells/objects such as
glia cells, trachea, ECM which others might find useful (superclass not_a_neuron).
Soma Position and Side
Besides the canonical root point, the soma position was recorded for all neurons with a cell
body. This was either based on curating entries in the nucleus segmentation table (removing
duplicates or positions outside the nucleus) or on selecting a location, especially when the
cell body fibre was truncated and no soma could be identified in the dataset. These soma
locations were critical for a number of analyses and also allowed a consistent side to be
defined for each neuron. This was initialised by mapping all soma positions to the symmetric
JRC2018F template and then using a cutting plane at the midline perpendicular to the
mediolateral (X) axis to define left and right. However all soma positions within 20 µm of the
midline plane were then manually reviewed. The goal was to define a consistent logical
soma side based on examination of the cell body fibre tracts entering the brain; this
ultimately ensured that cell types present e.g. in one copy per brain hemisphere were always
annotated so that one neuron was identified as the left and the other the right. In a small
number of cases - e.g. for the bilaterally symmetric octopaminergic VUM (ventral unpaired
medial) neurons - we assigned side “central”.
For sensory neurons, side refers to whether they enter the brain through the left or the right
nerve. In a small number of cases we could not unambiguously identify the nerve entry side
and assigned side “na”.
Hierarchical annotations
Hierarchical annotations include flow, superclass, class (+ a subclass in certain cases) and
cell
type.
The
flow
and
superclass
was
generally
assigned
based
on
an
initial
semi-automated approach followed by extensive and iterative manual curation. See
Supplemental Table S2 for definitions and sections below for details on certain superclasses.
Based on the superclasses we define two useful groupings which are used throughout the
main text:
-
Central brain neurons consist of all neurons with their somata in the central brain
defined by the five superclasses: central, descending, visual centrifugal, motor,
endocrine.
-
Central brain associated neurons further include superclasses: visual projection
neurons, ascending neurons and sensory neurons (but omit sensory neurons with
cell class: visual).

Cell classes represent salient groupings/terms that have been previously used in the
literature (see Supplemental Table S2 for examples). For sensory neurons, the class
indicates their modality (where known).
Sensory and motor neuron identification
We identified all non-visual sensory and motor neurons entering/exiting the brain through the
antennal, eye, occipital, and labial nerves by screening all axon profiles in a given nerve.
Sensory neurons were further cross-referenced to existing literature to assign modalities (via
the class field) and, where applicable, a cell type. Previous studies have identified almost all
head mechanosensory bristle and taste peg mechanosensory neurons (BMN and TPMN; 106)
in the left hemisphere (at time of publication: right hemisphere). Gustatory sensory neurons
(GRN) were previously identified by 107 and Johnston’s Organ neurons (JON) by 108,109 and 109
in
a
version
of
FAFB
that
employed
manual
reconstruction
(https://fafb.catmaid.virtualflybrain.org).
Those
neurons
were
identified
in the FlyWire
instance by transformation and overlay onto FlyWire space as described by 106.
JONs in the right hemisphere were characterised based on innervation of the major AMMC
zones (A, B, C, D, E and F), but not further classified into subzone innervation as shown
in108. Other sensory neurons (BMNs, TPMNs and GRNs) in the right hemisphere were
identified through NBLAST-based matching of their mirrored morphology to the left
hemisphere and expert review. Olfactory, thermo- and hygrosensory of the antennal lobes
were identified via their connectivity to cognate uniglomerular projection neurons and
NBLAST-based matching to previously identified hemibrain neurons60,110.
Visual sensory neurons (R1-6, R7-8 and ocellar photoreceptor neurons) were identified by
manually screening neurons with presynapse in either the lamina, the medulla and/or the
ocellar ganglia111. Out of the expected 12,800 photoreceptor neurons from the retina we have
found only 3,943 so far due but more will be identified in the future. For the ocelli, all 270
photoreceptor neurons were annotated.
Ascending and descending neuron identification
We seeded all profiles in a cross section in the ventral posterior gnathal ganglion (GNG)
through the cervical connective to identify all neurons entering and exiting the brain at the
neck. We identified all descending neurons (DNs) based on the following criteria:
1.
Soma located within the brain dataset
2.
Main axon branch leaving the brain through the cervical connective
We then classified the DNs based on their soma location according to 112. Briefly, the soma of
DNa, DNb, DNc and DNd is located in the anterior half (a - anterior dorsal, b - anterior
ventral, c - in the pars intercerebralis, d - outside cell cluster on the surface) and DNp in the
posterior half of the central brain. DNg somas are located in the GNG.
To identify DNs described by 112 in the EM dataset we transformed the volume renderings of
DN GAL4 lines into FAFB space. Displaying EM and LM neurons in the same space enabled
accurate matching of closely morphologically related neurons. For DNs without available
volume renderings we identified candidate EM matches by eye, transformed them into
JRC2018U space and overlaid them onto the GAL4 or Split GAL4 line stacks (named in 112
for that type) in FIJI for verification. With these methods we identified all but 2 (DNd01 and
DNg25) in FAFB and annotated their cell type with the published nomenclature. All other

unmatched DNs received a systematic cell type consisting of their soma location, an “e” for
EM type and a three digit number (e.g. DNae001). A detailed account and analysis of
descending neurons will be published separately (Eichler et al., in prep).
Hemilineage annotations
Central nervous system lineages were initially mapped for the 3rd instar larval brain, where,
for each lineage, the neuroblast of origin and its progeny are directly visible113–116. Genetic
tools that allow stochastic clonal analysis117 have enabled researchers to visualise individual
lineages as GFP-marked “clones”. Clones reveal the stereotyped morphological footprint of
a lineage, its overall “projection envelope”47, as well as the cohesive fibre bundles - so-called
“hemilineage-associated tracts” (HATs) - formed by neurons belonging to it. Using these
characteristics, lineages could be also identified in the embryo and early larva118,119, as well
as in pupae and adults46–49,53,120. HATs can also be readily identified in the EM image data,
and we used them, in conjunction with clonal projection envelopes, to identify hemilineages
in the EM dataset through a combination of the following methods:
1.
Visual comparison of HATs formed by reconstructed neurons in the EM, and the light
microscopic map reconstructed from anti-Neuroglian-labelled brains46,48,49: In cross
section, tracts typically appear as clusters of 50-100 tightly packed, rounded contours
of uniform diameter (~200 nm), surrounded by neuronal cell bodies (when sectioned
in the cortex) or irregularly shaped terminal neurite branches and synapses (when
sectioned in the neuropil area; Figure 2C). The point of entry and trajectory of a HAT
in the neuropil is characteristic for a hemilineage.
2.
Matching branching pattern of reconstructed neurons with the projection envelope of
clones:
as
expected
from
the
light
microscopic
map
based
on
anti-Neuroglian-labelled brains46, the majority of hemilineage tracts visible in the EM
dataset occur in pairs or small groups (3-5). Within these groups, individual tracts are
often lined by fibres of larger (and more variable) diameter, as shown in Figure 2C.
However, the boundary between closely adjacent hemilineage tracts is often difficult
to draw based on the EM image alone. In these cases, visual inspection and
quantitative comparison of the reconstructed neurons belonging to a hemilineage
tract with the projection envelope of the corresponding clone, which can be projected
into the EM dataset through Pyroglancer (see Table 1), assists in properly assigning
neurons to their hemilineages.
3.
Identifying homologous HATs across three different hemispheres (left and right of
FlyWire,
hemibrain):
by
comparison
of
morphology
(NBLAST62),
as
well
as
connectivity (assuming that homologous neurons share synaptic partners), we were
able to assign the large majority of neurons to specific HATs that matched in all three
hemispheres.
In existing literature two systems for hemilineage nomenclature are used: “Ito/Lee”48,49 and
“Hartenstein”46,47. While they overlap in large parts, some lineages have only been described
in one but not the other nomenclature. In the main text, we provide (hemi-)lineages
according to the “ItoLee” nomenclature for simplicity. Below and in the supplements we also
provide
both
names
as
“ItoLee/Hartenstein”,
and
the
mapping
between
the
two
nomenclatures is provided in Supplementary File 2. From prior literature we expected a total
of around 120 lineages in the central brain, including the gnathal ganglia (GNG)46–49,103.
Indeed, we were able to identify 120 lineages based on light-level clones and tracts, as well
as the HATs in FlyWire. Among these, LHp3/CP5 could not be matched to any clone. We

have not yet identified SLPpm4 which is only present in48. Therefore, together, we expect to
eventually identify 121 lineages.
By comprehensively inspecting the hemilineage tracts originally in CATMAID and
then in FlyWire, we can now reconcile previous reports. Specifically, new to48,49 (‘ItoLee
nomenclature’) are: CREl1/DALv3, LHp3/CP5, DILP/DILP, LALa1/BAlp2, SMPpm1/DPMm2
and VLPl5/BLVa3_or_4 - we gave these neurons lineage names following the naming
scheme in48,49. New to46 (‘Hartenstein nomenclature’) are: SLPal5/BLAd5, SLPav3/BLVa2a,
LHl3/BLVa2b, SLPpl3/BLVa2c, PBp1/CM6, SLPpl2/CP6, SMPpd2/DPLc6, PSp1/DPMl2, and
LHp3/CP5 - we named these units following the Hartenstein nomenclature naming scheme.
We
did
not
take
the
following
clones
from48
into
account
for the total count of
lineages/hemilineages, because they originate in the optic lobe and their neuroblast of origin
has not been clearly demonstrated in the larva: VPNd2, VPNd3, VPNd4, VPNp2, VPNp3,
VPNp4, VPNv1, VPNv2, VPNv3.
For calculating the total number of hemilineages, to keep the inclusion criteria
consistent with the lineages, we included the Type II lineages (DM1-6) by counting the
number of cell body fibre tracts, acknowledging that they may or may not be hemilineages.
Neuroblasts of type II lineages, instead of generating ganglion mother cells that each divide
once, amplify their number, generating multiple intermediate progenitors (IPs) that in turn
continue dividing like neuroblasts43,121,122. It has not been established how the tracts visible in
type II clones (and included in Figure S2.1 and Supplemental Files 2 and 3) relate to the
(large number of) type II hemilineages.
There are also 3 type I lineages (VPNl&d1/​BLAl2, VLPl2/BLAv2 and VLPp&l1/DPLpv)
with more than two tracts in the clone; we included these additional tracts in the
hemilineages provided in the text. Without taking these Type I and Type II tracts into
account, we identified 145 hemilineages.
A minority of neurons in the central brain could not reliably be assigned to a lineage.
These mainly include the (putative) primary neurons (3,614). Primary neurons, born in the
embryo and already differentiated in the larva, form small tracts with which the secondary
neurons become closely associated52. In the adult brain, morphological criteria that
unambiguously differentiate between primary and secondary neurons have not yet been
established.
In
cases
where
experimental
evidence
exists42
primary
neurons
have
significantly larger cell bodies and cell body fibres. Loosely taking these criteria into account
we surmise that a fraction of primary neurons form part of the HATs defined as described
above. However, aside from the HATs, we see multiple small bundles, typically close to but
not contiguous with the HATs, which we assume to consist of primary neurons. Overall,
these small bundles contained 3,614 neurons, designated as “primary” or “putative primary”
neurons.
Morphological groups
We further subdivided hemilineages into groups of neurons defined by shared morphological
characteristics (“morphological groups”). As a first step, neurons were mirrored from one
hemisphere to another, and pairwise morphological similarity scores were generated using
NBLAST62. Neurons were then hierarchically clustered. To determine the coarseness of the
groups (i.e. where to cut the dendrogram exemplified in Figure 2I), we used the ‘elbow
method’123, which uses the point of the most abrupt change in the cluster distance.
Morphological groups were named after the compartments that they innervated. Figure 2I
illustrates the classification of hemilineage AOTUv3_dorsal, for which our method defines
four groups:

1.
The first group (yellow in Fig 2I, AOTUv3_dorsal_1/AOTU_BU_MB_PED in Suppl.
File 1) innervates a small domain in the lateral AOTU and projects to the dorsal and
anterior bulb (BU; yellow); this class corresponds to the previously defined TuBu_s
and TuBu_a neurons124,125.
2.
The second group (green in Fig 2I, AOTUv3_dorsal_4/AOTU_LAL_SMP in Suppl.
File 1) also has branches in medial AOTU and SIP SMP, but projects to the LAL.
3.
The third (red in Fig 2I, AOTUv3_dorsal_3/AOTU_IB_SIP in Suppl. File 1) has
proximal branches in the medial AOTU and (sparsely) the SIP, and projects to the
inferior bridge (IB), as well to the contralateral AOTU and SIP.
4.
The fourth (purple in Fig 2I, AOTUv3_dorsal_2/IB_SIP_SMP in Suppl. File 1) lacks
innervation of the AOTU, and interconnects the adjacent SIP with SMP and IB.
In a similar manner, other hemilineages cluster into discrete non-overlapping groups of
neurons that represent anatomical “modules”, forming connections between specific brain
domains. The morphological groups, and the top three neuropils innervated by each
morphological group, are recorded in Supplementary Files 2 and 3. There are in general 2-5

groups

hemilineage;

FAFB Laterality
Our observations (and those of the Rachel Wilson lab, Pratyush Kandimalla and Stephane
Noselli, see Acknowledgements) of the asymmetric body (AB) in FAFB-FlyWire led us to
catch an error made in assembling the original FAFB14 dataset32. The asymmetric bodies of
the central complex should be larger on the fly’s right56,57 but in the FAFB volume appeared
enlarged on the left. Although we initially considered the possibility of situs inversus, this
appears to be extremely rare58,126. By going back to the original grids that had been prepared
for EM and comparing ultrastructural features to the registered image data set we conclude
instead that FAFB14 was digitally inverted during image acquisition. Unfortunately at this
point in time mirroring the FAFB14 volume, FlyWire segmentation and other associated data
would introduce many complications for analysis. We therefore corrected the ‘left’ and ‘right’
labels so that they match the true biological side; these are used throughout this work, all
other FlyWire papers and used in codex.flywire.ai and the FAFB-FlyWire CATMAID space.
For consistency with the data set as it can be viewed in neuroglancer or other viewers and
with previously published FAFB work, images in this paper and its companion papers retain
the original image orientation i.e. they are mirrored relative to the ‘true’ fly brain (Figure
S2.2).
For neuronal data that might be asymmetric, the dataset can still be mirrored for
display or analysis e.g. when comparing with other data sets, such as the hemibrain. We
have built tools to enable users to digitally mirror FAFB-FlyWire data using the Python
flybrains or natverse nat.jrcbrains packages (Figure S2.2C). In more detail, since the
hemibrain and FAFB datasets are different shapes a non-rigid transform already exists
between them. This passes via the symmetric JRC2018F light level template127. Therefore if
you wish to superimpose the (true) RHS of hemibrain and FAFB you can use the existing
transforms,
but
apply
a
simple
mirror
flip
within
the
JRC2018F
space.
The
nat.jrcbrains::mirror_fafb() function basically does FAFB -> JRC2018F ->
horizontal flip in JRC1018F -> FAFB. The navis.mirror_brain function applies almost
exactly the same transformation by fitting a thin plate spline landmarks transformation.

We also provide a neuroglancer scene in which both flywire and hemibrain data is
displayed in the correct orientation: https://tinyurl.com/flywirehbflip. The hemibrain neurons
have been non-rigidly mapped onto FAFB’s (true) RHS and then both FAFB and hemibrain
data have been flipped along the X axis. In this scene a frontal view has both FAFB and
hemibrain (true) RHS to the left of the screen. By default the scene displays the SA1 and
SA2 neurons which target the right asymmetric body for both flywire and the hemibrain,
confirming that the RHS for both datasets has been superimposed. Note that any
coordinates recorded in this scene are necessarily different from coordinates based on the
standard orientation of FAFB.
Morphological comparisons
Throughout our analyses we make use of NBLAST62 to generate morphological similarity
scores between neurons - e.g. for matching neurons between the FlyWire and the hemibrain
datasets, or for the morphological clustering of the hemilineages. In brief, NBLAST treats
neurons as point clouds with associated tangent vectors describing directionality, so called
“dotprops”. For a given query→target neuron pair, we perform a KNN search between the
two point clouds and score each nearest-neighbour pair by their distance and the dot
product of their vector. These are then summed up to compute the final query→target
NBLAST score. It is important to note that direction of the NBLAST matters, i.e. NBLASTing
neurons A→B ≠B→A. Unless otherwise noted, we use the mean of the forward and reverse
NBLAST scores.
The NBLAST algorithm is implemented in both navis and the natverse (see Table 1).
However, we modified the navis implementation for more efficient parallel computation in
order to scale to pools of more than 100k neurons. For example, the all-by-all NBLAST
matrix for the full 128k Flywire neurons alone occupies over 500GB of memory (32bit floats).
Most of the large NBLASTs were run on a single cluster node with 112 CPUs and 1TB RAM
provided by the MRC LMB Scientific Computing group, and took between 1 and 2 days (wall
time) to complete.
Below we provide recipes for the various NBLASTs used in this paper:
FlyWire all-by-all NBLAST
For this NBLAST, we first generated skeletons using the L2 cache. In brief: underlying the
Flywire segmentation is an octree data structure where level 0 represents supervoxels which
are then agglomerated over higher levels128. The second layer (L2) in this octree represents
neurons as chunks of roughly 4x4x10μm in size which is sufficiently detailed for NBLAST.
The L2 cache holds precomputed information for each L2 chunk, including a representative
x/y/z coordinate in space. We used the x/y/z coordinates and connectivity between chunks to
generate skeletons for all FlyWire neurons (implemented in fafbseg; see Table 1). Skeletons
were then pruned to remove side branches smaller than 5 microns. From those skeletons we
generated the dotprops for NBLAST using navis.
Before the NBLAST, we additionally transformed dotprops to the same space by mirroring
those from neurons with side right onto the left. The NBLAST was then run only in forward
direction (query→target) but because the resulting matrix was symmetrical we could
generate mean NBLAST scores using the transposed matrix: (A + AT) / 2.

This NBLAST was used to find left/right neuron pairs, define (hemi-)lineages and run the
morphology group clustering.
FlyWire - hemibrain NBLAST
For FlyWire, we re-used the dotprops generated for the all-by-all NBLAST (see previous
section). To account for the truncation of neurons in the hemibrain volume, we removed
points that fell outside the hemibrain bounding box.
For
the
hemibrain,
we
downloaded
skeletons
for
all
neurons
from
neuPrint
(https://neuprint.janelia.org) using neuprint-python and navis (see Table 1). In addition to the
~23k typed neurons we also included all untyped neurons (often just fragments) for a total of
98k skeletons. These skeletons were pruned to remove twigs smaller than 5 microns and
then transformed from hemibrain into FlyWire (FAFB14.1) space using a combination of
non-rigid transforms127,128 (implemented via navis, navis-flybrain and fafbseg; see Table 1).
Once in FlyWire space, they were resampled to 0.5 nodes per micron of cable to
approximately match the resolution of the FlyWire L2 skeletons, and then turned into
dotprops. The NBLAST was then run both in forward (FlyWire→hemibrain) and reverse
(hemibrain→FlyWire) direction and the mean scores were used.
This NBLAST allowed us to match FlyWire left against the hemibrain neurons. To also allow
matching FlyWire right against the hemibrain, we performed a second run after mirroring the
FlyWire dotprops to the opposite side.
Cross-brain co-clustering
The pipeline for the morphology-based across brain co-clustering used in Figure 6 was
essentially the same as for the FlyWire - hemibrain NBLAST with two exceptions:
1.
We used high-resolution FlyWire skeletons instead of the coarser L2 skeletons (see
below).
2.
Both FlyWire and hemibrain skeletons were resampled to 1 node per micron before
generating dotprops.
High resolution skeletonisation
In addition to the coarse L2 skeletons, we also generated high-res skeletons which were, for
example, used to calculate the total length of neuronal cable reported in our companion
paper1 (146m). Briefly, we downloaded neuron meshes (LOD 1) from the flat 630
segmentation (available at gs://flywire_v141_m630) and skeletonised them using the
“wavefront”
method
implemented
in
skeletor
(https://github.com/navis-org/skeletor).
Skeletons were then rerooted to their soma (if applicable), smoothed (by removing small
artifactual bristles on the backbone), healed (segmentation issues can cause breaks in the
meshes) and slightly downsampled. A modified version of this pipeline is implemented in
fafbseg. Skeletons are available for download (see section on Data and Tool availability).
Connectivity normalisation
Throughout this paper, the basic measure of connection strength is the number of unitary
synapses between two or more neurons129; connections between adult fly neurons can reach
thousands of such unitary synapses3. have Previous work in larval Drosophila has indicated

that synaptic counts approximate contact area130 which is most commonly used in
mammalian species when a high resolution measure of anatomical connection strength is
required. Connectomics studies also routinely use connection strength normalised to the
target cell’s total inputs91,129. For example, if neurons i and j are connected by 10 synapses
and neuron j receives 200 inputs in total, the normalised connection weight i→j would be
5%. Gerhard et al. (2017) showed that while absolute number of synapses for a given
connection changes drastically over the course of larval stages, the proportional (i.e.
normalised) input to the downstream neuron remains relatively constant101. Importantly, we
have some evidence (Figure 4F) that normalised connection weights are robust against
technical noise (differences in reconstruction status, synapse detection). Note that for
analyses of MB circuits we use an approach based on the fraction of the input or output
synaptic budget associated with different KC cell types; this differs slightly from the above
definition and will be detailed in a separate section below.
Cell typing
Most of our cell type annotations (87%) are derived from the hemibrain cell type matching
effort (see section below). The remainder was generated either by comparing to existing
literature (e.g. in case of some optic lobe cell types or sensory neurons) or by finding
unambiguous left/right pairs through NBLAST. The latter were given a simple numerical
cross-brain identifier (e.g. “CB0001”) as (temporary) cell type label.
For provenance, we provide two columns of cell types in our supplemental data:
-
hemibrain_type always refers to one or more hemibrain cell types; in rare occasions
where a matched hemibrain neuron did not have a type we recorded body IDs
instead
-
cell_type contains types that are either not derived from the hemibrain or that
represent refinements (e.g. a split or retyping) of hemibrain types
Neurons can have both a cell_type and a hemibrain_type entry in which case the cell_type
should take precedence.
Hemibrain cell type matching
We used NBLAST62 to match FlyWire neurons to hemibrain cell types (see section on
NBLASTs for details). From the NBLAST scores we extracted, for each FlyWire neuron, a list
of potential cell type hits using all hits in the 90th percentile. Individual FlyWire neurons were
co-visualized with their potential hits in neuroglancer (see link in Data and Tool availability
section) and the correct hit (if found) was recorded. In difficult cases, we would also inspect
the subtree of the NBLAST dendrograms containing the neurons in questions to include local
cluster structure in the decision making (Figure S3). In cases where two or more hemibrain
cell types could not be cleanly delineated in FlyWire (i.e. there were no corresponding
separable clusters) we recorded “composite” (many:1) type matches (Figure 3E; Figure
S3G).
When a matched type was either missing large parts of its arbours due to truncation
in the hemibrain or the comparison with the FlyWire matches suggested closer inspection
was required, we used cross-brain connectivity comparisons (see section above) to decide
whether to adjust (split or merge) the type. A merge of two or more hemibrain types was
recorded as e.g. “SIP078,SIP080” while a split would be recorded as “PS090a” and

“PS090b” (i.e. with a lower-case letter as suffix). In rare cases where we were able to find a
match for an untyped hemibrain neuron, we would record the hemibrain body ID as cell type.
Finally, the hemibrain introduced the concept of “morphology types” and “connectivity
types”3. The latter represent refinements of the former and differ only in their connectivity.
For example, morphology type SAD051 splits into two connectivity types: SAD051_a and
SAD051_b, where the _{letter} indicates that these are connectivity types. Throughout our
FlyWire↔hemibrain matching efforts we found connectivity types hard to reproduce and our
default approach was to match only up to the morphology type. In some cases, e.g. antennal
lobe local neuron types like lLN2P_a and lLN2P_b, we were able to find the corresponding
neurons in Flywire.
We note that in numerous cases that we reviewed but remain unmatched we
encountered what we call ambiguous “daisy-chains”: imagine 4 fairly similar cell types, A, B,
C, and D. Often these adjacent cell types represent a spectrum of morphologies where A is
similar to B, B is similar to C and C is similar to D. The problem now is that we can’t
unambiguously tell A from B, B from C and C from D. But at the same time A and D (on
opposite ends of the spectrum) are so dissimilar that we would not expect to class them as
the same cell type. These kinds of graded or continuous variation have been observed in a
number of locations in the mammalian nervous system and represent one of the classic
complications of cell typing33. Absent other compelling information that can clearly separate
these groups, the only reasonable option would seem to be to lump them together. Since this
would erase numerous proposed hemibrain cell types, the de facto standard for the fly brain,
we have been conservative about making these changes pending analysis of additional
connectome data3.
Hemibrain typing with connectivity
In our hemibrain type matching efforts about 10% of cell types could not be matched 1:1. In
these cases we used across-dataset connectivity clustering (e.g. to confirm the split of a
hemibrain type or a merger of multiple cell types). To generate distances, we first produced
separate adjacency matrices for each of the three hemispheres (FlyWire left, right and
hemibrain). In these matrices, each row is a query neuron and each column is an up- or
downstream cell type; the values are the connection weights (i.e. number of synapses). We
then combine the three matrices along the first axis (rows) and keep only the cell types
(columns)
which
have been cross-identified in all hemispheres. From the resulting
observation vector we calculate a pairwise cosine distance. It is important to note that this
connectivity clustering depends absolutely on the existence of a corpus of shared labels
between the two datasets – without such shared labels, which were initially defined by
morphological matching as described above, connectivity matching cannot function.
This pipeline is implemented in the coconatfly package (see Table 1), which provides a
streamlined interface to carry out such clustering. For example the following command can
be used to see if the types given to a selection of neurons in the Lateral Accessory Lobe
(LAL) are robust.

Defining robust cross-brain cell types
In Figure 6 we used two kinds of distance metrics calculated from connectivity (used for
FC1-3; Figure 6E-G) or a combination of morphology + connectivity (used for FB1-9; Figure
6H-K) to help define robust cross-brain cell types. The connectivity distance is as described
above. The combined morphology + connectivity distances were generated by taking the
sum of the connectivity and NBLAST distances. Connectivity-only works well in case of cell
types that don’t overlap in space but instead tile a neuropil. For cell types that are expected
to overlap in space we find that adding NBLAST distances is a useful constraint to avoid
mixing of otherwise clearly different cells. From the distances we generated a dendrogram
representation using the Ward algorithm and then extracted the smallest possible clusters
that satisfy two criteria:
1.
Each cluster must contain neurons from all three hemispheres (hemibrain, FlyWire
right and FlyWire left).
2.
Within each cluster, the number of neurons from each hemisphere must be
approximately equal.
The resulting groups were then manually reviewed.
Availability via CATMAID Spaces
To increase the accessibility and reach of the annotated FlyWire connectome, meshes of
proofread FlyWire neurons and synapses were skeletonized and imported into CATMAID, a
widely used web-based tool for collaborative tracing, annotation, and analysis of large-scale
neuronal anatomy datasets (https://catmaid.org129,131; Figure S7). Spatial annotations like
skeletons are modelled using PostGIS data types, a PostgreSQL extension that is popular in
the Geographic Information System community. This allows us to reuse many existing tools
to work with large spatial datasets, e.g. indexes, spatial queries and mesh representation.

downsampled (ds=4), and imported into CATMAID, resulting in 177,418,713 treenodes. To
reduce import time, skeletons were imported into CATMAID directly as database inserts via
SQL, rather than through public RESTful APIs. FlyWire root IDs are available as metadata
for each neuron, facilitating interchange with related resources such as FlyWire Codex1.
Synapses attached to reconstructed neurons were imported as CATMAID connector objects
and attached to neuron skeletons by doing a PostgreSQL query to find the nearest node on
each of the partner skeletons. Connector objects only were linked to postsynaptic partners if
the downstream neuron was in the proofread data release (177,471,255 connections from
the 130,105,549 synapses with at least one partner in the proofread set).
Synapse counts
Insect synapses are polyadic, i.e. each presynaptic site can be associated with multiple
postsynaptic sites. In contrast to the Janelia hemibrain dataset, the synapse predictions
used in FlyWire do not have a concept of a unitary presynaptic site associated with a T-bar65.
Therefore, presynapse counts used in this paper do not represent the number of presynaptic
sites but rather the number of outgoing connections.
In Drosophila connectomes, reported counts of the inputs (postsynapses) onto a given
neuron are typically lower than the true number. This is because fine-calibre dendritic
fragments frequently cannot be joined onto the rest of the neuron, instead remaining as
free-floating fragments in the dataset.
Technical noise model
To model the impact of technical noise such as proofreading status and synapse detection
on connectivity, we first generated a fictive “100%” ground-truth connectivity. We took the
connectivity between cell-typed left FlyWire neurons and scaled each edge weight (=number
of synapses) by the postsynaptic completion rates in the respective neuropil. For example,
all edge weights in the left mushroom body calyx (CA) which has a postsynaptic completion
rate of 45.8% were scaled by a factor of 100/45.8=2.18.
In the second step, we simulated the proofreading process by randomly drawing
(without replacement) individual synaptic connections from the fictive ground-truth until
reaching a target completion rate. We further simulate the impact of false-positive and
false-negatives by randomly adding and removing synapses to/from the draw according to
the precision (0.72) and recall (0.77) rates reported by Buhmann et al.65. In each round, we
made two draws:
1.
A draw using the original per-neuropil postsynaptic completion rates.
2.
A draw where we flip the completion rates for left and right neuropils, i.e. use the left
CA completion rate for the right CA and vice versa.
In each of the 500 rounds we ran, we drew two weights for each edge. Both stem from the
same 100% ground-truth connectivity but have been drawn according to the differences in
left vs right hemisphere completion rates. Combining these values we calculated the mean
difference and quantiles as function of the weight for the Flywire left (i.e. the draw that was
not flipped) (Figure 5G). We focussed this analysis on edge weights between 1 and 30
synapses because the number of edges stronger than that is comparatively low, leaving
gaps in the data.

Kenyon cell analyses
Connection weight normalisation and synaptic budget analysis
When normalising connection weights, we typically convert them to the percentage of total
input onto a given target cell (or cell type). However, in the case of the mushroom body the
situation is complicated by what we think is a technical bias in the synapse detection
methods used for the two connectomes which causes certain kinds of unusual connections
to be very different in frequency between the two datasets. We find that the total number of
postsynapses as well as the postsynapse density in the mushroom body lobes are more
than doubled in the hemibrain compared to Flywire (Figure S5B,C). This appears to be
explained by certain connections (especially KC→KC connections, which are predominantly
arranged with an unusual “rosette” configuration along axons and whose functional
significance is poorly understood132) being much more prevalent in the hemibrain than in
FlyWire (Figure S5D). Some other neurons including the APL giant interneuron also make
about twice as many synapses onto Kenyon Cells (KC) in the hemibrain compared with
FlyWire (Figure S5A). As a consequence of this large number of inputs onto KC axons in the
hemibrain, input percentages from all other cells are reduced in comparison with FlyWire.
To avoid this bias, and because our main goal in the KC analysis was to compare different
populations of Kenyon cells, we instead expressed connectivity as a fraction of the total
synaptic budget for upstream or downstream cell types. For example, we asked, “what
fraction of the APL’s output is spent on each of the different KC types”? Similarly, we
quantified connectivity for individual KCs as a fraction of the budget for the whole KC
population.
Calculating K from observed connectivity
Calculation of K, i.e. the number of unique odour channels that each Kenyon Cell receives
input from, was principally based on their synaptic connectivity. For this, we looked at their
inputs from uniglomerular antennal lobe projection neurons (ALPNs) and asked from how
many of the 58 antennal lobe glomeruli does a KC receive input from. K as reported in
Figure 6 is based on non-thresholded connectivity. Filtering out weak connections does
lower K but importantly, our observations (e.g. that KCg-m have a lower K in FlyWire than in
the hemibrain) are stable across thresholds (Figure S5G).
Kenyon cell model
A simple rate model of neural networks (Litwin-Kumar et al. 2017) was used to generate the
theoretical predictions of K, the number of ALPN inputs that each KC receives (seen in
Figure 5K). KC activity is modelled by

The limitations of the model are as follows:
1.
The values in the connectivity matrix
take only two discrete values, either 0 and 1

or
and
. In a way this helps when calculating analytical results for the
1 −α
α
dimensionality of the KC activities. However, it is unrealistic as the connectomics
data give the number of synaptic connections between the ALPNs and the KCs.
2.
The global inhibition provided by APL to all of the mixing layer neurons is assumed to
take a single value for all neurons. In reality, the level of inhibition would be different
depending on the number of synapses between APL and the mixing layer neurons.
3.
It is unclear whether the simple linear rate model presented in the original paper
represents the behaviour of the biological neural circuit well. Furthermore, it remains
unproven
that
the
ALPN-KC
neural
circuit
is
attempting
to
maximise
the
dimensionality of the KC activities, albeit the theory is biologically well motivated (but
see 68,69).
4.
The number of input connections to each mixing layer neuron is kept at a constant K
for all neurons. It is definitely a simplification that can be corrected by introducing a
distribution P(K) but this requires further detailed modelling.
Mapping to the VirtualFlyBrain database
The VirtualFlyBrain (VFB) database2 curates and extracts information from all publications
relating to Drosophila neurobiology, especially neuroanatomy. The majority of published
neuron reconstructions, including those from the hemibrain, can be examined in VFB. Each
individual neuron (i.e. one neuron from one brain) has a persistent ID (of the form

VFB_xxxxxxxx). Where cell types have been defined, they have an ontology ID (e.g.
FBbt_00047573, the identified for the DNa02 descending neuron cell type). Importantly, VFB
cross-references neuronal cell types across publications even if different terms were used. It
also identifies driver lines to label many neurons. In this paper, we generate an initial
mapping providing FBbt IDs for the closest and fine-grained ontology term that already exists
in their database. For example, a FlyWire neuron with a confirmed hemibrain cell type will
receive a FBbt ID that maps to that exact cell type while a descending neuron that has been
given a new cell type might only map to the coarser term “adult descending neuron”. Work is
already underway with VFB to assign both ontology IDs (FBbt) to all FlyWire cell types as
well as persistent VFB_ ids to all individual FlyWire neurons.
