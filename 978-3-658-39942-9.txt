Preface
Books are a reflection of their time in which they were written. Philosophy is “its own time 
comprehended in thoughts,” as Hegel wrote in the preface to the Philosophy of Right. But 
as Hegel rightly recognized, philosophy is always too late to instruct how the world ought 
to be. It can only reflect on what has already happened. Epistemology can contribute to 
critical thinking, it can reveal fallacies, but it cannot prevent the occurrence of errors.
The German version of this book was written during the COVID-19 crisis between 
March 2020 and May 2021, a time when the world was flooded by fake news, conspiracy 
theories, and lies spread by Trump supporters and Covid deniers. Unfortunately, this 
breakdown of truth is not a singular event, but a symptom of crisis in our time. The crisis 
prompted politicians, media experts, and IT specialists to consider how to better detect 
fake news and prevent its spread. But the truth crisis is also a philosophical and epistemo­
logical problem created by media, since it threatens the basis of our worldview, namely the 
belief in an objective truth that exists independently of subjective opinions and collective 
belief. With this book, I want to contribute to the rehabilitation of truth by pointing out the 
causes of post-factual thinking and explaining epistemological fallacies.
I received significant inspiration from the interdisciplinary conference “Post-Truth: 
Perspectives, Strategies, Prospects,” which took place in January 2020 at the KU Leuven. 
At the end of February 2020, together with Peter Klimczak, I organized the conference 
“Wahrheit und Fake im postfaktisch-digitalen Zeitalter” (Truth and Fake in the Postfactual-­
Digital Age) at the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, which resulted in the anthology 
of the same name (Klimczak and Zoglauer 2021). At both conferences, I was able to pres­
ent my reflections on the phenomenon of “post-truth.” I would like to thank the conference 
participants for the stimulating discussions. My special thanks go to Peter Klimczak, who 
was inspired by the ideas for this book and included it in his series “ars digitalis.” Some of 
the central theses of my work were also the subject of discussion in the “Stuttgarter 
Philosophenkreis” (Stuttgart Philosophy Circle), in whose discussion rounds, which took 
place despite the lockdown due to Covid restrictions, my book slowly took shape. I 
received valuable suggestions and hints from Rüdiger Vaas, Harald Lorenz, and Klaus 
Erlach, whose critical inquiries and comments helped to sharpen my arguments.

Introduction
Donald Trump has set an inglorious record as American president. The Washington Post’s 
fact checkers (Kessler 2021) counted 30,573 false or misleading claims during his time in 
office. That’s an average of about 20 fake news stories per day that he tweeted out to the 
world. He downplayed climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, criminalized 
migrants crossing the Mexican border into the USA, disputed Russian interference in the 
2016 presidential election, and claimed, without any evidence, that the 2020 presidential 
election was rigged and that he was fraudulently denied a second term (Kessler et al. 
2020). Trump did not lie just occasionally to disguise facts or to appear in a better light. 
Trump’s systematic lies represent a broad-based attack on truth and contributed to a polar­
ization of American society. The intent was to construct an alternate reality in which cli­
mate change does not exist, in which the American economy is doing better than ever, and 
in which COVID-19 is a harmless cold. Media outlets that exposed Trump’s lies were 
insulted as “fake news media.” In an almost Orwellesque fashion, lies became truths and 
truths became lies (Orwell 1976).
Trump’s disrespectful treatment of the truth and his ignoring of facts is characterized 
by the term post-truth. Some commentators even speak of the beginning of a post-truth 
age, in which truth no longer matters, and knowledge is replaced by opinion and truth by 
narratives. Post-truth is not a new phenomenon, but it gained a new dimension with Trump. 
Unlike political disinformation campaigns in the Nazi and Stalin eras, fake news nowa­
days spreads faster and more effectively through social media platforms and is automati­
cally generated and personalized by bot programs. They can influence elections and the 
political attitude of voters. Post-truth is changing our perception of reality. When facts are 
ignored or no longer matter and emotions take their place, then there are only subjec­
tive truths.
As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the world, so did the lies and fake news about 
the virus. You can protect yourself from viruses with masks and by keeping your distance, 
but no spam filter can protect you from fake news. Lies and conspiracy narratives are con­
tagious. They nest in the minds of citizens, change their thinking, are retold, and shared on 
social media. The post-truth phenomenon is responsible for the decreasing trust in main­
stream media. There is often disparaging and contemptuous talk of the “lying press.” The 

x
truth crisis is thus also a media crisis. People now only trust media that reflect their own 
opinions. Other opinions are no longer tolerated.
The call for regulation of the large tech companies, which do not adequately fulfill their 
duty to delete fake news and hate messages, therefore could no longer be ignored. But the 
problem does not only concern Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Co. The problem was cre­
ated with the new medium of the Internet itself – a medium where people can spread their 
own opinion and where there are no gatekeepers to check news for its truthfulness. Thanks 
to the Internet, we now have access to a wealth of information, but information overload 
has also its dark sides. The invention of the Internet set off an information bomb whose 
fallout spreads in the form of lies, bullshit, and half-truths, contaminating people’s think­
ing. As the storming of the Capitol by angry Trump supporters in January 2021 shows, the 
spread of fake news can also become a danger to democracy.
The aim of this book is to examine post-truth from an epistemological and media-­
theoretical perspective. Considering the attack on truth, we need to reflect on the founda­
tions of knowledge and ask ourselves: What is truth? How can we know it? Does truth 
refer to reality or is it merely a social construction? Do we possess objective knowledge of 
the world or is knowledge always subjective? These unresolved philosophical questions 
create uncertainty in our approach to truth. After all, if there are no objective facts and if 
truth is always relative to a perspective, does it follow that there are alternative conceptions 
of reality? Those who think that truth is relative and socially constructed cannot complain 
when post-factualists like Trump take a different view of truth. If we want to fight post-­
truth effectively, it is not enough to engage in fact-checking and to complain about wide­
spread lying; first of all, we must actively defend the institution of truth. We have to show 
that truth is not arbitrary and not a matter of interpretation, but that there are objec­
tive truths.
In the first chapter of the book, different types of post-factualism are analyzed, and I 
will try to explain why many people think that their own opinions are true. Digitization 
and distorted thinking led to the rise of post-truth. When searching for information on the 
Internet, we selectively focus on content that interests us and that fits into our own world­
view. This confirmation bias is reinforced by the personalization of search engines and 
news feeds. By these mechanisms, filter bubbles are created (Pariser 2011), which block 
critical content and confirm media users in their own opinions. People tend to communi­
cate only with like-minded people. When a group is held together by ideological convic­
tions, peer pressure takes effect, suppressing critical voices and sanctioning dissenting 
opinions. Dissenters, fanatics, fundamentalists, conspiracy theorists, and followers of eso­
teric teachings are then no longer receptive to criticism because they have isolated them­
selves ideologically from the rest of society. They ignore scientific facts and arguments, 
create their own interpretation of the world, and thus screen themselves off from the out­
side world, which they perceive as hostile. Such a social dynamic leads to the creation of 
echo chambers, which, as Cass Sunstein (2017) has shown, contribute to the polarization 
of society and can endanger democracy. In a society where each group lives in its own 
echo chamber, constructive political discourse is no longer possible. Each group defines its 
Introduction

own truths. Truth becomes a group belief. Those who do not share this belief are excluded 
from the group. Hannah Arendt (1968, p. 241) defends the traditional conception of truth 
in saying that: “Facts are beyond agreement and consent.” The truthlikeness of an asser­
tion does not increase with the number of people who agree with it. It is, after all, the very 
characteristic of truth that it holds independently of people and their opinions. When soci­
ety breaks down into rival groups that live in their own echo chambers, hold their own 
truths, and are unwilling or unable to communicate and exchange arguments with each 
other, then post-truth prevails and can lead to the destabilization of society.
Unfortunately, philosophy bears some responsibility for the acceptance of post-factual 
ideas among intellectuals. Chapter 2 presents various philosophical theories, such as rela­
tivism, social constructivism, and scientific constructivism, which have contributed to a 
relativization of truth. These theories assume that truth is a product of discursive practices 
and discourse rules determine what is true and what is false. In doing so, a close connec­
tion between truth and power is postulated: For whoever dominates discourse can impose 
its own truth claims. Truth, according to this view, does not exist outside discourse and 
social practices. Each discourse has its own truths. Such truth relativism, however, has 
disastrous practical consequences, which Greg Weiner (2017, p. 91) couched in the sarcas­
tic question: “If there is no objective truth, how is it possible to say Trump lied?” Trump 
introduced new rules of political discourse and convinced his supporters of his version of 
the truth. He ignores all critical rejoinders because he can always say: Those who do not 
accept my rules of discourse don’t have the right to criticize me. This seems to be a logical 
consequence of relativism, because criticism can only be formulated within discourse. 
Anyone who denies the existence of objective facts is playing into the hands of dema­
gogues like Trump.
But what is truth? How can we determine whether a proposition is true? We will deal 
with these questions in Chap. 3. Various theories of truth have been developed in philoso­
phy, such as the correspondence theory, the coherence theory, the pragmatic theory, and 
the deflationary theory of truth. The correspondence theory supports a metaphysical con­
cept of truth: truth consists in a correspondence between a proposition and reality. The 
other three truth theories deny this correspondence. According to them, truth cannot be 
detached from its linguistic, social, and life-world context. For the coherence theory, truth 
is a holistic property of a belief system: statements are true if they form a coherent system. 
For the pragmatic theory of truth, something is true if it is useful and successful. And for 
the deflationary theory, truth consists merely in an approving attitude of a speaker towards 
a statement. Accordingly, the statement “p is true” expresses the same thing as the 
statement p.
Our common-sense understanding of truth is based on a correspondence theory. We 
check the truth of a statement by comparing it with reality. If we find a correspondence, 
then it is true, if not, then it is false. Fact checkers proceed in this way. However, the cor­
respondence theory is controversially debated in philosophy, because there are some 
strong objections to this theory. In this respect, we face the dilemma of having to choose 
between an externalist, reality-based conception of truth and a contextualist, discursive 
Introduction

xii
conception of truth. I will present a compromise solution in the form of perspectival real­
ism, in which the best of both competing approaches is united. According to perspectiv­
ism, truth depends on the current state of research and is historically variable. What we 
think to be true today may be false tomorrow. But not all epistemic perspectives are equally 
valid. Thanks to scientific progress, we can understand and explain the world today better 
than in the past. Truth is always relative to a theory and a perspective, but is nonetheless 
related to a theory-independent reality which is a neutral arbiter for our conjectures and 
hypotheses. If we want to know how dangerous COVID-19 is, we ask virologists, not 
Covid deniers. If we want to know if there is climate change, we ask climate scientists and 
trust what they tell us. Scientific truths, even if they are only provisional and subject to 
revision, provide an indispensable frame of reference that enables us to interact with the 
world, for example, to combat diseases and develop new technologies.
Chapter 4 examines how information becomes knowledge. There are essentially two 
theories that have different views of information and knowledge. According to the first 
theory, knowledge is a true justified belief caused by a reliable, information-conserving 
process that maps facts into mental representations. For example: When I see a red rose, 
the visual information is transmitted through my eyes and neural pathways to my brain, so 
that I come to know that the rose is red. Unless I fall victim to a sensory illusion or hallu­
cination, I gain a true picture of reality. Social epistemology, on the other hand, advocates 
a different model: knowledge is regarded as a collective belief which has a social status 
(Kusch 2002, p. 109). Individuals can know something only as part of a community (Kusch 
2002, p. 10). Knowledge is thus an institutionalized belief and is socially constructed 
(Goldman 2002, p. 186 f.). According to this theory, a belief is knowledge only when it is 
discursively justified and consensually accepted. A typical social definition of knowledge 
is the following: “any and every set of ideas and acts accepted by one or another social 
group or society of people – ideas and acts pertaining to what they accept as real for them 
and for others” (McCarthy 1996, p. 24).
Against the perceptual model of knowledge, it can be objected that information is not 
simply transferred from a perceived object to the brain. Cognitive science shows that the 
human brain is informationally and operationally closed. Perception is not a one-to-one 
mapping from external reality to the brain. What reaches our brain is not meaningful infor­
mation but neural signals that must be interpreted and thereby acquire meaning (Roth 
1997, p. 108). The brain constructs meanings (Roth 1992a, p. 127). Moreover, the natural­
istic model of knowledge cannot be transferred from perception to other forms of knowl­
edge. The social environment has a great influence on belief formation. Knowledge that 
we receive from the media is second-hand knowledge. Media are not simply technical 
extensions of our sensory organs. Media select, aggregate, and process information and 
therefore do not always produce an objective picture of reality.
On the other hand, the social knowledge model also has its weaknesses. If truth and 
knowledge are based only on acceptance and consensual agreement, relativism will be the 
consequence. For if there are no group-independent truth criteria, each group will have its 
Introduction

xiii
own truths and will live within its own socially constructed reality. The effect be a polar­
ization and fragmentation of society.
I will defend epistemic contextualism that presents a balanced middle position between 
the causal and social models of knowledge. Since knowledge is always context-sensitive, 
social influences play an important role in knowledge acquisition and knowledge attribu­
tion. Contextualism does not lead to relativism, because there are not different truths, but 
merely different degrees of knowledge. Common-sense knowledge is different from scien­
tific knowledge and they represent different kinds of belief. There is no contradiction in 
stating that common-sense and scientific knowledge may refer to the same facts, since 
science merely extends, refines, and specifies common-sense knowledge.
According to social epistemology, we obtain our knowledge in most cases from others: 
from our friends or from the media. However, trust in these sources of knowledge is not 
always justified and can have dangerous consequences. One reason why many people 
believe in conspiracy theories or believe fake news is that they trust these information 
sources without critical reflection. Information based on hearsay is not knowledge as long 
as it has not been checked and confirmed. It makes a difference whether we receive the 
information from dubious Internet sources or from reputable scientific sources. We cannot 
trust what mavericks tell us about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This kind of information is not 
as reliable as what virologists and epidemiologists know based on the latest research. We 
trust not so much the experts as the methods experts use to gain knowledge. People do not 
always judge in an objective and unbiased manner. Hans Albert recommends the method 
of critical examination (Albert 1991, p. 42 ff.) that is most likely to provide objective 
knowledge.
A critical reception of the media requires an open-minded consciousness and a way of 
thinking that does not blindly trust the opinions of others. Knowledge based on mere hear­
say is not reliable. Only information that we have good reason to believe constitutes 
knowledge. Immanuel Kant warns us not to blindly trust others: many people are simply 
too dependent on others or too lazy to think for themselves. Instead they simply believe 
what others say. Kant therefore gives us the advice: “Have courage to make use of your 
own understanding!” (Kant 1996, p. 17) This motto is the central idea of Enlightenment 
and is today more important than ever.

Post-Truth Phenomenology
1.1	
The Brave New World of the Internet
Imagine a world in which information of all kinds is freely accessible, in which news, as 
well as fake news, is disseminated and in which people can communicate their own opin­
ion free of censorship. In this free information market, rumors, gossip, lies, propaganda, 
conspiracy myths, or just plain nonsense circulate. You are surrounded by a flood of infor­
mation and can now choose and read freely what interests you. You will easily lose orien­
tation. For every opinion there is a counter opinion, for every view there is a different 
account and for every truth there is an alternative truth. How can we still distinguish 
between true and false news? Which sources should we trust? How can we gain an objec­
tive view of reality?
This post-truth world is not real yet, but is in the offing to become reality. On the 
Internet and in social media you can find lots of news where you can’t always distinguish 
whether it’s true or false. False reports, fake news and disinformation campaigns have 
always existed, but with the Internet a new medium was created where people can shout 
out their own opinion and where news and rumors spread worldwide immediately. The 
Internet is a source of information that gives us access to the world, but that does not sim­
ply represent the world, but shows an infinite number of perspectives from which the user 
can choose one. If we want to know why there is so much fake news today and why so 
many people believe in conspiracy theories, we have to understand how the Internet and 
social media differ from traditional news media (newspapers, radio, television).
In the traditional media there are gatekeepers who fulfill a filter function and select 
news according to journalistic criteria and transmit them to the recipient. The selection 
criteria are truthfulness, novelty, importance, relevance, emotionality and entertainment 
value. In the ideal case, gatekeepers work as fact checkers and exclude false news. The 
invention of the Internet was celebrated by many people as a media revolution because it

is a free medium without gatekeepers and where news is transmitted unfiltered from the 
producer to the recipient. The World Wide Web promised a democratization of knowledge, 
where information can be accessed freely and without charge. The Internet, it was said, 
would create a new culture, strengthen democracy, and contribute to intercultural under­
standing (Curran 2012, p. 13). Citizens could become news producers themselves, write 
blogs or publish their own online newspapers. At the beginning of the 1990s, in the early 
days of the Internet, a series of manifestos were written that praised the dawn of a new age 
and spread boundless optimism. The net activist John Perry Barlow published a 
“Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace”, in which he called for the freedom of 
the Internet from all state interference, surveillance and censorship:
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, 
economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, 
anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being 
coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, 
movement, and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is no matter here. 
(Barlow 2001, p. 29)
In this utopia the Internet was imagined as a free marketplace of ideas, like the Athenian 
agora, in which direct democracy could be realized (Brin 2001, p.  35; Barbrook and 
Cameron 2001, p. 369). In the virtual community, everyone would be free and equal, 
regardless of color, gender, or religion. Others create the vision of a collective intelligence 
that spans the world like a global brain (Lévy 1999; Halpin et al. 2014, p. 28). The “wis­
dom of the crowds” (Surowiecki 2004) would be more than the sum of all individual intel­
ligences and would create new knowledge from all for all.
Soon after the initial euphoria, the dark sides of the Internet became visible: the digital 
divide, a lack of data protection, cybercrime and a flood of spam, hate mails and fake 
news. Trolls and hate preachers abuse the freedom of the Internet to influence and manipu­
late people’s thinking. With the removal of gatekeepers, the dam that had previously held 
back the worst of the dirt was broken. Frankly speaking, the problems of the Internet are 
already inherent in the libertarian and egalitarian ideology of Internet activists. In this 
utopia a dilemma arises: on the one hand, freedom of information for all is demanded 
(Hughes 2001, p. 82; Chaos Computer Club 2020), on the other hand, private data should 
be protected. Hackers want to make secret information public, but on the other hand they 
do not want to be spied on themselves and insist on their right to anonymity (May 2001, 
p. 61 f.). Those who hack others should not be surprised if they themselves are hacked. 
The demand of hackers “All information should be free” (Chaos Computer Club 2020) can 
also be understood as an authorization of the state for a far-reaching surveillance of its 
citizens.
On the Internet, the users are confronted with a vast amount of unfiltered information 
and have to find their own way through the information jungle. It is not always obvious at 
first glance which news is true and which is false and which sources are trustworthy. The 
Internet users are forced to make a choice and thus become their own gatekeepers. How

are they supposed to distinguish between truth, rumor and false news? The recipients have 
to apply their own selection criteria, which differ from the criteria of traditional news 
media. Their attention will be focused on those news that interest them the most.
People want to be entertained. Rumors, sensational news and fictional stories are more 
exciting and entertaining than political news. They fulfill the expectations of the listeners 
or readers (Bernal 2018, p. 239 f.). Fake news appeals to emotions and instincts. Conspiracy 
theories divide the world into good and evil and reveal the alleged culprits for the evils of 
this world. Rumors are readily retold and spread rapidly throughout the world via social 
media. Internet users want to hear opinions that confirm their own worldview (Tewksbury 
and Rittenberg 2012, p. 86). As a result, media users no longer receive the entire spectrum 
of news and opinions, but focus on specific sites and topics or limit themselves to special­
ized topics and news portals that serve their interests. Consequently, the field of vision 
narrows. Fragmentation and specialization of knowledge can therefore be expected to lead 
to less comprehensive knowledge (Tewksbury and Rittenberg 2012, p. 127). Commonalities 
dwindle, differences increase, and clashes of opinion intensify. A general consensus on 
social and political issues is lost. Each group retreats into its own media niche.
The phenomenon of fragmentation and selective news reception is not limited to the 
Internet. Hardly anyone reads a newspaper from the first to the last page, but picks out 
those news that interests him or her. Football fans skip the politics section and read the 
sports pages first. If someone is mainly interested in celebrity news, she or he will ignore 
the news from the politics section (Tewksbury and Rittenberg 2012, pp.  123, 126). 
Nevertheless, there is a qualitative and quantitative difference between traditional news 
media and news portals on the Internet. In the case of personalized news portals, certain 
topics are sorted out from the outset. The reader no longer has the chance to get to know 
other opinions and take note of other points of view. Many users confine themselves to 
such blogs and discussion forums that correspond to their own political views and inter­
ests. As a consequence, a shielding from criticism and an immunization effect occurs. 
Personalization leads to selective and subjective perception: people only see what they 
want to see and ignore facts that do not fit into their own world view.
Media users tend to consume mainly those media that are in line with their own beliefs 
and avoid media that disseminate a different worldview. This phenomenon is referred to in 
media psychology as “selective exposure” (Spohr 2017, p. 153; Schweiger 2017, p. 96). 
People want to avoid dissonance and contradictions and form a coherent own worldview. 
Therefore, they prefer those media that are ideologically close to them. Michael Oswald 
explains this as follows:
Therefore, people react differently to messages and treat them selectively by ignoring or 
rejecting statements that are contrary to their own beliefs. Rejection occurs because cognitive 
dissonance arises when information or statements contrast with one’s own ideology or when 
they contradict central values. (…) The better a communication frame fits with the worldview 
of recipients, the more likely they are to accept it. (Oswald 2019, p. 16)

Empirical studies confirm this effect (Flaxman et al. 2016, p. 317; Lewandowsky et al. 
2017, p. 358; Kavanagh and Rich 2018, p. 154). In the US, Republican supporters prefer 
to watch Fox News, while most Democrats follow CNN (Spohr 2017, p. 152).

The Google Universe
News portals collect and select news. News reports are edited, summarized, chunked into 
small, quickly consumable pieces of information, accompanied by images and placed in a 
narrative context so that they can be accessed by a mouse click and shared with others 
(Coddington 2019, p. 4 ff.). In most cases, the collectors and editors of news, the so-called 
aggregators, only have second-hand knowledge, which they obtain from other news 
sources (Coddington 2019, p. 45). The filtering and selection of news is usually done by 
editors and internet users can act as their own gatekeepers by focussing their attention on 
specific topics. Besides that, there are also algorithmic gatekeepers. Search engines select 
content according to predetermined criteria and adapt it to the interests of users. Eli Pariser 
describes the effect of personalization as follows: “Ultimately, the proponents of person­
alization offer a vision of a custom-tailored world, every facet of which fits us perfectly. 
It’s a cozy place, populated by our favorite people and things and ideas.” (Pariser 
2011, p. 12).
Google has perfected algorithmic personalization (cf. Hartmann 2020; Zoglauer 2020). 
If one enters a search term in Google, a list of web pages appears that provide information 
on this term. The order of the search results reflects the relevance and importance of the 
pages. How important a piece of information is depends on the user’s interests. But how 
does Google know what value a user attributes to a piece of information? Google founders 
Sergey Brin and Larry Page developed the so-called PageRank algorithm, which deter­
mines the order of search results according to the frequency of clicks and how often a page 
is linked. The personal preferences and interests of the users can be inferred from the 
individual user behavior, e.g. how often a page is visited. The number of clicks thus 
becomes the measure of all things. PageRank is defined by the individual and collective 
preferences. The more frequently a website is linked, i.e. the more other websites refer to 
it, the more popular it is. Robotic programs search the Internet and cookies spy on indi­
vidual user behavior. As a result, each user receives a specific listing of search results tai­
lored to them. Google presents each user a different picture of the world, expressed in the 
order of search results. Since the relevance of a link is defined by the subjective assessment 
of its importance, the users get to see what they want to see.
The Google ranking is determined by one’s own and other people’s surfing behavior. 
Internet pages that are accessed particularly frequently by other users receive a better rank­
ing. And the higher the PageRank, the more popular the page is and the more likely it is to 
be visited. The invisible work done by algorithms does not lead to a democratization of 
knowledge. On the contrary: the Google universe is rather plutocratically organized. 
PageRank represents a symbolic capital that can be converted into economic power. A

higher ranking can be achieved by search engine optimization or by simple “Google 
bombing”, by placing many links pointing to a certain website. By applying this strategy, 
algorithms can be duped and attention can be attained.
When listing search results, Google does not distinguish whether the information pro­
vided is true or false, or whether the sites are trustworthy or not. If you trust Google care­
lessly and click on a link, you run the risk of ending up on a fake news site or being 
redirected to a site of conspiracy theorists or pseudoscientific theories. Gérald Bronner 
(2016) conducted an experiment and typed five terms in Google’s search site: astrology, 
Loch Ness monster, aspartame, crop circles, and psychokinesis. Scientific experts agree 
that these terms refer to pseudoscientific theories. Crop circles are supposedly the work of 
extraterrestrials. Psychokinesis refers to the ability of people to move objects merely by 
the power of thought. Aspartame is a sweetener that is suspected to cause cancer. The 
suspicion is based on a controversial study, but experts reject it as unscientific, because the 
conjecture could never be confirmed.
Bronner evaluated each of the first 30 search results and came to the following conclu­
sion: 97% of the websites comment positively on astrology, 78% suggest the existence of 
the Loch Ness Monster, 70% report on the dangers of aspartame, 87% of the websites 
persuade the reader of the extraterrestrial origin of crop circles, and 84% present psycho­
kinesis as a real phenomenon (Bronner 2016, pp. 24–30). By searching for “astrology,” 
most links refer to pages with horoscopes. If one enters the keyword “Loch Ness monster”, 
one either ends up on tourist sites advertising the Loch Ness myth or is linked to obscure 
You Tube videos with Nessie. And for the search term “aspartame,” Google suggests the 
automatic word completion “poison,” “cancer,” or “neurotoxin,” seducing to a precon­
ceived judgment that is scientifically untenable. The results show that pseudoscientific 
theories are widespread on the Internet and are sometimes preferred by Google over sci­
entific sites.

The order of search results can influence opinions, preferences and purchasing deci­
sions because Internet users attribute greater importance and relevance to the first search

results than to the links further down. Psychological experiments show that elections can 
be influenced by manipulating search engines by directing undecided voters searching for 
information to specific websites that favor a particular party or candidate (Epstein and 
Robertson 2015).
To sum up: Google does not provide a neutral, objective picture of the world, but pres­
ents at best a perspectively distorted view of reality which is determined by the PageRank 
algorithm. Our perception is conducted by invisible algorithmic gatekeepers that direct 
our attention to higher ranked search results and thus unconsciously manipulate us.
1.3	
The Blogosphere
Blogs are another source of news. A blog is an internet publication where an author (blog­
ger) posts an article on the net and encourages comments and an open discussion. Bloggers 
take on the role of journalists, posting news, comments or subjective opinions and thus 
contribute to the diversity of opinions on the Internet. Weblogs are therefore in competi­
tion with traditional journalism. Critics complain about the neglect of journalistic stan­
dards such as objectivity, reliability, impartiality and trustworthiness. In contrast, 
proponents of discussion forums appreciate the possibility of a free exchange of informa­
tion free of filters and gatekeepers (Coady 2011, 2012, p. 144; Munn 2012). David Coady 
regards blogging as a democratization of knowledge through which anyone can work as a 
journalist: “It is a mark of a genuine democracy that anyone can call himself or herself ‘a 
journalist’, and anyone who succeeds in informing the public of things they have a right to 
know is a journalist.” (Coady 2012, p. 162).
Behind the call for a democratization of knowledge stands the idea that we don’t need 
scientists and experts to arrive at the truth. It is said that everyone is an epistemic authority 
and every opinion is worth listening to. But, and this is the problem with post-truth, not 
every opinion can claim authority. There are true opinions and false opinions. False opin­
ions are not on a par with true opinions and cannot claim the same right to be heard. Nicola 
Mößner and Philip Kitcher (2017, p. 4) therefore conclude: “The idea of equal epistemic 
status, across people and internet sites alike, is a myth.”
Alvin Goldman (2008, p. 117) regards conventional news media as more reliable and 
trustworthy information sources than blogs, because fact checking minimizes errors and 
false reports. People communicating in blogs and Internet forums form a closed group of 
like-minded people who mostly keep to themselves and have a preconceived opinion that 
is not critically questioned. They develop a monoperspectival view that lacks a critical 
counter-instance. Counter-arguments are either not recognized or dismissed as untrust­
worthy from the outset (Goldman 2008, p. 119 f.). Goldman therefore considers a critical, 
error-correcting process of reflection to be indispensable, in which arguments and counter-­
arguments are exchanged and weighed up. The philosopher Karl Popper has repeatedly 
pointed out how important criticism and corrective mechanisms are for the process of 
knowledge acquisition:
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

When I speak of reason or rationalism, all I mean is the conviction that we can learn through 
criticism of our mistakes and errors, especially through criticism by others, and eventually 
also through self-criticism. A rationalist is simply someone for whom it is more important to 
learn than to be proved right; someone who is willing to learn from others – not by simply 
taking over anothers’ opinions, but by gladly allowing others to criticize his ideas and by 
gladly criticizing the ideas of others. (Popper 1999, p. 84)
Being open to criticism also means listening to the opinions of other people and not com­
municating exclusively with like-minded people within isolated epistemic bubbles. We 
must have access to reliable information in order to form our own well-founded opinion 
independently of others. Online news media such as blogs that don’t make use of fact-­
checking are not reliable sources of information.
1.4	
Polarization
Empirical studies show that blogs and personalized news portals contribute to a political 
polarization of society. In the USA, supporters of the Republican Party have moved fur­
ther to the right in recent years, while Democrats have drifted further to the left (Tewksbury 
and Rittenberg 2012, p. 141; Schweiger 2017, p. 152 f.). Cass Sunstein explains the phe­
nomenon of group polarization as follows:
The term ‘group polarization’ refers to something simple: after deliberation, people are likely 
to move towards a more extreme point in the direction to which the group’s members were 
originally inclined. With respect to the internet and social media, the implication is that 
groups of like-minded people, engaged in discussion with one another, will typically end up 
thinking the same thing that they thought before – but in a more extreme form. (Sunstein 
2017, p. 68)
Polarization causes an ideological “social distancing”: citizens tend to communicate 
exclusively with like-minded people and no longer with people who have a different opin­
ion. People prefer to associate with groups, in which they are recognized and where their 
own opinion is accepted. One feels part of a group or social movement, shares a particular 
group identity and thus has the chance to be heard and to feel confirmed. Groups increas­
ingly fence off from each other, drift apart and discredit the other side.
Polarization has a self-confirming and self-reinforcing effect. For example, climate 
skeptics do not believe that man-made climate change exists. If you are not yet convinced 
by the arguments of the climate skeptics at the beginning and join one of their discussion 
groups just out of curiosity to learn more about their view, you are entering an epistemic 
bubble in which a one-sided, perspectival worldview is shared. In those forums there is no 
critical debate and no dissenting opinion is tolerated, but rather the already preconceived 
opinion is confirmed and strengthened. People in such groups protect themselves from 
criticism by ignoring objections (Spohr 2017, p. 151). Where critical voices are suppressed 
and no open debate takes place, there is a high probability that undecided people will be 
1.4  Polarization

8
persuaded and eventually become climate skeptics themselves. Sunstein (2008, p. 101) 
describes this phenomenon as follows: “Once they hear what others believe, they adjust 
their positions in the direction of the dominant position.” Many people simply adopt the 
opinion of others and join the group opinion.
The striving for dominance of individual members within an ideologically homoge­
neous group contributes to a radicalization of the group. Those who agitate loudest and 
hold the most radical views are most likely to be heard. Sunstein speaks of an information 
cascade if a particular theory or viewpoint attracts more and more supporters and minority 
opinions spread virally across the net (Sunstein 2008, p. 103 f.). He explains the emer­
gence of an information cascade by comparing it with the spread of a rumor (Sunstein 
2010). If someone in a discussion group starts a rumor, the probability is high that other 
group members will believe in it out of solidarity or due to peer pressure and will dissemi­
nate it not only within but also outside the group. The more sensational and emotional the 
news story, the higher the attention and the more people are attracted to it. Because of the 
lack of moderating gatekeepers, extreme and radical political views can be found in the 
Internet with higher probability than in traditional media. Polarization leads to a loss of 
consensus and reinforces the political fringes.
1.5	
Framing and Narratives
There are subtle psychological mechanisms of influencing opinion. Two of these mecha­
nisms will be presented here: framing and the use of narratives. Framing is a widespread 
phenomenon. Many terms we use in conversation are value-laden, expressing value atti­
tudes, arousing emotions, unconsciously steering our interlocutor’s thinking in a certain 
direction, and suggesting a certain judgment. Media scholar Robert Entman speaks of 
cultural framing (Entman 1993, p. 53). A frame provides an interpretative framework into 
which information is contextualized and which is associated with a valuation. Thus, a 
horizon of meaning is constructed, which gives messages and events a significance. A 
frame determines how something is perceived and interpreted. Depending on whether a 
certain fact is framed positively or negatively, different valuations and emotions can be 
evoked (Kahneman 2011, p. 368). For this reason, frames are often used in political rheto­
ric to influence citizens’ voting behaviour (Oswald 2019, p. 18). Entman describes the 
psychological mechanism of framing as follows:
Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some aspects of a 
perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to 
promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treat­
ment recommendation for the item described. (Entman 1993, p. 52)
Another technique for constructing meaning horizons is the use of narratives. Katrin 
Götz-Votteler and Simone Hespers (2019, p.  108) mention the often-told and almost 
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

9
proverbial story of the dishwasher who works his way up to become a millionaire in the 
USA through his own diligence as an example of a narrative that glorifies the American 
Dream. It does not matter whether the story is true or not. What matters is that it seems 
convincing and believable, and that the listener accepts it as true. Fictional stories are often 
more exciting and interesting than true accounts. They seem more believable because they 
satisfy the listener’s or reader’s expectations. Important criteria for the persuasiveness of a 
narrative are its plausibility, coherence, precision, and probability (Oswald 2019, p. 126). 
A story seems more probable the more coherent it is. It must fit seamlessly into the lis­
tener’s experience in order to be accepted. There must be no contradictions and no cogni­
tive dissonance. Michael Oswald (2019, p. 127) explains how a high narrative precision is 
created by this means:
In particular, a high level of narrative precision is achieved when ideology and the experi­
ences of the recipients, cultural values and current events are interwoven into a whole. In 
combination with cultural-historical narratives, reference to myths or events of the past, reso­
nance can thus be generated. (…) Narrative precision is ultimately not only a measure of the 
‘truth quality’ of a story, but also of the extent to which it corresponds to the logic of ‘good 
reasons’.
Many narratives have a moralizing content. Conspiracy theories often make use of such 
valuations (Götz-Votteler and Hespers 2019, p. 112). According to those theories there are 
dark forces conspiring against the population. In order not to be unmasked, the conspira­
tors make use of camouflage and deception and operate in the background. The goal of a 
narrative is achieved when it is believed and retold. Myths, fake news and invented stories 
can also serve their purpose in this way.
Narratives appeal to emotion, not reason. They want to emotionalize. They are used to 
enforce certain values, perspectives and interpretations of reality. Narratives construct 
their own reality – it is often an alternative reality that entices the listener to accept it as 
reality: “As far as the social media system is concerned, it does not matter whether the 
news is ‘real’ or ‘fake’, it matters whether it fits the narrative – which fits the wishes and 
desires of the people concerned.” (Bernal 2018, p. 240) You cannot tell from a text whether 
it is true or false. To do that, you have to compare it to reality. A narrative can be coherent, 
consistent, and free of contradictions, but still be false.
Narratives and framings are closely related (Oswald 2019, p. 125). A plausible narra­
tive generates a framing because it provides an interpretation frame into which events can 
be placed. A story can be expanded and embellished at will, like a serial novel. The frame 
forms an outer shell or a framework that can be filled with a narrative.
Among media scholars, the thesis is occasionally put forward that facts and fictions 
cannot be so easily separated in journalism, since news is prepared and presented narra­
tively (Hickethier 2008; Klaus 2008). Elisabeth Klaus (2008) justifies this thesis with the 
contextuality of facts. There is common agreement that facts are always embedded in a 
context of knowledge and have to be interpreted on the background of this context. 
Journalists obtain facts from news sources and edit them. For a better understanding and 
1.5  Framing and Narratives

for the correct classification of the news, background information is usually included or 
the news is sent in the form of a report. Facts are, so to speak, the raw material and narra­
tives are the media packaging. Knut Hickethier (2008, p. 362) writes: “Every report of the 
world and its events (if it does not present itself as a table of data) is therefore always also 
a narrative, every news item is – even in its strictly conventional forms of journalistic 
speech – a narrative of the world.”
2
­
Facts, of course, can only be presented from a particular point of view or perspective. 
Events must be interpreted and embedded in a meaning context. But journalists are obliged 
to report as objectively as possible, facts and evaluations must not be mixed. Narratives 
must not replace factual accounts. Otherwise there is a danger that facts will become 
“alternative facts”. Donald Trump in particular is a master of making facts appear in a dif­
ferent light, thereby manipulating his listeners. His rhetoric polarizes people and has the 
effect that his supporters hold increasingly radical views and perceive the world from an 
ideological perspective. This can lead to the creation of filter bubbles and echo chambers, 
as will be shown in the next chapter.
1.6	
Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers
A filter bubble is an epistemic structure in which disturbing influences and dissenting 
opinions are systematically blocked out and the media user is captured in his or her own 
worldview. Filter bubbles can arise when people communicate and discuss only with like-­
minded people. Their formation is supported by a personalized information architecture 
that eliminates unwanted information (Pariser 2011; Schweiger 2017, p. 88 f.; Nguyen 
2020). In this way, a perspectival perception is created that reinforces one’s own view and 
ignores critical voices.
While the epistemic isolation of the subject in filter bubbles is brought about mainly 
passively through algorithmic filters, in echo chambers the flow of information is actively 
directed and manipulated through social interactions by keeping out disturbing influences 
(Messingschlager and Holtz 2020, p. 94). Thi Nguyen defines an echo chamber as follows:
2 The journalistic ideal of objectivity is discussed in more detail in Sect. 2.7. On the difference 
between fact, fiction and fake, see Klimczak (2021).
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

11
I use ‘echo chamber’ to mean an epistemic community which creates a significant disparity 
in trust between members and non-members. This disparity is created by excluding non-­
members through epistemic discrediting, while simultaneously amplifying members’ epis­
temic credentials. Finally, echo chambers are such that general agreement with some core set 
of beliefs is a prerequisite for membership, where those core beliefs include beliefs that sup­
port that disparity in trust. (Nguyen 2020, p. 146)
In a way, each of us lives in an echo chamber, albeit in a weakened form. Sometimes we 
are so firmly convinced of our own opinion that we lightly brush aside any criticism and 
counter-arguments. Each of us has a subject-centered worldview and possesses unac­
knowledged biases. In our circle of friends we prefer to gather like-minded people around 
us who share our worldview. In his “New Organon” Francis Bacon explains how prejudice 
prevents us from gaining objective knowledge. What Bacon calls the “idols of the cave” 
are subjectively distorted views, as if each of us lives in a cave and is not interested in the 
world outside the cave:
For (apart from the aberrations of human nature in general) each man has a kind of individual 
cave or cavern which fragments and distorts the light of nature. This may happen either 
because of the unique and particular nature of each man; or because of his upbringing and the 
company he keeps; or because of his reading of books and the authority of those he respects 
and admires; or because of the different impressions things make on different minds, preoc­
cupied and prejudiced perhaps, or calm and detached, and so on. (Bacon 2000, p. 41)
Echo chambers are more stable and harder to penetrate than filter bubbles because they use 
immunization strategies to protect against criticism (Nguyen 2020, p. 153). Echo cham­
bers divide people into insiders and outsiders. Insiders see themselves as possessing the 
truth. They seem to understand what really happens in contrast to the outsiders who have 
a false consciousness and fall prey to systematic deception. Outsiders are therefore dis­
credited and not taken seriously.
Through group dynamic processes, dissenting opinions are deliberately blocked out 
from the discourse. Conformity is strengthened and criticism is suppressed. Echo cham­
bers are particularly common among extreme political groups, terror cells and conspiracy 
theorists (Sunstein 2009, p. 120 f.; Nguyen 2020, p. 148). Some political observers even 
believe that Donald Trump and his supporters live in a cognitively closed echo chamber 
(Hampton 2018, p. 163). Their members remain trapped in a monoperspectival Manichean 
worldview and exercise unconscious self-censorship, taking note only of content that fits 
into their own worldview and excluding all disturbing, incompatible content. Trump sup­
porters cannot be convinced by facts. Even when the falsity of one of his claims is exposed 
and Trump is convicted of lying, his supporters don’t care. They stand firmly by him, no 
matter how much fake news he disseminates (Lewandowsky et al. 2017, p. 354).
Within an echo chamber, rumors and fake news can easily spread and are believed by 
insiders if they correspond to their (inter-)subjective worldview. Echo chambers have their 
own logic and epistemology, in which empirical evidence is irrelevant, scientific findings 
1.6  Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers

are ignored, facts are replaced by narratives, and one’s own worldview is protected from 
refutation (Lewandowsky et al. 2017, p. 362).
1.7	
Conspiracy Theories
Conspiracy theories are particularly well suited to demonstrate the structure and effect of 
echo chambers. Consider a fictional person named Oliver, invented by Quassim Cassam 
(2016, p. 162): Oliver does not believe in the official version of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001. He has read about the 9/11 conspiracy on the Internet and has become 
convinced that the collapse of the World Trade Center was caused by bomb explosions and 
not by the impact of two passenger planes. It was all the work of the CIA, he insists, and 
the highest government circles are involved with the aim to justify the later invasion of 
Afghanistan and the war in Iraq.
Cassam explains Oliver’s false beliefs by his character traits: Oliver is gullible, cynical, 
and biased (Cassam 2016, p. 163). But this is only part of the explanation. Cassam over­
looks the fact that even gullible people are able to recognize the truth if they live in an open 
communicative environment and not in an echo chamber. What is crucial is the epistemic 
position in which Oliver is situated. Let us therefore consider how he arrives at his convic­
tion. Cassam (2016, p. 163) explains it as follows: “In forming his views about 9/11, the 
AIDS epidemic and the moon landing he relies on dodgy websites, paranoid talk radio 
stations, and a narrow circle of eccentric, conspiracist friends and acquaintances.” So it’s 
the Internet, social media, and his obscure friends that lead Oliver to believe in the 9/11 
conspiracy. All it takes to become a conspiracy believer is to land on a website that sows 
doubt about the official version of events: How could the bombers enter the U.S. unchecked, 
pass through screening and board passenger planes? How could two planes bring down the 
Twin Towers? And why was Osama Bin Laden presented as the main culprit shortly after 
the terrorist attacks? Oliver gets curious and types “9/11” into Google to find out more. In 
doing so, he is redirected to conspiracy sites. In discussion forums, he meets other people 
who are firmly convinced that the US government is responsible. Soon he frequents these 
circles and acquires a firm belief that sweeps aside any doubt. His friends encourage him 
in his belief. Evidence that speaks against the conspiracy theory is interpreted as part of 
the conspiracy. In Oliver’s opinion, not only did the government and intelligence agencies 
participate in the big cover-up, but the media was also involved and spreading lies. So 
Oliver is slowly drawn into an echo chamber where there is only this one truth and all other 
people are victims of a large-scale deception or are involved in the conspiracy themselves.
Echo chambers are a social phenomenon. No one is born as a conspiracy believer. It is 
not Oliver’s intellectual character alone or an “epistemic vice” (Cassam 2016) that creates 
the 9/11 echo chamber, but the communicative interaction between him, his friends, and 
the media from which he draws his information. His gullibility, political attitude, and bias 
may predispose him to his belief, but it was the Internet and the social media that con­
verted him into a devout believer.
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

13
The emergence of echo chambers is a typical side-effect of a post-truth society: “An 
obvious hallmark of a post-truth world is that it empowers people to choose their own real­
ity, where facts and objective evidence are trumped by existing beliefs and prejudices.” 
(Lewandowsky et al. 2017, p. 361) In an echo chamber, an alternative reality is constructed 
in which there is no man-made global warming, in which Bill Gates created the Corona 
virus, or in which Barack Obama is a Muslim. It is therefore useful to distinguish between 
a subjective, intersubjective and objective reality. The subjective reality is the world as it 
appears to us. We may be victims of delusion or hallucination. Subjective reality, there­
fore, need not be the same as objective reality. Objective reality is the world as it is 
described by natural science: It is a world made of atoms and elementary particles, in 
which there exists anthropogenic climate change and the Corona virus. Intersubjective 
reality, on the other hand, is a socially constructed world (cf. Berger and Luckmann 1991, 
p. 37). It is the world of which a group of people believe that it is real. Echo chambers 
create an intersubjective reality. That it need not correspond to objective reality is shown 
by the examples of climate skeptics and Covid deniers.
Echo chambers create a directed perception. They provide an interpretative framework 
into which all events are situated and through which they receive meaning. The world 
according to conspiracy theories is double-faced. It is determined by the ontological dif­
ference being versus appearance. The collapse of the World Trade Center appears to have 
been caused by the impact of airplanes, but in reality it was a result of bomb explosions. 
Conspiracists distrust scientific experts, the mainstream media, and government institu­
tions. Intelligence agencies or a covert “deep state” are believed to be involved in all sorts 
of dark machinations and plots. It is argued that Western governments and large corpora­
tions have always acted conspirational and are involved in dirty deals, as it is expected to 
be the case today.
Conspiracy myths always follow the same narrative pattern: there are the conspirators 
who pursue a vicious goal, devise a sinister plan, and have the power to cover up their 
actions by manipulating the media so that the citizens don’t understand what the facts are. 
When the conspiracy is uncovered, the conspirational veil is lifted and all the clues fit 
together like puzzle pieces to form a coherent picture. The facts just need to be interpreted 
accordingly. The conspiracy theorists make use of an epistemology that Hans Albert 
(1991, p. 18 ff.) calls the “revelation model of knowledge”: the enlightened establish a 
monopoly of interpretation which gives them an aura of infallibility that legitimizes them 
to interpret the revealed knowledge which they share with their followers.
This sectarian, quasi-religious nature of conspiracy theories is particularly evident in 
the QAnon movement, which is common in conservative circles in the US. There is a 
prophet who is called “Q” by his followers and wishes to remain anonymous – he is sup­

is hailed as a savior who wants to free his people from the bondage of the “deep state” and 
“Make America Great Again”. Some QAnon supporters identify Trump with Q. The main­
stream media is seen as the enemy, constantly spreading lies and covering up the con­
spiracy. A “great awakening” is predicted that nothing can stop (“Nothing can stop what is 
coming”), which gives the movement an apocalyptic touch. According to Albert (1991, 
p. 18), the religious doctrine of knowledge consists in the idea “that truth is manifest, that 
it is open to view, and we just need to open our ‘eyes’ to ‘see’ it”. To do this, he says, we 
have to interpret the facts “correctly.” Only the believers are able to see through the veil of 
conspiracy, while the unbelievers live in ignorance or do not want to recognize the truth. 
The believers, however, take only those facts into account that fit into the conspirational 
worldview.
Conspiracy theorists have their own criteria to distinguish between truth and fake: 
Anything that contradicts their theory is fake and only the conspiracy narrative itself is 
true. Truth, therefore, cannot be determined by checking whether an assertion is consistent 
with the facts, because the facts or the apparent evidence itself may be fake. Contradictory 
evidence thus does not falsify the existence of conspiracies, but only shows how powerful 
the conspirators are that they can even manipulate the evidence. Anything that speaks 
against the conspiracy thus becomes evidence of its reality.
I would like to explain this immunization strategy using the example of the “Moon 
Hoax”. Some people believe that American astronauts never landed on the moon and that 
the moon landing was produced in Hollywood studios and broadcast as reality TV. It is 
claimed that the Americans were not technically capable of sending astronauts to the 
moon. The television pictures were produced in order to maintain the myth of the techno­
logical and military superiority of the USA over the Soviet Union. As alleged proofs for 
the Apollo conspiracy the following indications are mentioned (see Wisnewski 2005):
•	 On the pictures shot by the astronauts on the moon there are no stars to be seen in the 
sky, which is seen as evidence that they were simply forgotten in the film sets.
•	 The American flag raised by astronauts on the moon fluttered in the wind, even though 
there is no atmosphere on the moon.
•	 The shadows of objects and the astronauts show errors.
•	 The hatch of the Lunar Module is too small for astronauts to pass through in their 
spacesuits, it is said.
Conspiracy theories use the strategy of suspicion: doubts are sown and thus uncertainty is 
created. Yet there is sufficient evidence that astronauts were actually on the moon 
(Eversberg 2013): They brought stones to earth that undoubtedly came from the moon. 
Mirrors were set up on the Moon to reflect laser beams sent from Earth, allowing to mea­
sure the exact distance of the Moon from Earth. Film footage of astronauts walking on the 
moon clearly shows that there is six times less gravity than on Earth. And above all: If 
there had been such a large-scale conspiracy involving thousands of people, how could it 
ever have been kept secret without a whistleblower leaking it?
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

15
Gerhard Wisnewski who wrote a book about “Lies in space” (2005), uncovering the 
Moon Hoax, presents surprisingly simple counter arguments against the alleged evidence: 
In order to simulate the lower gravity on the moon, he says, the film footage was broadcast 
in slow motion. The comparison samples needed to identify the moon rocks are said to 
have come from the Soviet probe Luna 15, which contrary to official reports did not crash 
on the moon at all, but successfully returned to Earth. And the laser reflectors were depos­
ited on the moon by unmanned probes launched by the Soviets. But why would the Soviets 
help their worst enemy to demonstrate its technological superiority? And what about the 
scientists who confirmed the authenticity of the moonrock samples? Were they all part of 
the conspiracy? To the question why the conspiracy was never uncovered Wisnewski gives 
an astonishing answer: because it was more comprehensive than assumed and one should 
not underestimate the intelligence abilities of the American government because it is also 
involved in many other conspiracies.
The defence strategy uses a simple principle: critical arguments are dismissed by the 
assumption of further conspiracies. Everything that speaks against the conspiracy is turned 
into evidence for the conspiracy. In other words, no fact can disprove the theory. Conspiracy 
theories are in principle unfalsifiable.
It may come as a surprise that even in science such seemingly irrational immunization 
strategies are used to save theories from impending refutation. Imre Lakatos (1970, p. 116) 
states: “no experimental result can ever kill a theory; any theory can be saved from coun­
terinstances either by some auxiliary hypothesis or by a suitable reinterpretation of its 
terms”. So-called ad hoc hypotheses, i.e. additional assumptions, are introduced or the 
facts are simply reinterpreted so that they no longer contradict the theory. Does it mean 
that conspiracy theories are not as irrational as they seem at first glance, or does science 
use a conspirational methodology to protect itself from refutation? Sometimes it happens 
that unexplainable phenomena occur which stand in contradiction to an established theory. 
Thomas Kuhn (1970) calls such phenomena anomalies. In some cases an anomaly can be 
eliminated by the addition of an ad hoc hypothesis. Lakatos (1970, p. 100 f.) explains this 
method with the following example:
By using the laws of Newtonian mechanics and the law of gravity, we can calculate the 
motions of the planets with the highest precision. Sometimes, however, orbital anomalies 
are discovered, as was the case in the nineteenth century with the planet Uranus, whose 
observed positions deviated inexplicably from the predicted orbit. Observation and theory 
were at odds. From this contradiction we can conclude: Either the theory is wrong or an 
error was made in observation or measurement. The anomaly could be eliminated by a 
simple additional assumption: Astronomers postulated the existence of another planet 
beyond Uranus, which disturbed the orbit of Uranus by its gravitational force and thus 
caused the deviations. Based on the orbital deviations, it was possible to calculate the mass 
and orbital elements of the new planet. In fact, the new planet, later named Neptune, was 
discovered in 1846 by the astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. But what would have hap­
pened if no planet had been observed at the calculated position? Lakatos speculates how 
history would then have proceeded. Would the laws of celestial mechanics have been 
1.7  Conspiracy Theories

16
discarded because the prediction had failed? Hardly. One might have assumed that the 
planet had been obscured by a cloud of cosmic dust and therefore could not be discovered. 
But even this hypothesis could be tested by sending a space probe to the suspected dust 
cloud, which would then be registered by the probe. Let us further assume that such a 
detection fails. Would the laws of Newtonian mechanics then be falsified? No! Because 
one could add other auxiliary hypotheses to immunize the theory against refutation. For 
example, a magnetic field could have disturbed the probe’s measuring instruments. The 
chain of auxiliary hypotheses could be continued indefinitely.
This immunization strategy was successfully applied in astronomy for centuries: By 
introducing new auxiliary hypotheses, the geocentric worldview could be maintained from 
antiquity to the Middle Ages and preserved from refutation. Thomas Kuhn (1970, p. 64 f.) 
attributes to scientific paradigms a tendency of persistence that protects against a paradigm 
shift: Conceptual categories are remodelled “until the initially anomalous has become the 
anticipated”.
This excursion to philosophy of science shows that conspiracy theories seem to have a 
lot in common with scientific theories. They use the same method to defend their theory 
against objections. However, this should not be misunderstood as a justification or enno­
blement of conspiracy theories. Immunization through the introduction of ad hoc hypoth­
eses, especially when applied repeatedly, is a pathological symptom of a degenerating 
theory development. The auxiliary hypotheses introduced in the planetary example are 
still empirically testable, whereas in the case of the Apollo conspiracy they cannot be 
checked and are self-confirming: Any evidence against the conspiracy is conceived as part 
of an even larger conspiracy. The paranoid worldview can only be sustained by a multitude 
of assumptions and hypotheses, each of which is quite improbable. Even if we grant some 
initial probability to these assumptions, each of which holds independently, mathematics 
tells us that the probability of a conjunction of a large number of statistically independent 
hypotheses tends toward zero (Zoglauer 1993, p. 209). And even if everyone involved in 
the conspiracy is highly unlikely to let the secret out, the more people involved, the less 
likely it is that the conspiracy can be kept secret.
It is surprising that even academically educated intellectuals, and among them are 
respected philosophers and social scientists, are sympathetic to conspiracy theories and do 
not want to call them irrational. They complain that conspiracy theories are stigmatized, 
demonized, and discredited as paranoid thinking by the public and the media (Dentith 
2019; Hagen 2020; Meyer 2018; Thalmann 2019). Behind this astonishing tolerance of 
conspirational thinking lies a postmodern relativism and a general distrust of official gov­
ernment accounts. Kim Meyer quotes the conspiracy theorist Mathias Bröckers as a wit­
ness of the epistemological importance of a “critical conspirology”. She argues that our 
highly complex and conspirational world could only be understood through an “adequate 
conspiracy theory” (Meyer 2018, p.  49). Thalmann (2019, p.  5  f.) and Meyer (2018, 
p. 184 f.) refer to Foucault’s theory of knowledge as a social construct, according to which 
discursive practices and power relations determine what is true and what is false. What is 
true is, according to this theory, what is socially accepted and can be discursively enforced: 
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

17
“Nothing distinguishes the conspiracist from a social critic, the conspiracy theorist from 
the intellectual. It is a question of recognition.” (Meyer 2018, p. 34) One may conclude 
from this that conspiracy theories just need to be generally accepted, then they are true. 
Conspiracy theories are therefore not irrational, but legitimize themselves as “alternative 
symbolic worlds of meaning” (Walter 2014, p. 183), “competing interpretations of reality” 
(Fallon 2019, p. 165), or as “different epistemological commitments” (Jane and Fleming 
2014, p. 128). Conspiracists are thus celebrated as fighters against hegemonic discourses 
of truth. These references to the academic conspiracy literature clearly show how wide­
spread post-factual thinking meanwhile has become among intellectuals and scholars.
1.8	
Science Denial and Pseudoscience
Among conspiracy theorists, but also among anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers, 
scientific expertise is contested. Stephen Turner writes: “expert knowledge masquerades 
as neutral fact, accessible to all sides of a debate; but it is merely another ideology” (Turner 
2014, p. 20). Admittedly, Turner is not an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy believer, but a recog­
nized sociologist of science, which shows that scientific skepticism is a widely held atti­
tude in academia (see Zoglauer 2021). Steve Fuller, another sociologist of science, regards 
expert knowledge as a form of power: “expertise is the most potent non-violent form of 
power available” (Fuller 2018, p. 161). A critical attitude towards expert opinion may be 
justified in some cases, because experts are in principle fallible and their judgment is 
sometimes guided by interests. Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway (2010) show how in the 
United States, from the 1970s to the 1990s, the cigarette industry paid scientists and 
ordered favorable reports to prove that there were no health risks from secondhand smoke. 
Of course, one cannot generalize such individual cases and suspect that experts are in 
general biased and corrupt. But when science is placed under general suspicion and scien­
tific findings are distrusted in principle, we can speak of science denial, which is not only 
anti-scientific but also irrational.
In the COVID-19 crisis, a movement emerged with the anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers 
who questioned the scientific consensus on Covid and called for resistance to governmen­
tal policy in demonstrations. Besides the Covid deniers, there are also climate change 
deniers, evolution deniers, AIDS deniers, and Holocaust deniers who organize themselves 
in internet forums and advocate pseudoscientific theories. For Hansson (2017), science 
denial is a specific form of pseudoscience because it is in opposition to established scien­
tific knowledge. Creationists reject Darwin’s theory of evolution, anti-vaxxers often fol­
low esoteric teachings of natural healing, and opponents of Einstein’s theory of relativity 
persist in the Newtonian worldview, believing that space and time are absolute. Fact denial 
is more than just a skeptical questioning of scientific findings: it is the refusal to take any 
notice of empirical evidence (Washington and Cook 2011, p. 1 ff.).
1.8  Science Denial and Pseudoscience

18
John Cook characterizes science denial by five features, which he explains using the 
example of climate change denial (Cook 2017; Farmer and Cook 2013; Washington and 
Cook 2011):
	1.	 Cherry picking: Climate change deniers selectively pick out those figures and trends 
from the statistical data on global temperature development that confirm their claim 
that there is no anthropogenic climate change, while they ignore or downplay con­
trary trends.
	2.	 Impossible expectations: Another strategy is to shift the burden of proof to climate 
scientists and to apply excessively strict standards of accuracy and predictive power to 
the models. As long as there is no certain proof of climate change, it cannot be taken 
seriously, it is claimed. Farmer and Cook (2013, p. 454) see this as a misunderstanding 
of the scientific method, as climate models are always subject to uncertainty: “This 
strategy misrepresents the nature of science, arguing that we should wait for 100% 
proof before acting. This is not how science operates and is especially not how we oper­
ate in real life when managing risks. To wait for 100% certainty is to never act.”
	3.	 False experts: In order to counter the broad consensus among climate researchers, 
pseudo-experts are cited who hold a different opinion and support the view that there is 
no man-made climate change. The supposed experts usually turn out to be amateur 
scientists or scientists from other disciplines who are not competent in the field of cli­
mate research.
	4.	 Logical fallacies: One argument of climate change deniers is that there has always been 
natural climate change, that the current global temperature increase has natural causes 
and is merely a statistical fluctuation. This is a false inference from an effect to a spe­
cific cause. Farmer and Cook (2013, p. 452 ff.) detect many such false conclusions in 
the arguments of climate change deniers.
	5.	 Conspiracy theories: Science deniers like to see themselves as victims of a conspiracy, 
claiming that the truth is suppressed and that the experts are corrupt or follow political 
interests.
Good science is characterized by objectivity, empirical adequacy, falsifiability, reproduc­
ibility, explanatory power, accuracy, coherence and systematicity. For Popper (2002) there 
is a clear dividing line between science and pseudoscience: scientific theories are falsifi­
able, pseudoscientific theories are not falsifiable. A theory is falsifiable if it is possible in 
principle to find empirical data that contradict the theory. Theories must be able to fail in 
the face of experience. Popper (1962, p. 37) presents three examples of theories that he 
believes are not falsifiable: astrology, the Marxist theory of history, and psychoanalysis. 
Astrological predictions, such as those found in horoscopes, are usually so vague and 
imprecisely formulated that, with a little good will, one can always see them confirmed. 
The same holds of the theory of historical materialism: Marx and Engels predicted a 
socialist revolution, in the wake of which capitalism will be replaced by a dictatorship of 
the proletariat and afterwards by a class-free society. Since no concrete date is given for 
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

19
the announced revolution, this event can be postponed further and further into the future, 
so that the prediction cannot be refuted. Popper also accuses Freudian psychoanalysis of 
avoiding empirical verification. He compares Freud’s theory of the ego, id, and superego 
with Homeric myths, which have little in common with science. Other examples of pseu­
doscientific theories are alchemy, ufology, parapsychology, phrenology, homeopathy, 
Lyssenkoism, esotericism, occultism and Intelligent Design.
Popper’s criterion of demarcation has been criticized because the history of science has 
shown that contradictions between theory and experience do not always lead to the rejec­
tion of a theory; rather, as we have seen, theories can protect themselves from refutation 
and evolve in an “ocean of anomalies” (Lakatos 1976, p. 24). Falsifiability is an important 
but not the only decisive criterion to distinguish science from pseudoscience. To distin­
guish both, it is better not to use criteria for the scientific character of theories but to list 
characteristics of pseudoscience. Besides non-falsifiability, pseudoscience can be marked 
by the following features: anecdotal justifications, simplifications, and also the lack of 
progress, verifiability, criticizability, and reproducibility (Lack and Rousseau 2016; 
Mahner 2007; Vollmer 1993). Often, adherents of pseudoscientific theories are character­
ized by a selective perception that only takes into account those phenomena that fit into 
their own worldview, while contradictory evidence is ignored. Gerhard Vollmer (1993, 
p.  22) sees the lack of critical thinking as the main reason for the inclination to 
pseudoscience:
One feature that is particularly common in pseudoscience is the attempt to protect one’s the­
ory from criticism. This can be done by dogmatic adherence to assertions, by weakening the 
claims (“mostly”), by redefining the terms, or by downplaying the problems. It is also possi­
ble that a theory is constructed from the outset in such a sophisticated way that it cannot be 
tested at all and, above all, cannot be refuted.
What pseudoscientific theories do not lack is their amazing ability to explain phenomena: 
Some esoteric theories even claim to be able to explain everything. It is precisely this 
absence of self-restraint and modesty that distinguishes them from serious scientific 
theories.
Sociologists of science, on the other hand, focus on a different demarcation criterion: 
They claim that the distinguishing feature of pseudosciences consists in their rejection and 
stigmatization as unscientific by the scientific community (Hecht 2018, p. 8). It is argued 
that the standards of science have changed historically, therefore the above-mentioned 
demarcation criteria have no objective status, but are merely the result of a social practice. 
Implicit in this argument is the accusation that scientists, because of their position of 
power, exclude unwelcome competitors and thereby discriminate against them. Frequently, 
this critique of science is also linked with the call to open up to alternative views and to 
accept indigenous knowledge in order to overcome latent eurocentrism. However, if objec­
tive methodological standards no longer count and subjective beliefs, feelings and anec­
dotal accounts are to be recognized as “extended facts”, as Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome

Ravetz (1993, p. 115 f.) demand in their draft of a “post-normal science”, or if an “any­
thing goes” (Feyerabend 1976) is propagated, an anti-scientific trend is created that leads 
to post-truth.
1.9	
Fake News
People with a skeptical attitude towards science and the mainstream media are particularly 
susceptible to conspiracy narratives and fake news. Especially in times of crisis like the 
COVID-19 pandemic, when the citizens are disturbed and are looking for culprits that can 
be made responsible for the crisis, pseudoscientific explanations fall on fertile ground. 
Many people cannot cope with such complexities and are searching for simple explana­
tions. Who knows what a spike protein is and what an R0 number is and how a virus dam­
ages human cells? Rumors circulate: Corona viruses were allegedly bred in a Chinese 
laboratory. Or wasn’t it a secret American lab funded by Bill Gates? Does the Corona virus 
exist at all or is it just a fabrication of our politicians and the “lying press” to restrict our 
basic freedoms in the name of fighting a pandemic? Or it is claimed that the vaccines could 
cause genetic mutations and make us sick. If such fake news is believed to be true and 
becomes entrenched in people’s minds, alternative patterns of interpretation can arise and 
reality is perceived differently.
3

Fake news is not a new phenomenon. It existed even before the invention of the Internet 
(Frank 2018b; Gelfert 2018, p. 90 f.; Gorbach 2018; McIntyre 2018, pp. 97–104; Schmid 
et al. 2018, p. 72 f.). Due to its communicative structure, social media act as a propagator 
3 Various definitions of fake news circulate in the literature. On the question of which of these defini­
tions are adequate see: Zimmermann and Kohring (2018).
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

21
and accelerator for the dissemination of false information (Bernal 2018, pp. 241, 244 f.). 
Trolls are often involved in the spread of fake news, deliberately setting out fake news as 
bait and waiting for gullible people to bite and spreading the message further (Bernal 
2018, p. 228). Fake people can open fake accounts, create a fake profile, and infiltrate a 
social network undetected to influence people’s thoughts and actions. For example, entire 
troll networks and troll farms worked to manipulate the Brexit referendum in the UK and 
the 2016 US presidential election (Bernal 2018, p. 241).
Fake news makes use of a post-truth epistemology: to appear more credible it is embed­
ded in a narrative context and a frame, so that truth and falsity merge and become indistin­
guishable. Fake news creates a feeling of being true. This is why they are also called fake 
narratives. Paul Bernal explains how fake news and fake narratives work:
Creation of a fake narrative is subtler and can be both more dangerous and more damaging. It 
might start with a real story and take it out of context, or show only some parts of it and use 
this to create a narrative that is in essence false, though that falsity is hard to pin down, let 
alone conclusively prove. (…) Fake news can be more ‘believable’ than the real thing: the 
aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction has some logic behind it. When a story is created – 
whether an individual piece of fake news or a fake narrative – it can be worked upon to ensure 
that it is logical, coherent and easily followed. Holes in the plot can be filled. Twists in that 
plot can be signposted and counter arguments predicted and opposed. A carefully crafted 
story is not as messy as reality. It does not have so many seemingly inexplicable warts – so it 
can make ‘sense’ where reality or the real explanation seem counterintuitive. (Bernal 2018, 
pp. 235, 239)
The readiness to believe fake news is based on second-hand knowledge. Regina Rini 
(2017, p. E46) therefore speaks of an “epistemology of testimony”: “A person counts as 
believing a proposition on the basis of testimony when she believes it because the proposi­
tion was presented to her by another person.” Some people trust what they read on the 
Internet or what good friends tell them and they do not critically question a report. 
Untruthfulness is not detected because people do not look closely enough. A report is 
considered credible if it fits coherently into an existing belief system. For example, if a 
supporter of the Republican party who has always been suspicious of Barack Obama and 
has never agreed with his politics hears a rumor that Obama is in fact a Muslim, born in 
Kenya, and is therefore not an American citizen, and thus was never legitimately president, 
he will believe that rumor more readily than a Democratic supporter. The seeds of doubt 
thrive best in people who already possess a biased ideological worldview. Rini calls this 
an “epistemic partisanship” (Rini 2017, p. E50). One is more likely to value like-minded 
friends as trustworthy sources of knowledge than strangers who hold different beliefs, 
which in turn reinforces conformist thinking within an echo chamber.
Fake news and fake narratives have a truth-destroying effect. They entice recipients to 
take false reports as true. However, an increased and systematic dissemination of fake 
news can also have more far-reaching consequences: People or social groups may interpret 
facts and events differently which has the effect that they can no longer distinguish between 
1.9  Fake News

22
true and false, and fall prey to epistemic disorientation. Fake news has the long-term effect 
that news is generally distrusted (Mathiesen 2019, p. 168).
1.10	
Democracy and Truth
Surprisingly, some people do not see fake news as a threat to democracy, but regard it as a 
legitimate expression of free speech. For example, Joshua Habgood-Coote (2019, p. 1054) 
writes: “It is a familiar liberal idea that people have a right to believe what they want to, 
which generates a correlative duty for individuals and states not to interfere with others’ 
beliefs.” If one wanted to prevent the spread of fake news, one would, in his opinion, pre­
vent the free exchange of information. Habgood-Coote therefore sees a thought police at 
work in the fight against fake news and speaks of “epistemic policing”. The term “fake 
news” supposedly stigmatizes and discriminates against people who simply want to 
express their own opinion and their own point of view. Hence the title of his essay, “Stop 
talking about fake news!” He gives the advice to avoid the term at all costs: “If you use 
weaponized terms, you run the risk of hurting people.” (Habgood-Coote 2019, p. 1054).
Like Habgood-Coote, David Coady (2019) also believes that the real danger doesn’t 
come from fake news but from the pejorative use of the term “fake news” and that we 
should therefore stop using this term. Both see it as a discriminatory use of language that 
seeks to discredit and suppress oppositional expressions of opinion. Coady even sees fake 
news in a positive light: media users today have access to more information than ever 
before. And more information means: more true and more false information (Coady 2019, 
p. 51). Therefore, Coady argues, we should be happy about this increase in information. 
The accompanied increase in misinformation seems for him to be a small price to pay for 
the benefit of free access to knowledge: “That’s part of the price we pay, and it seems to 
me that it’s been a price worth paying.” (Coady 2019, p. 51).
One objection to Coady’s argument is this: Free access to more information does not 
automatically lead to an increase in knowledge. This is because information is not the 
same as knowledge (Zoglauer 2020, p. 78). Knowledge presupposes the ability to distin­
guish between true and false information and to place it correctly in a context (Zoglauer 
2020, p. 80). The removal of gatekeepers has fundamentally changed the epistemic situa­
tion of media users. Not only do we receive more false news, in a post-truth world filter 
effects and echo chambers make it increasingly difficult for us to distinguish between truth 
and falsehood. Coady and Habgood-Coote are arguing self-contradictory when, on the one 
hand, they see a “policing device” in the term “fake news” (Coady 2019, p. 40), but on the 
other hand, they themselves act as language police and want to ban the use of this term.
Fake news cannot be justified by appealing to the freedom of information. Anyone 
seeking information wants to receive true, not false information. Fake news is also not 
protected by the right to freedom of expression. After all, its producers do not want to 
contribute to an open and unbiased debate on controversial issues or unorthodox opinions. 
Rather, they seek to prevent free debate by operating not through the means of factual 
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

23
argument, but through the means of deception. The aim here is not to give a voice to 
oppressed groups, but to suppress the voice of truth (Mathiesen 2019, p. 174 f.).
Does fake news pose a threat to democracy? One might think not. After all, democratic 
elections are based on majority decisions. Even if some citizens are misinformed, a minor­
ity cannot decide elections. This argument is based on what is known as the Condorcet 
Jury Theorem. The French philosopher, mathematician, and politician Antoine Condorcet 
(1743–1794) was an ardent supporter of the revolution and a fighter for democracy. He set 
up the following thought experiment (Goodin and Spiekermann 2018, p. 17 ff.): a jury 
consisting of n persons is to reach a verdict. It is assumed that the persons decide indepen­
dently of each other and that there are only two possibilities for the decision, namely to 
judge true or false. If each jury member reaches a true verdict with a probability higher 
than 50%, then the probability of reaching a correct overall decision increases with the 
number of jury members. With two people, there is always a risk that one or both of them 
will make a wrong decision. But with three or more people, the risk of a collective wrong 
verdict decreases. Democratic elections therefore have an equalizing tendency.
However, the result can easily flip as soon as the probability of a single voter making 
the right decision falls below 50%. Then the probability of a wrong verdict by the whole 
jury tends towards 1 when the number of votes increases. Therefore, when fake news 
occurs on a massive scale and influences the opinion of a large number of voters, it may 
well have a damaging effect on democracy. Indeed, the Brexit vote in the UK and the 2016 
US presidential election were influenced by a massive disinformation campaign. Robert 
Goodin and Kai Spiekermann (2018, p. 331) conclude:
False information designed to alter political attitudes is likely to undermine the reasoning of 
otherwise competent reasoners, leading them to incorrect conclusions and to vote in incorrect 
ways. Political lies, after all, attempt to change the way people behave in the voting booth. If 
those people are ‘otherwise competent reasoners’ (i.e. voters who would otherwise be likely 
to vote correctly), the lies changing their votes would most often change them for the worse, 
epistemically speaking.
Fake news increases the likelihood that individual citizens will judge wrongly. The more 
fake news is spread and the more citizens believe it, the greater the danger. Perhaps the 
tipping point at which collective opinion tilts has not yet been reached. But this consider­
ation shows how dangerous fake news is. Cass Sunstein (2008, p. 100) sees the increasing 
polarization and balkanization of the public sphere as a threat to democracy:
If the public is balkanized, and if different groups design their own preferred communications 
packages, the consequence will be further balkanization, as group members move one another 
toward more extreme points in line with their initial tendencies. At the same time, different 
deliberating groups, each consisting of like-minded people, will be driven increasingly far 
apart, simply because most of their discussions are with one another. Extremist groups will 
often become more extreme.
1.10  Democracy and Truth

A pluralism of opinion is important for democracy. A healthy culture of debate is based on 
dissent and factual discussion, but also on the ability of rational argumentation and com­
munication. When people live in epistemic bubbles, they are no longer willing or able to 
engage in rational discourse. In a world where each group lives in its own echo chamber, 
everyone will believe they are in possession of the truth. This leads to epistemic relativism, 
in which there are only group-specific views, but no overlapping consensus. John Rawls 
sees an overlapping consensus as a basic condition for a functioning democracy (Rawls 
2001, p. 32 f.). According to Rawls, this includes the recognition of fundamental rights 
and freedoms, the principle of tolerance, a conception of justice that is shared by all, and 
loyalty to state institutions. When everyone lives in a different reality, this overarching 
consensus ceases to exist and democracy comes under threat.
Jennifer Kavanagh and Michael Rich (2018, pp. 21–40) cite four alarm signs of impend­
ing truth decay: an increasing dissent over the interpretation of facts and empirical data, a 
blurred distinction between opinion and factual assertion, the primacy of subjective opin­
ions over objective facts, and a dwindling trust in and lack of respect for once generally 
accepted reliable sources of information. Vincent Hendricks and Mats Vestergaard (2019, 
p. 104) speak of a “post-factual democracy” “when politically opportune but factually 
misleading narratives form the basis for political debate, decision, and legislation.” In a 
post-factual society, citizens cannot recognize the truth, either because they are trapped in 
an echo chamber or because they are inundated with fake news and the truth submerges in 
it. We are not yet living in a post-factual society. But there are dangerous social and politi­
cal trends pointing in that direction, perhaps more so in the US than in Germany. These 
symptoms include the increasing acceptance of conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific 
theories, widespread science denial among anti-vaxxers, covid deniers, and climate change 
skeptics, and the strengthening of extremist groups on both the right and left side of the 
political spectrum.
As we have seen, Coady (2019) and Habgood-Coote (2019) defend fake news by argu­
ing that democracy is based on pluralism of opinion and that there can be no right or wrong 
in democratic elections; rather, the citizens must decide for themselves what they believe 
to be right. In the 1920s, the Austrian legal philosopher Hans Kelsen (2013, p. 103) put 
forward the thesis that democracy presupposes relativism and truth pluralism. For him, 
truth absolutism, i.e. the view that there is a universally valid truth, is autocratic. Dictators 
believe to be in possession of a blissful truth, thinking always to decide correctly, and 
legitimize their leadership with it. Human knowledge, however, is always fallible. 
Therefore, there can be no absolute truths. People, especially politicians and governments, 
can be mistaken. If in a democracy every vote has equal weight, Kelsen argues, every voter 
opinion must therefore also be equally true.

Theories of deliberative democracy see rational discourse as the source of democratic 
legitimacy. Habermas formulates the discourse-theoretical principle “that a regulation 
may claim legitimacy only if all those possibly affected by it could consent to it after par­
ticipating in rational discourses” (Habermas 1998b, p. 259). A democratically constituted 
society is based on the ability and willingness of its citizens to resolve disputes and con­
flicts peacefully through the exchange of arguments and by consensus. Relativism pre­
cludes a free, undogmatic discourse because everyone sees himself in possession of the 
truth. Truth can only be the goal of discourse, but not its starting point.
Jürgen Habermas (1990, p. 58 ff.; 1984, p. 99) counts truth, rightness and truthfulness 
among the basic conditions of discourse. Fake news violates these conditions of a free 
exchange of opinions and thus endangers consensus building. In an essay published in 
2006, Habermas (2006, p. 18) almost prophetically describes the split in American society 
that later became reality under the Trump presidency: “The polarization of world views in 
a community that splits into fundamentalist and secular camps, shows, for example, that 
an insufficient number of citizens matches up to the yardstick of the public use of reason 
and thereby endanger political integration.” Habermas concludes that “a ‘post-truth 
democracy’(…) would no longer be a democracy.” List and Goodin (2001, p. 277) see the 
goal of democracy in the search for truth. Revealing the truth is a powerful tool in the fight 
against abuse of power, corruption and conspiracies. If the truth dies, democracy dies. 
Dictatorships are typically characterized by censorship and state control of the media, 
because dictators want to control people’s thinking and suppress the truth.
In contrast to the Habermasian model of a deliberative democracy, Chantal Mouffe 
(2000) proposes an agonistic theory of democracy. In her view, the objective of a political 
discourse cannot be the creation of a general consensus, but rather, in a pluralistic society 
marginalized groups must be given a voice. Consensus excludes alternatives and only 
serves to stabilize hegemonic power structures, as Mouffe affirms:
It is for that reason that the ideal of a pluralist democracy cannot be to reach a rational con­
sensus in the public sphere. Such a consensus cannot exist. We have to accept that every 
consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power, 
and that it always entails some form of exclusion. The ideas that power could be dissolved 
through a rational debate and that legitimacy could be based on pure rationality are illusions 
which can endanger democratic institutions. (Mouffe 2000, p. 104)
While for Habermas democracy can only function on the basis of a rational discourse 
respecting truth, Johan Farkas and Jannick Schou (2020, p. 155) place rationality and truth 
under suspicion of ideology: “They are not mere descriptions of a world that is already 
assembled and created ‘out there’, but discursive weapons used to intervene and shape 
both the state and future of democracy.” Elsewhere they say: “Democracy (…) is not just

about facts, reason and evidence. (…) It is about affect, emotions and feelings.” (Farkas 
and Schou 2020, p. 7) This assertion grants feelings an equal status as truths. The subjec­
tive experience of disadvantaged groups should be taken into account in discourses just as 
objective facts. But if subjective feelings can outweigh, neutralize or even trump rational 
arguments, then consensus is no longer possible, then the polarization of society is rein­
forced. Instead of appealing to common interests, differences and disagreements are 
emphasized. Mouffe may tacitly accept political conflict or even welcome it as a demo­
cratic struggle, but she does not provide any proposals for a pacification of society. The 
utopian belief in a peaceful struggle seems unrealistic. A dispute can only develop a posi­
tive democratic function if solutions are searched and a reasonable consensus is found that 
is acceptable for all sides. When feeling stands against feeling, or alternative facts against 
empirical evidence, then competing power claims remain, which are fought out by other 
means than good arguments. An agonistic democracy thus becomes a post-factual democ­
racy, in which objective truths are no longer respected and each group lives in its own 
socially constructed reality.

1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

27
Post-truth is a deliberate strategy aimed at creating an environment where objective facts are 
less influential in shaping public opinion, where theoretical frameworks are undermined in 
order to make it impossible for someone to make sense of a certain event, phenomenon, or 
experience, and where scientific truth is delegitimized.
­
6
While bullshitters choose to ignore the truth, advocates of Post-Truth (henceforth, post-­
truthers) are more devious: they are in the business of subverting truth. Also, while bullshit­
ters are disrespectful towards the truth, post-truthers feel threatened by truth, therefore they 
want to undermine or emasculate truth. Bullshitters find truth inconvenient, so they circum­
vent it, although they would have no problem with embracing truth again, the moment truth 
serves them well. Post-truthers are different: their aim is to delegitimize truth, since this is the 
best way to disarm the threat truth poses to them.
To better understand the implications and consequences of post-factualism for our notion 
of truth, we need to compare it to factualism, our common-sense theory of truth. The com­
mon view is that there is a real world and objective facts. True statements are those that 
correspond to the facts. The common-sense theory of truth may be philosophically naive, 
but it gains general acceptance because we can use it to orientate ourselves in the world 
and determine the truth content of assertions. In a post-truth world, on the other hand, we 
can no longer distinguish between true and false statements because facts are no longer 
relevant. This leads to a detachment of the universe of speech from the world. It is even 
possible to create alternative facts and construct alternative realities. In factualism, a lie 
can still be recognized as such by comparing it to reality. In a post-truth world, however, 
such a comparison is no longer possible because facts and empirical evidence no longer 
matter. Post-truth systematically undermines trust in scientific experts, the media and 
political institutions (Cosentino 2020, p. 139).
6 “There are similarities between hot air and excrement, incidentally, which make hot air seem an 
especially suitable equivalent for bullshit. Just as hot air is speech that has been emptied of all infor­
mative content, so excrement is matter from which everything nutritive has been removed.” 
(Frankfurt 2005, p. 43)
1.11  Post-Truth

28
There are various explanations for the emergence of post-truth (MacMullen 2020): One 
can ignore the truth contrary to one’s own knowledge, out of pure naivety or ideological 
delusion. One can also adopt a skeptical attitude and say: we do not know the truth and 
persist in faith and belief. Or one knows the truth, but nevertheless lies and instrumental­
izes truth and lies for political purposes. A fourth option is to retreat to the position: There 
are no objective facts and therefore no definite truths; instead, there are many different 
equally valid truths. I will call these four attitudes truth ignorance, truth skepticism, truth 
cynicism and truth relativism.
Truth ignorance occurs when people are mistaken, misinterpret things or events, or 
have a completely false understanding of the facts. A typical example of a truth-ignorant 
is Cassam’s Oliver (cf. Sect. 1.7), who believes in conspiracies. Out of sheer gullibility, 
Oliver believes what he reads in obscure internet blogs or what his friends tell him. He 
ignores facts that might refute his conspiracy theory or he thinks they are fakes. Thus he is 
epistemically biased and disregards the rules and methods on the basis of which we usu­
ally gain knowledge.
Although truth-ignorants adhere to factualism, they misjudge the truth and are subject 
to a systematically distorted perception of reality. MacMullen (2020) classifies this atti­
tude as “unconscious post-factualism.” Ignorants follow their gut feelings instead of their 
reason and are unreceptive to the truth. Group loyalty contributes to a selective perception 
of the world. All these psychological factors create echo chambers and alternative inter­
pretations of the world, which are promoted by post-factual politics and ultimately lead to 
the consequence that truth is becoming less important. Only the promotion of critical 
thinking and the orientation towards scientific methods of knowledge acquisition can help 
to fight truth ignorance.
Another attitude toward truth MacMullen calls “epistemic post-factualism.” The epis­
temic postfactualist is a truth skeptic who says, “There are facts here, but I have no way of 
knowing them.” (MacMullen 2020, p. 100) When asked for his opinion, a skeptic doesn’t 
want to be pinned down and is likely to waver and talk bullshit. Harry G. Frankfurt (2005, 
p. 64 f.) therefore considers skepticism to be the cause of bullshit:
The contemporary proliferation of bullshit also has deeper sources, in various forms of skepti­
cism which deny that we can have any reliable access to an objective reality, and which there­
fore reject the possibility of knowing how things truly are. These “anti-realist” doctrines 
undermine confidence in the value of disinterested efforts to determine what is true and what 
is false, and even in the intelligibility of the notion of objective inquiry.
The skeptic distrusts scientific experts. This distrust undermines the authority of science 
and leads to science denial. Many truth skeptics argue that even experts disagree on some 
issues, e.g. on the question whether or not man-made climate change exists. And even 
when they do agree, the skeptics say, they are interest-driven and therefore untrustworthy. 
When confronted with the latest scientific findings, they just shrug and say, “Who knows? 
No source can really be trusted, not even the ones that we like.” (MacMullen 2020, p. 110) 
1  Post-Truth Phenomenology

29
The truth skeptics capitulate to the complexity of the world that hopelessly overwhelms 
them. They abstain from judgment or decide according to feeling and group affiliation: 
“For them, politics is fundamentally about identity and group loyalty (and perhaps also 
ideology), not factual accuracy, and there is nothing regrettable or second-best about this 
state of affairs.” (MacMullen 2020, p. 111).
The skeptics prefer to trust friends and good acquaintances. Their knowledge is based 
on hearsay. Facts play no role for them. They judge according to feeling. Due to their indif­
ferent attitude and their inclination of being easily influenced the truth cynic become sub­
missive victims of post-factual politics. The proto-type of the truth skeptic is the undecided 
voter who does not know which politicians he or she should trust and vote for, but is 
nonetheless captured by populist sentiments and then votes against the political establish­
ment in protest. Donald Trump won the 2016 election due to his anti-establishment agenda, 
which mobilized protest voters, who ultimately helped him to win.
Is Donald Trump a post-factualist? One might think that Trump is simply a bullshitter. 
Kristiansen and Kaussler (2018, p. 18) call Trump a “bullshitter-in-chief.” But unlike the 
bullshitter, truth-ignorant, and skeptic, he knows the truth very well and subordinates it to 
his political goals. Trump promotes post-factualism, making it a media strategy and a 
political program. For him, truth and untruth are interchangeable terms that can be read­
justed according to situation and opportunity. His strategy is more than a mere disinforma­
tion campaign. He wants to construct a different reality by social means. In his world, 
there is no climate change, the Corona virus was bred in a Chinese lab, and the 2020 presi­
dential election was won not by Joe Biden but by himself, “the real Donald.” According to 
the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2021, one-third of Americans believe the 2020 U.S. presi­
dential election was rigged, despite any lack of evidence (Del Real 2021).
Trump has an Orwellian understanding of truth: whoever has the power determines 
what is true. Ian MacMullen (2020, p.  105  ff.) calls this attitude “motivational post-­
factualism”. One can also call it truth cynicism. Trump’s typical character traits are his 
anti-intellectualism, his hostility to science, and his lack of respect for truth. Stewart 
Lockie (2017, p. 1) describes this cynical play with truth as follows: “The post-truth politi­
cian manufactures his or her own facts. The post-truth politician asserts whatever they 
believe to be in their own interest and they continue to press those claims, regardless of the 
evidence amassed against them.” This creates alternative facts. The facts are simply 
adjusted to suit the political goals at hand. The truth cynic does not necessarily need to lie. 
There are many gradations of truth, from tendentious reporting, loose handling of the 
truth, creating a false appearance, and concealing important facts, to outright lying, which 
the truth cynic may use to manipulate his audience (Haack 2019).
In George Orwell’s “1984” words are given a new meaning: “War is peace, freedom is 
slavery, ignorance is strength.” (Orwell 1989, p. 6) In “newspeak” the concept of freedom 
no longer exists, oppositional thoughts are eradicated or can no longer be thought. The 
truth cynic does not have to invent a new language or a new grammar. Trump simply cre­
ates a new reality for himself by constructing alternative facts. If a lie is repeated often

enough and spread in politically-affiliated media, it will eventually be believed. A media 
echo chamber is thus created that captures more and more citizens.
In Trump’s case, one may wonder whether he himself believes in what he says. 
Numerous political observers and commentators see Trump as a boastful narcissist crav­
ing for power who cannot tolerate criticism or dissent (Frank 2018a). Members of the 
government who express different opinions are fired. Trump surrounds himself with 
opportunists who don’t contradict but reinforce him in his views. Those who live in such 
an echo chamber, where their own opinion is always confirmed, finally fall prey to 
self-deception.
It would be wrong to limit truth cynicism to Trump alone. Motivational post-factualism 
can be found in both right-wing and left-wing political circles that bend reality to suit their 
ideology. Colin Wight (2018) and Ian MacMullen (2020) blame identity politics for the 
current spread of post-factualism: “Identity politics is a plea for us to give up on any notion 
of objectivity in the sense of trying to remain unbiased. This is because identity politics 
privileges social location over facts. Identity politics demands that we see group loyalty as 
taking priority over facts. Loyalty under identity politics is to the group, not the facts.” 
(Wight 2018, p. 20).
In identity politics, group membership plays a decisive role. Only members of one’s 
own social group are believed to possess an objective view of reality. Standpoint theory 
holds that particular social standpoints and their views, preferably those of an oppressed 
minority, are epistemically privileged (Ashton 2020a; Crasnow 2014). Other viewpoints 
are dismissed as biased or interest-driven, or are assumed to be based on a false conscious­
ness. As a consequence, the truth content of a statement depends not only on the statement 
itself, but also on who is saying something. But if group membership determines what is 
true and what is false, then there exist no longer universal truths that are binding for every­
one; rather, truth becomes a question of group loyalty.
Post-factualism implies the precedence of values over facts and solidarity over objec­
tivity. That means: Facts are viewed and interpreted from a normative perspective. When 
Donald Trump, for example, insults media that report negatively about him as fake news 
media, the term “fake” is for him not a synonym for falsehood, but stands for everything 
he rejects. The line of demarcation is not between truth and falsehood, but between self 
and other, friend and foe. In this way Trump’s Twitter message can be understood:

We have to distinguish between descriptive and normative post-factualism. Descriptive 
post-factualism describes a state or at least a dangerous tendency in politics and society:

Nevertheless, there are recurring theses and attitudes among the various groups and 
advocates of postmodern philosophy that at least come very close to post-factualism. One 
could even claim that post-factualism did not come into the world with Donald Trump, but 
was always latently present in postmodern philosophy. Typical postmodern theses include 
truth relativism, doubt about the existence of objective facts, social constructivism, anti-­
realism, and a critical attitude towards science.
Postmodern truth theory is characterized by C.G. Prado (2018, p. 4 f.) as follows:
Postmodern relativistically conceived truth essentially has it that propositions are true when 
they are sanctioned by established discursive practices and are generally accepted as true. 
Being true is held to be a function of the communal construals and practices of the members 
of a society or culture, construals and practices sanctioned by those individuals respected as 
authoritative figures in those cultures and societies. (…) ‘True’, then, is a description that 
applies only to propositions articulated in a rule-bound, communicative context. This essen­
tial point precludes conception of truth as wholly subjective. That is, it rules out propositions 
8 “I make no claims about how best to understand the variety of theories and philosophies that are 
sometimes called postmodern. I mean only to describe a certain way of thinking that has some affin­
ity to those views and that has been linked with post-factual politics.” (MacMullen 2020, p. 203, 
fn. 20).
1.11  Post-Truth

being true when held or voiced only by individuals and regardless of others’ responses or 
indifference.
Prado refers to Foucault (1980), who postulates a close connection between truth and 
power: Every society represents a “regime of truth” that determines by its discursive power 
what is true and what is false. According to this model, there is no such thing as objective 
truth; instead, there is a “truth war” (Lee 2015) in which each group seeks to impose its 
own view of truth. If one takes this theory seriously, then descriptive post-factualism is a 
consequence of normative post-factualism. Echo chambers function according to the prin­
ciples postulated by Prado: Truth, accordingly, has nothing to do with reality. What truth 
ignorants believe to be true is the product of a group’s social practices, and this group 
makes sure that its members believe in the socially constructed truth. Dissenters are sanc­
tioned. Individual opinions do not count; only the group opinion is binding. The commu­
nity of Trump supporters is held together according to these principles. And Trump is a 
master at using this group dynamic to his advantage. Trump supporters, QAnon followers, 
and other conspiracy believers think as a collective, not as individuals. For individualism 
threatens the stability of the post-factual regime of truth. If there were such a thing as an 
objective truth that was individually recognizable and existed independently of group 
opinion, that would undermine the authority of the group.
­

Postmodern philosophy is confronted with the reproach that it provided the metaphysi­
cal and epistemological foundations for a post-factual politics, even if it may distance 
itself from such a politics. This charge is not entirely unjustified, what can be seen from 
the fact that some philosophers openly defend post-factualism. With the end of grand nar­
ratives, also an end of truth is proclaimed: “Truth is old, outdated, battered by lies with no 
eyes to see, suffering the tragedy of never being heard.” (Koro-Ljunberg et al. 2019, p. 587) 
Giovanni Maddalena and Guido Gili (2020, p. 50) regard truth as an antiquated relic of a 
bygone age that prevents pluralism of opinion and open discourse: “Twentieth-century 
philosophy reached the conclusion that truth always leads, unfortunately, to authoritarian­
ism and violence.” Some postmodern thinkers reject the binary true-false dichotomy 
because it allegedly reflects power structures (Susen 2015, p. 42). Truth claims are inter­
preted as an act of discursive violence that impedes open debate: “truth talk enacts a kind 
of discursive violence” (Alcoff 2005, p. 339). Instead of criticizing and fighting post-­
factualism, it is declared, we should welcome it as a liberating force that resists hegemonic 
9 Susana Salgado (2018, p. 321 ff.) makes a similar point.

33
power structures: “a post-truth world could enable individuals to resist inflexible realities” 
(Koro-Ljunberg et al. 2019, p. 588). The very warning of the dangers of post-factualism is 
interpreted as a kind of panic reaction and “masculine hysteria” (Coady 2019, p. 50; Myres 
2018). Post-truth critics are suspected of subliminal racism: “post-truth criticism runs the 
risk of absolving whiteness of its social status by positioning it as just another victim of 
the post-truth era” (Mejia et al. 2018, p. 112).
Steve Fuller, a leading scholar in science and technology studies and social epistemol­
ogy, praises post-factualism as contributing to a more liberal and democratic society: “I 
believe that a post-truth world is the inevitable outcome of greater epistemic democracy.” 
(Fuller 2018, p. 61) As the subtitle of his book “Post-Truth. Knowledge as a Power Game” 
(2018) suggests, he views science as a power game in which power relations and rules of 
discourse decide what is considered true or false (see Zoglauer 2021). Consensus among 
scientists, he continues, acts as a principle of exclusion that suppresses other opinions 
(Fuller 2018, p. 49 ff.). It may therefore come as no surprise that Fuller is sympathetic to 
the intelligent design movement and advocates a radical truth relativism: for him, truth is 
always discourse-relative. He sides with the “post-truthers” who want to change the rules 
of discourse:
Unlike the truthers, who play by the current rules, the post-truthers want to change the rules. 
They believe that what passes for truth is relative to the knowledge game one is playing, 
which means that depending on the game being played, certain parties are advantaged over 
others. (Fuller 2018, p. 53)
Post-factualism wants to break the power of experts and democratize science: “In a post-­
truth utopia, both truth and falsehood are themselves democratized.” (Fuller 2018, p. 182) 
According to this view, not the experts, but the citizens should decide for themselves what 
is true. As far as his critique of science and his view of truth is concerned, Fuller has a 
political ally in Trump. For Trump has an extremely anti-science stance: during his time in 
office he has deliberately curtailed the influence of expert panels, cut research funding and 
ignored the advice of experts in the fight against the Covid crisis and climate change. 
Trump has – in the spirit of Fuller – changed the rules of political discourse and “democ­
ratized” truth: What is true is what he and his supporters believe to be true. Whoever has 
the power can enforce his own view of truth.
This short selection of quotations shows that some philosophers are quite sympathetic 
to post-factualism or even defend it openly. In the following chapter, I will examine vari­
ous philosophical theories and ideas that advocate post-factualism or at least come close 
to it. Truth ignorance, truth skepticism and truth cynicism can be easily countered. Truth 
ignorance is best treated by critical thinking. The truth skeptic and the science denier have 
to understand that scientific truths, even if they are fallible and provisional, provide a reli­
able frame of reference which is superior to alternative worldviews. And in democracies 
truth cynics can be easily voted out of office. But the greatest challenge is posed by truth 
relativism. Against it only good philosophical arguments can help.

Friedrich Nietzsche: Perspectivism as Post-Factualism
Post-factualism is not only a media and political phenomenon. Philosophical truth relativ­
ism has contributed significantly to the delegitimization of factualism and thus supported 
post-factualism. Friedrich Nietzsche is probably the first philosopher to advocate a decid­
edly post-factualist position, and he influenced many thinkers after him.

But I think that today we are at least far away from the ridiculous immodesty of decreeing 
from our angle that perspectives are permitted only from this angle. Rather, the world has 
once again become infinite to us: insofar as we cannot reject the possibility that it includes 
infinite interpretations. (GS § 374; KSA 3, p. 627)
There are many kinds of eyes. The Sphinx also has eyes: and consequently there are many 
kinds of “truths,” and consequently there is no truth. (UF, p. 67; KSA 11, p. 498)

Even physics is for Nietzsche only one world interpretation among others (KSA 13, 
p. 373). Thus he writes, “that physics too is only an interpretation and arrangement of the 
world (according to ourselves! If I may say so) and not an explanation of the world” (BGE 
§ 14; KSA 5, p. 28). According to this view, logic, too, is merely an instrument for the 
“falsification of all events” by postulating identities where there are only differences (KSA 
11, pp. 505, 633 f.). Nietzsche assumes that there is no privileged God’s eye point of view 
from which we can perceive the world as it really is. We only see the world as it appears 
to us. Our view is always subjectively distorted, biased, and depends on assumptions by 
which we make up the world for our convenience, simplify it, and make it comprehensible. 
In an early writing, “On Truth and Lie in an Extramoral Sense” (TL), Nietzsche describes 
how human beings use concepts and abstractions in order to successfully cope and survive 
in the world. It does not matter whether the man-made image of the world is true or false, 
because illusions can also serve their purpose. The only important thing is that the ideas 
are useful and make our lives easier: “Truth is the kind of error without which a certain 
species of living being could not live. Ultimately the value for life decides.” (UF, p. 75; 
KSA 11, p. 506)
Truth is for Nietzsche “a mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms 
(…): truths are illusions that are no longer remembered as being illusions” (TL, p. 257; 
KSA 1, p. 880 f.). The concepts of truth and illusion, fact and fiction, are therefore inter­
changeable; they have nothing to do with reality. Truth suggests a closeness to reality that, 
according to Nietzsche, does not exist. In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche boasts himself 
that he has abolished the idea of a “true world” (KSA 6, p. 81). Rather, the pursuit of truth 
springs from the desire to become master of the world. Maudemarie Clark (1990, p. 236) 
describes this striving for truth as follows: “What the knower wants is not truth, but the 
feeling of intellectual appropriation or command over the world.” Since the world can only 
be perceived in perspective, truth and falsity can also only be thought of relative to a per­
spective. The idea that there could be an absolute truth that transcends perspective is 
revealed as a delusion.
Nietzsche understands a perspective as a way of interpreting the world. It determines 
whether a proposition is true or false (Hales and Welshon 2000, p. 21). One might think 
that one only has to look at a thing from many different perspectives, to see it with “more 
eyes”, so to speak, in order to arrive at an objective view:
There is only a perspectival seeing, only a perspectival ‘knowing’; the more affects we are 
able to put into words about a thing, the more eyes, various eyes we are able to use for the 
same thing, the more complete will be our ‘concept’ of the thing, our ‘objectivity’. (GM III, 
§ 12; KSA 5, p. 365)
“Objectivity” is put in quotation marks in the above quote, because objectivity is for 
Nietzsche only a relative objectivity. Even if one could change perspective and see with 
many eyes, so to say, nothing would be gained. A multi-perspectival, supposedly objective 
view is also only one perspective among others and must succeed against other

perspectives. The question, which of two world perspectives is more correct, is meaning­
less, “because the answer would require the prior application of the standard of correct 
perception, i.e. a non-existent standard” (TL, p. 260; KSA 1, p. 884). Since for Nietzsche 
there is no criterion for truth and objectivity, it is ultimately success that decides which 
perspective is given preference.
Robert Fogelin (2003, p. 73) characterizes perspectivism by the following statements:
•	 There are a plurality of different perspectives.
•	 Every judgment is made within a certain perspective and is therefore only true within 
or relative to that perspective.
•	 All perspectives are equal, none is superior to others.
•	 The system of perspectives does not contain an Archimedean point or “God’s eye view” 
from which all perspectives can be surveyed and compared.
Nietzsche, however, would disagree with the third thesis that all perspectives are equal. 
This is because utility determines which perspective we adopt. Truth or falsity do not mat­
ter. False assumptions can also be useful: “Not the truth, but the usefulness and suscepti­
bility of opinions has had to be proven in the course of empiricism; it is a delusion, which 
also our present experience contradicts, that the most possible adaptation to the real situ­
ation is the most favorable condition for life.” (KSA 9, p. 565).
Steven Hales and Rex Welshon (2000, p. 31) believe that Nietzsche only holds a weak 
perspectivism, according to which there is at least one statement that is true in one per­
spective and false in another. Weak perspectivism is thus a local relativism that is limited 
to a few perspectives and does not rule out the possibility that there are statements that are 
true in all perspectives. Strong perspectivism, on the other hand, claims that for every 
statement, there is a perspective in which it is true and another perspective in which it is 
false (Hales and Welshon 2000, p. 31).
Alexander Nehamas (1985) accuses Nietzsche of advocating such a strong perspectiv­
ism and objects that it is self-contradictory. For if every statement were perspective-­
relative, this would also apply to the thesis of strong perspectivism itself. Then Nietzsche’s 
theory could not claim absolute validity, but would only be a relative truth:
This view is perspectivism, Nietzsche’s famous insistence that every view is only one among 
many possible interpretations, his own views, particularly this very one, included. But if the 
view that there are only interpretations is itself only an interpretation, and therefore possibly 
wrong, it may seem to follow that not every view is after all an interpretation and that 
Nietzsche’s position undermines itself. (Nehamas 1985, p. 1)
But why would it be so bad if there were no absolute truths? In this case strong perspectiv­
ism would merely be a hypothesis, a sort of thought experiment that one makes to see if it 
can be useful for epistemology. Strong perspectivism is not self-contradictory as long as 
one does not claim that there are truths independent of any perspective. In Nietzsche’s 
2.1  Friedrich Nietzsche: Perspectivism as Post-Factualism

38
view, philosophy should be playful in character, in which one can test daring hypotheses. 
Nietzsche often restricts his theses, provides them with caveats, or presents them as con­
jectures. A contradiction arises only if one declares strong perspectivism as an absolute 
truth. One can understand Nietzsche’s perspectivism as a hypothesis that does not even 
claim to be absolutely true, according to the motto: let us assume that everything is relative 
and then see how far we get with this assumption.
However, it seems paradoxical to claim that there is no absolute truth and to present this 
claim itself as a relative truth and mere opinion. In doing so, Nietzsche feeds skeptical 
doubts and weakens his own position. Kai-Michael Hingst (1998, p. 328) concludes: “He 
asserts something he cannot know if he is right.” Nietzsche is well aware of the problem 
of the self-referentiality of his perspectivism: “Granted, this is only an interpretation too – 
and you will be eager enough to make this objection? – well then, so much the better.” 
(BGE § 22; KSA 5, p. 37) But would Nietzsche not thereby weaken his own position by 
making it a mere conjecture and hypothesis? Doesn’t he make a truth claim with his phi­
losophy? (cf. Hingst 1998, p. 29)
It would be problematic if we were to regard all perspectives as equally valid, with the 
consequence that people could claim whatever they wanted. Such relativism would be 
self-destructive. People could then insist on their own personal truth without even taking 
notice of other perspectives. Dissent would be unresolvable because there would be no 
perspective-­independent standard by which we could compare perspectives and determine 
which truth is “truer.” Each person would be trapped in his or her own perspective. To 
escape this relativism, Nietzsche introduces utility as a criterion for comparison and deci­
sion. Usefulness represents a perspective-independent standard of value against which 
different perspectives can be compared. If two perspectives are in contradiction, the one 
that is more useful is to be preferred: its usefulness is its truth (KSA 13, p. 283).
That which corresponds to the necessary living conditions of the time, of the group, will 
always prevail as ‘truth’: in the long run the sum of opinions will be incorporated into man­
kind, in which it has greatest benefit, i.e. the possibility of the longest duration. (KSA 
9, p. 541)
Nietzsche wants to show that truth in the sense of adequacy to reality and truth as useful­
ness have nothing to do with each other. Often it is precisely the wrong ideas that are 
particularly successful:
The falseness of a concept is for me not yet an objection to it. Perhaps our new language 
sounds strangest in this respect: the question is, how far is it life-promoting, life-preserving, 
species-preserving. I am even fundamentally of the belief that the falsest assumptions are 
precisely the most indispensable to us, that without an acceptance of logical fiction, without 
measuring reality against the invented world of the absolute, self-identical, human beings 
cannot live, and that a renunciation of this fiction, a practical dispensing with it, would amount 
to the same thing as a renunciation of life. (UF, p. 95 f.; KSA 11, p. 527; cf. also BGE § 4)
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

39
Nietzsche doesn’t intend to define truth by means of utility. Usefulness is not a criterion or 
sign of closeness to reality. Nietzsche does not propose the equation truth = usefulness, 
because falsehood can also be useful. Rather, usefulness is for him the more fundamental 
category, while he rejects truth as correspondence. In this pragmatic sense, Georg Simmel 
(1895) explains how truth can be beneficial to life: Certain ideas turn out to be suitable and 
useful for action. The principle of utility acts as a selection principle. The ideas that are 
useful for life are called true, and ideas that turn out to be inappropriate are called false. 
This pragmatic conception of truth coincides with the radical constructivist concept of 
viability (von Glasersfeld 1987, p. 140 f.): viability means something like usefulness, suit­
ability for life, expediency. The individual creates ideas, hypotheses and theories and as 
long as they prove successful, they are viable. Viability has nothing to do with truth in the 
correspondence-theoretical sense. Ernst von Glasersfeld (1985, p. 20) explains this with 
the example of the fitting of a key into a lock: One might think that the reason why a key 
can be used to unlock a door is that the shape of the key matches the shape of the lock, that 
is, that there must be a structural correspondence between key and lock so that we can 
successfully open the locked door. But a burglar does not need a “matching” key to open 
the door. A suitably shaped wire is also sufficient for a successful break-in.
The common-sense notion of truth is a correspondence-theoretical notion. As we have 
seen, viability does not presuppose a correspondence-theoretic notion of truth. Conversely, 
however, falsity can also turn out to be useful, i.e., viable. This is especially true in the 
moral realm. Nietzsche encourages us to admit “the necessity of lies” (KSA 12, p. 354): 
“We need lies in order to achieve victory over this reality, this “truth”, that is, in order to 
live … The fact that lies are necessary in order to live is itself still part of this terrible and 
questionable character of existence …” (KSA 13, p. 193).
But if the pursuit of truth is reduced solely to the goal of usefulness, the question arises: 
what does “useful” mean? And above all: useful for whom? Is there an absolute value 
standard of usefulness or is the assessment of the usefulness of an idea or conception also 
only relative to a perspective?
What is useful can only be judged within a perspective. Nietzsche admits that useful­
ness is “also just a belief, a fiction” (GS § 354; KSA 3, p. 593). He thus relativizes the 
concept of utility and casts doubt on the existence of a perspective-transcending standard. 
If two people hold different views and argue about which view is better or more useful, 
each may insist on his or her own perspective. Agreement will not be possible. Further, 
success and usefulness criteria have only temporary validity: a perspective may be suc­
cessful and prevail for one moment, but may fail in the next. However, if there is no cross-­
perspective standard, Nietzsche’s perspectivism amounts to a radical relativism, according 
to which there are different perspectives, but we cannot say which is the best one. Each 
perspective may claim to be useful and successful. If we assume a competition of perspec­
tives, then it is possible that sometimes one perspective prevails, other times the other. 
Such relativism is anarchic and destructive because everyone can claim to be right and in 
the possession of truth, and there is no authority that can decide. Nietzsche creates the 
2.1  Friedrich Nietzsche: Perspectivism as Post-Factualism

40
image of an agonal struggle for truth, which is in fact a struggle for power. The will to truth 
thus turns out to be a hidden will to power (KSA 13, p. 282):
the methodology of truth has not been found from motives of truth, but from motives of power, 
of the wanting to be superior. (KSA 13, p. 446)
Knowledge works as a tool of power. It’s obvious, therefore, that it grows with every growth 
in power …. (NB, p. 257; KSA 13, p. 302)
then one arrives at this solution: the “will to truth” develops in the service of the “will to 
power”: on close scrutiny its actual task is helping a certain kind of untruth to victory and to 
duration, taking a coherent whole of falsifications as the basis for the preservation of a certain 
kind of life. (UF, p. 247; KSA 11, p. 699)
This striving for power is not simply soberly stated, but explicitly welcomed: “What is 
good? – Everything that increases the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in 
man.” (KSA 13, p. 480) Individuals can be seen as foci of power struggling for dominance 
and supremacy. They act in an affect-driven manner, although affects are also only epiphe­
nomena and creations of the will to power (KSA 13, p. 300). Lust conveys a “feeling of 
power” (KSA 13, p. 291). Ultimately, the will to power acts as the driving force that uses 
affects as a means.
The image Nietzsche describes is disillusioning: we cannot recognize reality. Truth in 
the sense of a correspondence between proposition and fact is an illusion. Facts do not 
exist, only interpretations. Each person has her own “truths.” And the claim to be in pos­
session of the truth is ultimately only a rhetorical means to gain power of opinion. 
Nietzsche’s perspectivism is therefore the prototype of post-factualism.
Morality, too, is in the service of the will to power. A lie is justified for Nietzsche, if it 
serves the preservation or the increase of power. He calls lying and deviousness a character 
trait of “great men” (KSA 12, p. 202): “deviousness belongs to the essence of the elevation 
of man” (KSA 12, p. 550). For “immorality belongs to greatness” (KSA 12, p. 428). The 
great man must place himself “beyond morality” (KSA 12, p. 225). For him, the end justi­
fies the means: “he wants the great aim and therefore also its means” (KSA 12, p. 406). 
Politicians are therefore above morality, beyond good and evil, because: “The state and the 
politician really need a more supermoral way of thinking” (KSA 12, p. 532). Nietzsche 
advocates a Machiavellianism of power and admires “great men” with a strong will who 
make promises to the citizens and thereby enjoy popularity. The character profile of a 
“great man” is described by Nietzsche as follows: He must be “violent, envious, exploit­
ative, scheming, fawning, cringing, arrogant, all according to circumstances” in order to 
be successful (HA I, § 460; KSA 2, p. 298). Even if a politician commits a crime, it can be 
excused, because, as Nietzsche says, “crime belongs to greatness” and “all great men have 
been criminals” (KSA 12, p.  406). The character traits Nietzsche ascribes to “great

41
men” – the use of lies, deviousness, obsession with power, and a willingness to place one­
self “outside morality” – apply in a special way to Donald Trump. Nietzsche thus becomes 
a mastermind and advocate of post-factual politics.
2.2	
Relativism and Incommensurability
Nietzsche’s philosophy was like an ignition spark, which significantly influenced the 
development of relativism at the beginning of the twentieth century and left deep traces not 
only in epistemology, but also in aesthetics and cultural philosophy. Perhaps one day, 
when a retrospective history of ideas of the twentieth century is written, we will speak of 
a century of relativism. It was at the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century that 
many people became painfully aware of the disintegration and dissolution of traditional 
values. The philosophical systems of the past were shattered and a multitude of divergent 
styles and new paradigms rose from the ruins. While many people found this loss of ori­
entation disturbing and frightening, others welcomed the gain of new freedoms and cele­
brated relativism as an expression of pluralism, diversity, and tolerance. Not coincidentally, 
Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity at the same time, in which there is no 
longer an absolute and universally valid frame of reference. There are an infinite number 
of equally valid coordinate systems with which the world can be described equally well.
In analogy to Einstein’s theory of relativity, the American linguists Edward Sapir and 
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1957) formulated a linguistic relativity principle – also called the 
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis – according to which every language expresses its own worldview 
and every person is tied to a particular ontology by learning a language and thinking in 
grammatical categories. Whorf studied the language of the Hopi Indians and found that the 
grammar of this language is fundamentally different from all Indo-European languages 
and that the Hopi describe their world with different ontological categories. The world of 
the Hopi is thus different from the world in which Europeans live. From the Sapir-­Whorf 
hypothesis follows the untranslatability thesis: words or sentences of the Hopi language 
cannot be completely and adequately translated into English because their meaning is 
determined by the culture and worldview of the Hopi Indians, to which there is no equiva­
lent in our world.
In epistemology and philosophy of science, a similar tendency towards relativization 
can be observed. Since the meaning of concepts is always context-dependent, every shift 
in context is accompanied by a change in meaning. This is true not only for the terms of 
our ordinary language, but also for fundamental physical concepts such as space, time, 
motion, etc. After a scientific revolution the meaning of concepts changes. When Isaac 
Newton and Albert Einstein speak of space and time, they mean different things.
There is no God’s eye point of view from which one could describe the world objec­
tively and truthfully, rather, seen from a relativistic point of view, there is a plurality of 
different perspectives, descriptions, and worldviews of which one cannot claim that one is 
better than another. In relativism, there is no truth across perspectives, but only truths in 
2.2  Relativism and Incommensurability

42
the plural that are exclusively valid within or relative to a perspective. The question which 
of two world perspectives is the correct one or better than the other is meaningless, since 
there is no absolute standard of comparison by which to compare the two perspectives. 
Every judgment is made within a perspective and is therefore only valid within or relative 
to that perspective.
Relativism can be described by a simple scheme. Relativity denotes a binary relation 
and means that something is relative with regard to something else: X is relative to Y. In 
conceptual relativism, X denotes the truth of judgments or the meaning of concepts. Y can 
be a conceptual scheme, perspective, language, theory, or paradigm. In ethical relativism, 
X is a norm, law, or moral judgment, which is relative to a society, a group of people, or 
an individual person. Cultural relativism is a special form of ethical relativism, where Y 
here represents a way of life or culture. Culture is seen as the ultimate frame of reference, 
which cannot be questioned further and to which moral norms and values refer. A moral 
norm can be valid in one culture and invalid in another, but it makes no sense to speak of 
an absolute validity of norms independent of a cultural frame of reference.
I want to discuss conceptual relativism in more detail because it plays an important role 
in both analytic and postmodern philosophy and provides the epistemological basis for 
other forms of relativism. Michael Krausz and Jack Meiland (1982, p. 8) explain concep­
tual relativism as follows:
In one of its most common modern forms cognitive relativism holds that truth and knowledge 
are relative, not to individual persons or even whole societies, but instead to factors variously 
called conceptual schemes, conceptual frameworks, linguistic frameworks, forms of life, 
modes of discourse, systems of thought, worldviews, disciplinary matrices, paradigms, con­
stellations of absolute presuppositions, points of view, perspectives, or worlds. What counts 
as truth and knowledge is thought to depend on which conceptual scheme or point of view is 
being employed rather than being determinable in a way which transcends all schemes or 
points of view.
Concepts and their meaning are considered relative to a conceptual scheme. A conceptual 
scheme is a classification system, which is used to structure and interpret perceptions and 
experiences. Here is a quote from Donald Davidson on this topic (1984, p. 183):
Conceptual schemes, we are told, are ways of organizing experience; they are systems of 
categories that give form to the data of sensation; they are points of view from which indi­
viduals, cultures, or periods survey the passing scene. There may be no translating from one 
scheme to another, in which case the beliefs, desires, hopes, and bits of knowledge that char­
acterize one person have no true counterparts for the subscriber to another scheme. Reality is 
itself relative to a scheme: what counts as real in one system may not in another.
That means: a conceptual scheme is like a pair of glasses through which we perceive the 
world, but which we cannot take off in order to see the things as they are in themselves. 
“Objects do not exist independently of conceptual schemes,” as Hilary Putnam (1981, 
p.  52) says. Only with the help of our concepts we can refer to objects, distinguish, 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

43
classify, count, attribute properties to, or establish relationships between objects. William 
James (1959, p. 172) compares a conceptual scheme with a “tally by which we ‘keep tab’ 
on the impressions that present themselves. When each is referred to some possible place 
in the conceptual system, it is thereby ‘understood’.” Conceptual relativism means that if 
we were to use a different conceptual scheme as a basis, the world would look different to 
us, it would be an entirely different world. James suggests for the first time the possibility 
of alternative conceptual systems. Different conceptual systems are conceivable with 
which we can bring sense impressions into congruence with concepts and thus rationalize 
them. James (1959, p. 171) makes the following thought experiment: If we were lobsters 
or bees, we would perceive the world differently and organize our experience differently. 
He concludes that other conceptual categories, even if we cannot imagine them, can be just 
as useful and successful as those we actually use.
The question which of the various conceptual systems is the true or the correct one 
loses its meaning, because truth itself is relative to the underlying conceptual system. In 
this sense, scientific theories are also nothing but conceptual classification schemes by 
which we interpret the world. Thomas Kuhn (1970) calls such an interpretive scheme for 
theoretical world orientation a paradigm. In a scientific revolution, one paradigm is 
replaced by another.
According to Kuhn, different paradigms cannot be compared directly because each 
paradigm represents its own conceptual scheme with which the world is described, ordered 
and quantified. Even space and time are part of this conceptual scheme. In a paradigm shift 
not only the content of a theory changes, but also the meaning of its terms. Kuhn describes 
it as a “displacement of the conceptual network through which scientists view the world” 
(Kuhn 1970, p. 102). For example, the meaning of the terms space, time, and mass is dif­
ferent in special relativity than in Newtonian mechanics (Kuhn 1970, p. 101 f.). Similar to 
the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, we can speak of an untranslatability of concepts. The repre­
sentatives of two competing paradigms cannot agree on scientific matters of fact because 
they use different incompatible conceptual schemes. According to Kuhn, the paradigms 
are therefore incommensurable, that means, “there is no language, neutral or otherwise, 
into which both theories, conceived as sets of sentences, can be translated without residue 
or loss.” (Kuhn 1982, p. 670) The incommensurability thesis is an important feature of 
conceptual relativism. It can be characterized by three theses:
	1.	 Plurality thesis: There is a multitude of different conceptual schemes. There is no abso­
lutely valid conceptual scheme.
	2.	 Relativity thesis: Truth is relative to a conceptual scheme.
	3.	 Incommensurability thesis: Conceptual schemes are incommensurable (incomparable, 
untranslatable).
The incommensurability thesis is stronger than the plurality and relativity theses. For it 
would be conceivable that different conceptual systems overlap and that concepts of one 
system and the other system are intertranslatable and thus the truth of certain propositions 
2.2  Relativism and Incommensurability

44
can be acknowledged in both systems. The incommensurability thesis rules out such a 
possibility. Therefore, concepts are untranslatable. If a proposition p is true in one concep­
tual system or epistemic perspective, this does not mean that it is also true in another per­
spective. And even if it were, the propositions can have different meanings and then, 
strictly speaking, there are two different truths. Similar to perspectivism, we must distin­
guish between strong and weak relativism. The plurality and relativity theses lead to weak 
relativism. Together with the incommensurability thesis we get a strong relativism.
The comparability of conceptual schemes or paradigms is ruled out by the incommen­
surability thesis. Therefore, one cannot say that one system is truer or describes the world 
better than another system. Applied to cultural relativism, one could not compare the val­
ues and morals of different cultures, nor speak of higher or lower cultures. One could not 
even claim that two conceptual systems or cultures are equal or have equal value, because 
even the determination of equality presupposes the comparability of the two systems and 
a common standard of value. Adherents of different paradigms would not be able to com­
municate, they wouldn’t understand each other. It is as if they lived in different worlds.
Weak relativism, the harmless variant of conceptual relativism, asserts only local rela­
tivity, but does not exclude the possibility of overlapping perspectives and partial translat­
ability of concepts. Steven Hales (2006, p. 1) defines his view of relativism as follows: 
“Philosophical propositions are true in some perspectives and false in others.” (emphasis 
mine) This holds at least for some propositions and need not be true for all propositions 
and all perspectives. There can be truths that are acknowledged in many perspectives and 
there may be disagreement only in a few perspectives about the assessment of the proposi­
tions. In this way cultural relativism would lose its rigidity and would not obstruct inter­
cultural understanding and agreement on fundamental issues, because insurmountable 
disagreement would remain only on a few points. Weak relativism is thus the opposite of 
absolutism, according to which all true judgments are absolutely true.
John MacFarlane (2010, p. 129) explains relative truth as a truth that depends on the 
context of judgment: “Relativism about truth is the view that there is at least one judgment-­
sensitive sentence.” According to MacFarlane, one example suffices to confirm the 
assessment-­sensitivity of sentences. He uses the sentence “Licorice is tasty” as a standard 
example (MacFarlane 2014, p. 72). As we all know, there is no accounting for taste. Tastes 
are different. Not everyone likes licorice. Licorice lovers will agree to MacFarlane’s state­
ment; others will deny it. The same is also valid for aesthetic truths. Not everyone will find 
Picasso’s “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” beautiful. Yet, no one will deny that it was painted 
by Picasso. The former is a subjective judgment of taste, the latter an objective truth. 
Merely admitting the subject-dependence of aesthetic judgments does not make one a rela­
tivist. Kant (2007, p. 35) also acknowledged the subjectivity of judgments of taste. Such a 
weak relativism as Hales and MacFarlane defend is therefore not only harmless, it is 
trivial.
Besides strong and weak relativism, we can distinguish local and global relativism. In 
global relativism, every statement is only relatively true and none is absolutely true, whereas 
local relativism allows for truths that hold in multiple perspectives. Locally it would be 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

45
possible that individuals, social groups, or cultures judging from different perspectives and 
on the basis of different conceptual schemes agree on common truths because their perspec­
tives overlap locally. Therefore, members of two cultures might acknowledge the truth of 
simple empirical propositions such as that the sun rises in the east, that a day has 24 hours, 
and that there is a full moon approximately every 29.5 days. This presupposes, of course, that 
the terms east, hour, day and full moon have equivalent meanings in the other languages. The 
incommensurability thesis is much more radical and excludes such a translatability of terms 
or an understanding across languages with different conceptual schemes. Incommensurability 
therefore inevitably leads to global relativism.
The incommensurability thesis was developed independently by Thomas Kuhn and 
Paul Feyerabend in the early 1960s. One of its consequences is that in case of a theory 
change, not only the content of the theory changes, but also the entire conceptual frame­
work. The terms that appear in the theory take on a new meaning. As a result, the two theo­
ries, the precursor theory and the successor theory, are not comparable, they are 
incommensurable, because a profound meaning change occurs, which changes, besides 
the scientific worldview, also the perception and theoretical description of the world. 
Communication between the adherents of the two theories or paradigms is no longer pos­
sible because the semantics has changed. The vocabulary may still consist of the same 
terms, but they are used differently or defined operationally different. The different inter­
pretation of phenomena and experiments leads to an inability of mutual understanding. 
Incommensurability for Kuhn therefore means the untranslatability of concepts and 
theories:
Most readers of my text have supposed that when I spoke of theories as incommensurable, I 
meant that they could not be compared. But ‘incommensurability’ is a term borrowed from 
mathematics, and it there has no such implication. The hypothenuse of an isosceles right tri­
angle is incommensurable with its side, but the two can be compared to any required degree 
of precision. What is lacking is not comparability but a unit of length in terms of which both 
can be measured directly and exactly. In applying the term ‘incommensurability’ to theories, 
I had intended only to insist that there was no common language within which both could be 
fully expressed and which could therefore be used in a point-by-point comparison between 
them. (Kuhn 1976, p. 190 f.)
We can imagine an extreme case of incommensurability if we consider how we might 
communicate with aliens, presupposing that they exist and communication is technically 
possible (Zoglauer 2016). Nicholas Rescher (1999, p. 201) doubts that communication 
with aliens can be established, because they would probably operate with conceptual 
schemes that are completely alien to us, and “the taxonomic and explanatory mechanisms 
by means of which their cognitive business is transacted might differ so radically from 
ours that intellectual contact with them would be difficult or impossible.” In a sense, this 
is also true of terrestrial cultures. Feyerabend (1976, p. 310 f.), in his exposition of the 
incommensurability thesis, points to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which states that differ­
ent languages imply an incomparable conception of the world and a different cosmology.

Meaning incommensurability, according to Feyerabend, leads to ontological incommen­
surability. Untranslatability has the effect that different cultures acknowledge different 
facts: What is a fact in system A need not hold in system B, and vice versa (Feyerabend 
1976, p. 370 f.). The conceptual systems thus describe different worlds:
For one certainly cannot assume that two incommensurable theories are dealing with one and 
the same objective state of affairs (…). If, therefore, one does not want to assume that they are 
dealing with nothing at all, one must admit that they are dealing with different worlds, and 
that the change has come about through the transition from one theory to the other. (Feyerabend 
1976, p. 386)
In incommensurable systems, one cannot think beyond the boundaries of one’s own con­
ceptual horizon. Cultural incommensurability thus leads to an inability to engage in a 
dialogue across cultural boundaries. If one takes the incommensurability thesis seriously, 
we would have to regard members of foreign cultures as aliens, so to speak, with whom 
we cannot communicate and whom we cannot understand. In order to claim that there is 
genuine incommensurability and that an alien language cannot be translated because of 
contextual meaning differences, we would have to know the meaning of alien terms and be 
able to compare them with the terms of our language. But then languages cannot be incom­
mensurable as Feyerabend claims. “On the contrary, if translations were impossible, we 
would not be able to say that and to what extent conceptions differ from one another,” as 
Putnam (1981, p. 117) critically remarks.
When Feyerabend (1976, p. 357 ff.), for example, explains that archaic cosmology and 
more recent cosmology are incommensurable, this shows that he has a profound knowl­
edge of archaic natural philosophy and that it is apparently possible after all to gain a 
deeper understanding of the other culture. Consequently, the languages in which these 
worldviews are described must be at least partially translatable. Donald Davidson (1984, 
p.  184) also emphasizes the contradictory character of the incommensurability thesis: 
“Different points of view make sense, but only if there is a common co-ordinate system on 
which to plot them; yet the existence of a common system belies the claim of dramatic 
incomparability.” If there were indeed incommensurable conceptual schemes, we should 
be able to compare these schemes. But every distinction presupposes a common scheme 
on the basis of which the comparison is made.
Feyerabend understands incommensurability as an all-or-nothing notion: either two 
conceptual systems are incommensurable or they are not. However, if incommensurability 
is explained in terms of (un)translatability, then we have to take into account there are 
degrees of translatability and understanding. The culture of an extraterrestrial life form 
may indeed be so radically different from ours due to biological differences that under­
standing becomes impossible (Zoglauer 2016). But our earthly cultures have so many 
similarities and commonalities that one can hardly speak of incommensurability.
In his later writings, especially in “Science in a Free Society” (1978), Feyerabend 
expounds a “democratic relativism”. In this context he doesn’t speak of cultures, or 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

47
worldviews, but of a plurality of different “traditions” representing different values and 
forms of knowledge. He outlines a vision of a free society in which all traditions have 
equal rights and equal access to the institutions of education and other centers of power 
(Feyerabend 1978, p. 82 f.). Science is for Feyerabend just one of many traditions besides 
natural healing, creationism, astrology and witchcraft beliefs. Each tradition has its own 
values that are unique to it. There is no universal standard for all traditions by which we 
could judge the value of a tradition (Feyerabend 1978, p. 83). We can easily imagine how 
a libertarian society would look like in Feyerabend’s sense: parents could decide whether 
their children would be taught evolutionary theory or creationism at school (Feyerabend 
1978, p. 87). Populists, fundamentalists, and conspiracy theorists would have equal access 
to the media. At this point relativism, which claims to be tolerant of other forms of thought 
and traditions, reaches its limits. For in order to protect traditions and avoid conflict, an 
“efficient police force” is needed (Feyerabend 1978, p. 84). The police force acts like 
zookeepers to ensure that the traditions do not break out of their enclosures and threaten 
other traditions.
Similar to Feyerabend, Carol Rovane (2013, 2016) also argues for a strong relativism. 
Even before Rovane, Feyerabend (1976, p. 371) remarked that there can be no logical rela­
tions between incommensurable theories or worldviews. Rovane (2016, p. 268) agrees and 
puts it this way: “To say that claims are neither consistent nor inconsistent is to say that 
they do not stand in any logical relations – they are, as I shall put it, normatively insulated 
from one another.” Suppose A claims that in her perspective (or relative to her perspec­
tive), p is true. B claims that in her perspective, which is incommensurable to A’s perspec­
tive, p is false. Usually, if we hold absolutism, we would conclude that either A’s or B’s 
assertion is false, since of two contrary assertions, at most one can be true. But this would 
place the two statements in a logical relation. Now, according to the thesis of relativism, 
there is no cross-perspective standard by which the truth claims of incommensurable state­
ments can be compared. Truth is always relative to a perspective, and claims can only be 
judged, verified, and criticized within that perspective. There are no trans-perspectival 
logical relations.
I will illustrate this with an example from Baghramian and Coliva (2020, p.  71): 
Suppose we want to determine how many sheep are in an enclosure. Mary counts 28 
sheep, Jane comes up with 30 sheep. We are inclined to believe that at least one of them 
has counted incorrectly and that the true number can be determined objectively. But sup­
pose Mary and Jane belong to different cultures and traditions, each with a different math­
ematics and a different way of counting. According to the incommensurability thesis, both 
are right relative to their own views. Rovane (2016, p. 266) calls this a “metaphysically 
irresolvable disagreement.” There is an “epistemic barrier” between these incommensu­
rable perspectives: “the truths on the other side of it would not be truths-for-me even 
though they would be truths-for-others” (Rovane 2016, p. 269). Rovane concludes that 
people who believe in different truths live in different worlds and names her philosophy 
“multimundialism,” which is a kind of “many-worlds theory.” But if Mary and Jane live in 
different worlds, one must ask whether they actually see the same enclosure and count the 
2.2  Relativism and Incommensurability

48
same sheep. Mary and Jane would then be epistemically and ontologically isolated, each 
dreaming and counting sheep in their own solipsistic world.
If one takes relativism seriously, according to which everything is perspective-relative, 
then it follows that the incommensurability thesis cannot claim absolute validity. It is a 
thesis by relativists for relativists, which need not be accepted by non-relativists. Relativists 
cannot expect to convince their philosophical opponents with it. Even rules of discourse 
and principles of argumentation apply only to members of a social community who share 
an epistemic perspective. What a relativist regards as a valid argument, an anti-relativist 
need not accept. The relativist thus remains trapped in her own epistemic perspective, from 
which she cannot break out.
It seems to me that relativists are not aware of the consequences of their own theory. For 
how should inhabitants of different worlds be able to communicate with each other if they 
don’t share a common conceptual system nor a common logic? For them, it wouldn’t be 
consistent to criticize anyone who held a different opinion. Trump supporters could no 
longer argue with Democrats because they each believe in different truths. For Trump vot­
ers, Trump won the 2020 presidential election, while for Democrats, Biden won the elec­
tion, and so both groups live in their own reality. A sincere relativist will remain in his 
epistemic niche and tolerate other people’s opinions, especially those of non-relativists, 
without trying to persuade them or change their minds, “instead he may simply be present­
ing his position in a logically ordered manner” (Meiland 1980, p. 125), where we have to 
add that the relativist has his own logic. The crucial question is whether anyone listens to 
him in his soliloquy and takes him seriously.
Martin Kusch defends a social relativism. In his opinion, the social community is the 
supreme authority and judge of questions of truth and determines whether someone applies 
the truth concept correctly: “The accepted beliefs of a community cannot be false if by 
‘being false’ we mean something like ‘false independently of what anyone says or thinks’.” 
(Kusch 2002, p. 249) Consequently, the community cannot be wrong. What it believes to 
be true is true. This gives the group a right to claim infallibility, which has the consequence 
that individuals can err, while the community is infallible. Social relativism elevates the 
collective over the individual and thereby degrades the individual. When Kusch says that 
knowledge is always a collective truth, this means for the individual: you know nothing, 
therefore trust the community! The judgment of the community can at best be criticized 
from an external perspective. Another group B can conclude that the judgment of group A 
is wrong (Kusch 2002, pp. 250, 259). But this judgment, too, is only valid relative to the 
social judgment perspective and has validity only within group B. There is no neutral 
judge who is able to decide between the competing truth claims. As a result there are as 
many truths as there are groups that establish a regime of truth through their discursive 
practices. These groups will engage in an endless ideological power struggle over who is 
right and who can claim interpretive sovereignty over truth issues.
The Finnish philosopher Antti Hautamäki (2020, p. 172) defends relativism against the 
accusation that it favors or supports post-factual politics: “There are no causal links from 
epistemological relativism to the maxims of the post-truth era.” He is convinced that 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

49
relativism does take truth very seriously: “Truth is taken seriously in relativism.” And he 
asserts that a relativist also respects the truth imperative: “tell the truth, look for evidence 
for all you believe and say” (ibid., p. 173). But what truth is meant by this?
According to relativism, there is no absolute answer about whether a belief is true because 
truth-value is relative to points of view. But every statement has a definite truth-value in each 
point of view. Therefore, to evaluate the truth of a statement, one has to identify a point of 
view behind it. (Hautamäki 2020, p. 172)
What truth a relativist is committed to depends on his or her epistemic perspective. 
“Always tell the truth” means for a relativist: “I always tell my truth, no matter what other 
people think is true”. That means: even Donald Trump is allowed to tweet his truth out to 
the world. A relativist can’t actually object to that. Relativism thus provides a philosophi­
cal justification and legitimation for post-factual politics.
2.3	
Cultural Relativism
Nearly at the same time as Kuhn and Feyerabend presented their incommensurability the­
sis, Peter Winch (1964) developed his concept of cultural relativism, which radically ques­
tions the superiority of scientific rationality. According to this approach, each culture has 
its own understanding of rationality that is not comparable to that of other cultures. As an 
example of an alien concept of rationality Winch mentions the belief in witches and the 
magical rituals of the Azande, a people living in Central Africa. Scientifically educated 
people regard witchcraft beliefs and demon oracles as irrational and culturally inferior. We 
do not believe that diseases can be cured by magical rituals and exorcising demons because 
we are used to think in terms of scientific cause-and-effect relationships. A demon incanta­
tion cannot be the cause of a miraculous healing because we cannot detect a causal relation 
between an incantation and physiological processes. We also do not believe that rain 
dances can bring about rain. Spirits and demons have no place in our material world. Our 
scientific standard is the empirical testability of hypotheses, and testable is for us only 
what is observable, measurable, and quantifiable. The fact that ghosts and demons do not 
exist is for Peter Winch not an argument against the Azande’s worldview because, as Sapir 
and Whorf have shown, our conception of reality is determined by culture and language. 
The Azande have a different language and culture, and therefore a different conception of 
reality.
According to Winch, we have no right to criticize the alleged irrationality of Azande 
beliefs, because a critique of the Azande’s conception of rationality presupposes a deeper 
understanding of the alien culture of this people. We could only understand a culture if we 
shared its way of life: “the concepts used by primitive peoples can only be interpreted in 
the context of the way of life of those peoples” (Winch 1964, p. 315). Therefore, from our 
Eurocentric point of view, we should not condemn the rituals of the Azande as irrational: 
2.3  Cultural Relativism

50
“Something can appear rational to someone only in terms of his understanding of what is 
and is not rational. If our concept of rationality is a different one from his, then it makes 
no sense to say anything either does or does not appear rational to him in our sense.” 
(Winch 1964, p. 316)
Rationality, just like moral concepts, is bound to an evaluative perspective. The magical 
rituals of the Azande may seem irrational to us, but to the Azande they are habitual. We 
must not apply our standards of value to foreign cultures, but judge them from their point 
of view. We would have to engage with other ways of life and open our understanding to 
other points of view and rationalities: “Since it is we who want to understand the Zande 
category, it appears that the onus is on us to extend our understanding so as to make room 
for the Zande category, rather than to insist on seeing it in terms of our own ready-made 
distinction between science and non-science.” (Winch 1964, p. 319)
Against cultural relativism is often raised the objection of self-contradiction. This argu­
ment was first developed by the ancient skeptics. The Pyrrhonian skeptic counters every 
dogmatic assertion that claims absolute truth in denying its validity by setting up counter-­
arguments or demonstrating the relativity of the standpoint. But the skeptic, too, makes an 
assertion, which he believes to be true. If one claims that everything is relative and doubt­
ful, that includes one’s own claim. For the relativist judges from a perspectival view. Thus 
perspectivism weakens its own position. Sextus Empiricus answers to the question whether 
he holds a dogmatic doctrine with the following remark:
If you say that a school involves adherence to a number of beliefs which coher both with one 
another and with what is apparent, and if you say that belief is assent to something unclear, 
then we shall say that Sceptics do not belong to any school. (Sextus 2000, p. 7)
The Pyrrhonian skeptic teaches abstention from judgment (epoché). Only if one consis­
tently abstains from an opinion can one attain tranquility. For he who strives for knowl­
edge and pursues knowledge lives in permanent restlessness. Only when one abandons 
every doctrinal opinion can one attain inner peace. But does not skepticism itself represent 
a doctrine? The skeptics understand their doctrine as a practice and attitude to life. 
Skepticism and doubt are a kind of therapy for purifying the soul from any kind of 
dogmatism.
Unfortunately, the cultural relativists have not followed this abstention from judgment. 
Whoever claims that there are no universally valid norms is himself making a claim with 
universal validity. If, on the other hand, it is only an assertion with limited validity, which 
need not be shared by others, then the relativist cannot assume norms that apply to all 
cultures or that could prescribe how we should behave towards representatives of other 
cultures. Cultural relativists speak of the right to cultural self-determination and the duty 
to preserve cultural heritage, thus postulating universal values that, according to cultural 
relativism, cannot exist (Rippe 1993, p. 61 f.). On the one hand the relativity and cultural 
boundedness of all norms and values is asserted and on the other hand the tolerance 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

51
towards other cultures is raised to a universal, transcultural demand. That does not fit 
together.
In order to compare the values and rationality conceptions of other cultures, a cross-­
cultural perspective is required, which in turn contradicts the principles of cultural relativ­
ism. Presumably, the concept of rationality or a concept comparable to our occidental 
understanding of rationality does not occur in the language of the Azande. The assertion 
that the Azande possess a different conception of rationality than we do is based on pure 
speculation or the wishful thinking of some anthropologists. It therefore makes no sense 
to classify the magical practices of the Azande as rational or irrational. Nicholas Rescher 
(2006, p. 6 f.) expresses this very aptly when he writes:
If their conception is not close to a conception of what we call rationality, then it is just not a 
conception of rationality – it does not address the topic that we are discussing when we put 
the theme of rationality on the agenda. (…) So it is literally nonsense to say ‘The X’s have a 
different conception of rationality from the one we have’. For, if they do not have ours, they 
do not have any.
Peter Winch describes the magical rituals of the Azande very sensitively and sympatheti­
cally. He speaks of the “Zande category of magic”. But again, “magic”, like “rationality”, 
is a term of our language, it is therefore in fact our categories that Winch unjustifiably 
transfers to the Azande culture. Here again the main problem of cultural relativism 
becomes visible: on the one hand, relativism claims that the representatives of alien cul­
tures think in different conceptual schemes that have nothing in common with our concep­
tual categories. On the other hand, the reports of ethnologists and anthropologists suggest 
a deep understanding of other cultures, as if they can see the world through the eyes of the 
Azande. Cultural relativism cannot avoid this dilemma: Either cultural views are indeed 
incommensurable and incomparable, in which case we cannot understand other cultures 
even approximately. Or there are commonalities and cultural universals after all, in which 
case cultural relativism in the strong sense Winch advocates cannot be correct. Even if the 
Azande perceive the world differently and describe it in different terms than we do, we all 
live in the same world and share common hopes, desires, and values.
The cultural relativist views the world from an “eagle perspective” because she wants 
to overcome the ethnocentric “frog perspective” and believes that she can competently 
judge the significance of alien cultures from her universal standpoint (Stagl 1992, 
p.  150  ff.). But this ethnological eagle perspective is not unbiased and value-neutral. 
Although the relativist assigns all cultures equal value, she criticizes the arrogance of 
Western culture and rejects “Eurocentrism” as a “postcolonial” way of thinking.
The “Statement on Human Rights” (1947, p.  543) published by the American 
Anthropological Association states: “man is free only when he lives as his society defines 
freedom”. That means, freedom is defined by society, ultimately by the government of the 
country in question. In North Korea and in China, freedom will be understood differently 
than in the United States. For a regime critic languishing in a North Korean prison, such a 
2.3  Cultural Relativism

52
view may sound cynical and like sheer mockery. Slavery would therefore also be simply 
an expression of a different understanding of freedom. However, it would be absurd if we 
had to tolerate all cultural practices, no matter how cruel. Michael Ignatieff rejects the 
cultural relativists’ criticism of the supposedly Western-oriented human rights discourse 
by saying: “Relativism is the invariable alibi of tyranny.” (Ignatieff 2001, p. 74). It is 
shameful that the right of cultural self-determination is repeatedly claimed by dictators to 
excuse the brutal repression of opposition members.
The modern conception of human rights was developed in Europe at the time of the 
Enlightenment and is thus of Eurocentric origin. But genesis must not be confused with 
justification. The fact of their historical and political-regional origin must not lead to the 
conclusion that they are only valid for European culture. Human rights are a means of 
combating tyranny and oppression. They were born out of the desire to live in dignity. This 
desire is shared by all people in the world.
If – as claimed – people can only be happy in their own culture, then migration would 
be harmful to cultural identity in the long run. Cultural relativism is therefore the opposite 
of cosmopolitanism. Instead of overcoming cultural boundaries, intellectual walls are 
erected between cultures. Indigenous people who leave their homelands would no longer 
be “authentic”. Justin Stagl (1992, p. 152) compares the world of the cultural relativist to 
an ethnological zoo where the “natives” are locked up and the “keepers” make sure that 
they don’t break out of their prison.
In the age of globalization, individual cultures no longer live in isolation, but are con­
nected through communication, trade relations, and mobility. Globalization leads to an 
intercultural understanding. The task of cultural studies should therefore be to recognize 
not only the particularities but also the commonalities of cultures. For Hans Küng (1992, 
p. 49) the world community needs a basic ethical consensus, because only in this way 
conflicts can be settled, wars prevented and global justice realized. In his project “Global 
Ethic” he identifies “maxims of elementary humanity” which are valid in all great world 
religions and to which the five commandments belong: do not kill, do not steal, do not 
commit adultery as well as respect parents and love children (Küng 1992, p. 82). Michael 
Walzer recommends a moral minimalism that emerges as the lowest common denominator 
from the diversity of cultures. The core morality contains first of all negative obligations 
such as the prohibition of murder, torture, oppression, and tyranny (Walzer 1994, p. 10). 
The minimal morality is an expression of a world-wide solidarity, which expresses our 
compassion for the disadvantaged and oppressed of this world. Torture, tyranny, and polit­
ical oppression cannot be excused as expressions of a different moral code or cultural 
peculiarity. Without this minimum standard, humanity would disintegrate into a multitude 
of cultures that separate from each other.
Cultural relativism assumes that human beings are shaped by society and culture. Their 
values are seen as products of socialization and environment. According to this model, 
culture and society determine what is true, good and right. This means as a consequence 
that our categories of thinking are socially conditioned or socially constructed. There is no 
doubt that our perception and thinking are influenced by unconscious assumptions, ideas, 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

53
and concepts. But is everything just a social construction? This is what we want to exam­
ine in the next chapter.
2.4	
Social Constructivism
Traditional epistemology assumes that the world is independent of our thinking and that 
we can gain an objective view of the world. According to this theory, our knowledge is a 
more or less realistic representation of the world. In contrast to such “representationalist” 
theories, various constructivist theories of knowledge were developed in the twentieth 
century, which postulate that our image of the world is not a representation of reality, but 
a construct of our mind or society. As a consequence, the world and the facts are made.
There are different forms of constructivism: social constructivism, radical constructiv­
ism, media constructivism and scientific constructivism, which is represented by David 
Bloor and Barry Barnes in the “Edinburgh Strong Programme” and has been further devel­
oped into laboratory constructivism by Latour, Woolgar and Knorr-Cetina. All these con­
structivist theories reject factualism, i.e. the existence of objective facts, and differ only in 
explaining how our view of the world is constructed. In radical constructivism, the world 
of experience is cognitively constructed by our brains; in social constructivism, it is a 
social, discursive construction; and in media constructivism, it is a media construction. 
Scientific constructivism and laboratory constructivism can be considered as special forms 
of social constructivism because in this case it is the scientific community that produces 
knowledge as a collective. We will deal with scientific constructivism separately in the 
next chapter. In this chapter, the focus will be on social constructivism because it is cur­
rently the dominant paradigm in the social sciences.
Usually we assume that facts are found or discovered. In contrast to that, for social 
constructivism there are no “raw facts”. Rather, facts are the result of how we interpret the 
world. And the interpretation therefore depends on the social and cultural context in which 
we live. This is explained as follows:
Social constructionism denies that our knowledge is a direct perception of reality. Instead, as 
a culture or society we construct our own versions of reality between us. Since we have to 
accept the historical and cultural relativism of all forms of knowledge, it follows that the 
notion of ‘truth’ becomes problematic. Within social constructivism there can be no such 
thing as an objective fact. All knowledge is derived from looking at the world from some 
perspective or other, and is in the service of some interests rather than others. (Burr 2015, p. 9)
In constructivism, a state of affairs becomes a fact only when it is recognized as a fact by 
people. The process of recognition is a social process in which social conventions, inter­
ests and prejudices play a role. Cognition is thus the result of a social activity. Social 
constructivism therefore advocates anti-individualism. For Ludwik Fleck (1979), it is not 
an individual but a thought collective that is the bearer of knowledge. He defines a thought 
2.4  Social Constructivism

54
collective as a “community of persons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intel­
lectual interaction” (Fleck 1979, p. 39).
Social constructivism is very much influenced by Wittgenstein’s contextual theory of 
meaning, which he explained in his Philosophical Investigations (PI). According to 
Wittgenstein, the meaning of a word is determined by its use and the linguistic context. He 
calls the pragmatic context in which a language is embedded a language game. 
Communicative action is like a game defined by social rules. The meaning of a word is not 
the object or state of affairs it denotes. Words do not refer to a world outside language; 
rather, language is a referentially closed construct.
We classify things by applying conceptual categories, whereby – according to the con­
structivist view  – these categories are socially shaped. Sally Haslanger (2000, p.  34) 
explains the process of social construction with the example of gender and race: “On this 
approach, the world by itself can’t tell us what gender is, or what race is: it is up to us to 
decide what in the world, if anything, they are.” Through our socialization we adopt con­
cepts and categories, but also values and prejudices. If an individual lives in a group that 
attributes the property P to an object X, then the individual will believe, or tend to believe, 
that X does indeed have the property P. Through such attributions and ascriptions, property 
P is discursively constructed (Haslanger 1995, p. 99). By exposing the mechanisms of 
social construction, constructivism is able to unmask prejudices and show that supposedly 
“natural” facts are value-laden. This debunking project also pursues a political goal: it 
wants to reveal hidden power structures, condemn discrimination and fight for more social 
justice.
Social constructivism can be characterized by the keywords contingency and conven­
tion. If something is socially constructed, it is contingent and based on a social convention. 
Contingency means: it is not inherently so, but could be otherwise. Ian Hacking explains 
the concept of social construction as follows: X is socially constructed if it holds that “X 
need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not deter­
mined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable.” (Hacking 1999, p. 6) If Hacking’s defi­
nition is taken seriously, everything would be socially constructed. To take an example: 
Even the existence of the moon is contingent in natural history: it could have been that it 
never came into existence. We could live in a world where there is no moon, or where there 
is a moon other than the one visible in our skies at night. But does it follow that it is 
socially constructed? To be frank, we did not create the moon.
The demonstration of contingency is often accompanied by the disclosure of an implicit 
valuation and the moral demand for a value change: “X is quite bad as it is. We would be 
much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed.” (Hacking, ibid.)
Since the world can only be viewed from a socially situated perspective, constructivism 
is closely connected to perspectivism. There are no true or false constructions. But not all 
constructions or perspectives are equal. This is because some constructions can have the 
effect that some social groups are disadvantaged or discriminated against. Therefore, 
social constructivism recommends to favor those constructions that lead to more social 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

55
justice: “When deciding what social categories are, we should just pick the carving that 
best suits our social and political goals.” (Barnes 2017, p. 2419)
Ian Hacking wants to refute a widespread misunderstanding: According to constructiv­
ism, it is not individual things and material objects that are socially constructed, but ideas, 
categories and classifications. Hacking explains this with three examples: “What is socially 
constructed is not, in the first instance, the individual people, the women refugees. It is the 
classification, woman refugee.” (Hacking 1999, p. 10) Similarly, it is not children watch­
ing television who are socially constructed, but “the idea of the child viewer” (p. 26). And 
in physics, it is not the quarks as objects that are constructed, but the idea or conception of 
quarks (Hacking 1999, p. 68). However, this still does not answer a crucial question: are 
ideas, concepts and their semantic contents arbitrarily constructible or are they subject to 
some constraints? Obviously, it makes a difference whether we are analyzing social or 
natural concepts. Let us consider the examples of women refugees and quarks mentioned 
by Hacking. What intuition we have of women refugees depends on the psychological and 
social attitude of the observer. Hacking calls the term “woman refugee” an interactive kind 
because the meaning we attach to the term depends on how we interact with women refu­
gees (Hacking 1999, p. 104). In contrast to that, quarks are natural kinds. Their physical 
properties do not depend on how we interact with them. Admittedly, definitions, units of 
measurement, and methods of measurement can be freely chosen and are therefore con­
ventional. But once we agree upon a method of measurement, units of measurement, and 
a framework of theory, the masses, electric charges, and other properties of quarks are 
unalterably fixed. John Searle (1995, p. 9) calls these properties intrinsic to nature. Intrinsic 
properties are not socially constructed. Women refugees have, besides socially constructed 
properties, also natural intrinsic properties. If social constructivism is to be taken seriously 
as a theory, it must be able to explain the difference between natural and socially con­
structed properties and make a clear distinction between nature and culture.
In the 1920s, Wilhelm Jerusalem (1982, p. 29 ff.) put forward the thesis that Kant’s 
categories are socially constructed. But what would remain of the world if one subtracted 
all constructed categories from our description of the world? People without properties? 
Things without properties? Sally Haslanger warns us not to make the mistake of seeing the 
whole world as a social construction:
But once we come to the claim that everything is socially constructed, it appears a short step 
to the conclusion that there is no reality independent of our practices or of our language and 
that “truth” and “reality” are only fictions employed by the dominant to mask their power. 
(Haslanger 1995, p. 96)

Constructivism has often been accused of supporting anti-realism and casting doubt on 
the existence of a subject-independent reality. Constructivists made it easy for their critics 
because they often used imprecise formulations and did not correctly distinguish between 
reality that is independent of us and our (socially constructed) conception of reality. For 
example, Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann (1991, p. 13) write “that reality is socially 
constructed.” Siegfried Weischenberg and Armin Scholl (1995, p. 220) affirm that: “Reality 
is socially constructed.” Siegfried J. Schmidt defines media constructivism as the thesis: 
“Media do not provide an objective image of reality; rather, they are used to construct 
realities.” (Schmidt 1994, p. 268 f.) And Kenneth J. Gergen (2015, p. 5) draws the bold 
conclusion: “if everything we consider real is socially constructed, then nothing is real 
unless people agree that it is”. Immediately afterwards, Gergen weakens his own thesis by 
adding appeasingly: “Social constructionists do not say, ‘There is nothing’, or ‘There is no 
reality’. The important point is that whenever people define reality (…) they are speaking 
from a particular standpoint.” (Gergen 2015, ibid.) We can conclude from this that reality 
can only be viewed from a particular epistemic perspective or social standpoint and that 
we cannot conceive what reality is in itself. The crucial question is: Does there exist a 
mind-independent reality independent of our particular subjective point of view? If one 
says that reality is constructed, one might think that we can make reality as we like. But 
we can’t turn water into wine, and we can’t just wish away things we don’t like. So what 
is constructed is not the world itself, but our interpretation of the world: that is, what we 
mean when we speak of “reality”.
Nietzsche already realized that there are many different interpretations of reality. Like 
Nietzsche, Gergen also advocates a pluralism of perspectives. But not all perspectives are 
equal; some constructions are more useful than others: “Constructions gain their 
significance from their social utility. (…) All descriptions are not equal; some seem

57
accurate and informative while others are fanciful or absurd.” (Gergen 2015, p. 10 f.) But 
what does useful mean? Ultimately, each interest group decides for itself which construc­
tions are useful for them. Elizabeth Barnes presents a criterion for this: We should choose 
those constructions that best serve our social and political interests (Barnes 2017, p. 2419). 
For Nietzsche, it is always power interests that determine which perspective is taken. Max 
Scheler takes up Nietzsche’s theory of power and applies it to the sociology of knowledge:
Neither the so-called pure reason (rationalism and Kant) nor – as the empiricists thought – 
sensual experience (…) is the ultimate basis for the conviction of the existence of spatio-­
temporal laws of nature which guide all scientific research, but the biological (and not the 
rational or “spiritual”) drive to dominion and power, which itself determines both the intel­
lectual behaviour towards the world in perception, imagination and thinking, and the practical 
behaviour of acting in the world and in moving things in our environment. (Scheler 1982, 
p. 71 f.)
Constructivism retreats to the position that words have no referential meaning, but merely 
play a role in a language game. The meaning of “reality” is discursively constructed and 
context-dependent. Therefore, there can be no “reality” (singular), but only “realities” 
(plural). Lincoln and Guba (2013, p, 39) believe that the existence of objects is merely a 
matter of definition and convention: “they exist only in the minds of the persons contem­
plating them. They do not ‘really’ exist. That is, they have ontological status only insofar 
as some group of persons (…) grants them that status.” Truth is also socially constructed: 
“Truth is a quality of a construct or construction.” (Lincoln and Guba 2013, p. 51) The 
concept of truth is thus deprived of any reference to reality. A statement is true if it is 
accepted as true. Ultimately, this amounts to a consensus theory of truth: “If the social 
consensus is that X is real, it is; if the consensus is that X is not real, it is not.” (Walsh 2013, 
p. 21) What is true or false is therefore not decided by good arguments or empirical evi­
dence, but solely by the majority opinion and thus ultimately by power relations. Such a 
view of truth leads to post-factualism.
According to constructivism, the world cannot be viewed from a neutral objective 
standpoint outside the world. All knowledge is bound to a standpoint and cannot be 
detached from a social perspective. Viewpoints are always subjective, value-laden and 
interest-driven (Harding 2003, p. 302). Scientists also occupy an epistemic standpoint and 
have interests. For Sandra Harding, there can be no value-free science. Lorraine Code 
demands that epistemology must distance itself from the myth of objectivity and take 
subjective points of view into account: “I maintain that a constructivist reorientation 
requires epistemologists to take subjective factors – factors that pertain to the circum­
stances of the subject, S – centrally into account in evaluative and justificatory proce­
dures.” (Code 2008, p.  722) Francis Fukuyama (2018) criticizes this subjectivization 
because it would contribute to an emotionalization of politics: with the commitment to 
subjectivity, feelings would be placed above rational deliberation and thus prioritize the 
view of one’s own group against other views: “The focus on lived experience by identity 
groups prioritizes the emotional world of the inner self over the rational examination of 
2.4  Social Constructivism

58
issues in the outside world and privileges sincerely held opinions over a process of rea­
soned deliberation that may force one to abandon prior opinions.” (Fukuyama 2018, 
p. 101).
If one cannot detach oneself from this situated perspective, the question arises as to 
how sociologists can abstract from their own or their group’s perspective and arrive at an 
objective view. Sharon Crasnow emphasizes that the goal of a feminist standpoint theory 
is to change existing power relations: “Feminist standpoint theory highlights the collective 
and, hence, political interests of women, and so those features of the social world that 
contribute to maintaining the power relations that keep women in subordinate positions 
are relevant given the goal of transforming those power relations.” (Crasnow 2014, p. 156) 
Sandra Harding calls for a new politics, a rejection of the dominant point of view and a 
partisanship for the socially disadvantaged (Harding 2015, p. 34 f.) The goal is to end 
oppression and create an egalitarian society.
Feminist standpoint theorists like Nancy Hartsock, Sharon Crasnow, and Natalie 
Ashton believe that socially disadvantaged groups are epistemically privileged (Ashton 
2020a, p. 77; 2020b, p. 331; Crasnow 2014, p. 159). Oppressed minorities could reveal the 
“true” social conditions and power structures due to their experience. The epistemic privi­
lege thesis has its roots in Marxist epistemology, according to which only the proletariat is 
capable of recognizing the social reality and bringing about change, while the bourgeoisie 
has a false consciousness (Ashton and McKenna 2020, p. 32). What Marx and Engels call 
class consciousness, is in standpoint theory the identity consciousness of the social group 
that determines its thoughts and actions.
It is undoubtedly true that the epistemic perspective of the dominant group is also 
socially dominant and that minorities cannot gain attention against the hegemony of the 
majority. But why should the perspective “from below” be superior to the perspective 
“from above” or be epistemically of advantage? One has to wonder why so many women 
and people of color in the US voted for Donald Trump when, according to Ashton, they 
should be politically enlightened as socially disadvantaged groups. Either their sense of 
identity does not give them an epistemic advantage, or their views depend on other factors 
than their social position.
Susan Hekman (1997, p. 349) states that women have different points of view and 
therefore there are also several truths and multiple realities and none of these points of 
view is privileged. The viewpoint of a disadvantaged minority is just one discursively 
constructed perspective among many others and cannot claim to have access to the reality 
‘in itself’. Epistemic privilege is an evaluative term that presupposes a perspective-­
independent standard of value.
How is the thesis of epistemic privilege justified? According to Ashton, there can be no 
justification independent of perspective, since every justification is itself tied to a socially 
situated perspective. Ashton explains this justificatory relativism as follows: “Justification 
depends on “socially situated” perspectives.” (Ashton 2020b, p. 330) This means, in con­
sequence, that any social group can claim to be epistemically privileged. Even if the thesis 
of epistemic privilege can be justified, it need not be accepted by members of another 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

59
social group, e.g. the socially dominant group, since they have their own standards of 
epistemic justification. Ashton (2019, p. 588) says that “all standpoints are equally cor­
rect”. Paul Boghossian objects to this justificatory relativism that it is circular:
The claim “Nothing is objectively justified, but only justified relative to this or that epistemic 
system” must be nonsense, for it would itself have to be either objectively justified, or only 
justified relative to this or that particular epistemic system. But it can’t be objectively justi­
fied, since in that case it would be false if true. And it can’t be justified only relative to the 
relativist’s epistemic system, since in that case it is just a report of what he finds it agreeable 
to say. If he also invites us to join him, we need not offer any reason for declining since he has 
offered us no reason to accept. (Boghossian 2006, p. 66)
Ashton responds to this objection by supplementing epistemic relativism with additional 
assumptions (Ashton 2019, p. 601 f.):
•	
4
•	 An individual should be able to take on multiple perspectives.
•	 There must be an overlap between the different epistemic perspectives.
But these additional assumptions do not solve the central problem of relativism: for differ­
ent perspectives are based on different criteria of truth and justification. What is true in one 
perspective may be false in another. Suppose there is an overlap between perspectives A 
and B. If a statement p is true in perspective A and false in perspective B, what is the truth 
value of p in the overlap between A and B? If a person is able to take on a different per­
spective, does that also mean that she accepts a proposition of the other perspective as true, 
even if it is false in her own perspective? And last but not least: If the epistemic relativist 
shares the perspective of her critics, does this mean that she also shares the claim of her 
critics that relativism is false?
Ashton (2019, p. 599) constructs a fictional example to illustrate her position: Suppose 
a person claims that some people have less worth because of their skin color or their gen­
der, while you yourself are convinced that all people are equal, i.e., have equal worth. 
Undoubtedly, there are conflicting perspectives here. How can we convince a racist that he 
is wrong? If one assumes, as Ashton (2019, p. 588) does, that all perspectives are equally 
correct and that each perspective has its own standards of justification, then we could not 
criticize the racist. How can a relativist convict Donald Trump of lying if she has to con­
cede that Trump simply has a different view of truth, especially one that may be just as 
correct as her own view? How can you convince climate change deniers of global warming 
when even constructivists believe that climate change is socially constructed (Pettenger 
2007) and that there are no objective facts?
4 Ashton speaks of “epistemic frameworks”. I understand it as a kind of perspective.
2.4  Social Constructivism

60
2.5	
Scientific Constructivism
Social constructivism is a central component of the sociology of knowledge, whose central 
thesis is “that in principle all knowledge (the false and the true consciousness) is socially 
conditioned” (Maasen 1999, p. 13). The founders of the Edinburgh School, David Bloor 
and Barry Barnes, developed a strong constructivism according to which scientific beliefs 
are caused by social factors. The causal thesis states that the sociology of science is causal, 
that is, it is “concerned with the conditions which bring about belief or states of knowl­
edge.” (Bloor 1991, p. 7) The task of the sociology of science, it is argued, is to explain 
why scientists hold certain views and theories and have certain beliefs. It does not matter 
whether these beliefs are true or false: both true and false beliefs must be explainable in 
the same way. Bloor calls this the symmetry thesis (Bloor ibid.).
Barry Barnes postulates a social determinism which claims that scientific beliefs are 
socially determined (Barnes 1974, p. 75). He compares a human being to a machine whose 
actions are determined by its software (Barnes 1974, p. 78 ff.). A person is programmed 
by her socialization, whereby culture and society act like “programmers.” If we knew how 
the program works, we could fully explain people’s beliefs and actions. In this model, the 
social influences represent the input that acts on a scientist, and the output is the result of 
his or her research achievements.
This model of scientific research is in sharp contrast to the traditional rationalist model 
of explanation, according to which scientific hypotheses and theories can be rationally 
explained: A scientist adopts the hypothesis that provides the best explanation for observed 
phenomena, and she chooses the theory that coheres best with empirical data. The tradi­
tional model assumes that scientists can work uninfluenced by society and politics and are 
not guided by interests.
Hans Reichenbach (1961, p. 7) distinguished between a context of discovery and a con­
text of justification. A scientific discovery may be historically contingent: Isaac Newton 
could have discovered his law of gravitation a few years earlier or later. For physics it is 
not relevant who discovered something, to which social class a scientist belongs or in 
which culture he lives. Nor does it matter what mental processes were going on in Newton’s 
mind when he first formulated the law of gravitation. The only thing that matters for a 
physicist is how the law of gravity is justified. Only logical and empirical arguments count 
for a rational justification. The context of discovery may therefore be of interest for the 
history and sociology of science, but it is irrelevant for the scientist who wants to justify a 
hypothesis or a theory.
In the traditional model of science, there is a clear division of tasks between the phi­
losophy of science and the sociology of science: philosophy of science describes how 
research should ideally be conducted, i.e. independently of external social factors, while 
the sociology of science is concerned with the context of discovery and takes the social 
context into account. For the justification of a scientific hypothesis, so the argument goes, 
the social context plays no role.
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

61
Barnes and Bloor reject the distinction between the context of justification and the 
context of discovery. For them, there can be no autonomous research free of social influ­
ences. They refer to the thesis of social constructivism, according to which scientific facts 
are socially constructed. The followers of the Edinburgh School assume that internal epis­
temic reasons are socially determined or based on social conventions. David Bloor con­
tends that he can explain why scientists prefer certain hypotheses and theories: the reasons 
are social causes.
Let us consider an example: the Marxist historian of science Boris Hessen published an 
essay in 1931  in which he examined “The Social and Economic Roots of Newton’s 
Principia” (1974). He shows how the rise of industrial capitalism created the technical 
problems that the new mechanics wanted to solve. The cultural and social environment in 
which Newton worked can indeed contribute much to understand the context of discovery 
of the law of gravitation. But this does not explain why the gravitational force of two 
masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and not 
according to some other law. This can only be explained physically. Social explanations 
can be useful in cases of scientific controversy, where alternative interpretations exist, or 
where scientists have to decide which line of research they want to pursue. Research can 
sometimes indeed be influenced by interests, for example when external values and aims 
become guidelines for scientific research. But there are also disciplines where such exter­
nal social and political influences are negligible, for example in logic, mathematics or 
theoretical physics. Here, too, some research aims may be externally imposed, but in most 
cases the problems are primarily of theoretical nature.
The assumption of a social determination of mental beliefs is a strong thesis with far-­
reaching consequences. For it denies the apparent rationality of science. Applying the 
principle of causality to the sociology of science itself means that its theses are also 
socially determined. Bloor regards the possibility of reflexive self-application as a basic 
principle of the sociology of science: “In principle its patterns of explanation would have 
to be applicable to sociology itself.” (Bloor 1991, p. 7) Let us therefore ask how Bloor 
justifies his theses. Bloor presents a number of reasons and arguments and refers to histori­
cal case studies. But in his own view, all such reasons are merely epiphenomenal. For 
whatever theses he holds and no matter how he justifies his theses: His beliefs were caused 
by social factors. Bloor cannot help but hold these theses because he has been so socialized 
and because he has grown up in an academic milieu in which such theses receive recogni­
tion. This social background may explain why he holds these theses. But it says nothing 
about whether these theses are true or false, convincing or poorly founded. According to 
his symmetry thesis, his theses could even be false or simply irrational and still be accepted 
because we cannot draw any conclusions from the social circumstances to the truth of a 
theory. It would therefore be pointless to appeal to reasons or try to convince. Bloor is 
actually undermining his own scientific claim, namely the claim to hold a well-founded 
theory. Why should we believe Bloor? According to the causal thesis, we would be com­
pelled by causal factors to believe it. But in this respect we are free: We are not forced to 
take his theses seriously.

The choice of an axiom system provides a theoretical framework, within which math­
ematicians conduct research autonomously, following the inner logic of the system, by 
deriving conclusions from the axioms. The choice of the framework may indeed depend 
on social and cultural influences. We can compare the work of a mathematician to a game: 
The rules of the game are given by the axioms, proofs are like moves, and the theorems are 
the resulting configurations of the game. The rules determine how theorems can be derived 
from axioms. At this point Bloor takes up a consideration of Wittgenstein to show that 
rule-following in mathematics is also based on social conventions: “Mathematical neces­
sity is just a species of the moral necessity that frequently attaches to the more important 
social conventions.” (Barnes et al. 1996, p. 183) Wittgenstein describes mathematical rule-­
following with the example of an addition exercise: The exercise is to continue a sequence 
of numbers by repeatedly adding two to the last number. For example, if the number 
20,000 is given, then the sequence 20,002, 20,004, 20,006, … etc. results. Wittgenstein 
presents the following dialogue between a student and a teacher to explain how rule-­
following works in mathematics:
How do I know that in working out the series + 2 I must write “20004, 20006” and not “20004, 
20008”? (The question: “How do I know that this colour is ‘red’?” is similar.)
“But you surely know for example that you must always write the same sequence of num­
bers in the units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, etc.” – Quite true: the problem must already appear in this 
sequence, and even in this one: 2, 2, 2, 2, etc. – For how do I know that I am to write “2” after 
the five hundredth “2”? i.e. that ‘the same figure’ in that place is “2”? And if I know it in 
advance, what use is this knowledge to me later on? I mean: how do I know what to do with 
this earlier knowledge when the step actually has to be taken? (Wittgenstein, RFM, p. 3e)
5 The parallel postulate states that for every line and every point outside the line, there is exactly one 
parallel line through that point that does not intersect the given line.

Bloor concludes: “When we are confronted with a finite set of examples we do not 
extract from them any general idea, rather, we instinctively pass on to what strikes us as 
the next step or the next case. There is no rational basis for this, nor one that can ever be 
formulated in terms of propositions assented to by the rule follower.” (Bloor 1997, p. 13 f.) 
To eliminate ambiguity we have to agree upon a unique interpretation of the rule. In the 
student example, the teacher repeatedly corrects the student when he gets something 
wrong. In science, it is the consensus of the scientific community that determines the 
application of rules (Bloor 1997, p. 16). According to Bloor, rules have a normative char­
acter: the social community is the authority that controls the correct rule-following:
It is necessary to introduce a sociological element into the account to explain normativity. 
Normative standards come from the consensus generated by a number of interacting rule fol­
lowers, and it is maintained by collectively monitoring, controlling and sanctioning their indi­
vidual tendencies. (Bloor 1997, p. 17)
Due to this social control there can be no autonomous science that makes research com­
pletely independent of society. For it is always the social or scientific consensus that 
decides whether standards of correctness are obeyed and whether certain theses and theo­
ries are accepted. But Bloor’s reasoning also has some weaknesses. His interpretation of 
Wittgenstein is highly controversial (cf. Child 2011, p. 142 ff.; Glock 1996, p. 329). When 
Wittgenstein says that following a rule is a practice (PI § 202), he does not explain whether 
he means a social practice or claims that rule-following is only possible in a social com­
munity. Hans-Johann Glock (1996, p. 329) writes: “firstly, there is no plausible rationale 
for restricting rule-following to a community; secondly, the Nachlass explicitly condones 
the possibility of a solitary person like Robinson Crusoe following and inventing rules.” 
But even if we impute to Wittgenstein the view attributed by Bloor, it does not follow that 
6 PI = Philosophical Investigations
2.5  Scientific Constructivism

64
this view is also correct and convincing, because Wittgenstein represents an extreme out­
sider position within philosophy of mathematics which, if we apply Bloor’s central crite­
rion, is not consensually accepted. If consensus is taken as a criterion for correctness, then 
Wittgenstein’s view cannot be correct and cannot be used as a justification for Bloor’s thesis.
Learning by examples may be a good didactic method to teach students correct rule-­
following, but it is not characteristic of how professional mathematicians learn and apply 
rules. In arithmetic, the rules of counting and addition are explained by the Peano axioms. 
The mathematical rules are not introduced by exemples or inductively, but are defined 
deductively. There is no uncertainty about the correct application. The addition of numbers 
is performed purely mechanically as in a computer program without reference to a social 
community. A computer that performs the operation “+ 2” does not have to ask the human 
community whether it is applying the algorithm correctly. There is no ambiguity or con­
tingency in the application of mathematical rules. Logical reasoning follows an internal 
necessity which is given by the axioms. The rules of inference, such as modus ponens, can 
also be introduced axiomatically. The rules of mathematics are therefore fundamentally 
different from the rules of ordinary language. Language rules are not as fixed and rigidly 
defined as the rules of logic. Language games have freedom for individual expression. 
Colloquial language is not a mathematical calculus.
Of course, it is always possible to introduce other rules and, for example, to define an 
arithmetic in which 2 + 2 does not equal 4, but 5, for example. Barnes, Bloor and Henry 
(1996, p. 170 f.) mention the example of a modular arithmetic in which 3 + 3 = 1. Which 
arithmetic and which addition rules one chooses is the result of an agreement or consen­
sus. But within a theoretical framework, once agreed upon, the correct rule-following is 
uniquely defined.

Reality exists in human thought and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can 
make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collec­
tive and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth, is truth. (Orwell 1989, p. 261)
The omnipotent Party thus advocates a kind of social constructivism, according to which 
truth is something that is constructed by the Party. Therefore, anything what the Party says, 
is true, even if it claims that 2 + 2 = 5 (Orwell 1989, p. 262 f.). Unfortunately, Barnes and 
Bloor seem to agree with O’Brien, whereby in their case society takes the role of the Party: 
If other social conventions hold, then 2 + 2 could also add up to 5 (Barnes et al. 1996, 
p. 184). Bloor (1991, p. 5) writes: “knowledge for the sociologist is whatever people take 
to be knowledge. It consists of those beliefs which people confidently hold to and live by.” 
Thus Bloor advocates a radical post-factualism. Evidence does not count. All that matters 
is what people believe. Belief replaces knowledge, and knowledge is nothing else than 
consensual belief.
2.6	
Objectivity in Science
According to the traditional view, research is determined solely by internal epistemic val­
ues and is free from external social influences. The representatives of the Edinburgh 
School sketch a different picture of science. In their view, scientists are driven by external 
goals and interests (Barnes et  al. 1996, p.  120  ff.; cf. Yearley 2005, p.  43  f.). Jürgen 
Habermas also doubts that there is an interest-free knowledge. For the empirical-analytical 
sciences, Habermas (1965) diagnoses a technical exploitation interest that aims at the 
prediction and control of phenomena. In his view, there can be no such thing as an unbi­
ased, impartial, and disinterested subject. Because knowledge and human interests are 
inseparably tied together, also facts and values cannot be separated. This calls the ideal of 
scientific objectivity and rationality into question. Sandra Harding and other feminist phi­
losophers of science doubt that a value-free, subject- and passionless science is possible. 
For them, science as it is currently practiced is sexist and androcentric (Harding 2015, 
p. 26 f.).
Objectivity is often equated with an aperspectival view, a “god’s eye view” (Putnam 
1981) or a “view from nowhere” (Nagel 1986). Since human cognition is always perspec­
tival, there cannot be a god’s eye point of view, but “only the various points of view of 
actual persons reflecting various interests and purposes that their descriptions and theories 
subserve” (Putnam 1981, p. 50). This perspectivity is characteristic not only of our percep­
tion but also of our thinking, judgments, and values: A person’s judgments are biased, 
prone to error, and sometimes based on fallacies. The goal of science is to overcome the 
subjectivity and perspectivity of cognition and to replace the different individual 
2.6  Objectivity in Science

66
viewpoints by a unified objective view, which Thomas Nagel calls the “view from 
nowhere”. The view from nowhere is a perspective-less and holistic view that is not bound 
to a thinking subject, not spoiled by prejudices, and not limited by cognitive boundaries. 
It is a seeing without eyes, a thinking without brain, but nevertheless a cognition of reality.
While human subjects only see how the world appears to them, objective knowledge 
wants to reveal the world as it is in itself, that is, independent of our cognition. We believe 
to arrive at objective knowledge by purifying our judgments of all subjective ingredients, 
and in this way objectifying them. But how can we know which components of a judgment 
are of subjective and which are of objective origin? Does not the ability to make such a 
distinction already presuppose an objective standpoint which finally has to be attained?
Knowledge is never independent of human subjects. Everything that is known is known 
by a subject. Schopenhauer emphasizes this inescapable subject-dependence of human 
cognition when he says: “Thus, no truth is more certain, no truth is more independent of 
all others and no truth is less in need of proof than this one: that everything there is for 
cognition (i.e. the whole world) is only an object in relation to a subject, an intuition of a 
beholder, is, in a word, representation.” (Schopenhauer 2010, p. 23 f.) Statements about 
objective facts are based on judgments made by human subjects. Every judgment is neces­
sarily subjective, hypothetical, and fallible. Subjective sources of error can never be com­
pletely eliminated. But we can learn from errors and at least come closer to objective 
knowledge. The success of science shows that our hypotheses and theories are not 
entirely wrong.
Objectivity is not an all-or-nothing concept. Rather, there is a continuum between the 
subjective and the objective (Nagel 1991, p. 206). Thomas Nagel says that objectivity is a 
goal that we can get closer to, but never reach. Even if there is no such thing as a perspective-­
less view, we should not abandon the pursuit of objectivity in the sense of a regulative idea. 
The goal of science is to provide a description of the world which has to be as realistic as 
possible.
In the debate about the possibilities and limits of scientific objectivity, different con­
cepts of objectivity are used, which must be carefully distinguished. Objectivity is often 
associated with truth: a statement is objective if it is true independently of us (Brown 2001, 
p. 101). Or it is said that a thing exists objectively if it exists independently of us. Elisabeth 
Lloyd (1995) speaks of ontological objectivity when a statement is made about reality as 
opposed to mere opinion. Ontological objectivity assumes realism and postulates that 
there are things that exist independently of us and that we come to know reality at least 
approximately. Lloyd doubts that this is possible. Ontological objectivity, she argues, 
starts with a false premise. Lloyd speaks of an “ontological tyranny” and justifies this by 
saying that we cannot detach ourselves from our subjective views and interests. But I think 
Lloyd goes too far with her critique of the ideal of objectivity. For if we abandon a connec­
tion between scientific knowledge and reality and deny the possibility of objective knowl­
edge, then we become victims of post-factual thinking. Joseph Hanna (2004, p.  340) 
accuses Lloyd of being biased in her judgments:

How can one coherently reject the claim that science is “aimed at” an independently existing, 
objective reality, while maintaining that scientific methods can (and ought to) be neutral, non-­
ideological, and unbiased? If we cannot make sense of the notion of an external reality that is 
independent of our expectations, interests, and intentions, then how can we maintain that 
scientists ought to follow a method of investigation that is neutral and disinterested?
The possibility of objective knowledge is based on the assumption that the objects of 
research are real, that means that electrons, planets, or black holes, for example, exist. 
What Lloyd calls ontological objectivity, Hanna (2004, p. 343) calls external objectivity: 
“external objectivity amounts to independence from subjective or inter-subjective factors 
or influences”. External objectivity determines what is a correct description of the world. 
To represent a fact objectively means to represent it truthfully, i.e. as close to reality as 
possible. If there were no external or ontological objectivity, we would have no access to 
reality. Science would be detached from the real world and everything would be mere 
opinion and conjecture.
According to common usage, objectivity is the opposite of subjectivity. Persons 
engaged in scientific work therefore judge objectively when they are unbiased, impartial, 
and rational. Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison (2007, p. 17) explain this notion of objec­
tivity as follows: “To be objective is to aspire to knowledge that bears no trace of the 
knower – knowledge unmarked by prejudice or skill, fantasy or judgment, wishing or 
striving.” Nevertheless, this pursuit of objectivity is called into question and discredited 
because it allegedly demands “the scientific self to be eliminated” (Daston and Galison 
2007, p. 197). Objectivism is accused of suppressing “some aspect of the self” (Daston, 
Galison 2007, p. 36). This pejorative use of words shows that Daston and Galison them­
selves do not judge without bias and pretend that objectivity is a bad thing. But it may be 
doubted that abandoning the ideal of objectivity and allowing more subjectivity (Code 
2008) will improve science.

Other truths, however, are only subjectively true, such as the sentence “Vanilla ice 
cream tastes better than walnut ice cream.” This sentence may be true for Smith but false

for Jones because they have different taste preferences. The truth of such subjective opin­
ions cannot be verified, since we cannot look inside other people’s minds. Sensation judg­
ments can only be introspectively verified by the person who has those sensations: I know 
my mental states by “looking inside myself.” In a sense, one cannot be deceived in this. 
For what does deception mean in this case? The determination of a deception presupposes 
a comparison of true and false. But judgments of sensation have no basis of intersubjective 
comparison. Wittgenstein writes: “One would like to say: whatever is going to seem cor­
rect to me is correct.” (Wittgenstein, PI § 258)
Subjective opinions can be shared by other people. If several people believe that Smith 
owns a Porsche, then a subjective truth becomes an intersubjective truth. But also inter­
subjective truths need not be objectively true. Smith could deceive his neighbors and pre­
tend that he owns the Porsche. In reality, he just rented it. Intersubjective truths are based 
on consensus and represent the prime example of socially constructed beliefs. The judg­
ment of the community represents a corrective to subjective opinions. Nevertheless, even 
if all people believe that a proposition p is true, that does not mean that p is also objectively 
true. In the past people used to believe that the earth is flat. As we know today, this belief 
is objectively false. The social mechanisms that lead to an intersubjective consolidation of 
a belief despite contrary evidence are typical of echo chambers, because those epistemic 
bubbles gain their stability and strength from mutual support and confirmation.
Intersubjective truths are often overestimated. A common fallacy is the belief that the 
probability of a proposition p to be true increases with the number of people who are con­
vinced that p is true. It is argued with the “wisdom of the crowds” (Surowiecki 2004) and 
the cleverness of the masses. But the alleged “wisdom of the crowds” can also turn out to 
be a populist stupidity. What matters, after all, is not what the majority believes, but 
whether there are good reasons to believe it and whether that belief can be empirically 
confirmed. Truth is not determined by vote or consensus.
What distinguishes an objective truth from a merely intersubjective truth is the way of 
justification. Arguments and evidence must be put forward, people must be convinced and 
not simply persuaded. According to Popper, the scientific approach is characterized by the 
objectivity of its method. Scientific statements are open to criticism, they are based on 
empirical methods, and are intersubjectively verifiable. A clairvoyant may arrive at unbi­
ased and impartial judgments, and what she predicts with her prognostic abilities may be 
correct by chance, but her approach is unscientific and therefore not objective. Risjord 
explains the objectivity of method (2014, p. 23) as follows: “A method is reliable insofar 
as it provides results that are likely to be true. (…) In the reliability sense, objectivity has 
to do with how well we trust our methods to be free from error.” This procedural concep­
tion of objectivity defines objective truths as the outcome of the research process by the 
use of scientific methods (Hammersley 2011, p. 82). Popper therefore characterizes objec­
tivity not by the epistemic virtues of the scientist or by the intersubjective consensus of the 
scientific community, but by its critical tradition: “What may be described as scientific 
objectivity is based solely upon a critical tradition.” (Popper 1976, p. 95)
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

Popper (1976, p. 93 ff.) tells an anecdote to support his view of objectivity: Popper 
joined a scientific conference, where a social anthropologist participated and attentively 
followed the discussions of the other participants. When asked if he could also contribute 
something to the discussion, he replied that he was merely following the debate “from the 
outside and from a more objective point of view”. Indeed, he observed how individual 
speakers tried to dominate the group and thus exercised discursive power. The debate, he 
said, was merely “a group ritual of verbalization.” Popper then asked him if he were to 
believe that there is such a thing as factual reasons or arguments that could be valid or 
invalid. The anthropologist replied that it is a subjective illusion to believe that one can 
distinguish between arguments and other verbalizations, or between objectively valid and 
invalid arguments. What Popper is describing here is the practice of ethnomethodology 
which is popular especially in scientific constructivism: sociologists are not interested in 
truth; they are just researching social phenomena, which belong to the realm of the 
intersubjective.
In the natural sciences, a proposition p is said to be objectively true if the best available 
theories and the best available data imply that p is true. Truth in this sense is merely a 
temporary truth, since with increasing knowledge even generally accepted truths can turn 
out to be false. A similar conception of objectivity can be found in the historical sciences: 
A historical statement is objectively true if it has been evaluated by established research 
methods and if it coheres with all available historical sources (Faber 1975, p. 24).
In the sociology of science and feminist philosophy of science, on the other hand, there 
is a widespread tendency to reduce objectivity to intersubjectivity. This is explained by the 
interactive social character of science (Longino 1990, p.  68). Scientific knowledge is 
regarded as a special kind of social knowledge (Longino 1990, p. 75). In the process of 
scientific discourse, so the story goes, different subjective assessments of empirical data 
and hypotheses would be replaced by a uniform consensual belief, which would improve 
the reliability and objectivity of research results:
From all this it follows again that the greater the number of different points of view included 
in a given community, the more likely it is that its scientific practice will be objective, that is, 
that it will result in descriptions and explanations of natural processes that are more reliable 
in the sense of being less characterized by idiosyncratic subjective preferences of community 
members than would otherwise be the case. (Longino 1990, p. 80)
Thus, truth is what receives intersubjective approval. If truth consisted only in social rec­
ognition, this would lead to relativism and each social group could postulate its own truths. 
A dialogue or an exchange of arguments between these groups would not be possible, 
because intersubjective truth is established by recognition and not by arguments or objec­
tive criteria. Suppose group A acknowledges the truth of proposition X and group B holds 
X to be false. Then there are at least two intersubjective truths, because truth exists only 
within a group. And each group has its own standards of rightness and truth. There are the 
Trump supporters and Trump opponents, the Covid deniers, racists and conspiracy 
2.6  Objectivity in Science

theorists. All these groups interpret the world differently and defend different values. 
When all perspectives are equal, you can no longer criticize someone who holds a different 
opinion than you.
Helen Longino is well aware of this problem and therefore takes up Jürgen Habermas’ 
idea of defining truth not simply as an unqualified consensus, but as a justified discursive 
consensus that emerges as the result of an argumentative debate (Longino 1990, p. 78 f.; 
cf. Habermas 1995, p. 160). Since discourse is a social process, the scientific community 
is the ultimate authority on matters of truth. Discourse theory rejects an ontological con­
ception of objectivity: It is not reality that determines whether an assertion is true, but the 
scientific community. Justification is understood as a dialogical process in which subjec­
tive factors and social values contribute to the result. To justify an assertion means to jus­
tify oneself toward a community. According to this view, justifications are always relative 
to an audience (Rorty 1995, p. 283).
Like Longino, Thomas Kuhn (1977, p. 329) argues that individual factors enter into the 
decision between competing theories, which depend on the biography and personality of 
the scientists. Martin Kusch (2002, p.  148) also does not acknowledge the difference 
between the context of justification and the context of discovery and categorically asserts 
that “justification is a social status”. For him, there is no truth and objectivity independent 
of social institutions (Kusch 2002, p. 258).
Robert Brandom (1994, p. 599) criticizes this identification of objectivity with inter­
subjectivity: “The identification of objectivity with intersubjectivity so understood is 
defective in that it cannot find room for the possibility of error regarding that privileged 
perspective; what the community takes to be correct is correct.” Such a view leads to 
extreme relativism and post-factualism. If one decouples truth from reality and defines it 
as the consensual opinion of a social group, then each group can hold its own truth without 
fear of being refuted by reality. Argument and reasoning may be important for Longino, 
but what must be added to make an assertion true is the agreement of the community. 
Longino’s conception of truth can be called an authoritarian model of truth. For example, 
if Copernicus believes that the earth moves around the sun, then this would be false until 
the scientific community decides to accept the Copernican doctrine. The truthmakers are 
therefore not the facts, but the scientific community.
For Longino (1990, p. 67), science is a social practice in which many individuals work 
together on a project and justify their hypotheses and theories discursively. It seems as if 
individuals alone are not capable of doing science and producing results. But sometimes 
scientific revolutions are initiated by researchers who work and research as lone wolves 
outside the scientific community. To provide an example, consider how Albert Einstein 
developed the special theory of relativity. In 1905, Einstein was a patent examiner at the 
Swiss Federal Patent Office in Bern, working isolated from the scientific community on a 
theory that he published in the same year in the Annalen der Physik under the title “On the 
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” and which was later celebrated as a scientific revolu­
tion. Einstein was not part of a scientific network. He explained his ideas only to his col­
leagues Michele Besso and Joseph Sauter, who were also employed at the Bern Patent 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

71
Office. He didn’t join a scientific discourse, i.e. he didn’t communicate his ideas to other 
scientists. Einstein could have lived on a desert island and worked out his theory of relativ­
ity there. In his article he didn’t mention the important works of Lorentz, Fitzgerald, and 
Poincaré, which paved the way to Einstein’s theory, so it is not clear, how much he owes 
his ideas to the work of others. In contrast to today’s academic customs, Einstein’s publi­
cation didn’t contain a bibliography.
If one takes Longino’s and Kusch’s thesis seriously that justifications have a social 
status and can only be established by a thought collective, then one could not call Einstein 
the founder of the special theory of relativity. The theory would only be objectively valid 
if it gained general recognition. Einstein had to wait many years for this recognition. But 
this view is counterintuitive. An approval does not make a theory true or objectively cor­
rect. Justification is done by argument, not by the assent of other scientists. Laws of nature, 
unlike legal laws, do not have to be approved and signed by an authority.
Longino (1990) and Harding (2015, p. 37) reject the claim of value freedom and value 
neutrality in science. The value freedom thesis is regarded as an obsolete relic of positivist 
philosophy of science. They simultaneously refuse to accept the distinction between the 
context of justification and context of discovery. For Elizabeth Lloyd (1995, p. 352), cog­
nition depends on gender. And Sandra Harding (2015, pp. 27, 34) blames widespread sex­
ism, androcentrism and Eurocentrism for the lack of objectivity in scientific research. In 
her view, there is no separated rational realm of reasoning and a realm of discovery unin­
fluenced by values. For her, knowledge is always guided by interests and dependent on 
power relations.
Another argument against the separation of facts and values is Duhem’s and Quine’s 
underdetermination thesis. The underdetermination thesis states that there may be differ­
ent theories that are equally well compatible with the empirical data and that no experi­
ment can decide between them. Underdetermination opens a possibility space for different 
interpretations, so that in theory choice it is ultimately not empirical data and objective 
arguments that decide which theory should be preferred, but individual factors and subjec­
tive preferences (Kuhn 1977, p. 329; Harding 1995, p. 331 f.). If two theories are equally 
well confirmed empirically, one usually opts for the simpler and more elegant theory. Like 
Sandra Harding, Thomas Kuhn also points out that the decision in favor of a theory is not 
always justified by arguments and evidence alone (Kuhn 1977, p. 320).
2.6  Objectivity in Science

According to Gerhard Schurz (2014, p. 42), science-external values must not play any 
role in the context of justification: “A specific realm of scientific activity, namely their 
context of justification, should be free from fundamental science-external value assump­
tions.” Schurz admits that values do have an influence on the discovery and exploitation 
context, e.g. in the choice of research topics and in the formulation of hypotheses. Which 
goals research should pursue, which research projects should be funded and which techni­
cal applications are intended are indeed subject to political influences and social values. 
Goals and values are set by politics or society. Science can only find out which means are 
suitable to achieve these goals: If a given end E is to be realized and if E can only be real­
ized by means M, then the means M should also be realized (Schurz 2014, p. 39). For 
example: If we want to reduce the number of new infections in the COVID-19 pandemic, 
then we must take appropriate measures such as mandatory masks, distance bans, hygiene 
measures, and contact restrictions. Scientific experts can only make conditional recom­
mendations, but they should not postulate values themselves.
Objectivity is sometimes identified with value freedom (Douglas 2004, p.  459  f.). 
“Objective means detached, disinterested, unbiased, impersonal, invested in no particular 
point of view (or not having a point of view).” (Lloyd 1995, p. 353) Against the fact-value 
dichotomy, the argument is put forward that concepts themselves can be value-laden 
(Risjord 2014, p. 28 f.). Words as such are value-neutral. Values are mental attitudes and 
attitudes of human individuals. They arise from our use of language and how we employ 
words. By using language we can express our feelings and attitudes towards people or 
events. Moral and political terms always have an emotional content. Terms such as free­
dom, racism, poverty, or unemployment are undoubtedly value-laden. Especially in the 
social and historical sciences, the demand for value freedom or value neutrality seems 
impossible to fulfill. A sentence such as “Thousands of people were murdered in 
Auschwitz” is a typical hybrid sentence that combines facts and values. We cannot simply 
take note of such a sentence without emotion. The question of how many people died in 
Auschwitz may be a question of fact. But in which cases it is a matter of murder or 
“merely” a matter of letting people die is a normative question. The accusation of lack of 
objectivity in the Auschwitz example is typically made by Holocaust deniers and relativ­
izers, and is intended to distract from the actual facts. It is certainly possible to distinguish 
facts from normative conventions and evaluations. In the above example one simply has to 
define what “murdered” means. Valuations enter into definitions of terms, it depends, for 
example, on whether one defines a term narrowly or broadly and which things or events 
fall under the term. Once a definition has been chosen, it is always possible to decide 
whether murder has occurred or not.
9 What disastrous consequences it can have when values instead of reasons are allowed to guide 
research show the examples of phrenology (Poskett 2019), Lyssenkoism (deJong-Lambert 2012), 
and race research (Sussman 2014).
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

73
The above sentence can therefore be justified in a value-neutral way by applying the 
legal definition of murder to the Auschwitz case and determining how many people were 
actually murdered in Auschwitz. This shows that the objectivity of scientific justifications 
cannot be disputed by referring to the value-ladenness of statements. If one were to aban­
don the ideal of objectivity, science would become biased. One could interpret facts in 
such a way that they fit into one’s own value system or ignore inconvenient facts alto­
gether. To abandon the claim to objectivity would be to abandon science. The goal of sci­
ence is essentially to gain knowledge that is independent of subjective interests and 
attitudes. You can’t make up the world to suit yourself. To describe facts we don’t need 
values or feelings.
While Helen Longino identifies objectivity with intersubjectivity, Sandra Harding takes 
a different path: she replaces the traditional concept of objectivity with a different concept, 
which she calls “strong objectivity”. For Harding, objectivity in the sense of value free­
dom, impartiality and disinterestedness does not exist. Instead, she urges us to become 
aware of the interests, values, and political influences that prevail in science and to criti­
cally question them. In doing so, she opposes a depoliticization of science – on the con­
trary, scientists should resolutely advocate such values as gender equity, diversity, and 
anti-racism (Harding 1995, p.  335; 2015, p.  35). Harding defends standpoint theory, 
according to which disadvantaged social groups are epistemically privileged because of 
their own experiences: “Standpoint theory claims that starting from women’s lives is a 
way of gaining less false and distorted results of research.” (Harding 1995, p.  346) 
Dominant social groups, she argues, are epistemically corrupted because of their inherent 
sexism and androcentrism. Therefore, Harding supports the values and perspectives of 
marginalized groups and calls for a “science from below” (Harding 2015, p. 46): “In any 
particular research situation, one is to start off research from the lives of those who have 
been disadvantaged by, excluded from the benefits of, the dominant conceptual frame­
works.” (Harding 1995, p. 344)
In a way, such an approach is paradoxical: objectivity is generally understood to be the 
opposite of subjectivity. Science is supposed to be group-blind, i.e. not favouring or disad­
vantaging any social group. Harding, on the other hand, wants to achieve objectivity by 
strengthening subjectivity and prioritizing particular group interests. Lorraine Code (2008, 
p. 726) takes a similar approach and demands that subjective views should be given more 
attention in science: “subjectivity has to be taken into account”.
Noretta Koertge (2000, p. 54) criticizes Harding’s approach and accuses her of an ideo­
logical stance: “There is an irony in the Emancipationist call to place ideological con­
straints on the content of science.” Koertge (2000, p. 54) warns us that the sciences would 
thereby be politically instrumentalized and “lose not only its epistemic authority but also 
its rhetorical and political usefulness.” Thus, she recommends, “We should make every 
attempt to keep politics and religion out of the laboratory.” (Koertge 2000, p. 53)
It is legitimate and quite right that scientists represent values. However, these should be 
democratic and common social values and not group-specific values. What Harding propa­
gates can be called a slave revolt of morality in science. The dominant values of the ruling 
2.6  Objectivity in Science

74
class are to be replaced by the values of the oppressed class. But as Nietzsche already 
recognized, the power relations can also be reversed and the previously marginalized 
minorities can become the new privileged class: “These weaklings – in fact they, too, want 
to be the powerful one day, this is beyond doubt, one day their ‘kingdom’ will come too.” 
(Nietzsche, GM I § 15, KSA 5, p. 283) Power imbalances cannot be eliminated in this 
way – on the contrary: the old power relations are just replaced by new power relations.
Like Harding, Rorty postulates a priority of the ethical over the epistemic and calls for 
solidarity rather than objectivity. In choosing between relativism and ethnocentrism Rorty 
prefers ethnocentrism: “We should say that we must, in practice, privilege our own group, 
even though there can be no noncircular justification for doing so.” (Rorty 1991, p. 29) 
Objectivity for him – as for Longino – is “the desire for as much intersubjective agreement 
as possible” (Rorty 1991, p. 23) and true are those beliefs that we find good to believe 
(ibid., p. 24). Rorty thus provides a philosophical basis for post-factualism: a post-­factualist 
believes only what he or his social group believes to be true. Truth is replaced by belief or 
mere opinion and is determined by group conformity.
2.7	
Objectivity in Journalism
The work of a journalist can be compared to that of a scientist. Journalists are also in 
search of the truth. They want to convey a picture of events as objective as possible, inter­
pret the world and provide knowledge. The empirical basis of journalistic research is given 
by news agency reports, documents, pictures, interviews and eyewitness accounts. In jour­
nalism similar criteria of objectivity apply as they do in science: a journalist should report 
in a neutral, unbiased, impartial and truthful manner. News should be factual and separated 
from commentary and personal opinion. The journalist must be able to verify reports and 
name his or her sources.
These high standards of objectivity have come under attack. The arguments of critique 
are the same as those in the critique of scientific objectivity. Brian Winston and Matthew 
Winston (2021, p. 7) believe that abstention from subjective opinions and influences is 
simply impossible: “the idea of a human being not being subjective is a contradiction in 
terms”. Due to the theory-laden nature of perception, facts cannot simply be perceived, but 
have to be interpreted (Munoz-Torres 2012, p. 572). Moreover, facts and values cannot be 
strictly separated. The very selection of news and the assessment of their importance 
depend on values (Munoz-Torres 2012, p. 573 f.). Media in general describe only a spe­
cific fragment of reality and report from a particular perspective, whereby the selection of 
information and the type of reporting is determined by media gatekeepers. Media con­
structivism rejects the correspondence theory of truth. Siegfried Weischenberg and Armin 
Scholl (1995, p. 220 f.) justify this as follows:
First, journalists do not represent the world in their statements, but construct images of the 
world; they are observers (of second order) who present the results of distinctions they 
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

75
themselves have made. Media are not cameras; neither are photographers. Journalists estab­
lish, on the basis of these distinctions, relationships and thus, in the end, constructions they 
themselves have made. Second, it is ultimately the individual journalist who decides in what 
way what meaning is assigned to which events. This means that journalists cannot hide behind 
the term ‘objectivity’.
This criticism is entirely justified, because journalists often do not have direct access to 
information and depend on reports from other people, e.g. insiders, whistleblowers and 
eyewitnesses, and have to trust the truth of their statements. Especially in war reporting, 
journalists do not have the possibility to compare statements of eyewitnesses with reality 
because being in war zones is very dangerous. In contrast to scientists who have their 
objects of observation directly in front of them in the laboratory, in journalism the infor­
mation is transmitted by messengers. The truth content of a message that reaches the 
recipient depends on the credibility of the source and the trustworthiness of the messenger. 
As a consequence, journalistic truth criteria should include coherence and intersubjective 
agreement. If several independent sources report consistently on a fact, then the probabil­
ity that the report is true is increased.
According to Christopher Meyers (2019, p. 228 ff.), the journalistic claim to objectivity 
is based on a naïve empiricism and does not take the filter function of the media into 
account (cf. Frost 2011, p. 76 ff.). The filters are conceptual schemes according to which 
perception and its interpretation are structured: “These include, among other factors, the 
observers’ history, values, experience, politics, religion, and educational background.” 
(Meyers 2019, p. 229) Media are therefore not passive mirrors of the world that depict 
events realistically; rather, they represent reality in a distorted way. Maras (2013, p. 66) 
and Meyers (2019, p. 234) speak of invisible ideological frames through which news is 
filtered. Events are not simply reported unmediated, but must be interpreted and contextu­
alized by journalists: “all works of journalism are interpretations to some degree” (Ward 
2011b, p. 224). Another argument, which speaks against the ideal of objectivity, is the 
political and social situatedness of the reporter or journalist, which leads to an inevitable 
subjectivity of reporting (Conway 2020, p.  96; Winston and Winston 2021, p.  160). 
Siegfried J. Schmidt (1994, p. 268 f.) therefore concludes: “Media do not provide an 
objective image of reality; rather, they are used to construct realities.”
However, media constructivism can have a counterproductive effect, because most 
media users are realists: they do not want “constructed” realities, rather they expect an 
objective reporting. If media scholars openly admit that media are not objective, this can 
have the effect of disappointment and cause a turn to fake news media that promise their 
users the truth and nothing but the truth.
The journalistic standard of objectivity is sometimes understood as a demand for neu­
trality, according to which journalists should put aside their personal opinions and report 
in a balanced manner. In concrete terms, balance means that if there are two conflicting 
opinions on a politically controversial topic, both sides should have their say, their view 
should be heard, and the final evaluation should be left to the readers. In many cases, this 
2.7  Objectivity in Journalism

76
leads to a noncommittal “he said, she said” journalism (Maras 2013, p. 64), where every­
one is allowed to voice his or her opinion, but no discursive debate takes place. Does this 
mean, for instance, that the worldview of conspiracy theorists is allowed to be placed on 
equal footing and given equal weight against established scientific knowledge? If all per­
spectives are treated equally, this leads to relativism (Durham 1998, p. 124 ff.). Dentith 
(2017, p. 72) therefore fears that a misunderstood balancing opens a gateway for fake 
news: “false balance arguably allows fake news to flourish”.
This criticism is conclusive, because balancing is based on a false understanding of 
objectivity. For if the obligation to journalistic objectivity is understood as the pursuit of 
truth, then true news and fake news cannot be juxtaposed as equal views. A journalist must 
take a clear stand against lies and can’t let Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about the alleg­
edly rigged 2020 presidential election pass without comment. In fact, balancing and truth 
relativism are propagated especially by “alternative journalism” (Atton 2010, p. 172 f.) 
and postmodern media theories that reject the ideal of objectivity. Brian and Matthew 
Winston (2021, p. 11), for example, believe that there are no clear distinctions between 
truth and falsity in journalism; rather, a journalist constantly moves in a grey area between 
factuality and fictionality:
There is, then, no meaningful true/false binary in journalism, and to ground a discussion of 
journalism’s function in such terms is obfuscating. The issue of the ‘truthfulness’ of journal­
ism is less a matter of black or white – honest or mendacious representation – than it is a 
matter of infinite shades of grey.
Against this view it must be objected that, if there are no clear criteria for distinguishing 
truth from falsehood, as Winston claims, then the journalist would be forced to perma­
nently move in a post-factual twilight zone. The rejection of the ideal of truth and objectiv­
ity thus amounts to a “post-truth journalism” (Maras 2013, p. 76), which holds that the 
prevailing ideology determines what is true and real: “What counts as ‘truth’ in a given 
instance is determined by who has the power to define reality.” (Allan 2010, p. 149).
Geoffrey Baym (2010, p. 379) goes even further and defends fake news as a resistance 
against the predominant point of view because it putatively reflects a broader diversity of 
opinion: “the fake news instead challenges the claims offered by those in power”. And he 
praises it as the “way of the future”: “fake news may indeed be ‘the way of the future’” 
(Baym 2010, p. 382).
Objectivity critique is often connected with ideology critique. Ideology theory is based 
on social determinism, according to which being determines consciousness. Social condi­
tions are held responsible for people’s inability to recognize the truth. As a consequence, 
social structures, media and power structures shape our experience and distort our percep­
tion of reality: “In this approach, the news media are understood to reproduce the hege­
monic or dominant ideologies of capitalist society, in the service of powerful commercial 
and state interests.” (Calcutt and Hammond 2011, p. 105) Herbert Marcuse (2002) sus­
pects the mass media of the capitalist world of a manipulation of needs and a new form of

control that forces people to think in a “one-dimensional way”. According to this view, 
there can be no objectivity: “there are only competing perspectives, none of them ‘true’” 
(Calcutt, Hammond, ibid.). Objectivity is regarded as a political construct (Allan 1995, 
p. 135). Furthermore, political discourses and power structures are said to act as ideologi­
cal frames that provide a deformed picture of reality: “frames distort or fail to measure up 
to a reality” (Maras 2013, p. 68). Objectivity norms are generally suspected of ideology, 
since they supposedly disseminate only the view of the dominant group and suppress dis­
senting opinions that are standing outside the social consensus (Raeijmaekers and 
Maeseele 2017, p. 649). In addition to that, Raeijmaekers and Maeseele (2017, p. 652) 
also view social consensus critically. They say: “every consensus is always at least par­
tially the result of ideological domination and exclusion”.
If reality is always socially constructed and ideologically distorted, then the “distortion 
thesis” makes no sense, because then there can be no undistorted reality behind the con­
struction. Ideology critique cannot contribute to an unmasking of reality because it is itself 
also just one perspectival view among others and cannot provide an objective or at least a 
more objective view. False consciousness cannot be overcome by simply overturning the 
dominant perspective and replacing it with another perspective, since “there is no such 
thing as absolute truth” (Raeijmaekers and Maeseele 2017, p. 649).
The distortion thesis defies empirical testing. For it could only be verified by reference 
to social experiences or facts. But these experiences and facts are themselves ideologically 
shaped. Consequently, there is no theory-independent neutral authority that would be able 
to test the ideology thesis. The thesis is therefore self-confirming and cannot be falsified.
Ideology critique remains trapped in a binary true-false thinking despite all criticism of 
the correspondence theory of truth: On the one hand, there is the dominant group that, 
thanks to its hegemonic power in the media, provides a false picture of reality, and on the 
other hand, there are the marginalized and disadvantaged groups that, due to their enlight­
ened social consciousness, debunk the false appearance and thus see the world correctly – 
or at least claim to see the world correctly. Chambers (2017, p.  179) formulates this 
intrinsic inconsistency as a question: “If our thoughts and practices are always shaped by 
ideology, how can we know what is right or wrong, good or bad?” However, the very fact 
that it is possible to expose false media reports shows that it is at least possible to come 
closer to a more objective view.
In order to unmask ethnocentric, racist or sexist prejudices, standpoint journalism gives 
preference to the perspective of discriminated minorities: “In other words, a critical exam­
ination of the journalist and the journalistic institution from the perspective of the most 
marginalized “object” of investigation would be at the core of every news story.” (Durham 
1998, p. 132) Durham suggests that the subjective perspective of marginalized groups 
should be included in reportage. This deliberately violates the requirement of neutrality. 
Journalism becomes partisan, the journalist becomes a social activist and supporter of 
identity politics and class struggle. But who belongs to the marginalized groups? Who 
determines which group can claim that status? (Ryan 2001, p. 15) Does it include, for 
example, Covid deniers or conspiracy theorists?
2.7  Objectivity in Journalism

78
The traditional understanding of objectivity undoubtedly has its weaknesses. But when 
journalists abandon the pursuit of objective reporting and turn truth into an expression of 
subjective convictions or a class point of view, they give way to post-factualism. Truth thus 
becomes a game ball of opposing social groups and a mirror of political power relations. 
If there is a change of power, then the truth also changes. What was true before now 
becomes false and vice versa. Objectivity does not mean being neutral and accepting truth 
and fake news as equally valid opinions. A commitment to truth and objectivity is indis­
pensable to journalistic work. Stephen Ward (2011a, p. 137 f.) writes:
Without clear notions of truth and objectivity, media ethics lacks the resources to distinguish 
between good and bad journalism and lacks the authority to critique dubious practice. If jour­
nalists dismiss truth and objectivity as impossible, or as a cultural myth, they open the doors 
to subjective and misleading journalism. Who can criticize a biased journalist or critique 
subjective reporting if we doubt the ideal of truthful, objective journalism? On what basis do 
we critique journalism if we question the difference between truth and falsity, between sub­
jectivity and objectivity? How can we complain about biased reporting if we no longer expect 
journalists to be objective? If everything is simply one’s perspective, why bother constructing 
stories according to careful methods and demanding criteria?
Ward (2011a, p. 119) warns against a postmodern truth skepticism and recommends a 
pragmatic notion of objectivity that avoids the weaknesses of the traditional notion of 
objectivity, but still adheres to the concept of truth. Ward takes up a moderate position 
between a positivist understanding of objectivity and a social constructivist critique of 
objectivity. In his view, journalists do not depict reality one-to-one, they do not represent 
facts but interpret them. But interpretations cannot be arbitrary, they must be truth-­
adequate: “Interpretations must in some way agree with the way the world is.” (Ward 
2011a, p. 149). A journalist should therefore set aside his or her subjective opinion and 
exclude bias as much as possible. Reports must be coherent and empirically adequate. 
Ward adheres to the coherence theory of truth:
Truth refers to (a) interpretations that fit well with the best available conceptual scheme on a 
topic, or (b) theories (as complex interpretations) that offer a more coherent account than rival 
systems. The idea of truth for coherence theory is holistic, involving the coherence of many 
beliefs. This stress on coherence fits very well pragmatic inquiry’s idea of interpretations as 
the product of conceptualization and theorizing. (Ward 2011a, p. 146)
The question of what truth is is therefore not only relevant for journalism, it is the pivotal 
point in the debate on post-factualism. Is there such a thing as objective truth? How can it 
be defined and recognized? Is truth merely a social construct? In philosophy, there is no 
single definition of truth; rather, different competing theories of truth have been devel­
oped, such as the correspondence theory or the coherence theory. In the next chapter, I will 
present an overview of these different philosophical approaches and propose an epistemo­
logical model that is suitable to mediate between these opposing positions.
2  Post-Truth Epistemology

Facticity and Truth
Post-factualism rejects a metaphysical concept of truth, declares truth to be a social phe­
nomenon and thus detaches it from reality. Even if post-factualism with its relativistic 
tendencies appears unacceptable, it nevertheless represents a challenge for philosophy and 
media theory, because it has some strong epistemological arguments that cannot be 
ignored: First, there is the context-dependence of meanings as well as the perspectivity 
and social origin of knowledge. Absolute truths and indisputable facts do not exist; rather, 
they are always theory-laden and in need of interpretation. We perceive the world from a 
particular perspective, which is historically, culturally and socially shaped. If there are no 
perspective-independent facts and if reality is cognitively inaccessible to us, how can we 
distinguish between truth and fake? If we want to save the concept of truth and not let it 
fall prey to relativism, we need an epistemology that does not make truth an arbitrarily 
negotiable, socially constructed agreement, but that ties it to reality. In this chapter I will 
give an overview of different theories of truth, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and 
present the model of perspectival realism, which presents a compromise between perspec­
tivism and realism.

The Correspondence Theory of Truth
The correspondence theory of truth states that a proposition is true if it corresponds to 
reality. In the twentieth century some thought-provoking objections have been raised 
against this theory. But despite this legitimate criticism, we have to remind ourselves that 
we use the correspondence theory successfully in everyday life, when we want to know 
whether a statement is true or not. Correspondence theory assumes realism and does not 
make truth an arbitrary discursive construction. This distinguishes it from other theories of 
truth and is its biggest asset. If someone claims that there is a robin sitting on the tree in

the garden, then the truth of this proposition can be easily verified by observation. We 
simply look if it is true by comparing the asserted fact with what we see. If the proposition 
and reality correspond, then the proposition is true; and if not, then it is false.
But it is not quite that simple. Let us consider the sentence “It is raining”. Is the sen­
tence true, if only a few drops fall? How many drops must fall per minute per square meter 
to confirm that it is raining? Our colloquial language is notoriously imprecise. Rain is a 
vague term whose range of extension has fuzzy boundaries. One can eliminate such vague­
ness by defining the term precisely, for example, by specifying truth conditions and defin­
ing what amount of precipitation must be measured that the sentence “It is raining” is true. 
Such definitions are arbitrary and are based on social conventions, but they establish 
uniqueness.

Let us now consider the proposition A1: “The Eiffel Tower is 300 m high.” Again, we 
can say that the sentence is true because it describes a fact, let’s call it T1. Let’s compare it 
with the proposition A2: “The Eiffel Tower is taller than 200 m.” This sentence is also true. 
The fact described here is more general than A1, since it allows for more possibilities. We 
can imagine at will any other sentences that generalize the fact A1, e.g.
1 TLP = Tractatus logico-philosophicus.

81
A3: “The Eiffel Tower is not 200 meters high.”
A4: “The Eiffel Tower is 300 meters high or it’s raining in Paris.”
They describe different facts. The mere fact that the Eiffel Tower is 300 m high makes all 
these propositions A2, A3 and A4 true. David Armstrong refers to facts as truthmakers and 
understands them as parts of reality by which a proposition becomes true (Armstrong 
2004, p. 5). The truthmaker theory provides an explanation for the Eiffel Tower example 
above. For truthmakers the entailment principle holds: if T is a truthmaker for proposition 
p and if proposition q follows from p, then T is also a truthmaker for q (Armstrong 2004, 
p. 10). In the Eiffel Tower example, the truthmaker of A1 is also a truthmaker for the 
propositions A2, A3 and A4, because the propositions A2, A3 and A4 all follow from A1.
­

Another problem concerns the correspondence relation: What does it mean that a true 
proposition corresponds to a fact? What is the correspondence relation? Does it mean that 
a proposition is the same as a fact? In any case, such a coincidence of proposition and fact 
cannot be meant, for then proposition and fact could not be distinguished (Frege 1984, 
p. 353). Another possibility would be that the idea expressed in a proposition coincides 
with reality. But Frege rejects this possibility as well, because reality and ideas are cate­
gorically different and therefore there can be no exact correspondence of both. It would be 
like comparing apples with pears and looking for a correspondence. Between such things 
2 Armstrong speaks of a “huge general truth”, which states the existence of all things. This general 
truth implies in particular all negative truths such as “There are no unicorns” or “There is no bald 
king of France”. Therefore, the whole universe would be a truthmaker for all negative truths 
(Armstrong 2007).
3.1  The Correspondence Theory of Truth

one can indeed find similarities, but no correspondence. But we want truth, not half-truths, 
“for what is only half true is untrue” (Frege 1984, p. 353).
A fact is a part of material reality and thus something outside language. In order to 
compare two things, a tertium comparationis is needed, that is a property with respect to 
which a proposition and a fact can be compared. But what is this third kind beyond propo­
sitions and facts? Propositions and facts are ontologically distinct. Martin Heidegger 
(1998, p. 140) explains this difference using the example of the proposition “This coin is 
round”: What are the proposition and the coin supposed to have in common? The coin is 
made of metal, the proposition is immaterial. The coin is round and occupies a certain 
volume. The proposition is neither round nor does it have any spatial shape. The coin can 
be used to buy something. A proposition has no monetary value. We can only compare 
things that belong to the same ontological category, that is, we can compare propositions 
with propositions, but not propositions with facts.
Correspondence is often defined as structural equality or isomorphism. True proposi­
tions are supposed to depict the relations between things. Wittgenstein explains this in his 
picture theory of language as follows: Language is a picture of reality. True propositions 
depict facts. That something can be depicted at all, there must be something identical in 
the picture and what it depicts (TLP 2.161). What picture and depicted have in common is 
what Wittgenstein calls the “logico-pictorial form” (TLP 2.2). Objects stand in relation to 
each other and this relation is represented in a proposition. True propositions and facts are 
therefore structurally isomorphic. The sentence “The Empire State Building is taller than 
the Eiffel Tower” expresses a comparison of height between the two buildings. This rela­
tion is linguistically represented by the expression “is taller than”.
However, this explanation does not get us any further. In the example of the height 
comparison, this may still seem plausible. But logical connectives do not necessarily have 
a simple equivalent in reality. Let us take as an example a compound sentence that consists 
of a disjunction of two single propositions:
C: “In Berlin, the sun is shining or it’s raining.”
Here one might think that the corresponding fact is composed of sunshine and rain. But the 
disjunction is true even if only one of the two partial statements is true. Suppose that in 
Berlin the sun is shining, but it is not raining. Here we can no longer say that the corre­
sponding complex fact contains both simple facts. Since it does not rain in Berlin, this fact 
does not occur in reality. The fact consists only of the sunshine in Berlin and does not 
represent the disjunction. Therefore, there is no structural isomorphism.
It is not clear what Wittgenstein means by “logical form”. Jaakko and Merrill Hintikka 
(1983, p. 156) think that logical form is a modal concept and that only possible facts are 
represented in a sentence. In a diary entry of 29.9.1914 Wittgenstein (NB, p. 7e) writes: 
“In the proposition a world is as it were put together experimentally. (As when in the law-­
court in Paris a motor-car accident is represented by means of dolls, etc.).” Presumably the 
bracketed remark refers to the report of a trial in which a car accident was reconstructed in 
3  Facticity and Truth

83
a miniature model, which Wittgenstein read about in a newspaper and which lead him to 
the idea of understanding language as a picture of reality (von Wright 2001, p.  8). 
Propositions represent possible states of affairs. Viewed in this way, a disjunction could be 
seen as a combination of two possible states of affairs, like in a model, namely that it is 
raining and that the sun is shining. The sentence C then does not represent reality, but pos­
sible realities. It leaves three possible states of affairs open:
	1.	 In Berlin the sun is shining and it is raining.
	2.	 In Berlin the sun is shining and it is not raining.
	3.	 In Berlin the sun is not shining and it is raining.
The proposition C is true if and only if one of the three states of affairs is true. Wittgenstein 
would presumably speak here of a “configuration of objects” in a “logical space” (cf. TLP 
2.0272 + 2.11). However, this still does not clarify which fact the proposition C depicts. A 
fact, after all, is supposed to be a part of reality and not something that exists in other pos­
sible worlds.
These considerations show that facts and truthmakers are very strange entities. For 
example, what is the corresponding fact of “2 + 2 = 4”? Or how can counterfactual truths 
such as “If Napoleon had conquered England, he would have abolished the English legal 
system” be explained? Leaving aside the problem of what ontological structure facts have, 
there is the very simple question: to what fact, for instance, should the statement that snow 
is white correspond? An obvious answer to this question would be: It is precisely the fact 
that snow is white. In describing the fact, the sentence is simply repeated. The fact is 
expressed in exactly the same words as the sentence itself. Despite this paradoxical formu­
lation, this formula is continually repeated in philosophy: the proposition “snow is white” 
is true if and only if snow is white. It is not apparent what the difference is supposed to be 
between the proposition and the fact described in it. It is emphasized that a fact is a non-­
linguistic entity. Nevertheless, facts can only be described linguistically and can only be 
identified by propositions. If facts are not independent of their linguistic description, then 
a proposition is not confronted with reality, but only two linguistic descriptions are com­
pared with each other (cf. Williams 2001, p. 140). Davidson (1990, p. 304) therefore con­
cludes that correspondence theories “fail to provide entities to which truth vehicles 
(whether we take these to be statements, sentences, or utterances) can be said to 
correspond”.
Robert Nozick raises the suspicion that the ontological categories by which we describe 
facts are projections of grammatical categories and that reality therefore has the same 
structure as its linguistic image. By describing things, facts and events linguistically, we 
project grammatical structures into the world and believe that the facts are structurally 
isomorphic to the sentences:
We do not yet know what the components of facts are. Are there ultimate components (abso­
lute atoms)? There is a temptation to say that the components are things or objects, their

84
properties and their relations. But this accords too well with grammatical categories, and so it 
raises the suspicion that linguistic units are being projected as ontological categories. (Nozick 
2001, p. 73 f.)
Since linguistic descriptions of facts depend on conceptual schemes and categories, truth 
is also relative to these schemes. As a consequence, the truth of a proposition does not only 
depend on the fact it corresponds to, but also on the conceptual schemes and theories it is 
based on. C.I. Lewis (1956, p. 271) and William James (1959, p. 172) consider the possi­
bility that there could be alternative conceptual schemes that organize and structure expe­
rience differently and therefore produce different truths.
The thesis of structural isomorphism of language and reality makes sense only if reality 
has a structure at all and if we can conceive this structure conceptually and describe it 
linguistically. But actually we project our own concepts onto the world and we pretend 
that they are real ontological categories. Concepts exist in our minds, not in reality. It 
remains a mystery how we can compare propositions with a non-conceptual reality. We 
can only compare propositions with propositions, but not propositions with facts. In order 
to compare the two elements of the truth relation, we would have to adopt a standpoint 
outside the world, a god’s eye point of view, from which facts are immediately accessible 
to us. Since we cannot look at the world from outside with god’s eyes, because we live in 
the world, we can only take an internal perspective and compare statements and theories 
with each other, that is, we can only compare things of the same kind.
Another problem with the correspondence theory is scientific progress. For example, if 
we want to know how far the earth is from the sun, how dangerous the Corona virus is, or 
whether there is man-made climate change, we ask scientists. Science seems to be the 
supreme authority when it comes to questions of truth. But science can only give provi­
sional answers. When asked what the smallest constituents of matter are, elementary par­
ticle physicists would say: according to the standard model, there are only quarks, leptons, 
gauge bosons and Higgs particles. In the early twentieth century, the answer would have 
been different. In Rutherford’s atomic model there were only electrons and atomic nuclei. 
And in 100 years, the answer could be different again: It could be superstrings or other 
exotic objects that make up matter. In other words: What is true today may be false tomor­
row. Strictly speaking, there are no hypotheses in the natural sciences that are unalterably 
true. Scientific models represent simplifications and idealizations, and presuppose condi­
tions that are not met in nature. The law of free fall, for example, considers bodies as point 
masses, neglects air resistance, pretends that free fall takes place in a vacuum and assumes 
that no forces other than gravity act on a falling body. Only under these assumptions, a 
metal ball and a feather fall at the same rate. Laws of nature do not describe facts, but are 
the result of idealizations. They are therefore not true – at least not in the correspondence-­
theoretic sense (cf. Gadenne 2015, p. 17; Zoglauer 1993, p. 222). In a sense, the laws of 
nature “lie,” as the title of Nancy Cartwright’s book (1983) suggests. But can’t theories be 
at least approximately true?
3  Facticity and Truth

85
3.2	
Approximate Truth
In the research process, old theories are constantly replaced by new and better theories. A 
theory cannot be true if it can be discarded at any time and replaced by another, “truer” 
theory. For example, the laws of Newtonian mechanics cannot be said to be absolutely 
“true”. For these laws turn out to be special cases of more general theories such as relativ­
ity or quantum theory. But also the laws of quantum mechanics cannot be true, if one does 
not want to give up hope for better and more general theories. We usually assume that truth 
has no degrees and that we therefore cannot speak of gradually “truer” theories. Popper 
(1962) introduced the notion of verisimilitude, meaning that theories become increasingly 
more truth-like as science progresses: they converge towards a true theory.
Popper sees the falsification of theories as a driver of progress, bringing them closer to 
the truth. Refutations contribute to progress by eliminating unsuccessful theories and 
replacing them with better theories. Thus, the goal of research is not truth per se, but grow­
ing truth proximity. The problem with this conception of progress is that it presupposes a 
measure of truth proximity, or criteria for deciding whether one theory is closer to the truth 
than another. This would be the only possibility how two competing theories can be com­
pared in terms of their closeness to truth. According to Popper, the more easily a hypoth­
esis can be falsified, the greater its empirical content. Put simply, a theory T2 is better, i.e. 
more truth-like, than its predecessor theory T1, if T2 can explain and predict more facts 
than T1 and passes more experimental tests successfully (Popper 1962, p. 232).
Boyd (1983), Leplin (1981), Newton-Smith (1983) and Aronson (1989) believe that the 
historical sequence of better and better theories converges towards a true theory. This is the 
reason why this approach is called “convergent realism”. This theory introduces a teleo­
logical notion of progress, which assumes that the research process is goal-directed. The 
convergence thesis is based on the progress in making more precise measurements of 
fundamental constants of nature and the growing correspondence of theories with the mea­
sured data in many areas (Vollmer 1993, p. 172). Convergent realism claims, first, that 
there is such a thing as a final “theory of everything” towards which theories converge and, 
second, that convergence is not only qualitative in nature but can also be quantified. But 
what does convergence mean and how can it be quantified?
Rosenberg (1988) points out that the quantitative notion of convergence presupposes a 
measure of the “distance” of a theory from the final “true theory”. But until we know the 
final theory, we cannot determine the convergence of theories Tn. A possible way out is 
offered by Cauchy’s notion of convergence, which requires that the distance between any 
two theories Tm and Tn in the historical sequence tends to zero: d(Tm, Tn) → 0. But again, 
the problem of how we can measure the “distance” between two theories remains unsolved. 
Quite apart from this, it is not clear why this sequence should converge at all (Rosenberg 
1988, p. 173).
The convergence thesis also has the paradoxical consequence that generally accepted 
common-sense truths are less truthful than our latest scientific theories. For newer theories 
3.2  Approximate Truth

are closer to the truth than older theories. But why should the proposition “This tomato is 
red”, even if it can be directly confirmed by perception, be further from the truth than the 
proposition “The light reflected from the tomato has a wavelength of 710 nm”?
To avoid these problems, Psillos proposes to abandon the notion of convergence and to 
speak instead of an approximate fittingness of theories to experience: “According to these 
intuitions, a theory is approximately true if the entities of the general kind postulated to 
play a central causal role in the theory exist, and if the basic mechanisms and laws postu­
lated by the theory approximate those holding in the world, under specific conditions of 
approximation”. (Psillos 1999, p. 267) Psillos explains this with the example of celestial 
mechanics. Planetary observation provides a lot of measurement data, for example, about 
the positions of Mars. A good theory should be able to establish an accurate model of the 
Mars orbit and to calculate the planetary positions exactly. The smaller the deviation 
between the theoretically determined positions and the observed positions, the better the 
theory fits reality and the more likely it is that the theory is approximately true. Psillos is 
aware that we will never obtain an exact match, this is why convergence is unrealistic. The 
reason is because the theory makes idealizing assumptions that are not satisfied in reality. 
For example, Newton’s model treats the orbit of Mars as a two-body problem, considers 
only the gravitational effects of the Sun and Mars, and neglects the gravitational forces of 
other planets. In contrast to Popper’s theory of verisimilitude, truth is here no longer 
understood as correspondence to reality, but only as a relative adjustment of a theory to 
experience.
The predictive and retrodictive success of a theory is of prime importance, i.e. how well 
the theory can reproduce measured data and how well it can predict data. The inference 
goes from the success of the theory to its truth. This connection between success and truth 
is regarded as the pivotal argument for scientific realism. It is said that only realism could 
satisfactorily explain why our theories can make correct empirical predictions, why this 
success increases over time, and why there is any scientific progress at all (Almeder 1989; 
Leplin 1981). If theories could not describe reality at least approximately correctly, their 
apparent success would be a miracle, as Smart (1963) and Putnam (1975) emphasize. 
Hilary Putnam (1975, p. 73) has expressed this “no-miracle argument” very succinctly:
The positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy that doesn’t make the suc­
cess of science a miracle. That terms in mature scientific theories typically refer (this formula­
tion is due to Richard Boyd), that the theories accepted in a mature science are typically 
approximately true, that the same term can refer to the same thing even when it occurs in 
different theories – these statements are viewed by the scientific realist not as necessary truths 
but as part of the only scientific explanation of the success of science, and hence as part of any 
adequate scientific description of science and its relations to its objects.
The no-miracle argument can be reconstructed as follows:
	1.	 Science is successful.
3  Facticity and Truth

87
	2.	 The best explanation for the success of science is to assume that successful scientific 
theories are approximately true.
	3.	 If successful theories were not approximately true, their success would be a miracle.
	4.	 Therefore, successful scientific theories must be at least approximately true.
The argument infers the approximate truth of a theory from its success, using an inference 
to the best explanation. The inference to the best explanation is not a compelling logical 
argument, because it offers only one possible explanation for the success of a theory and 
leaves open whether there are other possible explanations. It merely asserts that among all 
possible explanations for the success of a theory, approximate truth is the best explanation. 
Such conclusions are valid only with a certain probability (Harman 1965).
Scientific models can be successful even if they are not an exact replica of reality. Peter 
Lipton (2005) compares a theory with a map: Suppose we want to travel from location A 
to location B, we use a map for orientation. The map does not represent all the topographi­
cal features of the area around A and B. If the map is a road map, no mountains or valleys 
are drawn. Geology and vegetation will usually not be of interest for a motorist. To suc­
cessfully get from A to B, a motorist only needs to know which roads connect the two 
places. The map must show the roads, the motorway access and exit roads, as well as 
service stations and petrol stations. Most other details can be omitted because they are not 
important for the motorist. That is, a map depicts only those features of the world that are 
pragmatically relevant. A map is not a one-to-one representation of reality. The map of the 
London Underground (London Tube Map) shows only the network of lines and stops; the 
map depicts connections but not real-world distance relationships. Other maps show ter­
ritories and country borders, i.e. conventional entities that do not exist in nature. World 
maps that depict the whole earth are always distorted in perspective, depending on which 
projection method is used. They are either true to angle or true to area, but cannot be both 
at the same time. A map can therefore never depict the world in a structurally isomorphic 
way, but can only show certain features and provide a user-oriented perspective. Different 
maps provide different perspectives on the world, and users choose the perspective that is 
most useful for their purposes. A satellite photo from Google Earth may depict reality 
more accurately than a road map. However, road maps are more useful to a car driver than 
Google Earth.
The same is true for scientific theories. Truth or approximate truth in the sense of struc­
tural correspondence is not necessary for their success. False theories can also be success­
ful. Larry Laudan (1981) listed many historical examples of theories that were all very 
successful in their time, but which are regarded false today because they postulate the 
existence of objects that do not exist in reality, such as epicycles in ancient and medieval 
astronomy, the phlogiston in eighteenth-century chemistry, vital forces in physiology, or 
the ether in nineteenth-century physics. Conversely, approximately true theories that refer 
to real objects need not necessarily be successful. Laudan therefore concludes:
3.2  Approximate Truth

88
The fact that a theory’s central terms refer does not entail that it will be successful, and a 
theory’s success is no warrant for the claim that all or most of its central terms refer. The 
notion of approximate truth is presently too vague to permit one to judge whether a theory 
consisting entirely of approximately true laws would be empirically successful. What is clear 
is that a theory may be empirically successful even if it is not approximately true. (Laudan 
1981, p. 47)
From the success of a theory we can conclude its empirical adequacy in the sense of 
Psillos, namely that it matches the observational and measured data. Hence Bas van 
Fraassen makes the following statement:
[T]he aim of science is not truth as such but only empirical adequacy, that is, truth with 
respect to the observable phenomena. Acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that the 
theory is empirically adequate (but acceptance involves more than belief). (…) the criterion 
of success is not truth in every respect, but only truth with respect to what is actual and 
observable. (Fraassen 1989, p. 192 f.)
Despite all the criticisms of scientific realism and the correspondence theory of truth that 
underlies it, we can claim: Our best available scientific theories are very successful. If we 
look at the history of science, we can see that our theories are better and better adapted to 
empirical data and that their empirical adequacy therefore increases. We cannot know 
whether a theory is true in the metaphysical sense. We can only judge whether a theory is 
successful in the sense of empirical adequacy. Therefore, it makes sense to define truth in 
terms of success. In doing so we replace the metaphysical concept of truth with a prag­
matic one. We will examine in the next chapter whether a pragmatic theory of truth is 
better suited than a correspondence theory to explain truth.
3.3	
The Pragmatic Theory of Truth
Pragmatism is a philosophical movement that was founded at the end of the nineteenth and 
beginning of the twentieth century by Ch. S. Peirce, William James and John Dewey and 
has had a lasting influence on American philosophy up to the present day. William James 
became one of its most famous protagonists with his book “Pragmatism” (1959), first 
published in 1907, in which he attacks the correspondence theory and introduces a prag­
matic concept of truth. He takes up an idea of Immanuel Kant, according to which our 
mind makes use of certain forms of intuition and categories to bring order into the confus­
ing manifold of sensory impressions. James reinterprets Kant’s transcendental philosophy 
pragmatically and regards concepts as useful tools to cope with reality. Conceptual sys­
tems serve a practical purpose. Substance and causality are not innate concepts, they do 
not denote anything real, but are free constructions of the human mind that are highly 
useful to us and help us to understand the world and make it intelligible. Science intro­
duces hypothetical objects like the ether, electric fields, and virtual particles and deals with 
3  Facticity and Truth

89
them as if they exist. In reality, however, they are merely useful fictions and tools to explain 
natural phenomena.
James presents several definitions of truth. First, truth is equated with usefulness (James 
1959, p. 203), then truth is explained as that “which gives us the maximum possible sum 
of satisfactions” (ibid., p. 217) and “the expedient in the way of our thinking” (ibid., 
p. 222) and at another time truth means nothing else than verifiability (ibid., p. 220). James 
claims that if an idea is successful, then it is true. Against this identification of truth with 
success Russell mockingly objected: “if Germany had been victorious [in World War 2], 
pragmatists would have had to hail the Nazi creed as pragmatically ‘true’.” (Russell 1975, 
p. 132). A functionalization and purpose-orientation of the concept of truth must indeed be 
viewed critically. For even a lie can be useful and successful, providing satisfaction to the 
liar. As Laudan has shown, false theories can also be successful, and assumptions that later 
turn out to be correct can fail the practical test. Fatally, for James it isn’t so important 
whether an opinion is really useful, what matters to him is that it conveys just the feeling 
to be useful. A belief must provide satisfaction. Hence James speaks of “satisfaction” as a 
criterion of truth: “The matter of the true is thus absolutely identical with the matter of the 
satisfactory.” (James 1909, p. 159 f.)
Russell suspects that James’s main concern with his pragmatic definition of truth was 
“to find some way of asserting that the statement ‘God exists’ is true without involving 
himself in metaphysics” (Russell 1975, p. 134). Belief in God has proven to be beneficial. 
Religion strengthens social cohesion, creates a common spirit, admonishes people to 
behave morally, and helps them to cope with contingency. But can we conclude from the 
usefulness of religious belief the existence of God? If all that matters is a feeling of satis­
faction, then, as Russell notes, two people can hold opposing views and still both feel 
satisfaction in doing so (Russell 1975, p. 134). Does it follow that both are right? If so, 
then two contradicting statements could both be true and the law of non-contradiction 
would not hold. Such a consequence would be deeply counterintuitive.
From the perspective of pragmatism, even such obvious falsehoods as Trump’s claim 
that the 2020 presidential election was rigged can pass for truth. The idea that he actually 
won the election gives Trump a personal satisfaction and flatters his narcissism. If his sup­
porters are also convinced of this, they will support him with donations in his hopeless 
legal battle to declare the election results null and void, which benefits him politically and 
financially. Trump can therefore say with full pragmatic conviction: what I say is true.
What is useful and what is not depends on one’s personal perspective. We have to ask 
ourselves for whom and for what something is supposed to be useful. Theories about neu­
trinos, Higgs bosons and black holes may be extremely useful for a physicist, but hardly 
for ordinary people, for whom it is more important to plug the black holes in their house­
hold budgets.
The criterion of verifiability does not get us anywhere either. For how can we as outsid­
ers be able to verify the assertion of another person who says: “I have a headache”? After 
all, we can’t see inside another person’s mind. And some scientific hypotheses, such as 
that there is life on other planets, can probably never be verified, even if they are true. As 
3.3  The Pragmatic Theory of Truth

90
we know from the history of science, the methods and means of verification can change 
over time. What was in principle unverifiable before can be empirically verified later. As a 
consequence, truths would also change.
James believes in realism and regards the existence of things as a prerequisite for their 
usefulness to us (James 1909, p. 207). But he does not explain the relation between realism 
and pragmatism. Is usefulness a criterion of reality? Does Santa Claus exist, if believing 
in him makes us happy? The pragmatist wants to liberate the concept of truth from its 
metaphysical baggage and anchor it in the reality of human life. In rejecting the correspon­
dence theory, James cuts the bond that connects propositions to reality. Truth becomes a 
social construction. In this view, truth is not discovered, but made.
Richard Rorty, a modern representative of American pragmatism, is much more consis­
tent than James and advocates a radical anti-realism. He rejects the realist notion of 
“world” and is happy with the “world well lost” (Rorty 1972). He believes that we can well 
do without a concept of truth:
The intuitive realist thinks that there is such a thing as philosophical truth because he thinks 
that, deep down beneath all the texts, there is something which is not just one more text but 
that to which various texts are trying to be ‘adequate’. The pragmatist does not think that there 
is anything like that. He does not even think that there is anything isolable as “the purposes 
which we construct vocabularies and cultures to fulfill” against which to test vocabularies and 
cultures. (Rorty 1982, p. xxxvii)
Rorty separates language from the world and makes truth a purely language-immanent 
phenomenon (Rorty 1989, p. 5). Truth, for him, does not exist independently of language. 
Truth is not “out there,” it is part of a language game: “The world does not speak. Only we 
do.” (Rorty 1989, p. 6) A proposition is true not because it corresponds to reality, but 
because it is believed to be true. True is “what is good in the way of belief” (Rorty 1982, 
p. 162). Truth is identified with justifiability. A proposition is true if it can be justified: 
“There is simply the process of justifying beliefs to audiences.” (Rorty 1999, p. 36) If the 
audience accepts the justification, then the proposition is true. Rorty views justification as 
a social phenomenon “rather than a transaction between ‘the knowing subject’ and ‘real­
ity’” (Rorty 1979, p. 9).
As an example, consider the successful prediction of a solar eclipse. What makes the 
prediction true? Is it the mere fact that the scientific audience applauds because the predic­
tion came true? Is it true because it is part of an academic language game or because the 
scientist has calculated correctly? Isn’t it rather the case that the prediction turned out to 
be true because of the way the world is: because the earth, the sun, and the moon were in 
such a position relative to each other at the predicted time that the moon’s total shadow 
obscured the area where the eclipse is observed?
Simon Blackburn (2005, p. 157 ff.), in his critique of Rorty, takes up Lipton’s (2005) 
map example to defend the realist interpretation of true statements. Suppose a pilgrim 
wants to visit a chapel and picks up a map to find it. If he reaches his destination by using 
the map, we would say that the map correctly depicts the landscape. The success of the 
3  Facticity and Truth

91
pilgrim is not based solely on technical map conventions, e.g. by which symbol the chapel 
is represented, or on social practices of map makers and map users, but at least partially on 
the correct representation of reality: “That is why, once a set of conventions has been put 
in place, a map can be correct or incorrect. In other words, it can represent the landscape 
as it is, or represent the landscape as it is not.” (Blackburn 2005, p. 157) The pilgrim, hav­
ing arrived at his destination, may feel a sense of satisfaction, he may praise the usefulness 
of the map, and other travellers may verify the correct representation: all these things are 
not causes but effects of correct representation. What makes a proposition true is not the 
social practice of people, but it is reality itself.
3.4	
The Deflationary Theory of Truth
One argument against the correspondence theory of truth implies that facts can only be 
described linguistically, and that truth is thus an intra-linguistic phenomenon. Rorty con­
siders the concept of truth to be superfluous, metaphysically overloaded, and philosophi­
cally overrated. Basically, he contends that the use of the word “true” merely fulfills a 
pragmatic function in order to affirm statements. With this claim Rorty places himself in 
the tradition of the deflationary theory of truth, which was advocated in different versions 
by Ramsey, Ayer, Belnap and Horwich in the twentieth century and which pursued the 
goal of demystifying the concept of truth and reducing it to its colloquial use. Truth, 
according to this view, is not a mysterious property that belongs to propositions, but merely 
a rhetorical device of assertion. When one says that a proposition p is true, the expression 
“true” is actually superfluous, because the mere assertion of p already implies its truth. 
“Snow is white” is true if and only if snow is white. The affirmation “… is true” adds no 
new information to the statement and can therefore be omitted. According to this view, the 
concept of truth is redundant. For Paul Horwich, truth is not further analysable: “truth is 
not susceptible to conceptual analysis and has no underlying nature” (Horwich 2004, 
p. 71). However, the deflationary theory of truth says nothing about how to verify the truth 
of a proposition. It does not provide truth criteria.
The deflationary theory of truth reduces the concept of truth to the simple Tarski 
scheme (T):
“p” is true if and only if p.
The elimination of the truth term is done by disquotation, by omitting the quotation marks 
in which the phrase “p” is bracketed. The Tarski formula represents a logical equivalence 
that can be read from left to right as well as from the right to the left side. It eliminates the 
truth term by referring to the corresponding object-language term p. Conversely, one can 
also add the affirmation “p is true” to any statement p without changing anything about the 
content of the statement. If I say “It is raining”, I want to express that I believe the proposi­
tion to be true and that I believe that it is indeed raining. I want the hearer to believe me 
3.4  The Deflationary Theory of Truth

92
and to be convinced of the truth of my assertion. As Habermas quite rightly states, asser­
toric speech acts automatically involve truth claims (Habermas 1995, p. 137 ff.).
Despite this consideration, we shall not forget that it still makes a difference whether I 
merely assume something or whether I am convinced of the truth of my assertion. Gottlob 
Frege, who is regarded as one of the founders of the deflationary theory of truth, agrees 
that the content of the propositions “p” and “p is true” is the same, but he qualifies his 
statement in saying that truth expresses more than a mere assumption:
It is also worth noting that the sentence “I smell the scent of violets” has just the same content 
as the sentence “It is true that I smell the scent of violets”. So it seems, then, that nothing is 
added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property of truth. And yet is it not a great result 
when the scientist after much hesitation and laborious researches can finally say “My conjec­
ture is true”? (Frege 1984, p. 354)
A truth assertion involves being able to give reasons and evidence for the truth of a propo­
sition, rather than merely assuming it. Speech acts can also be used in non-assertive ways. 
A statement p can be meant as an exaggeration, a compliment, an insult, or just ironically. 
It therefore makes a big difference whether one merely believes that something is true or 
whether the statement corresponds to reality. This difference is not expressed in the Tarski 
formula (T). If I say: “It is raining”, then I don’t just want to evoke intersubjective agree­
ment or express that it is useful to believe in it, but I want to say something about the world.
Paul Horwich (2004, p. 32 ff.) denies that there is a connection between truth and real­
ism. In the deflationary theory of truth, truth is not grounded in the world. Language is 
isolated from the world and truth is locked in the contextual network of language. This 
also means that there is no longer a criterion for distinguishing between truth and untruth. 
The mere assertion p makes it true, since “p” and “p is true” are logically equivalent.
Willard v. O. Quine is considered as one of the main representatives of a deflationary 
theory of truth. For him, truth is always relative to a language or to a theory: “Truth, for 
me, is immanent. Factuality, or matterhood of fact, is likewise immanent.” (Quine 1998, 
p. 367) Truth, for him, consists in disquotation: “Truth is disquotation.” (Quine 1987, 
p. 213) Nevertheless, he does not seem very comfortable with this conception of truth. On 
the one hand, he affirms that truth is immanent in language, but on the other hand he also 
says that it is not sentences that are true, but reality that makes them true:
Truth hinges on reality; but to object, on this score, to calling sentences true, is a confusion. 
Where the truth predicate has its utility is in just those places where, though still concerned 
with reality, we are impelled by certain technical complications to mention sentences. Here 
the truth predicate serves, as it were, to point through the sentence to the reality; it serves as a 
reminder that though sentences are mentioned, reality is still the whole point. (Quine 
1986, p. 11)
Language is a tool to describe the world. The truth predicate is a mediator between lan­
guage and the world: “What is true is the sentence, but its truth consists in the world’s 
being as the sentence says.” (Quine 1992, p. 81) In this statement, Quine sympathizes with 
3  Facticity and Truth

93
a correspondence theory of truth. Therefore, Davidson (2005, p. 85) doubts that Quine can 
be called a deflationist.
Quine traces the origin of truth back to observation sentences. Observation sentences 
are those sentences that are in direct contact with experience, such as “Snow is white,” “It 
is raining,” or “The cat is lying on the mat.” An observation sentence is true if all members 
of a speech community would agree with it (Quine 1974, p. 39; 2013; p. 39, 2019, p. 38). 
Quine avoids speaking of correspondence. Instead, he attributes the truth of observation 
sentences to intersubjective assent. But this criterion of truth does not solve the problem. 
For the speech community can agree to an observation sentence even if it is false, e.g., if 
the community falls prey to a collective deception or if it simply wants to believe it. Trump 
claimed that there were more people at his inauguration than at Obama’s oath ceremony. 
Trump’s supporters agreed with this claim, despite clear evidence of its falsity. A mere 
assertion or agreement by the speech community does not make a proposition true.
Nevertheless, it would be premature to criticize Quine on this point. What he describes 
in his book “Word and Object” (2013) is the ontogeny of language acquisition that is very 
much influenced by behaviorist learning theory. According to this theory, sensory stimuli 
cause immediate reactions in observers that lead them to utter certain observation sen­
tences and believe them to be true. We have to remind ourselves that the truth of observa­
tion sentences is always provisional because they merely mark the starting point of the 
cognitive process, but not its result. Observation sentences are verification instances for 
theories, but they are also theory-laden (Quine 1992, p.  7), revisable and fallible. 
Observations can fall prey to deception, the observer can make biased judgments, the 
observational and measurement instruments can be flawed, or a well-confirmed theory can 
show that there is a systematic measurement error. Quine compares observation and theory 
with two antagonistic forces, where sometimes one side prevails, other times the other: 
“Normally, observation is the tug that tows the ship of theory; but in an extreme case the 
theory pulls so hard that observation yields.” (Quine and Ullian 1978, p. 29).
In Quine’s holistic theory model, “our statements about the external world face the tri­
bunal of sensory experience not individually but only as a corporate body” (Quine 1963, 
p. 41). When theory and experience contradict each other, either the observation sentences 
or the theory must be revised. The crucial point here is to make the sentences fit each other 
in such a way that the theory is consistent with the observational data. In this context 
Quine refers to the coherence theory of truth, which has always been in competition with 
the correspondence theory. For Quine, coherence and correspondence are not competing 
concepts, but complement each other:
Coherence and correspondence, properly considered, are not rival theories of truth, but com­
plementary aspects. The coherence aspect has to do with how to arrive at truth, by the best of 
our lights. The correspondence aspect has to do with the relation of truths to what they say 
about. (Quine 1987, p. 214)
3.4  The Deflationary Theory of Truth

94
Quine sees a close connection between truth and the assumption of an external reality 
(Quine 1995, p. 67). Accordingly, coherence is a necessary condition for the whole theory 
to be consistent with reality. However, this leaves two questions unanswered: What is 
coherence and why is coherence an indicator of truth? We will see in the next chapter 
whether coherence theory can answer these questions.
3.5	
The Coherence Theory of Truth
Coherence theory has its roots in the idealistic philosophy of F.H. Bradley, Harold Joachim, 
and Brand Blanshard. The British idealists conceive reality as a unified, coherent whole 
and truth as an expression of this holistic unity. Bradley (1909, p. 492) writes:
Truth is an ideal expression of the Universe at once coherent and comprehensive. It must not 
conflict with itself and there must be no suggestion which fails to fall inside it. Perfect truth 
in short must realise the idea of a systematic whole.
In order to grasp truth, we would have to attain a complete knowledge of the world. This 
is only possible by approximation, which is why truth has different shades and allows for 
gradations. The more comprehensive and complete the system of knowledge, the truer it 
is. Therefore, truth is not a property of individual isolated propositions. Only a complete 
coherent system of propositions can be true. Joachim justifies this with the contextuality 
of propositions and explains this with the example of the sentence “Caesar crossed the 
Rubicon in the year 49 BC” (Joachim 1906, p. 104). In order to understand the sentence, 
one must know who Caesar was, what the Rubicon is, and why Caesar crossed the Rubicon. 
The singular event is connected to a whole chain of other historical events. Only on the 
background of this historical knowledge, in the context of Caesar’s biography and his 
political ambitions, does the sentence make sense. You have to know the whole story to 
understand the sentence. “The true is the whole,” as Hegel (2018, p. 13) says. Truth, for 
Joachim, is “systematic coherence.”
For Joachim, coherence is more than logical consistency (Joachim 1906, §  25). 
Blanshard characterizes a coherent system of knowledge by a high degree of inferential 
interconnectedness. All propositions support each other and do not contradict each other: 
“Fully coherent knowledge would be knowledge in which every judgment entailed, and 
was entailed by, the rest of the system.” (Blanshard 1964, p. 264) Since complete knowl­
edge, if we ever attain it, reflects the whole universe, there can only be one complete truth.
Coherence theory was taken up again in the 1930s by Otto Neurath, who was critical, 
or even hostile, to idealism. His main concern was to free philosophy and science from any 
metaphysical assumptions and to admit only empirically meaningful propositions. Neurath 
defended an uncompromising physicalism: a scientific theory should consist only of those 
propositions that can be reduced to verifiable physical propositions. The basis is formed 
by protocol sentences, the function of which is to check other empirical sentences for 
3  Facticity and Truth

95
validity. Protocol sentences are phrased in the third person singular and contain informa­
tion about the person, time, place, and content of an observation or measurement. For 
example, “Otto sees a white swan swimming on the lake at 3:13 pm”. By observing white 
swans, the hypothesis “All swans are white” can be confirmed. The observation of a black 
swan, on the other hand, would disprove the hypothesis.
However, Neurath doesn’t think that propositions are always evident and irrefutably 
true. A proposition can also turn out to be false if it is based on an error or a deception. 
Therefore, for Neurath, it is not possible to finally falsify universal propositions by obser­
vations. The proposition “Otto sees a black swan” stands in contradiction to the hypothesis 
“All swans are white”. Nevertheless, the incompatibility of the two propositions does not 
necessarily imply the falsity of the universal proposition. Otto could, after all, have been 
mistaken. This is the reason why a proposition cannot simply be compared with “reality”. 
A proposition can only be compared to other propositions. If a proposition can be inte­
grated into a system of existing propositions and can be made consistent with it, then it is 
true. If integration without contradiction is not possible, then either the statement must be 
rejected as false or the existing system of statements must be modified so that it can coexist 
with the new statement. The aim of research is to bring the propositions of natural science 
into agreement with as many protocol sentences as possible (Neurath 1983, p. 109).
If a statement is made, it is to be confronted with the totality of existing statements. If it agrees 
with them, it is joined to them; if it does not agree, it is called ‘untrue’ and rejected; or the 
existing complex of statements of science is modified so that the new statement can be incor­
porated; the latter decision is mostly taken with hesitation. There can be no other concept of 
‘truth’ for science. (Neurath 1983, p. 53)
Interestingly, Neurath does not use the term coherence, presumably to distance himself 
from idealistic theories of coherence. Basically, for Neurath, if he were to use the term, 
coherence means nothing else than consistency. Unlike the British idealists, Neurath 
(1983, p. 105) abandons the idea that there can be only one consistent system of hypoth­
eses. Which of the competing systems of propositions we choose is for him a matter of 
convention. In this way, Neurath anticipates the thesis of the empirical underdetermination 
of theories, which was later made famous by Quine: scientific theories cannot be built on 
a firm empirical foundation. Rather, theories are free-floating entities that need only be 
brought into agreement with experience. Neurath compares a theory to a ship that never 
comes into contact with solid ground and must be held together by repeated rebuilding: 
“We are like sailors who have to rebuild their ship on the open sea, without ever being able 
to dismantle it in dry-dock and reconstruct it from the best components.” (Neurath 
1983, p. 92).
Like Neurath, Nicholas Rescher also advocates coherentism, according to which 
knowledge does not rest on a firm foundation and cannot be traced back to indubitable 
basic propositions. Rescher (1973, p. 319) explains the difference to fundamentalism as 
follows:
3.5  The Coherence Theory of Truth

96
In a way, the coherentist approach is exactly the inverse of the foundationalist. The founda­
tionalist begins his epistemological work with a very small initial collection of absolutely 
certain truths from which he proceeds to work outwards by suitably additive procedures to 
arrive at a wider domain of truth; by contrast, the coherentist begins with a very large initial 
collection of insecure pretenders to truth from which he proceeds to work inwards by suitably 
eliminative procedures to arrive at a narrower domain of truth.
Rescher compares research with a jigsaw puzzle in which one tries to fit together as many 
pieces as possible and thus obtains, piece by piece, a more comprehensive and coherent 
picture of the world (Rescher 1973, p. 41). For Rescher, in contrast to Neurath, the starting 
point of the cognitive process are not protocol sentences. Rather, the knowledge system 
resembles an interconnected network in which all nodes of the network are of equal impor­
tance and no sentence can claim epistemic priority over others (Rescher 1974, p. 700). 
One starts with individual propositions, called data by Rescher, which are assumed to be 
true but whose truth is not certain. Data can be observations, reports, hypotheses, or con­
jectures. The initial system of propositions may be inconsistent. Individual elements of 
this system may contradict each other. The sentences are then tested to see if they fit 
together. A sentence is accepted as (provisionally) true if it coheres with all other sen­
tences. If not, individual sentences can be modified or removed from the knowledge sys­
tem. Or auxiliary hypotheses can be introduced to adapt a theory to the empirical data. In 
addition to theoretical coherence, Rescher introduces the criterion of pragmatic efficacy: 
the system of knowledge must not only be coherent at the theoretical level, but must also 
be successful at the practical level (Rescher 1992, p. 175).
It can be objected that the concept of coherence remains vague and unspecific in 
Rescher’s work. It is not clear what coherence is supposed to be more than consistency. It 
is therefore necessary to specify the concept of coherence. Laurence Bonjour (1985, 
pp. 95–99) lists five coherence criteria that a knowledge system must meet:
	1.	 A system of beliefs is coherent only if it is logically consistent.
	2.	 A system of beliefs is coherent in proportion to its degree of probabilistic consistency.
	3.	 The coherence of a system of beliefs is increased by the presence of inferential connec­
tions between its component beliefs and increased in proportion to the number and 
strength of such connections.
	4.	 The coherence of a system of beliefs is diminished to the extent to which it is divided 
into subsystems of beliefs which are relatively unconnected to each other by inferential 
connections.
	5.	 The coherence of a system of beliefs is decreased in proportion to the presence of unex­
plained anomalies in the believed content of the system.
Conspiracy theories are highly incoherent according to these criteria: they are probabilisti­
cally inconsistent because they are based on improbable assumptions. They consist of a 
hodgepodge of ad hoc hypotheses and belief postulates with few inferential connections. 
3  Facticity and Truth

97
Conflicting evidence is simply ignored or neutralized by the addition of more conspiracy 
hypotheses. As Kuhn (1970) has shown, anomalies can occur in even the best scientific 
theories and cause a crisis. In contrast to conspiracy theories, crises are taken seriously in 
science and lead to a reconstruction of the theoretical system that can culminate in a sci­
entific revolution. Such paradigm shifts are prevented in the case of conspiracy theories, 
since they try to protect their incoherent worldview under all circumstances and immunize 
themselves against any criticism.
­

Anyone who takes coherence seriously as the sole criterion of truth must consider any fabri­
cated tale to be no less true than a historical report or the propositions in a chemistry text-­
book, so long as the tale is well enough fashioned to harbour no contradictions anywhere. 
(Schlick 1979, p. 376)
Russell objects to the coherence theory that there can be multiple, equally coherent belief 
systems:
It may be that, with sufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world that 
would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different from the real past. (Russell 
2001, p. 71)
The coherence theory, so the objection, cannot convincingly explain why there can be only 
one coherent overall system. It could be possible that there are several equally coherent 
belief systems. The decisive question is therefore whether increasing coherence automati­
cally leads to truth in the sense of correspondence and what the connection is between 
coherence and correspondence.
Coherence is an internal relation between propositions of a belief system. If a system is 
only internally tested for coherence and never externally confronted with reality, it is 
claimed, coherentism would become a kind of unrealistic idealism and anti-realism. It 
seem as if our cognitive system is epistemically closed and that there is no input. So the 
question arises: How can coherentism be reconciled with realism?
Rescher’s response to this is that the goal should not be internal coherence, but “coher­
ence with our experience” (Rescher 1992, p. 174). In this link to empiricism, Rescher’s 
3 Like Schlick, C.I. Lewis points out that also a pack of lies can be coherent and consistent: “A suf­
ficiently magnificent liar, however, or one who was given time and patiently followed a few simple 
rules of logic, could eventually present us with any number of systems, as comprehensive as you 
please, and all of them including falsehoods”. (Lewis 1946, p. 340)

and Neurath’s coherentism differs from idealistic theories of coherence. Rescher regards 
the assumption of an external reality as a basic prerequisite for the possibility of knowl­
edge (Rescher 1992, p. 270). For him, truth and realism are closely connected:
We need the notion of reality to operate the conception of truth. A factual statement on the 
order of “There are pi-mesons” is true if and only if the world is such that pi-mesons exist 
within it. By virtue of their very nature as truths, true statements must state facts: they state 
what really is so, which is exactly what it is to characterize reality. (Rescher 1992, p. 260)
Rescher therefore endorses a correspondence theory of truth. The contact to reality is 
established by the practical success of a theory. And Bonjour, too, sees no contradiction in 
combining a coherence theory with a correspondence theory of truth (Bonjour 1985, 
p. 88). It has to be shown that increasing coherence of knowledge leads to an increasing 
correspondence between theory and reality. To solve this problem, Bonjour constructs a 
“metajustificatory argument” for the coherence theory to connect coherence and corre­
spondence, justification and truth. It is to show that beliefs that are justified in terms of the 
coherence theory are true, or at least tend to be true, in terms of the correspondence theory. 
The realist must convince the skeptic “that someone with a (more or less) coherent set of 
beliefs has a reason to suppose his beliefs are not mistaken in the main,” as Davidson 
(2001, p. 146) puts it. Bonjour is convinced that coherent theories converge towards a true 
description of the world (Bonjour 1985, p. 170). But why should coherent systems of 
beliefs evolve toward truth? It may be quite possible that they lead away from truth, or that 
they move in circles (Christlieb 1986, p. 401).
To close this explanatory gap, Bonjour introduces the principle of metajustification. It 
states that a system of beliefs that remains coherent and stable over the long run and that 
receives constant empirical input is increasingly likely to correspond to reality (Bonjour 
1985, p. 171). Davidson argues along the same lines as Bonjour. Like Bonjour, Davidson 
concludes from coherence to the truth of a theory, because a high degree of coherence 
enhances the probability that “many of our beliefs are true.” (Davidson 2001, p. 137). The 
connection between coherence and truth is a probabilistic one: if our beliefs are coherent, 
then they are likely to be true:
The presumption increases the larger and more significant the body of beliefs with which a 
belief coheres and, there being no such thing as an isolated belief, there is no belief without a 
presumption in its favor. (Davidson 2001, p. 153)
Bonjour’s metaprinciple does not give us any certainty that our best coherent theories are 
true or at least truth-like, it only states that coherent theories, if they remain coherent in the 
long run, are likely to be true. Conversely, it follows that false belief systems are incoherent.
The principle of metajustification is also of media-epistemological relevance. Coherence 
is suitable as a journalistic criterion of truth when information is not directly verifiable but 
merely based on testimony. In this case, the rule applies that a report is more likely to be 
true the more independent sources report on it concurrently. For the same reason it would 
3  Facticity and Truth

99
be highly improbable if several independent sources happened to report exactly the same 
story. Also in the case of testimony, lies and falsehoods are most likely to be exposed 
because of contradictions and discrepancies in the accounts. It is indeed difficult to keep a 
large body of lies consistent. Liars inevitably become entangled in contradictions at some 
point and their web of lies collapses. Coherence checks are therefore an important tool in 
fact checking to distinguish truth from fake. Fake news is likely to be embellished or exag­
gerated and, when being retold, it is often varied and altered. Serious news agencies that 
obey criteria of journalistic objectivity transmit news as truthfully as possible.
Quine has a surprising answer to the fairy tale objection and the underdetermination 
objection: both objections are justified, but they do not have a negative effect on science. 
In Quine’s view, scientific theories differ only in degree from fairy tales and fictions; they 
are merely better adapted to experience: “Epistemologically these are myths on the same 
footing with physical objects and gods, neither better nor worse except for differences in 
the degree to which they expedite our dealings with sense experiences.” (Quine 1963, 
p. 45) Also the argument that coherent theories are underdetermined doesn’t affect Quine, 
because according to him theories are underdetermined by experience, with the conse­
quence that there can be different theories that agree equally well with experience (Quine 
1963, p. 47). That is, based on the data we have no reason to prefer any of the theories. The 
theories can equally well explain the phenomena.
The underdetermination thesis follows from Quine’s holistic theory model. Quine com­
pares the knowledge system to a “man-made fabric which impinges on experience only 
along the edges” (Quine 1963, p. 42 f.). Within a theory there are propositions that are 
closer to the periphery, such as the observation sentences, and propositions that are theo­
retical in nature and more distant from the periphery. The theory network responds flexibly 
to new data. New experiences can be assimilated if they can be coherently integrated into 
the system. If, on the other hand, an anomaly occurs, i.e. a contradiction between theory 
and empirical data, the theory can be saved from contradiction by the introduction of aux­
iliary hypotheses. Only if the anomalies become more numerous and serious, then funda­
mental modifications must be made that affect the theory core. Such modifications may 
create new theories or different versions of a theory that agree equally well with the empir­
ical data. This coherence model can explain equally well both the structure and the dynam­
ics of scientific theories (cf. Zoglauer 1993, ch. 4).
Nevertheless, some questions still remain. Rescher and Bonjour define truth as corre­
spondence and consider coherence merely as a criterion of truth. Coherence provides a test 
“for judging that objective truth conditions are satisfied” (Davidson 2001, p.  137). 
Coherence is used to infer truth, “for we have reason to believe many of our beliefs cohere 
with many others, and in that case we have reason to believe many of our beliefs are true.” 
(Davidson 2001, ibid.) This still leaves one problem: The correspondence theory is based 
on a metaphysical notion of reality that is not conceptually explainable. It is therefore 
important to clarify the relationship between truth and reality.
3.5  The Coherence Theory of Truth

3.6	
Perspectival Realism
We have yet not come any closer to answering the question of what truth is. From what has 
been said so far, it should have become clear that the concept of truth is closely related to 
the concept of reality. A purely discourse-immanent definition of truth, in which different 
discourses of truth are equally valid, would lead to post-factualism. A speech community 
cannot simply stipulate truth by convention or consensus, because objective truths are sup­
posed to hold independently of human beings. In contrast, correspondence theory and 
approximation theory presuppose a metaphysical concept of truth, namely, a truth that is 
completely detached from the human subject. Accordingly, all our theories are, strictly 
speaking, false, because they are constantly being improved and thereby coming closer to 
the truth. We are thus faced with the dilemma of defining truth either internally, i.e. in 
terms of language and theory, or externally, i.e. in terms of reality.
Before we can clarify the concept of truth, we have to understand first what we mean 
by “reality”, since different concepts of reality circulate in philosophical discourses and it 
is often claimed that reality is socially constructed. Let us consider an example. Arthur 
Stanley Eddington, in the introduction to his book “The Nature of the Physical World” 
(1929), describes how he is sitting on a chair in front of his desk, picking up paper and pen 
to write the introduction to his book. He surprises the reader by claiming that there is a 
duplicate of every object. There are two tables, two chairs, and two pens. The table he sits 
in front of has a spatial extent, it has a color, a smooth surface, and it feels hard and impen­
etrable. As a physicist, however, he can describe the table in another way: The second table 
consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and besides that empty space. The thingness 
and substantiality of the first table disappear and turn out to be an illusion. The electrons 
orbiting the atomic nucleus do not possess the properties we know from ordinary bodies: 
They are colorless, indistinguishable, and cannot be precisely located in space. Strictly 
speaking, they are not particles, but quantum fields. One may therefore ask: which of the 
two tables is real? Should we trust quantum mechanics more than our sense perception? Is 
the world of appearance just an illusion? Or do our common-sense experience and physics 
provide two equally valid descriptions of reality?
Obviously, for the everyday person and for the physicist, reality is something different. 
When we talk colloquially about the world, we use ordinary language. Scientists of differ­
ent disciplines, on the other hand, use their own specialist language, in which not only 
observation terms but also theoretical terms occur, which may have a different meaning 
than observation terms in ordinary language (cf. Zoglauer 1993). In ordinary language, the 
concept of reality has a clearly defined meaning: something is real if we can perceive it 
without error. Everyday objects like tables, chairs, flowers or trees are real because we can 
see, feel and touch them. But I can still ask the question: Does the tree exist if I do not 
perceive it? And what about objects that are beyond my visual horizon, things I have never 
seen? In this case the objects are cognitively constructed by our mind. I can usually rely 
on the testimony of my friends, as well as media and scientific evidence, to be sure that a 
3  Facticity and Truth

101
particular object exists. For example, I have never seen Rio de Janeiro’s Sugarloaf 
Mountain with my own eyes, but I know it exists because I have seen pictures, reports, and 
movies of it. I also know that Mars has two moons, Deimos and Phobos, because I’ve read 
that in astronomy books. Sugarloaf and the moons of Mars are therefore real to me, even 
though I have never seen them. Reality is the result of a cognitive construction from the 
knowledge I have.
A physicist, on the other hand, has to deal with electrons, gravitational waves and black 
holes, which are not so easy to observe, but which are nevertheless assumed to exist. 
Physicists use different criteria than in everyday life to decide whether something exists. 
A physicist cannot observe electrons and other elementary particles directly, but only indi­
rectly with the help of complex devices and measuring instruments. She uses other terms 
and categories to describe reality. For her, an electron is both a particle and a wave – 
Eddington (1929, p. 201) speaks of a “wavicle”, a mixture of “wave” and “particle”. In an 
electron cloud, an electron does not occupy a precisely determined location; rather, only 
the probability to find the electron in a particular region of space can be specified. Science 
constructs a symbolic world, which Eddington calls a “shadow world”. The apparent sub­
stantiality of things dissolves and is replaced by abstract, shadowy objects such as electron 
clouds, which can only be described accurately in the language of mathematics. Reality is 
constructed theoretically in physics, albeit not arbitrarily, but in such a way that it corre­
sponds to empirical data.
We have to take into account that there are different views among physicists about what 
is real. For example, are electric fields real or are they just useful theoretical tools to 
describe electrical phenomena? For Albert Einstein, a physical quantity has a counterpart 
in reality if it is possible to predict its value with certainty without disturbing the system 
(Einstein et al. 1935). Niels Bohr (1929), on the other hand, objects that with every mea­
surement the object to be measured is influenced, which is why a deterministic description 
of the object is impossible. Accordingly, a physical quantity can be regarded as real only 
if it has been measured. Werner Heisenberg (1958, p. 54 f.) justifies this with the thesis that 
a quantum mechanical system is only in the mode of possibility and changes into the state 
of reality after a measurement. Other scientists believe they can get by without reference 
to real entities. Instrumentalism assumes that unobservable objects such as electrons, 
quarks or neutrinos are merely useful fictions postulated in order to better understand and 
explain the world.
In the everyday world there are colors, but for the physicist they are electromagnetic 
waves with different wavelengths. For us, the table seems to be continuously filled with 
matter. Physically, it consists of 99.99% empty space. Yet, we believe that both descrip­
tions are useful because they capture different aspects of the same reality. The two worlds 
are not independent, they overlap and there are transitions between the two modes of 
description. Consequently, the common-sense perspective and the physical perspective are 
not incommensurable. Niels Bohr (1929) considers the classical and quantum mechanical 
approaches as complementary to each other. The quantum mechanical formalism describes 
the behavior of a system without the influence of an observing and measuring subject. 
3.6  Perspectival Realism

102
Only when a measurement is made an interaction between subject and object occurs. By 
performing a measurement, quantum mechanical phenomena are transferred into the 
observable world and become describable in terms of classical physics.
Eddington’s example shows: We can describe what reality is only within a conceptual 
system. Nevertheless, in using different linguistic and theoretical means we still believe 
that we are describing the same world. As a consequence, we are not perceiving two dif­
ferent tables, but only one table that can be viewed from two different epistemic perspec­
tives. The perspectives just show an apparent world, behind which a mind-independent 
reality is hidden, which itself remains unknowable. Every appearance is an appearance of 
something, and Kant calls this something the thing in itself:
In fact, if we view the objects of the senses as mere appearances, as is fitting, then we thereby 
admit at the very same time that a thing in itself underlies them, although we are not acquainted 
with this thing as it may be constituted in itself, but only with its appearance, i.e., with the way 
in which our senses are affected by this unknown something. (Kant 2004, p. 66)
The concept of reality is confusing and contradictory. When we say “this tree is real”, we 
are using linguistic means to refer to an object of our sense perception. Yet, by using the 
term “tree” we are referring to something that is outside of language. “Reality” is therefore 
on the one hand language-dependent, because it can only be described by linguistic means, 
but on the other hand it points beyond language and transcends the world of appearances. 
To avoid such confusion, it makes sense to use two different terms and to distinguish 
between “reality” and “REALITY”: Reality exists only within a language or conceptual 
scheme. In contrast, REALITY, Kant’s thing in itself, is independent of any language and 
cannot be grasped conceptually. REALITY is thus something that simply exists and is not 
socially constructed. If REALITY did not exist, we would live in a world of illusion and 
appearance and would not be real ourselves.
Rudolf Carnap (1950) distinguished between internal and external questions. For 
Carnap, it is an external question whether there exists a mind-independent REALITY, 
whereas natural science can only answer internal questions about the existence of concrete 
objects. For example, if we want to know whether black holes exist, we are talking about 
objects of physics and are using a scientific language. We can describe black holes within 
the framework of general relativity. The question of the existence of black holes can be 
answered empirically. There are verification criteria that we use to decide whether a par­
ticular everyday object, such as a tree, exists. The thing world is described in a thing lan­
guage, just as the physical world is described in a physical language. But the question of 
the REALITY of the thing-world is not an internal question; it cannot be answered within 
the thing language; it is an external question because it transcends any language frame­
work and cannot be answered by empirical means. External questions are metaphysical 
questions, such as “Do uncountable sets exist?” or “Why is there anything at all and not 
rather nothing?”. In order to answer them, one would have to adopt a God standpoint, 
3  Facticity and Truth

103
which is impossible. Statements about the REALITY of the external world have no truth 
values, because there are no verification criteria for their truth.
­

Occasionally it is claimed that a mind-independent REALITY is a self-contradictory 
concept. For by thinking a REALITY, it is no longer thought-independent. The very claim 
that a mind-independent REALITY exists makes use of the ontological notion of exis­
tence. Marcus Willaschek (2015, p. 14) draws attention to the problem of “giving the 
notion of mind-independent existence any intelligible content.” The question is: how can 
we speak in language about something that lies beyond language and cannot be grasped 
conceptually? Wittgenstein says, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” 
(TLP 5.6) For Wittgenstein there are things about which we cannot speak, which point 
beyond language, and which merely “make themselves manifest” (TLP 6.522).
In a sense, it is a semantic problem. When we talk about the everyday world, we use 
colloquial language. And when a physicist talks about electrons, quarks, and quantum 
fields, he is operating within the theoretical framework of quantum theory or quantum 
field theory. Again, it makes sense to say that “electrons are real”. But in physics, “reality” 
has a different meaning than in colloquial language. Reality is therefore always relative to 
a conceptual system or epistemic perspective. The concept of REALITY is different. We 
cannot describe REALITY because we lack a suitable conceptual framework and lan­
guage for doing so. Nor can we recognize REALITY. And even if we could recognize it, 
we would not know it because we cannot compare our conception of REALITY with 
REALITY itself and determine whether it corresponds to it or not.
Nevertheless, I think that the philosophical concept of REALITY makes sense. Since 
the semantics of ordinary language and physical language cannot be used to talk about 
REALITY, we have to introduce another semantics. The solution to the problem could be 
provided by a fictionalist semantics (Predelli 2020). In fictional discourse we talk about 
fictional things that do not exist or that we do not know whether they exist. We pretend as 
if they exist. Hans Vaihinger (2021) considers Kant’s thing in itself as a fiction. He accuses 
Kant of unjustifiably applying the categories of thing, property, and causality to the thing 
in itself in order to establish a connection between the real external world and our world 
of appearances. On the other hand, we cannot help but designate something that exists 
4 Besides Rudolf Carnap, also Hans Vaihinger, William James, W.v.O. Quine and Hilary Putnam can 
be mentioned as representatives of a deflationary metaphysics.
3.6  Perspectival Realism

104
independently of us with a category, “for otherwise it is not only unthinkable but even 
inexpressible” (Vaihinger 2021, p. 69). We must assume the existence of things in them­
selves “as if they influenced us and thus gave rise to our idea of the world” (Vaihinger, 
ibid.). The existence of a mind-independent REALITY is a philosophical fiction, but a 
meaningful and indispensable fiction, without which the world would seem completely 
incomprehensible to us.
If there were not a REALITY beyond our world of experience independent of our per­
ception, the reality of a tree would consist only in its being perceived and the world would 
be an illusion. And the same holds in physics: if beyond theory and measurement won’t be 
a REALITY independent of theory, the reality of an electron would consist only in the 
measurement of its physical properties. The two tables described by Eddington would 
indeed be different, they would be two tables, if there were not a REALITY independent 
of these epistemic perspectives, so that common-sense and physics refer to the same object 
and we can speak of one table. We can therefore say: there are different realities, but only 
one REALITY.
Just as there are two realities in the case of Eddington’s two tables, there are also two 
truths: a truth in ordinary language and a physical truth. The sentence “The table has 
brown color” is true in ordinary language because the truth of the sentence can be con­
firmed by perception. Physically, however, the atoms and molecules of the table are color­
less, so the sentence is scientifically false. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a 
table, only a table-like arrangement of atoms. Truth is always relative to an epistemic 
perspective or conceptual scheme. This conflict between different truths would be prob­
lematic only if all possible perspectives and thus also the truths associated with them were 
equally valid, or if they were epistemically incommensurable. The consequence of such 
truth relativism would be post-factualism. But as we have already seen, we cannot accept 
that all perspectives are equally valid. Besides the common-sense perspective and the sci­
entific perspective, there are also less credible worldviews, such as pseudoscience, esoteri­
cism, and conspiracy theories. If we had to choose between science and pseudoscience, we 
would certainly prefer science. We will choose the epistemic perspective that has the 
greatest explanatory content, is most consistent with experiential data, has the highest 
degree of coherence, and which expands our knowledge. If we want to explore the nature 
of things and want to know, for example, what this table is made of, we cannot stop at the 
level of sense perception and everyday experience, but must examine the table 
scientifically.
I will propose perspectivism based on scientific realism as a solution to these problems. 
In philosophy this approach is known as perspectival realism, which was founded by 
Ronald Giere and Michela Massimi. Ronald Giere (2006, p. 81) argues that truth is always 
relative to a perspective. Michela Massimi (2018b, p. 347) emphasizes the perspectival 
character of scientific knowledge: “Knowledge claims in science are dependent on a given 
historically and/or intellectually situated scientific perspective.” Massimi (2018a, p. 170 f.) 
summarizes the central theses of perspectival realism (PR) as follows:
3  Facticity and Truth

105
	1.	 PR endorses the realist metaphysical tenet about a mind-independent (and perspective-­
independent) world.
	2.	 PR endorses the realist semantic tenet about a literal construal of the language of 
science.
	3.	 Finally, PR endorses the realist epistemic tenet in thinking that acceptance of a theory 
implies the belief that the theory is true (and even shares the realist intuition that truth 
has to be cashed out in terms of correspondence rather than coherence, warranted 
assertibility and so forth).
It is not clear how these theses are supposed to be compatible with each other. On the one 
hand, Massimi, like Giere, postulates a pluralism of perspectives and says that there is no 
“God’s eye view” and that knowledge is always historically and culturally relative. On the 
other hand, she advocates a correspondence theory of truth and claims that there are facts 
and truths independent of perspectives: “There are facts about water and its properties that 
are independent of scientific perspectives.” (Massimi 2018a, p. 171) Massimi justifies this 
as follows: Truth claims are always perspective-dependent, but truth itself is perspective-­
independent. Perspectives merely provide context-dependent truth conditions, which can 
be translated from one perspective to another by using transformation rules. Due to scien­
tific progress, later theories are better able to explain phenomena and assess hypotheses. 
Massimi therefore recommends more epistemic modesty: our current scientific theories 
may not be true, but from our current perspective they are the best theories available 
(Massimi 2018a, p. 173). We have to agree with Massimi on this point: If there is any 
access to truth at all, then only science can provide it.
However, Massimi’s perspectival realism struggles with the same problems as the cor­
respondence theory of truth. What can it mean that there is a perspective-independent 
truth? What are the corresponding counterparts of true statements in reality? What are the 
truth-makers? If there is no “God’s eye point of view” and if truth conditions are always 
historically contingent and only valid within a perspective, as Massimi repeatedly empha­
sizes, how can there be a perspective-independent truth at all?
Perspectival realism is therefore faced with the dilemma to decide between one of the 
following alternatives: Truth is either perspective-dependent or perspective-independent. 
A solution might be found in a compromise: Truth is context-dependent and perspective-­
immanent, but it also has a perspective-independent reference to REALITY. Scientific 
theories construct different realities that are grounded in a theory-independent 
REALITY. Without this reference to REALITY, our best scientific theories would be dan­
gling in the air disconnected from the ground and would be mere fantasy. Without “the 
world out there” there would be no error-correcting authority which could falsify our 
hypotheses and theories.
My version of perspectival realism differs from Massimi’s version in the following 
point: I reject the correspondence theory and the associated metaphysical concept of truth. 
Whether a statement is true or false can only be determined within a conceptual system. 
Any truth is only provisionally valid, since with the progress of knowledge our network of 
3.6  Perspectival Realism

106
theories and concepts is adapted to new experiences and thus the truth values of statements 
can change. With new knowledge we gain new truths and can refute old truths.
The perspectival realism presented here has much in common with Hilary Putnam’s 
internal realism. Reality, for Putnam, can only be a reality within a conceptual system. 
Different theories are based on different ontologies with their own criteria of reality. Each 
ontology with its corresponding conception of reality has its legitimacy. Objects are thus 
always theory-dependent: “In my picture, objects are theory-dependent in the sense that 
theories with incompatible ontologies can both be right.” (Putnam 1992, p. 40) Elsewhere, 
Putnam (2016) refers to Eddington’s example of the two tables and sees no contradiction 
between common-sense realism and scientific realism: both tables are equally real. A table 
can be described as hard, brown, and impenetrable as well as a quantum mechanical object 
consisting of particles and fields (see also Putnam 1983, p. 230).
However, my conception of realism differs from Putnam’s internal realism. Putnam 
refers to Peirce’s concept of truth and defines truth as ideal rational acceptability (Putnam 
1981, p. 55). For him, a statement is true if it can be justified under “epistemically ideal 
conditions”. Unfortunately, Putnam cannot explain what he means by ideal conditions: 
“Epistemically ideal conditions, of course, are like ‘frictionless planes’: we cannot really 
attain epistemically ideal conditions, or even be absolutely certain that we have come suf­
ficiently close to them.” (Putnam 1981, p. 55) Peirce (1955, p. 38) defines truth as “the 
opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate.” Like Peirce, 
Putnam (1987, p. 54) also believes that if scientists would only think long enough, they 
would finally arrive at a view that would withstand any criticism and which would then 
have to be accepted as true. In this context, Putnam mentions Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen 
Habermas, who also refer to Peirce and have arrived at the same conception of truth. Apel 
(2002, p. 133) summarizes Peirce’s argument as follows:
Truth (with regard to reality in general) is that consensus which would finally be reached in 
an infinite research community, if the research process could be continued under ideal com­
municative (i.e., related to intersubjective understanding) and epistemic (i.e., related to the 
respectively given truth criteria) conditions, that means potentially infinitely.
Habermas (1998a, p. 367) defines truth as follows: “A proposition is true if it withstands 
all attempts to refute it under the demanding conditions of rational discourse.” These defi­
nitions of truth presuppose a long list of idealizing conditions: the discourse community is 
a “community of inquirers of potentially infinite size” (Putnam 1987, p. 54), which must 
have “sufficient experience of the kind that it is actually possible for beings with our 
nature” (Putnam 1981, p. 64), meaning as much as that it must have sufficient background 
knowledge and expertise. In the words of Apel (1988, p. 429), it must be an “ideal com­
munication community”. Discourse must be “free of domination” and take place in an 
“ideal speech situation” (Habermas 1971, p. 136 ff.) and participants must have unlimited 
time at their disposal so that consensus is finally reached. It should be obvious that these 
ideal conditions can never be fulfilled in the real world. Truth thus remains an unattainable 
3  Facticity and Truth

107
distant goal. In this way a metaphysical concept of truth enters the theory through the back 
door, because it represents a fictitious ideal. The truth so defined would not be falsifiable 
and would be absolutely valid.
There is another reason why we cannot free ourselves from the perspectivity of our 
conceptual schemes by performing an infinite discourse: The human capacity for cogni­
tion is limited in principle. Putnam repeatedly reminds us that our knowledge depends on 
underlying conceptual schemes, which we cannot take off. Even if our theories converge 
towards a final truth, that truth will still be a truth within a conceptual scheme. Even asking 
the simple question “How many objects really exist?” makes no sense independent of a 
given conceptual scheme (Putnam 1987, p.  20). Other conceptual schemes lead to 
other truths.

Conceptual relativism shows that truth is always relative to an epistemic perspective. 
Nevertheless, not all perspectives are equivalent. Perspectival realism grants scientific 
theories a special status because we believe science is most capable to yield objective 
knowledge which enables us to orientate ourselves in the world. However, a skeptic might 
question the preference of scientific theories over alternative epistemic perspectives: Why 
should only scientific theories have a connection to reality and not religious belief sys­
tems, myths, or indigenous worldviews? Doesn’t perspectival realism amount to scientism, 
that means, science’s exclusive claim to truth? The term scientism is often used pejora­
tively to criticize a too narrow understanding of rationality. In the positivism dispute, rep­
resentatives of the Frankfurt School in particular have repeatedly accused 
empirical-analytical philosophy to support scientism. Jürgen Habermas defines scientism 
as “science’s belief in itself: that is, the conviction that we can no longer understand 
5 If REALITY were knowable, this would amount to idealism. Vittorio Hösle (2015, p. 40) explains 
the basic idea of objective idealism as follows: “Being must be conceived essentially intelligibly.” If 
this were so, there would no longer be an epistemic and ontological distance between mind and 
world; rather, the world itself would be spiritual in nature.

science as one form of possible knowledge, but rather must identify knowledge with sci­
ence” and accuses it of being “regressed behind the level of reflection represented by 
Kant’s philosophy” (Habermas 1972, p. 4 f.). And Adorno (1976, p. 22) takes the same 
line: “Since scientistic truth desires to be the whole truth it is not the whole truth.”

A preference for scientific forms of knowledge does not mean the delegitimization of 
other epistemic perspectives. Instead, there can be a prioritization or gradation of different 
perspectives whose value is judged according to their ability to generate knowledge. The 
evidence-based scientific method is distinguished by its capacity for error correction and 
openness to criticism. In this ability science is superior to other epistemic perspectives, as 
demonstrated by scientific and technological progress. Perspectival realism is not commit­
ted to any particular ontology, such as reductionism, materialism, or physicalism, espe­
cially since physical theories also make use of quite different ontologies, for example the 
particle ontology of Newtonian mechanics, the field ontology of quantum field theory, or 
substantivalist and relationist space-time ontologies. There are scientists and philosophers 
for whom mathematical structures are as real as rocks, stars, or black holes (Barrow 1992; 
Penrose 1989; Tegmark 2015). Rik Peels (2017b) remarks that the natural sciences rely on 
non-scientific sources of belief such as introspection, memory, intuition, and metaphysical 
principles to produce knowledge. Perspectival realism is therefore not committed to sci­
entism, because we can advocate a pluralism of perspectives and partly admit non-­scientific 
sources of knowledge and still grant science a privileged epistemic status.
Our best available scientific theories form a reference system on the basis of which 
truth claims can be decided. Science provides a picture of the universe, albeit incomplete,

10,000 years old and that humans and dinosaurs lived together before the Flood.

but one that is constantly expanding and improving. Different disciplines such as physics, 
biology, chemistry, and psychology contribute different, mutually complementary aspects 
to the overall picture. In this way a view of reality emerges, which, although changeable 
in perspective and history, nevertheless provides a successful and indispensable frame of 
reference for our thoughts and actions. But this reality is not REALITY, rather it is a theo­
retically constructed ersatz REALITY that we deal with as if it were real. The earth, moon, 
and sun are real to us. When astronomers assure us that the earth revolves around the sun, 
that proposition is true for us. We establish the truth of this proposition by comparing it 
with empirical data. The empirical data are, to use Quine’s term, part of the periphery of 
our network of theories with which we describe the world. The data are independent of us 
because we cannot influence them. But they are described in a conceptual framework pro­
vided by the theory, in this case an astronomical theory. A part of reality, namely that 
which we passively experience without being able to actively influence it, exists indepen­
dently of us, while the theoretical framework is the result of a construction process. From 
the axioms of Newtonian mechanics and Kepler’s laws it follows that the planets move in 
elliptical orbits around the Sun: This is the truth for us. Truths, however, can change. In the 
Aristotelian-Ptolemaic worldview, the Earth stood immovably in the center and the Sun 
orbited the Earth in a perfect circular path. Today we know that this is false.
As already said, science provides only an incomplete picture of the world. Many scien­
tific questions, such as whether there is life on other planets or whether the universe is 
finite or infinite, cannot be answered according to the current state of research. We do not 
know whether the sentence “There is extraterrestrial life” is true or false. At best, we can 
say that for all we know, it is very likely that extraterrestrial life exists somewhere in the 
universe. In our scientific worldview, therefore, there are “truth value gaps”: propositions 
whose truth value cannot (yet) be determined. Even if we do not know the truth value of 
such propositions, we at least know the truth criteria. When it comes to the question of the 
existence of extraterrestrial life, we know what life is and how to detect the presence of 
life. Whether or not there is life anywhere outside of Earth is fixed independently of us. It 
is part of REALITY. In the context of our biological theory, therefore, the above proposi­
tion has a definite truth value that we merely do not know. Truth-value gaps are therefore 
epistemic, not ontological.
Unlike truth value gaps, there can be no “reality gaps”. The visible universe may be 
limited, but we assume that there are galaxies, stars and planets beyond the horizon of 
observation. Although the epistemically accessible reality may be incomplete, REALITY 
definitely is not. Gaps in reality are filled ontologically and reality is thus completed. In 
this way a truth-value definiteness can be guaranteed. Truths are discovered, not invented. 
What is invented or constructed are our theories and conceptual schemes. But within this 
theoretical framework, truths are fixed independently of us.
Michael Dummett has elaborated a verification theory of truth, or a “justificationist 
theory of meaning” as he calls it. In his view, a statement can only be called true if we can 
show that it is true, that is, if the claim has been verified. And it is false if it has been falsi­
fied. But if we do not know whether it is true or false, then it has no truth value. Therefore, 
3.6  Perspectival Realism

110
according to Dummett, the proposition “There is life on Mars” is neither true nor false 
because we have not yet discovered life on Mars, on the other hand we cannot rule it out 
either. This theory of truth has drastic consequences. First, it rejects the law of the excluded 
middle: “A justificationist theory of meaning (…) cannot admit the principle of bivalence: 
for a statement we have no effective means of deciding, we have no guarantee that we shall 
arrive at a justification either of it or of its negation.” (Dummett 2010, p. 136) And second, 
this leads to the existence of reality gaps: “The resulting metaphysics is one that allows the 
existence of gaps in reality.” (Dummett 2010, ibid.) According to Dummett, the limits of 
our knowledge are the limits of our world: the world literally vanishes there. The world of 
the anti-realist is thus much smaller than the world of the realist. Therefore, it is better to 
remain a realist.
Social constructivism is right in one respect: Our theories and perspectives are socially 
constructed. Our image of reality is the result of a historical, social and cultural construc­
tion process. But it does not follow from this that all these perspectives are equally valid. 
Perspectival realism does not lead to truth relativism. For among the many different per­
spectives there are better and worse ones. Some can explain the world better than others. 
Among all perspectives, scientific theories have proven to be superior. We owe the scien­
tific-technological revolution the overwhelming success of science, which helped to 
enforce enlightenment against superstition. If we abandon the scientific path to truth, or 
believe that there are multiple truths from which we can choose at will, if we trust dema­
gogues and post-truthers more than experts, then we are following a dangerous path that 
leads finally to a post-truth society.

4.1	
Information Ecology
Let us return to the initial question I posed at the beginning of Chap 1: How can we orien­
tate ourselves in a world in which we are permanently surrounded by information of all 
kinds and how can we distinguish between true and false information? We have to select 
and evaluate information, separate the important from the unimportant, truth from fake. 
How can we gain knowledge from information?
Due to the digitization of the everyday world, we are constantly exposed to a flood of 
information that we have to channel. Information overload can cause stress and make 
decision-making more difficult (Tessier 2020). More information also means: more false, 
unreliable and misleading information, fake news and bullshit. Since we don’t always have 
the time to check information for its truthfulness and sources of information for their reli­
ability, misinformation may break through our cognitive firewall and take root in 
our memory.
I will use the term information ecology to refer to the relationship of humans to their 
information environment. Luciano Floridi (2013, p. 6) refers to the human information 
environment as the “infosphere”. This chapter will focus on distinguishing different types 
of information, which are present in the infosphere, and asking for their informational and 
truth value. We have to remind ourselves that an uncritical reception of information can 
lead to misinformation and a distorted view of reality with dangerous social and political 
consequences. Floridi compares the world created by the infosphere with the “Matrix” 
from the Hollywood movie of the same name. This is because the subjective reality is 
cognitively constructed from the information that is assimilated and processed by our 
brain. The informational construction of the world begins with sensory perception. In the 
sense organs, physical stimuli are converted into nerve impulses and transmitted to the 
brain, which interprets these signals. According to Heinz von Foerster (2003) and Gerhard

Roth (1987), our nervous system uses the “principle of undifferentiated encoding”: “The 
response of a nerve cell does not encode the physical nature of the agents that caused its 
response. Encoded is only “how much” at this point on my body, but not “what.”” (Foerster 
2003, p. 215)
This means “that the brain, instead of being open to the world, is a cognitively closed 
system that interprets and evaluates neural signals according to internal criteria. About the 
true origin and meaning of these signals it knows (absolutely) nothing” (Roth 1987, 
p. 235). Gerhard Roth puts it succinctly: “the sensually perceived world is nothing but a 
construct of our brain” (ibid.). Radical constructivism concludes from this that at the level 
of sensory stimuli there is “no representation of the world”, but only a “mosaic of elemen­
tary states of stimuli” (Roth 1992b, p. 290). The actual information about the nature of the 
stimulus can only be reconstructed at a higher cognitive level, through the accounting and 
processing of all neural signals, although it is not clear whether an already existing infor­
mation is reconstructed in the process or whether the information is thereby generated in 
the first place. According to Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela (1992, p. 164), the 
human cognitive system is operationally and thus also informationally closed. Whatever 
one may think of this constructivist thesis, it must in any case be admitted that sensory 
information at the neural level is not atomistically distributed, but has a holistic quality: 
only the totality of all neural stimuli provides us with information about the external world. 
The neural system is not endowed with a semantics. Neurons cannot understand anything, 
instead the information is generated by our brain.
What was started on the neural level continues on the social and communicative level. 
More and more digital media are interposed between us and the world, giving us access to 
the world through which we communicate, receive information and maintain social rela­
tionships. This represents an enormous expansion of our perception of the world: Through 
the Internet we are connected to the world at all times and can, in principle, access any 
information we want. The whole world is digitized and delivered to our homes.
The digitization of the everyday world is not only reflected in the use of digital informa­
tion and communication media, but also in the transformation of the concept of informa­
tion: “informatio” (Latin) originally meant an idea or the meaning of a word, but also 
instruction and teaching about its content. This colloquial meaning was replaced in the 
twentieth century by a technical concept of information. Nowadays, information is mainly 
present in digital form. Through digitization, information is decontextualized, translated 
into a sequence of zeros and ones, and transported from the sender to the receiver. It is only 
at the receiver that the message is decoded. Digitization is therefore accompanied by a 
destruction of meaning. Warren Weaver, besides Claude Shannon one of the pioneers of 
modern information theory, puts it this way: “In fact, two messages, one of which is heav­
ily loaded with meaning and the other of which is pure nonsense, can be exactly equiva­
lent, from the present viewpoint, as regards information.” (Shannon and Weaver 1963, 
p. 8) That is, you cannot tell from a digital message whether it is true or false information 
or just plain nonsense.
4  Information and Knowledge

113
Information has become a commodity and a power factor. However, information has 
first to be obtained. The knack consists in finding the desired information among the flood 
of data. Data mining uses special algorithms and statistical methods to analyze large 
amounts of data and to extract information. It is occasionally said that data is the oil of the 
twenty-first century, the raw material from which knowledge is gained. Robert Laughlin 
(2008, p. 4) supports the thesis that in the information age, “access to understanding has 
become more important, in many instances, than access to physical means.” By interpret­
ing data we gain information and from true information we gain knowledge. When talking 
about data, information and knowledge, these terms are rarely defined precisely. Often the 
terms “data” and “information” are used interchangeably. The confusion stems from the 
fact that the terms are based on different intuitions. It is therefore important to distinguish 
and differentiate between these terms.
Data are symbols that stand for things, events, persons or their properties. They are 
something like the smallest units of information, the “atoms of information”, so to say 
(Nerurkar and Gärtner 2020, p. 196). That can be instrumental readings, health data or 
information about age, gender, income and political attitudes of citizens. The data itself, 
the so-called “raw data”, are just numbers and symbols – itself meaningless unless they 
can be assigned to persons or things and thus be interpreted. Thomas Bächle (2016, p. 111) 
insists to take into account that data is not something given, but something made. From the 
standpoint of semiotics, data are signs that stand for something and were created by some­
one for a specific purpose. Only if one knows to which objects the data refer and in which 
context they stand, then they acquire meaning and only then they become information.
4.2	
Semantic Information
The concept of information is omnipresent and has become a basic concept of the digital 
age. Nevertheless, the term remains mysterious and surrounded by legends (Janich 2018). 
Even in the scientific literature, there is no unique definition to be found and everyone 
understands something different by information depending on the disciplinary context: in 
computer science, Shannon and Weaver’s (1963) technical concept of information is used, 
while in biology, a functional concept of information is more common (see Zoglauer 
1996). Philosophers prefer to speak of “semantic information”, this theory was founded by 
Rudolf Carnap and Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (1964) and further developed by Luciano 
Floridi (2011).
According to a widespread view, information is a subject-independent entity. For exam­
ple, the American philosopher Fred Dretske (1981, p. vii) describes information “as an 
objective commodity, something whose generation, transmission and reception do not 
require or in any way presuppose interpretative processes”. The English physicist Tom 
Stonier goes even further and regards information as a basic ontological structure of the 
universe:
4.2  Semantic Information

114
Information exists. It does not need to be perceived to exist. It does not need to be understood 
to exist. It requires no intelligence to interpret it. It does not have to have meaning to exist. It 
exists. (Stonier 1990, p. 21)
1
Claude Shannon was concerned with the problem of noiseless signal transmission: 
How can a message be decoded if there are distortions and interferences in the communi­
cation channel and the signal has to be filtered out from the background noise? For a given 
noise level, how much of the transmitted information reaches the receiver? To address 
these questions, Shannon first had to define the concept of information with mathematical 
precision. For an engineer it is not important to decode the meaning of a message; what is 
crucial for him is to recognize a signal as such in the first place and to distinguish it from 
statistical noise. As Shannon and Weaver (1963, p. 31) remark: “Those semantic aspects 
of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.” So the crucial question is: is 
it a signal or not? The more signals, i.e. data, are transmitted and arrive at the receiver, the 
more information the message contains. The elementary information unit, 1 bit, corre­
sponds to a yes-no answer or a binary alternative. Therefore, the technical notion of infor­
mation is not concerned with what meaning a message has, but rather with the problem of 
whether or not a signal can carry any meaning at all. A sequence of zeros and ones may 
have no meaning for us, but it can have a meaning and, for example, control a computer 
program as a machine language. Hans Christian von Baeyer (2005, p.  43  f.) explains 
Shannon’s concept of information as follows: “To find the information content of a mes­
sage, first translate this message into the binary code of the computer and count the num­
ber of digits in this sequence of zeros and ones.”
1 The philosopher Fred Dretske (1985, p. 174) expresses himself in a similar way. For him, informa­
tion exists objectively and independently of human beings: “Information, as defined above, is an 
objective commodity, the sort of thing that can be delivered to, processed by, and transmitted from 
instruments, gauges, computers, and neurons. (…) It is something that was in this world before we 
got here.”
4  Information and Knowledge

115
However, Shannon’s definition does not correspond to our common-sense understand­
ing of information. For us, only a meaningful message can have information value. The 
sentence “the sun is shining” contains information because it represents a fact, whereas the 
string “het nus si gishinn”, which was created by a simple transposition of the letters from 
the first sentence, contains no information for us because it is meaningless and has no 
representational content. Nevertheless, according to Shannon and Weaver, both sentences 
contain the same information value.
In order to remove the deficits of Shannon’s concept of information and to restore our 
ordinary understanding of information, Carnap and Bar-Hillel (1964) introduced the con­
cept of semantic information (cf. Zoglauer 1995, 1996). Put simply, it is a measure of the 
meaning content of a message. While Shannon and Weaver ascribe an information value 
also to single signs, Carnap and Bar-Hillel allow only meaningful statements as informa­
tion carriers. The more a sentence tells, the more information it contains. For example, the 
sentence “Today the sun is shining and it is raining” contains more information than the 
sentence “Today it is raining” and the latter in turn contains more information than the 
sentence “Today the sun is shining or it is raining”. And the sentence “All men are mortal” 
has a higher information value than the sentence “Mr. Smith is mortal”, because the sec­
ond sentence is a conclusion from the first.
The semantic information theory of Carnap and Bar-Hillel, however, has a paradoxical 
consequence: tautologies like the law of non-contradiction say nothing about reality and 
thus contain no information. And what is perhaps even more perplexing: contradictions, 
i.e. propositions of the form “p and not-p”, have the highest information value. This is 
called the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. To rule out this paradoxical consequence, Floridi 
(2011) modified the semantic notion of information. According to Floridi, an information-­
containing sentence must not only be meaningful, but also true. This requirement is called 
“veridicality thesis”. False information would therefore not be semantic information 
according to Floridi. For him, the formula is: Information = Data + Meaning + Truth. 
Information is what a sentence tells about the world. Floridi bases his theory of semantic 
information on Wittgenstein’s picture theory of language: true sentences are images of 
reality (TLP 2.222, 2.223). But since only those sentences contain information that tell 
something about reality, only true sentences can be informative. False propositions say 
nothing about reality. Dretske (2008, p. 276) takes a similar view: “Not only must informa­
tion be about something, what it says about what it is about must be true for it to count as 
information. If it isn’t true, it isn’t information.”
Unfortunately, this view does not take into account the pragmatic dimension of lan­
guage. Information is always context-dependent and is constituted by the recipient’s inter­
pretation of the data. Information is thus not a natural object that can be transported from 
sender to receiver. Information does not exist in the world, it cannot be naturalized, but 
requires consciousness in order to be interpreted (Zoglauer 1996). I would like to illustrate 
this with an example. When a mother says to her eight-year-old son, “Daniel, clean up 
your room!” a lot of information is communicated by this sentence, namely that the room 
is untidy, that the mother wants her son to clean up the room, that Daniel is neglecting his 
4.2  Semantic Information

116
duties, and that his negligence will have educational consequences. Daniel will know from 
the tone of his mother’s admonition that she is very upset and will conclude that he will be 
confined in his room if he does not clean up. Even a silence can carry information, as 
Romele (2020, p. 29) demonstrates with an example: if a man asks his wife a question and 
the wife does not respond, this can mean that she did not hear the question or that she is 
upset and refuses to answer. All this information can be inferred from the specific context 
of action in which the utterance is made.
Just as texts can contain a hidden message, a subtext, also information can contain sub­
information. When Donald Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 
6, 2021, to express their displeasure about the allegedly rigged presidential election, they 
took this, in the context of the heated atmosphere, as an encouragement to storm the 
Capitol and turn violent. These examples show that questions, commands, and even a 
silence can contain semantic information even though they have no descriptive content. 
The informative content can vary depending on the situation and the articulation of the 
speech act. The manner of an utterance, even if false, can provide information about the 
speaker. For example, Trump’s numerous lies reveal a great deal about his state of mind. 
Lies thus also have informational value. Floridi’s veridicality thesis is therefore untenable.
Suppose a thief breaks into a jewelry store, is caught by the store owner, and as a result, 
the burglar shoots the manager. Hoping to get off with a lighter sentence, he admits to the 
burglary in court but denies murder. He says, “I broke into the store, but I didn’t shoot the 
store manager.” According to the correspondence theory, this statement is false, because 
he has already been convicted of murder. Therefore, under Floridi’s theory, the statement 
contains no information. Nevertheless, the defendant provides an important piece of infor­
mation: namely, he admits that he committed the burglary. Formally, the statement repre­
sents a conjunction of a true and a false proposition. If one conjunct is false, the whole 
sentence becomes false. Therefore, one cannot conclude from the falsity of the statement 
that it does not contain a true proposition and thus information.
Some sentences, which were once believed to be true, may later turn out to be false. In 
the past, people believed that the earth was flat. For many people, this represented an 
important information about the shape of the earth. Today we know that the sentence is 
false. But for us contemporaries it also contains information about the worldview of 
ancient times. Lundgren (2019, p. 2893) cites Newtonian mechanics as another example 
that contradicts the veridicality thesis:
Proponents of the veridicality thesis would have to say that Einstein showed that Newton’s 
mechanics is not semantic information. But it is much more reasonable to think that we can 
classify Newton’s mechanics as semantic information and add that it is false.
Weather forecasts are another example (Lundgren, ibid.). Weather forecasts have a proba­
bilistic character. For example, it is said that the probability of rain tomorrow will be 90%. 
This information causes many people to take their umbrellas with them the next day. 
Semantic information evokes an effect in the recipient: it may be a change in behavior, as 
4  Information and Knowledge

117
in the weather forecast example, or simply the fact that the listener gains a conviction or 
believes something. And even if it doesn’t rain tomorrow, that doesn’t erase the informa­
tion or make it worthless. Probabilities say something about possibilities or tendencies, but 
nothing about reality. According to Floridi, they should therefore contain no information, 
which seems counterintuitive. As we have seen, statements about possibilities or tenden­
cies do indeed have an information value.
Dretske (2008, p. 280) believes that information can be sent like a letter: “Write down 
what you mean, put it (what you’ve written) in a stamped envelope, deposit it in the mail­
box, and – bingo! – meaning gets from Chicago to Vienna in a few short days.” Dretske 
speaks of an “information flow,” as the title of his book (1981) indicates, because he thinks 
that information can “flow” from sender to receiver. According to this view, the meaning 
of the message is coded in its material carrier: “meaning goes with the ink marks” (Dretske 
2008, ibid.). This does not take into account that meaning only exists if there is an inter­
preter who can read and understand the message. Without interpreters, the information 
would be lost and the letter would only contain ink blots without meaning. A transmission 
of information only succeeds if the sender and receiver interpret the data in the same way. 
The following example shows how such a transmission can go wrong: Suppose Barbara 
wants to do some workout. Therefore she calls a fitness center and says, “I want to hire a 
coach.” Unfortunately, she dials the wrong phone number and ends up with a bus rental 
service. The information is transmitted correctly, but misunderstood by the recipient. As a 
result, Barbara can now enhance her fitness by bus driving.
In order for an information to “flow” from A to B, the transmission of information must 
be transitive, i.e. it must be possible to copy it repeatedly. Dretske (1985, p. 173) calls this 
the “xerox principle”: If A contains information B and B contains information C, then A 
also contains information C. Dretske explains this with an example:
If the acoustic pattern reaching my ears carries the information that the doorbell is ringing, 
and the ringing of the bell carries the information that the doorbell button is being pressed, 
then the acoustic pattern also carries the information that the doorbell button is being pressed 
(xerox principle). (Dretske 1985, p. 175)
The transitivity of information transfer can be easily refuted by a counterexample. Suppose 
someone claims:
	1.	 Everything in this book is wrong.
The sentence (1) is in this book. Therefore it contains the information
	2.	 The sentence (1) is wrong.
If sentence (1) is false, then it follows from (2):
	3.	 Not everything in this book is wrong.
(1) and (3) contradict each other, so the sentence (1) cannot contain the information (3). 
Therefore, the xerox principle is wrong.
4.2  Semantic Information

118
The notion of information transfer from sender to receiver is, as Jakob Krebs (2014) 
shows, misleading. Information has a relational character and is not a substance that can 
be transported from A to B. If the context changes, the information also changes.
4.3	
Misinformation and Disinformation
Of the millions of bits of information that reach us every day, most of it turns out to be 
unimportant or useless. We receive spam, are bombarded with advertising on all channels, 
and we hear and read all kinds of rumors, gossip, and tittle-tattle. The Internet invites 
people to spread false information in order to manipulate others. One can speak of a down­
right “information pollution”. Stanislaw Lem therefore considers it extremely important to 
recognize and evaluate the informational value of incoming stimuli: “A necessary prereq­
uisite for not “drowning” in the swelling flood of information is to recognize the quality of 
the information, not to take note of unimportant information, advertising, trivialities, and 
nullities.” (Lem 2002, p. 275 f.) It is important to distinguish true from false news and to 
correctly assess the reliability, credibility, accuracy, relevance and objectivity of informa­
tion. Information quality depends on the trustworthiness of the source, the type of infor­
mation, but also on the information channel. This is because the quality can decrease on 
the way from the sender to the receiver due to incorrect forwarding. One might think of the 
game “Chinese whispers”, popular among children, in which a message arrives at the 
recipient garbled, disfigured, and distorted after a long chain of transmission.
If one assumes, as Floridi and Dretske do, that information is always true, there should 
actually be no misinformation or disinformation (Floridi 2011, p. 93 ff.; Dretske 2008, 
p. 276 ff.). Misinformation is information that is false. There is a whole continuum of 
intermediate values between truth and falsity, which makes it difficult to clearly distin­
guish true information from false information. For example, are exaggerations, embellish­
ments, or compliments misrepresentations? Is bullshit or inaccurate representation a form 
of misinformation? Bullshit in the sense of prattle, waffle, or drivel (Dietz 2017, p. 51) is 
not necessarily false. Rather, it is information without informational value. The expecta­
tion of accuracy of a statement depends on the context and purpose of the information. If 
the physics teacher asks a student what the speed of light is, she will be satisfied with the 
answer “300,000 km/s”. But for astronomical calculations, a more precise number is 
needed: 299,792.45 km/s. Therefore, it is important to distinguish information not only in 
terms of its truth content, but also in terms of its information quality.
When false information is disseminated with the intent to deceive, it is called disinfor­
mation. Don Fallis (2014, p. 137; 2016, p. 333) defines disinformation as intentionally 
misleading information. Fake news therefore represents a special form of disinformation 
because it has the characteristics of misleading and intent to deceive. In contrast, 
Zimmermann and Kohring (2020) do not regard the intention to deceive as a necessary 
criterion for disinformation. They justify this with the examples of clickbaiting and misin­
formation intentionally incorporated into Wikipedia articles to test whether these errors 
4  Information and Knowledge

are noticed and corrected. Clickbaiting is the use of sensational headlines in Internet arti­
cles to attract attention and curiosity, thus driving up traffic and advertising revenue. 
However, the examples mentioned by Zimmermann and Kohring are not convincing, as 
the clickbaits are set with the intention of creating false expectations in the reader. It is 
irrelevant whether the information is believed by the readers or not. The intentional mis­
leading as such implies an intent to deceive because the readers are not getting what they 
expect. Similarly, in the case of intentionally manipulated Wikipedia articles, it is irrele­
vant whether the misinformation is believed by Wikipedians or not. They are pretending 
something that is not true. Thus, there is an intent to deceive.
As we have seen, information is neither true nor false in itself, but is interpreted as true 
or false. If it is misinterpreted, it is misinformation. Conspiracy theorists in particular tend 
to misinterpret information. Let me illustrate this with an example. When Neil Armstrong 
became the first man to walk on the moon on July 21, 1969, the event could be seen live 
on television screens around the world. The blurry black and white images were of poor 
quality compared to today’s high definition television images. From a technical point of 
view, the images had little information value. You could see Armstrong as a black shadow 
descending the barely discernible ladder of the lunar module and setting his foot on a 
bright surface that must have been the “Mare Tranquillitatis.” In the context of news 
reporting, a particular interpretation of the images is given: Neil Armstrong makes the first 
step on the lunar surface. Conspiracy theorists, however, interpret the images differently: 
an actor descends the model of a lunar module in a Hollywood studio and touches the 
studio floor covered with sand and stones with his foot. The information content of the 
images allows for both interpretations. How one interprets the television images – whether 
as a live broadcast from the moon or as a Hollywood production – depends on the framing. 
A conspiracy theorist believes that the USA has always been involved in plots and con­
spiracies and thinks that the government and the media deceive the citizens also in the case 
of the moon landing. For conspiracy believers, the media reports are part of a gigantic 
disinformation campaign.
We can consider the television image of the first step of a man on the moon as an 
ambiguous figure: If you trust the media, it is a document of the first moon landing. If, on 
the other hand, one assumes a conspiracy, it is a fake. Only by contextualizing the per­
ceived image in one’s own worldview and in the background context the information 
becomes a proposition that can be true or false. If one does not confine oneself to the 
shadowy television images, but also takes into account the films, photographs, and rock 
samples that the astronauts brought from the moon to earth, as well as the testimonies of 
NASA engineers and the scientists who examined the moon rocks, one must conclude that 
the television images were authentic and that the moon landing actually took place. 
Information then becomes knowledge.

Knowledge always has a subjective and an objective component. The subjective com­
ponent represents the attitude of the subject towards the propositional object of knowl­
edge: I can believe that p is true, I can be convinced that p is true, or I can be certain that 
p is true. The objective component is the content of the belief, that is, the proposition p 
itself. The proposition can be true or false. Whether it is true or false does not depend on 
the subject, but is objectively fixed.
To know something, I must be able to give reasons for the truth of the proposition p. I 
must be able to justify p. With this requirement an accidentally true belief is ruled out. For 
example, I can guess in a dice game that I will roll a six next. As it happens, a six does 
indeed appear. But I can’t claim that I knew it, because I had no grounds for my belief. 
Consider another case: “I know that a total solar eclipse occurred in Germany on August 
11, 1999.” I can justify this knowledge either by my perception, because I was an eyewit­
ness to this event, or I can retrodict the event by using the laws of celestial mechanics and 
calculating when the solar eclipse did happen, or I can refer to testimonies and television 
reports and other media accounts documenting the event. Once I have come to the reason­
able conclusion that proposition p is true, I can add it to my corpus of knowledge.
Knowledge involves three things: a belief, a justification, and the truth of the proposi­
tion. It is these three elements that make up the classical definition of knowledge: 
Knowledge is a true justified belief. S knows that p if and only if (i) p is true, (ii) S believes 
that p, and (iii) S is justified in believing that p. This definition contains all the important 
2 In addition to propositional “knowing-that”, there is also a “knowing-how” or implicit knowledge 
that describes practical skills. However, such non-propositional forms of knowledge will not be 
examined here.

aspects of knowledge. However, Edmund Gettier (1963) raised objections to this defini­
tion, which led to a long-lasting controversy about the necessary and sufficient conditions 
of knowledge. His counterexamples satisfy all three requirements for knowledge – truth, 
belief, and justification – but cannot be called knowledge. The examples are constructed in 
such a way that someone has a true, justified belief that p, but p just happens to be true. Let 
me illustrate this with an example that doesn’t go back to Gettier, but was devised by Alvin 
Goldman (1976).
Henry makes a car ride with his son and they come to an area where there are barns on 
the left and right side of the road. His son points to one of the barns, which stands out 
because of its striking red color, and asks, “Dad, what’s that?” His father replies, “That’s 
a barn.” Let’s assume that Henry is right. Because the object does indeed look like a barn, 
he is justified in his belief. What Henry and his son don’t know, is that they are currently 
driving through a Potemkin village where sets have been built for a film production. All 
the barns, except one, are dummies. Coincidentally, his son pointed to the only real barn. 
So Henry had a true, justified belief. Still, we wouldn’t call this knowledge. Henry was just 
lucky with his guess.

Common-sense knowledge and scientific knowledge are judged by different standards. 
To use Eddington’s table example: I know that the table I am sitting in front of is brown, 
although at the same time I know that the atoms that make up the table have no color. The 
two statements seem to contradict each other: Either the table has a color or it has no color, 
but it cannot be both the case. The contradiction resolves when we consider that we are 
speaking of the table in different contexts. In the first case I consider the table as an every­
day object and use colloquial language, while in the second case I speak of the table as a 
physical object in a scientific context. A layperson and an expert may well come to differ­
ent conclusions. We can either claim that these are two different concepts of knowledge or 
that there are different degrees of knowledge and that expert knowledge is an extension of 
common-sense knowledge. Physical knowledge is founded on common-sense knowledge 
and refines it. Therefore, epistemic contextualism does not lead to relativism. Everyday 
life and science merely apply different standards or requirements to knowledge. Peter 
Baumann (2015, p. 79) takes it for granted that the standards for knowledge in one context 
can be lower or higher than in another context: “Thus, one has to know the context in order 
3 On epistemic contextualism, see: Baumann (2016), Ichikawa (2017).

to judge whether a person knows that this or that is the case or not. Knowledge varies with 
and depends on context.” As Michael Blome-Tillmann (2019, p. 177) puts it, “Epistemic 
contextualism is, as a consequence, a linguistic or semantic view – namely, the view that 
the truth-values of ‘knowledge’-ascriptions – sentences of the form ‘x knows p’ – may 
vary with the context of utterance.”
4.5	
Degrees of Knowledge
Fake news and conspiracy theories are regarded as categorically different from scientific 
knowledge. However, it is not taken into account that there are different degrees of knowl­
edge and that fluid transitions from established knowledge to mere conjecture and igno­
rance are possible. For the reception of information it is therefore important to distinguish 
between different qualities of information and knowledge.
In epistemology, it is generally assumed that knowledge does not admit of degrees. We 
may be convinced of something to a higher or lower degree, but we would not normally 
claim “that someone knows something to a higher (or lower) degree than another”, as Elke 
Brendel (2013, p. 121) writes. In contrast to this orthodox view, I want to argue for a 
knowledge gradualism according to which there are degrees of knowledge and it makes a 
difference whether someone knows something for sure or whether it is merely a well-­
grounded guess.
The orthodox view is based on the law of the excluded middle, according to which a 
proposition is either true or false, but there are no other truth values between true and false. 
If knowledge is defined as “true justified belief”, a belief can be either true or false, and 
hence there can only be knowledge or non-knowledge, but nothing in between. This does 
not take into account that justifications may well admit degrees: An opinion can be well or 
badly justified, well or badly empirically confirmed, and therefore we can know something 
more or less.
Norman Malcolm (1963) was one of the first to distinguish between knowledge in the 
strong sense and knowledge in the weak sense. Knowledge in the strong sense is when I 
am sure that I know something. If I am not sure, if I know something only in the weak 
sense, then I check it and make further investigations in order to be completely sure:
When I use “know” in the weak sense I am prepared to let an investigation (demonstration, 
calculation) determine whether the something that I claim to know is true or false. When I use 
“know” in the strong sense I am not prepared to look upon anything as an investigation; I do 
not concede that anything whatsoever could prove me mistaken; I do not regard the matter as 
open to any question; I do not admit that my proposition could turn out to be false, that any 
future investigation could refute it or cast doubt on it. (Malcolm 1963, p. 64)
Malcolm explains this with an example (ibid., p. 62 ff.): Suppose I want to calculate 92 × 
16 and arrive at the result 1472. If I am asked, “Are you sure?”, I reply, “I am pretty sure. 
But since I’m not that good at mental arithmetic, I want to do the math again.” So I know 
4  Information and Knowledge

123
it only in a weak sense. On the other hand, when I’m asked, “How much is 2 + 2?”, I say, 
“4” without hesitation, and I can spare myself the recalculation, because I am absolutely 
sure that the result is correct. In this case, I know it in the strong sense.
Now, one could object to Malcolm that his distinction and his examples only concern 
the degree of a belief, but not the content of a belief. Gerhard Ernst (2010, p. 61 f.) distin­
guishes two dimensions of a belief: its strength and its content. In Malcolm’s example, the 
proposition “92 × 16 = 1472” is the content or object of the belief. The belief may be 
strong or weak, certain or uncertain; in any case, it characterizes the subjective attitude of 
the knower toward the proposition. The content of the belief, on the other hand, admits of 
no degrees. The law of the excluded middle asserts: either 92 × 16 = 1472 or 92 × 16 ≠ 1472. 
If the calculation is correct, then the result is objectively correct, whether one is convinced 
of it or not. Therefore, if one wants to defend knowledge gradualism, one has to show that 
not only the strength of one’s belief but also its content allows for quantitative differences. 
And indeed, one can know more or less, one can have a rich detailed knowledge or possess 
only a superficial knowledge.
Stephen Hetherington (2005, 2011) differentiates between different degrees of knowl­
edge or depth of knowledge and explains this with an example (Hetherington 2011, 
p. 170): Suppose I see a bird sitting in my garden and realize that it is a goldfinch. I recog­
nize it by its black, white, and red head and its call, which sounds like “didlit.” By these 
characteristics I can distinguish it from other species of birds. I can therefore confidently 
claim, “I know that this is a goldfinch,” even though I am not a bird expert. An ornitholo­
gist knows birds better than I do and will additionally be able to identify the goldfinch 
(carduelis carduelis) by its wings, flight, breeding behavior, and feeding habits, and there­
fore be able to assert with greater certainty that it is a goldfinch. A molecular biologist can 
identify the bird according to its genetic code and can derive the phylogenetic tree of this 
species from it. That means, the more characteristics or typical aspects of an object I know, 
the more I know about that object. It is not just subjective belief, but the larger background 
and contextual knowledge that leads to a deepening of knowledge. I can be mistaken as a 
layperson and mistake the goldfinch for a chaffinch, but an expert knows more about birds 
than I do and can judge more accurately.
Assertions can be more or less credible, well or less confirmed, hypothetical or specula­
tive. The quality of knowledge depends, among other things, on the degree of confirma­
tion. The better a hypothesis is empirically confirmed, the more convincing it is. Consider, 
for example, the proposition “All swans are white”. The more white swans I have observed, 
the better the hypothesis is confirmed. However, it can also happen that I observe a black 
swan and my hypothesis is thereby falsified. My knowledge about swans thus turns out to 
be wrong. But one can also say: My knowledge about swans is expanded. I learn that there 
are different species of swans, of which mute swans (cygnus olor) have white plumage, 
while black swans (cygnus atratus) are black. I therefore modify my original hypothesis 
and know now that “All swans of the species cygnus olor are white” and “All swans of the 
species cygnus atratus are black”. In this way my knowledge is refined and deepened.
4.5  Degrees of Knowledge

124
We hold knowledge to be absolute because we believe that a true proposition is a faith­
ful representation of reality. But as we have seen, knowledge always represents only a 
perspectival model of the world and can never represent the world as it is in itself. A model 
can be more or less adequate, which is why truth also admits of gradations and degrees. 
The degree of truth is an inner-theoretical criterion of the reliability of an assertion or a 
model, but it cannot indicate how “close” it is to reality. Just as there is a continuum 
between truth and falsity, there are also degrees of knowing and not knowing, ranging 
from established scientific theories to pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.
4.6	
Second-Hand Knowledge
People who believe in fake news or conspiracy theories or doubt accepted scientific theo­
ries, get their knowledge second-hand, e.g. from dubious internet sources. They use social 
media and believe rumors or trust what their friends and like-minded people say. 
Information p is transmitted from a source A to a receiver B according to the principle: A 
believes that p, B trusts A and therefore also believes that p. There is no independent veri­
fication of the truth of p. Such information transfer can go well if p is true, A has good 
reasons for p, and thus B also acquires a knowledge of p. But a knowledge transfer can 
also fail, e.g. if B falls victim to a mistaken belief. In the following we will investigate 
under which conditions a knowledge transmission can succeed and the receiver B actually 
acquires a knowledge of p.
Knowledge from hearsay is indirect knowledge and is therefore more prone to error 
than direct knowledge. We acquire direct knowledge through perception, or the truth of an 
assertion, e.g. a mathematical theorem, is immediately obvious or provable a priori. 
Perceptual knowledge is non-inferential knowledge because it is given directly and does 
not have to be inferred from other knowledge. Inferences can be deductive or inductive, 
that is, information-preserving or information-expanding. Inductive inferences are there­
fore more prone to error because they are based on presumptive knowledge. Leaving aside 
the a priori truths of logic and mathematics, we can gain direct empirical knowledge only 
by perceiving our immediate environment and drawing conclusions from it. Everything 
else we learn from the reports of others or infer it inductively. Children learn from their 
parents or acquire their knowledge from teachers. We obtain much of our knowledge from 
the media: books, newspapers, radio, television, the Internet. All this knowledge is second-­
hand knowledge.
David Hume regards such indirect knowledge with suspicion and attributes to people a 
credulity towards the reports of others. He notes “a remarkable propensity to believe what­
ever is reported, even concerning apparitions, enchantments, and prodigies, however con­
trary to daily experience and observation” (Hume 1978, p.  113). In this way, he is 
addressing a phenomenon known today as “fake news” that spread in the eighteenth cen­
tury in the form of superstition and belief in miracles. The question therefore arises: How 
trustworthy and reliable is second-hand knowledge?
4  Information and Knowledge

125
The optimists among the epistemologists tend to grant a high degree of trust in the reports 
of others. Thomas Reid (1818, p. 353 f.) refers to God and believes that he has endowed 
people with a love of truth and trust in the testimony of others, so that we may believe their 
reports. Tyler Burge assumes, similar to Reid, that we may accept other people’s accounts as 
true unless there are opposing reasons not to do so. Burge (2013, pp. 237, 265) calls this the 
acceptance principle: “A person is entitled to accept as true something that is presented as 
true and that is intelligible to him, unless there are stronger reasons not to do so.” Burge justi­
fies this by saying that in social interaction with other people we have to regard them as ratio­
nal beings, because this is for him a necessary presupposition of communication. And he adds 
that rationality implies truthfulness. Therefore we can trust other people.
I think this view is naive. It means that we have to accept fake news and conspiracy 
theories as true, as long as there are no opposing reasons. Fake news spreads so quickly 
and unstoppably precisely because many people adhere to the acceptance principle and 
trust the reports of others without question. In the worldview of Trump supporters, there is 
no reason to distrust his tweets because they all seem true. Those who believe that the 
results of the 2020 presidential election were rigged don’t think that there is any need for 
proof of that. Rather, it would be up to Biden supporters to make sure that there was no 
fraud. The acceptance principle basically calls for a reversal of the burden of proof: it is 
not the conspiracy theorists who would have to justify their claims, but rather one is 
allowed to believe in them as long as there are no reasons against the existence of a con­
spiracy. But conspiracies, unfortunately, cannot be falsified.
In order for the recipients of a message to know something, stronger criteria than 
Burge’s acceptance condition must be met. A resonable conjecture seems to be the follow­
ing transmission principle:
	(A)	 If A knows that p and A tells B that p, then B also knows that p.
Let’s consider the following example: Albert knows that Christine is in New York. Christine 
has sent him selfies with the Statue of Liberty in the background. Albert therefore has good 
reasons to believe that Christine is in New York. Albert tells Bennie that Christine is in 
New York and Bennie will believe him. Albert and Bennie are good friends. Albert has never 
lied to Bennie. Therefore, Bennie trusts his friend. Trust is obviously an important prerequi­
site for successful knowledge transfer. John Hardwig (1991) considers trust to be a more 
fundamental source of knowledge than empirical data or logical arguments. Therefore, we 
can modify the transmission principle (A) as follows:
	(B)	 If A knows that p and A tells B that p, and B trusts A, then B knows that p.
What is the basis of Bennie’s trust that Albert is telling the truth? Albert has not shown 
Bennie the photos of Christine. The trust is based solely on Albert’s testimony and his 
behavior in the past: so far, Albert has always told the truth. From this, Bennie concludes 
that Albert has a trustworthy character. Trust thus becomes a matter of character. Hardwig 
(1991, p. 702) regards this to be the basis of the knowledge we receive from others: “I have 
4.6  Second-Hand Knowledge

126
claimed that trust in the testimony of others is necessary to ground much of our knowl­
edge, and that this trust involves trust in the character of the testifier.” However, Hardwig 
here confuses trust with justification: in order to obtain knowledge, a belief must be justi­
fied. Justification requires good reasons. Trust in the character of others is not sufficient for 
this. Trust is a subjective psychological attitude, whereas reasons have the form of objec­
tive rational arguments.

As we have already seen, there are different degrees of knowledge. If Barbara has read 
about Fermat’s theorem on the Internet, this is a form of knowledge. But Barbara is not an 
expert in the field of number theory. Mathematicians know more about that. Not every 
mathematician is able to follow the complicated proof of p in all its details. Few experts 
have a complete overview of all the steps in the proof. Andrew undoubtedly has a complete 
knowledge of p. Barbara’s knowledge is limited. She does not know all the reasons Andrew 
has for p. But she does possess a meta-knowledge about Andrew: she knows that Andrew 
is a recognized expert in the field of mathematics, that his proof has been thoroughly peer-
reviewed by other experts, has appeared in a prestigious journal, and has become widely 
accepted. Because of this meta-­knowledge, she can trust Andrew. We can therefore modify 
the transmission principle as follows:
	(C)	 If A knows that p and A tells B that p and B has meta-knowledge about A that justifies 
B’s trust in A, then B also knows that p.
The example of Andrew and Barbara shows how knowledge is weakened as it is trans­
ferred from A to B. The attenuation can have the following reasons: B does not possess a 
complete background knowledge of A; B does not know all the reasons why A is con­
vinced of p; B lacks the necessary understanding of p; or B does not trust A, or B does not 
have complete meta-knowledge of A. The loss of knowledge is especially noticeable when 
4 Fermat’s conjecture was proved in 1994 by Andrew Wiles in collaboration with Richard Taylor. 
The proof is 98 pages long.
4  Information and Knowledge

127
knowledge is transferred through a long chain of many people. In this case not only the 
knowledge about p, but also the meta-knowledge of A must be transferred from the mes­
sengers to the subsequent recipients. If this meta-­knowledge is missing, the knowledge 
source is not trustworthy.
We have found that the quality of knowledge deteriorates through transmission. I would 
like to call this the principle of diminishing knowledge: If no new information or new 
reasons or evidence are added along the transmission path, then the quality of knowledge 
deteriorates. But can transmission also generate new knowledge? Jennifer Lackey (1999, 
p. 473) claims that the receiver B can gain knowledge of p even if the sender has no knowl­
edge of p. She states: “I shall claim that there are some plausible ways in which a hearer 
can acquire knowledge that p via a speaker’s testimony that p despite the fact that even the 
first speaker in the chain in question fails to know that p.” Lackey justifies her thesis with 
the following example (Lackey 1999, p. 477): Mrs. Smith is a biology teacher who teaches 
at a Catholic school. The curriculum includes Darwin’s theory of evolution. However, 
Mrs. Smith is a devout creationist and does not believe in evolutionary theory. Nevertheless, 
she must teach her students what is required by the curriculum. Therefore, she goes to the 
library, reads books about the theory of evolution, and teaches her students the necessary 
knowledge. She doesn’t show that she thinks Darwin’s teaching is blasphemous nonsense, 
but diligently follows the textbooks she has read. The students now know all about the 
theory of evolution. But Mrs. Smith has no knowledge of evolutionary theory because she 
does not believe in it, and belief is in fact a necessary condition for knowledge. How can 
a knowledge be transmitted if the sender (Mrs. Smith) does not possess the knowledge? 
Doesn’t this contradict the principle of diminishing knowledge?
Let’s consider where the students’ knowledge comes from. Mrs. Smith is ruled out as a 
source of knowledge. Let us analyze the case from the viewpoint of information transmis­
sion. The students receive the information about the theory of evolution from Mrs. Smith. 
Mrs. Smith obtained the information from textbooks and passed it on to her students 
unchanged. The information from the textbooks came from other scientific sources and 
ultimately go back to Charles Darwin, the founder of the theory of evolution. Of Darwin 
we can rightly say: he possessed a sound knowledge of the theory of evolution, he was 
convinced of it, and he had good reasons and empirical evidence for its correctness. 
Darwin is thus the real source of the students’ knowledge, the “first speaker” in the trans­
mission chain, so to say. Mrs. Smith merely acts as a transmitter of information. She could 
have teached the subject by simply reading it to her students word by word from a text­
book. Mrs. Smith could have been replaced with a robot that read the material just as she 
did. Or the students could have extracted their knowledge from the Internet. Mrs. Smith is 
just a passive messenger – like a mailwoman or like a phone line. Let us assume for a 
moment that the lesson is only intended to impart knowledge of the history of science, and 
that the students are instructed to know what Darwin wrote in his book “On the Origin of 
Species,” then this knowledge is transmitted from Darwin to the students via many inter­
mediate steps and Mrs. Smith is one link in this transmission chain. No new knowledge is 
added along the way. On the contrary, the students cannot know everything that Darwin 
knew. Therefore, the principle of diminishing knowledge holds here as well.
4.6  Second-Hand Knowledge

128
One can doubt that in the case of Mrs. Smith the students really acquire a knowledge 
from her. This is because the students do not have a complete meta-knowledge of their 
teacher. If the students knew that she was a staunch creationist, they would not trust her. 
Consequently, the conditions for the transmission principle (C) are not met and the stu­
dents do not possess a reliable knowledge of evolutionary theory. This consideration 
shows the importance of background knowledge and context in assessing the quality of 
knowledge. The students believe they have a solid knowledge of evolutionary theory. 
However, Lackey’s story provides a different view: Mrs. Smith is in fact not a reliable and 
unbiased teacher. If she rejects the theory of evolution outside of class, she cannot simply 
put her beliefs aside in class and appear as a convinced Darwinist. The students’ knowl­
edge is thus compromised and impaired. The problem also has a political dimension: 
should devout creationists be allowed to teach biology in schools? Or can we trust doctors 
who have appeared as Covid deniers or who are active in the anti-vaccination movement?
Edward Craig (1993) adds the notion of a “good informant” to the classical definition 
of knowledge as true justified belief: Knowledge must come from a reliable source of 
information about which we know, or at least can assume with a high degree of probability, 
that it is not lying to us. Craig tightens his requirement with the additional condition that 
the good informant not only has to tell the truth factually, but also tell the truth in other 
possible worlds similar to our world and the factual situation (Craig 1993, p. 69). Consider 
again the example of Mrs. Smith and her students. Mrs. Smith tells her students the truth 
about the theory of evolution. She seems to be a good informant. But now let’s change the 
initial situation a bit and suppose that Mrs. Smith is annoyed about the headmaster, who 
thinks that she is an untrustworthy teacher because she polemicizes on blogs and social 
media against evolutionary theory and defends creationism. In her anger, she drops her 
restraint and openly tells the students that she thinks the theory of evolution is wrong 
because it contradicts the creation story. In this case, she is not a good informant. But since 
this hypothetical case is similar to the situation Lackey describes and could occur at any 
time, Mrs. Smith cannot be considered trustworthy even if she strictly adheres to the cur­
riculum. To put it in other words: Mrs. Smith is a weak link in the chain of knowledge 
transmission. The students’ biology books are good informants, as are the textbooks Mrs. 
Smith has read in preparation for her classes. But she remains trapped in her religious 
worldview and offers no guarantee for reliably conveying the subject to her students in an 
unbiased manner. Mrs. Smith is therefore not trustworthy.
Peter Graham (2006) takes Lackey’s example and modifies it a little. This time the 
teacher is called Mr. Jones, who is supposed to teach his students the theory of evolution. 
Like Mrs. Smith, he is also a staunch creationist and does not believe in evolutionary the­
ory. He just pretends to accepts the theory to fulfill his duties as a teacher. He gets his 
information from textbooks and passes it on to his students. In this respect, the starting 
point is the same as in the case of Mrs. Smith. In Graham’s case, however, the story takes 
an unexpected turn. Jones makes a discovery one day: he finds the fossil of an extinct 
animal that he believes should not actually exist. That’s because it’s at least one million 
years old, making it much older than the world according to the creation story. But Jones

does not show his astonishment and his doubts and slips again into the role of the con­
vinced evolution theorist. He shows the fossil to his students, keeps his opinion to himself, 
and explains the fossil as Darwin would have done. The students now know that the fossil 
is older than one million years. Jones does not believe this. Graham argues that this gives 
the students a new knowledge. This is because nobody knew about the fossil before Jones 
discovered it. Therefore, no one could have known before that it was older than one mil­
lion years. Graham (2006, p. 113) concludes: “Testimony sometimes generates knowledge.”

Peter Baumann defends the view that knowledge is social in nature and that knowledge 
from hearsay is not reducible to other forms of knowledge. According to this view, the 
receiver can trust the sender and need not verify the truth of the message himself. Baumann 
(2015, p. 279 ff.) substantiates his thesis with an example: Maria goes for a walk, taking 
longer than planned, and wants to look at her watch. Now she notices that she has forgot­
ten her watch and hasn’t taken her smartphone with her. Therefore, she asks a pedestrian 
for the time. The pedestrian looks at his watch and gives the desired information: “It is 
now a quarter past 3.” Does Maria thereby acquire knowledge? Does she now know what 
time it is? Maria does not know the pedestrian, so she has no meta-knowledge about him 
and cannot assess whether he is telling the truth or just trying to mislead her. On what basis 
can she trust him? She could draw on her experience: In the past, when she wanted to 
know something from someone else, she always got the right answer. Maria can now 
inductively conclude from her experience that the pedestrian is also telling the truth. 
Baumann, however, considers this approach unrealistic and remote from life. Usually, no 
5 The conclusion makes use of the closure principle, which states that “if a person S knows that p, 
and if S also knows that q follows from p, then S also knows that q.” (Ernst 2010, p. 117) The closure 
principle is a theorem of epistemic logic (Ditmarsch et al. 2008, p. 27).
4.6  Second-Hand Knowledge

one keeps record of how often other people tell the truth and, apart from that, we would 
have to check the truthfulness of their statements and for that reason we have to consult 
other sources of knowledge. If this knowledge again comes from second-hand sources, an 
infinite regress results. Baumann draws from this the conclusion that we have to rely on 
the information of other people. “Hearsay cannot be reduced to other, non-social sources 
of knowledge – such as perception and inference – but constitutes an independent source 
of knowledge on a par with other sources.” (Baumann 2015, p. 281) Baumann justifies this 
with the social nature of language acquisition: even children have to rely on the assump­
tion that their parents teach them the truth.
This brings us back to the problem of trust: Can we trust other people? Do we perhaps 
even have to trust them, because otherwise, apart from first-hand knowledge, we would 
not be able to gain any new knowledge? This would be risky. If we had to rely on the prin­
ciple of trust, then Trump supporters would also be justified in believing their idol’s Twitter 
messages. We must therefore think carefully about whom we want to trust. That children 
can trust their parents is undeniable. Whether randomly chosen pedestrians tell the truth 
when being asked depends, among other things, on what you want to know from them. If 
you just ask them what time it is, they usually have no reason to lie. On the other hand, if 
you ask a Trump supporter who got the most votes in the 2020 presidential election, you 
can expect to get a false answer. Virologists and anti-vaxxers will make different state­
ments about the dangerousness of the Corona virus. Scientists make judgments based on 
the current state of research. A science denier, on the other hand, does not care about facts, 
but trusts his gut feeling: if he believes that the Corona virus is not dangerous, then this is 
the truth for him. The difference consists in how experts and laypeople arrive at their find­
ings. We should therefore primarily not trust persons, but trust in those methods of knowl­
edge acquisition that are reliable and scientifically sound. If a pedestrian determines the 
time according to a reliable method and shares his knowledge with us, we can rely on it.
These considerations show that second-hand knowledge should always be treated with 
caution. We take the easy way if we accept something as true unchecked just because other 
people assert it. We can only trust those sources of knowledge which we know well, which 
use reliable methods of knowledge acquisition, and about which we possess meta-­
knowledge in order to assess them as good informants. This applies especially to internet 
sources, as I will explain in the case of Google and Wikipedia.

A similar case is Google. Google provides a vast amount of information. Whether it is 
knowledge we can trust depends on the sources. A search engine only provides links that 
refer to other websites. Thus, Google is nothing more than a transmitter of information, 
but it is not unbiased and neutral. Rather, Google’s PageRank algorithm selects and priori­
tizes information. Not all Google links refer to reliable sources. Therefore, one has no 
guarantee to get only true information. In this respect, Google is not a good informant. In 
a way, Google is like Mrs. Smith: even when a Google source tells the truth, the informa­
tion can be biased and provide an ideologically distorted picture of reality.

John is a guest at a dinner party where he has a very animated conversation with the 
other guests. The conversation turns to religion. One guest remarks that Karl Marx once 
said: “God is dead”. A lady objects that the quote is not from Marx, but from Dostoyevsky. 
Next to her is an older gentleman who disagrees: “No, I’m quite sure I read it in Heidegger.” 
John has not read the works of Marx, Dostoyevsky, or Heidegger and fears he has nothing 
to contribute to the intellectual discourse. He would like to say something, too. When 
nobody watches him, he reaches for his smartphone, types “God is dead” into Google, and 
eventually lands on a Wikipedia page about Friedrich Nietzsche, where he gets the desired 
information. What he reads there is new to him. All he knew about Nietzsche until now 
was that he wrote a book called “Thus Spoke Zarathustra.” Now he can finally impress his 
interlocutors by pretending the great Nietzsche expert, saying, “The quote is from Friedrich 
Nietzsche’s “Gay Science”, Aphorism 125, where Nietzsche is talking about the mad­
man.” The other guests are flabbergasted. Instinctively, John hopes that they don’t want to 
know more about Nietzsche and quickly change the subject.
Basically, John has just picked up a piece of information, a grain of knowledge which 
is useless for him. He can’t say anything about Nietzsche’s philosophy, nor does he know 
who the “madman” is or what is meant by “God is dead”. What he has found on Wikipedia 
6 Wikipedians point out that authors have to earn their trust through their contributions and active 
participation in the wiki community (Jemielniak 2014, p. 118).

is a puzzle piece that he cannot assemble into a complete picture. He possesses a dead 
body of knowledge that he can’t bring to life. But like John, many internet users feel the 
same way. You look something up quickly, get the information off the net, don’t care if the 
source is trustworthy and reliable, and thus think you know something. At best, it is a 
fragmentary “Google knowledge” that lacks a deeper understanding. Knowledge requires 
active and critical engagement with the content. Moreover, Google does not distinguish 
between true and false information. Secondary knowledge cannot replace primary knowl­
edge. Google is a good source of information. But only an enlightened user can gain 
knowledge from it.
In 1909, the English author E. M. Forster wrote a science fiction story called “The 
Machine Stops” (2009), which reads like a parable of today’s Internet society. People live 
in underground cells where they lack all contact with the outside world and where a 
machine cares for them. In their smart home, they can use video communication to contact 
friends who also live in their honeycombs underground. The communication network 
described in the story is very close to the Internet known today. There are no books any 
more, people receive all information from the “Machine”. Since the inhabitants cannot 
enter the earth’s surface, they do not know what it looks like there. The Machine tells them 
that the world there is uninhabitable. But they cannot verify what the Machine tells them. 
All their knowledge is second-hand. First-hand knowledge does not exist and is despised 
as inauthentic. The information that the Machine gives them about the past refers to other 
sources in which texts interpret other texts and in which the outside world exists only as 
an imaginary world (see Zoglauer 2018, p. 38 ff.). The texts and messages that the Machine 
produces do not refer to facts, but only to other texts and signs within the Machine’s 
infosphere:
First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by live 
and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let our ideas be second-­
hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing ele­
ment – direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine – the French 
Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch 
thought Ho-Young thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought Lafcadio Hearn thought Carlyle thought 
Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. (Forster 2009, p. 29)
What Forster describes here is the dystopia of a post-truth society. The facts have faded 
and disappeared long before or are inaccessible. It no longer matters whether the informa­
tion which the Machine supplies is true or false. The world is “delivered to people’s 
homes” by the Machine and has become “phantom and matrix” without contact to reality 
(Anders 1994, p. 97 ff.). The Machine is not a good informant. The people do not know 
who programmed the Machine or whether it is telling the truth about the world on the 
surface of the earth. But the Machine is the only source of information they have. The only 
way to gain a first-hand knowledge is to escape from the cave and climb to the Earth’s 
surface to check with one’s own eyes what the world looks like up there. Kuno, one of the 
inhabitants of the underground city, finds a way to the surface. He realizes that the world 
4  Information and Knowledge

133
on the surface is very different from the one described by the Machine: It is a world where 
the sun shines and the stars twinkle at night, and the air is not as stuffy as the artificial air 
produced by the Machine. But the Machine is stronger than Kuno. Its tentacles seize the 
fugitive and drag him back into the cave world.
Forster’s story shows that second-hand knowledge cannot replace authentic first-hand 
knowledge. Assertions must be tested against reality. To do that, you have to break out of 
the echo chamber. If we want real knowledge, we can’t rely on the Internet. This is why 
Michael Lynch (2017, p. 19) advises us that “real knowledge – knowledge of what is the 
case as opposed to what we just happen to think is the case – is possible only by escaping 
the machine and getting to the world ‘outside’”.

The End of Enlightenment?
David Hume’s critique of the belief in miracles provides an explanation for why so many 
people are deluded by mistaken beliefs and trust false authorities. Tales of ghosts, angels, 
demons, witchcraft, magic, and clairvoyance were widespread during Hume’s lifetime and 
were, so to speak, the fake news of the day. Everyone had heard of such wondrous occur­
rences, but few had supposedly witnessed them themselves. Knowledge was based entirely 
on hearsay. Hume observed, to his surprise, that the more fantastic the miracle tales were, 
the more readily they were received. The stories were imaginatively embellished, skill­
fully presented rhetorically, and eagerly absorbed by a gullible audience: “Eloquence, 
when at its highest pitch, leaves little room for reason or reflection; but addressing itself 
entirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates the willing hearers, and subdues their 
understanding.” (Hume 2007, p. 85) Listeners are moved, feeling chosen to be allowed to 
share this knowledge and to be heralds and messengers to announce the sensation to oth­
ers: “The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of propagating it, and of being 
the first reporters of it, spreads the intelligence.” (ibid.)
With this discourse analysis of miracle communication, Hume wants to show how dan­
gerous it is to rely solely on second-hand reports without critically questioning them or 
asking for evidence. The psychological mechanisms for spreading fake news are the same 
today as they were in the past. Only the narratives and the technical means to spread them 
have changed. Samuel Fleischacker (2013, p. 180 f.) laments a widespread hostility to sci­
ence and denial of empirical facts in the US, concluding that people are unwilling to use 
their own minds. Lee McIntyre (2015) speaks of “willful ignorance”, when people adhere 
to a false belief, shield themselves from criticism and ignore facts. Such a dogmatic atti­
tude is not only irrational, it contradicts the method of critical examination, which accord­
ing to Hans Albert (1991, p. 42 ff.) is a basic principle of the search for truth. Hume 
recommends sticking to facts and evidence. He leaves no doubt that for him science and 
the empirical method are the only authorities that people can trust: “It is experience only, 
which gives authority to human testimony.” (Hume 2007, p.  92) For McIntyre (2015, 
p.  120), the best method for gaining knowledge is the scientific method because it

134
critically examines its own findings and is able to correct errors. Fleischacker (2013, 
p.  181) suggests that critical thinking and the empirical scientific method should be 
included more extensively in school curricula.
What we need is a new Enlightenment. The Enlightenment is a critical project. It wants 
to critically question alleged certainties and, as Kant explains in his “Critique of Pure 
Reason”, reason also has constantly to reassure itself of its own foundations. Unfortunately, 
the Enlightenment, for which Hume and Kant stand exemplary, has recently fallen into 
disrepute. Postmodern thinkers identify the Enlightenment “with a hegemonic form of 
moral and political universalism, a blind faith in abstract reason, and a reductive and iso­
lating focus on the individual” (Rasmussen 2014a, p. 1). Enlightenment philosophy is 
blamed for colonialism, racism, imperialism, arrogant Eurocentric ways of thinking, and 
the oppression of women (Allen 2016, p. 16; Rasmussen 2018, p. 44): “Enlightenment 
ideals are entangled with relations of colonial domination and epistemic violence.” (Allen 
2016, p. 204) Undoubtedly, there is a temporal connection between the Enlightenment and 
hegemonic politics. But to make a causal connection out of it and to blame philosophy for 
all the evils of the time would be a fallacy. If one wants to uncover the genealogical roots 
of hegemonic thinking, one has to dig deeper. For colonialism, racism, imperialism, and 
discrimination against women existed already in antiquity. As Dennis Rasmussen (2014a) 
shows, the “enlightenment bashing” is based on a distorted image of the Enlightenment 
and a misinterpretation of its ideals.
Post-factualism is a form of counter-enlightenment. The Enlightenment thinkers 
regarded truth as the adversary of power and wanted to attack with their philosophy the 
church’s claim to sole representation of truth. Post-factualism, on the other hand, restores 
the once separate connection between truth and power. The postmodern doctrine holds that 
truth is produced by power: “the constructivist idea is that the power relations that gener­
ate and define discourses produce truths.” (Prado 2006, p. 84) Therefore, according to this 
theory, there are no truths and no facts independent of discursive practices (Prado 2006, 
p. 126). If truth is discourse-relative, then such post-factual discourses can no longer be 
criticized, since each discourse generates its own truths. There is the truth of science 
deniers, the truth of the conspiracy theorists, and the truth of the Trump supporters. If one 
wanted to criticize such discourses, one would have to criticize the exercise of power on 
which the discursive production of truth is based. One would have to distinguish between 
legitimate and illegitimate forms of exercising power and take a moral stand in this dis­
pute. This presupposes, first, a primacy of ethics over truth, and second, one has to 
acknowledge that this moral discourse produces its own criteria of truth and is itself based 
on power relations. Those who see themselves morally on the right side and subordinate 
truth to morality no longer need to worry about facts and can safely ignore them. Such 
indifference to truth is dangerous and sets us back behind the Enlightenment.
Stanley Fish (2016) indignantly rejects the charge that postmodern philosophy is 
responsible for Donald Trump’s post-factual politics. This accusation is indeed false. 
Nonetheless, Fish claims that there is no independent standard by which we can distin­
guish truth from falsehood: “there is no impartial benchmark that can independently sort 
4  Information and Knowledge

135
out the true facts from what is mere opinion or error.” Fish is not entirely wrong on this 
point either. For facts are always dependent on an epistemic perspective, and other per­
spectives can lead to other truths. However, Fish insists that facts are discourse-relative:
there are no facts that stand to the side of argument and can settle arguments; there are only 
facts that emerge in the course of argument, facts to which at least some people have been 
persuaded, although given what persuation is, its effects are unlikely to last; persuation can’t 
be done once and for all. (Fish 2016)
According to this view, facts are not immovably fixed, but are discursively negotiable. But 
how are facts negotiated? Is it done by referring to facts that are established by our best 
scientific theories, or by asserting something until the hearer believes it? Since there is no 
discourse-independent standard for truth, according to Fish, the latter is more likely the 
case: assertions of fact are just rhetorical tools that can be used to push a particular opin­
ion. In this view, an opinion is true if you can get away with it. It is precisely this concep­
tion of truth that Donald Trump has made the guiding principle of his post-factual politics 
and that ultimately helped him to triumph: you only have to sell something as truth until it 
is accepted, then it is true. Thus, Fish’s strategy of distancing himself from post-factualism 
fails. Without wanting to, he implicitly legitimizes Trump’s truth claim.
Are we living in a post-factual age? Immanuel Kant answered to the question of whether 
he was living in an enlightened age with a definite no. He regarded the Enlightenment as 
a process that had just begun during his lifetime and was not yet finished. Therefore, he 
could say that he lived in an “age of enlightenment.” Just as in Kant’s day, it is doubtful 
that people today are enlightened and use “their own understanding (…) without another’s 
guidance” (Kant 1996, p. 21). In this respect, we are living in an age that is not yet post-­
factual, but very much in danger of becoming post-factual.
