Cathode Rays
Theodore Arabatzis
The detection of cathode rays was a by-product of the investigation of the discharge
of electricity through rareﬁed gases. The latter phenomenon had been studied since
the early eighteenth century. By the middle of the nineteenth century it was known
that the passage of electricity through a partly evacuated tube produced a glow in
the gas, whose color depended on its chemical composition and its pressure. Below
a certain pressure the glow assumed a stratiﬁed pattern of bright and dark bands.
During the second half of the nineteenth century the discharge of electricity
through gases became a topic of intense exploratory experimentation, primarily
in Germany [21]. In 1855 the German instrument maker Heinrich Geißler (1815–
1879) manufactured improved vacuum tubes, which made possible the isolation
and investigation of cathode rays [23]. In 1857 Geissler’s tubes were employed by
Julius Pl¨ucker (1801–1868) to study the inﬂuence of a magnet on the electrical dis-
charge. He observed various complex and striking phenomena associated with the
discharge. Among those phenomena were a “light which appears about the negative
electrode” and a ﬂuorescence in the glass of the tube ([9], pp. 122, 130).
The understanding of those phenomena was advanced by Pl¨ucker’s student and
collaborator, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (1824–1914), who observed that “if any ob-
ject is interposed in the space ﬁlled with glow-light [emanating from the negative
electrode], it throws a sharp shadow on the ﬂuorescent side” ([5], p. 117). This effect
implied that the “rays” emanating from the cathode followed a straight path. Further-
more, Hittorf showed that those rays could be deﬂected by the action of a magnet.
In 1876 they were dubbed cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen) by Eugen Goldstein
(1850–1930) [2, 24]. Thus, by the late 1870s cathode rays had been identiﬁed and
some of their main observable properties had been established.
The nature of cathode rays remained a controversial subject for some years to
come. There were two opposing views concerning their constitution. The ﬁrst view
was maintained by British and French scientists, who identiﬁed cathode rays with
streams of charged particles. A well-known advocate of that view was the British ex-
perimentalist William Crookes (1832–1919). Crookes studied electrical discharges
through highly rareﬁed gases: “[T]he exhaustion carried out [is so high] that the
dark space around the negative pole . . . entirely ﬁlls the tube.” ([1], p. 6) Under
those conditions the behavior of cathode rays could be studied in isolation, without
interference from other discharge phenomena. Thus, Crookes determined, in a par-
ticularly clear manner, several properties of cathode rays: their “power of exciting
phosphorescence” (p. 7), their propagation in straight lines (p. 12), their power to
cast shadows (p. 15), their capacity to “exert strong mechanical action where they
strike” (p. 17) and to “produce heat when their motion is arrested” (p. 24), and
their deﬂection by a magnet (p. 20). He put forward the hypothesis that cathode
rays were charged molecules, “molecular bullets”, which he justiﬁed on the basis

of their magnetic deﬂection and their capacity to perform mechanical work. Fur-
thermore, from the direction of their magnetic deﬂection he inferred that they were
negatively charged. Several years later, in 1895, Jean B. Perrin (1870–1942) would
arrive at the same conclusion by means of a different experiment [8].
Another eminent scientist who defended the particulate interpretation of cathode
rays was Arthur Schuster (1851–1934). In 1884 he suggested that they were nega-
tively charged atoms [10]. In 1890 he calculated the upper and lower bounds of their
charge to mass ratio (e/m), based on measurements of their magnetic deﬂection and
an estimate of their velocity. The lower limit was close to the charge to mass ratio
of electrolytic ions. The upper limit was three orders of magnitude higher ([11],
pp. 546–547).
The second view concerning the nature of cathode rays was advocated by some
German physicists, who identiﬁed them with processes in the ether. Their main
argument was that cathode rays have some of the properties of light-waves. For
instance, they both travel in straight lines and produce ﬂuorescence. The ethereal
interpretation of cathode rays received additional support in 1883, when Heinrich
Hertz (1857–1894) failed to deﬂect them by an electric ﬁeld [3,22]. In the following
years, new experimental facts were discovered which seemed to undermine further
the interpretation of cathode rays as charged particles. In 1892 Hertz showed that
they could penetrate thin sheets of metal (e.g., gold, silver, aluminum) [4]. In 1893
his student, Philipp Lenard (1862–1947), built upon Hertz’s work to investigate the
behavior of cathode rays outside the vacuum tube. He devised a tube with a thin
metallic “window” facing the cathode. The cathode rays passed through that window
and, thus, Lenard could measure their mean free path outside the tube. As it turned
out, it was much longer than that of atoms and molecules. Furthermore, he showed
that their absorption depended only on the density of the absorbing substance [7].
Thus, different experimental results supported different accounts of the nature of
cathode rays. Furthermore, the evidential import of some of those results was am-
biguous. On the one hand, the magnetic deﬂection of cathode rays, which indicated
that they were charged particles, was compatible with an ethereal interpretation of
their nature. It was conceivable that the magnetic ﬁeld altered the state of the ether
so as to produce a deﬂection of the rays ([17], p. 285). On the other hand, the capac-
ity of cathode rays to pass through thin metallic sheets, which suggested that they
were waves in the ether, could be accommodated by the hypothesis that cathode rays
were charged particles. In 1893 J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) argued that the capacity
in question was only apparent: what really happened, according to Thomson, was
that the material bombarded by cathode rays turned into a source of cathode rays
itself.
The cathode ray controversy was resolved by Thomson in 1897. He had studied
electrical discharges in gases since 1883 and the discovery of  X-rays by Wilhelm
Conrad R¨ontgen (1845–1923) rekindled his interest in cathode rays. In a lecture
to the Royal Institution on 30 April 1897, Thomson argued that cathode rays were
composed of minute, sub-atomic particles that he named “corpuscles”. Their small
size followed, according to Thomson, from Lenard’s results concerning their mean
free path outside the cathode ray tube. A further indication of their small size was

provided by Thomson measurements of their mass to charge ratio, which turned out
to be very small in comparison to the corresponding ratio of hydrogen ions [12].
A few months later, in October 1897, Thomson presented his case for the partic-
ulate interpretation of cathode rays in more detail [13]. He reported a novel result
favoring that interpretation: the deﬂection of cathode rays by an electric ﬁeld. Fur-
thermore, he reported a series of measurements of the mass to charge ratio (m/e)
of cathode ray particles, whose purpose was to enable him to ﬁgure out their iden-
tity. He obtained those measurements by means of two different approaches. The
ﬁrst one was based on measurements of the charge carried by cathode rays, the heat
produced by their impact on a target, and the effect of a magnetic ﬁeld on their tra-
jectory. A combination of those data led to an estimate of m/e. The guiding idea
behind the second approach was to place cathode rays under the inﬂuence of an
electric and a magnetic ﬁeld and to adjust the intensity of the latter “so that the elec-
trostatic deﬂexion [sic] was the same as the magnetic” ([13], p. 309). It was then
possible to calculate m/e on the basis of directly measurable parameters. Thomson
obtained the following value: m/e = H 2l/FΘ, where H and F were, respectively,
the intensities of the magnetic and the electric ﬁelds, l the length of the region un-
der the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld, and Θ the angle of electric (or magnetic) deﬂection.
Both methods indicated that the value of m/e was three orders of magnitude smaller
than “the smallest value of this quantity previously known, and which is the value
for the hydrogen ion in electrolysis” ([13], p. 310). Furthermore, the value of m/e
was independent of the material of the cathode and the chemical composition of the
gas within the cathode ray tube. This independence suggested to Thomson that the
“corpuscles” were universal constituents of all material substances.
In the early months of 1897 analogous results of the charge to mass ratio of
cathode rays were reported by Emil Wiechert (1861–1928) and Walter Kaufmann
(1871–1947). Those physicists, however, drew different conclusions from their ex-
periments. Wiechert identiﬁed the constituents of cathode rays with disembodied
charges [14,15]; and Kaufmann suggested that the unexpectedly large ratio of e/m
refuted the particulate interpretation of cathode rays [6]. According to our knowl-
edge today, the cathode rays are nothing but swiftly moving  electrons.
