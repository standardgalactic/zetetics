Data from the Gaia satellite show that the solar neighbourhood of the Milky Way’s stellar halo
is imprinted with substructure from several accretion events. Evidence of these events is found in
“the Shards”, stars clustering with high signiﬁcance in both action space and metallicity. Stars in
the Shards share a common origin, likely as ancient satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, so will be
embedded in dark matter (DM) counterparts. These “Dark Shards” contain two substantial streams
(S1 and S2), as well as several retrograde, prograde and lower energy substructures. The retrograde
stream S1 has a very high Earth-frame speed of ∼550 km s−1 while S2 moves on a prograde, but
highly polar orbit and enhances the peak of the speed distribution at around 300 km s−1.
The
presence of the Dark Shards locally leads to modiﬁcations of many to the fundamental properties of
experimental DM signals. The S2 stream in particular gives rise to an array of eﬀects in searches for
axions and in the time dependence of nuclear recoils: shifting the peak day, inducing nonsinusoidal
distortions, and increasing the importance of the gravitational focusing of DM by the Sun. Dark
Shards additionally bring new features for directional signals, while also enhancing the DM ﬂux
towards Cygnus.

INTRODUCTION
The stellar populations of the Milky Way are con-
structed through two distinct channels: an in situ for-
mation of the bulk of the stars in the disk and bulge
of the Galaxy, followed by an ex situ accumulation of
substructure that builds most of the stellar halo [1, 2].
The latter stage involves the tidal stripping of stars and
dark matter (DM) from surrounding satellites and sub-
halos and ultimately gives rise to the network of stellar
streams that entwine the Milky Way [3–7]. The recent
and transformative dataset of astrometry on over a billion
stars bestowed upon us by the Gaia satellite [8–10] has
brought into focus the extent of this network of streams
in the vicinity of Earth [11–15].
This is because Gaia
has enabled a vast increase in the number of stars for
which six-dimensional phase space coordinates are ob-
tainable. While many of the largest and most famous
stellar streams are readily identiﬁable on the sky from
photometry alone [16], phase space information is essen-
tial in identifying nearby streams that are dispersed over
large areas of the sky.
Here, we use a sample of Gaia main sequence stars in
the stellar halo, which are cross-matched with the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The chemo-dynamical struc-
ture of the stellar halo has been studied extensively in the
last few years. We now know that its velocity ellipsoid ex-
hibits two primary components with striking diﬀerences.
One is a more metal-poor and essentially isotropic fea-
ture associated to the ancient, virialised halo. The other

is more metal-rich and highly radially anisotropic [17–
21]. This object was baptised the “Gaia Sausage” after
its squashed and elongated shape in velocity space. It is
most likely the relic of a major head-on collision between
a dwarf spheroidal and the Milky Way approximately 8–
10 billion years ago [19, 22–25]. The aspect of the local
stellar halo that has received less detailed study however
is the plethora of substructure [11, 12, 26–29]. An exten-
sive list of these substructures, designated “the Shards”,
was presented recently in Ref. [12], although some of
these were anticipated in earlier searches [11, 26, 30, 31].
The substructures are largely at high energy and many
are members of the prominent retrograde tail that was
known earlier [32].
The list of stellar substructures is
surely incomplete and will continue to grow as further
searches are made through the Gaia data. Nevertheless,
the Shards will likely remain the most prominent exam-
ples locally since they have the highest signiﬁcance and
were found in incomplete samples and with brute-force
techniques [11, 26]. Therefore we will use the Shards as
typical representatives in the local stellar halo of the ex
situ phase of the Milky Way’s growth.
Given the observations of the stellar Shards, we expect
there to be DM counterparts: the “Dark Shards”, relics
of the DM subhalos that hosted the progenitors of the
Shards. The material in streams remains kinematically
cold, so the Dark Shards will have narrow velocity disper-
sions, smaller than their mean orbital velocities. Hence
if even a small fraction of the local DM density is com-
prised of streams, the resulting speed distribution may
be very diﬀerent from the smooth Maxwellians used by
experiments searching for DM on Earth [33–38]. Many
methods for detecting DM are highly dependent on, or at
the very least require, assumptions for the distribution of
particle velocities in the Solar System. High energy, in-

atively recently in the Milky Way’s growth will make this
distribution distinctly non-Gaussian.
The extensive literature (e.g., Refs. [39–61]) on the sub-
ject of the astrophysical uncertainties of direct DM detec-
tion has typically only investigated the impact of changes
to the broad shape of the speed distribution f(v), often
inspired by the variety of functional forms observed in
simulations [62–65]. Ex situ material has the potential
to make more complex modiﬁcations to expected signals
in DM experiments. While this topic has been discussed
somewhat in studies taking inspiration from cosmologi-
cal simulations [66, 67], this component of the local DM
distribution is the most problematic for model-building,
given that it encodes all the particularities and peculiar-
ities of the formation of the Milky Way. However, the
advent of Gaia and the discovery of substructures like
the Shards means that these peculiarities now have an
observable counterpart. This data-driven perspective has
been followed in several recent studies [68–76]. This work
has so far dealt with the shape of f(v) accounting for the
isotropic and Sausage components observed in the Gaia
stellar halo. Here, our focus is not on the overall shape,
but on the ﬂuctuations and deviations from Gaussianity
caused by the presence of a host of accreted substructure.
While the Dark Shards will be subdominant, their con-
sequences for the velocity distribution are more complex
and interesting than simply a shift in functional form.
In terms of stellar content, two of the most substantial
Shards are the S1 and S2 streams [12, 26, 77].
Mod-
elling suggests that their progenitors had virial masses
≈1010M⊙and stellar masses ≈106M⊙, comparable to
modern day dwarf spheroidal satellites like Draco and
Ursa Minor. As the S1 stream is counterrotating, its as-
sociated DM meets the Earth head-on, so it leaves char-
acteristic signatures in experiments sensitive to high DM
speeds [78].
The S2 stellar stream is on a polar orbit
that passes through the Earth. Its implications for DM
experiments have not hitherto been studied.
To study the eﬀects of the Dark Shards on experimen-
tal DM signals in more detail, the earlier sections of this
paper are devoted to the reﬁning and remodelling of the
Shards from Ref. [12]. We begin in Sec. II by describing
our sample of halo stars from the SDSS-Gaia catalogue
and then discuss the stellar Shards in detail in Sec. III.
We then use the data and our list of substructures to
inspire a model for the local DM distribution in Sec. IV.
We discuss the new features present in this velocity dis-
tribution when observed in the rest frame of the Earth in
Sec. V. In the remaining two sections, we detail the con-
sequences of these new features in experiments looking
for axions and axion-like particles (Sec. VI), and nuclear
recoil-based searches for DM (Sec. VII). In the latter case
we also discuss the eﬀects on annual modulation and di-
rectional signals. We conclude in Sec. VIII.
A GitHub repository [79] is available which contains
links to IPython notebooks for individually reproducing
each result.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE LOCAL
STELLAR HALO
The SDSS-Gaia catalogue enhances and recalibrates
the astrometric solution of the SDSS’s 9th data re-
lease [80] with parallaxes and proper motions from
Gaia [8, 10].
This catalogue expands our view of the
Milky Way halo out to heliocentric distances of approx-
imately 10 kpc.
The majority of the radial velocities
are sourced from SDSS; however a minor fraction are
cross-matched with spectroscopic surveys APOGEE [81],
LAMOST DR3 [82] and RAVE-on [83, 84]. Since pho-
tometric parallaxes are calculable for main sequence
turnoﬀ[85] and blue horizontal branch stars [86], we use
these stars to construct a sample of the disk and halo
with six-dimensional phase space information out to ap-
proximately 10 kpc.
To extract the stellar halo from this selection of stars,
we adopt a similar set of cuts to those in Refs. [11, 12].
To ensure a high quality sample, stars are selected with
photometric parallax distances < 10 kpc, a heliocentric
radial velocity error < 15 km s−1, and distance errors
< 2.5 kpc. Then, and importantly for this work, stars
with clear membership to the galactic thin and thick
disks have been removed.
Disk stars occupy positive
azimuthal velocities, vφ ≳100 km s−1 and high metal-
licities [Fe/H] ≳−1 (see e.g., Fig. 1 of Ref. [11]). The
cut of disk stars is based on these two parameters, but
to leave as much of the halo intact as possible it has not
been applied too aggressively. Therefore some contami-
nation remains from the metal-poor tail of the thick disk
which overlaps strongest with the halo in the [Fe/H]-vφ
plane. We will see this contamination for metallicities
[Fe/H] ∼−2.1–−1.6. After the cuts, the sample contains
65406 stars.

The smooth component
Figure 1 shows 2-d histograms of the stellar halo sam-
ple in vR and vφ, the radial and azimuthal velocities.1
We divide the total sample into nine histograms, with
cuts on the height above or below the disk |z| and iron
abundance [Fe/H], as indicated by the black dashed lines
above and to the right of the nine histograms. A strik-
ing observation can be made when the metal rich panels
(right) are compared with the metal-poor panels (left):
the distribution of stars is clearly extended in vR in the
right-most panels, making it sausage-shaped.
In con-
trast, the distribution of stars in the left-most panels is
circular, consistent with a roundish, isotropic halo. We
will refer to this as the “Round Halo” to distinguish it
from the radially anisotropic “Sausage”. Some contami-

FIG. 1. Kinematic structure of the stellar halo sample. The central panels show 2-d histograms of the radial and azimuthal
velocities, vR and vφ, of the SDSS-Gaia stellar halo sample used in this paper. Darker colours represent a higher star count.
The full sample has been divided into nine bins in terms of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and distance away from the disk plane (|z|), as
indicated by the dashed black lines (following Ref [19]). Reading from left to right corresponds to increasing [Fe/H], while from
top to bottom corresponds to increasing |z|. The green cross shows the mean velocity in each bin, while N gives the number of
stars (there are 261 stars with [Fe/H] < −3 or |z| > 9 that are not included in the 2-d histograms). We decompose the sample
into three components: Round Halo, Sausage and Thick disk. Their 1-d [Fe/H] and |z| distributions are shown above and to
the right of the histograms. The fraction of each component in the nine bins is given by the coloured percentage values.
nation by thick disk stars can also be seen in the top-row
middle panel at vφ ≃125 km s−1 and vR ≃0.0 km s−1.
Above and to the right of the 2-d histograms, we show
the 1-d histograms of |z| and [Fe/H] for the three compo-
nents: the Round Halo (red), Sausage (blue) and thick
disk (green). To partition the stars in this way, we have
decomposed the sample by applying a Gaussian mixture
model using the stellar velocity and metallicity data:
q = {vR, vφ, vz, [Fe/H]}. The probability density func-
tion for the three components that we ﬁt to the stellar
sample is,

we give the means, weights and covariances for this de-
composition for the complete stellar halo sample.
As has been noted before [18–20, 87], the Sausage com-
ponent dominates the local stellar halo in main sequence

stars.
It has also been identiﬁed independently with
other tracers including blue horizontal branch stars [86,
88], RR Lyraes [22, 89] and K giants [90]. The character-
istic range of metallicities, [Fe/H]≈−1.4, means that its
stars are slightly more metal-rich than the halo average
(≈−1.9) but metal-poor relative to the (thin and thick)
disks (≈−0.8). This strongly suggests that the Sausage
component is the remnant of a merger in the Milky Way’s
recent past. The unusual kinematic proﬁle implies that
the merger was a head-on collision with an object on a
low inclination orbit [19]. The progenitor Sausage galaxy
most likely had a total mass ≳1010 M⊙and was accreted
around redshift ≲3 [19, 24, 91].
B.
The Shards
The Round Halo and the Sausage are apparent when
visualising the full sample in velocity space. The impor-
tance of the ex-situ halo, the accreted part of our Galaxy,
on the other hand is more evident in action space [92].
Actions are adiabatic invariants so are conserved under
slow evolution of the potential. This means that stars
belonging to a discrete bound object that are accreted to-
gether slowly will remain clustered in action space even if
they are too dispersed or too close to us to be identiﬁed
otherwise. Searching through action space is therefore
the most eﬃcient and powerful way to ﬁnd local sub-
structure. In addition to the three actions (JR, Jφ, Jz),
another useful quantity is the orbital energy, E, as sub-
structure from recent in-falls is usually at high energy.
The distribution of the full sample in these three ac-
tions versus energy are shown in the top row of Fig. 2.
Actions are computed using the numerical methods re-
viewed in Ref. [93] and the updated Milky Way potential
from McMillan [94].
The action space distribution of the sample contains
abundant substructure which is highlighted in the top
row of Fig. 2. The 30 highest signiﬁcance clusters were
initially listed in Ref. [12]; however the list in fact extends
to a total of 69. We call all these action-space clusters
“Shards” throughout our paper. Action space clusterings
are typically associated with kinematically cold streams,
however only a fraction of the reported Shards are signiﬁ-
cant enough for this interpretation to be ascribed. Those
action space clusters that are not focused tightly around
single streaming velocities are sometimes referred to as
“clumps”, “objects” or “moving groups” [11]. For exam-
ple our list of Shards include the prominent S1 and S2
streams as well as the clump C2, themselves rediscoveries
of earlier reported objects found in phase space [11, 26].
For clarity, we refer to S1 and S2 as “streams”, and
simply use the term “substructures” for the remaining
Shards.
In Fig. 2 we grouped them together into two
categories “Retrograde” and “Prograde” according to the
sign of their Jφ (these correspond to the Rg and Cand
labels used in Ref. [11]). In total, the Shards comprise a
subset of 1117 stars in the Gaia-SDSS halo sample.2
The Retrograde Shards contain some of the highest
energy stars in the halo and seem to be comparatively
metal-rich, with −1.9 ≲
[Fe/H]
≲
−1.3.
While a
similar range of metallicities is found for the Sausage
stars, the characteristic abundances of other α-elements
in the retrograde tail clearly distinguishes them in ori-
gin from the Sausage galaxy [95–97]. It has been sug-
gested that this retrograde tail and the substructures it
contains may all be associated with another major low-
inclination accretion of a 1010M⊙dwarf galaxy, dubbed
the “Sequoia” [98]. This interpretation is bolstered by
several globular clusters on retrograde orbits that we
have have also marked on Fig. 2. These include the ex-
tended globular cluster FSR1758 [99, 100] —from which
the arboreal moniker originates—-as well as the anoma-
lous ω Centauri, which has for many years been believed
to have begun life as the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy [101].
These clusters may have all originally been part of the
Sequoia galaxy.
One of the most important Shards,
S1—already the subject of some discussion in the lit-
erature [78, 102, 103]— appears to be associated with
the globular cluster NGC 3201 which may have resided
within the Sequoia.
2 While the Shards were originally identiﬁed in the Gaia-SDSS
sample with Gaia-DR1 proper motions, we have veriﬁed that
the ﬁtted parameters of the S1 and S2 streams are essentially
unchanged when the slightly improved Gaia-DR2 is used. This
is likely to be the case for the majority of the Shards.

MODELLING THE SHARDS
We ﬁt each Shard with a Gaussian mixture model
based on available data: q = {X, Y, Z, vR, vφ, vz, [Fe/H]},
i.e., D = 7 in Eq.(1).
We include spatial information
here to improve the measurement of the trajectory of the
stream and to allow us to estimate the velocity at the
solar position. While a Gaussian is a good description of
a stream’s cross section, it is not usually used to describe

FIG. 3. Distributions of stellar velocities in galactic cylindrical coordinates for four Shards: S1, S2, Rg5 and Cand14. The
velocity of stars associated with each Shard are shown as green points. Fits to the seven-dimensional (position, velocity and
metallicity) data with the Gaussian mixture model [Eq.(1)] are shown: the orange contour indicates an n = 1 Gaussian whereas
the blue contours show the n = 2 case. The extent of the SDSS-Gaia sample is shown in grey. For each Shard, we select
the number of wraps by using the minimum Bayesian information criterion. S1 is better ﬁt by one wrap, while S2, Rg5 and
Cand14 are better ﬁt by two wraps. The best-ﬁt parameters are given in the accompanying text. The signiﬁcance value P(x⊙)
quantiﬁes how far away the solar position is relative to the spatial distribution of each Shard.
the shape along the stream. However, given the small ex-
tent of the SDSS-Gaia footprint relative to the size of the
apocentric radii of the stellar orbits, this model should be
ﬁne. Ultimately the process of including the stellar spa-
tial positions is only to be able to remove those Shards
which clearly do not intersect the solar position.
Many clusters of stars in action space correspond to
separated clusters in velocity space coordinates. So we
vary the number of possible populations, n in Eq.(1). In
Fig. 3, we show the stellar velocity data for four Shards
ﬁtted to these models. We choose the two highest sig-
niﬁcance streams (S1 and S2) and two examples of ret-
rograde and prograde substructures (Rg5 and Cand14
respectively).

TABLE II. Basic parameters of the Shards. Those containing two populations in phase space are divided into two items “a”
and “b”. The Shards are organised into ﬁve categories: S1, S2, Retrograde, Prograde and Low-Energy (the latter group listed
in Table III for brevity). The signiﬁcance of the location of the Sun is given in σ in the ﬁnal column: a smaller number implies
that the substructure spatial distribution overlaps the Sun.
To quantify how distant each Shard is from Earth, we
also display P(x⊙), the signiﬁcance of the solar position
relative to the spatial distribution of the stars. We take
the solar position in galactocentric rectangular coordi-
nates to be x⊙= (8.2, 0, 0.014) kpc [94, 104, 105] and
calculate the signiﬁcance of this position in the Gaussian
ﬁt to the distribution of stellar locations.
To evaluate the most appropriate number of popula-
tions, we select the option which yields the minimum
Bayesian information criterion, although in most cases
this choice is visible by eye. For three of the four ex-
amples shown, we ﬁnd that there are two clear subpop-
ulations. These represent the leading and trailing tails
of stellar streams, which can stretch over large distances
and wrap the Galaxy multiple times. The power of action
space searches for substructure is that they allow a single
object to be identiﬁed, whereas a search in velocity space
would have typically found two distinct clusters.
The
Shards that do not exhibit this bimodal feature instead
are observable because they are close to the pericentric
passage of the stream. In these cases, we are positioned
close to the maximum stellar density along the stream.
Figure 4 visualises this idea. We plot the individual stel-
lar positions and velocities for three Shards and integrate
the orbits of those stars forward and backward in time
by 100 Myr using MWPotential2014 in the galpy pack-
age [106].
In the ﬁrst two examples, we see that stars are on orbits
that are grouped together tightly and are at a position
very close to pericentre. In the bottom row of Fig. 4, how-
ever, Cand14 has at least two wraps coinciding with the
solar position. The stars in this case are located at po-
sitions much larger than the mean pericentre of their or-
bits. This illustrates the interpretation discussed above,
that the Shards consist of (i) streams with pericentres
close to the solar position, and (ii) streams with multiple

9
wrappings coinciding with the solar position.
A complete summary of the ﬁt to each of the main sub-
structures is given in Table II. There is another, longer
list of the lower-signiﬁcance (and typically lower-energy)
Shards which we have included in Appendix A. There
are two streams in the Shards, labelled S1 and S2. The
remaining substructures tagged as “Rg” and “Cand” cor-
respond to the categories Retrograde and Prograde. We
now extend the naming convention of Ref. [12] to indicate
those streams with multiple wraps entering the survey
footprint. We add the suﬃx “a” and “b” in those cases.
This subtlety is a key diﬀerence between this list and that
of Ref. [12]. Accounting for multiple wraps prevents us
overestimating the velocity dispersions of the substruc-
tures which could be anomalously large otherwise.
In Table II, we also listed P(x⊙), the signiﬁcance of
the solar position relative to the spatial distribution of
the stars. In the next Section, we will devise a model
for the Dark Shards in the velocity distribution.
For
this, we select only those candidates with signiﬁcances
< 2 and populations > 4.
This means that only the
most important Shards for DM searches are considered.
Notably C2, which has a relatively high signiﬁcance in
action space, is located too far away from the Sun to be
included in our model. The Shards that remain are those
listed in Tables II and III, a total of 59.
To streamline our discussion even further, we organise
the Shards into ﬁve categories: S1, S2, Retrograde, Pro-
grade and Low Energy. S1 and S2 are given their own
status to reﬂect their very high signiﬁcance as clusters in
action space. The Retrograde Shards all have similar sig-
niﬁcances that are lower than S1 and S2, but since they
share kinematic and chemical properties it is reasonable
to group them together.
This is also the case for the
Prograde category. The Low Energy category consists
of all of the remaining lower signiﬁcance Shards listed in
Table III.
IV.
DARK SHARDS IN THE HALO MODEL
The
DM
associated
with
the
Shards—the
Dark
Shards—will change the local velocity distribution of DM
and therefore impact the observable signals in direct de-
tection experiments on Earth. In this section, utilising
the properties of the Shards in Table II, we construct a
simple model for the Milky Way DM halo to study the
eﬀects of the Dark Shards.
Our model consists of three components: the roundish,
isotropic halo fR(v); the Gaia Sausage fS(v); and the
Dark Shards fξ(v).
The velocity distribution in the
galactic frame is the sum of the three components,
fgal(v) = ξRfR(v) + ξSfS(v) +
nξ
X
i=1
ξif i
ξ(v) ,
(2)
where the sum extends over the nξ Dark Shards and
ξR, ξS and ξi give the fractional weighting to the local
DM density in the Round Halo, Sausage and each Shard,
respectively.
By deﬁnition, ξR + ξS + ξtot = 1, where
ξtot = Pnξ
i=1 ξi. We will ﬁrst discuss the functional forms
for fR(v), fS(v) and f i
ξ(v) before turning to discuss the
weighting that we assign to each component.
1.
The Round DM Halo
We model the velocity distribution of the Round DM
Halo as a smooth, isotropic Gaussian distribution [107]:
fR(v) =
1
(2πσ2v)3/2NR,esc
exp

−|v|2
2σ2v

× Θ(vesc −|v|) .
(3)
Here, σv is the velocity dispersion which is set, at the
solar position, by the value of the local standard of
rest v0 =
√
2σv = 235 kms−1. We have adjusted the
value of v0 from Ref. [72] by taking into account the more
recent determination of the distance to the galactic cen-
tre, R0 [105]. We truncate the velocity distribution at
the galactic escape speed vesc, using the Heaviside func-
tion Θ. The constant NR,esc ensures the velocity distri-
bution remains normalised to unity

A recent analysis that used a local sample of approx-
imately 2300 high velocity counterrotating stars and
a prior distribution inspired by numerical simulations
obtained the value vesc = 528+24
−25 km s−1 [108], in
agreement with, but improving upon, earlier determina-
tions [109, 110].
2.
The Sausage
We follow the SHM++ [72] and model the Sausage com-
ponent with a triaxial Gaussian velocity distribution,
fS(v) =

stars, β = 0.9 [18, 19]. The escape speed normalisation

Since the SHM++ is a model that contains only fR and
fS, we refer to the case when ξtot = 0 as the SHM++.
3.
The Dark Shards
In the context of this paper, f i
ξ(v) is the most impor-
tant component in Eq.(2) as it models the Dark Shards.
We write each subcomponent as
f i
ξ(v) =
1
(8π3 det σi 2
ξ )1/2Nξ,esc
× exp
 
−(v −vi
ξ)T (σi
ξ)−2

(v −vi

!
× Θ(vesc −|v|) .
(8)
Compared with the Round Halo and the Gaia Sausage,
the Dark Shards do not have zero mean velocity in the
galactic frame of reference. Instead, the triaxial velocity
distribution is oﬀset by the velocity of the moving sub-
structure, vξ. Furthermore, we allow for a general veloc-
ity dispersion tensor σξ. We include the Heaviside func-
tion to truncate the velocity distribution at the escape
speed.
In practice, as the subcomponents are peaked
away from vesc and as their velocity dispersion is rela-
tively small, the eﬀect of the truncation is negligible.
We make the approximation that the velocity disper-
sions σξ that enter f i
ξ(v) are the same as the stellar
components listed in Table II. This assumption is prob-
ably not true in detail. For instance, numerical simula-
tions have shown that the DM stream associated with the
Sagittarius stream are more extended and are misaligned
from the stellar component [112, 113].
However, the
progenitor of the Sagittarius stream is a dwarf irregular
galaxy [114], which had its stars initially distributed in a
disk and its DM in a round halo, so this mismatch is an
extreme case. The dwarf spheroidals, which are believed
to have produced S1, S2, and the other Shards [11], have
DM and stellar populations that have similar spheroidal
shapes before they were accreted. Nonetheless, the veloc-
ity dispersion of the DM and stars in the progenitor is not
exactly the same, and so mismatches between DM and
stellar streams are still expected, albeit on a smaller scale
than for the Sagittarius stream. Our approximation is
reasonable for the dwarf spheroidal regime, though work
to fully test its accuracy using a numerical simulations is
desirable.
A.
Weighting the halo components
From Eq.(2), we also need to specify ξR, ξS and ξi,
the fractional contribution that each component makes
to the local DM density. Although these cannot be deter-
mined fromGaia data, there are some general statements
that we can make about their relative values. For exam-
ple, the gravitational potential is nearly spherical [115],
so the DM associated with the Sausage and the Shards
is subdominant. In Ref. [72] it was argued that the Gaia
Sausage can contribute around 20% to the local DM den-
sity without exceeding the bound of 1% on the ellipticity
of the equipotentials of the Milky Way. A value ∼20% is
also consistent with the fraction obtained from the FIRE-
2 simulations [71], and is in accordance with the interpre-
tation of the Sausage’s formation determined using the
Auriga simulations [76, 116]. As the stellar Shards are
not the dominant component of the main sequence stel-
lar halo sample, it is unlikely that their progenitors will
have brought more DM into the inner halo than, say, the
Sausage. So ξtot will certainly be smaller than 20%.
To motivate us towards a lower limit to ξtot , we can
refer to the library of N-body minor merger accretion
events [117], as used in the interpretation of S1 and S2
in Ref. [11].
Streams originating from ∼1010M⊙and
∼5 × 109M⊙subhalos, believed to be the approximate
total masses of the S1 and S2 progenitors, were found to
contribute O(1%) to the local DM density at the solar
location. The simulations made simplifying approxima-
tions about the DM distribution in the in-falling satellite
and the host galaxy, and the impact of the Milky Way
disk was not included. Despite these limitations, they
suggest that a reasonable range for the total contribu-
tion from all of the substructures in Tables II and III
is 1% ≲ξtot ≲10%.
Following Ref. [72], we will ﬁx
ξS = 20% and the round DM halo contributes the rest:
ξR = 80% −ξtot.
After this, we are still left with the task of specifying
ξi, the contribution from each individual Dark Shard. As
discussed in Sec. III, to reﬂect the relative importance
of the clusters of stars in action space, it is prudent to
group the Shards into ﬁve categories: S1, S2, Retrograde,
Prograde, and Low Energy components. We next apply
an equal weighting to each category (e.g., each category
contributes 2% when ξtot = 10%). Finally, since the in-
dividual Shards within each category have diﬀerent star
counts and positions relative to the Solar System, we
weight the contribution of the Shards within each cate-
gory by the number of stars multiplied by the height of
the spatial distribution of stars at the solar position.
While the weighting prescription just described is a
benchmark case, we will see it captures much of the re-
sulting phenomenology of the diﬀerent categories of sub-
structure. If slight changes to the weighting lead to par-
ticularly interesting experimental signals however, then
these will also be discussed.

FIG. 5. The distributions of the three components of the galactic rest frame velocities. The solid black lines in the upper
panels show the total distribution, including the isotropic Round Halo, Gaia Sausage and Dark Shard components assuming
the Dark Shards contribute 10% to the local DM density (ξtot = 10%). The distribution without the Dark Shards is shown
as the black dashed line. The coloured regions show the contribution from each of the S1, S2, Retrograde, Prograde, and Low
Energy categories: these distributions are stacked one upon the other in reverse order to aid the visibility of all the features.
The lower panels show the stacked distributions from the Dark Shards alone.
B.
The galactic rest frame distribution
In Fig. 5 we present the galactic rest frame distri-
butions of each galactocentric cylindrical polar velocity
component.
The upper solid black line shows the ve-
locity distributions obtained when ξtot = 10% and the
weighting prescription just described is used. The lower
dashed black line shows the SHM++ distribution nor-
malised to 90%. This is to highlight the eﬀect of the 10%
contribution from the Dark Shards which adds on top of
the 90% SHM++ distribution: the ﬁve coloured regions
between the dashed and solid black lines show the indi-
vidual contribution from each of the S1, S2, Retrograde,
Prograde, and Low Energy categories. The lower panels
in Fig. 5 emphasise the range of velocities to which each
category contributes. The enhanced radial anisotropy of
the SHM++ due to the Sausage is the reason that the
vR distribution (left panel) is wider and shorter than the
other distributions.
The S1 stream and the Retrograde Shards at large neg-
ative vφ are interesting as they will become more promi-
nent when boosted into the Earth’s frame. Given that
the Earth moves with vφ ∼250 km s−1, S1 and the Ret-
rograde Shards blow into the Solar System with a large
vφ ∼550
km s−1.
Some of the phenomenology asso-
ciated with the S1 stream has already been studied in
Refs. [78, 102, 103].
The S2 steam and the Prograde Shards are interest-
ing because they have a relatively large positive vφ ∼
200
km s−1 meaning they almost corotate with the
Earth. Corotating DM will have much lower speeds when
boosted to the Earth’s frame. While many methods of
detecting DM are more sensitive to the high speed tail,
axion haloscopes are notable because the speed distribu-
tion at low speeds can also give rise to distinctive exper-
imental signals. Also important is the large negative vz
of S2. This behaviour can be seen in Fig. 4 (middle right
panel), which showed that S2 passes through the Milky
Way disk from above. This means that S2, unlike S1,
is highly misaligned from the expected orientation of the
DM wind. It will therefore also be interesting from the
perspective of directional and time dependent searches
for DM.

DARK MATTER SPEED DISTRIBUTION
AND FLUX ON EARTH
When observed on Earth, incoming DM particles are
boosted from the galactic frame in which we have been
working until now, into the lab frame.
The lab-frame
velocity distribution is
flab(v) = fgal(v + v⊙+ v⊕)
(9)
where v⊙= (11.1, v0 + 12.24, 7.25) km s−1 is the sum of
the local standard of rest and the peculiar velocity of
the Sun [94, 118], and v⊕is the Earth’s velocity around
the Sun (we will neglect the Earth’s daily rotation). We
will include the time dependence of v⊕when we discuss
modulation signals in Sec. VII A. Until that section, the

Sec. IV A. For reference, the SHM++ distribution is shown
as a dashed black line.
The grey and coloured lines show
the total speed distribution and individual contribution from
each category (S1, S2, Retrograde, Prograde and Low Energy)
obtained when the weightings of each category are selected
randomly (such that ξtot = 10%). We see that the peak of
the distribution (around 300 km s−1) can be changed by S2
and the Prograde category while the high speed tail can be
modiﬁed by S1 or the Retrograde Shards.
time dependence of the Earth’s motion will not impact
our results, so we ﬁx v⊕= (29.4, −0.11, 5.90) km s−1,
the value on March 9, which gives a speed distribution
equivalent to the time averaged result.
A.
Speed distribution
Figure 6 shows the DM speed distribution in the lab
frame.
The black solid line shows the speed distribu-
tion, flab(v), that is obtained when ξtot = 10% and the
components are individually weighted according to the
prescription described in Sec. IV A. The black dashed
line shows the speed distribution from the SHM++ model
(equivalent to setting ξtot = 0).
The eﬀect of S1, S2
and the Retrograde structures are particularly apparent,
as they enhance the distribution around 280 km s−1 and
550 km s−1.
To explore the possible eﬀects of diﬀerent weightings,
we have also shown the distributions that are obtained
when the weights for the ﬁve substructure categories are
drawn randomly from a uniform distribution, while still
adding up to ξtot = 10%. The eﬀect on the overall speed
distribution is shown by the thin grey lines in Fig. 6,
while the contribution from the individual categories are
shown by the coloured lines at the bottom of the ﬁg-
ure. Some care should be taken when interpreting the
envelope of the grey lines since, for example, if the con-
tribution from S2 is maximal (ξS2 = 10%) so that the
peak at ∼280 km s−1 takes the largest value, then there
will be no peak at ∼550 km s−1 as the contribution from
the other categories is zero. However, this exercise is use-
ful as it highlights the general features that can emerge
and that are captured by our benchmark weighting pre-
scription; namely, the peak of the distribution (around
300 km s−1) can be changed depending on the weighting
given to S2 and the Retrograde categories, and the high
speed tail can be modiﬁed either by S1 or the Retrograde
categories. The eﬀects from the Prograde and Low En-
ergy categories are less pronounced in comparison to S1,
S2 and the Retrograde Dark Shards, but in general lead
to a broad enhancement for speeds v ≲400 km s−1.
B.
Directional dependence of the ﬂux
In addition to the speed distribution, the directional-
ity of the DM signal is important for many experiments.
The prediction of an anisotropic ﬂux of DM is a generic
result that follows from our motion through the (essen-
tially) non-rotating DM halo. For the simplest models
in which the velocity ellipsoid (in the galactic frame) is
centred at v = 0 and there is no overall rotation, the DM
ﬂux on Earth peaks in the direction −vlab. This holds
for both the isotropic part of the halo and the Sausage,
so the ﬂux is largest in the direction −vlab [72], towards
the constellation Cygnus. For substructures, this need
not be the case.
Since they may be characterised by
nonzero average velocity in the rest frame of the Galaxy
[cf. Eq.(8)], their lab-frame distribution will not neces-
sarily align with Cygnus.
Figure 7 shows the angular distribution of the DM ﬂux
as seen on Earth. This is calculated by integrating along
the line of sight ˆxlos,

where ρ0 = 0.55 GeV/cm3 [72] is the local DM density.
For this result and several others, we display angular
distributions in terms of galactic longitude and latitude,
(l, b), which are mapped with a Mollweide projection.
The left panel shows the ﬂux for the SHM++ with no
substructure (i.e., ξtot = 0). The distribution is smooth
and peaks towards Cygnus, but the contours of equal ﬂux
are not quite symmetric owing to the anisotropy brought
by the Sausage. The right panel shows the ﬂux when the
Dark Shards contribute ξtot = 10% of ρ0. Compared to
the left panel, we see that the peak of the ﬂux is now oﬀset
slightly from the direction of Cygnus, the maximum ﬂux
is much higher, and there are multiple peaks rather than
one, with the most noticeable one appearing towards high
galactic latitudes, b ≈+70◦.

FIG. 7. Angular dependence of the DM ﬂux on Earth, in terms of galactic longitude and latitude. The galactic plane is shown
by the white horizontal line and the Cygnus constellation in red. The left panel shows the ﬂux for the SHM++, while the right
panel shows the ﬂux when the Dark Shards contribute ξtot = 10%. In contrast to the SHM++, which peaks in the direction of
Cygnus and has a smooth distribution, the eﬀect of the Dark Shards on the distribution is to enhance and slightly oﬀset the
peak towards Cygnus and to generate multiple subsidiary peaks.
To understand the origin of these diﬀerences, it is help-
ful to view the angular distributions of the individual cat-
egories. These are shown in Fig. 8, where we have drawn
the 68% and 95% contours around each category’s line-of-
sight ﬂux distribution. The S1 stream almost aligns with
Cygnus because of its relatively small vR and vz (cf. Ta-
ble II). The Retrograde Shards are also focused more
strongly around Cygnus as the boost into the Earth-
frame increases the size of their vφ components relative to
vR and vz. This is reversed in the case of the Prograde
category, whose ﬂux becomes spread over much wider
angles relative to Cygnus. Finally, the prominent high
latitude feature from Fig. 7 can clearly now be identiﬁed
with S2. This should not be surprising given the large
negative vz component that we observed in Fig. 5, indi-
cating the presence of a component incoming from high
latitudes. For visibility, we have not shown the Low En-
ergy Shards which, similarly to the Prograde structures,
are spread over much wider range of angles.
VI.
AXION SEARCHES
The changes we have made to the lab-frame speed dis-
tribution are relevant for all experiments searching for
DM, but particularly axion searches. Since axions are
so light, to make up the nonrelativistic galactic DM the
axion ﬁeld would need to have enormous, macroscopic oc-
cupation numbers per quantum state. As such the natu-
ral description of axionic DM is of an oscillating classical
ﬁeld, which for small enough time and length-scales can

region, from dark green to dark red corresponding to the
range of values 0% ≤ξtot ≤10%. We also show the indi-
vidual weighted contribution from each Shard category when
ξtot = 10%. S1 and the Retrograde Shards contribute to a
bump at higher frequencies but S2 sharpens the peak of the
distribution. To emphasise this, the pink dashed line shows
the lineshape under an alternative weighting scheme in which
half of ξtot = 10% is assigned to S2.
This distribution is
notably sharper and would enhance the sensitivity of axion
haloscopes to the coupling gaγ.
ral variation in frequency and phase will eﬀectively map
out the DM speed distribution when observed for long
enough. Haloscope designs generically involve the mon-
itoring of some electromagnetic response to a(t).
The
spectral density of photons (usually the Fourier trans-
form of time series data) measured over a time t ≫τa is
proportional to flab(v) up to stochastic variations. Hence
the signal lineshape in axion haloscopes is very sensitive
to the DM halo model.
The central problem in detecting the axion however
is that we do not know the frequency, ω ≃ma(1 +
v2/2) at which the electromagnetic response to the ax-
ion ﬁeld should be monitored.
To search for this fre-
quency, haloscopes either enforce a resonance or con-
structive interference condition for a signal oscillating at
∼ma (as in e.g., ADMX [121, 122], MADMAX [123,
124], HAYSTAC [125–128], CULTASK [129–131], OR-
GAN [132, 133], KLASH [134] and RADES [135]), or are
sensitive to a wide bandwidth of frequencies simultane-
ously (e.g., ABRACADABRA [136–138], BEAST [139]
and DM-Radio [140]). See Ref. [141] for a recent review.
For most of the haloscope techniques discussed, the
spectral density of axion-induced photons is proportional
to the speed distribution, up to a change of variables
between frequency and speed (see e.g., Refs. [37, 142])
dP
dω = πH(ω) g2
aγ ρ0 flab(ω) ,
(12)
where gaγ is the axion-photon coupling on which the ex-
periment will set a limit. We use H(ω) to note that a
haloscope will often have an underlying frequency de-
pendence, but over the small width of the axion signal
this is usually going to be ﬂat. The relevant object for
us is,
flab(ω) = dv
dω flab(v) .
(13)
We show flab(ω) as a function of frequency in Fig. 9.
The coloured shading from dark green to dark red in-
dicates the changes to the lineshape as ξtot is increased
from 0% (the SHM++) to 10%. The contribution from
the ﬁve Dark Shard categories when ξtot = 10% and the
equal weighting scheme (cf. Sec. IV A) is shown at the
bottom of the ﬁgure.
We see similar eﬀects to those
shown in Fig. 6, but with an important diﬀerence: since
ω ∝v2, the lineshape is more concentrated around low
values than the speed distribution shown earlier. In fact,
the peak itself is notably sharper relative to the SHM++
due to S2. However overall, the lineshape ends up being
slightly wider due to the presence of S1 and the Retro-
grade Shards at higher frequencies. The eﬀect from S1
was considered in detail in Ref. [78], including also the
dependence on the S1 velocity dispersion.
In both resonant and broadband haloscopes, the sen-
sitivity to gaγ is dependent upon how prominently the
signal can show up over the experiment’s noise ﬂoor.
In a generic statistical methodology, this means that
the sensitivity of an axion experiment scales as gaγ ∼
(
R
f(ω)2 dω)−1/4. Signals that are sharper in frequency
are more prominent over white noise and hence easier to
detect. Since the eﬀect from S2 appears at the peak of
the lineshape, if the local DM density had a larger con-
tribution from S2, we would expect an even sharper line-
shape. To demonstrate this explicitly, the pink dashed
line in Fig. 9 shows the lineshape when half of ξtot = 10%
is weighted towards S2 (as opposed to a ﬁfth under the
equal weighting scheme).
This distribution is notably
sharper and further increases the sensitivity of axion
haloscopes to the coupling gaγ.
We calculate a 2%–5% enhancement in the experimen-
tal sensitivity relative to the SHM++ when the fraction
of ρ0 attributed to S2 is between 5%–10%. The precise
enhancement depends sensitively on S2’s velocity disper-
sion, which — since there is a contamination from outly-
ing stars—may be overestimated. To obtain more robust
results from axion haloscopes, it is therefore important
that the properties of S2 are characterised precisely. For
instance, if the S2 velocity dispersion is reduced by 20%
then we would expect a 10%–20% enhancement in axion
sensitivity. Although this is a modest enhancement, as

15
the axion mass scan rate to reach a given coupling scales
as g−4
aγ , it implies a reduction in the running times for
reaching the sought-after DFSZ axion models [143, 144].
In fact the S2 enhancement is close to the enhancement
brought about by the “N-body inspired” line shape often
used in the presentation of results from ADMX (see e.g.
Ref. [145]). This enhancement is modulo the increase in
the local density between that model and the SHM.
Once the axion has been detected, it becomes more
straightforward to measure the properties of streams.
Since there will no longer be any need to scan the axion
mass parameter, the experiment can reach a high statis-
tics regime very rapidly and the signal will continue to
amplify above the noise.
For example, for ADMX to
achieve DFSZ-sensitivity with signal-to-noise S/N = 5
over a window of 20 µeV in 5 years, around ∼106 mass
bins would be needed, corresponding to a typical time
of T ∼100 s on each bin. To subsequently measure an-
other peak in the spectrum which has an amplitude that
was some fraction of the main signal, the noise would
need to be reduced by that same ratio. Keeping the fre-
quency resolution the same, the amplitude of white noise
will scale with 1/
√
t. The S2 peak is around a fraction
0.23(ξS2/5%) of the height of the main peak. Therefore
we can estimate that around (100 s/0.23)2 = 52 hours
would be required to measure S2 to the same S/N as
required to initially detect the DFSZ axion. From this
measurement, the density of S2 relative to the rest of
the halo can be determined from the height of the peak,
as well as the lab frame speed and dispersion along one
dimension from its central frequency and width.
Fur-
thermore, from the phase and amplitude of the annual
modulation of S2, the rest of the 3-dimensional disper-
sion and velocity could be measurable on the timescale
of a year. This procedure is discussed in much greater
detail in Ref. [102]. A postdiscovery haloscope can be
considered to be a very high-statistics instrument due to
the alleviation of the need to scan over the axion mass.
A.
Dependence on the dark matter direction
Some classes of axion experiments are also sensitive to
the directionality of the DM ﬂux. The CASPEr experi-
ments for example [146] utilise spin-precession to detect
the nuclear coupling of ultralight axions.
The generic
Hamiltonian that CASPEr is sensitive to has the form
H ∼g IN · D, where IN represents the polarised nuclear
spins and D is an eﬀective ﬁeld. The CASPEr-wind [147]
experiment assumes that the eﬀective ﬁeld is given by the
spatial gradient of the axion ﬁeld,
Da(t) ≃−
p
2ρ(t) sin(mat + φ) v(t) .
(14)
In this case, the Hamiltonian is proportional to the scalar
product of the axion velocity and the polarised nuclear
spin so the experiments are most sensitive when these
two vectors are aligned.

scope QUAX [148–150] also measures an eﬀective ﬁeld
dependent on the axionic gradient.
One typically assumes a smooth DM ﬂux that on av-
erage points in the direction of Cygnus ˆxCyg. Yet we saw
in Fig. 8 that one of the eﬀects of the Dark Shards was to
displace slightly the peak of the DM ﬂux from the direc-
tion of Cygnus and to introduce a prominent high lati-
tude component due to S2. This means that the gradient
of the axion ﬁeld as it varies over the coherence length
and time will therefore be more likely to point at large
angles away from Cygnus than under the assumption of
the SHM. This will modify the daily modulation [102],
and may potentially aﬀect experimental sensitivities for
CASPEr and QUAX. Similar arguments may also apply
to experimental methods involving atomic clocks and co-
magnetometers that are searching for a wider class of
ultralight particles [151–153]. We leave a more detailed
investigation of this subject to future work.
VII.
NUCLEAR RECOIL SIGNALS
Many DM experiments currently operating search for
signals from WIMP-like particles from the Milky Way
halo scattering with nuclei through a wide variety of in-
teractions [154–156]. For two-to-two scattering processes

16
(which could be elastic or inelastic [157–160]), the time-
averaged rate R of nuclear scatters as a function of the
energy of the recoiling nucleus Er is found by integrating
the ﬂux of DM,

(15)
Here, mN is the target nucleus mass, mχ is the WIMP-
like particle mass, vmin is the minimum DM speed that
can induce a recoil of energy Er, and σT is the DM–
nucleus scattering cross section, which can depend on v
and Er.
It is commonplace to extract all factors of v from
the cross section and absorb them into the halo inte-
gral, a single object that encapsulates all of the veloc-
ity distribution dependence. For the canonical leading
order spin independent (SI) and spin dependent (SD)
DM–nucleus interactions, the diﬀerential cross section is
inversely proportional to the square of the DM speed,
dσT /dEr ∝v−2. In this case, the relevant halo integral
is the mean inverse speed above vmin,
g(vmin) =

(16)
To show the impact of the Dark Shards on observable
signals, we will consider the most familiar one: spin inde-

and neutrons. In this case,

Here, A is the atomic number, µp is the DM-proton re-
duced mass, F(Er) is the nuclear form factor and σSI

is the SI DM-proton scattering cross section.
We dis-
play the diﬀerential event rate in Fig. 10 for an experi-
ment with a xenon target (applicable for LZ [161], Pan-
daX [162], XENON [163] and XMASS [164, 165]). The
coloured shading from dark green to dark red indicates
the changes to the diﬀerential rate as ξtot is increased
from 0% (the SHM++) to 20%. The coloured regions at
the bottom of Fig. 10 show the contribution from the in-
dividual Dark Shards. The S1 stream and most of the
Retrograde Shards have the largest impact on the diﬀer-
ential rate. S2 on the other hand, while prominent in
other signals, is much less important here.
We ﬁnd that the impact of the Dark Shards on dR/dEr
is small, though this is not wholly unexpected. Xenon
detectors, and nuclear recoil experiments in general, are
poor at distinguishing features in the velocity distribu-
tion. Since only the recoil energy Er is measured while
information about the recoil direction is lost, DM veloc-
ities cannot be reconstructed.
Mathematically, this is
encoded in the fact that the recoil rate is proportional to
an integral over speeds, g(vmin), rather than the speed
distribution explicitly as in the case of the axion-induced
photon spectral density (cf. Eqs. (12) and (15)).

and a spin independent interaction. The shaded band indi-
cates the change in the modulation amplitude as the value of
ξtot increases from 0 to 10% (green to red). The modulation
amplitude decreases as ξtot increases. The coloured lines show
the modulation amplitude from the individual Dark Shards
categories assuming (for visibility) that each contributes 20%
of the local DM density. S2 is the most distinctive as its phase
is reversed over most of this range of energies and its modula-
tion amplitude is larger compared to the other Dark Shards.
The dashed lines show the modulation amplitude when grav-
itational focusing is not included. They lie very close to the
solid lines indicating that the eﬀect on this measure of the
modulation amplitude is small.
We displayed dR/dEr for a 20 GeV WIMP-like particle
here. For masses of this size scattering with xenon, the
spectrum should in fact be the most sensitive to changes
to f(v) (see Ref. [78] for a quantitative discussion). How-
ever despite this choice, and even increasing the max-
imum value of ξtot to 20% to make the changes more
noticeable, they remain small.
As most of the changes in the recoil spectrum are
brought about by S1, the phenomenology of the Dark
Shards as a departure from the SHM will be very sim-
ilar to the case studied in Ref. [78].
Following what
was concluded then, we concur that the impact of the
Dark Shards will be minor for nuclear recoil based ex-
periments unless S1 and the Retrograde shards are par-
ticularly prominent in the DM of the ex situ halo.

FIG. 12. The modulation of the integrated event rate in two ionisation energy bins of 1–3 and 1–6 keV (top and bottom panels
in each column respectively). The WIMP particle model is kept the same from the previous Figure. The left-hand column
shows the calculation ignoring gravitational focusing whereas the middle column shows the nonsinusoidal modiﬁcations that it
gives rise to when it is included. The right-hand column shows each Dark Shard contribution individually. For visibility here
we have suppressed the S2 modulation by a factor of 10 as it is by far the dominant contribution for this DM mass and for
these energy bins.
by the Earth’s motion around the Sun is the primary sig-
nal [107, 166]. As the velocity distributions of the Dark
Shards do not have an average velocity v = 0 in the
galactic rest frame, they will distort modulation signals
relative to the rest of the halo that does have zero average
velocity.
To obtain the modulation signal for a detector in a lab-
oratory on Earth, flab(v, t), two eﬀects have to be taken
into account. The ﬁrst is due to the time dependence in
the Earth velocity, which can be written as,
v⊕(t) = v⊕

v⊕= 29.79 km s−1 is the average speed, and
ˆϵ1 = (0.9941, 0.1088, 0.0042) ,

ˆϵ2 = (−0.0504, 0.4946, −0.8677) ,
(20)
are orthogonal unit vectors for the Earth’s orbital plane
expressed in galactic coordinates. For brevity, we have
suppressed the corrections from the eccentricity of the
Earth’s orbit, but they are included up to second order
in our numerical results.
The second eﬀect,
known as gravitational focus-
ing [167–172], takes into account the Sun’s gravitational
inﬂuence on DM particles in the Solar System. For par-
ticles blowing through the Solar System, the Sun acts as
a gravitational lens that enhances the ﬂux in March rel-
ative to half a year later in September [167, 170]. This
eﬀect is out of phase with the annual modulation induced
by the Earth’s rotation v⊕(t), which enhances the ﬂux
in June and reduces it in December [166]. Ultimately,
gravitational focusing is negligible for time-averaged sig-
nals [169], however it can be an important modiﬁcation
to consider for experiments that make use of timing in-
formation [170].
When both eﬀects are included, the time-dependent
lab-frame velocity distribution is
flab(v, t) = fgal(v⊙+ v∞[v⊕(t) + v]) .
(21)
The function v∞[v] gives the velocity that a particle
would have had at inﬁnity to have fallen into the So-

18
lar System with the velocity v. Reference [169] showed
that it can be expressed as
v∞[v] = v2

In the limit that M⊙→0, v∞[v] →v and we recover
the usual result in the absence of gravitational focusing.
To highlight the impact of the Dark Shards on mod-
ulation signals, we focus on the best known experi-
ments searching for it; namely DAMA/LIBRA [173,
174], together with the experiments trying to repli-
cate DAMA/LIBRA’s result by employing similar tech-
nology and NaI(Tl) crystals.
These include DM-
Ice [175], KIMS [176], SABRE [177], Cosine [178, 179]
and ANAIS [180, 181]. We do not provide a detailed ﬁt
to the DAMA/LIBRA data but instead focus our dis-
cussion on the general features introduced by the Dark
Shards.
For more than a decade, the DAMA/LIBRA ex-
periment has measured a persistent annually modu-
lating signal above known backgrounds (however, see
Refs. [182, 183]) with a signiﬁcance in excess of 9σ [174].
Although there is diﬃculty in explaining this signal with
galactic DM while remaining consistent with other ex-
periments, the signal does have many of the properties
expected from galactic DM. ANAIS [180, 181] and Co-
sine [178, 179] have released ﬁrst results and do not ob-
serve a statistically signiﬁcant modulation, but they still
require a few years of exposure to deﬁnitively test the
DAMA/LIBRA result.
To calculate the observable modulation signal for
DAMA/LIBRA and the other NaI(Tl)-based experi-
ments, we need to convert from the recoil energy Er to
the ionisation energy Eee. They are related by Eee =
QEr, where Q is the quenching factor. DAMA/LIBRA
have historically used the values Q = 0.3 and 0.09 for
Na and I respectively [184], but we use the lower value
Q = 0.1 for Na to reﬂect more recent measurements [185].
To account for the ﬁnite PMT resolution, we convolve
the rate by a Gaussian energy-dependent energy res-
olution with width, σE(Eee) = α√Eee + βEee, where
α = 0.448 √keVee and β = 9.1 × 10−3.
In Fig. 11, we show one particular measure of mod-
ulation amplitude as a function of ionisation energy for
a 50 GeV particle.
The modulation amplitude is cal-
culated by taking the diﬀerence of the diﬀerential recoil
event rate on June 2 and Dec 2 (the days when the diﬀer-
ential rate is maximised/minimised in the Standard Halo
Model). This amplitude exhibits the well-known phase
ﬂip, here at Eee ≈1.3 keVee. As in previous ﬁgures, the
eﬀect of the Dark Shards is indicated by the shading in
Fig. 11. We see that as ξtot increases (i.e., moves from
green to red), the amplitude of the modulation amplitude
decreases in the window between 1 and 3 keVee and in
the grey shaded region below 1 keVee (which is below the
energy threshold set for DAMA/LIBRA phase-2).
The coloured lines in Fig. 11 show the modulation am-
plitude for the individual Dark Shard categories.
The
coloured lines make it clear that S2 leads to the most
signiﬁcant change. S2 has a large modulation amplitude
and the phase ﬂip is reversed relative to the other Dark
Shards and the smooth components of the halo: for S2
the rate in June is smaller at low energies while the rate
in December is larger at higher energies. The dominant
direction of S2 is towards negative galactic-Z (cf. Fig. 4)
so the scattering rate at higher energies will be largest
when the Earth’s velocity is moving fastest in positive Z.
For the Earth’s orbit, this occurs in December, explain-
ing the behaviour in Fig. 11. None of the other Dark
Shards move on orbits so distinct from the smooth halo
component (cf. Fig. 7), which is why their modulation
behaviour is similar to the smooth halo component.
The dashed and solid lines in Fig. 11 show the modula-
tion amplitude without and with gravitational focusing.
The dashed and solid lines largely overlap showing that
the eﬀect of focusing on this measure of the modulation
is small.
To make the impact of gravitational focusing more ap-
parent, we show in Fig. 12 the time-dependent compo-
nent of the rate over the course of one year for the same
DM mass and cross section used in Fig. 11. The rate
versus time in Fig. 12 has been integrated over two re-
coil energy bins of 1–3 and 1–6 keVee (aligning with re-
sults often presented by DAMA/LIBRA). The left-most
panels show the rates without focusing, which are clean
sinusoidals. The main eﬀect of the Dark Shards is to re-
duce the modulation amplitude, whereas the day when
the rate is maximum (indicated by the dashed vertical
lines) is changed only slightly. The middle panels show
the rates when gravitational focusing is included. For the
1–3 keVee bin in particular, the eﬀect is large: the peak
day shifts by more than one month and the sinusoid is
distorted. The right panels show the eﬀects from the in-
dividual Dark Shards. The dominant component causing
this change is S2 (in fact the modulation of S2 has been
suppressed by a factor of ten in the right-hand column of
Fig. 12 so that all categories are visible). The structure of
S2 is disjoint in velocity space, with a prominent wrap at
negative vertical velocity and a subsidiary wrap at posi-
tive velocity. This is also discernible in the middle panel
of Fig. 4. The gravitational focusing of the annual modu-
lation signal is particularly aﬀected by the orientation of
the subsidiary wrap, (S2b in Table II) which roughly lies
in the plane of the ecliptic. This is an intriguing result,
however some doubt has been cast in the literature [77]
as to whether this additional wrap is truly a component
of S2, or merely a collection of stars lying at a coinciding
with S2 in action space. Ongoing work will address this
issue in the near-future.
In light of this result, we reiterate the conclusion of
Sec. VI that the S2 stream is surprisingly important for
some DM signals and deserves to be studied in much
greater depth. Furthermore, the comparison of Figs. 12
and 11 inspires us to urge that data from annual modula-

tion searches be analysed in a framework that allows for
higher harmonics (this requires of course that energy and
timing information on recoil events are made available).
Many of the interesting eﬀects displayed in Fig. 12 are
missed when calculating a modulation amplitude which
assumes a single sinusoid with a ﬁxed peak day. Whereas
they could be picked up by a Fourier mode decomposi-
tion. We have left an exercise in such a calculation in the
GitHub repository attached to this paper [79], but in the
interest of keeping this section concise we do not discuss
this further.
B.
Directional signals
We showed in Fig. 7 that the angular dependence of the
DM ﬂux exhibits marked diﬀerences in our model com-
pared with the expectation from a smooth halo. Many
classes of experiment searching for DM are sensitive to
this directional dependence of the underlying signal, as
already discussed in the context of axions in Sec. VI A.
Now we turn to the directional dependence of nuclear
recoil signals.
The detection of the directionality of nuclear recoils is a
promising technique for the discovery of WIMP-like par-
ticles [186]. The galactic anisotropy of the DM ﬂux can-
not be mimicked by any known terrestrial [187] or cosmic
background [188], including solar neutrinos [189, 190].
However, measuring the recoil direction for keV-scale re-
coil tracks is experimentally challenging.
In liquid or
solid state detectors, recoil tracks are typically O(nm),
whereas in gas they can be O(mm).
This means that
a directional detector requires either a readout method
with high spatial resolution (such as x-ray imaging of nu-
clear emulsions [191, 192]) or detection media with very
low pressure. We focus on the latter technique here since
low-pressure gas time projection chambers (TPCs) have
seen many more years of consistent progress in their ex-
perimental realisation, see e.g., Refs. [193–201]). Most
recently the design for a tonne-scale network of direc-
tional gas-TPCs named Cygnus [202] has been put for-
ward. The preliminary design study for Cygnus is for a
gaseous time projection chamber with a total active vol-
ume between 1000 m3 and 100,000 m3, using a He:SF6
gas mixture at atmospheric pressure [202].

around single directions, their recoil distributions appear as rings with recoil energy-dependent angular radii. The Prograde,
Retrograde and Low Energy categories have multiple components so lead to more complex topologies. Lower energy recoils are
associated with larger angles away from Cygnus; recoil directions from Low Energy and Prograde Shards in particular extend

This formula is similar to the non-directional rate for spin

and ˆf(vmin, ˆq, t) instead of g(vmin, t). This is the “Radon

transform” of the velocity distribution [203, 204]:
ˆf(vmin, ˆq, t) =
Z
δ (v · ˆq −vmin) flab(v, t) d3v .
(24)
We show the angular recoil distributions integrated over
three recoil energies bins in Fig. 13. We assume spin in-
dependent scattering with mχ = 100 GeV and a ﬂuorine
target, and apply a Gaussian angular resolution of 20◦.
We compare the recoil maps from the SHM++ which con-
tains only the smooth components of the halo (top row),
the halo model with Dark Shards where ξtot = 10% (mid-
dle row), and the recoil maps from the Dark Shards alone
(bottom row). Figure 14 can be used to observe each of
the categories individually for comparison.
Over all energy bins in Fig. 13, the rate peaks in the
forward half of the sky. One interesting and prominent
feature in the top row (where ξtot = 0) is that the rate
has two maxima at positive and negative galactic lati-
tudes of ±60◦. This is due to the inﬂuence of the radially
anisotropic Sausage. The intuition behind this feature is
subtle, but can be thought of as a manifestation of the
ring feature originally discussed in the context of direc-
tional detectors in Ref. [205]. The ring feature shows up
at low recoil energies for large DM masses and isotropic
halo models.
In a certain range of low energies, the
Radon transform is not maximised at ˆq = −ˆvlab as it
is at high energies, but rather at an energy-dependent
angle away from vlab. This leads to recoils being focused
along a ring around vlab.
For the radially anisotropic
Sausage there are instead two rings centred at wide an-
gles away from vlab. The centres of the rings are closer to
the galactic radial axis but do not precisely align with it
because of the boost into the lab frame. When we calcu-
late the recoil map for the Sausage across the sky, the rate
is maximised when the two rings intersect. Because the
ring centres are equal angular distances away from vlab
in galactic longitude, the intersections occur at galactic
latitudes above and below vlab, hence the position of the
two stars in the top panel of Fig. 13.
The inﬂuence of the Shards when included as a part
of this distribution is to distort the symmetry of these
two maxima about the galactic plane. The Shards also
present several interesting eﬀects when comparing the
distribution across the sky between bins in recoil energy.
Each Shard presents its own ring feature centred around
the direction of its velocity. Kinematically a nuclear re-
coil will scatter at smaller angles away from the direction
of the impinging particle, and in this context we see that
as the angular radii of each ring becoming smaller as re-
coil energy increases. This can be seen in the panels for
the S1 and S2 streams in Fig. 14.
The impact of the Shards is notable departures from
the central assumption in directional detection, which
is that the ﬂux is rotationally symmetric around the
Cygnus constellation.
The overall forward-backward
anisotropy is however largely preserve, despite the fact
that some of the Low Energy and Prograde categories
have sizeable event rates in the backward half of the
sky (see Fig. 14). If the anisotropy were reduced, this
could harm the powerful discovery capabilities of direc-
tional WIMP searches [186], so it is comforting that this
is not the case. The anisotropy in fact seems to be quite
strongly peaked in the forward direction when we go to
the higher energy bins. This is largely because the Shards
that have the largest angles away from Cygnus do not
have recoils scattering at higher energies. It is only the
retrograde substructures that align with Cygnus that are
still present at high recoil energies and therefore add to
the anisotropy.
The sum of all the Dark Shards would likely require
many hundreds of events to distinguish from a smooth
DM halo distribution.
Nevertheless, in the context of
WIMP-like dark matter, the measurement of the direc-
tionality of nuclear recoils would likely be the only feasi-
ble way to probe this part of the DM halo directly. Fewer
events would be required in the cases of single streams
such as S1 and S2, which lead to much more striking
changes to the expected directional signals. To quantify
these statements, we can estimate the number of events
required in a benchmark directional detector to measure
a 3σ dipole anisotropy in the rates, A12 = R1/R2, be-
tween two hemispheres, labelled “1” and “2”:
Naniso ≈

3 R1 + R2
R1 −R2
2
.
(25)
The formula arises from simply assuming that the con-
trast in the rates, proportional to (R1 −R2), between the
two hemispheres should be greater than a 3σ deviation in
the total number, proportional to 3√R1 + R2, in order
to measure the anisotropy.
We assume two orthogonal pairs of hemispheres, a
“forward-backward” pair, which align with vlab, and an
“up-down” pair, which is aligned 90◦from the forward-
backward hemispheres, and approximately align with
the Galactic North Pole.
Taking a typical directional
detector model assuming
19F recoils above a thresh-
old of 3 keV, under the SHM++ the forward-backward
anisotropy is on the order of Afw ∼5 (requiring around
20 events to detect) and there is no up-down anisotropy,
so Aud = 1. We ﬁnd that over all detectable values of
the DM mass, the Dark Shards in total give a negligible
change to both Afw and Aud. So the forward-backward
dipole is largely preserved, but the slight up-down asym-
metry caused by the Dark Shards would need in excess
of Naniso ≃1000 events for ξtot ≲50%.
Isolating S1 and S2, we ﬁnd that they give rise to op-
posing eﬀects, which reﬂect their perpendicular veloci-
ties. S1 enhances the forward-backward anisotropy, ap-
proximately linearly with ξS1, whereas S2 enhances the
up-down anisotropy with ξS2. For 10% of the local den-
sity in S1, we ﬁnd that Afw is enhanced such that it would
reduce the required number of events to detect it from 20
to 17; Aud is essentially unchanged. For 10% in S2, the
required number of events to detect Afw is only mildly
increased from 20 to 23, but the up-down anisotropy is in-
creased dramatically and is detectable with Naniso ≃250

22
events as opposed to 1000.
While these numbers are
large, it is worth pointing out that in some ways they
reﬂect upper limits. This simple procedure of calculat-
ing dipole anisotropies along two directions represents a
model-independent test that could be performed on di-
rectional data but it does not optimise for the particular
direction of a given stream, or include the correlation
with recoil energy information. A full likelihood-based
analysis that includes this additional information would
therefore require fewer events than we have estimated
here.

SUMMARY
Thanks to Gaia, the six-dimensional view of our lo-
cal stellar halo is more extensive than ever before. The
distributions of stars in action space are revealing much
about the recent accretion history of the Milky Way. We
have studied the properties of the substructure found in
this distribution due to accretion during the ex situ phase
of the Milky Way’s formation. Substructure passing close
by the Earth has implications for a wide range of exper-
iments looking for DM.
The sample of stars we study here is derived from a
cross-matching of the SDSS and Gaia catalogues. Tak-
ing inspiration from the kinematic structure of the stel-
lar halo in this sample, we began by describing the two
smooth components present in the dark halo: a roundish,
isotropic part and a radially anisotropic “sausage”-
shaped part. To this, we then introduced substructures.
We considered in particular the large collection of action
space substructures, or “Shards”, present in the Gaia-
SDSS stellar halo sample. We individually modelled the
Shards, identiﬁed those passing closest to the solar neigh-
bourhood, and then used the models to build an approx-
imate description for the collection of their DM counter-
parts: the “Dark Shards”. We organised the Dark Shards
into ﬁve categories in terms of overall signiﬁcance and
properties: S1, S2, Retrograde, Prograde, and Low En-
ergy. When accounting for the Dark Shards, the resulting
DM velocity and speed distributions contain notable non-
Gaussian departures from their conventionally assumed
Gaussian and Maxwellian forms (see Figs. 5 and 6).
Of the long list of Shards, we highlight the S1 and
S2 streams as the most important ones nearby. They are
present at highest signiﬁcance in action space [12, 26] and
have the most important experimental implications. S1
has a very high Earth-frame speed of ∼550 km s−1, so is
important for signals which are sensitive to the tail of the
speed distribution. Several other substructures on retro-
grade orbits lead to phenomenologically similar eﬀects.
These may be observable in nuclear recoil searches for
WIMPs, if their representation in the local DM density
is relatively large [78].
S2 gives rise to a more complex array of new eﬀects.
Unlike S1, it has not been studied until now; despite the
fact that it also passes through the solar neighbourhood
and is of roughly equal prominence as an action space
substructure inGaia-SDSS. S2 moves on a prograde, but
highly polar orbit, so its DM enters the Milky Way disk
from above. In the Earth frame, it contributes near the
peak of the speed distribution at around 300 km s−1 (see
Fig. 9). Being present at lower speeds than S1 means that
it can potentially impact signals in axion haloscopes in a
much more remarkable way. In fact there are important
implications for the very detection of the axion. Since
sharper peaks show up more strongly over thermal noise,
S2 is positioned at the ideal frequency to enhance the
sensitivity of a haloscope to the axion-photon coupling.
Streams with polar orbits imply peculiar modiﬁcations
to the standard lore for time dependent signals induced
by DM. Not only does S2 (in combination with several
other Shards) shift the peak day of the annual modula-
tion of the event rate of nuclear recoils, it also causes that
modulation to become nonsinusoidal. Here, we have also
included the often-neglected (but present) eﬀect of grav-
itational focusing. Since this largely involves the modu-
lation of the low-speed tail of the speed distribution, it
is more important to take into account when considering
the S2, Prograde and Low Energy Shards. We studied
annual modulation in the context of NaI(Tl) experiments
like DAMA/LIBRA, but these broad statements apply to
the annual modulation of WIMP-like DM in general.
All of the Dark Shards have interesting and poten-
tially detectable eﬀects on angular and directional sig-
nals. Owing to the large quantity of retrograde material,
the DM ﬂux is enhanced in the direction of galactic ro-
tation (towards the Cygnus constellation). This is to the
beneﬁt of direction-sensitive experiments. However, the
Dark Shards on radial or polar orbits lead to additional
peaks in the DM ﬂux that have large angular separation
from the expected peak towards Cygnus (compare the
two panels of Fig. 7). For nuclear recoil-based experi-
ments like Cygnus that aim to measure this directional-
ity, the process of elastic scattering and the ﬁnite angular
resolution partially washes out this substructure.
But
for direction-sensitive axion searches like CASPEr and
QUAX, the modiﬁcations are complex enough to war-
rant a dedicated study.
This paper is the ﬁrst to sketch out some of the im-
plications of the abundant substructure found by Gaia.
This ﬁeld of activity is likely to become more impor-
tant with future data releases, as the characterisation of
stellar substructures will improve over the coming years.
Perhaps the most important area for future study is the
relationship between stellar substructures and their as-
sociated DM components. Despite some early progress
and speculation in the literature, this problem remains
underexplored and is ripe for further investigation.
