For over 35 years, biological scientists have come to rely on the research protocols and 
methodologies in the critically acclaimed Methods in Molecular Biology series. The series was 
the ﬁrst to introduce the step-by-step protocols approach that has become the standard in all 
biomedical protocol publishing. Each protocol is provided in readily-reproducible step-by-
step fashion, opening with an introductory overview, a list of the materials and reagents 
needed to complete the experiment, and followed by a detailed procedure that is supported 
with a helpful notes section offering tips and tricks of the trade as well as troubleshooting 
advice. These hallmark features were introduced by series editor Dr. John Walker and 
constitute the key ingredient in each and every volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology 
series. Tested and trusted, comprehensive and reliable, all protocols from the series are 
indexed in PubMed.

Dedication 
In memory of Sanjiv Sam Gambhir and Bin Shen 
What remains after people are gone are the lessons learned from their words and actions, which 
ruminate and distill in our minds, populating the standard operating procedures for our lives. 
Sam and Bin taught us many different things in very different ways, and after reﬂection, these 
are the SOPs they inspired: 
Never say no; say how 
Never quench a dream; dream big 
Never miss a chance to smile; share this with everyone around you 
Never overvalue your own time; share of yourself 
Never weigh others down; raise them up and take pride in their heights 
Never go it alone; build community to foster strength 
Never forget why we are here; be the conduit for change 
Never forget where you began; wayﬁnd for others along the same path 
Never underestimate your impact; a key moment, a few true and kind words, and a pat on the 
shoulder can inspire for a lifetime 
The lives you have touched are innumerable, your legacy immeasurable, and your kindness 
inﬁnite. In our work and in our hearts, you are far from gone.

Preface 
Medical imaging has revolutionized the way we diagnose and treat disease. In many cases, 
invasive surgical procedures prevalent at the beginning of the last century have been replaced 
by anatomical scans, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, that 
reveal whole-body anatomy in ﬁne detail. Positron emission tomography (PET) enables an 
even deeper look into health and disease by illuminating functional and molecular changes in 
the body. The ability to probe living subjects with molecular precision is not only continuing 
to change the way we can study and diagnose disease, but it is also opening up new frontiers 
in precision medicine, predicting therapy response, and the creation of theranostic agents 
with diagnostic and therapeutic duality. This volume of the Methods in Molecular Biology 
series will explore the key concepts and experimental design related to PET imaging that 
have revolutionized our understanding of human biology. The ﬁrst part focuses on recent 
advances in radiotracer probe development to enable the detection of large macromolecules 
to complicated drug-like structures. The next section describes how key physiological and 
pathophysiological processes can be interrogated and quantiﬁably measured with this imag-
ing technique. Finally, we will describe important technological developments in the ﬁeld 
which are revolutionizing the way these innovative PET probes are utilized in the clinic.

Abstract 
This protocol describes the application of cyclotron-generated [11 C]CO2 ﬁxation reactions for direct 
11 C-carboxylation reactions and [11 C]CO for 11 C-carbonylations. Herein we describe one-pot methods 
wherein the radioactive gas is ﬁrst trapped in a reaction mixture at room temperature and atmospheric 
pressure prior to the radiolabeling reactions. Such procedures are widely applicable to numerous small 
molecules to form 11 C-labeled carboxylic acids, amides, esters, ketones, oxazolidinones, carbamates, and 
ureas. The steps for 11 C-ﬁxation techniques described herein are tailored for a commercial automated 
synthesis unit and are readily adapted for routine radiopharmaceutical production. 
Key words Carbon-11, Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Carbonylation, Carboxylation

Introduction 
Carbon-11 (11 C, t1/2 = 20.4 min) is a widely used radionuclide for 
the development of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
radiotracers because of its ubiquitous composition in organic com-
pounds and small molecule drugs. 11 C-labeling is typically per-
formed 
through 
the 
robust 
chemistry 
of 
N-, 
O-, 
or 
S-11 C-methylations, via methyl iodide ([11 C]CH3I), or methyl 
triﬂate ([11 C]CH3OTf). While several PET radiopharmaceuticals 
are produced by 11 C-methylation reactions, the synthetic versatility 
of this chemistry for producing new tracers is limited to drug 
structures containing accessible methyl functionalities. Conversely, 
carbonyl groups are more common in small molecule drugs, and it 
is not surprising that major efforts have been ongoing for develop-
ing a wide scope of 11 C-ﬁxation reactions to increase the number of 
labeled drugs accessible from combinatorial libraries by generating 
11 C = O bonds [1]. 
Syntheses of positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals are gen-
erally conducted remotely to limit exposure to ionizing radiation. 
Hence, there are several commercially available synthesis units for 
11 C-chemistry, 
as 
well 
as 
various 
units 
built

herein describes the use of a speciﬁc commercial radiosynthesis 
unit, the steps and notes are applicable to other available commer-
cial units, as well as those built in-house for carbon-11 radiotracers.

Cyclotron-generated [11 C]CO2 is produced via the nuclear 
reaction 14 N(p,α)11 C by proton bombardment of a gas target con-
taining a nitrogen:oxygen mixture (>99% nitrogen). Fixation 
based on [11 C]CO2 has been traditionally restricted to labeling 
via 11 C-synthons such as Grignard and organolithium reagents, 
which have limited functional group tolerance. Recent develop-
ments in CO2-ﬁxation have allowed the use of less sensitive reac-
tions to produce 
11 C-carboxylated compounds (see [2–4] for 
extensive reviews). Particularly, the use of organic ﬁxating bases 
(e.g., DBU or BEMP) have greatly improved the solubility of 
CO2 in organic solvents, and it has facilitated direct [11 C]CO2 
ﬁxation to form 
11 C-labeled oxazolidinones, carbamates, and 
ureas [5]. Using this advancement, copper-catalyzed [11 C]CO2 
ﬁxation into organoboron [6] or organotin [7] precursors have 
also been shown to produce 11 C-carboxylic acids, which can be 
subsequently transformed into 11 C-labeled esters or amides. A 
representative intramolecular 11 C-carboxyaltion is demonstrated 
below for the radiosynthesis of [11 C]SL25.1188, a PET radiophar-
maceutical used for imaging monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) [8] 
(Fig. 1) (see Note 1). 
Historically, labeling with [11 C]CO was limited due to its low 
solubility in organic solvents. Approaches to mitigate this challenge 
include devices that recirculate the [11 C]CO, high pressure reactors 
(mini-autoclave methodology), or utility of heavy carrier gases 
(e.g., xenon) [9–12]. Trapping of [11 C]CO has been demonstrated 
at low and atmospheric pressures (see [13, 14] for comprehensive 
reviews of various techniques). Boron-based trapping of [11 C]CO 
was performed using a borane-THF complex that subsequently 
releases [11 C]CO upon heating [15]. Another approach is 
Cu-based [11 C]CO trapping using the Cu(I) scorpionate Cu 
(Tp* ), which can release [11 C]CO in the presence of the competing 
ligand PPh3 [16]. These trapping approaches are followed by vari-
ous Pd or Rh-mediated 
11 C-carbonylation reactions to form 
11 C-amides, ureas, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, carbamate 
esters, acid chlorides, and aldehydes, among other carbonyl-
containing functional groups [14]. More recently, the use of Pd 
(II)-ligand complexes to both trap the [11 C]CO and insert it has 
been demonstrated as a method to produce 11 C-amides, esters, 
carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and ketones [17, 18]. For example, a 
one-pot 11 C-aminocarbonylation is demonstrated herein to pro-
duce the N-11 C-acrylamide, [11 C]tolebrutinib [19] (Fig. 2)  (see 
Note 2).

Notes 
1. This 11 C-carboxylation reaction can also be achieved intermo-
lecularly using a suitable amine precursor, followed by addition 
of an alcohol-based building block after the formation of the 
isocyanate with POCl3 (see [20] for an example). 
2. This reaction has potential to be modiﬁed to access a variety of 
other functional groups. Esters can be prepared by replacing 
the precursor amine with an alcohol, an aldehyde was prepared 
by replacing the amine with triethylsilane, a ketone by replacing 
the amine with a tributylstannane precursor, and a carboxylic 
acid by replacing the amine with tetraethylammonium hydrox-
ide solution. Necessary reaction conditions for these scaffolds 
may need optimization [18]. 
3. All columns and traps need to be pre-conditioned prior to use 
to ensure complete removal of atmospheric gases. This is usu-
ally performed with a He ﬂush. 
4. Molecular sieves can be used to trap cyclotron-produced [11 C] 
CO2 in place of the liquid nitrogen cooled Hayesep D column. 
In this case, [11 C]CO2 is trapped on molecular sieves at room 
temperature, the column is ﬂushed with helium to remove 
target gas and nitrogenous impurities, and the [11 C]CO2 is 
released by heating the column to 350 °C under helium ﬂow. 
5. The TracerMaker™ is an automated radiosynthesis module 
equipped 
to 
handle 
all 
carbon-11 
transformations 
and

manipulations. Other modules may be appropriate or modiﬁed 
for the needs herein. 
6. All tubing on the TracerMaker™ are polytetraﬂuoroethylene 
(PTFE). 
7. Stainless steel needles are used for the TracerMaker™ reactor 
(delivery needle and vent needle). 
8. The molybdenum column needs to be conditioned after pack-
ing. With the outlet disconnected, condition under He ﬂow at 
5-10 mL/min: 100 °C for 5 min, ramp to 350 °C and hold for 
10 min, ramp to 850 °C over 10 min and hold for 5 min, ramp 
down to room temperature slowly. 
9. An Ascarite (or NaOH) column must always follow the molyb-
denum column. We have found that placing an Ascarite/Sica-
pent column directly before the silica trap helps to remove any 
residual moisture and maintain the longevity of the silica trap. 
The Ascarite column can also be placed inside the quartz tube 
of the molybdenum column at the outlet end; however, this 
placement results in more connections and/or valves between 
the desiccant and the silica trap, which increased the possibility 
of introduction of moisture to the trap. 
10. When ﬁlling the stainless tube with silica, use a dipstick to 
measure and even the silica height on each side. Tap the tube 
repeatedly to pack the silica. Use small pieces of frit material 
and push down on each side to hold the silica in place. 
11. On the Tracermaker™, the stainless tube is attached to electri-
cal probes to heat the trap with an electrical current in order to 
speed the release of [11 C]CO from the silica. 
12. This method has been reported for the synthesis of [11 C] 
ibrutinib as well using 3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1-(piperidin-3-
yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine
as 
precursor [21]. 
13. We have found that using free base of precursor gives higher 
radiochemical yields and less radioactive by-products than salt 
forms. It is common for amino bases to be commercially sold as 
salts, which will make them difﬁcult to dissolve in aprotic 
solvents such as THF. Addition of 2 equivalents amine base 
(e.g., diisopropylethylamine) is known to aid solubility in those 
cases. 
14. It is also often possible to use a vinyl/aryl bromide or vinyl/ 
aryl triﬂate in place of the vinyl/aryl iodide. 
15. Other Xantphos and diphosphine ligands have been tested with 
some efﬁcacy [18]. 
16. Other Pd(0) or Pd(II) catalysts have also have been used with 
varying success in trapping efﬁciencies and yields [18].

12
Emily Murrell et al.
17. Freshly distilled, or SureSeal™ (with or without butylated 
hydroxytoluene (BHT)) THF is important for the yield of 
the reaction. When using THF with trace water or impurities 
(peroxides), a common by-product is the 11 C-labeled carbox-
ylic acid. Yields were also lower when using alternate dry 
aprotic solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, or DMF 
(which also have higher boiling points making them more 
difﬁcult to remove). 
18. These methods have also been adapted to “in-loop” carbonyl-
ation reactions using an HPLC loop as the reaction vessel 
[22, 23]. 
19. Ensure that when trapping [11 C]CO2 or [11 C]CO in the reac-
tion mixture solution, the dispensing needle is submerged in 
the solvent and conﬁrm that the gas is bubbling into it. 
20. Vinyl iodide in THF solution can be prepared ahead of time. A 
solution of vinyl iodide (10 μL) in 4 mL anhydrous THF is 
prepared as follows: Handle vinyl iodide in a fumehood. Store 
vinyl iodide in the fridge and dispense into THF while the vial 
is still cold. The vinyl iodide/THF mixture has a shelf life of 
1 week in a jar with desiccant (Drierite) at room temperature. 
Sealed vials should be wrapped with paraﬁlm and covered with 
aluminum foil to protect from light. 
21. Palladium source and ligand vial can be prepared ahead of time. 
To make in advance add both compounds to vial with septum. 
Store under inert atmosphere, seal vial with paraﬁlm, and store 
the sealed vial in a jar with desiccant (Drierite) at -5 to 20  °C.

Enantioselective Synthesis of Carbon-11-Labeled Amino 
Acids and Peptides 
Aleksandra Pekosˇak, Albert D. Windhorst, and Alex J. Poot 
Abstract 
Radiolabeled amino acids (AAs), their derivatives, and peptides are essential radiotracers in nuclear imaging. 
Despite its potential, the preparation of enantiopure radiopharmaceuticals poses several challenges, 
demanding a great need for rapid and stereocontrolled reactions. This chapter describes a highly stereo-
selective carbon-11 alkylation of Schiff bases, to obtain radiolabeled AAs and small peptides. The method 
uses chiral quaternary ammonium salt phase-transfer catalyst with two alkylating agents, namely, [11 C] 
methyl iodide and [11 C]benzyl iodide. This methodology allows the radiolabeling of AAs and peptides with 
excellent regioselectivity and enantiomeric or diastereomeric excess. 
Key words Carbon-11, Amino acid, Peptide, Stereoselective synthesis, Radiolabeling, PET imaging

Introduction 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive technique 
that is routinely used for diagnosis in, e.g., oncology and neurol-
ogy. PET relies on the visualization and quantiﬁcation of molecules 
equipped with positron-emitting nuclides, PET radiopharmaceuti-
cals, or tracers [1]. Therefore, the distribution and kinetics as well 
as the biochemical and physiological behavior of the PET tracer can 
be assessed, and as such cellular processes in vivo can be studied [2]. 
Important classes of compounds for PET tracer development 
are amino acids (AAs) and peptides. AAs play a crucial role in 
virtually all biological processes, e.g., protein synthesis, cell signal-
ing, precursors for biomolecular transmission, redox homeostasis, 
and as neurotransmitters [3]. AAs can passively diffuse into cells; 
however, the main transmembrane transport of AAs into cells 
occurs through speciﬁc membrane-associated proteins, so-called 
AA-transporters. Due to the imperative role of generally existing 
or tissue-speciﬁc AA-transport systems and their consumption in 
many cellular processes, radiolabeled AAs have become important

PET tracers to diagnose, stage, and study cancer biology, consider-
ing that malignant tissue often relies on increased AA uptake 
[4]. The value of AA-based PET tracers is best demonstrated by 
[11 C]methionine and O-(2-[18 F]ﬂuoroethyl)-L-tyrosine, which 
are used routinely in clinical settings for tumor diagnosis. Further-
more, multiple AAs and analogs thereof, e.g., [11 C]glutamine or 
derivatives
(2S,4S)-4-(3-[18 F]ﬂuoropropyl)glutamine
and 
3-(1-[18 F]ﬂuoromethyl)-L-alanine, are under (pre)clinical devel-
opment [5–9].

In addition, peptides have gained increasing importance as 
imaging agents and PET tracers. Peptides generally have a high 
afﬁnity and speciﬁcity for receptor targets expressed on the cellular 
membrane, which often occur in nanomolar concentrations in 
diseased tissue. Due to many favorable properties for molecular 
imaging, such as advantageous pharmacokinetics and speciﬁc 
tumor targeting characteristics, combined with the overexpression 
of peptide receptors on the tumor cells, radiolabeled peptides are 
important for the PET imaging of cancer, especially when they are 
used as companion diagnostic with targeted radionuclide therapy 
[10]. Peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals have been successfully 
employed for imaging of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression 
using radiolabeled analogs of somatostatin as natural ligand, bom-
besin analogs for cholecystokinin/gastrin receptor-overexpressing 
tumors, and speciﬁc radiolabeled peptides targeting CXC receptor 
4-expressing cancer cells [11–14]. As PET tracers, both AAs and 
peptides are used for disease diagnosis and treatment strategies and 
to establish new biological targets for therapy. Though their role 
in vivo and in biology and thus their potential and possible applica-
tion as PET tracers are different, structurally AAs as building blocks 
of peptides are chemically related. 
Many methodologies have been developed since the 1980s for 
radiolabeling AAs or peptides using organic approaches employing 
11 C, 18 F, or iodine isotopes, as well as radiometals. Excellent 
reviews have been published that describe these different strategies 
for labeling AAs or peptides [15–17]. Only very few generally 
applicable methodologies are developed that can be used both for 
labeling AAs and peptides that result in high yields and a high 
enantiomeric purity and without adjustments to the chemical struc-
ture of the lead compound (Fig. 1)  [18–20]. Here we describe the 
enantioselective radiolabeling of AAs and peptides with 11 C  b  
employing the chiral alkylation of a Schiff base precursor with a 
11 C-labeled alkyl iodide. By conducting a comprehensive reaction 
condition optimization and a strategic analysis of several phase-
transfer catalysts that facilitate enantioselective alkylation, we 
describe the radiolabeling of L/D-[11 C]alanine, L/D-[11 C]phenyl 
alanine, dipeptides, and tetrapeptides (Fig. 2)  [21–24]. This meth-
odology here described is broadly applicable and can potentially 
also be used for the 11 C-labeling of other AAs and peptides. The

radiosynthesis of L/D-[11 C]alanine has been adopted by other 
research groups, and the PET tracer is used for the imaging of 
tumors and bacterial infections [25].

for Schiff base alkylation. Schematic representation of the enantioselective 11 C-labeling of AAs and di- and 
tetrapeptides using the chiral alkylation of Schiff base precursors 
In the addition to the synthesis of unfunctionalized AAs and 
peptides, we investigated the application of this methodology to 
radiolabel functionalized AAs, such as glutamine or glutamic acid. 
Therefore, a Michael addition reaction of the Schiff base precursor 
was exploited. Though comparable reactions have been described 
in organic chemistry, it is to date not possible to translate this 
methodology to radiochemistry and the enantioselective synthesis 
of [11 C]glutamine and [11 C]glutamic acid [23].

1 month after opening. The container should be sealed with 
paraﬁlm and stored under 4–8 °C. Before the start of the 
synthesis, 
the 
container 
should 
warm 
up 
to 
ambient 
temperature.

Abstract 
Fluorine-18 (18 F) is undoubtedly one of the most frequently applied radionuclides for the development of 
new radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) in the context of clinical cancer, neurological, 
and metabolic imaging. Until recently, the available radiochemical methodologies to introduce 18 F into 
organic molecules ranging from small- to medium- and large-sized compounds were limited to a few 
applicable protocols. With the advent of late-stage ﬂuorination of small aromatic, nonactivated compounds 
and various noncanonical labeling strategies geared toward the labeling of peptides and proteins, the 
molecular toolbox for PET radiotracer development was substantially extended. Especially, the noncanoni-
cal labeling methodologies characterized by the formation of Si–18 F, B–18 F, and Al–18 F bonds give access 
to kit-like 18 F-labeling of complex and side-group unprotected compounds, some of them already in clinical 
use. This chapter will particularly focus on silicon–ﬂuoride acceptor (SiFA) chemistry and cover the history 
of its conceptual design and its translation into the clinical practice.

Introduction 
1.1 
Noncanonical 
Labeling Methods 
As ﬂuorine-18 has been found to be extremely useful in PET 
imaging due to its low mean β+ energy of 250 keV and ideal half-
life of t1/2 = 109.5 min, its incorporation into targeting vectors has 
been the subject of many studies into 
18 F-labeling strategies 
[1]. The method of 18 F incorporation into organic molecules orig-
inally was done through nucleophilic or electrophilic substitutions 
generating a carbon–18 F bond. However, these reactions typically 
are slow and occur under harsh conditions that are not suitable for 
peptide and protein targeting vectors. Additionally, the reactions 
are not very speciﬁc, and the generation of by-products requires 
timely and expensive separation techniques [1]. More recently,

methods have been implemented that take advantage of boronic 
ester and hypervalent iodonium ylide leaving group chemistry 
[2]. These procedures all require metal catalysts and more time-
intensive puriﬁcation techniques such as high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), limiting their efﬁcacy as PET radiotracer 
synthesis methods. Ideally, radiolabeling of compounds with 
ﬂuorine-18 should take place by relatively simple and fast proce-
dures that are reliable and highly standardized and result in a high 
molar activity of the radiotracer, yielding PET images with better 
contrast and speciﬁcity [2]. As well, puriﬁcation should be timely 
and efﬁcient, without the need to use HPLC.

Boron–18 F-labeling approach. (c) Silicon–18 F-labeling approach [3, 4] 
The development of methods to introduce 18 F using silicon–18-
F, boron–18 F, and aluminum–18 F radiochemistry has been a great 
advancement to the ﬁeld of PET imaging (Fig. 1). Perrin et al. 
introduced labeling methods based on boron–18 F bond formation 
that have been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the labeling of pep-
tides for PET imaging [2]. Ametamey et al. established silicon-
based 18 F chemistry concurrently with the Schirrmacher, W€angler, 
and Jurkschat groups’ development of silicon–ﬂuoride acceptor 
(SiFA) chemistry, which will be discussed in more detail below 
[2]. Conversely, Goldenberg et al. instigated a method of 18 F-label-
ing that incorporates chelator chemistry usually implemented in 
radiometal-labeling [5, 6]. In this approach, 18 F interacts with 
Al3+ and is consecutively stabilized via chelator complexation. 
Even though a Si–18 F bond energy is known to be 90 kJ higher 
than a C–F bond, some initial studies exploiting the use of organo-
ﬂuorosilanes were hampered due to the kinetic lability of the Si–F 
bond toward hydrolysis [2]. Rosenthal et al. observed this when 
they labeled chlorotrimethylsilane with 18 F-, resulting in [18 F] 
ﬂuorotrimethylsilane with very low in vivo stability to result in 
silanole formation and 
18 F bone uptake [1, 7]. Due to this

disadvantage, researchers sought to determine the effects of adding 
bulky groups on the silicon core to prevent hydrolysis of the Si–F 
bond. Blower et al. as well as Schirrmacher and Jurkschat were able 
to show that, indeed, the incorporation of sterically hindered 
groups improved the stability of the Si–F bond. The ﬁrst few 
compounds investigated had a combination of aryl and tert-butyl 
substituents on the silicon atom, and their in vivo stability was 
probed. These initial studies found that [18 F]triorganoﬂuorosilane 
(with 2 tert-butyl and one aryl group) had exceptional stability 
in vivo and thus was used as a building block to further develop 
18 F-radiolabeling methods using Si–F chemistry. The Perrin group 
was able to generate radioactive organotetraﬂuorosilicate salts at 
approximately the same time as Schirrmacher and Jurkschat were 
developing methods for isotopic exchange of “cold” ﬂuorine to 
radioactive 18 F [1, 8, 9].

1.2 
The Development 
of 18 F-SiFA Labeling 
Usually, isotopic exchange reactions as a way of radiolabeling are 
considered to be less than ideal as they tend to result in lower molar 
activities of the tracers, meaning the amount of 18 F relative to 
19 F-bearing pharmaceutical is low (measured in units of activity 
per mol) [10]. In the case of C–18 F chemistry, isotopic exchange 
reactions yield molar activities in the low kBq/μmol range [1]. This 
is a signiﬁcant issue as high molar activity is required for successful 
in vivo applications, especially when the target is present in low 
quantities such as enzymes or cell surface receptors. If the molar 
activity is too low, a considerable fraction of target structures is 
saturated by nonradioactive “carrier,” resulting in low target speci-
ﬁcity or even failure to visualize the target. Additionally, the lower 
the molar activity, the more tracer is required to be injected to 
produce adequate PET images, thus leading to potential adverse 
pharmacological effects in patients. Moreover, in receptor target 
systems, only less than 1% of receptors should be occupied by a 
radiotracer to limit any erroneous receptor function [1, 11]. Impor-
tantly, since 18 F and 19 F have the same chemical and physical 
properties, the nonradioactive compound cannot be separated 
from that with the 18 F-label, which could also signiﬁcantly decrease 
the molar activity. However, due to this characteristic, labeled 
agents obtained by isotopic exchange do not require a puriﬁcation 
procedure which could greatly improve the efﬁciency of the prepa-
ration of the radiotracers. Due to this advantage, radiolabeling of 
organosilicon compounds with 18 F using isotopic exchange chem-
istry was investigated to determine if the molar activity and radio-
chemical yield would be sufﬁcient for in vivo applications. The ﬁrst 
experiment was done with Ph3SiF in 2006, which proved that 
isotopic exchange could be a viable option. This was due to the 
easy exchange of 19 F  to  18 F at room temperature in only a few 
minutes in acetonitrile that gave radiochemical yields of over 90% 
[2, 12]. Unfortunately, this compound was found to be unstable at

physiological pH as it underwent hydrolysis. Further results of 
reactions done with the organoﬂuorosilane tBu2PhSiF proved 
that the isotopic exchange method could produce high radiochem-
ical yields and molar activities (~230 GBq/μmol) [1]. Moreover, 
this compound proved to be more stable against hydrolysis as 
animal studies only showed minimal 18 F uptake in the bones over 
a 2 h period. Additionally, the puriﬁcation process was facile and 
time efﬁcient as no side products were formed and only the 
unreacted [18 F]ﬂuoride had to be removed after the labeling reac-
tion. Due to this, the puriﬁcation could occur by ﬂushing them 
through a C18 solid phase cartridge. The radiolabeled compound 
would stay stuck in the cartridge as impurities are ﬂushed out, and 
then using an elution solution the pure radiotracer could be 
obtained. Furthermore, reactions could be done under mild con-
ditions with short reaction times. This substantial contribution to 
the ﬁeld of PET radiotracer synthesis is known as SiFA chemistry. It 
was ﬁrst introduced as a way to label peptides and has since been 
used in a wide variety of compounds as a potential way of introdu-
cing 18 F onto targeting vectors for PET imaging [12].

Synthesis
The synthesis and isolation of SiFA compounds (Fig. 2) have been 
well reported and follow a straightforward procedure. The ﬁrst step 
is a metal–halogen exchange reaction that takes place when the 
silyl-protected 4-bromobenzene is treated with tert-butyllithium. 
Next, the resulting aryllithium derivative undergoes a salt metathe-
sis reaction with di-tert-butyldiﬂuorosilane where the carbanion 
acts as a strong nucleophile, undergoing substitution with one of 
the silicon-bound ﬂuoride atoms and forming the Si–C bond. This 
works to attach the t-Bu2SiF moiety to the functionalized benzene 
ring allowing for its attachment to a targeting vector after a ﬁnal 
deprotection step. 
1.4 
Peptides and 
Limitations of the 
SiFA-Based 18 F-
Labeling Approach 
One of the ﬁrst SiFA-derivatized peptides synthesized was SiFA-
TATE, where the SiFA moiety is attached to the peptide Tyr3-
octreotate. This peptide is important for the diagnosis of neuroen-
docrine tumors (NET), which are characterized by their increase in 
somatostatin receptors (SSTR) [13]. To image these tumors, 
octreotide-derivative peptides have been found to be the most 
useful due to their high afﬁnity toward SSTR2 as well as having 
an ideal biological half-life of ~72–98 min [14]. Signiﬁcantly, the 
radiochemical half-life of 18 F is a great match, allowing enough 
time for the distribution of the 18 F-labeled peptide to its intended 
target receptors without too much loss of radioactivity. Success-
ful radiolabeling of this peptide–SiFA conjugate through isotopic 
exchange was instrumental in demonstrating the ability of SiFA to 
have preference for 18 F/19 F isotopic exchange over any 18 F-/pep-
tidic acidic group interactions [2]. Acidic group interactions are a 
signiﬁcant issue when it comes to isotopic exchange chemistry due

t
to their potential interaction with nucleophilic [18 F]ﬂuoride and 
thus suppression of the labeling reaction. The alternative, using a 
protecting group to decrease the reactivity of the acidic func-
tional groups, is also not optimal as the introduction and removal 
of protecting groups can be difﬁcult and have negative conse-
quences on the peptide, as well as the puriﬁcation process being 
demanding. Therefore, the reaction of SiFA-TATE with 18 F a  
room temperature producing a radiochemical yield of 95% within 
10 min was a massive achievement and improvement in the ﬁeld 
[2]. This result demonstrated the ability of SiFA to label clinically 
signiﬁcant compounds with 18 F in a one-step isotopic exchange 
process under mild conditions, fast time frames and with high 
selectivity. 
SiFA 18F-Radiolabeling
33
Fig. 2 General scheme for SiFA synthesis [1] 
Although SiFA chemistry provides many advantages in the 
world of 18 F-labeling and PET imaging, it does come with some 
limitations. A major drawback is its intrinsic lipophilicity that can 
conversely affect the ability of the radiotracer to have the appropri-
ate biodistribution needed. If the lipophilicity is too high, the 
compound will not have the time to adequately distribute in the 
organism to enable target interaction and thus visualization. 
Instead, the radiotracer will be trapped and metabolized in the 
liver in what is known as the ﬁrst pass effect, removing it out of 
the blood to be excreted. This issue simply means that the com-
pound would never make it to its intended targets and that tumor 
imaging would be impossible. This was seen when bis-tert-butyl 
SiFA was applied to rats and its accumulation was primarily in the 
liver before excretion [1]. Furthermore, SiFA derivatives of small 
molecule brain-imaging agents fallypride and desmethoxyfallypride 
showed no uptake in the brain of healthy rats due to the lipophili-
city concerns [2]. This issue was conﬁrmed when in vivo studies of 
SiFA-TATE showed most of its uptake primarily in the liver. Fur-
ther, this signiﬁes that attachment of lipophilic SiFA to a peptide 
was enough to affect the overall lipophilicity of the compound and 
cause adverse biodistribution [15]. This limitation could possibly 
be overcome through the addition of a charge or hydrophilic 
groups to the SiFA group, or to the peptide itself. It has been 
shown that TATE derivatives with hydrophilic groups attached at 
the N-terminus such as carbohydrates or charged amino acids are

more ﬂexible to SiFA modiﬁcation without losing their ability to 
bind to their target receptor [2]. W€angler et al. used a derivative 
where a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group and glycosylated aspartic 
acid were added in between the SiFA and TATE to produce [18 F] 
SiFA-Asn(AcNH-β-Glc)-PEG-Tyr3-octreotate [16]. Lipophilicity 
and in vivo studies in comparison to SiFA-TATE showed a remark-
able decrease in lipophilicity (2.20 to 0.96) and elevation in tumor 
uptake (0 to -7.7%) [15]. Additional modiﬁcations were tested 
until [18 F]SiTATE (previously known as [18 F]SiFAlin-TATE) 
(Fig. 3) was developed, which consists of a permanently positively 
charged SiFA, two aspartic acids, and an Asn(AcNH-β-Glc)-PEG1 
spacer [17].

Fig. 3 Schematic drawing of [18 F]-SiTATE 
[18 F]SiTATE was able to yield extremely high tumor uptake, 
similar to that of the gold standard [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE when 
applied to NET-bearing mice (Fig. 4) [18, 19]. Signiﬁcantly, 18 F 
also offers further advantages over using a 68 Ga radiotracer, such as 
its widespread availability, its ideal positron energy (offering higher 
spatial resolution images), longer half-life, and less expensive 
production [20]. 
The ﬁrst human clinical studies reported by Ilhan et al. in 2019 
evaluated [18 F]-SiTATE in 13 patients diagnosed with NET and 
compared the scans to [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC [20]. Results 
showed that [18 F]-SiTATE had higher tumor-to-normal tissue 
uptake, also seen in the preclinical studies, as well as comparable 
image quality and biodistribution (Fig. 5), thus making [18 F]-
SiTATE an excellent candidate as a PET imaging radiotracer. 
More recently, Unterrainer et al. compared an [18 F]-SiTATE 
PET/CT to [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT in a patient with falx 
meningioma and transosseous extension, which are known to have 
high SSTR expression on cell surfaces [21]. They found that the 
tumor uptake was extremely similar, and since the use of 18 F 
resolves some limitations inherent with 68 Ga use, it may become 
the future gold standard in NET and meningioma PET imaging

(Fig. 6). Further clinical studies done by Beyer et al. in 2021 looked 
into tracer kinetics by evaluating PET images over several time 
points 
in 
eight 
patients 
with 
different 
NET 
tumor 
types 
[22]. They found that lower administered radiotracer activities 
(~100–120 MBq) are adequate in producing a sufﬁcient image 
quality as well as an increasing tumor-to-background ratio over 
time. Based on their results, and with patient logistics taken into 
consideration, it was determined that the ideal imaging strategy 
would be to start the image acquisition 90 min after injection 
[22]. Additionally, efforts have recently been made by Linder 
et al. to fully automate the production of [18 F]-SiTATE so that it 
will be widely accessible by diagnostic centers and medical clinics 
[23]. The process uses a cassette-method Scintomics GRP™ plat-
form where all steps take place in a timed sequence on two mani-
folds with ten valves [23]. Clinical studies using this automated 
system resulted in no reported acute side effects of the tracer and 
typical tumor uptake and biodistribution. This further exempliﬁes 
the accessibility and potential ease of incorporation of [18 F]-
SiTATE into full clinical application.

1.5 
Proteins
In contrast to peptide labeling, protein labeling requires a small 
molecule prosthetic group to be radiolabeled before being attached 
to the protein of interest. This is essential as proteins have a great

quantity of side chains and functionalities that would potentially
interact with the 18F. Therefore, the prosthetic groups require a
functional moiety that would allow it to be easy coupled to the
protein such as an active ester or click chemistry amenable group
[ ]. A speciﬁc way of protein labeling with a prosthetic SiFA group
was explored by attaching an isothiocyanate group to the SiFA
building block. That way the protein in question does not need
any modiﬁcation prior to the SiFA attachment, since isothiocya-
nates are reactive with the amine groups on preexisting lysine side
chains. Flourine-18 labeling of SiFA isothiocyanate compounds
resulted in high radiochemical yields (~95%), and further incor-
poration into three varying proteins gave radiochemical yields of
~30–80% [ ,
]. Conversely, when labeling SiFA building blocks
comprising active ester moieties, a challenge arose. It was found
that the basic labeling conditions resulted in degradation of the

compounds due to active ester hydrolysis. Thus, the acidity of the 
labeling mixture was altered by addition of oxalic acid [1]. In 
addition, the active ester moiety being situated at the meta position 
as opposed to the para position greatly increased the stability of the 
compound. Moreover, Glaser et al. have been able to show the 
applicability of SiFA labeling toward afﬁbodies. They demonstrated 
the ability to 18 F-label those large biomolecules with high selectiv-
ity and efﬁciency [25].

1.6 
Small Molecules
Due to the increased similarity in size between small molecules and 
the SiFA moiety, the lipophilicity issue is greatly enhanced. Yet, 
recent studies into negating this unfortunate consequence have 
shown that increasing the number of ligands relative to the number 
of SiFA groups in a multivalent ligand strategy may be successful. 
Hazari et al. used a SiFA-derivatized bivalent 5-hydroxytryptamine 
1A (5-HT1A)-selective compound with an afﬁnity for serotonin 
receptors and found high uptake in areas with upregulated recep-
tors [15, 26]. Previous studies done on silicon–18 F analogs of 
FMISO used for hypoxia imaging, which seemed promising, 
showed low stability and low target uptake [27, 28]. Further, 
nucleosides and nucleotides were derivatized with SiFA for their 
labeling via isotopic exchange. The radiolabeling experiments 
resulted in average radiochemical yields ~40%, yet elevated tem-
peratures were required [26].

Other 
Applications 
The ease and efﬁciency that SiFA chemistry offers for 18 F-labeling 
makes it a good candidate for areas outside of radiotracer develop-
ment as well. For instance, Schirrmacher et al. used the SiFA 
methodology to label maleimide-terminated PEGylated gold nano-
particles (AuNP) (Fig. 7) [29]. High radiochemical yields were 
obtained (60–80%), and in vivo studies using healthy rats showed 
substantial brain uptake. This technique with SiFA-tetrazine (SiFA-
O-Tz) has been used as a sensor to demonstrate the ability to 
modify sp2-hybridized graphite surfaces through an inverse elec-
tron Diels–Alder reaction. 
More recently, SiFA has been introduced into a prostate-
speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) radiohybrid ligand by Wester 
et al. in 2020 [30]. Essentially, these radiohybrid PSMA inhibitors 
(rhPSMAs) contain a SiFA moiety as well as a chelator. Initially, the 
chelator was introduced as a way to increase hydrophilicity; how-
ever, it became apparent there was a greater advantage to having a 
molecule with both isotopic exchange and chelation-labeling stra-
tegies available. Either the SiFA moiety could be labeled with 18 F 
and a nonradioactive metal for PET imaging or the chelator could 
be labeled with other radioisotopes available for imaging (e.g., 68 Ga 
or 111 In) or therapy (e.g., 177 Lu) [30]. This is also useful as medical 
centers with no access to a cyclotron could still use 68 Ga to generate 
a nearly identical PET image [31]. Moreover, the use of 18 F-nat Lu-
rhPSMA and 19 F-177 Lu-rhPSMA as molecules with the same chem-
ical properties can generate, for the ﬁrst time, an 18 F-177 Lu “ther-
anostic” pair, effectively combining the ability of PET diagnostics 
and radiotherapy into one radiopharmaceutical. This also allows for 
more personalized treatment plans as the radiotracer used for

imaging could be exploited as a tool for pretherapeutic dosimetry 
and patient stratiﬁcation [30]. Interestingly, in vitro experiments 
with the synthesized rhPSMAs showed that they had lower lipo-
philicity (log P of -2.0 to -3.5) than any other SiFA compound 
currently reported in literature [30]. Additionally, when compared 
to established 
18 F-PSMA reference compounds DCFPyL and 
PSMA-1007, they showed comparable uptake in most nonspeciﬁc 
tissues yet lower uptake in the liver in addition to higher blood 
levels. These results suggest that rhPSMA inhibitors have the 
potential to greatly enhance diagnosis and treatment options for 
patients suffering from prostate cancer. Further clinical studies with 
18 F-nat Ga-rhPSMA-7 (Fig. 8) showed remarkable results in imag-
ing high-risk primary prostate cancer, even when patients had low 
antigen levels [31]. One of the rhPSMA isomers ([18 F]Ga-
rhPSMA-7.3) was identiﬁed as the best candidate for theranostic 
applications and is presently in phase III clinical trials. Due to its 
success, an automated synthesis was developed using the Munich 
method where the azeotropic drying step is eliminated and the 
entirety of the labeling process is done at room temperature 
[31]. Instead of azeotropic drying, they were able to use an 
on-cartridge drying procedure where 
18 F was subjected to a 
QMA cartridge and allowed to dry rapidly on the column through 
purging with air and elution of anhydrous acetonitrile [31]. Further 
elution of the 18 F with K222 in acetonitrile resulted in almost no loss 
of activity (96% retained). The whole automation process uses a 
double-cassette setup and a nine-step procedure and has superb 
reliability (98.8%) and radiochemical yields (~50%) [31]. The 
development 
of 
an 
adequate 
automated 
process 
effectively 
enhances the ability to introduce SiFA-derivatized compounds 
into the clinic.

Overall, the SiFA methodology has come a long way since its 
ﬁrst arrival in literature in 2006. As discussed, it presents a great 
improvement in the PET imaging ﬁeld. The labeling procedure can 
be carried out under mild conditions, with fast reaction times and 
high selectivity. The whole synthesis and procedure is able to be 
highly automated as seen with [18 F]-SiTATE and [18 F]Ga-
rhPSMA-7.3. The reliable and easy automation process along 
with the present clinical study results highlights its exceptional 
ability to be translated into future clinical applications.

through a C18 cartridge. 
2. Add the [18 F]ﬂuoride solution to the SiFA precursor com-
pound (100 μL, ~20–100 nmol) and allow the labeling reac-
tion to sit at room temperature for 5 min. 
3. Draw reaction solution up into a syringe that contains 9 mL 
0.1 M phosphate buffer. 
4. Pass the resulting solution through the C18 cartridge. 
5. Pass 5 mL of distilled H2O through the cartridge to wash and 
then 300 μL of ethanol to elute the [18 F]SiFA compound. 
6. Dilute with 3 mL phosphate buffer for HPLC injection onto a 
C18 column to assess the radiochemical purity (RCP). 
7. Monitor reaction by radioTLC to determine radiochemical 
yields (RCY).

Notes 
All necessary precautions should be taken when working with 
radioactive isotopes including using lead shielding, wearing a 
dosimeter, checking for contamination with Geiger counters, and 
wearing appropriate PPE. Only the ﬁrst four drops of the eluted 
[18 F]ﬂuoride need to be taken as most of the radioactivity is 
eluted in those initial drops. This is important to minimize any 
base-related degradation to the SiFA moiety as it limits the amount 
of base in the reaction solution [32].

Abstract 
Direct C–H functionalization of (hetero)aromatic C–H bonds with iridium-catalyzed borylation followed 
by copper-mediated radioﬂuorination of the in situ generated organoboronates affords ﬂuorine-18 labeled 
aromatics in high radiochemical conversions and meta-selectivities. This protocol describes the benchtop 
reaction assembly of the C–H borylation and radioﬂuorination steps, which can be utilized for the ﬂuorine-
18 labeling of densely functionalized bioactive scaffolds.

Introduction 
Transition-metal-catalyzed radioﬂuorination has emerged as a pow-
erful method for the formation of aromatic C–18 F bonds, enabling 
complementary electronic selectivity to traditional methods such as 
SNAr radioﬂuorination [1, 2]. In particular, copper-mediated 
radioﬂuorination (CMRF) has become an attractive approach for 
the practical synthesis of 18 F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals due to 
its advantageous operational simplicity (i.e., labeling can be con-
ducted without rigorous exclusion of air and/or moisture) and the 
low-cost and toxicity of copper [3–7]. CMRF of aromatic precur-
sors such as boronic acids and esters [8–10], organostannanes [11], 
iodonium salts [12], and aryl halides [13] have been studied for the 
late-stage radioﬂuorination of (hetero)aromatic substrates. Nota-
bly, organoboron precursors are most commonly used in CMRF 
reactions owing to a high functional group compatibility with 
radioﬂuorination conditions and the good availability of borylation 
methodologies [14, 15].

Fig. 1 Ir/Cu-mediated C–H radioﬂuorination of electronically diverse (hetero)aromatics 
The radioﬂuorination of organoborons has been used to radio-
label many different molecules for preclinical and clinical PET 
imaging [3], and detailed protocols have been reported for execut-
ing the technique [16, 17]. However, challenges can arise when 
preparing, handling, and storing these precursors long term, or 
when dealing with unstable organoborons, which can hamper 
translation to clinical applications. A convenient alternative to 
address these drawbacks is the nucleophilic radioﬂuorination of C 
(sp2 )–H bonds, as such precursors are more readily available and 
stable. However, few reports have studied the CMRF of (hetero)-
aromatic C–H bonds and high selectivity is difﬁcult in the presence 
of multiple C–H bonds [18, 19]. Herein, we present an operation-
ally simple, benchtop setup for a cascade Ir/Cu-mediated C–H 
radioﬂuorination 
of 
electronically 
diverse 
(hetero)aromatics 
(Fig. 1) [20]. This protocol describes a meta-selective Ir-catalyzed 
C(sp2 )–H borylation that is compatible with Cu-mediated radio-
ﬂuorination to achieve the synthesis of 
18 F-labeled substrates. 
Overall, this one-pot transformation circumvents the isolation, 
handling, and storage of unstable organoboron precursors, exhibits 
complimentary and high selectivity for a wide substrate scope com-
pared to other methods, and does not require stringent exclusion of 
air and/or moisture, demonstrating enhanced clinical applicability.

Methods 
3.1 
C–H Borylation 
(see Note 1) 
1. Add 3.2 mg [Ir(cod)OMe]2 (4.8μmol) (see Note 2), 2.3 mg 
3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (tmphen, 4.8μmol), 
and 25 mg 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (0.15 mmol, NMR stan-
dard) to a 4 mL vial equipped with a stir bar. Cap the vial using 
a PTFE-lined screw cap. 
2. For
liquid
arene
substrates:
Add
1.1
mL 
2-methyltetrahydrofuran (see Note 3) to the vial and sparge 
with argon for ca. 2 min (see Note 4). The arene is added in 
Step 4. 
3. For
solid
arene
substrates:
Add
0.55
mL 
2-methyltetrahydrofuran (see Note 3) to the vial and sparge 
with argon for ca. 2 min (see Note 4). To a second 4 mL vial, 
add arene (0.54 mmol) and 0.55 mL 2-methyltetrahydrofuran 
and sparge with argon for ca. 2 min. 
4. After sparging (see Note 5), add 70μL pinacolborane (see Note 
6) (0.48 mmol) to the vial (see Note 7). For heteroaryl sub-
strates or aryl iodide substrates, after the addition of pinacol-
borane, heat the vial at 60 °C, stir for 2 min, and remove from 
the heat source before proceeding to Step 4. 
5. For liquid arene substrates, add arene substrate (0.54 mmol) to 
the reaction vial prepared in Step 3. For solid arene substrates, 
transfer the solution of arene in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran to 
the vial prepared in Step 3 (see Note 8). 
6. Heat the reaction vial to 80 °C (electron-rich or -neutral are-
nes) or keep at room temperature (electron-poor arenes) and 
stir overnight. 
7. Allow the reaction to cool to room temperature. Analyze crude 
aromatic organoboronates with NMR and use in radiolabeling 
(Subheading 3.4) within 12 h of preparation. For NMR analy-
sis, take a ~50μL aliquot of the reaction mixture, remove the 
solvent, and perform 1 H and 13 C NMR analysis using CDCl3. 
3.2 
Synthesis 
Module Setup 
1. Condition a Sep-Pak Accell Plus QMA Plus Light cartridge by 
sequentially rinsing with >6 mL ethanol, >6 mL deionized 
water, 10 mL 0.5 M KOTf aqueous solution, and ﬁnally 10 mL 
deionized water. 
2. Prepare the [18 F]ﬂuoride eluent solution by dissolving 2 mg 
tetraethylammonium bicarbonate and 15 mg of tetrabutylam-
monium triﬂate in 200μL of EtOH then dilute with 400μL of  
deionized water. This solution should be prepared fresh prior 
to use and, if using a TRACERLab FXFN automated ﬂuorine-
18 synthesis module, added to Vial 1. 
3. Add acetonitrile (1 mL) to Vial 2.

Copper-Mediated Radioﬂuorination of Aromatic C–H Bonds
49
4. Add DMA (3 mL) to Vial 3. 
5. Seal the hot-cell door and proceed to production of [18 F] 
ﬂuoride (Subheading 3.3). 
3.3 
Production of 
[18 F]Fluoride 
1. Produce nucleophilic [18 F]ﬂuoride via the 18 O(p,n)18 F nuclear 
reaction in a cyclotron. 
2. Load 18 O-water (approx. 2 mL) into the cyclotron target and 
irradiate for 1–2 min proton beam at 55μA. 
3. After completion of irradiation, transfer the solution of [18 F] 
ﬂuoride to a General Electric TRACERLab FXFN automated 
ﬂuorine-18 synthesis module (or equivalent) and proceed to 
radioﬂuorination (Subheading 3.4). 
3.4 
Small-Scale 
Radioﬂuorination (see 
Notes 9 and 10) 
1. Using a radiosynthesis module (e.g., GE TRACERlab FXFN), 
transfer the aqueous [18 F]ﬂuoride solution from the cyclotron 
onto the QMA cartridge and use the module’s software to elute 
into the reactor with the [18 F]ﬂuoride eluent solution. 
2. Add 1 mL of acetonitrile from Vial 2 and evaporate the mixture 
by heating to 100 °C and drawing vacuum for 5 min and then 
further drying under a stream of argon while maintaining the 
vacuum pull for an additional 8 min (see Note 11). 
3. Dissolve the [18 F]TBAF residue in 3 mL DMA from Vial 3, and 
transfer to an external vial for use outside the hot cell. Typically, 
1.5 to 3.5 GBq is sufﬁcient activity to run ca. 30 small-scale 
experiments utilizing 100μL of this solution (see Notes 12 and 
13). 
4. Under ambient air, dispense 50μL nBuOH into a 4 mL vial 
equipped with a stir bar and containing 20μmol [Cu 
(OTf)2(py)4] dissolved in 300μL DMA (see Note 14). Add 
50μL of crude borylation mixture in 2-MeTHF (see Subhead-
ing 3.1) and ﬁnally 100μL of [18 F]TBAF solution in DMA. 
Cap the vial using a PTFE-lined screw cap (see Note 15). 
5. Heat the reaction vial to 120 °C for 20 min with stirring. The 
reactions should be heated directly after combining the reac-
tants. Allowing the reactants to remain in solution for pro-
longed periods of time in the presence of [Cu(OTf)2(py)4] 
before heating can lead to diminished yields (see Note 16). 
The rate of this degradation is highly substrate dependent. 
Allow the sample to return to room temperature and quench 
with 150μL deionized water. 
6. Analyze the reaction mixture by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC. 
Note that due to radioactive decay, the samples should be of an 
appropriate radioactive concentration and examined in a timely 
manner to obtain satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios. Typically, a 
10μL injection of a sample with a radioactivity concentration of

50
Maria Morales et al.
40–100 MBq/mL is adequate for radio-HPLC analysis and an 
aliquot 
from 
a 
sample 
at 
an 
activity 
concentration 
of 
4–100 MBq/mL is sufﬁcient for radio-TLC analysis. This can 
vary depending on the sensitivity and setup of the radioactivity 
detectors. 
7. Work areas should be cleaned, and radioactive samples stored 
and allowed to decay in accordance with local regulations. 
4 
Notes 
1. Protocol for benchtop borylation is given here. The process can 
alternatively be performed in an inert atmosphere drybox. 
2. For long-term storage, keep solid hygroscopic reagents like [Ir 
(cod)OMe]2 in a vacuum desiccator over drierite at room 
temperature. 
3. Store 2-methyltetrahydrofuran over activated molecular sieves. 
For long-term storage (>1 month), keep reaction solvents in 
an mBraun N2 drybox (or equivalent). 
4. Use narrow gauge sparging and exit needles to avoid 
compromising the integrity of the cap. For example, Air-Tite 
22-gauge x 4″ as sparging needle and BD 22-gauge x 1.5″ as 
exit needle. Sparging can be conducted with an argon-ﬁlled 
balloon or directly from a compressed gas cylinder. Adjust gas 
pressure to give a steady stream of bubbles but avoid high ﬂow 
rates to prevent drastic reduction of solvent volume. 
5. Remove the exit needle prior to adding pinacolborane and 
arene substrate. Raise the sparging needle out of the solvent 
but keep it in the vial during reagent addition. 
6. For long-term storage of pinacolborane, blow a gentle stream 
of argon or nitrogen into the container for a few seconds and 
store at 4 °C. 
7. The color of the solution should change from pale orange to 
dark brown upon addition of pinacolborane. 
8. Perform all reagent additions and transfers using a syringe 
equipped with a narrow-gauge needle to avoid compromising 
the septum. Prior to reagent additions and transfers, ﬁrst purge 
out the needle by drawing in and expelling argon to avoid 
transferring air into the reaction vial. 
9. Protocol for small-scale radiolabeling using aliquots of a [18 F] 
TBAF stock solution prepared on a GE TRACERlab FXFN 
synthesis module is given here. Equivalent synthesis modules 
can alternatively be used.

10. Procedures should only be carried out in areas designated for 
the use of radioactivity and in accordance with local rules 
regarding the safe handling and use of radioactivity. 
11. Prior to the preparation of the [18 F]TBAF stock solution, the 
GE TRACERlab FXFN synthesis module should be adequately 
cleaned in accordance with standard operating procedures and 
the vacuum pump and push gases should be operating at levels 
acceptable for routine production. Argon can be substituted 
with an alternative inert push gas such as nitrogen or helium. 
Dry, high purity gases are recommended. 
12. The total amount of activity used for the preparation of this 
solution should be in agreement with local rules and activity 
limits, while also taking into account the appropriate amount 
of activity required for proper analysis. Typically, a concentra-
tion of 40–100 MBq/mL will be adequate for radio-HPLC 
analysis and 4–10 MBq/mL will be sufﬁcient for radio-TLC 
analysis. 
13. The volume of the stock solution can be adjusted for the 
required number of reactions. For single experiments requiring 
the entire batch of [18 F]TBAF, it may be beneﬁcial to dissolve 
the [18 F]TBAF residue in the reactant solutions to keep the 
concentration of reactants at levels consistent to those 
described in Step 6. The higher concentration of tetraethylam-
monium bicarbonate may also yield lower results. Substituting 
the 2 mg tetraethylammonium bicarbonate in the preparation 
of the [18 F]ﬂuoride eluent solution described in Step 2 with 
50μL of a 0.075 M aqueous tetrabutylammonium bicarbonate 
solution (ABX Prod. No. 808.0000.6) can improve results but 
is much less cost-effective. In cases where the full batch of [18 F] 
TBAF is used for a single reaction, an additional dissolution/ 
evaporation cycle, described in Step 4, can lead to a more 
anhydrous [18 F]TBAF residue. 
14. Electron-deﬁcient substrates afford better yields using Cu 
(impy)4(OTf)2 (impy = imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine) in place of 
Cu(py)4(OTf)2. Prepare Cu(impy)4OTf2 from Cu(OTf)2 and 
imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine as previously described [22]. 
15. Multiple reaction variables such as the type of Cu complex, 
solvent, concentrations, and molar equivalents can be varied 
during this step. 
16. Multiple reactions can be set up and run simultaneously.

Abstract 
Recent developments in 68 Ga-radiopharmaceuticals, including a number of regulatory approvals for clinical 
use, has created a hitherto unprecedented demand for 68 Ga. Reliable access to enough 68 Ga to meet 
growing clinical demand using only 68 Ge/68 Ga generators has been problematic in recent years. To address 
this challenge, we have optimized the direct production of 68 Ga on a cyclotron via the 68 Zn(p,n)68 Ga 
reaction using a liquid target. This protocol describes the cyclotron-based production of [68 Ga]GaCl3 
implemented at the University of Michigan using a liquid target on GE PETtrace instrumentation. The 
protocol provides 56 ± 4 mCi (n = 3) of [68 Ga]GaCl3 that meets the necessary quality control criteria to 
use for the preparation of 68 Ga-radiopharmaceuticals for human use.

Introduction 
Nuclear medicine is entering into a new age of radiotheranostics in 
which precision diagnostic imaging with positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET) is combined with targeted radiotherapeutics to enable 
precision therapy in diseases such as cancer [1]. Given the relatively 
straightforward chemistry development offered with radioactive 
metal ions (radiometals), there has been signiﬁcant focus on the 
development of theranostics consisting of a targeting ligand deco-
rated with a chelating group that complexes radioactive metal ions 
selected for diagnostic (e.g., 64 Cu, 68 Ga) or therapeutic (e.g., 
225 Ac, 213 Bi (alpha), 177 Lu, 90 Y (beta)) applications [2]. Initial 
efforts concentrated on the development of radiometal theranostic 
pairs targeting somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) for PET imaging 
and radiotherapeutic management of neuroendocrine tumors 
(NETs) [3]. In the past 5 years in the United States, [68 Ga]Ga-

[7] were approved by the US FDA, while the European Union 
approved [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC (SomaKIT TOC) and Lutathera 
(Fig. 1). Subsequently, [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 has also been approved 
by the FDA for imaging of prostate cancer [8], along with [177 Lu] 
Lu-PSMA-617 for treatment. [225 Ac]Ac-PSMA-617 is in advanced 
clinical trials for alpha therapy of prostate cancer [9]. Translation of 
numerous other radiotheranostics is also underway, with theranos-
tic agents targeting C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) 
ligands [10] and, most recently, ﬁbroblast activation protein inhi-
bitors (FAPI) [11] also entering clinical trials (Fig. 1).

To date, diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals based on PET radio-
metals have typically been radiolabeled with 68 Ga (89% β+, t1/ 
2 = 68 min) (Fig. 1) and, reﬂecting this, there has been a surge in 
demand for access to the radionuclide in recent years. Historically, 
for agents targeting SSTRs, 68 Ga has usually been eluted from a 
68 Ge/68 Ga generator, a process that can easily be implemented in 
PET facilities that do not own a cyclotron [12]. However, the 
unprecedented demand for [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 expected after 
approval of a prostate cancer radiotherapeutic, as well as the 
newer agents in clinical trials, is further driving demand for 68 Ga 
and highlights the need for access to a reliable (and economical) 
supply of the radionuclide. While generators offer operational sim-
plicity for 68 Ga-tracer production, there are certain limitations:
•
Current generators cost ~ $100,000.00 USD and typically have 
a maximum activity (1.85 GBq, 50 mCi) that restricts elution to 
4 h increments (i.e., 2 production runs per day with 2–4 doses 
per day).
•
Commercial supply has not kept pace with the clinical demand 
and lead times for generator delivery can be signiﬁcant (up to 
18 months [13]). 
Meeting the growing demand for 68 Ga is challenging using 
generators alone. Thus, additional sources of 68 Ga are required to 
meet the current and future patient demand [13]. To this end, we 
have investigated the direct production of 68 Ga on a cyclotron via 
the 68 Zn(p,n)68 Ga reaction [14]. This approach is being increas-
ingly used around the world, evidenced by recent research publica-
tions [15–25] and publication of a European Pharmacopeia 
monograph for the direct accelerator-based production of [68 Ga] 
GaCl3 [26]. Moreover, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) has published a technical document in support of direct 
production of 68 Ga via liquid (hundreds of millicuries) and solid 
targets (multiple Curies) [27], and also begun a coordinated 
research project on cyclotron production of 68 Ga [28]. Notably, 
two of the FDA-approved 68 Ga radiotracers ([68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-
TOC and [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11) have explicit approval for produc-
tion using cyclotron-based 68 Ga.

This protocol describes the cyclotron production of 68 Ga from 
a liquid target. The workﬂow is analogous to production of [18 F] 
ﬂuoride and is compatible with laboratory setups in existing PET 
radiopharmaceutical production centers. The protocol provides 
56 ± 4 mCi (n = 3) of [68 Ga]GaCl3 at end-of-synthesis that 
meets the necessary quality control criteria (Table 1) to use for 
the preparation of 68 Ga-radiopharmaceuticals for human use.

Methods 
All hazardous laboratory chemicals should be used by trained per-
sonnel under the supervision of an environmental health and safety 
ofﬁcer. Radioactivity can only be used with institutional, state, 
and/or federal authorization and according to ALARA principles. 
Users should be properly shielded against radiation. All reactions 
involving radioactivity should be performed in a lead-shielded fume 
hood or hot cell, according to appropriate institutional, state, 
and/or federal radiation safety guidelines. Workers handling radio-
active material must ensure that all appropriate personal protective 
equipment is worn and that shielding, dosimeters, and survey 
meters are always used. Ensure local procedures are observed 
when disposing of radioactive and chemical waste. 
3.1 
Prepare Liquid 
Target Solution 
1. Add isotopically enriched [68 Zn]ZnO (2 g, elemental weight) 
to ultrapure water (~10 mL) in a falcon tube and vortex to form 
a slurry. 
2. Slowly add 70% nitric acid (1 mL) and vortex for 20 s. Repeat 
with additional nitric acid (3 × 1 mL and 1 × 0.3 mL aliquots 
for 
the 
total 
cumulative 
volume 
of 
70% 
nitric 
acid 
added = 4.3 mL). 
3. Add ultrapure water so the ﬁnal solution volume is 30 mL to 
yield a 1.0 M solution of [68 Zn]Zn(NO3)2 in 0.3 M HNO3. 
4. Vortex the ﬁnal solution for 4 min, let the solution stand for at 
least 4 h and then ﬁlter through a 0.22 μm Millex-GS (or equi-
valent) ﬁlter prior to irradiation. Store for up to 6 months at 
room temperature in the dark. 
3.2 
Produce and 
Purify 68 Ga 
1. Produce gallium-68 in the cyclotron via the 68 Zn(p,n)68 Ga 
nuclear reaction. Load ~2.2 mL of 1.0 M solution of [68 Zn] 
Zn(NO3)2 in 0.3 M HNO3 solution prepared in Subheading 
3.1 into the 68 Ga target and irradiate (30–40 μA for ~60 min) 
(see Note 1). Upon completion of irradiation, transfer the

Commons License) 
solution of 68 Ga/Zn in HNO3 to the FASTlab synthesis mod-
ule, or equivalent, with suitable automated synthesis sequence 
(see Note 2). 
2. Dilute the 68 Ga target solution with water from the synthesis 
unit (5.5 mL) to achieve a nitric acid concentration of <0.1 M, 
which is necessary for subsequent processing. 
3. Pass the solution of 68 Ga through 2 mL [~ 700 mg] of theZR 
hydroxamate-based resin (Triskem) to trap 68 Ga (Fig. 2). 
4. Rinse the ZR resin with 0.1 M HNO3 (15 mL) to remove 
residual 68 Zn (Fig. 2). 
5. Elute 68 Ga off the ZR resin with 1.75 M HCl (5–6 mL) 
(Fig. 2), prepared from hydrochloric acid 4 M (From Trace 
Metals HCl) solution (Aqua Solutions, cat. no. AM426). 
6. Transfer the eluent through 2 mL [~ 700 mg] of the TK200 
resin (Triskem) to trap 68 Ga onto the TK200 (Fig. 2).

7. Optional step: Rinse TK200 resin with 3.5 mL 2 M NaCl in 
0.13 M HCl to decrease residual acid (Fig. 2). 
8. Elute [68 Ga]GaCl3 from the TK200 resin with water (3 mL) 
(Fig. 2) (see Note 3). 
9. Transfer [68 Ga]GaCl3 through a Cathivex 0.22 μm sterile ﬁlter 
(or equivalent) into a sterile dose vial (or other reaction vessel 
for downstream chemistry).

2 mL sterile QC vial for QC testing. 
11. Complete quality control testing according to local regulatory 
requirements and using published procedures (see Table 1 for 
results of QC testing) (see Note 4). 
12. Use [68 Ga]GaCl3 to prepare desired 68 Ga-radiopharmaceuti-
cals (see Notes 5–8). 
3.3 
Quality Control 
Testing of 68 Ga 
1. Establish radiochemical yield by measuring the dose activity 
using a dose calibrator. 
2. Determine radiochemical purity using radio-TLC. 
3. Complete a visual inspection to determine dose is clear, color-
less, and free of particulates. 
4. Determine the pH of the solution by applying a sample to pH 
paper and comparing to the provided scale. 
5. Conﬁrm radionuclidic identity by measuring the activity in a 
sample over a deﬁned time period using a dose calibrator, and 
verifying that the half-life of the solution matches that of 68 Ga 
(68 min). 
6. Verify the solution is free of bacterial endotoxins via the limulus 
amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test using a Charles River Endosafe 
(or equivalent) system. 
7. Determine radionuclidic purity using a multichannel analyzer 
(MCA) or equivalent test. 
8. Determine residual metal content in the solution using dedi-
cated test strips or ICP-MS. 
3.4 
Site Cleaning
1. Work areas and synthesis module should be cleaned, and radio-
active samples stored and allowed to decay in accordance with 
local regulations. 
2. For optimal liquid target performance, a conditioning run 
should be completed daily. Load ~2.2 mL 0.6 M HNO3 into 
the gallium-68 target and irradiate with a 30–40 μA proton 
beam for >15 min. Upon completion of irradiation, transfer 
the solution to waste and allow to decay in place (see Note 2).

Notes 
1. Enriched 68 Zn is utilized to produce 68 Ga in a cyclotron 
(GE PETtrace or equivalent) via the 68 Zn(p,n)68 Ga reaction 
with energy degraded or selected to reduce the 
68 Zn 
(p,2n)67 Ga competing reaction (e.g., ~13–14 MeV). The pro-
tocol for 1 h irradiation of a single liquid target is given here. 
Irradiation time can be reduced if less activity is needed, or 
additional targets can be irradiated simultaneously if more 
activity is needed. 
2. Signiﬁcant 13 N is generated during the production of 68 Ga and 
target conditioning via the 16 O(p,α)13 N reaction. Proper infra-
structure conﬁguration and containment must be considered. 
3. Volume of water can be varied to yield [68 Ga]GaCl3 in the 
desired formulation (e.g., 5 mL of 0.1 M HCl). 
4. Complete QC testing using methods outlined in Subheading 
3.3 as well as previously published procedures [14]. 
5. For example, [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE and [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-
11 can be prepared as previously described [14, 27]. 
6. Radiopharmaceuticals can be prepared by transferring [68 Ga] 
GaCl3 to a synthesis module or a kit. Alternatively, depending 
on the synthesis module and process, it may be possible to 
execute both the [68 Ga]GaCl3 puriﬁcation and subsequent 
labeling in a single module/process [14]. 
7. Procedures should only be carried out in areas designated for 
the use of radioactivity and in accordance with local rules 
regarding the safe handling and use of radioactivity. 
8. Radiolabeling with radiometals and chelators is a process which 
is generally sensitive to trace metal impurities. Suitable quality 
reagents 
and 
consumables 
(e.g., 
needles) 
and 
material 
handling/processing should be considered to minimize intro-
duction of such impurities throughout 68 Ga production and 
radiolabeling. 
9. Local quality assurance and quality control requirements 
should be met when preparing radioactive materials for 
human use.

Transition and Post-Transition Radiometals for PET Imaging 
and Radiotherapy 
Caterina Ramogida and Eric Price 
Abstract 
Radiometals are an exciting class of radionuclides because of the large number of metallic elements available 
that have medically useful isotopes. To properly harness radiometals, they must be securely bound by 
chelators, which must be carefully matched to the radiometal ion to maximize radiolabeling performance 
and the stability of the resulting complex. This chapter focuses on practical aspects of radiometallation 
chemistry including chelator selection, radiolabeling procedures and conditions, radiolysis prevention, 
puriﬁcation, quality control, requisite equipment and reagents, and useful tips. 
Key words Radiometals, Bifunctional chelators, PET, TRT, Radiolabeling

Introduction 
There are a large number of metal and metalloid elements with 
useful radioactive isotopes (radionuclides) for potential use in PET 
imaging via positron emission, and targeted radiotherapy via emis-
sion of alpha particles, beta particles, or Auger electrons. In order to 
utilize radiometals for radiopharmaceutical purposes, they must be 
incorporated into a drug delivery compound that has afﬁnity for a 
speciﬁc tissue or disease type. The term “radiolabeling” refers to a 
radiometal being incorporated into such drug compounds. The 
most common way to incorporate an inorganic nuclide into a 
radiopharmaceutical is via the bifunctional chelate (BFC) strategy, 
in which a disease delivery molecule (a.k.a. targeting vector) is 
covalently attached to a BFC. The BFC has the dual capability of 
(1) being chemically reactive for bioconjugation (attachment to a 
targeting vector) and (2) possessing a chelate for the stable attach-
ment of a radiometal ion (Fig. 1). The terms “chelator” and 
“ligand” are used interchangeably.

ques used for radiometal labeling, radiolabeling yield analysis,

tracer puriﬁcation, and quality control analysis. A selection of the 
most common and attractive radiometal ions have been selected; 
however, many of the methods described herein can be transferred 
to other radiometal ions. The general premise, which is described in 
detail in the Methods section, is to prepare a solution of chelator or 
bioconjugate in buffer, to which radiometal (typically in dilute acid) 
is added. Following incubation/reaction for a certain amount of 
time and at an appropriate temperature, the incorporation yield of 
the radiometal (% radiochemical yield, %RCY) can be determined 
by chromatography (e.g., thin layer chromatography, TLC, or 
high-pressure liquid chromatography, HPLC). If needed, the 
radiotracer can be subsequently puriﬁed (e.g., by HPLC, or size-
exclusion chromatography, or C18 plug), and quality control per-
formed afterwards. Radiolytic protectant may be added before the 
radiometal is added or after the radiotracer is puriﬁed.

Before we delve into the experimental protocols and technical 
details, pertinent background information has been provided for 
the reader so that one understands the importance of each step in 
radiometal labeling. 
1.1 
Radiometals and 
Considerations for 
Radiolabeling 
An important concept in radiometal chemistry is that different 
isotopes (radioactive and stable) of the same element possess effec-
tively identical chemistry. This means that the solubility, pKa, and 
ligand afﬁnity are the same. As such, if a non-radioactive isotope of 
a metal is available, we can prepare and study ligand complexes and 
expect that the behavior will be the same with a radioactive isotope 
of that metal. One factor that will be drastically different is the 
concentration, as the mole/mass quantity of radionuclides is tiny 
(e.g., nmol-pmol) and the ligand is always in excess. The oxidation

state of most medically relevant radiometals is not easily changed, as 
they possess high enough standard reduction potentials to be 
reduction/oxidation inactive in living systems; notable exceptions 
include technetium and copper. 
Radiometallation Chemistry
67
As radiometals are typically radiolabeled in aqueous buffers in 
varying pH and molarity, both the pH of the buffer and the pKa of 
the metal ion is very important. The speciation curve of a metal ion 
shows the pH ranges at which different hydrates/hydroxides are 
formed and can guide the selection of appropriate pH buffers for 
optimum solubility and radiolabeling yields. Many metal ions such 
as Ga3+ , In3+ , and Zr4+ have a propensity to form hydroxide com-
plexes at neutral pH ranges, which are insoluble and inhibit ligand 
binding. For example, the metal ions Y3+ (pKa = ~7.7) and Lu3+ 
(pKa = ~7.6) are not as acidic (less solvent activation) or prone to 
hydrolysis as metal ions such as Ga3+ (pKa = ~2.6) or Zr4+ 
(pKa = ~0.22) [1, 2]. A lower pKa value means strong solvent 
activation effects, which means increasing polarization of coordi-
nated water molecules and a decrease in the pKa of those coordi-
nated waters (more acidic). The full speciation curve of a metal ion 
provides more information; for example, above pH 2–3 the metal 
ions Y3+ , Lu3+ , Ga3+ , and In3+ still have a tendency to form insolu-
ble [M(OH)3] species. Zr4+ has much more complicated aqueous 
chemistry, where it tends to form a mixture of insoluble hydroxides 
(including hydroxo-bridged species) [2, 3]. The extremely small 
quantity of radiometal ions (~nmol-pmol) present in radiolabeling 
reactions render the system into extremely dilute conditions. This 
dilution allows even insoluble metal hydroxide species to retain at 
least partial solubility during radiolabeling reactions, which is one 
reason why gallium-68 can be radiolabeled effectively at pH 4–5 
even though its speciation curve would suggested only the presence 
of insoluble Ga(OH)3 at those pH ranges. As such, a majority of 
radiometals are typically formulated in solutions of 0.01 or 0.1 M 
HCl or HNO3 to ensure uniform speciation and prevent the for-
mation of insoluble hydroxides (zirconium-89 typically in oxalic 
acid, 1.0 M). 
Despite the possibility of forming insoluble hydroxide species 
above pH ~2–4, the buffers used for radiolabeling with a majority 
of radiometals are typically between pH 4 and 7. This is partially 
because at low pH (e.g., 1–3), the acidic coordinating groups of 
ligands (e.g., carboxylic acids: pKa ~  4–5, hydroxamates: pKa ~  9)  
may become protonated, a process which can disrupt the coordina-
tion of the radiometal. Further, secondary and tertiary amines can 
become protonated, forming positive charges which could repel 
radiometal ions as they are all cationic. The reason that zirconium-
89 is typically radiolabeled at pH 7.0–7.5 is because hydroxamic 
acid groups are typically used for coordination (e.g., desferrioxa-
mine, DFO), which have high pKa values of ~9–10 (some aryl 
hydroxamic acids being in the 8–9 range).

68
Caterina Ramogida and Eric Price
All of these factors considered together, the take-home lesson is 
that the pH of both the pure radiometal solution and of the radi-
olabeling buffer are very important and often need optimization to 
ideally match both the speciﬁc radiometal and the speciﬁc ligand 
being used. An ideal radiolabeling pH will satisfy the following 
conditions as much as possible: 
1. Be somewhere in the middle of the pKa values of your speciﬁc 
ligand’s ionizable functional groups so that amine protonation 
is 
minimized 
and 
oxygen 
deprotonation 
is 
maximized 
(although oxygen deprotonation is not strictly required for 
metal ion chelation). 
2. Minimize the formation of insoluble metal hydroxides species. 
3. Be gentle enough to ensure the stability of your conjugated 
targeting vector (e.g., antibody, peptide, nanoparticle). 
When considering these three general guidelines, the requisite 
reaction time for your speciﬁc ligand and radiometal are very 
important. Some targeting vectors might survive higher tempera-
tures or lower pH values for short periods of time, and an acyclic 
ligand with fast binding kinetics at ambient temperature, or a 
macrocyclic ligand at high temperatures can often afford quantita-
tive radiolabeling yields in ~5–15 min. Once a radiometal is stably 
coordinated by an appropriate ligand, it becomes mostly protected 
from water coordination and hydroxide formation and can be for-
mulated for injection at neutral/physiological pH regardless of the 
metal ions pKa value. 
1.2 
Bifunctional 
Chelators 
The role of the BFC in a fully functioning metal-based radiophar-
maceutical is essential. Ideally, the chelator should possess the 
following properties:
•
Ability to efﬁciently complex the radiometal under radiochemi-
cal conditions: the ligand should display high radiolabeling 
(incorporation) yields of the radiometal (quantitative is best) at 
low ligand concentration (sub-micromolar or lower) at mild 
temperature (ambient temperature is preferred) and quickly 
(preferably <20 min). Macrocyclic ligands typically require tem-
peratures of 60–90 °C to achieve quantitative RCYs and are 
therefore only matched with thermally stable targeting vectors.
•
Ability to form highly stable and inert radiometal-chelate com-
plexes: the resulting radiometal complex must be experimentally 
determined to be highly stable and inert. Can the complex 
withstand transchelation to endogenous metal-binding pro-
teins, and remain intact at the extremely dilute conditions 
encountered in vivo (μg-ng of radiotracer diluted into blood 
stream) [4, 5]? Macrocyclic ligands are typically more stable 
and inert than acyclic ligands.

•
Possess a chemically reactive handle for conjugation and cova-
lent attachment to targeting vectors: the conjugation should 
ideally be regio- and chemo-selective such that it does not affect 
the metal-binding properties of the chelator, or the biological 
target binding of the vector. Often, a carboxylate arm that is 
essential in metal binding is used in conjugation reactions via 
peptide bond formation with a primary amine of the targeting 
vector to form a carboxamide; however, this bioconjugation 
could alter radiolabeling ability and/or complex stability and 
so a careful assessment of these changes must be conducted to 
ensure sufﬁcient stability/inertness is retained. 
Radiometallation Chemistry

When choosing a BFC for a particular radiometal, one must 
consider the coordination number, coordination geometry, and 
donor atom preferences for the radiometal, which is tied to the 
metal ion properties such as atomic number, charge, and radius 
[6]. It is important to note that each individual ligand, whether 
macrocyclic (closed chained) or acyclic (open chained), will possess 
their own radiolabeling kinetics and properties with speciﬁc radio-
metal ions. The ideal conditions for speciﬁc ligands should be 
determined from literature, or if a ligand is new, from extensive 
radiochemical study. Several seminal reviews and summaries of 
BFCs in radiopharmaceutical elaboration have been published 
which outline the most appropriate chelate-radiometal pairings, as 
such the reader is referred to these works for further details [4–10]. 
Radiolabeling time and temperature is highly dependent on the 
chelate (e.g., acyclic vs. macrocyclic), and the vector (e.g., heat 
sensitive protein vs. heat impervious peptides). Typically, macro-
cycles such as DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-
tetraacetic acid) require radiolabeling temperatures of 60–90 °C for 
5–30 min, which is compatible with free ligands and most peptides; 
however, these conditions are not tolerated by antibodies, which 
should not be heated much above physiological temperatures 
(~40 °C), otherwise they may denature. When radiolabeled at 
temperature of 40 °C, macrocycles often suffer from lower radio-
chemical yields, and longer reaction times (e.g., 30–120 min). 
Acyclic chelators tend to complex radiometals with high radio-
chemical yields at ambient temperatures in short reaction times 
(5–30 min); however, the resulting complex may be kinetically 
labile. 
The commercially available macrocyclic chelator DOTA is by 
far the most promiscuous ligand in radiopharmaceutical design. 
This ligand often forms thermodynamically stable metal complexes, 
due to the macrocyclic effect, but at the cost of sluggish radiolabel-
ing kinetics, requiring elevated temperatures and long reaction 
times. These properties obviate its utility for complexing radio-
metals with short half-lives and/or when working with heat sensi-
tive molecules (e.g., antibodies). Nonetheless, DOTA is available

commercially in several bifunctional forms (Fig. 2), and its utility in 
radiopharmaceutical design is driven by its ease of accessibility and 
established radiolabeling protocols, rather than an ideal metal-
chelate pairing.

Radiolytic 
Protectants 
Radiation chemistry in aqueous media is complicated, but perhaps 
the most relevant process to radiochemistry and radiopharmaceuti-
cal production is water radiolysis. This is a topic that we believe is 
not typically discussed in enough detail, and it can have a profound 
effect on radiopharmaceuticals. Water radiolysis occurs through the 
interaction of high-energy ionization radiation with water to pro-
duce free radicals such as hydroxyl, superoxide, and solvated elec-
trons [11]. Generally speaking, the higher the quantity and/or 
concentration of radionuclide in an aqueous radiolabeling solution, 
the greater the extent of water radiolysis. The same is true of 
administering beams of high-energy X-ray or gamma-ray radiation, 
which is the principle by which external beam radiation therapy of 
cancer works. Similarly, targeted radionuclide therapy, which is the 
site-speciﬁc delivery of radionuclides inside of tumors, operates

largely via the production of free radicals through water radiolysis. 
The presence of oxygen increases the damage done to tissue by 
these free radicals, which could be a reason why radiation therapy of 
hypoxic tumors is less effective than for normoxic tumors (see Eq. 7 
below) [12]. As with other types of ionizing radiation, alpha par-
ticles can generate large quantities of free radicals as the ejected 
alpha particles (4 
2He2+ ) have an extremely high linear energy trans-
fer (LET, ~50–230 keV/μm) and deposit a huge amount of energy 
over a very small distance (~50–100 μm) [13]. Alpha particles are 
capable of directly inducing single strand and double strand DNA 
breaks; therefore, they are effective with or without free radical 
production. 
Radiometallation Chemistry
71
Radiation sources relevant to radiochemistry include photons 
(X-ray, gamma ray) and charged particles such as beta (β+ , β-) and 
alpha (α2+ [ 
4 
2He2þ]). Regardless of the type of ionizing radiation, 
the radiation chemistry of water for all of these is remarkably similar 
[14]. In brief, ionizing radiation creates a sparse track of ionization 
and excitation events, initiating a complex chain of reactions, 
beginning with a water radical cation [H2O]•+ and a solvated 
electron e– 
aq (Eq. 1): 
H2O þ ionizing radiation

For a single H2O molecule, the excited electron can originate 
from any of the ﬁve occupied H2O molecular orbitals, giving rise to 
a series of different [H2O]•+ excited states. These in turn can decay 
in a variety of ways by emitting photons or secondary electrons, 
giving rise to so-called ionization spurs in proximity to the primary 
ionization event and serving to amplify any chemical changes. The 
radical cation [H2O]•+ can react to give hydronium ions and 
hydroxyl radicals (Eq. 2) [14]: 
H2O
½
 • þ þ H2O → H3O

ð2Þ 
The resultant hydroxyl radical, HO•, a strong oxidizing agent, 
is a primary suspect for radiopharmaceutical degradation. Both e– 
aq 
and HO• are highly mobile entities [15] and can give rise to a range 
of other reactive species, for example, two HO• can react to make 
H2O2, and if O2 is present then this can be reduced by e– 
aq to the 
superoxide radical anion O2•- (Eq. 3): 
O2 þ e– 
aq ! O2 • -
ð3Þ 
Despite these complexities, most products of water irradiation 
are consumed through reactions that are effectively the reverse of 
those producing them, regenerating water and heat [14]. Thus, 
both [H2O]•+ and HO• react with e– 
aq to regenerate H2O (Eqs. 4, 
5) [14].

Although saline (0.9% NaCl) is an ideal solution for injectable 
radiopharmaceutical formulations since it is isotonic with blood, it 
is not ideal for storing these solutions, and high concentrations of 
NaCl present during radiolabeling reactions can exacerbate water 
radiolysis [16]. Chloride can react with hydroxyl radicals to pro-
duce hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a potent oxidizing agent 
(Eqs. 6 and 7) [17]. It is also possible to produce chlorine radicals 
through interaction of chloride with photons [18]. Recent meth-
ods for radiolabeling chelator-peptide conjugates with gallium-68 
have utilized high concentrations of NaCl for gallium-generator 
elution (~0.5–1.0 M NaCl in radiolabeling mixture) [19], which 
can lead to high levels of hypochlorous acid. This can cause radio-
lytic damage even to small peptides if a radioprotectant such as 
ascorbic acid is not used, even with relatively small quantities of 
activity (e.g., ~10–40 MBq). As such, high concentrations of NaCl 
present during radiolabeling or radiopharmaceutical storage/ship-
ment should be avoided, or it should necessitate the use of a 
chemical radioprotectant as a buffer additive. Stability of the mole-
cule/injectate can be assessed in-house via common radioanalytical 
methods described below (e.g., radio-HPLC, radio-TLC).

Radiolysis has been studied most commonly in biology as it can 
intentionally or unintentionally cause biological damage, and also 
in nuclear reactors for its deleterious effects on water cooling 
systems [20]. Although free radical production and radiolysis is 
desirable inside of tumors where biological destruction and there-
fore treatment of diseased tissues is desired, radiolysis is a major 
obstacle for radiochemists who need to prepare sensitive radiophar-
maceutical drugs in aqueous media. This is particularly critical for 
peptides and proteins containing amino acids such as methionine, 
which are highly sensitive to free radical damage [21]. Radioprotec-
tants are molecules that can be added to radiolabeling reactions to 
quench free radicals and inhibit the deleterious effects of water 
radiolysis. Radioprotectants such as ascorbic acid, gentisic acid, 
ethanol, and methionine are perhaps the best-known examples, 
and they can quench these free radicals and prevent damage, to 
varying extents and depending on factors such as concentration and 
pH [21–23]. 
The radioprotectants, L-ascorbic acid and gentisic acid, are 
perhaps the most well known. Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is typi-
cally 
added 
to 
radiolabeling 
buffers 
in 
concentrations 
of 
~25–200 mM [21–23]. A recent study investigated the radiopro-
tective effects of ethanol (10% v/v) and methionine (3.5 mM) and

found they were more effective over a 25 h period at preventing 
radiolytic damage to [177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-PSMA-617 (~62.5 MBq, 
~1.7 mCi, ~100 μL reaction) than both ascorbic acid and gentisic 
acid at 3.5 mM (~0.6 mg/mL and ~0.54 mg/mL, respectively), 
providing ~90% stability vs. 75%, respectively [21]. In this study, a 
combination of ~7% ethanol with 3.5 mM methionine was opti-
mum, providing stability of ~96%. Without any radioprotectant, 
these radiolabeling reactions showed stability of only ~25%, 
demonstrating the crucial role of radioprotectants. It is important 
to note that although 3.5 mM of ascorbic acid or gentisic acid did 
not provide adequate radioprotection in this study, a previous study 
with 
ascorbic 
acid 
demonstrated 
that 
concentrations 
of 
100–500 mM (20–100 mg/mL) were effective at preventing 
radiolytic damage to [90 Y]Y-DOTA-vitronectin peptide conjugates 
(37 GBq,100 mCi) [23]. Another study by Liu et al. demonstrated 
that with 20 mCi (~740 mBq) of [90 Y]Y-DOTA-RP697 peptide 
conjugate (0.5 mL total volume), concentrations of ~20–25 mM 
gentisic acid or ascorbic acid were not sufﬁcient to prevent degra-
dation over a period of 6 days, but ~110–130 mM was sufﬁcient 
[22]. Several recent studies demonstrated that for radiolabeling of 
DOTA-TATE/TOC 
with 
gallium-68 
(~300–1800 
MBq, 
~10–50 mCi), adding a portion of a 1.4% (w/v) ascorbic acid 
solution to the reaction mixture (~5–10 mg/mL, ~25–50 mM) 
was effective as a radioprotectant when radiolabeling [19]. A com-
mon example of ethanol being used as a radioprotectant is for 
2-[18 F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose [18 F]FDG, where ethanol is 
often present in the ﬁnal formulated product, although the effec-
tiveness is limited and recent studies suggest that more radiopro-
tection would be beneﬁcial [24]. 
Radiometallation Chemistry

Interestingly, another study compared the post-radiolabeling 
radioprotectant ability of histidine, glycine, tryptophan, methio-
nine, cysteine, gentisic acid, ascorbic acid, human serum albumin, 
and ethanol for stabilizing a lutetium-177 peptide conjugate 
([177 Lu]Lu-AMBA) [25]. These additives were all prepared at a 
ﬁnal concentration of 6.6 mg/mL (or 6.6%v/v for ethanol) with 
~83 MBq (~2.2 mCi) of [177 Lu]Lu-AMBA in a total volume of 
150 μL. Methionine as a buffer additive was one of the most 
effective at preventing radiolytic damage to methionine residues 
present in the AMBA peptide, but it was not sufﬁcient to offer full 
protection to the entire peptide. Although ascorbic acid and gen-
tisic acid were effective, 6.6 mg/mL was not high enough to inhibit 
all radiolysis. Interestingly, seleno-methionine was found to be the 
most effective overall for radioprotection of this particular peptide 
conjugate; however, quantities of 1–10 mg total seleno-methionine 
was tested and at higher quantities the radiolabeling yields were 
signiﬁcantly lowered. The ﬁnal recommendations from this com-
prehensive study were to utilize seleno-methionine during radiola-
beling (1 mg/mL) and to add ascorbic acid post-radiolabeling to

help stabilize. The authors state that seleno-methionine is safe for 
injection into humans, and ascorbic acid is known to be safe 
(vitamin C).

A recent study used ﬂuorescent dyes as optical markers to 
measure radioprotectant effectiveness against hydroxyl radical-
induced radiobleaching [26]. In this work, the authors used vari-
able quantities of indium-111, gallium-68, and bismuth-213 mixed 
with IRDye 800CW and radioprotectants, such as ethanol, ascorbic 
acid, or gentisic acid. Ascorbic acid was the most effective radio-
protectant in this study, with concentrations of 0.001–0.1% (w/v) 
being effective in inhibit radiobleaching from gallium-68 and 
indium-111 (20 MBq, ~0.5 mCi). The authors attribute the 
greater radioprotecant ability of ascorbic acid to its ability to 
quench two radicals per molecule and its very high rate constant 
for reaction with hydroxyl radicals (k = 1.1 × 1010 L mol-1 s-1 ), 
which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than ethanol or 
gentisic acid [27–29]. None of these radioprotectants could effec-
tively prevent radiobleaching from the alpha particles emitted by 
bismuth-213. This study did not investigate methionine or a methi-
onine/ethanol combination [26]. 
These examples suggest that each speciﬁc radionuclide and 
radiolabeling situation might require adjustment of radioprotectant 
levels; therefore, the concentration ranges reported here should be 
taken as guidelines with the expectation that some optimization is 
likely needed when applying to a new radionuclide/molecule. A 
special consideration for using radioprotectants is to always prepare 
the solutions fresh for each radiolabeling reaction. Although a 
radioprotectant solution might remain “fresh” for several days or 
even weeks, to ensure reliable protection they should be prepared 
fresh each day they are used. For example, ascorbic acid solutions 
will turn yellow/brown over time as it reversibly degrades into 
dehydroascorbic acid. 
Another important consideration for these radioprotectants 
include caution around their functional groups, with ascorbic acid 
and gentisic acid possibly causing interference when added to radi-
olabeling reactions with oxophilic metal ions such as zirconium-89, 
and so methionine or a methionine/ethanol mixture might be 
preferred. If any reactive functional groups (e.g., electrophiles for 
bioconjugation) are present on the molecule that is being radiola-
beled, methionine could be problematic due to the presence of a 
primary amine (good nucleophile). Organic solvents such as etha-
nol are used to elute radiopharmaceuticals from reverse-phase C18 
stationary phases such as C18 Sep-paks and C18 HPLC columns. 
As such, when ethanol is used as a radioprotectant, the ﬁnal reac-
tion mixture should be diluted with water/aqueous buffer before 
loading onto a reverse-phase media (e.g., <5% ethanol). Although 
ascorbic acid appears to be a superior radioprotectant to gentisic 
acid or ethanol alone, the ability of ascorbic acid to act as a mild

reducing agent (e.g., Cu(II) ! Cu(I)) means it should not be used 
with radionuclides of copper. 
Radiometallation Chemistry
75
Although a single study suggested that a combination of methi-
onine and ethanol are excellent radioprotectants, and adding 
methionine is effective at protecting methionine residues in pro-
teins at far lower concentrations than ascorbic acid or gentisic acid, 
radioprotection can vary greatly between molecules and radionu-
clides. Limited examples are available of methionine being used as a 
radioprotectant, and so its effectiveness with different radionuclides 
is not clear. However, it does appear excellent for preventing radio-
lytic damage to other methionine residues present in protein vec-
tors. Work with seleno-methionine suggests that it is far superior to 
regular methionine, and perhaps an ethanol/seleno-methionine 
mixture would be ideal for many reactions. As a post-radiolabeling 
additive for imparting radioprotection, ascorbic acid appears to be 
ideal. Ascorbic acid has also been shown to be effective for prevent-
ing radiolysis damage to antibodies during radiolabeling [30], but 
presumably seleno-methionine could be used instead (e.g., for 
zirconium-89 radioimmunoconjugate formation) with ascorbic 
acid being added post-radiolabeling during puriﬁcation and/or 
formulation.

Radiolabeling 
Yield Analysis, 
Radiotracer 
Puriﬁcation, and 
Quality Control (HPLC 
and TLC) 
Following a radiolabeling reaction, the radiochemical yield (%RCY) 
must be assessed; radioactive TLC (a.k.a. radio-TLC) and radioac-
tive HPLC (radio-HPLC) are the most common methods for this 
purpose. If the radiotracer may also need to be puriﬁed, HPLC, or 
C18 plugs (Sep-pak), or size exclusion (PD-10 desalting columns) 
can be used for this process depending on the type and molecular 
weight of bioconjugate labeled (e.g., small molecules, peptides, or 
antibodies). The premise of radio-TLC and HPLC is the same for 
non-radioactive chemistry, the difference being that a radiation 
detector is used to measure the distribution of radioactivity (num-
ber of counts) along the length of the plate (for TLC) or measure 
the radioactivity of the compounds in the eluate (in HPLC).

Radiolabeling 
Buffers 
A selection of the most common radiolabeling buffers can be found 
in Table 1. Radiolabeling reaction mixtures have typical volumes of 
10–2000 μL total. Thus, preparing 100 mL solution of buffer 
should sufﬁce for several radiochemical studies. Buffer solutions 
can be stored at ambient temperature for several months in prefer-
ably acid washed plastic or glass containers (e.g., 1–3% nitric acid 
bath, 24 h soak). 
2.2 
Radiolytic 
Protectants 
A selection of common radiolytic protectants, which can be added 
to radiolabeling reaction mixtures, can be found in Table 2. Radio-
lytic protectant can be added before the reaction begins (i.e., before 
the addition of radiometal), or after radiolabeling yield has been 
determined and/or after radiotracer puriﬁcation and formulation. 
Many of the radiolytic protectants can degrade over time in solu-
tion; thus, it is preferred that each radiolytic protectant solution be 
prepared fresh daily. 
2.3 
Chelates 
(Ligands) 
A selection of both commercially available and popular literature 
chelators employed in radiometal chelation can be found in Figs. 3, 
4, and 5. For simplicity, only the non-bifunctional (native) chelator 
structure is shown; however, in some cases several bifunctional 
derivatives have been tested and/or are available commercially. 
BFCs can be used on their own (native chelates for radiolabeling 
studies and complex stability assays), or conjugated to small mole-
cules, peptides, antibodies (MW ~ 150 kDa), antibody fragments, 
or attached to the surface of nanoparticles. Bioconjugation strate-
gies are not covered in this chapter, and here we assume the 
chelator has been prepared in appropriate form desired for radiola-
beling [5, 6, 8–10, 35–41]. 
1. Native chelates, small molecule or peptide bioconjugates:
•
Prepare a stock solution of chelator or bioconjugate: accu-
rately weigh ~1–5 mg of chelator or bioconjugate, dissolve 
in ultrapure water (see Note 4) or biology grade DMSO 
such that the ﬁnal concentration of ligand/bioconjugate is 
in the range of 10-2 –10-3 M (~20–200 μL).
•
For concentration-dependent labeling studies, using the 
stock solution from above prepare 1-to-10 serial dilutions 
of the ligand/bioconjugate with ﬁnal concentrations of 
approximately 10-3 –10-7 M. 
2. Antibody, antibody fragments, and nanoparticle conjugates:
•
Received in solution (e.g., PBS) at appropriate concentra-
tions (e.g., 1–20 mg/mL).
•
~1–2 chelators per antibody/antibody fragment is typically 
desired. Nanoparticles are dependent on too many factors to 
generalize.

Radiometals
Radiometals can be sourced from several suppliers (e.g., ITG, 
DOE, academic cyclotron labs), received as radionuclide generators 
(e.g., [68 Ge]Ge4+ /[68 Ga]Ga3+ generator), or made in-house with 
medical cyclotrons. A table of the PET and therapeutic radiometals, 
which are of focus in this chapter, are listed in Table 3. The radio-
metals will be formulated in dilute acid (most commonly

0.04–0.1 M HCl or HNO3). With the exception of [89 Zr]Zr4+ , the 
radiometal solutions can be added directly into radiolabeling reac-
tions without further preparation. However, if the speciﬁc activity is 
too high or volume of solution is too low to pipet accurate volumes 
into a reaction mixture, the radiometal solutions can be diluted 
with excess dilute acid (or whichever solution the radionuclide was 
formulated in) (see Note 5).

equipped with a binary or quaternary pump, UV-Vis absorbance 
detector (or equivalent), coupled to a radiation detector (e.g., 
inorganic scintillation detector) is required for HPLC analysis of 
radiolabeling reactions, or HPLC puriﬁcation of radiotracers. 
2.5.3 
Radioactive TLC 
Plate Reader 
A gas-ﬁlled continuous ﬂow proportional counter or an inorganic 
scintillation detector can be used for measuring radioactive TLC 
(radio-TLC) plates. The inorganic scintillation detector will be 
efﬁcient at measuring β-emitting sources, while the proportional 
counters will provide better sensitivity for low activity sources of all

types. TLC strips can also be chopped into sections (halfs, thirds, or 
quarters), placed into individual containers, and counted on an 
automated gamma counter to obtain an approximate distribution 
of radioactivity across the TLC strip if no radio-TLC reader is 
available.

General 
Radiolabeling 
Procedures 
A variety of vector-types are depicted in Fig. 6, such as proteins and 
nanoparticles, but any molecule or structure can be radiometallated 
if the appropriate bifunctional ligand can be stably conjugated. A 
number of the instruments and concepts that are summarized in 
this ﬁgure have been explained in more detail above in Subheadings 
2 and 3. Detailed methodologies for each step are outlined as 
follows.
•
In step 1, the exact buffer volume, pH, and molarity are custo-
mized to the type of vector used and the buffering strength 
needed to balance the acidic radiometal solution (e.g., gallium-
68 delivered in 0.05 M or 0.5 M HCl). If working with zirco-
nium-89, you would ﬁrst neutralize its 1 M oxalic acid mixture 
to pH ~7–7.4, typically using a sodium carbonate (1 M) solu-
tion. Therefore, for zirconium-89 even phosphate buffered 
saline is sufﬁcient buffering power. For those gallium-generators 
that elute in 0.5–1.0 M HCl, ammonium acetate at a high 
concentration of 1.0–1.5 M is often used as buffer (including 
radioprotectant) to neutralize the higher quantity of acid.
•
For step 2, the temperature is dependent on your vector/mole-
cule, but speaking very broadly, small peptides (e.g., <20–30 
amino acids) can often handle temperatures of 80–90 °C for 
periods of 5–30 min at pH ~4–7. Larger proteins—and certainly 
antibodies—do not fare well above 40 °C and those tempera-
tures should be avoided, unless you have speciﬁc knowledge that 
your protein/antibody will remain stable and functional at 
higher temperatures. Basically, the temperature of radiolabeling

is selected to provide sufﬁcient radiolabeling kinetics with your
chosen radiometal and chelator, while ensuring your targeting
vector remains stable.
Radiometallation Chemistry
87
Fig. 6 Stepwise graphical depiction of the full radiometallation process (radiolabeling with chelator-radiometal 
complexes), with major differences in analysis and puriﬁcation attributed to the type and size of the targeting 
vector (e.g., peptide, antibody, nanoparticle, cell). Step 1: The radiometal solution (typically 0.01–0.1 M HCl or 
HNO3, or neutralized 1.0 M oxalic acid) is transferred via pipet into the reaction vessel, which contains the 
ligand-conjugate (vector, e.g., protein). Step 2: The pH of the ﬁnal radiolabeling reaction mixture is checked 
and then heated with shaking. Step 3: Radiolabeling progress is evaluated by techniques such as radio-TLC 
and/or radio-HPLC (reverse-phase or size-exclusion) to obtain a crude radiochemical yield. Step 4: When the 
reaction is deemed complete, puriﬁcation is performed (if needed) using radio-HPLC (reverse-phase or size-
exclusion), stand-alone manual size exclusion columns (e.g., PD10), or centrifugal spin ﬁlters (e.g., vivaspin, 
amicon). Step 5: Final quality control analysis is performed to ensure puriﬁcation was successful and a high 
radiochemical purity has been achieved. Steps 6–7: The ﬁnal puriﬁed radiopharmaceutical is formulated for 
injection (e.g., sterile saline, buffered water) for administration/injection for any desired application such as 
imaging or cell studies. (Figure created using BioRender.com)
•
In step 3, the radiolabeling reaction is monitored to determine 
when it is completed, or if a standard protocol is being followed 
(e.g., [68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE) it is checked at the end of the 
prescribed reaction time. The two main techniques used for 
monitoring reaction yields (radiochemical yield, RCY) are

radio-TLC and radio-HPLC (reverse phase for peptides and 
small molecules, size exclusion for proteins and antibodies). 
Radio-TLC is fastest and often best for a quick yield analysis to 
know when to end the radiolabeling (i.e., completion). Radio-
HPLC adds UV/Vis detection as another dimension on top of 
just the retention time/factor obtained via radio-TLC, but 
radioHPLC 
takes 
far 
longer 
to 
run 
a 
single 
analysis 
(~15–30 min, ~5–10 min UPLC).
•
In step 4 it is time for puriﬁcation and this step is mostly 
explained in Fig. 6. A useful tip is that pre-packed PD10 col-
umns (GE, Sephadex G25) are the fastest way to purify large 
proteins (>5–10 kDa) from free radiometal and can aid in buffer 
exchange. Centrifugal spin ﬁlters (e.g., Vivaspin, Amicon) also 
work well to remove radiometals and small molecules/buffer, 
and can be purchased with molecular weight cut-offs ranging 
from 3 to 100 kDa. These should be spun down via centrifuge 
generally at 4 K rpm for the bigger 50 mL and 15 mL versions 
and 10-14 K rpm for the small microcentrifuge size, but read the 
manual as each brand/type has speciﬁc speed requirements! 
These spin ﬁlters should be re-ﬁlled with your desired ﬁnal 
buffer (e.g., injectate solution/buffer) and spun down an addi-
tional 2–3 times (which takes much longer than PD10). The free 
radiometal and other small molecules pass through the size-
exclusion membrane and are collected in the bottom of the 
tube. Both methods produce high-purity radiometallated-pro-
tein, but neither methods give you information about protein 
aggregates or if there is appreciable protein degradation into 
smaller fragments. To obtain this information, a ﬁnal size-
exclusion HPLC column/system (buffer is typically saline) 
must be used to observe—and if desired—remove lower and 
higher molecular weight impurities/aggregates. Final ﬁltration 
through a 0.22 micron syringe ﬁlter also renders the injectate 
sterile (if prepared under sterile aseptic conditions, e.g., GMP), 
but some vectors may be sensitive to 0.22 micron ﬁltration.
•
Step 5 is usually a re-injection onto an analytical radio-HPLC 
column, or another radio-TLC for quality control. Clinical tra-
cers might have other quality control requirements to test for 
things such as residual solvent or reagent and long-term pyro-
gen/sterility testing.
•
Steps 6 and 7 are up to the user to decide how to use this new 
radioactive imaging probe or targeted radionuclide therapy 
agent. Common applications are covered elsewhere, but include 
studying/treating cells, infectious bacteria, animals, tumor 
models, humans, and even the environment. Various types of 
drugs are commonly radiolabeled to study their pharmacology 
in animal and human patients (e.g., pharmacokinetics).

A—0.1% TFA in water, B—0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, 1 mL/min, 0–100% B over 20 min. Unchelated 
radiometal elutes at early retention times (tR = 3.9 min), while radiometal complex is retained and elutes 
later (tR = 8.2–8.6 min). Note that the radioactive chromatogram is slightly later in retention compared to the 
UV due to the radiation detector being placed after the UV detector in series. Highly polar species might also 
elute at the void volume of your column along with free radiometal, so a cold-standard is required to determine 
the retention time 
3.2 
Radiolabeling 
Yield Analysis 
A small aliquot of (approx. 1–10 μL, for radiolabeling yield analysis) 
or the entire radiolabeling reaction (for radiotracer puriﬁcation) 
will be injected onto the radio-HPLC system, and species are 
passed through and separated on a column (stationary phase) 
with a solvent or mixture of solvents (mobile phase). The concen-
tration of species that elute off the column will be measured by the 
UV detector, which is proportional to the concentration of solute 
present, and the radiation detector measures the radioactivity of the 
compounds in the eluate (Fig. 7). 
3.2.1 
Radio-HPLC 
The column packing used will depend on the nature of the 
radiotracer. Most commonly, for small molecule or peptide-based 
conjugates, reverse phase (RP) columns consisting of fully porous, 
silica microparticles chemically bonded with alkyl chains such as 
octyl-(C8) and octadecyl-(C18) are used which retain molecules 
based on their polarity. Mobile phases for RP-HPLC are polar 
solvents such as water, to which miscible organic solvents such as 
methanol and acetonitrile are added. Since protonation of metal 
complexes and biomolecules can affect retention time and resolu-
tion, the pH of the mobile phase is often controlled by addition of 
acid or base (e.g., 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid). The solvent strength 
can be varied by changing the solvent ratio of the aqueous (water) 
and organic (acetonitrile or methanol) solvents overtime, to create 
a gradient, or kept at a constant ratio for an isocratic method.

90
Caterina Ramogida and Eric Price
For large molecular weight conjugates such as monoclonal 
antibodies (MW = 150 kDa), size exclusion chromatography 
(SEC) HPLC columns are employed. SEC separates molecules 
based on their size by running the molecules through a column 
consisting of spherical beads containing pores of speciﬁc size distri-
bution. Separation is achieved when the molecules of different sizes 
are included or excluded from the pores within the matrix; smaller 
sized particles will diffuse into the pores more readily and thus will 
travel slower than larger molecules that do not enter the pores. As 
such, large molecules elute ﬁrst (shorter retention times). Since the 
elution of compounds is determined solely by their size, the solvent 
systems used in SEC are typically isocratic. 
For reaction monitoring, analytical (4.6 mm diameter) HPLC 
columns can be employed, while semi-preparative (10 mm diame-
ter) HPLC columns can be used in radiotracer puriﬁcation (either 
column is typically between 15 and 30 cm in length). For example, 
a C18 stationary phase (e.g., Luna 5 μm C18 100 Å, Hydro RP 
C18) can be used for radiolabeling yield monitoring and tracer 
puriﬁcation, respectively. 
3.2.2 
Radio-TLC
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) can be used to assess radiolabel-
ing 
and 
radiochemical 
yields. 
Small 
strips 
(approx. 
0.5–-
2 cm W  × 5–15 cm H) of paper or aluminum-backed plates are 
employed. Typically, a small aliquot (1–10 μL) of a radiolabeling 
reaction mixture is spotted at the baseline (retention factor, Rf = 0; 
approx. 1–1.5 cm above the bottom of the strip of paper), the spot 
dried, and the plate is placed vertically in a chamber containing 
mobile phase solution such that the spot is not immediately 
immersed in the solution. The TLC plate is left in the chamber 
until the mobile phase has sufﬁcient time to migrate up to the top 
of the plate (Rf = 1). 
After developing, the TLC plate can be read in a TLC plate 
reader (see Note 7). TLC plate readers will produce a chromato-
gram of the number of counts (y-axis) versus the position on the 
plate (x-axis) (Fig. 8), which can be used to calculate percent 
radiochemical yield (%RCY), or equivalent, by integrating the area 
under each peak. The quantity of radioactivity spotted onto the 
TLC strips is dependent on the detector used, where for Eckert and 
Ziegler AR2000 (previously BioScan) a maximum of ~1 μCi per 
TLC strip is ideal. 
If a radio-TLC plate reader is not available, developed TLC 
plates may be cut in half and the activity (counts) of each counted in 
a gamma counter (such as a Perkin-Elmer Automated Wizard 
Gamma Counter) and number of counts in each half compared. 
The cut-and-count method assumes good peak separation between 
the radiolabeled and unchelated radiometal. Typically the radio-
metal complex sticks to the baseline (Rf = 0), while unchelated 
radiometal migrates with the solvent from (Rf = 1); this is not

always the case and depends on the nature of the labeled com-
pounds and the mobile phase used, thus each system must be 
validated with proper controls prior to use. For a list of commonly 
used elution solvents (TLC mobile phases) see Table 5.

Conclusions
In summary, radiometallation chemistry is required to create 
radiometal-based radiopharmaceuticals and involves an intricate 
balance of many parameters. Key concepts have been covered 
including bifunctional chelators, coordination chemistry, water 
radiolysis and radioprotectants, aqueous chemistry of radiometals, 
buffers and pH considerations, and basic equipment and proce-
dural considerations. This chapter should provide the reader with 
both the requisite scientiﬁc foundation for understanding radio-
metallation chemistry, and practical tips and workﬂows for 
performing it yourself.

that may interfere with BFC labeling. 
2. Evidence suggests that radiolabeling in the presence of organic 
solvents such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile 
may 
improve 
radiolabeling 
yield. 
Recently, 
Ro¨sch 
and 
co-workers 
have 
shown 
that 
[68 Ga]Ga-, 
[44 Sc]Sc-, 
and 
[177 Lu]Lu-DOTA labeling yields can be increased at signiﬁ-
cantly lower temperature than 95 °C when binary water/ 
organic solvent mixtures are used [31, 32]; however, these 
conditions will not be discussed in this chapter. 
3. In general, buffers that can interact or bind with metal ions 
should be avoided, as these can interfere with radiolabeling and 
cause aberrant results. Tris–HCl should not be used for bio-
conjugations (-NH2). 
4. A small amount (~10–20% v/v) of ethanol or DMSO may be 
added in the case that the chelator/bioconjugate is not entirely 
soluble. Ensure that the percent of organic solvent in the ﬁnal 
radiolabeling reaction mixture does not exceed ~10% v/v, or 
<2–3% DMSO for antibodies. 
5. IMPORTANT: Maintain your stock radiometal solution in 
acidic medium, unless otherwise noted. Do not use buffered 
solutions to dilute radiometal stock solutions and only adjust 
the pH of aliquots that you plan to immediately use for radi-
olabeling. Neutralizing radiometal stock solutions can cause 
the formation of insoluble metal hydroxide species rendering 
your isotope unusable for radiolabeling. 
6. See Subheading 3.1 for important pre-conditioning and neu-
tralization requirements of [89 Zr]Zr4+ prior to radiolabeling.

7. For radiometals with several radioactive progeny (e.g., 225 Ac, 
212 Pb, 227 Th), plates cannot be counted immediately, instead 
TLC plates can be stored and counted after secular/transient 
equilibrium has been reached. Similarly, 213 Bi plates should be 
read immediately to eliminate interference from grow-in of 
grand-daughter 209 Pb (t1/2 = 3.2 h). 
8. The speciﬁed retention factors are for small molecule or native 
chelate structures only and should be veriﬁed for each 
radiometal-chelate pairing used.

Rapid Radiolabeling for Peptide Radiotracers 
Xiaowei Ma and Zhen Cheng 
Abstract 
Peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals (PRPs) have been developed and introduced into research and clinic 
diagnostic imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy for more than two decades. In order to efﬁciently 
prepare PRPs, some rapid radiolabeling methods have been demonstrated. This chapter presents six 
common approaches for PRPs radiolabeling with metallic radioisotopes and Fluorine-18.

Introduction 
Peptide-based 
radiopharmaceuticals 
(PRPs) 
are 
a 
series 
of 
radionuclide-labeled peptides that speciﬁcally bind to target recep-
tors related to biological processes of diseases, such as tumors, 
neurological disorders, and cardiological diseases. PRPs have been 
applied in clinical diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for over 
20 years. The advantage of high binding afﬁnity and speciﬁcity, 
good pharmacokinetics, ease of synthesis, and rapid radiolabeling 
has encouraged the investigation of a wide variety of PRPs targeting 
different receptors or enzymes, including ﬁbroblast activation pro-
tein inhibitor (FAPI) [1], somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) [2, 3], 
and prostate-speciﬁc membrane antigen (PSMA) [4, 5]. Peptide 
precursors can be synthesized using an automatic peptide synthe-
sizer and modiﬁed to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic charac-
teristics by changing peptide sequence and/or by adding a 
bifunctional prosthetic group, such as a small polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) [4], small peptide linker [6], or a small molecule [7]. Mean-
while, rapid radiolabeling methods have been developed to synthe-
size PRPs within a few minutes, depending on the properties of the 
conjugated chelator and radioisotope to be used. Fluorine-18 and 
radioactive metallic radionuclides (e.g., Galium-68, Copper-64,

Lutetium-177, and Technetium-99 m) are preferred for peptide 
labeling because they have a suitable half-life matched to PRP 
pharmacokinetics, mild labeling condition requirements, and 
good chemical properties that suit radiochemistry. However, 
there are many different chelators for metallic radionuclide labeling 
(Table 1). The radiolabeling approach mainly depends on the prop-
erties of the chelator pre-conjugated to the peptide, such as 1,4,7-
triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) conjugated pep-
tides are mainly suitable for 
68 Ga, 
64 Cu, 
90 Y, 
177 Lu, or 
Al18 F 
labeling 
at 
room 
temperature 
or

to achieve higher labeling efﬁciency and meanwhile protect the precursor.

6-hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) conjugated peptides are 
mainly used for 99m Tc labeling, and diethylenetriamine pentaace-
tate (DTPA) conjugated peptides could be labeled with 111 In at 
room temperature. It is important to remember that the attach-
ment of a chelator to the probe will impact the stability, pharmaco-
kinetics, and binding afﬁnity of the probe and, ultimately, the 
imaging outcomes [8, 9]. Thus, a proper bifunctional chelator 
should be considered when designing metallic radionuclide labeled 
probes. This chapter describes the general protocols of four popular 
chelators, DOTA-, NOTA-, HYNIC-, and DTPA-conjugated pep-
tides for rapid metallic radionuclides labeling and NOTA- and 
silicon-ﬂuoride acceptor (SiFA)-conjugated peptides for 18 F label-
ing. The structure of the chelators is shown in Fig. 1.

NOTA-
Conjugated Peptide 
with Al18 F Labeling 
Al18 F labeling strategy allows rapid one-step 
18 F labeling of 
NOTA- or RESCA-conjugated peptides in aqueous, which is suit-
able for some peptides that are thermosensitive. The following 
procedure describes Al18 F for NOTA-conjugated peptide labeling. 
1. Produce [18 F]ﬂuoride in a cyclotron. 
2. Precondition QMA cartridge with 5 mL of di-water at a ﬂow 
rate of 5 mL/min, then dry the cartridge with 5 mL air (see 
Note 10). 
3. Thaw out an aliquot of the NOTA-conjugated peptide. If 
needed, it can be diluted with 50–200 μL of 0.1 M NaAc buffer 
(pH 4.5). 
4. Transfer and trap [18 F]ﬂuoride on the Sep-Pak QMA cartridge. 
5. Rinse QMA with 5 mL of ultrapure water, followed by 2 min of 
air ﬂow (10 mL/min).

General 
Procedure for 
Puriﬁcation and 
Formulation 
1. Dilute the reaction, containing product, with 10- to 20 times 
the volume of sterile di-water. 
2. Load the solution onto a C18 light Sep-Pak cartridge. 
3. Wash the C18 cartridge with 10 mL sterile di-water. 
4. Elute the product from the C18 cartridge into a 15 mL ster-
ilized vial with 1 mL ethanol followed by 10 mL saline (see 
Note 12). 
OPTION STEP: Add 1 mL ascorbic acid or sodium ascor-
bate for some peptides that sensitive to radiation to prevent 
radioautolysis. 
5. Inject the elution through a 0.22 μm sterile ﬁlter and collect 
the ﬁltration into a sterilized vial (see Note 13). 
3.8 
Measure 
Radiolabeling 
Efﬁciency by iTLC 
1. Drop 1–2 μl sample (crude product for calculating radiolabel-
ing efﬁciency or ﬁnal produce for purity test) onto the start 
point (about 1 cm from the end) of the iTLC strip. 
2. Pour the iTLC mobile phase solution into a chamber until it is 
about 0.5 cm deep and covers the chamber’s bottom. 
3. Gently place the iTLC strip upright in the chamber. Cover the 
chamber and allow the solvent to extend up about 8 cm 
(or about 1 cm from the top of the strip). 
4. Carefully dry the strip and place it onto a thin plastic sheet set 
on the iTLC scanner. 
5. Start scan to get the radioactive count curve and calculate the 
radiolabeling efﬁciency and radiochemical purity. Radiolabel-
ing yield (or purity) = (CPM of radiolabeled peptide)/(CPM 
total) × 100%. 
3.9 
Measure 
Radiolabeling 
Efﬁciency by HPLC 
The radiolabeling efﬁciency and radiochemical purity can be 
measured by iTLC or by HPLC. The HPLC is more accurate 
than iTLC to detect radiolysis, and to detect unlabeled radionu-
clides and peptides for calculation of radiolabeling efﬁciency. 
1. Take a sample (10–100 μCi) of the sample solution and inject it 
onto the HPLC. 
2. Calculate the radiolabeling efﬁciency and radiochemical purity 
using chromatography. 
3.10 
QC Test
QC test should be performed according to the government regula-
tions. It usually includes radionuclide identity, radionuclide purity, 
radiochemical purity, chemical purity, visual examination, content 
of solvents, and sterility.

Radiolabeling of Peptides

Notes 
1. The labeling conditions described here may not be the best 
condition for producing highest yield and stabled labeling. 
Depending on the properties of the peptide, the labeling 
method should be optimized by changing buffer, pH, temper-
ature, and incubation time. Some reactions may need auxiliary 
reagents, such as sodium ascorbate, oxalic acid, and glycerol. 
2. For rapid radioactive metallic isotope labeling, the optimized 
dose of DOTA- and NOTA- conjugated peptides are different. 
Usually, 5–50 nmol could achieve high radiochemistry yield 
and good speciﬁc activity. It is highly recommended to elimi-
nate air bubbles when aliquoting peptides with nitrogen and 
then seal under nitrogen protection. 
3. 68 Ge/68 Ga generators are different based on the carrier mate-
rial (stationary generator phase). Thus, the concentration of 
eluent HCl may vary from 0.05 M to 1.0 M. The pH of the 
reaction solution should be checked before incubation. 
4. The QMA cartridge is usually preconditioned with 10 mL of 
di-water at a ﬂow rate of 10 mL/min and then the cartridge is 
dried with 5 mL air for Al18 F labeling. Do not dry the cartridge 
when it is used for SiFA-conjugated peptide labeling. 
5. The volume of the NaAc buffer could be changed according to 
the volume of radioisotope solution, usually equal to 10% of 
radioisotope solution. The same concentration of ammonium 
acetate (NH4Ac) buffer could be a replacement for NaAc 
buffer. 
6. The pH has a signiﬁcant effect on radionuclide labeled NOTA 
(optimal pH = 3.5–5.0, 4.5 is usually used as a start) and 
DOTA-conjugated peptides (optimal pH = 4.0–6.0, 5.5 is 
generally used at beginning). Thus, the pH should be opti-
mized to get a higher labeling yield. 
7. The 99m Tc-HYNIC-peptide labeling depends on maintaining 
the stannous ion in a reduced state. Therefore, the tin chloride 
solution must be freshly prepared. Nitrogen purge is recom-
mended to prepare all solutions for at least 10 min. To get the 
highest yield, the amount of SnCl2 should be optimized. 
Meanwhile, for 99m Tc labeling with HYNIC as chelator, addi-
tional co-ligands are usually required to complete the coordi-
nation sphere, such as tricine alone, or in combination with 
EDDA, ternary phosphines (e.g., triphenylphosphine-3,3′,3″-
-trisulfonate, TPPTS), or aromatic amines (e.g., nicotinic). The 
99m Tc-HYNIC/co-ligand
complexes
exhibit
different 
pharmacokinetic 
properties 
and 
biological 
stability. 
The 
99m Tc-HYNIC/tricine complexes are formed in high yield,

114
Xiaowei Ma and Zhen Cheng
but isomers are observed, and the biological stability is rela-
tively low. The 99m Tc-HYNIC/EDDA complexes are more 
stable and exhibit better homogeneity but require high reac-
tion temperature. Thus, the use of EDDA along with tricine is 
common to improve stability, homogeneity, and labeling yield. 
8. 99m TcO4
- volume also affects the radiolabeling yield. Usually, 
0.5 mL to 5 mL is sufﬁcient. 
9. For 99m Tc labeling of HYNIC-conjugated peptide, it usually 
achieves higher than 95% yield and purity. Thus, no further 
puriﬁcation step is needed for routine application. 
10. An optimal pH (4.4–4.6) is important to produce high-yield 
Al18 F chelation. A QMA cartridge in the chloride form instead 
of the carbonate form is highly recommended to reduce the 
pH change during elution since the QMA cartridge in the 
carbonate form usually generates a basic solution (pH = 11) 
after elution. 
11. The 18 F-to-Al ratio and the chelator-to-Al3 
+ ratio in the reac-
tion mixture positively affect the radiolabeling yield. An opti-
mal ratio is 50 mCi 18 F to 20 nmol AlCl3 and 20–50 nmol 
peptides. The amount of AlCl3 could be increased depending 
on the activity of the [18 F]ﬂuoride. However, higher amounts 
of radioactivity may cause increased radiolysis of the peptide. 
12. The concentration of ethanol of eluting solution could be 
optimized according to the peptide’s properties to reduce 
ethanol residue in the ﬁnal product. 
13. Some peptides may stick to the membrane. Different types of 
membranes could be tried to reduce product loss.

Methods for the Production of Radiolabeled Bioagents 
for ImmunoPET 
Alejandro Arroyo, Serge K. Lyashchenko, and Jason S. Lewis 
Abstract 
Immunoglobulin-based positron emission tomography (ImmunoPET) is making increasingly signiﬁcant 
contributions to the nuclear imaging toolbox. The exquisite speciﬁcity of antibodies combined with the 
high-resolution imaging of PET enables clinicians and researchers to localize diseases, especially cancer, 
with a high degree of spatial certainty. This review focuses on the radiopharmaceutical preparation necessary 
to obtain those images—the work behind the scenes, which occurs even before the patient or animal is 
injected with the radioimmunoconjugate. The focus of this methods review will be the chelation of four 
radioisotopes to their most common and clinically relevant chelators. 
Key words ImmunoPET, antibody radiolabeling, radioimmunoconjugate, chelator, 89 Zr, 64 Cu, 86 Y,

Introduction 
ImmunoPET is a novel imaging technique that blends two areas of 
science, immunology and nuclear imaging, taking advantage of 
each of their strengths. Rather than using small molecules, such 
as 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose, an radioﬂuorineted glucose (FDG), 
immunoPET uses the exquisite speciﬁcity of antibodies to deliver 
the radionuclide to a given target tissue. Antibodies are part of a 
class of proteins called immunoglobulins [1]. The speciﬁcity of 
these antibodies and other related targeted biologicals is crucial 
for the identiﬁcation of their target, enabling the precise detection 
of the disease site in the affected tissue [2]. Antibodies are 
Y-shaped, in which a highly speciﬁc and variable region is present 
in the inside part of the bifurcation. The potential for high variation 
gives researchers the capacity to customize the antibody to a speciﬁc 
antigen. Antigens contain deﬁned chemical signatures, which are 
usually found in the surface layers of xenobiotic agents, such as 
bacteria. However, antigens are also present in disease sites such as

cancer cells, where they can be detected by immunoPET. For 
targeted imaging purposes—be it optical, nuclear, or any other 
modality—antigens should be exclusively either expressed or over-
expressed, ideally in the cell surface, of the cancer cells, thus 
decreasing background signal in the resulting image and increasing 
the contrast between healthy tissue and disease.

Antibodies are not the only strategy for the development of 
immunoPET imaging. Other targeting strategies that have recently 
emerged include the use of antibody fragments such as minibodies 
[3–6]. These have the potential to decrease the blood half-life of 
the compound, thus reducing overall bodily exposure to the 
radioisotope. 
Several isotopes have been used for the development of immu-
noPET as an imaging technique in the clinical setting [7]. The 
focus of this chapter will be the complexation of four positron-
emitting radioisotopes (89 Zr, 64 Cu, 86 Y, and 124 I) to their most 
common chelators and the provision of adaptions from the litera-
ture with some chelate–antibody examples. The methodology 
described in examples below for each ligand, chelator, and radio-
nuclide combination could be seamlessly adapted to a variety of 
macromolecules where the described chelator–radionuclide combi-
nation is used.

Methods 
3.1 
How to Perform a 
Radio-TLC and 
Determine the 
Radiochemical Yield 
(Adapted from Zeglis 
et al. [13]) 
1. Spot 37 kBq (1 μCi) of the radiolabeling reaction mixture on a 
1 cm–wide silica-impregnated TLC strip (see Note 6). 
2. Allow the sample dot to dry. 
3. Gently, place the strip in a chamber containing the mobile 
phase (usually EDTA or DTPA at pH 5.5). 
4. Allow the solvent to run until the leading edge reaches around 
1 cm from the top edge of the paper (see Note 7). 
5. Analyze the TLC strip using a radio-TLC scanner (see Note 8). 
6. Radiolabeled immunoconjugates will remain at or close to the 
spotted location. Free unbound radioactive isotopes will travel 
with the solvent front. 
7. Calculate the radiolabeling yield of the reaction by integrating 
the radio-chromatogram using the following equation: 
Radiochemical yield of the reaction 
= Radioactivity isolated from the purified radioimmunoconjugate 
Radioactivity initially added to the antibody solution 
× 100 
3.2 
Getting Your 
Reaction Mixture 
Ready for Syringes 
If your reaction mixture shows a labeling of 100%, you may not 
need further workup in the reaction mixture to prepare the syringes 
(see Note 9). 
1. If your radiolabeling yield is not 100%, two methods could be 
used to get rid of the free radioactive ions in the reaction 
mixture: ﬁltering the reaction using a centrifugal ﬁlter system 
with an appropriate molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) or a 
prepackaged PD-10 desalting column to exchange the buffer 
system (see Note 10). 
2. Pipette the reaction mixture into the ﬁlter part of the centrifu-
gal ﬁlter system, add buffer to reach 500 μL, snap close, and 
place in the centrifuge with the appropriate counterweight 
(if needed). Run the centrifuge up to a maximum of 
14,000 × g for 10 min. Around 100 μL of radiolabeled anti-
body solution will remain in the ﬁlter part.

Production of ImmunoPET Agents
123
3. To check the purity and the efﬁciency of the ﬁltering part, run 
an iTLC of the antibody fraction to assure that there is no 
longer free radionuclide ions. 
4. Usually one to two washes through the ﬁlter gets rid of all 
free ions. 
3.3 
Preparation of 
Syringes 
1. The syringes can become a source of lost activity by attracting 
antibodies to stick to the plastic. A way to overcome this is to 
“block” or pretreat the syringes with PBS with 1% FBS. 
2. Running the radioimmunoconjugate solution through a 
0.2 μm ﬁlter is a good practice to assure that injection can be 
as sterile as possible. 
3. As a delivery control for immunoPET studies, an isotype con-
trol IgG similarly modiﬁed with the chelator and labeled with 
the radioisotope choice should be used for in vitro and in vivo 
studies. 
3.4 
Storing Antibody 
and Antibody 
Conjugates 
1. Upon receipt of the antibody, thaw and spin the vial to assure 
that any antibody present in the cap or in the walls is pulled 
down to the bottom of the vial. 
2. A good lab practice is to measure the concentration and com-
pare it to the one recorded in the documentation provided by 
the supplier or the collaborators providing the antibody. 
3. Freeze-thaw cycles affect the integrity of the antibody or the 
antibody conjugate. It is important to aliquot the bulk stock 
solution. A good rule of thumb amount should be to aliquot 
the amount that you would use per experiment. In other 
words, aliquot the amount of antibody that could be used in 
one in vivo experiment and freeze. Usually a cage of mice has 
5 mice, thus aliquots could be made to be used per cage 
of mice. 
4. The Abcam Antibody Storage guide notes that storing the 
antibodies in a -20 °C freezer vs a -80 °C one has no particu-
lar advantage. However, they recommend that antibody stor-
age should be in a freezer area with minimal ﬂuctuations in 
temperature (think the back of the freezer rather than 
the door). 
5. Once aliquots are thawed, they should not be refrozen. 
According to the Abcam Antibody Storage guide, these ali-
quots should remain stable and usable for 1–2 weeks when 
stored at +4 °C. 
6. If the concentration of the antibody or antibody-chelator is too 
diluted for either the chelator addition to the antibody or the 
radiolabeling step, a centrifugation step with an ultraﬁltration 
tube with an appropriate MWCO can help concentrate the 
sample.

3.5 
Further 
Considerations for 
ImmunoPET 
Experiments 
1. As a delivery control for immunoPET studies, an isotype-
control IgG similarly modiﬁed with the chelator and labeled 
with the radioisotope choice should be used for in vitro and 
in vivo studies. 
2. To determine the number of chelators per antibody, a MALDI-
TOF-MS 
analysis 
can 
be 
performed 
to 
compare 
the 
immunoconjugate vs. the unreacted antibody. 
3. For in vivo experiments, unlabeled antibody can be added to 
achieve a total mAb dose of 100 μg per mouse. 
3.6 
Making a 
Calibration Curve 
Calibration curves are a great way to determine the concentration 
of a sample by comparing with a standard measurement of stock 
solutions at a set range of concentrations. The way a calibration 
curves works is by determining the linear correlation between 
concentration of an analyte and a certain physical measurement 
such as absorbance. For this speciﬁc method, the Nanodrop will 
be the instrument referenced. 
1. Make 7 solutions of the desired antibody in different concen-
trations. Usually a good spread of concentrations should be 
between 5 and 0.1 mg/mL. For example: 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 
0.3125, 0.156, 0.08 mg/mL. 
2. Place 2 μL in the measurement pedestal and gently lower the 
arm of the instrument. The drop should bead up. If it ﬂattens 
out, the pedestal should be delicately cleaned with deionized 
water and a KimWipe. 
3. Measure the absorbance of the sample at 280 nm. 
4. Raise the arm, and clean the pedestal with water and a 
KimWipe. 
5. Repeat the steps 2–4 for the other concentrations. 
6. Once all samples are measured, plot the data in a graph with x-
axis “concentration” and y-axis “absorbance” and add a linear 
regression to determine the equation of the linear regression. 
7. The equation will be used to determine the concentration of an 
unknown sample. 
The ﬁgures referenced in the title of each complexation meth-
ods show a representative PET image of the probe.

2. Allow the antibody-DFO mixture to react for 1 h at 37 °C. 
3. Purify the reaction mixture using a Sephadex G-25 M PD-10

ered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 (see Note 12).

124 I-L19-SIP 
[26] (Fig. 11) 
Currently, the method of choice for iodination of antibodies is the 
direct radioiodination of tyrosine residues of the antibodies with I+ 
species created by oxidation of 124 I with oxidizing agents such as 
IODOGEN or chloramine-T [27]. 
1. Pipette 25 μg of IODO-GEN in dichloromethane in a scintil-
lation vial and dry the solution under a gentle ﬂow of N2 gas to 
achieve a thin coat in the bottom of the vial (see Note 18).

Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4, 218 μL of 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 6.8, 
142 μL (175 μg, 2.33 nmol) of L19-SIP, and 90 μL 124 I 
solution (38.5 MBq, 232 pmol NaI) and gently shake the 
mixture for 4 min at room temperature.

shake for 5 min (see Note 19). 
4. Transfer the reaction mixture to a syringe connected to an 
Acrodisc 0.22 μm ﬁlter and wash the reaction vessel with 
400 μL of 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at pH 6.8. Combine this washout 
with the reaction mixture in the syringe. 
5. Filter the solution through a PD-10 column using 0.9% NaCl/ 
ascorbic acid buffer solution (5 mg/mL, pH 5) as the mobile 
phase.

Coronal images were acquired at 24 (a) and 48 h (b) after injection. Image planes have been chosen where 
both tumors were visible. Uptake of 124I in the stomach (arrow) and to some extent in bladder (urine) is visible 
at 24 h post-injection, but has disappeared at 48 h post-injection. (This adapted research was originally 
published in the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, issue 36(8) [26]) 
7. Perform radio-TLC analysis using silica gel glass ﬁber sheets 
using 20 mM citrate buffer (pH 5) as a mobile phase. 
8. Run an HPLC of the ﬁnal product using a size exclusion 
column and 0.05 M sodium phosphate/0.15 M sodium chlo-
ride (pH 6.8) mixture at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min.

Notes 
1. Water should be distilled and deionized using a MilliQ water 
ﬁltration system or similar system to achieve the 18 MΩ-cm. 
2. If the compound is not dissolving, place the solution on a 
heating plate and increase the temperature. Heating up the 
solution will help to dissolve the compound if there are issues 
getting it into solution. However, it is important to wait until 
the solution cools down to room temperature (25 °C) before 
measuring and adjusting the pH. 
3. The buffer is now ready. However, due to the possible presence 
of heavy metals traces in the solution, adding Chelex to the 
solution will remove these contaminants that can affect the 
chelation steps.

138
Alejandro Arroyo et al.
4. When labeling biomolecules with radiometals, it is important to use 
metal-free or trace-metals-grade solvents and buffers to prevent 
the presence of any unwanted metal ions in the working solutions. 
These metal contaminant ions can compete for the same chelator 
as the radiometal, resulting in lower radiolabeling yield. 
5. Turn the stirring off and allow the Chelex resin to accumulate 
in the bottom of the ﬂask. There are two ways to remove the 
Chelex polymer from the solution, depending on the supplies 
available in the lab. One is to decant the chelexed buffer 
through a ﬁlter paper in a funnel in a clean ﬂask and allow for 
gravity ﬁltration. The other more faster way is to use a Milli-
pore ﬁltering unit (or similar device) to remove the traces of 
Chelex resin in solution. Though the Chelex should have no 
effect on the pH of the buffer, it is good practice to verify the 
pH of the ﬁnal solution. 
6. Silica-impregnated paper is very fragile—it can crack and crease 
very easily. Cut it carefully. Once cut to the desired width 
(between 0.5 and 1 cm should be enough), a dot of ink from 
a pen (we use red ink) around 1–2 cm from the edge of the 
iTLC paper—the sample should be placed around the same 
paper height. The color dot is used to monitor the progress of 
the iTLC. 
7. The iTLC chamber should contain mobile phase solvent 
around 1–2 cm from the bottom of the chamber. If a glass 
TLC chamber is unavailable, a 50 mL conical tube can be used 
as a replacement. 
8. To prevent the instrument from radioactive contamination 
from the samples, the iTLC paper should be covered with 
either cling wrap or paraﬁlm. 
9. Some chelations are reacted in a buffer that is approved for 
injection into mice. Each antibody usually has a speciﬁc buffer 
system that works optimally for mouse injection. Some mouse-
safe buffers are PBS and 0.9% buffered saline, among others. 
However, the buffers to be used in mouse studies need to be 
conﬁrmed with those approved in the animal protocol in each 
lab and institution. 
10. Rather than a quick selection between two methods, either one 
or both methods should be selected based on the situation. To 
inject into mice, radiolabeled antibodies should be the only 
source of radiation in the sample; thus, no free radioactive ions 
can linger in the solution. Free ions affect the ﬁnal images 
obtained as they usually have a different distribution to that 
of the radiolabeled antibody. For example, free iodine-124 
ends up in the thyroid, free zirconium-89 in the bones, and 
copper-64 in the liver, among other examples. Once the radi-
olabeled antibody solution is 100% radioactively pure, another 
question that must be asked is whether the buffer system the

Production of ImmunoPET Agents
139
compound is in compatible with in vivo tail vein injection. If 
yes, then the sample just needs to be diluted into the full 
volume needed, and then the syringes are prepared. If no, 
then a buffer exchange column (size exclusion column) should 
be 
run. 
Sometimes, 
if 
the 
biological 
probe 
(antibody, 
minibody, monobody, targeting peptide) is considered “sticky” 
(it easily gets adsorbed or stuck in the stationary phase), 
several ﬁltration steps might be a better option to prevent loss 
of product. 
11. Compounds like p-SCN-DFO can be tricky to dissolve in 
DMSO and, therefore, sonication or vortexing can be used. 
Ideally, a concentrated working solution of the chelator in 
DMSO will prevent the reaction solution to have a percentage 
of DMSO higher than 1–2%. When adding the DMSO solu-
tion to the antibody sample, a dropwise addition followed by 
gentle agitation reassures that the reaction solution remains 
homogeneous and the compounds are well mixed. This pre-
vents the chelator to crash out of solution, thus affecting the 
yield of the reaction. 
12. Pretreating your PD-10 column with the elution buffer is a key 
step in the puriﬁcation of both the modiﬁed antibody and the 
radioimmunoconjugate. Pretreatment involves replacing the 
solution in the column with the buffer appropriate for the 
antibody. Run around 20 mL of the antibody buffer through 
the column to get it ready for use. 
13. Adding EDTA to the reaction scavenges any unchelated radio-
nuclides in the reaction mixture and stops the reaction. 
14. The storage buffer of an antibody may not be optimal for the 
reaction to occur. Exchanging the buffer of an antibody using a 
PD10 column removes the buffer used for storage and replaces 
it with the ideal buffer for the conjugation step. 
15. Either buffer can be used and have been used in the past. The 
main goal of using these buffers is to get the reaction to pH ~7.0. 
16. Gentisic acid is used to stabilize and protect the radiolabeled 
molecule. 
17. Centrifugal ﬁlters are a very useful tool to concentrate antibo-
dies and other large molecular weight materials. These ﬁlters 
contain molecular weigh based size exclusion membranes 
that retain molecules larger that the molecular weigh speciﬁca-
tion while allowing smaller molecular weight molecules to pass 
through the membrane. Since the molecular weight of anti-
bodies and proteins is much larger than the molecular weight 
of small molecules and salts, they can easily stay in solution 
above the membrane while salts and water will pass through 
the memebrane, effectively concentrating the antibody con-
centration in solution upstream of the ﬁlter. And centrifugation 
provides the necessary force for solution upstream of the

140
Alejandro Arroyo et al.
membrane to pushed across the membrane. The ﬁlter mem-
brane size exclusion speciﬁcation should be carefully selected 
based on the molecular weight of the antibody or protein of 
interest in order to minimize the loss of product during ﬁltra-
tion. A good practice is to select a ﬁlter membrane cutoff 
speciﬁcation that is around half the size of your biological of 
interest. 
18. The vials containing thin layers of IODO-GEN can be stored 
under a nitrogen atmosphere for future use. 
19. Ascorbic acid reduces the IODO-GEN and protects the 
L19-SIP against radiation damage.

Radiolabeled Antibodies for Immune Checkpoint PET 
in Preclinical Research 
Milou Boswinkel, Gerben M. Franssen, and Sandra Heskamp 
Abstract 
Antibodies that block immune checkpoints, also called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have demon-
strated impressive anti-tumor efﬁcacy. The success of ICIs results from a complex interplay between cancer 
cells and their immune microenvironment. One of the predictors for ICI efﬁcacy is the expression of the 
targeted immune checkpoint, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Immune checkpoints can be 
expressed on tumor cells and/or subsets of immune cells. PET imaging offers unique possibilities to study 
the dynamics of immune checkpoint expression in tumor and normal tissues in a longitudinal manner. In 
this chapter, we describe the methodology to use zirconium-89-labeled antibodies to assess the expression 
of immune checkpoint molecules in syngeneic murine tumor models by PET imaging.

Introduction 
Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy have demonstrated 
impressive anti-tumor efﬁcacy, especially for antibodies targeting 
immune checkpoint molecules (immune checkpoint inhibitors; 
ICI). Immune checkpoints are expressed by various cell types, 
including tumor cells and subsets of immune cells. These check-
points tightly regulate the immune response and play a key role in 
maintaining immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. 
Tumor cells that (over)express inhibitory immune checkpoint 
molecules are capable of escaping immune surveillance and attack. 
ICI block the interaction of these checkpoints and thereby reinvig-
orate the anti-tumor immune response, resulting in enhanced 
tumor cell recognition and killing. As a consequence of its own 
success, numerous clinical trials are currently investigating new ICI 
treatment regimens. Although subgroups of patients show durable 
response, many patients do not respond, which leads to the search

for more effective treatment combination strategies. Furthermore, 
the treatment costs are high, and there is a considerable risk of 
immune-related side effects [1, 2].

Milou Boswinkel et al.
There is a growing demand for tools that allow the use of 
immune therapy in a more effective way by maximizing the likeli-
hood of response for the individual patient. Accurate pretreatment 
patient selection to identify responders from nonresponders is 
essential. Currently, the gold standard for therapy stratiﬁcation is 
immunohistochemichal analysis of immune checkpoint expression 
of tumor biopsies. However, various studies have demonstrated the 
limitations of biopsies, namely, sampling errors and the invasiveness 
of the procedure. Being noninvasive, sensitive, and quantitative, 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows for longitu-
dinal and repetitive assessment of immune checkpoint expression 
on a whole body scale [3–5]. The aim of this chapter is to describe 
how to use radiolabeled antibodies to study the expression of 
immune checkpoint molecules in syngeneic murine tumor models 
by PET imaging. We will discuss the selection of the right combi-
nation of antibody and animal model, antibody conjugation and 
radiolabeling, inoculation of the tumor cells, injection of the radi-
olabeled antibody, and, ﬁnally, the PET image acquisition, recon-
struction, and analysis.

Methods 
3.1 
Animal Model
This protocol describes the use of PD-L1-expressing Renca cells, 
which are derived from a tumor that arose spontaneously as a renal 
cortical adenocarcinoma in Balb/cCr mice (see Note 1 for more 
information about the selection of the right tumor cells and mouse 
strain). 
1. Prepare a solution of Renca cells to a ﬁnal concentration of 
2.5 × 106 cells/mL in PBS. 
2. Transfer the cells into a 1 mL syringe, and place a 0.6 × 30 mm 
injection needle on the syringe. Remove the air from the 
syringe. 
3. Restrain the mouse and inject 5 × 105 Renca cells (0.2 mL) 
subcutaneously on one of the ﬂanks of a 10–12 weeks old 
BALB/c mouse. 
4. Wait 
until 
the 
tumor 
reaches 
a 
size 
of 
approximately 
100–200 mm3 before injecting the radiolabeled antibody (see 
Note 2). 
3.2 
DFO Conjugation
1. Transfer 5 mg antibody (1 mL) into a metal-free 1.5 mL 
Eppendorf tube (see Notes 3, 4, and 5). 
2. Add 100 μL (1/10 volume) of 1 M NaHCO3 to the antibody 
solution. 
3. Add a 3- to 10-fold molar excess of p-NCS-Bn-DFO. 5 mg of 
antibody is 33.3 nmol, with a 3-fold excess of p-NCS-Bn-DFO 
corresponding to 100 nmol. To achieve this, add 50.2 μL  of  
p-NCS-Bn-DFO to the antibody solution (see Notes 4 and 6).

4. Vortex and incubate for 2 h at room temperature (RT) on a 
shaker. 
5. Transfer a 20–100 μL sample of the reaction mixture to a new 
tube for conjugation ratio analysis by SEC. 
6. Produce a calibration curve of p-NCS-Bn-DFO from original 
15 mg/mL stock solution. First, dilute the 15 mg/mL 
p-NCS-Bn-DFO to 1 mg/mL in PBS. Next, analyze a mini-
mum of ﬁve different amounts of p-NCS-Bn-DFO using 
HPLC SEC as determined by measurement of the UV signal 
at 280 nm (e.g., 0.2 μg, 0.6 μg, 1 μg, 4 μg, and 8 μg 
p-NCS-Bn-DFO). For HPLC conditions, use 250 mM NaCl 
in PBS as an isocratic buffer with a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min 
and a runtime of 30 min. Determine the area under the curve 
(AUC) and create a calibration curve using the AUC as a 
function of the amount (μg) of p-NCS-Bn-DFO. See Fig. 1 
for an example calibration curve. 
7. Analyse 20–100 μL of the conjugation reaction mixture by 
HPLC SEC. 
8. Calculate the conjugation ratio. First, determine the AUC of 
the peak that represents the amount of nonconjugated 
p-SCN-Bn-DFO in the reaction mixture. See Fig. 2 for exam-
ples of different conjugation reactions, where Reg#2 represents 
the amount of nonconjugated p-SCN-Bn-DFO. Use the cali-
bration curve y = ax + b, where y is the AUC of the unconju-
gated 
p-SCN-Bn-DFO, 
to 
calculate 
the 
amount 
of 
nonconjugated p-NCS-Bn-DFO (x). To calculate the conjuga-
tion ratio, substract the amount of nonconjugated p-NCS-Bn-
DFO (x) from the total amount of p-NCS-Bn-DFO (m) that

Reg#1 (retention time 7.9 min) is the UV signal of the monoclonal antibody, and Reg#2 (retention time 11.9) is 
the UV signal of the nonconjugated p-SCN-Bn-DFO. (a) Sample of the conjugation reaction before incubation; 
where none of the p-SCN-Bn-DFO is conjugated to the monoclonal antibody, conjugation ratio 1:0. (b) Example 
of the conjugation reaction during incubation, where part of the p-SCN-Bn-DFO is conjugated to the 
monoclonal antibody and a part is nonconjugated available; conjugation ratio 1:4. (c) Example of the 
conjugation reaction after extreme incubation, where almost all p-SCN-Bn-DFO is conjugated to the mono-
clonal antibody and only one molar part is nonconjugated available; conjugation ratio 1:9 
was added at the start of the conjugation reaction. Divide this 
by the total amount of p-NCS-Bn-DFO (m) and multiply by 
the molar excess (n). The result of this equation is the conju-
gation ratio.

11. Dialyze the sample in the Slide-A-Lyzer 20 K against 0.25 M 
NH4OAc buffer, 2 g/L chelex-100 buffer at 4 °C. Refresh the 
dialysis buffer every 12–24 h for at least 5 times. After exchang-
ing the last dialysis buffer, the total amount of buffer used 
should be a minimum of 5 L. 
12. After dialysis, transfer the sample into a new metal free vial and 
measure the protein concentration using a Nanodrop or 
spectrophotometer. 
13. Dilute the conjugated antibody to ﬁnal concentration of 
1 mg/mL in 0.25 M NH4Ac buffer. 
14. Store the conjugated antibody in aliquots of 100–200 μL at 4  ° 
C, -20 °C, or -70 °C, depending on the recommendation 
storing conditions of the antibody. 
3.3 
89 Zr 
Radiolabeling 
The following radiolabeling procedure is based on 20 μL of  89 Zr in 
1 M oxalic acid (see Notes 7, 8, and 9). 
1. Add to a metal-free screw cap vial 100 MBq of 89 Zr, and make 
up to a total of 20 μL in oxalic acid. 
2. Add to the same vial 9 μL of Na2CO3. 
3. Incubate for 3 min without closing the cap due to the produc-
tion of CO2. 
4. Mix well by pipetting up and down at least three times. 
5. Add 100 μL of HEPES. 
6. Add 100 μg of DFO-conjugated antibody. 
7. Close the vial and vortex. 
8. Check pH of the reaction mixture (should be around 
pH 7.2–7.5, see Note 10). 
9. Incubate the sample for at least 1 h at RT. 
10. Perform quality control using HPLC using a Phenomonex 
Yarra Bio-SPE-SEC s3000, or similar, and 250 mM NaCl in 
PBS as isocratic buffer (Flow rate 1.0 mL/min; runtime 
30 min). The elution time of the radiolabeled antibody is 
approximately 8 min. Use the radiodector signal as read out 
(Fig. 3). 
11. Alternatively, for Instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC), 
pipette 1–3 μL of radiolabeling mixture on a silica gel chroma-
tography strip. Place the bottom of the strip in citrate buffer, 
and wait until the buffer runs to the top of the strip. When the 
buffer has run through the whole strip, place the strip on 
tissues using tweezers. Be careful not to grasp the upper part 
of the strip, because this may contain radioactivity. Expose the 
strip (including the tissues) to a phopholuminescence plate 
(depending on the activity concentration, the exposure time

150
Milou Boswinkel et al.
ranges from a few seconds to minutes), and scan the plate using 
a phosphor imager. Calculate the fraction of radioactivity that is 
labeled to the antibody using an image analysis software, such 
as Aida Image Analyzer. The radiolabeled antibody remains at 
the bottom of the ITLC strip (Rf: 0.0–0.2), while the non-
labeled 89 Zr will run toward the top of the ITLC strip (Rf: 
0.6–1.0; Fig. 3).

Radiolabeling Quality 
Control 
If quality control shows that the labeling efﬁciency is below 95%, 
purify the sample using a disposable G25M sephadex column. 
1. Wash the column with 5 mL PBS. 
2. Add the reaction mixture. 
3. Wash the reaction vial with 0.5 mL PBS, and add to the 
column. The reaction mixture and wash should be completely 
absorbed by the column. 
4. Add a further 5 mL of PBS. 
5. Collect 10 fractions of 0.5 mL. 
6. Measure the activity of each fraction in a dose calibrator. 
7. Determine the radiochemical purity of the fractions by ITLC, 
as described above. 
8. Pool the fractions containing 89 Zr-labeled antibody with a 
radiochemical purity >95%. 
9. Determine the radiochemical purity of the pooled 89 Zr-labeled 
antibodies by ITLC or HPLC, as described previously. 
3.5 
Radiotracer 
Preparation 
1. Prepare the stock solution for in vivo imaging by diluting the 
puriﬁed radiotracer to a concentration of 10–50 MBq/mL in 
PBS (see Notes 11 and 12). 
2. The ﬁnal concentration of the antibody should be 150 μg/mL. 
If necessary, add nonlabeled antibody to reach this concentra-
tion (see Note 13). 
3. Optionally, pipet 10 μL of stock solution in 990 μL PBS. Store 
3 × 200 μL (injection volume) of this dilution. This is a 1% 
standard of the injected activity per mouse and can be used to 
quantify the radioactivity concentration in tissues dissected 
from the scanned mice. Make sure to use the same tubes for 
the 1% standards as for the samples that you intend to measure 
at the end of the experiment, for example, 5 mL round-base 
test tubes. 
4. Transfer the stock solution into a 1 mL syringe, and place a 
0.5 × 16 mm injection needle on the syringe. 
5. Remove all air from the syringe. 
6. Fill the syringe to a volume of 0.2 mL. Make sure that when 
ﬁlling the syringe, the needle does not touch the wall of the vial 
because this will cause the needle to become blunt and will 
make it harder 
to intraveneously administer 
the tracer 
(as described below). 
3.6 
Radiotracer 
Injection 
1. Transport the mouse from the housing lab to the imaging lab. 
2. Measure the body weight of the mouse.

152
Milou Boswinkel et al.
3. Measure the activity of the radiotracer in the syringe in a dose 
calibrator. Note the amount of radioactivity and time of the 
measurement. 
4. Put the mouse under a heat lamp or heat chamber to ensure it is 
warm and tail veins are fully dilated. Care must be taken not to 
place the heat lamp too close to the mice to prevent it from 
overheating. 
5. Put the mouse in a restrainer and stroke the tail by moving 
from a proximal to distal direction to further dilate the vein. 
6. To inject the radiotracer, grasp the mouse tail using the non-
dominant hand. Hold the needle of the syringe in the domi-
nant hand, insert the needle into the lateral tail vein of the 
mouse, and advance the needle a few millimeters. 
7. Inject 0.2 mL of the radiotracer and note the time of injection. 
8. Close the injection site using ﬁxation tape. 
9. Measure the activity of the empty syringe. Note amount of 
radioactivity and time of the measurement. 
10. Calculate the injected dose by subtracting the activity in 
syringe post injection from the activity in the syringe prior to 
injection. 
11. Transport the mouse back to the housing lab until PET/CT 
acquisition. 
3.7 
PET/CT 
Acquisition 
1. Transport the mouse from the housing lab to the imaging lab. 
2. Record the body weight of the mouse. 
3. Prepare the anesthesia machine by ﬁlling the isoﬂurane vapor-
izer 
and 
switching 
on 
the 
medical 
air 
delivery 
(2–3% 
isoﬂurane). 
4. Warm the PET/CT scanner bed to 37 °C. 
5. Once the induction chamber is ﬁlled with isoﬂurane, place the 
mouse into the chamber. 
6. When the mouse is fully anesthetized, place it on the PET/CT 
scanner bed, ensuring the nose is placed in the anesthetic nose 
cone. Next, change the concentration of isoﬂurane to 1.5–2.5%. 
If the mouse is breathing steadily, the isoﬂurane can be reduced 
further to ~1% for maintenance. The exact isoﬂurane concentra-
tion will be model- and strain-dependent. The respiration rate 
should be in the range of 60–100 breaths/min. 
7. Acquire a scout view to select the scan area for the PET and CT 
scan. Make sure the tumor and other tissues of interest are in 
the ﬁeld of view (FOV). 
8. For the PET acquisition parameters, set the radionuclide to 
89 Zr and select an acquisition time of 15 min (see Note 12).

9. The CT acquisition parameters can differ between scanners. 
For example, for the Siemens Inveon PET/CT scanner, the 
following settings can be used: 80 kV, 500 μA, 300 ms 
exposure time. 
10. To improve the accuracy of the image quantiﬁcation, attenua-
tion correction can be applied using the PET transmission 
method or CT-method. Although the effect of attenuation is 
limited in mice because of their small size (see Note 14). 
11. After the scan, turn off the anesthesia and place the mouse back 
into its cage. If necessary, put the cage on a heating mattress to 
keep the mouse warm while recovering from the anesthesia. 
When the mouse is fully recovered, bring it back to the 
housing lab. 
12. The imaging procedure can be repeated at different time points 
post injection. Typical time points where sufﬁcient contrast is 
visible between tumor and normal tissues are 24 h, 72 h, and 
168 h post injection (see Note 12 and 15). 
13. Euthanize the mouse after the last scan. Tissues of interest can 
be collected for ex vivo analysis, such as immunohistochemis-
try, or to quantify the concentration of radioactivity in different 
tissues. For the latter, weigh the dissected tissues and measure 
the samples in a gamma counter, simultaneously with the 1% 
standards as previously described. The results can be expressed 
as percentage of injected activity per gram tissue (%IA/g). 
14. Image reconstruction parameters are speciﬁc to each PET/CT 
scanner and require optimization depending on your applica-
tion. In general, we recommend a dynamic 3D iterative recon-
struction technique such as OSEM3D/SPMAP for PET and 
the modiﬁed Feldkamp algorithm for CT. The recommended 
output format is DICOM as this is compatible with most image 
analysis software.

PET/CT Image 
Analysis 
1. Transfer the reconstructed PET and CT scans to the image 
analysis software. 
2. Co-register the PET and CT scans if the alignment is not 
performed automatically. 
3. Tumor and normal tissue uptake can be quantiﬁed from the 
PET scan by manual drawing a volume of interest (VOI) using 
the PET or CT scan. Depending on the image acquisition 
settings and the image analysis software, the results are com-
monly expressed as Bq/mL, %IA/mL, or standardized uptake 
values (SUVs). If the output is only in Bq/mL, you can use the 
information regarding the injected activity dose, time between 
injection and scanning, and weight of the animal to calculate % 
IA/mL or SUV manually.

Notes 
1. Traditionally, preclinical PET imaging studies are carried out in 
immunodeﬁcient mice bearing human xenografts, using anti-
bodies that speciﬁcally bind the human target of interest. 
Often, these antibodies are not cross-reactive with murine 
immune checkpoints, which can be (abundantly) expressed 
on subsets of immune cells and other tissues. Therefore, huma-
nized mice or syngeneic murine tumor models are more realis-
tic models for the human situation [6]. In this chapter, we 
describe the methodology for syngeneic murine tumor models. 
Here, murine tumor cells will be engrafted in immunocompe-
tent mice. To image immune checkpoints, the used antibodies 
should be cross-reactive with the murine immune checkpoint. 
Selection of the cancer cell line used for the experiments 
depends not only on the type of cancer which is subject of 
the research (e.g., prostate cancer and melanoma) but also on 
the immunological status of the tumor (e.g., immunogenic or 
nonimmunogenic) and the presence of the immune checkpoint

of interest on the cancer cell (e.g., PD-L1 positive of negative 
tumor cells). After selecting the tumor cell line, the matching 
mouse strain should be selected. For example, the immuno-
genic 
melanoma 
cell 
line 
B16F10 
originates 
from 
C57/Bl6 mice. 
2. The uptake of the radiolabeled antibody can be inﬂuenced by 
tumour growth rate and size. Murine tumor cells tend to 
develop very rapidly and large tumors might have a poorer 
vascularization and a higher interstitial ﬂuid pressure. This 
can hamper the penetration of the antibody into a large 
tumor, even though the immune checkpoint is expressed. 
Therefore, it is important to start experiments with relatively 
small tumors (100–200 mm3 ) and to make sure that tumor 
sizes are comparable between groups and experiments. Fur-
thermore, it is important to ensure that the injected tumor 
cells are viable. The presence of many dead tumor cells during 
tumor cell inoculation can initiate an anti-tumor immune 
response, which will delay or even prevent the formation of a 
tumor. 
3. The most commonly used chelator to label antibodies with 
89 Zr is DFO. This combination has been applied widely in 
preclinical and clinical research. However, a drawback is that a 
fraction of the 89 Zr is released from DFO, resulting in accumu-
lation of 89 Zr in mineral bone. This may hamper the detection 
of bone metastases and could result in undesired radiation dose 
to bone marrow. Release of 89 Zr is the result of suboptimal 
complexation, as 89 Zr4+ demands octacoordination to form 
stable complexes, while the three hydroximate groups of 
DFO only offer hexacoordination. To overcome this, several 
new chelators and new labeling strategies have been developed, 
such as 89 ZrCl4 for 89 Zr complexation using DOTA. However, 
a drawback of this approach is the temperature required for 
efﬁcient complexation (95 °C), which is a limiting factor for 
antibodies. Recently, newly developed chelators such as DFO*-
NCS, DFO-cyclo*-pPhe-NCS, or p-SCN-Bn-HOPO showed 
improved retention of 89 Zr. Nowadays, DFO*-NCS is com-
mercially available. Clinical studies will have to demonstrate the 
relevance of these preclinical ﬁndings in the clinical setting 
[7–11]. 
4. The concentration of the antibody is preferable between 2.5 
and 10 mg/mL to increase the chance of an effective conjuga-
tion reaction. The ratio of antibody to p-NCS-Bz-DFO can be 
varied in case the reaction is very inefﬁcient. The preferred 
conjugation ratio is around 2 chelators per antibody. More 
chelators per antibody could potentially inﬂuence the antigen 
binding properties or clearance rate of the antibody, while less 
chelators might result in inefﬁcient 89 Zr-labeling.

156
Milou Boswinkel et al.
5. Avoid metal contaminations of ﬁlter tips and vials to prevent 
incorporation of metals in p-NCS-Bn-DFO, as this will disturb 
the radiolabeling with 89 Zr: Use metal-free plastics and ﬁlter 
tips for pipetting, or remove unwanted metals by washing 
plastics overnight in 2 M HCl, followed by 2 washing steps 
with metalfree water and subsequent drying of the plastics. Use 
metal-free buffers, with metals removed through the addition 
of 2 g/L chelex. After overnight incubation, chelex should be 
removed with, for example, a 0.2 μm ﬁlter. 
6. p-NCS-Bn-DFO is a bifunctional chelator that can be coupled 
rapidly and efﬁciently to the lysine-NH2 groups of antibodies. 
The protocol has been extensively described by Vosjan et al. 
[12] An alternative approach is to use N-succinyldesferrioxa-
mine B (N-sucDf). However, this chelator requires a more 
complex multi-step procedure [13]. 
7. The radiolabeling as described under Subheading 3.3. can be 
adjusted, for example, if a different amount of antibody or 
radioactivity is need. However, it is important to keep the 
volume ratios the same. A volume of 20 μL of  89 Zr in 1 M 
oxalic acid is the minimal starting volume. 
8. Next to positrons, 89 Zr emits high energy gammas of 909 keV. 
Shield them with lead and work in a ﬂow hood for radiation 
protection purposes. 
9. At the moment, 89 Zr is the most commonly used radionuclide 
for PET imaging with radiolabeled antibodies. It has favorable 
characteristics: Its half-life of 78.4 h matches the tissue kinetics 
of antibodies, it is a residualizing radionuclide that provides 
high-contrast images, and its positrons have a relatively low 
energy, which results in high-resolution PET images. There-
fore, 89 Zr is preferred over other long-lived positron emitters, 
such as 124 I [14]. 
10. To achieve efﬁcient labeling with 89 Zr, the pH of the reaction 
mixture should be between pH 7.2–7.5. The pH of reaction 
mixture may differ depending on, for example, the time 
between irradiation and performing the radiolabeling. Always 
check the pH and adjust if necessary. 
11. To prevent adverse reactions when injecting the radiolabeled 
antibody in mice, it is important that the solution is pH neutral 
and physiological (e.g., physiological saline) and/or isotonic 
with blood (e.g., PBS). Furthermore, the solution should not 
contain proteins such as bovine serum albumin. If necessary, 
add 1/10 volume of 10× concentrated PBS to achieve a pH 
neutral and isotonic solution. Also, prevent the use bovine 
serum albumin during the puriﬁcation process. 
12. The minimum amount of 89 Zr injected per mouse depends on 
time between injection and scanning, total scan time, and

Immune Checkpoint Imaging
157
sensitivity of the PET scanner. On average, 5 MBq/mouse is 
sufﬁcient for PET imaging 1–7 days post injection, using an 
acquisition time of 15–30 min. This will result in sufﬁcient 
counts to reconstruct a representative image. However, in 
case the sensitivity of the scanner is for example very high, 
lower amounts of activity can be administered. 
13. The circulation time and in vivo distribution of radiolabeled 
antibodies directed against immune checkpoints is often dose-
dependent. For example, PD-L1 is not only expressed on 
tumor cells but also on subsets of immune cells in lymphoid 
tissues, such as the spleen and lymph nodes. At low antibody 
concentrations, PD-L1 antibodies are rapidly cleared from the 
circulation by binding to PD-L1 positive immune cells in the 
spleen. Therefore, the spleen acts as a so-called sink organ and 
prevents the antibody from reaching PD-L1 in the tumor. By 
increasing the amount of injected antibody the PD-L1-
mediated uptake in the spleen can be saturated, resulting in 
increased levels of circulating antibody and, as a consequence, 
increased tumor uptake. The optimal antibody dose is target 
and model dependent. For PD-L1, the optimal amount is in 
the range of 20–50 μg [15, 16]. 
14. In humans, attenuation correction is required to obtain quan-
titative PET data. However, this is less of a problem in preclini-
cal research because of the small size of mice. In case it is 
desirable to perform attenuation correction, the two most 
common methods are PET-based, by acquiring a transmission 
scan using a 57 Co-point source, or CT-based [17, 18]. 
15. Repeated anesthesia within short time intervals can cause sig-
niﬁcant discomfort for the mouse. Ensure that body tempera-
ture remains constant during the scan by using a proper 
heating mattress during the scan and keep the animals warm 
when recovering from the anesthesia. A drop in body tempera-
ture affects the anesthesia making it more effective. If the 
animal cools down too much, it may take longer for it to 
recover and it may increase the discomfort.

Radiolabeled Afﬁbody Molecules for PET Imaging 
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek 
Abstract 
Owing to their ease of engineering and production, chemical stability, size, and high target afﬁnity and 
speciﬁcity, radiolabeled afﬁbody molecules have been recognized as very promising molecular imaging 
probes in both preclinical and clinical settings. Herein we describe the methods for the preparation of 
afﬁbody-chelator conjugates and their subsequent radiolabeling with 18 F-AlF, 68 Ga, 89 Zr. 
Key words Conjugation, chelators, 
18 F-AlF, 68 Ga, 89 Zr

Introduction 
Afﬁbody molecules are a class of small (approximately 58 amino 
acids, 6.5–7 kDa) nonimmunoglobulin afﬁnity proteins generated 
by combinatorial protein engineering [1]. By randomizing 13 
amino acids on two of the three-helix bundle, large libraries can 
be generated, from which potent binders can be isolated by a variety 
of display methods [2]. The selected binders have a high target 
speciﬁcity and binding afﬁnity (KD in the low-nanomolar to pico-
molar range) [3]. A large variety of afﬁbody molecules toward 
major cancer-associated molecular targets (e.g., EGFR, HER2, 
HER3, VEGFR, PD-L1) have been selected and radiolabeled 
with positron emitters such as 18 F [4–11], 68 Ga [12–16], 64 Cu 
[17, 18], and 89 Zr [19–21]. When radiometals (e.g., 68 Ga, 89 Zr) 
or radioactive metal-halogen complexes (i.e., 18 F-AlF) are used, the 
attachment of a suitable chelator to the protein must be carried out 
prior to radiolabeling. The site-speciﬁc conjugation of chelators 
(as well as dyes) to the afﬁbody molecule can be achieved by 
introducing a unique cysteine residue at its C-terminus [1]. The 
quick and straightforward maleimide–thiol conjugation reaction is 
usually performed to prepare afﬁbody-based conjugates [22]. High 
product yields can be achieved through a one-pot reaction contain-
ing the afﬁbody molecule (that is most likely present as a dimer in

solution), maleimide-bearing chelator, and tris(2-carboxyethyl) 
phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) as the reducing agent 
required to restore the reactive monomeric-free sulfhydryl form 
of the protein [8]. Importantly, afﬁbody molecules are character-
ized by high chemical and thermic stability, allowing the protein 
conjugates to be radiolabeled at high temperatures (up to 95 °C) 
without compromising the structural integrity and the target rec-
ognition ability of the radioconjugate [23]. Additionally, afﬁbody 
molecules are compatible with a broad range of pH and organic 
solvents used during the radiolabeling reaction and puriﬁcation 
step (e.g., ethanol, DMSO) [24]. All these properties make the 
molecules attractive vectors for imaging purposes (Fig. 1).

Materials 
Prepare all aqueous solutions using either ultrapure water or water 
for injection and analytical grade reagents. Use Reagent or ACS 
grade organic solvents. Prepare and store buffers and solutions at 
room temperature, if not stated otherwise. Follow the local waste 
disposal indications when discarding waste material. A metal-free 
environment is preferable when working with radiometals. For this 
reason, the use of plastic spatulas (instead of metal ones) and plastic 
vials (instead of glass ones) is recommended. 
The described procedure are suitable for the preparation of 
afﬁbody conjugates and their radiolabeled products for preclinical 
use only. 
2.1 
Conjugation 
Reaction 
1. The afﬁbody molecule is delivered either as a lyophilized pow-
der or in solution in a buffer established by the manufacturer 
based on the solubility of the protein. In the latter case, the 
concentration of the afﬁbody molecule stock solution can vary 
depending on the production batch and will be indicated, as 
well as the buffer constituency, in the delivery sheet sent by the 
supplier. Store at -20 °C. Prepare a 1.2–1.5 mg/mL afﬁbody 
molecule solution (see Note 1) by either dissolving the lyophi-
lized afﬁbody molecule in a suitable volume of buffer (e.g., 
PBS; see Note 2) or by diluting the supplied stock solution with 
an appropriate volume of buffer (e.g., PBS). For example: mix 
300 μL of a 2.3 mg/mL solution of afﬁbody molecule with 
250 μL of PBS (see Note 3). 
2. 50 mg/mL TCEP-HCl, pH 5.0–5.5 (see Note 4): Weigh 5 mg 
of TCEP-HCl and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
Add 100 μL of PBS and mix. Since TCEP is not particularly 
stable in phosphate buffers, this solution should be freshly 
prepared immediately before use. Do not store it. 
3. 0.1 M Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA): Dissolve 
1.46 mg of EDTA in 50 mL of water. 
4. Maleimide functionalised chelators (i.e., NOTA-maleimide, 
DOTA-maleimide, deferoxamine-maleimide): Purchase from 
either CheMatech or Macrocyclics. Store at -20 °C. Freshly 
prepare a chelator-maleimide stock solution (e.g., 10 mM in 
buffer or DMSO depending on solubility; see Note 5). 
5. Low-protein binding 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. 
6. pH meter.

One-Pot 
Conjugation Reaction 
(See Note 9) 
The following procedure is suitable for the conjugation of any 
maleimide 
functionalysed 
chelators 
(e.g., 
DOTA-maleimide, 
NOTA-maleimide, DFO-maleimide) to any cysteine-bearing afﬁ-
body molecule. 
1. Transfer an appropriate volume of the afﬁbody molecule solu-
tion (1 equiv.) into a 1.5 mL low-protein binding microcen-
trifuge tube and add a volume of 0.1 M EDTA (see Note 10)

Fig. 2 Overlay of representative RP-HPLC traces for the afﬁbody dimer (black line; elution at approximately 
12 min:s), monomer (red line; elution at approximately 10:80 min:s; reduction reaction mixture containing 
TCEP eluting at 3 min:s), and NOTA-afﬁbody conjugate in the conjugation reaction mixture (blue line; elution at 
approximately 10:50 min:s; presence of TCEP eluting at 3 min:s). The absorbance was measured at the 
wavelength of 230 nm 
solution corresponding to 60–90 equiv. Incubate for 30 min at 
room temperature. 
2. To the afﬁbody molecule solution, add a volume of the fresh 
50 mg/mL TCEP-HCl stock solution corresponding to a 
25 molar excess (see Note 11). 
3. Incubate the mixture at 85 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 min at 
24 °C with gentle shaking in a thermoshaker (see Note 12). 
4. Add 
an 
amount 
of 
maleimide 
functionalised 
chelator 
corresponding to a 40 molar excess to the protein solution 
(see Note 5). 
5. Incubate the reaction mixture at 40 °C for 2 h with gentle 
shaking (see Note 13). 
6. Take a sample of the reaction mixture and analyze it by analyti-
cal RP-HPLC. Inject 7–10 μg of protein. The presence of the 
product peak and the disappearance of the unconjugated afﬁ-
body molecule peak (both monomer and dimer) indicate that 
the conjugation reaction has reached completion (Fig. 2). 
7. Purify the conjugate by semipreparative RP-HPLC to remove 
any residual free chelator and TCEP. Collect the product peak 
from the column output.

168
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
8. Evaporate the solvent of the collected fractions containing the 
product (e.g., using a lyophilizer or a centrifugal concentrator) 
and re-dissolve the conjugate in a known volume of water to 
have a concentration of 0.4–1.0 mg/mL. 
9. Measure the concentration of the conjugate by UV-VIS spec-
troscopy (see Note 6). 
10. Characterize the products by RP-HPLC and mass spectrome-
try (e.g., MALDI or ESI). 
11. Store the conjugate stock solution at -20 °C until needed. 
Alternatively, divide the bioconjugate solution into aliquots, 
containing an amount of protein according to the radiolabeling 
reaction requirements (e.g., 10–15 nmol). Lyophilize the ali-
quots. The solid afﬁbody conjugate can be stored at -20 °C 
until needed. 
3.2 
18 F-AlF 
Radiolabeling 
The following procedure is suitable for the manual 18 F-AlF radi-
olabeling (see Note 14) of any afﬁbody-conjugates containing pen-
tadentate macrocyclic chelators, such as NOTA (see Note 15). 
1. To the NOTA-afﬁbody conjugate (solid or in solution, 
10–15 nmol), add a 2 mM solution of AlCl3 (1:0.8 protein to 
AlCl3 molar ratio) and 2–5 μL of 0.5 M sodium acetate (see 
Notes 7 and 16). 
2. Add nonpuriﬁed aqueous 18 F-ﬂuoride (300–500 MBq). Alter-
natively, the aqueous 18 F-ﬂuoride can be puriﬁed from target 
generated impurities (e.g., various radionuclides and metals) 
through a quaternary methyl ammonium (QMA) SPE car-
tridge before it is added to the reaction. For that purpose, 
equilibrate a commercially available Sep-Pak QMA-SPE car-
tridge (130 mg sorbent) with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl, followed 
by a 5 mL water rinse. Meanwhile, prepare a 0.36% NaCl 
solution by diluting the commercially available 0.9% NaCl 
solution with water (1:2.5 v/v). Preferably using a syringe 
drive or an automated synthesiser, transfer the 
18 F target 
wash (0.5–2 GBq in water) onto the QMA cartridge. To ensure 
the removal of possible longer-lived contaminants, wash the 
QMA with 2 ml water. Finally, recover the 18 F-ﬂuoride by 
eluting the QMA cartridge with 0.5 mL of 0.36% NaCl into a 
1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add puriﬁed aqueous 18 F-ﬂuo-
ride (300–500 MBq) to the conjugate buffered solution. 
3. Take a small aliquot (approximately 0.5 μL) of the solution, 
and test the pH on a pH strip. It should be 4 (see Note 17). 
4. Add a volume of organic solvent (e.g., ethanol, acetonitrile, 
DMSO, DMF) equal to the volume of the aqueous solution 
(see Notes 18 and 19). Measure the radioactivity of the mixture 
using a dose calibrator. 
5. Incubate the solution at 95 °C for 15 min. 
6. Purify the product by RP-HPLC: Inject the whole reaction 
solution into an analytical wide pore C18 HPLC column, and

(right) 
collect the eluate corresponding to the product peak in a 20 mL 
glass/plastic vial containing 3 mL of aqueous 0.1% TFA. Leave 
the rest go to waste (see Notes 20 and 21). 
7. Collect the product solution with a 5 mL disposable syringe, 
and load it onto the previously prepared HLB-SPE cartridge. 
Discard the eluate (see Note 22). 
8. Wash the cartridge with 3 mL aqueous 0.1% TFA, followed by 
3 mL water. Discard the washings (they should contain just free 
18 F-ﬂuoride) after measuring the activity in a dose calibrator. 
9. Elute the product with 130–150 μL of a mixture of ethanol and 
water (see Note 23), and collect it in a 1.5 mL low-protein 
binding vial. 
10. Determine the protein concentration, in the product solution, 
by UV-VIS spectroscopy (see Note 6), and measure the 
radioactivity of the product using a dose calibrator (see Notes 
24 and 25). 
11. Analyze the product by RP-HPLC to determine the radio-
chemical purity (RCP) (Fig. 3). 
12. The total preparation time is 40–50 min.

68 Ga 
Radiolabeling 
The following procedure is suitable for the manual 68 Ga radiolabel-
ing of any afﬁbody-conjugates containing DOTA- or NOTA-based 
chelators. 
1. Slowly load the 68 Ga solution from the elution of a 68 Ge/68 Ga 
generator (generally in a hydrochloric acid solution of various 
dilutions) onto the freshly conditioned strong cation exchange 
cartridge (see Note 26). Flush the column with air. Measure the 
activity of the eluate in a dose calibrator. Discard the eluate 
after conﬁrming that the activity has been retained in the 
column (see Notes 27 and 28).

Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
2. Elute the 68 Ga with the 5 M NaCl and 5.5 M HCl solution (see 
Note 29) with a ﬂow rate of 1 drop/second. Measure the 
activity of the eluate in a dose calibrator. 
3. Add 0.42 mL 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6 to the 
solution containing 68 Ga; mix and check the pH to be 4 on a 
pH strip (see Note 30). If the pH is lower than 4, adjust it 
adding a suitable extra volume of 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, 
pH 6. Measure the activity of the ﬁnal solution in a dose 
calibrator. 
4. To 5–10 nmol of the afﬁbody conjugate (solid or in solution), 
add approximately 400 MBq of the buffered 68 Ga solution and 
heat the reaction mixture at 80 °C for 15 min (see Notes 31 and 
19). 
5. After storing the solution at room temperature for few minutes 
to cool down, add 0.1 M EDTA solution to the radiolabeling 
mixture to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM (see Note 32). 
Incubate at room temperature for 10–15 min. 
6. Take a small sample to be analyzed by RP-HPLC and ITLC to 
determine the 68 Ga incorporation. Perform ITLC by loading 
1–3 μL sample on an ITLC-SG strip. Run the strip and, once 
dry, analyze it using either a phosphorimager or a radio-TLC 
scanner. Alternately, the strip can be cut in half and the two 
parts measured in a gamma counter. Use either 50 mM EDTA 
pH 4.5 or 0.1 M ammonium acetate with 25 mM EDTA 
pH 5.5 or 20 mM sodium citrate pH 5 as mobile phase: the 
radioconjugate remains at the loading site (retention factor 
Rf = 0) and nonafﬁbody-associated 68 Ga (present in solution 
as either 68 Ga-EDTA or 68 Ga-citrate/acetate) runs with the 
solvent front (Rf = 0.8–1.0). 
7. To purify the radioconjugate, apply the reaction mixture to a 
freshly conditioned spin desalting column and elute the radi-
olabeled product with PBS following the manufacturer instruc-
tions (see Note 33). Alternatively, load the mixture onto the 
previously prepared HLB-SPE cartridge. Discard the elu-
ate. Wash the cartridge with 3 mL aqueous 0.1% TFA, followed 
by 3 mL water. Discard the washings (they should contain just 
free 68 Ga) after measuring the activity in a dose calibrator. Elute 
the product with 130–150 μL of a mixture of ethanol and water 
(see Note 23), and collect it in a 1.5 mL low-protein 
binding vial. 
8. To verify the RCP of the product, take a sample and analyze it 
by RP-HPLC and ITLC as previously described. 
9. Determine the protein concentration by UV-VIS spectroscopy 
(see Note 6), and measure the radioactivity using a dose cali-
brator (see Notes 24 and 34). 
10. The total preparation time is approximately 40 min.

89 Zr 
Radiolabeling 
The following procedure is an adaptation of the general procedure 
developed for the 89 Zr radiolabeling of monoclonal antibodies 
[25, 
26] 
and 
is 
suitable 
for 
the 
radiolabeling 
of 
any 
DFO-containing afﬁbody-conjugates (see Note 35). 
1. Pipette a volume/activity of 89 Zr-oxalate solution in a 1.5 mL 
microcentrifuge tube, based on the experiment design (e.g., 
3–10 MBq if used for in vitro studies, 20–50 MBq for in vivo 
studies). Conﬁrm the activity of the solution using a dose 
calibrator. 
2. Add freshly prepared 2 M Na2CO3 to increase the pH of the 
89 Zr solution to 5–6 (see Note 36). Expect some bubbling due 
to the production of CO2. Shake vigorously for few seconds 
and then centrifuge the solution. Incubate the solution for 
3 min at room temperature. 
3. Add a suitable volume of 0.5 M HEPES pH 7–7.4 (see Note 
37). Shake vigorously for few seconds and then centrifuge the 
solution. 
4. Take a 0.5–1 μL aliquot of the solution and check the pH on a 
pH strip. The pH of the solution should be in the 6.8–7.2 
range for an efﬁcient radiolabeling. If the pH is too low, add a 
small volume of 2 M Na2CO3 (1–3 μL) to adjust it to the 
desired value. Measure the activity of the solution in a dose 
calibrator. 
5. Add an amount of DFO-afﬁbody conjugate in 0.5 M HEPES 
pH 7 according to the experiment design (e.g., 2.5–3.0 μg/ 
MBq). Mix vigorously for a few seconds and then centrifuge 
the solution. 
6. Incubate the reaction mixture for 1 h at room temperature with 
gentle shaking. 
7. Determine the 89 Zr incorporation by ITLC analysis. Load 
a 0.5–1 μL sample on an ITLC-SG strip and use 0.1 M sodium 
citrate pH 5 as mobile phase (see Note 38). 
8. Add 0.1 M EDTA solution to the radiolabelling mixture to a 
ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM (see Note 32). Incubate at room 
temperature for 10–15 min. 
9. Purify the radioconjugate by applying the reaction mixture to a 
freshly conditioned spin-desalting column (see Note 33), and 
elute the radiolabeled product either in PBS or 25 mM sodium 
acetate pH 7 following the manufacturer instructions. 
10. Verify the RCP of the product by ITLC using ITLC-SG strips 
and 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5 as mobile phase. Load 0.5–1 μL 
sample on an ITLC-SG strip. Run the strip, and once dry, 
analyze it using either a phosphorimager or a radio-TLC scan-
ner. Alternately, the strip can be cut in half and the two parts 
measured in a gamma counter. Using 0.1 M sodium citrate

172
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
pH 5 as mobile phase, the radioconjugate remain at the loading 
site (Rf = 0) and non-afﬁbody-associated 89 Zr (present as 89 Zr-
citrate 
or 
89 Zr-EDTA) 
runs 
with 
the 
solvent 
front 
(Rf = 0.8–1.0). 
11. Determine the protein concentration by UV-VIS spectroscopy 
(see Note 6), and measure the radioactivity using a dose cali-
brator (see Notes 24 and 39). 
12. The total preparation time is approximately 2 h.

Notes 
1. Prepare an afﬁbody molecule solution that is neither too 
diluted (<1 mg/mL) nor too concentrated (>1.5 mg/mL) 
to optimize the conjugation yield and avoid the reformation of 
disulﬁde bonds. The tendency of thiol groups to reform dis-
ulﬁdes after reduction is dependent on the concentration of the 
generated free SH groups and the elapsed time after the reduc-
tion. Therefore, perform the conjugation reaction using the 
reduced sample immediately and keep TCEP in the reaction 
mixture. A relatively diluted afﬁbody solution (1.2–1.5 mg/ 
mL) and a molar excess of the reactive bifunctional chelator will 
favor the conjugation reaction over the formation of disulﬁde 
bonds. 
2. The TCEP-mediated reduction can be performed in most 
buffers (not exclusively PBS), as well as in ultrapure water. 
Select the solvent based on the afﬁbody molecule’s solubility 
in these solutions. 
3. Some reduction procedures in the literature suggest purging 
the solution from oxygen using a stream of nitrogen gas to 
minimize the oxidation of thiol group and the formation of 
disulﬁde bonds. From our experience, this step is not crucial for 
the success of the reaction. 
4. A reducing agent is necessary when using a cysteine-bearing 
afﬁbody molecule supplied as a stock solution. In that case, 
following the formation of a disulﬁde bond, the solution most 
likely contains the afﬁbody molecule as a stable and inert dimer. 
If the cysteine-bearing afﬁbody molecule is supplied as a pow-
der, the addition of a reducing agent in the conjugation mix-
ture might be unnecessary. A conﬁrmation, for instance by 
PAGE or HPLC analysis, of the molecular form of the afﬁbody 
molecule (i.e., monomer or dimer) would be recommended 
before planning a conjugation reaction. 
5. Prepare the bifunctional chelators stock solutions immediately 
before use and discard them after use. The maleimide ring is 
susceptible to hydrolysis, especially in mildly alkaline aqueous

solutions, therefore old solutions will yield either low or no 
conjugation. 
6. The determination of the concentration of the afﬁbody conju-
gate by UV spectroscopy can be performed in two ways: 
(1) When the molar extinction (ε280) is known, measure the 
absorbance of the protein solution at 280 nm and calculate the 
concentration (in M) using the Beer-Lambert law; (2) When a 
correction coefﬁcient is available (indicating the absorbance at 
280 nm of a mg/mL solution of the afﬁbody molecule and 
usually given by the afﬁbody molecule supplier), measure the 
mg/mL concentration at 280 nm and multiply it by the coefﬁ-
cient. Of note, usually the conjugated chelator has no absor-
bance at 280 nm, therefore the product concentration is 
calculated from the afﬁbody molecule absorbance only. In 
case the chelator is UV active at 280 nm, its contribution to 
the absorbance should be considered when calculating the 
product concentration. 
7. The use of metal-free solutions is advisable (in both conjuga-
tion and radiolabelling reactions) since metal ions can poten-
tially compete with the radiometals for the same chelator. 
Generally, radiometals are present in a very low concentration; 
therefore, the presence of competing metal ions can seriously 
compromise the radiolabeling yield. Prepare metal-free buffers 
by treating them with metal-chelating resins, such as Chelex 
100. These kinds of resins contain chelating groups that are 
able to bind polyvalent metal ions (especially heavy metal ions). 
Among the available resins, Chelex is the most widely used. It is 
a weakly acidic cation exchange resin, but different from ordi-
nary exchangers; it is characterized by a high selectivity for 
metal ions and forms high strength bonds at basic, neutral, 
and weakly acidic pH (pH ≥4). 
8. Size exclusion chromatography (or gel ﬁltration) is very often 
used in protein puriﬁcation processes. This technique involves 
the separation of molecules based on their different dimen-
sions, molecular weight, shape or size (i.e., hydrodynamic 
radius) using columns ﬁlled with resins with varied pore sizes. 
Gel-ﬁltration pre-packed columns are routinely used to sepa-
rate and remove unwanted small molecules from a macromole-
cule of interest (i.e., desalting), or exchange the buffer. A wide 
range of such columns are commercially available and they 
differ based on the sample processing (i.e., gravity-ﬂow or 
centrifuge-columns), resin’s pore size (i.e., molecular weight 
cut off), and sample volumes. Spin columns (e.g., Vivaspin 
protein concentrators, Zeba spin desalting columns) offer a 
quicker puriﬁcation process and a smaller sample elution vol-
ume compared to gravity driven columns (e.g., PD-10,

174
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
NAP-10, and CentriPure P10). Importantly, before use, select 
the most suitable format for the application. 
9. The reducing agent can be removed from the afﬁbody mole-
cule solution using desalting columns before proceeding with 
the conjugation reaction, which is then followed by another 
puriﬁcation step to achieve the ﬁnal product. This multi-steps 
conjugation procedure might result in a poor protein recov-
ery mostly due to the closeness of the molecular weight cut off 
(MWCO) of the membrane of the commercially available size 
exclusion columns (usually 5–7 kDa MWCO) to the molecular 
weight of the afﬁbody conjugate (approximately 7 kDa). Addi-
tionally, such two-step conjugation process can be time-
consuming and requires the use of multiple puriﬁcation steps. 
A one-pot conjugation reaction using TCEP-HCl as the reduc-
ing agent, which is not removed from the mixture, can improve 
the product yield and simplify its puriﬁcation [8]. 
10. Manufacturer protocols suggest to add a metal chelating agent 
such as EDTA (ﬁnal concentration of 5–20 mM) to the sample 
solution to remove free metals that could promote the oxida-
tion of the generated free sulfhydryl groups. This is a precau-
tionary measure that should be added to the use of plastic 
tools, such as vials and spatulas, to keep the quantity of free 
metals ions in solution as low as possible. 
11. For most applications, concentrations of TCEP in the 
5–50 mM range, in the reaction mixture, provide sufﬁcient 
molar excess to effectively reduce disulphide bonds in peptides 
or proteins. Differently from other reducing agents (e.g., 
DTT), TCEP does not contain thiols, and there should be no 
need to remove it from solution before adding the maleimide-
functionalised chelator. The manufacturer reports that TCEP 
concentrations <10–20 mM are compatible with maleimide 
reaction chemistry. However, TCEP interacts with maleimide 
to some degree and can affect the conjugation reaction yield. 
To compensate for that, add a molar excess of maleimide 
functionalized chelator to achieve a high yielding conjugation. 
The extra amount of TCEP and chelator can be easily removed 
during the RP-HPLC puriﬁcation of the conjugate. 
12. Efﬁcient disulﬁde reduction occurs over a wide range of pH 
(pH 4.0–9.0) and temperature (0–95 °C) with highest tem-
peratures promoting the reaction. Due to the presence of the 
highly acidic TCEP-HCl and the low buffering capacity of 
PBS, the pH of the conjugation solution is usually around 
5 and does not need to be adjusted to help the conjugation. 
However, if necessary, higher pH values can be achieved using 
1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5–7.0 instead of PBS.

13. The protein type and its concentration determine the incuba-
tion time. Generally, >1 mg/mL protein solutions with 
require minimum 1 h reaction time. If needed, monitor the 
reaction kinetics by HPLC. 
14. The procedure described herein is suitable for the manual 
preparation of 18 F-AlF-labeled afﬁbody conjugates. Although 
not applied to the preparation of afﬁbody-based radioconju-
gates yet, some methodologies for the automated production 
of 18 F-AlF-labeled peptides has been reported by Allott et al. 
[27] and Tshibangu et al. [28]. 
15. A stable chelation of the 18 F-AlF2+ core can be achieved using 
derivatives of macrocyclic chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane 
(TACN). Owing to its commercially availability, also in its 
bifunctional 
form, 
1,4,7-triazacyclononane-triacetic 
acid 
(NOTA) is the most frequently used chelator for the develop-
ment of 18 F-AlF agents, especially in its pentadentate form. 
However, chelators containing the 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-
1,4-diacetate (NODA) motif showed high radiolabeling yields 
due to the presence of just two carboxylic groups adjacent to 
the nitrogen atoms in the ring instead of three (Fig. 4). The 
third carbonyl group in the NOTA molecule, although not 
being directly involved in the coordination of the aluminum 
center, could affect the formation of a stable complex due to its 
electron-withdrawing ability [8, 29, 30]. The mentioned pen-
tadentate chelators form octahedral complexes with the alumi-
num ion, leaving a single coordination site for strongly binding 
ﬂuoride (Fig. 4). 
16. Add an amount of acetate buffer to a ﬁnal concentration of 
25–35 mM (considering the aqueous solution volume only), 
which is the lowest concentration capable to maintain the 
optimal pH of 4. Based on our experience, higher acetate 
quantities lead to low 18 F incorporation. The reason has not 
been investigated yet. However, it is known that acetate buffers 
can form coordination complexes with metals ions. Such effect

176
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
can be beneﬁcial for an efﬁcient chelation of radiometals. In 
particular, for radiometal ions such as 111 In3+ and 68 Ga3+ , it has 
been suggested that a weak prechelation effect by the acetate 
ions is necessary for the efﬁcient labeling of conjugates since it 
would prevent the formation of insoluble 111 In/68 Ga-hydro-
xides. On the other hand, coordinating buffers can have the 
same effect on metal contaminants that are present in the 
radiolabeling mixture and that will then compete with the 
radiometal, hindering the formation of the radiolabeled prod-
uct [31]. The same might happen with the 18 F-AlF complex, 
but no studies on the subject have been performed yet. 
17. Perform the reaction at pH 4–4.5 to achieve the highest yield-
ing 18 F radiolabeling [29]. The pH is very critical for the 
formation of the 
18 F-AlF complex: at too low pH, the 
18-ﬂuoride ion would be available in very low quantities since 
it would be mostly protonated (i.e. H18 F). At too high pH 
(4 > pH > 6), the aluminum ion would be forming the 
insoluble, and, therefore, unreactive, hydroxide form Al 
(OH)3 [32]. The optimal pH for the radiolabeling reaction 
is, therefore, around 4, in which both the Al3+ cation and the 
18 F- anion are the dominant species in solution. 
18. The addition of an organic cosolvent is recommended to 
increase the radiolabel incorporation [33]. Choose the type 
of organic solvent to use depending on the protein solubility 
in that solvent and the use of the product (e.g., higher % 
of ethanol can be tolerated in radiopharmaceuticals formula-
tions for the clinical use than other organic solvents. Addition-
ally, differently from other organic solvents, ethanol is a known 
radioprotector). 
19. The presence of multiple radioactive products in the HPLC 
trace could indicate that the radioconjugate is affected by 
radiolysis. In that case, the addition of a radioprotector, such 
as ascorbic acid, is highly recommended. 
20. The HPLC puriﬁcation step is not always required. It has been 
observed that low molecular weight byproducts can be formed 
during the radiolabeling reaction due to the high reaction 
temperature. This is observed mostly when the chelator is 
conjugated to the afﬁbody molecule via a maleimide-thiol 
bond. In those cases, an HPLC puriﬁcation can efﬁciently 
eliminate the side products from the ﬁnal radioconjugate. 
However, not all afﬁbody conjugates show such thermal insta-
bility, and therefore, in those cases, the HPLC puriﬁcation step 
can be skipped and the ﬁnal radioconjugates can be isolated by 
performing just a straightforward SPE (e.g., with HLB car-
tridges) or gel ﬁltration puriﬁcation. 
21. Differently from 18 F-labeled small molecules, radiolabeled afﬁ-
body conjugates show the same retention time of their

Radiolabeled Afﬁbody Molecules for PET Imaging
177
precursors on the HPLC trace independently from the gradi-
ent, mobile phase system, and type of column used. For that 
reason, the two molecules co-elute when puriﬁed by liquid 
chromatography (e.g., HPLC, SPE) and a no-carrier-added 
afﬁbody-based radioactive product has so far not been 
achieved. 
22. If loaded slowly (e.g., 1 drop/s), this solution from the 
HLB-SPE cartridge contains only free 18 F-ﬂuoride. If some 
radiolabeled afﬁbody conjugate goes through, decrease the 
loading speed. 
23. The ethanol-to-water ratio in the eluent depends on the hydro-
philicity/lipophilicity of the afﬁbody conjugate. Generally an 
aqueous solution containing 50–70% of ethanol (v/v) is able to 
elute the majority of afﬁbody radioconjugates from an 
HLB-SPE cartridge. 
24. Use these data to determine the RCY (after decay correction), 
the protein recovery, and the apparent speciﬁc/molar activity 
of the product. 
25. When using a nonpuriﬁed 
18 F-ﬂuoride solution, apparent 
molar activities up to 11 MBq/nmol (at the end of synthesis) 
and RCYs of 30–40% can be achieved. 
26. In the clinic, 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals are prepared by adding 
the generator eluate directly into the kit containing the mole-
cule to radiolabel. However, for research purposes, it is advis-
able to process the generator eluate before use for the 
following important reasons: First, the eluate from the com-
mercial generator contains long-lived 68 Ge (i.e., germanium 
breakthrough) in variable amounts depending on the age and 
the make of the generator; In addition, metallic impurities such 
as Zn(II), Fe(III), and residuals from the generator column 
material are present in the eluate. Because these trace metal 
impurities can compete with 68 Ga for the chelator, labeling 
yields and speciﬁc activities can be affected. Furthermore, the 
large volume and the hydrochloric acid content of the genera-
tor eluate can limit its direct use in radiolabeling reactions. 
Large reaction volumes enhance the risk of insufﬁcient 68 Ga-
labeling yields and speciﬁc activities, especially in preclinical 
settings, when low amounts of precursors are used. Several 
approaches for processing generator-derived 
68 Ga can be 
found in the literature, including fractionation (i.e., the use 
of just the 1–2 mL of the eluate, which contains the highest 
68 Ga activity) [34], anion-exchange chromatography, and 
cation-exchange chromatography [35]. All methods aim to 
obtain more concentrated and metal-free 68 Ga solutions and 
consequent efﬁcient and reproducible 68 Ga-labelling results. 
After testing and conﬁrming the efﬁcacy of the different

178
Chiara Da Pieve and Gabriela Kramer-Marek
methods, the choice of describing herein the cation-exchange 
approach is based on personal experience and preference. 
27. Sample application with a ﬂow rate of 1 drop/second showed 
efﬁcient trapping of the radioactivity onto the column. Faster 
loading speeds might result in insufﬁcient retention of the 
activity by the sorbent of the SPE column. 
28. The handling of PET nuclides may result in signiﬁcant radia-
tion doses to the hands of workers, particularly the ﬁngers. The 
contribution of positrons to the skin dose is dominant, espe-
cially in the case of high-energy positron emitters, such as 68 Ga. 
Therefore, avoid the direct contact of the ﬁngers with 
unshielded vials, syringes, tubing, or valves containing such 
radionuclides. If possible, connect the 68 Ge/68 Ga generator 
to the SPE cartridge and load the generator eluate directly 
onto the column. Alternatively, transfer the generator eluate 
onto the cartridge using a syringe drive. Additionally, always 
use long forceps or tweezers during the whole preparation of 
the radioconjugate. 
29. Use a cartridge with a quantity of sorbent suitable for the 
retention of all 68 Ga activity. A cartridge with a low amount 
of sorbent (i.e., smaller bed weight) (30–100 mg) allows for a 
small elution volume (ca 150–350 μL), which results in a 
higher protein concentration in the radiolabeling reaction mix-
ture and consequently in favorable radiometal incorporation 
(and ﬁnal RCY). Additionally, by using high concentration 
buffers (i.e., great buffer capacity; 0.5–1.5 M, pH 6) the 
desired pH value can be secured by the addition of small 
volumes, thus keeping the protein concentration in the reac-
tion mixture as high as possible. 
30. During 68 Ga radiolabeling, the control of the pH is very 
important. Gallium (III) ions are present as the main form of 
gallium in solution when the pH is lower than 4. At higher pH 
(4–8), the main product is the insoluble Ga(OH)3, also called 
Ga-colloid, since it precipitates from solution. Once precipi-
tated, this form of gallium is not reactive and the radiolabeling 
reaction is compromised. The buffering capacity of acetate is 
very good in the pH 4–5 range, and therefore, the acetate 
buffer can maintain the desired pH during the reaction pre-
venting the formation of Ga-colloid and allowing an efﬁcient 
radiolabeling. 
31. The temperature can be increased up to 95 °C to improve the 
radiolabel incorporation. Differently from DOTA, the radiola-
beling of NOTA-afﬁbody conjugates with 
68 Ga could be

Radiolabeled Afﬁbody Molecules for PET Imaging
179
performed either at 80–95 °C or at lower temperature (e.g., 
40 °C or even room temperature) [36]. 
32. Use EDTA to chelate the nonincorporated radiometal ions. 
Being the radiometal-EDTA complex stable at a large range of 
pH values, this step avoid the possibility of formation and 
precipitation of insoluble 68 Ga-colloid during the puriﬁcation 
step and QC analysis. 
33. Salt and small molecules removal using size exclusion/desalt-
ing columns is typically 95–100%. However, the recovery of 
the ﬁnal product generally depends on the protein concentra-
tion and the sample volume loaded onto the column. Some 
protein loss occurs at the lowest sample volumes and protein 
concentrations (<0.2 mg/mL). Of note, the removal of impu-
rities and protein recovery depend also on the individual char-
acteristics of the biomolecules (e.g., molecular weight, shape, 
hydrophobicity, solubility, binding sites). Based on our experi-
ence, expect protein recovery of approximately 40% when 
using resins with an exclusion limit (MWCO) very similar to 
the size of the biomolecule of interest. 
34. Apparent molar activity of the radiolabeled conjugate in the 
range of 2.8–5.2 MBq/nmol at the end of synthesis are 
expected. 
35. Due to their small size, afﬁbody molecules are characterized by 
a rapid pharmacokinetics and fast tumor uptake (i.e., within 
30 min post injection), which are perfectly compatible with 
short-lived radionuclides (i.e., 18 F, 68 Ga). However, at times, 
PET imaging using biomolecules with fast pharmacokinetics 
shows an improved contrast at time points beyond 3–4 h p.i. In 
that event, long-lived radiometals (such as 89 Zr, half-life of 
3.27 days) should be employed. 
36. Freshly produced 89 Zr-oxalate solutions might require smaller 
volumes of 2 M Na2CO3 compared to older solutions. Possibly 
because oxalate concentration in older 89 Zr solution is higher 
as the result of the slow evaporation of the water during either 
its storage at room temperature or its transfer from the supplier 
to the customer. Sometimes, the presence of a precipitate (i.e., 
oxalic acid) has been observed. This precipitate can be 
removed, but as it can include some 89 Zr, the activity of the 
leftover solution will decrease. Alternatively, the precipitate can 
be dissolved by adding water or buffer to the 89 Zr-oxalate 
stock solution. In this case, the smallest possible volume of 
water or buffer should be added to keep the oxalic acid con-
centration above 13 μM and avoid the formation of insoluble 
and unreactive Zr(IV) hydroxide species [37]. 
37. To achieve and sustain an adequate pH, alternative buffers to 
HEPES can be used (e.g., phosphate, ammonium acetate).

180

Alternatively, the pH of 89 Zr-oxalate solution can be adjusted 
to 7 using just Na2CO3 solution (pH >9). The amount of the 
carbonate solution should be rigorously determined and the 
pH of the solution carefully monitored. Importantly, the radi-
olabeling protocol (e.g., quantity of buffer and reaction time) 
should be prepared based on the reaction conditions (e.g., type 
of buffer and freshness of 89 Zr-oxalate solution). Based on our 
experience, a reproducible neutralization of a 3-day-old 89 Zr-
oxalate solution is achieved using a combination of Na2CO3 
and HEPES. A 2 M Na2CO3 to 89 Zr-oxalate ratio of 1:2.2 
(v/v) is required to increase the pH of the 89 Zr-oxalate solu-
tion to 4.5–5. A 0.5 M HEPES, pH 7 to 89 Zr-oxalate ratio of 
2.5:1 (v/v) is then required to adequately adjust the pH to 7. 
38. Although 89 Zr incorporations of >95% can be achieved follow-
ing the radiolabelling procedure and a product with such high 
RCP could be used without further processing, the reaction 
mixture contains oxalic acid that is highly toxic and should be 
removed before performing in vivo studies. A puriﬁcation step 
is therefore highly recommended. 
39. When using a 3-day-old 89 Zr-oxalate solution, apparent molar 
activity in the 11–21 MBq/nmol range (at the end of synthe-
sis) and 89 Zr incorporation of 80–98% can be achieved.

Abstract 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive molecular imaging technique that uses radioac-
tive tracers to map molecular and metabolic processes in living animals. PET can be performed as a stand-
alone modality but is often combined with CT to provide for objective anatomical localization of PET 
signals in a multimodality approach. In order to outline the general approach to evaluating four mice 
simultaneously by dynamic PET imaging, the use of the aldehyde-targeted radiotracer [18 F]NA3BF3 in 
mouse models of hepatotoxicity will be described. Indeed the production of aldehydes is upregulated in a 
wide range of disease and injury, making them a suitable biomarker for PET imaging of numerous 
pathologies. 
Key words Positron emission tomography, Aldehydes, In-vivo imaging, PET-CT, hepatotoxicity

Introduction 
PET is an important preclinical molecular imaging technique that 
uses 
radionuclide-labelled 
molecules 
to 
noninvasively 
map 
biological processes of interest with high sensitivity and in three 
dimensions. While PET imaging is an important clinical tool, it is 
also a powerful preclinical technique that not only leads to the 
development of clinical tracers but is also used for longitudinal 
studies in animal models to better understand certain biological 
processes. While PET provides high sensitivity information about 
the localization of radiotracers, it does not provide anatomical 
information about the subject under study. As a result, PET is 
often combined with computed tomography (CT), an X-ray-
based imaging technique that can generate high-resolution images 
of subject anatomy. This multimodality approach is invaluable for 
the objective quantitation of radiotracer uptake in tissues and 
pathologies with a high degree of spatial certainty and accuracy. 
In vivo aldehydes are produced and maintained by tightly 
regulated mechanisms [1]. Disruption of these mechanisms often 
results in an increase of aldehyde production, creating a tissue

environment with high aldehydic load [2]. This increase in aldehy-
dic load often underlies the early stages of many pathologies, 
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and acutely following 
injury [3–6]. These aldehydes are highly reactive and quickly form 
adducts with DNA and proteins, which may contribute to the 
propagation of injury and disease. The diversity of aldehydes with 
pathogenic potential supports the need for in vivo imaging of 
aldehydes.
186
Alexia Kirby and Adam J. Shuhendler
A radiotracer designed to measure aldehydic load is unlike the 
most common radiotracer, 2-deoxy-2-[18 F]ﬂuoro D-glucose (FDG), 
in that it does not act as a metabolic surrogate. FDG is taken up by 
glucose transporters, phosphorylated, and, subsequently, trapped 
intracellularly and, thereby, maps aerobic metabolism. Imaging 
in vivo aldehydes, however, is more efﬁcient through a substrate-
binding mechanism rather than a surrogate mechanism. For a PET 
radiotracer to work effectively to map aldehydes, the reaction must 
occur rapidly, without a catalyst, under physiological conditions, and 
stick to the location where the substrate was bound. 
Two radiotracers have been developed for this technique: 
68 Ga-NODAGA-Indole [7] and 18 F-NA3BF3 [8]. The former is 
an allysine-reactive probe that binds to converted lysine residues of 
oxidized collagen in ﬁbrotic lung tissue. 18 F-NA3BF3 is an anthra-
nilic acid-based probe that reacts with both intra- and extracellular 
aldehydes to form hydrazones. This tracer represents a ﬁrst-
generation aldehyde PET tracer that can be used to map whole-
body in vivo aldehydic load. 
Here, aldehyde PET imaging with 18 F-NA3BF3 is described in 
a mouse model of acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxic-
ity. The model involves a single, same-day injection of acetamino-
phen, which induces lipid peroxidation and aldehyde production, 
especially in the liver, and has been shown to cause an increase in 
aldehydic load. The goal of the method is to quantitatively map the 
in vivo aldehydic load in mice over time and across acetaminophen 
doses using [18 F]-NA3BF3-PET.

3.2 
Animal 
Preparation 
1. Create a sterile environment by wiping area with disinfecting 
spray and placing absorbent padding on bench. Lay out all 
materials needed to prepare the animals for cannulation. 
2. Prepare one tail vain cannula per mouse (Fig. 1). Cut a length 
of polyethylene tubing long enough to allow access when 
animals are centered in PET scanner (approx. 10–15 cm for 
most scanners). Remove a 27G or 30G needle from its hub by 
breaking the plastic with needle forceps, and secure the blunt 
end into one end of the tubing. Draw 500 μL saline with a 
needle attached to a 1 mL syringe, and secure onto the other 
end of the tube. Push the syringe until the saline exits from the 
needle end of the cannula, and take note of the volume pushed 
through. Ensure there are no air bubbles anywhere in the line. 
3. Place mouse in induction box on heating pad with 3% isoﬂur-
ane at 1.5–2 L/min 
4. When mouse is anesthetized (unresponsive to touch), remove 
from box and place head in nose cone on prep table on 
heating pad. 
5. Apply eye gel to the eyes. 
6. Place mouse on its side to expose lateral tail vein, located on the 
left- and right-most aspects of the tail when the mouse is on its 
side. The vein will be more difﬁcult to see in strains with darker 
pigmented tails (e.g., C57bl/6, Fig. 1a) 
7. Warm tail with heat lamp, taking care not to burn the tail (see 
Note 3) 
8. Wipe the tail with an alcohol swab. 
9. Cannula insertion should be attempted toward the distal end of 
the tail, with following attempts moving more proximal. In the 
nondominant hand, either hold the tail between the thumb 
and index ﬁnger or weave the tail under the foreﬁnger, under 
the third and fourth, and over the ﬁfth ﬁnger (Fig. 1a). Bend 
the tail slightly to expose an area for cannulation (Fig. 1b). 
Insert the needle of the cannula into the lateral tail vein at a ~5° 
angle to the tail, ensuring at least half (>6.5 mm) of the needle 
is in the vein (Fig. 1c). 
10. Verify the cannula is in the vein by pushing on the syringe. The 
vein will visibly ﬂush with saline, and the plunger will have no 
resistance. If the needle is not in place, the syringe will be 
difﬁcult 
to 
push 
and 
the 
tail 
will 
blanche 
at 
needle 
insertion site. 
11. Add one drop of skin adhesive where the needle meets the tail 
and allow to dry for 30 s. 
12. Secure the cannula with paper tape (Fig. 1d). 
13. Turn on isoﬂurane to PET/CT bed to 2%.

The lateral tail vein is located and dilated with a heat lamp in a C56Bl/6 mouse (left) and nu/nu mouse (right). 
(b) Needle insertion into vein occurs at a ~5° angle to the tail. (c) Successful placement of the needle of the 
cannula is shown in both mice. (d) The animals are moved to the PET bed and tape is placed to secure the 
bodies of the mice, the tails, and the cannulas 
14. Move the mouse over to the PET/CT bed, with the mouse in 
one hand and syringe in the other to avoid displacing the 
cannula. Place the mouse in a prone position. 
15. Secure the body of the mouse, tail, and cannula with tape, and 
ensure the cannula is in place by pushing the plunger of the 
syringe (Fig. 1d). This will ensure proper injection of the 
radiotracer. 
Insert 
rectal 
temperature 
probe 
and 
secure 
with tape. 
16. Verify that temperature and respiration monitors are working 
and within range. Respiration rate should be maintained at 
60–100 breaths per minute, which can be adjusted by increas-
ing or decreasing isoﬂurane. Body temperature should be 
maintained at 35–37 °C.

190

17. Note the position of each mouse in the imaging bed, and 
ensure the bed is aligned with the imaging ﬁeld of view 
(FOV) of the scanner. The speciﬁc method for FOV centering 
will change depending on the vendor. Ensure both PET and 
CT FOVs are adequate for region of interest of imaging (i.e., 
whole mouse, head only, abdomen only). 
3.3 
Radiotracer 
Preparation 
1. Synthesize radiotracer as previously described. Due to the short 
half-life of 18 F, the subsequent steps need to be done quickly. 
2. Radiotracer dose preparation is performed behind a lead shield, 
with one dose prepared for each animal in the immediately 
following scan. It is recommended to double glove when 
handling radioactivity so that contaminated PPE can be quickly 
removed. 
3. Measure the total radioactivity obtained in the dose calibrator. 
Note the time of this measurement to account for decay. 
4. Dilute stock radiotracer to ~200 μCi/100 μL. If more than one 
round of imaging will be done with the same stock, only dilute 
a portion of the stock. 
5. Draw up 150–200 μCi of activity per mouse with 27G insulin 
syringes, ensuring the volume is a maximum of 10 mL/kg per 
mouse. If multiple mice are being scanned, mark each syringe 
with a number corresponding to each mouse ID. Measure each 
syringe in the dose calibrator and note the activity and time for 
each syringe. 
6. When all doses have been prepared, place in a lead carrier and 
bring to PET/CT animal bed or cradle. 
3.4 
Injection and 
Scanning 
1. Attach the radiotracer dose to the tail vein cannula. With a pair 
of forceps, grasp the end of the cannula and remove the syringe 
and needle containing saline and place to the side. Carefully 
insert the needle of the tracer-containing syringe into the can-
nula. Repeat for all mice. 
2. The scan types should be selected and placed in queue. For 
PET/CT, select the PET scan program desired (e.g., static scan 
of a given time frame and dynamic scan with preset imaging 
bins) and the CT program necessary (see Note 4). Importantly, 
for dynamic scans, an initial 15–30 s bin should be included to 
allow delay between scan program initiation and radiotracer 
injection. This is key for accurate kinetic analyses. 
3. On the instrument control station, start the scan and timer 
simultaneously 
4. After the delay set in the ﬁrst bin of a dynamic scan has passed 
(15 or 30 s), inject the radiotracer over a period of 3–5  s.

Multisubject PET/CT Workﬂow
191
5. Replace the empty radiotracer syringes with the saline-ﬁlled 
syringes, and inject enough volume to simultaneously ﬂush all 
of the cannulae (~50–100 μL) with saline. 
6. Measure the residual radioactivity in each radiotracer syringe 
and note the time. 
7. Monitor respiration rate carefully during the scan, and adjust 
isoﬂurane if necessary. 
8. If another PET/CT scan is to be performed afterwards, use this 
time to set up for the next scan. Mice can be cannulated, and 
doses can be drawn toward the end of the ﬁrst scan. 
9. When imaging is complete, remove all tape securing the can-
nula to the bed and the tail. Pinch the injection site the with 
gauze while removing the needle to stop bleeding. Place mouse 
back in cage on heating pad to recover. The mice should be 
held in a designated area behind a lead shield overnight or until 
ready to replace back in housing room, depending on the 
facility. 
3.5 
Image 
Reconstruction 
1. Depending on the vendor, there will be a variety of image 
reconstruction algorithms to choose from. Reconstruction 
algorithm choice will depend on a balance of resolution, time, 
and quantitative accuracy required and should be evaluated in a 
pilot fashion. 
2. Reconstruction will necessarily involve data about photon 
attenuation derived from the CT or an attenuation scan if 
PET-only imaging is performed. 
3.6 
Image Analysis
1. The speciﬁc workﬂow for image analysis will depend on the 
tissue/organ of interest and the disease model utilized, as well 
as the software package chosen for analysis. 
2. For multi-animal scans, each animal should be cropped from 
the image and analyzed separately so that precise injected dose 
can be input into time-activity curves or use for radiotracer 
uptake (either as % injected dose per gram or summed uptake 
value). 
3. Output images should include a standardized scale range and 
scale unit (either as % injected dose per gram or summed uptake 
value) to afford comparison across individuals between treat-
ment groups (Fig. 2).

Notes 
1. Multi-mouse beds are commonly provided by the PET/CT 
instrument manufacturers and are supplied with anesthesia 
and heating with proprietary adaptors. If this is not the case, a

30–45 min after PET scan initiation 
multi-mouse bed can be 3-D printed; however, heating and the 
equal distribution of anesthesia to all positions must be tested 
prior to implementation on live animals. 
2. Use of radioisotopes and radiotracers should comply with insti-
tutional and Federal policies for the safe use of radioactivity. 
3. Keeping one hand next to mouse under heat lamp will ensure 
heating does not result in burn. 
4. CT program for single mouse and multi-mouse will be differ-
ent with different total deposited dose. These programs can be 
found preprogrammed on most scanners and should be eval-
uated prior to use.

5. Unlike in metabolism-based imaging (e.g., FDG), animals do 
not need to be fasted overnight to image aldehydes. 
6. 18 F-NA3BF3 does not cross the blood–brain barrier and, there-
fore, cannot be used for aldehydes imaging in brain tissue. 
7. Animals should always be warmed while under general anaes-
thesia, as they cannot regulate their body temperature. The 
effect of body temperature on 18 F-NA3BF3 distribution is 
unknown, but animals should be kept at 37 °C for animal 
welfare. 
8. F18-labelled radiotracers have a half-life of 109.7 min, which 
makes it possible to perform multiple scans in a day if the 
production yield is good 
9. Always be sure to choose an appropriate mouse model for the 
pathology of interest 
10. Dynamic scans are recommended for novel radiotracers as the 
optimal time with peak uptake will be unknown. A dynamic 
scan will capture the tracer’s entry into the blood stream and 
biodistribution, as well as clearance (hepatic or urinary). 
11. Position the area of interest (e.g., tumor, organ) to the center 
of the PET camera, where sensitivity and resolution are highest.

Preclinical PET/CT Imaging Data

Abstract 
Positron emission tomography (PET) has transformed medical imaging, and while ﬁrst developed and 
applied to the human setting, it has found widespread application at the preclinical level over the past two 
decades. Its strength is that it offers noninvasive 3D tomographic imaging in a quantitative manner at very 
high sensitivity. Paired with the right molecular probes, invaluable insights into physiology and pathophysi-
ology have been accessible and therapeutic development has been enhanced through preclinical PET 
imaging. PET imaging is now often routinely combined with either computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide additional anatomical context. All these developments 
were accompanied by the provision of ever more complex and powerful analysis software enabling users 
to visualize and quantify signals from PET imaging data. Aside from experimental complexities, there are 
also various pitfalls in PET image data analysis, which can negatively impact on reporting and 
reproducibility. 
Here, we provide a protocol intended to guide the inexperienced user through PET/CT data analysis. 
We describe the general principles and workﬂows required for PET/CT image data visualization and 
quantitative analysis using various software packages popular in the ﬁeld. Moreover, we present recom-
mendations for reporting of preclinical PET/CT data including examples of good and poor practice.

Introduction 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is now an established and 
invaluable tool for the quantitative assessment of molecular and 
physiological biomarkers in many different ﬁelds, including oncol-
ogy [1–5], neurology [6–9], cardiology [10–12], and immunology, 
[13–15] as well as preclinically and clinically. Moreover, the princi-
ples of molecular imaging [16] have been applied for noninvasive 
whole-body tracking of cells using PET-compatible approaches

[17], for example, to quantify cancer cell spread in preclinical tumor 
models [18, 19] and the in vivo distribution of stem cells [20–23] 
or to enhance the development of emerging T cell-based therapies 
[24–31].

PET images can be considered as space and time integrals of 
exogenously administered radioactive probe distribution in each 
timeframe, commonly with units of kBq/cm3 tissue (radioactiv-
ity/volume). Such “dynamic” scans provide time-activity concen-
tration curves (TAC) for each individual voxel in a 3D image. The 
gold standard for PET quantitation is compartmental tracer kinetic 
modelling. The standard uptake value (SUV, also known as differ-
ential uptake ratio) is a frequently used measure indicating high or 
low tissue uptake of a PET probe, reﬂecting the concentration of 
radioactivity corrected for both the administered dose as well as 
(commonly) the weight of the subject, although other metrics 
(body surface area, lean body mass) can be used. Although there 
are no agreed guidelines for preclinical studies, SUV and %ID/g or 
%ID/mL are the most common metrics reported. As SUV relies on 
several assumptions that may not be met [32], as well as standar-
dized conditions, the use of tissue ratios (SUVR) can help control 
for such variation [33]. 
PET technology requires signal acquisition, image reconstruc-
tion, and further processing steps including frequent overlay with 
images from other modalities (e.g., computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to visualize and interpret the 
obtained data reliably (for physics and technical aspects we refer to 
[7, 8]). The standardization of these processes is key to ensure that 
the obtained data and interpretations thereof are reproducible, 
reliable, valid, and comparable between studies and institutions. 
While much progress has been made in clinical PET, which is 
often performed now in multi-center studies, preclinical standardi-
zation lags behind, with animal studies usually performed only by 
single sites and not validated across facilities. The apparent lack of 
standardization in preclinical PET imaging affects study designs 
(e.g., amount and speciﬁc molar radioactivity of administered 
molecular probe, type of anesthetic agent, and depth of animal 
anesthesia, etc.), image acquisition (e.g., scanner performance, 
including limits of detection, resolution, noise equivalent count 
rate (NECR), and calibration thereof), image reconstruction, 
image processing (e.g., use of different software packages), and 
image visualization. Notably, there is currently no uniform way 
for reporting any of the latter in scientiﬁc publications. Several 
initiatives have been formed to tackle these issues in preclinical 
PET research, including the European Society of Molecular Imag-
ing Standardization of Small Animal Imaging Working Group and 
the Euro-BioImaging Medical Node Data Management Working 
Group, with a small consortia also publishing in this area [34, 35].

In this protocol, we provide guidance on how to use the

Materials 
There are several software packages available to visualize PET/CT 
images. They include the commercial suites VivoQuant, PMOD, 
MIM, and OsiriX, as well as free software such as AMIDE, 3D 
Slicer, or the Beth Israel PET/CT Viewer (a FIJI/ImageJ plugin). 
Here, we focus on three of the most frequently used software 
packages in preclinical research, VivoQuant, PMOD, and AMIDE 
(Fig. 1). General principles and workﬂows are emphasized over 
detailed speciﬁcs, which may change as software is updated. 
Fig. 1 Usage data for commercial and free image processing and analysis software. Data are derived from the 
PMC database (Bars/grey). Using the search terms “[software] AND [imaging] AND [PET],” the number of 
publications was extracted from the whole PMC database, publications of the last 5 years, and publications of 
the last year (search performed on 13 Feb 2021). The share that each software package had in each category 
as a percentage of the total sum of papers published using these software packages is shown. Arrows indicate 
if the share of a software package increased, fell, or stayed roughly constant over the years (Open circles/ 
blue). Using the search terms “[software] AND [imaging] AND [PET],” the number of publications was 
extracted and compared to the number of publications found with the more generic search terms “[software] 
AND [imaging],” which included all other imaging modalities. The percentage of publications using the shown 
software is displayed, indicating which software packages were particularly used by the PET, PET/CT, and 
PET/MRI imaging communities

VivoQuant
VivoQuant is a commercial postprocessing suite for preclinical 
images, and its latest release is VivoQuant 2020 (http://www. 
VivoQuant.com/). It consists of base software with viewing func-
tionality and region of interest analyses, as well as various additional 
compatible modules, including, for example, a rodent organ atlas. 
Here, the VivoQuant 2020 version has been used. 
2.2 
PMOD
PMOD is commercial software and consists of the PBAS basic 
package, with additional modules available for specialized visualiza-
tion and analysis. Commonly, PBAS and PFUS are available to 
allow basic image quantiﬁcation and coregistration of multimodal 
datasets, and the workﬂows described here cover image loading, 
scaling, coregistration, segmentation, and quantitation. Here, 
PMOD version 4.2, including the PBAS and PFUS packages, has 
been used. The PMOD interface does not use the standard ﬁlebar/ 
submenu format, but rather there are a few main interface tabs 
dedicated to particular processing steps, with further tools accessi-
ble via a right-hand interface and individual submenus. As such, 
processing steps are difﬁcult to describe concisely; however, a series 
of video tutorials for small animal image processing based on 
PMOD version 4.1 in PBAS and PFUS made by the manufacturer 
is available on the PMOD website. 
2.3 
AMIDE
AMIDE is an open-source software and was developed at Stanford 
University [36] and consists of a single package that enables multi-
modality image viewing and basic region of interest analyses; 
although in use at many sites, it is no longer actively maintained 
or developed.

Methods 
3.1 
Loading Images 
into VivoQuant and 
Basic Image 
Adjustments 
1. The [File>Data Browser] menu permits opening imaging data 
(see Note 1) from local as well as remote data repositories, such 
as those stored on acquisition instrument servers (e.g., running 
Invicro’s iPACS software). There are various options to search 
for data within these repositories, and these include practical 
features such as place holder characters (e.g., the string *GF* in 
the ﬁelds [Patients Name], [Patient ID], and [Description] 
preselects data with the character sequence “GF” at any posi-
tion within these ﬁelds), individual dataset selection (select 
clicking on the arrow, e.g., CT or PET reconstructions sepa-
rately or combined for overlays), and the option to also append 
a dataset to already opened data (e.g., add a corresponding CT 
dataset to an already open PET dataset). 
2. The [Tools>Pre-processing] menu enables the setting of 
desired scale units (see [NM/PT Convert unit] tick box).

Routine Preclinical PET Image Processing and Analysis
199
Depending on the chosen unit, additional ﬁelds for data entry 
become editable, for example, the ﬁelds to enter animal weight 
and injected dose when converting to SUV scale. 
3. Via the menu [Tools], turn on the tabs [View control] to 
enable manual slice selection with sliders; noting slice numbers 
deﬁning speciﬁc views is recommended. The tab [MIP control] 
allows adjustment of MIP views and basic visualization toolkit 
(VTK) functions, and the tab [Data Manager] permits visual 
adjustment of the scales in individual opened datasets, for 
example, PET and CT. 
4. Each opened dataset is auto-scaled, and a typical example of 
how a raw PET/CT overlay looks like when a newly acquired 
dual-mode image is opened is shown in Fig. 2a. Adjust the PET 
and CT scales taking care that CT signals relevant for anatomi-
cal context, the animal bed, and any sensors remain visible with 
good contrast in the sectional views (see Fig. 2b; see Notes 
2 and 3). 
5. It is recommended to save the opened session in regular inter-
vals (via [File]>[Session]>[Save]). 
3.2 
Loading Images 
into PMOD and Basic 
Image Adjustments 
1. PMOD includes a database functionality where images can be 
loaded directly, this appears in the [DB Load] tab on the main 
window, where images can be selected for loading. DICOM 
data can be loaded via the [DICOM] button at the lower right-
hand corner of the [DB Load] tab, while all available image 
formats can be loaded via the adjacent [AUTODETECT] tab 
(see Note 1). In both cases, once selected, the ﬁles appear in the 
[Selected for loading] window and are loaded using the [Open] 
command. Files are then displayed in the [View] tab (PBAS 
module) and the [Matching] tab (PFUS module). 
2. By default, units are as exported from the scanner. Units can be 
altered in the [Series Information and Editing Window] if 
needed; SUV information (isotope, animal weight, injection 
time and radioactive syringe activities before and after injec-
tion) can be added in the [Edit Subject/Study info] tab in this 
window, allowing the program to calculate SUV. Images can 
also be converted to SUV scale using the [SUV Image Calcula-
tion tool] in the processing tools tab, though here, the ability 
to display images in both original units (e.g., kBq/cc) and SUV 
is lost (see Note 4). 
3. Decay correction and unit calibration information can be 
applied to datasets directly by opening using the [With Opera-
tions] 
button, 
next 
to 
the 
[Open] 
command 
on 
the 
[DB Loading] tab and selecting [Normalization] under 
[Pre-processing Tools] (see Note 5).

Fig. 2 Basic image processing pipeline for publication quality visualization of preclinical PET/CT data. An 
example is shown using data from a previously reported non-invasive cancer metastasis tracking experiment 
[9], in which sodium iodide symporter (NIS)-expressing tumor and metastases were detected alongside 
endogenously NIS-expressing organs by [18 F]BF4

VivoQuant software, which resulted in auto-scaled images for both PET and CT datasets. After (b) CT image 
scale adjustment, the alignment of PET and CT datasets was conﬁrmed to be sufﬁcient for further processing.

4. Slice and frame number are indicated on the upper two sliders 
in the [General Image Display Control] tab, found on the 
right-hand side of the main display; information is indicated 
for the window currently active. The number and type of 
images displayed can be selected in the adjacent [Display 
Layouts]. 
5. Many current instruments provide already decay-corrected 
data as output. Consequently, care must be taken whether it 
is appropriate to manually apply decay correction to the 
datasets. 
6. Image scale lookup tables and range can be selected in the 
[General Image Display Control], with SUV available as an 
option if the relevant data have been entered. SUV allows 
consistent scaling within and between studies, while CT win-
dows can be set to standard Hounsﬁeld Unit values (see Note 
3). Scale application to slice/frame/series/user-deﬁned values 
can be selected via the [Color Table Min/Max]. 
7. Scales for ﬁgure generation can be exported by selecting the 
[scientiﬁc output] option on the [Capture image display] but-
ton, found at the lower right-hand corner of the display. 
8. Save using the icon on the right-hand toolbar [Save all image 
results] will save all current image ﬁles, transformations, and 
volume of interest ﬁles. For multistep analysis, the workspace 
can be saved at each stage for easy recall. 
3.3 
Loading Images 
into AMIDE and Basic 
Image Adjustments 
1. Files are loaded using [File>Import File (specify)] command, 
with the datatype for loading being selected. 
2. By default, units are as exported from the scanner. Units can be 
converted to, for example, %ID/g or SUV by right-clicking on 
the ﬁlename in the left-hand window to bring up the [Modiﬁ-
cation dialog] and entering the required information in the 
[Basic Info] tab under the [Conversion Type] heading; note 
that injected dose must reﬂect activity at the start of the scan 
period for the data loaded; the cylinder factor is used to convert 
existing units to those speciﬁed in the dropdown menu (see 
Note 4). 
Fig. 2 (continued) shown with image areas masked (red-shaded) in all sectional images and the areas outside 
of the mask deleted. (d) Resultant images are displayed as (top) PET-only data and (bottom) appropriate PET/ 
CT fusions. It is good practice to show both panels as the CT can mask some PET signals (see Fig. 3). 
Importantly, an MIP alongside relevant coronal, sagittal, and transversal sections should be shown. A crosshair 
indicating how the three individual sections ﬁt together should be added. Images must include a scale bar for 
the PET data, while for CT data, it is not necessary when CT serves only to provide anatomical context (but 
should be shown if experimentally relevant, for example, when using CT contrast agents). Notably, indicators 
for orientation are recommended; here they mark (L) left, (R) right, (H) head, (F) foot, (A) anterior, and 
(P) posterior sides

Fig. 3 Impact of different look up tables (LUT) on visualization. PET data from Fig. 2D (upper left-hand panel) 
are represented using the same scale but different LUTs (as identiﬁed). “GRAY19’ uses bright shades of grey 
for high signals and dark ones for low signals; this emphasizes high signals but makes low signals difﬁcult to 
distinguish from one another. “NIH FIRE 2” is a LUT with changing colors according to signal levels, which 
facilitates the differentiation of signal levels compared to “GRAY19” (“NIH FIRE 2” is the standard LUT in 
VivoQuant for PET data). Rainbow-style LUTs, for example, the default “RAINBOW” or “SOKOLOV,” remain 
popular despite being problematic as they result in distorted images as well as images that cannot be 
accurately interpreted by people with color weaknesses [42]. “Inverted GRAY19” is the result of simple scale 
inversion of “GRAY19,” which results in too little contrast. This is caused by most pixel intensities being

3. The current location of the cursor in the x, y, and z planes is 
indicated in the lower left-hand corner underneath the list of 
loaded images, while frame number is indicated in the drop-
down menu next to [time:] on the far right-hand side of the 
icon list. 
4. Image scale lookup tables, range, and application settings can 
be selected in the [Colormap/Threshold] tab of the [Modiﬁ-
cation Dialog], found by right clicking on the dataset. 
5. All loaded data can be saved as an AMIDE ﬁle (.xif) using 
[File>Save Study As] command. 
3.4 
Processing of 
Combined PET and CT 
Images in VivoQuant 
Coregistration is an optional step for in-line systems and only 
required if any registration issues are evident. In our example 
data, there was no need for realignment of datasets, but the proce-
dure is outlined in the following. 
1. VivoQuant permits manual as well as automatic realignment of 
image data via translation, rotation, and ﬂipping. Reference and 
input data may be changed separately using the [Reorienta-
tion/Registration] tool, which is in the [Controls + Operators] 
toolbar. We recommend saving registration settings locally as 
they can be useful for applying them to future images in need of 
realignment. 
2. PET and CT voxel sizes differ depending on their acquisition 
and the voxel size in VivoQuant is set by the ﬁrst opened 
“reference” dataset. Automatic coregistration of all opened 
input datasets to the ﬁrst opened “reference” dataset is accessi-
ble using the Pre-processing tool [Tools>Pre-processing]. If 
up-/downsampling of one image to match the other for an 
overlay is required, the Pre-processing tool also permits this 
alongside speciﬁcation of the voxel dimensions. 
3.5 
Processing of 
Combined PET and CT 
Images in PMOD 
When images are loaded simultaneously, CT and MRI data will be 
assigned to the reference image. 
1. After loading, images can be coregistered in the [Reference and 
Matching] Tab. 
Fig. 3 (continued) represented by shades of grey that differ hardly (cf. concept of gamma in greyscale images 
[37]). “IVRT19” represents a better “inverted” LUT as it aids the recognition of relevant signals and represents 
the type of LUT used in clinical PET. Notably, detection of signals depends on the LUT used, which is 
standardized in the clinical setting but not for preclinical experimentation. “STERN” is an example of a LUT 
enabling the appreciation of dim signals as they are presented with high color contrast. This LUT ﬁnds utility in 
thresholding applications. “STEP50” is an example for a multicolor multistep LUT and presents data in deﬁned 
color/saturation bins rather than as a continuum of intensity levels and colors. This can be useful for 
thresholding applications and illustrating data as contour plots

First, the PET data are manually aligned to the CT/MRI 
image using the [Manually shift and rotate the input image 
until it matches the reference image] button, then registration 
type is selected and activated using the tab above the [Match 
Current] button (Rigid registration is most applicable for stan-
dard coregistration). 
2. After coregistration, the transformation matrixes between 
images can be saved alongside the image for subsequent trans-
formation of re-reconstructed data. For dynamic PET scans, 
frames can be summed to aid coregistration using the [Avg] tab 
in the [Tools] Tab. 
3. Commonly, the resolution of the CT scanner is higher than 
that of the PET. To reduce ﬁle sizes and the interpolation of 
PET data, CT images can be downsampled to the resolution of 
the PET scan using the [Rdc] tab in the [Tools] tab.

Images in AMIDE 
Coregistration is an optional step for in-line systems and only 
required if any registration issues are evident. In our example 
data, there was no need for realignment of datasets, but the proce-
dure is outlined in the following. 
1. Images can be manually realigned by adjusting the location 
from the center in each plane using the windows in the [Cen-
tre] tab in the [Modiﬁcation Dialog] window. 
2. Alternately, alignment based on ﬁducial markers can be carried 
out using [Tools>Alignment wizard]. 
3.7 
Cropping Images 
in VivoQuant 
To further reduce image size, images can be cropped to include 
only the animal of interest. This is best carried out on the coregis-
tered image (see Subheading 3.4). 
1. Use the [Cropping] tool, which is in the [Controls + Opera-
tors] toolbar. 
2. VivoQuant also provides an [Autocrop] function, which is 
located within the Pre-processing tool; this searches bound-
aries starting at the end slices and moves toward the center of 
the dataset until a nonbackground voxel is detected in any of 
the image faces. 
3.8 
Cropping Images 
in PMOD 
To further reduce image size, images can be cropped to include 
only the animal of interest. This is best carried out on the coregis-
tered image (see Subheading 3.5). 
1. In the [VOI Analysis] tab, a cuboidal VOI on the PET dataset 
can be created using the [CUBE (Analytic object)] tool and 
adjusted until the animal is encompassed.

2. The data can then be cropped using the [Crop] tool in the 
[Data modiﬁcation] tab, found in the lower right-hand panel; 
apply this to both images. 
3. It is also possible to crop to a cylinder by applying a circular 
ROI to a slice and clicking “apply to all” in the VOI menu tab, 
which appears on the right of the VOI list. 
4. For multiple animal scans, single animals can be cropped from 
the main image datasets before checking coregistration and 
entering SUV information as in Subheading 3.2; they can 
then be saved as individual coregistered datasets. 
3.9 
Cropping Images 
in AMIDE 
To further reduce image size, images can be cropped to include 
only the animal of interest. This is best carried out on the coregis-
tered image (see Subheading 3.6). 
1. Images can be cropped using the [Tools>Crop Active Data 
Set] command. Selected images are displayed as MIPs, and a 
bounding box is deﬁned in each plane by altering the x, y, and z 
slice numbers indicated (which can also be recorded so bound-
ing boxes can be applied consistently to coregistered datasets). 
2. Output datatype can be selected, and the cropped dataset is 
added to the main data list. 
3.10 
Removal of the 
Animal Beds and 
Sensors from 
Preclinical PET/CT 
Images Using 
VivoQuant 
For publication quality images, it is necessary to focus the onloo-
ker’s attention onto the relevant image information. Animal beds 
and any external sensors usually are detected by CT and, hence, 
need to be removed from these images. Manual bed/sensor 
removal is the option of choice in most cases, while automatic 
bed removal is an option if compatible animal beds have been 
used during image acquisition (e.g., the Minerve beds for mice 
and rats). Figure 2a–c illustrates the removal of the animal bed as 
well as the breathing sensor (compare coronal sections between 
middle and bottom rows). 
1. Use the [Cropping] tool, which is in the [Controls + Opera-
tors] toolbar, and draw a contour around the animal with either 
the 
spline, 
freehand, 
or 
thresholding 
drawing 
tools. 
Red-shaded areas show the selected area (see transversal slice 
in Fig. 2c). 
2. Use the [Cut]>[Outside] tool in the same toolbar to cut voxels 
outside the contour. 
3. Repeat until the animal bed and any sensors are completely 
removed. Make sure you save repeatedly between cutting steps 
to be able to return to a partially cut product in case of errors. 
This is noteworthy as there is no “Undo” function for these 
steps in VivoQuant.

Removal of the 
Animal Beds and 
Sensors from 
Preclinical PET/CT 
Images Using PMOD 
1. Go to the [VOI Analysis] tab, and draw a region of interest 
around the animal using any of the available tools in the left-
hand VOI menu. 
2. When the VOI is complete, crop the PET and CT images, as 
described in Subheading 3.8, to remove voxels outside of the 
VOI. VOIs drawn on each slice should be frequently saved. 
The [Mask] command can also be used, setting the voxel values 
outside the VOI to zero rather than deleting them. 
3.12 
Removal of the 
Animal Beds and 
Sensors from 
Preclinical PET/CT 
Images Using AMIDE 
1. First an ROI is deﬁned using the [Edit>Add ROI] and select-
ing 2D or 3D freehand or iso-contour. For Iso-contouring, the 
ROI is named, the threshold deﬁned, the cursor is clicked at the 
desired starting point, and the desired range is set (voxel values 
for the current cursor position appear in the lower left-hand 
corner under the list of loaded images). 
2. For manual delineation, the ROI is named and the left mouse 
button (m1) is used to deﬁne the start point. The voxel size is 
then selected, and the VOI is deﬁned using the mouse, with 
deletion of selected voxels via right click (m3). ROI drawing 
mode is exited using the m2 button (wheel click; a 3-button 
mouse is needed to access these features of the programme). It 
is worth noting that iso-contouring is difﬁcult to apply to 
preclinical images due to the lack of space between the bed 
and the animal, while manual delineation is very time-
consuming. 
3. When the ROI is complete, voxel values within the ROI can be 
set to zero using [Control>right click]. This operation is 
irreversible. 
3.13 
Reporting 
Preclinical PET/CT 
Fusion Images Using 
VivoQuant 
PET signals are not easily attributable to regions of interest without 
anatomical context. In PET/CT fusion images, quantitative infor-
mation is contained in the PET image (hue), whereas the CT image 
(greyscale) provides anatomical context in most cases. Conse-
quently, data visualization requires overlay image. It is, however, 
highly recommended to show a PET-only image as an additional 
panel to allow the onlooker to better appreciate the quantitative 
PET image without potentially distracting CT signals. Ideally, both 
maximum intensity projections (MIP) and individual slices of areas 
of interest should be shown (Fig. 2d). A wide variety of different 
look-up tables (LUT) have been used for PET images (see Fig. 3 for 
selected examples), and it is important that a suitable LUT that 
avoids data misrepresentation (for details on the impact of the 
gamma parameter [37]) is used and that the same LUT is used 
throughout a reported study. The PET image scale should be the 
same in both the PET and the PET/CT image, while CT images are 
usually scaled such that the skeleton and body outline are visible

without generating bright areas in the CT that could interfere with 
PET signal recognition in the overlays. The latter represent data 
misrepresentation, and Fig. 4 demonstrates the impact of different 
relative scales. The PET scale including corresponding units must 
be added to the presented image, while the CT scale, if just for 
anatomical context, is frequently omitted.

Fig. 4 Impact of scaling individual components in PET/CT fusion images. PET only and various PET/CT fusion 
overlay images of the same dataset but with differing relative scales for each modality. Data are from a 
previously reported study using a probe that localizes to the bones [43]. (a) The PET-only image provides best 
visualization of PET signals but lacks anatomical context. (b) An appropriate PET/CT overlay in which PET 
signals remain recognizable in most areas and the CT image provides anatomical context without disturbing 
PET signal recognition. (c) A PET/CT overlay image using a narrower CT scale that results in brighter signals 
from the skeleton; this results in less recognizable lower bone signals. (d) A more extreme scale alteration in 
which the PET scale was widened resulting in existing signals to be presented dimmer, while the CT scale was 
kept the same compared to (c). Here, the image appears as if there was hardly any bone uptake of the 
radiotracer despite this being the main target of that radioisotope in this experiment. This illustrates how PET/ 
CT data could be misrepresented by using inadvertently or deliberately suboptimal image scales; hence, it 
underlines the need for researchers to provide not only images but also quantitative image analysis data

1. To select a LUT, using the Data Manager [DM] tool, right-
click on the shown LUT and select one of the available ones for 
each dataset. We recommend displaying CT data as greyscale 
and PET in hue using either “NIH FIRE2” or one of the 
continuous rainbow LUTs (see Figs. 1 and 3). 
2. Use the above-described scale adjustment procedure (see 
Subheading 3.1). 
3. Use the [File>Save image] export tool to save any individual 
slice, the MIP, or a combined overview image both. File for-
mats available are png, jpg, bmp, gif, and tif. To coexport the 
necessary image scales, choose [smart labels] under [colorbar 
options].

Image Quality 
Control 
Before quantitative analysis of PET data, some image quality con-
trol should be performed. For whole body mouse scans, a region of 
interest encompassing the entire ﬁeld of view (FOV) can be created 
using 
the 
ROI/VOI 
tools 
in 
VivoQuant/PMOD/AMIDE, 
respectively. (Such a ROI/VOI can be saved in a convenient loca-
tion for repeated use.) The total activity in the FOV should be 
calculated and compared with the actual injected dose the animal 
received as part of the imaging experiment. Additionally, activity 
remaining in the tail vein can be assessed (this should be <5%; see 
Note 6). 
3.17 
Image 
Segmentation for 
Quantitation in 
VivoQuant 
Outside of the brain, manual delineation of organs/region of inter-
est is in many cases the gold standard; however, automatic segmen-
tation via a range of thresholding techniques is also useful when an 
organ is sufﬁciently distinct from its surroundings. Whilst thresh-
olding provides in theory better reproducibility than manual analy-
sis, it is important that the same thresholds are universally applied. 
Here, we assume that fused images are displayed with the anatomi-
cal modality as a reference, such that it can inform the delineation of 
VOIs. 
1. Perform manual delineation of regions of interest using the 
[3D ROI] tool, accessible via the [Controls + Operators] tool-
bar. This opens the [Arrow] tab, in which ROIs can be added 
and deleted and various of their properties set (e.g., ROI 
colour, name, transparency, and whether they are displayed or 
hidden). Create an ROI and set its properties. 
2. Switch to the [Sphere] tab, in which ROIs can be painted using 
either “sphere,” “cylinder”- or “cube”-style paintbrushes; their 
size in pixels can be manually set, too. ROIs will be drawn in 
3D, extending to multiple slices, unless the [2D mode] is 
ticked, in which the ROIs are then painted only in one slice. 
Draw the ROI in each of the available slices. 
3. Spline, Freehand, and Bully tools are also available (via the 
[Spline] tab) for ROI drawing in 2D mode (see Note 7). 
4. Undo/Redo functionality is accessible via the [View>Undo] 
or [View>Redo] menu (starting with VivoQuant v3.5 and in 
VivoQuant 2020, which is used here). 
5. Alternatively, automatic thresholding algorithms can be used to 
paint ROIs when switching to the [Magic wand] tab; they 
include “Global” and “Otsu” thresholding [38], both of

Fig. 5 Workﬂow for PET signal quantiﬁcation in ROIs. PET/CT data from Fig. 1 were manually segmented with 
different ROIs created and individually drawn in VivoQuant’s 2D mode in each slice (VivoQuant automatically 
combined them to volumes of interest). Tissues of interest were the primary tumor (beige) and lung 
metastases (see inset, each identiﬁable lesion in a different ROI color). The whole image was calculated 
and tabulated radioactivity concentrations exported, as described in Methods. Selected ROIs (tumor an 
encircled metastases) are shown as examples 
this will either display or export (csv ﬁle format) the results for 
all ROIs in all overlayed image datasets with export conﬁgur-
able for a variety of relevant read-out parameters. A brief work-
ﬂow example is shown in Fig. 5 illustrating the PET/CT MIP 
without and with ROIs drawn, as well as selected examples of 
ROI quantitation from the shown images.

1. Manual delineation of the organ is performed in the [VOI 
Analysis] tab. Individual contours created on an image slice 
are linked to give a region of interest, and regions of interest 
in a slice are linked to give the ﬁnal volume of interest. Con-
tours can be created manually using the polygon or paint tools 
and edited with the [eraser] or [bully] tool until the shape is 
correct in each cross-sectional view displayed in the main 
window. 
2. Further VOI operations (e.g., Union and Intersection) can be 
implemented in the [Group] tab of the VOI list window (see 
Note 8).

3. Importantly, VOI overlap can be set in the [Classiﬁcation 
modes, overlap modes, etc.] tab in the lower right-hand win-
dow, allowing the user to choose whether new VOIs can 
include voxels previously assigned to other VOIs. Create con-
tours using either the [Point-to-point vertex] tool or the 
[Paint] tool. Edit, if necessary, using [Eraser] or [Bully] tools 
until the volume of interest is correct (see Note 8). 
4. A range of thresholding techniques can be applied to the image 
using the iso-contouring tools selectable on the left of the VOI 
list window. 2D and 3D iso-contouring via interactive region 
growing is available via dedicated buttons, while further con-
touring options are directly selectable in the [Iso-contouring 
via region growing] button. Using this control, it is possible to 
apply user-deﬁned thresholds to previously deﬁned VOIs; in 
this way, SUVpeak metrics can be derived from manually seg-
mented tumors. It is important to apply thresholds consistently 
across datasets for accurate comparison. 
5. VOIs can be quantiﬁed using the [Selected Statistics] tab under 
the graph icon above the main VOI list panel. Selected statistics 
are chosen from the available list by clicking the adjacent 
[Select Statistics to be calculated] table A list of the VOI 
TACs is then presented under the [VOI Statistics] tab, with 
statistics selected for display in the right-hand window. Selected 
statistics can be copied to the clipboard or exported as a statis-
tics ﬁle that can be exported into, for example, Microsoft Excel 
for further analysis. Units can also be selected using the [Data 
Unit] buttons at the top of the window.

1. ROIs are created using the [Edit>Add ROI] dialog described 
for bed removal in Subheading 3.12. 
2. See Subheading 3.12 for thresholding techniques for VOI gen-
eration. Thresholding and iso-contouring tools are available. 
3. ROIs can be quantiﬁed using the [Tools>Calculate ROI statis-
tics] command. By default, selected ROIs are applied to 
selected images, but this is adjustable in the dialog. Results 
can be copied to the clipboard, or the raw data can be exported 
directly. 
3.20 
Double-Check 
Correct Use of the ROI/ 
VOI Tools to Avoid 
Illicit Image 
Manipulation 
ROI/VOI tools are powerful and a prerequisite for image quantiﬁ-
cation in PET. It is noteworthy, however, that these ROI/VOI 
tools also empower the user to much more than quantiﬁcation of 
a region; they enable the tempted user to treat the selected regions 
in a different manner compared to other parts of the image. Such 
unequal treatment of different parts of the same dataset simply 
constitutes an illicit image manipulation [39, 37]. Among several 
possible image manipulations accessible through these tools is, for

example, the removal of selected signals from, for example, the PET 
image. We performed such a procedure to demonstrate how this 
leads to false interpretations because of image misrepresentation 
(Fig. 6). As PET data are quantitative, every effort should be made 
to provide quantitative organ data in addition to the images. 
212
Christopher J. Cawthorne et al.
We encourage peer-reviewers to: (i) ask for PET only images 
alongside fused PET/CT images; (ii) check provided images for 
image manipulations (e.g., through contrast enhancements or 
applying appropriate color deconvolution algorithms, such as 
those available in the free ImageJ software package); and (iii) ask 
authors for quantitative results rather than be satisﬁed merely with 
individual images. If there are space concerns raised, these necessary 
data can in most journals be deposited as supplemental data. 
3.21 
Visualization 
and Quantitation of 
Dynamic PET/CT 
Scans in VivoQuant 
For quantitative PET and to better assess the biodistribution of 
novel PET probes over time, dynamic scanning is performed. 
1. Dynamic images are loaded as in Subheading 3.1. 
2. See above Subheading 3.17 for details on segmentations. 
3. Dynamic PET images are ﬁrst rebinned and reconstructed into 
a desired series of frames. Use the [Time Series] operator to 
visualize sets of dynamic scans by playing slice views of each 
image in sequence and navigate there. 
4. Right-click on the activity in the ROI quantiﬁcation table 
generated following Subheading 3.17, and select the [Plot 
data] option in the dropdown menu; the software then gener-
ates the corresponding time-activity curves (see Note 9). 
3.22 
Visualization 
and Quantitation of 
Dynamic PET/CT 
Scans in PMOD/PFUS 
Loading of dynamic PET/CT data is essentially the same compared 
to static images in PMOD, with individual PET frames accessed via 
the main menu by default. 
1. Dynamic PET data are loaded in the same way as static data (see 
Subheading 3.2). For dynamic data, the [Frame] button and 
scalebar become active in the [General Image Display Control] 
tab and individual frames can be selected for display. Frame 
information can be found in the [Edit frame time] tab of the 
[Series Information and Editing Window] window. 
2. Using the [Frame] tab, images can be inspected to detect 
motion that occurred during the scan period. If this is absent, 
images can be summed using the [Avg] button on the 
tools tab. 
3. For co-registration, the entire image can be summed as early 
timeframes provide images more dominated by blood ﬂow and, 
thus, more information for accurate coregistration; this can 
also inform segmentation.

Fig. 6 Example of data misrepresentation by removal of distinct signals. This example demonstrates how 
straightforward it is using software packages as the described ones to deﬁne ROI/VOI and remove signals from 
images. This constitutes data misrepresentation as not all areas of an image are treated in the same way 
[37, 39]. Here, cancer cells expressing the radionuclide reporter NIS were tracked by [18 F]BF4
- -PET. (a) 
Visible signals are from organs with endogenous NIS expression (T/S: thyroid and salivary glands; S: stomach), 
radiotracer excretion (B: bladder), and the in vivo traceable NIS-expressing cancer cells. As it might be not 
important for the cancer cell tracking experiment to visualize stomach and bladder, (b) one might be tempted 
to remove these signals for better visualization of the cancer cells, generating images like in (c) depicting what 
is deemed experimentally relevant only and omitting other organs that perhaps are irrelevant for the study. 
Nevertheless, this misrepresents the image and misleads the observer; here, to think the cancer cells take a 
larger share of the administered radiotracer or to think that images were much “cleaner.” In the opinion of the 
authors, this is unacceptable practice even when mentioned in the ﬁgure caption and should be avoided at all 
costs

Fig. 7 Summing dynamic data to emphasize blood pool for organ VOI deﬁnition. 75-min dynamic [18 F]-FDG 
PET images of a healthy naı¨ve mouse were summed (a) between 0 and 5 min and 5 and 75 min. The liver is 
clearly recognizable in the early summed image. (b) This enabled a spherical VOI (blue circle) to be placed 
within the liver to (c) generate a reference Time Activity Curve. Summed images can also aid with 
coregistration, especially for images acquired on separate instruments 
4. Dynamic images are segmented using the same tools described 
in Subheading 3.18. VOIs can be drawn on individual frames 
and then applied to all frames using the [Apply to all] button in 
the VOI menu, or on a summed image for later application to 
the dynamic dataset; the choice of method depends on the 
nature of the volume of interest. 
5. For illustration of dynamic PET data, a series of slices can be 
presented over time using the [Image Display Layout Conﬁg-
uration] subtab of the image display layouts tab (Fig. 7). 
6. More usefully, MIPs can also be displayed in this window using 
the [3D] tab; however, the LUT scale must be adjusted to give 
the correct SUV range for each timeframe (Fig. 8). 
7. In addition, MIP movies representing the time course of activ-
ity in the animal overlaid onto the anatomical reference can be 
created in the MIP processing tab, commonly uploaded to 
supplementary information. 
8. Generation of TACs from dynamic data is essentially the same 
as for static images described in Subheading 3.18; a graph of 
the VOI TACs rather than a list is then presented under the 
[VOI Statistics] tab, with statistics selected for display in the 
right-hand window. Selected statistics can be copied to the 
clipboard or exported as a statistics ﬁle as previously described.

Saving/ 
Exporting Data for 
Community Sharing 
Using VivoQuant 
The universal ﬁle format and protocol for medical imaging data is 
DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine; *. 
dcm). This format satisﬁes the need of a standardized format for 
transferring and reading medical images, granting access to the data

from any DICOM-compliant device, regardless of the medical 
system used. DICOM ﬁles contain all necessary metadata and can 
be transferred, loaded, and read fast across different platforms, 
including all image analysis software described here.

Notes 
1. VivoQuant 
can 
handle 
multiple 
ﬁle 
formats, 
including 
DICOM (dcm, dicom), TRaster (ras, res., bin), RAW (raw, 
zraw), conventional image formats (png, tif, tiff, jpg, jpeg, 
bmp), plus some more less common ones (img, nii, mhd, 
mha, fdf, dc3, vol). Notably, VivoQuant also provides the 
user with a dedicated ﬁle format to save the session, that is, 
the current workspace, including visualization settings, etc. 
(zipacs). PMOD can handle multiple ﬁle formats, and loading 
via Autodetect can be used in all cases. The main disadvantage 
of this method is it relies on an intelligible and unchanging ﬁle 
structure, which is handled automatically if the database func-
tionality is used. Use of standard orientation relies on correct 
position encoding in the input ﬁle. If needed, orientation can 
be adjusted using the information/Edit Subject/Study info/ 
Subject position tab by selecting the species and correct orien-
tation; orientation markers (e.g., H/F, A/P, and L/R for 
bipeds; CR/CA, D/V, and LE/RT for quadrupeds) should 
then be checked in the main study tab. This is especially impor-
tant 
for 
coregistering 
subjects 
acquired 
on 
separate 
instruments. 
2. Scale adjustment for slices results in unsightly MIPs prior to 
animal bed removal unless the VTK viewer settings are addi-
tionally changed separately. 
3. Scaling for CT images will depend on the region of interest to 
be segmented, with a range typically between -1000 and 3500

Routine Preclinical PET Image Processing and Analysis
217
Hounsﬁeld Units (HU). For presentation of PET-CT as MIP 
images, CT images are usually scaled so that the skeleton and 
body outline are visible. 
4. Best practice is to separately calculate injected doses in Excel, 
such that entries in PMOD can be checked and any issues 
pertaining to scanner export conventions can be identiﬁed. 
Moreover, check FOV region for ID. 
5. Best practice is to keep radiotracer injection records that also 
include a “trafﬁc light” system to indicate whether the injection 
was successful, that is, no or only very minor amounts of 
paravenous leakage observed around the intravenous adminis-
tration site. Including a small series of Eppendorfs containing a 
dilution series of the tracer in a standard volume in the FOV 
allows absolute quantitation to be easily assessed. 
6. Rough surfaces from manually created 3D ROIs can be 
smoothed using the low-pass ﬁlter provided. The [3D ROI/ 
2D mode] tool matches the one available within the [Quantiﬁ-
cation ++] tool of earlier VivoQuant versions. 
7. CT does not provide sufﬁcient contrast to segment all organs in 
the preclinical setting. For the liver, a small sphere can be 
placed in the left lobe to provide an average value. In dynamic 
PET studies, it is often possible to segment the left ventricle of 
the heart or the vena cava from early images and so derive a 
measure of blood activity; however, this will be affected by both 
partial volume effect [41] and spill-out/spill-in depending on 
the radiotracer used. VOIs can also be placed in the thigh 
muscle. 
8. This function can also be applied to study multiple serial scans. 
9. This allows saving ﬁles in formats suitable for speciﬁc imaging 
analysis programmes, for example, Nifti, Analyze, or interﬁle. 
Transfer syntax is also selectable, with FLOAT format data 
being the most accurate.

Radiosynthesis of [18 F]FPenM-C2Am: A PET Imaging Agent 
for Detecting Cell Death 
Flaviu Bulat, Andre´ A. A. Neves, and Kevin M. Brindle 
Abstract 
Imaging agents capable of detecting the extent, timing, and distribution of tumor cell death following 
treatment could be used in clinical trials of novel cancer therapies to get an early indication of efﬁcacy and 
subsequently in the clinic to guide treatment in individual patients. We have shown how the C2A domain of 
synaptotagmin I, which binds the phosphatidylserine exposed by apoptotic and necrotic cells, can be used 
to image cell death (Bulat et al., EJNMMI Res 10(1):151, 2020; Neves et al. J Nucl Med 58(6):881–887, 
2017). We describe here the semi-automated 18 F labeling of the single cysteine residue in the protein 
(C2Am) that had been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis.

Introduction 
There is a pressing need for imaging methods capable of detecting 
the early onset of cell death in tumors following treatment. How-
ever, to date, no targeted imaging agent has been approved for 
routine clinical imaging of cell death. Historically, the major chal-
lenge has been to identify relevant hallmarks of cell death with 
clinical signiﬁcance, and later to develop and validate novel imaging 
agents that can be transferred to the clinic as biomarkers of cell 
death. 
Cell death plays a critical role in cell growth and differentiation, 
tissue homeostasis, and embryonic development and is also an 
important feature of many diseases, including cancer. In oncology, 
monitoring early responses to tumor therapy would allow the rapid 
selection of the most effective treatments and abandonment of 
ineffective therapies, with reduction of deleterious side effects and 
therefore more effective patient management.

Flaviu Bulat et al.
Several molecular alterations that occur in dying cells have been 
exploited historically as targets for imaging of cell death. Many of 
these changes occur during programmed cell death or apoptosis 
including externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner 
to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane bilayer; activation of 
effector caspases; depolarization of the mitochondrial and plasma 
membranes; and loss of plasma membrane integrity, often a late 
event that occurs during necrosis, which is an unregulated form of 
cell death. 
The Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death recommended a 
classiﬁcation based on molecular events [3]. Apoptosis can be 
executed in response to either external (death-domain receptor 
activation) or internal (mitochondrial disruption) stimuli and is 
noninﬂammatory. Necrosis is often inﬂammatory and pathologic, 
frequently occurring following an extreme physicochemical insult, 
including non-physiologic pH exposure, osmotic pressure, or tem-
perature. Apoptosis and necrosis are usually seen as two ends of a 
spectrum and are often inter-connected. For example, late-stage 
apoptotic cells which are not removed by immune cells frequently 
undergo a form of secondary necrosis [4]. Several additional forms 
of regulated cell death have been identiﬁed, including necroptosis, 
pyroptosis, anoikis, entosis, parthanatos, ferroptosis, autophagy, 
mitotic catastrophe, and lysosomal-mediated programmed cell 
death [5]. A dynamic response to stress stimuli often results in 
crosstalk and plasticity between alternative cell death pathways 
[3]. Importantly, in the context of cancer, apoptosis and necrosis 
have dynamic roles in the process of carcinogenesis and often 
mediate the response of malignant tumors to chemo-, radio-, hor-
monal, and immune-therapy [5]. 
To date, a wide range of potential radiopharmaceuticals target-
ing apoptosis have been described for PET imaging [6]. We have 
described recently 
99m Tc- and 
111 In-labeled derivatives of a 
phosphatidylserine-binding imaging agent (C2Am) for imaging 
tumor cell death in vivo, in the form of apoptosis and/or necrosis, 
using SPECT [2]. 
More recently [1], we described an 18 F-labeled derivative of 
C2Am ([18 F]FPenM-C2Am) for PET imaging which has rapid 
renal clearance, resulting in good levels of tumor contrast post-
therapy (tumor-to-muscle ratios of 6–10, at 2 h following intra-
venous administration; Fig. 1). 
We describe here the semi-automated protocol used for the 
production of [18 F]FPenM-C2Am. This chapter describes a proce-
dure developed and implemented on a GE TRACERlab™FXFN 
automated synthesis module which can be adapted to other similar 
systems.

Radiochemistry
Procedures involving radioisotopes should be risk assessed in accor-
dance with local rules and environmental protection agency per-
mits. A PETtrace 800 cyclotron (16.5 MeV proton energy, General 
Electric) was originally used for the production of [18 F]ﬂuoride in 
18 O-water. 
Dose 
calibration 
should 
be 
performed 
using 
a 
CRC-15R (Capintek) system, or similar. Decay correction and 
decay corrected radiochemical yields can be calculated using an 
online calculator (RadPro). 
A TRACERlab FXFN synthesis rig (General Electric; Fig. 3) was 
used to run a pre-programmed sequence to produce the maleimide 
prosthetic group N-5-[18 F]ﬂuoropentylmaleimide ([18 F]FPenM). 
The sequence source used can be found elsewhere [7].

arrow) 
6. Flow the Kryptoﬁx solution (vial 1) through cartridge #1 into 
the reactor. With stirring, heat reactor to 95 °C for 7 min, start 
the helium ﬂow, and vacuum the reactor (to at least 30 kPa) to 
initiate evaporation (see Note 5). 
7. Add acetonitrile (vial 2) in 3 portions allowing for azeotropic 
removal of water (see Note 4). 
8. When the [18 F]ﬂuoride is dry, add the precursor solution (vial 
3) and heat to 92 °C for 12 min (see Note 6). 
9. Add methanesulfonic acid (vial 4) and heat to 160 °C for 6 min 
(see Note 7). 
10. Cool the reactor to approximately 30 °C and add the buffered 
solution from vial 5 (see Note 8). 
11. Flow the reactor contents through cartridge #2 (alumina) into 
the HPLC vial (see Note 9). 
12. Load 5 mL of solution into the HPLC loop and start the 
puriﬁcation (see Note 10). 
13. Cut the product peak and collect it into the SPE ﬂask (see Note 
11). 
14. Push the SPE ﬂask contents through cartridge #3 (C18) (see 
Note 12).

10.2 min. The UV chromatogram (middle) shows peaks at 9.7 min from FPenM. UV chromatogram (lower) 
shows the spiked sample with a FPenM standard added (peak at 9.7 min) 
15. Use vial 8 contents to elute [18 F]FPenM product off cartridge 
#3 into the formulation ﬂask. Then elute the cartridge with 
contents from vial 9 (see Note 13). 
16. Transfer the product into the empty product collection vial 
situated outside the hot cell. 
17. Measure the activity of the [18 F]FPenM prosthetic group and 
perform a QC check to conﬁrm purity (Fig. 3). 
18. Aliquot 100 μL of [18 F]FPenM into the protein vial containing 
100 μg C2Am (see Note 14). 
19. Allow it to react at room temperature for 30 min (see Note 15). 
20. Prime the PD-10 cartridge by ﬂowing through 5 mL of PBS 
(see Note 16). 
21. Top-load the PD-10 with 110 μL of the C2Am conjugate, 
allowing it to be adsorbed into the cartridge. 
22. Load 350 μL PBS through a PD-10 cartridge, and using 
gravity, collect fraction 0 in an HPLC vial. 
23. Load additional 550 μL PBS through the PD-10 cartridge and 
collect fraction 1, containing [18 F]C2Am, in an HPLC vial. 
24. Using a 1 mL syringe, ﬁlter the contents of fraction 1 through 
a 0.22 μm, 13 mm Millex-GV syringe ﬁlter. 
25. Run QC on fraction 1 to conﬁrm purity (Fig. 4).

showing retention time of [18 F]FPenM-C2Am at 12.8 min. Chromatogram B represents the UV (280 nm) 
trace, showing C2Am at 11.9 min ([18 F]FPenM-C2Am). Peaks 1, 2, and 3 (lower) are likely caused by 
dimerization of unlabeled C2Am (disulﬁde bond formation) and aggregation of the dimers. Peak 6 (lower) is 
likely to be ascorbic acid 
26. After 10 half-lives (~20 h), perform the module cleaning pro-
gram: clean vials 1–6 with 2 mL water, followed by 2 mL 
acetone. 2 mL of ethanol is required for vials 7–9. 
27. Dry the vials and lines in situ using either helium or 
nitrogen gas. 
3.2 
Quality Control
1. Perform analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Acquire and analyze 
data using Chromeleon software, or similar. 
2. Use a Primesphere C18-HC 110A (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; 
Phenomenex) analytical column, or similar (Fig. 4). 
3. Use a 10 min long elution with 5–95% ACN:H2O gradient, 
running at 1 mL/min, followed by 3 min of 5:95 ACN:H2O 
column re-equilibration step. 
4. Radioactive species can be detected using a ﬂow-count radio-
HPLC system (Eckert & Ziegler) connected in series to the 
HPLC after the UV detector. 
5. Assess the extent and purity of protein radiolabeling using an 
xBridge BEH 125A (7.8 × 300 mm, 3.5 μm; Waters) size 
exclusion column (SEC) (Fig. 5). 
6. Here, use an isocratic elution method (100% PBS) at 0.7 mL/ 
min for 45 min. An acetonitrile wash between 20 and 40 min is 
required 
to 
elute 
small 
organic 
molecules 
retained 
non-speciﬁcally by the column resin.

Notes 
1. Cartridge #1 does not require pre-conditioning; however, per-
formance can be improved if washed with Na2CO3 (1 M, 
10 mL) followed by water (20 mL). 
2. Pre-conditioning requires a slow ﬂow rate of ~1 mL/min. Air 
bubbles will not disrupt cartridge performance. 
3. After loading [18 F]ﬂuoride on cartridge #1 (QMA), use nitro-
gen ﬂow for 20–30 s to remove excess water and thus accelerate 
the subsequent drying process. 
4. Drying process takes approximately 7–8 min by heating to 95 ° 
C using a steady ﬂow of helium and a vacuum of 30 kPa. If this 
proves insufﬁcient, temperatures up to 120 °C can be used to 
improve ﬂuoride drying. 
5. This is a crucial step that will determine the quality and reactiv-
ity of [18 F]ﬂuoride. A white crystalline powder/residue is the 
ideal looking kryptoﬁx-ﬂuoride product. However, a yellow 
wax can also lead to respectable radiochemical conversion 
yields. 
6. Precursor and the solvent in which it is dissolved must be of 
highest quality and very dry. 
7. Methanesulfonic acid is added to neutralize the carbonate base 
and stabilize the maleimide during the retro Diels-Alder furan 
deprotection step. 
8. It is important to avoid maleimide hydrolysis; therefore, cool 
down reactor to less than 35 °C before adding the acetate 
buffer. 
9. Alumina cartridge ﬁlters retain any unreacted [18 F]ﬂuoride and 
polar organic compounds. If the product is obtained in a low 
yield, measuring the radioactivity of the alumina cartridge 
could provide information about product loss. 
10. Use a bubble detector to effectively load product into the 
HPLC loop with minimal waste. 
11. Expect to collect the product peak at around 14 min (Fig. 6) if  
using the same isocratic solvent mix, a 3 mL/min ﬂow rate, and 
the same size C18 reverse phase column (250 mm × 100 mm). 
12. The product fraction contains acetonitrile, which is diluted by 
the contents of the SPE ﬂask. This ensures that the product is 
retained by the C18 cartridge. 
13. If eluting the C18 cartridge with ethanol ﬁrst followed by the 
HBS buffer, the eluate must not be directed straight into the 
protein vial as the ethanol can denature the protein.

grams. Collected peak starts at 14 min and ends at 15 min 
14. Ensure that the ﬁnal [18 F]FPenM is in the pH range of 
6.4–6.7. This pH will ensure that the maleimide prosthetic 
group is sufﬁciently stable to hydrolysis while allowing Michael 
addition to the protein to occur. 
15. The conjugation reaction of [18 F]FPenM to protein does not 
require stirring or heating. 
16. The PD-10 cartridge storing buffer must be replaced with the 
buffer used for ﬁnal formulation of [18 F]FPenM-C2Am; there-
fore, washing with PBS prior to use is required.

Imaging the Tumor Antioxidant Response with [18 F] 
FSPG PET 
Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand and Timothy H. Witney 
Abstract 
(4S)-4-(3-[18 F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid ([18 F]FSPG) is a ﬂourine-18 labeled glutamate analog that 
enables the noninvasive in vivo imaging of cellular redox status. [18 F]FSPG is transported across the cell 
membrane by the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xc
-, whose expression is upregulated in multiple 
cancer types. The requirement of cystine for the biosynthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant, connects 
[18 F]FSPG tissue retention to the intracellular redox response via system xc
- activity. We herein describe the 
use of [18 F]FSPG positron emission tomography (PET) to image the tumor antioxidant response and 
highlight key methodological considerations. 
Key words [18 F]FSPG, (4S)-4-(3-[18 F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid, PET, ROS, xc

Introduction 
An important hallmark of cancer cells is their metabolic reprogram-
ming, which supports a highly proliferative and metastatic pheno-
type [1]. Aberrant cancer metabolism, however, results in increased 
levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product 
of elevated mitochondrial respiration. To counter the resulting 
toxicity from high ROS production, key pathways that mediate 
redox homeostasis are upregulated. One such adaptation in cancer 
cells is the elevated expression of the transmembrane antiporter, 
system xc
- [2]. System xc
- transports cystine into the cell in 
exchange for glutamate, the most abundant intracellular amino 
acid. Through this transport system, system xc
- is the primary 
source of intracellular cysteine which in turn is used to synthesize 
glutathione (GSH), a powerful antioxidant (Fig. 1). 
Non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 
tumor metabolism was established with the development of the 
radiolabeled glucose analogue [18 F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose

([18 F]FDG), which still remains the most clinically important PET 
radiotracer for cancer imaging today. In recent years, however, 
several other PET radiotracers have emerged, designed to image 
the metabolic rewiring of tumors [3–5]. (4S)-4-(3-[18 F]Fluoro-
propyl)-L-glutamic acid ([18 F]FSPG) is a glutamate analog that is 
bidirectionally transported across the plasma membrane by system 
xc
-, acting as a surrogate marker of its activity [6]. In preclinical 
models of cancer, [18 F]FSPG has been shown to be an accurate 
marker of the tumor antioxidant response and de novo GSH bio-
synthesis [7], which can be used to monitor the response (Fig. 2) 
and predict resistance to chemotherapy [7, 8]. Importantly, [18 F] 
FSPG has been used in patients (Fig. 3) to image several different 
malignancies [9–12], although its ability to image intracellular 
redox state in humans has yet to be determined.

Fig. 1 An overview of the metabolic pathways, substrates, and proteins involved in [18 F]FSPG retention, 
uptake, and efﬂux. System xc
- activity is controlled by the extracellular to intracellular concentration gradients 
of cystine and glutamate. Cystine is reduced to cysteine by the thioredoxin reductase pathway and reduced 
glutathione. Together, with glycine, these three amino acids form the biosynthetic precursors for glutathione 
biosynthesis. For clarity, the TCA cycle and glycolysis have been abbreviated. PPP pentose phosphate

Methods 
3.1 
Drug Treatment: 
Induction of Oxidative 
Stress with TBHP 
1. Seed cells in a suitable format (e.g. 6-well plates) in complete 
medium at a density that will achieve approximately 70% con-
ﬂuency 24 h prior to start of treatment (e.g., 0.5–2.5 × 106 
cells per well in a 6-well plate; see Note 1). 
2. On the day of the experiment, aspirate old medium and add 
fresh new medium containing 200 μM of TBHP (see Note 2) 
1 h prior to further experimental assays. For a 6-well plate, add 
1 mL per well. Include a DMSO vehicle control, a control 
containing an antioxidant, e.g., 5 mM NAC, and TBHP plus 
antioxidant for comparison (see Note 3). 
3.2 
Quantiﬁcation of 
Glutathione Levels in 
Cells 
1. To allow for lower cell densities following drug treatments, 
seed in 6-well plates to separately collect lysates for analysis. 
2. Following drug treatment, place your 6-well plates on ice, 
remove the medium and wash three times with 2 mL of 
ice-cold PBS, aspirating the wash solution each time. 
3. Keep the 6-well plates on ice and add 300 μL of either GSH or 
GSSG lysis buffer. Shake on ice for 5–10 min until lysis is visible 
under a brightﬁeld microscope. 
4. Scrape cells thoroughly on ice and transfer the lysates to pre-
labeled and pre-chilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.

5. Spin down using a microcentrifuge at a minimum of 15,000 × g 
at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. Discard the cell 
pellet and aliquot the supernatant. Aliquots can be frozen at -
80 °C or immediately analyzed for total GSH and GSSG. 
6. Make a GSH standard curve using the supplied 5 mM stock 
solution ranging from 0 to 5 μM no more than 30 min prior to 
reading your plate in a luminometer. 
7. Add 5 μL of cell lysate or standards in triplicate to a white ﬂat-
bottom 96-well plate. 
8. To all wells, add 50 μL of GSH assay buffer and shake brieﬂy. 
9. Additionally, use 10 μL of the lysate to determine the protein 
concentration using the BCA assay. 
10. Add 50 μL of Luciferin Generation Reagent to each well of a 
96-well plate and shake brieﬂy. Incubate at room temperature 
for 30 min, protected from light. 
11. Add 100 μL of reconstituted Luciferin Detection Reagent to 
each well of a 96-well plate. Mix brieﬂy on a plate shaker and 
incubate for 15 min, protected from light 
12. Measure luminescence. 
13. With the luminescence readings, calculate the total GSH and 
GSSG from the GSH standard curve (see Note 4). 
14. Normalize the total GSH and GSSG to the total amount of 
protein (mg/mL) acquired from the BCA assay to obtain total 
GSH/mg and GSSG/mg of protein. The amount of reduced 
GSH/mg is calculated by subtraction of the GSSG content 
from the total GSH. 
3.3 
Assessment of 
Intracellular ROS and 
Cell Death by Flow 
Cytometry 
1. Seed cells prior to treatment such that, besides the treated and 
non-treated cell samples, an unstained control can be included 
(see Note 5). If cells are stained with >1 ﬂuorophore, make sure 
that there are control cell samples stained with a single dye for 
ﬂuorescent compensation. Treat the cells according to 3.1. 
2. For ROS determination, add a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μM of  
CellROX reagent to the medium of each well (i.e., 2 μL o  
2.5 mM CellROX solution to 1 mL medium per well of a 
6-well plate). CellROX is a pan-ROS marker (see Note 6). 
3. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C and remove the medium. 
4. On a 6-well plate, wash cells three times with 2 mL warm PBS 
(37 °C), add 0.3 mL trypsin, and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. 
5. Place the 6-well plate on ice and stop the trypsinization by 
adding 1 mL complete medium. 
6. Collect and spin down the cells in prechilled 1.5 mL Eppendorf 
tubes at 600 × g and 4 °C.

240
Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand and Timothy H. Witney
7. Wash the cells once with 1 mL ice-cold HBSS by centrifugation 
as above, then resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL ice-cold HBBS, 
and keep on ice. Proceed to step 14. 
8. For cell death determination following treatment of cells, 
remove and collect the medium from each well in 2 mL centri-
fuge tubes. 
9. Wash each well once with PBS prewarmed to 37 °C (700 μL for 
a 6-well plate), combining the PBS wash with the retained 
medium. Add preheated trypsin to the cells (200 μL for a 
6-well plate at 37 °C) and incubate the well plates for 
3–5 min in the incubator. 
10. Stop the trypsinization by adding 1 mL of the retained medium 
into each well from its corresponding tube. Place the entire cell 
suspension into the 2 mL tubes. Spin down the cells in Eppen-
dorf tubes at 600 × g and discard the supernatant. 
11. Wash the cells twice by centrifugation using 1 mL HBSS con-
taining calcium and magnesium (see Note 7). 
12. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in the dark with dyes that stain for 
cell death. Usually, a cell-impermeable dye that stains the 
nucleic acids of dead cells, e.g., SytoxRed (ﬁnal concentration 
of 5 nM) or 7-AAD (ﬁnal concentration of 2–20 μM), which 
detect necrotic cells, is combined with Annexin-V (for ﬁnal 
dilution of the stock solution, follow manufacturer’s instruc-
tions) which is a marker of both apoptosis and necrosis. 
13. After a 30 min incubation at 37 °C, place the samples on ice 
and wash once with ice-cold HBSS by centrifugation (at 4 °C) 
and resuspend cells in 0.5 mL ice-cold HBSS. 
14. Determine the levels of ROS and/or cell death on a ﬂow 
cytometer according to standard methodology. 
3.4 
[18 F]FSPG 
Preparation 
1. Obtain [18 F]FSPG in PBS at high radiochemical purity and 
molar activity [13]. 
2. After collection of [18 F]FSPG, behind lead shielding in an 
isotope workstation, calculate the radioactive concentration 
(MBq/mL or μCi/mL) by measuring the activity with a dose 
calibrator (see Note 8). 
3.5 
[18 F]FSPG 
Retention in Cancer 
Cells 
1. 24 h prior to the [18 F]FSPG retention assay, seed a suitable 
number of cells in each well of a 6-well plate (see Note 9). 
2. Treat the cells according to Subheading 3.1. 
3. Label microcentrifuge and gamma counter tubes appropriately. 
4. Upon receiving [18 F]FSPG, determine the radioactive concen-
tration of the [18 F]FSPG stock at the time of experimentation,

taking into account radioactive decay, using the following 
formula: 
At = A0 × e - λt 
1 
λ = ln 2
ð Þ=t1=2 
2
At - radioactive dose at time t 
A0 - original radioactive dose at time zero 
t – elapsed time from initial radioactivity measurement 
λ – decay constant 
t1/2 – radioactive halﬂife 
5. Approximately 0.185 MBq (5 μCi) of [18 F]FSPG is needed per 
well of a 6-well plate in a total of 1 mL complete medium. 
Calculate the volume of the [18 F]FSPG stock that should be 
added per well at the time of experimentation. 
6. Incubate cells for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. While waiting, 
prepare ice-cold RIPA buffer and chill PBS. 
7. Retain 3 × 10 μL aliquots of the diluted 0.185 MBq/mL [18 F] 
FSPG stock and place in gamma counting tubes for use as 
standards (1% of the total added activity). 
8. To include both attached and ﬂoating cells after incubation (see 
Note 10), remove and collect the medium from each well in 
2 mL tubes before placing on ice. See step 12 below for 
attached cells only. 
9. Wash each well once with PBS pre-warmed to 37 °C (700 μL 
for a 6-well plate), combining the PBS wash with the retained 
medium. Add preheated trypsin to the cells (200 μL for a 
6-well plate at 37 °C) and incubate the well plates for 
3–5 min in the incubator. 
10. Stop the trypsinization with the previously retained medium/ 
PBS solution, collect the cells and spin down at 1,200 × g and 
4 °C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the 
pellet in 1 mL ice cold PBS. Wash by centrifugation three 
times at the same speed. 
11. After the last wash, resuspend the cells in 500 μL ice cold RIPA 
buffer and divide the samples for gamma counting and protein 
determination with the BCA assay (see steps 14 to 16). 
12. To assay attached cells only, aspirate the medium from 
each well. 
13. Wash the wells three times with 2 mL ice-cold PBS, then lyse 
the adherent cells through the addition of RIPA buffer (500 μL 
per well in a 6-plate well). Scrape thoroughly with a cell scraper 
to collect all the cells.

242
Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand and Timothy H. Witney
14. Pipette three-ﬁfth of the volume of each well into a gamma 
counting tube and count in a gamma counter. 
15. For the remaining lysate, collect the supernatant by centrifuga-
tion at a minimum of 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet 
the cell debris. Determine the protein concentration in the 
supernatant using a BCA assay. 
16. Calculate the percentage added radioactivity per mg protein (% 
AA/mg) by converting the counts per minute (CPM) to 
counts per mL (each counting tube contains 0.3 mL). Then 
normalize each sample with the mg/mL obtained from the 
BCA assay. Finally convert the fraction to a percentage.
3.6 
ROS Induction In 
Vivo Using Doxil 
1. Set up a suitable subcutaneous mouse model by injecting 105 
to 106 tumor cells subcutaneously on either ﬂank of the mouse 
(see Note 11). Human or mouse tumor cells are injected sub-
cutaneously on the ﬂank of the mouse by lifting the skin 
between your thumb and index ﬁnger and inserting the needle 
into the space created. For further details, see Fig. 4. 
2. Follow tumor growth by measuring the width, height, and 
depth with a caliper (see Note 12). 
3. Start treatment when the tumor reaches a volume of 100 mm3 
(see Note 13). Tumor volume is calculated by using the follow-
ing formula for an ellipsoid: 
V = π 
6 ABC
ð3Þ 
Or alternatively, if the width is hard to measure, as: 
V = π 
6 A2 C
ð4Þ 
A = Length (mm) 
B = Width (mm) 
C = Heigth (mm) 
4. Induce a tumor redox response by administering 10 mg/kg of 
Doxil via intraperitoneal injection (see Note 14). Treat animals 
on days zero, two, and ﬁve [7]. 
5. Perform [18 F]FSPG PET scan prior to and at timed intervals 
after treatment, e.g., 1 and 6 days after treatment [7], as 
described below. 
3.7 
PET/CT Scanner, 
Scanning, and Animal 
Preparation (On Day of 
Experiment; See Note 
15) 
1. Make sure that the appropriate quality control of the PET 
detector has been conducted in advance of the experiment 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
2. Prior to use, condition the X-ray tube by running it for at least 
30 min.

when changing the needle between injections. Always prepare more cell solution than what you aim to inject. 
25-26G needles have a dead volume of circa 50 μL. (d) If necessary, prepare the mouse by shaving the 
injection site with an electrical shaver for ease of injection and tumor measurements. (e) Gently lift the skin of 
the mouse between your index ﬁnger and thumb so that you get a small triangle facing you, with the syringe in 
the other hand pierce the needle through the skin close to the base of the triangle and into the cavity that has 
been created. Be careful not to go too deep so that you penetrate the muscle or scratch/damage the dermis. (f) 
One can keep lifting the skin while injecting; however, the skin can be released when the needle is in place as 
movement is minimized. Usually circa 100 μL of cells are injected. The plunger should move easily without 
any resistance. Resistance is a sign of the injection not being performed correctly, e.g., intradermally. (g) After 
injection, the cell suspension can often be seen at the injection site, which can persist for hours to days, 
particularly when the cells require an extracellular matrix (e.g., Matrigel, Cultrex® , Geltrex™) to grow
3. Move the mice for the ﬁrst scan to a heating box preheated to 
37 °C and lined with absorbent paper. 
4. Turn on the heating plate where the animals will rest during 
cannulation and cover with absorbent paper. 
5. Check the levels of isoﬂurane on the anesthesia rig; reﬁll if 
necessary.

6. Transfer one mouse to an anesthesia box and use a heating 
lamp at an appropriate distance to maintain body temperature. 
7. Set the oxygen ﬂow rate to 0.5–1 L/min. Turn on the isoﬂur-
ane on the anesthesia rig and make sure there is ﬂow to both 
the anesthesia box and the nose cone. At induction of anesthe-
sia, keep the isoﬂurane vaporizer set between 1.5% and 3% (see 
Note 16). 
8. When anesthetized, move the ﬁrst mouse onto the heating 
plate for cannulation and move the second mouse from the 
heating box and into the anesthesia box if more than one 
animal is to be imaged in the ﬁrst scan. 
9. Cannulate the tail vein of the ﬁrst mouse with a syringe 
attached to the cannula containing sterile 0.9% sodium chloride 
[14] and proceed until the desired number of animals are 
cannulated, i.e., four if you are using a mouse hotel for your 
PET/CT scans [15]. Lower the amount of isoﬂurane by 
changing the vaporizer dial between 1 and 2% to maintain 
anesthesia (see Note 16). 
10. Turn on the anesthesia and oxygen delivery system for the 
PET/CT scanner. 
11. Set up a PET/CT protocol consisting of a scout CT, a 10 min 
static PET acquisition, followed by a CT scan for anatomical 
registration and attenuation correction (see Note 17). The CT 
scan can be acquired before or after the PET acquisition, 
depending on the imaging workﬂow. Additionally, dynamic 
scans might be necessary to determine [18 F]FSPG pharmaco-
kinetics (see Note 18). 
12. Draw four syringes containing 3 MBq of [18 F]FSPG each in a 
volume of 50–150 μL. Move these injection syringes onto the 
cannula, replacing the syringes containing sterile 0.9% sodium 
chloride syringes by cutting and reapplying the polyethylene 
tubing onto the new needle [14]. Measure the activity of the 
syringe before and after injection with a dose calibrator and 
take note of the time of each measurement. Use this together 
with the time of injection to correct for radiotracer decay and 
calculate the injected activity using the formula described 
in Subheading 3.5. 
13. Inject the animals with [18 F]FSPG and move the mice onto the 
PET/CT animal bed. Alternatively, the mice can be injected 
when located on the camera. 
14. Run the scout CT. 
15. Use the image from the scout CT to determine the ﬁeld of view 
for the PET and set CT coordinates to match the PET ﬁeld 
of view.

16. Start the PET acquisition for 10 min at 50 min post-injection if 
performing a static scan. Otherwise, simultaneously start the 
scanner and inject the radioactivity when the mice are located 
in the acquisition ﬁeld of view after running the scout CT. 
17. After the imaging session, return the mice to their cages and 
monitor them while they fully recover, or at the experimental 
end point, cull the mice and collect the required tissue (see 
Subheading 3.9).
3.8 
PET Image 
Reconstruction and 
Image Analysis 
1. PET reconstruction varies depending on the PET/CT manu-
facturer. The reconstruction is usually performed on a dedi-
cated computer and the parameters are often speciﬁc for the 
application, i.e., dynamic or static scan. It is highly recom-
mended to correct for decay, scatter, and attenuation, which 
can be done with a CT image as a reference. 
2. Transfer the reconstructed data, i.e., digital imaging and com-
munications in medicine (DICOM) ﬁles, to a computer con-
taining your analysis software. 
3. In the software, perform bed removal, preprocess the images, 
and draw region of interests (ROIs) to obtain quantitative data 
from the images [14]. 
3.9 
Tissue Collection
1. Collect liquid nitrogen in a dewar and collect dry ice in an 
insulated container suitable for storing tissues samples. Label 
microcentrifuge tubes for each planned necropsy with experi-
mental details. 
2. Immediately after tissue excision, move the required tissue into 
the appropriate tube and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Wait 
3–4 min, then move the sample to dry ice with long forceps (see 
Note 19). 
3.10 
Determination 
of GSH Levels in 
Tissues 
1. After the imaging session, return the mice to their cages and 
monitor them while they fully recover, or at the experimental 
end point, cull the mice and collect the required tissue (see 
Subheading 3.9). 
2. Prepare your homogenizer prior to start according to manu-
facturer’s instructions as the tissue needs to be lysed with the 
use of a cooling system which may require dry ice to maintain 
the desired temperature. Alternatively, homogenization can be 
performed in a cold room. 
3. Add up to 0.2 g or 0.2 mL of frozen or fresh tissue to 2 mL 
tubes suitable for your homogenizer containing lysis beads, 
e.g., impact-resistant tubes with Lysing Matrix D. 
4. Add 1 mL ice-cold GSH lysis buffer to the lysate. To a separate 
sample, use the GSSG lysis buffer to determine GSSG.

246
Oskar Vilhelmsson Timmermand and Timothy H. Witney
5. Run the homogenizer at 4 °C for 15 s to lyse the tissue. 
6. Centrifuge the tubes at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min to 
remove 
any 
debris 
from 
the 
solution 
and 
collect 
the 
supernatant. 
7. The supernatant can then be processed similarly to Subheading 
3.2. to determine total GSH, reduced GSH, and GSSG tumor 
tissue concentrations per mg protein.

Notes 
1. Seeding density is dependent on the choice of cell line and 
should be experimentally determined in advance. 
2. A 200 μM concentration of TBHP is likely to induce high levels 
of oxidative stress at early (1–2 h) timepoints prior to cell 
death. The optimal TBHP concentration for individual cells 
can be experimentally determined using CellROX. Alterna-
tively, other drugs that induce high levels of ROS following 
24 h treatment can be used: rotenone (50 mmol/L), auranoﬁn 
(50 mmol/L), antimycin A (1.10 mg/mL), diethyl maleate 
(100 mmol/L), Doxil (200 nmol/L) [7]. 
3. Antioxidants can include NAC (5 mM; 2 h) or Butein 
(100 mM; 24 h) [7]. Caution should be applied with the use 
of NAC as free intra- and extracellular cysteine is liberated, 
which may affect system xc
- activity irrespective of NAC’s 
antioxidant properties. 
4. Note that two moles of GSH is produced for every reduced 
mole of GSSG. 
5. To set up the compensation of the dyes for the ﬂow cytometer 
protocol, the following samples are needed: unstained control, 
untreated stained control, and treated stained control. The 
untreated and the treated population of cells can then be 
mixed in a 50:50 ratio to make a sample containing both a 
positive and a negative population. 
6. To determine generalized intracellular ROS, cell permeant 
probes, such as the CellROX reagents, which ﬂuoresce upon 
oxidation, can be used. Alternatively, a range of ﬂuorescent 
probes are available for the selective assessment of different 
reactive oxygen species (e.g., MitoSOX Red Superoxide Indi-
cator for mitochondrial superoxide), lipid peroxidation (e.g., 
BODIPY® 581/591 C11), or GSH (e.g., ThiolTracker). 
7. Annexin-V binding to phosphatidylserine exposed during apo-
ptosis is calcium-dependent. It is therefore important to keep 
the cell in a buffer-containing calcium.

Imaging the Tumor Antioxidant Response
247
8. For accuracy, when using highly concentrated preps, dilute the 
[18 F]FSPG stock to 9.25 MBq/mL, adding 20 μL of this 
diluted [18 F]FSPG solution to each well. This procedure is 
necessary when collecting both ﬂoating and attached cells. 
Alternatively, when collecting only the attached cells, [18 F] 
FSPG can be diluted to 0.185 MBq/mL in cell culture medium 
and directly added to cells following aspiration of the old 
medium. Special care should be applied in this situation to 
make sure that drug is also supplemented to the culture 
medium (if required) and that an excess volume is prepared 
for all treatment conditions to account for any potential losses. 
9. The extent of drug-induced oxidative stress, cell death, and 
[18 F]FSPG retention can be cell seeding density-dependent. 
Cell seeding density optimization is therefore crucial. 
10. The decision to assay attached cells or to include both attached 
and ﬂoating cells, that is dead or dying cells, can be a crucial 
consideration that one needs to make. If interest is only in 
biochemical changes (e.g., upon sublethal oxidative damage), 
the straightforward approach would be to only assay the 
attached cells. If cell death or biochemical changes closely 
connected to cell death are to be investigated, including all 
cells in the analysis is most likely to be the best approach. 
11. The number of cells used at implantation might have to be 
titrated, as given in the literature. Further, in preclinical molec-
ular imaging, it is common to start with a syngeneic or immu-
nocompromised subcutaneous xenograft model, based on an 
established cell line, for proof of concept. However, these are 
rarely good models of the disease as their growth, microenvi-
ronment, and extent of genetic heterogeneity differ from the 
human disease. There is a large variety of other types of models 
such as patient-derived xenografts (PDX), orthotopic (where 
cells are inoculated in tissue of origin), or genetically engi-
neered mouse models (GEMM) with a phenotype and behav-
ior more similar to human disease [16]. 
12. Monitoring the tumor growth of non-subcutaneous models 
can be challenging. Often these models need to be thoroughly 
characterized so that tumor burden over time can be deter-
mined. There are alternative ways of monitoring tumor growth 
such as bioluminescence imaging of tumor cells transduced 
with luciferase and CT imaging using contrast agents, e.g., in 
models of abdominal and hepatic tumors. Combinations of 
different techniques can make it easier to detect and provide 
a more accurate estimation of the tumor burden. For example, 
[18 F]FDG PET imaging has been used to follow tumor growth 
preclinically, together with anatomical imaging such as CT or

248

magnetic resonance. Here, the [18 F]FDG signal helps with 
tumor localization. 
13. A tumor xenograft size of 100 mm3 is commonly seen as the 
ideal volume for PET imaging studies. At this size, tumors are a 
solid mass and are vascularized, while not too large that they 
have become necrotic. The vascularization of the tumor can 
differ between different cell lines. Further, measuring tumor 
size using calipers has some known pitfalls, including lack of 
accuracy and interpersonal variations in measurements. 
14. There are several routes to administer drugs. Four commonly 
used routes in rodents are intravenous injection, intraperito-
neal injection, subcutaneous injection, and oral gavage. The 
route of administration will determine the drug’s pharmacoki-
netics, efﬁcacy, and off-target toxicity proﬁle. 
15. For a thorough description of how to set up and conduct a 
PET/CT scan, see “Imaging Cancer Metabolism with Positron 
Emission Tomography (PET)” [14]. 
16. The concentration of isoﬂurane on induction of anesthesia is 
usually between 2% and 3%. This is lowered to 1–2% during 
maintenance of anesthesia. Different strains of mice have dif-
ferent tolerance to isoﬂurane, which is further inﬂuenced by 
their general health condition, e.g., disease model, ongoing 
treatments, and the volume of injections during anesthesia can 
lead to lowered tolerance. It is therefore important to carefully 
monitor the mice when anesthetized. 
17. The time it takes to perform a CT scan is usually around 
10 min. 
18. Initially a dynamic scan with injections directly on the animal 
bed of the PET camera at the beginning of the acquisition is 
preferable as this could be used to determine the uptake, 
retention, and efﬂux (i.e., the kinetics) of [18 F]FSPG in the 
model system. When the pharmacokinetics have been estab-
lished, static PET scans of approximately 10 min at a predeter-
mined timepoint after [18 F]FSPG injection leads to a faster and 
more manageable workﬂow as there is no need to perform long 
scans and injections directly on the camera. 
19. Detailed descriptions of routine necropsy and speciﬁc necropsy 
protocols for different purposes, such as ﬁxing tissue for stain-
ing or isolating mRNA, can be found elsewhere [17].

Characterization and Validation of Radiotracer Kinetics 
Using the Langendorff Isolated Perfused Heart

and Richard Southworth 
Abstract 
The Langendorff isolated perfused heart is a physiologically relevant and controllable ex vivo model well 
suited to characterizing and validating novel radiotracers for a wide range of molecular imaging applica-
tions. It allows the monitoring of ﬁrst pass tracer uptake kinetics either as a bolus injection or as a 
continuous infusion in beating myocardial tissue with a high degree of experimental control in terms of 
cardiac workload, perfusion, energy substrate delivery and composition, and drug co-administration. The 
radiotracer pharmacokinetic data that it provides is not contaminated by confounding factors such as 
off-target tracer metabolism, and as a non-imaging technique, time activity curves can be acquired with 
very high temporal resolution. In this chapter, we describe the basic principles and practice for setting up 
and using Langendorff isolated perfused hearts for the assessment of novel radiotracers and outline their 
potential for modeling pathophysiological conditions relevant to cardiovascular disease.

Introduction 
While the initial screening of novel radiotracers is traditionally 
performed in cultured cells as a high throughput and relatively 
inexpensive approach, in vitro assessment can only provide limited 
insight into how radiotracers might behave in vivo. Conversely, 
while the pharmacokinetics and targeting of radiotracers can be 
evaluated in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the level 
of experimental control possible in vivo is often limited, and it is 
difﬁcult to exclude confounders such as tracer metabolism or 
regional variations in perfusion to conﬁrm a radiotracer’s trapping 
mechanism. To bridge this translational gap, ex vivo–isolated per-
fused organ systems are a useful intermediate step: recapitulating

[25] 
Since its ﬁrst description in 1895, Oskar Langendorff’s isolated 
perfused heart technique has been the cornerstone of basic science 
in cardiovascular physiology and biochemistry [1, 2]. By excising 
the heart and cannulating the ascending aorta, it is possible to 
retrogradely perfuse the myocardium under pressure with a 
warmed oxygenated perfusion buffer via coronary ostia and the 
coronary arteries (Fig. 1) to maintain the heart in a viable contrac-
tile state for 1–2  h  (see Note 1). Typically, perfusion buffers are 
delivered under gravity at the arterial pressure appropriate for the 
animal species being used (see Note 2). However, when evaluating 
radiotracer pharmacokinetics, we have found that it is advantageous 
to deliver perfusate at a constant ﬂow using a peristaltic pump 
rather than constant pressure because it allows the delivery of 
radiotracer at a constant rate, which greatly simpliﬁes pharmacoki-
netic modeling and eliminates the potential confounding effects of 
variations in coronary perfusion and radiotracer delivery [3]. Thus, 
rather than maintaining pressure constant and monitoring coro-
nary ﬂow as an indication of preparation stability as is usually done, 
we maintain perfusion constant and monitor changes in perfusion 
pressure with an in-line transducer (Fig. 2, see Note 3).

Radiotracer Screening Using the Langendorff Heart

(top) shows the basic architecture and the positioning of the detectors relative to the perfusion apparatus. 
Photograph (right) shows the perfusion rig secured to a lead-lined backing plate which supports a custom-built 
scaffold. Photograph (left) shows the heart instrumented with the intraventricular balloon, with a horizontally 
mounted γ-detector interrogating the heart via a collimated lead shield 
While we describe here a simple approach using a Krebs-
Henseleit buffer perfusate containing glucose as the sole energy 
substrate, it is also possible to better recapitulate the in vivo situa-
tion by employing more complicated perfusates, variously incor-
porating fatty acids and ketones as additional energy substrates [4], 
perﬂuorocarbons to enhance oxygen carrying capacity [5], or even 
washed blood [6] or erythrocyte suspensions [7, 8]  (see Note 4). It 
is also possible to independently perfuse the left and right sides of 
the heart using a dual-perfusion cannula to enable one side of the 
heart to be used as a control for the other when modeling regional 
low-ﬂow ischemia [9]. The interested reader is directed to the 
following excellent reviews on these topics [10, 11].

254
Friedrich Baark et al.
To characterize and assess the uptake kinetics of radiotracers in 
the ex vivo isolated heart, we have built a system comprising three 
Na/I detectors placed (i) on the arterial input line above the heart, 
(ii) directly adjacent to the heart recording the myocardium, and 
(iii) on the coronary efﬂuent line. The detectors are collimated with 
lead shields and arranged orthogonally to minimize shine through 
from radioactivity in neighboring parts of the apparatus. This 
enables the simultaneous acquisition of time activity curves for 
the radiotracer input functions, cardiac uptake kinetics, and output 
function (efﬂux) [12]. 
In this chapter, we describe this adaptation of Langendorff’s 
original method to enable the characterization and validation of 
radiotracers in a system which allows the modulation of perfusion 
pressure, coronary ﬂow, heart rate, energy substrate delivery, buffer 
oxygenation, and co-administration of drugs as required, while 
simultaneously evaluating radiotracer kinetics when delivered either 
as a bolus or as a constant infusion.

ature to 120 °C. Closed systems are recommended for long-
term use. 
7. Appropriate cannula for animal species of choice. Surgical steel 
recommended. Cannula should have sufﬁcient external diame-
ter to stretch the aorta to achieve a good seal. It is advisable to 
score a series of horizontal grooves into the cannula exterior 
near the tip to increase friction and prevent the heart slipping 
off during cannulation and ensure a watertight seal under 
pressure. 
8. An in-line bubble trap/compliance chamber. This can be con-
structed from an inverted 10 mL syringe with the plunger 
locked in place using a split pin.

Preparation of 
Krebs-Henseleit Buffer 
(KHB) 
All reagents were supplied by Sigma Aldrich Ltd., UK, unless 
otherwise stated. Prepare all solutions and buffers using ultrapure 
deionized water (18 MΩ) and analytical grade reagents. Prepare 
and store all reagents at room temperature (see Note 6). 
1. Krebs-Henseleit Buffer: 0.5 mM NaEDTA, 118.5 mM NaCl, 
11 mM glucose, 6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 25  m  
NaHCO3, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4. Dissolve all reagents in 5 L 
ultrapure water previously saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 by 
continuously gassing via a sintered glass bubble stick for 15 min 
(see Note 4). 
2. Filter using 0.2 μM pore size vacuum ﬁltration system. 
3. Each batch of KHB can be stored at 4 °C for a maximum of 
3 days. Glucose and calcium-free stock solutions (stable for 
1 month) can be made and kept at 4 °C to minimize 
preparation time. 
2.2 
Construction of 
an Intraventricular 
Balloon 
While latex balloons for measuring intraventricular pressure are 
commercially available, we ﬁnd them too thick-walled and compli-
ant to reliably and sensitively transduce pressure changes down the 
pressure line to the transducer.

256
Friedrich Baark et al.
1. Wrap clingﬁlm around the tip of a plastic Luer-tip catheter, and 
tie it securely in place with suture using a long knot such as a 
heaving line to minimize the chance of leakage [13]. 
2. Connect the catheter to a water-ﬁlled 1 mL syringe, which is 
slowly inﬂated to stretch the clingﬁlm until the balloon is 
slightly larger than the internal volume of the left ventricle. 
3. Slowly depress the plunger and reverse it to remove air bubbles 
from the balloon. 
4. Connect the water-ﬁlled bubble-free balloon to a ﬁne hard 
plastic tube and pressure transducer via a Luer-lock 3-way tap.

Methods 
3.1 
Perfusion Rig/ 
Triple-γ-Detector 
System 
A schematic representation and photographs of the isolated heart 
perfusion rig are shown in Fig. 2 (see Note 7). 
1. Secure glass reservoirs, heat exchanger, and cannula block to 
the lab stand assembly using retort clamps. The rig is designed 
to be as compact as possible to minimize heat loss. All tubing 
runs are insulated and water-jacketed wherever possible. 
2. Connect perfusion between the glassware components and 
dedicated peristaltic pump tubing around the pump head. 
Insert 3-way taps under each perfusion reservoir to enable 
purging of bubbles with a 50 mL syringe as necessary. 
3. Position a multi-way connector above the perfusion cannula, 
connected to the bubble trap directly above the cannula. The 
side arms are connected to the arterial input line and the arterial 
line pressure transducer. 
4. Connect water-jacketed glassware to the thermal circulator 
unit (see Note 8). 
5. Both physiological pressure transducers should be clamped 
onto the lab stand, positioned at the same height as the heart. 
6. Insert an injection port between the heat exchanger and can-
nula block. This can either be a T-piece with a rubber septum 
cover for bolus radiotracer injections or tubing running to a 
syringe pump for administration by infusion. A further T-piece 
infusion line can be inserted for parallel drug administration if 
necessary. 
7. The three lead collimated gamma detectors are arranged 
around the perfusion rig, supported using retort clamps to 
measure (i) in the arterial line above the heart, (ii) the heart 
itself, and (iii) the coronary efﬂuent line. The detectors are 
housed in lead collimators, and the apparatus geometry ﬁne-
tuned to ensure minimal shine-through from distal perfusion

257
lines using a sealed radioactive source. Each collimator has a 
detection hole drilled in the base and 2 orthogonal holes drilled 
through the sides to allow the routing of the arterial and 
venous perfusion lines, respectively. 
8. Equip a pressure transducer with a 3-way Luer-lock tap at 
either end. Connect a 1 mL syringe to one tap and ﬁt a pressure 
balloon to the other port on the tap via a long, thin 
non-distensible plastic pressure line. Fill the system with 
water, allowing the balloon to be inﬂated and deﬂated 
remotely. Actuate the syringe and tap the tubing to bleed all 
further air from the system, topping up with water as necessary. 
3.2 
Perfusion Rig 
Setup and Calibration 
1. Fill the reservoir(s) with boiling water and ﬂush the entire 
volume through the perfusion rig to ensure it is clean before 
use. If the perfusion rig has been unused for an extended 
period, ﬂush with 70% ethanol prior to ﬂushing with boiling 
water. 
2. Turn on the circulator and allow rig to warm for 15 min prior 
to ﬁlling the reservoirs with KHB (see Note 9). 
3. Allow warmed and gassed KHB to ﬁll the rest of the perfusion 
rig by opening the 3-way tap at the base of each reservoir. 
4. Fill the bubble trap/compliance chamber, ensuring 2–3 mL  of  
air is retained at the top for elasticity within the perfusion 
system (see Note 10). 
5. Adjust the peristaltic pump speed to deliver 14 mL/min (for 
adult rat heart perfusion) by measuring efﬂuent ﬂow at the 
cannula over a 1-min period (see Note 11). 
6. Calibrate both pressure transducers using a sphygmomanome-
ter (see Note 12). 
7. Perform a ﬁnal check on the perfusion rig including checking 
the ventricular balloon and the rest of the rig for air bubbles. 
Conﬁrm that the perfusate temperature at the cannula is 37 °C 
when running at the prescribed ﬂow rate. 
8. When the ﬁnal checks on the rig have been performed, lower 
the ﬂow rate to a very slow speed (~1 drip every 5 s) to allow 
heart cannulation (see Note 13). 
3.3 
Heart Excision
1. Anesthetize rats via intraperitoneal (I.P.) injection with sodium 
pentobarbital (1 mL/kg) in combination with 800 IU/kg 
heparin to prevent blood clotting in the excised heart. 
2. Once animals are sedated and no longer responding to reﬂex 
tests (blinking test and pedal withdrawal test), access the dia-
phragm by transabdominal incision and carefully expose the 
thoracic cavity.

258
Friedrich Baark et al.
3. Perform a thoracotomy by a bilateral incision along the lower 
margin of the last to ﬁrst ribs, then lift the thoracic bib to 
expose the heart. 
4. Swiftly excise the heart, keeping the scissors aligned along the 
spine to ensure as much of the aortic arch as possible is 
retained, lift it clear, and immediately immerse in ice-cold 
(4 °C) KHB. 
3.4 
Heart 
Cannulation and 
Perfusion 
1. Ensuring that the heart is kept immersed in ice-cold KHB, and 
working quickly, carefully dissect away any excess connective 
and lung tissue. 
2. Make a diagonal cut across the aortic arch at the level of the 
brachiocephalic artery to create an oval cross-section at the end 
of the aorta to facilitate cannulation. 
3. Using two pairs of curved forceps, stretch the aortic arch 
laterally and feed it onto the cannula, alternately advancing 
one side and then the other (much like you would pull on a 
sock). Temporarily hold the aorta in place using an artery clip 
prior to tightly securing it with a suture, located into one of the 
lateral grooves on the cannula to ensure a good seal (see Note 
14). Correct cannulation of the aorta can be conﬁrmed by 
wash-through of residual blood in the efﬂuent immediately 
following cannulation. 
4. Using the peristatic pump, increase the coronary ﬂow rate to 
14 mL/min (see Note 11). 
5. Cut a small incision in the pulmonary artery to allow outﬂow of 
buffer. 
6. Carefully remove the left atrial appendage to allow the deﬂated 
intraventricular balloon to be inserted into the left ventricle. 
7. Using the 1 mL syringe, slowly inﬂate the intraventricular 
balloon while monitoring the left ventricular developed pres-
sure recorded by the pressure transducer to achieve an end 
diastolic pressure of 4–6 mm Hg. Secure the balloon catheter 
in place with modeling clay and a rubber band if necessary. 
8. Pierce the right atrial appendage with the tip of the silver pacing 
wire, pull it through and bend the wire through 90° with 
forceps to hold it in place. Wrap the second cable around the 
cannula and connect both wires to the stimulator unit. 
9. Initiate electric pacing, slowly increasing the voltage until elec-
trical capture is achieved, as denoted by regularization of heart 
rate in the left ventricular pressure readout or widening of the 
QRS complex if using ECG monitoring. 
10. Monitor cardiac hemodynamic parameters to ensure prepara-
tion viability and stability for 10 min prior to initiating any 
experiment (see Note 15).

Radiotracer 
Administration by 
Bolus 
For illustration, we describe a typical protocol for a PET hypoxia 
tracer, although the approach is entirely ﬂexible and amenable to 
any number of other applications [3, 9, 12, 14–23]. A typical 
dataset for this protocol is shown in Fig. 3, allowing the direct 
comparison of a hypoxia probe library, as shown in Fig. 4. 
1. Fill both 0.5 L glass reservoirs with KHB during perfusion rig 
setup. Gas one reservoir with 95% O2/5% CO2, with the other 
reservoir gassed with a lower O2 concentration to investigate 
hypoxia by mixing N2, O2, and 5% CO2 (for pH buffering), 
delivered using a GSM-3 gas mixer. 
2. Initiate monitoring of the arterial O2 partial pressure using the 
in-line Oxylite oxygen probe (see Note 16). 
3. Acquire radioactive counts at the start of the stability period of 
each perfusion experiment with a temporal resolution of 5 Hz.

time–activity curves are shown using the hypoxia-selective PET probe 64 Cu-ATSM displaying input function in

experimental protocol. (c) Changes in perfusate partial pressure of O2 (left) and lactate washout (right)

Fig. 4 Representative time–activity curves from serial bolus injections of PET hypoxia probes. Showing the 
hypoxia-dependent myocardial accumulation of the most clinically evaluated bisthisemicarbazone complex 
64 Cu-ATSM, the next generation complex 64 Cu-ATS which exhibits greater hypoxia selectivity, the clinical gold 
standard 18 F-ﬂuoromisonidazole (FMISO) which displays signiﬁcantly slower pharmacokinetics and lower 
tissue uptake, and 64 CuCl2 as a non-hypoxia selective control. Perfusion with normoxic (white background) 
and hypoxic buffer (grey background). Each spike represents a 1 MBq bolus 
4. Once cannulation and manipulations such as balloon and pac-
ing wire insertion have been completed, a 20 min stabilization 
period is used to ensure contractile function and perfusion 
pressure meet predetermined exclusion criteria (see Note 15). 
5. Following the stability period, determine baseline normoxic 
cardiac trapping and pharmacokinetics using a bolus injection 
of radiotracer (typically 1–5 MBq in 100 μL), using a Hamilton 
syringe into the injection port (see Note 17). 
6. 20 min after the ﬁrst bolus injection, switch the perfusion to 
the second reservoir containing hypoxic buffer. 
7. After 5 min of hypoxic buffer perfusion, administer a second 
bolus injection of radiotracer (1–5 MBq in 100 μL) to obtain 
an index of cardiac retention during early hypoxia. 
8. Administer a ﬁnal bolus injection of radiotracer 20 min after 
the previous one to obtain an index of cardiac retention during 
prolonged hypoxia. 
9. Terminate experiments 20 min after the ﬁnal bolus injection.

3.6 
Radiotracer 
Administration by 
Continuous Infusion 
1. Initiate the acquisition of the radioactivity data at the start of 
the stability period of each perfusion experiment to record 
background activity (determined by averaging the background 
radioactivity counts over a 5-min period immediately before 
the introduction of radioactivity). Subtract these background 
counts from all measurements recorded in the rest of the 
experiment. All data are then corrected for radioactive decay, 
with time zero taken as the time that the ﬁrst bolus was 
injected. 
2. At the end of the stability period, initiate a constant infusion of 
radiotracer via a side arm to the perfusate line by syringe pump 
(see Note 18). 
3. Continue the infusion for 20 min to establish a baseline rate of 
radiotracer uptake (see Note 15). 
4. After the baseline uptake has been established, the experimen-
tal intervention can then be performed (be it induction of 
ischemia, hypoxia, drug administration, modiﬁcation of energy 
substrate delivery, etc.), and the resultant change in radiotracer 
uptake or washout rate recorded. Parallel time-matched con-
trol groups should be included wherever possible, typically 
switching to a reservoir containing vehicle. 
5. Calculate the effect of an intervention on radiotracer accumu-
lation as a ratio between the rates pre-and post-intervention. By 
taking a ratio between these two rates, the units cancel out and 
the ratio is unitless. Decay correct the counts to time zero, and 
differences in the amount of activity infused will not prevent 
direct comparison between experiments [3]. 
3.7 
Radiotracer 
Retention Calculation 
A typical kinetic proﬁle of a radiotracer moving through the heart is 
shown in Fig. 5. This can be used as a guide proﬁle for the tracer 
retention calculation used in this section. The pharmacokinetics can 
be interpreted using simple compartmental models (see Note 19). 
1. Use a simple ratiometric approach to assess the degree of 
trapping by calculating the ratio of the plateau phase (trapped 
component) to the peak activity (dominated by the radioactiv-
ity from the bolus). 
2. The percentage tracer retention for each bolus injection is 
calculated using the following equation: 
TR %
ð
 Þ = 
RCPS 
MCPS 
× 100 
Where TR is the tracer retention, RCPS is the residual 
count per seconds, and MCPS is the maximal count per second. 
RCPS is measured by taking a 2-min average of cps 15 min 
post-tracer injection. MCPS is equal to the maximum recorded 
activity after tracer injection, averaged over 1 s.

262

time-activity curves demonstrating the cardiac uptake of [18 F]dihydroethidine ([18 F] DHE) uptake in hearts 
perfused with vehicle or menadione (50 μM). Black arrow represents treatment, gray shows the baseline rate 
of uptake, and red shows the rate of uptake during treatment. (b) Representative trace of data used to 
normalize uptake of [18 F]DHE over time during control conditions (30–40 min, black) versus vehicle

50 μM menadione infusion (n = 4, ± SD, * = p < 0.05) [3] 
3. Tracer retention of subsequent boli should be calculated in the 
same way, except that an average of cps is taken for 1 min before 
injection, and that as well as background is subtracted from 
that measurement to correct for residual activity left from the 
previous injection.

Notes 
1. It must be appreciated that because of its retrograde nature, the 
Langendorff heart is beating but not performing active work 
(i.e., pumping liquid) against an afterload and is, therefore, in a 
less energetically demanding state compared to the in vivo 
situation.

Radiotracer Screening Using the Langendorff Heart
263
2. We typically perfuse our rat hearts (from 220 to 240 g rats) at 
14 mL/min constant ﬂow, which is the average coronary ﬂow 
that results when hearts of this size are perfused under 100 cm 
H2O (74 mm Hg) constant pressure, which is the normal 
arterial pressure in an adult rat [24]. 
3. More elaborate and physiologically relevant models are avail-
able, but each comes with additional cost in terms of requisite 
expertise and throughput, and a pragmatic approach is recom-
mended to balance the degree of physiological relevance (and 
practical difﬁculty) to the scientiﬁc requirement. In “working 
heart” mode, all four chambers are cannulated, and the heart is 
perfused via the right atrium as it would be in vivo, with the 
ventricles performing active work by pumping against columns 
of liquid in a recirculating manner via a large surface area 
counter-current glass column to replicate lung function and 
resistance. 
4. Perfusion buffers containing proteins and fatty acids tend to 
froth when directly oxygenated by gassing. More elaborate 
perfusion rigs which incorporate membrane oxygenator sys-
tems are required for such work. 
5. Historically, these items have been constructed in-house by 
university glassblowers, but heart perfusion systems and acces-
sories are also commercially available. 
6. To prevent CaCl2 from crashing out of solution, dissolve it in 
~20 mL deionized water and add it to the main volume once all 
other reagents have been dissolved. 
7. Careful consideration should be given to the physical location 
of the perfusion apparatus. Ideally it should be placed in an area 
with minimal through trafﬁc, away from potential draughts and 
direct sunlight which may cause temperature ﬂuctuations. Our 
custom-built frames feature a drip tray which feeds directly into 
a drain designated for radioactive waste to facilitate cleaning 
and drainage with minimal risk of personal exposure. The 
aluminum back plate to the frame is also ﬁlled with lead shot 
to minimize potential radiation exposure into the corridor 
behind our laboratory. 
8. Water-jacketed glassware is connected to the bench-top circu-
lator (positioned above the perfusion rig) with thick-walled 
tubing and routed to ensure that it ﬁlls from the circulator 
outlet port to the lowest point of the perfusion rig ﬁrst. The 
perfusion apparatus is connected in parallel circuits using 
Y-pieces, progressing to the top of the perfusion rig where 
each parallel circuit is then connected to a common outﬂow 
tube which returns to the circulator. This design ensures even 
heating throughout the rig, minimizes the potential for air 
pockets, and allows the most accurate control of buffer tem-
perature at the perfusion cannula.

264
Friedrich Baark et al.
9. Initiate gas ﬂow before ﬁlling the reservoirs with KHB to mini-
mize buffer ingress into the gassing sticks (which is difﬁcult to 
clean subsequently and can become a problematic reservoir for 
bacterial/fungal growth). 
10. This compliance chamber/bubble trap is a crucial component 
of the perfusion rig. Although the heart is not actively pumping 
liquid via the left ventricle, the coronary circulation is under 
pressure. The elasticity within the system that the bubble in the 
compliance chamber affords prevents vascular damage which 
would otherwise result from the heart working directly against 
the peristaltic pump. Furthermore, the KHB is saturated with 
oxygen, meaning that bubbles can periodically seed from 
scratches and imperfections in glassware and tubing, even if 
the perfusion rig is carefully bled for bubbles each time it is 
ﬁlled. Positioning the bubble trap directly above the perfusion 
cannula diverts those bubbles upward, preventing them from 
being forced into the coronary vasculature, which is cata-
strophic for the heart preparation, and can necessitate prema-
ture termination of an experiment. 
11. Since it is being perfused with a crystalloid solution which does 
not have the same oxygen-carrying capacity as blood, the heart 
is nearly maximally vasodilated, meaning that coronary ﬂow is 
signiﬁcantly greater than would be observed in vivo [5]. This 
ﬂow rate is deﬁned as that required to achieve the mean arterial 
pressure for the animal species/size being used, and should be 
determined experimentally for every perfusion rig, as part of 
each investigator’s establishing work. The actual ﬂow rate 
should be measured as mL/min pumped from the cannula, 
and not merely by reading from the digital readout on the 
pump. Delivery by peristaltic pumps is highly dependent on 
the compliance of the pump tubing, and the compression that 
the tubing is under, governed by the tightness of the tension-
ing screw on the pump head (which can change as the tubing 
ages). The digital readout should therefore be calibrated 
against actual ﬂow rate each day. 
12. The pressure transducers and recording system are set up using 
a two-point calibration. A zero baseline is set with the 3-way 
tap open to atmosphere. To set the second calibration point, 
the sphygmomanometer is connected, 3-way tap is closed to 
atmosphere, and the system is pressurized to 100 mmHg. 
13. This should be the minimum required to ensure that no bub-
bles are introduced into the aorta during cannulation. Intro-
ducing buffer into the heart too fast during cannulation will 
enable it to start beating, which will make securing it onto the 
cannula signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult.

Radiotracer Screening Using the Langendorff Heart
265
14. Maintain tension between the suture and the back of the 
cannula as the knot is being tied by locating the suture in one 
of the cannula grooves and pulling it the knot toward you as it 
is tied. This ensures that the suture will not slip off the cannula 
as it is being tightened, which frequently causes the aorta to be 
accidentally tied shut. 
15. We would recommend that any trainee perfusionist should 
establish exclusion criteria against which to compare each prep-
aration, which includes ranges of ideal left ventricular end 
diastolic and developed pressures and perfusion pressures, 
and to use them as a go/no go checklist for whether to proceed 
with or discard each preparation. We would recommend the 
following: (i) heart excision to stable perfusion with inserted 
balloon should be achieved in less than 5 min, (ii) end diastolic 
pressure should be 4–8 mm Hg, (iii) LV-developed pressure 
should be >120 mm Hg, (iv) initial perfusion pressure should 
be no more than ± 10% of that measured in vivo for that 
species, and (v) successful electric pacing capture. 
16. Fully oxygenated KHB has a pO2 of approximately 500 mm 
Hg, which saturates the probe during normoxia (they have an 
operating maximum of 150 mm Hg), but pO2 decreases to 
measurable levels within a minute of switching to hypoxic 
buffer. 
17. Wherever possible, radiotracers should be dissolved in the 
perfusion medium being used. Volumes of radiotracer injec-
tions are kept below 150 μL to avoid any increases in coronary 
perfusion pressure. 
18. Perfusate ﬂow rate from the peristaltic pump should be 
adjusted to account for the additional ﬂow from the side arm. 
The maximum injection rate from the sidearm should not 
exceed 5% of total ﬂow to minimize temperature and buffer 
oxygen ﬂuctuations. 
19. The bolus delivery can be modeled as an instantaneous delivery 
of radioactivity at t = 0 or as a gamma variate function to allow 
modeling of the duration and potential dispersion of the injec-
tion bolus. The activity is then delivered to the heart at a 
constant rate due to ﬂow and perfusion within the extracellular 
space. The tracer can then either exit the heart due to efﬂux or 
be taken up by cardiomyocytes through passive diffusion, per-
meability, or active transport processes. Trapping mechanisms 
can then be modeled as either a reversible or an irreversible 
process. 
20. The ﬁrst 10 min typically exhibit a rapid myocardial loading of 
the vascular space, interstitium, and myocardium, which 
declines to a constant rate of accumulation as the system 
reaches equilibrium.

Abstract 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional imaging modality that involves in vivo 
detection of spatiotemporal changes in the binding of radioactive pharmaceuticals (a.k.a. PET tracers) to 
their target sites in different organs. The development of new PET tracers commonly involves their 
preclinical evaluation in small rodents. Moreover, laboratory animal PET research is now being used with 
progressively greater frequency to complement human PET studies, to investigate in greater depth the 
underlying pathophysiology of human diseases, and to monitor the efﬁciency of novel therapeutic inter-
ventions. Here we describe the steps toward a successful small animal PET study, from tracer formulation 
and image acquisition to data reconstruction and analysis of the acquired scans, with a particular focus on its 
utility for the brain. 
Key words Positron emission tomography, Preclinical imaging, PET tracers, PET image acquisition,

Introduction 
Positron emission tomography (PET) enables detection and 
mapping of discrete physiological processes implicated in cancers, 
heart, and brain diseases. PET radiotracers—radioisotopically 
labeled molecules targeting speciﬁc biomarkers—are administered 
to living subjects via intravenous bolus, infusion, bolus and con-
stant infusion, or inhalation. Following beta-plus decay of the 
radioisotope, a positron (e+ or β+ ) is emitted from the radiotracer 
and, upon colliding with an electron (e-), the two particles annihi-
late to emit two gamma (γ) photons traveling in the opposite 
directions near the speed of light. These γ photons are then simul-
taneously captured by the opposite scintillation detectors located in 
the scanner bore and reconstructed to generate a three-dimensional

[18 F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([18 F]FDG) has been a valuable 
diagnostic PET tool in detecting tumors and their metastases for 
several decades and is now considered the gold standard radiotracer 
in diagnosing and staging various cancers. More recently, PET has 
been rapidly evolving beyond [18 F]FDG, thanks to the develop-
ment of the target-speciﬁc radiotracers for imaging amyloid load 
[1], tau protein aggregates [2], and amino acid decarboxylase [3] in  
neurodegenerative diseases as well as neuroendocrine [4] and pros-
tate tumors [5], to name a few. Validation of all novel PET tracers 
involves their preclinical evaluation in various animal species and 
often begins with imaging of the small rodents. While mice are 
perfectly suited for the evaluation of cancer-targeting onco-radio-
tracers due to the abundance of genetic and xenograft models, the 
small anatomical size of their brains makes the mice models subop-
timal for preliminary studies of the neuro radiotracers. Rats are 
therefore preferred for brain radiotracer development workﬂow 
since they offer a good compromise between brain size, affordabil-
ity, abundant disease models, and translational potential toward 
human studies. Here we present our standard procedures which 
we commonly deploy for brain PET imaging studies in rodents at 
the McConnell Brain Imaging Center (BIC) of the Montreal Neu-
rological Institute (The Neuro). This general imaging protocol 
allowed us to evaluate numerous PET radiotracer candidates for 
imaging melatonin receptors [6], p75 neurotrophin receptors [7], 
and tropomyosin receptor kinase [8]; characterize animal models of 
human diseases [9]; and follow up the therapeutic effect of experi-
mental drugs [10]. While the BIC at the Neuro is equipped with 
Siemens Concordia microPET R4 scanner [11], these general pro-
cedures can be employed with other commercial small animal PET 
scanners.

Methods 
3.1 
Tracer 
Formulation 
This section discusses the formulation for administering living 
animals a typical 18 F- or 11 C-labeled radiotracer puriﬁed by semi-
preparative reversed phase HPLC using typical organic solvents 
(acetonitrile, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, etc.). We do not discuss 
the radiosynthesis of those radiotracers due to the large variability 
of the labeling conditions. 
1. Precondition a suitable disposable reversed phase cartridge, 
such as Waters Sep-Pak® C18, Sep-Pak® tC18, or Oasis® 
HLB with ethanol (minimum 5 mL) followed by water (mini-
mum 10 mL). The choice of cartridge is radiotracer-speciﬁc 
and might require optimization. Most radiotracers, however, 
are efﬁciently trapped and released on the standard Waters 
Sep-Pak C18 Plus Light Cartridge (130 mg sorbent per 
cartridge). 
2. Collect the fraction containing puriﬁed radiotracer from semi-
preparative HPLC in a vial or ﬂask preﬁlled with sterile water, 
minimum 5 times the volume of the HPLC eluate. 
3. Pass the dilute aqueous solution of radiotracer through a pre-
conditioned cartridge (see Note 2). 
4. Wash the cartridge with sterile water (minimum 10 mL) to 
remove the traces of HPLC solvents and possible other polar 
impurities (see Note 3). 
5. Elute the radiotracer trapped on the cartridge with ethanol 
(up to 1 mL) into the sterile vial equipped with a vent ﬁlter 
(see Note 4). 
6. Optionally, attach a sterile ﬁlter between the cartridge and the 
sterile vial to ensure the sterility of the ﬁnal formulation (see 
Note 5). 
7. Pass sterile saline or phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) solu-
tion (up to 10 mL) along the same liquid path into the same 
sterile vial (see Note 6). 
8. Withdraw a small aliquot of the formulated radiotracer for a 
quality control (QC) analysis. 
9. Inject the portion of QC sample on an analytical HPLC 
equipped with the radioactivity detector to ensure:
•
Radiochemical identity by comparing the retention time of 
the radiotracer to that of the non-radioactive standard, tak-
ing into account the delay between the 2 detectors along the 
liquid path.
•
Radiochemical purity (RCP) by ensuring that the peak of 
radiotracer on radioactivity chromatogram accounts for 
≥95% of the total counts.

Preclinical Brain PET Imaging
273
•
Chemical purity, by ensuring there are no other major peaks 
on the UV chromatogram.
•
Calculate the molar activity (Am) by quantifying the amount 
of non-radioactive standard in the sample (see Note 7). 
10. Inject the portion of QC sample on GC system to ensure that 
the concentrations of the toxic organic solvents used in the 
radiosynthesis and semi-preparative HPLC are below the 
corresponding limits (see Note 8). 
11. Measure the pH of the QC sample using calibrated pH-meter 
or validated pH paper to ensure it is in the physiological range 
of 4–8 (see Note 9). 
3.2 
Animal Handling 
and Preparation 
1. Induce anesthesia in the animal by placing it in an induction 
chamber and then ﬁll the chamber with isoﬂurane gas at a 
concentration of 5% with a ﬂow rate of 2–3 L/min of medical 
air (see Note 10). 
2. Following anesthesia induction, weigh the animal, transfer it to 
the scanner bed, and place it on top of a heating pad to 
maintain their body temperature. Maintain the anesthesia for 
the duration of the scan at 1.0–2.5% isoﬂurane with a 0.8 L/ 
min medical air ﬂow, delivered to the animal via a nose cone or 
a mask (see Note 11). 
3. Apply an ophthalmic ointment (natural tears) to both eyes to 
prevent dryness and damage to the cornea. Reapply as needed. 
4. Monitor body temperature of the animal by inserting the tem-
perature probe in the rectum. Observe breathing rate of the 
animal by placing the respiration probe underneath the animal 
chest. 
5. Clean the animal tail with a wet piece of gauze from any debris, 
then sanitize the injection site with an alcohol swab. Insert a 
catheter in the tail vein of the animal for later intravenous 
injection of the tracer. 
6. Position the animal head in the center of the ﬁeld of view 
(FOV) of the scanner. 
3.3 
PET Image 
Acquisition 
This section will be limited to image acquisition of PET tracers that 
bind reversibly to their targets and are administered by intravenous 
bolus injection. 
1. Withdraw a dose of the radiotracer (typically 10–30 MBq, 
depending on the animal weight, molar activity of the radio-
tracer, and scanner sensitivity) into a 1 mL (or exceptionally 
3 mL) syringe (see Note 12). 
2. Administer the entire content of the syringe as a bolus injection 
intravenously in the tail vein via the pre-installed tail vein cannula 
and concomitantly initiate the emission scan from the software.

274
Hussein Bdair et al.
3. Immediately remove the syringe and cannula altogether and 
measure the remaining radioactivity to account for the dead 
volume and the tracer retention on the plastic surfaces (see 
Note 13). 
4. Cover the injection site on the animal’s tail with sterile gauze 
and apply a light pressure for 1 min to stop bleeding. 
5. Continue scan acquisition for the desired duration, typically 1 h 
(see Note 14). 
6. Perform a 9 min transmission scan with the 57 Co point-source 
before or after the emission scan to correct for attenuation and 
scatter (see Note 15). 
7. After the scan conclusion, turn off the isoﬂurane vaporizer and 
place the animal back into their enclosure. Keep the animal 
warm by using an infrared lamp or heated pad. Hydrate the 
animal with 0.2–0.5 mL per 10 g body weight of 0.9% NaCl, 
subcutaneously. 
8. Acquire a 1 h blank transmission scan with the 57 Co point 
source (see Note 16). 
3.4 
PET Image 
Reconstruction 
The section will be limited to image reconstruction of PET scans 
conducted with Siemens Concord microPET R4 scanner. 
1. On the computer that operates the scanner, open the scheduler 
microQView and the microPET Manager (if not previously 
launched for the scan acquisition). 
2. Generate the blank and transmission sinograms from the list-
mode data by setting a histogram conﬁguration ﬁle if not 
already deﬁned. When launching this latter, select all the 
required ﬁles (see Note 17). 
3. Generate the emission sinogram by also setting and launching a 
histogram conﬁguration ﬁle (see Note 18). 
4. Reconstruct the attenuation map from the attenuation sino-
gram by setting a reconstruction conﬁguration ﬁle if not 
already deﬁned. Then launch this latter script and select the 
attenuation sinogram to be reconstructed (ﬁle with an .atn 
extension) (see Notes 19 and 20). 
5. Reconstruct the ﬁnal image (for a static study) or images (for a 
dynamic study) of the 3D activity concentration distribution 
from the emission sinogram by setting a reconstruction conﬁg-
uration ﬁle if not already deﬁned. Then launch this latter script 
and select the emission sinogram to be reconstructed (ﬁle with 
a .scn extension). Select the attenuation ﬁle or the manually 
segmented attenuation ﬁle previously described. The normali-
zation ﬁle is automatically selected. Ensure it is the correct 
calibrated normalization (see Note 21).

PET Image 
Analysis 
The step-by-step descriptions of various PET quantiﬁcation meth-
ods and image analyses are too extensive to cover in this chapter. 
Instead, this section will focus on general PET image processing 
steps that can be used together with more advanced full- or semi-
quantiﬁcation methods. Speciﬁcally, we will describe the steps for 
manual registration and segmentation, quantiﬁcation of standar-
dized uptake value (SUV) and standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR), and generation of a time-activity curve (TAC). While 
there are numerous open-source libraries or software available to 
do image processing and analyses, we will use MINC Toolkit 
software as an example. We will use minimal command options as 
examples, but it does not showcase all usage examples of the MINC 
Toolkit. 
Please note that for the accurate regional quantiﬁcation of the 
brain PET images acquired using a standalone PET camera, a 
structural MR image must be acquired in the same study subject. 
The MRI acquisition sequence and detailed procedures may vary 
and they are not covered in this chapter. Depending on the study 
design, the PET and MR images may be acquired in any order, but 
in a relatively short timeframe, typically within 1 week. The steps 
below describe coregistration (overlapping) of the PET and MR 
images with consequent regional analysis of the former. 
1. Download MINC Toolkit software that is developed at the 
McConnell Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological 
Institute from the following link: http://bic-mni.github.io 
2. Convert the raw PET image with the header information to the 
minc format using the upet2mnc tool: upet2mnc <dynamic_-
PET_image.img.hdr> <dynamic_PET_image.mnc>. 
3. Check if the output MINC image is working by using the 
Display tool: Display <dynamic_PET_image.mnc>. 
4. Check if the output MINC image dimensions are correct by 
using mincinfo tool:mincinfo <dynamic_PET_image.mnc> 
(see Note 22). 
5. Blur the PET image by using the mincblur tool: mincblur
-fwhm <blurring_kernel> <PET_imgae.mnc> <blurred_-
PET_image.mnc> (see Note 23). 
6. Coregister the PET image to the corresponding MR image. To 
do so:
•
Average the frames in the dynamic PET image by using the 
mincaverage
tool:
mincaverage
-avgdim
time
-width_weighted 
<dynamic_PET_image.mnc>
<avera-
ged_PET_image.mnc>.
•
View the averaged reshaped PET and the MR images side-
by-side via using the register tool: register <MRI_image. 
mnc>  <averaged_reshaped_PET_image.mnc> (see Fig. 1 
and Note 24).

Hussein Bdair et al.
Fig. 1 Side-by-side view of the MR (left column) and PET (middle column) images prior to coregistration, using 
the register tool of the MINC Toolkit software
•
Select a minimum of 4 landmarks (e.g., both eyes, the nose 
bone, the base of the skull) in both the PET and 
corresponding MR images (see Fig. 2 and Note 25).
•
Coregister the original dynamic PET image to the space of 
the MR image by using the mincresample tool: mincresam-
ple <dynamic_PET_image.mnc> -transform <transforma-
tion_ﬁle.xfm>
-like
<MRI_image.mnc> 
<transformed_dynamic_PET_image.mnc>. 
7. Create masks/labels of the regions of interest (ROIs). To 
do so:
•
Open the image for the ROI analysis by using the 
Display tool: Display <MRI_image.mnc> (see Fig. 3 and 
Note 26).
•
Using mouse or trackpad, manually draw or color the ROIs 
to be analyzed and saved (see Fig. 4 and Note 27).
•
Once the new masks/labels are ﬁnished, save the ﬁles (see 
Note 28). 
8. Create SUV or SUVR images. To do so:
•
Select the time windows to be averaged together by using 
the mincreshape tool: mincreshape -dimrange time=<-
start_frame>,<end_frame>  <dynamic_PET_image.mnc> 
<reshaped_dynamic_PET_image.mnc>.

•
To calculate SUV, normalize the image by the injected dose 
and body weight ratio by using the mincmath tool: min-
cmath -mult –const <body_weight>/<injected_dose> 
<averaged_ PET_image.mnc> <SUV_PET_image.mnc> 
(see Note 29).
•
To calculate SUVR, get a reference region value by using the 
mincstats tool: mincstats -mask <reference_region.mnc>
-mask_binvalue <your_ROI_label_number> -mean <aver-
aged_PET_image.mnc>.
•
Then, normalize the averaged PET image to the reference 
region value by using the mincmath tool: mincmath -div
-const <reference_region_mean_value> <averaged_PET_-
image.mnc> <SUV_PET_image.mnc>. 
9. Create a time-activity curve. To do so,
•
Select individual time frames by using the mincreshape tool: 
mincreshape
-dimrange 
time=<start_frame>,<end_-
frame>
<dynamic_PET_image.mnc>
<reshaped_dyna-
mic_PET_image.mnc>.
•
Get the ROI value by using the mincstats tool: mincstats
-mask <ROI.mnc> -mask_bonvalue <your_ROI_label_-
number> -mean <individual_frame_PET_image.mnc>.
•
Repeat these steps until all of the frames have been calcu-
lated for each ROI value.
•
Plot these values against the time information of the PET 
scan per frame.

1. A 68 Ge point source and 68 Ge cylinder are needed to produce a 
calibrated normalization ﬁle which is required for the recon-
struction of images. This ﬁle is generated only once, after a 
system setup, or an intervention on a detector module, or 
when the daily quality control test fails. The generation of the 
calibrated normalization ﬁle lies beyond the scope of this 
chapter. 
2. This can be done either manually by withdrawing the dilute 
HPLC eluate into a large syringe (e.g., 50 mL) and passing it 
through a cartridge or semi-automatically by either using a 
syringe dispenser (withdraw and push through method) or 
applying a vacuum (pull method). In case of manual formula-
tion, seek approval of the local radiation safety ofﬁcer (RSO) 
and make sure you are not exceeding the maximum radioactiv-
ity dose that can be handled manually. 
3. Consider placing a stopcock upstream of the cartridge to rap-
idly and conveniently switch the input to the cartridge between 
the dilute HPLC eluate and the sterile water to wash the 
cartridge. 
4. Consider placing a stopcock downstream of the cartridge to 
rapidly and conveniently switch the output from the cartridge 
between the waste and the sterile vial. 
5. Make sure the casing and the membrane of the sterile ﬁlter are 
resistant to neat ethanol. Some ﬁlters with polycarbonate cas-
ings crack and leak when used with ethanol. 
6. PET tracers for brain imaging are typically lipophilic small 
molecules, which require ethanol content in the formulation 
to prevent precipitation and absorption to plastic syringes and 
catheters. The maximum ethanol concentration for animal 
injection is 10% aqueous solution. 
7. Prepare the calibration curve (amount of standard vs. the UV 
area peak) in advance of the PET imaging experiment to quan-
tify the molar amount of tracer. The Am equals the radioactivity 
of 
the 
sample 
divided 
by 
the 
molar 
amount 
of 
the 
non-radioactive compound and is typically measured in 
mCi/μmol or GBq/μmol. 
8. Limits for the most commonly used organic solvents used in 
radiosynthesis and HPLC are acetonitrile, 410 ppm; methanol, 
3000 ppm; tetrahydrofuran, 720 ppm; N,N-dimethylforma-
mide, 880 ppm; N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1090 ppm. For 
more information, refer to USP documents, e.g., https://

9. pH lower than 4 might cause itching or even burning at the 
injection site that will result in twitching of the animal after 
administration. 
10. Take the animal out of the incubation chamber once their 
respiration rate is relatively slower (typically 1–2 min after 
inducing anesthesia). 
11. This step needs to be performed in a timely manner to avoid 
the animal recovering from anesthesia. In case the same iso-
ﬂurane vaporizer is being used for anesthesia induction and 
maintenance, ensure to connect the tubing of the nose cone 
and disconnect the tubing of the induction chamber from the 
vaporizer upon transferring the animal to the scanner bed. 
12. The total injected volume should never exceed 5 mL/kg. 
Therefore, for a typical rat weighing 300–500 g, a 1 mL syringe 
should be sufﬁcient. In terms of the injected activity per body 
weight, the dose largely depends on the sensitivity of the PET 
camera. In our experience, the optimal dose for Siemens Con-
cord microPET R4 camera is about 1 μCi/g (37 kBq/g). Also 
for the baseline scan, the target occupancy by the injected 
molar amount of the ligand ideally should not exceed 1%. 
13. If the time between measurements is longer than 1 min, the 
residual activity measured in the syringe and catheter should be 
corrected for decay to the time of injection using the half-life of 
the PET isotope to accurately calculate the injected dose of 
activity. 
14. Avoid maintaining the anesthesia for longer than 60 min, at 
most 90 min. 
15. Ideally, conduct the transmission scan prior to tracer injection 
if this can be done (make sure the animal is already positioned 
inside the bore of the camera and there is sufﬁcient radioactivity 
available). However, if the transmission scan cannot be per-
formed before tracer injection (e.g., when limited radioactivity 
of the tracer necessitates immediate injection), conduct it after 
the emission scan. Note that there is almost no cross contami-
nation of the transmission scan by the tracer since their respec-
tive energy windows are well apart. 
16. This is done once a day at any time by leaving the FOV empty. 
17. In the “Acquisition Mode” ﬁeld, select “Blank Singles” and 
“Transmission Singles” for the blank and transmission scans, 
respectively. Set the “Histogram Type” as single-slice rebin-
ning (SSRB). Keep the default values for all the other ﬁelds. 
Note that blank and transmission scans must be histogrammed 
with the same parameters (only “Acquisition Mode” differs). 
The blank sinogram should be generated ﬁrst since it will be 
automatically selected to histogram the transmission scan.

18. In the “Acquisition mode” ﬁeld, select “Emission” and deﬁne 
the “Dynamic Framing” according to the protocol parameters 
(in seconds). For the “Data Format” ﬁeld, avoid the default 
value (2-byte integer), especially for the long scans or when 
high activity is injected. Keep the default value for the remain-
ing ﬁelds. 
19. Set the “Reconstruction Algorithm” to “2D FBP” for faster 
reconstructions or to “MAP TR” for higher quality segmented 
reconstructions. Set the desired “Image Zoom” and “Image 
Size” (defaults are 1 and 128, respectively). The other ﬁelds 
should remain with their default values. 
20. The reconstruction of the attenuation map is not a required 
step to generate the ﬁnal emission image. It is a quality control 
step before performing the attenuation and scatter corrections 
for the reconstruction of the emission data. If the map is not 
satisfactory (too noisy or wrong values), one can use the seg-
mentation tool accessible from ASIPro to correct the map. 
From ASIPro menu, select “Tools” > “mu-Map Calibration 
and Segmentation,” choose the attenuation map to be cor-
rected (or a smoothed version of it) and click on “Skip Calibra-
tion.” A segmented map with 5 segments is then displayed 
beside the spectrum of the attenuation values (mu-values) 
and the visualization of the segments. Boundaries and 
mu-values of each segment can be tuned until the obtention 
of a satisfactory segmented map. Then click on “Segment” to 
segment the attenuation map and proceed to the ﬁnal projec-
tion step of the newly segmented map. Click “OK” to obtain a 
new segmented attenuation sinogram (ﬁle with an .atn exten-
sion) and exit the procedure. 
21. Choose a “Reconstruction Algorithm” between “2D FBP” 
and 
“3DRP,” 
which 
are 
fast 
analytical 
algorithms, 
or 
“OSEM2D,” “OSEM3D,” and “MAP,” which are iterative 
methods providing better images at the cost of a slower recon-
struction process. For higher image quality, OSEM3D/MAP 
option should be chosen. Set “Image Zoom” and “Image 
Size” as desired. “Scatter Correction” should be checked and 
“Image Data Type” set to 4-byte ﬂoat. For OSEM3D algo-
rithm, set “OSEM 3D Iterations” to 12, “MAP Iterations” to 
0. “Resolution” is ignored. For the “Uniform” ﬁeld, check 
Resolution and uncheck “Use FastMAP.” For MAP algorithm, 
set “OSEM 3D Iterations” to 0, “MAP Iterations” to 18, “Res-
olution” to 1.8. Check Resolution for the “Uniform” ﬁeld and 
uncheck “Use FastMAP.” The authors recommend the MAP 
algorithm, which generally provides the best image quality. 
Note that the optimal number of iterations for MAP or 
OSEM3D depends on the type of study, more speciﬁcally on

the characteristics of the activity concentration distribution 
inside the scanned animal. The numbers mentioned above are 
generic. 
22. mincinfo <dynamic_PET_image.mnc> will show the dimen-
sion information of the dynamic PET ﬁle. There are length, 
step, and start columns describing each dimension in time: 
zspace, yspace, and xspace. Here, the step and start in the 
time dimension could say unknown for a dynamic PET ﬁle 
because the information can be irregular or arbitrary. For 
example, typically PET scans have increasing time in each 
frame (9 × 30 s, 6 × 1 min, 5 × 2 min, 7 × 5 min) and this 
will be considered irregular time spacing. More detailed infor-
mation can be found in the minc ﬁle header by mincheader 
<file.mnc>. The length of time refers to the number of 
frames. 
23. This step can be performed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) either prior to the PET image coregistration to the MRI 
space or just before calculating SUV. The recommended size of 
a blurring kernel for brain PET images in rodents is twice the 
size of the pixel. 
24. If the MR image is in NIFTI format, convert it to the MINC 
format by using the nii2mnc tool: nii2mnc <MRI_image.nii> 
<MRI_image.mnc>. If the MR image is in DICOM format, 
convert it to the MINC format by using the dcm2mnc tool: 
dcm2mnc <MRI_image.dcm> <MRI_image.mnc>. For optimal 
visualization, change the colormap of the PET and MRI images 
to spectral and gray, respectively. 
25. It is important to note that the ﬁrst image column is the target 
space and the second image column is the source space. Thus, 
the transformation generated from this step should be applied 
to the second image in forward transformation. To select the 
landmarks, place the cursor at the same landmark in both the 
PET and MR images and then tag them by clicking on Record 
Tag in the left panel. To remove a tag, select it from the list of 
tags at the bottom of the image click on Delete Tag in the left 
panel. Save the tags in a .tag ﬁle by naming the ﬁle in the box in 
left panel, between Load Tags and Save Tags, then click on Save 
Tags. Tags can be later recalled by typing the name of the .tag 
ﬁle in the same box and then clicking on Load Tags. Save the 
transformation (.xfm) ﬁle by naming it in the box in the left 
panel below Save Transform, then click on Save Transform. 
Both the .tag and .xfm ﬁles are saved in the same directory of 
the PET image where register was opened. 
26. Both windows are interactive. For example, the color scale can 
be adjusted manually by dragging the top (blue) and bottom 
value (green) lines. Furthermore, the Menu functions have

Preclinical Brain PET Imaging

hierarchies. Enter by clicking on the menu and go back to the 
previous menu by clicking Pop Menu. The Menu function can 
also be controlled by using the computer keyboard as indicated 
on the Menu window. Hover over the Menu key to get the 
virtual help description on the Menu window. 
27. To segment, click on segmenting from the Menu. Start seg-
menting or drawing the mask/label by clicking and holding 
the right-click on the mouse. The size of the paintbrush can be 
changed by clicking XY Radius and putting the appropriate 
size and clicking Enter. The label number can be changed by 
clicking Set Paint Lbl: # and putting in the new label number 
and clicking enter. To delete the segmentation to edit, do the 
same procedure as drawing except also holding the Shift button 
on the keyboard. Repeat the process until the 3D region is 
completed. The next slice of the volume is controlled by the 
+/- keyboard buttons. 
28. To save the ROIs, click on File and click on Save Labels.mnc 
from the Menu. Then a new pop-up window will appear to 
navigate where to save the ﬁle with a speciﬁc name. 
29. To correctly calculate SUV as a unitless value, note the units of 
the raw PET image after the reconstruction. In the example 
above, the units are becquerel per cubic centimeter (Bq/cc). 
Thus, the body weight and injected dose should be converted 
to the same units before normalizing. To convert the body 
weight to liters, assume the density of the tissues to be 1 kg/L. 
The 
general 
formula 
to 
calculate 
the 
SUV 
is: 
SUV-
ROI = (Cimg × BW) ÷ ID, where Cimg is the image-derived 
radioactivity concentration in the ROI in Bq/cc, BW is the 
body weight in grams, and ID is the injected dose in Bq.

CRISPR/Cas for PET Reporter Gene Engineering 
Taemoon Chung, Joseph R. Merrill, and Scott K. Lyons 
Abstract 
The relatively recent discovery of CRISPR/Cas has led to a revolution in our ability to efﬁciently manipu-
late the genome of eukaryotic cells. We describe here a protocol that employs CRISPR technology to 
precisely knock-in a PET imaging reporter transgene into a speciﬁc genetic locus of interest. Resulting 
transcription of the targeted reporter will more accurately mimic physiologic expression of the endogenous 
allele than conventional approaches, and so this method has the potential to become an efﬁcient way to 
generate a new generation of “gold-standard” reporter transgenes. We break down the protocol into three 
experimental stages: how to identify the genomic location that the reporter transgene will be inserted, how 
to practically insert the reporter transgene into the genome, and how to screen resultant clones for the 
correct targeted event.

Introduction 
Reporter transgenes (RTs) have been used for many years as a proxy 
readout for the expression of a gene or the activity of a biological 
process of interest. Cells “light up” when a gene is expressed or a 
molecular pathway is active, and so speciﬁc aspects of cellular biol-
ogy can be readily and non-destructively assessed in vivo during 
development, disease, or following experimental perturbation. 
Frequently, a short piece of relevant promoter sequence 
(<1 kb) is cloned upstream of the RT to regulate its transcription 
and achieve this kind of imaging readout [1, 2]. Although relatively 
quick to make and use, such constructs have several signiﬁcant 
limitations that can ultimately make them misleading. First, not 
all relevant regulatory elements are necessarily present within the 
short promoter fragment employed, and second, the genomic 
integration site of stable expressing cells is random, and so expres-
sion of the reporter can be inﬂuenced by neighboring genomic 
sequences or by epigenetic modiﬁcation of the integration site

(the position effect). Other methods have been developed to try to 
counter these limitations (e.g., “safe-harbor” cloning at the ROSA 
locus [3], BAC cloning [4], or gene targeting via homologous 
recombination [5]), but these either do not address all issues or 
can be signiﬁcantly more technically challenging and time-
consuming to employ.

Since the ﬁrst reports of its ability to efﬁciently cleave double-
stranded DNA with precision in 2012 [6], CRISPR technology has 
advanced at a terriﬁc pace, completely revolutionizing molecular 
biology [7]. Although frequently used to knock-out the expression 
of speciﬁc genes, CRISPR can also be used to precisely introduce 
(or “knock-in”) a reporter transgene at a deﬁned location of the 
genome in practically any eukaryotic cell type of interest. Using an 
approach previously described by others [8, 9], we present here a 
detailed description of the practical steps needed to insert a RT into 
a deﬁned genomic location by this method. Resulting knock-in 
reporters transcribe as the targeted endogenous allele, largely 
obviating the limitations of conventional approaches and giving 
rise to a new gold standard of reporter. With care, reporters can 
be knocked-in in such a manner as to minimally affect the expres-
sion or function of the endogenous allele, which in some cases 
could inadvertently give rise to a cellular phenotype. 
The approach relies upon the transfection of two plasmids into 
the cell line of interest (Fig. 1). One plasmid (which we refer to as 
plasmid A) expresses Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA) that is speciﬁc 
to the knock-in site in the recipient cell genome. The other plasmid 
(denoted here plasmid B) is the donor vector and contains the RT 
expression cassette ﬂanked by short sequences of DNA that do not 
arise in the mammalian genome [8, 9]. Plasmid B also expresses a
Fig. 1 Two plasmid system. This knock-in approach relies upon the co-transfection of two plasmids (denoted 
here as A and B) into the cell line of interest. Plasmid A expresses both the Cas9 enzyme and a gRNA speciﬁc 
to the location in the genome where the RT will be inserted. Plasmid B contains the RT donor sequence that 
will be inserted into the genome, ﬂanked by non-mammalian sequences and a gRNA speciﬁc to that ﬂanking 
sequence

gRNA speciﬁc to those ﬂanking sequences. Upon transfection of 
both plasmids, Cas9 protein and the two gRNAs are expressed. 
Cas9 and the genomic gRNA make a double-strand break (DSB) in 
the genome, and this governs the site of RT insertion. Cas9 and the 
non-mammalian gRNA make DSBs on either side of the RT donor 
sequence, effectively dropping it out from its plasmid backbone as a 
linear piece of DNA. Lackner et al. [8] demonstrated that this linear 
piece of DNA can be incorporated into the genomic DSB by a DNA 
repair process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at a 
practicably useful frequency. When inserted in-frame and either 
between the promoter of the gene of interest and its coding 
sequence (5′ knock-in) or just before the stop codon (3′ knock-
in), the RT donor sequence will transcribe as the endogenous 
targeted allele with minimal disruption (Fig. 2). Any genetically 
encoded RT can be knocked in by this method, but as exempliﬁed 
by this issue dedicated to in vivo PET imaging methods, the use of a 
PET RT (Table 1) would afford the researcher certain unique 
experimental advantages, such as highly sensitive tomographic 
in vivo images of gene expression.

Fig. 2 An overview of how a reporter transgene can be inserted into the genome and minimally affect the 
expression of the targeted endogenous allele. RTs can be inserted at either the 5′ end of the gene of interest, 
immediately upstream of the endogenous ATG start codon, or at the 3′ end, immediately upstream of the stop 
codon. To ensure co-expression, a 2A sequence [12] can be employed between and in the same reading 
frame as both genes. It is also important to ensure that no stop codons are inadvertently introduced between 
the endogenous gene, RT, and 2A sequence during cloning

We break the overall protocol down into three main parts. First, 
how to identify a speciﬁc gRNA sequence and deﬁne the precise 
location of RT insertion into the host cell genome. Second, we 
discuss design considerations for the RT donor sequence and how 
to practically achieve targeting in a cell line of interest. Third, how 
to screen resulting clones for correctly targeted insertion of the 
reporter transgene into the genome. Finally, to aid visualization, we 
illustrate the success of this method with the targeted insertion of a 
ﬂuorescent RT donor sequence to the 5′ end of a gene called 
NQO1, the expression of which indicates that a cell is experiencing 
oxidative stress. 
We assume prior knowledge of basic molecular biology and 
in vitro tissue culture techniques. However, we appreciate that 
CRISPR biology may not be completely familiar to all within the 
molecular imaging research community and have attempted to 
clearly explain the reasoning behind each step. Should further 
background information on CRISPR technology or its many appli-
cations be needed, several excellent general review articles have 
been published recently [7, 10].

Methods 
3.1 
Identify a gRNA 
to Specify the Genomic 
Location of the RT 
Knock-In 
The reporter transgene will be inserted into the genome at the site 
of a CRISPR-mediated double-strand break (DSB). It is therefore 
important to identify a genomic gRNA that is speciﬁc to the locus 
being targeted and with the least potential for off-target activity 
(i.e., with the least number of closely related sequences spread 
throughout the genome). Multiple software programs have been 
developed to identify and rank the speciﬁcity of gRNA sequences, 
such as CHOPCHOP (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) or CRIS-
Pick at the Broad Institute (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ 
gppx/crispick/public). The key practical steps are illustrated by 
Figs. 3 and 4. 
1. Using the open access “Gene” program from the NCBI 
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/), select the relevant 
species and gene of interest. As shown by Fig. 3a, a software 
viewer then displays the genomic organization of that gene (the 
exon and intron boundaries), as well as translated and untrans-
lated sequence of the mRNA transcript. By using the magnify-
ing glass tool, it is possible to zoom in and view the region of 
interest at the single nucleotide level (Fig. 3b). 
2. Select approximately 200 base pairs (bp) of genomic sequence 
for analysis to identify a speciﬁc gRNA. If planning to insert the 
RT donor sequence upstream of the gene of interest, select 
approximately 200 bp of genomic sequence immediately 
upstream and including the ATG start codon. If targeting the 
3′ end of the gene, select approximately 200 bp of sequence 
just before and including the stop codon for gRNA analysis 
(Fig. 2, also see Note 3). 
3. The best genomic gRNA will have low potential for off-target 
activity and be close to either the ATG or stop codon of the 
gene of interest. As shown by Fig. 4, order complementary 
oligonucleotides with the appropriate overhangs to enable efﬁ-
cient cloning into pX330. Alternative Cas9 and genomic 
gRNA expression plasmids will also work with this protocol, 
but the precise gRNA cloning strategy as detailed here will 
likely be different.

Clone Genomic 
gRNA into Plasmid A 
1. Using the results from Subheading 3.1, order sense and anti-
sense oligonucleotides (as illustrated in Fig. 4) and resuspend 
to 10 μM in TNE buffer. 
2. To anneal the complementary oligos, mix 10 μL of both resus-
pended oligos in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Incubate at 95 °C 
for 5 min and allow tube to slowly cool back to room tempera-
ture (25 °C) over 45–60 min. Take 1 μL of annealed oligo and 
dilute 1:50 in TE buffer.

sequence of the gRNA. This is helpful for correct orientation and cloning of the gRNA that will ultimately make 
the DSB in the genome 
3. Cut pX330 plasmid with BbsI restriction enzyme as instructed 
by supplier and run on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel. Cut out 
corresponding DNA band and gel purify with a DNA gel 
extraction kit. 
4. Set up a 20 μL ligation reaction. To 2 μL  of  10× DNA ligation 
buffer (supplied with enzyme) add 50 ng of BbsI cut pX330 
vector (not dephosphorylated), 1 μL of annealed oligo and

Fig. 4 How to clone a genomic gRNA into plasmid A. Note that the sense oligo is identical to the sequence 
returned by the gRNA analysis program. When looking at the genomic sequence, the 3 nucleotides that 
immediately follow the sense oligo will be the ‘NGG’ PAM sequence. The antisense oligo is complementary to 
the sense oligo. The blue bases denote the 5′ overhangs that are complementary to BbsI cut pX330. The green 
base is optional, but it has been suggested that a G residue at +1 is required to efﬁciently initiate transcription 
from the U6 promoter, a RNA polymerase III promoter [19] 
nuclease-free dH2O to 19  μL. Mix gently with a pipette tip, 
then add 1 μL T4 DNA ligase and incubate at room tempera-
ture for 1 h. 
5. Transform competent bacteria with ligated DNA. Take 2 μL of  
ligation reaction and add to 25 μL of competent bacteria (e.g., 
Top10F cells) defrosted on ice, gently stirring with pipette tip. 
Keep tube on ice for 30 min, then heat shock in a 42 °C water 
bath for 45 s and place back on ice for 2 min. Add 1 mL of LB 
broth (no antibiotic) and incubate on a 37 °C shaker for 1 h. 
6. Plate 
out 
100–200 
μL 
of 
transformed 
bacteria 
on 
a 
LB-ampicillin agarose plate and grow colonies overnight at 
37 °C. The next day, pick 12 colonies to grow overnight in 
5 mL liquid cultures at 37 °C in LB-ampicillin broth. The day 
after that, take 1.5 mL of turbid liquid culture and purify 
plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer’s instructions of a plas-
mid miniprep kit. 
7. Quick conﬁrmation of gRNA cloning can be made by running 
an AgeI/BbsI restriction digest of miniprepped plasmid DNA 
on 0.8% agarose gel. The BbsI site is destroyed by successful 
gRNA cloning, and positive clones produce a single 8.5 kb 
band, whereas empty self-ligated plasmid will produce 1 kb 
and 7.5 kb bands. 
8. Successful clones should be further veriﬁed by Sanger DNA 
sequencing with primer U6F1: TACGATACAAGGCTGTTA 
GAGAG.

Fig. 5 Key features and organization of possible RT donor sequences (for plasmid B) for 5′ or 3′ CRISPR-
mediated knock-in. To ensure co-expression of the endogenous allele and RT, it is critical that the inserted RT 
donor and 2A sequences are in the same reading frame as the endogenous allele with no intervening stop 
codons. Key: +ve marker, positive antibiotic selection marker; Reporter, PET and/or ﬂuorescent RT of choice; 
2A, a 2A cassette; Red box, non-mammalian ﬂanking DNA sequence (e.g., Tia1L or Sg-A), and the site of 
CRISPR dependent DSBs to linearize RT donor; pA, poly A sequence; FRT, FRT site for FlpO recombinase-
mediated deletion of positive selection marker (optional for 3′ knock-in, essential for 5′ knock-in, (see Note 
12); U6, RNA pol III promoter to drive expression of Flank gRNA, which will induce Cas9-dependent DSB’s in 
ﬂanking red box sequences. The sequence between red boxes (underlined) will be inserted in the genome 
3.3 
Design 
Considerations for the 
Donor RT Sequence in 
Plasmid B 
The base vector for plasmid B (see Fig. 1) ensures effective 
CRISPR-mediated linearization of the RT donor cassette for inser-
tion at the site of the genomic DSB. The RT donor sequence 
should be positioned between the two ﬂanking non-mammalian 
sequences (e.g., between the red boxes depicted in Fig. 1) b  
standard plasmid cloning methods. We have had success with tar-
geting donor sequences >5 kb in total size via this method. 
The RT donor sequence could be as simple as the reporter 
transgene coding sequence itself. However, as shown in Fig. 5, we  
include additional features that signiﬁcantly enhance the resulting 
knock-in allele. Please see Notes 4 and 5 for an explanation of the 
rationale for including these features. Also see Note 2 for a com-
ment on how to efﬁciently incorporate these elements in plasmid 
B. Overall, an advantage of this gene targeting approach is that it is 
homology-free (see Notes 6 and 7) and so in principle once built, 
plasmid B can be used to target other genomic loci with little to no 
further modiﬁcation required (the genomic location of RT donor 
sequence integration being speciﬁed by the gRNA identiﬁed and 
cloned into plasmid A in Subheading 3.1). 
3.4 
Co-transfection 
Protocol and Selection 
of Targeted Clones 
We illustrate this step of the protocol with the transfection of MIA 
PaCa-2 cells (human pancreatic carcinoma cells) by Lipofectamine. 
DNA amounts, cell numbers, and plate surface area are scalable, but 
we ﬁnd the numbers detailed here ultimately produce a practicable

number of well-isolated antibiotic-resistant clones. Transfection 
conditions will be largely equivalent for many cell types, but may 
need optimization in certain cases. 
294
Taemoon Chung et al.
1. On day 0, seed 5 × 103 MIA PaCa-2 cells onto wells of a 
24-well 
culture 
plate. 
Always 
plate 
one 
extra 
well 
of 
non-transfected cells as a selection control. All the cells in this 
control well should die after the addition of antibiotic selection 
media, conﬁrming that the selection of stable clones has been 
effective. 
2. On day 1, label two microcentrifuge tubes 1 and 2 for each well 
to be transfected. In tube 1, add 1 μL Lipofectamine 3000 to 
49 μL of Opti-MEM reduced serum media. In tube 2, add a 
total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA (a 1:1 molar ratio of plasmids A 
and B; see Note 8) and 1 μL of p3000 reagent, made up to a 
total volume of 50 μL with Opti-MEM reduced serum media. 
3. To prepare the lipid-DNA complex, slowly add the contents of 
tube 2 to tube 1 and gently mix. 
4. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature, then add the total 
100 μL volume to one well of the cells plated the day before. 
5. Incubate transfected plates for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 
6. On day 2, 24 h after transfection, trypsinize cells and plate each 
well on a 10 cm dish. Add antibiotic to the culture media to 
positively select for clones that have stably integrated the RT 
donor. 
7. Surviving clones should become visible 7 to 10 days after 
selection media is added. All cells should be dead in the 
untransfected selection control well. 
8. Pick clones to a 24-well plate. We recommend picking at least 
24 clones and typically observe an approximate 10% gene tar-
geting success rate after antibiotic selection (the success rate 
will vary according to the target gene and the cell line 
employed). 
9. Continue to grow and expand selected clones for around 
another week. Once at 50–70% conﬂuency, trypsinize the 
cells and use half for continued propagation. Isolate genomic 
DNA from the other half for analysis. 
3.5 
Validation of 
Targeted RT Donor 
Knock-In by PCR 
Cells that have stably integrated the RT donor sequence in their 
genome will grow out as antibiotic-resistant clones during selec-
tion. We employ a triple PCR screening strategy (Fig. 6) to efﬁ-
ciently identify which clones have correct on-target integration of 
the RT donor sequence versus random off-target integration. 
Please see Note 9 for an important recommendation about PCR 
reaction optimization and Note 10 for a deeper explanation of the 
rationale for the assay.

are employed to screen antibiotic-resistant clones for successful insertion of the RT donor sequence (ge— 
genome speciﬁc, rep—donor sequence speciﬁc, F1 or F2—forward primer, R1 or R2—reverse primer). The 
majority of clones surviving antibiotic selection should be PCR positive for the internal primer pair, but the 5′
and 3′ junction products can only amplify in correctly targeted clones. (b) The results of a triplePCR screen of 
antibiotic-resistant clones on an agarose gel following the targeting of a GFP cassette to the 5′ end of NQO1 in 
the human pancreatic tumor cell line MIA PaCa-2. (c) Preliminary functional validation of a targeted clone after 
the administration of two therapeutics (auranoﬁn and buthionine sulfoximine) that induce oxidative stress and

1. Isolate genomic DNA from antibiotic-resistant cell clones 
using an appropriate genomic DNA isolation kit. 
2. Use the following standard PCR reaction conditions to analyze 
clones for targeted integration of the RT (note that primer 
sequences, annealing temperature, or MgCl2 concentration 
may require optimization): 2 μL  10× PCR reaction buffer,

296
Taemoon Chung et al.
1 μL 4 mM dNTP mixture, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1  μL 10  μM sense 
primer, 1 μL 10  μM antisense primer, 1 μL DNA template, 
nuclease-free dH2O to  19  μL, then 1 μL Taq DNA polymerase 
(20 μL ﬁnal volume). 
3. Run the samples on a PCR thermocycler, initially for 2 min at 
94 °C, then 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 ° 
C for 30 s, then ﬁnally 72 °C for 2 min. 
4. Run out the PCR reaction products on a 0.8% agarose gel. A 
triple-positive PCR sample indicates that the RT donor has 
been targeted to the desired genomic locus. To conﬁrm that 
the inserted RT and endogenous targeted allele share the same 
reading frame, it is essential to next sequence the 5′ or 3′
junction PCR product. 
5. Cut out the appropriate ﬂanking PCR amplicon from the 0.8% 
agarose 
gel 
and 
purify 
DNA 
with 
an 
appropriate 
gel 
puriﬁcation kit. 
6. Submit recovered DNA and a sequencing primer to preferred 
vendor for Sanger DNA sequencing. A DNA concentration 
between 10 and 20 ng/μL is recommended for sequencing a 
PCR product less than 500 bp in size, 20 ~ 50 ng/μL for sizes 
above 500 bp. 
As a rough estimate, we expect around 10% of all antibiotic-
resistant clones to be on-target and in-frame per experiment. See 
Note 11 about an optional assay to identify additional off-target 
insertions. 
Once successfully targeted clones have been identiﬁed, they can 
be expanded for further experimentation and frozen down as ali-
quots for stock. The positive selection cassette may be removed if 
necessary (see Note 12). To aid visualization of successful targeting, 
Fig. 6b, c shows MIA PaCa-2 cells with a GFP RT targeted to the 
NQO1 locus. In this speciﬁc case, these targeted pancreatic cancer 
cells now express GFP upon the induction of oxidative stress. The 
application of a RT from Table 1 would confer uptake of its respec-
tive tracer and positive contrast on a PET scan.

Notes 
1. This protocol employs the plasmid pX330 as “plasmid A” to 
express the Cas9 enzyme and the genome-speciﬁc gRNA. 
Other Cas9 mutant enzymes have been described with a 
lower frequency of off-target activity [11] and could equally 
be employed here. 
2. To rapidly generate RT donor sequences with multiple features 
(as shown in Fig. 5), we recommend commercial gene synthesis 
as a time- and cost-efﬁcient option. At a minimum, ensure that

Targeted Reporter Transgenes with CRISPR
297
the synthesized fragment of DNA can be readily cloned into 
the empty base vector. The overall size and cost of the synthe-
sized fragment can be reduced by including unique restriction 
sites to incorporate the RT or antibiotic selection cassette as 
one additional cloning step. Correspondingly, the versatility of 
the vector can be increased by ensuring that suitable restriction 
sites are positioned on either side of the RT or antibiotic 
selection cassette, enabling efﬁcient substitution of alternative 
sequences. 
3. DSBs in DNA mediated by CRISPR are reliant upon the 
presence of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in 
the genome immediately adjacent to the identiﬁed gRNA 
sequence. NGG (where N is A, T, C, or G) is the PAM 
sequence for Cas9, and this requirement may limit the total 
number of places that a RT can be inserted into the host cell 
genome. In addition to selecting a gRNA with a predicted low 
rate of off-target activity, it is ideal to make the genomic DSB 
upstream and as close as possible to either the endogenous 
ATG or the stop codon to minimize the amount of coding 
sequence added to or deleted from the endogenous allele. 
4. An explanation of useful genetic and design elements of the RT 
donor sequence in plasmid B (Fig. 5): (1) The base vector for 
plasmid B should either be available upon request (pTia1L-
MCS, Lackner et al. [8]) or from Addgene (e.g., #83576) and 
will ensure effective CRISPR-mediated linearization of the RT 
donor cassette for insertion at the site of the genomic DSB. 
(2) Any genetically encoded RT will work with this protocol, 
but the inclusion of a PET RT (Table 1) will afford the 
researcher several unique experimental advantages for in vivo 
imaging. (3) 2A sequence; to best ensure that the expression 
level of the RT is reﬂective of the targeted endogenous allele 
[12] (also see Note 5). The decision to make a 5′ or 3′ RT 
knock-in depends largely upon the nature of the targeted 
endogenous allele and whether it will tolerate minor amino 
acid additions or deletions at its N- or C-terminus. An IRES 
(internal ribosome entry sequence) [13] could be employed 
here instead to co-express both genes without any residual 
amino acid tag, but the expression level of the RT may not 
reﬂect the expression level of the endogenous gene. Equally, a 
fusion protein of the endogenous targeted allele and the RT 
could be achieved by employing a peptide linker [14] in place 
of the 2A sequence. (4) Positive selection marker; to confer 
antibiotic resistance and allow for the positive selection of cells 
with a stably integrated RT donor sequence. Such a positive 
selection strategy does not discriminate between on- and 
off-target genomic integrations (see Subheading 3.5) but is 
very useful for improving the overall observed frequency of

298
Taemoon Chung et al.
correctly targeted clones by removing all cells without stable 
integration of the RT donor sequence. (5) FRT sites; used to 
ﬂank the positive selection marker and enable its removal in 
correctly targeted clones by in vitro infection of an adeno-FlpO 
vector (see Note 12). After identiﬁcation of a correctly targeted 
clone, the removal of this sequence is optional for 3′ RT knock-
ins, but essential for 5′ RT knock-ins, as the selection cassette 
will be positioned between the endogenous promoter and the 
RT and endogenous gene, blocking their expression. 
5. 2A sequences are around 18–20 amino acids long and during 
translation, a peptide bond fails to form between the terminal 
G and P amino acid residues. This means that when a 2A 
sequence is positioned in-frame between two genes, both 
co-express in equimolar amounts as two separate entities from 
the same mRNA [12]. It is essential that both genes and the 2A 
sequence all share the same reading frame and that no stop 
codons are inadvertently introduced between them. Also of 
note, the upstream gene will have the majority of the amino 
acids encoded by the 2A fused to its C-terminus. The down-
stream gene will have a single proline residue fused to its 
N-terminus. These extra amino acids are therefore a consider-
ation when deciding whether to target the 5′ or 3′ end of the 
endogenous gene to best preserve its function. 
6. This gene targeting approach relies upon a DNA repair process 
termed non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is con-
sidered error prone and frequently results in microdeletion of 
one or more DNA nucleotides at the site of the DSB. DNA 
repair by NHEJ can therefore be frameshifting. To co-express 
the reporter transgene as the targeted allele, it is essential that 
the RT donor sequence is inserted in the same reading frame as 
the endogenous allele. The DSB in the genome typically occurs 
3 nucleotides from the PAM sequence. It is possible that pair-
ing of the predicted genomic DSB with RT donor sequences in 
the relevant 0, +1, and +2 reading frames may increase the 
frequency of successfully targeted clones in the desired reading 
frame. Given the high frequency of genomic sequence micro-
deletion at the DSB however, we routinely use the same donor 
for all our knock-in experiments. 
7. Others have described an alternative CRISPR knock-in 
approach that similarly employs Cas9 to make a speciﬁc DSB 
in the host cell genome, but uses homologous sequence and a 
DNA repair process called homology directed repair (HDR) to 
insert the RT donor sequence into the host cell genome 
[15]. We note that HDR is signiﬁcantly less prone to error or 
microdeletion than the NHEJ repair employed by this 
approach. However, HDR is less efﬁcient than NHEJ and 
only occurs in dividing cells. Moreover, HDR targeting needs

Targeted Reporter Transgenes with CRISPR
299
homologous sequence speciﬁc to each targeted locus added to 
plasmid B, whereas the approach described here is homology 
free and employs a universal donor sequence that can in princi-
pal be targeted to any location in the genome. We reason that 
the approach described here may be most useful to efﬁciently 
generate targeted cell lines, whereas an HDR-based approach 
may be better suited for more precision targeting of murine 
embryonic stem (ES) cells and the generation of transgenic 
mice. 
8. Plasmids A and B will typically be different sizes in terms of 
DNA base pair number. If 0.5 μg of each plasmid were mixed 
for a total transfection amount of 1 μg DNA, there would be 
fewer physical copies of the larger construct relative to the 
shorter construct. Instead, to ensure an equal number of plas-
mid copies in the transfection mix (i.e., a 1:1 molar ratio), it is 
necessary to incorporate the base pair size of the plasmids into 
the calculation. For example, if we wanted to transfect a total of 
1 μg DNA in a 1:1 molar ratio of plasmid A (5 kb) and plasmid 
B (4 kb), we would need to transfect 5/9 × 1 for the μg amount 
plasmid A and 4/9 × 1 for the μg amount of plasmid B (i.e., 
number of kb plasmid A divided by the total plasmid kb trans-
fected, multiplied by the total microgram amount to be trans-
fected). In this hypothetical case, we would transfect a mix of 
0.56 μg plasmid A and 0.44 μg plasmid B to achieve a 1:1 molar 
ratio. 
9. For every targeted locus, it is essential that all three PCR 
reactions are ﬁrst optimized to have conﬁdence in the triple 
PCR screen. Failure to adequately optimize the ﬂanking PCR 
reactions may lead to the erroneous conclusion that targeting 
of the RT donor has been unsuccessful. Accordingly, we ﬁrst 
pilot the targeting of the RT donor with an easy-to-transfect 
cell line from the same species as being targeted. After antibi-
otic selection, we pool all surviving clones and extract DNA for 
PCR analysis. This polyclonal DNA mix will comprise a mix-
ture of on- and off-target RT donor integrants, but impor-
tantly will contain template DNA to optimize the 5′ and 3′
ﬂanking PCR reactions. 
10. For the triple PCR assay depicted in Fig. 6, one PCR amplicon 
is completely internal within the RT donor sequence itself and 
so conﬁrms that the RT donor has stably integrated in the host 
cell genome. All antibiotic-resistant clones should be positive 
for this PCR product, and so this is a useful positive control 
that the DNA being analyzed is of sufﬁcient quality for PCR 
ampliﬁcation. The other two reactions conﬁrm correct target-
ing, with one primer annealing to adjacent genomic sequence, 
the other internal to the RT donor. It is extremely unlikely that 
an amplicon of the predicted size can arise from these primer

300
Taemoon Chung et al.
pairs unless the RT donor has correctly integrated into the 
genome. Amplicon size is typically <500 bp to maximize the 
efﬁciency of PCR ampliﬁcation from a complex genomic DNA 
template. 
11. The triple PCR assay does not determine if additional 
off-target insertions of the RT donor have also occurred in a 
correctly targeted cell. This is typically of minor concern to us 
as we functionally validate the biological readout of correctly 
targeted cells. If the ultimate goal is to produce a transgenic 
mouse, however, we would recommend testing this in the 
context of targeted mouse ES cells. RT copy number can be 
determined accurately by Southern blot or by droplet digital 
PCR [16, 17]. 
12. The inclusion of an antibiotic selection marker in the RT donor 
sequence greatly increases the likelihood of identifying cor-
rectly targeted clones by this method. As shown in Fig. 5, 
however, when targeting the 5′ end of genes, the position of 
the antibiotic selection cassette will block expression of the RT 
and endogenous gene from the endogenous promoter. As 
shown in Fig. 5, we ﬂank the selection cassette with FRT 
sites, such that it can be readily removed from correctly tar-
geted cells by in vitro infection with Adenoviral-FlpO [18], at a 
multiplicity of infection (MOI; the ratio of infectious units to 
cells) of 20–200 for 24 h, or as determined empirically for the 
cell line of interest. Removal of the antibiotic selection marker 
is optional when targeting the 3′ end of genes.

Genetic Engineering of Therapeutic Cells with the Sodium 
Iodide Symporter (NIS) to Enable Noninvasive In Vivo 
Therapy Tracking 
Ben Grimsdell, Adeel Saleem, Alessia Volpe, and Gilbert O. Fruhwirth 
Abstract 
Noninvasive long-term imaging of therapeutic cells in preclinical models can be achieved through introdu-
cing a reporter gene into the cells of interest. Despite important recent developments such as gene editing, 
cell engineering based on lentiviruses remains a mainstream tool for gene transfer applicable to a variety of 
different cell types. 
In this chapter, we describe how to use lentivirus-based genetic engineering to render different candidate 
cell therapies in vivo traceable by radionuclide imaging. We illustrate this reporter gene technology using 
the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), which is compatible with both positron emission tomography (PET) 
and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For preclinical experimentation, we fused 
NIS with a suitable ﬂuorescent protein such as monomeric GFP or RFP to streamline cell line generation 
and downstream analyses of ex vivo tissue samples. We present protocols for reporter gene engineering of 
human cardiac progenitor cells, regulatory T cells, and effector T cells as well as for the characterization 
experiments required to validate NIS-ﬂuorescent protein reporter function in these candidate therapeutic 
cells.

Introduction 
Cell-based therapies represent a rapidly emerging class of promising 
therapeutics. They are developed for the treatment of some of the 
most prevalent human diseases, including cancer and diabetes, and 
have applications for regenerative medicine. Cell-based therapies 
use either cells isolated from the patient (autologous) or those from 
a donor (allogeneic). The type of therapeutic cell used varies widely, 
with clinical trials currently dominated by hematopoietic cells,
Adeel Saleem and Alessia Volpe contributed equally with all other contributors.

mesenchymal signaling cells [1], and lymphocytes, but also, at a 
lesser frequency, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, epithelial cells with 
various others also under investigation [2, 3]. Currently, they are 
largely developed without precise assessment of their in vivo distri-
bution, efﬁcacy, or survival. It would be highly beneﬁcial for both 
preclinical development and subsequent clinical use to assess these 
parameters in situ to enable enhancements in efﬁcacy, applicability, 
and safety [4, 5]. In vivo cell tracking rests on the principles and 
mechanisms of molecular imaging to achieve contrast between cells 
of interest and the other cells of the organism. In some cases, there 
are intrinsic features of the cells of interest that can be exploited for 
the generating of contrast, for example, when cells produce target-
able molecules that show low or no expression in other tissues. 
Under these circumstances, conventional molecular imaging offers 
cell tracking possibilities both preclinically and clinically. However, 
in most in vivo cell tracking scenarios, including all reported cases 
of cell-based immunotherapy, molecular probes, or contrast-
generating features must be introduced to the cells of interest.
304
Ben Grimsdell et al.
Labels can be introduced into cells via two different methodol-
ogies, direct or indirect cell labeling [4, 6]. When long-term cell 
tracking (e.g., beyond 1 week) is desired or fast-expanding cell 
types (e.g., proliferating T cells), indirect cell labeling is considered 
the best option [7]. Indirect labeling requires genetic engineering 
to ectopically express a reporter gene, rendering the traceable cells 
different from the surrounding cells in vivo. The reporter must 
allow the cells to be visualized by molecular imaging in vivo follow-
ing administration of a suitable labeling agent. Therefore, the 
relatively simple process of molecular imaging can be performed 
repeatedly allowing the genetically modiﬁed cells to be tracked 
noninvasively over time. Currently, the most promising clinically 
compatible imaging technology for this purpose is positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) [4]. 
First proof-of-principle for clinical reporter gene-afforded cell 
tracking has already been demonstrated using a viral reporter and 
PET imaging [8]. In contrast to foreign reporter genes, host 
reporter genes are endogenous proteins. Importantly, host repor-
ters should be endogenously expressed only in a very limited num-
ber of host tissues to ensure favorable contrast and overcome any 
immunogenicity issues intrinsic to foreign reporters [4]. One of the 
most promising host radionuclide reporter genes is the human 
sodium iodide symporter (NIS), which has been shown to be well 
tolerated in different cell types including cancer cells, cardiomyo-
cytes, stem cells as well as effector and regulatory T cells [9– 
14]. Importantly, it was also shown that the radioactivity levels, 
which can be expected to be taken up into T cells through NIS use, 
during imaging, did not cause lasting DNA damage in T cells 
[14]. Moreover, the matching radiotracers required for NIS imag-
ing have already been translated to humans for thyroid imaging

[15, 16]. Together, these features render NIS a well-established 
host reporter gene suitable for preclinical long-term cell tracking 
and a candidate reporter for the clinical setting. 
Rendering Cell Therapies Traceable In Vivo
305
Genetic engineering of cells to introduce reporter genes into 
their genomes is most frequently performed using viral vectors 
(e.g., γ-retroviruses, lentiviruses), which integrate the transgenes 
into the genome without stringent positional control [17]. Lenti-
viruses are capable of efﬁciently transducing both actively dividing 
and non-dividing cell types, making them particularly valuable for 
stable gene transfer of mature somatic cells and lineage-committed, 
non-proliferating cells (i.e., differentiated from stem cells). In con-
trast, γ-retroviruses efﬁciently transduce only actively dividing cells. 
Both have been approved and are in commercial use in gene therapy 
applications for ex vivo modiﬁcation of T cells and hematopoietic 
stem cells [18]. Random genomic integration is associated with the 
risk of altering normal gene function at or around the integration 
site. Effects on the inserted reporter cannot be ruled out as well as 
epigenetic silencing. To mitigate this, episomal plasmids, which can 
also yield stable transgene expression, have been suggested 
[19, 20]. A recent development is gene editing, which offers a 
much more speciﬁc way of integrating the desired reporter gene 
at a distinct location into the genome of target cells [21, 22]. This is 
of utility in the context of stem cell therapies, where random 
integration of therapeutic, reporter, and suicide genes would pose 
risks of both insertional mutagenesis and downstream silencing. In 
fact, gene editing is emerging also clinically for a range of cell-
based therapies [23]. Nevertheless, γ-retrovirus- and lentivirus-
based technologies currently remain the state of the art for cell 
engineering as is evidenced by currently approved chimeric antigen 
receptor T cell therapies (CAR-T) [24]. Genetic engineering to 
implement additional payloads (e.g., reporter genes for imaging, 
suicide genes) into immune cell therapies such as CAR-Ts is less of a 
regulatory concern compared to genetic engineering of stem cell 
therapies, given that CAR expression is enabled by genetic engi-
neering and therefore a prerequisite for therapy efﬁcacy. In con-
trast, the clinical use of genetically modiﬁed stem cell therapies is 
not yet widespread [23, 25]. 
In this protocol, we describe how to use lentivirus-based engi-
neering to render different candidate cell therapies in vivo traceable 
by radionuclide imaging using NIS as a reporter. For preclinical 
experimentation only, we fused NIS with a ﬂuorescent protein to 
streamline cell line production and ex vivo downstream analyses [9– 
11, 13, 14, 26]. We detail the procedures involved using three cell 
therapy examples including human cardiac progenitor cells (CPC), 
effector T cells, and regulatory T cells.

Methods 
3.1 
Production of 
Lentivirus Particles for 
Engineering Cells to 
Express Reporter 
Genes 
1. Seed 293T cells (“virus producer cells”) at a density of 5 × 104 
cells/cm2 into tissue culture-treated plastic ﬂasks using the 
appropriate growth medium (cf. Materials). 
2. 24 h later, prepare for transfection. Therefore, bring all trans-
fection reagents to room temperature (RT) within a cell 
culture hood. 
3. Prepare the transfection mix under sterile conditions by dilut-
ing the combined amounts of required plasmid DNA into base 
DMEM in an Eppendorf tube (see Note 6). In the following, 
we describe the procedure for a second-generation lentivirus 
and on a ﬁnal production volume of ~2.5 mL using a 25 cm2 
cell culture ﬂask for production. Production can be scaled up or 
down for different culture vessels sizes. Mix 3.75 μg of the 
reporter gene plasmid pLNT SFFV>NIS-GFP or pLNT 
SFFV>NIS-RFP (see Note 7) with 2.81 μg of the packaging 
plasmid pCMV ΔR8.91 [27] and 0.94 μg of the envelope 
plasmid pCMV VSV-G and dilute this pre-mixed total amount 
of 7.5 μg plasmid DNA into 0.5 mL base DMEM. The relative 
mass ratio of plasmids is 4:3:1 in this case. 
4. Add the Polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent to the 
diluted DNA on a 3:1 mass ratio of PEI:total DNA. Here, 
add 22.5 μg PEI transfection reagent to the diluted plasmid 
mix from step 3. This solution is termed the “transfection 
mix.” The PEI is prepared by pre-dissolving it in endotoxin-
free water and heated to ~80 °C, neutralized to pH 7.0, sterile-
ﬁltered and stored at 4 °C, 
5. Incubate the transfection mix for 15 min at RT. 
6. Replace growth medium of the 293T cells; use 80 μL/cm2 , 
which amounts to 2 mL at the scale used here. 
7. Slowly add the transfection mix dropwise to the virus producer 
cells.

310
Ben Grimsdell et al.
8. After 18–24 h, inspect the virus producer cells using a tissue 
culture ﬂuorescence microscope (see Note 8). If ﬂuorescence 
signals are observed, discard cell supernatant and add fresh 
medium (into which transfected cells will continue to release 
virus particles). 
9. After a further 24 h, harvest the ﬁrst lentivirus-containing 
solution, i.e., the culture supernatant, and ﬁlter through a 
0.45 μM ﬁlter to remove any producer cells and large cell debris 
(see Note 9). Store the harvested virus particle solution at 4 °C. 
Add fresh medium to the cells for further virus production. 
10. After another 24 h, again harvest the lentivirus-containing 
supernatant, ﬁlter through a 0.45 μM ﬁlter, and combine it 
with the harvested lentivirus solution from the previous day. 
Destroy the virus producer cells by addition of bleach and 
discard after bleach action. 
11. Concentrate lentivirus particles if desired. Several methods can 
be used including commercial products (see Note 10). 
12. Optional virus concentration by sedimentation centrifugation 
(steps 12–14). Using an ultracentrifuge, spin the combined 
harvested virus batches at 50,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. 
13. Carefully decant the supernatant by inversion, let the tube dry 
for approximately 3 min at RT. Do not let completely dry the 
tube as the always remaining remnant (~10–15 μL) provides 
some proteins that are important for virus stabilization when 
subsequently resuspending the virus particles. 
14. Resuspend the viral pellet in the culture medium compatible 
with the cell type to be transduced. Therefore, add ﬁrst a small 
amount of resuspension solution (i.e., 15–20 μL desired cul-
ture medium) and pipet up and down about a dozen times. 
Avoid air bubble generation during this process as they reduce 
the available product volume and thus yield. 
15. Use lentiviral particles for transduction or store them in ali-
quots at -80 °C for future transduction experiments (see 
Notes 11 and 12). Virus titer determination is recommended 
using either a physical or functional titration approach [33]. 
3.2 
Transduction of 
Human Cardiac 
Progenitor Cells (CPC) 
1. Culture of CPCs requires specially pre-coated culture vessels. 
To prepare them add a 1:50 dilution of CELLstart in PBS and 
incubate the vessel in a humidiﬁed hypoxia incubator in an 
atmosphere containing 2% (v/v) O2 and 5% (v/v) CO2 at 
37 °C for 30–45 min. Prepare a 24-well plate in this manner. 
2. Remove coating mix and, without washing the 24-well plate, 
seed 2 × 105 CPCs per well (1 × 105 cells/cm2 ). 
3. Place 
plate 
back 
in 
a 
humidiﬁed 
hypoxia 
incubator 
(cf. atmosphere in step 1) and incubate for 18–24 h. 
4. Wash CPCs twice with PBS pre-warmed to 37 °C.

Rendering Cell Therapies Traceable In Vivo
311
5. Add either fresh or thawed lentivirus particle solution to the 
cells. To ensure optimal transduction, we recommend optimiz-
ing the MOI (starting range 1–5; see Note 13). 
6. Incubate the cells with lentivirus particles in a humidiﬁed hyp-
oxia incubator (cf. atmosphere in step 1) for 48 h. 
7. Remove supernatant and wash cells twice with fresh growth 
medium and add fresh growth media. 
8. Continue CPC culture until 70–80% conﬂuency is reached 
(as determined by user estimation employing brightﬁeld 
microscopy). 
9. Aspirate media and wash the cells twice with PBS. 
10. Add Accutase at 80 μL/cm2 and place ﬂask in the humidiﬁed 
hypoxia incubator for 3 min to lift CPCs. 
11. Neutralize the Accutase-containing CPC suspension by adding 
two additional volumes of CPC Passage medium, e.g., 4 mL of 
Passage medium to neutralize 2 mL of Accutase-containing cell 
suspension. 
12. Transfer the neutralized cell suspension into a Falcon tube and 
centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at RT. 
13. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the CPC cell pellet in 
growth medium and reseed cells at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 for 
transduction into a pre-coated culture ﬂask (cf. step 1). 
14. Continue to expand transduced CPC cells (steps 8–13) 
and/or start characterization (see Subheadings 3.5, 3.6, and 
3.7) depending on available cell amounts. Accompany culture 
with tissue culture ﬂuorescence microscopy to crudely assess 
transduction success based on NIS-GFP expression (use 
untransduced cells as controls). 
3.3 
Transduction of 
Human Regulatory T 
Cells 
Tregs grow in suspension and to transduce them culture vessels are 
used that were not pre-treated for tissue culture use but instead 
were pre-coated with retronectin. Here, transduction is performed 
in a 24-well format, but this can be scaled up or down as desired. 
The range of cells to be transduced in a 24-well format spans 
0.25 × 106 to 1 × 106 cells. 
1. To pre-coat the culture vessel with retronectin, completely 
cover each well with the retronectin working solution and 
incubate for 2 h at RT; for a 24-well, 200 μL is sufﬁcient (see 
Note 14). 
2. Aspirate the retronectin solution and carefully wash the well 
with 1 mL PBS. 
3. To prepare Tregs for transduction, collect them from their 
culture ﬂask into a 15 mL Falcon tube and count the cells 
using either an automated cell counter or a hematocytometer 
(see Note 15).

4. Take the aliquot for the desired cell number and transfer into a 
new Flacon tube and centrifuge at 350 × g for 10 min to pellet 
the cells. 
5. Wash the cells twice with PBS (spin at 350 × g for 10 min each 
time), resuspend at 5 × 106 cells/mL growth medium. 
6. Add the desired aliquots of lentivirus to each retronectin 
pre-coated well. To ensure optimal transduction, we recom-
mend optimizing the MOI (starting range 1–5). 
7. Incubate virus for 15 min at RT. 
8. Add the desired amount of Tregs to each well. Keep within the 
optimal range of 0.25–1 × 106 Tregs/24-well. 
9. Add IL-2 to a ﬁnal concentration of 1000 IU/mL. 
10. Perform “spin inoculation” by centrifuging the plate contain-
ing the 24-wells for at 600 × g for 1 h at 40 °C (see Note 16). 
11. Transfer plate in an incubator and leave in a humidiﬁed atmo-
sphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C for 48–72 h. 
12. Resuspend well contents and transfer into an Eppendorf tube 
and centrifuge at 350 × g for 10 min to collect cells. 
13. Wash cells twice in growth medium and resuspend for further 
culture. 
14. Expand the newly generated NIS-xFP+ Treg cells for further 
experiments including in vitro characterization (alongside 
untransduced Tregs as controls). Therefore, activate the cells 
with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (1:1 bead:cell ratio) in their nor-
mal growth medium (ensure both 1000 IU/mL IL-2 and 
100 nM rapamycin have been added), monitor cell numbers, 
and replace media as previously described [13, 30–32].

Transduction of 
Human Effector T Cells 
Teffs grow in suspension. To transduce them, culture vessels are 
used that were not pre-treated for tissue culture use but instead are 
pre-coated with retronectin. Here, transduction is performed in a 
6-well format, but this can be scaled up or down as desired. The 
number of cells to be transduced in a 6-well format is 106 cells. 
1. Activate fresh or cryopreserved primary human T cells by addi-
tion of anti CD3/CD28 magnetic beads at a ratio of 3:1 for 
beads:T cells in 6-well cell culture plates. Maintain T cells at a 
concentration of 106 T cells/mL during expansion. 
2. Pre-coat a different 6-well culture plate with retronectin. 
Therefore, completely cover each well with the retronectin 
working solution overnight, seal it using paraﬁlm, and store 
overnight at 4 °C  (see Note 17); for a 6-well, 1 mL is sufﬁcient 
to ensure surface area coverage.

3. On the day of the transduction, remove CD3/CD28 magnetic 
beads from the T cells by transferring them into a 15 mL Falcon 
tube and collecting the beads using a permanent magnet ﬁtting 
the tube between its poles (ﬁeld strength ~0.5 T between the 
poles). Gently collect the supernatant containing the T cells in a 
separate 15 mL Falcon tube and determine cell concentration 
(using an automated cell counter or hematocytometer). 
4. Take an aliquot amounting for the desired cell number, transfer 
it to a new Falcon tube, and pellet the cells (i.e., centrifuge at 
350 × g for 10 min). 
5. During centrifugation, aspirate retronectin solution from the 
pre-coated plate and carefully wash the well with 1 mL PBS. 
After that, leave 1 mL PBS in each well until use. 
6. Resuspend T cells and add the desired aliquot of lentivirus 
particles to the T cells. To ensure optimal transduction, we 
recommend optimizing the MOI, whereby values of 1–5 con-
stitute a good starting range. The optimal cell concentration is 
5 × 105 T cells per mL (with a total volume of 3 mL for the 
6-well scale described herein). 
7. Add IL-2 to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 IU/mL to the T cell 
suspension containing the lentivirus particles and resuspend 
(see Note 18). 
8. Add the mix from step 7 to the retronectin-coated and 
pre-washed 6-well plate from step 5. 
9. Perform “spin inoculation” by centrifuging the 6-well plate at 
300 × g for 1 h at RT. 
10. Transfer plate in the incubator and leave in a humidiﬁed atmo-
sphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. 
11. 48 h post-transduction, centrifuge the 6-well plate at 300 × g 
for 5 min and gently remove supernatant containing lentiviral 
particles. Wash the cells once with growth medium and spin 
again. 
12. Resuspend cells in fresh medium containing the appropriate 
cytokine (see Note 18) and transfer them into a tissue-culture 
ﬂask. Keep the cells at a concentration of 106 /mL. 
13. Culture the newly generated NIS-xFP+ T cells for further 
experiments including in vitro characterization (alongside 
untransduced T cells as controls; see Subheadings 3.5, 3.6, 
and 3.7). 
14. Optionally, T cells can also be cryopreserved (steps 14–19). 
Therefore, collect a representative aliquot of cells and remove 
any magnetic beads from stimulation steps. 
15. Make freezing medium containing base medium supplemented 
with 5% (v/v) DMSO, 6% pentastarch, and 4% (v/v) human 
serum albumin and cool to 4 °C until use (see Note 19).

16. Centrifuge T cells at 300 × g for 5 min, discard the supernatant. 
17. Wash T cells once with 5 mL PBS followed by centrifugation 
(300 × g for 5 min) and discard supernatant. 
18. Resuspend pellet in 1 mL of cold freezing medium. 
19. Freeze T cells in a freezing container offering controlled-tem-
perature cooling and store at -80 °C for 48 h and then transfer 
the frozen cells into liquid nitrogen for storage .

Determination of 
NIS-Fluorescent 
Protein Reporter 
Expression in 
Transduced Cells 
The expression of NIS-xFP can be directly assessed by ﬂuorescence 
methodology. While reporter expression in adherent cells is readily 
accessible by ﬂuorescence microscopy of cells in their culture ves-
sels, and this is sufﬁcient for the conﬁrmation of transduction 
success, we recommend using analytical ﬂow cytometry to obtain 
quantitative reporter expression data. The xFP offers a directly 
detectable marker for quantiﬁcation of the percentage of positively 
transduced cells and, if desired, for preparative isolation of trans-
duced cells using ﬂuorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) technol-
ogy. Here, we describe basic reporter expression analysis in live cells 
by analytical ﬂow cytometry (see Notes 20 and 21). 
1. To analyze reporter-transduced CPCs, lift and pellet aliquots of 
1–2 × 105 cells as described in Subheading 3.2 (Subheading 
3.2, steps 9–12). Resuspend cells in 500 μL PBS containing 2% 
(v/v) Stemulate serum and transfer to a round-bottom ﬂow 
cytometry tube. 
2. To analyze reporter-transduced Tregs or Teffs, count cell sus-
pensions and take aliquots of 1–2 × 105 cells, wash with PBS, 
resuspend in 500 μL PBS containing 2% (v/v) BSA, and transfer 
to a round-bottom ﬂow cytometry tube. 
3. Always prepare in the same way as described in step 1 untrans-
duced cells (best to use parental cells that were grown alongside 
the transduced ones), which serve as negative controls for 
determining the ﬂow cytometer settings. If available, also use 
positive control cells, e.g., the same cell type or similar cells 
transduced with the same construct or a construct that also 
offers expression of the same xFP. 
4. Use a ﬂow cytometer suitable for the chosen reporter ﬂuoro-
phore and acquire FSC, SSC, and xFP channel data. Analyze by 
gating on intact cells using FSC/SSC and produce xFP channel 
histograms as shown in Fig. 1 for NIS-GFP+ CPCs, in Fig. 2 for 
NIS-RFP+ Tregs, and in Fig. 3 for or NIS-RFP+ Teffs. Quanti-
tative analysis comparing untransduced and transduced cells 
reveals the percentage of transduced cells.

competitive co-substrate and when present reduced radiotracer uptake, thereby demonstrating radiotracer 
uptake to speciﬁc to NIS-GFP expression in cells. Radioactivity in fractions was determined by gamma 
counting of fractions. (Bottom) From directly quantiﬁed assay fractions in the top panel, the cellular

Determination of 
Reporter Localization 
in Transduced Cells 
The plasma membrane localization of NIS-xFP fusion reporters is 
crucial for reporter function (see Note 22) and can be directly 
observed by counterstaining the plasma membrane with suitable 
agents. Here, we describe the staining of NIS-GFP+ CPC plasma 
membranes with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to the 
AlexaFluor 633 dye and thereby demonstrating NIS-GFP plasma 
membrane localization. The same protocol can be used for suspen-
sion cells such as Tregs or Teffs after they have been attached to the 
glass surface of a coverslip (e.g., using either poly-L-lysine or 
retronectin-coated glass coverslips or cytocentrifugation [34]). 
1. Prepare cover glasses to subsequently seed cells onto them: 
Incubate cover glasses in 40% (v/v) conc. HCl with 60% 
(v/v) EtOH for 2 h using a porcelain/glass petri dish. Then 
wash twice with 70% (v/v) ethanol solution, wash twice with 
methanol, wash once with acetone (all at RT), and let cover 
glasses dry on ﬁlter paper. Place cover glasses into a glass petri 
dish containing one layer of ﬁlter paper and autoclave the vessel 
to sterilize it. Subsequently, open only under sterile conditions 
using sterile forceps to handle cover glasses. 
2. Pre-coat sterile cover glasses with poly-L-lysine. Therefore, add 
one cover glass into a well of a 24-well or 4-well plate and 
250 μL poly-L-lysine stock solution; close plate and leave for 
15 min at room temperature, then wash thrice with sterile 
water and let dry within the tissue culture hood. 
3. Seed NIS-GFP+ CPCs and untransduced CPCs, respectively, 
onto sterile poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 
0.15 × 105 cells/cm2 (see CPC culture in Subheading 3.2, steps 
8–13). For Tregs and Teffs, seed 3 × 104 cells/cm2 on CELL-
Start pre-coated glass coverslips. 
4. After 24 h, aspirate the media and carefully wash the cells twice 
with 500 μL PBS (see Note 23). 
5. Add 500 μL 4% paraformaldehyde solution and incubate for 
10 min at RT (see Note 24). 
6. Aspirate ﬁxative and wash cells twice with PBS (see Note 23). 
7. Add 200 μL of WGA-633 working solution (2 μg/mL in PBS) 
and incubate for 10 min at RT in the dark. 
8. Wash cells twice with PBS (leave PBS on cells for ~5 min per 
wash step). 
Fig. 2 (continued) ﬂow cytometry: Cells were stained with antibodies speciﬁc to CD127, CD4, CD25, and 
Foxp3 to identify Tregs, which were then analyzed for RFP expression. Human Tregs are generally deﬁned as 
CD4+ CD25+ CD127low FoxP3+ cells and data reveal not only that transduced and sorted NIS-RFP+ Tregs are 
>99% positive for the reporter after puriﬁcation and expansion for 10 days, but also that their phenotype is 
unchanged to untransduced Tregs.

9. Add 200 μL Hoechst 33342 working solution (4 μg/mL in 
PBS) as a nuclear counterstain (see Note 25) and incubate for 
10 min at RT in the dark. 
10. Wash cells twice with PBS (leave PBS on cells for ~5 min per 
wash step). 
11. Rinse cells twice with deionized water (leave water on cells for 
~5 min per wash step) and then ﬁll the well with 1 mL deio-
nized water (see Note 26). 
12. Pipette 12 μL CFM-3 mounting solution onto microscope 
slides. 
13. Use pointed forceps to carefully remove cover glasses from the 
wells (see Note 27), dip them carefully with a corner onto ﬁlter 
paper to suck off most of the water, and then mount them with 
the cells facing the microscope slide by placing them on top of 
the CFM-3 drop prepared in step 12. 
14. Leave the samples to dry for 24 h at RT in the dark. Samples 
can be stored for days at RT or for months at -20 °C. 
15. Image samples using a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope 
equipped with lasers and ﬁlters appropriate for the chosen 
ﬂuorophores. Here, we used one equipped to image DAPI/ 
Hoechst 33342, FITC/GFP, and Cy5/AlexaFluor633 in the 
case of CPCs (Fig. 1b) and DAPI/Hoechst 33342, FITC/ 
AlexaFluor488, and Cy3/TagRFP in the case of Teffs 
(Fig. 3b). 
3.7 
Reporter 
Function 
Functional considerations of NIS-xFP reporters include both 
NIS-substrate transport and ﬂuorescence properties. Assessment 
of ﬂuorescence properties has been described above and serves as 
a prerequisite for the subsequent use of radioisotopes to determine 
NIS transport activity (see Note 28). Here, we describe the deter-
mination of NIS function through its uptake of the radiotracer 
[99m Tc]TcO4
-, which is a generator-produced and readily available 
radiotracer. We describe it for adherent CPC (steps 1–10) as well as 
for suspension cells using Teffs (steps 11–20) as an example; the 
handling steps for Tregs would be identical. 
1. For adherent cells (here CPCs): Seed 2 × 105 puriﬁed 
NIS-GFP+ CPCs 
cells 
in 12-well plates 
(pre-coated 
as 
described in Subheading 3.2, steps 1 and 2) 1 day prior to 
the experiment. Prepare all samples in triplicate and include 
control samples: “speciﬁcity controls,” i.e., NIS-GFP expres-
sing CPCs that will be pre-incubated with a competitive NIS 
substrate to test uptake speciﬁcity, and “untransduced cell 
controls,” i.e., parental CPCs that will receive the radiotracer 
substrate to determine potential basal cell-intrinsic uptake (see 
Note 29).

2. On the next morning, wash cells twice with serum-free growth 
medium. 
3. For speciﬁcity controls, pre-incubate the cells for 20 min with 
12.5 μM of the competitive substrate NaClO4
-. Keep the 
competitive substrate concentration constant throughout the 
experiment in all subsequent incubation steps involving these 
controls. 
4. Incubate cells in serum-free growth medium in the presence of 
1 mL of 50 kBq/mL [99m Tc]TcO4
- for 30 min in the cell 
culture incubator as for normal cell culture. 
5. Collect the supernatant and transfer 100 μL of it to a prepared 
collection tube labeled “Supernatant” (see Note 30). 
6. Wash the cells twice with 1 mL ice-cold PBSCaMg . Collect each 
wash solution and transfer 100 μL of each into a prepared 
collection tube labeled “Wash 1” or “Wash 2,” respectively 
(see Note 31). 
7. Lift the cells by adding 500 μL accutase to each sample, incu-
bate for 3 min in the cell incubator, check cell detachment, and 
collect the cell suspension in a tube labeled “Cells.” Wash the 
wells with 500 μL ice-cold PBSCaMg to collect remaining cells 
and add to the tube “Cells.” Pellet the cells by centrifugation 
(250 × g, 4 min). In some cases, re-seeding of the radiolabeled 
cells might be desired (see Note 32). 
8. Measure the counts per minute (CPM) of all four tubes per 
samples using a γ-counter set to the energy window of the 
chosen radiotracer (i.e., 99m Tc (140.5 KeV)). 
9. Analyze data by summing obtained γ-counts in CPM from each 
well to determine a total radioactivity count per well. Take 
aliquoting in steps 5 and 6 into account by multiplying num-
bers by a factor of 10 for “Supernatant,” “Wash 1,” and “Wash 
2” tubes. 
10. Express the cellular radiotracer uptake as %Uptake as indicated 
in Eq. 1. Calculate averages and standard deviations from 
triplicate experiments. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1c.

16. Wash the cells twice with 1000 μL ice-cold PBSCaMg followed 
by a centrifuging step each (300 × g, 5 min). Collect each wash 
solution and transfer 100 μL of each into a prepared collection 
tube labeled “Wash 1” or “Wash 2,” respectively (see Note 31). 
17. Label the Eppendorf tube containing the cell pellet “Cells” and 
resuspend T cells in their growth medium. In some cases, 
re-seeding of the radiolabeled cells might be desired (see 
Note 32). 
18. Measure the CPM of all four tubes per samples using a gamma 
counter set to the energy window of the chosen radiotracer 
(i.e., 99m Tc (140.5 KeV)).

determine a total radioactivity count per well. Take aliquoting 
in steps 15 and 16 into account by multiplying numbers by a 
factor of 10 for “Supernatant,” “Wash 1,” and “Wash 2” tubes. 
20. Express the cellular radiotracer uptake as %Uptake as indicated 
in Eq. (1). Calculate averages and standard deviations from 
triplicate experiments. Typical results for Tregs and Teffs are 
shown in Figs. 2c and 3c, respectively.

Notes 
1. All solutions that encounter living cells must be sterilized or 
purchased sterile and kept sterile. All handling of cells must be 
done in a suitable cell culture hood with appropriate personal 
protection equipment. Primary human cells need to be handled 
according to biosafety class 2 regulations. All items that 
encounter live lentivirus particles must be disinfected using 
bleach. 
2. As virus producer cells, we use the HEK 293T cell line, origi-
nally referred as 293tsA1609neo, which is a highly transfect-
able derivative of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and

contains the SV40 T-antigen. It gives high titers when used to 
produce retroviruses. It has been widely used for retroviral 
production, gene expression, and protein production. These 
cells can be grown in the presence of 100 IU penicillin/strep-
tomycin (PenStrep) if desired. Subcultivation ratios range from 
1:3 to 1:8 and 0.05% (w/v). Trypsin containing 0.53 mM 
EDTA can be used. 
3. Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium F-12 Ham supplemen-
ted with 10% ESQ; 1% PenStrep can be added if desired. This 
medium is used as a quenching solution to the lifting agent, 
containing Accutase, during CPC cell culture. 
4. Non-tissue culture plates must be used as tissue culture-treated 
plates would give lower transduction efﬁciencies and lower 
recovery of Tregs from the plates. 
5. Similarly, WGA conjugated to other ﬂuorophores can be used 
as long as the organic dye does not impede observation of the 
ﬂuorescent protein. 
6. The total amount of plasmid DNA consists of a mixture of 
various DNA plasmids that together encode all parts necessary 
to form the virus and the reporter gene transfer vector. This 
includes the reporter gene encoding plasmid, second- or 
third-generation lentiviral packaging plasmids, and a plasmid 
encoding the desired virus envelope. Depending on the precise 
lentivirus to be produced, the plasmids used for its production 
vary and consequently also the relative mass ratios as the plas-
mid sizes differ. For example, the second-generation lentivirus 
system in our example above uses the mass ratio 4:3:1 for the 
reporter gene encoding plasmid, the required packaging plas-
mid, and the envelope plasmid, respectively. A different non-
commercial third-generation lentivirus system employs the two 
packaging plasmids pMDL g/p RRE (Addgene #12251) and 
pRSV-Rev (Addgene #12253) and pMD2.G as an envelope 
plasmid (Addgene #12259) encoding for VSV-G. The ratio 
of these plasmids (assuming the target plasmid is similar in 
size to our reporter gene plasmid) is 4:2:2:1.To alter the lenti-
virus tropism, the VSV-G encoding envelop plasmid can be 
replaced by others that result in the lentiviral particles to be 
pseudotyped as desired [35]. 
7. The plasmids referred to here as pLNT SFFV>NIS-GFP or 
pLNT SFFV>NIS-RFP both encode for the radionuclide 
reporter NIS which is fused on its C-terminus to a ﬂuorescent 
protein [9, 10]. In both reporter plasmids, monomeric variants 
of the ﬂuorescent proteins are used such as the GFP mutant 
mEGFP A206K [36, 37] or mTagRFP [38], which are used in 
the NIS-GFP and NIS-RFP reporters, respectively, in this pro-
tocol. This is important to avoid artiﬁcial clustering of the 
plasma membrane-localized radionuclide reporter NIS.

8. Fluorescence signals from the NIS-GFP or NIS-RFP reporters 
can be seen in producer cells and are indicative of successful 
reporter gene transfection. But it is important to appreciate 
that they are only a surrogate for successful co-transfection and 
not an indicator of successful virus production (e.g., they 
would also be observed if reporter gene plasmids were wrongly 
transfected without any other relevant components for virus 
production). If there are no ﬂuorescence signals detected, 
either there is a problem with the reporter plasmid or transfec-
tion failed and the experiment should be terminated and 
re-started. 
9. The ﬁlter used in this step is not the conventional 0.22 μm 
sterile ﬁltration device. While lentiviruses are in the range of 
80–100 nm in diameter, it is safer to use a ﬁlter pore size of 
0.45 μm to ensure virus particles are not damaged. Virus 
aggregation plays a minor role at this stage but can become 
relevant at high virus particle concentrations (~108 TU/mL) 
and presents a major downstream processing caveat for indus-
trial virus manufacturing. 
10. Lentiviral particles can be concentrated either by ultracentrifu-
gation or by using commercial kits involving proprietary mate-
rials and intended to avoid long-term centrifugation. An 
example of the latter and which we have successfully used in 
the 
past 
are 
Speedy 
Lentivirus 
Puriﬁcation 
(Abmgood, 
#LV999), 
Lentivirus 
Concentration 
Solution 
(Origene, 
#TR30025), and Lenti-X™ Maxi puriﬁcation kit (Takara, 
#631234). As for ultracentrifugation, the standard protocol 
involves sedimentation centrifugation. Alternatively, centrifu-
gation in a 10% sucrose gradient with a relatively low speed 
(≤10,000 × g) has also been shown to result high-titer virus 
preparation (up to 2 × 108 TU/mL) [39]. 
11. The viral supernatant can be stored at 4 °C for around 2 days 
without signiﬁcant losses in titer but should be aliquoted and 
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70/-80 °C as  
soon as if longer storage is required. 
12. Consideration of practical aliquot sizes is paramount as lentivi-
rus titers decrease about twofold with each freeze-thaw cycle. 
Virus titer determination via standard methods is recom-
mended when larger virus batches are produced intended for 
several or comparative transductions and is required when the 
multiplicity of infection is of importance for experimental 
success. 
13. MOI is an important aspect in viral transduction (infection) of 
cells. In this context, it is the ratio of infecting agents (i.e., virus 
particles) to susceptible targets (i.e., target cells). A MOI of 
one means that on an average there is one virus particle for one

324
Ben Grimsdell et al.
target cell. However, multiple virus particles can infect a single 
target cell, while some of the target cells might remain unaf-
fected. The infection of a target cell is a chance event and can be 
described by the Poisson distribution. At a set MOI, the prob-
ability of a target cell to be infected by ν virus particles is given 
by Eq. 2: 
P ν
ð Þ = MOIνe - MOI 
ν!
ð2Þ 
For example, at an MOI of 1, the probability that a target 
cell will not get infected is P(ν = 0) = 36.8% and the probabil-
ity that it will be infected by a single particle is also 
P(ν = 1) = 36.8%, while the probabilities that a target cell is 
infected by two or three virus particles are P(ν = 2) = 18.4% 
and P(ν = 3) = 6.13%, respectively. Cumulatively viewed, the 
probability that a target cell is infected by at least one virus 
particle is P(ν > 0) = 63.2%. If the MOI is increased to 3 or 
5, P(ν > 0) increases to 95.0% and 99.3%, respectively. It is 
important to remember that the MOI is also affected by virus’ 
abilities to infect target cells (cf. tropism), the attachment to 
the target cells, how much time is allowed for attachment, and 
also the target cell status (e.g., lentiviruses infecting resting and 
growing cells, while several retroviruses can only infect grow-
ing cells). Hence, it is also recommended to observe actually 
achieved transduction efﬁciencies (e.g. here by ﬂow cytometry 
based on NIS-xFP expression) as a function of input MOIs. 
These relationships vary between the different cell types used in 
this protocol. 
14. Retronectin coating of plates may be performed overnight, 
whereby it must be ensured that the solution does not dry 
out in the well. Coated plates can be sealed using paraﬁlm 
and stored at 4 °C for up to a week. 
15. Prior to transduction, Tregs may or may not be stimulated. 
Better results may be achieved if they have been stimulated 
2–3 days prior to transduction. If stimulation is performed 
using CD3/CD28 beads, it is not necessary to remove beads 
before transduction. 
16. Centrifuge speed may be increased to up to 1000 × g using 
compatible cell culture plates to improve transduction efﬁ-
ciency. Risk of producing aerosols increases at higher speeds 
and Treg viability may be negatively affected. 
17. Retronectin-coated plates can be stored at 4 °C for up to one 
week. The paraﬁlm sealing will prevent evaporation while 
maintaining sterility. 
18. IL-2 is used in the initial phase of T cell expansion and can be 
replaced by IL-15 three days after transduction. This has been

325
reported to preserve a less-differentiated stem cell memory 
phenotype, result in less expression of exhaustion markers, 
and improve anti-tumor activity [40–42]. Notably, selective 
expansion strategies have also been reported. For example, 
one based on a co-transduced IL-4Rα—IL-2/15Rβ chimera 
permitting the use of IL-4 to transmit an IL-2/15-like signal in 
the absence of either IL-2 or IL-15, thereby selectively expand-
ing transduced cells only by administration of IL-4 [43]. The 
latter strategy has recently been used in combination with a 
NIS-RFP reporter to produce traceable T cells [14]. 
19. Alternatively, freezing media without animal products are com-
mercially available. Notably, freezing media containing 10% 
DMSO results in lower T cell recovery rates upon thawing. 
20. Characterization 
of 
reporter 
gene-engineered 
cells 
must 
include the validation of the reporters. Importantly, validation 
must also entail other cellular aspects to ensure the genetic 
engineering did not impair other relevant cellular behaviors 
and functions. This can mean a large variety of experiments 
are required to compare untransduced and reporter-expressing 
cells [4, 10, 11, 13, 14]. Here, we describe only the experi-
ments necessary to validate reporter function, as others are cell 
type-dependent and application-speciﬁc. Typical results for 
CPC, Treg, and Teff cells are depicted for each cell type in 
Figs. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
21. As an alternative to live cell-based ﬂow cytometry, cells can be 
ﬁxed and stained with DNA dyes (to discriminate intact cell 
from dead cells or debris). If required by experimental sched-
uling, this approach can also introduce a “breaking point” as 
ﬁxed cells could be kept refrigerated for a few days prior to 
staining and analysis by ﬂow cytometry. 
22. NIS is a transport protein and only functional if correctly 
inserted into the plasma membrane of a cell. NIS is normally 
expressed in thyroid follicular cells and cells of the stomach 
lining and at much lower levels in salivary glands, lactating 
mammary glands, and testes [44]. While this makes it an 
excellent host reporter gene for PET and SPECT imaging 
[4], it also means that it is not normally expressed in the cells 
one wishes to track. While NIS has been shown to be sensitive 
to N-terminal modiﬁcation [14], it is permissive to C-terminal 
modiﬁcation with xFP [9, 10] enabling NIS-xFP fusion pro-
teins to be used for preclinical research. Consequently, it is 
necessary to assess its correct localization in transduced cells 
to conﬁrm localization to the plasma membrane in the cells of 
interest.

23. Relative to other cell types, these cells can easily detach from 
the surface of the coverslip, hence add the PBS slowly via the 
wall of the well to reduce the shear force on the cells. 
24. The ﬁxation time varies depending on the cell type, usually ﬁx 
between 7 and 15 min. Do not use any ﬁxative that contains 
permeabilizing agents (e.g., Triton X-100) as the aim here is to 
leave the plasma membrane intact. This also means that “over-
ﬁxing” should be avoided (e.g., excessive paraformaldehyde 
ﬁxation can lead to pores in cells). WGA bind to glycosylated 
proteins and should not gain entry into cells as it would stain, 
for example, the Golgi apparatus to a heavy extent, thereby 
WGA-633 signals would no longer be exclusive to the plasma 
membranes and results become difﬁcult to interpret. We rec-
ommend optimizing ﬁxatives and ﬁxing conditions before 
experimentation with new or different cell types. 
25. Any nuclear stain that is not interfering in its ﬂuorophore 
properties with both the used reporter ﬂuorophore and 
WGA-633 can be used. 
26. To reduce background, we recommend observing the timings 
during the washing steps. 
27. Removing the cover glasses from the wells represents a delicate 
handling step. Using ﬁlled wells to remove the cover glasses 
reduces the force necessary to do so and thereby the likelihood 
to break the thin cover glasses. We also recommend using a 
“customized” pair of pointed forceps in which one tip is short-
ened by ~2 mm and the second bent toward the other tip. 
28. NIS is very selective in cation transport and requires the cellular 
Na+ /K+ gradient to be intact to function. In contrast, it is very 
unselective in anion transport, which has been exploited for 
nuclear medicine and cell tracking applications. There are sev-
eral anions that can be transported by NIS [26, 44, 45] and 
consequently could be used for radioactive uptake assays; prac-
tical radioactive substrates include the iodide isotopes 123 I-, 
124 I-, 125 I-, and 131 I-, and the tetrahedral pertechnetate ana-
logs 188 ReO4
- and [18 F]BF4
-. When choosing a radiotracer, 
several properties must be considered, including a practical 
half-life, compatibility of the emitted radiation energy with 
the available detection instrumentation, potential radiodamage 
to the cells if they were to be kept for longer, radiotracer cost, 
radiotracer 
disposal, 
and 
available 
personal 
protection 
equipment. 
29. For fast growing cells, it is necessary to seed an extra number of 
wells (not to be incubated with the radiotracer), harvest, and 
count cells to obtain a reading for the actual number of cells in 
the seeded wells at the time of the radiotracer uptake 
experiment.

30. Due to the large number of samples each requiring several 
collection tubes, it is highly recommended to pre-label all 
tubes before the start of the experiment, and to use an auto-
mated gamma counter capable of automatic decay correction. 
31. Two wash steps are usually sufﬁcient; however, if the media 
supernatant cannot be efﬁciently removed without disturbing 
the cell pellet, an extra wash step can be performed. 
32. Re-seeding of radiolabeled cells might be required to study 
radiotracer efﬂux as well as radiodamage overtime. Therefore, 
it is recommended to perform the gamma counting as fast as 
possible to reduce the time cells experience suboptimal condi-
tions by being outside of the incubator. It is also recommended 
to note all relevant absolute times (radiotracer administration 
and time of cell pellet resuspension prior to gamma counting as 
the beginning of a potential efﬂux experiment, etc.).

Single-Cell PET Imaging and Tracking 
Kyung Oh. Jung and Guillem Pratx 
Abstract 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most sensitive whole-body molecular imaging techni-
ques available in the clinic, able to detect picomolar levels of probe. As such, it was recently demonstrated 
that PET could also be used to track single radiolabeled cells in small animals. In this protocol, we present 
detailed procedures for radiolabeling cells using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and for tracking 
these cells in real time using in vivo PET. This includes static imaging of single cells as well as dynamic 
tracking of moving cells directly from the list-mode data. The protocol provides detailed instructions and 
examples for each step.

Introduction 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is the only in vivo imaging 
modality capable of detecting picomolar levels of probe at the 
whole-body level in humans [1, 2]. Previously, we demonstrated 
that this high sensitivity could be harnessed to image and track 
single cells in small-animal models. To achieve this goal, we devel-
oped and tested a novel trajectory reconstruction algorithm that 
uses the list-mode data produced by the scanner to localize single 
moving sources (such as cells) in 3D and in real time [3, 4]. 
To translate this concept for in vivo applications, we then 
investigated and optimized a method for labeling cells with 
>20 Bq per cell, which is the minimum amount of radioactivity 
required for accurate tracking. This amount of radioactivity can 
vary based on several factors. The best tracking performance will 
be achieved for scanners with high coincidence detection sensitivity 
(7–14% for preclinical scanners) and low intrinsic background. In 
addition, due to the very low activity, it is also critical to minimize

background contamination within the room (including any radio-
activity stored near the scanner or radioactivity on the scanner bed 
from a previous experiment). Finally, fast moving cells are more 
challenging to track and typically require a higher count rate for 
accurate tracking. A basic rule of thumb [3] is that a tracked cell 
should be labeled with an amount of radioactivity (in Bq) equal to 
at least four times its velocity (in mm/s). This is equivalent to say 
that a tracked cell should emit, on average, four positrons for every 
1 mm travelled.

To achieve such high radioactivity per cell, our method uses 
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), a type of nanomaterial 
that has received considerable attention due to its high surface 
area and large pore volume [5]. The properties of MSNs make 
them well suited for carrying speciﬁc cargo efﬁciently into single 
cells [6]. An additional property of these nanoparticles is that 
radiometals such as 68 Ga and 89 Zr naturally form complexes with 
their silica surface, which provides a straightforward method for 
radiolabeling MSNs with upwards of 0.5 Bq per single nanoparti-
cle. Cells are then labeled through passive incubation with the 
treated MSNs. Given the high radioactivity per nanoparticles, 
only ~100 nanoparticles are needed to label cells with sufﬁcient 
radioactivity for this protocol. Following that, single cells are 
isolated and administered through an intravenous (IV) catheter 
into live individuals. Gamma rays emitted from the single cells are 
captured by a PET scanner and processed by a special-purpose 
reconstruction algorithm to estimate, in real time, the location of 
the moving cell. 
Single-cell tracking using PET may have a number of applica-
tions. For instance, we are interested in applying this technique to 
understand the migration of immunotherapeutic cells in cancer 
patients. Being able to identify the migration routes and kinetics 
of therapeutic cells would enable more efﬁcient delivery of these 
precious cells toward the solid tumors they are intended to treat. 
Highly sensitive PET scanners with long axial ﬁeld of view are being 
developed that could be used to sensitively detect the dim signals 
emanating from single cells [7]. In addition, in the preclinical 
setting, the approach could be useful to better understand the 
early stage of metastasis, a stage during which cells shed by the 
tumor circulate in the blood before arresting in a remote organ. 
Finally, research is ongoing to improve the throughput of the 
method and enable tracking of multiple cells in parallel in the 
same individual. This protocol provides a detailed description of 
the techniques employed for labeling nanoparticles with radioiso-
tope, isolating highly radioactive single cells, and tracking these 
cells in real time and in vivo using PET (Fig. 1).

Methods 
3.1 
Radiolabeling of 
MSNs 
1. One day before experiment, activate MSNs by overnight incu-
bation in ethanol. 
2. All personnel working with radioactive materials should wear 
proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and personal 
dosimeters (body and ring). 
3. Add 4.5 μg of MSNs to 1.5 mL tube containing, for 68 Ga, 
100 μL of MES buffer or, for 89 Zr, 1 mL of HEPES buffer. 
4. Label the MSNs with 68 Ga by adding 1.5 mL of 68 GaCl3 
solution (~600 MBq) eluted with HCl from a clinical-grade 
generator or with 89 Zr by adding 89 Zr oxalic acid (93 MBq in 
100 μL). 
5. For 68 Ga, set reaction pH to ~7.3 by adding 30 μL of ammo-
nium hydroxide solution and then incubate mixture at 75 °C 
for 15 min (see Note 2). Alternatively, for 89 Zr, add Na2CO3 
solution to achieve pH of 8–9 and then incubate mixture at 
75 °C for 2 h (see Note 3). 
6. Wash the nanoparticles three times with PBS by centrifugation 
at 16,000 × g for 1 min to remove any residual radioisotope. 
7. To validate radiolabeling purity, deposit 1.5 μL of the radiola-
beled MSNs onto silica-gel impregnated iTLC-SG paper. Use 
EDTA as the elution solvent, and analyze the samples using 
radio-iTLC. 
3.2 
Lipid Coating of 
MSN 
1. To coat MSN with a lipid bilayer (see Note 4), prepare two 
separate solutions: one containing a mixture of 4.5 μg of MSNs 
in 500 μL of Opti-MEM and the other containing a mixture of 
20 μL of Lipofectamine diluted in 500 μL of Opti-MEM. 
2. Incubate the two mixtures for 5 min at room temperature.

Single-Cell PET Imaging and Tracking
335
3. Combine the two solutions and incubate for an additional 
15 min at room temperature. 
4. Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 min to isolate the coated MSNs. 
3.3 
In Vitro Cell 
Uptake and 
Radioactivity 
Measurements 
1. Culture MDA-MB-231 cells (human invasive ductal carci-
noma) in cell culture media. Follow standard culture protocol. 
2. Seed MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates 
and incubate in a CO2 incubator for 24 h at 37 °C. 
3. Add lipid-coated 
68 Ga/89 Zr-MSNs in 3 mL cell culture 
medium and incubate for 40 min at 37 °C. 
4. Rinse the cells three times with 1 mL PBS to remove 
residual MSNs. 
5. Optionally, incubate the cells with a nuclear ﬂuorescent stain 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then wash the 
cells three times by pipetting 1 mL PBS. 
6. Prepare a suspension of MDA-MB-231 cells and manually 
dispense the cells into Terasaki plates [8]. The cell concentra-
tion should be adjusted to achieve about 1 cell per 10 μL well 
on average (about 100 cells per mL). Due to Poisson statistics, 
the number of cells per well will ﬂuctuate from 0 to more 
than 1. 
7. Use ﬂuorescence microscopy to count the number of cells per 
well. Identify wells containing various numbers of cells and 
transfer their contents to a 96-well plate for PET imaging 
(Inveon D-PET, 425–650 keV energy window, 10 min acqui-
sition time). Assess the sensitivity of the imaging setup by 
visualizing the reconstructed images for different numbers of 
cells and performing region of interest analysis using the imag-
ing software. 
8. Alternatively, measure the radioactivity of different numbers of 
cells using gamma counting (counting time of 30–60 s per 
sample; see Note 5). 
3.4 
Static In Vivo Cell 
Imaging Using PET/CT 
1. Static imaging of single cells in mice assumes that the cells are 
immobile over the duration of the scan. Cell motion will result 
in incorrect reconstruction of the tracer distribution. This 
method can be used to reconstruct either a single cell or a 
small number of cells in the same individual. 
2. All animal experiments should be conducted under oversight 
from an institutional animal use panel. 
3. Screen single cells from Terasaki plates and select those with 
higher count rate (see Note 6). It is important to note that 
MSN uptake can be heterogeneous; thus, preselecting cells on 
the basis of uptake will increase the likelihood of success. This

336
Kyung Oh. Jung and Guillem Pratx
can be done by pipetting a single cell and then placing the pipet 
tip next to the survey meter set to 1X setting. Geiger–Mueller 
detectors are sensitive enough to respond to the radioactivity of 
single cells loaded with >20 Bq. 
4. Load a small number of cells (1–100) into a syringe (100 μL of  
the injection volume). 
5. Anesthetize the mouse using 1–2% isoﬂurane concentration 
and 0.5 L/min oxygen ﬂow rate. 
6. Inject the cell(s) through desired route of administration 
(intravenous, etc.). 
7. At the desired time point, place the mouse in the scanner, 
resume gas anesthesia administration, and run a static PET 
acquisition. The optimal time point will be based on the appli-
cation, the question of interest, and the half-life of the radio-
nuclide. Imaging can be performed as soon as the cells have 
been administered or at later time points to provide informa-
tion regarding the dissemination of cells at different time 
points. It is important to pay attention to the energy window 
to minimize the contribution of intrinsic scintillator back-
ground to the measured signal. For the Inveon PET/CT, an 
energy window of 425–650 keV and an acquisition of 10 min 
yield suitable sensitivity for single cells (see Note 7). Other 
scanners may have different optimal settings. Optionally, a 
normalization scan can be performed with the modiﬁed energy 
window to obtain quantitative images in units of kB/cc. If the 
normalization step is not performed, only relative activity mea-
surements can be obtained, which is suitable for localizing 
single cells but not for assessing their radioactivity in vivo. 
Normalization is a standard procedure performed once a 
month on most scanners; it requires placing a standard phan-
tom in the bore of the scanner and running a long acquisition 
overnight. 
8. After PET imaging, acquire X-ray CT images with standard 
settings (80 kVp, 500 μA). Alternatively, an anatomical refer-
ence can be obtained by acquiring a transmission scan, accord-
ing to the ability of the scanner. Either set of images can be 
used for attenuation and scatter correction. 
9. Reconstruct static PET images using the standard algorithm 
that is available on the scanner, such as OSEM or similar itera-
tive algorithm. A typical example of images reconstructed with 
this method is shown in Fig. 2. 
10. For cells labeled with long-lived 89 Zr-MSNs, multiple time 
points can be acquired for longitudinal imaging up to 48 h 
(see Note 8).

Single-Cell PET Imaging and Tracking
337
Fig. 2 PET tracking of single IV-injected cell. (a) A radiolabeled single MDA-MB-231 cell (22 Bq) was injected 
IV, and then a PET scan was acquired using PET/CT (425-50 keV energy window, 10 min acquisition, 2 min 
postinjection). Conventional reconstruction (2D-OSEM) shows focal uptake in the lung area, a likely site of 
arrest for cancer cells. The noise in the PET image is due to the low radioactivity of the cell (22 Bq), which is 
barely above the detection threshold (20 Bq). (b) The list-mode data was processed using a dynamic trajectory 
reconstruction algorithm. The result shows that the cell remains essentially at the same position during the 
10-min-long scan 
3.5 
Dynamic Cell 
Tracking Using PET/CT 
1. Dynamic tracking follows in real time the motion of moving 
cells. In its present implementation, dynamic tracking can only 
be applied to a single injected cell. 
2. For dynamic tracking in mice, the cell should be injected into 
the subject while inside the scanner bore. One solution is to 
cannulate the tail vein using a butterﬂy catheter. Connect an 
insulin syringe containing the radiolabeled cell (>50 Bq) to the 
distal end of the tubing, and then depress the plunger slightly 
until the catheter tubing and needle are ﬁlled with the solution. 
Insert the needle into the lateral tail vein. The animal is now 
ready to be moved to the scanner bed. Maintain gas anesthesia 
(1–2% isoﬂurane and 0.5 l/min oxygen ﬂow). 
3. Initiate list-mode PET acquisition. The acquisition should last 
long enough to observe cell migration. Initial migration will be 
observed within seconds of administering the cell; subsequent 
migration may be observed within the next hour or so based on 
the type of cell and administration route.

338
Kyung Oh. Jung and Guillem Pratx
4. Slowly depress the plunger to inject the sample. You may place 
a radiation survey meter near the tail to audibly detect the 
passage of the radioactive cell. 
5. Once the acquisition is complete, import the list-mode data ﬁle 
into MATLAB. Based on the scanner, this may require con-
verting the data from a vendor-speciﬁc machine format into a 
MATLAB-interpretable format. The scanner manufacturer 
may provide information regarding this step. 
6. It is important to identify the exact time at which the cell 
entered the ﬁeld of view of the scanner. Prior to that time, 
the only detected counts are noise and background radioactiv-
ity; thus, the reconstruction should start only once the cell has 
entered the ﬁeld of view. The arrival of the cell is marked by a 
marked increase in the event count rate, which can be com-
puted form the list-mode data. 
7. Run the CellGPS code according to the package instructions. 
The package can be downloaded online (see Note 1). Several 
parameters should be adjusted by the user. First, set the track-
ing start time to the value obtained in the previous step. Sec-
ond, based on the activity and velocity of the cell, the number 
of spline knots should be adjusted to achieve a good trade-off 
between the ﬂexibility of the trajectory (how easily it will 
conform to the path of the cell) and noise rejection. As a rule 
of thumb, the reconstructed trajectory should have 1 knot for 
every 50 detected counts. This number may be adjusted until a 
suitable result is obtained. If too many knots are used in the 
reconstruction relative to the number of counts available, the 
reconstructed trajectory will appear noisy. On the other hand, if 
too few counts are used, the full range of motion of the cell may 
not be captured. This effect is demonstrated in Fig. 3. 
8. Visualize the reconstructed trajectory, which can be superim-
posed over CT scan of the same subject.

1. Reconstruction code for dynamic cell tracking is available 
online as a Code Ocean capsule at https://doi.org/10. 
24433/CO.5746631.v1. A detailed description and evalua-
tion of the algorithm has been reported [3]. 
2. The entire cell labeling procedure using radiolabeled MSN 
takes approximately 90 min, which is the equivalent of ~1.5 
half-lives for 68 Ga (half-life 67 min). Additional time is needed 
afterward for isolating and selecting a suitable number of single 
cells. In addition, radiotracer efﬂux from cells, which can reach 
50% after 2 h, is another factor that can reduce radioactivity of

Fig. 3 Example of trajectories reconstructed using different numbers of knots, for 
a single cell moving along a helical trajectory inside a phantom (2168 counts). 
Only the x coordinate is shown here for simplicity. The black and red lines 
represent the reconstructed and ground truth trajectories, respectively 
labeled cells. Therefore, when using short-lived 68 Ga, it is 
important to plan experiment carefully in view of the time 
required for each experimental step. 
3. For radiolabeling of MSNs, the efﬁciency depends on reaction 
temperature, reaction time, and reaction pH. These factors can 
be optimized for best results. 
4. To enhance cellular uptake of radiolabeled MSNs, the nano-
particles should be fused with a liposome-based transfection 
reagent to coat their surface with a lipid bilayer. This coating 
also helps achieve high biocompatibility. 
5. The most crucial step for successful tracking of single cells 
in vivo is to prepare single cells with sufﬁcient levels of radioac-
tivity. On the Inveon PET scanner, cells should have at least 
20 Bq of radioactivity to be detected in static scans or 50 Bq to 
be tracked dynamically while moving. However, these values 
may vary based on the PET scanner being used. Scanners built 
from BGO detectors (e.g., Soﬁe Biosciences G4 or G8) have 
almost no intrinsic radioactivity background, and, therefore, 
they are able to detect lower amounts of radioactivity [4]. 
6. Identifying cells with high radioactivity can be challenging. 
Using serial dilution in Terasaki plate, you should isolate single

340
Kyung Oh. Jung and Guillem Pratx
cells stained with Hoechst 33342 using ﬂuorescence micros-
copy, and then quickly conﬁrm the radioactivity of single cell 
using a portable radiation survey meter. Gamma counting may 
be used subsequently to quantify the radioactivity of individual 
cells. 
7. Due to naturally occurring radioactivity from 176 Lu present in 
the LSO scintillators of PET detectors, the acquisition protocol 
should include a lower energy discriminator of 425 keV to 
minimize background and detect the weak signals of radiola-
beled single cells. This value may vary based on the PET 
scanner being used. 
8. For long-term tracking experiments using 89 Zr-MSNs, it is 
important to consider the potential toxicity due to prolonged 
exposure of labeled cells to ionizing radiation.

Abstract 
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging provides unique information of the cellular and molecular 
pathways of disease occurring within the human body, using measurements made from outside the body, 
which has shown utility in a variety of studies from basic research to clinical applications. This chapter 
describes some of the most relevant PET system parameters that impact its imaging performance such as 3D 
spatial, energy, and coincidence timing resolutions and the methodology typically used to evaluate those 
parameters. In addition, the physical principles underlying PET imaging, PET photon detector technology, 
and coincidence detection are also described. As a closing remark, the future perspectives of PET imaging 
and its simultaneous use with anatomical imaging techniques (e.g., computed tomography [CT] and 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are outlined.

Introduction 
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging uses radioactive 
contrast agents, known as radiotracers, for the detection, diagnosis, 
monitoring, and therapy assessment of a variety of medical condi-
tions. It constitutes the most used molecular imaging technique in 
the clinic as well as in preclinical research [1–4]. 
The historical breakthroughs contributing to the development 
of PET imaging started with the prediction of the positron by Dirac 
in 1929 [5] and its experimental discovery by Anderson in 1933 
[6]. During the next years, other milestones were achieved such as 
the discovery of radioactive elements by Curie and Joliot, the use of 
a cyclotron for the artiﬁcial production of positron-emitting radio-
nuclides at the University of California in Berkeley [7], and the 
development of the scintillator [8] and photomultiplier tube 
(PMT) used for the detection of 511 kilo-electron-volt (keV)

Motivated by these technological breakthroughs, in 1951, 
Wren, Good, and Handler ﬁrst reported on the possible use of 
coincidence detection to generate medical images [10], and, only 
2 years later, Brownell and Sweet built the ﬁrst positron imaging 
device for the detection of brain tumors [11]. During the next 
years, Rankowitz and his team designed the ﬁrst operative positron 
scanner that was based on NaI(Tl) cylindrical detectors assembled 
in a ring geometry [12], and Anger and Gottschalk reported on the 
design of a full positron camera [13]. Finally, in the 1970s, Robert-
son and Thompson built the so-called Positome [14] (see Fig. 1a), 
and, 
contemporaneously, 
Phelps, 
Hoffman, 
Mullani, 
and 
Ter-Pogossian built the so-called PETT [15, 16] (Fig. 1b) starting 
a collaboration with EG&G ORTEC to build the ﬁrst commercial 
PET scanner known as ECAT I [17]. 
Over the next years, advancements on both the synthesis of 
radiotracers for clinical use [18] and on the PET scintillation detec-
tor array manufacturing process [19] were achieved. The photode-
tector technology also evolved and solid-state photodetectors 
appeared, i.e., avalanche photodiodes (APDs) [20] and later silicon 
photomultipliers (SiPMs) [21, 22]. Since then, PET detector tech-
nology has continuously improved, and, nowadays, commercially 
available clinical PET scanners offer spatial resolutions of ~4 mm at 
the system center [23] and 214 ps coincidence time resolution 
(CTR) [24], which deﬁnes the system’s ability to estimate the 
arrival time difference of the annihilation photons into two coinci-
dent detectors. Although improvements over previous generation 
PET systems have been accomplished, 4 mm resolution, still is

often inadequate for visualizing small lesions important for early 
detection of disease. In addition, state-of-the-art PET scanners 
report relatively low photon sensitivity, requiring high tracer dose 
and long scanning times (reduced patient throughput). To enhance 
resolution and increase system photon sensitivity, specially designed 
PET systems that may be placed close to the organ of interest have 
been developed [25]. Moreover, methods to include information 
on the photon depth of interactions (DOI) in the scintillation 
crystals is an important factor that PET system designers have 
studied to preserve resolution uniformity throughout the useful 
ﬁeld of view (FOV) in the detection of highly penetrating 511 keV 
photons. Another approach to improve 511 keV photon detection 
sensitivity is to increase the axial FOV (length) of PET scanners 
[26–28]. However, these long axial FOV scanners are much more 
expensive and require large hospital footprints.

Physical Principles of PET 
2.1 
Positron 
Emission and 
Annihilation 
PET imaging relies on the simultaneous detection of millions of 
oppositely directed 511 keV photon pairs that result from the 
annihilation of a positron (e+ ) with its antiparticle, the electron 
(e-). Positrons are emitted from proton-rich nuclei—which are 
unstable for positron decay—and travel a short but variable range 
in the patient body, causing excitation and ionization of the atoms 
they traverse before they slow down enough to annihilate with 
nearby electrons [31, 32]. 
2.2 
Photon 
Interaction with Matter 
The two 511 keV annihilation photons generated in the e+ - e-
annihilation are detected using a high-density scintillation material. 
The probability of detection, known as detection efﬁciency, 
depends on the scintillator material thickness and linear attenuation 
coefﬁcient (μ), which in turn depends on the effective atomic 
number and density of the material and the photon energy. 
Photon–matter interactions can be described in terms of parti-
cle collisions, where the energy of the incident photon is partially or 
completely transferred to the electrons or to the atomic nuclei in 
the scintillation material via: 
1. The photoelectric effect, in which the incident photon transfers 
all its energy to an inner-shell electron of one of the scintillator 
material atoms. The probability of photoelectric interactions 
increases with the atomic number of the scintillator (Zeff) and 
its density (ρ) and decreases with increasing photon energy 
[32] (see Fig. 2a); 
2. Compton scattering, in which the incident photon interacts 
with an outer electron of the scintillation material atoms, trans-
ferring only a portion of its energy and thus being deviated

346

lines indicate where the cross section for two processes is equal. As an example, in a LGSO scintillator 
(Zeff ≈ 63), the most probable interaction for 511 keV photons is Compton scatter, although photoelectric 
absorption is non-negligible; (b) energy band structure of an inorganic scintillator. Left side, pure scintillator. 
Right side, activated scintillator 
from its original direction [33, 34]. Its probability reduces with 
the incident photon energy, depends on the material density, 
and is almost independent of Zeff (see Fig. 2a); 
3. Pair production, in which the photon interacts with the atomic 
nucleus in such a manner that its energy is converted into 
matter, producing a pair of particles (e+ - e-) [35]. This process 
requires photons with energies >1.02 MeV (combined rest 
mass of the electron plus positron); thus, it is not encountered 
in PET. 
The photoelectric and Compton interactions both result in the 
ejection of a fast recoil electron, which interacts with the medium 
traversed, resulting in a track of low-energy ionization electrons. 
Note that photoelectric interactions are preferred in PET imaging 
since all the energy is deposited in one interaction location, and it 
generates a larger electric signal compared to Compton interac-
tions, thus producing better detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
and the single interaction also simpliﬁes positioning of the photon 
interaction point within the scintillator, thus providing better 
reconstructed image quality. Algorithms that exploit the kinematics 
of Compton scatter in order to better estimate the ﬁrst interaction 
location (in 3D) of Compton interactions in the detector crystal are 
under study by several groups [36]. 
2.3 
Scintillation 
Mechanism in 
Inorganic Scintillators 
The scintillation material in a PET detector is responsible for con-
verting each incident 511 keV photon into lower-energy optical 
photons (eV range) that are subsequently collected by photodetec-
tor elements and converted into measurable electrical pulses which 
represent the photon energy and arrival time. 
The detection efﬁciency of the scintillator depends on Zeff; 
thus, inorganic scintillators (high Zeff) are the most commonly

used detector materials in PET scanners [8]; see Table 1. The 
scintillation mechanism in inorganic scintillators depends on the 
electronic band structure of the crystal lattice of the material; there 
are two quantized energy bands of closely spaced electronic energy 
levels, called the valence and conduction bands, and the energy 
difference between the two bands is known as the bandgap 
[37]. When a 511 keV photon interacts with the scintillation mate-
rial (see Subheading 2.2) via photoelectric or Compton interac-
tions, the resulting ionization electrons are liberated from the 
valence band to the conduction band, creating a track of electron– 
hole (e-h) pairs. After a period of time, these electrons return to the 
valence band emitting light photons with an energy determined by 
the bandgap. In a pure scintillator, the bandgap is large, and thus 
the emitted light has a higher frequency (in the ultraviolet 
[UV] range) which is difﬁcult to detect by standard photodetec-
tors, and the decay rate (i.e., decay time) tends to be slower. To 
promote the generation of visible light photons (e.g., peaked in 
blue wavelengths), small amounts of impurities, called activators, 
are added to the crystal, creating special sites in the lattice and 
modifying the bandgap structure. The energy of the released 
photons is in the visible regime which is good for photodetection 
(Fig. 2b), and the decay rate is increased (decay time is decreased).

PET Detector Technology 
The most common PET photon detector modules are mainly 
composed of arrays of scintillation crystal elements coupled at its 
ends to photodetector arrays, which is coupled to readout 
electronics.

3.1 
Scintillator 
Elements 
Each incoming 511 keV annihilation photon should efﬁciently 
interact with the scintillation array and be converted into 
low-energy scintillation photons as described in Subheading 2.3. 
The ideal PET scintillator should possess the following properties 
[38]: (1) high light yield (LY), which is the number of optical 
photons generated per unit of deposited energy; (2) linearity, 
which means the number of generated optical photons must be 
proportional to the energy deposited by the incident radiation, 
which, among other beneﬁts, allows one to distinguish photoelec-
tric and Compton interactions in the detector; (3) clear and trans-
parent to the wavelength of its own emission spectra; (4) high Zeff 
to increase the probability of photoelectric interactions; (5) fast 
decay time of the induced luminescence to avoid pileup events, 
hence minimizing the dead time and improving system CTR; and 
(6) a refraction index as close as possible to that of the photodetec-
tor, maximizing the light transmission into the photodetector. 
There are two main scintillation conﬁgurations used in PET 
detectors, namely, pixel arrays and monolithic crystals; see Fig. 3a, 
b, respectively. Pixelated crystal arrays comprise a matrix of individ-
ual small scintillation rod elements [39], while monolithic scintilla-
tors consist of a large single piece of scintillation material [40, 41], 
and therefore there are no inter-element gaps. Advantages and 
disadvantages of each conﬁguration can be found in [40]. 
Subheading 5 of this chapter describes the spatial, DOI, energy, 
and timing resolution of pixelated-based detectors since they are 
the ones commonly used in commercial PET scanners. 
3.2 
Photodetector: 
PMTs and SiPMs 
A photodetector suitable for PET imaging has to efﬁciently convert 
the scintillation photons into electric signals while ensuring both 
high photon detection efﬁciency (PDE(λ,V)), which, for SiPMs, is a 
product of the quantum efﬁciency (QE(λ)), and the ﬁll factor of the 
sensor microcells. Moreover, the photodetector has to be compact,

insensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations, and detect photons with 
low time jitter, thus providing a low variance and short response 
time between the arrival of the photons and the signal generation. 
PET System Technology
349
Since the earliest days of PET imaging, PMTs [42] have been 
used to collect scintillation photons. PMTs have high gain and low 
noise and are sensitive for light in the UV, visible, and near-infrared 
ranges of the electromagnetic spectra. However, they are affected 
by magnetic ﬁelds, making it impossible to be used in PET/MRI 
systems. During the last decade, a majority of the newer generation 
PET systems employ SiPMs instead of PMTs; SiPMs are semicon-
ductor (solid-state) detectors composed of thousands of micron-
size single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cells connected in par-
allel to common readout contacts [43]. Each SPAD microcell 
operates in the Geiger mode, which means they are biased at a 
voltage value that is over the breakdown voltage, and thus they 
have a very high gain. They also have the properties of very low 
temperature drift, low operating voltage, and excellent temporal 
response and are insensitive to magnetic ﬁelds. In addition, they are 
much more compact than PMTs allowing for complex and mechan-
ically robust system conﬁguration while reducing dead spaces. 
However, factors contributing to the SiPM noise and timing jitter 
are dark count rates (DCR), optical cross talk, afterpulsing, and 
dead time that have to be addressed to provide accurate informa-
tion on the incoming annihilation photon interaction location, 
energy, and arrival time [44]. Depending on whether readout 
electronics are external to the devices or integrated within the 
sensor technology, SiPMs can be classiﬁed as either analog or digital 
(dSiPMs), respectively [45, 46]. 
3.3 
Front-End 
Readout Electronics 
The ﬁnal elements of PET detector modules are the front-end 
readout electronics, which are responsible for processing and digi-
tizing the photodetector output signals for the data acquisition 
system (DAQ), which sends those signals to a workstation 
(PC) for further processing. When using SiPMs, the digital control 
and processing of the output of analog-to-digital conversion 
(ADC) 
boards 
are 
usually 
accomplished 
using 
a 
ﬁeld-
programmable gate array (FPGA). 
The best approach to provide good photon positioning accu-
racy and CTR performance is to read out every pixel of the photo-
detector array, but this implies digitizing a huge number of signals, 
which is typically challenging. To diminish the problem, many 
techniques might be used to reduce the number of signals such as 
electronic multiplexing schemes [47]. However, these approaches 
may degrade timing information. An alternative is the use of fast 
integrated circuits such as application-speciﬁc integrated circuits 
(ASICs) customized for a particular use, i.e., reading out each 
SiPM signal.

Coincidence Detection 
As brieﬂy described in Subheadings 2 and 3, each radiotracer decay 
emits a positron that slows down by colliding with atoms in its path 
in the surrounding tissue. Near the end of its trajectory, the posi-
tron combines (annihilates) with an electron, resulting in the emis-
sion of two oppositely directed annihilation photons that are 
emitted from the body. If both emitted photons are directed 
toward the PET system, they will likely interact in two opposing 
detectors of the PET scanner, generating two sets of electric signals 
from each detector. Sometimes one or both of the annihilation 
photons suffer Compton scattering, leaving energy in the patient 
tissue before exiting the body; such events should be rejected 
during the data processing. 
To ensure the collection of events resulting only from annihila-
tion processes, a coincidence time window (CTW), usually in the 
range of few nanoseconds, is deﬁned in the PET coincidence pro-
cessing, and only those events detected within the same CTW are 
recorded and labeled as a coincidence event. There is also an energy 
window applied to each photon event; if the measured energy is 
signiﬁcantly less than 511 keV, it is assumed that the photon is 
scattered, and that event is rejected. Events that pass the energy and 
coincidence time window ﬁlters will then be assigned to a system 
line of response (LOR) that connects the two detector elements 
that were hit by the good annihilation photon event. In PET, it is 
assumed that this line passes through the precise location of the 
positron decay. 
Note however that sometimes the assigned LOR may not pass 
through the point of the actual positron decay, and therefore the 
image quality is degraded, as described in Subheadings 4.1 and 4.2. 
As a ﬁnal step, data correction methods and reconstruction algo-
rithms are applied to the collected coincidence events to generate 
3D images providing detailed visual representations of the 3D 
radiotracer biodistribution within a patient’s body. The radiotracer 
selection depends on the study to be carried out [48–51]. Figure 4a 
shows a schematic of the PET imaging formation process. 
4.1 
Image 
Degradation Caused 
by Physical Effects 
The quality and accuracy of the reconstructed PET image is 
affected by several physical factors such as: 
1. The variation in positron range, deﬁned as the average distance 
from the point of positron decay to the end of the positron 
track where the annihilation photons are created. This factor 
depends on the emitted positron energies, which depends on 
the radionuclide label of the tracer and directly affects the 
spatial resolution [31, 33];

the event spread across the entire assigned LOR and the blue one the portion of that LOR where events are 
concentrated after applying the TOF constraint 
2. The crystal element width introduces a variation in annihilation 
photon interaction location and thus affects the spatial resolu-
tion but also the CTR performance; 
3. 511 keV photon pair acolinearity, which occurs when the posi-
tron and electron are not at rest when they annihilate, resulting 
in a small deviation from 180° in the angle between the two 
annihilation photons [52], and leads to incorrect LOR assign-
ment, and thus spatial resolution degradation, depending on 
the PET system diameter; 
4. Parallax error, related to the uncertainty in the annihilation 
photon interaction depth coordinate (the DOI) within the 
detector element. This effect produces an error in LOR assign-
ment, and thus spatial resolution degradation, that gets worse 
with radial coordinate from the system center. If the detector 
design provides DOI information, then this factor may be 
compensated. For this reason, the development of DOI-
encoding detectors is an ongoing research topic in PET instru-
mentation [53]; 
5. Event statistics and the image reconstruction process. 
4.2 
Degradation 
Caused by 
Coincidence Detection 
Type 
There are four types of coincidence events recorded in a PET scan 
[52], namely: 
1. Trues, where the assigned LOR for an event passes through the 
point of positron annihilation; 
2. Scattered, when one or both detected annihilation photons 
have undergone at least one Compton scatter in the patient 
and its direction has changed; thus, the assigned LOR does not

Fig. 5 From left to right, representation of true, scattered, random, and multiple events 
pass through the point of positron annihilation, degrading 
image contrast and accuracy; 
3. Randoms, when two photons from different annihilation 
events are detected within the CTW, which also degrades 
image contrast and accuracy. The distribution of random coin-
cidences is almost uniform across the FOV, and its rate 
increases with the square of the activity in the FOV; 
4. Multiples, when more than two annihilation photons are 
detected within the CTW, making impossible to determine 
the correct LOR; thus, these multiple coincidences are rejected 
from the dataset. 
Figure 5 provides an example of each type of coincident events 
encountered in PET. Note that only true coincidences provide 
accurate information about the radiotracer deposition in the sub-
ject. Several methods are used to compensate for scatter and ran-
dom coincidences [54].

PET Detector Performance Parameters 
The main parameters that are considered when designing a typical 
PET scanner are the spatial, energy, and coincidence time resolu-
tions. The methodology usually employed to evaluate those para-
meters is outlined in Subheading 6. 
5.1 
Spatial 
Resolution 
There are two types of resolution measures in PET, intrinsic and 
reconstructed. Intrinsic refers to the spatial resolution limit 
imposed by the detector element dimensions, as well as positron 
range and annihilation photon acolinearity variations, which can be 
assessed with coincidence measurements between two detector 
elements or modules by measuring a distribution known as the 
point spread function (PSF). Reconstructed PET resolution refers 
to that measured after the image reconstruction process and may be 
assessed, for example, by determining how close two-point sources

can be placed together while still distinguishing them in an image. 
Note that as explained in Subheading 4.1, PET system resolution is 
strongly determined by the intrinsic resolution, but it also is 
affected by the image reconstruction process. 
PET System Technology
353
In the case of detector modules based on pixelated crystals, the 
intrinsic resolution of a pair of pixelated PET detectors determined 
from a PSF measurement can be estimated as [55]: 
Rint = 
R2 
det þ R2 
range þ R2 
180 °
ð1Þ 
where Rdet, Rrange, and R180° are the detector resolution, positron 
range, and the acolinearity effect contributions to resolution, 
respectively. In pixelated-based detector designs without signal 
multiplexing, Rdet is roughly ½ the width of the crystal element 
width; with multiplexing, an additional decoding term should be 
applied [55]. For the overall PET system spatial resolution, one 
would multiply Rint by an addition factor due to imperfections of 
the image reconstruction process due to factors such as the count 
statistics (i.e., noise level) of the study, linear and angular sampling 
deﬁciencies, and image reconstruction characteristics such as the 
effective degree of smoothing. 
5.2 
DOI Resolution
The DOI resolution (a type of spatial resolution) is the precision to 
which the third spatial coordinate (z coordinate or the photon 
interaction depth within the scintillator element) may be deter-
mined. DOI information can be continuous or discrete and helps 
to reduce the parallax error in order to preserve uniformity of the 
resolution in the radial direction; see Subheading 4.1. 
For pixelated-based detectors, retrieving DOI information is 
not straightforward and usually requires the use of additional scin-
tillator layers and photodetector elements [56] and/or special 
crystal surface treatments and reﬂectors [57], compact front-end 
electronics, and additional readout channels [58], thus increasing 
manufacturing cost and system complexity. However, drawbacks of 
most of these DOI methods are that they (1) can only determine 
one DOI, which is a problem when the photon interacts more than 
once, which is roughly threefold more likely to occur than single 
interactions, and (2) usually degrade detector SNR, worsening 
detector energy resolution and CTR. 
5.3 
Energy 
Resolution 
The energy resolution (ER) represents the precision to which a 
PET detector can measure the deposited energy of the photon 
interaction, which, as described in Subheading 2.2, helps to ﬁlter 
out photons that have undergone Compton scatter in the patient 
tissues before being detected. In a pixelated detector design, ER 
depends on the scintillator light yield, the crystal element dimen-
sions, optical coupling to the photodetector, properties of the latter 
such as PDE and noise, and the noise level of the electronic

readout. The energy resolution is usually evaluated as the ratio of 
the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the 511 keV photopeak 
in the pulse height spectrum to its centroid [57]. 
354
Andrea Gonzalez-Montoro and Craig S. Levin
5.4 
CTR
The CTR of a PET system deﬁnes the uncertainty on detecting the 
arrival time difference between each pair of annihilation photons in 
a coincidence event, over many events, and is determined by several 
factors including properties of the scintillation crystal (rise and 
decay times), number of scintillation photons collected by the 
photodetector, photodetector PDE and noise properties, crystal-
to-photodetector coupling conﬁgurations, reﬂective materials, and 
the readout electronic chain. Achieving accurate CTR allows one to 
constrain the location of the annihilation point along the LOR 
(Eq. 2) [59]; since more events are placed closer to the true 
location along the LOR during the image reconstruction process, 
the statistical noise levels are reduced, improving the reconstructed 
image SNR (Eq. 3): 
ΔX = c∙ΔT 
2
ð2Þ 
Gain in SNR = 
D 
ΔX 
1=2 
= 
2∙D 
c∙ΔT 
1=2 
ð3Þ 
where ΔX is the uncertainty of the annihilation event location along 
each system LOR, c is the speed of the light, ΔT = CTR of the 
system, and D is the patient diameter. Including temporal informa-
tion on the photon arrival is known as time of ﬂight (TOF)-PET. 
Figure 4b shows a sketch of the conceptual principle. As an exam-
ple, if the CTR improves from 600 ps to 100 ps, a gain in recon-
structed image SNR of a factor of 
6
p 
is expected. This increase in 
SNR can be exploited to enhance lesion visualization and quantiﬁ-
cation or, alternatively, decrease the injected radiation dose or 
patient scanning time, or a mixture of these. Moreover, including 
this information can be useful for systems with nonstandard (e.g., 
panel or partial ring geometries) since the number of angular views 
necessary for an artifact-free image reconstruction is reduced as 
CTR improves [60, 61]. 
Presently, the best of the state-of-the-art PET systems achieves 
214 ps FWHM CTR [62]. However, with progress in the develop-
ment SiPMs, a CTR well below 100 ps FWHM may be easily 
achievable in single-pixel, benchtop setups using long scintillators 
[63–68]. 
5.5 
Other 
Considerations 
To maximize spatial, DOI, energy, and CTR performance of a PET 
detector, important aspects to consider are the reﬂector applied to 
the scintillator crystal element surfaces, the crystal surface rough-
ness, and the scintillator–photodetector coupling media. These 
factors determine the amount of light reﬂections on the crystal 
surfaces, the light transport within the crystal, and the collected 
LD proﬁles.

PET System Technology
355
There are many different crystal reﬂectors and surface condi-
tions described in the literature that focus on reducing reﬂections 
to preserve LD proﬁles (e.g., absorbent black paint and retroreﬂec-
tor layers) [69] or on increasing those reﬂections to increase the 
amount of light reaching the photodetector (Teﬂon, white paints, 
and enhanced specular reﬂectors [ESR]). Regarding scintillator– 
photodetector coupling, silicone or optical grease is most com-
monly used for prototyping and optical epoxy for production. It 
is better to use coupling medias with refractive indices somewhere 
in between that of the photodetector surface (e.g., glass) and that 
of the scintillator crystal to reduce light transmission losses [70]. 
6 
Experimental Methodology to Evaluate PET Performance Parameters 
There are two evaluation stages when designing a PET scanner, 
namely, detector level, which accounts for the intrinsic performance 
of one or more detector elements or detector modules comprising 
arrays of detector elements, and system level, which focuses on the 
global performance of the scanner (e.g., reconstructed image qual-
ity and accuracy) as a research or diagnostic tool. 
In the following, the most commonly used approaches to 
evaluate both detector and system performance are described, 
using as an example the methodology followed in our lab to char-
acterize energy resolution and CTR performance of TOF-PET 
detectors based on arrays of discrete scintillation detector elements 
coupled to photodetectors. 
6.1 
Detector Level
Performance evaluation of PET detectors involves the characteriza-
tion of the intrinsic properties of each element building the detec-
tor module, namely, scintillation crystal (including reﬂector and 
surface condition), photodetectors (including coupling media to 
the crystal), and electronic readout chain (Subheading 3). Each one 
of those elements needs to be ﬁrst characterized individually, to 
ensure optimal performance, and then in combination to charac-
terize the ﬁnal detector design for spatial, energy, and temporal 
information. 
Regarding the scintillation crystal, its dimension, geometry, 
and intrinsic scintillation properties affect the photoemission efﬁ-
ciency of the detector, while the crystal surface treatment, reﬂector, 
and crystal–photodetector coupling medium affect the light trans-
ferring to the photodetector [70]. Note that reﬂector materials and 
optical coupling components only affect the light transferring to 
the photodetector and thus the number and temporal spread of 
collected scintillation photons. LY and rise and decay times are not 
affected since those are intrinsic parameters of the scintillator. For 
their evaluation, it is common to couple the scintillation crystal to a 
PMT, as shown in Fig. 6a. Usually, only those events that have pulse

heights within the FWTM of 511 keV photopeak are processed; see 
Fig. 6b. The decay time of the scintillator is estimated by exponen-
tially ﬁtting the tail of pulses within the range from 90% to 10% of 
the maximum pulse height. Similarly, the rise time is measured by 
exponentially ﬁtting the rising edge of pulses but within the range 
from 10% to 90% (Fig. 6c).

emission, which occurs a fraction of the time, is also shown; (c) example of the acquired waveforms, 
indicating the ranges considered for the estimation of the rise and decay times 
The next element that needs to be studied in isolation is the 
photodetector. When working with SiPMs, the parameters that are 
usually evaluated are [43]: the breakdown voltage, which is the bias 
point that needs to be reached to initiate a Geiger discharge; the 
gain, which refers to the average amount of charge created for each 
detected photon; the PDE(λ,V), which refers to the sensitivity of 
the photodetector; the DCR, which is the main source of noise in 
an SiPM and is primarily due to the generation of thermal electrons 
in the active volume; the optical cross talk between single cells; the 
afterpulsing due to the charge that gets trapped in a cell and is 
released after some time generating a secondary discharge; and the 
dynamic range. 
Finally, the readout electronic chain (see Subheading 3.3) must 
be also designed and studied in detail. The selection of the compo-
nents (i.e., capacitor, resistors, RF ampliﬁers, ASICs, etc.) compris-
ing the electronic chain is the most relevant factor affecting CTR 
performance. The main parameters to consider when designing the 
electronic chain are: the inherent electronic noise (σnoise), the tran-
sit transfer time (TTS) of the pulses from the photodetector to the 
electronic components (σTTS), and the signal slope (dV/dt) which 
is a combination of both the detector signal and time response

[71]. The combination of these parameters determines the tempo-
ral variance, or jitter, (σtime) in the photodetector response and can 
be estimated as:

Once the scintillator, photodetector, and electronic chain have 
been individually studied and optimized, the ﬁnal PET detector 
module can be assembled. Then, the evaluation focuses on the 
spatial, DOI, energy resolutions, and CTR of the detector. To 
study these parameters, two identical PET detector elements are 
used, and coincidence data are acquired. The experiments are 
repeated several times to ensure truthfulness of the data using 
different scintillation elements and photodetectors. In addition, 
the inﬂuence of different bias voltages, threshold levels, tempera-
ture drifts, and other factors is also evaluated. 
In the following, examples of the methodology usually used to 
evaluate those parameters are outlined. 
6.2 
Detector Spatial 
Resolution 
The spatial resolution of a PET detector is usually estimated as the 
average FWHM and FWTM of the Gaussian ﬁt applied to the LD 
proﬁles obtained by acquiring data using radioactive sources. In the 
case of pixelated-based detectors, the source is placed in between 
the two detector elements being characterized to ensure a homo-
geneous irradiation of the entire pixelated matrix. Coincidence data 
is acquired, and after applying positioning algorithms, 2D ﬂood 
maps are generated. These ﬂood maps are visual representations of 
the light collected by each individual pixel element; see Fig. 7a, b. 
Pixel proﬁles are extracted, and Gaussian ﬁtting is applied; the 
average FWHM of the ﬁtting is considered as the detector spatial

pixel distribution showing extracted proﬁles for the column highlighted in red

resolution. The peak to valley (P/V) of the proﬁles is also a good 
estimator of the spatial resolution; the more accused the valley, the 
better the pixel discrimination and thus the better the spatial reso-
lution. Note that, as described in Subheading 5.1, the spatial reso-
lution is mainly limited by the individual scintillator pixel size. 
Usually, for the spatial resolution evaluation in order to avoid 
undesired scattered events that worsen the average resolution 
value, only events that fall within the FWTM of the 511 keV 
photopeak are considered.

across several depths, (b) the CTR of scintillation detectors used in PET, and (c) temporal difference histogram 
between two detector elements 
6.3 
Detector DOI 
Resolution 
The evaluation of the photon DOI resolution of a PET detector is 
usually performed through side beam illumination experiment in 
which a radioactive source is placed in such a way that impinges 
perpendicularly to one detector. The source is displaced (together 
with the coincidence detector) across the z axis, illuminating differ-
ent known depths across the scintillation element. Coincidence 
data is acquired and processed, and then histograms showing the 
number of counts vs depth are generated (Fig. 8a), and the DOI 
resolution is estimated as the FWHM of the Gaussian ﬁt applied to 
those proﬁles. 
6.4 
Detector Energy 
Resolution 
To 
evaluate 
the 
energy 
resolution 
of 
a 
PET 
detector, 
a 
non-collimated radioactive source is used to homogeneously irra-
diate the detector under evaluation. Then waveforms are acquired, 
and energy histograms are usually generated considering the wave-
form area above a certain threshold value. Note that PET detectors 
usually provide data in arbitrary units (channels, voltage, etc.); thus, 
the ﬁrst step is to calibrate the output value into energy units, 
usually keV. For this purpose, different isotopes (with different 
energy peaks) are used to acquire data, and the measured centroid 
of each photopeak is plotted against the theoretical energy value of 
the corresponding isotope. Then, the data is ﬁtted using an expo-
nential function that provides the calibration curve, which allows 
conversion of the x-axis of the pulse height histogram into energy

units (Fig. 6b). Then, regions of interest (ROIs) across the 2D 
ﬂood maps are selected, and the resulting spectra are ﬁtted using a 
Gaussian function. The energy resolution is ﬁnally estimated as 
ΔE/E × 100% where ΔE is the FWHM and E the centroid (detector 
Gain) of the 511 keV photopeak. Note that these experiments are 
also used to evaluate the different gain values (affected by, e.g., 
scintillator uniformities, photodetector variances, or coupling 
materials) across the scintillator surface.

6.5 
Detector CTR
To evaluate the CTR performance of a pair of detector elements, 
coincidence measurements are performed by placing a radioactive 
source in between the detectors (Fig. 8b). Waveforms are acquired, 
and the photon arrival time (time stamp) of each photon to the 
detector is recorded. Note that the method employed for the 
timing pickoff in the rising edge of the signal has a large impact 
on CTR performance. Several methods can be applied; usually a 
threshold value is selected, and the arrival time of the photon is 
considered as the time at which the signal crosses that threshold. In 
addition, baseline and time-walk corrections are usually applied to 
enhance CTR performance [65]. 
Finally, the temporal differences between the two detector 
elements for every annihilation pair coincidence event are histo-
gramed, and Gaussian ﬁtting is applied. The FWHM of the ﬁt 
represents the CTR of the detector pair; see Fig. 8c. Note that 
scintillation light sharing or photodetector signal multiplexing 
schemes that are often employed to reduce the number of photo-
detectors or readout channels severely affect CTR performance; the 
best approach is to couple every individual scintillation pixel ele-
ment one-to-one to a single photodetector, a.k.a. “one-to-one 
coupling,” to avoid dealing with variances among individual detec-
tor elements. But this approach will also lead to the largest number 
of photodetectors and associated electronic readout channels. 
6.6 
Other 
Evaluations 
In addition to the parameters described before, there are other 
factors affecting performance that need to be evaluated, such as 
the scintillator material and surface treatment, scintillator–photo-
detector coupling media, photodetector arrangement, tempera-
ture, bias voltage applied to the SiPMs, or electronic components, 
to mention but a few. To do so, several measurements (spatial, 
DOI, energy resolution, and CTR) are performed after modifying 
those elements. The outputs are compared to ground-truth mea-
surements, and the ﬁnal selection of these features depends on the 
parameters that are selected for optimization, often leading to a 
trade-off between the different properties. 
The next step is to combine the already characterized individual 
detector elements and scale up the design into detector module 
arrays. At this stage, critical factors to consider are the number of 
elements comprising one detector module; their arrangement to

minimize gaps between individual elements, thus providing high 
packing fraction and good sensitivity; and the electronic readout 
schematics in which design is a trade-off between performance, 
power consumption, and number of output signals. Once carefully 
ensembled, the detector module arrays are characterized by usually 
using a homogeneous source that irradiates the whole detector 
surface. The detector spatial, energy, and CTR performances are 
then evaluated, with Fig. 7b illustrating a ﬂood map typically used 
for the detector characterization. In addition, detector calibration 
procedures are required at this stage to correct for nonuniformities, 
mainly produced by light yield differences across the scintillation 
volume or by gain differences in the photodetector response that 
will increase the statistical variations of the output information, 
thus generating image inhomogeneities. The energy response of 
the detectors is calibrated into keV values, and detector parameters 
such as cooling requirements or count rate capabilities are also 
considered.

Andrea Gonzalez-Montoro and Craig S. Levin
Once the performance evaluation of the PET detector module 
is ﬁnished and all parameters have been optimized to ensure best 
performance, the scaling-up process begins. More layers of scintil-
lations and next steps in the electronic chain are included. Finally, 
more detectors are built and assembled, usually, in a ring geometry, 
composing the ﬁnal PET scanner.

Tutorial of Experimental Methodology 
In the following, a description of the approach typically followed in 
the evaluation of PET detector elements and PET systems is 
provided. 
7.1 
PET Detector 
Element Evaluation 
An example of the methodology used in our lab to evaluate energy 
resolution and CTR performance of two PET detector elements 
based on pixelated crystals is detailed below: 
1. Select the scintillator material, for example, 3 × 3 × 10 mm3 
LGSO crystals (τd ~ 34.5 ns), and gently clean all crystal 
surfaces using a noncorrosive material, i.e., isopropanol, and 
let it dry. 
2. Apply a reﬂective material to the crystal surface (except to the 
face in contact to the photodetector), avoiding the generation 
of air bubbles or the inclusion of dust. The reﬂective material 
has to be previously tested to ensure optimal performance 
[64]. In our design, we are using reﬂective white paints. 
3. Gently clean the photodetector elements and apply an optical 
coupling media. For our evaluation, we connected an array of 
7 SiPMs (3 × 3  mm2 active area, J-Series from SensL) to a

custom-designed RF board, using optical grease (BC-630,
Saint-Gobain) as coupling media.

acquisitions 
4. Couple the scintillator to the photodetector ensuring perfect 
alignment; this step is critical to achieve good CTR perfor-
mance. It may be convenient to use a microscope to guarantee 
perfect alignment of the components. Traditionally, the scintil-
lator elements were connected to the photodetectors by their 
end. However, in our setup, we are using a novel side-readout 
approach, as depicted in Fig. 9a, that has proven to provide 
high performance when using high aspect ratio scintillators 
(i.e., >20 mm long), such as the ones required to provide 
high sensitivity in the ﬁnal scanner [66]. 
5. Connect the photodetector board to the data acquisition sys-
tem. The standard output of the SiPMs was connected to a 
digital oscilloscope, and waveforms were acquired placing dif-
ferent non-collimated sources between the two detector ele-
ments; see Fig. 9b. Energy histograms are generated using a 
single time-over-threshold (ToT) circuit [76] in which the 
energy value associated with an event is calculated as the ampli-
tude of the signal above a certain threshold value (previously 
optimized). 
6. The “fast outputs” of the SiPMs are connected to a high-
bandwidth monolithic RF ampliﬁer (MAR-6+, Minicircuits) 
and used as the timing signal as shown in the schematic in 
Fig. 9c. Waveforms are acquired placing a non-collimated 
22 Na source between the detectors. The ampliﬁed timing signal 
is fed into the digital oscilloscope, and leading threshold (LED) 
method is applied (in MATLAB) on the rising edge of the 
digitized scintillation pulse for timing pickoff (Fig. 10a).

method after correcting baseline shifts, and (c) example of the achieved CTR performance using two PET 
detector elements as the one described in the methodology as a function of SiPM bias voltage [65] 
Before applying the LED technique, a baseline correction is 
also applied to deﬁne a reference point for all threshold levels 
among coincidence signals (Fig. 10b). 
7. For energy measurements, different isotopes are used to cali-
brate the detector response into keV units. Once calibrated, the 
energy resolution is calculated as ΔE/E using the 511 keV 
photopeak measured using the 22 Na source. Single measure-
ments are also acquired to conﬁrm linearity by calculating the 
ratio of the second (1024 keV) and ﬁrst (511 keV) 22 Na peaks. 
8. For CTR evaluation, the time difference between the time 
stamps of the two detector elements involved in the coinci-
dence is computed, and a histogram is generated. The FWHM 
of the time difference proﬁle is considered as the CTR of the 
detector pair [65]. It is usual to select events with amplitudes 
that fall within the FWTM of the 511 keV photopeak to avoid 
undesired scattered events that worsen the average CTR. 
Figure 10c shows an example of the CTR values achieved 
using 
the 
described 
methodology 
for 
a 
pair 
of 
3 × 3 × 10 mm3 LGSO crystals, as a function of different 
SiPM bias voltages. 
9. Repeat steps 1–8 several times to account for variances. Each 
time the experiments are repeated, both the crystals and pho-
todetector have to be cleaned and recoupled. The temperature 
is also monitored during the acquisitions to account for possi-
ble ﬂuctuations. 
Note that in this evaluation we are using a digital scope to avoid 
including the electronic chain noise, so we characterize only the 
detector element (ground-truth measurements). Next steps are 
therefore to characterize the DAQ system, in our case, a time to 
digital converters (TDC)-FPGA, with very precise timing informa-
tion (low jitter). To do so, the output signal of the SiPMs is 
connected to the FPGA using a custom-designed add-on board.

The results are compared with the ones obtained following 
steps 1–8.

PET System 
Evaluation 
Once the PET scanner has been assembled, several parameters are 
evaluated following protocols developed to provide fair compari-
sons between different scanners. These protocols are summarized 
in the NEMA Standards Publication (Performance Measurements 
of Positron Emission Tomographs [PET]) published by the 
National Electrical Manufacturers Association [72]. A brief descrip-
tion of the NEMA protocol for the evaluation of PET systems is 
outlined below: 
1. Spatial resolution, measured in the axial direction and in two 
directions of the transverse slice (e.g., radially and tangentially) 
using 18 F or  22 Na sources located at six points across the FOV. 
Acquisitions are reconstructed using the ﬁltered-back-projec-
tion (FBP) algorithm [73]. The spatial resolution is deter-
mined as the FWHM and FWTM of the reconstructed source 
proﬁles; see Fig. 11a. 
2. Scatter fraction, count losses, and random coincidences are 
used to evaluate the system’s ability to mitigate background 
coincidence events as well as measure high activity within the 
system FOV. Acquisitions are performed using a cylinder phan-
tom with a drilled hole parallel to the central axis (see Fig. 11b 
[bottom]), ﬁlled with a high activity tracer, and measurements 
are acquired until the isotope has completely decayed. The 
Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR) is estimated by plotting 
the measured coincidence count rate vs the activity concentra-
tion [74], Fig. 11b (top).

phantom insert with hollow spheres, (c) sketch of the determination of LOR distance from a line source 
3. Sensitivity evaluates the scanner’s coincidence photon detec-
tion efﬁciency and is expressed as the true coincidence events 
detected versus source strength. 18 F mixed with water is used 
to ﬁll the sensitivity phantom which comprises ﬁve concentric 
aluminum tubes, all 700 mm in length. The innermost tubes 
are ﬁllable polyethylene tubes with inner diameters of 3.9, 7.0, 
10.2, 13.4, and 16.6 mm and outer diameters of 6.4, 9.5, 12.7, 
15.9, and 19.2 mm (Fig. 11c). Successive measurements are 
performed with the line source surrounded by known absor-
bers, until arriving at an attenuation-free measurement which is 
used to also extrapolate the sensitivity with no absorber. 
4. To obtain quantitative measurements of source activity distri-
butions under widely varying conditions, PET usually compen-
sates for dead time losses and random events [75]. The 
accuracy of these corrections is evaluated by using a body 
phantom (Fig. 12a) reconstructed applying corrections used 
for total body PET imaging. 
5. Images simulating those that would be acquired in a total body 
study are generated using a phantom with hot lesions to deter-
mine image quality and for accuracy corrections. The imaging 
phantom consists of a body phantom, six spheres ﬁlled with 
18 F, a cylindrical insert ﬁlled with low atomic material to simu-
late lung attenuation, and a test line source in a polyethylene 
cylinder 
for 
scatter 
fraction 
count 
losses 
and 
randoms 
(Fig. 12b). Data are collected and reconstructed using the 
standard parameters for total body imaging (e.g., image matrix 
size, pixel size, slice thickness, ﬁlters, etc.) as recommended by 
the manufacturer. For data analysis, a transverse image centered

PET System Technology
365
on the hot spheres is used, and ROIs are drawn both at the 
center of each reconstructed sphere and in the background of 
the phantom at different positions, and the contrast ratio is 
estimated. 
6. CTR measurement is performed by analyzing the spread of the 
line source in TOF dimension using the same phantom as for 
the scatter fraction evaluation. The measured timing difference 
for each coincidence event used in the TOF measurement is 
corrected by its expected value based on the measured geome-
try of the phantom ﬁlled with 18 F. For each coincidence event 
in the dataset, the timing difference error is computed as the 
distance between the detected locations of the coincidence 
photons in the PET coordinate system and the true location; 
see Fig. 12c. Each event is accumulated into a 2D histogram, 
and the TOF resolution is estimated as the FWHM of the 
proﬁle. 
To assess PET-CT coregistration accuracy, the alignment 
between PET and CT images is evaluated by using ﬁducial markers 
in the images at six know positions. The coregistration error is 
determined by calculating the distance between the centroids of 
the markers between the PET and CT image.

Future Prospective of PET Imaging and Clinical Translation of Novel 
Instrumentation 
During the last decades, PET imaging has emerged as the clinical 
molecular imaging technique of choice, especially for evaluating 
cancer, and constitutes one of the main diagnostic tools used 
clinically to generate patient-speciﬁc images that yield tailored 
diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic information. However, 
present available commercial PET scanners still offer limited spatial 
resolution (~4 mm at the system center) and have relatively low 
sensitivity. Thus, to further extend its clinical and research applica-
tions, technological improvements in PET instrumentation are 
required. Toward improving PET detector performance, it has 
been proposed to use enhanced scintillators [77] (i.e., photonic 
crystals, metamaterials, improved reﬂectors, etc.) in combination 
with high efﬁciency and compact SiPMs and accurate 3D position-
ing algorithms (to address DOI-related problems and boost spatial 
resolution toward the edges of the scanner FOV). In this regard, 
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been proposed and 
tested as methods to achieve homogeneous sub-millimetric resolu-
tion in the entire FOV [78, 79]. 
Enhancing detector performance, in particular CTR, may help 
to overcome the low sensitivity problem, since information regard-
ing the photon arrival time to the detector could be included

during the reconstruction process. High-resolution TOF-PET 
imaging would allow for real-time access to dynamic information, 
one order of magnitude sensitivity increase, and corresponding 
dose reduction [80]. A main challenge associated to the translation 
of TOF-PET technology to full scanners is the multiplexing of the 
large number of SiPMs composing the detectors that deteriorates 
CTR. TOF-PET technology has been one of the main lines of 
research in PET instrumentation during the last year, and the best 
state-of-the-art scanners already reach ~214 ps FWHM CTR 
[24]. Another approach to boost system sensitivity is building 
large axial FOV scanners. Following this idea, the ﬁrst total body 
scanner was recently developed, the so-called EXPLORER, with 
195 cm total axial FOV, which allows one to reduce scanning time 
to seconds [28]. However, its high price and the requirement for 
large hospital footprints is a challenge for its clinical deployment as 
well as research use. 
366
Andrea Gonzalez-Montoro and Craig S. Levin
Additionally, beyond instrumentation challenges, to further 
extend the clinical use of PET, it is important to consider that, 
while PET provides highly quantitative images for the study of 
biochemical and functional abnormalities, the absence of back-
ground anatomical information makes it difﬁcult to interpret the 
radiotracer distribution, leading sometimes to misinterpretations of 
the images. To deal with this problem, PET functional images are 
coregistered with anatomical images provided by CT or MRI 
systems [81].

Abstract 
The world’s ﬁrst total-body PET/CT system has been in routine clinical and research use at UC Davis since 
2019. The uEXPLORER total-body PET scanner has been designed with an axial ﬁeld-of-view long 
enough to completely encompass most human subjects (194 cm or 76 inches long), allowing for a 
15–68-fold gain in the PET signal collection efﬁciency over conventional PET scanners. A high-sensitivity 
PET scanner that can image the entire subject with a single bed position comes with new beneﬁts 
and challenges to consider for efﬁcient and practical use. In this chapter, we discuss the common clinical 
and research imaging protocols implemented at our institution, along with the appropriate technical and 
practical considerations of total-body PET imaging.

Introduction 
The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and United Imag-
ing Healthcare (UIH) have collaborated to develop the world’s ﬁrst 
total-body PET scanner. The uEXPLORER PET/CT scanner has 
an axial ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 194.0 cm, allowing PET data col-
lection from the entire human body simultaneously and greatly 
increasing PET scanner signal collection efﬁciency. The uEX-
PLORER scanner was installed at the EXPLORER Molecular 
Imaging Center (EMIC) in May 2019 and has been operational 
since June 2019 (Fig. 1). 
Developed under an NCI-funded transformative award (R01 
CA206187, $15.5 M direct costs), the EXPLORER total-body 
PET/CT scanner marks a paradigm shift in the capabilities of 
PET imaging in humans. The 194 cm long PET scanner is the 
ﬁrst imaging device that can image the entire human body

simultaneously and is one of the most complex imaging devices in 
the world, with over 500,000 individual detectors, and dataset sizes 
that commonly exceed 1 TB. In contrast to conventional PET 
scanners, which have a ~ 20–30 cm axial ﬁeld-of-view (FOV), the 
uEXPLORER can collect signal from the entire human body, lead-
ing to a 15–68-fold gain in detection efﬁciency [1]. Additionally, 
the uEXPLORER scanner was developed with excellent spatial 
resolution of ~3 mm [1], which is better than any existing whole-
body clinical PET scanner. First investigations have shown that the 
ultra-high sensitivity, coupled with high spatial resolution, leads to 
exceptional image quality [2]. uEXPLORER is US FDA 510 
(k) cleared, with several installations across the world where it is 
commonly used for high-throughput imaging in regions with high 
clinical demands [3]. At our institution, this state-of-the-art PET 
scanner is utilized for both novel research applications and clinical 
imaging in which an emphasis has been placed on optimizing image 
quality [4]. There are now multiple vendors selling long (1 m or 
greater) axial ﬁeld-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanners [5], as well as 
other developments in academic labs such as the 140 cm long 
PennPET EXPLORER [6, 7]; thus, the total-body PET clinical 
practices and protocols developed at UC Davis will hopefully set 
the foundations that will guide protocols and usage in future long 
axial ﬁeld-of-view and total-body PET systems that will be installed 
in the coming years.

Practical Considerations for Total-Body PET
373
Initial studies have demonstrated that the uEXPLORER scan-
ner is capable of performing low dose imaging (1/20th standard 
18 F-2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18 F-FDG) dose), late time point 
imaging (imaging 18 F-FDG up to 12 h post-injection), fast imaging 
(20–30 s scan duration), and simultaneous total-body dynamic 
imaging [2]. EXPLORER total-body PET imaging with ultra-fast 
dynamic imaging at 100 ms frame duration has also been reported 
[8]. Ongoing experience with clinical and research imaging on the 
EXPLORER clearly supports the expectation of superior image 
quality provided by the high scanner sensitivity and spatial resolu-
tion compared with conventional PET scanners [4, 9]. 
This chapter will ﬁrst give an overview of the uEXPLORER 
design and performance evaluation, along with the technical con-
siderations related to data collection and image reconstruction, 
which provide guidance for clinical and research applications of 
total-body PET. In the methods section, common clinical and 
research protocols employed at our institution are described and 
justiﬁed. Additionally, some practical considerations speciﬁc to 
total-body PET are discussed.

Materials 
2.1 
The uEXPLORER 
Total-Body PET/CT 
Scanner 
The characterization and performance evaluation of the uEX-
PLORER total-body PET scanner has been reported in [1]. The 
work reports measurements of PET scanner sensitivity, spatial reso-
lution, count-rate performance, time-of-ﬂight (TOF) resolution, 
and image quality, according to the national electrical manufac-
turers association (NEMA) NU 2-2018 standard along with addi-
tional measurements required to fully characterize long axial FOV 
PET scanners. 
The uEXPLORER uses lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate 
(LYSO) scintillation crystals (2.76 × 2.76 × 18.1 mm3 ) coupled 
to silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors to detect coincidence 
photons emitted from positron annihilations. The PET system has a 
bore diameter of 78.6 cm and an axial length of 194.0 cm separated 
into eight units of equal length. Each unit can form coincidences 
with itself and ± 4 adjacent units on either side, entailing an axial 
acceptance angle of up to 57 degrees. This creates a sensitivity 
proﬁle in which the central 1 m of axial length has a plateau of 
high sensitivity, making it optimal for imaging the vital organs of 
the human body (vertex to pelvis) while still providing diagnostic 
quality imaging of the extremities in a single acquisition. This 
provides a peak sensitivity of 18.6% within the central 1 m and an 
average sensitivity for adult total-body imaging of 14.7% (Fig. 2) 
[1]. This equates to a vast improvement in PET scanner sensitivity 
compared to other conventional scanners.

line source phantoms. Sinogram slice thickness is 1.444 mm. (Reproduced from 
Ref. [1] with permission from Journal of Nuclear Medicine) 
Although total-body PET is known for its high sensitivity, the 
uEXPLORER PET scanner also has the highest spatial resolution of 
any whole-body clinical PET scanner of 3.0 mm measured accord-
ing to NEMA NU 2 and with the ability to resolve 2.4 mm rods in a 
mini-Derenzo phantom using iterative reconstruction [1]. Utiliza-
tion of high spatial resolution in PET imaging requires small voxel 
image reconstruction, which will suffer from increased image noise 
unless supported by a high number of detected events. Therefore, 
the high sensitivity provided by total-body PET is well complemen-
ted by high spatial resolution, enabling exceptional image quality in 
most applications. 
2.2 
uEXPLORER Data 
Corrections, Dynamic 
Range, and 
Quantitative Accuracy 
The high sensitivity of total-body PETenables improved imaging at 
a very low dose in clinical and research applications, such as ultra-
low dose pediatric imaging, ultra-low dose repeat imaging in 
healthy subjects or subjects with chronic conditions [10], and 
potentially oncology screening [2].

Practical Considerations for Total-Body PET

with ~19 MBq 89 Zr-Df-Crefmirlimab and scanned 48 hours after infusion. This 
89 Zr-labeled mini body is a marker of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Images were 
reconstructed with 1.17 mm isotropic voxel size and 60 min duration 
Total-body or LAFOV PET can also be utilized for improved 
imaging of low positron yield tracers such as 89 Zr VRC01 [11]  or  
therapy agents such as 90 Y. For example, total-body immunoPET 
imaging of 89 Zr-labeled antibodies using only an 18.5 MBq admin-
istration of the 22% positron fraction tracer provides exceptional 
image quality as seen in Fig. 3. Dosimetry veriﬁcation of therapeu-
tic doses of 90 Y is enabled with total-body PET imaging of the 
0.003% positron yield of 90 Y  [12]. Imaging of a therapeutic dose of 
90 Y is equivalent to imaging ~80 kBq of positron activity, or 2.3 μCi 
of 18 F-FDG [12]. Additionally, the total-body coverage may be 
used for new research applications such as high-temporal resolution 
total-body dynamic imaging [8, 13, 14], or improved whole-body 
clinical 
scanning 
of 
tracers 
with 
fast 
kinetics 
such 
as 
18 F-Fluciclovine [9].

Fig. 4 Range of count rates encountered by the uEXPLORER scanner (throughout the acquisition) in various 
clinical and research tasks. The count rates were estimated based on the NEMA NU 2–2018 NECR 
performance assessment using an extended, 175 cm NU 2 scatter phantom. Note: the activity at peak 
NECR is 528 MBq. (p.i. = post-injection). (Reproduced from Ref. [16] with permission) 
A PET scanner, which enables imaging applications of tracer 
activity from as low as 80 kBq (effective positron activity) up to 
370 MBq (~4500-fold range), presents a unique challenge in 
quantitative molecular imaging. This requires accurate data correc-
tions and image reconstruction over a wide signal dynamic range. 
For very low dose applications, the LYSO background correction 
must be properly accounted for to allow accurate imaging 
[15]. Additionally, issues such as the non-negativity constraint in 
iterative reconstruction must be considered [16]. As activity 
increases the number of trues increase, whereas the number of 
randoms increase with the square of activity. Furthermore, because 
the PET detectors are limited by how fast they can record events, as 
activity increases detector deadtime losses will increasingly become 
a factor. This count-rate behavior is captured in the noise equivalent 
count rate (NECR) plots shown in Fig. 4, which also illustrates the 
activity ranges of some typical clinical and research protocols. A 
more in-depth analysis is presented in Spencer et al. [1], where the 
NECR is presented for both a 70 cm-long phantom (following the 
NEMA protocol for conventional PET scanners) and a 175 cm-
long phantom. The 70 cm phantom can provide an approximation 
for the count-rate behavior for single-organ imaging using total-
body or LAFOV scanners, while the 175 cm phantom more appro-
priately illustrates the optimal count-rate regime when imaging 
tracer distribution within the entire human body. 
The accuracy of data corrections subsequently translates to 
quantitatively accurate imaging, which is an essential paradigm of 
PET imaging [17]. In the case of total-body PET, not only is

quantitative accuracy required over a very large activity range, but 
consistent quantitative accuracy is sought over the entire axial FOV. 
The investigation by Leung et al. [16] provides the ﬁrst evaluation 
of quantitative accuracy in a total-body PET scanner over a clinically 
relevant range of activities representative of total-body PET. This 
study demonstrated that the uEXPLORER quantitative accuracy 
was between ±3% following the NEMA NU-2 protocol utilizing a 
70 cm phantom, and ± 4% accuracy was obtained with a human-
sized 175 cm phantom [16]. In addition, this study revealed that 
the uEXPLORER axial uniformity fell within ±3% across the central 
175 cm (90%) of the axial FOV. This prior work provides the 
necessary validation of the uEXPLORER total-body PET scanner 
for a wide range of clinical and research applications. 
Practical Considerations for Total-Body PET

2.3 
uEXPLORER 
Image Reconstruction 
PET image reconstruction is achieved using a listmode based time-
of-ﬂight (TOF) enabled ordered-subset expectation-maximization 
(OSEM) iterative reconstruction algorithm. The image reconstruc-
tion allows for incorporation of detector normalization factors, 
deadtime correction, randoms correction, TOF, attenuation cor-
rection, Monte Carlo–based scatter correction, and point spread 
function (PSF) resolution modeling. Along with the correction 
factors, image pixel size, slice thickness, number of subsets, number 
of iterations, and optional image smoothing can be speciﬁed by the 
user. In addition, the vendor-provided software allows for limited 
axial FOV image reconstruction and dynamic framing. 
Our institution’s commonly used total-body PET image recon-
struction protocols are provided in Table 1. Contrary to most 
conventional PET reconstruction protocols, total-body PET 
image 
reconstruction 
commonly 
does 
not 
require 
post-
reconstruction image smoothing. Given that total-body PET 
image reconstruction times can be lengthy (see Table 2) and are 
dependent on the reconstruction voxel size, generally image noise 
can be reduced by employing larger voxel image reconstruction 
rather than applying post-reconstruction smoothing as seen in the 
low-resolution reconstruction protocol and high-temporal resolu-
tion (2 s frames) dynamic imaging protocol. Larger voxel recon-
structions 
provide 
noise 
reduction 
as 
well 
as 
increased 
reconstruction speed with the added beneﬁt that the image data 
sets become more manageable for image viewing and further image 
processing such as tracer kinetic modeling. 
2.4 
Practical 
Consideration for 
Total-Body PET Data 
Collection and 
Reconstruction 
Last but not least, the practical considerations of total-body or 
LAFOV PET imaging must be considered for viable clinical and 
research applications. For the uEXPLORER PET scanner, the 
~eightfold increase in the axial length leads to a large increase in 
the number of possible lines-of-response (LOR), and thus the raw 
PET data size increases substantially. The acquired raw data is 
stored in listmode format after energy window discrimination and

coincidence processing on the vendor provided 8-node computa-
tional cluster. Raw data sizes can become larger than 1 TB for some 
research applications, such as a 370 MBq 60 minute dynamic 
acquisition, as shown in Table 2. The raw data produced with 
clinical imaging protocols is manageable in comparison (see 
Table 2), although the size is still about two orders of magnitude 
greater compared to conventional PET. Long-term storage of raw 
data is only required if reprocessing or additional reconstructions 
are needed, so for most clinical applications, storage of raw data for 
more than 1 week is typically not necessary.

Sinogram generation becomes unfeasible for total-body PET 
imaging with up to 92 billion LORs, especially with the incorpora-
tion of more than 60 TOF bins. As a result, listmode image recon-
struction methods are required for any high-resolution total-body 
PET applications. The time it takes to go from data acquisition to 
image generation is due to a combination of several tasks including 
data pre-processing, Monte Carlo scatter correction, image recon-
struction, and DICOM image generation. The duration of these 
tasks is, for the most part, heavily dependent on the number of 
events recorded (product of activity and scan duration, bearing in 
mind radioactive decay), but also vary based on the selected image 
reconstruction parameters—most notably, the number of recon-
struction iterations and the image voxel size. Consequently, the 
reconstruction time is mostly determined by the clinical or research

imaging protocol and the image reconstruction parameters. Exam-
ples of typical reconstruction durations are given in Table 2; how-
ever, these times also vary with factors such as the size of the 
subject, which inﬂuence the number of detected events.

In conclusion, image reconstruction time must be considered if 
high-throughput clinical imaging is desired, although this can be 
readily controlled with careful consideration of the imaging proto-
col and reconstruction parameters. On the other hand, research

protocols such as high-temporal resolution dynamic imaging 
would be greatly aided with the addition of a separate or dual 
image reconstruction cluster. If storage of raw data is needed for 
future reprocessing or research applications, a petabyte scale stor-
age solution is necessary.

Methods 
The objective of this section is to describe common total-body PET 
protocols in use at our institution and discuss some practical con-
siderations, which should be taken into account for effective total-
body PET imaging in both the clinical and research settings. 
Clinical implementation of total-body PET at our institution 
was designed to increase the beneﬁt to the individual patient rather 
than just employing it as a high-throughput standard-of-care PET 
scanner. The goal was to reduce the injected dose and therefore the 
radiation dose to the patient moderately while simultaneously sub-
stantially improving the image quality. For all standard 18 F-FDG 
clinical protocols, the injected dose was reduced by 20% leading to a 
PET dose, which is similar or less than the dose from the accom-
panying CT (equivalent to ~1.8 times the average annual back-
ground radiation dose in the USA [18]). 
To improve image quality, we scan for a similar duration as a 
typical multi-bed position whole-body scan: a total of 20 min of 
scan duration. Additionally, we aim to increase tumor to back-
ground ratio in oncologic 18 F-FDG imaging by doubling the con-
ventional uptake time of the tracer from 60 min post-injection to 
120 min post-injection. An additional 60 min of uptake results in 
further radiotracer decay of ~30%, but according to the total-body 
PET clinical experience at UCD, the improvements in image qual-
ity and lesion detection outweigh the signal loss resulting in a 
favorable trade-off. 
The number of total-body PET research applications and pro-
tocols is too numerous and application speciﬁc to describe in detail. 
However, standard dynamic PET imaging protocols currently in 
use and some practical considerations are outlined below. 
3.1 
Quality Control 
and Assurance 
Procedures for the 
uEXPLORER Total-
Body PET/CT System 
Following 
the 
manufacturer’s 
recommendations, 
the 
uEX-
PLORER undergoes preventative maintenance and system calibra-
tion every 6 months. In the interim, daily and weekly quality 
control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures are performed 
to ensure the system is operating properly and accurately. The 
manufacturer recommends daily and weekly QC procedures for 
both PET and CT systems. In addition to those, our institution 
performs our own weekly QA protocol developed to verify quanti-
tative accuracy along the 194 cm axial FOV and monitor any 
temporal changes in quantitative performance over months to 
years [19].

and body compartments. (b) The PET weekly quality control phantom. (c) The uniform cylinder phantom, which 
is scanned at three axial locations for quality assurance 
The weekly CT QC procedure utilizes a water-ﬁlled phantom 
with body and head compartments (Fig. 5a). This phantom is 
attached to the end of the patient table and scanned for approxi-
mately 5 min. The procedure checks for image noise, quantitative 
accuracy (i.e., CT number), uniformity, resolution, and checks for 
the presence of any CT artifacts. The daily QC procedure involves 
CT air calibration and does not require a phantom. At our institu-
tion, we perform both daily and weekly QC procedures every day of 
scanning. The manufacturer-recommended PET weekly QC pro-
cedure requires a radioactive cylinder source of 52 cm length and 
5 cm diameter, which is positioned in the scanner and stepped 
through the entire axial FOV (Fig. 5b). The radioactive source 
employed can be either a solid Ge-68 uniform phantom, or a 
cylinder phantom provided by the manufacturer that can be ﬁlled 
with a uniform radioactive solution. The source strength should be 
in the range of 37–111 MBq. The weekly QC procedure collects 
data from two units at a time with a variable acquisition duration 
from 15 to 40 min depending on the source strength. This ensures 
sufﬁcient count density to perform all QC assessments. The man-
ufacturer’s QC protocol examines the PET calibration crystal map 
and look up table, the detector energy drift, the time-of-ﬂight 
status, the detector voltage, temperature, and humidity to verify 
conditions are within operational standards. In addition, the man-
ufacturer’s daily quick QC procedure utilizes the background 
count rate of the scanner (arising from the presence of small 
amounts of radioactive 176 Lu in the detectors themselves) to verify 
the state of the PET electronics and detectors. This daily QC can be 
scheduled to run automatically during off hours and provides 
information of the detector voltage, temperature, humidity, and 
background count rates. This daily QC can be performed in about 
60 s and automatically veriﬁes the scanner is operational. 
At our institution, we designed a secondary QA procedure to 
ascertain the axial quantitative uniformity and monitor the tempo-
ral quantitative performance of the scanner. This QA procedure is

performed weekly, although the frequency could be modiﬁed to 
meet institution-speciﬁc needs. The QA evaluation utilizes a stan-
dard uniform Ge-68 cylindrical phantom with 30 cm length, 20 cm 
diameter, and 37–74 MBq activity (Fig. 5c) [19]. This phantom is 
positioned on the patient bed and scanned at three positions along 
the axial FOV for 5 min duration at each position [19]. The images 
are reconstructed following our standard clinical protocol for anal-
ysis. A 10 cm diameter circular region of interest is placed approxi-
mately at the center of the phantom, and the SUV is recorded for 
each position and repeated every week. This provides both axial and 
temporal monitoring of the quantitative accuracy with an in-house 
designed protocol. Temporal monitoring can reveal changes, which 
occur between semi-annual calibrations as well as indicate if any 
changes occurred due to the semi-annual calibration by comparing 
the weekly QA before and after calibration. QA measurements over 
1 year of observations have shown a small drift in SUV ranging 
from +1% to -3% and consistent axial uniformity within 2%.

Clinical Total-
Body PET/CT Imaging 
Adult 
18 F-FDG is used for the assessment of abnormal glucose metabo-
lism to assist in the evaluation of malignancy in patients with known 
or suspected abnormalities found by other testing modalities, or in 
patients with an existing diagnosis of cancer. 18 F-FDG is the most 
widely used radiotracer for clinical patients on the total-body uEX-
PLORER PET/CT scanner. Patients are required to fast for a 
minimum of 6 hours prior to the injection and must withhold 
exercise for at least 24 h prior. Oral hydration is encouraged. 
Transport of 18 F-FDG into cells may be affected by fasting or by 
blood glucose changes associated with diabetes mellitus. Restric-
tions on diabetic medications vary depending on the category and 
mechanism of action, but the restricted duration ranges from 4 to 
24 h prior to injection. Prior to injection, patients’ blood glucose is 
tested using the standard ﬁngerstick method. Non-diabetic patients 
should have a fasting blood glucose of 150 mg/dL or less prior 
to18 F-FDG injection. Diabetic patients should have a fasting blood 
glucose of 200 mg/dL or less prior to [18]F-FDG injection. At our 
institution, adult clinical patients receive a standard dose of 
296 MBq 18 F-FDG. Pediatric patients receive weight-based dosing 
of 4.07 MBq/kg of 18 F-FDG with a maximum dose of 296 MBq. 
Once patients have been injected, they sit quietly in a dimly lit 
room. Uptake times are dependent upon diagnosis. All patients 
are asked to void their bladder prior to imaging. 
Non-lymphoma patients are imaged for 20 min after a 120 min 
uptake period for improved lesion detection and tracer clearance 
from blood or background tissue. Patients receive a low dose CT 
(140 kV, average 50 mAs) just prior to PET acquisition. Patients 
with a diagnosis of lymphoma are imaged for 20 min after a 60 min 
uptake period, in order to comply with the Deauville scale used by 
physicians for staging and assessment of treatment in lymphoma

patients, and then again at 120 min post-injection. These patients 
have a low dose CT with the 60 min PET and an ultra-low dose CT 
(140 kV, average 5 mAs) with the 120 min PET. See Table 3 for 
summary of the standard clinical protocols. 
Practical Considerations for Total-Body PET
383
For clinical diagnoses other than head/neck cancer or where 
PET imaging of the entire body is indicated (e.g., melanoma, 
multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma, soft tissue sarcomas), patients 
are positioned supine on the imaging table with arms above the 
head in order to reduce attenuation in the torso. Patients who are 
being evaluated for head/neck cancer or where entire body imag-
ing is indicated are positioned supine on the table and imaged with 
arms down and stacked across the abdomen to minimize streak 
artifacts in the torso. Care is taken to ensure the site of disease is 
within the FOV. 
68 Ga-Dotatate PET/CT imaging is useful for evaluating pri-
mary and metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. 
The standard dose range for 68 Ga-Dotatate is 101.4–166.5 MBq. 
If patients are receiving any somatostatin analog treatments, 68 Ga-
Dotatate 
imaging 
must 
be 
scheduled 
accordingly 
as 
non-radioactive somatostatin analogs competitively bind to the 
same somatostatin receptors as 68 Ga-Dotatate. Short-acting ana-
logs of somatostatin should be held at least 24 h prior to imaging 
with 68 Ga-Dotatate. Patients receiving long-acting somatostatin 
analogs should ideally be imaged with 68 Ga-Dotatate just prior to 
their dosing of somatostatin (same day or 24 h prior). The standard 
uptake time for 68 Ga-Dotatate imaging is 60 min followed by a low 
dose CT (140 kV, average 5 mAs) and a 20 min PET acquisition. 
18 F-Fluciclovine imaging is indicated in men with suspected 
prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated blood prostate-
speciﬁc antigen (PSA) levels following prior treatment. Patients 
are required to fast for a minimum of 4 hours prior to the injection 
and must withhold exercise for at least 24 h prior. Oral hydration is 
encouraged. It is preferable to start an intravenous catheter (IV) in 
the right upper extremity to avoid potential uptake in the supracla-
vicular vein as seen with left upper extremity injections. Patients are 
positioned on the scanner with arms stacked over the abdomen. 
Prior to injection, patients receive a low dose CT (140 kV, average 
50 mAs). A dynamic PET acquisition commences at the start of the 
injection and is acquired for 25 min. FDA guidelines advise PET 
imaging to commence 4 min post-injection; in accordance, our 
institution reconstructs various static images from the dynamic 
dataset to provide diagnostic quality imaging at various stages of 
physiologic uptake. As recommended by the FDA, the standard 
dose of 18 F-Fluciclovine for adult patients is 370 MBq ± 20%; 
however, 
our 
institution 
aims 
for 
an 
injected 
dose 
of 
296–333 MBq within the -20% allowed variation by the 
manufacturer.

Patient or 
Research Participant 
Axial Positioning in 
Total-Body PET 
While the uEXPLORER with its 194 cm axial FOV has the capabil-
ity to image the entire length of an average-sized adult, patient 
position within the scanner may be varied according to diagnosis or 
area of interest taking into consideration the sensitivity proﬁle of 
the scanner (Fig. 6). 
For clinical patient imaging when the priority is to include as 
much of the entire body as possible, such as with melanoma or 
multiple myeloma, the entire PET FOV is utilized ensuring the 
patient’s vertex of skull to toes are included within the FOV. Care 
must be taken with the subset of patients with a height close to or 
greater than 194 cm to include the site(s) of interest; however, in 
such cases, it is typically possible to position the subject with their 
knees bent and elevated to ensure their entire body is within the 
axial FOV (see Fig. 7). If a physician has requested a conventional 
PET scan (to include the regions between the skull and mid-thigh), 
the patient is positioned with the skull vertex at the top of the 
second unit of detector modules, 24 cm from the axial end of the 
PET detectors (see Fig. 6a). For the average adult, the imaging 
FOV would then include vertex of skull to distal tibia. 
Research participant placement varies depending on the 
research goals of the study. For many total-body dynamic studies, 
the participant is placed in the center of the FOV to allow total-
body kinetic modeling and parametric imaging [13] while also 
obtaining a total-body ROI-derived quantitative accuracy estimate 
[16]. In many other studies, the region of primary interest (e.g., 
brain) would be positioned closer to the center of the FOV to 
achieve the highest sensitivity (see Fig. 6c).

3.4 
Pediatric Total-
Body PET Imaging 
The increased sensitivity of total-body PET has perhaps the greatest 
beneﬁt to clinical care in pediatric imaging. The pediatric popula-
tion is of course particularly sensitive to radiation and even more 
susceptible to patient motion during imaging. In practice, total-
body PET allows for the reduction of imaging times and/or the 
potential 
for 
further 
dose 
reduction 
without 
signiﬁcantly 
compromising image quality. 
To optimize pediatric patient care, precision imaging protocols 
can be utilized with total-body PET. Prior to imaging, each

pediatric patient can be assessed and designated with a tranquility 
score to determine the scan duration and pediatric dosing scale for 
each individual patient [20]. The tranquility score is based upon a 
child’s capacity to cooperate to either reduce scan time (to avoid 
general anesthesia) or reduce the dose below SNMMI standards. As 
seen in Table 4, the tranquility scoring system uses a scale from 1 to 
4, with 1 requiring anesthesia and 4 indicating the patient can 
cooperate for a full 20 min acquisition. A dose reduction propor-
tional to the acceptable scan time reduction can be applied to 
pediatric patients who can tolerate longer scan durations.

Due to technical limitations, our facility cannot administer 
anesthesia; however, with the sensitivity provided by this state-of-
the-art scanner, we can substantially reduce scan acquisition time to 
reduce the number of cases where anesthesia would be required. 
Furthermore, with total-body coverage and listmode data acquisi-
tion, the ﬂexibility to identify, separate, and reconstruct relatively 
motion-free time periods is possible with careful monitoring. For 
example, if a pediatric patient can tolerate a scan but is susceptible 
to motion during the scan, the PET data can be acquired for a long 
duration while monitoring patient motion. The data used for image 
reconstruction can then be speciﬁcally selected and reconstructed 
to provide a reconstructed frame with relatively low motion and 
diagnostic image quality provided by the high sensitivity. Data can 
be selected (1) by technicians observing the patient and only 
reconstructing the scan time in which the patient was compliant; 
(2) through the monitoring of real-time count rates of the entire

scanner and each ring individually; and (3) by reconstructing the 
entire scan with short frames (e.g., 15 s) and by manually reviewing 
each frame for gross motion. In practice, only the ﬁrst method 
would be used for clinical purposes.

3.5 
Considerations 
for Dynamic Total-
Body PET Imaging 
The uEXPLORER has the capability to acquire total-body dynamic 
studies. This allows total-body radiotracer biodistribution to be 
visualized as a function of time across the entire duration of the 
acquisition. Total-body dynamic studies require special considera-
tions not normally encountered with static imaging or even single-
organ dynamic imaging [21]. A total-body PET/CT scanner has a 
much larger axial FOV than a conventional scanner. Injection 
technique and length of tubing must be considered, along with 
length of scan, arm positioning, and patient cooperation. 
Our institution has developed a bolus injection technique 
aimed at delivering the most concentrated bolus possible while 
limiting the amount of residual activity remaining in the injection 
syringe and tubing. A 22 g IV or larger is placed in the upper 
extremity of each patient. If possible, IV placement should be 
superior to or in the antecubital region. IV placement inferior to 
the antecubital area leads to a greater likelihood of vessel bifurca-
tion visualized on ﬂow studies, and the potential of a dual time 
activity curve (TAC). A 1.5 mL microbore extension tube is added 
to the IVand positioned with the distal tip extended to the superior 
FOV limit for ease of access for the technologist. After completion 
of the CT scan, the technologist connects a three-way stop valve 
and a saline ﬂush to the extension tube. The dose syringe is then 
connected to the remaining port on the three-way connection. If 
the volume of the dose is less than 1.5 mL, or the volume the 
extension tube can hold, the extension tube is pre-loaded with the 
dose. We then use a saline ﬂush into the dose syringe to rinse any 
residual activity. The PET acquisition is started just prior to inject-
ing the dose syringe to the patient, and then the saline is immedi-
ately ﬂushed directly to the patient. This method delivers the most 
concentrated bolus, reduces residual in the dose syringe, and 
ensures the extension tube is ﬂushed appropriately. 
When deciding on the duration of a dynamic PET scan, areas of 
most interest and patient ability to withstand positioning require-
ments must be taken into consideration. For studies that would 
beneﬁt most from longer scan durations (60 min or longer) or have 
areas of interest that would not be hindered from arms positioned 
down in the ﬁeld-of-view (brain or lower extremities), patients are 
positioned with arms down for comfort. If it is determined that 
arms should be positioned up above the head for image quality, 
scan duration is, where possible, limited to 30 min for improved 
patient compliance.

Methods to 
Reduce or Correct 
Patient Motion in 
Total-Body PET 
Patient comfort during scanning is of key importance for reducing 
image artifacts resulting from intra-scan motion. Due to its 
increased sensitivity and high spatial resolution, minor motion 
becomes more apparent on total-body PET imaging. Educating 
the patient about the scan process and how movement could nega-
tively impact the images is therefore important. Evaluating the 
patient’s pain level and using positioning devices to decrease dis-
comfort may assist in decreasing motion. To reduce motion in the 
legs and feet, a Velcro strap is usually placed around the patient’s 
feet at the ball of the foot. This allows the patient’s feet to relax yet 
be supported motionless during the scan. In some cases where very 
ﬁne details (i.e., metacarpophalangeal joints) are being evaluated, 
further patient immobilization may be useful [22]. 
The uEXPLORER has available vendor-provided respiratory 
and cardiac gating capabilities. The respiratory gating utilizes a 
compression-sensitive respiration belt, which is attached ﬁrmly to 
the subject’s chest. The cardiac gating uses a three-lead EKG for 
cardiac cycle estimation. The vendor-provided reconstruction soft-
ware then allows ﬂexible incorporation of the gating signals with 
user-deﬁned settings. However, this has not yet been implemented 
into routine clinical or research protocols at our institution. 
At our institution, data-driven methods of motion correction 
have been implemented in a research setting for both respiratory 
and 
cardiac 
motion 
correction, 
with 
promising 
results 
[23, 24]. Data-driven methods of motion correction are especially 
advantageous for high-sensitivity total-body PET and could pro-
vide effective solutions for future clinical and research applications. 
Another future direction for total-body PET motion correction 
may utilize the LYSO background radiation to measure subject 
motion during the PET acquisition, although this may be more 
difﬁcult 
to 
implement 
without 
hardware 
or 
software 
modiﬁcations [25].

Abstract 
Recent technological advances in medical imaging have allowed for both sequential and simultaneous 
acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data. Simul-
taneous PET/MRI offers distinct advantages by efﬁciently capturing functional and metabolic processes 
with co-localized, high-resolution anatomical images while minimizing time and movement. We will 
describe some of the technical and logistic requirements for optimizing sequential and simultaneous 
PET/MRI in the preclinical research setting.

Introduction 
Hybrid imaging refers to technologies that combine two or more 
imaging modalities. PET/CT (computed tomography) has been a 
standard hybrid imaging technique used in both clinical and pre-
clinical studies for many years. Recent technological advances in 
PET hardware, such as photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) incorporat-
ing solid-state systems like avalanche photodiodes (APDs) [1–3] 
and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) [4–9], have not only led to 
next-generation PET systems, but have spurred the development of 
new hybrid imaging tools, particularly PET/MRI [10]. 
MRI is a common clinical modality yielding impressive high-
resolution soft tissue contrast for a number of disease indications 
[11]. However, MRI is not limited to anatomy. MRI offers multi-
faceted image contrast including, but not limited to, diffusion (e.g., 
diffusion tensor imaging or DTI), perfusion, functional MRI, 
T1-shortening, 
and 
chemical 
exchange 
saturation 
transfer, 
providing opportunities for immediate sequential monitoring of

multiple processes in the same subject. While many of those pro-
cesses are often measurable with no external contrast agent, a wide 
range of MRI probes have been developed to further enhance 
possible contrast mechanisms. These probes are non-radioactive, 
stable, easy to transport, readily available, and often used in the 
clinic, and though they have historically suffered from low sensitiv-
ity compared to PET [11], advances in pulse sequence and chemical 
design methodologies have yielded probes that can be used at 
reasonable concentrations in animals and humans.

PET/MRI is creating new opportunities for multiparametric 
analysis with rational probe combinations and advanced imaging 
acquisition workﬂows [12–18]. As detailed elsewhere in this book, 
PET has exquisite sensitivity and an ability to quantify radiotracer 
uptake. PET/MRI can therefore combine radiotracer quantiﬁca-
tion with the multiparametric data obtainable from MRI. Quanti-
tative PET becomes more powerful when combined with MRI, as 
the 
addition 
of 
high-resolution 
anatomical 
data 
allows 
for 
co-localization of radiotracer concentrations to smaller substruc-
tures. It is also possible to look for correlations of radiotracer 
concentrations with other physiological parameters as measured 
by MRI. 
Sequential PET/MRI has been possible for several years and 
requires users to transfer or move samples from the MRI to PET 
scanner (or vice versa) and co-register or perform necessary correc-
tions in post-processing. However, imaging protocols can vary 
signiﬁcantly from lab to lab, and their utility is limited for radio-
isotopes with short half-lives, or for temporally correlating func-
tional/metabolic processes characterized with both MRI and PET 
imaging. Simultaneous PET/MRI does not have these limitations, 
as both scans are acquired at the same time using hardware with a 
common isocenter but requires more advanced imaging equipment 
not available in all labs. 
Here, we will discuss recommended materials and procedures 
for executing both sequential and simultaneous PET/MRI, rang-
ing from pre-scan calibrations to image post-processing. We have 
tested these procedures in a number of oncology imaging studies, 
including both ovarian and cervical cancer models (Fig. 1). 
The 
primary 
choice 
of 
simultaneous 
versus 
sequential 
PET/MRI is based on availability of equipment, that is, an 
integrated PET/MRI system or a PET/MR insert. Currently, 
most preclinical PET inserts for simultaneous PET/MRI use 
SiPMs. SiPMs can be seen as an array of submillimeter APD ele-
ments connected in parallel and operating in Geiger-mode 
[5, 6]. They are considered to be an excellent substitute for 
PMTs. Like a PMT, SiPMs have better signal-to-noise (SNR) and 
timing properties than APDs, but they are insensitive to magnetic 
ﬁeld, which opens their use for PET/MRI. Additionally, SiPMs

have a smaller form factor than conventional PMTs, which has 
distinct advantages for creating physically smaller preclinical imag-
ing systems.

Fig. 1 Sample PET/MRI data from cervical and ovarian cancer studies. Both studies used [18 F]-2-ﬂuorodeox-
yglucose (FDG). Left: C57BL/6 mouse implanted with C3 cervical cancer model in left ﬂank (see Ref. [47] for 
mouse/tumor model/MRI details). Imaging was performed 21 days post-implant. While tumor is easily 
visualized on MRI, PEt allows for monitoring the necrotic core at center of tumor, common in this tumor 
model. Right: HHD mouse implanted with epithelial ovarian cancer cells directly into the ovary (see Ref. [48] 
for details on mouse/tumor model and PET/MRI). Imaging was done 42 days post-implant. This orthotopic 
tumor model is difﬁcult to visualize with MRI alone, but it is easily localized with the addition of PET 
Simultaneous PET/MRI is preferred for a number of reasons. 
The workﬂow for simultaneous PET/MRI is much easier with no 
transport of the animal between scans, allowing for less rigorous 
registration and image post-processing routines, and acquiring 
both PET and MRI scans simultaneously saves considerable 
amounts of time. However, if equipment is not available for simul-
taneous imaging, sequential PET/MRI is also a viable alternative. 
Movement of the subject should be minimized between the PET 
and the MRI to conserve anatomical orientation, which is very 
helpful when it comes to image registration between modalities in 
post-processing. Some PET/MRI scanners have the PET ring 
mounted on the front of the MR scanner, so it is outside of the 
magnetic ﬁeld and not considered “simultaneous” MRI since scans 
are done separately, but still in the same holder and animal trans-
port system. This usually restricts movement for registration to a 
single plane, improving overall reproducibility and registration 
accuracy.

Materials 
1. Integrated PET/MRI system, or PET insert purpose-built for 
insertion into an MRI. 
2. Physiological monitoring system. For optimizing PET acquisi-
tion, we recommend a minimum of both temperature and 
respiration monitoring, as previous work has shown variability 
of these parameters can signiﬁcantly affect metabolism and 
therefore PET quantitation [19–21]. Additionally, maintaining 
an optimal range for body temperature and respiration rate 
(surrogate measures of subject’s plane of anesthesia) will pro-
mote consistent physiology and limit the prospect of motion 
artifact for both PET and MRI acquisitions. 
3. MRI-compatible 
animal 
holder/bed. 
For 
sequential 
PET/MRI, this must be able to contain the animal in both 
scanners without requiring the animal to be repositioned. 
Some of the more advanced animal holders being developed 
involve fully sealing the animal within a holder that can be more 
easily moved between scanners [22]. Animals can then be 
prepared in a separate room from the scanners, which can be 
useful for high-volume imaging facilities, and for minimizing 
exposure to pathogens in certain research applications. These 
holders often allow a more controlled environment for the 
animal, which can improve reproducibility of positioning, and 
also help to maintain optimal physiology and limit motion 
artifact during scanning. 
4. Registration sample. This is particularly helpful for sequential 
PET/MRI to facilitate fusion of the PET and MRI acquisi-
tions. We recommend using a small capillary tube or spherical 
phantom ﬁlled with both the radioisotope of interest and an 
MR-visible substance. Manganese or gadolinium-doped water 
[23] is preferable for ensuring relaxation times similar to tissue. 
The radioisotope activity level in the capillary tube should be 
less than ½ or 1/3 of the likely activity in the ﬁeld of view, 
which may require some prior testing. Too much activity in the 
ﬁeld of view in non-essential regions can interfere with data 
visualization post-processing, requiring more extensive modiﬁ-
cation or trimming of images. To maximize logistics, we rec-
ommend tubes that can be easily swapped out for each scan, or 
a tube that will last for several scans. The exact size and position 
of the registration phantom will be governed by the avoidance 
of anatomy of interest in a particular application. Prepare a 
160 × 10-6 M concentration of MNCl2 as a stock solution. 
In a small vial, pipette a volume of MNCl2 that you expect to

Combined PET/MRI
395
occupy the volume of capillary tubes or other phantom used. 
As one example, a general purpose capillary tube (e.g., (1.15/ 
1.5)mm (ID/OD), 75 mm length) can be scored (using a small 
ﬁle) to desired lengths (e.g., 30 mm and 15 mm) and arranged 
as two intersecting tubes along the axial and trans-axial extent 
of the animal bed. Radioisotope activity (following the <1/3 
rule above) can then be mixed within the small MNCl2 vial. 
Place capillary tubes in this MNCl2/radioisotope mixture to 
take up the liquid mixture, seal both ends with clay, and assay/ 
record the activity level using a dosimeter. Tape the capillary to 
the animal bed prior to imaging in the intersecting conﬁgura-
tion indicated above. 
Some vendors offer integrated registration markers and 
auto-registration routines between modalities and other scan-
ner conﬁgurations with precise bed positioning that may per-
mit use of an established set of coordinate transformations via a 
separate registration calibration that can be applied to fuse PET 
and MRI acquisitions. In this instance, a rotationally asymmet-
ric set of three capillary tubes can be arranged along each 
imaging plane ﬁlled with a mixture of radioisotope and doped 
water for combined PET/MRI visibility. 
5. Radiotracers. The most commonly used and readily available 
radiotracer is [18 F]-2-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG); however, 
any PET tracer can be used. This includes but is not limited 
to a variety of 18 F, 11 C, and 89 Zr probes. These tracers are 
usually injected via the intravenous tail vein. 
6. MRI contrast agents. Depending on the sequences of interest 
(see Subheading 3.3 Sequences), it may be necessary to inject a 
contrast agent to provide additional information. This includes 
but is not limited to gadolinium (Gd) and superparamagnetic 
iron oxide (SPIO) agents. These agents can be added during or 
prior to scanning. 
7. Catheters. If injections of radiotracers must be done during 
scanning, or while the animal is positioned in such a way that 
limits access to the tail, a catheter can be used. These catheters 
are available commercially or can be fashioned in-lab using 
30-gauge ½ inch needles (for mice) or 24-gauge ½ inch nee-
dles (for rats) and micro tubing (0.025 inches outer diameter 
and 0.012 inches inner diameter). The tubing should be the 
minimal length necessary for access mid-scan. Unfortunately, 
for simultaneous PET/MRI, this can often be quite long, 
adding excess liquid volume in tubing that must be pushed 
into the animal. This tends not to be a problem in rats, where it 
is possible to inject over 1 mL via tail vein, but in mice is a 
severe limitation where it is only possible to inject 200 μL.

PET (Pre-scan): 
Image Quality, 
Calibrations, and Data 
Corrections 
PET image ﬁdelity is inﬂuenced by various physical factors related 
to the PET scanner hardware, electronics, and more generally, by 
the nature of coincidence detection, which is susceptible to signal 
attenuation and undesirable scattered and random coincidences. 
Metrics used to characterize PET system performance are well 
established [24, 25] and include measures of (i) spatial resolution; 
(ii) sensitivity; (iii) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); (iv) uniformity and 
performance of applied attenuation and scatter corrections; 
(v) signal loss at high activities due to detector deadtime; (vi) a 
noise equivalent count rate (NECR), which reconciles system data 
corrections of random and scattered coincidences; and (vii) quanti-
tative accuracy of applied attenuation and scatter corrections. 
It should be noted that, prior to new technological develop-
ments, operating a PET insert within a magnetic ﬁeld would not be 
possible. The magnetic ﬁelds would interfere with signals from the 
traditional photomultiplier tubes, resulting in distorted images. 
Current MR-compatible PET inserts have been designed such 
that, if all calibrations are done properly, there is no difference in 
image quality inside or out of the magnetic ﬁeld, avoiding concerns 
about effects on image quality. However, these PET systems still 
require the same corrections as stand-alone PET scanners. For 
optimal PET scanner performance, a number of routine calibra-
tions and quality control measures are required to mitigate certain 
performance-degrading characteristics that can be observed in PET 
imaging. 
Normalization—Inherent variations in count rate efﬁciencies 
exist between the many thousands of detector elements within a 
PET scanner. Slight differences in scintillator thickness, light emis-
sion, electronics performance, or scintillator ring geometries can 
alter the detector response to emitted photons [26–28]. The result-
ing count rate variance between detector lines of response (LORs) 
at identical activities ultimately compromises the uniformity that 
can be achieved by the system. Normalization scans are thus per-
formed to determine detector response for all LORs of a scanner 
and generate a normalization ﬁle that can be applied to all acquired 
data 
prior 
to 
reconstruction 
in 
order 
to 
correct 
for 
this 
non-uniformity [26–28]. 
Generally speaking, this procedure involves irradiating the 
entire PET detector ﬁeld of view (FOV) with an activity source 
for a pre-deﬁned number of counts or scan duration (typically long 
duration scans over several hours to generate high count statistics). 
Sources could include a 68 Ge line source, or a cylindrical or annulus 
phantom ﬁlled with 18 F. Normalization scans should be carried out 
after any scanner hardware changes, at major servicing intervals, or 
any time that there is a decrease PET image quality or performance

that suggests system uniformity has been compromised. Each PET 
system vendor will outline protocols and provide recommendations 
as to the best normalization procedures to follow for their system. 
Combined PET/MRI
397
Quantitative Calibrations—The intrinsic output registered by 
a PET scanner is decay counts or count rate. When corrected for 
scatter, attenuation, and tracer decay, a reconstructed PET image 
voxel represents an intensity that is proportional to radioactivity 
concentration [26, 27]. For direct quantitation of PET data, quan-
titative calibrations are carried out to compute voxel values that 
reﬂect absolute radiotracer concentration (an activity per unit vol-
ume, such as MBq/mL). Quantitative calibrations amount to 
determining an accurate cross-calibration factor between the PET 
scanner and the speciﬁc dose calibrator(s) used to assay injected 
doses to the subject in the PET imaging workﬂow. This cross-
calibration can then be applied to reconstructed PET data for 
quantitation. Once carried out, quantiﬁed PET data are often 
expressed as an activity concentration (MBq/mL), a percent 
injected dose per unit volume (%ID/cc) often used for evaluating 
tracer kinetics [29], or the semi-quantitative standardized uptake 
values (SUVs) that reﬂect tracer concentration in a particular vol-
ume of interest normalized to the injected dose per body weight of 
a subject [30]. 
Quantitative calibration generally involves performing a PET 
scan of a uniform cylinder of known radiotracer activity and volume 
and measuring the total counts generated in a representative region 
of interest on the PET image. From this, a simple calibration factor 
is generated to convert the voxel intensity of an image to a cali-
brated activity per unit volume [26–28]. The quantitative accuracy 
achieved with PET imaging relies heavily on careful execution of 
these quantitative calibrations; failure to do so can adversely affect 
the quantitative precision achieved by the system. Quantitative 
calibrations should be carried out daily or weekly (at minimum) 
during studies, in order to capture scanner performance on a given 
imaging day. If using a PET/MRI system that has a PET insert, 
quantitative calibrations must be done with the insert inside of the 
MRI system. Ideally, the uniform cylinder used for quantitative 
calibrations should also be placed on the animal holder to optimize 
reproducibility. 
From the PET equipment perspective, quantitative calibrations 
should be carried out for each dose calibrator used in the PET 
workﬂow (if more than one exists) and should be updated upon 
dose calibrator calibration (which should be carried out regularly, 
per the manufacturer’s recommendations). Quantitative calibra-
tions should also be generated for each isotope used for imaging 
(i.e., 18 F and 11 C), and for protocol-speciﬁc applications at the 
anticipated activity level, scan duration, and reconstruction proto-
col used for PET imaging. However, the addition of a large mag-
netic ﬁeld and varying other pieces of equipment, including

radiofrequency coils, complicates these calibrations. Quantitative 
calibrations should be done for each RF coil if the RF coil sits 
between the PET detector and the animal. This is important not 
only for RF coils used for different animals but also for RF coils that 
are designed for specialized body parts (i.e., brain vs. abdomen). 
398
Drew R. DeBay and Kimberly D. Brewer
It is also important to perform quantitative calibrations at 
routine intervals to ensure the reproducibility of the calibration 
over time. If the system calibrations are updated, new quantitative 
calibrations should also be generated. If there is evidence that the 
magnetic ﬁeld may have drifted signiﬁcantly, the calibrations should 
be repeated. Some of the newest MR systems are cryogen free and 
can be brought up to ﬁeld quickly using electrical power. If there 
has been a planned (or unplanned) quench of the ﬁeld on one of 
these systems, the quantitative calibration scan should be repeated. 
The quantitative calibration cylinders used should remain consis-
tent. The same type of vessel (i.e., plastic syringe vs. glass vial) 
should always be used during the dose draw assay of the calibration. 
If not consistently applied, dose measurement can be differentially 
attenuated and can cause a signiﬁcant drop in measurement accu-
racy. It is also important to ensure the clocks of the PET scanner 
workstation and dose calibrator are synched to the same date and 
time to accurately account for isotope decay between dose calibra-
tor and PET measurements. 
3.2 
MR (Pre-Scan): 
Image Quality, 
Calibrations, and Data 
Corrections 
Compared to PET, MRI does not require the same precise calibra-
tions and corrections prior to scanning. Many MR sequences have 
their own calibrations built in and are optimized for their own 
contrast and purposes (e.g., calibration of RF transmit power or 
receiver gain) that are not affected by the presence of PET scanning. 
The primary concerns for MR imaging quality when adding a PET 
insert are due to (1) distortion of the main magnetic ﬁeld, and 
(2) electronic noise. 
Adding anything into a large magnetic ﬁeld, including the 
animal or sample being imaged, will cause distortion to the ﬁeld 
itself. Active magnetic ﬁeld shimming, which uses small electric 
currents to generate magnetic ﬁelds in a variety of orientations, 
has been in use for decades to compensate for these distortions and 
improve ﬁeld homogeneity. However, there are limits to active 
shimming, and using magnetic materials in PET inserts would 
result in grossly distorted ﬁelds. Most of the materials in the PET 
insert are therefore specially designed to avoid this distortion, and 
the insert is also generally encapsulated in a RF shield [31]. Shim-
ming is often automated to maximize signal in the area of interest 
and state-of-the-art PET inserts should not cause any major distor-
tions. However, ﬁeld mapping can be done for testing purposes if 
artifacts appear which could be linked to ﬁeld distortion or signal 
drop out. This could indicate hardware issues within the insert or a 
failure in the shield.

Combined PET/MRI
399
Electronic noise in MR images due to a PET insert is also a 
concern. If not properly shielded, the electronics within the PET 
insert will generate radiofrequency signals that will be detected by 
the RF coil. Depending on the type of noise, this could manifest in 
a variety of ways in MR images. A single frequency unexpectedly 
picked up by the RF coil could manifest as spike or zipper artifacts 
[32] depending on the pulse sequence. This should not be a 
problem that occurs in fully functioning systems, but if MR artifacts 
linked only to PET scanning begin to occur, the structure of the RF 
shielding in the insert and cables should be examined. 
3.3 
Scanning
For the purposes of the following steps, we will describe the 
recommended procedures for scanning mice, as these are the 
most commonly used preclinical model. The procedures should 
be virtually identical for other models such as rats and hamsters, 
with the exception of a more restricted ﬁeld of view compared to 
the total animal size. However, if there may be deviations necessary 
due to size, we will note this. 
Workﬂow Scheduling—For simultaneous PET/MRI, it is 
recommended to begin MR scanning ﬁrst, since it requires more 
time and can take place during PET tracer uptake. Simultaneous 
PET/MRI can also be used for dynamic scans to simultaneously 
measure things such as perfusion (MRI) and initial radiotracer 
uptake (PET). For sequential PET/MRI, the choice of which 
modality to use ﬁrst will depend on certain considerations, includ-
ing (1) whether the facility is trying to minimize radioactivity 
within the MRI scanner, (2) the timing and availability of the 
radiotracer for injection, and (3) decay rate of the radiotracer 
(11 C tracers have a very quick decay rate and very tight timeline). 
Figure 2 includes potential workﬂows for both simultaneous 
and sequential PET/MRI for static and dynamic imaging (based on 
Fig. from Ref. [3]). Static imaging occurs after injection and uptake 
of a radiotracer (or contrast agent), with a single PET (or MR) 
image permitting quantiﬁcation and depicting the spatial distribu-
tion of the tracer (or contrast agent) at a given time. Dynamic 
imaging involves continuous scanning during radiotracer/contrast 
agent administration and uptake, providing an evaluation of tracer/ 
contrast agent concentration as a function of time and, ultimately, 
insight into the pharmacokinetics of the tracer/contrast agent. 
Registration Phantom—Prior to preparing the mouse, it is 
recommended that a small capillary tube or other phantom be 
prepared that can be used for registration. The sample should be 
placed in the animal holder within the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of both 
PET and MRI but should be sufﬁciently distanced from the area of 
interest of the scan, to minimize signal “spill-in” to voxels of 
interest (see Subheading 2, item 4 above for detailed phantom 
information).

Fig. 2 PET/MRI workﬂows for sequential (left) and simultaneous (right) PET/MRI, including static and dynamic 
imaging protocol implementations (based on Figure from Ref. [3], made in BioRender.com). For sequential 
imaging, workﬂows assume MRI ﬁrst for optimal time savings, but it is equally possible to execute PET 
scanning ﬁrst with added tracer uptake prior to imaging for static PET studies 
Radiotracer Injection—For many PET/MRI scans, mice will 
receive radiotracer injection prior to being placed in the animal bed, 
with uptake corresponding to preparation time and time used for 
MRI scans. High-resolution and specialized MRI scans are often 
lengthier than PET scans. In these cases, we recommend injecting 
mice outside of the scan room and then inserting them in the 
holder. In situations where radiotracer injection must be done 
when mice are within the PET scanner, the animal must be cathe-
terized prior to imaging. It should be noted that it is very difﬁcult 
to take a bolus injection machine near a traditional MRI scanner 
due to the ﬁeld extending beyond the magnet casing. This may 
restrict the types of injection being done. Newer magnets, particu-
larly cryogen-free models, often have much smaller stray ﬁelds, 
allowing the use of specialized machinery closer to the magnet. 
Anesthesia—Mice can be anesthetized prior to or post-
injection, depending on researcher comfort. Tail vein injections 
are often more difﬁcult in anesthetized mice. Due to stability and 
ease of modiﬁcation, we recommend using an inhalable anesthetic 
like isoﬂuorane or sevoﬂuorane for all imaging studies unless there 
is a crucial scientiﬁc reason or disease basis [21]. Combined with a 
carrier gas such as oxygen or room air, these inhalable anesthetics 
result in much stable respiration on behalf of the animals and are 
safer for longer and/or repeated imaging studies. Depending on 
the region of interest being studied, additional immobilization may

be added to reduce the likelihood of motion or shifting of the 
animals. For optimal immobilization, the head, torso, and feet 
should all be immobilized in some fashion. Immobilization can be 
done by taping regions of the animal to the bed. For the torso, this 
would involve using a large piece of tape that attaches to each side 
of the bed and goes over the animal, pushing it down snugly, but 
not so much that it restricts natural breathing. If the animal is 
snugly placed on the bed, it will also result in better physiological 
monitoring. 
Combined PET/MRI
401
Physiological Monitoring—Once the animal is anesthetized, 
physiological monitoring cables can be afﬁxed. While electrocar-
diogram (ECG) monitoring can be very useful, we recommend it 
only if absolutely necessary for advanced MRI analysis (e.g., corre-
lating imaging with cardiac cycles to correct for motion artifacts) 
since it can also cause image artifacts. Due to the length of most 
PET/MR imaging studies, respiration monitoring should be used 
for animal safety and to assess anesthesia depth. The anesthesia 
regime, including depth, can impact metabolic processes [21] and 
therefore affect radiotracer uptake. A respiratory bellow/pillow, 
placed beneath the abdomen of animals in prone position, is the 
most common choice. 
Temperature monitoring is often not strictly required for ani-
mal welfare purposes (depending on the length of scans, warming 
setup, and operator conﬁdence in system stability), but it can be 
crucial for reproducibility in advanced quantitation [19]. As with 
anesthetic depth, variations in body temperature can drastically 
affect metabolic rates, often in unpredictable ways with new radio-
tracers. Mice are particularly vulnerable to rapidly changing tem-
peratures due to unstable thermoregulation under anesthetic and 
will die if they get too cold. For scans longer than 15 min, a 
warming system should absolutely be used. When using forced air 
warming systems to keep mice at 37 °C, we also recommend that 
the ears and tail are covered with gauze or plastic to prevent drying, 
especially if a tail catheter is being used and/or longitudinal imag-
ing is being done. Mice tails and ears are extremely fragile and can 
dry out and burn very easily. 
MRI Sequences—The choice of MRI sequences depends upon 
the precise scientiﬁc question being asked in the experiment and 
whether the MRI is being used for (a) anatomical images only, 
(b) generation of an attenuation map, (c) study of a particular 
physiological parameter (diffusion, perfusion, functional MRI, 
chemical exchange, etc.), or a combination of all three. A full 
study of MR sequences is beyond the scope of this work (see Ref. 
[33] for more comprehensive information), and we will focus on 
some of the most common sequence types. 
Those unfamiliar with MRI should be aware that there is always 
a fundamental trade-off related to the use of the collected MR 
signal. There is a ﬁxed maximum amount of signal available,

which can only be increased with modiﬁed hardware such as a 
higher magnetic ﬁeld or the use of hyperpolarization. The three 
parameters in conﬂict over the use of this signal are the spatial 
resolution, scan time, and SNR of the image. Faster, higher-
resolution scans will be starved for signal and will appear grainy, 
making them less useful for combination with PET. As such, MRI 
scans with sufﬁcient signal and SNR for small animals such as mice 
are usually much longer than PET and, as mentioned previously 
(Fig. 2), workﬂow scheduling should take this into account. For 
simultaneous acquisitions, this is not a problem and combining the 
PET with the MRI often saves considerable time overall. But for 
sequential scanning, the scan time must be considered in concert 
with the necessary uptake time of the radiotracer prior to PET, 
along with its radioactive decay.

MR sequences for high-resolution depiction of soft tissue anat-
omy are commonly used in PET/MRI studies. Most basic studies 
will obtain either a T1-weighted sequence, such as a gradient 
recalled echo (GRE) [34], or a T2-weighted sequence, such as a 
rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) [34], or 
both. T1-weighted sequences can be chosen to maximize spatial 
resolution and tissue contrast, particularly gray-white contrast in 
the brain. T2-weighted sequences are generally used to evaluate 
potential pathology in tissues, such as brain tumors. Exact para-
meters will depend on the ﬁeld strength of the magnet and the 
presence of such equipment as multi-channel RF coils, with higher 
resolution and shorter scans possible at higher ﬁelds such as 7.0 T 
and with newer equipment. However, even at low ﬁeld strengths of 
1.0–1.5 T, it is possible to get resolution on the order of 300 μm, 
although these scans may take longer to yield sufﬁcient SNR. 
Another popular choice for high SNR at lower ﬁeld strengths is 
a sequence called balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) 
[35]. This sequence has a mix of T1 and T2 contrast and may not 
be suitable for distinguishing certain tissue types, but due to its 
high SNR efﬁciency, it can yield three-dimensional, high-resolution 
images (i.e., 150 μm or less) more quickly at lower ﬁeld strengths, 
such as 3.0 T, making it a strong choice for an anatomical underlay. 
MR sequences appropriate for use with attenuation correction 
algorithms (see post-scan corrections for more details on attenua-
tion correction) tend to either be atlas-based or primarily proton 
density-weighted [36]. Generally, a short echo time (TE) and long 
repetition time (TR) in a gradient echo sequence will yield proton 
density contrast by minimizing T1 and T2 contributions. Further 
modiﬁcations include the use of Dixon’s method for fat/water 
separation, which can be used to assign attenuation correction 
values based on the MR segmentation of water and fatty tissues 
[37], as well as the use of ultra-short TE (UTE) MRI sequences for 
more accurate delineation of bone, air and soft tissue [38].

Combined PET/MRI
403
Aside from these PET considerations, a discussion of the large 
variety of potential MR pulse sequences for studying physiological 
parameters is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, 
PET/MRI users are strongly encouraged to consider the use of 
MRI beyond simply an anatomical underlay. MRI alone has the 
potential for multiparametric imaging of several physiological para-
meters, which are not accessible by other imaging modalities (such 
as diffusion and chemical shift) [33]. These additional scans can 
often be added to an imaging protocol with minimal impact on the 
duration of a scanning session and can help maximize informational 
yield. 
3.4 
Post-Scan
1. PET Attenuation Correction—The attenuation of 511KeV 
photons within tissues of a scan subject is a signiﬁcant physical 
factor that can affect PET image ﬁdelity and quantiﬁcation 
accuracy. Attenuation correction methods can be applied to 
address this by generating separate attenuation coefﬁcient 
maps, effectively a classiﬁcation that reﬂects differences in elec-
tron density of tissues in the scanner ﬁeld of view [26, 28, 
39]. Registration of the attenuation correction map and target 
PET data set permits mathematical correction of these attenu-
ation effects. 
Historically, PET-only scanner conﬁgurations performed atten-
uation corrections based on transmission reference scans using an 
external rotating 68 Ge rod source during and after a subject’s PET 
scan. The advent of hybrid PET/CT scanners enabled the use of 
low-dose CT scans to generate attenuation maps that can be equiv-
alently scaled to reﬂect 511KeV attenuation observed in PET 
[39]. For PET/MR, specialized MR-based attenuation correction 
approaches have gained utility in recent years. The convenience of 
simultaneous PET/MR imaging favors MR-based attenuation cor-
rection methods; however, the registration and application of sepa-
rate CT-based attenuation maps is certainly possible if CT is also a 
part of the PET imaging workﬂow. Many of the current PET, PET/ 
CT, or PET/MR systems offer built-in attenuation correction 
methods that are available within the vendor’s acquisition and 
reconstruction software. 
There has been much discussion about whether attenuation 
correction is necessary for PET/MRI of small animals, particularly 
mice, due to the small volume and limited attenuation through 
tissue. For qualitative metrics, it is likely unnecessary, but previous 
work has demonstrated that, without attenuation correction, quan-
titative results are underestimated by up to 20% in mice and up to 
40% in rats [40, 41]. It is therefore highly recommended to use at 
least a simpliﬁed attenuation correction with PET/MRI, regardless 
of the source of the attenuation correction (e.g., derived from MRI, 
CT, or the PET itself).

2. Scatter, Random Coincidence, and Deadtime Correction—A 
PET system with good energy resolution and narrow photo-
peak energy window and coincidence timing resolution can 
diminish the effects of scatter and random coincidences 
[28]. The majority of scanners available today implement a 
variety of algorithms to calculate and subtract residual scatter 
and random coincidences, and correction for detector dead-
time with signal pileup at high activities providing an estimate 
of true coincidence events (see Ref. [26] for a more thorough 
treatment 
of 
these 
techniques). 
These 
built-in 
routines 
provided by the vendor can be applied in post-processing pipe-
lines or are integrated into certain reconstruction strategies and 
are not signiﬁcantly affected by the addition of MRI. 
3. PET Reconstruction—Once PET data are acquired, mathemat-
ical algorithms are employed to generate images representing 
the spatial distribution of radiotracer emissions from the sub-
ject within the scanner. There are two main types of image 
reconstruction in PET, namely, analytical and iterative recon-
struction techniques, which can be applied in 2D or 3D imple-
mentations [26, 28, 42]. 
Conventional reconstruction approaches use analytical techni-
ques to reconstruct tomographic PET data. In nuclear medicine, 
the most ubiquitous is the ﬁltered back projection (FBP) method. 
The advantages of FBP techniques include relatively fast processing 
speed that can often achieve high quantitative accuracy [26, 42, 
43]. In instances of low count statistics applications, FBP can suffer 
from streak or star-like artifacts and blurring from the ﬁltering step, 
resulting in decreased overall image resolution [26, 28, 43]. FBP, 
on its own, neglects to compensate for some important physical 
corrections such as random and scatter PET corrections, which 
would need to be applied independently. 
With the advent of faster computer processing speeds in recent 
years, iterative reconstruction approaches have emerged as viable 
alternatives to analytical methods, offering improvements in spatial 
resolution and reduction of image noise [28]. In general, these 
methods start with an initial prediction of some simpliﬁed radio-
tracer distribution, whose constituent projections are then derived 
by the process of forward projection [26, 39] over successive 
iterations. 
Common iterative algorithms include Maximum Likelihood 
Expectation Maximization (MLEM) and Ordered Subset Expecta-
tion Maximization (OSEM). Advantages of MLEM include the 
maintenance of spatial resolution with minimal noise ampliﬁcation 
in reconstructed images, with the disadvantage of longer processing 
times due to the often large number of iterations necessary to 
converge on suitable reconstructed images [27, 42]. OSEM is an 
adaptation of MLEM that introduces grouped subsets of uniformly

distributed projection data into the algorithm, which are applied to 
an updated target function at each iteration. The result is acceler-
ated processing time with fewer iterations required to converge on 
an appropriate solution [27, 42]. 
Combined PET/MRI
405
Iterative reconstruction methods offer higher contrast images 
with improved spatial resolution and reduction of noise compared 
to analytical methods. Additionally, corrections for scatter and 
attenuation can be integrated directly into these iterative algorithm 
computations, which is often advantageous. However, iterative 
methods are computationally expensive and may not be practical 
in some instances where processing time is prohibitive. 
In practice, when selecting the appropriate reconstruction 
technique to apply in a given research application, one should 
carefully consider the role of imaging in the study design and 
what information the imaging results intend to provide. The quan-
titative accuracy of reconstruction methods should be factored into 
decision-making and, if applicable, the number of iterations and 
subsets should be evaluated in representative sample datasets when 
developing imaging and analysis protocols for speciﬁc studies. If 
using high-resolution MRI scans as the anatomical underlay, PET 
images of higher resolution will be more useful in localizing activity 
to certain regions. This is also true if trying to correlate PET activity 
with an MRI physiological parameter. Trade-offs between proces-
sing time, quantitative accuracy, contrast, and achievable resolution 
will need to be weighed when selecting between analytical and 
iterative PET reconstruction techniques. 
4. PET/MR Registration—MR images are usually reconstructed 
immediately following acquisition as part of automated soft-
ware procedures. For more specialized and higher-resolution 
scans, reconstruction may be done ofﬂine using internal lab 
algorithms. Regardless, there is no additional consideration 
necessary for reconstruction of MR images due to the presence 
of PET. There are, however, steps necessary before PET and 
MR images can be merged or overlaid. 
Prior to registration, it may be necessary to convert either the 
PET or MR images to a common image ﬁle format such as NIFTI 
[44] or DICOM [44]. Some imaging scanners output data in 
proprietary image formats, but most will include software for con-
version to more common formats. It is also crucial at this stage to 
ensure that headers for both images have sufﬁcient information, 
particularly for quantitative calculations (PET and potentially MRI) 
and resolution (crucial when images must be resampled for over-
lay). Once both images are in the same format, the PET can be 
registered to the MRI. 
There are a variety of programs available for image registration, 
including free software such as imageJ (NIH, USA), FSL (Oxford,

UK), and Automated Image Registration (AIR) [45], and more 
advanced paid software programs such as Vivoquant and PMOD. 
Some labs prefer to build their own registration/visualization rou-
tines in, for example, Matlab or Python (http://www.python.org). 
There is publicly available code for reading NIFTI and/or DICOM 
ﬁles into both of these environments. Most programs may resample 
either the PET or the MR image when overlaying images; for 
visualization purposes, resampling the PET image and overlaying 
it on the MRI will result in better deﬁned activation localization. 
While it is unlikely that this resampling will signiﬁcantly affect the 
quantiﬁcation of PET results, researchers may prefer to measure 
injected dose/cc or MBq/mL from the original unchanged data.

Drew R. DeBay and Kimberly D. Brewer
Simultaneous PET/MRI has signiﬁcant advantages in requir-
ing minimal registration changes when combining images. There 
may be a standard translation required due to an offset of the PET 
center compared to the MRI, but more advanced deformations and 
rotations should not be necessary. However, researchers should be 
aware that some imaging systems save images in radiological versus 
anatomical orientation where left and right are reversed. This can 
be easily identiﬁed in some types of imaging but may be missed in 
others. Even in simultaneous PET/MRI, the addition of the previ-
ously mentioned registration phantom can be very helpful for 
avoiding simple registration pitfalls by identifying necessary auto-
matic translations. If automated registration routines are used, 
images should be manually checked at least visually before further 
analysis is done. 
Sequential PET/MRI, particularly when the setup necessitates 
signiﬁcant movement between the PET and the MRI, may require 
more advanced registration. This can be particularly problematic in 
body transforms where motion is more pronounced over even short 
time scales. In a multi-modality study of inter- and intra-scan 
movement of the immobilized hind legs of rats, tumors on the 
immobilized legs moved between 0.2 and 0.3 mm within the 2 h 
scan and 0.2 mm between scans [46]. While 0.5 mm may not seem 
like a large distance, in high-resolution MRI, this can be a shift of 
several voxels. Regions such as lungs and the abdomen will likely 
undergo even more movement, emphasizing the need for ﬂexible 
and accurate registration. 
Most imaging programs will have advanced registration rou-
tines, both manual and automated. These should be closely and 
carefully adjusted for each animal to minimize errors. Automated 
routines tend to work best on regions such as the brain but may fail 
in more deformable body regions.

Summary 
Statement 
Exploiting the inherent strengths of both PET and MRI modalities, 
combined PET/MRI enables the acquisition of more comprehen-
sive information about biological systems. As detailed in this chap-
ter and throughout this book, PET can be used to interrogate

cellular function with incomparable sensitivity. MRI offers not only 
high-resolution anatomical information but can also provide com-
plementary multiparametric information on a variety of physiologi-
cal processes. Technological advances that enable simultaneous 
PET/MRI further improve workﬂow efﬁciencies, data quality, 
and, ultimately, provide an enhanced picture of the underlying 
biological processes of interest than either modality in isolation.

Quantitation of Oncologic Image Features for Radiomic 
Analyses in PET 
Travis L. Williams, Mithat Gonen, Rick Wray, Richard K. G. Do, 
and Amber L. Simpson 
Abstract 
Radiomics is an emerging and exciting ﬁeld of study involving the extraction of many quantitative features 
from radiographic images. Positron emission tomography (PET) images are used in cancer diagnosis and 
staging. Utilizing radiomics on PET images can better quantify the spatial relationships between image 
voxels and generate more consistent and accurate results for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, etc. This 
chapter gives the general steps a researcher would take to extract PET radiomic features from medical 
images and properly develop models to implement. 
Key words Radiomics, PET, Imaging features, Machine learning, Oncology, Analysis

Introduction 
Radiomics is a fast-growing and continuously evolving ﬁeld of 
study involving the extraction of numerous quantitative features 
from radiographic images [1]. Software algorithms mine these 
features by analyzing multiple aspects of the images (i.e., physical, 
textural, histogram, ﬁlter-based, and fractal) [1]. The hope sur-
rounding radiomics stems from the long-held view that medical 
images contain much more information than what is discernible to 
trained radiologists [2]. Driven by the potential to capture tumor 
heterogeneity, radiomic signatures derived from subregions of a 
tumor with differing biological characteristics may identify unex-
plored phenotypes [3]. Radiomics have been used to characterize 
tumor phenotypes for predicting prognosis and therapeutic 
response for various diseases with a variety of imaging modalities 
[4, 5].

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a vital tool in the 
armamentarium of techniques used by clinicians for cancer diagno-
sis and management [6]. Attempts to quantify PET are well docu-
mented: Treatment response and patient survival are predicted by 
standardized uptake value (SUV) of [18 F]-4-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG) in several studies [7–11], but these results can conﬂict 
[12]. SUV is dependent on multiple factors (patient weight, 
blood sugar level, FDG injection timing, dose correction, scanner, 
and image reconstruction algorithm); therefore, SUV alone does 
not provide consistent and accurate quantitative information 
[13]. As a consequence, investigators have sought more robust 
quantitative image assessment that aids clinical diagnosis and treat-
ment evaluation [14]. Radiomics has been explored to address gaps 
in existing PET metrics by offering complementary metrics on 
variation in pixel intensity values and spatial relationships between 
image voxels [2, 15]. 
Radiomic features can be derived from the PET scan or the 
associated diagnostic image (CT or MRI) or jointly and used to 
create predictive and prognostic models. Radiomic features most 
often capture variability in pixel intensity values, so features 
extracted from an anatomic image (CT/MRI) are complementary 
to those extracted from a molecular image (PET). Figure 1 illus-
trates the normal PET and CT scans juxtaposed with their granular 
representations of the pixel variation of each for comparison. 
This chapter details the basic building blocks of designing a 
radiomic model from a PET/CT scan so that a researcher new to 
the ﬁeld of radiomics could exploit this exciting technology. While 
radiomics of PET/MRI have been reported, PET/MRI has not 
reached widespread adoption clinically so the chapter focuses atten-
tion on PET/CT methods [16]. The chapter also addresses the 
current challenges regarding standardization toward the generation 
of more robust imaging biomarkers.

2.1 
Patient Cohorts
In any imaging study, standard protocols concerning patients and 
protected health information (PHI) must be strictly adhered to and 
followed. The anonymization of PHI, having accountability to an 
institutional review board, and including waivers of informed con-
sent are major examples of protocols to ensure research integrity 
and ﬁdelity. Clinical factors, set by the research institution, are 
acquired by reviewing patients’ medical records. The criteria for 
patient inclusion and exclusion should be outlined to explain how 
the ﬁnal cohort is formed. Patients should be reviewed for a set 
duration determined by the research institution, with a second or 
third cohort from another window of time as a validation set. 
2.2 
Image 
Acquisition 
Each patient in the protocol has undergone routine imaging 
whereby PET scans are obtained. The patients are injected with a 
radiotracer (the most common is ﬂuorodeoxyglucose) and rested 
for the course of the pharmacokinetics uptake period. The output 
of these scans is a voxel model, a 3D matrix of raw data expressed as 
intensity values. Many parameters contribute to the acquisition 
process, such as voxel size, the speciﬁc reconstruction algorithm, 
and other values of interest for the PET imaging protocols for a 
particular institution. There is a strong likelihood that the chosen 
variables will have a signiﬁcant impact on the computed radiomics 
features [17, 18]. Certain features are greatly affected, while others 
are moderately to minimally affected [19], so care should be taken 
to ensure that the collected images are similarly acquired and 
reconstructed. 
2.3 
Preprocessing
The goal of preprocessing the images is to increase the probability 
of achieving the best, most robust features by reducing noise, 
emphasizing important features at various scales, thresholding, 
and resampling the number of bits for the encoding to account 
for acquisition variability. Spatial ﬁltering methods such as Butter-
worth, Gaussian, and Laplacian ﬁltering are used to reduce noise or 
accentuate features [20]. Windowing is applied to create upper and 
lower bounds for thresholding the data and establishing a set of 
acceptable values. Typical resampling of the data (usually initially 
12–16 bits) compresses it to either four, six, or eight bits prior to 
feature extraction [20]. Some commercial and open-source soft-
ware packages for preprocessing mentioned in these studies 
include: PyRadiomics and MIM Maestro. 
2.4 
Segmentation
The segmentation of tumor regions of interest (ROI) varies 
between annotators and studies. Manual segmentation, semi-
automatic, and automatic segmentation methods are represented 
across these studies. The segmentation results are under the super-
vision of and approved by one or more expert radiologist.

Generally, the resulting segmentations are scaled and normalized, 
with dilation applied to capture the boundary area. Some commer-
cial and open-source segmentation software packages mentioned in 
these studies include: PMOD 3.3, MeVisLab© , and MIM Maestro.

Methods 
Radiomics is an advanced, computer-based algorithm that extracts 
radiological features from medical images to help identify, diag-
nose, and predict patient response for numerous diseases. Explicit 
derivation of radiomic features are done using so-called handcrafted 
features, while implicit derivation is achieved using deep learning 
approaches. The general top-level design of the radiomic workﬂow 
involves four principle components: image acquisition, tumor seg-
mentation, radiomic signature, and machine learning analysis. Each 
use case of the workﬂow is complex, and the application differs 
across institutions and research labs. Figure 2 gives an overview of 
the radiomic process from patient to predicted outcome. 
3.1 
Feature 
Extraction 
Feature extraction involves computing quantitative parameters on 
the ROI. There are two over-arching methods of calculating fea-
tures. The ﬁrst method involves explicit direction from the 
researchers, duly named “handcrafted features”. The second 
method uses deep learning to implicitly derive features from train-
ing on large datasets of images through the learning process of its 
network. Handcrafted features primarily are subdivided into three 
types of features based on shape, histogram, and texture. Figure 3 
gives a top-level view of features and the two ways they are 
extracted. 
3.1.1 
Shape Features
Shape features seek to describe the geometrical characteristics of the 
ROI. They are computed at the slice level (2D) or from the entire 
ROI (3D). The main objective is to distinguish between smooth, 
round, and normal lesions from spiculated, elongated, and abnor-
mal ones [17]. Common shape features are compactness, ﬂatness, 
elongation, rectangular ﬁt, spherical disproportion, sphericity, sur-
face area, volume, and surface-to-volume ratio [17].

of the images, segmentation of tumors, feature extraction, postprocessing, and analysis of the radiomics by 
building and evaluating prediction models. The desired outcome is determined by the design of the study

Fig. 3 Top-level view of the two different ways features are extracted from tumor segmentations. Deep 
learning implicitly derives features from the ROI while handcrafted features are explicitly derived by the 
researcher from the ROI 
3.1.2 
Histogram Features
Histogram features, also known as ﬁrst order statistical features, 
represent surface texture and intensity concentration throughout 
the image. These are examples of histogram-based parameters: 
mean, median, maximum, minimum values of the voxel intensities 
on the image, skewness (asymmetry), kurtosis (ﬂatness), unifor-
mity, and randomness (entropy) [17]. 
3.1.3 
Texture Features
The purpose of texture features is to quantify the variability of the 
grey-scale levels in the ROI. They provide a sense of the spatial 
assignment of the voxel intensities and therefore are able to assess 
intra-lesion heterogeneity, regarded as a concrete indication of poor 
prognosis and malignancy [21]. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matri-
ces (GLCM), Grey Level Run-Length Matrices (GLRLM), and 
Neighborhood Grey-Tone Difference Matrices (NGTDM) are 
examples 
of 
second 
order 
statistical 
texture 
features 
[22– 
24]. Higher order statistical texture features incorporate ﬁlters or 
mathematical transforms to identify various types of patterns, 
reduce noise, or reveal sharp details of an image. Wavelets, Gabor 
ﬁlters, Laplacian transforms, fractal analysis, and Local Binary Pat-
terns are examples of these types of features [25–28]. 
3.2 
Postprocessing
Once the features are computed by the aforementioned methods, 
further processing needs to occur to ensure an optimal output 
(Fig. 4). Depending on the needs of the dataset, this processing 
may reduce redundancy or increase discrimination capability [29].

features create the radiomic signature. The two circular shapes denote examples of feature selection vs 
feature generation algorithms, with the LDA being enclosed in both to show its dual usage. The output analysis 
from the prediction modeling is shown by giving examples of an ROC curve, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and 
the Cox Hazard ratio plots 
3.2.1 
Feature Selection
Several different methods of feature selection are used to reduce the 
number of features. First, duplicate values are removed from the 
feature list. Secondly, highly correlated features and groupings of 
highly correlated features are identiﬁed by a Pearson linear correla-
tion coefﬁcient (varies by study), and all but the single most signiﬁ-
cant 
feature 
are 
eliminated 
[30]. 
To 
further 
reduce 
the 
dimensionality, one or more of these techniques are used: least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), recursive fea-
tures elimination based on Naive Bayes (RFE-NB), selection by 
ﬁlter based on linear discriminant analysis (SBF-LDA), and recur-
sive features elimination based on random forest (RFE-RF) [31– 
33]. The ﬁnal pruning of features is done by using L1 regulariza-
tion, Cox modeling, and/or Mann-Whitney U test [34, 35]. 
3.2.2 
Feature Generation
Feature generation uses the features of one or more existing fea-
tures to create new features. The purpose of this data augmentation 
is to incorporate new information to be utilized in model construc-
tion, hopefully causing it to obtain greater robustness and accuracy. 
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analy-
sis (PCA), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), 
and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) are some algorithms used 
for feature generation [36].

3.3 
Prediction 
Modeling 
The prediction models constructed are guided by the research 
question (Fig. 4). Once a classiﬁcation or regression model is 
generated, a validation set of patients are evaluated, with the 
model making predictions. Examples of model outputs include 
prognosis, recurrence, survival, and therapeutic response. Studies 
analyzing recurrence or therapeutic response typically use super-
vised learning methods. Whereas studies analyzing prognosis or 
survival 
(disease-free 
survival 
(DFS), 
overall 
survival 
(OS), 
progression-free 
survival 
(PFS), 
and 
recurrence-free 
survival 
(RFS)) typically use unsupervised learning techniques. Common 
supervised learning algorithms used include LASSO-Cox, LDA, 
linear regression (LR), multivariate LR (Mult. LR), multivariable 
modeling (Mult. modeling), random forest (RF), and support 
vector machines (SVM). Unsupervised learning approaches include 
k-means clustering, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, nonnegative 
matrix 
factorization 
(NMF), 
and 
Cox 
proportion 
hazard 
regression. 
3.4 
Statistical 
Analysis 
To compare groups and assess clinicopathological associations, 
methods such as the t test, χ2 test, Fisher’s test, or Mann-Whitney 
U test are used. All statistical tests are two-sided. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance is shown with a p-value <0.05. Accuracy (Acc), area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), 
and speciﬁcity (Sp) are used to evaluate the model performance for 
supervised learning outcomes like therapeutic response (Fig. 4). 
Kaplan-Meier curves generate survival curves and are compared 
using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model is 
used for univariate and multivariate analysis to analyze survival 
with a hazard ratio (HR). 
3.5 
Deep Learning
Deep learning is a recent advancement in artiﬁcial intelligence that 
incorporates many “deep” layers of computation to extract high-
level features from raw input [37]. Survival, image segmentation, 
and classiﬁcation are some of the many areas of interests within 
medical applications that deep learning has been useful. Deep 
learning algorithms increasingly are implemented in medical imag-
ing and have great promise for research and as a complimentary 
tool in clinical radiology [38]. 
Unlike other machine learning algorithms that require hard-
coded and handcrafted features generated by the user, deep 
learning algorithms derive generalized features from learning on a 
training set. The model constructed through training is tested on 
an unseen test set and gives predictions of the probability of a 
certain class (see Note 11). Convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs), stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs), and deep recur-
rent neural networks (RNNs) are examples of different types of 
deep neural networks.

Example PET 
Radiomics Extraction 
and Selection 
In an effort to give practical advice, the following describes the 
steps for extracting radiomic features from a PET scan using open 
source software tools: 
1. A PET scan containing a mass in the left lung was obtained (see 
Note 4). 
2. 3D Slicer was used to manually segment the image [39] (see 
Notes 6 and 12). 
3. The image was normalized using the NormalizeImageFilter in 
the SimpleFilter module of 3D Slicer (see Note 5). 
4. The PyRadiomics extension (SlicerRadiomics) that interfaces 
with 3D Slicer was used to perform feature extraction [40] 
(ﬁrst order, GLDM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, Shape, 
and Shape 2D) (see Notes 1, 3, 7, and 9). 
5. The features were stored in a .csv ﬁle for further analysis (see 
Note 1). 
6. Remove duplicate values (see Notes 2 and 8). 
7. Identify and remove highly correlated features using rank cor-
relation with the corr function [30] (see Notes 3 and 10). 
8. Reduce features using random forest with the oobPermuted-
PredictorImportance function [32] (see Notes 3 and 8). 
9. Prune ﬁnal features using L1 regularization with the ﬁtcecoc 
function [35] (see Notes 3 and 10). 
3.7 
Caveats and 
Future Opportunities 
for PET Radiomics 
Over the past few decades, medical imaging has become an increas-
ingly important ﬁxture in diagnosing and managing cancer. The 
allure of radiomics is due to its ability to offer non-intrusive, 
quantitative, high-throughput image analysis and monitoring of 
tumors to aid in decision-making for clinicians [15]. PET imaging 
is used as a 3D substitute of tumor biology, with varying biological 
processes and features exposed depending on the radiotracer 
injected [15]. Radiomics are, therefore, an exciting method to use 
to extract biomarkers from the PET images. PET features have 
correlated with treatment outcomes for tumor entities in various 
studies [41–44]. 
Despite the promise and potential of PET radiomic applica-
tions, there remain many well-understood challenges and limita-
tions that need to be addressed to create robust markers for clinical 
use. In many PET radiomic studies, the radiomic features extracted 
vary greatly, with little consistency in the type and number of 
features extracted, as well as the methodology adopted to choose 
the ﬁnal feature set [14, 45]. Each institution uses different imag-
ing parameters and machines to capture the medical images 
[14, 45]. Imaging parameter and reconstruction differences make

it difﬁcult to replicate prior experiments. Regarding tumor regions 
of interest, radiologists must manually segment the images, which 
is time-consuming to complete. Auto segmentation and semi-
automatic segmentation algorithms have been proposed to alleviate 
this issue, but require supervision and reﬁnement by radiologists. 
Radiomic studies tend to be singular endeavors, due to the struggle 
in sharing imaging data, with no external validation of the devel-
oped models as a result [46]. Many patient cohorts are too small to 
conclusively declare that the models generated would perform 
similarly on larger datasets. Combining datasets from multiple 
institutions [47] would potentially be a solution to this problem. 
Unfortunately, the formation of these large datasets is often sty-
mied by medical, industrial, and international politics. 
PET Radiomics
417
To advance PET radiomic studies past preliminary results, 
standardization and an adherence to common practices has to 
occur [45]. Data scalability and multicenter data sharing would 
allow for deeper research and more robust results [47]. To quell 
concerns of unsecure data and breaches, one possible solution to 
safe and secure multicenter data sharing are federated learning 
techniques. Federated learning collaboratively trains algorithms 
without exchanging data, which addresses the problem of privacy 
and data governance [48]. Privatization algorithms are needed to 
encrypt and secure data from attackers and support federated 
learning as a trusted method of multicenter data sharing [49]. Fur-
thermore, designing accurate, easily adoptable auto segmentation 
algorithms would help radiologists quickly analyze more data. 
Implementing multimodal data approaches integrating quantita-
tive, clinical, histological, genomic, and radiomic data is essential 
in designing personalized treatments [46]. 
Proposals to standardize radiomic features and develop strong, 
adoptable practices for the medical machine learning community 
have been made based on research by a collaboration of research 
groups. The Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) is a 
joint effort between 25 research groups who validated consensus-
based reference values for 169 radiomics features [50]. Their study 
showed the potential for calibration and veriﬁcation of radiomics 
software. 
Additionally, to curtail the sparse details shown in many studies, 
transparency in the design and implementation of prediction mod-
els is proposed as a solution. The Transparent Reporting of a 
multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diag-
nosis (TRIPOD) Initiative was crafted during a series of meetings 
between health care professionals, methodologists, and journal 
editors. TRIPOD is a set of recommended guidelines for the 
reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a predic-
tion model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes [51].

Notes 
Here we describe potential sources of error in a standard radiomics 
pipeline and offer suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of 
these errors in the design of radiomic studies. 
1. In total, 107 features are extracted (if using wavelet-based 
features this number jumps to 851). The 3D Slicer approach 
is ideal as the software includes state-of-the-art implementa-
tions of segmentation tools. However, if there is a large batch 
of images, writing a script within 3D Slicer (or modifying the 
example script given on the PyRadiomics GitHub) would be 
the better approach. The example radiomic feature extraction 
script and core code for PyRadiomics can be found here: 
https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics. 
3D 
Slicer 
uses PyRadiomics, which enables a smooth transition from 
code to GUI. 
2. In this practical example done in MATLAB, the following steps 
detail feature selection and the methods used at each step. As 
stated previously, there are many different ways to implement 
these steps. The algorithms selected in this example are chosen 
due to familiarity and prior positive results on other datasets. 
3. In a larger dataset, these steps may be repeated empirically to 
ﬁnd the best features and reduce the number of features. An 
example MATLAB script that can be modiﬁed for this process 
i s  
h e r e :  
h t t p s : // g i t h u b . c o m / t l w i l l  i 3 /  
exampleFeatureSelection. 
4. Each medical center represented in these studies uses different 
scanning equipment, parameters, and reconstruction methods 
in the acquisition of their images. These differences make it 
difﬁcult to combine efforts across institutions as the images are 
created and normalized to different standards. 
5. Preprocessing is a crucial step in the workﬂow and may signiﬁ-
cantly affect the overall outcome, as numerous experiments 
have demonstrated [52]. 
6. Manual segmentation is currently the most utilized and reliable 
method of generating an ROI; however, it is very time-
consuming, and many institutions do not have the resources 
to have every tumor region segmented by hand. 
7. Although features originate from the aforementioned types, 
there is no standard across the ﬁeld that determines how 
many features should be extracted. Consequentially, there are 
studies that extract hundreds of features, while others extract 
thousands. The extraction of too many features creates a 
greater risk of overﬁtting and possibly takes more time to 
reduce the dimensionality of the features.

PET Radiomics
419
8. It is important to utilize the algorithms that are most under-
stood to the individual researcher to perform feature extrac-
tion, selection, and generation. Other algorithms can be 
familiarized in conjunction with the one(s) already implemen-
ted to increase the software toolbox and explore the nuances of 
other methods. 
9. Software packages in Python (PyRadiomics) and MATLAB are 
used by some institutions to generate features. Many develop 
in-house programs to extract features. This also makes it difﬁ-
cult to standardize the methodology of extracting features 
across the ﬁeld. 
10. Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS), and R soft-
ware are the primary software packages used for statistical 
analysis in many studies. Additionally, some studies used 
them for feature reduction. 
11. A drawback to extracting features from deep neural networks is 
that it is difﬁcult to understand the decision-making of the 
model. There are visualization algorithms such as Grad-CAM 
that attempt to show the activations that the network uses to 
make predictions [53]. At times, these activated sections are 
inconsistent with logical results (e.g., activated sites shown on 
zeroed values outside of the tumor region). 
12. The latest version of 3D Slicer should be installed for the best 
results.

Multiplexing Autoradiography 
David Y. Lewis 
Abstract 
Autoradiography, the direct imaging of radioactive distribution in tissue sections, is a powerful technique 
that has several key advantages for the validation of PET radiotracers. Using autoradiography, we can 
localize radiotracer uptake to neighbours of cells, and when multiplexed with additional radiotracers, 
ﬂuorescent probes, or in situ tissue analysis, autoradiography can help to characterize the mechanism of 
radiotracer uptake and assess functional heterogeneity in tissue. In this chapter, the author outlines the basic 
ex vivo autoradiography protocol and shows how it can be multiplexed using dual radionuclides 18 F and 
14 C. They also highlight where autoradiography can be combined with other technologies to provide 
synergistic information for interrogating spatial biology.

Introduction 
Autoradiography directly images radioactive distribution in tissue. 
The ex vivo method typically involves injecting a radioactive tracer 
into an animal, waiting for uptake, distribution, and sufﬁcient 
clearance before culling and harvesting relevant tissues. These tis-
sues are then frozen, cut in a cryostat into thin sections, and directly 
apposed to a photographic ﬁlm or a storage phosphor screen, 
which, after a period of exposure, can be processed and analyzed 
to produce images and data of radiotracer distribution. The tissues 
sections can be further processed by histological techniques. 
Key discoveries using autoradiography laid the foundation for 
the development of positron emission tomography (PET). In pio-
neering experiments, Louis Sokoloff developed a fully quantitative 
autoradiography technique by combining a glucose analogue, car-
bon-14 labelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose, with rapid arterial blood sam-
pling and ex vivo cryosectioning to map local cerebral glucose 
utilization [1]. These early studies demonstrated the potential of 
autoradiography to quantify spatial biology and provided a

forerunner to clinical imaging with [18 F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-glucose 
([18 F]FDG). There have been major advances in PET technology 
over the last 40 years, and PET has been widely disseminated. 
However, there is still an important role for autoradiography, and 
three critical advantages make it an essential tool for all PET 
scientists.
424
David Y. Lewis
First, due to positron range and noncollinearity, PET has a 
fundamental spatial resolution limit of around 1 mm. By close 
apposition of the imaging plate to tissue and direct measurement 
of the positron, rather than annihilation photons, autoradiography 
has a relatively high spatial resolution of around 50 μm for positron 
emitters. Due to reduced partial volume errors, autoradiography 
improves the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of radiotracer uptake 
in small structures and improves assessment of PET radiotracer 
heterogeneity in tissue. 
Second, with any PET radiotracer, there is ambiguity in localiz-
ing the signal to underlying anatomy and pathology. Radiotracer 
coregistration to macroscopic anatomy can be performed with dual 
modality scanners such as PET/CT or PET/MRI, but the precise 
structures or substructures may be unknown and the pathology 
cannot 
be 
determined 
using 
standard 
structural 
imaging. 
Performing autoradiography on tissue sections and correlating 
with 
histological 
staining 
(Fig. 
1a), 
immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), immunoﬂuorescence (IF; Fig. 1b, c), or in situ hybridiza-
tion (ISH) deﬁnes the relationship between radiotracer uptake and 
cell pathology, protein and RNA distribution. This parallel multi-
plexing informs on radiotracer properties and underlying biology. 
With increasing availability of new technologies for interrogating 
spatial biology, multiplexing with autoradiography provides a more 
comprehensive interpretation of radiotracer distribution than PET 
imaging alone. 
Third, simultaneous comparison of 11 C and 18 F tracers is not 
possible with PET as both radionuclides produce gamma emissions 
that are almost exclusively 511 keV. Multiple radiotracers can be 
directly compared with autoradiography if their radionuclides have 
sufﬁciently different properties, such as differences in radionuclide 
half-life or the energy of the emitted β particle. By substituting 14 C 
for 11 C  or  3 H for 18 F, different radionuclides can be spatially 
deconvolved. For example, 18 F  (β+ emitter) and 14 C  (β- emitter) 
can be separated due to the large differences in their half-life (18 F: 
109.7 min and 14 C: 5730 years) and β energy (18 F: 633 keV and 
14 C: 156 keV). 18 F, when injected at 100-fold higher activity, 
produces an autoradiogram within 3 h with minimal (<0.1%) 14 C 
contamination. When the 18 F is left to decay over 26 or more half-
lives (<48 h) and the slides are reexposed to a clean imaging plate 
for several weeks, a 14 C image with no 18 F contamination is pro-
duced (Fig. 2b). Similar approaches can be used to separate radio-
nuclides based on their β energy, for example, 3 H and 14 C have

sufﬁciently different penetration properties that can be separated 
using a thin ﬁlm to block the titrated β but allow passage of the 14 C 
β particle [4]. These approaches can map biological activity in tissue 
using complementary radiotracers. Two radiotracers provide an 
additional dimension to single radiotracer autoradiography, for

3. Aliquots (100 μL or 1 mL) can be stored at -20 °C for several 
months until ready for use. Working solutions can be stored at 
4 °C. Check degradation rates and quality control methods 
from manufacturer before using old stock. 
3.2 
Animal 
Preparation (Adapted 
from [6]) 
1. Switch on the small animal heating chamber 30 min prior to 
use and set it to 37–40 °C. 
2. Line the small animal heating chamber with absorbent paper. 
3. Switch on the small animal heating plate and set to 37 °C. 
4. Prepare anesthesia machine by ﬁlling the isoﬂurane vaporizer, 
switching on the medical air or oxygen delivery system, and 
lining the induction box with absorbent paper. 
5. Prepare injection cannulas (one cannula per mouse) using two 
30G needles and a 10–15 cm length of polyethylene tubing 
(0.28 mm Ø). Break one needle by holding with needle forceps 
and twisting repeatedly until the needle breaks at the plastic 
end. Place the blunt end of this broken needle into one end of 
the polyethylene tubing. Place the second 30G needle, needle 
end ﬁrst, into the other end of the polyethylene tubing. Finally, 
ensuring that no bubbles are present, ﬁll a 1 mL syringe with 
400 μL heparinized saline and place into the plastic port of the 
30G needle. Fill the cannula with heparinized saline by ﬂushing 
through with about 100 μL. 
6. Bring mice to the procedure room and place in heating cham-
ber for 10–30 min prior to cannulation in order to dilate the 
tail vein. 
7. Attach the induction chamber to the isoﬂurane vaporiser and 
switch on the gas supply. The isoﬂurane concentration should 
be set to 3% for induction of anesthesia. 
8. Once the induction chamber is ﬁlled with isoﬂurane, remove 
one mouse from the heating box and place into the chamber. 
9. When the mouse is fully anesthetised, change the ﬂow from the 
induction box to the anesthetic nose cone. Remove the mouse 
from the chamber and place on its side on the small heating 
plate, ensuring the nose is placed fully in the anesthetic nose 
cone. Change the isoﬂuorane concentration to 2% for 
cannulation. 
10. The heat lamp can also be used to ensure the mouse is warm 
and tail veins are fully dilated prior to inserting the cannula. 
Care must be taken not to place to heat lamp too close to the 
tail to prevent damage to the tail. 
11. Stroke the tail moving from a proximal to distal direction to 
further dilate the vein. Begin cannulation as distally as possible, 
allowing for more proximal attempts as necessary.

12. To insert the cannula, grasp the mouse tail using the thumb 
and index ﬁnger of the nondominant hand and bend the tail 
slightly so that the needle and the vein are parallel to each 
other. Then holding the needle of the cannula in the dominant 
hand with the bevel up, insert the needle into the lateral tail 
vein of the mouse and advance the needle a few millimetres. 
When the cannula is inserted into the vein, blood may ﬂash 
back into the cannula. Correct placement can be checked by 
ﬂushing a small amount of saline into the vein; there will be 
little resistance if the cannula is in the correct place. If there is 
resistance and the tail around the injection site blanches white, 
then the needle should be withdrawn and cannulation 
attempted again. 
13. Once the cannula is inserted, secure it to the tail using topical 
skin adhesive. 
14. The isoﬂurane can be reduced to 1% for maintenance. 
15. Similarly, the mouse body temperature should be maintained 
by changing the set temperature on the animal heating plate as 
necessary. 
3.3 
Preparation of 
[18 F] and [14 C] 
substrates for 
Injection 
1. Collect PET tracer directly from supplier or temporary storage 
location. As 18 F has a short half-life, there is a necessity to work 
quickly. 
2. Prepare radioactive doses inside a 5 cm thick lead isotope 
workstation for radioprotection, and check regularly for per-
sonal and laboratory contamination using a contamination 
monitor. 
3. Following 18 F collection, the exact concentration of activity in 
MBq/mL needs to be calculated. This can be achieved by 
placing 100 μL of the stock solution into the dose calibrator 
and measuring the total radioactivity. It is important to note 
the time of this measurement, so all calculations can be decay-
corrected. 
4. Estimate the time of radiotracer injection into the animal, and 
use the following equation to calculate the amount of activity at 
that time: 
A t  = A0 × e - λt 
1 
A(t)—radioactive dose at time t (MBq); A(0)—original radio-
active dose at time zero (MBq); t—elapsed time from initial 
radioactivity measurement (min); λ—decay constant: 
λ = ln 2
ð Þ  
t1=2 
ð2Þ 
t1/2—radioactive half-life (min); 109.7 min for 18 F.

Multiplexing Autoradiography
431
5. From the measured stock activity, calculate the amount of 
activity required to make a stock solution of 185 MBq/mL at 
the time of injection; 37 MBq is required per animal (see 
Note 4). 
6. Once the doses have been calculated for 37 MBq of injected 
activity, add the exact dose volume required into a 1 mL syringe 
and place a Luer tip syringe cap on the end (200 μL if using the 
185 MBq/mL stock). 
7. Using the dose calibrator, measure the syringe activity noting 
the time A1(t1). 
8. Prepare the [14 C]substrates by defrosting an aliquot and add-
ing 200 μL into a 1 mL syringe, accounting for ~60 μL dead 
volume, and place a Luer tip syringe cap on the end. Handle 
14 C over a containment tray to limit contamination in case of a 
spill. 
3.4 
Dual 
Radionuclide 
Injection 
1. Remove the syringe containing heparinized saline from the end 
of the cannula; remove the luer tip cap from the 18 F syringe and 
place to one side. Place the 18 F syringe on the end of the 
cannula taking care not to introduce air into the injection 
volume. 
2. Inject 
the 
mouse 
with 
radiotracer 
over 
a 
period 
of 
approximately 3 s. 
3. Remove the 18 F syringe and replace the luer tip cap. Put the 
syringe containing heparinized saline back into the cannula 
again taking care not to introduce air, and ﬂush the cannula 
with 50 μL of heparinized saline. 
4. Measure the remaining radioactivity within the activity syringe 
noting the time, A2(t2). 
5. Remove the luer tip cap from the 14 C syringe, and place to one 
side. Place the 14 C syringe on the end of the cannula. 
6. Inject the mouse with radiotracer over a period of about 3 s. 
7. Remove the 14 C syringe and replace the luer tip cap. Put the 
syringe containing heparinized saline back into the cannula 
again taking care not to introduce air, and ﬂush the cannula 
with 50 μL of heparinized saline. 
8. The relative timing of the [14 C] and [18 F]substrates injections 
and animal cull is dependant of the kinetics of each tracer (see 
Note 5). 
9. Florescent agents (e.g., Hoechst 33342; 3 mg/mL, intrave-
nous at 5 mL/kg in saline), pimonidazole (12 mg/mL, 
injected intravenous at 5 mL/kg in saline), and bromodeox-
yuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneal at 5 mL/ 
kg in saline) can also be injected, providing additional mapping

of perfusion, hypoxia, and proliferation, respectively. Hoechst 
33342, pimonidazole, and BrdU can be injected 2, 60, and 
90 min prior to animal cull, respectively. 
10. The total volume of multiple injections should adhere to prac-
tical and welfare limits (see Note 6). 
3.5 
Necropsy and 
Tissue Freezing 
1. Fill a 200 mL steel beaker with 50–100 mL of isopentane 
(2-methylbutane), and place on dry ice. Use a thermometer 
to check that temperate is less than -50 °C. If the isopentane is 
warm, place dry ice pellets directly into the liquid (see Note 7). 
2. Cool a pair of blunt forceps by placing them, tips ﬁrst, into dry 
ice. These chilled forceps will be used to remove the frozen 
tissue from the isopentane. 
3. Cull the mouse by a method approved by local and national 
guidelines (usually cervical dislocation or CO2 overdose). 
4. Conﬁrm euthanasia, splay, and pin the mouse to a dissection 
board, either in the supine or prone position, depending on the 
location of the tissue of interest. Remove relevant tissues by 
creating an incision and performing blunt dissection to expose 
and then remove the tissue of interest. 
5. Carefully drop the piece of tissue directly into steel beaker 
containing isopentane on dry ice (Fig. 3a). When dropping 
the tissue, do not let it touch the sides of the beaker, as these 
will cause the tissue to freeze and adhere to the side causing 
damage. Small tissues (<200 mg) should be placed in a cryo-
mold, which is then ﬁlled with optimal cutting temperature 
(OCT) compound prior to freezing. 
6. Once the isopentane bubbling has ceased, usually about 30 s, 
remove the tissue using the chilled forceps and place it on a 
square 5 × 5 cm piece of aluminum foil on dry ice, allowing 
excess isopentane to drain and evaporate (Fig. 3b). Remove the 
tissue promptly as leaving in isopentane can cause the tissue 
block to fracture. 
7. Wrap the tissue in aluminum foil and place inside a small grip 
seal bag with the experimental details written on the outside in 
permanent marker and return to dry ice. 
8. Repeat for further tissues and animals. 
9. The tissue needs to be cryosectioned rapidly (within 2 h) due to 
the short half-life of 18 F. 
10. Transfer the tissue to the cryostat to warm to the appropriate 
cutting temperature. This may take up to 30 min (see Note 8).

1. Prior to use, place all cryosectioning tools (i.e., knives, brushes, 
specimen stage, blunt forceps, and razor blades) in the cryostat. 
2. Remove tissue from grip seal bag and aluminum foil, setting it 
aside. 
3. Place the specimen stage (i.e., chuck) on the quick-freezing 
shelf, and apply about 1 mL of OCT compound onto it. 
4. Using chilled forceps, hold the tissue perpendicular to the 
desired cutting plane and place it onto the OCT/specimen 
stage. Allow the OCT to harden for approximately one minute 
(Fig. 3c). 
5. Wait an additional 2 min until OCT is fully hardened, and then 
transfer the tissue block and stage to the specimen head. Secure 
into position by tightening the screw.

6. Insert a new knife blade into the knife holder and secure it. Be 
careful as the knife blades are very sharp and can cause serious 
injury if mishandled. 
7. Ensure the knife holder, specimen holder, anti-roll system, and 
all clamps are securely locked into position. Any movement of 
the knife assembly or specimen except through the cutting 
wheel can disrupt accurate sectioning. 
8. Advance the motorised stage towards the knife block using the 
course feed until it is almost touching the blade. Align the 
specimen at the blade’s height as you advance the stage. 
9. Set the trimming thickness to 30 μm, and manually advance the 
trimming wheel until it begins to cut the tissue. Continue 
turning the wheel and cutting sections until you reach the 
region of interest. 
10. Change the section thickness to 10 μm (see Note 9). 
11. Continue turning the cutting wheel until you are close to the 
region of interest. Lock the wheel and clear away section debris 
with a large brush. 
12. Align the guide-plate (anti-roll system) angle towards the knife 
so that they both end at the same position (Fig. 3d). 
13. Cut a section by turning the hand wheel in a steady, constant 
motion, observing the cut section emerging between the guide 
plate and the knife holder (Fig. 3e). 
14. Use the tissue brushes to move the section into a central 
position on the knife holder and ﬂatten any folds (Fig. 3f). 
15. In a single motion, thaw mount the section onto a clean 
microscope slide by placing the slide directly onto the knife 
holder (Fig. 3g). 
16. Place the section on a rack to air dry. 
17. For additional analyses like immunohistochemistry, in situ 
hybridization, 
or 
mass 
spectrometry 
imaging, 
cut 
sec-
tions accordingly, air dry 
them rapidly and store them in a 
slide box within the cryostat to preserve molecular integrity. 
18. Continue cutting and lifting sections until the tissue of interest 
is sufﬁciently sampled. 
19. Place cut sections, once dry, in an autoradiography cassette, 
starting from the bottom left-hand corner, making sure all the 
slides are lying ﬂat and uncovered (see Note 10). 
20. To perform absolute quantiﬁcation, include a slide with refer-
ence autoradiogram standards. 
21. Position a recently erased storage phosphor screen against the 
slides with the phosphor side down in one smooth motion. 
22. Firmly close the cassette, ensuringthat the clips are in place.

435
23. Place the cassette in a secure location for exposure, away from 
potential movement and exogenous sources of radioactivity. 
24. Allow the screen to remain there for up to three half-lives 
(about 6 h) or overnight at room temperature. 
25. Remove the screen and scan the latent image on a storage 
phosphor imager at 25 μm resolution using the red laser and 
open ﬁlter. 
26. Erase the storage phosphor screen using the screen eraser. 
27. Leave the slides for 48 h to allow for complete radioactive 18 F 
decay. 
28. Erase the screen again and place it on the slides in a closed 
cassette in a secure location where the cassette will not be 
moved or exposed to exogenous radiation for an additional 
30 days at room temperature (see Note 3). 
29. After 30 days, scan the screen again on a Typhoon imager using 
the same settings as previously used. 
30. Erase the phosphor screen prior to storage. 
31. Stain the sections using standard haematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E; Fig. 1a, b). 
32. For further analyses such as IHC, IF, ISH, or other spatial 
analysis methods like mass spectrometry imaging or spatial 
transcriptomics, use serial frozen sections. 
3.7 
Image Analysis
1. Begin by qualitatively comparing the resultant autoradiograms 
to the underlying pathology observed from H&E sections. 
2. Mark out regions of distinct pathology on H&E sections in 
consultation with a pathologist (Fig. 1a) [2]. 
3. Compare areas of high and low radiotracer uptake to the 
pathology map and determine uptake in distinct pathological 
types using relative (ratiometric) or absolute quantiﬁcation. 
4. For relative quantiﬁcation, calculate target-to-reference ratios 
using the following formula (see Note 11): 
TRR = I t - I b 
I r - I b 
ð3Þ 
TRR—target-to-reference ratio; It—image intensity in the tar-
get region; Ib—image intensity in the background region (out-
side the tissue); Ir—image intensity in the reference region. 
5. Measure target-to-reference ratios for the same regions on both 
14 C and 18 F autoradiograms. Determine the relative radio-
tracer uptake in distinct regions. 
6. For absolute quantiﬁcation, establish a linear calibration curve 
from the autoradiogram standards using the pixel intensity and 
known 
radioactive 
concentrations 
(Fig. 
2a). 
Use 
this

calibration curve to convert the pixel intensity in the regions of 
interest into absolute radioactive concentration. Normalize the 
radioactive concentration to the injected activity and animal 
body to generate a “standardized uptake value” in a similar way 
to PET quantiﬁcation. 
7. For multiplex quantiﬁcation, determine the overlap of autora-
diograms and IF signals by thresholding. Create binary masks 
using an appropriate cut-off value to distinguish positive and 
negative signals. 
8. Analyze the total area of tracer uptake or cell regions and 
spatially compare the different regions to determine the relative 
radiotracer uptake in various cell types within the tissue section 
using ImageJ. Visualise the results with a proportional Venn or 
Euler diagram representing the areas and overlaps (Fig. 1b) [7]. 
9. For microdistribution analysis, accurately coregister multiplex 
autoradiograms and IF images using commercially available 
programming software or freeware. Analyse each image at the 
pixel-by-pixel level to compare the radiotracer microdistribu-
tion to the underlying perfusion, hypoxia, or protein staining 
(Figs. 1b, d, and 2c) [3].

Notes 
1. The radioactive dose required for 14 C substrates depends on 
the retention of the 14 C in the target tissue, where a substantial 
fraction is oxidised and/or excreted the injected dose may need 
to be increased. To increase signal-to-noise in 14 C autoradi-
ography, the storage phosphor screen can be exposed for lon-
ger period; however, due to cosmic radiation (increasing 
background) and dark-decay of the stored image (decreasing 
signal), this reaches an effective plateau after a few months. 
2. Do not use OCT compound as an embedding media when 
combining autoradiography tissues sections and mass spec-
trometry imaging, as OCT suppresses ionization particularly 
for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrom-
etry (MALDI). Improved hydrogel embedding matrices com-
posed
of
hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose
and 
polyvinylpyrrolidone 
support 
multiplexing 
applications 
involved mass spectrometry imaging [8]. 
3. Phosphor screens from Cytiva (previously Amersham/GE 
Healthcare) are supplied as three main types: MS (multiple 
purpose standard), TR (tritium), and SR (super resolution). 
The SR screens are required for pixel resolutions of 50 μm  or  
less and, except for tritium, are recommended for all autoradi-
ography applications.

4. The required injected dose for 18 F is dependent on the number 
of experimental animals and the tissue processing time. For 
every additional 109.7 min (half-life of 18 F), the injected dose 
should be doubled to provide equivalent signal-to-noise in the 
resultant autoradiograms. Animals injected at different times 
but placed on the same imaging plate should be injected with 
the same stock solution and volume, not the same radioactive 
dose, this will ensure that the autoradiography intensities are 
comparable between animals. 
5. The timing of [14 C] and [18 F]substrate injections should be 
determined for individual radiotracers. The optimal time to cull 
an animal and perform autoradiography is when there is maxi-
mal radionuclide retention in the metabolic pool of interest, 
while other pools are at a minimum. This may be different from 
the peak uptake time or even peak contrast time (peak target-
to-background). For [14 C]acetate and [18 F]FDG, we have 
established optimal times of 90 min post injection, appropriate 
methods 
for 
determining 
the 
optimal 
uptake 
time 
are 
described [9]. 
6. The volume of individual intravenous boluses should not 
exceed the maximal dose volumes for a single injection in that 
species (i.e., 10 mL/kg for mice and 5 mL/kg for rats). The 
total volume of multiple injections should be the minimum 
required for formulation and accurate dosing, and the total 
volume and frequency should not exceed the equivalent maxi-
mal infusion rates (i.e., 0.04 mL/min for mice and 0.2 mL/ 
min for rats) [10]. 
7. Rapid freezing of tissue for autoradiography is essential to 
preserve morphology and prevent the formation of ice crystal 
artifacts. Isopentane is preferable as a freezing media as it 
maintains effective contact with the tissue during freezing. 
Snap freezing warm tissue in liquid nitrogen produces a gas 
layer that slows down tissue freezing. 
8. Set the cryostat to the appropriate temperature depending on 
the fat content of the tissue; -20 °C is a good starting point for 
most tissues. Cut tissues with higher fat content at lower 
temperature than those with higher water content. 
9. The spatial resolution and signal in autoradiography is depen-
dent on the tissue thickness. Thick sections will have poorer 
spatial resolution compared to thin sections, but thin sections 
will have less signal. In practice, 10 μm is a good compromise 
between these factors while preserving tissue morphology for 
pathology and other in situ tissue analysis. For comparable 
quantitative analysis, it is essential to cut all sections at the 
same thickness.

10. Some protocols suggest covering the slides with plastic ﬁlm to 
prevent contamination of the storage phosphor screen. The SR 
screen has a protective cover to allow for gentle decontamina-
tion so further covering is not necessary, so additional covering 
should be avoided as it can degrade the signal and resolution. 
11. The background region is an area on the slide that contains no 
tissue. Subtracting the background from the target and refer-
ence regions equates to removing the background noise on the 
imaging plate. The reference region however, should be 
located within the tissue image but distinct from the area of 
interest. This region can either be an area with no target 
uptake, such as the cerebellum for neuroreceptor radiotracers 
or an area of consistent update that is not affected by your 
intervention (e.g., liver for FDG studies if the liver is not 
altered in your experimental and control groups). The refer-
ence region normalizes the signal to varying tissue exposure, 
accounting for radiotracer injection, body weight, and the 
exposure time. This ratiometric method provides a simple 
semiquantitative parameter for tracer uptake.

Abstract 
There is an expanding number of applications for preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 
Kinetic modeling of PET data provides rich multiparameter information on radiotracer uptake and binding 
in tissue from a single experiment. In this chapter, we provide a practical step-by-step protocol to assist with 
collection of PET data for kinetic modeling studies in rats and mice.

Introduction 
Kinetic modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
data can be instrumental to assess and quantify radiotracer kinetics 
in vivo via mathematical models that describe the mechanism of 
radiotracer uptake and binding following their intravenous admin-
istration [1]. Although the mathematical principles of kinetic mod-
eling are fundamentally translatable across species, radiotracer 
kinetics should be characterized for each preclinical species sepa-
rately due to known physiological differences that can affect kinetic 
modeling outputs [2]. 
Typically, the radiotracer’s biodistribution and kinetics in tissue 
can be quantiﬁed using dynamic PET imaging combined with 
arterial blood data collection, including arterial input function 
and plasma free fraction ( fp). In PET research, fP describes the 
fraction of a radiotracer that is unbound to plasma proteins and is 
therefore available for binding to the target. A simple and practical 
method to measure fP in rodent plasma is described in the methods 
section below.

Alternatively, input functions may be derived from the dynamic 
PET images themselves by drawing of volumes of interest (VOIs) in 
a large vessel or using the left ventricle blood pool, as opposed to 
invasive arterial blood collections. However, when using small 
animals such as mice and rats, this VOI-based approach can be 
quantitatively biased versus invasive blood collection owing to the 
small size of the animal. This small size can impact the VOI mea-
surements due to PET recovery coefﬁcient limits and may require 
additional corrections [3]. Although blood sampling over time 
during PET scanning is typically the gold standard for PET kinetic 
modeling, it also presents with its challenges due to the limited 
blood volume of mice and rats. Automated blood sampling equip-
ment with peristaltic pumps allows for continuous sampling of the 
arterial blood through a cannula, followed by reinjection through 
the venous cannula, while preserving the balance of blood volumes 
due to low volumes sampled, which is beneﬁcial in preclinical 
studies [2, 4]. An alternative to invasive kinetic models that require 
blood measurements includes reference tissue models that can be 
used when a region devoid of radiotracer binding is available [5] 
(see Note 1). 
When investigating the kinetics of a radiotracer in vivo, it is 
essential to gain an understanding on how it is distributed and how 
it binds to its target in the body. The binding potential of radio-
tracers that reversibly bind to their target, or in vivo speciﬁc bind-
ing, can be calculated from the binding associated with the target of 
the radiotracer and its binding to nonspeciﬁc sites or components 
combined with the rest of the available or “free” radiotracer, that is, 
the binding potential relative to nondisplaceable binding (BPND) 
[6, 7]. Another important outcome measure from kinetic modeling 
analysis is the volume of distribution (VT), which describes the 
distribution volume of total radiotracer uptake in tissue relative to 
total concentration of radiotracer in plasma. 
VT and BPND of a radiotracer in vivo can be calculated by using 
compartmental kinetic models or graphical methods of analysis. 
One-tissue compartment model is the simplest compartmental 
model and only derives two rate constants: the rate at which the 
tracer accumulates in the target tissue when transferred from 
plasma (K1) and its retransfer from target tissue after being dis-
placed or no longer bound (k2)  [6] (Fig. 1a). In this case, radio-
tracer kinetics exchange within the tissue compartments (free, 
nonspeciﬁc, and speciﬁc) cannot be distinguished. Alternatively, 
the two-tissue compartment model allows for the distinction 
between free and nonspeciﬁc (together nondisplaceable) compared 
to speciﬁcally bound radiotracer in the tissue compartment 
(Fig. 1b). In the two-tissue compartment model, there are two 
additional rate constants that are important: k3 and k4, which 
describe the two-way transfer of radiotracer from the ﬁrst compart-
ment of the tissue to the compartment that is speciﬁcally bound.

Graphical analysis methods include the Patlak and Logan plots, 
which can be used for radiotracers that bind their targets irrevers-
ibly and reversibly, respectively, and provide an estimation of radio-
tracer uptake over time [8–10]. There are many more mathematical 
models available to describe PET radiotracer kinetics, and the 
selection of which model to use depends on various factors, includ-
ing radiotracer target, organ physiology, and the research question.

The selection of best model to ﬁt PET data can be further 
guided by mathematical and statistical analysis. For example, the 
Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) values are often used to describe 
the goodness of ﬁt of kinetic models and assist with model choice. 
Other selection criteria can also be implemented, such as AIC 
unbiased, Schwartz Criterion, Model Selection Criterion, and 
F-test [11, 12]. It can also be useful to assess the ﬁtting residuals 
plot and the estimate error per rate constant and outcome mea-
sures, in order to select the most appropriate model to quantify a 
given PET dataset. 
This chapter provides a practical guide on how to conduct PET 
kinetic modeling experiments in small animals, namely, rats 
and mice.

Methods 
3.1 
Cannulation of 
Femoral Vessels 
1. Place animal inside the induction chamber preﬁlled with anes-
thetic agent (2–2.5% isoﬂurane in 50/50 O2/N2O mixture). 
2. Once the animal is unresponsive, remove it from the chamber 
and immediately transfer to the heat mat, and place its head 
inside a facemask with anesthetic set at 2–2.5% isoﬂurane in 
50/50 O2/N2O mixture. Place the anesthetized animal on a 
heat mat to maintain temperature within physiological range. 
3. Shave the targeted surgical area on the rodent hind limb to be 
cannulated. Then disinfect the surgical area, lift a small portion 
of the skin, and make a small incision between the abdominal 
body wall and the hind limb. 
4. Introduce the scissors through the incision and expand incision 
by gently opening and closing the scissors several times, in 
order to cut through muscle and connective tissue and until 
sufﬁcient space is created to gain access and clearly visualize the 
femoral artery and vein. 
5. With the help of a surgical microscope and cotton buds, thor-
oughly clean the incision wound of any remaining connective 
tissue. This procedure can be done by extending the connective 
tissue repeatedly until it breaks and there is a clear access to the 
femoral artery and vein. 
6. Slowly and gently introduce the tip of the forceps between the 
femoral artery and the vein. Then separate both vessels by 
opening and closing the forceps to fully disrupt the connective 
tissue between the femoral vein and artery. 
7. Tie a ligature around the caudal end of the vein, and attach a 
bulldog clamp to the ligature loose ends. 
8. Place a 4–6 mm vessel clamp onto the cranial end of the vein to 
stop blood ﬂow. Care should be taken to avoid clamping any of 
the surrounding tissue. Place the clamp in such a position that 
it will allow for maximal length of the accessible vein. 
9. Place two loose ligatures around the vein adjacent to the clamp. 
10. Make a small incision using 2 mm Vannas spring micro ﬁne 
scissors in the vein next to the tied ligature, leaving sufﬁcient 
space to allow insertion of the cannula. 
11. Using the tip of the bevel, gently lift the incision and guide the 
cannula into the vein until levelled with the vessel clamp. The 
opposite end of the cannula should be connected to a 1 mL 
syringe ﬁlled with 1 mL of heparinized saline. 
12. Tie the cannula in place using the two loose ligatures. Two 
ligatures are required due to the pressure on the tubing from 
the blood ﬂow.

rat. The blood can be seen in the tubing, indicating successful cannulation 
13. Remove the bulldog clamp from the end of the ligature and 
secure the loose ends around the cannula tubing. 
14. Remove the vessel clamp. Pull back the plunger of the syringe 
attached to the catheter. At this point, venous blood should 
ﬂow into the cannula (Fig. 2). 
15. If performing unilateral cannulation, repeat Steps 6–13 with 
the femoral artery. If performing bilateral cannulation, repeat 
Steps 2–13 with the femoral artery on another hind limb. 
16. For additional stability of the cannula inside blood vessel, apply 
a few drops of surgical glue on the cannula and blood vessel 
interface. 
3.2 
Manual Blood 
Sampling 
1. Cannulate 
a 
femoral 
artery 
for 
blood 
sampling 
(see 
Subheading 3.1). 
2. Cannulate a tail vein and secure the cannula in place with tape. 
This site will be used for the injection of the radiotracer. 
3. Carefully but swiftly, transfer the animal onto a PET scanner 
bed and place the head inside the anesthetic facemask for 
continual general anesthesia. 
4. Following radiotracer injection via tail vein, manually collect 
arterial blood samples (mouse: 10 μL; rat: 50 μL) in short time 
intervals up to 5 min post injection (10–30 s interval) and in 
longer time intervals after 5 min post injection until the end of 
a PET scan (e.g., for a 2 h PET scan, this would be 5, 10, 
15, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min). Place blood samples on ice 
and analyze immediately.

blood sampling system. In this example, bilateral femoral cannulation is shown 
5. Measure the activity in the whole blood using a gamma 
counter. Then centrifuge whole blood at 2000 × g for 5 min 
at 4 °C to obtain plasma and measure its activity using a gamma 
counter. 
3.3 
Automated Blood 
Sampling System 
(ABSS) Method 
1. Cannulate the femoral artery and vein (see Subheading 3.1). 
This procedure can be done either unilaterally (i.e., both artery 
and vein cannulated on the same leg) or bilaterally (i.e., arterial 
cannulation on one leg and venous on another; see Fig. 3). 
Whenever possible, the unilateral method is preferred, as it 
would provide the possibility for acquisition of invasive input 
function data from the same rodent in two different occasions 
using one limb per PET experiment. 
2. Carefully transfer the animal onto a PET scanner bed, and place 
its head inside an anesthetic facemask for continued general 
anesthesia. 
3. Prior to connecting the catheters to the ABSS (see Note 2), 
move the scanner bed to the position required for PET imag-
ing. Then connect both arterial and venous catheters to ABSS. 
4. Make sure that the ﬂow rate of the peristaltic pump is set to 
mimic the blood ﬂow of the species that is being imaged. 
Switch the pump on and inspect for any air bubbles in the 
tubing, obstructed blood ﬂow, and leaks at the sites of cannu-
lation (see Notes 3–5).

5. Inject the radiotracer using a 3-way tap connected to the 
venous catheter line attached to the ABSS, while the radioactive 
concentration in arterial blood coming out of arterial line is 
measured by the ABSS continuously throughout the duration 
of the PET scan (see Note 6). 
3.4 
Image-Derived 
Input Function (IDIF) 
and Reference Tissue 
Method 
1. Cannulate a tail vein and secure the cannula in place with tape. 
This site will be used for injection of the radiotracer. 
2. Carefully but swiftly, transfer the animal onto the PET scanner 
bed, and place the head inside the anesthetic cone for 
continued general anesthesia. 
3.5 
PET Image 
Acquisition and 
Reconstruction 
1. Insert a rectal temperature probe and attach respiration rate 
recorder for monitoring of vital signs throughout PET 
scanning. 
2. Inject the radiotracer and start PET data acquisition in a syn-
chronous manner. 
3. Acquire dynamic emission images using standard protocols. 
4. If your PET system is coupled with a CT system, then perform 
CT scan for attenuation correction and anatomical informa-
tion. If your PET system is coupled with a MRI system, per-
form an MRI scan for anatomical information and generation 
of pseudo-attenuation maps (see Note 7). 
5. Reconstruct the PET image using standard protocols and 
upload it onto the kinetic modeling software. 
3.6 
Radiometabolite 
Corrections (See Note 
8) 
1. Induce and maintain general anesthesia. 
2. Cannulate one femoral artery (see Subheading 3.1). 
3. Cannulate a tail vein and secure the cannula in place with tape. 
This site will be used for injection of a radiotracer. 
4. Insert a rectal temperature probe and attach respiration rate 
recorder for monitoring of vital signs. 
5. Collect arterial blood samples (mouse: 7.2 mL/kg, rat: 
6.4 mL/kg; or check local regulations) at 2, 5, 10, 20, 
30, 60, 120 min post-radiotracer injection (minimum of 
n = 3 per time point). 
6. Immediately, place blood samples on ice and measure radioac-
tivity in the whole blood samples using a gamma counter. 
7. Centrifuge whole blood at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C t  
separate whole blood from plasma. 
8. Take a plasma sample and measure its radioactivity using a 
gamma counter (see Note 9). 
9. Cull animals at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 min post-radiotracer 
injection (minimum of n = 3 per time point).

10. Dissect the target organs, place them on ice, and process 
immediately. 
11. Place each organ in a separate tube, add distilled water in a w/v 
ﬁxed 
ratio, 
and 
homogenize 
samples 
using 
a 
tissue 
homogenizer. 
12. Add 1.4 × volume of 100% acetonitrile to plasma and organ 
homogenate samples and vortex brieﬂy. 
13. Centrifuge the samples at 2000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. 
14. Collect the supernatant in an HPLC vial, and inject the sample 
onto HPLC with a ﬁtted radiodetector (see Notes 10–13). 
15. In order to quantify the parent fraction, integrate all peaks in the 
radiochromatogram and calculate percentage relative area occu-
pied by parent (i.e., unmetabolised radiotracer) and metabolites 
(see examples of radio-HPLC chromatograms in Fig. 4). 
16. For population-based input functions, correct the whole blood 
activity measurements obtained using a gamma counter for 
decay and sample volume. Then convert the gamma counter 
output units to kBq/mL and normalize the values to injected 
activity. Plot normalized whole blood kBq/mL values over 
time to generate a population-based input function (see 
Note 14). 
17. To calculate plasma-to-whole blood ratios, correct the whole 
blood and plasma activity measurements obtained using a 
gamma counter for decay and sample volume. Then convert 
the gamma counter output units to kBq/mL, and normalize 
the values to injected activity. Divide plasma values by matched 
whole blood values and plot the ratio over time. Fit an expo-
nential curve to estimate plasma-to-whole blood ratio at any 
given time point between 2 and 120 min post injection of the 
radiotracer. 
3.7 
Plasma-Free 
Fraction Corrections 
1. Collect an arterial blood sample from a rodent (mouse: 
7.2 mL/kg; rat: 6.4 mL/kg). Place the test tube with sample 
on ice, and process it immediately. 
2. Add a few microliters of a radiotracer to the arterial blood 
sample, and stir very gently using a pipette tip or by gentle 
inversion of the blood in the test tube. 
3. Centrifuge radiotracer-spiked whole blood sample at 2000 × g 
for 5 min at 4 °C to separate plasma. 
4. Collect a plasma sample and measure the activity using a 
gamma counter. Note the plasma sample volume. 
5. Load an ultraﬁltration unit with the plasma sample and centri-
fuge at 3000 × g for 20 min at 20 °C. Carefully follow the 
ultraﬁltration unit loading instructions provided by the 
manufacturer.

6. Collect a sample of the ultraﬁltrate (i.e., protein-free plasma 
fraction, or serum), and measure the activity using a gamma 
counter. Make sure to note the ultraﬁltrate sample volume. 
7. Correct the plasma and ultraﬁltrate values for decay and nor-
malise for sample volume. Then estimate the fP by dividing 
ultraﬁltrate values by plasma values.
3.8 
Image Analysis 
and Kinetic Modeling 
1. Delineate volumes of interest (VOIs) using PET/CT image 
analysis software, extract the information in each VOI as time 
activity curves, and upload it to kinetic modeling software. 
2. To generate an IDIF, draw a small homogenous VOI (e.g., 
sphere with 1 mm radius) on a large vessel (e.g., vena cava or 
descending aorta) or in the left ventricle of the heart. 
3. To analyze data using reference tissue methods, select a tissue 
region devoid of target expression to draw your VOI. 
4. For invasive kinetic modeling, upload a whole blood curve, 
which has been generated using manual sampling (individual 
or population curve) or ABSS or has been image-derived. 
Apply plasma-to-whole blood ratio, plasma parent fraction, 
and plasma-free fraction corrections in order to generate an 
arterial input function. 
5. For both invasive and noninvasive kinetic modeling, use model 
selection criteria (e.g., AIC) to choose models that best ﬁt the 
collected data. 
6. Extract the desirable kinetic constants, for example, K1, k2, k3, 
k4, K1/k2, k3/k4 (or BPND), or VT. The choice of which model 
to use for quantiﬁcation of PET data depends on the scientiﬁc 
question, the speciﬁc radiotracer used, and the biological pro-
cess being imaged (see Note 15). 
4 
Notes 
1. When planning PET experiments, a decision should be made 
whether kinetic modeling will be performed using an invasive 
arterial input function sampled manually or using ABSS, or 
whether an image-derived input function or reference tissue 
method will be sufﬁcient for quantiﬁcation of PET data. This 
decision will dictate the preparation procedures for acquisition 
of preclinical PET data using small animals and will depend on 
the radiotracer binding properties, target expression in tissue, 
and experimental research question (Fig. 5). 
2. Make sure that the length and diameter of the catheters used 
for blood sampling from the arterial site into the detector and 
from the detector into the venous site are kept constant across 
all experiments.

3. If an air bubble appears inside the arterial catheter, immediately 
stop the peristaltic pump ﬂow, disconnect the catheter from the 
ABSS, connect a syringe with heparinized saline to the catheter, 
and try removing the air bubble by drawing blood from the 
animal until it ﬁlls the entire catheter. Reattach the tubing to 
the ABSS and turn the pump on again. 
4. If the blood ﬂow is obstructed along the arterial catheter, 
immediately stop the peristaltic pump ﬂow, disconnect the 
catheter from the ABSS, connect a syringe with heparinized 
saline to the catheter, and very gently inject a small amount of 
heparinized saline. This may help to dissolve a blood clot, 
which may sometimes form at the site of cannulation. Then 
try drawing the blood using the same preheparinized syringe. If 
the blood ﬂow obstruction is resolved and blood is now fol-
lowing through the catheter, reconnect the tubing to the ABSS 
and turn on the pump.

454

5. If blood is leaking at the site of cannulation (small leaks only!), 
absorb the blood using a cotton bud and gently press it against 
the wound to stop the leak. Then a few more drops of surgical 
glue may be applied to reinforce stability of surgically placed 
catheters. 
6. Make sure the ABSS detector and the acquisition software are 
switched on prior to injection of the radiotracer. 
7. Do not move the animal between the molecular (PET) and the 
anatomical (CT or MRI) scans. 
8. When performing PET kinetic modeling, one important cor-
rection to be made is a correction for parent in plasma, that is, a 
fraction of unmetabolized radiotracer in plasma throughout 
the period of imaging. Population-based input function and 
plasma-to-whole blood ratio can also be determined during 
radiometabolite experiments by measuring radioactive concen-
tration in blood and plasma with a gamma counter. In Sub-
heading 3.6, we provide an example of a method used for 
quantiﬁcation of radiometabolites in mice and rats when 
using ﬂuorine-18-labelled radiotracers and scanning the ani-
mals for up to 2 h. This protocol can be adapted for longer 
scanning intervals or different radioisotopes by adjusting the 
sampling frequency accordingly. 
9. Whenever possible, use the same volumes for measuring whole 
blood and plasma in the well-type gamma counter to facilitate 
calculation of plasma-to-whole-blood ratio. 
10. The sample volume for HPLC injection should be larger than 
that typical volumes used for analytical purposes (usually at 
least 100 μL). However, these volumes should not exceed the 
loading limits of the loop and HPLC column. 
11. The use of semi-prep columns ﬁtted with guard-columns, as 
opposed to analytical columns, is recommended to minimize 
pressure buildup from injection of nonﬁltered denaturated 
plasma and tissue samples. 
12. Filtration of samples prior to HPLC can increase HPLC col-
umn longevity, but the ﬁlter selected for sample preprocessing 
must not retain the compound of interest on its membrane. 
13. A standard solution (i.e., the radiotracer diluted in mobile 
phase) should be injected with every experiment. 
14. When using the population-based input function for kinetic 
modeling, remember to correct it for injected dose in that 
particular animal. 
15. When selecting the best kinetic model to describe collected 
PET data, use the following criteria: Lowest % standard error 
(%SE) when estimating kinetic constants; or Akaike informa-
tion criteria (AIC): the lower the better; or Schwartz criterion

Kinetic Modeling
455
(SC): the lower the better; or Model selection criterion (MSC): 
the higher the better. An approach typically used when asses-
sing best kinetic model includes comparing AIC between dif-
ferent models and selecting the one with lowest AIC. This 
typically, but not always, translates into the lowest %SE. 
When two models perform equally well, as per AIC, then the 
%SE could be used as second line criteria for model selection. 
Studies comparing pros and cons of different model selection 
criteria for dynamic PET studies have been published, includ-
ing a recent detailed study by Golla et al. [12].
