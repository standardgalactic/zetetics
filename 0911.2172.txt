THE GRONE-MERRIS CONJECTURE
HUA BAI
Abstract. In spectral graph theory, the Grone and Merris conjecture
asserts that the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of a ﬁnite graph is
majorized by the conjugate degree sequence of this graph. We give a
complete proof for this conjecture.
The Laplacian of a simple graph G with n vertices is a positive semi-
deﬁnite n × n matrix L(G) that mimics the geometric Laplacian of a Rie-
mannian manifold; see §1 for deﬁnitions, and [2, 14] for comprehensive bib-
liographies on the graph Laplacian. The spectrum sequence λ(G) of L(G)
can be listed in non-increasing order as
λ1(G) ≥λ2(G) ≥· · · ≥λn−1(G) ≥λn(G) = 0.
For two non-increasing real sequences x and y of length n, we say that x
is majorized by y (denoted x ≼y) if
k
X
i=1
xi ≤
k
X
i=1
yi for all k ≤n, and
n
X
i=1
xi =
n
X
i=1
yi.
This notion was introduced because of the following fundamental theorem.
Theorem 1 (Schur-Horn Dominance Theorem [18, 11]). There exists a
Hermitian matrix H with diagonal entry sequence x and spectrum sequence
y if and only if x ≼y.
□
In particular, if d(G) = (d1, d2, . . . , dn)T is the non-increasing degree se-
quence of G, which coincides the diagonal entry sequence of the Laplacian
matrix L(G), the Schur-Horn Dominance Theorem implies that d(G) ≼
λ(G). Grone [7] improves this majorization result: if G has at least one
edge, then (d1 + 1, d2, . . . , dn−1, dn −1)T ≼λ(G).
For a non-negative integral sequence d, we deﬁne its conjugate degree
sequence as the sequence d′ = (d′
1, d′
2, . . . , d′
n)T where
d′
k := #{i : di ≥k}.
Another important majorization relation is the following.

Theorem 2 (Gale-Ryser [6, 17]). There exists a (0, 1)-matrix A with row
and column sum vectors r and c if and only if r ≼c′.
□
Applying this to the adjacency matrix of G immediately gives that d(G) ≼
d′(G).
In 1994, Grone and Merris [8, 9] raised the natural question whether
the Laplacian spectrum sequence and the conjugate degree sequence are
majorization comparable.
Grone-Merris Conjecture. For any graph G, the Laplacian spectrum is
majorized by the conjugate degree sequence
λ(G) ≼d′(G).
In this paper, we give a complete proof to the Grone-Merris Conjecture.
As a consequence, we have the double majorization d(G) ≼λ(G) ≼d′(G).
See [3] for a partial result in this direction, as well as [19, 12, 13, 1] for
proofs in the special cases. See also [3] for a generalization to simplicial
complexes, which is still open.

1. The Laplacian matrix and the majorization relation
Let G = (V, E) be a simple ﬁnite graph with n = |V | vertices. We write
i ∼j when the i-th vertex is adjacent to the j-th vertex, and we let di
denote the degree of the i-th vertex.
The Laplacian matrix L(G) of the graph G is the n × n matrix deﬁned
by
L(G)ij =



di
if i = j;
−1
if i ∼j;
0
otherwise.
We can also express the Laplacian as L(G) = D−A, where D is the diagonal
matrix deﬁned by the degree sequence, and A is the adjacency (0, 1)-matrix
of the graph.
It is well-known that L(G) is positive semi-deﬁnite, since it corresponds
to the quadratic form
xT L(G)x =
X
i∼j
(xi −xj)2 for x = (x1, . . . , xn)T ∈Rn.
Let λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λn)T be the non-increasing spectrum sequence of the
Laplacian matrix L(G). The smallest eigenvalue is λn = 0, with eigenvector
1n = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T .

Given two vectors x = (x1, . . . , xn)T and y = (y1, . . . , yn)T in Rn, rear-
range their components in non-increasing order as
x[1] ≥x[2] ≥· · · ≥x[n],
y[1] ≥y[2] ≥· · · ≥y[n].
We say that x is majorized by y, and write x ≼y, if
k

x[i] ≤
k

i=1
y[i] for all 1 ≤k ≤n, and
n

We will make use of the following majorization inequality.
Theorem 3 (Fan [4]). If H1 and H2 are Hermitian matrices, then
λ(H1 + H2) ≼λ(H1) + λ(H1).
□
2. Split graphs
A graph is split (also called semi-bipartite in [12]) if its vertices can be
partitioned into a clique V1 and a co-clique V2. This is equivalent to saying
that the subgraph induced by V1 is complete, and that the subgraph induced
by V2 is an independent set. See [5, 20, 15, 10] for many characterizations
and properties of split graphs.
Given a split graph G = (V, E), let N = |V1| be the size of the clique,
and M = |V2| be the size of the co-clique. Let δ(G) be the maximum degree
of vertices in V2. Clearly δ(G) ≤N, and the Laplacian matrix of the split
graph G is of the form
L(G) =
 KN + D1
−A
−AT
D2

,
where KN is the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph on N vertices,
where D1 and D2 are diagonal matrices with diagonal entries the vertex
degrees of V1, V2 respectively, and where A is the adjacency matrix for
edges between V1 and V2.
The Laplacian matrix is symmetric, and therefore Hermitian.
Theorem 4 (Courant-Fischer-Weyl [16]). Let the n × n matrix H be Her-
mitian, with eigenvalues λ1 ≥λ2 ≥· · · ≥λn. Then
λk =

where the max (resp. min) is taken over all k-dimensional (resp. (n−k+1)-
dimensional) subspaces of Rn.

We ﬁrst investigate the Laplacian spectrum of a split graph.
Proposition 5. If G is a split graph of clique size N, then
λN−1(G) ≥N ≥δ(G) ≥λN+1(G).

Moreover, if λN(G) ≥N, then

Proof. To prove the inequalities involving λN−1(G) and λN+1(G) by the
Courant-Fischer-Weyl Min-Max Principle, it suﬃces to ﬁnd an (N −1)-
dimensional (resp. M-dimensional) subspace for which the action of L(G)
has a desirable lower (resp. upper) bound. There are natural candidates.
Let P ⊂RM+N be the (N −1)-dimensional subspace consisting of all
vectors of the form

u
0M

with u ∈RN and u ⊥1N. Then for any unit
vector u ∈Rn,

L(G)

u


,

u
0M

= ⟨(KN + D1)u, u⟩= N + ⟨D1u, u⟩≥N.
Similarly, consider the M-dimensional subspace Q ⊂RM+N consisting of
all vectors of the form

0N
u

with u ∈RM. Then for any unit vector u,

L(G)

0N
u

,

0N
u

= ⟨D2u, u⟩≤δ(G).
This proves our ﬁrst statement part that λN−1(G) ≥N ≥δ(G) ≥λN+1(G).
When λN(G) ≥N, we assert that the degree of any vertex in the clique
V1 is at least N. For this, suppose that our assertion is false, namely that
there exists a vertex v0 ∈V1 with degree less than N. Then this vertex v0
is adjacent to none of the vertices of the co-clique V2. Consequently G can
be regarded as a split graph with new clique V1 \ {v0} and new co-clique
V2 ∪{v0}. The size of the new clique is e
N = N −1. Applying the ﬁrst part
of the proposition, we obtain that
λN(G) = λ e
N+1(G) ≤e
N = N −1,
which is a contradiction.
For a conjugating pair of non-negative integral sequences, the partial sum
of one sequence can be computed in a diﬀerent way as

3. The homotopy method
This section is devoted to proving Lemma 6.
We adopt a homotopy
method, following an idea of Katz [12] in his proof of the Grone-Merris
Conjecture for 1-regular semi-bipartite graph.
Let α ∈[0, 1]. Deﬁne an (M + N) × (M + N) matrix Lα as
Lα = (1 −α)

KN + M
−JN×M
−JM×N
N

+ α
 KN + D1
−A

D2

,
where JM×N denotes the M × N matrix whose entries are all equal to 1.
Note that L1 = L(G) is the matrix we are interested in, and that L0 is the
Laplacian of a complete split graph. The spectrum of L0 is well-understood:
Lemma 7. The Laplacian spectrum of the complete split graph of clique size
N and co-clique size M is
{ (M + N)(N), N (M−1), 0(1) },
where P (Q) denotes Q copies of the number P. The eigenspace corresponding
to the eigenvalue N consists of all vectors of the form

0N
v

, where v is
M-dimensional and v ⊥1M; the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue
(M + N) is spanned by the orthogonal vectors
(0i−1, M + N −i, −1M+N−i)T ,
1 ≤i ≤N.
□
Lemma 8. If λN(G) > N or λN(G) = N > δ(G), then
λ(α)
N+1 ≤N < λ(α)
N
for all 0 ≤α < 1.
Proof. We again make use of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl Min-Max Principle.
Recall that the M-dimensional subspace Q ⊂RM+N consists of all vectors
of the form

0N
u

with u ∈RM. Then for any unit vector u,

Lα

0N
u

,

0N
u

= (1 −α)⟨Nu, u⟩+ α⟨D1(u), u⟩
≤(1 −α)N + αδ(G) ≤N.
Therefore, the (N + 1)-th largest eigenvalue λ(α)
N+1 is at most N.
For the eigenvalue λ(α)
N , let ˜P be the N-dimensional subspace which is
spanned by the eigenvectors of L1 corresponding to the N largest eigenval-
ues. Clearly ˜P ⊥1M+N. For any unit vector v ∈˜P, we know from Lemma

6
HUA BAI
7 that ⟨L0(v), v⟩≥N. Moreover,
⟨Lα(v), v⟩= α⟨L1(v), v⟩+ (1 −α)⟨L0(v), v⟩
≥α λN(G) + (1 −α)N ≥N.
Therefore, the N-th largest eigenvalue λ(α)
N
is at least N.
We next proceed to show that the inequality on λ(α)
N
is strict, when 0 ≤
α < 1. We already know that λ(0)
N = M+N. If λ(α)
N
= N for some 0 < α < 1,
then the above arguments show that necessarily
λN(G) = N,
⟨L1v, v⟩= N, and L0(v) = Nv.
The ﬁrst condition λN(G) = N implies that δ(G) < N, from our assumption
on λN(G); the third condition L0(v) = Nv implies that v is a unit vector in
Ker(L0 −N), thus in turn a unit vector of Q. Then
⟨L1v, v⟩≤δ(G) < N,
which contradicts the second condition ⟨L1v, v⟩= N.
□
We now consider all possible N-dimensional subspaces

IN

⊆(1M+N)⊥,
where V (α) is an M × N matrix. Here the notation of the subspace means

Lemma 9. If the subspace

IN

⊆(1M+N)⊥is an invariant subspace
of Lα, then the matrix V (α) solves the quadratic matrix equation

where the non-negative integers di, fj are the entries of the diagonal matrices

Proof. It is easy to see that the orthogonal complement in RM+N of the

By comparison of the corresponding four block matrices, we immediately

Yα = (1 −α)N + αD2 + [(1 −α)JM×N + αAT ]V (α)T ,

⊥1M+N, the entries of V (α) satisfy that

This condition, in terms of matrices, is equivalent to JN×MV (α) = −JN×N.
This implies that V (α)KN = [N + V (α)JN×M]V (α), with which the above
quadratic matrix equation can be simpliﬁed to

The quadratic matrix equation is complicated, and is almost impossible
to be solved explicitly. Fortunately, we do not have to do so.
From Lemma 8 and the assumption on λN(G), we know that
λ(α)
N+1 ≨λ(α)
N
for all α ∈[0, 1].
Thus the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of Lα corresponding to the
N largest eigenvalues is unique.
Assume that this subspace is given by

According to the algebraic multiplicity of eigenvalues of Lα, there exist

of RM×N. Then V (α) ∈Ωfor all α ∈[0, 1].
Proof. Consider the subset
Γ = {α ∈[0, 1) : V (α) ∈Ω}
of the half-open half-closed interval [0, 1).
When α = 0, v(0)
ji
≡−1
M (see Lemma 7 or Equation (1) ). As a conse-
quence, V (0) ∈Ω, so that 0 ∈Γ and Γ is not empty.
Suppose there is a sequence of points αn ∈Γ and limn→∞αn = α with α
still in [0, 1). By Lemma 10, limn→∞V (αn) = V (α). Because Ωis a compact
set, so V (α) ∈Ωand α ∈Γ. Therefore, Γ is a closed subset of [0, 1).
Suppose α ∈Γ, namely V (α) ∈Ωfor some α ∈[0, 1).
Because the
quantities χ(i ∼j), fj and v(α)
ji′ v(α)
j′i in Equation (1) are all non-negative, we
see that
v(α)
ji
≤
−(1 −α)
(1 −α)M + α(N + di) < 0 for all 1 ≤j ≤M, 1 ≤i ≤N.
Therefore V (α) is contained in the interior of Ω. Since V (α) depends contin-
uously on α, it follows that Γ is an open subset of [0, 1).
The interval [0, 1) is connected, and Γ is an open closed non-empty subset
of it, therefore Γ is equal to [0, 1).
By continuity at α = 1, V (1) is also in Ω. This proves that V (α) ∈Ωfor
all α ∈[0, 1].

4. Proof of Grone-Merris Conjecture
For consistence we restate the Grone-Merris Conjecture here.
Grone-Merris Conjecture. For any graph G, its Laplacian spectrum is
majorized by its conjugate degree sequence, namely λ(G) ≼d′(G).
The Grone-Merris Conjecture behaves nicely under complementation, in
the sense of the proposition below.
The complement graph of a graph G is a graph G on the same vertices
such that two vertices of G are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent
in G. The Laplacian matrices of the graph G and of its complementary
graph G are related by the property that
L(G) + L(G) + Jn = nIn.
All these matrices commute with each other, so that
λ(G) = (n −λn−1(G), . . . , n −λ1(G), 0);
d′(G) = (n −d′
n−1(G), . . . , n −d′
1(G), 0).
From these we see that
Proposition 12. For any 1 ≤k < n, the k-th inequality holds for the graph
G if and only if the (n −k −1)-th inequality holds for the complement graph
G.

Assume that the Grone-Merris Conjecture is not true, and the graph
G = (V, E) is a counterexample. Namely, there exists an integer k with
1 < k < n = |V |, such that
k
X
i=1
λi >
k
X
i=1
d′
i.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that this integer k is minimum
over all counterexamples. Then we have
k−1

i=1
λi ≤
k−1
X
i=1
d′
i,
and
λk > d′
k.
Moreover, we can further assume that the number |E| of edges is minimum
over all counterexamples with the same k. Under this assumption, we claim
that
Lemma 13. For any two vertices i, j in the graph G, if di ≤k and dj ≤k,
then they are not adjacent in G.
Proof. We will prove this by contradiction. Assuming that the lemma is
false, namely there exists a pair of vertices such that
di ≤k,
dj ≤k,
i ∼j.
Let eG be the graph obtained from G by deleting the edge ij. Due to the
minimum property of |E|, we must have
k
X
i=1
λi( eG) ≤
k
X
i=1
d′
i( eG).
Two Laplacian matrices are related via L(G) = L( eG)+H, where Hn×n is a
positive semi-deﬁnite matrix whose only non-zero entries are Hii = Hjj = 1
and Hij = Hji = −1. Applying Fan’s Theorem 3, we see that
k

λi(G) ≤

This contradicts our assumption that G was a counterexample, and there-
fore concludes the proof.

Next, we add new edges to G to get a new graph bG. Add to G a new
edge ij for any pair of vertices i, j in G such that
di ≥k, dj ≥k, and i ≁j.
The new graph bG so obtained is a split graph.
The clique of bG consists of all vertices of G whose degree is at least k,
so the size of the clique is equal to d′
k(G). Let N = d′
k(G) denote this size.
The co-clique consists of all vertices of G whose degree is less than k, so the
maximum degree of vertices in the co-clique is δ( bG) ≤k −1.
Note that

while λi( bG) ≥λi(G) for all 1 ≤i ≤n, so these two inequalities are still valid
for the new graph bG, namely
k
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
k
X
i=1
d′
i( bG)
and
λk( bG) > d′
k( bG) = N.
Let us discuss the relationship between N and k.
If N < k, then λk( bG) ≤λN+1( bG) ≤N, which leads to a contradiction.
The second inequality comes from Proposition 5.
If N = k, then bG is a split graph of clique size N, with the property that
N
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
N
X
i=1
d′
i( bG)
and
λN( bG) > N.
This contradicts Lemma 6.
So k < N. Note that bG is a split graph of clique size N. In this graph
bG, the maximum degree of vertices in the co-clique is at most (k −1), while
the minimum degree of vertices in the clique is at least (N −1). This means
that
d′
N−1( bG) = · · · = d′
k+1( bG) = d′
k( bG) = N.
Combining this with λk+1( bG) ≥. . . ≥λN−1( bG) ≥N from Proposition 5,
we see immediately that the inequality
k
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
k
X
i=1
d′
i( bG) can be extended to
N−1
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
N−1
X
i=1
d′
i( bG).
Then we proceed to compare λN( bG) with the clique size N.
First consider the case where λN( bG) ≥N. Because N = d′
N−1( bG) ≥
d′
N( bG), the split graph bG has clique size N, with the additional property
that
N
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
N
X
i=1
d′
i( bG)
and
λN( bG) ≥N > δ( bG).
This again contradicts Lemma 6.
In the other case, where λN( bG) < N, we switch attention to the com-
plement graph of bG. This complement graph is another split graph bG. Its
clique size is M, and
λM( bG) = (N + M) −λN( bG) > M.
According to Proposition 12,
N−1
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
N−1

i( bG)
=⇒

λi( bG) >

THE GRONE MERRIS CONJECTURE

Therefore, bG is a split graph of clique size M, with the additional property
that
M
X
i=1
λi( bG) >
M
X
i=1
d′
i( bG)
and
λM( bG) > M.
This again contradicts Lemma 6.
All possible cases are eliminated, and the Grone-Merris Conjecture is
proved.
