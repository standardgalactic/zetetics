Section Three
Categorical Syllogistic
1 Preliminary Remark
In contrast to the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogistic, the categorical syllogistic
has to do with rules of inferring from propositions that are not logically composite.
The rules of the categorical syllogistic depend therefore not on definitions which fix
the meaning of propositional connectives, but rather on definitions which fix the
meaning of expressions used to logically connect concept expressions.

§ 51 Notation
In this section the signs which were introduced in § 42 and § 46 will be put to
further use, as well as the following signs being added:
(1) Letter symbols: ‘α1, . . ., αn’ as concept variables (i.e., as substitutes for terms).
I abbreviate by replacing the first four concept variables ‘α1’, ‘α2’, ‘α3’, and ‘α4’
with ‘α’, ‘β’, ‘γ’, and ‘δ’.
(2) Logical constants: ‘A (. . ., . . .)’, ‘I (. . ., . . .)’, and ‘Ạ(. . ., . . .)’ for two-place
relations in which the concept variables appear in the empty places, as well
as ‘N. . . ’ to designate antonyms.
§ 52 Definitions
1. A is a formula of the categorical syllogistic if and only if A satisfies one of the
following conditions: (a) A takes the form of a universal, particular, or singular
affirmative proposition, or (b) A is a negatable expression (in the sense of § 43) and
equals N B or NN C, and B and C each take the form of a universal, particular, or
singular affirmative proposition.
Scholium: Categorical propositions are not truth functions, because they can-
not be reduced to simpler propositions, and if they are propositions of the form
N A, they do not contain a truth-functional negation. The truth of affirmative cate-
gorical propositions consists in their correspondence with the objects they deal
with. This correspondence presupposes that these objects exist, or in any case
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-007

belong to the ‘world of attributions’ in the sense of § 20. The truth of negative cate-
gorical propositions is independent of such a presupposition.191
2. A is a universally affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form A (α, β)
(in words: every β is an α), if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in
which A is a true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if
β is not an empty concept (thus, some object which falls under the concept β is a β
after all) and moreover, if any object – whether it falls under an arbitrary concept
γ or δ or whatever other concept – falls under the concept β, this very object γ
also falls under the concept α; (2) A is false if and only if N A (= O (α, β)) is true
and NN A = N O (α, β) is false (so that an arbitrary concept – call it γ or δ or whatever
else – can be formed for which it holds that: no object that falls under it falls under
the concept α, but there is an object that falls under it, and the latter falls under the
concept β if there is in that case some object at all that falls under the concept β).
Corollary to definition 2: If a proposition of the form A (α, β) is false, so that N A
(α, β) is true, according to definition 2 this means that β is an empty concept or it is
not true that, if some object which falls under an arbitrary concept γ also falls under
the concept β, this object γ falls under the concept α. This means: if N A (α, β) is true,
then a concept γ – e.g., the concept of a β that is not an α – can be formed for which
it holds that: there is, in case β is not an empty concept (so that some object that falls
under the concept β is a β), an object that falls under the concept γ, and this same
object γ also then falls under the concept β, but no object that falls under the concept
γ falls under the concept α.
I here make use of one of the ideas which I developed in Section Three of Part I (especially in
§ 32), namely the idea that the universal form of the categorical proposition cannot be rendered
in the language of the calculus of functions, and that it must be characterized by what I called
‘qualitative existential import’. This idea also seems to me to be compatible with the conception of
the categorical proposition in Aristotle. By contrast, Günther Patzig (1969, 47–48) cannot find sup-
port in the text of Aristotle when he writes: “The form of the proposition ‘A belongs to all B’ is in
mathematical logic (x) (Bx ⊃Ax). For Aristotle, the subject of this proposition is not the universal
class of individuals, but rather the class of individuals of which B holds, thus in short the class B.
And the predicate of the proposition is the predicate A. Aristotle’s conception thus differs from
the conception of mathematical logic in that in Aristotle the ‘universe of discourse’ is restricted to
the objects of which B holds. This restriction has the consequence that, though the Aristotelian
proposition is not true in any case in which the proposition in mathematical logic is false, in some
cases the proposition of Aristotle is neither true nor false, but rather meaningless while in the
interpretation of mathematical logic it is true: this occurs in all the cases in which an individual is
substituted for x which does not belong to the class B. The Aristotelian proposition says nothing at
all about this; yet the proposition in mathematical logic remains true in that case: it claims only
that the predicate A applies to x, if the predicate B applies to it.”

Scholium: Definition 2 determines the meaning of both the logical constant A
(. . ., . . .) as well as the logical constant O (. . ., . . .). This determination corresponds
to how Aristotle understands their meaning. He fixes the meaning of the constant
A (. . ., . . .) with the following words (see An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30 [1989, 2]): “We use
the expression ‘[α is] predicated of every [β]’, whenever none (μηδὲν)192 of the
things [e.g., γ] which fall under the subject-term [β] can be taken (λαβεῖν) of which
the other term [α] cannot be said. And we use ‘[α is] predicated of none [no β]’ like
wise [that is, no β can be taken of which α can be said].” As for the constant O (. . ., . . .),
Michael Wedin (1990, 134–35) has pointed out the interesting fact that Aristotle does not
choose ‘Some S is not P’ as the canonical form of the O proposition, but rather ‘Not every
S is P’, and that this choice apparently expresses the view that O propositions can be
true without ‘existential import’. That Aristotle has an additional motive for this choice
can be seen in the fact that he explicitly takes the form ‘Some S is not P’ as the form of a
(quantitively) indefinite (ἀδιόριστος) proposition (An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b 14–19), i.e., as the form
of a proposition which can be understood both as an O and as an E proposition (namely,
as a negated I proposition). In fact, Aristotle seems to use the form ‘Some S is not P’ as
the form of a (quantitatively definite) O proposition only in cases where, on the basis of
the context, the quantity of the proposition is not only determined, but it is also deter-
mined that S exists.193
3. A is a particular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form I (α, β) (in
words: some β is an α) if and only if, for every interpretation of α and β in which A
is a true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if some
concept (e.g., the concept of an α that is a β) – call it γ or δ or whatever – can be
formed for which it holds that: there is an object that falls under it, and it is the
case both that this object falls under the concepts α and β, as well as that every
In the MSS, the readings μηδὲν τoῦὑπoĸԑɩμένοʋ and μηδὲν τῶν τοῦὑποĸԑɩμένου have been
passed down. In his edition, Ross follows, against all MSS, Alexander of Aphrodisias, who brings to
the text an older manuscript which omits these genitives. They are to be understood as commentarial
additions to the original.
The view of Hermann Weidemann (see the remarks in his edition of Aristotle’s writing Peri Her-
meneias: Aristotle 2002, 208) that Aristotle supposes a statement of the form ‘not every S is P’ implies
a statement ‘some S is not P’, which is incompatible with the above observation, relies on a transla-
tion which seems to me to incompletely render and thus to distort the sense of An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b
15–16. That passage is not concerned with such an implication, but rather with the fact that if there is
a quantitatively indefinite negative premise (‘B does not belong to some C’), it is true in both mean-
ings (both in the particular as well as in the universal meaning), so that it is thus true “both if B
belongs to no C, as well as if it does not belong to every C,” and indeed “because B does not belong to
some C” (ὅτι τινὶοὐχ ὑπάϱχει). With Weidemann’s translation, which represents the ὅτι-clause as a
‘that’-clause, it becomes redundant, as he concedes. As a ‘that’-clause, it states what is already stated
in a previous part of the sentence, namely in the nominal expression ‘τὸ[. . .] ὑπάϱχειν’.

object which falls under this concept falls under the concepts α and β; (2) A is false
if and only if N A (= E (α, β)) is true and NN A is false (so that, if some object which
falls under the concept γ or δ or whatever other concept falls under one of the
concepts α and β, this object does not fall under the other of these concepts).
Corollary to definition 3: If a proposition of the form I (α, β) is true, then a con-
cept γ – for example, the concept of a β that is an α – can be formed194 such that the
following holds: some individual falls under the concept γ, and this individual with
predicate γ is a β, and there is no γ that does not fall under the concept α. If by
contrast a proposition of the form I (α, β) is false, this means, according to definition
3, that a proposition of the form N I (α, β) is true and that, if some individual which
falls under an arbitrary concept γ also falls under one of the two concepts α and β,
this individual γ then does not fall under the other of these two concepts.
Scholium: The last sentence of the corollary to definition 3 determines the mean-
ing of the logical constant E (. . ., . . .). This determination corresponds to the discus-
sion in which Aristotle explains this meaning. (See An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30.)
4. A is a singular affirmative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form Ạ(α, β) (in
words: that β is an α) if and only if, for any interpretation of α and β in which A is a
true or false proposition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if there is some
object β to which the predicate α belongs, and this object is the same as that object β
which is discussed in Ạ(α, β) and in the context of Ạ(α, β) (in case there is such a
context); (2) A is false if and only if N A (= Ẹ(α, β)) is true or β is an empty concept.
Scholium: Impredicative propositions like ‘It is raining’ are usually understood
as non-categorical propositions, but they can as a rule be understood as proposi-
tions which are singular categorical propositions in disguise. Thus, the proposition
‘It is raining’ is about the weather and states roughly: ‘This weather – the weather
being discussed or that is supposed to be discussed – is rainy weather.’
5. A is a limitative proposition, i.e., a proposition of the form Y (Nα, β), with Y = A,
Y = I, or Y = Ạ, (in words: every or some or that β is a not-α) if and only if, for any
interpretation of the concept variables α and β in which A is a true or false propo-
sition, the following holds: (1) A is true if and only if the predicate β is not an
empty concept and N Ζ (α, β), with Ζ = I, Ζ = A, or Ζ = Ạ, is a true proposition
whose quantity is the same as that of the proposition Y (Nα, β), and (2) A is false if
and only if N A is true or β is an empty concept.
For illustration by way of example, one can insert for α, β, and γ in sequence the concept
words ‘white’, ‘horse’, and ‘white horse [Schimmel]’.

§ 53 Basic Rules
The basic rules from which all the rules of the categorical syllogistic are derived, and
which are treated in these paragraphs, rest on the meanings of the logical constants
A ( ), I ( ), Ạ( ), and N( ), which are determined in the definitions established in § 52.
More precisely, rule (III. 1) corresponds to definition 2 (1). Rules (III. 2) and (III. 3) cor-
respond to the second and first sentences, respectively, in the corollary to definition
3. Rule (III. 4) corresponds to the corollary to definition 2. Rule (III. 5) corresponds to
definition 1 (2), rule (III. 6) to definition 3 (2). The validity of (III. 7) arises from defini-
tion 4, while the validity of rules (III. 8) to (III. 10) results from definition 5.
If α, β, and γ are concept variables, then rules (III. 1) and (III. 2) are valid
(cf. Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30):
Dictum de omni:
A (α, β) : : I (β, β), H (I (β, γ), Ạ(α, γ))
(III. 1)
Dictum de nullo:
N I (α, β) : : H (I (β, γ), N Ạ(α, γ))
(III. 2)
Rules (III. 1) and (III. 2) also remain valid if the concept variable γ is replaced in
all places of its occurrence in the formulas which render these rules.
Let γ be a variable which occurs in no premise formula of the lines of a proof
which proceed the line in which one of the two following formulas (III. 3) and (III. 4)
stands. Then and only then does this formula express a valid rule:
First exposition rule:
I (α, β) ∴A (α, γ), Ạ(β, γ)
(III. 3)
Second exposition rule:
N A (α, β) ∴N I (α, γ), H (I (β, β), Ạ(β, γ))
(III. 4)
Scholium: Similarities may be noticed between the way Aristotle describes the opera-
tion he designate as ἔκϑεσις (“exposition”) and the way he expresses, in An. pr. 1. 1,
24 b 28–30 (1989, 2), what the logical constants ‘predicated of every’ and ‘predicated
of none’ mean. Namely, to explain this meaning he uses the same Greek word for
“can be taken” (λαβεῖν) that he also uses for the expository procedure. He writes in
An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 28–30: “We use the expression ‘[α is] predicated of every [β]’, when-
ever none of the things [e.g., γ] which fall under the subject-term [β] (μηδὲν τῶν τoῦ
ὑπoĸԑιμένoʋ)195 can be taken (λαβεῖν) of which the other term [α] cannot be said.
And we use ‘[α is] predicated of none [no β]’ likewise [that is, when no γ can be
Compare note 192.

Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

taken of which α can be said].” What is meant here should be more clear from An.
pr. 1. 41. There (49 b 14–32 [1989, 57]), he says something more about the meaning of
‘α is predicated of all β’. He says that ‘A (α, β)’ means: “α belongs to everything to
which all β belongs.”196 This statement can be paraphrased in the following way: if
one only finds some example of those objects to which the predicate β belongs, and
designate it, e.g., as γ (so that I (β, γ) holds), then on the assumption that A (α, β) is
the case it also immediately holds that this γ is an α. That is, ‘A (α, β)’ means that no
concept, e.g., no concept γ, can be formed for which it would not at once also hold
that if some γ is a β, then this γ is an α; symbolically expressed: A (α, β) ∴H (I (β, γ),
Ạ(α, γ)). This corresponds to the dictum de omni in its above formulation (III. 1).
Contradiction rules of the logical square:
NN A (α, β) ∴A (α, β)
(III. 5)
NN I (α, β) ∴I (α, β)
(III. 6)
I call rules (III. 5) and (III. 6) contradiction rules, since they are equivalent to rules which,
together with certain other rules, express that two propositions of the form N A (α, β)
and A (α, β) or two propositions of the form N I (α, β) and I (α, β) are contradictory to
each other, respectively. These other rules do not need to be introduced explicitly
as basic rules, since their validity results from the validity of the more general
basic rules. These rules are the converse counterparts to (III. 5) and (III. 6), namely,
(1) A (α, β) ∴NN A (α, β) and
(2) I (α, β) ∴NN I (α, β),
thus cases of the direct application of rule (I. 1), from which – on the basis of (I. 4) –
in conjunction with (III. 5) or (III. 6) the rules A (α, β) ∴A (α, β) and I (α, β) ∴I (α,
β), respectively, are immediately derivable. From which in turn result – on the
basis of (I. 2) – the two following rules:
(3) N A (α, β) ∴N A (α, β) and
(4) N I (α, β) ∴N I (α, β).
If one takes ‘E (α, β)’ and ‘O (α, β)’ as abbreviations for ‘N I (α, β)’ and ‘N A (α, β)’, respec-
tively, then (3) and (4) can be understood as expressions that summarize the four contra-
diction rules of the logical square; to them the following formulas correspond:
N A (α, β) : : O (α, β) and
N I (α, β) : : E (α, β).
As according to Günther Patzig’s (1963, 43, n. 1) translation of this passage in the second edi-
tion of his book Die aristotelische Syllogistik.
2 Principles § 53
183

The remaining contradiction rules of the logical square, i.e.,
N O (α, β) : : A (α, β) and
N E (α, β) : : I (α, β),
are only transformations of rules (III. 5) and (III. 6), respectively, or the inverse
counterparts of (1) and (2).
Subalternation in the weak logical square:
Ạ(α, β) ∴I (α, β)
(III. 7)
As for the remaining rules of the logical square, they can all be taken as derived
rules of the categorical syllogistic (see § 54 below).
Basic rules of the limitative proposition:
A (Nα, β) ∴N I (α, β)
(III. 8)
I (Nα, β) ∴N A (α, β)
(III. 9)
Ạ(Nα, β) ∴N Ạ(α, β)
(III. 10)
According to these rules, a negative proposition follows logically from a limitative
proposition of the same quantity if the subject concepts of both propositions con-
cur and the predicate concept of the limitative proposition is the antonym of the
predicate concept of the negative proposition (see also Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 46, 51 b
41–52 a 5). Incidentally, the validity of an inference does not change at all when a
positive concept expression is replaced in all places of its occurrence with a nega-
tive concept expression of the form Nα.
3 Derived Rules
§ 54 Rules of the Strong and Weak Logical Squares
With the division of the rules of the logical square which Aristotle treats in De
interpretatione 7 and An. pr. 2. 15 into basic rules ((III. 5) to (III. 7)) and derived
rules ((III. 11) to (III. 16)), I do not claim to be presenting an Aristotelian division.
Yet it can be supposed that Aristotle was familiar with the six rules which I will use
here to derive rules (III. 11) to (III. 16). These are the rules (I. 1), (I. 2), (I. 4), (I. 5), (II. 2),
and (II. 6). As for rule (I. 1), it is in substance simply a summary of rules of the logical
square. Concerning Aristotle’s acquaintance with the rule of modus ponendo ponens
184
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

(II. 2), I refer the reader to my remark on this rule in § 48.197 Concerning his
acquaintance with the four metalogical rules (I. 2), (I. 4), (I. 5), and (II. 6), though
the observance of the syllogistic method of proof, and with this the general use
of the metalogical rules in the school of Aristotle, is well-documented (see § 41
above), there is a lack of investigation into the manner and extent to which Aris-
totle’s Prior Analytics show clear traces of the application of these rules. This is
especially true of the application of rules (I. 4) and (I. 5), which follow from the
synthetic theorem, i.e., the Peripatetic inference chain rule (I. 3), as well as the
idempotency rule (II. 6). Rule (I. 2) is used explicitly by Aristotle under the name
of ἀπαγωγὴεἰς τὸἀδύνατον.

Ạ(α, β)’ can be abbreviated by ‘Ẹ(α, β)’ and ‘N A (α, β)’ by ‘O (α, β)’, rule (III. 12)
expresses that a proposition of the form O (α, β) is related as subaltern to a propo-
sition of the form Ẹ(α, β).
Although Theodor Ebert believes that modus ponendo ponens is for Aristotle “not a valid syl-
logistic mode” (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 329), he also supposes that Aristotle makes use of this
inference form in his syllogistic. He attributes the fact that Aristotle does not explicitly draw at-
tention to this use to the “self-evident character of this form of consequence” (Ebert & Nortmann
2007, 329).

Contrariety:
The fact that there is a contrary relation between Ạ(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β), so that
two propositions of these forms can both be false but not both true, is the direct
result of the fact that, as per rule (I. 1), NN Ạ(α, β) follows logically from Ạ(α, β)
and that, as per § 53, def. 4 (2), Ạ(α, β) is false when N Ạ(α, β) is true, but both Ạ
(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β) are false in case β is an empty concept.

In (III. 14) are compressed three further rules of the logical square, which can be
immediately distinguished from each other if we replace ‘N I (α, β)’ with ‘E (α, β)’
and ‘N A (α, β)’ with ‘O (α, β)’. These rules are:
E (α, β) ∴O (α, β),
N I (α, β) ∴O (α, β), and
E (α, β) ∴N A (α, β).
The first of these three rules is another subalternation rule. The second along
with (III. 15) indicates the subcontrariety between I (α, β) and O (α, β), the third
along with (III. 16) indicates the contrariety between E (α, β) and A (α, β).

Scholium: The rule indicating the contrariety of Ạ(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β), namely:
Ạ(α, β) ∴NN Ạ(α, β),
does not need a derivation, since it depends on the immediate application of (I. 1).
The fact that the relationship between Ạ(α, β) and N Ạ(α, β) is not contradictory
is a result of the invalidity of the rule NN Ạ(α, β) ∴Ạ(α, β).

The rule derived in line [10] is different from modus Darapti (III. 30) in that it
does not bring only universal premises into play. The validity of (III. 17) thus does
not presuppose, as is sometimes supposed, the validity of Darapti.
Theodor Ebert, in his reconstruction of the Aristotelian proof of the validity of
I-conversion, assumes the convertibility of E propositions. In his reconstruction of the
(indirect) proof of the convertibility of E propositions, however, he carries out an
I-conversion on the basis of the supposition that I propositions have the form
(∃x) (A x & B x) and, because of the commutativity of the &-relation, are convert-
ible (see Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 235–38). According to this reconstruction, Aristotle
avoids a circle in the validity proof of E-conversion only because he (unlike how it
appears in his text) carries out two different proofs for the validity of I-conversion
and further helps himself to a theory (namely, modern quantification theory)
which he could not have known. The indirect proof for the validity of I-conversion
appears, according to this reconstruction, as an unnecessary detour.

Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

Scholium: The three conversion rules were proven by Aristotle in the same order
as above and in the same way, namely, indirectly.198
Since universally negative propositions are convertible, it can be proven simply
through subalternation that the rule N I (α, β) ∴N A (β, α) is valid as well. But this of
course does not allow us to say that also particular negative propositions are also
convertible. Rather, only E, I and A propositions are convertible, and the latter only
per accidens. This may be the simple reason why Aristotle only considers three rules
as conversion rules. Ebert, by contrast, sees the reason for this in the fact that Aris-
totle did not need “the convertibility of BeA to AoB” for the validity proofs of valid
modes in the second and third figures (Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 238–39). It would be
more appropriate to say: Aristotle did not need the simple conversion of negative
universal propositions (with a subsequent subalternation) for these validity proofs.
§ 56 Categorical Syllogisms
1. Perfect syllogisms
The label ‘perfect syllogisms’ corresponds to a classification of inference rules
which goes back to Aristotle.199 Among modern interpreters, the reigning opinion
is that the perfection of syllogisms consists for Aristotle in their ‘self-evidence’,
and this self-evidence makes a derivation from more basic principles (like the dic-
tum de omni (III. 1) and the dictum de nullo (III. 2)) neither necessary nor possible.
For Robin Smith Aristotle’s distinction between perfect and imperfect syllogisms
concerns nothing but “the difference between a valid and an evidently valid argu-
ment” (Aristotle 1989, 110). Günther Patzig (1969, 51–93) has also attempted to offer
justification for this interpretation. He summarizes what a perfect syllogism is for
Aristotle with the following words:
[A] perfect inference is an inference in which the defined necessity is not only present but
rather ‘appears’ or becomes clear, while an imperfect inference may have this necessity as
well but still requires certain operations in order to make this necessity ‘appear’ or become
clear. In a word: perfect inferences are self-evident inferences. Accordingly, Aristotle also
calls ‘perfect’ syllogisms ‘apparent’ inferences. (Patzig 1969, 54)
Yet this opinion cannot be supported by Aristotle’s texts. According to the relevant
definition of the perfect syllogism in 1. 1, 24 b 22–26, perfect syllogisms are not
For the reconstruction of the proof, see M. Wolff 1998, 131–70.
Even though Aristotle often renders syllogisms with ‘if-then’-propositions, the view that for
Aristotle syllogisms are not propositions but rules can be defended on good grounds, though it is
disputed by Łukasiewicz and others. On this see, Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 220–25.

distinguished from imperfect syllogisms by their self-evidence, nor by a higher de-
gree of self-evidence, but rather only in that “in order to be evident” (πρὸς τὸϕανῆ-
ναι) they “require nothing else beyond what already has been supposed [with their
premises]” (παρὰτὰԑἰλημμένα).200 In other words: a syllogism is perfect when its
validity (i.e., when the necessity with which its conclusion follows from its prem-
ises) can be made clear without (as is necessary with imperfect syllogisms) taking
into consideration more than what is present with the premises which are assumed
to be true and their meaning.
This explanation of the perfect syllogism of course does not only exclude but
precisely assumes that the validity even of perfect syllogisms can be proved on the
basis of deeper principles. But such proof of validity must be distinguished essentially
from that of an imperfect syllogism. Imperfect syllogisms are proved by Aristotle
with reductio ad impossibile (according to rule (I. 2)), with exposition (according to
rule (III. 3) or (III. 4)) or with conversion (according to one of rules (III. 17) to (III. 19)).
All these proofs rely on using a supposition which does not belong among the prem-
ises of the syllogism that is to be proved. For: in order to carry out a proof with re-
ductio ad impossibile, one must bring into play a supposition which does not belong
to the syllogism to be proved; rather, it is the contradictory of the conclusion of the
syllogism to be proved, from which, in conjunction with one of its premises, the pre-
cise contradictory of the other premise follows. Exposition proofs as well can only be
carried out with the introduction of an additional supposition, for the application of
one of the exposition rules (III. 3) and (III. 4) is tied to the introduction of a concept
variable which does not occur anywhere among the variables of the inference rule
to be proved itself. Finally, conversions also rely on the introduction of an additional
supposition. As the above proofs for the validity of the conversion rules (III. 17) to
(III. 19) show, any application of one of these rules consists in the abbreviation of a
procedure in which, through exposition, an additional concept variable which does
not already occur in the formula to be converted is introduced, and then a reductio
ad impossibile still comes into play. By contrast, the validity proofs for perfect syllo-
gisms are carried out directly and exclusively from the premises that occur in them.
Namely, in order to see the validity of a perfect syllogism, it suffices to pay attention
to the meanings (as fixed by their definitions) of the logical constants which occur in
the premises of the syllogism. That is, it suffices here to make use of dictum de omni
et nullo, namely of basic rules (III. 1) and (III. 2), which in accordance with definitions
Aristotle, An. pr. 1. 1, 24 b 22–26 (1984, 40): “I call perfect a deduction which needs nothing
other than what has been stated to make the necessity evident (πρὸς τὸϕανῆναɩ τὸἀναγκαῖον);
a deduction is imperfect if it needs [in addition] either one or more things [suppositions], which
are indeed the necessary consequences of the terms set down, but have not been [explicitly] as-
sumed in the propositions.”
190
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

2 and 3 in § 52 (or in accordance with the definitions which Aristotle introduced in
connection with his explanation of the perfect syllogism at the end of chapter 1 of
the first book of Analytica priora (24 b 28–30)) make explicit what it means for pre-
mises of the form A (α, β) or N I (α, β) to be true.
The distinction between perfect and imperfect syllogisms thus depends on an
underlying structural distinction in the validity proofs of perfect and imperfect
syllogisms. One can only see this structural distinction if one grasps what conver-
sion proofs depend on for Aristotle. If one believes with Ebert and other Aristotle
interpreters that I-conversion can only be explained on the basis of a modern
quantification theory (see my comment above to (III. 18)), one is blocked from un-
derstanding the distinction Aristotle describes between the perfection and imper-
fection of syllogisms.
Ebert supposes with Günther Patzig that perfect syllogisms distinguish them-
selves as self-evidently valid modes of inference through the “formulation of their
premises” and “the position of the middle term between the two extremes.”201 Yet
Aristotle nowhere explains the perfection of syllogisms through peculiarities of their
inner structure. Rather, he traces their perfection quite expressly back to the way
their validity is proved. Thus he says that syllogisms are perfect because they are “at
once” (εὐϑύς (An. pr. 1. 16, 36 a 6–7 [1989, 26])) “brought to completion [. . .] by means
of the initial premises” (An. pr. 1. 4, 26 b. 30)). In other places, he says of perfect syllo-
gisms that their validity is “evident from the definition” (ϕανερὸν ἐκ τοῦὁρισμοῦ
(14, 32 b 40 and 14, 33 a 24–25 [1989, 19–20])), namely from the definition of the logical
constants that occur in the premises; and he designates the derivation of their valid-
ity “from the definition” explicitly as “proof” (ἀπόδειξις (14, 33 a 27 and 15, 35 a 35)).
By contrast, he says of an imperfect syllogism “that it is imperfect is clear from the
proof” (16, 36 a 1). Syllogisms are imperfect because “the necessary result is brought
to completion not from the initial premises alone, but from others in addition” (1. 5,
27 a 16–17 [1989, 7]; cf. 28 a 5–7).
For this reason, treating perfect syllogisms as modes of inference whose valid-
ity requires no proof, as is typical in the recent Aristotle literature, does not con-
form to the views of Aristotle.

This derivation of Barbara from basic rule (III. 1) corresponds to the justification
which Aristotle indicates in An. pr. 1. 4, 25 b 37–40 for his supposition of the validity
of Barbara: this supposition relies on the meaning of the expression (i.e., the logical
constant) ‘. . . is said of every . . . ’. He gives an analogous justification in 25 b 40–26 a

From Barbara and Celarent, syllogisms of the modes Barbari and Celaront can be
derived by weakening the respective conclusion according to subalternation rules
(III. 13) and (III. 14). The same holds for all syllogisms with universal conclusions
that are derived in what follows.
Although the following two modes (III. 22) and (III. 23), i.e., Darii and Ferio, can
be derived from modes of the second figure, namely from Camestres (III. 25) and
Cesare (III. 24) respectively (see (III. 28) and (III. 29)), they can also count as perfect
syllogisms, since like Barbara and Celarent they can be derived directly from basic

rules (III. 1) and (III. 2), respectively (cf. An. pr. 1. 4, 26 a 17–23). This happens in the

(I. ) [, ]
Unlike the conclusion of Ferio, the conclusions of Barbara, Celarent, and Darii can
each be converted according to one of the rules (III. 17) to (III. 19). This is something
that Aristotle points out in An. pr. 3. 1, 53 a 3–14. Each of the modes of the tradition-
ally titled ‘fourth figure’, namely, Bamalip, Calemes, and Dimatis in turn, result from
these conversions. Modes of the fourth figure in which the conclusion is a particular
negative proposition, namely, Fesapo and Fresison, can be derived directly through
the conversion of the universal negative premise of a mode of the third figure.202
(See my remarks to (III. 31) and (III. 35) below.)
2. Imperfect syllogisms
Imperfect syllogisms are reduced in the Aristotelian syllogism to perfect syllo-
gisms through one of the three following operations: (1) by conversion (as per
(III. 17), (III. 18), or (III. 19)), with transposition of the terms that occur in them, (2)
by exposition (as per (III. 3), or (III. 4)), or (3) by indirect proof (that is, through
reductio ad absurdum as per (I. 2)).
(1) Conversion proofs all rely on rules whose validity depends on the validity
of exposition rule (III. 3) (see the proof of (III. 18)). Proofs by conversion – including
those by conversio per accidens – are to that extent indirectly proofs by exposition.
It is not the case, as Theodor Ebert believes, that through the premise conversion that Aristo-
tle describes in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27, “new” syllogisms “never” result from modes of the second
and third figure, but rather always only syllogisms already proven from the second and third
figure. See his commentary on An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27 in Ebert & Nortmann 2007, 347.
3 Derived Rules § 56
193

(2) Proofs by exposition, as the rules (III. 3) and (III. 4) show, rely essentially on the
introduction of a term which does not occur at all in the premises of the syllogism
whose validity is to be proved by exposition. (3) The third kind of proof, reductio ad
absurdum, belongs to the type of indirect proofs; these can only be carried out by
introducing an additional premise in the argumentation, namely, the negation of the
conclusion. – Since no other than these three kinds of proof must be brought into
play, it is entirely appropriate and understandable when Aristotle defines syllogisms
called ‘imperfect’ as deductions which are distinguished from perfect syllogisms not,
say, by a lack of self-evidence, but rather because in order to be self-evident this kind
of syllogism “needs [in addition] either one or more things [suppositions], which are
indeed the necessary consequences of the terms set down, but have not been [explic-
itly] assumed in the propositions” (I. 1, 24 b. 24–26 [1984, 40]).

The fact already remarked by Aristotle (An. pr. 1. 7, 29 b 6–15) that Darii and Ferio
can both be derived from modes of the second figure, namely from Camestres
and Cesare respectively, whose validity in each case depends on the validity of

Celarent, shows that imperfect syllogisms which are reducible to Darii or Ferio
are further reducible to Celarent.

Darapti:

Darapti can be derived not only, as here, by conversion from Darii, but also by
reductio ad impossibile from Celarent, namely thus:

For the three kinds of proof that Aristotle mentions for the validity of Darapti, see
An. pr. 1. 6, a 28–25. But he sketches there only the proofs by conversion and expo-
sition. That there is a proof by reductio ad impossibile he only claims.
Scholium: Since these proofs are valid, the criticism put forth by Hilbert and
Ackermann on the syllogistic treatment of Darapti (see § 17 above) comes to
nought. The evidence offered by Bertrand Russell in his essay “The Philosophy of
Logical Atomism” is unable to support the (certainly correct) claim in the last sen-
tence of the following quotation, when he writes:
196
Part II Section Three Categorical Syllogistic

I want to say emphatically that general propositions are to be interpreted as not
involving existence. [. . .] This notion, of course, of general propositions not involving
existence is one which is not in the traditional doctrine of the syllogism. In the tradi-
tional doctrine of the syllogism it was assumed that when you have such a statement
as “All Greeks are men,” that implies that there are Greeks, and this produced falla-
cies. For instance, “All chimeras are animals, and all chimeras breath flame, there-
fore some animals breathe flame.” This is a syllogism in Darapti, but that mood of
the syllogism is fallacious, as this instance shows. That was a point, by the way,
which had a certain historical interest, because it impeded Leibniz in his attempts to
construct a mathematical logic. He [. . .] was always failing because of his respect for
Aristotle. Whenever he invented a really good system, as he did several times, it al-
ways brought out that such moods as Darapti are fallacious. If you say “All A is B and
all A is C, therefore some B is C” – if you say this you incur a fallacy, but he could not
bring himself to believe that it was fallacious, so he began again. That shows you
should not have too much respect for distinguished men. (Russell, 1919a, 190–91, my
emphasis)

Aristotle mentions this proof by conversion in An. pr. 1. 6, 28 a 26–30; he mentions
in addition a proof per impossibile, which could proceed as follows:

The first two lines already present an indirect proof for Bocardo (III. 34), which is
described by Aristotle as a proof per impossibile in An. pr. 1. 6, 28 b 17–20. Disamis
and Datisi can be proved in a similar way. In these cases, however, Celarent (III. 21)
rather than Barbara (III. 20) is the point of departure. Aristotle points out in An. pr.
1. 6, 28 b 7–25 that Disamis and Datisi are to be proved by conversion or ekthesis as
well. This can be done as follows.
By conversion of the first premise according to rule (III. 17) a mode of the so-
called fourth figure (traditionally called Fesapo) can be derived from Felapton,
which Aristotle points out in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27.

As lines [1] and [2] show, this proof depends on exposition. Aristotle claims that
such a proof for Bocardo is possible in An. pr. 1. 6, 28 b 17–21. However, he does not
give a more precise description of this proof. Instead, he only sketches there the
proof per impossibile, which was already contained in the indirect proof for Felap-
ton. (See my remarks to (III. 31) above.)

This proof by conversion corresponds to the proof sketched by Aristotle in An.
pr. 1. 6, 28 b 33–35.
By conversion of the first premise, according to rule (III. 17), a mode of the so-
called fourth figure, traditionally called Fresison, can be derived from Ferison, as
Aristotle indicates in An. pr. 1. 7, 29 a 21–27.
However, Aristotle speaks neither of a fourth figure nor of modes, since the
order of premises is irrelevant for his system.

3. Singular syllogisms:
Syllogisms of the first and second figure with two universal premises remain
valid when the minor premise and the conclusion are replaced by singular ex-
pressions. Syllogisms of the third figure with two universal premises remain
valid when they are replaced by singular premises.

In Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Pyrrhonism II, 163–66 [2000, 11–12]) a syllogism is
discussed as an example of the “categorical syllogisms” which “were especially
used by the Peripatetics,” which corresponds to rule (III. 36):
“Socrates is a human being;
All human beings are animals;
So Socrates is an animal.”
Syllogisms of this type, which Aristotle did not yet explicitly address, were treated
in more detail by medieval logicians, e.g., by William of Ockham. He discusses the
syllogism mentioned by Sextus in Summa Logicae (1957, III 1. 20; 41 rb).

§ 57 Universally Valid Propositional Schemata
Through conditionalization, according to (II. 28), all universally valid rules of cat-
egorical inference can be transformed into universally valid propositional sche-
mata. Thus, e.g., from (III. 18) the schema
✶∴H (I (α, β), I (β, α))
(III. 42)
or from (III. 20) the schema
✶∴H (A (α, β), H (A (β, γ), A (α, γ)))
(III. 43)
can be derived. I will spare myself the simple proofs for the universal validity of
these two propositional schemata.
By contrast, formulas like
✶∴I (β, β), ✶∴Ạ(β, β) or ✶∴A (β, β)
3 Derived Rules § 57
201

are neither derivable from the principles established above, nor do such formulas
for their part express principles which would have to be assumed as valid within
the categorical syllogistic. At best, formulas are derivable in which a tautological
expression occurs as a sub-formula, for example:
✶∴H (I (α, β), A (β, β)).
(III. 44)
This formula is derivable, because the following rule is derivable.
I (α, β) ∴A (β, β)
(III. 45)
Proof:
[]
N A (β, β) ∴N I (β, α)

(III. )
[]
I (α, β) ∴A (β, β)
(I. ) [, , ]
On the basis of (III. 45) the following formulas are derivable as well, as can be
easily understood:
✶∴H (Ạ(α, β), A (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (A (α, β), A (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (I (α, β), I (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (Ạ(α, β), I (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (A (α, β), I (β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (A (α, β), Ạ(β, β)),
(III. )
✶∴H (I (α, β), Ạ(β, β)) and
(III. )
✶∴H (Ạ(α, β), Ạ(β, β)).
(III. )
The fact that tautological propositions of the categorical form A (α, α), I (α, α) or Ạ
(α, α) do not need to be assumed as true within the elementary syllogistic is to be
construed as the expression of a deeper-seated logical sitation. Namely, the truth of
an affirmative categorical proposition depends on whether the concepts to which its
terms relate are satisfied or empty (see § 53, scholium to def. 1). Thus, for any inter-
pretation one gives to expressions of the form A (α, α), I (α, α) or Ạ(α, α), it depends
on the content of the concept for which the concept variable α stands whether it is a
true or false. A proposition of the form A (α, α) can accordingly be false, if the con-
cept α is empty. If one supposes that a proposition of this form is analytic, there
are – against a widespread conviction – analytic propositions which are false.
