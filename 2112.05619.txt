Abstract
This work is to consolidate current literature on Koopman-von Neumann
(KvN) Mechanics into a simple and easy to understand text. KvN Mechanics is
a branch of Classical Mechanics that has been recast into the mathematical lan-
guage of Quantum Mechanics. KvN Mechanics utilizes a Hilbert phase space
with operators to calculate the expectation values of observables of interest (ex-
pectation values such as position, momentum, etc.) It is an important tool in
statistical physics and guide to illuminate the mysterious relationship between
Quantum and Classical Physics. A lot of important applications of KvN Me-
chanics have been developed in the last decades.

Acknowledgements
Thanksgiving is approaching at the time I’m writing this, so there are some people
who will get some messages of gratitude from me a few days early.
First, I would like to thank the Tulane Summer Research Program and the Tulane
Honors Program. This project would not have been possible without their support.
Many thanks to the readers of this thesis: Dr. Ryan Glasser, Dr. Frank Tipler, and
especially my advisor for this project, Dr. Denys Bondar. I am grateful for his advice
on this paper and guidance for how I can take what I’ve learned from it and apply
it to the rest of my career, both in terms of new knowledge about the subject matter
and skills I’ve been practicing while working on this. His openness and directness
in advising me made a big diﬀerence, and I’ve learned a lot from working on this
project. Also, 80 pages is a lot to read, so I am grateful for the time all three of these
professors have dedicated to reading my work.
******************************************************************
I am also very appreciative to my friends and family for their encouragement,
prayers, and patience with me. This thesis was a huge commitment for me, and they
were respectful of my time when I was busy and curious and uplifting during my few
moments of downtime. One of them also helped look over some of it and did some
proofreading, which I also am thankful for. Thanks goes especially to my sweetheart
Clover Robichaud for her continual advice, patience, and support while the project
has been ongoing. Also, thanks goes to my good friend Kushal Singh for helping me
prepare for the Thesis Defense itself.
Finally, I am grateful to all other physicists and aspiring physicists who read this;
if you are one of these people, you are exploring a little known topic that can make
a big diﬀerence, and I appreciate that you are likely branching out from the standard
iii

topics you are already taught in class. I am hopeful that my work contributed to
their knowledge of Koopman–von Neumann Mechanics and that this will help them
expand the ﬁeld of Physics. This is currently a little known branch of Physics, and the
goal of this project was to make this information more accessible to others unfamiliar
with the topic, both in Physics and otherwise. If anyone could take what I did and
have that help him or her in contributing to Physics, then I will know that I have made
a diﬀerence.

Introduction
Quantum Mechanics (QM) is known for its unique mathematical structure unlike that
traditionally found in other branches of Physics. In QM, one has operators acting on
the wavefunction in complex Hilbert Space in order to compute what the expectation
values of observables seen in the laboratory are (Shankar 1988). Classical Mechanics
(CM), on the other hand, is based on continuous, real valued functions of spatial and
time dependent variables. One merely has to plug in the values of the variables at
a particular point, and one knows the value of the function of interest. QM makes
probabilistic predictions of the quantum particle in question, whereas CM makes
deterministic predictions of all classical behavior.
The large diﬀerences in mathematical form has historically made it diﬃcult to
compare QM to CM (Mauro 2003). There have been many attempts to make QM
appear more mathematically similar to CM (Mauro 2003). For instance, the Born
and Madelung approach to QM has a modiﬁed Hamilton-Jacobi equation as its basis
(Mauro 2003). But there have been few attempts to make CM more similar in form
to QM. This changed in the 1930’s, however, when a form of statistical CM was
devised by Bernard Koopman and John von Neumann that had the same operatorial
mathematical structure as QM (Koopman 1931; von Neumann 1932). Koopman-von
Neumann Mechanics (KvNM), as it later became known, was subsequently used by
mathematicians to formulate ergodic theory, while physicists mostly forgot about the
existence of this ﬁeld. Currently, there is a large renewal of interest by the physics
community in this relatively obscure ﬁeld of study.
In this Thesis I intend to articulate many signiﬁcant contributions of KvNM to
physics in a straightforward and easy to understand fashion. I am writing this text
in such a way that even an undergraduate with limited training in Physics could un-
derstand. I will point out signiﬁcant topics of research in KvNM and how they are
changing physics as we know it. By making this topic more accessible to a variety of
readers, I hope that many will ﬁnd it of interest and continue to build upon this novel
and fascinating avenue of study.

KvNM is statistical CM cast in the language of complex wavefunctions in Hilbert
Space. Although wavefunctions in Hilbert Space are thought to be tools of QM, they
can be used to exactly model the statistical properties of purely classical systems.
Classical wavefunctions have been used to study a wide range of physical phenom-
ena. For example, they have been used in studying chaotic systems in quantum and
classical theory (Wilkie and Brumer 1997), been used to develop a model of stochas-
ticity from determinism (McCaul and Bondar 2021), been used to study the inter-
play of connected quantum and classical systems (Bondar, Gay-Balmaz, and Tronci
2019), been used to study free fall and Fischer Information (Sen, Dhasmana, and
Silagadze 2020), been used to reproduce equations governing spin 1/2 relativistic
particles (Cabrera et al. 2019), among many other areas of research.
Of great interest, a ﬁeld like KvNM might be able to decipher the true meaning
of QM, which has been hotly debated for over a century.1

General Review of Quantum Mechanics
What follows is a brief review of Quantum Theory. QM depends on operations on
the vector |ψ⟩in Hilbert Space. The wavefunction |ψ⟩is a complete description of
the state of the system in QM (Shankar 1988). It contains probabilistic information
of the system’s behavior.
It has a number of convenient properties, such as the fact that it makes switching
between one set of bases and another is a rather straightforward task. Hilbert Space
useful for all sorts of mathematical procedures. It is, however, not the typical tool of
CM.
1Despite a century of progress, QM has no consensus interpretation of its equations.
‘Shut up and calculate’ rings as true today as it did a century ago. Feynman gives us a glimmer of
hope for the situation, however, as it always takes several generations to understand a great, mysterious
truth: “We have always had a great deal of diﬃculty understanding the world view that quantum
mechanics represents. At least I do, because I’m an old enough man that I haven’t got to the point that
this stuﬀis obvious to me... You know how it always is, every new idea, it takes a generation or two
until it becomes obvious that there’s no real problem.” (Feynman 1982) Perhaps we’re getting closer
to an understanding and perhaps a budding ﬁeld like KvNM can hold clues to the answer.

2.1
Fundamentals of Hilbert Space
To understand QM, we must ﬁrst be comfortable with the concept of a Hilbert Space.
A Hilbert Space is an inﬁnite dimensional vector space with a well deﬁned inner
product. One can conceive of the Hilbert Space as a coordinate system with an inﬁnite
number of perpendicular axes as a crude model. For QM, the Hilbert Space we use
not only contains real numbers, but has also been extended to the complex numbers.
Although there are Hilbert Spaces that only contain real numbers, we will not need
to concern ourselves with those when working with QM or KvNM.
To see why Hilbert Spaces are so useful in QM, imagine a generic function f(x)
which is continuous on its domain (Shankar 1988). Since any continuous function
can be represented by an inﬁnite number of points, we can represent any continuous
function in Hilbert Space with state vectors. Each point along a generic function
f(x) can be represented by a vector in Hilbert Space. Because there is an inﬁnite
number of points along the function f(x) (even in a ﬁnite segment), we should not
be surprised it will take an inﬁnite number of vectors to represent f(x).
This collection of vectors can be represented in an orthogonal basis (i.e., each
vector is perpendicular to any other vector in the collection or set, as there are an
inﬁnite number of perpendicular axes in Hilbert Space.) A vector can be represented
with the following bra-ket notation (original to Dirac):
⃗v =






v1
v2
v3






=⇒|v⟩=









, ⟨v| =

v∗
1
v∗

v∗
3.

where |v⟩is the ket vector and ⟨v| is the bra vector (Shankar 1988). The asterisk
(*) represents the complex conjugate. Vectors like ⃗v are ambiguous, because it is
not often clear if to write them as columns (as depicted above) or rows of numbers.
However, the Dirac bra-ket notation overcomes the ambiguity of typical vector nota-
tion in physics, by having that the ket is always equivalent to a column and the bra is
equivalent to a row of values. Hilbert Space utilizes bra-ket notation in its inﬁnite di-
3

mensional mathematics. A traditional Hilbert Space ket might have more than three
entries therefore; it might be represented with an inﬁnite number of entries.
With this in mind, the continuous function f(x) would be represented in Hilbert
Space as:
f(x) =⇒|f(x)⟩=




You can think about this representation of f(x) as the value of each point along f(x),
i.e. f(xi), having a unique independent basis vector in Hilbert Space multiplying it.
So according to the rules of Linear Algebra you may expand |f(x)⟩, for example:
|f(x)⟩=

In the above expansion, notice that the column vectors form a unique set of linearly
independent basis vectors.
The way to switch between bras and kets in a complex Hilbert Space is to take
the transpose of the vector and complex conjugate of each of the values, like so:

where ⟨w|v⟩is a generalized “dot product” or inner product for the vector space. Two
vectors are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is 0. So in order for two vectors
|v⟩and |w⟩in Hilbert Space to be orthogonal, we must have ⟨w|v⟩= 0. Also, like
for any common vector, you can rescale a vector by a complex constant c to stretch
or shrink its magnitude: |v′⟩= c |v⟩.
The vectors additionally obey the following properties:
(⟨w|v⟩)† = ⟨v|w⟩,
|c1v + c2w⟩† = (c1 |v⟩+ c2 |w⟩)† = (c1 |v⟩)† + (c2 |w⟩)† = c∗

Since continuous functions like f(x) can be represented in Hilbert Space, we can
recast continuous functions of QM into the Hilbert Space formalism. We will shortly
see why this is useful to do.
The wavefunction ψ is the backbone of the quantum mechanical description of
reality. The wavefunction ψ is an equation of state, i.e., it provides us with a descrip-
tion of the state of the system (Shankar 1988). 2The wavefunction got its name from
the fact that its form resembles that of a wave equation. In conﬁguration space, the
wavefunction is often written as:
ψ(q1, q2, ..., qn, t) = R(q1, q2, ..., qn, t)eiS(q1,q2,...,qn,t)/ℏ,
(3)
where q1, q2, ..., qn are positions in conﬁguration space and t is time. S represents the
Action and R is the amplitude of the wave equation. In light of the above discussion
and since ψ is a continuous function, we can represent ψ as |ψ(t)⟩in complex Hilbert
Space. Schr¨odinger’s equation, for example, becomes:
iℏ∂ψ
∂t = −ℏ2
2m
∂2ψ
∂q2 + V (q)ψ =⇒iℏ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂q2 |ψ(t)⟩+ V (q) |ψ(t)⟩.
(4)
The beneﬁts of using Hilbert Space instead of just utilizing ψ is because Hilbert
Space provides a rich mathematical, abstract structure where various manipulations
are straightforward and easy to do (Shankar 1988; Bondar et al. 2012). We can very
easily, for instance, change our basis of interest from one to another. We can ‘de-
construct’ functions and put them in various representations. This is not a ﬂexibility
given by simply using ψ. As we will see, changing representations is a fundamental
ingredient to QM, so the Hilbert Space form is absolutely necessary.
2One way you can think of an ‘equation of state’ is, for instance, the ideal gas law, PV = NkT.
This equation will tell you what the state of the system, i.e., what the pressure P, volume V , number
of gas particles N, and temperature T, for an ideal gas is.

2.2
Operators and Commutators
An operator is a mathematical object that “acts on” a function, vector, or matrix to
produce a new function (the derivative), a new vector, or a new matrix. For example,
the derivative d
dt acting on a function f(t) is an operator, as is a matrix M acting on
a vector |v⟩. The operator produces a new mathematical entity, such as the df(t)
dt from
f(t) or a new vector |v′⟩from the original vector (|v′⟩= M |v⟩). All operators will
be represented with triangular “hats”, for example, ˆA.
Two important types of operators are Hermitian operators and anti-Hermitian op-
erators, which obey the following rules respectively:
ˆA† = ˆA,
ˆA† = −ˆA,
where the † symbol is the transpose with complex conjugate as before. The operators
we most use in QM are Hermitian operators. Hermitian operators are incredibly
useful to utilize, because if we take the † of an expression with a Hermitian operator,
the form of the Hermitian operator is left unchanged. For example, for two vectors
|v⟩and |w⟩and Hermitian operator ˆH:
(⟨w| ˆH |v⟩)† = ⟨v| ˆH† |w⟩= ⟨v| ˆH |w⟩.
An observable in QM is a property of a system you would like to measure or observe.
Examples of observables in QM would be the position of a particle, its momentum,
its spin, etc. Observables in QM are given by Hermitian operators ˆA acting on the
state vector |ψ(t)⟩, i.e., ˆA |ψ(t)⟩. The state vector |ψ(t)⟩is a vector in Hilbert Space
that contains complete dynamical information about the system in question.
Hermitian operators relate directly to properties you measure inside the labora-
tory. For any generic operator ˆA, there exist special types of ket vectors which when
acted on by an operator ˆA they equal themselves rescaled by a constant. In other
7

words, they obey the mathematical form of
ˆA |ψ(t)⟩= A |ψ(t)⟩,
(5)
where ‘A’ is always a real number (Shankar 1988).
Note that this special relationship is not true for just any vector |ψ(t)⟩. This is only
true for speciﬁc vectors which we will call eigenkets. The rescaling real number ‘A’
is known as the eigenvalue, and the mathematical problem to identify for an operator
ˆA the correct eigenkets and eigenvalues is called the eigenvalue problem(Shankar
1988)3. The eigenvalue problem is central to QM because it directly relates to the
observables measured in the laboratory, as will be developed below.
Perhaps one of the most important properties of a Hermitian operator is that its
eigenvalues must necessarily always be real (Shankar 1988). Other types of opera-
tors might give, for example, imaginary eigenvalues. Hermitian operators will only
give you real numbers, which are the types of values we would measure inside the
laboratory.
Two very important operators are the ones for the observables momentum and
position. In coordinate representation (as other representations are possible), the mo-
mentum and coordinate operators are given respectively as follows:
ˆp = ℏ
i
∂
∂q,
(6)
ˆq = q.
(7)
These operators are important, because as we shall see, they are related to the average
momentum and position of interest. 4
3The function version of the eigenvalue problem is ˆAψ = Aψ, where ψ is called an eigenfunction.
To recover the Hilbert Space version, remember the colloquial transformation ψ =⇒|ψ(t)⟩. In the
literature, terms like eigenvectors and eigenfunctions are used interchangeably, as they are technically
the same thing, just one written in an abstract Hilbert Space and one written without.
4For example, in standard function form one can easily show that the ˆpψ = pψ where p is the
momentum expectation value measurable in the laboratory and ˆp is the above momentum operator.
Earlier, we said that a common form of ψ in conﬁguration space is ψ = ReiS/ℏ, where R is the
8

Commutators describe relations between operators. The principle that two num-
bers A and B obey A · B = B · A is known as the principle of commutativity.
Operators do not need to, however, obey the principle of commutativity. We might
have, for example, that ˆA ˆB ̸= ˆB ˆA for two operators ˆA and ˆB. This might be most
explicitly clear when we think about the example of matrix multiplication. The order
matrices are multiplied in might give you diﬀerent end products. We say therefore
that matrix multiplication is noncommutative.
In order to describe this property for operators, we use the idea of a commutator.
For two operators ˆA and ˆB, the commutator is deﬁned as:
[ ˆA, ˆB] ≡ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA.
If the commutator equals zero, the two operators commute:
[ ˆA, ˆB] = ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA = 0 =⇒ˆA ˆB = ˆB ˆA.
However, if the commutator is nonzero, then obviously the operators do not commute.
The position and momentum operators are an example of noncommuting opera-
tors. It can be demonstrated that:
[ˆq, ˆp] = ˆqˆp −ˆpˆq = qℏ
i
∂
∂q −ℏ
i
∂
∂qq.
[ˆq, ˆp]ψ = qℏ

∂q(qψ) = qℏ
i
∂ψ
∂q −ℏ
i
∂q
∂qψ −qℏ

∂q = −ℏ
i ψ.
Ergo, the commutator relation for ˆq and ˆp is
amplitude of the wavefunction and S is the Action. Let’s assume a simple, one dimensional case
where R = R(t) and S = S(q, t). Then we would have:
ˆpψ = ℏ
i
∂
∂q ReiS/ℏ= ℏ
i ReiS/ℏi
ℏ
∂S
∂q = ∂S
∂q ψ.
From CM, we know that p = ∂S
∂q , so the shoe ﬁts. Please note that this exercise is a bit of an over-
simpliﬁcation. Generally, R = R(t) is not considered a legitimate choice because it can lead to
nonnormalizable wavefunctions (see Tipler 2010 for further discussion.) For the sake of a simple
demonstration of how operators acting on wavefunctions lead to eigenvalues measured in the labora-
tory, I chose this oversimpliﬁed approach to highlight connections between ideas .

i ψ = iℏψ =⇒[ˆq, ˆp] = iℏ.

This is the famous Heisenberg Canonical Commutator (Shankar 1988). In section
5.2 we will derive the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from the Canonical Com-
mutator. The following are some important commutator relationships given below
with derivation for brevity:
[ ˆA, ˆB] = −[ ˆB, ˆA].

Expectation Values and the Eigenvalue Problem of Quantum
Mechanics
What exactly are the eigenvalues that we get out of the eigenvalue problem? I have
stated before that they are linked to measured observables, but in what way exactly?
Observables can be anything you would like to measure, such as the momentum or
position of a quantum particle.
Eigenvalues are going to be the numbers you measure directly inside the labora-
tory. If you conduct an experiment on a quantum system, the eigenvalues will be the
exact numbers you record. Remember that for a Hermitian operator, its eigenvalues
10

will always be real numbers. This is critical, because any number you measure in an
experiment will be real instead of, say, complex.
Eigenvalues are connected to ﬁnding the expectation values of an experiment.
Imagine you conduct an experiment on a quantum system and you measure the po-
sition or momentum. Instead of predicting individual momenta or position, QM can
predict the weighted mean value that you should expect. If you took many measure-
ments on identical systems, and took the weighted average of all those measurements,
the value you get out of this is the expectation value.
I will demonstrate how expectation values arise in QM in the following. I will
use both the Hilbert Space formulism and the function ψ that some might be more
comfortable with. Both derivations will end up with identical conclusions.
First, start with the eigenvalue expression ˆAψ = Aψ and multiply both sides by
the complex conjugate, like so:
ψ∗ˆAψ = ψ∗Aψ = Aψ∗ψ
In Hilbert Space, the same can be achieved by multiplying the eigenvalue expression
ˆA |ψ(t)⟩= A |ψ(t)⟩with a bra vector from the left, so that the operator is ‘sand-
wiched’:
⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| A |ψ(t)⟩
For the typical function form, we are going to multiply both sides by the ‘operator’
´ ∞
−∞dx, in order to get:
ˆ ∞
−∞
ψ∗ˆAψdx =
ˆ ∞
−∞
Aψ∗ψdx
(14)
We now introduce a fundamental postulate of QM, namely, the Born Rule. The
Born Rule states that ρ = ψ∗ψ where ρ represents the probability density for contin-
uous ψ. From probability theory, we know that if a probability density is integrated
11

over all possible states, it must be equal to 1 (the renormalization condition):
ˆ ∞
−∞
ψ∗ψdx = 1
(15)
In other words, the probability of something happening is certain (= 1) if all possible
outcomes occur. The equivalent renormalization condition in Hilbert Space is that
⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩= 1.5
Equation (14) is deﬁned to be the expectation value of the observable given by
operator ˆA, as can be seen from the similarity of both:
⟨f(x)⟩=
ˆ ∞
−∞
f(x)ρ dx ⇐⇒
ˆ ∞
−∞
ψ∗ˆAψdx =
ˆ ∞
−∞
Aψ∗ψdx,
where you can see that the eigenvalue A takes on the role of f(x) in the above expres-
sion and ψ∗ψ is the probability density. Please keep in mind that there could be many
diﬀerent values you can measure for observable A, so it makes sense it is equivalent
to the function f(x). Therefore the expectation value of observable A is given by
⟨A⟩=
ˆ ∞
−∞
ψ∗ˆAψdx = ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩.
(16)
The expectation values measured in the laboratory happen to be the exact ones pre-
dicted by the above equation. The expectation value expression was strictly derived
from the eigenvalue problem and the Born Rule.
5Both renormalization conditions can be shown to be equivalent. From Appendix A, we have the
important completeness theorem, which says:
I =
ˆ
dx |x⟩⟨x|
Since I is just the identity operator (operator where I ˆA = ˆA or I |ψ⟩= |ψ⟩, just like multiplying
something by the number ‘1’), we can do the following operations:
⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| I |ψ(t)⟩=
ˆ
⟨ψ(t)|x⟩⟨x|ψ(t)⟩dx
Recall from before that we have said that ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(x, t), so we get:
⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩=
ˆ
ψ∗ψdx

Review of Dirac Delta Functional
The Dirac delta functional is important to QM for the renormalization of all the basis
vectors. For any Hilbert Space, one can ﬁnd an orthogonal set of bases to represent it.
But we can do one better - one can always ﬁnd an orthonormal basis. An orthonormal
basis is a basis where not only are all the basis vectors orthogonal, but they are also
normalized to unit length 1:
|A⟩normalized =
|A⟩
p
⟨A|A⟩
(17)
Any two generic vectors |A⟩and |A′⟩in Hilbert Space are orthonormal if and only if
they satisfy
⟨A|A′⟩= δAA′ =







1
if |A⟩= |A′⟩
0
if |A⟩̸= |A′⟩
where δAA′ is the Kronecker delta. The Kronecker delta functional is however only
appropriate when dealing with strictly discrete systems. Many problems in QM, how-
ever, can be either discrete or continuous. We therefore need a functional that can
encompass both discrete and continuous systems to describe an orthonormal basis.
This is done by using the Dirac delta functional6:
. ⟨A|A′⟩= δ(A −A′)
(18)
The Dirac delta functional is a generalization of the Kronecker delta (Shankar 1988).
The Dirac delta functional obeys the following properties:
δ(A −A′) = 0 if A ̸= A′.
ˆ b
a
δ(A −A′) dA′ = 1 if a ≤A ≤b.
6Please note that the A here is a generic placeholder variable with arbitrary units. It could be
a placeholder for position q, momentum p, or some other measurable quantity. So you could, for
example, have ⟨q|q′⟩= δ(q −q′) for position and ⟨p|p′⟩= δ(p −p′) for momentum, etc.
13

The functional is zero everywhere but at A′ (Shankar 1988).
The Dirac delta functional should not be treated as a regular function. It has its
own unique properties and form, distinct from how functions behave. For example,
the area under a single point when A = A′ should be zero (the area under a point is
zero). But for the Dirac delta functional, it is precisely 1. This and other properties
of this functional highlight the fact that it should not by treated like the functions
you have seen up to this point. It is a functional, not a function. It is, however,
fundamental to the renormalization of vectors in Hilbert Space.
Other important properties of the functional we will utilize in the text of this
article include the following:
ˆ
δ(A −A′)f(A′)dA′ = f(A).
(19)
δ(A −A′) = δ(A′ −A).

2.5
Summary of Quantum Mechanics and its Postulates
The postulates of QM can be reviewed as follows (Shankar 1988; Bondar et al. 2012):
14

1. The state of a quantum system (particle or collection of particles) is represented
by a vector |ψ⟩in complex Hilbert Space.
2. For any observable A, there is an associated Hermitian operator ˆA with eigen-
value problem ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩where |A⟩is the speciﬁc eigenket and A is the
eigenvalue which is measured in the laboratory. Examples of common observ-
ables are position of a particle q and momentum p. The variables position q
and momentum p are represented by Hermitian operators ˆq and ˆp which obey
the following properties: ⟨q| ˆq |q′⟩= qδ(q−q′) and ⟨q| ˆp |q′⟩= −iℏd
dqδ(q−q′).
3. Born Rule: For a continuous distribution, the probability density for a particle
is ρ = ψ∗ψ. Equivalently in Dirac Notation, it can be written that the proba-
bility density of observing A is ρ(A) ∝⟨ψ|A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩= ∥⟨A|ψ⟩∥2 where “∝”
is the proportionality sign. More precisely we could say that the Born Rule
dictates that
ρ(A) = ⟨ψ|A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩
As long as the above equation meets the renormalization condition ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1
(see equation (15) and associated footnote), the Born Rule in its ﬁnal form is
often written as
ρ(A) = ⟨ψ|A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩
For a discrete system, the Born Rule is written as:
P(A) = ⟨ψ|A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩,
assuming renormalization, where P is the probability. For both the continu-
ous and discrete cases, the state of the system collapses from the initial state
|ψ(t)⟩to the ﬁnal state |A⟩whenever a measurement of the quantum system is
undertaken. Under the Copenhagen Interpretation of QM, the collapse of the
wavefunction |ψ⟩to the speciﬁc eigenket |A⟩is instantaneous and irreversible.
If A is observed in experiment, the wavefunction collapses to the associated
15

eigenket |A⟩.
4. The state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the subsystem’s
state spaces
There are a couple other important things to say about the above overview of QM.
Firstly, although not included as a postulate, the expectation value relationship (16)
plays a critical role inside of QM. They are of fundamental importance as we reviewed
in section 2.3.
Not discussed thoroughly is the centrality of the Schr¨odinger equation to QM.
The state of the quantum system |ψ⟩obeys the Schr¨odinger equation:
iℏ∂
∂t |ψ⟩=
h
−ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂q2 + V (q)
i
|ψ⟩= ˆH |ψ⟩
(25)
where ˆH is the quantum Hamiltonian that bears great similarity to the classical Hamil-
tonian7, except that the momentum and position are replaced by the momentum and
position operators of QM:
H(q, p) = p2
2m + V (q) =⇒ˆH(ˆq, ˆp) = ˆp2
2m + V (ˆq) = −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂q2 + V (ˆq)
Of important note, the Hamiltonian operator which acts on the wavefunction in equa-
tion (25) is Hermitian (Shankar 1988). Since it is Hermitian, its eigenvalues will al-
ways be real instead of complex or imaginary, as required for numbers measured in
the laboratory.
There will be a slight adjustment of notation from the previous couple sections.
Although it was convenient to previously write ˆA |ψ⟩= A |ψ⟩as the eigenvalue
problem, it is more precise to write the eigenvalue problem as ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩. As
described before, for an operator ˆA there are speciﬁc eigenvalues and eigenkets that
7That is, a classical Hamiltonian where the potential energy has no velocity or time dependence,
which takes on the form H(q, p) =
p2
2m + V (q). Note that p is momentum and V (q) is a one dimen-
sional potential energy.
16

satisfy the above equation. Although |ψ⟩might be used to describe the speciﬁc eigen-
ket in the context of the eigenvalue problem, |ψ⟩is often the generic state vector of
the quantum system, so this might lead to some confusion. To highlight the fact that
only speciﬁc eigenkets |A⟩satisfy this relationship, ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩will be used from
now on.
Two very important eigenvalue problems are ˆq |q⟩= q |q⟩for position q and
ˆp |p⟩= p |p⟩for momentum p. The expectation values of the position and momentum
measured in the laboratory will be the eigenvalues q and p. For any observable A,
there is a relationship ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩for which combined with the Born Rule axiom,
you can deduce the expectation value of A (as described in section 2.3).
One of the initially confusing things about the Dirac notation is that the symbols
inside the bras and kets are just labels. So you might see vector bras and kets with
labels such as |1st⟩, |2nd⟩, |I⟩, |II⟩, |ω = 2.5⟩, etc. All of these have valid nota-
tion, as the labels simply describe the associated vector, and that is all. Usually, the
eigenvalue is used to label the associated eigenket. Hence the eigenvalue ‘A’ being
associated with eigenket |A⟩in the eigenvalue problem. It is why in equation (2), we
could make a statement such as |v⟩+ |w⟩= |v + w⟩, because both v and w are just
labels.
Finally, the collapse of the wavefunction describes one of the ongoing mysteries of
QM. It can be seen that the Schr¨odinger equation is fully deterministic from equation
(25), but the collapse of the wavefunction is (as far as we know) indeterministic and
random. There is no known formula to describe how the wavefunction collapses.
More will be said about wavefunction collapse in section 5.3 of this article, in the
context of QM and CM.
2.6
The Density Operator
Before we delve straight into KvNM, it is critical to brieﬂy look at one more tool
that will be of use to us in this work. Instead of representing the state of a system as
a wavefunction vector in Hilbert Space |ψ⟩, we can instead use something called a
17

density matrix for certain systems, represented by ˆρ(t) (not to be confused with the
previously used ρ for probability density.) The density matrix is deﬁned by
ˆρ(t) =
X
j
pj |ψj(t)⟩⟨ψj(t)| ,
(26)
for the discrete case. The density matrix is used when you are not certain of the
conﬁguration of your system at some point in time. You can represent it as statistical
ensemble of possible wavefunction conﬁgurations |ψj(t)⟩, each with probability of
occurrence pj. Note with probability, we must have
X
j
pj = 1.
We will see an example of the density matrix used in action later in section 5.3.
Density matrices are good for describing the above described so-called “mixed states”
of a system (with the “pure states” being the individual wavefunctions |ψj⟩). If j = 1
in (26) the density matrix represents a pure state, but if it is greater than 1 it represents
a mixed state.
The probability of measuring A, or P(A), is given by the density matrix formu-
lation as follows:
P(A) = Tr[ˆρ(t) |a⟩⟨a|],
(27)
where Tr[...] refers to the trace of the matrix. You can represent the trace by
Tr[...] =
X
n
⟨n| ... |n⟩,
(28)
where |n⟩are arbitrary basis of your choice. This is the density matrix version of the
Born Rule. It is easy to see that this is fully equivalent to the Born Rule, for instance,
when we plug (26) with j = 1 into (27):
P(A) = ⟨a|ψ1⟩⟨ψ1|a⟩⟨a|a⟩= | ⟨A|ψ1(t)⟩|2,
(29)
18

since ⟨a|a⟩= 1 assuming orthonormality. The expectation value of operator ˆA is
given by
⟨A⟩= Tr
h
ˆAˆρ(t)
i
,
(30)
where ˆAˆρ(t) form a matrix and Tr[...] refers to the trace of the matrix. You can reduce
(30) to (16) just by applying the trace formula (28), easily demonstrated for the pure
state j = 1:
Tr
h
ˆAˆρ(t)
i
=
X
n
⟨n| ˆA |ψ1(t)⟩⟨ψ1(t)|n⟩=
X
n
⟨ψ1(t)|n⟩⟨n| ˆA |ψ1(t)⟩.
Applying resolution of identity (Theorem II of Appendix A) we get the standard ex-
pectation value formula:
Tr
h
ˆAˆρ(t)
i
= ⟨ψ1(t)| ˆA |ψ1(t)⟩= ⟨A⟩.
Other useful properties of the density matrix:
1. Tr[ˆρ(t)] = 1, which is the normalization condition.
2. Tr[ˆρ(t)2] = 1 for pure state.
3. Tr[ˆρ(t)2] < 1 for mixed state.
4. ˆρ(t) = ˆρ(t)†, in other words, ˆρ(t) is Hermitian.
(Based on MIT OpenCourseWare 2006.) We will utilize the density operator in future
sections.

Introduction to KvN Mechanics
Koopman-von Neumann Mechanics is unique because it is a form of classical statis-
tical mechanics that truly takes on a lot of the mathematical structure of QM (Koop-
19

man 1931; von Neumann 1932; Bondar et al. 2012). It was invented in the 1930’s by
Bernard Koopman and John von Neumann. Subsequently forgotten for some time by
most physicists, its resurgence raises intriguing questions about the nature of QM to
CM. Just like with QM, we have a set of operators that act on vectors in Hilbert Space
in order to retrieve eigenvalues of observables (Koopman 1931; von Neumann 1932;
Bondar et al. 2012). In order to have a proper Hilbert Space, we ﬁrst must deﬁne the
inner product of that Hilbert Space (Koopman 1931):
⟨ψ|φ⟩=
ˆ
dA ⟨ψ|A⟩⟨A|φ⟩=
ˆ
dA ψ∗(A)φ(A).
CM always has distinct trajectories that particles travel along. In QM, we have the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which states you cannot have both a well deﬁned
position of a particle and traveling momentum (or velocity) at the same time. Un-
der the Copenhagen Interpretation, this is not due to some principle of measurement,
rather, this is a fundamental property of the fabric of reality (Shankar 1988). Reality
forbids quantum particles from having a precise momentum and position simultane-
ously. In QM, trajectories could be viewed as being “fuzzy” instead of well deﬁned
and localized like in CM. You can no longer draw nice curves to describe how a
particle travels in space under QM.
Because of this fact, both position and momentum would have a common set of
eigenstates in KvN Hilbert Space (Bondar et al. 2013; McCaul and Bondar 2021).
The state vectors for KvN would therefore have the following properties (Koopman
1931):
|A⟩= |q, p⟩= |q⟩⊗|p⟩,
ˆq |q, p⟩= q |q, p⟩,
ˆp |q, p⟩= p |q, p⟩,
20

⟨q, p|q′, p′⟩= δ(q −q′)δ(p −p′),
ˆ
dp dq |q, p⟩⟨q, p| = I.
(31)
The observable A’s eigenket |A⟩is the KvN ket |q, p⟩because of the common set of
eigenstates between q and p. Because it contains information about q and p, this is
providing information in phase space instead of the previously discussed conﬁgura-
tion space (Koopman 1931). Previously for conﬁguration space we had ⟨q|ψ(t)⟩=
ψ(q, t),8 whereas here we will have ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(q, p, t) in phase space.
In QM, we have the Schr¨odinger equation (25) to dictate to us the time evolution of
the quantum particle described by |ψ⟩. To estimate the probability of an observable,
we utilize ρ(A, t) = ψ∗(A, t)ψ(A, t) = | ⟨A|ψ(t)⟩|2 (Born Rule). In CM, we have the
following equation known as the Louiville Equation to describe classical trajectories:
∂ρ
∂t +
X ∂H
∂pj
∂ρ
∂qj
−∂H
∂qj
∂ρ
∂pj

= 0
(32)
The Louiville Equation is important because it tells you the probability density ρ of
ﬁnding a particle in observable point ω = (q, p) in phase space. In other words, it
deﬁnes the probabilistic time evolution of an ensemble of particles. We can deﬁne
the Louiville operator to be (Mauro 2003):
ˆL =
X 
−i∂H
∂pj
∂
∂qj
+ i∂H
∂qj
∂
∂pj

(33)
By doing so, we can rewrite equation (32) in operational terms:
i∂ρ
∂t = ˆLρ
(34)
Notice each term in equation (33) has been multiplied by the imaginary unit i. Just
8Which can be generalized into ⟨q1, q2, q3, ..., qn|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(q1, q2, q3, ..., qn, t) for conﬁguration
space.
21

like in QM, we postulate a Born Rule for this probability density. If ρ(A, t) = ψ∗ψ
(where A is the observable), then we can easily show that 9
i∂ψ
∂t = ˆLψ
(35)
This equation, of course, bears a striking resemblance to equation (25), the Schr¨odinger
equation in its operatorial form. The classical wavefunction ψ here is interpreted as a
probability density amplitude, like under most interpretations of QM (Shankar 1988).
Just like with QM, KvN depends on the generic state vector |ψ(t)⟩containing statis-
tical information about the system. Colloquially, just as before, ψ =⇒|ψ(t)⟩.
An important property of KvN Mechanics is that the Louiville operator ˆL is Her-
mitian, just like the Hamiltonian operator of the Schr¨odinger equation. The norm
of ⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩=
´
dωψ∗(ω)ψ(ω) is therefore conserved, further strengthening the
Born’s Rule postulated for KvN Mechanics (Mauro 2003).
The Axioms of KvN Mechanics can be summarized as follows (based oﬀBondar
et al. 2012):
1. The state of a system is represented by a vector |ψ⟩in a complex Hilbert Space.
2. For any observable A, there is an associated Hermitian operator ˆA with eigen-
value problem ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩where |A⟩is the speciﬁc eigenket and A is the
eigenvalue measured in the laboratory.
3. Born Rule: The probability of measuring A is given by P(A) = | ⟨A|ψ(t)⟩|2.
The wavefunction |ψ⟩describing the system instantaneously collapses into the

eigenket |A⟩associated with the observed eigenvalue A.
4. The state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the subsystems’
state space
Notice, these are exactly the same postulates of QM in section 2.5, just with anything
“quantum” removed (Bondar et al. 2012). The formula for the expectation value of
the system is still the same, since Axioms 2 and 3 remain unchanged, and therefore
the derivation in section 2.3 is the same. The very important expectation value rule
(16) therefore still applies in KvNM.
Given these four ‘universal’ postulates, one can derive both QM and KvNM from
the Ehrenfest Theorems. The Ehrenfest Theorems are as follows:
d
dt⟨q⟩= ⟨p⟩
m ,
(36)
d
dt⟨p⟩= ⟨−V ′(q)⟩,
(37)
and are usually considered strictly within the context of QM.
Under QM, the fabric of reality forbids the mutual existence of a well deﬁned
position and momentum. Under CM, we can know the position and momentum to an
arbitrary precision. This diﬀerence is encoded with the commutator relationship. In
section 5.3, we will show that the Canonical Commutator of QM (8) directly produces
the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We can also write a commutator relationship
for CM under the axioms of KvNM. We can say:
[ˆq, ˆp] = 0
(38)
I shall call this the “Classical Commutator”. This commutator relationship would
produce no uncertainty relationship between the classical position q and momentum
p. Ergo, position and momentum can be arbitrarily known.
For QM, one can show that the Canonical Commutator combined with the Ehren-
fest Theorem produces the traditional Schr¨odinger equation with quantum Hamilto-
23

nian. We will demonstrate this as follows. According to the common set of Axioms,
we can say that the expectation value of observable A is simply ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩(16).
Therefore we can easily say that
⟨q⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆq |ψ(t)⟩
⟨p⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩
Then from the Ehrenfest Theorems one can carry out the following operations:
d
dt ⟨ψ(t)| ˆq |ψ(t)⟩= 1
m ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩,
d
dt ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| −V ′(ˆq) |ψ(t)⟩.
We are using the Schr¨odinger picture of QM, so we assume time dependence
solely resides in |ψ(t)⟩and any operators are independend of time.
10 Using the
chain rule of calculus, we write:
dψ(t)
dt
 ˆq |ψ(t)⟩+ ⟨ψ(t)| ˆq

dψ(t)

dψ(t)
dt

= ⟨ψ(t)| −V ′(ˆq) |ψ(t)⟩.
(39)
Stone’s Theorem (see Appendix B) dictates that there exists a unique Schr¨odinger-like
equation i ∂
∂t |ψ⟩= ˆG |ψ⟩where ˆG is the Hermitian generator of motion in operator
form. We deduce there must be a ˆG that governs the evolution of CM, just as the
Hamiltonian operator does for QM. The only thing is to ﬁgure out what this generator
ˆG is.
For QM, we can derive what the generator of motion is by using the commutator
relationships. We can take Stone’s Theorem and then derive:
10This is the opposite of the Heisenberg picture, which assumes no time dependence in the wave-
function vector ket and puts all the time dependence inside the operators!

iℏ|ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| −V ′(ˆq) |ψ(t)⟩
You can expand the vector ‘sandwich’ and rewrite it in terms of a commutator to get:
⟨ψ(t)| −ˆHˆq + ˆq ˆH |ψ(t)⟩= −⟨ψ(t)| [ ˆH, ˆq] |ψ(t)⟩= iℏ
m ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩
⟨ψ(t)| −ˆH ˆp + ˆp ˆH |ψ(t)⟩= −⟨ψ(t)| [ ˆH, ˆp] |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| −iℏV ′(ˆq) |ψ(t)⟩
Since the Ehrenfest Theorems are true regardless of the particular state of the system
|ψ(t)⟩(i.e., they are true for any state you might ﬁnd), we can remove the wavefunc-
tion vector from both sides to get:
−[ ˆH, ˆq] = iℏ
m ˆp
[ ˆH, ˆp] = iℏV ′(ˆq)
(40)
We will make the assumption that ˆH = H(ˆq, ˆp) and utilize Theorem VI from Ap-
pendix A. By this Theorem, we have ˆq = ˆA1, ˆp = ˆA2, and H(ˆq, ˆp) = f( ˆA1, ˆA2).
Therefore:
[ ˆH, ˆq] = [H(ˆq, ˆp), ˆq] =
n=2
X
k=1
[ ˆAk, ˆq]∂H( ˆA1, ˆA2)
∂ˆAk
= [ˆq, ˆq]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
+ [ˆp, ˆq]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
25

[ ˆH, ˆp] = [H(ˆq, ˆp), ˆp] =
n=2
X
k=1
[ ˆAk, ˆp]∂H( ˆA1, ˆA2)
∂ˆAk
= [ˆq, ˆp]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
+ [ˆp, ˆp]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
A commutator with itself will always equal zero:
[ˆq, ˆq] = ˆqˆq −ˆqˆq = 0
[ˆp, ˆp] = ˆpˆp −ˆpˆp = 0
Ergo, the above expressions based in Theorem VI reduce to:
[ ˆH, ˆq] = [ˆp, ˆq]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
[ ˆH, ˆp] = [ˆq, ˆp]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
Plugging these expressions into (40) gives us:
−[ˆp, ˆq]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
= iℏ
m ˆp
[ˆq, ˆp]∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
= iℏV ′(ˆq)
(41)
From the Canonical Commutator we know that [ˆq, ˆp] = iℏ.11 This step is absolutely
critical. It is in fact the step that is going to distinguish QM from classical KvNM
- the usage of the Canonical Commutator. We are going to plug in the Canonical
Commutator to the above expressions, so that we will get:
∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
= ˆp
m
11We will also use the fact that [ˆq, ˆp] = −[ˆp, ˆq]. It’s not hard to prove, just takes a couple lines of
algebra:
[ˆq, ˆp] = ˆqˆp −ˆpˆq = −(−ˆqˆp + ˆpˆq) = −(ˆpˆq −ˆqˆp) = −[ˆp, ˆq]
26

∂H(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
= dV (ˆq)
dˆq
Theorem VII of Appendix A will be useful, as we can now translate this expression
with operators into more familiar analytical functions in order to do operations with
derivations. We will have the following analytical functions as a result of Theorem
VII:
∂H(q, p)
∂p
= p
m
∂H(q, p)
∂q
= dV (q)
dq
Some basic calculus reveals:
ˆ ∂H(q, p)
∂p
dp = H(q, p) =
ˆ
p
mdp = p2
2m + C(q)
where C(q) is some function solely in terms of q so that it disappears when the partial
with respect to p is taken. Taking the partial derivative with respect to q of the above
expression reveals:
∂H(q, p)
∂q
= dC(q)
dq
= dV (q)
dq
Ergo, C(q) = V (q) so that the ﬁnal solution is H(ˆq, ˆp) =
ˆp2
2m +V (ˆq), which happens
to be equivalent to the quantum Hamiltonian. Therefore, plugging this solution of ˆH
into the above version of Stone’s Theorem we reclaim the Schr¨odinger equation(25):
iℏ∂
∂t |ψ⟩=
h ˆp2
2m + V (ˆq)
i
|ψ⟩
The same series of steps can be carried out to derive KvNM. The only diﬀer-
ence in the derivation is that we will assume the Classical Commutator instead of
the Canonical Commutator. Once again we start with the Ehrenfest Theorems and
follow a similar series of steps. Starting from (39), we will utilize Stone’s Theorem
27

as i ∂
∂t |ψ⟩= ˆK |ψ⟩to get:
−⟨ψ(t)|
ˆK
i ˆq |ψ(t)⟩+ ⟨ψ(t)| ˆq
ˆK
i |ψ(t)⟩= 1
m ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩
−⟨ψ(t)|
ˆK
i ˆp |ψ(t)⟩+ ⟨ψ(t)| ˆp
ˆK
i |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| −V ′(ˆq) |ψ(t)⟩
Following a similar series of steps, we can derive that:
−[ ˆK, ˆq] = i
m ˆp
[ ˆK, ˆp] = iV ′(ˆq)
(42)
Now we run into a problem. If we assume ˆK = K(ˆq, ˆp) as before, then we will derive
once again (41). However, now we will utilize the Classical Commutator instead of
the Canonical Commutator, since we want well deﬁned classical trajectories. By
imposing the Classical Commutator [ˆq, ˆp] = 0, we run into a contradiction, namely:
−[ˆp, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
= (0)∂K(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆp
= 0 = i
m ˆp =⇒p = 0
[ˆq, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
= (0)∂K(ˆq, ˆp)
∂ˆq
= 0 = iV ′(ˆq) =⇒dV
dq = 0
Obviously, this cannot be true for all systems, because many classical systems def-
initely have a nonzero momentum. This contradiction between theory and observa-
tion suggests that we must approach this from a diﬀerent angle. One such angle is to
propose two new operators ˆθ and ˆλ (Bondar et al. 2012). These operators obey the
eigenvalue problems, ˆθ |θ⟩= θ |θ⟩and ˆλ |λ⟩= λ |λ⟩, by postulate 2 of the ‘universal
axioms’, but are not tied to any direct physically observable features of reality (as
noted in Ramos-Prieto et al. 2018).12 They serve as an analogue to Lagrange Multi-
pliers (McCaul and Bondar 2021), serving to constrain the realm of possible behavior
to a very speciﬁc subset.
12Even though these operators are not directly physically observable, their existence has been seen
through indirect means. These operators are the famous Bopp Operators of the phase-space formula-
tion of QM (Bondar et al. 2013). We will explore the Wigner Distribution in section 6.
28

For KvNM, we will postulate the following behavior for these operators:
[ˆq, ˆθ] = [ˆp, ˆλ] = i
[ˆqc, ˆpc] = [ˆq, ˆλ] = [ˆp, ˆθ] = [ˆθ, ˆλ] = 0
(43)
where i is the imaginary unit. Equations (43) make up what is known as the Koopman-
von Neumann Algebra. If we do this, then we can assume ˆK = K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ). By
Theorem VI of Appendix A again, we will get:
[K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ), ˆq] =
n=4
X
k=1
[ ˆAk, ˆq]∂K( ˆA1, ˆA2, ˆA3, ˆA4)
∂ˆAk
= [ˆq, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆq
+[ˆp, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆp
+[ˆθ, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆθ
+ [ˆλ, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆλ
[K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ), ˆp] =
n=4

k=1
[ ˆAk, ˆp]∂K( ˆA1, ˆA2, ˆA3, ˆA4)
∂ˆAk
= [ˆq, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆq
+[ˆp, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆp
+[ˆθ, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆθ
+ [ˆλ, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆλ
Three terms from each expression will disappear because of the KvN Algebra above
and the Classical Commutator. The equations of motion will end up being:
[ˆθ, ˆq]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆθ
= −i
m ˆp
[ˆλ, ˆp]∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆλ
= iV ′(ˆq)
(44)
Once we substitute in [ˆq, ˆθ] = [ˆp, ˆλ] = i we will simply have:
∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆθ
= ˆp
m
29

∂K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ)
∂ˆλ
= −V ′(ˆq)
Utilizing Theorem VII again, we get the diﬀerential equations:
∂K(q, p, θ, λ)
∂θ
= p
m
∂K(q, p, θ, λ)
∂λ
= −V ′(q)
Which we proceed to solve:
ˆ ∂K(q, p, θ, λ)
∂θ
dθ = K(q, p, θ, λ) =
ˆ
p
mdθ = pθ
m + C(q, p, λ)

∂λ

ˆ ∂C(q, p, λ)
∂λ
dλ = C(q, p, λ) = −
ˆ V (q)
dq dλ = −V (q)
dq λ + C(q, p)
We can therefore derive
ˆK = K(ˆq, ˆp, ˆθ, ˆλ) = ˆpˆθ
m −V ′(ˆq)ˆλ + C(ˆq, ˆp)
(45)
which is the important Koopman Generator of KvNM. The Koopman Generator will
become very important when we discuss the Path Integral Formulation of QM and
CM (section 4).
We can show that the Koopman Generator gives us the Louiville Equations again
and produces the KvN classical wavefunction. To show this is quite straightforward.
Since the Born Rule for KvNM postulates that ρ = | ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩|2, let us try to use the
Koopman Generator to ﬁnd an expression that governs the evolution of the classical
probability density.
First, refer to (31). From these basic properties, one can easily show the following:
⟨q, p| ˆq |ψ(t)⟩= [⟨q, p| ˆq] |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p| q |ψ(t)⟩= q ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
(46)
30

⟨q, p| ˆp |ψ(t)⟩= [⟨q, p| ˆp] |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p| p |ψ(t)⟩= p ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
(47)
Using Theorem IV from Appendix A, we can demonstrate that the following are true.
Since [ˆq, ˆθ] = i, we can set κ = 1, |A⟩= |q, p⟩, and B = θ for the parameters in
Theorem IV. We can say that the following is true then:
⟨q, p| ˆθ |ψ(t)⟩= −i ∂
∂q ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
(48)
Notice that although A = (q, p), we do not write a partial derivative with respect to
p, and that is because [ˆp, ˆθ] = 0 per the Koopman Algebra.
The same can be done with [ˆp, ˆλ] = i. Using Theorem IV with parameters κ = 1,
|A⟩= |q, p⟩, and B = λ, we get:
⟨q, p| ˆλ |ψ(t)⟩= −i ∂
∂p ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
(49)
Again, there is no partial with respect to q here, since [ˆq, ˆλ] = 0 per the Koopman
Algebra.
Plugging the Koopman Generator into Stone’s Theorem gives us:
i ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= ˆK |ψ(t)⟩=
h ˆpˆθ
m −V ′(ˆq)ˆλ + C(ˆq, ˆp)
i
|ψ(t)⟩
And now we will ‘sandwich’ it from the left hand side with the vector bra ⟨q, p| and
work out the algebra:
⟨q, p| i ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p|
h ˆpˆθ
m −V ′(ˆq)ˆλ + C(ˆq, ˆp)
i
|ψ(t)⟩
i ∂
∂t ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p| ˆpˆθ
m |ψ(t)⟩−⟨q, p| V ′(ˆq)ˆλ |ψ(t)⟩+ ⟨q, p| C(ˆq, ˆp) |ψ(t)⟩
31

Utilizing Theorems I of Appendix A13and equations (46),(47),(48) and (49), we can
derive:
i ∂
∂t ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= p
m ⟨q, p| ˆθ |ψ(t)⟩−V ′(q) ⟨q, p| ˆλ |ψ(t)⟩+ C(q, p) ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
i ∂
∂t ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= −i p

∂
∂q ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩+ iV ′(q) ∂
∂p ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩+ C(q, p) ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩
(50)
We can derive the time evolution equation for the probability density by utilizing
equation (50) above. This will be done in this fashion:
i ∂
∂t| ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩|2 = i ∂
∂t[⟨ψ(t)|q, p⟩⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩] =
= i ∂
∂t[⟨ψ(t)|q, p⟩] ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩+ i ⟨ψ(t)|q, p⟩∂
∂t[⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩]
Into this equation plug in (50) and its complex conjugate:

∂
∂q| ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩|2 + iV ′(q) ∂
∂p| ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩|2
Since | ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩|2 = ρ, the probability density, we can see right away that this
equation is fully equivalent to the Louiville equation (32)14, and that ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩=
ψ(q, p, t) is the previously identiﬁed KvN classical wavefunction in phase space.
In summary, KvNM is a classical theory of physics that utilizes complex Hilbert
Spaces, just like in QM. Like QM, it is probabilistic in nature, so it can only make
probabilistic predictions of classical systems. Like in QM, you have a wavefunction
that completely describes the state of the system (35). This wavefunction is in phase
space, and KvNM is a phase space theory. It operates on the same axioms as QM,
but is a fully classical theory. It is not an extension of classical theory, but fully
equivalent to it, recast in a non-traditional form. The mathematical conveniences of
QM exist in KvNM. For example, one reason QM has its odd Hilbert Space form is
to conveniently change between vector bases. One can do this in KvNM with equal
ease. Just like in QM, the expectation value of observable A is given by ⟨A⟩=
⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩.
The backbone of KvNM lies in the standard Hilbert Space behaviors (31), the
Koopman Generator (45), and the Koopman Algebra (43), which lets one derive the
Louiville Equation governing classical probabilities via usage of the KvNM classical
wavefunction. One can derive KvNM from the Ehrenfest Theorems by assuming the

Classical Commutator. The main diﬀerence between Classical and Quantum Physics
appears to lie in the choice of the commutator for position q and momentum p (Bondar
et al. 2012).
In the pages that follow, we will demonstrate the many applications of KvNM.
Even though technically it is strictly equivalent to any classical theory, it allows for
a wide variety of applications and uses. KvNM is a very important and convenient
tool for statistical physics.

Path Integral Formulation of Quantum and Classi-
cal Mechanics
4.1
Feynman Path Integral of Quantum Mechanics
Feynman Path Integral is another formulation of QM that is completely equivalent to
the Schr¨odinger equation. It was invented by the famous physicist Richard Feynman
in 1948 and has applications many usages in QM, some which you will see in this
Thesis. Whereas the Schr¨odinger equation is more analogous to Hamiltonian Dy-
namics (for instance, see section 5.1 for the similarity to Hamilton-Jacobi Theory),
the Path Integral is more analogous to Lagrangian Dynamics (Shankar 1988).
Under Lagrangian Dynamics in Classical Theory, you select two points, a starting
point and an endpoint point. In the allowed time interval, the classical particle would
take the path where the function S, called the Action, would be minimized. From
CM, the term T −V is called the Lagrangian (where T is kinetic energy and V is
potential energy) and the Action is deﬁned as the time integral of the Lagrangian:
S =
ˆ t
0
dt(T −V )
(51)
This function has to be minimized to deﬁne the classical path. The minimization rule
for classical particles - called the Least Action Principle or Hamilton’s Principle - is
often written as:
34

δ
ˆ t
0
dt(T −V ) = 0
Things are not so simple in Quantum Theory.
We begin with a simple derivation of the Feynman Path Integral to understand
the diﬀerences between QM and Lagrangian Theory. We start with the following
expression, which is simply a rewrite of the Schr¨odinger equation:
|ψ(t)⟩= e−i
ℏt ˆH |ψ(0)⟩
(52)
In Appendix C, one can see how this expression is completely equivalent to the
Schr¨odinger equation. One might also notice that the operator ˆH is exponated, but
this is not unusual in QM (more information about exponated operators and what
they mean is found in the same Appendix). The term exp
n
−i
ℏt ˆH
o
is called the uni-
tary time-evolution operator and deﬁnes how the quantum particle will evolve in time
from its starting condition |ψ(0)⟩to its ﬁnal condition |ψ(t)⟩at time t (see Appendix
B for more on unitary operators).
To begin, we insert a position q bra on both sides of (52):
⟨q|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(q, t) = ⟨q| e−i
ℏt ˆH |ψ(0)⟩
(53)
And then insert resolution of identity (Appendix A Theorem II) for initial position
q′:
⟨q|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(q, t) =
ˆ
dq′ ⟨q| e−i
ℏt ˆH |q′⟩⟨q′|ψ(0)⟩=
ˆ
dq′ ⟨q| e−i
ℏt ˆH |q′⟩ψ(q′, 0)
(54)
The term ⟨q| e−i
ℏt ˆH |q′⟩is called the kernell of the Path Integral. The kernell rep-
resents the probability amplitude while traveling from the starting point to the ﬁnal
point. Think of the |q′⟩= |q0⟩as the starting point in the Lagrangian formulism and
|q⟩= |qf⟩as the ﬁnal prespeciﬁed point.
35

Let ∆t be a very small change in time, where ∆t = tj+1 −tj. We will break the
total allowed time t into N equal increments, so that we have ∆t = t/N. We can
therefore write:
⟨q| e−i
ℏt ˆH |q′⟩= ⟨q| e−i
ℏ(∆t1+∆t2+...+∆tN) ˆH |q′⟩= ⟨q| e−i
ℏ∆t1 ˆH−i
ℏ∆t2 ˆH+...−i

ℏt ˆH |q′⟩= ⟨q| e−i
ℏ∆t1 ˆHe−i
ℏ∆t2 ˆH · · · e−i
ℏ∆tN ˆH |q′⟩
The subscripts on each of the ∆t are there just to make clear that we are breaking the
total time t into a large number of N increments. Since the ∆t here are very small,
we will drop the subscripts from here on out. Just keep in mind there are now a total
N exponential terms inside the above expression.
Using Theorem II of Appendix A we can insert between each exponential the
resolution of identity:
⟨qf| e−i
ℏ∆t ˆHe−i
ℏ∆t ˆH · · · e−i
ℏ∆t ˆH |q0⟩= ⟨qf| e−i

(55)
We will take one of the “bra-ket” sandwiches above and do some further opera-
tions on it. We can represent each “sandwich” as ⟨qj+1| e−i
ℏ∆t ˆH |qj⟩and plug in the
value of the Hamiltonian operator ˆH:
⟨qj+1| e−i
ℏ∆t ˆH |qj⟩= ⟨qj+1| e−i

From Theorem I of Appendix A we know that:
36

ℏ∆tV (ˆq) |qj⟩= e−i
ℏ∆tV (qj) |qj⟩
Next we apply the completeness theorem with momentum p:

ℏ∆tV (ˆq) |qj⟩=
ˆ
dp ⟨qj+1| e−i

Again applying Theorem I we know:

ℏ∆t ˆp2

so that the whole thing becomes

Equation (62) represents the ﬁnal Kernel of the Feynman Path Integral. This inte-
gral is fascinating because it says that for a ﬁxed starting point |q0⟩and ending point
|qf⟩, the quantum particle takes all possible paths inbetween within the allotted time
interval. This is like saying that if you are throwing darts at a dart board, the ﬂying
dart takes all possible paths from your hand to the bullseye. This shocking outcome
highlights another strange property of quantum particles. This goes hand in hand
with the earlier comments about quantum particles having “fuzzy” trajectories.

4.2
Koopman-von Neumann Classical Path Integral
Just like a Path Integral can be formulated for Quantum Theory, one can also formu-
late a path integral for classical theory. The path integral, however, must enforce New-
ton’s Laws and particles must travel along well deﬁned paths instead of the “fuzzy”
trajectories of QM. This classical path integral is possible thanks to the KvN for-
mulism (Mauro 2003; McCaul and Bondar 2021).
First, in order to develop the KvN Path Integral, let us develop some initial use-
ful tools. These will be ingredients we will use in a future step in making the Path
Integral. Using Theorem V of Appendix A, you can compute what expressions like
⟨q, λ|q′, p⟩are. Let A = p, B = λ, and κ = 1. Utilizing the Koopman-von Neumann
Algebra (43), you can get:
⟨q, λ|q′, p⟩= ⟨q| ⊗⟨λ| |q′⟩⊗|p⟩= ⟨q|q′⟩⟨λ|p⟩=
1
√
2πδ(q −q′)e−ipλ
(63)
Note that there is no need to evaluate ⟨q|p⟩and ⟨λ|q′⟩since [ˆq, ˆp] = 0 and [ˆλ, ˆq] = 0.
From (18), recall ⟨q|q′⟩= δ(q −q′). You can follow a similar procedure to calculate
the following two expressions:
⟨θ, p|q, p′⟩= ⟨θ| ⊗⟨p| |q⟩⊗|p′⟩= ⟨θ|q⟩⟨p|p′⟩=
1
√
2πδ(p −p′)e−iθq
(64)
⟨θ, p|q, λ⟩= ⟨θ| ⊗⟨p| |q⟩⊗|λ⟩= ⟨θ|q⟩⟨p|λ⟩= 1
2πeipλ−iθq
(65)
The three expressions above are critical ingredients which we will utilize soon.
Now we can begin with the proper formulation of the Path Integral. Similar to
(52), we will utilize
|ψ(t)⟩= e−it ˆ
K |ψ(0)⟩
(66)
40

with the Koopman Generator ˆK (45) instead of the quantum Hamiltonian ˆH.15 Since
KvNM deals with phase space, we will attack this expression with a q, p bra on the
left to get the following:
⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(q, p, t) = ⟨q, p| e−it ˆ
K |ψ(0)⟩
(67)
And like before, we will introduce the resolution of identity, this time with respect to
q′, p′:
⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩=
ˆ
dq′ dp′ ⟨q, p| e−it ˆ
K |q′, p′⟩⟨q′, p′|ψ(0)⟩=
=
ˆ
dq′ dp′ ⟨q, p| e−i
ℏt ˆ
K |q′, p′⟩ψ(q′, p′, 0)
(68)
The KvN Kernel is ⟨q, p| e−i
ℏt ˆ
K |q′, p′⟩with |q′, p′⟩= |q0, p0⟩being the initial state
of the system in phase space and |q, p⟩= |qf, pf⟩being the ﬁnal state of the system.
Again, let ∆t be a small change in time. As before in the quantum case, it is a very
small increment where we will have ∆t = t/N. We will get:
⟨q, p| e−it ˆ
K |q′, p′⟩= ⟨q, p| e−i∆t1 ˆ
Ke−i∆t2 ˆ
K · · · e−i∆tN ˆ
K |q′, p′⟩
(69)
The subscripts on each of the ∆t are there just to make clear that we are breaking the
total time t into a large number of N increments. Since the ∆t here are very small,
we will drop the subscripts from here on out. Just keep in mind there are now a total
N exponential terms inside the above expression.
Using Theorem II we can insert between each exponential a completeness rela-
tionship, as before:
⟨qf, pf| e−i∆t ˆ

K · · · e−i∆t ˆ
K |q0, p0⟩=

K |q0, p0⟩
(70)
We will take one of the “bra-ket” sandwiches above and do some further operations
on it. We can represent each “sandwich” as ⟨qj+1, pj+1| e−i∆t ˆ
K |qj, pj⟩and plug in
the value of the Koopman Generator ˆK:

Please note, in keeping with McCaul and Bondar 2021, we have omitted the constant
of integration C(ˆq, ˆp) from (45) in the following calculations. It will not aﬀect the
dynamics of the experiment for classical systems (Bondar et al. 2012; McCaul and
Bondar 2021). Next we apply the completeness theorem twice with θ, p and q, λ:

For the expressions ⟨qj+1, pj+1|θ, p⟩, ⟨θ, p|q, λ⟩, and ⟨q, λ|qj, pj⟩, we substitute in our

What is the relevance of this? This encodes the equations of CM (McCaul and Bondar
2021). The path integral is a kind of redundancy that can be shown to enforce the laws
of CM. We can show that it leads to a Dirac delta functional that enforces Newton’s
Laws.
Recall that the Dirac delta functional δ(A −A′) is nonzero when A = A′ but
44

zero if A ̸= A′. Let us use equation (72) above, as it is written in a slightly easier
to mathematically manipulate form (following the footsteps of McCaul and Bondar
2021). Let us look at the portion of the integral with respect to θj:

Next, we will utilize equation (22) for our convenience. We will take the 0th

no derivative at all):

ˆ dω
2π (−iω)0e−iω(A−A′) =

reduce the total number of variables integrated over from four to just q and λ (McCaul
and Bondar 2021). The two variable version of the Classical Path Integral ensures
CM holds (Mauro 2003; McCaul and Bondar 2021).

diﬀerent ways of enforcing the laws of CM hold true. We will go over some practical
usages of the Classical Path Integral in the pages that follow.

Classical and Quantum Comparison
5.1
The Phase in Koopman-von Neumann and Quantum Mechan-
ics
In QM, the interaction of the quantum phase S with the wavefunction amplitude R
gives rise to quantum mechanical behavior (Mauro 2003). Recall that one way of ex-
pressing the wavefunction ψ(t) is (3). If we plug this expression into the Schr¨odinger
equation (4) we get two equations:
∂S
∂t + (∇S)2
2m
−
ℏ2
2mR∇2R + V (q) = 0
(77)
46

which is the classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory with quantum potential16, and
∂R2
∂t + ∇· (R2∇S
m ) = 0
(78)
which is the continuity equation for density R2. 17 From the above expression, you
can see that the S and R are coupled together and cannot be separated from each
other in QM.
This is not the case in CM. From the KvNM equation (35), you can see if you plug
in ψ(q, p, t) = R(q, p, t)eiG(q,p,t) you will get complete decoupling of the amplitude
R from the phase G. All one has to do is plug the phase space wavefunction ψ(q, p, t)
into (35), like so:
i∂ψ
∂t = ˆLψ = i ∂
∂tR(q, p, t)eiG(q,p,t) =
h
−i p
m
∂
∂q + idV
dq
∂
∂p
i
R(q, p, t)eiG(q,p,t)
This process begets:
i∂R
∂t = ˆLR
(79)
i∂G
∂t = ˆLG
(80)
The amplitude and the phase are completely seperate. Quantum mechanics has there-
fore been described as the theory that tells how the phase interacts with the amplitude
(Mauro 2003).
If the phase and the amplitude evolve separately in KvNM, one may ask what is
16As an interesting aside, one can trivially show that the quantum potential disappears if one as-
sumes the Classical Commutator. For instance, equation (77) can be rewritten since we know that
(iℏ)2 = −ℏ2:
∂S
∂t + (∇S)2
2m
+ [ˆq, ˆp]2
2mR ∇2R + V (q) = 0
If you assume the Canonical Commutator, you retrieve the Schr¨odinger equation as is. If you assume
the Classical Commutator, you retrieve the completely classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This result
is trivial, but still interesting to consider from the perspective of unity of ideas.
17Keep in mind that if ρ = ψ∗ψ, then ρ = ψ∗ψ = Re−iS/ℏReiS/ℏ= R2.
47

the practical use of the KvNM formulism? Why the use of complex wavefunctions
if the exponated phase is completely independent of the amplitude? While it is true
that in the momentum position representation |q, p⟩of KvNM the formulism can be
redundant, one can always use the convenient properties of Hilbert Spaces to change
to other representations, which gives us new insights into CM (Bondar et al. 2012;
Bondar et al. 2013; McCaul and Bondar 2021, etc.) We will see examples of this
change in basis utilized in section 6. In order to have the most general form of CM, it
is important to write the classical wavefunction in this complex form (Mauro 2003).
5.2
Uncertainty Principle in Koopman-von Neumann and Quan-
tum Mechanics
One of the hallmarks of QM is the existence of an uncertainty principle between the
position and momentum. The uncertainty principle tells you that the more precisely
you measure where a wavefunction is localized, the less precisely you know the mo-
mentum distribution. This contrasts with CM, where you can measure the values of
both the momentum and position to an arbitrary precision at the same time. This
trade oﬀis another re-articulation of the strange property of “fuzzy” trajectories in
QM and well-deﬁned trajectories in CM.
One can naturally derive the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from the Canoni-
cal Commutator. Through the same series of steps, one can also demonstrate the lack
of an uncertainty principle between position and momentum for the KvN classical
case. The procedure is quite straightforward.
Firstly, from statistics we know that the standard deviation of some measured
quantity A is given by:
σA =
p
⟨A2⟩−⟨A⟩2
(81)
And this will be a crucial ingredient in deriving the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
48

From equation (16), we know that
⟨A⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩
⟨A2⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA2 |ψ(t)⟩
Treat ⟨A⟩as a constant. Then we can see the following important relationship:
( ˆA −⟨A⟩)2 = ˆA2 −2⟨A⟩ˆA + ⟨A⟩2,
⟨ψ(t)| [ ˆA2−2 ˆA⟨A⟩+⟨A⟩2] |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA2 |ψ(t)⟩−⟨ψ(t)| 2⟨A⟩ˆA |ψ(t)⟩+⟨ψ(t)| ⟨A⟩2 |ψ(t)⟩=
= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA2 |ψ(t)⟩−2⟨A⟩⟨ψ(t)| ˆA |ψ(t)⟩+ ⟨A⟩2 ⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩=
= ⟨ψ(t)| ˆA2 |ψ(t)⟩−2⟨A⟩2 + ⟨A⟩2 = ⟨A2⟩−⟨A⟩2.
utilizing (16) and ⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩= 1.
We have all the ingredients we need to derive the Heisenberg Uncertainty Prin-
ciple. First, let us compute the variance σ2 for both the position and momentum.
Deﬁnitionally following (81) and our above result, they would be
σ2
q = ⟨q2⟩−⟨q⟩2 = ⟨ψ(t)| (ˆq −⟨q⟩)2 |ψ(t)⟩
σ2
p = ⟨p2⟩−⟨p⟩2 = ⟨ψ(t)| (ˆp −⟨p⟩)2 |ψ(t)⟩
We can deﬁne a new vector to simplify our calculation. We can deﬁne |Q⟩= (ˆq −
⟨q⟩) |ψ(t)⟩and |P⟩= (ˆp −⟨p⟩) |ψ(t)⟩in order to write the variance of position and
momentum simply as
σ2
q = ⟨Q|Q⟩
σ2
p = ⟨P|P⟩
49

Then we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (Theorem III of Appendix A) which
tells us that:
σ2
pσ2
q = ⟨P|P⟩⟨Q|Q⟩≥| ⟨P|Q⟩|2

From this, it is simple to see that:

(84)
If we plug in the Canonical Commutator for [ˆp, ˆq] we derive the Heisenberg Uncer-
tainty Principle,
σpσq ≥ℏ/2
(85)
If we plug in the Classical Commutator for [ˆp, ˆq] = 0 there is no uncertainty rela-
tion between the position and momentum, hence there is no theoretical restriction to
knowledge of precision of both at the same time. Depending on your choice of the
Commutator, you derive either Classical or Quantum Physics (Bondar et al. 2012).
This does not, however, mean there are no uncertainty relations for KvNM. Be-
cause the Koopman Algebra (43) tells us that [ˆq, ˆθ] = i and [ˆp, ˆλ] = i, we can develop
uncertainty relationships for q-θ and p-λ by plugging the commutators into expres-
sions analogous to (84):
σpσλ ≥| ⟨ψ(t)| [ˆp, ˆλ] |ψ(t)⟩|

σqσθ ≥| ⟨ψ(t)| [ˆq, ˆθ] |ψ(t)⟩|

These would be the ‘classical’ uncertainty relationships. Since neither θ nor λ are
directly observable (Ramos-Prieto et al. 2018), these uncertainty relations will not
impact our observations of classical systems. For KvNM, many “quantum” phenom-
ena are tucked into the not directly observable operators ˆθ and ˆλ.
5.3
Measurement in Koopman-von Neumann and Quantum Me-
chanics
QM is known to have the strange property that it makes probabilistic predictions
instead of deterministic ones. One strange feature related to this fact that tucked
51

into the previously mentioned postulates of QM you have a phenomenon termed the
collapse of the wavefunction. Any wavefunction can be expanded across a basis using
the completeness theorem (Theorem II of Appendix A):
|ψ⟩= I |ψ⟩,
where I is the identity operator (analogous to the number ‘1’.) Inserting the discrete18
completeness relation we get:
|ψ⟩=
X
j
|j⟩⟨j|ψ⟩= |A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩+ |B⟩⟨B|ψ⟩+ |C⟩⟨C|ψ⟩+ · · ·,
(86)
where the collection of all |j⟩vectors (j = A, B, C, ...) are your basis vectors ac-
cording to the principles of Linear Algebra and ⟨j|ψ⟩are scalar values or functions
(recalling that ⟨j|ψ⟩= ψ(j)). This is simply expanding the state vector |ψ⟩along a
particular set of basis vectors |j⟩. A, B, C, etc., are diﬀerent eigenvalues associated
with each ‘eigenbasis’, for example, ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩.
If you measure B then the initial wavefunction |ψ⟩instantaneously collapses the
entire quantum system to state |B⟩. How the state of the system |ψ⟩instantaneously
changes to |B⟩when B is measured is still a modern day quantum mystery. As
described by Postulate 3 in section 2, the probability for observing B is P(B) =
| ⟨B|ψ⟩|2 for discrete systems and the probability density is ρ(B) = | ⟨B|ψ⟩|2 in
continuous systems.
The strange phenomenon of collapse is preserved in KvNM. You have a KvN
classical wavefunction that again can be expanded over a particular basis of your
choice
|ψ⟩= |A⟩⟨A|ψ⟩+ |B⟩⟨B|ψ⟩+ |C⟩⟨C|ψ⟩+ · · ·,
18Note that in (86) I used the discrete case instead of the continuous completeness identity. This is
simply due to the ease of highlighting certain concepts. The continuous completeness identity would
do the same thing as the discrete case, but might obscure for some readers results we will discuss.
Remember that the integral is just a continuous summation of inﬁnitely small things.
52

and that when a particular eigenvalue is observed, the system collapses to its asso-
ciated eigenbasis. The same Born Rule applies. You have the same postulate for
collapse from the set of ‘universal axioms’ .
The common behavior of the wavefunction collapsing during measurement in
QM and KvNM is mystifying, and perhaps one day further light can be shed on it.
Maybe it is a common feature of probabilistic models built in Hilbert Space, or per-
haps there will be some other explanation developed. As far as we know, the collapse
is instant, irreversible, and no causal process exists to explain it.
There is an important diﬀerence though in the collapse of the wavefunction dur-
ing measurement for the KvNM versus QM cases. The wavefunction will not col-
lapse for non-selective measurements in the KvN case but will in the QM case (Gozzi
and Mauro 2002; Mauro 2003). Non-selective measurements are measurements con-
ducted on the system where the results are not ‘read out loud’, meaning the system
would be hypothetically collapsed but we do not ‘record’, remember, or consider
which eigenbasis it collapses to. We remain completely ignorant of whether the sys-
tem state |ψ⟩hypothetically collapses into |A⟩, |B⟩, |C⟩, or some other state. This
diﬀerence in collapse for KvN and QM wavefunctions will be demonstrated (follow-
ing the work of Gozzi and Mauro 2002; Mauro 2003).
First, let us consider the QM case. Consider a Hamiltonian ˆH which obeys the
following eigenvalue relationships:
ˆH |+⟩= ℏω |+⟩,
(87)
ˆH |−⟩= −ℏω |−⟩,
(88)
where |+⟩and |−⟩are the eigenvectors and ℏω and −ℏω are the energy eigenvalues
of the operator ˆH, respectively. 19 Let us consider an observable with operator ˆΩ,
which has the eigenvectors |a⟩and |b⟩deﬁned by:
19This should bring to mind, for instance, that the energy of a photon is given by E = ℏω, where ω
is the angular frequency.

The above usage of the wavefunction is for “pure states” (term deﬁned in section 2.6).
Now, instead of letting the quantum system evolve continuous from t = 0 to
t = 2τ, let us introduce a non-selective measurement at t = τ. How will this aﬀect
the probability of measuring a at t = 2τ? We will start with the same |ψ(0)⟩. We
will, however, use the density operator formulism to describe the system (see section
2.6) instead of strictly using only the ‘pure’ wavefunction. This is because we have
here what is called a “mixed state”. When we take the measurement at t = τ, the
original system given by (91) collapses, but we do not know whether it collapses into
|a⟩or |b⟩, as we do not ‘read out’ or record what the collapse leads to. We can use
(26) to write down:
ˆρ(τ) = pa(τ) |a⟩⟨a| + pb(τ) |b⟩⟨b| ,
(97)
where pa(τ) and pb(τ) are the probabilistic weights to the ‘statistical mixture’ of
possible states |a⟩and |b⟩of the system. The factor pa(τ) refers to the probability
that we observe a at t = τ (and hence the system collapsed to |a⟩) and the term pb(τ)
refers to the probability that we observe b at t = τ (and hence the system collapsed to
|b⟩). Since we are ignorant of which way the wavefunction collapses, the probabilities
became weights of likelihood in (97).
We calculate what the factors pa(τ) and pb(τ) are in a similar fashion to calculat-
ing (96):
pa(τ) = ⟨ψ(τ)|a⟩⟨a|ψ(τ)⟩=

The density operator therefore at t = 2τ can be represented as the following using
the above expressions:
ˆρ(2τ) = pa(τ) |ψa(2τ)⟩⟨ψa(2τ)| + pb(τ) |ψb(2τ)⟩⟨ψb(2τ)|
(104)
And we can use this to evaluate the probability of measuring a by using (27):
57

P(a) = Tr[ˆρ(2τ) |a⟩⟨a|] = ⟨a| ˆρ(2τ) |a⟩⟨a|a⟩+ ⟨b| ˆρ(2τ) |a⟩⟨a|b⟩.
Remember that ⟨a|b⟩= 0 and ⟨a|a⟩= 1, so:
P(a) = ⟨a| ˆρ(2τ) |a⟩.
Plugging in (104) we get:
P(a) = pa(τ) ⟨a|ψa(2τ)⟩⟨ψa(2τ)|a⟩+ pb(τ) ⟨a|ψb(2τ)⟩⟨ψb(2τ)|a⟩.
(105)
And now we can substitute the expressions (102), (103), (98), and (99) to get after
some algebra our ﬁnal expression:

(106)
Obviously, comparing (96) with (106) shows that they are two diﬀerent equations.
This shows us that in the quantum case making a non-selective measurement will
change the outcome of a later measurement. A non-selective measurement will mod-
ify the probability of outcome at a later point in time t.
So far, what we looked at is an abstract example to demonstrate non-selective
measurements in QM. Let us look at a more concrete example in QM, and then ﬁgure
out what the implications are for KvNM (following Mauro 2003). Starting oﬀ, let us
measure the probability of a quantum particle’s position from t = 0 to t = τ.
This will be given by (26) except we are no longer dealing with a discrete case.
Since position is continuous, we replace the summation sign with an integral (as an
integral is simply continuous summation of inﬁnitely small things). We start with a
pure state with wavefunction |ψ(0)⟩at t = 0. The probability density ρ (not to be
confused with the density matrix) of observing q at time t = τ will be given by
58

ρ(q, τ) = Tr[ˆρ(τ) |q⟩⟨q|] = |ψ(q, τ)|2,
(107)
where ˆρ(τ) = |ψ(τ)⟩⟨ψ(τ)| (pure state density matrix).
Let us say that we make a non-selective measurement immediately after t = 0,
which we will represent as time t = 0+. The pure state density matrix gets replaced
with a mixed density matrix. We utilize a continuous version of (26) to write the
density matrix
ˆρ(0+) =
ˆ
dq0|ψ(q0, 0)|2 |q0⟩⟨q0| .
To represent a state of the system immediately before t = 0, we can write time t = 0−
and say that:
ˆρ(0−) = |ψ(0−)⟩⟨ψ(0−)|
The system goes from ˆρ(0−) to ˆρ(0+) as a non-selective measurement is made at
t = 0.
In QM, the measurement right before and the measurement right after will ob-
serve the same thing (Mauro 2003). You can convince yourself of this by computing
the following:
ρ(q, 0−) = Tr[ˆρ(0−) |q⟩⟨q|] = ψ∗(q, 0)ψ(q, 0)
ρ(q, 0+) = Tr[ˆρ(0+) |q⟩⟨q|]
Tr[ˆρ(0+)]
= ψ∗(q, 0)ψ(q, 0)
Remember that the denominator, Tr[ˆρ(0+)], just represents the normalization condi-
tion (described in section 2.6). We can evolve ψ∗(q, 0)ψ(q, 0) to see that in the long
term the non-selective measurement does aﬀect the quantum system, just like in the
above worked out example (Mauro 2003). The probability density will be the same
instantaneously right before and right after measurement, but will alter in the long
run in QM.
59

Under KvNM, however, we can observe some diﬀerences arise. If we start with
a pure state again
ˆρ(0−) = |ψ(0−)⟩⟨ψ(0−)| ,
and conduct no measurements, we will have the KvN wavefunction evolve to
ρ(q, p, τ) = Tr[ˆρ(τ) |q, p⟩⟨q, p|] = |ψ(q, p, τ)|2,
(108)
similarly to the quantum case (107). Also like the quantum case, in KvNM measuring
the probability density right before and after will not alter the distribution:
Tr[ˆρ(0−) |q, p⟩⟨q, p|]
Tr[ˆρ(0−)]
= Tr[ˆρ(0+) |q, p⟩⟨q, p|]
Tr[ˆρ(0+)]
However, a non-selective measurement can be shown to leave the KvN wavefunction
unaltered, whereas a quantum wavefunction will be changed due to the non-selective
measurement .
ρ(0+) =
ˆ
dq0dp0|ψ(q0, p0, 0)|2 |q0, p0⟩⟨q0, p0| .
The above probability density, taken right after the measurement, can be shown to
naturally evolve into (108), as if no measurement has taken place (Mauro 2003).
There is one ﬁnal similarity worth mentioning between QM and KvNM. Under
QM, when a measurement is taken for position q, it aﬀects the outcome of the distri-
bution of p. Perhaps, this is not surprising, considering the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle. Under KvNM, a measurement taken for (q, p) will alter the statistical dis-
tribution of the variable λ (Mauro 2003). This should also not be surprising because,
as we discussed in section 5.2, there exists a classical uncertainty relationship be-
tween p and λ. The eﬀects of QM are still present in KvNM therefore, if we replace
q with (q, p) and p with λ.

5.4
The Double Slit Experiment
The Double Slit Experiment is at the center of Quantum Theory. QM has photons,
electrons, neutrons, and other quanta going through two tiny slits and forming an
interference pattern on the other side. Even if we send one particle at a time through
the double slit, the particle build up on the other side will reﬂect an interference
pattern. Even if the particle does not seem to interfere with any other particle, it still
is part of an interference pattern. This shows that the interference patterns are due to
something more fundamental in nature. 20
The wavefunction mathematically describes this strange behavior of elementary
particles, even though the exact interpretation of the wavefunction is not known.
Feynman believed that the strange behavior must lie in the complex nature of the
wavefunction (Mauro 2003). KvNM also contains complex wavefunctions in Hilbert
Space, so we might logically ask the obvious question: if KvNM has complex wave-
functions, will it successfully preserve our knowledge of CM, without interference
patterns arising? Here we will test the outcome of complex wavefunctions in classical
phase space. This analysis is based on the work of (Mauro 2003).
The double slit experiment is set up in Figure 1 above. The y axis is aligned
parallel to the direction of travel. The x axis will be the coordinate parallel to the
back wall where the interference is supposed to occur for the quantum case. In the
middle, at y = yM you have the wall with the two slits. At y = yF you have the wall
where interference occurs in the quantum case.
Under KvNM, we should expect no interference build up at the backwall at y =
yR. Under QM (and in reality), we want there to be an interference build up at the
backwall. We will start with analyzing the quantum case, and how it works. We want
a gaussian wave emerge from y = 0 and travel right until it hits the double slit wall.
Some of the wavefunction will travel through the two slits and eventually interfere at
y = yR if the system behaves quantum.
20Interestingly, if you cover up on of the two slits, you will recover particle travelling in straight
trajectories without any interference pattern, just as in CM. This makes the relationship between CM
and QM even more bizarre.
61

A gaussian function has the following form:
f(u) =
1
√
2πσ2e−(u−µ)2/2σ2
(109)
where µ is the average value µ = ⟨u⟩and σ is the standard deviation, given by
σ =
p
⟨u2⟩−⟨u⟩2.
Recalling the form of a quantum wavefunction (3), we can make it a gaussian
wavefunction by setting R equal to (109) with a generic renormalization constant
N.21 Let µ = 0 in order to center the wavefunction of the double slit experiment.

Note that for this wavefunction, S = 0, however. This is obvious when you consider

the leftmost wall is t = 0, the Action at the leftmost wall would be:
S =

We will utilize a very special trick in order to evaluate the above expression. Since
21In order to keep things nice and streamlined, the constant in front of (109) will simply be absorbed
into the Renormalization Constant.
62

we are dealing with a free particle, there are no potentials, or V (x, y) = 0 (hence no
forces or accelerations). Because of this, we do not have to use the full, intimidating
form of the Feynman Kernel (57). In this semiclassical treatment there is no acceler-
ation of the quantum particle in the y direction, and so the Kernel can be written in a
much simpler form.
Instead of taking on the form (57), it will instead have the form (56). This is
because we can treat the ﬁnal position of the wavefunction as qj+1 and the initial
position as qj if there is no acceleration. The term qj+1−qj simply becomes one large
step instead of a miniscule step as before. This is analogous to how in kinematics,
when there is no acceleration, the formula for instantaneous velocity is v = ∆x/∆t,
even though in every other case the formula gives you average velocity (as it is a slope
formula). You can also think of this simpliﬁcation as taking (57) and setting N = 1
(one large step due to no acceleration). Please note that this is not an approximation,
but this will give us an exact expression.
Our Kernel K (not to be confused with the Koopman Generator) is therefore:

to 0 and treating t and x(t) as constants, we can evaluate the integral. First, we will
pull out all constants and absorb them into N, the renormalization constant (recall
the renormalization condition described in section 2.3). Then we do the following
algebraic manipulations, in preparation to evaluating the integral itself:

The above wavefunction ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩= ψ(x, t) is true for anytime 0 < t ≤tM, where
tM is the time to reach the middle barrier with the two slits. This is because the above
wavefunction is that of a free particle, and once it encounters a barrier (or potential),
the particle is obviously no longer free.
Next, since the expression ψ(x, tM) gives you the quantum wavefunction at the
double slits, we have to take into consideration the portion of the wavefunction that
64

goes through the double slits. To describe the wavefunction going through the double
slit we will utilize step functions. The step functions will closely model the fact that
the wavefunction that hits the middle wall and stops will not be important in creating
any eﬀects on the other side of the wall. Only the wavefunction that goes through the
two slits will be important in creating the diﬀraction pattern on the other side (Shankar
1988; Mauro 2003). The step function, also called the θ-Heaveside function, is given
by:
H(x) =





1
x > 0
0
x ≤0
(112)
Each slit has a width of 2δ. The ﬁrst slit has width ∆1 = (xA −δ, xA + δ) and the
second slit has spans ∆2 = (−xA −δ, −xA + δ) (following the notation of Mauro
2003).
Then, the wavefunction right after the two slits can be written as
ψ(x, tM+dt) = Nψ(x, tM)[C1(x)+C2(x)] = N exp

−1

mx2

[C1(x)+C2(x)]
(113)
where the following functions can be deﬁned:
C1(x) = H(x −xA + δ) −H(x −xA −δ)
(114)
C2(x) = H(x + xA + δ) −H(x + xA −δ)
(115)
This is done in order to ﬁlter out the eﬀects of the wavefunction that actually goes
through the slits. We do not care for the portion of the wavefunction that does not go
through the double slit. They will produce no eﬀects. The above equations make cer-
tain that only the wavefunction that goes through slits ∆1 and ∆2 will be studied. The
N in (113) is a renormalization constant, so that
´
dxψ∗ψ = 1 (the renormalization
condition described in section 2.3).
Using our Kernel for the free particle again, we will evaluate the wavefunction
65

using the path integral for the region after the two slits. We again utilize (111). Notice
that the initial wavefunction ψ(x0, 0) in that equation starts at time zero, so we will
need to adjust the time at the double slit wall so that it is set to zero. We can do
this by substituting the variable t in the Kernel (111) with t −tM. This can be done
because time has the unique property that any point can be arbitrarily set to t = 0,
and by doing this swap we eﬀectively set the time at the middle wall equal to zero
(starts at tM and evolves from there). So the integral we need to evaluate will have
the following form:
⟨x|ψ(t)⟩= N

You can consider each of the two integrals to represent an independent wavefunction,
so that you can rewrite the whole expression as
⟨x|ψ(t)⟩= N[ψ1(x) + ψ2(x)]
You can think of ψ1 as being the wavefunction coming out of ∆1 and ψ2 as the wave-
function associated with ∆2.
The equation (117) shows us that the phases of the two wavefunctions ψ1 and ψ2
are out of phase. You can see this because the integration is over two diﬀerent inter-
66

vals, so the two phases will turn out diﬀerent. This is signiﬁcant, because wavefunc-
tions out of phase is characteristic of interference. When two wavefunctions with
diﬀerent phases overlap, they form the characteristic interference pattern (Shankar
1988; Mauro 2003).
If we want the probability of ﬁnding a particle at the rightmost wall (the inter-
ference wall), we need to know the wavefunction ⟨x|ψ(t)⟩at the rightmost wall. If
it takes time tR to reach this wall, that wavefunction can be simply represented as
⟨x|ψ(tR)⟩= ψ(x, tR) (equivalent to taking (117) and plugging in t = tR). Then,
according to the postulates of section 2.5, we just have to apply the Born Rule to ﬁnd
the probability density as a function of x:
ρ(x, t = tR) = ψ(x, tR)∗ψ(x, tR) = ⟨ψ(tR)|x⟩⟨x|ψ(tR)⟩=
= ψ1(x, tR)∗ψ1(x, tR)+ψ2(x, tR)∗ψ2(x, tR)+ψ1(x, tR)∗ψ2(x, tR)+ψ2(x, tR)∗ψ1(x, tR)
The last two terms are not identically zero (Mauro 2003). If we plot ρ vs x, we will
get the typical interference pattern we expected, as seen in Figure 2b.
This, of course, comes as no surprise. We are still dealing with quantum theory.
Following the same steps, though, will we get the same results with KvNM? We will
follow a similar series of steps to evaluate classical KvN theory.
For the KvNM case, we will use a double gaussian function because we are mak-
ing considerations with both the position and momentum (KvNM is a phase space
theory). A double gaussian (a gaussian in x and y coordinates; see Figure 3b) takes
on the mathematical form:
f(u, v) =
1
√πσuσv
e−(u−µu)2/2σu2e−(v−µv)2/2σv2
(118)
We are interested in the interference pattern that lies along the x direction. Taking
the KvN wavefunction ψ(x, px, t) = R(x, px, t)eiG(x,px,t) (like in section 5.1) and
plugging in (118) for R at t = 0 we will have
67

ψ(x, px, t = 0) =

(119)
Please note here that σp refers to the momentum in the x direction. Following the Path
Integral Formulism, in order to know the know the wavefunction ψ at some later time
t we will need to utilize the Kernel. For this situation, the travelling classical particle
is free of any potential V (x, y), so we will need the free particle wavefunction. As
V (x, y) = 0, there will be no derivatives of the potential. We can take the results (75)
and (76) to get a straightforward and concise Kernel, which will make the calculation
we are about to do simple.
We can take (75) and rewrite it in the following way (dropping the constant 2π,
as it can be normalized away, and replacing q with the desired variable x):
δ
∆t
m (pj −mxj+1 −xj
∆t
)


pj∆t

−xj+1 + xj

In the continuum limit, we can just simply write this as:
= δ
p0t
m + x0 −x

where x0 is the initial position of the particle, p0x is the initial momentum, and m is
the mass as before. This comes straight from elementary kinematics, as since there
is no potential, the derivative of the potential must be 0, so there is no acceleration:
Fx = −∂V
∂x = max ⇒ax = 0
x(t) = x0 + v0xt + 1
2axt2 ⇒x(t) = x0 + v0xt = x0 + p0xt
m
Using the momentum relation px = mvx on the last step. In other words, the Dirac
delta functional is enforcing classical position evolution, x(t).

The same can be done with (76) to get:

∆tδ

In the continuum limit remembering the direction is in x:

This makes sense, considering that there are no forces present (because potential
is zero), and hence the momentum should be constant. This Dirac delta functional
enforces classical momentum conservation.
The Kernel K can therefore be succinctly represented as
K = δ

px −p0x

(120)
And plugging this Kernel into the original equation (68) shows us that indeed it pro-
vides us with the correct result that we desire, forcing classical evolution of the KvN
wavefunction:

utilizing the property (19) . This statement checks out, as we know that ⟨x, p|ψ(t)⟩=
ψ(x, p, t).
Returning to (119), we will evaluate the same integral utilizing the Kernel. By
equation (68), the evolution of the wavefunction from its original state when t = 0 is
given by
⟨x, px|ψ(t)⟩=

Note that the above is strictly in terms of the position and momentum in the x direc-
tion. The above equation is true at least until it hits the middle wall with the slits,
because up until that point the wavefunction is that of a free particle. Using geomet-
ric considerations, we can ﬁgure out the wavefunction at the double slit wall. Since
there is no acceleration in the direction of travel (as −∂V/∂y = 0), we know from
kinematics:
vy = p0y
m = ∆y
∆t = yf −y0
tf −t0
Under the assumption that y(0) = 0 we can write:
yM
t
= p0y
m ⇒tM = yMm
p0y
,
(122)
where tM is the time to the double slit wall. We can substitute this value into (121)
to know what is the classical wavefunction at that point in time.
Then, the wavefunction right after the two slits can be written as
ψ(x, px, tM + dt) = Nψ(x, px, tM)[C1(x) + C2(x)]
(123)
Utilizing, as before, the functions (114) and (115) we had deﬁned in the quantum
picture above. This is done in order to ﬁlter out the eﬀects of the wavefunction that
actually goes through the slits. We do not care for the portion of the wavefunction
that does not go through the double slit. They will produce no eﬀects. The above
equations make certain that only the wavefunction that goes through slits ∆1 and ∆2
will be studied. The N in (123) is a renormalization constant, similar to before, so
that
´
dx dpxψ∗ψ = 1 (the renormalization condition for the KvN wavefunction.)
Using our Kernel for the free particle again, we will evaluate the wavefunction
70

using the path integral for the region after the two slits. We again utilize (68). Notice
that the initial wavefunction ψ(q0, p0, 0) in that equation starts at time zero, so we
will need to adjust the time at the double slit wall so that it is set to zero. We can do
this by substituting the variable t in the Kernel (120) with t −tM. This can be done
because time has the unique property that any point can be arbitrarily set to t = 0, and
by doing this swap we eﬀectively set the time at the middle wall equal to zero (starts
at tM and evolves from there). So the integral we need to evaluate has the following

Similar to (122), under geometric considerations one can show that the time to the
back wall is tR = myR/p0y, and so we can substitute this and (122) into the above
expression to get the expression for the wavefunction at the back wall (wall where we
should see the interference pattern emerge in QM).
We want to know the probability distribution for ﬁnding a particle at coordinate
x at this back wall (Mauro 2003). We have no need of the momentum information,
as the interference pattern is a shape that appears in space. So what we can do is get
the probability distribution in terms of x is the following:
P(x) =
ˆ ∞
−∞
dpx|ψ(x, px, tR−tM)|2 =

dpx ⟨ψ(tR −tM)|x, px⟩⟨x, px|ψ(tR −tM)⟩

The ﬁrst integral in the above expression is the probability at x if only the ﬁrst slit
∆1 was opened and the second slit ∆2 was closed, and the second integral in the
above expression is the probability at x if only the second slit ∆2was opened and
the ﬁrst slit ∆1 was closed. This can be seen from how C1 ﬁlters out any portion
of the wavefunction that does not go through ∆1 and C2 ﬁlters out any portion of
the wavefunction that does not go through ∆2. This means that the total probability
distribution is the sum of the probability distribution of each slit, which is exactly
what you would expect for particle instead of wave behavior (no interference eﬀects).
Notice also that the phase of the wavefunction has completely disappeared from
the above equation. You will see this is important, because for interference eﬀects
we will want the phase to play an active role. Waves must be out of phase in order
to produce interference eﬀects, not have the phase cancel each other out like in the
above equations.
If you graph the above function, you will see that indeed no interference fringes
were produced (see Figure 2a). Koopman wavefunctions therefore successfully pre-
dict the behavior of classical particles. Despite their complex nature in a Hilbert
space, they do no produce any interference eﬀects. All the interference eﬀects com-
pletely disappear. It shows how wavefunctions can describe classical physics.

Miscellaneous KvN Topics of Interest
6.1
Operational Dynamic Modeling
The history of physics is full of failed models, models that did not stand the test of
time. Physics is often carried out in a trial and error fashion, a process that can be
repetitive, messy, and slow. This raises the question if discovery and model building
in physics can be optimized, for the sake of speeding up the progress of discovery.
One such optimization model is called Operation Dynamical Modeling (ODM)
and utilizes KvNM as an essential ingredient (Bondar et al. 2012). The two main
pillars of modern physics is QM and CM. 22 Since we have seen that both QM and
CM must obey the Ehrenfest Theorems, any particular model must conform to either
QM or CM to the best of our knowledge, and if it falls outside either pillar, the model is
quite likely false. If repeated measurements inﬂuence the outcome of the experiment,
one knows that there must be a noncommutative algebra involved (i.e., there must
be a nonzero commutator involved, like in QM.) If repeated measurements do not
generally alter the outcome of the experiment in the fashion of QM, you can assume
a commutator of 0 between all variables involved.
Since the Ehrenfest Theorems deal with dynamical weighted averages (expecta-
tion values), this is a statistical test of diﬀerent models. If a model does not obey
the Ehrenfest Theorems, it is quite likely to be false, and progress can be saved by
either ﬁxing the model so that it is inline with the fundamental Ehrenfest Theorems
or scrapping the model.
Not only does ODM allow quantum and classical physics, it also explains the
nexus of the two. Semi-classical systems are incorporated into ODM, as they must
also obey the Ehrenfest Theorems. By construction, one could create a commutator
that encompasses both the classical and quantum worlds, such as [ˆq, ˆp] = iℏκ where
κ is a constant that lies between 0 (classical world) and 1 (purely quantum world).
By taking the limit of κ goes to 0, one should be able to recover either CM.
22Note, General Relativity and Special Relativity are here considered to be part of CM.
74

This melding, in fact, results in the derivation of the semi-classical Wigner quasiprob-
ability distribution. This function is known to accurately describe the interface be-
tween the quantum world and the classical world. As the Schr¨odinger equation is
generally written in terms of conﬁguration space, the Wigner quasiprobability dis-
tribution is important because it recasts QM into a phase space theory. The Wigner
function has a few odd properties, including the fact that it can take on negative prob-
abilities, but thanks to ODM some light has been shed to the reasons why this might
be the case (as we will discuss later.)
We will begin with Stone’s Theorem again like we did in section 3, i.e. i ∂
∂t |ψ⟩=
ˆH |ψ⟩, and try to create an operator ˆHQC which will encompass both the classical and
quantum worlds using our newly constructed commutator [ˆq, ˆp] = iℏκ, 0 ≤κ ≤1.
We must have a uniﬁed quantum-classical algebra which gives us the Koopman-
von Neumann Algebra (43) when κ = 0 and a quantum algebra for κ = 1. We
desire:
lim
κ→0 ˆqQC = ˆqc
lim
κ→0 ˆpQC = ˆpc
lim
κ→0
ˆHQC = ℏˆK
In order to reﬂect the KvN Algebra, Bondar et al. 2013 proposed the following uniﬁed
Classical-Quantum Algebra:
[ˆqQC, ˆθQC] = [ˆpQC, ˆλQC] = i
(125)
All other commutators will equal 0. For the uniﬁed dynamics, we ﬁrst begin with the
Ehrenfest Theorems (equations (36) and (37) for reference) as before:
d
dt⟨q⟩= d
dt ⟨ψ(t)| ˆqQC |ψ(t)⟩= 1
m⟨p⟩= 1
m ⟨ψ(t)| ˆpQC |ψ(t)⟩
d
dt⟨p⟩= d
dt ⟨ψ(t)| ˆpQC |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨−V ′(q)⟩= ⟨ψ(t)| −V ′(ˆqQC) |ψ(t)⟩
75

Following the same series of steps as in section 3, we will obtain the diﬀerential
equations:

κ
h ˆp2
QC
2m + V (ˆqQC)
i
+ F(ˆpQC −ℏκˆθQC, ˆqQC + ℏκˆλQC)
where the function F is a function undetectable to experiment because one can show
that for any observable A, you have [ ˆF, ˆA] = 0 (Bondar et al. 2012).
The quantum operators can be constructed from classical ones, so Bondar et al.
2012 propose that
ˆqQC = ˆqc −ℏκ
ˆλc
2
ˆpQC = ˆpc + ℏκ
ˆθc
2
ˆθQC = ˆθc
ˆλQC = ˆλc
It is clear that the above expressions have a nice, smooth classical limit as κ →0.
All the variables operators become classical operators in that limit.
To make the limit smooth as you go from the quantum Hamiltonian ˆH to ℏˆK as
κ goes from 1 to 0, Bondar et al. 2012 dervied:
ˆHQC = 1
κ[ ˆp2
QC
2m + V (ˆqQC)] −
1
2mκ(ˆpQC −ℏκˆθQC)2 −1
κV (ˆqQC + ℏκˆλQC) (126)
Equivalently, you can write by plugging in the quantum-classical operators:
76

ˆHQC = ℏ
m ˆpcˆθc + 1
κV (ˆqc −ℏκ
2
ˆλc) −1
κV (ˆqc + ℏκ
2
ˆλc)
The above expression can be shown to lead to the phase space formulation of QM, the
Wigner quasiprobability distribution. This derivation will be left for the next section.
The Wigner distribution is signiﬁcant because it is known to accurately model the
‘nexus’ between quantum and classical worlds (Bondar et al. 2012; Bondar et al.
2013). It also has a nice classical limit (Bondar et al. 2012; Bondar et al. 2013).
Independently deriving this distribution indicates that the Ehrenfest Theorems apply
at all times, including in the regime of quantum/classical boundary. ODM, therefore,
is a very successful melding of the two worlds.
ODM suggests that any physical theory will follow KvNM, QM, or the above
melding of the two. KvNM is fundamentally important because any novel classical
theory proposed must be consistent with it. We will see certain applications of ODM
and its successes in the pages that follow. Without KvNM, there would be no unifying
paradigm based in the Ehrenfest Theorems. ODM is a methodology that will pave
for more eﬃcient discovery in Physics.
6.2
Wigner Quasiprobability Distribution
The Wigner Quasiprobability Distribution connects our understanding of the quan-
tum wavefunction to phase space. It is an important area of study developed by Eu-
gen Wigner in 1932 and independently formulated by another eminent mathematical
physicist, Jos´e Enrique Moyal. The Wigner Distribution has a variety of applications,
from quantum optics to quantum computing (Bondar et al. 2013). It has one signiﬁ-
cantly odd feature though. This distribution allows for negative probabilities, which
is axiomatically impossible by mainstream probability theories (Bondar et al. 2013).
ODM sheds some light on this odd feature. The Wigner Distribution can be derived
from the uniﬁed dynamics of ODM, and we will proceed to do so below.
It is very simple to derive the Wigner quasiprobability distribution from ODM’s
77

uniﬁed dynamics. Again, we hark back to Stone’s Theorem, in order to try to ﬁgure
out the generator of motion:
iℏd
dt |ψ(t)κ⟩= ˆHQC |ψ(t)κ⟩
We will sandwich it from the left with |qc, λc⟩to get the λc, qc representation. Refer-
ring back to the rules for operators acting on vector kets, we can see that:
⟨q, λ| ˆqc |ψ(t)⟩= [⟨q, λ| ˆqc] |ψ(t)⟩= q ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)⟩
(127)
⟨q, λ| ˆλc |ψ(t)⟩= [⟨q, λ| ˆλc] |ψ(t)⟩= λ ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)⟩
(128)
where q and λ are the eigenvalues. From Theorem IV of Appendix A, we can say
that B = p, A = λ, κ = −1 (since [ˆλ, ˆp] = −i) 23 and keep in mind that the Classical
Commutator is [ˆqc, ˆpc] = 0. Therefore:
⟨q, λ| ˆpc |ψ(t)⟩= −i(−1) ∂
∂λ ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)⟩= i ∂
∂λ ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)⟩
(129)
There is no partial derivative with respect to q as the Classical Commutator between
ˆq and ˆp is 0. Theorem IV can also be applied in the situation where B = θ in order
to derive:
⟨q, λ| ˆθc |ψ(t)⟩= −i ∂
∂q ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)⟩
(130)
Now we create the actual ‘sandwich’ from Stone’s Theorem:
⟨q, λ| iℏd
dt |ψ(t)κ⟩= ⟨q, λ| [ ℏ
m ˆpcˆθc + 1
κV (ˆqc −ℏκ
2
ˆλc) −1
κV (ˆqc + ℏκ

m ˆpcˆθc |ψ(t)κ⟩+ ⟨q, λ| 1
κV (ˆqc −ℏκ
2
ˆλc) |ψ(t)κ⟩+
23This is because [ˆλ, ˆp] = −[ˆp, ˆλ] and as indicated earlier, [ˆp, ˆλ] = i.
78

−⟨q, λ| 1
κV (ˆqc + ℏκ
2
ˆλc) |ψ(t)κ⟩
Utilizing the previous results for Theorem I (see footnote 13), we can see:
iℏd
dt ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩= ℏ
m ⟨q, λ| ˆpcˆθc |ψ(t)κ⟩+1
κV (q−ℏκ
2 λ) ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩−1
κV (q+ℏκ
2 λ) ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩
Finally utilizing the results from Theorem IV above:
iℏd
dt ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩= −i2 ℏ
m
∂2
∂λ∂q ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩+ 1
κV (q −ℏκ
2 λ) ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩+
−1
κV (q + ℏκ
2 λ) ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩
Let us move all the terms to the left hand side of the equation, so that the left hand
side equals 0 pm the right hand side. Introducing two new variables, u = q −ℏκλ/2
and v = q + ℏκλ/2, we will rewrite the whole equation so it has a prettier form. To
eliminate the double partial derivative, we can take the following steps:
u −v = q −ℏκλ
2
−q −ℏκλ
2
= −ℏκλ
u + v = q −ℏκλ
2
+ q + ℏκλ
2
= 2q
Therefore the partial derivative can be rewritten:
∂2
∂λ∂q =
∂2
∂(u−v
−ℏκ)∂(u+v
2 ) = −2ℏκ
∂2
∂(u −v)∂(u + v) = −2ℏκ
h ∂2
∂u2 −∂2
∂v2

Recasting the entire equation in terms of u and v:

2m
 ∂2
∂u2 −∂2
∂v2

−V (u) + V (v)
i
⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩= 0
(131)
Here, ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩is equal to the density matrix ρκ(u, v, t) up to a constant of pro-
79

portionality C, i.e., ρκ(u, v, t) = C ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩.
We can transition to q, p representation to derive the Wigner distribution from the
above using Theorem II with A = (q, λ):
⟨q, p|ψ(t)κ⟩= ⟨q, p| I |ψ(t)κ⟩=
ˆ
dλ ⟨q, p|q, λ⟩⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩
Note that we do not integrate over q due to the commutator relationships [ˆq, ˆq] =
[ˆqc, ˆpc] = 0, whereas [ˆpc, ˆλc] = i. Since [ˆq, ˆq] = [ˆqc, ˆpc] = 0 it makes no sense
to integrate over q, as might be initially implied by looking at the expressions akin
to (31). Since the other commutator is nonzero, we will retain integration over λ,
however. We know that ρκ(u, v, t) = C ⟨q, λ|ψ(t)κ⟩, so we will plug that in.
The question now is to ﬁgure out what ⟨q, p|q, λ⟩is. We will utilize Theorem IV
and the commutator relationships in order to deduce this. Since [ˆq, ˆq] = [ˆqc, ˆpc] = 0,
solving this expression is equivalent to solving ⟨p|λ⟩, as the other terms commute
(i.e., the commutator of their operators is equal to 0) and are therefore irrelevant to
this problem. By Theorem IV, we set A = p, B = λ, and κ = 1. We know that this
expression is therefore
⟨q, p|q, λ⟩= ⟨p|λ⟩=
1
√
2πeipλ
Putting it all together:
⟨q, p|ψ(t)κ⟩=
ˆ
dλ C
√
2πρκ(q −ℏκλ
2 , q + ℏκλ
2 , t)eipλ
(132)
The above expression shows us that the wavefunction ⟨q, p|ψ(t)κ⟩is equal to the
Wigner quasi-probability distribution up to a constant of proportionality C. The
Wigner distribution is very accurate when it comes to describing the boundary of
Quantum and Classical (Bondar et al. 2012; Bondar et al. 2013), so this is no trivial
derivation.
What ODM reveals is that the Wigner “distribution” is therefore a type of wave-
function for a quantum particle at a point in classical phase space. The strange prop-
80

erty of having negative probabilities can by explained in the ODM framework as
being due to the fact that the Wigner “distribution” is not a distribution at all! It is a
wavefunction. Wavefunctions, unlike probability distributions, can take on negative
values (Bondar et al. 2013). The KvN wavefunction can have negative or imaginary
weights to it, whereas traditional Louiville theory gives only positive, real weights to
the same trajectories (Bondar et al. 2013).
It is worth to highlight one more interesting result of the above analysis. Although
not directly physically observable, the operators ˆθ and ˆλ can be indirectly observed
through the Wigner wavefunction. They are a critical ingredient as the so-called
‘Bopp Operators’.
6.3
Time Dependent Harmonic Oscillator
The Harominc Oscillator is one of the most thoroughly studied models in all of
physics. Its application arises in many situations. We are especially interested in
the Time Dependent Harmonic Oscillator, where factors like the mass or frequency
might change with time. Because of the common mathematical basis for QM and
KvNM, it should come to no surprise that common sets of tools can be used to in-
vestigate both. The Harmonic Oscillator is no exception. The operatorial tools to
investigate quantum oscillators can be used to explore classical (KvN) oscillators
and vise versa.
For a classical or quantum Time Dependent Harmonic Oscillator we need a quadratic
potential of the following form:
V (ˆq, t) = k(t) ˆq2
2
The above potential is modelled oﬀof the classical spring potential. An ideal block-
mass and spring system can undergo harmonic oscillation. The spring potential is
given by V = (1/2)kq2 with spring constant k and displacement q. Here, we add an
extra layer of complexity by making the spring constant time dependent. This is our
81

model potential for all Time Dependent Harmonic Oscillation, whether quantum or
classical.
In the quantum case, we would plug in the above expression for the potential term
into the Schr¨odinger equation to solve for the Quantum Oscillator. In the classical
case, we plug in the derivative of the above expression into the Koopman Generator
(45):
∂
∂ˆqV (ˆq, t) = ∂
∂ˆqk(t) ˆq2
2 = k(t)ˆq = V ′(ˆq)

h ˆpˆθ
m −V ′(ˆq)ˆλ
i
|ψ(t)⟩=
h ˆpˆθ
m −k(t)ˆλˆq
i
|ψ(t)⟩.
Similar to what we did before (50) in section 3, we can attack both sides with the bra
vector ⟨q, p| to get:
⟨q, p| i ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p|
h ˆpˆθ
m −k(t)ˆλˆq
i
|ψ(t)⟩,
i ∂
∂t ⟨q, p|ψ(t)⟩= ⟨q, p| ˆpˆθ
m |ψ(t)⟩−⟨q, p| k(t)ˆλˆq |ψ(t)⟩,
i ∂
∂tψ(q, p, t) =
h ˆpˆθ
m −k(t)ˆλˆq
i
ψ(q, p, t)
(133)
where we colloquially say that ˆq = q, ˆp = p, ˆλ = −i ∂
∂p, and ˆθ = −i ∂
∂q, just as we
derived in section 3. Notice as for the Path Integral (section 4.2), we choose to set
the constant C to zero in the Koopman Generator for simplicity’s sake.
One way to solve for the equations of motion of a Harmonic Oscillator is to use
Ermakov-Lewis invariants (Lewis Jr. 1967). If you have a Hamiltonian of the form
ˆH = 1
2[ˆp2 + Ω2(t)ˆq2],
where Ω(t) is an arbitrary function with time dependence, you can use the invariant
to write a transformation where the time dependent term Ω(t) completely disappears.
82

This makes solving the problem much simpler. Like it sounds, the Ermakov-Lewis
invariant ˆI is an operator that does not change (stays constant in time). The invariant
ˆI obeys the following rule for the quantum system (Lewis Jr. 1967; Lewis Jr. and
Riesenfeld 1968):
dˆI
dt = ∂ˆI
∂t + 1
iℏ[ˆI, ˆH] = 0.
(134)
ˆH is the generator of motion, usually the quantum Hamiltonian, but in the classical
case it will be the Koopman Generator. Based on the Koopman Algebra (43), Ramos-
Prieto et al. 2018 deduced the following expression for ˆI:
ˆI = α0ˆq2 + α1ˆθ2 + α2ˆp2 + α3ˆλ2 + α4ˆqˆp + α5ˆθˆλ
where all the αj are time dependent. This was a scientiﬁc guess basically, as there is
no simple way to derive this fact. Plugging the above expression into (134), we get:
∂α0
∂t ˆq2 + ∂α1
∂t
ˆθ2 + ∂α2
∂t ˆp2 + ∂α3

ˆλ2 + ∂α4
∂t ˆqˆp + ∂α5
∂t

iℏ[ˆI, ˆK] = 0

It must equal zero, but each of the operators we know is nonzero, so the only way
for this equation to be true is if all the coeﬃcients above equal zero. Setting all the
coeﬃcients equal to zero and solving the system of equations will lead you to the
dynamics of the (here classical) Harmonic Oscillator.
For instance, if we solve for α1 we will get the equation:

And if we deﬁne an arbitrary function called ρ(t) so that α1 = ρ2(t)
2 , we will have
d2ρ
dt2 + k(t)ρ = C/ρ3
which is an equation we call the Ermakov equation (Lewis Jr. 1967; Lewis Jr. and
Riesenfeld 1968). Using the Ermakov equation, all other coeﬃcients can be rewritten
so that the invariant has the following form:

Notice that the above classical Ermakov-Lewis invariant cannot be directly observed.
This is because operators like ˆθ and ˆλ are not directly tied to physically observable
quantities (Ramos-Prieto et al. 2018). Nevertheless, it serves as an important tool in
solving Harmonic Oscillation problems.

which for the quantum case transforms the time dependent problem described above
to a time independent problem (Lewis Jr. 1967; Lewis Jr. and Riesenfeld 1968) by
the following:
1
2[ˆp2 + ˆq2] = ˆTI ˆT †.
In the classical case, we can deﬁne the following two unitary transformations (Ramos-

We can deﬁne the new wavefunction Ψ(q, p, t) = ˆT2 ˆT1ψ(q, p, t) and we can rewrite
our equation of interest (133):

(142)
where the values of the operators are exactly the same as in (133). The original
wavefunction equation got transformed into a wavefunction equation without the time
dependent potential term in front of the position operator. This can be much more
easily solved to deduce the statistical motion of the classical particles.
Note that this method was originally used in the operatorial form for the Schr¨odinger
equation (Lewis Jr. 1967). We are able to successfully implement this procedure for
88

KvNM as well. If you graph the phase space diagrams for a selected k(t), you can
see that it is indeed the graph of an oscillator (Ramos-Prieto et al. 2018). KvNM
is successful at bridging methods that involve quantum-like operators with classical
physics.

Aharonov–Bohm Eﬀect
The Aharonov-Bohm Eﬀect is a surprising phenomena that emerges from the quan-
tum wavefunction interacting with the magnetic potential. In classical electromag-
netic theory, one can take the electric ⃗E and magnetic ⃗B ﬁelds and decompose them
into various derivatives of electric and magnetic potentials:
⃗E = −⃗∇φ,
⃗B = ⃗∇× ⃗A,
where φ is the electric scalar potential and ⃗A is the magnetic vector potential. Both
of these potentials have the unique property that they make ⃗E and ⃗B gauge invariant,
in other words, that a ‘shift’ χ will not produce diﬀerent magnetic or electric ﬁelds.
In other words, the new potentials ⃗A′ and φ′ deﬁned by
⃗A′ = ⃗A + ⃗∇χ,
and
φ′ = φ −∂χ
∂t ,
will produce the same magnetic and electric ﬁelds as ⃗A and φ. These potentials have
historically been seen as useful mathematical constructs with little physical bearing
on reality in themselves. The Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect soon put this assumption to the
test.
The Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect is a a quantum interference, much like that in Young’s
Double Slit Experiment, produced by the magnetic potential changing the phases of
89

the quantum wavefunctions. When diﬀerent wavefunctions with diﬀerence phases
meet, they interfere with themselves. The surprising thing is that the interference
pattern does not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B but directly on the magnetic potential
⃗A. In other words, if the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B = ⃗∇× ⃗A is zero but the potential is
nonzero, an eﬀect will still be observed. This suggests that the magnetic potential
⃗A is more fundamental than the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B, which have always been seen as
being on equal footing in classical theory.
Aharonov and Bohm described the theory behind the phenomena in 1959, but
the idea was not experimentally veriﬁed for the magnetic potential until after their
deaths. The experiment used a solenoid, which is the model we will use here for the
magnetic potential. Recall that a solenoid is a cylindrical device made of winding
wire which produces a magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid and zero magnetic ﬁeld
outside the solenoid.
The generic setup of the experiment for either type of potential is depicted in Fig-
ure 4. A coherent beam of electrons would be split into two branches, travel through
an electric or magnetic potential where ⃗E = ⃗0 or ⃗B = ⃗0, and the two branches would
then be recombined. Each branch’s wavefunction took a slightly diﬀerent path, so
when the two branches are recombined an interference pattern should emerge be-
cause of a phase diﬀerence acumulated along each path. This is a semiclassical way
to visualize the experiment (recall that in QM proper, the particle actually takes all
possible paths between source and sink in the allotted time.)
To understand mathematically how the phase shift happens, ﬁrst recall the polar
form of the wavefunction (3) and what the Action represents (51). We can write that:
ψ = R exp
 i
ℏ
ˆ t
0
T −V dt

.
(143)
The above wavefunction can be written for a region with no potential energy (free
particle case) as:
ψ0 = R exp
 i
ℏ
ˆ t


.
90

And so (143) can be rewritten in the generic case as:
ψ = ψ0 exp

−i
ℏ
ˆ t
0
V dt

.
For a wavefunction going through an electric potential, from CM we know we can
write that the potential energy is V = eφ, where e is the charge of the particle’s
wavefunction and φ is the scalar potential. And so the generic wavefunction can be
written as the following for the case with electric potential:
ψ = ψ0 exp

−ie
ℏ
ˆ t
0
φdt

.
(144)
The above formulas can be used to describe what should happen in the experiment in
the presence of the electric potential.
Refer to Figure 4. Starting oﬀ, the beam of coherent electrons has wavefunction
ψ0 in the absence of an external potential. It is split into two, and both branches travel
through a region of potential φ, so each wavefunction gains the form of (144). The
branching could be represented as ψ0
1 and ψ0
2 upon reaching the area with electric
potential at time t1. After some evolution they leave the potential at time t2, and they
are then recombined. The ﬁrst branch travelled along potential φ1 and the second
branch travelled along φ2, in this semiclassical picture. You can write the following
superposition for the ﬁnal wavefunction:
ψf = ψ1 + ψ2 = ψ0

where we deﬁne the phases
C1 = e

and
C2 = e
ˆ t2

φ2dt.
91

Since C1 and C2 are diﬀerent, we have gained a phase shift of (C1 −C2)/ℏ24 There
is absolutely no classical force ⃗F = e ⃗E exerted on the electrons as there is no elec-
tric ﬁeld, but a measurable eﬀect should still be produced on the electron’s behavior
(Aharonov and Bohm 1959).
A similar analysis can be done with the magnetic vector potential. Following
Aharonov and Bohm 1959, we can generalize (144) to include the magnetic potential.
In relativity, you can write the electromagnetic potential as the four vector Aµ =
(φ/c ⃗A) = (φ/c Ax Ay Az) where as before, φ is the electric potential and ⃗A is
the magnetic potential. The position four vector can be represented is xµ = (ct ⃗x) =
(ct x y z). Rewriting the position four vector as the diﬀerential dxµ, we can generalize
the potential integral to be:
e

Aµdxµ = e

(145)
The path of integration has to be closed in spacetime (Aharonov and Bohm 1959).
Let us assume that the variable t is a constant in order to understand how interference
could arise strictly from the magnetic potential. The above integral suggests that we
will expect the following phase shift to hold true:
(C1 −C2)/ℏ= −e
cℏ

⃗A · d⃗x
We can set up a similar situation as to before.
Starting oﬀ, the beam of electrons has wavefunction ψ0 in the absence of an ex-
ternal magnetic potential. It is split into two, and both branches travel through a
region of potential ⃗A. Each wavefunction gains the form of (144) except we re-

24This comes straight from the Euler formula. Recall that:

the same, then you will have phase diﬀerence (C1 −C2)/ℏ= (e/cℏ)
´ ⃗A · d⃗x in the
end (Aharonov and Bohm 1959). Note that this is true even if the magnetic force
⃗F = q⃗v × ⃗B is zero because ⃗B = ⃗0. This is a purely quantum eﬀect.
The electric Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect described above has been theorized, but no
experimental data exists for it as of yet. We will focus on the magnetic potential there-
fore. No further space will be dedicated to the electric potential, but all considerations
from here on out will be framed in the context of the magnetic potential.
One may ask the obvious question, in the descriptions above, if all possible paths
are taken in the Path Integral, would not some paths go through the magnetic ﬁeld,
explaining the outcome of the experiment? Since the Feynman Path Integral deﬁnes
a set starting point and endpoint in a set time period, it is actually possible to show
that you can set up a barrier (described in Aharonov and Bohm 1959) so that no
wavefunction directly interacts with the inside of the solenoid in the magnetic case.
93

The changes we see, therefore, must be due to the nonzero magnetic potential instead
of the magnetic ﬁeld itself.
KvNM, having the mathematical form of quantum theory, might be one of the
best tools to show that the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect does not exist in CM (Mauro 2003).
This is a purely quantum phenomenon. Interference is not something expected in the
domain of CM, but is expected under QM. This can be traced to the behavior of the
generator of motion, the quantum Hamiltonian, having the following form under QM
in the presence of the magnetic potential for a free particle:
ˆH =
1
2m

ˆp −e
c
⃗A
2
In the presence of the magnetic potential, the free particle Hamiltonian has the ˆp
operator replaced with ˆp −(e/c) ⃗A. This is described as a minimal coupling rule
(Gozzi and Mauro 2002). If KvNM describes CM precisely, we should expect that
the generator of motion, the Koopman Generator (45), will not be aﬀected by the
magnetic potential even if we treat it mathematically in the exact same ways as we
treat the quantum Hamiltonian. In the following pages, we will put this to the test.
First, imagine two cylinders, one within the other (following Gozzi and Mauro
2002; Mauro 2003). Let them be inﬁnite in height. The smaller cylinder on the
inside will represent the solenoid which houses a magnetic ﬁeld. The outside of the
solenoid (area inside the larger cylinder but outside of the smaller cylinder) will have
no magnetic ﬁeld, but there will be a magnetic potential. Since we are dealing with
cylinders, it would be useful to rewrite the generators of motion in terms of cylindrical
coordinates. The conversion of cartesian to cylindrical coordinates is given by:
x = r cos(θ),
y = r sin(θ),
and
z = z,
(147)
94

where r is the distance from the z axis and θ is the angle in the xy plane.
With this notation, the quantum Hamiltonian for a free particle can be written:
ˆH = −ℏ2

This is now in cylindrical coordinates. The eigenvalue problem we want to solve is:
ˆHψ(r, θ, z) = Eψ(r, θ, z).
where E are the energy eigenvalues. The above expression is often termed the time
independent Schr¨odinger equation, as it uses the quantum Hamiltonian to extract en-
ergy values with no explicit time derivative.
Since the operators ∂/∂θ and ∂/∂z commute with the above form of ˆH, we can
choose solutions of the form (Gozzi and Mauro 2002):
ψ(r, θ, z) = 1
2π exp
ip0

exp[inθ]R(r),
(148)
where p0
z is a constant and n is an integer. Plugging in this wavefunction into the

Bessel Functions are a class of functions that govern cylindrical harmonics.
If you turn on the magnetic potential, we will now have to solve
ˆHAψ(r, θ, z)A = EAψ(r, θ, z)A.
In order to achieve this, we have the following minimal coupling rule in cylindrical

where Φ is the ﬂux (constant) through an area perpendicular to the axis of the smaller
cylinder. This area will be larger than the smaller cylinder’s cross-section. Notice
that ˆpθ is not present in the wavefunction, so the form of (148) will remain unaltered.
The energy values in the presence of the magnetic potential, as you will see, will be
diﬀerent.
As before, substituting (148) into the magnetic potential version of the time inde-
pendent Schr¨odinger equation will give you the following Bessel function

that the presence of the magnetic potential shifts the function’s behavior. For the
quantum case, the behavior of the system is impacted by the presence of the vector
potential.
Now we will do the same procedure for ˆL as the generator of motion (33). For
the free particle in 3 dimensions, we know that
ˆL = −ipx

based oﬀof (33). Just as in the quantum case, we want this to be in cylindrical coor-
dinates. We will therefore need to convert the cartesian momenta px, py, and pz into
pr, pθ, and pz. The latter are the canonical momenta, which can be calculated directly
from the Lagrangian L.25 As before, any cartesian coordinates can be converted to
25Do not confuse the Lagrangian L with the operator ˆL. These are two diﬀerent mathematical
entities.
96

cylindrical coordinates via (147), which we will make use of.
To start oﬀ, we write down the Lagrangian of motion. Recall from section 4.1,
the Lagrangian is just the kinetic energy minus the potential energy, L = T −V .
Since the potential is zero, the Lagrangian is just equal to the total kinetic energy, so
that
L = T = 1
2m( ˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2),
(150)
where we use the standard dot notation, so that any variable γ has a time derivative
˙γ = dγ/dt. We can take time derivatives of (147) to get:
x = r cos(θ) ⇒˙x = ˙r cos(θ) −r sin(θ) ˙θ,
y = r sin(θ) ⇒˙y = ˙r sin(θ) + r cos(θ) ˙θ,
with the z coordinate unaﬀected. Plugging these terms into (150), we get our La-
grangian in cylindrical coordinates:
L = 1
2m ˙r2 + 1
2mr2 ˙θ2 + 1
2m ˙z2
Recalling from Lagrangian Dynamics that the canonical momentum associated with
coordinate σ is given by
pσ = ∂L
∂˙qσ
Therefore applying the above formula for coordinates r, θ, and z, we have:
pr = ∂L
∂˙r = m ˙r
pθ = ∂L
∂˙θ
= mr2 ˙θ
pz = ∂L
∂˙z = m ˙z
97

If we apply the same rule to the cartesian Lagrangian (150) we get:
px = ∂L
∂˙x = m ˙x,
py = ∂L
∂˙y = m ˙y,
with the z coordinate momentum unaltered. Using all the above information, we
can rewrite the cartesian momenta in terms of the cylindrical momenta, using the
momenta expressions above:
px = m ˙x = m[ ˙r cos(θ) −r sin(θ) ˙θ] = pr cos(θ) −1
rpθ sin(θ),
py = m[ ˙r sin(θ) + r cos(θ) ˙θ] = pr sin(θ) + 1
rpθ cos(θ).
We therefore can rewrite the generator of motion ˆL using the above information in
terms of cylindrical coordinates:
ˆL = −ipx

For the case with no magnetic potential, we will be solving the analogue to the time
independent Schr¨odinger equation,
ˆLψ = ˜Eψ,
where ψ is the KvN classical wavefunction and ˜E is the eigenvalue of the above
expression. Note that ˜E is certainly not the same as the Energy like in the Schr¨odinger
equation. We observe that ˆL commutes with −i ∂
∂θ, −i ∂
∂z, pθ, and pz. We can therefore
deduce that the wavefunction will have the form

only diﬀerence is that the representation of the operator ˆpθ is no longer going to be

(Gozzi and Mauro 2002). Making the substitution

If you compare (157) (case with magnetic potential) to (153) (case without magnetic
potential) you will notice they happen to be the same equation. This shows us that
the same solutions will exist for classical mechanics regardless of the presence or
absence of the gauge potential. As demonstrated, the gauge potential will however
99

aﬀect quantum systems (Gozzi and Mauro 2002; Mauro 2003).
On a philosophical level, the above analysis raises the question what do the gauge
potentials physically mean? Historically, it was simply seen as a mathematical tool
or convenience in the study of Electromagnetism. The electromagnetic ﬁeld and its
potentials were fully equivalent descriptions of reality, but the potentials were only
seen as a mathematical construct with useful properties. This might be a historic
example of physicists not taking the mathematics of their theory seriously enough.
For example, Albert Einstein famously invented the theories of special relativity by
acknowledging that the speed of light c is the same in all noninertial reference frames.
This is a fact tacitly present in Maxwell’s equations, but physicists at the time did
not treat the mathematics seriously enough and thought the equations must only be
true relative to a hypothetical ‘ﬂuid’ ﬁlling all of space and time, the aether, an idea
Einstein showed to be wrong. Aharonov and Bohm 1959 say in their paper “a further
interpretation of the potentials is needed in the quantum mechanics”, so perhaps this
is an area for further scientiﬁc investigation and discovery in the future.

Other Research
Wavefunctions in a complex Hilbert phase space can exactly model CM in the form of
statistical physics. Both QM and CM can be articulated in a common mathematical
language utilizing Hermitian operators to recover expectation values of observables.
In the pages above we covered a host of diﬀerent applications of the KvN wave-
function inside classical physics. We hardly exhausted the possible applications of
KvNM, however. There are many areas of research we have not even touched upon.
Some recent examples of the widespread applicability of the KvNM formulism:
1. Why the usage of ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert Spaces in QM and KvNM is often
ill-advised
A recent trends in QM research has been to try utilize QM with ﬁnite dimen-
sions instead of the regular inﬁnite Hilbert space. This is done to aid in clas-
100

sical computer modeling of quantum systems and an interest in the possibility
of rooting QM in a ﬁnite instead of an inﬁnite space. For instance, approxima-
tions of the quantum Hamiltonian tend to be ﬁnite matrices (Bondar, Cabrera,
and Rabitz 2013). Bondar, Cabrera, and Rabitz 2013 demonstrate that this will
unavoidably violate the Ehrenfest Theorems. This is a serious shortcoming of
ﬁnite dimensional treatments of QM, but there are a small number of ways that
the issues might be circumvented (Bondar, Cabrera, and Rabitz 2013).
2. KvNM has been used to study aspects of String Theory and the Gravitational
Principle of Equivalence
The KvN Path Integral is utilized in Carta and Mauro 2002 to study the prop-
erties of Classical Yang-Mills Theories (a subset of String Theories.) The Path
Integral provides geometrical tools like exterior derivatives, forms, etc. The
Classical Path Integral might shed light on the geometrical aspects of these
string theories (Carta and Mauro 2002). Sen, Dhasmana, and Silagadze 2020
investigates the validity of Einstein’s principle of mass equivalence for both
classical KvNM and quantum systems. Fisher information is discussed and
how it relates to insights from KvNM and QM. It is demonstrated that the weak
principle of equivalence holds in QM just as it does in KvNM (Sen, Dhasmana,
and Silagadze 2020).
3. ODM can be used to describe relativistic particles
The ODM paradigm is upheld in relativistic settings. The following two Ehrenfest-
like theorems were postulated (Cabrera et al. 2019) based on relativistic prin-
ciples
d
dt⟨ˆxk⟩= ⟨cγ0γk⟩.
d
dt⟨ˆpk⟩= ⟨ce∂k ˆAνγ0γν⟩.
If the quantum commutator is chosen, you can follow a series of steps similar
101

to those in section 3 to derive the famous Dirac equation, which governs rel-
ativistic quantum particles (Cabrera et al. 2019). If the Koopman Algebra is
chosen and you constrain the system from making antiparticles, the same se-
ries of steps as deriving the KvNM will give you the classical Spohn equation
(Cabrera et al. 2019). This is quite a surprising result - ODM can study spin
1/2 relativistic particles.
4. ODM has been used to study Time’s Arrow and stochastic behavior from de-
terminism
A lot of processes are reversible in physics, but our intuitions of the world are
that it is irreversible and things tend towards decay. How does irreversibility
arise out of the reversible? McCaul and Bondar 2021 utilizes the KvN Path
Integral to formulate a functional model for how irreversibility arises out of
the reversible laws we have.
5. Reformulation of Electromagnetism
Rajagopal and Ghose 2016 provides a reformulation of electromagnetic theory
that draws inspiration from the KvN theory.
6. KvN wavefunctions were utilized to understand the interaction of classical with
quantum systems
The problem of modeling quantum and classical system interaction is an old
one. Utilizing the KvN classical wavefunction, however, had led to new models
of how the interaction occurs. Not only does it describe the classical system’s
eﬀect on the quantum system, but uniquely it models how the quantum system
will impact the classical system in return (Bondar, Gay-Balmaz, and Tronci
2019). It also overcomes diﬃculty in some other models. For instance, the
quantum density matrix will always be positive-deﬁnite in this model (Bondar,
Gay-Balmaz, and Tronci 2019).
Among other areas of inquiry. Doubtlessly, many more areas of research that will
beneﬁt from KvNM and a paradigm like ODM.
102

It is important to have many “tools” in science when investigating novel phenom-
ena. Feynman famously said that the reason he had solved problems others could
not, is that his toolbox had a diﬀerent set of tools than everyone else. KvNM is yet
an another novel tool for you, the reader, to have in your toolkit. KvNM has and will
continue to shed light on new and exciting phenomena in science.

Appendices
A
Useful Mathematics for Hilbert Space Physics
Note: A lot of the following useful mathematics was found in the Appendix of Bon-
dar et al. 2012.
Theorem I: If you have a function of operator ˆA, i.e. f( ˆA), then the following
eigenvalue expressions are true:
f( ˆA) |A⟩= f(A) |A⟩
⟨A| f( ˆA) = ⟨A| f(A)
This should purposefully resemble the prior eigenvalue problem you are familiar
with, ˆA |A⟩= A |A⟩. This theorem is true for multivariable operators, for instance,
A(ˆq, ˆp) |q, p⟩= A(q, p) |q, p⟩
.
Theorem II (Resolution of Identity): The following theorem says that
I =
ˆ
dA |A⟩⟨A|
where I is the identity operator, functionally equivalent to multiplying an object by
1. Since it is just equal to 1, you can introduce the Resolution of Identity in a variety
of calculations. As always A is an arbitrary placeholder variable, and you can make
it any variable of interest.
Theorem III (Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality): It simply states that the following is al-
107

ways true for complex vectors in Hilbert Space:
⟨C|C⟩⟨D|D⟩≥| ⟨C|D⟩|2
where C and D are generic placeholder variables.
Theorem IV: If the commutator relationship between two generic operators ˆA and
ˆB is [ ˆA, ˆB] = iκ, then the following statements hold true:
⟨A| ˆB |ψ⟩= −iκ ∂
∂A ⟨A|ψ⟩
⟨B| ˆA |ψ⟩= iκ ∂
∂B ⟨B|ψ⟩
Recall that ⟨B|ψ⟩= ψ(B) and ⟨A|ψ⟩= ψ(A).
Theorem V: If the commutator relationship between two generic operators ˆA and
ˆB is [ ˆA, ˆB] = iκ, then the following statements hold true:
⟨A|B⟩=
1
√
2πκeiAB/κ
(158)
This is not diﬃcult to demonstrate. First, take Theorem IV and realize that |ψ⟩is a
general vector that can be substituted for a more speciﬁc vector. This is a common
practice in QM. Let us say that |ψ⟩= |B⟩. Then by Theorem IV we have:
⟨A| ˆB |B⟩= B ⟨A|B⟩= −iκ ∂
∂A ⟨A|B⟩
You can solve this common diﬀerential equation for the function ⟨A|B⟩to get:
⟨A|B⟩= CeiAB/κ
where C is a constant of integration. C can be found in the following way: Start with
equation (18)
108

⟨A|A′⟩= δ(A −A′)
and use Theorem II with A = B 26 to get:
⟨A|A′⟩= δ(A −A′) = ⟨A| I |A′⟩=
ˆ
dB ⟨A|B⟩⟨B|A′⟩
Since we know what ⟨A|B⟩is, we plug it in to get:
⟨A|A′⟩= δ(A −A′) =
ˆ
dB[CeiAB/κ][Ce−iA′B/κ] = C2
ˆ
dBei(A−A′)B/κ
From equation (22) of section 2, we can easily see that
ˆ
dBei(A−A′)B/κ = 2πκδ(A −A′)
Ergo,
δ(A −A′) = C22πκδ(A −A′)
C22πκ = 1
C2 =
1
2πκ
C =
1
√
2πκ
We now know C and have successfully demonstrated equation (158).
Theorem VI: As strange as it sounds, the mathematics of Hilbert Space deﬁnes deriva-
tives with respect to operators. If you have [ ˆAk, ˆB] = Constant, then a function of
operators f( ˆA1, ˆA2, ..., ˆAn) will obey the following rule:
[f( ˆA1, ˆA2, ..., ˆAn), ˆB] =
n
X
k=1
[ ˆAk, ˆB]∂f( ˆA1, ˆA2, ..., ˆAn)
∂ˆAk
26In other words, since A is just a generic placeholder for Theorem II, we will use I =
´
dB |B⟩⟨B|
109

Notice the partial derivative with respect to an operator. The next theorem shows how
to change this odd operator derivative to regular derivatives that we know and love.
Theorem VII The following is the relationship between derivatives with respect to
operators and the regular derivatives we are most generally familiar with:
∂f( ˆA1, ˆA2, ..., ˆAn)
∂ˆAk
=
1
(2π)n
ˆ
n
Y
l=1
dϵl dµl exp[i
n
X
q=1
µq( ˆAq −ϵq)]∂f(ϵ1, ϵ2, ..., ϵn)
∂ϵk
where on the left you can see the derivative with respect to an operator and on the
right you can see the derivative with respect to a scalar variable.
Theorem VIII: An integral of a Gaussian function has the following form:
ˆ ∞
−∞
e−ax2+bx+cdx =
rπ
ae
b2
4a+c
where a, b, and c can be real or imaginary constants.
B
The Principle of Causality and Stone’s Theorem
A unitary operator ˆU(t2, t1) always has the following properties:
1. Group product: ˆU(t3, t2) ˆU(t2, t1) = ˆU(t3, t1)
2. Reversibility: ˆU(t2, t1)† = ˆU(t2, t1)−1 = ˆU(t1, t2)
3. Identity: ˆU(t1, t1) = 1
The job of the unitary operator ˆU(t2, t1) is to bring you from t1 to t2. The group
product encapsulates the concept of cause and eﬀect, as you move from cause to
eﬀect through time. Causality is central to the philosophy of science, and we should
not be surprised that it pops up inside the mathematics of physics.
The three properties of the unitary operator above imply Stone’s Theorem:
110

If the three properties hold true, then the following relationship is also true:
i ∂
∂t
ˆU(t2, t1) = ˆG ˆU(t2, t1)
where ˆG is a Hermitian operator. If we assume that the wavefunction ket evolves via
the unitary operator
|ψ(t2)⟩= ˆU(t2, t1) |ψ(t1)⟩,
then we recover the Schr¨odinger-like equation we spoke of in earlier sections:
i ∂
∂t
ˆU(t2, t1) |ψ(t1)⟩= ˆG ˆU(t2, t1) |ψ(t1)⟩⇒i ∂
∂t |ψ(t2)⟩= ˆG |ψ(t2)⟩
This is the reason why Stone’s Theorem becomes an important ingredient in section
3.
C
Exponated Operators and the Propogator
Although it might seem odd at ﬁrst, exponated operators are allowed within Quantum
Mechanics. The Maclaurin series for the f(x) = ex is given by:
ex =
∞
X
n=0
xn
n! = 1 + 1
1!x + 1
2!x2 + 1
3!x3 + 1
4!x4 + · · ·
Let us say that you have a generic operator ˆA, like a square matrix. As long as ˆAn is
deﬁned for any real number n, then you can say:
e
ˆ
A =
∞
X
n=0
ˆAn
n! = 1 + 1
1!
ˆA + 1
2!
ˆA2 + 1
3!
ˆA3 + 1
4!
ˆA4 + · · ·
The Maclaurin series deﬁnes exponated operators as an inﬁnite sum.
If we have an expression such as e ˆ
At where ˆA is time-independent, we can also
derive a derivative rule for it:
111

(159)
The above relation is true even if a real or complex constant is placed in front of the
exponated term ˆAt. You can redo the exercise to convince yourself of this. We will
use this important fact in order to demonstrate the important relationship (52) is fully
equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation:
|ψ(t)⟩= e−i
ℏt ˆH |ψ(0)⟩
iℏ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= iℏ∂
∂te−i
ℏt ˆH |ψ(0)⟩= iℏ−i
ℏ
ˆHe−i
ℏt ˆH |ψ(0)⟩= ˆH |ψ(t)⟩
∴iℏ∂
∂t |ψ(t)⟩= ˆH |ψ(t)⟩
A similar derivation can be done for (66), to demonstrate that it is fully equivalent to
Stone’s Theorem (Appendix B).
