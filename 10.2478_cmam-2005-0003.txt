Abstract — Eﬀective exact transfer matrix algorithms have been developed to com-
pute the two-point correlation function G(r) of the 2D Ising model on a square ﬁnite-
size lattice. Systems including up to 800 spins have been considered and corrections
to the ﬁnite-size scaling at the critical point have been analysed. As a new result, we
have found that the correlation function computed at a distance r ∝L, where L is the
linear size of the lattice, has a nontrivial amplitude correction ∝L−0.25 of a very small
magnitude.

1. Introduction
Since the exact solution of the two-dimensional Lenz—Ising (or Ising) model was found by
Onsager [28], the study of various phase transition models has been of continuous interest.
Remarkable progress has been made in the exact solution of two-dimensional models [6]. The
transfer matrix method, applied to analytical calculations on two-dimensional lattices, is well
known [6, 28]. The loop counting method [7, 26] appers to be very eﬀective in calculating
the partition function, which takes a particularly simple form in the case of a square lattice
with Brascamp—Kunz boundary conditions [23]. The asymptotic behavior of the correlation
functions can be studied by means of the equations of the conformal ﬁeld theory [21]. Exact
equations for the two-point correlation function of the 2D Ising model on an inﬁnite lattice
are known, too [4]. However, no analytical methods for an exact calculation of the correlation
function in the 2D Ising model on ﬁnite-size lattices exist. This can be done numerically by
adopting the conventional transfer matrix method and modifying it to achieve the maximal
result (calculation of the largest possible system) with a minimal number of arithmetic
operations, as discussed in our paper.
Various modiﬁcations of similar enumeration methods, used to calculate the partition
function, the coeﬃcients of low-temperature series expansion, the density of states, etc., are
well known in the literature. This approach has been often applied to the Ising model on small
three-dimensional lattices. The early calculations belong to K. Binder [13], who calculated
the partition function (by computing the weight coeﬃcients for states with diﬀerent energies)
and the related internal energy and speciﬁc heat for lattices with open boundaries having
sizes up to 3 × 3 × 6 = 54 spins. In [8, 12] the enumeration of states has been done for

5 × 5 × 4 lattice. This method has been widely used to generate the coeﬃcients of the low-
temperature series expansion [9–11,17,19,20,32]. The computation time, which is necessary
for such calculations, can be reduced drastically by using some tricks. In particular, the
recursive calculations in [10] were performed by adding one spin at a time, which is much
faster than adding whole slices, as in earlier calculations [17]. As opposed to the papers
cited above, where 3D lattices with open boundaries were considered, we have used such a
trick to calculate the correlation function on two-dimensional lattices with periodic boundary
conditions. In this case, the use of symmetries is very helpful, too, as discussed in Section 2.1.
Another trick that we have used is a special way of growing the lattice by adding slices (each
of them being grown spin-by-spin) oriented in the diagonal ⟨11⟩crystallographic direction.
It allows to enumerate a lattice with a linear size
√
2 times larger than in the usual case of
the ⟨10⟩direction without dramatical increase in the computation time.
The transfer matrix method was used to enumerate the two-dimensional Ising model
on ﬁnite-size lattices in [15, 16, 24]. In [24], the universal ratio of the magnetisation (m)
moments U = ⟨m4⟩/⟨m2⟩2 (which is related to the Binder cumulant 1 −U/3) at the critical
point was examined for square and triangular lattices with periodic boundary conditions and
sizes up to L = 17 and L = 16, respectively. The capability of the transfer matrix method in
numerical calculation of the restricted density of the states in the energy-magnetisation space
was demonstrated in [16], where strips of width up to L = 13 were considered. In [15] the
susceptibility at the critical point was calculated for ﬁnite-size square lattices with periodic
boundary conditions and sizes L ⩽17. Our improved algorithms allowed us to compute the
two-point correlation function at criticality for somewhat larger lattices, consisting of ⩽800
spins and having a linear size of up to 20
√
2 lattice spacings.
Like in many papers (see [1,2,4,5,15,18,23,27,29–31] and references therein), our aim
is to study the corrections to the scaling in the 2D Ising model. Although it is one of the
best investigated models in statistical mechanics, corrections to the scaling is a notoriously
diﬃcult problem, and the results are somewhat controversial. It has been well established
that corrections to the scaling for free energy, internal energy, speciﬁc heat, and zeroes of
the partition function are represented by integer correction-to-scaling exponents. It refers
both to the ﬁnite-size corrections at (or near) criticality and the expansion in powers of the
reduced temperature t = T/Tc −1 →0 (where Tc is the critical value of temperature T) in
the thermodynamical limit.
Nevertheless, there are some uncertainties regarding the susceptibility.
Aharony and
Fisher [1, 2] predicted a scaling amplitude function that is equal above and below Tc, sug-
gesting that the Ising model critical region can be described entirely by two nonlinear scaling
ﬁelds. The high-temperature (HT) series analysis in [4,27,29] revealed a deviation from this
law at order t4 in the expansion of the leading amplitude. It was also conﬁrmed by certain
conjectures of the conformal ﬁeld theory and renormalisation group arguments [15]. The
results obtained in [27] are consistent with the leading nontrivial corrections that are (am-
plitude) modiﬁcations of the existing terms of the form | t |9/4 or t2 ln | t |. The HT results
of [4, 29], however, support the existence of only integer correction-to-scaling exponents,
although logarithmic corrections appear, as consistent with [15]. A correction-to-scaling ex-
ponent 4/3 was proposed earlier in [5] for some models of the 2D Ising universality class. It
has been found, however, that this correction vanishes in the Ising case [5].
Our results complete the current knowledge about this problem. In particular, we have
found that a nontrivial correction to ﬁnite-size scaling appears in the two-point correlation
function, which is directly related to the susceptibility (cf. Section 4).

tion function in the 2D Ising model
2.1. Adoption of standard methods
We consider a two-dimensional Ising model where spins are located either on the lattice of
dimensions N × L, illustrated in Fig. 1a, or on the lattice of dimensions
√

in Fig. 1b. The periodic boundaries are indicated by dashed lines. In the case (a), we have L
rows and in the case (b) — 2L rows, each containing N spins. Figure 1 shows an illustrative
example with N = 4 and L = 3. In our notation nodes are numbered consecutively from
left to right, and rows — from bottom to top.

where σi = ±1 are the spin variables, and the summation runs over all possible spin con-
ﬁgurations {σk}. The argument of the exponent represents a Hamiltonian of the system
including summation over all neighbouring spin pairs ⟨i, j⟩of the given conﬁguration {σk};
the parameter β is the coupling constant. We call the factors exp (β σiσj) contained in (1)
the Boltzmann weights of bonds.
Let us consider the lattice (a) in Fig. 1 containing n rows without periodic boundaries
along the vertical axis and without interaction between the spins in the upper row. We
deﬁne the 2N-component vector rn such that the ith component of this vector represents
the contribution to the partition function made by the ith spin conﬁguration of the upper
row, i. e., the sum over all states of the spin system with a ﬁxed (ith) conﬁguration of
this row. Then we have a recurrence relation rn+1 = T rn, where T is the transfer matrix
which includes the Boltzmann weights of the newly added bonds. Furthermore, we can write
r(i)
n+1 = T r(i)
n , where r(i)
n is the partial contribution to rn made by the ith conﬁguration of
the ﬁrst row. The components of r(i)

the well-known expression [6,22]

matrices T1 and T2 for odd and even row numbers n, respectively.
The actual scheme can be easily adopted to calculate the correlation function ⟨σiσj⟩
between any two lattice points i and j. Namely, the correlation function G(x) between the
points separated by a distance x, as indicated in Fig. 1, is given by the statistical average
Z′/Z, where the sum Z′ is calculated in the same way as Z, but including the corresponding
product of the spin variables. It implies the following replacements:

[σ(k)]i is the spin variable in the kth node in a row provided that the whole set of spin
variables of this row forms the ith conﬁguration. It is supposed that σ(k + N) ≡σ(k) holds
according to the periodic boundary conditions. Such a symmetrical form, which includes
the averaging over ℓ, allows to reduce the amount of numerical calculations: due to the
symmetry we need the summation over only ≈2N/N nonequivalent conﬁgurations of the
ﬁrst row instead of the total number of 2N conﬁgurations.
2.2. Improved algorithms
The number of the required arithmetic operations can be further reduced if the recurrence
relations r(i)
n+1 = T r(i)
n
and r(i)
n+1 = T1,2 r(i)
n
are split into N steps of adding a single spin.
To formulate this in a suitable way, let us ﬁrst number all the 2N spin conﬁgurations
{σ(1); σ(2); · · · ; σ(N −1); σ(N)} by index i as follows:
i = 1

We remind that the sequence of numbers in the ith row corresponds to the spin variables
[σ(k)]i with k = 1, 2, . . . , N. They change with i just like the digits of subsequent integer
numbers in the binary counting system.

Figure 2. Schematical representation of the algorithms of calculation for the lattices a and b introduced in
Fig. 1
Consider now a lattice where n rows are completed, while the (n+1)-th row contains only
ℓspins, where ℓ< N, as illustrated in Fig. 2 in both cases (a) and (b) taking as an example
N = 4. We consider the partial contribution (rn+1,ℓ)i (i. e., the ith component of vector
rn+1,ℓ) to the partition function Z (or Z′) made by a ﬁxed (ith) conﬁguration of the set of
N upper spins. These are the consecutively numbered spins shown in Fig. 2 by open circles.
For simplicity, we have dropped the index denoting the conﬁguration of the ﬁrst row. In the
case (b), the spin depicted by a double-circle has a ﬁxed value of σ′. In general, this spin
is the nearest bottom-left neighbour of the ﬁrst spin in the upper row. According to this,
one has to distinguish between odd and even n: σ′ refers either to the ﬁrst (for odd n) or
to the Nth (for even n) spin of the nth row. It is supposed that the Boltzmann weights are
included corresponding to the solid lines in Fig. 2 connecting the spins. In the case (a), the
weights responsible for the interaction between the upper numbered spins are not included.
Obviously, for a given ℓ> 1, rn+1,ℓcan be calculeted from rn+1,ℓ−1 via summation over one
spin variable, marked in Fig. 2 by a cross. In the case (a), it is also true for ℓ= 1, whereas in
the case (b) this variable has a ﬁxed value of σ′ at ℓ= 1. In the latter case, the summation
over σ′ is performed in the last step when the (n + 1)-th row is already completed. These
manipulations enable us to write for the case (a)

where [σ(N + 1)]i ≡σ′ and the index j1(σ, ℓ, i) is given by (10). For the other index we have
j2(σ, 1, i) = 2i −2N−1 ([σ(1)]i + 1) + 1

(14)
Note that the matrices f
Wℓand f

have only two nonzero elements in each row, so that
the number of arithmetic operations required for the construction of one row of spins via a
subsequent calculation of the vectors rn+1,ℓincreases like 2N · 2N instead of 22N operations
necessary for a straightforward calculation of the vector Trn. Taking into account the above
symmetry of the ﬁrst row, the computation time is proportional to 22LL for both L × L (a)
and

2L (b) lattices in Fig. 1 with periodic boundary conditions.
2.3. Application to diﬀerent boundary conditions
The developed algorithms can easily be extended to lattices with antiperiodic boundary
conditions. The latter implies that σ(N + 1) = −σ(N) holds for each row, and a similar
condition is true for each column. We can also consider mixed boundary conditions: periodic
along the horizontal axis and antiperiodic along the vertical one, or vice versa. To replace
the periodic boundary conditions with antiperiodic ones, we need only to change the sign
of the corresponding products of the spin variables on the boundaries. Consider, e. g., the
case (a) in Fig. 1. The change of the boundary conditions along the vertical axis means that
the ﬁrst term in the argument of the exponent in each of the Eqs. (9) changes the sign for
the last row, i. e., when n = L. The same along the horizontal axis implies that the term
[σ(N)]i in the equation for (W1(σ))ij changes the sign. In this case, however, the symmetry
of the conﬁgurations of the ﬁrst row is partly broken and, therefore, we need summation
over a larger number of nonequivalent conﬁgurations.

3. Transfer matrix study of the critical correlation function and
corrections to the scaling in the 2D Ising model
3.1. General scaling arguments
It is well known [3] that in the thermodynamic limit the correlation function of the Ising
model behaves like G(r) ∝r2−d−η at large distances r →∞at the critical (i. e., phase
transition) point β = βc, where η is the critical exponent having the value η = 1/4 in
two dimensions (d = 2). Based on our transfer matrix algorithms developed in Section 2,
here we test the corrections to the scaling in the 2D Ising model at the critical point [6]
β = βc = 1

¡

√

.
According to the general arguments of the ﬁnite-size scaling theory [14], the expected
ﬁnite-size scaling relation for the critical correlation function, i. e., for G(r) at the critical
point β = βc, reads
G(r) ≃r2−d−η f(r/L) :
r →∞,
L →∞,
(15)
where the scaling function f(z) depends also on the crystallographic orientation of the line
connecting the correlating spins, as well as on the orientation of the periodic boundaries. A
natural extension of (15), including the corrections to the scaling, is
G(r) =
X
ℓ⩾0
r−λℓfℓ(r/L) ,
(16)
where the term with λ0 ≡d −2 + η is the leading one, whereas those with the subsequently
increasing exponents λ1, λ2, etc., represent the corrections to the scaling. The substitution
fℓ(z) = zλℓf ′(z) transforms the asymptotic expansion (16) to

(17)
where ˜fℓ(z) = f ′
ℓ(z)/f0(z) and ωℓ= λℓ−λ0 are the correction-to-scaling exponents. To
get some idea about the exponents ωℓ, it is useful to consider ﬁrst the thermodynamic limit
L →∞or r/L →0. In particular, the critical correlation function G(r) of the 2D Ising
model in ⟨11⟩crystallographic direction on an inﬁnite lattice can be calculated easily based
on the known exact formulae [4], and it yields G(r) ∝r−1/4 [1 + O (r−2)] at large distances
r →∞. The structure of the asymptotic expansion is consistent with ωℓ= 2ℓin this case.
Nevertheless, our calculations in the 2D Ising model discussed in Section 3.2 indicate the
existence of a nontrivial ﬁnite-size correction of the kind of L−1/4. The thermodynamic limit
is a particular case of the ﬁnite-size scaling with the scaling argument r/L →0, therefore it
is possible that the nontrivial corrections to the correlation function in the 2D Ising model
vanish in this special case, but not in general.
3.2. Correction-to-scaling analysis for the

Based on the scaling analysis in Section 3.1, here we discuss the corrections to the scaling
for the
√

2L lattice in Fig. 1b. We have calculated the correlation function G(r) at
r = L in the ⟨10⟩direction with the aim to identify the correction exponents ωℓin (17).
Further we use the notation ω1 ≡ω.

Transfer matrix study of ﬁnite-size corrections in the 2D Ising model
79
Let us deﬁne the eﬀective correction-to-scaling exponent ωeﬀ(L) via the solution of the
equations
˜L1/4G(r = ˜L) = a + b ˜L−ωeﬀ
(18)
at ˜L = L, L + ∆L, L + 2∆L for three unknown quantities ωeﬀ, a, and b. According to (17),
where λ0 = η = 1/4, such a deﬁnition gives us the leading correction-to-scaling exponent ω
at L →∞, i. e., limL→∞ωeﬀ(L) = ω.
The calculated values of G(r) at r = L and the corresponding eﬀective exponents ωeﬀ(L),
determined at ∆L = 1, are given in Table 1. Within the considered range of sizes L, the
eﬀective exponent ωeﬀ(L) converges to a value of about 2. The obtained sequence of ωeﬀ(L)
can be extrapolated to L = ∞. For this purpose we have considered the ratio of the following
two increments in ωeﬀ,
ρ(L) = ωeﬀ(L + ∆L) −ωeﬀ(L)
ωeﬀ(L) −ωeﬀ(L −∆L) .
(19)
A simple analysis shows that ρ(L) behaves like
ρ(L) = 1 −∆L · (ω′ + 1)L−1 + O
¡
L−2¢
(20)
at L →∞if ωeﬀ(L) = ω + O
¡
L−ω′¢
holds with an exponent ω′ > 1. Let the values of
ωeﬀ(L) be known up to L = Lmax. Then we can calculate from (19) the ρ(L) values up to
L = Lmax −∆L and make a suitable ansatz like
ρ(L) = 1 −3∆L · L−1 + b L−2
at
L ⩾Lmax
(21)
for a formal extrapolation of ωeﬀ(L) to L = ∞. This is consistent with (20) where ω′ = 2.
The coeﬃcient b is found by matching the result to the precisely calculated value at L =
Lmax −∆L. The subsequent values of ωeﬀ(L), calculated from (19) and (21) at L > Lmax,
converge to some value eω(Lmax) at L →∞. If the leading correction-to-scaling exponent ω
is 2, then the extrapolation result eω(Lmax) will tend to 2 at Lmax →∞irrespective of the
precise value of ω′. It is evident from Table 1 that the extrapolated values of the eﬀective
correction exponent, i. e., eω(L), come surprisingly close to 2 at certain L values. Besides,
the ratio of increments ρ(L) in this case is well approximated by (21), as consistent with the
existence of a correction term in (17) with exponent 4. These observations coincide with the
idea that ωℓ= 2ℓholds, like in the case of an inﬁnite lattice.
On the other hand, we can see from Table 1 that ∆eω(L) = eω(L) −2 tends to increase in
magnitude at L > 13. We have illustrated this systematic and smooth deviation in Fig. 3.
The only reasonable explanation of this behavior is that expansion (17) necessarily contains
exponent 2 and, likely, also exponent 4, and at the same time it contains also a correction of
a very small amplitude with ω < 2. The latter explains the increase in ∆eω(L). Namely, the
correction to the scaling for L1/4G(L) behaves like const · L−2 [1 + O (L−2) + ε L2−ω] with
ε ≪1, which implies a slow crossover of the eﬀective exponent ωeﬀ(L) from values of about
2 to the asymptotic value ω. Besides, in the region where ε L2−ω ≪1 holds, the eﬀective
exponent behaves like
ωeﬀ(L) ≃2 + b1L2−ω + b2L−2 ,
(22)
where b1 ≪1 and b2 are constants. Note that the trivial corrections ∝L−n with an integer
n ⩾2 appear in the expansion of ωeﬀ(L) according to (17) and (18), taking into account
that (17) contains correction exponents 2, 4, 6, etc., in general (since otherwise they could not
have shown up at r/L →0). By using the extrapolation of ωeﬀwith ω′ = 2 in (20) and (21),

we have compensated the eﬀect of the correction term b2L−2. Besides, by matching the
amplitude b in (21) we have compensated also the next trivial correction term ∼L−3 in the
expansion of ωeﬀ(L). It means that the extrapolated exponent eω(L) does not contain these
expansion terms, i. e., we have
eω(L) = 2 + b1L2−ω + δeω(L) ,
(23)
where δeω(L) represents a remainder term. It includes trivial corrections like L−4, L−5, etc.,
and also subleading nontrivial corrections, as well as corrections of order (ε L2−ω)2, (ε L2−ω)3,
etc., neglected in (22). According to the latter, Eq. (23) is meaningless in the thermodynamic
limit L →∞, but it can be used to evaluate the correction-to-scaling exponent ω from the
transient behavior at large, but not too large values of L where b1L2−ω ≪1 holds. In our
example the latter condition is well satisﬁed, indeed.
Based on (23), we have estimated the nontrivial correction-to-scaling exponent ω by using
the data of eω(L) in Table 1. We have used two diﬀerent ansatzs
2 −ω1(L) = ln [∆eω(L)/∆eω(L −1)] / ln[L/(L −1)]
(24)
and
2 −ω2(L) = L [∆eω(L) −∆eω(L −1)] /∆eω(L) ,

A = 104, as a function of L−4. The extrapolation has been made by using the calculated G(r) values in
Table 1 up to the size L+2. A linear convergence to zero would be expected in the absence of any nontrivial
correction terms
as well as the linear combination of them
ω(L) = (1 −α) ω1(L) + α ω2(L)
(26)
containing a free parameter α. We have ω(L) = ω1(L) at α = 0 and ω(L) = ω2(L) at α = 1.
In general, the eﬀective exponent ω(L) converges to the same result ω at an arbitrary value
of α, but at certain values the convergence is better. The results for 2 −ω(L) vs Lω−6 at
diﬀerent α values are presented in Fig. 4 by a set of curves. In this scale the convergence to
the asymptotic value would be linear (within the actual region where L ≫1 and b1 L2−ω ≪1
hold) for α = 0 under the condition δeω(L) ∝L−4. We have chosen the scale of L−5.75, as
it is consistent with our result ω = 1/4. Nothing is changed if we use a slightly diﬀerent
scale, e. g., L−4 consistent with ω = 2 or L−14/3 consistent with the correction-to-scaling
exponent ω = 4/3 proposed for some models of the 2D Ising universality class in [5]. As we

by a dashed line, which corresponds to ω = 1/4. The optimal value of α is deﬁned by the
condition that the last two estimates ω(17) and ω(18) agree with each other. It occurs at
α = 7.243, and the last two points lie just on the dashed line.
3.3. Comparison to the known exact results and estimation of numerical errors
We have carefully checked our algorithms comparing the results with those obtained via a
straightforward counting of all spin conﬁgurations for small lattices, as well as comparing the
obtained values of the partition function to those calculated from the known exact analytical
expressions [7]. The relative discrepancies were extremely small (e. g., 10−15), obviously, due
to the purely numerical inaccuracy.
We have used the double-precision FORTRAN programs. The numerical errors in Table 1
have been estimated by repeating some calculations with a twice larger number of digits
(REAL*16 option). Thus, the errors in the G(L) values for L = 10 to L = 17 are 4.7 · 10−17,
4.06·10−16, −3.52·10−16, −5.65·10−16, 1.03·10−15, 1.41·10−15, −1.71·10−16, and 3.09·10−16. To
eliminate the summation error for the largest lattice L = 20, we have split the summation
over the conﬁgurations of the ﬁrst row into several parts in such a way that a relatively
small part, including only the ﬁrst 10 000 conﬁgurations from the total number of 52 487
nonequivalent ones, makes the main contribution to Z and Z′. The same trick with splitting
into two approximately equal parts has been used at L = 19. As a result, the numerical
errors at L = 18, 19, 20 are not much larger than the above listed values for 10 ⩽L ⩽17. The
resulting numerical errors in Fig. 4 are comparable to 0.03 (they are larger on the periphery
and smaller in the middle part around 2 −ω ∼1.75), i. e., about the symbol size. In Fig. 3,
the errors are practically not seen.
4. Discussion
Using our method of eﬀective exponents, we have also analysed the corrections to the scaling
for the correlation function G(r) on an inﬁnite lattice computed by the exact formulae given
in [4]. In this case, the eﬀective exponents depend on ﬁnite distances r used in the estimations
based on (16), where r/L = 0. We have found that eωeﬀ(r) for the correlation function in
diﬀerent crystallographic directions converges to 2 in complete agreement with ωℓ= 2ℓ. It
is consistent with the analytical solution for the ⟨11⟩direction. The latter shows that our
method is not misleading, and the nontrivial correction we have found before is a real ﬁnite-
size eﬀect. This is an essentially new result, since the known results (see [18, 30, 31] and
references therein) for the thermodynamic functions (free energy, internal energy, speciﬁc
heat) show only “trivial” corrections with integer correction-to-scaling exponents. Besides,
it was proved in [23] for the case of the Brascamp—Kunz boundary conditions that no
nontrivial corrections to the ﬁnite-size scaling show up in zeroes of the partition function
and in related quantities like speciﬁc heat. There is no contradiction with our result, since
the correlation function cannot be calculated from the zeroes of the partition function and
contains more detailed information about the model than the partition function depending
on the temperature and the system size.
It is interesting to compare our results with those of the high temperature series analysis
in [4, 27, 29]. An evidence was provided in [27] for the existence of a correction term with
the correction-to-scaling exponent θ = 9/4 in the asymptotic expansion of the susceptibility
χ approaching the critical point t = |β −βc|/βc →0. According to the known ﬁnite-size

83
scaling arguments [14], θ is related to the ﬁnite-size correction exponent ω by θ = νω, where
ν is the critical exponent describing the divergence of the correlation length ξ ∼t−ν at
t →0. If a correction with θ = 9/4 exists in the susceptibility, then it must be present also
in the correlation function due to the relation χ = P
x G(x1 −x), where the summation runs
over the set of vectors x pointing from the origin to all possible lattice sites. The inverse
statement is not true: a nontrivial correction term existing in the correlation function can
vanish in χ due to the summation of contributions with opposite signs. Our calculations
by exact algorithms have not revealed the ﬁnite-size correction ∝L−9/4 corresponding to
θ = 9/4 at the critical point. Hence, either it has a too small amplitude or is absent. The
latter would be consistent with the idea that the statement of [4, 29] about the presence
of only integer correction-to-scaling exponents in the susceptibility can be extended to the
ﬁnite-size scaling. Our analysis at the critical point β = βc, however, does not exclude the
possibility that nontrivial corrections appear in the susceptibility away from βc at ξ ∝L.
Besides, nontrivial corrections to the scaling can easily be overseen in a numerical analysis, if
they have very small amplitudes (e. g. 10−6 or smaller), as in our case of the L−1/4 correction.
The correction with ω = 1/4, as well as that with ω = 9/4 can be, in principle, expected
in view of the theory developed in [25]. According to [25], the singular structure of the
correlation function in the thermodynamic limit at t →0 is represented by the correction-
to-scaling exponents θℓ= ℓη (with ℓ= 1, 2, 3, . . .), which correspond to the exponents
ωℓ= θℓ/ν in the ﬁnite-size scaling. In the 2D Ising model, where ν = 1 and η = 1/4 [6],
we have θℓ= ωℓ, so that ω = 1/4 correponds to ℓ= 1 and ω = 9/4 — to ℓ= 9. Besides,
some of the expansion coeﬃcients can be zero [25], therefore it is possible that only a subset
of the whole set of exponents ωℓ= ℓη/ν appears. From this point of view, it is possible
that nontrivial corrections to the scaling show up only in the correlation function and are
canceled in the susceptibility due to the summation.
It was conjectured in [15] that all corrections to the scaling in the 2D Ising model arise
from the breaking of rotational symmetry within framework of the conformal ﬁeld theory.
This conjecture is based solely on the fact that it explains all known and established cor-
rections to the scaling. The question arises whether or not the L−1/4 correction proposed
by our analysis can also be explained in this way. The negative answer would mean that
possibly other sources of ﬁnite-size corrections exist. In this aspect, it was mentioned in [15]
(see p. 30, top) that the lattice Ising model shows also features that are not predicted by
the conformal ﬁeld theory and the renormalisation group.
5. Conclusions
The two-point correlation function of the 2D Ising model at the critical point has been
calculated numerically by the exact transfer matrix algorithms developed in this paper. The
results for ﬁnite lattices including up to 800 spins point to existence of a nontrivial correction
to the ﬁnite-size scaling with a very small amplitude and an exponent of about 1/4. It is
in contrast to the case of the inﬁnite lattice, where no nontrivial corrections to the scaling
have been observed. Our results agree with the theory developed in [25].
