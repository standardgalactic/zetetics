Of all the systems in statistical mechanics on which exact calculations 
have been performed, the two-dimensional Ising model is not only the 
most thoroughly investigated; it is also the richest and most profound. 
In 1925, Ising introduced the statistical system which now bears his name 
and studied some of its properties in one dimension. Although the 
generalization of Ising's system to higher dimensions was immediately 
obvious, it was not until 1941 that a quantitative statement about the 
phase transition in the two-dimensional case was made when Kramers 
and Wannier and also Montroll computed the Curie (or critical) tempera-
ture. However, the most remarkable development was made in 1944 when 
Onsager was able to compute the thermodynamic properties of the two-
dimensional lattice in the absence of a magnetic field. Onsager's approach 
was greatly simplified by Kaufman in 1949, and in a companion paper 
Kaufman and Onsager studied spin correlation functions. The spon-
taneous magnetization was first published, without derivation, by 
Onsager in 1949, and the first derivation was given by Yang in 1952. For 
the next decade no new result of fundamental significance was derived, 
but a great deal was accomplished in simplifying the mathematics of 
these pioneering papers. The work of Kac, Kasteleyn, Montroll, Potts, 
Szegö, and Ward, among others, has been especially significant. 
The methods of Onsager, Kaufman, and Yang, although very beauti-
ful and powerful, are also extremely complicated. Thus, the two-dimen-
sional Ising model has acquired a notorious reputation for difficulty 
whereas, in fact, the simplified methods developed by 1963 have reduced 
the analysis to the point where it may be readily understood. Since then 
we have actively used these methods as the basis for computing many 

[viii] 
PREFACE 
more quantities of physical interest. Our original concern was with the 
spin correlation functions of the two-dimensional Ising model. However, 
it soon became apparent that much more could be studied. In particular, 
we found that the Ising model has properties which exhibit a hysteresis 
behavior. Moreover, we discovered that exact results can be obtained 
even in a much more complicated situation where the interaction between 
the spins is allowed to be a random variable. On the basis of these results, 
a quantitative study of the influence of impurities on phase transitions 
has been carried out. This influence is large and has experimental con-
sequences that have yet to be fully explored. 
Since the two-dimensional Ising model forms the basis of much of our 
theoretical understanding of phase transitions, it is unfortunate that these 
recent developments have not been easily accessible to the general com-
munity of physicists. Perhaps as a result of its notoriety, most physicists 
tend to think of the two-dimensional Ising model as a closed problem 
that was completely solved by Onsager, Kaufman, and Yang. Moreover, 
once a physicist does become aware of the wide variety of open questions 
there is no convenient place where he can find the known facts collected 
together and explained in an organized fashion. Furthermore, even if one 
has the patience to trace the references back to Kasteleyn's paper of 1961, 
the usual result is a feeling of confusion. This confusion arises not out of 
any errors in the published work, but out of the fact that in journal 
articles many things must be omitted owing to lack of space. Therefore, 
points that can be straightened out and rigorously shown to cause no 
problems are often treated very briefly. The careful reader therefore has 
questions that he must resolve for himself and the resolutions are 
frequently quite time consuming. 
The study of the two-dimensional Ising model requires the use of 
mathematics from such apparently widely separated areas as the theory 
of determinants and integral equations. Few physicists are knowledgeable 
in all these branches of mathematics. Therefore, a formula that may have 
been well known to a mathematician of 100 years ago may be totally 
unknown to a physicist of today. It is quite impossible to discuss such a 
formula in ajournai article. One must call it "well known," give a refer-
ence, and go on. But the reference is often useless because, while correct, 
it usually is so arranged that the reader must spend an inordinate amount 
of time in mastering a lot of notation which is mostly superfluous if he 
wants to derive only one particular formula. For example, in our study 
of Ising-model spin correlation functions we make extensive use of the 
theory of Wiener-Hopf sum equations. Except as an afterthought to the 
theory of Wiener-Hopf integral equations, these sum equations are rarely 
discussed in the literature. This circumstance often leads one to believe 
that the sum equations are harder than the integral equations. In fact 
they are simpler.

P R E F A C E 
For these reasons we feel that it is at this time most desirable to write 
a book on the two-dimensional Ising model that has the following three 
goals: 
(1) It should be completely up to date and be crystal clear in its state-
ment of what is known and, more important, what is as yet unknown. 
(2) It should discuss all topics in complete detail. No significant point 
should be dismissed with the casual remark "it can be shown." 
(3) It should strive to be self-contained. All mathematical statements 
that are not known by the average graduate student in physics should be 
proved. 
The present book, which sets forth the theory of the two-dimensional 
Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions as it has developed 
through the end of 1969, is our attempt at meeting these three goals. In 
particular, we have tried to make this book complete in such a manner 
that the physicist can read it without consulting any additional source. 
To this end we have assumed that the reader knows no statistical me-
chanics at all and have included at the beginning a chapter that develops 
all the statistical mechanics needed for the entire book. Furthermore, 
though we do not feel justified in including a chapter on special functions, 
we have not assumed a familiarity with mathematics beyond a basic 
understanding of complex-variable theory. 
For the sake of readability we abandon altogether any attempt at 
preserving the historical development of the Ising model and, in fact, give 
no exposition whatsoever of the original work of Onsager, Kaufman, 
and Yang. The development we follow instead should be obvious from 
the chapter headings in the table of contents. Only three points deserve 
special attention. First, the interrelations between the chapters are shown 
in Fig. 0.1. Secondly, we have chosen to give a thorough treatment of 
Fig. 0.1. The interrelations of the chapters.

boundary effects before any study is made of bulk spin correlation func-
tions. We have made this choice because the calculations for the boundary 
are much easier to understand and are more complete than the corre-
sponding calculations for the bulk. Lastly, we wish to call the reader's 
attention to Chapter IV. This is the most crucial chapter in the book 
because everything that is done later depends on it. For this reason, in 
Chapter IV we attempt to give a complete and detailed discussion of all 
the fine points. However, several of these details have to do only with 
straightening out certain + and — signs associated with the various 
boundary conditions that may be imposed on the lattice. Accordingly, 
if the reader is willing to accept the conclusions of Sections 4 and 5 of 
Chapter IV, he may omit the derivations without impairing his ability to 
read the rest of the book. In fact, we will suggest that the book may be 
profitably read with the omission of Chapter IV altogether, even though 
this is the most crucial chapter, because the results of this chapter are much 
more easily stated and used than they are proved. Moreover, the several 
open questions we will arrive at already incorporate the combinatorics of 
Chapter IV in their formulation. Therefore, it is perfectly possible to 
appreciate the current status of the physics of the Ising model without a full 
understanding of the combinatorial problem involved. Indeed, this was 
precisely the route that we took ourselves when we first entered the field. 
If the authors of any scientific book are to be fair to the reader, it is as 
important for them to indicate what is omitted as to explain what is 
covered. Not a book, but an encyclopedia, results if an effort is made to 
include all related topics, related related topics, and so on. For this book 
we mention the conspicuous omission of the following five related topics: 
(1) high- and low-temperature expansions, (2) Padé approximants, (3) the 
circle theorem of Lee and Yang, (4) decorated lattices, and (5) theorems 
that prove the existence of limits or of analyticity without actually 
computing the quantity involved. 
One of us (TTW) would like to express special gratitude to Professor 
Ronold W. P. King and Professor Elliott W. Montroll. Because of the 
insistence of Professor King that each student must be allowed to decide 
his own interest and pick his own topic, it has been a most rewarding 
experience to write a doctorial dissertation under his guidance. Further-
more, without his continual encouragement and help in every respect 
of this present book, its completion would be impossible. Professor 
Montroll taught us the Pfaffian approach to the two-dimensional Ising 
model. The influence of his two papers, "Lattice Statistics" (Chapter IV, 
Applied Combinatorial Mathematics, ed. E. F. Beckenbach, Wiley, New 
York, 1964) and "Correlations and Spontaneous Magnetization of the 
Two-Dimensional Ising Model" (with R. Β. Potts and J. C. Ward, 
J. Math. Phys. 4, 308, 1963), is particularly evident in Chapter IV and 
Chapter VIII of this book.

Introduction 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 
Statistical mechanics is an old and venerable branch of physics which 
has received the attention of many physicists from the time of Gibbs. 
Since then it has developed in several directions so that at present it is 
possible to distinguish at least three different theoretical approaches to 
the subject: (1) the foundational approach, which is concerned with 
establishing the general properties of, and proving existence theorems for, 
statistical mechanical systems by rigorous mathematical means, (2) the 
phenomenological approach, which is concerned with correlating and 
quantitatively explaining the results of experiments by any available 
method, and (3) the model-building approach, which attempts to gain 
insight into practical situations by studying simple models in which at 
least some physically interesting quantities may be exactly computed. 
Each of these approaches has made such valuable contributions to our 
understanding of statistical mechanics that it is neither feasible nor 
desirable to separate them completely. However, because each approach 
has developed such a large body of literature, it is likewise not possible 
to give an adequate treatment of all of them in a single book. Therefore, 
while we will attempt to make this book self-contained by giving a brief 
discussion of the foundation of statistical mechanics, and while we will 
attempt to place the book in a somewhat broader context by making 
contact with the existing experimental situation, we will concentrate our 
efforts on the study of certain solvable models. 
The number of exactly solvable problems in a field depends on the 
complexity of the subject. For example, there are innumerable solvable 
problems in classical mechanics, whereas, at the other extreme, very few 
problems in relativistic quantum field theory have ever been exactly 

[2] 
THE T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L ISING MODEL 
solved. The scarcity of solvable models in both statistical mechanics and 
relativistic quantum field theory is due basically to the fact that, in a 
system with a very large number of particles, each particle may indirectly 
interact with an enormous number of others even if the fundamental 
interaction is two-body and of short range. However, it is the purpose of 
statistical mechanics to study systems with a large number of particles, 
and the phenomena of greatest interest are precisely those which are not 
present in the classical or quantum mechanics of a small number of 
particles. Therefore, a criterion for the usefulness of any model in statisti-
cal mechanics is its capability of giving us insight into the new phenomena 
characteristic of a large number of particles. 
The most characteristic feature of statistical mechanical systems is the 
existence of phase transitions. Surely the most familiar phase transition is 
either the condensation of steam into water or the freezing of water into 
ice. Only slightly less familiar is the ferromagnetic phase transition that 
takes place at the Curie temperature, which, as an example, is roughly 
1043°K for iron. Of the several existing models which exhibit a phase 
transition, the most famous is the Ising model. In three dimensions the 
model is so complicated that no exact computation has ever been made, 
while in one dimension the Ising model does not undergo a phase transi-
tion. However, it is one of the most beautiful discoveries of twentieth-
century physics that in two dimensions the Ising model not only has a 
ferromagnetic phase transition but also has very many physical properties 
which may be exactly computed. Indeed, despite the restriction on 
dimensionality, the two-dimensional Ising model exhibits all of the 
phenomena peculiar to magnetic systems near the Curie temperature. 
For that reason, the two-dimensional Ising model forms the basis of 
almost all our theoretical understanding of the phase transition to the 
ferromagnetic state. 
2. THE ISING MODEL 
The model introduced by Ising1 consists of a lattice of "spin" variables 
σα, which may take on only the values +1 and —1. Any two of these 
"spins" have a mutual interaction energy 
— E(a, 
α')σασα,. 
The meaning of (2.1) is as follows: the mutual interaction energy is 
—E(a, a) when σα and σα· are both +1 or both — 1, but is +E(a, a') in 
the two cases where σα = +1, σα, = — 1 and σα = — 1, σα, = +1. In 
1. E. Ising, Ζ. Physik 31, 253 (1925). Some people prefer to refer to this as the 
Lenz-Ising model because Lenz introduced the model in Physik. Ζ. 21, 613 (1920). 
However, Lenz never computed any of the model's properties. Therefore, we will 
follow the practice of Onsager, Kaufman, and Yang and refer to the model by 
Ising's name alone. 

[3] 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
addition, a spin may interact with an external magnetic field H with an 
energy 
—Ησα. 
(2.2) 
Like (2.1), (2.2) means that the interaction energy is —Hot + Η accord-
ing as the spin oa is +1 or — 1. Throughout this book we will consider 
only the case where E(a, a) vanishes unless the locations a and a are 
nearest neighbors on the lattice. Furthermore, we will restrict ourselves to 
the square lattice, where all the spins σα are situated at the intersections of 
a square grid. These two restrictions are of quite different natures and 
deserve comment. 
In two dimensions, the restriction to nearest-neighbor interactions has 
proved essential if we wish to perform exact calculations valid for all 
temperatures. In one dimension, however, the same remark does not 
apply, and, in fact, explicit computations on the linear Ising chain have 
been carried out with interactions which include several neighbors. More 
important, it has been shown by Dyson2 that, whereas no phase transition 
can exist if all interactions are finite and of finite range, a phase transition 
does exist if the interactions are of infinite range and decrease sufficiently 
slowly as the separation between the spins becomes large. At present 
only the existence of this phase transition has been established, but none 
of its properties have been computed. This one-dimensional work is 
extremely interesting but does not fall within the scope of this book. It 
does, however, lead us to believe that in two dimensions a generalization 
of the interaction to include more than nearest neighbors will change the 
nature of the phase transition qualitatively only if the range of interaction 
is infinite. Because dipole-dipole forces are of long range, this is physi-
cally an interesting topic, but unfortunately nothing is exactly known at 
present. 
There are numerous two-dimensional lattices other than the square 
lattice. For example, the triangular, hexagonal, and decorated lattices 
have all been considered. However, the square lattice is the one which has 
been most thoroughly studied. Furthermore, the existing work on all of 
these lattices has been performed by methods quite closely related to 
those we will develop for the square lattice. Also, with the exception of 
decorated lattices, most of the physical properties of these lattices reveal 
no new phenomena not already exhibited by the square lattice. Con-
sequently, for reasons of concreteness and convenience, we will, with one 
exception in Chapter VIII, not consider these lattices in this book. 
With these restrictions, we may now write the total energy of the two-
dimensional Ising model as

where the first subscript of σ labels the rows and the second subscript 
labels the columns of the square lattice. However, further simplifying 
assumptions on Ex{j, k) and E2(j, k) are still needed if we wish to obtain 
explicit results. Throughout the first thirteen chapters of this book we 
will consider the case first studied by Onsager,3 namely, the case where

depend on j and k. We will refer to the square lattice with these conditions 
on Ex and E2 as Onsager's lattice and write its total energy explicitly as

Onsager's lattice has the property that (ignoring for the moment possible 
complications at the boundary) each site is equivalent to every other site. 
In the last two chapters of this book, the restriction to Onsager's lattice is 
relaxed. Instead, we study lattices where E2(j, k) is allowed to depend on 
j but not k although Ex(j, k) is still independent of both j and k. 
Our definition of the Ising model is still incomplete, because we have 
not yet specified the situation at the boundary. In this book, several 
different choices appear, depending on the physical quantity of interest. 
It must be pointed out that the Ising model is a useful model for several 
physical phenomena other than ferromagnetism. For example, Lee and 
Yang4 have used it to study the liquid-gas transition, and it has also 
proved to be of great value in understanding the order-disorder transition 
of alloys such as /3-brass. However, for the sake of concreteness of 
interpretation and because the considerations of the last three chapters 
do not make physical sense with any other interpretation, we will un-
abashedly think of the Ising model as a ferromagnet.

Statistical Mechanics

The basic simplification in framing the definition of the Ising model of 
the preceding chapter is the choosing of the fundamental variables to be 
the numbers a, k which can be only +1 or —1. Because of this choice 
there can be no terms in the interaction energy which refer to kinetic 
energy or to angular momentum. Consequently, the a j k do not change 
with time and by necessity we must confine ourselves to a study of those 
physical properties which depend only on the distribution of energy levels 
of the system. When the number of energy levels is large, this study 
requires the use of statistical mechanics. Furthermore the energy levels 
of the Ising model are discrete and are bounded below. In this chapter 
we will develop the statistical mechanics needed to study such systems. 
2. M I C R O C A N O N I C A L ENSEMBLE 
A thorough and rigorous development of statistical mechanics in a 
form general enough to apply to all systems of physical interest is a 
difficult job which is outside the scope of this book. Fortunately, we 
avoid some of the mathematical difficulties by restricting our attention to 
systems with discrete energies only. Furthermore we will make the 
additional technical restriction that the discrete energy levels are com-
mensurable. In particular, we assume: (1) that all differences between 
energy levels are integral multiples of some ΔΕ, and (2) that Δ£ is the 
largest of the numbers satisfying (1). For the interaction (2.4) of Chapter 
I with Η — 0 this restriction is equivalent to the requirement that EJE2 
be rational. It is inconceivable that any quantity of physical interest can 

[8] 
T H E T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L I S I N G 
M O D E L 
depend on the existence of ΔΕ and, indeed, ΔΕ will not appear in the 
final form of statistical mechanics which we shall derive. 
Our derivation of statistical mechanics is not going to be logically 
impeccable. To be truly understandable to the physicist we should take 
the laws of mechanics, be they classical or quantum, and compute 
everything from first principles. Unfortunately, this has never been done. 
Anyone who wants to "derive" the laws of statistical mechanics must at 
some point wave his hands, intimidate the reader by appealing either to 
"physical experience" or to "mathematical axioms," and introduce 
some concept beyond the realm of the laws of mechanics. For the moment 
we will follow tradition and introduce these extramechanical assump-
tions. In Sec. 6 we will return to this point and make explicit some of the 
physical phenomena for which this approach is inadequate. 
It is traditional in discussions of statistical mechanics to introduce the 
concept of thermal equilibrium. Strictly speaking, this is an undefined 
(or, perhaps better, multiply defined) concept. In introducing it we try 
by an appeal to our physical intuition to circumnavigate the fact that we 
are not in general able to study the time development of a system with a 
large number of particles. 
One notion of thermal equilibrium is the intuitive feeling that if a 
macroscopic system is prepared and then left isolated for a long period 
of time its macroscopic properties will eventually stop changing and it 
will be in some sort of equilibrium. 
Another notion of equilibrium is embodied in the zeroth law of 
thermodynamics: If system A and system C are in thermal equilibrium 
with each other and system Β and system C are in thermal equilibrium 
with each other, then system A and Β are also in thermal equilibrium with 
each other. In this form the zeroth law is a bit abstract. However, in 
practice it is made concrete by introducing the concept of temperature. 
Indeed, we will use the zeroth law to characterize temperature by saying 
that temperature is a quantity which is the same for all bodies which are 
in thermal equilibrium with each other. 
We will use the word temperature to mean "statistical" temperature. 
On the other hand, once we have used statistical mechanics to give a 
precise definition of the statistical temperature, we will show that it has 
all the properties of the temperature of thermodynamics. In particular, 
we show that the temperatures of two bodies in thermal equilibrium with 
each other are equal. 
By definition it is not possible to speak of the statistical mechanics of 
one isolated Ising model with a finite, and perhaps small, number of sites. 
Therefore we must consider that in some way our Ising model is made 
part of a system which is big enough for statistical concepts to be useful. 
The actual way in which this contact is established and the nature of the 
larger system will be irrelevant as long as the forces which make the 

[9] 
S T A T I S T I C A L 
M E C H A N I C S 
connection are sufficiently weak. To carry out this construction within 
the context of discrete energy levels, we will consider a large number Ν 
of identical Ising models of Μ rows and J f columns connected together 
by infinitely weak forces which allow the Ising models to exchange energy 
but that do not contribute to the total energy of the system. One of the 
Ising models is the system we are interested in; the others will serve to 
define the temperature. Such a collection of systems is called an ensemble. 
We study this ensemble by using the fundamental postulate of the 
statistical mechanics of discrete energy levels: if we know only the total 
energy of an ensemble but do not know the energies of each of the Ising 
models that make it up, then all such distributions of the total energy are 
equally probable. An ensemble with this probability function is called a 
microcanonical ensemble. 
To state this postulate in mathematical form let σ(η) stand for the set 
of variables which specify the nth Ising model and let <?(n)(cr<n)) be the 
energy corresponding to σ(Λ>. Then if the only information we have about 
an ensemble is that its total energy is £tót, the probability that the Ν 
Ising models have the configurations specified by σ α ),..., σ(Ν) is

where Σ»01' indicates a summation over all configurations σ<71) of the »th

3. CANONICAL ENSEMBLE 
Our interest is not in properties of all Ν Ising models but rather in 
the properties of one particular Ising model. We therefore must find the 
probability Ρ(σα>; EMt) that one Ising model (say the first one) is in some 
particular state </" while the rest of the Ising models may be in any state 
subject only to the requirement that istot be constant. This probability is 
exactly computed from (2.1) as

If Ν is small this is the final expression and no further simplification is

possible. We are, however, interested in the limit where N - > oo, which 
corresponds to the physical situation of having our one small Ising 
model connected to an external system or heat bath which has an 
enormous number of degrees of freedom. A collection of Ising models 
with a probability determined by (3.1) in the Ν -»· oo limit is known as a 
canonical ensemble. 
To study (3.1) as N-+co 
we first use the integral representation of 
Kronecker's delta, 
which is valid since (J — j')l&E is an integer, and we write

We will approximately evaluate the integrals in (3.3) and (3.6) when 
N^-oo by the method of steepest descents. 
To carry out this approximation we first show that if 
ζ = β + iy 
(3.2) 
(3.3) 
(3.4) 
(3.5) 
(3.6) 
(3.7) 
and 
AE<y

(3.8) 
then the integrand of (3.3) has its absolute maximum for a given value of 

[11] 
S T A T I S T I C A L 
M E C H A N I C S 
β at y = 0. We demonstrate this by noting that 
I [Ζ(β + iy)Y exp [E™Q3 + iy)] | = \Z(ß + ¿y)|» exp (Ε™β). 
(3.9) 
But 
Ζ(β + iy) = 2 e~<í+,l0íc<'> 
(3.10) 
takes on its maximum absolute value when each term in the sum has

the same phase (modulo 2π). This occurs either when y — 0 or, if y Φ 0, 
when y is such that for all configurations 
y\ß(o) - <?(σ0)] = Ίττ (integer), 
where σ0 is some arbitrary fixed configuration. However, we have defined 
ΔΕ to be the largest number such that [¿"(σ) — #(σ·0)]/Δ£ is an integer for 
all σ and σ0. Therefore any y φ 0 which satisfies (3.11) must have a 
magnitude which is at least as big as 2π/Δ£, which violates (3.8). 
The number of energy levels in an Ising model is 2numberotsltM. There-
fore, the function Ζ(ζ) is a finite sum of analytic functions and therefore is 
an analytic function itself. This means that the integrands in (3.3) and 
(3.6) are analytic functions and hence the path of integration may be de-
formed away from the imaginary ζ axis without altering the value of the 
integral. Furthermore, these integrals are obviously periodic functions of 
ζ with period 2πί\ΔΕ. Therefore if we deform the path of integration as 
shown in Fig. 2.1 the contributions from the two parts of the path that are 
parallel to the real axis cancel because the integrands are equal but the 
directions of integration are opposite. Thus in (3.3) and (3.6) we can 
replace ζ by β + iy and integrate the variable y from —n¡AE to π/ΔΕ. 
The method of steepest descents consists in choosing β so that as 
oo 
the only important contributions to the integrals come from the region 
very close to y = 0.

Consider first Ω^Ε101). Because E M is proportional to Ν we define 
E = E™¡N 
(3.12) 
and write the integrand of (3.3) as 
exp Ν{ζΕ + In Z(£)}. 
(3.13) 
Consider an expansion of the term in braces into a power series about 
some point ζ0 so that

If we try to integrate this approximation along the contour Re ζ = ζ0 for 
large Ν the term containing Ν(ζ — ζ0)2 will cause contributions to the 
integral from that part of the contour where |ζ — £0'| » N ' 1 1 2 to be 
negligible. However, when |£ — ζ0| » Ν ' 1 the term which is propor-
tional to Ν(ζ — ¿o) oscillates violently. Since TV-1 « N'112, 
there will be 
an enormous number of oscillations from this first term in the region 
where e"'c_to)2 is close to 1, These rapid oscillations tend to cancel each 
other out and make a direct estimation of the integral extremely difficult. 
However, we avoid this problem if we choose ζ0 so that the coefficient of 
Ν(ζ — ίο) vanishes. Therefore we shift the contour of integration to 
ζ = β + iy, where y is real and β satisfies 
£ = - ^ l n Z ( j S ) . 
(3.15) 
When β is determined from this equation Ζ(β) is called the partition 
function. 
With this contour of integration it is straightforward to obtain an 
approximate evaluation of iliE101) by expanding the integrand in (3.3) 
about y = 0. To justify this procedure we must show that there is no 
more than one value of β that satisfies (3.15). 
This will be the case if we prove that (d/dß) In Z(ß) is a monotonie 
function of β when β is real and, since (δ/δ/8) In Z(β) is a continuous 
function of β for real β, this monotonicity will follow if 
ψΙηΖ(β)>0.

(3.22) 
Essentially the same procedure may be used to evaluate the expression 
for Σσ'" • • · Σ*"" δι«*,«, in (3.6). The only remark which is needed is 
that for our steepest-descents evaluation to be accurate we do not really 
need the coefficient of Ν(ζ — ζ0) in (3.14) to be identically zero but 
merely need it small enough so that the number of oscillations this 
linear term contributes in the region where the quadratic term e(1'2>"«-W2 
is of order 1 will not become enormous as N-*· oo. This requirement, 
besides being satisfied if the coefficient of ζ — ζ0 is zero, will also be 
satisfied if that coefficient is 0(N'm) 
as JV-> oo. 
We use this remark to evaluate (3.6) by noting that if we followed the 
previous procedure we would expand the integrand about the point

ζ = β', where β' is determined from

(3.23) 
Clearly β — β' = 0(N~l), 
so the foregoing remark indicates that we 
may just as well expand about β (which is independent of σ(1)) as about 
β'. We therefore use (3.15) and expand 
ζ[ΝΕ - ¿V 1')] + (Ν - 1) In Z(ζ)

This is the probability function of systems in a canonical ensemble. The 
minimum level spacing ΔΕ no longer appears and the entire effect of 
the large system to which this Ising model is connected is contained in the 
parameter β. 
From the probability function (3.29) we may study any property / of 
the Ising model that depends on the variables σα). In particular we may 
compute the probability Pr(f) that the property / has the value /. How-
ever, when the number of sites J t J f of the Ising model becomes large 
we will see that Pf(f) 
is often very sharply peaked about one particular 
value of /. In such a case a measurement off on any one Ising model will 
almost certainly correspond with the average value which would be 
obtained if we measured /on many identical Ising models each described 
by (3.29). Therefore for Ising models with J ( rows and J f columns we 
often will be content to study only such average values, which we denote 
a s ( f } j t . j r and compute from (3.29) as

multiples of ΔΕ. As before, if there is one such AE there is an infinite

Equations (3.36) and (3.38) are valid as they stand if NJN2 is fixed. They 
are also valid if (say) N1 is fixed (while N2

panded as a power series in N1IN2. Therefore one Ising model of type j 
obeys the canonical ensemble probability function

where β is independent of j. In other words, β is a parameter which is 
meaningful only when the number of systems is large and which is the 
same for two (or many) ensembles of systems with discrete mutually 
commensurable energy levels which are in thermal equilibrium with each 
other. In fact, as one expects, the restriction to discrete mutually com-
mensurable energy levels is not necessary for the conclusion and β is 
indeed the same for all systems which are in thermal equilibrium with 
each other. Therefore β has the property of temperature required by the 
zeroth law of thermodynamics as discussed in the previous section. 
The quantity β itself is not called temperature. When β -*• oo it is easily 
seen from (3.5) that 
Ζ ~ g-^min χ multiplicity of £mln, 
(3.40) 
where <fmlI1 is the minimum energy the system may attain. It is customary 
to associate Τ = 0 with this minimum energy. Therefore, the temperature 
T, which is measured in Kelvin degrees, is defined as 
ι 

[18] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
where k is called Boltzmann's constant. With this definition the well-
known ideal gas can be shown to obey the equation 
PV = NkT, 
(3.42) 
where Ρ is the pressure, V is the volume, and Ν is the number of mole-
cules. Real gases obey this equation to a good approximation at low 
enough densities, so in principle we could often measure Τ by using a gas 
as a thermometer. If we then use such an ideal-gas thermometer to 
measure at sea-level pressure the temperatures at which water freezes and 
boils and arbitrarily define a degree on the Kelvin scale so that the 
difference between these two temperatures is 100 degrees, we empirically 
find that 
k = 1.38 χ 10"le erg/degree. 
(3.43) 
4. T H E R M O D Y N A M I C S 
The probability distribution of the canonical ensemble allows us to 
study the properties of an Ising model in thermal equilibrium. Though in 
principle it is possible to define many properties of an Ising model, in 
practice only a few properties are of direct physical interest. In addition 
to E, the internal energy, the properties of magnetic systems which are of 
greatest physical interest are the magnetization, heat capacity, entropy, 
and Helmholtz free energy. These quantities are not all independent but 
are related by the laws of thermodynamics. For the sake of concreteness 
it is useful to define these properties and exhibit their general inter-
relations before embarking upon their detailed calculation. 
Heat may be defined as that work which is done on a system by those 
forces which are ignored in the interaction energy but which couple the 
system to the external system that defines the temperature. Therefore if 
we fix H, so that Tis the only variable, the change in heat δ β is related to 
a change dE in the internal energy as 
dE = SQ. 
(4.1) 
In particular, E may be changed by changing the temperature so that 
SQ

dT 
(4.2) 
where the notation \x indicates the variables which are held constant 
during the partial differentiation. Measurements of (δβ/δΓ)| ί Η_ 0 are 
some of the most common thermal measurements. Thus we define C, the 
heat capacity at constant magnetic field, as 

ti 9] 
STATISTICAL 
M E C H A N I C S 
(This heat capacity is sometimes written as CH to emphasize that H is 
held constant. It is to be distinguished from CM, which refers to a measure-
ment of 8QI8T in which the magnetization is held constant. In this book 
CM will never be discussed.) 
The total spin of any Ising model is 
Σσ'·«· 
(4-4) 
l.k 
Accordingly, the average total magnetization of an Ising model of J ( 
rows and ~V columns in the canonical ensemble is (from 3.30) 
Therefore if we consider a collection of identical Ising models each of 
which is in equilibrium at temperature T, and then thermally isolate them 
and change the external magnetic field from Η to Η + dH, the work 
done per Ising model will be 
dE = — M dH. 
(4.6) 
For the Ising model the only external forces which are considered are 
that of the external magnetic field and the forces that connect the Ising 
model to the external heat bath. Therefore, if the Ising model is con-
nected to the external heat bath (i.e. not thermally isolated) and if the 
magnetic field is allowed to change we may combine (4.1) and (4.6) to 
find that the total change in internal energy is 
dE = 8Q — M dH. 
(4.7) 
This is the first law of thermodynamics. 
For our microcanonical ensemble of Ν identical Ising models and total 
energy Elot the entropy S"' may be defined as k times the logarithm of 
the number of ways in which the total energy may be distributed among 
the Ν Ising models. In other words, 
S™ = k In ü(£tot). 
(4.8) 
When 
oo we see from (3.22) that 
S«*lk = N[ßE + In Z(β)] - i In Ν + In Δ£ + 0(1). 
(4.9) 
Therefore, we define S, the entropy per Ising model, as 
S = lim SMIN, 
(4.10)

so that as N-+co 
S = k[ßE + In Z(ß)].

To define temperature precisely we have considered the limit where N, 
the number of identical models in the microcanonical ensemble, goes to 
infinity. In the remainder of this book this Ν o o limit will always be 
taken (and, accordingly, the number of identical models in the micro-
canonical ensemble will never be mentioned again). However, the number 
J ( of rows and J f of columns in each individual Ising model has been 
kept fixed and finite. For example, consider the case J ( = 1 and JT = 1, 
where one Ising spin is in thermal equilibrium with an external system at 
temperature T. In any measurement the energy of this spin can be either 
+ Η or —H. The partition function is 
Ζ(β) = e-"" + e*" = 2 cosh βΗ 
(5.1) 
and the Helmholtz free energy is 
A=-ß-1\n2coshßH. 
(5.2) 
Therefore the average total energy is 
E = -HtaahßH, 
(5.3) 
which is quite different from + Η or —H. Similarly, any measurement of 
the spin can be only +1 or — 1. However, from (4.22) and (5.2), 
M = tanh β Η. 
(5.4) 
Again in this very small Ising model the average value computed from 
the canonical ensemble is quite different from the result of any one 
measurement.

In actual practice, of course, we are never interested in one isolated 
spin but rather are interested in macroscopic systems of ~ 1023 interacting 
spins. As mentioned in Chapter I, the most distinctive features of statisti-
cal mechanics arise precisely because the system under consideration has 
such an enormous number of particles. Therefore we are most interested 
in the Ising model in the case Μ -*• oo and J f 
oo. When J f J f is large, 
the total average magnetization, the total average energy, and the 
Helmholtz free energy will in general be proportional to JÍJT. Therefore, 
one aspect of the investigation of large Ising models is to divide these 
quantities by J Í J Í and let J Í 
oo and ^"->00. This limit is called the 
thermodynamic limit. We therefore define : 
(1) the free energy per spin (or more simply the free energy), 
F = lim A\JCJf

The special case Μ = 1 and JT — 1 illustrates a general feature of 
small systems, namely, that one measurement of a quantity such as the 
energy or the magnetization may differ substantially from its average 
computed in the canonical ensemble. To see that this is not the case when 
M J f is large, consider the fluctuations in the average energy, one measure 
of which is 
- 1 [ < < ^ 2 > - E=]. Since 
Σ ¿ ( σ ) β - " Μ

we may differentiate both sides with respect to —β and obtain

which means that as J¿¿V

per spin will with probability 1 yield the value u. It is important to re-
mark, however, that the specific heat as defined by (5.9) does not have to 
exist for all temperatures and magnetic fields. At those temperatures 
where it does not exist the left-hand side of (5.15) will still, in general, 
vanish as 
oo but it will not vanish as rapidly as { J t J i y 1 . 
In a similar fashion we may consider fluctuations in the magnetization 
per spin, which may be measured in terms of

when J f J f is large and so in this case a measurement of the magnetization 
per spin will almost certainly yield M. However, as was the case with the 
specific heat, there is no reason that χ must exist for all Τ and H. 
The mathematical significance of the thermodynamic limit may be 
seen by examining the partition function 
When J t and JT are finite, this partition function is a sum of a finite 
number of analytic functions of β and H, and therefore Ζ(β) must be 
analytic. Furthermore, when β is positive and Η is real, Ζ(β) is a finite 
sum of positive numbers and hence is positive. Moreover, when J i and 
JT are finite Ζ(β) must be nonzero for some region where β is sufficiently 
close to the positive real axis and Η is sufficiently close to the real axis. 
Therefore In Ζ(β) must be an analytic function of β and Η in this region 
and so must all properties derivable from In Ζ{β) by differentiation. 
However, when J Í -> oo and J f -*• oo, the sum involved in Z(β) contains 
an infinite number of terms. The position of zeros of Ζ(β) may converge to 
the positive β or real Η axis and so in this limit F does not have to be an 
analytic function of β and Η for β positive and Η real.1 These new 
analyticity properties of F correspond to qualitative features that appear 
in the thermodynamic limit which are not possible in a system with a 
finite number of particles. These analytic properties are intimately related 
to the physical notion of phase transition. The major reason for studying 
the two-dimensional Ising model is to attempt to make this connection 
more precise. 
The interaction energy of the Ising model with H = 0 has a sym-
metry such that if we change all spins into their negatives the interaction 
energy is unchanged. Therefore neither spin up nor spin down is pre-
ferred. In particular, 
Furthermore, if Η φ 0 and if we send Η 
— Η and all spins into their

It is also simple to prove that

if H > 0.

from which (5.23) follows. 
If Jt and JT are finite, M(H), which is derivable from In Ζ(β) by 
differentiation, must be an analytic function of all real Η for all positive 
ß. In particular, M(H) will be a continuous function of Η at Η = 0 for 
all T, so that in addition to (5.21) we have 
lim M(H) = 0. 
(5.26) 
H-0 
Now consider the thermodynamic limit. In this limit (5.22) continues 
to hold, so we have 
M ( H ) = - M ( - H ) . 
(5.27) 
However, after the thermodynamic limit is taken M(H) does not have to 
be analytic at Η = 0 for all T. In particular, M(H) does not have to be 
continuous at Η = 0 and we have

We define M(0+) as the spontaneous magnetization and call the tem-
perature at which M(0+) first becomes positive as Τ is decreased from 
infinity the critical temperature Tc.2 
Since analyticity in Τ at Η = 0 breaks down for M at Tc, it is most 
2. The question can be asked whether the free energy of an Ising model can fail 
to be analytic in Τ or Η at a value of Η other than zero. That this does not happen 
if all interaction energies are non-negative is proved by T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang, 
Phys.

interesting to investigate the analyticity properties of the specific heat c 
as a function of temperature at H — 0. In the finite case, of course, the 
heat capacity C must be analytic and hence finite at all temperatures. 
However, in the thermodynamic limit, c at H = 0 does not have to be an 
analytic function of Tat all T, and, indeed, we shall find that in Onsager's 
lattice C is infinite at TC. 
In order to gain insight into the microscopic behavior of the Ising 
model, and especially into the peculiar behaviors of M and c that may 
occur at TC, it is most useful to study the spin-spin correlation functions

In Section 2 we gave two distinct definitions of thermal equilibrium; 
one defined equilibrium as the state to which a system will tend when it has 
been allowed to sit undisturbed for a long while, and the other defined it 
in terms of the zeroth law of thermodynamics. The statistical mechanics 
developed in Sections 2 and 3 was shown to describe an equilibrium 
system in the sense of the second definition. To be totally convincing, it 
would be most desirable to prove that this statistical mechanics also 
describes a system which is in equilibrium in the first sense as well. To 
be more specific, one would like to prove that, if we begin at time zero 
with a large number of systems with identical Hamiltonians but different 
initial conditions, and if we vary at will for some finite amount of time 
the parameters in this Hamiltonian referring to such things as external 
electric and magnetic fields, then as time becomes sufficiently large the 
possible states of this collection of systems should approach the distribu-
tion of the canonical (or microcanonical) ensemble. More weakly, we 
might be satisfied if we could prove such a theorem when the initial 
distribution of states was in some sense "close" to the equilibrium 
distribution of states. Unfortunately, without further restrictions on the 
Hamiltonian such a theorem is not true because there exists an explicit 
example of a Hamiltonian for which we may begin with a collection of 
systems with the distribution of the canonical ensemble, vary an ex-
ternal magnetic field, and discover that as time goes to infinity the 
systems do not return to the distribution of a canonical ensemble. It 
would be most desirable to know what conditions must be imposed on 
the Hamiltonian of a system so as to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon. 
It must be realized that, even if we can overcome this objection to 
statistical mechanics, there still exist limitations to the statistical me-

chanics presented here. The removal of this objection would merely say 
that in the limit as t -> oo we could describe a system by use of statistical 
mechanics. However, unless we know how fast this t —>• oo limit is 
approached, the theorem that removes the objection would be useless 
from a practical point of view. After all, a thermal equilibrium which 
requires 1023 years to reach is of little use to the average physicist. This 
question of the time it takes to achieve thermal equilibrium is most 
important because there do, in fact, exist many cases in which the 
statistical mechanics we have previously discussed does not apply. For 
example, the properties of a piece of glass depend not only on the 
material it is made out of but also on the manner in which these materials 
are heated and cooled. The very property of being a glass or of being a 
crystallized solid depends on the thermal history of the system. If the 
physical properties of a collection of atoms depend upon their past 
thermal history, this collection obviously cannot be expected to be 
described by our statistical mechanics. If one waits long enough, 
presumably the glass will crystallize and the final state can be described 
by the canonical ensemble. However, it is clearly desirable to extend 
statistical mechanics to deal with the system which actually confronts us 
at finite time. 
Problems similar to that of glass cannot be ignored in dealing with 
magnetism because the familiar phenomena of hysteresis cannot be 
treated on the basis of the (micro) canonical ensemble above. To deal 
with these phenomena we need some extension of the basic postulate of 
Section 2. Although no general theory of such extensions exists, these 
problems are often studied by restricting the sum over all states which 
occurs in the partition function to an appropriately chosen subset. This 
assumes that there exists a time scale in which it is extremely improbable 
that the system can fluctuate out of this subset of states. Such a treatment 
is vague because, aside from questions related to the time scale, there is 
usually no unambiguous way of specifying which states are in the subset. 
Since there is no dynamics in the Ising model, we cannot possibly study 
problems related to time scales. However, within the context of the Ising 
model, there does exist a type of hysteresis behavior for which the 
specification of the subset of states can be made completely precise. This 
phenomenon will be studied in Chapter XIII. 
To conclude this chapter it is important to emphasize that our develop-
ment of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics has been based on an 
important and unphysical assumption, namely, that the interaction 
energy of the system is completely known. Experimentally this assump-
tion is never correct. The exact chemical composition of a substance is 
never exactly known. Even if it were, one would still not know the 
spatial arrangement of the atoms unless, for example, the lattice were a 
pure perfectly periodic lattice which, although sometimes a good approxi-

T H E T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L I S I N G 
M O D E L 
mation, is in fact never the case. If statistical mechanics is to be a truly 
useful tool for the analysis of real experiments it must be possible to show 
that in some sense almost all interaction energies consistent with our 
imperfect knowledge of the experimental situation will lead to the same 
free energy in the thermodynamic limit. We will return to this important 
practical question in Chapters XIV and XV and show that it is indeed 
true that, if the interaction energies E2(j) of the Ising model are not 
exactly known but are allowed to be independent random variables 
described by a known probability distribution P(E2), then the free 
energies of all Ising models that are described by P(E2) will, with 
probability 1, have the same free energy in the thermodynamic limit. 
However, this free energy is not the same as the free energy of any 
Onsager lattice and in the last two chapters we will see in a precise fashion 
that even a very small amount of randomness will, if we consider tem-
peratures sufficiently close to the critical temperature, cause physically 
observable properties such as the specific heat to have enormous devia-
tions from the behavior they would have in any Onsager lattice. It is 
gratifying that this effect has been experimentally observed.

The One-Dimensional Ising Model 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 
There is an enormous difference between the one-dimensional and 
two-dimensional Ising models. In one dimension an Ising model with 
nearest-neighbor forces does not possess a phase transition, whereas in 
two dimensions it does. The primary goal of this book is to study the 
phase transition in two dimensions as explicitly as possible. However, that 
study is long and is complicated by the fact that for many quantities of 
interest closed-form answers are not available and we must be content 
with appropriate approximations. Therefore, before commencing the 
study of the two-dimensional Ising model it is useful to study the one-
dimensional model where both the free energy and the spin-spin correla-
tion function may be exactly computed in closed form in the presence of 
a magnetic field.1 
In a one-dimensional lattice with Jf spins we consider the interaction 
energy given by (1.2.4) with j = 1 and 1 < k < J f . However, to complete 
the specification of the system we need to state precisely what are the 
interactions of the spins 1 and Jf at the two ends. There are two common 
ways of treating these end spins. 
(1) Cyclic. 
We consider the one-dimensional lattice deformed into a 
circle and join site 1 and site Jf by a bond of strength Εγ. Then the 
interaction energy is 
¿c = —-El 2 
akak + l — Η 2 
"k, 
k = 1 
k = l 
where

We may also consider the more natural arrangement in 
which spin 1 interacts only with H and with spin 2 and spin Jf interacts 
only with H and with spin Jf — 1. Then the interaction energy is

We will treat both types of boundary conditions in this chapter not 
only to show that they both have the same free energy (per site) in the 
limit Jf 
oo but also to see for systems of finite size how large Jf must 
be before the boundary conditions may safely be ignored. 
Though the distinction between these two types of boundary conditions 
is in general clear, the case Jf — 2 is slightly peculiar, since if E1 is the 
bond between the two spins with the free end conditions we may obtain 
all properties of the cyclic case merely by replacing Ex by 2E1. In par-
ticular, for free boundary conditions there are only four possible states 
of the system and it is elementary to find

Consider the spins ak and a k + 1 together. If ak = ak+1, these spins give a 
contribution —E^ to the interaction energy, whereas if ok = — a k + u they 
give a contribution of +Ey. Furthermore, with this pair of spins we as-
sociate the energy

take on be the basis of a two-dimensional vector space and in this space 
define the matrix Ρ by 
<σ|Ρ|σ'> = exp {βΙΕ,σσ' + \Η{σ + σ')]}, 
(2.3) 
the vector V by 
<σ| Vy = e6H"12,

THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL ISING

and 
Z ï > = 2[2 cosh ß E ^ - K 
(2.16) 
These expressions have two interesting features which will reappear in 
our discussion of the two-dimensional model. First of all, we note that 
is an even function of Eu whereas ZC
1¡A- is an even function of Ex if 
Jf is even but possesses no such symmetry if Jf is odd. These features 
may be readily understood by considering the interaction energies $¥ and 
Sc of (1.1) and (1.2) with H = 0. If in (1.2) we make the replacement 
(2.17) 
then 
+ 
-EJ. 
(2.18) 
Since 
is a summation of e~Mr(,7;Ei> over all states, (2.18) guarantees 
that Z l t j r will be an even function of E^ Consider next S„ given by (1.1). 
If we make the substitution (2.17) we see that 
*lo\ Ex) = *¿o>; -EJ 
+ [1 - (-ΐησ,σ^. 
(2.19) 
If Jf is even, 1 — (— 1)-^ vanishes and (2.19) guarantees that Z{,jr will be 
an even function of Ex. 
The second feature of (2.15) and (2.16) to be noted is their Τ-*• 0 limit. 
As T-*-0, 
-*• 2eBlEilur~1\ 
(2.20) 
This limit is in accord with the right-hand side of (1.13) since 
= 
(2-21) 
and the degeneracy of this state is 2. However, the Γ-> 0 limit of ZJ,^ is 
slightly more complicated. If Ελ > 0 or if 
< 0 and JV is even, then 
(2.22) 
When 
< 0 and J f is odd, then 
2jVeB[E^ur~ 2'. 
(2.23) 
The difference between these two cases is related to the behavior of Sc 
under the substitution (2.17) which is shown in (2.19). It can perhaps be 
best seen in Fig. 3.1. When Ex < 0 and Jf is even, 
has the two ground 
states shown there. However, when E1 < 0 and Jf is odd, the regular 
alternation of spins in the ground state which is possible when Jf is even 
must be broken at one bond. At this bond the two neighboring spins must 
both point either up or down. Since the mismatched bond can be any of 
the Jf bonds in the ring, the degeneracy of this ground state is U f . The 
bond at which the mismatch occurs is called the " antiferromagnetic

so that, as expected in the thermodynamic limit, the free energy per spin

boundary conditions are the same. 
The approach of jV'1 
In Z1¡t/y to this

on the boundary conditions. From (2.13) we find that for large JT

Therefore

while

Jf~1. 
We may interpret this difference as follows. First note that the second 
term in (2.27) is proportional to the number of free spins at the ends of the 
lattice. Because this term is lacking in (2.26) we identify — 
times 
the second term in (2.27) as an additional free energy of a free end.

We therefore expect that, as long as a sample is large enough that its 
"surface"-to-"volume" ratio may be neglected, boundary conditions be-
come unimportant for the computation of physical properties derivable 
from the free energy.

It is clear from the definition that if J f is finite both

analytic functions of β and Η for all β and H. However, we see explicitly 
from (2.27) that in the limit J f -*• oo there are values of β and Η where

The existence of this limiting value is independent of the sign of Ex. 
However, it is easily seen from (2.10) that the approach to this limit is 
monotonie if E1 > 0. If Ex < 0 the approach is oscillatory. In general the 
value of <σΝ.σΝ}° for Ex < 0 is not simply expressible in terms of <σλ.,σΛ.)° 
with Ex replaced by — Ex. However, in the special case Η = 0 we easily 
see that 
<σ.ν-σ,ν>' = (tanh

(3.9) 
This is precisely the relation expected from the behavior (2.18) of 
under the substitution (2.17). 
In (5.41) of the previous chapter we defined the long-range order as the 
limit when Ν — Ν' - > oo of (σΝ·σΝ} 
evaluated at Η = 0. From (3.8) we 
see that the long-range order so defined is 1 if Τ = 0 and zero otherwise. 
This absence of long-range order at Τ > 0 has a simple explanation. From 
(3.9) we may restrict our considerations to Ex > 0. When Τ = 0 the 
system must be in its lowest energy state and all spins point in the same 
direction. Therefore <σ0σν) = 1. However, if we let Τ > 0 then not only 
is the lowest energy state important for the computation of <σ0σν> but 
so are the low-lying excited states. But, because of the one-dimensional 
nature of this system, if we overturn one spin to put the system in its first 
excited state we may then overturn one of its nearest neighbors with no 
additional cost in energy. Indeed, the first excited state is 
— 1)-

fold degenerate. The states contributing to this degenerate level consist of 
all ways that the one-dimensional chain may be broken up into two blocks 
of spins with the spins in one block all pointing up and the spins in the 
other all pointing down. Because of this large degeneracy this first excited 
state has none of the order possessed by the 2-fold degenerate ground 
state and hence, for Τ > 0, <σ0σΝ) must be zero. 
The case of free boundary conditions is treated in a similar fashion. By

THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
This correlation function is an enormous mess when compared with 
the much simpler expression (3.4) obtained for the lattice with cyclic 
boundary conditions. In fact, it is to avoid such complicated expressions 
that cyclic boundary conditions are often imposed in statistical mechani-
cal problems. However, there are several features of this result which will 
reappear in our later work on boundary effects in the two-dimensional 
lattice. In particular, we note that (3.12) does not depend on Ν — Ν' 
alone but on Ν and N' separately. Therefore there are several ways to 
take the thermodynamic limit. One possible way is to keep Ν and N' 
fixed and let Jf -> oo. In this limit we are observing the correlation of 
two spins each of which is a finite distance from the free boundary. 
From (3.12) we explicitly obtain 
= (sinh2 ßH + e-w^-Hsinh 2 β Η + e"« Ei (λ_/λ+)"-Β' 
- 4sinh 2£#e-« £i sinh2
 J8£'1[(A_/À+)W'-1 - (λ_/λ+)""1]}. 
(3.13) 
However, we may also consider the limit where not only does Jf 
oo 
but also N-> oo, N' 
oo, Jf — ΛΓ-> oo, and Jf — N' 
oo. We refer 
to this limit as the bulk limit, because the two spins to be correlated are 
infinitely far from the boundary, and find 
lim <σΝ.σΝ)" = (sinh2 ßH + e-^VpHsinh 2 ßH + 
(3.14) 
bulk 
This limit may be obtained from (3.13) by letting Ν 
oo and N' -> oo 
while keeping Ν — Ν' fixed. It also is identical with the expression (3.5) 
for <oN-oNy. We therefore are led to expect that if we are interested only 
in bulk properties of the Ising model it is immaterial what boundary 
conditions we apply. In later chapters we will study the two-dimensional 
Ising model under several different boundary conditions and explicitly 
verify this conclusion. 
If bulk properties of any statistical mechanical model in the thermo-
dynamic limit do depend on the boundary conditions, then the distinction 
between bulk and surface can no longer be sharply made. While we will 
not be concerned with such problems in this book, it should be remarked 
that such difficulties can arise if the forces between particles approach 
zero sufficiently slowly as the separation between spins becomes infinite. 
In such cases a discussion of macroscopic properties in terms of a free 
energy such as that defined by (II.5.5) is inadequate.

The matrix method of the previous chapter allowed us to compute the 
partition function and the spin-spin correlation functions of a one-
dimensional Ising model in a very elementary fashion. Accordingly, the 
most natural way to study the two-dimensional Ising model would be to 
generalize that procedure to study Ising models of more than one row. 
One could then hope to study the case of a plane of Ising spins by letting 
the number of rows tend to infinity. Indeed, this is precisely the procedure 
followed by Onsager1 in 1944. However, the mathematics of this pro-
cedure is extremely complicated. In order to obtain a simple method of 
computing the partition function of Onsager's lattice we will use instead 
the method of Kasteleyn,2 who many years after Onsager's original 
computation discovered that the partition function of the two-dimensional 
Ising model with Η = 0 is intimately related to a combinatorial problem 
involving dimers. This problem has an extremely elegant solution in terms 
of Pfaffians of matrices which may be easily evaluated. We will devote this 
chapter to the exposition and solution of this dimer problem. In so doing 
we will introduce all of the mathematical tools needed for the computa-
tion of the partition function at Η = 0 of Onsager's two-dimensional 
Ising model. 
A dimer is a figure that may be drawn on a lattice and that covers two 
nearest-neighbor sites and the bond that joins them. Consider the bonds

2. P. W. Kasteleyn, J. Math. Phys. 4, 287 (1963). This paper relates the Ising 
problem to the dimer problem previously solved in detail by P. W. Kasteleyn, 
Physica 27, 1209 (1961). The solution of this dimer problem was also communicated 
by Η. Ν. V. Temperley and Μ. E. Fisher, Phil. Mag. 6, 1061 (1961).

is square, the bonds may be horizontal and vertical—and let 
g(Ni, N2,..., 
Nn) be the number of ways we may completely cover all 
sites of the lattice with dimers such that there are Νχ dimers covering 
bonds of class 1, N2 dimers covering bonds of class 2, and so on, with the 
restriction that only one dimer may occupy any one site. For example, 
there may be two classes where 
= the number of horizontal bonds and 
N2 — the number of vertical bonds. One such dimer covering is shown in 
Fig. 4.1. In this chapter we will be interested in the square lattice of M

the lattice is to be completely filled with dimers, we will require J/" to be

To complete the specification of this dimer problem we need to state 
the boundary conditions of the lattice. In the one-dimensional problems 
of the previous chapter we considered two different boundary conditions, 
free and cyclic. For the two-dimensional problems in this book we will 
consider three boundary conditions: (1) free in both the horizontal and 
vertical directions, (2) free in one direction but cyclic in the other (that 
is, the lattice is wrapped on a cylinder) and (3) cyclic in both directions 
(that is, the lattice is wrapped on a torus). The principal results of this 
chapter are to show that if the lattice has either free or cylindrical 
boundary conditions we may find an antisymmetric matrix A such that 
Ζ = Pf A, 
where Pf A indicates the Pfaflian of A (to be explained in detail in the next 
section) and that if the lattice has toroidal boundary conditions Ζ is 
equal to a linear combination of four Pfaffians. In order to do this we will

devote the next section to a definition of the Pfaffian and the derivation 
of some of its most important properties. In the remaining sections we 
will then use these properties to evaluate the Pfaffian and explicitly 
evaluate Ζ in terms of integrals in the limit M -*• co, Jf -> oo. 
In this chapter we present a complete discussion of these topics includ-
ing all of the fine points connected with ± signs that are related to 
boundary conditions. To our knowledge such a discussion has never 
appeared in the literature. Since the result of this discussion is to show 
that none of these fine points causes any trouble, they may safely be 
ignored for the purpose of understanding the rest of the book. They are 
included for the dedicated, as opposed to the interested, reader.3

P2m-1 < P2m +1

and Sp, the parity of the permutation, is +1 if the permutation ρ is made 
up of an even number of transpositions and — 1 if ρ is made up of an odd

particular, ρt must always be 1 but p2 may take on any of the remaining

but Pi may take on any of the remaining 2Ν — 3 values. Continuing in 
this fashion we find that the number of terms in the Pfaffian of a 2Ν χ 2Ν

acquainted with the elementary properties of matrices and determinants,

(det A)112 and demonstrating that it may be written as Pf A. 
To obtain (2.7) we first prove a theorem known as Jacobi's theorem.

We further define AJK¡M

antisymmetric matrices of odd dimensions and hence vanish. Jacobi's

proves that (det A)112 is not just a rational function of ajk but is a poly-

S(p'p) = ±'S(p).

Pi < Pa,Pa < Pi,·· -,Pjur-1 
< Pjvr, 
(3·4α) 
and 
Pi < Pa < Ps · · · < Pjtjr-i• 
(3-4b) 
Suppose we let the nonzero elements of a(/>i,/>a) be 
a(j>i, Pa) = zi, 
(3.5) 
where pi < p2 and />! and p2 are connected by a bond of class i. In 
particular, if the classes of bonds are vertical and horizontal, zx refers to 
horizontal bonds and z2 refers to vertical bonds. We then may write the 
generating function for closest-packed dimer configurations as 
ZJijr 
= 2 ' α(Ρι> P2MP3, PÙ ··· 
PJUT), 
(3.6) 
P 
where the summation is over all permutations satisfying (3.4). Such an 
expression is called a Hafnian, but, unfortunately, when J ( and J f are 
large there is no efficient way to evaluate such objects. We note, however, 
that because the restrictions (3.4) are exactly the same as the restrictions 
(2.3), (3.6) would be a Pfaffian if in each term we included a factor δρ. 
Therefore if we let the nonzero elements of a(pu p2) satisfy 
a(Pi, p2) = s(pu p2)z, 
(3.7) 
with |í(/>!, p2)\ = 1, where py < p2 and p¡_ and p2 are connected by a 
bond of class i, and if we can choose s(plt p2) so as to cancel out the factor 
Sp that occurs in the definition of the Pfaffian, then Z^^ 
would equal 
Pf AF. This is extremely useful because by (2.7) the Pfaffian is related to 
the determinant of the associated antisymmetric matrix and this de-
terminant may be efficiently studied when J t and J/~ are large. 
The rest of this section is devoted to showing that such a set of values 
for s(pi, p2) can be found. For concreteness we concentrate on the square 
lattice with two classes of bonds, vertical and horizontal. In this case our 
final result is that 
Z ^ 
= Pf A„

The arguments used, however, will be general enough to apply to any 
lattice with free boundary conditions and any number of classes provided 
the lattice may be drawn in a plane with no overlap of bonds. These 
lattices will be referred to as planar. 
Our method of verifying (3.8) and (3.9) consists in giving geometric 
interpretations to Bp and s(px, p2) and then proving some geometric 
theorems. 
We first note that to verify (3.8) and (3.9) it is sufficient to show that 
s(pi, p2) can be chosen such that if pa) and p(2) are any two permutations 
satisfying (2.3) then

However, the restriction (2.3) is somewhat awkward. Therefore, it is 
useful to note that, if we let ρ be any one of the 
! permuta-
tions which, by violating (2.3), may be obtained from a given permutation 
ρ that satisfies (2.3), then, as seen in (2.1), (3.10) will hold if we can find 
one such pa) and pm such that

computed from geometric considerations. 
Consider any two arrangements of dimers specified by the permutations

dimers of p(2) as solid lines. The resulting set of figures is referred to as a 
transition graph (Fig. 4.3). Then, because any lattice point is the end-

point of one and only one line of each type of dimer, the figures in the 
transition graph will consist of: (1) two sites connected by a dotted and 
by a solid line (these figures are called double bonds), and (2) closed 
polygons with an even number of bonds in which the dotted and solid 
lines alternate. We call these closed polygons transition cycles because 
if the bonds of pai are permuted clockwise or counterclockwise one step 
around this cycle they go over to the bonds of p(2). Consider first two 
permutations that differ from one another by only one transition cycle.

Clearly the shift from pw to p'2) is a cyclic permutation of one step of an

positions. Accordingly, if there is only one transition cycle,

We could attempt to satisfy (3.15) with complex s(p1,p2). 
Indeed, if 
one wants to construct a matrix A which has the property that

(3.16) 
it is mandatory that s(pu p2) be complex. However, to obtain the most 
direct geometric interpretation of s(plf p2) we must restrict s(plt p2) to 
take on only the values ± 1. As this geometric interpretation is exceed-
ingly useful in the application of these considerations to the Ising model 
we shall so restrict s. Therefore (3.15) says that the number of minus signs 
coming from the functions s(pu p2) as we go around any transition cycle 
in a clockwise fashion must be odd. 
The factors s(pu p2) are interpreted geometrically by drawing an 
arrow pointing from px to p2 if s(plt p2) is + 1 and an arrow pointing 
from p2 to px if s(pltp2) 
is —1. This construction is clearly consistent 
with the antisymmetry of a(px, p2). A lattice on which these arrows are 
drawn will be called an oriented lattice. 
We define the orientation parity of a transition cycle to be 4-1 ( — 1) if, 
as we traverse this cycle in either direction the number of arrows pointing 
in the direction of motion is even (odd). The previous discussion therefore 
proves 
Theorem A: If the orientation parity of every transition cycle is odd, 
all terms in the Pfaffian will have the same sign. 
It is not possible to draw arrows on a general planar lattice so that the 
orientation parity of every polygon with an even number of sides is odd. 
However, not all polygons with an even number of sides are transition 
cycles. 
To obtain a characterization of transition cycles on a lattice with free 
boundary conditions it is most useful to introduce the concept of inside 
and outside. For the square lattice drawn in its "natural" configuration 
(Fig. 4.5a) this concept is obvious. However, it must be pointed out that 
this "natural" configuration can be drawn in many topologically 
equivalent ways, as illustrated in Fig. 4.5b. These examples demonstrate 
that for our purposes the words inside and outside are not topologically 
invariant. Therefore when these words are used they always refer to a 
lattice drawn in the "natural" configuration of Fig. 4.5a. 
With this intuitive (but nontechnical) definition of inside and outside 
we may easily characterize transition cycles. The only figures which 
make up transition graphs are double bonds or transition cycles. Each of

(b) A lattice which is topologically equivalent

lattice points and bonds in its interior. 
these figures contains an even number of sites. Furthermore, these 
figures completely cover all sites of the lattice and no two figures can 
occupy the same site (see Fig. 4.3). Thus we have 
Theorem B: The number of points contained within any transition 
cycle on a planar lattice is even. 
To use the property of transition cycles given in Theorem Β to choose 
a set of arrows on a planar lattice to satisfy the conditions of Theorem A 
we first define an elementary polygon. For the square lattice (drawn in 
the natural configuration) the elementary polygons are defined as each 
closed square consisting of 4 lattice sites and 4 bonds. More generally, 
an elementary polygon is a closed polygon drawn on the lattice in its 
natural configuration which has no bonds of the lattice (and hence no 
points of the lattice) on its interior. 
If the number of arrows pointing in the clockwise direction on a 
polygon is odd (even) we say that the polygon is clockwise odd (even). 
Note that, in general, elementary polygons may have either an even or an 
odd number of sides, and thus an elementary polygon may be clockwise 
odd but counterclockwise even. 
With these definitions we can prove 
Theorem C: On any planar lattice (in its "natural" configuration) we 
may always choose an orientation of arrows such that every elementary 
polygon is clockwise odd. 
However, instead of proving this theorem in general, it is sufficient

(and much easier) to draw a set of arrows on the lattice of interest and 
so verify Theorem C directly for the few special cases we are really 
interested in. In this chapter we are concentrating on the square lattice. 
It is immediately seen that the set of arrows shown in Fig. 4.6 satisfies the 
conclusion of Theorem C. The numbers s(pu p2) determined from this 
lattice combined with (3.7) give the matrix elements (3.9). 
This set of arrows determined on elementary polygons satisfies the 
requirements of Theorem A for all transition cycles that are elementary 
polygons. To complete the proof that this specification of arrows satisfies 
the condition of Theorem A for all transition cycles on a planar lattice 
with free boundary conditions we prove 
Theorem D : Once arrows have been specified so that every elementary 
polygon is clockwise odd, then for any polygon the number of clockwise 
bonds is odd if the number of enclosed lattice points is even and is even 
if the number of enclosed lattice points is odd. 
In Fig. 4.7 we illustrate the elements of the proof of this theorem for 
the square lattice. However, the proof we give may be taken over word 
for word to the general case. 
We prove this theorem by first remarking that any polygon on the 
lattice is made up of a number of elementary polygons and that Theorem 
C assures that Theorem D holds on these elementary polygons. Therefore 
the theorem will follow by induction if we assume it to be true on all 
polygons made up of η elementary polygons and prove that if Γ„ is one 
of those polygons then the theorem also holds on the polygon Γ η + 1 
obtained by enlarging Γη to include any adjacent elementary polygon IV 
Suppose that Γη surrounds ρ lattice points, contains a clockwise arrows, 
and has c arrows in common with I \ (Fig. 4.7). Polygon Γ\ contains a' 
clockwise arrows, whereby Theorem C, a' is odd. The number of clock-
wise arrows in Γ π + 1 is the number of clockwise arrows in Γ„, plus the 
number of clockwise arrows in Γ1( minus the number of clockwise arrows 
lost from Γη by omitting the common arrows, minus the number of 
clockwise arrows lost from I \ by omitting the common arrows. Now if an 
arrow on a common bond is clockwise for Γ„ it will be counterclockwise 
for Γ\ because Ι \ is outside of Γ„. Therefore, the number of clockwise

clockwise arrows. We form Γ8 by removing 
the 2 (= c) common bonds. This adds one new 
point to the interior so the number of points 
inside Γ8 is 3. Furthermore, the number of 
clockwise arrows of Γ8 is clearly 7 + 3 — 2 = 
a + a' — c = 8. Therefore Theorem D holds.

arrows in Γ π + 1 is a + a' — c. Furthermore, the number of enclosed 
lattice points in Γ„ + 1 is ρ + c — 1, since when we omit c common 
bonds we must gain c — 1 new points in the interior. Now, by assumption, 
a is even (odd) if ρ is odd (even) and a' is odd. Therefore a + a' — c 
must be even (odd) if ρ + c — 1 is odd (even). Hence, by induction, 
Theorem D follows. 
We now may combine Theorem Β with Theorem D to conclude that 
on the oriented lattice of Fig. 4.6 the orientation parity of every transition 
cycle is odd. Therefore, Theorem A proves that

where for the square lattice the nonzero matrix elements of one repre-
sentation of AF are given by (3.9). But the term in Pf AF corresponding

choose the + sign in (3.17) and obtain the desired result (3.8).

To discuss the extension of the considerations of the previous section 
that is needed to treat the square lattice with cylindrical boundary 
conditions, we must first decide if we are going to impose cyclic boundary 
conditions in the vertical or horizontal direction. Since, to insure that 
the total number of sites J M f be even, we have taken JT to be even, 
there are several cases: 
(1) Both Ji and Jf are even. In this case if we apply cyclic boundary 
conditions in one direction we can consider cyclic boundary conditions 
in the other direction by a simple relabeling. 
(2) M odd and J f (by definition) even. In this case there are two 
distinct subcases : 
(a) Cyclic boundary conditions can be applied in the vertical direction. 
Then it is easily seen that the only allowed transition cycles are those 
considered in the previous section because it is not possible to have a 
transition cycle which loops the cylinder since this would require an odd 
number of bonds, whereas the number of bonds in a transition cycle 
must be even. Thus if we define ACyV by (3.9) and 
a(JK, k\ 1, k) = -«( 1, k\ Jt, k) = ( - l)kz2, 
(4.1) 
the conditions of Theorem A are satisfied and 
^•liè,^ = P f A . v 
(b) Cyclic boundary conditions can be applied in the horizontal 
direction. In this case the simple argument leading to (4.1) will not hold. 
The remainder of this section is devoted to proving that for this case and 
for case (1) 
^ 
= Pf Ac, 
where Ae is determined from (3.9) and from 
a(j\ 
j, 1) = ~a(j, 1 ; j, ΛΟ = - z i - 
(4.4) 
In cases (1) and (2b) there are two distinct classes of transition cycles: 
(1) cycles which do not loop completely around the cylinder, and (2) 
cycles which do loop around the cylinder precisely once. One particularly 
simple class 2 transition cycle has no vertical bonds and is shown in 
Fig. 4.8. There are, in addition, J ( — 1 transition cycles which differ 
from this one only by a vertical translation. These Ji transition cycles 
will be called elementary transition cycles of class 2. 
To include in the Pfaffian terms corresponding to transition cycles of 
class 1 involving bonds between column J f and column 1 we need to 
have for all j 
a{j, JT\ j, 1) = ~a(j, 1 ; j, JT) = zx

(4.56) 
The arrows corresponding to these two choices of sign are shown in 
Fig. 4.9. Clearly for both choices of signs the orientation parity of every 
elementary polygon and, hence, of every transition cycle of class 1 is odd. 
Therefore the arguments of the last section demonstrate that for either 
choice of the sign (4.5) all transition cycles of class 1 are included in the 
Pfaffian with the same sign. However, if we consider the elementary 
transition cycles of class 2 we see that the orientation parity will be 
negative only with the choice of sign (4.5b). We therefore complete the 
proof of (4.3) and (4.4) by proving 
Theorem E: If on the square lattice with cylindrical boundary condi-
tions the orientation parity of the elementary class 2 transition cycles is

negative, the orientation parity of all class 2 transition cycles is negative. 
To prove this we first remark that if we omit from the lattice all bonds 
and sites belonging to any class 2 transition cycle the cylinder is divided 
into two pieces. Since it must be possible to completely cover the lattice 
sites of each of these two pieces with double bonds, each piece contains 
an even number of sites. 
Secondly, we remark that an arbitrary class 2 transition cycle may be 
considered to be made up of an elementary class 2 transition cycle and 
one or more closed polygons that do not loop the cylinder, each of which 
(a) has some bonds in common with the elementary class 2 transition 
cycle and (b) has the rest of its bonds on only one side of the elementary 
class 2 transition cycle (Fig. 4.10).

sidèred as a superposition of an elementary 
class 2 transition cycle and a closed polygon.

With these two remarks the rest of the proof follows exactly along the 
lines of Theorem D of the previous section and is left as an exercise for

Our final extension of the dimer counting problem is to the square 
lattices with cyclic boundary conditions in both directions. Now, in 
addition to transition cycles which do not loop the torus or which loop 
the torus only once in the horizontal direction, there are transition cycles 
which loop the torus h times in the horizontal direction and υ times in 
the vertical direction; for example, see Fig. 4.11. 
It is a simple matter to extend the considerations of Section 3 to 
ensure that all dimer configurations connected by transition cycles with 
h = ν = 0 contribute to the Pfaffian with the same sign. Indeed if we 
choose the signs of a(j, k; j', k') as in (3.9) for all terms except those that 
refer to a horizontal bond from column J f to column 1 or a vertical 
bond from row J l to row 1, we may make the orientation parity of 
every elementary polygon, and hence of all transition cycles with

In the previous section it was possible to show that one of the several 
assignments of arrows for which the orientation parity of υ = h — 0 
transition cycles was odd had the property that the orientation parity of 
all transition cycles was odd. However, it is easily seen that no one 
assignment of signs in (5.1) can make the orientation parity of all three 
transition cycles in Fig. 4.13 odd simultaneously. To remedy this situation

together demonstrate that none of the four 
assignments of signs (3.1) will make the

we will show that it is possible to find a suitable linear combination of the 
Pfaffians of the 4 matrices defined by (5.1) such that while each individual 
Pfaffian will include some class of terms with a sign opposite to the rest, 
the complete linear combination will include each dimer configuration 
exactly once. In particular, we will show that 
V j t j r = i l - P f 
+ P f ^ 2 + P f ^ 3 + PÍA,]. 
(5.2) 
Since no choice of signs in (5.1) allows the orientation parity of all 
transition cycles to be odd, it is necessary to have an efficient way of 
determining what the orientation parity of a given transition cycle will 
be. The most useful classification would be that for a given set of signs 
(5.1) the orientation parity depended only on ν and h. Unfortunately, 
as the example of Fig. 4.14 shows, such a simple classification is not 
possible. However, our previous treatment has been much more general 
than it needs to be. In particular, we have used the fact that if the sign of 
any two terms in the Pfaffian is the same then all terms will be included 
in the Pfaffian with the same sign. We may replace this statement with 
the remark that if the sign of any dimer configuration is the same as one

fixed dimer configuration then all dimer configurations occur in the 
Pfaffian with the same sign. A most convenient classification of transition 
cycles results if we choose this fixed dimer configuration to be the con-
figuration C0 defined by (3.3). We call a transition cycle made up of the 
configuration C0 and an arbitrary configuration a C0 transition cycle. 
Several examples of C0 transition cycles are given in Fig. 4.15. Then 
Theorem A of Section 3 may be restated as 
ι ι ι 
Fig. 4.15. A C0 transition graph containing 
several Co transition cycles. 
Theorem A': If the orientation parity of every C0 transition cycle is 
odd, all terms in the Pfaffian will have the same sign. 
Each of the 4 sets of matrices specified by (3.9) and (5.1) satisfies the 
conditions of Theorem A for ν = h = 0, so they must also satisfy 
Theorem A'. However, for each choice of sign in (5.1) the orientation 
parity of a C0 transition cycle depends on υ and Λ alone. This may be 
seen if we first define an elementary C0 transition cycle to be a C0 transi-
tion cycle for which t; and h are not both zero and which may be traversed 
in such a fashion that on all the vertical bonds we always go from row j 
to row j + 1 and never from j + 1 to j (where J( + 1 is identified 
with 1). Elementary C0 transition cycles with A = \,v = 0; h = 0, υ = 1; 
and h = 1, ν = 1 are shown in Fig. 4.16. It is clear from this figure that, 
with the possible exception of the arrows between row M and row 1, 
with every upward vertical arrow f there is associated a horizontal 
arrow on a C0 bond as f 
*. This configuration gives an even con-
tribution to the orientation parity. Secondly, with the possible exception of 
the arrows between rows J t and 1, with every downward vertical arrow i 
is associated a horizontal arrow on a C0 bond as 
* j. This configuration 
also gives an even contribution to the orientation parity. But every ele-
mentary C0 transition consists ofv/2 of each of these two types of corner

plus horizontal bonds. Therefore, for the four sets of arrows determined 
from the assignment of signs in (5.1), the orientation parity of an ele-

We therefore will have determined the orientation parity of all C0 
transition cycles if we can prove 
Theorem F: The orientation parity of any C0 transition cycle with h 
horizontal loops and ν vertical loops is the same as the orientation parity 
of an elementary C0 transition cycle with the same values of h and v. 
To prove this theorem, consider an arbitrary C0 transition cycle to be 
a superposition of an elementary C0 transition cycle and a number of 
closed polygons. A C0 transition cycle has the property that if it occupies 
a site which is the endpoint of some C0 bond it covers the entire C0 bond 
as well. Therefore every lattice point in the interior of any of the closed 
polygons is connected to a neighboring interior point by a C0 bond. 
Since only one C0 bond may end at any point, we conclude that the 
number of points ρ enclosed by each closed polygon is even. Therefore, 
by Theorem D the orientation parity of each of these closed polygons is 

[66] 
T H E 
T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L 
I S I N G 
M O D E L 
odd. Furthermore, as we traverse the C 0 transition cycle the last bond 
on the elementary C 0 transition cycle before we pass to a bond of one of 
the closed polygons must be a C„ bond. Moreover, if we continue on 
around the C0 transition cycle the first bond of the elementary C 0 
transition cycle we cover after the closed polygon must also be a C0 bond. 
Therefore, since C 0 and non-C0 bonds alternate on all C0 transition 
cycles, we conclude that the number of bonds c which the elementary 
C 0 transition cycle and the closed polygon have in common is odd. 
The change in orientation parity in forming a C 0 transition cycle by the 
addition of a closed polygon to an elementary C 0 transition cycle is the 
number of common bonds minus the number of clockwise (or counter-
clockwise) arrows in the closed polygon which has the same parity as 
c + (p — 1). The foregoing arguments show that each term in this sum 
is odd. Therefore, the addition of this closed polygon does not change 
the orientation parity. 
We now wish to find a suitable linear combination of the Pfaffians of 
the 4 matrices which will make each class of C0 transition cycles specified 
by ν and h appear exactly once. The sign with which the class determined 
by υ and h will appear in the Pfaffian of each of the 4 separate matrices 
A, defined by (5.1) and (3.9) is the negative of (5.3). These signs are 
tabulated in Table 1. Not only is there no single matrix A¡ which includes

cluded in the Pfaffian of At.

all (h, v) configurations with the same sign but, since in each A, the 
term ν = 0, h = 0 is included with a + sign, whereas ν = even, h = 
even is included with a — sign, there would appear to be no linear 
combination of the 4 Pfaffians which could count all configurations with 
the same sign. However, it may easily be seen that there are no transition 
cycles with ν = even and h — even if υ # 0. In fact we can prove 
Theorem G: If a closed non-self-intersecting curve loops the torus ν 
times in the vertical direction and h times in the horizontal direction, ν 
and h can have no common divisor. 
To prove this theorem, represent the torus as a rectangle with opposite 
edges identified. Indeed, it is geometrically useful to repeat this basic

lattice periodically in both the vertical and the horizontal directions 
(Fig. 4.17) and identify equivalent points in each rectangle. If a curve is 
drawn from a point in the (0, 0) rectangle to an equivalent point in the 
(h, ν) rectangle, this curve corresponds to a curve that loops the torus h 
times in the horizontal direction and ν times in the vertical direction. 
To see that h and ν must have no common divisor it is sufficient to 
consider straight-line paths. But then it is clear that if h and υ have a 
common divisor d the straight line already passes through a point 
equivalent to the starting point in the (0,0) rectangle in the (h\d, v/d) 
rectangle. Therefore if h and ν have a common divisor it is not possible 
to draw the corresponding non-self-intersecting closed curve on the 
torus. 
Theorem G allows us to ignore the last row in Table 1. Therefore the 
linear combination of the 4 Pfaffians Pf A¡ which will include exactly 
once all classes of dimer configurations which are obtained from C0 by 
one transition cycle is 
M - P f A1 + Pf A2 + Pf Ag + Pf AJ. 
But if all configurations with one C0 transition cycle are correctly counted 
then all configurations are correctly counted. Therefore (5.2) holds.

The work of the three previous sections which relates the generating 
function for closest-packed dimer configurations to Pfaffians is useful 
only because the associated determinants may be evaluated. Many of 
these determinants have very simple structures which will occur again in 
the discussion of the Ising model of the next chapter. Therefore we will 
here explicitly evaluate all of the determinants we found in the three 
preceding sections. Finally we will determine the sign in the relation

functions. 
It was easier to relate Ζ¿¡¿^ to Pf Ar than it was to relate Z^^ 
to 
the linear combination (5.2). However, it is somewhat easier to evaluate 
the determinants related to the Pfaffians in

Therefore we need to calculate the eigenvalues of JN. 
The matrix JN has two important properties. First of all, the elements 
on each diagonal are equal, that is, the matrix elements are of the form 
βI.I- = 
Matrices of this form are known as Toeplitz matrices. Secondly, JN has 
the property that if the first row is transposed to the bottom of the 
matrix and the first column is transposed to the extreme right of the 
matrix, the matrix is transformed into itself, that is, JN is of the form 
(6.9) 
(6.10) 
(6.11) 
Toeplitz matrices of this form are called cyclic matrices. Cyclic matrices 
are important because their eigenvalues may be evaluated simply. 
Consider for example the specific case at hand, JN. Its eigenvector equa-
tion, 
Jsv = λι>, 
(6.12)

Dl

We seek an eigenvector of the form 
vt — a'. 
Then the second through the (Ν — l)th equations in (6.13) are all satisfied 
if one of them is, so the Ν equations of (6.13) reduce to the three equations 
α - α " " 1 = λ(α), 
— α - 1 + a = λ(α), 
« - » + ι _ β - ι 
= λ(α). 
These three equations will be identical if 
a" = 1. 
Therefore the Ν eigenvectors are 
= e27lUIN, 
1 
<n<N, 
and the Ν corresponding eigenvalues are 
Xm = gZniniN _ e-2ji¡n/M = 2/sin (2τγ«/ΛΓ). 
In general, the Ν eigenvectors of (6.12) are given by (6.17) and the Ν 
corresponding eigenvalues are 
λ<« = 2 a¡e™nllN. 
1 = 1 
These eigenvalues (6.18) may now be used in (6.9) and we obtain

The term coming from j = JÍ, k = JÍ is zero for all values of zx and z2. 
Hence we conclude that 
Pf A\ = (det A].)1'2 = 0. 
The three remaining determinants related by (5.2) to the Pfaffians in

may be evaluated almost as simply as was det Ax. To compute 
them we define another Ν χ Ν matrix,

The matrix JÍ, is not cyclic but since it is "almost" cyclic it is referred

equation then reduces to the three equations 
α + α " - ι = λ(«),

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING MODEL

(6.30c) 
To use these determinants finally to evaluate 
we need to de-
termine the sign in the relation Pf A, = + (det A()112. For this purpose 
we note that, though all three determinants are nonnegative, 
det A-2 = 0 
if z2 = 0 or if Zi = 0 and J( is odd, 
det A3 = 0 
ifz 1 = 0, 
and 
det At = 0 
if zx = z2 = 0 or if zx = 0 and Jt is odd. 
(6.31) 
Furthermore we may easily use the geometric considerations that were 
used to derive the matrices At in the first place to find that

We may determine the sign of (det A,)112 by continuity from the special

For lattices of finite size, the evaluations of ZF, Zc, and Z T of the

cussed in Chapter II, our major interest in the Ising model is in the

this digression on dimer statistics by studying the behavior of Z F

Specific Heat of Onsager's Lattice in the Absence of 
a Magnetic Field 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 
The discussion of dimer statistics in the previous chapter is extremely 
useful for our treatment of the two-dimensional Ising model because, as 
we will show in the next section, the partition function for the two-
dimensional Ising model in the absence of a magnetic field is very closely 
related to the generating function for closest-packed dimers on an 
appropriate lattice.1 For this reason the partition function may be ex-
pressed in terms of the Pfaffian of a suitable matrix. However, the 
evaluation of the Pfaffian for an arbitrary lattice is a most complicated 
problem and in order to obtain explicit results we will confine our 
attention in this chapter to Onsager's lattice. (The lifting of this restric-
tion in a nontrivial fashion will be studied in the last two chapters of this 
book.) Even the restriction to Onsager's lattice is not quite sufficient to 
obtain an explicit result for the partition function because it has not 
been possible to evaluate exactly the relevant Pfaffian when the boundary 
conditions are free in both directions. Therefore, in this chapter we will 
restrict our attention to Onsager's lattice with toroidal boundary con-
ditions. In the following two chapters we will study the effects associated 
with cyclic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction and free 
boundary conditions in the vertical direction. For both boundary con-
ditions we find that in the thermodynamic limit the free energy per site 
is the same. From this free energy we derive the specific heat c and 
demonstrate that there exists one, and only one, temperature, Tc, at 
which c fails to be an analytic function of T. At this "critical tem-

This remarkable logarithmic divergence of the specific heat of Onsager's

We evaluate the sum over all a = + 1 by expanding the products. 
Each term in this expansion contains a factor for every nearest-neighbor 
pair of sites a and a which may be either 1 or ζσασα. where ζ is the 
hyperbolic tangent of β times the energy of the bond between a and a . 
Therefore, there are terms proportional to 1, σα, 
σ®, and 
However, 
since σa can be only + 1 or — 1, all even powers of σα may be replaced by 1 
whereas all terms containing σα or σ^ give no contribution, since

Furthermore,

Therefore we may obtain Ζ from the expansion of the products in (2.4) by 
omitting all terms where any σα appears an odd number of times, replac-
ing every 
and σ* by 1, and multiplying the resulting function of z1; z2 
by y - v . This procedure has a simple and useful graphical representation. 
Let Npg be the number of figures that can be drawn on the lattice with the 
following properties: (i) each bond between nearest neighbors may be 
used, at most, once; (ii) an even number of bonds terminate at each 
vertex; (iii) the figure contains ρ horizontal and q vertical bonds. Several 
examples of figures with the properties (i) and (ii) are shown in Fig. 5.1.

the restriction that no two sides may overlap.2 It is furthermore evident 
that, so far as this discussion is concerned, the restriction to Onsager's

given a weight of tanh β (the energy of the bond). 
There are several ways of relating the Ising-model problem of (2.8) [or 
(2.9)] to a problem of closest-packed dimers. Each method involves 
replacing each site on the Ising lattice with bonds zt by a cluster of sites on 
a new "counting" lattice. One such cluster, which replaces one Ising 
vertex with six new vertices3 is shown in Fig. 5.2. The eight possible con-
figurations of bonds at any Ising vertex are in 1-1 correspondence with 
the ways one may draw closest-packed dimer configurations on this 
cluster as shown in Fig. 5.3. Therefore the sum in (2.8) is exactly the same 
as the generating function for closest-packed dimer configurations for the 
lattice of Fig. 5.4, where the three classes of bonds to be distinguished are :

apply the results of Sec. 3 of the last chapter to construct an oriented 
lattice which allows us to represent the generating function as a Pfaffian.

mentary polygons is clockwise odd is given in Fig. 5.4. In terms of the

then the partition function of Onsager's lattice with toroidal boundary 
conditions is 
Ζ = \{2 cosh ßE1 cosh βE2)^{-

The Pfaffians which appear in (2.12) will be evaluated by means of the 
relation

However, it is trivially possible to find 4J(Jf χ 4JMf matrices At such 
that

The matrices A{ are antisymmetric and it might be expected that (2.16) 
can be given a geometric interpretation on a counting lattice obtained 
from the Ising lattice by replacing each Ising site by a cluster of 4 sites. 
Indeed, the matrices A{ do define oriented lattices and the oriented 
cluster which replaces a single Ising vertex is shown in Fig. 5.6. This

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING

To obtain the final explicit expression for Z j t i t 
remains to de-
termine the signs in (2.14) and substitute the resulting expression into 
(2.12). The determination of these ± signs is a bit tedious since they 
depend on the temperature. However, these signs are irrelevant to the 
computation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit and for that 
reason we defer their determination until Sec. 4. Therefore, as long as zx 
and z2 are such that no factor in (2.23) vanishes, we may use (2.12), (2.14), 
(2.23) and the definition of integral to obtain the celebrated result5 that 
the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of Onsager's lattice at H = 0

The most interesting property of the free energy (2.24) is that there 
exists one temperature Tc at which it fails to be an analytic function of T. 
The existence of this Tc may be easily seen if we reduce the double 
integral in (2.24) to a single integral by explicitly integrating over (say) 
θ2. To carry out this integration let 
ζ = e">». 
(3.1) 
In the ζ-plane the integrand of (2.24) has logarithmic branch points at 
ζ = 0, oo, and at the points α(βλ) and a ' 1 ^ ) where α(θ) is the larger 
root in magnitude of the quadratic equation

the contour of integration. This circumstance causes F to fail to be an 
analytic function of temperature when (3.9) holds, in a manner which will 
be made explicit shortly. 
For a given value of Ex and of E2 there is precisely one value of Τ such 
that (3.9) holds. This value of Τ is defined as Tc and is called the critical 
temperature. All thermodynamic functions of Onsager's lattice at Η = 0 
will eventually be seen to be nonanalytic functions of Τ at Tc. In par-
ticular, we will see in Chapter X that for all temperatures below Tc 
Onsager's lattice possesses a spontaneous magnetization. Therefore a 
phase transition takes place at Tc. 
The temperature Tc defined by (3.9) plays an enormous role in the 
theory of Onsager's lattice. Therefore it is useful to rewrite (3.9) in 
several ways. We may multiply (3.9) by 1 + |z2| to find the symmetric 
formula 
I «al = 1

This curve is plotted in Fig. 5.10. We may also write (3.9) as

Finally, we note that

and hence we find that (3.12) is equivalent to 
1 = sinh 2ß\E1\ sinh 218|£2|.

If |£i| = \E2\ = E this specializes to 
I = s i n h 2 j 8 £

from which we find 
kTc = 2£/ln (1 + V2) = 2.26918531.. .E. 
(3.16) 
If Tc is fixed and E2 ~> 0 we find that Ex must go to oo as 
l^il ~-ikTc\n(\E2\lkTc). 
(3.17) 
If E1 is fixed and E2 
0, then Tc vanishes as 
kTc ~ -21^1/ln \E21. 
(3.18) 
In general, the contours in the Eu E2 plane along which Tc is a constant 
are plotted in Fig. 5.11. 
We now must establish that, in fact, F does fail to be an analytic 
function of Tat Tc. Indeed, we will not only establish the lack of analyticity 
at Tc but will be able to discover from (2.24) precisely how the internal 
energy u and the specific heat c behave near Tc. We will eventually study 
this lack of analyticity for the general case Ex Φ E2. However, the special 
case E1 = E2 has a simplifying feature which makes the analysis much

on the general case.

The region of integration of the double integral in (3.20) is the square

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING

It now remains to approximate u and c when Τ ~ Tc. To carry out this 
approximation we need an expansion for Κ(k) and E(fc) when k ~ 1. It 
is clear from (3.27) and (3.28) that, as k 
1, 
K(fc) -> oo 
(3.45) 
but 
E(A:)->E(1) = 1. 
(3.46) 
To discuss the manner in which K(&) diverges, we rewrite (3.27) as 
K ( Ä ) = J0 
(cos2 φ + k'2 sin2 φy»' 
( 3 , 4 7 ) 
If k -> 1, then k' -s- 0. We break the integrand in (3.47) into two pieces,

Somewhat more precisely, it can be shown8 that, as k

K(ifc) = In | p j + 0(k'2 In \k'\).

Therefore from (3.34) we see that u(T) is a continuous function of Τ even 
at Tc, where its value is 
u(Tc) = - E coth 2ßcE = -V2E.

(3.58) 
In this form it is manifest that when Ex = E2 = E the specific heat of 
Onsager's lattice has the logarithmic divergence shown in (1.1). It further 
should be noticed that the coefficient of the logarithm and the additive 
constant are the same for Τ above and below Tc. 
We now turn our attention to the behavior of u and c in the general 
case Ex Φ E2. We will show that the qualitative conclusions about the 
continuity of u and the logarithmic divergence of c at Tc continue to be 
true in the general case. However, it is not possible to find expressions 
analogous to (3.34) and (3.44) which express u and c in terms of complete 
elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds. For the general case we are 
forced to introduce the complete elliptic integral of the third kind,9

We could continue an analysis just as we did for the case Ex = E2, by 
developing formulas for êiljëv

Τ ~ Tc it remains to develop an approximation to Π^ν, k) when k ~ 1, 
to study the continuity of u and the logarithmic divergence of c. 
We choose not to pursue this line of analysis for two reasons. First, the 

[98] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
resulting expression for the specific heat contains a forest of hyperbolic 
functions. Secondly, the expressions (3.68) and (3.70), which involve 
elliptic integrals of the third kind, do not manifestly reduce to (3.34) 
when E1 — E2. Therefore, to make the simplification for Ex = E2 more 
apparent and to obtain a more compact form of the final answer, we 
will present the method of reduction of u to elliptic integrals which was 
originally used by Onsager. 
Our starting point is (3.63). We consider first Τ > Tc. The square root 
is defined to be + 1 when θ = π and, for Τ > Tc, it is easily seen that 
when 0 = 0 the integrand is - 1 . Furthermore, when 0~> — 0 the 
integrand (which is in general complex) goes into its reciprocal. There-
fore, we can rewrite the coefficient of Ex in (3.63) as 
-IT-1 Í άθ cos Φ(θ),

and in particular 
φ(0) = π, 
φ(ιτ) = 0. 
We achieve a reduction to a complete elliptic integral by considering φ as 
the independent variable instead of 0. Therefore, 
/>-<«')=/> II cos φ. 
(3.72) 
(3.73) 
(3.74) 
(3.75) 
For (3.75) to be useful, we must be able to compute 8θ/8φ explicitly 
as a function of φ alone. To do this, we first use the definition of αϊ and 
o2 in (3.73) to find 
cos φ = (sinh 2βΕ1 cosh 2βΕ2 - cosh 2ßE1 cos 0) 
χ {[cosh 2βΕ1 cosh 2βE2 - sinh 2ßE1 cos 0 - sinh 2ßE2] 
χ [cosh 2ßE1 cosh 2ßE2 - sinh 2ßEL cos 0 + sinh 2ßE 2]}~ m. 
This equation may be solved for cos 0, giving 
cosh 2j8E1 cos φ - k> coth 2ßE2(l - kj sin2 φ)1'2 
C 0 S 
~ cosh 2ßE1(l - kl sin2 φ)1'2 - k> coth 2ßE2 cos φ' 
From this we easily obtain 
sin 0 = (1 - cos2 0)1'2

cosh 2ßE1(l - k\ sin2 φ)112 - k> coth 2ßE2 cos φ'

This may now be used in (3.75) and, if we note that 
[cosh 2/3£'1(l - kl sin2 φ)112 - k> coth 2ßE2 cos ψ]'1 
= [cosh 2ßE1(l - kl sin2 φ)112 + k> coth 2ßE2 cos φ](1 - A:2.)"1

and therefore (3.87) reduces to (3.34). 
A similar reduction procedure may be carried out when Τ < Tc. 
However, in this case, the expression on the right-hand side of (3.77) does 
not go monotonically from — 1 to 1 as θ goes from 0 to π. Instead it 
goes from 1 when θ is π through some minimum value and then increases

the use of (3.84) and the Landen transformation (3.88) reduces (3.103) to

We now compute the specific heat by differentiating u with respect to

Fig. S.12. Specific heat of Onsager's lattice 
for Eil Ε,. = 1, E2¡Ei = 0.01, and £ 2/£i = 0. 
The abscissa of the graph is 2kTHE1 + E2), 
which ensures that the areas under all the 
curves are the same. 
Using these formulas we plot the specific heat in Fig. 5.12 for several 
values of EJE2. 
It remains only to demonstrate that the critical behavior of u and c in 
this general case is the same as was previously found when Ex = E2. To 
study this behavior we need, in addition to the expansion for K(£) and 
E(fc) obtained in (3.46) and (3.53), an approximation for n^e, k) when 
k ~ 1. This approximation is obtained if we write

With these approximations for Κ, E, and IIj we can easily study u and

and (3.103) [or into (3.68) and (3.70)], we find that u(T) is continuous at 
T. and that

(3.119) 
Therefore, as in the special case E1 = E2, the specific heat has a logarith-
mic singularity at Tc. Furthermore, as in (3.58), the coefficient of the 
logarithm and the additive constant are the same for Τ above and 
below Tc. 
This completes the analysis of the specfiic heat of Onsager's lattice in 
the thermodynamic limit. However, it may be asked how these results 
are related to the case of a lattice that is large but finite, since for such a 
lattice the specific heat must be an analytic (and hence bounded) function 
of temperature for all T. This question was studied by Onsager in his 
original paper11 for the special case where Jf -> oo but J( is finite and 
was studied in great detail for the general case of J i and J f both large 
but JtjjV of order one by Ferdinand and Fisher.12 We could reproduce 
the results of these papers if we carried out a detailed analysis of the 
partition function of a finite lattice given by (2.12). However, as our 
primary interest is in the case J( -> oo and Jf -> oo and as the com-
putations are somewhat involved we will not pursue this topic in detail. 
Instead we will be content with the following remarks. 
When J( and 
are large and J(¡jV is of order one, the specific heat 
deviates appreciably from the specific heat of the infinite lattice only 
when (1 — T/Jc) ~ 
The maximum of the specific heat of the finite 
lattice in general does not occur at Tc but at some other value which 
depends on 
and the height of this maximum grows as Jt 
oo as 
In Jt. In the case considered by Onsager ^"->-00 and J Í finite the devia-
tion of the position of the maximum from Tc is proportional to J( ~2 In J(\ 
and the value of the specific heat at this maximum is approximately given 
as

4. THE A N T I F E R R O M A G N E T I C SEAM 
We close this chapter by returning to the one point in the calculation 
of Zm.jt which was not completed in Sec. 2, namely, the determination of 
the signs in (2.14). These signs are important because there is more than 
one term on the right-hand side of (2.12). 
A straightforward method of determining these signs is to use (2.23) 
and (2.14) in (2.12) and then to adjust the signs to make the value of 
Zjt.jr so obtained agree for certain special values of zj and z2 with values 
of Zjt.jr which may be independently computed. Then for values of zx 
and z2 which may be joined to the special values by a path along which 
det Α, Φ 0 the sign of det A¡ will be fixed by the requirement that det A, 
be a continuous function of zx and z2. It is easily seen from (2.23) that 
det Ai = 0 can occur only if 
When (4.1) is satisfied, Τ = Tc and we have the following cases: 
(1) if Ex > 0 and E2 > 0, then det Ax = 0; 
(2) If 
< 0 and E2 > 0, then det Αλ = 0 when Jf is even and 
det A3 = 0 when Jf is odd; 
(3) If Ei > 0 and E2 < 0, then det 
= 0 when J( is even and 
det A2 = 0 when J( is odd; and 
(4) if-Ej < 0 and E2 < 0, then det A1 = 0 when Jf and J< are both 
even, det A2 = 0 when Jf is even and JÍ is odd, det A3 — 0 when Jf 
is odd and J ( is even, and det At = 0 when Jf and J t are both odd. 
From this list it is clear that, if ζλ and z2 are suitably small so that (4.1) 
does not hold, then the signs of (det At)lm may be determined by con-
tinuity from the cases zx = 0 or z2 = 0. However, for any value of 
Ζχ φ 0, if |z2| is made large enough (4.1) will eventually hold and the 
sign of one of the (det A,)112 may change. For values of z1 and z2 in this 
region the sign of that (det At)1'2 which could change will be determined 
by continuity from Τ = 0. Therefore we consider several special cases. 
(A) Here zL and z2 are inside the curve in the z1( z2-plane specified by 
(4.1) (that is, Γ > Tc). If z2 = 0, 
(1 + z?)( 1 + z|) - 21^1(1 - zi) - 2|z2|(1 - z?) = 0.

Similarly, if zt = 0 
det A = det A3 = (1 - zf 
(4.2c) 
and 
det A2 = det A4 = (1 + z f 
We know from (III.2.15) that if z2 = 0 
and if zx = 0 
Zm,jt = (2 cosh βΕ2)·*·*(1 + z f y r . 
(4.2d) 
(4.3a) 
(4.36)

χ [-(det A,)1'2 + (det A2)112 + (det Aa)112 + (detΛ)1'2]· 
(4.4) 
(B) In this case z-i and z2 are outside the curve in the z^za-plane 
specified by (4.1) (7" < Tc). Now the signs in (2.14) are determined by 
continuity from Τ = 0. There are 3 subcases to consider: 
(i) Et > 0, E2 > 0 and J( and J/~ unrestricted; Ex > 0, E2 < 0, Jf 
even; E^ < 0, E2 > 0, J( even; or Ex < 0, E2 < 0, JT and Jt both 
even. Thus det Ax = 0 when (4.1) is satisfied. In this case the ground-
state energy is 
Thus, combining (4.7), (4.6), and (2.12) with (2.14) we conclude that

tions. The antiferromagnetic seam is between 
columns 3 and 4. 
This ground state deviates from a periodic up-down arrangement of 
spins in the horizontal direction by the necessity, due to the fact that JT 
is odd, of having one column of bonds connecting spins pointing in the 
same direction. This column of mismatched spins is an antiferromagnetic 
seam such as we encountered in the ground state of the one-dimensional 
Ising model. The energy of this ground state is

The skeptic may now argue with the somewhat cavalier manner with 
which we obtained the free energy per site in the thermodynamic limit 
from Zjf jr in Sec. 2. There we simply took the logarithm of (det A,)112 
and converted the resulting sum to an integral by the use of the definition 
of integral. In other words, we made the approximation

This approximation is the same for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, if 
Τ > Tc we may use (4.4) to find 
Z j K j r ~ 
(4.19) 
and, if Τ < Tc and the conditions of (Β, i) hold so that there is no anti-
ferromagnetic seam, we use (4.8) to find 
Zjt.jr ~ 2 e - ^ i F . 
(4.20) 
However, if Τ < Tc and the conditions of (Β, ii) or (Β, iii) hold, so that 
there is (at least) one antiferromagnetic seam, the use of the approxima-
tion (4.18) in (4.11) or (4.17) yields 
Z j t . ^ ~

(4.21) 
To demonstrate that this "vanishing" of the partition function does 
not invalidate the previous calculation and analysis of the free energy, 
we will present a more precise approximation for Z j t ^ under the con-
ditions of (B, ii) than that given by (4.21). We first use the exact evalua-
tions (4.12) in (4.11) to write

when Β = 2z2(l — ζϊ). The factors in each product are the sums of two 
terms, the second of which is exponentially smaller than the first when 
oo. Approximation (4.21) is obtained by omitting these terms. 
Since this approximation vanishes, we must continue to the next order of 
approximation. Thus we find 
àUik)

(4·23) 
The first factor in this approximation is independent of shape and 
gives the free energy per site discussed in Sec. 2. The second factor, 
however, is more complicated. If Τ 
0 it is approximated by 
2jre-2B\El\^^ 
(4.24) 
which is in conformity with (4.10). On the other hand, ifO < Τ < Tc and 
J( » J f , then the sum is well approximated by its largest term. This 
term is easily seen to come from k = Jf and we have 
Z M < j r ~ „ ( „ y ^ e " · * " , 
(4.25) 
where we have used the α of (3.3); more specifically, we note that 
« w - l = Ν - 1 ( γ γ τ ? Π ) ' 
( 4 · 2 6 ) 
If we now let T - > 0 in (4.25) we obtain 
Zjt,jr 
~ 
+ 
(4.27) 
This does not agree with (4.10) since it lacks the factor U f . Therefore, as 
far as the sum in (4.23) is concerned, the approximations which are valid 
for J( » 
1 and Jf » 
1 with Τ fixed and positive fail in the Γ—> 0 limit. 
The significance of the sum in (4.23) may be made clearer if we write

lA(k) + VA2(k) - B2J 
Because a(ek)¡a(n) has the minimum value of 1, the sum does not depend 
exponentially on J(. However, the value of the sum will depend on the 
manner in which J( -»- oo and Jf - > oo. In particular, if 0 < Τ < Tc we 
may consider evaluating the sum by a steepest-descent method. Only 
the values of 9k near π contribute and we may write 
α(θΗ) ~ <χ(π) + m

We may consider how this sum behaves for various relations between Μ 
and JT. For example, if Jt = KJV as JT-*• oo, then (4.31) becomes 
(4.32) 
where c(K) depends on Κ alone and not on J( or Jf separately. If 
J ( = K^Jf* as JT 
oo, then (4.31) becomes 
c ^ M * · ) - · * , 
(4.33) 
where, again, ^(Äi) depends only on 
and not on J( or JT. In all 
cases the logarithm of the sum in (4.30) will vanish if we divide by J( 
and let M -»• oo, no matter how Jt and JT are related. Therefore we 
conclude that if J( and JT are large

(4.34) 
The first term in (4.34) gives the free energy per site of Sec. 2. The 
second term is proportional to J ( and exists only for the case in which 
an antiferromagnetic seam is present at Τ = 0. Accordingly, for 0 < Τ < 
T„ we follow Onsager13 and interpret 
as the additional free energy per row in a lattice with an antiferromagnetic 
seam. In contrast to the one-dimensional case, this additional free energy 
does not vanish as soon as Τ becomes sensibly different from zero but 
remains nonzero until Τ = Tc. This reflects the not unexpected fact that 
the antiferromagnetic order which is present in one dimension only at 
Τ = 0 persists in two dimensions until Τ = Tc. However, it would be 
more satisfying if (4.35) could be computed directly from a knowledge 
of the antiferromagnetic order. Unfortunately, even though in Chapters 
X-XII we will learn a great deal about both ferromagnetic and antiferro-
magnetic order in Onsager's lattice, such a direct calculation of (4.35) has 
not been found.

Boundary Specific Heat and Magnetization 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The specific heat of Onsager's lattice at H = 0 computed in the last 
chapter is only the first of several quantities which we will study. More 
specifically, we will later concern ourselves with the spontaneous magneti-
zation and the spin-spin correlation functions of Onsager's lattice. 
Unfortunately, the study of these quantities requires the introduction of 
additional mathematical machinery, in particular, the theory of Wiener-
Hopf sum equations. This machinery will be developed in detail in 
Chapter IX. However, even with these techniques, it has not yet proved 
possible to compute the free energy, to say nothing of the spin-spin 
correlation functions, of the Onsager lattice in the presence of a magnetic 
field. Therefore complete information about magnetic properties of 
Onsager's lattice is not available. For example, we do not possess analytic 
expressions for the behavior of the magnetization at Τ = Tc near Η = 0. 
In other words, the one-dimensional Ising model can be completely 
solved but shows no phase transition, while the two-dimensional Ising 
model discussed in the last chapter cannot yet be solved exactly in the 
presence of a magnetic field. 
We therefore look for a model somewhere intermediate between the 
one-dimensional and the two-dimensional Ising models. This model must 
have a phase transition in the absence of a magnetic field and still be 
exactly solvable for all values of the magnetic field. In this chapter we 
shall show that the boundary behavior of the two-dimensional Ising 
model has these two properties. More precisely, we impose on the 
Onsager lattice a cyclic boundary condition in the horizontal direction 
only and let a magnetic field <Ç> interact with one of the two hori-
zontal boundary rows of spins. Fortunately, in this case, the partition

function can be studied exactly by the Pfaffian method of the last chapter, 
and we find that the logarithm of this partition function may be 
written

The term JÍJTF 
is the bulk free energy we obtained in the previous 
chapter. The terms 
and 
are additional contributions 
coming from the existence of the free boundary which interacts with the 
magnetic field. Both 
and 
together with a number of other 
properties such as the spin-spin correlation function, can be computed 
exactly in the limit of the infinite lattice. This chapter is devoted to the 
study of these boundary contributions to the free energy,1 while the 
correlation function of two spins on the boundary is the subject of the 
next chapter.

The system to be studied in this chapter and the next is the Onsager 
lattice with cyclic boundary conditions imposed in the horizontal direc-
tion only. The lattice has 2Jt 
rows and U/~ columns 2 and it interacts 
with a magnetic field applied to one of the two boundary rows (defined 
to be the first row). We use German letters to denote quantities pertaining 
to the boundary. The interaction energy for this system is

1. The material of this chapter and the next is taken from Β. M. McCoy and T. T. 
Wu, Phys. Rev. 162, 436 (1967). For an alternative derivation of some of the 
results of Sec. 4 see M. E. Fisher and A. E. Ferdinand, Phys. Rev. Letters 19, 
169 (1967). 
2. We choose the number of columns and the number of rows to be both even to 
avoid all problems connected with a possible antiferromagnetic seam.

where Npqr is the number of figures that can be drawn on the lattice with 
the following properties. First, each bond between nearest neighbors may 
be used, at most, once. Secondly, the figure contains ρ horizontal bonds 
and q vertical bonds. Thirdly, let ejk be the number of bonds with the site 
( j , k) as one end; then, for j > 1, ejk is even, that is, ejk = 0, 2, or 4. And 
lastly, r is the number of elk which is odd. An example with ρ = 12, 
q = 14, and r = 4 is shown in Fig. 6.1(a). 
We wish to express the sum in (2.4) in terms of an appropriate Pfaffian. 
To do so, we first note that if ζ is zero, then in the sum it is sufficient to 
keep only the terms with Npq0, which is the number of closed polygons 
with ρ horizontal bonds and q vertical bonds. The factor zjz| is taken 
into account by associating a factor Zj with each horizontal bond and a 
factor z2 with each vertical bond, as shown in Fig. 6.2. This procedure 
may also be followed for the case of general ζ by adding a zeroth row of 
sites connected to the first row of sites by vertical bonds of weight z. The 
sites in this zeroth row are also connected to each other by bonds of 
weight 1 between nearest neighbors, as shown in Fig. 6.3(e). Each figure 
on the original lattice counted in Nmr corresponds, because of the cyclic

on the lattice in Fig. 6.3(a). These polygons that correspond to the 
example of Fig. 6.1(a) are shown in Figs. 6.1(6) and 6.1(c). Each of the 
closed polygons has ρ horizontal bonds, not including those on the zeroth 
row, and ρ + r vertical bonds, of which r are between the zeroth row and 
the first row. That there are two closed polygons is clear from the example 
of Fig. 6.1 ; in case r = 0, either all the bonds on the zeroth row are used

or none is used. We have thus reduced the problem of evaluating (2.4) 
to that of finding the generating function for closed polygons on the 
lattice of Fig. 6.3(a). By the methods of the previous chapter, the solution

free energy as given by (3.32) together with the boundary entropy and 
boundary specific heat, both of which are essentially derivatives of 0fo 
with respect to the temperature T. The interesting features are to be 
found in the vicinity of the critical temperature Tc; there the boundary 
entropy is unbounded while the boundary specific heat has a singularity 
of the form (Tc — T)' 1. These features are not possible for the corre-
sponding bulk properties, and remind us very strongly that we are 
dealing with boundary effects.

We begin with a qualitative discussion of

as may be expected, g 0 is finite, nonnegative, and independent of the 
signs of E1 and E2. The behavior of

The rest of this section is devoted to an analysis of the behavior of go 
when Τ is near Tc. Since there is no magnetic field, g 0 depends only on 
the magnitudes of Ex and E2, but not on their signs. Therefore, without 
loss of generality, we assume both E1 and E2 to be positive. With this 
convention, a2 — 1 when Τ = Tc. An inspection of (4.4) with (4.2) then 
indicates that the expansion of go for a2 near 1 may contain terms 
proportional to the following : 1,(1 — a2) In |1 — α2|, 1 — a2, (1 — a2)2· 
In j 1 — a2|, (1 — a2)2, and so forth. We are only interested in the terms 
containing the logarithms, since they are responsible for the singularities 
in the boundary entropy

The computation of these required terms is rather complicated.3 The

The second step is to continue analytically in r, taken to be a complex 
variable. Define disc g 0 by

We consider the case Τ > Tc first. Both g0(T) and ίίο(τβ2·'") are given by

is more convenient to proceed directly.

(4.24) and (4.32) has been taken to be less than IT in magnitude. By (4.25), 
Eqs. (4.31) and (4.34) can be combined in the form 
(4.35) 
for both Τ > Tc and Τ < Tc. Note that the Taylor series to be used in 
(4.35) may be different for Τ > Tc and for Τ < Tc. We shall return to 
this point later in this section. 
It remains to substitute (4.35) into (4.19) and (4.20). Let zlc and z2c 
be the values of zj and z2 at Τ = Tc, so that by (V.3.11) 
1 — Zlc — Z2c — zlcz2c = 0.

Thus the integrand is singular if and only if 
(1 + zt)(zl - z2) 
" - z2(l - Zj)(l - ζ2)" 
( 5· 3 )

This form is needed for purposes of analytical continuation.

both satisfied. Therefore

(5.11) 
The qualitative motion of r is of interest. In the el9-plane, α has four 
branch points, at au l/al5 a2, and l/a2. We define the cut plane for ew by 
joining these branch points pairwise along the real axis; thus the unit 
circle does not intersect the branch cuts unless |«2| = 1. In this cut plane, 
|a| > 1. Therefore, by (5.3), there is a pair of singular points at r and 1/r 
in the cut plane if and only if 
(1 + zi)(zi

With this information on r it is clear that fflli is an analytic function of 
φ except when Τ < Tc and φ = 0. We proceed to study the behavior of 
Six near φ = 0 and also the analytic continuation of ÏÏÎ! as a function 
o f $ . 
A. Spontaneous Magnetization 
The boundary spontaneous magnetization is defined to be 
9^(0 +) = lim aKiOë). 
(5.17) 
By (5.1), it is zero unless r -> 1 in this limit. That is, by (5.16), it is zero 
unless Τ < Tc and E± > 0. We consider only this case. Expansion about 
θ = 0 gives

magnetization (5.17) be different from zero. On the other hand, we

expect that, if Μ and JT are large but are not both infinite, the magnetiza-
tion, even though it vanishes when ξ» = 0, should in some sense be well 
approximated by (5.1). The sense of this approximation can be made 
more precise by considering the boundary magnetization of the finite 
strip in which JT is infinite but J(, while large, is finite. We thus must 
retain the term proportional to a~ i J t in (3.26) and find

If we let Jt 
00, we recover (5.1). In that case, when Τ < Tc, E1 > 0, 
and z-> 0, the integral multiplying ζ diverges as 1/z and spontaneous 
magnetization occurs. If we keep M finite, however, when Τ < T„ 
Ει > 0, and ζ -»• 0, the integral multiplying ζ is finite, so liBt1 —0. When 
ζ is not zero, then when J ( is large enough that

the terms proportional to a - 4-* may be neglected and the boundary 
magnetization for the finite strip becomes identical with the boundary 
magnetization of the half-plane. Only very near § = 0 will the boun-
dary magnetization of the strip be sensibly different from the boundary 
magnetization of the half-plane. 
We are interested in seeing in detail how spontaneous magnetization 
arises when Τ < Tc as Ji -> oo. We may compute this behavior from 
(5.22) for large J i by expanding the integrand about 0 = 0 and keeping 
the lowest-order terms. Using (5.18) we obtain

B. Behavior Near Critical Temperature 
We apply essentially the same procedure which we used to compute 
2K1(0+) to study the behavior of 
when Tis near Tc and § is positive 
and small. We consider first the ferromagnetic case where E1 > 0. The 
basic idea is still to expand about 0 = 0, but the actual computation is 
somewhat less straightforward than that of spontaneous magnetization. 
Consider first Τ < Tc; we neglect throughout terms in SJ^ of order z.

In (5.34), the coefficient of ρ in the logarithm is arbitrary; it has been 
chosen to make (5.35) below simple. The desired result follows immedi-
ately from Eqs. (5.27), (5.30), and (5.32)-(5.34) :

Equations (5.27)-(5.29) hold without modification, and (5.30) is also 
valid if «2 is replaced by l/a2. So far as 5Wi2) is concerned, the main 
change is the appearance of 1 + cosh θ instead of — 1 + cosh Θ. The 
result is 
for Τ > Tc. 
As 
(5.35) agrees with (5.19) and exhibits the square-root 
behavior explicitly. At Τ = Tc, it follows from either (5.35) or (5.36) that 
Thus the boundary magnetic susceptibility is not finite at Τ = Tc. More 
generally, we get from (5.35) and (5.36) that

both above and below the critical temperature. In other words, the 
boundary magnetic susceptibility at zero field has a logarithmic singularity 
at the critical temperature. 
It is also necessary to determine the behavior near Tc for two remaining 
cases: (i) Ex > 0 with ξ) away from zero and (ii) Ex < 0. This can be 
easily done by means of the devices of analytic continuation and 
Pochammer's contour. In this manner we obtain for case (i)

In both cases the Taylor series above Tc are the same as those below Tc. 
C. Hysteresis 
We return once more to the ferromagnetic case below critical tempera-
ture, that is, Τ < Tc and E1 > 0. As seen above, SJlj is an analytic func-
tion of φ for all φ φ 0, and Sftj is discontinuous at ξ) = 0. We discuss 
here the analytic continuation of 
; since Sili is odd, it is sufficient to 
consider the continuation of SRX for $ > 0 to negative values of φ. Let 
5DIÎ, defined for some nonpositive φ, be such that 5Κι(φ) with ξ) > 0 and 
®ίΐ(ΐ>) with © < 0 taken together are analytic at § = 0. That this 
analytic continuation is possible can be most easily seen from (5.8), 
where sx and s2 each has at most one zero in the cut eie-plane. For φ 
small, s1 has a zero inside the unit circle, namely, the r of (5.11), and 
s2 has a zero outside the unit circle, namely, 1/r. After analytic continua-
tion to negative small values of φ, 
r > 1, 
(5.41) 
and, still as before, 
si(r) = i2(l/r) = 0. 
(5.42) 
For φ < 0, the difference between SD^ and SJlï is due to the residues at 
r and 1/r; more explicitly, 
» S » ) - 
= 
2 z 
(1/r - r)(l - z2)zi(z§ - z2)2 
χ [(1 + *i)2(z¡ - z2)2 - zld - zi)2d - z2)2]· 
(5.43) 
When —φ is small, the right-hand side of (5.43) is positive and decreases 
with decreasing φ. It reaches zero, as seen from (5.12) and (5.14), at 
- W Γ τ 5 · 
t5·44) 
The situation is thus as shown in Fig. 6.6. 
It is natural to interpret this figure as a hysteresis loop. From (5.44), 
this loop shrinks to the single point φ = 501 = 0 as T-> Γ0". As 
0, 
|z2| is close to 1, and hence by (3.17) 
2*a ~ 1 - |za|.

tion of the first row for El = E2 at T¡T„ = 
0.9. The solid curve is 50ii ; the dotted curve 
shows its analytic continuation. 
Substitution in (5.44) then gives 
M ~ |za|. 
(5.46) 
Thus, in this limit of zero temperature, the hysteresis loop becomes a 
square, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Note that the limit T-*· 0 of the analytic 
continuation of ϋΚ^φ) is different from the analytic continuation of 
lim 2Κι(φ). 
T->0 
It is possible to make this interpretation of the analytic continuation 
much more precise by (1) studying the magnetization in rows other than 
the first and (2) computing the probability distribution function for the 
average spin in row 1. However, we will delay their presentation until 
Chapter XIII. 
D. Numerical Results 
We conclude this discussion of the boundary magnetization by present-
ing in graphical form the results of numerical evaluations of SBljXip). 
In Fig. 6.8, we plot SJii versus ξ> for Ey = E2 = 1 (all energies on the 
scale k = 1) for several values of T. For comparison, we also plot the 
one-dimensional case Ex = 1, Ea = 0 at Τ = 2.498, which corresponds 
to T¡TC =1.1 when Ey = E2. In Fig. 6.9, we plot 
versus T¡TC for 
E¡ = E2 = 1 at ξ) = 0, 0.3, and 1 and we particularly note the smooth 
appearance of the latter two curves at Τ = Tc. In Fig. 6.10, we plot the 
susceptibility χ = ¿'ΏϊιΟξΟ/έ1·© versus Τ and in particular note how the 
logarithmic divergence in χ for § = 0 at Τ = Tc becomes a maximum

in the anti-
ferromagnetic (£i = —Ez = — 1) case versus Τ and finally, in Fig. 6.12, 
we plot χ in the antiferromagnetic case versus T. In this last case, the 
shallow maximum which occurs slightly above Tc at $ = 0 moves below 
Tc as 
is increased and will become a divergence at Τ = 0 when § = 3. 
All of these curves look perfectly smooth at Τ = Tc, even though they 
have infinite second derivatives there.

In this chapter1 we will discuss the spin-spin correlation function of 
two spins in the boundary row [see (II.5.30)],

By a modest extension of the previous techniques we will be able to 
obtain a closed expression for ©ι,ι(Ν, φ) with arbitrary § as a sum of 
three terms each of which involves a product of two integrals. When 
ξι = 0 this result simplifies to a single integral. Therefore, though our 
result is more complicated than the corresponding one-dimensional 
result (III.3.5), it is a great deal simpler than the corresponding result 
for the bulk which involves an Ν χ Ν determinant of integrals.

behavior near § = 0, depending upon whether Τ < Tc, Τ > Tc, or 
Τ = Tc. In this chapter we will study in detail the approach of ©i,i(.N, §) 
to this limiting value. The manner of this approach is quite dependent 
on whether Τ < Tc, Τ > Tc, or Τ = Tc and whether ξ) = 0 or § Φ 0. 
Fortunately the exact form for S1i1(jV, ξ>) is sufficiently simple that 
explicit asymptotic expansion may be made in each of these various 
regions and, furthermore, uniform expansions may be found which 
allow us to connect the various regions together. Moreover, this is the

only example of a correlation function for which all of these Ν » 1 
expansions may be explicitly exhibited near Tc. Therefore in this chapter 
we will present the asymptotic analysis of <Β1Λ{Ν, ξ>) in complete detail 
so that for the more complicated situations of the bulk, where it has so 
far proved impossible to obtain complete results, we will have some 
framework against which the incomplete results may be compared. 
The expansions of this chapter are not technically very difficult to 
carry out, but there are a great many cases to consider. Furthermore, we 
have been unable to find any elegant method for doing the expansions 
and the final results tend to look rather formidable, particularly since 
most of the expansions are carried out to at least two terms. Therefore, 
before we present the details of the calculations, it is extremely useful to 
summarize the various ways in which ©i,i(JV, ·ξ>) may approach its 
limiting behavior at infinite Ν and explain how this behavior depends on 
Τ - Tc, 
and the sign of E1. 
When ξι = 0, Onsager's lattice possesses a symmetry that allows us to 
simply compute a spin-spin correlation function <(aj kar k.') for Εί < 0 
in terms of the value this correlation has for Ex > 0. In the one-dimension 
model this symmetry has already been discussed in Sec. 3 of Chapter III. 
In the present case it is evident that the interaction energy

so that without loss of generality we may restrict our considerations to 
the ferromagnetic case E1 > 0. When φ Φ 0, of course, there is no such 
symmetry and both Ex > 0 and E1 < 0 must be separately investigated. 
The simplest way to summarize the asymptotic behavior of 
(Ν, ξ))

several forms for the asymptotic expansion. When J is fixed and Ν -> cc, 
@i.iW 0) - SK?(0) behaves as 
if Τ > Tc and as N~312^ if 
Τ < Tc. However, it is not possible to obtain the Τ = Tc expansion from 
these expansions simply by setting Τ = Tc because the second term in the 
asymptotic series becomes larger than the first when |Τ — TC\N ~ 1. 
When Τ = Tc and Ν » 1 we must approximate ©i,i(iV, 0) differently and 
find that 
(Ν, 0) behaves as jV _1. These three regions of relatively 
simple asymptotic behavior are connected by two transition regions in 
which IΓ — Tc\ « 1 and Ν» 1 in such a fashion that 
t = (Γ - TC)N 
is of order 1. In this region <5lti(N) is asymptotically expressed as a 
power series in TV-1 whose coefficients are explicitly determined as 
modified Bessel functions or certain integrals of modified Bessel func-
tions. When t—>0, <31Λ(Ν) approaches the Τ — Tc asymptotic value and 
when t -ν ± oo, ©i,i(W) approaches the form that would be obtained by 
letting Τ-*• Tc in the asymptotic expansion obtained for the case Τ φ Tc 
fixed as JV->oo. 
When Τ =TC and 
< 0, @1Λ(Ν, SQ) - 
behaves asymp-
totically for all φ as ( — 1 )"N ~ T h e ferromagnetic case E^ > 0, however, 
is more complicated, and it is useful to summarize the behavior of 
®1Λ(Ν, ξί) for Ν » 1 when Τ = Tc in terms of the diagram of Fig. 7.3. 
There are two regions of simple asymptotic behavior: (1) © φ 0 fixed 
and Ν » 1, where <&1Λ(Ν, ίς>) behaves as Ν'*; and (2) the previously 
discussed case of φ = 0 where <Bltl(N, 0) behaves as N'1. There is a 

[145]

transition region between these two simple cases that occurs when 
§2iV = u is of order 1. In this region <&1Λ(Ν, φ) is expressed as a power 
series in N'1 
whose coefficients are functions of u alone and involve 
products of incomplete gamma functions. When m-> 0, this result 
reduces to the expansion of region 2 and when u -»• oo it reduces to the 
φ -»• 0 form of the expansion of region 1. 
We finally note that when Τ φ Tc and ξ> φ 0, © ^ ( Ν , φ) approaches 
its Ν->co 
behavior exponentially rapidly. When Τ < Tc and Ex > 0, 
the rate of this exponential fall-off depends on & if | £ | is smaller than 
the value at which the analytic continuation of ffllj meets SOlj itself. 
However, when |$| is larger than this value the rate of fall-off depends 
on Τ — Tc alone and not on .£>. For .f> in this regime the asymptotic 
behavior of <ΒιΛ(Ν, φ) — 3Κ?(φ) is quite different from the case φ = 0 
and is summarized in Fig. 7.4.

We have so far discussed the ferromagnetic case and shall now sum-
marize qualitatively the situation with the antiferromagnetic case. When 
Τ < Tc, 
(Ν, φ) - 9Ki(§) does not approach a limit as N-+cc 
but 
rather oscillates as const. (—1)". The approach to this oscillatory 
behavior, however, is the same as the approach of @lfl(N, 0) to

where the first term is recognized as SJif. If ξ> -»• oo, the right-hand side 
of (4.1) goes to 1; so, since we know that &1Λ(Ν, φ) must go to 1 when 
Sq -> co, the plus sign must be chosen in (4.1) when φ is large. Because 
©i,iW Φ) is a continuous function of ξ>, this consideration determines 
the correct sign in (4.1) for all φ unless there is an φ for which 
^(jV, φ) 
vanishes. This only occurs at fixed iV when the lattice is antiferro-
magnetic and Τ < Tc. In this case, when φ is small, <S1A tends to alternate 
in sign. The plus sign in (4.1) still holds but now we will determine it by 
continuity from Τ = 0, where <Β1Λ(Ν, φ) = (— 1)", as is explicitly shown 
later. 
Before we consider asymptotic expansions, it is instructive to look at 
a number of simple limiting cases. To do this in a systematic fashion, and 
also because it clearly exhibits the several types of exponential behavior 
as Ν-*• oo, we will shift the contours of integration of the integrals with 
a term etm in the integrand from the unit circle to the contour Γ which 
goes around the branch cuts of a inside the unit circle. In doing this, we 
pick up contributions from the poles at e'e = 1, — 1, and r. The form of

mined by (VI.5.13) and (VI.5.14). We also rationalize the denominators

We now turn to the question of the behavior of <51Λ(Ν, φ ) for large N.

Ν 1 - z' ,2

(1 - a2)|z2| » 1. 
(4.18) 
In this region, as the expressions (4.3)-(4.8) show, the correlation function 
approaches its limiting value exponentially rapidly. We will compute the 
asymptotic series multiplying the exponential for the several regions 
(4.3)-(4.8) and explicitly exhibit the first few terms. We then will consider 
the region where Τ is near Tc but where (4.18) still holds by assuming 
that Ν is such that 
1 — T/Tc\ is fixed and of order 1. In this case, the 
correlation functions do not approach their limiting value exponentially 
but only as an inverse power of N. The coefficients of the first few powers 
of Ν will be evaluated as functions of jV| 1 — TjTc\. We next examine the 
case where © = 0 and 
— 7/7^1 is of order 1. Here, we obtain 
approximations to the simpler expressions (4.16). Finally, we consider 
the case where Τ = Tc and Nz2 is fixed and of order 1.

We expand ϋ(η) in a power series as

if it is not 1, may always be extended to zero without altering the asymp-
totic series. Integrating term by term, we obtain

C£X = zfc at Tc. We first consider Γ < Tc. Then (4.6) or (4.4) holds. We 
consider only the case in which ζ2 > |z2|(l — α2)/(1 + a2). Then the term 
involving r" in (4.4) is exponentially small compared with the other

1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 
The aim of this and the next four chapters is the discussion of the 
magnetization and the spin-spin correlation functions of Onsager's 
lattice. When the spins involved were in the boundary row we were able 
to make a complete study of these quantities. However, the interest here 
is in the bulk, where the calculations are more difficult and such a com-
plete study does not exist. Indeed, we can make progress only in the 
absence of the magnetic field. Therefore, unlike the situation in the 
boundary row, it is not possible to compute the magnetization M(H) 
simply by differentiating the free energy with respect to H. Likewise, it is 
not possible to compute the susceptibility χ(Η) even at Η = 0 by 
differentiating M(H) with respect to H. In particular, no calculation of 
χ(0) exists, although we shall see in Chapter XII that important informa-
tion about its behavior near Τ = Tc may be obtained from a study of 
<σο,οσΜ.ΛΓ) in the asymptotic region where M 2 + Ν2 is large. 
Since we are restricted to Η = 0, we can use (VII. 1.4) to relate the 
case of negative Ex to that of positive E^. Since this remark also applies 
to E2, we shall without loss of generality assume both E1 and E2 to be 
positive throughout the rest of this book, unless the contrary is explicitly 
stated.

The relation (1.2) has previously been discussed; see (II.5.43). For (1.2) 
to hold, it is necessary that not only the limit on the right-hand side exists, 
but also the more general limit 
lim 
{"a,a"M,N> 
should exist and be independent of the ratio M¡N. The existence of the 
limit in (1.4) will be verified in Chapter XII, where we compute the 
asymptotic behavior of <σ0 0σΜιΝ) for large Μ 2 + N 2. 
It must be strongly emphasized that the existence of the limit (1.4) is 
closely connected with the fact that we are considering Onsager's lattice. 
For most lattices which do not possess the translational symmetry of 
Onsager's lattice, the limits (1.2) and (1.4) do not exist. Therefore, in 
general (1.2) cannot be taken as a definition of the spontaneous magneti-
zation. This point will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter XV. 
The study of the general correlation function <σ0 0σΜι„> is com-
plicated. However, there are two special cases where this correlation 
function possesses the simplifying feature that it may be written as a 
Toeplitz determinant. [A Toeplitz determinant is the determinant of a 
matrix whose elements am>„ are functions of m — η only. See (2.28).] 
These two cases are 
(1) M — 0, Ν arbitrary (or, by symmetry, Ν = 0 and Marbitrary) and 
(2) M — N. 
The Toeplitz determinant for <σ0,οσο,Ν> will be derived in Sec. 2 by a 
straightforward procedure similar to that of Chapter VII, Sec. 2. The 
determinant for <σ0-0σΝ „) is not simply derivable in this straightforward 
manner, and is computed in Sec. 3 by introducing a triangular Ising-
model lattice. However, in compensation for the increased complexity 
of the derivation, the result will be simpler than the corresponding result 
for <σο.οσο,Μ>· The effect of this simplification will be seen in detail in 
Sec. 4 of Chapter XI, where we study the behavior of these correlation 
functions for Τ = Tc. 
The final section of this chapter is devoted to the study of the near-
neighbor correlation functions <σ0 0σ0>1) and <σο,οσι,ι>· 
1. The spontaneous M was originally obtained by Yang without using (1.2); see 
C. N. Yang, Phys. Rev. 85, 808 (1952).

A precise discussion of any bulk quantity requires a specification of the 
boundary conditions satisfied by the lattice. However, if the problem 
under consideration is to be physically interesting, the dependence of 
any bulk quantity on the type of boundary condition imposed should 
vanish as the size of the lattice becomes infinite. In this section we shall 
be very specific about the boundary condition: cylindrical in the hori-
zontal direction and free in the vertical direction. Let the rows be 
numbered —

j < Jl and the columns —JT + 1 < k < ¿V; then 
the columns — oV + 1 and J/~ interact with each other but the rows 
—Jl' and Jt do not. The interaction energy for this lattice is

The insistence on dealing rigorously with the boundary conditions 
forces us to give a derivation of (σ0ι0σ0ι1,) which is slightly more involved 
algebraically than is needed merely to derive the final result. Once we 
have obtained this result, we will see that this same result may be ob-
tained if we adopt a more cavalier attitude toward the boundary condi-
tions. Since this independence of boundary conditions is expected, we 
will use the algebraically simpler approach in Sec. 3. 
From the discussion in Sec. 2 of Chapter V and Sec. 2 of Chapter VI, 
we know that the partition function derived from (2.1) may be written as

To make this expression for <σ0|0σ0 „ ) j t ^ · . ^ explicit we must com-
pute the required inverse matrix elements. Were A a matrix that was 
cyclic or nearly cyclic in both those indices referring to the rows of the

be a simple matter to apply the formulas developed in Sec. 3 of Chapter 
VII to compute its inverse. In fact, A fails to be (nearly) cyclic in the 
indices referring to the rows of the lattice. Therefore, to obtain a rigor-
ously correct answer we will obtain the required matrix elements of A ~1 
by an extension of the calculation of Chapter VII. It is easily verified, 
however, that our final results are identical with those we would obtain 
if we modified A to be (nearly) cyclic in both its indices. The matrix A

In (2.30) the square root is defined so that φ(π) > 0. 
A determinant of the form (2.28) is called a Toeplitz determinant. 
Toeplitz determinants are more general than cyclic determinants, which, 
besides the form (2.28), have the additional restriction that a k 
= 
a N + k . 
The behavior of Toeplitz determinants for large Ν is much more difficult 
to determine than the corresponding behavior of cyclic determinants. The 
next three chapters are concerned with the study of this large-Ν behavior 
of Toeplitz determinants.

The method of computing spin-correlation functions as determinants 
presented in the previous section can be used to produce an expression 
for any spin-correlation function Οο,οσΜ.Λτ>· However, the expressions 
so produced are not at all unique. Even the nearest-neighbor correlation 
function <σ0_0σ0>1>, which is found in (2.28) to be expressible as a single 
integral, has many alternative forms. For example, if, instead of con-
necting the sites (0,0) and (0, 1) by a single bond, we connect them by the 
path with three bonds running from (0, 0) to (1, 0), (1, 1), and finally to 
(0, 1), we can write σ0 οσ ο α = (σ0ι0σ1ι0)(σ10σ1,1)(σ1,1σ0ι1). This represen-
tation of σ0ι0σ0>1 is much more complicated than the single integral we 

[187] 
C O R R E L A T I O N F U N C T I O N S <σ0,ο ®O.N> AND <σ0.0 <7j»,w> 
previously derived, and yet the two expressions obviously must be equal. 
Because of this great arbitrariness in the manner in which the sites are 
connected, it is sometimes not obvious whether or not a given correlation 
function is expressed in the simplest possible form. Indeed, it is sometimes 
possible to simplify a result by seemingly complicating the problem. For 
example, one could compute the boundary spin-correlation function 
®ι.ι(Λ0 at ξ» = 0 by connecting the sites (0, 0) to (0, N) by a straight line. 
This would lead to a 2Ν χ 2Ν determinant. However, as we have seen 
in Chapter VII, if we complicate the problem by introducing the magnetic 
field φ, we immediately obtain &i,i(N, § ) as a 4 χ 4 determinant. The 
© = 0 result was easily obtained by letting © -»- 0. The labor saved in 
following this latter approach is enormous.2 
A similar situation arises in the case of the correlation <<t0 0CTw>jV). A 
straightforward application of the previous procedure is to join the sites 
(0,0) and (Ν, Ν) through the staircase arrangement of bonds (0,0) to 
(0,1), (0, 1) to (1,1),..., (Ν - 1, N) to (Ν, N). This leads to a 4N χ 4N 
determinant. However, we may adopt a different point of view. Instead 
of considering a square lattice we study the triangular lattice3 shown in 
Fig. 8.2. This lattice has bonds of strength Ea connecting the sites (J, k) 
to the sites ( j + 1, k + 1). On this lattice we will compute <σ0 0aw>N)¿ by 
joining (0,0) with (Ν, Ν) by a straight line. We then will recover the 
result for Onsager's lattice by taking the limit E3 
0. This achieves the 
significant simplification of obtaining <σ0-0aN¡Ny as an Ν χ. N Toeplitz 
determinant which is closely related to the determinant (2.28). In fact, 
this new determinant is simpler than (2.28) because its matrix elements 
are computed from formulas like (2.29) and (2.30) with aj = 0. 
2. Both methods of computation have actually been carried out but the analysis 
of the IN κ 2Ν determinant is so tedious that it will forever remain unpublished.

To apply our previous method of computing spin-correlation functions

of this lattice as the Pfaffian of an appropriate matrix. Since this con-
struction is very similar to that of Chapter V, we shall be brief.

and r diagonal bonds. An example of an allowed figure is given in Fig. 8.3.

Fig. 8.3. The triangular Ising counting 
lattice with bond weights zlt z2, and z3. On this 
lattice is shown an example of a closed figure 
that enters the sum (3.2). 
The sum in (3.2) is the generating function for closed polygons on the 
lattice of Fig. 8.3. Since this lattice is planar (with cylindrical boundary 
conditions), we may reduce this problem to a dimer counting problem. 
This relation was simply made for the square lattice in Sec. 2 by drawing 
the cluster of dimer sites that corresponds to one Ising vertex and explicitly 
verifying in Fig. 5.3 that the eight possible arrangements of bonds at the 
Ising vertex are in one-to-one correspondence with the arrangement of 

[189] 
CORRELATION FUNCTIONS <σ0,ο 
AND <σ0.0 
dimers on the dimer lattice. This explicit verification can be done in the 
present case but, since there are now 32 different possible configurations 
of bonds at an Ising vertex, much labor is involved. Therefore it pays to 
be a bit more systematic.4 
We proceed in two steps. First, we replace each vertex of Fig. 8.4(a) by 
the expanded site of Fig. 8.4(6), which has four vertices and three new

internal bonds. The weight associated with the new bonds is 1, so the 
generating function for polygons on this expanded lattice is the same as on 
the original lattice. Now each vertex has three and only three lattice bonds 
attached to it. We next replace each of the three-bond vertices of Fig. 
8.4(¿>) by a Δ-type site with three vertices and three new internal bonds as 
shown in Fig. 8.4(c). By Fig. 8.5, the polygons on the counting lattice of 
Fig. 8.3 are in one-to-one correspondence with the closest-packed dimer 
configurations of the lattice in Fig. 8.6. An example of such a corre-
spondence is shown in Fig. 8.7. Thus we have reduced the computation 
of the sum in (3.2) to the computation of the generating function for 
closest-packed dimer configurations on the lattice of Fig. 8.6. 
The last sentence requires some clarification because the one-to-one 
correspondence is between a polygon of weight z\z\z\ 
and a closest-
packed dimer configuration of weight 
z2 JTU( + M' +1) - v2^JT(Ji + jn-

Therefore the sum in (3.2) is really equal to 
+Jt·+1 >z2-rc<r+jn¿gjrut+ΜΊ 
times the generating function for closest-packed dimer configurations on 
the lattice of Fig. 8.6 with each z, replaced by zf 1. However, since we are 
considering cyclic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction on the 
original Ising counting lattice, the number of bonds at every lattice site is 
4. We follow here the general prescription of Μ. E. Fisher, J. Math. Phys. 7, 
1776 (1966).

that the orientation parity of every elementary polygon is clockwise odd. 
It may easily be verified that one such set of arrows is that of Fig. 8.8.

CORRELATION FUNCTIONS <σ0,0 σ0.κ> AND <®0,o <>N.N> 
But, analogously to what we have seen in Sec. 2 of Chapter V, we may 
perform a set of row and column operations on det ÄA that will reduce 
the computing of the determinant to that of a smaller determinant which 
does not contain the indices 1 — 6. One such set of row and column 
operations is as follows, in the indicated order: 
row 1 is added to 
row 3 
row 3 is added to 
row 5 
row 6 is added to 
row 4 
row 4 is added to 
row 2 
row 1 is subtracted from row L 
row 2 is subtracted from rows U and S 
row 3 is subtracted from row Τ 
row 4 is added to

row 5 is added to 
rows R and D 
row 6 is added to 
row T.

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
We could now continue and explicitly compute the partition function 
for the triangular lattice. However, since our only interest here is 
<σ0 0σ„ιΛ.)Δ in the limit E3 —> 0, we will pass immediately to a discussion 
of correlation functions. Indeed, now that we possess a suitable counting 
matrix Αά, the discussion of the previous section may be taken over word 
for word. In particular, we join the site (0, 0) to (Ν, Ν) on the weighted 
Ising lattice by a straight line and replace all the z3 on the line by zä1· 
Then, in a notation analogous to that of Sec. 2, the matrix yA is

Finally, to obtain an explicit expression for <σ0 0σ„ιΛΓ> from this, we need 
to find formulas for the indicated inverse matrix elements of A0. This 
could be done in a fashion analogous to that carried out in the previous 
section. However, it is simpler to notice that in the limit J(, J t ' , and 
Jf 
oo the matrix elements of A'1 
of the previous section are precisely 
those which would be obtained if A were a cyclic (or nearly cyclic) matrix 
in both the index j which refers to the rows and the index k which refers 
to the columns of the Ising lattice. Therefore, the inverse matrix elements 
of A0, as J(, J(\ 
and Jf all approach infinity, are exactly the same as 
those of the corresponding cyclic matrix. But we have seen in Sec. 3 of 
Chapter VII how to invert a cyclic matrix. Therefore, without further

Our primary interest in spin-spin correlation functions is in their 
behavior when the separation between the spins is large. However, before 
we embark on the study of this asymptotic behavior it is useful to discuss 
briefly the correlation functions of two spins close to each other. 
Consider first the nearest-neighbor correlation function <σ0 0σ0>1>. 
From (2.28) we find that it is

The correlation function <σ0,οσι,ο) is obtained from (4.1) by the replace-
ment E2 
Ex. Therefore, comparing (4.1) with (V.3.64) we find that, as 
expected from (II.5.32), 
U = 
-£ι<σ0,οσο,ι> 
- 
Ε 2 < σ 0 Λ σ 1 ι 0 } . 
( 4 . 2 ) 
The most interesting features of <σ0>0σ0ι1> and <σ0.οσι,ι) are to be 
found near Tc. In particular, both of these correlation functions are 

[200] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
continuous at Tc and their first derivative with respect to Τ diverges 
logarithmically as Τ ^ Tc. Indeed, these not only are properties of 
<σ0,ο°Γο,ι) and <σ0,οσι,ι> but can also be seen to be the case for <σ0ι0σ0Ν>, 
(.<*o,oaN,ti), and even for <CT0i0CTMi„>. To make these properties manifest 
it is sufficient to expand the correlation functions for Τ ~ Tc. This can 
be done directly in terms of the integrals (2.29) and (3.30). However, 
since we are confining our interest to <σ0-0σ01> and <°·ο,οσι,ι>, we will 
study the Τ ~ Tc behavior by first writing <σ0ι0σ0>1> and <σ0 0σ11> in 
terms of complete elliptic integrals and then using the expansion devel-
oped in Chapter V. This has the advantage that we can use tables of 
complete elliptic integrals to obtain rapidly numerical values for the 
correlations. 
The reduction of <σ0>0σ0>1) to complete elliptic integrals has, in effect, 
already been carried out in Chapter V, where u was written in terms of Flj 
and K. Therefore, we find from (V.3.82) that for Τ > Tc 
<σο.οσ0.ι> = (2/-Π-) coth 2βΕ1 cosh 2ßEj. cosh 2ßE2 
χ [nl(sinh2 2ßEu k>) - sech2 IßE,. K(Ar>)] 
(4.3a) 
and from (V.3.103) that for Τ < TQ 
<σο,οσο,ι> = (2M coth2 2ßE1 coth 2ßE2 
χ [n^csch2 2ßEu kK) - sech2 2ßE1 K(/c<)], 
(4.3b) 
where we recall from (V.3.71) that 
k> = sinh 2ßE1 sinh 2ßE2 = k<\ 
(4.4) 
When Ex = E2 we use (V.3.84) to show that if Τ > Tc 
Οο.ο<Ό,ι> = coth 2ßEli + η-1 cosh2 2ßE(2 tanh2 2βΕ - 1)Κ(£>)] 
(4.5a) 
and if Τ < Tc 
<«Ό,ο<Ό.ι> = coth 2ßE[i + π-\2 
- coth2 2ßE)K(k<)]. 
(4.5tí) 
The correlation function <σ0,οσι,ι> is found from (3.29) to be

(4"6) 
When Τ < Tc we reduce this to a complete elliptic integral by first using 
the substitution ζ = e~w and deforming the contour of integration from 
the unit circle |ζ| = 1 to the real axis to rewrite (4.6) as 
1 (k<dij 
1 - k A

<σ0.o <*>.*> A N D <σ0,ο 
we obtain 
<«Ό.ο*μ> = (2A0E(fc<). 
(4.9a) 
Similarly, when Τ > Tc we find 
<*ο.ο«Ί.ι> = (2/Vfc>)[E(/:>) + (fci - 
l)K(fc>)]. 
(4.96) 
The values of <σ0 0σ0>1) and <σ0,οσι,ι> at Tc may now be found from 
the expansions of complete elliptic integrals given by (V.3.46), (V.3.53), 
and (V.3.116). We obtain 
<σ0.ο<Ό,ι> = (2W coth 2ßQEx gd 2ßcEx 
(4.10α) 
and 
<®ο.ο<Ί.ι> = ( 2 W ~ 0.5366198. 
(4.10&) 
In the isotropic case when Ex = E2 we have 
gd 2β0Εχ = π/4 
(4.11) 
and thus (4.10a) reduces to 
<«Ό,ο«Ό,ι> = 1 / V 2 ~ 0.7071067. 
(4.12) 
The logarithmic divergence in the derivative of these correlation func-
tions with respect to Τ is also easily obtained. In particular, from 
(V.3.119) we find that near Tc

The solution of (1.1) is by no means obvious. Therefore, to provide

Because of the conditions (1.4), (1.6), and (1.7), these Fourier series are 
all uniformly convergent for 0 < θ < 2π, so that X(ew), Y(ew), and 
C(e'9) are all continuous (though not necessarily analytic) on the interval 
0 < θ < 2π. Furthermore, because the series are uniformly convergent, 
they may be integrated term by term so that xn is easily obtained from

over m and η because of the uniform convergence of the series for

This formal solution is not necessarily a solution satisfying (1.7) for

It is also true that (1.14) is sufficient for Y(eie)IC(ew) 
to be represented 
as a Fourier series whose coefficients are absolutely summable. The 
necessary theorems are somewhat technical and they will be dealt with 
in the next section. These theorems are also needed to prove that the 
formal solution which we will obtain for the Wiener-Hopf sum equation 
(1.1) is in fact a solution which satisfies (1.3). 
The foregoing discussion of (1.5) suggests that the dependence of 
c„_m in (1.1) on η — m alone may be usefully exploited if we perform a 
Fourier transformation. Since (1.1) holds only for η > 0, we define

By (1.3), (1.2), and (1.18), these three functions of ξ are continuous when 
I = 1. With these definitions, we multiply (1.17) by ξη and sum over 
all η to find that, for

C(£)Jf(6 = 7(£) + V(i). 
(1.22) 
This equation is dramatically different from (1.12). Equation (1.12) 
contains only one unknown function and hence, if (1.14) is satisfied, is 
easily solved. Equation (1.22) contains two unknown functions and hence 
it is by no means clear that it can be solved at all. 
The purpose of this chapter is to explain in detail how this apparent 
difficulty of having one equation for two unknowns may be overcome by 
exploiting the analyticity properties of the four functions in (1.22). More 
specifically, in Sections 3-6, we will find all solutions of (1.1) satisfying 
(1.3) when yn satisfies (1.2), cn satisfies (1.4), and C(0 φ 0 for |f| = 1. 
However, in order to make the work of these sections mathematically 
rigorous, it is necessary to introduce a few theorems of a rather technical 
nature. These theorems are set forth in Sec. 2 and may be omitted if one 
is not overly concerned with technical details.

by eint and sum over η from — oo to +00. Then, because of the absolute 
convergence for real θ of all series involved, 
Therefore we have proved 
Theorem 2. If Fe 1* and Gel* 
then FG e I*. 
To illustrate the uses to which Theorem 2 will be put, consider the 
expression Y(e,$)IC(e's) 
encountered in the previous section. We saw 
there that to demonstrate the validity of our formal solution of (1.5) we 
had to prove that Y(ew)IC(ew) 
e /*. Theorem 2 now guarantees that 
Y(ew)IC(e'e) e I* if Y(ew) e I* and C(eie)_1 e I*. But, by (1.2), Y(ew) e I*. 
Therefore we will have proved that (1.13) is a rigorous solution to (1.5) 
which satisfies (1.3) if we can prove that the conditions C(ew) e I* and 
C(eie) φ 0 for real θ are sufficient to guarantee that C(ew)~1 e I*. This 
result follows as a special case of a much more general theorem of Wiener 
and Lévy. 
Wiener-Lévy Theorem. Let Φ(ζ) be a function analytic in a region R 
and let F(e">) e /* be such that the curve ζ = F(ew), 0 < θ < 2π, lies 
entirely inside the region R. Then ®(f(e i e))el*. 
This theorem is intuitively obvious. However, as is often the case 
with obvious theorems, its proof is highly hontrivial.2 
For the purposes of this book we need, in particular, the two following 
special cases of the Wiener-Lévy theorem: 
(1) If F(ew) e I* and if F(ew) φ 0 for real Θ, then Fie'6)-1 
e I*; this 
is the theorem needed to justify solution (1.13) of (1.5); 
(2) If F(eie) e I* and if In F(ew) is continuous when 0 < θ < 2π then 
In F(e">) e I*. 
The final theorem we will need, to make the work of this chapter 
rigorous, is Pollard's generalization of Cauchy's theorem. 
Pollard's Theorem. If a function /(z) is analytic inside and continuous 
on a simple closed contour C, then 
The generalization this theorem makes over the more familiar theorem 
of Cauchy is that in Cauchy's theorem/(z) is required to be analytic and 
not merely continuous on C. The proof of this theorem is involved and 
will again be omitted.

The functions Χ(ξ) and Υ(ξ) in (1.22) have the property that, for

(3.1) 
n - 0 
with

M 
< 00. 
(3.2) 
When (3.2) is satisfied, the series (3.1) defines a function, called a + 
function, which is analytic for 
< 1 and continuous for |f| < 1. 
Similarly, the V(£) in (1.22) has the property that for 
= 1 it may be 
expanded into a Laurent series 
Σ

n = - co 
where (3.2) is again satisfied. Because of (3.2), (3.3) defines a function, 
called a — function, which is analytic for 
> 1 and continuous for 
> 1, and approaches zero as ξ 
oo. 
We may exploit these analyticity properties of X, Y, and V if we can 
factorize C(£) for 
= 1 as 
a o - ^ ö - w -
1 ) -
1 , 
(3-4) 
where both Ρ(ξ) and g ( f ) are + functions which are nonzero for | f | < 1. 
Such a factorization is called canonical. Clearly Ρ(ξ) and Q(£~r) are not 
unique since we may multiply Ρ(ξ) by a constant c if we also divide 
Q d ' 1 ) by c. For definiteness we will eliminate this trivial ambiguity by 
requiring that g(0) = 1. Then we may write 
Ρ(ξ) = e G+ ( 0 
(3.5a) 
and 
ß i r 1 ) = eG-«>, 
(3.5 b) 
where G+ίξ) 
is a + [ - ] function. 
How can the functions G+(i) and G-(f) be found? Since C(£) is 
always assumed to be nonzero on the unit circle 
= 1, the logarithm 
of C(ew) can always be defined in such a way that it is continuous for 
0 < θ < 2π. The Wiener-Lévy theorem, discussed in Sec. 2, implies 
that In C(i) has a Laurent-series expansion whose coefficients are 
absolutely summable if, in addition to the non-vanishing of C(£) on the 
unit circle, In C(£) is continuous on the unit circle. This condition is 
satisfied if and only if 
In C(e2!") = In C(e°'). 

[209]

More generally, define the index of C(£) by 
ν = Ind C(0 = (1/2«)[In C(e2"') - In C(e°')]. 
(3.6) 
Since C(i) is continuous and nonzero on the unit circle, ν is well defined 
and is in fact an integer. Ind C(£) is the number of times C(f) goes 
around the point C(0 = 0 in the counterclockwise direction when ξ goes 
once around ξ = 0 in the counterclockwise direction with

example, if 
C(f) = p ,

As stated above, if C(£) φ 0 for |£| = 1 and Ind C(f) = 0, then the 
Wiener-Lévy theorem guarantees that In C(£) is of the form (3.9). Thus 
(3.10) may be used to define 
G+(f) = — [In C(0]+ 
(3.12a) 
and 
G.(ß

In practice, for the applications of this book, G+(ξ) and GL(f) will be

However, we shall see that the nature of the solution is quite 
different, depending on whether ν < 0, ν = 0, or ν > 0. Therefore, we

for

being the product of two + 
functions, is a + function. Similarly, ea-<l)V(i) 
is a — function. The 
remaining function eG-(i)Y(¡) is known but is neither a + nor a — 
function. However, by Theorem 2 of Sec. 2, it is of the form (3.9), and 
thus by (3.10) and (3.11) may be decomposed into the sum of a + 
function and a — function. Therefore, for |f| = 1, 
e- e+®*(0 - [e°-«'F(i)]+ = βα-«Ψ(£) + [e°-<«r(f)]_. 
(4.2) 
The left-hand side of this equation defines a function analytic for 
Iii < 1 and continuous for |f| < 1, and the right-hand side defines a 
function analytic for |f| > 1 and continuous for |£| > 1. Since these 
two functions are equal on the circle |f| = 1,

[e°-«>y(f)]+

(4.3α) 
for |£| < 1 and

(4.3 b) 
for \ξ\ > 1 define together a function Ε (ξ) which is (1) continuous for 
all ξ and (2) analytic for all ξ except possibly on the circle |f| = 1. 
However, it may be seen that a function Ε(ξ) with these two properties 
is entire (that is, is analytic in the entire f-plane). 
To see this we use the following well-known theorem from the theory 
of complex variables : 
If in an open set R in the x,y-plane, 
h(x,y) 
has continuous first 
derivatives and satisfies 
8h 
•8h 
,Λ A\ 
(4·4) 
then h(x, y) is an analytic function of χ + iy in R. 
We use this theorem to prove that Ε(ξ) is entire by examining the 
function 
h(x,y) 
=

Ε{ξ')άξ, 
( 4 . 5 ) 
Jp 
where the contour Γ runs from 0 to ξ = χ + iy as shown in Fig. 9.1(a). 
If |f| < 1 we use Cauchy's theorem and the fact that Ε(ξ) is given to be 
analytic for |£| < 1 to conclude that 
h(0

where J is the contour shown in Fig. 9.1(6). Equation (4.6) is also true 
if |i| > 1. To see this, consider the closed contour c shown in Fig. 
9.2(a) made up of Γ traversed from 0 to ξ and J traversed from ξ to 0.

to the unit circle ; (b) the contours c + and c -. 
part of the unit circle in common.) But Ε(ξ) is analytic in the region 
enclosed by c+ and c_ and is moreover continuous on c+ and c_. 
Hence, by Pollard's Theorem, both integrals on the right-hand side of 
(4.7) vanish and therefore (4.6) holds without restriction on ξ. We now 
differentiate (4.5) with respect to x, to find 
8h(x,y) 
dx

E(x

and differentiate (4.6) with respect to y, to find

= 
iE(x

(4.8a) 
(4.86) 
Thus (4.4) is satisfied and, since Ε{ξ) is a continuous function of ξ, we 
conclude from the above-stated theorem that h(x, y) is an entire function 
of ξ. Hence, it follows that Ε(ξ) itself is entire and that both equations 
in (4.3) may be analytically continued to all ξ. 
We can easily determine Ε(ξ). Since Ε(ξ) is entire, the Taylor series

[213] 
W I E N E R - H O P F

must be convergent for all ξ and in particular for

en = 0 
(4.10) 
for all n. Accordingly, 
Ε(ξ) = 0. 
(4.11) 
It follows from (4.11) and (4.3a) that, for 
< 1, 
Χ(ξ) = e° +<»[e c-®7(í)] +. 
(4.12) 
The right-hand side of this expression is the product of two + functions 
and hence, by Theorem 2 of Sec. 2, a + function itself. Thus we may 
invert the Fourier series by means of (1.11) to obtain the desired unique 
solution,

5. Ind C(f) < 0 
This case differs from the preceding one in that the general solution of 
(1.1) now contains —Ind C(f) arbitrary constants and hence is not 
unique. 
We cannot make a canonical factorization of C(f) itself if Ind C(f) = 
ν Φ 0, but we can find a canonical factorization for

(5.2 a) 
and

Therefore we find from (1.22) that, for

The left-hand side of this equation is a + function and thus is analytic

entire function Ε(ξ) such that, for |f| < 1 
- [£-V-«>y(i)]+ 
= Ε(ξ) 
(5.5α) 
and for 
> 1 
+ [Γν«°-<«7(£)]_ = Ε(ξ). 
(5.5 b) 
To determine this entire function Ε(ξ), we first note that the left-hand 
side of (5.56), being a product of ξ~ν with a — function, is of the form 
|v|-l 
Σ 
β . f - 
(5-6)

A comparison of (5.6) with (4.9), the Taylor-series expansion of Ε(ξ), 
shows that Ε(ξ) is a polynomial, 
|v|-l 
E(0 = 2 
(5.7) 
71-0 
and we have no further way of determining an. We thus may substitute 
(5.7) in (5.5a) to find 
Χ(ξ) = eG*(«{[¿-V-<«r(í)]+ 
+ Ε(ξ)} 
(5.8) 
and use (1.11) to obtain the final result

(5.9) 
a result that contains — ν undetermined constants. 
6. Ind C(f) > 0 
This final case to be considered differs from the two previous cases in 
that a solution is possible only if certain extra relations hold between 
Y(ù and C(i). 
As in the previous case, a canonical factorization of C(£) does not 
exist and we consider ξ ' vC(f), which possesses the canonical factorization 
(5.1). Then from (1.22) we obtain for |£| = 1 
- [e G-'«y(0] + = e°-«>K(0 + [e c-'«y(i)]-. 
(6.1) 
The right-hand side of this equation is a — function and the left-hand side 
is a + function, so we argue, as in Sec. 4, that each side is separately 
equal to the entire function Ε(ξ), which is zero. Therefore 
(6.2)

and, since e~G+({) does not vanish for 
< 1, we have 
χ(ξ) = 
rw«[e°-<«r(f)]+. 
The right-hand side of (6.3) is, however, not necessarily a + function. 
In general the Laurent expansion of (6.3) begins with ξ"". To insure that 
Χ(ξ) is a + function we must demand that the Laurent expansion of the 
right-hand side of (6.3) begins with ξ°. Therefore, only if the conditions

As we have stated it, this version of Szegö's theorem is not really a 
theorem at all, because the additional conditions1 on C(e'e) have not 
been given. For the purpose of evaluating M 2 from (1.1) it is sufficient 
to prove Szegö's theorem under the additional hypothesis that, as 
M 
c n = 
O(K-M), 
where Κ > 1. However, (1.7) is much stronger than is necessary. There-
fore, since Szegö's theorem is of independent interest, we will prove in 
Sec. 3 that (1.4) holds under conditions on cn much weaker than (1.7). 
To say that Szegö's theorem is unfamiliar to many physicists is most 
assuredly an understatement. Moreover, the full-blown proof is filled 
with innumerable details and lemmas which often obscure the basic 
point. Were we mathematicians this would pose no problem, since we 
could simply give some references2-5 and let the reader fend for himself. 
However, since we are physicists, we will proceed differently. Instead of 
going directly to the precise statement and rigorous proof of Szegö's 
theorem, which is given in Sec. 3, we will give in Sec. 2 a heuristic 
derivation in which we freely interchange the orders of limiting pro-
cedures and are not attentive to questions of technical detail. In this 
fashion we hope not only to prove that Szegö's theorem is true but also 
to give the reader a feeling of why it is true. The rigorous proof given in 
1. We remark that the condition Ind C(i) = 0 is clearly needed, for otherwise the 
values of μ and gn depend on where we put the discontinuity of In C(e"). Alterna-
tively, we may take the view that, when Ind C(f) φ 0, the sum on the right-hand 
side of (1.4) diverges and we get the uninteresting result lim«-«, ΰκ/μ" = 0.

(A) Behavior of DNjDN+1 for large Ν 
It is difficult to study DN directly because determinants are very com-
plicated objects. However, it is possible to study DN through the connec-
tion that Toeplitz determinants have with Wiener-Hopf sum equations. 
To see this connection define the quantities 
0 < η < Ν, as the solu-
tion of the system of linear equations 
5 
c„-mx™ = δ„,o. 
(2.1) 
m = 0 
These equations uniquely define x ^ if 
Ds +1 Φ 0. 
(2.2) 
If (2.2) is satisfied, then Cramer's rule gives that 
μΝ = DN+1jDN 
= [χΓ]- 1· 
(2.3) 
We are primarily interested in the behavior of μΝ when Ν is large. 
Knowledge of this behavior, although not enough to determine the 
behavior of DN for large N, is sufficient to demonstrate that limw-. „ Ζ)Λ./μ55 
exists. In particular, it is clear that, if limjV^„ 
# 1, then DN must 
tend to zero or infinity as 
oo. 
It is natural to expect that, for at least some class of functions C(ew), 
lim,,-,«, x'o' exists and, moreover, that the limiting value 
4 Γ >

then (2.5) has a unique solution satisfying

(2.7)

More specifically, we have seen that, when C ( e
w ) satisfies (2.6), C(f) has 
the unique factorization (IX.3.4) (up to a multiplicative constant), where 
Ρ ( ξ ) and ζ ) ( ξ ) are both analytic for 
< 1 and continuous and nonzero 
for 
I < 1. Furthermore, the function Υ ( ξ ) defined by (IX. 1.9) is, in 
this application, simply 
Y(& = Σ ί"8«.ο = L

Therefore from (IX.4.13) we immediately find

[β(ί" 1)] + = 0(0),

so that

Since Ρ ( ξ ) is analytic for |f| < 1, we find that 
*ie> = 0(0)Ρ(0)· 
(2.12) 
The right-hand side of this expression is easily computed directly in 
terms of C ( e
w ) using the work of Sec. IX.3. From (IX.3.5), if we use the 
canonical factorization, 
P( 0) = e°+
(m
 
(2.13) 
and 
0(0) = e0-<»> = 1, 
(2.14) 
because G - ( ξ ) is a — function and thus vanishes as ξ

from (IX.3.170), 
G+(0) =

Thus we have the explicit expression

where μ is defined by (1.5). 
The next fact we would like to establish about DN is that 
lim

In particular, to obtain (2.17) we assume there is some N0 such that

< oo. 
(2.20) 
Under suitable restrictions on C(e'$) we will prove in Sec. 3(C) that this 
series does in fact converge. 
The existence of an N0 such that (2.18) is satisfied will be proved for a 
suitable class of functions C(ew) as corollary 1 in the next section. It 
should be remarked at this point, however, that the existence of such an 
N0 is intimately connected with restrictions (2.6) and in particular (2.6b). 
For example, consider the simple case C(ew) = ew for which (2.6e) and 
(2.6c) hold but (2.6b) is violated. The Ν χ Ν Toeplitz determinant 
associated with this function is zero for every Ν because all the elements 
in the first row are zero. 
(Β) Szegô's Theorem 
We must now determine the value of limw_a, 
Again we shall 
not do this directly, but instead shall study the dependence of this 
limiting value on the function C(Ç). For this purpose, consider a second

and study the ratio DN¡DN 
for large N . This ratio may be studied by an 
extension of the previous Wiener-Hopf procedure. If Ds is sufficiently 
simple that it may be explicitly evaluated, the behavior of DN for large Ν 
is thus found. 
To begin with we ask the question how DN and DN are related for 
large Ν if

The precise sense in which (2.31) holds will be discussed in Sec. 3(D). 
To solve (2.32) and (2.33), define y0 by 
Î

(2.34) 
m - 0 
Then (2.34) and (2.33) together form a Wiener-Hopf sum equation. 
Since C(e,e) satisfies (2.6), it follows from (IX.4.13) that (2.33) and (2.34) 
have the unique solution 
*<->(f) - />(ί)[β(?-1)Λ]+ = yoQimO, 
(2.35) 
where we recall that 
X^Ki) = Î 
n - 0 
In order to determine y0 we note that (2.32) is just 
J(0°>(a) = 1. 
(2.36) 
Accordingly, 
yoQ(0)F(a) = 1, 
(2.37) 
and thus 
X(mXi) =

It then follows from (2.30) and (2.31) that 
l i m f = g

We now rewrite (2.39) by explicitly computing Ρ(ξ) in terms of C(em) 
and C(ei9). To do this, recall (1.6) and define similarly

We next consider exactly the same problem except that instead of (2.24)

obtain

Therefore (2.43) holds for this case as well. 
If we use (2.43) a finite number of times, we obtain the following 
result. Let Ds and Dft1·^

elements are the Fourier coefficients of C(e's) and C(ew) respectively, let

To get from (2.53) to Szegö's theorem (1.4), we choose C(ew) to be a

C(ew) = μ. 
(2.54) 
With this choice, DN = μΝ, g¡ = 0 for all / φ 0, and (2.53) reduces to 
(1.4). 
To obtain (1.4), we have interchanged several limiting operations. The 
validity of these interchanges will be studied in the next section. 
3. A R I G O R O U S P R O O F O F S Z E G Ö ' S T H E O R E M

as Ν ο ο . The validity of this expression was first studied by Szegö in 
1952. He proved that (3.1) holds if φ(θ) = C(ew) is real, positive, con-
tinuous, and periodic with period 2π, and if φ'(θ) exists and satisfies the 
Lipschitz condition of order e, 
ΙΦ'(θι) - Φ'(θ2)I < Κ\θ, - θα\>, 
(3.2) 
with Κ > 0 and e > 0. Because of this pioneering work of Szegö, 
generalizations of this theorem which prove that (3.1) holds under other 
(less restrictive) hypotheses on C(ew) are also referred to as Szegö's 
theorem. 
Szegö's original theorem is not good enough for our purposes because 
the function φ(θ) of (VIII.2.30) is not real except for θ = 0 and π. Various 
generalizations of Szegö's work to the case of complex C(ew) and to the 
case of functions which do not necessarily satisfy the Lipschitz condition 
(3.2) have appeared in the mathematical literature. We will not prove the 

[225] 
S P O N T A N E O U S 
M A G N E T I Z A T I O N 
most general of these theorems. On the other hand we wish to avoid giving 
the reader the false impression that all the conditions which we will 
impose on C(eie) to secure the validity of (3.1) are actually necessary. In 
fact, necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of (3.1) are not 
known. Therefore we mention the following results which are the best 
that presently exist. 
(A) Hirschman4 proved in 1965 that (3.1) holds when C(ew) satisfies 
the following requirements : 
(!') Σ,"-— kn| < CO, 
(2') 2n œ=-»«kn| 2 < 
(3') C ( 0 Φ 0 for |i| = 1, 
and 
(4') Ind C(i) = 0. 
(B) Devinatz5 proved in 1967 that (3.1) holds for a slightly wider 
class of functions. He requires that 
(1") C(£) is continuous and nonzero for \ξ\ = 1, 
(2") Ση"=-»«Κ| 2 <00, 
(3") Ind C(0 = 0, 
(4") The function £»= _ „ (sgn n)cneine is continuous. 
For the purposes of this book there is nothing to be gained by including 
the extra details needed to prove either Hirschman's or Devinatz's form 
of Szegö's theorem and we will content ourselves with the following 
slightly less general version: 
Szegö's Theorem. Let C(ew) = φ(θ) be such that: (1) In φ(θ) is con-
tinuous and periodic for 0 < θ < 2π, and (2) φ'(θ) exists and satisfies 
the Lipschitz condition of order e, 
| f ( f i ) - < m ) | < K\ex - θ 2\\ 
(3.3) 
where 0 < 
Then (1.4) holds. 
Our proof will consist of separate demonstrations of the several 
assumptions made in the previous section. 
(2?) Proof that DN Φ 0 and that limN_,œ μΝ = μ 
The first assumptions of the previous section which we will prove are 
(i) that there exists an N0 such that, for all finite Ν satisfying Ν > N0, 
ΰ Ν φ Ο [see (2.18)] and (ii) that as N ^ oo,

0 < η, are defined as the solutions of

However, for the moment it is convenient to let yn be arbitrary, subject 
only to the condition 
Σ b.l < °°·

We then will have proved assumption (i) if we can show that if yn 
satisfies (3.7) and C(eie) satisfies conditions (1) and (2) then (3.4a) has a 
unique solution if Ν is sufficiently large. 
To study the uniqueness of the solution of (3.4a) we first prove that 
the Wiener-Hopf sum equation (3.4b) has a unique solution. By the 
result of Sec. 4 of Chapter IX this uniqueness will follow if we can show 
that (IX. 1.4) is satisfied, that is, that

Lemma 1. If/(0) satisfies the Lipschitz condition 
ΙΛΘ,) - f(6,)\ < m 
- θ2\% 
(3.9) 
then /„, the Fourier components of/(0), satisfy 
fn = 0(\n\~€) 
as 
| « | ^ o o . 
(3.10) 
Proof. By definition, 
/ . - ¿ f 
(3-10 
But if we replace θ by θ + π/η we also have 
^ =

(3·12) 
Adding these two expressions and dividing by 2 gives 
+ 
(3·13) 

[227]

M A G N E T I Z A T I O N 
Therefore, since f ( f f ) obeys (3.9), 
w 
* 
- / ( ' + 
= ) ! * £ 
which proves the lemma. 
Lemma 1 and condition (2) guarantee that the Fourier coefficients of 
φ'(θ) are of order 0(\n\~£) as |n| -> oo. Therefore the Fourier coefficients 
of φ(θ) are of order 0(|n| ~ 1 _ e) as |n| ->- oo and hence (3.8) is satisfied. 
We now may prove a theorem from which the assumptions (i) and (ii) 
will follow as simple corollaries. 
Theorem 1. If y„ are given, if C(ete) satisfies conditions (1) and (2), 
and if χ'"' satisfies (3.4a), then there is some Κ > 0 and some N0 > 0, 
both of which may depend on r in such a way that for all Ν > N0

the Fourier coefficients of the function f{eie). Then we define

This expression will be called an r norm. It has the following two useful 
properties, which we will often use 
(1) Minkowski's inequality, 
| | / + g | | , < II/II.+ ||g||, 
(3.17) 
The proof of this inequality is well known and will be omitted. The 
existence of this triangle inequality and the fact that [|/||r = 0 if and1 only 
if f(ew) is zero except on a set of measure zero are the reasons that the 
object defined by (3.16) is entitled to be called a norm. 
(2) If 
\\g\U < oo, then 
||/g||r < \\fUg\U. 
(3.18) 
This inequality is not so well known as that of Minkowski. However, 
it follows at once from the well-known Holder's inequality, which states 
that if r and s are positive and satisfy 
1 + 1 = 1 , 
(3.19)

(3.14) 
and if a(ew) and b(ew) are such that

Then we may Fourier transform (3.4a) and obtain for |f| = 1

(3.34) 
By condition (1), C(£) φ 0 for

From Lemma 1 we saw that

(3.36) 
so that it follows from conditions (1) and (2) on C(e") and the Wiener-
Lévy theorem that

be factored [see (IX.3.4)] for | f | = 1 as 
[ c c a r 1 = P{è)Q{tl),

where Ρ{ξ) and Q(£) are both analytic for

nonzero for |f[ < 1, and satisfy 
||β(έ)|ι < » 
and 
| P ( a | | x < c o .

(3.41) 
We apply the Wiener-Hopf argument of Sec. 4 of Chapter IX to this 
equation by noticing that the left-hand side is analytic inside the unit 
circle, whereas the right-hand side is analytic outside the unit circle and 
approaches zero as ξ -> oo. Therefore

Not only is Χ(Ν\ξ) a + function but so also is f *<">(£-1). Therefore, 
we may replace ξ by ξ'1 in (3.34), multiply by ξΝ, and apply an argument 
similar to the foregoing to find

From (3.40) we conclude that the Fourier series for P(ew) is absolutely

Then, since

[ ^ ( δ ί Γ 1 ) ) ^ " ] - = 0,

But since K u K2, K3, and Ké are positive numbers independent of i, é

(3.49) 
Therefore we may solve the simultaneous inequalities (3.48) to obtain 
the desired inequalities (3.38), which completes the proof of the theorem. 
The proof of assumption (i) now follows as a simple corollary of 
Theorem 1. 
Corollary 1. If C(eie) satisfies conditions (1) and (2), then there exists 
an N0 such that, for every finite Ν satisfying Ν > N0, DN Φ 0. 
Proof: If DN+1 
= 0 there exists a solution x'*' to the set of equations 
(3.4a) with yn = 0 for 0 < η < Ν such that 
0 < J 
K > | r ^ Κ J

(3.50) 
n=0 
n=0 
which is a contradiction. Hence the corollary follows. 
Corollary 1 guarantees that the ratios DN+1/DN 
= μΝ exist for all 
sufficiently large N. Therefore we may 
proceed 
to prove 
that 
limw_K μΝ = μ. We first prove 
Theorem 2. If x(

The proof of assumption (ii) now follows as a simple consequence of

But from (2.3) we recall that x'0

(1.5) that jk'o"' = μ'1. Furthermore, Sec. 4 of Chapter IX guarantees that

Thus we have established that

(C) Proof that 
|1 - μ/μΝ\ < co 
The next assumption of the previous section which must be proved is 
(2.20), namely, that if C(ew) satisfies conditions (1) and (2) and N0 is such 
that Dn φ 0 for Ν > N0 then

μ« = μ + 0(N 
Therefore, 
(3.56) 
As seen in (2.19), this statement guarantees the existence of limN-. „ ΏΝ/μΝ. 
Furthermore, from (3.56) we immediately obtain the weaker statement 
that, as N->co,

In (μΙμΝ) = θ(Ν~1)

This fact will be needed in subsection (D). 
We establish (3.56) by using the bound on |1 — μ/μΝ\ given by (3.54) 
in conjunction with the expression (2.11) for x'n

condition (3.3). To do this we establish the following theorem due to 
Privalov: 
Theorem 3 (Privalov's). If fix) satisfies a Lipschitz condition of order 
e, where 0 < e < 1, that is, if

Consider h > 0 (since the proof for h < 0 is identical). We first show that 
if in the integrals of (3.63) and (3.65) the integration is carried out over 
the interval (—2h, 2h) then the integrals are of the order 0(he). This 
follows for (3.63) since

The following lemma is now a simple consequence of Privalov's 
theorem. 
Lemma 2. If In φ(θ) is continuous and periodic for 0 < β < 2π, if 
φ'(θ) exists and satisfies the Lipschitz condition (3.3), and if 
φ(θ)~ί = P(e">)Q(e-">),

then as η —> co

gn =

where pn and qn are the Fourier coefficients of P(ew) and Q(e,e). 
Proof. We consider only pn, since the proof for qn is identical. From 
(IX.3.5) and (IX.3.17) we see that, for \ξ\ < 1, 
= 
( 3 · 8 1 ) 
where, if

The last integral is of the type considered in Privalov's theorem. 
In order to apply the Lipschitz condition (3.3) to (3.84) we differentiate 
with respect to θ to find 
(3.84) 
(3.85) 
To obtain (3.85) we have interchanged the order of differentiation and 
integration. However, since φ(θ) Φ 0 and φ'(θ) satisfies (3.3), φ'(θ)Ιφ(θ) also 
satisfies (3.3) with e > 0. Therefore, Privalov's theorem implies that the 
integral in (3.85) is a continuous function of Θ. Furthermore, since 
Φ'(Θ)ΙΦ(Θ) satisfies (3.3), the integrand in (3.85) is integrable with respect 
to θ for —ιτ< θ < π and also the double integral with respect to θ and 
Θ' exists. Therefore, (3.85) holds. 
But Privalov's theorem does more than just guarantee that (3.85) is 
valid. It guarantees that the right-hand side of (3.85) satisfies a Lipschitz 
condition of order 0 < e < 1. 
However, the fact that P(e">)~ 1{dP(ei<3)¡'áe) satisfies a Lipschitz condi-
tion with 0 < « guarantees that 8P(eis)j8e exists for 0 < θ < 2π. There-
fore, P(eie) must obey a Lipschitz condition with e = 1, so we conclude 
that

To begin with, we remark that conditions (1) and (2) guarantee that 
the infinite series on the right-hand side of (3.95) converges. We do this 
by first proving 
Lemma 3. If In f ( f f ) is continuous and periodic for 0 < θ < 2π and if 
/'(θ) obeys the Lipschitz condition (3.3), then, as |«| ->• oo, 
¿

(3.97) 
But/'(Ö) satisfies the Lipschitz condition (3.3) and/(0) # 0, so f'(6)jf(ff)

THE T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L

and conclude 
that, as |n| -»- oo, 
1 Γ2π 
dde~ine \ n f ( f f ) = n _ 10(|«| _ t) = 0(|n| _ 1" €), 
(3.98) 
which proves the lemma. 
In the case of interest we note that, since by hypothesis the function 
φ(θ) satisfies the Lipschitz condition (3.3), Lemma 3 guarantees that 
gn = 0([n|~ l" e) 
as 
|ji|-*oo. 
Therefore the convergence of the series in (3.95) follows. 
Now that we have proved that conditions (1) and (2) are sufficient to 
guarantee that both sides of (3.95) exist, we turn to the proof that these 
conditions are also sufficient to guarantee that the two sides of (3.95) are 
equal. To construct such a proof we first prove 
Theorem 4. If C(ew) satisfies conditions (1) and (2), then for all 
sufficiently large Ν there exists a polynomial of the jVth degree, 
BŒ\ew)

Proof. Denote by 
the Fourier coefficients of Bm(ew). 
Then 
(3.102) may be rewritten as 
2 
ck.mBT 
= μΝ Κ,ο. 
(3.103) 
m = û 
This equation has a unique solution if DN+1 Φ 0 and, since C(e'°) 
satisfies conditions (1) and (2), Corollary 1 guarantees that ΰ Ν + 1 φ 0 
for all sufficiently large N. Indeed, μΝ ίΒ^ ) satisfies precisely the same set 
of equations (2.1) as does x(„\ Therefore, at least for all sufficiently 
large N, 
¿C» = μ ΝχΤ· 
(3.104) 
In particular, since from (2.3) *j,W) = μή1, 
B<om = 1. 
(3.105) 
Moreover, if we use (3.104) and (2.11) in (3.51) we see that, as N - * oo,

Therefore Β(Ν)(ξ) converges uniformly to μΝΡ(ξ) when |f| < 1. But Ρ(ξ) 
has no zeroes for |f| < 1. Thus, for sufficiently large Ν, ΒίΝ)(ξ) has no 
zeroes for

In a manner identical to the proof of Theorem 4 we also establish that 
for sufficiently large Ν there exists a polynomial of the Mh degree,

that these 2(N + 1) vectors span the 2N + 1-dimensional space spanned

Clearly 2(N + 1) vectors in a space of 2Ν + 1 dimensions cannot be

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
Before we leave the subject we wish to make a few remarks on the 
differences between the weaker version of Szegö's theorem derived here 
and the stronger theorems proved by Hirschman4 and by Devinatz.5 
We first remark that the condition of Hirschman and of Devinatz, 
J 
« Ν 2 < oo, 
(3.140) 
n= — α> 
is certainly weaker than our condition that dC(ete)/de satisfy a Lipschitz 
condition of order e where e > 0. Indeed, we proved from Lemma 1 
that under conditions (1) and (2) as η -*• co 
cn = Ο(|«|- 1"0. 
(3.141) 
This certainly guarantees that (3.140) holds. However, the function 
defined by 
fn1'2 
if η = m3 when m = 1,2,... 
.„ , 
C" = \ 0 
otherwise 
( 3" 1 4 2 ) 
demonstrates that (3.140) may hold even if (3.141) is violated. 
There are several places in our proof where the Lipschitz condition 
has been used, of which the most essential was in the derivation of the 
result 
μΝ = μ + o(N-1), 
(3.143) 
which was needed to pass from (3.138) to (3.139). How the use of the 
Lipschitz condition can be removed is thoroughly discussed in the 
original papers of Hirschman4 and Devinatz.5 
We terminate our remarks on Szegö's theorem at this point and return 
from this mathematical interlude to the calculation of the spontaneous 
magnetization.

The spontaneous magnetization is now simply obtained by applying 
Szegö's theorem (1.4) to the Toeplitz determinants (VIII.2.28) and 
(VIII.3.29). Consider first the more complicated correlation function 
<σο,οσο,ΐί) as given by (VIII.2.28). We may apply Szegö's theorem when 
Τ <TC, a2 < 1, since it is easily verified that φ(θ) defined by (VIII.2.30) 
satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of the previous section.

Thus, for any ratio ErjE2 > 0, the spontaneous magnetization vanishes 
as Τ T é as a one-eighth root. This is to be compared with the boundary

since one expects that the more neighbors a spin has the greater the 
average value of that spin should be. Such an intuitive statement can be 
given a precise statement and a general proof. This is done in Appendix A. 
In Chapter XIII, in the course of our discussion of the hysteresis type 
of phenomena exhibited by SDÎiOë), we derive an expression for the 
spontaneous magnetization 3JÎ/ in the Jth row of the half-plane Onsager 
lattice. From that expression we conjecture that for every finite value of 
J, as Γ - > T„

Furthermore, although no one has succeeded in providing a proof, it is 
physically obvious that for fixed Τ 
lim ailj = M.

Hence (4.13) and (4.14) show that, although the quantity 
lim Wj(Tc - 7*)"1,2 
(4.15) 
T-Tc 
exists for each J, it is unbounded as J-*· oo. This unboundedness means 
that as T ^ - T c the influence of the boundary "penetrates" further and 
further into the lattice. Such a "penetration" of the influence of the 
boundary into the bulk is intimately connected with the pole divergence 
in the boundary specific heat found in (VI.4.43). 
Though M(H) is not known as a function of H, it has been possible to 
evaluate M at one particular value of H other than H = 0, namely,10·11 
Ή = i f r j ß . 
(4.16) 
Note that the value of this magnetic field depends on temperature. Since 
this magnetic field is purely imaginary, the corresponding magnetization 
is not physically observable. This magnetization is more difficult to 
compute than M was because M(i\-π/β) is expressible not as the limit 
Ν ->· oo of an Ν χ TV Toeplitz determinant, but as the limit Ν 
oo of 
an Ν χ Ν block Toeplitz determinant, that is, a determinant of the 
Toeplitz form except that the matrix elements cn are no longer numbers 
but are 2 x 2 
matrices. Such an unpleasant situation would have 
occurred in the computation of this chapter were it not for the fortunate 
fact that 
A-^O, k; 0, k')RR = Λ_1(0, k; 0, k')LL = 0. Since coupled 
Wiener-Hopf equations are in general not explicitly solvable, no analogue 
of Szegö's theorem exists for block Toeplitz determinants and at several 
points in the remainder of this book we will not be able to carry out some 
desired calculations precisely because block Toeplitz determinants are

Our final remark is the obvious and at the same time profound ob-
servation that Tc, which has here been shown to be the temperature at 
which M vanishes as Τ is increased from zero, is the same Tc as that 
found in Chapter V at which the specific heat becomes logarithmically 
infinite. It would seem inconceivable that these two temperatures could 
be different. Therefore, it would be most useful if a proof could be 
constructed which would establish the identity of these two temperatures 
without first having to compute explicitly both c and M. One would 
further expect that if such a proof exists for the Ising model it should 
be generalizable to a wide class of other more realistic magnetic systems. 
Unfortunately, no such proof has yet been found. Therefore, we have no 
fundamental understanding of how, or even if, the singularity in the 
specific heat is related to the vanishing of the spontaneous magnetization.

We continue the study of <σ0,οσο,,ν> and <σ0 0σΝ>Μ) in this chapter by 
considering their behavior when Ν is large and Τ is fixed. The leading 
term is, of course, M 2. In order of increasing complexity, we treat three 
cases : Τ > Tc, Τ < Tc, and Τ = Tc. In the first two cases, we will study 
first <σ0,0σο,;ν> and then obtain <σ0,οσΝ,Ν> by making the replacement 
indicated in (2) above. For the case Τ = Tc, however, the asymptotic 
expansion of <<j0,octo.n) is much more difficult to obtain than that of 
Οο,οσ,ν,.ν)· Accordingly, the expansion at Tc of <σ0 0σΛ, „> will be studied 
by itself in Sec. 4. This expansion will then be combined with a generaliza-
tion of Szegö's theorem in Sec. 5 to obtain the leading term of the ex-
pansion of <σ0,0σο,Ν>· The computation of higher-order terms in the 
expansion of <σ0 0σ0ιΛ,) is more involved and is carried out in Sees. 6 
and 7. 
The three cases have the following qualitative differences : 
(a) When Τ > Tc, we have 0 < «j < 1 < a2 
and 
In φ(2π) - In 0(0) = 
-2πί; 
(b) When Τ < Tc, we have 0 < αχ < a2 < 1 and 
In φ(2π) - In φ(0) = 0; 
and 
(c) When Τ = T„ we have o^ < a2 = 1 and 
ΦΦ) = ~φ( 2π) = 
-i. 
All three cases will be investigated by an extension of the Wiener-Hopf 
technique of Chapter IX, and these qualitative features determine the 
type of procedure to be used. A general discussion of the results obtained 
will be deferred until the next chapter, when we will have generalized 
some of this work to <σ0ι0σΜιΚ>.

2. SPIN CORRELATIONS ABOVE THE CRITICAL 
TEMPERATURE 
We treat first the case Τ > Tc. From the theory of the Wiener-Hopf 
sum equation, it is convenient to work with a kernel whose index is zero, 
that is, a kernel with the property that its logarithm is continuous and 
periodic. Because of (1.7), we introduce

Let Rn be the Ν χ Ν Toeplitz determinant formed from bn, that is, 
Rv is given by the right-hand side of (1.1) with all the a's replaced by 
b's. Szegö's theorem can be immediately applied to RN to give 
lim ( - i y % , = « - " K ' - à K ' - S '

(2.4) 
For large N, the difference between RN and this limiting value is ex-
ponentially small in N. 
Consider the linear equations

£„-m4?> = Sn,0

m-0 
for 0 < η < Ν. Because of (2.3), we may use Cramer's rule to see that 
SN is given by 
SN = (-\yRN+1xT. 
(2.6) 
To determine SN asymptotically, it is therefore sufficient to find χ'κ) for 
large N. For this purpose, we develop first the Wiener-Hopf procedure 
in a form suitable for iterations. In so doing, we will for convenience 
repeat some of the definitions and equations of Chapter X. 
As a generalization of (2.5), consider the equation

It then follows from (2.7) that, for |£| = 1,

Under the present assumptions, C(f) has a unique factorization, up to a 
multiplicative constant, in the form 
[Ctf)]"1 = P W Q d - 1 ) 
for |f| = 1, such that Ρ(ξ) and Q(£) are both analytic for |£| < 1, and 
continuous and nonzero for |£| < 1. Equation (2.16) can thus be 
rewritten in the form 
[ / » ( f ) ] - 1 ^ ) - [ ß ( r w ) ] + - 
[ ß ( r l ) t / ( ö ^ ] +

those terms in which ξ is raised to a nonnegative (negative) power. We 
then apply the standard Wiener-Hopf argument by noticing that the 
left-hand side of (2.18) is analytic inside the unit circle, whereas the right-
hand side is analytic outside the unit circle and furthermore approaches 
zero at infinity. Therefore

These are the equations that we shall use. They are precisely equations 
(X.3.42) and (X.3.43).

where the integration is around the unit circle. In (2.27), the symbol = , 
as introduced in Chapter VII, means that, for Ν -> oo but Τ fixed, the 
right-hand side and the left-hand side have the same asymptotic ex-
pansion. More explicitly, by (2.22) and (2.23),

The error involved in (2.28) is exponentially small in Ν even when com-
pared with x^K In (2.28A), the minus sign on the right-hand side is due 
to the fact that, from (2.1), the square root under the integral of (2.28e) 
is taken to be negative at the point ξ = — 1. Finally, the substitution of 
(2.4) and (2.28) in (2.6) gives

Equation (2.29) is the desired answer; it only remains to evaluate its 
right-hand side asymptotically for large N. This is straightforward but 
tedious. We deform the contour of integration around the branch cut

From this point on, we can proceed in many slightly different ways. For 
example, the simplest thing to do is to expand the integrand of (2.30) 
about the point ξ1 = 1 and then integrate term by term. We shall follow 
the procedure used in expanding similar integrals in Chapter VII, which 
is only slightly different. As in Sec. 5 of that chapter, let

here the equations

The procedure to be followed is: (1) calculate V ( f ) approximately from 

[258] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING

(2.20α) with the ΙΙ(ξ) term neglected; (2) get υ(ξ) from (2.206) with the 
F(0 of step 1 ; and finally (3) compute JST(0) from (2.19a) with the U(£) 
of step 2. We therefore see that the case Τ < Tc is more complicated 
than Τ > Tc in two respects: first, one more step is needed here to get 
x'a \ and secondly, from (3.3) an infinite product of the x(oV)'s is required 
to obtain SN. 
Equations (2.24) and (2.25) still hold here. By (2.20Z>),

with the double integral, or roughly of the order of a\N. The double

In both (3.13) and (3.14), the path of integration for the variable ξ' is to 
be indented outward near ξ = ξ. Equation (3.14) is the desired answer, 
but it remains to evaluate the right-hand side more explicitly for large N. 
Since the authors are unable to find any elegant way of carrying out 
this evaluation, we shall proceed by brute force. We deform the contour 
of integration in the variable ξ around the branch cut from ax to a2, 
that in the variable ξ' around the cut from l/a2 to 1 ¡alt and change the

But the degree of this polynomial is 2[N(N - l)/2] = Ν2 - N. Thus PN 
must equal the polynomial in (4.12) up to some multiplicative constant 
AN which is independent of μ0,..., 
μΝ and v0,..., 
vN but may depend 
on N. However, we may easily show that AN = 1 for all N. Clearly, 
A1 = I. But if we multiply the last row of det M by μΝ_x and then allow 
first μ Ν-ι and then 
to approach oo, we find 
detjv M - > detw_! M.

Because (5.1) is discontinuous at θ = 0, we cannot apply the procedures 
of Sees. 2 or 3. However, the discontinuity at θ = 0 is of the same type 
as that studied in the previous section. Indeed, the ratio 
(5.3) 
is a function which is analytic for 0 < θ < 2π. Furthermore, has 
just been calculated. Therefore to compute SN it is sufficient to compute 
SNIS(ß\ This ratio can easily be found by an application of (X.2.53), 
which is a generalization of Szegö's theorem. Note that while Szegö's 
theorem is proved rigorously in the previous chapter, no corresponding 
proof of (X.2.53) that is general enough for the present purpose exists.

The computation of the previous section is sufficient only to give the 
leading term in the expansion of SN/Sas

with the other expansions of this chapter, which could, in principle, be 
used to compute all terms in those expansions. Accordingly, we conclude 
this chapter with the study of the higher-order terms in SN¡S(x> as JV-»· oo. 
The computation is extremely laborious. Moreover, the methods in-
volved are not used in the remainder of this book. Therefore, while we

So far, no approximation has been made and (7.22) is exact. Since 
(7.26)-(7.29) are rather complicated, we restrict our attention to asymp-
totic expansions for large N. As dn is exponentially small for large |n|, 
(7.26)-(7.29) are much simpler asymptotically. We need to keep only the 
first two terms in (7.26) and (7.29), and only the first term in (7.27) and

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
(Strictly speaking, (7.32) is not valid if m is close to Nx and η close to 
Ν2, and (7.33) is not valid if m is close to N2 and η close to Nx. However, 
these elements of the matrices do not contribute to the asymptotic 
expansion of á?.) 
Let ä'pn and 
be respectively the asymptotic series for d'vn and d"vn 
for large Ν and fixed ρ and n. Thus d'm and 
are defined, term by term, 
for all ρ and all n. Similarly, let Β%'η\ i = 1,2 and j = 1, 2, be the asymp-
totic series for B'Jß, again for large Ν and fixed m and n. Thus B<J£ is 
defined, term by term, for all m > 0 and all η > 0. We can accordingly 
form the infinite matrices Bw), term by term, in powers of TV-1. The row 
and column indices for BiW each run from zero to infinity. In the same 
fashion, we define infinite column matrices y<0 from the y(i) of (7.23) and 
(7.24), again as asymptotic series in N ' 1 . With the help of these infinite 
matrices and (7.22), we get asymptotically 
0t = {(2?α1> - #"2ί}<12>ί?<22)-1£<21))-1-α> 
- N-2ß(ll)-lßa2)0(22) 
_ Ν-2β(21>β(11>- 1£<12>) - ψ2)}0. 
(7.35) 
(It is worthwhile to keep in mind that infinite matrices may not be 
associative.) 
Let Ä be the infinite matrix whose elements are 
Ämn = 4?»„ = 2/[π(2τη - 2 n + 1)] 
(7.36) 
for m > 0 and η > 0, and let AT be the transpose of Ä. We also define 
= ÄBa» 
(7.37) 
and 
= ÄTB(22\ 
(7.38) 
Therefore the required matrices 5 < 1 1 ) _ 1 and B{22)_1 
are 
g a i i - i = j k d - I ^ 
(7.39) 
and 
¿12V-1 = J.(2)-l

Both (7.42) and (7.43) are to be understood in the sense of term-by-term 
equality for each power of JV"1. 
A very similar calculation yields 
(Âyw)n = δη,„. 
(7.44) 
Unlike (7.42) and (7.43), (7.44) does not involve Ν and hence is exact. 
With this result (7.35) can be written alternatively in the form 
01 = {(1 - Ν- 2Β α ι )- 1Β α 2 )Β { 2 2 )- 1Β^ 1 ))- 1» 1' >-' ί} 0 0 - N~2

(7.45) 
We have kept the entire asymptotic series so far. From here on, we 
shall keep only enough terms to get (7.1). For this more limited purpose, 
we write

(7.49) 
We need to calculate each of these three 
to the accuracy N~3 for 
large N. 
It is useful to note, in connection with (7.42) and (7.43), that it follows 
from (7.30) that 
äU = dv.n[ 1 + ΪΝ-Ηρ 
-n) 
+ 
0(N-2)], 
and 
ä;n = d.p+n[l

(7.50) 
where 
Ν = Ν + 0(1). 
(7.51) 

[276]

We therefore define an infinite matrix Si, for m > 0 and η > 0, by

( ?· 5 2) 
Thus, to order N ' 1 ,

(7.53) 
This approximation (7.53) may be used in (7.48) and (7.49) for the 
purposes of obtaining 
and 
but is not accurate enough for Stx as 
given by (7.47).

Suppose that we define Ρ and Q on the basis of (2.17) using this C(f) of 
(7.58), then one possible choice is

(7.72) 
On the other hand, note that the term Ñ ' 1 is missing on the right-hand 
side of (7.69). Thus it is sufficient, for the purpose of obtaining (7.1), to 
use 
Ñ = N + l 
(7.73) 
By (7.71), (7.42), and (7.52), we have, to the required accuracy,

Therefore, the required 3$x is

The point of greatest importance here is that, whereas the right-hand side 
of (7.79) has a branch cut from 1 to infinity, the right-hand side of (7.80) 
is analytic in the region

where <j>_ denotes a contour integral in the counterclockwise direction 
along a circular path of radius between ai and 1. Note that the integrand 
in (7.83) is positive for «1 < ξ < 1. 
With (7.65) and (7.83), the evaluation of 3tx by (7.78) is straightforward 
but tedious. By (7.50), it is convenient to rewrite (7.78) in the form

It is difficult not to be impressed by the remarkable amount of cancella-
tion. We now recall the definition of St as given by (7.11) and we find that

The multiplicative constant is then found to be

Asymptotic Expansion of <σ0 0σ Μ Λ ί) 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 1 
In the previous chapter we studied for fixed Τ the asymptotic behavior 
of <σ0,οσο,Ν> and <σ0 0σΛ· Λ,) as Ν o o . In this chapter we shall give the 
asymptotic form of the correlation function <σ0 0σΜ Ν) for arbitrary M 
and Ν when Μ 2 + Ν2 is large. Since the case M — 0 or JY = 0 is 
already treated in Chapter XI, we shall, without loss of generality, 
assume both M and Ν to be positive. As in Chapter XI, we have to 
treat the three cases Τ < Tc, Τ > Tc, and Τ = Te, separately. We shall, 
however, give the asymptotic form of the correlation function only 
for the cases Τ < Tc and Τ > Tc, where the results in Chapter XI can 
be regarded as a special case of those here. The asymptotic form 
of <"o,o"M,¡¿> for arbitrary M and Ν at Τ = Tc cannot be given because 
it is not known. 
The computations involved in this chapter are more complicated than 
the corresponding calculations for Τ < Tc and Τ > Tc of the previous 
chapter. The reason is that the correlation function cannot be expressed as 
a Toeplitz determinant. Furthermore, the final expressions of <σ0 0σΜ „) 
for Τ < Tc and Τ > Tc are quite messy. 
We conclude this chapter with a discussion of the more qualitative 
aspects of the correlation function computed in this and the previous 
chapter. In particular, we make comparisons with the boundary correla-
tion functions of Chapter VII and speculate about some of those aspects 
of the correlation functions we have been unable to compute explicitly, 
such as the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility as T-> Tc. 
1. This chapter is based on the work of H. Cheng and T. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 164, 
719 (1967).

Let us consider a two-dimensional Ising lattice with 2J( χ 2Jf 
lattice sites. The lattice sites at the boundary are assumed to join in such 
a way that (0, —Jf + 1) and (M, jV) are nearest neighbors. More pre-
cisely, we assume M to be a multiple of M, and take the Hamiltonian to be

where we remind the reader that without loss of generality 
and E2 
have been taken to be positive. In (2.1), cm¡n is to be interpreted as 
"m-2jr,n when m > JÍ. 
Note that our Hamiltonian as given by (2.1) is dependent on M . That 
is, we are here proposing to calculate the spin-spin correlation function 
<σο,ο"μ,λγ) with a Hamiltonian which varies with M. Strictly speaking, 
this is not the Ising model. However, the dependence on M comes from 
the boundary terms only. It is our hope that, as J(, jV -»• oo, the "bound-
ary effects" vanish, and that the correlation function we obtain agrees 
with that of the Ising model. It is inconceivable to us that such artificial 
alteration of the Hamiltonian is inherently necessary for the analysis of 
the Ising model. In other words, we believe the present difficulty with the 
boundary effects to be entirely due to imperfections in our calculational 
procedure. Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, we have not been 
able to find a simpler method. 
In order to understand this particular way of joining the boundaries, 
we evaluate the free energy for the Ising model on the basis of (2.1) and 
verify that there is no dependence on M in the limit J ( - > oo and J/~ 
oo. 
The partition function Ζ is given by

and 
A(m, -Jf 
+ 1 ; m, J f ) = A(m, J f \ m, - 
1) = 0. 
The value of det A can be found in the following way. Define the 
4M χ 4M matrices A(m, n; m', ri), where m,m' = — M~XJ¿ + 1, 
-M-^Jt

= 0, 1,..., M — 1,

Note that both sides of (2.6) are 4 χ 4 matrices. We shall order these 
4M χ 4M matrices A by the index 
/ = η - 
Ufm, 
which runs from -IM-^JÍJf 
- Jf" + 1 to 2 M ~ x J l J f - J f . Because 
of these limits, it is convenient to extend / periodically. With this con-
vention, by (2.1) A(m, n; m', ri) really depends only on / — /'; that is, 
(2.5) 
A(m, n; m', ri) = A¡ 
with 
Αι+ρ = A„ 
where Ρ = 4M " 1J¿J r. By rearrangement of the rows and columns, the 
original matrix A can be written

Note that M does not appear in (2.23). 
Having verified that the particular way of joining the boundaries does 
not affect the thermodynamic properties of the system, we turn our 
attention to the correlation <<t0,octm,n>· From the lattice site (0, 0) we 
may arrive at the lattice site (Μ, Ν) by the following sequence: (0, 0), 
(0, - 1 ) , (0, - 2 ) , . . . , (
0

)
, 
(M, JT), (M, JT - 1),..., (Μ, Ν + 1), 
(Μ, Ν). It is convenient to designate 
(0,0)L, (0, - 1 )L,..., 
(0, 
+ 2)L, (0, -jT 
+ 1 )L by φ , 
(0, - 1)Λ, (0, —2)R,...,

where (0, — V ) R is defined to be (0, J f ) R for the sake of symmetry. 
With the choice of such a sequence of lattice sites, we can follow the 
procedure of Chapter VIII to express (σ0ι0σΜιΚ)

Equation (3.28) is the desired result. However, the form as it stands is 
not symmetric under interchange of M and Ν and of yx and y2. It is 
trivial to recover this symmetry by observing that if we carry out the 
integrations over φ2 and φί the multiple integral in (3.28) is equal to the 
residue at 
a — /χ cos φι — y2 cos φ2 = 0, 
and 
a — γj cos φ3 — γ2 cos φί = 0. 
(3.29) 
From (3.29), we obtain 
y ι sin ί(φι - φ3) sin ί(φι + φ3)

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING

where φ2 and 
are related to φ± and φ3 by (3.29). To make the integral 
in (3.32) more symmetric, let us introduce the variables u and v: 
7! cosh φ1 - I + u, 
yx cosh ψ3 = I + ν, 
(3.33) 
where 
φη = ίφη, 
η = 1,2, 3,4. 
Then (3.29) gives 
γ2 cosh φ2 = ^~ 
u, 
y2 cosh φί = | - v. 
(3.34) 
With the variables u and v, (3.32) is reduced to

5. D I S C U S S I O N 
The calculations of this and the preceding chapter have been involved. 
Furthermore, they do not give us as complete information as we obtained 
for the boundary. It is, therefore, useful to conclude these two chapters3 
with a discussion of those aspects of the correlation function we have not 
computed and with a comparison with the boundary properties. 
(A) Monotonicity 
Perhaps the most elementary property which we expect the correlation 
function in Onsager's lattice to possess is that of monotonicity. More 
3. For specialists, as opposed to neophytes, we wish to make an additional 
remark. The correlation function <σ0,0σο.κ> can be expressed as 
M a + f1 dA\ <0|σ|Λ>|2(Λ/Λ0)"0(Λ), 
Jo 
where Λ are the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix [H. A. Kramers and G. H. 
Wannier, Phys. Rev. 60, 252 (1941)], Λ0 is the maximum eigenvalue, and G(A) is the 
density of eigenvalues. It has been shown by Onsager [Phys. Rev. 65, 117 (1944)] 
that, for Γ φ Tc, Λχ is less than Λ0) that is, there is a gap in the spectrum of the 
transfer matrix, and that, near Ai, G(A) ~ (Ai — A) -" 2. This inverse-square-root 
behavior, together with the fact that the right-hand side of (XI.2.43) contains a 
factor N-'12, implies that limA-Al<0|<7|A> φ 0. So far as we know, (XI.2.43) or a 
similar formula such as (4.39) is an essential ingredient in deriving this result that 
limA_Al <0|σ|Λ> does not vanish for Τ > Tc. We emphasize that, in view of the 
observation that the right-hand side of (XI.3.24) has a factor N~2 instead of N~lla, 
the nonvanishing of this limiting value is by no means obvious.

and 
<,°0.0°M,N> ^ (σ0,0σΜ + 1,ί/)· 
(5.1Ò) 
From (3.50) and (4.39) we know that these inequalities are satisfied for 
sufficiently large M2 + Ν2 if Τ Φ Tc. By an extension of the Wiener-
Hopf technique used in the asymptotic expansion of <σ0,οσο,.ν) for 
Τ > Tc and Τ < Tc, Hartwig and Fisher4 have proved the special case 
of (5.1) that, for every positive N,

However, a proof that the general case (5.1) holds for all jVand M which 
are not necessarily large does not yet exist. 
(B) Anisotropy 
Let r be the vector (Ν, M). The length of this vector is 
r = (M2 
+ 
N2)112 
and it makes an angle θ with the horizontal axis. If we consider the limit 
r 
oo with θ fixed we have seen from (4.39) and (3.50) that 
<,ao.o"M,N> ~ 7¡7? 
for T > T C 
(5.3a) 
and 
<°0.0<W ~ M2 + ^ 
e-"<<<9> 
for Τ < Tc, 
(5.3b) 
where f>(9), f<(6), i>(0), and ξ<(θ) are known functions of 6. It is 
natural to ask if there are any cases in which <σ0 0σΜ Ν) is isotropic in 
the sense that ξ(θ) is independent of Θ. However, it is easily seen from 
(3.50) and (4.39) that there are no values for Ex and E2 (other than 
Ei = E2 = 0) for which ξ>(β) and f<(0) are independent of Θ. There-
fore, not even for Ex = E2 are the correlation functions isotropic if 
Τ Φ Tc. 
The case at Τ = Tc, however, is somewhat different. Indeed, we do 
not explicitly know how <σ0 0σΜ „> behaves at Τ = Tc except when

Μ = 0, Ν = 0, or Μ = Ν. In these cases the leading term of the N-*· oo 
expansion is 
<«ο.*>*.»> ~ Aify-™, 
(5.4) 
and we find it inconceivable that (5.4) can be other than correct for all Θ. 
That being the case, this condition for "asymptotic isotropy" is that 
A(ff) is independent of Θ. From an examination of (XI.5.9) it is clear that 
A(0) and A(90°) will not be equal unless £"i = E2. When this condition 
holds we find that

Therefore 
<°O.oWN>

(5.7) 
which is identical with the leading term of (.oo.o"n,n) given by (XI.4.30). 
On the basis of this equality we conjecture that, when Τ = Te and 
Ει = E2, <σ0>0aM¡Ky is asymptotically isotropic. More precisely, we 
conjecture that Α(θ) = 2 m A for all Θ.

(5.10) 
Furthermore, for the boundary, the powers of Ν multiplying the ex-
ponentials are the same for Τ > Tc and Τ < Tc, whereas for the bulk, 
the powers of r multiplying the exponentials are different. These qualita-
tive differences between the bulk and the boundary are not understood in 
detail.

(D) Τ Near TC 
The asymptotic expansion (XI.2.43), (Xl.2.46), (XI.3.24), (XI.3.27) 
and (3.50) and (4.39) hold as Μ 2 + N 2 ->oo at fixed temperatures 
Τ φ Tc. However, from, say, (XI.2.43) and (XI.3.24) we see that, in 
order to assume that the second term of the expansion is much smaller 
than the first, we must require that 
Λ ' » | λ 3 | 
(5.11) 
or, equivalently, that 
Ν » |1 - 77r t|- 1. 
(5.12) 
More generally, we see from (3.50) and (4.39) that in order for the 
asymptotic expansion of <σ0ι0ΣΜΙΝ} for Τ Φ TC to be valid we must not 
only have (Μ2 + Ν2)112 » 1 but also 
( Μ 2 + N2)112 
» |1 - TITE\-\ 
(5.13) 
Therefore these expansions give us little information about <σ0 0σΜι„> 
when the inequality (5.13) fails to hold. 
A similar situation has already been encountered when we studied the 
boundary correlation functions. There also the asymptotic expansion 
of ©i,i(N) derived for Ν » 1 and Τ fixed and not equal to TC is valid 
only if Ν » |1 — T¡TC\However, 
for the boundary we were able to 
derive an approximation for @i,i(JV) which would connect the region 
Ν » 11 - T/TCI - 1 and Τ ~ TC with Ν » 1 and Τ = TC. To derive such 
an interpolating approximation we considered the limit where JV-> oo, 
Γ-> T„ but 
t = N(a2 - 1) = NßAE^lzu 
- zlc) + 2E2](TITC - 1)

is fixed. In this limit,

and 
(2) as 111 ^ oo, 
Λ 0 - » Μ - 1 ( 2 π | ί | ) " 1 ' · β - " 1 .

[309] 
ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION OF <σ0>0 
This expression is identical with that obtained by making the approxima-
tion Τ ~ T0 in the asymptotic expansions (VII.5.29) and (VII.6.11). 
It would be most desirable if an interpolation formula of this kind 
could be found for <σ0 0σΜ Ν} such that if 
t = (M2 + N2)W(TITC - 1) 
(5.20) 
is fixed, then for Μ 2 + N2 -»- oo,

(5.21) 
Such an f{t, θ) should have properties similar to properties (1) and (2) 
of f{t), namely, 
(Γ) /(Ο, Θ) should be that positive function of β such that, at Tc, 
("o.oCm.n} ~ /(Ο, Θ)Ι(Μ2 + TV2)1'8; from the previous chapter we have 
the explicit information that

(5.24Z>) 
These formulas are obtained by making the approximation Τ ~ Te in 
(3.50) and (4.39). We note in particular that if Ex = E2 these limiting 
forms do not depend on Θ. 
The interpolating function f{t, Θ) is closely related to the behavior of 
the magnetic susceptibility at Η = 0 near Tc. As we discussed in Chapter 
II, the magnetic susceptibility of Onsager's lattice is expressible in terms

We have been able to derive only asymptotic expansions for <σ0,ο 
so we cannot hope to use (5.25) to compute χ exactly. 
However, if we omit a fixed, finite number of terms from the sum we 
will only decrease χ by a function which is continuous at Tc. Therefore 
we see immediately that, at Tc,

This last series clearly diverges. Such a divergence when Τ = Tc is, of 
course, not unexpected. However, a knowledge of the interpolating 
function f ( t , θ) will let us compute important information about how χ 
diverges.

where we have used the value of/(0) given by (5.17). This expression for

boundary, mere knowledge of the form of the Τ ~ Tc expansion plus 
the knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of ®1Λ(Ν) 
at Τ = Tc is 
sufficient to compute χ. 
Consider now the bulk where the behavior of χ near Tc has not yet

[312] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING MODEL 
It is impossible to use this approach to obtain more exact information 
about χ than that contained in (5.30) and (5.35) without having more 
information about /(/, Θ). It is possible, however, to make numerical 
studies of χ by use of series expansions. This has been done when 
E1 = E2 for Τ < Tc by Baker6 and for Τ > Tc by Essam and Fisher.6 
They obtain 
c+ ~ 0.96272, 
c- = 0.0262 ± 0.0006. 
(5.36) 
(It is not clear from the published work how the estimate of error one" 
is obtained, and no estimate of error on c+ is given.) 
In contrast to the boundary case, where all diverging terms in χ are 
exhibited by (5.28), the divergences exhibited by (5.30) for the bulk are 
not quite the whole story. It is possible, as we did for the boundary, to 
consider the correction term to the formula 
<"o.o<W - M 2 ~ ( M í { t ; % ) W -

(5.39) 
However, if t φ 0,/i(i, θ) should not vanish. This correction term leads 
to an additional term in χ which diverges as j 1 — T¡TC\~3li. Finally, in 
addition to these two diverging terms there will be a term of 0( 1). There 
is no reason that this constant must be the same above and below Te. 
Therefore, we conclude that iî Τ > Tc

When Ei > 0 , 
E2 > 0, and Τ < Tc the magnetization M(H) 
is 
discontinuous at Η = 0. In the bulk, beyond the remark made in the 
last chapter that if Τ φ Tc, χ = ëMjdH\H=0 
is finite, we are unable to 
say much more about the behavior of M(H) 
as a function of H near 
H = 0. For the boundary magnetization ϋΚ^φ), however, the situation 
is quite different. We discovered in Sec. 5 of Chapter VI an explicit 
formula for SK^Sj). From this representation we have found for Τ < Tc 
that, though ϋΒΙ^φ) is discontinuous at ·ξ> = 0, all derivatives of 2Κι(ξ>) 
remain finite as φ

tinued from φ > 0 to © < 0 in such a way that if

continuation are considered together, the resulting two-valued function 
of § has a loop that is reminiscent of a hysteresis behavior. In this 
chapter, we investigate the physical meaning of this mathematical result 
in detail. For this purpose, we study P{5; φ), the probability that in a 
magnetic field § the average boundary spin has the value d. 
Consider an Ising model in which Λ 7 spins interact with a magnetic 
field of strength H. (In practice, J f will usually be J/" or J Í J V ) Denote 
the spin variable of the y'th site that interacts with Η by a,. Let S(x) 
denote the Kronecker delta of the discrete variable x and assume that 
σ is such that 
is an integer not larger than \ J f . Then P(à; Η), the 
probability that the average spin of those ¿V spins is a, is 
1. This chapter is based on the work of Β. M. McCoy and Τ. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 
162, 436 (1967), 174, 546 (1968).

average boundary spin will be found in the interval dà centered about 
σ. Since, in the interval — 1 < σ < 1, σ may take on Jf + 1 distinct 
values we find for large Jf 
ρ(σ, H) =iJ?P(d; 
Η). 
(1.10) 
Just as the probability function P(d; H) satisfies 
¿ P ( f f ; f f ) = l , 
(1.1 le) 
σ=

the density function ρ{σ, Η) satisfies, as Jf -»· oo,

(1.1 \b) 
We will show in detail in the next section that P(d; 0) has its maxima 
at 0 if Τ >TC 
and ±M(0 +) if Τ < Tc and that near these maxima 
P(5; 0) behaves as a Gaussian if Τ φ Tc. At Tc, χ(ξ0) will not exist and 
the Gaussian form in (1.8) breaks down. What replaces the Gaussian 
will be computed in Sec. 3 from (1.3). 
The approximation (1.8) expresses Ρ in terms of the free energy and 
not the partition function. When Τ > Tc such an approximation is quite 
accurate. However, it must be recalled that the partition function for a 
lattice of M rows and Jf columns contains more information than does 
the free energy per particle. This information becomes important if we 
wish to study in detail the behavior of the spin probability function when 
Τ < Tc and -M(0+) 
< a < M(0+). This case is studied in Sees. 4 and 5, 
where we consider the dependence of the spin probability function on : 
(1) the way in which the J( -> oo, Jf 
oo limit is attained, and (2) the 
modification caused by boundary conditions. In Sec. 4 we also study the 
behavior of the magnetization of the 7th row of the half-plane Onsager 
lattice. This proves necessary for a complete physical interpretation of 
the boundary hysteresis phenomena. 
Before applying these formulas, we find it useful to give a heuristic 
argument why the distribution p(d, 0) [which will be abbreviated ρ(σ)] 
can be approximated by a Gaussian when Τ # Tc and a is close enough

to M. For definiteness, we consider the case J f = J f J ( (H interacts 
with all spins). Define the nth moment of ρ(σ) by 
<ά»> = J r - » 2 < W • - i > * j r , 
0-12) 
where there are η a's in the product and the sum is over all lattice sites. 
If η is odd, this moment vanishes by symmetry. If η is 2 we note that in

Jl, 
and J T are all large 
<>o.ofy,k>ur.jr ~ M 2, 
(1.13) 
where M is the spontaneous magnetization. 
When ( J 2 + 
k2)112 
is of the order of J Í or J f the validity of (1.13) 
depends on the boundary condition (see Sec. 5) but is expected to be a 
general property of most lattices. In that case we have for even η 
lim <ση> = M n. 
(1.14) 
This means that ρ(σ) consists of two sharp spikes, one at each of the two 
values of the spontaneous magnetization. 
To obtain further information about the structure of these spikes, we 
define a new average < ) 1 / 2 and a new operator, 
p¡ = σ, — M, 
(1.15) 
and consider only those states which lead to <^>1/2 = 0. Loosely speak-
ing, we are averaging over the half of the states which have a spontaneous 
magnetization of + M . For this special class of states, we may systemati-
cally define the functions fm.., 
as follows:

The leading terms in (1.19) are the even moments of a Gaussian of 
width (JT _ 1 Σ/οι)112 centered at ρ = 0. To this order, the odd moments 
(1.20) are zero. Therefore, if Τ φ Tc (so Σί/oy converges) and δ is close 
enough to + Μ, p(5,0) is well approximated by a Gaussian. However, 
the important question of how close to M one must go before Gaussian 
behavior is obtained cannot be answered from this analysis. Finally, we 
may make connection with the general formula (1.8) by remarking that 
if we make a complete asymptotic evaluation of the integral in (1.8) and 
compute the moments of the resulting ρ(σ, 0) about + M, we will obtain 
exactly the expansions (1.19) and (1.20). 
2. BOUNDARY HYSTERESIS: 
A CRUDE INTERPRETATION 
The discussion of p{5) just given, which allows us to conclude that, for 
Τ < Tc, p(5) consists of two sharp spikes, may be carried over to the 
case of the boundary as well. However, for the case in which the field © 
interacts with the 2 JT spins of the boundary, 3 (φ) is known from Chapter 
VI. Therefore we may use (1.8) or, more generally, (1.3) to compute the 
boundary spin probability density ρ(σ) more explicitly. 
It is clear if Τ > Tc how to apply (1.8). However, if Τ < Tc, it is not 
obvious in general how (1.7) may be satisfied. We are not in a position 
to answer this generally, but for the boundary we can give an explicit 
answer: if 
0 < ö < a»!(0+), 
(2.1) 
then the point of steepest descent is shifted to the analytic continuation 
of SKj. That is, (1.8) is still valid provided that we note that the point of 
steepest descent is now at 
5 = 2Κϊ(έ). 
(2.2) 
Thus, for (2.1), (1.9) takes the form 
W = W(Wi) = -ß(mi 
+ 2T), 
(2.3) 
where ¡5° is the analytic continuation of g. For simplicity, we shall use 

[318] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING

(1.9), with 0 < 2»! á 1, to mean both (1.9) and (2.3). In particular, 
differentiation with respect to SDlx gives 
dWjëW,.

Thus 
W = W

at ξ» = 0, that is, 9Ki = S0l1(0+). In other words, the distribution does 
have a maximum at a = 2U1(0+). The curve W(d) is plotted in Fig. 13.1. 
Note the discontinuity of W\o) at a = 0, as given by (2.4).

When a magnetic field is present, we still define 
W(à, φ) = lim (IJf y1 In lim Ρ(σ; φ). 
(2.6) 
This is very simply related to W(a) = W(5, 0) from (1.8) as 
W(d, φ) = W(ö) + βξιά - const, 
(2.7) 
where the constant, which is independent of σ, is determined by the 
condition 
With reference to Fig. 13.1, we see that, for 
not too large, W(d, ξ>) 
has two maxima, located at dT and σ„ say, with στ > σ,. For ξ) > 0, the 
right-hand maximum at σ, is larger, whereas for φ < 0, the left-hand 
maximum at 5, is larger. For § > 0, by (2.4) and (2.7), ar is located at 
the point where 
However, as seen from Fig. 13.1, the right-hand maximum disappears 
after 5T reaches 0. For values of ip such that 5D?î(£) < 0, W{5, &) has 
only one maximum. 
A possible physical interpretation of this mathematical result is as 
follows. For a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, with Τ < Tc and 
© φ 0, the average value of the boundary spin is almost certainly close 
to SKi ; these are stable states. As § is reduced from a small positive value 
to a small negative value, this average value changes sign. Since it is 
difficult to make transition between states of these opposite values of 
average boundary spin, it takes a very long time to reach thermodynamic 
max 
W(5, ¡p) = 0.

equilibrium even after φ is made negative. For a time (short compared 
with the time needed to approach this equilibrium), the average value of 
the boundary spins for the system refuses to change sign; instead, it 
follows the position of the lesser maximum. 
This argument allows us to conclude that as § is decreased from oo 
the boundary magnetization will follow SDtif©) and its analytic continua-
tion 9Ki(§) as long as 2Rï(§) is positive (see Fig. 13.2). However, no

region where 5Wî(4?) < 0. To gain further insight into the significance 
of this region we need the more elaborate considerations of Sec. 4.

This factor 2 which eT accounts for is not computed from (1.9) but is 
required from the normalization condition (1.1 \b) and the remark that, 
for Η = 0 and Τ < Tc, ρ(σ) has two maxima. 
If Τ = Tc and Η = 0, (3.4) breaks down since χ(0) diverges at Tc. 
This divergence indicates that p(5) no longer has a Gaussian form. 
Consider first the situation on the boundary for Τ near Tc and a small.

Now consider the bulk. Here we have not been able to compute F(H)

BOUNDARY 
HYSTERESIS 
If η > 2, the sum in (3.25) converges and δ must be equal to 1. This 
proves (3.20). 
We must now understand precisely what forms (3.18) and (3.19) mean 
for a lattice of 2Jt rows and U/~ columns with Ji and Jf finite. Con-
ventionally, Tc and critical exponents like δ and η are defined only in an 
infinite lattice. Indeed, for a finite lattice, we know that all thermodynamic 
functions must be analytic because the partition function is the sum of a 
finite number of terms. However, it is clear physically that (3.19) will 
have meaning for a finite lattice if we set Τ = Tc of the bulk. If r = 
(M2 + Ν2)112 is much larger than the distance between sites but much 
smaller than the smallest lattice dimension, then (3.19) must hold with 
the same η as the exponent in the limit Ji,J/~ -> oo. If r, J( and JT go to oo 
proportionally, however, while we expect some form similar to (3.19) to 
hold, it is not necessarily the case that the η so defined will be the same 
as the η previously obtained. Even if the two η s are the same, there is 
every reason to suppose that the proportionality constant in (3.19) will 
now acquire an angular dependence which is determined by the shape of 
the lattice. A similar discussion applies to the exponent δ. 
In spite of these ambiguities, let us make the very plausible assumption 
that the δ and η which appear in (3.20) are equal to the corresponding 
values for the infinite lattice. Using the known value η = \ for the two-
dimensional Ising model, we obtain δ = 15. Furthermore, we find from 
(3.23) that for the bulk of Onsager's lattice at Τ = Tc 
ρ(σ) ~ const exp (-const J?J^\a\le). 
(3.28) 
We may slightly generalize (3.20) to the case of a ¿/-dimensional lattice 
in which the magnetic field does not interact with the entire lattice but 
only with a ^-dimensional sublattice. We find in this case 
δ = max [Idfy + d - 2)"1 - 1, 1], 
(3.29) 
where δ is defined by (3.18) and r¡ by 
<<roCTr> ~ 
(3.30) 
If we assume that this δ and η are the infinite lattice values, we find that 
for a magnetic field interacting with a row of spins in the interior of a 
two-dimensional Ising lattice the magnetization of the sites interacting 
with the field behaves as sgn (H)\H\in 
at Γ = Tc and Η near zero. This 
is to be contrasted with the —ξι In |£>| behavior of the boundary mag-
netization found in (VI.5.37). 
We may give an alternative derivation of (3.29) which is valid for an 
infinite lattice by considering the behavior of the correlation functions 
for small Η at Τ = Tc. If at Τ = Tc the correlation functions are in-
tegrable, M goes linearly to zero as H goes to zero and 8 = 1 . We 
therefore exclude this case and assume that the correlation functions are 

[324]

MODEL 
not integrable at Τ = Tc and Η = 0. However, even at Τ = Tc, when 
Η φ 0 the correlation functions approach the limiting value of M2 in 
an integrable fashion for sufficiently large separations. For values of the 
separation that are not so large, however, <<τ0σ,> is approximated by the 
nonintegrable Τ = Tc, Η = 0 value. The distance r0 which separates 
these two regions depends on Η and may be defined in two separate 
ways. We can define the correlation length exponent * by Η 
= r0 in 
such a way that the correlation function may be expanded as a function 
of rH" = const as r -> oo and H-> 0 times a power of r alone. (For the 
case of the boundary correlation function κ = 2, see (VII.8.43).) By 
studying the divergence as

where the sums are over the ^-dimensional subspace whose spins interact

( 3 · 3 2 ) 
Alternatively, we may also define r'0 = Η a s the value of the separation 
when the Τ = Tc, Η = 0 correlation function equals the limiting value 
as r -*• oo of the Τ = Tc, Η φ 0 correlation function. This gives

If we identify κ and κ' we recover (3.29). This derivation is somewhat 
superior to the previous one because it deals only with critical exponents 
of the infinite lattice. However, the assumption that κ = κ' is not a 
rigorous statement. For the two-dimensional Ising model, if 
= 2, 
(3.32) gives κ = 8/15, whereas if ^ = 1, κ = 8/7.

in Sec. 3. The integral is now to be evaluated by steepest descents, where, 
in contrast to the less accurate expression of Sçc. 2, (4.19) has two points 
of steepest descent instead of one. The integrand is analytic on the 
imaginary axis, so we may deform the path to pass slightly to the right 
of the axis. Using (4.18) we may rewrite (4.19) as the sum of two integrals,

the second term of (4.23) is smaller than 0(a\jr) 
and must be discarded. 
In (4.23), we may let J T and J ( tend to infinity in any manner we please 
and still obtain the same answer up to a factor which is independent 
of σ. 
When ö is very close to 3Ki(0+), the steepest-descents point ξχ is com-
parable in magnitude to |>0 and the previous evaluation breaks down 
because higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansions may no longer 
be ignored. For |σ| < î!K1(0+), there is still, nominally, a steepest-descents 
point on the first sheet of g but the rapid variation of 5 near this point 
makes the point unimportant for an asymptotic expansion. In this 
region, we must deform the contour of integration of the first term of 
(4.20) through the imaginary-axis branch cuts to give an integral taken 
solely on the second sheet of g plus an additional integral whose path is 
from — t o 
once on each sheet (Fig. 13.6). We may evaluate the 
integral on the second sheet and the second integral of (4.20) by steepest 
descents, where now both ξι and ξ2 (|fi| < |f 2|) satisfy (4.226). As seen

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING MODEL 
In this expression for P(â ; J(, J f ) there are two different sorts of a 
dépendance: (1) Gaussian tails of magnitude e2-rwi 
and e2jrw*, 
and (2) a 
polynomial of magnitude 2Λ/"α(0)~2-#. For different ways of taking the 
thermodynamic limit, the range of a in which one term dominates the 
other is different. In particular, if J( 
= KjV and JT -»· oo, Ρ(σ; M, 
J^) 
will be a constant for |σ| < σ0, where σ0 is determined from 
Κ In a(0) + Wi(ö0) = 0. 
(4.33) 
In the opposite limit A-*· oo, it is convenient to define 
A' = 2Jfa{0)-2-* 
= 2jV[Z¿\ 
+ z1)/(l - ζχ)]-2-*.

(4.38) 
The first term is a Gaussian centered about δ = 0 of width z2h'~112 
and 
area 1. This is to be expected because A' 
oo means that the number of 
columns is exponentially larger than the number of rows and the lattice 
for finite J ( and jV looks extremely one-dimensional. There is clearly 
only one maximum in P(ö; J(, 
in this A'-*· oo case. Therefore, a 
metastable state can surely not exist when J/~ - > oo and then Jt 
oo. 
There is a simple physical explanation for this. The factor 
[za(l + Zi)/(1 - 
zj]-2-* 
is the "boundary tension" free-energy contribution to the partition 
function found, in Sec. 4 of Chapter V, to arise when two regions of 
opposite magnetization have a boundary in common. This domain wall 
may occupy any of "LV sites on the boundary. When A' is large, the gain 

[333] 
BOUNDARY 
HYSTERESIS 
in entropy that the lattice obtains by breaking up into domains outweighs 
the loss in energy, so the lattice breaks up into many small regions of 
opposite magnetization, which means there is no spontaneous mag-
netization. 
For further interpretation of the meaning of the several pieces of 
P(5;Jlf, ¿V) we confine ourselves to the J(oo, 
A->0 limit where 
(4.32) applies and the last term vanishes. As argued in Sec. 2, if we begin 
with a state in one of the two peaks of P{5) the system will surely stay in 
that state as long as the peak exists as a separate maximum. When 
®ίι(φ) is zero, however, we can no longer determine from looking at 
P(ä;J(, JV) alone whether the magnetization will fall to 
or 
continue on SSRi(£>). To understand what happens, it is necessary to 
examine 
the magnetization in the /th row. 
We obtain a formula for 9Κ/Φ) from the formalism of Sec. 2 of 
Chapter VII. Note that

We may simplify (4.42) if we note from (VII.3.16a), (VII.3.16¿>), 
(VII.3.16/), and (VII.3.16g) that, because the integrands are all odd 
functions of θ when k = k', 
A-i(j, k ; f , k)DD = A-\j,

The question of spontaneous magnetization and hysteresis may be 
dealt with just as in Chapter VI. We see from (VII.3.16) that as § -*• 0 
all of the matrix elements are continuous except those in the first column, 
which may be written

The singularities of the integrand of (4.45) are exactly the same as 
those of (VI.5.1). Therefore, the discussion of Sec. 5 of Chapter VI 
applies. In particular, if Τ > Tc, (4.45) will vanish as £> -> 0; but if 
Τ < Tc and E1 > 0, (4.45) is discontinuous as φ -*• 0 and, following 
(VI. 5.19), has the limit

As Γ-> rc, the bracket remains finite and nonzero, so the magnetization 
in the second row goes to zero as a square root, just as 9Ri does. We 
conjecture that all SDÌ, go to zero as (1 - TjTc)112 when T-> T~ for any 
now J. We furthermore conjecture that, for E2 > 0, 9Κ,(·ξ>) monotonically 
approaches the spontaneous magnetization of the bulk. This conjecture 
has been numerically studied2 for 1 < J < 10. The results of this study 
are in complete agreement with the behavior of 9Κ/φ) indicated sche-
matically in Fig. 13.7 for T\TC = 0.9. 
Our second observation is that, because the determinant in (4.49) is 
finite for all 
the value of § c such that 
= ®ì,(4?c) is the same for 
all J. The bulk magnetization can take on only the values ±®l„ (the 
bulk magnetization of Yang studied in Chapter X), so the bulk spin must 
flip discontinuously from + to — 9JÎ„ at § = § c (see Fig. 13.7). Even 
though the magnetization in the first J rows may have passed beyond 
©JJ(£>) = 0, there are still an infinite number of rows in which the mag-
netization has not yet passed ®lj(f>) = 0. From this viewpoint, there is 
no reason to single out the passing of 9R$(§) through zero or the dis-
appearance of a secondary maximum in P(ô) as the criteria for the entire 
system to fall from 3KJ(£) to 5Βί,(φ). The analytic continuation of fflí/φ) 
will characterize the entire system as long as for each and every 3QMÍ0 
the analytic continuation is possible. For finite J, ®l/(Jp) is continuable 
not only beyond ξ) = 0 but even beyond § = ±Jpc. However, 9Koo($) 
cannot be continued beyond ±§ c because, as we have seen, the bulk 
magnetization will be discontinuous at § = ± § c. Therefore for the 
system as a whole continuation past ± 
is meaningless and in each row 
the transition from 3Λ5 to W.¡ occurs at the same value of φ. Hence we 
conclude that 3K, and its analytic continuation behave as in Fig. 13.7(e) 
and that the loop shown in Fig. 13.2 is incorrect. 
This discussion gives a natural interpretation to each of the first two 
terms of (4.23) and (4.32) taken separately. We are really observing a 
thermodynamic system which, for some values of 
has not one but 
two stable states. The fact that there are two distinct stable states is 
reflected in Pipi) by the two terms and P(o) is really the sum of two

We now turn to the question of the influence of boundary conditions 
on the boundary-spin probability functions and will see that when Τ < Tc 
these boundary conditions can drastically alter P(d) for — ®t(0+) < 
σ < sDi(0+). We study this by looking at the same half-plane lattice 
previously considered but instead of imposing cyclic boundary conditions 
by joining the J^ih and the (—V + l)th columns by bonds of energy E1 
we join them by bonds of energy — E^ 
We will compute the boundary-spin probability function Ρ,υ(σ) for 
this lattice from (1.3). For this purpose, we need an expression for the 
partition function Z(1). The evaluation of the partition function in the 
presence of a boundary magnetic field may be reduced, by exactly the 
same arguments as were used in Sec. 2 of Chapter VI, to the evaluation 
of an appropriate Pfaffian as 
Zm = ¿(2 cosh ¿ ^ ^ ( c o s h βΕ2)2^2·*~ "(cosh ß^)2^ Pf Λα„ 
(5.1) 
where Aaì is the matrix whose Pfaffian counts the lattice of Fig. 13.8(a). 
The elements of A a ) are exactly the same as those of A given in (VI.2.6)

immediately evaluate its Pfaffian. However, its Pfaffian may be evaluated 
by relating it to the Pfaffian of the cyclic matrix Ax which counts the 
weighted polygons drawn on the lattice of Fig. 13.8(6). The elements of 
Ax are the same as those of A(1) except for elements connecting sites in 
the zeroth row, where we have

(5.5) 
When χ = 1, Pf Ax = 0 because for every diagram that can be drawn 
on the lattice of Fig. 13.8(¿>) there is a complementary diagram which 
differs from the original only in using (omitting) all the bonds in the 
zeroth row which are omitted (used) in the original. This complementary 
diagram has the same magnitude as the original one but opposite sign. 
Consider all terms that may appear in the expansion of Pf Αω, that 
correspond to diagrams drawn on Fig. 13.8(a), and that differ: (1) only 
in the two ways the sites in the zeroth row may be connected together, 
and (2) by translation. If one such diagram has / bonds in the zeroth row, 
the complementary diagram has 2Jf — I bonds in the zeroth row. Let 
the value of such a diagram when it is in a position such that none of 
the / zero-row bonds are between JT and —V + 1 be d. Then the sum of 
this class of diagrams is 
2(zr 
- l)d - lid = 4{Jf - l)d. 
(5.6) 
Now consider the same diagrams drawn on the lattice of Fig. 13.8(6) 
which now contribute to Pf Ax. The sum of this same class of diagrams is 
now

If we sum (5.6) and (5.7) over all possible d we reconstitute the Pfaffians 
of Aa) and Ax respectively. From (5.7) we see that limx^! Pf Ax = 0 as

(5.23) 
Expression (5.22a) is exactly the same as the partition function above 
Tc when there is no misfit bond, with the exception of the denominator. 
This extra factor is easily interpreted as the decrease in free energy caused 
by the boundary magnetic field forcing spins on opposite sides of the 
misfit seam to point in the same direction. When Τ 
, this factor 
becomes very small, on the order of (2JÍ) _ 1. This is because very near 
Tc the correlation length is very large and the boundary magnetic field 
is able to line spins up across the seam at depths into the bulk on the 
order of 2JI. 
To show that the misfit bonds have destroyed the bimodal character 
of P(d), we consider the JÍ -*• oo limit of (5.22b) and obtain

which r(©) is analytic is cut along the imaginary axis. The second sheet 
of all of these functions may be obtained by continuing through this cut 
as we did in (4.15) and (4.18) for finite J(. If we use those expressions for 
/•c(©) and 2fc(©) in (5.24), we find that, as expected, Ζ(1)(.ξ>) does not have 
a branch cut on the imaginary axis.

the terms of 0(1) and 0(r(©)2·^) have different steepest-descents points 
and must be evaluated separately. But once this separation is made, we 
see that each separate term has a pole at ξ = 0 so that when the steepest-
descents point occurs for negative ξ we pick up an extra contribution 
from this pole. When σ is enough larger than 3Jl1(0+) that the steepest-

When JV » 1 this expression is dominated by a constant. This flatness 
of Ρα)(σ) has an obvious physical interpretation. When Jp = 0, the —E1 
bonds force the lattice to break up into two domains of opposite spin. 
One wall between these domains must be the column of — Et bonds but 
the other wall may be anywhere. Therefore, the surface magnetization is 
uniformly distributed between — SM^O*) and ®lj(0+), depending on 
where the other domain wall may be. This physical picture applies to the 
bulk as well and we expect that the bulk probability functions as well as 
Pa) are flat between — M and M. To prove this, one needs to consider 
the behavior of the correlation functions when the separation becomes 
large. For the boundary spin-spin correlation, it is straightforward to 
show from Chapter VII that for large k

An Ising Model with Random Impurities : Specific Heat 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 1 
We now turn to a most interesting practical question raised at the end 
of Chapter II, namely, how can we generalize statistical mechanics to 
deal with the experimental situation in which we do not completely know 
the interaction energy of the system, owing to the presence of impurities? 
This type of statistical mechanics is not nearly as well developed as the 
familiar statistical mechanics presented in Chapter II. We will therefore 
not even give the pretense of generality but confine ourselves very closely 
to the Ising model. In this way we hope to provide a concrete guide for 
future studies of the properties of impure and amorphous materials. 
As discussed in Chapter II, the term impurity refers not only to the 
presence of foreign material in a sample but to any physical property 
that makes lattice sites different from one another. One such property 
is a defect or vacancy in the lattice. Another is the presence in the sample 
of different isotopes; for example, nickel contains roughly 68 percent 
of Ni68, 26 percent of Ni60, 1 percent of Ni", 4 percent of Ni82, and 
1 percent of Ni64. The distribution of these impurities is governed by 
spin-independent forces which have been neglected in our discussion. 
We can distinguish at least two different situations: 
(1) As the temperature changes, the distribution of impurities may 
change; such a situation will occur, for example, near the melting point 
of a lattice. 
(2) The distribution of impurities may be independent of temperature, 
at least on the time scale of laboratory measurements; such a situation 
1. This chapter is based on the work of Β. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 
176, 631 (1968), Phy. Rev. Letters 21, 549 (1968). 

[346]

will obtain when the temperature of a lattice is well below the melting 
temperature. Impurities of this sort are said to be "frozen in," and in 
this book we will consider "frozen in" impurities exclusively. 
If these "frozen in " impurities distribute themselves through the system 
in a periodic fashion, then, though the symmetry of the lattice would be 
reduced, it would not be destroyed. With sufficient labor, such an ordered 
sort of impurity can be studied in the Ising model by means of the 
techniques we have presented. However, such an ordering of impurities 
does not usually take place. Therefore, if we want to study realistically 
the effects of impurities in magnetic systems, we have to allow the 
impurities to be distributed at random throughout the lattice. The 
regularity of the system now has been not merely reduced but totally 
destroyed. A phase transition is a cooperative phenomenon in which the 
entire system takes part. It is therefore not at all obvious that the trans-
lationally invariant Onsager lattice should possess a phase-transition 
behavior that is in any way related to such an impure system. 
The most realistic way in which we could introduce impurities into the 
Ising model would be to replace some host spins, which interact with 
themselves with interaction energies E1 and E2, by impurity spins, which 
interact with the host spins with interaction energies E[ and E'2 and with 
themselves with energies E{ and E"2. Such a model has proved to be 
intractable. Therefore, we consider the following modification of On-
sager's lattice, which may be studied analytically and still embodies the 
essential feature of destroying some of the translational symmetry of 
the system. We retain the features of Onsager's rectangular lattice to the 
extent that all horizontal interactions are the same and that the vertical 
interaction E2(j) between any site in the ;'th row and its nearest neighbor 
in the ( j + l)th row is the same no matter what column these sites are in. 
However, E2(j) is allowed to vary randomly from row to row. More 
specifically, we assume that, for j 
j', E2(j) and E2(J') are independent 
random variables with identical probability distributions P(E2) dE2. 
Let us try to describe the model in greater detail. We are considering a 
collection of Ising lattices, each of which is specified by a particular set 
of interactions {E2(j)}. We are interested in the thermodynamic limit 
where the size of these lattices becomes infinite. If, in the thermodynamic 
limit, the free energy of each lattice in our collection varied wildly from 
lattice to lattice our model would be useless. In that case the free energy 
of our random lattices would depend in detail on the arrangement of 
interactions. Fortunately, this is physically unreasonable and, indeed, 
will be seen in Sec. 2 not to be the case. In the thermodynamic limit the 
free energy per site of each lattice does approach, with probability 1, the 
same value. Therefore, with probability 1 the Curie temperatures of any 
two lattices from this collection are the same. Furthermore, we expect 
the spontaneous magnetization of any two lattices to be the same with 
probability 1, because the spontaneous magnetization, like the free energy, 

[347] 
R A N D O M I S I N G M O D E L : SPECIFIC

is an average property of the entire lattice. However, not all quantities of 
interest have distributions which are so sharply peaked. For example, the 
spin-spin correlation function of neighboring spins does depend in detail 
on the local value of the interaction energies. For such quantities one 
needs more than an average value to characterize the result of a measure-
ment made at an arbitrary position in the impure lattice. 
The complete investigation of all aspects of this random Ising model 
has not been made. In this chapter we begin the investigation by con-
sidering the free energy in the absence of a magnetic field.2 In Sec. 2 we 
will formulate the mathematical problem to be solved and find a general 
formula for the critical temperature in terms of P(E2)· In Sec. 3 we will 
derive several general properties of the integral equation found in Sec. 2. 
There is a great deal that can be said about the equations we derive because 
they depend on the arbitrary function P(E2). We wish to emphasize the 
physical consequences of random impurities. Therefore we specialize 
our treatment in Sec. 4 to a particular distribution P(E2) which has a 
narrow width (of order N ' 1 ) 3 that is particularly mathematically tract-
able. This distribution is in no way physically distinguished and our 
results are expected to be typical of a large class of narrow distributions. 
We show that, whereas the critical temperature is shifted by a temperature 
of the order of N ' 1 , the specific heat deviates appreciably (to order 1 as 
Ν ^ co) from Onsager's specific heat only for Τ — Tc ~ 0(N~2). 
We 
furthermore find that at Tc the term of order 1 in the specific heat is not 
logarithmically divergent but is an infinitely differentiable function of Τ 
though it is not analytic. Finally we conclude in Sec. 5 with a discussion 
of several of the technical aspects of the calculation and of the relation 
of this computation to the experimental situation.

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
The general theory of such random matrix products, in particular the 
existence with probability 1 of the limit of the right-hand side of (2.11), 
has been presented in a rigorous manner by Furstenberg.5 
We begin our evaluation of (2.11) by noting that 
lim J t - X \ n C A 0 ) = lim 
Τ 
(2.14) 
By means of the recursion relation (2.9) this may be rewritten as

This can be interpreted as an average over n. The only drawback is that, 
whereas the λ(η) are independent random variables, the DJCn are not at 
all independent. We now remark that, because the matrix (2.12) is real 
and acts on a two-dimensional vector space, 
= CJDn 
(2.16) 
may be thought of as the tangent of the angle which the vector 
makes with the D-axis. From (2.9) we find 
(a2 + b2)xn

axn + λ(η) 
Because the space of angular dependence of these vectors is compact, as 
η becomes large the variable xn will approach a limiting stationary dis-
tribution v(x) that is independent of the initial vector.6 This stationary 
distribution is characterized by the property that, if we apply a random 
matrix (2.12) to it and average the resulting distribution over /¿(λ) of 
(2.13), v(x) will transform into itself. Therefore v(x) satisfies the equation

We may perform the λ integration to obtain

(2.19) 
The work of Furstenberg5 guarantees that a solution to this equation 
exists and that if μ(λ) is not δ(λ — A) this solution is unique. 
Once we possess a stationary distribution v(x) we may replace the 
average over η in (2.15) by an average over λ and over x. We thus arrive

Since Cjt and Djt are the components of the same vector, their average

We may readily derive the expression for the critical temperature Tc in 
terms of P(E2) if we note that at a = 0 the matrix (2.12) is diagonal. The 
only possible stationary distributions of vectors are those with the vectors

If P(E2) = 8(E2 - El), then (2.29) reads

(2.30) 
which is the known result for Τ — Tc in the ferromagnetic Onsager lattice. 
The correctness of this criterion for locating Tc will be seen more explicitly 
in Sec. 4, where we demonstrate for a specific μ(λ) that at the Tc given by 
(2.29) the free energy Fr is not an analytic function of the temperature. 
We note that (2.29) has the property that Tc is zero if P(E2) = 
pS(E2) 
Η 
, where 0 < ρ < 1. This is to be expected for our model. A 
delta function at E2 = 0 means that in every random lattice there are, 
with probability 1, vertical bonds with zero strength a finite distance 
apart. But for our class of lattices the condition EJJ) — 0 cuts the 
lattice into two separate pieces. Therefore the term pS{E2) 
causes the 
lattice, with probability 1, to be cut up into an infinite number of strips 
of finite width, and any two-dimensional Ising lattice that is not infinite 
in both dimensions has no critical temperature. However, we also note 
that if μ(λ) is bounded near E2 = 0 and El > 0, then Tc is greater than 
zero. 
Finally we remark that the argument leading to (2.29a) does not depend 
on the fact that E2 rather than E1 is random. We therefore see by a 
similar argument that if E1 and E2 are random with the joint probability

3. I N T E G R A L EQUATION FOR v(x) 
In this section we study several general properties of the integral 
equation (2.19). The limits of (2.19) have formally been written as — oo 
to +00, but over much of this range v{x) vanishes identically. To see this, 
first consider the stationary distribution corresponding to the Onsager 
lattice where 
Μλ) = δ(λ - Ä). 
(3.1) 
The stationary angular distribution of vectors will clearly be a delta 
function at that value of χ which is unchanged by the application of the 
matrix (2.12) with λ = λ. From (2.17) we see that the values of χ which 
satisfy this eigenvector equation obey 
which is also usefully expressed as 
*o(A) - a 
(3.2« 
There are two solutions to (3.2) because the matrix (2.12) has two eigen-
values. To obtain the correct free energy we must choose that solution 
which has the larger eigenvalue. It may easily be seen from (2.12) or 
from (2.20) and (2.21) that the correct solution of (3.2) is 
*0(A) = (1/2α){α2 + b2 - Α + [(β2 + b2 - λ)2 + 4Xa2]112}, 
(3.3a) 
with 
jc^A)-1 = (l/2aA){—(a2 + b2 - A) + [(a2 + b2 - A)2 + 4Aa2]1'2}. 
(3.3b) 
If we use (3.1) and (3.3) in (2.21) we find that the free energy for Onsager's 
lattice is 
- β F a = In (2 cosh ßEt cosh βE2) 
+ ¿ Ç 
dd In [i|l + Zlcw|2{a2 + b2 + if

which agrees with (V.3.6). 

[354] 
T H E 
T W O - D I M E N S I O N A L 
I S I N G 
M O D E L 
From (3.3) we see that the eigenvector of the matrix (2.12) with the 
larger eigenvalue always lies in the range 
ex0(l) < ax < axo(0) = a2 + b2. 
Consider any vector not in this range. Pick any matrix of the form (2.12) 
with Ä not equal to 0 or 1 such that the eigenvector with the smaller 
eigenvalue does not lie in the direction of this vector. If we apply this 
matrix to the vector sufficiently many times, the resultant vector will lie 
inside (3.5). But this is true not only if all the matrices correspond to λ 
but also if the matrices correspond to λ's lying in some neighborhood of 
Ä. Therefore there is a nonzero probability that after the application of 
(2.12) a finite number of times on a given vector the resultant vector will 
lie in the range (3.5). Furthermore, it is clear from (2.17) and (3.2) that if 
xn satisfies (3.5) then * n + 1 does also. Therefore we conclude that no

region is the only region in which the kernel of

distribution of vectors that does not vanish outside the range ax0(\) < 
ax < (a2 + b2) can be stationary. 
In fact the same argument shows that, if 
μ(Χ) ξ 0 unless 
λό < λ < λ0, 
then 
ν(χ) = 0 unless αχ0(λ0) < αχ < αχ0(λ'0). 
To see what restriction (3.7) puts on the limits of integration in (2.19), 
it is convenient to plot in Fig. 14.1, for a > 0, (1) the region in the 
x-x'-plane where the kernel of (2.19) is not zero; (2) the contours along 
which μ[χ'(α2 + b2 — ax)l(x — β)] is constant; and (3) the region where 
v(x) and v(x') are different from zero. We then readily see that (2.19) 
may be more explicitly written (when a > 0) as

where x0(0) = (a2 + 62)/a. 
An important difference between the Onsager lattice and all random 
lattices may be seen from Fig. 14.1. If μ(λ) = δ(λ — A), then, as we have 
seen earlier, v(x) is given by a delta function at that value of χ that lies 
within the interval (3.5) where the curve χ' = A(x — α)/(α2 + b2 — αχ) 
intersects the line χ = χ'. This intersection is at the point ;c0(A) given by 
(3.3). There are three distinct cases: 
(a) if ί>(0)2 > A(T > Tc) then as θ -> 0 
χ0β) ~ [¿(O)2 - A ya; 
(3.10α) 
(b) if ¿(O)2 < Α(Γ < Tc) then as 0 ^ 0 
x0(X) ~ Αβ/[Α - ¿.(O)2]; 
(3.106) 
(c) if b{Ο)2 = Α(Γ = Tc) then as θ 
0 
x0(A) 
± A1'2. 
(3.10c) 
We see from (3.10) that a delta-function distribution of λ leads to a 
delta-function stationary distribution. In the limit θ ->-0, the delta-
function stationary distribution remains at a finite value of χ if Τ — Tc 
but moves to zero (or infinity) if Τ is less than (or greater than) Tc. 
Contrast this case with the case of a very narrow μ(λ). As long as a is 
sufficiently far away from zero a narrow /χ(λ) must give rise to a corre-
spondingly narrow v(jc) because the projection on the x-axis of the region 
of the χ = x' line where the kernel of (3.8) is appreciably different from 
zero is small. However, if θ gets close enough to zero and Τ is such that 
μ(λ) is different from zero in the region (however small) where λ ~ b{0)2, 
then the above-mentioned projection on the x-axis becomes enormous. 
This dramatic broadening of v(x) when Τ ~ Tc and θ ~ 0 will be 
exploited in the next section to obtain the dominant contribution to the 
specific heat for the particular narrow distribution 
μ(λ) = Νλ ¿-"λ"-1 
(3.11) 
for 0 < λ < λ0 = tanh2 βΕ%. If λ is outside this range, μ(λ) = 0. 
The foregoing discussion, however, shows that there is nothing particular 
about this form of μ(λ), and we expect that the physical properties which 

[357] 
RANDOM ISING MODEL: SPECIFIC

(3.11) leads to will be qualitatively the same for a wide class of narrow 
distributions. 
Before studying the power-law distribution (3.11) in detail, we find it 
convenient to perform some manipulations on (3.8a) which are useful 
for any μ(λ) such that μ(λ) = 0 if λ > λ0. We first note that it is possible 
to change variables so that the upper limit of (3.8a) is transformed from 
a curve and a straight line into two straight lines. To do this let

In this section we determine the dominant contribution to the specific 
heat of the lattice characterized by the power-law distribution (3.11). 
We consider only the case of large Ν and ignore all contributions to the 
specific heat which vanish as TV—> co. Then the discussion of Sec. 3 
shows that when a is away from zero v(x) is given by a narrow distribution 
which will differ but little from the v(x) of an Onsager problem. We are 
not interested in these small deviations and concentrate our attention on 
the opposite extreme, when a is close to zero. From (2.29a) we find that 
Τ = Tc if 
In [ft(0)aAo1] = In J?2(0) = - N ~ \ 
(4.1) 
When B2 is close to this value and a ~ 0, the discussion of Sec. 3 shows 
that ν(χ) is very broad. Therefore when χ is of order 1, v(x), and hence 
U(τ), may be treated as slowly varying. Furthermore, (4.1) shows that 
the region of integration of (3.28) is of the order of Ν _1. Hence to leading 
order in N ' 1 we may expand 
U(r') ~ U(r) + (τ' - r)U'(r) 
(4.2)

This approximation to Χ(η) forms the basis of all further considerations 
of this section. 
To give insight into the structure of X(r¡) we first remark that as 
N-+CO the power-law distribution (3.11) approaches δ(λ — λ0). There-
fore when Τ φ Tc and θ Φ 0 we find that the exact 
must approach 
8(x — xQ) as Ν->• oo, and hence X(r¡) must approach 8(17). Our approxi-
mation to X{rj) was derived under the assumption that Τ — Tc and θ 
were small and hence it is not obvious that (4.6) will approach 8(r¡) as 
N-*· co. To see that this is in fact the case we note that the maximum of 
ηΧ(η) is reached at 
Vm = (l/2r)[—í + (*2 + 4tu)112] 
(4.7a) 
and its width (in the sense of a steepest-descent integral) is

If Τ Φ Tc and 0 ^ 0 are fixed and Ν-> oo, í = -2(ln B2)'1

t = OiN-1), 
and u = O ^ " 1 ) so that Vm = 0(N~l) 
and u>„ = 
OiN'1). 
Therefore X(r¡) -> &(r¡ — ηη) in the sense that in evaluating the normali-
zation integral of Χ(η) we may replace X{rj) by 8(17 — ηη). 
We are interested in the contributions of order 1 to the specific heat 
when Ν is large. This is found by using our approximation for Χ(η) in 
the integral (2.20), which in terms of η is

When Τ φ Tc and θ φ 0 are fixed and TV

Therefore our approximation Χ(η) may be replaced by &(η — r¡m) for the

expected of the exact X(r¡) in this limit, so we conclude that approxima-
tion (4.6) may be used for all Τ and θ for the purpose of obtaining the 
leading-order term in the specific heat when TV-9- 00.

In fact, for our limited purpose, Χ(η) is well approximated by

not only when Τ Φ Tc and θ Φ 0 are fixed and Ν ^ co but also when a 
is of the order of N~ e and 6(0)2 — λ0 is of the order of N ' y , where

(α) γ > e; (b) γ < £ and ¿(O)2 - λ0 < 0 ;(c) γ < * and ¿(O)2 - λ0 > 0. 
We find 
(a) Vm = 0(N ""1+E), h>„ = 0(N

Since the variations in /(η) caused by deviations in η of the order of w„ 
vanish as Ν -»• oo, we conclude that in these cases for our purpose Χ(η) 
may be replaced by 8(η — ηπ). 
Because of the fact that even if Τ ~ Tc the contribution of v(x) — 
S(x — xm) to the specific heat is very small for \a\ » N~x, it is useful to 
consider the contributions of δ(χ — xm) and 
— δ(χ — xm) separately. 
It is easily seen that xm obeys

sides lead to the same specific heat to order 1 as N-+ oo. Furthermore we 
have seen that unless a2 + b2 — A0 = 0(jV _ 1) we cannot have a con-
tribution of order 1 to (4.13). Therefore axö1 = 0(ΛΓ_1) and, since 
I <

(4.14) 
To evaluate this approximately to order 1 we need to find the correct 
range of β, η, and Τ — Tc. We have previously considered the case 
α » Ν ' 1 and |b2 — λ0| » Ν ' 1 and seen via a steepest-descent integra-
tion that the contribution is negligible. In a similar fashion we may show 
that the cases (1) α is of order N'1, 
(2) a = o(N ~ x) and s = o(N) give 
only contributions of order N ' 1 to the specific heat. The only region 
that gives a contribution of order 1 to the specific heat as N-> oo is 
a = 0(N~2) and Τ — Tc — 0(N~2). 
When Τ - T c = 0(N~2) 
and a = 0(N~2), 
X(v) and S(v - Vm) do 
not cancel at all so that Fr and F, must be evaluated separately. Because 
c1 = — TF"(T) is to leading order in Ν the same as Onsager's specific heat, 
we may use (V.3.119) to find

where gd stands for the gudermannian [gd χ = tan ~ 1 sinh x], the sub-
script c means Τ = Tc, and z\c = tanh ßcE%. 
We evaluate cr by splitting the θ integration into two regions, one for 
0 < θ < 0(N~2) 
and the other for θ » N~2. 
In the second region the 
integrand of (4.14) is small. Therefore to leading order the parts of cr and 
¿Γ coming from angular integration over this second region are equal. It 
is easily seen that the large angles give a contribution to cr that is con-
stant. The point of separation between the two regions is not well defined 
but, as will shortly be verified, the precise choice of this cut off does not 
affect the temperature-dependent part of c' but only the constant. 
Therefore we may evaluate the leading contribution to cr as JV 
oo 
when Τ — Tc = 0(N~2) 
up to a constant by integrating θ only up to 
0(N~2). 
We then may determine the constant by the requirement that, 
when Τ — Tc » Ν ~ 2 , cT ~ cr, where cr is given by (4.15).

where δ is defined by (4.19) and Κ by (4.39). We note in particular that 
cr is an even function of 8. 
The specific heat (4.40) has been calculated for the random lattice 
characterized by μ(λ) given by (3.11). The corresponding probability 
density P(E2) is 
P(E2) 
= 27V(tanh Ε°2β)~™β(\ 
- tanh2 /3£2)(tanh β Ε 2 ) 2 Ν ' 1 
(4.41) 
for 0 < E2 < E°. This probability clearly depends on temperature. The 
probabilities envisioned in the original statement of the model were to be 
temperature independent. Fortunately, because the only significant devia-
tion of cT from c' occurs when Τ — 
T c = 
0(N~2), 
we see that in the 
temperature range where (4.40) is valid 
P(E2) 
= jSc(l - tanh2/3c£a)2W(tanh £2°/Sc)" 2N(tanh jSc£2)2N-1 [1 + 0(Ν~1)]. 
(4.42) 

[367] 
RANDOM ISING M O D E L : SPECIFIC 
HEAT 
Therefore P(E2) as given by (4.42) differs, when Τ — Tc = 0(N~2), from 
a temperature-independent probability by a term of 0(N ~*), which is 
negligible. 
To justify calling the temperature given by the solution of (4.1) the 
critical temperature we must show that cT as given by (4.40) is not 
analytic at δ = 0. For this purpose we integrate the integral in (4.40) by 
parts once and consider 
J > [ :

When δ - » 0 the singular behavior of this function comes from the region 
near φ = 0. Thus we may obtain the most singular behavior of (4.43) if 
we integrate only from 0 to some small upper limit e and expand for φ 
and δ near zero : 
Κ6{φ) ~ (1/2β)[(#/2)"' - (φβΥ]. 
(4.44) 
Therefore we study

Now if e < 1, J* άφΙIn φ exists so the analytic properties of (4.43) are 
the same as 
/(δ) =

(4.46) 
We have been able to replace « by 1 in (4.44) because the integrand is 
regular at φ = 1. It is easily seen that /(δ) — /(— δ) = δ, so we need 
consider only δ > 0. Then if we let 
φ = e-(li 
(4.47) 
we find9 
/(δ) = J " 
- I ) = In δ - ^(S-1), 
(4.48) 
where ψ(ζ) = Γ'(ζ)/Γ(ζ). For small δ we may use the asymptotic expan-
sion 10 for φ(8 ~x) to obtain the formal power series valid for both positive 
and negative S: 
/(S) = iS + J 
B2n~ 
(4.49) 
η = 1 
Here B2n are the Bernoulli numbers defined by (XI.4.39). Therefore the 
most singular part of cr is an infinitely differentiable function of Τ even

at Tc. However, from (XI.4.39) we see that as η

( - X)n~1B2n = 0[(2n)! (2π)-2«]. 
(4.50) 
Thus (4.49) diverges for all δ Φ 0 so cT is not an analytic function of Τ 
at Τ = Tc. It is therefore correct to call Tc as determined from (4.1) the 
critical temperature. 
Finally, it is useful to supplement these analytic considerations with a 
numerical evaluation of cr when Τ - Tc = 0(N~2). 
We present the 
results in Figs. 14.2 and 14.3. 
5. D I S C U S S I O N 
The principal result of this chapter is to exhibit an Ising model with 
random impurities where, to order 1, the specific heat is an infinitely 
differentiable function of the temperature even at Tc. This smooth 
behavior of C is in beautiful qualitative agreement with precise measure-
ments near the Curie (or Néal) temperature Tc which have been made, 
for example, on EuS, NiRbMnF3, and dysprosium aluminum garnet.11 In 
other ferromagnetic (and antiferromagnetic) materials, c appears to 
diverge at some temperature Tc if measurements are made for | Τ — Tc\ > 
10"3. However, if Tis sufficiently close to Tc, the specific heats deviate 
drastically from a diverging function (or even a function with an infinite 
first derivative at Tc) and are observed to be quite smooth at Tc. Although 
there is yet no conclusive evidence that this "smoothing out" of the 
diverging specific heat is due to random impurities and not to long-range 
forces or finite volume effects, we feel justified in proposing that random 
impurities can be the origin of these effects. In fact, the specific heat 
computed in this chapter is of the form 
Cl[Ä(8) + c2 - In w2], 
(5.1) 
where 
δ = - (1 - TITc)lw*. 
(5.2) 
If we choose cx = 4.13 J/mole deg, c2 = —1.30, and w = 2.68 χ 10~2, 
we find (Fig. 14.4) that some of these experimental data are in beautiful 
quantitative agreement with (5.1). 
On the other hand, this particular model of random impurities is 
obviously artificial. It is not realistic to assume that all vertical bonds 
E2(j) in a given row will be equal if we are allowing E2(j) to vary from 
row to row. A realistic model of random impurities should not have such

a large amount of correlation between the random bonds. For this 
reason, we are extremely fortunate that the specific heat found in Sec. 4 
is infinitely differentiable. If random impurities had increased the 
observed order of the phase transition to a higher but finite order, the 
question could very reasonably be asked whether relaxation of this very 
stringent correlation requirement would further increase the observed 
order. However, even the limited amount of randomness allowed in this 
model has made the dominant contribution to all derivatives of the 
specific heat continuous, so no further increase of the observed order is 
possible. 
We are unable to ascertain which of the results of this chapter are 
qualitatively dependent on the very special sort of randomness allowed 
in our model. For example, we find that if the impurities have a narrow 
width of order Ν _ 1, there is an effect of order 1 on the specific heat only 
when IΤ - Tc\ = 0(N~2). 
We do not know whether this order of 
magnitude persists in general. 
It must be emphasized that in this computation of the observed

(order 1) specific heat we have in no way settled the question of the order 
of the phase transition. To answer this question, which admittedly is not 
very important physically, one must study the analytic behavior of all 
contributions to cr. There are several reasons why this is not trivial. We 
mention two : 
(1) The relation of the differential equation (4.3) to the integral 
equation (3.28) must be studied in detail. The naïve procedure of using 
more terms in the Taylor series expansion of U(j) leaves one with a 
differential equation of order larger than 1 and the problem of deter-
mining the boundary conditions must be resolved. 
(2) Formally, it is possible to write down an exact iterative solution 
to the integral equation (3.28). This iterative solution is analytic only in 
the segments B2n < η < 52<n_1). The approximation employed in Sec. 4 
approximates the analytic function which this segmented solution 
approaches when n -> oo. This is the important region for the order-1 
contributions to cr, but in general the effects (if any) of the segmented 
nature of the exact solution are not understood.

An Ising Model with Random Impurities: 
Boundary Effects 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 1 
Ideally we would like to repeat for the impure Ising model of the last 
chapter all computations done for Onsager's lattice. Indeed, in this 
chapter we will parallel the development given Onsager's lattice in 
Chapters VI and VII by studying boundary effects. Also, it has been 
possible to study the nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlation functions of 
the bulk. Much further than this, however, it has proved impossible to go. 
The interesting quantities of the bulk which, for Onsager's lattice, were 
studied in Chapters X-XII remain to be computed for the impure lattice.2 
Because of this lack of computations of bulk properties, the investiga-
tion of boundary effects assumes an importance much beyond that which 
it had in Onsager's lattice. In a sense which will be shortly made precise, 
the behaviors of the boundary magnetization and spin-spin correlation 
functions are lower bounds on the behavior of the corresponding bulk 
properties. This relation between boundary and bulk properties also 
exists for Onsager's lattice but was not exploited previously because all 
quantities involved may be studied precisely in their own right. For the 
impure lattice these bounds are all2 that presently exist. 
1. This chapter is based on the work of B. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu, Phys. Rev. 
188, 982 (1969), and B. M. McCoy, Phys. Rev. 188, 1014 (1969). 
2. It should be mentioned that there does exist one additional interesting qualita-
tive result which has been proved directly for the bulk by R. B. Griffiths, Phys. Rev. 
Letters 23, 17 (1969). He considers a random Ising model in which each individual 
interaction energy is an independent random variable E with the probability 
distribution function P(E) = ρδ(Ε - E) + (1 - p)S(E). For this model Griffiths 
shows that the bulk magnetization fails to be an analytic function of the field H at 
H = 0 for a range of temperatures above that at which spontaneous magnetization 
first appears. 

[373] 
RANDOM ISING MODEL: BOUNDARY 
EFFECTS 
As in Chapters VI and VII, we consider a half-plane of Ising spins 
where the boundary row (called 1) is allowed to interact with a magnetic 
field 
We study the magnetization of this first row, 
2»ΐ(Φ) = <ffl.m>, 
and the spin-spin correlation function between two spins in the first row, 
©l,l(m> 
= <σ1,0σ1.πι>· 
The values of 50lt and @lfl are, in general, different for the different 
lattices in our collection even in the thermodynamic limit. This is in 
distinct contrast with the free energy and magnetization of the bulk, each 
of which approaches a value in the thermodynamic limit that is the same, 
with probability 1, for all lattices of our collection.3 
Even though these boundary spin correlation functions are not prob-
ability 1 objects themselves, their average values provide lower bounds 
on certain probability 1 objects of the bulk. These bounds are obtained 
by using a theorem due to Griffiths which is proved in Appendix A. 
Griffiths' Theorem. In any Ising model in which all interaction energies 
EU k) and E2(j> k) are nonnegative and in which the magnetic fields 
Huk that interact with the spins at sites (J, k) all have the same sign, the 
decrease (increase) of the strength of any Ex(J, k), E2(J, k), or \Huk\ will 
not increase (decrease) the value of any spin correlation function such as 
iai.k"f,k·') 
ΟΓ |<CTy.fc> I. 
To establish the desired inequalities we remark that, if H is a magnetic 
field which interacts with all spins, the magnetization of any lattice in our 
collection may be written 
M(H) = lim (-¡LrfOf)- 1/]? 
aj.iSjt.jr, 
je—*> 
\y.fc 
/ 
where 
—ä + 1 ^ j < M, 
- j r + ι ^ k < jr, 
and we impose cyclic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction. 
3. Several further remarks need to be made about ζσι·.η·σι.<η> in the bulk. First 
of all, it depends on /', m', I, and m separately instead of on Γ — I and m' — m 
alone. However, for most experimental applications our interest is not in <<rl i„al,m>, 
but in the average of this over all /', m', I, and m with I' — I and m' — m held fixed. 
This average is clearly equivalent to an average over E2. Furthermore, it is not 
possible to compute M a as lim,a+m2^„ <σ0ι0σ,,„> since Iimm^« <a,i0c,im> depends 
on / and limi-» <σο,·<τι,η> does not exist. Instead, we have M = ]imi2+m2_„ 
<«<'o.o<'i,in»1'a>i2. These last statements may be illustrated by considering the lattice 
in which E2(J) is given by E2(4n + 1) = £2(4n + 2) = E'2
m and £s(4n + 3) 
= E2(4n + 4) = Ε'·Γ. where η takes on all integer values. See Appendix Β of the 
paper by Β. M. McCoy and T. T. Wu of reference 1. 

[374] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
Now M(H), being an average of <σλ)£> over the entire lattice, is a prob-
ability 1 object. Hence 
M(H) =<OX.O»B2, 
(1.6) 
where the notation < }Es denotes an average over all lattices in the 
collection. Consider any lattice out of the collection of lattices specified 
by a set of energies {E2(J)} where j satisfies (1.4). The magnetic field φ 
interacts with the row j = 1 only. Therefore, Griffiths' theorem says that 
for any {E2(j)}> if Η is numerically equal to φ, 
M<&) < M(H). 
(1.7) 
We are interested in the relation between M(H) and 
3Ki(S) = <"I.O>hp, 
(1.8) 
where < ) H P means a thermal average in an Ising lattice where the rows j 
satisfy 
1 <, j < Jf 
instead of (1.4). If we replace all vertical bonds between the row j = 0 
and j = 1 in the original lattice specified by (1.4) by zero, we may apply 
Griffiths' theorem again to find 
» ι » ) ^ M{H). 
(1.9) 
But this inequality holds for every collection of bonds {£2}, so it holds 
for the average as well; so 
<2Ki(£>)>*2 < M(H). 
(1.10) 
A similar argument applied to Sm(H) = <<T0,ooro.m>butt establishes that 
<©i,i(m, ©)>E2 < <Sm{H)}Er 
(1.11) 
These lower bounds may be used to draw conclusions about the critical 
behavior of the bulk properties if we know that both the bulk and the 
boundary spontaneous magnetizations vanish at the same temperature 
as Tis increased from zero. We are not able to show this directly. How-
ever, we will see in Sec. 2 that the boundary spontaneous magnetization 
vanishes at the same temperature Tc at which the observable specific heat 
found in Chapter XIV fails to be analytic. Thus, if we could show that the 
bulk spontaneous magnetization vanishes at the temperature at which 
the observable specific heat fails to be analytic we would have 
<TO1(0+)>£2 = M(0 +) = 0

This identification of the temperature at which M(0 +) vanishes with the 
temperature at which the specific heat fails to be analytic has been 
discussed in Sec. 4 of Chapter X. No general proof of the validity of this

To relate further the boundary to the bulk and to compare the pure 
with the impure Ising model, it is useful to introduce some notation. 
It is often assumed in the study of critical phenomena that near Tc the 
singularities in the magnetization and Sm(H) may be parameterized in 
terms of "critical exponents" as

The results of our calculations of bulk properties of Onsager's lattice 
are all of this "critical exponent" form. For the boundary, on the other 
hand, it would superficially appear as if the susceptibility, which diverges 
as — 1η|Γ— Tc\, and the Τ = Tc magnetization, which behaves as 
— & In 
are not of the form (1.14). This deviation is, however, not 
serious, since we can use the relation 
->0 
lim ( i IΤ - Tc \-r - I ) = - I n | Τ - Tc\ 
(1.16) 
to interpret the logarithmic divergence of the boundary susceptibility as 
equivalent to /boundary = 0. Similarly, the behavior —ξ» In |®| is readily

interpreted as 5,,oundanr = 1. With these two remarks it is now easily seen 
that (1.15) holds for Onsager's lattice.

is that an interpretation of the "critical exponent" forms with finite 
critical exponents will not describe most of our results. In Sec. 2 we

and the subscript c means Τ = Tc. This is in conformity with (1.14a). 
However, we also find that 2Jli(£) is not an analytic function of ξ» at 
§ = 0 when Τ - Tc = 0(N'2). 
Most striking is the fact [see (2.55) and 
(2.68)] that there is a temperature range about Tc where

When Τ < Tc we need the additional restriction that |δ| is not an integer. 
For the values of 8 at which C(8) is zero or infinity the form (1.20) breaks 
down. These exceptional values are studied also in Sec. 2. In particular, 
when Τ = Tc (δ = 0), (2.76) shows that

RANDOM ISING M O D E L : BOUNDARY 
EFFECTS 
Therefore the "critical exponent" forms (1.14Z») and (1.14c) do not at all 
describe the behavior of <501ι(φ)>£2. Hence (1.15) implies that for our 
random Ising model y6ulk and 8buli do not exist. 
It is not surprising that forms (1.146) and (1.14c) are violated in our 
model because they are abstracted from calculations on Onsager's lattice 
in which the only relevant length scale is the coherence length ξ defined 
by (1.14e). In some sense our random lattice possesses two length scales, 
the coherence length ξ° of the pure Onsager lattice, which is known to be 
proportional to | Τ — Tc\~l, and some sort of length associated with the 
impurities. Because the specific heat computed in Chapter XIV deviates 
appreciably from its Onsager value only when Τ — Tc = 0(N ~2), we 
expect that this impurity length scale has the order of magnitude N2. 
In Sec. 3 we try to make these concepts more precise by studying 
<@i.i(w, 
when m = 0(N2), 
Τ - Tc = 0(N~2), 
and § = 
OiN'1). 
When 1 « m « Ν2 this average correlation function approaches its 
Onsager value. However, when m » Ν2 and Τ = Tc, (3.44) shows that 
<@i.i(w, 0)>£Ja=o ~ T W O + Zic)2JV-2(ln N~2m)-\

Therefore, the "critical exponent" forms (1.14</) and (1.14e) fail to 
describe the behavior of (<S1A(m, 0)>£2 near Tc and (1.15) implies that 
7)bulk and fbullt for Τ > Tc and Τ - Tc = 0(N~2) do not exist. 
Finally, it must be noted not only that the average values of the 
boundary spin correlation functions are of interest, but also that the 
probability distribution of these functions gives us additional insight into 
the microscopic details of the random Ising model. As presented in the 
references of footnote 1 the computation of this distribution is at the 
same time too complicated and too tentative to warrant inclusion in this 
book. We content ourselves with the remark that, when μ(λ) is given by 
(1.17), 53(3^!), the probability that SBj. takes on a certain value in the 
range </3Κι, when 9^(0 +) = 0(N_1) is, in leading order, given by

we find

(2.6) 
Similarly, we evaluate 
cofactor Coa,1D = cD(l, Jf).

Then we may write

The existence of the thermodynamic limit is equivalent to the existence 
of l i m j c ( l , Jf). This limit will, in general, be different for different 
lattices in our collection. Furthermore, C(j\ J f ) and D(j, J f ) obey the 
recursion relation

the recursion relation (2.11) to show that, for J( fixed and J( — j

sets of energies E2 in the thermodynamic limit as 
<3Ki®>*2 = z + ( l - z2)z i -

In this chapter we will confine our attention to the distribution function 
(1.17) studied in Chapter XIV. We know from (XIV.4.1) that Tc is 
located from

Throughout this chapter we will make comparisons between quantities 
computed for the random lattice and for the corresponding Onsager 
lattice with the same E1 and Tc. For this Onsager lattice E2 = E2, where 
zìe1 (I — zlc)/(l + zu) = 1. When Ν is large, usually the difference 
between Ë2 and E% is important only in locating Tc, so that to leading 
order in N'1 we will often be able to replace E2 by E%. Quantities com-
puted in this lattice will be denoted by a superscript 0. 
We will confine our attention to the temperature region considered in 
Chapter XIV, where 
δ = (Γ - Tc)N24kßc(l + l/zL)[£i(l - zu) + £2°(1 - z°2c)] 
(2.16) 
is of order 1. In addition, it is easily seen from the expression for v(x), 
(XIV.4.4), that, unless ζ = 0(iV-1), (2.14) will not be sensibly different 
from its value for the Onsager lattice. 
We therefore define

from this second region is (at least to leading order in Ν) a constant 
independent of δ and z. We find

that may be obtained from Sec. 5 of Chapter VI. For the purpose of this 
book we will not need this constant and will not compute it. However, 
it is not without interest to study the manner in which (2.24) approaches 
its Onsager limit. For example, consider the case Τ = Tc and ζ -> oo. 
We write 
z2 +φ 
We cannot neglect φ in comparison with z2 in any of these terms. When 
φ is large we may use the asymptotic expansion of Κ6{φ) given by

We proceed to analyze (2.24) in several stages. First we will determine 
the spontaneous magnetization and then will study the behavior when 
ζ ~ 0 for 8 > 0, δ < 0, and S = 0. 
(A) Spontaneous Magnetization 
The average boundary spontaneous magnetization is defined to be 
<S»i(0+)>,, = lim <»«$)>,,. 
(2.30) 
Clearly the contributions to (2.24) from values of φ greater than some 
small positive number e will vanish as ζ

differentiable at all at φ = 0 so the zero-field susceptibility will not exist. 
It remains to lift the restriction (2.41) by allowing δ to be half an odd

pendent of Ν agree either with the leading term of the Τ - > Τc limit of

of ©?,i(»z, 0) for large m given by (VII.8.42). Furthermore, this ap-
proaches its m

approach to the m

Again we see that the approach to the m-+oo limit is algebraic rather 
than exponential. 
With the orientation provided by these two special cases, we turn to 
the general case and study the most interesting limiting cases of (3.22) : 
(α) δ fixed, m -*• 0; (b) δ Φ 0 fixed, m -»• 00 ; and (c) δ = 0, m -»• 00. 
(α) δ fixed, m

In this case, we expect to make contact with Chapter VII. In particular, 
we expect that when m ~ N~ 2 the term independent of Ν should agree 
with the Τ = Tc, m -> 00 behavior of ©ï.i(m, 0) given in (VII. 8.42). We 
have previously seen in the special cases |δ| = i and |δ| = f that this is 
the case but that in the case of |δ| = f the approach to this limit is 
somewhat complicated by the presence of terms involving In m. 
To study this limit in the general case, we note11 that for large ξ

The final limiting case of <<Si,i(m, 0)>Ea to be considered is m-*· oo 
and Τ = Tc. This is the one temperature at which the "critical exponent" 
description allows a spin-spin correlation function to approach its 
limiting value in a power-law fashion as parameterized by (1.14d). In 
the bulk of the two-dimensional Ising model, η = i, whereas on the 
boundary»; = 1. However, we have justseen that, if|6| is made sufficiently

Epilogue 
We have now concluded our tour of the map of the Ising model that 
was presented in Fig. 0.1 of the Preface. In the course of this trip we have 
examined each facet of the subject in fine and complete detail. The trip 
being completed, we can now sit back and have a relaxed overview of 
the entire expedition. 
In the Preface we stated three goals of this book. We feel that the 
second and third of these goals have been met. Furthermore, throughout 
the text we have, at appropriate places, given as precise a formulation as 
we are able of unsolved problems to which we believe future attention 
should be directed. But in and of itself, this does not quite meet the first 
and most important goal of this book, because without further comment 
these problems remain buried in the text where only the most dedicated 
of readers will find them. The first goal is attained only if the current 
status and future problems of the two-dimensional Ising model are made 
easily accessible to all. Accordingly, we have listed in Tables 2-5 our 
opinions about what problems exist and where progress should be sought. 
Of course, it must be recognized that, though a description of an accom-
plished fact can be made objective, prognostications of future research 
must necessarily be subjective. Therefore, we freely admit that by their 
very existence these tables incorporate our own biased point of view. 
The first and most important bias embodied in these tables is that there 
are four of them. This represents our belief that the Ising model com-
prises at least four submodels: (1) Onsager's lattice at H = 0, (2) the 
boundary of Onsager's lattice which interacts with the magnetic field 
(3) the random lattice of Chapter XIV at H = 0, and (4) the boundary of 
this random lattice with the magnetic 
field 
Within these four cate-
gories we denote our opinions as follows :

0 = Everything is known; there is nothing more to be done.1 
1 = Something is known ; progress can certainly be made. 
2 = Something is known; progress may be hoped for. 
3 = Little or nothing is known; we do not see how progress can be made. 
In all cases where something is known about a topic, we have listed the 
appropriate chapter, section, and, when possible, equation number where 
this information may be found. For example, in connection with Table 2, 
the results concerning the asymptotic expansion of <σ0>0σΜι„> for Τ φ Tc 
are given by Eqs. (2.43), (2.46), (3.24), and (3.27) of Chapter XI and 
Eqs. (3.50) and (4.39) of Chapter XII. These constitute a complete set of 
results since they cover all possible values of M/N and all Τ φ Tc. 
Therefore the prospect of doing further research is 0. On the other hand, 
1. It must be recognized that, while the entire development in this book rests on 
the use of Pfaffians, the two-dimensional Ising model does not have to be solved this 
way. Indeed, the original approach of Onsager does not involve Pfaffians at all. 
By the phrase "nothing more to be done" we mean that there is no quantity whose 
analytic expression is unknown. Without a doubt the known results can be obtained 
by many different methods, but we feel that such an investigation, which merely 
reproduces known results, is pointless. To be of value, such a reproduction must 
either represent true simplification or result in new physical insights. In all cases 
which are marked by a " 0 " we do not believe that alternative derivations will give 
either new insights or true simplification. 

[403] 
E P I L O G U E 
in the case Τ = Tc, the results for the asymptotic expansion of <σ„ 0σΜ „>, 
given by Eqs. (4.43) and (7.2) of Chapter XI, cover only the three special 
cases Μ = 0, Ν = 0, and Μ = Ν. Thus complete information is not 
known, and we rate its prospect for future research as 1. 
We also wish to draw the reader's attention to two detailed discussions 
of unsolved problems in this book. The first of these discussions is in 
Sec. 5 of Chapter XII. There we are concerned with some conjectures 
about the asymptotic behavior of <σ0,ο"μ,ν) at the critical temperature 
Tc. Furthermore, in that section we make precise the meaning of the 
phrase " Τ near T " and show how the asymptotic expansion for Γ near 
Tc is related to the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility near Tc. 
The second discussion is to be found in Sec. 5 of Chapter XIV. There 
we point out in detail the many technical assumptions in our treatment 
of random impurities. Of these restricting assumptions we wish to re-
emphasize that our model of random impurities does not allow all bonds 
to be independent random variables. It would be most interesting to 
relax this restriction and to study a fully random model. Unfortunately, 
we do not have the slightest idea how this can be done. 
In addition to these comments on the tables, several further remarks 
need to be made about what we have not listed. 
As mentioned in the Introduction, we have confined ourselves, with 
one exception in Chapter VIII, to the square lattice. Such a restriction is 
not necessary and, as the example of the triangular lattice in Chapter 
VIII shows, the consideration of other solvable lattices is at times useful. 
On the other hand, it is our opinion that the most interesting feature of 
the other nearest-neighbor two-dimensional Ising lattices is the fact that 
they are uninteresting. The investigation of the specific heat and spon-
taneous magnetization of these lattices shows that, though Tc varies 
from lattice to lattice, the behavior of all these lattices near Tc is qualita-
tively the same. In all cases the specific heat diverges as In \ T — Tc \ and 
the bulk spontaneous magnetization vanishes as (Tc — Γ)1'8. Accordingly, 
we feel that a complete study of these lattices is a waste of time. There is 
no point in reproducing all the computations done on the square lattice 
for the triangular, hexagonal, Kagome, and other lattices unless the 
computation reveals some physical phenomenon not already exhibited 
by the square lattice. 
Conspicuously missing from the tables of future problems are : 
(1) the calculation of the free energy of the two-dimensional Ising 
model when Η φ 0, and 
(2) the calculation of the free energy of the three-dimensional Ising 
model. 
This omission is intentional. These two problems are both extremely 
difficult. Indeed, they have existed for a quarter of a century and ab-

[404] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
solutely no progress has been made.2 Of course there is no denying that it 
would be nice to have them solved exactly. However, we contend that it 
is an impediment rather than an incentive to progress to focus on these 
two problems. Instead one must critically determine what information 
one really wants from their solutions. 
For the first problem, we feel that there are only two physically sig-
nificant questions to ask. First, for Τ < Tc it is important to obtain the 
analytic properties at Η = 0 of M(H), the magnetization as a function of 
the applied magnetic field, and to determine whether or not M(H) can 
be analytically continued beyond Η — 0. If M(H) can be so continued, a 
second physical question related to hysteresis may be asked, namely, 
how far beyond Η = 0 can the analytic continuation be carried out.3 It 
may not be impossible to answer the first question without having an 
explicit closed form for M(H). However, to answer the second question 
such a closed form appears indispensable. 
Our interest in the three-dimensional Ising model is even more circum-
scribed. The importance of the two-dimensional model is due to the 
physical insight into phase transitions it provides. Unless the information 
contained in an exact solution to the three-dimensional model provides 
us with additional insight, this solution, while mathematically satisfying 
and exquisite, will be physically useless. 
With this discussion of problems to be solved, as given in Tables 2-5, 
we have fulfilled our original goals as far as we are able. How well we 
have actually attained these goals can only be judged by the reader. We 
should be most pleased if our book can in any way contribute to its own 
obsolescence by stimulating progress in this field. 
2. By no progress, we mean no progress toward an explicit solution. However, 
a few inequalities have been proved. In particular, beyond the very general property 
that 8M¡SH > 0 for all H, it has been shown by R. B. Griffiths, C. A. Hurst, and 
S. Sherman that S2M/dH2 
< 0 for Η > 0. 
3. For the solution of these problems in the simpler case where the magnetic field 
is applied to the boundary row only, see Chapter VI, in particular Sec. 5(C).

We collect in this appendix several theorems concerning certain com-
binations of thermal averages of products of a's. These results are set 
aside in an appendix because they are of a more general character than 
most of the other results in this book. In particular, the results of this 
appendix are just as valid for three as for two dimensions. For this 
reason, it is useful to change the notation and label a lattice site not by the 
double indices j and k, but just by a single index. Furthermore, the 
restriction to nearest-neighbor interactions made at the very beginning of 
the text will not be made in this appendix. Also, the magnetic interaction 
of a spin with an external magnetic field will be allowed to vary from spin 
to spin. Therefore, we consider the interaction energy 
where the sum over j and k is over all sites of the lattice. In this appendix, 
Ν will denote the total number of lattice sites, and Ν will always be kept 
finite. 
In terms of these notations, we will prove several results which have 
been noted in the text. In particular, we will show that if all Euk > 0 and 
all nonvanishing H¡ are of the same sign, then 
where < >_v indicates a thermal average in the lattice of Ν sites. An 
immediate consequence of this inequality is that

These are the results referred to in the text as Griffiths' theorem.1 
To prove these results, we first establish several elementary properties 
of spin correlation functions. Consider first the case Ht = 0. Then it is 
clear from symmetry considerations that 
W/N = ο. 
(A.7) 
More generally, the average of any product of an odd number of CT'S 
vanishes. In addition we may establish 
Theorem 1. If Hf = 0 and all EUk > 0, then the average of an even 
number of σ's is nonnegative. 
Proof. It is convenient to note that the addition of a constant SQ to the 
right-hand side of (A.l) affects the partition function only by multiplying 
it by e~es°. Such an extra factor in the partition function adds a tem-
perature-independent constant to the Helmholtz free energy but does not 
affect the average of any product of (T'S. Therefore, instead of considering 
ê we will, for convenience, consider 
defined by

To extend this result to a general value of Ν we proceed by induction.

Griffiths, J. Math. Phys. 8, 478 (1967). In particular, (A.2) is derived in this paper 
and, because it is the second theorem of the paper, it is sometimes called Griffiths' 
second inequality. The generalization of (A.4) and (A.6) to Η φ 0 and the derivation 
of (A.4) and (A.6) are given in a companion paper by R. B. Griffiths, J. Math. Phys. 
8, 484 (1967).

guarantees that 
+i ä 0 
(A. 11) 
for all j and k in every system of Ν + 1 spins which may be formed by 
adding a new spin to the old lattice. Denote the added spin by a,. There 
are two cases to consider: (1) / = j or I — k, and (2) l φ j and l φ k. 
We consider the second case first. For convenience define 
Xu.« = e - " » - ' . 
(Α. 12) 
Clearly Xm-m- is a monotonically decreasing function of Em¡m. which 
satisfies 
JTra.m, = 1 if Em,m. = 0 
(A. 13) 
and 
Xm,m. = 0 
if ¿vm< = oo. 
(A. 14) 
We connect cr, to the system of Ν spins in several stages. First consider 
σ, connected to only one other site, say σ„. Clearly Z'N+1(ajak')N + 1 is a 
linear function of XUm. Therefore, because of (A. 13) and (A. 14), it 
suffices to prove that 
2: 0 
(A. 15) 
for XUm = 1 and XUm = 0. If Xt¡m = 1, the spin a¡ does not interact at all 
with the other spins and <a/afc>JV + 1 has the value (a¡akyN which, by 
hypothesis, satisfies (A. 10). On the other hand, if XUm = 0, then Ehm = co. 
This infinite-strength interaction forces σ, to have always the same value 
as am. Therefore, in this case as well, <σ;·σ^) ν + 1 has the value <<^afcXv. 
Accordingly we conclude that if σ, is connected to the Ν spin lattice by 
one bond then (A. 11) holds. 
The same procedure allows us to prove that (A. 11) holds when cr, 
interacts with two spins. Let the second bond be to σ„,. If XUm, = 1, 
then EUm. = 0. This is the case just considered. Furthermore, if XUm· = 0, 
then El m· = oo and σ, and am, must have the same value. Thus the system 
of Ν + 1 spins reduces to a new system of Ν spins and by hypothesis 
(A.10) holds for this new system. Therefore, using the linearity of 
Z'N+i{.cjokyN + l as a function of X,,m·, we conclude that (A. 11) holds when 
σ, is connected to the rest of the spins by two bonds. This procedure may 
clearly be continued until a¡ is connected to all other spins of the system 
by bonds of arbitrary strength. Hence, we conclude that if the added spin 
σ, is such that l φ k and l φ j then (A. 11) holds. 
To complete the proof for <a¡akyN t l w e must consider case 1, where the 
added spin σ, is identical with one of the spins, say a¡, whose average is 

[408] 
A P P E N D I X A 
being computed. But the proof that in this case (A. 10) implies (A. 11) is 
exactly similar to the proof just given. Therefore we conclude generally 
that the validity of (A. 10) implies the validity of (A. 11). But we have 
already seen in (A.9) that the conditions of the theorem insure that 
(A. 10) holds for Ν = 2. Thus it follows by induction that (A.10) holds 
for all N. 
To complete the proof of Theorem 1 we must show that this same 
procedure can be carried through for any product of an even number of 
as. It is clear that the proof that the validity of (A. 10) implies the validity 
of (A.l 1) may be carried out no matter how many CT'S are in the product. 
But, furthermore, we may also use this procedure to show that a product 
containing 2η spins must be positive in a lattice of Ν = 2n spins. There-
fore we conclude that Theorem 1 holds. 
We next consider the more general case where either H, > 0 or Hj < 0 
for all j. In this case the average of an odd number of cr's does not have 
to vanish and Theorem 1 generalizes to 
Theorem 2. If Euk > 0 and H, > 0 or Ht < 0 then the thermal 
average of any even number of a s is positive and the thermal average of 
any odd number of CT'S has the same sign as do the nonvanishing H¡. 
Proof. The proof is entirely similar to the proof of Theorem 1 with 
two exceptions. First we note that when Xhm = 0 the spins σ, and om 
have the same value and act as if they are one spin which interacts with 
the magnetic field if¡ + Hn. This field is nonnegative (nonpositive) 
because H¡ and Hm are each separately nonnegative (nonpositive). 
Secondly, we note that when all Xm¡m· — 1, functions involving an even 
number of a's, like Z'N{0j0k]>N, are not zero but instead have a value, like 
= (eSH> - e-'"i){é»« 
- e-'"-), 
(A 
which is positive if either Hf > 0 or Hj < 0. Similarly, when Xm,m- = 1, 
a function involving an odd number of CT'S will have the same sign as the 
nonzero values of Hj. With these modifications, the proof of Theorem 1 
applies and will be omitted. 
We now turn to Griffiths' theorem. To give a concise proof 2 of this 
theorem we introduce some further notation. Let A, B, and C denote a 
configuration of the set of Ν spins. The spin variables a¡ are functions of 
the configuration. We make this apparent by writing Oj(A). 
The utility of these notations is that it allows us to introduce the 
concept of the product AB of configuration A with configuration B, by 
making the definition that 
σ,(ΑΒ) 
= σί{Α)σί(Β).

Therefore, we may apply Theorem 2 to conclude that if the number of 
spins in a s s is even then this last bracket is positive, whereas if the number 
of spins in aRS is odd and there is some j for which H¡ φ 0 then the sign 
of this last bracket is the same as that of Ht. Hence, Theorem 3 follows. 
The inequalities (A.3)-(A.6) follow immediately from Theorem 3. 
Therefore, we have established Griffiths' theorem, as used in Sec. 1 of 
Chapter XV.

ζ(η), it can be shown that 
A = e 1 ' ^ 1 ' 1 2 ^ 3 , 
(B.l) 
where CG is Glaisher's constant,1 defined by 
[
N - l 
"1 
2 
« I n « - i(N2 
- N+ 
i)lnN+ 
$N2 
> 
(B.2) 
Sc 1 
J 
and is known to be given approximately by 
CG ~ 1.282427130. 
(B.3) 
However, since Glaisher's constant surely is not well known we present 
here a direct method of obtaining the value of A quoted in (XI.4.29). 
We do this by expressing A as a rapidly converging infinite series involving 
transcendental constants whose values are tabulated and readily available. 
In the defining expression (XI.4.28) replace In (1 — 1/412) by its 
power-series expansion and interchange the order of summation to find 
Λ = - ϊ φ - α 2 η - 1 ) , 
(B.4) 
n = 2 ^ 
n 
where the Riemann zeta function ζ(χ) is defined as 
Í W = 
S

As í-»- oo, ζ(ί) -> 1, so it is useful to rewrite (B.4) as 
J
= 
" Σ 
¿ t « 2 " - 1) - 1] + i + ln(l - i). 
(B.6) 
n = 2 H 
" 
The values of ζ(2η — 1), though not known exactly, have been obtained 
with great accuracy.2 The first few of these zeta functions are: 
f(3) ~ 1.202,056,903, 
£(5) ~ 1.036,927,755, 
ξ(7) ~ 1.008,349,277, 
ζ(9) ~ 1.002,008,393, 
ζ(11) ~ 1.000,494,189, 
ζ(13) ~ 1.000,122,713. 
(B.7) 
Using these values in (B.6) we immediately obtain (XI.4.29). 
2. For example, the values of ζ(π) up to π = 42 are tabulated in M. Abramowitz 
and I. A. Stegun, eds., Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Dover, New York, 
1965), p. 811.
