INTRODUCTION
The origin of life approximately four billion years ago was a 
geochemical event, dependent on reactions among the Archean 
oceans, a primitive atmosphere, and rocks and minerals. This hy-
pothesis of “chemical evolution,” like any valid scientiﬁ c model, 
leads to numerous testable predictions: Life must have emerged 
as a sequence of chemical steps of increasing complexity, and 
each of these chemical steps must be subject to conﬁ rmation in 
reproducible laboratory experiments. 
This naturalistic view of life’s origin, though widely accepted 
within the scientiﬁ c community, can evoke as much public con-
troversy as any topic in science. In particular, intelligent design 
(ID) represents a highly publicized and intensely criticized 
rival hypothesis to chemical evolution (Scott 2004; Forrest and 
Gross 2004). According to supporters of the ID model, life is 
too complex to have arisen by natural chemical processes (Behe 
1996; Dembski 1999). Life requires hundreds or thousands of 
interconnected chemical reactions; consequently, ID supporters 
ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to imagine a step-wise process from simplicity 
to complexity. Indeed, according to this view, life is “irreducibly 
complex.” The logical conclusion, according to ID proponents, 
is that a supernatural designer—either an alien or God—must 
have engineered life on Earth. In this view, life arose by some 
combination of natural and supernatural events.
Most philosophers of science argue that intelligent design does 
not rise to the standards of an acceptable scientiﬁ c hypothesis, 
because it relies on supernatural processes to explain the natural 
world. This dependence on miracles not only invalidates ID as 
science, but it also represents suspect theology (Miller 1999; 
Pennock 1999; Fry 2000; Hazen 2005a, 2005b; Bertka 2006). ID 
relies on the discredited “God in the gaps” argument, by which 
one resorts to supernatural explanations if a natural phenomenon 
is seemingly too complex to understand as a lawful process.

ABSTRACT
One of the most enigmatic steps in Earth’s ancient transition from a lifeless planet to a living world 
was the process or processes by which prebiotic organic molecules were selected, concentrated, and 
organized into the essential macromolecules of life. More than a half-century of theory and experi-
ment points to the critical roles of mineral surfaces in the assembly of proteins, lipid bilayers, and 
genetic polymers. This review considers three aspects of this problem: (1) the self-assembly of lipids, 
which may be enhanced in the presence of minerals; (2) the role of minerals in polymerization of 
amino acids and nucleic acids; and (3) the selective adsorption of organic species, including chiral 
molecules, onto mineral surfaces.

Supporters of ID point to the origin of life as the quintessential 
example of irreducible complexity. Ultimately, the most powerful 
response to any God in the gaps argument is to ﬁ ll in the gaps, 
in this case by a research program that demonstrates a natural 
transition from the chemical simplicity of the Hadean Earth to 
the emergent complexity of the ﬁ rst living cell. If such biological 
complexity can be shown to arise spontaneously as the result of 
lawful, natural processes, then the central tenet of ID regarding 
life’s supposed miraculous origin is invalidated. 
The objective of this Presidential Address is to outline such 
a scenario for the origin of life on Earth based on the hypothesis 
that life’s genesis is an example of the more general natural phe-
nomenon of emergent complexity (Holland 1995, 1998; Morow-
itz 2002; Hazen 2005a). In this summary I place special emphasis 
on one of the most signiﬁ cant gaps in our present understanding 
of life’s origin—the selection, concentration, and organization of 
biomolecules into life’s essential macromolecules. In particular, 
I elaborate some of the processes by which mineral surfaces may 
have facilitated this key emergent step in the ancient transition 
from geochemistry to biochemistry. 
THE EMERGENCE OF LIFE
The origin of life on Earth can be modeled as a sequence of 
emergent steps, each of which added chemical complexity to the 
geochemical world (Hazen 2001a, 2005a). Emergent complexity 
commonly arises in systems of numerous interacting particles, or 
“agents,” as energy ﬂ ows through the system (Prigogine 1980; 
Holland 1998; Morowitz 2002). Numerous examples include 
the shapes of sand dunes and ripples (Bagnold 1941, 1988; 
Hansen et al. 2001), the formation of galactic spiral structures 
(Bertin 1980; Carlberg and Freedman 1985), and the behavior 
of myriad biological systems such as slime mold, ant colonies, 
and the conscious brain (Solé and Goodwin 2000; Camazine 
et al. 2001). The emergence of life required at least four such 
steps: (1) the emergence of biomolecules, (2) the emergence of

macromolecular systems, (3) the emergence of self-replicating 
cycles of molecules, and (4) the emergence of molecular evolu-
tion by natural selection (Hazen 2005a).
The ﬁ rst of these emergent steps, the prebiotic synthesis of 
biomolecules, is also the best understood. Since the pioneering 
synthesis studies of Stanley Miller and Harold Urey (Miller 1953, 
1955; Miller and Urey 1959; see also Wills and Bada 2000), 
facile production of organic molecules has been demonstrated 
for several plausible prebiotic environments (Chyba and Sagan 
1992; Lahav 1999; Fry 2000; Hazen 2005a). Amino acids, sugars, 
lipids, and many other biomolecules have been produced under 
conditions simulating Earth’s Archean atmosphere (Lerman 
1994a, 1994b, 1996; Ellison et al. 1999; Dobson et al. 2000; 
Tuck 2002), mid-ocean hydrothermal systems (Hennet et al. 
1992; Marshall 1994; Russell and Hall 1997; Brandes et al. 1998; 
McCollom and Simoneit 1999; Cody et al. 2000, 2001, 2004), 
and surface and shallow subsurface environments (Miller and 
Urey 1959; Oró 1960, 1961; Reid and Orgel 1967; Shapiro 1988, 
1995; Wills and Bada 2000), as well as interstellar and nebular 
environments (Bernstein et al. 1999; Ehrenfreund and Charnley 
2000; Dworkin et al. 2001). 
More problematic is the second emergent step by which 
life’s idiosyncratic subset of biomolecules was selected and then 
concentrated from the dilute, diverse suite of prebiotic molecular 
species that must have accumulated in the primitive oceans. 
Consider the problem of amino acids. More than 70 different 
amino acids have been extracted from the carbon-rich Murchison 
meteorite (Cronin and Chang 1993). This inventory, moreover, 
contains a mixture of both left- and right-handed amino acids. 
Life, by contrast, employs only 20 principal amino acids and 
these molecules occur almost exclusively in their so-called “left-
handed” forms. Life’s sugars, lipids, and polycyclic molecules 
exhibit similar molecular selectivity (Nelson and Cox 2004; 
Hazen 2005a). By what process did this molecular selection and 
concentration occur?
Mineral surfaces have long been recognized as having the 
potential to select and organize organic molecules in the path 
from geochemistry to biochemistry. In 1945 Victor Goldschmidt 
speculated: “Assemblage on corresponding crystal faces of en-
antiomorphic pairs of crystals, such as right-hand and left-hand 
quartz crystals, would provide us with a most simple and direct 
possibility of localized separate assemblage of right- and left-
hand asymmetric molecules” (Goldschmidt 1952, p.101). John 
Desmond Bernal (1951) expressed similar views in his inﬂ uential 
text, The Physical Basis of Life, wherein he advocated the special 
role of clays in life’s origins.
In the following sections, I consider three aspects of min-
eral-mediated molecular selection and organization: (1) the 
self-assembly of lipids into spherical cell-like structures called 
vesicles, the formation of which may be enhanced in the pres-
ence of minerals; (2) the role of minerals in the polymerization 
of amino acids and nucleic acids; and (3) the selective adsorption 
and concentration of organic species, including the challenging 
problem of chiral molecular selection, onto mineral surfaces.
MOLECULAR SELF-ORGANIZATION
The simplest mode of molecular selection is self-organiza-
tion, which is a phenomenon displayed most dramatically by 
amphiphilic molecules. Amphiphilic molecules possess both 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions—a situation that can lead 
to spontaneous self-organization in an aqueous environment 
(Tanford 1978; Deamer and Pashley 1989; Segré et al. 2001; 
Deamer 2003). The elongated phospholipid molecules that form 
most cell membranes provide an important example. Each of 
these molecules has two hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains at one 
end and a hydrophilic phosphate group at the other. When the 
concentration of phospholipid molecules in solution achieves 
a critical minimum value, they then self-organize into vesicles 
(Fig. 1), which are enclosed bilayer structures with only hydro-
philic regions exposed to water (Bangham et al. 1965; Deamer 
2003).
Self-organizing lipids have been identiﬁ ed and concentrated 
from a variety of plausible prebiotic sources of organic molecules 
(Hazen 2005a). In a landmark study, Deamer and Pashley (1989) 
extracted a suite of self-organizing amphiphiles from the Mur-
chison carbonaceous chondrite. They concluded: “If amphiphilic 
substances derived from meteoric infall and chemical evolution 
were available on the prebiotic earth following condensation 
of oceans, it follows that surface ﬁ lms would have been pres-
ent at air-water interfaces. ... This material would thereby be 
concentrated for self-assembly into boundary structures with 
barrier properties relevant to function as early membranes” (p. 
37). Subsequent synthesis experiments in simulated deep space 
(Dworkin et al. 2001) and hydrothermal (Hazen 2005a) environ-
ments also reveal vesicle-forming fractions. 
Similar studies of lipid self-organization by Pier Luigi 
Luisi and coworkers (Luisi 1989, 2004; Luisi and Varela 1990; 
Bachmann et al. 1992; Luisi et al. 1994) not only conﬁ rm that 
vesicles form with ease, but also demonstrate that these structures 
can grow, gradually incorporating new lipid molecules from 
solution. In some instances, these vesicles have been shown to 
be autocatalytic—that is, they act as templates that trigger the 
formation of more vesicles. 
These intriguing emergent behaviors have led Luisi to propose 
the “Lipid World” scenario for life’s origin (Luisi and Varela 
1990). In this conceptually simple model, prebiotic lipids formed 
abundantly on Earth and in space. Once in solution, these lipids 
could have self-organized into cell-like vesicles that captured a 
primitive genetic molecule—an early, simpler version of DNA 
or RNA. These experiments are prelude to efforts to make the 
ﬁ rst synthetic life-form (Bachmann et al. 1992; Szostak et al. 
2001).
Lipid self-organization proceeds spontaneously at a critical 
concentration of amphiphilic molecules, but vesicle formation 
may be affected dramatically by the presence of minerals. On 
the one hand, divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) in solution tend to 
inhibit vesicle formation (Monnard et al. 2002). This ﬁ nding has 
led to the extrapolation that life may have had to begin in fresh 
water, although experiments investigating self-assembly of the 
full range of plausible prebiotic lipids in salt water have not been 
explored adequately. On the other hand, Hanczyc et al. (2003) 
showed that addition of ﬁ ne-grained clay to a solution with a sub-
critical concentration of lipids may trigger the spontaneous for-
mation of vesicles. Subsequent work by Szostak’s group (Chen 
et al. 2004) revealed that a wide variety of powdered minerals 
promotes similar vesicle formation. Although the mechanisms

of these mineral-molecule interactions are at present unknown, 
the potential of minerals acting as nucleation sites for molecular 
organization is well established.
These varied experiments suggest that the self-organization 
of amphiphilic molecules must have been an important step in 
the origin of life—a step in which minerals may have played a 
useful, if not essential, role. However, unlike vesicle-forming 
lipids, many of the key building blocks of life, including amino 
acids, sugars, and nucleic acid bases, are highly soluble in water 
and do not spontaneously self-organize. For these molecules, 
minerals may have provided a critical template for the forma-
tion of biopolymers.
MINERAL-INDUCED POLYMERIZATION
Many of life’s essential macromolecules, including proteins 
and nucleic acids, are chain-like polymers that form from wa-
ter-soluble monomers. The production of such macromolecules 
requires two concerted steps: The correct molecules ﬁ rst must 
be concentrated and then assembled into the desired structure. 
In the case of the self-organizing lipid membranes reviewed 
above, these two tasks occur simultaneously and spontaneously; 
lipids in water separate while they self-organize into a bilayer 
structure. But other key biological macromolecules, including 
proteins, carbohydrates, and DNA, form from water-soluble 
monomeric units—amino acids, sugars, and nucleic acids, re-
spectively. Consequently, these polymers tend to break down, 
not form, in water. 
One promising way to concentrate and assemble organic 
molecules from a dilute solution is ﬁ rst to concentrate them on 
a surface. For example, scanning tunneling microscopy reveals 
that nucleic acid bases, including adenine and guanine, form 
ordered two-dimensional structures on ideally ﬂ at (001) surfaces 
of molybdenite (MoS2) and graphite (Sowerby et al. 1996, 1998a, 
1998b, 2002; Uchihashi et al. 1999).
For decades, the prevailing paradigm has been that the 
molecules of life assembled at or near the ocean-atmosphere 
interface. The surface of a calm tidal pool, or perhaps a primi-
tive slick of water-insoluble molecules, might have promoted 
such molecular assembly (Lasaga et al. 1971; Morowitz 1992). 
However, these surface environments may be exposed to the 
damaging effects of lightning storms and ultraviolet radiation, 
which tend to break down biopolymers.
For more than half a century, origin-of-life researchers have 
recognized that rocks and minerals provide attractive alterna-
tive surfaces for molecular concentration and assembly. British 
biophysicist John Desmond Bernal (1951) advocated the special 
role of clay minerals. The proclivity of clays to exhibit a surface 
electrostatic charge enhances their ability to adsorb organic 
molecules, while their tendency to occur in ﬁ ne-grained particles 
provides relatively large reactive surface areas.
Subsequent experiments have supported Bernal’s specula-
tions. Lahav et al. (1978) discovered that amino acids concentrate 
and polymerize on clay minerals to form small, protein-like 
molecules. Such reactions occur when a solution containing 
amino acids evaporates in the presence of clays—a situation 
not unlike the evaporation that might have repeatedly dried up 
shallow prebiotic ponds or tidal pools. 
More recently, James Ferris and colleagues at Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute have induced clays to act as scaffolds 
in the formation of RNA, the polymer that carries the genetic 
message enabling protein synthesis (Ferris 1993, 1999, 2005; 
Holm et al. 1993; Ferris and Ertem 1992, 1993; Ertem and Ferris 
FIGURE 1. The self-assembly of amphiphiles occurs when molecules with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions arrange themselves into 
a minimum energy conﬁ guration, such as a spherical phospholipid bilayer vesicle (left-hand drawing from Hazen 2005a, copyright 2005 Wood

Deamer).

1996, 1997). Their studies reveal that activated RNA nucleo-
tides in solution are relatively unreactive until clay minerals 
are added. Then, in a matter of hours, oligomers 10 nucleotides 
long assemble, and in two weeks, 50-nucleotide fragments are 
recovered. The ﬁ ne-grained clay particles induce polymerization, 
though the molecular-scale mechanisms of the process are not 
yet fully understood. 
In similar experiments, Salk Institute biologist Leslie Orgel 
and colleagues have employed both clay minerals and hydrox-
ylapatite to form a variety of protein-like chains of amino acids 
up to several dozen molecules long (Ferris et al. 1996; Hill et 
al. 1998; Liu and Orgel 1998). Orgel also developed a theory 
of “polymerization on the rocks,” in which he pointed out both 
the promise and problems associated with molecular assembly 
on mineral surfaces (Orgel 1998; Acevedo and Orgel 1986). 
Minerals such as clays and hydroxides are able to adsorb relevant 
biomolecules, including amino acids and nucleotides. Further-
more, once two molecules are adsorbed close to each other, they 
have a tendency to polymerize. As more molecules are added to 
a lengthening polymer, however, the strand becomes more tightly 
bound to the mineral surface. Orgel concluded that such strong 
adhesion might prove problematic in the production of useful 
biologically active macromolecules.
Jack Szostak and Harvard University colleagues, who mixed 
clays, RNA nucleotides, and lipids in a single experiment, re-
vealed one possible solution (Hanczyc et al. 2003). The clays 
not only adsorb RNA, but they also hasten the formation of 
lipid vesicles. In the process, RNA-decorated clay particles are 
incorporated into the vesicles. This spontaneous self-assembly 
of RNA-containing vesicles represents a plausible pathway to 
the emergence of a self-replicating cell-like entity.
Joseph V. Smith and coworkers (Smith 1998; Parsons et al. 
1998; Smith et al. 1999; Smith 2005) have explored an intrigu-
ing mineralogical alternative to adsorption on clays by invoking 
reactions within the channels of zeolites. The tendency of some 
hydrocarbon molecules to enter zeolite channels points to the 
kind of facile molecular selection and organization required for 
life’s origins. Smith proposed that prebiotic molecules concen-
trated inside zeolite channels; once packed with a long column 
of molecules, a zeolite mineral might have promoted additional 
reactions, including polymerization. 
The most elaborate mineral-based origins scenario, initially 
proposed by A. Graham Cairns-Smith in 1964, posits that self-
replicating clay minerals were, themselves, the ﬁ rst living enti-
ties. According to this model, aperiodic cation distributions or 
random layer stacking sequences constitute a kind of genetic 
information, analogous to the sequence of nucleotides (A, T, 
G, and C) in DNA. Cairns-Smith speculated that clay minerals 
“replicate” by cleaving. Furthermore, more favorable (i.e., stable) 
sequences evolve at the expense of less favorable sequences 
through the selective processes of growth and dissolution of 
individual particles. Ultimately, he speculated, organic mol-
ecules used clay-life as scaffolding for the evolution of modern 
biochemistry (Cairns-Smith 1968, 1977, 1982, 1985a, 1985b, 
2005; Cairns-Smith and Hartman 1986).
In spite of these varied proposals, all of the aforementioned 
experimental studies of molecular organization on mineral sur-
faces employed relatively concentrated solutions of one organic 
species. These investigations point to the ability of mineral 
surfaces to adsorb molecules and promote organic reactions, 
but they shed little light on the problems of molecular selection 
and concentration from a dilute prebiotic “soup” of numerous 
competing organic species. Accordingly, investigation of the 
selective adsorption and concentration of biomolecules on rock-
forming minerals has provided a central theme for much of my 
recent research into life’s origins.
MOLECULAR SELECTION ON MINERAL SURFACES
Prebiotic synthesis of relevant biomolecules must have been 
facile, as demonstrated by a half-century of experiments (e.g., 
Chyba and Sagan 1992; Lahav 1999; Fry 2000; Wills and Bada 
2000). Consequently, the prebiotic oceans must have evolved 
into a dilute solution of thousands of different organic molecular 
species, most of which played no role whatsoever in life’s origins. 
A central challenge in origins research, therefore, is elucidation 
of the next emergent step—efﬁ cient mechanisms for selection, 
concentration, and organization of monomers into life’s macro-
molecules (Hazen 2001b, 2005a). Accordingly, various common 
rock-forming minerals have been studied as possible templates 
for organic adsorption.
Differential molecular adsorption 
What factors inﬂ uence selective molecular adsorption from a 
complex solution onto a mineral surface? To address this ques-
tion, Churchill et al. (2004) considered the differential adsorption 
from amino acid solutions onto various mineral surfaces. Biologi-
cal amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, feature a central 
carbon atom linked to one hydrogen atom, one carboxyl group 
(COOH), one amino group (NH2), and one of twenty different 
side groups that confer corresponding differences in physical and 
chemical properties (e.g., Nelson and Cox 2004). 
We ﬁ nd that electrostatic interactions often play a dominant 
role in interactions between minerals and amino acids. The net 
charge of each mineral surface is a function of solution pH: The 
net surface charge of the mineral is zero when the solution pH 
equals the “point of zero charge,” pHpzc. At pHsolution < pHpzc, 
the net surface is positive, whereas at pHsolution > pHpzc, the net 
surface charge is negative (Parks 1965, 1984; Davis and Kent 
1990; Dzombak and Morel 1990; Eggleston and Jordon 1998). 
Similarly, amino acids are zwitterions (molecules with both 
acid and base groups), for which the net molecular charge is 
also a function of solution pH. The net molecular charge is 
zero at the “isoelectric point,” pI. At pH < pI, the net molecular 
charge is positive, whereas at pH > pI, the net molecular charge 
is negative. 
Churchill et al. (2004) immersed specimens of quartz (pHpzc 
= 2.8), calcite (pHpzc = 9.5), and albite (pHpzc = 2.6) in equimolar 
solutions (pH ~ 5, 7, and 9) of six different amino acids, includ-
ing aspartic acid (pI = 2.98), glutamic acid (pI = 3.08), glycine 
(pI = 6.06), alanine (pI = 6.11), lysine (pI = 9.74), and tyrosine 
(pI = 5.63). As expected, maximum adsorption occurred for 
mineral-molecule pairs with differing pHpzc and pI (Carter 1978; 
Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Weiner and Addadi 1997). Thus, 
of the six amino acids, aspartic acid and glutamic acid adsorb 
most strongly onto calcite, whereas lysine is the only one of these 
amino acids that adsorbs signiﬁ cantly onto quartz. 

HAZEN: MINERALS AND THE PREBIOTIC SELECTION OF BIOMOLECULES
1719
Net electrostatic charge appears to dominate the adsorption 
behavior in some mineral-molecule systems, such as quartz-
amino acids. The highly selective adsorption of lysine onto quartz 
is signiﬁ cant, for it argues against quartz playing an important 
role in the prebiotic assembly of functional peptides (which 
typically require a mix of amino acids). However, electrostatic 
interactions cannot be the only factor in molecular selection. For 
example, all six amino acids are adsorbed to a signiﬁ cant degree 
by calcite, even in the case of lysine, which has an isoelectric 
point (9.74) similar to calcite’s point of zero charge (9.5). Thus, 
calcite remains a mineral of considerable interest in studies of 
the prebiotic synthesis of catalytic polymers. 
These studies of calcite reveal that factors besides net elec-
trostatic interactions must play a signiﬁ cant role in selective 
molecular adsorption. Ideally, to elucidate these additional 
factors, it would be useful to compare pairs of molecules with 
identical electrostatic properties. Thus, we turn to the enigmatic 
problem of life’s homochirality.
Origins of biochemical homochirality 
One of life’s most distinctive biochemical signatures is its 
strong selectivity for chiral molecular species, notably L-amino 
acids and D-sugars (Pasteur 1848; Bonner 1991; Nelson and 
Cox 2004). Most physical properties of enantiomeric pairs of 
molecules, including melting and boiling points, solubility, and 
intensive thermochemical properties, are identical. Consequently, 
unlike differential selection of amino acids onto quartz, prebiotic 
chiral molecular selection cannot be ascribed to net-charge ef-
fects. Instead, a conﬁ rmation-speciﬁ c chiral environment must 
be invoked to explain any separation of left-handed from right-
handed molecules. 
Prebiotic synthesis processes generally yield equal amounts 
of L- and D-enantiomers (Lahav 1999; Mason 2000; Hazen 
2005a). Thus, researchers have invoked two broad categories 
of symmetry-breaking phenomena to explain life’s chiral excess 
(Bonner 1991, 1992, 1995; Pályi et al. 1999). Some authors 
claim that an important philosophical distinction exists between 
deterministic models of life’s chirality (i.e., that some intrinsic 
feature of the universe inevitably leads to preferential selection 
of left-handed amino acids) vs. a chance local selection of left 
or right (i.e., life might have formed either way through local 
stochastic processes). Note, however, that of the many symme-
try-breaking models proposed, parity violations (so-called “CP 
violations”) in beta decay provide the only known universal chiral 
inﬂ uence. Most authors conclude that this effect is so small as 
to be negligible in any realistic calculations of chiral selection 
(Bonner 1991, 1995). 
All other proposed symmetry-breaking mechanisms are local, 
though at vastly different scales (i.e., Popa 1997). Some workers 
have favored nebular-scale processes such as chiral-selective 
photolysis by circular-polarized synchrotron radiation from neu-
tron stars (Bailey et al. 1998; Clark 1999; Podlech 1999) or mag-
netochiral photochemistry (Rikken and Raupach 2000). These 
processes are consistent with the small but signiﬁ cant excess 
of L-amino acids reported from some carbonaceous chondrite 
meteorites (Engel and Macko 1997; Cronin and Pizzarello 1997; 
Pizzarello and Cronin 2000; Glavin and Dworkin 2006).
Other workers have focused on local “asymmetric agents” 
(Avetisov et al. 1991; Popa 1997; Avetisov 1999). Some proposed 
mechanisms rely on local ampliﬁ cation of slight chiral excesses, 
for example by Bose-Einstein condensation (Chela-Flores 
1994), or by chiral self-assembly of polymers (Bolli et al. 1997; 
Lippmann and Dix 1999; Saghatelian et al. 2001) or crystals 
(Eckert et al. 1993; Lahav and Leiserowitz 1999). However, the 
simpler, geochemically relevant chiral selection mechanism of 
adsorption on chiral mineral surfaces has been overlooked in 
large part (Lahav 1999; Jacoby 2002; Hazen and Sholl 2003).
Chiral mineral surfaces abound in the natural world. Quartz 
is the only common chiral rock-forming mineral (i.e., it occurs 
naturally in both left- and right-handed crystals), but all centric 
crystals also have the potential to display chiral fracture or 
growth surfaces (Hazen 2004; Downs and Hazen 2004), as well 
as chiral surface features such as steps and kink sites (Orme et al. 
2001; Hazen and Sholl 2003; De Yoreo and Dove 2004). Com-
mon intrinsically chiral surfaces, in addition to those of quartz, 
include feldspar (110), clinopyroxene (110) and (111), olivine 
(111), clinoamphibole (110) and (011), calcite (214), and gypsum 
(110) and (111) faces. Thus, selection and adsorption of organic 
molecules on mineral surfaces represents a viable mechanism 
for prebiotic molecular symmetry breaking.
It must be emphasized that left- and right-handed mineral 
surfaces are present on Earth in roughly equal abundance (e.g., 
Frondel 1978; Evgenii and Wolfram 2000), so it is natural to ask 
how a chiral bias in biochemical systems could arise. Advocates 
of mineral-induced handedness suggest that life’s origin was a 
local molecular event, not dictated by global averages. A single 
successful self-replicating chiral synthesis, which assembled by 
chance on a left- or a right-handed crystal face, could dictate the 
dominant subsequent biochemical overprint in spite of initially 
racemic mixtures of both molecules and surfaces. 
Minerals provide Earth’s most chirally biased environments, 
and thus may represent the most likely loci for prebiotic chiral 
selection and ampliﬁ cation (Downs and Hazen 2004). Indeed, 
according to Lahav (1999), symmetry breaking by chiral surfaces 
offers a viable scenario for life’s origin: “If a selective adsorption 
of chiral amino acids ... on certain crystal faces were observed, 
then the problem of biological homochirality would be possible 
to comprehend” (p. 259). In addition, synthesis and puriﬁ cation 
of chiral pharmaceuticals represents an industry with annual 
domestic sales approaching $200 billion (Rouhi 2004). Given 
this importance to science and industry (e.g., Pályi et al. 1999; 
Jacoby 2002), new approaches to the selection and organization 
of chiral molecules warrant further study.
Chiral molecular selection by a crystal requires three, non-
colinear interaction points between the molecule and mineral 
surface (e.g., Booth et al. 1996; Davankov 1997). Previous stud-
ies of adsorption of organic molecules on mineral surfaces have 
focused on symmetry-breaking effects of powdered right- vs. 
left-handed quartz, which is the most common acentric mineral 
(Bonner 1995; Soai et al. 1999). But, as noted above, all centric 
minerals also have the potential for symmetry breaking (McFad-
den et al. 1996; Sholl 1998; Lahav 1999; Attard 2001; Hazen et 
al 2001, 2003; Hazen and Sholl 2003; Hazen 2004; Downs and 
Hazen 2004). Indeed, any general crystal face with a surface 
structure lacking a mirror or glide plane symmetry operator has 
the potential for chiral selectivity. This untapped potential for chi-

ral selectivity by common growth faces of rock-forming minerals 
represents a promising opportunity for further research.
Of fundamental importance to these chirality studies are 
measurements of interactions that occur on speciﬁ c crystal faces, 
as opposed to bulk measurements on polycrystalline samples. 
Many aspects of mineral surfaces, including atomic structure 
(Hazen 2004; Downs and Hazen 2004), topographic features 
such as steps, kink sites, and etch pits (Joshi et al. 1970; Joshi 
and Paul 1977; Teng et al. 1998 and work in preparation; Orme 
et al. 2001; De Yoreo and Dove 2004), and electrochemical 
properties such as surface potential (Parsons 1990; Churchill 
et al. 2004), vary among the different crystallographic faces of 
a given crystal. Characterizations of these and other properties 
must be conducted on speciﬁ c crystal faces if they are to be 
relevant to understanding stereoselective adsorption.
Consider chiral molecular selection on quartz (Tsuchida et al. 
1935; Karagounis and Coumoulos 1938; Amariglio et al. 1968; 
Bonner et al. 1974, 1975; Soai et al. 1999). All of these studies 
employed powdered quartz crystals—a procedure that increases 
the reactive surface area but limits the possibility of determining the 
magnitude or identifying structural mechanisms of adsorption on 
speciﬁ c surfaces. Different crystal growth faces of quartz display 
dramatically different adsorption characteristics, for example, in the 
differential formation of Fe-oxide coatings on the two symmetrically 
distinct rhombohedral faces, (10–11) and (01–11) (Fig. 2). The only 
effective way to study chiral adsorption, therefore, is to examine 
well-developed chiral growth faces on single crystals.
Accordingly, Hazen et al. (2001, 2003) demonstrated selec-
tive adsorption of D- and L- amino acids on calcite scalenohedral 
{214}-type crystal faces, which are chiral. Calcite was chosen 
for several reasons that underscore the desirability of studying 
geochemically plausible origin scenarios: (1) calcite and other 
rhombohedral carbonate minerals were abundant in the Archean 
Era (e.g., Balley and Palmer 1989; Sumner 1997). (2) Calcite 
strongly adsorbs amino acids (Carter and Mitterer 1978; Low-
enstam and Weiner 1989; Weiner and Addadi 1997; Alzenberg et 
al. 2001). (3) Calcite’s surface growth topology is dramatically 
affected by adsorbed L- vs. D-amino acids (Teng and Dove 
1997; Teng et al. 1998, 2000, and work in preparation; Orme 
et al. 2001; De Yoreo and Dove 2004). And (4) calcite’s com-
mon {214}-type scalenohedral crystal forms (Dana 1958), for 
example (214) and (3–14), have the potential for chiral selectivity 
(Fig. 3). [Note that all calcite Miller indices are here reported 
in terms of the hexagonal “structural unit cell” (a = 5 Å; c = 17 
Å), which is the minimal unit cell determined by X-ray methods. 
These indices should not be confused with those of the hexago-
nal “morphological unit cell” (a = 10 Å; c = 8.5 Å), which has 
traditionally been used to describe calcite twinning, cleavage, 
and crystal forms (Dana 1958; Deer et al. 1971), or with either 
of two rhombohedral unit cells that further complicate the issue. 
Thus, for example, Miller indices for the cleavage face are (101) 
in the hexagonal morphological setting, but (104) in the preferred 
hexagonal structural setting.] 
As a test of chiral selective adsorption, Hazen et al. (2001) 
immersed a calcite crystal in a racemic solution of aspartic 
acid. The crystal was rinsed in HPLC-grade water to remove 
excess amino acids, and any adsorbed amino acids from each 
individual face were then removed with HCl. Analyses of these 
acid washes demonstrated that “right-handed” (214)-type faces 
selectively adsorb D-aspartic acid, whereas enantiomeric (i.e., 
mirror-related) “left-handed” (3–14)-type faces selectively adsorb 
L-aspartic acid. However, similar experiments on calcite im-
mersed in DL-alanine show no chiral selectivity (Hazen et al. 
2003). These studies of calcite-amino acid interactions, which 
provide the ﬁ rst experimental demonstration of signiﬁ cant chiral 
molecular selectivity on growth surfaces of a centric mineral, 
point to the need for additional experiments. 
Theoretical modeling of mineral-molecule chiral interactions
Theory provides an essential complement to experimental 
studies of mineral-molecule interactions. Integration of experi-

ments and theoretical molecular methods has been carried out for 
(1) amino acids and carboxylic acids on metal and metal-oxide 
surfaces (Barbosa and Sautet 2001; Chen et al. 2002; Langel 
and Menken 2003; Toomes et al. 2003; Efstathiou and Woodruff 
2003; Barlow and Raval 2003; Jones and Baddeley 2004); (2) 
anions adsorbed on oxide surfaces (Brown et al. 1998; Collins et 
al. 1999; Kubicki et al. 1999; Kwon and Kubicki 2004; Peacock 
and Sherman 2004; Yoon et al. 2004; Bargar et al. 2005; Pers-
son and Axe 2005); and (3) aspartic acid on calcite (Orme et al. 
2001; Kwon and Kubicki 2003). In addition, for the calcite-water 
interface, many theoretical simulations and observations exist 
to guide surface chemical models (Stipp and Hochella 1991; 
Van Cappellen et al. 1993; Hochella 1995; Vaughan 1995; de 
Leeuw and Parker 1997; Teng et al. 1998, 2000; de Leeuw et al. 
1999; Fenter et al. 2000; Wright et al. 2001; Cygan et al. 2002; 
Stipp 2002; de Leeuw and Cooper 2004; Geissbuhler et al. 2004; 
Kristensen et al. 2004). 
In the last decade, several authors have applied computational 
techniques to investigate chiral surfaces for their potential use 
in enantioselective synthesis and puriﬁ cation of chiral pharma-
ceuticals. The majority of these investigations have focused on 
chiral metal surfaces, which can be obtained by cutting a metal 
crystal along planes with high Miller indices and subsequent an-
nealing (Sholl et al. 2001; Horvath and Gellman 2001; Asthagiri 
et al. 2002). This process yields surfaces with numerous steps 
and chiral kink sites, which act as the loci for chiral selection. 
Adsorption of chiral organic molecules on various chiral metal 
surfaces thus has been examined both experimentally and theo-
retically (McFadden et al. 1996; Sholl 1998; Ahmadi et al. 1999; 
Power and Sholl 1999; Attard 2001; Attard et al. 2002; Chen et 
al. 2002; Sljivancanin et al. 2002; Efstathiou and Woodruff 2003; 
Rankin and Sholl 2004). Temperature programmed desorption 
(TPD) studies of various chiral molecules on the chiral copper 
(643) surface have detected enantiospeciﬁ c binding energies 
ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 kcal/mol (Horvath and Gellman 2001, 
2002). Similar enantiospeciﬁ c binding energies have been found 
in theoretical studies of physisorption of small chiral molecules 
on chiral surfaces of platinum and gold (Sholl 1998; Sljivancanin 
et al. 2002). An important conclusion of these studies is conﬁ r-
mation that an enantiospeciﬁ c effect requires three non-colinear 
strong points of interaction with the chiral surface. Molecules 
with only two such interactions, by contrast, do not show sig-
niﬁ cant chiral selectivity. 
Theoretical modeling of mineral-molecule interactions, 
though computationally more intensive than metal-molecule or 
metal-water calculations, also provides an important comple-
ment to experiments. We wish to understand structural details 
of chiral bonded interactions between calcite and amino acids. 
For example, by what mechanism do right- and left-handed 
calcite {214}-type surfaces preferentially select D- or L-amino 
acids? Speciﬁ cally, why are D- and L-aspartic acid more easily 
separated than D- and L-alanine? The chiral selection of aspartic 
acid on {214}-type faces implies a three-point interaction, in con-
trast to the non-chiral binding of alanine to calcite. What are the 
points of interaction? Accordingly, we have attempted to model 
the conﬁ guration of these mineral-molecule pairs using density 
functional theory (DFT) computational methods (Asthagiri et al. 
2004; Asthagiri and Hazen 2004, and work in preparation).
As a ﬁ rst simplifying step, we have examined only the amino 
acid and the idealized ﬂ at mineral surface; water molecules are 
not included in our calculations. We thus assume that a direct and 
strong interaction exists between the amino acid and the mineral 
surface—an assumption supported by the presence of amino 
acids on calcite surfaces after vigorous washing treatments. In 
our experiments, we were able to recover adsorbed amino acids 
only after dissolution of the calcite surface by HCl. The ﬁ nal state 
of the mineral-molecule system certainly will be inﬂ uenced by 
the aqueous system and its pH. Nevertheless, comparison of the 
relative binding energies and conﬁ gurations of D- vs. L-amino 
acids on a given calcite surface provide insights regarding the 
structural basis for selective adsorption.
With optimized models of alanine and the calcite (214) 
surface, Asthagiri and Hazen (2004, and work in preparation) 
searched for minimum energy adsorption conﬁ gurations (sepa-
rately for D- and L-amino acids). Chiral selective adsorption 
is a function of the difference in energies of the two enantio-
meric systems. We identiﬁ ed numerous local minima for both 
enantiomers of alanine on calcite (214) but found that the most 
stable minima for D- and L-alanine have negligible differences 
in adsorption energy (Fig. 4). Analyses revealed that there are 
only two strong interactions for alanine on calcite, as opposed to 
the three points required to obtain a chiral effect. The strongest 
interaction in the adsorbed system is between a Ca atom of the 
calcite surface and the O atom of alanine’s carboxyl (COOH) 
group, while a secondary interaction occurs between a calcite 
surface O atom and a hydrogen of NH2 (alanine’s amino group). 
We conclude that the observed weak enantiospeciﬁ city results 
from the relative differences in dimensions of the alanine and 
the atoms on the calcite (214) surface: surface O and Ca atoms 
on calcite (214) are separated by 6 Å, whereas the separation of 
alanine NH2 and COOH groups is roughly 4 Å. This dimensional 
disparity prevents the alanine molecule from forming three 
strong points of contact with the calcite surface, a prerequisite 
for strong enantiospeciﬁ city.
By contrast, we calculated a large enantiospeciﬁ c effect for 
aspartic acid on the calcite (214) surface (Fig. 5), based on the 
formation of three strong mineral-molecule interactions. Aspar-
tic acid features two carboxyl groups with an O-O separation 
similar to that of the calcite surface Ca-Ca separation. The two 
resultant Ca-O bonds between calcite and aspartic acid ﬁ x the 
orientation of the molecule on the mineral surface. In the case 
of D-asparatic acid, a third O-H bond readily forms between a 
calcite (214) surface oxygen and aspartic acid’s amino group as a 
consequence of a fortuitously matching conﬁ guration. However, 
no such match is found for L-aspartic acid, which cannot form a 
third strong bond with the calcite (214) surface. Consequently, 
D-aspartic acid bonds preferentially to L-aspartic acid on calcite 
(214) surfaces by approximately 8 kcal/mol—the largest known 
chiral selective energy. This result is consistent with the experi-
mental data of Hazen et al. (2001, 2003) and Orme et al. (2001) 
and shows the promise of using computational techniques to gain 
a better understanding of mineral-molecule interactions.
The real world 
Real crystal surfaces are seldom ﬂ at. In the case of close-
packed metal surfaces, including Pt, Ag, Au, and Cu, ideally

O of the carboxyl group of alanine, and O from calcite bonds to the amino group from alanine. Calculations of Asthagiri et al. (2004) indicate that 
these two conﬁ gurations have similar energies, consistent with experimental observations of no chiral selectivity (Hazen et al. 2003). The Ca, C, 
and O atoms of calcite are green, gray, and red, respectively; the C, N, O, and H atoms of alanine are gray, blue, orange, and white, respectively 
(from Asthagiri et al. 2004).

of the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid, and O from calcite bonds to the amino group from aspartic acid. L-aspartic acid (right) forms only two 
strong bonds with this surface. Calculations of Asthagiri et al. (2004) indicate an enantiospeciﬁ c energy of ~8 kcal/mol, consistent with experimental 
observations of chiral selectivity (Hazen et al. 2001). The Ca, C, and O atoms of calcite are green, gray, and red, respectively; the C, N, O, and H 
atoms of aspartic acid are gray, blue, orange, and white, respectively (from Asthagiri et al. 2004).
ﬂ at terraces can only exist for (100), (110), and (111). All other 
close-packed metal surfaces must incorporate steps and kinks. 
Chiral kink sites are thus intrinsic to all high-index surfaces and 
they dictate molecular adsorption behavior on these faces (Mc-
Fadden et al. 1996; Sholl 1998; Power and Sholl 1999; Ahmadi 
et al. 1999; Gellman et al. 2001). 
Mineral surfaces, with their lower symmetries and multiple 
crystallographically distinct atomic sites, present additional com-
plexities compared to metals. Although some common surfaces 
of rock-forming minerals can, in principle, be ideally planar at 
the atomic scale [e.g., quartz (100), graphite (001), and layer 
silicate (001)], most idealized surfaces are intrinsically irregular, 
such as the ~2 Å relief on the calcite (214) surface (Hazen 2004). 
Mineral surfaces also commonly incorporate growth defects, 
including step edges and kink sites, which provide promising 
docking loci for organic molecules (Orme et al. 2001; Hazen 

HAZEN: MINERALS AND THE PREBIOTIC SELECTION OF BIOMOLECULES

and Sholl 2003; De Yoreo and 
Dove 2004; see Fig. 6). 
Of special note are the inves-
tigations of Dove and coworkers 
(Teng and Dove 1997; Teng et al. 
1998, 2000; Orme et al. 2001; De 
Yoreo and Dove 2004; Elrahj et 
al. 2006), who have documented 
signiﬁ cant interactions between 
organic molecular species and 
calcite surface irregularities. 
Such interactions are strikingly 
revealed during crystal growth 
or dissolution in the presence of 
organic molecules, for example, 
of chiral amino acids. Asymmet-
ric spiral growth edges and etch 
pits on the calcite (104) cleavage 
surface reveal that molecules 
preferentially dock along crys-
tallographically distinct edges 
and kinks. Such binding may 
inhibit crystal growth in certain 
directions and thus result in un-
usual crystal morphologies (e.g., 
Cody and Cody 1991). 
Mineral-molecule interac-
tions may be highly specific 
to individual step edges, kink 
sites, and other irregularities. 
Teng et al. (in preparation), for 
example, observed that etch-pit 
morphologies on calcite (104) 
differ dramatically in the pres-
ence of different amino acids 
and carboxylic acids. Elhadj et 
al. (2006), furthermore, found 
FIGURE 6. Crystals may incorporate three types of chiral surface features: (a) An idealized terrace, represented as a periodic two-dimensional 
chiral arrangement of atoms in a plane; these atoms may be coplanar or they may occur at slightly different heights. (b) A terrace step that is chiral 
along a step edge (red line). (c) A kink site that provides a chiral center (X). Experimental and theoretical studies (Sholl 1998; Orme et al. 2001; 
Hazen and Sholl 2003; De Yoreo and Dove 2004) reveal that molecular adsorption is enhanced at surface irregularities.

through experiments and modeling that polyaspartate (short 
peptide chains of aspartic acid molecules) demonstrate a cross-
over from preferential binding on acute vs. obtuse step edges of 
calcite as the chain length increases from 1 to 6. Such exquisite 
molecular control on crystal orientation not only underscores 
the intricacies of modeling real-world prebiotic organic selec-
tion and organization, but also remains a key to understanding 
biomineralization and applications to nano-engineering (De 
Yoreo and Dove 2004). Given these complexities, we conclude 
that any realistic modeling of interactions between biomolecules 
and mineral surfaces must take into account three-dimensional 
geometries of both molecules and surfaces.
A problem of combinatorics 
Experimental and theoretical studies provide useful insights 
regarding the interactions of speciﬁ c mineral-molecule pairs. 
Nevertheless, the case-by-case investigation of interactions be-
tween hundreds of different naturally occurring mineral surfaces 
(including myriad possible three-dimensional surface irregulari-
ties) and thousands of plausible prebiotic molecules presents a 
daunting problem in combinatorics. To gain a useful overview 
of the problem, we need a rapid screening method to determine 
which molecules adhere to which surfaces.
Accordingly, Hazen et al. (2004, 2006) have modiﬁ ed DNA 
microarray techniques to study mineral-molecule interactions. 
Microarray technologies exploit microﬂ uidic procedures to 
decorate solid surfaces with an array of ~100 μm diameter liq-
uid dots. Originally designed for high throughput data mining 
of genomes, a microarray can accommodate >106 separate tests 
on a 2 × 4 cm surface (Schena 2000). This technology thus is 
ideal for combinatoric screening of interactions between mineral 
surfaces and organic molecules (Holzwarth et al. 1998; Bunin et 
al. 1999; Korbel et al. 2001). 
We have developed protocols for cleaning mineral surfaces, 
spotting the surfaces with up to 96 different organic molecular 
species, washing the surfaces to remove non-adsorbed molecules, 
and analyzing the adsorbed molecules. In trial experiments, we 
used a TeleChem Spotbot microarrayer to print 0.7 nL spots of 
FMOC ﬂ uorescent labeled L-lysine onto left- and right-handed 
quartz (100) surfaces at eight different dilutions, each in triplicate 
to allow for surface variation. We scanned surfaces for ﬂ uores-
cence with a Genepix 4000B scanner, washed the surfaces with 
saline solution and then scanned again to observe preferential 
molecular binding post-wash (Fig. 7). We observed quantiﬁ able 
preferential retention of FMOC-tagged L-lysine on right-handed 
quartz (100) compared to that of left-handed quartz.  
Standard microarray techniques ﬁ nd their principal applica-
tions in tagged DNA or peptide sequences and are thus limited 
to ﬂ uorescent or colored molecules (Udenfriend et al. 1972; de 
Bernardo et al. 1974; Cheng and Dovichi 1988; Kobayashi and 
Chiba 1994, Kang and Vanderhoek 1998; Korbel et al. 2001; 
Kahr and Gurney 2001; Schena 2003). However, most plausible 
prebiotic molecules, including chiral amino acids, carboxylic ac-
ids, sugars, and lipids essential to life, are neither ﬂ uorescent nor 
colored. These species can be labeled with ﬂ uorescent tags, but 
such molecular tags will likely signiﬁ cantly alter adsorption be-
havior. Consequently, we have explored the use of time-of-ﬂ ight 
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) as an analytical 
tool to be coupled with microarray techniques (Vicenzi et al, 
work in preparation). ToF-SIMS is a reliable method for high-
resolution detection and imaging of molecules (up to thousands 
of daltons) across a sample ﬁ eld (Benninghoven 1970; Briggs 
1982; Vickerman et al. 1989). Each short pulse of primary ions 
emitted from a liquid Ga source produces a secondary ion mass 
spectrum via sputtering and mass separation in a drift tube. 
Only material from the uppermost molecular monolayers are 
desorbed and detected, thus making ToF-SIMS an extremely 
surface-sensitive technique. For example, recent studies have 
documented the surface detection of amino acids and pentose 
sugars adsorbed onto crystalline surfaces (Steele et al. 2001; 
Toporski and Steele 2004). 
In a typical experiment, we arrayed 13 different molecular 
species (pentose sugars and amino acids) onto a 1 × 1 × 0.3 cm 
(010) plate of albite. Each molecule was printed in triplicate at 
each of three dilutions (0.05, 0.5, and 1 M), thus yielding a 9 × 
13 array (Fig. 8). Once an array is printed, ToF-SIMS analysis 
yields numerous spatially resolved mass fragments for each 
spot (Fig. 9). Pentose sugars, for example, produce charac-
teristic C2H3O fragments at 43.02 mass units, whereas amino 
acids produce characteristic C2H5N fragments at 43.04 mass 
units. The intensity ratio of two such ion fragments, therefore, 
has the potential to indicate relative concentrations of different 
competing adsorbed molecular species. Furthermore, ratios of 
these molecular ion peaks to those of ion masses characteristic 
of the mineral surface (such as feldspar Si and Al ions) have 
the potential to reveal relative adsorption of different molecular 
species (Fig. 10).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Understanding prebiotic molecular selection and concentra-
tion presents a daunting problem in combinatorial chemistry. The 
Hadean Earth must have held a wealth of interesting organic spe-
cies, as well as hundreds of different mineral surfaces possessing 
a variety of atomic-scale surface features. Microarray technology 
coupled with ToF-SIMS analysis represents an efﬁ cient approach 
to probing numerous mineral-molecule interactions. Once a 
promising pair has been identiﬁ ed, an arsenal of additional ex-
perimental and theoretical approaches can be brought to bear in 
an effort to document structural details of these interactions.

42CaH, whereas lysine is distinguished by the 42.04 mass of the C2H5N fragment, which is typical of amino acids (from Hazen et al. 2006).

HAZEN: MINERALS AND THE PREBIOTIC SELECTION OF BIOMOLECULES
1726
Mineral-induced selection, concentration, and organization 
of prebiotic molecules into viable macromolecules represent key 
emergent steps in life’s origins. These events set the stage for 
the emergence of self-replicating molecular assemblies (Rebek 
1994; Kauffman 1993; Lee et al. 1996, 1997; Yao et al. 1998; 
Hazen 2005a) and the consequent triggering of molecular natural 
selection and evolution. The appearance of such a competitive, 
replicating, chemical system represents the deﬁ ning transition 
from a geochemical to a biochemical world (Joyce 1994).
Our growing understanding of emergent complexity suggests 
that life’s origin may not be a random, improbable event. Many 
emergent steps are hard-wired into the fabric of the Cosmos. 
Given hydrogen atoms, stars follow inevitably. Given stars, the 
periodic table of elements emerges, and from those elements 
come Earth-like planets. And many scientists are convinced that 
life is equally a cosmic imperative given a habitable world and 
sufﬁ cient time (de Duve 1995; Morowitz 2002). 
The preceding naturalistic scenario for life’s origins troubles 
many people. How can one believe in a benevolent God if life 
ﬁ rst emerged by an undirected sequence of chemical reactions? 
How can humans be created in God’s image if evolution is an 
unscripted process of chance variations and competition?
Science can neither prove nor disprove the existence of God. 
Neither can science say whether or not the universe is imbued with 
meaning and purpose. But science remains our best hope of reveal-
ing the majesty of a Creation that is learning to know itself.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I thank the many individuals who have contributed to this origin-of-life re-
search effort. Harold Morowitz at George Mason University ﬁ rst coaxed me into 
this ﬁ eld in 1996. My Carnegie Institution colleagues Nabil Boctor, Jay Brandes, 
George Cody, Timothy Filley, Marilyn Fogel, and the late Hatten S. Yoder, Jr. were 
involved in studies of organic synthesis and analysis since our ﬁ rst experiments. 
Patrick Grifﬁ n collaborates on theoretical modeling of emergent systems. Studies 
of lipid self-organization are done in collaboration with David Deamer (University 
of California, Santa Cruz). Research on molecular selection on mineral surfaces 
was conducted with Aravind Asthagiri, Hugh Churchill, Gözen Ertem, Mary Ewell, 
and Matthieu Galvez (Carnegie Institution), Robert Downs (University of Arizona), 
Henry Teng and the late Glenn Goodfriend (George Washington University), Gifford 
Miller and Stephen Devogel (University of Colorado), David Sholl and Andrew 
Gellman (Carnegie-Mellon University), Dimitri Sverjensky (The Johns Hopkins 
University), and Antonio Salgado (University of Athens, Greece). Rebecca Martin, 
Jake Maule, and Andrew Steele (Carnegie Institution) developed the microarray 
procedures, while Edward Vincenzi and Detlef Rost (Smithsonian Institution) 
performed ToF-SIMS analyses. The manuscript beneﬁ ted from thoughtful and 
constructive reviews by Denis Bazilinski, Patricia Dove, and Katrina Edwards. I 
am grateful to the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the National Science Foundation, 
and the Carnegie Institution for support of this research.
