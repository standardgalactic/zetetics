Quasi-Classical Limit
N.P. Landsman
The quasi-classical limit of quantum mechanics refers, roughly speaking, to the
limit ℏ→0. Of course, ℏis a dimensionful constant, but in practice one studies
the semi-classical regime of a given quantum theory by forming a dimensionless
combination of ℏand other parameters; this combination then re-enters the theory
as if it were a dimensionless version of ℏthat can indeed be varied.
The oldest example of this procedure is Planck’s radiation formula  black body
radiation; Planck’s constant. Indeed, the observation of Einstein [5] and Planck [8]
that in the limit ℏν/kT →0 this formula converges to the classical equipartition law
may well be the ﬁrst use of the ℏ→0 limit of quantum theory; note that Einstein
put ℏν/kT →0 by letting ν →0 at ﬁxed T and ℏ, whereas Planck took T →∞
at ﬁxed ν and ℏ.
Another example is the one-particle  Schr¨odinger equation, where one may
pass to dimensionless parameters by introducing a typical energy scale ϵ and a typ-
ical length scale λ. In terms of the dimensionless variable ˜x = x/λ, the rescaled
Hamiltonian H/ϵ is then dimensionless and contains ℏthrough the dimensionless
variable ˜ℏ= ℏ/λ
√
2mϵ. In particular, large mass means effectively small ℏ.
Finally, as perhaps ﬁrst remarked by Bogoliubov [1], averages of N single-
particle operators satisfy commutation relations in which ℏhas been replaced by
ℏ/N, so that the limit ℏ→0 is effectively equivalent to the limit N →∞. This
remark lies at the basis of the quantum theory of macroscopic observables (see [19]
and references therein).
The quasi-classical limit has two separate aims, which should be sharply distin-
guished conceptually (although there is considerable overlap in the mathematical
techniques that are used):
1. The approximation of solutions to the quantum-mechanical equations of motion
(e.g. the Schr¨odinger equation) by solutions of the corresponding classical equa-
tions.
2. The derivation of classical mechanics, and more generally the explanation of the
appearance of the classical world, from quantum theory.

Q
The ﬁrst application is mathematically sophisticated but is conceptually quite
straightforward. The best-known technique is the WKB approximation, which goes
back to Wentzel [11], Kramers [7] and Brillouin [3] in 1926. In the case of the time-
independent Schr¨odinger equation, one postulates that the wave function has the
form
(x) = aℏ(x)e
i
ℏS(x),
(1)
where S is independent of ℏ, substitutes this Ansatz into the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, and expands in powers of ℏ. At lowest order this yields the (time-independent)
Hamilton-Jacobi equation H(∂S/∂x, x) = E, where H is the classical Hamiltonian.
This equation is supplemented by the so-called (homogeneous) transport equation

Higher-order terms in ℏyield further, inhomogeneous transport equations for the
expansion coefﬁcients aj(x) in aℏ= 
j ajℏj. These can be solved in a recursive
way, starting with (2). There are various problems with this method, the main ones
being convergence and the fact that in most cases of interest the Ansatz (1) is only
valid locally (in x), leading to problems with caustics. These problems have been
addressed in a sophisticated ﬁeld of mathematics called microlocal analysis [15, 18,
21]. The WKB method is of little use for chaotic systems and has to be replaced by
techniques surrounding the so-called Gutzwiller trace formula; see [16, 14].
Another insight dating back to the early days of (mature) quantum theory is
 Ehrenfest’s Theorem from 1927 [4], which states that for any wave function 
(in the domain of the position operator and of ∂V (x)/∂xj, where V is the potential)
one has
m d2
dt2 ⟨xj⟩(t) = −
-∂V (x)
∂xj
.
(t),
(3)
where the brackets ⟨· · · ⟩(t) denote expectation values in the time-dependent state
(t). This looks like Newton’s second law, with the tiny but crucial difference that
this law should have (∂V/∂xj)(⟨x⟩(t)) on the right-hand side. For further develop-
ments in this direction see [17], as well as the literature on microlocal analysis just
cited. In particular, Egorov’s Theorem in microlocal analysis is closely related to
Ehrenfest’s: it states that for a large class of Hamiltonians and classical observables
f one has Q(f )(t) = Q(ft) + O(ℏ). Here Q(f ) is the Weyl quantization of f
( Quantization) and the left-hand side evolves according to the quantum equation
of motion, whereas the right-hand side follows the classical one.
The last early idea we mention is the Wigner function ( Wigner distribution),
introduced in 1932 [12]. Namely, each wave function  (or, more generally, each
density matrix) deﬁnes a function W on classical phase space, deﬁned by
W(p, q) =

Rn dnv eipv(q + 1
2ℏv)(q −1
2ℏv).
(4)

This function has the property
(, Q(f )) =

R2n
dnpdnq
(2π)n W(p, q)f (p, q),
(5)
where ( , ) is the inner product in the Hilbert space L2(Rn) and Q(f ) is the
Weyl quantization of f as before. Thus the Wigner function transforms quantum-
mechanical expectation values into classical ones, with the proviso that W may fail
to be positive and therefore cannot strictly be interpreted as a classical phase space
distribution. Nonetheless, it is an extremely effective tool for studying the ℏ→0
limit [13].
The second application of the quasi-classical limit, i.e. to the explanation of the
classical world, is a very deep and largely unsolved problem (cf. [19]) for a survey).
To their credit, also here many of the key ideas date back to the founders of quantum
mechanics.
Bohr’s  correspondence principle [2, 10] was, in its original form, not con-
cerned with the classical limit of electronic orbits (but rather with the emitted
radiation, which for wide orbits behaves approximately classically). However, at
a later stage it was transformed into the general idea that large quantum numbers
should give rise to classical behaviour. Applied to atoms, this idea works if it is com-
bined with Schr¨odinger’s suggestion that particle behaviour emerges from  wave
mechanics by looking at  wave packets [9] (see [20] for a modern account). In
particular, semi-classical motion emerges if a localized wave packet is formed as
a superposition of tens of thousands of energy eigenfunctions with similarly large
 quantum numbers. Such a wave packet initially follows a time-evolution with
almost classical periodicity, but subsequently spreads out after a number of orbits.
During this second stage the (Born) probability distribution approximately ﬁlls the
classical orbit. On a much longer time scale one sees wave packet revival, in that the
wave packet recovers its initial localization. Then the whole cycle starts once again.
See [22] for a popular account and [23] for a technical review. Another success-
ful application of the correspondence principle is to the classical limit of quantum
partition functions [24].
Heisenberg’s famous 1927 paper [6] not only contained his uncertainty rela-
tions, but also suggested that the classical world emerged from quantum mechanics
through observation: ‘Die Bahn entsteht erst dadurch, daß wir sie beobachten.’
(‘The trajectory only comes into existence because we observe it.’) This idea has
to be combined with the quasi-classical limit in order to have the beginning of
an explanation of classical physics from quantum theory. Here modern methods
of  decoherence and  consistent histories play an important role.
