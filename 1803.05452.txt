Abstract: Previous work has shown that massless tree amplitudes of the type I and IIA/B
superstrings can be dramatically simpliﬁed by expressing them as double copies between
ﬁeld-theory amplitudes and scalar disk/sphere integrals, the latter containing all the α′-
corrections. In this work, we pinpoint similar double-copy constructions for the heterotic and
bosonic string theories using an α′-dependent ﬁeld theory and the same disk/sphere integrals.
Surprisingly, this ﬁeld theory, built out of dimension-six operators such as (DµF µν)2, has
previously appeared in the double-copy construction of conformal supergravity. We elaborate
on the α′ →∞limit in this picture and derive new amplitude relations for various gauge–
gravity theories from those of the heterotic string.

Introduction
Over the recent years, a surprising network of double-copy connections between seemingly-
unrelated ﬁeld and string theories has emerged. The most accurately studied example involves
the description of gravitational scattering amplitudes as “squares” of suitably-arranged gauge-
theory building blocks. At tree level, such relations between gravity- and gauge-theory am-
plitudes have been ﬁrst derived from string theory by Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT) in
1986 [1]. More than 20 years later, Bern, Carrasco, and one of the present authors (BCJ)
obtained a more ﬂexible formulation [2] of the tree-level KLT formula that admits loop-level
understanding of the gravitational double copy [3] and links it to a duality between color
and kinematics in gauge theory. The BCJ double copy has since become the state-of-the-art
method for computing multiloop amplitudes in supergravity [4–11].
A variety of further ﬁeld theories have been recently ﬁt into double-copy patterns, in-
cluding Einstein–Yang–Mills (EYM) theories [12–14], Born–Infeld, non-linear sigma models
of Goldstone bosons and special theories of Galileons [15], large/inﬁnite families of supergrav-
ities with reduced supersymmetry [16–18], and some simple examples of gauged supergravities
[19]. Particularly relevant to this work, the double copy has been extended to conformal su-
pergravities [20] with a construction involving a speciﬁc higher-derivative (DF)2 gauge theory.
The latter is built out of dimension-six operators and uniquely determined by the requirement
that its amplitudes obey the color-kinematics duality.
The Cachazo–He–Yuan (CHY) formulation [21–23] of ﬁeld-theory amplitudes, together
with its ambitwistor-string underpinnings [24, 25], has been a driving force to manifest or
generalize double copies. This is exempliﬁed by ref. [26] for EYM and ref. [27] for couplings
between non-linear sigma models and bi-adjoint scalars. The CHY formalism has been used
to derive amplitude relations between EYM and gauge theories [28–31], new representations
of loop amplitudes in super–Yang–Mills (SYM) and supergravity [32–34] as well as a one-loop
incarnation of the KLT formula [35, 36].
String theories with a ﬁnite tension α′−1 are a particularly well-established framework
to obtain a double-copy perspective on ﬁeld-theory amplitudes. Apart from the original tree-
level KLT formula [1], the BCJ relations [2] between color-ordered gauge-theory trees were
elegantly proven through the ﬁeld-theory limit α′ →0 of the monodromy relations [37, 38]
between open-string amplitudes (see [39–41] for recent extensions to loop level). Also, EYM
amplitude relations naturally descend from type-I superstrings [42] and heterotic strings [43].
Furthermore, string-theory methods allowed for the ﬁrst systematic construction of gauge-
theory amplitude representations where the color-kinematics duality is manifest: So far, this
has been achieved at tree level [44], one loop [45, 46] and two loops [47] with maximal
supersymmetry. Also, see refs. [48, 49] for one-loop advances at reduced supersymmetry and
[36] for cross-fertilization with the CHY formalism.
A remarkable result is that even the open superstring can be identiﬁed as a double copy
once the polarization dependence of its tree-level amplitudes is expressed via gauge-theory
trees [50]. In a suitable organization of the accompanying α′-dependent worldsheet integrals,
– 2 –

this decomposition of open-string amplitudes follows the pattern of the ﬁeld-theory KLT
formula [51].
This unexpected double-copy structure of the open superstring suggests an
interpretation of the moduli-space integrals over disk worldsheets as scattering amplitudes in
a putative eﬀective theory of scalars. The latter has been dubbed Z-theory and investigated
in view of its low-energy limit [52, 53] where couplings between non-linear sigma models and
bi-adjoint scalars are recovered as well as the α′-expansion of its non-linear ﬁeld equations
[54]. The Z-theory approach [52, 53] underpins the color-kinematics duality of non-linear
sigma models [15, 55] from a string-theory perspective and gives rise to the same amplitude
representations as the cubic action of Cheung and Shen [56].
According to the evidence
presented in ref. [57], the double-copy structure of the open superstring is expected to extend
to loop level.
Tree-level amplitudes of the open bosonic string are conjectured to admit the same double-
copy organization as observed for the superstring [58]. In a universal basis of disk integrals or
Z-theory amplitudes, the only diﬀerence between bosonic and supersymmetric strings resides
in the rational kinematic factors; these are α′-independent gauge-theory trees in the case
of the superstring [50], and more complicated rational functions of α′ in the case of the
bosonic string [58]. As a main result of this work, these α′-dependent kinematic factors of the
bosonic string will be reproduced from a speciﬁc ﬁeld-theory Lagrangian, thus pinpointing
the missing double-copy component of the open bosonic string. Surprisingly, this ﬁeld theory,
dubbed (DF)2 + YM, turns out to be a massive deformation of the (DF)2 theory entering the
double-copy construction for conformal supergravity [20]. More precisely, the (DF)2 + YM
theory, depending on α′ through its mass parameter, interpolates between pure Yang–Mills
(YM) theory (α′ →0) and the undeformed (DF)2 theory (α′ →∞).

table are completed in this work. The single-valued projection sv(•) converts disk to sphere integrals.
In addition to the double-copy representations for open-string amplitudes (ﬁrst row of
table 1), we will identify similar ﬁeld-theory constituents for gravitational amplitudes of the
closed bosonic and the heterotic string (second and third row, table 1). This will generalize
a simpliﬁed representation of massless tree amplitudes of the closed superstring where the
cancellations of various multiple zeta values in the α′-expansion are taken into account: The
– 3 –

selection rules applied to the multiple zeta values in passing from the open to the closed
superstring [59] are mathematically formalized by the so-called single-valued “sv” projection
[60, 61]. The closed superstring emerges from the double copy between SYM and the sv-
projected open superstring [62].
As pointed out in ref. [58], gravitational amplitudes of
superstrings, heterotic strings and bosonic strings only diﬀer in their ﬁeld-theory kinematic
factors. Hence, diﬀerent double copies involving one of SYM or (DF)2 + YM as well as a
single-valued open-string theory gives rise to the closed bosonic string or the gravity sector
of the heterotic string, see table 1.
As a second major novel result, we extend the collection of ﬁeld-theory double copies
to tree-level amplitudes involving any number of gauge- and gravity multiplets in the het-
erotic string.
For this purpose, bi-adjoint scalars are incorporated into the α′-dependent
(DF)2 + YM theory, resulting in the so-called (DF)2+YM+φ3 theory whose Lagrangian will
be given below. Upon double copying with the single-valued open superstring, this completes
the massless sector of the heterotic string, see the last column of table 1. The remaining
double-copy options involving (DF)2+YM+φ3 theory and one of Z-theory or the single-valued
open bosonic string yield compactiﬁed versions of bosonic string theories1.
In the low-energy limit α′ →0, the YM+φ3 theory, known from the double copy of
EYM [12, 13], can be obtained from the (DF)2+YM+φ3 theory. Hence, our double-copy
construction of the heterotic string encodes all EYM amplitude relations that reduce multi-
trace couplings of gluons and gravitons to pure gauge-theory amplitudes and should reproduce
the results of ref. [31]. The opposite limit α′ →∞of the (DF)2+YM+φ3 theory, on the other
hand, gives access to conformal supergravity coupled to gauge bosons upon double copy with
SYM. Indeed, in this regime, the double-copy amplitudes built from the (DF)2+YM+φ3
theory and SYM agree with those coming from the heterotic ambitwistor string, which were
studied in detail in ref. [65].
Finally, we will deduce from the CHY formulae, given in that reference, that amplitude
relations of conformal supergravity coupled to SYM are recovered in the α′ →∞limit of the
corresponding amplitude relations of the (conventional) heterotic string [43]. An alternative
way of arriving at conformal-gravity amplitudes via an α′ →∞limit involves the twisted-
string construction of Huang, Siegel and Yuan [66]. We show that taking this limit for the
twisted heterotic-string amplitudes one obtains precisely a KLT formula with the undeformed
(DF)2 theory and SYM amplitudes.
This paper is organized as follows: A review in section 2 sets the stage for introducing the
(DF)2 + YM theory and for explaining its signiﬁcance for the open and closed bosonic string
in section 3. The generalization of these results to the heterotic string is discussed in section
4 which allows to explore various corollaries for diﬀerent types of gauge-gravity theories in
the α′ →∞limit in section 5.
1The compactiﬁcation geometries can be taken to be two independent copies of the same sixteen-dimensional
internal manifolds as used for the non-supersymmetric chiral half of the heterotic string [63, 64], giving the
Lie group SO(32) or E8 × E8. More generally, the color degrees of freedom can be generalized to arbitrary Lie
groups since the tree-level amplitudes under discussion are not yet constrained by modular invariance.

Review
In this section, we review the known double-copy structure of tree-level amplitudes in various
string theories and conformal supergravity. This will set the stage for sections 3 and 4 where
we identify the ﬁeld theory that governs the polarization dependent kinematic factors of the
bosonic and heterotic string amplitudes.
For simplicity, throughout this paper the ﬁeld-
and string-theory amplitudes will be given without overall coupling-dependent prefactors.
Appropriate powers of the gauge coupling g and the gravitational coupling κ can be restored
following appendix A.
2.1
Open superstrings
The manifestly supersymmetric pure-spinor formalism [67] has been used to determine all
tree amplitudes of massless open-superstring states [50] in terms of simpler building blocks,
As(1, π(2, 3, . . . , n−2), n−1, n) =
X
ρ∈Sn−3
FπρASYM(1, ρ(2, 3, . . . , n−2), n−1, n) .
(2.1)
The sum runs over (n−3)! permutations ρ, and the factor of ASYM refers to color-ordered
tree amplitudes of ten-dimensional SYM [68] which carry all of the polarization dependence
and supersymmetry. The α′-dependence, by contrast, is entirely carried by the integrals [50]

over moduli spaces of punctured disks which are taken to be in the SL(2, R) gauge with
(z1, zn−1, zn) = (0, 1, ∞). As is well known, the ASYM obeys BCJ relations [2] and As obeys
monodromy relations [37, 38]. The permutations ρ, π ∈Sn−3 are chosen such that the disk
integrals in (2.2) form independent (n−3)!-element bases under the BCJ and monodromy
relations, respectively. Thus, the Fπρ form an (n−3)! × (n−3)! matrix with entries indexed
by integration domains π and permutations ρ of integrand labels. The permutations ρ are
understood to act on the insertion labels as2

(2.5)
where the summation range τ, ρ ∈Sn−3 is suppressed here and in later equations for ease
of notation. This form is isomorphic to the ﬁeld-theory KLT formula, and the symmetric
(n −3)!-by-(n −3)! matrix S[τ|ρ]1 = S[τ(2, . . . , n−2)|ρ(2, . . . , n−2)]1 is the ﬁeld-theory KLT
kernel. For a ﬁxed choice of basis, the KLT kernel was ﬁrst written down to all multiplicity
in ref. [70] and later extended to more general basis choices in refs. [71–73]. Here we give a
compact recursive deﬁnition4 [52],
S[A, j|B, j, C]1 = (k1 + kB) · kj S[A|B, C]1 ,
S[2|2]1 = s12 ,
(2.6)
where multiparticle labels such as B = (b1, b2, . . . , bp) encompass multiple external legs and
kB = kb1 + kb2 + . . . + kbp denotes their region momentum.
Since the open-string amplitudes in eqs. (2.1) and (2.5) are expressed in a basis of SYM
amplitudes, the corresponding coeﬃcients are unique and thus equal to each other [69],
Fπρ =

(2.7)
For theories where all-multiplicity tree-level amplitudes can be expressed using the KLT
formula, we say that the theory (or a sector of a theory) is constructible as a double copy out
of a left and right theory. It is convenient to use a word formula, such as
(massless open superstring) = (Z-theory) ⊗(SYM) ,
(2.8)
that concisely expresses this statement. This context-free formula is useful since the dou-
ble copy can be expressed in many diﬀerent ways (for example, using the BCJ or CHY
frameworks), the KLT formula being just one instance of this. The slightly abusive speciﬁer
“massless open superstring” means that we only allow for massless external modes, although
massive open-string vibration modes still contribute to (2.2) and (2.4) via internal propaga-

(0, 1, ∞) while trading the integration measure dzi dzj dzk for a Jacobian |zijzikzjk|. Accordingly, the three-
point instances of the disk integrals (2.4) trivialize to Z(1, 2, 3|1, 2, 3) = 1 and Z(1, 2, 3|1, 3, 2) = −1.

– 6 –

tion. Both (2.8) and later double-copy statements on string amplitudes are understood to only
apply to massless external states, and we will suppress the speciﬁer “massless” henceforth.
Whether the Z-theory amplitudes (2.8) deﬁne a sensible theory or not is an interesting
open question. Evidence supporting an interpretation as a theory stems from the observation
that, at leading order in α′, the disk integrals (2.4) reproduce the doubly-partial amplitudes
of non-linear sigma models coupled to bi-adjoint scalars upon (partial) symmetrization in π
[52, 53]. Hence, the Z(π|ρ) integrals are interpreted as the doubly-partial amplitudes in a
collection of eﬀective scalar theories dubbed Z-theory which captures all the α′-dependence of
open-string amplitudes. The low-energy expansion of the Z-theory equations of motion can
be found in ref. [54].
2.2
Closed superstrings
For massless (gravitational) tree amplitudes of the closed type-IIA/B superstring, combining
two copies of the open-string worldsheet integrands in (2.1) leads to the structure [59],
MII =
X
τ,ρ,σ
˜ASYM(1, τ, n, n−1)S[τ|ρ]1(svF)ρσASYM(1, σ, n−1, n) ,
(2.9)
where the ﬁeld-theory KLT kernel is given by (2.6) and the type-IIA/B amplitudes are ob-
tained from each other by ﬂipping the relative chirality of the ten-dimensional N = (1, 0)
SYM theories. The summation ranges for permutations τ, ρ, σ ∈Sn−3 of 2, 3, . . . , n−2 are
again suppressed in (2.9) and later equations.
The notation svF in (2.9) refers to the single-valued projection [60, 61] of multiple zeta
values (MZVs)
ζn1,n2,...,nr ≡

0<k1<k2<...<kr

nr ≥2 ,
(2.10)
which arise in the low-energy expansion of open- and closed-string tree amplitudes [59, 74–
77]. More precisely, the wth order in the α′-expansion of the functions Fπρ in (2.2) exclusively
involves MZVs (2.10) of weight w = n1 + n2 + . . . + nr, so the Fπρ are said to exhibit uniform
transcendentality.
The matrix (svF)ρσ in (2.9) is built from moduli-space integrals over
punctured spheres whose α′-expansion can be conjecturally obtained from the open-string
functions Fρσ in (2.2) through the formal map [59, 62]
sv(ζ2) = 0 ,
sv(ζ2k+1) = 2ζ2k+1 ,
sv(ζ3,5) = −10ζ3ζ5 ,
. . .
(2.11)
acting on the MZVs in their low-energy expansion. The terminology for the single-valued
projection “sv” is motivated by the realization of sv(ζn1,n2,...,nr) via single-valued polyloga-
rithms at unit argument [60, 61, 78], see the references for a generalization of (2.11) to higher
weight and depth. The single-valued projection (2.11) preserves uniform transcendentality
and the product structure, sv(ζm1,m2,...ζn1,n2,...) = sv(ζm1,m2,...)sv(ζn1,n2,...). Further details
on the interplay of α′-expansions with the single-valued map are reviewed in appendix B.

First evidence for a similar correspondence between one-loop amplitudes of open and closed
strings has been given in [79].
Given that the factors ASYM in the open-string amplitude (2.1) are unaﬀected by the sv
operation, the closed-string amplitude (2.9) can be cast into a double-copy form [62]
MII =
X
τ,ρ
˜ASYM(1, τ, n, n−1)S[τ|ρ]1svAs(1, ρ, n−1, n) ,
(2.12)
where sv only acts on the open-string amplitudes.
The double copy for the closed-string
amplitude is then summarized by the word equation
(closed superstring) = (SYM) ⊗sv
 open superstring

,
(2.13)
which is understood to apply to massless external states according to our earlier disclaimer.
Alternatively, the double copy can be written more symmetrically by substituting eq. (2.8)
into eq. (2.13), giving a “triple copy”
(closed superstring) = (SYM) ⊗sv(Z-theory) ⊗(SYM) .
(2.14)
The corresponding KLT-like formula is
MII =
X
τ,π,σ,ρ
˜ASYM(1, τ, n, n−1)S[τ|π]1svZ(1, π, n−1, n|1, σ, n, n−1)S[σ|ρ]1ASYM(1, ρ, n−1, n) .
(2.15)
However, note that this “triple copy” is not a new concept, it simply amounts to applying
the double copy twice. Note that svZ(π|σ) can be interpreted as closed-string versions of
Z-theory amplitudes [54], and they are given by integrals [80]

over the moduli space of punctured Riemann spheres5.
5For the complex punctures zi of (2.16), the inverse factor of vol(SL(2, C)) amounts to ﬁxing three punctures
zi, zj, zk →(0, 1, ∞) while trading the integration measure d2zi d2zj d2zk for a Jacobian |zijzikzjk|2. The exact
closed-string normalization of α′ can be attained by replacing α′ →α′
4 in (2.16) and later equations on type-II,
heterotic-string and closed-bosonic-string amplitudes. We do not track this rescaling of α′ between open- and
closed-string setups to avoid the ubiquity of denominators.

Bosonic and heterotic strings
For the open bosonic string, n-point tree amplitudes were conjectured6 to have the same
expansion in terms of a basis of disk integrals (2.2) as for the open superstring [58],

The kinematic factors B, which will soon be identiﬁed with partial amplitudes of a spe-

additionally depend on α′. We give the lowest-multiplicity expressions in terms of gluon po-

and the YM tree-level amplitudes are normalized as exempliﬁed by the three-point case,
AYM(1, 2, 3) = 2(e1 · e2)(k1 · e3) + cyc(1, 2, 3) .
(2.20)
While B(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) at ﬁve points can be obtained from ref. [58], extracting the higher-
multiplicity generalizations7 from string theory is an open problem. Instead, we will later
on employ ﬁeld-theory techniques to obtain an all-multiplicity description of the kinematic
factors B in the bosonic-string amplitude (2.17).
Given that the geometric-series expansion of the factor (1 −2α′sij)−1 in (2.19) leads
to purely rational coeﬃcients for (α′sij)w, the amplitudes (2.17) of the open bosonic string
violate uniform transcendentality. Instead, the combination of the purely rational B and the
uniformly transcendental integrals Fπρ in (2.2) sets the upper bound that the order of α′w
involves MZV of weight ≤w. In particular, given the leading low-energy behavior
B(1, 2, . . . , n) = AYM(1, 2, . . . , n) + O(α′)
(2.21)
imposed by the ﬁeld-theory limit of (2.17), the pieces of maximal transcendentality in bosonic
open-string amplitudes, i.e. the contributions of weight-w MZVs at the order of α′w, coincide
with those of the superstring (2.1) [58].
Of course, the worldsheet integrand of the open bosonic string underlying (2.17) can be
exported to the gravitational sector of the heterotic string. Hence, the n-point tree amplitude
6The expectation for (2.17) to hold at all multiplicities N is based on the explicit checks at N ≤7 [58].
7The subleading order of B(1, 2, . . . , n) in α′ is governed by a deformation of SYM through a Tr(F 3)-
operator whose D-dimensional n-point tree amplitudes have been considered in ref. [81].

From the absence of MZVs in the α′-expansion of B, the piece of maximal transcendentality
at a given order in α′ is universal to gravitational amplitudes in the closed superstring, the
heterotic string and the closed bosonic string [58].
The structure of the bosonic- and heterotic-string amplitudes (2.17), (2.22) and (2.23)
matches the open- and closed-superstring results for As and MII. Hence, the results reviewed
in this section imply that the gravity sector of the bosonic and heterotic string exhibits a
double-copy structure. Indeed, we will pinpoint a gauge theory in section 3 which furnishes
the bosonic double-copy component and takes the role of SYM in (2.8) and (2.13).

Field-theory BCJ relations for string amplitudes
As a common property of the constituents in the above string double copies, they are all
required to obey the BCJ relations of gauge-theory tree amplitudes [2], e.g.
n−1
X
j=2
k1 · (k2+k3+ . . . +kj)ASYM(2, 3, . . . , j, 1, j+1, . . . , n) = 0 .
(2.24)
Given that total derivatives in the worldsheet punctures integrate to zero, the same relations
hold for diﬀerent choices of the right argument ρ in the Z-theory amplitudes Z(π|ρ) in (2.4)
with a ﬁxed integration domain π [51]. Accordingly, the single-valued Z-theory amplitudes
(2.16) obey BCJ relations for either the left or right argument.
For open-string amplitudes As(π) or Abos(π), diﬀerent disk orderings π are constrained
by the generalization of the BCJ relations (2.24) to monodromy relations [37, 38].
They
augment the BCJ relations by a series expansion in ζ2(α′sij)2 which preserve the uniform
transcendentality of the superstring. As ﬁrstly pointed out in ref. [82], monodromy relations
can be projected separately to any order in α′ and to any MZV which is (conjecturally) inde-
pendent over Q. Truncating the monodromy relations among (2.17) to zero transcendentality

reasoning implies that also single-valued open-string amplitudes satisfy the BCJ relations [80]

8Note that the conformal supergravities do not inherit the explicit dependence on the gauge group and
coupling, these are only introduced in order to deﬁne the non-abelian gauge theory.
Only the kinematic
structure of the gauge theory is transferred to the conformal supergravities through the double copy.
– 11 –

Requiring that the tensors Cαab, dαβγ and T a
R transform covariantly under inﬁnitesimal gauge-
group rotations implies three additional Lie-algebra relations.
Together, these ﬁve tensor
relations are suﬃcient to reduce any color structure appearing in a pure-gluon tree amplitude
to contractions of f abc tensors. See appendix B in ref. [20] for all of these identities.
Tree-level gluon amplitudes of the so-called (DF)2 theory deﬁned by the Lagrangian
(2.28) have been shown to obey BCJ relations (2.24) up to at least eight points. The color-
kinematics duality guarantees [14] that the double copy will give amplitudes that are invariant
under space-time diﬀeomorphisms, i.e. amplitudes in a gravitational theory. In terms of tree-
level amplitudes, the double copy (2.27) for conformal supergravity can be expressed using
the standard KLT formula,
MCSG =
X
τ,ρ
A(DF )2(1, τ, n, n−1)S[τ|ρ]1ASYM(1, ρ, n−1, n) ,
(2.31)
where the external states of the (DF)2 amplitude are restricted to gluons in order to obtain
graviton amplitudes in the double copy.
A curious feature of the tree-level amplitudes of (DF)2 theory is that the product between
any two polarization vectors ei · ej always cancels out through non-trivial identities [20], e.g.
A(DF )2(1, 2, 3) = −4(e1 · k2)(e2 · k3)(e3 · k1)

It implies that when considering dimensional reduction, the scalars that come from the extra-
dimensional gluon components will automatically decouple from the theory.
In the CHY
formulation of (DF)2 theory given in [65] the ei · ej are manifestly absent. The double poles
∼s−2
12 in (2.32) reﬂect a gluon propagator ∼k−4 due to the four-derivative kinetic term in the
Lagrangian (2.28), and the unusual s13-channel pole in A(DF )2(1, 2, 3, 4) that deﬁes the naive
expectation from the color ordering, is due to an exchange of the ϕα scalar. This exchange
follows from the coupling ∼CαabϕαF a
µνF bµν in the Lagrangian (2.28) along with the structure
constants generated from the contraction CαabCαcd, see (2.30).

Bosonic string amplitudes from the double copy
In this section, we will consider the extended gauge theory (DF)2 + YM and argue that
massless tree amplitudes (2.17) and (2.23) of the open and closed bosonic string amount to
the following double-copy constructions

(3.3)
which augments (2.28) by mass-dependent terms also considered in ref. [20]. This (DF)2+YM
gauge theory smoothly interpolates between the previously introduced (DF)2 theory (m = 0)
and pure Yang–Mills theory (m = ∞). Its ﬁeld content comprises a massless gluon, a massive
gluon and a massive scalar (see appendix C.1 for the propagators). A priori, the mass is a
free parameter, but we will ﬁnd that it has to be related to the inverse string tension α′ by
m2 = −1
α′ .
(3.4)
Since m2 is negative, it gives rise to tachyonic modes, i.e. the massive gluon as well as the
massive scalar ϕα are tachyonic. In the context of the open and closed bosonic strings, this
reﬂects the appearance of scalar tachyon modes that propagate internally.
Note that the
Lagrangian (3.3) is normalized such that the limit m →0 (α′ →∞) is well behaved; for a
well-behaved limit m →∞(α′ →0) we need to multiply the Lagrangian by m−2 = −α′, which
explains such overall normalization factors appearing in some of the subsequent amplitudes.
Based on a few reasonable assumptions, we can argue that the Lagrangian (3.3) is the
unique ﬁeld theory that describes the kinematic factors B in the bosonic-string amplitudes,
B(1, 2, . . . , n) = −α′A(DF )2+YM(1, 2, . . . , n)

m2=−1/α′ ,
(3.5)
which results in the double-copy statements given in eq. (3.1). These assumptions are:
(i) In the low-energy limit α′ →0, the factors B become YM tree amplitudes.
(ii) In the high-energy limit α′ →∞, the B/α′ are ﬁnite and have at most poles s−2
i...j.
(iii) B are partial amplitudes coming from a bosonic gauge theory that obeys the color-
kinematics duality in (at least) D ≤26 dimensions.
The ﬁrst assumption (i) follows from the ﬁeld-theory limit of the construction of ref. [58], see
the discussion around (2.21). Assumption (ii) is an observed property of the explicit examples
given in the same paper. Moreover, the general validity of (ii) appears plausible since the limit
α′ →∞converts tachyon propagators ∼

propagators (ki +kj)−2. Since tachyon propagators usually line up with massless propagators
in moduli-space integrals9 the limit α′ →∞introduces double poles ∼s−2
ij
as for instance
seen in (2.32). Additional poles s−n
ij
of higher order n ≥3 do not occur since the OPE among
gluon vertex operators does not introduce any singularities |zij|2α′ki·kj−n with n ≥3 into the
worldsheet integrand. Finally, assumption (iii) is consistent with the observation [58] that the
B obeys the well-known relations of gauge-theory partial amplitudes: cyclicity, Kleiss–Kuijf
and BCJ relations.
Under the above three assumptions, both limits α′ →0, ∞of B result in gauge-theory
amplitudes that have no dimensionful parameter. It is thus a simple task to list all possible
operators of a given dimension in the underlying gauge-theory Lagrangians and to constrain
unknown couplings using color-kinematics duality. From dimensional analysis, it follows that
the limit α′ →0 is dominated by dimension-four operators (in D = 4 counting), and α′ →∞
is dominated by dimension-six operators (in D = 6 counting). In ref. [20] it was shown that
there is a unique color-kinematics satisfying dimension-six Lagrangian that is built out of
parity-invariant10 operators involving Fµν’s and the scalar ϕα, and where the kinetic terms
have at most four derivatives.
Once the dimension-four YM term, (F a
µν)2, is introduced,
there exists a one-parameter solution to the constraints of color-kinematics duality [20], this
free parameter is the mass m and the resulting Lagrangian the one in eq. (3.3). By mutual
consistency of the three assumptions, m2 has to be proportional to (α′)−1.
Color-stripped amplitudes A(DF )2+YM up to multiplicity eight are straightforward to
compute from the Feynman rules of the Lagrangian (3.3).
We have conﬁrmed that they
reproduce all known kinematic factors B coming from the open-bosonic-string amplitudes
(2.17), given that the mass is identiﬁed with α′ as in eq. (3.4).
More precisely we have
derived (2.18) and (2.19) at three and four points as well as the expression for B(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
in the arXiv submission of ref. [58] from the gauge-theory Lagrangian (3.3). These checks
and the plausibility of the assumptions (i) to (iii) provide strong evidence for our general
conjecture (3.5) on the ﬁeld-theory description of B. The latter in turn implies the double-
copy structures (3.1) of the massless sector of bosonic open- and closed-string theories.

The structure of heterotic string amplitudes
Given that the gauge and gravity multiplets of the heterotic string couple via genus-zero
worldsheets, already the gauge sector exhibits structureful tree-level amplitudes with multiple
traces of the color factors. Single-trace amplitudes Ahet can be obtained from the single-valued
projection [80]
Ahet(1, 2, . . . , n) = svAs(1, 2, . . . , n)
(4.7)
of the type-I results (2.1). Double-trace amplitudes of gauge multiplets in turn have been
reduced to linear combinations of their single-trace counterparts (4.7) [43]. The expansion
coeﬃcients in these double-trace results exemplify that multi-trace contributions generically
violate uniform transcendentality, and it is an open problem to generalize the explicit relations
– 15 –

of ref. [43] to higher numbers of traces. In fact, the Lagrangian given in the next subsection
will implicitly reduce any multi-trace sector to linear combinations of (4.7).
Mixed amplitudes Mg+h
het involving external gauge-multiplets g and gravity-multiplets h
can also be organized according to the trace structure of their color dependence. The single-
trace sector with ≤3 gravitons as well as the double-trace sector with ≤1 graviton has been
expressed in terms of the gauge amplitudes [43]. The amplitude relations of this reference

relations of this type are expected to exist for all multi-trace sectors of the heterotic string
and any number of gluons and gravitons [43, 80]. This would allow us to reduce the massless
tree-level S-matrix of the heterotic string to the same basis of sphere integrals seen in the
gravity sector (2.22) or the type-II string (2.9) and leads us to conjecture that

The factors of A(DF )2+YM+φ3(1, τ, n, n−1) capture the color degrees of freedom of the
gluons and the extra polarization vectors of the gravitons such as ep and eq in (4.8) and
(4.9). Given that the factors of ASYM within As contribute gauge-multiplet polarizations,
the external states in (4.10) are gauge and gravity multiplets if A(DF )2+YM+φ3(1, τ, n, n−1)
involve external scalars s and gluons g, respectively. Denoting their appearance in the ith

appendix A. Note that the heterotic-string amplitudes (4.10) are understood to comprise at
least two external gluons, and the purely gravitational cases requiring a diﬀerent bookkeeping
of normalization factors are captured by (2.22).

with F 3 deﬁned in (2.29). This augments the Lagrangian (3.3) by massless13 scalars φaA
that are charged under a global group Ghet as well as the local gauge group G. We treat it
as a single ﬁeld that carries adjoint gauge-group indices a, b, c, . . . and global-group adjoint
indices A, B, C, . . ., and this allows for a cubic scalar self-interaction with an unconstrained
and dimensionless coupling λ. Note that the global group Ghet becomes the gauge group of
the heterotic string after the double copy (4.5) is performed, and in the tree-level context of
this work, Ghet can be generalized beyond the rank-sixteen cases realized by compactiﬁcation
of sixteen spacetime dimensions [63, 64]. As for the (DF)2+YM theory, the Lagrangian (4.14)
is normalized such that the limit m →0 (α′ →∞) is well behaved. For a well-behaved limit
m →∞(α′ →0) in turn, we need to multiply the Lagrangian by m−2 = −α′, and rescale
the bi-adjoint scalar φaA →mφaA and redeﬁne its self-coupling mλ = λ′, which explains why
such steps are needed in some of the subsequent formulas.
The kinematic factors A(DF )2+YM+φ3 appearing in the massless heterotic-string ampli-
tudes (4.10) we claim to arise from the partial tree-level amplitudes of the Lagrangian (4.14)
after color-decomposing with respect to the local gauge group G. As exempliﬁed by (4.11)
and (4.12), these color-ordered amplitudes still depend on the degrees of freedom of the global
group Ghet through the appearance of δAB and ˆf ABC tensors.
That the identiﬁcation of the kinematic factor in eq. (4.10) is correct can be argued
through similar considerations as in section 3. By considering the A(DF )2+YM+φ3 as unknown
factors appearing in the massless heterotic-string amplitudes, we assume the following minimal
properties (in addition to the properties already considered for the B amplitudes in section 3),
(i) In the low-energy limit −1/α′ = m2 →∞combined with the abelian limit of Ghet
(λ →0), the factors A(DF )2+YM+φ3 become tree amplitudes in 26-dimensional YM
theory dimensionally reduced to D = 10, where the scalars arise as internal components
of the gluons.
(ii) In the limit λ →∞, the multi-trace terms of A(DF )2+YM+φ3 are suppressed, and their
pure-scalar sector gives trivial φ3 tree amplitudes.
(iii) A(DF )2+YM+φ3 are partial amplitudes coming from a bosonic gauge theory that obeys
the color-kinematics duality in (at least) D ≤10 dimensions.
The ﬁrst property comes from the knowledge that heterotic-string amplitudes in the ﬁeld-
theory limit and abelian limit become double copies between 26-dimensional YM theory and
ten-dimensional SYM [63, 64]. The second property comes from considering gluon scattering
at tree level in the heterotic string and taking the gauge-group coupling to be large in com-
parison to the gravitational coupling in units of α′. This limit can be implemented via λ →∞
which gives single-trace amplitudes of uniform transcendentality, consistent with the single-
valued projection (4.7) of the open-string amplitudes [80]. A double copy with φ3 amplitudes

double copy with YM amplitudes, see [13] for a double-copy description of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

on one side is equivalent to the identity operation, and thus property (ii) is consistent with
eq. (4.5). Assumption (iii) follows from (4.13) based on the arguments in appendix C.3.
The amplitudes obtained from the Lagrangian (4.14) obey all of the above properties,
and have the right behaviour in the limits α′ →0 and α′ →∞(see section 3 for the analogous
α′ →0, ∞properties in case of the kinematic factors of the bosonic string). From the analysis
in ref. [20], L(DF )2+YM+φ3 given in (4.14) is the unique Lagrangian with these properties.
More on property (i): Property (i) deserves some further explanation as it is not
obvious from simply staring at the Lagrangian (4.14).
After the rescaling φaA →mφaA,
the limit m →∞and λ →0 can be taken by keeping all terms proportional to m2 and
dropping the rest. The ϕα is now an auxiliary ﬁeld that can be integrated out, this gives the
φ4 interaction that is typical of dimensionally reduced YM theory:

(4.15)
where the overall m2 has been removed by a trivial rescaling. Note that since we obtain
dimensionally reduced YM theory, we can simply think of the φaA scalars as being the extra-
dimensional gluons coming from the 26-dimensional theory. This interpretation works even
for ﬁnite m, but in the limit m →0 the interpretation breaks down (as previously men-
tioned, dimensional reductions of the pure (DF)2 theory yield scalars that automatically
decouple [20]).
More on property (ii): To elaborate on a stronger version of property (ii), we may take
the m →∞limit of the Lagrangian (4.14) while keeping the product λ′ ≡mλ ﬁnite (which
is now a dimensionful coupling constant). This yields the YM + φ3 Lagrangian introduced in
ref. [12],

which gives rise to (possibly supersymmetric) EYM upon double-copy with (S)YM. The claim
(4.5) is consistent with the α′ →0 limit (λ′ = mλ ﬁnite), where the heterotic-string amplitude
(4.10) should reproduce the KLT formula

where ns is the number of external scalars, and thus this generalizes the low-energy limit
of the pure-gluon amplitudes (2.21). Note that the purpose of inserting an overall factor of
mns−2 and redeﬁnition of λ is to make the dimensions agree on the two sides of the equality.
(Accordingly, the α′ →0 limit of the heterotic amplitude (4.10) needs the analogous rescaling.)
Consistency as α′ →∞: The compatibility of the double copy (4.10) with the La-
grangian (4.14) in the opposite limit m →0 can also be seen. Correlation functions of the het-
erotic string again yield worldsheet integrals whose expansion in a uniform-transcendentality
basis of (svF)ρσ involves coeﬃcients ∼
2α′
2α′si...j−1. As explained in section 3, the latter usually
line up with massless propagators s−1
i...j such that the limit α′ →∞introduces double poles
s−2
i...j into A(DF )2+YM+φ3 as expected from the massless limit of (4.14).
Relating α′ to the mass parameter of (DF)2 + YM + φ3 theory: At this point, one
can also see that the mass parameter m2 = −(α′)−1 of (4.14) needs to be interlocked with
α′ in the Koba–Nielsen factor of the disk integrals (2.2) and their single-valued projection.
Our argument is based on the level-matching condition for left- and right-moving degrees of
freedom which removes the tachyon from the heterotic-string spectrum. Tachyon propagation
in massless four-point amplitudes of the heterotic string is suppressed by the zeros of the
Virasoro–Shapiro factor
svAs(1, 2, 3, 4) = Γ(1 + 2α′s12)Γ(1 + 2α′s13)Γ(1 + 2α′s23)
Γ(1 −2α′s12)Γ(1 −2α′s13)Γ(1 −2α′s23) ASYM(1, 2, 3, 4)
(4.19)
at 2sij = α′−1. Like this, the tentative tachyon poles (1−2α′s12)−1 of the four-point examples
A(DF )2+YM+φ3(1, 2, 3, 4) in (4.12) are cancelled by the factor of Γ(1−2α′s12)−1 within (4.19).
This cancellation crucially depends on having the same value of α′ in the two sides of the
double copy (4.10).
These arguments can be repeated in the context of the closed bosonic string: The double
copy of the kinematic factors B in the tree amplitudes (2.23) of the closed bosonic string
introduces double poles at 2sij = −m2. Once the mass parameter of the underlying (DF)2 +
YM theory is adjusted to α′, these double poles conspire with the zeros of the accompanying
sphere integrals at 2sij = α′−1. Hence, the ﬁeld-theory mass parameter must be related to
α′ in order to arrive at the kinematic pole structure for tachyon propagation.
The above discussion is tailored to open-string conventions for the normalization of α′.
The conventional closed-string normalization of α′ in (4.19) and related equations can be
attained by replacing α′ →α′
4 which identiﬁes the mass of the closed-string tachyon to be
twice the mass of the open-string tachyon.
Explicit checks: Amplitudes up to multiplicity eight can be straightforwardly com-
puted from the Feynman rules of the (DF)2 + YM + φ3 theory (see appendix C.1); we have
explicitly checked that these agree with all the corresponding kinematic factors extracted from
heterotic string amplitudes up to multiplicity ﬁve, as well as the triple-trace color structure14

Gauge-gravity amplitude relations and CSG from α′ →∞
This section is dedicated to ﬁeld-theory implications of our double-copy representations of
string amplitudes.
We discuss some connections between the α′ →∞limit of heterotic-
string amplitudes and those of conformal gravity, including its coupling to gauge theories. In
this limit, the double-copy structure of the heterotic string is explained to imply amplitude
relations in more exotic examples of gauge-gravity theories, see section 5.2 below.
5.1
Amplitude relations for conformal supergravity coupled to gauge bosons
As reviewed in section 2.5, the α′ →∞limit of the ((DF)2 + YM)-theory amplitudes can
be double copied with SYM to yield conformal-gravity amplitudes [20] of Berkovits-Witten
type [83] (see also [84, 85]). In ref. [65], it was shown that these conformal-gravity amplitudes
can also be obtained from the heterotic ambitwistor string. Given the relation between the
tensionless limit of usual string theory and ambitwistor strings [86–88], it is reasonable to
expect the α′ →∞limit of the heterotic-string relations (4.8) and (4.9) to apply to color-
stripped amplitudes ACSG+SYM in conformal supergravity coupled to gauge bosons.
Indeed, it will be shown in appendix D.1 through the CHY formalism that this is the
case for a small number of external gravitons. While the amplitude coeﬃcients in (4.8) for
the one-graviton case do not depend on α′ and allow for the immediate translation

the two-graviton relation (4.9) explicitly depends on α′ via ep·eq−2α′(ep·q)(eq·p)

see appendix D.1 for a detailed derivation from the CHY formalism. Note that CSG + SYM
is a ten-dimensional generalization of Witten’s twistor string theory [89] (including the con-
formal gravity sector that is often discarded). The generalization of (5.1) and (5.2) to three
– 21 –

gravitons, which can also be derived from the α′ →∞limit of the corresponding heterotic-
string relations [43], can be found in appendix D.2.
Further generalizations to arbitrary
numbers of gravitons and traces are encoded in the double-copy (4.10) along with the La-
grangian in section 4.2.
Since the CSG + SYM amplitudes can be obtained from the α′ →∞limit of the double
copy ((DF)2 + YM + φ3) ⊗SYM they correspond to a double copy between (DF)2 + φ3 and
SYM, where the Lagrangian for the (DF)2 +φ3 theory is obtained by setting m = 0 in (4.14).
From this fact it is clear that (5.2) can be used to straightforwardly identify BCJ numerators
of the (DF)2 + φ3 theory after writing the ASYM factors in a Kleiss–Kuijf basis, in similar
fashion to the method introduced in ref. [14] where corresponding EYM relations employ BCJ
numerators of the YM + φ3 theory; see ref. [14] for further details.
Further amplitude relations can be obtained for multi-trace sectors of CSG + SYM. In
appendix D.3, double-trace amplitudes ACSG+SYM({1, 2, . . . , r | r+1, . . . , n}) of the gauge mul-
tiplet associated with color factors Tr(T a1T a2 . . . T ar)Tr(T ar+1 . . . T an) are expressed in terms
of (single-trace) gauge-theory amplitudes, e.g.

The multiparticle generalization of these examples and the CHY integrand associated with
the double-trace sector can be found in appendix D.3.
5.2
More exotic examples of gauge-gravity theories
In this subsection, we will investigate more exotic gauge-gravity theories that can be obtained
by double-copying (DF)2 with massless gauge theories coupled to a bi-adjoint scalar. These
additional gauge-gravity theories will be argued to share the amplitude relations of either
EYM or CSG + SYM.
As shown in [65], the double copy of (DF)2 with itself produces the amplitudes of R3
(six-derivative) gravity coming from bosonic ambitwistor strings. If one instead considers
the double copy of (DF)2 with (DF)2 + φ3, one then obtains the amplitudes of R3 gravity
coupled to (DF)2 gauge bosons. Interestingly, given the similarity of the CHY integrands
of both theories [65], it is easy to show that the amplitude relations in this section and
appendices D.2 and D.3 can be carried over to this R3 + (DF)2 theory. For this purpose, the
amplitude subscripts in (5.1), (5.2) and their generalizations need to be adjusted according
to CSG+ SYM →R3 + (DF)2 and SYM →(DF)2, respectively. Since we show in this paper
that the amplitude relations for CSG + SYM are related to an α′ →∞limit, it is reasonable
to suspect the same is true for R3 + (DF)2. It would be interesting to identify the ﬁnite-α′
version of these relations.
In table 2 below we give an overview of possible double-copy constructions involving gauge
theories coupled to a bi-adjoint scalar. While the entries of R3 gravity and its couplings to
– 22 –

the (DF)2 theory have just been discussed, it remains to introduce one last gauge-gravity
theory: The entry “CG + (DF)2” in table 2 refers to conformal gravity coupled to (DF)2
gauge bosons.

The fact that the amplitudes coming from the theories in the last column of the table
satisfy the same type of relations suggests that the same is true for the next-to-last column.
Indeed, amplitudes of CG + (DF)2 will be argued to satisfy the same relations as EYM
amplitudes: For one graviton, one has

Similarly, for a higher number of gauge bosons and gravitons as well as for the multi-trace
sectors, one can export the amplitude relations of EYM [28, 30, 31, 42] by adjusting AEYM →
ACG+(DF )2 and ASYM →A(DF )2. In appendix D.4, we introduce the CHY integrand for the
CG + (DF)2 theory and justify the agreement of its amplitude relations with those of EYM.
5.3
Conformal-supergravity amplitudes and twisted heterotic strings
As pointed out by Huang, Siegel and Yuan [66], type-II amplitudes (2.9) can be converted
into those of supergravity by ﬂipping the sign of α′ in one of the open-string constituents of
their KLT representation. Introducing the notation
As(π(1, 2, . . . , n)) ≡As(π(1, 2, . . . , n))

(5.7)

for the formal α′ →−α′ operation, this statement is

(5.8)
where the α′-dressed KLT matrix Sα′[π|σ]1 is related to its ﬁeld-theory incarnation (2.6) by
promoting the momentum dependence to (k1+kB) · kj →sin(2πα′(k1+kB)·kj)
2πα′
with Sα′[2|2]1 =
sin(2πα′s12)
2πα′
. By the organization of the type-II amplitudes in ref. [59], the entire α′-dependence
has been explained [66] to drop out from (5.8) and only the supergravity amplitude remains.
As pointed out in [90], both (5.8) and the conventional string-theory KLT relations [1] may
be understood as a consequence of the so-called twisted period relations [91], a result in
intersection theory.
Since this cancellation of all MZVs can be traced back to properties of the sphere integrals,
the analogous combination with one of As replaced by Abos reduces to the kinematic factors

i.e. to the zero-transcendentality piece of the gravitational heterotic-string amplitude (2.22).
Following the discussion of section 3, the kinematic factors B of the bosonic string de-
generate to the double-copy constituent A(DF )2 of conformal supergravity when taking the
limit α′ →∞. Then, the right hand side of (5.9) reduces to the KLT representation (2.31)
of the tree amplitudes of conformal supergravity [20], i.e. we are led to the following new
representation:

(5.10)
Since the tensionless limit of these “twisted” heterotic string amplitudes gives the same result
as the ambitwistor strings, this is another way of seeing that the amplitudes coming from
the gravity sector of the heterotic ambitwistor string correspond to conformal-supergravity
amplitudes.
Likewise, we can compactify the bosonic-string factor of (5.10) to the same sixteen-
dimensional internal manifolds as used for the heterotic string, giving gauge groups SO(32)

lating these ten-dimensional amplitudes (5.12) to four dimensions, we obtain Witten’s twistor
string theory [89], and the corresponding scattering equations present in the Roiban–Spradlin–
Volovich (RSV) formula [92] are now a natural consequence of the α′ →∞limit, as originally
considered by Gross and Mende [93].

Summary and Outlook
In this work, we have proposed ﬁeld-theory double-copy structures for all massless tree-level
amplitudes of bosonic and heterotic strings. One side of the double copy comprises the same
Z-theory amplitudes or moduli-space integrals over punctured disk and sphere worldsheets
as seen in their superstring counterparts. The additional, non-supersymmetric double-copy
components speciﬁc to bosonic and heterotic strings are conjectured to descend from mas-
sive gauge theories whose Lagrangians are spelt out in the main text. These gauge-theory
Lagrangians are combinations of dimension-four and dimension-six operators whose relative
scaling is controlled by the mass parameter α′ = −m−2. The dimension-six part which domi-
nates in the α′ →∞limit is known as the (DF)2 gauge theory in the double-copy construction
of conformal supergravity [20].
Our results give particularly striking examples for the ubiquity of ﬁeld-theory structures
in string amplitudes and universal properties across diﬀerent string theories.
Apart from
the universal α′-dependent moduli-space integrals, tree-level amplitudes in diﬀerent string
theories are characterized by gauge theories which specify the kinematic factors. Properties
of the moduli-space integrals require these ﬁeld theories to obey the duality between color
and kinematics in the same way as the Z-theory amplitudes do. Given that the respective
string-theory context ﬁxes the mass dimensions and the particle content of the ﬁeld-theory
operators, the α′ →0, ∞behaviour and the color-kinematics duality uniquely specify the
extensions of the (DF)2 theory relevant to bosonic and heterotic strings.
We also showed that relations analogous to those of EYM hold for the amplitudes involv-
ing gauge and gravity multiplets in conformal (super-)gravity, and that they can be obtained
by taking the α′ →∞limit of the corresponding heterotic-string amplitudes. Since the the-
ory of gluons coupled to conformal gravity is precisely the one coming from the heterotic
ambitwistor string, our results add to the claims that the latter is more naturally associated
with the tensionless limit of ordinary strings.
While the results of this work only concern massless external states, the organization of
the moduli-space integrals into (n−3)! × (n−3)! bases should extend to scattering of massive
15In contrast to (4.18), the α′ →∞limit in (5.12) is performed at ﬁxed λ rather than at ﬁxed λ′ = mλ. By
the relative normalization (3.5) of B and A(DF )2+YM, there is no analogue of the factor α′−1 in (5.10).

string resonances [58]. It is conceivable that the accompanying kinematic factors depending
on the higher-spin polarizations can also be traced back to ﬁeld theories that generalize the
(DF)2 + YM + φ3 Lagrangian.
Another important line of follow-up research concerns loop amplitudes.
For massless
one-loop amplitudes of maximally supersymmetric open strings, a double-copy structure re-
sembling matrix elements of gravitational R4 operators has been recently proposed in ref. [57].
The (generalized) elliptic functions of the worldsheet punctures in the reference are tailored
to maximal supersymmetry, but the results of ref. [48] on one-loop open-string amplitudes in
orbifold compactiﬁcations might pave the way to generalizations with reduced supersymmetry.
It would be interesting to investigate similar double-copy structures in one-loop amplitudes
of bosonic and heterotic strings as well as higher-loop generalizations.
While the double-copy structure of string amplitudes is perturbative in the current con-
text, the fact that kinematic factors of type I, IIA/B and heterotic theories uniformly arise
from a ﬁeld-theory perspective, with a simple Lagrangian interpretation, suggests a connec-
tion to non-perturbative string dualities. Understanding the role of the (DF)2 + YM + φ3
gauge theory and Z-theory at loop level may shed new light on these dualities, such as the
heterotic/type-I duality [94], or even M-theory [95].

Single-valued MZVs in the α′-expansion
For tree amplitudes (2.2) and (2.9) of the open and closed superstring, the α′-expansion gives
rise to MZVs (2.10) in a uniformly transcendental pattern [59, 74–77]: The wth order in α′
is exclusively accompanied by MZVs (2.10) of weight w = n1 + n2 + . . . + nr. Moreover,
the (n−3)! × (n−3)! matrix form of (2.2) is suitable to relate coeﬃcients of diﬀerent MZVs
that are conjecturally independent over Q: Let Pw and Mw denote (n−3)! × (n−3)! matrices
whose coeﬃcients are degree-w polynomials in α′sij with rational coeﬃcients, then (upon

(B.1)
For instance, the coeﬃcient of ζ2ζ3 is a matrix product P2M3 involving the coeﬃcients P2 and
M3 of ζ2 and ζ3, and similarly, ζ3,5 is accompanied by a matrix commutator of M3 and M5
(see [59] for the continuation to higher weights and explanation of the rational prefactor 1
5).
The state-of-the-art-methods16 to obtain the explicit form of the Pw and Mw at n points
involve the Drinfeld associator [69] (also see [101]) or a Berends–Giele recursion for Z-theory
amplitudes [54]. Results up to and including seven points are available for download via [102].
Once the closed-string tree amplitude is cast into the form (2.9), the matrix svF can
be obtained by imposing certain selection rules on the MZVs in the analogous open-string
expansion (B.1) which are obscured by the string-theory KLT formula [1]. These selection
rules have been pinpointed to arbitrary weights [59] (see [77] for earlier work on weights ≤8)
and were later on identiﬁed [62] with the single-valued projection [60, 61]. As exempliﬁed by
the leading orders
svF = 1 + 2ζ3M3 + 2ζ5M5 + 2ζ2
3M2
3 + 2ζ7M7 + 2ζ3ζ5{M5, M3} + O(α′9) ,
(B.2)
the closed-string α′-expansion follows from (B.1) by acting with the single-valued projection
(2.11) [60, 61] on the MZVs, see the references for sv(ζn1,n2,...,nr) at higher weight and depth.

More on (DF)2 + YM + φ3 amplitudes
C.1
Feynman rules
As a gentle warning to the reader, we note that the gauge-theory Lagrangians throughout the
paper are given using a Lorentzian metric of mostly-minus signature. Amplitudes obtained
from standard Feynman-rule calculations in this metric are then compared with the string-
theory results after ﬂipping the metric signature. Consequently, all amplitudes found in the
paper use a mostly-plus metric.
We now collect the Feynman rules employed for calculations in the mass-deformed scalar-
coupled (DF)2 + YM + φ3 theory with Lagrangian (4.14). In mostly-minus signature, the
propagators for the gluon Aa
µ, scalars ϕα and φaA are as follows:
a1, µ1
a2, µ2
k
=
i ηµ1µ2δa1a2
k2(k2 −m2)
(C.1)
16An earlier all-multiplicity method is based on polylogarithm manipulations [51].
Moreover, ﬁve-point
expansions have been performed to arbitrary orders in α′ by exploiting the connection with hypergeometric
function [96, 97] (also see [98–100] for (N≤7)-point results at certain orders in α′).

BCJ relations of (DF)2 + YM + φ3 amplitudes
We shall now derive the BCJ relations (4.13) of the kinematic factors A(DF )2+YM+φ3 in
(4.10). The idea is to study the non-supersymmetric chiral half of the underlying heterotic-
string correlators involving the currents JA(z) and ∂Xµ(z) in an open-string setup. Such
disk correlators can be realized by augmenting the open bosonic string by vertex operators
V A(z) = JA(z)eik·X(z) of massless scalars which carry an additional adjoint degree of free-
dom A besides their Chan–Paton generators T a. Such vertex operators may be obtained
– 32 –

from compactiﬁcations of the open bosonic string in the geometries known from the non-
supersymmetric chiral half of the heterotic string and yield tree amplitudes

cf. (5.11).
Descending from a worldsheet of disk topology, the color-ordered amplitudes
(C.19) involving gluons and scalars satisfy the monodromy relations [37, 38]. Following the
ideas of ref. [58, 82], one may restrict the α′-expansion of these monodromy relations to
their contributions of lowest transcendentality.
Their imaginary parts then degenerate to
BCJ relations with Fπρ →δρ
π and yield the desired property (4.13) of A(DF )2+YM+φ3. Upon
inserting the Z-amplitude expansion (2.7) of the integrals Fπρ, (5.11) gives rise to the double-
copy construction of the compactiﬁed open bosonic string noted in table 1.

Derivation of explicit amplitude relations for conformal supergravity
D.1
CHY derivation of the one- and two-graviton relations
In this section, we will derive the amplitude relations (5.1) and (5.2) for conformal supergrav-
ity coupled to gauge bosons from their representation in the CHY formalism. To begin with,
recall the CHY integrand for an n-point color-ordered amplitude of the gauge multiplet,
ISYM
n
(1, 2, . . . , n) = C(1, 2, . . . , n) Pf′ Ψn({k, e, z}) ,
(D.1)
where C(1, 2, . . . , n) ≡(z12z23 . . . zn1)−1 is the Parke–Taylor factor.
The reduced Pfaﬃan
Pf′ Ψn({k, e, z}) of the usual CHY matrix depending on the momenta kj, the polarizations ej
and the complex coordinates zj on the Riemann sphere as well as the integration prescription
can be found in ref. [22]. The Pfaﬃan may be supersymmetrized via pure-spinor methods
[103], and the result coincides with the n-point correlators of the open pure-spinor superstring
[44, 50] after stripping oﬀthe Koba–Nielsen factor (see [104] for the detailed argument). The
expression (D.1) can be generalized to the single-trace sector of an r-graviton, n-gluon EYM
amplitude [26],
IEYM
n+r (1, 2, . . . , n; p1, . . . , pr) = C(1, 2, . . . , n) Pf Ψr({p, ep, z}) Pf′ Ψn+r({k, p, ek, ep, z}) ,
(D.2)
with graviton momenta p and polarizations ep. These expressions were used in ref. [28] to
prove relations equivalent to the α′ →0 limit of (4.8) and (4.9). Note that the r-particle
Pfaﬃan Pf Ψr({p, ep, z}) in (D.2) cannot be supersymmetrized.
For the theory of conformal supergravity coupled to gauge bosons, there is an expression
analogous to (D.2) which, as is implicit in [65], can be obtained from the heterotic ambitwistor

(D.3)
where W{I} denotes a product of the Lam–Yao cycles. The latter have been introduced in
ref. [105] and were later used in ref. [81] in the study of the CHY formulation of amplitudes
coming from theories involving higher-dimensional operators, such as F 3 for gauge theory
and R2 for gravity. In the particular case appearing in (D.3), it can be written in terms of
the diagonal elements of the C-block of Ψn+r as

(D.4)
We are now ready to prove that (4.8) literally translates into (5.1) for conformal gravity.
In fact, since Pf Ψr=1 = W1 = Cpp, the proof is identical to the one given in ref. [28], and
amounts to showing that, in this case,
Cpp =

(D.5)
with xj = k1+k2+ . . . +kj, see the reference for details. The similarity of the results in both
theories is of course not surprising since (4.8) has no explicit dependence on α′.
Moving on to the case with two gravitons, writing p1 ≡p and p2 ≡q, one has

Analogous expressions can be written for Cqq by swapping p and q. Now, comparing with the
expression for the Pfaﬃan in (D.2),
Pf Ψr=2 = C′

(D.8)
we see that again we can beneﬁt from the work done in the EYM case. Indeed, one im-
mediately sees that the manipulations involving the tensor structures (ep · xi)(eq · xj) and
(ep · xi)(eq · p) will be exactly the same in the conformal gravity theory, which implies that
– 34 –

both the ﬁrst and the third lines of (4.9) apply in this case. Once more, this could be expected
from the absence of explicit α′-dependence in those terms.
The last term in (D.6) has a new tensor structure w.r.t. the Pfaﬃan. However, it is very
similar in form to the last term in (D.8). In fact, the former can be obtained from the latter
by replacing (ep · eq) with s−1
pq (ep · q)(eq · p). This in turn ultimately implies that one can
perform such a substitution directly in the expression relating the (single-trace) scattering
amplitudes of two gravitons and n gluons in EYM to that of n+2 gluons, and thus obtain the
analogous expression in conformal supergravity. Doing so in the expression given in ref. [28],
we get an additive contribution of

which has precisely the same form as the α′ →∞limit of the second line of (4.9). This
reproduces the second line of (5.2) and completes the proof that the α′ →∞limit of the
heterotic-string relations (4.8) and (4.9) applies to conformal supergravity coupled to gauge
bosons.
D.2
The three-graviton relation
In order to conveniently represent amplitudes ACSG+SYM(1, 2, . . . , n; p, q, r) involving three
gravitons and n gluons in terms of gauge-theory amplitudes, we recursively deﬁne the shuﬄe
product of ordered sets P ≡{p1, p2, . . . , pm} and Q ≡{q1, q2, . . . , qn} of cardinality m and n,
respectively:
P
 ∅= ∅
 P = P ,
P
 Q = {p1(p2, . . . , pm
 Q)} + {q1(q2, . . . , qn)
 P} .
(D.10)
Then, the notation P
σ∈P
Q instructs to sum over all permutations σ of P ∪Q which preserve
the individual orderings of P and Q. This applies to the α′ →∞limit of the three-graviton
relation in ref. [43]

The double-trace sector of the n-gluon amplitude ACSG+SYM({1, 2, . . . , r | r+1, . . . , n}) can
also be related to (single-trace) gauge-theory amplitudes. The CHY integrand piece associated
with the double-trace sector of Tr(T a1T a2 . . . T ar)Tr(T ar+1 . . . T an) is (up to a sign) just a
product of the corresponding Parke–Taylor factors:
IR2YM
r,n−r ({1, 2, . . . , r | r+1, . . . , n}) = −C(1, 2, . . . , r) C(r+1, . . . , n) Pf′ Ψn({k, e, z}) .
(D.13)
Again, this comes naturally from ambitwistor-string correlators of gluon vertex operators,
which involve the same current-algebra OPEs as in ordinary heterotic string theory [106, 107].
The EYM version of (D.13) is given by [26]
IEYM
r,n−r({1, 2, . . . , r | r+1, . . . , n}) = s12···r C(1, 2, . . . , r) C(r+1, . . . , n) Pf′ Ψn({k, e, z}) ,
(D.14)
where s12···r ≡1
2(k1 + k2 + · · · + kr)2. Comparing (D.13) with (D.14), it is easy to see that
one can recycle the EYM double-trace amplitude relations derived in ref. [28] to obtain the
analogous relations for conformal gravity. Indeed, it suﬃces to multiply the right-hand side
– 36 –

of the former by −1/s12···r. The desired expression is thus
ACSG+SYM({1, 2, . . . , r | r+1, . . . , n}) =

which, as expected, has the same form as the α′ →∞limit of the corresponding (ordinary)
heterotic-string relations for double-trace amplitudes [43]

Note that the ordered set {r+1, τ, ℓ} in summation range for σ in (D.15) and (D.16) is
understood as inserting the permutation τ from the previous one in between legs r+1 and ℓ.

The CHY integrand for CG + (DF)2
The amplitude relations of EYM can be derived as a consequence of the CHY-half-integrand
C(1, 2, . . . , n) Pf Ψr({p, ep, z}) and its multi-trace generalizations [15, 26]. Hence, the ampli-
tude relations of EYM are unchanged when the second half-integrand Pf′ Ψn+r({k, p, ek, ep, z})
is replaced by a diﬀerent SL(2, C) covariant object. Given that EYM and the CG+(DF)2 the-
ory share a factor of AYM+φ3 in the KLT-form of their tree amplitudes, they must also share
the corresponding CHY-half-integrand C(1, 2, . . . , n) Pf Ψr({p, ep, z}) and its multi-trace gen-
eralizations. This proves our claim in subsection 5.2 on the matching of EYM and CG+(DF)2
amplitude relations. From the (DF)2 constituent in its double-copy structure, the CHY in-
tegrand of the single-trace sector of the CG + (DF)2 theory is given by
IR2(DF )2
n+r
(1, 2, . . . , n; p1, . . . , pr) = C(1, 2, . . . , n) Pf Ψr({p, ep, z}) W11 · · · 1
| {z }
n+r
({k, p, ek, ep, z})
(D.17)
with the W11···1-factor deﬁned in (D.4).
