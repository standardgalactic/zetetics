Strong local passivity is a property of multipartite quantum systems from which it is impossible to
locally extract energy. A popular example is the vacuum state of a quantum ﬁeld theory from which
it is impossible to extract zero-point energy.
However, adding classical communication between
diﬀerent partitions of the system through so-called ‘quantum energy teleportation’ protocols makes it
possible to activate local energy of strong local passive states, including the ground state of quantum
systems if this state displays entanglement. Here we report the ﬁrst experimental realization of
both the activation of a strong local passive state and the demonstration of a quantum energy
teleportation protocol by using nuclear magnetic resonance on a bipartite quantum system.
Introduction.– Methods to extract and transfer energy
from physical systems at the quantum scale have been de-
veloped recently using tools from quantum information
processing and quantum thermodynamics [1–23].
But
can these tools allow us to activate energy extraction
from quantum systems in which the presence of entangle-
ment locks outgoing energy ﬂows through general local
interactions [24, 25]? Furthermore, can these quantum
information tools activate energy locally hidden in re-
gions of an entangled ground state? One may be tempted
to answer ‘no’, since this sounds akin to the activation of
zero-point energy, which is widely believed to be impos-
sible. However, we will discuss that the answer to these
questions is nuanced and that zero-point energy density
can be activated using quantum informational tools.
The quantum states from which any local action that
attempts to extract energy through a single subsystem
would fail, merely boosting the total energy across the
system, receive the name of strong local passive (SLP)
states [24, 25], see Fig. 1, also known as CP-local passive
states. This distinctive property of strong local passiv-
ity in a quantum system is associated with the presence
of entanglement in the low-energy eigenstates, as well as
the limitations to creating correlations within the system
via local operations alone. Indeed, a suﬃcient condition
for a quantum system to exhibit this phenomenon is to
have a Hamiltonian with a non-degenerate fully entan-
gled ground state, for which there will be a threshold
population probability (and a critical temperature for the
case of Gibbs states) to be in an SLP state [24]. The
necessary and suﬃcient conditions to have this property
were presented as a theorem in [25].
Strong local passivity provides new insights into under-
standing the emergent thermodynamic behavior arising
from the interplay between entanglement and localiza-
tion, such as understanding the allowed ﬂows of energy
and information within an entangled quantum system.
Along these lines, a fundamental question is how/when

FIG. 1. (a) A quantum state is deﬁned to be strong local pas-
sive with respect to a subsystem if no general local quantum
operation G (given by CPTP maps, the most general type
of local access) applied on the subsystem can extract energy

strong local passivity can be broken. Finding methods to
activate the non directly available energy in SLP states
can bring fascinating physical scenarios. One of them is
the case of activating entangled ground states. An en-
tangled ground state of a multipartite quantum system
can possess regions with positive (and negative) energy
density due to its entanglement. However, any locally
positive energy density is not directly available since any
action attempting to extract it directly will only give en-
ergy to the whole system. Would it be possible to activate
this energy by driving the system out of the ground state
in a diﬀerent way?
This question was answered by Masahiro Hotta, who
showed that, under some conditions, it is possible to ac-
tivate strong local passive states by allowing local op-
erations and classical communication (LOCC) to exploit
correlations between distant points of the system [24, 26–
33].
He introduced the family of protocols known un-
der the general name of quantum energy teleportation
(QET). Speciﬁcally, in a QET protocol, ﬁrst, a local re-

mote measurement is made on a subsystem (A), far from
the subsystem where the energy is blocked (B), and then
the outcome is communicated to B. Because of the corre-
lations, the information gained allows B, to some extent,
to predict and design an informed local operation to ac-
tivate the previously inaccessible energy, see Fig. 1. It
is important to note that the energy injected during A’s
measurement does not disappear from A’s surroundings,
nor appears around B. The protocol guarantees this by
using measurement operators that commute with both
the local Hamiltonian of B and the interacting Hamilto-
nian term for A and B. This means that if the system was
originally in an entangled ground state, the QET proto-
col could excite and drive the system’s state in such a
way that activation of regions with initially zero-point
energy can be possible, as was shown for the activation
of the vacuum state of a ﬁeld theory [30]. Beyond the
importance of QET in the activation of passive states,
QET has also been suggested to be relevant to under-
standing a broad range of situations – from the black-hole
information loss problem [26, 34–36] and violations of en-
ergy conditions in quantum ﬁeld theory in curved space-
times [37], to technological applications to local cooling
of many-body systems with restricted measurements [12].
However, QET had not yet been realized in an exper-
iment. Experimental proposals did exist (for instance,
using a semiconductor exhibiting the quantum Hall ef-
fect [38]), but no actual experiments. This work presents
the ﬁrst experimental realization of quantum energy tele-
portation, demonstrating both energy extraction from a
strong local passive state and the activation of local zero-
point energy density.
The experiment was carried out
using nuclear magnetic resonance on a system of three
qubits in the ground state of an interacting simulated
Hamiltonian.
The experimental results show local en-
ergy extraction from a subsystem with respect to which
a quantum state is SLP, beyond local and environmental
noise, without energy transfer through the system. Our
experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the control re-
quired for a QET protocol and the evidence of activation
of local zero-point energy density in an entangled ground
state under experimental conditions.
Furthermore, we
present an optimized fully-unitary QET model and an
analytical solution for the maximum extractable energy
via QET protocols, providing a physical understanding
of upper bounds derived in previous work [32].
We start with a summary of the minimal QET
model [32] to explain how it is possible to break strong
local passivity, particularly to activate regions of an en-
tangled ground state. Then, we present our optimized
fully unitary version of QET implemented in the experi-
ment. Finally, we show the experimental results of energy
activated in strong local passive states and conclusions.
Minimal QET model.—
Consider two interacting
qubits, A and B, with a Hamiltonian that has a non-
degenerate fully entangled ground state. An example of
such a Hamiltonian is
H = Ha + Hb + V,
(1)
with Hν = −hνσν
z + hνf(ha, hb, κ)11, for ν ∈{A, B} and
V = 2κσa

f(ha, hb, κ)11.
(2)
where ha, hb and κ are positive constants and the
function f(ha, hb, κ) is chosen such that the ground
state of the full Hamiltonian, |g⟩, has vanishing ex-
pectation values for each term of the Hamiltonian (i.e.
⟨g| HA |g⟩= ⟨g| HB |g⟩= ⟨g| V |g⟩= 0), for convenience
and without loss of generality. In particular for this case,
f(ha, hb, κ) := (ha + hb) /
q
4κ2 + (ha + hb)2.
The system has a non-degenerate fully entangled
ground state |g⟩,
|g⟩=

where F± =

1 ± f(ha, hb, κ), satisfying the suﬃcient
condition to have SLP states (see ref. [24] for its critical
temperature and threshold probability). Note that, while
the total Hamiltonian is a nonnegative operator (H ≥0,
since its lowest eigenvalue is zero) Hb and Hb + V have
negative eigenvalues which could yield negative energy
density at B. The QET protocol can locally activate that
energy in B surroundings as described below.

FIG. 2. Minimal QET protocol diagram.
The minimal QET protocol consists of the following
steps implemented by Alice and Bob (Fig. 2):
Step 1. Alice measures subsystem A using a POVM
with measurement operators that commute with Hb and
V to ensure that the energy injected during the measure-
ment on A does not raise the energy on B.
Step 2. Alice communicates the result of the measure-
ment, µ, to Bob in a time tµ shorter than the coupling
time scale tc ∼1/κ; to avoid that the energy infused on
A in the ﬁrst step propagates to B during that time.

3
Step 3. Based on the outcome µ, Bob implements an
optimized local unitary on B, UB (µ), to extract energy
locally through B.
Note that the extracted energy corresponds only to
previously locked energy in B’s surroundings since the
steps are designed so that no energy is propagated from
A to B during the protocol.
The total eﬀect of repeatedly and identically applying
the QET protocol’s steps on a strong local passive state,
ρ, is described by the following density matrix [32]:
ρf =
X
µ=±1
Ub(µ)Ma(µ)ρM †
a(µ)U †
b(µ),
(4)
where Ma (µ) is the measurement operator of a POVM on
A, that commutes with Hb and V, µ is the corresponding
outcome, and Ub (µ) is an informed unitary that maxi-
mizes the energy extraction depending on the outcome.
Then, the amount of energy extracted locally from B
on average is given by
−∆Eb = −Tr [(HB + V ) ρf] ≥0,
(5)
since [Ma, V ] = [Ma, Hb] = 0 and given that the expec-
tation value of each term of the Hamiltonian was set to
have a vanishing value (see appendix C3 in [39] and [32]
for detailed calculation). Note that when the measure-
ment outcome is not communicated to B (Ub independent
of µ), it is impossible to activate and extract energy on
average from B.
From eq.(5), the amount of activable energy is bounded
as 0 ≤−∆Eb ≤−λmin, where λmin is the most negative
eigenvalue of Hb + V . This upper bond is tight when
the POVMs are proportional to projective operators. In
particular, by implementing the QET protocol on the
ground state of the Hamiltonian in eq.(1), the maximum
amount of activable energy in B is given by
(−∆Eb)max = −
p
h2b + 4κ2 + hb (ha + hb) + 4κ2
q
(ha + hb)2 + 4κ2
. (6)
This particular activation can be achieved by using pro-
jection operators of observable σa
x; in this case, the
amount of energy injected into A on average will be
Ea = ha/
q
1 +
4κ2
(ha+hb)2 .
The energy injected stays
in A and is not extracted during the protocol, with
Ea ≥(−∆Eb)max. Since no energy was propagated from
A to B, the activated energy corresponds to previously
locked energy within local zero-point energy density.
Experimental implementation.– For the experi-
mental implementation, we designed an optimized fully
unitary QET protocol by introducing an auxiliary system
that mediates the measurement on A and transmits in-
formation to B. Here, the role of the measurement device
is played by an auxiliary qubit (An); and the information
encoded in the post-measurement state of An is used to
activate energy in B.
The fully unitary QET protocol consists of the follow-
ing steps implemented by Alice and Bob:
Step 1. Alice applies a joint unitary UAnA on qubits
A and An that commutes with V and Hb. Through this
interaction, An gains information about Alice’s qubit A
without raising the energy on B.
Step 2. Then, instead of classical communication, the
auxiliary qubit An itself is sent to Bob.
Step 3. Finally, Bob implements a joint unitary UBAn
on B and An to extract energy from the system by acting
locally on B.
We optimized the three steps to achieve the maximum
amount of activated energy (−∆Eb)max, given by eq.(6),
as explained below.

System setup. The experiments were performed on a
Bruker Avance III 700 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrometer.
We used 13C-labelled transcro-
tonic acid (shown in Fig. 4a) dissolved in acetone-d6 as
our sample. Carbons labeled as C1, C2 and C3 were used
as B, An and A, respectively. The whole experiment took
place at an ambient temperature of 298 K. The overview
of the experimental scheme is shown in Fig. 3.
Step 0. As a preliminary step, to prepare the system’s
initial state, we start with the NMR pseudo-pure state
|000⟩followed by a global unitary Uprep.
The unitary
Uprep required for the state in eq.(3), in a product state
with |0⟩An, consists of ﬁrst a rotation Y (θ) = e−iσyθ/2 on
qubit B, followed by a CNOT on An and B (with B as
the control), and ﬁnally a SWAP between A and An (see
Fig.3). The explicit form of Y (θ) is

The quantum gates implemented in the experiment,
shown in Fig. 3, were realized using GRAPE pulses [40],
with a slight modiﬁcation utilizing the technique de-
scribed in ref. [41], which resulted in very smooth ra-
dio frequency (RF) pulses. Moreover, all the designed
pulses had theoretical ﬁdelity of over 0.998 and were ro-
bust against small imperfections in RF power.
The expectation values of the interaction term opera-
tor −⟨XAXB⟩and B’s local hamiltonian operator ⟨ZB⟩
were measured directly in the experiments at the end of
the quantum circuit. The experimental results are shown
in Fig. 4 as a function of the coupling strength between A
and B, for hb/ha = 0.4. The amount of extracted energy
is calculated indirectly utilizing the experimental result
of the expected values ⟨ZB⟩and −⟨XAXB⟩.
The results are shown in Fig. 4. The curves for the
ideal scenario represent the outcome when the circuit is
implemented perfectly without any decoherence.
The
curves for the simulation were made using optimized
GRAPE pulses that take decoherence into account. For
the decoherence simulation, we assumed that the envi-
ronment is Markovian, the qubits relax independently,
and the dissipator commutes with the total Hamiltonian
for the discretization time of GRAPE pulses (∆t = 2µs).
These assumptions simplify the implementation of mas-
ter equations for each ∆t, the evolution under the prop-
agator of the GRAPE pulses, and the implementation of
the dissipator. All of the experimental results give energy
extraction. The discrepancy between the simulation and
the experiment is due to the decoherence assumptions
and the transfer function of the spectrometer, which im-
plements the GRAPE pulses slightly diﬀerently than as-
sumed. The error bars shown in the results refer only to
the statistical error of the experiment.
Numerical tests show that the protocol is stable under
some uncertainty in the local Hamiltonians.
To study

5
this sensitivity quantitatively, we added perturbations in
the local parts of the Hamiltonian while performing the
QET protocol that is optimized for the non-perturbed
case. In particular, we considered perturbed local Hamil-
tonians of the form hν ∝(1 + ϵ) hνσν
z + hνf(ha, hb, κ)11.
We found that if the parameter ϵ (quantifying the relative
diﬀerence between the Hamiltonian assumed to optimize
the protocol and the actual Hamiltonian of the system)
is small, ϵ ≤0.3, then the relative impact of the error in
the implementation of the protocol is neglectable.
Conclusions.– We presented the ﬁrst experimental
activation of strong local passive states and the ﬁrst ex-
perimental demonstration of a quantum energy telepor-
tation (QET) protocol proposed by Hotta in [29, 30].
Furthermore, our experiment conﬁrms for the ﬁrst time
that the presence of entanglement in a ground state al-
lows for the activation of local zero-point energy density
without energy transfer through the system to the acti-
vated point.
Speciﬁcally, we show the experimental energy extrac-
tion from a bipartite system, initially in a strong local
passive state but activated through a quantum energy
teleportation protocol consisting of local operations and
communication without energy transfer between the par-
ties. For this, we designed a fully unitary quantum en-
ergy teleportation protocol optimized to maximize the
amount of activated energy under the constraints of our
experimental setup. The experiment was carried out us-
ing nuclear magnetic resonance, demonstrating that the
control necessary for a quantum energy teleportation pro-
tocol can be achieved in realistic experimental scenarios.
Furthermore, the optimization of the fully unitary
QET protocol demonstrates that the maximum possible
amount of activated energy can only be achieved after the
measurement device and the measured subsystem gain
full mutual information between them and the measure-
ment outcome is transmitted to the target subsystem.
The QET protocol has the potential to be a valuable
tool both for our fundamental understanding of quantum
thermodynamics and for quantum technologies. On the
fundamental side, quantum energy teleportation helps
understand quantum ﬂuctuations and their role in fun-
damental scenarios, from quantum ﬁeld theory in curved
spacetimes to quantum thermodynamics: from black hole
physics [26, 34–36] to violations of energy conditions in
quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetimes [37]. On the
technological side, it has been theoretically discussed that
QET can be used to improve purity locally by exploit-
ing interaction-induced correlations in algorithmic cool-
ing protocols [12]. Another application appears in sce-
narios where strong local passivity can potentially im-
pose restrictions on thermodynamic tasks and the regime
in which some quantum machines can perform, especially
those that rely on energy exchange through local quench-
ing and/or pulses that are fast compared to the dynamics
of the system, for example in refs. [42–45]. This exper-
iment demonstrating QET for the ﬁrst time paves the
way for the experimental exploration of these protocols
in controlled quantum systems.
