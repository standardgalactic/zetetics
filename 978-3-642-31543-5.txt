Preface
This text originates from special topics lectures I gave at Michigan State University
on Symplectic Field Theory during the Fall of 2005 and the Spring of 2006 for
graduate students after their third year. The ﬁrst lecture covered compactness results,
while the second was about polyfold theory.
Symplectic Field Theory yields powerful invariants for symplectic and contact
manifolds. It is constructed using suitable moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic
curves, and it generalizes Floer Homology, Gromov–Witten theory and Contact Ho-
mology. The ﬁrst paper on Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) was the 113-page survey
by Yakov Eliashberg, Alexandre Givental and Helmut Hofer in the year 2000 [20].
As of now, a decade later, the general theory of SFT is still in development.
The concept of a polyfold was introduced by H. Hofer, K. Wysocki and E. Zehn-
der to address the numerous technical challenges in SFT in a systematic way. The
reader is referred to the articles [39–42]. As a ﬁrst application of polyfold theory
H. Hofer, K. Wysocki and E. Zehnder recently gave a complete construction of
Gromov–Witten theory in full generality [43]. Pseudoholomorphic curves are so-
lutions to a nonlinear version of the Cauchy Riemann equations. Before a solution
space of a nonlinear system of elliptic partial differential equations can be equipped
with the structure of a polyfold it is necessary to understand its compactness prop-
erties. In the case of pseudoholomorphic curves this is the subject of this lecture.
Pseudoholomorphic curves have become a useful tool in symplectic geometry,
and they were introduced by M. Gromov in his ground breaking 1985 paper [30].
Gromov’s work is based on understanding moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic
curves on compact Riemann surfaces in a compact symplectic manifold. The sub-
ject of this text is to construct and describe the compactiﬁcation relevant for SFT
by F. Bourgeois, Y. Eliashberg, H. Hofer, K. Wysocki and E. Zehnder [12], a gen-
eralization of Gromov’s result. Finally, the theory of polyfolds provides a general
analytic framework for certain spaces which admit no smooth manifold structure,
such as compactiﬁcations of spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves.
Andreas Floer was the ﬁrst to recognize the importance of pseudoholomorphic
curves on noncompact Riemann surfaces in his celebrated work on the Arnold con-
v

Preface
jecture [27] in 1988. Since then numerous different ﬂavors of Floer Homology have
been studied, and SFT is a construction in the same spirit.
Another important step consists of the work of Helmut Hofer in 1993 [33] on
the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three. The Weinstein conjecture states that
the Reeb vector ﬁeld on any closed contact manifold has a periodic orbit. The main
tool in H. Hofer’s paper are pseudoholomorphic curves on the complex plane into
the symplectization of a contact manifold M. In dimension three the Weinstein con-
jecture was proved by Clifford Taubes [67, 68] in 2007/2009 using Seiberg Witten
equations. Interestingly, the gauge theoretic and the pseudoholomorphic curve sto-
ries are closely related. This is apparent from the proof that Seiberg–Witten Floer
Homology and M. Hutching’s Embedded Contact Homology (in some sense a ver-
sion of SFT) are isomorphic (see [52, 69–73] for more information on ECH).
Hofer showed that the existence of a nonconstant pseudoholomorphic plane with
ﬁnite energy implies the existence of a periodic orbit of the Reeb vector ﬁeld, and
he proved such existence results under some additional assumptions on M (see also
[3] for other developments).
In the last decade special cases of the general Symplectic Field Theory construc-
tion and different ﬂavors of it have been established and studied, already with far
reaching applications. See [17, 18, 21–24, 44, 45, 52, 53] for a sample of the already
large number of works on the subject.
In this text we will give a proof of the compactness results in SFT as in the
paper [12], but with considerably more details and background material. We also
present a version for curves with boundary (see [16, 26] for related results). The
SFT compactness result describes what a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves
converges to (in a suitable sense), and it provides a description of the compactiﬁed
moduli space. The outcome of this compactiﬁcation procedure is the space of all
holomorphic buildings which we discuss in detail. We also present all the neces-
sary background material from hyperbolic geometry of surfaces. The purpose is to
give a uniﬁed and detailed presentation which is currently not available in the lit-
erature. Hopefully this text makes the beginnings of Symplectic Field Theory more
accessible.

Chapter 1
Riemann Surfaces
The purpose of this chapter is to provide the material necessary for understanding
convergence of Riemann surfaces in the sense of Deligne–Mumford. If we want
to discuss the convergence behavior of a sequence of J -holomorphic curves (uk)
we need to take into account that their domains are all different Riemann sur-
faces (S,jk). The aim is to establish a suitable notion of convergence for these as
well. The discussion here follows Thurston’s approach [74] utilizing hyperbolic ge-
ometry similar to C. Hummel’s proof of Gromov’s compactness theorem [46] (see
also [5, 13] and [75] as general references). The details, however, are spread out
over the literature so we give a thorough and uniﬁed presentation.
1.1 Smooth and Noded Riemann Surfaces
Deﬁnition 1.1
An atlas on a smooth surface S with charts ϕα : Uα →C,

α Uα = S is called conformal if the transition maps
ϕβ ◦ϕ−1
α
: ϕ(Uα ∩Uβ) −→ϕβ(Uα ∩Uβ)
are holomorphic. A conformal structure on S is a maximal conformal atlas.
A smooth surface S together with a conformal structure is called a Riemann surface.
A continuous map f : S →S′ between two Riemann surfaces is called holomorphic
if in local coordinates {Uα,ϕα} on S and {U′
β,ϕ′
β} on S′ the maps ϕ′
β ◦f ◦ϕ−1
α
are
holomorphic whenever they are deﬁned. A holomorphic map f : S →S′ is called
conformal if its derivative is never zero.
It is common practice to identify a coordinate patch Uα ⊂S with its image
ϕα(Uα) ⊂C suppressing the coordinate map ϕα in the notation. This makes sense
if we consider local objects and notions which are invariant under conformal maps.
For example, if f : S →R is a smooth function on a Riemann surface then we may
deﬁne ‘f is subharmonic’ by the requirement that ∂2f
∂z∂¯z ≥0. This is well-deﬁned if

for any locally deﬁned conformal map z = h(w) the map f ◦h satisﬁes ∂2(f ◦h)
∂w∂¯w ≥0.
But this follows from

≥0.
From this it is clear that the local expression ‘ ∂2f
∂z∂¯z = 1’ for example would not make
sense globally on a Riemann surface. The following statements hold (the proofs are
trivial and we leave them to the reader):
(1) Every Riemann surface is orientable.
(2) Assume S is a Riemann surface, S′ is a smooth surface and π : S′ →S is a local
diffeomorphism. Then there exists a unique conformal structure on S′ such that
π becomes holomorphic.
(3) Application: Every covering space of a Riemann surface can be made into a
Riemann surface in a canonical fashion.
(4) Let S′ be a Riemann surface, let S be a smooth surface and let π : S′ →S be
a covering. If every covering transformation Ψ : S′ →S′ is holomorphic then
there is a unique conformal structure on S such that π becomes holomorphic.
There are different ways to look at Riemann surfaces. We will elaborate on some of
them and explain why they are equivalent to Deﬁnition 1.1.
Deﬁnition 1.2 (Almost complex structure-Alternative deﬁnition of Riemann sur-
face) Let W be a differentiable manifold. An almost complex structure on M is a
smooth section j of the vector bundle Hom(T M,T M) →M, Hom(T M,T M)z =
L(TzM,TzM) such that j2(z) = −IdTzM for all z ∈M. A pair (S,j) consisting of
a smooth surface S and an almost complex structure j is called a Riemann surface.
The two notions of Riemann surface are equivalent: Assume S is a smooth sur-
face together with a conformal structure. Then we can deﬁne an almost complex
structure j on S as follows: Let z ∈S. Let ϕα : Uα →C be a coordinate chart be-
longing to the conformal structure. We deﬁne
j(z) :=

Dϕα(z)
−1 ◦i ◦Dϕα(z).
(1.1)
Show as an exercise that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the co-
ordinate chart ϕα. This procedure also works for general complex manifolds, i.e.
smooth manifolds of even dimension which admit an atlas with holomorphic coor-
dinate transition maps. The converse procedure would be constructing a conformal
structure on a manifold with a given almost complex structure j such that (1.1)
holds.
Deﬁnition 1.3 Assume that W is a manifold with an almost complex structure j. If
W admits an atlas such that the transition maps between coordinate patches are all
holomorphic, and if j is then given by (1.1) then it is called a complex structure or
an integrable almost complex structure.

1.1
Smooth and Noded Riemann Surfaces

Remark 1.4 The existence question of an almost complex structure on a given even
dimensional manifold M is rather a topological question while the existence ques-
tion of an integrable almost complex structure is of analytical nature, and it is usually
more difﬁcult to answer. For example, it is known that the only spheres admitting
almost complex structures are S2 and S6. By our remarks above every almost com-
plex structure on S2 is integrable. On the other hand, it is an open question whether
S6 admits any complex structure.
A celebrated theorem due to Newlander and Nirenberg [57] asserts that an almost
complex structure j on a manifold W is integrable if and only if the Nijenhuis tensor,
deﬁned by
N(X,Y) := [X,Y] + j[jX,Y] + j[X,jY] −[jX,jY]
vanishes for all vector ﬁelds X,Y on W. Here [·, ·] denotes the Lie bracket. If
W is 2-dimensional then the Nijenhuis tensor does vanish so that Deﬁnitions 1.1
and 1.2 are indeed equivalent. Another way of deﬁning Riemann surfaces is taken
by Lipman Bers in his lecture notes [10]. He deﬁnes a Riemann surface to be a
smooth surface together with a distinguished family of functions which he calls an-
alytic functions. His point of view is that the conformal structure determines which
functions f : S →C are holomorphic or not.
We will prove the integrability of almost complex structures on surfaces apart
from two assertions where a complete proof would lead us too far astray and which
we will address later in more detail. The higher dimensional case (the Newlander–
Nirenberg theorem) is much more difﬁcult. In order to get an idea, the reader may
look at the introduction of [76]. The integrability result is the following:
Proposition 1.5
Let J be the set of real 2 × 2 matrices j such that j2 = −Id
and {v,jv} is a positively oriented basis of R2 whenever 0 ̸= v ∈R2. Denote the
standard complex structure on R2 ≈C by i and let D := {s + it ∈C|s2 + t2 < 1}.
Assume that j : D →J is a smooth map. Then there is a diffeomorphism ψ between
suitable open neighborhoods of 0 ∈D with ψ(0) = 0, ∂sψ(0) = 1 and
dψ(s + it) ◦j(s + it) = i ◦dψ(s + it).
(1.2)
Proof Step 1: Reformulate (1.2) using the Beltrami equation.
The almost complex structure j is of the form
j =
b
−a
c
−b

where a,b,c : D →R are (smooth) functions satisfying a,c > 0, ac −b2 = 1.
Using a linear isomorphism we may assume that j(0) = i, i.e. b(0) = 0 and a(0) =
c(0) = 1. Deﬁne a complex valued function μ by
μ := c −a −2ib
a + c + 2 .
(1.3)

Riemann Surfaces
The differential equation (1.2) is equivalent to the so-called Beltrami equation
¯∂ψ = μ∂ψ,
(1.4)
where
∂ζ := 1
2(∂sζ −i∂tζ),
¯∂ζ = 1
2(∂sζ + i∂tζ).
Indeed, we compute
dψ ◦j = (b∂sψ + c∂tψ)ds −(a∂sψ + b∂tψ)dt
= i dψ
= i∂sψ ds + i∂tψ dt.
This is the same as
(b −i)∂sψ + c∂tψ = 0,
a∂sψ + (b + i)∂tψ = 0,
and these two equations are equivalent in view of ac −b2 = 1. If we expand the
Beltrami equation
(a + c + 2)¯∂ψ = (c −a −2ib)∂ψ
we arrive directly at the two above equations. If a solution ψ to the Beltrami equa-
tion (or to ψ∗j = iψ∗) satisﬁes in addition ψ(0) = 0 and ∂sψ(0) = 1 then it is a
local diffeomorphism near 0 since ∂sψ(0) and ∂tψ(0) are linear independent over
the real numbers.
Step 2: Existence of a local solution to the Beltrami equation of class C1,α.
Let D ⊂C be the closed unit disk and let 0 < α ≤1. We have the following
result:
Proposition 1.6 Let C := {η ∈C1,α(D,C)|η(eiθ) ∈Re
3
2 iθ}. The operator
¯∂: C −→Cα(D,C)
η −→∂sη + i∂tη
is a surjective Fredholm operator of index four.
The reader should consult Appendices A5 and A6 in [4] for a proof.
In fact, the kernel of the above operator consists of all polynomials of the form
η(z) = a0 + a1z + ¯a1z2 + ¯a0z3. Then the following operator is a Banach space
isomorphism:
T : C −→Cα(D,C) × C × C
T η :=
¯∂η,η(0),∂sη(0)

.

Smooth and Noded Riemann Surfaces

We deﬁne now the following smooth map:
Φ : Cα(D,C) × Cα(D,C) −→Cα(D,C) × Cα(D,C)
Φ(f,μ) :=

f −μ

∂

T −1(f,0,1)

,μ

.
We are done with step 2 if we can ﬁnd a solution (f,μ) to the equation
Φ(f,μ) = (0,μ).
Indeed, assume there is such a solution. Then
f = μ

∂

T −1(f,0,1)

and ψ := T −1(f,0,1) satisﬁes
¯∂ψ = f,
ψ(0) = 0,
∂sψ(0) = 1
so that
¯∂ψ = μ∂ψ,
ψ(0) = 0,
∂sψ(0) = 1.
We compute the derivative of Φ at (0,0):
DΦ(0,0)(h,λ) =

h −λ

∂

T −1(0,0,1)

,λ

.
Write τ = T −1(0,0,1) = z + z2 and recall the above characterization of the kernel
of the Cauchy Riemann operator on the space C. We must have a0 = 0 in view of
τ(0) = 0, hence τ = a1z + ¯a1z2. Then 1 = ∂sτ(0) = ∂τ(0) = a1 leads to τ(z) =
z + z2 and ∂τ = 1 + 2z. Hence

DΦ(0,0)(h,λ)

(z) =

h(z) −λ(z)(1 + 2z),λ(z)

which has a bounded inverse

DΦ(0,0)−1(g,κ)

(z) =

g(z) + κ(z)(1 + 2z),κ(z)

.
By the inverse function theorem, the map Φ is a diffeomorphism between suitable
open neighborhoods Uα,Vα of (0,0) ∈Cα(D,C) × Cα(D,C). Let β : D →[0,1]
be a smooth function such that β(z) ≡1 for |z| ≤1/4 and β(z) ≡0 if |z| ≥1/2. If
ε ∈(0,1] we deﬁne
με(z) := μ(z)β

which amounts to a C1-bound on the functions με independent of ε. Then
∥με∥Cα(D) →0 as ε →0 (show this as an exercise!). Then (0,με) ∈Vα if ε is
sufﬁciently small. Let (f,ν) := Φ−1(0,με). Then ν = με, and ψ := T −1(f,0,1)
solves the desired equation on a sufﬁciently small disk centered at the origin.
Step 3 (Sketch only): Regularity, i.e. if μ smooth then so is the solution to the
Beltrami equation.
Let ψ be the function of class C1,α constructed in step 2. Because its deriva-
tive is nonsingular in the origin it is a local C1-diffeomorphism between suitable
neighborhoods U,V ⊂C of 0. Let ϕ be its inverse, so that
dϕ(z) + j

ϕ(z)

◦dϕ(z) ◦i = 0,
in other words, ϕ is a j-holomorphic curve. By regularity of j-holomorphic curves,
if ϕ and j are of class W k,p then u is actually of class W k+1,p. In particular, if j
is smooth then so is ϕ and also ψ. We will not address the topic of regularity of
pseudoholomorphic curves. The interested reader may consult Appendix A4 in [4]
or [50].
□
The Beltrami equation is closely related to the following result:
Proposition 1.7 (Existence of isothermal parameters on a surface)
Let S be an
oriented surface with orientation form σ and a (smooth) Riemannian metric g. Then
for any point p ∈S there is a local coordinate chart φ : U(p) →R2 such that
ψ∗(ds ∧dt) = f σ for some positive function f (i.e. ψ is orientation preserving)
and ψ∗(ds2 + dt2) = hg, where h is also a positive functions.
Proof If we write out the metric g in arbitrary local coordinates as E ds2 +
2F ds dt + Gdt2 with E,G > 0 and EG −F 2 > 0 then we can deﬁne a (local)
almost complex structure by
jg =
1
√
EG −F 2
−F
−G
E
F

(which corresponds to rotation by 90◦in the tangent planes). This is globally deﬁned
if the underlying surface is oriented. If we choose now local coordinates so that jg
is transformed to the standard structure i then in these coordinates the metric g
transforms to one which differs from the Euclidean metric by multiplication with a
positive function (we say ‘conformal to the Euclidean metric’).
□
We summarize our previous discussion:
A conformal structure on a surface induces an almost complex structure in a
natural way via (1.1). On the other hand, if S is a surface endowed with an almost
complex structure j then there is a conformal structure on S which induces j.

1.1
Smooth and Noded Riemann Surfaces
7
If g is a Riemannian metric on an oriented surface S then there is a canonical
almost complex structure jg on S, which just rotates vectors in each tangent plane
by 90◦. Using the result about isothermal parameters we can ﬁnd a conformal struc-
ture on S, and the metric g is conformal to the Euclidean metric in these coordinates.
The almost complex structure induced by the conformal structure coincides with jg.
If g,h are two Riemannian metrics on S then the induced almost complex structures
jg and jh are equal if and only if g and h are conformal, i.e. if there is a positive
function λ such that h = λg.
A priori there is no distinguished metric g which induces a given complex struc-
ture j. We will later deﬁne the concept of a stable surface (which includes most
surfaces) where complex structures are in 1:1 correspondence with complete Rie-
mannian metrics with constant sectional curvature −1. We will call such a metric
the Poincaré metric of the corresponding Riemann surface. The advantage of this
viewpoint is that the class of these metrics on a given surface S can be understood
geometrically while this is not so clear for the set of all complex structures.
Proposition 1.7 goes back to Carl Friedrich Gauss (1820s) if the metric g is real
analytic (see [65] for Gauss’ argument), to Korn and Lichtenstein (1914, 1916) for
metrics of class C1,α and Morrey, Bers, Ahlfors (1938, [8] 1960) for g merely of
class L∞in which case the coordinate change is of class W 1,p for some p > 2. For
a classical proof of the Korn–Lichtenstein result see [15] and [65]. The Beltrami
equation is reformulated as an integral equation. After proving some estimates a
solution operator to the Beltrami equation can then be constructed. The proof in
the L∞case is in the same spirit and uses the usual techniques for proving Lp
estimates (see [8]). Our proof was taken from [50] because it is more in tune with
the topics covered in this lecture. After having looked at Riemann surfaces from
different angles, let us close this section with a brief overview of the topics ahead
of us.
We are interested in the Riemann moduli space Mg of equivalence classes of
closed Riemann surfaces of genus g ≥2 and other related moduli spaces (surfaces
with boundary, with points removed etc.). We want to regard two Riemann surfaces
(S,j) and (S′,j′) as equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism φ : S →S′ such that
φ∗j = j′φ∗. Let J (S) be the set of all complex structures on a ﬁxed smooth closed
surface S of genus g ≥2. The group of all diffeomorphisms Diff(S) of S acts on
J (S) via j →(φ−1)∗◦j ◦φ∗. Then Mg can be identiﬁed with
J (S)/Diff(S).
Dividing by the connected component of the identity map Diff0(S) ⊂Diff(S) yields
the so-called Teichmüller space. We will deﬁne a slightly larger space Mg which
will serve as a compactiﬁcation of the space Mg. The additional objects in Mg
are the so-called noded Riemann surfaces. We will deﬁne a suitable notion of con-
vergence (‘Deligne–Mumford convergence’) such that every sequence in Mg has a
convergent subsequence. This is the statement of the Deligne–Mumford compact-
ness result. The space Mg can actually be equipped with a metric such that DM-
convergence is the same as convergence with respect to this metric, and the comple-
tion of Mg is Mg, but we will not pursue this topic at the moment. We also point

out that we are not dealing with any kind of issues regarding smooth structure on
the compactiﬁed Riemann space. In fact, the space Mg carries an orbifold structure
for g ≥2 (see [62]). We will largely follow the notation of the paper [12]. The proof
of the Deligne–Mumford compactness result will follow the presentation in [46].
Deﬁnition 1.8
Let (S,j) be a Riemann surface. A marking of the surface S is a
ﬁnite sequence of points (x1,...,xn), xj ∈S. We use the notation M = (x1,...,xn).
If a marking (x1,...,xn) is given then we call S = (S,j,M) a Riemann surface with
marked points.
Note that the ordering of the points x1,...,xn is part of the structure (unless
we say otherwise). We now deﬁne the objects which need to be added in order to
compactify the Riemann moduli space.
Consider a (possibly disconnected) Riemann surface S = (S,j,M,D) with
marked points M ∪D so that M ∩D = ∅. The points in the set D are called special
marked points or nodal points because they have the following additional features:
The set D consists of an even number of points which are organized in pairs
D = {d1,d1,...,dk,dk}.
As for the marked points in M the ordering of the points is part of the structure,
i.e. merely exchanging the order of two marked points in M yields a Riemann sur-
face which we consider different from the original one. The above notation sug-
gests that in the set D we are not interested in the particular ordering of the pairs
(d1,d1),...,(dk,dk). Moreover we will also identify (dj,dj) with (dj,dj). This
ordering convention is the one from the article [12]. A priori other choices are pos-
sible.
Deﬁnition 1.9
We call a Riemann surface (S,j,M,D) with marked points M =
(x1,...,xn) and special marked points D = {d1,d1,...,dk,dk} a noded Riemann
surface. Two noded Riemann surfaces S = (S,j,M,D) and S′ = (S′,j′,M′,D′)
with M = (x1,...,xn) and M′ = (x′
1,...,x′
n) are called (conformally) equivalent
if there is a diffeomorphism ϕ : S →S′ such that ϕ∗j = j′ϕ∗, ϕ(xj) = x′
j for all
1 ≤j ≤n and ϕ(D) = D′ mapping pairs to pairs.
We use the notation S = [S,j,M,D] if we refer to the equivalence class of
a noded Riemann surface (S,j,M,D). Sometimes we will also call [S,j,M,D]
a noded Riemann surface.
We can associate to a noded Riemann surface a singular surface as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.10 Let S be a noded Riemann surface. We deﬁne
ˆSD := S/{dj ∼dj |1 ≤j ≤k}
and we call ˆSD the singular surface associated to S. We call the noded surface
S connected if its singular surface is. If S is connected we deﬁne its arithmetic

where C is the number of connected components of the surface S and g1,...,gC
are the genera of the connected components of S. If S is a noded Riemann surface
with arithmetic genus g and μ := #M then the pair (g,μ) is called the signature
of S.
Example 1.11 If S is closed and connected, and if D = ∅then the arithmetic genus
coincides with the genus of S. If S is the 2-torus with a pair of nodal points then
g = 2. The meaning of the arithmetic genus comes from the notion of convergence
in the sense of Deligne and Mumford. It allows in a sequence of Riemann sur-
faces for closed curves to shrink to a point, creating a noded Riemann surface (see
Fig. 1.1).
We will deﬁne an additional structure for noded Riemann surfaces, the notion of
a decorated node.
Deﬁnition 1.12 (Decorated noded Riemann surface)
Let S = (S,j,M,D) be a
noded Riemann surface. We say S is decorated if every pair {dj,dj} in D carries
the following additional structure: A map
rj : Γ j :=

satisfying rj(eiθz) = e−iθrj(z) for all z ∈Γ j (see Fig. 1.2).
An equivalence between decorated noded Riemann surfaces has to preserve the
decoration maps rj. We introduce the following notation for spaces of Riemann

(1.5)
Usually, we will also require that the surfaces are stable which means that for each
connected component twice the genus plus the number of marked points is greater
than two (more on this later). Assume S = (S,j,M,D) is a noded Riemann surface.
We deﬁne a new surface SD, called the blow-up of S as follows: We remove all
the points {dj,dj} from S, then we compactify the resulting surface by adding the
circles Γ j, Γ j deﬁned above. Then there is the canonical projection π : SD →S
which collapses the boundary circles Γ j, Γ j to the corresponding points dj, dj.
The projection π induces a conformal structure on the interior of SD which, how-
ever, degenerates along the boundary circles Γ j, Γ j.
If S comes with a decoration (in which case we write (S,r)) we can glue the
circles Γ j, Γ j together with the decoration maps rj, and we obtain a closed sur-
face SD,r. The genus of SD,r then equals the arithmetic genus of S, and we obtain
a canonical projection p : SD,r →ˆSD collapsing the circle Γj = {Γ j,Γ j} to the
double point dj = {dj,dj}. The projection p also induces a conformal structure on
SD,r with the special circles Γj removed. The surface SD,r is called the deformation
of the noded decorated surface (S,r).

1.1
Smooth and Noded Riemann Surfaces
11
The reason why we are introducing noded surfaces is that they are needed to
compactify the moduli space of smooth Riemann surfaces. The main result of this
chapter is the following:
Theorem Assume Sn = (Sn,jn,Mn) is a sequence of smooth marked stable Rie-
mann surfaces of signature (g,μ). Then (Sn)n∈N has a subsequence which con-
verges to a stable decorated noded Riemann surface S = (S,j,M,D,r) of signa-
ture (g,μ).
At this point we have not introduced the notion of convergence of a sequence of
Riemann surfaces yet, but we will do so later in this chapter. For stable surfaces,
complex structures correspond to complete metrics with sectional curvature −1
(Poincaré metrics). We will present a proof of this fact in the next two sections
of this chapter. We will also show that every such surface is isometric to a simple
model (pair of pants decomposition, Bers’ theorem). A sequence of smooth surfaces
will converge to a non-smooth noded surface if the Poincaré metrics degenerate in
the limit along a ﬁnite union of closed curves. As we will show, after allowing
reparametrizations of the surfaces, this is the only phenomenon preventing conver-
gence of the metrics. This requires a detailed study of the degeneration process
which in turn requires quite a bit of (elementary) hyperbolic geometry.
Theorem 1.13 (Uniformization theorem for simply connected Riemann surfaces)
Let (S,j) be a simply connected Riemann surface without boundary. Then (S,j) is
conformally equivalent to exactly one of the following Riemann surfaces:
(1) The complex plane C,
(2) The upper half plane H + = {z ∈C|Im(z) > 0},
(3) The Riemann sphere S2 = C ∪{∞}.
By conformal equivalence we mean for example in case (1) the existence of a
diffeomorphism ψ : S →C such that ψ∗j = iψ∗. The proof of the theorem would
take too much time for this lecture, good references are [6, 10].
From the above theorem one can derive the following result (see [6]):
Theorem 1.14 (Uniformization theorem)
If S is a connected Riemann surface
without boundary then S is conformally equivalent to either
(1) C,
(2) C\{0},
(3) C/L, where L is a lattice,
(4) CP 1 = S2 = C ∪{∞},
(5) H +/G, where H + = {z ∈C|Im(z) > 0} and G is a group of conformal maps
of H + acting freely and properly discontinuously.
Proof (Assuming the uniformization theorem for simply connected surfaces) Let
S be a connected Riemann surface without boundary. Let p : ˆS →S be its universal

covering, and let G ≈π1(S) be the group of covering transformations, i.e.
G = {g : ˆS →ˆS |g is conformal and p ◦g = p}
so that S ≈ˆS/G ( ˆS carries the conformal structure induced by S which makes
all covering transformations conformal, ‘≈’ means ‘conformally equivalent’). The
group G acts freely and properly discontinuously. Acting freely means that apart
from the identity map, all g ∈G are ﬁxed point free. Acting properly discontin-
uously means that every point x has a neighborhood U such that the set {g ∈
G|g(U)∩U ̸= ∅} is ﬁnite. By Theorem 1.13 there are only three possibilities for ˆS.
If ˆS is conformally equivalent to the 2-sphere then we use the fact that the group of
all conformal transformations of S2 is given by

.
Since all of them have ﬁxed points we conclude that the group of covering transfor-
mations is trivial and S is conformally equivalent to the 2-sphere as well. If ˆS ≈C
then G is a properly discontinuous group of parallel translations. There are three of
them
(1) G = {Id} so that S = C,
(2) G is the inﬁnite cyclic group generated by z →z + b for some b ̸= 0 so that
S is an inﬁnite cylinder conformally equivalent to the punctured plane,
(3) G is the abelian group generated by two translations z →z+b1 and z →z+b2
where b1/b2 /∈R so that S is a torus.
In all the other cases, S is a quotient of the hyperbolic plane.
□
The following result is a special case of the so-called Hopf–Killing theorem, the
Riemannian geometry version of the uniformization theorem (see [28], Chap. 3.F
for the proof):
Theorem 1.15 Let S be a simply connected surface without boundary with a com-
plete Riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature K = −1. Then S is isomet-
ric to H + := {z = x + iy ∈C|Im(z) > 0} with the metric gH + = y−2(dx2 + dy2).
In the case K = 0 the surface S is isometric to C with the Euclidean metric, and
in the case K = +1 it is the 2-sphere with the usual metric. We will not need these
cases here, nor do we need the corresponding statements in dimensions greater than
two. The following proposition follows from the proof of Theorem 1.15 in [28], and
it is a local version of the theorem:
Proposition 1.16
Let S be a surface of sectional curvature −1. If ∂S ̸= ∅then
assume that all components of the boundary are closed geodesics. Then every point
in S\∂S has an open neighborhood which is isometric to an open subset of H +.
Every point q ∈∂S has an open neighborhood which is isometric to a set of the
form U ∩{z ∈H + |Re(z) ≥0} where U ⊂H + is some open neighborhood of i.

1.2 Riemann Surfaces and Hyperbolic Geometry
1.2.1 Stable Surfaces
Let S be a smooth oriented surface. In this section, S may have several connected
components or ∂S ̸= ∅as well.
Deﬁnition 1.17 A ﬁnite extension of S is a smooth orientation preserving embed-
ding i : S →Σ into a compact oriented surface Σ such that Σ\i(S) is a ﬁnite set.
The elements in the set Σ\i(S) are called punctures of S. If S1,...,Sn are the con-
nected components of S, and if Σ1,...,Σn are the corresponding components of a
ﬁnite extension Σ then let gj be the genus of Σj, let mj be the number of bound-
ary components of Σj, and let nj be the number of points in Σj\i(Sj). The list
{(gj,mj,nj)}1≤j≤n is called the signature of S. We say that S is stable if for each
1 ≤j ≤n we have
nj > χ(Σj) = 2 −2gj −mj
(i.e. at least three puncture points if Σj is a 2-sphere, at least two on a disk, at least
one on an annulus or a torus) or
2gj + mj + nj ≥3.
Remark 1.18 Noded and marked Riemann surfaces ﬁt into this picture if we inter-
pret the marked and nodal points as punctures. Then Σ would be the original surface
and S would be Σ\(M ∪D). A noded Riemann surface S = (S,j,M,D) is stable
if and only if the automorphism group of each connected component is ﬁnite, i.e.
#

φ ∈Diff(Sj)|φ∗j = jφ∗, φ(x) = x ∀x ∈Mj, φ(Dj) = Dj

< ∞.
For example in the case of the two sphere, all biholomorphic maps φ : S2 →S2,
S2 = C ∪{∞} are the Möbius transformations
φ(z) = az + b
cz + d ,
a,b,c,d ∈C, ad −bc ̸= 0.
In this case a direct calculation shows that the automorphism group becomes ﬁnite
if we demand that a set of at least three points is left invariant. If we consider three
marked points M = (0,1,∞) then the automorphism group consists of the identity
map only because the set of marked points is ordered and each automorphism φ has
to satisfy φ(1) = 1,φ(0) = 0 and φ(∞) = ∞. If we declare ∞a marked point and
{0,1} nodal points then the automorphism group has exactly two elements, namely
the identity map and φ(z) = 1−z. As for compact Riemann surfaces of genus g ≥2
much more is known: The number of all orientation preserving automorphisms can-
not exceed 84(g −1). This result is due to Adolf Hurwitz (1888), and it is known as
Hurwitz’s automorphism theorem [47].

Riemann Surfaces
Deﬁnition 1.19 (Hyperbolic metric) A hyperbolic metric on a smooth oriented sur-
face S is a complete Riemann metric of constant sectional curvature −1 such that
each boundary component is a closed geodesic. Such a surface together with a hy-
perbolic metric is also called a hyperbolic surface. A ﬁnite extension of a complex
structure j on S is a ﬁnite extension i : S →Σ such that i∗j extends to a complex
structure on Σ. We say j is of ﬁnite type if it admits a ﬁnite extension.
We mention a few facts about complete Riemannian manifolds (see [54],
Chap. 10 or [28]): First,we recall that a Riemannian manifold W is called (geodesi-
cally) complete if every geodesic can be extended to the whole real line. This is
equivalent to the fact that for any point p ∈W the exponential map expp is deﬁned
on all of TpW. If we deﬁne for p,q ∈W


then (W,ϱ) is a metric space, and the metric ϱ induces the usual topology on W.
Geodesic completeness of W is equivalent to completeness of (W,ϱ) as a metric
space.1 If W is complete then the Hopf–Rinow theorem asserts that any two points
in a connected component can be joined by a minimal geodesic. We remark that a
minimal geodesic joining two points is in general not unique (take for example two
antipodal points on the 2-sphere). Moreover, the property that any two points can be
joined by a minimal geodesic does not imply completeness.
Theorem 1.20 (Existence and Uniqueness of a hyperbolic metric) Let S be a stable
oriented surface. Then S admits a hyperbolic metric such that ∂S (if nonempty) is a
union of closed geodesics. Moreover, the operation which assigns to each hyperbolic
metric on S its corresponding complex structure (rotation by 90◦in the tangent
planes) is bijective. It restricts to a bijection between hyperbolic metrics of ﬁnite
area and complex structures of ﬁnite type.
Deﬁnition 1.21 If j is a complex structure of ﬁnite type then the corresponding
hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite area is called the Poincaré metric of (S,j).
We will prove Theorem 1.20 later on in the lecture. It implies that in the case of a
stable surface S we may identify the space of all complex structures (of ﬁnite type)
on S with the space of all hyperbolic metrics (with ﬁnite area) on S, both modulo
orientation preserving diffeomorphisms. It will turn out that this point of view will
be the most useful for us. The following lemma will be helpful for the proof of
Theorem 1.20:
1If ∂W ̸= ∅then these two notions of completeness are not equivalent anymore (consider for
example the closed unit disk in R2 with the Euclidean metric). In this case we say that W is
complete if (W,ϱ) is complete as a metric space.

Lemma 1.22
Let (S,j) be an oriented Riemann surface without boundary, and
let h1,h2 be two complete Riemannian metrics on S with constant sectional curva-
ture −1 such that they both induce the complex structure j (i.e. j rotates vectors in
each tangent plane by 90◦with respect to either metric). Then h1 ≡h2.
Proof Let π : ˆS →S be the universal cover of S, and denote the induced metrics on
ˆS by ˆh1 and ˆh2 which are also complete metrics on ˆS of constant sectional curva-
ture −1. By Theorem 1.15 both ( ˆS, ˆh1) and ( ˆS, ˆh2) are isometric to the hyperbolic
plane. Composing these isometries with π we obtain covering maps
π1 :

H +,gH +
→(S,h1)
and
π2 :

H +,gH +
→(S,h2)
which are local isometries. They are also holomorphic with respect to the complex
structure j on S and the standard complex structure i on H + (recall that j is induced
by h1,h2. Then the complex structure on H + which makes π1,π2 holomorphic is
the one induced by gH + which is the standard one). Let
ς : (S,h1) →(S,h2),
ς(x) := x
which is holomorphic. We claim that ς is an isometry as well. Indeed, let p ∈S and
p1 ∈π−1

1.2.2 The Hyperbolic Plane
In order to understand hyperbolic metrics on Riemann surfaces we need some
facts from elementary hyperbolic geometry ﬁrst. We start by discussing the hy-
perbolic plane (following [28, 46, 74]). Consider the upper half plane H + :=
{z ∈C|Im(z) > 0} with the metric gH +(z) := (Im(z))−2geucl where geucl is the
Euclidean metric. The space (H +,gH +) is called the upper half plane model of the
hyperbolic plane. We will investigate its properties. We ﬁrst make some comments
about the term ‘upper half plane model’.
We consider on R3 the quadratic form
q(x0,x1,x2) := −x2
0 + x2
1 + x2
2.
Then the hyperbolic plane is deﬁned by (Fig. 1.4)
H 2 :=

The above deﬁnition is also called the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane.
There are different ways to represent H 2. Not surprisingly, one of them will be
the upper half plane model. Let s = (−1,0,0) and deﬁne a diffeomorphism

conformal if there exists a smooth function f : W →W with f (x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈W
such that g1 = fg0.
Proposition 1.24 Let W be a smooth manifold with two conformal metrics g0,g1.
Then the angle α between any two tangent vectors 0 ̸= v, w ∈TpW is the same for
each of the two metrics.
Proof This is a trivial consequence of
cosα = g1(v,w)

|v|g1 :=

g1(v,v).
□
Remark 1.25 The metrics in the disk and the upper half plane models of the hy-
perbolic plane are both conformal to the Euclidean metric. This makes these two
models convenient for drawing pictures: First D and H + are planar domains and
secondly, angle measurements in the metrics gD,gH + coincide with angle measure-
ments in the Euclidean metric.
We will now investigate some of the properties of the hyperbolic plane H =
(H +,gH +).

|ζ| = |ζ ′| = 1 then there is φ ∈Conf(H) such that p′ = φ(p) and ζ ′ = Dφ(p)ζ.
All φ ∈Conf(H) which satisfy φ(i) = i are of the form
φ(z) = az −b
bz + a
where a,b ∈R,
a2 + b2 = 1,
and with a + ib = eiθ we have
Dφ(i)ζ = e−2iθζ.
The claim then follows because there are also φ,φ′ ∈Conf(H) with φ(p) = i and
φ′(p′) = i.
We continue with the proof of the proposition. If ψ ∈I then for any p ∈H
its differential is uniquely determined by its value Dψ(p)ζ on any vector

(Dψ(p)ζ,Dψ(p)(iζ)) is positively oriented, hence Dψ(p)(iζ) = iDψ(p)ζ.
Moreover, we have for all p ∈H and ζ ∈TpH

For later reference, we summarize the following fact which we proved above:
Lemma 1.27 The set of conformal isomorphisms Conf(H) acts transitively on the
unit sphere bundle of T H, i.e. given ζ ∈TpH and ζ ′ ∈Tp′H with |ζ| = |ζ ′| = 1 then
there is φ ∈Conf(H) such that p′ = φ(p) and ζ ′ = Dφ(p)ζ.
Lemma 1.28
Every ﬁxed point free orientation preserving isometry φ ∈
Conf(H) = I is conjugate to exactly one of the following isometries:
(1) The isometry P(z) = z + 1 or its inverse P −1,

a ﬁxed point in H if and only if the corresponding matrix Aφ ∈SL(R2) sat-

Proposition 1.30 (Sectional curvature and geodesics in the hyperbolic plane)
• The unparametrized geodesics of H are the rays x + iR+, x ∈R parallel to
the imaginary axis and the half circles with center on the real axis, i.e. the sets
{x + reiθ |0 < θ < π}, where x ∈R and r > 0.
• The sectional curvature of H equals −1.
Proof We write H + := {z = x + iy ∈C|y > 0} and we recall the metric

hence γ (R+) is a half-circle in H centered at the origin with radius 2|ab|. Trans-
lations parallel to the real axis are also isometries, hence all rays x0 + iR+ and all
half-circles with center on the real axis are among the unparameterized geodesics.
These are indeed all geodesics since every vector v ∈TpH is tangent to one of these
curves.
□
The following proposition is clear given the above characterization of the
geodesics in H:
Proposition 1.31
• There is a unique geodesic passing through any two distinct points.
• If γ is a geodesic and p is a point not on γ then there is a unique geodesic through
p perpendicular to γ .
• If γ1, γ2 are geodesics with positive distance then there exists a unique geodesic
perpendicular to γ1 and γ2 (the length of this geodesic equals the distance be-
tween γ1 and γ2).
Here ‘unique’ means unique up to parametrization.
Proposition 1.32 (Exponential map and distance)
(1) For every point p ∈H the exponential map expp : TpH →H is a diffeomor-
phism. In particular, the metric gH + is a complete metric.
(2) The distance function on H is given by the equation
sinh
d(p,q)


=
|p −q|
2√Im(q)Im(p),
q,p ∈H.
Sketch of proof (ﬁll in the details as an exercise)
(1) (a) Verify that it sufﬁces to show that expp is a diffeomorphism for a particular
choice of p, for example p = i, using the fact that the isometry group of H
is transitive.
(b) We want to show that expi : TiH →H is a diffeomorphism. The aim is to
derive an explicit formula for the map z →expi z. Proceed as follows: The
path δ(t) = iet is a geodesic in H parameterized by arc length. Then all
geodesics starting at the point i with unit speed are given by
γ (t) := aiet −b
biet + a
where t,a,b ∈R, a2 + b2 = 1.

1.2

(c) Passing to the disk model of the hyperbolic plane show that all geodesics
starting at the origin with unit speed are given by t →z0 tanh t
2 where
|z0| = 1, hence
expi z = z
|z| tanh
 1

which is a diffeomorphism from C ≈T0D to D.
(2) Since δ(t) is a geodesic parametrized by arc length we have d(i,iet) = t. The
distance formula delivers the same result for p = i, q = iet. If q,p ∈H are
arbitrary points there is an isometry φ such that q = φ(iet) and p = φ(i). Then
show that the right hand side of the distance formula is invariant under the action
of the isometry group.
Using the formula (1.6) for the sectional curvature, we will prove a special case of
Theorem 1.20, namely the case of a closed surface. The general case will be proved
following a different more geometric strategy. This proof has been included in the
lecture because the argument’s analytic nature contrasts the rest of this section, and
it does not require the curvature to be constant.
□
Theorem 1.33 (Poincaré metric for closed surfaces) Let S be a compact oriented
surface without boundary and with genus g ≥2. Then S admits a hyperbolic met-
ric. Moreover, the operation which assigns to each hyperbolic metric on S its cor-
responding complex structure (rotation by 90◦in the tangent planes) is bijective.
Proof We ﬁrst show that if h1, h2 are two metrics on a compact surface S with the
same nonpositive sectional curvature κ, κ ̸≡0, so that h2 = λh1 for some smooth
positive function λ on S then h1 ≡h2. The function λ has an absolute maximum x0
and an absolute minimum x1. If we pass into isothermal local coordinates for the
metric h1 then we may assume that h1 = fgeucl where f is a positive function and
where geucl is the Euclidean metric on R2. We conclude from (1.6) that
(logf ) = −2κf,


log(f λ)

= −2κλf.
Writing λ = eβ and f = eα we obtain
α = −2κeα,
α + β = −2κeα+β
which we combine to
β = −2κeα
eβ −1

.
We remark that β is globally deﬁned while α is not. Moreover, if β happens to
be constant then it must be zero. After choosing isothermal coordinates near the
maximum x0 of β, assume that β(x0) > 0. Then eβ(x0) −1 > 0 and also eβ −1 > 0
on a sufﬁciently small ball B centered at x0. Since κ ≤0 we obtain β ≥0 on B.
The maximum principle [29] implies now that the function β cannot have an interior

24

Riemann Surfaces
maximum on B unless it is constant. Because x0 was an absolute maximum for β
we get β|B ≡β(x0). The set

x0 ∈S |β(x0) = sup
z∈S
β(z) > 0

is closed and also open by our reasoning above. Hence it is empty or all of S.
It cannot be all of S since β ≡const. implies β ≡0. Therefore, β(z) ≤0 for all
z ∈S.
If we choose isothermal coordinates near the minimum x1, and if we assume
that β(x1) < 0 then we get β ≤0 on a sufﬁciently small ball B centered at x1.
This time the maximum principle prohibits β from having an interior minimum on
B unless it is constant. As above this shows that our initial assumption β(x1) < 0
cannot hold, so that β(z) ≥0 for all z ∈S. Summarizing, we get β ≡0 and λ ≡1
so that the two metrics are indeed equal as claimed.
As a consequence, if two metrics with constant sectional curvature −1 on a com-
pact surface induce the same complex structure they must be equal since they are
conformal.
Let j be a complex structure on S. By the uniformization theorem (Theo-
rem 1.14) the universal covering space of S is the upper half plane with the stan-
dard complex structure i, and (S,j) is conformally isomorphic to (H +/G,i) where
G = G(j) is a group consisting of isometries of H (Proposition 1.26). Therefore the
hyperbolic metric gH + on H descends to a metric h on the quotient, and the covering
projection (H +,gH +) →(S,h) becomes a local isometry. The complex structure on
H + associated to the metric gH + is just the standard structure i. Then the complex
structure associated to h is j, and h is also a complete metric of constant sectional
curvature −1. This shows that every complex structure on S is induced by some
hyperbolic metric.

φ(z) = (az + b)/(cz + d) with

1.2.3 Gluing Hyperbolic Surfaces Along Their Boundaries
By Proposition 1.16 a neighborhood of a boundary point of a hyperbolic sur-
face with geodesic boundary is isometric to a corresponding neighborhood of i in
H ∩{z ∈C|Re(z) ≥0}. If we combine this with the above formula for the metric in
Fermi coordinates, we obtain the following gluing lemma (see also remarks below):
Lemma 1.35
Let S1,S2 be surfaces with hyperbolic metrics h1,h2, and let them
have boundary curves γk : S1 = R/Z →Sk, k = 1,2 which are geodesic with re-
spect to the metrics h1 and h2, respectively, so that their lengths ℓare equal. In the
case where S1 = S2 we assume that γ1 and γ2 are distinct and that they have the
same boundary orientation. If α ∈R then we deﬁne a new surface ˆS by
ˆS := S1 ∪S2/

γ1(t) ∼γ2(α −t)

.
The surface ˆS then carries a hyperbolic metric which equals hk when restricted
to Sk, k = 1,2.
Deﬁnition 1.36 The pair (ℓ,α) ∈R+ ⊗R is called the gluing data, and α is called
the twist parameter of the gluing data (ℓ,α).
Remark 1.37 The twist parameter is in R and not in S1. Twist parameters which
differ by an integer yield isometric surfaces. Thurston [74] compares it with ‘how
many times the leg of the pajama suit is twisted before it ﬁts onto the baby’s foot.’
In Teichmüller theory two hyperbolic surfaces are considered equivalent if they are
diffeomorphic by a diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity. Riemann moduli space,
however, consists of hyperbolic surfaces modulo diffeomorphism. So in the latter
case it does not make a difference whether the pajama is worn twisted or not. In these
notes we are dealing with the Riemann moduli space, not with Teichmüller space.
Similarly, if G1,G2 ⊂H are two regions with piecewise geodesic bound-
aries then G1 and G2 can be glued together along boundary geodesic arcs

c1,c2 : [0,1] →H of equal length by identifying c1(t) with c2(t). We will now
deﬁne the double of a hyperbolic surface. Assume that S is a surface equipped
with a hyperbolic metric h such that all components of ∂S are geodesics. Let S′
be another copy of S (equipped with the same metric h), and let ι : S →S′ be the
map3 x →x. We deﬁne the doubled surface Sd by

Let ϕα : S ⊃Uα →B+
r (i) ⊂H + be a local coordinate chart near a boundary point
x where B+
r (i) := {z ∈H + |Re(z) ≥0, |z −i| < r}. By the local version of The-
orem 1.15 we can assume that ϕα is an isometry if we equip H + with the usual
hyperbolic metric. Let
C : H + →H +,
C(z) = −¯z
which is an orientation reversing isometry. We deﬁne now a chart near the point
ι(x) ∈S′ by

In general, this is not a smooth map, but it is if f is holomorphic. In our case, f is
a local isometry. If we choose an orientation σ on S, the opposite orientation on S′
so that f is orientation preserving then it is also holomorphic (see below exercise).
Exercise 1.38 (Local isometries of H are global isometries) Let U ⊂H + be an
open subset and assume that f : U →H + is of class C1, preserves orientation and
is a local isometry. Then f is a global isometry (and biholomorphic). Hints:

3More formally, we identify S with S × {0} and we let S′ := S × {1}. Then ι : S →S′ is given by
ι(x,0) = (x,1).

(2) Composing with an element in Conf(H) we may assume that

(3) Show that all derivatives of f at the point i of order ≥2 must vanish and con-
clude that f ∈Conf(H).
The map ι : S →S′, ι(x) = x′ yields an antiholomorphic isometry ι : Sd →Sd
on the doubled surface which is also an involution, i.e. ι2 = Id. The ﬁxed point set
of ι is p(∂S).
The following example shows that gluing hyperbolic surfaces along geodesic
boundary curves does not always yield a hyperbolic surface:
Example 1.39
This example is from [13]. Consider the following two geodesics
in H :
γk(t) = k + iet,
t ∈R, k = 1,2.
The closed strip S between them is a hyperbolic surface. We have γ1(R) ∩
γ2(R) = ∅, but d(γ1(t),γ2(t)) →0 as t →∞, hence the sets γ1(R) and γ2(R) have
distance zero. We now glue the two boundary components together using the isome-
try φ(z) = 2z, i.e. we identify γ1(t) with φ(γ1(t)) = γ2(t +log2). The resulting sur-
face ˆS is topologically a cylinder, and it carries a metric with sectional curvature −1,
but this metric is not complete: Consider the following sequences of points:
an = 1 + i2n,
bn = φ(an) = 2 + i2n+1.
The points an and bn project onto the same point in ˆS. The horizontal line from an
to bn−1 has length 2−n so that
d(pn−1,pn) < 2−n
so that the sequence {pn} is a Cauchy sequence in ˆS, but it does not converge.
1.2.4 Annuli
We discuss now Riemann surfaces A which are diffeomorphic to (0,1) × S1 (open
annuli or cylinders).
Example 1.40 (Hyperbolic cylinders)
Consider the geodesic δ(t) = iet in H. Let
now γ and γ ′ be geodesics intersecting δ orthogonally at the points ia and ia′,
respectively, where a < a′ (see Fig. 1.5). Parameterize γ and γ ′ with unit speed
and with orientations as indicated in Fig. 1.5. Then the isometry Tℓ: z →a′
a z
(with ℓ= log(a′/a) to be consistent with our previous notation) maps δ onto it-
self, and it satisﬁes Tℓ(γ (t)) = γ ′(t). We obtain a hyperbolic surface (see Fig. 1.6)
Cℓby identifying γ (t) with γ ′(t). The geodesic arc δ|[loga,loga′] projects onto

Γℓ= {T k

tained by using Fermi coordinates. Then
Cℓ= R × R/[t ∼t + ℓ]
and the metric is given by
ds2 + cosh2 s dt2
where t is the parameter along the geodesic δ while s ∈R parametrizes the half-
circles perpendicular to δ.

in H consisting of all points x + iy with y > 1
2 and 0 ≤x ≤1. The parabolic isome-
try P : z →z + 1 then identiﬁes the left and the right sides of the domain which are
both geodesics. We call the resulting surface C the standard cusp (see Fig. 1.7). It
can also be viewed as {z ∈H|Im(z) > 1
2}/G where G = {P k |k ∈Z}. We note that
a cusp has ﬁnite area since
area =

t0 ∈R must intersect γ and γ ′ at a different angle, hence c projects to a geodesic on
Cℓwhich has a self-intersection but is not closed. Similarly, show that there are no
closed geodesics on the parabolic cylinder.
Note that the metrics on the hyperbolic cylinders and the parabolic cylinder are
complete because they come from the complete metric on the hyperbolic plane. The
following statement is a consequence of the uniformization theorem:
Proposition 1.43 (Classiﬁcation of open annuli up to conformal equivalence) Let
A be an open annulus with some complex structure j. Then A is conformally equiv-
alent either to C/Z (the elliptic cylinder) or the parabolic cylinder or exactly one of
the hyperbolic cylinders H/Γℓfor some ℓ> 0.
Proof Let p : ˆA →A be its universal covering. By the uniformization theorem ˆA is
conformally equivalent either to C or to H. The case S2 cannot occur because A is
not compact. The group G of covering transformations is isomorphic to π1(A) = Z,
it is a subgroup of Conf(C) = {z →az + b |a,b ∈C} or Conf(H), respectively,
and it acts freely, i.e. without ﬁxed points. In the case of the complex plane, G is
generated by a translation z →z + b which yields a cylinder C/Z. In the case of the
hyperbolic plane, a generator of G is conjugate to either a hyperbolic isometry Tℓ
for some ℓ> 0 or to the parabolic isometry z →z + 1.
□
Example 1.44 Recall the (open) cylinder ˆS from Example 1.39. How does it relate
to the classiﬁcation result Proposition 1.43? We will explicitly determine its confor-
mal class. The cylinder ˆS can be described alternatively as
ˆS = H ++/{z ∼2z}
where H ++ := {z ∈H + |Re(z) > 0} which we equip with the standard complex
structure i and the metric gH ++ = Im(z)−2geucl and which is not complete. The
cylinder ˆS inherits a metric and a complex structure from H ++ because the trans-
formation z →2z is at the same time holomorphic and an isometry. The projection
H ++ →ˆS is a covering map, and H ++ is the universal cover of ˆS. The transforma-
tion z →√z is a conformal isomorphism from (H +,i) to (H ++,i), and the map
z →2z corresponds to the transformation z →4z on H +. Hence ˆS is conformally
equivalent to the hyperbolic cylinder H +/{z ∼4z}, and it admits a complete met-

ric with constant sectional curvature −1, the one induced from H +. We draw the
following conclusions:
(1) Proposition 1.43 does not see the metric structure on the annulus,
(2) there is more than one metric with constant sectional curvature −1 on ˆS which
induces the same complex structure.
Theorem 1.20 asserts that the metric becomes unique if we demand completeness.
Here is the Riemannian geometry version of Proposition 1.43. It is proved in
the same way using the Hopf–Killing theorem (Theorem 1.15) instead of the uni-
formization theorem:
Proposition 1.45 (Classiﬁcation of open annuli up to isometry) Let A be an open
annulus with a complete metric of constant sectional curvature 0 or −1. Then A is
isometrically isomorphic to one of the following models:
(1) C/Z with the metric induced by the Euclidean metric on C,
(2) the parabolic cylinder or exactly one of the hyperbolic cylinders H/Γℓwith the
induced metric from the hyperbolic plane.
Another description of the open annuli is given by the following: We identify
S1 with R/2πZ, and we equip R × S1 (and all cylinders contained therein) with
the standard complex structure i. Then we have the following conformal equiva-
lences:
R × S1 ≈C/Z,
(0,∞) × S1 ≈H/

P k |k ∈Z

and
(0,r) × S1 ≈H/Γℓ
with ℓ= 2π2
r .
The ﬁrst two assertions are trivial, the third is not much better. In fact, identifying
R2 with C the exponential map yields a conformal transformation from the strip
(0,π) × R to H. Now (0,r) × S1 = (0,r) × R/2πZ is conformally equivalent
to (0,π) × R/ 2π2
r Z via (s,t) →π
r (s,t), and the exponential map transforms the
2π2
r Z action on the second factor of (0,π)×R into a T2π2/r action on the hyperbolic
plane H.
Deﬁnition 1.46 Let A be an annulus such that A\∂A is conformally equivalent to
(0,r) × S1 for some 0 < r ≤+∞. Then r is called the modulus of A.

has three degenerate sides
1.2.5 Hexagons in the Upper Half Plane and Pairs of Pants
Our aim is now to build stable hyperbolic surfaces from simple building blocks,
the so-called pairs of pants. In the next section we will show that this process is
reversible, any stable hyperbolic surface can be cut up into these elementary pieces.
Deﬁnition 1.47 A nondegenerate hexagon in the hyperbolic plane is a subset
G ⊂H with the following properties:
(1) G is compact,
(2) The boundary of G is piecewise smooth, and it consists of exactly six geodesic
arcs a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3 in H,
(3) At every vertex the two geodesic arcs meet at an angle of π/2,
(4) G is geodesically convex, i.e. if p,q ∈G then the geodesic arc connecting p
with q is also contained in G.
If one or more of the sides bk is replaced by a point on the real line or the point {∞}
then G is called a degenerate hexagon (see Fig. 1.8).
The metric gH + on the upper half plane induces a hyperbolic metric on any
hexagon. With respect to this metric hexagons always have ﬁnite area. In fact, they
have area equal to π (see [46] Proposition 1.3, [74] pp. 83–85). Consider now a
hexagon G ⊂H with sides a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3 parameterized on the unit inter-
val [0,1]. Let now G′ := {x + iy ∈C|x −iy ∈G} be a copy of G in the negative
half-plane H −. Denote the corresponding sides by a′
1,b′
1,a′
2,b′
2,a′
3,b′
3. We equip
H −with the complex structure −i and the metric y−2geucl. We construct a sur-
face Y by identifying the points ak(t) with a′
k(t) for k = 1,2,3 and 0 ≤t ≤1 (see
Fig. 1.9). The complex structures i on G and −i on G′ ﬁt together. Using Fermi
coordinates near the geodesics ak and a′
k which have equal lengths, we see that the
surface Y also inherits a hyperbolic metric from the two hexagons G and G′.

hexagons together, as labeled
in the ﬁgure
Deﬁnition 1.48
The surface Y together with its complex structure and its hyper-
bolic metric is called a pair of pants (see Fig. 1.10).
Remark 1.49 According to the above deﬁnition a pair of pants is a surface con-
structed by gluing together two hexagons (as described above) together with the
obvious hyperbolic metric and complex structure. Later we will show that any sur-
face diffeomorphic to a sphere with three punctures and equipped with a hyperbolic
metric of ﬁnite area can be obtained by the above construction.
If we repeat the same identiﬁcation with the closures of the two hexagons then
we obtain a compact topological space Y .
Deﬁnition 1.50 Let Y be a pair of pants. We call every point γ ∈Y\Y a degenerate
boundary component of length ℓ(γ ) equal to zero.
Remark 1.51 Because the area of a hexagon equals π, the area of a pair of pants
equals 2π.
Proposition 1.52
Let Y be a pair of pants with boundary components γ1,γ2,γ3
and lengths ℓ(γ1),ℓ(γ2),ℓ(γ3) ≥0. Then ℓ(γ1),ℓ(γ2),ℓ(γ3) determine Y up to
isometry.
Proof It sufﬁces to show that the corresponding statement holds for a hexagon G
in H, i.e. the lengths ℓ1,ℓ2,ℓ3 of the sides b1,b2,b3 determine G uniquely up to
orientation preserving isometry. Indeed, any pair of pants can be obtained by gluing
two congruent hexagons together along three of their geodesic boundary segments.
We will give an explicit geometric construction of a hexagon with prescribed lengths
for b1,b2,b3, and this construction leads to a unique hexagon up to isometry (see
Fig. 1.11).

Fig. 1.11 Building a
hexagon with prescribed
lengths ℓ(b1),ℓ(b2),ℓ(b3)
Assume ﬁrst that G is a hexagon with three degenerate sides b1,b2,b3. Then
there is an isometry φ ∈I such that φ(b1) = 0, φ(b2) = 1 and φ(b3) = ∞. Since
φ transforms geodesics into geodesics and since it preserves angles, φ(G) is again
a hexagon, and it looks like the last one in Fig. 1.8. Let us now assume that one of
the sides of G, say b1, has positive length. After applying a suitable isometry, we
may assume that the side b1 starts at the point i, it has non-negative real part, and
it is perpendicular to the imaginary axis. We will show that after these isometric
adjustments of the side b1 there is only one possibility to construct a hexagon from
the data ℓ1,ℓ2,ℓ3. Let α2 be the geodesic half-circle which contains the end point
of the side b1 and intersects b1 orthogonally there. Deﬁne now the set

If z = z1 + iz2 then d(z,iR+) = d(z,i|z|) because the function

assumes its inﬁmum at α = |z| (alternatively, the geodesic through the point z which

which implies that Γ is an Euclidean ray starting out in the origin. Let us assume
for the moment that also ℓ3 ̸= 0 so that Γ ̸= iR+. For x ≥supRe(α2) we consider
now the geodesic (half-circle) α3(x) which intersects the half-line Γ tangentially
and which has x as its left endpoint. There is exactly one such geodesic for each x.
The function

is strictly monotone increasing (show this as an exercise). We choose x in such a
way that dist(α3(x),α2) = ℓ2. Then x and α3(x) are uniquely determined by ℓ2
and α2. If ℓ2 > 0 then let b2 be the shortest geodesic segment connecting α2 and α3
so that ℓ(b2) = dist(α2,α3) = ℓ2 (see Proposition 1.31). If ℓ2 = 0 then we choose
x = supRe(α2) and b2 = {x}. Let now b3 be the shortest geodesic segment connect-
ing the point α3 ∩Γ with the imaginary axis. By construction of Γ , we already have
ℓ(b3) = ℓ3. In the case where ℓ3 = 0 the ray Γ coincides with iR+. We then deﬁne
α3(x) := x + iR+ instead, where x is chosen in such a way that ℓ2 = dist(α2,α3).
Apart from aligning the segment b1 in the beginning the construction of the hexagon
with data ℓ1,ℓ2,ℓ3 is unique.
□
By the lemma (Lemma 1.35) pairs of pants can be glued together along bound-
ary components of equal length so that the resulting surface inherits a hyperbolic
structure from the individual pieces. The parameters α ∈R/2πZ are called twist-
parameter. Any stable surface can be assembled by gluing pairs of pants together: If
S is a surface with a ﬁnite extension S →Σ then S is called stable if 2g+m+n ≥3
where g is the genus of Σ, m is the number of boundary components of S and of Σ
and n is the number of points in Σ\S (we assume that they are all interior points). If
g = 0 and n + m = 3 then S is already a pair of pants. If g = 1 and n + m = 1 then
S can be realized by gluing two boundary components of a pair of pants together.
By gluing two pants together as in Fig. 1.12 we obtain a so-called X-piece which
can be used to construct closed surfaces of arbitrary genus g greater than one. There

are g −1 X-pieces needed to assemble a closed surface of genus g. Introducing
an additional puncture or boundary component results in one additional pants (see
Fig. 1.13). Summarizing, every stable surface of signature (g,m,n) can be assem-
bled from 2g −2 + m + n pairs of pants. This also shows that stable surfaces admit
a hyperbolic metric with ﬁnite area. In the next section we are going to prove the
following statement:
Proposition 1.53 (Pair of pants decomposition for hyperbolic surfaces of ﬁnite
area)
Let S be a stable surface, i.e. S is obtained from a compact surface Σ of
genus g by removing n interior points, so that 2g + n + m ≥3 where m denotes
the number of boundary components. Assume that h is a hyperbolic metric on S
with ﬁnite area so that each component of ∂S is a closed geodesic. Then S can be
decomposed into pairs of pants, i.e. S is isometrically isomorphic to a hyperbolic
surface obtained by gluing pairs of pants along their boundary components.
We close this section with the proof of Theorem 1.20, the existence and unique-
ness of a Poincaré-metric on a stable Riemann surface assuming Proposition 1.53.
Proof of Theorem 1.20 (assuming Proposition 1.53) Let (S,j) be a Riemannian
surface with signature (g,m,n) so that 2g + n + m ≥3. Recalling the deﬁnitions,
this means that there is an embedding S →Σ into a compact surface Σ such that
∂S = ∂Σ and n = #(Σ\S) < ∞. The number m is the number of boundary compo-
nents of S, and g is the genus of Σ. We ﬁrst double the surface (S,j) to a Riemann
surface (Sd,jd) (in order to obtain a complex structure on the doubled surface we
have to equip the copy S′ with the complex structure −j). The map ι : S →S′ then
induces an antiholomorphic involution ι : Sd →Sd on the doubled surface so that
Fix(ι) :=

z ∈Sd |ι(z) = z

= ∂S.
The doubled surface has signature (2g +m−1,0,2n), hence it is also stable. Let ˆSd
be the universal cover of Sd and denote the induced complex structure by ˆjd. Ap-

1.2

plying the uniformization theorem (Theorem 1.14) and using the fact that (Sd,jd)
is stable, the universal cover ( ˆSd, ˆjd) is conformally equivalent to (H +,i). Hence
we may assume that
π :

H +,i

−→

Sd,jd
is the universal cover and π is holomorphic. Moreover, (Sd,jd) is conformally
equivalent to a quotient of H + by a subgroup of Conf(H) which acts freely and
properly discontinuously. The hyperbolic metric from H + then descends onto the
quotient. Denoting the induced metric on Sd by hd we may now assume in addition
that the covering projection π is a local isometry. The metric hd is a hyperbolic
metric which induces jd, and we claim that all components of ∂S ⊂Sd are closed
geodesics for hd. The antiholomorphic involution ι : (Sd,jd) →(Sd,jd) lifts to an
antiholomorphic involution I : (H +,i) →(H +,i). The map z
C→−¯z from H + to
itself is antiholomorphic, and z
φ→−I(z) is biholomorphic, hence it is in Conf(H).
Therefore, we have
I(z) = C

φ(z)

= −a¯z + b
c¯z + d
for suitable a,b,c,d ∈R with ad −bc = 1, and I is an isometry because C and
φ are. This implies that the involution ι : (Sd,hd) →(Sd,hd) is an isometry as
well. Assume now that p,q ∈∂S are two points in the same component of ∂S suf-
ﬁciently close to each other so that they lie in the same coordinate chart U. In each
homotopy class of paths δ : [0,1] →Sd from p to q there is exactly one geodesic.
The reason is that in the universal cover H there is exactly one geodesic deﬁned on
[0,1] connecting any two given points. Let now γ : [0,1] →U be the geodesic arc
connecting p and q. Then ι ◦γ is also a path connecting p and q, and it is also a
geodesic because ι is an isometry, hence γ ≡ι ◦γ . Then for each t ∈[0,1]
γ (t) ∈Fix(ι) = ∂S.
This completes the existence proof of a hyperbolic metric in each conformal class,
and ∂S is a union of closed geodesics as claimed. The uniqueness part is an easy
consequence of Lemma 1.22: If h1,h2 were two hyperbolic metrics on S inducing
the complex structure j then we would get two hyperbolic metrics hd
1,hd
2 on the
double inducing the same complex structure jd. Lemma 1.22 then asserts that the
two metrics on Sd are identical, therefore h1 ≡h2.
Assume now that j is a complex structure on S which is of ﬁnite type. Re-
calling the deﬁnition, this means that there is a ﬁnite extension i : S →Σ such
that i∗j extends to a complex structure jΣ on Σ. Let p ∈Σ\S. A suitable neigh-
borhood U ⊂Σ of p is conformally equivalent to the disk D ⊂C with the stan-
dard complex structure i. Then the open annulus U\{p} ⊂S is conformally equiv-
alent to (D\{0},i) and, by our remarks following Theorem 1.43, it is also con-
formally equivalent to the parabolic cylinder (H/G,i) where G := {P k |k ∈Z}
and P(z) = z + 1. Let h be the hyperbolic metric in the conformal class of j.
All we have to show is that a small neighborhood of the puncture p in S has ﬁ-

Summarizing, we have shown that the Poincaré-metric h on a stable surface S asso-
ciated to a complex structure of ﬁnite type satisﬁes area(S,h) < ∞. We still have to
show the following: Given a stable surface S with a hyperbolic metric h of ﬁnite area
then the induced complex structure j is of ﬁnite type, i.e. if S →Σ is a ﬁnite ex-
tension then j extends over the punctures. So far, we have not used Proposition 1.53
yet. Invoking it, we decompose S isometrically into pairs of pants. Punctures corre-
spond to degenerate boundary components of pairs of pants. Decomposing the pairs
of pants into two congruent hexagons, we can isometrically and conformally map
a degenerate boundary component to {∞}. A neighborhood of the puncture then
looks like the set Ω above which is conformally equivalent to a punctured disk, and
the complex structure extends.
□
1.2.6 Pairs of Pants Decompositions
One aim of this section is the proof of Proposition 1.53. We know already that a
stable surface is diffeomorphic to a surface obtained by gluing together pairs of
pants. The objective of Proposition 1.53 is to show that every stable surface with a
hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite area is actually isometric to one assembled from model

40

Riemann Surfaces
pairs of pants as in Deﬁnition 1.48. The gluing data, i.e. the lengths of the bound-
ary geodesics of the pants together with the twist parameters, determine the sur-
face up to isometry. By Theorem 1.20 the gluing data (also called Fenchel–Nielsen
parameters) then also determines the complex structures of ﬁnite type on the sur-
face S. Summarizing our efforts so far, we have managed to describe the space
J (S)ﬁnite/Diff+(S) by a ﬁnite set of real parameters (although the correspondence
between the Riemann moduli space and the Fenchel–Nielsen parameters is not one-
to-one if we view the twist parameters as real numbers vs. points on the circle).
Another important ingredient for proving compactness is Bers’ theorem which
asserts that one can always ﬁnd a pairs of pants decomposition where the lengths
of the boundary geodesics are bounded from above and controlled by the area of
the surface. A sequence of stable smooth surfaces would then converge to a noded
surface if some of these geodesics shrink to points.
Proposition 1.55
Let S be a surface with boundary and corners, and let h be a
complete metric on S with sectional curvature equal −1. Assume that each con-
nected component Γ of ∂S is of the following type:
• Γ is a closed geodesic or
• Γ is piecewise geodesic so that each two geodesic boundary arcs intersect at an
angle ≤π.
Then S can be isometrically embedded into a hyperbolic surface S∗without bound-
ary such that S is a deformation retract of S∗.
Proof We paste additional pieces to the boundary as follows: To each component
Γ of the boundary which is a closed geodesic we attach a hyperbolic ﬂare (see
Fig. 1.14) F which is half of a hyperbolic cylinder. More precisely, F is given by
F :=

z ∈H|Re(z) ≥0

/

z ∼eℓz

,
where ℓequals the length of Γ . If a component Γ of the boundary contains a
geodesic arc of length ℓthen we attach to it a strip {(x,y) ∈[0,∞) × [0,ℓ]}
equipped with the hyperbolic metric ds2 = dx2 + cosh2 x dy2 (compare with the
Fermi coordinates discussed earlier). After attaching these ‘Fermi strips’ we attach
at each vertex p with interior angle α ≤π an inﬁnite circle sector {p} ∪((0,∞) ×
[0,π −α]) equipped with the hyperbolic metric ds2 = dρ2 + sinh2 ρ dσ 2, where
0 < ρ < ∞, 0 ≤σ ≤π −α. Verify as an exercise that the surface S∗obtained this
way carries a complete metric.
□
Corollary 1.56 Let S be a hyperbolic surface with boundary and corners satisfying
the assumptions of Proposition 1.55. Then the universal cover of S is isometric to a
convex domain in H with piecewise geodesic boundary.
Proof Let S∗be the surface without boundary constructed in Proposition 1.55 and
let π : H →S∗be the (Riemannian) universal covering map. Let ˜S be a connected

1.2

Fig. 1.14 A hyperbolic ﬂare and ﬁlling the gap between two strips
component of π−1(S) ⊂H. Since π is a local isometry ˜S is a connected domain
in H with piecewise geodesic boundary, and all interior angles between geodesic
boundary arcs are ≤π. We use now the following lemma ([9], Theorem 7.5.1):
Lemma 1.57 A closed subset C ⊂H is convex if and only if it is connected and
locally convex.
(You should try to prove this as an exercise. First show that it is sufﬁcient to prove
the lemma for the Euclidean plane instead of the hyperbolic plane using the corre-
spondence by the hyperbolic plane and the upper half plane model, see Sect. 1.2.2).
Returning to the proof of the corollary, we conclude that ˜S must be convex since it is
locally convex by the assumption that all interior angles do not exceed π. In partic-
ular, ˜S is simply connected, and π| ˜S : ˜S →S is a universal cover. By Theorem 1.15
any other universal cover of S must be isometric to ˜S.
□
We start with the following proposition:
Proposition 1.58 Let S be a compact surface with ∂S ̸= ∅and hyperbolic metric h.
Let Γ0,Γ1 be two distinct connected components of ∂S which are closed geodesics.
Then there is a shortest geodesic arc δ : [0,1] →S without self-intersections with
δ(0) ∈Γ0 and δ(1) ∈Γ1. At its endpoints δ is perpendicular to Γ0 and Γ1. The
arc δ is unique in the following sense: If δ′ is another such arc which is homotopic
to δ, i.e. there is a homotopy h(s,t) with h(0,t) = δ(t), h(1,t) = δ′(t), h(0,t) ∈Γ0
and h(1,t) ∈Γ1 then δ ≡δ′. Moreover, if δ′ is a shortest geodesic arc connecting
two other boundary components Γ0 and Γ ′
1 where Γ ′
1 ̸= Γ1 then δ and δ′ do not
intersect.
Remark 1.59 If all curves connecting Γ0 with Γ1 are homotopic then δ is indeed
unique. This is the case if S is a surface diffeomorphic to a pair of pants. Figure 1.15

Let (δn)n∈N ⊂C be a minimal sequence, i.e.
ℓ(δn) →inf
δ∈C ℓ(δ) > 0.
We may replace the sequence (δn) with another which is piecewise geodesic.
Indeed, subdivide the interval [0,1] into subintervals [tj,tj+1] with tj < tj+1,
1 ≤j ≤m ∈N, t1 = 0, tm = 1 such that ℓ(δn|[tj ,tj+1]) is less than half the in-
jectivity radius of S for all j and n. Then we replace δn|[tj ,tj+1] with the shortest
geodesic segment connecting pj,n = δn(tj) with pj+1,n = δn(tj+1). This does not
change the fact that we are working with a minimal sequence. After passing to a
suitable subsequence, for each j the points pj,n will converge to points pj, and
the geodesic segments will converge as well to a geodesic segments between the
points pj and pj+1. Denote the resulting curve between p1 and pm by δ. Since
δ minimizes the length among all curves from p1 to pm it must be a geodesic. In
particular, it must be smooth. Moreover, it must intersect Γ0 and Γ1 orthogonally.
In order to see this, use Fermi coordinates near Γ0 and Γ0. Then the shortest curve
between Γ0 and δ(ε) is the geodesic arc intersecting Γ0 orthogonally and passing
through δ(ε). The curve δ has no self-intersections. Indeed, if we had 0 < t0 < t1 < 1
with δ(t0) = δ(t1) then the continuous curve δ|[0,t0] ∪δ|[t1,1] would connect Γ0 with
Γ1 and it is shorter than δ, a contradiction. Assume now that δ′ is a shortest geodesic
arc connecting Γ0 with another boundary component Γ ′
1 ̸= Γ1 and that there are

1.2

43
t0,t1 ∈(0,1) such that δ(t0) = δ′(t1). We may assume that ℓ(δ|[0,t0]) ≤ℓ(δ′|[0,t1]).
Then the curve δ[0,t0] ∪δ′|[t1,1] also connects Γ0 with Γ1, and it is has length less or
equal than δ′, hence it is also a smooth geodesic. The geodesics δ and δ′ must inter-
sect at a nonzero angle since a geodesic through a point is uniquely determined by
its tangent vector at that point. But this would imply that the curve δ[0,t0] ∪δ′|[t1,1] is
not smooth, a contradiction. Therefore, δ and δ′ cannot intersect at an interior point
t ∈(0,1). They cannot intersect at the endpoint t = 0 either because both δ and δ′
intersect Γ0 at a right angle, hence they would have to be equal. We still have to
show that δ is unique in its homotopy class. Assume not, i.e. let δ,δ′ be two shortest
homotopic geodesics connecting Γ0 with Γ1. Using a similar argument as before,
δ and δ′ do not intersect, and there is a geodesic quadrilateral Q in S with sides δ,
δ′ and two subarcs of Γ0 and Γ1, respectively. By Corollary 1.56 Q is isometric to
a right angled convex polygon in H with four vertices, but such a polygon does not
exist. This follows from the following theorem from [48] (Corollary 2.5.2) which is
a consequence of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem:

Proposition 1.61
Let S be a surface diffeomorphic to a nondegenerate pair of
pants equipped with a hyperbolic metric h so that ∂S consists of closed geodesics.
Then (S,h) is isometric to some pair of pants as in Deﬁnition 1.48.
Proof Let C1,C2,C3 be the boundary components of S, and let γij be the unique
shortest geodesic arc connecting Γi with Γj, i < j, i,j ∈{1,2,3} as in Propo-
sition 1.58. The arcs γij divide S into two compact simply connected hyperbolic
surfaces G1,G2. The boundary of each of them consists of six geodesic arcs which
intersect orthogonally. By Corollary 1.56 both G1,G2 are isometric to hexagons
˜G1, ˜G2 ⊂H. These two hexagons must be equal since the lengths of three of their
boundary arcs are equal, see the proof of Proposition 1.52.
□
If (S,h) is a stable surface with hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite area, we would like
to understand what S looks like metrically near its punctures. We start with the
following lemma:
Lemma 1.62
Let π : ˜S →S be the universal covering of a path-connected sur-
face S. Let U ⊂S be a path connected set and let V ⊂π−1(U) be a path-component
of π−1(U). Denote the group of covering transformations of π by D(π), and let
DV (π) :=

h ∈D(π)|h(V ) = V

.

44

Riemann Surfaces
Then
h(V ) ∩V = ∅
∀h ∈D(π)\DV (π).
Moreover, the map
V/DV (π) −→˜S/D(π) = S
DV (π) · x −→D(π) · x
is an embedding.
Proof Assume that h(V ) ∩V ̸= ∅. Because V is path connected so are h(V )
and V ∪h(V ). Since h satisﬁes π ◦h = π we have h(V ) ∪V ⊂π−1(U). Then
h(V ) ∪V = V because V was a path-component of π−1(U) and h(V ) ⊂V . Ap-
plying the same argument to h−1 yields h−1(V ) ⊂V , hence h(V ) = V , proving the
ﬁrst assertion. Recall that D(π) acts ﬁxed point free and properly discontinuously
on ˜S, i.e. every point x ∈˜S has an open neighborhood U such that g(U) ∩U = ∅
whenever g ∈D(π)\{Id}. Then DV (π) also acts ﬁxed point free and properly dis-
continuously on V . Then the projection
q : V −→V/DV (π)
is a covering map with covering transformation group D(q) = DV (π) (see [55],
Theorem 81.5). The map
V/DV (π) −→˜S/D(π)
is well-deﬁned and it is injective because of our ﬁrst assertion: If we had D(π) · x =
D(π) · y for some x,y ∈V then y = h(x) for a suitable h ∈D(π). But then y ∈
h(V )∩V , hence h ∈DV (π) and the equivalence classes of x and y in V/DV (π) are
identical. The quotients are Hausdorff because of the properly discontinuous action
(exercise !). The embedding property then follows from the covering property.
□
Proposition 1.63 (Normal form near a puncture—cusps) Let S be a stable surface
with a hyperbolic metric h of ﬁnite area such that ∂S consists of closed geodesics.
Assume that S →Σ is a ﬁnite extension, and let p ∈Σ\S be a puncture. Then there
exist an open neighborhood U ⊂Σ of p and an isometric embedding

Proof By doubling the surface we may assume without loss of generality that S has
no boundary and that
π : (H,gH +,i) −→(S,h,j)
is the universal covering, where π is a local isometry and holomorphic. Denote the
group of covering transformations by D(π) ⊂Conf(H). The complex structure j
on S is the one induced by h. Let V ⊂Σ be a closed neighborhood of the punc-
ture p so that V \{p} ⊂S is diffeomorphic to a semi-closed annulus. Let ˜V be a
path-connected component of π−1(V \{p}). By Lemma 1.62 and its proof the pro-
jection
q : ˜V −→˜V /D ˜V (π)
is a covering with covering transformation group
D ˜V (π) :=

and the map
˜V /D ˜V (π) −→˜S/D(π) = S
D ˜V (π) · x →D(π) · x
is an embedding. The map
˜π := π| ˜V : ˜V −→V \{p}
is also a covering map, and we can use ˜π,q and Lemma 1.62 to deﬁne a diffeomor-
phism
ψ : ˜V /D ˜V (π) −→V \{p}
in the obvious way such that ψ ◦q = ˜π. Then we have the following commutative

Then D ˜V (π) is isomorphic to N(H)/H where N(H) denotes the normalizer of

cyclic, in which case q would be the universal covering. Recall that D ˜V (π) ⊂
D(π) which consists of isometries of the hyperbolic plane acting without ﬁxed
points. Hence a generator α of D ˜V (π) is conjugate by an isometry φ either to
P ± : z →z ± 1 or to Tℓ: z →eℓz. Since (P ±)k,T k
ℓ̸= Id for any k ∈Z, α can-
not be of ﬁnite order. Using the isometry φ, the semi-closed annulus A is then
isometric to the quotient φ( ˜V )/G where G is the inﬁnite cyclic group gener-
ated by either P + or Tℓwith the induced metric from gH +. Moreover the set
φ( ˜V ) is closed5 in H, simply connected and invariant under the group action. Fig-
ure 1.16 shows what φ( ˜V ) typically looks like (the hyperbolic area of the fun-
damental domains indicated in the ﬁgure then equals the area of the annulus A).
Because

the group D ˜V (π) is inﬁnite cyclic generated by a parabolic transformation so that
A is indeed a cusp.
□
Remark 1.64 (Completing the proof of Theorem 1.20) The proof we gave earlier
of Theorem 1.20 partly relied on Proposition 1.53 which we have not proved yet.
Proposition 1.63 will be a crucial ingredient for the proof of Proposition 1.53, and it
can be used to close the gap in the proof of Theorem 1.20 as follows: Given a stable
surface S with a hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite area we have to show that the induced
complex structure j is of ﬁnite type, i.e. can be extended over the punctures. By
Proposition 1.63 a neighborhood of a puncture is isometric to a standard cusp. The
induced complex structure on the standard cusp makes it conformally equivalent to
the punctured disk, i.e. the complex structure extends.
Proposition 1.65 (Straightening closed curves) Let S be a stable surface, and let
h be a hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite area. If ∂S ̸= ∅, we assume that ∂S consists of
closed geodesics. Assume that α : [0,1] →S\∂S, α(0) = α(1), is a closed curve
5Recall that ˜V is a connected component of the set π−1(V \{p}) which is closed in H, hence ˜V is
itself closed in H.

which is not homotopic to a point and which is not homotopic to a puncture either.6
Then the free homotopy class of α contains a closed geodesic γ which is unique up
to reparametrization and which is either disjoint from ∂S or contained in ∂S. If the
curve α is simple7 then γ is also simple. Moreover, if α1,α2 are two such curves
which are disjoint then the corresponding geodesics γ1 and γ2 are either disjoint or
they agree as point sets.
Proof Assume ﬁrst that ∂S = ∅. Let π : H →S be the universal cover. Any lift
˜α : [0,1] →H of the loop α satisﬁes ˜α(0) ̸= ˜α(1). We can now associate to α a
unique covering transformation Γα : H →H by solving the following lifting prob-
lem:
(H, ˜α(1))
Γα ↗
⏐⏐π
(H, ˜α(0)) −−−−→

(S,α(0))
We gather some facts from topology
• Γα only depends on the homotopy class of α,
• the assignment [α] →Γα deﬁnes a group isomorphism π1(S,α(0)) →D(π),
where D(π) denotes the group of covering transformations,
• Γα ∈Conf(H) acts ﬁxed point free, hence it is either parabolic or hyperbolic by
Lemma 1.28.
If we view α and ˜α as curves deﬁned on R such that α(0) = α(1) then we have for
all t
˜α(t + 1) = Γα

So there is φ ∈Conf(H) such that φΓαφ−1 either equals P ± : z →z ± 1 or
Tℓ: z →eℓz for some ℓ> 0. Replacing the universal cover π with the universal
cover π ◦φ−1 and replacing ˜α with φ(˜α) we may assume that Γα equals one of
these standard isometries. Hence we have to consider the following two cases (see
Fig. 1.17):
(1) ˜α(t + 1) = ˜α(t) ± 1
(2) ˜α(t + 1) = eℓ˜α(t).
Our ﬁrst objective is to show that case (1) cannot occur. Assume it does, and consider
the following homotopy:
˜h : (0,1] × R −→H
˜h(s,t) := ˜α(t) + i
1
s −1

6If i : S →Σ is a ﬁnite extension then a closed curve γ in S is called homotopic to a puncture if
i ◦γ is homotopic to a point in Σ\S.
7This means that α : (0,1] →S is injective.


which implies that h(s,t + 1) = h(s,t) for h := π ◦˜h, hence all the curves
γs = h(s,∗) are closed curves. Moreover, we have ℓ(γs) →0 as s →0. Remem-
ber now that the hyperbolic metric on S is complete. This is equivalent to the fact
that (S,dist) as a metric space is complete and that any closed and bounded subset
of (S,dist) is compact (see [28], Corollary 2.105). If sups>0 dist(γs(0),α(0)) < ∞
then the curves γs remain in a compact subset of S. If s is sufﬁciently small
then γs lies in a coordinate chart. Then it is a contractible curve in contradic-
tion to the assumption that α is not homotopic to a point. On the other hand, if
sups>0 dist(γs(0),α(0)) = ∞then for small s the curves γs lie in a neighborhood
of a puncture. By Proposition 1.63, we may assume that they all lie in the stan-
dard cusp, and their lengths still converge to zero. Since none of the curves γs is
null-homotopic, they must be homotopic to a puncture, but this is also excluded
by assumption. We have shown that only case (2) occurs, hence Γα(z) = eℓz. If
˜γ (t) := ietℓis the geodesic on iR+ with speed ℓthen
˜γ (t + 1) = Γα

We deﬁne now a homotopy
˜h : [0,1] × R −→H
˜h(s,t) := (1 −s)˜α(t) + s ˜γ (t),
and we note that

Then
h(s,t + 1) = h(s,t)
where h := π ◦˜h,
and h is a free homotopy between α and the closed geodesic γ := π ◦˜γ (note that
the equivariance condition ˜h(s,t + 1) = Γα(˜h(s,t)) is needed to guarantee that all
the curves ˜h(s,∗) project onto smooth curves in S).
As for uniqueness, let α, γ , Γα(z) = eℓz as before and let δ : [0,1] →S be
another closed geodesic freely homotopic to α. Hence there is
h : [0,1] × R −→S
with h(0,t) = α(t),h(1,t) = δ(t). Let ˜α be the same lift as before such that
˜α(t + 1) = eℓ˜α(t). Lift the homotopy to one in the hyperbolic plane
˜h : [0,1] × R −→H
such that ˜h(0,t) = ˜α(t). All the curves h(s,∗) in S are closed, hence there are
covering transformations Γs such that
˜h(s,t + 1) = Γs
˜h(s,t)

.
The homotopy ˜h is continuous, the covering transformation group D(π) is discrete
and Γ0 = Γα, hence Γs ≡Γα for all s. Denoting the lift ˜h(1,t) of δ(t) by ˜δ(t) we
get
˜δ(t + 1) = Γα
˜δ(t)

= eℓ˜δ(t).
This implies that δ(R) = iR+. Since geodesics are uniquely determined by their
initial point and their initial velocity we obtain δ(t) = γ (c0t + c1) for suitable con-
stants c0,c1. This completes the uniqueness proof.
We are now going to show that γ is simple if α is. Arguing indirectly, we assume
that α is simple but γ is not. Then we are in one of the following situations:
(i) The curve γ has a transverse self-intersection
(ii) The curve γ does not have a transverse self-intersection, but γ is a multiple
cover of a simple closed geodesic, i.e. γ = γ m
0 , m ∈Z\{−1,0,+1}
Let ˜α,Γα(z) = eℓz,γ, ˜γ as before. We will ﬁrst prove the following claim:
Claim Assume α is simple. Let σ be a covering transformation of the universal
cover π : H →S such that σ(˜α(R)) ̸= ˜α(R). Then
σ

˜α(R)

∩˜α(R) = ∅.
We will assume that, σ(˜α(R)) ∩˜α(R) ̸= ∅and we will show that this either
implies that α is not simple or that σ(˜α(R)) = ˜α(R). Let t0,s ∈R such that

˜α(t0 + q)

= ˜α(t0).
Applying the projection π we obtain
α(t0 + q) = α(t0)
which means that α is not simple. This completes the proof of the claim.
We deal with case (i) ﬁrst, i.e. assume that γ has a transverse self-intersection
γ (t1) = γ (t2) = p. Let ˜γ be the lift of γ as before. Since D(π) acts transitively on
the ﬁbers of the universal cover there is φ ∈D(π) such that ˜γ (t2) = φ( ˜γ (t1)). Since
γ self-intersects transversally the two geodesics ˜γ and φ( ˜γ ) intersect at a nonzero
angle. Recall that by our construction earlier ˜γ (R) = iR+, and ˜α also had endpoints
0 and ∞, i.e.
lim
t→−∞˜α(t) = 0,
lim
t→+∞˜α(t) = ∞.
In order for ˜γ and φ( ˜γ ) to intersect at a nonzero angle, the geodesic φ( ˜γ ) must
be a half-circle with one endpoint on the negative real axis and the other on the
positive real axis. Figure 1.18 depicts the situation. It follows that the curves ˜α and
φ(˜α) have to intersect as well. On the other hand ˜α ̸= φ(˜α) since they have different
endpoints. This is a contradiction to the claim above, hence case (i) cannot occur.
Assume now that α is simple, but γ = γ m
0 for a simple closed geodesic γ0 and
an integer m with |m| > 1. Then the points ˜γ (t + 1
m) and ˜γ (t) lie in the same ﬁber

and φm = Γα, i.e. φ(z) = eℓ/mz. Consider now the curves ˜α and φ(˜α). We claim
that they intersect. In order to see this we introduce Fermi coordinates, i.e.

then

From ˜α(t + 1) = Γα(˜α(t)) we conclude that
α1(τ + 1) = α1(τ)
and
α2(τ + 1) = α2(τ) + 1
and therefore
lim
τ→±∞α2(τ) = ±∞.
(1.9)
Since the curve ˜α is simple it divides R2 into two connected components R2
left and
R2
right. Recalling that α1 is 1-periodic, we pick τ∗< 0 and τ ∗> 1 such that α1(τ∗) =
minα1 and α1(τ ∗) = maxα1. Because of (1.9) we have

of the same curve and they agree in the point t0.

Assume now that α1 and α2 are two curves as in the proposition which are dis-
joint. If the corresponding geodesics γ1 and γ2 did not agree or were not disjoint
then they would have a transverse self-intersection. Let ˜γ1, ˜γ2, ˜α1, ˜α2 be the corre-
sponding lifts, and we may assume that ˜γ1(R) = iR+. Following similar arguments
as before, when we discussed case (i), there is φ ∈D(π) such that the geodesics
˜γ1 and φ( ˜γ2) intersect transversally. Then the situation is again similar to Fig. 1.18
and the curves ˜α1, φ(˜α2) intersect as well. Projecting into S this would imply the
contradiction α1 ∩α2 ̸= ∅. The case where ∂S ̸= ∅then simply follows from taking
the double of S.

ment can be reﬁned as follows: The corresponding geodesics γ1 and γ2 agree as
point sets if and only if there are nonzero integers k1,k2 such that αk1 and αk2
are freely homotopic. Assume that γ1(R) = γ2(R). Then there are nonzero integers
k1,k2 such that γ k1
1
and γ k2
2
are freely homotopic. Then so are αk1 and αk2. If αk1
and αk2 are freely homotopic then we proceed as in the uniqueness proof above and
lift the homotopy to the universal cover. Then

with the same covering transformation Γ ∈D(π) for both curves. This implies that
γ1(R) = γ2(R).
We would like to generalize Proposition 1.61 to degenerate pairs of pants using
Proposition 1.63.
Proposition 1.67
Let S be a surface diffeomorphic to a pair of pants equipped
with a hyperbolic metric h of ﬁnite area so that ∂S consists of closed geodesics.
Then (S,h) is isometric to some pair of pants.
Proof The surface S is diffeomorphic to a sphere with three items removed where
an item is either a point or an open disk. Proposition 1.63 implies that for every
p ∈S2\S we can ﬁnd a neighborhood V ⊂S2 such that V \{p} is isometric to
C :=

z ∈H|Im(z) ≥K > 0

/{z ∼z + 1}.
We call the set ∂C a horocycle around p. It has two important properties:
• the shortest geodesic segment between ∂C and a point q /∈∂C intersects ∂C
orthogonally

Fig. 1.19 The surface S0 and
geodesics connecting the
boundary components
• all geodesics intersecting ∂C orthogonally converge to the puncture (in the Eu-
clidean metric).
If we remove for each puncture p the open set
◦
V \{p} from S then we obtain a com-
pact surface S0 (see Fig. 1.19) which is diffeomorphic to a disk with two smaller
disks removed. The boundary components are either closed geodesics or horocy-
cles. A careful examination of the proof of Proposition 1.58 shows that it can be
applied to the surface S0. Cutting S open along the three geodesics between the
boundary components/punctures shows that S is obtained from gluing together two
simply connected hyperbolic surfaces with piecewise geodesic boundary which are
isometric to a (possibly degenerate) hexagon. This proves the proposition.
□
We now can prove Proposition 1.53 which we state again:
Proposition Let S be a stable surface, i.e. S is obtained from a compact surface Σ
of genus g by removing n interior points, so that 2g + n + m ≥3 where m denotes
the number of boundary components. Assume that h is a hyperbolic metric on S
with ﬁnite area so that each component of ∂S is a closed geodesic. Then S can be
decomposed into pairs of pants, i.e. S is isometrically isomorphic to a hyperbolic
surface obtained by gluing pairs of pants along their boundary components.
Proof Using the procedure explained on page 36, we decompose S diffeomorphi-
cally into pairs of pants, i.e. we can ﬁnd disjoint simple closed curves on S which
decompose S into pieces diffeomorphic to pairs of pants. By Proposition 1.65 we
can replace the curves by closed geodesics. By Proposition 1.67 each such piece is
then isometric to a ‘standard’ pair of pants, i.e. one obtained by gluing two hexagons
in H together.
□
Remark 1.68 Assume that S is a connected stable surface and that h is a hyperbolic
metric on S with ﬁnite area so that each component of ∂S is a closed geodesic.

Fig. 1.20 A good pairs of pants decomposition
Since every connected stable surface of signature (g,m,n) can be assembled from
2g −2 + m + n pairs of pants, its area equals
areah(S) = 2π(2g −2 + m + n).
Proposition 1.53 is an important milestone towards a compactness theorem for
stable Riemannian surfaces. If (S,j) is a stable Riemann surface so that j is of ﬁ-
nite type, i.e. it extends over the punctures. Then we can associate to j a unique
hyperbolic metric h with ﬁnite area. We now know that S can be decomposed iso-
metrically into 2g −2 + m + n pairs of pants. The metric h can be recaptured up to
diffeomorphism from the lengths {ℓk} of the boundaries of the pants and the twist
parameters {αj} ⊂[0,1] used to glue them together. Since we are now considering
isometric stable surfaces equivalent, we may assume that 0 ≤α ≤1. If we now have
a sequence (S,jn) of such surfaces we would like to deﬁne a notion of convergence
based on the data {{ℓ(n)
k },{α(n)
j }}. The problem is that there are different ways to
assign data to a surface (S,j) because it can be decomposed into pairs of pants in
more than one way. Figure 1.20 depicts a sequence Sn = (S,jn,hn) of stable hyper-
bolic surfaces such that S is closed of genus 2 such that the geodesics γ n
1 ,γ n
3 have
constant lengths ℓhn(γ n
1 ) ≡c1 > 0 and ℓhn(γ n
3 ) ≡c3 > 0 while ℓhn(γ n
2 ) →0. We
would then declare the noded surface depicted in the ﬁgure to be the limit of the
sequence Sn. Figure 1.21 depicts the same situation, but with the wrong choice of
decomposition. Replacing γ n
2 with the geodesic loops δn
2 we see that the lengths of
the loops δn
2 tend to inﬁnity.
The following theorem by L. Bers asserts that one can always ﬁnd good pairs of
pants decompositions:
Theorem 1.69 (Bers’ theorem [11])
Let (S,h) be a stable hyperbolic surface of
ﬁnite area and with signature (g,m = 0,n), i.e. ∂S = ∅. Then there is a constant
C > 0 only depending on g,n and a pair of pants decomposition of S such that the
length of each boundary component of each pant is bounded by C.
We will address Bers’ theorem later.

1.2.7 Thick–Thin Decomposition and Collar Lemma
If (S,h) is a stable hyperbolic surface and γ a closed geodesic then γ has a neigh-
borhood which is isometric to a piece of a hyperbolic cylinder. We are going to prove
the collar lemma which asserts that the shorter the closed geodesic γ the wider the
collar which can be placed around it.
Proposition 1.70 (The Collar lemma for pairs of pants) Let Y be a pair of pants.
Then the following holds:
• Let γ be a component of ∂Y which is a closed geodesic of length ℓ. Then γ has a
closed neighborhood C(γ ) isometric to

where ∼denotes the equivalence relation z ∼z′ if and only if there is k ∈Z such
that z′ = ekℓz (see Fig. 1.22).
• If γ is a degenerate boundary component of Y then there is a closed subset
C(γ ) ⊂Y isometric to

z ∈H|Im(z) ≥1/2

/∼
such that C(γ ) ∪{γ } is a neighborhood of γ in the compactiﬁcation Y of Y. Here
∼denotes the equivalence relation z ∼z′ if and only if there is k ∈Z such that
z′ = z + k.
The interiors of the distinguished collar neighborhoods mentioned above are dis-
joint.
Before we start with the proof of Proposition 1.70 we need some preparation.

Lemma 1.74 Let γ and γ ′ be two distinct geodesics in H. Denote their points at

Proof After applying suitable isometries we may assume that
v′ = ∞
and
u = −v > 0.
(Since the two geodesics are distinct, one end of γ ′ must be different from both ends
of γ . Let this end be v′. Applying an isometry we may assume that v′ = ∞. Then
γ is a half-circle. Then use a translation to move the center to the origin.) Now γ is
the half-circle with center 0 and radius u and
r = u′ −u

the circle containing the segment b1 is given by y2 = r2 −(x −x0)2. We obtain

Nondegenerate case
Proof of Proposition 1.70, the collar lemma for pairs of pants Let Y be a pair of
pants with possibly degenerate boundary components γ1,γ2,γ3. We decompose
the pants Y into two possibly degenerate congruent hexagons G and G′. It suf-
ﬁces to prove the corresponding statement for the hexagon G in H. In Proposi-
tion 1.63 we have only shown that each puncture has a neighborhood isometric to
{z ∈H|Im(z) ≥κ}/{z ∼z + 1} for some κ > 0. Let a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3 be the
consecutive sides of G. We have to show that there is enough room in G for collar
neighborhoods
C(bk) :=

sinhβk ≤1

if βk := 1
2ℓ(γk) > 0
and cusp neighborhoods with ﬁxed area. Let us start with the nondegenerate case
where β1,β2,β3 > 0. In order to show that C(b2) ∩C(b3) = ∅let γ ⊂G be the
shortest geodesic connecting b1 with a3 as in Fig. 1.27. The geodesic γ divides G
into two right angled pentagons. The pentagon lemma, Lemma 1.76, now yields
1 < cosh

ℓ(x)

= sinh(β3)sinh

ℓ(y)

= sinh(β3)sinh

This implies that γ ∩C(b3) = ∅. Now
1 < cosh




ℓ(a3) −ℓ(y)

= sinh(β2)sinh

dist(γ,b2)

so that also γ ∩C(b2) = ∅. Hence the geodesic γ separates C(b3) from C(b2).
Proceeding similarly for other pairs of collar neighborhoods we ﬁnd that they
are pairwise disjoint. Consider now the case where all sides are degenerate, i.e.
βk = 0 for all k = 1,2,3. There is an isometry φ such that φ(b1) = 0, φ(b2) = 1,
φ(b3) = ∞. Hence we may assume that G is the hexagon with the sides a1 = iR+,
a2 = 1

2eiθ, 0 ≤θ ≤π and a3 = 1 + iR+ (see Fig. 1.28). Recall that the pair of

segment a2 is divided into two segments a21 and a22. Lemma 1.75 then yields
sinhβ1 sinhℓ(a21) = 1 = sinhβ2 sinhℓ(a22).
We get from this
w(b1) + w(b2) = ℓ(a21) + ℓ(a22) = ℓ(a2) = dist(b1,b2),

The following theorem is a summary of Theorem 1.20 (existence and uniqueness
of a Poincaré metric), Proposition 1.53 (decomposing surfaces into pairs of pants)
and Proposition 1.70, the collar lemma for pairs of pants:

Riemann Surfaces
Theorem 1.78 (The Collar lemma) Let S be a stable Riemann surface with com-
plex structure of ﬁnite type and of signature9 (g,m,k). Let γ1,...,γn be pairwise
disjoint simple closed geodesics on S (with respect to the Poincaré metric). Then
n ≤3g −3 + m + k and
(1) There are simple closed geodesics γn+1,...,γ3g−3+m+k so that γ1,...,
γ3g−3+m+k decompose S into pairs of pants.
(2) Each puncture has a neighborhood (a ‘cusp’) isometric to {z ∈H|Im(z) ≥
1/2}/{z ∼z + 1}. Denote these neighborhoods by C1,...,Ck. Their interiors
are pairwise disjoint.
(3) The collars
C(γi) :=

p ∈S |dist(p,γi) ≤w(γi)

,
where i = 1,...,3g −3 + m + k and where10

2ℓ(γi))

have pairwise disjoint interiors, and their interiors do not intersect any of the
open cusps
◦
Cj, j = 1,...,k.
(4) Each collar C(γi) is isometric to the cylinder [−w(γi),w(γi)] × S1 with the
metric ds2 = dρ2 + ℓ2(γi)cosh2 ρ dt2 with (ρ,t) ∈[−w(γi),w(γi)] × S1.
Remark 1.79 By the uniqueness property in Proposition 1.65 the geodesics γ1,...,
γ3g−3+m+k must lie in different free homotopy classes.
We note the following useful corollary.
Corollary 1.80 Let S be a stable Riemann surface with complex structure of ﬁnite
type and of signature (g,m,k) equipped with its Poincaré metric. Let γ,δ be closed
geodesics which intersect transversally, and assume that γ is simple. Then

Proof By doubling the surface we may assume that it has no boundary and that the
universal cover is H. Let ˜γ , ˜δ be intersecting lifts of γ and δ, respectively. Let
˜C( ˜γ ) :=

z ∈H|dist(z, ˜γ ) ≤w(γ )

.
This set projects onto the collar C(γ ) ⊂S. Then ˜δ connects the two boundary com-
ponents of ˜C( ˜γ ). Projecting onto S, the geodesic δ contains an arc δ0 which connects
the two boundary components of C(γ ). Then ℓ(δ) ≥ℓ(δ0) ≥2w(γ ).
□
9g is the genus of a ﬁnite extension, m is the number of boundary components and k is the number
of punctures. Stability means that 2g + m + k ≥3.
10The number w(γi) is called the width of the collar γi.

Deﬁnition 1.81 A short geodesic is a simple closed geodesic γ with length less or
equal to 2sinh−1(1) = 2log(1 +
√
2).
Remark 1.82 Any two short geodesics must be disjoint by the above corollary.
Let S be a stable hyperbolic surface of ﬁnite area and of signature (g,0,k), i.e.
∂S = ∅. Let p ∈S and Br(p) := {q ∈S |d(q,p) < r}. The injectivity radius at p is
deﬁned by
rp := sup

r > 0|Br(p) is isometric to an open disk in H

.
In the following lemma we give an alternative description of the injectivity radius:
Lemma 1.83 Let S be as above and p ∈S. If π : H →S is the universal cover and
if D(π) denotes the group of covering transformations so that S = H/D(π) then
rp = 1
2ℓ(γp) = 1

inf
φ∈D(π)\{Id}d

˜p,φ( ˜p)

,
where ˜p ∈π−1(p) and where γp is the shortest geodesic loop through p.11
Proof Assume that rp > 1
2ℓ(γp). Then pick a number r with rp > r > 1
2ℓ(γp). We
have γp ⊂Br(p) which is isometric to a disk of radius r in the hyperbolic plane,
but there are no geodesic loops there. This contradiction shows that
rp ≤1
2ℓ(γp).
Let π :H→S be the universal cover, and let p1,p2 ∈π−1(p). Then d(p1,p2)≥2rp.
Otherwise the geodesic arc connecting p1 with p2 would project to a geodesic
loop γ through p with 1
2ℓ(γ ) < rp ≤1
2ℓ(γp) contradicting the fact that γp is the
shortest such geodesic loop. Let now r = 1
2ℓ(γp) and show that for ˜p ∈π−1(p) the
restriction of π to Br( ˜p) is injective, then r ≤rp and we would be done. Arguing in-
directly, we assume that q1,q2 ∈Br( ˜p) are two distinct points with π(q1) = π(q2).
Let φ be the covering transformation with q2 = φ(q1). Let ˆp := φ( ˜p). Then
d( ˜p, ˆp) ≤d( ˜p,q2) + d

φ(q1),φ( ˜p)

< 2r.
Connecting ˜p and ˆp with a geodesic arc and projecting into S we obtain a geodesic
loop through p with length smaller than 2r contradicting the deﬁnition of r. This
also shows that there are lifts p1,p2 of p with d(p1,p2) = 2rp. We conclude

d(p1,p2)|p1 ̸= p2, p1,p2 ∈π−1(p)

completing the proof.
□
11A geodesic loop through p is a geodesic segment c : [0,1] →S such that c(0) = p = c(1). Note
that this is not necessarily a closed geodesic. If there is no such loop then we set ℓ(γp) = ∞.

Deﬁnition 1.84 Let ε ∈(0,sinh−1(1)) and let S be again a stable hyperbolic surface
of ﬁnite area and with empty boundary. We deﬁne the ε-Thick part and the ε-Thin
part of S by
Thickε(S) := {p ∈S |rp ≥ε}
Thinε(S) := {p ∈S |rp < ε}.
In the next theorem, we give a characterization of the thin part of S.
Theorem 1.85 (Thick–Thin decomposition) Let S be as above, and let β1,...,βn
be the set of all short geodesics. Denote by C(βj), j = 1,...,n the collar neighbor-
hoods around the geodesics βj, and let C1,...,Ck be the cusp neighborhoods of the
punctures as in Theorem 1.78. If p ∈S such that rp ≤sinh−1(1) then
p ∈

Proof By Corollary 1.80 the geodesics β1,...,βn are pairwise disjoint. Let p ∈S
with rp ≤sinh−1(1). By Lemma 1.83 there is a geodesic loop γp through p of
length 2rp. This loop is simple and it is not null-homotopic, otherwise it would lift to
a geodesic loop in the hyperbolic plane. Assume ﬁrst that γp is freely homotopic to
a puncture. Then γp lies in some large cusp neighborhood around the puncture. The
boundary of the standard cusp neighborhood has length 2, and every closed curve
homotopic to the puncture of length less or equals 2 must lie in the standard cusp.
Assume now that the loop γp is not freely homotopic to a puncture. The following
considerations rely on Proposition 1.65 and its proof. The loop γp is freely homo-
topic to a simple closed geodesic β. Denote the universal cover of S by π : H →S
and let D(π) be the group of covering transformations. Let ˜γ , ˜β be homotopic lifts
of γp and β, respectively. We may assume that ˜β(t)=ieℓt for some ℓ>0 so that also
˜γ (t + 1) = Γℓ

˜γ (t)

where Γℓ(z) = eℓz.
Let ˜p ∈˜γ (R) be a lift of p. The geodesic arc on ˜γ from ˜p to Γℓ( ˜p) has length 2rp.
If it agrees with ˜β then β = γp is a short geodesic and the assertion of the theorem
is proved. Otherwise, the arc does not intersect ˜β. Figure 1.32 depicts the situation.
We obtain a where the sides have lengths λ,2rp,λ,ℓ= ℓ(β) with quadrilateral
λ = dist( ˜p, ˜β) = dist

Γℓ( ˜p), ˜β

.
Let now h be the shortest geodesic arc between the segment (˜q,Γℓ(˜q)) ⊂˜β and
the segment ( ˜p,Γℓ( ˜p)) ⊂˜γ . We claim that the endpoints of the segment h di-
vide each of the segments (˜q,Γℓ(˜q)) and ( ˜p,Γℓ( ˜p)) into two segments of equal
length. This can be veriﬁed by a straightforward computation. We give an out-
line: The points ˜p = p1 + ip2 and Γℓ( ˜p) = eℓp1 + ieℓp2 both lie on a half-circle
C : y2 = r2−(x−x0)2 which is then determined by ˜p and ℓ. In particular, we obtain
the relation x2
0 −r2 = | ˜p|2eℓfrom this. In order to compute the shortest geodesic arc

(2) cosh ℓ

This means that β is one of the short geodesics β1,...,βn. We still have to

1.3 The Deligne–Mumford Compactness Result
Since a stable hyperbolic surface has several different pair of pants decompositions,
it is important to single out a particular one where the lengths of the boundaries of
the pants are bounded by some constant which does not depend on the hyperbolic
metric. This is accomplished by Bers’ theorem (Theorem 1.69). We will prove the
following version:
Theorem (Bers’ Theorem) Let (S,h) be a stable hyperbolic surface of ﬁnite area
and with signature (g,m,k) (recall that k denotes the number of punctures and m
denotes the number of boundary components). Then there is a constant C > 0 only
depending on g,k,m and the length ℓ(∂S) of ∂S and a pair of pants decomposition
of S such that the length of each boundary component of each pant is bounded by C.
There are ‘ﬁner’ versions of Bers’ result where C is given by an explicit formula
in terms of the data g,m,k,ℓ(∂S). In the case ∂S = ∅, m = k = 0 one can choose
C = 26(g −1). See [13, 14] for more on this topic. The above version of Bers’
theorem is not adequate to discuss convergence of surfaces with boundary because
the constant C will grow without bound if ℓ(∂S) does. Surfaces with boundary have
to be doubled along the boundary. We will discuss this in detail later on.
The main job will be proving the following lemma:
Lemma 1.86 Let S be as above. Assume in addition that S is not a pair of pants.
Then there is a simple closed geodesic γ with γ ∩∂S = ∅and
ℓ(γ ) ≤ℓ(∂S) + 5A(S),
where A(S) denotes the area of S.

1.3
The Deligne–Mumford Compactness Result
75
We remark again that the above estimate could be signiﬁcantly improved with
some care, but it is sufﬁcient for our purposes.
Proof We ﬁrst assume that S is closed, i.e. m = k = 0. Let γ be a closed geodesic
in S with minimal length. We claim that for any p ∈γ the set
Bℓ(γ )/2(p) =

q ∈S |d(p,q) < ℓ(γ )
2

is isometric to a ball in the hyperbolic plane with radius ℓ(γ )/2. If not then rp < ℓ(γ )
2
and we could ﬁnd a simple geodesic loop δ of length 2rp < ℓ(γ ). As in the
proof of Theorem 1.85 δ is freely homotopic to a simple closed geodesic β with
sinh ℓ(β)
2
≤sinhrp, by (1.16) and (1.17), hence ℓ(β) ≤2rp = ℓ(δ) < ℓ(γ ), a contra-
diction. We claim now that

Bℓ(γ )/2(p)


4 ℓ(γ )2.
(1.18)
In order to estimate the area of Bℓ(γ )/2(p) it sufﬁces to estimate the area of the ball
Bℓ(γ )/2(i) ⊂H. The map
φ : R+ × S1 −→H\{i}

Since this computation is a bit tedious we outline a few steps here. We have to ﬁnd

γ (t) = aietρ + b

If δ is a degenerate boundary component of S and if C(δ) is the standard cusp

tion for a hyperbolic disk before in geodesic polar coordinates. This time Fermi
coordinates should be used if γ0 is a closed geodesic, and the analogue of Fermi
coordinates if γ0 is the boundary circle of a cusp. By deﬁnition of r0 at least one of
the following two things happens:
Case (I):
There are two distinct boundary components γ1 and γ2 of ∂S1 and a

Case (II): There is a boundary component γ1 of ∂S1 and a point p ∈S1 such that
dist(p,γ1) = r0 and there are two distinct geodesic arcs from p to γ1 of
(minimal) length r0.
In case (I) let β be a piecewise geodesic segment connecting γ1 with p on one end
and p with γ2 on the other. In case (II) we concatenate the two geodesic arcs and
denote the result by β. The arc β must intersect γ1 (and γ2 in case (I)) orthogonally,
and its length equals 2r0. Because also dist(γ1,γ2) = 2r0, the segment β must in
fact be the smooth geodesic path connecting γ1 with γ2. In case (II) the path β is
smooth as well. Figure 1.34 illustrates the two cases.
Case (I)
Assume that the curves γ1,γ2 are deﬁned on the interval [0,1] so that
γk(0) = γk(1) = p, k = 1,2, and parameterize them in such a way that i ˙γ1(t), i ˙γ2(t)

point inwards. We assume that β runs from γ1 to γ2, and we denote the reverse path
by β−1. The closed loop γ2βγ1β−1 is homotopic to a closed loop c which is disjoint
from the boundary of S1. We may assume that c is as close to γ2βγ1β−1 as we wish,
hence we may assume that their lengths are also as close as we wish.
Any null-homotopic simple closed loop δ in a hyperbolic surface S bounds an
open disk.12 Therefore c cannot be null-homotopic since S would be diffeomorphic
to a cylinder otherwise, and we assumed that S is stable. The loop c cannot be
freely homotopic to a puncture either, otherwise S would be a pair of pants, and it
is not by assumption. By Proposition 1.65, the loop c is then freely homotopic to a
closed geodesic γ which cannot be a component of ∂S since S is not a pair of pants.
Note that ℓ(γ1),ℓ(γ2) ≥1 since γ1,γ2 are either boundaries of a cusp of length 1 or
boundaries of a collar of length 1 or boundary components of ∂S of length ≥1 (if
there are any). For any ε > 0 and suitable curve c we estimate using (1.19):


ℓ(∂S) + 5A(S)

.
Passing to the limit ε →0 we get
ℓ(γ ) ≤ℓ(∂S) + 5A(S)
which is the assertion of the lemma.13
Case (II)
The endpoints of β decompose γ1 into two segments γ ′ and γ ′′ as in-
dicated in Fig. 1.34. We choose now parametrizations so that γ ′β−1 and γ ′′β are
simple closed loops. One of the loops γ ′β−1 or γ ′′β must be freely homotopic to a
simple closed geodesic γ , otherwise S would either be a pair of pants or not stable,
and γ cannot be a boundary component of ∂S for the same reason. We then estimate
12This has actually nothing to do with the hyperbolicity assumption, and it can be seen as follows:
Let π : ˜S →S be the universal cover. By doubling the surface we may assume that ˜S = H. Let
D(π) be the group of covering transformations. Any lift ˜δ of δ is closed, and it bounds a disk D
because of the Jordan–Schoenﬂiess theorem. We claim that π|D : D →S is injective. If not then
there are distinct points p1,p2 ∈D which project onto the same point in S. Then there is a covering
transformation φ with p2 = φ(p1), i.e. φ(D) ∩D ̸= ∅. If φ(˜δ) ∩˜δ ̸= ∅, i.e. ˜δ(t1) = φ(˜δ(t2)) then
t1 = t2 because δ is simple. Hence ˜δ(t1) is a ﬁxed point of the covering transformation φ which
would imply φ = Id in contradiction to p1 ̸= p2. If we had φ(˜δ) ∩˜δ = ∅then we must have
φ(D) ⊂D (or D ⊂φ(D)), and φ (or φ−1) must have a ﬁxed point by Brouwer’s ﬁxed point
theorem. This would again contradict p2 ̸= p1.
13The ﬁrst inequality above holds because γ and c bound an annulus which is isometric to half of
a hyperbolic annulus.

Proof of Theorem 1.69 If S is a pair of pants then the assertion of the theorem
trivially holds. Otherwise, note that S has area 2π(2g −2 + m + k) and a pair of
pants decomposition consists of precisely 2g −2 + m + k pants. Using the lemma,
we choose a simple closed geodesic γ of length no more than ℓ(∂S) + 5A(S). This
geodesic is by construction not null-homotopic and not homotopic to a boundary
component of ∂S. We now cut S open along γ . Let us call the resulting surface S(1)
which satisﬁes
ℓ

∂S(1)

≤2ℓ(∂S) + 5A(S)
and it may of course consist of several connected components. Because γ is not null-
homotopic and not homotopic to a boundary component of ∂S all the components
of S(1) are either pairs of pants or other stable surfaces. We now apply the lemma
again to those components of S(1) which are not pairs of pants. We iterate this
procedure, and after at most 3g −3 + m+ k steps all the components resulting from
the cutting will be pairs of pants. We have ℓ(∂S(k)) ≤2ℓ(∂S(k −1)) + 5A(S), and
we obtain some universal bound for the boundary lengths of the pants as claimed. □
1.3.1 The Notion of Convergence
Deﬁnition 1.87 Let (Sn,rn) = (Sn,jn,Mn,Dn,rn) be a sequence of stable noded
decorated Riemann surfaces (see Sect. 1.1 for the deﬁnitions). We say the se-
quence (Sn,rn) converges to another stable noded decorated Riemann surface
(S,r) = (S,j,M,D,r) if the following conditions are satisﬁed (for sufﬁciently
large n): There exists a sequence of diffeomorphism
ϕn : SD,r →SDn,rn

,
ϕn(M) = Mn
such that
(1) The images ϕn(Γj) of the special circles14 Γj ⊂SD,r are either special circles
or closed geodesics of the metrics hjn on ˙SDn,rn = SDn,rn\Mn. Moreover, all
special circles in SDn,rn are of the form ϕn(Γj) for some j.

ifying the nodes by adding an S1 and then gluing them together using the decoration, see Fig. 1.3.

j be the geodesic arc with

cj and whose ends are contained in Thickε(S). Then C ∩δn
j converges in C0 to
a continuous geodesic for the metric hS which passes through the point cj (see
Fig. 1.35).
Remark 1.88 The second condition is equivalent to C∞

moval of singularity theorem (to be proved later) the convergence is actually in
C∞
loc(SD,r\
j Γj). This notion of convergence will be very convenient if the sur-
faces are domains for pseudoholomorphic curves. The model for all the surfaces
is SD,r which should be viewed as a noded surface. Then convergence of surfaces
basically means that after reparametrization of the domain, the complex structures
converge away from the nodes.
Deﬁnition 1.89 (Convergence for non-decorated nodal surfaces) A sequence
{Sn} ⊂Mg,μ is said to converge to a surface S ∈Mg,μ if there are decorations
rn for Sn and r for S such that (Sn,rn) →(S,r) in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.87.

Riemann Surfaces
The Deligne–Mumford compactness result is the following:
Theorem 1.90 (Deligne–Mumford compactness result [12, 19, 80])
The spaces
Mg,μ and M
$
g,μ are compact metric spaces, and they serve as compactiﬁcations
of the space Mg,μ, i.e. they coincide with the closure of Mg,μ when viewed as a
subspace of Mg,μ and M
$
g,μ, respectively.
We will later address the compactiﬁcation of the space Mg,m,μ of smooth stable
Riemann surfaces with boundary as well (where some of the marked point may
sit on the boundary). Since we will not discuss the explicit metric structure of the
spaces Mg,μ and M
$
g,μ, we will rather prove the following:
Theorem 1.91 (Deligne–Mumford compactness result—light version)
Assume
Sn = (Sn,jn,Mn) is a sequence of smooth marked stable Riemann surfaces of sig-
nature (g,μ) with ∂Sn = ∅. Then (Sn)n∈N has a subsequence which converges to a
stable noded Riemann surface S = (S,j,M,D) of signature (g,μ).
In the remainder of this section we will prove Theorem 1.91. Let Sn =
(Sn,jn,Mn) is a sequence of smooth marked stable Riemann surfaces of genus
g and with μ = #M. It will be convenient for this discussion to permit each surface
Sn to have m boundary components, but we assume that none of the marked points
lie on the boundaries. Let ˙Sn := Sn\Mn, and let hn be the hyperbolic metric of ﬁnite
area on ˙Sn determined by jn. More importantly, we will also assume that
sup
n
ℓ(∂Sn) < ∞
where the length is measured with respect to the metric hn. In order to generalize
Theorem 1.91 to stable surfaces with boundary we need to discuss also sequences
of surfaces where supn ℓ(∂Sn) = +∞. We will do this in the following section.
Using Proposition 1.53 we can now decompose each surface ˙Sn into pairs of
pants Y 1
n ,...,Y N
n where N = 2g −2 + m + μ. Denote by γ 1
n ,...,γ s
n, s = m + μ,
the boundary components of ˙Sn and let L1
n,...,Ls
n be their lengths (with respect
to hn). We also view the marked points Mn as degenerate boundary components of
˙Sn, where the corresponding variables Lk
n are zero. By assumption we have
sup

We denote by ℓ1
n,...,ℓr
n, r = 3g −3 + μ + m the lengths of the boundary com-
ponents of the pants which are not boundary components of Sn, and we write
α1
n,...,αr
n for the corresponding twist parameters. By Theorem 1.69 we may as-
sume in addition that

by choosing the pairs of pants decomposition in a suitable way. The number of
pair of pants decompositions of a hyperbolic surface is bounded in terms of the
signature, hence we may assume that for each n there is an orientation preserving
diffeomorphism ϑn : ˙S1 →˙Sn which sends each pant Y j
1 onto Y j
n , 1 ≤j ≤N. We
ﬁx an ordering of the boundary components of the pants {Y j

the pants {Y j

We assume now that

(1.21)
Note that this is not a real restriction. If some of the sequences {ℓj
n}n∈N are not
bounded away from zero then we just cut the surfaces open along these geodesics,
and we treat them as boundary components. They occur in pairs, and they will lead
in the limit to a pair of nodal points. For the moment let us call such boundary
components special pairs.
Deﬁnition 1.92 The parameters (ℓj
n,αj
n,Lk
n)1≤j≤r,1≤k≤s are called the Fenchel–
Nielsen parameters of the surface ˙Sn.
After passing to a suitable subsequence we may assume that
ℓj
n →ℓj > 0,
Lk
n →Lk ≥0,
αj
n →αj ∈R/Z.
Assume we have ordered the boundary components in such a way that
L1,...,Lk0 = 0 and Lk0+1,...,Ls > 0. We now assemble a hyperbolic surface ˙S
with genus g, with m −k0 boundary components and with μ + k0 punctures using
pairs of pants Y 1,...Y N with Fenchel–Nielsen parameters ℓ1,...,ℓr,α1,...,αr,
L1,...,Ls (see Proposition 1.52 and the remarks following it). Let S be the surface
obtained from ˙S by one-point-compactifying all the cusps.
The following series of ﬁgures serves as an illustration of this procedure. As an
example, the sequence Sn consists of tori with one boundary component and two
marked points (Fig. 1.36). Figure 1.37 depicts the surfaces ˙Sn and a pair of pants
decomposition which consists of three pants and three interior closed geodesics. We
assume now that the hyperbolic structures on ˙Sn behave as follows: We assume that

We return to the proof of Theorem 1.91. After having assembled the candidate
for the limiting surface S, we still have to show that the surfaces Sn converge to
S as in Deﬁnition 1.87. Recall that γ 1
n ,...,γ s
n and γ 1,...,γ s are the boundary
geodesics/punctures for ˙S and ˙Sn, respectively, and Lj = ℓ(γ j) = 0 if 1 ≤j ≤k0.
We would like to show the following: There is a sequence of continuous maps
ϕn : Sn →S with the following properties:
(1) ϕn(γ k
n ) = γ k for all n and 1 ≤k ≤s.

where ℓdenotes the length of the boundary component. Let Y be the pair of pants
with boundary components γ 1,γ 2,γ 3 such that ℓ(γ k) = Lk, k = 1,2,3. Finally,
let hn, h be the hyperbolic structures on Yn and Y, respectively. The construction is
organized into the following three steps: Fix a positive integer r.
Step 1: If L1,L2,L3 > 0 then there is a sequence of Cr-diffeomorphisms
φn : Y −→Yn
with φn(γ k) = γ k
n such that the sequence of metrics φ∗
nhn converges in
Cr−1 to the hyperbolic metric h on Y.
Step 2: Let κ := {k ∈{1,2,3}|Lk = 0} and assume that κ ̸= ∅, i.e. there are
boundary components which degenerate in the limit. Show that for any
0 < δ < sinh−1(1) there is a sequence of Cr-diffeomorphisms φn : Y →

sequences {ℓ(δk

for all n and that they converge to a nonzero limit (which we may assume
in view of (1.21)). Let {αn}n∈N be the corresponding sequence of twist pa-
rameters with limit α. Denote by (Xn,Hn) the hyperbolic surface obtained
by gluing Yn with Y ′
n along γ 1

n with twist parameter αn. Deﬁne similarly
(X,H) by gluing the limit pants Y,Y ′ along γ 1,δ1 with twist parameter α.

Once these three steps have been accomplished, it is not too hard anymore to
complete the proof of Theorem 1.91: We choose a sequence δm ↘0. We carry out
the construction of steps 1 and 2 for r = m and δ = δm. The resulting diffeomor-

1≤j≤k0 C(γ j,δm)) as n →∞. We then take a
diagonal sequence.
We will proceed with the arguments for steps 1–3. We recall that all the pants
Yn are obtained by gluing a hexagon Gn ⊂H together with a copy G′
n of itself
in the negative half-plane with complex structure −i. We denote the sides of the
hexagons Gn by a1
n,b1
n,a2
n,b2
n,a3
n,b3
n. We assume that all the sides of the hexagons
are parametrized on the interval [0,1] so that i ˙ak
n and i ˙bk
n point inwards (recall that
they have constant speed). Similarly, the pants Y is also obtained from a hexagon G
with sides a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3 and its ‘mirror image’ G′ (see Figs. 1.41 and 1.9).
After passing to a suitable subsequence and maybe renumbering the sides we may
assume that ℓ(b1
n) > 0 for all n. If all sides b1
n,b2
n,b3
n had lengths equal to zero
for large n then there would be nothing to prove because there is only one three-
punctured sphere up to isometry. In the case where ℓ(b1),ℓ(b2) and ℓ(b3) are all
nonzero, we use appropriate isometries of H to align all the hexagons Gn,G in such
a way that
b1(0) = b1
n(0) = i,
˙b1(0)
|˙b1(0)| =
˙b1

|˙b1n(0)| = 1

In Fig. 1.41 this means that we ﬁx the lower left vertices of the hexagons to the
point i, and the geodesics b1

that

n are uniquely determined by
their initial conditions a2
n(0) = b1
n(1), ˙a2
n(0) = i ˙b2
n(1), and they depend smoothly
on it.17 We then obtain convergence of the geodesics {a2
n} as well. The assertion
(1.22) follows from applying this argument consecutively to the other sides of the
hexagons Gn. We ﬁx now some integer r ≥1.

there is a sequence of Cr-diffeomorphisms φn : G →Gn with φn(bk) = bk

ak
n([0,1]),bk
n([0,1]) so that χn|∂G converges with all derivatives to the inclusion
∂G →H (meaning that there are smooth extensions to an open neighborhood of
∂G which converge with all derivatives). In order to do this we need to use (1.22)
and the fact that the hexagons are all right-angled so that the maps χn are also
well-behaved with respect to bk
n,bk. We then extend the maps χn to smooth maps
ˆχn : G →H with the additional property that supn ∥ˆχn∥Cr(G) < ∞. This can be
done because of a theorem in real analysis about the extension of smooth functions
across the boundary of their domains, also known as Whitney’s extension theo-
rem (see [66], Chap. VI.2, Theorem 4 or the original paper [79]). We remark that
the extension depends on the integer r. By the Ascoli–Arzela theorem the maps
ˆχn converge in Cr−1(G) (after passing to some subsequence) to some Cr−1-map
ˆχ : G →H (which then also depends on r). For large n the maps
φn : ˆχn −ˆχ + j : G −→H
are well-deﬁned, where j : G →H is the inclusion, and for x ∈∂G recalling that
ˆχ|∂G = j|∂G
φn(x) = χn(x) −ˆχ(x) + x = χn(x) ∈∂Gn.
Moreover, the sequence (φn)n∈N converges in Cr−1 to the inclusion j. We claim
that φn is injective for large n. Indeed, otherwise we could ﬁnd xn ̸= yn for each n

dashed curves are not
geodesics
which is a contradiction since ∥D( ˆχn −ˆχ)∥C0(G) →0. We claim that φn(G) = Gn.
We have H = Gn ∪(H\Gn). The compact set φn(G) lies in exactly one of the two
sets since φn is injective, it has boundary ∂Gn, so φn(G) = Gn and φn : G →Gn is a
Cr-diffeomorphism. If h is the usual hyperbolic metric on H then φ∗
nh|Gn converges
in Cr−1 to h|G. Since we used Fermi coordinates to construct the maps φn they ﬁt
together with their copies φ′
n : G′ →G′
n so that we obtain Cr-diffeomorphisms
Y →Yn which we again denote by φn. By deﬁnition of the hyperbolic met-
rics hn,h on the pants Yn and Y we also have φ∗

step 1.

1.3.3 Surfaces with Boundary
It not too difﬁcult to formulate a version of the Deligne Mumford result for Rie-
mann surfaces with boundary and possibly punctures and nodal pairs on the bound-
ary (see also Appendix B in [78] and [64]). The main idea is to double the surface.
We require that the doubled surface is stable so that it admits a Poincaré metric
and a pair of pants decomposition. We then apply the previous results keeping track
of the former boundary curve C which is a geodesic with respect to the Poincaré
metric on the doubled surface. Let S = (S,j,M,D,r,M∂,D∂) be a noded deco-
rated Riemann surface with nonempty boundary and the following pieces of ex-
tra data: We assume that M∂⊂∂S is a ﬁnite set (marked points on the bound-
ary), and we assume that D∂⊂∂S is another set of nodal pairs. Given an order-
ing of the boundary components of ∂S the orientation of the boundary then in-
duces a natural ordering of the set M∂. We used to compactify interior marked
points by adding a circle. As for boundary marked points, an arc is added (see
Fig. 1.47). It is not necessary to introduce the notion of decorations for bound-

ary
S#S′ =

S#S′,j#(−j),M ∪M′ ∪M∂,D ∪D′ ∪D∂,r,r′
together with an antiholomorphic involution σ : S#S′ →S#S′ which maps S onto
the copy S′, and with ﬁxed point set Fix(σ) = ∂S. Assume now we have a se-
quence {Sn} of such surfaces with boundary. In the deﬁnition of convergence (Def-
inition 1.87) we use the doubled surfaces, and we require that the diffeomorphisms
ϕn (acting between the doubled surfaces) commute with the corresponding invo-
lutions. Moreover, the images of the special arcs arising from nodal pairs on the
boundary are either special arcs or geodesic arcs which intersect ∂Sn precisely at
their endpoints. The former boundary curve C is a union of ﬁnitely many sim-
ple closed geodesic in the case where M∂∪D∂= ∅, i.e. when boundary marked
and nodal points are absent. Otherwise, its connected components are either sim-
ple closed geodesics or geodesics running from a neighborhood U of a point
p ∈M∂∪D∂into another. Note that each such neighborhood U looks like a
cusp, and U ∩C consists of two geodesics entering the cusp as in Fig. 1.48. By
Bers’ theorem (Theorem 1.69), the surfaces Sn#(Sn)′ admit a pair of pants de-
composition such that the lengths of the boundary components of the pants are
uniformly bounded. Formulating the result precisely would be very cumbersome.
We therefore study some examples to illustrate the relevant phenomena. As a ﬁrst
example, Fig. 1.49 shows a (Riemann) surface with genus 1, four boundary com-
ponents and one marked point. After decomposing its double into pairs of pants
and after assigning certain lengths to the boundary curves of the pants the surface
becomes a hyperbolic surface and therefore also a Riemann surface (the dashed

curves will later shrink to points). Figure 1.50 depicts its double. A pair of pants
decomposition is indicated by the dotted curves. We will assume in this example
that the boundary curves marked with an ‘X’ will shrink to a point. Figure 1.51
shows the limit surface. There are essentially three possible ways how the bound-
ary can degenerate: A whole boundary component can shrink to a point (type I),
a boundary component degenerates by pinching it together in ﬁnitely many points
(type II) or several different boundary components join together (type III), see also
Fig. 1.52. The pair of pants decomposition in Fig. 1.50 was created by cutting the
surface open along particularly simple closed geodesics. In general, simple closed

removed
curves (and geodesics) on the doubled surface can be quite complicated since they
may represent any non-trivial element in the fundamental group. It is very well
possible that a complicated curve such as in Fig. 1.53 is chosen by Bers’ result
since it may be the shortest one.19 After the doubled surface is cut open to cre-
ate a pair of pants decomposition the former boundary curve C consists of pair-
wise disjoint geodesic arcs on each pair of pants connecting one boundary com-
ponent to another (or to itself). It is also possible that the boundaries of the pairs
of pants contain connected components of C. V. Poénaru gave a classiﬁcation of
these ‘multiple arcs’ in [60]. Let P be a pair of pants with boundary components
∂1P,∂2P,∂3P . Following [60], we denote by A(P) the set isotopy classes of em-
bedded arcs I ⊂P with endpoints on ∂P such that I ∩∂P = ∂I and such that
I represents a non-trivial element in π1(P,∂P). The set A(P) consists of pre-
cisely six elements shown in Fig. 1.54. Similarly, we deﬁne A′(P) to be the set
19If S is a closed surface with non-separating simple closed curves γ1 and γ2 then there is a diffeo-
morphism φ : S →S which maps γ1 onto γ2. If γ2 is the minimal geodesic for some hyperbolic
metric h and an ‘easy’ curve while γ1 is complicated then γ1 will be the minimal geodesic for the
hyperbolic metric φ∗h.

Fig. 1.54 The space A(P )
of multiple such arcs which are pairwise disjoint. It is shown in [60] that they are
in 1–1 correspondence with triples of non-negative integers (m1,m2,m3) such that
m1 + m2 + m3 is even and not zero where mk represents the number of intersec-
tion points between the collection of arcs τ and the boundary component ∂kP . We
brieﬂy sketch part of the argument. Given a triple as above then it either satisﬁes the
triangle inequality, or one of the following three inequalities hold: m1 ≥m2 + m3,
m2 ≥m1 + m3 or m3 ≥m1 + m2. in the case where the triangle inequality holds we
set
x12 = m1 + m2 −m3
2
,
x23 = m2 + m3 −m1
2
,
x13 = m1 + m3 −m2
2
.
Let τ be the multiple arc which consists of xjk segments of type τjk as in Fig. 1.54.
If m1 ≥m2 + m3 we set
x11 = m1 −m2 −m3
2
,
x12 = m2,
x13 = m3.
The other cases handled similarly. Figure 1.55 shows some typical elements. If
a boundary component ∂kP of a pair of pants is degenerate because of a bound-
ary marked point or puncture then mk = 2. Moreover, hybrid pictures are possible
where a boundary curve of a pair of pants is a component of C (see the ﬁrst picture
in Fig. 1.55). Compared to Fig. 1.52 there is now a zoo of possible conﬁgurations
of the former boundary curve C on the pairs of pants. The only restriction is that
the curves ∂S separate the doubled surface. This does not change the way how C
degenerates: Either boundary components collapse to points or they pinch together
in ﬁnitely many points or several components of C join together in a point (or all of
the above).

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
2.1 Basic Deﬁnitions
In this section we will discuss a few constructions of almost complex manifolds
which will serve as targets for pseudoholomorphic curves. More general scenarios
are explained in the paper [12] in Sects. 2.1 and 3.2. Let us begin with the deﬁnition
of a pseudoholomorphic curve
Deﬁnition 2.1 Pseudoholomorphic curves (or J -holomorphic curves or simply
holomorphic curves) are maps u : S →W such that for all z ∈S
Du(z) ◦j(z) = J

u(z)

◦Du(z),
where
• S = (S,j) is a Riemann surface, i.e. S is a smooth 2-dimensional manifold to-
gether with a bundle isomorphism j : T S →T S such that j2 = −IdT S,
• W = (W,ω) is a symplectic manifold, i.e. W is a smooth manifold with a closed
nondegenerate 2-form ω (then W is even dimensional and ωn = ω ∧··· ∧ω is a
volume form on W),
• J is a compatible almost complex structure on W, i.e. J : T W →T W is a bundle
isomorphism with J 2 = −IdT W such that g = ω◦(Id×J) is a Riemannian metric
on W.
Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold serve as boundary conditions
for pseudoholomorphic curves with boundary
Deﬁnition 2.2 A Lagrangian submanifold of a 2n-dimensional symplectic mani-
fold W = (W,ω) is an n-dimensional submanifold L such that ω|T L ≡0.
We also need the notion of a contact manifold

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Deﬁnition 2.3
• A contact manifold is a (2n −1)-dimensional manifold M (n ≥2) together with
a 1-form λ such that λ ∧(dλ)n−1 is a volume form.
• A submanifold L ⊂M of a (2n −1)-dimensional manifold M with contact form
λ is called Legendrian if its dimension equals n −1 and if λ|T L ≡0.
• If (M,λ) is a contact manifold then the manifold W = R × M together with
the 2-form ω = d(etλ) is called the symplectization of M (as the name suggests,
(W,ω) is a symplectic manifold).
Exercise 2.4
(1) Show that there cannot be a symplectic form on an odd dimensional manifold.
(2) Let (M,λ) be a contact manifold and let φ : R →R be a smooth function.
Under which condition on φ is the 2-form d(φλ) a symplectic form on R × M?
(3) (Existence of compatible almost complex structures)
Let ω : R2n × R2n →R be a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form.
Show that there exists a linear map J : R2n →R2n such that J 2 = −Id and
such that
(v,w) →ω(v,Jw)
is a scalar product. Show that the space of such J ’s is contractible.
(4) Show that dλ|kerλ⊕kerλ is nondegenerate, i.e. if v ∈kerλp such that
dλp(v,w) = 0 for all w ∈kerλp then v = 0.
(5) Show that there is precisely one vector ﬁeld Xλ which satisﬁes the equations
iXλdλ ≡0,
iXλλ ≡1
and that T M = R · Xλ ⊕kerλ.
Deﬁnition 2.5 The vector ﬁeld Xλ is called the Reeb-vector ﬁeld of (M,λ).
Deﬁnition 2.6 An almost complex structure J on a manifold of the form R × V is
called cylindrical if it is invariant under translations, i.e. if J(t,x) = J(t + c,x) for
all t,c ∈R and x ∈V , and if the vector ﬁeld X := J ∂
∂t is horizontal, i.e. tangent to
the levels {t} × V , t ∈R.
If (R×V,J) is cylindrical then T (R×V ) splits into a direct sum of two complex
bundles, the trivial line bundle generated by ∂/∂t and the bundle ξ = T V ∩JT V .
The cylindrical structure J is called symmetric if the 1-form λ on V deﬁned by
iXλ ≡1,
λ|ξ ≡0
is preserved by the ﬂow of X, i.e. LXλ = 0. In view of the Cartan formula LX =
diX + iXd this is equivalent to iXdλ ≡0. In general, J itself is not preserved by the
ﬂow of X.

2.1
Basic Deﬁnitions
103
An important class of cylindrical almost complex structures are symplectizations
of a contact manifold M = (M,λ). If J : kerλ →kerλ is a bundle isomorphism
with J 2 = −Idξ then we deﬁne an almost complex structure ˜J on R×M as follows:
We simply set ˜JXλ = −∂
∂t and ˜J ∂
∂t = Xλ. This structure is symmetric because of
iXλdλ ≡0 and iXλλ ≡1 by deﬁnition of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld.
The tangent bundle of M splits T M = kerλ ⊕R · Xλ, and the hyperplane bundle
ξ := kerλ →M is called the contact structure associated to λ. We will write
πλ : T M = ξ ⊕R · Xλ −→ξ
for the projection onto ξ along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld. Note that multiplying a contact
form with a nowhere vanishing function yields again a contact form with the same
contact structure, but the Reeb-vector ﬁeld will be dramatically different.
We will always consider a particular type of almost complex structure on the
symplectization of a contact manifold:
Deﬁnition 2.7 Let (M,λ) be a contact manifold. A dλ-compatible complex struc-
ture on ξ = kerλ is a bundle automorphism J : ξ →ξ such that J 2 = −Id and such
that dλ ◦(Id×J) is a bundle metric on ξ.
We now deﬁne an almost complex structure ˜J on R×M as follows: We set ˜J ≡J
on ξ, and we deﬁne ˜JXλ := −∂
∂t , ˜J ∂
∂t := Xλ. More formally, if (a,u) ∈R × M and
(h,k) ∈T(a,u)(R × M) then
˜J(a,u)(h,k) :=

−λ(u)k,hXλ(u) + J(u)πλk

.
(2.1)
This almost complex structure does not depend on a, i.e. it is R-invariant. This
feature will be important later on.
Deﬁnition 2.8 A symplectic manifold with boundary is called a positive cylindrical
end or a negative cylindrical end if it is of the form [0,∞) × M or (−∞,0] × M
where M is a contact manifold, and if it is endowed with symplectic structure ω =
d(etλ) and almost complex structure ˜J as above.
Deﬁnition 2.9 Let (W,ω) be a symplectic manifold with boundary V . We say the
boundary is of contact type if there is a contact form λ on V such that ω|V = dλ
(we should rather write ω|T V ⊕T V = dλ).
We would like to ﬁnd a nice tubular neighborhood U of ∂W where the symplectic
form is under control. The proof of the following lemma is taken from [51]. The
result and related ones are probably due to Weinstein [77].
Lemma 2.10 (Prototype Darboux lemma)
Let W be a 2n-dimensional manifold
and let Q ⊂W be a compact submanifold. Moreover, let ω0,ω1 be closed 2-forms
on W with the following property: For every point q ∈Q and any pair of vectors
v,w ∈TqW we have ω0(q)(v,w) = ω1(q)(v,w), and ω0(q),ω1(q) are nondegen-

erate on TqW. Then there are open neighborhoods U0 and U1 of Q and a diffeo-
morphism ψ : U0 →U1 such that
ψ|Q = IdQ
and
ψ∗ω1 = ω0.
Proof We prove ﬁrst the following claim: There is a neighborhood U0 of Q and a
1-form σ on U0 such that
σ(q) = 0
for any q ∈Q and dσ = ω1 −ω0.
(2.2)
We pick any Riemannian metric on W and we consider the restriction of the expo-
nential map to the normal bundle T Q⊥of Q. We denote this map again by
exp : T Q⊥−→W.
We deﬁne now for ε > 0
Uε :=

(q,v) ∈T W |q ∈Q, v ∈T Q⊥, |v| < ε

.
Then the map
exp|Uε : Uε −→U0 := exp(Uε)
is a diffeomorphism if ε > 0 is sufﬁciently small, and we identify Q with {(q,0) ∈
Uε}. If t ∈[0,1] we deﬁne now
φt

exp(q,v)

:= exp(q,tv).
Then φt is a diffeomorphism for t > 0, and we have
φ0(U0) ⊂Q,
φ1 = IdU0,
φt|Q = IdQ.
Hence with τ = ω1 −ω0
φ∗
0τ = 0
and

q ∈Q and t ≥0 and since τq ≡0 we have σt(q,v) = 0 for any vector v ∈TqW.

t ∈[0,1].
We may assume that all the 2-forms ωt are nondegenerate by shrinking the neigh-
borhood U0 if necessary. We can then deﬁne a t-dependent vector ﬁeld Yt by the
equation
σ + iYt ωt = 0
and we note that Yt|Q = 0 for all t since σ|Q ≡0. By further shrinking U0 we may
assume that the ﬂow ψt exists for the interval t ∈[0,1]. Then

Remark 2.11
We remark that the above lemma also holds if W has nonempty
boundary and Q is a compact component of the boundary. We would have to re-
place Uε by the set U+
ε of all vectors normal to Q and pointing into the manifold W.
Moreover, we may assume that ψ is a global diffeomorphism W →W which sat-
isﬁes ψ(x) = x outside some neighborhood U2 of Q with ¯U0, ¯U1 ⊂U2. We can
accomplish this by using a cut-off function in order to make the vector ﬁeld Yt
equal to zero away from Q. Then let ψ be the time-1-map of this new vector ﬁeld.
In concrete situations, the main job before the lemma can be applied is to arrange
for ω0|Q,ω1|Q to agree.
Before we continue we note the following corollary of Lemma 2.10 which is
Darboux’ theorem:
Corollary 2.12 (Darboux’s theorem, symplectic case) Let (W,ω) be a (2n)-di-
mensional manifold. Then for every point p ∈W there is an open neighborhood U,
an open neighborhood V of the origin in R2n and a diffeomorphism φ : U →V
such that
φ∗

= ω.
Proof We ﬁrst take any local chart near p which maps p to the origin. Then ω
pulls back to some symplectic form ˜ω deﬁned on some open neighborhood of the
origin. After applying a linear isomorphism we may assume that ˜ω agrees with
"n
k=1 dqk ∧dpk at the origin. Choose Q = {0} in the Lemma 2.10.
□
There is an odd dimensional version of Darboux’s theorem.
Theorem 2.13 (Darboux’s theorem, contact case) Let (M,λ) and (N,τ) be contact
manifolds of dimension 2n + 1. Suppose p ∈M and q ∈N are given. Then there
exists a diffeomorphism ψ : U →V between open neighborhoods U of p and V of
q such that
ψ(p) = q,
and
ψ∗τ = λ.
Passing to local coordinates, we may conﬁne ourselves to the case where two
contact forms λ and τ are given on a neighborhood of zero in R2n+1. Of course we
may in addition assume that λ is the standard form on R2n+1.
Proof Let τ be a contact form in a neighborhood of the origin in R2n+1 with Reeb-
vector ﬁeld Xτ and let λ be the standard form with Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ = ∂
∂z. We
have
R2n+1 = R · Xτ(0) ⊕kerτ(0)

2.1

and dτ(0)|ker(τ(0))⊕ker(τ(0)) is a symplectic product. Then we can ﬁnd a basis
e1,...,en,f1,...,fn of ker(τ(0)) such that
dτ(0)(ei,ej) = dτ(0)(fi,fj) = 0,
dτ(0)(ei,fj) = δij
for all 1 ≤i,j ≤n.
Deﬁne a linear isomorphism A : R2n+1 −→R2n+1 by
∂

∂

A∗dτ

(0) = dλ(0) =

j=1

and
A · Xλ(0) = Xτ(0).
If we deﬁne τ ′ := A∗τ then the Reeb-vector ﬁelds of τ ′ and λ coincide in the origin.
Now we want to ﬁnd a local diffeomorphism u on some neighborhood of zero in
R2n+1 with u(0) = 0 such that u∗τ ′ and λ have the same Reeb-vector ﬁeld.
Let φt be the ﬂow of Xτ ′ and deﬁne
u(z,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn) := φz(0,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn).
Then

φt ◦u

(z,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn)
= φt+z(0,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn)

u ◦ψt

where ψt(z,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn) := (z + t,x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn) is the ﬂow of

because Xτ ′(0) = Xλ(0) = ∂

phism. Moreover

u∗τ ′

So τ ′′ := u∗τ ′ and λ are contact forms which have the same Reeb-vector ﬁeld. We
note that τ ′′ and λ resp. dτ ′′ and dλ coincide in the origin because of du(0) =
IdR2n+1.
Deﬁne τt := tτ ′′ + (1 −t)λ. Then

(0) = λ(0) ∧

dλ(0)

= ±dz ∧dx1 ∧··· ∧dxn ∧dy1 ∧··· ∧dyn.
Because of this we can ﬁnd a small neighborhood of zero such that the forms
τt ∧(dτt)n are volume forms for all t ∈[0,1], i.e. τt is a family of contact forms.
We calculate
iXλdτt = tiXλdτ ′′ + (1 −t)iXλdλ = 0,
iXλτt = tiXλτ ′′ + (1 −t)iXλλ = 1
and conclude that the Reeb-vector ﬁeld of each τt equals Xλ. Now deﬁne a time
dependent vector ﬁeld Yt by
iYt dτt = −d
dt τt = λ −τ ′′,
iYt τt = 0.
We remark that Yt would also be well-deﬁned if we did not align the Reeb-vector
ﬁelds of λ and τ ′′on a neighborhood of 0. But then we would have the identity
iYt dτt = λ −τ ′′ only on kerτt. Plugging in Xλ = Xτt = Xτ ′′ shows that the 1-forms
iYt dτt and λ −τ ′′ agree on all of R2n+1. The one parameter family (φt) generated

Moreover, it exists until time 1 since Yt(0) = 0 for all t. So φ∗

0λ = λ and
therefore φ∗τ = λ with φ = A◦u◦φ1. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.13. □
We note the following corollary:

Corollary 2.14 Let M be a (2n+1)-dimensional manifold equipped with a contact

Neighborhoods of symplectic and Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic
manifold are symplectomorphic. These are all corollaries of Lemma 2.10 (see
[51, 77] for more). We start with the case where Q is a contact type boundary (or
hypersurface). We will use Lemma 2.10 to prove the following:
Theorem 2.15 (Local structure near a contact type boundary and Liouville vector
ﬁelds)
Let (W,ω) be a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary (V,λ).
Then
• there is a diffeomorphism onto some neighborhood U of ∂W
φ : [−δ,0] × V −→U ⊂W
or
φ : [0,δ] × V −→U ⊂W
such that φ({0} × V ) = V and
φ∗ω = et(dλ + dt ∧λ) = d

etλ

.
• there is a vector ﬁeld Y (Liouville vector ﬁeld) deﬁned on a neighborhood U of
V such that Y is transverse to V and such that LY ω = d(iY ω) = ω.
Proof The second assertion easily follows from the ﬁrst: Let Y = φ∗∂

LY ω = d(iY ω) = d

Let Xλ be the Reeb-vector ﬁeld of λ. We claim that there is a vector ﬁeld X on W
such that for all v ∈V and Z a vector ﬁeld onV in kerλ
ωv

X(v),Xλ(v)

= 1
and
ωv

X(v),Z(v)

= 0.
By nondegeneracy of ω we can certainly satisfy the ﬁrst condition for some vector
ﬁeld X0 which must be transverse to V . We know that ω|T V ⊕T V = dλ and that
σ := dλ|kerλ⊕kerλ is nondegenerate. Then there is a unique vector ﬁeld X1 ∈kerλ
such that
iX1σ = −iX0ω|kerλ,
i.e. ωv(X0(v) + X1(v),ζ) = 0 for all v ∈V and ζ ∈kerλv. Then deﬁne X :=
X0 + X1 and extend it onto all of W. The vector ﬁeld X is still transverse to the
boundary. Whether it points inside or outside W depends on the contact form,

and we have no control over it. Consider now the map φ : [−δ,0] × V →W or
φ : [0,δ] × V →W given by
φ(t,x) := expx

tX(x)

which is a diffeomorphism onto its image. We have to choose −δ if X points outside,
and +δ if it points inside. We have

The 2-form Ω := et(dλ + dt ∧λ) is certainly a symplectic form on R × V , and it
agrees with φ∗ω on {0} × V . Invoking Lemma 2.10, we may now assume that there
is a diffeomorphism onto some neighborhood U of ∂W
φ : [−δ,0] × V −→U ⊂W
or
φ : [0,δ] × V −→U ⊂W
such that
φ∗ω = et(dλ + dt ∧λ)
completing the proof.

Let now (W,ω) be a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary ∂W = V .
We will discuss how to attach a positive or a negative cylindrical end to the boundary
of W. We carry out the procedure for a positive end, the construction for a negative
end is done in a similar way. Let U = [−δ,0] × V be a tubular neighborhood of
V ⊂W so that {0} × V corresponds to ∂W and by Theorem 2.15 we may assume
that the symplectic form is given by et(dλ + dt ∧λ). For 0 < ε < 1 we consider
smooth, monotone and concave functions (see Fig. 2.1)

where E+ := [0,+∞) × V and where Uε := [−ε,0] × V ⊂U. We recall that the
symplectic structure on Uε ∪E+ is given by et(dλ+dt ∧λ). We implant it with the
diffeomorphism Gε onto
◦
W. Outside some tubular neighborhood of the boundary it
will agree with the original symplectic structure.
There is another useful construction of manifolds with cylindrical ends, called
splitting (see [12]). Assume that W is a symplectic manifold which contains a con-
tact type hypersurface (V,λ). We cut W ′ open along V , and we obtain a symplectic
manifold W with contact type boundary V ′ ∪V ′′. If V divides W ′ then W may be
disconnected. As explained above we may then attach cylindrical ends to the newly
created boundary components:

For the sake of completeness we present versions of Darboux’s theorem for
neighborhoods of Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds.
Theorem 2.16 (Lagrangian neighborhood theorem) Let (W,ω) be a compact sym-
plectic manifold and let L ⊂W be a Lagrangian submanifold. Then there are neigh-
borhoods U ⊂T ∗L of the zero section, V ⊂W of L and a diffeomorphism
φ : U −→V
so that
φ∗ω = dθ
and
φ|L = id
where θ is the Liouville form and dθ is the canonical symplectic structure1 on T ∗L.
Proof Choose an almost complex structure J on T W which is compatible
with ω, i.e.
J : T W −→T W
J 2 = −Id

a diffeomorphism ψ between neighborhoods of the zero section in T ∗L with
ψ∗(φ∗ω) = dθ and ψ = Id on the zero section. This completes the proof.

We have a similar version of the Lagrange neighborhood theorem for Legendrian
submanifolds of a contact manifold.
Deﬁnition 2.17 A submanifold L of a (2n + 1)-dimensional contact manifold
(M,λ) is called a Legendrian submanifold if L is n-dimensional and everywhere
tangent to the contact hyperplanes, i.e. λ|T L ≡0.
Theorem 2.18 (Legendrian neighborhood theorem) Let (M,λ) be a (2n + 1)-di-
mensional contact manifold and let L be a Legendrian submanifold, i.e. dimL = n
and λ|T L ≡0. Then there is a neighborhood U of L in M and a diffeomorphism
Ψ : R × T ∗L 
−→U
so that Ψ ∗λ = λ0 := dt + θ, where t is the coordinate in R and θ is the canonical
1-form on T ∗L.
Proof The proof of the theorem consists of the following three steps:
Step 1: Find a diffeomorphism φ : R × T ∗L )
→U so that

φ∗λ

(0,0p) = (dt + θ)(0,0p),
φ(0,0p) = p and (φ∗dλ)(0,0p) = dθ(0,0p) for all p ∈L where 0p ∈T ∗
p L is the
zero section.
Step 2: Further modify the contact form in a neighborhood of L so that its Reeb-
vector ﬁeld equals ∂
∂t .
Step 3: Use the Moser technique in order to ﬁnd the desired diffeomorphism Ψ .
Let us start with Step 1: We have a splitting T M = R · Xλ ⊕ξ, ξ = kerλ, and dλ
is nondegenerate on ξ. Pick J : ξ →ξ so that J 2 = −Id and gJ = dλ ◦(Id×J) is
a bundle metric on ξ. Since dλ(v,w) = v(λ(w)) −w(λ(v)) −λ([v,w]) we see that
for all p ∈L, the vector space J(p)TpL is the orthogonal complement of TpL in ξ
with respect to gJ . We write JT L = T L⊥.
We continue each v∗
p ∈T ∗
p L onto all of ξp by requiring v∗
p|JpTpL ≡0 and view
v∗
p as an element in the dual space of ξp. Since dλ(p) is nondegenerate on ξp, there
is exactly one element Φ(v∗
p) ∈ξp so that

and consider the following metric on M:
⟨v,w⟩:= λ(p)v · λ(p)w + gJ (p)(πλv,πλw),
where p ∈M and v,w ∈TpM. The orthogonal complement T L⊥of T L with re-
spect to this metric is R · Xλ ⊕JT L. We use ˜Φ above to construct a tubular neigh-
borhood of L ⊂M as follows:
φ := exp◦˜Φ : R × T ∗L ⊃I × U −→V ⊂M,
where I is an open interval centered at 0 and U is an open neighborhood of the
zero-section in T ∗L. We see immediately that
φ(0,0p) = p
where 0p ∈T ∗
p L is the zero vector.
Let us compute the derivative of φ at (0,0p) for p ∈L. We can decompose each

where γ0 is a curve in L with γ0(0) = p, ˙γ0(0) = v0 and γ1 is a curve in T ∗

We are now in the following situation: Our contact manifold is I ×U ⊂R×T ∗L
with contact form ˜λ so that
˜λ(0,0p) = dt + θ(0p) = dt
and
d ˜λ(0,0p) = dθ(0p),
in particular
X˜λ(0,0p) = ∂

Step 2: Find a diffeomorphism φ deﬁned near {0} × L ⊂R × T ∗L so that
φ(0,0p) = (0,0p),
dφ(0,0p) = Id
for all p ∈L and
dφ(a,v) · ∂

for sufﬁciently small ε > 0. Then the Reeb-vector ﬁeld X˜λ is transverse to H
along L. Choosing ε small enough, we may assume that X˜λ is transverse to H
everywhere. For (t,v) ∈R × T ∗L with (0,v) ∈H and |t| small, we may deﬁne a
diffeomorphism φ near L by requiring:
φ(t,v) = ψt(0,v),
where ψt denotes the ﬂow of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld X˜λ. The map φ has the desired
properties, which completes step 2.

λt = t ˜λ + (1 −t)λ0,
t ∈[0,1].
These are all contact forms and they coincide on L. Moreover their Reeb-vector
ﬁelds coincide near L by step 2 above. Deﬁne a time dependent vector ﬁeld Yt by
iYt λt = 0
and
iYt dλt = −dλt
dt = λ0 −˜λ.
We note that Yt|L ≡0, hence the ﬂow φt of Yt exists until time 1 near L. Then

2.2 Asymptotic Behavior Near a Puncture
2.2.1 Introduction
In this section we will study the asymptotic behavior of a pseudoholomorphic curve
in a cylindrical manifold near punctures on its domain. We start in this section with
the easiest case where the domain is the complex plane, i.e. a sphere with one punc-
ture. We will also discuss the simplest case for curves with boundary, namely the
case of a disk with precisely one boundary puncture. We will revisit the case of an
arbitrary punctured Riemann surface later after having discussed the Monotonicity
Lemma.
Let M be a manifold equipped with a contact form λ, denote by ξ →M the
associated contact structure and by Xλ the associated Reeb-vector ﬁeld. Let us ﬁx

any complex structure J : ξ →ξ compatible with dλ|(ξ ⊕ξ) in the sense that
gJ (x)(h,k) := dλ

h,J(x)k

deﬁnes a metric on the bundle ξ →M (we will write |h|J := gJ (h,h)1/2). There
are plenty of these complex structures as the following lemma shows:2
Lemma 2.19
The set J of smooth complex structures on ξ = kerλ as speciﬁed
above is a nonempty contractible space for the C∞-topology.
Proof We can associate an element J ∈J to any metric ⟨·,·⟩on ξ as follows: Write
ω = ⟨·,A·⟩where A is a section in the bundle End(ξ). Deﬁne AT by ⟨AT ·,·⟩=
⟨·,A·⟩. Because ω is nondegenerate and skew-symmetric we have A = −AT and
⟨x,AT Ax⟩> 0 ⇐⇒x ̸= 0. One can deﬁne
√
AT A =
√
−A2, and
√
−A2 is again
symmetric and positive deﬁnite (see the remark below for more details). Moreover
√
−A2 commutes with A and A−1. Now deﬁne J := A−1√
−A2 and we see that
J ∈J . Pick J0 ∈J and write gJ0 := ω ◦(Id×J0). For each J ∈J
gt := tgJ0 + (1 −t)gJ := tgJ0 + (1 −t)

ω ◦(Id×J)

is again a metric, i.e. ω = gt(·,At·) with At = (tJ0 + (1 −t)J)−1. Now we deﬁne
H : [0,1] × J −→J
H(t,J) := A−1
t

−A2t
and see that
H(0,·) = IdJ
H(1,·) ≡J0.
Obviously H is continuous in the C∞-topology.
□
Remark 2.20 Here is a rather unusual way to deﬁne
√
−A2. It utilizes the so-called
Dunford–Taylor integral, a generalization of the Cauchy integral formula, and has
a much wider scope than the application we have in mind. Assume that T ∈Cn×n.
Let Ω ⊂C be an open domain with one boundary component such that σ(T ) ⊂Ω,
where σ(T ) denotes the spectrum of T . We orient ∂Ω positively. Let φ : Ω →C be
holomorphic. Then we deﬁne the linear map
φ(T ) := −1
2πi

∂Ω
φ(ζ)(ζ · Id−T )−1 dζ.
2In the same way one can prove the more familiar statement that the space of all almost complex
structures on a symplectic manifold compatible with the symplectic structure is nonempty and
contractible.

2.2

Note ﬁrst that ζ ·Id−T is indeed invertible because σ(T )∩∂Ω = ∅by assumption.
Show as an exercise that the above integral converges and that is satisﬁes
(φ1φ2)(T ) = φ1(T ) ◦φ2(T )
and
(φ1 ◦φ2)(T ) = φ1(T ) ◦φ2(T ).
φ(ζ) =
N

k=0

⇒
φ(T ) =

k=0
akT k.
Applied to our situation, T = −A2 and σ(T ) ⊂[a,b] ⊂R for some a > 0, and A
depends smoothly on x ∈W. If we consider only x inside some (small) open set
then we may assume that T −1 exists for all x, and we may choose a domain Ω not
containing (−∞,0] so that all eigenvalues are contained in Ω for all x. Choosing
φ(ζ) = √ζ which is holomorphic since we avoid (−∞,0], we can then make sense
out of
√
T using the above integral formula, and
√
T will depend smoothly on x as
well.
Let ˜J be the associated almost complex structure on R × M deﬁned by
˜J(a,u)(h,k) :=

−λ(u)k,J(u)πλk + hXλ(u)


g ˜J


:= h1h2 + λ(k1)λ(k2) + gJ (πλk1,πλk2),
where πλ : T M −→ξ is the projection along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ.
We study solutions of
˜u = (a,u): C −→R × M
˜us + ˜J(˜u)˜ut = 0

E(˜u) = sup
ϕ∈Σ

˜u∗d(ϕλ)
(2.6)
and Σ = {ϕ ∈C∞(R,[0,1]) | ϕ′ ≥0}. The motivation for the deﬁnition in (2.6) is
the following: Given a holomorphic curve ˜u = (a,u) and a sequence ck →−∞we
consider the sequence of holomorphic curves ˜uk = (a + ck,u). Then

C
˜u∗
kd(ϕλ) −→0
while E(˜uk) = E(˜u). If we remove the supremum from the deﬁnition of the energy
in (2.6) then the energy could be close to zero, but the holomorphic curve is far from
constant.

where i ∂

The following theorem is due to Hofer [33]:

As announced before, a similar result exists for nontrivial ﬁnite-energy curves on
a general punctured Riemann surface. We will consider it later since it requires more
advanced methods to prove. We begin by deriving estimates for the linear Cauchy
Riemann operator which we will use to prove regularity estimates for the nonlinear
Cauchy Riemann operator. Using this, we will prove under quite general assump-
tions that a uniform gradient bound for a family of J -holomorphic maps implies uni-
form C∞-bounds. Figure 2.3 visualizes the map ˜u of Theorem 2.21 (in a rather naive
way) which we will call a ﬁnite-energy plane. The ﬁnite-energy plane approaches
asymptotically the cylinder (s,t) −→(s,x(t)) ∈R×M over a periodic orbit x. The
reader easily veriﬁes that the map ˜v : (s,t) −→(s,x(t)) is a pseudoholomorphic

idealistic case where there is convergence for all sequences Rk →+∞, i.e. there is
only one asymptotic limit ˜v. This actually happens if the periodic orbit x is isolated
among all T-periodic orbits of Xλ (we will prove this later). After the discussion of
ﬁnite-energy planes we will consider ﬁnite-energy half-planes (i.e. disks with one
boundary puncture) with suitable boundary conditions.
2.2.2 Estimates for the Linear Cauchy Riemann Operator
Let z = (z1,...,zn) be the usual coordinates on Cn. Write zj = qj + ipj. The stan-
dard symplectic form ω on Cn is by deﬁnition
ω =

k=1
dqk ∧dpk.
If (η,τ) := "n
j=1 ηj ¯τj is the Hermitian inner product on Cn we denote by ⟨·,·⟩:=
Re(·,·) the real inner product. We have the following formula:
ω(η,τ) = ⟨iη,τ⟩.
Assume φ : C →Cn is a compactly supported smooth map. Since ω = dλ for a suit-
able 1-form λ we see that by Stokes’ Theorem applied on a large ball BR containing
supp(φ)

C
φ∗ω =

φ∗λ = 0.
Observe that
φ∗ω = ω(φs,φt)ds ∧dt = ⟨iφs,φt⟩ds ∧dt.

Then we compute with ¯∂= ∂
∂s + i ∂
∂t
|¯∂φ|2 = |φs + iφt|2
= |φs|2 + |φt|2 + 2Re(φs,iφt)
= |φs|2 + |φt|2 + 2⟨φs,iφt⟩
= |φs|2 + |φt|2 −2⟨iφs,φt⟩,
which implies that
|¯∂φ|2 ds ∧dt =

|φs|2 + |φt|2
ds ∧dt −2φ∗ω.
Integrating this equality over C yields

Combining (2.7) and (2.8) yields the following estimate for φ ∈C∞
0 (BR,Cn), i.e. a
smooth function φ : BR →Cn with compact support in
◦
BR (0):
∥φs∥2

L2(C) + ∥φ∥2
L2(C) ≤

4R2 + 1

∥¯∂φ∥2
L2(C).
For 1 ≤p < ∞and Ω a domain in C we introduce the notation
∥φ∥W 1,p(Ω) := ∥φ∥1,p,Ω :=
*
∥φs∥p
Lp(Ω) + ∥φt∥p
Lp(Ω) + ∥φ∥p
Lp(Ω)
+1/p,
which is one of the well-known Sobolev-norms. We summarize our discussion as
follows:
Theorem 2.22 For every φ ∈C∞
0 (BR,Cn) we have the estimate
∥φ∥2
1,2,C ≤

4R2 + 1

∥¯∂φ∥2
0,2,C
where ∥∥0,2,C is the usual L2-norm on C.
The same estimates remain true if ‘2’ is replaced by 1 < p < ∞and 4R2 + 1 by
a different constant.
Theorem 2.23 Given 1 < p < ∞, there exists a constant c = c(p,R) > 1, mono-
tone increasing in R, such that for every φ ∈C∞
0 (BR,Cn) we have the estimate
∥φ∥1,p,C ≤c∥¯∂φ∥0,p,C.
This result is much harder to prove. It requires Calderón–Zygmund theory, and
we refer the reader to [66].
Remark 2.24 If we consider derivatives of φ one gets easily
∥φ∥k,p,C ≤c∥¯∂φ∥k−1,p,C
for any integer k.
We will examine how the constant c in Theorem 2.23 depends on the support of
the function under consideration. Assume φ : C →Cn is any smooth function with
compact support in the open unit disk B1 = B1(0). Theorem 2.23 asserts that there
is a constant c = cp > 0 such that
∥φ∥1,p,C ≤c∥¯∂φ∥0,p,C.
If now v : C →Cn is a smooth function with compact support in the open disk Br
of radius r > 1 then we get with φ(z) := v(rz)
∥v∥1,p,C = ∥v∥Lp(C) + ∥∇v∥Lp(C)

124

2
p −1∥∇φ∥Lp(C)
≤cpr
2
p ∥¯∂φ∥0,p,C
= cpr∥¯∂v∥0,p,C.
Hence the constant in the estimate ∥φ∥1,p,C ≤c∥¯∂φ∥0,p,C increases linearly with r.
It is easy to extend Theorem 2.23 above to maps φ on the upper half-plane3
H + = {z|Im(z) ≥0} ⊂C. If we take φ : H + →Cn with compact support and
φ(R) ⊂Rn then we can extend it to the full plane C by
˜φ(s,t) :=

φ(s,t)
for t ≥0
φ(s,−t)
for t < 0.
The t-derivatives of φ|H + and φ|H −do not match along R but we have
|¯∂φ|∂H +|2 = |¯∂φ|∂H −|2.
As before we get now estimates for ˜φ on the full plane C but the Lp-norm on C
is just twice the Lp-norm on H +. We summarize:
Theorem 2.25 Deﬁne H + := {z ∈C| Im(z) ≥0} and let p ∈(1,∞).
Then there exists a constant c > 0 such that
∥φ∥1,p,H + ≤c∥∂φ∥Lp(H +)
for all smooth φ : H + −→Cn with compact support in H + and
φ(H + ∩R) ⊂Rn.
The constant c depends on p and the support of φ (in the same fashion as in the
non-boundary case).
In the following section we will use Theorems 2.23 and 2.25 to derive the regu-
larity estimates for the nonlinear Cauchy Riemann operator.
2.2.3 Regularity: Gradient Bounds Imply C∞-Bounds
Let W be any 2n-dimensional manifold equipped with an almost complex struc-
ture J . Denote by K ⊂W a compact subset. We will be interested mainly in
3Note that our notation is slightly inconsistent here: In this chapter we use the notation H + for
the closed upper half-plane since we will consider boundary conditions. In the previous chapter on
hyperbolic geometry we used the same notation for the open upper half-plane.

2.2
Asymptotic Behavior Near a Puncture
125
W = R × M, where M is a closed contact manifold, hence we may assume by
Whitney’s embedding theorem that W ⊂RN for some sufﬁciently large N. So any
map u: C →W may be viewed as a map into RN. We will take advantage of that
because we will consider Sobolev spaces W l,p(Ω,RN) and use the linear structure
of RN. Let us introduce the following notation for the derivatives of u: Write Dαu,
where
Dα =
 ∂
∂s
α1 ∂
∂t
α2
,
α = (α1,α2) ∈N2, |α| := α1 + α2.
Let Γ = Γ (c,K) be a set of smooth solutions of
u: D −→W
us + J(u)ut = 0
on D,
where D ⊂C is the open unit disk, such that
sup
z∈D
∇u(z)
 ≤c
and
u(D) ⊂K.
The crucial estimate is the following:
Proposition 2.26 Let 2 < p < ∞. Given any δ ∈(0,1) and l ∈N, then there exists
a constant d > 0 depending on l,p,c,δ, and K, such that
sup
u∈Γ (c,K)
∥u∥l,p,Bδ(0) ≤d.
Remark 2.27 The consequence of this result is the following: If there is a uniform
C1-bound on a set of solutions u of the nonlinear Cauchy Riemann equation then
this implies a uniform C∞
loc bound for all u in this set, i.e. for each integer k ≥1
and each compact set K there is a u-uniform bound in Ck(K). Hence if a set of
solutions of the nonlinear Cauchy Riemann equation fails to be compact in the C∞
loc-
topology then the reason for that must be the lack of a C1-bound; existence of a
uniform C0-bound would then reduce the phenomenon of non-compactness to the
explosion of the gradient in the C0-norm (’bubbling off’). The reason why we are
using Sobolev-norms here while actually dealing with smooth functions is that there
are regularity estimates for the Cauchy Riemann operator in those norms in contrast
to the Ck-norms.
We ﬁrst mention some facts about Sobolev spaces which we leave as exercises
(try the second assertion for m = 1):
Lemma 2.28
• Let Ω ⊂Rn be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. Moreover let
1 ≤p < ∞and m ∈N so that mp > n.

126
2
Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Then W m,p(Ω) is a Banach algebra, i.e. multiplication (u,v) −→uv is a
continuous bilinear map into W m,p(Ω) and there is a constant c > 0 such that
∥uv∥m,p,Ω ≤c∥u∥m,p,Ω∥v∥m,p,Ω.
• Let Ω ⊂Rn be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and u ∈W m,p(Ω,Rl)
with mp > n. Moreover let f ∈C∞(Rl,Rk) with bounded derivatives up to or-
der m. Then f ◦u ∈W m,p(Ω,Rk) and there is a constant c > 0 so that
		f ◦u −f (0)
		
m,p,Ω ≤c∥u∥m,p,Ω
for all u ∈W m,p(Ω).
We will now prove Proposition 2.26.
Proof For l = 0 and l = 1 the result is true by deﬁnition of the set Γ (c,K). So
assume it has been proved for l ≥1. By induction we will show that it is true for
l + 1. In order to prove the proposition it is actually sufﬁcient to show that every
sequence (uk) in Γ (c,K) has a subsequence which is bounded in the W l+1,p-norm.
Fix some number δ′ ∈(δ,1) and let (uk)k∈N be any sequence in Γ (c,K).
Since ∥uk∥1,p,Bδ′(0) ≤cδ′ for some constant cδ′ > 0 not depending on k, we may
assume by the compact embedding

Bδ′(0),RN

Bδ′(0),RN
that
uk −→u

Bδ′(0),RN
after taking a subsequence (this is the so-called Rellich–Kondrachov compactness
theorem). This implies in particular that the map u has image in W as well. For
every x0 ∈Bδ(0) we ﬁnd 0 < ε0 < δ′ −δ, an open neighborhood U ⊂W of u(x0)
and a coordinate chart
ϕ : U

with ϕ(u(x0)) = 0 such that

on Bε0(x0). It is sufﬁcient to prove that the sequence (vk)k∈N is bounded in
W l+1,p(Bε(x0),R2n) for some ε ∈(0,ε0]. Indeed, composing vk with ϕ−1 and
using the fact that composition with a smooth function preserves the Sobolev-
class, we would obtain the result that the sequence (uk)k∈N is bounded in
W l+1,p(Bε(x0),RN) as well. Since we can cover Bδ(0) by ﬁnitely many of these
balls Bε(x0) we will obtain the desired result. The reasons why we had to squeeze
all the sets uk(Bε(x0)) into a single coordinate chart U of W are the following: First,
we will compare the Sobolev norm of J(uk) with the one of uk, i.e. we will use the
fact that composition with a smooth function is a continuous map from a Sobolev
space onto itself, and we will use that in local coordinates J may be viewed as a
smooth map ϕ(U) →GL(R2n). Second, we have to compare the nonlinear Cauchy
Riemann operator with the standard linear one, for which we have estimates. We will
need the fact that J(uk(x)) does not differ much from the constant J(u(x0)) ≈i if
x is close to x0.
Summing up, we have arrived at the following situation
vk : Bε0(x0) −→Cn,
∂svk + ˆJ(vk)∂tvk = 0,
vk(x0) −→0
since uk(x0) →u(x0),
the sequence (vk)k∈N converges in C0(Bε0(x0),Cn) to some v and

By the Sobolev embedding theorem we have a (compact) embedding
W k+1,p(Ω) →Ck( ¯Ω)
where Ω is any bounded 2-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary and 2 <
p < ∞. Hence the previous result gives us bounds for the Ck-Norms:
Theorem 2.29 Given any δ ∈(0,1) and l ∈N, there exists a constant d′ depending
on l,c,δ and K such that
∥u∥Cl(Bδ(0)) ≤d′
for every u ∈Γ (c,K).
We would like to apply these results to the case W = R×M where M is a closed
(2n + 1)-dimensional manifold with contact form λ (or R2n+1). Let ξ →M be
the associated contact structure and J : ξ →ξ a complex multiplication compatible
with dλ. As before denote by ˜J the associated almost complex structure on R × M.
For K ⊂M being a compact subset and c > 0 we are interested in sets of the
form

Observe that if ˜u = (a,u) ∈Γ ′(c,K) then also ˜uτ = (a + τ,u) ∈Γ ′(c,K),
where τ ∈R). For this reason there cannot be any uniform C0-bound for ˜u if
Γ ′(c,K) ̸= ∅. Nevertheless, the following is true.
Theorem 2.30
Given δ ∈(0,1) and α ∈N2 with |α| ≥1 then there exists a con-
stant d = d(c,K,α,δ) > 0 such that
		Dα ˜u
		
C0(Bδ(0)) ≤d
for all ˜u ∈Γ ′(c,K).
Proof For every |α| ≥1 we have
		Dα ˜uτ
		
C0 =
		Dα ˜u
		
C0.
So we only need to consider the subset Γ ∗(c,K) of Γ ′(c,K) consisting of all ˜u =
(a,u) with
a(0) = 0.
Since we have the uniform gradient bound (2.13), we obtain a C0-bound for
Γ ∗(c,K). Now apply Theorem 2.29 to the set Γ ∗(c,K).
□
Proposition 2.26 also holds near a boundary point if the pseudoholomorphic
curve satisﬁes a totally real boundary condition. Here are the relevant deﬁnitions:
Let (W,J) be an almost complex manifold, i.e. J is a section in End(T W) with
J 2 = −Id. Let D ⊂C be the open unit disk, and let D+ = D ∩H + be its upper
half. We would like to study pseudoholomorphic curves on D+, i.e. maps satisfying
u : D −→W
¯∂J u(z) := us(z) + J

u(z)

ut(z) = 0
on D+,
(2.14)
from the local point of view. Moreover, we will assume that the following boundary
condition holds:
u

∂D+
:= u(R ∩D) ⊂F,
where F ⊂W is a totally real submanifold, i.e.
TxF ⊕J(x)TxF = TxW
for all x ∈F .
Exercise 2.31 We identify the complex vector space (Cn,i) with R2n. Show the
following: A subspace V ⊂(R2n,i) is totally real (i.e. R2n = V ⊕iV ) if and only
if there is

We are only concerned with local studies near some boundary point z0, hence
we pass to local coordinates. We choose a chart σ : U →V ⊂Cn, where U is a
neighborhood of u(z0) in W so that
σ(F ∩V ) = Rn ∩U
and σ(u(z0)) = 0. Deﬁne an almost complex structure ¯J on U by
¯J(w) := T σ



ψε(z) := z0
i −εz
i + εz;
ε > 0
maps the upper half-disk D+ onto a neighborhood of z0. Choose ε > 0 sufﬁciently
small so that v := σ ◦u ◦ψε : D+ →U ⊂Cn is well-deﬁned. The above exercise
implies that there is a real linear map A : R2n →R2n with A ¯J(0)A−1 = i and A ·
Rn = Rn, i.e. after composing with A we may assume that ¯J(0) = i, and we did
not disturb the boundary condition Rn. Summarizing, we have now arranged the
following situation:4

v(0) = 0,
¯J(0) = i.
(2.15)
We can then reprove Proposition 2.26 with disks replaced by half-disks using the
linear estimate Theorem 2.25.
When we proved Proposition 2.26 we were primarily concerned about the fact
that uniform C1-bounds imply uniform C∞
loc-bounds, but we actually proved more
than this. Elaborating a bit more on inequality (2.9) we obtain a regularity estimate
which we want to expose more explicitly.
We introduce the following notation:
• 2 < p < ∞,
• 0 < ε′ < ε < δ, and β = βε,ε′ : C →[0,1] is a smooth function with compact
support in the open disk Bε = Bε(0) and β|Bε′ ≡1,
• c = c(ε,p) > 0 is the constant from the linear estimate, Theorem 2.23. It is con-
tinuous and monotone increasing in ε, and
4If we want furthermore ¯J ≡i on Rn ∩U then we may arrange this at the expense of having an
additional zero order term of the form C(z) · v(z) in the equation for v in (2.15).

• u : Bδ →Cn is a J -holomorphic disk with u(0) = 0 where J is an almost com-
plex structure on Cn such that J(0) = i. We only consider J -holomorphic disks

Examining inequality (2.9) we obtain the following estimate:

We recover our earlier result that a uniform C1-bound on pseudoholomorphic curves
implies a C∞
loc-bound. We also see that (2.18) is not useful in the absence of a uni-
form C1-bound.
Proposition 2.32 (Interior regularity estimate for the nonlinear Cauchy Riemann
operator)
Let u : Bδ →W be a smooth map where (W,J) is an almost complex
manifold equipped with some Riemannian metric. Assume that the image of u lies
in some compact set C ⊂W, and assume that ∥Du∥L∞(Bδ) ≤K for some constant
K > 0 and p > 2. Let 0 < δ′ < δ. Then for every integer l ≥0 there exists a constant
c > 0, depending only on l,J,C,K,p,δ′,δ but not on u such that
∥u∥l+1,p,Bδ′ ≤c

Before we start with the proof we recall the concept of a Lebesgue number
Deﬁnition 2.33 Let (X,d) be a metric space. A number a > 0 is called the
Lebesgue number of an open cover {Gi}1≤i≤m of X if for each subset Y ⊂X with
diameter less or equal a there is 1 ≤j ≤m with Y ⊂Gj, and a is the largest number
for which this statement holds.
Lemma 2.34
If the metric space X is compact then every open cover has a
Lebesgue number.
Proof Let us call a set A ⊂X large if it is not contained in any of the sets Gi. Deﬁne
a′ := inf

diam(Y)|Y is large

.
We have to show that a′ > 0. So assume that a′ = 0. Let us pick a sequence of
large sets Yn with 0 < diam(Yn) < 1
n and choose xn ∈Yn. Since X is sequentially
compact, we may assume that xn →x ∈X after passing to a subsequence. We have
x ∈Gi0 for some i0. The sets Gi are all open, hence there exists a ball Br(x) which
is contained in Gi0 and a number N so that xn ∈Br/2(x) whenever n ≥N. Choosing
N so that N > 2
r , we conclude
Yn ⊂Br(x) ⊂Gi0
for n ≥N large enough in contradiction to the assumption that Yn is large.
□
We can now begin with the proof of Proposition 2.32.
Proof Let {ψk} be a ﬁnite number of coordinate charts which cover C. For every
x0 ∈Bδ′ we pick a ball Bε0(x0) such that u(Bε0(x0)) lies in one of these coordinate
charts.5 We also ask for ε ≤(2c∥DJ∥L∞(C)K)−1, where κ > 0 is a suitable con-
stant only depending on the collection of coordinate charts {ψk}, so that (2.17) holds
5We remark that there is such an ε0 which does not depend on u. Indeed, there is a number τ > 0
such that any set in C of diameter less or equal than τ lies in one of the coordinate charts. Take

134

for any composition of u with any of the coordinate maps, and this choice is inde-
pendent of the particular map u. We then cover the ball Bδ′ with ﬁnitely many of the
balls {Bε0/2(x0)|x0 ∈Bδ′}. On each of these balls we can apply the estimate (2.17).
Then we obtain the proposition from the individual pieces on the ε0/2-balls (details
as an exercise).
□
Remark 2.35
Inequality (2.18) and Proposition 2.32 also hold if the disks are
replaced with half-disks provided the J -holomorphic map satisﬁes a totally real
boundary condition.6
2.2.4 Behavior Near an Interior Puncture
The aim of this section is to present the proof of Theorem 2.21. As before, let M be
a manifold with contact form λ and associated contact structure ξ. Let πλ : T M →
ξ be the projection along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ. Again we ﬁx any compatible
complex structure J : ξ →ξ for the contact structure ξ →M and we study the
solutions of

K ⊂M such that
u(C) ⊂K.

2K so that |u(x) −
u(y)| ≤K|x −y| ≤2Kε0 = τ.
6Inequality (2.18) is the central piece of the Fredholm theory of the nonlinear Cauchy Riemann
operator. Hence curves with boundary only lead to a Fredholm problem if they satisfy a totally real
boundary condition.

2.2

Proposition 2.36 Let ˜u: C →R × M solve (2.19). Assume moreover that

C
u∗dλ = 0
and
E(˜u) < +∞.
Then ˜u is constant.
Before we start with the proof we note the following corollary:
Corollary 2.37 Let ˜u : C →R × M be a nonconstant solution of (2.19) with ﬁnite
energy E(˜u). Then

C
u∗dλ > 0.
The pseudoholomorphic plane (s,t) −→(s,x(t)), with x being any trajectory
of Xλ, shows that the assumption of ﬁnite energy in Proposition 2.36 cannot be
dropped.
Remark 2.38 In the above corollary the dλ-energy of any nonconstant solution
of (2.19) with ﬁnite energy is bounded from below by
ℵ:= inf{T > 0|∃T -periodic orbit of Xλ inside K}.
This follows from Theorem 2.21 (once the proof is complete of course). We have
ℵ> 0 since otherwise there would be a periodic orbit contained in a Darboux chart
which is of course nonsense.
We proceed with the proof of Proposition 2.36.
Proof We know that

This means precisely that |πλus|2
J = |πλut|2
J = 0 or u∗dλ = 0. Hence
πλ ◦Du(z) : C →ξu(z)
is the zero map for every z ∈C which means that ∂su and ∂tu are both parallel
to Xλ(u):
∂su =

λ(u)∂su

Xλ(u),
∂tu =

λ(u)∂tu

Xλ(u).
The 1-form u∗λ on C is closed and therefore exact, hence there is a function f on C
so that df = u∗λ. We recall that also u∗λ = −da ◦i which is part of the nonlinear

Cauchy Riemann equation. Now df = −da ◦i is equivalent to the function Φ =
a + if : C →C being holomorphic. In particular, the function a is harmonic.
Consider the 2-form τ on C deﬁned by

Φ∗τ ≤c < +∞
for all φ ∈Σ. Let us summarize what has happened so far. The derivative fs is just
the component of ∂su along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld, similarly for the t-derivative. If
we view f as a map of C into the 1-dimensional contact manifold R with contact
form dt (t being the coordinate on R) and Reeb-vector ﬁeld d
dt then Φ can be viewed
as a ‘pseudo’ holomorphic plane in the symplectization (R × R ≈C,τ) of (R,dt).
So we have replaced the pseudoholomorphic plane ˜u in R × M by the genuinely
holomorphic plane Φ in the symplectization C of a 1-dimensional contact manifold
with the feature that both planes have the same energy and one is constant if and
only if the other is constant. The condition
,
u∗dλ = 0 says that we may discard all
but two dimensions of the symplectization.
If Φ is constant then a is constant. Then we conclude immediately from
(u∗λ) ◦i = da = 0 that Du(z) : C →Tu(z)M has image in ξu(z) = kerλ(u(z)). On
the other hand we know that πλ ◦Du(z) is the zero map, so u must be constant too.
Now we have to show that our assumptions will always yield constant Φ. Assume
ﬁrst that Φ is nonconstant and has bounded derivatives. Then Φ is an afﬁne map by
Liouville’s theorem, i.e.
Φ(z) = αz + β
with α ̸= 0. Hence Φ is biholomorphic and we obtain

Φ∗τ =

τ =

but this integral is +∞for nonconstant φ ∈Σ which contradicts the assumption
E(˜u) < +∞.
Hence we are left with the proof that Φ cannot have unbounded derivatives either.
Arguing indirectly, we pick sequences 0 < (εk)k∈N ⊂R and (zk)k∈N ⊂C such that
Rk :=

(2.21)

2.2

and
Rkεk −→+∞
εk −→0.
(2.22)
We will now use a so-called ‘bubbling-off’ argument in order to show that explo-
sion of the gradient of Φ contradicts the assumption that the energy is ﬁnite. This
argument works for all maps satisfying an elliptic partial differential equation in-
variant under conformal transformations of the domain, like the (non)linear Cauchy
Riemann equation, the Yang–Mills equation or the harmonic map equation. The
phenomenon of ‘bubbling’ was ﬁrst discovered by Sacks and Uhlenbeck for har-
monic maps [61]. Bubbling is intimately connected with the compactness of the
spaces of solutions of the above differential equations.
However, we are considering a very simple case at the moment because our
map Φ is holomorphic.
We need the following lemma by Hofer [32]:
Lemma 2.39 (Hofer’s lemma)
Let (X,d) be a complete metric space. Then for
every continuous map f : X →[0,+∞) the following holds: Given ε0 > 0, x0 ∈X
there exist ε ∈(0,ε0], x ∈X with
(a) εf (x) ≥ε0f (x0),
(b) d(x,x0) ≤2ε0,
(c) f (y) ≤2f (x) for all y with d(y,x) ≤ε.
Remark 2.40 The converse of the lemma is also true, i.e. it provides a characteriza-
tion of complete metric spaces.
Proof Deﬁne ε := ε0 and x := x0 if condition (c) holds for ε = ε0. Otherwise put
ε1 := ε0
2 and pick x1 with d(x1,x0) ≤ε0 and f (x1) > 2f (x0). Set ε := ε1, x := x1
if (c) holds for ε = ε1. Otherwise deﬁne ε2 := ε1
2 and pick x2 with d(x2,x1) ≤ε1
and f (x2) > 2f (x1). If this procedure stops after ﬁnitely many iterations then we
are done, otherwise we will get inﬁnite sequences (xk)k∈N and (εk)k∈N. In this case,
we estimate for l ≥1
d(xk+l,xk) ≤

j=k
d(xj+1,xj) ≤
∞

j=k
εj =

j=k
ε0
2j =

2k−1 .
Hence (xk)k∈N is a Cauchy sequence and has a limit by completeness of X. Let
x∞:= limk→∞xk. Since f (x1) > 0 we deduce
f (xk+1) > 2kf (x1)
implying that limk→∞f (xk) = +∞. On the other hand limk→∞f (xk) = f (x∞) ∈
R+ by continuity. This contradiction shows that the iteration above stops at some k0

such that
f (y) ≤2f (xk0)
for all y with d(y,xk0) ≤εk0.
By construction
εk0f (xk0) = ε0

Put x := xk0, ε := εk0 and the proof of the lemma is ﬁnished.

Returning to the proof of Proposition 2.36, we recall that
Rk :=
∇Φ(zk)
 −→+∞
Rkεk −→+∞
(2.23)
0 < εk −→0.
By applying the lemma to the continuous function f (z) := |∇Φ(z)|, we may choose
new sequences (ε′
k)k∈N and (z′
k)k∈N so that (2.23) still holds and in addition there
is an estimate of |∇Φ| on the ε′
k-neighborhood of z′
k. Therefore, we may assume
without loss of generality that
∇Φ(z)
 ≤2
∇Φ(zk)

if |z −zk| ≤εk.
(2.24)
Deﬁne now maps Φk : C →C by conformal rescaling
Φk(z) = Φ


−Φ(zk).
Then the maps Φk are entire holomorphic maps with
∇Φk(0)
 = 1,
Φk(0) = 0
(2.25)
and
∇Φk(z)
 ≤2
on BεkRk(0).
(2.26)
We see that for every compact subset K ⊂C containing the origin, the sequence
(Φk)k∈N is uniformly bounded in C∞(K): Use the gradient bound and Φk(0) = 0 to
obtain uniform C0-bounds and Cauchy’s integral formula for the higher derivatives.
After passing to a subsequence we may assume by the Arzela–Ascoli theorem that
the sequence (Φk)k∈N converges with all derivatives on compact sets, i.e. Φk →Ψ
in C∞
loc(C,C) where Ψ : C →C is holomorphic and satisﬁes
∇Ψ (0)
 = 1,
∇Ψ (z)
 ≤2
on every ball BR(0).

2.2

Hence Ψ is an afﬁne nonconstant map. Now we take a nonconstant function φ ∈Σ
and deﬁne φk(s) := φ(s −Re(Φ(zk))). We calculate with τφ := d(φ(s)dt) using
Φ∗τφk = ˜u∗d(φkλ):

and therefore
E(˜u) ≥

C
Ψ ∗τφ.
Since Ψ is afﬁne and nonconstant we see that the right hand side equals +∞be-
cause φ is not constant. This is a contradiction, hence we have ﬁnished the proof of
Proposition 2.36.

Let φ : R × S1 →C \ {0} be the biholomorphic map deﬁned by
φ(s,t) = e2π(s+it)
where S1 = R/Z. Let ˜u = (a,u) be a ﬁnite-energy plane with nontrivial energy (as
in Theorem 2.21). It will be more convenient to consider a ˜J -holomorphic cylinder
instead of a plane, so we deﬁne
˜v : R × S1 →R × M

˜v = ˜u ◦φ.

Remark 2.42 We remark that (2.36) and 0 < E( ˜w) < ∞is no contradiction to
Proposition 2.36. The proposition does not apply. Using a biholomorphic trans-
formation φ−1 between the cylinder and the punctured complex plane we see that
˜w ◦φ−1 cannot be continued over {0}. On the other hand, viewing ˜w as a map on
C which is periodic in the t-variable, we would get
,
C ˜w∗d(φλ) = +∞for noncon-
stant φ ∈Σ.
Let us view ˜w = (β,w): C →R × M as being 1-periodic in the second argu-
ment. We infer from (2.36) that πλ ◦T w(z) : C →ξw(z) map for all z ∈C. As in the
proof of Proposition 2.36 we construct a smooth map f : C →R so that
Φ := β + if
is holomorphic. Note that the holomorphic map Φ = β + if is nonconstant and has
bounded gradient.
Indeed, if Φ were to be constant then we would have
0 = dβ =

w∗λ

i.e. the components of ws and wt along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld would vanish. But we
also have πλws = πλwt = 0 so w would be constant contradicting

{s0}×S1 w∗λ = T > 0.

The gradient of Φ is bounded because of
sup
C
|∇Φ|2 = 2sup
C
|∇β|2 ≤2sup
C
|∇˜w|2 < +∞.
Hence by Liouville’s theorem the function Φ must be an afﬁne nonconstant func-
tion, i.e.
Φ(z) = az + b
= β(z) + if (z)
where a,b ∈C, a = a1 + ia2 ̸= 0. So
β(z) = β(s,t) = a1s −a2t + b1 = a1s + b1
since β is 1-periodic in t. Now
ws = πλws + λ(ws)Xλ(w)
= λ(ws)Xλ(w)
= −βtXλ(w)
= 0
and
wt = πλwt + λ(wt)Xλ(w)
= λ(wt)Xλ(w)
= βsXλ(w)
= a1 · Xλ(w).
Hence x(t) := w(s,a−1

ing on s). We compute

Remark 2.43 Note that we have also proved that

= +∞.
Note that Theorem 2.21 does not guarantee that the limit limR→∞u(Re2πi t

exists. It does, however, under additional assumptions, for example if the contact
form λ is nondegenerate.
Deﬁnition 2.44 Let M be a manifold with contact form λ. Let Xλ be the Reeb-
vector ﬁeld, and denote the ﬂow by φt. A T -periodic orbit x of the Reeb-vector
ﬁeld is called nondegenerate if the linear map DφT (x(0)) : kerλx(0) →kerλx(0)
does not have 1 in its spectrum.7
Nondegeneracy of all periodic orbits implies that for every T -periodic orbit x,
there is an S1-invariant open neighborhood U of xT : t →x(tT ) ∈C∞(S1,M)
which does not contain any other periodic orbit, i.e. if y is another T ′-periodic orbit
with xT (S1) ̸= yT ′(S1) then yT ′ /∈U hence the set of periodic orbits is discrete. This
is a corollary of the following simple fact:
Proposition 2.45 Assume that γ is a nondegenerate periodic orbit of Xλ with pe-
riod bounded by T > 0. Then there exists an open tubular neighborhood U = UT
of γ (S1) with the following property: If δ is a periodic orbit with minimal period T ′
and δ(S1) ⊂U then T ′ > T .
Proof Assume the statement is false. Then there are tubular neighborhoods Uk of
γ of diameter εk ↘0 and Tk-periodic orbits δk with δk(S1) ⊂Uk and supk Tk ≤T .
We reparameterize γ and δk so that they become 1-periodic and satisfy

with T0,supk Tk ≤T . After passing to a subsequence we may assume that the se-

0. Changing coordinates, we assume that Uk =
S1 × Bεk(0) with Bεk(0) = {x ∈R2n ||x| < εk}, the Reeb-vector ﬁeld is transverse
to {θ} × Bεk(0), kerλ(θ,0,0) = {θ} × R2n and γ (0),δ(0) ∈{1} × Bεk(0). Let

be the Poincaré return map (identifying {1} × Bεk(0) with Bεk(0)) so that ψ(0) = 0
and ψ(zk) = zk for suitable zk ∈Bεk(0). Again, after passing to some subsequence
we may assume that the sequence zk/|zk| has a limit z. The following expression
converges to zero as k →∞:

that γ is a nondegenerate periodic orbit: Let

be the return time map for the transverse section {1} × Bεk(0) so that ψ(z) =

|τ(zk) −τ(0)|

and identifying again {1} × Bεk(0) with Bεk(0) we calculate
Dφ1(0)z = Dψ(0)z −dτ(0)z · Xλ(0) = Dψ(0)z = z
so that γ is degenerate.
□
As the following proposition from [37] shows, it does not take much to make all
periodic orbits nondegenerate.
Proposition 2.46 Fix a contact form λ on a closed manifold M and consider the
set
Θ :=

f ∈C∞
M,(0,∞)

|f λ has only nondegenerate periodic orbits

.
Then Θ is dense in C∞(M,(0,∞)).
We will prove a more comprehensive result in the next section.
The following proposition from [35] shows that there is a genuine asymptotic
limit for a ﬁnite-energy plane in the nondegenerate case:
Proposition 2.47
Let ˜u be a ﬁnite-energy plane, and assume that Rk →∞is a
sequence such that u(Rke2πit) →x(T t) in C∞(S1,M). Assume also that x is a
nondegenerate T -periodic orbit of Xλ. Let U be any S1-invariant open neighbor-
hood of xT in C∞(S1,M). Then there is R0 > 0 such that t →u(Re2πit) ∈U for
all R ≥R0.

2.2
Asymptotic Behavior Near a Puncture
147
Proof We may assume that M in embedded into some RN. We consider the usual
Fréchet metric on the space C∞(S1,RN), which is invariant under the S1 action on
the domain, and we restrict it to C∞(S1,M). Let
T :=

xT ∈C∞
S1,M

|x solves ˙x = Xλ(x)
and is T -periodic for some T > 0

.
Let x be the nondegenerate orbit as in the proposition. Then there are disjoint S1-
invariant open subsets U1 ⊂U and U2 of C∞(S1,M) such that T ⊂U1 ∪U2 and
U1 ∩T = {xT (θ + ∗)|θ ∈S1}, i.e. the two sets isolate x from the other periodic
orbits. After conformally changing the domain, we may assume that ˜u is deﬁned on
the inﬁnite cylinder R × S1. By assumption there is a sequence sk →+∞such that
u(sk,∗) →xT in C∞(S1,M), hence u(sk,∗) ∈U1 if k is sufﬁciently large. If the
assertion of the proposition was false then we could ﬁnd another sequence σk →
+∞such that u(σk,∗) ∈U2 for large k. After passing to suitable subsequences
we may assume that sk < σk < sk+1. Because s →u(s,∗) is a continuous path
in C∞(S1,M) we can ﬁnd a sequence s′
k ∈(sk,σk) such that u(s′
k,∗) /∈U1 ∪U2.
Applying Theorem 2.21 to this sequence we can extract a subsequence such that
u(s′
k,∗) converges to yS ∈C∞(S1,M) for some S-periodic orbit y which would
imply that u(s′
k,∗) ∈U2, a contradiction.
□
2.2.5 Behavior Near a Boundary Puncture
There are versions of Theorem 2.21 for pseudoholomorphic curves ˜u deﬁned on a
Riemann surface S with boundary and punctures on the boundary which play an
important role in certain versions of SFT. The most common boundary conditions
for pseudoholomorphic curves in the cylindrical setting R × M are:
(1)
˜u(∂S) ⊂R × L,
where L is a Legendrian submanifold of M. If M has dimension 2n + 1 then
L has dimension n, and λ|T L ≡0, i.e. the tangent spaces to L are contained in
the contact hyperplanes. Show as an exercise that this is the maximal possible
dimension for a submanifold to satisfy this condition. Also show that
R × L ⊂

R × M,ω = d

etλ

is Lagrangian.
(2)
dim(M) = 3
and
˜u(∂S) ⊂{0} × D∗,
where D ⊂M is a surface, Γ = {p ∈D |TpD = kerλ(p)} and D∗:= D\Γ .
The points in Γ are called the singular points of the surface (generically this is
a ﬁnite set). Show as an exercise that this boundary condition is totally real, i.e.
T

{0} × D∗
∩˜J

T

{0} × D∗
= {0}.

148

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Theorem 2.54 below from [1] describes the behavior near a boundary puncture
where S is a disk with one boundary puncture and where the boundary condition is
as in (1) above. Again, this can be generalized to arbitrary punctured surfaces, and
we will do so after having discussed the Monotonicity lemma. If H + := {s +it ∈C |
t ≥0} is the closed upper half of the complex plane, (M,λ) a contact manifold and
L ⊂M a Legendrian submanifold then we deﬁne a ﬁnite-energy half-plane to be a
map
˜u = (a,u) : H + −→R × M
that satisﬁes the following conditions:
(1) ∂s ˜u + ˜J(˜u)∂t ˜u = 0 on
◦
H +
(2) ˜u(∂H +) ⊂R × L
(3) ˜u has ﬁnite energy:
E(˜u) := sup
φ∈Σ

H + ˜u∗d(φλ) < +∞.
(where Σ := {φ ∈C∞(R,[0,1])|φ′ ≥0})
(4) u(H +) is contained in a compact subset of M.
Deﬁnition 2.48 Let L ⊂M be a Legendrian submanifold. A characteristic chord
for (λ,L) is a trajectory x of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld such that x(0),x(T ) ∈L for
some T > 0. Let φt be the ﬂow of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld. We say a characteristic
chord x is nondegenerate if
kerλx(T ) = Tx(T )L ⊕DφT

x(0)

Tx(0)L.
Remark 2.49 It is possible that a characteristic chord agrees with or lies on a peri-
odic orbit. We note that for such orbits the notions of nondegeneracy are different
depending on whether we regard it as a characteristic chord or as a periodic orbit.
It is reasonable to assume that such ‘hybrid’ orbits do not exist since they do not
generically. Characteristic chords can be made nondegenerate by perturbing L or by
perturbing the contact form.
Deﬁnition 2.50 The pair (λ,L) is called nondegenerate if all periodic orbits and
characteristic chords are nondegenerate.
The following result shows that a contact form can be slightly modiﬁed to render
all periodic orbits and characteristic chords nondegenerate. In [17] the authors prove
a similar results for periodic orbits only. We adapt their proof to address also charac-
teristic chords, and we carry out some arguments in detail which are only sketched
in the original paper.

a Legendrian submanifold. Consider the set
Θ :=

f ∈C∞
M,(0,∞)

|(f λ,L) is nondegenerate

.
Then Θ is dense in C∞(M,(0,∞)).
The proof requires some preparation.
Let λ0 be some contact form. Assume that x is a periodic orbit of Xλ0 with
minimal period τ or a characteristic chord of length τ. Consider a sufﬁciently small
Darboux neighborhood diffeomorphic to [−c,c] × R2n of a point on x. We wish to
modify the Poincaré map of x by changing the Reeb-vector ﬁeld from Xλ0 to Xλ
where λ = f λ0 with a positive function f . We will discuss these issues only for the
case n = 1 in order to keep notation manageable. The results also hold in higher
dimensions.
First consider smooth functions ψ : [−c,c] →R+ and ϕ : D →R+ with

The Reeb-vector ﬁeld of f λ0 = f (dt + x dy) is given by
Xλ = 1
f 2 (f + xfx,fy −xft,−fx).
Lemma 2.52 Let 0 < r < 1/

8. Then there is 0 < d = d(r) such that the following
maps:
La,b : {−c} × Br(0) −→{c} × B2r(0)
are well-deﬁned whenever a2 + b2 ≤d2: If ζ(s) = (t(s),x(s),y(s)) is a trajec-
tory of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ = Xfa,bλ0 with t(0) = −c and x2(0) + y2(0) ≤r2
then La,b(−c,(x(0),y(0))) is the ﬁrst intersection point of the trajectory ζ(s) with
{c} × B2r(0).
Moreover, La,b depends smoothly on the parameters a,b and the partial deriva-
tives ∂La,b
∂a , ∂La,b
∂b
evaluated at the point a = b = 0 are linear independent.
Proof We need to show ﬁrst that the maps La,b are well-deﬁned provided d is cho-
sen appropriately. The trajectories of the vector ﬁelds Xλ and Y = f 2Xλ are the
same up to parameterization. We will therefore use trajectories (t(s),x(s),y(s)) =
(t(s),ξ(s)) of Y for the construction of La,b. If s is sufﬁciently close to zero then we

t′(s) > 0 for 0 ≤s ≤s0, and the trajectory will hit {c} × B2r(0) before time s0. In
particular, the maps La,b are well-deﬁned, and they are diffeomorphisms onto their
images.
In order to study the behavior of the maps La,b as functions of a,b we consider

Given a Darboux chart [−c,c]×R2 as in the previous lemma, and assuming that
[−c,c] × {(0,0)} lies on a periodic orbit x of Xλ0, we may consider the Poincaré
return map of the perturbed Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ
Pa,b : {c} × Br(0) −→{c} × B2r(0),
Pa,b = La,b ◦ψ
where ψ : {c} × Bρ(0) →{−c} × Br(0) (for suitable ρ > 0) is given as follows:
ψ(c,v) is the ﬁrst intersection point of the trajectory ζ, ζ(0) = (c,v) of the un-
perturbed Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ0 with {−c} × Br(0). Note that this is well-deﬁned
since ψ(c,0) = (−c,0). If [−c,c]×{(0,0)} lies on a characteristic chord x we may
similarly express the Poincaré map of the perturbed Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ using the
map La,b. The following lemma is a trivial consequence of Lemma 2.52.
Lemma 2.53 For any z ∈Br(0) the partial derivatives ∂Pa,b
∂a
and ∂Pa,b
∂b
at a = b = 0
are linear independent.
We can now prove Theorem 2.51.
Proof Let N > 0 and consider the set
FN =

Let Γ ′
N be the set of all periodic orbits of Xλ of action no greater than N, and let
Γ ′′
N be the set of all characteristic chords of length no greater than N. We reparam-
eterize x ∈Γ ′
N ∪Γ ′′
N so that it is deﬁned on the interval [0,1] and ˙x = αXλ(x) with
0 < α ≤N. By the Ascoli–Arzela theorem the sets Γ ′
N,Γ ′′
N ⊂C∞(M,(0,∞)) are
compact. Then the set

and
V ′
i ≈(−1,2) × B2(0),
Vi ≈(−1,2) × B1(0),

j ̸= ∅.
(2) The Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ is transverse to the foliation by the vertical disks {θ}×
B2(0). The set L ∩Vi has ﬁnitely many connected components Lk with the
property that each of them is contained in {ik} × R2n for some ﬁnite sequence
0 = i0 < ··· < iK = 1.
(3) For any θ ∈S1 = R/Z (or θ ∈[0,1]) all trajectories starting from {θ} × B1(0)
stay inside S1 × B2(0) (or [0,1] × B2(0)) at least for an amount of time greater
than N + 1.
We note that these properties are still valid for trajectories of the perturbed vector
ﬁeld Xf λ provided f is sufﬁciently close to 1.
In the case of the sets Ui, consider the Poincaré return maps ψf : {θ} × B1(0) →
{θ} × B2(0) for the ﬂow of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xf λ, and let D ⊂({θ} × B1(0)) ×
({θ} × B2(0)) be the diagonal.
In the case of the sets Vi we denote by ψf : {0} × B1(0) →{1} × B2(0) the map
which associates to (0,v) ∈{0} × B1(0) the point ζ(t) ∈{1} × B2(0) where ζ is
the trajectory of Xf λ with ζ(0) = (0,v) and t is the earliest time when ζ intersects
{1} × B2(0). The diagonal D is replaced with the set
D = L0 × L1,
Lk = L ∩

{k} × Bk+1(0)

,
k = 0,1
where L is the Legendrian. We will also refer to ψf and D as the ‘Poincaré map’
and the ‘diagonal’. We will simplify notation and view the Poincaré map as a map
from B1(0) into B2(0) and D ⊂B1(0) × B2(0).
The intersection graph(ψf ) ∩D then consists either of pairs (x,x) ∈B1(0) ×
B1(0) such that (θ,x) lies on a periodic orbit or of pairs (x,y) ∈B1(0)×B2(0) such
that (0,x),(1,y) ∈L lie on the same Reeb trajectory which is then a characteristic
chord.
We will demonstrate that transversality of the intersection is equivalent to nonde-
generacy of all corresponding periodic orbits and characteristic chords, respectively.
Assume that p = (x,y) ∈graph(ψf ) ∩D. We discuss the case of a periodic orbit
ﬁrst so that x = y = ψf (x). The intersection is transverse if and only if for any
(η1,η2) ∈R2n ⊕R2n there are ξ,ζ ∈R2n such that
(η1,η2) = (ξ,ξ) +

This is always solvable if and only if 1 is not an eigenvalue of Dψf (x), i.e. the
corresponding periodic orbit is nondegenerate.
Consider now the case of a characteristic chord. Then p = (x,y) satisﬁes y =
ψf (x) and x,y ∈L. The characteristic chord between x and y is nondegenerate if
and only if
R2n = TyL ⊕Dψf (x)TxL.
Since L is n-dimensional this is equivalent to TyL ∩Dψf (x)TxL = {0}. Similarly,
transversality of the intersection of graph(ψf ) and D at p is equivalent to
Tp

.
If (v,w) ∈Tp(graph(ψf )) ∩TpD then v ∈TxL,w ∈TyL and w = Dψf (x)v. This
shows that transversality of the intersection is equivalent to nondegeneracy of the
characteristic chord.
After having derived a geometric characterization of nondegeneracy we can now
prove that the set FN is open and dense. We ﬁrst show that the set FN is open. We
assume that 1 ∈FN, and we want to show that f ∈FN provided f −1 is sufﬁciently
small.
In addition to properties (1)–(3) on page 154 above we may assume that the sets
Ui, Vi also satisfy the following:
S1 × {0} ⊂Ui is a nondegenerate periodic orbit of Xλ, and [0,1] × {0} ⊂Vi is
a nondegenerate characteristic chord of Xλ of action/length no greater than N.
Moreover, it is the only periodic orbit/characteristic chord of action ≤N inside
Ui or Vi respectively.
Because there is only one periodic orbit in each set Ui and one characteristic chord
in each set Vi (of length/action at most N) we have graph(ψ1) ∩D = {(0,0)},
and the intersection is transverse. Assume that fk →1 uniformly with all deriva-
tives so that there is a non-transverse intersection point pk ∈graph(ψfk) ∩D. Be-
cause D is closed8 a subsequence of {pk} must converge to the intersection point
graph(ψ1) ∩D = {(0,0)} which is impossible since small perturbations of f = 1
only yield transverse intersections nearby. Hence any sufﬁciently small perturba-
tion f of 1 has the property that Ui and Vi still contain a single nondegenerate
periodic orbit or nondegenerate chord, respectively. It remains to show that a suf-
ﬁciently small perturbation of f cannot create any other periodic orbits of action
≤N or any other characteristic chords of length ≤N.
Any periodic orbit or characteristic chord starting in {θ} × B1(0) must remain
inside S1 × B2(0) or [0,1] × B2(0), respectively, for a time no less than N + 1
and therefore it must have action/length greater than N. If the perturbation were to
8Here is a toy example to demonstrate why closedness of D is important. Consider in R2 the sets
D = (0,1)×{0} and graph(fc) with fc(x) = (x −c)2 and c ∈[0,1). Then graph(f0) ⋔D because
the intersection is empty, but for nonzero c, however small, the intersection graph(fc) ∩D is not
transverse. For closed D such a scenario is not possible.

produce any new periodic orbit or characteristic chord of action ≤N then it cannot
intersect any of the open sets Ui or Vi, respectively. We claim now that there is ε > 0
such that ∥f −1∥Cl < ε for all l ≥0 implies that Xf λ has no periodic orbits of
action ≤N in Z′ = M\
i Ui and no characteristic chords of length ≤N in Z′′ =
M\
i Vi either. Otherwise, in the ﬁrst case, we could ﬁnd sequences fk →1 as
k →+∞uniformly with all derivatives and δk : [0,1] →Z′ with ˙δk = αkXfkλ(δk),
supk αk ≤N, δk(0) = δk(1). The Ascoli–Arzela theorem implies that a subsequence
of this sequence converges to a periodic orbit of the vector ﬁeld Xλ of action no
more than N which is completely contained in Z′. This contradicts the fact that all
such orbits are contained in the sets Ui. The same argument can be used to deal with
the case of a characteristic chord. This concludes the proof of the assertion that the
set FN is open.
We now want to show that the set FN ⊂C∞(M,(0,∞)) is dense. It sufﬁces to
show that for any ε > 0 there exists a smooth positive function f with ∥f ∥Ck < ε
for all k ≥0 such that 1+f ∈FN. Let {Ui}1≤i≤iN be open sets covering the periodic
trajectories of Xλ of action no more than N, and let {Ui}iN+1≤i≤I , I = IN, be open
sets covering the characteristic chords of (L,Xλ) of length no more than N. Recall
that only ﬁnitely many such sets are necessary because the sets Γ ′
N,Γ ′′
N in (2.39)
are compact. We assume that {Ui}, Ui ⊂U′
i satisfy the same conditions (1)–(3) as
before on page 154 with the exception that we assume Ui ≈S1 × Br(0) for i ≤iN
and Ui ≈(−1,2) × Br(0) for i ≥iN + 1 where r is the constant from Lemma 2.52.
Recall that for each of these sets we have Poincaré return maps for Reeb-vector
ﬁelds X(1+fi)λ
ψfi : {θ} × Br(0) →{θ} × B2r(0)
or
{0} × Br(0) →{1} × B2r(0).
if fi : U′
i →(0,+∞) are sufﬁciently small. Also, if f : M →(0,+∞) is sufﬁ-
ciently small then

• if y is a characteristic chord of length ℓ≤N for the Reeb-vector ﬁeld X(1+f )λ
then y([0,ℓ]) ⊂I

Both assertions are proved indirectly by taking a sequence fn →0 and using the
deﬁnitions of the sets Ui, the Ascoli–Arzela theorem and property (3) for the second
assertion.

choosing the supports of the functions ψi small enough we can arrange that

and the map Ψ = (Ψ1,...,ΨI) between the I-fold products. Hence Ψ is transverse
to the product of the diagonals D ⊂Br(0) × B2r(0). By parametric transversality
(see [31], Chap. 3, Theorem 2.7) the set

A = (A1,...,AI) ∈R2n × ··· × R2n | graph(ψfAi,i) ⋔D ∀1 ≤i ≤I

is residual and in particular dense.9 The above set is also open since small perturba-
tions of A preserve transversality of intersections and D is closed. In order to make
all periodic orbits of action ≤N entering Ui, 1 ≤i ≤iN, nondegenerate we need
to consider a ﬁnite number of iterates ψfAi,i,ψ2
fAi,i,...,ψmi
fAi,i of the Poincaré map
since we need to consider iterates of all periodic orbits in Ui as long as their actions
are bounded by N. The argument for characteristic chords is similar to the above.
Note that a characteristic chord x : [0,ℓ] →M, ℓ≤N, may hit the Legendrian sub-
manifold L multiple times 0 = t0 < t1 < ··· < tm = T . Then each segment x|[ti,tj ]
with i < j is a characteristic chord of length bounded by N. For iN + 1 ≤i ≤I
let Lk be the connected components of L ∩Ui so that Lk ⊂{ik} × Br(0) with
0 = i0 < ··· < iK = 1. For each pair 0 ≤i < j ≤K we can set up a small Darboux
neighborhood on which we perturb the Reeb-vector ﬁeld such that all characteristic
chords from Li to Lj become nondegenerate. We proceed as before, and since we
always take ﬁnite intersections, we obtain the result that the set ΣN of all param-
eters A for which all periodic orbits of action ≤N entering U1 ∪··· ∪UiN , and
the set of all characteristic chords entering UiN+1 ∪··· ∪UIN of length ≤N are all
9Recall that a set is called residual if it is a countable intersection of open and dense sets. By
Baire’s lemma such a set is dense.

nondegenerate. Note that it does not matter for the argument whether a character-
istic chord lies on or coincides with a periodic orbit. If |A| < εN for some εN > 0
which is chosen sufﬁciently small then there are no periodic orbits or characteris-
tic chords of action/length ≤N outside UN = U1 ∪··· ∪UIN so that all periodic
orbits of X(1+fA)λ of action ≤N and all characteristic chords of length ≤N are
nondegenerate.
Summarizing, we now know that the sets FN ∈C∞(M,(0,∞)) are open and
dense. Then the intersection -
N∈N FN is dense which completes the proof of The-
orem 2.51.

The following result is a version of Theorem 2.21 for curves with boundary.
Theorem 2.54 Let ˜u be a ﬁnite-energy half-plane which is in addition not constant.
Then T :=
,
H + u∗dλ > 0 and any sequence of positive real numbers tending to +∞
has a subsequence Rk →+∞, so that the maps
[0,T ] −→M
t −→u(Rkeπi t
T )
converge in C∞to some orbit x of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ with x(0),x(T ) ∈L.
The proof, which we reproduce from [1], requires some preparation (see also [63]
for a slightly different approach). The following proposition states that ﬁnite-energy
half-planes with ‘trivial dλ-energy’ must be constant. It is the analogue of Proposi-
tion 2.36. The boundary condition will play an important role in the proof.
Proposition 2.55 Let ˜u be a ﬁnite-energy half-plane with

Case (1) If Φ+ is constant then a is constant, too. Since
λ(u)∂su = −∂ta = 0
and
λ(u)∂tu = ∂sa = 0
the map T u(z) has image in the kernel of λ(u(z)), but we saw before that πλ ◦T u(z)
is the zero map, so T u(z) is always zero and u is constant.
We will show now that the other two cases cannot occur.
Case (2) If |∇Φ+| is bounded, then |∇Φ| is also bounded. By Liouville’s the-
orem the functions ∂sΦ, ∂tΦ : C →C must be constant, i.e. Φ must be an afﬁne

We have to consider the following cases, where zk = sk + itk:
• tkRk →+∞(without loss of generality assume tkRk ↗+∞)
• tkRk →l ∈[0,+∞).

Let us begin with the ﬁrst case:
Deﬁne the holomorphic maps

which are deﬁned on

Hence

for z ∈BεkRk(0)
Φk(0) = 0.
Let K be a compact subset of the complex plane. Choose k0 so large that for all
k ≥k0 K ⊂Ωk and K ⊂BεkRk(0). Then (Φk)k≥k0 is a sequence of nonconstant
holomorphic functions on K which is uniformly bounded in C1. Using the Cauchy
integral formula we obtain uniform C∞-bounds on K. By the theorem of Ascoli–
Arzela there exists a subsequence (Φk′) ⊂(Φk) which converges in C∞(K). Iterat-
ing this process by taking larger K and extracting further subsequences from (Φk′)
we get ﬁnally by choosing a diagonal sequence some subsequence of (Φk) which
converges in C∞
loc to a holomorphic map
Ψ : C −→C
satisfying |∇Ψ (0)| = 1 and |∇Ψ (z)| ≤2. By Liouville’s theorem Ψ must be an
afﬁne (nonconstant) function. Deﬁning φk(s) := φ(s −Re(Φ+(zk))) ∈Σ we have

This contradiction shows that the ﬁrst case cannot occur. So let us consider the
second case:
Here we deﬁne the following holomorphic maps, where z = s + it and zk =

They are deﬁned on the upper half-plane H + and map the boundary ∂H + into the

some number k0 so that for all k ≥k0 we have K ⊂BεkRk(0,Rktk). Since Φ(0) = 0
we obtain a uniform C1 bound for the sequence (Φk)k≥k0. Reasoning as before we
obtain C∞
loc convergence of some subsequence of (Φk) to a nonconstant holomorphic
map
Ψ : H + −→C
which satisﬁes |∇Ψ (z)| ≤2 and Ψ (∂H +) ⊂R. Using the Schwarz reﬂection prin-
ciple we can extend Ψ to an entire holomorphic function which must be afﬁne by
Liouville’s theorem. H := Ψ (H +) is then again a half-plane in C and we compute

□
The next proposition is the counterpart of Proposition 2.41. We transform a ﬁnite-
energy half-plane ˜u to the inﬁnite strip R × [0,1] by considering ˜v := ˜u ◦φ instead
of ˜u where φ is the following biholomorphic map:
φ : R × [0,1] −→H +\{0}
φ(s,t) := eπ(s+it).
(2.40)
We will call ˜v a ﬁnite-energy strip since E(˜v) = E(˜u) < ∞.
Proposition 2.56 Let ˜v = (b,v) : R × [0,1] →R × M be a solution of the follow-
ing boundary value problem:
∂s ˜v + ˜J(˜v)∂t ˜v = 0
v(R × {0,1}) ⊂L.
Assume, moreover, that v(R × [0,1]) is contained in a compact region K ⊂M and
E(˜v) < +∞.

Then
sup

Then we must have sk →+∞. Otherwise if we had sk ≤c for a subsequence then
the sequence φ(z′
k) would be contained in some half ball B+
R (0) but supB+
R (0) |∇˜u| ≤
const and |∇˜v(z)| = πeπs|∇˜u(φ(z))|. This is a contradiction since this expression
would be bounded.
We may assume without loss of generality that the sequence (t′
k) converges to
some t0 ∈[0,1]. Choose now a sequence (ε′
k) of positive real numbers converging to
zero so that still R′
kε′
k →+∞. Hofer’s lemma gives us now new sequences εk ↘0

We have

(2) |∇˜v(z)| ≤2 ∀z ∈BεkRk(0) ∩Ωk
(3) bk(0) = 0
(4) vk(∂Ωk) ⊂L
Because of (2), (3) and the assumption v(R × [0,1]) ⊂K we have a C0
loc-bound on
all the maps ˜vk uniform in k. Using the regularity estimates as in Proposition 2.32
and Remark 2.35 we will get uniform C∞
loc-bounds which implies by the Ascoli–
Arzela theorem that a subsequence of ˜vk converges in C∞
loc to some limit
˜w = (β,w) : Ω −→R × M
where Ω ⊂C depends on the following cases:

2.2

(1) −tkRk →l ∈(−∞,0] (then necessarily Rk(1 −tk) →+∞).
Here we have Ω = H−l := {z ∈C| Im(z) ≥−l} and w(∂H−l) ⊂L.
(2) −tkRk →−∞
(a) Rk(1 −tk) →m ∈[0,+∞).
In this case we have Ω = H m := {z ∈C| Im(z) ≤m} and w(∂H m) ⊂L.
(b) Rk(1 −tk) →+∞.
Here we get Ω = C.
In all these cases we have

Then

K

Since this holds for all compact subsets K of Ω we obtain

and ﬁnally taking the supremum over all φ ∈Σ:

v∗dλ =

R×[0,1]
˜v∗d(φ0λ) ≤E(˜v) < +∞
where φ0 ≡1 ∈Σ. This implies ﬁnally

Ω
w∗dλ = 0
because the integral vanishes over any compact subset of Ω. If Ω is a half-plane
in C then Proposition 2.55 would imply that ˜w must be constant which contradicts
the fact that the gradient in 0 does not vanish. Hence our assumption at the very
beginning that the gradient is unbounded must be false.
We also arrive at a contradiction in the case Ω = C by Proposition 2.36 which
completes the proof of the proposition.
□
Now we are ready to prove Theorem 2.54:
Proof We assume that we have transformed our ﬁnite-energy plane to a ﬁnite-
energy strip ˜v = (b,v). So take any sequence sk →+∞and deﬁne

As in the proof of Proposition 2.55 we see that πλ ◦T w(z) is the zero map and

∂tβ = −λ(w)∂sw must vanish identically on R × {0,1}. Our aim is to show that β

where x(0) = w(s,0) ∈L and x(T ) = w(s,1) ∈L, hence x is a characteristic

We are left with the proof that β is an afﬁne function depending on s only.
We put γ := ∂tβ and recall that:
• γ = 0
• C := supR×[0,1] |γ | < ∞
• γ (s,0) ≡γ (s,1) ≡0.
If we deﬁne
δ(s,t) :=
 t
0
∂sγ (s,τ)dτ −
 s
0
∂tγ (σ,0)dσ
then f := γ + iδ is a holomorphic function with bounded real part and g(s,t) :=
ef (s,t) is also holomorphic with
g(s,t)
 =
eγ (s,t) · eiδ(s,t) ≤eC
and
g(s,0)
 =
g(s,1)
 = 1.
For each ε > 0 we deﬁne the holomorphic function hε on R × [0,1] by
hε(z) :=
1
1 −iεz.
Then
hε(z)
2 =

ε2s2 + (1 + εt)2 ≤1
and therefore
g(z)hε(z)

for z ∈R × {0,1}. We also have for z /∈iR
hε(z)
 ≤

ε|s|

in view of |1 −iεz|2 ≥ε2s2. Consider now the holomorphic function ghε on Ω :=
[−eCε−1,eCε−1] × [0,1]. We have
g(z)hε(z)
 ≤1
for z ∈∂Ω and by the maximum principle this estimate holds also for z ∈Ω. Since
also |g(z)hε(z)| ≤1 outside Ω, we obtain ﬁnally
g(z)hε(z)
 ≤1
∀z ∈R × [0,1], ε > 0.
Fixing z ∈R × [0,1] and considering the limit ε →0 we conclude that |g(z)| =
eγ (s,t) ≤1, and therefore γ (s,t) ≤0. Repeating the same argument with −γ instead
of γ we obtain γ (s,t) ≥0, so γ ≡0.
Hence β does not depend on t and is harmonic which implies
β(s,t) = as + c
with real constants a and c. Because of a = T > 0 we have b(sk,t) →+∞as
k →∞similar to the case of a ﬁnite-energy plane. This completes the proof.
□
We recall the notion of nondegeneracy for characteristic chords:
If x is a characteristic chord for (λ,L) then the pair (x,L) is called nondegener-
ate if

x(T )

= T ϕT

x(0)

Tx(0)L ⊕Tx(T )L
where ϕ denotes the ﬂow of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld Xλ.
There is the following reﬁnement of Theorem 2.54 under the additional assump-
tion that x is nondegenerate (see [1] for a proof, and compare with Proposition 2.47
which is a weaker result):
Theorem 2.57 Let ˜u be a nonconstant ﬁnite-energy half-plane. If Rk →∞is a se-
quence of positive numbers so that u(Rkeπi t
T ) converges to a nondegenerate char-
acteristic chord x then we have in fact:

The following result from [2] (which we are not going to prove) deals with a
pseudoholomorphic disk with two punctures on the boundary and mixed boundary
condition. More precisely, we consider a Legendrian knot L ⊂M, dim(M) = 3 and
a Seifert surface D for L, i.e. ∂D = L and pseudoholomorphic strips as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
˜u = (a,u) : S := R × [0,1] −→R × M
∂s ˜u + ˜J(˜u)∂t ˜u = 0
˜u(s,0) ⊂R × L
˜u(s,1) ⊂{0} × D∗∗
E(˜u) < +∞
(2.41)

2.3
Isoperimetric Inequality, Monotonicity Lemma, Removal of Singularities

where D∗∗is the spanning surface D without some open neighborhood U of the set
of singular points Γ . Then the following statement is true:
Theorem 2.58
Let ˜u be a ﬁnite-energy strip as in (2.41). Then there are points
p+,p−∈L so that
˜u(s,t)
s→±∞
−→(0,p±)
in C∞([0,1]).
All these results can be signiﬁcantly improved (for Theorems 2.21 and 2.54 we
need to assume nondegeneracy). First, one can show that the convergence of u(R,∗)
to the limit for R →∞is exponentially fast with all derivatives. In addition, one
can derive an asymptotic formula for u(s,t) in suitable local coordinates provided s
is sufﬁciently large. The proofs of these results are signiﬁcantly more complicated
than the results we have proved in this section (see [2, 34, 35]).
2.3 Isoperimetric Inequality, Monotonicity Lemma, Removal
of Singularities
In this section, we will explore some of the geometric properties of pseudoholo-
morphic curves. These results appeared ﬁrst in [30], but they have counterparts
for harmonic maps [61] which were discovered earlier. After deriving a mean
value inequality for the derivative of a pseudoholomorphic curve, we will prove
the isoperimetric inequality. General references are [30] (for a really short proof),
[46, 50, 59] and [58]. After that we will prove the removal of singularities theorem,
which roughly asserts that a local pseudoholomorphic curve with ﬁnite energy and
bounded image can be smoothly extended over its punctures (similarly to ordinary
holomorphic functions). In the previous section we have shown that the singularity
of a nonconstant ﬁnite-energy plane in a symplectization R×M is never removable,
when viewed as a punctured sphere. The same is true for a nonconstant ﬁnite-energy
half-plane in R × M with boundary values in R × L when viewed as a disk with
a boundary puncture. If the domain is a general punctured Riemann surface, singu-
larities may be removable or not, as we will explore in detail later on. We will start
with the following mean value inequality from [50].
Proposition 2.59 (Mean value inequality) Assume that (W,J) is an almost com-
plex manifold, let C ⊂W be a compact subset. Suppose W is equipped with a
J -invariant Riemannian metric g. Then there is a constant ε0 = ε0(J,C,g) > 0
such that the following holds: For any pseudoholomorphic curve u : Br := {z ∈C |
|z −z0| ≤r} →W for which
,
Br |Du|2 < ε0 and u(Br) ⊂C we have

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
If u is a pseudoholomorphic curve deﬁned on Br ∩H + with boundary condition
u(Br ∩R) ⊂L, where L ⊂W is a totally real submanifold, then the same inequality
holds with Br replaced with Br ∩H +.
Proof We only need to prove the proposition for r = 1. The assertion follows for


|us|2 + |ut|2
which also equals |us|2 = |ut|2 since u is pseudoholomorphic and the metric
g = ⟨·,·⟩is J -invariant. The proposition looks now like the classical mean value
inequality for subharmonic functions. So it looks reasonable to have a closer look
at e. Unfortunately, e is not subharmonic, so we have to take it one step at a time.
Step 1: Show that e + ae2 ≥0 for some constant a = a(J,C,g) > 0.
Denote by ∇the corresponding Levi-Civita connection and by R the curvature
tensor. We introduce the following notation:
ξ := us,
η := ut
so that
ξ + J(u)η = 0
and
e = |ξ|2 = |η|2.
(2.43)
We compute
e = 2|∇sξ|2 + 2|∇tξ|2 + 2⟨ξ,∇s∇sξ + ∇t∇tξ⟩.
We would like to estimate this from below by −ae2 plus nonnegative terms involv-
ing the derivatives of ξ. We ﬁrst note that
∇sη = ∇tξ
(2.44)
since in local coordinates the two expressions correspond to ust + Γ (u)(us,ut)
and uts + Γ (u)(ut,us), respectively. These local expressions are equal because the
Levi-Civita connection is torsion-free (we will in the following denote the various
Christoffel symbols simply by Γ ). The differential equation in (2.43) and (2.44)
now lead to

We need to choose the metric g so that it has the following additional properties:

(2) L is totally geodesic with respect to g
(3) J(p)TpL ⊥TpL ∀p ∈L

176

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
(note that L becomes ‘Lagrangian’ with respect to the 2-form ω = g ◦(Id×J), but
ω is in general not symplectic because it may not be closed.) Here is a sketch how
to obtain such a metric (try it yourself and see [50], Lemma 4.3.3. for more): We
choose local coordinates x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn such that
J ∂
∂xk
= ∂
∂yk
,
1 ≤k ≤n on L.
If we write in these coordinates
g(x,y) =

a(x,y)
b(x,y)T
b(x,y)
c(x,y)

,
J(x,y) =
A(x,y)
B(x,y)
C(x,y)
D(x,y)

the requirements on the metric are equivalent to
a(x,0) = c(x,0),
b(x,0) = 0,
∂n+ka(x,0) = 0,
J T gJ = g.
Then patch the local metrics together using cut-off functions and show that the prop-
erties are preserved.
The strategy is to extend the energy density from the upper half-disk to the full
disk by e(s,t) := e(s,−t) for t < 0. We now show that the normal derivative along
the boundary of the half-disk vanishes


∇s(Jξ),ξ
 (a)
= ⟨J∇sξ,ξ⟩
(b)

where all terms are evaluated at (s,0). Equation (a) follows from the fact that ∇sJ is
skew-adjoint. Since L is totally geodesic we have ξ(s,0) ∈Tu(s,0)L ⇒∇sξ(s,0) ∈
Tu(s,0)L. Then we get zero since L is totally real.
□
Remark 2.60 (The mean value inequality in the symplectization) In the statement
of the mean value inequality we assumed that the image of the pseudoholomorphic
curve lies in some compact subset C of the symplectic manifold, and the constant ε0
depends on C. If the symplectic manifold under consideration is the symplectization
R × M of a compact contact manifold M equipped with the symplectic form ω =
d(etλ) then this assumption is not necessary: The dependency on C appears in step 1
of the proof where the Laplacian of the energy density is estimated. More concretely,
the derivatives of the almost complex structure and the Christoffel symbols of the
metric are estimated over the compact set C. In the case where W = R × M, the
almost complex structure ˜J is R-invariant, while the metric is given by
g = d

etλ

◦(Id× ˜J).
Hence, in local coordinates, the metric tensor g = (gij) is given by etg′
ij, where
g′
ij does not depend on t because the almost complex structure does not. Since the
Christoffel symbols are given by
Γ i
jk = 1

177
and gil = e−t(g′)il they actually do not depend on t. Therefore, we can arrange
e + ae2 ≥0 with a constant a > 0 only depending on J,M and λ.
We continue with some brief remarks about ω-tame and ω-compatible almost
complex structures.
Deﬁnition 2.61 Let (W,ω) be a symplectic manifold. An almost complex structure
J : T W →T W on W is called ω-tame if
ω(v,Jv) > 0
for all v ̸= 0.
It is called ω-compatible if in addition
ω(Jv,Jw) = ω(v,w)
for all v,w.
We deﬁne a corresponding Riemannian metric on W by
gJ (v,w) := ⟨v,w⟩J := 1
2

ω(v,Jw) + ω(w,Jv)

.
Exercise 2.62 (Energy identity) Let (Σ,j) be a Riemann surface with correspond-
ing volume element dμj. Let (W,ω) be a symplectic manifold with an almost com-
plex structure J .
(1) If u : Σ →W is a J -holomorphic curve and if J is ω-tame then
E(u) := 1
2

Σ
|Du|2
J dμj =

Σ
u∗ω.
(2) If u : Σ →W is any smooth map and if J is ω-compatible then
E(u) =

Σ
|¯∂J u|2
J dμj +

Σ
u∗ω,
where ¯∂J u := Du + J(u) ◦Du ◦j.
Note that without the ω-tame condition the L2-norm of the gradient E(u) will
depend on the metric on W. If Σ is a closed surface or if ∂Σ ̸= ∅but u(∂Σ) ⊂L,
with L ⊂W Lagrangian, then the energy E(u) only depends on the homology class
of u in H2(W,R) or H2(W,L,R) and is therefore a topological invariant. Also in
the case of punctured pseudoholomorphic curves asymptotic to cylinders over peri-
odic orbits of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld, the above relationship yields an energy bound in
terms of the asymptotic data. In the ω-compatible case we see that E(u) ≥
,
Σ u∗ω
with equality if and only if u is pseudoholomorphic, i.e. such a u minimizes the en-
ergy in its homology class. Exercise 2.63 below implies that it is a minimal surface.
We will use the mean value inequality to prove an isoperimetric inequality. The
most basic isoperimetric inequality is the following: Assume that γ ⊂R2 is a simple

178
2
Pseudoholomorphic Curves
closed curve bounding some region Ω. Then
area(Ω) ≤1
4π ℓ(γ )2
with equality if and only if γ is a circle. In other words, among all simple closed
curves in R2 with ﬁxed length, the circles enclose the largest area. We are inter-
ested in a symplectic version of this: Assume u : D →(W,ω) is a J -holomorphic
disk, where J is ω-tame (and W is equipped with the standard Riemannian metric
g = gJ ). The area of u(D) is given by
A(u) :=

D
σu,
where σu is the following 2-form on D:
σu(η,ζ) :=

g(Du · ζ,Du · ζ)g(Du · η,Du · η) −g2(Du · ζ,Du · η).
Exercise 2.63 Because u is J -holomorphic and J is ω-tame
A(u) =

D
u∗ω =

D
Du(s,t)
2 ds ∧dt = E(u).
Usually, isoperimetric inequalities deal with the area, but we will rather work
with
,
u∗ω by the above exercise. We follow the presentation of [50]. Consider a
smooth loop γ : S1 = R/2πZ →W in a symplectic manifold (W,ω) such that its
length
ℓ(γ ) =
 2π
0
 ˙γ (t)

J dt
is smaller than the injectivity radius of W. We assume that J is ω-tame and that W
is equipped with the usual metric. Then γ (S1) is contained in some geodesic ball B
whose diameter is no more than the injectivity radius. The 2-form ω|B is exact, i.e.
ω|B = dλ for some 1-form λ. We then deﬁne the local symplectic action of γ by
a(γ ) :=

S1 γ ∗λ.
An alternative deﬁnition is the following: Deﬁne an extension uγ of γ to the unit
disk D by
uγ

reit
:= expγ (0)

rv(t)

,
0 ≤r ≤1,
where v(t) is deﬁned by the equation γ (t) = expγ (0)(v(t)). Then
a(γ ) =

D
u∗
γ ω.

2.3
Isoperimetric Inequality, Monotonicity Lemma, Removal of Singularities
179
If π2(W) ̸= 0 and if ω is not exact the action depends on the choice of uγ , and we
should rather write a(uγ ). If the loop γ lies in a geodesic ball it is understood that
uγ is chosen as above.
Here is the ‘traditional’ isoperimetric inequality:
Theorem 2.64 (Isoperimetric inequality) Assume (W,ω) is a compact symplectic
manifold with ω-compatible almost complex structure J . Then the following holds:
For every constant c > 1
4π there is a constant δ > 0 such that
ℓ(γ ) < δ
⇒
a(γ )
 ≤cℓ2(γ )
for every smooth loop γ : S1 →W.
Because we are also considering curves with boundary we will need a slightly
more general result. Theorem 2.64 is a special case of the following result (choosing
N = 1).
Theorem 2.65 (Isoperimetric inequality-enhanced version)
Assume (W,ω) is a
compact symplectic manifold with ω-compatible almost complex structure J . More-
over, let L ⊂W be a compact Lagrangian submanifold.10 Let D = {z ∈C||z| < 1},
N ∈N and Ik = {eit | 2π
N (k −1) ≤t ≤2π
N k} ⊂∂D for k = 1,...,N. Assume
u ∈C∞(D,W)∩C0(D,W) with u|∂D piecewise smooth so that u(z) ∈L for z ∈Ik
with k even. Let η be the union of all the curves u(Ik) for odd k. Then the follow-
ing holds: For every c > 1/2π (or c > 1/4π in the case where N = 1) there is a
constant δ > 0 such that
a(u)
 ≤cℓ2(η)
provided the image of u lies in some geodesic ball with radius δ.
Proof In the case where N = 1 we have η = u(∂D), and there is no boundary condi-
tion. This case is a bit easier, so we will merely indicate how to modify the argument
to accommodate it.
Step 1: We ﬁrst carry out the proof for the case where W = R2n ≈Cn endowed
with the standard symplectic structure ω0, L = Rn and J0 = i.
10In the case where J is merely ω-tame we need to demand in addition that JT L ⊂T W|L is a
Lagrangian subbundle. This is automatically satisﬁed if J is ω-compatible, but not in the tame case
as the following easy example shows: Take the standard symplectic form ω = dx1 ∧dy1 + dx2 ∧
dy2 on R4 = {(x1,y1,x2,y2)} and the Lagrangian subspace L = R × {0} × R × {0}. Then
J =

The following discussion will be applied to the paths u|Ik for odd k later on. Let
γ be a smooth path
γ : [0,π] →Cn,
γ (0),γ (π) ∈Rn.
We will extend it to a continuous piecewise smooth loop γ : [0,2π] →Cn
by connecting γ (π) with γ (0) as follows. If γ (t) = γ (1)(t) + iγ (2)(t) with
γ (1)(t),γ (2)(t) ∈Rn then we deﬁne for π ≤t ≤2π
γ (1)(t) := γ (1)(2π −t),
γ (2)(t) := −γ (2)(2π −t)
which is possible since γ (0),γ (π) ∈Rn. We also denote this loop by γ . We expand
γ in a Fourier series
γ (t) :=

k∈Z
γkeikt
with γk ∈Rn.11 Then
˙γ (t) =

k∈Z\{0}

We consider the 1-form
λ(x)v := 1
2ω0(v,x),
x,v ∈R2n
so that
dλ = −ω0
and
λ(x)v ≡0
whenever x,v ∈Rn.

Pick a constant c >

2π . For every x ∈W we pick a Darboux chart φx : Ux ⊂
Ux ⊂Vx →R2n which means that (φ−1
x )∗ω = ω0 with the standard symplectic
form ω0 and φx(L) = Rn in the case where x ∈L. We choose ﬁnitely many of these
charts Ux1,...,Uxm such that they cover W. The collection has a Lebesgue number
δ0 > 0 by Lemma 2.34. We pick now a number 0 < δ < δ0. Then for any point
x0 ∈W we have Bδ(x0) ⊂V , where φ : V →R2n is one of the Darboux charts.
Choosing δ smaller we may also assume that

ball Bδ(x0) which in turn lies inside one of the Darboux charts V . Also, J0 is an
ω0-compatible complex structure on R2n. In particular, it can be used in lieu of i in
step 1. We estimate how much the coordinate chart φ : V →R2n distorts the length

We now proceed with the removal of singularities theorem:
Theorem 2.68 (Removal of singularities)
Let (W,ω) be a compact symplectic
manifold, let L ⊂W be a compact Lagrangian submanifold and let J be an ω-
compatible almost complex structure. Let u either be a J -holomorphic curve deﬁned
on the punctured disk D\{0} or on the punctured half-disk D+\{0} in which case we
also demand that u(D+ ∩R) ⊂L. In both cases we assume that E(u) < ∞. Then
u extends smoothly over the origin.

W 1,p(D+,RN) and u is Hölder continuous on D+. The regularity estimate Propo-
sition 2.32 also holds for maps u of class W k,p, and we obtain the result that u is in
fact smooth.
□
We now prove the monotonicity lemma. We refer to [30] for the classical version
without boundary condition which follows from our version by setting N = 1. Up
to some minor modiﬁcations our proof is the one from [46].

Proposition 2.69 (Monotonicity Lemma)
Let (W,ω) be a compact symplectic
manifold, E0 > 0, let J be an ω-compatible almost complex structure and let
L ⊂W be a Lagrangian submanifold. Let D = {z ∈C||z| < 1}, N ∈N and
Ik = {eit | 2π
N (k −1) ≤t ≤2π
N k} ⊂∂D for k = 1,...,N.
Then there are constants δ0,c0 > 0 such that the following holds: Let u : D →W
be a J -holomorphic disk with E(u) ≤E0 < ∞so that u(Ik) ⊂L for k even. Let
z0 ∈D\
k I2k+1 and 0 < r < δ0 so that u(
k I2k+1) ⊂W\Br(u(z0)). Then

u(D)∩Br(u(z0))
ω ≥c0r2.
Remark 2.70 The name ‘Monotonicity lemma’ comes from the theory of minimal
surfaces. If Σ is a minimal surface in Euclidean space and if x0 ∈Σ then the func-
tion
r −→1
r2 area

Σ ∩Br(x0)

,
r > 0
is monotone increasing as long as Σ is relatively closed in Br(x0). In particular, it
is larger than its limit for r ↘0 which is π, and we conclude that
area

Σ ∩Br(x0)

≥πr2.
The latter formula is the assertion of Proposition 2.69. In the Symplectic Geometry
literature this is usually called the Monotonicity lemma.
Proof We choose c >
1
2π and 0 < δ0 < min{ru(z0),δ} where ru(z0) denotes the in-
jectivity radius at the point u(z0) and δ is the positive constant corresponding to c
such that the isoperimetric inequality, Theorem 2.65, holds. Then let 0 < r < δ0 be
as in the lemma. We consider the following function:
f : D −→[0,∞)
f (z) := dist

u(z),u(z0)

,
where we use the Riemannian metric g := ω◦(Id×J) in order to deﬁne the distance
function on W. The function f is differentiable away from the set f −1(0). Indeed,
the function F : Br(u(z0)) →[0,∞), which yields the distance from the point u(z0)
is given by
F(expu(z0) ζ) = |ζ|
which is differentiable except at ζ = 0, and F ◦u = f . Consider now the compact
set Γ ⊂D of all critical points of f and all points where f equals zero, i.e.
Γ :=

z ∈D |df (z) = 0

∪f −1(0).

188

The set f (Γ ) ⊂[0,r] is also compact and has measure zero by Sard’s theorem.
Deﬁne now the following function:
a(ρ) :=

u(D)∩Bρ(u(z0))
ω =

f −1([0,ρ])
u∗ω
which is differentiable in points ρ /∈f (Γ ). Let ρ be such a point, and let Iρ ⊂(0,r)
be an open interval which does not intersect f (Γ ). Since u is pseudoholomorphic,
its derivative either has rank zero or rank two. In points z ∈f −1(Iρ) the rank cannot
be zero. Therefore, the pullback (u∗g)z is not degenerate. Hence we may deﬁne the
gradient ∇f (z) ∈TzD of f with respect to the metric u∗g in these points, i.e.
df (z)ζ = g

u(z)

Du(z)ζ,Du(z)∇f (z)

We leave it as an exercise to the reader to prove that

We also need a version of the Monotonicity Lemma for the case where (W,ω)
is the symplectization (R × M,d(ϕλ)) of a manifold M with contact form λ. Here,
ϕ : R →[0,1] is a smooth function with positive derivative. We will consider the
following translation invariant metric on R × M:

where πλ : T M →kerλ is the projection along the Reeb-vector ﬁeld.
13Recall that we may choose c0 < √π as close to √π as we like at the expense of making δ0
smaller.

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Proposition 2.71 (Monotonicity Lemma in the Symplectization) Let M be a com-
pact manifold with contact form λ, let L ⊂M be a Legendrian submanifold and let
E0 > 0. We consider an almost complex structure ˜J on R×M as in (2.1), page 103.
Let D = {z ∈C||z| < 1}, N ∈N and Ik = {eit | 2π
N (k −1) ≤t ≤2π
N k} ⊂∂D for
k = 1,...,N.
Then there are constants δ0,c0 > 0 such that the following holds: Let ˜u : D →
R × M be a ˜J -holomorphic disk with E(˜u) ≤E0 < ∞so that ˜u(Ik) ⊂R × L
for k even. Let z0 ∈D\
k I2k+1 and 0 < r < δ0 so that ˜u(
k I2k+1) ⊂(R ×
M)\Br(u(z0)).
Then we have
E(˜u|˜u−1(Br(˜u(z0)))) ≥c0r2.
Proof Recall that the energy is given by
E(˜u) = sup
ϕ∈Σ

D
˜u∗d(ϕλ),
where Σ = {ϕ : R →[0,1]|ϕ′ ≥0}.
If we impose the additional condition ˜u(z0) ∈{0} × M then the conclusion from
the original monotonicity lemma, Proposition 2.69, holds because we are then deal-
ing with a compact portion of the symplectic manifold. In this case the Lagrangian
does not need to be R-invariant.
Denote translation by a constant c ∈R by Tc : R × M →R × M which is an
isometry for the metric (2.53) on R × M. Moreover, let ϕc(s) := ϕ(s + c), ˜uc :=
Tc ◦˜u. Then

˜uc(D)∩Br(˜uc(z0))
d(ϕλ) =

Tc(˜u(D)∩Br(˜u(z0)))

Taking the supremum over all functions ϕ ∈Σ concludes the proof.

Let Σ be a compact Riemann surface possibly with boundary, Γ ⊂Σ a ﬁnite set

be a ˜J-holomorphic curve in the symplectization of a closed contact manifold M
with ﬁnite energy. If Σ has nonempty boundary, we assume for now that u|∂(Σ\Γ )
satisﬁes the Lagrangian boundary condition R × L, where L ⊂M is a Legen-
drian submanifold. If p ∈Γ we denote by U an open neighborhood of p with
U ∩(Γ \{p}) = ∅, i.e. U does not contain any other punctures.
Deﬁnition 2.72 The point p ∈Γ is called a removable puncture if ∥a∥L∞(U) < ∞.
The point p is called a positive (negative) puncture if limz→p a(z) = +∞(−∞).
We denote by Γ ± ⊂Γ the sets of positive and negative punctures, respectively.
Remark 2.73 If p is a removable puncture then ˜u extends smoothly over the point
p by the removal of singularities theorem.
The following theorem asserts that punctures are either positive, negative or re-
movable. The case of interior punctures is contained in a result by Hofer, Wysocki
and Zehnder [34–36]. In Theorem 2.21 we described the behavior of ˜u near a non-
removable puncture in the case where Σ\Γ is a sphere with one puncture. Theo-
rem 2.54 describes the case where Σ\Γ is a disk with one puncture on the bound-
ary. In both cases the puncture must be positive. The argument presented here fol-
lows [78] and the outline in [36].
Theorem 2.74 (Classiﬁcation of punctures and asymptotic behavior near a punc-
ture) Let ˜u = (a,u) : Σ\Γ →R × M be a nonconstant ˜J-holomorphic curve with
ﬁnite energy and with boundary condition ˜u(∂Σ\Γ ) ⊂R × L where L ⊂M is a
Legendrian submanifold and where M is a closed manifold with contact form λ.
Then any p ∈Γ is either positive, negative or removable.
Assume that γε(p) ⊂Σ\{p} is a smooth family of simple curves which are closed
if p is an interior puncture and which have endpoints on ∂Σ\{p} if p is a bound-
ary puncture. We also assume that they shrink to the point p as ε →0. Then the
limit T = limε→0
,
γε(p) u∗λ exists. It is positive/negative if and only if p is a posi-
tive/negative puncture.
Moreover, every sequence ε′
k ↘0 has a subsequence (εk) such that u ◦γεk(p)
converges with all derivatives to a periodic orbit of period |T | in the case of an
interior puncture or a characteristic chord of length |T | in the case of a boundary
puncture.
Deﬁnition 2.75 The quantity limε→0
,
γε(p) u∗λ is called the charge of the punc-
ture p.
Proof Let p ∈Γ ∩
◦
Σ and let U be an open neighborhood of p in Σ. The U\{p} is
conformally equivalent to [s′,+∞)×S1 for some s′ ∈R via φ : (s,t) →e−2π(s+it).
Using the map φ we reparameterize ˜u|U\{p}, and we obtain a ˜J-holomorphic half-
cylinder ˜v = (b,v) similar to the one in (2.27). If p ∈Γ ∩∂Σ then we conformally
change the domain to [s′,+∞) × [0,1] such that v([s′,+∞) × {0,1}) ⊂R × L
as in (2.40). The next step is to establish a gradient bound for ˜v (the analogue of

192

Propositions 2.41 or 2.56) on the half-cylinder or half-strip. If sup[s′,+∞)×S1 |D ˜v| =
+∞then we can ﬁnd a sequence {(sk,tk)} with sk →+∞such that |D ˜v(sk,tk)| →
∞. We can carry out exactly the same bubbling argument as in Propositions 2.41
or 2.56, and we obtain ∥D ˜v∥C0 < +∞.
As in the proof of Theorems 2.21 or 2.54 we pick a sequence sk →+∞. We
deﬁne a sequence
˜vk(s,t) :=

b(s + sk,t) −b(sk,0),v(s + sk,t)

for s ≥s′ −sk, and after passing to a subsequence it converges in C∞
loc(R × S1) to
a ˜J -holomorphic cylinder or strip ˜w. We will continue the argument for the case
where ˜w is a ˜J -holomorphic strip because the case of a cylinder is very similar and
a bit easier. Let s0 ∈R and k so large that s0 + sk > s′.

hence it converges, and we denote the limit by T ∈R so that
T =

∀s0 ∈R.
(2.54)
We note that this limit does not depend on the choice of the sequence sk →+∞and
on the choice of s0. We conclude that the charge of a puncture is well-deﬁned. We
also have

R×[0,1]
w∗dλ = 0
which implies that w∗dλ ≡0 and that the image of w lies on some trajectory x of
the Reeb-vector ﬁeld.14 If x : R →M is not periodic then it is a diffeomorphism
onto its image and can be inverted. If x(R) ≈S1 then we can view x as a covering
map, and w can be lifted to a map f : R × [0,1] →R because R × [0,1] is simply
14We could follow the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.54 in order to derive a formula
for ˜w but we will use an alternative proof here.

connected. In any case, there is a smooth map f : R×[0,1] →R such that w(s,t) =
x(f (s,t)). Because ˜w = (c,w) is ˜J -holomorphic the map c+if : R×[0,1] →C is
holomorphic. Note that the functions f |R×{0} and f |R×{1} are constant, and we may
assume that f (s,0) ≡0. This follows from the facts that x(f (R × {0,1})) ⊂L,
that the set L ∩x(R) is discrete, and that any two points from this set must have
distance ≥δ from each other for some constant δ > 0 (there are no arbitrarily short
chords by the Legendrian neighborhood theorem (Theorem 2.18)). Because c + if
has bounded derivatives, we conclude that ∂s(c + if ) is a bounded holomorphic
function with boundary condition
∂s(c + if )

R × {0,1}

⊂R.
Applying Schwarz reﬂection we obtain a bounded entire holomorphic function
which has to be constant by Liouville’s theorem. Hence c + if is an afﬁne func-
tion, and the boundary condition together with f (s,0) ≡0, c(0,0) = 0 and (2.54)
implies that
f (s,t) = T t,
c(s,t) = T s
so that
˜w(s,t) =

T s,x(T t)

where x(0),x(T ) ∈L. We note that x may depend on the choice of the sequence

If T ̸= 0 then x is a characteristic chord, and in this case the sign of T determines
the sign of the puncture. It remains to understand the case where T = 0. In this
case the map ˜w is constant for any sequence sk →+∞(the constant, however,
may depend on the chosen sequence). If we can show that b is bounded then the
removal of singularities theorem can be applied, and the proof of the theorem is
complete. Arguing by contradiction we assume that b is not bounded. We can then
also assume that we have picked the sequence sk →+∞such that b(sk,t) →+∞
(the discussion for the case −∞is very similar, so we omit it).
After maybe passing to a subsequence we may assume that for any compact
interval I ⊂R there is an integer k0 such that b(sk,t) /∈I for all k ≥k0 and t ∈
[0,1]. Then for any R,c > 0 we can ﬁnd regular values r ≥R and r′ ∈[r +c,r +2c]
of b such that b−1(r) and b−1(r′) are (nonempty) unions of simple arcs in [s′,∞)×
[0,1] running from [s′,∞) × {0} to [s′,∞) × {1}.

We pick a region Ωr, contained in b−1([r,r′]), with boundary consisting of four
arcs γ −⊂b−1(r), γ + ⊂b−1(r′), δ0 ⊂[sk,∞) × {0} and δ1 ⊂[sk,∞) × {0}. Con-

but this contradicts the Monotonicity lemma, Theorem 2.69. This completes the
argument that in the case of a ﬁnite-energy surface, punctures are either positive,
negative or removable.
□
We will from now on ignore the removable punctures and consider them removed
so that Γ = Γ + ∪Γ −.
In Proposition 2.36 we used the fact that Σ\Γ ≈C. In fact, for general punctured
surfaces, the conditions E(˜u) < ∞and
,
u∗dλ = 0 do not imply that ˜u is constant
as the following simple example shows: If x is a T -periodic orbit of the Reeb-vector
ﬁeld then deﬁne

Show as an exercise that ˜η is ˜J -holomorphic and that
,
R×S1 η∗dλ = 0. Such a curve
is called a trivial (ﬁnite-energy) cylinder. The following theorem characterizes ˜J -
holomorphic curves ˜u = (a,u) with trivial dλ-energy (the case of a closed surface
has been proved in [36]):
Theorem 2.76 (Characterization of ﬁnite-energy curves with vanishing dλ-energy)
Let ˜u = (a,u) : Σ\Γ →R × M be a ˜J -holomorphic curve where Σ is a compact
Riemann surface, possibly with boundary, and where ∅̸= Γ = Γ + ∪Γ −⊂Σ is the
ﬁnite set of positive and negative punctures. Assume further that 0 < E(˜u) < ∞and
that
,
Σ u∗dλ = 0.
(1) If Γ ∩
◦
Σ̸= ∅then there is a nonconstant holomorphic map φ : Σ →S2 with
φ−1(+∞) = Γ +, φ−1(0) = Γ −and a periodic orbit x of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld
of period T = E(˜u) such that
˜u(z) = ˜η

φ(z)

,
where ˜η(e2π(s+it)) = (T s +c,x(tT )) is a ﬁnite-energy cylinder associated to x.
(2) If Γ ⊂∂Σ then there is a nonconstant holomorphic map φ : Σ →D, D =
{z ∈C : |z| ≤1}, with φ−1(+1) = Γ +, φ−1(−1) = Γ −and a characteristic
chord x : [0,T ] →M of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld with x(0),x(T ) ∈L, T = E(˜u)
such that
˜u(z) = ˜η

φ(z)

,
where ˜η(eπ(s+it)) = (T s + c,x(tT )) is a ﬁnite-energy strip associated to x.
Remark 2.77 Before we begin with the proof some remarks are in order. In case (2)
the chord x may actually be a periodic orbit with x(0) = x(T ) ∈L. In both cases T
need not be the minimal period or minimal length of x. We say T is the ‘minimal
length’ of the chord x : [0,T ] →M if x(t) /∈L if 0 < t < T .
Proof Because ˜u is ˜J -holomorphic the integrand in
,
Σ u∗dλ is positive so that
u∗dλ ≡0. This implies that there is a trajectory x of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld so that
u(Σ\Γ ) ⊂x(R). If x is not periodic then there is a smooth function f : ˙S →R
such that u = x ◦f . We discuss case (1) ﬁrst. If p ∈Γ is an interior puncture, and
if C is a closed curve in Σ\Γ with winding number 1 with respect to p then

C
u∗λ ̸= 0
by Theorem 2.74. This leads to a contradiction because u = x ◦f would imply that
this integral is zero. We conclude that x must be periodic. Let T ′ > 0 be the period
of x. Then we can deﬁne a smooth map
f : Σ\Γ →R/T Z

by u(z) = x(f (z)) and a smooth map h = a + if : Σ\Γ →R × R/T Z. The map h

Compactifying the cylinder by adding two points 0 and ∞we extend h to a holo-
morphic function h : Σ →S2 such that h−1(0) = Γ −and h−1(∞) = Γ +. Setting
now
η : S2 = (R × R/T Z) ∪{0,∞} →R × M


we obtain ˜u(z) = η(h(z)). We get the formula stated in the theorem by scaling the
cylinder R × R/T Z to the cylinder R × R/Z.
In case (2) the trajectory x is either periodic, and we proceed as before. Other-
wise, we obtain a harmonic function f : Σ\Γ →R. Note that the function f is
constant on connected components of ∂Σ\Γ and f (∂Σ\Γ ) = {T1,...,Tk} with
k ≥2, 0 = T1 < ··· < Tk = T . Because f cannot have any local extrema its image
is contained in the interval [0,T ].

2.4 Finite-Energy Strips and Cylinders of Small Area
In this section we will describe the behavior of a ﬁnite-energy cylinder or ﬁnite-
energy strip with boundary condition R × L in the symplectization of a closed
contact manifold if the dλ-energy of the cylinder/strip is sufﬁciently small and if
the cylinder/strip is sufﬁciently long. The results concerning ﬁnite-energy cylinders
are from the paper [38]. We describe the general setting for this section: M is a
closed manifold with contact form λ. A ﬁnite-energy cylinder (or strip) will be a
˜J -holomorphic curve in R × M deﬁned on R × S1 (or R × [0,1]) with the usual
deﬁnition for an almost complex structure ˜J on T (R × M) and with ﬁnite energy
E(˜u) < ∞. In the case of a strip we are imposing the boundary condition R × L
where L ⊂M is a Legendrian submanifold.
Deﬁnition 2.78 (Action spectrum) Let P′ = P′
λ ⊂R be the set consisting of 0
and all the numbers T such that there exists a T -periodic orbit of the Reeb-vector
ﬁeld Xλ. Also, let P′′ = P′′
λ,L be the set consisting of 0 and all numbers T such that
there is a characteristic chord x of length T , i.e. x(0),x(T ) ∈L and ˙x = Xλ(x). We
call P, the union of the two above sets, the action spectrum of the contact form λ.
Sometimes we also refer to the sets P′,P′′ as action spectra.

We assume that all periodic orbits of Xλ and characteristic chords are non-
degenerate, hence for each E0 > 0 there are only ﬁnitely many of them with pe-

The numbers γ ′
0 is the smallest gap between any two periods (including zero) among
the (nondegenerate) periodic orbits of period no larger than E0. The number γ ′′
0
plays the same role for the lengths of the nondegenerate characteristic chords of
length no more than E0. It is necessary in (2.55) above to consider only periodic
orbits/chords with length or period bounded above by some constant. Otherwise,
if we consider two periodic orbits whose periods have irrational ratio and all their
iterates then

The following theorem shows that there is a distinguished point in the action spec-
trum for each long ﬁnite-energy cylinder and ﬁnite-energy strip with sufﬁciently
small dλ-energy.
Theorem 2.79
Let E0 and let γ0 be as in (2.55). Moreover, let γ ∈(0,γ0) and
σ ∈(0,γ0 −γ ). Then there is a constant h0 > 0 such that the following holds: For
every R > h0 and every ˜J -holomorphic strip

(2.57)
A similar statement is true for ˜J-holomorphic cylinders ˜u : [−R,R]×S1 →R×M:
It sufﬁces to require 0 < γ < γ ′
0 in this case, and we obtain A(˜u) ∈P′.
15The number A(˜u) is also called the center action of the strip ˜u.

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Proof The proofs for ˜J-holomorphic cylinders and strips are virtually identical. We
only present the version for strips. We claim that for every δ > 0 there is a constant
C > 0 such that
sup
D ˜u(s,t)
 : (s,t) ∈[−R + δ,R −δ] × [0,1]

≤C
for all R > δ
for all ﬁnite-energy strips satisfying (2.56). If the claim was false then there would
be δ0 > 0, sequences ck →+∞, Rk > δ0 and ˜J -holomorphic strips {˜uk} deﬁned
on [−Rk,Rk] × [0,1] satisfying (2.56) and sup[−Rk+δ0,Rk−δ0]×[0,1] |D ˜uk| > ck. We
could proceed with a bubbling-off argument as in the proof of Propositions 2.41
and 2.56. This would produce either a nonconstant ﬁnite-energy plane ˜v = (b,v) or
a ﬁnite-energy half-plane with boundary condition R × L. In each case the ‘asymp-
totic limit’ (in the sense of Theorems 2.21 and 2.54) x(t) has period or length
γ ≥T > 0 where
T =

C
v∗dλ
or
T =

H + v∗dλ.
Since γ < γ0, there cannot be any such periodic orbit or characteristic chord x. This
contradiction proves the claim.
In order to prove Theorem 2.79, we again proceed indirectly. Then there are
sequences Rn →+∞, ˜J -holomorphic strips ˜un = (an,un) : [−Rn,Rn] × [0,1] →
R × M satisfying inequalities (2.56) and in addition

 1

∀T ∈P′′.
(2.58)
Then, by the claim above, for every δ > 0 there is a constant C > 0 such that for
all n for which Rn > δ we have
sup
[−Rn+δ,Rn−δ]×[0,1]
|D ˜un| ≤C.
After passing to a subsequence, by the Ascoli–Arzela theorem and the regular-
ity estimate, the sequence {˜un} will converge in C∞
loc(R × [0,1],R × M) to a ˜J -
holomorphic strip ˜u = (a,u) : R × [0,1] →R × M which satisﬁes

We view the map ˜u as a disk with two boundary punctures. Then a puncture is
either removable, or ˜u approaches asymptotically a strip over a characteristic chord
by Theorem 2.74. In either case the limits

exist and they belong to the action spectrum P′′. Moreover, they are zero in the case
of a removable singularity, and they equal the length of the characteristic chord in
the asymptotic limit otherwise. By Stokes’ theorem

By deﬁnition of γ0 we must have T = T−= T+. If T = 0 then by the removal of
singularity theorem (Theorem 2.68) ˜u smoothly extends to the disk D and
E(˜u) = sup
φ∈Σ


˜u∗d(φλ) = sup


∂D
φ(a)u∗λ = 0
by Stokes’ theorem and the boundary condition, hence ˜u is constant contradicting
(2.60). Therefore, T ̸= 0 and ˜u is not constant. Applying Theorem 2.76 we get
˜u(s,t) =

T s + c,x(T t)

for some constant c ∈R and some characteristic chord x of length T . We compute
 1
0
u(0,•)∗λ −T = 0
again contradicting (2.60). This completes the existence proof for h0 > 0 and
A(˜u) ∈P′′. As for uniqueness, assume that there are T1,T2 ∈P′′ satisfying the
estimate (2.57). Then
|T1 −T2| < σ
2 + σ
2 < γ0 −γ < γ0
and by deﬁnition of γ0 we obtain T1 = T2.
□
Remark 2.80 It follows from the deﬁnition of γ0 that either A(˜u) = 0 or |A(˜u)| ≥γ0.
We may assume that A(˜u) ≥γ0 after replacing ˜u(s,t) with the ˜J -holomorphic
strip ˜u(−s,−t). In the case of a ﬁnite-energy cylinder we either have A(˜u) = 0 or
A(˜u) ≥γ ′
0.
If ˜u is a ﬁnite-energy strip (or cylinder) as in Theorem 2.79 then the associated
central action A(˜u) is either zero, or it equals the action of some characteristic chord
(or period of some periodic orbit). In the second case we will show that the image
of ˜u has to remain near some characteristic chord (or periodic orbit, respectively).
In the ﬁrst case, where A(˜u) = 0, the image of ˜u stays inside a small neighborhood
of the point ˜u(0,0), as the following result shows:

200

Pseudoholomorphic Curves
Theorem 2.81 Let E0,γ0,γ and h0 be as in Theorem 2.79. Then for every ε > 0
there is a number h1 ≥h0 such that for every R > h1 and every ﬁnite-energy strip
˜u = (a,u) : [−R,R] × [0,1] →R × M with
A(˜u) = 0,
E(˜u) ≤E0,


we have
˜u


˜u(0,0)

.
The same conclusion holds for ﬁnite-energy cylinders ˜u = (a,u) : [−R,R] × S1 →
R × M satisfying the above assumptions.
We need the following lemma:
Lemma 2.82 Let E0,γ0,γ and h0 be as in Theorem 2.79. For every δ > 0 there is
a constant h ≥h0 such that for every R > h and every ˜J -holomorphic strip or cylin-
der ˜u on [−R,R] × [0,1] (or [−R,R] × S1, respectively) satisfying the hypotheses
from Theorem 2.79 with A(˜u) = 0 the curves ˜u(s,•) satisfy
(1) supt,t′ d(˜u(s,t), ˜u(s,t′)) ≤δ
(2) |λ(˜u(s,•))∂t ˜u(s,•)| ≤δ
for all −R + h ≤s ≤R −h.
Proof Again, the proofs for the cases of a ﬁnite-energy strip and a ﬁnite-energy
cylinder are identical, hence we only consider one of the two cases. We only prove
the ﬁrst assertion and leave the second as an exercise to the reader. If the ﬁrst asser-
tion was false then we could ﬁnd a positive constant δ0 and sequences Rn ≥n + h0,

Proof of Theorem 2.81 Pick ε > 0. The monotonicity lemma in the symplectiza-

ery ˜J -holomorphic cylinder ˜w : [−K,K] × S1 →R × M and every point p ∈
(−K,K) × S1 and 0 < r < r0 for which ˜w({±K} × S1) ∩Br( ˜w(p)) = ∅we have
E( ˜w| ˜w−1(Br( ˜w(p)))) ≥Cr2.
Similarly, if ˜w : [−K,K]×[0,1] →R×M is a ˜J-holomorphic strip with boundary
condition w([−K,K] × {0,1}) ⊂L, and if p ∈(−K,K) × [0,1] and 0 < r < r0
so that ˜w({±K} × [0,1]) ∩Br( ˜w(p)) = ∅then we also have E( ˜w| ˜w−1(Br( ˜w(p)))) ≥

If the center action is not zero, a long ﬁnite-energy cylinder with small dλ-energy
is close to a periodic orbit of the Reeb-vector ﬁeld, and a long ﬁnite-energy strip with
small dλ-energy is close to a characteristic chord.

or a ˜J -holomorphic strip satisfying the same conditions including u([−R,R] ×

Proof The group S1 acts naturally on C∞(S1,R×M) by (e2πiθ ∗x)(t) := x(t +θ).
By the nondegeneracy assumption on the contact form there are only ﬁnitely many
periodic orbits of Xλ up to the S1-action. Let U be an S1-invariant neighborhood

of the (ﬁnitely many)periodic orbits. We also choose U so small that each of its
connected components contains only one periodic orbit (modulo S1-action). In the
case of a strip we proceed in the same way, each connected component of U contains
precisely one characteristic chord.
We prove the theorem indirectly. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence Rn ≥n+h0 where
h0 is chosen such that Theorem 2.79 holds and a sequence {˜un} of ˜J -holomorphic

The following is the main result of the paper [38]:
Theorem 2.84 Let E0,γ0,γ,σ and h0 be as in Theorem 2.79. Then there are con-
stants δ0,cα,μ and ν < min{4π,2μ} such that the following holds: Given δ ∈(0,δ0]
there is a constant h ≥h0 so that for every R > h and every ﬁnite-energy cylinder

bit x(R) ≈S1 × {0} such that u(s,t) ∈U whenever (s,t) ∈[−R + h,R −h] × S1.
Using the covering R →S1 = R/Z the map ˜u is in local coordinates R × U repre-
sented by

We have only proved the ﬁrst part of the theorem without the estimates in coordi-
nates near the periodic orbit. The proof of the second assertion would require about
13 lemmas and we refer the reader to the original paper. The estimates should also
hold in the case of a ˜J -holomorphic strip satisfying similar assumptions. We would
like to note the following direct consequence of Theorem 2.84 (see Theorem 1.4
and Corollary 1.5 in [38]). Here, we view M as embedded into some Rm, so that
C∞(S1,M) inherits a metric from the Fréchet space C∞(S1,Rm)

Chapter 3
The SFT Compactness Results
We will describe now the compactiﬁcation of the moduli space of holomorphic
curves. The elements which have to be added are called ‘holomorphic buildings’.
In order to keep the notation more manageable we will ﬁrst present the case of holo-
morphic curves without boundary (‘the closed case’) as in the article [12]. We will
later present a modiﬁcation of the construction in order to accommodate holomor-
phic curves with boundary.
3.1 Holomorphic Buildings for Curves Without Boundary
3.1.1 Holomorphic Buildings of Height 1
Let
S = (S,j,M ∪Z,D)
be a noded Riemann surface. The set of marked points consists of a set Z, called
punctures and a set M which we will call marked points. This is a slight change
in notation from Chap. 1 where we denoted the set of marked points simply by M.
In this chapter we want to distinguish between different kinds of marked points: The
domains of the holomorphic curves will be the surface S with some marked points
removed. We will call these points ‘punctures’ and use the notation Z for them. The
set of the remaining marked points will be denoted by M. The set
D =

{d1,d1},...,{dk,dk}

⊂
◦
S
is called the sets of nodal pairs or special marked points. Each pair {dj,dj} may
belong to the same or to different components of S. The set D is usually consid-
ered unordered. We consider the set of marked points and punctures to be ordered.
We assume that R × V is the symplectization of a closed manifold V endowed
with some contact form λ, and where J is a dλ compatible complex structure on
ξ = kerλ.

The SFT Compactness Results
Deﬁnition 3.1 A holomorphic curve
˜u = (a,u) : S\Z −→R × V
is called a trivial cylinder if S = S2, M = D = ∅, Z consists of exactly two points,
and u maps S onto a periodic orbit of the Reeb vector ﬁeld.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (Holomorphic building of height 1) A holomorphic curve
˜u = (a,u) : S\Z −→R × V
is called a holomorphic building of height 1 if it has ﬁnite energy, and if for all nodal
pairs
˜u(dj) = ˜u(dj).
Such a curve is called stable if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
• at least one component of the curve is not a trivial cylinder.
• If S′ is a connected component of S on which ˜u is constant, then the Riemann
surface S′ with all its marked points, punctures and nodal pairs is stable in the
sense of Deﬁnition 1.17.
Assume that p is a puncture. Under some nondegeneracy assumptions on the set
of periodic orbits of the Reeb vector ﬁeld, the asymptotic behavior of ˜u is given
by Proposition 2.47. We may then associate a particular periodic orbit of the Reeb
vector ﬁeld to each such puncture.
As in [12] we will call two such curves (˜u = (a,u),j,S) and (˜u′ = (a′,u′),j′,S′)
equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism φ : S →S′ such that
• (φ∗)−1 ◦j′ ◦φ∗= j
• φ sends the sets M,Z,D onto the sets M′,Z′,D′ preserving the ordering of the
sets
• u′ ◦φ = u
• a′ ◦φ −a is locally constant.
The last condition means that we identify curves which differ by translation in the
R-direction. The R-component at each puncture either tends to +∞or to −∞(see
Theorem 2.74). We will use the notation Z± to distinguish between positive and
negative punctures. The question of ordering sets of marked points and the notion of
equivalence of noded surfaces or equivalence of holomorphic curves only becomes
relevant if algebraic invariants are constructed from the compactiﬁed moduli spaces
of holomorphic curves. This is not the subject of this text, we only deal with the
compactness theory.

3.1.2 Holomorphic Buildings of Height N
Assume, we have N stable possibly disconnected holomorphic buildings of
height 1 (˜uk,jk,Sk)1≤k≤N where ˜uk = (ak,uk) : Sk\Zk →R × V and Sk =
(Sk,Mk ∪Zk,Dk) are noded Riemann surfaces. We denote by Γ ±
k the sets of bound-
ary circles added to Sk\Zk by compactifying the punctures in Z±
k . We assume that
#Z−
k+1 = #Z+
k ,
i.e. the building on level k + 1 has as many negative punctures as the building on
level k positive punctures. We assume furthermore that there are orientation revers-
ing diffeomorphisms

Using these we may construct a piecewise smooth surface with boundary

els) if the following condition is satisﬁed: The maps uk : SZk

together to a continuous map u : SZ,Φ →V . This means that the curve uk is asymp-

punctures (see Fig. 3.1).

i.e.
Φ′

(1) There are sequences of extra marked points for the surfaces Sm and S such that
all the surfaces have the same number of boundary and interior marked points
and the underlying Riemann surfaces become stable.
(2) The surfaces Sm converge to the surface S in the Deligne–Mumford sense (af-

in Sect. 1.3 of the chapter on Riemann surfaces (see Deﬁnition 1.87). De-

Adding Additional Marked Points

3.2 Adding Additional Marked Points
In this section we are considering a convergent sequence of noded marked Riemann
surfaces Sn = (Sn,jn,Mn,Dn) of signature (g,μ). In this section we are using
the notation of Chap. 2 where we do not use any particular notation for the punc-
tures. See Deﬁnitions 1.10 and 1.87 for the notions of signature and convergence
of surfaces. If these surfaces have nonempty boundary, we write Mn = Mint
n ∪M∂
n,
Dn = Dint
n ∪D∂
n where Mint
n
is the set of interior marked points while M∂
n denotes
the set of the marked points on the boundary of Sn (similarly for the special marked
points or nodal pairs Dn). In the case of nonempty boundary we have μ = (μint,μ∂)
where μint = #Mint and μ∂= #M∂. Denote the limit by S = (S,j,M,D) (its signa-
ture is also (g,μ), and we write again M = Mint ∪M∂, D = Dint ∪D∂if ∂S ̸= ∅).
We will now change the sequence by adding two additional marked points to each
surface Sn: Let Yn = {y(1)
n ,y(2)
n } be a pair of points on Sn\(Mn ∪Dn) such that
dn

y(1)
n ,y(2)
n
 n→∞
−→0
where dn is the distance function with respect to the Poincaré metric hjn,Mn∪Dn
on ˙Sn := Sn\(Mn ∪Dn). We also assume that there is a sequence of positive real
numbers Rn →∞and injective holomorphic maps
ψn : DRn →˙Sn,
DRn := {z ∈C||z| ≤Rn}
such that
ψn(0) = y(1)
n
and
ψn(1) = y(2)
n
if the points y(1)
n ,y(2)
n
are in the interior of Sn. The other case we will consider is
when both lie on the boundary ∂Sn. Then the injective holomorphic maps ψn will
be deﬁned on the upper half-disk D+
Rn. After passing to a subsequence we may as-
sume that the sequence S′
n := (Sn,jn,Mn ∪Yn,Dn) also converges to some limit
S′ = (S′,j′,M′,D′). The purpose of this section is to ﬁnd how S′ and S are related.
In a nutshell, S′ is obtained from S by attaching no, one or two spheres (or disks)
to S. This will be very important for the SFT compactness result later since this
will help us analyze bubbling phenomena. The result we are going to discuss here is
Proposition 4.3 in [12] and its generalization for the case of surfaces with nonempty
boundary. It would be very cumbersome to precisely formulate the result, we rather
describe and illustrate the phenomena (hoping this may be more illuminating). We
will ﬁrst consider the case of surfaces without boundary as in [12]. There are ad-
ditional complications if the surfaces Sn have boundary, and we will address these
later.
Recall that the Deligne–Mumford compactness result, Theorem 1.91, was proved
along the following lines: Using Bers’ theorem we may decompose the surfaces
Sn\(Mn ∪Dn) into pairs of pants so that the corresponding Fenchel–Nielsen pa-
rameters converge after passing to a subsequence. Because of the assumption
dn(y(1)
n ,y(2)
n ) →0 we may at this point assume that the surfaces Sn\(Mn ∪Dn)
consist of either one or two pairs of pants (see Fig. 3.2). Introducing the additional

214
3
The SFT Compactness Results
Fig. 3.2 The surface
Sn\(Mn ∪Dn)
marked points Yn amounts to changing the hyperbolic metric and therefore the pair
of pants decomposition (see Fig. 3.3 for the case where both additional points are
contained in the same pairs of pants). We invite the reader to draw the correspond-
ing pictures for the case where Sn\(Mn ∪Dn) consists of two pairs of pants (and to
construct case (iii) from Fig. 5 in the paper [12]). Because the surfaces ˙Sn contain
annuli ψn(DRn\D2) with larger and larger moduli and y(1)
n ,y(2)
n
∈ψn(D2) the last
pair of pants decomposition depicted in Fig. 3.3 (and similar scenarios) cannot occur
by Bers’ theorem. In fact, we must have ℓ(γn) →0, and the limit surface S′ contains
an additional spherical component with two marked points on it corresponding to
the sequences {y(1)
n } and {y(2)
n }. In the case where infn ℓ(δn) > 0 the limit S′ differs
from S by exactly one additional spherical component.3 If in addition ℓ(δn) →0
then a second spherical component may appear as well (see Fig. 3.4).4 If we replace
the marked point m in Fig. 3.4 by a nondegenerate boundary component then we
may obtain limits S′ which differ from S by adding one spherical component and
pinching a closed curve to a point. See Fig. 3.5 for an illustration where the se-
quence Sn is assumed to be constant for simplicity and ℓ(γn),ℓ(δn) →0. This case
is missing in the paper [12].
Let us consider the boundary case where the sequences {y(1)
n },{y(2)
n } lie in
∂Sn\(M∂
n ∪D∂
n). Recall from our discussion of the Deligne–Mumford result that
we double the surfaces Sn and then decompose the doubled surfaces into pairs of
pants. As before, we will assume that y(1)
n
and y(2)
n
lie in the same pair of pants Y.
The intersection ∂Sn ∩Y consists of a union of geodesic arcs connecting two bound-
ary components and maybe some boundary components of the pair of pants Y (see
Figs. 1.52 and 1.55). Figure 3.6 illustrates some of the a priori possible scenar-
ios. We then need to repeat the previous discussion and keep track of the boundary
curve(s). Pictures (IV) and (V) actually lead to unstable components in the limiting
nodal surface which we wish to avoid. We therefore require that the points y(1)
n
and
y(2)
n
lie in the same component of ∂Sn ∩Y. Adding two marked points to the bound-
ary has the effect of adding one or two additional components to the limit surface
which are disks. Figure 3.7 depicts the situation for picture (II).
3In the paper [12] this is case (i) in Fig. 5 and the second case in Fig. 3.4.
4This is case (ii) in the paper [12].

3.3.1 Statement of the Result
We will formulate and prove the SFT compactness result for holomorphic curves
without boundary where the target is a cylindrical symplectic manifold (W,ω), i.e.
W = R × M where M is a closed contact manifold and ˜J equals the usual R-
invariant almost complex structure (with dλ-compatible J : kerλ →kerλ) We also
assume throughout that the contact form on M is non-degenerate.

and the pair of pants is depicted by the fat curve(s)
Zn = {z(n)
1 ,...,z(n)
p−} are all negative while the punctures Zn = {z(n)
1 ,...,z(n)
p+} are
all positive. We also assume that all the curves ˜un are asymptotic at the correspond-
ing punctures to the same periodic orbits.5 Then there exists a subsequence of {Cn}
which converges to a stable holomorphic building of height k ≥1.
It is not a restriction to treat only convergence of smooth curves (smooth meaning
that Sn is not noded) because we may just include nodal points in the sets Mn of
marked points. We divide the proof into several steps.
5This is not a real assumption since it can be achieved by merely passing to a suitable subsequence
due to the uniform bound on the energy and the nondegeneracy of the contact form. In the pa-
per [12] the authors also consider the Morse–Bott case for curves without boundary. Then one has
to assume that all the curves ˜un are asymptotic at the corresponding punctures to periodic orbits
lying in the same connected component in the space of periodic orbits.

3.3.2 Gradient Bounds
Let {Cn} be a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves as in Theorem 3.6. We will
establish a uniform gradient bound on the ε-thick parts of Sn after removing ﬁnitely
many points. This statement is more subtle than it seems at ﬁrst sight. The magni-
tude of the gradient ∥∇˜un(z)∥= sup|ζ|=1 ∥Dun(z)ζ∥depends on the metric on the
surface Sn. On the other hand, removing points from the surface Sn alters the met-
ric on Sn. The statement made here is that the procedure of successively removing
pairs of points from the surface whenever the gradient blows up necessarily termi-
nates after ﬁnitely many steps resulting in a uniform gradient bound. Here is the
precise statement:
Proposition 3.7 (Gradient bounds after removing ﬁnitely many points) There is an
integer K ≥0 and a constant C > 0 which only depend on E0 and points

Proof By the Deligne–Mumford compactness result we may assume after passing
to a subsequence that the domains converge to some noded surface,
(Sn,jn,Mn,Zn ∪Zn) →(S,j,M,D,Z ∪Z).
The proof uses some kind of iteration argument. Assume that zn ∈˙Sn is a sequence
such that
lim
n→∞ρn(zn)
		∇˜un(zn)
		 = +∞
(3.2)
where ρn denotes the injectivity radius with respect to the hyperbolic metric on
˙Sn = Sn\(Mn ∪Zn ∪Zn), i.e. Yn = ∅. Let us ﬁrst consider the case where W =
R × M. Writing ˜un = (an,un) and replacing an with an −an(zn) we may assume
that an(zn) = 0 for all n.
We now claim that we can ﬁnd complex coordinate charts near the points zn
with some amount of control on the gradient which is the contents of the following
lemma.
Lemma 3.8 There are holomorphic charts ψn : D →Un ⊂( ˙Sn,jn) with ψn(0) =
zn if zn /∈∂˙Sn and positive constants C1,C2 such that for all z ∈D and all large n
C1ρn(zn) ≤
		∇ψn(z)
		 ≤C2ρn(zn).
(3.3)
Here, D ⊂C is the open unit disk and Un is some open neighborhood of zn. The
gradient is computed with respect to the Euclidean metric on D (or D+) and the
Poincaré metric hn on ˙Sn so that
		∇ψn(z)
		 = sup

.
Remark 3.9
We will later consider the case where ∂Sn ̸= ∅. If zn ∈∂˙Sn then
the same statement is true for a suitable holomorphic chart ψn : D+ →Un with
ψn(0) = zn, ψn(D+ ∩R) ⊂∂˙Sn and D+ = {z ∈D |Im(z) ≥0}. We note that the
proof of Lemma 3.8 in the boundary case is not any different from the interior case
because we double Riemann surfaces along their boundary.
Proof We consider the following two cases for subsequences {znk} ⊂{zn} and
0 < ε ≤sinh(1/2) < sinh−1(1) (we use the notation {zn} for a subsequence for
simplicity):
(1) ρn(zn) ≥ε
(2) ρn(zn) < ε,

220

The SFT Compactness Results
and we will establish the estimate (3.3) for a suitable number ε with constants
C1,C2 > 0 not depending on n.
Let 0 < ε ≤sinh(1/2). In case (1) we have zn ∈Thickε( ˙Sn), and the claim holds
for this subsequence (with constants depending on ε only and not on the particu-
lar choice of the subsequence): Using suitable diffeomorphisms we may consider
S instead of Sn with the hyperbolic metrics induced by the metrics hn (we de-
note these induced metrics again by hn), and we have hn →h and also ρn →ρ
on Thickε′( ˙S) for 0 < ε′ < ε. Hence we may view Thickε( ˙Sn) for large n as a
proper subset of Thickε′( ˙S). We then cover the compact set Thickε′( ˙S) with ﬁnitely
many holomorphic coordinate charts6 φk : D2 →S or φk : D+
2 →S such that
{φk(D),φk(D+)} cover Thickε′( ˙S). We have zn = φk(z0) for some k and |z0| ≤1.
Then take ψn := φk|D(z0) and the claim holds with constants C1,C2 depending on
ε but not on n. While discussing case (2) we will impose further restrictions on the
possible choices for ε.
Consider now the case (2) where zn ∈Thinε( ˙Sn). By the Thick–thin decompo-
sition, Theorem 1.85, every component of Thinε( ˙Sn) is isometric either to a cusp
or to a piece of a hyperbolic cylinder because ε ≤sinh−1(1). Let us assume ﬁrst
that the sequence {zn} lies in a component of the ε-thin part of the surface which
is isometric to a cusp. By Lemma 1.83 the injectivity radius ρ(p) at a point p of
the surface is given by half the length of the shortest geodesic loop through that
point. If z = s + it ∈C = {z ∈H : Im(z) ≥1/2}/{z ∼z + 1} is the standard cusp,
we obtain

The following statement is left as an exercise to the reader.
Exercise 3.10
Assume (S,j) is a Riemann surface, where j is induced by some
metric and some orientation, and let | · | be the corresponding norm on T S. Let
u : S →(W,ω,J) be a J -holomorphic curve where J is ω-compatible, and where
∥v∥2 := ωq(v,Jv) for v ∈TqW. With the notation
		∇u(z)

show that for any ζ ∈TzS with |ζ| = 1 we have
1
2
		∇u(z)
		 ≤
		Du(z)ζ
		.
We resume the proof of Proposition 3.7. Consider now the pseudoholomorphic
disks ˜un ◦ψn. Because of Lemma 3.8, Exercise 3.10 above and because ˜un is
˜J -holomorphic, we have for all unit vectors ζ ∈C:

for w ∈BεnRn(0)
which converge uniformly on compact sets with all derivatives to a nontrivial
˜J -holomorphic ﬁnite energy plane which we denote by ˜v∞. We claim that the en-
ergy of any such ˜v∞is bounded from below by a constant ℏ> 0. We identify the
domain of ˜v∞with S2\{point}. If the puncture is not removable then ˜v∞is asymp-
totic to a periodic orbit of the Reeb vector ﬁeld. Then the smallest period among

all periodic orbits of the Reeb vector ﬁelds at the cylindrical ends serves as a lower
bound. Otherwise, in the case of a removable puncture, we apply the mean value in-
equality (Proposition 2.59). It implies that a ˜J-holomorphic plane with image con-
tained in a compact subset C of the target symplectic manifold W and with energy
less than a certain constant ε0 = ε0(C) must be constant. Since W is the symplec-
tization of a closed contact manifold the constant ε0 actually does not depend on C
because the almost complex structure is R-invariant (look at Remark 2.60).
Remark 3.11 We insert a few brief remarks on how to modify the above argument
in the case of surfaces with boundary for later reference. Some of the notions men-
tioned here will be deﬁned in the next section. In this case the maps ˜un ◦ψn are
deﬁned on the half-disk, and we have boundary values in some Lagrangian sub-
manifold L ⊂W which is of the form R × L in the cylindrical part of W with
some Legendrian L ⊂M. The limit ˜v∞may also be a ﬁnite energy half-plane with
boundary values in L. We identify the domain of ˜v∞with D\{1}. If the puncture is
not removable then ˜v∞is asymptotic to a characteristic chord for the Legendrian L.
Then the smallest length among all characteristic chords serves as a lower bound
for the energy of ˜v∞. The mean value inequality can also be applied to a half-plane.
Since we only consider noncompact symplectic manifolds W with cylindrical ends
(or manifolds which arise from the splitting construction) the constant ε0 actually
does not depend on C because the almost complex structure on the cylindrical part
is R-invariant (see Remark 2.60).
We deﬁne now sequences
¯wn := ψn(wn),
¯un := ψn

wn + 1
Rn

which both lie in ψn(D) = Un ⊂˙Sn and which satisfy dn( ¯wn, ¯un) →0 where dn

using (3.3). Following Sect. 3.2 we now add {wn,un} as additional marked points to
the Riemann surfaces (Sn,jn,Mn,Zn∪Zn). After passing to a subsequence we may
assume that the sequence (Sn,jn,Mn ∪{ ¯wn, ¯un},Zn ∪Zn) converges to a noded
Riemann surface (S′,j′,M′,D′,Z′ ∪Z′) which differs from (S,j,M,D,Z ∪Z) by
one or two additional spherical components. Recalling the construction in Sect. 3.2
and the one of ˜v∞we see that one of the spherical components is the domain of ˜v∞,
and therefore has energy bounded from below by some positive constant ℏ.

We now repeat the above bubbling-off analysis generating again a ˜J -holomorphic
sphere or plane with energy bounded below by the same positive constant ℏ> 0 as
before. Recalling that the energy of the original sequence was uniformly bounded
we conclude that the above iteration must terminate after ﬁnitely many steps.
□
3.3.3 Convergence in the Thick Part
Assume that Cn = (˜un,Sn,jn,Mn,Zn ∪Zn) is a sequence as in Theorem 3.6. In-
voking Proposition 3.7, after adding more marked points, we may assume that the
gradient bound (3.1) holds:
		∇˜un(z)
		 ≤
C
ρ(z,hjn)
∀z ∈˙Sn,
where ρ(∗,hjn) denotes the injectivity radius with respect to the hyperbolic metric
hjn on ˙Sn = Sn\(Mn ∪Zn ∪Zn). Again, by the Deligne–Mumford compactness
result we may assume after passing to a subsequence that the domains converge,
(Sn,jn,Mn,Zn ∪Zn) →(S,j,M,D,Z ∪Z).
Let ε > 0, and let

where ρ is the injectivity radius with respect to the Poincaré metric h on ˙S\

and where {Γj} is a ﬁnite collection of disjoint embedded closed curves and embed-
ded arcs starting and ending at ∂˙S.
By Deﬁnition 1.87 there is a sequence of diffeomorphisms ϕn : S →Sn with

so that we may replace the injectivity radii ρn in the gradient estimate with ρ for
sufﬁciently large n at the expense of choosing a larger constant C.
The results in Sect. 2.2.3 then yield a uniform bound on all derivatives on
Thickε( ˙S) for any ε > 0. The Ascoli–Arzela theorem guarantees the existence of
a subsequence which converges in

In order to obtain such a convergent subsequence we actually have to shift the
R-components of the curves such that the gradient bound implies a C0-bound. If
˙S\
j Γj has several connected components we may have to shift the curves on the
individual components by different constants.
Remark 3.12 In the case where ∂Sn ̸= ∅the set {Γj} is a ﬁnite collection of dis-
joint embedded closed curves and embedded arcs starting and ending at ∂˙S. The
convergence statement in the thick part is not affected by this modiﬁcation.
3.3.4 Convergence in the Thin Part and Level Structure
In this section we will cover curves with and without boundary at the same time
since the case of curves with boundary only requires a few minor additional remarks
which does not complicate the exposition. In the last section we have extracted
a subsequence from {Cn} which converges on compact subsets of 
ε Thickε( ˙S),
and we denote its various connected components by C1,...Cm. We denote the
limit by

For sufﬁciently small ε > 0 the ε-thin part of ˙S consists of neighborhoods of punc-
tures isometric to standard cusps.8 We have to distinguish between two kinds of
punctures of ˙S = m
j=1 Cj. Some of the punctures are actually nodes, they were
generated in the limit process n →∞by shrinking certain closed geodesics (or
geodesic arcs between boundary points in the case of nonempty boundary) to
points, and they come in pairs (see Figs. 3.8, 3.9). The other punctures were al-
ready there before we passed to the limit. The aim of this section is to under-
stand the asymptotic behavior of the curve ˜u near the punctures. If ˜u is bounded
near a puncture then we may extend it smoothly across the puncture by the re-
moval of singularities theorem, Theorem 2.68. Otherwise, ˜u approaches a cylin-
der over a periodic Reeb orbit by Proposition 2.47 or a strip over a characteris-
tic chord by Theorem 2.57. We will ﬁrst consider the situation near a node adja-
cent to two components C−and C+ as in Fig. 3.9. We will denote the asymptotic
8Recall from the deﬁnition of convergence of surfaces that there are diffeomorphisms ϕn : S →Sn
and disjoint embedded loops {Γj} ⊂˙S such that ϕn(Γj) are geodesics in Sn. The lengths of these
geodesics tend to zero as n →∞. It follows from the proof of the collar lemma that the circles Γj
are actually degenerate boundary components for the limit metric h = limn→∞ϕ∗
nhn, and these are
isometric to standard cusps. This also explains why removal of singularities theorem and Proposi-
tion 2.47 can be applied near a node.

if one is a point then so is the other, and we would like to explore how they ‘ﬁt
together’.
We consider now components of Thinε( ˙S,ϕ∗

cusps or to half-cusps. In the latter case we double the surface so that we may
consider cusps only. More precisely, by the collar lemma we may assume that each
such component of Thinε( ˙S,ϕ∗

isometric to the following set:

We introduce the more convenient notation ˜vn := (bn,vn) := un ◦ϕn ◦φn and if
c ∈R we write ˜vn −c for (bn −c,vn). What may happen geometrically is that the
images vn([−σn,σn] × S1) (or vn([−σn,σn] × [0,1])) break up at several periodic
orbits (or characteristic chords), different from γ±. The aim is to capture this in the
resulting holomorphic building. If break-up does not happen then we may declare
˜w to be the limit of the sequence (˜vn).
Since for large n the maps vn(±σn,∗) = (un ◦ϕn ◦φn)(±σn,∗) are arbitrarily
close to the loops γ±(T±t), we can associate to this setup a unique homotopy class
of maps F : [−1,1] × S1 →M with F(±1,t) = γ±(T±t). We set

¯γ+
λ −

¯γ−
λ = T+ −T−,
where we use the notation ¯γ±(t) := γ±(T±t). Since we assumed nondegeneracy,
there is a positive constant ℏsuch that S(γ−,γ+,[F]) ≥ℏwhenever S(γ−,γ+,[F])
is not zero, and ℏis the smallest gap in the action spectrum.10 In the case where γ±
are characteristic chords we use a relative homotopy class F : [−1,1]×[0,1] →M,
F([−1,1] × {0,1}) ⊂L. The following two propositions describe the breaking up
of the thin part. The cases of cylinder and strip are largely identical, so we will focus
on one of them. The ﬁrst deals with the case where the ‘neck’ has no energy.
Proposition 3.13 (No energy in the neck-“bubbles connect”) If S(γ−,γ+,[F]) = 0
then γ−≡γ+, and there is a sequence {bn} ⊂R such that the sequence ˜vn −bn
converges in C∞
loc to either a constant or a trivial cylinder over the Reeb orbit
¯γ±(t) = γ±(T±t).
Proof We have

[−σn,σn]×S1 v∗
ndλ →0,
sup
n
E(vn) < +∞.
Because the asymptotic limits γ± have the same action they are either both points
or both periodic orbits of the Reeb vector ﬁeld. We wish to show that γ+(t) = γ−(t)
and that for any C∞-neighborhood U of ¯γ±, in the case where γ± is a periodic orbit,
or for any neighborhood U of γ± in the case where γ± is a point, there exists an
integer N ≥1 such that
vn(s,t) ∈U
∀−σn ≤s ≤σn.
(3.16)
10Also note that S(γ−,γ+,[F]) ≥0 if the homotopy class [F] has a pseudoholomorphic represen-
tative.

3.3
The Compactness Result for the Case Without Boundary
233
Theorems 2.81 and 2.85 describe the behavior of long holomorphic cylinders and
strips with small dλ-energy. Then for every δ > 0 there exist constants n0,h > 0
such that for all n ≥n0 one of the following two possibilities holds:
(a) ˜vn([−σn + h,σn −h] × S1) ⊂Bδ(˜vn(0,0))
(b) vn(s,∗) ∈Uδ(xT ) ∀s ∈[−σn + h,σn −h] for a suitable T -periodic orbit x =
x(σ) of the Reeb vector ﬁeld, where Uδ(xT ) is the δ-ball around xT : t →x(T t)
in C∞(S1,M).
If γ± are both periodic orbits then (b) above and (3.14) imply the assertion (3.16)
and that γ−(t) = γ+(t). Moreover, every subsequence of (vn)n∈N has a subsequence
which converges in C∞
loc(R × S1) to γ−≡γ+, and therefore the whole sequence
converges. The case of characteristic chords is treated similarly.
In the case where γ± are points we proceed as follows: The sequence ˜vn(0,0) −
bn(0,0) has a subsequence which converges to some point (0,p) ∈{0} × M. Then,
by statement (a) above and by (3.14) the two points γ± must be equal to p and the
assertion follows.
□
We now consider the case where the actions of γ−and γ+ are different.
Proposition 3.14 If S(γ−,γ+,[F]) ≥ℏthen, after passing to a suitable subse-
quence, we can ﬁnd ﬁnitely many points, characteristic chords or periodic orbits

procedure has to stop after ﬁnitely many steps, and we get the assertion of the propo-
sition.
□
Adding the marked point (ϕnk ◦φnk)−1(sn,0) at each iteration step we create an
additional spherical component for the limiting Riemann surface which removes a
positive amount of energy no smaller than ℏfrom S(γ−,γ+,[F]).
If the ε-thin part consists of a cusp near a puncture, the analysis is similar as
before. We have to distinguish the cases where the quantity S(γ−,γ+,[F]) is zero
or greater than ℏ.
Having analyzed the behavior of the sequence in the thin part we introduce an
ordering of the components Ci of S\Γj in the following way: We say Ci ≤Cj if
limsup

an

−an

ϕn(xj)

< +∞.
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the points xi and xj. In the case
where the symplectic manifold under consideration is R×M we proceed as follows:
We deﬁne the components Ci which are minimal with respect to the above ordering
as level-one components. After removing those, we declare the minimal remaining
ones to be of level two and so on. If W is a manifold with cylindrical ends we declare
the components whose remains in the compact part to be of level zero. We then use
the above ordering to deﬁne levels ±1,±2,±3,... . If the levels of two components
adjacent to a node differ by more than one then we introduce trivial cylinders to ﬁll
up the levels in between. The situation is the same for holomorphic buildings with
boundary.

Let S = (S,j,M,D,M∂,D∂) be a noded Riemann surface with nonempty bound-
ary (as in Fig. 1.51 on page 96). Here, M∂⊂∂S is a ﬁnite set (marked points on
the boundary), and we assume that D∂⊂∂S is another set of nodal pairs. Given an
ordering of the boundary components of ∂S the orientation of the boundary then
induces a natural ordering of the set M∂once a ‘ﬁrst’ point is chosen. Recall that
we used to compactify a surface with interior marked points by adding circles. As
for boundary marked points, an arc is added (see Fig. 1.47), and we denote the
compactiﬁed surface by SD.

The SFT Compactness Results
be a noded Riemann surface with possibly nonempty boundary. The set of marked
points consists of the sets Z,Z∂, called interior punctures and boundary punctures,
and the sets M,M∂which we will call marked points. When we discussed con-
vergence of Riemann surfaces with boundary we saw that a boundary component
may degenerate by shrinking to a point. It is then indistinguishable from an interior
puncture, and we may either remember the ‘past history’ of this puncture or not. In
the latter case we would just include it in the set of interior punctures Z, otherwise
we would have to distinguish between ‘degenerate’ boundary components Z′ and
interior punctures Z′′. One way of bookkeeping may be better than the other from
the algebraic point of view if it comes to constructing Symplectic Field Theory for
curves with boundary, but this is not the subject of these lectures. The sets

and
D∂=

{δ1,δ1},...,{δl,δl}

⊂∂S
are called the sets of interior and boundary nodal pairs. Each pair {dj,dj} may
belong to the same or to different components of S, and the same is true for
pairs {δj,δj}. The set D is usually considered unordered, but the set D∂car-
ries a natural ordering induced by the orientation of ∂S, once the components of
∂S are ordered. We consider the set of marked points and punctures to be or-
dered. We denote the components of ∂S\Z∂by ∂1S,...,∂mS, and we assume that
L1,...,Lm ⊂R × V are totally real submanifolds where R × V is the symplec-
tization of a closed manifold V endowed with some contact form λ, and where J
is a dλ compatible complex structure on ξ = kerλ. We will cast the deﬁnition of
a holomorphic building in a rather general framework, but we will only prove the
compactness result in the case where the boundary condition is R×L where L ⊂M
is a Legendrian submanifold.

is called a holomorphic building of height 1 if it has ﬁnite energy, if it satisﬁes the
boundary conditions ˜u(∂jS) ⊂Lj, and if for all pairs of special marked points
˜u(dj) = ˜u(dj)
and
˜u(δj) = ˜u(δj).
Such a curve is called stable if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
• At least one component of the curve is not a trivial cylinder or a trivial strip.
• If S′ is a connected component of S with ∂S′ = ∅on which ˜u is constant,
then the Riemann surface S′ with all its marked points, punctures and special
marked points is stable in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.17. If S′ is such a compo-
nent with nonempty boundary then we demand that its double S′#S′ is stable as
above.
Assume that p is a puncture. If p ∈Z∂let ∂jS,∂j+1S be the components of
∂S\Z∂adjacent to p. We consider the asymptotic behavior of ˜u near p in the fol-
lowing cases:
(1) p ∈Z is an interior puncture: Under some nondegeneracy assumptions on the
set of periodic orbits of the Reeb vector ﬁeld, the asymptotic behavior of ˜u is
given by Proposition 2.47. We may then associate a particular periodic orbit of
the Reeb vector ﬁeld to each interior puncture.
(2) If p ∈Z∂and if
L0 = R × L0,
L1 = R × L1,
where L0,L1 ⊂V are Legendrian submanifolds (i.e. λ|T Li ≡0) then ˜u ap-
proaches a trivial strip, see Theorem 2.57. Again, under suitable nondegeneracy
assumptions, we may assume to each boundary puncture a characteristic chord,
i.e. a trajectory connecting two given Legendrian submanifolds of V .
(3) If p is a boundary puncture, V is three-dimensional, and if one boundary con-
dition adjacent to p is R × L where L ⊂V is a Legendrian link while the other
is of the form {0} × F where F is a Seifert surface for L then the asymptotics
of ˜u is described by Theorem 2.58. In this case we may associate to each such
puncture a point on the knot L.
As in [12] we will call two such curves (˜u = (a,u),j,S) and (˜u′ = (a′,u′),j′,S′)
equivalent if there is a diffeomorphism φ : S →S′ such that
• (φ∗)−1 ◦j′ ◦φ∗= j
• φ sends the sets M,Z,D,M∂,Z∂,D∂onto the sets M′,Z′,D′,M′
∂,Z′
∂,D′
∂pre-
serving the ordering (if applicable) and mapping nodal pairs to nodal pairs.
• u′ ◦φ = u
• a′ ◦φ −a is locally constant
The last condition means that we identify curves which differ by translation in the
R-direction. Then the boundary condition of course has to be R-invariant as well
(otherwise we ask for ˜u′ ◦φ = ˜u). In cases (1) and (2) above the R-component at
each puncture either tends to +∞or to −∞(see Theorem 2.74) while in case (3)

238

the R-component tends to zero at the puncture. In cases (1) and (2) we will use the
notation Z± and Z±
∂to distinguish between positive and negative punctures.

k=1 M∂,k are
equipped with some ordering respecting the orderings of the individual sets Mk

i.e. the building on level k + 1 has as many interior or boundary negative punctures

orientation reversing diffeomorphisms
Φk : Γ +
k →Γ −

and
Φ∂,k : Γ +

taching maps, i.e.

and

3.4.3 Holomorphic Buildings in Manifolds with Cylindrical Ends
In this section we will introduce the notion of holomorphic buildings in manifolds
with cylindrical ends. More precisely, we will consider symplectic manifolds of the
following types:
(A) W is a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary V = V + ∪V −, and
cylindrical ends E± = R± × V ± are attached to the contact type boundary as
explained on page 111. We may consider a relative version of this as follows:
Let L± ⊂V ± be Legendrian submanifolds, and let L ⊂W be a Lagrangian
submanifold such that
L ∩V =

R × L+
∪

R × L−
.
(B) W is obtained from another symplectic manifold W ′ by cutting W ′ open along
a contact type hypersurface V and then attaching a positive and a negative end
to the newly created boundary (‘splitting construction’, see page 111). As for
the relative version we consider a Lagrangian submanifold L ⊂W such that
V ∩L = L is a Legendrian submanifold of V .
In the ﬁrst case we deﬁne a holomorphic building of height k−|1|k+ where k± are
non-negative integers. It consists of the following ingredients:
11Recall that by deﬁnition each (˜um,jm,Sm) is itself a sequence (˜un

(2) A holomorphic building of height k+ in the cylindrical manifold R × V+
and another of height k−in the cylindrical manifold R × V−which we de-
note by (˜uk,jk,Sk) with 1 ≤k ≤k+ or −k−≤k ≤−1 and with decoration
maps {Φk,Φ∂,k}, 1 ≤k ≤k+ −1 or −k−≤k ≤−2 gluing the positive punc-
tures in Zk ∪Z∂,k to the negative punctures in Zk+1 ∪Z∂,k+1, and where
Sk = (Sk,Mk ∪Zk,Dk,M∂,k ∪Z∂,k,D∂,k) keeps track of all the marked points,
punctures and nodes in the interior and on the boundary.
(3) An ordering of the total set of marked points 
−k−≤j≤k+ Mj compatible
with the ordering on each Mj (the set of marked points on each individ-
ual level 1 curve), but not necessarily preserving the numbering of the sets
M−k−,...,Mk+. The same for the set of marked points 
−k−≤j≤k+ M∂,j on
the boundary.
We also need to assume the following:
• The numbers p+
0 ,p+
∂,0 of positive punctures of v equals the numbers of negative
punctures p−
1 ,p−
∂,1 of ˜u1.
• The numbers p−
0 ,p−
∂,0 of negative punctures of v equals the numbers of positive
punctures p+
−1,p+
∂,−1 of ˜u−1.
• For
k = −1,0
there
are
also
(orientation
reversing)
diffeomorphisms
Φk,Φ∂,k : Γ +
k →Γ −
k+1, where Γ ±
k
are the circles (or arcs, respectively) added
for each interior puncture (or boundary puncture, respectively).
Denote by S0 the oriented blow-up of S0 at the punctures Z0 ∪Z∂,0, and let
S+ = S1 ∪Φ1,Φ∂,1 ···Sk+−1 ∪Φk+−1,Φ∂,k+−1 Sk+
S−= Sk−∪Φk−,Φ∂,k−···S−2 ∪Φ−2,Φ∂,−2 S−1
be the surfaces obtained from gluing together the various levels of the holomorphic
buildings at their punctures. Gluing S−with S0 using Φ−1,Φ∂,−1, and gluing S+
with S0 using Φ0,Φ∂,0 we obtain a piecewise smooth surface S = S−∪S0 ∪S+.
We ﬁnally demand that for sufﬁciently small ε > 0 the maps
u−: S−→V −,
u+ : S+ →V +
induced by u1,...,uk+ and uk−,...,u−1, respectively and the map Gε ◦v :
S0 →

tinuous map S →W. Figure 3.12 illustrates a holomorphic building in a mani-

fold with cylindrical ends. The signature of such a building consists of the data
(g,μ,μ∂,p−,p−
∂,p+,p+
∂) where μ = #M, μ∂= #M∂are the numbers of all
marked points, p+
∂= p+
∂,k+, p+ = p+
k+ and p−
∂= p−
∂,k−, p−= p−
k−are the total
number of punctures at the highest and the lowest level (interior and boundary punc-
tures recorded separately).
Given a holomorphic building (˜u−,v, ˜u+) of height k−|1|k+, we will sometimes
say that it consists of three layers with the one in the middle being the main layer.
The equivalence of two such buildings is deﬁned similarly to the equivalence of
buildings of height N except that there is no R-translation in the main layer to factor
out. The deﬁnition of convergence is also evident. We say a holomorphic building
of height k−|1|k+ is stable if all three layers are. In the case of the main layer

this means the following: For every component C of the Riemann surface we want
F0|C either to be not constant or otherwise we want C with all its punctures and
marked points D0,D∂,0,M0,M∂,0,Z0,Z∂,0 to be stable, i.e. #Aut(C) < ∞. We
denote the moduli space of holomorphic buildings of height k−|1|k+ and signature
(g,μ,μ∂,p−,p−
∂,p+,p+
∂) by
k−,k+M(g,μ,μ∂,p−,p−
∂,p+,p+
∂)(W,L,J).
We use the notation k−,k+M(g,μ,μ∂)(W,L,J) for the union of the above spaces
over all p−,p−
∂,p+,p+
∂≥0. We write M(g,μ,μ∂)(W,L,J) for the union over all
k± ≥0.
The case of the splitting construction is not much different from the case of a
manifold with cylindrical ends. The appropriate notion is the one of a holomorphic
building of height :k0
1 which consists of a holomorphic building of height 1 in the
main layer and a holomorphic building of height k0 in the cut-open region. We re-
frain from bothering the reader with another heap of notation, and refer to Fig. 3.13
instead. The relevant notation is contained in the paper [12] for the case of surfaces
without boundary.
3.4.4 A More General Compactness Result
We will now consider a sequence of pseudoholomorphic curves in a symplectic
manifold (W,ω) with almost complex structure J , so that W is one of the following:
• W is cylindrical, i.e. W = R × M where M is a closed contact manifold and
J = ˜J is the usual R-invariant almost complex structure.
• W = E−∪W ∪E+ is a symplectic manifold with cylindrical ends as explained
in Sect. 2.1 of Chap. 2.13
• W is a symplectic manifold created by splitting along a contact type hypersur-
face.
We always assume that the almost complex structure on W is compatible with the
symplectic structure, and that it equals the R-invariant almost complex structure ˜J
(with dλ-compatible J : kerλ →kerλ) in the cylindrical ends. We also assume
throughout that the contact forms in the ends are non-degenerate. In the paper [12]
the authors introduce the notion of an ‘adjusted almost complex structure’. Our
requirements are a special case of this. The boundary condition considered here is
a Lagrangian submanifold L ⊂W with L = R × L in the cylindrical ends where
L ⊂V is a Legendrian submanifold.
The more general compactness result below does not need a new proof. We in-
serted remarks into the proofs of the previous results in order to indicate the neces-
sary additions and modiﬁcations.
13Note that the ends may be disconnected.

Theorem 3.20 (SFT compactness theorem)
Consider a sequence of pseudoholo-
morphic curves
Cn = (˜un,Sn,jn,Mn,Zn ∪Zn),
where (Sn,jn) is a compact stable Riemann surface, possibly with boundary, with
marked points Mn = Mint
n ∪M∂
n in the interior and on the boundary, punctures
Zn ∪Zn = Zint
n ∪Z∂
n ∪Zint
n ∪Z∂
n (note that jn extends over all of them) and all
surfaces have the same signature. The maps
˜un : Sn\(Zn ∪Zn) −→W
are pseudoholomorphic curves with energy bounded by some constant E0 > 0 and
boundary condition in L ⊂W as described above, and the punctures
Zint
n =

z(n)

are all negative while the punctures

z(n)
1 ,...,z(n)
p+

,
Z∂

ζ (n)

are all positive. We also assume that all the curves ˜un are asymptotic at the corre-
sponding punctures to the same periodic orbits/characteristic chords (i.e. to each
interior puncture we associate a certain periodic orbit and to each boundary punc-
ture a certain characteristic chord).14 Then there exists a subsequence of {Cn} which
converges to
• a stable holomorphic building of height k ≥1 in the cylindrical case,
• a stable holomorphic building of height k−|1|k+ in the case with cylindrical ends,
• a stable holomorphic building of height :k0
1 in the splitting case.
14This is not a real assumption since it can be achieved by merely passing to a suitable subse-
quence due to the uniform bound on the energy and the nondegeneracy of the contact form. In
the paper [12] the authors also consider the Morse–Bott case for curves without boundary. Then
one has to assume that all the curves ˜un are asymptotic at the corresponding punctures to periodic
orbits lying in the same connected component in the space of periodic orbits.
