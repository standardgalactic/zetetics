Abstract
Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been impressive.
However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior,
such as hallucinating facts, generating ﬂawed code, or creating offensive and toxic
content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check
and reﬁne their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code
interpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework
called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially “black boxes” to validate
and progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction
with tools. More speciﬁcally, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with
appropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output
based on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive
evaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program syn-
thesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the
performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance
of external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs.1

Introduction
The remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has been amply
demonstrated across an array of language tasks [1–4]. Their potential to augment human intellect
continues to burgeon [5–7]. However, these models are not without their shortcomings. They
occasionally exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as hallucination (generating inaccurate or non-
truthful responses), faulty code, or even toxic content [8–15]. Such inconsistent behavior hampers
the trust in these models and poses hurdles to their real-world applications [16].
Traditional approaches to mitigate these limitations typically employ supervised training, involving
behavior cloning, reinforcement learning, and self-training [6, 17–29]. However, these methods are
constrained by the requirement of large-scale human annotation or data construction, which is often
resource-intensive and challenging to obtain. To address these challenges, we present Self-Correcting
with Tool-Interactive Critiquing (CRITIC), a novel framework that empowers black-box LLMs to
verify and progressively rectify their own output through human-like interaction with external tools.
Drawing inspiration from human cognition [30, 31] and critical thinking [32–34], CRITIC offers a
versatile framework that supports precise, interpretable veriﬁcation and correction of generated text.

Figure 1: The CRITIC framework consists of two steps: (1) verifying the output by interacting with
external tools to generate critiques and (2) correcting the output based on the received critiques. We
can iterative such verify-then-correct process to enable continuous improvements.
As depicted in Figure 1, CRITIC interacts with external tools like search engines and code interpreters
to verify the desired aspects of an initial output and subsequently amends the output based on
the critiques from the veriﬁcation. This verify-then-correct process can be repeated to ensure
constant output enhancement. Contrary to methods that rely on expensive annotations or task-speciﬁc
training, CRITIC utilizes in-context learning with tool interaction to proﬁciently identify and rectify
unsatisfactory behaviors using the LLM itself. This unique approach makes CRITIC both practical
and accessible, requiring only access to text-to-text tool APIs and a few-shot demonstration.
We conduct experiments with GPT-3.5 LLMs across three diverse tasks: free-form question answering,
mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction. The results afﬁrm that CRITIC consistently
outperforms previous methods without necessitating additional corpora or training. For instance,
when applied to ChatGPT, CRITIC achieves 7.7 F1 improvements across three QA tasks, 5.7%
absolute gains on GSM8k, and a 79.2% reduction in toxicity probability. Interestingly, our ﬁndings
highlight the unreliability of LLMs, speciﬁcally ChatGPT and Text-Davinci-003, when it comes
to validating their own results. We discover that relying solely on self-correction without external
feedback may result in marginal improvements or even degraded performance.
Our primary contributions include: (1) Proposing the CRITIC framework, enabling frozen LLMs to
verify and iteratively self-correct their output through interaction with external tools. (2) Conducting
comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks that demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improve-
ments offered by CRITIC across different base LLMs. (3) Highlighting the inadequacy of LLMs in
self-veriﬁcation and self-correction, and emphasizing that feedback from external tool interaction is
crucial for consistent self-improvement of LLMs.

Truthfulness Evaluation
Untruthfulness [35] is a critical issue for LLMs because it may halluci-
nate incorrect output that is hard to distinguish [10, 36, 16], especially when relying on parametric
memory [37]. A great deal of previous works design methods to detect hallucinated output [35, 38, 39]
of language models for different downstream tasks [40, 41], including abstractive summarization
[8, 42–44], dialogue generation [9], and table-to-text generation [45–47]. Notably, these works
mainly study task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuned models with a focus on faithfulness, i.e., factual consistent with
the provided source content [48, 45, 38]. The truthfulness evaluation for open-ended text generation
is less studied, especially for LLMs which may only be accessed via APIs. We ﬁll this gap by letting
the black-box LLMs interact with external tools to verify their own output. Our method is also
inspired by fact-checking in journalism [49] that assesses whether a claim made by a human is true
[50–54]. We further provide a comprehensive review of related work on uncertainty estimation in
Appendix A.

Natural Language Feedback
The technique of using natural language (NL) feedback is widely
adopted to improve various tasks [55–58, 24]. There are two main forms of feedback: scalar signals
[59] are commonly used for reinforcement learning [60–64] and generate-then-rank framework
[14, 65–68], while natural language feedback [6] is commonly used for text editing using prompted
LLMs [69–72] or trained correctors [25–28]. Sources of feedback include human demonstration
[6, 17] and evaluation [18–24], existing corpora such as wiki edits [26], automatically constructed
data [27–29], external metrics [63, 27] or knowledge [69, 73], and even the LLM itself [6, 67, 74, 70–
72]. Nevertheless, LLM’s self-feedback has limited and task-speciﬁc performance compared to
human feedback [6] and LLMs struggle with veriﬁcation on truthfulness [75–77] and reasoning
correctness [78–80]. To address such issues, we focus on fully exploiting the emergent ability of
LLMs for evaluation [81–83] by empowering them with accessible external tools. We compare the
most relevant recent studies to our work in Table 5 in the Appendix.
Tools Augmented Language Models
Beyond relying entirely on memorization [84], interacting
with tools enhances the ﬁdelity and potency of LLMs [85, 86], enabling them to fully leverage their in-
herent reasoning and compositionality capabilities [87]. Studies show that we can augment generation
with retrievers [88–92] or search engines [93–95], enhance math reasoning with a calculator [96, 65],
leverage a interpreter to execute the generated code [97, 98], use mathematical prover to prove math-
ematical theory [99], or use multiple tools automatically [100, 101]. We can teach the LLMs to use
tools by pre-training [102], ﬁne-tuning [93, 103], or in-context learning [97, 101]. CRITIC avoids
task-speciﬁc training and employs in-context learning, which is more simple and general.

CRITIC: Correcting with Tool-Interactive Critiquing
We can get an overview of the CRITIC method through Figure 1. Given any input, LLMs ﬁrst
generate an initial output based on parametric knowledge, then interact with appropriate external
tools (possibly multi-round) through text-to-text APIs to verify the output. The critiques generated by
the veriﬁcation step not only reﬂect the correctness of the model output, but also serve as feedback
to allow LLMs to correct the output. We can iterate the cycle of “Verify ⇒Correct ⇒Verify” to
continuously improve the output until a speciﬁc stopping condition is met. See Algorithm 1 for a
summary of CRITIC method, and the following sections for details.
3.1
In-context Learning for LLMs
CRITIC utilizes the emergent abilities of chain-of-thought reasoning [104] and few-shot in-context
learning [1, 105] of LLMs. Few-shot in-context learning is a powerful approach that exploits the
capabilities of LLMs to solve a task given a small set of input-output examples at test time [106].
The few-shot setting typically involves only a handful of examples (k). To accomplish this task,
the examples {(xi, yi)}k
i=1 are combined into a prompt p, which concatenates the input and output
pairs as follows: ⟨x1 · y1⟩⟨x2 · y2⟩. . . ⟨xk · yk⟩. During inference, a test instance xtest is added to the
prompt, and the model is then tasked with completing the sequence to generate an output ytest.

Previous toxic text: & last year before hanging himself.
The text has 53% toxicity of threat. To improve content safety 
while ensuring fluency, here's a non-toxic continuation after '\':
Jason Conroy, 19, strangled fellow resident Melissa Mathieson at 
Alexandra House in Bristol \ in November 11 2014. It serves as a 
reminder of the importance of mental health support to&
Question: Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan 
pizzas cut into 4 pieces. If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas 
and Ann and Cate eat 75%, how many pizza pieces are left?
Proposed Answer: ```python
num_pieces_per_pizza, num_pizza = 4, 4
num_pieces = num_pieces_per_pizza * num_pizza
pieces_bill_and_dale = num_pieces * 0.5
pieces_ann_and_cate = num_pieces * 0.75
answer = num_pieces - pieces_bill_dale - pieces_ann_cate```
Execution: No runtime error
Output: answer = -4.0
What's the problem with the above code?
1. Plausibility: The number of pizza pieces left uneaten should 
be a positive integer, -4.0 < 0, so the answer is not reasonable. 
2. Correctness: Let's check the code:
> # each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces.
> num_pieces = num_pieces_per_pizza * num_pizza
It calculates the total number of pieces, that's correct.
> pieces_bill_dale = num_pieces * 0.5
> pieces_ann_cate = num_pieces * 0.75
Each person only eats their own personal pan pizza, 
`num_pieces * 0.5` means 50% of the total pieces, this is wrong.
Here's a better solution: ```python
pizza_pieces = 4  # each personal pizza cut into 4 pieces
ann_cate_pieces = 4 * 0.75 * 2 # Ann, Cate eats 75%
bill_dale_pieces = 4 * 0.5 * 2 # Bill, Dale eats 50%
total_eaten = ann_cate_pieces + bill_dale_pieces 
answer = pizza_pieces * 4  - total_eaten # pieces left```
Question: Who won the 2016 Russian national silver medal with 
another Russian ice dancer born 29 April 1995?
Proposed Answer: The 2016 Russian national silver medal was 
won by Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin. Alexandra 
Stepanova was born 29 April 1995. Ivan Bukin was born 10 April 
1993. So the answer is: Ivan Bukin.
What's the problem with the above answer?
1. Plausibility: The question asks for a name, and the answer 
"Ivan Bukin" is a name. So it's plausible.
2. Truthfulness: Let's search the proposed answer in google:
> Search Query: The 2016 Russian national silver medal was 
won by Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin.
> Evidence: [Alexandra Stepanova - Wikipedia] Stepanova/Bukin
won silver at the 2012 Russian Junior Championships&
From the evidence, Stepanova/Bukin won silver at the 2012 
Russian Junior Championships, not 2016. 
Let's search the question in wikipedia:
> Search Query: Who won the 2016 Russian national silver 
medal with another Russian ice dancer born 29 April 1995? site: 
wikipedia.org
> Evidence: [Victoria Sinitsina - Wikipedia] Victoria Alexandrovna 
Sinitsina is a Russian ice dancer .
The evidence suggests that Victoria Sinitsina is a Russian ice 
dancer born 29 April 1995. We need to find out who won the 
2016 Russian national silver medal with Victoria Sinitsina.
> Search Query: Who won the 2016 Russian national silver 
medal with Victoria Sinitsina?
> Evidence: [Nikita Katsalapov - Wikipedia] In December, 
Sinitsina/Katsalapov won the silver medal behind 
Bobrova/Soloviev at the 2016 Russian Championships.
The evidence suggests that Nikita Katsalapov won the 2016 
Russian national silver medal with Victoria Sinitsina, not 
Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin. The answer is incorrect.
Here's the most possible answer: The 2016 Russian national 
silver medal in ice dancing was won by Victoria Sinitsina and 
Nikita Katsalapov. Victoria Sinitsina was born on April 29, 1995. 
So the answer is: Nikita Katsalapov.

Figure 2: CRITIC prompts on example tasks, simpliﬁed for presentation, see full prompts in
Appendix D. CRITIC initially veriﬁes the desired aspects (e.g., “plausibility” and “truthfulness”) of
the proposed answer by interacting with appropriate tools (e.g., search engine, code interpreter),
and subsequently generate a corrected answer based on the critiques from veriﬁcation.
3.2
Interaction with External Tools
To enable LLMs to use tools, we ﬁrst construct various external tools such as search engines, code
interpreters, and various APIs into text-to-text functions, then interleave the LLMs generations with
tool use in in-context demonstrations. As shown in Figure 2, the input for a search engine can be
a query generated by LLMs, which returns a parsed search result, whereas the input for a code
interpreter is a program, which returns execution information and the ﬁnal execution result. This free
format allows LLMs to mimic human thinking and behavior, facilitating the construction of prompts
intuitively and concisely while having strong interpretability and trustworthiness [87].
3.3
Veriﬁcation with Tool-Interaction
Given input x and previous output yi, LLMs interact with external tools to criticize the yi and
produce critiques ci. The task-speciﬁc critiques can be used to detail the attributes of the output we
expect to evaluate, such as truthfulness, feasibility, or safety. See §4.4 for detailed experiments using
CRITIC for hallucination detection. For different inputs, we can use task-dependent, heuristically
selected, or automatically selected appropriate tools for veriﬁcation. We can implement automatic
tool selection with in-context learning, allowing different tools for different input-output pairs. In our
implementation, we pre-specify tools for different tasks to facilitate evaluation and experimentation.
4

For example, as shown in Figure 2, the tool used for the QA task is Google, enabling LLMs to verify
the truthfulness of output by analyzing and interacting with Google in an interleaved manner.
3.4
Correction with Critiques
LLMs can generate an improved answer conditioned on input x, previous output yi, and critiques ci
from veriﬁcation. Critiques play a crucial role in the correction process as they identify errors, offer
actionable suggestions, or provide credible groundings through interaction with external tools, thus
guiding a new generation to avoid similar mistakes. Motivated by the human process of iterative
drafts reﬁnement, we can iterate the process of verify-then-correct until speciﬁc stopping criteria are
met, such as satisfying critiques from veriﬁcation, reaching the maximum iterations n, or receiving
environmental feedback. This method facilitates continuous output improvement by systematically
and sample-efﬁciently verifying and correcting errors resulting from interactions with the world.
4
Experiments
We evaluate CRITIC on diverse tasks: free-form question answering focuses on truthfulness related
to open-ended general factual knowledge [107–109] and multi-hop reasoning [110]; mathematical
program synthesis focuses on the correctness and executability of the LLMs generated program for
mathematical reasoning; toxicity reduction regards the safety of model generation in open-ended
output space. We implement our methods with two settings: CRITIC applying corrections on all
samples, while CRITIC∗adopts an oracle setting that only corrects the incorrect samples. The
following presents detailed implementation, baselines, and corresponding results for each task.
LLMs
We report experimental results with text-davinci-003 version of InstructGPT trained
with RLHF [2], as well as gpt-3.5-turbo version of ChatGPT, the most advanced GPT3.5 model
aligned for chat applications.2 We use the same prompts for different LLMs.
4.1
Free-form Question Answering
We ﬁrst consider free-form question answering that has rich applications in real life [107–110] and
well-known concern towards truthfulness [35].
Implementation
To improve generality, we avoid relying on task-speciﬁc retrievers [111–113]
that may lead to higher performance and overﬁtting. Instead, we employ the Google Search API3
to search queries generated by LLMs, scrape the resulting top-1 HTML web page, and extract a
maximum of 400 characters by fuzzy-matching the snippet from Google. The Maximum number of
interactions with Google is set to 7. We use chain-of-thought prompting [104] to produce an initial
answer and then correct up to n = 3 rounds, stopping early if the answer remains the same for two
consecutive corrections. We consider the plausibility and truthfulness during veriﬁcation, as shown
in the prompts provided in Appendix D. We use greedy decoding for all results.
Datasets and Metrics
We experiment with three datasets: AmbigNQ [108], an enhanced version
of Natural Question [107] that employs multi-reference annotations to resolve ambiguity, along with
TriviaQA [109] and HotpotQA [110]. We randomly sampled 500 examples from the validation set of
each dataset and reported the results in terms of EM and F1 scores.
Baselines
Vanilla few-shot prompting [1] provides a direct answer. Chain-of-thought prompting
(CoT) [104] generates step-by-step rationales before the ﬁnal answer. ReAct [87] intertwines
reasoning and interacting with Wikipedia. We found their original setup and actions generalized
poorly across models and data, so we reproduced their results using our search API, which resulted in
better performance, see prompts in Appendix D. CRITIC w/o Tool removes the search API and uses
the LLMs to generate evidence without changing the prompt of CRITIC. We additionally include
state-of-the-art supervised methods for each dataset [114, 92, 115].
2All API call results reported were obtained between January and April 2023. While preliminary experiments
were conducted using earlier versions of ChatGPT, we ultimately re-ran and reported all experiments on the
newly released gpt-3.5-turbo for reproducibility.

Results
As seen in Table 1, 1) CRITIC dramatically improves over the model’s initial CoT results
across all datasets, settings, and LLMs, requiring only three corrections. 2) CRITIC works better
with more powerful LLMs. CRITIC and CRITIC∗improve F1 for 5.6 and 10.3 respectively upon
text-davinci-003, and 7.7 and 12.4 upon ChatGPT. 3) By combining parameter knowledge
with external feedback, CRITIC is signiﬁcantly superior to ReAct, which relies on search to obtain
information, with average F1 improvements of 5.1 and 8.2 on two LLMs, respectively. 4) Tool-
interaction plays a critical role in CRITIC, as the model’s own critiques contribute marginally to
the improvement (-0.03 and +2.33 F1 with the two LLMs), and even fall short compared to the
initial output. 5) We qualitatively demonstrate that CRITIC is capable of correcting untruthful facts,
rectifying faulty reasoning traces, and detecting outdated knowledge in LLMs (See Appendix C).
4.2
Mathematical Program Synthesis
We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in mathematical program synthesis
[58, 65]. This task involves generating a program y that, when executed, accurately solves a natural
language problem description x, requiring a complex integration of language comprehension, problem
decomposition, and multi-step mathematical problem-solving strategies.
Implementation
As shown in Figure 2, we utilize the Python interpreter as a tool to get two types
of feedback: error messages and execution results. We use the original error messages from the inter-
preter, such as “NameError("num_pizza is not defined")” or “Time out”, and represent
them in natural language form as “Execution: {error message}”. For execution results, we
use the value of the variable “answer” after the execution is completed. We use program-of-thought
(PoT) [98] to generate the initial program and then apply a maximum of n = 4 corrections, stopping
if the executed result remains unchanged for two consecutive revisions. We use greedy decoding
for initial results following previous works [98, 27], and sampling with p = 0.5 for correction.
Datasets and Metrics
We adopt the arithmetic reasoning dataset GSM8k [65] and utilize the
ofﬁcial test split, which consists of 1319 problems. Following established metrics [65, 98], we round
the predicted numbers for comparison with the ground truth and report the exact match score.

Figure 4: Iterations on GSM8k.
Baselines
Vanilla few-shot prompting [1] provides a direct answer without programming. Program-
of-thought (PoT) [98] is a SoTA method that writes programs to solve problems. We perform
“CRITIC w/o Tool” ablations by only removing interpreter information. Additionally, we obtained
the results of PAL and Self-Reﬁne on Codex [12] from Madaan et al. [72]: PAL is similar to PoT,
while Self-Reﬁne utilizes only LLM to reﬁne the program and stops when it generates “it is correct”.
Results
As shown in Table 2, 1) CRITIC sizable improves upon the PoT across both LLMs,
using either correction strategy: always correcting (CRITIC), or only correcting incorrect programs
(CRITIC∗). 2) CRITIC performs better when paired with more powerful LLMs. 3) Without execution
feedback from the interpreter, the ability of LLMs to correct programs becomes limited and unstable.
This can result in surprising performance deterioration, such as the 1.8-point decrease observed on
text-davinci-003, and it further exacerbated with Self-Reﬁne on Codex due to the unreliable
feedback from the LLMs regarding program correctness.
4.3
Toxicity Reduction
We investigate the task of reducing toxicity [15, 63], which requires generating ﬂuent and nonoffensive
text continuations given a prompt x. This task is both crucial for safety and challenging due to the
misaligned pretraining objectives of LLMs using internet text [15].
Implementation
We use PERSPECTIVE API4 as a tool to obtain ﬁne-grained toxicity information.
The API provides an overall toxicity score and scores for six ﬁne-grained attributes such as insult,
profanity, and identity attack. We score each output with the API, select the attribute with the highest
score, and represent the critique as “The text has {score} toxicity of {attribute}”,
for example, “The text has 39% toxicity of insult”. We set the maximum iterations n to
4, and terminate the detoxiﬁcation process when the overall toxicity of an output falls below 10%.
We use nucleus sampling with p = 0.9 throughout the experiments, the same as all the baselines [27].
Datasets and Metrics
We randomly sample 1k prompts from the non-toxic prompts of the RE-
ALTOXICITYPROMPTS [15], which was designed to elicit toxic responses. We score toxicity using
PERSPECTIVE API along two dimensions: 1) the maximum toxicity across 25 generations, and 2)
the probability of toxicity exceeding 50% in at least one of those 25 generations, as done in previous
research [15, 63, 27]. We use text-davinci-003 to calculate the perplexity of the continuation
generated by LLMs. We report dist-2 and dist-3 scores for distinct bigrams and trigrams.
Baselines
We compare CRITIC with the base LLMs and previously reported supervised methods
from Welleck et al. [27], including PPLM [116], GeDi [117], DEXPERT [118], PPO, Quark [63] and
Self-Correct [27]. PPO and Quark are strong RL approaches using PERSPECTIVE API as a reward.
Self-Correct [27] constructs toxicity reduction pairs using PERSPECTIVE API and trains a separate
corrector to detoxify the output for multiple rounds. For the CRITIC w/o Tool, we use the LLMs
instead of the API to score ﬁne-grained toxicity of the text (refer to the prompt in Appendix D).

CRITIC w/o Tool
Figure 5: Iterations on detoxiﬁcation.
Notably, we present the results of previous state-of-the-art approaches for toxicity reduction using
GPT-2, as they require extensive training and are difﬁcult to reproduce with LLMs [116–119].
Results
The results in Table 3 demonstrate that 1) CRITIC substantially lowers the occurrence
of toxic generations, while preserving ﬂuency and diversity as the vanilla LLMs; 2) CRITIC shows
toxicity mitigation capabilities on par with supervised SoTA methods, while not requiring extra data
or training; 3) Furthermore, our ﬁndings underscore the vital importance of external feedback in
detoxiﬁcation, as the LLM alone faces challenges in effectively mitigating toxicity.
4.4
Is Self-Veriﬁcation Reliable?
To assess the reliability of self-veriﬁcation using LLMs, as outlined in §3.3, we use LLMs to generate
conﬁdence scores for their own outputs and examine the discriminative capability of these scores. We
evaluate with free-form QA because it’s an important open-ended NLG problem with clear ground
truth, and hallucination detection for open-ended generation is also insufﬁciently studied, especially
for LLMs [35, 40, 41]. See Appendix A for a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty estimation.
Implementation
We experiment with ChatGPT following the setup described in §4.1, using CoT
for answer generation. During veriﬁcation, we generate critiques on the proposed answer and ask the
model if the answer is correct by appending the following prompt:
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct (B) probably correct (C) probably wrong (D)
absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be:
where we expect the LLM to output ‘(A)’, ‘(B)’, ‘(C)’ or ‘(D)’. We use the probabilities of tokens
from LLMs and take their normalized weighted summation as the ﬁnal conﬁdence score. Formally,
for a given set of options S = {A, B, C, D}, where each option has a weight wi and probability pi,
then the conﬁdence score is calculated as (P
i∈S wipi)/P
i∈S wi, where wi is set from 4 to 1.
Datasets and Metrics
We use the same data and split as described in §4.1. The EM scores in Table
1 demonstrate a range of 30 to over 80 across the three datasets, enabling an effective assessment
of the method’s generalization ability across data with varying difﬁculty. We observed that fuzzy
matching is more consistent with human evaluation than exact matching for open-ended answers, and
thus we deem answers with an F1 score exceeding 0.6 as correct. We use the discrimination metric
AUROC as a better measure of uncertainty for free-form generation than calibration metrics ECE or
Brier score [76, 120]. We also report the veriﬁcation accuracy of non-intrinsic methods.

Baselines
We compare our method with intrinsic estimation scores, including LM Porbs (entropy)
[120], length-normalized predictive entropy [121], maximum predictive entropy [77], and sampling-
based method Self-Con [120]. We report Self-Evalution [75] for expressed uncertainty [122], which
asks LLMs to directly express conﬁdence in their answer. Details in Appendix A.3. We also compare
a baseline called Only-True, which lacks discriminative capability and predicts all answers as correct.
Results
Experimental results in Table 4 reveal that LLMs struggle to distinguish the veracity of their
own answers and cannot provide reliable conﬁdence regarding “what they know”. For instance, the
Self-Eval approach achieves only slightly better than random guessing accuracy (54%) in verifying
answers on HotpotQA, and performs even worse than the Only-True baseline on TriviaQA, despite
the fact that Only-True has no discrimination ability. In contrast, our proposed CRITIC signiﬁcantly
improves the model’s ability to discern facts by incorporating tool interaction, outperforming all
previous estimation methods while exhibiting strong generality and interpretability.
4.5
Additional Ablations and Analysis
In addition to showing the critical role of tool use, the impact of different LLMs, and the reliability of
veriﬁcation in CRITIC, here we provide further analysis to explore our proposed methods. We also
present qualitative analysis with success and failure cases of all tasks in Appendix C.
Effect of Iterative Correction
We examine the effect of iterative correction for all tasks using
different LLMs. The results of ChatGPT are depicted in Figures 3, 4, and 5, with more results
provided in Appendix B. Our observations are as follows: 1) Iterative correction generally leads
to continuous improvement, with a notable surge when only modifying erroneous samples (oracle
setting). 2) The marginal beneﬁts of multiple corrections diminish, and typically, 2-3 rounds of
corrections yield most of the beneﬁts. 3) In the absence of reliable feedback, relying solely on the
model itself for iterative improvement results in inferior and relatively inefﬁcient returns.
Comparison with Rejection Sampling
To further investigate the role of critiques in answer gen-
eration, we compare CRITIC∗with rejection sampling [6] for QA tasks using best-of-N [21]. Specif-
ically, we generate n new CoTs from scratch and select the answer with the highest metric scores,
employing nucleus sampling with p = 0.5. Table 1 illustrates that generation conditioned on critiques
remarkably outperforms rejection sampling by 4.5/2.9 and 3.3/2.7 in EM/F1 scores for the two LLMs,
respectively. This highlights the ability of critiques to not only pinpoint errors but also provide
actionable suggestions and credible groundings, guiding the new generation to avoid similar errors.
5
Conclusion
We propose CRITIC, a novel plug-and-play framework that empowers frozen LLMs to self-verify
and self-correct by interacting with the external environment. Leveraging the intuition of critical
thinking with external feedback, CRITIC enables LLMs to validate their knowledge and improve
their answers through introspection without requiring further training. Experiments on diverse tasks
and datasets have consistently shown the effectiveness, generality, and interoperability of CRITIC.
Moreover, we shed light on the unreliability of LLMs in self-veriﬁcation, highlighting the potential of
9

external tool interaction to solve this problem. We hope our ﬁndings will inspire further exploration
into the truthfulness of language models, ultimately leading to more trustworthy AI systems.
6
Limitations & Future Work
Latency
Accessing external tools and engaging in iterative veriﬁcation and correction processes
can introduce additional overhead in terms of inference time. In practice, as shown in Figures 3,
4, and 5, we can effectively utilize CRITIC for a relatively small number of iterations (even just
one), while still reaping signiﬁcant beneﬁts. Furthermore, the proposed CRITIC can be employed
to automatically construct high-quality corpora, which is essential for internalizing such gains for
data-centric AI.
Prompt
Engineering
While
our
experiments
have
demonstrated
the
effectiveness
of
CRITIC across LLMs and settings, our experiments rely on appropriate in-context demonstra-
tions. It is important to note that different prompt constructions may impact the experimental results.
Future work should also explore more efﬁcient tool usage for LLMs without relying on manually
crafted demonstrations, which usually have a re-encoded long context window.
More Tasks and Settings
Although we evaluate CRITIC on a range of important tasks using
different LLMs, the effectiveness of CRITIC on other tasks and LLMs remains uncertain, as the
LLM may not always need or be able to leverage appropriate external feedback for different inputs.
Additionally, our experiments were limited to the textual modality, and it should be noted that explicit
language evaluation may not always be suitable for evaluating all model outputs [123]. To address
these limitations, future work can extend CRITIC to more diverse scenarios, such as supporting
translation or multilingual tasks by incorporating dictionaries, verifying complex mathematical
solutions and proofs using WolframAlpha, providing feedback on model decisions through simulated
virtual environments, and expanding to more modalities.
7
Ethical Considerations
While the primary objective of CRITIC is to enhance the performance and reduce misaligned
behaviors of LLMs, measures must be implemented to detect and mitigate any potential risks
associated with steering LLMs towards generating content with malicious intent. In this section, we
discuss the ethical implications associated with our proposed framework, CRITIC , and provide an
overview of potential measures to mitigate these concerns.
Trustworthiness and Transparency
The main goal of CRITIC is to enhance the reliability of
LLMs through self-veriﬁcation and self-correction. Transparency in the veriﬁcation and correction
process is vital to foster trust in the model’s outputs. Users need to understand how the model reaches
its conclusions and be able to verify the corrections made by the system.
Bias and Fairness
LLMs inherit biases from the data they are trained on, and the external tools
utilized within CRITIC can introduce additional biases. It is essential to carefully evaluate and
mitigate biases in both the model and the tools to ensure fairness. By identifying and addressing
biases, we can strive to create more equitable and unbiased language models.
Privacy and Security
The interaction of CRITIC with external tools through APIs raises concerns
about data privacy and security. Implementing robust security measures, such as data anonymization
and secure communication protocols, is crucial to protect user information and prevent unauthorized
access. Safeguarding user privacy and ensuring the security of sensitive data should be a top priority.

Uncertainty Estimation
A seemingly promising option for truthfulness evaluation is to leverage estimated uncertainty [125,
121] as a proxy, which provides a conﬁdence score to reﬂect the likelihood of the predicted answer
being correct [81]. Early work on probabilistic uncertainty estimation in NLP primarily focuses
on classiﬁcation [126, 127] and text regression [128, 129], and more recent work can be divided
into two main categories: intrinsic estimation, which uses language model probability [120, 130]
and sampling [76, 77], and post-hoc estimation, which generally involves parameter-tuning with
additional data [131, 75]. Some recent studies speciﬁcally aim to train [122, 75] or prompt [75, 132]
models to express their epistemic uncertainty using natural language. However, high certainty does
not mean truthful [133, 134, 75], these methods suffer from poor calibration of LLMs [131, 16],
difﬁculty in evaluating free-form text [76], and poor interpretability. In this work, we address these
issues and improve the reliability of expressed uncertainty [122, 75, 132] by interacting with external
tools like search engines, see §4.4.
A.3
Additional Details for Uncertainty Estimation Baselines
Here we provide details of the baselines in Section 4.4: LM Probs uses conditional language
model probability given input x as conﬁdence, calculated as ConfLM Probs = −log p(y|x) =
−P
i log p(yi|y<i), where y<i denotes previously generated tokens. Norm Entropy [121] lever-
ages geometric mean token probability, where we calculate conﬁdence as the arithmetic mean
negative log-probability, given by ConfNorm Entropy = −1
N
PN
i log p(yi|y<i). Max Entropy [77]
uses minimum log-probability to capture the most uncertain token, calculated as ConfMax Entropy =
−mini log p(yi|y<i). Self-Con [120] utilizes self-consistency [135] to obtain conﬁdence. Specif-
ically, we sample n = 20 times using CoT with temperature p = 0.5 to get a set of different ﬁnal
answers A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, and calculates conﬁdence as the frequency of the greedy answer
agreedy among the set: ConfSelf-Con = 1
n
Pn
i=1 δ(ai, agreedy), where δ(ai, agreedy) is an indicator
function that evaluates to 1 if ai is equal to agreedy, and 0 otherwise. Self-Eval [75] employs LLMs
to assess the validity of their own answers by utilizing a prompt in the format of:
Question: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The
Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?
19

Possible Answer: Let’s think step by step. Matt Groening named the
character Milhouse after his childhood friend, Milhouse Van Houten.
So the answer is: Milhouse Van Houten.
Is the possible answer:
(A) True
(B) False
The possible answer is:
where we take the probability of generating the option ‘(A)’ as the conﬁdence score. We found that
displaying extra sampled answers to the model, as suggested by the authors, actually impairs the
CoT evaluation performance. Therefore, we only provide the model with the greedy answer. We
use 10-shot prompts for each dataset, as the authors mentioned that zero-shot does not work well for
Self-Eval.

Question: Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio,
Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?
Proposed Answer: Let’s think step by step. Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act
with one person and one instrument. Wolf Alice is a band with four
people and multiple instruments. So Wolf Alice has a higher
instrument to person ratio. So the answer is: Wolf Alice.
What’s the problem with the above answer?
1. Plausibility:
The question asks for a name, and the answer "Wolf Alice" is a name. So
it’s plausible.
2. Truthfulness:
Let’s search the question in google:
23

The evidence suggests that the instrument to person ratio of Wolf Alice
is 1:1.
The proposed answer is incorrect since Badly Drawn Boy has a higher
instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice.
Question: Which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio,
Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice?
Here’s the most possible answer: Let’s think step by step. Badly Drawn

What’s the problem with the above answer?
24

1. Plausibility:
The question asks for the name of the chief fire officer of Hertfordshire
fire and rescue service, and the answer is "Darryl Keen", which is a
name. So it’s plausible.
2. Truthfulness:
Let’s search the question in google:

The evidence shows that Darryl Keen was the Chief Fire Officer and
Director of Community Protection of Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue
Service until July 2021, which is consistent with the proposed answer.
However, we need to check whether there is a new chief fire officer after
July 2021.
> Search Query: Hertfordshire fire and rescue service chief fire officer
> Evidence: [Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service - Wikipedia] ...The

Proposed Answer: Let’s think step by step. The Tennessee Volunteers
football team plays as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).
The headquarters of the SEC is in Birmingham, Alabama. So the answer
is: Birmingham.
What’s the problem with the above answer?
1. Plausibility:
The question asks for a city, and the answer "Birmingham" is a city. So
it’s plausible.
2. Truthfulness:
Let’s search the question in google:
> Search Query: The Tennessee Volunteers football team plays as a member

Question: Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-
year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-
old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old
produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth
year, the avocado tree doesn’t produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-
old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many
total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?
‘‘‘python
initial_fruits = 50
num_of_fruits_in_6th_year = 3 * initial_fruits

What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The above code causes the "NameError" because it use the variable ‘
num_of_fruits_in_10th_year‘ before it is defined.
2. The order of the calculation is not
correct, ‘num_of_fruits_in_8th_year‘ should be calculated after ‘
num_of_fruits_in_10th_year‘.
Let’s analysis the problem, we can calculate the number of fruits for
each year based on the description in the question.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
initial_fruits = 50
num_of_fruits_in_6th_year = 3 * initial_fruits

regardless of how many guests attend. While the second charges, $25
per person who attends. However, the first venue does not include
food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.
At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the
price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal
in cost?
‘‘‘python

What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The code causes a "TypeError" because the variable ‘x‘ is not defined.
2. The equation in the code is not
correct. We should set the cost of the two venues to be equal to each
other, and then solve for the number of guests required.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
flat_fee = 200

What’s the problem with the above code?
29

1. The number of guests should be an integer, 6.66667 is not reasonable.
2. Let’s check the code:
> # The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many
guests attend.
> flat_fee = 200
> # While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.
> cost_per_person = 25
> # However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates
will cost $5 for each person who attends.
> cost_of_food_per_person = 5
> num_of_guests = flat_fee / (cost_per_person + cost_of_food_per_person)
This piece of code calculates the number of guests needed to make the two
venues equal in cost, but it’s
wrong. The number of guests should be an integer, we can’t have a
fraction of a person.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
# Define the costs of each venue
flat_fee = 200
cost_per_person = 25
cost_of_food_per_person = 5
# Calculate the number of guests needed to make the two venues equal in
cost

Failure Cases
Listing 8: Failure case for CRITIC on GSM8k: Wrong veriﬁcation, the initial code is actually
wrong.
Question: In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary
dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest
enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students
enrolled in hip-hop dance?
‘‘‘python
num_of_students = 20
percent_of_contemporary_dance = 20
percent_of_jazz_dance = 25
percent_of_hip_hop_dance = 100 - percent_of_contemporary_dance -
percent_of_jazz_dance
answer = percent_of_hip_hop_dance
‘‘‘
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 55.0
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance should be a
positive number between 0 and
100, 55 > 0 and 55 < 100, it’s reasonable.
2. Let’s check the code:
30

> num_of_students = 20
> percent_of_contemporary_dance = 20
> percent_of_jazz_dance = 25
> percent_of_hip_hop_dance = 100 - percent_of_contemporary_dance -
percent_of_jazz_dance
This calculates the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, it’
s correct.
> answer = percent_of_hip_hop_dance
This assigns the answer to the variable ‘answer‘, it’s correct.
Therefore, the code is correct.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
# Define the number of students in the class
num_students = 20
# Calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance
num_contemporary = num_students * 0.20
# Calculate the number of students who did not enroll in contemporary
dance
num_remaining = num_students - num_contemporary
# Calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance
num_jazz = num_remaining * 0.25
# Calculate the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance
num_hiphop = num_students - num_contemporary - num_jazz
# Calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance
percent_hiphop = num_hiphop / num_students * 100
answer = percent_hiphop
‘‘‘
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 60.0
Gold Answer: 60.0
Is correct: True
Listing 9: Failure case for CRITIC on GSM8k: Wrong correction.
Question: Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with
his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15
minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?
‘‘‘python
num_of_snowballs = 60
snowballs_per_hour = 20
melt_rate = 2 / 15
answer = 0
while num_of_snowballs > 0:
num_of_snowballs += snowballs_per_hour
num_of_snowballs -= melt_rate * snowballs_per_hour
answer += 1
‘‘‘
Execution: TimeoutError: execution timeout
Output: answer = None
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The code causes the "TimeoutError" because it runs in an infinite loop.
31

2. Let’s check the code:
> num_of_snowballs = 60
> snowballs_per_hour = 20
> melt_rate = 2 / 15
These lines define the number of snowballs Jay wants to make, the number
of snowballs he can make per hour, and the rate at which they melt.
This is correct.
> answer = 0
> while num_of_snowballs > 0:
> num_of_snowballs += snowballs_per_hour
> num_of_snowballs -= melt_rate * snowballs_per_hour
> answer += 1
This piece of code simulates the process of making snowballs. However,
there’s a problem with the loop
condition. The loop will continue to run until Jay has more than 60
snowballs, but he only wants to make 60 snowballs, not more than 60
snowballs. Also, the rate of snowballs melting is given in terms of
snowballs per 15 minutes, so we need to convert it to snowballs per
hour to make the calculation easier.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
# Define the number of snowballs Jay wants to make
num_of_snowballs = 60
# Define the number of snowballs Jay can make per hour
snowballs_per_hour = 20
# Define the rate at which the snowballs melt
melt_rate = 2 * 4 / 60 # 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes
# Calculate the number of hours it will take to make the snowballs
num_of_hours = num_of_snowballs / snowballs_per_hour
# Calculate the number of snowballs that will melt during that time
num_of_melted_snowballs = melt_rate * num_of_hours * snowballs_per_hour
# Calculate the number of snowballs that will be left after melting
num_of_snowballs_left = num_of_snowballs - num_of_melted_snowballs
answer = num_of_hours

Question: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers
who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour.
Janet has to pay 10% of her workers’ salaries in FICA taxes. If
everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet
owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?
‘‘‘python
num_of_warehouse_workers = 4
num_of_managers = 2
wage_of_warehouse_workers = 15
wage_of_managers = 20
num_of_days = 25
num_of_hours = 8
total_hours = num_of_days * num_of_hours
total_wage = num_of_warehouse_workers * wage_of_warehouse_workers *
total_hours + num_of_managers * wage_of_managers * total_hours
answer = total_wage * 1.1
‘‘‘
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 22000.0
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The total wages and taxes should be positive, 22000 > 0, it’s
reasonable.
2. Let’s check the code:
> # Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who
make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour.
> num_of_warehouse_workers = 4
46

> num_of_managers = 2
> wage_of_warehouse_workers = 15
> wage_of_managers = 20
This defines the number of warehouse workers and managers, and their
wages, this is correct.
> num_of_days = 25
> num_of_hours = 8
> total_hours = num_of_days * num_of_hours
It calculates the total hours of working 25 days a month and 8 hours a
day, that’s right.
> total_wage = num_of_warehouse_workers * wage_of_warehouse_workers *
total_hours + num_of_managers * wage_of_managers * total_hours
It calculates the total wage, this is correct.
> answer = total_wage * 1.1
Janet has to pay 10% taxes, 1 + 0.1 = 1.1, that code calculates the total
wage and taxes for one month, that’s correct.
Overall, the code understood the meaning of the question correctly and
did not miss any information, and the answer 22000 is reasonable.
However, there are some improvements that can be made to make the
code more concise and easier to read.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
# Define the wages for the workers
warehouse_wage = 15
manager_wage = 20
# Define the number of employees in each category
num_warehouse_workers = 4
num_managers = 2
# Calculate the total number of hours worked in a month
num_days = 25
hours_per_day = 8
total_hours = num_days * hours_per_day
# Calculate the total wages for the workers
warehouse_wages = num_warehouse_workers * warehouse_wage * total_hours
manager_wages = num_managers * manager_wage * total_hours
total_wages = warehouse_wages + manager_wages
# Calculate the total FICA taxes owed
fica_rate = 0.10
total_fica_tax = total_wages * fica_rate
# Calculate the total amount owed
total_owed = total_wages + total_fica_tax
answer = total_owed

Question: A farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more cows than
goats. If the farmer has 56 animals total, how many pigs does he have?
‘‘‘python
num_of_pigs = 2 * num_of_cows
47

num_of_cows = number_of_goats + 4
num_of_animals = 56
number_of_goats = (num_of_animals - 4) / 3
num_of_cows = (number_of_goats + 4) * 2
answer = num_of_cows
‘‘‘
Execution: NameError("name ’num_of_cows’ is not defined")
Output: answer = None
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The above code causes the "NameError" because it use the variable ‘
num_of_cows‘ before it is defined.
2. The variable names in the code are a little bit confusing, becase both
‘num_of_pigs‘ and "number_of_goats" are used.
Let’s analysis the problem, we know that the total number of animals are
56, but we don’t konw the number of pigs, cows or goats, and we can’t
get any of them directly, so we can build equations to solve for the
number of pigs.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
# let’s define the number of goats is x
# then the number of cows is 4+x
# then the number of pigs is 2(4+x)
# so, total animals is x + (4+x) + 2(4+x) = 56
# Now we can solve for "x":
# x + 4 + x + 2x + 8 = 56
# 4x + 12 = 56
# 4x = 44
# x = 11
# So the farmer has 11 goats.
num_of_goats = 11
num_of_cows = num_of_goats + 4
# calculate the answer given the number of goats
num_of_pigs = 2 * num_of_cows
answer = num_of_pigs

Question: Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into
4 pieces. If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate
eat 75% of the pizzas, how many pizza pieces are left uneaten?
‘‘‘python
num_of_pieces_per_pizza = 4
num_of_pizza = 4
num_of_pieces = num_of_pieces_per_pizza * num_of_pizza
num_of_pieces_eaten_by_bill_and_dale = num_of_pieces * 0.5
num_of_pieces_eaten_by_ann_and_cate = num_of_pieces * 0.75
answer = num_of_pieces - num_of_pieces_eaten_by_bill_and_dale -
num_of_pieces_eaten_by_ann_and_cate
‘‘‘
Execution: Done
Output: answer = -4.0
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The number of pizza pieces left uneaten should be a positive integer,
-4.0 < 0, so the answer is not reasonable.
2. Let’s check the code:
48

> # Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4
pieces.
> num_of_pieces_per_pizza = 4
> num_of_pizza = 4
> num_of_pieces = num_of_pieces_per_pizza * num_of_pizza
It calculates the total number of pieces ‘num_of_pieces‘, that’s correct.
> # Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate eat 75% of the
pizzas
> num_of_pieces_eaten_by_bill_and_dale = num_of_pieces * 0.5
> num_of_pieces_eaten_by_ann_and_cate = num_of_pieces * 0.75
According to the question, each person only eats their own personal pan
pizza, ‘num_of_pieces * 0.5‘ means 50% of the total pieces, this is
wrong.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
pizza_pieces = 4 # each person buys a personal pan pizza cut into 4
pieces
ann_pieces = 4 * 0.75 # Ann eats 75% of her pizza
bill_pieces = 4 * 0.5 # Bill eats 50% of his pizza
cate_pieces = 4 * 0.75 # Cate eats 75% of her pizza
dale_pieces = 4 * 0.5 # Dale eats 50% of his pizza
total_pieces_eaten = ann_pieces + bill_pieces + cate_pieces + dale_pieces
total_pieces = pizza_pieces * 4 # there are 4 people
pieces_left = total_pieces - total_pieces_eaten

Question: Tommy is making 12 loaves of bread. He needs 4 pounds of flour
per loaf. A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs
$13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so
he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour
if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough?
‘‘‘python
num_of_loaves = 12
pounds_of_flour_per_loaf = 4
pounds_of_flour = num_of_loaves * pounds_of_flour_per_loaf
pounds_per_bag = 10
cost_of_10_pounds_bag = 10
cost_of_12_pounds_bag = 13
num_of_10_pounds_bag = pounds_of_flour / pounds_per_bag
num_of_12_pounds_bag = pounds_of_flour / pounds_per_bag
answer = min(num_of_10_pounds_bag * cost_of_10_pounds_bag,
num_of_12_pounds_bag * cost_of_12_pounds_bag)
‘‘‘
Execution: Done
Output: answer = 48.0
What’s the problem with the above code?
1. The cost of flour should be a positive number, 48 > 0, it’s reasonable.
2. Let’s check the code:
> num_of_loaves = 12
> pounds_of_flour_per_loaf = 4
49

> pounds_of_flour = num_of_loaves * pounds_of_flour_per_loaf
It calculates the total pounds of flour needed, that’s correct.
> # A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13
> pounds_per_bag = 10 # ‘pounds_per_bag‘ is ambiguous since there’re two
kinds of bags
> cost_of_10_pounds_bag = 10
> cost_of_12_pounds_bag = 13
> num_of_10_pounds_bag = pounds_of_flour / pounds_per_bag
> num_of_12_pounds_bag = pounds_of_flour / pounds_per_bag # 12-pound bag
has 12 pounds rather than 10, that’s wrong
There’s problems in calculating the number of bags needed. In addition,
the number of bags should be integer, and to get enough flour we
should round up.
> answer = min(num_of_10_pounds_bag * cost_of_10_pounds_bag,
num_of_12_pounds_bag * cost_of_12_pounds_bag)
This piece code calculates the cheapest cost of flour, it’s correct.
In summary, the code makes errors in calculating the cost.
To solve the problem, we first need to calculate how many pounds of flour
Tommy needs in total. Then we need to compare the cost of buying a
10-pound bag of flour versus a 12-pound bag of flour and choose the
cheaper option to get the required amount of flour.
Here’s a better solution:
‘‘‘python
import math
# Calculate how many pounds of flour Tommy needs
num_of_loaves = 12
pounds_of_flour_per_loaf = 4
total_pounds_of_flour = num_of_loaves * pounds_of_flour_per_loaf
cost_of_10_pounds_bag = 10
cost_of_12_pounds_bag = 13
# Calculate the number of bags needed
num_of_10_pounds_bag = math.ceil(total_pounds_of_flour / 10)
num_of_12_pounds_bag = math.ceil(total_pounds_of_flour / 12)
# Calculate the cost of flour
cost_of_10_pounds = num_of_10_pounds_bag * cost_of_10_pounds_bag

the length of prompts and therefore reduce the inference cost. If the answer is not even plausible, we
assign ‘(D) absolutely wrong’ to indicate the least conﬁdence.
Listing 27: Prompts for CRITIC (plausibility) on hallucination detection with AmbigNQ.
Check whether the answer is plausible. If an answer misunderstands the
question, or repeat the question, or gives a None / I don’t know /
Unknown answer, then it’s not plausible.
Question: When did men’s figure skating become a summer Olympic sport?
Reasoning Process: Men’s figure skating has never been a summer Olympic
sport. It has been a part of the Winter Olympics since the first
Winter Olympics in 1924. So the answer is: never
Proposed Answer: never
Plausibility: The question ask for a date, and the answer "never" does
not provide a date. So it’s not plausible.
Question: The market town which houses the St Mary and St Nicolas church
has haw many people?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The question is asksing
about the population of a market town that houses a specific church.
We don’t have any information about the population of the town, so we
can’t answer this question. So the answer is: We don’t have enough
information to answer this question.
Proposed Answer: We don’t have enough information to answer this question
Plausibility: The question asks for a number, and the answer "We don’t
have enough information to answer this question" does not provide an
answer. So it’s not plausible.
Question: What was the name of the 1929 novel written by the author whose

york specifically, and the answer is "New York City", which is too
broad and does not provide a specific location. So it’s not plausible.
Listing 28: Prompts for CRITIC (truthfulness) on hallucination detection with AmbigNQ.
Analyze the following questions and proposed answers, and search for
sufficient evidence to prove whether the proposed answer are correct.
- You should point out possible errors in the reasoning process, but
ultimately you should only determine whether the proposed answer is
correct (it is possible for the answer to be correct when the
reasoning process is incorrect).
Question: When was the last time the USA men’s national soccer team
missed the World Cup?
Reasoning Process: The last time the USA men’s national soccer team
missed the World Cup was in 1986. So the answer is: 1986
Proposed Answer: 1986
Verify #1: We need to check whether the last time the USA men’s national
soccer team missed the World Cup was in 1986.
> Search Query: When was the last time the USA men’s national soccer team
missed the World Cup?
> Evidence: [United States at the FIFA World Cup - Wikipedia] The United
States participated in every World Cup from 1990 through 2014, but
did not qualify in 2018, marking first time the team had missed a
World Cup since 1986 . They returned to the World Cup by qualifying
for the 2022 edition .
The evidence suggests that the USA men’s national soccer team did not
qualify for the World Cup in 2018, but qualify for 2022, 2018 > 1986,
so the last time the USA men’s national soccer team missed the World
Cup was in 2018, not in 1986, which contradicts the proposed answer.
Conclusion: the USA men’s national soccer team did not qualify for the
World Cup in 1986 and 2018, and 2018 was the last time, not 1986 in
the answer. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
58

The proposed answer should be: (D)

Question: What does barium do in a ct scan?
Reasoning Process: Barium is used in CT scans to help highlight the
digestive system. So the answer is: highlight the digestive system
Proposed Answer: highlight the digestive system
Verify #1: We need to check whether barium’s function in CT scans is to
help highlight the digestive system.
> Search Query: Why barium used in CT scans?
> Evidence: [What To Expect Before Your CT Scan - St. Elizabeth’s Medical
Center] The barium helps to highlight body areas for the CT scan. If
you are having a scan of a body part other than the abdomen you
should arrive 30 minutes before your appointed time.
The evidence suggests that barium helps "highlight body areas" for the CT
scan, not specifically the digestive system. However, it is possible
that barium is used to highlight the digestive system in many cases,
so the proposed answer is not complete. We can further search to
make sure.
> Search Query: What is barium’ function in a CT scan? site: wikipedia.
org
> Evidence: [Barium sulfate suspension - Wikipedia] Barium sulfate
suspension , often simply called barium , is a contrast agent used
during X-rays . [1] Specifically it is used to improve visualization
of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, intestines) on
plain X-ray or computed tomography .
The evidence suggests that barium is used to "improve visualization of
the gastrointestinal tract", which includes the digestive system.
Therefore, the proposed answer should be more specific by staing "
improve visualization".
Conclusion: While the answer "highlight the digestive system" is a common
usage of barium in CT scans, it is not a complete description of
barium’s function. A more complete answer would be "to improve
visualization of the gastrointestinal tract." Therefore, the proposed
answer is probably wrong.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (C)

Question: Where was the fort located at which the first shot of the civil
war was fired?
Reasoning Process: The first shot of the Civil War was fired at Fort
Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. So the answer is: Fort Sumter

> Evidence: [Civil War Begins - U.S. Senate] At 4:30 a.m. on April 12,
1861, Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in South Carolina’s
Charleston Harbor. Less than 34 hours later, Union forces surrendered.
Traditionally, this event has been used to mark the beginning of the
Civil War.
The evidence suggests that the first shot of the Civil War was fired at
Fort Sumter, which is consistent with the proposed answer.
Verify #2: We then need to check whether Fort Sumter is located in
Charleston, South Carolina.
> Search Query: Where is Fort Sumter located?
> Evidence: [Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park (U.S.
National ...] Fort Sumter is located in the middle of Charleston
59

Harbor, and is only accessible by ferry rides through Fort Sumter
Tours.
The evidence suggests that Fort Sumter is located in Charleston Harbor.
Conclusion: From #1 and #2 we know that the first shot of the Civil War
was fired at Fort Sumter, and Fort Sumter is located in Charleston,
the reasoning process is correct. However, it’s worth noting that the
proposed answer only states "Fort Sumter" but not specifying the
location, which does not answer the question. Therefore, the proposed
answer is probably wrong.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (C)

1992.
> Search Query: When did Nando’s first open in the UK?
> Evidence: [Nando’s - Wikipedia] Nando’s opened its first restaurants
within the United Kingdom , in 1992, in the west London suburbs of
Ealing and Earls Court , initially focusing on takeaway food.
The evidence suggests that Nando’s first opened in the UK in 1992, which
is consistent with the proposed answer.
Conclusion: From the evidence we can see that the proposed answer "1992"
is correct.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (A)

in the flintstones movie.
> Search Query: Who played Wilma’s mom in the flintstones movie?
> Evidence: [Elizabeth Taylor] The Flintstones / Wilma Flintstone /
Mother / Played by
The evidence shows that Elizabeth Taylor played the role of Wilma’s
mother, which contradicts the "Elizabeth Perkins" in the proposed
answer. We can change query and search more evidence to make sure.
> Search Query: What is Elizabeth Perkins’s role in The Flintstones?
> Evidence: [Wilma Flintstone] The Flintstones / Elizabeth Perkins /
Character
The evidence shows that Elizabeth Perkins did appear in The Flintstones
movie as Wilma Flintstone, but not as Wilma’s mother. Therefore, the
proposed answer is incorrect.
Conclusion: The proposed answer, "Elizabeth Perkins," is incorrect as
Elizabeth Taylor played the role of Wilma’s mother in The Flintstones
movie.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct

Radcliffe Society of Physics Students.
The evidence does not explicitly state that the Ig Nobel Price was
instigated by Harvard University. However, given that Harvard-
Radcliffe Science Fiction Association and the Harvard-Radcliffe
Society of Physics Students co-sponsored the prize, it is highly
likely that Harvard University played a significant role in the
instigation of the prize.
Conclusion: The evidence suggests that Harvard University played a
significant role in the Ig Nobel Prize, but the exact nature of
Harvard’s involvement is not entirely clear. Therefore, the proposed
answer that "Harvard University" instigated the prize is likely
correct.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (B)

Question: Three people have featured on the reverse of the £5 note, the
two most recent are George Stephenson and Elizabeth Fry, who was the
first?
Reasoning Process: The first person to feature on the reverse of the £5
note was Sir Isaac Newton. So the answer is: Sir Isaac Newton.
Proposed Answer: Sir Isaac Newton
63

Verify #1: We need to check whether Sir Isaac Newton was the first person
to feature on the reverse of the £5 note.
> Search Query: Who was the first person to feature on the reverse of the

Question: What is the name of the passenger train that is now part of the
Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak, that ends
in Los Angeles, California?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The Texas Eagle is a 1,306-
mile train route operated by Amtrak. It ends in Los Angeles,
California. So the name of the passenger train that is now part of
the Texas Eagle is the Texas Eagle. So the answer is: Texas Eagle.
Proposed Answer: Texas Eagle
Is the answer plausible? The question asks for the name of the passenger
train, and the answer is "Texas Eagle", which contradicts the "that
is now part of the Texas Eagle" in the question. So it’s not
plausible.
Question: The market town which houses the St Mary and St Nicolas church
has haw many people?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The question is asking about
the population of a market town that houses a specific church. We
don’t have any information about the population of the town, so we
can’t answer this question. So the answer is: We don’t have enough
information to answer this question.
Proposed Answer: We don’t have enough information to answer this question
Is the answer plausible? The question asks for a number, and the answer "
We don’t have enough information to answer this question" does not
provide an answer. So it’s not plausible.

metalcore genre. Metalcore is a subgenre of heavy metal and hardcore
punk. So Serianna is a band of heavy metal and hardcore punk. So the
answer is: heavy metal and hardcore punk.
Proposed Answer: heavy metal and hardcore punk
Is the answer plausible? The question asks for the genre of a band, and
the answer is "heavy metal and hardcore punk", simply repeat and
contradict the question, since it’s not reasonable that "heavy metal
and hardcore punk" combines elements of itself. So it’s not plausible.

Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. Eric Estornel, better known
by his stage names Maceo Plex and Maetrik, is an American DJ,
producer and DJ Awards winner. He is best known for diverse
production style, as well as a longtime performer for many Ibiza-
based clubs, including Space. The owner of Space is not mentioned in
the question. So the answer is: The owner of Space is not mentioned
in the question.

answer is "Mondkopf born Paul Régimbeau in Toulouse, France", which
misunderstands the question. So it’s not plausible.
Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern
sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The Colorado orogeny is a
mountain-building event that occurred in the western United States.
The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into the Great
Plains. The Great Plains are a vast area of flat land that extends
from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River. The elevation
range for the Great Plains is from about 1,000 to 2,000 feet. So the
answer is: 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
Proposed Answer: 1,000 to 2,000 feet
Is the answer plausible? The question asks for the elevation range, and
the answer is "1,000 to 2,000 feet", which is a elevation range. So
it’s plausible.
Question: Peston on Sunday is hosted by the reporter who got the scoop on
which financial crisis in the late-2000s?
Proposed Answer: Let’s think step by step. Peston on Sunday is hosted by
Robert Peston. Robert Peston got the scoop on the financial crisis in
the late-2000s. So the answer is: the financial crisis in the late
-2000s.
Is the answer plausible? The question asks for "which financial crisis",
and the answer is "the financial crisis in the late-2000s", which
just repeat the question. So it’s not plausible.
Listing 32: Prompts for CRITIC (truthfulness) on hallucination detection with HotpotQA.
Analyze the following questions and proposed answers, and search for
sufficient evidence to prove whether the proposed answer are correct.
- You should point out possible errors in the reasoning process, but
ultimately you should only determine whether the proposed answer is
correct (it is possible for the answer to be correct when the
reasoning process is incorrect).
Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern
sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The Colorado orogeny is a
mountain-building event that occurred in the western United States.
The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into the Great
Plains. The Great Plains are a vast area of flat land that extends
from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River. The elevation
range for the Great Plains is from about 1,000 to 2,000 feet. So the
answer is: 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
Proposed Answer: 1,000 to 2,000 feet
Verify #1: We need to check whether the area that the eastern sector of
the Colorado orogeny extends into is the Great Plains.
> Search Query: The eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into
what? site: wikipedia.org
> Evidence: [Colorado orogeny - Wikipedia] The eastern sector extends
into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
The above evidence suggests that the eastern sector extends into "the
High Plains", which differs from "the Great Plains" in the reasoning
process, and we need to search to confirm their difference.
> Search Query: Is the High Plains also called the Great Plains?
66

> Evidence: [High Plains (United States) - Wikipedia] The High Plains are
a subregion of the Great Plains, mainly in the Western United States,
but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South
Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains
before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains.
The above evidence confirms that the High Plains are a subregion of the
Great Plains, so "the Great Plains" in the answer not quite accurate.
Verify #2: We then need to check whether to elevation range of the High
Plains is consistent with the answer 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
> Search Query: What is the elevation range of The High Plains? site:
wikipedia.org
> Evidence: [High Plains (United States) - Wikipedia] From east to west,
the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550
to 2,130 m).
The above evidence shows that the elevation range for the High Plains is
from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, which is also significantly different
from the proposed answer of 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
Conclusion: As the eastern sector extends into the High Plains, and the
High Plains have an elevation range from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Therefore, the proposed answer is most likely wrong.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (D)

Question: Who was once considered the best kick boxer in the world,
however he has been involved in a number of controversies relating to
his "unsportsmanlike conducts" in the sport and crimes of violence
outside of the ring.
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. The best kick boxer in the
world is considered to be Buakaw Banchamek. Buakaw Banchamek has been
involved in a number of controversies relating to his "
unsportsmanlike conducts" in the sport and crimes of violence outside
of the ring. So the answer is: Buakaw Banchamek.
Proposed Answer: Buakaw Banchamek
Verify #1: We first need to check whether Buakaw Banchamek once
considered the best kick boxer in the world.
> Search Query: Who was once considered the best kick boxer in the world?
> Evidence: [Top 10 Best Kickboxer in the World - KreedOn] Topping the
list of best kickboxer in the world is none other than Giorgio
Petrosyan. Nicknamed the Doctor because of his technical prowess and
unmatched abilities, he had a career record of 104-3-2 . Ever since
his debut in 2003, the Armenian-Italian fighter has had one heck of a
career.
The evidence states that Giorgio Petrosyan is topping the best kick boxer
in the world, however, there can be many best kick boxers, we need
further check.
- Seach Query: Was Buakaw Banchamek once considered the best kick boxer
in the world?
> Evidence: [Best Kickboxers Of All Time - Top 10 - LowKickMMA] You can
just say the name Buakaw and everyone will agree he’s one of the best
kickboxers of all time. Buakaw Banchamek has been a professional
fighter since the time he was 9 years old. Today, he is 39 years old
and still considered one of the best in the sport.
The evidence supports the answer, Buakaw Banchamek was considered one of
the best kick boxers of all time.
Verify #2: We should check whether Buakaw Banchamek have "unsportsmanlike
conducts" in the sport.
> Search Query: Buakaw Banchamek unsportsmanlike conduct in sport
67

> Evidence: [Unlocking The History Of Muay Thai ...] The use of head-
butts, biting, and other unsportsmanlike conduct is ... Muay Thai

The evidence does not indicate that Buakaw Banchamek has "unsportsmanlike
conduct" in sport.
> Search Query: Has Buakaw Banchamek been accused of "unsportsmanlike
conduct" in sport?
> Evidence: [300-fight muay Thai legend Buakaw explains unexpected BKFC
...] Buakaw Banchamek is a legend in muay Thai, who has turned down
MMA and boxing ...
Buakaw chose bareknuckle over MMA or another combat sport.
Missing: accused "unsportsmanlike conduct"
The evidence does not provide clear information, so we cannot verify or
refute #2.
Verify #3: We also need to check whether Buakaw Banchamek had crimes of
violence outside of the ring
> Search Query: Buakaw Banchamek crimes of violence
> Evidence: [Tough guy Buakaw strikes a blow against domestic violence
...] Muay Thai legend Buakaw has been selected to star in a United
Nations campaign against violence toward women.
The evidence suggests that Buakaw has been selected to star against
violence toward women, so it’s unlikely that he has committed crimes
of violence.
Conclusion: Although Buakaw Banchamek was once considered the best kick
boxer in the world, we can’t find evidence to support Buakaw
Banchamek’s "unsportsmanlike conducts" or crimes of violence, the
proposed answer is probably wrong.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (C)

Question: Which magazine was started first Arthur’s Magazine or First for
Women?
Reasoning Process: Let’s think step by step. Arthur’s Magazine was
started in 1892. First for Women was started in 1994. So Arthur’s
Magazine was started first. So the answer is: Arthur’s Magazine.
Proposed Answer: Arthur’s Magazine
Verify #1: We need to check whether Arthur’s Magazine was started in 1892.

the evidence shows that "Vogue" was started in 1892, but not provide
enough infomation about the start date of Arthur’s Magazine, we need
further search.
> Search Query: When was Arthur’s Magazine started?
> Evidence: [October 2002] Arthur.../...First issue date
The evidence only say that the issue date of "Arthur" (not "Arthur’s
Magazine") is 2002, and this is still not enough to verify #1, we
need further search.
> Search Query: When was "Arthur’s Magazine" started?
> Evidence: [Arthur’s Magazine - Wikipedia] Arthur’s Magazine (1844-1846)
was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the
19th century. Edited by Timothy Shay Arthur , it featured work by
Edgar A. Poe , J.H.
The evidence suggests that Arthur’s Magazine was started in 1844, not
1892, which contradicts #1.
68

Verify #2: We then need to check whether First for Women was started in
1994.
> Search Query: When was First for Women started?
> Evidence: [First for Women - Wikipedia] First for Women is a woman’s
magazine published by A360media in the USA. [1]... The magazine was
started in 1989 by Bauer Media Group . [2]... In 2011 the circulation
of the magazine was 1,310,696 copies.
The evidence suggests that First for Women was started in 1989, not in
1994 as claimed in #2.
Conclusion: From #1 and #2 we know that Arthur’s Magazine was started in
1844, and First for Women was started in 1989, the date in reasoning
process is inaccurate. Nevertheless, 1844 < 1989, the proposed answer
that "Arthur’s Magazine" started first happens to be correct.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
(B) probably correct
(C) probably wrong
(D) absolutely wrong
The proposed answer should be: (A)

The evidence suggests that Colette wrote a novel named "Chéri", but it’s
a 1920 novel, which is inconsistent with "1929 novel" in the question.
Conclusion: The novel "Chéri" was written by Colette, however, it was a
1920 novel, so the proposed answer is wrong.
In summary, the proposed answer should be:
(A) absolutely correct
