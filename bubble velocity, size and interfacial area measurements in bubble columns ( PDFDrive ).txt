The knowledge of bubble properties, including bubble velocity, bubble size, gas holdup, 
and specific interfacial area, is of importance for the proper design and operation of 
bubble columns. A four-point optical probe was adopted in this study to measure bubble 
properties in such systems. An improved algorithm for data processing was developed, 
which extends the capability of the probe and improves the accuracy of the measurement. 
The new algorithm provides both the magnitude and direction angles of the bubble 
velocity vector. The results from the probe and the algorithm were validated against 
video imaging and it was established that the bubble velocity distribution, bubble chord 
length distribution, local gas holdup, and specific interfacial area obtained by the four-
point optical probe are reliable. 
 

 
 
The four-point optical probe measurements of bubble properties were taken in an air-
water system using a 16.2cm (6.4”) diameter bubble column at elevated pressure, up to 
1.0 MPa, and at high superficial gas velocity, up to 60 cm/s, equipped with three different 
gas spargers. 
 
It was established that gas holdup radial profiles evolve from flat at low superficial gas 
velocity to highly parabolic at high superficial gas velocity. Specific interfacial area 
profiles, bubble mean velocity profiles, and bubble frequency profiles exhibit the same 
trends. Bubble velocity distributions change from unimodal to bimodal with increase in 
superficial gas velocity. However, only unimodal bubble size distributions were 
observed. The effects of pressure, spargers, and elevation in the column are also 
illustrated. 
 
This study establishes the four-point probe as a useful tool for study of bubble properties 
in actual bubble columns.

Chapter 1  Introduction 
 
1.1  Motivation 
 
Bubble column reactors are used extensively to perform a wide variety of gas/liquid or 
gas/liquid/solid reactions, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, chlorination, aerobic 
fermentation, waste water treatment, and coal liquefaction (De Swart and Krishna, 1995; 
Jager and Espinoza, 1995; Shollenberger et al., 1997; Eisenberg et al., 1994; Davis, 
2002). The main advantages of bubble columns over other multiphase reactors (stirred 
vessels, packed towers, trickle bed reactors etc.) include simple construction, low 
maintenance due to the absence of moving parts, excellent heat transfer properties, easy 
temperature control, and reasonable interphase mass transfer rates at low energy input. 
 
The knowledge of bubble properties, including bubble velocity, bubble size, gas holdup, 
and specific interfacial area, is of considerable importance for the proper design and 
operation of bubble columns. For example, the overall mass transfer rate per unit volume 
of the dispersion in a bubble column is governed by the liquid-side volumetric mass 
transfer coefficient (kla), assuming that the gas-side resistance is negligible. In a bubble 
column reactor, the variation in kla is primarily due to variations in the specific interfacial 
area, a. The specific gas-liquid interfacial area, a, is related to the gas holdup, εg, and the 
bubble size distribution, while the gas holdup is determined by the bubble size 
distribution, bubble velocity (i.e., bubble residence time), and bubble frequency. In the 
same way, bubble properties play key roles in determining the heat transfer rate in bubble 
columns (Yang et al., 2000). Furthermore, bubble size distribution and bubble velocity 
distribution are key parameters in evaluating the drag forces on bubbles and in using the 
bubble population balance in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

However, the measurement of bubble size, bubble velocity, and specific interfacial area 
in two and three-phase systems has always been a challenging problem. The problem is 
even much more complex when the system being considered is no longer in the bubbly 
flow regime, but rather in the chaotic churn-turbulent flow regime and at high pressure, 
conditions which are of industrial interest. 
 
The appeal of non-invasive techniques has led to attempts to capture the bubble size 
distribution bubble velocity distribution by video imaging techniques (Patel, Daly and 
Buckar, 1990; Idogawa, 1997; Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997a; Mihai and 
Pincovschi, 1998; Marques et al., 1999). However, video imaging can be used only in 2-
D transparent columns at low gas holdup, where light can penetrate the system. In real 3-
D columns, even with transparent walls, this technique provides no hope of capturing 
anything beyond the reactor wall. Video imaging also cannot be used in systems where 
the columns are operated at high temperature and high pressure and thus cannot be made 
of transparent materials. Thus, invasive techniques are still the state of the art when it 
comes to bubble size and bubble velocity measurements in practical 3-D multiphase 
systems. 
 
In recent years, optical and conductivity microprobes have been most frequently 
employed to investigate bubble properties (Vince et al., 1982; Matsuura and Fan, 1984; 
Lee, De Lasa and Bergougnou, 1986; Saxena, Rao and Saxena, 1990; Chabot et al., 1992; 
Kuncova, Zahradnik and Mach, 1993; Groen et al., 1996; Farag et al., 1997; Luo et al., 
1998; A. Cartellier, 1998; Mudde and Saito, 2001). Conductivity probes utilize the 
difference in electrical conductivity between the liquid phase and the gas phase. Optical 
fiber probes make use of the difference in the refractive index between the gas phase and 
the liquid phase and provide a sequence of voltage pulses when a bubble passes by the 
probe. In comparison with conductivity probes, optical probes offer significant 
advantages: 1) They can be used in conductive as well as non-conductive (organic) 
systems, which are important in the petrochemical industry. 2) The presence of a liquid 
film on the sensor tip reduces the effectiveness of a conductivity probe but not that of an 

 
3
optical probe. Therefore the sensitivity of optical probes is higher than that of 
conductivity probes (van der Lans, 1985). 3) Optical probes achieve a much better 
signal/noise ratio than conductivity probes. 
 
At present, optical probes have been used mainly to determine bubble size and velocity 
for individual bubbles in bubbly flows of modest gas holdup. There is no firm 
experimental data or theory that can guide us as to how to use these probes and interpret 
their signals in churn-turbulent flow with significant bubble coalescence and re-
dispersion and with a wide distribution of bubble sizes. The goal of this work is to 
explore what bubble phase information can be obtained in churn-turbulent flows using 
optical probe and make necessary modifications to the data processing algorithm. 
 
For many years now, Washington University’s Chemical Reaction Engineering 
Laboratory (CREL) has used Computer Tomography (CT) and Computer Automated 
Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT) to investigate the gas holdup distribution and the 
liquid phase recirculation in bubble columns. The gas holdup obtained by the optical 
probe in the current study can be compared with values already obtained by CT for 
validation. Moreover, gas holdup is qualitatively determined by the bubble velocity and 
the bubble size distribution. Hence, by investigating these bubble properties, the 
mechanism for changes in the gas holdup profiles with changing operating conditions can 
be disclosed. Furthermore, in bubble columns the liquid recirculation derives from and 
interacts with bubble properties. Hence, the combination of the measurement results from 
CARPT with bubble properties obtained by the probe can give a clearer understanding of 
the hydrodynamics in bubble columns. 
 
In CFD, the population balance model, applied to gas bubbles, is needed to provide a 
statistical formulation to describe the gas phase in bubble columns. The bubble size and 
velocity distribution functions are employed in the population balance model. So far, 
either a ‘mean’ bubble size is assumed or the bubble size distribution is predicted from 
the bubble breakup and coalescence model. This can be much improved by comparing 

 
4
the experimental results for the bubble velocity and size distribution obtained by the 
probe with the predictions generated by the model. Furthermore, two-fluid model based 
codes (e.g., FLUENT, CFX, CFDLIB) cannot predict well the observed gas holdup radial 
profiles, even in 3D simulations. With the bubble velocity and size distribution obtained 
by the probe, the prediction of the gas holdup profile in CFD can be improved, which 
would substantially increase the capability of CFD modeling of bubble column reactors. 
This improvement, however, is beyond the scope of this thesis. 
 
1.2  Research Objectives 
 
The overall objective of this work is to investigate the bubble velocity distribution, 
bubble chord length distribution, local gas holdup, and specific interfacial area as a 
function of operating conditions (i.e., superficial gas velocity, pressure etc.) in both 
bubbly flow and in churn-turbulent flow in bubble columns. Four major research goals 
are: 
 
(1) Modify the data processing algorithm to improve the capability of the four-point 
optical probe to set up a practical tool for investigating bubble properties in bubble 
columns in both bubbly flow and churn-turbulent flow. 
 
(2) Validate the four-point optical probe and the developed novel data processing 
algorithm versus video imaging in validation setups, e.g., a 2-D bubble column, at 
different conditions. 
 
(3) Use this probe in a 6.4” bubble columns to study the bubble velocity distribution, 
bubble chord length distribution, gas holdup, and the specific interfacial area at 
superficial gas velocity up to 60 cm/s, pressure up to 1.0 MPa, and for different spargers. 
These operating conditions are the same as those at which the CT and CARPT 
experiments were carried out in CREL (Bong Cheng Ong, 2003). These data are 
nonexistent in the literature.

(4) Obtain deeper understanding of the hydrodynamics of bubble columns by analyzing 
such data.

Chapter 2  Background 
 
2.1  Bubbles’ Behavior in (Slurry) Bubble Columns 
 
The research presented in the literature has captured some aspects of the behavior of 
bubbles in bubble columns and slurry bubble columns. The following are the results 
pertinent to this study. 
 
2.1.1  Bubble Shape, Motion, and Size Distribution 
 
Bubbles in motion are generally classified by shape as spherical, oblate ellipsoidal, and 
spherical/ellipsoidal cap, etc. (Figure 2-1). The actual bubble shape depends on the 
relative magnitudes of the forces acting on the bubble, such as surface tension and inertial 
forces (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). When the bubble size is small (for example, volume 
equivalent bubble diameter de<1mm in water), the surface tension force predominates 
and the bubble is approximately spherical. 
 
For bubbles of intermediate size, the effects of both surface tension and the inertia of the 
medium flowing around the bubble are important. As a result, intermediate-size bubbles 
exhibit very complex shapes and motion characteristics. While called ellipsoidal bubbles, 
they often lack fore-and-aft symmetry and, in extreme circumstances, cannot be 
described by any simple regular geometry, due to significant shape fluctuations (Bhaga 
and Weber, 1981). This complex shape results from the superposition of various modes 
of fluctuations that are of different amplitudes and take place at different frequencies 
(Hibino, 1969). The dominant mode of shape fluctuations has been noted to be quite 
periodic and characterized by the extension/contraction of the bubble height/width or vice 
versa, i.e., variation in the bubble aspect ratio (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). 
 

7
 
Large bubbles, whose volumes are larger than 3 cm3 (i.e., de>18mm) in general, are 
dominated by inertial or buoyancy forces, with negligible effects of surface tension and 
viscosity of the liquid media. The bubble is approximately a spherical cap with an 
included angle of about 100o (provided liquid viscosity µl<50 mPa⋅s) and a relatively flat 
or sometimes indented base. The fluctuation in the overall shape becomes suppressed, 
i.e., the main feature of the bubble’s shape fluctuation is the oscillation of the bubble 
base, especially in the edge region (Bhaga and Weber, 1981). 
 
 
Figure 2-1.  Sketches of Various Bubble Shapes Observed in Infinite 
Newtonian Liquid (Bhaga and Weber, 1981) 
 
In multiphase flow systems, bubble size distribution is not constant but changes due to 
breakup and/or coalescence of bubbles caused by bubble-bubble interactions (Domenico 
et al., 1999). The rates of these two processes are associated with the generated bubble 
size and the property of surrounding liquid. In a coalescence-promoting liquid, such as 
water and pure organic liquids, bubbles generated are apt to coalesce, so that the bubble 
size in the fully developed flow region is larger than the initial bubble size generated 

 
8
from the sparger. When a coalescence hindering liquid, such as electrolytes and alcohols, 
are added to an aqueous solution, the initial bubbles generated at the sparger essentially 
do not change in size in the course of rising to the free surface. Accordingly, higher gas 
holdup and specific interfacial area than those encountered in a coalescence-promoting 
liquid can be achieved in a coalescence hindering liquid (Hikita et al., 1980; Heijnen and 
van’t Riet, 1984). It has been reported that whatever the liquid phase, in multiphase flow 
systems the bubble size distributions are very asymmetric and can be represented well by 
the log-normal distribution (Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997a; 
Rajarathinam and Nafis, 1996; Chanson, 1997). 
 
No broadly applicable model for the determination of rates of coalescence and breakup 
has yet been presented, due to both the inaccurate understanding of the physical 
mechanisms that lead to bubble breakup and coalescence, and the enormous difficulty in 
obtaining reliable data, especially at high gas flow rates. The latter is the reason why 
bubble size distribution measurements are not so common in literature, and, often, 
different techniques lead to different measured values. Actually, bubble size in bubble 
columns, including 2D bubble columns, cannot be measured directly, i.e., without any 
assumptions on bubble shape, by any available technique so far, except at some extreme 
conditions, e.g., single bubble rise or a extremely thin 2D bubble column (Spicka et al., 
1999). Methods now available to derive the bubble size distribution include: 
 
(1) Video imaging (Bhaga and Weber, 1981; Domenico et al., 1999; Spicka et al., 1999). 
 
(2) Point probes (Burgess and Calderbank, 1975; Manabu et al., 1995; Wu and Ishii, 
1999; Sanaullah, Zaidi and Hills, 2001; Vince et al., 1982; Yu and Kim, 1988; Chabot et 
al., 1992; Farag et al., 1997; Mudde and Saito, 2001; Xue et al., 2003). 
 
(3) Dynamic gas disengagement technique (Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck, 
1991; Daly, Patel and Bucker, 1992; Deshpande, Dinkar and Joshi, 1995). 
  

 
9
The bubble size distribution obtained by the dynamic gas disengagement method is not 
reliable, due to unrealistic assumptions and too many approximations, e.g., the bubble 
size is obtained from the correlation of bubble size and the terminal rise velocity in a still 
medium and the bubble rise velocities were calculated very roughly (Daly, Patel and 
Bukur, 1992). 
 
Video imaging has been frequently employed to study the behavior of bubbles in bubble 
columns and other gas-liquid contactors. However, it can be used only in transparent 
systems, e.g., 2D systems and 3D systems with very low gas holdup. At high gas holdup, 
video imaging can investigate only the near wall section. Furthermore, to employ video 
imaging, the wall of the multiphase systems investigated must be made of transparent 
material, i.e., glass or Plexiglas, which hinders its application to high pressure systems. 
Hence, video imaging is not suitable for practical systems, which are usually 3D, with 
high gas holdup and opaque walls. 
 
Various point probes can be used in opaque systems. They can be employed at high gas 
holdup and in high pressure systems. However, the model assumed for the bubble shape 
is an important factor affecting the accuracy of the measurement results for the bubble 
size distribution. In general the measurement by point probes requires the transformation 
of bubble chord length distribution, obtained by probes, to bubble size distribution. 
Usually, simple symmetric geometric models are employed to represent bubbles’ shapes. 
The following axially symmetric geometric shape models were customarily used as 
approximations of real bubbles: 
 
(1) In the case of small bubbles, bubbles are modeled as spheres (Batchelor, 1967; 
Harmathy, 1960). 
 
(2) Large bubbles (e.g., over 1.5mm diameter in air-water systems) are represented as 
ellipsoids with a larger horizontal than vertical dimension (Harmathy, 1960; Clark and 
Turton, 1988). 

 
10
 
(3) Very large bubbles, with strong wakes in liquids, are cap-shaped (Hills and Darton, 
1975; Batchelor, 1967), and can be modeled as the top lesser section of an ellipsoid or 
sphere (refer to Figure 2-1). 
 
(4) In fluidized beds, the bubble shape is often termed “spherical cap” (Reuter, 1966; 
Rowe and Widler, 1973), and is modeled by the top greater section of a sphere or 
ellipsoid. 
 
The shape of splitting and coalescing bubbles is very complicated. Data interpretation in 
such circumstances is very difficult, for the shape is not well defined. Furthermore, in 
many situations, e.g., in churn-turbulent flow, due to the bubble shape fluctuation 
mentioned above, the shape of many bubbles is highly irregular and is not constant, so 
that it cannot be represented by any simple geometric model at all. 
 
In gas-liquid upflow, bubbles move faster than the surrounding liquid (due to buoyancy), 
and large bubbles rise more quickly than small bubbles. The motion of bubbles is very 
complex. The rise path and change in orientation of the bubble are known to be strongly 
related to the bubble shape (Fan and Tsuchiya, 1990). The motion of spherical bubbles is 
usually rectilinear. Once the bubble becomes deformed into an oblate ellipsoid, instability 
sets in, and results in a spiral or zigzag trajectory. Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida 
(1997b) found that both the bubble shape and bubble velocity of oblate ellipsoidal 
bubbles exhibit chaotic features. In turn, the fluctuation of the bubble shape is likely to 
cause oscillation of the drag force, leading to the chaotic fluctuation of bubble velocity in 
the streamwise direction. Therefore, in spite of the periodic macroscopic motion, bubbles 
exhibit highly chaotic fluctuations in both the lateral and axial components along the 
zigzag path of the bubble ascent. At the same time, the bubble orientation changes in 
such a way that the bubble major axis tends to be perpendicular to the direction of 
instantaneous motion (Haberman and Morton, 1953). 
 

11
 
As the bubble size increases further, the bubble changes from an ellipsoidal to spherical-
cap shape, the radius of the spiral or the amplitude of the zigzag path gradually decreases 
as bubble size increases, and the motion eventually becomes rectilinear style, but with a 
oscillating component. This rule is generally valid in systems of low Morton number,

2.1.2   Gas Liquid Flow Patterns and Flow Regimes (Hydrodynamics) 
 
Two different types of flow regimes are generally encountered in bubble column 
operation, namely, bubbly flow and churn-turbulent flow. Bubbly flow transits to churn-
turbulent flow as the gas superficial velocity increases above a critical value. Chen, Reese 
and Fan (1994) studied macroscopic flow structures in 3-D bubble columns, at various 
operating conditions in an air-water system at atmospheric pressure, using Particle Image 
Velocimetry (PIV). They described three different flow regimes: the dispersed bubble, 
vortical-spiral flow, and turbulent flow regimes (Figure 2-2). 
 
 
Figure 2-2.  Flow Regimes in a 3-D Bubble Column (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994) 
 

12
 
At low gas velocities, bubble streams are observed to rise rectilinearly with relatively 
uniform size distribution along the column radius. Bubble coalescence and breakup are 
insignificant in this dispersed bubble regime. 
 
With a further increase in superficial gas velocity, bubbles start forming a central bubble 
stream, which moves in an oscillating spiral manner. Bubble coalescence and breakup 
become evident as the gas velocity reaches a certain value (about 2.1 cm/s in an air-water 
system, according to Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994). In the meantime, the rotating 
frequency of the central bubble stream is intensified as the gas velocity increases, which 
results in a more clearly observable spiral motion of the central bubble stream. The 
central bubble stream, which consists of coalesced bubbles and bubble clusters, not only 
spirals upward but also swings laterally back and forth. In the region between the central 
bubble stream and the column wall, tiny bubbles are observed to move up and down. This 
phenomenon indicates the dynamic nature of this region. The general macroscopic flow 
structure of a 3-D column in the vortical-spiral flow regime is displayed in Figure 2-3. 
 
 
Figure 2-3.  Flow Structure in the Vortical-Spiral Flow Regime 
in a 3-D Gas-Liquid Bubble Column (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994) 

 
13
 
For still higher gas velocity ranges (4.2~4.9 cm/s, Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994), large 
bubbles start forming by intensive bubble coalescence, and moving in a sort of “discrete” 
manner, i.e., discrete large bubbles are separated by a certain distance. The spiral flow 
pattern of the central bubble stream gradually breaks down. 
 
Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck (1991) inferred from gas disengagement 
experiments that there are both large and small bubbles in churn-turbulent flow; large 
bubbles constitute the so-called “dilute” phase, and rise rapidly through the core of the 
column, which causes the radial gas holdup profile to be almost parabolic. This non-
uniform gas holdup profile drives liquid circulation, i.e., the liquid rises in the center and 
falls by the wall. The smaller bubbles form the “dense” phase and closely follow the 
liquid, thereby undergoing recirculation with the liquid. Large bubbles rise fast through 
the column virtually in plug flow, while small bubbles display a wide residence time 
distribution. Beyond a certain transition gas velocity, the small bubble holdup remains 
constant, while the large bubble holdup keeps increasing with the gas velocity.  Such a 
‘bimodal’ bubble size distribution is reported by Krishna, Wilkinson and van 
Dierendonck (1991) as a characteristic feature of the churn-turbulent flow regime.  
 
However, Deshpande, Dinkar and Joshi (1995) provided another explanation for the gas 
disengagement experimental results. They thought that the initial faster gas 
disengagement is partly due to internal liquid recirculation instead of due to only the 
presence of very large bubbles, and, hence, claimed that the bimodal bubble size 
distribution is not necessarily proven by results of gas disengagement experiments. 
 
As mentioned before, the video imaging method is limited to 2D systems and 3D systems 
of very low gas holdup. Fan et al. (1999) found that under high-pressure conditions 
bubble coalescence is suppressed, bubble breakup is enhanced, and the distributor tends 
to generate smaller bubbles. All these factors contribute to small bubble sizes and narrow 
bubble size distributions. However, their observation was conducted in bubble columns 

 
14
of small diameter (2” and 4”) and at low gas holdup. Hence, there are no visual or video 
observations available for 3D bubble columns, of larger size and operated at high 
superficial gas velocity and high pressure, to clarify the existence or lack of the bimodal 
bubble size distribution in churn-turbulent flow. By measuring the bubble chord length 
distribution with a four-point optical probe in a bubble column of 6.4” diameter and at 
high superficial gas velocity (up to 60 cm/s) and high pressure (up to 10 bar) in this 
research, it is expected that this issue can be clarified. 
 
2.1.3  Effect of Operating Conditions on Hydrodynamics 
 
The superficial gas velocity is one of the most important factors that affect the 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns. As the superficial gas velocity increases, the flow 
condition in bubble columns changes from bubbly flow to churn-turbulent flow; at the 
same time, the liquid recirculation is enhanced; the Sauter mean bubble diameter 
increases, and the bubble size distribution becomes wider (Olmos et al., 2001). The gas 
holdup radial profile is flat in bubbly flow, and it is parabolic in churn-turbulent flow; in 
bubbly flow the gas holdup increases more rapidly with gas velocity than in churn-
turbulent flow (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994; Kemoun et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2001). 
 
Pressure and temperature affect the behavior of bubbles mainly by varying physical 
properties of fluids (gas density, liquid viscosity, surface tension). In detail, gas density 
increases with pressure and decreases with temperature, the liquid surface tension 
decreases with both pressure and temperature, the liquid viscosity decreases with 
temperature, and the effect of pressure on liquid viscosity is negligible.                         
It was found that the Sauter mean bubble diameter decreases with an increase in pressure 
or temperature; the rise velocity of bubbles decreases with an increase in pressure and a 
decrease in temperature (Fan et al., 1999; Lin, Tsuchiya and Fan, 1998). At elevated 
pressure, the transition from bubbly flow to churn-turbulent flow is delayed (Letzel et al., 
1997). The effect of pressure on gas holdup in the homogeneous regime is insignificant 
(Kolbel et al., 1961; Deckwer et al., 1980). In churn-turbulent flow, gas holdup increases 

 
15
with pressure, and the radial profile of the gas holdup becomes more parabolic (Jiang et 
al., 1995; Fan et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1999b). Consequently, the volumetric mass 
transfer coefficient increases also with pressure (Stegeman et al., 1996). Some 
researchers (Wilkinson and Haringa, 1994; Jiang et al., 1995; Luo et al., 1998) believe 
that as pressure is increased, the bubble size at the distributor is reduced; bubble 
coalescence is suppressed; and large bubbles tend to break up, so that higher pressure 
(gas density) leads to smaller bubbles, and hence to an increase in gas holdup. However, 
in bubbly flow, this could not be confirmed by studies at Sandia National Laboratory 
(Shollenberger et al., 1997). Generally an increase in temperature leads to higher gas 
holdup (Bach and Pilhofer, 1978; Zou et al., 1988; Wilkinson and van Dierendonck, 
1990). The reasons are: (1) Both the surface tension and the liquid viscosity decrease if 
the temperature increases, and lower surface tension and liquid viscosity leads to a higher 
gas holdup. (2) A higher temperature also increases the vapor pressure of the liquid. If the 
feed gas to a bubble column is not saturated, the evaporation of the liquid phase can lead 
to a substantial increase in the volumetric gas flow rate, which subsequently increases the 
gas holdup.  
 
It was reported that column diameters larger than about 15 cm do not affect gas holdup 
much (Chen et al., 1998). On the other hand, the liquid recirculation in a large diameter 
column is stronger than that in a small diameter column (Joshi et al., 1998; Chen et al., 
1998). 
 
The gas distributor also has important effects on bubbles in bubble columns. 
Jamialahmadi and Muller-Steinhagen (1993) found that in the bubbly flow regime, 
bubble size was a strong function of the orifice diameter and the wettability of the gas 
distributor, and a weak function of superficial gas velocity. In the churn-turbulent flow 
regime, this functionality was reversed, i.e., the effect of the sparger on the gas holdup 
and the liquid velocity profile is weak in the fully developed flow region in bubble 
columns. Mikkilineni and Knickle (1987) studied the effect of various porous-plate gas 
distributors (polyethylene, polypropylene, SiC, Al2O3, etc.) on gas holdup and flow 

 
16
pattern in the bubbly flow regime in a bubble column. They reported the following: (1) 
Gas holdup increased with the pore size and distributor thickness, (2) Hydrophobic 
distributor plates gave higher gas holdup than the hydrophilic ones because the 
hydrophilic plates promote bubble coalescence, which results in decreased gas holdup, 
due to different wetting characteristics, and (3) The bubble size was dependent on the 
pore size, gas velocity, and column height and not on the distributor thickness and 
material. 
 
The situation in slurry bubble columns is more complicated. Whether a rising bubble 
behaves as if it were in a “homogeneous” or “heterogeneous” medium depends primarily 
on the ratio of the particle diameter to bubble diameter, i.e., the effect of solid particles on 
bubble characteristics is entirely different in different particle size ranges. In case of 
small particles (less than 100 µm as reported by Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 
1997), no significant difference in bubble size and velocity distribution was observed in 
comparison with two-phase systems. A liquid-solid mixture of small, light particles is 
often regarded as a pseudo-homogeneous medium. On the other hand, in large particle 
systems (larger than 500 µm), increased bubble coalescence and breakup due to the 
presence of large particles take place, resulting in a broader bubble size distribution with 
larger Sauter mean diameter, causing a drop in gas holdup (Darton and Harrison, 1974; 
Lee, Soria and De Lasa, 1990; Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997). 
 
2.1.4  Specific Interfacial Area 
 
Gas-liquid mass transfer in multiphase reactors, e.g., bubble columns, is most frequently 
characterized by the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient kLa. The specific 
interfacial area, a, varies significantly with the hydrodynamic conditions in reactors. For 
the commonly used local two fluid models in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), 
prediction of the interfacial area is one of the major weaknesses. Thus, experimental data 
for the distribution of interfacial area in the entire reactor are of great interest for the 
validation of two fluid models, and for locating zones of low mass transfer in real 

17
 
reactors (Kiambi et al., 2001). Furthermore, the specific interfacial area is one of the key 
parameters that determine the heat and mass transfer in multiphase systems. Hence, it is 
crucial for the design, simulation, and scaleup of bubble columns. 
 
Various physical and chemical methods have been applied to measure the specific 
interfacial area in multiphase flows. 
 
The physical methods include gas disengagement (Patel, Daly and Bukur, 1990), video 
imaging (Akita and Yoshida, 1974; Luewisutthichat, Tsutsumi and Yoshida, 1997; Lage 
and Esposito, 1999; Pohorecki, Moniuk and Zdrojkowski, 1999), Laser Doppler 
Anemometry (LDA) (Kulkarni et al., 2001), and probes (Kiambi et al., 2001; Wu and 
Ishii, 1999). In all the physical methods except video imaging and some probes, the 
specific interfacial area for unit of the bubble column volume, a, is determined from the 
gas holdup and bubble size distribution. The gas-liquid interfacial area can be related to 
the gas holdup, εg, and the Sauter mean diameter (the volume-surface mean diameter of 
bubbles), ds, by:

where db,i is the volume-equivalent diameter of the mid-sized bubbles within the i-th size-
class, and ni is the number of bubbles with size db,i. 
 

18
 
Equation (2-1) is based on the assumption of spherical bubbles, which is not true for most 
practical multiphase systems. Hence, Equation (2-1) is an oversimplification for practical 
multiphase systems. Besides, as mentioned before, the volume-equivalent bubble 
diameter is very difficult to measure accurately in multiphase systems. Hence, Equation 
(2-1) can be treated only as a rough estimate of specific interfacial area. 
 
Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) derived the equation for the specific interfacial area, 
a, in gas-liquid  systems as:

where N is the total number of the gas-liquid interfaces passing by the probe during the 
measurement time ∆T, and φ is the angle between the velocity vector and the normal 
vector of the gas-liquid interface (bubble’s surface). Equation (2-3) provides the probe 
technique with the capability to measure specific interfacial area directly. 
 
The chemical methods (Stegeman et al., 1996; Vazquez et al., 2000; Kulkarni et al., 
2001) are based on the study of reactions of known kinetics in which the absorption rate 
is a function of the interfacial area. The gas-liquid reaction systems are selected in such a 
way that the absorption is accompanied by fast chemical reaction. As a result, the overall 
rate of absorption (Ra) is proportional to the interfacial area, and is given by the 
following equation (Danckwerts, 1970):

where [A*] is the saturation concentration of solute gas (A) in the liquid phase, [B0] is the 
concentration of liquid phase reactive species (B), m and n are the reaction orders with 
respect to A and B, respectively, kmn is the rate constant, and DA is the diffusivity of A in

the liquid phase. Some of the chemical systems with these characteristics reported in the 
literature include: CO2-Aqueous NaOH, CO2-Aqueous diethanolamine, H2- Hydrazine, 
O2-Sodium sulfite. In all the cases, the bracketed term in Equation (2-4)  
(2/(m+1)DAkmn[A*]m+1[B0]n)=F is measured using a model contactor, where a is known a 
priori, over a wide range of [A*], [B0], and temperature. These well characterized 
reaction systems with known F are then used in bubble columns, where the measurement 
of Ra directly gives a  (

The chemical methods have several shortcomings: (1) They can derive only the overall 
value of interfacial area rather than the distribution of specific interfacial area in 
multiphase systems. (2) The addition of chemicals to conduct the chemical reaction may 
change the properties of the investigated system, including the specific interfacial area. 
And (3) they are inconvenient to use, due to the complexity of the principle. 
 
The value of ‘a’ is expected to depend upon column diameter, D, axial position, z, radial 
position, sparger design, gas velocity, the regime of operation, and the nature of gas-
liquid system. 
 
Akita and Yoshida (1974) suggested an empirical correlation for the specific interfacial 
area in bubbly flow in a bubble column for different liquid phases:

Hibiki and Ishii (2002) also derived a semi-theoretical correlation from the interfacial 
area transport equation to provide the mean value of the interfacial area as a function of 
energy dissipation and physical parameters. Their expression is:

In Equation (2-6), ∆ρ is the density difference between phases, and α is the energy 
dissipation rate per unit mass. Equation (2-6) also applies to bubble columns in bubbly 
flow with different liquid phases. Hibiki and Ishii (2002) obtained an agreement between 
the developed semi-theoretical correlation and 459 data points, within an average relative 
deviation of ±22.0%. 
 
With an increase in pressure, the specific interfacial area increases, due to an increase in 
gas holdup and decrease in bubble size. However, measurements of specific interfacial 
area at high pressure are much more complicated than those at atmospheric pressure. 
Wilkinson, Spek and van Dierendonck (1992) developed experimentally the relationship 
between the specific interfacial area at atmospheric pressure and at high pressure in 
bubbly flow:

Equation (2-7) gives a way to estimate the specific interfacial area for high pressure on 
the basis of atmospheric data. However, the accuracy of the prediction of Equation (2-7) 
has not been validated.  
 
An extensive literature survey was performed by Hibiki and Ishii (2002) for existing 
interfacial area values measured by various methods in forced convective bubbly flows 
and bubble columns. Key entries are shown in Table 2-1. It should be noted that the 

 
21
experimental results obtained by different researchers and different methods varied 
considerably, and the difference among the values of the Sauter mean bubble diameter 
(and specific interfacial area) estimated by various empirical equations can easily be as 
much as a factor of two for apparently equal conditions. 
 
In short, measurements of the specific interfacial area in multiphase systems are difficult, 
especially beyond very low gas holdup and in practical systems. As mentioned before, 
the methods employed so far either have serious limitations or are complicated, and the 
results obtained are not reliable.

2.2  Type of Probes Used in Multiphase Systems 
 
In recent years, measurements of bubble behavior have usually been carried out by 
various types of probes (Burgess and Calderbank, 1975; Manabu et al., 1995; Wu and 
Ishii, 1999; Sanaullah, Zaidi and Hills, 2001; Vince et al., 1982; Yu and Kim, 1988; 
Chabot et al., 1992; Farag et al., 1997; Mudde and Saito, 2001). The miniaturization of 
probes using fiber optics or small electrodes makes them good choices for performing 
direct measurements of the bubble velocity and bubble chord length, even at high gas 
flow rates or in opaque systems. A comparison of measurement methods based on 
miniature optical and conductivity probes was presented by Choi and Lee (1990). In 
comparison with conductivity probes, optical probes offer several advantages: (1) They 
can be used in conductive as well as non-conductive (organic) systems, which are 
important in the petrochemical industry. (2) The presence of a liquid film on the sensor 
tip reduces the effectiveness of a conductivity probe but not that of an optical probe, The 
sensitivity of optical probes is therefore higher than that of conductivity probes (van der 
Lans, 1985). (3) The optical probe achieves a much better signal/noise ratio than a 
conductivity probe. 
 
To measure the bubble velocity, at least two probes (tips or measure points) are needed. 
The two probes (or tips, measure points) are placed in the macroscopic flow direction at a 
small distance apart (e.g., 2~3 mm). The bubble velocity is calculated by dividing the 
distance between these two probes by the time interval that the bubble takes to pass 
through the distance between them. The two-point probes used by various researchers 
have different configurations, as shown in Figure 2-4. 

26
 
 
Figure 2-4.  Various Tip Configurations of Two-point Probes (Choi and Lee, 1990) 
 
A two-point conductivity probe used by Wu and Ishii (1999) is shown in Figure 2-5. The 
probe consists of two thin electrodes. The tip of each electrode is exposed to the 
multiphase system. The impedance between the probe tip and the common ground can be 
measured. Owing to the large difference in conductivity between the liquid phase and gas 
bubbles, the impedance signal rises sharply when a bubble passes through the probe. It 
was reported that because the diameter of the probe tips is very small (89 µm in 
diameter), no significant bubble deformation or fragmentation was observed through flow 
visualization for the studied bubble size range between 2 and 4 mm. The time delay of 
the two impedance signals, ∆t, was utilized to characterize the time interval for the 
bubble surface traveling from the front probe tip to the back tip. With a known separation 
of the two probe tips, ∆s, the bubble velocity was obtained as 
. The bubble 
chord length pierced by the two tips of the probe can be obtained as 
, where T

is the time interval that Tip i spent in the bubble. With assumptions on the bubble shape 
(e.g., ellipsoidal bubbles), and by using statistical algorithms, the bubble chord length 
distribution can be transferred to bubble size distribution. However, this method is error 
sensitive, and the bubble size distribution obtained is not reliable. 

27
 
 
Figure 2-5.  Schematic Diagram of a Double-Sensor Conductivity Probe 
(Wu and Ishii, 1999) 
 
In multiphase systems bubbles hit the probe tips randomly. To eliminate the uncertainty 
existing in deducing the bubble size and velocity distribution due to the varying and 
unknown positions at which the probe contacts the bubble frontal surfaces, Burgess and 
Calderbank (1975) developed a five-point conductivity probe (Figure 2-6). The probe 
was designed by symmetrically positioning three tips around and above a central tip so 
that these three tips exist in a horizontal plane. A fifth tip was placed in the same 
horizontal plane as the central tip but somewhat distant from it. By requiring tips 2, 3, 
and 4 to respond almost at the same time, the probe records only those encounters where 
the bubble velocity and bubble vertical axis are coincident with the probe axis within fine 
limits. The response of the fifth tip was used to determine the horizontal dimension of the 
bubble, with the assumption that bubbles are ellipsoidal. 

28

(Burgess and Calderbank, 1975) 
(The probe dimensions: dp=4.43 mm, rp=2.4 mm, and xp=7.02 mm) 
 
In contrast, a two-point probe cannot provide much information on bubbles’ shape. 
Hence, Iguchi, Nakatani and Kawabata (1997) developed a multineedle conductivity 
probe (Figure 2-7) to detect the profile of bubbles rising in molten metal baths. An 
example of the bubble profile detected is also shown in Figure 2-7. The bubble velocity 
was determined by the central needle of the probe, which is actually a two-point probe. 
 

29

and the Bubble Shape Detected (Iguchi, Nakatani and Kawabata, 1997) 
 
Optical probes used by researchers have the same configuration as the conductivity 
probes shown above, except that the tips in the probe are made of optical fibers instead of 
conductors. Optical probes can be classified according to their operating principle into 
light transmission probes and light reflection probes. 
 
A light transmission probe detects the light transmitted across the light path, while a light 
reflection probe detects the light reflected at the probe tip or in the phase around the 
probe tip. Light reflection probes have been more frequently employed because they are 
smaller and more accurate. 
 
An example of light transmission probes can be found in the research of Kuncova, 
Zahradnik and Mach (1993). The probe assembly they used consisted of two separate 
probes (Figure 2-8). A decrease in light transmission at the gap between the two ends of a 
fiber, caused by a passing bubble, was employed as its signal. The gas holdup can be 
obtained as the ratio of light absorbance (500nm) in gas-liquid bed and in air, 

30
 
respectively, because the absorbance is proportional to the retention of air in the probe 
space. An average vertical dimension of bubbles, dv, was calculated from the local gas 
holdup εg, the bubble frequency f, and the bubble velocity v (in this study, v was 
calculated as v = superficial gas velocity/overall gas holdup, obviously this is an 
oversimplification that causes large error): 
f/

. It should be pointed out that 
this equation is a poor approximation to the real value of bubble size. 
 
 
Figure 2-8.  A Light Transmittance Probe (Kuncova, Zahradnik and Mach, 1993) 
 
Kreischer, Moritomi and Fan (1990) used a light transmission probe with a configuration 
shown in Figure 2-9. Probes with this configuration can measure the bubble velocity by 
dividing the distance between the two pairs of probes by the time interval that the bubble 
takes to pass through the distance between them. The vertical bubble size (chord length) 
can be obtained by the product of the bubble velocity and the time spent by the bubble to 
pass through one probe. The gas holdup is calculated as the ratio of the time taken by 
bubbles to pass through the probe gap and the whole experimental time. 
 

31
 
 
Figure 2-9.  A Light Transmittance Probe (Kreischer, Moritomi and Fan, 1990) 
 
The main limitation of all light transmission probes is their large size. The probes in 
Figures 2-8 and 2-9 measure up to several centimeters. These big probes are inconvenient 
to use in small size columns, and would disturb the flow pattern seriously. 
 
The light reflection probes that have been employed by researchers for the bubble size 
distribution and bubble rise velocity measurements are of different configurations. Some 
light reflection probes detect the light reflected from the phase around the probe tip. 
Farag et al. (1997) used a reflective fiber optic sensor (Figure 2-10) to investigate fluid 
dynamic properties in turbulent fluidized beds.  The sensor consists of two probes 3.2mm 
apart. Each probe is formed with an emitter fiber and two adjacent receiving fibers 
approximately 2mm apart from the emitting fiber. No light is detected as long as the 
probe is immersed in the dense emulsion phase. In case of a bubble passing by the probe, 
the light is reflected from the wall of the bubble to the receiver fibers. They found that 
this fiber optic probe underestimated the bubble fraction, probably due to the existence of 
small undetected or partially detected bubbles. 

32
 
 
Figure 2-10.  A Reflective Fiber Optic Sensor (Farag et al., 1997) 
 
Other light reflection probes detect the light reflected at the probe tip. According to 
Snell’s Law, at the interface of two homogeneous, isotropic media of different indexes of 
refraction, the following equation holds: 
)
i
sin(
n
)i
sin(
n
0
0 ⋅
=
⋅
, where n and n0 are the 
indexes of refraction of the fiber and the medium, respectively, while i and i0 are the 
angles of incidence and refraction of the light measured from the normal to the surface 
(Figure 2-11). Hence, if sin(i0) ≥ n/n0 then i ≥ 90o, all the light will be reflected at the 
interface. This is called total reflection. The difference of the refractive index between 
liquid, gas, and optical fiber ensure that the light is scattered at the probe tip when it is in 
the liquid phase and reflected when it is in the gas (bubble) phase. For example, for a 
glass probe tip with an index of refraction of n0=1.62, a total probe tip angle of 90o, and 
light rays parallel to the axis (i0=45o) (Figure 2-11), the light rays will be reflected back if 
n<1.15, and will be refracted if n>1.15. By detecting the reflected light, a probe operating 
on this principle enables the distinction of the gas and liquid phases present at the probe 
tip if ng<1.15<nl. Light reflection probes usually consist of optical fibers bent into a U-
shape to create the tip, or, alternatively, the ends of the fibers are cut, sealed, and finished 
into a conical tip. 
 

33
 
 
Figure 2-11.  Schematic of the Snell’s Law (Abuaf et al., 1978) 
 
It was found that the presence of a liquid film on the sensor tip reduces the effectiveness 
of a conductivity probe but not that of an optical probe. Hence, the wettability of the 
liquid phase with the glass optical fiber does not affect the sensitivity of optical probes 
very much (Frijlink, 1987). This is one of the advantages of optical fiber probes over 
conductivity probes. As illustrated in Figure 2-12, the light ray ‘a’ experiences total 
reflection at the glass-gas interface, i.e., sin(i) ≥ ngas/nglass. With a liquid film present, 
refraction to the liquid will take place, and the ray will arrive at the liquid-gas interface 
with angle of incidence i’. In the case of flat parallel surfaces it is easily shown that the 
condition of total reflection is now fulfilled at the liquid-gas interface:

It may be said that the critical angle where the total reflection happens is transformed to 
the liquid-gas interface simply by Snell’s law. With a curved surface, similar arguments 
can be used because the film thickness is very small compared to the fiber tip’s radius of 
curvature, so that the local region of surface where the reflection happens can be treated 
as flat.

The optical fiber probes used by Abuaf, Jones and Zimmer (1978) and Vince et al. (1982) 
to determine the local void fraction in bubble columns had tips that were terminated as a 
cone with a 90o apex angle (Figure 2-13). The probe in Figure 2-13 consists of two fibers 
(125 µm in diameter each), which were fused together at the end. The tip of the probe 
containing the fused ends of the fibers was ground and polished at a 45o angle to the axes 
of the fibers, thus forming an apex angle of 90o.

Yu and Kim (1988) used a two-point light reflection probe, whose active elements were 
made by bending an optical fiber into a U-shape (Figure 2-14), to determine the gas 
holdup, mean velocity, and mean bubble chord length in a three-phase fluidized bed.

Chabot et al. (1992) used a spherical bulb dual optical fiber probe (Figure 2-15) for 
bubble characterization in a bubble column and a slurry bubble column at high 
temperature. According to their research results, no bubble was observed to be 
significantly affected by the probes, in spite of a decrease in the bubble velocity that was 
important for small bubbles (for example, 2 mm diameter bubbles in oil). This is because 
small bubbles did not have enough inertia to be pierced by the tips of optical probes, but 
rather grazed the probes’ tip while being slightly deflected.

Saberi et al. (1995) made a two-point optical probe by cutting the tip of the fibers into a 
wedge with a 30o angle. Its flat polished surface was aligned with the flow. This probe 
was used to measure bubble behavior in a pilot scale column with a diameter of 0.15m 
and height of 2.3m. It was said that the probe produced results that are of acceptable 
accuracy for practical calculations.

Cartellier (1998) developed a monofiber probe that can measure the bubble chord length 
and bubble rise velocity. This monofiber probe has a tip form of a cone + a cylinder + a 
cone (Figure 2-16). This complicated probe tip was made by etching. This monofiber 
probe was a successful miniature of a two-point probe, i.e., it combined two tips onto one 
single optical fiber. The application of the monofiber probe in bubbly flow showed that it 
is comparable to a two-point probe.

bubble properties in multiphase systems.

3.1  Analysis of Measurement Errors for Two-Point Probes 
 
As mentioned earlier, probes are the only means that can be applied in practical bubble 
columns to study bubble behavior, e.g., bubble velocity and bubble chord length. Two-
point probes have been employed in most of the reported studies (Choi and Lee, 1990; 
Chabot et al., 1992; Wu and Ishii, 1999; Fan et al., 1999; Magaud et al., 2001). Lim and 
Agarwal (1992) analyzed the errors in bubble velocity and bubble chord length obtained 
by two-point probes, based on the assumption of spherical bubbles. They found that the 
relative error in the bubble velocity obtained by two-point probes varied with the 
incidence angle and the position at which the bubble hits the probe. The error can easily 
be over 100% in many cases. Hence, they concluded that values of both bubble velocity 
and bubble chord length obtained by a two-point probe are theoretically questionable, and 
experimental results reported using these probes must be viewed at best as qualitative. 
However, their analysis is limited to spherical bubbles only, and did not consider the 
curvature correction. Since most bubbles in bubble columns are approximately 
ellipsoidal, the case of ellipsoidal bubbles is analyzed in this work, and a curvature 
correction is included in the error analysis. It is thus quantitatively shown that 
measurements of bubble velocity and bubble chord length by two-point probes can be 
highly inaccurate. To analyze the measurement errors of two-point probes, the following 
assumptions are made (refer to Figure 3-1): 
 
(1) The bubble velocity vector aligns with the bubble orientation. In other words, the 
bubble has a symmetry plane (e.g., spherical or ellipsoidal bubbles) that is perpendicular 
to the bubble velocity vector. 

39
 
 
(2) The shape fluctuation and deformation of the bubble caused by its interaction with the 
probe are neglected. 
 
(3) The bubble velocity vector (magnitude and direction) does not change during the 
bubble’s passage past the probe. 
 
With these assumptions, the time interval, ∆t, between the time when the leading edge of 
a bubble hits Tip0, the longer tip of a two-point probe (Figure 3-1a), and the time when it 
hits Tip1, the shorter tip of a two-point probe (refer to Figure 3-1b), is:

(3-1) 
 
where v is the magnitude of the bubble velocity vector, and θ is the angle between the 
bubble velocity vector and the probe’s axial direction (Figure 3-1a). 
 
A closer examination reveals that Equation (3-1) is not accurate because the curvature of 
the bubble’s leading edge is neglected. In fact, the effect of curvature on measurements 
by two-point probes was neglected in most of the published studies (Choi and Lee, 1990; 
Chabot et al., 1992; Wu and Ishii, 1999; Fan et al., 1999; Magaud et al., 2001). This 
simplification strongly suggests an even larger error range for two-point probe 
measurements. To obtain the velocity of a bubble, the displacement of the bubble’s 
centroid, instead of that of the bubble’s leading edge, needs to be known. The centroid of 
an ellipsoidal bubble is on the plane formed by the major axes of the bubble, i.e., plane 
AB in Figure 3-1a.

The magnitude of the vertical component of the bubble velocity vector with an angle θ to 
the vertical direction is then customarily obtained as (Korekazu et al., 1980; Lim and

The relative errors predicted by Equation (3-5) are shown in Figure 3-3a. The errors are 
always nonnegative, i.e., the magnitude of the bubble vertical velocity obtained by two-
point probes is always larger than the real value. The value of the error increases with the 
value of angle θ: it can be as large as 100% at θ = 45o, and it goes to infinity at θ = 90o. 
 
Using a typical algorithm for two-point probes, the bubble chord length is obtained by the 
product of the bubble vertical velocity and the time interval that the probe tip spends in 
the bubble. Hence, the error in the bubble velocity is transferred to the bubble chord 
length. The equation to obtain the chord length pierced by Tip0 is:

obtained by a two-point probe. Actually L0/cosθ represents the length CE in Figure 3-1a, 
while the real chord length pierced by Tip0, L0, is the length CD. 
 
Then the relative error in the bubble chord length pierced by Tip0 is:

As shown in Figure 3-3b, this error is also always positive, i.e., the bubble chord length 
obtained by two-point probes is always larger than the real chord length pierced by the 
probe tip. The error increases with the value of angle θ, and it can be as great as 40% at θ 
= 45o. 
 
The above analysis indicates that measurements of bubble velocity and bubble chord 
length by two-point probes are subject to large errors. Reasonably accurate measurements 
are possible only for very small value of angle θ, i.e., for small departures of the bubble 

43
 
velocity vector from the probe’s axial direction (usually vertical direction). Hence, two-
point probes can be used only in the situations where all bubbles move strictly in one 
direction, such as in forced cocurrent gas liquid flow in pipes, and are not suitable for 
systems having complex hydrodynamics, such as bubble columns. New probes and 
algorithms need to be designed to obtain these important parameters in bubble column 
flows. 
 
It can be seen from Figure 3-3 that when θ = 0o, i.e., when the bubble velocity vector is 
aligned with the probe’s axial direction, the relative errors in the bubble velocity and 
bubble chord length measurements by two point probes are zero. Hence, the four-point 
probe was originally developed to remove the errors in measurements by two-point 
probes by distinguishing and measuring only bubbles that move in the probe’s axial 
direction, as explained in Section 3.2.

3.2 The Configuration and Principle of the Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
3.2.1  The Configuration of the Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
Four-point glass optical probes, developed by Frijlink (1987) and his colleagues at the 
University of Delft in the Netherlands, are used in this research. The optical fiber used is 
FP-200-UHT multimode fiber optic produced by 3M Corporation. It consists of three 
layers: a quartz glass core, a silicon cladding, and a protective layer of Teflon (core 
diameter 200±5µm, clad diameter 380±20µm, outside diameter 600±30µm). 
 
The configuration of the four-point probe is shown in Figure 3-4. At one end of the 
optical fibers, the cladding and Teflon layer are removed, and the tip of the glass core is 
shaped into a cone or semi-sphere, like that shown in Figure 3-4e, with a hydrogen flame. 
This shape assures that, according to the Snell’s Law (refer to Section 2.2), most light is 
reflected at the fiber tip when the probe is in gas phase, due to the difference in the 

45
 
refractive index between the glass, the liquid phase and the gas phase. Three of the four 
tips of the probe are of the same length and form an equilateral triangle. The fourth, 
central tip is positioned through the inertial center of this triangle, and is about 2.0 mm 
longer than the others. The radial distance from the central fiber to each of the others that 
surround it is about 0.6 mm. Hence, the diameter of the four-point probe is about 1.2 mm.

Figure 3-4.  Configuration of the Four-Point Optical Probe  
 
A jig, illustrated in Figure 3-5, was used to position the four fibers with appropriate tips 
together in the configuration shown in Figure 3-4. After being positioned, the four fibers 
were glued together. The procedure is to insert the four fibers into the holes of the jig, 
adjust the axial distance between the tips, and put glue on the fibers while being careful 
that the glue does not contact the glass core of the fiber (or else the probe may not work 
properly). After the solidification of the glue, the probe is removed from the jig. Because 
the glass fiber is very fragile, one needs to be very careful with this operation.

The four optical fibers of the probe are fitted into a stainless steel tube of 3.0mm outer 
diameter. The tube is bent at the end at an angle of 90o (Figure 3-6). The end of the 
tubing where the probe tip protrudes is sealed by epoxy glue. The probe is fitted to the 
measuring ports on the column wall with an appropriate connector. The horizontal part of 
the tubing is long enough to ensure that it can be traversed over the column diameter so 
that the radial profile of bubble properties can be obtained. The probe is usually aligned 
vertically, and the tip faces downwards (Figure 3-6). The four-point optical probe made 
in this configuration can be used at high pressures and at temperatures up to that the glass 
fiber and the glue used can stand (up to 500°C). The whole assembly can be used in 
water, electrolytic solutions, and organic systems. These media and operating conditions 
cover most applications of the multiphase systems employed in industry. 
 
The optical fiber probe is connected to an electronic unit developed by Kramers 
Laboratory at the University of Delft. This electronic unit generates laser beams, sends 
them into the optical fibers of the probe, and receives and transforms the light signals 
reflected from the probe tip into voltage, using photoelectric multipliers. The voltage 
signals are sent to the Data Acquisition Board (PowerDAQ PD2-MFS-8-1M/12) in the 
computer to be saved as data files. To assure the accuracy of measurements, the sampling 
frequency employed is usually 40 kHz, a value which had proved successful in the work 
of Frijilink (1987).

3.2.2  Working Principle of the Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
A laser beam (680nm wavelength) from a Light Emitting Diode (LED) is sent into the 
end of the optical fibers, and then transmitted along the fibers into the tips. If the tip of an 
optical fiber is in the liquid phase (water in this research), most of the light will enter the 
liquid phase, due to the relatively small difference in the refractive index between the 
fiber material (silica glass) and the liquid phase. If, on the other hand, the tip of an optical 
fiber is in a bubble, most of the light will be reflected back into the fiber at the tip, as 
detailed in Section 2.2. 
 
A Y-shape splitter, shown in Figure 3-7, is used to separate the reflected light from the 
incoming light. The reflected light signals are converted to voltage signals by 
photoelectric multipliers. 
 
 

49
 
 
Figure 3-7.  The Schematic of the Light Splitter 
 
The voltage output is high when the probe tip is in the gas (bubble) phase, and is low 
when it is in the liquid phase. The response of the four-point optical probe, as illustrated 
in Figure 3-8, consists of four time series for the four tips of the probe’s four optical 
fibers. As can be seen from Figure 3-8, when a bubble hits a fiber tip, the output voltage 
of that fiber rises from the baseline (liquid phase response) as more and more of the tip 
surface enters the bubble and reflects light. When the tip is completely inside the bubble 
the output is constant. As shown in Figure 3-8, this response increase is very fast. When 
the tip finally touches the bubble-water surface at the bottom of the bubble, the output 
voltage decreases to the baseline. This decrease is even much faster than the increase in 
the output voltage during the probe’s initial piercing of a bubble because the surface 
tension will cause the bubble bottom to move upwards quickly along the fiber. 
 
If a bubble traveling upwards hits the four-point probe, the central fiber, Tip0, which is a 
little longer than the others, responds first, and the other three tips (tips 1,2,3) respond a 
little later. For an axially symmetric bubble, e.g., an ellipsoidal bubble, requiring that the 
responses of tips 1, 2, 3 be almost simultaneous assures that: (1) the bubble moves in the 
probe’s axial direction, and (2) the probe hits the center of the bubble, i.e., the trajectory 
of the central tip through the bubble is along the bubble’s minor axis (Frijlink, 1987). If 
the bubble is pierced too much on the side, or the bubble does not move in the probe’s 
axial direction, the responses of the three tips 1, 2, 3 will not be simultaneous, due to the 
curvature of the bubble surface.

Figure 3-8.  Response of the Four-Point Probe to a Bubble Pierced Through 
 
Hence, by analyzing the output of the four-point optical fiber probe, one can distinguish 
and reject both bubbles that do not approach the probe in the probe’s axial direction and 
bubbles that are not pierced by the probe in the center. In practice, a tolerance is set to 
accept bubbles being pierced in the vicinity of the central line. Hence, the four-point 
probe can measure the bubble velocity more accurately than two-point probes because 
only bubbles moving in a small range of angle θ close to zero, i.e., bubbles whose motion 
deviate little from the probe’s axial direction, are measured. Hence, the theoretical error 
in the bubble velocity and bubble chord length obtained by the four-point probe is small, 
as evident from Figure 3-3 and the discussions in Section 3.1. Furthermore, the length of 
the bubble’s minor axis can be obtained directly and more accurately by avoiding the 
transfer of the bubble chord length distribution measured by the probe to the bubble size 
distribution, as needs to be done in measurements by two-point probes (Liu, Clark and 
Karamavruc, 1996, 1998) which is subject to large error. This is also one of the 
advantages of the four-point optical probe over two-point probes. However, the 
disadvantage of the four-point optical probe, as used in the study of Frijlink (1987), is 
that in complex flow patterns only a very small fraction of bubbles will hit the probe 
centrally and rise in the probe’s axial direction. Thus, it is uncertain that the obtained 
measurement reflects the bubble population that is present. This will be corrected in our 

51
 
work as shown later. The diameter of the four-point probe is 1.2mm. Thus, theoretically 
the four-point probe can measure only bubbles whose diameter in the plane perpendicular 
to the probe direction is greater than 1.2mm. There is no upper limit to the bubble size 
that can be measured by this probe. 
 
3.2.3  Signal Analysis 
 
The four-point optical probe provides four time series for the detected voltage at the tips, 
si(t) i=0,1,2,3 (Figure 3-9). The procedure for data processing is explained below.

First, the time series are transferred to the binary mode via an appropriate threshold (th). 
Different threshold is used for the extraction of bubble velocity, bubble chord length and 
local gas holdup. The threshold used for the calculation of bubble velocity is 60% of the 
difference between the baseline voltage and the peak value for bubbles. Thus, the 
response points where the output of the probe increases 60% of the difference between 
the baseline and the peak value are marked as the border of bubbles (Figure 3-10). As 

52
 
shown in Figure 3-10, this threshold can discard the irregular responses caused by a 
bubble that slips away from the probe instead of being pierced through. These irregular 
peaks are difficult to define, and may cause errors in measurements. With this threshold, 
the responses of the probe are transferred to a binary series, in which the value 1 
represents that the probe’s tip is in the bubble, and the value 0 represents that the tip is in 
the liquid phase.

The value of the threshold does not affect much the obtained value of the bubble velocity, 
since the bubble velocity is determined by the time difference between the responses of 
different fiber tips to a bubble, and the effect of different threshold values is minimized 
during the subtraction. 
 
However, the 60% threshold is too high for determination of the bubble chord length, 
because the width of the bubble peak decreases with its height (Figure 3-10), and the 
width at the peak root represents the bubble chord length pierced by the probe tip. Hence, 
a threshold of 1% is used to determine the bubble chord length, i.e. the response points 
where the output of the probe increases 1% of the difference between the baseline and the 
peak value are marked as the border of bubbles to calculate the bubble chord length 
(Figure 3-10).

where N is the total number of sample points in the response of the probe’s central tip. 
When calculating the local gas holdup, all bubbles that hit the central tip of the probe are 
used, i.e., there is no rejection of any bubbles. 
 
The threshold for the determination of gas holdup should not be too high, as this would 
cause bubbles that touch the tip rather than being pierced to be filtered out, thus 
underestimating the gas holdup. Obviously, it cannot be too close to zero either, as then 
unwanted noise would cause an overestimate of the gas holdup. By using various 
threshold values, th, and calculating the gas holdup, εg, the relationship between εg and th 
can be obtained, as shown in Figure 3-11 (as mentioned before, the unit of the threshold, 
th, is the percentage of the difference between the baseline voltage and the peak value for 
bubbles in Figure 3-11). Hence, a minimum threshold can be found, below which noise is 

54
 
influencing the void fraction estimate. The signal to noise ratio is a little different for 
each measurement by the optical probe. Hence, this procedure is repeated to find the 
suitable th for each measurement. In this study, it was found that the suitable threshold is 
usually less than 0.5%. This very low value of the threshold is due to the high 
signal/noise ratio of the optical probe, which is much better than that of electrical 
conductivity probes.

A data processing algorithm for the four-point optical probe was developed by Frijilink 
(1987) and his colleagues to get the bubble velocity and bubble chord length. This 
algorithm ensures that all bubbles that do not fit the selected criterion, i.e., that do not 
move in the probe’s axial direction and are not being pierced centrally (Figure 3-12b), are 
rejected. First, the instants when a bubble hits a probe tip i, ti, are determined, and the 
time intervals ∆ti, i=1,2,3, are calculated:

For an axially symmetric bubble moving approximately in the probe’s axial direction and 
being pierced centrally, the differences between ∆ti, i=1,2,3, should be very small (Figure 
3-12a). Hence, the next step is to evaluate whether the differences in the bubble velocities 
calculated from these three time intervals are less than a given tolerance δv (for example 
10%). If the maximum difference between these three velocities and the mean of them is 
greater than δv, then this particular bubble is discarded. Otherwise, the bubble velocity is 
obtained as the mean of the three values:

3.2.4  Measurement Errors of the Four-Point Optical Probe (Old Algorithm) 
 
According to the data processing algorithm described in Section 3.2.3, the four-point 
probe used in this work measures only bubbles that move almost in the probe’s axial 
direction and are being pierced in the vicinity of the bubble’s central line by the central 
tip of the probe. However, the movement of bubbles in bubble columns is rather 
complicated. Actually bubbles do not move vertically and straight, but rather in a zigzag 
or spiral pattern. Hence, if the probe is installed vertically in bubble columns, most 
bubbles will move in directions that deviate from the probe’s axial direction, i.e., the 
vertical direction. 
 
Of course, it is not necessary that the probe be installed vertically. To reduce the 
deviation of the bubble motion from the probe’s axial direction, it would be desirable to 
place the probe in the direction of the motion of most bubbles, if such exists, at each 
point in bubble columns. Unfortunately, it has been found that bubble motion in bubble 
columns, including the movement direction, keeps changing with the liquid flow 
direction all the time. There is no fixed preferred flow direction at most places in bubble 
columns (Chen, Reese and Fan, 1994). As a result, it is practically impossible to align the 
probe with the flow direction of bubbles, and many bubbles rise with a velocity direction 
that deviates from the probe’s axial direction. Furthermore, the position where the probe 
hits the bubble’s leading edge is random. Hence, the selection function of the probe is 
difficult to apply efficiently. For example, in a 2-D column used, the bubble selection 
with this probe (with tolerance δv=10%, see Equation 3-11) caused more than 99% of 
bubbles that hit the probe to be discarded. This high selectivity causes difficulty in data 
processing and interpretation. Therefore, to avoid a high discard ratio of bubbles during 
the measurements, the effect of increasing the tolerance δv was studied so that bubbles 
with movement that does deviate somewhat from the probe’s axial direction are also 
accepted. To do this in a systematic manner, an error analysis was performed.

Figure 3-15 shows the errors in measurements by the probe predicted by Equation (3-17). 
The range of angle ϕ is selected as 0~60o. This range covers all the cases because of the 
symmetry of the three peripheral tips of the probe. The range of angle θ is selected also 
as 0~60o for the convenience of display. In this range of θ and ϕ, the relative error in the 
magnitude of the bubble velocity component in the probe’s axial direction can be as large 
as 400%. At θ values larger than 60o, the relative errors are even larger. It can be seen 
from Figure 3-15 that the relative error is affected mainly by the value of angle θ. To 
keep the relative error smaller than 25%, θ must be smaller than 25o. 
 
Figures 3-16, 3-17, and 3-18 show the difference between the bubble velocity determined 
by Tip i, vi i=1,2,3, and the mean of v1, v2, and v3. Assume the tolerance, δv, for the 
bubble selection is set to be 10%, i.e., a bubble will be accepted only if the relative 
differences between v1, v2, v3 and the mean, v, are all within ±10% (refer to Equation 3-
11). From Figures 3-16, 3-17, and 3-18, it can be seen that all bubbles with a velocity 
vector that deviates from the probe’s axial direction within 20o will be accepted. The 
relative error in the bubble velocity at θ=20o is about 15% according to Figure 3-15. If 
the tolerance, δv, is set to be 20%, the tolerated range of θ by the probe measurement will 
be larger than 30o. At θ=30o, the relative error in the bubble velocity is about 40% 
according to Figure 3-15.

It should be noted that the above error analysis is based on the assumption that bubbles 
are strictly axially symmetric, e.g., ellipsoidal bubbles, or else unpredictable errors can 
arise. Moreover, the definition of an irregular bubble’s geometric center and centerline 
are meaningless. However, as we know, in bubble columns the bubbles’ shapes always 
deviate from being strictly symmetric. Even in bubbly flow, most bubbles are not axially 
symmetric, as shown in Figure 3-19, let alone in transition flow and churn-turbulent flow. 
Due to the interaction between bubbles, usually single bubbles have a more regular shape 
than bubbles in clusters. At high gas holdup most bubbles are in clusters rather than 
moving alone. Moreover, bubbles keep fluctuating during movement, and the interaction 
of the bubble with the probe tip deforms the bubble shape. These factors make the bubble 
shape in multiphase systems, e.g., bubble columns, very difficult to define and predict. 
Hence, it is not wise to base the algorithm on a strict assumption of axially symmetric 
bubbles.

Gas Velocity Ug=1.85 cm/s 
 

 
66
Furthermore, the bubble selection function of this four-point optical probe needs the 
configuration of the probe tip to be exactly the same as that shown in Figure 3-4, i.e., 
three of the four tips of the probe must be of the same length and form an equilateral 
triangle. The fourth, central tip is positioned through the inertial center of this triangle. 
Due to the error in the fiber tip positioning and the stress arising during the gluing 
process, it is very difficult to satisfy this requirement precisely during the production of 
the four-point probe. In this study, most probes deviated somewhat from such exact 
configuration. When the three peripheral tips are not of the same length, the difference 
can be compensated for by measuring the distances of tips, 1, 2, and 3, from the central 
tip. However, by the use of the old algorithm, any deviation of the probe’s four tips from 
the desired horizontal configuration, i.e. the central tip being positioned through the 
inertial center of the equilateral triangle formed by the three peripheral tips, cannot be 
compensated for. Such a compensation would require information on the bubble shape, 
e.g., the aspect ratio and size for ellipsoidal bubbles, which are the parameters that the 
probe was designed to measure. Hence, any deviation of the real probe from the ideal 
configuration is also a source of error in the bubble velocity and bubble size obtained by 
the old algorithm for the four-point optical probe. 
 
Since the bubble chord length is obtained by the product of the bubble velocity and the 
time interval that the probe tip spends in the bubble, the error in the bubble velocity will 
be transferred to the bubble chord length obtained by the four-point probe. However, 
when the bubble velocity vector deviates from the probe’s axial direction, even if the 
magnitude of the bubble velocity can be measured accurately, the bubble chord length 
pierced by the probe’s central tip cannot be obtained correctly because the probe 
measures only the vertical component of the bubble velocity. In the case shown in Figure 
3-20, the central tip of the probe passes through the central line of the bubble. The 
magnitude of the component of the bubble velocity vector in the probe’s axial direction is 
v⋅cosθ. The time interval during which the probe’s central tip stays in the bubble is αa/v 
in this case, where a is the length of the major axis of the ellipsoidal bubble, and 
α=(length of the minor axis)/(length of the major axis) is the aspect ratio of the bubble. 

67
 
The length of the bubble’s minor axis is obtained as the product of these two values, i.e., 
αa⋅cosθ, by the existing algorithm. This value is actually the length OB in Figure 3-20, 
which is different from the length of the bubble’s minor axis OA. Actually the length OB 
is physically meaningless.

To sum up: 
 
(1) The deviation of the bubble velocity vector from the probe’s axial direction can cause 
errors in the bubble velocity and bubble size obtained by the four-point optical probe. 
Although the bubble selection criterion δv in Equation (3-11b) can ensure that bubbles 
whose velocity vectors deviate significantly from the probe’s axial direction are 
discarded, thus reducing the magnitude of the errors caused by the deviation of the 
bubble velocity vector from the probe’s axial direction, the application of this four-point 
probe in bubble columns is still not satisfactory. 
 
(2) The original algorithm requires the bubble shape to be axially symmetric, which is far 
from the physical reality in bubble columns, especially in the transition and churn-
turbulent flow regime. 

 
68
 
(3) It is technically difficult to configure the probe tips accurately as required by the old 
algorithm. 
 
(4) As a result of the bubble selection function of the four-point probe, only a small 
percentage of bubbles are measured by the probe. By selecting bubbles that hit the probe, 
a specific population of bubbles (e.g., bubbles moving in the probe’s axial direction) in 
bubble columns is used to determine the bubble velocity and size distribution, instead of 
the whole bubble population. However, there is no firm theoretical or experimental proof 
which assures that the velocity and size of the whole bubble population are similar to that 
of this specific bubble population. Most likely, they are not similar. 
 
To solve the problems described above, an appropriate modification of the data 
processing algorithm of the four-point probe is developed. This modification is described 
in the next section. 
 
3.3  New Data Processing Algorithm for the Four-Point Probe 
 
A new data processing algorithm capable of determining both the magnitude and the 
direction of the bubble velocity vector is proposed and developed. Moreover, the specific 
interfacial area now can also be determined directly from the probe’s response. 
 
To determine the bubble velocity vector, its magnitude, v, and direction angles, θ and ϕ 
(refer to Figure 3-21b), need to be measured. Hence, three equations including these three 
variables are needed to obtain the bubble velocity vector. If a four-point probe is 
considered as being comprised of three two-point probes in different directions (Figure 3-
21a), the responses of the three two-point probes that comprise a four-point probe provide 
these three needed equations. 
 

69
 
Figure 3-21b shows the geometry when a bubble hits the probe at an angle θ to the 
probe’s axial direction. Assume that the bubble is ellipsoidal and the bubble velocity 
vector is perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the bubble (the plane formed by the 
major axes of the bubble). To set up the equations that describe the physical situation, the 
coordinate transformation shown in Figure 3-14 is made. The xyz coordinate system is 
transformed to x’y’z’ system with its z’-axis in the direction of the bubble velocity 
vector. The relationship between coordinates x’, y’, z’ and x, y, z is explained in Equation 
(3-13). After this coordinate transformation, the z’ coordinates of the four probe tips are:

equations need to be solved numerically, e.g., with a Newton-Raphson algorithm. As a 
result, the velocity magnitude, v, and the direction angles, θ and ϕ, of the bubble velocity 
vector are obtained. Based on these values, the bubble chord length pierced by Tip i, Li, 
i=0, 1, 2, 3, can be obtained by:

The chord length distribution obtained by the probe then needs to be transformed to the 
‘equivalent’ bubble diameter distribution. Liu et al. (1996, 1998) developed an algorithm 
to transform the bubble chord length distribution obtained by a two-point probe to the 
bubble size distribution when bubbles are spherical, ellipsoidal or truncated ellipsoidal. 
To use this algorithm, the aspect ratio of the bubbles, α=(length of minor axis)/(length of 
major axis), in the system needs to be known or assumed in advance. Usually α is 
empirically set as a single value. However, in bubble columns α is not a single value but 
a distribution, and there is no way to estimate the mean aspect ratio in advance. Hence, 
this oversimplification may cause large errors in the transformation of bubble chord 
length distribution to bubble size distribution. Besides, Liu’s algorithm is very sensitive 

71
 
to errors in the bubble chord length distribution, i.e., small changes in the bubble chord 
length distribution obtained may cause significant changes in the bubble size distribution 
calculated. Hence, Liu’s algorithm for the transfer of the bubble chord length distribution 
to the bubble diameter distribution is not really applicable to bubble columns. So far, 
there is no other reported algorithm for the transformation of the bubble chord length 
distribution to the bubble size distribution. 
 
As to the four-point optical probe, after the bubble chord lengths are obtained, 
theoretically the bubble size can be calculated based on the assumption of the bubble 
shape. The algorithm is explained below, and is valid not only for ellipsoidal bubbles but 
also for any bubble whose shape can be expressed mathematically. Assume that the 
bubble is ellipsoidal, with the minor axis as the revolution axis, as shown in Figure 3-22a. 
The equation of the ellipsoid in Figure 3-22b is 
, where α is the aspect 
ratio and c is a half of the length of the major axis. From Figure 3-22b it can be seen that 
in the above equation x is the distance between the chord pierced by the probe’s tip to the 
bubble’s center O, i.e., the length OC, and y equals half of the chord length, L

Figure 3-22.  Determination of the Bubble Size and Aspect Ratio 
 
The advantage of this transformation algorithm over the methods suggested by Liu et al. 
(1996, 1998) is that the aspect ratio of the bubble, α, can be obtained experimentally 
instead of being assumed. This is important, since as mentioned above it may cause large 
errors to set α as a single value. 
 
Unfortunately, the measurements in a 2D bubble column conducted in this study show 
that the proposed algorithm based on solution of Equations (3-20a-d) does not give an 
accurate estimate of either bubble size or aspect ratio (Appendix F). It was found that the 

73
 
algorithm always underestimates the bubble aspect ratio, and is very sensitive to changes 
of the bubble chord lengths obtained by the probe, i.e., small changes in the bubble chord 
lengths may cause large variations in the calculated bubble size and aspect ratio. In 3D 
bubble columns, the shape of bubbles deviates much more from ellipsoidal than in the 2D 
bubble column at very low gas holdup. Hence, it is expected that the error in the bubble 
sizes and aspect ratios obtained by the four-point probe will be even larger in 3D bubble 
columns. As a result, this method is not recommended to investigate the bubble size and 
shape in bubble columns. Instead, the bubble chord length distributions obtained by the 
four-point probe were used to gain information on the bubble size distribution in bubble 
columns, e.g., to determine whether the bubble size distribution in churn-turbulent flow is 
bimodal or single modal. 
 
One of the assumptions for all of the above analysis is that the bubble velocity vector 
aligns with the bubble orientation. Usually this is true, due to the balance of the forces on 
bubbles and the shape flexibility of gas bubbles. However, when the bubble’s motion 
direction changes significantly as sometimes in churn-turbulent flow, it was observed that 
the bubble velocity vector might deviate from the normal vector of the bubble’s 
symmetry plane by an angle, φ, as shown in Figure 3-23a. This deviation may cause 
errors in the bubble velocity vector and bubble chord length obtained by the four-point 
optical probe. 
 
From Figure 3-23c, it can be derived that the time intervals between the instant when a 
bubble hits the central Tip0 and when it hits Tipi, i=1,2,3 are:

where θ is the angle between the normal vector (vector n  in Figure 3-23b) of the 
bubble’s symmetry plane to the probe’s axial direction, and ϕ is the angle between the 
projection of the normal vector on the xy plane and the x axis (Figure 3-23b). As shown

Since there are only three equations (equations 3-22a, 3-22b, 3-22c) for four variables, 
i.e., v, θ, ϕ and φ, what can be obtained is θ, ϕ and 
φ

 instead of v and φ separately. 
Correspondingly, the chord length obtained by the probe is

bubble’s surface, A, is AC, but

 is actually the length AD. Hence, in the case 
where the bubble velocity vector does not align with the bubble’s orientation, the 
determined bubble velocity vector and bubble chord length contain a systematic error. 
However, the error is small when the value of φ is small. 
 
Lim and Agarwal (1992) found that in a 2-D fluidized bed φ had a normal distribution 
with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 14o. This fact implies that the bubble 
velocity aligns with the bubble orientation with a small variation. Since cos(14o)=0.97, 
the standard deviation of 14o implies that the error in the bubble velocity due to φ is 
small. Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) adopted an upper limit of 10o~22o for φ under 
different operating conditions in air-water bubbly and slug flow in a vertical tube of inner 
diameter of 6 cm. At φ=22o, cosφ=0.927. Hence, it is expected that the error in the bubble 
velocity magnitude due to the deviation of the bubble velocity vector from the bubble 
orientation is small, and the bubble velocity vector and bubble chord length obtained by 
Equation (3-18) and (3-19) are reliable. Coincidentally, Equation (3-22) provides a way 
to calculate the specific interfacial area as explained below.  
 
Kataoka, Ishii and Serizawa (1986) derived the equation for the specific interfacial area, 
a, in gas-liquid  systems as:

where N is the total number of the gas-liquid interfaces passing by the probe during the 
measurement time ∆T, and φ is the angle between the velocity vector and the normal 
vector of the gas-liquid interface (e.g., the bubble’s surface). 
 
Based on Equation (3-23), the four-point optical probe can be employed to obtain the 
specific interfacial area. The physical situation is shown in Figure 3-24. Assume that the 
gas-liquid interface (bubble surface) section between the three tips, Tip1, Tip2 and Tip3, 
of the probe (Figure 3-24a) is flat. Considering the small size of the probe tip (1.2 mm in 
diameter), this is a reasonable assumption except when the probe hits a gas-liquid 
interface with large curvature, e.g., bubbles of very small horizontal dimension. 
 
Note that the bubble leading edges and trailing edges both should be accounted for in the 
specific interfacial area, and the curvature correction mentioned above (Figure 3-2) is 
unnecessary (that curvature correction is valid only for measurements of the velocity of 
the bubble’s centroid instead of the velocity of the bubble surface section).

By solving these three equations numerically, the value of 
φ

 can be obtained, 
which can then be used to obtain the specific interfacial area from Equation (3-23). 
However, if a bubble hits the central tip of the probe but misses some of the three 
peripheral tips, then the bubble surface velocity vector cannot be obtained, due to the 
insufficient number of equations, although this bubble contributes to the specific 
interfacial area at the probe’s central tip. To account for the contribution of these 
“missed” bubbles, the average value of 
φ
⋅cos
v
 of bubbles that pass all the four tips of 
the probe will be assigned to these “missed” bubbles. Hence, the equation for the 
calculation of specific interfacial area is:

Equations (3-24) and (3-25) do not need assumptions about bubble shape. Thus, errors 
due to the inaccuracy in the bubble shape assumption can be avoided, leading to a robust 
algorithm. 
 
In churn-turbulent flow, the shape of many bubbles is highly irregular, and cannot be 
described as any simple geometric shape, especially for large bubbles. Nevertheless, the 
Sauter mean bubble diameter (the volume-surface mean diameter of bubbles) as shown in 

 
78
Equation (2-2) is widely employed to describe the bubble size. To obtain the Sauter mean 
diameter, bubbles’ volumes need to be measured. However, it is impossible to obtain the 
bubble volume accurately with the current techniques. Hence, another way is needed to 
derive the Sauter mean diameter. 
 
With the simplification of assuming spherical bubbles, the gas-liquid interfacial area can 
be related to the gas holdup, εg, and the Sauter mean diameter, ds, as given by Equation 
(2-1). With the local specific interfacial area and gas holdup obtained by the four-point 
probe, the Sauter mean bubble diameter at different positions in bubble columns can be 
calculated by Equation (2-1). However, this should be treated only as a rough estimate of 
bubble size. 
 
In conclusion, the advantages of this new data processing algorithm over the old one are: 
 
(1) Both the magnitude and the direction of the bubble velocity vector can be obtained. 
 
(2) The probe does not need to be aligned with the flow direction at different positions to 
ensure the accuracy of measurements. 
 
(3) There is no selection of bubbles that hit the probe moving in the probe’s axial 
direction. Hence the whole bubble population in bubble columns is used to determine the 
bubble velocity distribution and bubble chord length distribution, instead of just a 
specific population of bubbles (e.g., bubbles moving in the probe’s axial direction). 
 
(4) The specific interfacial area can be obtained in a simple way. 
 
(5) Sauter mean bubble diameter can be reported based on sphericity assumption.

Chapter 4  Validation of Measurements by the 
Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
There are many additional factors, not previously discussed, that affect the measurements 
of bubble properties by the four-point optical probe in multiphase systems. For example, 
when a bubble hits a probe tip, the interaction between the probe tip and the bubble dents 
the bubble’s leading edge. The extent of the interaction and the dent depend on the 
physical properties of the liquid phase (surface tension, viscosity, polarity, and density), 
the properties of the probe (material, size, shape), the bubble velocity, and the bubble 
size. Hence, before the probe can be applied in actual bubble columns the probe 
measurements of bubble velocity distribution, bubble chord length distribution, local gas 
holdup, and specific interfacial area must be validated. 
 
The validation of the probe is accomplished by comparing the local gas holdup, bubble 
velocity, and specific interfacial area obtained by the probe with those obtained by CCD 
cameras in the validation setups, e.g., a 2D bubble column. The measurements by the 
camera are believed to be accurate under these simple conditions. This chapter presents 
the validation results for the four-point optical probe in an air-water system. Since the 
deformation of bubbles when they hit the probe also depends on the physical properties 
of the liquid phase, it may be necessary to revalidate the probe specifically in liquids 
whose physical properties are very different from water, e.g., some organic systems. 
 
4.1  Validation of the Bubble Velocity Vector 
 
Two CCD cameras were employed to perform the video imaging analysis. The CA-D6-
0256ECEW camera by DALSA provides a resolution of 260×260 pixels and a very high 
frame rate up to 955 frames per second (fps). The CA-D6-0256W camera provides a 
better resolution of 532×516 pixels and a frame rate up to 262 fps. The frame grabber and 

 
80
the imaging processing software used are the PIXCI D32 and XCAP by EPIX, 
respectively. Two setups were used to validate the bubble velocity obtained by the four-
point optical probe. Figure 4-1 shows the first experimental setup, in which a bubble train 
is generated via a capillary that is placed at the bottom of a rectangular container filled 
with tap water. The optical probe is placed about 2 cm above the capillary exit where 
bubbles move vertically (i.e., bubble wobbling has not caused too much deviation from a 
vertical trajectory). The probe tip is horizontally positioned at the center of the bubble 
train so that the central tip of the probe pierces the bubble in the direction of the minor 
axis (Figure 4-2). The bubbles’ hitting the probe tip are filmed from the side (Figure 4-1). 
The velocity of bubbles in the same bubble train is almost identical. By using capillaries 
of different diameter, bubbles of different velocities and sizes can be generated.

Figure 4-1.  The Calibration Setup 
 
A series of images that illustrate the process of a bubble approaching and hitting the 
probe tip are shown in Figure 4-2. In this case the vertical velocity of bubbles is 24.6 
cm/s, and the horizontal and vertical dimensions are 2.0 mm and 5.7mm, respectively. It 
can be seen that the bubble shape fluctuated greatly during its ascendance. Although it is 
hard to distinguish the bubble shape fluctuation and the deformation caused by the 
interaction with the probe tip, it can be estimated that the extent of the deformation due to 
the probe is much smaller than the natural bubble shape fluctuation.

Figure 4-2.  Bubble Hits the Probe Tip (field of view 1.3cm×1.3cm) 
 
It was confirmed by video imaging that there was no obvious change in the bubble 
velocity in this single bubble train case when a bubble was pierced by the probe tip in the 
range of bubble velocities and bubble sizes studied (22.1~27.4 cm/s and 2.6~3.1 mm in 
volume equivalent diameter, respectively). This is illustrated in Figure 4-3. The same 
conclusion was reached by Mudde and Saito (2001).

83
As shown in Figure 4-4, it was found that the bubble velocity and chord length obtained 
by the four-point probe were always smaller than those obtained by the camera. This is 
possibly due to the deformation of the bubble leading edge by the probe tip, since it has 
been shown that hitting the probe tip does not slow down the bubble. The relative errors 
in the bubble velocity and chord length obtained by the four-point probe are within –10% 
in the range of bubble velocity and bubble size studied (i.e., 22.1~27.4 cm/s and 2.6~3.1 
mm in volume equivalent diameter, respectively). Hence, the bubble velocity and bubble 
chord length obtained by the four-point probe are reliable in this single bubble train case. 
 
The single bubble train case, as described above, is quite simple compared to the situation 
in bubble columns. Hence, the validation of the bubble velocity and specific interfacial 
area obtained by the four-point optical probe were also conducted in a transparent 2D 
bubble column. The configuration of this second setup was shown in Figure 4-5. The 
dimensions of the 2D bubble column are 181.5(h)×49.0(w)×1.3(d) cm. The gas 
distributor has 16 holes with diameter of 1.0 mm, evenly distributed in a line. The probe 
was positioned in the centerline of the column, 96.8 cm above the distributor. When 
validating the probe, in most cases a bubble stream was generated in the 2D bubble 
column using a single gas nozzle instead of the gas distributor. The single gas nozzle was 
introduced into the bubble column through a connector, and was about 57 cm below the 
four-point probe tip (refer to Figure 4-5). 
 
The reasons for using the single gas nozzle to generate bubbles instead of the gas 
distributor are: 
 
(1) The imaging analysis software can recognize only a portion of the total bubbles and 
measure their velocity in 2D bubble columns. This is because bubbles of larger velocity 
tend to form clusters that cannot be recognized by the imaging processing software due to 
the overlap, coalescence, and dispersion of bubbles. Hence, bubbles that move in clusters, 
which are of higher velocity, cannot be distinguished separately by the imaging 
processing software and were not measured. This omission causes errors in the bubble 

 
84
velocity distribution and mean bubble velocity obtained by the camera. Hence, the 
imaging method can be applied only at very low gas velocity, in which case the gas 
holdup is very low and bubbles are sparse. However, at very low gas velocity bubbles 
were generated at only a portion of the holes on the gas distributor, and the generation of 
bubbles usually is not continuous. 
 
(2) Bubbles of different sizes can be generated using gas nozzles of different sizes so that 
the probe validation can cover a range of bubble size and velocity. This is impossible 
using the gas distributor.

Figure 4-5.  Setup of the 2D Bubble Column for the Probe Validation 
 
In this 2D bubble column, the bubble velocity distribution and the mean bubble velocities 
obtained by the probe and by the camera were compared, instead of comparing the 
bubble velocity of each single bubble as in the single bubble train setup (Figure 4-1). This 
approach is chosen for the following reasons: (1) Although the bubble column was said to 
be 2D, it is still 1.3cm in depth. Hence, even though the probe tip and a bubble overlap on 

 
85
the photo taken by the camera, it is possible that the bubble does not contact the probe 
tip, due to the depth of the column. One cannot distinguish this situation from real 
piercing; hence, it is difficult to correlate the individual bubble velocity obtained by the 
probe to that obtained by the camera on the one by one basis. (2) To describe the 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns, the bubble velocity distribution and mean bubble 
velocity are more valuable than the velocity of each single bubble. (3) To get the bubble 
velocity distribution, the velocity of hundreds or thousands of bubbles are needed, and it 
is too time consuming to get the bubble velocities one by one. 
 
 
Rotating bubble 
Rotating bubble 
Figure 4-6.  Rotation of Bubbles in the 2D Bubble Column 
 
Furthermore, the camera cannot measure accurately the bubble chord length pierced by 
the probe tip in the 2D bubble column for several reasons: (1) Due to the depth of the 
column, the position where the probe tip hits the bubble cannot be determined on the 
photos. Hence, the chord length pierced by the probe tip cannot be determined by image 
analysis. (2) Bubbles rotate during their movement (Figure 4-6) so that the projection of 

 
86
the bubbles on the photos does not represent their real dimension. (3) Again, it is too time 
consuming to compare the bubble chord lengths one by one. So, the bubble chord length 
obtained by the four-point probe was not validated directly by video imaging. It was 
validated indirectly as mentioned later. 
 
Hence, the local bubble velocity distribution at the central tip of the probe was measured 
by the four-point probe and by the camera, respectively, and the results were compared 
for validation. Some examples of the bubble velocity distribution obtained by these two 
methods are shown in Figure 4-7. The mean bubble velocities are listed in Table 4-1. The 
mean bubble sizes in terms of volume-equivalent diameter, obtained by the video 
imaging, are listed in the captions of the diagrams. 
 
It can be seen from Figure 4-7 that the bubble velocity distributions obtained by the probe 
in general match well with those obtained by the CCD camera. However, careful 
comparison of Figures 4-7a, 4-7b and 4-7c and the statistical parameters listed in Table 4-
1 reveals that for small bubbles the mean bubble velocity obtained by the probe is larger 
than that obtained by the camera. For large bubbles the reverse is observed, i.e., the 
relative error in the mean bubble velocity obtained by the probe changes from positive to 
negative when the bubble size increases (Table 4-1). This may be caused by the fact that 
small bubbles of low velocity (momentum) tend to slip away from the probe tip instead 
of being pierced through (Chabot et al., 1992). Large bubbles, even when their velocity is 
low, still have enough momentum to be pierced through by the probe tip. Hence, more 
small bubbles of low velocity were not detected by the four-point probe than large 
bubbles. As a result, the mean velocity for small bubbles is overestimated by the four-
point optical probe. 
 
For large bubbles, the probability density function (pdf) of the bubble velocity shifts 
toward the low value (Figure 4-7c). This is possibly because the deformation of the 
bubble surface by the piercing of the probe causes the bubble velocity obtained by the 
probe to be lower than the real value (Figure 4-17), and the deformation is more obvious 

 
87
for large bubbles than for small bubbles. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4-7b, the 
bubble velocity distribution obtained by the two-point probe has larger pdf values at both 
low velocity and high velocity. The larger pdf values at low velocity are caused by the 
fact that sometimes different bubbles hit the two tips of the two-point probe successively. 
The algorithm for the two-point probe considers this case the same as the case when the 
same bubble hits the two tips successively. Because the bubbles are sparse at low gas 
velocity, usually the time interval when two different bubbles hit the different tips of the 
probe is much larger than that when a single bubble hit the two tips successively. Hence, 
very low bubble velocities were derived in this case. It is noticed that this peak of the pdf 
at low velocity is clearly separated from the normal peak in the bubble velocity 
distribution obtained by the two-point probe (Figure 4-7b). Hence, by removing the pdf 
peak at low velocity arbitrarily, the bubble velocity distribution obtained by the two-point 
probe match that obtained by camera better. However, there is no physical rule that 
supports this removal and sometimes the peak at low velocity and the normal bubble 
velocity peak partly overlap and it is difficult to determine the criterion for the removal. 
The mean bubble velocities obtained by the two-point probe displayed in Table 4-1 are 
obtained after the removal of the pdf peak at low velocity. As shown in Figure 4-7b and 
Table 4-1, the bubble velocity distribution obtained by two-point probe has higher pdf 
values at high velocity and higher mean bubble velocity than values detected by camera 
and by the four-point probe. This confirms the previous analysis that the error in the 
bubble velocity obtained by the two-point probe is always positive (Figure 3-3a). As 
illustrated in Appendix D.2, in a 3D bubble column, the two-point probe did not generate 
reasonable bubble velocity distributions, especially at high gas velocity. Hence, it is 
experimentally established that the bubble velocity distribution obtained by two-point 
probes is not as reliable as that by the four-point probe, especially in transition and churn-
turbulent flow regime.

Figure 4-8 shows examples of the bubble direction angle distribution (angle θ in Figure 
4-8a, the angle between the bubble velocity vector, v, and the vertical direction, z), 
obtained by the probe and by the camera, respectively. It can be seen that the 
distributions by the two methods roughly agree in shape, except at small values of angle 
θ, where higher probability values were obtained by the camera. Correspondingly, the 
mean bubble direction angle obtained by the camera is smaller than that obtained by the 
four-point optical probe (Table 4-2).

These high probability values at small θ for the camera measurements are likely caused 
by the fact that the depth of the 2D bubble column is 1.3 cm, so the bubbles may have 
had a velocity component toward the depth direction, while the camera can catch only the 
projection of the bubble velocity vector (direction vector) in the yz plane, the plane 
formed by the width and height of the 2D bubble column (refer to Figure 4-9). Since the 
direction angle, θ, is always larger than or equal to its projection on the yz plane, θ’, i.e., 
θ’ ≤ θ, the bubble direction angle obtained by the camera is smaller than the real value, 
except when the bubble direction vector falls in the yz plane. This limitation results in 
high probability values at small direction angles indicated by the camera.

Experiments that cover bubbles of different sizes (mean diameter of 0.23cm ~ 2.33 cm) 
were conducted to validate the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe. 
The 2D bubble column illustrated in Figure 4-5 is not suitable for large bubbles because 
the small depth dimension (1.3 cm) makes large bubbles deform and there is also a strong 
wall effect on their movement, so that the large bubble behavior is very different from 
that in bubble columns. Hence, a transparent pipe was used to validate the velocity of 
large bubbles obtained by the four-point probe. The configuration of the Plexiglas pipe is 
shown in Figure 4-10. The pipe is 5.5 cm in the inner diameter and 105 cm in height. A 
single nozzle gas sparger was installed at the bottom of the pipe. Bubbles of different 
sizes can be generated by employing gas nozzles of different outlet sizes and by adjusting 
the gas velocity. It was proved by video imaging that in the central zone (3.0 cm in 
diameter) of the column the distortion of the imaging due to the effect of the wall 
curvature is negligible. The probe is positioned in the center of the pipe, about 98 cm 
from the bottom.

The validation results are shown in Figure 4-11. The relative errors in the mean bubble

number, Reb, (ratio of inertial force/viscous force), and bubble Eotvos number, Eob (ratio

Figure 4-11 displays the relative error in the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-
point probe at different Reb and Eob. It can be seen from Figure 4-11 that at bubble 
volume-equivalent diameter in the range of 0.23cm ~ 2.33cm (Reb=737~10500, 
Eob=0.72~73.7), the relative error in the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point 
probe is within –11% ~ +6%, and it changes from positive to negative with an increase in 
bubble size and velocity. The relative errors oscillate around –10% when Reb>4000 and 
Eob>10. Hence, the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe is reliable 
with the range of error –11% ~ +6% at the conditions employed in the validation.

Unfortunately, calibration of the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe 
in bubble columns based on Figure 4-11 is not possible. This is because the bubble 
volume-equivalent diameter, de, cannot be determined by the four-point probe. As 
described earlier, de cannot be derived from the bubble chord length obtained by the 
probe because the aspect ratio of the bubble is unknown. Hence, the bubble Reynolds 
number, Reb, and bubble Eotvos number, Eob, are not available in bubble columns. Since 
the mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe is reliable, it will be accepted 
without calibration.

4.2  Validation of the Specific Interfacial Area 
 
In the case of spherical bubbles, the relationship between the specific interfacial area and 
the bubble size distribution is simple, and can be described by (Patel, Daly and Bukur, 
1989):

In Equation (4-3), a is the specific interfacial area, εg is the gas holdup, and ds is the 
Sauter mean diameter (the average volume-surface mean diameter of bubbles) as 
described in Equation (2-2). 
 
It is well known that most bubbles are not spherical in most practical multiphase systems. 
When bubbles are not spherical, e.g., ellipsoidal, the relationship between the specific 
interfacial area and the bubble size distribution is much more complicated than Equation 
(4-3). Assume that the ellipsoidal bubble has two major axes, c, and one minor axis, b. 
The three axes of an ellipsoidal bubble are c, c, b, where c>b, and α=b/c is the aspect 
ratio of the bubble. Then the surface area of the bubble is:

Since the aspect ratios of bubbles in bubble columns are not identical, it is evident from 
Equations (4-6) and (4-7) that there is no simple correlation between mean bubble size, 
gas holdup and specific interfacial area for ellipsoidal bubbles, let alone bubbles of 
irregular shape. Furthermore, for ellipsoidal bubbles Equation (4-3) does not hold even 
when the aspect ratio of bubbles is identical.  Assuming that the size and aspect ratio of 
all bubbles in bubble columns are identical, Figure 4-12 shows the relative error in the 
specific interfacial area calculated according to Equation (4-3). It can be seen that 
Equation (4-3) always underestimates the interfacial area. The smaller the aspect ratio, 
the larger the relative error. In other words, the more the bubble shape deviates from 
spherical, the larger the relative error in the specific interfacial area obtained by Equation 
(4-3). The relative error is –55% at aspect ratio α=0.5, and becomes about –100% when 
α goes to zero. In the case of different bubble sizes and aspect ratios for the whole bubble 
population, the relative error in the specific interfacial area is the combination of that 
shown in Figure 4-12, and is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as that shown 
in Figure 4-12. It is obvious by this simulation that the error in the specific interfacial 
obtained by Equation (4-3) may be very large for nonspherical bubbles. Hence, Equation 
(4-3) is an oversimplification for practical multiphase systems, and it can be treated only 
as a rough estimate of the specific interfacial area and Sauter mean bubble diameter. 

 
98
 
Figure 4-12.  Relative Error in the Specific Interfacial Area 
Obtained by Equation (4-3) 
 
However, for simplification, researchers often assume bubbles are of spherical shape in 
multiphase systems, e.g., bubble columns, and then employ Equation (4-3) to get the 
specific interfacial area from the gas holdup and Sauter mean bubble diameter. Obviously 
this is not accurate for almost any bubble column. However, the error caused by this 
simplification has never been analyzed or mentioned. Equation (4-3) was employed in 
this study to get the Sauter mean bubble diameter in order to compare it with the results 
of other researchers, and in order to qualitatively study the effect of operating conditions 
on the Sauter mean bubble diameter. 
 
 
 
 

 
99
The validation of the specific interfacial area measurement obtained by the four-point 
probe against video imaging was also conducted in the 2D bubble column shown in 
Figure 4-5. The video imaging analysis of the specific interfacial area was performed as 
follows: 
 
(1) Bubbles were assumed to be ellipsoidal, so each bubble in a photo frame was mapped 
to an approximate ellipsoid. 
 
(2) With the length of the major axis, c, and the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid, α, of the 
approximate ellipsoid, the surface area of the bubble, a, was calculated with Equation (4-
4). 
 
(3) A small region around the central tip of the probe (about 2×2cm) is selected, and the 
surface area of each bubble in this small region was summed up and divided by the 
volume of the region to obtain the specific interfacial area in this region. 
 
The results are listed in Table 4-3. Bubbles of different Reb and Eob were generated, and 
the specific interfacial areas at different conditions were measured. The Reb and Eob were 
adjusted by generating bubble streams of different mean bubble sizes. Due to the 
simplifying assumption of ellipsoidal bubble shape, the specific interfacial area obtained 
by the video imaging is expected to be smaller than the real value. This is because real 
bubbles are usually somewhat deformed from ellipsoidal shape, so that the surface area is 
larger than that of an ellipsoid of the same projected area on the photo by the CCD 
camera. Hence, the specific area obtained by video imaging should be treated only as a 
reference rather than a standard. It can be seen from Table 4-3 that the specific interfacial 
area obtained by the four-point probe is approximately equal to that obtained by video 
imaging. The relative errors are positive and within 23%. Hence, the specific interfacial 
area obtained by the four-point probe seems to be reasonable. Due to the inherent 
inaccuracy of the specific interfacial area obtained by the video imaging, no more runs 
were conducted.

4.3  Validation of the Local Gas Holdup 
 
The validation of the local gas holdup obtained by the probe was conducted in the setup 
shown in Figure 4-13. The column consists of an outer pipe with an inner diameter of 5.5 
cm and a height of 105 cm, and an inner pipe with an inner diameter of 0.6 cm and a 
height of 100 cm. A gas nozzle was installed at the bottom of the inner pipe. Taylor 
bubbles are generated at the bottom, and move upward all the way through the inner pipe. 
By adjusting the valve on the liquid flow circuit, the liquid flow rate in the inner pipe can 
be controlled. Since bubbles rise with the liquid, the velocity of bubbles can also be 
adjusted in this way so that the gas holdup in the inner pipe can be adjusted. The probe is 
positioned in the center of the inner pipe, about 98 cm to the bottom.

It is important to recognize that the gas holdup obtained by the probe, which is time 
based, is a little different from the volume based gas holdup, which is commonly used. 
The definition of volume based gas holdup is that it is the fraction of the whole 
multiphase system volume that is occupied by the gas phase. Based on this definition, the 
overall gas holdup in bubble columns can be measured using the bed expansion method

Clearly the gas holdup obtained by Equation (4-8) is volume based, and that obtained by 
Equation (4-9) is time based. The difference between these two definitions becomes 
apparent by transforming Equation (4-9) from time based to volume based. As Figure 4-

In Equation (4-11c), vi is the velocity of the ith gas-liquid interface (bubble leading 
phase), tG,i is the time interval that the probe tip spends in the ith gas section (bubble), 
and tL,i is the time interval that the probe tip spends in the ith liquid section. 
 
According to the calculus of random variables (Bruce, 1985), if vi and tG,i are

i and tG,i are statistically independent. However, in 
bubble columns vi are not independent of tG,i and tL,i because large bubbles move faster

Thus, a positive value of

they move with the wake of the large bubbles. In such a case, a positive value of

The comparison of the local gas holdup obtained by the optical probe and by the camera 
is shown in Table 4-4 and Figure 4-15. The relative errors are always negative within the 
range of –8.62%~-0.49%. The mean relative error is –2.64%. Hence, the local gas holdup 
obtained by the optical probe is reliable in this case. 
 
The distributions of the time intervals that the probe’s central tip spends in bubbles 
obtained by the probe and by the camera are displayed in Figure 4-16. It can be seen that 
these two distributions match well, except that the probe gave a little higher probability at 
small time intervals than the camera. This is because the interaction between the probe tip 
and the bubble’s leading edge dents the bubble, and causes the chord length pierced by 
the probe tip to be shorter than the real value. This dent is also the reason that the probe 
produced lower gas holdup values than the camera. In conclusion, the time intervals that 
the probe’s central tip spent in bubbles obtained by the probe are reliable in this case.

Figure 4-17.  Deformation of the Bubble’s Leading Edge 
due to the Interaction with the Probe Tip 
 
In the setup shown in Figure 4-13, bubbles are forced to move in the probe’s axial 
direction, i.e., vertical direction. However, as mentioned before, in bubble columns the 
direction of motion for many bubbles deviates significantly from the probe’s axial 
direction, due to the complexity of the flow field. In this case, the deformation of the 
bubble’s leading edge when it hits the probe tip may be more serious than that of bubbles 
that move in the probe’s axial direction. This is because in this case the projection of the 
probe’s tip on the bubble’s leading edge is large (Figure 4-17), i.e., not only the optical 
fiber’s tip, but also a part of the fiber body presses on the bubble’s leading edge and 
forces it to deform. As stated before, the observed underestimation of the local gas 

 
108
holdup is possibly caused by the deformation of the bubble’s leading edge. Hence, it is 
expected that larger deformation of the bubble’s leading edge causes larger error in the 
local gas holdup obtained by the probe.  
 
Furthermore, in the setup shown in Figure 4-13, bubbles are restricted in the inner pipe, 
so there is no room for bubbles to slip away from the probe’s tip. This is different from 
the condition in bubble columns, where small bubbles may avoid the probe tip, due to the 
disturbance of the flow field by the probe (Chabot et al., 1992). Hence, it is expected that 
the error in the local gas holdup obtained by the four-point probe in bubble columns will 
still be negative, and the relative errors are larger than those shown in Table 4-4. This is 
proved by the experiments conducted in a 3D bubble column as described later. 
 
The 2D bubble column is not suitable for the validation of the local gas holdup obtained 
by the probe. This is because in the 2D bubble column, the local gas holdup obtained by 
the camera is not accurate in the case of non-spherical bubbles, due to several factors: (1) 
To extract the local gas holdup by the camera, one needs to assume the shape of bubbles, 
e.g., to be ellipsoidal, and get the volume of bubbles from their projection on the CCD 
plane. Obviously the bubble volume obtained in this way is not accurate for deformed 
bubbles. (2) When the major symmetry plane of bubbles (the symmetry plane that 
contains the major axes of an ellipsoidal bubble) is not vertical to the CCD plane (this is 
common, especially for small bubbles, which rotate continuously during their rise), the 
profile of bubbles obtained will be larger than the real value (refer to Figure 4-5). 
Moreover, as mentioned before, the local gas holdup cannot be determined in the 2D 
bubble column at relatively high gas holdup, as in bubble columns, due to the overlap of 
bubbles. Hence, the verification of the local gas holdup obtained by the probe was not 
conducted in the 2D bubble column. 
 
As described before, the bubble chord lengths being pierced by the probe cannot be 
derived accurately by the camera in the 2D bubble column. However, the bubble chord 
length is obtained by the product of the bubble velocity, v, and the time interval that a 

 
109
probe tip spent in that bubble, Ti: 
i
i
T
v
L
⋅
=
. Hence, it is reasonable to assert that after the 
validation of the bubble velocity and the time intervals that a probe tip spent in bubbles, 
the bubble chord lengths obtained by the probe are also indirectly validated. 
 
In conclusion, the validation against video imaging shows that the bubble velocity 
distribution, mean bubble velocity, bubble chord length distribution, specific interfacial 
area, and local gas holdup obtained by the four-point optical probe are reliable. Hence, 
the probe is applied in bubble columns at different operating conditions to investigate 
bubble properties in systems of practical interest.

Chapter 5  Bubble Properties in Bubble Columns 
Obtained by the Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
After validation of the four-point optical probe measurements in 2D systems, the probe 
was utilized in 3D bubble columns under specified operating conditions of interest to 
measure the bubble velocity distribution, bubble chord length distribution, local gas 
holdup, and specific interfacial area. 
 
5.1  Experimental Setup 
 
The configuration of the 16.2 cm (6.4”) diameter stainless steel bubble column is shown 
in Figure 5-1. The setup was operated in the batch mode with tap water as the liquid 
phase and filtered, dry compressed air as the gas phase. The four-point probe 
measurements were conducted at different gas velocities and at atmospheric and high 
pressures. The operating conditions employed are listed in Table 5-1. Three axial 
positions, i.e., z/D= 1.7, 5.1, and 8.5, and seven radial positions, i.e., r/R=±0.9, r/R=±0.6, 
r/R=±0.3 and r/R=0, (where positive and negative values of r/R represent different sides 
along the diameter of the column in the plane of measurement, Figure 5-1), were selected 
for measurements of the local bubble properties. The optical probe must employ the fixed 
ports on the column wall.  Due to the physical limitation of the column, i.e., the ports are 
all located on the same vertical plane (Figure 5-1), the radial measuring positions at each 
axial position are along one diameter and the measurements of the bubble properties were 
conducted at one single vertical plane and one angular position in the column. The 
configuration of the spargers used is shown in Figure 5-2 and Table 5-2.

The operating conditions were the same as those used for the CT and CARPT 
experiments conducted in CREL (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). The axial measurement 
positions are a little different from those in the CT experiments (z/D= 2.1, 5.5, 9.0) 
because the optical probe must employ the fixed ports on the column wall, while the CT 
can be positioned freely anywhere along the axial direction. The operating principle of 
the four-point probe, discussed earlier, ensures that it accurately measures bubbles 
moving upwards when it is positioned downwards, and vice versa. Visual observation 
indicates that many bubbles move downwards in bubble columns in transition flow and 
churn-turbulent flow, especially in the wall zone. Hence, the four-point probe was 
positioned in two directions at each measuring site, i.e., upwards and downwards, and the 
probe tip was positioned at the same point when the probe was positioned upwards or 
downwards (Figure 5-1). In this way both bubbles moving upwards and those moving 
downwards can be measured, instead of only bubbles moving upwards as done in most 
other studies involving probes. 
 
5.2  Comparison of the Gas Holdup Profile Obtained by Probe and by CT 
 
The radial profiles of local gas holdup obtained by CT (data of Boon Cheng Ong, 2003, is 
used) and by the four-point optical probe were compared. If the gas holdup profile 
obtained by the two techniques matched well, and the integrated cross-sectional gas 
holdup matched the overall gas holdup obtained by the bed expansion height method 
within reasonable error, then one could claim that both the gas holdup profile obtained by 
CT and by the four-point optical probe method are reliable. 
 
Figure 5-3 displays an example of the comparison of mean gas holdup radial profiles 
obtained by CT and the four-point optical probe at atmospheric pressure. Detailed results 
can be found in Appendix D. The value of the gas holdup obtained by the probe shown in 
Figures 5-3 and 5-4 is the mean of the values at the symmetric radial positions in the 
column along the single chord, i.e. for r/R=0.3 the gas holdup is the mean of the values 
obtained at r/R=±0.3. It can be seen that at atmospheric pressure the results of CT and the 

 
114
probe match well, with relative error less than ±15% in most cases (refer to Table B-1).

Figure 5-3.  Comparison of Gas Holdup by CT and by Probe at Atmospheric 
        Pressure (Sparger #2) 
 
It can be seen from Figure 5-3b that the cross-sectional gas holdup obtained by CT and 
by the probe match the overall gas holdup pretty well at atmospheric pressure. Both of 
them are smaller than the overall gas holdup, with relative errors of –10%~-18%. Hence, 
at atmospheric pressure, both the CT and the four-point optical probe provide reasonable 
gas holdup values with negative systematic errors of acceptable magnitude for 
engineering estimates. 
 
Figure 5-4 displays the comparison of gas holdup profiles obtained by CT and by the 
probe at both atmospheric and high pressures for sparger #3. It can be seen that for this 
sparger at atmospheric pressure the gas holdup profiles obtained by these two methods 
match well. At high pressures the gas holdup obtained by CT and by the probe obviously 
deviate from each other and the gas holdup obtained by the probe is always larger than 
that obtained by CT. From Table 5-3, it can be seen that at high pressure the relative error 
in the cross sectional gas holdup obtained by CT and the overall holdup can be as large as 
–37.2% (0.4MPa), while that obtained by the probe is still within the same range as at 
atmospheric pressure. Since the cross-sectional gas holdup obtained by the probe fits the 

 
116
overall gas holdup better than that obtained by CT at high pressure, it is believed that the 
probe still gave reliable gas holdup measurements at high pressure. The reason for the 
large errors in the gas holdup obtained by CT at high pressure is still unknown and should 
be investigated. It should be noted that although CT holdup measurements and probe 
measurements were done at identical conditions in the same size column, the tap water 
used was different and the axial positions for measurements are about 2 inches apart. 
Water impurities are known to affect the gas holdup (Tang and Heindel, 2004).

5.3  The Effect of Superficial Gas Velocity 
 
The superficial gas velocity, Ug, is one of the key operating variables that affects the 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns, including bubble properties. The effect of Ug on 
bubbles at atmospheric pressure in bubble columns was investigated in this study. Figure 
5-5a shows the radial profiles of local gas holdup, εg,l, at different Ug and the changes of 
εg,l with Ug at different radial positions. The error bars are also displayed. It is clear from 
Figure 5-5a that the radial profile of local gas holdup is flat at Ug=2 cm/s, which is 
bubbly flow. The local gas holdup profile is parabolic when Ug is larger than 8 cm/s, 
when the flow changes from transition flow to churn-turbulent flow. Furthermore, the 
higher the gas velocity, the steeper the parabolic profile. These observations are 
corroborated with the CT experimental results. It is also noticed that the bubble properties 
are not strictly symmetric in the radial direction in the range of measurements. Visual 
observation through the windows on the column wall indicates the asymmetry of the flow 
in the column. Possible causes for the asymmetry could be the bubble column alignment 
departure from verticality, lack of symmetry for the sparger used, and the coherent 
structure in the flow (Groen et al., 1996). In the following text, if the bubble properties 
are alike at symmetric radial positions then only bubble properties at one side are shown, 
e.g. if the bubble chord length distribution at r/R=0.9 and r/R=-0.9 is alike, so only the 
one at r/R=-0.9 is shown. 
 
It is found that the radial profiles of both specific interfacial area (Figure 5-5b) and 
bubble frequency (the number of bubbles that hit the central tip of the probe per second) 
and their changes with Ug are similar to the radial profile of the local gas holdup. The 
similarity between these profiles is the result of the fact that local gas holdup, specific 
interfacial area and bubble frequency are strongly correlated. Speaking generally, an 
increase in bubble frequency leads to an increase in gas holdup and specific interfacial 
area.

The radial profiles of mean bubble velocity at different Ug are shown in Figure 5-6. The 
positive value of bubble velocity means that bubbles move upwards, while the negative 
value means that bubbles move downwards. The mean bubble velocity,

As expected, the radial profile of mean bubble velocity was flat at Ug=2 cm/s, which is 
bubbly flow, and it was parabolic when Ug was larger than 8 cm/s, when flow changes to 
transition flow and churn-turbulent flow (Figure 5-6a). Figure 5-6b shows that the mean 
bubble velocity was always positive and increased with Ug in the core of the column, and 
the rate of increase in the mean bubble velocity with Ug in the bubbly flow regime was 
faster than in the churn-turbulent flow regime. In the wall zone (r/R=±0.9), 
b
v
 was 
positive in bubbly flow (Ug = 2cm/s) and was small or even negative at Ug>8 cm/s. 
Above Ug of 14 cm/s, the magnitude of 
b
v  increased slowly with Ug; in the range of Ug 
investigated (Ug = 2~60 cm/s) the minimum 
b
v
 was detected at Ug= 8cm/s, in the 
transition regime from bubbly flow to churn-turbulent flow, in the wall zone.

Figure 5-6.  The Radial Profile of Mean Bubble Velocity and Its Change with Ug 
              (Sparger #2, z/D=5.1) 
 
The bubble velocity distribution in the wall zone (Figure 5-7, r/R=±0.9, z/D=5.1) 
obtained by the four-point optical probe clarifies the observed behavior for the mean 

 
121
bubble velocity, 
b
v
. It should be noted that a large portion of bubbles of very low 
velocity cannot be measured by the probe. This is because it takes relatively long time for 
very slow bubbles to pass through the four tips of the probe. During this time interval if 
the flow field around the bubble changes, the bubble velocity also changes during its 
passage by the probe since bubbles move with liquid flow. In this case the velocity of the 
bubble determined by the four-point probe is a mean of the early slow velocity and the 
later high velocity. Hence, the four-point probe tends to underestimate the probability of 
bubbles of very low velocity. However, it should be noted that this bias is usually not 
significant because the vertical distance between the central tip and the other tips of the 
probe is about 2 mm, if the time scale of the flow field change is 0.1 s, then only bubbles 
with velocity lower than about 2 cm/s will be affected. Usually the percentage of bubbles 
with velocity as low as this is very low. The bias happens both for bubbles that move 
upwards and downwards, so the mean bubble velocity is not affected much by this bias. 
At Ug=2 cm/s all bubbles moved upwards (Figure 5-7a), and the peak in the bubble 
velocity distribution was thin and sharp. At Ug>8 cm/s, the bubble velocity distributions 
at r/R=-0.9 and r/R=0.9 were different. At r/R=-0.9, more bubbles moved downwards 
than upwards. At r/R=0.9, almost as many bubbles moved upwards as downwards. As a 
result, the radial profile of the mean bubble velocity was not symmetric at z/D=5.1 and 
the mean bubble velocity at r/R=-0.9 was smaller than that at r/R=0.9 (Figure 5-6a). 
When Ug increased from 8 cm/s to 14 cm/s (i.e., in the transition flow regime) the mean 
velocity of bubbles moving upwards increased greatly (from 9.45 to 20.9cm/s at r/R=-0.9 
and from 12.4 to 28.3cm/s at r/R=0.9) while that of bubbles moving downwards 
increased mildly in magnitude (from –33.8 to -39.1cm/s at r/R=-0.9 and –28.2 to -
34.6cm/s at r/R=0.9). This is because large bubbles, which have high velocity, arose in 
the transition flow regime (this is evident from an increase in the number of bubbles of 
high velocity in the bubble velocity distributions at Ug=8 cm/s and 14 cm/s, Figures 5-8b 
and 5-8c) and assembled in the central stream of the column. The velocity of bubbles 
moving downwards in the wall zone increased mainly due to the enhancement of the 
liquid recirculation caused by the appearance of large bubbles in the central stream. 
Hence, the velocity of bubbles moving upwards jumped and of bubbles moving 

 
122
downwards increases only mildly in the transition flow regime. In churn-turbulent flow, 
at Ug>14cm/s, the percentage of bubbles moving downwards increased slowly with Ug 
in the wall zone.

Figure 5-7.  Bubble Velocity Distribution in the Wall Region at Different Superficial 
          Gas Velocities (z/D=5.1, Sparger #2) 
 
The bubble velocity distributions in the center of the bubble column (r/R=0, z/D= 5.1) at 
different Ug are shown in Figure 5-8. In contrast to the wall zone, most bubbles move 
upwards in the column center. The percentage of bubbles moving downwards increased 
with Ug, but even at Ug as high as 60cm/s, only a small percentage of bubbles moved 
downwards in the column center. Bubbles moving downwards in the column center may 
be small bubbles that exist in the wakes of large bubbles, which may have negative 
velocity due to liquid recirculation in the wakes. In churn-turbulent flow, the number of 
large bubbles increases with Ug, so there are more bubbles moving downwards being 
detected by the four-point probe. The bubble velocity distribution in the column center 
spreads more widely with increased Ug, and the magnitude of the mean velocity of 
bubbles moving upwards is much larger than that of bubbles moving downwards.

Figure 5-8.  Bubble Velocity Distribution at Different Superficial Gas Velocities 
               (r/R=0, z/D=5.1, Sparger #2) 
 
The bubble chord length distributions obtained by the four-point optical probe at different 
gas velocities in the wall zone (r/R=-0.9; the shape of bubble chord length distributions at 
r/R=0.9 are similar to that at r/R=-0.9.) and in the center (r/R=0) of the bubble column are 
displayed in Figure 5-9. At column center (r/R=0), the number of the bubbles used for the 
calculation of the bubble chord length distribution is over 10,000 at Ug≥8 cm/s and about 
4,000 at Ug =2cm/s. In the wall region (r/R=-0.9), the number is over 5,000 and about 
4,000, respectively. This large number of the bubbles available for the derivation of the 
bubble chord length distribution and mean bubble chord length makes the results reliable. 
It can be seen that in the column center the bubble chord length distribution spreads 
wider, and the probability for both small and large chord lengths increases with increased 
Ug (Figure 5-9a). In the wall zone (Figure 5-9b), the shape of the bubble chord length 
distribution does not change much with Ug when Ug ≥ 8 cm/s. The probability of small 
bubble chord length increases with Ug, while that of large bubble chord length does not 
change much with Ug. This is also because the large bubbles pass through the bubble 
column in the core of the central bubble stream, as described by Chen, Reese and Fan 
(1994), and seldom move into the wall zone, while small bubbles tend to enter the wall 
zone and move with the downwards liquid flow.

Figure 5-9.  Bubble Chord Length Distribution at Different Superficial Gas 
             Velocities (Sparger #2, 0.1MPa, z/D=5.1) 
 
The mean bubble chord length and the standard deviation of the bubble chord length 
distributions are plotted in Figure 5-10. The error bar for the mean bubble chord length is 
also shown. It can be seen that the mean and standard deviation of the bubble chord 
length distribution in the column center are almost identical to those in the wall zone at 
Ug=2 cm/s, where the central stream of large bubbles does not exist, and at Ug=8 cm/s, 
where the liquid recirculation starts, however, the number of large bubbles in the central 
stream is still small. When Ug ≥ 14 cm/s, the mean and standard deviation of the bubble 
chord length distribution in the column center are much larger than those in the wall zone 
due to the assembly of large bubbles in the central bubble stream. In the column center, 
the mean bubble chord length increases with Ug when Ug ≤ 30cm/s and decreases 
slightly with Ug when Ug ≥ 30 cm/s (Figure 5-10a); the standard deviation increases 
quickly between Ug = 8 cm/s and Ug = 30 cm/s and decreases slightly with Ug when Ug 
≥ 30 cm/s. This is because in the transition flow regime and churn-turbulent flow regime, 
bubbles break and coalesce, and the number of both large and small bubbles increases 
and the bubble size distribution spreads wider than the relatively uniform bubble size 
distribution in bubbly flow. In the churn-turbulent flow regime the increase in the number 
of small bubbles is faster than that of large bubbles, so the mean bubble chord length 

 
126
decreases slightly with Ug. In the wall zone, the mean bubble chord length increases with 
Ug when Ug ≤ 8cm/s and decreases somewhat with Ug when Ug ≥ 8 cm/s. The standard 
deviation keeps increasing with Ug in the range Ug=2 cm/s to 60 cm/s, but the rate of 
increase is much slower than that in the column center. This is also the consequence of 
the fact that the large bubbles gather in the column center, and mainly small bubbles exist 
in the wall zone of the column.

                       Distribution at Different Superficial Gas Velocities 
 
Figure 5-11 shows the bubble velocity distribution and bubble chord length distribution at 
different radial positions in the bubble column (at radial positions r/R=0, -0.3, -0.6 and -
0.9 only, the shape of the bubble velocity distribution and bubble chord length 
distribution at symmetric radial positions, r/R=0.3, 0.6 and 0.9, are alike). It can be seen 
from Figure 5-11a that the percentage of bubbles moving downwards increases from the 
column center to the wall zone; in the core of the column the change is slow, and bubbles 
moving upwards are in the majority, while in the wall zone bubbles moving downwards 
predominate. Since bubbles move with the liquid flow, this phenomenon is corroborated 
by research findings on liquid recirculation in bubble columns, which shows that the 

 
127
transition from upflow to downflow for the liquid recirculation happens at r/R=0.6~0.7 
(Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). As shown in Figure 5-11b, the bubble chord length 
distributions in the core of the column are alike in shape. A sudden change happens 
within the wall zone where the percentage of small bubble chord lengths increases greatly 
because mainly small bubbles exist in the wall zone of the column. Hence, it can be 
concluded that in churn-turbulent flow in the core of the column (r/R<0.6) the shape of 
the bubble velocity and bubble chord length distributions are alike, while in the wall zone 
they are very different from those in the core of the column.

                     Radial Positions (Sparger #2, Ug=60 cm/s, z/D=5.1) 
 
Figure 5-12 shows the relationship between the bubble velocity and the bubble chord 
length at the center of the column at different Ug. It should be noted that the bubble 
velocity is the sum of the liquid velocity and the bubble’s slip velocity since bubbles 
move with the liquid flow in bubble columns. In other words, bubble size is not the only 
factor that affects the bubble velocity. In churn-turbulent flow, it is not even the decisive 
factor in some cases, e.g. many small bubbles have as high velocity as large bubbles 
(Figure 5-12c and d) because they exist in the wake of large bubbles and move with the 
large bubbles. As expected, the bubble velocity roughly increases with bubble size in 

 
128
bubbly flow and it is much higher in churn-turbulent flow than in bubbly flow. In churn-
turbulent flow, the velocity of a portion of small bubbles is as high as large bubbles 
(Figure 5-12d). This is because many small bubbles exist in the wake of large bubbles 
and hence move with the large bubbles. In a few cases, large bubbles have relatively low 
velocity. The possible reason is that large bubbles turn to vibrate seriously during 
movement, if the probe hits the part of a large bubble that is vibrating in the opposite 
direction of the bubble velocity, then the velocity detected by the probe will be much 
lower than the real velocity of the bubble. Besides, the flow field in bubble columns is 
very complicated and it affects the bubble velocity seriously. The simultaneous existence 
of down flow liquid stream may also decrease the velocity of some large bubbles.

5.4  The Effect of Pressure 
 
Pressure is one of the key operating variables that affects the hydrodynamics in bubble 
columns. To investigate the pressure effect, bubble properties at 0.1MPa, 0.4MPa and 
1.0MPa and at Ug=30cm/s were determined in this study. It can be seen from Figure 5-13 
that both gas holdup and specific interfacial area increase greatly with pressure in the 
range of 0.1MPa to 1.0 MPa at Ug=30cm/s, and the increase is almost uniform across the 
column diameter. Furthermore, the increases in gas holdup and specific interfacial area 
when pressure increases from 0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa are much larger than when pressure 
increases from 0.4 MPa to 1.0 MPa, i.e., the effect of pressure is weak when pressure 
increases from 0.4 MPa to 1.0 MPa, especially for the specific interfacial area (Figure 5-
13b).

                     (Sparger #3, 30 cm/s, z/D = 5.1) 
 
In the studies conducted by LaNauze and Harris (1974) and Fan et al. (1999), it was 
shown that with increasing pressure, smaller and more frequent bubbles are formed at the 
gas sparger, which is attributed to the increased contribution of the gas momentum to the 
bubble formation process. According to the study by Igodawa et al. (1987), for sparger #3 
and at Ug=30 cm/s, the bubble formation is in bubbling regime at 0.1MPa and it is in 
jetting regime at 0.4 and 1.0 MPa (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). In the jetting regime, it was 
observed that smaller and more frequent bubbles are formed at a single orifice (Igodawa 
et al., 1987). This was proved by the bubble frequency in the sparger zone of the bubble 
column obtained by the four-point probe at different pressures, as shown in Figure 5-14a. 
It can be seen from Figure 5-14 that the bubble frequency increases greatly with pressure 
in the sparger zone and even beyond the sparger zone at z/D=5.1.

Figure 5-14.  Pressure Effect on Bubble Frequency (Sparger #3, 30 cm/s) 
 
In the core of the column, the mean bubble velocity also increases with pressure, but this 
increase is not as prominent as that of gas holdup and specific interfacial area (Figure 5-
15). This is because on one hand the bubble size decreases with pressure; on the other 
hand, liquid recirculation is enhanced at high pressure (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003). These 
two factors have opposite effects on the mean bubble velocity: the former decreases the 
bubble velocity, because small bubbles have lower terminal velocity than large bubbles; 
the later increases the bubble velocity, since bubbles move with the liquid flow. These 
two factors somewhat counteract each other, so that the net effect of pressure on mean 
bubble velocity is weak. In the wall zone the downward movement of bubbles was 
obviously enhanced with the pressure. This is because the enhancement of the liquid 
recirculation dominates in the wall zone since there are no large bubbles there, thus the 
decrease of the bubble size with pressure was not as significant as in the core of the 
column. In short, at higher pressure the mean bubble velocity profile becomes more 
parabolic.

                   (Sparger #3, 30 cm/s, z/D = 5.1) 
 
It can be seen from Figure 5-16a that pressure does not affect the bubble velocity 
distribution very much in the column center. To a small extent, the percentage of bubbles 
moving downwards decreases with pressure, but the shape of the bubble velocity 
distribution is essentially identical. The situation is different in the wall zone, as shown in 
Figure 5-16b and 5-17c. In the wall zone, at r/R=-0.9 the percentage of bubbles that 
moved downwards increased greatly with pressure, so that the shape of the bubble 
velocity distribution changed notably with pressure. However, at r/R=0.9 the change of 
the shape of the bubble velocity distribution with pressure is not obvious. It is also 
noticed that in the column center the mean velocity of bubbles moving upwards increases 
somewhat with pressure, while that of bubbles moving downwards decreases. The 
opposite trend occurs in the wall zone. This means that the liquid recirculation is 
enhanced by pressure since bubbles move with the liquid flow in bubble columns. The 
same conclusion was reached in CARPT experiments at the same conditions by Boon 
Cheng Ong (2003) and in the literature (Jiang et al., 1995; Fan et al., 1999; Chen et al., 
1999b). This conclusion is in line with the analysis of the effect of pressure on the mean 
bubble velocity profiles reviewed before.

As shown in Figure 5-17, the shape of the bubble chord length distribution changes 
somewhat with pressure and the mean bubble chord length decreases in both the wall 
zone and the column center when the pressure changes from 0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa. It is 
expected that the bubble size decreases with pressure (Fan et al., 1999; Lin, Tsuchiya and 
Fan, 1998). Nevertheless, at pressure higher than 0.4 MPa, the mean bubble chord length 
stays almost identical and in some cases increases slightly with pressure. One explanation 
might be that when the number of large bubbles decreases with pressure, the number of 

 
134
small bubbles in the wake of large bubbles also decreases. Furthermore, as expected, the 
mean bubble chord length in the column center is much larger than that in the wall zone, 
due to the assembly of large bubbles in the column center.

5.5  The Effect of Spargers 
 
It has been reported that the configuration of the sparger, e.g., the number and size of the 
orifices, affects the generation of bubbles and subsequently may affect the 
hydrodynamics in bubble columns (LaNauze and Harris, 1974; Tsuge and Hibino, 1983; 
Idogawa et al., 1987; Tsuge et al., 1992; Yoo et al., 1998; Snabre and Magnifotcham, 
1998; Terasaka et al., 1999; Hsu et al., 2000). As shown in Figure 5-2 and detailed in 
Table 5-2, three spargers were used in this study: a cross sparger (sparger #1), a 
perforated plate with 0.15% open area (sparger #2), and a perforated plate with 1.0% 
open area (sparger #3). 
 
It was found that, in the sparger zone (z/D=1.7), the bubble frequency increased in the 
order of sparger #1, sparger #3, and sparger #2, as shown in Figure 5-18. Sparger #1 and 
sparger #3, which are totally different in their hole numbers, hole sizes, and hole 
distributions, generate bubbles of relatively similar properties, e.g., bubble frequency, etc.

                 Holdup (0.1MPa, 30 cm/s, z/D = 1.7, r/R=0) 
 
Figure 5-19 shows the bubble chord length distributions in the column center in the 
sparger zone (z/D=1.7) for the three spargers. The distributions for sparger #1 and #3 are 
alike, except sparger #3 produced an additional peak at small values of bubble chord 
length. The bubble chord length distribution for sparger #2 has a higher probability 
density at small values of chord length. The mean bubble chord length and standard 
deviation of the bubble chord length distributions decreases in the order of sparger #1, 
sparger #3, and sparger #2 (Figure 5-19b). Consequently, the local gas holdup at z/D=1.7 
increases in the same order, i.e., sparger #2 produced the highest local gas holdup and 

 
137
sparger #1 and #3 gave almost the same gas holdup, as shown in Figure 5-19c. Some 
correlations have been developed for the estimation of the initial bubble size at the 
sparger (Ellenberger and Krishna, 1994; Leibson et al., 1956; Wallis, 1969). The 
estimated initial bubble sizes based on these predictions are listed in Table 5-4 (Boon 
Cheng Ong, 2003). Obviously the initial bubble size by the prediction of Ellenberger and 
Krishna (1994) is too large. The initial bubble sizes predicted by Leibson et al. (1956) 
and Wallis (1969) are of the same order of magnitude as the mean bubble chord length 
obtained by the four-point probe. Although the bubble size increases with axial position 
in the sparger zone due to bubble coalescence so that the bubble size at the measuring 
position of the probe (z/D=1.7) is larger than at the sparger, the bubble size predicted by 
the proposition of Wallis (1969) for sparger #2 and #3 still seems to be too small. 
Furthermore, the initial bubble size increases in the order of sparger#1, sparger#2 and 
sparger#3 according to the prediction of Leibson et al. (1956), while the mean bubble 
chord length obtained by the probe (r/R=0) increases in the order of sparger#2, sparger#3 
and sparger#1. Hence, the initial bubble size estimated by these predictions does not fit 
the experimental results in this study.

* In the sparger zone, z/D=1.7. 
 
The bubble velocity distributions in the sparger zone for different spargers are shown in 
Figure 5-20. It was found that sparger #1 and sparger #3 generated approximately the 
same bubble velocity distribution at different radial positions in the sparger zone (Figure 
5-20a, 5-23b and 5-23c). Sparger #2 generated more bubbles moving downwards in the 
wall zone, especially at r/R=-0.9 (Figure 5-20b). This is also clear from the radial profiles 

 
138
of the mean bubble velocity for different spargers (Figure 5-20d), where it can be seen 
that, for the three spargers used, the mean bubble velocity for sparger #2 is the smallest in 
the wall zone.

Sparger #2 also produced a higher specific interfacial area in the sparger zone than the 
other two spargers, as shown in Figure 5-21. This is in agreement with the radial profiles 
of the local gas holdup (Figure 5-19c) and bubble frequency (Figure 5-18), due to the 
correlation of these three variables.

Earlier by CT and CARPT experiments Boon Cheng Ong (2003) found that deep in the 
churn-turbulent flow regime (Ug≥30cm/s) at atmospheric pressure there are small effects 
of the distributor on the radial gas holdup profile and liquid recirculation in the fully 
developed region (z/D≥5.5). The sparger effect on bubble properties in the fully 
developed region obtained by the four-point probe is shown in Figure 5-22. It can be seen 
that at atmospheric pressure, the sparger effect on the radial profile of gas holdup, bubble 
frequency, mean bubble velocity, and specific interfacial area is small at z/D=5.1. The 
exception is noted in the wall zone for mean bubble velocity and may be caused by the 
existence of coherent structures (Groen et al., 1996), which makes the flow field in the 
wall zone asymmetric and causes frequent changes in the flow direction. In other words, 
the radial profiles of the bubble frequency, the mean bubble velocity, and the specific 
interfacial area for the three spargers follow the same rule as the gas holdup profiles.

Figure 5-22.  Bubble Properties at z/D=5.1 for Different Spargers 
 
5.6  The Effect of Axial Position 
 
In churn-turbulent flow, in the near sparger region, the bubble size continuously changes 
with respect to distance from the sparger and finally attains the equilibrium bubble size 
distribution, which is decided by the balance between bubble breakup and coalescence in 
bubble columns. The region where the bubble size changes is called the sparger region. 
The height of the sparger region depends on the configuration of the column and the 
sparger, the properties of the liquid and gas phase, and the operating conditions. It was 

 
141
reported that the height of the sparger region in bubble columns is in the range of 1 ≤ z/D 
≤ 5 (Joshi et al., 1998). On the other hand, Shollenberger et al. (1997) reported sparger 
effect only up to 2.5 diameter heights in churn-turbulent flow. Beyond the sparger region, 
the gas holdup profile does not change with axial position in the bubble column. Besides 
the gas holdup profiles, the changes in other bubble properties with axial position were 
also investigated in this study. 
 
At high pressure, it is observed that the gas holdup increases with the axial position in the 
column (Figure 5-23b and c), while at atmospheric pressure, when the other conditions 
are the same, the effect of axial position on the gas holdup profile was not obvious 
(Figure 5-23a). This result at high pressure is contrary to the findings at Sandia National 
Laboratory (Shollenberger, Torczynski and George, 2002). However, the liquid system 
used in their research was drakeoil, not water.

Figure 5-23.  Gas Holdup Profile at Different Axial Positions at High Pressure 
                (Sparger #3, Ug=30 cm/s) 
 
The reason for the increase in the gas holdup with the axial position at high pressure can 
be found by analyzing the holdup of large bubbles and small bubbles in the column 
center, as shown in Figure 5-24. The classification of bubbles into large and small ones is 
explained in detail later in Section 5.8. It can be seen that at atmospheric pressure the 
small bubble holdup decreases with axial position in the sparger zone and arrives at a 
constant value at z/D>5.1, while the large bubble holdup increases in the sparger zone 
and reaches its asymptotic value in the fully developed zone. This is because bubble 
coalescence leads to a decrease in the number of small bubbles and an increase in the 
number of large bubbles in the fully developed region. At high pressure, the small bubble 
holdup does not change much with the axial position, while the large bubble holdup 
keeps increasing in the axial direction. 
 
The reason for this difference between atmospheric pressure and high pressures is 
unknown. One possibility is that an increase in pressure causes a decrease in the bubble 
size, and smaller bubbles are more stable than large bubbles (Fan, 1999) at the free 
surface. Hence, at high pressures bubbles accumulate in the upper zone of the column, 
leading to an increase in gas holdup in the axial direction. The effect of pressure on 

 
143
bubble coalescence and breakage has not been reported in the literature. As shown later, 
the examination of the change of bubble frequency along the axial direction of the 
column supports this explanation.

At atmospheric pressure bubble frequency was higher in the sparger zone than in the 
upper zone of the column for the sparger used (Figure 5-25a). This supports the notion 
that bubble coalescence leads to a decrease in the number of small bubbles and an 

 
144
increase in the number of large bubbles at atmospheric pressure. At high pressures, the 
opposite trend is true: the bubble frequency is lower in the sparger zone than in the upper 
zone of the column (Figure 5-25b and 5-30c). This fact supports the explanation for an 
increase in gas holdup in the axial direction at high pressure, i.e., the accumulation of 
bubbles in the upper zone of the column.

Figure 5-26 shows the bubble chord length distributions and mean bubble chord lengths 
at different pressures in the column center. The shape of the bubble chord length 
distributions is alike at different axial positions at high pressures (Figure 5-26a). The 
mean bubble chord length (Figure 5-26b) decreases slightly with axial position at 
atmospheric pressure, and it increases with axial position at 0.4 MPa and 1.0 MPa, which 
implies the enhancement of bubble coalescence due to the accumulation of bubbles in the 
upper zone of the column at high pressure. Furthermore, the mean bubble chord length 
decreases as pressure increases from 0.1 MPa to 0.4 MPa, as expected, but it does not 
change much at pressure higher than 0.4 MPa (Figure 5-26b).

In bubbly flow and transition flow, the changes in the radial profile of specific interfacial 
area with axial position, as illustrated in Figure 5-27a, follow the same pattern as the gas 
holdup profile, since they are correlated. At high pressure, the specific interfacial area 
increased with axial position (Figure 5-27b and 5-26c), which was contrary to the 
situation at atmospheric pressure (Figure 5-27a). This is due to the obvious increase in 
the gas holdup (Figure 5-23) in the axial direction at high pressure.

For the operating conditions employed in this study, the mean bubble velocity profile did 
not change much with axial position, except at low gas velocity (Ug =2 cm/s, shown in 
Figure 5-28). At Ug=2 cm/s the mean bubble velocity in the lower zone of the bubble 
column (z/D=1.7) was higher than that in the upper zone. This was possibly due to the 
large initial momentum of the bubbles jetting from the sparger and the lack of liquid 
recirculation at low gas velocity. This was not true when Ug ≥ 8 cm/s, i.e., in the 
transition and churn-turbulent region, where the mean bubble velocity in the core of the 

 
147
column did not change much with axial position. The situation was the same at high 
pressure and for the other spargers. This means that in the transition and churn-turbulent 
regime the mean bubble velocity profile developed very fast in the axial direction; in 
other words, the sparger zone for the mean bubble velocity profile was small. In the wall 
zone, the mean bubble velocity was different at different axial positions in both bubbly 
flow and churn-turbulent flow. This change was due to the complexity of the flow field, 
i.e., the flow direction changed with time and the existence of flow cells (Groen et al., 
1996).

5.7  The Sauter Mean Bubble Diameter 
 
Based on the local gas holdup and specific interfacial area obtained by the four-point 
probe, the Sauter mean bubble diameter, ds, can be calculated with Equation (2-1). As 
discussed in Section 4.2, Equation (2-1) is accurate only for spherical bubbles. In bubble 
columns, although most bubbles are not spherical, the Sauter mean bubble diameter 
obtained with Equation (2-1) is still valuable for qualitative analysis. Actually it is widely 
used as a description of the magnitude of bubble size in bubble columns. Hence, this 

 
148
parameter was also investigated in this study. The radial profiles of the Sauter mean 
bubble diameter at different gas velocities are shown in Figure 5-29. At Ug=2 cm/s, the 
radial profile of ds is flat, which is reasonable for bubbly flow. At Ug=8 cm/s and 14 
cm/s, the radial profile of ds is roughly flat. At higher gas velocity, the profile becomes 
parabolic due to an increase in ds in the column center and a decrease in the wall zone. 
This is true for churn-turbulent flow where large bubbles assemble in the central stream. 
It is also observed from Figure 5-29 that, unlike the radial profiles of gas holdup and 
specific interfacial area shown before, the radial profile of ds is rather irregular, i.e., the 
variation is large so that the profile is not smooth. This lack of smoothness of the radial 
profile indicates that the error in the Sauter mean bubble diameter obtained by Equation 
(2-1) is large and is most likely due to different bubble shape in various regions.

As expected, the radial profile of the Sauter mean bubble diameter becomes flat at high 
pressure, and the value of ds decreases greatly compared to the value at atmospheric 
pressure (Figure 5-30). Furthermore, ds does not change much as the pressure changes 

 
149
from 0.4 MPa to 1.0 MPa. This is consistent to the results for bubble chord length 
distribution as shown in Figure 5-26b. The above analysis indicates that while the Sauter 
mean bubble diameter is a valuable parameter to qualitatively describe the bubble size in 
bubble columns, it is subject to large errors.

5.8  The Bubble Size Distribution 
 
Krishna, Wilkinson and van Dierendonck (1991) inferred from gas disengagement 
experiments that there are both large and small bubbles in churn-turbulent flow. They 
proposed that beyond a certain regime transition velocity, the small bubble holdup is 
constant and the large bubble holdup keeps increasing with the gas velocity, as illustrated 
in Figure 5-31. Such a bimodal bubble size distribution is a characteristic feature of the 
churn-turbulent flow regime, they claimed. 
 

 
150
However, Deshpande, Dinkar and Joshi (1995) provided another explanation for the gas 
disengagement experimental results. They thought that the initial faster disengagement is 
due to internal liquid circulation and not due to the presence of very large bubbles, and, 
hence, they claimed that the bimodal bubble size distribution is not necessarily proven by 
the results of gas disengagement experiments. Since the bubble size distribution is 
important in modeling, design and scaleup of bubble columns, this must be clarified. To 
address this, the time based bubble chord length distribution, the large bubble holdup, and 
small bubble holdup obtained by the four-point probe were investigated. 
 
 
Figure 5-31.  Gas Holdup Model in Bubble Columns Proposed by 
                       Krishna, Wilkinson, and van Dierendonck (1991) 
 
It was necessary to classify bubbles into large and small based on an arbitrary criterion as 
to how long the probe tip resides in the bubble as indicated in Figure 5-32. At Ug=2cm/s, 
bubbly flow prevails in the column and there are few large bubbles. It can be seen in 
Figure 5-32 that the pdf of the bubble chord length ends at about t=0.02s at Ug=2 cm/s in 

 
151
the center of the column at r/R=0, and actually this is true at all the radial positions. 
Hence, the criterion for distinguishing large and small bubbles is set to be t=0.02s. Based 
on this criterion, if the time interval that the probe tip spends in a bubble is larger than t = 
0.02s, the bubble is classified as a large bubble; otherwise it is classified as a small 
bubble.

The small bubble holdup can be obtained in the same way. It is shown in Figure 5-33 that 
in the core of the column (r/R=0, r/R=-0.6) both the small bubble holdup and the large 
bubble holdup increase with Ug in churn-turbulent flow, and the small bubble holdup 
increases faster. In the wall zone, the large bubble holdup in churn turbulent flow is low 

 
152
and stays almost constant with an increase in Ug. Hence, the gas holdup model proposed 
by Krishna, Wilkinson, and van Dierendonck (1991) as shown in Figure 5-31 does not 
quite hold.

Figure 5-33.  Local Gas Holdup Obtained by the Probe 
 
Figure 5-34 shows the contribution to the local gas holdup of the time intervals that the 
probe’s central tip spends in bubbles. This is the volume based bubble chord length 
distribution in terms of time. It can be seen that the contribution of large bubble chord 
lengths to the local gas holdup increases with Ug, and becomes considerable at high Ug 

 
153
in the core of the column (Figure 5-34a). In the wall zone, the large bubble holdup does 
not change much with Ug and is negligible even at Ug=60 cm/s (Figure 5-34b). Hence, it 
can be concluded that the volume based bubble size distribution is not bimodal. Rather, it 
is single modal in the range of operating conditions employed.

Figure 5-34.  Time Based Bubble Chord Length Distribution 
 
The probe can detect only the bubble chord length distribution, and this is different from 
the bubble size distribution. For example, if the probe tip hits near the edge of a large 
bubble, a small chord length, which is possibly smaller than 0.02s, will be detected and 
this bubble will be classified as a “small” bubble according to the above criterion. 
However, the qualitative result obtained by the probe will not change due to the 
overwhelming number of small bubbles to large bubbles (Figure 5-32). Furthermore, it 
was found that a small change in this criterion does not change the shape of the gas 
holdup profiles shown in Figure 5-33. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the bubble 
size distribution is also single modal in the range of operating conditions employed in this 
study, which cover both bubbly flow and churn-turbulent flow. A simulation as shown in 
Appendix D.4 also proves this.

The time based bubble chord length distribution and large and small bubble holdups at 
high pressure are shown in Figure 5-35. At high pressure the small bubbles contribute 
much more to the gas holdup than the large bubbles, and the small bubble holdup 
increases obviously with pressure, while the large bubble holdup decreases with pressure 
(Figure 5-35b). This is in line with the fact that the bubble size decreases with pressure. 
Hence, if the bubble size distribution is not bimodal at atmospheric pressure, neither is it 
at high pressure at the same gas velocity, due to the reduction of the number of large 
bubbles.

                      and Gas Holdups (Sparger #3, Ug=30 cm/s, r/R=0, z/D=5.1) 
 
As explained before, only when a bubble hits all the four tips of the probe, the bubble 
velocity and the bubble chord length can be obtained. The volume based bubble chord 
length distribution of these measured bubbles is a good analogue of that for the whole 
bubble population due to the fact that the bubbles hit the probe randomly. Some examples 
of the volume based bubble chord length distribution obtained by this means are shown in 
Figure 5-36. Actually Figure 5-36 shows the percentage of the sum of the bubble chord 
lengths pierced by the probe’s central tip in each chord length class to the sum of all the 
bubble chord lengths pierced by the probe’s central tip obtained by the four-point probe. 

 
155
The shape of the distribution in Figure 5-36 is the same as the volume based bubble chord 
length distribution but in different scale. Actually the distribution in Figure 5-36 can be 
transferred to the volume based bubble chord length distribution can be obtained by 
multiplying the volume based local gas holdup (refer to Equation 4-10). However, the 
probe can only measure the time based gas holdup and the volume-based local gas holdup 
is unknown as explained in Section 4.3. 
 
It can be seen that the volume based bubble chord length distributions have the same 
shape as time based bubble chord length distributions (Figure 5-34). Hence, the above 
analysis based on time based bubble chord length distribution is valid for volume based 
bubble size distribution. Therefore, while all the bubbles that hit the central tip of the 
four-point probe contribute to the local gas holdup, the volume based bubble chord length 
distribution obtained by the probe (Figure 5-36) utilizes only those bubbles whose 
velocity can be determined by the probe. On the other hand, the time based bubble chord 
length distribution utilizes the whole bubble population because every time interval that 
the probe’s central tip spends in a bubble is employed in the derivation of the time based 
bubble chord length distribution. As described above, both of these distributions point to 
the same conclusion that the bubble size distribution is single modal in the range of 
operating conditions employed in this study.

5.9  The Mean Gas-Liquid Slip Velocity 
 
The local gas-liquid slip velocity is defined as the relative velocity between the bubble 
and the surrounding liquid phase. This parameter is important in Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD). When a bubble is moving in an infinite liquid phase, the slip velocity is 
equal to the bubble’s terminal rise velocity. In bubble columns, in the homogeneous 
regime, the slip velocity is less than or equal to the bubble’s terminal velocity, while in 
the heterogeneous regime, the slip velocity is larger than or equal to the bubble’s terminal 
velocity (Fan and Tsuchiya, 1990). 
 
By combining the local mean bubble velocity obtained by the four-point probe, 
b
v , and 
the local mean liquid velocity, 
lv , obtained by CARPT (Boon Cheng Ong, 2003), the 
local mean gas-liquid slip velocity can be obtained as 
l

. It is shown in Figure 
5-37 that the bubble slip velocity increases from the column center towards the wall zone, 
and it reaches the maximum at r/R=0.6 at all the operating conditions studied. In the wall 
zone, i.e., at r/R=0.9, the slip velocity is much smaller than in the core of the column. As 
shown before in this study the bubble size in the wall zone is smaller than that in the core 

 
157
of the column, and large bubbles usually have larger slip velocity than small bubbles. 
However, this is contrary to the observation that the slip velocity increases with r/R, since 
large bubbles tend to assemble in the central stream. Hence, in addition to the bubble 
size, there must be some other factors that affect the slip velocity, which, unfortunately, 
are unclear at present. 
 
Figure 5-37a shows that the radial profiles of the mean slip velocity for the three spargers 
used in this study are almost identical. Figure 5-37b shows that, for sparger #2 at 
Ug=30cm/s and 45 cm/s, the slip velocity at different radial positions is identical. Finally 
Figure 5-37c shows that the slip velocity obviously decreases with pressure. This is in 
accord with the fact that the bubble size decreases with pressure.

Figure 5-37.  Bubble Slip Velocity at Different Conditions 
 
As mentioned before, the values of the mean gas-liquid slip velocity obtained by the four-
point optical probe are valuable for CFD studies. However, such studies are beyond the 
scope of this study and will be followed up elsewhere.

Chapter 6  Conclusions and Future Work 
 
The following conclusions can be derived from this study: 
 
1. Two-point probes produce questionable results in systems having complex 
hydrodynamics, such as bubble columns, especially in transition and churn-turbulent flow 
regime. 
 
2. The four-point optical probe and the new data processing algorithm is a practical tool 
for investigating bubble properties in bubble columns. By validation against video 
imaging, it was proved that the bubble velocity distribution, bubble chord length 
distribution, local gas holdup, and specific interfacial area obtained by the new four-point 
optical probe algorithm are reliable. Difficulties exist in the measurements of bubbles of 
very low velocity approximating to zero. 
 
3. The four-point optical probe performed well both in bubbly flow and in highly churn-
turbulent flow at superficial gas velocity up to 60 cm/s and pressure up to 1.0 MPa. 
Bubble properties at these conditions in a 6.4” bubble column were measured for the first 
time, which are valuable for CFD validation and for development of engineering models. 
 
4. Some new findings about bubble properties in bubble columns are: 
 
(1). In bubbly flow, the radial profiles of specific interfacial area, bubble frequency, 
and mean bubble velocity are all flat. With an increase in superficial gas 
velocity, Ug, these profiles became more parabolic. In the column center, the 
bubble chord length distribution spreads wider with an increase in Ug. The mean 
bubble chord length increases with Ug until it is in deep churn-turbulent flow 
and then remains almost identical with Ug. In the wall region, the bubble chord 
length distribution does not change much with Ug. The mean bubble chord 

 
160
length in the wall region is much smaller than that in the column center, and it 
increases mildly with Ug between the bubbly flow and the transition flow 
regime, then decrease slightly with Ug. 
 
(2). At very low gas velocity, e.g. 2 cm/s, all bubbles move upwards in bubble 
column. In churn-turbulent flow (Ug>8cm/s), some bubbles move downwards 
even in the column center. In the wall region, the number of bubbles moving 
downwards is equal to or even larger than that of bubbles moving upwards. The 
percentage of bubbles moving downwards increases slowly with Ug in both the 
wall region and in the core of the column. In the wall region, the bubbles moving 
downwards are dragged down by the liquid, while in the core of the column the 
flow direction is generally upwards most of the time, and the bubbles moving 
downwards most likely come from the wakes of large bubbles and large 3D flow 
structures. 
 
(3). In bubbly flow, the bubble velocity distribution and bubble chord length 
distribution are alike at different radial positions, including the wall region. In 
churn-turbulent flow, in the core of the column the bubble velocity and chord 
length distributions are alike at different radial position, but in the wall region 
they are very different from the core of the column. 
 
(4). With an increase in pressure, the global liquid recirculation is enhanced, and the 
radial profiles of specific interfacial area, bubble frequency, and mean bubble 
velocity become more parabolic. The gas holdup increases with the axial position, 
possibly due to the accumulation of bubbles at the upper zone of the column at 
high pressure. The pressure effect is strong at 0.1 MPa, but it becomes weaker at 
pressures higher than 0.4 MPa. 
 
(5). Two of the three spargers used in this study, i.e. sparger#1 and sparger#3, 
generated similar bubble properties at the operating conditions employed, 

 
161
although their configurations are totally different. Sparger#2 generates somewhat 
different bubble properties than the other two spargers, though not to a significant 
extent. 
 
(6). In this study, the sparger effect disappears with an increase in the axial position in 
bubble column at z/D>5.1. However, at atmospheric pressure, the range of the 
sparger zone for the specific interfacial area is beyond z/D=5. Hence, the 
definition of the sparger zone based on gas holdup profiles may not apply to other 
bubble properties under some conditions. In other words, the range of the sparger 
zone for different bubble properties may be different. 
 
(7). The Sauter mean bubble diameter cannot be calculated without assumptions that 
are not met and it is subject to large errors. Qualitatively it can be used for 
comparison of “mean” bubble size at different conditions. 
 
(8). The bubble size distributions observed are single modal. Hence, the suggested 
bimodal bubble size distribution postulated for churn-turbulent flow was not 
detected. 
 
(9). In this study, the mean gas-liquid slip velocity is almost identical for different 
spargers and at different superficial gas velocities in churn-turbulent flow, it 
decreases with pressure, due to a decrease in the bubble size. 
 
Suggested future work to fully utilize the power of the four-point optical probe technique: 
 
1. Use bubble properties data obtained by the four-point optical probe for validation and 
refinement of CFD codes. 
 
2. Apply the four-point optical probe to a wider range of operating conditions, such as the 
superficial gas velocity, pressure, column diameter, and spargers, etc., to expand the 

 
162
bubble properties data base and get a better understanding of the hydrodynamics in 
bubble columns. Besides, apply the four-point optical probe to multiphase reactors other 
than bubble column, e.g., stirred tank reactors. 
 
3. Validate and apply the four-point probe in organic systems of industrial interest. In 
addition, apply the four-point probe at high temperature and pressure higher than 1.0 
MPa. Exploit the potential of the probe technique to detect phase transition at 
supercritical conditions (see Appendix E). 
 
4. Apply the probe in slurry bubble columns to test the durability of the probe against the 
collision of the particles. In the cases that the glass probe cannot stand long enough, e.g. 
systems with solid particles and high gas velocity, the plastic probe described in 
Appendix A should be used. 
 
5. Commercialize the four-point probe technique to provide a tool which is simple and 
easy to use for the on site measurements of bubble properties, e.g. monitor the quality of 
the flow in multiphase reactors.

Appendix A  The Plastic Fiber Optical Probe 
 
An optical fiber probe made of plastic fibers (Polymethyl Meta Acrylate) was also 
developed in this research according to the methods employed by Saito and Mudde 
(2001). The fabrication of the plastic fiber probe is almost the same as that of the glass 
fiber probe, except that the tip of the plastic fiber is cut into a wedge of 30o (Figure 
3.14a), which is the optimal angle determined by trail and error, instead of being made 
conical with a flame as in the case with the glass fiber. 
 
The plastic probe has the advantage over the glass probe that the size is small since there 
isn’t any protective cladding cover on it (the outer diameter of plastic fibers used is 
0.25mm, compared with 0.6mm for glass fibers). The smaller size of the probe reduces 
the disturbance of the probe to the flow field and makes the probe detects smaller 
bubbles. Furthermore, it is much more durable than the glass fiber probe due to the 
flexibility of the plastic fiber. Therefore, the plastic probe may be more suitable for use in 
slurry bubble columns where the glass probe may be broken by the particles in turbulent 
motion. 
 
It can be seen from Figure 3.14b that the output voltage of the plastic fiber probe is low 
when the tip is in a bubble, and it is high when the tip is in the liquid phase, which is 
contrary to that of a glass fiber probe. This is determined by the characteristic of the 
photoelectric multiplier used. The processing of the responses is the same as that for the 
glass optical probe. 
 
The disadvantages of the plastic fiber probe are: (1) It cannot endure high temperature 
(the permanent usage temperature of the plastic fiber used is 75oC). (2) Some organic 
solution may do harm to the plastic fiber, this limits its application in organic systems. 
And (3) the flexibility of the fiber makes it tremble in turbulent flow, this will cause 

 
164
errors in measurements. Moreover, the response of the plastic probe to a bubble is slower 
than that of a glass probe. This makes the front edge of its response to a bubble more 
inclined than that of a glass probe (Figure A-1).

Appendix B  Derivation of the Transformation 
Matrix 
 
The derivation of the transform matrix, A , in Equation (3-13) is shown as follows. 
 
As shown in Figure 3-14, the xyz coordinate system was transformed to the x’y’z’ system 
with z’-axis in the direction of the bubble velocity vector. This transformation can be 
accomplished with two rotations of the coordinate axes in xyz system: rotate angle ϕ 
around z axis and then rotate angle θ around y axis. Hence the rotation matrix, A , can be 
obtained as (Glassner, 1990):

Appendix C  The Natural Frequency of the 
Optical Probe 
 
To check the possibility of resonance of the glass optical probe in multiphase flow, the 
natural frequency of the probe was calculated. 
 
The formula for the natural frequency is (Condon and Odishaw, 1967): 
 
ρ
=
E
L
2
1
f
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(C-1) 
 
where f is the natural frequency, L and ρ are the length and the density of the object 
(probe), and E is the Youngs modulus of the material of which the object (probe) is made. 
 
The physical properties of the glass optical fiber used in this study are: L≈1.5cm, 
ρ=2.203 g/cm3, and E=5.8×109 Kg/m2. Hence, the natural frequency of the optical fiber is 
about 54 KHz, which is much higher than the bubble frequency in multiphase systems 
(usually in the range of 0~1000 Hz). Hence, the glass optical probe used in this study 
does not resonate in the bubble column flows.

Table D-2 and D-3 show that at high pressure the gas holdup obtained by the optical 
probe is always higher than that by CT, and the cross-sectional gas holdup obtained by 
the optical probe matches the overall gas holdup better than that by CT. Hence, at high 
pressure gas holdup obtained by the optical probe is still reliable. The reason for the large 
discrepancy in the gas holdup obtained by CT at high pressure is still unknown and is to 
be investigated.

D.2  The Effect of Superficial Gas Velocity 
 
Figure D-2 show the radial profiles of the bubble frequency at different Ug and its change 
with Ug. The radial profile of bubble frequency is flat in bubbly flow (Ug=2cm/s), and it 
is parabolic at Ug ≥ 8cm/s. From D-2b, it is obvious that the bubble frequent increases 
with Ug at all radial positions in the column.

Figure D-2. The Radial Profile of Bubble Frequency 
                    (Sparger #2, z/D=5.1) 
 
Figure D-3 shows the comparison of the bubble velocity distributions obtained by two-
point probes (use the central tip and one of the three peripheral tips of the four-point 
probe, e.g., Tip0 and Tip1 as shown in Figure 3-21) and by four-point probes. In bubbly 
flow (Ug=2 cm/s), as expected by the simulation (Figure 3-3a), the bubble velocity 
distribution obtained by two-point probe has higher pdf value at high value of velocity 
than by the four-point probe. This is more obvious in transition flow regime (Ug=8 cm/s, 
Figure D-3b). In churn-turbulent flow, the two-point probe cannot distinguish bubbles 
that move upwards and downwards, and it detects many bubbles of unreasonably high 
velocity (Figure D-3c and d). This is because at high gas holdup, due to the large number 
of bubbles in the bubble column, sometimes different bubbles hit the two tips of the two-
point probe almost simultaneously. The algorithm for the two-point probe considers this 
case the same as the case when the same bubble hits the two tips successively, and thus 
derives a very high bubble velocity. For four-point probe, the probability that several 
different bubbles hit the four tips of the probe almost simultaneously is very low. 
Furthermore, because the probe has more tips, more information about the bubbles that 
hit the probe can be derived so that many cases can be distinguished and discarded if 

 
174
needed. This is illustrated by the bubble velocity distribution obtained by the four-point 
probe in highly churn-turbulent flow (Figure D-3b). Hence, it is experimentally 
established that the bubble velocity distribution obtained by two-point probes is not 
reliable, especially in transition and churn-turbulent flow regime.

D.4  Transformation from Bubble Size Distribution to Bubble Chord Length 
Distribution 
 
Digital simulations were conducted to clarify whether a single modal bubble chord length 
distribution implies a single modal bubble size distribution. Figure D-4 shows examples 
of the bubble chord length distribution obtained by the four-point optical probe in a 
bubble column in churn-turbulent flow.

Figure D-4.  Volume Based Bubble Chord Lengths Distribution Obtained by 
Four-Point Optical Probe (r/R=0, z/D=5.1) 
 
To derive the bubble size distribution from the bubble chord length distribution, the 
bubble shape needs to be assumed. The assumptions made for the simulation are: (1) the 
bubbles are ellipsoidal, (2) the probe hits the bubble leading surface randomly, i.e. the 
probability that the probe tip hits every single point on the bubble leading edge is 
identical. 
 
When he probe tip randomly hits a bubble with minor axis, a, the chord length obtained 
will range from 0 to a. The probability density function (pdf) of bubble chord length 
distribution obtained is (Clark and Turton, 1988):

Assume that the bubble size (length of minor axis) distribution is bimodal, for small 
bubbles it is log-normal distribution and for large bubbles it is normal distribution, the 
bubble size distribution and bubble chord length distribution calculated are shown in 
Figure D-5.

In Figure D-5 from (a) to (d), the percentage of large bubbles in the whole bubble 
population increased. It is evident that when the bubble size distribution is bimodal, it is 
impossible for the bubble chord length distribution to have the shape shown in Figure D-
4. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the bubble chord length distributions obtained 
by the four-point optical probe in a bubble column, as shown in Figure D-4, infer single 
modal bubble size distributions at superficial gas velocity up to 60 cm/s.

Appendix E  Testing of Phase Transition At 
Subcritical and Supercritical Conditions Using 
Four-Point Optical Probe 
 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the four-point optical probe and 
the algorithm for data processing in stirred autoclave reactors and minireactors (this work 
was supported by the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Centers 
Program, Grant EEC-0310689). In addition, the suitability of such probe to provide 
transition information from two to single phase systems in expanded solvents will be 
assessed. This information is necessary for evaluation of the medium and the selection of 
the reactor type for the pilot plant and commercial implementation of the test bed reaction 
systems under investigation. 
 
The principle of the optical probe as explained in Section 3.2 makes it suitable for the 
detection of the transition of the n-decane-CO2 system from two phases to one phase 
(expanded solvent) with the increase in the pressure. The probe is going to be tested in a 
1 liter autoclave stirred reactor (Figure E-1) using organic liquid (n-decane) with sparged 
carbon dioxide. At subcritical condition, the CO2 will form bubbles in the n-decane phase 
and these bubbles can be detected by the optical probe. At supercritical conditions, the 
CO2 is miscible with organic solvent. Hence, there should be no bubbles detected. By this 
means, the transition from two phases to expanded solvent (CO2 supercritical phase 
systems) can be determined by the optical probe. The experimental conditions will be just 
above the critical temperature of CO2 (31oC), e.g. 35oC. The operating pressure will be 
0.1 to 10 MPa. Above 31oC and 7.28 MPa, the CO2 will be in supercritical condition. 
Hence, 35oC and 0.1~10 MPa include the critical point of CO2. 
 

 
182
It has been proved experimentally that the four-point optical probe worked efficiently at 
high pressure up to 10 MPa at about 40oC in the n-decane-CO2 system.

Appendix F  Derivation of The Bubble Size and 
Aspect Ratio 
 
An algorithm to derive the length of the bubble’s minor axis and the bubble’s aspect ratio 
based on the assumption that bubbles are ellipsoidal is suggested in Section 3.3 (Equation 
3-20).  Unfortunately, the validation of the probe’s measurements in a 2D bubble column 
(Figure 4-5) conducted in this study shows that the proposed algorithm based on solution 
of Equations (3-20a-d) does not give an accurate estimate of both aspect ratio and bubble 
size (Figure F-1). As illustrated in Figure F-1, the algorithm always underestimates the 
bubble aspect ratio (Figure F-1a) and overestimates the length of the bubble’s major axis 
(Figure F-1b). Furthermore, it is very sensitive to changes of the bubble chord lengths 
obtained by the probe, i.e., small changes in the bubble chord lengths may cause large 
variations in the calculated bubble size and aspect ratio. As a result, this method is not 
recommended to investigate the bubble size and aspect ratio in bubble columns.
