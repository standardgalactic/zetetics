INTRODUCTION
In recent years, methods of rational homotopy theory (especially Sullivan
models) have been applied successfully to symplectic geometry.
In particular,
these techniques have proved useful in attacking the Thurston- Weinstein prob-
lem of constructing symplectic manifolds with no Kahlerian structure (d. [AT2,
BG1, BG2, CFG, DFGM, FG1, FG2, FLS, Has, 01, Trl, Tr2]), certain cases of
Arnold's conjecture (cf. [02, MO]) and other geometric problems.
Concomitantly, some new and stimulating conjectures and problems have been
formulated in the last several years due to this influx of homotopical ideas. Ex-
amples include the Lupton-Oprea conjecture [L01] and the Benson-Uordoii con-
jecture [BG2], both of which are in the spirit of some older and still unsolved
problems (e.g.
Tliurston's conjecture and Sullivan's pToblem).
These results,
problems and conjectures are scattered in various research articles. In this work,
we intend to present them in a unified way, stressing qeometric techniques fla-
vored with the spice of homotopy theory.
Before starting our presentation, we emphasize some particular features of
this work.
Here, we collect a majority of known results on the problem of con-
structing symplectic manifolds with no Kahlerian structure. With this in mind,
nilmanifolds, solvmanifolds, fiber bundles and surgery techniques are discussed.
We also present some relevant homotopy theory, e.g. the Dolbeault raiionol ho-
m.otopy theoru. We give many examples with the aim of claryfying methods of
rational homotopy theory to geometers and attracting the attention of "ratio-
nalists" to some interesting geometric problems.
As an example of the latter,
we mention the existence theorems for symplectic fat bundles [ANT, TrK]. This
book is meant to be a kind of "bridge" for mathematicians working in two differ-
ent research areas, so we give proofs (especially geometric ones) of background
material where we can while simply providing motivation (and references) where
detailed proofs would bring the narrative to a halt. Our explicit aim is to clarify
the interrelations between certain aspects of symplectic geometry and homotopy
theory, so we try to present as much of the geometry "hidden" behind algebraic
calculations as possible.

CHAPTER 1
THE STARTING POINT: HOMOTOPY
PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
1. Differential Graded Algebras and Mimimal Models
The aim of this chapter is not to present a full-scale exposition of rational
homotopy theory, but to provide the geometrically-minded reader with enough
background in the subject to understand the applications which follow in later
chapters. The reader is referred to [GM, HI, Su, T] for many of the most technical
of details.
While we shall follow Sullivan's theory of minimal models [Su], we
recommend [T] to those who wish to learn the approaches of Quillen and Chen.
The work of De Rham [DR] in the 1920's has been fundamental to our under-
standing of the bond between the geometry and topology of smooth manifolds.
Recall that De Rham showed that the cohomology given by closed modulo exact
differential forms is precisely the same as that given by the then-new singular
cohomology theory (with real coefficients). Thus, differential forms hold within
them a crucial piece of homotopical information about the manifold.
In the
1950's, Thom and Whitney [Wh] (among others) seemed to believe more; that
forms hold all torsionfree homotopical information about the manifold. In the
1950's, however, homotopy theory was just coming to grips with the notion of
localization, so it was difficult to make this idea of torsionfree topology precise
enough to be linked to forms.
The 1960's and 70's saw the development of a
huge theory of localization in topology whose goal was to allow spaces to be
analyzed 'one prime at a time' (see [HMR] for example). In particular, the idea
of doing torsionfree homotopy theory gained the precise meaning of localizing
a space X to a space Xo via a map X
-+ Xo which induces isomorphisms on
homology H.(X) ® Q -+ H.(Xo;;Z) and homotopy 1l".(X) @ Q -+ 1l".(Xo), The
first major advance in understanding this torsionfree theory was the result of
Quillen [Q] that homotopy theory over Q is entirely algebraic; that is, any as-
pect of the rational homotopy type of a space could be understood within an
entirely algebraic category (e.g.
differential graded Lie algebras).
This led to
Sullivan's choice [Su] of a particular algebraic category in which to work, a cat-
egory in which the De Rham theory may be imitated to produce a convenient
(i.e. minimal) model describing the rational type of a space. It is to this theory
and some of its refinements, extensions and ramifications that we now turn.
Consider the category k-DGA of commutative graded differential algebras over
a field k of characteristic zero.
Thus, if (A, dA ) is such a differential graded
algebra, then A = EllAi is a graded vector space with multiplications AP @ Aq -+
Ap+q which are associative and commutative (in the graded sense);
a· b= (_I)lallblb. a

HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
where laf and fbi denote the degrees of a and b respectively in the underlying
graded vector space.
(Where convenient, we shall also denote the degree of a
homogeneous element a E Ai by deg(a) = i.)
The DGA A also possesses a
differential d: AP -+ AP+l which is a graded derivation
d(a. b) = (da)· b+ (_l)lala . (db)
satisfying d2 = 0 analogous to the exterior derivative for differential forms. If
(A, dA ) E k - DCA, we denote its cohomology algebra by H*(A, dA ) . A mor-
phism in the category k - DCA is simply an algebra homomorphism which com-
mutes with the differentials. The DGA (A, dA) is augmented if there is a DGA
homomorphism f
: A ---+ k such that Ker f contains all elements of positive degree
in A (denoted A" ). Generally, our DG A's will be augmented in a natural way.
The De Rham algebra offorms on a smooth (connected) manifold M, SlOR(M),
is augmented by the map on forms
SlOR(M) -+ lR =: SlOR(pt)
induced by the inclusion of a point into M, pt -+ M. The fact that
i- lR,
but HgR(M) == lR elicits the following definition. The DGA (A, dA ) is said to be
connected if AO = k and c­connected if HO(A, dA ) = k. The De Rham algebra of
a connected space is not connected, but is c-connected.
By definition, a differential graded algebra (M A , d) is called a model for
(A, dA ) if there exists a DGA-morphism
PA
: (M A , d) -+ (A, dA )
inducing an isomorphism on cohomology. If (M A , d) is freely generated in the
sense that M A = AV for a graded vector space V = EDVi, then it is called a free
model for (A, dA). Recall that the notation M A = AV means that, as a graded
algebra, M A is a polynomial algebra on even elements veven and an exterior
algebra on odd elements VOdd. (Note that a freely generated DGA is not 'free'
in the usual sense in the category k - DCA since the requirement that a DGA-
morphism commute with differentials precludes the immediate extension of an
arbitrary map from the generating set V to the whole DGA.) A morphism be-
tween DGA's inducing isomorphisms in cohomology is called a quasi­isomorpliism
and the algebras themselves are then said to be quasi­isomorphic.
Definition 1.1. A DGA (MA, d) is called a minimal model of (A, dA), if:
(i) (M A , d) = (AV, d) is a free model for (A, dA ) ;
(ii)
d is indecomposable in the following sense: there exists an ordering in
the set V of all free generators of MA, say, V = {x""
C\; E I} such that
x (3 < x", ==? deg(x(3) < deg(x",) and the expression for d(x",) contains
only generators x(3 < x",. For degree reasons, then, d(x",) is a polynomial
in generators xf3 with no linear part.
The decomposability criterion above has an equivalent formulation which is
apparent in the proof of

DIFFERENTIAL GRADED ALGEBRAS AND MIMIMAL MODELS
3
Theorem 1.2. [GM, LeI] For any c-connected (A, dA ) E k-DGA, there exists
a minimal model (MA, d).
Proof. We only give the proof in the 'simply connected case' H1(A, dA ) = a so
that the basic ideas are not obfuscated. Because we wish to mimic the cohomol-
ogy of A, we first define
M(O) = M(1) = rQ;
M(2) = M(I) ® A(V2)
where V 2 = H2(A), d(V2) = 0 and P2: M(2)
A is defined by taking vector
space splittings 0'0: rQ
HO(A) and 0'2: V 2 = H2(A)
z2(A) C A2 to the nat­
ural (surjective) projection of cocycles onto cohomology ZO ­=. HO(A) = rQ and
Z2(A)
H 2(A) respectively and then freely extending. Then, M(2) is clearly
minimal and the map P2 commutes with differentials (since d(V2) = 0), induces
cohomology isomorphisms through degree 2 and an injection on cohomology in
degree 3 (trivially, since M(2) has no elements of degree 3). These properties
form the basis of an inductive stage­by­stage construction of the minimal model
for A. Take as an inductive hypothesis that Pn : M(n)
A has been constructed
to satisfy
(1) M(n) is minimal
(2) Pn induces cohomology isomorphisms through degree n
(3) Pn induces an injection in cohomology in degree n + 1.
Let zn+l(A)
Hn+1(A) and zn+2(M(n))
Hn+2(M(n)) be projections of
cocycles to cohomology and let An+I
Image(d) C An+2 be the surjection of
An+1 onto degree n + 2 coboundaries (i.e. its image under the differential). Take
vector space splittings for each of these maps and denote them, respectively, by
I'n+2
Image(d) ­­­­­­t A n +l .
Now, let WI =
Hn+l(M(n))
Hn+1(A)) and W2 =
Hn+2(M(n)))
Hn+2(A). To continue the induction, we need to extend Pn to
a DGA map Pn+l : M(n + 1)
A such that
is an isomorphism through
degree n + 1 and is injective in degree n + 2. But W1 and W2 have been defined
to precisely achieve these requirements. Namely, define Vn+I = WI EtJ W2 and
M(n + 1) = M(n) C9 A(Vn +1)
with differential
{
dM(n)(V)
d(v) =
0
f'n+2 (v)
and Pn+1 : M(n + 1)
A defined by
for v E M(n)
for v E W1
for v E W2

4
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
for v E M(n)
for v E WI
for v E W2 .
It is easy to see that Pn+1 satisfies the inductive hypothesis. (In particular, note
that the third part of the definition of Pn+1 makes sense because v E W2 means
that [v] = 0 E H n +2(A), so v is a coboundary.) Thus, we can create n-models for
A, M(n), for all n. Upon taking the union MA = UM(n), the minimal model
for A is then constructed.

Example 1.3.
(1) Consider an even sphere s2n and its De Rham algebra flDR(S2n). To
create the minimal model for flDR(S2n) (which, remember, induces an
isomorphism on cohomology), we need a cocycle in degree 2n which
maps to the cocycle in flDR(S2n) representing the fundamental class of
s»,
Call this generator x and take the DGA freely generated by it,
(A(X2n), d= 0). Now (A(X2n),d= 0) itself maps to flDR(S2n) because
x freely generates it and, since x maps to a cocycle, the requirement
that the map commute with differentials is automatically satisfied. We
do not yet have a model for s2n since all higher powers of x represent
nontrivial cohomology classes in A(x) -
classes which do not exist in
H*(s2n). Thus these extra powers ofx must be killed by the addition of
a generator y in degree 4n-l with dy = x 2 . It is easy to see that defining
don y in this way kills all extra cohomology. Moreover, we can map y
to flDR(S2n) by taking it to zero. The minimal model of s2n is then
The definition of d on y is precisely the definition of the corresponding
k-invariant in the rational Postnikov tower for s2n and the existence of
generators only in degrees 2n and 4n -
1 reflects Serre's theorem that
even spheres have finite homotopy groups except in those degrees. We
shall make this precise below.
(2) Similarly, an odd dimensional sphere s2n-1 has a minimal model given
by (A(X2n-I), d = 0).
(3) Complex projective space has a minimal model which closely mimics
the cohomology generated by the symplectic cohomology class. Namely,
A(cpn)
=(A(X2, Y2n+I), dy = xn+I). In fact, the minimal model of cpn may be
constructed from the cohomology algebra alone -
an important prop-
erty in rational homotopy.
(4) The minimal model of a torus is A(Tn ) = (A(XI, ... ,xn ) , d = 0) where
each generator has degree IXil = l.
At the end of Example 1.3 (1), we hinted that the minimal model contains
more information in it than simply the cohomology of a space.
In order to

DIFFERENTIAL GRADED ALGEBRAS AND MIMIMAL MODELS

relate minimal models to homotopy theory (and more specifically, to localization)
directly, we need a DGA over (ll to replace the De Rham algebra. In [Su], Sullivan
created exactly such a DGA called the DGA of rational polynomial forms A;'L'
Let
n be a standard simplex in IPI.n +1 ,
n
= {(to, ... , tn) 10::; t; ::; 1, Lti = I},
i=O
and let (] denote the boundary operator. Consider the restriction to
n of all
differential forms in IPI.n+1 of the form
L
cPi,ikdti, /\ ... /\ dti k
where cPi,.ik are polynomials of to, . . . ,tn over the rationals. Denote the set of
all such forms by A*
and note that there are two relations in this algebra:
n
n
Lti = 1
and
Ldti = O.
i=O
i=O
Let X
be a simplicial complex (with a constituent simplex denoted by o).
Define
A;'dX) = {(w")"EXIw" E A*(o), and w<7lr = W r if T
00"}.
It can be verified that A;'dX) is a DGA if we use the standard multiplication and
differentiation on forms componentwise. Let C*(X) be the complex of simplicial
cochains over the rationals. Then the following theorem holds (analogous to the
usual result for the De Rham complex).
Theorem 1.4 [GM, Lei], (P.L. De Rham theorem). There is a map of
complexes
p : A*(X) -> C*(X),
inducing an isomorphism in cohomology
The P.L. de Rham theorem shows that cohomological information is contained
in A;'L(X) and, therefore, in its minimal model MA;'L(X). However, the role of
the minimal model is much more important as we will see.
Definition 1.5. Let X be any simplicial complex. Define the minimal model of
X to be the minimal model of A;'L (X);
(Mx, d)
(MA;'L(X), d)
Remark 1.6. In fact, P.L. forms can be defined, along with the minimal model, for
any CW complex, say. The process consists of taking the singular complex of the
space and treating it as a simplicial set amenable to the P.L. form construction.
With the foregoing as background, we can now state the fundamental theorem
of rational homotopy theory.

6
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Theorem 1. 7. Each path-connected space X has a minimal model (Mx, d) =
(AV, d) and, for nilpotent spaces, the stage by stage construction precisely mir-
rors the rational Postnikov tower with the differential corresponding to the k-
invariant.
This correspondence between nilpotent spaces and minimal models
induces a categorical equivalence between the category of homotopy types of
nilpotent spaces with morphisms the homotopy classes of maps and the category
of isomorphism classes of minimal models with morphisms the DGA-homotopy
classes of DGA maps.
There are several notions in the theorem which we have not yet discussed. In
particular, we have not talked about Postnikov towers -
and we will not except
to say that a Postnikov tower is a stage-by-stage construction of the homotopy
type of a space from principal fibrations of a special type.
In fact, when we
discuss nilmanifolds in Chapter 2, we will actually construct a Postnikov Tower
without knowing it! We have also not talked about the idea of DGA homotopy,
but this will be discussed in §2. The one concept mentioned in the theorem which
will have the greatest bearing on our work is the concept of nilpotent space. A
space X is nilpotent if its fundamental group 1Tl (X) is a nilpotent group and
the natural action of 1Tl(X) on 1Tn(X) is a nilpotent action. Since this notion of
nilpotent action will arise several times in this book, it pays to recall the formal
definition.
Definition 1.8. (see [HMR] for example) Let A be an abelian group and let G
be a group with a homomorphism ¢: G --+ Aut(A). That is, G acts on A through
¢ and we denote the action by ¢(g)(a) = g. a. Define a lower central ¢ series by
= A and, for i 2 1,
rif,+l(A) = group generated by{g . a - a I9 E G, a E
Then, the action of G on A is nilpotent if
(A) = {1} for some N.
Remark 1.9.
(1) If A is not abelian, then a slightly more complicated expression for
must be used. Namely,
rif,+l(A) = ((g. a)ba-1b- 1 I9 E G, a E
bE A).
where (
) denotes the 'group generated by'. This expression clearly
reduces to the previous one (written multiplicatively) in the abelian case.
Also, if A = G and the action is by conjugation, then
= ri(A)
for all i, where ri(A) is the usual lower central series term for A. In this
case, a nilpotent action is simply saying that the group A is nilpotent.
(2) In topology, the fundamental group of a space often acts on homotopical
objects associated to the space.
For instance, let X
be a space with
universal cover X. It is well known that 1Tl (X)
Cov(X), the group
of covering transformations of the covering X --+ X. Now, because X is
simply connected, the set of free homotopy classes of self-maps of X is in

DIFFERENTIAL GRADED ALGEBRAS AND MIMIMAL MODELS
7
bijection with the set of based homotopy classes of basepoint preserving
self-maps of X.
This means that to every homotopy class of covering
transformations corresponds a homotopy class of self-maps (which are,
in fact, homotopy equivalences) X ----> X. These maps provide induced
automorphisms of homotopy groups 7I"j(X) == 7I"j(X) (i > 1) and this
whole process then provides an action of 71"1 (X) on 7I"j(X) for all i. (Of
course,
71"1 (X) acts on itself by conjugation.) A space is nilpotent if this
action is a nilpotent action. The importance of the notion arises from the
fact that nilpotent spaces have 'Postnikov towers' so that, in principle,
their homotopy types can be understood stage-by-stage.
Hence, the
connection with the minimal model construction.
(3) It is also the case that, for a fibration (e.g. fiber bundle) F
----> E
----> B,
7I"l(B) acts on H.(F).
This action arises from the homotopy lifting
property of fibrations as follows. Consider the diagram
DB x F x 0
---->
E
1
1
w
DB x F x I
---+
B
where DB denotes the space of based loops on B, the top row embeds
F in E and w(iT, i, t) = iT(t). The homotopy lifting property then says
that the homotopy W may be lifted to a homotopy w: DB x F x I ----> E
with Wo the embedding of the top row. Also, since W1 (iT, f) = bo (i.e. the
basepoint), commutativity of the diagram implies that W1: DB x F
----> F
with adjoint W1: DB
----> FF.
Taking path components (using 71"0), we
obtain a map
where [F, F] denotes the free homotopy classes of self-maps of F. This
process gives the action of
71"1 (B) on H. (F) by taking induced homo-
morphisms of self-maps in the image of ¢. Note that we do not usually
obtain an action of 71"1 (B) on 71". (F) because free homotopy classes may
have several based classes which project to them. A fibration for which
71"1 (B) acts nilpotently on H.( F) is called a quasi-nilpotent fibration.
Exam.pIe 1.10.
(1) Any simply connected space is trivially nilpotent.
(2) Any K(7I",1) with
71" nilpotent is a nilpotent space. (Recall that a space
X is a K(7I", n) if 7I"n(X) = 71" and 7I"j(X) = 0 for all i :{:. n.) Thus, in
this case, the nilpotency condition is fulfilled because first, nilpotency is
assumed for
71" and secondly, there are no higher homotopy groups for
71"
to act upon. In Chapter 2, we shall see that nilmanifolds are special cases
of this example. Solvmanifolds, however, are not nilpotent spaces and
this is a major complication in analyzing their homotopical properties.

8
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Theorem 1.7 is then saying that, for a nilpotent space, the minimal model is
a perfect reflection of the rational homotopy type of the space -
that is, of the
localization Xo. For instance, for i > 1, Vi '== Hom( 7ri (X), Q), where 7ri (X) is the
i t h homotopy group of X. The minimal model (AV, d) is therefore an algebraic
version of the Q-localization of X, X o. Now, it also must be noted that the
categorical equivalence of Theorem 1.7 implies that a map of spaces I: Y --+ Z
induces (in the usual fashion) a map of forms 1*: A*(Z) --+ A*(Y) and a map of
minimal models (AVz, dz) --+ (AVy, dy) unique up to DGA-homotopy. We shall
explore this in more detail in §2.
2. DGA-Homotopy and Invariance of Minimal Models
In this section, we will examine some properties of minimal models including
their uniqueness up to isomorphism. In order to understand this, we first look at
what means for two DGA maps to be 'homotopic'. Of course, we should always
keep Theorem 1.7 in mind. What we are actually doing is understanding how
the notion of homotopy translates from spaces to DGA's, thereby becoming an
essential ingredient in the categorical equivalence between homotopy types and
minimal models.
Let M
= (AX, d) be a freely generated DGA which has the property that
d(xoJ E AX<a' This is weaker than saying that M is minimal since the differ-
ential may have linear parts, but it still says that M is constructed in stages and
this will be all we need at the moment. Let {Xl, X2, ... ,Xi, ... } be a basis for
X. Now, a homotopy between maps of spaces, I, g: X
--+ Y, is a map
H: X x 1--+ Y
with
H(x, 0) = I(x), H(x, 1) = g(x).
A basepointed homotopy requires that H(xo, t) = Yo for all t E [0,1] and for fixed
basepoints Xo and Yo of X and Y respectively. Homotopy is denoted I
g. The
adjoint version of all this is as follows: define two evaluation maps, Ao, Al : YI
--+

Ao(r) = reO),
Al(r) = r(I)
where y I is the function space of maps from the unit interval to Y (with the
compact-open topology). Then, as the reader can check, I
g: X
--+ Y if and
only if there exists a map K : X --+ Y I such that
Ao 0 K = I
and
Al 0 K = g.
The adjoint formulation of homotopy then becomes the model for a notion of
DGA homotopy. With M as above, define
I
M = (AX ® AX ® AdX, d) = (A(x;, X;, dXi), d)
with differential d given by

and augmentation
E obtained from the augmentation of AX and the obvious
augmentation of the contractible DGA (AX (>9 AdX, d). Here, IXil = IXil - 1.
There is a degree -1 derivation, denoted i, defined on M 1 by
i(Xi) = Xi,
i(x;) = a= i(dxi)
with i 2 = O.
The degree a derivation () = di + id may be defined then and,
for each graded vector space degree, there exists some N such that ()N = O.
Therefore, we don't have to worry about convergence properties when we make

Check that the last equality holds by the definitions and properties of d and i.
The mapping e9 is an automorphism of M 1 (with inverse e- 9 ) and de 9 = e9d.
Let AO, A1 : M -t M 1 denote the respective inclusions
Definition 2.1. Two DCA maps t, g: M
-t N are (DGA)-homotoplc if there
exists a DCA map H: M 1 -t N with H 0 AO = f and H 0 A1 = g. Two DCA
maps I, g: M
-t N are based (DGA)-homotoplc if there exists a DCA map
H: M 1 -t N which preserves augmentations with H 0 AO = f and H 0 A1 = g.
We have written AO and A1 applied to generators because that is what we
usually do in practice to test whether maps are homotopic. However, note right
away that e9 is an automorphism of the DGA M 1 , so it may be applied to any
element. In particular, if x is any cocycle of M, then (id)n(x) =afor all n > O.
Hence, if maps f and g are homotopic by H, then
HA1(X) = HAo(x) + H(dx)
g(x) = f(x) + dH(x)
g(x) - f(x) = dH(x).
Thus, on cocycles, homotopic maps differ by coboundaries.
In other words,
homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism on cohomology -
just as they
should. Further, although we shall not prove the following result, it provides the
key to understanding rational homotopy theory algebraically.

HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Theorem 2.2. [HI, Property 15.12] Homotopic maps of spaces induce homo-
topic DCA maps of minimal models.
Indeed, by the general theory (see Theorem 1.7), for localizations at zero X o and
Yo with respective minimal models Mx and My, there is a bijection of sets of
homotopy classes
[Xo,Yo] == [My,Mx].
Note that the correspondence is a contravariant one just as for forms and coho-
mology.
Instead of giving a proof of this result, we shall show how induced maps of
minimal models arise. First, let's simplify our notation a bit by writing
00 (idt
O(Xi) ='" ­(Xi)
LJ
n!
n=l
so that Al(X;) = Xi + dXi + O(Xi)'
It is sometimes convenient to write x; for
AI(Xi) as well. Also, since a DGA homotopy is defined on M, it is often more
convenient to define the homotopy on each end, Xi and x;, to begin with as
opposed to Xi, xi and dXi. With this in mind, note the following
Lemma 2.3. (A(Xi, Xi, dXi), d) = (A(Xi, x;, Xi), d).
Proof We need only show that dx may be obtained from generators {Xi, x;, X;}.
If xi is in the first stage of the construction, then O(Xi) = 0 and dXi = x; ­ Xi.
Assume inductively that dXj may be obtained for all Xi through stage k, say.
Then, for Xi in stage k + 1, dXi = x; ­
Xi ­ O(Xi)'
But, by the inductive
assumption, O(x;) may be obtained from the new generating set (since it is
decomposable). Hence, so can dXi.

Now, in order to see how spatial maps translate into maps of models, we
will develop an obstruction theory for models (see [Mor] and [GM]). This theory
plays a roughly analogous role to that of ordinary obstruction theory in homotopy
theory. As a warm­up, consider
Proposition 2.4. Let f: M
­+ A be a DCA map and suppose that M
is
extended to a DCA Nt = M
(9 AV with d(V) C M
for some vector space in
degree n V = (Xl, ... ,Xk). Then the obstructions to extending f to a DCA map
1: Nt ­+ A are cohomology classes [j(dXi)] E H n +1(A), i = 1, ... , k.
Proof First, if j exists, then f(dxi) = dj(x;) , so j(Xi) is a coboundary and
[f(dxi)] = O. Secondly, suppose that [j(dXi)] = O. Then there exists a E A with
da = f(dx;). Define j(Xi) = a so that the extension j is obtained with dj = fd.
o
Remark 2.5. An extension Nt as above is sometimes called an elementary ex-
tension or a Hirsch extension, the latter in honor of Guy Hirsch who pioneered
DGA methods in fibration theory around 1950.

Consider now a more complicated situation corresponding to the homotopy
lifting property for fibrations. Namely, consider the DGA homotopy commutative
diagram
M

where M ®AV = M as above and ¢>f c::!i via a homotopy H: M 1 -+ B. There
is the following
Lifting Problem 2.6. When does there exist an extension 1: M -+ A such
that ¢>1 c:: ! (where the homotopy fI extends H as well)?
In order to formulate an answer to this question, recall that to any cochain
map of cochain complexes (e.g.
a DGA map) ¢>: A -+ B, there is a cochain
complex C(¢» = {C n(¢», d} called the algebraic mapping cone of ¢> with
and differential d(a, b) = (-da, db + ¢>(a)) (where the differentials inside the
parenthesis are those of A and B). It is easy to check that d2 = 0 and that there
is a long exact sequence in cohomology
where j: B" -+ Cn+l(¢»
is the obvious inclusion and p: Cn+l(¢»
-+ An+l is the
obvious projection. With this device, we can now prove
Theorem 2.7. The obstructions to the existence of1: M -+ A and it . M1 -+
B in the lifting problem are cohomology classes
[-f(dx;), /(x;) - H(D(x;))] E Hn+l(C(¢»).
Proof. We first show that (- fdx;, !x; - HDx;) is a cocycle. For this, recall that
)'1(x;) = x; + dx; + D(x;)
= AO(Xi) + dXi + D(x;)
so that dD(xi) = dAl(X;) - dAo(x;) = (Al - AO)(dxi)' Now, by the definition of

12
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
DGA homotopy, H >"0 = rjJf and H >"1 = fi, so
d(- fdxi,!Xi - Ho'Xi) = (dfdxi' dfxi - dHo'Xi - rjJfdxi)
=(Jd2xi, fdxi - H do'Xi - rjJfdxi)
= (0, fdxi - H(>"1 - >"O)(dXi) - rjJfdxi)
= (0, fdXi - fdxi + rjJfdxi - rjJfdxi)
= (0,0).
Now suppose that! and H exist. Then we have
d(jXi' HXi) = (-d!Xi, dHxi + rjJ!x;)
=(-!dXi, H dXi + rjJ!Xi)
=(-fdxi,!Xi - rjJ!Xi - HnXi + rjJXi)
since dXi is decomposable and! restricts to f on M. Then
d(jXi, HXi) = (-fdxi,!Xi - Ho'Xi)
since o'Xi is decomposable and H restricts to H on M. Therefore, if ! and H
exist, then the obstruction cocycles (- fdxi, f Xi - Ho'Xi) are coboundaries and
so zero elements in Hn+l(C(rjJ)).
Conversely, suppose that [- fdxi, fXi -
Ho'Xi] = °in Hn+l(C(rjJ)).
Then
there exists (a, b) such that d(a, b) = (-da, db + rjJa) = (- [ti», ,!Xi - Ho'Xi).
Hence, da = [d», and db+rjJa= fXi - Ho'Xi. Now define !Xi = a and note that
d!Xi = da = fdxi. Also, using Lemma 2.3, define H by
{
HIM= H
HXi = rjJXi
I! >"1 Xi = fXi
HXi = b
and note that dH>"IXi = dfxi = fdxi = H)Ildxi. Finally, then,
sits; = db = fXi - Ho'Xi - rjJ!Xi = H(>I1Xi -
>"OXi - o'Xi) = ita«;
Thus, the vanishing of the obstruction class allows the extensions! and H to be
defined.

Corollary 2.8.
(1) If 1; is a quasi-isomorphism, then 1 and if exist.
(2) If 1; is a surjective quasi-isomorphism and 1;f = f, then 1may be chosen
so that Ii = f and 1;1 =f.
Proof For (1), simply note that the hypothesis implies that H*(C(¢)) = 0 using
the long exact cohomology sequence associated to the algebraic mapping cone.
Hence, all obstructions to lifting vanish.
For (2), because ¢f = fi, we may
choose the original homotopy H to satisfy H y = ¢ fy, H >'1 Y = fy and H f) = 0
for all generators y in M. In particular, the last equality says that HD(y) = 0
for all y as well, so the obstruction classes (which vanish by (1)) are [- fdxi, jx;].
Now, since [-fdxi,JXi] = 0 and ¢ is assumed to be a quasi-isomorphism, there
exists (a, b) with d(a, b) = (-da, db+ ¢a) =(- fdxi ,JXi)' Hence, da = fdxi and
db+ ¢a = j Xi. Because ¢ is assumed to be surjective, there is an a' E A with
¢a' = b. Then fXi = ¢(a + da') and we may define
l xi=a+da'.
Thus, djXi = da = [d», and ¢lxi = j Xi, so the lifting j induces strict commu-
tativity in the diagram.

The results above allow us to model maps as well as spaces. Indeed, in the
following theorem, the map F is called a model for the DGA map f: A -+ B.
The construction of F follows from Corollary 2.8 taking ¢ = PB and using the
fact that the minimal model MA is built in stages by Hirsch extensions.

Example 2.10.
(1) Let
53 -+ 52 be the Hopf map. Because
is a fibration, the induced
map on forms (either polynomial or De Rham), C: A*(52 ) -+ A*(53), is
injective. Of course, 53 has no degree 2 cohomology, so the image of 5 2's
volume form must be exact, C(V2) = d(3, and this should be reflected in
the model. Indeed, it is easy to see that C V2 1\ (3 is a non-exact closed
form in A*(53) and so generates H 3(5 3) ==' 22:. In fact, 53 is a contact
manifold and (3 is a contact form on 53 and C V2 1\ (3 is a true volume
form on 53. Also, it is well known that
is a generator for 11"3(52 ) ==' 22:
and this too should be visible in the model.
Recall that the minimal models for 52 and 53 are M S2 = A(X2, Y3)
with dx = 0, dy = x 2 and M S 3 = A(Z3) with dz = O. Here, subscripts

14
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
refer to the degrees of the corresponding generators.
Since M 53 has
no elements in degree 2, there is no choice for the model map E but
that :=:(x) = 0. Now, if :=:(y) = °too, then the general correspondence
between minimal models and rational homotopy would say that
is
homotopically trivial -
which is false.
Thus, :=:(y) is some nonzero
multiple of z. Because the map on generators of the minimal models is
supposed to reflect the induced map on rational homotopy groups and
represents the generator of 7T3(5'2), we must have :=:(y) = z. In order
to check all this, we note several facts: (1) For the minimal model map
P52, we have P52(X) = V2 and P52(Y) = 0- the latter since 5'2 has no
forms above degree 2. (2) For P53, we may define P53(Z) = -CV2/\(3
since we only need to induce an isomorphism on cohomology.
We now have two composite mappings f,g: M52 --+ A*(5'3) with
f(x) =C V2 ,
f(y) = 0,
g(x) = 0,
g(y) =-C V2 /\ (3.
To define a homotopy H:
--+ A*(5'3), We first write
M 1
A(
"
. -)
52 =
x,y,x,y ,x,y
=A(x,y,x,y,dx,dy)
with differential most easily defined on the latter set of generators
dx = 0, dy = x2 , d(x) = dx, d(f}) = df}
and d2 = °of course.
Then, using the definitions of x'
y' = eBy,
dx = x' - x
and
df} = y' - y - xx - xx'
where the reader can verify that O(y) = 2xx + xdx = xx + xx'. Now, H
may be defined on each 'end' by
H(x)
H(x')
.::, V2,
0,
H(y)
H(y')
but what should the definitions of H(x) and H(f}) be? The only restric-
tion is that H must be a DGA map. That is, we require dH(x) = H(dx)
and dH(f}) = H(df}). In fact, this is always the crucial point in the con-
struction of any DCA homotopy. In order to see what these relations
mean, we compute

INVARIANCE OF MINIMAL MODELS
H(dx) = H(x') - H(x)
H(dy) = H(y') - H(y) - H(x)H(x) - H(x)H(x')
=-c 1/2 1\ (3 - °- H (X)c 1/2 - °
=-c 1/2 1\ (3 - H(X)c 1/2 .
15
Clearly, if we define H(x) = -(3, then we obtain dH(x) = H(dx). Then,
if we define H(y) = 0, we obtain from above,
by graded commutativity since C 1/2 has even degree.
Plainly this is
dH(y) also and H has been constructed. Therefore, on minimal models,
the model S of the Hopf map
is given by S(x) = 0, S(y) = z.
(2) Hopf's Theorem states that the set of homotopy classes [X, sn] of maps
from a complex of dimension n to an n-sphere is in bijection with
Hn(X; Z;:). The usual proof is by obstruction theory. If n is odd, then
the minimal model of S" is A(zn) with dz = 0. A map Xo -+ So then
corresponds to a DGA map A(z) ........ AV where Mx = (AV, d).
But,
since dz = 0, z can go to any n-cocycle in Mx and the map is deter-
mined by this cocycle. Hence, there is a surjection zn(Mx) -+ [Xo,So],
Furthermore, if f and 9 are two maps with f(z) = 0: and g(z) =(3, then
Msn = A(z, z', z)
with
dz = z' - z
and the existence of a homotopy H with H(dz) = dH(Z) is equivalent
to the cocycles 0: and (3 differing by an exact form (i.e. dH(z) = (3-
0:).
Thus, the homotopy relation corresponds to exactness in zn(M x) and,
so, Hn(X; Q) == [Xo,So]. We leave it to the reader to handle the case
of an even sphere.
We have given the examples above in great detail only to illustrate the idea
of DGA homotopy.
Of course, it is too much to hope that more complicated
examples can be analyzed so explicitly. Nevertheless, the general existence results
are quite powerful as we shall see. One point that we have neglected, but which
is essential, is the uniqueness of the minimal model. How can we hope to model
maps, for instance, if we don't have some sort of 'fixed' models for our DGA
maps to transform? In order to understand uniqueness properties of the minimal
model, we need the following result (which we prove along the lines of [GM]).
Theorem 2.11. If ¢ : M
-+ N is a quasi-isomorphism of minimal DGA's, then
¢; is a DGA isomorphism.
To prove this 'minimality' result, we first require the following

16
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Lemma 2.12. Let M
== (AV, d) and M(n) == (A(EBi<nVi),d) with inclusion
j: M(n) '-+ M. Then, ifC(j) denotes the algebraic mapping cone of j,
Proof. Note that (-a, b) E C(j) is a cocycle when both da == 0 and db == a (where
we neglect writing j(a) for convenience since j is an inclusion). For such a cocycle
with b E M n+l , there is a unique vector space decomposition b = bl + b2 where
b: E vn+1 and b2 E M(n)n+l. Define
8: zn+2(C(j)) --+ V n+1
by 8(-a, b) == bl . We first show that 8 is surjective. Let b E V n+1 and note that
(-db, b) E zn+2(C(j)) with 8(-db, b) == b. Note that db E M(nt+ 2 here.
We now show that Ker(8) = Bn+2(C(j)), the n + 2-coboundaries of C(j).
First, for d(-a, b) E Bn+2 (C(j)),
B(d(-a, b)) == 8(-da, db - a) == 0
since a E M(n)n+2 by definition and db E M(n)n+2 since d(Vn+1 c M(n)n+2
Hence, B n +2(C(j)) C Ker(8). Now suppose 8(-a, b) == O. Then, by the definition
ofB, it must be the case that bE M(n)n+1 and, hence, (b, 0) E M(n)n+IEBM n ==
cn+I(j) with
d(b, 0) == (-db, b) == (-a, b) E B n+2(C(j»
since (-a, b) is a cocycle (so db == a). Therefore
is an isomorphism.

[-1J(dv),1J(v)]
This composition is then 1J# as well. With this in mind, we can now give the
proof of Theorem 2.11.
Proof of Theorem 2.11. Assume by induction that the quasi-isomorphism 1J in-
duces an isomorphism of the DGA's M(n) and N(n) and consider the ladder of
algebraic mapping cone cohomology sequences

The first and fourth vertical arrows are isomorphisms by the inductive hypothesis,
so the middle vertical arrow is an isomorphism by the 5-Lemma. As above, the
middle arrow may be identified with the map on indecomposables 1J#: V n+1 -+
W n+l . Hence, the restriction of 1J to
M(n + 1) = M(n) 0 AVn+1 -+ N(n) 0 AWn+1 = N(n + 1)
is an isomorphism as well. By induction we then find that 1J is an isomorphism
M-+N.

Remark 2.15. The general theory of minimal models (see Theorem 1.7) says that
the induced map on indecomposables of the minimal model of a space is precisely
the transposed linear transformation of the mapping on rational homotopy vector
spaces induced by a spatial map. Theorem 2.11 can be thought of then as an
algebraic version of the Hurewicz and Whitehead theorems in homotopy theory.
Also, for non-simply connected nilpotent spaces, it is necessary to identify the
stages of the model required to build the model in degree 1 with certain quotients
involving the upper central series of the fundamental group to truly understand
the induced mapping.
Corollary 2.16. The minimal model is unique up to isomorphism.
Proof. Suppose PI : M I -+ A and P2: M 2 -+ A are minimal models of a DGA
A. Form the diagram

and note that a lift
T exists because P2 is a quasi-isomorphism and M 1 is con-
structed by elementary extensions (in fact, is minimal), The homotopy commu-
tativity of the diagram and the fact that both PI and P2 are quasi-isomorphisms
imply that T is a quasi-isomorphism as well. But Theorem 2.11 then says that T
is an isomorphism since M 1 and M 2 are minimal.

3. Formality and Kahler Manifolds
A minimal differential graded algebra (AV, d) is called formal if there is a
DGA homomorphism 'ljJ: (AV, d) ----> H*(AV, d) which induces an isomorphism on
cohomology, A space is called formal if its minimal model is formal, Note that,
by composing with 'ljJ* -1, we may take the homomorphism to be the identity
on cohomology, Formality is a very important property of a space because, in
principle, it allows all rational homotopy information to be gleaned from the
cohomology algebra, Indeed, it can be argued that all of (Sullivan's version of)
rational homotopy theory arose from the intutive belief that Kahler manifolds
are formal, But we shall talk more of this later. For the moment, let us try to
understand this idea of formality in a more computational way, We will use the
following criterion for formality.
Theorem 3.1. [DGMS, Theorem 4,1] A minimal DG algebra (AV, d) is formal
if and only if V decomposes as a direct sum V = C!:B N with d(C) = 0 and
d injective on N such tluu. every closed element in the ideal generated by N is
exact,
Proof. Suppose first that V = C Ef7 N with d(C) = 0 and every closed element
in the ideal generated by N is exact. This says that all cohomology of (AV, d)
comes from the subalgebra AC where C = !:BCi consists of all generators which
are cocycles. Define a linear map 'ljJ: Vi
----> H*(AV,d) by
{
'ljJ(c) = [c]
'ljJ( n) = 0
for c E C i
for n E N i
Extending freely to (AV), we see that 'ljJ is injective on AC and zero on Ideal(N),
Clearly,
'ljJ dc =
0 =
d'ljJc since de = 0 in (AV, d) and d = 0 constantly in
H*(AV, d), In order for 'ljJ to be a DGA homomorphism, however, we must still
show that 'ljJ dn = d'ljJn as well. Again, d = 0 in H *(AV, d), so the righthand side
is zero, Therefore we must show 'ljJ dn = 0 too,
Let dn = r + s where r E AC and s E Ideal(N), Then 0 = d2n = dr + ds =
0+ ds since r E AC and we see that ds = 0, But s E Ideal(N), so the property
above implies that s = dt for some t. But then r = d(n - t), so r is exact with
'ljJ(1') = [1'] = 0 and
1/;(dn) = 1/;(1') + 1/;(s)
=0+0
=0

FORMALITY AND KAHLER MANIFOLDS

since 1.j; is zero on Ideal(N). Thus 1.j; commutes with the differentials and, there-
fore, is a DGA homomorphism. Because the cohomology is generated by C, 1.j;
induces the identity on cohomology.
Now suppose that (AV,d) is formal; that is, there exists
1.j;: (AV,d) --+ H*(AV,d)
with 1.j;* the identity. First, let's focus on the minimal model MH of the DGA
(H* (AV, d), d = 0). Recall from the construction of the minimal model in Theo-
rem 1.2 that, for the (n + 1)­st stage, we define
MH(n + 1) = MH(n) !Xl A(Vn+l )
where V n +1 = WI EB Wz with differential d zero on WI and injective on Wz (de-
signed to kill excessive cohomology in degree n+ 2). Further, pn+1: MH (n+ 1) --+
(H*(AV, d), d = 0) maps WI injectively into cocycles to create a cohomology iso-
morphism and maps Wz into elements which will be coboundaries in degree n+2.
But, for (H*(AV, d), d = 0), the vanishing of the differential implies that there
are no coboundaries and that every element is a cocycle. Hence, Pn+1 (Wz) = 0
and Pn+1 is surjective. Inductively, we have a surjection p: MH
--+ H* (AV, d)
which satisfies p(WD = 0 for all i. In the notation of the theorem then,
Moreover, if ex E Ideal(N), then clearly p(ex) = O. If do = 0, then this means
that p*([ex]) = 0 as well. But p" is an isomorphism, so it must be the case that
[ex] = 0 E H*(M H ) . This of course means that ex is a coboundary ex = d{3 for
some {3. Hence the criterion of the theorem is satisfied for MH·
Now, because p is a surjective quasi­isomorphism, by Corollary 2.8 (2), there
is a strictly commutative diagram
(AV, d)
MH
1 p
H*(AV,d)
where cf; is an isomorphism by Theorem 2.11.
Let ut = cf;-I(W{) and
=
Then, since cf;# is an isomorphism, we see that AV = AU where
U i = ut EB
Now, it is plain that, in AU,
Let ex E Ideal(N) with dex = O. Then ¢(ex) E Ideal(NH) and d¢(ex) = 0 (since
cf; commutes with differentials). Since MH satisfies the criterion of the theorem,
there exists a {3 with d{3 = cf;(o ). But ¢ is an isomorphism, so there is a , E AU
with cf;(J) = {3. Consequently, d, = (}' and AU = AV satisfies the criterion as
well.
Remark 3.2. The criterion of Theorem 3.1 due to Deligne­Griffiths­Morgan-
Sullivan is a way of saying that all Massey products vanish simultaneously. By

20
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
this we mean that choices can be made for Massey representatives such that all
Massey products are zero (see Section 6 of this chapter).
Example 3.3.
(1) Spheres are formal; odd spheres trivially so and even spheres by a simple
application of the criterion with C = (x), N = (y). It is also easy to
construct a quasi-isomorphism 1/J: Msn --+ H* (sn) directly.
(2) A similar argument shows that all complex projective spaces are formal.
(3) A theorem of Halperin (see [GHV, H2J) says that all homogeneous spaces
of maximal rank are formal spaces.
This theorem will be proved in
Chapter 5 (see 5.4.16).
(4) If a space X has cohomology freely generated (i.e. polynomial on evens
and exterior on odds), then there is an embedding H*(X) <-+ A*(X)
taking generators to representative cocycles and extending freely. This
map is a quasi-isomorphism and H*(X) is trivially minimal. By unique-
ness of models, Mx
H*(X), so X is a formal space. In particular,
Hopf's theorem on H -spaces (e.g.
Lie groups) says that H -spaces have
freely generated cohomology algebras. Hence, all H -spaces are formal.
(5) It is fairly easy to show that products and wedges of formal spaces are
formal.
(6)
Not any graded differential algebra is formal. An explanation of this is
obvious: a morphism which can give formality must be defined for all
elements of the given algebra and be the identity on cocycles. These two
conditions may not be compatible. Examples of formal and non-formal
algebras are contained in [L01], [Tr l] (see Section 6 of this chapter).
Massey products [Kr] constitute obstructions to formality [DGMS] as we
have already mentioned (for more details see Section 6). A good illus-
tration of the formality property coming from geometry is the following
result.
Theorem. [GM] Any compact Riemannian symmetric space is
formal.
Proof. Consider the linear map
p: H*(M) --+ rlDR(M),
p([uJ) = W u ,
where W u is a unzque harmonic representative (whose existence
is guaranteed by Hodge theory).
It is well known that, for a
Riemannian symmetric space, harmonic = left-invariant with
respect to the isometry group action. But the product in the de
Rham algebra of invariant forms is again an invariant form in
rlDR(M) and therefore p is a morphism in ffi;-DOA inducing an
isomorphism in cohomology. The basic lifting result Corollary
2.8 guarantees a map MM --+ H*(M) which must be a quasi-
isomorphism. Hence, M is formal.

FORMALITY AND KAHLER MANIFOLDS
21
The main examples of formal spaces in this book, and, indeed, the most
complicated interesting examples in general, are Kahler manifolds. Let's recall
some geometric facts about symplectic and Kahler manifolds before we consider
the question of formality.
A manifold M 2n is symplectic if it possesses a nondegenerate 2-form w which
is closed (i.e. dw = 0). The symplectic manifold is then denoted (M 2n,w). The
nondegeneracy condition is equivalent to saying that w n is a true volume form
(i.e. nonzero at each point) on M. Furthermore, the nondegeneracy of w sets up
an isomorphism between I-forms and vector fields on M by assigning to a vector
field X the l-forrn ixw = w(X, -). Good references for all these ideas are [Aul],
[AM], [AuL].
The most important theorem about symplectic manifolds says that all symplectic
manifolds locally look like !PI.2n.
'I'heor-em 3.4: Darboux's Theorem. Around each point in a symplectic man-
ifold (M 2k , w) there are local coordinates (Xl, ... ,xk , yl , ... ,yk) such that
k
w =L dxi 1\ dyi .
i=1
Again, this result says that symplectic manifolds have no local distinguishing
invariants.
In other words, all symplectic manifolds look alike locally.
In this
sense then, symplectic geometry is a global subject.
Example 3.5. Symplectic geometry is the natural framework for Hamiltonian
mechanics. Given a smooth function R: M -+!PI. (i.e. the Hamiltonian), let X H
be the vector field on M determined by the isomorphism between I-forms and
vector fields,
iXHw = dH,
Take Darboux coordinates (qi, Pi) (in the cotangent notation) so that w = L dq' 1\
dp, and
X
"
'i 0
".
0
H = L.J q oqi + L.J Pj OPj
where Ii and Pj are tangent vectors to the integral curves of XH. Now, the forms
of wand XH immediately give
oR
OPi
and
These are Hamilton's equations of course, so the symplectic form is seen as pro-
viding the proper theoretical avenue for studying mechanics. Also, because of the

22
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
final form of the equations, a Hamiltonian system may be written in coordinates
(XI, ... ,Xk),
Example 3.6.
(1) For any manifold M k , the cotangent bundle T* M is a symplectic man-
ifold with symplectic form defined as follows.
Let p: T* M
­> M be
the cotangent projection and take the induced map on tangent bundles
Tp: T(T* M) ­> TM. Then, for e; E T* M and r E T{3=(T* M), define
a l­forrn (the Liouville form) pointwise on T* M by
and then globally by
(J: T* M ­> T* (T* M)
In local coordinates (ql, ... , s", PI, ... , Pk), where the qi's come from M
and the Pj 's come from T* M, we have e= 2:=:=1 Pi dq' with exact 2­form
k
W = -de = Ldqi 1\ dpi.
i=1
(2) The first example specializes to the case
= (xl, . . . , x k, yl , ... , yk)
with symplectic form w = 2:=:=1 dxi 1\ dyi. Then, since the symplectic
form is invariant under translations xi f­t xi + 27r and yi f­t yi + 27r, the
form induces a symplectic form on the orbit space T 2k =
/712k.
(3) If G is a compact Lie group, then it acts on the dual of its Lie algebra
g* by the coadjoint action. It is a fact that the orbits of this action are
always symplectic manifolds. For instance, the coadjoint action of 50(3)
on 80(3) ==
actually corresponds to rotation in
so the orbits of
the action are 2­spheres of varying radii. Of course, 2­spheres (as well
as all oriented surfaces) are symplectic.
(4)
Let cek be complex k­space with the Hermitian inner product
k
(z,w)=Lziwi
i=1
where z = (Zl, ... ,zk) and w = (WI, ... ,wk) are in cek . If we write
zi = xi + iyi and wi = u.i + ivi, then
k

The first term is the standard dot product in ]R!.2k. The second term is
alternating, so is a 2-form on
]R!.2k. Define w =
yiui - xivi to be
this 2-form. Then w is closed and non degenerate and Ck is symplectic.
(5) The previous example may be generalized as follows.
Let M denote a
complex k-manifold endowed with a Hermitian metric (in local analytic
coordinates (z I, ... ,zk)
k
h =L hijdz dz.
i=1
Writing dzi = dxi + i dyi and dzJ = dxj - i dyi, we can expand the
expression above into its real and imaginary parts to get
h = 9 + iw
where 9 is a Riemannian metric on M and w is a 2-form (which must be
nondegenerate as the alternating part of a Hermitian form). The 2-form
w may be written as
.

w=--

Then, if w is closed, M is said to be a J( dhler manifold.
By what we
have said above, all Kahler manifolds are symplectic. The reverse is not
the case as we shall see.
Examples of Kahler manifolds include Cp k
for all k as well as all smooth projective varieties.
In the latter case,
the 2-form w is obtained as the pullback of the Kahler form of Cpk via
the inclusion. A compact Kahler manifold M 2k has the beautiful Hard
Lefschetz Property which says (in part) that multiplication by powers
of the Kahler cohomology class, also denoted by w, induce cohomology
isomorphisms
wj : Hk-j(M;!JJ) -=-. Hk+J(M;Q).
Furthermore, because forms on a Kahler manifold decompose into holo-
morphic and anti-holomorphic parts, there is a (p, q) decomposition on
cohomology with
Hp,q(M;Q) == Hq,P(M;Q)
so that Hn(M; Q) = ffip+q=nHP,q(M; Q). The isomorphism above then
shows that, since odd numbers have symmetric partitions into two num-
bers, in odd degrees, the dimension of cohomology must be even. In even
degrees, because w j ¥- 0, the cohomology of a compact Kahler mani-
fold is always nonzero. Finally, a deep analysis of Kahler metrics shows
that they possess the following property: any identity involving only the
metric and its first derivatives holds on a Kahler manifold of complex
dimension n if and only if it holds on Cn . In this sense, Kahler man-
ifolds are complex manifolds whose geometry reduces to linear algebra
(see [ABCKT], Metatheorem 1.2).

24
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
As we shall see later, it is not true that every symplectic manifold is a formal
space.
However, it has long been known that the extra strength of the Kahler
assumption is very powerful indeed.
Theorem 3.7. [DG MS] Compact Kahler manifolds are formal spaces.
In order to better understand how geometry relates to rational homotopy
properties such as formality, we will give an outline of the proof of Theorem
3.7.
Also, note that cohomology properties alone are not sufficient to ensure
formality, even in the case of spaces which are cohomologically Kahler. That is,
there are examples of spaces with the cohomology of known Kahler manifolds
which are not formal [Lu]. Thus, geometry plays an essential role here. The key
to the proof of the theorem is a lemma which relies strongly on the metric and
form properties of Kahler manifolds. In particular, the almost complex structure
J associated to the complex manifold structure of a Kahler manifold allows the
definition of another 'exterior derivative on real forms',
dC
r:' dJ
with the property that ddc = -s:« Of course dc 2 = 0 by dc 2 = J- I d J J- 1 d J =
J- I d 2 J = 0 since d 2 = O.
Furthermore, for a Kahler manifold, the Hodge
Laplacians of d and de are related by
d d'i-Lemma 3.8. [DGMS] If M is a compact Kahler manifold and 0: is a form
with do: = 0, dCo: = 0 and either 0: = dfJ or 0: = dCfJ, then for some"
0: = ddc, = -dcd,.
Sketch of Proof. Take the case where
0: = dfJ. From the Hodge decomposition
of forms, 0: has no harmonic part, so
where Cd is the Green's operator associated to
and d* is the formal adjoint to
d (which may be defined explicitly by the Hodge star operator). Since
=
and 0: has no d-harmonic part, then
0: has no dC-harmonic part as well. Thus,
0: = dCdc*CdeO:. Now the special commutation identities associated to a Kahler
manifold may be used to obtain
o
Proof of Theorem 3.7. Let OC M = Ker dCand HdcM = H*(OM, dC), where OM
denotes the usual de Rham complex. There is a diagram
(Hdc, d) <--- (OCM,d) ---+ (OM,d)

FORMALITY AND KAHLER MANIFOLDS
25
where we note that the left side is truly a complex because of the relation dd" =
-dcd. Moreover, the first thing we can see is that d = 0 on HdeM. To see this,
let [a] E Hae and apply the ddc Lemma to do: That is, dCda = -ddca = 0 since
[a] E Hae, dda = 0 since d2 = 0 and do is d-exact by definition. Therefore, the
ddc-Lemma says that
do = ddcl = dC(-dl).
Hence, do is dC-exact, so [da] = 0 E HaeM and d = 0 on IIaeM.
Now let's use this to show that p* is an isomorphism.
Let [a] E HaeM, so
that dea = O. As above, apply the dd" Lemma to do to get do = ddcl. Then
d(a - dCI) = 0 so that [a - dCI] E H*(DC M, d) and p*([a - del]) = [a] since
[dCI] = 0 in HaeM.
Thus p* is surjective.
Now suppose that p*([a]) = O.
Then a = de(3 and, applying the dd" Lemma to a gives a = ddcl , so that
[a] = 0 E H*(DC M, d). Thus p* is injective as well.
The induced map i* is an isomorphism as well.
For let [a] E H*(D, d) =
H*(M; JR) (so that da = 0) and apply the dd" Lemma to d
Ca to get d
Ca = ddcl .
Now let (3 = a + dl and compute
Hence (3 E DeM and i*([(3]) = i* ([a])+i*([dl]) = [a], so i* is surjective. Suppose
i*([a]) = 0 so that a = d(3. Since a E DC, dCa = 0 as well, so the dd" Lemma
implies that a = ddcl . Now del E DC M, so a is dC-exact in DcM and [a] = O.
Hence, i* is injective also.
Note that, since d = 0 on HaeM, we must have HaeM == H*(M;JR).
This
may also be seen by Hodge theory since the d and d
C Laplacians agree. Because
p* and i* are isomorphisms, the DGA-homotopy commutative diagram
HaeM

induces lifts to minimal models M 2
--+ M] and M 2 --+ (AV, d) which must be
cohomology isomorphisms as well. But, by Theorem 2.11, cohomology isomor-
phisms of minimal DGA's are actually isomorphisms.
Hence, there is a map
inducing a cohomology isomorphism (AV,d)
--+ HaeM == H*(M;JR) and M is
formal.

As an aside, it should be noted that, while A*(M) is a more natural DGA
in regards to homotopy theory, for a smooth manifold M, the De Rham algebra
DDR(M) is more natural geometrically. We can relate these algebras as follows.
Smoothly triangulate M and obtain polynomial forms ApL(M). Then we have
Theorem 3.9. [LeI] The following isomorphism holds:

HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
As far as we know, the first discussion concerning the existence of symplectic
compact manifolds with no Kahler structure appeared in the paper of W.P.
Thurston [Th] who attributed it to A. Weinstein. This problem was discussed
in [We] in some detail. Thus, it seems to be reasonable to call this problem the
Thurston- Weinstein problem.
Problem 3.10 (Thurston-Weinstein). Are there compact symplectic mani-
folds carrying no Kahler structure?
We will discuss this problem in detail later.
In the years 1984-1996 many
examples appeared [BGl, BG2, CFG, FGl, FG2, FLS, DFILM, Gmf, Has, McDl,
Th, Tr2, Tr3].
Essentially there are two main techniques producing examples:
rational homotopy theory (which is our main concern here) and surgery (Gompf-
McDuff [Gmf, McD 1]).
Our main goal is to understand the role of rational
homotopy theory in constructing symplectic manifolds with no Kahler structure.
We consider various classes of symplectic manifolds: nilmanifolds, solvmanifolds
and fat bundles and give solutions of the Thurston-Weinstein problem in these
classes.
From the algebraic point of view, a substantial part of this work is devoted to
cohomologically symplectic and Lefschetz algebras.
Definition 3.11. A graded differential algebra (A, dA ) is called cohomologically
symplectic if:
(i) H*(A, dA ) =
satisfies Poincare duality and
(ii)
there exists an element w E A 2 such that for [w] E H 2(A ,dA ) , [wV f- 0
for all k = 0, ... , n.
Definition 3.12. A graded differential algebra (A, dA ) is called Lefschetz (or
satisfies the Hard Lefschetz condition) ifit is cohomologically symplectic and the
corresponding element w satisfies the condition: a linear map
is an isomorphism. In this case we call w a Lefschetz element.
Of course a compact symplectic manifold has a De Rham algebra and minimal
model which are cohomologically symplectic and a compact Kahler manifold has
a De Rham algebra and minimal model which are Lefschetz algebras.
Remark 3.13. We won't prove here the Hard Lefschetz Condition referring in-
stead to [GrH] (cf., however, the proof of Theorem 1.4 in Chapter 6).
On the
other hand, an explanation of cohomological symplecticness is quite simple. In-
deed, let w E 0lm(M) be a symplectic form on a closed 2n-dimensional manifold
M. We have already mentioned that w n is a true volume form. Assume that on
the cohomology level [w]n = O. This means that wn = dB for some differential
(2n - I)-form. By Stokes's theorem, however,
r w n = r dB = r

with the lefthand side of the above equalities being non-zero (since it equals the
volume of M).
Because M is closed, its boundary is empty and the righthand
side vanishes. This contradiction shows that [wt -# 0 so that a closed symplectic
manifold is automatically cohomologically symplectic.
From the geometric point of view, this work is devoted to the study of certain
geometric structures on compact smooth manifolds: symplectic, Kdhlerian, com-
plex, almost complex, and Riemannian symmetric space structures. For brevity's
sake, we must assume the reader to be familiar with basic definitions and facts
related to these structures; we refer to [AuL, KN] and try to keep notation and
terminology close to the standard sources (e.g. [KN] and [AuL]).
4. Rational Homotopy of Fibrations
Because fibrations (e.g. fiber bundles) provide one of the best ways to con-
struct interesting new spaces out of old ones, it is important to understand how
to analyze fibrations from the viewpoint of rational homotopy. As we have seen
previously, given a fibration p: E
----+ B, we can form the minimal model map
P: Mn
----+ ME and consider various algebraic properties of it. This approach
is not entirely satisfactory, however, because it does not allow an analysis of the
fiber.
Therefore, a different approach, akin to the original construction of the
minimal model itself, has been developed. We begin with the algebraic technical
details [HI] of the approach and then show how these are related to the geometric
problem of analyzing fibrations.
Following S. Halperin [HI], we consider the category k­DGA of graded com-
mutative differential algebras over a field k of characteristic zero.
We consider
only augmented graded algebras.
Definition 4.1.
[HI] An extension is a sequence of augmented commutative
graded differential algebras
(B, dB)

such that i and p preserve augmentations and the following conditions are satis-
fied:

obviously obey this condition).

by A<a and As:a the subalgebras generated by X{3 with (3 < a (resp. (3::; a) and

Definition 4.2. [HI]
(i) An extension (1) is called a KS-extension if it admits a homogeneous
basis {xa}aEI of X indexed by a well-ordered set I such that
dc(xa) E B iZI A<a, a E I.
(ii) A KS-extension is called minimal if there is a homogeneous basis {xa} aEI
satisfying the conditions of (i) and such that
(thus, the ordering with respect to degrees is compatible with the order
in 1).
Theorem 4.3 (Halperin). [HI] Let (B, dB) and (E, dE) be c-connected and
let
be a morphism in k-DGA. There exists a minimal KS-extension (1) such that
the following diagram of morphisms commutes
(E, dE)

where r.p is a quasi-isomorphism.
Proof The proof of this theorem is, in a sense, a modification of the classical
existence theorem (i.e. Theorem 1.2) for usual minimal models. Indeed, one can
try to mimic the original proofs in [GM, Lei] and we give an outline of this below.
Consider the map l' : (B, dB)
--+ (E, dE) and denote by B iZI A(x)<n a graded
algebra which is a tensor product of tr» and a free graded algebra A(X)<n,
where tr» C B denotes the subalgebra in B generated by elements of degrees
< nand A(X)<n is generated over a vector space X<n of elements of degrees
< n. We want to perform the proof by induction with respect to the grading on
E. We claim that there exists a chain of KS-extensions
... (BiZlA(x)<n,d<n) C BiZlA(x)<n+l,d<n+l)
and k-DGA-morphisms

such that 'PnIB0A(X)<n-l = 'Pn-l and the
are isomorphisms on cohomology
through degree n and are injective in degree n + 1. Note the similarity with the
inductive hypothesis of Theorem 1.2.
We start the induction with the obvious case of n = 0 and assume that the
chain (2) is already built for degrees < n. To construct B®A(x)<n+l we require
vector spaces: X; such that
B ® A(x)<n+l = EBp<n+lA:Sn+l eX) A(X;).
As in the proof of Theorem 1.2, define
W2 = Ker(Hn+1(B ® A(x)<n) -----+ Hn+1(E)).
Let
= W{' EB W2 and extend the corresponding derivation to
by setting
{
d<n+l(I ® w) = 0
for wE W{'
d<n+l(I ® y) E Z(B ® A(x))<n
representing y E W2.
Again, use induction and assume that
are defined for all q < p and the
derivation d<n+l and a morphism 'Pn are extended to B 0 A(x)<n ®
so
as to satisfy the required conditions on the cohomology level. Then, for p 2:: 1,
set
x; = Ker(Hn+1(B ® A(x)<n eX)
and extend d/:" to X; so that
d<n+l(1 eX) x) E B eX) (x)<n Q9
is a cocycle representing x, x E X;. The extension of 'Pn+l is obvious. It can be
verified that 'Pn+l is a quasi-isomorphism through degree n and is injective on
cohomology in degree n + 1. This calculation is more or less straightforward but
rather long (see [HI]). The final step is to take direct limits of extensions (2) and
note that the required quasi-isomorphism has the 'Pn+l'S above as restrictions.
o
It is also proved in [HI] that a KS-extension (1) is unique in a suitable sense.
We refer to [H1] for details.
Halperin's theorem can be applied to calculations of minimal models of Serre
fibmtions. The idea of the construction below is due to Sullivan [Su], but it is
rather difficult to find a single reference which includes a self-contained proof.
Below, we sketch some of the constructions occuring in the proof and we refer
to [H1] for technical details.
We hope that this exposition will be useful for a
geometer who wants to learn more about models of fibrations.

where, again, the bottom row is a minimal KS-extension obtained by applying
Theorem 4.3 to the natural map

Now, observe that the right arrows zn both rows of the diagram are surjections
which are identities on A(X) and A(Y) respectively. Therefore, the diagram may
be completed by a natural DGA-map

By [HI], since the leftmost vertical arrows are quasi-isomorphisms, then so is Q.
By Theorem 2.11,
Q is then an isomorphism.

the algebras ApL(M), ApL(E) and ApdF). We refer to ([HI], Chapters 14-20,

follows. Let j : F -+ E be the inclusion. Then 7r 0 j is a constant map F -+ {*}

action of 7rl(M) on H*(F). This refinement is due to Y. Felix and J.C. Thomas
[FTJ.
Theorem 4.6 [FT]. Let F
E -. M be a fibration and let U denote the
largest 7rl(M)-submodule of H*(F) on which 7rl(M) acts nilpotently. Assume
that the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) H*(F) is a vector space offinite type;
(ii) M is a nilpotent space (i.e.
7rl(M) is a nilpotent group which acts
nilpotentlyon 7ri(M) for all i > I).
Then, in the KS-model of the fibration,

the DCA homomorphism a: (AX, dx ) ->
induces an isomorphism
a*: H*(AX,dx) -=. U.
Note that for a nilpotent (or quasi-nilpotent) fibration, the original Grivel-
Halperin-Thomas theorem is recovered.
We shall make extensive use of the
Felix-Thomas result below when we deal with a prime example of a non-nilpotent
action, the (Mostow) fibration associated to a solvmanifold.
As a glimpse of
things to come, we offer
Example 4.7: The Klein Bottle. One of the simplest examples of a solvman-
ifold is the Klein bottle K. The Mostow fibration associated to the Klein bottle
IS

with
71"1 (81 ) = Z acting on HI (81 ) = Z as the neqatiue of the identity.
This
action is clearly non-nilpotent so that U = {O}.
Theorem 4.5 then gives the
rational (or real) cohomology of the Klein bottle as that of a circle.
Of course
this agrees with standard calculations.
5. An Illustrative Geornetric Example
One of the first applications of minimal models to geometry was a solution
to the problem of closed geodesics on simply connected manifolds. Recall that
Gromoll and Meyer [GrM] had shown the following.
Theorem 5.1. [GrM] Let M 5' denote the free loop space of M consisting of all
continuous maps from the circle to M (with the compact open topology). If the
Betti numbers of M
5 1 form an unbounded sequence, then there are an infinite
number of geometrically distinct periodic geodesics on M.
Using iQ-minimal models, Sullivan and Vigue [VS] were able to derive the follow-
ing equivalence.
Theorem 5.2. [VS] Let M be a simply connected closed manifold. The follow-
ing are equivalent.
(l) The sequence of Betti numbers of the free loop space M 51 is unbounded.
(2) The iQ­cohomology algebra of M requires at least two generators.
Thus, if the iQ­cohomology algebra of M requires at least two generators, then
M has an infinite number of geometrically distinct periodic geodesics.
It is not our purpose here to describe the commutative algebra of the Sullivan-
Vigue approach and prove their result. Rather, we would like to give a careful
development of the minimal model of the free loop space. This model is not only
important for the closed geodesic problem, but has proved in recent years to be
the basis for an understanding of rational Hochschilcl and cyclic homologies [BV],
[ATl]. Our approach is a specialization of a more general discussion in [GHVi].
In our calculations, we will often refer back to the fundamental pullback diagram
below.

HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Here, M I is the mapping space of continuous maps from the unit interval I to
M and 1r is defined by 1r(13) = (,8(0), ,8(1)).
Also, the map
is the diagonal
= (m, m). The map 1r is a fibration with fiber the (based) loop space OM
consisting of basepoint preserving maps from 8 1 to M. Note that q is a fibration
since 1r is and that there is a section 05: M -+ M S ' of q given by o5(m) = W m , the
constant loop at m EM. This section splits the long exact homotopy sequence
of the fibration q into short exact sequences. Hence, for all i,
S'
1r;(M
) = 1r;(M) EB 1r;(OM).
This section 05 will prove important to us. Recall that to the minimal model of M
is (MM, d) = (AV, d) there is associated a DCA (Mit, d) = (A(VEBVEBdV), d) =
(A(V EB V' EB V), d) (where Vi = Al (v)) which plays an essential role in defining
DCA homotopy. When we first defined this DCA, we gave the analogy to the
adjoint formulation of ordinary spatial homotopy. In fact, however, there is more
than just an analogy here.
Proposition 5.3. The DCA Mit is a (non-minimal) model for the space M I ,
Proof. First note that the Kiinneth theorem implies that M x M has minimal
model
which we will simply denote by (A(V EB V), d). Consider the diagram

for v in the second copy of V
Denote the composition II a i by f-l and note this is essentially multiplication
AV ® AV -+ AV. Now, referring to (t), we see that 1r a (J a 05 =

ing Sullivan's functor A p L (denoted A for convenience), we have A((Jo5) A(1r) =

Hence, A(1r(Jo5) is multiplication as well and the diagram above
is commutative.
Now, (Jo5 is a section of the fibration

where PM is the path space of M consisting of maps (3: I -> M with (3(0) = rna
(the basepoint of M). Of course the projection M I -> M is simply given by (3 f-+
/3(0). It is easy to see that PM is contractible so that 0-05 is a homotopy equiva-
lence with (0-05)* an isomorphism. Therefore, the 'lifting theorem' Corollary 2.8
says that, in the diagram above, there is a lift of pIT: A(V EB V' EB V) -> ApdM)
to
1/;: A(V EB V' EB V) -> ApL(M1)
with A(o-s)1/; = pIT and 1/;i = A(7l')(p C'J p).
(Specifically, the lifting is already
defined on V and V', so that only V provides obstructions and these are trivial
since (0-05)* is an isomorphism.) By changing generators, we may take IT to be
defined by
IT(v) = v,
IT(v) = 0,
IT(dv) = 0
so that IT is clearly a quasi­isomorphism. Since the same is true for p and A(o-s),
then 1/; is as well.

A(j)1/;i = A(j)A( 71' )(p C'J p)
= A(7l'j)(p C'J p)
= O.
Therefore, Ker(p) = Ideal(V ffi V') C Ker(A(j)1/;), so there is a map
with ¢p = A(j)1/;.
But i is a KS extension (by construction) which models
the fibration
71' (by the commutativity of the diagram and the fact that
1jJ is
a quasi­isomorphism), so by Theorem 4.4, ¢ is a quasi­isomorphism as well and
(AV, d = 0) is a minimal model for OM. This says that the minimal model of the
loop space OM is given by a copy V of the generating set V, but graded so that
Ivl = Ivl- 1 together with zero differential. By Theorem 1.7, this is saying that

36
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
the cohomology of the loop space is generated by the homotopy of the original
space. All this can also be seen from Example 3.3 (4) assuming Hopf's theorem
on H -spaces.
Now let r: A(V EB V' EB 11) --+ A(V EB 11) be defined by
r(v)=v,
r(v')=v,
r(v)=v.
The question is, how should a differential D be defined in A(V EB 11) so that
rd = Dr? Consider
r(dv) = r(v' - v - fl(v))
= v - v - r(fl(v))
= -r(fl(v))
where fl(v) is as in the discussion of DGA homotopy (see after Theorem 2.2).
Clearly, to obtain rd = Dr, we should define
D(v) = dv
and
D(v) = -r(fl(v)).
Now, define
by
B(v) = f3(v')
and
B(v) = f3(v)
where f3 = A(O')'l/' (for 0': M S '

The right square commutes because, first of all, cPp(v) == 0 and, on v E V,
A(jl)O(V)
== 0 since O(v)
== A(q)p(v) and A(h)A(q) == A(qjd
== A(*)
== 0;
secondly, we have
cPp(v) == A(j)1f;(v)
== A(h)A(o-)1f;(v)
== A(jJ)jJ(v)
== A(jJ)O(v).
We must still check that 0 is a DGA map and this is accomplished by noting
that, clearly, dO(v) == 0D(v) and
dO(v) == djJ(v)
== dA(o-)1f;(v)
== A(o-)1j!(dv)
== A(o-)1f;(v' - v - n(v))
== A(o-)1j!(v' - v) - A(o-)1f;(n(v))
== A(q)pJ.1(v' - v) - jJ(n(v))
== -jJ(n(v))
since Vi - v E Ker(J.1)
== O(-r(n(v)))
== OD(v).
Therefore, the diagram is commutative and it is clear that the top row is a KS
extension. Furthermore, there are spectral sequences associated to each row and
comparison maps between them with p and cP quasi-isomorphisms. Hence, 0 is a
quasi-isomorphism as well. We have
Theorem 5.4. If (MM, d) == (AV, d) is the minimal model for M, then the
minimal model for the free loop space M S ' is given by
(A(VEElV),D)
with
D(v)==dv
and
D(v)==-idv
where i is the derivation i(v) == v, i(v) == O.
Proof. The discussion above has shown that (A(V EEl V), D) is a minimal model
for the free loop space with Dv == dv and Dii == -r(n(v)). We will show that
the description of D in the theorem is equivalent to this. If Ivl == 2, then dv == 0,
so n(v) == 0 == idv.
Assume D(u) == -idu for all generators u with lui < Ivl.
Equivalently, for these u, we assume Di + id == O. Now, ri == ir and rd == Dr, so
r(O(v)) == r
(V))
==
(v).

38
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
Then, since dv is decomposable into polynomials involving u's and Di + id =:: °
on these u's, we have
Di(Dv) =:: Di(dv)
== -id(dv)
== -i(d2(v))
== 0.
Hence, the only nonzero term in r(O( v)) is the first one iDv == idv and, so,
D(v)=::-idv.
0
Remark 5.5. The reader may now show that the minimal model for the path
space PM is given by
(A(V ffi V), V)
with differential defined by
V(v)=::dv
and
V(v)==v-1'(O(v))
where 1': A(V EB VI ffi V) --+ A(V ffi V) is given by
1'(v) =::0,
1'(vl)=::v,
1'(v)=v.

Example 5.6. Let M = 52. Then M52 = (A(x,y),d) with Ixl == 2, Iyl = 3,
dx =°and dy = x 2 . Theorem 5.4 then gives the minimal model of 5 2 5 ' to be
(A(x, X, y, y), D) with
Dx = 0,
Dx = 0,
Dy = x 2 ,
Dy = -2xx.
Note that the cocycles X, z , xy and xy+2yx are cohomology generators in degrees
1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. We can use this low degree information to determine
the cohomology algebra of the free loop space completely. Write
H*(S2) = Poly(w)j(w2)
and
H*(052) == Exterior(u) ® Poly(v)

where Iwl = Ivl = 2 and lui = 1. The fibration
39
has a spectral sequence with a two column E 2-t erm . Hence, the spectral sequence
collapses to E 2 , so we can determine the cohomology algebra of the free loop space
at this level (see [McC]). The picture of the E 2-t erm is as follows.

that u survives to 00.
Hence, d2(u) = 0 and w must survive as well.
Now, x
represents the only nontrivial class in H 2(82 S ' ) , so wand v cannot both survive.
Thus, d2 ( v) = uw and, by multiplicativity,
Hence, we obtain
Note that dim(Hi ) = 1 for all i and that all cup products are zero. Nevertheless,
the free loop space of 8 2 is not formal because there are a tremendous number
of Massey products such as xii and xii + 2yx.
Note also that 52 is the prime
example of a manifold which does not fall under the hypotheses of Theorem 5.2.
Indeed, it is only recently that the infinity of closed geodesics has been proved
for 8 2 in any metric (by geometric rather than topological means).

6. Higher Order Massey Products
We have already discussed (very briefly) the role of Massey products as ob-
structions to formality. However, since they are used essentially in constructing
symplectic manifolds without Kahler structures (see Chapters 3, 5 and 6), we
present this material here in a more systematic and computational way for the
reader's convenience.
Results on Massey products are scattered mainly in re-
search papers and we hope that the reader will find this presentation useful.
For simplicity, we will proceed further, introducing successively triple Massey
products, quadruple Massey products and so on. Let (A, 0) E k-DGA and [a] E
HP(A,o), [b] E Hq(A,o), [c] E Hr(A,o).
Choose representative cocycles a, b,c
for these classes and assume that
[a] . [b] = 0,
and
[b]· [c] = o.
Select cochains x12 and X 23 such that
OX 12 = 0;. b,
ox23 = b· c
where, in order to simplify notation, we put 0; = (-I)P a. We can check directly
that the cochain
y = 0; . x 23 + x 12 . C
is actually a cocycle of degree p + q + r ­
1 and, therefore, determines the co-
homology class in HP+q+r-l(A, 0). The choice of the cocycle y depends on the
choice of the representatives a, band c. This indeterminancy lies in
Indeed, let
Then, one computes
8i 12 = Cil· b1 = 0;. b+ 0;. o{3 + ss .b+ ss .8{3 =

Thus, without loss of generality
i 12 = x 12 + 0; . {3 + (i . b+ (i . 8{3,

HIGHER ORDER MASSEY PRODUCTS
which means that the other representative cocycle y is of the form
y=lil· x23 + x12 . C1
=(0: + 6a)x 23 + X12 ( C+ 6,).
41
A straightforward calculation which is done simply by substituting all the above
expressions into the difference y - y shows that
y-y=(a,c)
where (a, c) denotes the sum of expressions containing a or c. Since y -
fJ is a
cocycle, the required indeterminancy is found.
Thus, we can define the triple
Massey products as follows.
Definition 6.1. A triple Massey product of the cohomology classes
[a] E HP(A, 6),
[b] E Hq(A, 6),
[c] E Hr(A, 6)
satisfying the conditions
[a] . [b] = [b] . [c] = 0
is defined by the formula
([a], [b], [cJ) = 'If([Y])
where
'If is a natural projection
'If: H*(A, 6) ---> H*(A, 6)j([a], [cD
where ([a], [cD denotes the ideal generated by [a] and [c].
Now, we want to introduce quadruple Massey products.
Note that as one
should expect, the quadruple product is defined for cohomology classes
[a]' [b], [c]' [d],
if the triple Massey products ([a], [b], [cD and ([b], [c], [d]) vanish.
However, a
stronger condition must hold. Namely, the triple Massey products given above
must vanish simultaneouslsi in the sense of the definition below. This simulta-
neous vanishing will be essential in constructing symplectic manifolds without
Kahler structure, especially in the solvmanifold case (Chapter 3).
In Chapter
3 the reader can find examples of symplectic solvmanifolds which have simulta-
neously vanishing triple Massey products and non-vanishing quadruple Massey
products.
Since ([a], [b], [cD and ([b], [c]' [dJ) are well-defined,
[a] . [b] = [b] . [c] = [c] . [d] = 0

42
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
or
bX12 = a· b,
bX23 = b· c,
bx 34 = c' d
for some cochains x 12 , x 23 and
X 34.
Consider the representatives of the triple
Massey products as cohomology classes in H*(A), say
y =a· x 23 + x 12 . c,
Z =b· x 34 + x 23 . d
Definition 6.2. We say that the triple Massey products
([aJ, [bJ, [c])
and
([bJ, [cJ, [d))
vanish simultaneously if both cohomology representatives y and z can be chosen
as coboundaries
(4)
Remark 6.3. Recall that the indeterminancy of the choice of y and z lies in
ideals ([aJ, [cD and ([bJ, [d)) respectively.
Therefore the vanishing of the triple
Massey products does not imply condition (4). An example of vanishing but not
simultaneously vanishing triple Massey products is given in [O'N].
Definition 6.4. Let [aJ, [bJ, [c] and [d] be cohomology classes in H*(A, b) of
degrees p, q, rand s respectively. Assume that
[a] . [b] = [b] . [c] = [c] . [dJ = 0
and
([aJ, [bJ, [c])
and
([bJ, [c],[d])
vanish simultaneously. Select representative cocycles a, b,c, d and cochains x 12 , x 23 ,
X 34 such that
bX12 = n . b,
bx 23 = b· C,
bx 34 = c· d.
Making use of the previous assumptions we know that there exist cochains x 13
and x 24 such that
bX13 =a . X23 + X 12 . C,
bX24 =b· x 34 + x 23 . d.
We can show by a strightforward calculation that the cochain
w =a· X 24 + X 12 . x 34 + X 13 . d
is actually a cocycle of degree p+ q+ r+ s -1. Define a quadruple Massey product
[w] = ([aJ, [bJ, [c], [d))
as a collection of all cohomology classes [w] E HP+q+r+s-l(A, b) that we can
obtain by the above procedure.
Continuing this process one can define n-tuple Massey products for all n >
4.
We have already mentioned that Massey products provide obstructions to
formality. An exact meaning of this is given by the result below.

HIGHER ORDER MASSEY PRODUCTS
43
Theorem 6.5. If a minimal graded differential algebra (M, d) = (AV, d) is for-
mal, one may make uniform choices so that the cochains representing all Massey
products and higher order Massey products are exact.
Proof. We make use of the Formality Criterion (Theorem 3.1). We know that
where the complement N satisfies the property that, for each
U E (N) with
du = 0, we have u = dv. Consider, first, a triple Massey product, say ([aJ, [bl, [c))
represented by a cocycle
y=7i'X23+X 12 · C.
Note that x 12 and x 23 are not cocycles and therefore they cannot be represented
by expressions consisting only of generators belonging to C. Moreover, without
loss of generality we can assume that they lie in (N). This means that y E (N)
and y is a coboundary by Theorem 3.1. Using the expression
we get W E (N) (by the same argument as before). The process of constructing
higher order Massey products shows that all corresponding representing cocycles
can be chosen belonging to (N) and, therefore, must be coboundaries.
0
Examples of calculations will be given in Chapters 3 and 5. Here we restrict
ourselves to an example of a simply connected minimal differential graded algebra
which admits non­vanishing Massey products.
Examples 6.6.
(1) Consider the minimal differential graded algebra
Ixl = Iyl = 2,
10:11 = 10:21 = 10:31 = 3
d(x) = d(y) = 0,
d(o:d = x2,
d(0:2) = xy,
d(0:3) = y2
One can check that
([x], [x], [y))
is a well­defined and non­vanishing triple Massey product. This example
often occurs in situations when it is necessary to construct a non­formal
differential graded algebra, therefore, it is often called a generic example
of a non-formal differential graded algebra.
(2)
For instance, by modifying this generic example, we can construct an el-
liptic simply connected and cohomologically symplectic, yet non­formal,
minimal differential algebra. Recall that a minimal DGA (AV, d) is said
to be elliptic ifits cohomology H*(AV, d) and generating vector space V
are both finite dimensional. Namely, consider

44
HOMOTOPY PROPERTIES OF KAHLER MANIFOLDS
(AV,d) = (A(x,y,z,al,a2,a3,,6,,),d)
Ixl = Iyl = Izi = 2,
lall = la21 = la31 = 1,61 = 3,
1,1 = 9
d(x) = d(y) = d(z) = 0,
d(aI) = x2,
d(a2) = xy,
d(a3) = y2
d(,B) = yz,
db) = z5 + (alY - x(2)(a3z - y,6)
This differential graded algebra is non-formal. One can guess that it is
non-formal since it is a modification of the generic example, however,
here the proof of the non-formality is better seen directly from the For-
mality Criterion (Theorem 3.1). If (AV,d) were formal, there would exist
a decomposition V = C EB N with the properties given by the Formality
Criterion. However, we see that V 2 C C and V 3 n C = {O} (where V 2
and V 3 denote, respectively, the subspaces of generators of degree 2 and
3). This means that
Since there are no elements of degree 4 which are not cocycles in this
algebra, aly-xa2 is not a coboundary. However, it is a cocycle, which is
a contradiction. It can be checked that z is a cohomologically symplectic
element (this is straightforward, but not trivial).
Remark 6.7. Example 6.6 (2) was constructed in [LOI] in order to give an answer
to the question of whether or not a simply connected elliptic compact manifold
with a cohomologically symplectic minimal model is formal. Although the DGA
above is known to be the minimal model of a smooth manifold, it is not known if
the manifold is actually symplectic. The formality of simply connected symplectic
manifolds is still one of the most interesting questions in symplectic homotopy.

CHAPTER 2
NILMANIFOLDS
The problem of constructing symplectic manifolds with no Kahlerian struc-
ture seems to be very difficult in general since its solution involves many subtle
interactions between algebraic topology, differential and algebraic geometry and
analysis. For example, the existence of a symplectic structure w on a manifold
M implies that M admits some compatible almost complex structure J. If this
almost complex structure were integrable, then M would be Kahlerian,
How-
ever, if the almost complex structure is non­integrable, then this does not imply
any definite result since it is necessary to consider a moduli space of compatible
almost complex structures for various possible symplectic structures.
Fortunately, the existence of a Kahlerian structure on M implies strong con-
sequences (e.g. formality) concerning its minimal model (see Chapter 1). Thus,
a possible way of constructing symplectic manifolds with no Kahlerian structure
is to find a symplectic manifold whzch does not satisfy these conditions (e.g.
is
non-formal).
In 1984 [McDl]' McDuff provided examples (which we shall talk more oflater)
of closed simply connected symplectic non­Kahler manifolds.
More recently,
Gompf has given a general 'surgery' technique for the construction of such ex-
amples. The main result of this chapter solves the problem completely for the
class of manifolds known as nilmanifolds.
1. Nilmanifolds
Let's begin with the definition of the central objects of study in this chapter.
Definition 1.1. A nilmanifold is a compact homogeneous space of the form
N/r, where N is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group and r is a discrete
co-compact subgroup in N (i.e. a lattice).
The general theory of nilmanifolds is contained in [Aus, VGS]. We restrict
ourselves to certain relevant properties of nilmanifolds and to presenting some
examples which reveal those properties.
Examples 1.2.
(1) An n­dimensional torus T" =
/71n is obviously a nilmanifold.
(2) (Malcev) Let n be a nilpotent Lie algebra with the property that there
exists a basis in n, el, e2, ... , en, such that the structural constants cfj
arising in brackets
[ei,ej] = I>fjek
k

46
NILMANIFOLDS
are rational numbers for all i, j, k. Then Malcev [VGS] shows that there
is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N corresponding to n which
admits a lattice (i.e. a discrete cocompact subgroup) f so that N/f is a
compact nilmanifold.
(3) The 'universal' example of a nilpotent Lie group is the group of upper
triangular matrices having 1's along the diagonal, 1IJ n (IPI. ).

Let 1IJn
C 1IJ n (lPI.) denote the set of matrices having integral entries.
Then, 1lJn (2::) is a lattice and the quotient
is a nilmanifold. The group 1IJ3(lPI.) is called the Heisenberg group and
the resulting nilmanifold is called the Heisenberg nilmanifold. This leads
to
(4)
The Generalized Heisenberq Manifolds (see [CFG]). Let H(I,p) be the
group of (p+ 2) x (p+ 2) square matrices of dimension 2p+ I of the form
A

o
where Ep denotes the p x p identity matrix, A and Care p x l-matrices
and b is a real number.
These are the generalized Heisenberg groups.
Because H(l,p) is contained in the nilpotent group
1IJp+2(lPI.), it is a
nilpotent Lie group.
Clearly the integral matrices of H(1,p) form a
discrete cocompact subgroup I' and H(l, p)/f is a nilmanifold.
From
Theorem 2.2, H(1, p)/f cannot carry any Kahler structure since it is a
non-toral nilmanifold. Also note that, if La: H(I,p)
----+ H(1,p) denotes
left translation by a E H (1, p), then
x
0 La = X + A,
yo La = y + b,
Z 0 La = Z + Ay + C
where we have chosen a (global) system of coordinates {X, y, Z} satis-
fying, for <Il E H(1,p),
X(<Il) = A,
y(<P) = b,
Z(<Il) = C.
It is easy to see that we then have
= dX,
= dy,
- Xdy) = dZ - Xdy.

Therefore, a basis for the left invariant vector fields on H(l,p) (i.e.
the Lie algebra of H(I,p)) is given by {dX,dy,dZ - Xdy}.
We will
use this information below to create a left invariant symplectic form on
H(I, p) x H(l, q).
Thus, from the second example above, it is rather easy to construct nilmani-
folds. As we shall see more clearly below, any nilmanifold is aspherical. That is,
7ri(NIl') = 0, i > 1 [Aus, VGS]. Note that, if N is non-abelian, Nlf is not diffeo-
morphic to a torus since 7r1(NIf)
f and thus is not isomorphic to 7r1 (Tn) = z:n.
One of the main results in this section is the description of minimal models of
nilmanifolds given by Theorem 1.3 below. Before we state the theorem however,
we recall the general relationship between a Lie algebra and its cochain algebra.
Let g denote a Lie algebra with basis {X I, ... ,Xs }. Then the dual of g, g*, has
basis {Xl, ... ,xs } and on the exterior algebra Ag* we obtain a differential 8 by
defining it on degree 1 elements as
and extending to Ag* as a graded (bilinear) derivation. Now, [Xi, Xj] = L cLX/,
where cL are the structure constants of g, so duality then gives
8Xk(Xi,Xj) = -c7j
so that the differential has the form (on generators)
8Xk = - L C7j Xi 1\ »s
i<j
We note that the Jacobi identity in the Lie algebra is equivalent to the condition
82 = O. In the sequel, we will call the differential graded algebra
(Ag*,8)
the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the Lie algebra g.
Theorem 1.3. [BG I, Has] Let NIf be a compact nilmanifold.
Then the
Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (An*, 8) associated to n, is isomorphic to the mini-
mal model of NIf:
(MNjr, d) '= (An*, 8).
Proof. The proof follows from the theorem of Nomizu [Nom] that the natural
inclusion
induces an isomorphism on the cohomology level.
We postpone the proof of
the Nomizu theorem until Chapter 3, where we will prove a more general result

48
NILMANIFOLDS
(Hattori's theorem) which implies the above quasi-isomorphism.
Now, we will
simply use it. Here, the superscript 'inv' denotes the left invariant forms on the
nilpotent Lie group N. From the definition of the Lie algebra associated to a Lie
group, we have
(An", 8)
(nDR(N), d).
Hence, the composition
displays (An*, 8) as a model for NIf. It remains to prove that the Chevalley-
Eilenberg complex of n is a minimal algebra. This follows from the general dual
relationship between nilpotent Lie algebras and DGA's. Consider the dual basis
Xl, ... ,Xn to the basis Xl, . . . , X n of n (ordered by central series extensions).
Then, as above, the differential 8 is defined on generators by
where [Xi,Xj] = LcfjXk. Since the Xi are ordered according to the way the
nilpotent Lie algebra n is built from central series extensions, the differential
must be decomposable in terms of earlier generators.
0
In the rest of this book, we will revert to the notation d instead of 8 for the
differential on the DGA of cochains of a Lie algebra. Before we give some ex-
amples, let's look at another (more homotopical) approach to the structure of
nilmanifolds.
Let M = NIf be the quotient of the nilpotent Lie group N by the discrete co-
compact subgroup f. It is well known that the exponential map exp: n = TeN -->
N is a global diffeomorphism, so that N is diffeomorphic to an
(Indeed, the
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorffformuia provides a nilpotent group structure for n it-
self. That is, Nand n have the very same underlying set with the structure of
both a Lie algebra and a Lie group.) Therefore, since N --> M is a covering, M
is a K(f, 1). Furthermore, I' is a finitely generated torsionfree nilpotent group;
finitely generated nilpotent because it is a discrete subgroup of the nilpotent
group Nand torsionfree since M = K(f, 1) is compact. On the algebraic side,
there is a refinement of the upper central series of I' (see [LP]),
with each f;jf;+l == tz. The length of this series is invariant and is called the
rank of f. So, for I' above, rank (f) = n. This description implies that any u E f
has a decomposition u =
...
where (un) = I'n, ... (Ui) = f;jfi+1. The
set {Ul,"
·un } is called a Malcev basis for f. Using this basis, the multiplication
in I' takes the form

where
NILMANIFOLDS
Pi(X, y) = Xi + Yi + Ti(XI, ... Xi-I, YI,··· Yi-I).
49
For instance, for the group N ::::: Un(IP!.) with f = Un(Z), a Malcev basis is given
by {Uij I 1 ::; i < j ::; n} where Uij = I + eij and
Pij(X,y)=Xij+Yij + L
XikYkj·
i<k<j
Now, consider the central extension I' n -+ I' -+ f. The cocycle for the extension
is Tn
: f
X f
-+ Z. Of course f is also finitely generated torsionfree with refined
upper central series,
Hence, rank (f) = n - 1 and
Pi(x, y) = Pi((X, 0), (y, 0)) = Xi + Yi + Ti(XI, ... xi -I , YI, ... Yi- I)
for i < n.
Clearly, then, we may iterate this process and decompose f
as n
central extensions of the form
with cocycles Ti E H 2(G; Z) (where the coefficients are untwisted since the ex-
tension is central).
The description above allows a geometric formulation. The extension class Tn
is an element of H 2(f; Z) == H 2(K(f, 1); Z) == [K(f, 1), K(Z, 2)] where the last
bijection follows from the usual identification of cohomology groups with sets of
homotopy classes of maps into Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. That is, we have
Now, K(Z,2) = Cpoo = B81 , the classifying space for principal S'J-bundles, so
Tn induces a bundle over K(f, 1),

The total space of the bundle is clearly K (f, 1) since the ensuing short exact
sequence of fundamental groups in classified by Tn. Now, because we can iterate
the algebraic decomposition of I', we obtain an iterated sequence of principal
SI-bundles classified by the Ti.

We can assume (by finite dimensionality) that each Ti has image in a finite ccpn,
hence may be approximated by a smooth map.
Then, each Mj is a compact
manifold with
dim(M j ) = dim( M j _ 1)+ 1.
Thus, dim(M) = rank (f) = n. Note that any such sequence of extensions will
produce a torsionfree nilpotent group since each M, (as a principal SI-bundle
over a manifold) is finite dimensional and all extensions are central.
Now, the decomposition of M = K(f, 1) into a tower of principal SI-bundles
is, in fact, the Postnikov decomposition of M with k-invariants the Ti.
As we
have said above (see Theorem 1.7), rational homotopy theory is designed to
model precisely this situation. Namely, rational homotopy classes correspond to
generators of the minimal model and the differential is defined by the formulas
for the k-invariants. Further, it is easy to understand the general form of these
fibrations using Theorem 4.4. Note that, because the group theoretic extensions
are central, the corresponding fibrations of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces,
K(71, 1) --+ K(G, 1) --+ K(G, 1),
are nilpotent. Indeed, the action of G on 7l is trivial so that the induced action
on H.(f{(71, 1)) is trivial as well. The first principal fibration SI
--+ M 1 --+ * says
that M l = 8 1 , so the first model is given by A(xJ) with dX1 = 0 and IXll = 1.
The next fibration 8 1 --+ M 2 --+ M 1 is modelled by
where the last DGA models the 8 1 fiber. Now, what can d be in the KS exten-
sion? Since xi = 0, there is no choice. We must have dX2 = 0 in the middle as
well. In fact, this can go on for several steps resulting in a base torus T S for the
nilmanifold. Now consider the first nontrivial fibration
with KS extension

NILMANIFOLDS
(A(XI""
, XS ) , d = 0) ----+ (A(XI""
, Xs,x.,+d, d) ----+ (A(xs+d, d = 0).
51
Again, we ask what the differential d can be. Of course, d = 0 on Xl, ... ,Xs , so
we must only understand dXs+I. Because all Xi, i = 1, ... ,5 are in degree 1, it
must be the case (from the KS extension property) that dXs+I is a polynomial
in earlier generators,
Hence, (A(XI, .. ' , Xs,xs+d, d) is minimal.
This argument does not need the
torus base, but, rather, only the KS extension property. Therefore, at each stage
of the nilmanifold's construction, the corresponding KS extension is minimal.
Hence, the final stage creates a minimal model for the nilmanifold. With this in
mind (and using a more careful analysis for the extra differential information),
Theorem 1.4. The minimal model for a nilmanifold of dimension n bes the
form of an exterior algebra
A(M) = (A(X1, ... x n ) , d)
with
IXil = 1,
with dx; = Ti, the extension cocycle representing the class Ti E H 2(Mi _ I ;2Z).
Remark 1.5. We have given two descriptions above for the minimal model of a
nilmanifold. The connection between them lies in the fact that the duals of the
lower central series quotients of a Lie algebra together with the dual to the Lie
bracket define a DGA (see the discussion before Theorem 1.3 above as well as
[GM], [Su]).
This duality is reflected by the KS extensions associated to the
tower of principal fibrations above.
Examples 1.6.
(1) ([Has]) Consider the Lie algebra n of dimension 2m + 2 having basis
with bracket structure given by
[Xi, Yi] = -Z
for all i = 1, .... m
and all other brackets zero. The associated minimal model is given by
(A(XI,". ,Xm,Y1, " . ,Ym,z,w),d)
with dx, = dYi = dw = 0 and
m
dz = LXi 1\ Yi·
ac I

52
NILMANIFOLDS
For instance, if m =
1, then n = (X, Y, Z, W) with only nonzero
bracket [X, Y] = -Z. The associated minimal model is A(x, y, z,w) with
only nonzero differential dz = xy.
Note that, in this case, the element
w = xw + yz has w 2 -# 0. This will show later that the corresponding
nilmanifold is symplectic.
(2)
Now let's look at how a minimal model may be created from a group
presentation of a finitely generated torsionfree nilpotent group.
The
torsionfree nilpotent group
I' = (x,y,z: [x,y] = z2, [x,z] = e = [y, z]),
has, by a Malcev basis argument, T = 2xy. Hence, a minimal model for
K(f, 1) is given by
A(f) = (A(x, y, z), dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = 2xy).
Now, from the description above of the Heisenberg subgroup U3(J:,) , we
see that a minimal model for the associated nilmanifold is given by
A(U3(J:,)) = (A(x, y, z), dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = xy).
cI>(z) = z.
cI>(y) = y,
Define a DGA homomorphism cI> : A(r) ---+ A(U3(J:,)) by
1
cI>(x) = "2x,
Clearly, cI> commutes with differentials and, since it is an isomorphism on
vector spaces of generators and minimal algebras are freely generated,
cI> is an isomorphism at the DGA level as well. Using the fact that the
homotopy type of an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space is determined by its
fundamental group, we have proved that I' and U3(J:,) have the same
rationalizations.
In fact, note that the very same argument holds for
any group of the form
I' = (x,y,z: [x,y] = zn, [x,z] = e= [y,z]).
Hence, all of these finitely generated torsionfree nilpotent groups ratio-
nalize to the same group.
There is one other important feature to notice about minimal models of nil-
manifolds. Namely, there are precisely n degree 1 generators for an n-dimensional
nilmanifold. Because the minimal model is an exterior algebra (so that the square
of each generator vanishes), there is only one element which can represent the top
class in cohomology. That element is the product of all generators, v = Xl ... x n .
Now let's tie in the symplectic geometry of nilmanifolds with the minimal
model.
First, it is important to realize that symplectic nilmanifolds form a
very special class of symplectic manifolds. In particular, it is not the case that

NlLMANlFOLDS
53
any manifold having a degree two cohomology class which multiplies to a top
class is symplectic.
For instance, Cp2#Cp2 has several such classes, but it
cannot be symplectic since it cannot even have an almost complex structure [Au2]
(which is automatically provided by a symplectic structure). On the other hand,
Nomizu's theorem guarantee's the existence of a cochain in (An*, 8) representing
the cohomology class in which multiplies to a top class. Since the cohomology
product cannot be zero, then the cochain (i.e.
wedge) product of the cochain
cannot be zero. But this then defines a left invariant volume form on the nilpotent
Lie group. Both the cochain (as a left invariant form) and the volume form then
descent to the nilmanifold to provide a symplectic form wedging to a volume
form. Therefore, for nilmanifolds, the proper symplectic cohomology behavior is
sufficient to guarantee the existence of a true symplectic structure.
Now, if a nilmanifold M 2k is symplectic, then there must be a degree 2 element
of the minimal model which multiplies up to the top element 1/ = Xl ... X2k. We
can write this degree 2 element as
Since w k = 1/, the sum in the expression for w must contain all the degree 1
generators. Of course not any '2-form' may be chosen. The symplectic 'form' w
must be closed.
Example 1.7. What must a 4-dimensional nilmanifold look like rationally? By
what we have said, the minimal model must have four generators and, for nonre-
dundancy reasons, two of those must be cocycles. Thus, there are three rational
homotopy types to deal with (up to isomorphism).
(1) The Torus T 4. The minimal model is (A(X1,X2,X3,X4),d = 0) and a
symplectic 'form' is w = XlX2 + X3X4.
(2) The Kodaira-Thurston manifold KT. For a geometric description
of this manifold, see §2 below. This manifold is obtained by taking the
product of the Heisenberg manifold M = U3(lW.)/U3(.::z) and the circle
51. The minimal model is given by
(A(Xl, x2, x3, X4), d)
with
dx = 0, dy = 0, dz = xy, du = 0
where the first three generators (and differential definitions) come from
M and u comes from the circle.
A symplectic 'form' is then given by
w = xu + yz. Note that the degree 1 cohomology of KT is generated by
the classes of x, y and u. Hence, the first Betti number is three and, by
the Hard Lefschetz property (see Example 1.3.6), KT cannot be Kahler.
This was the how it was first demonstrated that compact symplectic
non-Kahler manifolds exist.
(3) Take the minimal model (A(XI,X2,X3,X4),d) with dx = 0, dy = 0,
dz = xy and du = xz.
Recall that the corresponding finitely gener-
ated torsionfree nilpotent group may be realized as a nilmanifold. Then
a symplectic 'form' is given by w = xu + yz. See Example 1.6 above.

54
NILMANIFOLDS
So, all 4-dimensional nilmanifolds admit symplectic structures. By contrast,
the reader may calculate the following
Example 1.8. The 6-dimensional nilmanifold U4(IP!.)/U4(!Z) is not symplectic
because no closed 'form' w in its minimal model can be found whose cube does
not vanish.
2. The Benson-Gordon-Hasegawa Theorem
Nilmanifolds form one of the best test classes in geometry and topology. On
the one hand, their nonabelian natures introduce a complexity not found in tori,
while on the other hand, their homotopy theory is still amenable to study.
In
particular, they have minimal models. So, it is no surprise that nilmanifolds are
often the first non-toral cases to be considered in geometric or topological prob-
lems (e.g.
the construction of isospectral non-isometric manifolds).
Of course,
even dimensional tori carry Kahler structures, so the natural question to ask
is whether something similar can be said about nilmanifolds. We have already
seen in Example 1.8 that not every even dimensional nilmanifold is symplectic,
so first, we must restrict ourselves to that subclass. Then we have the manifold
mentioned in Example 1.7.
Example 2.1: The Kodaira-Thurston Manifold KT.
[Th]
The manifold KT is the quotient IP!.4/r, where r is the discrete affine group
generated by unit translations along the XI, X2 and X3 axes together with the
transformation (XI, X2, X3, X4) f---+ (XI +X2, X2, X3, X4+ 1). KT is a T 2-bundle over
T 2 and its symplectic form lifts to the standard form dXI 1\ dX2 + dX3 1\ dX4 on
IP!.4 The Kodaira-Thurston manifold is a symplectic nilmanifold with first Betti
number equal to 3. Because Kahler manifolds have even odd Betti numbers (see
Example 1.3.6), KT cannot be Kiihler. The minimal model for KT is given in
Example 1.7 (2).
We shall give another description of KT below as a special
case of a more general collection of symplectic non-Kahler nilmanifolds.
The Kodaira-Thurston example is, in fact, characteristic of nilmanifold behav-
ior. That is, no nilmanifolds can be Kahler except for ton. This result, Theorem
2.2 below, is the main theorem of this section, solving the Weinstezn- Thurston
problem in the class of nilmanifolds.
Theorem 2.2. [BG 1, Has] Let M = N/f be a compact nilmanifold.
If M
admits a Kiihlerian structure, it is diffeomorphic to a torus.
Proof. We have seen in Theorem 1.4 (and the development leading to it) that
the minimal model of M is an exterior algebra MM = A(x I, ... ,xn ) with top
class represented by the cocycle lJ = XI"
·Xn . Now, except when dx, = 0 for all
i = 1, ... ,n, no matter how we write the generators of the model, lJ is always an
element of the ideal Ideal(N) generated by the complement to the closed degree
1 generators. Since lJ is a closed non-exact cocycle in Ideal(N), Theorem 1.3.1

NILMANIFOLDS
55
says that MM is not formal. By Theorem 1.3.7, M cannot be Kahler. In case
all dXi = 0, then M has the rational homotopy type of a torus.
Now, since the fundamental group Jrl M of a nilmanifold is torsionfree and
({Jl-Iocalization has torsion kernel, Jrl M must inject into EB({Jl. Hence, since Jrl M
is finitely generated and injects into an abelian torsionfree group, it must be the
case that JrIM
EB!.Z and M has the homotopy type of a torus. But M is a true
nilmanifold, so its fundamental group classifies its diffeomorphism type ([Mos]).
Therefore, M is diffeomorphic to a torus.
0
Remark 2.8. Theorem 2.2 was also proved by Hano in [Hano] and was evidently
known to Koszul. Hano's proof is quite geometric and relies on a description of
the covariant derivative under the Kahler condition.
In fact, however, the hypothesis of Theorem 2.2 is too strong.
Recall from
Definition 1.3.12 that a (cohomologically) symplectic manifold M has Lefscheiz
type if
is an isomorphism.
Theorem 2.4. ([BG1, McD2, L01, L02] A symplectic nilmanifold M of Lef-
schetz type is diffeomorphic to a torus.
Proof [L01]. We have seen that the minimal model for M is (A(XI, ... ,X2n), d)
with symplectic 'form' given by
W = L
aijXiXj + ZX2n
i,j<2n
where we have taken out all terms involving the last generator X2n' Assume that
d =f O. First note that, because of the stage-by-stage construction of the minimal
model, the last generator X2n cannot appear in any differential dXi, i = 1, ... ,2n.
Hence, since dw = 0, the only way to have the term dz . X2n cancelled is for z to
be a cocycle, dz = O. Now define a derivation A of degree -1 by
{
A(Xi) = 0
A(X2n) = 1
for i < 2n
Extend A freely to (A(XI,... ,X2n), d). The effect of A on w follows from the
definition and the derivation property;
A(W) = z.
The derivation A obeys the relation Ad = ­dA because d is decomposable, so a
derivation of cohomology is induced with A([W]) = [z] =f 0 since z is a non-zero
degree 1 cocycle.
Now, a basis for HI(M) consists precisely of the generators Xl, ... ,X s with
d.x, = 0, i = 1, ... ,s. By the definition of A then, A(HI(M)) = O. Let [a] be

56
THE BENSON-GORDON-HASEGAWA THEOREM
any element of HI (M) and consider [a] U [w n ] . Since this class is above the top
degree, [a] U [w n ] = O. Applying .\, we obtain
0= .\([0'] U [w n ]) = .\([0']) U [w n ] - [a] U .\([wn ]) = -Iol U .\([wn ]) .
Now [a] U .\([wn ]) = 0 for any [a] E H1(M), where .\([wn ]) E H 2n - 1(M). By
Poincare duality (i.e. the non degeneracy of the bilinear form), this can only be
true if .\([wn ]) = O. But then
0= .\([wn ]) = n .\([w]) U [w n - 1]
and the hypothesis of Lefschetz type implies that this can happen only when
.\([w]) = O. This contradicts the equation .\([w]) = [z] =f- 0 derived above. The
contradiction lies in the assumption that d =f- 0, so we see that a Lefschetz type
nilmanifold must have d = 0 and, so, have the rational homotopy type of a torus.
Now, the same argument as in the final paragraph of the proof of Theorem
2.2 shows that M is diffeomorphic to a torus.
0
Remark 2.5. McDuff's proof of Theorem 2.4 ([McD2]) is closely related to the
proof given in [L02].
Both use the fact due to Ono [Ono] (and generalized in
[L02]) that, in the presence of the Lefschetz type condition, a symplectic circle
action 51 x M -+ M on a closed symplectic manifold M has fixed points if and
only if the orbit map (restricting the action to a fixed rna E M) t : 51 -+ M is
trivial on homology. Then, the idea is as follows. Without loss of generality, we
can assume the symplectic form on M = NIf comes from a left invariant form
on the nilpotent Lie group N. Now, the center of I' is contained in the center of
N, so each element of the center of I' gives rise to a free symplectic circle action
on M. If I' is nilpotent but not abelian, then there exists [War] an element a
in the intersection of the center of I' and the commutator subgroup [I", I']. But
then we have a free (so without fixed points) circle action with [*(VSl) = 0'=0
since H1(M) = TI[f, I'].
This contradicts the Ono equivalence.
Hence, the
non-abelian hypothesis is incorrect and M is again a torus.
Theorem 2.2 covers some particular results of [CFG, DFGM, Th]. We present
two of these results below to give the reader a picture of the geometry involved
in these questions.
Example 2.6: The CFG-Manifolds M(p, q). [CFG]

dimension 2p + 1 of the form

where E p denotes the p x p identity matrix, A and Care p x l-rnatrices and b
is a real number.
These are the generalized Heisenberg groups.
Let G(p, q) =
H (1, p) x H( 1, q) and let I'(p, q) be the subgroup of matrices with integer entries.
Define

NILMANIFOLDS
M(p, q) = G(p, q)jf(p, q).
57
If p or q is larger than 0, then M(p, q) is a symplectic compact manifold with no
Kahlerian structure.
Let's see why this is so. Because G(p, q) is contained in the nilpotent group
x
it is a nilpotent Lie group.
Clearly the integral matrices
of G(p, q) form a discrete cocompact subgroup. Hence, M(p, q) is a nilmanifold.
From Theorem 2.2, M(p, q) cannot carry any Kahler structure since it is a non-
toral nilmanifold.
It remains to prove that M(p, q) carries a symplectic form.
This form is
constructed as follows: take the natural projection
1(
: G(p, q) ........, M(p, q)
and define a left invariant 2­form W on G(p, q) of maximal rank by the formula:
W = 's», /\ (dZI ­ Xldyd +ux,». (dZ2 ­ X 2dY2)+ dYI /\ dY2
(where a global coordinate system for G(p, q) consists of {X I , YI , Z I , X 2, Y2, Z2}
in 'natural' matrix notations). Since w is left invariant, it follows directly that
w descends to won M(p, q) such that 1('W = wand the maximality of rank is
preserved.

Theorem 2.8. The Kodaira-Thurston manifold KT is a compact symplectic
manifold with no Kiihlerian structure.
Outline of Proof. Let WT be the standard volume form on T 2 . Since p preserves
WT, this defines a closed 2­form W on KT which is non-degenerate on each fiber.
Let p: KT ........, T 2 be the projection onto the base. It can be verified that
W + p'WT

As Thurston points out, it is in fact true that, for K
sufficiently large, Wi + K P*WT is symplectic for any closed Wi which is a volume
form for each fiber. To prove that M 4 is non-Kahler, observe that M 4 = M(l, 0)
as in Example 2.6.

Remark 2.9.
(I) The original proof of Thurston was based on the direct calculation of
the first Betti number b,(KT) = 3 contradicting the Hard Lefschetz
condition entailed by a Kahler structure.

covered by Theorem 2.2.
3. Symplectic Structures on Nilmanifolds
and Related Miscellany
For completeness, we end this chapter with the general description of sym-
plectic structures on nilmanifolds [BG 1] as well as some other relevant facts and
constructions. Suppose that G is a Lie group with Lie algebra g. It is well known
that any orbit 0 in g* under the coadjoint action of G on g* carries a canonical
symplectic structure WQ [Aul, AuL]. Recall that g* denotes the dual of 9 and
that the coadjoint action is given by the linear map Ad*g: g* ---+ g* defined by
(Ad*g(O'), X) = (0', Ad(g-1 )(X))
where X E g, 0' E g*, Ad is the usual adjoint representation of G on 9 (described
by differentiating conjugation in G) and (
) is the natural pairing between 9
and g*. Upon differentiating this equation, we obtain the infinitesimal expression
(ad*Y la, X) = (0', [Y, Xl)
where Y, X E 9 and 0' E g*.
Now, the orbit Oa of G (by the coadjoint action) through a given 0' E g* IS
given by GIGa , where Ga is the isotropy subgroup
o; = {g E G IAd*g(O') = O'}.
Since Ga is a Lie subgroup, it is detectable infinitesimally by the Lie algebra
"isotropy" subalgebra
ga = {X E 9 Iad"x], = O}
={X E 9 IO'([X,-]) = OJ.
By definition, an orbit 0 is called normal if the isotropy subgroup of any point
in 0 is normal.

NILMANIFOLDS

Theorem 3.1. [BG 1] Let GIf be a symplectic nilmanifold. There is a normal
coadjoint orbit 0 (for some larger nilpotent group) and a Lie group isomorphism
1;: 0
----> G such that :/J*(w) is cohomologous to wo, where :/J denotes the induced
diffeomorphism
Proof [BGl]. Let g::o: g+span(W) denote a Lie algebra constructed from g and
a new generator W. The brackets in g are defined by
[X, WliJ::o: 0
[X, YliJ::o: [X, Y]n + w(X, Y)W
for all X E g
for all X, Y E g.
Now let's check the Jacobi identity. Below, we freely use the facts that the
Jacobi identity holds in 9 and all brackets with W vanish in g. Then, we have
[X, [Y, ZliJliJ + [Y, [Z, XliJliJ + [Z, [X, YliJliJ
::0: [X, [Y, Z] + w(Y, Z)WliJ + [Y, [Z, X] + w(Z, X)WliJ + [Z, [X, Y] + w(X, Y)WliJ
= [X, [Y, Z] + [Y, [Z, X] + [Z, [X, Y] + w(X, [Y, Z])W
+ w(Y, [Z, X])W + w(Z, [X, Y])W
= 0 + (-w([Y, Z]' X) + w([X, Z]' Y) - w([X, Y], Z))W
::0: (-Xw(Y, Z) + Yw(X, Z) - Zw(X, Y))W
since the exterior derivative of w is zero and we have the formula for d,
dw(X, Y, Z) = Xw(Y, Z) - Yw(X, Z) + Zw(X, Y)
- w([X, Y], Z) + w([X, Z]' Y) - w([Y, Z]' X).
But now we observe that we have the very special situation of a left invariant w
form evaluated on left invariant vector fields X, Y and Z.
With this in mind,
let's consider the first term Xw(Y, Z).
Let 1;(t) denote an integral curve of X
with 1;(0) = p. Then we have (by left invariance of the vector fields)
d
Xw(Y, Z)(p) = dt (w(Y, Z)(1;(t)))
d
= dt (w¢(t)(Y¢(t), Z¢(t)))
d
= dt (w¢(t)(Lq,(t)* Yp, Lq,(t)*Zp))
::0:
(L4,(t)w¢(t)(Yp, Zp))
d
= dt (wp(Yp, Zp))
=0

60
SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON NILMANIFOLDS
by the left invariance of w (and because wp(Yp,Zp) is a constant).
Therefore,
applying this to the Jacobi identity calculation above, we see that
[X, [Y, Zhh + [Y, [Z,Xhh + [Z, [X, Yhh = o.
Clearly, the center of 9is given by 3 = span(W), so there is a central extension
of Lie algebras
3 -
9 -
g.
This central extension then shows that 9 is a nilpotent Lie algebra since 9 is.
Now let (; denote the simply connected Lie algebra associated to 9and let 0: E g*
denote the element dual to W. That is, o:(W) = I and o:(g) = O. The isotropy
subalgebra g", is then given by
g", = {X E 9 Io:([X,-J) = O}
= span(W)
= 3·
Thus, since the isotropy subalgebra is central, the isotropy subgroup (;'" is normal
and 0", is a normal orbit with Lie algebra gl3. The Lie algebra isomorphism
g/3 -
9 then extends to a Lie group isomorphism ¢: 0", -
G and, for X, Y E g,
do:(X, Y) = -o:([X, Yh)
= -o:([X, Y] + w(X, Y)W)
=-w(X, Y)
so that ¢*w =
is the proper symplectic form. These forms then descend to
the nilmanifold quotients and we are done.
0
Now let's consider yet another way to view symplectic nilmanifolds.
Let
(M 2n , w) denote a symplectic manifold (not necessarily a nilmanifold for the
moment) with integral form w (i.e. [w] E H 2(M; Z)). Since principal 5 1-bundles
over M are classified by H 2(M; Z), we may form the principal 8 1-bundle
-
w--
K(Z,2).
Further, the class [w] is transgressive (see [BTuJ), so there exists a (connection)
form r, on Ai with dij = w with [w] = [w].
Therefore there is a l-forrn v on
M with w = w+ d,.
Moreover, 1r*, is horizontal, equivariant and, since 8 1 is
abelian, we have

where Rt denotes right translation by t E 51. If we then let n =

we
obtain
and
d"., = 7I"*w.
Let
denote a vertical vector field with

since
= ,(71"*0 = 0 because

,V2n are linearly
independent horizontal vectors at a point, then ("., 1\ d".,n
VI,... , Vn) :F O.
Recall that an odd dimensional manifold U 2k+l is a contact manifold if U has
a l-forrn 0: (i.e. the contact form) such that 0: I\do:k is a volume form on U. That
is, 0: 1\ do: k is nonzero at every point. Contact manifolds arise as constant energy
surfaces (i.e. regular level surfaces of Hamiltonian functions) on phase space. In
some sense, contact manifolds are an odd dimensional counterpart to symplectic
manifolds. The discussion above then shows that, to any symplectic manifold
with integral symplectic form, there is a principal circle bundle over the manifold
with total space a contact manifold. Moreover, the symplectic manifold is then
the orbit space of a free 5 1-action on the contact manifold. This construction is
known as the Boothby-Wang fibration [BW] and the discussion above has been
culled from [BI]. The Boothby-Wang theorem ([BW]; also see [BI]) then says that
the converse also holds. That is, oversimplifying a bit, a free circle action on a
contact manifold which preserves the contact form has orbit space a symplectic
manifold.
Now, how does the Boothby-Wang fibration fit into our discussion of nilman-
ifolds? First, note that, if (M, w) is a symplectic manifold with non-rational w
(i.e.
w rt Im(Hi(M; Q) ---+ Hi(M; !Pl.)), then there is another symplectic form w
arbitrarily close to w which is rational.
An integral multiple of w is thus in-
tegral, so without loss of generality, we assume this is the case for w.
So now
let (M, w) be a symplectic nilmanifold with integral symplectic form.
Because
w E H 2 (M; 2:), we may induce a principal circle bundle
w---.
K(2:,2)
using the symplectic class w. Of course, this is the Boothby-Wang fibration, so
N is a contact manifold with contact form 0: having do: = 7I"*w. Moreover, our
earlier discussion of the construction of nilmanifolds by principal circle bundles
shows that N is also a nilmanifold.
Therefore, just as in the Benson-Gordon
result, this construction stays within the nilpotent world. Also, from our earlier
discussion of a nilmanifold's minimal model, we see that, if M has minimal model
(An", 8) = (A(Xl"
" ,X2n,d) with symplectic representative w, then the minimal
model for N is given by
MN = (An*, 8) = (A(Xl"
.. ,X2n,z ,d)
with z representing the contact form and dz = -w. (Here we choose the negative
sign to make the connection with the Benson-Gordon result apparent below.)

62
SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON NILMANIFOLDS
What is the nilpotent Lie algebra which correspond to N? From §1 recall that,
for M to be symplectic, it must be the case that the minimal model representative
of the symplectic form has the description
where the sum is over all i,j = 1, ... ,2n (with i < j say). Therefore, we have
and duality gives a Lie algebra corresponding to the nilmanifold N with basis
{X 1, ... ,X2n , Z} and bracket structure (where we use nilmanifold subscripts to
denote the corresponding Lie algebras)
[Xi,Z]N = 0,
The first equality comes from the duality between the bracket and the differential
of the minimal model and the fact that the generator z, being the last generator
in a minimal DGA, does not appear in the differential of any other generator.
The second equality comes from the duality between bracket and differential and
the fact that both dz and other dXk (which come from M!)
may contain XiXj
terms. Finally, note that, thinking of w as an invariant form,
so that the bracket definition above is precisely that of the Benson-Gordon Lie
algebra (up to sign). Therefore, the nilpotent Lie group which gives rise to N is
the same one whose coadjoint orbit is M. Thus,
Theorem 3.2. Every symplectic nilmanifold (M,w) arises as the orbit space of
a free circle action on a contact nilmanifold (N, a) such that a is invariant under
the action and 1T*(W) = do., where 7T: N -+ M is the orbit space projection.
In fact, in the nilmanifold situation we can say more. Suppose we start with
a contact nilmanifold (N, a) with left invariant contact form a having minimal
model
The contact form a is a l-form, so it is some linear combination of the Xi
(where these elements are thought of as invariant forms).
Also,
a /\ dan # 0,
so we must have b2n +l # 0. Otherwise, since X2n+l appears in no differentials,
a /\ dan could not contain all generators and, so could not reach the top class of
the exterior algebra, X1X2"
·X2n+l. Therefore, we may replace X2n+l by a and
write the minimal model as

NILMANIFOLDS
63
Of course, do must be a polynomial including all the other generators in order to
obtain a 1\ dan ¥- O. As we have seen, a is obtained by a principal circle bundle
over another nilmanifold having minimal model
AM = (A(X1, ... ,X2n), d).
Moreover, since dan ¥- 0 above, then this element, considered in AM is also
nontrivial (since only the generators Xl, ... ,X2n make it up). But this is precisely
enough to guarantee that the nilmanifold M corresponding to AM is symplectic.
Therefore,
Theorem 3.3. Every contact nilmanifold with invariant contact form has a free
circle action whose orbit space is a symplectic manifold.
Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 set up a kind of correspondence between contact nilrnani-
folds (with invariant contact form) and symplectic nilmanifolds. The interest in
this particular correspondence comes from the fact that, just as in Theorem 3.1,
general constructions (i.e. Bothby­Wang) in this case stay within the nilpotent
world.
We have seen that non­total nilmanifolds can never be Kahler, but it is not
unreasonable to think that they may still have the structure of complex mani-
folds. In fact, as we shall see, nilmanifolds are particularly easy to study in this
regard.
Recall that an almost complex structure on a manifold M is an automorphism
of the tangent bundle J: T M -> T M such that J2 =­ iTM. Because J behaves
as the complex number i, it may be used to give the tangent vector spaces com-
plex structures at each point of M. Of the spheres, only 52 = CP1 and 56 have
almost complex structures.
Complex manifolds certainly have almost complex
structures, but the existence of an almost complex structure does not necessarily
mean that the underlying manifold is a complex manifold however. Also, almost
complex structures provide an equivalent definition of Kahler manifold for the
more geometricly minded reader. Namely, a complex manifold is Kahler if the
associated almost complex structure is preserved by parallel translation.
Proposition 3.4. A symplectic manifold has an almost complex structure.
Sketch of Proof. Given a Riemannian metric (­, ­), the nondegeneracy of w
allows us to define an isomorphism A (on each tangent space) by w(X, Y) =
(X, AY).
Then it is easy to see that A is a normal and skew operator, so its
polar decomposition A = 5 J has 5 J = J S with 5 positive definite symmetric
and J an isometry. Furthermore, these properties and the skewness of A give
Jt = At (5- 1)t = -AS- 1 = ­5 J 5­ 1 = -J.

64
SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON NILMANIFOLDS
But J is an isometry, so ]I = J- 1 .
Hence, -J = J- 1 and, therefore, J2
:=
J( _J- 1 ) := -1. Thus J is an almost complex structure. Also, the definition of
A and the symmetricness of S give
w(JX, JY) = (J X, AJY)
:= (JX, SJ2y )
=(lX, -SY)
= (SJX,-Y)
=(AX, -Y)
=-(Y, AX)
= -w(Y, X)
=w(X, Y).
Thus, J is an 'isometry' with respect to w as well.
Remark 3.5. We can define a new scalar product by
(X, Y) := (SX, Y)
o
where S is the symmetric positive definite matrix of the polar decomposition
A = SJ. The reader may easily show that, in fact, (X, Y) = w(J X, Y) so that
the complex structure J is calibrated by w (see [AuI, AuL] for example). The
space of calibrated almost complex structures is important because it is known
to be connected and contractible.
In order to understand the restrictiveness of the requirement of an almost
complex structure on a manifold, we now give a beautiful result of Michele Audin.
Theorem 3.6. [Au2] If M 1 and M 2 are 4-manifolds with almost complex struc-
tures, then W
:= M 1#M2 has no almost complex structure.
To prove this result, we will modify Audin's original proof by using a lemma
brought to our attention by Bob Gompf.
Lemma 3.7. If M is a 4-manifold with almost complex structure, then
is even, where b1 is the first Betti number, b+ is the number of positive diagonal
entries for the signature form, X is the Euler characteristic and (1 is the signature.
Proof. The Euler characteristic is defined to be X := I - b1 +h - b3 + I while the
signature is (1 = b; - L
with b2 = b+ +L. Hence we have X+ (1 = 2 - 2b1+ 2&+.
Borel and Hirzebruch showed that, if x is any cohomology class with P2(x) = W2
(P2 is reduction mod 2 and W2 is the Stiefel-Whitney class), then x 2 = (1 mod 8.
An almost complex structure provides Chern classes and P2 (ci) = W2, so ci :=
(1 mod 8. The Pontryagin class PI (T M) is given by

NILMANIFOLDS
Pl(TM) = (-I)Cl(TM Q\I q
= cl(TM EB TM)
= ci - 2C2
since we have total Chern class
c(TM EB T M) = c(TM)c(TM)
= (1 + Cl + c2)(1 -
Cl + C2)
= 1+ 2C2 - ci.
65
The Hirzebruch signature formula gives (ci - 2C2, [M)) = 30" with
C2
x, so
ci = 2X+ 30" = 2(X + 0") + 0" and we have
2(X + 0") = ci - 0" = 8£.

Proof of Theorem 3.6. Except in degrees 0 and 4, the Betti numbers of the
connected sum are the sums of the Betti numbers of the components. Hence,
1- bl(W) + b+(W) = 1 - b1(Md - bl(M2 ) + b+(Md + b+(M2 )
= 1 - bl(M1 ) + b+(Ml) - bl(M2 ) + b+(M2 ) .
But 1- bl(Md + b+(Md is even by Lemma 3.5 and so is 1 - bdM2 ) + b+(M2 )
which means -b1(M2 ) + b+(M2 ) is odd. Therefore, 1 - bl(W) + b+(W) is odd,
so W does not have an almost complex structure.

Example 3.8. One of our basic examples of symplectic (in fact, Kahler) mani-
folds is CP2. By Theorem 3.6, Cp2#Cp2 is not symplectic however, because it
does not have an almost complex structure.
Now let's consider the case of an almost complex structure J on a nilmanifold.
We may define J on a nilmanifold by first defining it on the Lie algebra of the
associated nilpotent Lie group.
Example 3.9: Generalized Hopf Manifolds [CFL). Take the Lie algebra of
Example 1.6 (1) n of dimension 2m + 2 having basis
{Xl, ... ,Xm , Y1, · · · ,Ym , Z, W}
with bracket structure given by
[Xi, Yi) = -Z
for all i = 1, .. , ,m
and all other brackets zero. Let

66
SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES ON NILMANIFOLDS
leX;) = Y;,
ley;) = -Xi,
l(Z) = W,
leW) = -Z.
This defines a left invariant almost complex structure on the nilpotent Lie group
associated to n which then descends to the nilmanifold level. The Nijenhuis tensor
of the almost complex structure is then
and this is easily computed to be zero for X, Y, Z, W. Hence, by the Newlander-
Nirenberg Theorem [KN], the almost complex structure J is integrable and the
nilmanifold has the structure of a complex manifold. Of course, as we have seen,
by virtue of its being a nilmanifold, this manifold can never be Kahler. Note that
in case m = 1 we get the
J(odaira- Thurston manifold which is symplectic.
In
higher dimensions this construction never yields a symplectic manifold. Indeed,
taking the minimal model of it in the form given by Example 1.6:
(M, d) = (A(Xl, '" Xm, Yl, ...,Ym, ZJ w), d)
with dx; = dYi = dw = 0 and
m
dz = 2.:= Xi 1\ Yi,
i=1
we can calculate H 2(M). We get
H 2(M ,d) = ([w 1\ Xi], [w1\ Yi], [Xi 1\ Y]], [Xi 1\ Xj], [Yi 1\ Yj]Ii= 1, "'J m, j = 1, "'J m)
which implies
w m +1 = 0,
if m
2 for any w E H 2(M).
Since the dimension of the given manifold (i.e. = dim n) is 2m + 2 J the latter
equality shows that M is not cohomologically symplectic and, hence, the corre-
sponding manifold cannot carry symplectic structures either. This example was
discussed in [CFL] in the following context.
Let (M, J) be an almost complex
manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric (, ) and a fundamental (1, 1)­form
given by w = (1 X
J Y) for X, Y E X(M). Recall that the Lee form () is defined by
1
()(X)=-(

n ­ 1
where 6 here denotes the coderivative.
A manifold (M, (, ),1) is said to be a
locally conformal J(dhler manifold if 1 is integrable and
dw = w 1\ 8.
If, in addition, the Lee form () is parallel with respect to the Levi­Civitta connec-
tion \7, the manifold is called a generalized Hopf manifold. It is shown in [CFL]

To end this section (as well as the chapter), we must note one geometric
property of nilmanifolds which will prove essential to our discussion of McDuff's
blow­up examples later on.
Theorem 3.11. Let G be a Lie group and suppose tbet. I' is a lattice contained
in G. Then GIf is parallelizable.
Recall that a lattice I' is a discrete subgroup of G such that the space of cosets
GIf is compact. Also recall that a manifold M k is parallelizable if its tangent
bundle is trivial TM
M x ]Rk.
Proof. It is easy to see that a Lie group is parallelizable. Take a basis for the
Lie algebra 9 = TeG, {Xl, .. . ,Xd, and use left translation in G to extend the
Xi to left invariant vector fields on G. Because the translated Xi form a basis
for each of the tangent spaces TgG, the tangent bundle is a product G x ]Rk.
Now note that the lattice I' acts on G by left multiplication so that the Xi are
f­invariant as well. Therefore the Xi descend to vector fields Y; on the quotient
manifold GIf. Furthermore, because I' is discrete, the projection 7r: G --+ GIf
is a smooth covering map ­
hence a local diffeomorphism.
In particular, we
have for every 9 E G,
""
7r*: TgG --=-. T1r(g)G/f.
Now, if at some point 7r(g) E G/f, there exist ai, i = 1, ... ,k not all zero with
then, because 7r* is an isomorphism,
alXl (g) + ... + akXdg) = O.
This contradicts the fact that the Xi are linearly independent. Hence, no such
a, exist and the Y; are linearly independent at every point as well. Therefore,
GIf is parallelizable.

CHAPTER 3
SOLVMANIFOLDS
In this chapter we analyze the existence problem for Kahler and symplectic
structures in the class of solvmanlfolds. The first results in this direction were
obtained in [BG2 J FG2, FLS, Tr2, Tr3].
More generally, in [BG2] the authors
raised the problem of describing asphericol K dhler and symplectlc manifolds.
The problem described in this section
[S much more subtle than the problem
descr ibed in Chapter 2 for several reasons. The main one is determined by the
fact that there are symplectic solvnuuiijolds which have the rational homotopy
type of K iihler manifolds but which are certainly non-Kdhler.
These manifolds
are distinguished from Kahler manifolds by more refined techniques such as, for
example, Kodaira's classification of complex surfaces [BPV J FM]. However, the
main stimulating conjecture in this regard extends the Benson-Gordon-Hasegawa
theorem (Theorem 2.2.2) to solvmanifolds (see [BG2]).
Conjecture (Benson-Gordon). The only compact solvmanifolds which carry
Kahler structures are tori.
One of the main goals of this chapter is to present, in a unified manner, various
approaches to this conjecture. In particular, we systematically use the Mostow
bundle
Nf/f --4 G/f --4 GINf
associated with a solvmanifold G/f. However, if one wants to use this bundle
in the rational homotopy context, one meets the difficulty that, in general, the
action of the fundamental group of the base
11"1 (GIf) on the cohomology of the
fiber H*(G/f) is not nilpotent and, therefore, Theorem 1.4.4 is not available.
Therefore, we must use the more complicated Theorem 1.4.6 combined with a
deeper analysis of the 11"1 (GIf)-action.
This analysis (Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 below) should be considered as poten-
tially one of the most important results of this chapter. Theorem 3.8 allows us to
prove the Benson-Gordon conjecture in dimension four. This result explains all
of the known four-dimensional examples of Fernandez-Gray and others. Next J we
consider examples of symplectic non-Kahler solvmanifolds in higher dimensions.
These examples are based on the Hattori theorem. Since this theorem (and its
proof) is very important and potentially may be extended to more general situa-
tions, we give a complete proof (more in the spirit ofrational homotopy than the
original) and construct examples. Finally, we propose a general approach to the
problem along the lines of Sullivan's original twisted models, models which are not
K.S. extensions, but rather Stasheff's aloebraic fibrations. We make a complete
algebraic analysis of these models in the context of the Mostow bundle. Unfor-
tunately, we don't know whether non-nilpotent Mostow bundles admit twisted
tensor products as models. However J using algebraic results of this chapter we are

able to derive the Benson-Gordon theorem which describes Chevalley-Eilenberg
complexes of completely solvable solvmanifolds.
1. Solvmanifolds and their Mostow Bundles
To begin, let us recall some notions and results in the theory of solvmanifolds.
The basic references for this information are [Aus, AGH, VGS]. We restrict our-
selves to quotients of simply connected solvable Lie groups over lattices.
Definition 1.1. A quotient GIf of a solvable simply connected Lie group G
and a discrete co-compact subgroup I' (i.e. a lattice) is called solvmanifold.
It is important to note that there is a more general notion of solvmanifold (see
[Aus, AGH, VGS]) , but we are only considering solvmanifolds as in Definition
1.1. In particular, note that the Klein bottle is not a solvmanifold covered by
this definition.
Of course, every nilmanifold is also a solvmanifold. However, there are many
solvmanifolds which are not diffeomorphic to any nilmanifold since 7rl (GIf) is,
in general, not nilpotent. Moreover, it is known that if the fundamental group of
a solvmanifold is nilpotent, then this manifold is diffeomorphic to a nilmanifold
[VGS]. All solvmanifolds are aspherical.
While examples of solvmanifolds are discussed in this section, there is, how-
ever, no simple criterion for the existence of a lattice I' in a solvable Lie group
G. Therefore, it is not as easy to produce solvmanifolds as it is to produce nil-
manifolds. Nevertheless, solvmanifolds have been studied for many years and it
is known that they possess a rich structure. The most important points of that
structure come from the M ostow structure theorem.
Theorem 1.2 (Mostow Structure Theorem). Let GIf be a compact solv-
manifold. Consider the maximal connected nilpotent subgroup N of G. Then
(i) Nf is a closed subgroup in G;
(ii) N n I' is a lattice in N;
(iii) GIvr is a torus.
Consequently, each solvmanifold GIf can be naturaJIy fibered over a torus with
a nilmanifold as a fiber,
NIN n I' = Nf/f --> G/f --> GINf .
(1)
Definition 1.3. The bundle (1) will be called the Mostow bundle.
Remark 1.4. In the context of this work, the method of proof of this theorem is
not related to the techniques which we want to develop. However, we sketch the
proof very briefly now for completeness. Note, first, that the only non- trivial part
of the proof is (i). Indeed, having the closedness of Nf we get the compactness
of GINf and Nf/f == NIN n f. Hence, NIN n r is a compact nilmanifold as
required. Moreover, since GIN == lR. k , the obvious covering GIN --> GINnf has
fiber rIf n N and the only possibility for the base is GIN n r == T k

SOLVMANIFOLDS
Thus, it remains to prove that Nf is closed in G. Take the closure Nf and
denote by H an identity component of Nf. Thus, H is a connected Lie subgroup
in G. In fact, we shall prove below that
H =N.
This equality shows that Nf as a Lie group has the topology induced from G,
and, hence, is a Lie subgroup in G. From the well-known Cartan theorem, Nf
is closed.
So, it remains to prove that H = N.
We refer to Mostow's work [Mos],
for details. First, observe that for each Lie algebra there exists a minimal ideal
gOO C g such that g/gOO is nilpotent. Secondly, for each Lie group and Lie algebra
the notion of a regular element is defined.
Definition 1.5. Let 'P be any endomorphism of a vector space V.
Denote by
a-('P) the number of eigenvalues of'P different from 0 and by 11"('P) the number of its
eigenvalues different from 1. Recall that, by definition, rankg = SUPXE9 a-(adX)
and rank G = sUPxEG 1I"(Ad x). We say that X (respectively, x) is regular if
at ad X) = rank g,
1I"(Ad x) = rank G.
The required equality is proved by combining the following observations. On
one hand, it is proved in [Mos] that for each regular element exp X E G, the
endomorphism Ad(exp X) I(g"" /[g"" ,g""]) has no eigenvalues equal to 1.
On the
other hand, if we assume that H # N, an easy exercise in Lie algebra theory
yields two chains of ideals in g with proper inclusions:
gOO C n C
C g,
C
C g.
Since the inclusions above are proper, H OO # {l} and, hence I' nH'" is a discrete
co-compact subgroup in H
OO
• Mostow shows (in the most difficult and technical
part of the proof) that there exists a regular element s E f n H such that the
induced linear mapping Ad
has all eigenvalues equal to 1. This is
then a contradiction.
In what follows we will also need a classification of 3-dimensional Lie algebras.
This can be found in practically any book on Lie algebras.
Theorem 1.6. All 3-dimensional Lie algebras over
are listed below.
If g is nilpotent, then it is either
N1 3-dimensional abelian or
N2 g = (X, Y, z, [X, Y] = Z, [X, Z] = [Y,Z] = 0).
If g is solvable non-nilpotent (SN), then
g = (X, Y,Z; [X, Y] = 0, [X, Z] = aX + j3Y, [Y, Z] = "IX + bY)
where the matrix

is non-degenerate (a, /3, I, 8 E
If g is simple, then it is either
SI
(X, Y, Z; [X, Y] = -2Z, [X, Z] = 2Z, [Y, Z] = X) or
S2 (X, Y,Z; [X, Y] = Z, [X, Z] = -Y, [Y, Z] = X).
Let us mention one important property of lattices in nilpotent Lie groups.
Because we will need it only once in the sequel, we will not prove it. Also, note
that this property is not valid for arbitrary solvable Lie groups.
Theorem 1.7 (Rigidity Theorem) [VGS]. Let f 1 and f 2 be lattices in uilpo-
""
tent Lie groups N 1 and N 2 respectively.
Any isomorphism I'1 --=-. f 2 extends
""
uniquely to an isomorphism of Lie groups N 1 --=-. N 2 .
Example 1.8:
3-dimensional solvmanifolds. Now we want to present a
description of all 3-dimensional solvmanifolds. We discuss it here with the aim
of giving the reader a feeling for the structure of solvmanifolds. In what follows
we will use the standard notation of a semidirect product of groups. That is,
A
><l ¢ B denotes a semidirect product of groups A and B with respect to a
homomorphism 1;: A --+ Aut(B).
Theorem 1.9. There are only two non-diffeomorphic compact 3-dimensional
solvmanifolds

and
G2/f 2
which are not diffeomorphic to nilmanifolds. Explicitly, G1 =

In order to prevent the technical details from obscuring the idea, we first sketch

SOLVMANIFOLDS
Sketch of Proof. A straightforward argument shows that G 1 and G2 are both of
the form lP!. >41> lP!.2. Now, we must find ¢. Since ¢ is a one-parameter subgroup
in GL(lP!.2) , we must look for a one-parameter subgroup in GL(lP!.2) preserving
a lattice in lP!.2.
For each solvmanifold G/f = (lP!. >41> lP!.2)/f, the natural map
'f): G1lP!.2 -
lP!. possesses the property that 'f)(lP!.2n f) is a non-trivial closed sub-
group of lP!. generated by a single element, say, g. Thus, ¢ : lP!. -
GL(lP!.2) is a
one-parameter subgroup going through g. This subgroup can be identified with
either (i) or (ii) and the proof follows.
0
Detailed Proof. 1) We start with the following observation. If G is a connected,
simply connected solvable, non-nilpotent 3-dimensional Lie group with maximal
nilpotent subgroup N and a discrete co-compact subgroup I', then dim N = 2.
To prove this assertion, note that since G is non-nilpotent, dim N # 3. Since it
is solvable, dim N # O. Thus, we must eliminate the case dim N = 1.
To do this, assume that dim N = 1. This implies that dim [G, G] =
I or
dim [G, G] = 0 (since [G, G] eN). Since G is non-abelian, the only possibility is
dim [G, G] = 1. Since [G, G] is a normal subgroup in G, we can define a G-action
on [G, G] by conjugation
1(g)(a) = gag-I,
9 E G,
a E [G,G].
From the Mostow Structure Theorem 1.2, [G, G] n f = N n f = f is infinite
cyclic. Obviously, f is invariant with respect to the f-action on [G, G] induced
by the G-action.
Moreover, 1(-y) acts on f
by automorphisms.
But there are
only two automorphisms of an infinite cyclic group, so there is a subgroup f' C I'
of index 2 such that I" acts trivially on I' n [G, G] = f. (This follows from the
Rigidity Theorem 1.7.)
Now, if H denotes the maximal subgroup in G which
acts trivially on [G, G], then H ::J I" and H is normal from the definition of the
G-action and the normality of [G,G]. Since G/f is compact and I" has finite
index 2 in r, GIf' and, consequently, GI H is compact. Define an action of GI H
on [G,G] by gH(a) = gag- 1 for a E [G,G]. From the compactness of GIH it
follows that this action is neccessarily trivial and this implies that a E Z(G), the
center of G. This means that [G, G] C Z(G) and this implies that G is nilpotent.
This is then the required contradiction.
2) Now, since dim N = 2, it follows that N = lP!.2. Therefore, the group G can
be included into an exact sequence
2
11"
1-lP!. -
G -----> lP!. -1,
where
lP!. = GIN.
Since N is abelian, the factor-group GIN acts on N by
gN(n) = gng- 1 and thus the homomorphism
¢: lP!. -
Aut(N),
determines an isomorphism
¢(gN) = 1(g): N _ N
(2)

SOLVMANIFOLDS AND THEIR MOSTOW BUNDLES

By Theorem 1.2 again, we see that N n I' is a lattice generated by two linearly
independent vectors in JR2. Choosing the appropriate coordinates in JR2 we can
assume that these vectors constitute a standard basis in JR2, ej = (1,0), e2 =
(0, I). Since etc is compact, N n r "tJ r and 7I"(f) C JR becomes a non-trivial
closed subgroup generated by a single element B.
Note that cP(B) preserves a
lattice generated by eI and e2. We have either cP(B) E Aut(JR2) and cP(B)(Nnf) c
N n r, or
At this point we observe that the subgroup r is completely determined. That is,
f = 7lB )<14> (7leI EB 7le2),
with cP(B)(ed and cP(B)(e2) given by (2). Now, we must determine the JR-action
on JR2 by finding a one-parameter subgroup ¢: JR ---+ GL(JR2) for which cP(B) has
values on eI and e2 the same as those given by (2).
Since ¢(B) preserves an
integral lattice in JR2 its matrix with respect to the basis eI and e2 has integral
entries and has determinant either 1, or -1.
Since cP(t) is a one-parameter
subgroup, det cP(B) = 1. Then the possibilities for cP(B) fall into three distinct
cases: (i) the eigenvalues of cP(B) are real and positive, (ii) the eigenvalues of ¢(B)
are real and negative, (iii) the eigenvalues are complex with non-zero imaginary
parts.
In case (i), since cP(B) lies in a one-parameter subgroup, there exists a square
root
=
= cP(B). Notice that ¢(B) may be written in a diagonal
form ¢( B) = diag( AI, A2),for AI> 0, A2 > 0 and it is easy to check that the square
root
must be in the diagonal form
= diag(v1"I, v1"2). This may be
seen by direct calculation. Applying this argument successively and taking the
appropriate square roots, we get cP(tB) = diag(e k t , e- k t ) , where ek t + e- k t i- 2 is
an integer, as required.
Case (ii) can be eliminated because of the impossibility of taking successive
square roots of cP(B).
In case (iii), ¢(B) is conjugate to diag(A, ),), where A), = 1.
Since cP(B) E
GL(JR2) has integer entries, the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial are
also integers and this implies that A+ >. E 7l. The only matrix which satisfies
all conditions above is given by condition (ii) of the theorem. The proof is then
complete.

Now, we can describe a1l4-dimensional solvable Lie groups admitting lattices.
This will be used in the proof of the Benson-Gordon conjecture in dimension 4.
Theorem 1.10. Any simply connected solvable 4-dimensional non-nilpotent Lie
group wbict: admits a lattice has one of the folIowing two forms:
(i) G = JR )<14> N3 , where cP: JR ---+ Aut(N3 ) is a one-parameter subgroup in
Aut(N3 ) such that cP(1)(N3(Q)) c N3(Q) or
(ii) G = JR
)<I JR3, where ¢: JR ---+ GL(JR3) is a one-parameter subgroup such
that cP(1) E GL(7l3 ) .

76
SOLVMANIFOLDS
Proof The proof is based on essentially the same technique as in Theorem 1.9.
Again, take the maximal nilpotent subgroup NeG and use the Mostow bundle
(1). Since G is non-nilpotent and non-abelian, the cases dim N = 0 and dim N =
4 are excluded. To exclude dim N = 1, we can use the argument of Theorem
1.9. It remains to consider the case dim N = 2. Again, the proof of Theorem
1.9 shows that the only unclear case is dim N = 2 and N = [G, G].
However,
since in the 2-dimensional case there is only one possibility, N = 1m. 2 , G can be
included into an exact sequence
2
7r
2
1---->1m. ---->G--.Im.---->1
with
1m.2 = GIN.
Since N is abelian, the factor group GIN acts on N by
gN(n) = gng- 1 and, thus, the homomorphism
¢: 1m.2 ----> Aut(N),
¢(gN) = I(g): N ----> N
determines an isomorphism G == 1m.2
<f>1m.2. Again, since N is normal in G, there is
an action of r on the subgroup N nr by automorphisms 1(,) for, E r. Again,
since G = 1m.2
1m.2 , there are one-parameter subgroups ¢(t) going through
elements 1(,) which, therefore, preserve a lattice r c
1m.2 . Repeating word for
word the argument in the previous theorem, we see that ¢(t) has either form (i)
or form (ii) of Theorem 1.9. The first case, however, must be excluded since ¢(t),
although it preserves r, is not an isomorphism of r. In fact, it is an injective
but not surjective homomorphism which, in the appropriate basis, is given by
(Zl,Z2) ----> (mzl,mz2), for (Zl,Z2) E IZEBIZ, m E IZ, m # 1. In the second case,
we can easily find a subgroup I" of finite index acting trivially on r.
Again,
as in the proof of Theorem 1.9, we take the maximal subgroup H in G acting
trivially on [G, G] and carry out the proof repeating word for word the argument
of Theorem 1.9.
Finally, if N is a 3-dimensional nilpotent Lie group, Theorem 1.6 shows that
either (i) or (ii) holds (the conditions regarding ¢(1) are necessary for the exis-
tence of a lattice). The proof is then complete.

We complete this section with the following important property of solvman-
ifolds either of low dimension (by [AuSz]) or of the form GIr (by Theorem
2.3.11).
Theorelll 1.11 [AuSz]. Any compact orientable solvmanifold which either has
dimension less than or equal to 4 or is of the form GIr is parallelizable.
Of course, there are many non-parallelizable solvmanifolds such as the Klein
bottle (i.e.
it is non-orientable). Auslander and Szczarba also constructed ex-
amples of non-parallelizable solvmanifolds in higher dimensions.

COHOMOLOGY OF SOLVMANIFOLDS: HATTORI'S THEOREM
77
2. Cohomology of Solvrnanifolds: Hattori's Theorem
First recall that Nomizu's theorem implies that the Chevalley-Eilenberg com-
plex (An*, 6) turns out to be the minimal model of a nilmanifold NIf (see The-
orem 2.1.3). In this respect, arbitrary solvmanifolds differ essentially from nil-
manifolds. In general, the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex
(Ag*,6)
is not even a model for GIf since there are examples of solvmanifolds GIf such
that
H*(Ag*, 6) 'F H*(G/r)·
However, in the special case of completely solvable Lie groups G, the problem
of calculating the cohomology of G/f can be settled by Hattori's theorem. The
technique which is necessary for proving this result is of great importance. While
the original proof is given in [Hat], we present here a more'rational-homotopic'
and simplified version. Note that results of Benson-Gordon, Fernandez-Saralegi-
de Leon and others cover the completely solvable case and are heavily based on
Hattori's theorem.
Definition 2.1. A solvmanifold GIf is called completely solvable if the Lie
algebra 9 satisfies the condition that all linear operators ad V : 9 --+ 9 have only
real eigenvalues for all V E g.
In general this condition does not hold (see Example 2.4 below).
Example 2.2. In dimension 3, the solvmanifold Gdf l of Theorem 1.9 is com-
pletely solvable since the Lie algebra gl is of the form
gl = (X, Y, Z; [X, Y] = kY, [X, Z] = -kZ, [Y, Z] = 0,
k E lR).
Example 2.3. Every nilmanifold is completely solvable.
Example 2.4. In dimension 3, the solvmanifold G2/f 2 of Theorem 1.9 is not
completely solvable since
9 = (X, Y, Z; [X, Y] = Z, [X, Z] =- Y)
and ad(X) has imaginary eigenvalues.
The theorem below is the main result of this section.
Hattori's Theorem [Hat].
For any compact solvmanifold with completely solv-
able simply connected Lie group G tbere exists a quasi­isomorphism

78
SOLVMANIFOLDS
and, therefore, the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Ag*, 8) is a model (not minimal
in general) ofG/f.
In particular, note that, if G is nilpotent, then Nomizu's theorem is recovered.
The proof of this theorem requires the development of the machinery of the
Leray-Serre type spectral sequence associated with a locally trivial smooth fiber
bundle (cf.
[GrM, McC]). To make the proof more comprehensible, we first
describe the main idea and then complete the details.
Sketch of Proof. Take the Mostow bundle (I) associated with a solvmanifold
G/f. Let E = G/f and denote by F and B respectively, the fiber and the base
of the Mostow bundle.
Consider the Leray-Serre spectral sequence (E;'*, dr )
associated with this bundle. As usual,
Consider now the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Ag*, 8) and, using the embed-
ding (Ag*, 8) C r2 D R(E), define a filtration on (Ag*, 8) inherited from r2 D R(E).
The corresponding spectral sequence (E;'* ,dr ) converges to H* (Ag*,8). To prove
the required isomorphism H*(Ag*, 8) == H*(G/f) we want to use the spectral
sequences (E;'*,dr ) and (E;'*,dr ) .
It turns out that there is a commutative
diagram
where n denotes (as before) the maximal nilpotent subalgebra in g. Now the idea
is quite clear. Try to use in.duciion with respect to the dimension of g. Assuming
that the required isomorphism has been already proved for all Lie groups of
dimensions < n and taking dim G = n, apply the above diagram. The bottom
row of the diagram will yield an isomorphism by the induction hypothesis. Thus
E· p,q "" EP,q

for all p, q, and the standard technique of spectral sequences [McC] implies the
required isomorphism. However, here we meet a difficulty which requires a rather
subtle analysis. Indeed, this is the reason why the theorem is not true for arbi-
trary solvmanifolds. To apply the induction hypothesis, we must assume that a
stronger condition holds. Namely, we must assume
H*(Ag*,F) == H*(G/f,F)
for the cohomology with coefficients in a g-module (this is precisely the situation
we meet considering the previous diagram where F = H*(An*)). Then we must
prove the latter isomorphism for dim g =
1.
It zs here that the condition of
complete solvability ss used and the proof can be completed.

COHOMOLOGY OF SOLYMANIFOLDS: HATTORI'S THEOREM

Details of Proof. Let us start with the following version of the Leray-Serre spec-
tral sequence. Consider the locally trivial fiber bundle
i
7f
F
-------> E
-------> B
(3)
and let F be a COO (E)-module. Assume that the Lie algebra X(E) of all smooth
vector fields on E operates on F. By definition, this means that there is a map
X(E) x F
----+ F, (X, u) f--+ Xu satisfying the conditions
(1) X(fu) = (Xf)u + f(Xu), for f E cOO(E), U E F,
(2) (fX)u = f(Xu), for f E cOO(E), U E F,
(3) [X, Y]u = X(Yu) - Y(Xu), for X, Y E X(E).
Given a pair (E, F) such that X(E) operates on F, we can define a twisted de
Rham complex
(O(E,F),dF )
of differential forms with values in a COO (E)-module F. Namely, OP(E, F) con-
sists of all alternating COO (E)-linear maps w: X(E) x ... x X(E) ----+:F.
The
differential dF is defined formally by the same rule as the usual de Rham differ-
ential in ODR(E),
The difference between d and dF is hidden in the notation XiW since now the
value of W is an element of F on which X operates. Given a bundle (3), we define
a filtration on the twisted de Rham complex (O(E, F), dF ) as follows:
FP(Op+q (E, F) = {w E Op+q (E, F)I We (VI, ... , Vp+q) =a
whenever
Vi 1 , ..•
, Vi p+1 E Ker( dt:e)}
for all e E E.
Here of course,
VI, ... ,Vp+q E Te(E).
Since E is a manifold,
OS (E, F) = afor s > dim E and, therefore, the filtration
... =::J •.. =::J FPOp+q(E,F) =::J .•. =::J ...
is a bounded decreasing filtration.
The standard construction of the spectral
sequence associated with a filtration [McC) shows that there exists a first quad-
rant spectral sequence (E;'*, dr ) converging to the cohomology of the twisted de
Rham complex H*(O, F). Thus,

SOLVMANIFOLDS
is a spectral sequence which will be called in the sequel the Lerau-Serre spectral
sequence associated with a locally trivial smooth fiber bundle (3). This will be the
first of two spectral sequences we need to prove the generalized isomorphism (*).
The second spectral sequence is associated with the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex
with ualues in a g-module U.
Here we assume that a g-module U is a finite
dimensional vector space on which g operates via a representation A: g ----> g[(U).
Define the complex
(A(g*,U),8u )
in the same manner as rl(E,F): AP(g*,U) consists of all alternating IP?,-linear
maps (): g x ... x g ----> U. The differential 8u is defined formally by the same
expression as dF . Interpreting g as the Lie algebra of invariant vector fields on
G, one can define a filtration on A(g*, U) in precisely the same manner as on
rl(E, F). Namely,
FPAp+q(g*,U) = {w E Ap+q(g*,U)1 W(Vl, ... ,VP+q) = 0
whenever
Vi"
... , Vi p+1 E Ker(d7l'e)}.
Here, of course, E is not arbitrary, but denotes GIf and Vi is interpreted as a
tangent vector obtained from an invariant vector field on G projected on GIf. So,
in what follows, (3) denotes the Mostow bundle. Again, we get a first quadrant
spectral sequence (E;,*,dr ) converging to H*(A(g*,U),8u ).
Finally, we have obtained two spectral sequences which we may compare to
yield the proof. We write
(E;'*,dr )
===> H*(rl,:F),
(E;",dr )
===> H*(g,U).
Here and in the sequel we write H*(g,U) instead of H*(A(g*,U),8u ). The fol-
lowing lemma is the main tool enabling us to compare these spectral sequences.
In order to formulate it, we introduce, first, the following definition.
Definition 2.5. A vector field X on E is called vertical if at each point x in E its
value at x is a tangent vector to the fiber going through this point: Xx E Tx(F).
Denote by Xv (E) the set of all vertical vector fields in E. Restricting differ-
ential forms with values in the COO (E)-module F to vertical vector fields, we get
a complex
(rlv ( E, F), dF).
Now W E rlv(E,F) denotes an alternating map w: Xv(E) x ... x Xv(E) ---->:F.
Since Xv(E) is an IP?,-Lie subalgebra in X(E), dF is well-defined by the same rule
as before. From now until the end of this section, we consider only the particular
x(E)-module F, where
F = COO(E) c>9 U,
and U is a finite dimensional vector space over IP?,.

Lemrna 2.6. The following isomorphisms are valid:
where H" (n, U) is celculeied with respect to the g-module U considered as an n-
module, Hq(flv(E, F)) denotes the cohomology of the twisted de Rham complex
of vertical forms on F with values in a Coo (E)-module :F and Hq(flv(E,F)) is
endowed with an appropriate structure ofa Coo (B)-module on which x( B) oper-
ates. The latter structure is determined by a natural embedding p* : Coo (B) -->
cOO(E), p*(J) = fop for the bundle map p: E --> B.
Proof of Lemma 2.6. The proof, in fact, is based on a direct (although somewhat
technical) calculation of E 2-term s in both spectral sequences. We calculate suc-
cessively
do),
dd and E;'* and then repeat the same procedure for
(E;'*,dr ) , r = 0,1,2.
Introduce any connection in the bundle F

--> B (in our approach we
assume the existence of a horizontal distribution Q C T(E) satisfying the lifting
property for curves in B [Hat]). As usual, this connection yields a COO (B)­linear
lifting map
I: X(B) --> X(E),
X
--> X = I(X).
Now, we want to calculate
Define, first, a map
where Xi E X(E) for all i. One can verify by direct calculation that the kernel of
this map is FP+lflp+q and that 'Pp,q commutes with the differentials. Denote by

to vertical vector fields. Then the following map

Note that this calculation is straightforward and is still valid for any F. Now we
begin the calculation of Ef,q. Consider
,* = EBp,qflP(B,

definition of the differential do in the spectral sequence (E;'*, dr ) we can deduce

that do is identified with the differential d' on ffip,qflP(B, flZ(E, F)) given by the
formula
d'w(X j , ••. ,Xp ) = (-I)PdF(w(X j , ••• ,Xp ) ) ,
Xi E X(B), i = 1, ... ,p.
On the other hand, EBp,qflP(B, flZ(E, F)) has already been endowed with the
natural differential. Let (Zp,q)' and (BP,q)' denote the subspaces of cocycles and
coboundaries with respect to d'. Obviously, Ef,q = (Zp,q)' j(BP,q),.
Introduce
also the notation zq for the subspace of cocycles in flv(E, F) and B" for the cor-
responding subspace of coboundaries with respect to dF . Obviously, the natural
projection zq ­
Hq(flv(E,F)) induces a natural map

with kernel flP(B, Bq). Obviously,
Therefore, we get a natural map

Now, >. is injective if and only if
(BP,q)' = flP(B, Bq)
and >. is surjective if and only if the map

flP(B, Hq(fl v(E, F)))
is surjective. The proof of the latter two facts is straightforward. For instance,
let e: X(B) x ... x X(B) ­
Hq(flv(E,F)) be a differential form with values in
Hq(flv(E,F)). Then e(X j , ••. ,Xp) = [w]x"
.x.: The problem is, in fact, to
find a canonical choice of representatives in all cohomology classes. In general
it is not possible, but since F = COO(E) Q?I U, where U is finite dimensional and
E is compact, the corresponding cohomology is finite dimensional and we can
choose representatives for cohomology classes in an arbitrary way (note that if
w E flv(E, COO(E) Q?I U), then w = Li (XiWi, (Xi E JPI., where Wi: Xv(E) x ... x
Xv(E) ­
COO(E) is a usual de Rham form for any i).

Remark 2.7. In Hattori's paper [Hat], the proof is more general since he con-
siders cohomology with coefficients in arbitrary sheaves.

Now, complete solvability comes into play.

COHOMOLOGY OF SOLVMANIFOLDS: HATTORI'S THEOREM

Definition 2.8. Let 9 be a finite dimensional Lie algebra and let U be a finite
dimensional vector space over K
A representation>. : 9 -l- g£(U) is called iruin-
gular if there exists a sequence U = Uo :::l U l :::l ... :::l Un = {O} of subspaces of U
such that dim Ui = dim Ui+l + I, 0
i
n and each Ui is invariant under >.(g).
In this case, the g-module U is called triangular.
Let G be a simply connected Lie group and I' be a lattice.
Notice that for
each finite dimensional g-module U, the x( G)-module II =U <9 Coo(GIf) is well-
defined.
Indeed, since GIf is compact, each vector field X
E X(GIf) can be
represented as X = Li fiXi, where Ii E Coo(GIf) and Xi are invariant in the
sense that they are obtained by projecting left-invariant vector fields on G (and,
therefore, the Xi are identified with elements in g). Then,
Xu = LfiXiu,
U E U, Xi E g.

denote a natural map of cochain complexes induced by tile embedding U

U
f-4 U Ci9 1. Assume that U is a triangular g­module. Then the map 'P induces
isomorphisms
'P;: HP(g,U) -l- HP(G/f,ll)
for each p 2': O. Here HP(G/f,U) denotes HP(O(G/f,U),dfj).
Proof of Lemma 2.9. The proof is accomplished by induction with respect to the
dimension of g. The first step is made for dim 9 = 1. Note that in this case 9 = !Fl.,
GIf = 5 l and we must check the required isomorphisms for p = 0 and p = 1
(because of dimensional reasons). In this case the calculation is straightforward
and requires only some elementary argument with ordinary differential equations.
Namely, note that for 9 = !Fl., GIf = SI and the vector field X =
(considered
as a generator in 9 or as a projected vector field on 51 using the same notation),
the following differential equations have a unique solution:
Xh + f = b,
Xh + ah + f = b,
s c: !FI.
a, bE!FI.
(4)
(5)
where the unknowns are hand b in the former and h E COO(Sl) in the latter.
The proof of (4) and (5) is quite elementary and we leave it to the reader (who
may also consult [Hat, Lemma 4.2, p.
32.5]).
The next observation is based
on a straightforward calculation of cohomologies in degrees 0 and 1 from the
definition. We get:

SOLVMANIFOLDS
Hq(Wi.,U) = Hq(SI ,[1) = 0,
q> 1,
where XU = {u E UI u = Xu'} and x[1 = {u E [11 u = Xu'}. One can see that
'P* induces natural maps
We claim that these maps are bijective for any triangular module U. To prove
this, take a basis el, ... , em of U such that
x-, = Laijej.

(6)
Then elements of U are written uniquely in the form Li j;ei with fi E COO(Sl)
and Li fiei E U if and only if fi E Wi.. We prove, first, the surjectivity of U X
--->
ax. Assume that X(Li fiei) = O. Since X(Li fiei) = Li(Xf;)ei + j;(Xe;), it
follows from (4) and (5) that
X i« + annfn = 0 ==> fn E Wi..
By induction (whose possibility is guaranteed by (6)) we easily get j; E Wi. for all
i, or Li j;ei E U as required. The injeetivity is obvious. To show the bijectivity
of the second map UI XU --+ aI Xa, we reformulate this condition as follows:
(i) for any f E COO(SI) and k, 1 :S k :S p there exist hi E coo(Sl) and
Ci E Wi. such that
fek = X

(ii) If X(Li j;ei) = Li c.e, with fi E COO(Sl) and Ci E Wi., then j; E Wi..
Now, since we have
X (t, hiei) +t, c.e, = (Xh k + auhk + ck)ek
+ (Xhk- 1 + ak-l,k-1hk- 1 + ak.k-lhk
+ ck-I)ek-l + ...
we can determine (by (5)) hk, Ck, hk_ I, Ck -I, ... inductively to satisfy
X hk + au hk + Ck = f
Xhk_1 + ak-I,khk-l + ak,k-1hk + Ck-l = 0,

which implies (i) and (ii) and, hence, the proof of Lemma 2.9 in the case dim g =
1.
Assume that Lemma 2.9 holds for all g such that dim g < n. Consider a solv-
able Lie algebra g of dimension n. Then either g is non­nilpotent or it is nilpotent.
In the first case, take a maximal nilpotent sub algebra n, which obviously satis-
fies the inequality dim n < dim g, and construct the pair of spectral sequences
(E;'*, dr ) , (E;'*, dr ) with respect to the modules U and U. The following diagram
is commutative (Lemma 2.6).
Here U = Coo(GIf) (2)U. Now, we can check by direct calculation using only the
definition that H" (n, U) is a triangular gin­module (we leave the details for the
reader who may also consult [Hat, p.328]). Since dim(g/n) < n and dim n < n,
we can use the induction hypothesis as follows. First,
HP(g/n, Hq(n,U)) == HP(B, Hq(n,U))
where Hq(n,U) = COO(GINf) (2) Hq(n,U). We claim that
and note that, if we have proved this, then the whole proof would be complete.
Thus, our aim now is the proof of this isomorphism.
Note, first, that
for each point b E B and the corresponding fiber Fi over b. Notice that each
alternating map w: nx ... x n -> U can be naturally extended to the corresponding
alternating map w: X(Fb) x ... x X(Fb) -> Coo(Fb)(2)U (since each vector field X
on Fb can be represented as a COO (Fb)­linear combination Li !iXi where Xi are
invariant vector fields on Fi = NINn I' determined by Xi E n. Define a map
where
(f (2)w)e(X1,,,, ,Xp) = j(b)We(X1IFb'"" ,XpIFb )
and b= 1l"(e). It is easy to verify that C is well defined on the cohomology level.
The proof is straightforward and uses only the previous isomorphism between
Hs (n, U) and the corresponding cohomology of the fiber (which, in turn, follows
from the induction hypothesis). Moreover, the same isomorphism shows that the
corresponding map is injective. The surjectivity of
is proved as follows.

Let [0] be an element in Hq(rlv(E, Coo(E) &JU)). Then, for each b E B, [O!Fb]

vector space, [w](b) = Li j;(b)[W]i, where the [W]i constitute a basis of Hq(n,U).
Since 0 is smooth, the functions fi are in Coo(B) and we get a well-defined map

RATIONAL MODELS OF SOLVMANIFOLDS
3. Rational Models of Solvmanifolds
with Kahler Structures
87
In Chapter 2 we have shown that rational homotopy models allowed us to ef-
fecti vely detect symplectic and (non)­Kahler nilmanifolds because the Chevalley-
Eilenberg complex (An*, 8) (which turned out to be the minimal model of NIf)
contains all necessary information. In the solvmanifold case, however, the prob-
lem appears to be much more difficult. In fact, examples show that one must look
for more refined invariants. To reveal the difficulties, we begin with an example
constructed by Fernandez and Gray in [FG2].
Example 3.1. The following theorem shows that there are symplectic solvman-
ifolds which carry no Kahler structures but which non-detectable from Kahler
manifolds by cohomological invariants or by the property offormality. Let Gdr 1
be a compact solvmanifold given by Example 1.8. Recall that G l =
and
4;(t) is a one­parameter subgroup defined by the formula 4;(t) = diag(ek t , e- kt )
where ek + e- k # 2 is an integer.
Theorem 3.2. Let M 4 denotes the solvmanifold (Gdfd x 51. Then
(i) M 4 is a compact symplectic solvmanifold;
(ii) M 4 has no complex structures (and, therefore, has no Kahler structures
either);
(iii)
M 4 is formal;
(iv)
is a Lefschetz algebra.
Proof. We begin with the proof of part (i). Calculating the Chevalley­Eilenberg
complex for the Lie algebra 9 = gl EEl
we get
(Ag*,8) = A(z,h,x,y)
8z = bh. = 0, 8x = -hx, 8y = hy,
deg(z) = deg(h) = deg(x) = deg(y) = 1
(7),
since, without loss of generality, 9 = (Z, H, X, YI [H, X] = X, [H, Y] = -Y)
(with all other brackets zero as in Theorem 1.10). Now we see that the element
w=zl\h+xl\y
represents a cohomologically symplectic element. Recall that (Ag*, 8) represents
invariant differential forms on G which implies that w 2 is nowhere vanishing in-
variant form and, hence, w is non­degenerate. Finally, w descends to a symplectic
form on G/f.
Proof of (ii).
We want to show the non­existence of complex structures on
M 4 . This is done by appealing to classification theorems of Kodaira and Yau
that are specific to complex dimension 2. Suppose the contrary.
Since M 4 is
parallelizable (Theorem 1.11), its Euler characteristic and the first Pontryagin

88
SOLVMANIFOLDS
number vanish and this implies the vanishing of the Chern numbers and the
geometric genus Pg of M 4 :
(8)
Then, from the Kodaira classification of complex surfaces [BPV], it follows that
M 4 is an algebraic variety. Indeed, from the classification table in [BPV, table 10,
p. 188], we notice that this is the only possibilty compatible with (8). However,
the same table yields b}(M 4 ) = 2, but the latter condition together with (8) is
not compatible with the Yau classification of compact complex surfaces in [Y].
Proof of (iii).
Note that M 4 is completely solvable and hence the Hattori
theorem is applicable. This means that the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Ag*, b)
is a model (not minimal) for GIl'. However, the minimal model of (Ag*, b) can
be calculated explicitly by taking (M, d) to be defined by the formulas
(M, d) = (A(x, h) C9lR!.[X] C9 A(Y),d)
dz = dh = 0,
deg(z) = deg(h) = 1,
dX = 0,
dy = X 2 ,
deg(X) = 2,
deg(y) = 3.
We also have a morphism 7jJ: (M, d) ----> (Ag*, b) as follows:
1/J(z) = z , 'Ij!(h) = h, 1/!(X) = x 1\ y, 1/J(fj) = o.
A straightforward calculation shows that 1/J is a quasi-isomorphism. Thus, we
have found the minimal model of GIl'. This graded differential algebra is ob-
viously formal, since the DGA-map p: (M,d)
----> H*(M,d),p(z) = [z],p(h) =
[h],p(X) = [X]' p(fj) = 0 is a quasi-isomorphism.
To prove (iv), note that (M, d)
(MS2XT2, d) (M4 has rational homotopy
type of a K iihler manifold T 2 x 8 2 ) .
(We note that the terminology 'rational
homotopy type' in the non-simply connected situation essentially means 'has the
same minimal model'.) This means that H*(M, d) is a Lefschetz algebra. The
proof of (iv) and the whole theorem is now complete.
0
This example reveals all the essential difficulties which can be met when con-
sidering the solvmanifold case. Notice that minimal models themselves, as well
as the Hard Lefschetz Theorem, are not sufficient to settle the problem. More
refined invariants are necessary. In dimension 4, these invariants may come from
the Kodaira classification of compact complex surfaces.
Also, the Chevalley-
Eilenberg complex in general contains less rational homotopic information than
a 'free model' of GIl'. Moreover, because our solvmanifolds are, in general, not
completely solvable, the calculation of their cohomologies instead must be made
using a theorem of Y. Felix and J .C. Thomas from rational homotopy theory.
This type of 'model' will allow us to continue our attack on the problem. The
model is provided by Theorem 1.4.6 as applied to the Mostow bundle. We shall

RATIONAL MODELS OF SOLVMANIFOLDS
89
use our calculation of solvmanifold cohomology via the Felix-Thomas theorem to
verify the Benson-Gordon conjecture for solvmanifolds of dimension four.
Consider the Mostow bundle associated with a solvmanifold GIf. For conve-
nience, we will use the simpler notation
where N denotes thc fiber (which is a nilmanifold) and T denotes the base which
IS a torus. The action of 71"1 (T) on H* (N) is non-nilpotent, so the Serre spectral
sequence is of little use in calculating H* (5).
Also, as we mentioned above,
Hattori's result does not apply to solvmanifolds in general, so our approach to
applying the Felix-Thomas theorem should find wide use. The main difficulty in
trying to apply the result is the possible lack of information about the action of
the fundamental group of the base on the cohomology of the fibre. We show that
this problem can be overcome in the case of the Mostow fibrations associated to
our constructions by understanding actions on the Lie algebra n (and its dual
n*) of the nilpotent Lie group N.
Exarnple 3.3: The Klein Bottle. One of the simplest examples of a solvman-
ifold is the Klein bottle K, The Mostow fibration associated to the Klein bottle
IS
with 71"1 (51) = z:: acting on HI (51) = z:: as the negative of the identity.
This
action is clearly non-nilpotent so that U = {OJ. Theorem 1.4.6 then gives the
rational (or real) cohomology of the Klein bottle as that of a circle. Of course this
agrees with standard calculations. As we mentioned before, however, it should
be noted that the Klein bottle is not a solvmanifold of the form GIf.
Now, we will present a general construction of certain types of solvmanifolds
and analyze the action of the fundamental group of the base on the fibre in the
Mostow fibration. We start with the simplest case. Recall that by Theorem 2.12
in [Rag, Chapter II] a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N admits a lattice
I' if and only if the Lie algebra n has a basis in which all structural constants are
rational. In the latter case, denote by no the vector space generated over Q by
this basis and take a lattice L of maximal rank in n lying in no. Then, exp L is
a lattice in N. Conversely, if I' is a lattice in N, a Z::-submodule in n generated
by exp -1 (r) is a lattice of maximal rank in n.
Example 3.4: The Construction of Certain Solvrnarrifolds. Let ¢:
-+
Aut(n) denote a one-parameter subgroup of the automorphism group of the
nilpotent Lie algebra n such that each ¢(t) preserves the lattice L.
Because
the corresponding nilpotent Lie group N is simply connected, ¢ may be 'lifted'
uniquely to a one-parameter subgroup
-+ Aut(N) with
= ¢(t) for
each t ([War Theorem 3.27, 3.57]). Furthermore, each J(t) will preserve the lat-
tice f. Also, note that automorphisms of n correspond to derivations of n under
the exponential map, exp: Der(n) -+ Aut(n), so we can take 1/)(t) E Der(n) with

90
SOLVMANIFOLDS
exp( 1/)(t)) = cf;(t), a fact we shall make use of shortly. Now form the semi-direct
product
G=ill!.)<l,j;N
where (r, n)(r', n') = (r + r', n+ J(r)(n')), and note that G is solvable since N is
nilpotent and ill!. is abelian. The solvable Lie algebra of this semi-direct product
is a semi-direct product of Lie algebras
fl = ill!. )<lVI n
using the derivations 'l/)(t). We then choose a lattice of the form I' = 20 )<l,j; f in
G and form the solvmanifold
G
5= =r
with Mostow fibration
N = N /f -+ 5 -+ ill!./20 = 8 1 .
This approach may be extended in the obvious way by considering k-parameter
subgroups of automorphisms ill!.k -+ Aut(n), ill!.k -+ Aut(N) and derivations ill!.k -+
Der(n).
This approach is, of course, not the most general way to construct
solvmanifolds, but, as we shall see below, it does provide an effective means for
constructing examples based on a knowledge of the automorphism group of a
nilpotent Lie algebra. We also point out that it is sometimes convenient to first
choose the derivation of the Lie algebra n and attempt to exponentiate it to a
reasonable automorphism.
Example 3.5:
The Action of the Fundamental Group. For a general
Mostow fibration, N
-+ 5
-+ T, associated to a solvrnanifold 5, in order to
understand the action of 1rl (T) on H* (N), we must recall several homotopical
and bundle-theoretic facts. First, we must note that the Mostow fibration is, in
fact, a Steenrod fibre bundle with structure group .vr/f 0, where I'0 is the largest
normal sugroup of I' which is normal in .vr. Now, if F -+ E -+ B is a bundle
with structure group H, then elementary bundle theory provides a diagram

Also, P XH F denotes the quotient (P x F)/ H by the diagonal action and the
right vertical column denotes the Borel fibration for the action of H on F with
F H = E H x H F.
There is a well known 'holonomy' action of the loop space
of the base on the fibre and this action is known to be natural with respect to
bundle maps. Therefore, we have a diagram
fJB x F

F

II

so that the holonomy action is naturally related to the structure group action on

where [F, F] denotes the set of free homotopy classes of self maps of F. Thus,
Proposition 3.6. If F -> E -> B is a fibre bundle with structure group H,
then the action of the fundamental group of the base on the homology of the
fibre factors through the component group Jro( H) of the structural group of the
bundle.
There is yet another more algebraic way to understand this action. Consider
an embedded circle 5] -> T which gives a generator for Jr] (T) and pull back the

SOLVMANIFOLDS
with a splitting s: IZ ---+ 71"1(5') since IZ is free. This gives 71"1(5') the structure of
a semi-direct product and the splitting s provides an outer action of IZ on 71"1 (N).
Specifically, if 0: E IZ, then for any x E 71"1 (N), we may take 0: . X = s( 0: )xs(0:)-1,
conjugation of x in the group 71"1(5')
71"1(5). This 'action' is not well defined
however because it depends on the particular splitting s chosen. The action is
defined, however, up to conjugation in 7I"1(N). To see this, let r : IZ ---+ 71"1(5') be
another splitting and let s(o:) = (), r(o:) = T where 0: generates IZ. Then there is
some g E 71"1(5') with T = g () and, because () and T both project to 0: in LZ, by
exactness it must be the case that g = n E 7I"1(N). Hence, for any x E 7I"1(N),
TXT-1= (n (})x(n (})-1)
n((}x(}-I)n- 1
and the conjugations are the same up to a conjugation inside 71"1 (N) itself. Now,
N = K (71"1 (N), 1) is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space and it is well known that
the free homotopy classes of self maps of such spaces correspond to conjugacy
classes of self homomorphisms of the fundamental groups. Thus, again the action
of the fundamental group of the base is reflected in a free homotopy action on
the fibre. Further, every element in a free homotopy class has the same effect on
(co)homology, so the action of 7I"1(T) on H*(N) is well defined.
Now, because
7I"1(T) is the fundamental group of a product of circles and each pullback has
71"1(5')
---+ 71"1(5) injective, it is clear that we can understand the action in the
entire Mostow fibration as conjugation in 71"1 (5). We state this as
Theorem 3.7. For the Mostow fibration N
---+ 5
---+ T associated to a solvuuui-
ifold 5, the action Of7l"1(T) on H*(N) is through conjugation in 71"1(5).
Of course, we also point out that if we start with a semi-direct product 71"1 (5) =
IZ
)4 ¢ I', then conjugation of I' by IZ in 71"1 (5) corresponds to the action of the
automorphism J;
(0:,1)(0, ,)(0:,1)-1 = (0:, 1)(0,,)(-0:,1)
= (0:, J(o:)(t))(-0:,1)
= (0, J(o:)(,)).
An important thing to realize in the discussion above is that the structure
group action for the Mostow fibration is given by left translation
NfIfax .vrIf ---+ .vrIf
and, for the solvmanifolds constructed in 3.4, this may be detected at the Lie
algebra level in a simple way. Hattori's theorem gives an isomorphism H*(N) '=
H*(An*,8) and the transpose of the ¢ action on n corresponds to the action of
71"1(51). For a solvmanifold constructed as in 3.4,

where I' is a lattice in Nand 1rl(S) ==;z, >4J I', this follows because the action J
extends uniquely to a lattice preserving action on N and this in turn provides
the original chosen action

Theorem 3.8. For the examples S constructed in example 3.4, the action of
1rl(Sl) =;z, on H*(N) = H*(1rl(N)) = H*(f) is given by:
(1) restricting ¢J: lFI. -+ Aut(n) to 1J:;z, -+ Aut(n)
(2)
taking the dual automorphisms ¢Jt: ;z, -+ Aut(n*)
(3) extending to the exterior algebra A¢t: ;z, -+ Aut(An*) as differential
graded algebra maps
(4)
and taking the induced automorphisms on cohomology (A¢t)*: ;z,
-+
Aut(H*(An*,6)).

SOLVMANIFOLDS
Instead of looking at the action on H*(An*, 8) directly, we observe that the
differential graded algebra (An*, 8) is generated as an exterior algebra by n*.
Thus, knowing the action ¢ on n" will determine the action completely. Before
we consider more general cases, let us look at two particular examples.
Example 3.9 [BG2]. Let N =
IR<. x
IR<. with n =
IR<. EB
IR<. and take the map
'l/J:
IR<. -t Der(n) defined by
'¢(t) =
Note that '¢( 1) = A is the derivation of n =< X, Y > given by
A(X) = X
and
A(Y) = -Y.
If we exponentiate '¢(t), we obtain the automorphism of n,
with precisely the same matrix form for the automorphism J of the underly-
ing abelian Lie group
IR<.2.
Choose to = In(.\), where the matrix B = ¢(to)
is in 5L(2,.2:) and has distinct real eigenvalues .\ and 1/.\.
Then, because
B E 5L(2, .2:), there is a lattice r in m.2 which is invariant under the group
generated by B. Hence, we may form the solvmanifold
where the .2: factor is generated by to. Now let us compute the cohomology of
S using the Felix­Thomas Theorem 1.4.6.
First, notice that, by construction,
the action of the generator of .2:, to, on n is given by ¢(to) = B = B t and that
B t does not act nilpotently on n*.
Because n = 1m.2 , H* (A n* ,8) = An", so the
action of B' on H1(An*, 8) = n" is non­nilpotent as well. On the other hand,
because An* is exterior, any linear transformation of n" induces multiplication
on Adim(n*)n* by the determinant of the transformation. Thus, since n is two
dimensional, A 2Bt is given by det(B t ) =.\. 0/.\) = 1. Therefore, the action on
H 2(An*) is trivial and, so, nilpotent. The Felix­Thomas theorem then says that
the minimal fibre (AY, dy ) of the K.S. extension corresponding to the Mostow
fibration of 5 must be a model for the nilpotent 71"1 (8 1 ) = .2: module
u = { HO(An*, 8) = <Q
H 2(An*, 8) = <Q.
Such a cohomology algebra can only be modeled by the minimal model of the
2­sphere, (A(X2, Y3), dx = 0, dy = x 2). Therefore, since the minimal model for
the circle is simply (A(Zl), dz = 0), the K.S. model for 5 must be

RATIONAL MODELS OF SOLVMANIFOLDS
95
The differentials are defined without twisting because of the K.S. condition and
the fact that z2 = O. The DGA A is a minimal model for the space 51 x 52 so
that the solvmanifold 8 has the cohomology of a product of spheres. Moreover,
8 x 8 1 is a solvmanifold with the cohomology of the Kahler manifold T 2 x 8 2 .
Remark 3.10. In [BG2], the calculation of the cohomology of 8 as in Example
3.9 is made by appealing to the Hattori theorem. In the example above,
9 = (A, X, Y: [X, Y] = 0, [A,X] = X, [A, Y] == -Y)
so that the the eigenvalues for all ad(-) transformations are clearly real. Thus,
Hattori's theorem applies here.
We shall see, however, that the Felix-Thomas
result allows us to calculate in the non-completely solvable case as well.
Example 3.11. Let n denote the Lie algebra n = (X, Y, Z: [X, Y] = Z, [X, Z] =
0, [Y, Z] = 0) associated to the three dimensional Heisenberg group N of 3 x 3
upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal. Let ¢:
--+ Aut(n) denote
the one parameter subgroup of autornorphisms of n defined by
¢(t) =
In the basis {X, Y, Z}, we have
(
COS t
-
t
sin t
cost
o
¢(t)(X) == cos(t)X - sin(t)Y
¢(t)(Y) = sin(t)X + cos(t)Y
¢(t)(Z) = Z
and we check easily that brackets are preserved. The automorphisms ¢J(t) are
the exponential images of derivations
W(f)
D
so that, if we set A = 1b(1), then we can define a new solvable Lie algebra by
taking
9 = (A, X, Y, Z, : [X, Y] = Z, [A, X] == -Y, [A,Y] = X, [-, Z] = 0).
where [-, Z] = 0 denotes that all brackets with Z are zero. Again we may lift ¢J
to a one parameter group of automorphisms ¢ of the Heisenberg group Nand
form the solvable Lie group G =
)clJ, N with solvmanifold
S' -

where r is a lattice in N. Here, we note that, in the basis {X, Y, Z}, the trans-
formation ¢;( 1r/2) preserves the lattice X;Z: + y;z: + Z;Z: in n.
Therefore, the
automorphisms of N J ¢(1r/2)n J preserve the lattice r in N for all n. Hence, the
solvmanifold is well defined. Again we can look at the action of the generator
B = ¢;( 1r/2)t on n* and we see that we obtain
B(X*)=Y*,
B(Y*)=-X*J
B(Z*)=Z*.
Now, A2n* =< X*Y*,X*Z*JY*Z* > and A3n* =< x*y*z* > with O(X*) =
b(Y*) = 0 and b(Z*) = X*Y*J so that
{
HO(An*, b) =o
H l(An* b) =< X* Y* >
H* An" 0 =

H 2(An*,b)=<X*Z*,Y*Z*>
H 3(An*, b) =< X*y*Z* >
with maximal nilpotent module

u =
H 3(An*, b) =o
Again, the minimal differential graded algebra with this cohomology is the min-
imal model of a sphere 53, (A(X3), d = 0). Thus, to build the K.S. extension, we
require
A(ZI, X3)
with differential
dz = 0, dx = 0
for degree reasons. Hence, the cohomology of the solvmanifold 5 is isomorphic
to that of 51 x 53. Indeed, by the general laws of rational homotopy, the DGA
homomorphism ('\(z, x), d) --+ A(5) may be lifted to the minimal model M(S)
and this DGA homomorphism may be realized as a map from the <Ql­completion
of 5 to the <Ql­Iocalization of 51 x S3.
Finally, note that, in g, the matrix for
ad(A) is given by
ad(A):
H)
and this matrix has characteristic polynomial A" _,\2 +,\ ­1 = (,\ ­1)(,\2 + 1).
Therefore, ad(A) does not have all real eigenvalues, so that G is not completely
solvable and, so, is not amenable to Hattori's theorem.
4. The Benson-Gordon Conjecture
In this section we shall prove the Benson­Gordon conjecture in dimension 4.
The proof of this result is based on Theorem 3.8 and, in fact, on the Kodaira
and Yau classification of compact complex surfaces [BPY]. It explains all known
examples of symplectic non­Kahler four­dimensional solvmanifolds [FG2].

THE BENSON-GORDON CONJECTURE
97
'I'heor-em 4.1. Any 4-dimensional compact solvmanifold carrying a Kahler struc-
ture is diffeomorphic to a torus.
To prove this result, we need a description of all 4-dimensional Lie groups admit-
ting lattices given by Theorem 1.9. Recall that each solvable four dimensional
simply-connected Lie group admitting a lattice has one of the following forms:
(1) G = JR Xl 1> Na, where ¢ : JR ----+ Aut(Na) is a one-parameter subgroup such
that ¢(1)(Na(IQ)) C Na(IQ);
(2) G = JR ><11> JRa, where ¢ : JR ----+ GLa(JR) is a one-parameter subgroup such
that ¢(1) E GLa(.:Z).
Proof of Theorem 4.1. We carry out the proof of Theorem 4.1 by carefully ex-
amining all the possibilities for (A¢t)*(1) E
8)) and analyzing the
Felix-Thomas models of the appropriate Mostow bundles. According to Theorem
1.4.6, the K.S. model for A(Gjf) is given by
(A(x), 0) ----+ (A, D) = (A(x) wAY, D) ----+ (AY, dy)
(9)
with deg(x) = 1 and H*(AY) = U, where U is a maximal unipotent sub module
in
8), or A(JRa)* respectively. We claim that the following implication
holds:
if
zEZl(A(x)®AY,D)
===? z=O:"x+!3y,o-,.BEJR,yEY,
and
dyy=O.
Indeed, z = O:"x +!3y, since it is the only possibility of getting a cochain of degree
1, while the second equality is proved by the following argument. First, Dz =
o ===? Dy = o. Secondly, because the arrows in (9) are DGA-morphisms, Dy =
dyy+(x), where (x) denotes an expression belonging to the ideal generated by x.
Since A is a free algebra, these two expressions must vanish simultaneously, and,
hence, dyy = O. Moreover, since there are no coboundaries of degree 1 in (A, D)
and (AY, dy ), any z E Zl(A), whzch is not proportional to x, generates a non-
zero cohomology class In Hl(AY, dy). This means that the following inequality
holds:
bl(A)
bl(AY) + 1.
(10)
Having this in mind, let JA be the Jordan form of the matrix A
¢(1)*e E
Aut(na) where ¢(1k is the derivative mapping of ¢(1) at the identity e. The
following two possibilities may occur:
(1) All eigenvalues 0:"1,0:"2, O:"a are real and therefore
* :);
0:"a
(2) Two eigenvalues of A are complex with non-zero imaginary parts and
therefore

SOLVMANIFOLDS
o
,\
o
Note that, since A has real entries, its non-real eigenvalues must be conjugate.
Since G admits a lattice, it is a unimodular Lie group (see [Rag, Chapter I,
Remark 1.9]). Recall that a Lie group G is unimodular if and only if IdetAd(g)1 =
1 for any 9 E G [He, p. 366]. In particular, in the two cases respectively,
(11)
We begin with the case G =
IP? >cl¢ N 3 . Let us first analyze subcase 1). Again,
two possibilities may occur: either none of the eigenvalues O:i equals 1, or only
one eigenvalue is 1. Since there are no coboundaries in (An;, 6)1,
and
(A¢t)*(1)IHl(N3 ) = (¢t)*(1)IHl(An;,b)cn;.
The latter equality together with the condition
O:i
:j:. 1 for i =
1,2,3 show
that un H 1(An;, 6) = {O}, where U is the maximal unipotent submodule of
H*(An;, 6).
Since the latter space is trivial, b1(AY) = 0 and, from (10), the first Betti
number of G/f must be 1 (corresponding to the cohomology class [x]). By the
Hard Lefschetz Theorem, Kahler manifolds have even odd-degree Betti numbers.
Thus, in the case of all O:i :j:. 1, GIf cannot carry a J(dhler structure.
Consider now the case O:i = 1 for some i. Choose a basis in n3, e1, e2, e3 such
that [el, e2] = e3. Since ¢*e(1) E Aut(n3)' the center Z(n3) = IP?e3 and therefore
¢*e(1)e3 = 0:3 e3·
If 0:1 :j:.
0:2, ¢*e(1) is a semisimple automorphism and there exists a comple-
ment V of IP?e3 in n3 invariant under the action of ¢*e' Thus, there exist linear
independent vectors VI, V2 E V such that
/10:3 = P0:10:2·
Comparing this with (11), we get (0:10:2)2 = 1. If 0:3 = 1 and 0:1 :j:. 0:2, we can
give the following argument. For the dual basis
e; of n*, the cohomology
of An" is generated by

THE BENSON-GORDON CONJECTURE
99
and, again, Un H 1(An*, b) = {O}. The same argument as in the previous case
shows that b1(GIf) = 1 and, hence, the solvmanifold cannot carry a Kahler
structure. Let
(X3 = -1. We have assumed already that (Xi =
1 for some i. In
both cases, (11) implies (Xl = 1, (X2 = -1, (X3 = -1, or (Xl
= -1, (X2 = 1, (X3 = -1.
Thus, the following possibilities for JA remain:
Note that in each case of JA above, H 1(An;;,b) n U = (y), where, without loss
of generality, y is either vi, or v;. Thus, dim(U n H 1(AY)) = 1 and (10) implies
b1(GIf) ::; 2. Finally, the case (X3 = -1 is settled by quoting the following two
results: first, by [FG2, Theorem 3, p.
298],
a [our-dimension al pamllelizable
compact manifold with b1 = 2 carries no complex structure. Secondly, any on-
eniable four-dimensional compact solvmanifold is pcrallelizable (Theorem 1.11).
Thus, if (X3 = -1, a Kahler structure is impossible and the Benson-Gordon con-
jecture is proved in subcase 1).
Consider now subcase 2).
Again, since
!R'.e3 is preserved by 1>*.(1), we can
choose the matrix of 1>*, to have the form
(
It
J = -;
v
IIa
where
II, u,
(X E !R'..
Indeed, one can check that this matrix has the same invariant polynomials as
the Jordan matrix JA, namely
where JA(.\) is a characteristic polynomial of JA (or J). Since these polynomials
have real coefficients, they constitute also the system of invariant polynomials of
J over
!R'. and the same is valid for each matrix with real entries which has the
Jordan form JA. Therefore, each matrix with the Jordan form JA is conjugate
with J over
!R'. by a standard conjugacy criterion. Now, if (X oF 1, 1>*e(1) has no
eigenvalues equal to 1 and the same argument as in subcase 1) yields b1(GIf) = 1
and the proof follows.
If (X = 1, we get
11 2 + v 2 = 1.
However, in this case
n;; =
o" EB !R'.e3, where e;; is a vector dual to e3 (which is in the center of n3, and,
therefore, does not generate non-zero cohomology classes).
Again, H 1(AY) =
H 1(An;;,b) = (vi,v2) and [jl = UnH 1(AY ) = {O}, which implies b1(G/f) = 1.
Consider now the case G =!R'. :xl¢!R'.3. This case is easier, since R" is an abelian
Lie algebra and one can use the Jordan matrix directly that is, without loss of
generality, the matrix representing A = 1>(1)*, can be represented as follows:
either
(

A =

or

SOLVMANIFOLDS
In each case, H*(AY, dy ) = A(Xl, X2, X3), where all Xi constitute a base in which
A has one of the two forms above.
In the first case above we get dim(U n
H1(AY)) :s 2, in the second case, respectively, dim(U n H1(AY)) :s 1. This
means that either b1(G/r) :s 3, or b1(G/f) :s 2 (from (10)). The cases b1 = 1
and h = 3 are eliminated by the Hard Lefschetz Theorem, the case b1 = 2 by
Theorem 3 in [FG2, p.298].
D
Remark 4.2. [FG2, Theorem 3, p. 298] is, in fact, a corollary to the Kodaira and
Yau classification of compact complex surfaces [BPVJ, [Y].
5. Higher dimensional examples and
twisted tensor products
We have already mentioned that, fortunately enough, the 4-dimensional case
could be settled by the use of an additional information specific to complex
compact surfaces [BPV]. There is no such information in higher dimensions.
Therefore, the aim of this section is twofold.
First, we try to collect as much
information as we can coming from rational homotopy theory.
With this pur-
pose, we analyse the algebraic properties of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes
associated with solvmanifolds (completely solvable or not, Theorem 5.1). These
results enable us to construct several higher dimensional examples.
Secondly,
we try to develop an alternative approach along the lines of Sullivan's origi-
nal twisted models.
Unfortunately, we don't know whether the total spaces of
Mostow bundles admit twisted tensor products as rational models.
Theorem 5.1. Let M = G/f be a compact solvmanifold carrying a Kii.hlerian
structure.
Then the cochain complex (Ag*, 6) of the Lie algebra 9 satisfies the
property the: all triple Massey products and higher order Massey products of
the pair (Ag* , H* (Ag*) vanish as cohomology classes in H* (Ag*). That is, there
is a choice of cocheins in Ag* representing all triple Massey products and higher
order Massey products so that these cochains are exact.
Remark 5.2. This condition is stronger then saying simply that all Massey prod-
ucts vanish, since for instance, a triple Massey product ([aJ, [bJ, [c]) is defined
with an indeterminancy lying in the ideal generated by [a] and [c].
Recall that for introducing Massey products one needs a pair (A, H*(A)) (a
differential graded algebra A together with its cohomology algebra). It is impor-
tant for us to stress this fact, since in the sequel we will change algebras without
changzng cohomologies and, therefore, Massey products will also vary for differ-
ent pairs. For this reason, we will use a slightly different terminology considering
Massey products of the pair (A, H*(A)).
Proof of Theorem 5.1. Theorem 2.9 implies that the natural map (Ag*, 6)
---+
(ODR(G/f), d) induces a monomorphism on the cohomology level and the proof
of the theorem then follows from Lemma 5.3 below.
D
Lemma 5.3. Let

HIGHER DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES
101
(6)
be a morphism in !Pl.-DCA, inducing monomorphism in cohomology. Then the
foJJowingimplication holds: if (B, dB) is a formal consequence of its cohomology
algebra, then aJJ triple Massey products and higher order Massey products of
the pair (A, H*(A)) vanish as cohomology classes in H*(A). That is, there is a
choice of cochains in A representing aJJ triple Massey products and higher order
Massey products so that these cochains are exact.
Proof. Consider, first, triple Massey products. Of course, we could proceed with
Massey products of an arbitrary order, but we prefer to accomplish the proof sep-
arately for triple and then for quadruple Massey products presenting all essential
moments of the proof but avoiding clumsy notation.
Note that for each morphism 'P : (A, dA ) ­­­+ (B, de).
'P* ([a), [b), [c]) = ('P*[a), 'P*[b), 'P*[c]),
where the right­hand side of this identity is considered as a cohomology class
in H*(B, dB) and the right­hand product (,,) is taken with respect to the pair
(B, H*(B)).
Indeed, the cohomology class [y] representing the triple Massey
product is determined by the following procedure. If
then
Here and in the sequel x denotes (-I)P x for x E AP. We take an arbitrary cocycle
y obtained by this procedure and fix it, We don't care about the indeterminancy
lying in ([a), [cD. Then
and
'P(dAx
12 ) = dB'P(x 12 ) = 'P(a)'P(b)
'P(dAx23 ) = dB'P(x 23 ) = 'P(b)'P(c),
so that 'P(Y) represents, by definition, a triple Massey product
(['P(a)), ['P(b)), ['P(c)])
of the pair (B, H*(B)). Finally,
'P*[Y] = (['P*[a), 'P*[b), 'P*[c])

as expected.
Now, let us prove the lemma for triple Massey products. Let (MB, d) be the
minimal model of (B, dB) and p be the corresponding quasi-isomorphism
Assume that there exists a non-zero cohomology class [y] E H*(A, dA ) repre-
sented as a triple Massey product [y] = ([a]' [b], [cD.
We have already shown
that 1/'*[y] = (1/'*[a], 1/'*[b], 1/'* [c]). Since 1/'* is injective, 1/'*[y] represents a non-
zero cohomology class in H*(B) which is represented as a triple Massey prod-
uct of the pair (B, H*(B)).
Since p" is an isomorphism, there exist cocycles
as«, bi«, CM E MB such that
Recall that
1/;* [a] 1/'* [b] = 0,
1/'* [b]1/'*[c] = 0,
Hence,
dZ12 = aMbM,
dz 23 = bMcM
for cochains z12, z23 E MB. Take
which is a cocycle representing the triple Massey product ([aM], [bM], [CM]) of
the pair (M B, H*(MB) ::= H*(B)). Thus,
P*[YM] = p*([aM], [bM], [CM])
= (p* [aM], p*[bM], P*[CM])
= (1/'*[a], 1/)*[b], 1/'* [c])
=1/'*[y]fO.
But, since (MB, d) is formal, [YM] must vanish as a cohomology class in H*(MB)
because of the following general fact proved in [DGMS, p.262](also see Remark
1.3.2):
if (MB, d) is formal, then uniform choices can be made so that the
cochains representing all Massey products and higher order Massey products are
exact. This contradiction implies ([a]' [b], [c]) = 0 in H*(A).
Consider now quadruple Massey products. Recall the procedure of construct-
ing the corresponding cohomology classes. Again, we assume that all cohomology
classes representzng triple Massey products of the pair (A, H*(A)) vanish. This

HIGHER DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLES
103
is the condition under which quadruple Massey products are well-defined. Some-
times this condition is called 'simultaneous vanishing'. Assume that [w] E H*(A)
is a quadruple Massey product,
[w] = ([a], [b], [c], [u]).
Again, we begin with the general observation that
<p* [w] = (<p*[a], <p*[b], <p*[e], <p*[u])
for each Im.-DGA-morphism <po Indeed, the construction of the quadruple Massey
product is carried out as follows. We take cochains x 12 , X 23, x 34 E A such that
dAx
12 = lib, dAx
23 = be, dAx
34 = eu
and cochains x 13, X 24 E A such that
dAx
13 = liX23 + x12e, dAx
24 = bx34 + x23u
and form a cocycle
Again, as in the previous case,
<pdAx
12 = dB<P(x
12 ) = <p(a)<p(b),
<pdAx
23 = dB<P(x
23 ) = <p(b)<p(e),
<pdAx
34 = dB<P(X34 ) = <p(c)<p(u),
<pdAx
13 = dB<P(X 13 ) = <p(a)<p(x 23 ) + <p(x 12)<p(e),
<pdAx
24 = dB<P(x
24 ) = <p(b)<p(x34 ) + <p(x 23)<p(u),
which means that
represents the corresponding quadruple Massey product of the pair (B, H* (B).
Finally,
<p*[w] = ([<p*[a], <p*[b], <p*[e], <p*[u]).
Again, take the minimal model (MB, d) and cocycles [aM], [bM], [eM] and rUM] in
MB such that p*[aM] = ¢*[a], p*[bM] = ¢*[b], P*[cM] = ¢*[e], P*[UM] = ¢*[u].
Since p* is an isomorphism, the identities involving cohomology classes in II* (A)
are transferred to H*(MB):

104
SOLVMANIFOLDS
For example, [a][b] =°
lV [ah')* [b] = p*[aM]p*[bM] = 0). Hence
Since ([a], [b], [c]) =°and ([b], [c], [u]) =°as cohomology classes in H*(A), the
same is valid for their images under 1jJ* and p" (see the corresponding identity
for arbitrary <p*). Therefore,
as cohomology classes in H*(M B) and there exist cochains z13, z24 E MB such
that
Hence, the quadruple Massey product is well defined with respect to the pair
(MB, H*(MB)):
and
p* ([aM], [bM], [CM], [UM]) = (p* [aM], p* [bM], P*[CM], p* rUM])
=(1jJ* [a], 1jJ*[b], 1jJ*[c]' 1jJ*[u])
= 1// ([a], [b], [c], [u]) :j: 0,
if we assume that ([a], [b], [c], [u]) :j: 0, since 1jJ* is an injection. However, (MB, d)
is formal and ([aM], [bM], [CM], rUM]) must vanish as a cohomology class (again,
appeal to the remark on p. 262 in [DGMS]). This contradiction completes the
proof. The same argument is obviously valid for Massey products of arbitrary
orders.

Example 5.4. We will construct an 8-dimensional example of a compact sym-
plectic solvmanifold G/f such that G is not completely solvable. This example

From (13), g is solvable but non-nilpotent. The bracket [A, Xl] = Xl contradicts
the nilpotency condition, while solvability follows from the inclusion [g, g] C n
and the commutativity of n.
Now, computing the exponential mapping from the standard formula
'P(exptA) = e'P·CtA), 'P(exptB) = e'P·CtB)
we obtain the expression of 'P(t, x).

Remark 5.7. We have proven also that G is solvable, non-nilpotent and not com-
pletely solvable since ad A possesses an imaginary eigenvalue (see the expression
for adA = 'P*(A)).

The annihilation of 6 on the first two terms follows from the fact that all 6xj
contain either a, or b while the annihilation of 6 on the sum of the other terms

and thus Ag* is symplectic.
This algebra has non-vanishing quadruple Massey products. To simplify nota-
tion, we denote the Chevalley­Eilenberg complex (Ag*, 6) by the symbol (A, 6).
If all the triple Massey products in (A, 6) vanish, we can form a quadruple Massey
product as follows. Let [..\1] E HP(A), [..\2] E Hq(A), [..\3] E Hr(A), [..\4] E HS(A)

Conclusion to Proof of Theorem 5.5. Lemma .5.6 implies (i) of Theorem .5 ..5 and
(ii) follows from Lemma .5.8 and remark .5.7. To prove (iii), we shall use again
the isomorphism between the graded differential algebra (Ag*, 8) and the algebra
of left-invariant differential forms on G. The inequality w 4 ::f- 0 in case of left-
Invariant differential forms implies the non-degeneracy of the appropriate matrix
of the 2-form w. Since G
GIf is a covering, the matrix of the differential form
induced by w on GIf remains the same and, therefore, is non-degenerate. Thus,
w determines a symplectic structure on GIf.
Since Lemma .5.9 implies that
(Ag*,8) has non-vanishing quadruple Massey products as cohomology classes

Now, we turn to the final part of this chapter which deals with twisted tensor
products. Our approach is not the most general one (cf. [HD)). The ideas behind
this exposition come, partially, from the work of Schlessinger and Stasheff [SchS].
Let (A, dA ) and (B, dB) be graded commutative differential algebras.
Let
A 129 B denote the tensor product of A and B as graded algebras.
Introduce a
'twisted' derivation d by the formula

Here 1Jf is a derivation of (B, dB) decreasing degrees by i. That is
1Jf(xy) = 1Jf(x)y + (_l)ide g(x)x1Jf(Y)
and {af+l'
= 1,2, ... } constitute a basis of A i+1
Definition 5.10. A graded differential algebra (A 0 B, d) equipped with a dif-
ferential d determined by (28) is called a twisted tensor product.
Note that the Koszul-Sullivan extensions defined in Chapter 2 are twisted
tensor products of a particular type. Therefore, theorems which we prove in the
sequel are applicable at least to nilpotent fibrations.
The weaker assumptions
in Definition 5.10 encourage us to look for more general non-nilpotent fibrations
whose models admit a structure of a twisted tensor product.
Theorem 5.11. Let

over a homotopy torus t» . Assume that the total space E of the bundle admits
a model (A(E), d) which can be represented as a twisted tensor product
(A(E), d) = (AX, 0) ®T (AY, 6)
where X and Yare finite dimensional vector spaces of elements of degree land
(AY,6) is a minimal differential algebra. Then, if E admits a Kahler structure,
the model (A( E), d) has the foJJowing properties:
(i) (A(E), d) is a Lefschetz algebra;

for ihe bigrading Aij = Aix (Xl Ajy the foJJowing equalities hold:

Proof. From Poincare duality
dimHn-1(AX ® AY) = k.
From (30)
115
zn-l(AX ® AY) = Ak-U + Ak,l-l
and, by comparing degrees (using the fact that (AY,8) is minimal which guar-
antees that the YtjsJ do not contain expressions with Yj), we have
d(Ak-1,I-l) C Ak,l-l,
d(A k,I- 2) C Ak,l-l.
From Lemma 5.13 (Formula (31))
and therefore, the subspace of coboundaries B n - 1 C Ak,l-l. Thus,
dimHn-1(AX ® AY) = dim(Ak-1,1 + Ak,l-l) - dimBn- 1 = k.
Therefore, since dimAk,l-l = I and dimAk-1,1 = k, the assumption B n - 1 i-
Ak,l-l would imply
dim Hn- 1 = dim z-:: - dim Bn- 1 = k + 1- dim Bn- 1 > k.
Thus

Since there exists a model (A*(E),d) which admits a structure of a twisted
tensor product, it remains to prove that this algebra possesses algebraic prop-
erties (i) - (iv) stated in Theorem 5.11.
The first property follows from the
existence of a Kahlerian structure on E.
Suppose that (AX 0 AY, d) satisfies the conditions of Lemma 5.14 and dYj
are linearly independent. Then (32) holds, since dl x = 0 and dl y is one-to-one.
If some dYj are linearly dependent, by the obvious base change one can assume
that for the new basic vectors iii, diii = 0 and thus iii EX. Therefore one can
assume the linear independence of dYj without loss of generality and (33) follows.
Now, condition (ii) follows from Lemma .5.14.
To prove (iii)-(iv), take y* E Y* and observe that
(i(y*)w)wm- 1 =
E Ak,l-l,
m.
since wm E An = Ak+l . From (34) i(y* )wm is a coboundary. Therefore,

because otherwise the hard Lefschetz condition and Lemma .5.14 would give a
contradiction. Thus there exists f/ E Y* such that w(y* , fl*) of 0 and therefore
wly. xv- is non-degenerate. Observe that using non-degeneracy, one can choose
X' to be w-orthogonal to Y*.
Using the appropriate identifications of exterior
algebra elements and alternating forms,
we obtain the form of the Lefschetz
element; that is, (iii) and, as a consequence, (iv). Theorem 5.11 is proved.

Example 5.15: Benson-Gordon Theorem. Using the Chevalley-Eilenberg
complex (Ag*, 8) in the completely solvable case, Benson and Gordon proved
in [BG2] a theorem which describes the algebraic structure of Lie algebras 9
such that Gjf admits Kahler structures. We give here a proof of this theorem
(Theorem 5.16) which is a corollary to Theorem 5.11.
Theorem 5.16. IfG is completely solvable and Gjf admits a Kahler structure,
then
(i) there is an abelian complement 0 in 9 of the derived algebra n = [9, g];
(ii)
a and n are even dimensional;
(iii)
the center of 9 intersects n trivially;
(iv)
the Kahler form is cohomologeous to a left-invariant symplectic form
w = Wo +Wj, where n = Ker(wo) and n = Ker(wJ);
(v)
both Wo and Wj are closed but non exact in 9 and also in 0 and n;
(vi)
the adjoint action of a on n is by infinitesimal symplectomorphisms.
By analyzing the proof of Theorem .5.11 we see that conditions (ii)-(iv) are
valid for any twisted tensor product of the form given in Theorem 5.11 and
satisfying the Lefschetz condition.
We assign to Gjf a model (Ag*, 8) which
possesses properties (i)-(iv) of A(Gjf) although this new model in general differs
from the latter. Take =[g, g] and decompose g* as a vector space sum
g* = 0* ffi n* ,
where
n" = {e E g*1 e(n) = A},
n" = {o: E g*1 0:(0) = O}.
Here 0 is an arbitrary complement to n. Now, taking into account the equalities
8(3(U, V) = -f3([X, Y]),
n = [g, g]
we have
8(Ao*)=O.
Since n C in the nilradical of n, the ideal n is nilpotent and therefore
is a minimal graded differential algebra. Therefore,

so that the model for Gjf can be represented as a twisted tensor product satisfy-
ing the condition (ii) of theorem .5.11, the Lefschetz condition and the conditions
of Lemmas 5.12­5.14 (the latter is guaranteed by the minimality of the second
term in the twisted tensor product). Finally, (A(Gjr), d) satisfies the properties
(i)­(iv) of Theorem 5.11 and as a consequence, the properties (ii), (iv) and (v)
of Theorem 5.16
Remark 5.17. These properties were proved in [BG2] directly for the particular
case of (Ag", 6) with completely solvable G.
The theorem of Benson­Gordon is very important. Probably, it yields the best
possible result in the framework of the Chevalley­Eilenberg complexes associated
to solvmanifolds, as the higher dimensional examples below suggest.

H2(g) = ([WD], [WI])

H 4(g) = ([WD /\ WI], [WI /\ WI])
H 5(g) = ([a /\ wi], [b /\ wd)
H 6 (g) = ([wrJ, [WD /\ wi])
H 7(g) = ([u], [v]),
where
u = a /\ Xl /\ X2 /\ X3 /\ Zl /\ Z2 /\ Z3,
V = b /\ Xl /\ X2 /\ X3 /\ Zl /\ Z2 /\ Z3
H 8 (g) = ([a /\ b /\ Xl /\ X2 /\ X3/\ Zl /\ Z2 /\ Z3]).
The Lefschetz maps L[w3]: Hl(g) -+ H 7(g), L[w]> : H 2(g) -+ H 6(g) and
L[w] : H 3 (g) -+ H 5(g) are all isomorphisms. The minimal model of the
Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Ag*, 8) is given by the formula
(M,d) = (A(a,;3",z),d)
do = d;3 = dz = 0,
d, = z4
where
lal = 1;31 = 1,
1,1 = 7,
Izi = 2.
Indeed, we can check that the DGA-map
rp(a) = a,

rp(z) = WI,
rp(,) = 0
is a quasi-isomorphism. This algebra is isomorphic to the minimal model

Thus, we have obtained two contrasting examples regarding algebraic prop-
erties of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes associated to completely solvable
solvmanifolds. Note, however, that these examples are completely algebraic and
do not yield definite geometric results since we don't even know whether the cor-
responding Lie groups contain lattices. Obviously, in both cases 9 is unimodular,
so the necessary condition for the existence of a lattice is satisfied. It would be
interesting to relate these examples to geometry.

CHAPTER 4
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
While this book is mostly concerned with non-simply-connected examples of
non-Kahler symplectic manifolds, it must be admitted that the simply connected
situation is much harder.
In particular, for nilmanifolds, the Lefschetz type
criterion (see Theorem 2.2.4) was enough to constrain a nilmanifold to be a
torus. Moreover, the Lefschetz type criterion is a condition on H 1(M; ((Jl), so it
has no place in the simply connected world. For a more general discussion of the
way a symplectic form can depend on the fundamental group, see [L02]. The first
examples of simply connected non- Kahler symplectic manifolds were constructed
by Dusa McDuff in [McDI] using a symplectic version of the classical blow-up
procedure in algebraic geometry.
In this chapter, we will describe McDuff's
examples in some detail and point out some possible questions for future study.
1. Classical Blow-UpS
In order to better appreciate the symplectic blow-up, let's briefly recall how
blow-ups arise in algebraic geometry. The details of most of what follows may
be found, for example, in [GrR]. Recall that the universal (or canonical) bundle
In over cpn is given by
In = {(z,/) E Cn+1 X cpn I z E l}.
If I = [11, ... ,In+d in homogeneous coordinates, then the condition z E I trans-
lates into Z; = Ali for all i. Another way to express this is to say that, for all i, j,
z; lj = Zj Ii· Consider the unit disk bundle of In denoted by D( In) and consisting
of all (z,/) E In with Izi < 1. Let 71': D(rn) -+ D(O, 1) denote the projection of
the disk bundle onto the open disk of radius I in Cn+1 given by 71'(z, I)) = z.
Although 71' is not a bundle map, we can still ask what its fibers are.
Because
IE cpn may be thought of as a line in Cn+1 through the origin, it is determined
by any point on it. In other words, if z f::- 0, then the inverse image 71'-1 (z) = (z, I)
consists of a single point. On the other hand, 71'- 1(0) = {( 0, I) Ii E cpn} = cpn.
Thus, D(rn) looks exactly like D(O, 1) away from °and replaces °by complex
projective n-space. That is, the origin has been blown up to make all the lines l
disjoint. Furthermore, note that, since D( In) -+ cpn is a disk bundle, then the
long exact homotopy sequence says that D( In) is simply connected.
If X is a complex (n + I)-manifold and x E X is a point with complex coor-
dinate chart TJ: U -+ D( 0, I), then we may define an isomorphism
-1
1r: D(ln) - 71'-1(0) -: D(O, 1) - {a}
U - {x}
which then may be used as an attaching map in

CLASSICAL BLOW-UPS
BI(X,x) = (X - {x})U" D(l'n).
121
BI(X, X) is a complex manifold called the blow-up of X
at x and the inverse
image -n--1(x) is known as the exceptional divisor £ of the blow-up.
One use
of the blow-up in algebraic geometry is in the proof of the Kodaira embedding
theorem.
There is a simple relationship between the homology groups of the
blow-up and those of X, but since the same relation exists for the symplectic
blow-up, we will postpone a discussion of this until later.
To extend the discussion above to subrnanifolds, first consider the case of
a submanifold V of a disk D = D(O, 1) C Cn defined by setting coordinates
Zk+l = Zk+2 = ... = Zn = O. Let D C D x cpn-k-l be the variety defined by
D = {(z,l) E D x cpn-k-l I zilj = Zjli for k+ 1 S i,j S n}.
Again, the projection 7r: D ---> D is an isomorphism away from V and the inverse
image of any point in V is cpn-k-l. If X is a complex manifold of dimension
nand M C X is a k-dimensional complex submanifold, then take a collection of
charts {Uo} covering M having coordinates such that M is given in each chart
by Zk+l = Zk+2 = ... = Zn = O. By identifying Uo with D a , we may form the
blow-up U0 = Do for each ex. Moreover, the projections 7r0: U0
---> U0 have the
property that
are isomorphisms. Then we may define
with projection 7r: U ---> UoU a . Note that, since
7r is an isomorphism away from
M n UaUo, we may form the blow-up X of X along M by
together with a projection 7r: X ---> X extending 7r: U ---> UoUo and the identity
on X - M satisfying the properties:
(1)
7r is an isomorphism away from 7r- 1(M ) (i.e. the exceptional divisor E);
(2) The exceptional divisor £ is the total space of a bundle over M with
fiber cpn-k-l and this bundle may be identified with the projectivized
normal bundle of M in X.
All we have said is virtually a verbatim transcription of the description of the
blow-up in [GrH p.
603]. The reader is referred there for more details as well
as beautiful applications of this construction in algebraic geometry.
With the
classical blow-up as our model, we can now focus on the symplectic blow-up due
to Gromov and used so effectively by McDuff in [McDl].

122
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
2. The Symplectic Blow-Up
Suppose M 2(n - k ) C X 2n is a codimension 2k (k > 1) submanifold whose
normal bundle has structure group U(k).
Note that, if (M,G") C (X,w) is a
symplectic submanifold, then this hypothesis always holds. The reason for this
is that the normal bundle // C T X is the w-orthogonal complement to T MeTX
and w thus restricts to give a skew-symmetric bilinear (i.e. symplectic) form on
u . Since U(k) == Sp(2k,lP?), this gives the required reduction of the structure
group to U(k).
Denote the normal bundle of M in X by u : E
M and let
p
U(k)
P -> M
be the associated principal bundle.
Note that the hypothesis implies that we
may take the fiber of the normal bundle to be CCk. Let 'Yk : L
CCpk-1 denote
the universal (or canonical) line bundle over CCpk -1. As above,
L = {(z,/) E Ck x Cpk-1 I z E I}
with bundle map the projection onto the second coordinate. Now, U(k) acts on
Ck and CCpk- 1 (the latter by A· [Z1, ... ,Zk] = [A(Z1,'"
,Zk)]), so it acts by
bundle automorphisms on 'Yk;
A . (z, 1) = (Az, AI).
Therefore, we may form the bundles
L
jj; = P XU(k) L
M
and
CCpk-1
Nt = P XU(k) Cpk- 1
M
and also obtain a line bundle E
Nt.
There is something special to note about the construction of Nt above from
principal bundle data.
Namely, Nt is precisely the projectivized bundle of the
normal bundle of M in X. In other words, we have taken the principal bundle
structure associated to the normal bundle and used it to replace the normal
bundle fiber CCk with the corresponding projective space CCpk- 1. Much is known
about projectivized bundles. In particular, the Leray-Hirsch theorem says that,
for any complex k-bundle E
M and projectivization P(E), the cohomology
of P(E) is given by
H*(P(E)) = H*(M)[x]/(x k + C1xk-1 + ...+ Ck-1X+ Ck)
where the c/s are the Chern classes of the original bundle E
M and x is a
degree 2 class generating the cohomology of the complex projective space fiber.
For a nice discussion of this, see [BTu]. The above description implies that, as
vector spaces (or even as H*(M) modules), there is an isomorphism
H*(P(E)) =v.s H*(M) ® H*(CCpk- 1).

THE SYMPLECTIC BLOW-UP
123
These observations may be applied to tV! so that H*(tV!) == H*(M)0H*(Cpk-1).
Also, note that we have replaced various algebraic geometrical constructs by
topological ones involving the principal bundle P.
Furthermore, just as the
exceptional divisor sits inside the classical blow-up, so too does tV! sit inside E
as the zero section of the line bundle E -4 tV!.
If we let Eo = E-zero section of (E -4 tV!) and Eo = E-zero section of (E-
M), then there is a commutative diagram
Eo
Eo
E
E
tV!
lp
----+
M.
Now, E = P XU(k) L -4 P XU(k) Cp k - 1 = tV! is given by
[P, (z, I)] f-+ [P, I]
where the square brackets denote equivalence classes under the U(k) action.
Therefore, the zero section of the line bundle E -4 tV! is given by
[p, I] r-> [P, (0, I)]
and, similarly, the zero section of E = P XU(k) ([k -4 M (with [p,z] r-> 7T([P, z]))
takes m = 7T([P, z]) to [p, 0]. The map o : E -4 E is induced by the projection L -4
Ck , (z, I) f---+ z.
Hence, 1>( [p, (z, I)]) = [p, z]. Clearly, 1> lEo is a diffeomorphism.
This follows because any z i- 0 lies on a unique complex line I through the
origin.
Thus, in this case, there is an inverse to [P, (z, I)]
f-+ [P, z] given by
[P, z] f-+ [P, (z, I)] where I is the unique complex line through z and o.
Definition 2.1. The manifold E is called the blow-up of E along M.
Now consider the composition of fibrations
-
-
k-1
P
E = P XU(k) L -4 M = P XU(k) ([P
--4 M.
Since L -4 Cp k - 1 is a surjection (being a bundle map), we see that the com-
posite fibration E -4 M has fiber L (because Cp k - 1 is the fiber of p). Recall
that the tubular neighborhood theorem states that the normal bundle of an em-
bedding always contains a sub-disk bundle which is diffeomorphic to a tubular
neighborhood of the submanifold in the ambient manifold. If we apply this to
the normal bundle E -4 M, then we obtain a disk bundle VeE diffeomorphic
to a (closed) tubular neighborhood W of M in X.
Set V = q.,-l(V) and note
that, as we have argued previously, V is diffeomorphic to V off the zero section
(which corresponds to the embedding of M in W). In particular, aV == aV.

124
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
Definition 2.2. The blow-up X of X along M is the smooth manifold
X = X - W Uav V
where oV is identified with oW as in the tubular neighborhood theorem. The
blow-up projection is the obvious map 1;: X -+ X.
Note that V and oV fiber over M.
This follows because we can take V =
P XU(k) D where P is the principal bundle above and D = D2k C Ck is the unit
disk. Then, as is clear from the construction and a comparison with the classical
disk blow-up, we have
V = P XU(k) iJ
and
-
-2k-l
oV =oV = P XU(k),)
where iJ is the blow-up of D. Then, V ----> M has [P, d] f-+ p(p) where p: P -+ M
is the principal bundle projection.
The algebraic topology of the blow-up may be understood in terms of the
cohomologies of the spaces involved in its construction. In particular, we have
the following fundamental result.
'I'heorem 2.3 [McDl]. With the notation above:
(1)
There is a class a E H 2(E) such that the pullback of a to L via L -+ E
is the generator of H*(L) == lru. [yJj(yk).
(2) H*(E) == H*(M)[aJj(ak + clak- 1 + ... + Ck)'
(3)
1Tl (X) == 1Tl(X),
(4)
There is a short exact sequence
0-+ H*(X)
----> H*(X) -+ A* ----> 0
where the quotient A* is given by
A* = coker(H*(M) ----> H*(E))
=H*(M)[aJj(ak + clak- 1 + ... + Ck)'
Here H*(M)[aJl(ak + clak- 1 + ... + Ck) denotes the 'reduced' part of
H*(M) excluding H*(M).
That is, A* is a free module over H*(M)
generated by {a, a2, ... ,ak- 1 } .
Proof For (1), note that we have the commutative diagram
L
1
1
E
---->
M.

THE SYMPLECTIC BLOW-UP
125
Now, M is the projectivization of the normal bundle of M
III X, so, as we
mentioned above, this means that H*(M) == H*(M)[x]/(x k ) and that x
f-+ y
where H*(Cpk-l)
=: lPI.[y]/(yk).
(We also write the cohomology of L in this
form since L
::::: Cpk-I.)
Following x around both ways of the cohomology
diagram induced by the diagram above, we let a be the image of x in H*(E) and
we note that a then maps to the generator y of H* (L).
For (2), observe that the fibration L
---+ E ---+ M
(with the specific class
a) satisfies the hypotheses of the Leray-Hirsch theorem [BTu].
Therefore, the
conclusion follows.
For (3), we first use Van Kampen's theorem to write
"lr1(X) == "lr1(X - W) *1Tl ( &V ) "lr1(V)
since the blow-up is defined as an adjunction space
BY
---+
V
1
X-W
---+
X.
Because W (as a tubular neighborhood) deformation retracts onto M, we see
that "lr1(X - W) == "lr1(X - M). But M has codimension greater than or equal
to 4, so (taking a smooth representaive of every class in the fundamental group)
transversality ensures that each loop and each homotopy may be made disjoint
from M. Hence, 1TI(X - M) == 1TI(X) and so
"lr1(X - W) == 1TI(X)
As we have said above, Y and BY fiber over M as
S2k-1
D

BY

M.
Since S2k-1 and jj are simply connected, we see that there are isomorphisms
"lr1(BY) == 1TI(M) == "lr1(Y). This isomorphism between the fundamental groups
of BY and Y says that, in the amalgamated product
the second factor is absorbed into the first.
Hence,
1TI(X) "'" "lr1 (X - W) "'"
1TI(X).
For (4), we begin by writing

Recall that. if Z is a oriented m-manifold with boundary OZ, then there is a
natural isomorphism
appearing as the boundary homomorphism in the homology exact sequence of
the pair (Z oZ), This isomorphism implies that the inclusion oZ L-, Z induces
the zero map Hm-1(oZ)
Hm-1(Z). Thus, in the Mayer-Vietoris ladder above,
for i = 2n (i.e. the'real dimension of X and X), we have
o
l=
O.
Therefore, the blow-up projection ¢*: H 2n (X )
H 2n(X) is an isomorphism
(preserving orientation).
Of course, this is also true for cohomology and this
has the effect that the induced map on cohomology ¢;*: H* (X)
H* (X) is
injective.
To see this, suppose that ¢;*(o:) = 0 for
E HJ(X).
By Poincare
duality, there exists a (3 E H 2n-J(X) with ex U (3 the (cohomology) fundamental
class v E H 2n(X). But then, the isomorphism above gives a contradiction
o#- ¢;*(v)

THE SYMPLECTIC BLOW-UP
127
Hence, ¢;* is injective and, from the long exact cohomology sequence associated
to the inclusion of X into the mapping cylinder of ¢;: X
----t X (which has the
same homotopy type as X of course), there is a short exact sequence of graded
vector spaces
o ----t H*(X)
----t H*(X)
----t H*(X,X)
----t O.
The last group denotes the cohomology of the pair (M¢, X), where M¢ is the
mapping cylinder of ¢;.
Moreover, we can compute this group by the excision
property of cohomology.
Recall that the excision property means that there is always an isomorphism
H*(Y - U, B - U) == H*(Y, B)
where U is an open set in Y whose closure (J is contained in the interior of B.
Here we take Y = X, B =
and U = X - M = X -!VI. The last inequality
denotes the diffeomorphism between X and X outside M and !VI respectively.
Then
H*(X, X) = H*(X - (X -
- (",y - !VI))
= H*(M,!VI)
where, again, the last group denotes the cohomology of the mapping cylinder pair
given by the map !VI
----t M. (The very same argument also gives an isomorphism
H*(V, if) == H*(M,!VI) and, hence, an isomorphism H*(V, if) == H*(X,X).)
But now recall that, as the projectivized normal bundle of M in X, !VI has the
cohomology
H*(!VI) == H*(M)[a]/(a k + cla k - 1 + ... + Ck)
.
In particular, the map H*(M)
----t H*(!VI) is injective and the long exact coho-
mology sequence associated to the pair (M,!VI) breaks into short exact sequences
o ----t H*(M)
----t H*(!VI)
----t H*+I(M,!VI)
----t 0 .
Hence, we have
H*+l (X,

== coker(H*(M)
----t H*(!VI))
== coker(H*(M)
----t H*(E))
since E

Once these algebraic properties of the blow-up have been given, it still remains
to show that X has a symplectic structure. This can be done as in [Mc01], but
the argument is too complicated to give here since our focus is on the algebraic
topological aspects of the situation rather than the geometric ones. Nonetheless,
we shall state the necessary result and sketch its proof.

128
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
'I'heor-em 2.4 [McDl]. If M is compact, then the blow-up X of(X,w) along
(M, (J) has a symplectic form w which equals <p*w outside a neighborhood of
q;-l(M).
Sketch of Proof. First, McDuff constructs a closed 2-form p on E which restricts
to the canonical translation invariant symplectic forms on each fiber of the normal
bundle. The form p on V also corresponds to w on Wand the point of the proof
is to 'extend' p to p on V compatible with w on oV = oV = oW. McDuff goes
on to show that
p,=<P*P+Eq*O'
is a nondegenerate 2-form on V for certain small
E > O.
Here, cP: E ----7 E and
q: E ----7 M and 0' is a 2-form on M (essentially) representing the 'projectivizing
class' aand pulling back under q" to an exact form on Eo. Further, the restriction
of 0' to each fiber Cpk-l is the canonical Kahler class of projective space. The
hard part of all this, so far, is the proof that 15, is nondegenerate. Since q* 0' is
exact on Eo, then we can write 0' = d(3 for some l-forrn there. Let). be a smooth
function on V which is constant at I near M (thought of as the zero section of
q) and 0 near at!. Then define
- {p,
p-
cP* p + cd(>.{3)
on M
on V- j\l1
as a smooth 2-form on Ii. Then p is nondegenerate on V for small E and, because
p = <p* p outside a neighborhood of M in Int(V), then it is possible to define w
on X by
on X-W
on V .
o
Of course the sketch above has left out many details and is only meant to
convey a slight taste for the complexities involved in constructing a symplectic
form on the blow-up. There is one other algebraic fact which must be mentioned
about the construction of this form and this is another reason we have sketched
the proof above.
As we mentioned previously, excision provides an isomorphism H* (V, V) ='
H*(M, M).
Also, because V
----7 M
is a disk bundle, we have V
:::::' M
and
H*(V) =' H*(M). Comparing the long exact sequences of the pairs (V, V) and
(M, M), we see that we must also have H*(V) =' H*(M) =: H*(M)[a]j(a k +
... + Ck). Thus, if we write the class of M's symplectic form (J as b, then we may
think of b as an element of H*(V). Also, since p on V corresponds to w on W,
then <p* p on V corresponds to
(J on M under ir: E ----7 M. Similarly, we think of
the class a as belonging to H*(V). Then, we have

THE MAIN RESULT
129
Coronary 2.5. The cohomology class of the blow-up's symplectic form w (as
in Theorem 2.4) is given by
[w IIi] = b+ fa .
Proof. From the definition, w= p, + exact on if and [p,]
**[0"] + fa = b+ fa.
3. The Main Result
[<p* p] + e[g*a] =
o
Now that the definition of the blow-up, its cohomology and symplectic struc-
ture are understood, we can consider the following situation. Suppose (M 2n - 2k, 0")
is a compact symplectic submanifold of ccpn all of whose (tangent bundle) Chern
classes vanish.
Example 3.1. If a manifold is parallelizable (i.e. the tangent bundle is trivial),
then all Chern classes vanish. By Theorem 2.3.11, we see that all manifolds of
the form GIf, where G is a Lie group and I' is a lattice contained in G have
vanishing Chern classes.
In particular, by Corollary 2.3.12, nilmanifolds have
vanishing Chern classes, so M above may be taken to be any of the examples of
symplectic non-Kahler nilmanifolds we have discussed earlier in Chapter 2.
In [Tisch], it was shown that ccpn is a universal integral symplectic manifold
in the sense that any symplectic manifold with integral symplectic form may
be embedded in a ccpn such that the standard Kahler form pulls back to the
given symplectic form.
Gromov showed, in fact, that n = 2m + 1 for a given
2m-dimensional symplectic manifold. Thus the situation above is generic in this
sense.
Example 3.2. Let M = KT, the Kodaira-Thurston 4-manifold. Then KT may
be embedded symplectically in the lO-dimensional manifold CCP5. By Theorem
2.3, the blow-up CCP5 is simply connected (since CCP5 is) and has cohomology in
degree 3 given by H1(KT) . a. Then, since dim(H1(KT)) = 3, we have
dim(H 3(CCP5)) = 3 .
But, recall from Chapter 1.3
odd degree betti numbers of a Kahler
manifold must be even.
Hence, \Cp5 is a closed simply connected symplectic
manifold which cannot be Kahler. This is then the first such example.
Example 3.2 may be generalized to handle the situation described above.
Namely, let (M2n-2k,0") be a compact symplectic submanifold of \Cpn all of
whose Chern classes vanish and suppose wis the symplectic form on the blow-up
CP5 along M such that [w] = b+ fa (as in Corollary 2..5).
Recall that, as in
Chapter 1.:3, the Hard Lefschetz property says that, for a symplectic manifold
(N 2n,w), multiplication by powers of the cohomology class [w] of the symplectic
form must induce isomorphisms

130
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
Then, we have
[McDl]. If the Hard Lefschetz property fails for M, then it also
fails for CP5.
Furthermore, in this case, the blow-up CP5 is a closed simply
connected symplectic manifold having no Kahler structure.
Proof. For notational convenience (and to conform with the general situation),
let X = cpn and X =

----+ ker(Hi(X)

Hi(V)). Hence, Hi(X)
----+ W(V) will be injective whenever Hi(X)
----+ Hi(V) is.
But, H*(V) =H*(M) and the embedding j: (M 2n- 2k,0') '-----. (cpn,w) satisfies
i*w = 0' so that, on cohomology as well, i*[w] = [0'].
Since [0'j2n-2k f. 0,
then [wj2n-2k f. °also and, because H*(X) = H*(cpn) = ,;z [[w]]j([wj2n+l) ,
therefore, Hi(X)
----+ Hi(V) is injective for i ::; 2n - 2k. Thus, Hi(X)
-r--r Hi(V)
is injective for i ::; 211 -
2k as well.
Furthermore, by the same argument, the
kernel of Hi(X)
H'(V) for i > 211 - 2k is generated by an appropriate power
of bE H2(X) where b is the image of wunder Hi(X)
Hi(X). Note that, by
the commutativity of the diagram above, b restricts to b = [0'] E H 2(V ) also.
Now, as we have mentioned previously, H*(V) =H*(M) = H*(M)[a]j(ak +
cla k- 1+ .. '+Ck) where the Ci are the Chern classes of the normal bundle v: E----+
M. Let's compute these Chern classes now. First, note that, by definition of the
normal bundle of the embedding M '-----. cpn,
TM (-j-J v =TCpnl M ,
so the product formula gives c(TM)c(v) = c(TCpnI M ) (where c( ) denotes
the total Chern class).
Now, by hypothesis, c(M) = I and it is well known
that c(Tcpn) = (I + [w])n+l. Chern classes are also natural under pullback, so
c(TCpnI M ) = (l+bt+ 1 since b = [0'] is the pullback of[w] under the embedding.
Then, taking components separately, the product formula gives

Thus, ak contributes one factor of b and each power over k contributes another
by successively applying (1). Now let us use this on the second sum above. The
index j goes from j = k - 1 to j = n - i - 2. For the term with j = k - 1, the
power of b which occurs is bn-i- j- 2 = bn-i- k- 1 and the power of a which occurs
is aH 1 = ak . By (1), this factor produces an extra factor of b in the term which,
in turn, increases the total power of b to bn - i - k . This is precisely the power of
b required to annihilate v, so the first term of the sum vanishes. Then, for each
successive term, the power on b decreases by 1 and the power on a increases by
1, Therefore, by the principle enunciated above, the a factor provides exactly the
extra factor of b to give each term in the sum a factor of bn - i - k
Thus, each
such factor annihilates v and each term in the sum vanishes.

Now let's return to the proof of the theorem. Of course, we are trying to say
that X does not satisfy Hard Lefschetz by showing that multiplication by some
power of w has a kernel. The lemma above says that, if y E Hi+ 2(X ) restricts
to av E H i+2(fi ), then

THE MAIN RESULT
133
yw = y(b + ciit-i- 2
t----> av(b+ cat- i - 2= 0
so that y(b + cii)n-i-2 is in the kernel of H*(X) ---+ H*CV). (Note that we must
have w= b+ cii by the injectivity of H*(X) ---+ H*(V) in low degrees. Also note
that such a y exists because av E jf*(M)[a]j(a k + ... + Ck) = A* c H*(X).)
We have already seen however that this kernel consists of zero and multiples of
bi for i > 2n - 2k. If y(b + cii)n-i-2 = 0, then we have a contradiction to Hard
Lefschetz and we are done. If y(b + cii)n-i-2 is a multiple of a power of b (which
we can take to be the power of bitself without loss of generality), then the total
degree of y(b + cii)n-i-2,
(i + 2) + (2n - 2i - 4) = 2n - i - 2,
be even and greater than 2n - 2k. Hence, y(b + cii)n-i-2 is a multiple of
bn - m where 2m = i + 2 < 2k. (For the inequality, simplify 2n - i - 2 > 2n - 2k.)
For m < k, note that the elements iijbm-j, j = 0, ... ,m are linearly independent
in H 2m(X ) (since the only relations are (2) and (3)).
Lemma. The equation
in the unknowns Xo, ... , X m always has a solution either for T =°or T = l.
Proof. To see this, note that the left side of the equation may be written as a
linear combination of the m + 1 terms bn-m and iiJ/;n-m-j for k - m -:; j -:; k - l.
This is because we have

and because the individual terms reduce as follows.
If 1+ j -:; (k - m) - 1 then we have (up to a multiple using (3))
iil+J"bn- 2m-(I+j) = iil+j- 1 (iibn-HI) bk- m-(I+j+l)
= iil+j-Ibn-k+2bk-m-(l+j+l)
=iil+j-Ibn-m-(I+j-I) .

134
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
By induction, such terms reduce all the way to bn - m
If k - m:S 1+ j:S k - 1, then the iil+jbn-2m-(l+j) are the elements listed as
iijbn-m-j for k - m:S i : k - 1.
If 1+ j 2: k, then iil+j reduces by (2) to lower powers of ii, thereby increasing
the powers of b in a particular term. As we argued before, the powers of bare
increased precisely enough to put us in the situation of the first two cases.
Once it is clear that the left side of the equation of the lemma is a linear
combination of m + 1 linearly independent elements, then successively setting T
equal to 0 and 1 gives two sets of m + 1 equations in m + 1 unknowns having
the same coefficients. Thus, one of the sets of equations must have a nontrivial
solution.
0
Here is the upshot to all of this. In the lemma above, if the nontrivial solution
solves the set of equations with
T = 0, then S E H2mCf{) is III the kernel
of multiplication by wn - 2m and Hard Lefschetz is contradicted.
On the other
hand, if S solves the set of equations having T = 1, then we may use the element
y obtained above to write
Now S cannot restrict to av, so S cannot equal y. Therefore, S - y is a nontrivial
element of the kernel of multiplication by wn - 2m and Hard Lefschetz is again
contradicted.
Thus, the assumption that Hard Lefschetz does not hold for M
implies that it does not hold for X also.

4. Remarks
Now that we have a general construction for the construction of closed man-
ifolds which are simply connected, symplectic and non-Kahler, there are many
further questions which arise. In particular, although Theorem 2.3 gives much
insight into the cohomological structure of the blow-up, we have
P'roblern 4.1. Determine the homotopy structure of the general blow-up X
in terms of M, X
and the embedding.
In particular, determine the rational
homotopy type of the blow-up.
This problem does not seem so easy. The particulars of the construction are not
very 'homotopy friendly'.
Of course, the last part of the problem gets at the
crucial question of what distinguishes symplectic from Kahler. namely, Theorem
1.3.7 showed that Kahler manifolds are formal spaces in the sense of rational
homotopy theory. As we have seen in Chapter 2 however, non-toral nilmanifolds

REMARKS
135
may be symplectic, but they are never Kahler because they are never formal. Is
this non-formality in the face of symplecticness simply a product of a nontrivial
fundamental group? Where exactly is the line of demarcation here?
Question 4.2. Are closed simply connected symplectic manifolds formal? In
particular, are the blow-up examples of Theorem 3.3 above formal?
Remark 4.3. Greg Lupton has provided a heuristic argument which does not
deal with this question, but sheds some light on the formality relation between
X and X. As we have seen, the map X -> X induces a surjection on homology.
Although we have not discussed it in this book (and that is one reason we say
that the argument is a heuristic one), there is a dual approach to minimal models
in terms of differential graded Lie algebras. In this approach due to Quillen, the
free generating vector space of a minimal differential graded Lie algebra model
for a space is the rational homology and a space is formal if the differential in the
model is quadratic. That is, the differential on generators produces polynomials
with each term a bracket of length 2. Lupton's argument says that the surjection
on homology of the blow-up map gives a surjection on the generators of the
models for X and X. Then, if the differential on the model for X is quadratic,
the generators for the model of X map to a generating set for the model of X
which has quadratic differential as well. Titus, if X is formal, then X is formal.
This is not so helpful for Question 4.2, but it does say that if we can produce
some simply connected symplectic X which is not formal, then we can produce
many more via the blow-up.
Finally, we have used the Lefschetz type criterion in Chapter 2 and a natural
question to ask is how prevalent it is. We can use McDuff's blow-up to provide a
general construction for manifolds satisfying the Lefschetz type condition [L02].
Remark 4.4. Let (X 2m , wx) be a Kahler manifold and let (y 2n , wy) be a simply-
connected symplectic manifold. The product X x Y is a (2m + 2n)-dimensional
symplectic manifold with symplectic class w x + Wy. One easily checks that it is
of Lefschetz type. Now, recall that, if a manifold M admits a Kahler structure,
then all odd Betti numbers b2i +1(M) are even. So suppose in addition that the
symplectic manifold Y has some odd Betti number that is odd. Then so too does
the product X x Y. For if b2i +1(Y) is the first odd Betti number which is odd,
then
Since X is Kahler, each b2j+ l (X ) is even, and by assumption each b2j +1(Y) for
j < i is even.
Hence each term in the right-hand sum except the last, which is
odd, is even and so b2i+1(X x Y) is odd. It follows that X x Y cannot admit a
Kahler structure.
Furthermore, if X is a non-simply connected Kahler manifold and if Y is a
simply connected symplectic manifold having an odd betti which is odd, then

136
THE EXAMPLES OF MCDUFF
x x Y is again of Lefschetz type, has an odd odd betti number and, so, cannot
admit a Kahler structure. Starting with McDuff's examples of simply-connected,
symplectic manifolds that have an odd betti number which is odd, one obtains in
this way many examples of symplectic manifolds of Lefschetz type that cannot
admit a Kahler structure.

CHAPTER 5
SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES IN
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
In this chapter we analyze constructions of symplectic and Kahler structures
in total spaces of bundles. To extend our possibilities of building examples, we
first describe symplectic homogeneous spaces. Here, one of the most important
'negative' results is proved.
Contrary to the solvmanifold case, there are no
symplectic non-Kdhler compact homogeneous spaces of semisimple Lie groups
(Borel's theorem). This result is very old (1954), but we think that it is worth
presenting here. Our experience shows that, although the theorem is well known
to the majority of researchers, many fewer people know the reason for it.
Next, we discuss the Weinstein problem for fiber bundles with an emphasis on
fat bundles -
an important class of bundles in symplectic geometry. The reader
will find a complete description of this beautiful construction with new examples
(which are also non-homogeneous).
As far as rational homotopy itself is concerned, we discuss the formalizing
tendency of symplectic structures.
The discussion of this topic requires a bit
of work with minimal models of homogeneous spaces of compact Lie groups
and this is presented here as well as a rather complete exposition of methods
of calculating minimal models of such spaces.
Thus, this chapter yields many
examples illustrating the material of Chapter 1. Note that a substantial part of
our exposition is contained implicitly in [GHV], but as far as the authors know,
with the exception of the survey part of [Trl]' there is no detailed exposition in
the language of modern rational homotopy theory.
1. Preliminaries on Homogeneous Spaces
Here we recall some basic tools of compact Lie group theory and fix notation.
We assume that the reader is aware of the basic material (especially with root
systems) contained in, for example, [He] and with some facts concerning Lie
algebra cohomology.
To develop minimal model theory, we need, first, a convenient model of a
compact homogeneous space G j H.
As the reader may guess, this is done by
taking an appropriate subalgebra of invarzant forms in the whole differential
graded algebra DDR(G j H).
Let r(g): G j H ---; G j H denote a left translation
r(g)(aH)
gaH. Define an averaging operator
f1: DDR(GjH) ---; DDR(GjH),
(f1(w))x = !c(r(g)*w)xdg,
for any x E G j H and a hi-invariant measure on a compact Lie group G such
that Ie dg = 1. Obviously do f1
f1 0 d. Let
D'D"R(GjH) = {e E DDR(GjH)I r(g)*e = e, for all 9 E G}.

The theorem below allows us to find a finite dimensional model for OJ H (see
[GHV]).
Theorem 1.1. Let OJ H be a homogeneous space of a compact connected Lie
group O. The natural inclusion
j: fJvk(OjH) --+ fJDR(OjH)
is a quasi-isomorphism.
Outline of Proof. We give all essential details of the proof leaving to the reader
some technical details as an exercise.
First, note that since 0 is connected, there exists a smooth path -y: JR --+ 0
connecting the identity e EO and an arbitrary element 9 E O. Then the mapping
<Il: JR X OJ H --+ OJ H given by
<Il(x, s) = -y(s)x,
x E OJ H,
s E !PI.
is a smooth homotopy between 7(g) and idc/H. Now, we claim that there exists
an open covering {Ui,
1 ::; i ::; m} of 0 and a family of smooth mappings
'Pi: U, X JR --+ 0, i = 1, ... , m, such that, for any 9 E Ui, 'Pi(g, s) = e if s ::; 0 and
'Pi(g,S) = 9 if s 2: 1. Define smooth mappings Wi: U, X OjH X JR --+ OjH by
Wi(g, x, s) = 'Pi(g, s)x and set
<Ilf(x,s) = Wi(g,x,S), for x E OjH and fixed 9 E Ui.
As we have mentioned before, <Ill is a homotopy connecting idc/Hand 7(g) and
depending smoothly on 9 E Ui . Therefore, we get the homotopy operator k;:
fJDR(Oj H) --+ fJDR(OjH), where k; = p" 0 (<Ill)* for p: OJ H
--+ OJ H X JR. One
can check that
7(g)* - idc /H = do k; + k; 0 d.
Let (fi) be a smooth partition of unity on 0 subordinate to the covering {U;}.
Define the linear operators kl and kg of degree (-1) by
if 9 E U,
otherwise
and
m
kg = Lkf.
i=1
It is easy to notice that the equality
k((}) = Lkg(O)dg
correctly defines the linear operator k: fJDR(0 j H) --+ fJDR(0 j H) of degree
(-1) such that

PRELIMINARIES ON HOMOGENEOUS SPACES
Jl - idc/ H = do k + k 0 d.
The latter equality implies
Jl* = idH*(c/H) .
Obviously, if we regard the average operator Jl as a morphism
W (0.DR(G/H),d) ----> (0.DR(G/H),d)
139
then Jl 0 j = Jl and j
0 Jl = Jl. Therefore, j* 0 Jl* = id, Jl* 0 j* = id and j*
IS an
isomorphism. This completes the proof.

All effective methods of calculating minimal models of homogeneous spaces of
compact connected Lie groups are based, in fact, on the result below.
Theorem 1.2.
Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, there is an isomorphism
(0.DR(G/H),d) == (0.f?(G),dc)
where dc is a standard differential in 0.DR(G) and (0.'ft (G), dc) denotes a dif-
ferential algebra of G­in variant differential forms on G which are simultaneously
Ad(H)­invariant and generated by alternating forms in
Therefore, the
differential graded algebra (0.ft (G), dc) is a model for G/ H .
Proof. Consider, first, the differential graded subalgebra
(0.f?(G),dc) C (0.DR(G),dc).
Recall that it is defined by
0.1t(G) = {w E 0.DR(G)1 L(g)*w =w, Ad h*w = w for all hE H,
and We E
We claim that
0.ft(G) == 0.DR(G/ H).
Let
'Jr: G
----> G/ H be a natural projection.
Consider the usual pull-back
'Jr*
restricted to 0.DR(G/ H). We claim that this map yields the required bijection.
Indeed, let B be a G-invariant form on G/ H and let 'Jr*B be the corresponding

pull-back.
For any g E G we get L(g)*7f*fJ = (7f 0 L(g))*fJ = 7f*T(g)*(J = 7f*(J
which means that 7f*fJ is a left-invariant form. Next, take h E H. We get
Ad h*7f*fJ = (7f 0 Ad h)*fJ= (L(h) 0 7f)*fJ = 7f* L(h)*(J = 7f*fJ
which shows that 7f*fJ is an Ad(H)-invariant form. Moreover, if Xl,··' , Xk E 9
and Xi E
for some i, then (7f*fJ)e(Xl, ... , Xk) = fJ((lT*)e(Xd,··· , (IT*)e(Xd) =
0, since (IT*)e(Xe) = 0. Thus, we have proved that the image of 11'* lies in the
required algebra. It remains to prove that this map is bijective. It follows by
a straightforward calculation that 11'* is injective. To prove that it is surjective,
take W E 0,'lt(G).
Obviously, the tangent. map (IT*)e: 9 ---> TH(G/ H) induces
an isomorphism of
onto the tangent space TH(G/ H). Each w defined below
induces an alternating k-form We E

which, in turn, induces
an alternating k-form on TH(G/ H) and, hence, the corresponding G-invariant
k-form fJ on G/ H. This definition is correct. since
We is Ad( H)-invariant. Since
W is left-invariant, 11'* fJ = w. The proof is complete.

any advanced book on Lie groups such as rOY] or [Bou].

the subalgebra given by the formula

A parabolic subalgebra is any subalgebra containing a Borel subalgebra.
Of course, all our definitions are independent of the choice of the Cartan
subalgebra [He], rOY], [Bou].
In what follows we will also consider complex
algebrazc groups [Ham], rOY]. Since we will use them only once, we won't give
any details related to their theory, referring to, for example, [Bo] or [Ham]. Here
we summarize several properties of linear algebraic groups which we need in the
proof of Borel's theorem. The following results are well known:
(1)
Any complex semisimple Lie group admits the structure of a linear com-
plex algebraic group;
(2) If gO is a complex semisimple Lie algebra and GC is a corresponding
algebraic (complex Lie) group and b is a Borel subalgebra, then there
exists a connected (solvable) algebraic subgroup B C GC with Lie algebra
b;
(3) A connected algebraic subgroup P C G C is called parabolic, if its Lie
algebra is parabolic. A homogeneous space GC/ P admits the structure
of a projective algebraic variety.
We will also need the following property of semisimple Lie algebras.

The aim of this section is to present as many calculable examples of sym-
plectic and Kahler manifolds as possible.
Of course, as is typical in geometry,
computable examples of a given geometric structure arise from invarzant struc-
tures of this type on homogeneous spaces. In the previous chapters we considered
homogeneous spaces of nilpotent and solvable Lie groups. Now we would like to
analyze the case of homogeneous spaces of sernisirnple compact Lie groups. How-
ever, as we prove below, we cannot expect to find new examples of symplectic
non­Kahler manifolds since, when restricted to homogeneous spaces of sernisim-
pie compact Lie groups, these two classes of spaces coincide.

Theorem 2.1 (Borel). Let (;/[1 be a simply connected homogeneous space
of a compact semisimple Lie group G and assume that G/V is endowed with a
symplectic structure. Then the following conditions hold:
(1) V::: Zc(T) for a torus T C V;
(2) G/V is Kehletuui.
Proof.
Note that without loss of generality G /V admits a G-invariant symplectic
form w (see Section 1).
Therefore, w E

Consider the center C::: 3(U) of u and the centralizer 3g(C) of Cin g. We claim
that (2) together with Proposition 1.5 imply the equality
3g(C):::U.
(3)
Indeed, the inclusion 3g(C) =:J U is obvious. The opposite inclusion is not evident.
To prove it, we need the following fact which we leave to the reader as an easy
exercise in the basics of the Lie group theory (see for example [Wo]).

Eilenberg complex Ag*:
bw(X I , X 2 , X 3 ) ::: -w([X I , X 2], X 3 ) + w([X 1 , X 3 ) , X 2 ) - w([X 2 , X 3], XI) ::: 0.

Indeed, since w E

for all Xl, X 2 E 9 and V E u.
This identity together with the previous one
implies

143
Since 9 is semisimple, H 2(Ag*) = 0 (Proposition 1.5) which is equivalent to
9 = [g, g] and, therefore, to w(g, u) = 0 as required.
Next, since [w]P of 0 for p = dimg - dimu, the induced 2-form w on g/u is
non-degenerate. This implies
u = (g)-1,
with respect to w.
Now, we will prove that 3n(C) is also w-orthogonal to the whole Lie algebra g,
which will complete the proof. Note, first, that both u and 3n(C) are reductive in 9
as Lie algebras of compact Lie groups. This means that for the complexifications
UCand 3n(C)C we can write down the following root decompositions:

latter fact follows easily from the identities

to g. Therefore,

and, hence, u is a subalgebra of maximal rank.
The latter implies 3n(U) = C

Now, the proof follows from the following result ([Bou, Prop.

Define a compatible hermitian
metric on GCI Lx which appears to be Kahlerian.
Of course, the whole con-
struction is then transferred to Gill via the above diffeomorphism.
A Kahler
structure on GCI Lx is defined as follows. For the primitive roots 0'], ... ,O'm we
get
O'i(X) >0,
l=l, ... ,m
(since T = Za(x) and since X must be in the interior part of the Weyl chamber).

and, therefore, w determines an invariant 2-form on GOI Lx.
One can check by

In the general case,
Cj are still positive since only

proved both assertions (1) and (2) of Theorem 2.l.
Remark 2.3. In fact, one can prove a stronger version of this theorem which
shows that the Kahlerian condition implies that G jU is simply connected. We
prefer to prove the result in the simplest form which reveals, however, all essential
ideas and techniques.
Remark 2.{ Note, that Zwart and Boothby [ZB] showed that Borel's theorem
cannot be extended to non-compact semisimple Lie groups. We formulate this
result without proof.
Theorem 2.5. Let M = GjU be a compact homogeneous space endowed with
a G-invariant symplectic form. Assume tuet. G acts on M almost effectively. If
G is semisimple, then it must be compact.
Remark 2.6.. Zwart and Boothby [ZB] also proved that the 'building blocks' for
compact homogeneous symplectic manifolds are compact semisimple Lie groups
and solvable Lie groups.
Theorem 2.7. Let M = GjU be a compact homogeneous space endowed with
an invariant symplectic structure.
Assume that G is simply connected and let
G = S
)<J R be the decomposition of G corresponding to tile Levi decomposition

Then the invariant symplectic form w decomposes into the sum of
symplectic forms Ws +Wr which become invariant symplectic forms on S'j(U n S)
and Rj(U n R). Therefore,
(GjU,W) == (Sj(U n S'),w s ) x (Rj(U n R),wr ) .
3. The Weinstein Problem for Fiber Bundles
In Chapters 2 and 3 we discussed the construction of symplectic non-Kahler
stuctures on nilmanifolds and solvmanifolds. It is very important to analyze the
possibility of solving the same problem for total spaces of fiber bundles. We shall
refer to this question as the Weinstein problem for fiber bundles.
In the non-
simply connected case the problem was solved by A. Reznikov [Re]' who used
twistor methods (see Chapter 6) and by Fernandez, Gotay and Gray [FGG] by
means of rational homotopy theory. Up to now, attempts to construct a simply
connected compact symplectzc non- Kdhler manifold as a total space of a fiber
bundle have failed. A partial explanation is contained in [We] and [AT2]. Namely,
up to now there are no examples of non-formal simply connected manifolds
carrying symplectic structures.
Moreover, the authors of [LOl] formulated the
following stimulating conjecture.

THE WEINSTEIN PROBLEM FOR FIBER BUNDLES
147
Conjecture (Lupton-Oprea). Any compact simply connected symplectic man-
ifold is formal in the sense of ,SuJJivaIJ.
On the other hand, it turned out that, algebraically, it is not very difficult
to construct Sullivan twisted models which are symplectic, formal, but do not
satisfy the Hard Lefschetz condition. We present this result here, since potentially
it may be important. Of course it is just an algebraic analogue of a geometric
situation which remains quite murky. Note that, in what follows, we denote free
graded algebras
Poly(X) C9 Exterior(Y)
by
following a tradition of commutative algebra. This notation is quite natural since
all differential graded algebras which we deal with are elliptic.
Example 3.1. Let (M 1, dd, (M 2 , d2 ) E Im.-DGA be graded differential algebras
defined as follows:
deg(X) = 2,
deg(Y) = 4,
deg(x) = .5,
deg(y) = 7.
Assume that a twisted tensor product
is symplectic. Then (M, dr ) is a symplectic but non-Lefschetz algebra.
Proof. From the definition of d; and degree reasons one obtains
To prove this claim, one simply compares the appropriate degrees. For example,
the possible expression for d; (x) is of the form
dr(x) = XY + u(x)Z + v(x)z,
u(x),
v(x) E M 2 ,
but, since
deg(dr(x)) = 6,
deg(Z) = 8,
deg(z) = 15,

148
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
one obtains u( x) = v(x) = o.
The same argument is valid for the remaining
cases.
Again, by the degree reasons, the possible expression for dT(y) is of the
form
dT(y) = X 4 - y 2+ fJZ,
fJ E JR.
Obviously, to obtain the symplecticness of (M, dT ) , we should impose fJ -# O. On
the other hand, this condition turns out to be sufficient since the cohomology
class [X] E H*(M,d T ) is symplectic:
and
[X]9 = [X]8. [X] =fJ[Z]· (YF· [X] = 0
(because of the fact that the formal cohomology dimension of M is 16).
Thus, (M, dT ) is symplectic but non-Lefschetz since the linear mapping L[X]4
H 4 -J- H 12 has a kernel:
L[XJ4 ([Y]) = [X]4 . [Y] = O.
Example 3.2. Let Q4 denote the complex quadric In CP5.
There exists a
rational fibration
with a cohomologically symplectic non-Lefschetz total space E.
Proof. From the Schlessinger-Stasheff work [SSt], we can derive the existence of
a fibration
with
(ME,dE) == (M 1 NT M 2,dT ) .
Obviously, (M 2 , d2 ) is a minimal model of the sphere 8 8 . It is known that
In fact, we can calculate (see the next section) the minimal model of a quadric
directly from the Cartan algebra of the homogeneous space
Q4 = 80(6)/80(2) x 80(4).

THE WEINSTEIN PROBLEM FOR FIBER BUNDLES

o
So far, we cannot say more in the simply connected case.
In the non-simply
connected case, the Weinstein problem for fiber bundles is solved by the following
result [FGG].
'I'heorom 3.3. Let E 4 be a principal circle bundle over E 3 which in turn is a
principal circle bundle over a torus T 2 ,
so that the first Betti number of E 4 satisfies 2:::; bl(E4 ) :::; 4. Then
(i) ifbl(E4 ) = 2, then E 4 has symplectic but no complex structures;
(ii) ifb j(E4 ) = 3, then E 4 has both symplectic and complexstruetures, but
no positive deiinite Kahler metrics. However, E 4 does carry indefinite
Kahler metrics;
(iii) bj(E4 ) = 4 if and only if E 4 is a 4-torus T 4 .
Outline of Proof. The proof is based on the Kobayashi classification [Ko] of
principal circle bundles (which correspond to cohomology classes over "£ in the
second cohomology group of the base). If 0', {3 are integral closed l-forms on T 2
which are everywhere linearly independent and having the property [0' 1\ (3] E
H2(T2,"£), then the minimal models of E 3 and E 4 (satisfying (i) and (ii)) can
be calculated explicitly by the Halperin theorem (Theorem 1.4.4):
(M E 3 , d) = (A(O', (3, ,), d),
d(O') = d({3) = 0,
d(/) = nO' 1\ (3,
(M E4, d) = (A(ct,{3",7]),d),
d(O') = d({3) = 0,
d(/) = nO' 1\ (3,
d(7]) = pcx 1\, + q{3 1\ ,)
with the appropriate integers n, p, q.
It is not very difficult to check that in cases (i) and (ii) the model for E4 is not
formal. This fact combined with the Kodaira classification of complex surfaces
[BPV, FM] implies the proof.
0
In this framework we mention also the following result of Lupton-Oprea.
'I'heor-em 3.4 [LOI]. The total space of any rational fibration having fiber
cpn-l and base a non-toral nilmanifold of dimension 2n is not formal and hence
does not admit a Kahler structure.
Proof. The proof follows from the following interesting observation:
'I'heorom 3.5 [LOI]. Let B be a rational Poincare duality space of dimension
2n, and suppose

150
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
is a rational fibration (that is, Jrl(B) acts nilpotently on H*(cpn-l)). Then E
is formal if and only if B is formal.
Proof. The proof of this theorem is of an algebraic nature and uses Theorem
1.4.4. Namely, consider the Koszul-Sullivan extension
(AV, dB) -+ (AV ® lR[X] ® A(y), dE) -+ (lR[X] ® A(y), dF)
associated to the given fibration. Here of course, (AV, dB) denotes the minimal
model of B, (lR[X] C9 A(y),dF) is a minimal model of cpn-l and, therefore,
dF(X) = 0, dF(y) = X n, deg(X) = 2, deg(y) = n + 1. From the definition of
the K.S. extension,
dE(X) = 0,
dE(y) = X n + 7],
7] E (A+V ®lR[X])2n.
Since (AV, dB) is a differential graded algebra with Poincare duality, we can
assume that 7) is decomposable and, therefore, (AV®lR[X]®A(y), dE) is minimal.
Hence, we have found the minimal model of E. Suppose that E is formal. By
the Formality Criterion 1.3.1
Vffi(X,y) =CffiN
where de vanishes on C and the ideal (N) satisfies the property that each cocycle
in (N) is a coboundary. Obviously
v = Cv d:J Nv ,
where
Cv = C n V,
Nv = N n v.
We claim that dB(Cv) = 0, dB is injective and (Nv) satisfies the same property
as (N) with respect to de.
If we proved this, the formality of (AV, dB) and,
hence, B would be shown.
Take ex E (Nv) C AV and assume that dB(ex) = 0. Next, we analyze the re-
quired property of (Nv ) according to possible degrees of ex. First, if deg( ex) > 2n,
it follows that ex = dB ({3) since B has dimension 2n. Therefore, we can assume
that always deg( ex) ::; 2n. Again, consider the following two cases separately: 1)
deg(ex) ::; 2n - 1 and 2) deg(ex) = 2n. In the first case
dE(ex) = dB(ex) = 0,
and
ex E (Nv) C (N)
===>
ex = dE({3E)
where (3E E AV ® lR[X] ® A(y). Note that deg({3E) ::; 2n - 2. The latter implies
{3E = {3B + {3x, {3B E AV, {3x E AV . lR[X]+ (recall that deg(y) = 2n - 1 and y
does not occur in the expression of (3x). The freeness of the minimal model of
E implies now
(this is straightforward, apply de to {3B + (3x and usc the Leibniz rule). Hence,
the required property is proved in case 1).
If deg(ex) = 2n, one can notice that deg({3E) = 2n - 1. Again, ex = dE({3E).
Now, however

!3x E A+V .
But, for degree reasons, the latter implies dE(fJx) = 0 and A = 0 (otherwise,
the expression for dE(y) would contain terms with X, which is impossible since
dE(fJE) E AV. Finally,
and (Nv ) satisfies the conditions of the Formality Criterion.
We have proved
thus that B is formal.
Suppose that B is formal. Then the differential graded algebra (A V
XL dE)
is also formal as a non-twisted tensor product of two formal differential graded
algebras. Now, use the following simple but useful result.
Lemma 3.6. Let (M, dM ) be a formal minimal algebra and u E zn(M) be
a cocycle such that [u] E Hn(M) is not a zero divisor.
Consider the natural
inclusion
p: (M, dM)
---t (M ®d A(y), d) = (N, d),
diM = dM,
d(y) = u .
Then p* is onto and N is again formal.
Proof of Lemma 3.6. Let p: M
---t H*(M) be a quasi-isomorphism such that
p* = id. Define PN: N
---t H* (N) by the rule
PN = p* a PM,
on
M
and
PN(y) = o.
A straightforward calculation shows that p* is onto and pAr = id. The proof of
the lemma is complete.
Coming back to the proof of the theorem, one can take
M = AV @
N = AV ®

and notice that xn+ TJ is not a zero divisor in H* (A V,dB) ®
Now, Lemma
3.6 completes the proof of Theorem 3.5 and, as a consequence, the proof of
Theorem 3.4.

4. Koszul Complexes and Minimal Models of
Homogeneous Spaces
The aim of this section is to present calculational methods in the minimal
model theory of compact homogeneous spaces. The basic result of this section
establishes a quasi-isomorphism

152
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
where (CC / H, 8) denotes the Carton algebra of a homogeneous space. The Cartan
algebra is a free algebra which, in the case of a semisimple Lie group G, is
generated by elements of degree > 1. The degree requirement allows us to get
the minimal model (M c /H, dM) as the minimal model ofa free algebra (CC/H, 8)
generated by elements of degree> 1. This can be done by a simple procedure
('Sullivan's algorithm' [Lei]).
We start with the definition of the Cartan algebra. In the sequel we consider
only compact semisimple Lie groups (although some results can be extended
to reductive Lie groups).
Let G/ H be a homogeneous space of a Lie group G
satisfying the above restriction.
Fix maximal tori T
::::> T' in G and H respec-
tively.
Denote by W(G) = Nc(T)/Zc(T) and W(H) = NH(T')/ZH(T') the
Weyl groups of G and H respectively. It is obvious that W(G) and W(H) act
by automorphisms on T and T' respectively and, therefore act also at the Lie
algebra level. In particular, there exist embeddings
W(G) C GL(t)
and
W(H) C GL(t').
It is a classical result which can be found in any book on Lie groups (e.g.
[AJ)
that W(G) and W(H) (as linear groups above) are finite groups generated by
refleciions . The linear actions of these groups can be extended in an obvious
way to the actions on symmetric algebras ffi!.[t] and ffi!.[t'] by
CT(f)(t) = !(CT­1(t)),
t E t,
f E ffi!.[t],
CT E W(G)
(with the same formula for t' and W (H)). The result which we formulate below
is a classical theorem of the theory of uiuaruuiis (see [F]).
Chevalley Theorem. The rings of invariants of the W(G)- (resp.
W(H))-
action on ffi!.[t] (resp. ffi!.[t']) are polynomial algebras:
ffi!.[t]W(G) == ffi!.[!I, ... ,fn],
n = dimt
ffi!.[t']W(H) == ffi!.[Ul,'"
, us],
.5 = dimt'.
That is, they are freely generated by !I, ... .I; and Ul , ... ,us respectively.
Note that in [F] the above result is formulated in a more general way since the
Chevalley theorem is valid for any finite group generated by reflections. We have
already seen that the cohomology algebra of a compact semisimple Lie group G
is an exterior algebra generated by the przmitive elements Yl, ... ,Yn E H* (G),
H*(G) == A(Yl, ... , Yn),
n = rank(G) = dimT.
Definition 4.1. By definition, the differential graded algebra

KOSZUL COMPLEXES AND MINIMAL MODELS
153
h = fjle·
(where all
Uj and fj
are determined by the Chevalley theorem) is called the
Cartan algebra.
Now, we are in position to formulate the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 4.2 (H. Cartan). The following quasi-isomorphism is valid.
Outline of Proof. The proof of this theorem is rather difficult from the algebraic
point of view (cf. [GHV, vol. III]). We will not repeat all technical details of it
here, but we will sketch briefly the method which enables us to obtain the result.
The required quasi-isomorphism follows from the following chain
(eG / H ,6)
(W(g,
dw)
(o'DR(Gj H), d).
(Dv'R(Gj H), d)
of quasi-isomorphisms. Here W (g,
IJ denotes the Weil algebra of the pair (g, b).
Thus our goals are to:
- define the Weil algebra;
- introduce the maps 0' and fJ.
We will omit the proof that these maps are quasi-isomorphisms however. Thus,
begin with the definition of W(g,
Recall the notation VV for the symmetric
algebra over a vector space V. Put

inclusion. Consider the extension of this map to i' : Ag* -T
Let dA denote a
map extending the standard derivation of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex Ag*
to the tensor product W(g,
by

154
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
Introduce also a derivation de :
----+ W(g, h},
It is possible to prove that dw = -dA + de is a derivation of degree 1. Finally,
(W(g,
dw ) will be called the Weil algebra of the pair (g, h).
Now, we want to construct a. Consider the particular case of the Weil algebra
W(g, g).
Let YI, ... ,Yn denote the basis of H* (G) in the exterior part of the
Cartan algebra. It is known that these elements correspond uniquely to some
elements WI, ... ,Wn in Vg* (under the transgression map, [GHV]). Moreover,
there exist c, E W(g, g)D) such that
dW(Yi
(X) 1 - c;) = 1 (X) uu .
Denote Ci = (1 ® j*)(c;) E W(g,
and define a : (CC/H, 8) ----+ (W(g,

by the rule
a(Yi
(X) 1) = Yi 0 1 - Ci,
i = 1, ... , n
«(I (X) u) = 1 (X) u,
u E Im.[t']
where, of course, we identify Im.[t'] with a subalgebra in
The latter identifi-
cation is also non-trivial. It follows, e.g. from [GHV, vol. III, p. 249]. Namely,
it is proved there that for any reductive Lie algebra
there is an isomorphism of
graded algebras
VU* ='
where dim U* = rankfh).
The morphism (3 is constructed as follows (we omit details completely). From
Theorem 1.2 we notice that for a connected Lie subgroup H, the differential
graded algebra (nJ3R( G/ H), d) is isomorphic to the differential graded algebra
(considered as a subcomplex of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex). The lat-
ter can be embedded naturally into W(g,
and the composition ofthis embed-
ding with the above isomorphism yields the required chain of quasi-isomorphisms.
This completes the sketch of the proof.
D
Our next goal is to analyze the formality of homogeneous spaces of semisimple
Lie groups.
For this purpose we are looking for a useful characterization of
formal Cartan algebras and, more generally, Koszul complexes. We begin with
the definition of the Koszul complex.
Definition 4.3.
(1)
A P-algebra is a pair (5,0'), where:
1) 5 is a positively graded associative algebra with identity,
2) p = tBkp k is a finite-dimensional positively graded vector space
which satisfies the condition pk = 0 if k is even,
3) 0': P
----+ 5 is a linear mapping, homogeneous of degree 1, which
satisfies the identity

(2) With each P-algebra 05' the following graded differential algebra is asso-
ciated.
In the tensor product S @ AP define a linear operator \7" by
setting

(here and below the symbol' denotes the deletion of the element). Some
direct calculations imply that S' @ AP becomes a graded differential al-
gebra if one defines the multiplication in 05' @ AP by the rule
(Z@ 11». (w@ \[I) = (-l)pqzw@ 11>\[1,
where Z E S,
w E S",
11> E AP P,
W E AP.
This graded differential algebra is called the Koszul complex.
The grading in 8 @ AP is defined as usual. If Z E St , Xi E PP', then
Z @ Xl /\ ... /\ X p E (8 @
Under the grading, \7" is the derivation of degree (+1).
There is a second
grading, defined by
S @AP = EBk(5 @APh
where (5@ APh = S@ Akp. Then \7" is homogeneous of degree (-1) with
respect to this grading, which is called the lower grading. The two gradings of
5 @ AP define the bigrading given by
8@AP =EBk,r(8 ® AP)'k,
(5@ AP)'k =(5@ AkPy
The elements of (8 ® Ak Py are called homogeneous of degree r , lower degree
k, and bidegree (r, k).
Since \7" is the derivation of 5 ® AP, the cohomology
algebra H* (8 ® AP, \7,,) inherits the gradings
The decomposition
H*(S ® AP) = Ho(8 @ AP) (f) H+(5 ® AP),

156
holds, where

Ho(5 ® AP) is a graded subalgebra and H+(5 ® AP) is a graded ideal.
Consider now (8 ® AP, \70-) E
A and define a linear map
Po- : 5 ® AP ---> AP
by setting
Po- (1 ® \It + z ® 1» = \It,

z E 5+ .
Direct computation shows that
Po- 0\70- = 0
and therefore Po- induces a morphism in
: H*(5 ® AP) --> AP
Definition 4.4. The homomorphism
is called the Samelson projection for
(5, 0"), the graded space
Ps = P n Im
is called the Samelson subspace of P and the graded subspace Ps of P such that
P = Ps EB Ps is called the Samelson complement for (5,0").
Definition 4.5. Let Q be an evenly graded finite dimensional vector space. A
P-algebra (5,0") with 5 = VQ is called a symmetric P-algebra.
Note that Cartan algebras are symmetric P-algebras and, therefore, results
obtained for the latter algebras are also applicable to any Cartan algebra. In the
sequel we will need the following characterization of symmetric cohomologically
finite-dimensional P-algebras. Note that our homogeneous spaces are compact
and we mimic this algebraically by saying that dim H* (VQ ® AP, 'V0-) is finite.
Theorem 4.6 [GHV, vol. III]. Let (VQ, 0") be a symmetric P-algebra such that
H*(VQ ® AP) has finite dimension. Then

We omit the proof of this theorem, as well as the two results below, referring
instead to [GHV].

Corollary 4.7 [GHV, vol. III]. The following conditions are equivalent:
dim P := dim P+ dim Q
157
Now, we will formulate an important theorem which describes formal symmetric
P-algebras.
Theorem 4.8 [GHV, vol.
III].
Let (VQ,O") be a symmmetric P-algebra with
Samelson subspace P.
Then the graded differential algebra (VQ C9 AP, \7a) is
quasi-isomorphic to (H*(VQ 0 AP, \7a), 0) if and only if the second condition of
Corollary 4.7 holds.
Now we want to derive from Theorem 4.8 a sufficient condition for formality in
the language of Cartan algebras. First, we need the algebraic notion of a regular
sequence.
Definition 4.9. Let R be any ring. A sequence aI, a2, ... , a., ... of elements
in R is said to be regular if each ai is not a zero divisor in the factor-ring
R/(al, ... ,ai-d.
Theorem 4.10. Let (VQ 0 AP, \7a) be a Koszul complex associated to a sym-
metric P-algebra.
Let YI, ... , Yn be a basis of P and let s := dim Q. Suppose
that
H* (VQ (:<J AP, V'a)
is finite-dimensional. Then the minimal model of (VQ 0 AP, V'a) is formal if the
following condition is satisfied: \7a(YI), ... , \7a(Ys) constitute a regular sequence
in VQ and
Proof. Note that by Theorem 4.8, s :::; n for any Koszul complex with a finite
dimensional cohomology algebra. Thus,
\7a(YI ), ... , \7a(Ys)
form a regular sequence,
and
Use the following lemma proved in [VS].
Lemma 4.11. Let (A, dA) E lW.-DGA be of finite type.
Let (J be the ideal of
A, generated by the exterior generators, and let A := A/(J. If Y is an exterior
generator ofA such that the imagcofdA(Y) in A is nonzero, we have H*{A, dA ) :=
H*(A, dA), where A := A/(y, dA(y)) and d is the induced differential on .A.
Now, to prove the formality of the minimal model of (VQ 0 AP, \7a), it is enough
to apply the previous lemma successively to each \7a(Vi), j

By this procedure we
obtain H* (VQ rg, AP, Va) = (VQ1('1a(yd, ... , Va(Ys))) C9 A(Ys+l, ... , Yn) and

We are now ready to state a suficient condition for formality of homogeneous
spaces in terms of their Cartan algebras.

In particular, this algorithm yields the minimal model of any compact
homogeneous space G/ H with semisimple Lie group G provided that the Cartan
algebra (CC/H, b) is given.
Sullivan's Algor-ithm. Let (AV, d) be a freely generated differential graded
algebra.
Assume that it is connected (V = E±lk>1V k ) and simply connected
(H 1(AV, d) = 0). Denote by A++ V the ideal in AV generated by all decomposable
elements and let d': V n ---+ Vn+ 1 be a differential given by the formula d' = do 1r

1r is a natural projection

Let V' be a complement of Irn d' in Ker d' and denote by W a complement of
Ker d' in V. Thus,
V = Im d' EfJ Vi EB W.
It is not difficult to check by a straightforward calculation that
AV = A(V') C9 A(W' E±l W)
where W' = d(W) C AV. Let C = A(W' E±l W). Denote by (C+) the ideal in AV
generated by elements of degree> 0 in C. We claim that the natural projection

and, therefore, is free. In fact, it is also minimal.
Thus, we have described an algorithm for calculating the minimal model of
any free differential graded algebra. Note that the proof of the claim formulated
above is straightforward.
Technical details are left to the reader, or she may
consul t [Le1].
Corollary 4.13. The minimal model of any Koszul complex associated with
a symmetric P-algebra is again a Koszul complex associated with a symmetric
P-algebra.
Using this algorithm it is easy to find minimal models of homogeneous spaces of
compact semisimple Lie groups.
Example 4.14. We will show how to calculate the minimal model of a homo-
geneous space Gj H of a compact simple Lie group G. This example also yields
a 'generic' non-formal example of a homogeneous space Gj H. Let
GjH = 8U(6)j(S'U(a) x 8U(a)).
We start with the calculation of the Cartan algebra associated with Gj H. Recall
that (CG / H, 8) is completely determined by:
(1) the degrees of the primitive elements of H*(G) (since they completely
determine the exterior algebra H*(G) = A(Yl,'"
,Yn)),
(2) the explicit expressions of i., ,,,.In in terms of the UI, ... ,Uk, where
Ii, i = 1, ... , nand Uj, j = 1, ... ,k are polynomials determined by the
Chevalley theorem.
Note that for each simple Lie group G, the data (1)-(2) above are well-known
[GHV, vol.
III], [F]. We won't reproduce the corresponding tables here, but
we use the relevant data in our situation. Thus, we know that the degrees of
primitive elements in H*(8U(n)) are a, 5, .. ' , 2n+ 1.
It is proved in [F] that the ring of W(S'U(n ))-invariants is described as follows.
According to the classical Cartan classification, the simple Lie group S'U(6) has
type A 5 and the Cartan subalgebra in .5u(6)iC is 5-dimensional [He]. However,
traditionally, the canonical coordinates in the Cartan sub algebra of .5u(6)rC are
chosen to be XI,· .. ,X6 satisfying the condition XI +X2+ ...+X6 = O. That is,
instead of 5 linearly independent generators, we take 6 linearly dependent ones.
This allows us to write the W(SU(6))-invariants in the very simple form
II =xf +

fz =Xf + xg +

Here we assign to Xi, 1 ::; i ::; 6 the degree 2. Obviously, the same method can
be applied to the subgroup 5'U(3) x 8[1(3):

Note that, for symmetry reasons, we denote the W(5'U(3) x 5'U(3))-invariants
by Ul, VI,U2, V2· One can verify by a straightforward calculation that
so that we obtain all the required data.
Therefore, we can write the Cartan
algebra of G/ H as

i=1,2
deg(uJ) = deg(vJ) = 4,
deg(u2) = deg(v2) = 6,
deg(yJ) = 3,
deg(Y2) = 5,
Thus, we have obtained a free model of G/ H.
Note that it is not minimal
since deg( Ul) = 4 and deg(YI) = 3 which is not compatible with the minimality

However, applying the Sullivan algorithm we get the minimal model

We complete this section with a result of S. Halperin [GHV, H2] on formality

Theorem 4.16 (Halperin). Any homogeneous space G/ H of a compact Lie
group G satisfying the condition
rank(G) = rank(H)

Proof. The proof is an obvious corollary to Theorem 4.12, since .5 = rank( H) =
rank(G) = n and this means that the sequence fl' ... .L. is necessarily regular.

5. Symplectic Fat Bundles
and the Formalizing Tendency
of Symplectic Structures
In [We]' A. Weinstein introduced a notion of fat bundle which has turned out
to be an important construction method in symplectic geometry. This section is
devoted to a systematic exposition of this technique.
Let P( M, G) denote a smooth principal bundle with base M, total space P
and group G having connection form () and curvature form n.
Let 1i and V
denote, respectively, horizontal and vertical distributions in T P.
Since n is a
tensorial form on P which is Ad G­invariant and g­valued, we obtain horizontal,
scalar valued­forms on P by taking compositions t; 0 n, t; E g*.
Definition 5.1. If 8 c g* is any subset, we shall call the given connection S­fat
if, for every E, E S' the form E, 0 n is nondegenerate on 'H in T P. In particular, let
o c g* be a co­adjoint orbit. We say that the given connection is O­fat if t; 0 n
is nondegenerate for any t; EO.
Theorem .5.4 below is the main result of this section. It allows for constructing
symplectic structures in total spaces of associated bundles. Note that in general

162
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
it is not easy to construct a symplectic structure in the total space even provided
that such structures exist on the base and the fiber. Amazingly, sometimes (using
Theorem 5.4) it is possible to construct symplectic structures in the total space
of the associated bundle in spite of the lack of symplectic structures on the base.
Let P(M, G) be the principal fibre bundle above with connection form Band
curvature form fl. Assume that a compact symplectic manifold (F, WF) is given
together with a symplectic and Hamiltonian G-action of a Lie group G.
Note
that there are slight differences in the definition of a Hamiltonian G-action given
by different authors. Therefore, to fix our terminology, we recall the notions of
hamiltonian action and moment map.
Namely, if G acts smoothly on F, then
each vector X E g generates a fundamental vector field X E X(F) given by the
rule
d
X f = dt It=o exp tX(J),
f E F.
As usual, we denote by £y the Lie derivative with respect to the vector field
Y. It is convenient to denote by iyo: the differential k-form iyo:(ZI, ... ,Zk) =
o:(Y,ZI, ... ,Zk) for the given fixed vector field Y E X(F) and a (k + I)-form
0:. Finally, recall that G acts symplectically on a symplectic manifold (F, WF) if
each map q-: F
---7 F preserves the form, 9*WF =WF.
Definition 5.2. A symplectic G-action on a symplectic manifold (F, WF)
IS
called Hamiltonian if the following conditions hold:
(I) there exists a linear map jJ.: g ---7 Coo (F) such that for any X E g
-dp,x = iKwF;
(2)
jJ.: g
---7 Coo(F) is a Lie algebra antihomomorphism (where of course,
Coo(F) is equipped with the Lie algebra structure provided by the Pois-
son bracket);
(3) a map u : F
---7 g* given by the formula
Il(J)(X) = jJ.x(J),
f E F,
X E g,
p,(J) E g*
is G-invariant in the sense that
Ad(g)* 0 p, = p, 0 g,
for each
9 E G
where, of course, Ad(g)* is the co-adjoint representation of G and the
og on the righthand side denotes composition with the action of 9 on F.
This map J.l is called the moment map of the G-action.
Remark 5.3. Not all authors include the second and the third condition onto
the definition of the Hamiltonian action (cf.
[AM], [AuI], [KiJ). Examples of
Hamiltonian actions can be found in these books.

SYMPLECTIC FAT BUNDLES

Theorem 5.4. Let E = P <c F be the total space of the associated bundle
of any principal bundle P(M, G).
Assume that (F,WF) is a symplectic mani-
fold equipped wiiu a Hamiltonian G­action and a moment map IJ: F -+ g*. If
(P(M, G) admits a connection 0 which is IJ(F)­fat, the total space E admits a
symplectic structure.
Proof. The idea of the proof is quite natural. We want to define a symplectic
form on tangent spaces Tp(E) = H p ffi Tp(F) as a direct sum of non-degenerate
2-forms on the horizontal and vertical spaces separately (this will guarantee the
nondegeneracy of the global 2-form on E). However, what is not evident is the
closedness of such a differential form. Thus, we will prove this fact by a geometric
argument using curvature properties. We will divide the proof into several steps.
First, recall several useful formulas involving fundamental vector fields, the
connection form and the curvature form in the principal bundle P(M, G) (see
[KN] for instance). For each A E 9 with fundamental vector field A. E X(P) (with
respect to the G-action on P), the following equality holds:
O(A) = A.
For each 9 E G
Here Ad(g)* denotes the adjoint action on g. Recall the structural equation
dO(X, Y) = [O(X), O(Y)] + n(X, Y),
X, Y E X(P).
In particular, for the horizontal vector fields X h , Yh,
Now, secondly, consider the principal bundle
rr
G
------+ P x F
------+ P <c F = E
and denote by JP and JF natural projections ie P x F -+ P and jF : P x F -+ F
respectively. Take the pull-backs jpO, jpn and j'FWF. To avoid clumsy notation,
use the same symbols 0, nand w, remembering, however, that they denote the
pull-backs defined above. Define the following l-forrn on P x F:
o:(Z)(p,J) = 1J(f) oO(p,f)'
(p, f) E P x F .
Obviously, jpO(p,J) =
Op E 9 and, therefore,
0: E nbR(p x F) is well defined.
Now, define the following 2-form on P x F:
fJ=do:-w.
We shall now show that fJ projects onto E.
That is, there exists a 2-form
fJE E nbR(E) such that

164
TOTAL SPACES OF BUNDLES
If*BE = {3.
To prove this assertion, we must show that B is G-invariant with respect to the
G-action on P x F and that, for each fundamental vector field A.,
iA./3 = 0.
The invariance of (3 is proved by a straightforward calculation using only the
G-invariance of the moment map and the horizontal distribution. To prove the
identity i!if3 = 0, consider the fundamental vector field A. on P x F.
We then
obtain
do:(A., Y) =A.o:(Y) - Y0:(A.) - o:([A., Y]) .
Use the well-known identity for the Lie deri vative LX 1] = i X dry +di X1] and apply
it to () and A to get
L!1.() = i!1.d()+ di!1.() = i!1.d()
(using the identity ()(A.) = A). Recall that
which, together with the previuos identity, implies
or
-o:([A.,Y]) = p(d()(A, Y)) .
From the structural equation above we get
dB(A., Y) = [()(A), ()(Y)]
since fl(A., Y) = 0. Therefore,
d()(A, Y) = p(d()(A., Y)) + A.()(Y) - Y()(A)
=[t[B(AJ,B(Y)] + d[t[B(Y),A] - d[tB(!1.)(Y) .
The definition of the hamiltonian action implies
Finally,
do:(A., Y) = [t[B(AJ,B(Y)] + [t[B(Y),Aj - d[tA(Y) = -d[tA(Y) =w(A, Y)

SYMPLECTIC FAT BUNDLES
165
which is equivalent to iAfJ = 0 since, by definition, j3 = do: - w. We have proved
that fJ = 'If. fJE. Now, it is obvious that dfJ = 0 and this implies the closedness
of fJE, dfJE = O.
Now, the final step of the proof shows that fJE is non-degenerate and, hence,
symplectic.
Note that the tangent map ('If. )(p,J) : 1-{.p EEl Vp EEl Tf F
-+ T,,(p,J) E
restricted to the subspace 1-{.p EEl Tf F yields an isomorphism of the latter onto
T(p,J) E. Therefore, it is enough to show that fJ is non-degenerate on 1-{.p EEl T] F.
Let X and Y be vector fields on P x F which have no vertical component. Then
fJ(X, Y) = dot X; Y) - w(X, Y) = -ll(O([X, Y])) - w(X, Y)
since O(X) = O(Y) = O. Again, the structural equation implies
-1t(O([X, Y])) - w(X, Y) = /10 [2(X, Y) - w(X, Y)
for the curvature form [2. Now, the fatness condition implies that It
0 [2 - w
is a non-degenerate 2-form on 1-{.p EEl Tf F (since it is a direct sum of two non-
degenerate 2-forms on 1-{.p (It(F)-fatness) and on T'] F (symplecticness of WF )).
The proof is complete.

Remark 5.5. This proof of Theorem 5.4 was found by W. Andrzejewski [An]. As
far as the authors know, this is the only complete proof of the Weinstein theorem
in the literature.
Note that it is not easy to construct examples of symplectic fatness explicitly.
A partial explanation for this is contained in Weinstein's remark in [We] that
'everything in sight is homogeneous'. Besides that, for any bundle morphism
f
pi -->
P
M ' --> M
rank(1t 0 r [2Iw) :::; rank(1t 0 [21'rd (J can only decrease the rank of the apropriate
2-form). Therefore, a fat connection can only be obtained in the case when one
exists in the appropriate universal bundle. The remaining part of this section
is devoted to explicit examples of fat bundles. We construct an example of an
O-fat connection in universal SO(n)-bundles and a non-homogeneous It(F)-fat
connection.
Exarnple 5.6:
Invariant Fat Connections. Let P(M, G) be a principal
bundle and let K be a connected Lie group acting on M transitively so that
M = K / H. We always assume that the action of K can be extended to a fiber-
transitive action on P by automorphisms of P(M, G). For example, this is always
true for G-structures, subbundles of the frame bundle L(M, GL(n,

Define the isotropy representation ,\: H

an element '\(h) E G such that h(uo) = R)"(h)UO'
An easy calculation shows
that ,\ is a well-defined homomorphism. Assume that M = K/ H is a reductive
homogeneous space. That is, assume there exists a decomposition
t =
EB m,
Ad(H)(m) C m.
Since K acts by automorphisms on P(M, G), it makes sense to consider K-
invariant connections in P(M, G). These are described by the Wang theorem.
Wang's 'I'Iieorern [KN].
Under tbe above assumptions there is a one-to-one
correspondence between K-invariant connections in P(M, G) and linear maps
Am: m --+ 9 such that
Am(Ad(h)X) = Ad('\(h)(Am(X)),
for each X E m and h E H. This correspondence is given by the formula
where B is a connection form and X is a fundamental vector field generated by
X E t on P. Here A is given by
A: t --+ g,
A(X) = ,\*(X),
if X
A(X) = Am(X),
if X Em.
The curvature form of B is expressed by
fluo(X, Y) = [Am(X), Am(Y)] - Am([X, Y]m) - ,\*([X, Yh)
where X, Y E m and [X, Y]m and [X, Yh denote the m- and h-cornponent re-
spectively.
In particular, the map Am = 0 obviously satisfies the conditions of the Wang
theorem and, therefore,
Am = 0
defines an invariant connection in P(M, G) which is called the canonical connec-
tion. Thus, we get the following result.

Since F is a non-singular algebraic variety in Cpl x CP2, it is a complex sub-

There exists a symplectic and Hamiltonian Sp(1) x 8p( 1)-action on the Hirze-

Proof. Define the required action of Sp(1) x Sp(1) on F via a natural projec-

Namely, set

This action is symplectic, since the action of U(2) x U(3) is symplectic on Cpl x

and consider the canonical connection in the principal bundle (2). An alternating
2-form (9) has a matrix (with respect to the basis Xl, X 2, X 3, X4) of the form

A straightforward
calculation shows that the brackets [Xi, Xj], (1 ::; i,j ::; 4) generate the whole
sub algebra .sp(1) x .sp(1) and that the following equalities hold:
Il14(x) = -P23(X),
PI3(X) =P24(X),
PI2(X) =-P34(X)
Finally, the matrix (Pij (x)) is non-degenerate, if at each point x E F at least one
element among PI2(X), IlI.1(X) and Il14(X) is non-zero.
Since [Xi, X j] generate
the whole h, the degeneracy of (Pij(X)) would imply p(x) = a at this point. It
was proved in [Aul] that zf a moment map P of a Hamiltonzan SU(2)-action on a
4-dimensional manifold vanishes at a point xo, then this point IS a fixed point of
the action. However, the SU(2)-action on F has no fixed points and, therefore,

Recall that the main stimulating conjecture in this chapter is the formalzzzng
tendency of symplectic structures. We end this section by collecting several par-
tial results which are related to the Lupton-Oprea conjecture. The analysis of
various classes of compact symplectic simply connected manifolds as regards the
tendency towards formality is an interesting prospect.
In particular, we begin
with
Conjecture 5.11. Let P(M, G) be a principal bundle ofa compact semi-simple
Lie group G and a be any co-adjoint orbit of G in the dual space g' to its Lie
algebra g.
Let E = P
X G a
be the total space of the associated bundle. If
P(M, G) admits an a-fat connection and M = H/ J{ is a compact homogeneous
space of a compact semi-simple Lie group J{, then
(1)
E is a compact symplectic manifold which is formal;
(2)
M is formal and rank H = rank J{.
Note that this conjecture still is not proved in its full generality since further
analysis has shown that the proof in [AT2] contains a gap, pointed out by Greg

Lupton, which requires at least an addtional assumption to be filled. Therefore,
we present here a heuristic argument which yields some evidence for Conjecture
5.11.
Assume that the image of the Weil homomorphism h p of the principal bun-
dle K
----7 K/H lies in a subspace of H*(K/H)
H*(CK/H,{j) generated by
Poly(X) C CK / H = Poly(X) ® Exterior(Y). We will make use of the following
notion.
Definition 5.12. By definition, a freely generated differential graded algebra
(Av even ® Avodd , d)
is called pure if
In most cases, we shall only be interested in pure DCA's which are also elliptic.
Recall that this means that the dimensions of the generating set V and the
cohomology H* (AV, d) are finite.
In what follows we will need the following
result.
Theorem 5.13 [L01]. Any simply connected cohomologically symplectic pure
minimal differential graded algebra is formal and has only even-dimensional co-
homology.
In particular, any simply connected, colwmologically symplectic homogeneous
space C / H is a maximal rank homogeneous space. That is, rank H = rank C.
Proof of Theorem 5.13. We use the Formality Criterion Theorem 1.3.1. Write
the pure minimal DCA as
(AV, d) =(A(X ttl Y), d)
with X denoting even generators veven and Y denoting odd generators vodd .
Assume the formal dimension of the DCA is 2k.
We can give a second lower
grading to elements of (A(X ttl Y), d) by defining the lower degree of an even
generator x E X to be zero, the lower degree of an odd degree generator y E Y
to be one and extending to products by requiring Ai . Aj = Ai+j . Note that, by
the 'pure' hypothesis, d(A;)
Ai - 1 .
Now, if w denotes the symplectic 'form' in (A( X ttl Y), d), then w E X6 since
(AV, d) is simply connected. By the multiplicative property of the lower grading,
wk E A6k .
Now suppose that 1] E Ideal(Y) and suppose that the cohomology
class [1]] f. O. By Poincare duality, there exists a class [il] with [1]] U [i]] = [w k ] .
But, because 1] E Ideal(Y), its lower grading is greater than or equal to one. Since
multiplication by [il] can never decrease the lower grading, the product [1]] U [i]]
must also have lower grading greater than or equal to one. This contradicts the
fact that w E A6k .
Hence, [7]] = 0 and 1] is therefore exact. We have actually proven more than the
formality criterion of Theorem 1.3.1. For, although Y contains the complement

SYMPLECTIC FAT BUNDLES
171
of the vector space of cocycle generators C, it maya priori contain cocycles
itself.
We have just shown, however, that this cannot be the case.
Hence, M
is formal by Theorem 1.3.1 and since odd degree cohomology must come from
Ideal(Y), we see that the cohomology is, in fact, evenly graded.
For the second part, a homogeneous space has a pure minimal model, so a
simply connected symplectic homogeneous space is formal with evenly graded
cohomology by the argument above. Furthermore, a homogeneous space is ellip-
tic, so the fundamental result of Halperin on elliptic spaces [H3] says that the
homotopy Euler characteristic X,,(G/H) must be zero. But G/H has
x,,(G/H) = rank H - rank G
so rank H = rank G and G/ H is maximal rank.
o
Now, consider the associated fat bundle E(M, P, G, 0). Theorem 5.4 implies
that E is a compact symplectic manifold.
Obviously, the co­adjoint orbit 0
is a compact homogeneous symplectic manifold, say G/U.
By Theorem 2.1
G/U must be Kahlerian and, in particular, must have U = ZG(T).
Hence,
rank(G) = rank(U). This means that the Cartan algebra (C G / v , 6) is a Koszul
complex of the form VQI ® ApI with dim QI = dim P' and the same is obviously
valid for its minimal model.
Using the Halperin­Thomas theorem we get the
following K.S. extension associated with the bundle E(M, P, G, G/U):
Now, it is possible to derive from the assumption regarding the image of h p that
(M H / K ®r MG /V, dr) is a simply connected, pure and symplectic differential
algebra. From Sullivan's algorithm we obtain that the same valid for the corre-
sponding minimal model and the required conjecture follows from Theorem 5.13.
Note, however, that this is only a heuristic argument and that it does not cover
all possible cases of the Weil homomorphism.
Remark 5.14. In fact, Theorem 5.13 is a corollary to a more general result in
[LOl].
We won't prove it here, referring to [LOl]. However, we will state the
result since it has proved to be a useful tool in studying formality. We say that a
differential graded algebra (A, d) has a second grading if there is a graded vector
space decomposition A = EfirEzAr such that Ar· As C Ar+s and d(Ar) CAr-I'
Compare the lower grading described in the proof of Theorem 5.13. Obviously,
the second grading is also inherited by the cohomology algebra. A differential
graded algebra endowed with the second grading is called a bigraded differentzal
algebra.
Note that if we want to define the second grading on a free algebra
(A, d) = (AV, d) by assigning lower degrees to generators in V and extending
them multiplicatively to AV, it is convenient to assume that (AV, d) is mznzmal.
In the latter case, the above procedure yields a bigraded differential algebra if
and only if d(Vr ) C (AV)r-l.
Theorem 5.15 [LOl]. Let (AV,d) be a bigraded minimal differential algebra.
Write the second grading V = Vr , Efi Vrz Efi ... with "i < r2 < .. , and suppose it

CHAPTER 6
SURVEY
This chapter is devoted to several topics which involve symplectic structures
on compact manifolds, but which are presented in less detail then those included
in the core Chapters 1-5. These topics are very important, but at present their
relation with the main theme of this book is either conjectural (as in the case
of Brylinski;s conjecture), or methodological as in the case of the Arnol'd conjec-
ture, or, finally, not well-explored (Dolbeault homotopy theory). We do however,
include some complete details such as the full proof of Mathieu's theorem on
symplectic harmonicity in the Dong Van version. This proof deserves special at-
tention because of its importance and elegance. Besides that, we give a survey of
several examples of symplectic non- Kahler manifolds whose construction involves
techniques which differ from the main ones considered in this book. These ex-
amples deserve special attention since their analysis from the rational homotopy
point of view may result in a new understanding of the whole problem. For in-
stance, it is amazing that iunstor bundles over some compact pinched manifolds
of negative curvature are always symplectic and non-Kahlerian (Reznikov [Re]).
1. Brylinski's Conjecture and
'Conjectural' Symplectic Invariants
Recently R. Ibanez and M. de Leon have obtained some interesting results
concerning a conjecture of Brylinski [FILl, FIL2, FIL3, DY]. These results seem
to be related (although not directly) to rational homotopy theory of compact
symplectic manifolds. O. Mathieu showed that this conjecture for compact sym-
plectic manifolds is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition [Ma]. Recently
Dong Van found an extremely nice proof of Mathieu's theorem [DY] and we
present it here.
Let M be a symplectic manifold of dimension 2n with symplectic form w. For
any smooth function f on M we denote by X f the Hamiltonian vector field of
f. Thus,
iXfw = df
where, as usual, ixfw(Y) = w(Xf, Y) for a vector field Y. The Poisson bracket
is defined by the rule
{f,g} = Xf(g) = -w(Xf,Xg ) ,
for f,g E CCXJ(M).
Let e be a skew-symmetric tensor field of order 2 determined by the equalities
i(G)(df 1\ dg) = {f, g},
[e,O] = 0

174
SURVEY
where [G. G] denotes the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, i(G) and the contraction
by G.
Definition 1.1. The K oszul differential 0 is defined by
One can check that
and therefore the following canonical complex is defined.
Definition 1.2. A differential form () is called symplectical/y harmonic if
d(} = 0(} = O.
This definition is motivated by the analogy with Hodge harmonic forms. Indeed,
we can introduce the operator 0 using the following symplectic star operator.
First, note that G is a skew-symmetric bivector field dual to wand, therefore, in
local coordinates it can be written as
where (Xl, ... ,Xn , YI, ... , Yn) constitute a canonical symplectic local coordinate
system given by the Darboux theorem.
The symplectic star operator can be
defined by
and we can then define 0 = * 0 do *.
The two definitions of 0 are, in fact,
equivalent.
Theorem 1.3 (Brylinski) [Br]. If M is a compact KaMer manifold, any de
Rham cohomology class in H*(M) lies a symplectically bermotiic representative.
That is, each de Rham class [v] is represented by a form v such that ov = dv = O.
Brylinski conjectured that the same result is valid for any compact symplectic
manifold.
This conjecture is. however, not true in general, as was shown in
[FIll, Ma, DYj. Moreover, Mathieu proved the following result (which obviously
implies Theorem 1.3).

BRYLINSKI'S CONJECTURE AND SYMPLECTIC INVARIANTS
175
Theorem 1.4 [Maj. A compact symplectic manifold satisfies the Brylinski con-
jecture jf and only jf it satisfies the Hard Lefschetz condition.
The results listed above indicate that there may ezisi some relation between
the theory of symplectic harmonicity [Br, FILl, FIL2, FIL3, DY] and rational
homotopy. This conjecture is motivated by the proof of Theorem 1.3.7 since that
result is based on subtle relations between standard harmonzcity with respect to
the Laplace operator and minimal models. It would be interesting to understand
analogous relations between d, 6, symplectic harmonicity and minimal models.
This understanding could help in solution of the conjectures of Benson-Gordon
and Lupton-Oprea as well as several other problems.
Dong Yan's Proof of Theorem 1.4.
The idea of the proof is based on the observation that, for a compact symplectic
manifold (M, w) the operators
L = L w ,
d,
,6,
L * = - * oL a *
acting on the de Rham algebra 0,DR(M) satisfy the following commutator rela-
tions:
[L, d] = 0,
[L, 6] = - d,
[L * , 6] = 0,
[L * , dJ = 6.
Next, the operator
(1)
2n
A =2)n - k)7rk '
k=O
where 7rk: 0,DR(M) -+ 0,hR(M) is the natural projection, satisfies the relations
[L*,L]=A,
[A,L]=-2L,
[A,L*]=2L*'
(2)
Let H, X, Y be a standard basis for the Lie algebra .s[(2) satisfying the relations
[X, Y] = H,
[H, X] = 2X,
[H,Y] = -2Y.
(3)
We see that relations (2) and (3) determine a natural .s[(2)-representation in the
(infinite-dimensional) vector space 0,DR(M) given by
X -+ L* ,
Y -+ L,
H -+ A.
Moreover, the identities (1) show that this representation can be restricted to an
5[(2)-representation in the subspace of symplectically harmonic differential forms
1ls0, C 0,DR(M). Now, the well-known properties of .s!(2)-representations show
that the map Lk = LWk : Hn­k -+ Hn+k is surjective if and only if the map
H*(1i s0" d) -+ H*(0,DR(M), d)
sending syrnplectically harmonic cohomology classes to all cohomology classes is
bijective.

176
SURVEY
Thus, we will complete the proof as follows. First, we will show that the identi-
ties (1)­(3) are valid. Next, we will discuss the properties of .s[(2)­representations
and, finally, we will show how to derive the required theorem from these proper-
ties.
Proof of Identities (1). Note first that
(L 0 d ­ do L)(B) = L(dB) ­ d(L(B)) = w 1\ dB ­ dw 1\ B­ w 1\ dB= 0
since w is closed.
This proves the first identity in (1).
To prove the second
identity, notice, first, that the identity
[L, i(G)]B = (k ­ n)B,
n =
dim M.
follows from the fact that it is obviously satisfied for any manifold with dim M =
2. Indeed, for dimensional reasons, both sides are zero on l­forrns, O­forms and
2­forms since we can write down the local expressions w = dx , 1\ dYl, G =
-s- 1\ ..jL and B = fdxl 1\ dYl and obtain the required identity by substituting
UYI
uII
these expressions into it.
Furthermore, since it is enough to show the identity
locally, we can assume that M is a cartesian product of 2­dimensional manifolds
and the proof then follows.
Now, let B E
The previous identity together with the second defi-
nition of 8 (8 = [d, i(G))) implies
[L, 8]B = L(8(B)) ­ 8(w 1\ B)
=L([d, i(G)]B) ­ [d, i(G)](w 1\ B)
=d(w 1\ i(G)B ­ i(G)(w 1\ B)) ­ (w 1\ i(G)(dB) ­ i(G)(w 1\ dB))
=d((k ­ n)B) ­ (k + 1 - n)dB = -dB
which proves the second identity in (1). The third identity is shown by restricting
both sides of it to each subspace n12R(M ). On each such subspace we get
(­ * oL 0 *) 0 (( _I)k * od 0 *) ­ ((­1 )k+2 * od 0 *) 0 (­ * oL 0 *)
= (-1 )k+l * oL 0 do * ­ (-1 )k+l * od 0 L 0 *
=(_I)k+l *o[L,d)o*
= 0,
since * 0 * = id. The last identity follows from the chain of equalities:
[L* , d) = * 0
( ­ L 0 * 0 d 0 * + * 0 d 0 * 0 L) 0 *
= (_I)2m-k * 0[8, L] 0 *
= (_I)k * od 0 *
= 8.

Proof of Identities (2). These identities follow from the equality
L* = i(G).
(4)
Indeed, the definition of A and the fact that [L, i(G)] = (k - n) id on
imply [L*,L] = [i(G),L] = A. By the same reasoning, the second and the third
identity in (2) hold as well.
Thus, it remains to prove (4).
This is done by appealing to the following
result proved by J.L. Brylinski in [Br]. Let (M1,wd and (M2,W2) be symplectic
manifolds of respective dimensions 2nl and 2n2.
For 0'1 a k1-form on M 1 and
0'2 a k2-f orm on M2, on M 1 x M 2 we have
The above identity implies the Leibniz rule for L * ,
where L 1 and L 2 correspond to WI and W2. Indeed,
L*(0'1 /\ 0'2) = *(w /\ *(0') /\ (02))
=*1(W1 /\ *I(ad) /\ 002 + a) /\ *2(W2/\ *2(002))
=
(ad /\ 0'2 + 001 /\ L; (002)
as required.
Now, the proof of (4) is accomplished by an induction procedure
with respect to dim M. When dim M = 2, we have
L*(ct) = 0 = i(G)O',
for any O-form and l-forrn, while for any 2-form fdx1/\dY1 and for G = -88 + -88
Yl
Xl
we get
as required. If dim M > 2, without loss of generality we can assume that M is
a product of two symplectic manifolds of positive dimension. Now, the Leibniz
rule for L * completes the proof.

sl(2)-Representations. These representations are studied in detail in [GrH]. Note
that for evident reasons we need to consider the case of infinite-dimensionol
representations. Therefore, we introduce, first, the following definition.

178
SURVEY
Definition 1.5. Let V be the (infinite-dimensional) vector space of a Lie algebra
representation
p: s[(2) ---> g[(V).
We say that V is an s[(2)-module of finite H -specirum if the following two con-
ditions are satisfied:
1) V is a direct sum of eigenspaces of H;
2) H has only finitely many distinct eigenvalues.
Now, the basic algebraic result concerning s[(2)-representations is the following
Proposition 1.6. Let V be an s[(2)-module of finite H -spectrum. Let, as be-
fore, H, X, Y denote the canonical generators ofs[(2). The representation p has
the following properties:
1) All eigenvalues of H are integers;
2) the maps
are isomorphisms for all k :::: 0;
3) the following equality holds:
{v E Vk I p(X)v = O} = {v E Vk I p(y)k+ 1 = O}
(6)
(5)
This proposition obviously implies the basic fact we need, the duality on forms,
since DDR(M) obviously admits the structure of an s[(2)-module of finite H-
spectrum (recall (2) and the definition of A = p(H)).
Corollary 1.7.
The maps
are isomorphisms for all k :::: O.
Identities (1) imply also that the structure of s[(2)-module of finite H-spectrum
is inherited by the subspace
1t.,DDR(M) =
of all symplectzcally harmonic forms.
Corollary 1.8. The maps
L k : u;» --->
k:::: 0
are isomorphisms for all k :::: O.
Thus, to complete this part of the proof, we must show that Proposition 1.6
holds. It follows from the following observation:
the formula

179
p(X)(p(y)k(V)) = p(y)k(p(X)(v)) + k(A - k + 1)p(y)k1(v),
V E V
holds for all egenvectors of p(H) corresponding to eigenvalue A. This formula
can be verified by a straightforward calculation and we leave it to the reader.
Now, as a corollary, we get the fact that, for v E V an eigenvector of p(H) and
W the JJ[(2)-submodule generated by v, W is a finite dimensional vector space.
Finally, this fact then implies Proposition 1.6 since, for finite dimenszonal JJ[(2)-
representations this result is well known [GrH].

The Final Step. Assume, first, that the Brylinski condition holds. That is, each
de Rham cohomology class contains a symplectically harmonic representative.
Then the natural map
must be surjective. Now, the commutative diagram

has two surjective vertical arrows and a bijective upper horizontal arrow (Corol-
lary 1.8) which imply the 'if' part of the proof.
Now we assume that Lk : Hn- k ­­­" Hn+k is surjective for all k :::; n. First we
claim that Hn-k can be decomposed into a sum (which is direct in the compact
case)
Indeed, by the surjectivity assumption, for any B E Hn-k(M) there exists ( E
Hn-k-2(M) with Lk+1(B) = Lk+2((). This is equivalent to
B- ( 1\ w E Pn - k
or
B= (B ­ ( 1\ w) + ( 1\ w E 1m L + Pn ­ k
as required.
Now we complete the proof by induction with respect to degrees of forms.
Obviously, O­cocycles and l­cocycles are symplectically harmonic. Assume that
when
r < n -
k. any class B E H" (M) contains a symplectically harmonic
representative. We show that any class in H n - k also contains such a cocycle. By
the induction hypothesis, any class in Im L contains a symplectically harmonic

cocycle.
Therefore, it suffices to show that the same is true for cohomology
classes in Pn - k .
Let v = [z] E Hn-k(M). Since [z 1\ w] = 0, there exists, E D';)tt+1(M) such
that z I\w = d,. Since Lk+ 1: D';)Rk-1(M)

choose 0' E D';)Rk-1(M) such that, =
(¥ 1\ w k +1. Then (z - dO') 1\ wk+ 1 = O. It
means that for w = z - do: we get
[w] = [z] = v,
an d
Lk+1(w) = O.
Now, an application of (I) completes the proof.
Indeed, Lk+1(w) = 0 implies
L*(w) = 0 because of (6) (recall once more that we have an 5[(2)-representation
in DDR(M) such that p(X) = L* and p(Y) = L). Now, using the fourth identity
in (1) we get
6(w) = [L*,d](w) = -d(L*(w)) = 0
which means that w is syrnplectically harmonic.
o
Theorem 1.4 shows that symplectic harrnonicity in the sense of Brylinski's
conjecture is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition. Therefore, we obtain a
tool for distinguishing between Kahler and non-Kahler symplectic manifolds. It
seems quite natural that further analysis will produce new homotopic invariants
related stnctly to symplectic structures. At present our knowledge is not satisfac-
tory. Of course, Theorem 1.4 yields a new proof of the fact that the only Kahler
nilmanifolds are tori since the Hard Lefschetz condition is violated for non-toral
nilmanifolds. (This fact was used in [FIL3], where the first explicit example of a
symplectic 'non-Brylinski manifold was given. As the reader might expect, the
example was the Kodaira-Thurston manifold).
We complete this section by mentioning several results 'around' the Brylinski
conjecture. It would be useful and interesting to analyze them from the ratio-
nal homotopy point of view.
In [Bo], Bouche introduced a natural differential
complex related to symplectic manifolds as follows. Let (M, w) be a symplectic
manifold of dimension 2n. Let
be the subspace of coeffective forms on M. Obviously the complex
is a differential subcomplex of the de Rham complex. Its cohomology HP (A( M))
is called coeffective cohomology of the symplectic manifold.
It was proved by
Bouche that the coeffective complex is elliptic for p 2': n+ 1 (that is, the coeffective
cohomology groups HP(A(M)) are finite dimensional for p 2': n+l). On the other
hand, it is known from [Bo] that the truncated de Rham cohomology groups

APPLICATIONS TO THE ARNOL'D CONJECTURE
181
are isomorphic to the coeffective cohomology groups in case the symplectic mani-
fold is actually Kahler. Therefore, again we get a tool for distinguishing between
Kahler and symplectic non­Kahler manifolds.
The authors of [FIL2] obtained
an analogue of the Nomizu­Hattori theorem (see Chapter 3.2) for the coeffective
cohomology of nilmanifolds and completely solvable solvmanifolds (the defini tion
of the coeffective cohomology for the Chevalley­Eilenberg complex is left to the
reader as an exercise).
In [FIL3] the authors considered two natural spectral sequences associated
with the J(oszul differential 0 = i(G) 0 d ­ do i(G) introduced in Theorem 1.4
and the de Rham differential d. It was shown in [FIL3] by example that the de-
generacy of the first spectral sequence is, in a sense, independent of the Brylinski
conjecture.
In [11] R. Ibanez considered the Brylinski conjecture for Poisson manifolds.
Note that the Koszul differential can be defined for any Poisson manifold and,
consequently, harmonicity of f} means that of} = df} = O. It was shown in [11]
that the Brylinski conjecture holds for compact cosymplectic manifolds. Recall
that a (2n + 1)­dimensional manifold M is called cosymplectic if it is endowed
with an almost contact structure (tP, 7/) which is compatible with a Riemannian
metric g and satisfies the following conditions:
(i) a 2­form <I> defined by the formula
<I>(X, Y) = g(1)(X), Y),
X, Y E X(M)
is closed;
(ii)
7J is closed;
(iii)
\l1> = 0 for the Levi­Civita connection \l.
In [12] a version of the Hodge decomposition for the coeffective cohomology
was given for Kahler manifolds. Some results were obtained also for indefinite
Kahler metrics.
2. Applications to the Original Arnol'd Conjecture
Arnol'd's conjecture is a well­known long­standing problem which has stimu-
lated the development of symplectic topology and geometry. Recall that Arnol'd
conjectured (see [HZ]) that the number of fixed points of for a Hamiltonian self-
diffeomorphism on a symplectic manifold M is at least as large as the number of
critical points for any smooth function on M. Conley and Zehnder proved the
conjecture for tori, but the lack of appropriate invariants forced a modification
of the conjecture (so that the lower bound is replaced by the cup­length of M)
and this modification was solved by Floer [HZ] through the development of his
homology theory. Ii is not the aim of this section to present here the difficult
analytical and topological aspects of the theory. We refer to [HZ], for instance,
for a complete modern account.
We present here only the rational homotopy
aspect of the problem. Although the original Arnol'd conjecture remains open

182
SURVEY
in general, the description of rational homotopy in terms of the algebraic min-
imal model allows for the definition of new and powerful algebraic invariants
which then must be related to geometry.
One of these, Toomer's invariant eo
was studied in [MO] and led to the affirmation of the original Arnol'd conjecture
for nilmanifolds. Because this result was proved by means of rational homotopy
theory, we discuss it briefly here.
The following result was announced by Poincare shortly before his death and
proved by G. D. Birkhoff in 191:3 [Hi]. The result is sometimes called Poincare's
Last Geometric Theorem or
Theorem 2.1: Birkhoff's Twist Theorem. Any area-preserving diffeomor-
phism of the annulus which rotates the inner and outer boundary circles in op-
posite directions has at least two fixed points.
In the 1960's Arnol'd saw how to generalize this theorem [Ar, Appendix 9].
First note that, for dimension 2, area­preserving is the same as symplectic. Also,
note that, the Lusternik­Schnirelmann (LS) category obeys cat(Annulus) + 1 =
cat(81 ) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 :S #(critical points of any function on the Annulus).
Hence, the number of fixed points of a 'symplectic' map on a manifold should
have something to do with the number of critical points of smooth functions on
the manifold.
Finally, the generalization of the twist condition is to consider
exact or Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. These are the diffeomorphisms of a sym-
plectic manifold which arise from a time­dependent Hamiltonian flow as follows.
Suppose (M,w) is a symplectic manifold and H: M x 8 1
­­­4 !PI. is a time depen-
dent Hamiltonian which is l­periodic in time. Denote the dependence on time
t by writing H, for H restricted to time t.
Then the symplectic form gives a
time­dependent Hamiltonian vector field XH defined by
w(XH , -
) = dH t ( - )
and has associated to it a flow ¢t with
d
dt¢t = XH(¢t)
and
¢o = 1M·
Let ¢ = ¢I be the time 1 map of the flow and say that any such map arising as
a time 1 map of a Hamiltonian flow is an exact or Hamiltonian diffeomorphism.
Arnol'd Conjecture 2.2. Let MC(M) denote the minimum number of critical
points for any function f: M
­­­4 !Pl.. Then the number of fixed points of an exact
symplectic diffeomorphism on (M, w) is at least MC(M).
This is equivalent
to saying that, for a time-dependent Hamiltonian which is I-periodic in time
H: M x 8 1 ­­­4 !Pl., the associated Hamiltonian flow has at least MC(M) I-periodic
orbits.
Remark 2.3. If M is aspherical, then MC(M) = dimM + 1.
Takens [Tak]
showed that M C( M) ::; dim M + 1 and Eilenberg­Ganea [EG] showed that
cat(M) = dim(M) for such a space. Since, by the original theorem of Lusternik-
Schnirelmann, cat(M) + 1 ::; MC(M), the equality follows.
A large step in understanding the Arnol'd conjecture came in 1983 [CZ] due to
Conley and Zehnder.

APPLICATIONS TO THE ARNOL'D CONJECTURE
183
Theorem 2.4. The Arnol'd Conjecture is true for T 2n . That is, there are at
least 2n+ 1 fixed points for any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on the torus. This is
equivalent to saying that, for a time-dependent Hamiltonian which is I-periodic
in time, the associated Hamiltonian flow llas at least 2n + 1 I-periodic orbits.
Conley and Zehnder first reduce the problem to finite dimensions by lifting
the symplectic structure and Hamiltonian from M = T 2n to M = !PI.2n . Periodic
orbits on !PI.2n project to contractible orbits on M and these are what are going
to be counted. While the analysis is too complicated to present here, suffice it
to say that the (L 2 ) gradient of the action functional (where x(t) is a I-periodic
loop)
OH(X) = t'
- H(x,t)dt
Jo 2
is doH(x) = -Jx - \7H(x, t). Therefore, a critical loop x gives
0= -]X - \7H(x, t)
J» = -\7H(x,t)
x = _(1)-1\7 H(x, t)
x = J\7 H(x, t)
by Proposition 1.2.1
So, periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian system correspond to critical points of
0H. Conley and Zehnder reduce the problem of finding these critical points to
finding the critical points of a special kind of function g: M x !PI.2m --+!PI.. All
critical points of 9 are in a compact invariant set S (contained in an isolating
neighborhood) of the gradient flow \7g(x) = x.
Let cg denote the number of
critical points of g. Conley and Zehnder show that cg 2: cup(T2n) + 1 = 2n + 1
and therefore prove the original Arnol'd conjecture for tori.
As we mentioned above, subsequent to the Conley-Zehnder proof, the Arnol'd
conjecture was modified to take account of the difficulty in estimating the number
of critical points on a manifold. The modification consisted of focussing on the
more computable cuplength of a manifold and applying the known result that
the number of critical points is bounded below by cuplength plus 1 (see 2.5 and
2.6 below).
In order to understand the rational approach to the problem of
estimating critical points, let's recall the notions of LS category and cuplength.
Recall that a space X is said to have LS category n if there exist n + 1 open
sets U, C X such that
n+l
X= UUi
i=1
and each U, is contractible in
X
and n is the least integer for which this is true. The second condition means that
there is a homotopy H : U, X I --+ X such that Ha is the inclusion and HI is the
constant map. One thing that we can say right away is that category is related
to cuplength.
Recall that the cuplength of X, denoted cup(X), is the largest

Xk. Here R is a ring of coefficients. The following result
is well-known and is the basis of many calculations of category.
Proposition 2.5. cup(X)::; cat(X).
Proof. Suppose cat(X) = k. choose any k + 1 elements X; E Hn,(X; R), i =

ucts then give (for N = L ji)

Since XIX2 ... Xk+1 maps to XIX2'"
Xk+l, the latter is zero as well. Hence, any
cup product of length greater than k is trivial and cup(X) ::; cat(X).

Properties of Category 2.6. Other important properties of category are given
by the following:
(1) Category is an invariant of homotopy type.
(2) If C, = Y u, CX is a mapping cone, then cat(Cf ) ::; cat(Y) + l.
(3) If X is a CW-complex, then, by induction on skeleta and property (2),
cat(X) ::; dim X .
(4)
In fact, (3) may be generalized: If X is (r-l)-connected, then cat(X) ::;
dimX/r.
(5) The category of a map f: X
----4 Y is cat(J) = n if n is the least integer
such that there is a covering of X by n + 1 open sets on each of which
f is nullhomotopic.
If f: X C Y, then cat(J) = catj- X, the relative
category of X in Y.
(6) The category provides a lower bound for the number of critical points
of a function on a compact manifold. That is, if M is compact, then
cat(M) + 1 ::; MC(M).
The proofs of these properties may be found in [Whi] and the excellent survey
[J] for example.
Examples 2.7.
(1) cat(X) = 0 if and only if X is contractible.
(2) cat(Sn) = 1.
(3)
More generally, cat(X) = 1 if and only if X is a nontrivial co-H space.
(4) cat(Tn ) = n (this follows from Proposition 2..5 and property (3) above).
(5) If (M 2n , w) is a simply connected compact symplectic manifold, then

:= n :=
dim M. First, observe that the volume form is not exact since
it represents a nontrivial fundamental class of M. Because w n In! := vol,
the non degenerate closed 2-form w cannot be exact either.
Hence, w n
represents a nontrivial cup product of length n in IR-cohomology. By
property (4) above, cat(M) :::; (dimM)J2 := n. Hence, n :::; cup(M) :::;
cat(M) :::;
dimM := n and the result follows.
In order to study category from the point of view of rational homotopy theory,
it is convenient to use another, more homotopical, approach. Let Mn+l denote
the product M x M x
x M (n + 1 times) and let
T n+l M:= {(Xl, X2,
Xn+l)! at least one Xi is a specified basepoint *}.
denote the fat wedge.
Include Minto M n +1 via the diagonal map 6,( x)
(x, x, ..., x) and denote the inclusion Tn+l M '-> M n+l by j. Then cat(M) := n if
and only if n is the least integer for which 6, may be deformed into T n +l M. That
is, there is a map 6,': M -> T n+l M and a homotopy commutative diagram,
M
6,' -,
T j
Tn+IM.
This is, of course, the Whitehead approach to category. Similarly, if I: M -> M
is a map of spaces, then cat(J) := n if and only if n is the least integer for which
there is a map 6,': M -> T n +l M and a homotopy commutative diagram,
M
IT
M
M n+l
---+
T J
Tn+IM.
Now, in order to translate these diagrams into rational homotopy theory, we
need minimal models for M, M, M n+l and Tn+l M.
If we denote the model
of M by (AV,d), then the model for M n +1 is simply AV0n +1 with d on each
factor and extended by the Leibniz rule.
Moreover, the model of the diagonal
map is simply multiplication, denoted by u : Ay0 n +1 -> AY. In [FH] it is shown
that a minimal model for the fat wedge T n +l M is given by a minimal model
¢J: AY --> n of the quotient DCA

where A+Y consists of all elements of positive degree. If 7T: AV0n +1 -> n denotes
the projection, then, since ¢ is a quasi-isomorphism, there is a lift
AV0 n +1 ->
AY with
::::: 7T (see Corollary 1.2.8). The DCA map
is, in fact, a minimal
model for the inclusion j of the fat wedge into the product. A direct translation
from spaces to minimal DGA's provides (with the notation above and where we
denote the model of M by AV and the model of I by F: AV --> AV)

Remark 2.9. Since a spatial diagram induces a diagram of minimal models,
clearly cato(J) :; cat(J). Also, it is important to note that Felix and Halperin
worked in the general situation of all path connected spaces. Thus, the minimal
model approach to category may be done for these spaces, but inferences are
generally only good for nilpotent spaces since it is in this situation that minimal
models are a true reflection of homotopy theory.
It is the presence of algebraic structure which allows a more accessible criterion
for the determination of rational category. Let A?:n+lV denote the differential
ideal of AV consisting of sums of monomials Xi, ... Xik having k ;::: n + 1 and
let p: AV
----+ AV/A?:n+lv be the projection. Take a minimal model (): AZ ----+
AV/ A?:n+lV and note that, since () is a cohomology isomorphism, there is a lift
p: AV ----+ AZ with (}p::: p. For details, see [FH, Definition 4.3 and Theorem 4.7].

Now, according to [FH, Theorem 4.7] and [Fe, p.126], we have
Theorem 2.10.
cato(M) = n if and only if if n is the least integer such that there exists a
DGA map r : AZ ----+ AV with rp::: idAv.
cato(J) = n if!nd only ififn is the least integer such that there exists a DGA
map r : AZ ----+ AV with rp::: F.
The theorem allows us to define invariants which may be used to estimate
cato(J). One of these is Toomer's eo invariant. The eo invariant is well known
for spaces [To] and minimal models [FH]. It was introduced in [MO] for maps.
Definition 2.11.
Define eo(M) to be the largest integer k so that there exists a cocycle 0: E

Define eo(J) (= eo(F)) to be the largest integer k so that there exists a cocycle

Now, p(a) = 0, so (J*p*[a] = p*[a] = 0. But (J is a cohomology isomorphism, so
p*[a] = 0. Finally, F*[a] = rp*[a] = 0. Therefore, no cocycle in A2: n +1V has
nontrivial image in cohomology. Hence, eo(f) :::; n = cato(f).
For 5, let
0: E A2: e o(M )V be a cohomologically nontrivial cocycle. Because F
is a DGA map it cannot decrease length, so F(o:) E A2: eo(M )V . Further, since
f* = F* is injective, F( 0:) is also cohomologically nontrivial.
Hence, eo(f)
eo(M). Together with part 3, this implies the result.

Now that we understand cuplength and category, we can understand the state-
ment of Floer's theorem. Floer's methods are deep and introduce completely new
techniques -
indeed a completely new homology theory suited for such problems
as the Arnol'd conjecture. Floer took the Conley-Zehnder variational approach
with a more general action functional defined on a type of loop space. Indeed,
one reason that a hypothesis (i.e.
7r2M = 0) such as the one in the theorem
below is necessary is to ensure that his action is well defined.
Again critical
points of the action correspond to contractible periodic solutions, but now the
estimate must be made in an infinite dimensional space -
and this requires a
method different from that of Conley and Zehnder. Floer invents his homology
to handle this estimation. But note that, since Floer works with homology, he is
restricted to a cuplength estimate. Good references for all of this -
especially
the variational analysis -
are [ABKLR], [HZ] and [McD3]. Floer proved the
Theorem 2.13 [Fl]. For any symplectic manifold (M, w) with 7r2M = 0, the
modified Arnol'd conjecture is true. That is, there are at least CUP2M + 1 fixed
points for any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, where CUP2M is the !Z/2-cuplength
ofM.
Remark 2.1.4. Floer actually proved more general results which require weaker
hypotheses than the vanishing of 7r2M, but the result above is the easiest to
state. In the past several years, even more refined results have appeared in this
vein (e.g. [Ono)).

Some time ago, Chris McCord had the idea to stay closer to the Conley-
Zehnder approach when considering the Arnol'd conjecture on manifolds one
step away from tori ­
nilmanifolds.
The variational analysis briefly outlined
above goes through in virtually the same way, but there is one difference later
on.
Namely, while Conley and Zehnder could achieve the Arnol'd conjecture
using cup length because cup(T2n ) =
271 = dim T 2n , for nilmanifolds this was
no longer the case. The cuplength and dimension of a nilmanifold may be very
different. Indeed, while there is a finite algorithm for calculating the cuplength
of a nilmanifold, there does not seem to be known a formula which gives the
cuplength of a nilmanifold in terms of invariants of the finitely generated tor-
sionfree nilpotent group say. So, what can take the place of the cup length as an
estimator of critical points? Certainly the LS category works. In fact,
Proposition 2.15 [MO]. Let M be a nilmanifold in the setting of the Arnol'd
conjecture. The number ofcritical points c9 of the special function g: M x m.2m --->
obeys
c9
catxS + I = cat(i) + I
where X = M x m. 2m , S is the compact maximal invariant set of the gradient
flow of 9 and i: 5' ---> X is inclusion.
Therefore, we are in the position of estimating the category of the inclusion map
i: S
---> X.
Some technical details arise here which we will ignore, but we can
also say that the inclusion i induces an injection on cohomology H* (M; Q) =:
H*(X; Q) ---> H*(S; Q). First, let's note
Lemma 2.16 [02]. If M is a nilmanifold, then eo(M) = dim M.
Proof.
By the definition of eo (Definition 2.11), we are looking for the 'longest'
product cocycle which represents a nontrivial cohomology class.
But we have
seen in our discussion of nilmanifolds that the top class is represented by the
longest product in the whole minimal model ­
the product of all generators.
Since the number of generators is the dimension of the nilmanifold, we are done.
D
Since category is trapped between eo and dimension, we have
Corollary 2.17. For a nilmanifold M,
(I) eo(M) = cato(M) = cat(M) = dimM.
(2) If f: S
---> M induces an injective homomorphism f* on cohomology,
then eo(J) = dim M.
Proof. The first part is clear. The second part follows from Proposition 2.12 (5)
and the preceding discussion.
D
As a result, we can prove the anginal Arnol'd conjecture for nilmanifolds.
Corollary 2.18 [MO]. IfM is a nilmanifold, then every I-periodic Hamiltonian
system has at least dimM + I = MC(M) I-periodic orbits. That is, the Arnol'd
conjecture is true for nilmanifolds.

In fact, we can prove more. The important points about the proof above are
the facts that we can do the Conley-Zehnder analysis on a universal covering
space which is jRN for some N and that we have an eo-invariant. Therefore we
have
'I'hcorern 2.19 [MO]. If (M, w) has universal cover a Euclidean space,
then
every I-periodic Hamiltonian system has at least eo(M) + 1 I-periodic orbits.
Unfortunately, for non-nilpotent spaces, just as for any minimal model in-
variant, the eo-invariant is not a very good estimator of category. There may
be hope for this approach however, for twisted minimal models are now making
their appearance with the goal of algebraicizing non-nilpotent homotopy theory.
If all of the rational category theory can be done for these twisted models, then
the twisted eo-invariant should play the same role as the untwisted one. Namely,
it should happen that, for aspherical manifolds covered by Euclidean space, the
twisted Co should be the dimension of the manifold and the Arnol'd conjecture
would hold exactly as before.
Beyond the question of the Arnol'd conjecture,
there seems to be much to be discovered about the role rational homotopy can
play in dynamical systems. For some new exciting work relating rational homo-
topy to Conley's index, see [Co].
3. Dolbeault Homotopy Theory
Dolbeault homotopy theory was developed in [NT] and can be characterized
as a version of Sullivan's theory for complex manifolds and their Dolbeault co-
homology. We outline briefly the contents of the Neisendorfer-Taylor paper since
results there have much potential for application, but as yet have not been uti-
lized to their utmost. We hope our exposition leads to a re-examination of this
subject.
Throughout, M is a complex manifold of complex dimension n, 0/:':/ is the
space of complex valued differential forms of type (p, q) on M. As in Chapter 1,

Definition 3.1. We define a differentzal bigraded algebra (DBA) to be a bi-
graded commutative algebra over (( with a differential a of type (0,1) which is a
derivation with respect to the total degree.
In this way we obtain the category CC-DBA of complex DBA's by requiring the
maps to be bidegree preserving and commuting with the derivation a.
Now, n:;.r* is equipped with the differential ain a standard way and we see
that (n:;.r*, a) E ((-DBA as well. By definition,
H*'*(n:;.r*, a) = H*'*(M)
is the usual Dolbeault cohomology. The usual de Rham cohomology is related
to H*'*(M) by the Frolicher spectral sequence.
Definition 3.2.
(i) A bigraded algebra is called BBA-algebra (bigraded, bidifferential) if
it is equipped with two differentials a and aof types (1,0) and (0,1)
respectively, such that
aa = -aa;
(ii) The cohomology of BBA is defined a/ways with respect to a­differential.
Observe that (n:;.r*, a, a) E ((-BBA.
Also, the reader should not confuse this
notion of 'bigraded' with the one involving a lower grading.
We have chosen
to use the original terminology because, at this point, no better terminology
presents itself to us.
The authors of [NT] prefer to use the Bousfield­Guggenheim version of rational
homotopy theory [BGu], using cofibrant models instead of Sullivan's minimal
models. They define a cofibrant DBA as follows.
Definition 3.3. A DBA­algebra (A, aA) is cofibrant if, given a map of DBA's
g: (B,aB ) ­­> (C, Be)
which is both a surjection and a quasi­isomorphism and a map of DBA's
I . (A, DB) ­­> (C, ae),
there exists a DBA-map h: (A, aA) ­­> (B, BB) such that go h = f.
By definition, a cofibrant model for a DBA (D, a'O) is a cofibrant DBA-algebra
(M, aM) which is quasi­isomorphic to (D, 0'0). Using these notions, we can also
define cohomotopy of DBA's and BBA's [NT].

DOLBEAULT HOMOTOPY THEORY
191
Example 3.4. We want to find a cofibrant DBA-model for Cl?"; that is, for
the Dolbeault complex
8). Now, the minimal model of Cl?" is given by
(Mrcpn, d) = (C[X] @ A(x), d)
d(X) = 0, d(x) = X n +1 ,
deg(X) = 2, deg(x) = 2n + 1 .
Since cpn is Kahler,
Thus,
H 2(cpn) = H1,1(cpn)
and the only possibility for assigning bidegrees to Mcpn is
which implies 8(x)
DBA
bideg(X) = (1,1)
X n +1 .
Since minimal models are cofibrant [BGu], the
(C[X]
A(x), 1J = d),
bideg(X) = (1,1), bideg(x) = (2n, 1)
is the cofibrant and minimal DBA-model for the Dolbeault complex
8).
Definition 3.5. A DBA or BBA-algebra (A,8A) is formal if there exists a
cofibrant algebra (B, 813) with maps (in the appropriate category)
(B, 813) ----> (A, 8A),
(B, 813) ----> H*'*(A, 8A)
inducing isomorphisms on the cohomology level.
Now, we shall introduce the notions of Dolbeault homotopy theory which are
most relevant for our work.
Definition 3.6. A bigraded bidifferential graded algebra (A, aA, 8A) is said to
be a-degenerate ifthere exists aBBA (M, a, 8) such that
(i) a = 0;
(ii) there is a map in the category C-BBA
(M, 8, 0= 0) ----> (A, 8A, aA);
(iii) (M,8) is a cofibrant model for (A, 8A) in the category C-DBA.
Definition 3.7.
(i) A bigraded bidifferential algebra (A, 8A, aA) is strictly formal if it is
a-degenerate and formal as an object in C-DBA;
(ii) A complex manifold M is Dolbeault formal if
a, 8) is formal as an
object in C-DBA.
M is called strictly formal if
0, 8) is strictly
formal as an object in C-DBA.

SURVEY
Theorem 3.8 [NT]. Any strictly formal complex manifold is also Dolbeault
formal and de Rham formal.
The relations between Dolbeault formality and de Rham formality are rather
subtle as examples in [NT] show.
For example, Stein manifolds appear to be
Dolbeault formal, but not de Rham formal in general.
Also, Calabi-Eckmann
manifolds are all Dolbeault formal, but not all of them are strictly formal (see
[NT] for details).
The most important results of [NT] can be summarized as
follows.
Theorem 3.9.
(1) Any compact Kahler manifold is strictly formal;
(2)
A a-degenerate manifold has a natural Hodge decomposition.
This
means that, in the category of a-degenerate manifolds, there exists a
natural isomorphism of cohotaotopy theories and a natural isomorphism
of cohomology theories.
Outline of Proof. (i) Recall from Chapter 2 that any compact Kahler manifold
satisfies the a8-lemma for
a, 8)).
Now, given any M satisfying the a8-
lemma, define K*M* to be the subalgebra (in the category C­DBA)
(K*M*,8) c (r2*M* ,8, 8), K*M* = Ker 0.
The above inclusion is a quasi-isomorphism (by the same approach as in Chapter
1). Choose a cofibrant model (M, 8M ) for (K*M*, 8) and notice that the sequence
of maps
(M*'*, 8M
, a = 0) --+ (K*M*, 8, a = 0) --+
8,a)
is a sequence of quasi-isomorphisms in C­BBA. Now, exactly as in Chapter 1,
we obtain strict formality from the sequence of quasi-isomorphisms
To prove (ii), notice that
8, 8) is a-degenerate and thus there exists a
cofibrant model (M, 8M , 0) and a quasi-isomorphism in C­BBA
Since this is a map in C­BBA, we get a map
(M, d = 8) --+
d)
which the Frolicher spectral sequence shows to be a quasi-isomorphism.

Remark 3.10. It is possible to prove that isomorphisms between cohomology
theories are independent of the choice of a cofibrant model [NT].

Corollary 3.11. Let M be any a-degenerate complex manifold. Then the Sulli-
van minimal model of M, (M, d), is simultaneously a cofibrant (minimal) model
for
0, 8) in the category C.-DBA.
Remark 3.12. This corollary leads to the following natural question: Are there
compact symplectic manifolds which are not strictly formal?
This question is
quite natural since the known examples are based on less refined invariants. It
would be quite interesting to find a complex compact symplectic manifold for
which non-Kahlerness follows from Dolbeault homotopy theory.
4. Miscellaneous Examples
In this section we will present several important examples which have some
specific features and are not covered completely by techniques developed in earlier
chapters.
Example 4.1 (Yamato [Yam]). This example exploits Thurston's idea of con-
structing symplectic non-Kahler manifolds as bundles over symplectic manifolds
with 2-dimensional fibers (e.g.
the Kodaira-Thurston manifold) together with
the calculation of triple Massey products (see Chapter 1).
To formulate the main result, we need several notions related to the Dehn
twist dijJeomorphisms of surfaces. Thus, let 2:g be an oriented closed surface of
genus
1. Let {aI, ... ,ag ; h, ... ,bg } be closed simple oriented curves on 2:g
satisfying the following conditions:
ai n aj = b, n bj = 0
for i i- j
and a; intersects bi at one point with intersection number (+1) for i = 1, ... ,g.
Definition 4.2. In the sequel we will call the system of curves defined above a
symplectic system.
Let T Z be a 2-dimensional torus with a coordinate system
(exp(Ol yCT), exp(OzR))
and let a and b denote the closed curves such that a(0)
exp(oR. Define a neighborhood of a U b by
exp oR, b(0)
U = {(exp 01H, exp oR) E T Z ,
-3f < 01 < 3f,
or - 3f < Oz < 3f}
where e > 0 is a small fixed number such that 3f <
Thus, we have neighbour-
hoods U, for all pairs ai Ubi and diffeomorphisms
i«: U;
U,
f(ad = a, h(bi ) = b
for all i.

Definition 4.3. A map T(a;) (resp. T(bi)) is called the Dehn twist diffeomor-
phism along ai (resp. bi) if it is a diffeomorphism
T(ai): 2:g -> 2:g
resp.
T(bi): 2:g -> 2:g
such that supp (T(ai)) C U, (resp. supp (T(bi)) C U;) and on Ui,
or, respectively,

(3) ,is strictly increasing on [-e,eJ.
Note that 2:g is an oriented surface and therefore is endowed with a volume
form v. One can show that this form can be considered as invariant with respect
to all Dehn twist diffeomorphisms. In what follows, we fix the volume form v.
Theorem 4.4 (Yamato, [Yam]). Let (N, fl) be a closed symplectic manifold
admitting a homomorphism

p(lTl(N)) = (T(cd, .. · ,T(cn)1 supp(T(c;)nT(cj) =fl

has non-vanishing triple Massey products.
Example 4.5 (Ferllandez-Gray-Morgan [MG]). This method also provides
examples of symplectic manifolds with non-vanishing triple Massey products.
These manifolds are constructed from lower dimensional symplectic manifolds by
taking circle bundles over mapping tori built over a compact symplectic manifold
(and constructed with respect to a given symplectomorphism).
Let (M, w, 'P) be a triple consisting of a compact manifold, a symplectic struc-
ture wand a symplectomorphism 'P.
Let N<p be a quotient of M x lPI. by the
infinite cyclic group generated by maps (m, t) -+ ('P(m), t - 1). To formulate the
main result we need the following lemma.
Lemma 4.6. For any cohomology class b E H 1(M, lPI.) such that 'P*(b) = b
there exists a closed l-Iorm fJ E nbR(N<p) whose restriction to M x {O} is a
representative of b:
[fJIMX{O}] = b.
A method of constructing symplectic non-Kahler manifolds is given by the fol-
lowing result.
Theorem 4.7. Let (M, w, 'P) and N <p be as above. Assume that there exists an
integral cohomology class b E H 1(N<p, Il) satisfying the assertion of Lemma 4.6.
Let
1r
8 1 -+ E ---+ N<p
be a principal circle bundle whose Euler class is a(b) E H 2 ( N <p, Il), where a is a
natural map in the Wang sequence

<p'-1

a

2
.. , -+ H (M,Il)
H (M,Il)
H (N<p,Il) -+ H (M,Il) -+ ...
Then
(1) E admits a natural symplectic structure;
(2) ifb -# 0 in H 1(M, lPI.), the total space E has non-vanishing triple Massey
products with respect to the pair (nDR(E), H*(E)) and, hence, E carries
no Kiihler structure.

SURVEY
Geometric Examples 4.8. Abbena [Ab], Watson [W] and Lopera [Lo] ana-
lyzed the problem of Weinstein­Thurston from the 'geometric' point of view.
That is, they tried to avoid more refined homotopic invariants looking for ex-
plicit examples of strictly almost K iihler manifolds, hermitian manifolds with
closed associated (1, I)­forms which are non­Kahler. Obviously, such manifolds
are symplectic and they are non­Kahler (with respect to the given hermitian
metric). The references [Ab] and [Lo] again deal with nilmanifolds, so although
they are covered by Chapter 2, explicit calculations of the non­integrability of
the corresponding almost complex structure may be useful in further analysis of
the Weinstein­Thurston problem.
Moreover, [Ab] calculates Betti numbers of
the Kodaira­Thurston manifold directly by using harmonic forms with respect
to the given metric and therefore, the final result again becomes universal (not
dependent on the given metric). In [W], a two parameter family of almost Kahler
non­Kahler metrics was built on a product of two solvable Lie groups.
Remark 4.9: Goldberg's Conjecture. In [Go] S. Goldberg conjectured that a com-
pact manifold equipped with an Einstein metric which is almost Kahler is in fact
Kahler. That is, the corresponding almost complex structure is integrable. There
are many results which give evidence for this conjecture [Se]. These results are
not related to homotopical considerations. It would be interesting to introduce
some rational homotopy to this analysis. This probably won't help in an affir-
mative solution, but it might help in looking for counterexamples.
Example 4.10: Twistor Spaces. We complete this section with a very geo-
metric result of A. Reznikov [Re] on symplectic non­Kahler structures on tunsior
spaces of oriented even­dimensional real vector bundles over even dimensional
manifolds satisfying some curvature conditions.
Again, deeper rational homo-
topic analysis of this theorem would be desirable.
We begin with a construction of a symplectic form on a twistor space.
So,
let B be a smooth manifold and TJ: E ­­­­+ B be a smooth vector bundle endowed
with a fiber­like Riemannian metric and an almost complex structure J.
We
assume of course that the metric induced on the fibers is Euclidean.
Let \7
be the corresponding Levi­Civita connection in E.
Take a tensor field T
E
Coo (T* (B) (9 E* (9 E) defined by
I
=
X E Cu(T(B)),
E Cu(E)
over some open U. One verifies that the new connection \7 given by
makes J parallel,
\7J =O.
Now, the modified connection is already complex linear and we can use the
Chern­Weil construction of characteristic classes of E using the curvature of this
connection. We can show that this curvature, R is given by the rule

Theorem 4.11 (Reznikov). Let M be a compact even dimensional manifold
and TM be its tangent bundle.
Consider the twistor bundles Z+(TM) and
Z" (TM).
Let w be the 2-form obtained by the construction above applied to
T M and the Levi-Civita connection in T M. Then:
(1) For any n
2 there exists an fen) > 0 such that for any f(n)-pinched
Riemannian metric on an n-dimensional manifold M, the twistor bundles
Z+ (TM) and Z- (TM) are symplectic with respect to a 2-form induced
byw;
(2) If the sectional curvature is negative (I«M) < 0), then the twister
spaces Z+ (T M) and Z- (TM) do not admit any Kahler structure.
Sketch of Proof. . We won't give a proof of the non-degeneracy condition for w.
(Note that the curvature conditions are essential, as one might expect from (7)).
The following argument ensures non-Kahlerness. Let E be one of the considered
twistor spaces.
It is known from twistor theory that the fiber of the twistor
bundle is homeomorphic to a Kahler manifold

Now, consider the generator f-l in the cohomology top dimension. By the Blan-
chard theorem, the Kahlerness of the fiber implies that 1T* f-l i= 0 in Hn(E, (Ql)
(where 1T is the bundle map).
Now, if E were Kahlerian, there would exist a
harmonic map ..\: E -
M homotopic to 1T and such that the rank of ("\*)e is < 3
at each point e E E (see the references in [Re]). Hence,
1T* (3 = 0

and we have arrived at a contradiction.

5. Discussion of Problems and Conjectures
The aim of this section is to summarize previous material in a unified way and
discuss the status of various problems.
Problem 1 (Thurston-Weinstein). Describe symplectic compact manifolds
with no Kahler structure.
The problem is solved in the class of nilmanifolds (Chapter 2) and partially
solved in the class of solvmanifolds (Chapter 3).
A completely different tech-
nique is used to solve this problem in the simply-connected case (Chapter 4). It
would be interesting to find broader classes of manifolds satisfying the Thurston-
Weinstein property. We mention the following related problems.
Problem 2 (Benson-Gordon). Find a solution of the Weinstein-Thurston
problem in the class of solvmanifolds and, more generaJJy, in the class of aspher-
ical manifolds.
Chapter 3 contains a more or less complete exposition of results obtained in
this direction. Recall the main stimulating conjecture for solvmanifolds.
Conjecture 1 (Benson-Gordon). If G is a completely solvable Lie group, a
solvmanifold GIf carries a Kahler structure if and only if it is an even dimen-
sional torus.
Some small evidence for this conjecture IS the proof in dimension four (see
Chapter 3).
Conjecture 2 (The 'Formalizing Tendency' of Symplectic Structures,
Lupton-Oprea) [LOI]. Any compact simply connected symplectic manifold is
formal.
Some evidence for this conjecture is given in the case of fat bundles over
homogeneous spaces (see Chapter 5). Therefore, it is quite natural to look for
other general methods of constructing symplectic manifolds.
In this respect,
coadjoint orbits [Aul, AuL] are homogeneous spaces, and therefore are not very
interesting.
(Indeed, the semi-simple case is obviously Kahlerian from Borel's
theorem (Chapter 5) and the solvable case was considered in Chapter 3). Quite
to the contrary, the case of symplectic quotients looks very interesting.
Let (F,w) be a compact symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian symplectic
G-action of a compact Lie group G.
Consider the moment map J.l: F
-t \B'
of this action and suppose that G acts on J.l-1(O) almost freely.
Then, by the
Marsden-Weinstein theorem,
x = J.l-1(O)/G
is a compact symplectic manifold which is called symplectic quotient: or the
Marsden-Weinstein reduction [Aul, Ka, Ki]. Thus, in our framework, it is quite
natural to formulate the following

DISCUSSION OF PROBLEMS AND CONJECTURES
199
Problem 3.
Describe the rational homotopy type of symplectic quotients.
Recently, J. Kalkman obtained a description of the multiplicative structure of
the cohomology of symplectic quotients [Ka]. A solution to Problem 3 may be
relevant to some problems in mathematical physics (see [Ka]). Now, it is natural
to formulate the most general problems in the area described in this work.
Problem 4 (Sullivan) [Su]. Are there algebraic conditions on the minimal
model (MM, d) of a compact manifold M implying the existence of a symplectic
structure on M?
Conjecture 3 (Thurston) [Th].
Let H * :::
H k be a finitely generated
symplectic algebra (satisfying Poincare duality).
There exists a compact sym-
plectic smooth manifold M such that H*(M) ::: H*
This problem is closely related to rational surgery [Ba]. Up to now, there are
no good approaches. The problem looks extremely difficult. At the very least,
the authors do not know any answer to the following question.
Problem 5 (Benson-Gordon) [BGl]. Are there symplectic structures on even
dimensional fake tori?
Problems 4, 5 and Conjecture 3 may be related to the recent results of C.
Taubes [Tal, Ta2] on the non-existence of symplectic structures on the connected
sum m Cp2#n CP2 (which is, of course, cohomologically symplectic). Namely, it
was proved in [Tal] that connected sums of 4­manifolds with non­negative definite
intersection forms do not admit symplectic forms which are compatible with the
gwen orientation;
For example, when m > 1 and n 2: 0, then mCp2#n Cp2
has no symplectic form which defines the given orientation, Symplectic surgery
is also related to the following natural question discussed in Chapter 4.
Problem 6 (Lupton-Oprea). What is the rational homotopy type of the sym-
plectic blow­up in the sense D. McDuff?
The results of this chapter imply the natural question about Arnold's conjec-
ture in the class of solvmanifolds. This question seems to be related to Chapter
3 since solvmanifolds can be fibered over tori with the fiber being a nilmanifold.
In this book, we have tried to indicate the wealth of possibilities inherent in
a mingling of geometry and (rational) homotopy theory. It is fitting then that
we end this exposition by expressing our hope that the material presented here
will encourage the exploration of the boundaries between these two beautiful
subjects.
