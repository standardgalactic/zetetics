Abstract
We construct a new covariant action for "ﬂat" self-dual gravity in four
spacetime dimensions. The action has just one term, but when expanded
around an appropriate background gives rise to a kinetic term and a cubic
interaction. Upon imposing the light-cone gauge, the action reproduces the
expected two-derivative chiral interaction of Siegel. The new action is in
many ways analogous to the known covariant action for self-dual Yang-Mills
theory. There is also a sense in which the new self-dual gravity action exhibits
the double copy of self-dual Yang-Mills structure.

Introduction
Self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) and self-dual gravity (SDGR) have many remark-
able properties. Both can be viewed as truncations of the YM and GR that keep
only a subset of the solutions (and also interactions) of the full theories. In the
case of SDYM these are "instantons", which are gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations whose
ﬁeld strength is purely anti-self-dual, so that the self-dual part of the curvature
2-form vanishes
퐹푎
푆퐷= 0 ,
(1.1)
Here 푎is the Lie algebra index, and the form indices are suppressed. Gauge ﬁelds
satisfying this ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation are then also automatically solutions
of the second-order YM ﬁeld equations 푑휇
퐴퐹푎
휇휈= 0, where 푑퐴is the covariant
derivative with respect to the connection 퐴. In the case of SDGR the solutions
are Einstein (i.e. having the vanishing tracefree part of the Ricci tensor) metrics
with purely anti-self-dual Weyl curvature. While this appears to be a second-
order in derivatives condition on the metric, there exists reformulations in which
the gravitational self-duality equations are ﬁrst order in derivatives, see below.
One can then see that, similar to the case of SDYM, solutions of the ﬁrst-order
self-duality equations are also automatically solutions of the second-order ﬁeld
equations of full GR.
Both SDYM and SDGR can also be studied as quantum theories. They are
both one-loop exact and quantum ﬁnite, see [1] for a discussion of this point. Both
theories can be usefully characterised (and contrasted with their full YM and GR
cousins) in terms of the scattering amplitudes that they produce. At tree level,
the only non-vanishing (for complex momenta) amplitude is at 3 particles. This
amplitude is chiral. In our conventions this is the −−+ amplitude. All higher
point amplitudes vanish at tree level. At one-loop level, all same (negative) helicity
amplitudes are non-vanishing. We refer the reader to e.g. [1] and references therein
for more information.
There exist several known formulations of SDYM and SDGR. In former case,
what appears to be the most useful covariant formulation is one ﬁrst proposed by
Chalmers and Siegel [2]. The action can be written as
푆푆퐷푌푀=
∫
Ψ푖푎퐻푖∧퐹푎.
(1.2)
Here 퐻푖, 푖= 1, 2, 3 is a triple of self-dual two-forms that are also known as ’t Hooft
symbols. These objects are dimensionless and satisfy the algebra of quaternions

The ﬁeld Ψ푖푎is a triple of Lie algebra valued scalars, and 퐹푎is the Lie algebra
valued ﬁeld strength 2-form. Note that the combination Ψ푖푎퐻푖, for varying Ψ푖푎,
parametrises a generic Lie algebra valued self-dual 2-form. Varying the action
with respect to Ψ푖푎one gets the equations 퐻푖∧퐹푎= 0, which imply (1.1). There
are other, non-covariant formulations of SDYM, some of which also feature in [2].
See also [3] for a more recent discussion, and also on how to obtain (non-covariant)
actions from the twistor space.
There exists a covariant formulation of SDGR in ﬂat space, somewhat hidden in
the discussion in [4], and discussed much more explicitly in [5]. We will review this
action below. It is considerably diﬀerent from the SDYM action (1.2). Another
action for SDGR, applicable for describing anti-self-dual Einstein metrics with
non-zero scalar curvature was studied in [1]. It is based on a "pure connection"
description of gravitational instantons, and is closer to the SDYM Chalmers-Siegel
action (1.2). The main purpose of this paper is to describe a covariant action for
SDGR that is applicable for metrics with zero scalar curvature. Thus, the theory
that is the main object of this paper can be referred to as "ﬂat" SDGR. The action
we describe is new, but is close to that in [1], and can be motivated from the latter
by a contraction procedure that drops the connection-connection term from the
ﬁeld strength. The new action is much closer to the SDYM action (1.2) than the
previously available "ﬂat" SDGR formalism [4], [5].
In its simplest form that is suitable for expanding around the ﬂat space R4 the
new action has a remarkably simple form
푆[푎, Ψ] = 1
2
∫
Ψ푖푗푑푎푖∧푑푎푗.
(1.4)
Here 푖, 푗= 1, 2, 3 and Ψ푖푗is a ﬁeld that is symmetric and tracefree Ψ푖푗훿푖푗= 0.
The action is a functional of exact two-forms 푑푎푖, and to obtain Euler-Lagrange
equations one varies with respect to both Ψ푖푗and 푎푖. In the main text we will give
a formulation that works also on arbitrary closed manifolds. In this case the exact
two-forms in the action are replaced by arbitrary closed two-forms that are varied
by exact forms.
The background that describes the ﬂat space and that gives a starting point for
the perturbative expansion is
푑푎푖= 푀2퐻푖,
(1.5)
where 퐻푖are the already encountered self-dual 2-forms, and 푀2 is the parameter
of dimension mass two, introduced for dimensional reasons. As will be further
discussed below, a triple of 2-forms 퐻푖(that is suitably non-degenerate) uniquely
2

determines a conformal class of a metric for which 퐻푖are self-dual. Then, the
volume form is ﬁxed as a multiple of 훿푖푗퐻푖∧퐻푗. Therefore, 퐻푖determines a
unique metric, and this is how the ﬁelds contained in the action (1.4) determine
the metric. The action (1.4) expanded around this background then reads
푆SDGR =
∫
Ψ푖푗

푀2퐻푖∧푑푎푗+ 1
2푑푎푖∧푑푎푗
.
(1.6)
The ﬁrst term can be shown, see below, to give the correct action for free gravitons,
and the second term is a simple cubic vertex. It is instructive to compare this to
the SDYM action (1.2) that we write in the form that exhibits strongest similarity
to (1.6)
푆SDYM =
∫
Ψ푖푎

퐻푖∧푑퐴푎+ 1
2 푓푎푏푐퐻푖∧퐴푏∧퐴푐
.
(1.7)
Here 퐴푎is a one-form connection taking values in a Lie algebra with structure
constants 푓푎푏푐. The new SDGR action thus exhibits the double copy structure
[6] of gravity rather explicitly. Indeed, this is particularly prominent in the ﬁrst,
kinetic terms of both actions. It is clear that one passes from SDYM to SDGR by
replacing the Lie algebra index in Ψ푖푎, 퐴푎by the "gravitational" index 푖. This is
precisely what the double copy procedure is supposed to do, replacing "colour" by
"kinematics". It is this similarity between the SDYM and the new SDGR action
that is, in our opinion, one of the most attractive features of the new formulation.
In the main text we will see that the similarity between the two theories extends
further and SDYM and SDGR in the form (1.4 are similar in many aspects.
We will also show that in the light-cone gauge the new action reduces to the
well-known Siegel action [4]
푆=

(Φ−2□Φ+2 + 푀푃푙휖퐴′퐵′휖퐶′퐷′Φ+2휕+퐴′휕+퐶′Φ−2휕+퐵′휕+퐷′Φ−2) ,
(1.8)
where Φ±2 are two scalars representing helicity ±2 states of the graviton.
A part of our motivation in this paper stems from the study of Chiral Higher
Spin Gravity [7–11], which is the minimal extension of gravity by massless higher
spin ﬁelds. Its action contains the SDYM and SDGR actions that are coupled to
higher spin ﬁelds featuring their own interactions too. The theory is UV-ﬁnite
at one-loop despite the naive non-renormalizability of higher derivative higher
spin interactions [10–12] and captures a subset of correlation functions of Chern-
Simons matter theories [13] via AdS/CFT. The action (1.4) arose as a by product
3

of [14], where covariant actions featuring gauge and gravitational interactions of
higher spin ﬁelds were constructed. But these higher spin considerations will not
play any role in this paper. We motivate and introduce the action (1.4) staying
ﬁrmly in the context of usual gravity and its self-dual truncation.
The outline of the paper is as follows.
In section 2 we present the new
formulation of the SDGR in ﬂat space and discuss its relation to mathematical
results and to other formulations. In section 3 we discuss the perturbative aspects
such as gauge-ﬁxing, amplitudes and the light-cone gauge. Finally, in section 4
we identify the gauge algebra behind ﬂat SDGR, which turns out to be a certain
contraction of 푠표(3, 2) that is diﬀerent from the Poincare algebra.

Self-Dual Gravity
The discussion of this section is phrased in terms of Euclidean signature gravity.
Indeed, anti-self-dual Einstein metrics are only non-trivial (i.e. not maximally
symmetric) when the signature is Euclidean or split. Alternatively, one can inter-
pret the constructions below as those for complexiﬁed GR.
2.1
Hyper-Kähler manifolds
It is well-known that a zero scalar curvature four-dimensional gravitational in-
stanton is a hyper-Kähler manifold. We recall that a hyper-Kähler manifold of
dimension 4푘is an Einstein manifold that is Kähler with respect to 3 diﬀerent
complex structures 퐼, 퐽, 퐾that anti-commute and form the algebra of imaginary
quaternions 퐼퐽= 퐾. This means that the manifold has a quaternionic structure,
which in turn implies that the holonomy is contained in Sp(푘) and the manifold
has zero scalar curvature. In the case 푘= 1 we have Sp(1) = SU(2) and a hyper-
Kähler manifold is a complex 2-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. Any compact
such manifold is either a 퐾3 surface or a torus 푇4.
Given that the holonomy of a 4-dimensional hyper-Kähler manifold is con-
tained in one of the two chiral halves SU(2) of the 4-dimensional rotation group
SO(4), it is always possible to choose a gauge in which the chiral half of the spin
connection for the other SU(2) vanishes. This gives a very convenient starting
point for describing such manifolds. In the mathematical literature such a de-
scription is well known. It has been sketched in [15] and described in details in
[16].
We start by describing the result that appears as Lemma 3.1 in [16].
4

Lemma 1. Let 푋be a 4-manifold and (휔1, 휔2, 휔3) a triple of closed 2-forms on
푋that satisfy
휔푖∧휔푗= 2훿푖푗휇,
(2.1)
where 휇is some non-vanishing 4-form on 푋. Then 푋carries a hyper-Kähler
metric, which is characterised by the fact that all 휔푖are self-dual and the volume
form is 휇.
The proof is based on several steps, see [16], and we just sketch the main
points. Given a triple of non-degenerate 2-forms 휔푖on 푋there exists a unique
conformal class of a metric on 푋which makes 휔푖self-dual. If the wedge product
on the subbundle in Λ2 spanned by 휔푖is deﬁnite, then the conformal metric one
obtains is of a Riemannian signature. Choosing a volume form one then gets a
metric. In the case of 2-forms satisfying (2.1) the natural volume form to complete
the deﬁnition of the metric is 휇. Overall, with (2.1) satisﬁed we get a Riemannian
signature metric 푔휔deﬁned by 휔푖.
The second important statement is that when the 2-forms are closed 푑휔푖=
0, and satisfy (2.1), the self-dual part of the spin connection vanishes.
This
immediately implies that 푔휔is Einstein of zero scalar curvature, and with only a
half of its Weyl curvature possibly non-zero. Indeed, the fact that the self-dual
part of the spin connection is zero implies that also its curvature 2-form is zero.
However, as is well-known, see e.g. [17], Chapter 5, the curvature of only one
of the two chiral halves of the spin connection contains enough information to
impose the Einstein condition. Thus, in general, the curvature of the self-dual
part of the spin connection can be decomposed into its self- and anti-self-dual
parts (as a 2-form). The self-dual part then encodes one of the two chiral halves
of the Weyl curvature, as well as the scalar curvature. The anti-self-dual part
encodes the tracefree part of Ricci. When both these parts vanish we have a zero
scalar curvature Einstein manifold, whose self-dual part of the Weyl curvature also
vanishes. This is a gravitational instanton.
We can then propose a variational principle that leads to (2.1) as one of the
Euler-Lagrange equations. The action we take is
푆[Ψ, 휔] = 1
2
∫
Ψ푖푗휔푖∧휔푗.
(2.2)
Here Ψ푖푗is a ﬁeld that is symmetric Ψ푖푗= Ψ(푖푗), which is moreover assumed to
be tracefree 훿푖푗Ψ푖푗= 0. Varying the action with respect to this ﬁeld produces the
condition (2.1).
5

The action (2.2) can also be varied with respect to 휔푖. It should be kept in
mind, however, that the 2-forms 휔푖are not free to vary, as they are assumed to be
closed. This means that it is natural to allow only a variation of each one of them
by an exact form. Thus, the deﬁnition of the action is completed by requiring that
the variations in the space of 2-forms are by an exact form
훿휔푖= 푑푎푖.
(2.3)
This is similar to the variational principles considered by Hitchin in [18]. With
this in mind, the Euler-Lagrange equation arising by varying 휔푖are
푑Ψ푖푗∧휔푗= 0 ,
(2.4)
where we used the fact that 휔푖are closed. This equation describes a propagation
of the ﬁeld Ψ푖푗in the background of the gravitational instanton described by 휔푖.
The action (2.2) is invariant under diﬀeomorphisms
훿휔푖= L휂휔푖,
훿Ψ푖푗= L휂Ψ푖푗,
(2.5)
where 휂≡휂휇and L휂= {푑, 푖휂} is the Lie derivative. Also, if one decides to
parametrise 2-forms 휔푖in a given cohomology class, then the variation in each
cohomology class is an exact form 푑푎푖. It is clear that the 1-forms 푎푖are deﬁned
modulo exact forms 푑휃푖, where 휃푖are zero-forms.
2.2
Relation to SDGR on anti-de Sitter space.
There is another covariant action for SDGR [1], which is better suited for expansion
over (anti-) de Sitter space. The ﬂat action we described above can be understood
as arising by a "contraction" procedure from the action [1].
Action [1] has a related ﬁeld content and reads
푆[Ψ, 퐴] = 1
2
∫
Ψ푖푗퐹푖∧퐹푗.
(2.6)
The action is a functional of the "Lagrange multiplier" ﬁeld Ψ푖푗, which is the
same ﬁeld that appears in (2.2), and an SO(3) connection 퐴푖. The object 퐹푖is the
curvature 2-form
퐹푖= 푑퐴푖+ 1
2휖푖푗푘퐴푗∧퐴푘.
(2.7)
6

The symmetries of this theory are the local SO(3) symmetries and diﬀeomor-
phisms.
The action (2.6) describes anti-self-dual Einstein metrics with non-zero scalar
curvature. The logic that leads to this conclusion is very similar to that described
in the previous subsection. Thus, the equation one obtains by varying with respect
to Ψ푖푗is
퐹푖∧퐹푗= 2훿푖푗휇.
(2.8)
Similar to the ﬂat case, in which the role of 퐹푖is played by the symplectic forms
휔푖, the triple 퐹푖of curvature 2-forms can be used to deﬁne a Riemannian signature
metric 푔퐹. It has the unique conformal class that makes the 2-forms 퐹푖self-dual,
and it has the volume form 휇. The second step is also similar to one we had in
the ﬂat case. When (2.8) are satisﬁed, the Bianchi identity 푑퐴퐹푖= 0 implies that
the connection 퐴푖is the self-dual part of the spin connection for the metric 푔퐹.
However, unlike in the ﬂat case, this connection no longer needs to vanish. Instead,
its curvature, which coincides with the self-dual part of the Riemann curvature,
is in an appropriate sense constant, which means that only the scalar curvature,
and possibly the anti-self-dual part of the Weyl curvature is non-vanishing. This
means that the metric 푔퐹is a gravitational instanton. For more details on this
construction we refer the reader to [1] and also to [17].
It is now clear that we can obtain the action (2.2) from (2.6) by a contraction
procedure that sets to zero the 퐴퐴terms in (2.6). After this the curvature 2-forms
퐹푖are exact forms 퐹푖= 푑퐴푖≡푑푎푖, and the action coincides with (2.2) restricted
to the situation of "exact" 2-forms 휔푖. It is clear, however, that the action (2.2)
where 휔푖do not need to be exact, is more general and makes sense also on closed
4-manifolds.
2.3
Relation between diﬀerent formulations of (SD)GR.
All action discussed above have a direct relation to the action of General Relativity
proposed by Plebanski [19]. This action reads
푆[퐻, 퐴, Ψ] =
∫
퐻푖퐹푖−1
2

Ψ푖푗+ Λ
3 훿푖푗

퐻푖퐻푗.
(2.9)
Here 퐻푖is a triple of 2-forms, and 퐴푖is an SO(3) gauge ﬁeld. As before Ψ푖푗are
"Lagrange multiplier" ﬁelds. The equation for 퐻푖is
퐹푖=

Ψ푖푗+ Λ
3 훿푖푗

퐻푗.
(2.10)
7

Plebanski action can be used to obtain an alternative description of GR in
which only the ﬁelds Ψ푖푗and 퐴푖remain. This is done by solving the equation
(2.10) for the 2-form ﬁelds 퐻푖. This gives
퐻푖=

Ψ + Λ
3 1
−1
푖푗
퐹푗.
(2.11)
Substituting this into the original action gives
푆= 1
2
∫
퐹푖퐹푗(Ψ + Λ1)−1
푖푗.
(2.12)
This action is still equivalent to the full Einstein-Hilbert action with a non-zero
cosmological constant. The truncation to SDGR corresponds to an expansion of
the matrix (Ψ + Λ1)−1 in powers of Ψ, and then dropping all terms apart from
푆= 1
2
∫
퐹푖퐹푗Ψ푖푗.
(2.13)
If one further drops the 퐴퐴term in the curvature one obtains the "ﬂat" SDGR
action (2.2) that is the subject of this paper.
There is another action for ﬂat SDGR, which is due to Siegel [4]. It is obtained
by dropping the cosmological constant term, as well as the 퐴퐴term from the
curvature. In order to distinguish the new ﬁeld, which is no longer a connection,
from 퐴푖, we change the name to 푎푖. The action is then
푆[퐻, 퐴] =
∫
퐻푖푑푎푖−1
2Ψ푖푗퐻푖퐻푗.
(2.14)
The action in [4] is a diﬀerent, but a closely related one. To see this, we ﬁrst
note that the purpose of the last term containing Ψ푖푗is to impose the constraint
that implies that 퐻푖is the self-dual part of the 2-form constructed from the frame.
Thus, (2.14) is equivalent to an action for the frame ﬁeld and a triple of 1-forms
푆[푒, 퐴] =
∫
(푒∧푒)푖
푆퐷푑푎푖.
(2.15)
Here (푒∧푒)푖
푆퐷is the triple of self-dual 2-forms constructed from the frame 푒. As
is explained in [5], the variation of this action with respect to 푎푖gives an equation
that implies that the self-dual part of the spin connection vanishes, which thus
gives the correct description of gravitational instantons.
8

The diﬀerence between (2.14), (2.15) and (2.2) is in a diﬀerent ﬁeld content
that is used to obtain the equation that guarantees that the self-dual part of the spin
connection vanishes. In (2.14), (2.15) we have a metric-like ﬁeld 퐻푖or a frame 푒,
and the main equation that arises is a ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equation on this
metric-like ﬁeld. The action (2.2) gives a "connection" description of gravitational
instantons, in which the metric is constructed from the derivative 휔푖= 푑푎푖of
the connection-like ﬁeld 푎푖. The main arising equation in this formalism is the
algebraic equation (2.1) for the objects 휔푖= 푑푎푖.
The advantage of the formulation (2.2) as compared to (2.15) is that the covari-
ant form of gauge-ﬁxing that is necessary to do covariant perturbative calculations
is much simpler for (2.2) than for (2.15). For the latter, the gauge-ﬁxing is quite
non-trivial and was recently described in [20]. This reference contains the de-
scription relevant for full GR. The case of SDGR is obtained by a truncation.
Nevertheless, even in the truncated case the gauge-ﬁxing remains quite involved.
In contrast, there is a much simpler covariant gauge-ﬁxing that is available for the
action (2.2). This will be described below. This, together with the strong similar-
ity to the known SDYM action (1.2) that we already discussed in the Introduction
suggests that the action (2.2) is more useful for explicit calculations than (2.15).
3
Perturbative expansion, amplitudes, light-cone
We now consider the action (2.2) in the form (1.4) that is appropriate for expan-
sion around the ﬂat space background. The gauge symmetries of this action are
diﬀeomorphisms as well as shifts of the 1-form potentials 푎푖by exact 1-forms.
Together, these can be described as follows
훿푎푖= 푑휉푖+ 푖휂퐻푖+ 푖휂푑푎푖,
훿Ψ푖푗= 푖휂푑Ψ푖푗,
(3.1)
where we used L휂= {푑, 푖휂} and absorbed 푑(푖휂휔푖) into 휉푖. This gives the most
convenient representation of the gauge symmetries, because in this form there
are no derivatives of the vector ﬁelds 휂휇. The diﬀeomorphisms then act purely
algebraically on the ﬁelds, which greatly simpliﬁes the gauge-ﬁxing, see below.
3.1
Free ﬁelds and the spinor notation
We have already quoted the perturbative expansion of the action (2.2) around the
ﬂat space background in (1.6).
The background corresponds to the choice of
the basic 2-forms 휔푖being equal to the ’t Hooft symbols 퐻푖. To understand the
9

structure of the ﬁrst, kinetic term of the action (1.6) it is very useful to pass to the
spinor notation.
The spinor translation of the ﬁelds Ψ푖푗, 푎푖is as follows. The object 푎푖
휇becomes
푎퐴퐵
휇, which is a one-form with values in symmetric rank two spinors. Indices
휇, 휈, ... = 0, ..., 3 are world indices; 퐴, 퐵, 퐶, ... = 1, 2 and 퐴′, 퐵′, ... = 1, 2 are
the spinor indices of the Lorentz algebra 푠푙(2, C). Translating into spinor indices
also the spacetime (1-form) index 휇we get an object 푎퐴퐵퐶퐶′, where now we
have two diﬀerent types of spinor indices. The tracefree ﬁeld Ψ푖푗translates into
the totally symmetric rank 4 spinor Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷. The spinor notation for the partial
derivative is 휕퐴퐴′. The exterior derivative 푑푎푖becomes the following spinorial
object 휕퐶퐶′푎퐴퐵퐷퐷′. The ﬁrst, kinetic term in (1.6) involves taking the wedge
product of this with self-dual 2-forms 퐻푖. This causes the self-dual projection of the
object 휕퐶퐶′푎퐴퐵퐷퐷′, because self-dual forms only pair non-trivially with self-dual
one under the wedge product. The self-dual projection of the 2-form 휕퐶퐶′푎퐴퐵퐷퐷′
is the object 휕퐶퐶′푎퐴퐵퐷퐶′ in which the primed spinor index is contracted. All in
all, the spinor translation of the kinetic term in (1.6) reads
푆(2)[Ψ, 푎] =
∫
Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷휕퐴퐴′푎퐵퐶퐷퐴′ .
(3.2)
We have rescaled the ﬁeld Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷to absorb the dimensionful quantity 푀2 into it,
so as to get the canonically normalised kinetic term. This means that the potential
ﬁeld 푎has mass dimension one, while Ψ has mass dimension two.
We now introduce a very convenient notation. To save indices, from now on,
the indices that belong to a group of symmetric (or to be symmetrized) indices can
be denoted by the same letter. The kinetic term written in this notation reads
푆=
∫
Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴휕퐴퐴′푎퐴퐴퐴퐴′ .
(3.3)
The corresponding equations of motion are
휕퐵퐴′ Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐵= 0 ,
휕퐴퐵′ 푎퐴퐴퐴,퐵′ = 0 .
(3.4)
These equations are well-known [21–24]. They describe the helicity +2 and −2
states of the free graviton. The ﬁrst one is just a part of the Bianchi identities
for the Weyl tensor. As expected, we have the correct free limit where the theory
describes free massless spin-two degrees of freedom.

3.2
Gauge-ﬁxing
The gauge symmetries (3.1) linearized around the ﬂat background are
훿푎퐴퐵= 푑휉퐴퐵+ 휂퐴퐵′ 푒퐵퐵′
훿Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴= 0 .
(3.5)
Here 푒퐴퐴′ is the background vierbein 1-form, and the last piece in the gauge trans-
formation for the potential ﬁelds 푎푖originates from 푖휂퐻퐴퐵, where we converted
vector-ﬁeld 휂휇into a bi-spinor 휂퐴퐴′ = 푒퐴퐴′
휇
휂휇with the help of background vierbein
푒퐴퐴′
휇
. Now, 푎퐴퐵can be decomposed into two irreducible spin-tensors:
푎퐴퐵= 푒퐶퐶′Φ퐴퐵퐶,퐶′ + 푒퐴퐵′ Φ퐵퐵′
(3.6)
of type (3, 1) and (1, 1), respectively. It is clear that 휂-symmetry allows us to
gauge away the second component in a peaceful algebraic way. As the result we
have a theory of two irreducible spin-tensors, Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷and Φ퐴퐵퐶,퐴′, as the physical
ﬁelds and with the following linearised gauge transformations
훿Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐴′ = 휕퐴퐴′휉퐴퐴,
훿Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴= 0 ,
(3.7)
where we used our convention that a set of spinor indices that is symmetrised is
denoted by the same letter.
The linearised action (3.3) does not depend on the Φ퐵퐵′ component of the con-
nection, and in this sense already has the diﬀeomorphism symmetry gauge-ﬁxed.
There is still the symmetry 훿Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐴′ = 휕퐴퐴′휉퐴퐴that this action is invariant under.
To gauge-ﬁx it, and produce a kinetic term that can be inverted to obtain the prop-
agator, we use a variant of the Lorentz gauge. The same gauge-ﬁxing procedure
but for the SDGR with non-zero cosmological constant has been described in [1].
The idea is to add a Lagrange multiplier term imposing the Lorentz gauge
condition
휕퐵퐵′Φ퐴퐴퐵,퐵′ = 0 .
(3.8)
This is added with a Lagrange multiplier Ψ퐴퐴. One then notices that the ﬁeld
Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴already present in the action can be combined with the new Lagrange
multiplier ﬁeld Ψ퐴퐴to produce the new ﬁeld
˜Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷:= Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷+ Ψ(퐴퐵휖퐶)퐷.
(3.9)
The new ﬁeld is totally symmetric in its ﬁrst 3 spinor indices, and consists of two
diﬀerent irreducible components Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷and Ψ퐴퐵. Returning to the convention of
11

a repeated spinor index to denote a group of spinor indices that is totally symmetric,
the gauge-ﬁxed action becomes
∫
˜Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐵휕퐵퐵′ Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐵′ .
(3.10)
This action depends on two ﬁelds Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐵′ and ˜Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐵that both contain the same
number of components. The operator that maps one into the other is a version of
the (chiral) Dirac operator, and is non-degenerate. Its inverse is the propagator of
the theory.
3.3
Tree-level amplitudes
Polarisation spinors
We start by discussing the momentum space representation
of the solutionsof the linearised ﬁeld equations (3.4). It is clear that these equations
describe the two helicities of the graviton asymmetrically. One of the two helicities
resides in the "potential" ﬁeld Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐵′, while the other helicity resides in Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴.
Let us agree that it is the negative helicity that is described by the connection. The
corresponding polarisation tensor is then
휖−
퐴퐴퐴,퐴′(푘) = 푀푞퐴푞퐴푞퐴푘퐴′
(푞푘)3
.
(3.11)
Here we have a null momentum 푘퐴퐴′ = 푘퐴푘퐴′, 푞퐴is an auxiliary spinor, and
(푞푘) := 푞퐴푘퐴is the spinor contraction. We have also included a dimensionful
parameter 푀to an appropriate power in front, so that the polarisation spinor is
dimensionless. Thepolarisation spinorintroduced satisﬁes theﬁrst oftheequations
in (3.4).
The polarisation spinor describing the opposite, positive helicity is an object
with only unprimed spinor indices and is given by
휖+
퐴퐴퐴퐴= 푀−1푘퐴푘퐴푘퐴푘퐴.
(3.12)
The mass parameter in front is so that the mass dimension of this spinor is one.
This polarisation spinor satisﬁes the momentum space version of the second of the
equations in (3.4).
Amplitude characterisation of the cubic vertex
We now evaluate the cubic
vertex in (1.6) on shell, by inserting into it appropriate polarisation spinors. Given
12

that we have absorbed the mass parameter 푀2 into Ψ to give it the mass dimension
two, the interaction takes the form
1
2푀2
∫
Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴푑푎퐴퐴∧푑푎퐴퐴.
(3.13)
On negative helicity states 휖−(푘) the 2-forms 푑푎퐴퐴have only the ASD parts,
because their SD parts vanish in view of the equation satisﬁed by these states. So,
the only non-vanishing part of 푑푎퐴퐴is the spinor
푀푞퐴푞퐴
(푞푘)2 푘퐴′푘퐵′ .
(3.14)
Note that, apart from the dimensionful prefactor, this is the usual polarisation state
for a single negative helicity graviton.
The cubic interaction in (1.6) contains the wedge product of two such 푑푎
factors. This converts into the contraction of the primed indices, which gives
푀2[12]2 푞퐴푞퐴푞퐴푞퐴
(푞1)2(푞2)2 .
(3.15)
We now contract this with a positive helicity polarisation spinor (3.12), and mul-
tiply the result by 푀−2 present in front of the action. The amplitude is then given
by
A−−+ = 1
푀[12]2
(푞3)4
(푞1)2(푞2)2 .
(3.16)
Eliminating factors of the auxiliary spinor 푞using the momentum conservation
identities (푞3)/(푞1) = −[12]/[32], (푞3)/(푞2) = −[21]/[31] we get
A−−+ = 1
푀
[12]6
[23]2[13]2 .
(3.17)
This is the usual result in gravity. This also allows us to identify 푀= 푀푃푙.
3.4
Light-cone gauge
Another very useful characterisation of the theory can be obtained by passing into
the light-cone gauge. This reduces everything to the physical degrees of freedom
only. Light-cone gauge also allows to perform explicit computations of Feynman
diagrams since SDGR turns out to be a rather simple theory of two ’scalar’ ﬁelds
representing helicity ±2 states.
13

As the ﬁrst step we impose the light-cone gauge by setting Φ퐴퐵+,+′ = 0.2
Then, the physical degree of freedom is in Φ−2 = (휕++′)−2Φ−−−,+′ and Φ−−−,−′ =
휕+−′(휕++′)−1Φ−−−,+′ is an auxiliary ﬁeld. As for Ψ퐴퐵퐶퐷, the physical degree of
freedom resides in Φ+2 = (휕++′)2Ψ−−−−, the rest being auxiliary ﬁelds. Plugging
this into the full action we end up with the Siegel action [4]
푆=
∫
(Φ−2□Φ+2 + 푀푃푙휖퐴′퐵′휖퐶′퐷′Φ+2휕+퐴′휕+퐶′Φ−2휕+퐵′휕+퐷′Φ−2) ,
(3.18)
where we also introduced a coupling constant 푔. We note that Φ±2 are related
via 휙±푠= (휕++′)∓2Φ±푠to the ﬁelds 휙±푠that transform canonically under the
Lorentz transformations, see e.g. [7, 25] and [4] for more detail on light-cone
manipulations.

Gauge algebra of SDGR
It is also interesting to discuss the gauge algebra of SDGR in ﬂat and anti-de Sitter
space. Let us start with the Lorentz 퐿퐴퐴, 퐿퐴′퐴′ and translations 푃퐴퐴′ generators
of the anti-de Sitter algebra 푠표(3, 2) ∼푠푝(4, R):
[퐿퐴퐵, 푃퐶퐶′] = 휖퐵퐶푃퐴퐶′ + 휖퐴퐶푃퐵퐶′ ,
(4.1a)
[퐿퐴′퐵′, 푃퐶퐶′] = 휖퐵′퐶′푃퐶퐴′ + 휖퐴′퐶′푃퐶퐵′ ,
(4.1b)
[푃퐴퐴′, 푃퐵퐵′] = 휖퐴′퐵′퐿퐴퐵+ 휖퐴퐵퐿퐴′퐵′ ,
(4.1c)
[퐿퐴퐵, 퐿퐶퐷] = 휖퐵퐶퐿퐴퐷+ 3 more ,
(4.1d)
[퐿퐴′퐵′, 퐿퐶′퐷′] = 휖퐵′퐶′퐿퐴′퐷′ + 3 more .
(4.1e)
Introducing a gauge ﬁeld of this algebra, 퐴= 1
2휔퐴퐴퐿퐴퐴+ 1
2휔퐴′퐴′퐿퐴′퐴′ +푒퐴퐴′푃퐴퐴′
the curvature 퐹(퐴) of 퐴decomposes into
푑휔퐴퐴+ 휔퐴퐶∧휔퐶퐵+ 푒퐴퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′ = 푅퐴퐴,
(4.2a)
푑푒퐴퐴′ + 휔퐴′
퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′ + 휔퐴퐵∧푒퐵퐴′ = 푇퐴퐴′ ,
(4.2b)
푑휔퐴′퐴′ + 휔퐴′
퐶′ ∧휔퐶′퐵′ + 푒퐵퐴′ ∧푒퐵퐴′ = 푅퐴′퐴′ ,
(4.2c)
the second one being torsion and the other two being two components of the
curvature two-form. The ﬁrst curvature is the one that is used in the AdS-SDGR
2We change the range of indices from 1, 2 to 퐴= +, −, 퐴′ = +′, −′, etc.
14

with 푅퐴퐵= 퐹퐴퐵+ 푒퐴퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′. The Ψ-equations of motion guarantee that 퐹퐴퐴
can be expressed as 푒퐴퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′.
In order to reproduce the structures relevant for the ﬂat space SDGR, we can
take a limit where 퐿퐴퐴becomes central and 퐿퐴′퐴′ disappears from [푃, 푃], i.e.
[퐿퐴퐵, 푃퐶퐶′] = 0 ,
(4.3a)
[퐿퐴′퐵′, 푃퐶퐶′] = 휖퐵′퐶′푃퐶퐴′ + 휖퐴′퐶′푃퐶퐵′ ,
(4.3b)
[푃퐴퐴′, 푃퐵퐵′] = 휖퐴′퐵′퐿퐴퐵,
(4.3c)
[퐿퐴퐵, 퐿퐶퐷] = 0 ,
(4.3d)
[퐿퐴′퐵′, 퐿퐶′퐷′] = 휖퐵′퐶′퐿퐴′퐷′ + 3 more .
(4.3e)
Note that this limit is rather diﬀerent from the ﬂat space limit where the only
change as compared to (4.1) is
[푃퐴퐴′, 푃퐵퐵′] = 0 .
(4.4)
The limiting algebra (4.3) takes advantage of the speciﬁc structure that is available
only in 4푑: there are chiral 퐿퐴퐴and anti-chiral 퐿퐴′퐴′ generators and we can treat
them diﬀerently. The curvatures corresponding to (4.3) are
푑휔퐴퐴+ 푒퐴퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′ = 푃퐴퐴,
(4.5a)
푑푒퐴퐴′ + 휔퐴′
퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′ = 푇퐴퐴′ ,
(4.5b)
푑휔퐴′퐴′ + 휔퐴′
퐶′ ∧휔퐶′퐵′ = 푃퐴′퐴′ .
(4.5c)
Our action takes advantage of 푃퐴퐴= 퐹퐴퐴+ 푒퐴퐵′ ∧푒퐴퐵′ only.
Let us discuss the relation to the well-known oscillator realisation of 푠표(5) ∼
푠푝(4). One takes four operators with canonical commutation relations, [푦퐴, 푦퐵] =
푖휖퐴퐵, [ ¯푦퐴′, ¯푦퐵′] = 푖휖퐴′퐵′ and deﬁnes
퐿퐴퐵= −푖
2 {푦퐴, 푦퐵} ,
퐿퐴′퐵′ = −푖
2 { ¯푦퐴′, ¯푦퐵′} ,
푃퐴퐴′ = −푖
2 {푦퐴, ¯푦퐴′} .
(4.6)
These generators obey (4.1). The limiting algebra (4.3) can be obtained in the
commutative limit [푦퐴, 푦퐵] = 0, while leaving [ ¯푦퐴′, ¯푦퐵′] = 푖휖퐴′퐵′ untouched.
The construction above has an obvious higher spin generalization. In the higher
spin case the gauge algebra is the even subalgebra of the Weyl algebra 퐴2 [26],
i.e. its elements are even functions 푓(푦, ¯푦) = 푓(−푦, −¯푦). Similarly to SDGR,
the limiting algebra is the commutative limit in 푦퐴. Despite being commutative
the algebra still features a certain deformation to 퐴∞- and 퐿∞-algebras described
in [27] (the deformation is due to a Z2-orbifold: Poisson manifolds with discrete
symmetries can have more deformations in the sense of deformation quantization
provided one considers the corresponding Poisson orbifold).

Discussion
In this paper we have given a new simple action formulation of self-dual gravity that
is appropriate for describing gravitational instantons with zero scalar curvature.
Many elements of this description can be found in the mathematical literature
[15],[16], but the action (2.2) appears to be new.
We have seen that the action (2.2), when expanded around an appropriate
background 휔푖= 퐻푖, gives rise to the kinetic term (3.3). The corresponding
linearised ﬁeld equations describe two diﬀerent graviton helicities, one contained
in the ﬁeld Φ퐴퐴퐴,퐵′ and the other in Ψ퐴퐴퐴퐴. We have also seen that the arising
interaction, which is of the form Ψ푑푎푑푎, correctly reproduces the 3 point graviton
scattering amplitude (3.17). The action (2.2) also gives rise to the familiar pattern
(3.18) in the light-cone gauge.
One of the most intriguing aspects of the new formulation of SDGR is that the
structure of the arising kinetic term (3.3) literally mimics the structure familiar
from the SDYM case. Indeed, as discussed in details in [1], the spinor translation
of the ﬁrst, kinetic term in (1.7) is given by Ψ퐴퐵휕퐵퐵′퐴퐴퐵′. We thus see that the
change in the case of gravity is to add two more unprimed spinor indices. The
gauge-ﬁxing that is most useful in the case of SDYM, see [1], is also the complete
analog of the one in (3.9). Thus, the kinetic terms of SDGR and SDYM can be
treated in exact parallel, and the arising propagator is the inverse of an appropriate
chiral Dirac operator.
It is interesting that this suggests a new perspective on the colour/kinematics
duality and the double copy structure [6] of gravity. Indeed, the double copy
prescription is to ﬁrst write the YM amplitudes so that the colour/kinematic sym-
metry is manifest. The second step is to replace the "colour" numerators with
the "kinematic" ones. It is interesting that one can pass from the kinetic term of
SDYM in (1.7) to the kinetic term of SDGR in (1.6) simply by replacing the Lie
algebra "colour" index of Ψ푖푎, 퐴푎with the "chiral" index 푖= 1, 2, 3 that enumerates
the generators of the self-dual chiral half of the Lorentz Lie algebra. This suggests
that there is a link between the chiral half of the Lorentz algebra and the myste-
rious "kinematics" Lie algebra whose existence is suggested by the statement of
the colour/kinematics duality, see [28] for an attempt at identiﬁcation of this Lie
algebra. It would be very interesting to see if the new formulation of SDGR can
shed any light on the double copy structure of gravity, even if only in the self-dual
sector. We hope to return to this question in another publication.
