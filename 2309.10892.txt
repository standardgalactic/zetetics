1. Introduction 
The landscape of higher education is experiencing a significant transformation, propelled by 
rapid advancements in digital technology and the evolving needs of a diverse and globally 
distributed student population (Altbach et al., 2009). Traditional teaching methods, while 
effective in many contexts, often struggle to provide personalized support and instant feedback, 
particularly in fields that demand a significant amount of text-based learning, critical thinking, 
and analytical skills (Means et al., 2009). These fields, such as Creativity and Critical Analysis, 
and Society and Culture, can pose challenges for students to master without adequate support 
(Holmes et al., 2019). This has led to a growing interest in exploring innovative solutions that 

 
can enhance the learning experience and outcomes for students in these fields, and beyond 
(Popenici and Kerr, 2017). 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have emerged as 
promising technologies with the potential to revolutionize the educational landscape. NLP and 
knowledge generation systems have been used actively for communicating data and information 
(Baydaroglu et al., 2023) in environmental (Sermet & Demir, 2018) and health (Zhang et al., 
2023; Sermet & Demir, 2021) domains. The advent of AI-enabled tools, such as virtual teaching 
assistants (VTAs), offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between traditional teaching 
practices and the evolving needs of students (Winkler & Söllner, 2018). VTAs can provide 
personalized support, instant feedback, and adaptive learning experiences, thereby enhancing 
student engagement, satisfaction, and learning outcomes (Fryer et al., 2017). 
Moreover, these AI-enabled solutions are not limited to text-based materials. Advanced deep 
learning models have been successfully used for synthetic image generation (Gautam et al., 
2022), image data augmentation (Demiray et al., 2021) and image analysis (Li & Demir, 2023). 
They can also support learning in areas such as coding, mathematics and statistics, and even 
visual inputs. By leveraging AI and NLP, VTAs can interpret and provide feedback on code 
snippets, mathematical equations, and statistical models. They can also process and respond to 
visual inputs such as diagrams, charts, images, videos, and maps, further expanding their utility 
in diverse learning contexts. 
Web technologies play a crucial role in embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) and 
chatbots into the intricate fabric of modern engineering education, catering to a myriad of 
specialized domains. In the realm of advanced modeling (Ewing et al., 2022) and analysis tools 
(Sit et al., 2021), web platforms enable real-time processing and intuitive visualization of 
complex engineering problems, enhancing students' ability to grasp and manipulate sophisticated 
models. When diving into the vast sea of programming libraries, as documented by Ramirez et 
al. (2022; 2023), web technologies make it feasible to offer on-the-spot guidance, code 
suggestions, and troubleshooting advice, assisting budding engineers in seamlessly navigating 
and utilizing these libraries.  
Furthermore, the convergence of LLMs, chatbots, and web platforms has been instrumental 
in redefining pedagogical methods. Here, web-hosted chatbots, powered by LLMs, can simulate 
ethical dilemmas, guide reflections, and provide instant feedback, ensuring that future engineers 
not only excel in their technical prowess but also uphold the ethical standards of their profession. 
However, the effectiveness of VTAs in supporting students' learning needs in these diverse 
fields, where multi-modal data plays a significant role, remains an area ripe for exploration. The 
potential of VTAs to enhance learning outcomes across a wide range of disciplines and learning 
formats underscores the need for further research and development in this growing field. 
This study introduces a novel web-based framework for an AI-enabled Virtual Teaching 
Assistant (AIIA), designed to enhance student learning in qualitative disciplines. The AIIA, built 
with a NodeJS backend, leverages the power of AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to 
create an interactive and engaging platform. This platform is engineered to reduce the cognitive 

 
load on learners by providing easy access to information and facilitating knowledge assessment. 
The AIIA's capabilities include understanding and responding to student inquiries, generating 
quizzes and flashcards, and delivering personalized learning support tailored to individual needs 
and learning styles. By presenting this innovative framework, this paper contributes to the 
ongoing efforts to integrate AI-enabled technologies and web systems into education, aiming to 
improve the effectiveness of learning support in qualitative fields. 
The potential impact of this research is significant, as it can provide valuable insights into the 
design, implementation, and evaluation of AI-enabled VTAs in higher education. The findings of 
this study can inform the development of innovative educational tools that can enhance student 
learning outcomes, engagement, and satisfaction. Furthermore, the research can contribute to the 
broader discourse on the integration of AI and NLP in education, providing empirical evidence 
on the effectiveness of these technologies in enhancing teaching and learning practices. 
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the relevant 
literature and identifies the knowledge gap. Section 3 presents the methodology of the design 
choices, development and implementation of a course-oriented intelligent assistance system. 
Section 4 describes the features implemented for both the instructors and students. Section 5 
discusses the strengths, limitations, and future directions. Section 6 concludes the articles with a 
summary of contributions. 
 
2. Related Work 
The literature on the application of AI in education has grown substantially in recent years, 
reflecting the increasing interest in this field. In this section, we systematically review existing 
literature, specifically focusing on the use of Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) in higher 
education and natural language communication and identify the knowledge gap that justifies the 
present research. 
A critical paper by Huang, Saleh, and Liu (2021) provides an overview of AI applications in 
education, including adaptive learning, teaching evaluation, and virtual classrooms. This study 
highlights the potential of AI to promote education reform and enhance teaching and learning in 
various educational contexts. Essel et al. (2022) presents a study on the effectiveness of a chatbot 
as a virtual teaching assistant in higher education in Ghana, demonstrating that students who 
interacted with the chatbot performed better academically compared to those who interacted with 
the course instructor. This empirical evidence supports the potential of VTAs to improve student 
academic performance. Crompton and Song (2021) provide a comprehensive overview of AI in 
higher education, discussing its potential in various aspects such as bespoke learning, intelligent 
tutoring systems, facilitating collaboration, and automated grading. This paper contributes to the 
broader discourse on the integration of AI and natural language processing in education. 
In addition to these empirical studies, several recent publications delve further into AI-
enhanced educational systems. Akgun and Greenhow (2021) discuss the ethical challenges of 
using AI in education and the potential applications, such as personalized learning platforms and 
automated assessment systems. Ewing and Demir (2021) discuss ethical challenges in 
engineering decision making using AI from educational perspective. Bahja (2020) offers a 

 
comprehensive explanation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), its history, development, and 
application in various industrial sectors. In the context of large language models, Neumann et 
al.'s (2023) paper explores the potential approaches for integrating ChatGPT into higher 
education, focusing on the effects of ChatGPT on higher education in software engineering and 
scientific writing. Pursnani et al. (2023) assessed the performance of ChatGPT on the US 
fundamentals of engineering exam (FE Exam) and did a comprehensive assessment of 
proficiency and potential implications for professional environmental engineering practice. Sajja 
et al. introduce an AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on GPT-3 
and focused on curriculum- and syllabus-oriented support, which automatically generates course-
specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or academic level.  
Furthermore, Tack and Piech (2022) examine the pedagogical abilities of Blender and GPT-3 
in educational dialogues, finding that conversational agents perform well on conversational 
uptake but are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical dimensions, 
especially helpfulness. Lee (2022) explores the potential of ChatGPT in medical education, 
discussing its potential to increase student engagement and enhance learning, as well as the need 
for further research to confirm these claims and address the ethical issues and potential harmful 
effects. Perkins et al. (2022) examine the academic integrity considerations of students' use of AI 
tools using large language models, such as ChatGPT, in formal assessments, emphasizing the 
need for updated academic integrity policies to consider the use of these tools in future 
educational environments. Lastly, Audras et al. (2021) discuss the potential application of VTAs 
to reduce the burden on teachers across secondary schools in China, emphasizing the need for 
careful design and attention to student support. 
In conclusion, the existing literature highlights the potential benefits and challenges of using 
AI-based VTAs in higher education. While there is a growing body of research on the design, 
implementation, and effectiveness of VTAs, several key areas remain to be addressed in the 
literature. These include the scalability and adaptability of such systems across diverse learning 
contexts, their potential impact on the future trajectory of higher education, and the integration of 
these systems with Learning Management Systems (LMS). 
Furthermore, most studies have not considered the incorporation of class recordings and class 
interactions in their AI-based solutions, which could potentially enrich the knowledge base of 
VTAs and provide a more comprehensive learning experience for students. Additionally, 
existing literature has not extensively addressed the need for a solution that caters to both 
students and instructors, striking a balance between personalized assistance and instructor 
support. 
Another critical aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the literature is the potential 
for cheating and academic dishonesty that may arise with the use of AI-based VTAs. Ensuring 
academic integrity and preventing cheating should be an integral part of any AI-enabled 
educational solution, yet there is a dearth of research exploring effective prevention mechanisms 
(Kasneci et al., 2023). 

 
The current study aims to address these gaps by designing, implementing, and evaluating an 
AI-enabled Intelligent Assistant (AIIA) for personalized and adaptive learning in higher 
education. Proposed AIIA seeks to seamlessly integrate with existing LMS, utilize class 
recordings and class interactions, cater to the needs of both students and instructors, and 
incorporate measures to ensure academic integrity and prevent cheating. By addressing these 
knowledge gaps, this study contributes to the ongoing efforts towards the development and 
implementation of effective AI-based educational solutions in higher education. 
 
3. Methodology 
The primary objective of this research is to address the growing need for innovative educational 
solutions in higher education, catering to the diverse needs of learners and fostering an inclusive, 
equitable, and engaging learning environment. By harnessing the power of conversational AI and 
advanced natural language processing techniques, the proposed framework seeks to improve 
learning experiences and outcomes in postsecondary education, while bridging learning gaps and 
facilitating continuous learning through flexible educational pathways. The AIIA aims to be 
discipline-independent, scalable, and seamlessly integrated across institutions, thereby unlocking 
its potential to impact a broad spectrum of students and educators. 
The transformative nature of AIIA lies in its convergence of advanced AI technologies with 
effective educational principles, promoting self-regulated learning, fostering student-faculty

Effect", ultimately contributing to increased learning proficiency and mitigating educational 
inequality. Additionally, the integration of AIIA into various communication channels ensures 
accessibility for students of diverse backgrounds, further promoting equity in higher education. 
This research is poised to make a significant contribution to the ongoing discourse on the 
integration of AI and natural language processing in education, shaping the future trajectory of 
higher education and empowering the next generation of professionals. 
 
3.1. Natural Language Inference 
Large language models (LLMs) use deep learning algorithms to analyze and generate human 
language, having applications ranging from chatbots to translation systems. Trained on extensive 
text data, LLMs like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), PaLM 
(Chowdhery et al., 2022), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2020), RoBERTa 
(Liu et al., 2019), ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) can generate 
responses emulating human-like communication. 
OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 (GPT-3.5) serves as a leading-edge 
autoregressive language model, capable of synthesizing textual content akin to human 
composition. The model's versatility is demonstrated through its adaptability to an array of 
applications, a feature attributable to few-shot learning and fine-tuning methods. Few-shot 
learning allows the model to tackle unfamiliar tasks with minimal example provision, leveraging 
its extensive pre-training on a wide variety of internet text data. Conversely, fine-tuning involves 
training the model on a significant number of task-specific examples, thereby augmenting its 
performance in distinct application domains and obviating the need for examples in the prompt. 
For the study, we selected GPT-3.5 due to its user-friendly API and advanced natural 
language processing capabilities. We utilized the "text-davinci-003" variant, a GPT-3 model built 
on InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), appreciated for its few-shot learning and fine-tuning 
capabilities. Additionally, we also employed other GPT-3.5 models, including "gpt-3.5-turbo" 
for text completions, a fine-tuned Davinci model for query classification, and a Fine-Tuned 
Curie model for open-ended question generation. 
 
3.1.1. Text Embeddings 
In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), embeddings are numerical representations 
that help computers understand the meaning and context of different concepts. They are used in 
various applications such as search functions, recommendations, and categorizations, offering 

 
significant benefits. For this research, we used OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 (Greene et al., 
2022) model to convert various classroom materials - including assignments, announcements, 
lecture notes, forum posts, and recordings - into text embeddings. This model is well-suited for 
dealing with long documents and provides embeddings with 1,536 dimensions (Greene et al., 
2022). This conversion process forms the basis for the development of a search algorithm that 
uses cosine similarity to find documents most relevant to a user's query. By turning course 
materials into embeddings, we can efficiently find and retrieve relevant information without the 
need to manually search each document. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of using 
embeddings in NLP tasks, particularly in the context of document search and retrieval. This 
contributes to a system capable of providing accurate and specific responses.  
In assessing the semantic similarity between two vectors, it is essential to compare the 
generated word embeddings. Cosine similarity, a measure calculating the cosine of the angle 
between two vectors, is often employed for this purpose. This process essentially conducts a dot 
product operation between the vectors. When the vectors perfectly align at 0 degrees, the cosine 
value becomes 1, representing complete similarity. For angles other than 0 degrees, the cosine 
value drops below 1, further decreasing as the angle widens. Thus, the larger the cosine 
similarity, the more closely aligned or "similar" the two-word embeddings are (Gunawan et al., 
2018). 
This similarity metric underpins the search algorithm's operation, aiding in identifying 
documents most relevant to a user's query. The algorithm prioritizes vectors with higher cosine 
similarity values, thereby enhancing search precision. By employing cosine similarity, the 
system identifies the most appropriate match within the course data embeddings and curates a list 
of 10 documents with the highest correlation to the user's query. Only those exhibiting a 
similarity score above 75% are retained, with their text forming the context for responding to the 
user's query. 
To uphold a high accuracy level prompt engineering techniques are applied to prevent 
hallucination, ensuring VirtualTA does not furnish incorrect responses. In scenarios where the 
model lacks confidence in its response, it refrains from providing an answer and instead conveys 
a message of uncertainty. This mechanism plays a crucial role in averting the propagation of 
erroneous information, thereby ensuring that users receive only accurate and reliable 
information. 
 
3.1.2. Transcription and Speaker Diarisation 
In response to the widespread shift to remote learning following the Covid-19 pandemic, the 
recording of lectures and classes has become a prevalent practice. Recognizing the potential of 
these rich, yet underutilized resources, our research aimed to incorporate these recorded 
materials into VirtualTA system via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology. To this 
end, we adopted Whisper, an ASR system developed by OpenAI (Radford et al., 2022), trained 
on a substantial corpus of multilingual and multitask supervised data, totaling 680,000 hours. 

 
Whisper allows us to transcribe speech from recorded classes into textual data, which can 
subsequently be processed and analyzed by the system. 
This integration significantly expands the data pool available for analysis and query 
resolution, enhancing our ability to support student learning. By including speech data from class 
recordings, we not only augment the comprehensiveness of our responses, but also facilitate a 
more effective transfer of knowledge. This approach underscores our commitment to fully 
exploiting available resources, as we continuously strive to enhance the learning experiences of 
students. 
 
3.2. System Architecture 
The System Architecture of the Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Intelligent Assistant (AIIA) 
(Figure 1) framework serves as the foundation for its operation and functionalities within the 
higher education context. This architecture comprises four primary components: 1) Data 
Retrieval, which focuses on obtaining and processing various data resources through CANVAS 
integration and transcription services; 2) Core Framework, which encompasses the design and 
implementation of language services, system design, and server management to ensure efficient 
operation; 3) Intelligent Services, which includes the Virtual TA, Study Partner, and Instructor 
Assistant functionalities that cater to the diverse needs of students and instructors; and 4) 
Communication, which facilitates seamless interaction between the system and its users through 
web-based chatbots, accessibility features, and multi-platform support. This comprehensive 
architecture enables the AIIA framework to deliver personalized and adaptive learning 
experiences, fostering enhanced engagement and improved learning outcomes in higher 
education environments. 
 
3.2.1. Data Resources: Categorization, Prioritization, and Transparency 
VirtualTA system utilizes a range of data resources in its operation, primarily targeting elements 
intrinsic to the course structure. Table 1 provides an overview of these key resources, which 
include but are not limited to Assignments, Announcements, Discussions, Lectures, and External 
Reading Materials. Each resource type plays a distinct role within VirtualTA’s architecture, 
contributing to the system's ability to accurately respond to student queries. For example, 
Assignments are used to gauge the context of the student's query, while Announcements ensure 
that the system can provide the most up-to-date information regarding the course. To manage the 
various resource types efficiently, a unique data structure has been implemented. This structure 
not only categorizes the resources but also prioritizes them based on their relevance to the 
learning objectives of the course.  
For instance, primary resources such as Lectures are given a higher priority compared to 
secondary resources like External Reading Materials. This hierarchical approach ensures that the 
system first seeks answers from the most critical resources, thereby enhancing the accuracy and 
reliability of the responses generated. Furthermore, this structured approach also offers 
traceability, allowing the system to identify and disclose the resources it used to derive an 

 
answer. This feature adds a layer of transparency to the system's operation, providing users with 
insights into the sources of the information supplied, and contributing to their confidence in the 
system's responses. 
 
Figure 1. System architecture of VirtualTA 
 
Table 1: Overview of Key Course Resources Used by VirtualTA System 
Resource 
Description 
Assignments 
Instructor-issued tasks intended for gauging students' comprehension 
and course progression. VirtualTA system utilizes this data not only for 
tracking assignment deadlines but also for understanding the context of 
the assignment. This assists in detecting whether a student's query is 
assignment-related, enabling more targeted and effective assistance. 
Discussions 
Forums for students to engage in discourse about course-related topics. 
Utilized by VirtualTA to answer questions and provide insights. 
Announcements 
Vital notifications issued by instructors regarding course alterations, 
deadlines, or events. VirtualTA system maintains an updated record of 
these announcements, facilitating accurate and timely responses to 
students' inquiries with the most current information available. 
Lectures 
Recorded or live teaching sessions that deliver course content. 
VirtualTA uses lecture transcripts to answer queries related to course 
content.  
Reading Materials Required or recommended readings for the course. VirtualTA can use 
these materials to answer relevant questions, summarize complex 
readings, or create reading plans. 
Quizzes 
Short assessments designed to test a student's grasp of recent course 
material. VirtualTA can assist students in quiz preparation by 
generating similar questions for practice. 

 
3.2.2. Knowledge Base Generation 
VirtualTA chatbot is empowered by a comprehensive knowledge generation process that 
incorporates extraction, parsing, and encoding of resources obtained from a learning 
management system (LMS). This extensive process comprises a series of steps that ensure 
optimal utilization of available resources and enhance the efficiency of the chatbot. The initial 
stage revolves around acquiring a wealth of information encapsulated in documents such as 
lecture files, lecture recordings, and reading materials. The acquisition process also includes 
additional resources such as assignments, discussion board entries, quiz information, and course 
announcements. 
Upon data acquisition, a parsing technique is employed where applicable. This technique, 
primarily applied to file-format data, meticulously breaks down the text into manageable chunks, 
each consisting of approximately 800 characters. This operation is conducted with the utmost 
care to ensure words and sentences remain intact, thus enabling the production of coherent and 
meaningful blocks of information. However, it is important to note that some resources bypass 
the parsing stage. Announcements and assignment details, typically supplied by the LMS API, 
are already presented in a structured JSON format. Their inherent structure eliminates the need 
for parsing, streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency. 
Subsequent to data extraction and parsing, the resulting information is encoded into text 
embeddings. In this transformative phase, the 800-character blocks are metamorphosed into 
high-dimensional vector representations. This process not only preserves but also enhances the 
semantic richness of the course content. The set of embeddings created forms the fundamental 
knowledge base of VirtualTA chatbot. These embeddings enable the chatbot to offer advanced, 
intelligent services to both students and instructors as detailed in Section 4. 
 
 
Figure 2: Autonomous knowledge base population 
 
Figure 2 offers a visual representation of the autonomous knowledge base generation 
process. The sequence begins with the acquisition of data resources (documents and other 
elements), proceeds through data extraction and parsing (or bypassing parsing), followed by the 
generation of embeddings. This culminates in the formation of the output – a robust, dynamic 
knowledge base. 
 
3.2.3. Advanced Query Interpretation and Response Generation 
In the core application of the system, a multistage process is deployed prior to generating a 
response to a user's query, a process integral to the efficient functioning of the system. This 
process is elucidated in the subsections below. 

 
Query Classification: The system begins by distinguishing the nature of the user's query, a 
process known as query classification. This phase discerns the type and intent of the question, 
facilitating a more focused and relevant response. 
Context Generation and Embedding Matching: Subsequent to classification, the system 
transitions to the context generation phase. The user's question is transformed into a text 
embedding, a vectorized representation that allows the query to be accurately compared to the 
existing knowledge base. The system employs cosine similarity to identify the closest match 
within the course data embeddings. A list of the ten documents with the highest correlation to the 
user's query is curated, retaining only those with a similarity score exceeding 75%. The text from 
these documents is then utilized to form the context for the system's response. 
Response Generation and Hallucination Mitigation: To uphold the accuracy and relevance of 
the system's output, we selectively apply fine-tuning models to certain features. These models 
assist in generating various question types, including open-ended, true/false, and multiple-choice 
questions. In the subsequent stage, prompt engineering techniques are utilized to mitigate 
hallucination — the generation of incorrect or irrelevant information — thereby ensuring the 
Virtual TA does not produce inaccurate responses. 
Error Prevention Mechanism: A unique feature of the system is its built-in error prevention 
mechanism. If the model lacks confidence in the accuracy of its response, it refrains from 
providing an answer. Instead, it communicates a message such as "I'm not sure," which aids in 
preventing the dissemination of erroneous information. This feature ensures that users only 
receive information that is both accurate and reliable. 
User Intent Fulfillment: This is the final stage, where the classified query (from the Query 
Classification step) is executed, fulfilling the user's specific intent. For instance, if the user wants 
a question answered, a topic summarized, automatic code generation, question generation, or an 
essay outline on a given topic, the system will proceed accordingly to meet the user's needs. 
 
3.2.4. Cyberinfrastructure and Integration 
The proposed framework is grounded on a centralized, web-based cyberinfrastructure 
responsible for various tasks, including data acquisition, training of deep learning models, 
storage and processing of course-specific information, and hosting the generated chatbots for 
utilization in a frontend application. The cyberinfrastructure comprises an NGINX web server 
and NodeJS-based backend logic, bolstered by a PostgreSQL database, caching mechanisms, and 
modules for user and course management. The heart of this setup is the intelligent assistant, 
architected on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that enables plug-and-play integration 
with any web platform supporting webhooks. The key elements of this section include a student 
chat interface with multimodal responses, an instructor interface for resource management and 
analytics, a new JS library for LMS integration, and the Whisper-based Speech API for 
transcription services. 
Student Chat Interface: The AIIA system features a web-based chat interface with 
multimodal responses, allowing for efficient communication between students and VirtualTA. 

 
Interaction with VirtualTA system is enabled through a specially developed API, which retrieves 
the system's responses for presentation to the user via the chatbot. This chat interface is 
integrated directly into Canvas, providing students with easy access to the AI assistant and 
encouraging them to engage with the LMS more frequently. By embedding the chatbot within 
the familiar Canvas platform, the AIIA system ensures a smooth and seamless user experience 
for students. 
Instructor Dashboard: The administrative interface, built using React, empowers instructors 
to manage the resources utilized by the AIIA system. This interface allows instructors to enable 
or disable specific resources, providing control over the information accessible to students. 
Additionally, the instructor dashboard offers access to analytics, enabling instructors to monitor 
student engagement and performance. 
LMS Integration: To facilitate seamless integration with various LMSs, particularly with 
Canvas, a new JavaScript library has been developed. This library enables the AIIA system to 
interact with multiple courses, retrieve and preprocess relevant data, and regenerate course 
embeddings as needed. By providing compatibility with a broadly adopted LMS, the AIIA 
system ensures its adaptability and applicability across diverse educational settings. 
Speech API: The Speech API, implemented as a backend-service in Python and served via 
Flask, is based on WHISPER and pyannote (i.e., a Python package for neural speaker diarisation) 
and plays a pivotal role in providing transcription services for the AIIA system. The API offers a 
variety of tailored endpoints, catering to different transcription use cases including transcribing 
video content from Canvas file URLs, with or without timestamps, and transcribing videos from 
YouTube URLs or other specified URLs, also with or without timestamps. These versatile 
endpoints enable the AIIA system to efficiently transcribe video content from a diverse range of 
sources, ensuring that the AI assistant has access to a comprehensive array of course materials 
and information to provide accurate, context-aware responses to student queries.

provide a condensed summary as an answer. Similar to the question-answering feature, a 
disclaimer accompanies the response, indicating the confidence level and information source. It 
is important to note that the summarization feature aims to provide a brief overview, and for 
more comprehensive or critical matters, consulting an expert is recommended. 
 

 
4.1.6. Context-Aware Conversation 
To provide a more engaging and personalized experience, the system is designed to replicate the 
communication style of the student for better understanding and empathy. By analyzing the 
student's language patterns and preferences, the system adapts its responses to align with the 
student's communication style. To manage the conversation history effectively and ensure token 
limits are handled appropriately, we employ a dynamic rewriting and rotation approach to 
maintain relevant context while interacting with large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, 
the system is designed to adopt an uplifting, helpful, and empathetic persona. It aims to provide 
guidance, support, and relevant information to the student in a positive and constructive manner. 
In addition to adapting the communication style, VirtualTA system also incorporates techniques 
to identify the emotional state of the student. This capability enables the system to recognize 
when students are in need of empathy and understanding, allowing it to tailor its responses 
accordingly to provide the appropriate level of emotional support.

feature for assignments. This feature allows instructors to provide us with the solutions, 
including the questions and their corresponding correct answers. Additionally, instructors can 
submit the students' responses to the questions, with the ability to upload PDF files for 
convenience. The system then automatically evaluates the submitted answers against the 
provided solutions, providing scores for each question. Furthermore, the system generates 
reasoning and explanations to justify the assigned scores, aiding instructors in understanding the 
evaluation outcomes. It is important to note that the auto-evaluator is not intended to replace the 
instructor's grading but rather to provide valuable insights and facilitate decision-making during 
the grading process. Ultimately, it aims to assist instructors by providing an initial evaluation and 
supporting their assessment of student assignments. 
Figure 9, displayed below, illustrates the output of the auto-evaluator feature. In this 
scenario, the instructor supplies the system with a key (correct answers) and the students' 
solutions. The system then generates scores for each question and provides corresponding 
explanations. While the system's scoring may occasionally be lenient, it still serves as a valuable 
tool for instructors in making final grading decisions, especially when accompanied by the 
explanations provided.  
To facilitate visual assessment in the grading process, a color-coded system has been 
employed for question grading. This system highlights questions with a score of less than or 
equal to two in red, questions with a score of less than or equal to five in yellow, and questions 
with a score greater than five in green. This color scheme enables instructors to swiftly discern 
the performance level of each question, thus streamlining the evaluation process.
