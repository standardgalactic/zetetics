GRW Theory (Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber Model
of Quantum Mechanics)
Roman Frigg
Consider a toy system consisting of a marble and box. The marble has two states,
|in⟩and |out⟩, corresponding to the marble being inside or outside the box. These
states are eigenvectors of the operator ˆB, measuring whether the marble is inside
or outside the box. The formalism of quantum mechanics (QM) has it that not only
|in⟩and |out⟩themselves, but any  superposition |m⟩= a |in⟩+ b |out⟩
where a and b are complex numbers such that |a|2 + |b|2 = 1, can be the state
of the marble. What are the properties of the marble in such a state? This ques-
tion is commonly answered by appeal to the so-called Eigenstate-Eigenvalue Rule
(EER): An observable ˆO has a well-deﬁned value for a quantum a system S in state
|⟩if, and only if, |⟩is an eigenstate of ˆO. Since |in⟩and |out⟩are eigen-
states of ˆB, EER yields that the marble is either inside (or outside) the box if its
state is |in⟩(or |out⟩). However, states like |m⟩defy interpretation on the ba-
sis of EER and we have to conclude that if the marble is in such a state then it
is neither inside nor outside the box. This is unacceptable because we know from
experience that marbles are always either inside or outside boxes. Reconciling this
fact of everyday experience with the quantum formalism is the infamous measure-
ment problem. See also  Bohmian mechanics; Measurement theory; Metaphysics
