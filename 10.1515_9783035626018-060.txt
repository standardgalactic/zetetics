The ARCHITECT
The PRESENT thing is gone,
the moment I close the package,
as the slit of the outer presence
of the complex plane ­passes by
…
there is PROCESSING,
the MEMORY of the PAST
…
and the slit opens again
and the delivery is unpacked:
a phone call,
a pair of shoes,
a bank transfer,
a glass of honey,
an email,
a Google request,
an image changed by Photoshop,
a laser print,
a new track of music,
a weather forecast
…
The Dominance  
of LOGIC
Today’s thinking
is dominated
by  LOGIC  and the CALCULUS
because this is so intuitive,
so simple.
It mimics old habits.
It takes an intellectual effort
to make this clear distinction:
LOGISTICS is COMPUTING.
It is of LIGHT.
It is not of LOGIC and CALCULATION.
It is not MASSIVE.

The VISUAL
The AUDITIVE
Forgetting this distinction,
I lose my VISION of the FUTURE,
my MEMORY of the PAST.
my package,
my address,
my code,
my self
…
The SOUND of the WORLD
becomes flat and monotone.
The Dominance  
of ECONOMY
It is important to point out
that the CALCULUS is with  ECONOMY ,
and COMPUTATION with  POLITICS .
They circulate on the COMPLEX plane.

This again
takes an effort:
ECONOMY is about ­the correctness 
and the logical necessities
of the NIGHT.
ECONOMY
IMAGINES the FUTURE
from the PAST.
