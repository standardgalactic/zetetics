Preface 
The study ofthree-dimensional continua has been a traditional part of graduate 
education in solid mechanics for some time. With rational simplifications to the 
three-dimensional theory of elasticity, the engineering theories of medium-thin 
plates and of thin shells may be derived and applied to a large class of engi-
neering structures distinguished by a characteristically small dimension in one 
direction. Often, these theories are developed somewhat independently due to 
their distinctive geometrical and load-resistance characteristics. On the other 
hand, the two systems share a common basis and might be unified under the 
classification of Surface Structures after the German term Fliichentragwerke. 
This common basis is fully exploited in this book. 
A substantial portion of many traditional approaches to this subject has been 
devoted to constructing classical and approximate solutions to the governing 
equations of the system in order to proceed with applications. Within the 
context of analytical, as opposed to numerical, approaches, the limited general-
ity of many such solutions has been a formidable obstacle to applications 
involving complex geometry, material properties, and/or loading. It is now 
relatively routine to obtain computer-based solutions to quite complicated 
situations. However, the choice of the proper problem to solve through the 
selection of the mathematical model remains a human rather than a machine 
task and requires a basis in the theory of the subject. 
With the requirement of a strong grounding in the engineering theories of 
shells and plates remaining firm, this book presents a unified development 
with emphasis on the fundamental engineering aspects. The basic material is 
designed to be covered in a single semester graduate course or through equiv-
alent self-study; also, ample enrichment is provided for further independent 
study. Initially, the geometrical relationships are developed on a somewhat 
general level, with specific applications to frequently encountered forms. Fol-
lowing the geometric description of the surface and the consideration of equi-
librium, we introduce a first logical simplification, the membrane theory of 
shells. After a further theoretical exposition of linear deformations, constitutive 
relationships, and energy principles, we present the flexural theory of plates 
and the bending theory of shells, including elastic instability. Although this 
sequence postpones the introduction of the complete theory of plates until much 
of the theory of shells is covered, we believe it is logical and consistent with the 
vii

Preface 
unifying objective of the text. Additionally, instructive exercises are provided 
at the end each chapter. 
The fundamental geometric and static relationships are considered from an 
integrated mathematical and physical point of view. Orthogonal curvilinear 
coordinates and vector calculus are used to provide a concise general derivation 
of the field equations. Early on, however, we present the physical resolution 
and interpretation of forces and deformations for specialized geometric forms 
such as rotational shells and flat plates. We believe that the physical notions 
are more meaningful in the specialized geometric context, whereas the mathe-
matical formulation yields a conciseness not attainable with a strictly physical 
viewpoint. Also, we stress the energy aspects of the formulations because of the 
importance of energy methods in modern computational techniques. 
With regard to applications, our focus is on classical examples that illustrate 
the basic resistance mechanisms of selected configurations without undue 
mathematical complications. The availability of numerically based, computer-
implemented solution algorithms has diminished the need to rely on cumber-
some, sometimes oversimplified, analytical solutions for complex problems; 
hence, they are paid scant attention in this text. Rather, we emphasize the 
essential aspects of equilibrium and compatibility, as they apply to the resistance 
of surface loading and the satisfaction of boundary constraints. We believe that 
a firm grasp of these principles is necessary to perform the vital critical inter-
pretation required of the analyst when computer-based solutions are employed. 
This book is dedicated to developing in the engineer the physical and mathe-
matical understanding required to perform analysis and design in an interactive 
computer-assisted environment. The book is also designed to provide a founda-
tion of the subject which will enable the interested reader to progress to more 
advanced texts and technical papers. 
Of special interest in the book is a thorough treatment of hyperboloidal shells 
of revolution. This topic is of current interest because of the wide use of this 
form in cooling tower applications. 
Regarding the background of the reader, this book is written primarily for 
advanced students and practitioners in Civil, Mechanical, and Aeronautical 
Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. We presume that the reader has an 
elementary knowledge of vector calculus and matrix algebra, and some familiar-
ity with the linear theory of elasticity.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction 
1.1 Role of the Theory of Elasticity 
The theory of elasticity is the basis for several engineering theories which, in 
turn, are applied to mechanical and structural design. The basic components 
of the elasticity problem are often designated as equilibrium, compatibility, and 
a constitutive law. The equilibrium equations represent a statement of Newton's 
laws, which are restricted here to the static case. The compatibility conditions 
express the kinematic relationships between strains and displacements, and the 
constitutive law embodies the stress-strain behavior of the material which is 
presumed here to be linear elastic. In general, this set of basic components may 
be collected as a set of differential equations or as an energy principle. The 
simultaneous satisfaction of each component of the elasticity problem often 
is foreboding from the mathematical standpoint; therefore, engineers have 
naturally looked to simplifications and approximations. 
One common simplification often imposed on elasticity problems has been 
to formulate less restrictive theories based on distinctive geometric characteris-
tics. Among the relaxed theories, we find (1) the theory of beams, which is 
concerned with flexural members having one dimension characteristically far 
greater than the other two; (2) the theory of plates, which treats initially flat 
components having two dimensions far greater than the third; and (3) the theory 
of shells, which deals with curved bodies having one small dimension. Within 
these three theories, there are a variety of subtheories. For the purposes of this 
introduction it is sufficient to refer to the most common subtheory for each 
case; e.g., (1) shallow beam theory; (2) medium-thin plate theory, and (3) thin shell 
theory. 
Although a beam may be considered as a one-dimensional member, whereas 
plates and shells are two-dimensional, the similarities in the theories are nu-
merous, and the beam serves as a useful analogue for the exposition of the higher 
theories. 
1.2 Engineering Theories 
Sections of a beam, a plate, and a shell are shown in figure 1-1. On each figure,

noted as h and I, respectively. Also, a reference position is identified in the 
transverse direction, midway between the boundaries for symmetric cross sec-
tions. We call this reference position the neutral or middle axis for a beam, the 
middle plane for a plate, and the middle surface for a shell. In the ensuing 
treatment, the terms plane and plate, and surface and shell, are used synon-
ymously and interchangeably to avoid repetitive distinction between the mathe-
matical and physical objects. 
The initial step in the derivation of each of the simplified theories usually 
consists of a set of assumptions with respect to the ratio of the characteristic 
dimensions, the relative magnitude of the deflection under the applied loading, 
the rotation of a normal to the undeformed reference position, and the stresses

in the transverse directions. The statement and justification of these assump-
tions are largely attributable to several distinguished mathematicians and 
scientists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Thus, we have the Navier 
hypothesis and the Bernoulli-Euler theory for beams, the Kirchhoff theory of 
plates, and Love's first approximation to the theory of shells. a.1 
These assumptions are collected in table 1-1. A number of comments with 
respect to the assumptions and justifications are appropriate: 
[lJ This assumption may be regarded as the most fundamental, since it clearly 
delineates the class of problems with which we are concerned from a 
physical standpoint. Also, [lJ is the justification for [3J and [4]. The 
bounds on h/l are only approximate and are subject to considerable 
latitude depending on loading, geometry, etc. 
[2J This assumption is independent, although the cases for which it would be 
violated might well coincide with the lower range of h/l stated in [1]. If 
[2J is not justified, geometrically nonlinear theories can be formulated 
retaining the remaining assumptions. (An illustration of such a formula-
tion is presented in section 8.7.) We may also accommodate material 
nonlinearities within the range of [2]. However, as the magnitude of the 
admissible displacements increases, the possibility of exceeding the limits 
of linear elastic material behavior increases proportionally. 
[3J This assumption is developed in detail within the treatment of deforma-
tions in chapter 5. When only classical solution techniques were available, 
the suppression of transverse shearing strains permitted many otherwise 
intractable problems to be approached. With powerful numerical pro-
cedures now well developed, this necessity has diminished, although it is 
still popular. It has been suggested in an independent observation that this 
strategy, originally conceived to facilitate analytical solutions, indeed often 
complicates numerically based solutions. 2 Relaxation of [3J enables the 
upper limit on h/l in [1] to be extended in many cases. 
[4J Situations for which assumption would not be justified, apart from the 
immediate vicinity of concentrated loads, would coincide with the upper 
limits of [1]. 
The assumptions and consequences collected in table 1-1 are of utmost 
importance in what follows and are referred to frequently. 
1.3 Load Resistance Mechanisms 
The common basis of shallow beam, medium-thin plate, and thin shell theories 
is illustrated by the unified set of underlying assumptions. However, the means

for resisting applied loading among these structural forms may be quite dif-
ferent. Idealized free-body diagrams of the three cases, along with an additional 
form, the arch, are shown in figure 1-2. For simplicity, only a vertical loading 
is shown in each case, but the following observations are generally valid for any 
distributed loading. 
The beam, being straight, depends on the shear V to resist transverse loading. 
In turn, V, acting together with the loading and reaction R, requires a moment 
M for equilibrium. The beam may be classified as a one-dimensional flexural 
member. 
The arch, because it is curved, can develop a thrust N to resist the applied 
loading, in addition to the shear V. Although V and M are still present in the 
general case, the efficiency ofthe arch form lies primarily in resisting the loading 
with N and minimizing V and M. The arch may be called a one-dimensional 
extensional member. 
The plate, being flat, relies on the transverse shear V to resist transverse

loading in the same manner as the beam. The two-dimensional configuration 
results in bending moments M and, additionally, twisting moments T on each 
internal face. Because the loading is generally carried in both directions and 
because the twisting rigidity in isotropic plates is quite significant, a plate is 
considerably stiffer than a beam of comparable span and thickness. The plate 
may be considered a two-dimensional flexural member. 
The shell, being curved, can develop thrusts N to form the primary resistance 
mechanism in addition to those forces and moments present in the plate. Also, 
the two-dimensional curved configuration mobilizes an in-plane shear S in each 
direction. Although V, M, and T are still present in the general case, the 
efficiency of the shell form rests with the reliance on Nand S as the primary 
means of resistance, with V, M, and T minimized. The shell may be termed a 
two-dimensional extensional member. Furthermore, whereas an arch of a spe-
cific shape can resist only one loading pattern in a purely extensional state, a 
shell can remain virtually momentless for a variety of loadings. The classifica-
tion of these forms is summarized in table 1-2. 
Of course, there is some overlap within the classification in table 1-2. One 
common situation is the presence of axial loading in a beam and, corre-
spondingly, in-plane loading in a plate. Within the limitations of assumption 
[2J, these effects, called rod and diaphragm action, respectively, are uncoupled 
from the primary action and may be combined with the flexural behavior by 
superposition. The study of instability, however, involves a coupling between 
extensional and flexural effects. 
Another possibility with respect to the beam or plate is the presence of axial 
or in-plane forces which develop a transverse component through curvature 
induced by the flexural action. This case may be treated only with a relaxation 
of assumption [2J. 
A third combination, which is of considerable practical importance, is a form 
curved in only one direction, such as a cylinder or cone. Although these 
so-called developable surfaces are generally regarded as shells , the resistance 
mechanism in the uncurved direction is basically flexural, whereas that in the 
curved direction may be primarily extensional. 
As a further introductory comment, it should be pointed out that structural 
materials are generally far more efficient in an extensional rather than in a 
flexural mode, making the arch and shell preferable over the beam and plate. 
The extensional mode, within the scope of small deformations, can be developed

only through initial curvature; this limits the application of arches and shells 
both from a fabrication and from a utilization standpoint. The structural form 
is subject to many constraints apart from the most efficient use of the material 
and will be considered as specified a priori in most of this text. 
It is of present as well as historic!!l interest to recognize that significant 
structures were erected utilizing the efficient doubly curved form of the dome 
long before the development of modern engineering analysis. 3 Several of these 
structures survive today. The Pantheon of ancient Rome (figure 1-3), attributed 
to Marcus Agrippa and Emperor Hadrian and constructed of a cementitious 
material, has stood for about two thousand years; the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul 
(figure 1-4), originally completed by Isidorus, Jr., has epitomized Byzantine 
architecture for fifteen centuries. Beautifully tile-covered mosques from the 
Persian empire (figure 1-5) survive in Iran. Increased geometrical refinement is 
exhibited in the Renaissance cathedrals of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence 
(figure 1-6), constructed without shoring by Brunelleschi, and St. Peter's in 
Rome (figure 1-7), designed by Michelangelo. Also, Sir Christopher Wren's St. 
Paul's Cathedral (figure 1-8) remains to grace the London skyline. 
Of these ancient domes, the Pantheon and Santa Maria are regarded as 
among the greatest construction achievements of all time. 4,5 In addition to the 
obviously spectacular clear span, the roof of the Pantheon is formed with 
intersecting ribs (figure 1-3b) which provide greater stiffness and stability than 
an equivalent amount of material of uniform thickness. Further weight reduc-

efficient pointed (circular) arch profile. The cross section is composed of a

separated double wall (figure 1-6b), tied together by the meridional arches and 
a secondary system of horizontal arches. Also incorporated was a timber chain 
circling the dome to resist the somewhat vaguely understood outward thrust 
resulting from the arched meridional profile. It is remarkable that the two 
techniques used for increasing the structural efficiency of the walls of these 
ancient structures have modern counterparts, i.e., stiffened and multilayered 
shells as described in chapter 6. 
Although the ancient domes were not thin or engineered in the modern sense, 
they exhibit the.unique capability of the curved surface to bridge considerable 
space without intermediate supports utilizing construction materials capable 
of resisting only compressive forces. Modern techniques of structural analysis,

most recently computer-based finite element modeling, have revealed the intui-
tive understanding of structural mechanics exhibited by the Romans and by 
the men of the Renaissance in designing and building their spectacular domes. 
Perhaps one reason that several shells remain from antiquity is the ability of 
surface structures to survive extreme loading. It was reported that a cooling 
tower shell was among the few surviving structures in the Tangshun, China, 
earthquake of 1976.6 The hyperbolic paraboloid shown in figure 1-9 resisted 
the 1985 Mexico City earthquake without apparent structural damage amid 
totally destroyed conventional structures. 7 Surely, the ancient domes from the 
Persian empire, such as that in figure 1-5, have weathered many earthquakes. 
These examples inspire confidence in the toughness of well-designed and con-
structed surface structures, and the remainder of this book is an exposition of

the basic principles by which such structures withstand the forces of nature and 
man. 
The connection between the modern developments in thin shell technology 
and corresponding significant scientific events in the post-industrial revolution 
period are documented in chapter 1 of Fung and Sechler. 4 The remaining 
chapters of that modern collection of papers (which is devoted to the unification 
of theory, experiment, and design of thin shell structures) is probably best 
appreciated after the fundamental material presented in this book has been 
mastered.

1 It has been claimed that structural materials are generally more efficient in an 
extensional rather than a bending mode. To illustrate this, consider the two cases 
shown in figure 1-10. Both structures span the same distance 2L, carry the same load 
P, and contain the same amount of material. For a span of L = 40, compare the 
maximum fiber stress in each case.

CHAPTER 2 
Geometry 
2.1 Curvilinear Coordinates 
Consider a portion of the middle surface of a shell as shown in figure 2-1. 
The surface is defined with respect to the X - Y -Z global Cartesian coor-
dinates by 
Z =f(X, Y) 
(2.1) 
Then, a set of coordinates a and 13 are selected which are related to the Cartesian 
system by 
X = f1(a,f3) 
Y = f2(a, 13) 
Z = f3(a,f3) 
(a)} 
(b) 
(c) 
(2.2) 
where f1' f2' and f3 are continuous, single-valued functions. Since each ordered 
pair (a, 13) corresponds to only one point on the surface, the surface is uniquely 
described in terms of a and 13, which are called curvilinear coordinates. If one 
of the coordinates, e.g., 13, is incremented 13 = 131, 13 = 132, ... ,13 = 13m then we 
define a series of parametric curves on the surface, along which only a varies. 
These curves are termed the SIX coordinate lines. Similarly, if a takes on the values 
a = a l' a = a2, ...• a = am. we get the sp coordinate lines. The coordinate lines 
are shown in figure 2-1. 
If the coordinate lines SIX and sp are mutually perpendicular at all points on 
the surface, the curvilinear coordinates are said to be orthogonal. Orthogonal 
curvilinear coordinates are used exclusively in this book. 
2.2 Middle Surface Geometry 
Equation (2.1), which describes the middle surface, may be written in terms of 
a position vector emanating from the origin as shown in figure 2-2:

the coordinate lines are orthogonal, these tangent vectors are orthogonal as 
well, and their scalar product r,1X 0 r,(J = O. 
The vector joining the two points on the middle surface (oc, f3) and (oc + doc, 
f3 + df3) shown in figure 2-2 is 
ds = r.lXdoc + r, lX df3

which is known as the first quadratic form of the theory of surfaces. 
The quantities A and B are called Lame parameters or measure numbers and 
are fundamental to the understanding of curvilinear coordinates. To interpret 
their meaning physically, consider two cases in which each of the coordinates 
IX and fJ is varied individually and independently. For these cases, equation (2.9) 
becomes 
dsa. = AdlX 
(2. lOa) 
and 
dS{J = BdfJ 
(2. lOb) 
Thus, dsa. is the change in arc length along coordinate line sa. when IX is incre-
mented by dlX, and dS{J is the change in arc length along coordinate line s{J when 
fJ is incremented by dfJ. We see that the Lame parameters are quantities which 
relate the change in arc length on the surface to the corresponding change in 
the curvilinear coordinate; hence the alternate name, measure number. 
As a simple example, consider a circular arc of radius R in the Y - Z plane 
shown in figure 2-3. If the curvilinear coordinate is chosen as the polar angle fJ,

ds = RdP 
(2.11) 
and the Lame parameter is R. Alternately, the curvilinear coordinate could be 
chosen as the Z coordinate, in which case we have (from figure 2-3) 
From the equation of the circle y2 + Z2 = R2, 
2YdY= -2ZdZ 
or 
so that equation (2.12) gives

ds = 1 + y2

and the Lame parameter is 
(

(2.12) 
(2.13) 
A third possibility is to choose the arc length itself as the curvilinear coordinate. 
Then 
ds = 1 (ds) 
(2.14) 
and the Lame parameter is the constant 1. It is apparent from this elementary 
example that the Lame parameter may be a constant or a rather involved 
function. For a particular problem, the choice of curvilinear coordinates which 
correspond to the simplest possible expressions for the Lame parameter can 
serve to expedite the mathematics of the solution greatly. 
The preceding example illustrates that the Lame parameters may sometimes 
be found by the geometric representation of equations (2.9) and (2.10). In more 
complicated cases, we may compute the Lame parameters from equations (2.8) 
and (2.3) as

Finally, with respect to the first quadratic form, note that it generally pertains 
to the measurement of distances on the surface, but does not involve the specific 
shape of the surface.

2.3.1 Definition of Unit Tangent Vectors and Normal Section: It is convenient 
to refer all vector point functions to a triad of unit vectors composed of tangent 
vectors to the coordinate lines and a normal vector which define a right hand 
system, as shown in figure 2-4. 
We have already defined tangent vectors to the coordinate lines in equation 
(2.5). Hence, in view of equation (2.8),

and the normal vector is found by forming the vector product of t", and tp:

tn = t", x tp = AB(r,<z x r,p) 
(2.16c) 
A normal section of the surface is defined as a plane curve obtained by cutting 

22 
2 Geometry 
the surface with a plane containing the normal to the surface, tn. In particular, 
normal sections containing the unit tangent vectors t", and tp are of interest. 
2.3.2 Principal Directions: Now, consider the general point (tXi' /3j) on the mid-
dle surface as shown in figure 2-1. At this point, each coordinate line, Sp(tXi) and 
Sat(/3j), may be regarded as a normal section with a corresponding radius of 
curvature Rp(tXi' /3j) and Rat(tXi' /3j), respectively, which is directed from the center 
of curvature to the point (tXi' /3j) along tn' Obviously, there are an infinite number 
of possible Rat and Rp at any point, since an infinite number of orientations for 
the curvilinear coordinates exist. 
From the theory of surfaces, it may be shown that there is a system of 
orthogonal curvilinear coordinates (tX*, /3*) oriented such that one radius of 
curvature R: = IR:I is the maximum of all possible IRati, whereas the other 
radius of curvature R1 = IR1 I is the minimum of all possible IRp I. 1 We call this 
system the principal orthogonal curvilinear coordinates corresponding to the 
principal directions, tX* and /3*. The associated coordinate lines are known as 
the lines of principal curvature, and R: and R1 as the principal radii of curvature. 
In the subsequent derivation of unit tangent vector derivatives, principal direc-
tions will be used exclusively, so that tX and /3 imply tX* and /3*. 
2.3.3 Derivatives of Unit Tangent Vectors: To establish the relationships be-
tween the Lame parameters and the principal radii of curvature for a surface, 
it is necessary to derive a set of relationships for the derivatives of the tangent 
vectors, tat' tp• tn, with respect to tX and /3.2 The derivatives of the unit tangent 
vectors are expressed in terms of the unit tangent vectors themselves:

2.3.3.1 (I) Component in Direction of Differentiated Vector. The derivative of 
any unit tangent vector is normal to the vector itself so that there are no 
components in the direction of the vector being differentiated; e.g., there is no 
ta. component for ta.,a. or ta.,p' 
This assertion is well known from elementary vector calculus. As a proof, 
consider the scalar product of two unit tangent vectors in the curvilinear 
coordinate system:

2.4 Second Quadratic Form of the Theory of Surfaces 
Recall that in section 2.2, we derived the first quadratic form of the theory of 
surfaces, which pertains to the measurement of distances on the surface but not 
specifically to the shape of the surface. In this section, we seek information with 
respect to the latter property, the shape. 
Consider a normal section which traces a plane curve with arc length coor-
dinate Si' An example is the normal section along Sa shown in figure 2-5; 
however, Si is not necessarily restricted to only principal direction coordinate 
lines in the ensuing development. The curvature of such a section is known as 
the normal curvature Ki and is defined as a function of the position vector r, 
shown in figure 2-2, by the Frenet-Serret formula 3 as

where the negative sign corresponds to the selection oftn as the outward normal, 
i.e., directed toward the convexity of normal sections with positive curvature. 3 
We want to express the normal curvature in terms of the curvilinear coor-
dinates oc and {3. Starting with 
r.s,s, = (r,s,),s, = (r,aoc,s, + r,p{3,s,),s, 
we first evaluate

(2.22) 
Next, we scalar multiply each side of equation (2.22) by t". The last two terms 
on the right-hand side (r.h.s.) vanish, since t" is normal to r.« and r.p by equation 
(2.16). In order to simplify the first three terms of equation (2.22), we first 
consider

In equation (2.27), da and dfJ represent (oalosi) dSi and (ofJlosi) dsi, respectively, 
for a particular direction i on the surface.

The second quadratic form II thus relates to the shape of the curve through the 
presence of radii of curvature R" and Rp. 
2.5 Principal Radii of Curvature 
Thus far, we have assumed that the principal radii of curvature of the shell, 
R" and R p, are known or easily found. We now examine the details of this 
calculation. 
Consider the case where the normal section corresponding to a is a curve 
Z = f(X) in the X-Z plane. 
R = -[1 + (Z,x)2J3/2 
" 
Z,xx 
(2.29) 
When the surface is specified parametrically in terms of the curvilinear 
coordinates as in equation (2.4), we may compute the radius of curvature using 
equation (2.21). If we take the Si direction as one of the coordinate lines, e.g., S,,' 
then 
(2.30) 
Equation (2.30) was evaluated from equation (2.22), recognizing that P, •• = O. 
Since tn· r,a = 0, equation (2.30) reduces to

2.6 Gauss-Codazzi Relations

equation (2.16c),

Similarly, 
-B3A 
Rp=------
(r,<x x r,p)' r,pp 
(2.31) 
(2.32) 
Equations (2.31) and (2.32) may be evaluated from equations (2.4), (2.15), and 
(2.2) for a given geometry. 
Another technique for computing the radii of curvature that is useful for shells 
of revolution is illustrated in section 4.3.2.3. 
2.6 Gauss-Codazzi Relations 
No connective relationships between the Lame parameters, A and B, and the 
principal radii of curvature, R<x and Rp, have been set forth. To explore this 
further, consider the equality of the second mixed partials 
(2.33) 
or, from equation (2.17), 
(2.34a) 
(2.34b) 
Again, using the differential relationships in equation (2.17), we find 
(2.34c) 
With t<x and tp being mutually orthogonal, equation (2.34c) may only be satisfied 
if 
(2.35) 
and 
(2.36) 

30 
2 Geometry 
If we now consider one of the other second mixed partial derivative identities 
or 
and manipulate these equations using equation (2.17), a third differential 
relationship 
AB 
(2.37) 
results. Equations (2.35), (2.36), and (2.37) are known as the Gauss-Codazzi 
relations and define the connectivity among A, B, R"" and R p, such that these 
parameters define a surface. Equation (2.37) is particularly useful in the deriva-
tion of the equations of equilibrium and is discussed later. 
Although we will not pursue the details, note that a parallel set of equa-
tions may be derived for the deformed middle surface by starting with the 
normal vector to the deformed surface in place of tn in equation (2.33).3 The 
resulting equations, properly termed Gauss-Codazzi relations for the deformed 
middle surface, are the conditions for the continuity of the middle surface dis-
placements and the compatibility between the strains and displacements. 
They serve the same role as the St. Venant equations in the theory of elastic-
ity. We refer to such equations in connection with the bending of shells in 
chapter 9. 
2.7 Gaussian Curvature 
On the right side of equation (2.37), note the fraction 1/R",Rp, which is the 
product of the principal curvatures. This is known as the Gaussian curvature 
and plays an important role in the characterization of shells. Although the 
Gaussian curvature may be readily computed by using the equations of section 
2.5, such a calculation is seldom required for purposes of classification; it is 
often sufficient to know only the algebraic sign. 
If we consider the normal sections corresponding to the principal directions, 
the Gaussian curvature is positive if both centers of curvature lie on the same 
side of the surface and is negative if the centers lie on opposite sides. If one of 
the radii of curvatures is equal to infinity, the Gaussian curvature is zero. 
Representative cases are shown in figure 2-6. A plate is the degenerate case of 
a shell with zero Gaussian curvature, since both radii are infinite. 
Technically, the Gaussian curvature is a scalar point function, and a partic-
ular shell may have regions with positive, negative, and/or zero values. Never-
theless, a single sign predominates for most practical cases. Calladine4 has

recently reexamined the relationship between Gaussian curvature and shell 
theory, referring to Gauss's original ideas and extending the concept to faceted 
surfaces as well as traditionally curved forms. 
A classification of shells by Gaussian curvature is given in figure 2-7. With 
respect to this classification, note that only the zero curvature shells are devel-
opable and hence may be formed from flat material. This property of zero 
curvature shells contributes to their wide usage. Also, note that the negative 
curvature shells have two sets of straight or ruled lines on the surface which 
correspond to the two sets of real characteristics associated with hyperbolic 
surfaces,s so that the formwork for such a shell can be fabricated from straight 
materials. This feature of negative curvature shells is largely responsible for the 
economical usage of reinforced concrete hyperbolic paraboloid (HP) shells in 
a variety of applications. 6 
The mathematical classification refers to the type of partial differential equa-
tion associated with quadratic surfaces having the indicated Gaussian curva-
ture. If a shell is or can be approximated logically as a quadratic surface 
Z = f(X, Y), then the algebraic sign of the discriminant 
(2.38) 
determines the type of partial differential equation and, further, coincides with 
the sign of the Gaussian curvature,5 as indicated in figure 2-7. 
A variety of thin shell and plate structures are shown in figure 2-8 and will 
be referred to frequently throughout the book.

2.8 Specialization of Shell Geometry 
Because of the wide variety of plate and shell structures encountered in engi-
neering practice, several geometrical classes are of particular interest. 
2.S.1 Shallow Shells: The theory of shallow shells has wide application for roof 
shells that have a relatively small rise as compared to their spans. Considering

the surface specified in Cartesian coordinates as in equation (2.1), the shell is 
said to be shallow if, in the subsequent mathematical analysis, (Z,X)2 and (Z, y)2 
may be neglected by virtue of smallness in comparison to unity. The effect of 
this simplification is seen by considering figure 2-9. 
Consider a differential element of the middle surface bound by the intersec-
tions with two planes parallel to the Y-Z plane and separated by a distance 
dX, and two planes parallel to the X-Z plane separated by a distance dY. As 
illustrated by the inset in figure 2-9, 
dsx ~ dX[1 + (Z,x)2J1/2 
dsy ~ dY[1 + (Z,y)2]1/2 
which, when the geometric simplification is applicable, become 
dsx ~ dX 
ds y ~ dY 
(2.39a) 
(2.39b) 
(2.40a) 
(2.40b) 
The practical interpretation of equations (2.40) is that the curvilinear coor-
dinates 0( and f3 may be selected as the Cartesian coordinates X and Y with the 
Lame parameters A = B = 1. Additional approximations are introduced into 
shallow shell theory with respect to the equilibrium equations in chapter 9. 
The practical range of the theory of shallow shells is restricted to shells with 
a central rise of one-fifth or less than the span. 7 However, this theory has been 
applied to shells that may not fit the criteria in a global sense, by treating pieces

or finite elements of the shell which can be considered shallow, and then 
assembling these elements to satisfy the global geometry. B 
2.8.2 Shells of Revolution: A surface of revolution is described by rotating a 
plane curve generator around an axis of rotation to form a closed surface, as 
illustrated in figure 2-10. The lines of principal curvature are called the meri-
dians (normal sections formed by planes containing the axis of rotation) and 
parallel circles (normal sections traced by planes perpendicular to the axis of 
rotation). 
In figure 2-11, we show the meridian of a shell of revolution illustrating both 
positive and negative Gaussian curvature. The equation ofthe meridian is given 
by

(2.41 b) 
Consider a reference point on the surface. The angle formed by the extended 
normal to the surface at this point and the axis of rotation is defined as the 
meridional angle ,p; and, the angle between the radius of the parallel circle at 
the point and the X axis is designated as the circumferential angle e. Corre-
spondingly, the meridians are taken as the Sa. coordinate lines, and Ra. = R,p, 
the meridional radius of curvature. The parallel circles are the sfJ coordinate 
lines, with RfJ = Ro, the circumferential radius of curvature. The radius of the 
parallel circle, which is equal to R as defined in equation (2.41b), is termed the 
horizontal radius and is denoted by Ro. Note that Ro is not a principal radius 
of curvature, since it is not normal to the surface. Rather, it is the projection of 
Ro on the horizontal plane, i.e., 
(2.42) 
A closed shell of revolution is frequently called a dome, and the peak of such 
a shell is termed the pole. A pole introduces certain mathematical complications 
because, at this point, Ro -. O. 
In most applications, the curvilinear coordinate in the f3 or e direction is 
chosen as the circumferential angle e. Therefore, from equation (2.10b), 
dSfJ = Bdf3 = dso = Rode 
and thus 
B = Ro = Rosin,p 
(2.43a) 
(2.43b) 
In the a. or ,p direction, there are at least three useful choices for the curvilinear 
coordinate: (a) the meridional angle ,p; (b) the axial coordinate Z; and (c) the 
arc length s,p. The respective Lame parameter A for each case is: 
(a) Meridional angle, ,p: 
ds,p = R,pd,p 
and from equation (2.10) 
A=R,p 
(b) Axial coordinate, Z: 
(2.44a) 
(2.44b) 
Considering an element of arc length, similar to that shown on the inset of 
figure 2-3, but with dY = dRo 
ds~ = ds~ = dZ2 + dR6 
= dZ2 + (RO,Z)2 dZ2 
dsz = dZ[1 + (Ro,z)2r/2 
and therefore 
A = [1 + (Ro,z)2r/2

(2.45b) 
(2.45c) 

50 
2 Geometry 
(c) Arc length s",: 
A = 1 
(2.45d) 
but since the meridian is defined by Z = Z(Ro), the arc length coordinate 
must be computed by integrating equation (2.45b). Therefore, 
Sz = SZ [1 + (RO,Z)2] 1/2 dZ 
(2.46) 
Zo 
The limits of the integral indicate the coordinate Z at the origin for Sz (perhaps 
the base or top of the shell), and at the section where the coordinate is being 
evaluated, respectively. 
The choice of an appropriate curvilinear coordinate for the meridional 
direction is problem-dependent and involves several considerations. In tower-
type shells, which are essentially vertical structures, the axial coordinate Z has 
the greatest significance with respect to the physical construction of the shell. 
For relatively flat domes, however, the axial coordinate approaches zero even 
for points relatively far from the pole. The meridional angle rjJ may behave in 
a similar manner, so the arc length will be the most stable coordinate for such 
cases. Also, if the meridian has an inflection point, the coordinate rjJ might cause 
difficulties because it may not provide a one-to-one correspondence with all 
points on the shell surface. 
The most popular, but by no means universal, preference of theoreticians in 
the field of shells of revolution has been to choose the meridional angle rjJ as the 
basis for the development of the government equations. This may be due 
somewhat to historical precedent, since the early work on shells of revolution 
focused on spherical shells9 for which A = R", = constant, thereby greatly 
simplifying the ensuing treatment. 
We noted in section 2.6 that the parameters A, B, R,%, and Rp must satisfy the 
three Gauss-Codazzi conditions to define a surface. These conditions, as given 
by equations (2.35), (2.36), and (2.37), can be checked for the rjJ-(J curvilinear 
coordinate system: 
Equation (2.35):

Substituting equation (2.47) for the numerator on the left-hand side (l.h.s) 
equation (2.48) gives an identity. Thus, the Gauss-Codazzi conditions for a 
shell of revolution described by the coordinates rp and () are satisfied, provided 
equation (2.47) is valid. This equation is very useful in what follows, and it is 
instructive to derive it from a purely geometric argument. Consider the meri-
dian shown in figure 2-12:

One may desire to calculate the value of Z corresponding to a particu-
lar value of rP. With R6 = R6(~)' Ro(~) is found from equation (2.42) and substi-
tuted into equation (2.41a) to obtain the corresponding value of Z(~). If the 
arc length also is required, equation (2.46) should be evaluated. Also, a direct 
transformation between s¢ and ~ can be derived by integrating equation 
(2.44a). 
It is expedient to be able to transform derivatives with respect to ~ to 
derivatives with respect to Z, i.e., ( ),z = ( ),¢ (d~/dZ). If we consider equation 
(2.45c) with Ro,z given by Ro,¢ (d~/dZ) and R o,¢ given by equation (2.47), we 
have

for the Z coordinate. Equation (2.50) is quite useful, since it is often preferable 
to differentiate with respect to l/J first in order to utilize equation (2.47). 
The ± signs in equations (2.50) and (2.51) indicate that an increment dl/J may 
produce a change in arc length equal in magnitude but opposite in sense to that 
produced by dZ. For example, in figure 2-11 where Z is directed upward, this 
would be the case. Hit is desired to use Z as the primary meridional coordinate, 
it may be preferable to direct Z as positive downward. 10 
An alternate set of coordinates for which Z increases in direct propor-
tion to l/J is shown in figure 2-13. The right-hand convention and the outward 
directed normal, i.e., tz x to = tn, are preserved, but e is now measured from 
the Yaxis.

CHAPTER 3 
Equilibrium 
3.1 Stress Resultants and Couples 
Consider the element of the shell shown in figure 3-1(a), bounded by the normal 
sections oc, oc + doc, /3, and /3 + d/3. The geometry of the middle surface of such 
an element was considered in chapter 2 (see figures 2-2 and 2-4). Here, we show 
the entire thickness h with the coordinate, defined in the direction of tn and 
depict a differential volume element doc d/3 d, with thickness d" parallel to and 
displaced from the middle surface a distance ,. 
In figure 3-1(b), the stresses acting on the volume element are indicated. The 
sign convention is that of the theory of elasticity, with the first subscript 
indicating the surface on which the stress acts, as identified by the normal to 
that surface, and the second subscript indicating the direction in which the stress 
acts. The solution for the various stresses, shown in figure 3-1(b) at a particular 
point of the continuum (oc, /3, 0, is the fundamental problem of the theory of 
elasticity. Plate and shell theories deal with a simplification of the stress at a 
point problem. Instead of the stresses, it is considered sufficient to solve for the 
total forces and moments per length of middle surface, which are known as stress 
resultants and stress couples, respectively.! The stress at any point presumably 
can then be evaluated by back-substitution, although we will find that this can 
sometimes be done only approximately. 
We have thus alluded to the major simplification present in the plate and 
shell problem as compared to the theory of elasticity problem: the plate or shell 
problem is formulated and solved for the forces and moments per unit length 
ofthe middle surface, rather than for the stresses at each point of the continuum. 
Toward this end, we now consider the definition of the stress resultants and 
couples in terms of the stresses. 
In figure 3-2, the stress resultants and couples are shown on an element of 
the middle surface. The extensional forces N.. and N p, transverse shear forces 
Q", and Qp, and bending moments M", and Mp are represented by single 
subscripted variables indicating the surface on which the force or moment acts, 
whereas the in-plane shear forces N",p and N p"" and the twisting moments M",p 
and M p"" carry a double subscript. The first subscript corresponds to the surface 
on which the force or moment acts; the second indicates the direction in which

to be inappropriate.

At this point, we reiterate that once the plate or shell problem has been solved 
for the stress resultants and couples, the recovery of the elasticity problem 
would necessitate the inversion of equations (3.6)-(3.9), which might prove 
difficult in a mathematically exact sense. In a way, this is the price paid to realize 
a simplified theory-the sacrifice of mathematical precision to achieve a solu-
tion that is satisfactory from an engineering standpoint. 
In practice, the stresses at a particular point in the continuum are usually 
recovered from the stress resultants and couples by (a) neglecting the terms 
(1 + (IR",) and (1 + (IRp) in equations (3.6)-(3.9); and, (b) assuming that all 
stresses, except for the transverse shear stresses (J",n and (Jpn, vary linearly across 
the cross section. The preceding arguments imply that 
(J;;( 0 = (J;;(O) + ((Jii (~) - (J;;(O») h;2 
(Jij( () = (Jij(O) + ((Jij (~) - (Jij(O») h;2 
(i,j = ex, f3) 
(3. lOa) 
It is consistent with elementary theory to assume that the transverse shear 
stresses are distributed through the thickness as a second-degree parabola with 
a maximum at the middle surface. Thus, 
(3.10b) 
When these relationships are introduced into equations (3.6)-(3.9), the maxi-
mum stresses on the cross section are

(3.10e) 
Then, the stresses at any other level within the cross section are found from 
equations (3.10a) and (3. lOb). 
3.2 Equilibrium of the Shell Element 
Now that all ofthe stresses acting on the shell are referred to quantities defined 
on the middle surface, we have reduced the problem to two dimensions and 
seek a set of relationships between the stress resultants and couples that reflects 
the equilibrium of the middle surface. In this derivation, we basically follow the 
approach of Novozhilov,2 which is based on vector algebra. More mathe-
matical approaches based principally on tensor calculus,3 as well as more physi-
cal approaches relying mainly on the free-body diagram and trigonometry,4.S 
are available; in selecting the vector derivation, we hope to achieve an accom-
modation between mathematical elegance and sometimes cumbersome physi-
cal reasoning. The physical interpretation of the resulting equations will be 
explored later for selected geometrical forms. 
The stress resultants and couples on each face of the middle surface element, 
shown in figure 3-2, are combined into stress and stress-couple vectors in figure 
3-4. Also shown is the load vector q. In terms of the stress resultants and couples, 
the resulting vectors are

where q"" qp, and qn are the respective load intensities per unit area of the middle 
surface. Note with respect to equations (3.11c) and (3.lld) that the negative 
signs on the first terms arise because the stress couple vectors were chosen to 
correspond to the positive sense ofthe stresses (see figures 3-1 and 3-2). 
or 
We now apply the equations of static equilibrium 
(3.12a) 
(3.12b) 
Referring to figure 3-4, the force equilibrium equation, (3.12a), becomes 
(F", + F",.",doc -
F",) + (Fp + Fp.pdP - Fp) + qds",dsp = 0 
(3.13) 
Substituting equations (3.lla), (3.11b), and (3.lle) into equation (3.13), and 
dividing through by doc dP, we have 
[(lV",t", + lV",ptp + (2",tn)l1],,,, + [(lVp",t", + lVptp + (2ptn)ff],p 
(3.14) 
+ (q",t", + qptp + qntn)ffl1 = 0 
The differentiations indicated in equation (3.14) are carried out in a straight-
forward manner using equation (2.17) to evaluate the derivatives of the unit 
tangent vectors. The resulting vector equations may be factored into the form 
F",t", + Fptp + Fntn = 0 
(3.15) 
Since the unit tangent vectors are independent, equation (3.15) can only be 
satisfied if 
F", = 0; 
Fp = 0; 
Fn = 0 
which gives the three scalar equations of force equilibrium

The individual terms in equations (3.17a-c) will be interpreted in section 3.3 
for the shell of revolution geometry. However, note that there is considerable 
coupling of the equations; e.g., Nil. appears in Fp and F" as well as in Frz as 
expected. This coupling is due to two general sources: (a) the curvature of the 
surface; and, (b) the possibility that the Lame parameters A and B vary with 
both O!: and fJ. 
If, for example, A = A(/X) and B = B(fJ) only, several of the coupling terms 
drop out. This emphasizes the importance of choosing the curvilinear coor-
dinates so as to achieve the simplest mathematical formulation consistent with 
the problem. 
The moment equilibrium equation, (3.12b), is evaluated about axes through 
point 0 in figure 3-4. 
1. First, we have the contributions of the stress couple vectors 
Crz + Crz,rzdO!: -
Crz + Cp + Cp,pdfJ - Cp 
or from equations (3.11c) and (3.11d), 
[( -Mrzptrz + Mrztp)BJ,rz dO!: dfJ + [( -Mptrz + Mprztp)AJ,pd/XdfJ 
(3.18a) 
(3.18b) 
2. Next, we investigate the contributions of the stress resultants. Observe in 
equation (3.18b) that the stress couple terms are of second differential order, 
dO!: dfJ, so that terms of third or higher differential order will drop out in the 
limit. From figure 3-2, we see that the extensional stress resultants Nil. and 
Np contribute moments about t" of 
- Nil., II. dO!: dsp d~p t" --+ third order 
and 
Np,p dfJ dsrz d~rz t" --+ third order 
and the in-plane shear stress resultants Nrzp and Nprz give 
Nrzp dsp dsrz t" --+ second order 
and 
- Nprz dsrz dsp t" --+ second order 
The transverse shear stress resultant Qrz contributes 
- Qrz dsp dsrz tp --+ second order 
about tp whereas Qp gives 
Qp dsrz dsp til. --+ second order

about t". Collecting the second order contributions of the stress vector to 
moment equilibrium, we have 
(3.19) 
3. Then, we note from figure 3-4 that the contribution of q is of third differential 
order and therefore negligible. 
4. Finally, we expand equation (3.18b) in accordance with equation (2.17), 
combine the resulting terms with equation (3.19), factor in terms of the unit 
vectors, and divide by dcx dP, giving 
G"t" + Gptp + Gntn = 0 
which is satisfied if and only if 
G" = 0; 
Gp = 0; 
Gn = 0 
Thus, we have the three scalar equations of moment equilibrium 
G" = -(BM"p),,, -
(AMp),p -
B,,,Mp,, + A,pM" + QpAB = 0 
Gp = (BM"),,, + (AMp,,),p + A,pM"p -

Q"AB = O. 
(3.20) 
(3.21) 
(3.22a) 
(3.22b) 
(3.22c) 
The set of six equations of static equilibrium, equations (3.17a-c) and 
(3.22a-c), may immediately be reduced to five, since it is easily shown by the 
substitution of equations (3.6)-(3.9) into equation (3.22c) that the later equation, 
commonly known as the sixth equation of equilibrium, is satisfied identically if 
the symmetry of the stress tensor (lp" = (l"p is invoked. 2 Thus, equation (3.22c) 
may be disregarded, although we may mention it from time to time. There are 
several modified shell theories which attempt to redefine the stress resultants 
and couples so that the sixth equation can be satisfied in the form of equation 
(3.22c).6 None of these alters the fact that the sixth equation is identically 
satisfied using a proposition from a higher theory, the theory of elasticity, and 
consequently cannot be germane in any further development. Therefore, five 
equilibrium equations in ten unknowns remain. Such a problem is classified as 
statically indeterminate, indicating that the solution awaits the introduction of 
additional relationships between the stress resultants and couples, and the 
deformations of the shell. 
3.3 Equilibrium Equations for Shells of Revolution 
3.3.1 Specialization of General Equations: The shell of revolution is a widely

the physical interpretation of the equilibrium equations.

3 Equilibrium 
For the shell of revolution shown in figure 2-11, we set ex = rjJ and f3 = O. From 
equations (2.44b) and (2.43b), A = R,p(rjJ) and B = Ro(rjJ) = Re(rjJ) sin rjJ. Also, 
recall the Gauss-Codazzi condition, equation (2.47), which gives 
B,a = Ro,,p = (Re sin rjJ),,p = R,p cos rjJ

we have retained terms of second differential order only. Also, for the differential 
element, sindtPI2 = dtPl2, sindOl2 = d012, and cosdtPI2 = cosdOl2 = 1. 
3.3.2 Physical Interpretation of Equilibrium Equations 
3.3.2.1 Force Equilibrium in the tP Direction: Equation (3.24a). The first term 
represents the increment in the force N;Ro dO as tP changes, whereas the second 

66 
3 Equilibrium 
gives the increment in the force N8fJRfJ dr/J with respect to e, as seen on the force 
element in figure 3-6. Since R~ is not a function of e, it is treated as a constant 
in the second term. The third term indicates a contribution of the force N8RfJ dr/J 
to the r/J direction equilibrium and is explained by first referring to view HV1, 
where the radial component 2N8R~dr/Jde/2, which is in the horizontal plane, is 
developed. This radial force is transferred to view MV1 and is further resolved 
in the r/J and n directions, with the r/J component being the third term in equation 
(3.24a). The negative sign indicates that the component acts in the negative r/J 
direction as defined on figure 2-11. The fourth term is the contribution of 
QfJRo de and is substantiated by considering view MV2. The last term is, of 
course, the applied loading. 
3.3.2.2 Force Equilibrium in the e Direction: Equation (3.24b). The first and 
second terms are analogous to the corresponding terms of equation (~.24a) and 
are easily verified on the force element. The third term is the circumferential con-
tribution of force N8~RfJ dr/J and arises because forces N8fJR~ dr/J and N8fJRfJ dr/J + 
(N8~R~dr/J).8de are not parallel to one another, but rather are directed along 
tangents to the meridians at e and e + de, respectively. As shown in figure 3-5, 
the extension of these tangents defines an intersection on the axis of rotation 
at an angle dX, which is expressed as de cos r/J. Therefore, from the force element, 
we ha ve 2N8fJR~ dr/J dX/2 = N8~RfJ cos r/J dr/J de in the t8 direction. The fourth term 
is the contribution ofQ8R~dr/J and is shown in view HV1, whereas the fifth term 
is the applied loading. 
3.3.2.3 Force Equilibrium in the n Direction: Equation (3.24c). The first two 
terms are the increments of the transverse shear resultants QfJ and Q8 in the r/J 
and e directions, respectively, as shown on the force element. The third term 
represents the contribution of force NfJRo de and is obtained by projection in 
view MV2. The fourth term, representing a similar contribution of N8R~ dr/J, is 
the normal projection of the radial force N8RfJ dr/J de in view M V 1. This force 
was introduced previously in connection with the third term in equation (3.24a). 
Both of these normal components are directed in the negative tn direction. The 
fifth term again is the applied loading. 
3.3.2.4 Moment Equilibrium about the tfJ Axis: Equation (3.24d). The first two 
terms of this equation are analogous to the corresponding terms of equation 
(3.24a) and may be verified accordingly on the moment element, noting that 
the increments are directed in the negative tfJ direction. The third term is found 
analogously to the projection of N8RO dr/J on views HV1 and MV1. The fourth 
term is the contribution of the force Q8RfJ dr/J, multiplied by Ro de, as seen on 
the force element. 
3.3.2.5 Moment Equilibrium about the t8 Axis: Equation (3.24e). Again, the first 
three terms are analogous to the force equilibrium equation, (3.24b), with the 

3.5 Nature of the Applied Loading 
67 
third term being opposite in sense to N(Jq,Rq, d</J, as seen from the moment 
element. The last term is the couple Qq,Ro dO Rq, d</J, which is directed along the 
negative t(J direction. 
3.3.2.6 Moment Equilibrium about the tn Axis: Equation (3.24f). The first two 
terms represent the moments of the in-plane shear resultants Nq,(J and N(Jq, about 
the normal tn' The third term is opposite in sense but analogous to the normal 
projection of Nq,Ro d</J on view MV2; the fourth term follows the normal 
projection of N(JRq,d</J on views HVI and MVl. 
3.4 Equilibrium Equations for Plates 
Equations (3.17a-c) and (3.22a-c) may easily be reduced to sufficiently general 
equilibrium equations for medium-thin plates by allowing R" and Rp ..... 00. 
After these simplifications, we have 
[(BN").,, + (ANp,,),p + A,pN"p - B,,,N,J + qaAB = 0 
[(BNap),a + (ANp),p + B,aNpa - A,pNaJ + qpAB = 0 
[(BQa),a + (AQp),pJ + qnAB = 0 
-(BMap),a - (AMp).p - B,aMPa + A,pMa + QpAB = 0 
(BMa),a + (AMpa),p + A,pM"p - B,,,Mp - QaAB = 0 
The last equation becomes an identity. 
(3.25a) 
(3.25b) 
(3.25c) 
(3.25d) 
(3.25e) 
Further simplifications will be made for regular geometries and for bending 
in the absence ofin-plane forces; for now, we note in equations (3.25a-c) that 
the in-plane stress resultants (Na, Np, NaP, Npa) are uncoupled from the stress 
couples (Ma, Mp, MaP' M prz) and the transverse shear stress resultants (Q", Qp). 
This suggests that the plate resists in-plane loading (q", qp) exclusively through 
extensional action and transverse loading (qn) only by flexure. This is an 
important contrast to shell action as demonstrated by equation (3.17c), where 
the in-plane stress resultants provide resistance against transverse loading by 
virtue of the curvature of the shell. 
3.5 Nature of the Applied Loading 
Thus far, we have assumed that the applied loading is expressible as a distributed 
force per unit area of middle surface, with components in the directions of the 
unit vectors. This leaves open the cases of concentrated forces, and distributed 
and concentrated moments. 

68 
3 Equilibrium 
In general, shells are most efficient when the loading is distributed over the 
surface, because-provided certain geometrical and support conditions are 
met-such loading can be resisted primarily by the extensional and in-plane 
shear stress resultants, rather than by the transverse shear stress resultants and 
the bending and twisting stress couples. In addition to the distributed surface 
loading included in the formulation by q, distributed moments about the t¢ 
and t9 axes can easily be accommodated by including appropriate terms in 
equations (3.22a) and (3.22b). Moments about the tn axis, however, are not 
admissible, since the corresponding equilibrium equation, (3.22c), was sup-
pressed. A plate or shell generally offers very great stiffness to twisting about 
the normal, provided rigid body motion is restrained. 
Concentrated forces and moments require special attention in plate and shell 
theory. Often, these loadings produce singular points, in which case admissible 
solutions may be found only away from the point of application of the load. In 
any case, these forces are usually resisted primarily by the transverse shears that 
are directly related to the bending and twisting stress couples. We may view 
concentrated forces and moments as limits of the corresponding distributed 
effect. Consider the area L1a subjected to a uniformly distributed loading of 
intensity p in figure 3-7. We define a concentrated force Pc as 
Pc =

Now consider two concentrated coplanar forces as defined in equation (3.26) 
and shown in figure 3-7(b). The forces Pc are equal in magnitude and opposite 
in direction a distance L1, apart. We define a concentrated moment Mc about 
an axis normal to the plane of the forces as

CHAPTER 4 
Membrane Theory 
4.1 Simplification of the Equilibrium Equations 
We examine the individual terms of the force equilibrium equations, (3. 17a-c), 
and the moment equilibrium equations, (3.22a-c). We see that the equations 
are coupled only through the transverse shear stress resultants, QI% and Qp. If 
we suppose that for a certain class of shells, the stress couples are an order of 
magnitude smaller than the extensional and in-place shear stress resultants, 
we may deduce from equations (3.22a-c) that the transverse shear stress resul-
tants are similarly small and thus may be neglected in the force equilibrium 
equations, (3.17). This implies that the shell may achieve force equilibrium 
through the action of in-plane forces alone. From a physical viewpoint, this 
possibility is evident for the first two equilibrium equations which reflect 
in-plane resistance to in-plane loading, a natural and obvious mechanism. 
On the other hand, the third equilibrium equation refers to the normal direc-
tion, and the possibility of resisting transverse loading with in-plane forces 
alone is not as apparent. It is evident from equation (3.17c) that this mode of 
resistance is possible only if at least one radius of curvature is finite; i.e., RI% 
and/or Rp #- 00. Thus, flat plates are excluded from resisting transverse loading 
in this manner, within the limitations of small deformation theory (assumption 
[2], table 1-1. 
The applications and limitations of this idealized behavior, termed the mem-
brane theory of thin shells, is examined in this chapter for a variety of shell forms. 
At present, it is constructive to consider some ofthe consequences of membrane 
behavior. First, it is quite desirable from a material efficiency standpoint. Recall 
from chapter 1 that structural materials are generally far more efficient in 
extension rather than in flexure. Second, if we introduce an additional simplifi-
cation with respect to the shear stress resultants, 
N"p ~ Np" = S 
(4.1) 
the force equilibrium equations become 
(4.2a)

4.2 Applicability of Membrane Theory 
71 
(4.2b) 
(4.2c) 
In these three equations, there are but three unknowns, Na , Np, and S. Such a 
system is said to be statically determinate and thus independent of compati-
bility or constitutive considerations. Of course, this simplifies the subsequent 
mathematics considerably. The convenient assumption stated in equation 
(4.1) may be easily justified by considering the definition of Nap and Npa as 
given in equations (3.6) and (3.7). Since (Tap = (Tpa because the stress tensor is 
symmetric, NaP and NPa may differ only in the disparity of the terms 1 + 'IRp 
and 1 + 'IRa' respectively. Since 'IRp and (IRa are themselves necessarily small 
in comparison to 1, the difference in Nap and Npa is obviously negligible. Thus, 
the simplification introduced in equation (4.1) is justified apart from other 
considerations. 
Equations (4.2a-c), together with the requisite boundary conditions, con-
stitute the essential components of the membrane theory. Strictly speaking, the 
entire solution includes the evaluation of the displacements as well. This re-
quires the constitutive and compatibility relationships that have not yet been 
developed here. However, just as in the analysis of statically determinate beams 
and frames, the membrane theory displacements may be computed following 
the establishment of the force field with only a few exceptions. 1 Consequently, 
consideration of the membrane theory displacements is deferred until chapter 6. 
4.2 Applicability of Membrane Theory 
The shells for which the membrane theory is applicable fall into two general 
classes: (a) absolutely flexible shells or true membranes, which by virtue of their 
thinness have a negligible bending stiffness; and, (b) shells with finite bending 
stiffnesses which still develop relatively small bending stresses. 2 
Concerning the absolutely flexible shells, there is little question of the domi-
nance of membrane action, provided that the principal stresses remained tensile. 
The presence of compressive stresses in this type of shell would likely cause 
buckling of the membrane. For flexible shells, the requirement of small displace-
ments as stated in assumption [2] of table 1-1 is often not attainable, and the 
equations as developed herein are not applicable without modification. This 
complication notwithstanding, membrane surfaces are widely used for long-
span roofs, as either tentlike or air-supported structures. An unusual example 
of a thin, flexible, curved object to which shell theory has been applied for the 

72 
4 Membrane Theory 
purpose of estimating the stresses present is the human aortic heart valve [figure 
2-8 (q)]. 3 
A wide variety of shells with finite bending rigidities can be designed and 
constructed to resist external loading almost exclusively through membrane 
action. We should recognize that the establishment of the precise bounds of the 
membrane theory requires the consideration of the governing equations of the 
general theory of shells. Rigorously, a valid membrane theory solution must be 
a close approximation to the response that would be computed using the full 
set of shell equations. However, we may make some observations regarding the 
geometry, boundary conditions, and loading generally consistent with membrane 
behavior. 
With respect to the geometry, a continuous curved surface is conducive to 
membrane action. Also recall that the second quadratic form of the theory of 
surfaces, equation (2.28b), contains the principal radii of curvature, and a 
smooth variation of these parameters is essential if equilibrium is to be achieved 
without transverse shears and bending and twisting moments. 
The boundary conditions must be specified with respect to the membrane 
stress resultants, N", Np, and S, or the corresponding displacements, and must 
indicate either a constraint that will fully develop the force on the boundary; a 
release that will enable the shell to displace freely in the corresponding direction; 
or, possibly, a linear combination of both, as in the case of an elastic support. 
Moreover, the boundary should not provide constraints that would develop 
moments and transverse shears. This implies that the ideal boundary must, in 
some cases, permit rotations and transverse displacements while providing 
complete restraint in the plane of the shell. 
A loading that can be resisted by membrane action must be distributed 
over the surface without severe variations or concentrations. In the mem-
brane equilibrium equations, (4.2a-c), concentrated loadings are not admis-
sible. From a physical standpoint, it is apparent that a load normal to and 
concentrated over a small area of the shell surface would be resisted principally 
by transverse shears which, in turn, produce bending, as demonstrated by 
equations (3.22a-c). 
From this brief discussion of the conditions which correspond to ideal 
membrane behavior, it is obvious that to design and construct an actual shell 
that satisfies all of these conditions may be quite difficult. However, even shells 
which do not meet all of the requirements entirely can be built so that mem-
brane action predominates throughout most of the continuum, except for 
localized regions in which the required conditions are violated. In short, many 
shells exhibit basically membrane behavior augmented by locally prominent 
bending action. This is not to say that all shells may be made to act pri-
marily as membranes or that all bending effects are localized, but such be-
havior is a desirable and often attainable result of good design and careful 
construction. 

4.3 Shells of Revolution

4.3 Shells of Revolution 
4.3.1 Specialization of Equilibrium Equations: We now specialize the mem-
brane theory equilibrium equations, (4.2), for the shell of revolution geometry, 
where the curvilinear coordinates are taken as the meridional angle, ifJ, and the 
circumferential angle e. 
With (X = ifJ and f3 = e, A = Rt/J(ifJ) and B = Ro(ifJ) = RIJ sin ifJ as previously 
established in equations (2.44b) and (2.43b). If we make these substitutions into 
equations (4.2a-c) and carry out the differentiations using the Gauss-Codazzi 
condition, equation (2.47), we find 
(4.3a) 
(4.3b) 
Nt/J 
Nil 
Rt/J + RIJ = qn 
(4.3c) 
We immediately note that equations (4.3a-c) are identical to equations (3.24a-c) 
divided through by Rt/JRo, with the bending terms suppressed and the in-plane 
shear stress resultants Nt/JIJ and Nllt/J set equal to S. As such, the physical interpre-
tation of these equations is contained within section 3.3.2. We also observe that 
the third equation, (4.3c), is an algebraic equation. Hence, either Nil or Nt/J may 
be directly eliminated from equations (4.3a) and (4.3b), leaving a second order 
system of partial differential equations to be solved. 
To simplify the solution of the equilibrium equations, it is convenient to 
introduce certain transformations at this stage. Timoshenko and Woinowsky-
Krieger use integrating functions,4 whereas Novozhilov suggests the auxiliary 
variables 5 
(4.4a) 
and 
(4.4b) 
We first solve equation (4.3c) for 
Nil = RII ( qn - :;) 
(4.5) 
and then introduce equations (4.4) and (4.5) into equations (4.3a) and (4.3b) to 
get

Equations (4.6a) and (4.6b) are the transformed membrane theory equilibrium 
equations. Once t/I and'; are determined, Nq, and S follow from equations (4.4a) 
and (4.4b), and N/I may then be calculated from equation (4.5). The subsequent 
combination and the eventual solution of the transformed equilibrium equa-
tions are dependent on the circumferential distribution of the applied surface 
loading. If the loading is distributed uniformly around the circumference, it is 
termed axisymmetric, whereas if the loading is a variable function of e, it is 
obviously nonsymmetric. Each possibility is considered further in the subse-
quent sections. 
4.3.2 Axisymmetrical Loading 
4.3.2.1 Integration of Equilibrium Equations. The case of axisymmetric ally 
loaded shells of revolution is perhaps the most widely studied class of problems 
in the shell literature. From a standpoint of applications, this case is often the 
most important, since it corresponds to gravity loading and internal pressuri-
zation, as well as to many other practical loading situations. 
We may drop the e-dependent terms in equations (4.6a) and (4.6b) to derive 
the uncoupled set of ordinary differential equations 
t/I,q, = (qn cos ifJ - qq, sin ifJ)Rq,R/I sin ifJ 
';,q, = -q/lRq,R~sin2ifJ 
Considering equation (4.7a) and integrating, we get 
t/I(ifJ) = f (qn cos ifJ -
qq, sin ifJ)Rq,R/I sin ifJ difJ 
(4.7a) 
(4.7b) 
(4.8) 
In many cases, an alternate form of equation (4.8) is convenient. We recognize 
that evaluating the integral for a particular shell geometry will produce a single 
integration constant, and that this constant must be determined from a bound-
ary condition on t/I, or on Nq,. We designate the boundary where the condition 
is specified as ifJ = ifJ' and the corresponding boundary condition as t/I(ifJ'). Then, 
equation (4.8) may be written as 
t/I(ifJ) = t/I(ifJ') + fq, (qn cos ifJ - qq, sin ifJ)Rq,R/I sin ifJ difJ 
(4.9) 
q,' 
Of course, at ifJ = ifJ', t/I = IjJ(ifJ') = Nq,(ifJ')R/I(ifJ') sin2 ifJ'. The solution for Nq, fol-
lows from equations (4.4a) and (4.9) as

Then, NIJ is computed from equation (4.5). 
The in-plane shear stress resultant S is completely uncoupled from N,p and 
NIJ, as is apparent from equations (4.7a) and (4.7b). For common axisymmetric 
loading cases, qlJ = 0 and the shear stress is also 0; however, this is not necessarily 
so, since equation (4.7b) may be integrated in an identical fashion to equation 
(4.7a), yielding 
(4.11)

(4.12) 
In equations (4.11) and (4.12), ¢(¢") and S(¢") are the corresponding values of 
the functions specified at the boundary ¢ = ¢". This solution represents a state 
of pure shear produced by a torsional loading. 
In summary, we observe that the membrane theory equilibrium equations 
for axisymmetrically loaded shells of revolution reduce to two uncoupled first 
order ordinary differential equations. This system admits the prescription of 
two boundary conditions, one on the meridional stress resultant N,p' and the 
other on the in-plane shear stress resultant S. 
One special case is worthy of consideration before we turn to the integration 
of equations (4.10) and (4.12) for specific shell geometries. If we consider a closed 
shell as first discussed in section 2.8.2, we have the two possibilities illustrated 
in figure 4-1. As mentioned in chapter 1, the form of domed roofs evolved from 
the smooth to the pointed top in the Renaissance. In case (a), which we will call 
a dome [figures 2-8(i) and (1)], the meridian remains continuous as ¢ and Ro -+ 0; 
whereas in case (b), which may be termed a pointed or ogival shell, ¢ = ¢t at 
Ro = O. If we take the pole angle ¢ = ¢p as the boundary ¢' in equation (4.9), 
where ¢p = 0 for case (a) and ¢p = ¢t for case (b), and evaluate ljJ(¢p), we find 
ljJ(¢p) = N,p(¢p)RIJ(¢p) sin2 ¢p 
= N,p(¢p)Ro(¢p) sin ¢p

For the common case of a dome [figure 4-1(a)], rPp = O. 
We may observe several interesting points about the preceding solutions for 
closed shells: 
1. The pole condition does not necessarily imply that N",(rPp) or S(rPp) = o. 
2. For the case of a dome, rPp = 0, the integrated expressions may produce an 
indeterminate form which must be evaluated by some limiting operation. 
3. Since the available boundary conditions on N", and S are implied by the pole, 
there is no opportunity to specify any further boundary conditions on the 
stress resultants within the membrane theory. This means that to maintain 
equilibrium, the remaining boundary of the shell must develop whatever 
values of the membrane stress resultants that are computed from equations 
(4.14). We recall that such an ideal boundary may not impose constraints 
which will develop bending forces or moments. 
4. For a dome, all meridians meet at the pole, and any direction is parallel to 
one meridian and at right angles to another; that is, the curvilinear coordi-
nates rP and () are interchangeable and indistinguishable. Therefore, R",(O) = 
Re(O) = Rp and, corresponding, Ntfo(O) = Ne(O). Then, from equation (4.3c), 
Rp 
N",(O) = Ne(O) = qn(O)T

Spherical Shell Under Self-Weight Load 
4.3.2.2 Spherical Shells. As the first example, consider the spherical shell illus-
trated in figure 4-2. The shell has radius a, constant thickness h, mass density 
p, and is bound by angles ifJt and ifJb' Initially, the weight of the shell alone, known 
as the self-weight, is taken as the loading condition. 
The principal radii of curvature are the definitive geometric parameters. The 
radius of curvature of the meridian is, of course, the radius of the generating 
circle a. This is easily verified by considering the equation of the meridian 
Z2 + R'5 = a2 and substituting into equation (2.29) with ex; = ifJ and X = Ro. 
With Z,Ro = -Ro/Z and Z,RoRo = -(1/Z)(1 + R'5/Z2), we find 
- [1 + (R'5/z2 )]3/2 
R,p = -(1/Z)[1 + (R'5/Z 2 )] 
= .../(Z2 + R'5) 
=a 
(4. 16a) 
The other principal radius may be computed from equation (2.42). We note 
from figure 4-2 that the horizontal radius Ro = a sin ifJ, so that

Equations (4.16a and b) obviously satisfy the Gauss-Codazzi condition, equa-
tion 2.47. 
Next, consider the applied loading. The self-weight of the shell per unit area 
of the middle surface is given by 
q = pgh 
(4.17) 
in which 9 = the acceleration of gravity. The load q acts vertically, of course. 
The governing equilibrium equations require the loading to be resolved in the 
tP, e, and n directions. Since the vertical load has no component in the circum-
ferential direction, qlJ = O. On the inset in figure 4-2, we have the resolution of 
q into q</l and qn. The signs are established by comparison with the unit vectors 
shown in figure 2-11. 
At present, the boundaries are assumed to satisfy ideal membrane theory 
restrictions. The upper boundary is presumed to be free of stresses and the lower 
boundary is taken to be unyielding in the tP or meridional direction, free to 
displace in the n or normal direction, and unrestrained against rotation about 
an axis along the e or circumferential direction. The base conditions imply that 
the necessary N</I to maintain equilibrium will be developed, but no Q</I or M</I 
can occur. The roller symbol used on the figure corresponds to a similar 
condition in plane structural analysis; however, here the boundary is a space 
curve, and for shells which have circumferential loading, a condition in the e 
direction also must be specified. In the latter instance, the ideal membrane 
boundary must be extended beyond the simple conceptual model of a roller. 
We now substitute the geometry, loading, and boundary conditions into 
equation (4.10). These calculated quantities are R</I = RIJ = a; q</l = qsintP and 
qn = -qcostP· We take tP' = tPt so that N</I(tPt) = O. Then, we have

the integral first, and then going to the limit as <p -. O. 
It is quite instructive to consider equations (4.20) and (4.21) for increasing 
values of <p as shown in figure 4-3, where nondimensional plots for N", and No 
are provided. These graphs actually represent the self-weight stresses for all 
constant thickness spherical domes. For any particular dome for which the 
lower boundary is located by a given value of <Pb' the relevant parts are the 
regions <p ::5; <Pb' A shallow dome (rjJ" « 90°), a hemispherical dome (<Pb = 90°), 
and a deep dome (<Pb > 90°) are illustrated in the insets of the graphs. An 
interesting feature of the graphs is that N", is always negative or compressive, 
whereas No changes from negative to positive. This exact transition point may 
be computed from equation (4.21) as the value of <P satisfying

sion under gravity loading, which is especially desirable for shells constructed 
of concrete. 
' 
With reference to the ancient masonry domes described in chapter 1, the 
necessity for maintaining the entire dome in compression is obvious and is 
apparently reflected in the change from the spherical to the more parabolic 
profile used in the Renaissance. 
The apparent desirability of providing an entirely compressive state of stress 
is countered by another practical consideration. Recall that the support for the 
spherical shell must develop the calculated value of Nt/J at ¢ = ¢b' An idealized 
typical support is shown in figure 4-4(a), where a circumferential ring beam is 
employed to resist the thrust. The shell is assumed to extend to the centroid of 
the ring beam to eliminate the introduction of eccentricity.6 A section through 
the ring beam is shown in the inset. The vertical component of the thrust, 
V = N"'(¢b) sin ¢b' is transmitted to the foundation, whereas the horizontal 
component must be developed by the beam. A half-plan of the ring is shown 
in figure 4-4(b), with a unit length segment in the inset; there, the horizontal 
reaction H = - N",(¢b) cos ¢b is countered by the radial component of the hoop 
tension T. 
We may evaluate T by summing forces in the X direction on figure 4-4(b).

It is clear from comparing equation (4.26) and the graph for NIJ in figure 4-3 
that there will be a strain incompatibility at the junction between the shell and 
ring beam. For ¢b < 51 °49', the hoop stress NIJ is compressive; the ring force 
TDL is tensile for all ¢b < 90°. Thus, the dome, which has been shown to be in 
a state of compression through membrane theory analysis, must somehow 
accommodate the circumferential expansion ofthe base ring accompanying the 
tensile force TDL. Clearly, this cannot be accomplished with membrane action

alone, and bending forces must be considered to satisfy deformational continu-
ity. In the terminology of section 4.2, we have violated the ideal boundary 
conditions. In some instances, such as for the dome shown in figure 2-8(j), 
prestressing of the base ring is effective in reducing the circumferential strain 
incompatibility. In general, the bending effects introduced by this type of 
support are usually confined to a relatively small portion of the shell adjacent 
to the base, and membrane action will still predominate throughout most of 
the shell. It should also be noted that equation (4.23) is not restricted to spherical 
shells, but is valid for all shells of revolution supported in this fashion. 
It is apparent from figure 4-3 that the stresses increase rapidly for deep 
spherical shells with rPb > 120°. For such shells, it is logical to support the shell 
somewhere above the base. Such a situation is depicted in figure 2-8 (t), although 
the description of discrete column supports requires an extension of the ideal 
membrane case, as we will see later. If we have, for example, a complete sphere 
supported by an ideal membrane boundary at an angle rP = rPr as shown in figure 
4-5, we can easily obtain the stress pattern from figure 4-3. For rP s rPr we 
compute the stresses as before. For rP > rP" the lower portion ofthe shell behaves 
just like a spherical cap with a boundary angle rPb = 11: -
rP" and with a loading 
which is just opposite in sense to that shown on figure 4-2, as shown in the inset

of figure 4-5. Thus, if we enter (f = 11: -
¢> for ¢> on figure 4-3, the dead load stress 
resultants for the lower portion of the shell are identical in magnitude but 
opposite in sign to those read from the graph. 
Another common loading condition for spherical domes is that of uniform 
normal pressure. Consider a positive internal pressure p on the spherical dome. 
We substitute R.p = RIJ = a; q.p = 0; qn = P and ¢>p = 0 into equation (4.14a),

A variation on the spherical water tank is the spheroidal shell, figure 2-8(s),

4.3.2.3 Hyperboloidal Shells. As a second illustration of a membrane theory 
solution for an axisymmetrically loaded shell of revolution, we consider the 
form illustrated in figures 4-6 and 2-8(g). This surface is generated by the rota-
tion of a hyperbola of one sheet and is a shell with negative Gaussian curva-
ture, since the centers of curvature corresponding to R.p and RIJ lie on opposite 
sides of the meridian (see section 2.7 and figures 2-6 and 2-11). This form is of 
considerable practical importance, because of the wide use of such shells for 
reinforced concrete hyperbolic cooling towers [figure 2-8(0)]. These massive 
structures may approach a height of 600 ft (183 m), span 300 ft (92 m) in 
diameter, and yet have an average thickness ofless than 9 in (23 cm), a striking 
testimony to the efficiency of thin shell structures.

case of the cylinder, k = 1, with a larger k corresponding to a more pronounced 
curvature of the meridian. As may be seen from equation (4.30), b, and hence 
the geometric profile, can be set independently using specified top or base 
dimensions. For cooling tower applications, it is sometimes desirable to use 
different values of b for the top and bottom, and thus create a compound shell 
with a smooth transition at Z = O. 
With the parameter k defined, we may rewrite equation (4.29) as 
R5 - (k2 -
l)Z2 = a2 
(4.32) 
The next step is to derive expressions for the principal radii of curvature in 
terms of the curvilinear coordinate ,po Direct substitution of the equation of the 
meridian into equation (2.29), as previously done for the spherical shell, leads 
to cumbersome expressions since Z and Ro are not given as explicit functions 
of ,po Instead we consider equation (4.32) along with the expression for the 
differential arc length, equation (2.45a), which becomes for this case, 
ds~ = dZ2 + dR5 
or

We now consider the elementary case of the self-weight. The principal radii

Some further comments are in order regarding the preceding solution for the 
self-weight stress resultants. If the shell thickness changes with the height of the 
shell, the solution as derived must be generalized slightly. Assuming that the 
shell thickness is or may be approximated as piecewise constant within a defined 
subregion of the shell, the basic solution, equation (4.39), may be applied in 
a stepwise fashion. For any subregion r bounded by iP: and iP: as shown in 
figure 4-7, 
r = 1, ... ,n 
and, from equation (4.17), 
qr = pghr 
(4.42a) 
(4.42b) 
where hr is the local constant thickness. We start at the top of the shell, r = 1, 
for which the solution is given by equation (4.40a). Then, we evaluate equation 
(4.40a) at iP = iP; = iP: to compute N,,(iP;) = N,,(iPn which is substituted into 
the first term of equation (4.39). Thus, the solution for region r = 2 is given by

No(,p') is calculated as before from equation (4.41). 
Although the coordinate ,p has proved to be convenient for integrating the 

88 
4 Membrane Theory 
membrane theory equations, it is somewhat awkward for physically locating a 
particular position on the shell. It is obvious that the axial coordinate Z would 
be more meaningful from the standpoint of practical construction. Corre-
sponding to any value of <p, Ro may be computed from equation (4.37), and then 
Z can be found from equation (4.34). Conversely, for a specified Z, Ro is 
computed from equation (4.32), and <p is conveniently obtained by solving 
equation (4.37) for sin <p: 
<p 
. -1 { 
Ro 
} 
= SID 
(a2 + k2(R~ _ a2)]1/2 
(4.44) 
Values of <p in the first and second quadrant correspond to the lower and upper 
portions of the shell, respectively. 
To compute the limits of integration, <Pt and <P .. when the corresponding value 
of Ro, t, and s, are known, equation (4.44) can be used directly. 
For spherical shells, we were able to deduce some general characteristics of 
the response to self-load by making a nondimensional plot of the membrane 
theory stress resultants. It is also useful to attempt such a study for the hyper-
boloidal shell. If we define a nondimensional meridional coordinate 
(4.45) 
and assume the thickness to be constant, we may plot nondimensional mem-
brane stress resultants for various values of k 2, als, and alt. Such a plot is shown 
in figure 4-8 for a shell of typical proportions, alt = 0.90 and als = 0.55. To 
give some idea of the actual size of a corresponding cooling tower with k2 = 
1.18 and a = 70 ft (23 m), the dimensions would be s = 127 ft (39 m), t = 78 ft 
(24 m), S = 258 ft (79 m), and T = 80 ft (25 m) so that the total height is 338 ft 
(104 m). 
From figure 4-8, we see that under self weight load the entire shell is in a 
state of compression, except for a portion above the throat, which has a 
relatively small tensile hoop stress. From the standpoint of reinforced concrete, 
this stress pattern is quite favorable. With respect to the base region, <D = 1.0, 
there are several points to be noted. First, the state of circumferential com-
pression does not match the anticipated tension in the ring support, as previ-
ously illustrated in the discussion of spherical shells. Second, hyperboloidal 
shells which are used in cooling tower applications must have openings at the 
base to allow air to enter. This is accomplished by supporting the shell on an 
annular ring of closely spaced columns, as shown in figure 2-8(p), producing a 
so-called mixed boundary, where the shell may be presumed to have zero 
meridional displacement within the column width and zero meridional stress 
between the columns. The combination of the discrete support and the ring 
beam clearly indicates a boundary far more complex than the idealized mem-
brane theory case. This is considered further in subsequent sections. (Complete

4.3.2.4 Toroidal Shells. The toroidal shell is quite useful and efficient for pres-
sure vessel applications. Also, segments of toroidal shells are frequently used as 
transitions between cylindrical tanks and shallow spherical or flat caps [figure 
2-8(y)]. This type of compound shell will be treated in some depth later. 
Examining the toroidal geometry, figure 4-9, we see that the surface is 
generated by the rotation of a closed curve, usually a circle, about an axis lying 
inside the curve. 
The definitive geometry is conveniently established from figure 4-9. The 
meridian is the circle ABeD, with radius a. If we examine a normal to the surface 
defined by a meridional angle <p, we observe that it pierces the surface at two 
points; that is, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between curvilinear 
coordinate <p and a unique point on the surface. The consequence of this

anomaly is that the segment of the shell within the semicircle BAD must be 
considered separately from that within BCD. 
Considering the exterior segment BAD denoted by the superscript e, 
RZ = bcscf/Je + a 
(4.46) 
where b = the constant distance from the center of the generating circle to the 
axis of rotation. 
The center of curvature of the meridian BAD is on the same side of the 
meridian as the center of curvature of RZ signifying a shell of positive Gaussian 
curvature, so that 
R~= +a 
For the interior segment BCD denoted by the superscript i, 
R~ = b csc f/J i_a 
(4.47) 
(4.48) 
Observe that, for this segment, the center of curvature of the meridian lies on 
the opposite side of the meridian from the center of curvature of R~ , indicating 
that this segment has negative Gaussian curvature. Thus, 
R~ =-a 
(4.49) 

4.3 Shells of Revolution 
91 
At this point, it is appropriate to comment further on the choice of the correct 
algebraic sign of the principal radii of curvature when the magnitudes are 
obtained from a geometric rather than from a mathematical argument, as we 
have done here. Specifically, the condition of negative Gaussian curvature 
implies only that the product I/R,pRo is negative and does not indicate which 
ofthe radii has the negative sign. Also, a shell with positive Gaussian curvature 
may seemingly have both principal radii with negative signs. From the funda-
mental geometrical definition of the shell ofrevolution, figure 2-11, the horizon-
tal radius Ro = Ro sin ¢J is always positive. With sin ¢J remaining positive for 
o ~ ¢J ~ n, Ro and hence Ro will always be positive, and thus the signs on 
equation (4.47) and (4.49) are necessary to give the correct sign for the Gaussian 
curvature. It is easily verified that equations (4.46) and (4.48) satisfy the Gauss-
Codazzi condition. In the toroid, we have encountered a shell which has positive 
Gaussian curvature in one region and negative curvature in the other, with 
transition points at Band D. At Band D, Ro -
00, indicating a zero Gaussian 
curvature condition. 
The most common loading case for toroids is a uniform internal pressure p. 
Referring to figure 2-11, this loading corresponds to the positive sense oftn for 
the positive curvature segment and the negative sense of tn for the negative 
curvature segment. Therefore, for segment BAD, qn = q: = + p, and for seg-
ment BCD, qn = q! = - p. Further, because of symmetry, we may restrict 
our consideration to the quarter-circles AB for e(n/2 ~ ¢Je ~ 0) and BC for 
i(n ~ ¢Ji ~ n/2). We select the indefinite integral form, equation (4.8), for 1/1, 
since this shell does not have an external boundary where 1/1 or N,p is known 
or can be specified a priori. For e, qn = q: = p, Rq, = R~ = + a and Ro = R~ = 
b csc ¢Je + a, so that

At the common points Band D, ,pe = 0 and n, and ,pi = nand 0, respectively, and

Interesting, we see that the circumferential stress resultant Ne throughout the 
shell, as well as the meridional stress resultant N,p at the top and bottom circles, 
are independent of the relative plan size of the torous, as represented by b, and 
are only dependent on the radius of the generating circle a. Also, as the mean 
plan radius b becomes large as compared to a, N3 and N~ --+ pa throughout the 
shell. These observations have rather simple physical interpretations which give 
some insight into the general load resisting characteristics of shells. 
First, to investigate the circumferential stress resultant Ne, we consider the 
half-plan free body as shown in figure 4-10. We have a resultant force of 
magnitude p x [Projected area of outer circle -
Projected area of inner circle], 
acting in the Y direction. From figure 4-9, the difference in the projected 
areas is 4ab + 2(tna2 ) -
[4ab - 2(tna2 )J = 2na2 , or simply twice the cross-
sectional area, so that the resultant force is 2npa2 • This force must be balanced 
by the force in the shell wall arising from Ne. Since the pressure p is con-
stant throughout the cross section, it is reasonable to regard Ne as constant. 
Therefore, 
2Ne(2na) = 2pna2 
or

which verifies equations (4.51) and (4.53). In the next section, we further illus-
trate that equations of overall (as opposed to differential) equilibrium on 
strategically chosen sections of shells can frequently lead to simple solutions 
for the membrane theory stress resultants. 
Next, we seek to interpret the values of Nt/> at the top and bottom circles.

94 
4 Membrane Theory 
In general, we make frequent recourse to equation (4.3c) to interpret the 
results of mathematical analyses from a physical standpoint. This equation, 
which describes the resistance of the shell to transverse loading, is perhaps the 
most incisive single equation in the theory of shells. Moreover, it clearly 
illustrates the basic difference between plate and shell action in terms of the 
influence of the initial curvature of the surface. 
4.3.3 Alternate Formulation for Axisymmetric Loading 
4.3.3.1 Overall Equilibrium. In the previous section, the circumferential stress 
computation for a symmetrically loaded toroidal shell was verified using an 
equation expressing the overall equilibrium across an internal section. This 
procedure is quite efficient in a variety of cases. Consider the general axisym-
metrically loaded shell of revolution shown in figure 4-11 and pass a reference 
section normal to the axis of rotation. The trace of this section on the shell is 
the horizontal circle defined by the meridional angle t/J. 
To maintain equilibrium in the Z direction, the axial component of the 
meridional stress resultant N", multiplied by the circumference of the section 
must balance the resultant axial load above the section, Q(t/J), taken positive in 
the negative Z direction to ensure that a compressive force produces a negative 
meridional stress. 
The axial component of N",(t/J) is given by N",(t/J) sin t/J so that

In terms of the magnitude Q(rP), we find 
(4.58) 
Then, No(rP) is found from equation (4.3c). 
To compute the resultant vertical load Q(rP) when the shell is subject to a 
distributed surface loading, we examine a differential ring element above the 
section. This ring element is defined by the auxiliary meridional angle 1] and 
has a meridional length equal to Rt/J(1])d1]. The distributed surface loading, 
represented by qn and qt/J' contributes axial components + qn(1]) cos 1] and 
- qt/J(1]) sin 1] per unit area of middle surface, respectively, as shown in figure 
4-11. Then 
Q(rP) = ft/J [qn(1]) cos 1] - qt/J(1]) sin 1]J [2nRo(1])J [Rt/J(1]) d1]J 
t/J, 
(4.59) 
which may be directly substituted into equation (4.58) to evaluate Nt/J(rP). 
As an elementary example, we will again solve the spherical dome under 
self-weight load, previously considered in section 4.3.2.2 and illustrated in figure 
4-2. From figure 4-2, we have qn = -qcos1], qt/J = qsin1], Ro = a sin 1], and 
Rt/J = a, so that 
Q(rP) = ft/J (- q COS21] - q sin21])(2na sin 1])a d1]

Fig.4-12 Symmetrically Loaded Cylindrical Shell 
4.3.3.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells. A similar approach may be used for a circu-
lar cylindrical shell subject to an internal pressure p(Z). Consider a unit length 
axial slice of such a cylinder with radius a as shown in figure 4-12(a). In this 
case, the magnitude of the total resultant force along the e = 0 (vertical) axis is 
Q(e) = 2 f: p(Z)cos1J(l)(ad1J) 
= 2p(Z)a sin e 
(4.62a) 
The corresponding component of the circumferential force, which must balance 
Q(O), is 
(4.62b) 
Equating forces, we have 
2N9(O) sin 0 = 2p(Z)a sin 0 
or 
N9 = p(Z)a 
(4.62c) 

4.3 Shells of Revolution 
For a uniform pressure distribution, p(Z) = p and 
N(J=pa 
97 
(4.62d) 
which is, of course, well known from elementary strength of materials. Obvi-
ously, equations (4.62c and d) follow directly from equation (4.3c), since R¢ = 
00. This solution also holds for incomplete or open cylindrical shells, bounded 
at a maximum 8 = ± 8". This type of shell, illustrated in figure 2-8(h), is 
examined in detail in chapter 7. 
We now turn to the computation of the meridional stress resultant. Here, rP 
is not suitable for the meridional coordinate, since rP = nl2 all along the axis. 
Instead, the axial coordinate Z is appropriate. We return to equations (4.2) with 
0( = Z, f3 = 8, A = 1, and B = a. For axisymmetricalloading, equation (4.2b) 
vanishes and equation (4.2c) confirms the result given in equation (4.62c). This 
leaves equation (4.2a), which becomes 
1 -(aNz ) z + qz = ° 
a 
. 
or 
Nz.z = -qz 
so that 
Nz = - f 
qzdZ 
(4.63a) 
We may also write the integral in the alternate form introduced in section 
4.3.2.1. 
Nz(Z) = Nz(O) - LZ qz dZ 
(4.63b) 
Equations (4.63a) and (4.63b) indicate that for a symmetrically loaded cylin-
drical shell, the meridional stress resultant is uncoupled from both the normal 
loading and the circumferential stress resultant and is a function only of the 
axial loading and the boundary conditions. For example, if the shell shown in 
figure 4-12(a) is subjected to a uniform axial edge load N per unit length of 
circumference, as shown in figure 4-12(b), and the pressure qz = 0, then equation 
(4.63b) gives 
Nz(Z) = N = constant 
(4.64) 
so that the effect of the edge load penetrates along the axis of the cylinder and 
must be developed on the opposite boundary. This unattenuated propagation 
of edge loads is quite plausible if one recalls that the cylindrical shells have 
meridians composed of straight lines parallel to such axial loads. A similar 
situation arises in the membrane behavior of shells of negative Gaussian curva-

ture, where tangential edge loads tend to propagate along the straight lines 
on the surface.9 This is illustrated in section 4.4.3.5. 
It is interesting to compare the solutions for the toroidal shell and the 
cylindrical shell under uniform normal pressure loading. For this purpose, the 
coordinates <p and () on the toroid should be regarded as equivalent to () and 
Z, respectively, in the cylinder. Now, if b » a, we find [from equation (4.50) or 
(4.52) for the toroid and equation (4.62d) for the cylinder] that (Nqj)toroid = 
(NO)Cylinder = pa. Furthermore, if the cylindrical shell is closed by a flat circular 
plate, Nz = P x (Area/Circumference) = pa/2, which would match No as com-
puted for the toroid in equations (4.51) and (4.53). Thus, the membrane resis-
tance mechanism of the two geometries is remarkably similar, with the torus 
representing, in effect, a self-closing cylinder. 
4.3.3.3 Conical Shells. We now investigate conical shells and initially examine 
the frustum, as shown in figure 4-13(a). The shell is conveniently described in 
terms of the axial coordinate Z, since the meridional angle <p = n/2 -

Then, we concentrate on the meridional stress resultant Nz .

Assume that the shell is subjected to an internal suction q, and that the top 
is closed by a flat plate which is free to move radially and to rotate freely at the 
junction with the conical shell. The idealized junction detail is shown in 
the inset. Under these conditions, the plate transmits a total force of only 
qnt2 in the + Z direction to the shell. Therefore, the resultant axial force at the 
top is of magnitude 
Ql = -qnt2 
(4.68) 
This force is distributed over the circumference of the top circle, 2nt, providing 
an edge load of intensity qt/2 on the shell, as shown in figure 4-13(b). 
We now want to derive the resultant force Q2(Z) due to the uniform suction. 
We define an auxiliary axial coordinate 11 and resolve the load accordingly.

The complete cone is an illustration of a pointed closed shell, shown in figure 
4-1 (b). In contrast to the dome, which was examined in detail in sections 4.3.2.1 
and 4.3.2.2, Nz and NIJ ~ 0 at the pole. Also, recall that for a closed spherical 
shell under uniform pressure, we found N,p = NIJ throughout; whereas, for the 
closed conical shell, the circumferential stress is double the meridional stress. 
4.3.4 Compound Axisymmetrically Loaded Shells 
4.3.4.1 Transition Segments. We now examine shells which have a meridian 
defined by more than one geometric curve; such combinations may be called 
compound shells. A common usage of this form is for pressure vessels, in which 
a basic cylindrical tube may be capped at each end by a so-called head and 
bottom, which are often shallow spherical shells. Examples of such shells are 
shown in figures 2-8(r, s, and u), and an idealized case is depicted in figure 4-14. 
One's first inclination might be to make the ends hemispherical in order to 
provide a smooth transition; however, such a shell is nondevelopable and is not 
readily formed by bending flat sheet. Rather, it is considerably easier to produce 
a realtively shallow spherical cap by rolling and dishing operations guided by 
suitable templates. 
Turning to the shell shown in figure 4-14 under a positive internal pressure 
p, we find from equations (4.27) and (4.28) that for the spherical segments

(4.74b) 
As far as the meridional stress resultant in the cylindrical shell is concerned, we 
have shown in equation (4.64) that Nz = a constant dependent on the boundary 
value and the axial loading, if present. As shown in the inset of figure 4-14, 
the meridional stress in the sphere imparts an edge force per unit length of 
(pad2) sin <Pl to the cylinder so that 
Nz(Z) = (P;l) sin <Pl 
(4.75) 
We attempt to ascertain the admissibility of the membrane theory solution 
for the compound shell. First, note that the sudden transition between the 
cylindrical and spherical shell is a violation of the geometrical guideline for the 
existence of a membrane state of stress, as discussed in section 4.2. It is rather 
obvious that the radial component of N",(<Pl)' (pad2) cos ,pl' cannot be balanced 
by an extensional force in the cylinder, but will introduce transverse shears and, 
subsequently, bending which will affect both shells. Another result apparent 
from equations (4.74) is that the circumferential or hoop stress resultant N9 will 
likely be different for both shells at the junction. This leads to discontinuities 
in the circumferential strain and the radial deformation, which we cannot 
quantify at this stage of the development but which serve as further evidence 
of the inadequacy of the membrane theory in the junction region. Note that 
even if a complete hemisphere is used for a cap, with a l = a2 = a, 
N() (hemisphere) = P; 
N() (cylinder) = pa 
(4.76a) 
(4.76b) 
so that the circumferential strain discrepancy will still remain, even though the 
unbalanced radial force (paj2) COS,pl vanishes. 
An attractive method of balancing the radial component of the thrust in the 
cap is to provide a ring stiffener or collar at the junction. An example is provided 
by figure 2-8(r), and an idealization is shown in figure 4-15. The ring tension T

in the stiffener can balance the radial thrust in the same manner as a cylindrical 
shell resists normal pressure, so that 2T = (pa 1/2) cos ¢(2a2), with the assump-
tion that w « a2 • The ring, however, will restrain the radial expansion of the 
cylinder, and thus violate the ideal membrane boundary requirements. 
We consider two additional possibilities of providing a smooth transition. 
In figure 4-16(a), we show an ellipsoidal cap; in figure 4-16(b), we insert a 
segment of a toroidal shell between the cylinder and the spherical cap. The latter 
form is sometimes called a torospherical head. 
Considering the ellipsoidal head first, we note that a smooth transition is 
provided between the cylinder and the cap along the meridian, so that trans-
verse shear in the cylinder is not required for radial equilibrium. However, the 
hoop stresses computed for an ellipsoid again do not match those for a cylinder 
as calculated from equation (4.76b)10; thus, an incompatibility in the circum-
ferential strain and subsequent radial deformation occurs, which, as before, 
must be corrected by transverse shears on the cylinder and on the ellipsoid. 
Also, the problem of forming a deep curved cap remains. 
The torospherical head shown in figure 4-16(b) circumvents the deep cap 

104

problem but it turns out that the hoop stresses and the corresponding radial 
deformations, as computed from membrane theory, result in incompatibilities 
at both the cylindrical-toroidal and toroidal-spherical junctions. The toro-
spherical shell will be treated in detail in the following section. 
Meanwhile, we may illustrate an interesting property of compound pressure 
vessels by considering the normal equilibrium equation 
N,p 
No 
R+R=qn 
,p 
0 
(4.3c) 
which was earlier termed the single most incisive equation in thin shell theory. 
We first apply the overall equilibrium approach developed in section 4.3.3.1 to 
the shells shown in figure 4-16, and particularly consider equation (4.61a). At 
any section defined by the coordinate rjJ, Nq,(rjJ) cannot change abruptly as long 
as Ro does not change. With this in mind, we rewrite equation (4.3c) with qn = P 
as 
No = Ro(P - ~;) 
With the foregoing arguments in mind, at a smooth transition 
No =[ -R:,p + pJ 
(4.77) 
Thus, even if the transition is smooth along the meridian and the loading is 
also smooth, a sudden change in Rq, can radically change the magnitude and 
even the algebraic sign of No. Recall that the cylindrical shell in figure 4-16 
resists the pressure p by No/Ro, since R,p is 00. This occurs regardless of the 
magnitude of N,p. Suddenly, at the transition, we encounter a finite value of Rq" 
R,pe for the ellipsoid and a3 for the toroid. Since N,p is positive, equation (4.77) 
reveals that No decreases in proportion to the now finite value of Rq,' even 
perhaps becoming negative. Both of these cases may produce a large negative 
value of the hoop stress resultant NO,ll and such shells may fail because of 
circumferential buckling if proper strengthening and stiffening is not provided. 
An actual case where this occurred is described in Fino and Schneider. 12 The 
shell segment shown in figure 2-8(y) was fabricated to quantify this failure 
mechanism further through an experimental study. 
4.3.4.2 Torospherical Head. In the preceding section, the possibility of insert-
ing a toroidal segment between a spherical cap and a cylindrical shell was 
discussed. The geometry of this shell is shown in more detail in figure 4-17. 
In terms of the radii of curvature of the sphere, a 1, the toroid, a3' and the 
cylinder, a2 , the meridional angle at the sphere-toroid junction is given 
by 
(4.78)

In practice, the radius of the toroid is selected so as to provide smooth 
transitions at both ends. 
To derive the membrane theory stress resultants, we again use the overall 
equilibrium method. At a general section within the toroid, rPI < rP < n12, the 
resultant axial load consists of two parts: QI = the load on the spherical cap, 
and Q2(tP) = the load between rPI and rP on the toroid. For a uniform positive 
pressure p, the magnitude of the first force is the pressure multiplied by the 
projected base area of the cap, 
QI = pn(a l sin tPd2 
(4.79a) 
For the second force, we first compute the horizontal radius of the toroid 
(4.79b) 
whereupon the magnitude equals the pressure multiplied by the area of the 
projected annulus, 
Q2(tP) = pn[R6 - (a l sinrP)2]

Pertinent material properties are Young's modulus E = 30,000 psi and Pois-
son's ratio J.l = 0.3. Equations (4.84) may be used to verify the continuity of 
slopes at the junctions. 
In figure 4-19, the circumferential stress resultant N(J is shown as a function 
of the arc length siP' The change from tension in the spherical cap to compression 
in the torus and again to tension in the cylinder is clearly illustrated. Along 
with N(J, a scale for the extensional component of the circumferential stress, 
G(J(J = N(J/h, is also given to facilitate comparisons with bending theory solutions, 
which are somewhat thickness-dependent. The abrupt jumps are mitigated by 
bending effects, which will be discussed in chapter 9. 
4.3.5 Nonsymmetric Loading 
4.3.5.1 Transformation of Equilibrium Equations. Thus far, we have considered 
the membrane theory analysis of shells of revolution subject to loading that is 
nonvarying with respect to the circumferential coordinate e, so-called sym-
metric loading. The solutions obtained in the previous section are based princi-
pally on equation (4.7a), which is written in terms of the auxiliary variable t/I. 
This equation was obtained by suppressing the e dependence. We now return 
to equations (4.6) and eliminate e by taking alat/J of equation (4.6a); alae of 
equation (4.6b); then taking the difference of the two equations; and finally by 
dividing both sides by the leading term RiPR(J sin t/J, which gives!3

Equation (4.85) is a second order partial differential equation in t/I. Once t/I is 
determined, e may be found by solving equation (4.6a) or (4.6b). 
4.3.5.2 Fourier Series Representation. Since we have a partial differential equa-
tion to solve, we try the standard method of separation of variables. Specifically, 
we apply the Fourier series technique, whereby all loadings and dependent 
variables are taken in the form of Fourier series:

We may treat each equation of the series separately, and then obtain the total 
solution by summing to a suitable truncation limit onj. We recognize that the 
individual equations for each harmonic are ordinary, rather than partial, differ-
ential equations, since the ()-dependent terms may be cancelled. This is, of 
course, a formidable mathematical simplification. Also, we see that equations 
(4.87a) and (4. 87b), withj = 0, reduce to equations (4.7a) and (4.7b), respectively, 
which have previously been investigated with respect to axisymmetric loading. 
Thus, the previous solution for axisymmetric loading, as given by equation (4.8) 
and (4.9), also serves as the solution of the j = 0 harmonic for the non symmetric 
loading situation, with the loading taken as q~ and q~, the j = 0 components 
of the surface loading. These solutions do not include the case of a j = 0 
component of qo which, as mentioned in section 4.3.2.1, is quite rare. This case 
can be accommodated, however, by simply interchanging the sinj() and cosj() 
terms in equations (4.86a-c), obtaining an analogous set of equations to equa-
tions (4.87a-c), and combining the results of the two solutions. 
Since the j = 0 case has already been solved, we now seek a solution to 
equation (4.87c) for a general harmonicj > O. After cancelling the cosj() terms, 
we have for harmonic j

We postpone consideration of the general solution of equation (4.88) until 
further specializations are introduced. For now, note that once IjIi has been 
determined, we may solve for ~i from either equation (4.87a) or (4.87b). Since 
~i occurs as an undifferented term in equation (4.87a), this equation is com-
monly selected. For each harmonic, the stress resultants at any circumferential 
angle may then be computed by evaluating N~ and Si, using equations (4.4), 
and Nj, using equation (4.3c), and then substituting the appropriate value of e 
into equation (4.86b). In passing, note that the "price paid" for the mathematical 
simplification of reducing the partial differential equation to an uncoupled 
series of ordinary differential equations is reflected in the total number of 
harmonic solutions that must be summed to adequately represent the effect of 
the particular surface loading in a given case. Each harmonic solution entails 
a complete analysis of the shell, whereas the partial differential equation, (4.85), 
need be solved only once. In spite of this, the Fourier series approach has been 
widely used to solve shells of revolution subject to unsymmetric loading, 
because it is fundamentally simpler from a mathematical viewpoint. 
The eventual solution of equation (4.88) is strongly dependent on the har-
monic number j. The case j = 1 is called antisymmetric loading and is somewhat 
more tractable than the case j > 1, which will be called asymmetric loading. 
4.3.6 Antisymmetrical Loading

The transformation between equations (4.88) and (4.89b) is most easily verified 
by substituting equation (4.89a) into equation (4.89b) and performing the 
indicated differentiation with the aid of the Gauss-Codazzi relation, equation 
(2.47). 
Equation (4.89b) is in a form which permits 1 to be evaluated by successive 

4.3 Shells of Revolution

integrations with respect to r/J. Then, 1/1 1 is found from equation (4.89a), and the 
remaining auxiliary variables and stress resultants are determined from equa-
tions (4.87a), (4.86a), (4.4a), (4.4b), and (4.5). This procedure is straightforward 
and, since it is discussed in detail in Novozhilov,14 it is not repeated here. 
Rather, we present the results which may be easily verified as a solution by 
direct substitution into the membrane theory equilibrium equations, (4.3a-c).

Then, Ro = 0 and C1 = C2 = O. The more general case, where NtP and S are 
specified at different boundaries, may be treated in an analogous manner. 
To evaluate the stress resultants at the pole of a dome for j = 1, we first 
consider equation (4.90d), with rP' = 0 and C1 = C2 = 0, and recognize that we 
have a % indeterminate form. We apply L'Hospital's rule by differentiating 
the numerator and denominator of equation (4.90d). Noting that

which remains an indeterminate form. Therefore, we must apply L'Hospital's 
rule once more to equation (4.94). Considering the numerator, after cancelling 
sin ,p with Ro = Ro sin ,p, 
(<DRq,),q, = Rq,<D,q, + <DRq"q, 
Since <D(O) = 0, the second term vanishes. Evaluating <D,q,(O), we find that 
this term also vanishes provided q~ (0) = 0, which is a reasonable smoothness 
requirement as will be apparent later. Thus, 
lim (<DRq, sin ,p),q, = 0 + 0 = 0

Differentiating the denominator gives 
2(Rosin,pRq,cos,p),q, + (RoRocos,p),q,

At,p = 0, the second term in equation (4.96) becomes Ro(O)Rq,(O). Considering 
the first term, we have 
2(Rosin,pRq,cos,p),q, = 2[Rq,cos,p(Rq,cos,p) + Rosin,p(Rq,cos,p),q,] 
(4.97) 
As ,p -+ 0, the second term of equation (4.97) also goes to 0, and the first term 
becomes 2R~(0). Thus, we finally conclude that

since C1 = 0 and X(O) = 0 by L'Hospital's rule applied to equation (4.91b). 
Examining equation (4.90e) for Ni as,p -+ 0, the second term goes to 0, and 
the first term remains. Thus, we find 
(4.100) 
In section 4.3.2.1, we proved that Nq,(O) = N(J(O) for a dome. Equation (4.98b) 
indicates that NJ(O) = 0 which, in view of equation (4.100), implies that q~(O)

must be equal to 0 for a properly defined anti symmetric loading. An example 
is presented in the following section. 
Finally, with respect to the general analysis of anti symmetrically loaded shells 
of revolution, note that we have evaluated the constants of integration through 
the consideration of (a) specified values of NJ and Sl at given boundaries for 
open shells; or, (b) pole conditions for domes. It is required that the remaining 
boundary develops the calculated values of Nq, and S to ensure membrane 
action. As illustrated in figure 4-20(a), the displacements corresponding to these 
stress resultants, in the meridional direction for Nq, and in the tangential 
direction for S, must be O. 
Such a set of boundary conditions (meridional and tangential displacements 
equal to 0 on one boundary) are apparently sufficient to ensure membrane 
behavior, provided that the corresponding geometrical and loading restrictions 
are observed. The question arises as to the possibility of specifying an alternate 
set of conditions for an open shell, e.g., meridional displacement equal to 0 on 
one boundary, and circumferential displacement equal to 0 on the other, as 
shown in figure 4-20(b). The study of this possibility requires the consideration 
of pure bending deformations, which are deformations which produce neither 
extension nor in-plane shearing of the middle surface. 
Although a formal study of pure bending deformations is beyond the scope 
of this text, one can show that shells for which this behavior is possible are 
inherently unstable. The requisite circumstances are not primarily a function 
of the applied loading, but are related to the geometrical properties and the 
boundary conditions. Mathematically, one can show that such deformations 
constitute a nontrivial solution to the equations describing the middle surface 
displacement of the shell when the loading terms qq,' qo, and qn are equal to 
0, e.g., a nontrivial homogeneous solution to the equations for the displace-
ments of the middle surface. A closely related configuration, inextensional 
deformation, originally conceived by Lord Rayleigh in his study of the vibra-
tions of cylindrical shells,15 has been used to facilitate instability analysis of 
shells. 
Obviously, the possibility of pure bending deformations in actual structures 
is to be avoided. One can show that a support for which both the meridional 
and circumferential displacements are constrained on one boundary, figure 
4-20(a), is sufficient to prevent pure bending deformations for all shells of 
revolution and is also necessary to remove this possibility for shells with 
negative Gaussian curvature.16 In other words, there are some geometries for 
which a shell with negative Gaussian curvature might exhibit pure bending 
deformations if both the meridional and tangential displacements are not 
prevented at one boundary, as in figure 4-20(b). 
An interesting parable based on an awareness of the possibility of these 
deformations' drastically reducing the stable configuration of lattice structures 
is found in the treatise of V. Z. Vlasov.17 He wrote

Lattice Structure Attributed to Engineer Shukov 
The lattice designs of Engineer Shukov which are well known in construction 
practice, outlined by the surface of a hyperboloid of one sheet and consisting of 
rods arranged in straight lines, forming and tied together in horizontal rings, may 
constitute instantaneously varying unstable systems under certain combinations of 
geometric si2es and types of asymmetrical loads (wind loads, for example). Unless 
such structures are properly reinforced by additional structural elements (for exam-
ple, tension members located in the planes of the rings), they possess very little 
load-bearing capacity." 
A diagram of a type of structure designed by Shukov, although not with 
negative curvature in this case, is shown in figure 4_21. 18

applicable and can often lead to erroneous conclusions, it is expedient. If due 
care is exercised, it can provide an approximation that is adequate for design, 
particularly when the pseudo static loading is developed from consideration of 
the dynamic forces and the response characteristics of the structure. 
With this preface, we show a static wind loading on a spherical dome in figure

(4.102) 
At this point, a word of warning is in order. It is fairly obvious that the 
pseudo static wind loading given on figure 4-22 and in equation (4.101c) has 
been conceived as a reasonable facsimile of a possible pressure distribution to 
fit the antisymmetricalload form, j = 1, and is not necessarily based on mea-
sured dynamic wind pressures. Extreme caution should be exercised in using 
this loading for actual design. In section 4.3.7.5, a spherical shell is analyzed for 
an experimentally determined pressure distribution and quite different results 
are obtained. Nevertheless, the antisymmetrical pressure case is interesting. 
Proceeding with the results for the spherical dome, we have Rt/> = RIJ = a; 
C 1 = C2 = 0; <6' = 0; and q~ = qJ = 0, q" = - p sin <6 substituted into equations 
(4.90) and (4.91). After integration, the solution iS 19

This solution is readily verified by direct substitution in the equilibrium

Equations (4.102) and (4.103) are graphed in non dimensional form on figure 
4-23 for a hemisphere. As discussed earlier with respect to figure 4-3, the graph 
holds as well for spherical domes with <6b < n/2 by considering the portion 
above that ordinate. Two points of special interest on this graph are (a) Sl is 
maximum at <6 = n/2; and, (b) NJ = 0 at <6 = n/2. To provide a physical ex-
planation of these results, we again find the overall equilibrium approach to be 
helpful. The appropriate equilibrium equations, written with respect to the 
X - Y coodinates shown in figure 4-24, are !:Mx = 0 and l:Fy = O. Here, the X 
axis is drawn through the center of curvature and Y is parallel to the as-
sumed direction of the wind. We show the appropriate free-body diagrams 
in figure 4-24, where the positive signs of Nt/> and S are established from 
figure 3-6.

The verification of the stress resultants using the overall equilibrium equa-
tions suggests that these two equations, written with reference to a general 
coordinate ¢, should provide an independent derivation for NJ and S1, where-
upon Nl would be computed, as usual, from equation (4.3c). Note that, in the 
general case, ¢b "# n12, so that N¢ and S would participate in ~Mx = 0, and N¢

the j = 1 case is indeed equivalent to elementary flexure except, of course, that 
theory alone does not admit the computation of the circumferential stress 
resultant N(). The use of beam theory to compute the stresses in antisym-
metrically loaded shells ofrevolution was developed in detail by Popov.20 
4.3.6.3 Rotational Shells under Seismic Loading. Another dynamic force fre-
quently simulated by a static representation is an earthquake or seismic load. 
Records of actual or artificial earthquakes are generally available in the form 
of two horizontal components (N -S) and (E- W), and a vertical component. 
The vertical component is an axisymmetric loading which fits the solution 
developed in section 4.3.2.1. Regarding the horizontal components, it is fre-
quently assumed that they are not in phase; i.e., the peak effects from the two 
directions do not occur at the same instant on the structure. Since shells of 
revolution are axisymmetric in construction, it is here regarded as sufficient to 
consider only the stronger of the two components. The X axis in figure 4-25 is 
presumed to be oriented to this direction. 
From the results of a linear dynamic analysis or from some approximations 
thereto, a total design base shear V may be computed corresponding to the 
strong horizontal motion earthquake component. The base shear is frequently 
written as a percentage C of the dead weight of the structure (e.g., 15% g). 
Details of the computation of V are beyond the scope of this book since the 
dynamic characteristics of the structure must enter into any rational treatment. 
An excellent comprehensive discussion of this subject is given in Clough,21 
and an application to shells of revolution is contained in Gould, Sen, and 
Suryoutomo.22 The remainder of this section is concerned with the determina-
tion of the distribution of surface loading that produces a specified value of the 
base shear V and the evaulation of the corresponding membrane theory stress 
resultants. 
As depicted in figure 4-25, the magnitude of the base shear, V, is equal to the 
total horizontal resultant of N", and S, or 
V = I"" [S(<pb,B)sinB -
N",(<Pb' B)cos <Pb cos B]RO(<Pb) dB 
(4.108a) 
We assume that the base moves uniformly without circumferential distortion, 
so that only the j = 1 harmonic participates. Then, we have 
V = RO(<Pb>[ Sl (<Pb) I~" sin2 B dB -
NJ(<Pb) cos 1>" I~" cos2 B dB] 
= nRO(<Pb) [Sl(<Pb) -
NJ(tA,)COS<Pb] 
(4.108b) 
The subsequent analysis for the membrane theory stress resultants is depen-
dent on the surface loading which produces V. We know that the equivalent 
surface loading should have a resultant in the direction of V; i.e.,

where q = qtx is defined in equation (3.11e). Since V is assumed to act in the 
horizontal plane, at any level q acts in the horizontal plane and is parallel to 
the assumed strong direction of the earthquake, indicated here by the X axis. 
Referring to figure 4-26(b), we see that q(tP) has a circumferential component of

view, figure 4-26(a), the radial component, q(¢) cos 0, is projected from the lower 
figure and resolved into a meridional component, qt/J cos 0 cos ¢, and a normal 
component, q(¢) cos 0 sin ¢. Thus. referring to figure 3-6 for the correct signs, 
we have

qn = -q(¢)sin¢cosO 
(4. 110a)

qJ = q(¢)

It remains to determine the meridional variation of q, q(t/J), so that equation 
(4.109) is satisfied. 
Consider a cooling tower structure in the form of a hyperboloid of revolution 
as illustrated in figure 4-27. An actual cooling tower is shown in figure 2-8(0). 
First, we relate the total base shear magnitude V to the total shell weight W. 
Following the overall equilibrium method, 
(4.111a) 
where N¢(,p,,) is due to self-weight load. Substituting equation (4.40a) and (4.37) 
into equation (4.111a), 
W = 2nqDLa2 ['1(,p,,) - 'l(t/Jt)] 
(4.111b) 
where '1 is defined in equation (4.40b). Then, 
or 
V 
C=-

V=CW 
(4. 112a) 
(4. 112b) 
Either C or V is assumed to be specified by consideration of the dynamic 
characteristics of the system, as described, for example, in Clough.21 Note also 
that equation (4.111) may be useful for calculating the total weight of a tower 
of given dimensions. 
Now, we refer to some characteristics of the linear dynamic response of the 
shell in harmonic j = 1. We can show that this response can be represented as 
a linear combination of the longitudinal modes offree vibration,23 and that the 
first mode is the most important for the seismic analysis. The first mode normal 
displacement for a tower of typical dimensions is shown in figure 4-27. Keeping 
in mind that the total base shear V is presumed to be known, the actual 
magnitude of the normal displacement is not needed for this discussion; 
what is important here is the shape. The inertial forces produced by a har-
monic response are, in fact, proportional to the mode shape. This follows from 
D'Alembert's principle. Thus, it is reasonable to try to arrive at a distribution 
of the base shear V which resembles the dynamic deflected shape. Of course, 
the actual longitudinal response is a combination of the participating modes 
and is an ever-changing function of time; the best we can attempt with a static 
approach is a one-term approximation at a given time, and this is reasonably 
selected as the first mode shape. Thus, we shall try to arrive at a distribution 
q(t/J), which has a shape similar to the first mode of the normal displacement. 
The most common distribution used for shell design has been to assume that 
the seismic load is everywhere proportional to the gravity load, or 
q(t/J) = CqDL 
(4.113) 
This is referred to as the Mass (M) distribution on figure 4-27 and the compo-

nents are computed by substituting equation (4.113) into (4.110). It is obvious 
from the figure that this distribution does not realistically represent the first 
mode shape. 
Another possibility, frequently adopted in the analysis of tall building struc-
tures, is to assume that the load is distributed in proportion to the weight and 
the height of each element of the structure above the base. We refer to this as 
the mass-height (MH) distribution on the figure. This distribution has been 
adapted to cooling towers by the author.24 To derive this shape, we refer to a 
differential element dE, which is located at a distance E = S + Z above the base, 
as shown on figure 4-27. E is thus an axial coordinate measured from the base. 
The surface loading acting on the differential element dE, which represents the 
appropriate portion ofthe base shear V computed by equation (4.109), is given 
by 
(4.114) 
where W is given by equation (4.111). Then, F(E) is divided by the differential 
area 
A(E) = 2nRo(E) dE 
(4.115) 
to get q(E) = F(E)/A(E).The resulting expression is easily transformed into a 
function of rP 
(4.116) 
through equation (4.34). (1 is a constant defined in Appendix 4A. From the 
graph of the MH distribution, it is obvious that this appears to be far more 
realistic than the M distribution when compared to the mode shape. 
A third possibility may be included, whereby the shear is distributed accord-
ing to the weight and the square of the height of each element above the base. 
This is termed the mass-height2 (MH2) distribution. Following the same proce-
dure, we geeS 
(4.117) 
where (2 is a constant defined in the Appendix 4A. From the graph, we see that 
perhaps the MH2 distribution is even a better approximation than the MH. 
The components of surface load for each of the assumed distributions may 
be substituted into equations (4.90), (4.91), and (4.92) to evaluate the stress 
resultants, as has been done in various publications. Since the results are not 
readily available in collected form, the pertinent formulae are summarized in 
Appendix 4A. All quantities are nondimensionalized and are tersely presented 
in a form suitable for computer input preparation. Tabulated results for a wide 
range of tower dimensions are also available for the M distribution.26

Effect of Base Shear Distribution on the Meridional Stress Resultant for a Hyper-
boloidal Shell 
Although the detailed derivation of the various solutions are probably of 
interest only to the specialist, it is instructive to look at a comparative study of 
the stress resultants. In figure 4-28, we show the nondimensional meridional 
stress resultant n~ = NJ /(qDLa) for a shell of typical proportions using the three 
proposed distributions. Also shown is the negative of the dead-load stress 
resultant, equation (4.40a), suitably nondimensionalized. When the seismic load 
graph falls to the right of the dead load graph, this indicates a net tension at 
() = 0 due to the combined loading. It is for this net tension that a concrete shell 
should be reinforced. 
Also, it is appropriate to note here that the designer should be very careful 
when considering combined lateral and gravity loading which produces a net 
tension situation. Each loading should be factored by an appropriate amount 
prior to combining effects with opposite signs. For example, consider figure 4-28 
at Z/a = -1.0, where N~DL) = - 2.5 and NJ(MH) = 3.3. Using load factors from 
a standard code,27 

130 
4 Membrane Theory 
N~NET) = 1.3(3.3) - 0.9(2.5) = 2.04 
An alternative (not recommended) would be to apply a factor of safety to the 
net stress. For example, using a nominal factor of safety of 1.5, 
N~NET) = 1.5(3.3 - 2.5) = 1.20 
It is apparent that the latter procedure can lead to unconservative results when 
the lateral and dead load stresses are close in magnitude but opposite in sign. 
4.3.7 Asymmetrical Loading 
4.3.7.1 Integration of Equations. The analysis of shells of revolution for har-
monicsj> 1 is quite different from thej = 0 andj = 1 cases. Whereas there are 
a relative abundance of quadrature solutions available for the symmetric and 
antisymmetric loading cases, this is not the case for asymmetric loading; the 
governing equation, equation (4.88), is not solvable in general terms but, rather, 
whatever solutions that exist are dependent on some special form of the variable 
coefficients. 
At this point, recall that the j = 0 and j = 1 solutions were directly related 
to and derivable from static equations of overall equilibrium. The j = ° 
solu-
tion represents force equilibrium parallel to the axis of rotation, whereas the 
j = 1 case reflects equilibrium of forces normal to the axis and equilibrium of 
moments about the axis of overturning. In contrast,j > 1 does not correspond 
to any equation of overall equilibrium. All loading cases for j > 1 are said to 
be self-equilibrated with respect to the overall equilibrium of the shell. Thus, 
the differential equations offer the most promising approach. One should note 
at the outset (and it is demonstrated in subsequent sections) that the membrane 
theory stress resultants in shells of revolution may be very sensitive to the 
influence of the higher harmonic components of the surface loading, and that 
shells which are subject to such loading must be investigated very thoroughly. 
4.3.7.2 Spherical Shell with Edge Loading. One specific geometry that can be 
solved for j > 1 is the spherical shell. We limit our investigation to the case of 
no surface loading, which produces a homogeneous set of equations. This form 
is sufficient to describe an important practical situation, the edge-loaded shell 
of revolution. Once a homogeneous solution is available, a particular solution 
for a given surface loading is easily obtained using the standard method of 
variation of parameters. 
It is expedient to return to the original untransformed membrane equations, 
equation (4.3). We introduce the separated form of the stress resultants, equa-
tion (4.86b), for harmonic j into these equations. Noting that equation (4.3c) 
gives N(J = - N", since qn = 0, we have

In these equations, ¢/ and ¢/' denote the respective boundaries of the spherical 
shell where N¢ and S are specified. Also, the form of equation (4.123) indicates 
that N¢ and S may both be designated at the same boundary-e.g., ¢/ = ¢l" in 
equation (4.124)-or that N¢ or S, alone, may be chosen at both boundaries. 
In any case, only two boundary conditions are available, and the computed 
values of N¢ and/or S at the other boundaries must be developed by the support 
in order for the solution to remain valid. 
For a spherical dome, cot(¢l/2) ~ 00 at the pole, so that Ci = 0 and only one 
condition, N¢ or S, may be specified on the lower boundary. 
4.3.7.3 Shell of Revolution Supported on Columns. It is frequently necessary to 
provide interruptions at the base of a shell above the ground for functional 
reasons. One obvious possibility is to support the shell on a series of con-
centrically placed columns, figures 2-8(p, t, u). This obviously introduces an 
interruption in the continuous, nondeforming boundary required to maintain 
membrane action and suggests that the stress pattern, particularly in the vicinity 
of the support, may be severely altered. 
A fairly common approach is to analyze the shell by a superposition tech-
nique as shown in figure 4-29. In what follows, the discussion is restricted to 
axisymmetric loading and membrane theory to introduce the concept expedi-
tiously, but this type of model has been generalized for nonsymmetric loading 
and bending effects as well. 29 Also, here the columns are assumed to be equi-
spaced around the circumference, and the axis of the column is taken to be 
tangent to the meridian at the boundary ¢l = ¢lb' For columns oriented vertically, 
the same theory can be applied with some minor modifications. 
We now consider the superposition in figure 4-29 in detail. We assume that 
the axisymmetrical surface loading q is carried equally by the nc equispaced 
columns. As shown in figure 4-29(a), the column reaction Rc is taken to be 
uniformly distributed over the column width We> so that the intensity of the 
reaction per unit length of circumference Rei is Rc/wc. Loading case (a) is 
represented by the superposition of cases (b) and (c). Case (b) is the familiar 
axisymmetric loading case previously studied in great detail in sections 4.3.2 
and 4.3.3. The continuous boundary meridional stress resultant at ¢l = ¢lb is 
denoted by N¢(b) (fjJ,,). Case (c) has an edge loading applied along ¢l = ¢lb' It 
consists of (i) the negative of the continuous boundary reaction from (b) in the 
region between the columns; and, (ii) the difference between the column reaction 
and the continuous boundary reaction within the column width. Since case (b) 
is readily solvable, the remaining problem is to address case (c). 
First, we evaluate the column reaction in terms of the known meridional 
stress resultant from the continuous boundary analysis, case (b), as

The limits on b are set presuming an even number of columns and can be 
adjusted accordingly for an odd number, and N,p(e) is taken as positive in the 
positive sense of N,p(b). 
We expand N,p(e) in a Fourier series similar to equation (4. 124a),

This is an example of cyclic symmetry for rotational shells. 
We now turn to the spherical shell treated in section 4.3.7.2 as an example 
of a column supported shell. An actual case is shown in figure 2-8(t). If the shell 
is not a dome, there are two constants of integration to be evaluated. We have 
already specified Nq,(tPb), and since we cannot provide an ideal condition because 
of the columns, the lower boundary must develop the corresponding value of 
S(tPb). This leaves us the option of specifying Nq,(tPt) or S(tPt), and Nq,(tPt) = 0 is 
probably the more realistic choice. Thus, we must provide suitable resistance 
to S at both boundaries in the case of the open shell, or at the base in the case 
of a dome. This can be accomplished with a circumferentially stiff edge member. 
For our example, we chose a hemispherical dome supported on four columns 
as shown in figure 4-30, subject to dead load q. From equation (4.20), the 
solution for case (b) of the superposition is 
-qa 
Nq,(b) = 1 + cos tP

in view of equations (4.20) and (4.21). Again, we stress that the value of S = Sc 
computed from equation (4.141c) must be developed at the lower boundary. 
To study the characteristics ofthis solution, we show the nondimensionalized 
stress resultants for the hemisphere in figure 4-30. The half angle f3 is taken as 
5°; N,p and No are graphed at () = 0°, the center line of the column; and S is 
shown at () = 30°. The series converges rather slowly with about 14 terms 
(n = 56) required to compute, within 1%, the known value of N,p at the base, 
[360° /(4 x 2 x 5°)] N,pb(¢Jb)' or 9 times the continuous boundary reaction. The 
continuous boundary stress resultants, which correspond to figure 4-29(b) and 
are available from figure 4-3, are superimposed and shaded to indicate the 
penetration of the discontinuous boundary reaction amplification into the 
shell. 
Although we have obtained a convergent membrane theory solution for the 
spherical dome supported on columns, all shells with concentrated edge effects 
are not able to sustain such loading in this way. Only a limited number of 
specific geometries have been investigated, and no general proof is offered; 
however, it appears that the attenuation of concentrated meridional edge effects 
through principally membrane action occurs only in positive curvature shells. 
Physically, it can be surmised that the straight characteristic lines present on 
zero- and negative-curvature shells offer a path for the propagation of the edge 
effect to the opposite boundaries, unless bending distortions occur. 
While the quantification of bending effects is beyond the scope of this chapter, 
we may expect that the shell may have to be strengthened to provide adequate 
resistance. In concrete shells, the bending stresses are conveniently resisted by 
local thickening. The wall thicknesses of the shells shown in figure 2-8(g) and 
(p) are approximately equal to the column depth near the base and are gradually 
reduced away from this region. For metal shells, thickening alone may not be 
sufficient to provide an economical solution, since buckling in the region of 
high compressive stresses must be considered. Auxiliary stiffeners, such as the 
ring beam shown in figure 2-8(u), are one possibility. Another configuration 
used for bin structures is to provide full-height columns, along with eave and 
transition ring beams, as shown in figure 4_31.30 
Rotter has proposed a membrane theory solution for the case ofaxisym-
metrical loaded bins, based on the cyclic symmetry of the structure. 30 As shown 
in figure 4-32, the shell is loaded locally by a normal pressure qn(Z) = Pn(Z) and 
a wall friction loading qz(Z) = JLPn(Z), where the normal pressure Pn(Z) and the 
friction coefficient JL are determined from the properties of the material. Con-
tainments for solids differ markedly from liquid storage tanks with the addi-
tional need to provide resistance to the wall friction loading from the solids. 
These forces may be amplified during drawdown and should be considered 
carefully be the designer. 31 
Also acting are the self-load of the cylindrical shell qz = q = Wd(2naL),

and a circumferential line load qz(O) = W2 /(2na), where W2 = the superimposed 
vertical load at the top of the cylinder, Z =.0. Note that Nz(O) = - qz(O). 
The vertical load in the shell wall is transferred into the adjacent column by 
the in-plane shear stress resultant, S. By symmetry, S = 0 along the meridian 
equidistant between two columns. Assuming S to be uniform along the column 
and to vary linearly in the circumferential direction, we have

This implies that the total load is uniformly transferred into the columns along 
the length L. 
The circumferential stress resultant is easily found from equation (4.3c) as 
(4. 142b) 
For the meridional stress resultant, Nz(Z), we follow the overall equilibrium 
approach, section 4.3.3.1. We have the resultant force from the weight of 
the shell above the section Z, W1 (Z/L); the resultant force from the super-
imposed vertical load, Wz; the resultant force from the frictional loading, 
2naJ-l J~ Pn(Z) dZ; and the total force in the columns, W(Z/L). Substituting into 
equation (4.58) and recalling that a resultant axial load in the negative Z 
direction is taken as positive, we have 
(4. 142c) 
At the top of the panel, Z = 0, Nz is due to only the superimposed load Wz; at 
the bottom of the panel, Z = L, the stress is proportional to the difference of 
the weight of the contents and the frictional load on the wall. 
Just as in the case of a spherical shell supported on columns, the ring beams 
must resist the shear force S(8) applied around the circumference, probably 
eccentric to the axis. This is examined in greater detail by Rotter. 3o The shell 
thickness must be adequate to resist buckling due to the maximum principal 
compressive stresses produced by S(O), N9(L), and Nz(L), which probably occurs 
near the intersection of the shell, the column, and the transition ring beam. 
4.3.7.4 Cylindrical Shell Under Circuniferentially Varying Normal Pressure. 
Consider a circumferentially varying normal pressure p(O) on a cylindrical shell. 
This could simulate a pseudostatic wind loading on a cylindrical tower, as 
shown in figure 4-33. The circumferential variation of the pressure would 
generally be established through field measurements or wind tunnel tests. For 
this example, p is taken as constant with respect to Z, but a variation with Z 
may be treated by a simple extension of the following development. 
We follow a procedure suggested in Rish and Steel. 32 It is convenient to 
return to the membrane theory equations in terms of curvilinear coordinates IX 
and p, equations (4.2). We take IX = Z, P = 0; A = 1, B = a, Ra = 00, Rp = a; 
qa = qp = 0, and qn = - p(O). Then, we have

(4. 143c) 
Because these equations are relatively simple, we are able to treat the partial 
differential equation form directly rather than to introduce separated variables. 
However, we later find it convenient to represent the integrated solution in 
terms of the separated variables. 
Proceeding from equation (4.143c), we have 
Ne(Z,O) = - p(O)a 
(4.144) 
Next, we take V/VO of equation (4.144), substitute into equation (4.143b), and 
integrate to get 
S(Z, 0) = p(O),eZ + 11 (0) 

142

With a stress-free top edge, S(O, 0) = 0; therefore, 11 (0) = ° 
and 
S(Z,O) = P(O),6Z

Finally, we take iJliJO of equation (4.145), substitute into equation (4. 143a), and 
integrate once more to obtain

These very simple expressions for the stress resultants for a general harmonic 
j offer a rare insight into the interesting properties of the higher harmonic 
components. Consider, for example, the solution expressed by equations (4.148) 
and (4.149) contrasted with a solution for the resultant lateral force and over-
turning moment found by elementary beam theory: 
1. The circumferential stress resultant N6 is not computable by beam theory. 
2. The shear stress resultant is linearly proportional to the axial coordinate Z, 
just as in beam theory. However, the shell solution shows that S is also 
proportional to the harmonic number j. This discrepancy, of course, increases 
in proportion to the contribution of the higher harmonics. 
3. The meridional stress resultant is proportional to the square of the axial 
coordinate by either theory; however, the shell solution reveals that Nz is 
also proportional to j2, indicating that the meridional stress resultant is 
highly sensitive to the higher harmonic components. 

4.3 Shells of Revolution 
143 
To help put these observations in perspective, note two characteristics of the 
circumferential normal pressure distribution p(O): 
1. High harmonic number components of p(O) results from distributions of the 
pressure that vary rapidly around the circumference. To a point, the more 
rapid the fluctuations, the greater relative participation of the higher har-
monics. However, the case of extremely rapid fluctuations associated with 
large values of j would be tempered by the physical limitations of accom-
panying significant amplitudes. That is, the pi values would usually tend to 
diminish as j becomes very large. 
2. Harmonic components j = 0 and j > 1 do not contribute to the resultant 
lateral force or overturning moment on the shell. Only j = 1 affects these 
resultants. If the meridian were curved, the j = 0 component would influence 
the axial force equilibrium, but thej > 1 components are always self-equilib-
rated with respect to the overall equilibrium of the shell. 
As an illustration, consider the cylinder shown in figure 4-33 subject to the 
pressure distribution shown in figure 4-34. This loading was derived from

measurements taken from a wind tunnel experiment32 and is representative of 
the circumferential pressure distribution on large cylindrical and hyperboloidal 
towers with a roughened surface. The Fourier coefficients for this distribution 
are also shown on the figure. The loading is given in terms of pressure coeffi-
cients multiplied by a reference pressure Pro which is generally a function of 
geographical location, terrain, exposure, and height; it is usually taken as the 
stagnation pressure of the wind (1/2)p V 2, where p is the mass density and V is 
the velocity of the wind. The 0.524 increase shown on figure 4-34 is due to 
internal suction, generally fairly constant around the circumference. The maxi-
mum external suction, however, has been found to be a function of the angle 
where flow separation occurs, which, in turn, is dependent on the surface 
roughness. The value here at () = 72.5°,0.69 + 0.52 or about 1.2 Pr without the 
internal suction, is characteristic of rough towers, whereas a peak approaching 
3.0 Pr is theoretically possible for smooth towers. Roughness in the form of 
vertical ribs is often built into cooling tower shells to reduce the suction33 [see 
figure 2-8(0)]. 
For simplicity, Pr is taken as unity here, and also as constant with height. A 
stepwise variation in Pr is easily handled by applying the solution, equations 
(4.143) through (4.149), in a piecewise fashion as detailed in section 4.3.2.3. 
We focus the computation on the meridional stress Nz at () = 0 for the base, 
Z = H. With Pr = 1.0, equations (4.148) and (4.149) give 
H2 
00 
Nz(H,O) = 2a i~O j2 pi 
(4.150) 
for the Fourier coefficients shown on figure 4-34. Summing for harmonics 0 to 
12, we get 
H2 
Nz(H, 0) = 5.42-
2a 
(4.151) 
Now, for comparison, we evaluate Nz(H, 0) from beam theory. Since only the 
first harmonic contributes to the resultant force per unit height R y , we have 
Ry = f~" pl cos ()(a d()) cos () 
= plan 
and the bending moment is

Since we are considering the stress resultant that acts on the circular middle 
surface line, we compute Nz using the familiar linear stress formula Nz = Mza/ 
Ix, where Ix is the moment of inertia of a circle of radius a about a diameter, 
na3. Thus, we have

Comparing equations (4.153) and (4.151) clearly illustrates the sensitivity of Nz 
to the higher harmonic components. This emphasizes the practical importance 
of obtaining realistic circumferential pressure distributions on tower-type 
structures. 
The perhaps unexpected sensitivity of Nl and Si to the harmonic number j 
and the resulting large departure from the values that might be anticipated from 
elementary beam theory are clearly demonstrated in the preceding solution. 
From a physical standpoint, it is instructive to consider a "slice-beam" model 
proposed by Brissoulis and Pecknold.34 On figure 4-35 a longitudinal slice 
bounded by the meridians (J = ±(n/2j) and loaded by a normal pressure is 
shown. At the section Z = L, the loading p(Z, 8) produces a bending moment 
about an axis parallel to the chord of the circular sector cross-section of the 
slice beam. The applied moment is resisted by a couple consisting of (a) the 
resultant of the meridional stresses Nl(L) cosj8 acting within the depth of the 
beam cross section, a[1 -
cos(n/2j)]; and, (b) the accumulated shearing force, 
It Si(Z) dZ, acting along both edges of the slice. As the harmonic number j 
increases, the depth of the slice beam and, hence, the available internal lever 
arm decreases. Likewise, the resultant transverse component of p(Z, 8) from 
Z = 0 to Z = L must be resisted by a similar component of the resultant of 
Si(L,8) acting on the sector cross section, which is shortening as j increases. 
Therefore, asj increases, both Nl and Si must increase proportionally to balance 
both the applied bending moment and transverse force. This model has been 
quantified by Gould to verify equations (4.148) and (4. 149)?5 
Although some additional resistance may be provided by meridional bending 

146 
4 Membrane Theory 
and transverse shear, the cantilevered "slice-beam" appears to reveal the essen-
tials of the resisting mechanism of cylindrical-type shells subject to normal 
pressures with substantial (i.e., significantj > 1 content) circumferential fluctua-
tion. In addition, Brissoulis and Pecknold suggested that the basic beam could 
be generalized into a "propped-cantilever," with the reaction at the free end 
representing the effect of a ring stiffener or a roof. 34 
4.3.7.5 Spherical Shell Under Measured Pseudostatic Wind Pressure. The sepa-
rated flow pattern for wind acting on a cylindrical shell, figure 4-34, can also 
be expected to occur on spherical shells, but is more complex since the flow 
moves over as well as around the body. A set of pressure coefficients from a 
wind tunnel test of a truncated sphere is shown on figure 4-36(a). It is apparent 
that separation occurs both meridionally and circumferentially, with external 
suction acting over most of the surface. 
Each curve in figure 4-36(a) would require a set of Fourier coefficients to be 
properly represented. This would complicate the harmonic-by-harmonic solu-
tion of equation (4.88), requiring the shell to be divided into meridional seg-
ments within which the Fourier coefficients for the loading could be taken as 
constant. Ultimately, this produces a step-by-step solution to an initial value 
problem starting at the free edge, which is similar to the procedure for variable 
thickness shells discussed in section 4.3.2.3 and illustrated on figure 4-7. 
In such cases, much of the efficiency of the harmonic superposition method 
is lost, and it may become attractive to consider the partial differential equations 
(4.3) in the variables rP and O. This approach requires only one solution over 
the surface, but must usually be accomplished by a numerical method such as 
finite differences. The curves for N", and No shown in figure 4-36(b) were obtained 
by Bellworthy and Croll36 in that way. 
It is of interest to compare these results with those presented on figure 4-23 
for the anti symmetric loading. The latter values are scaled by 0.9 to correspond 
to the pressure coefficient at rP = 90°, 0 = 0° on figure 4-36(a), and are plotted 
on figure 4-36(b). Any similarity between the curves is probably coincidental. 
However, it might be fortuitous for thin metal shells, which are susceptible to 
buckling and may have been designed for an antisymmetric pressure distribu-
tion, that the more realistic loading produces conservative values for the maxi-
mum negative hoop stress. 
As in the previous section, the importance of establishing a realistic distri-
bution of wind pressure on the shell surface is apparent. 
4.3.7.6 Hyperboloidal Shells Under Wind Loading. As mentioned previously, 
analytical solutions to the membrane theory equations for j > 1 are only 
available for isolated cases. As a means of demonstrating a possible approach 
to the general solution of equation (4.88), and also of describing a problem with 
considerable practical utility, consider the hyperboloidal shell of revolution, 
figure 4-6, subject to the normal wind pressure shown in figure 4-34.

The solutions for harmonicsj = 0 andj = 1 are obtained in identical fashion

respectively. They are available in Lee and Gould. 37 
For the casej > 1, a different approach is required. We begin with equation 
(4.88) and differentiate the first term on each side using the product rule. The 
resulting equation is 
r/I,tf>tf> + Xl(,p)r/I,tf> + X2(,p)I/I = X3(,p)

The expansion in equations (4.155) and (4.156) has been retained in a general 
form to point out that we are confronted with a second order linear differential 
equation with variable coefficients. It is obvious from equations (4.156a) and 
(4.156b) that the variable coefficients may be very complicated expressions for 
many surfaces. 
A strategy for dealing with such an equation is suggested in Novozhilov.38 
The technique involves a straightforward elimination of the first order term r/I,tf> 
through the introduction of an additional auxiliary variable, and also another 
less obvious transformation on the independent variable,p. The resulting equa-
tion has the form 
(4.157) 
in which If! and 11 are the transformed variables, and X4(,p) is the appropriately 
modified r.h.s. The detaiis of the transformation are left to the cited references; 
here, we examine the remaining variable coefficient p in more detail. The 
coefficient is a very involved function of the geometry and harmonic number j 
and is given in Lee and Gould37 in terms of a new function, Xs, as 
(4.158)

The remaining solution procedure is outlined as follows: 
1. Expand [p(,B)]2 in a Fourier cosine series in ,B

[p(,B)]2 = I

k=l 
and substitute into equation (4.157).

(4.159) 
2. The equation is now in the form of Hill's equation, which is solved using 
techniques described in Hill, and also in Whittaker and Watson. 39 The 
solution is in the form of a rapidly converging infinite series. From a histor-
ical viewpoint, it is interesting to note that this equation was first studied by 
the noted astronomer, G. W. Hill, with reference to the motion of the lunar 
perigee, which is the point of the orbit of the moon that is nearest to the earth. 
3. Using the solution derived in (2), the original stress resultant variables are 
recovered through the various transformations. 
4. Through some numerical studies using the rather involved series solution 
obtained from Hill's technique, a very close approximation was found by 
considering only one term k = 0, of the Fourier series expansion for [p(,B)2], 
i.e., rxo.40 In effect, this reduces equation (4.157) to a second order linear 
differential equation with a constant coefficient. With the coefficient [p(,B)]2 
replaced by the constant rxO in equation (4.157), the equation is easily solvable 
in terms of elementary trigonometric functions. 
A comprehensive set of tables for hyperboloidal shells with the general 
properties of hyperbolic cooling towers that are subject to the wind loading 
shown in figure 4-34 is given in Lee and Gould. 37 
The solution for a hyperbolic cooling tower exhibits similar characteristics 
to those previously observed for the cylindrical shell under wind loading. In 
particular, two points should be reemphasized: 
1. The solution is very sensitive to the harmonic number j. 
2. The wind load stresses are opposite in sign to the gravity load stresses, and 
the net stresses, critical for design, should be calculated using proper load 
factors. The sensitivity of the cooling tower to the net tension is similar to 
the combined seismic-gravity loadings discussed in section 4.3.6.3 and illus-
trated on figure 4-28. 
4.3.7.7 Commentary. The preceding example indicates that the solution to the 
j > 1 case may be quite complicated for other than cylindrical, spherical, and, 
perhaps, conical geometries. The transformation to the Hill's equation form has 
apparently only been investigated for the hyperboloidal shell and may be useful 
for other geometries as well. Also, the hyperboloidal shell under wind load has 
been solved in the partial differential equation form, similar to that used for the 
cylindrical shell in section 4.3.7.4, as opposed to the harmonic decomposition 
approach stressed here.41 
The investigation of a doubly curved shell for asymmetric loading probably 
approaches the limit to which analytical solutions are efficiently employed. 

4.4 Shells of Translation 
151 
Computer-based numerical techniques have been used extensively for rota-
tional shell analyses,42 but the independent check of selected cases, with such 
analytical solutions that are available, serves to establish confidence in the 
numerical procedures. Also, note that a comprehensive collection of analytical 
solutions to rotational shell problems has been compiled in a semi tabular form 
by Baker et a1.43 and provide a valuable resource for the design engineer. 
In addition to illuminating some of the difficulties encountered in solving an 
unsymmetrically loaded shell of revolution, equation (4.155) also provides a 
good basis for discussing a widely used and apparently logical approximate 
solution technique for such shells. That is, to replace the meridian with a 
combination of cylindrical, conical, and spherical segments, all of which can be 
solved for the general harmonic. Although this approach seems reasonable 
when comparing corresponding coordinates along the meridian, it should be 
noted that the definitive geometric parameters present in equations (4.156), 
most notably RIP' are not necessarily approximated closely by these simpler 
curves. With mathematically based, computer-implemented solution techni-
ques now available for such problems, it is recommended that ad hoc substitute 
curve procedures not be relied upon. 
4.4 Shells of Translation 
A surface of translation may be generated by passing one plane curve over 
another. The translational shell is often treated separately from the rotational 
shell, especially in a theoretical context; however, there may be considerable 
overlap. For example, zero-curvature shells of revolution, such as cylinders and 
cones, may be formed by the translation of a straight line over a circle, or, in 
the case of the cylinder, by the translation of the circle along the straight line. 
Even the negative curvature hyperboloid of revolution may be produced by the 
trace of a skewed line around a circle. In the context of shell analysis, it is 
generally simpler to regard shells as rotational rather than translational sur-
faces when .there is a choice. Therefore, in our subsequent treatment, we are 
only concerned with shells that do not posses rotational symmetry. 
A popular use of the translational shell is to provide a roof without interior 
supports over what can be a quite large plan area. Some notable examples are 
shown in figures 2-8. As can be seen from figures 2-8(a) and (b), such shells are 
often supported at only a few points to provide an uninterrupted open space. 
Because of the wide variety of boundary conditions encountered, we may find 
that the membrane theory solution, by itself, is a poor approximation to the 
stress distribution in such a shell, and that bending effects will play an important 
or even dominant role in the design. The bending analysis of translational shells 
is discussed in chapter 9. 
Further, we find it convenient to separate the membrane analysis of transla-

152 
4 Membrane Theory 
tional shells into two parts: (a) circular cylindrical shells; and, (b) shells of double 
curvature. 
4.4.1 Circular Cylindrical Shells: Single or multiple circular cylindrical shells 
have been widely employed in barrel shell roofs, such as that illustrated in figure 
2-8(h). Extensive discussions of this application are available.44 Here, we con-
centrate on the basic features of such shells. 
The geometry is defined in figure 4-37. We have attempted to remain consis-
tent with section 4.3.3.2 and figure 4-12. An exception is the adoption of X 
rather than Z as the axial coordinate to conform to the prevalent practice in 
the literature. Thus, we have at: = X, f3 = (); A = 1, B = a, and Rrz = 00, Rp = a. 
The shell is bounded by the two arcs at X = 0 and X = L, and the two straight 
edges at () = ± (}k' 
We start from the membrane theory equilibrium equations, (4.2), with the 
appropriate geometric parameters inserted:

Nx x + -S (J + qx(X, 8) = 0

a'

1 
S x + - N(J (J + q(J(X, ()) = 0 
, 
a' 
(4. 160b) 
(4. 160c) 
If we compare equations (4.160a-c) with equations (4.143), we find that they 
are identical except for the loading terms. 
As such, with reference to section 4.3.7.4, the equations are readily solved to 
give 
N(J(X, (}) = qna 
(4.161a) 
S(X,(}) = - f ~N(J,(JdX - f q(JdX + fl((}) 
(4.161b) 
Nx(X,(}) = -~ f 
S,(JdX - f 
qx dX + f2((}) 
(4.161c) 
As an elementary example, we consider a circumferentially uniform but 
axially varying gravity load qd(X), as shown in figure 4-37: 
qx(X,(}) = 0 
q(J(X, (}) = qd(X) sin () 
qn(X, (}) = - qAX) cos () 
Proceeding, we find

Finally, we evaluate the stress resultants, equations (4.161a-c), for both a 
uniform dead load qd = constant, and for the first term approximation of qd as 
given by equation (4. 165b). We proceed with the integration from the boundary 
X = 0, and assume that the shell is simply supported; e.g., Nx(O) = Nx(L) = O. 
For qd(X) = qd = constant, we have from equations (4. 163b) and (4. 163c)

It is interesting to compare the stress resultants computed from the actual 
loading qd with those evaluated from the single term Fourier approximation. 
Note the maximum stress resultants S(O), Nx(L/2), and N(J(L/2), as shown in 
table 4-1. From this comparison we see that except for S (0), the maximum stress 
resultants are conservatively computed from the one term solution. If further 
refinement is desired, additional terms of the series may be included.45 
An interesting aspect of this solution was the enforcement of the symmetry 
boundary condition, S(L/2) = O. In general, the appropriate boundary con-
ditions, in addition to Nx(O) = Nx(L) = 0, would be constraints which can 
develop the shear stress resultant S at the supports. 
For this problem, the end point values of S are easily found from either 
equation (4. 167a) or equation (4. 169a) as

If the symmetry situation was not recognized or enforced, the appropriate

4.4 Shells of Translation 
157 
The direct application of the later constraints creates a statically indeter-
minate membrane theory problem, since the stress resultants cannot be evalu-
ated without consideration of the displacements. This is discussed further in 
section 6.3.4.1. 
Another case of practical interest is that of a load acting in the Z direction 
and uniformly distributed in the Y direction, quo The resolution of this load is 
shown in figure 4-37. 
qx(X,e) = 0 
q/J(X, e) = qu cos e sin e 
qn(X, e) = - qu cos2 () 
(4.171a) 
(4. 171b) 
(4.171c) 
A parallel set of solutions for the stress resultants, using both the actual loading 
and the Fourier series approximation, can be derived in a straightforward 
manner. 
When the load qu is uniformly distributed in the X direction as well, it is then 
constant over the X - Y plane. This form is commonly used to represent snow 
loading on a shell roof. 
We now inquire into the accuracy of the membrane theory stress analysis for 
a barrel shell. Obviously, the cases we have discussed thus far satisfy the 
requirements of smooth loading and regular geometry. When it comes to the 
adequacy of the physical boundaries to meet the requirements ofthe membrane 
theory, however, we need a closer examination. 
The transverse boundaries at X = 0 and X = L have been assumed to be 
simply supported, implying that Nx should vanish. Moreover, our analysis 
indicates that the maximum value of S must be developed there, as shown by 
equations (4.170). These conditions suggest the use of a diaphragm that is 
perfectly flexible in the X, or longitudinal direction, but infinitely rigid in the 
e, or circumferential direction. A typical practical solution is shown in figure 
2-8(h), where a slight overhang beyond the diaphragm is also provided. In 
general, the membrane theory condition is considered to be fairly well approxi-
mated by such a support. 
Now we examine the longitudinal boundaries at e = ± ()k' The solution 
requires N/J(ek ) and S(ek ), as evaluated from equations (4.167) or (4.169), to be 
developed on the boundary. Furthermore, the boundary must be free to dis-
place in the normal direction so that no transverse shear will develop. In 
practice, several situations are found. 46 Two are illustrated in figure 2-8(h), 
where the outer edge is free and the interior edges are continuous with the 
adjacent barrel, but unrestrained in the vertical direction. Also, supplementary 
stiffening beams have been employed in some structures. However, unless a 
continuous support, such as a bearing wall or a stiff frame, is provided beneath 
all longitudinal edges, there will be a serious violation of the membrane theory 
conditions and a resulting drastic alteration of the load-resisting mechanism. 
This situation is easily understood by reference to figure 4-39, where we can 

158

Longitudinal Boundary Conditions for Cylindrical Shells 
see that the membrane theory solution implies that the shell resists transverse 
loading primarily as a series of circular arches. In contrast, where supports are 
not provided along the edge, the shell must resist transverse loading primarily 
by flexural action in the longitudinal direction. Because the stress resultant Nx 
must develop the required longitudinal resisting couple at any section, the value 
computed from membrane theory will be considerably altered by bending, as 
we will see in chapter 9. Since the contribution of N(J( ± lU in resisting the 
vertical load will be lost, the vertical equilibrium must be provided by S(O) and 
S(L). From these heuristic observations, we may anticipate a significant read-
justment of all in-plane stress resultants, as well as the possible addition of 
significant bending moments and transverse shear forces from the solution of 
the general equations for open cylindrical shells. 
4.4.2 Shells of Double Curvature: If we refer to the shell element shown in the 
center of figure 4-40, the membrane theory equilibrium equations may be 
directly written from equations (4.2a-c) by selecting the arc lengths as the 
curvilinear coordinates. Therefore, we have IX = Sx and f3 = sy- However, a 
somewhat different approach is widely used because it simplifies the subsequent 
mathematics.47,48 First, we choose the Cartesian coordinate system X - Y-Z as 
shown on the figure. Then, the differential area element dsx dsy located at 
Z(X, Y) is mapped onto the lower element dXdY in the X-Y plane. Also, a 
shorthand notation for the incremental change of stress resultants is introduced 
on the figure: Nx+ = Nx + Nx,xdx, etc. 
Projected stress resultants Nx, Ny, and SXY are defined, such that the X - Y 
components of the resulting forces on the edges dsx or dsy are equal to the total

Now, we derive the equilibrium equations for the mapped element. After 
solving for the projected stress resultants, the actual membrane resultants are 
recovered from equations (4. 174a-c). Since SXy = S from equation (4. 174c), we 
drop the subscript on this term. 
Summing forces in the X and Y directions, we have 
(Nx + Nx.xdX)dY - NxdY + (S + S,ydY)dX - SdX + qxdX dY = 0 
or 
Nx,x + S,y + qx = 0 
(4.175a) 
and 
Ny,y + S,x + qy = 0 
(4.175b) 
To form the third equilibrium equation, we project onto the plane the Z 
components of the forces corresponding to the actual stress resultants, as shown 
on the top element in figure 4-40.

Summing the projected forces in the Z direction,

It is convenient to expand and rearrange equation (4.177) as

Z,xxNx + 2Z,xyS + Z,yyNy + Z,x(Nx,x + S,y) 
(4.178) 
+ Z,y(Ny,y + S,x) + qz = 0 
We then replace the terms in parentheses in equation (4.178) by qx and qy from 
equations (4. 17Sa) and (4. 175b), leaving 
(4.179) 
as the third equilibrium equation. 
We now introduce the Pucher stress function $l',49 which is defined such that 
/F,yy = Nx + f 
qx dX 
(4. 180a) 
/F,xx = Ny + f qydY 
(4. 180b) 
-/F,XY = S 
(4.18Oc) 
It is easily verified by substitution that if $l' is a continuous function with 
continuous partial derivatives, equations (4,175a) and (4.175b) are identically 
satisfied. Therefore, the membrane theory stress analysis for shells of double 
curvature reduces to the single equation

(4.181) 
The mapping onto the X - Y plane, and the subsequent introduction of the 
Pucher stress function, has produced a single equation which encompasses 
a large class of shells. Once the stress function Ji' is evaluated, the projected 
stress resultants are computed from equation (4.180), and the actual resultants 
from equation (4.174). The mathematical complications in solving equation 
(4.181) for a given geometry, and the resulting properties of the solution, are 
dependent on the type of the surface equation Z(X, Y)-e.g., elliptic, hyper-
bolic, or parabolic-and the complexity of the applied loading, qx, qy, and qz, 
as specified in the Cartesian coordinate system. 
For the purposes of illustrating the Pucher stress function technique, we 
consider three representative surfaces encountered quite often in shell roof 
structures: (a) hyperbolic paraboloid, (b) elliptic paraboloid, and (c) conoid. 
4.4.3 Hyperbolic Paraboloids 
4.4.3.1 Surface Properties. The hyperbolic paraboloid (HP) is perhaps the most 
fascinating of the translational shells. The basic form is generated by passing a 
convex parabola over a concave parabola, producing an anticlastic surface, as 
shown in figure 4-41. For obvious reasons, such a hyperbolic paraboloid is 
commonly referred to as a "saddle" shell.

4.4 Shells of Translation 
163 
The equation of the surface shown in figure 4-41 is 
(4.182) 
We observe that the hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface of negative Gaussian 
curvature. This is easily verified from equation (2.38) with Z.xx = 2(cx/a2), 
Z.yy = -2(cy/b2) and Z.Xy = 0, from which the discriminant 0 = Z.xxZ,Yf-
(Z.xy)2 < O. 
The stress analysis of the basic form of the hyperbolic paraboloid shown in 
figure 4-41 is postponed so that we can first consider a more common configura-
tion. We observe from figure 4-41 that the surface has negative Gaussian 
curvature. Referring to the classification in figure 2-7, we expect that there 
should be two sets of straight lines on the surface. Mathematically, these families 
of straight lines are called the real characteristics. In order to arrive at the 
equations for the characteristics, we use a construction suggested by Billing-
ton. 50 
First, we pass an arbitrary vertical plane through the shell. This plane 
intersects the X - Y plane along the straight line 
X = a 1 -
(::) Y 
(4.183) 
shown as a dashed line in figure 4-41. In equation (4.183), a 1 and blare the 
intercepts of the line on the X and Yaxes, respectively, and -adb 1 is the slope 
of the line. Next, we locate the intersection of the vertical plane with the shell 
surface. Since the X - Y projection of the intersection is the straight line given 
by equation (4.183), we substitute the latter equation into equation (4.182) to 
get the Z coordinate of the intersection of the plane and the surface as a function 
of Y: 
(4.184) 
Equation (4.184) describes a straight line if the coefficient of y2 vanishes, which 
occurs when 
a1 = + [(cy/b2)]1/2 
b1 
-
(cx/a2 ) 
(4.185) 
Recalling that (-adbd is the slope of the projection of the intersection onto 
the X - Y plane, the families of straight lines on the surface are defined by those 
vertical planes intersecting the X - Y plane which produce traces with slopes 
given by the r.h.s. of equation (4.185). Finally, we substitute the computed 
(adb 1 ), equation (4.185), into the equation of the intersection with the surface, 
equation (4.184), to get the equations of the families of straight lines, or charac-
teristics

Through any point on the surface pass two characteristics. To identify the 
straight lines passing through a given point (X, Y), we substitute, X, Y and 
equation (4.185) into equation (4.183) and find 
_ _ - _ [(C y /b2)]1/2 _ 
a l -
X + (cx/a 2 ) 
y 
(4.187) 
Then, each of the computed values of al is substituted into equation (4.186) to 
obtain the equations of the intersecting straight lines. 
Now that we have identified two families of intersecting straight lines on the 
surface, a new possibility arises. Instead of visualizing the shell as produced by 
the translation of one parabola over another, why not generate the shell by the 
translation of one or the other of the sets of straight lines? Correspondingly, we 
could choose our reference coordinates to coincide with a pair of the straight 
lines. This is especially attractive if the boundaries of the shell coincide with 
these straight lines. 
To explore this possibility in terms of our previous equations, we restrict our 
discussion to a hyperbolic paraboloid with a square plan-form, for which b = a 
and Cx = Cy = c. Then, the slopes ofthe straight lines on the surface in the X - Y 
plane are computed from equation (4.185) as 
(:J = ±1 
(4.188) 
Therefore, the families of straight lines are orthogonal. and we can define a new 
coordinate system X - Y at 45° from the X - Y system, as shown in figure 4-42. 
The more general transformation is treated in Billington. 51 
The relationship between the original X - Y coordinates and a new pair 
rotated 45° is easily derived from figure 4-42: 
X = X cos 45 - Y sin 45 
y = X sin 45 + Y cos 45 
which, upon substitution into equation (4.182), gives 
Z = c2 [X2 cos2 45 + ji'2 sin2 45 - 2XYcos45 sin 45 
a 
(4.189) 
(4.190) 
Now, we choose new boundaries for the surface that are parallel to the straight 
lines, instead of to the parabolas. These are indicated by dashed lines on figure

We show a quadrant of the hyperbolic paraboloid defined by equation (4.191) 
in figure 4-43. W may visualize this surface as being formed by a straight line 
parallel to the X axis, called a generator, translated between the two straight 
lines OJ and KG, known as directrices, where point G has been displaced 
vertically a distance - c from K in the Z direction. This construction produces 
a warped hyperbolic paraboloidal surface with straight boundaries. 
Hyperbolic paraboloids of this general form have become a symbol of grace 
and elegance in architectural applications of thin shell roofs. Popularized by F. 
Candela in Mexico,52 several examples of actual shells are shown in figures 
2-8(a- e). A noteworthy construction feature ofthis surface is that the formwork 
for reinforced concrete shells may be fabricated entirely from straight pieces.

Various combinations of four quadrants, similar to those shown in figure 4-43, 
are depicted in figure 4-44. These basic forms are referred to freely in the ensuing 
discussion. In turn, these units may be combined into larger roofs, such as the 
multiple saddles in figures 2-8(a) and (e). 
4.4.3.2 Stresses in HP Shell with Straight Boundaries. Now, we proceed to the 
stress analysis. We rewrite the governing equation for the Pucher stress func-
tion, equation (4.181), to match the X-Y coordinate system:

= -qz + Z.-fqf + Z,Hi + Z.ii f

with equations (4.180) correspondingly redefined. Then, from equation (4.191), 
Z.i = kY 
Z,f = kX 
Z,ii = 0

Now, referring to equation (4. 180c), we see that

__ 
-Ji',Xy = S = 2k( -qz + kXqy + kYqx) 
(4.194) 
Note that there are no terms in S that can be affected by the boundary 
conditions. Rather, the boundaries of the shell are required to develop the 
computed values at X = d or Y = d. 
We now proceed with the solution of equation (4.193) for $'. First, we take 
a/ax and integrate with respect to f, giving

Ji',xx = - 2k

Ji',yy = - 21k f 
[-qz,y + k(Xqy + Yqx),y] dX + 12(Y) 
= Nx + f 
qx dX 
(4.196) 
From equations (4.194), (4.195), and (4.196), we may write explicit expressions 
for the projected stress resultants, and then evaluate the actual stress resultants 
from equation (4.174), with X and Y replaced by X and f. The functions of 
integration, 11 (X) and 12(Y)' can then be determined from the specified bound-
ary conditions along X = ± d and Y = ± d. 
Frequently, when the hyperbolic paraboloid is used as a roof and subjected 
principally to a distributed vertical loading, further assumptions are justified. 
A first step is to consider only the Z component of loading, which greatly sim-
plifies the integrals in equations (4.195) and (4.196). A further step is to assume 
that the remaining load qz is constant and uniformly distributed over the pro-
jected surface. If this is the case, equations (4.194), (4.195), and (4.196) reduce to 
and 
S = -qz 
2k 
Ny = 11 (X) 
Nx = 12(Y) 
(4.197) 
(4.198a) 
(4. 198b) 
Referring to figure 4-43, if the boundary X = 0 or X = d is assumed to be 
stress-free in the X direction [Nx(O, Y) = 0 or Nx(d, Y) = 0], then as Y varies 
along that boundary, Nx = 12(Y) = O. Similarly, a free boundary at Y = 0 or 
Y = d gives 11 (X) = 0, so that the expressions for the stresses on the hyperbolic 

4.4 Shells of Translation 
169 
paraboloid simplify to 
(4.199) 
and 
Nx = Ny = 0 
(4.200) 
where x and yare curvilinear coordinates on the shell surface corresponding 
to X and Y on the projected surface. 
A loading of the form qz = constant is frequently termed live load and is often 
taken to represent snow loading, as discussed for cylindrical shells in section 
4.4.1. For shells that are relatively shallow, a uniform distribution for qz may 
also be used to approximate the dead load closely. If a uniform load approxi-
mation is used for the dead load, an equivalent value qz should be computed 
by dividing the total shell weight by the plan area. This will ensure that overall 
statics will not be violated. 
We now reflect on the remarkably simple stress distribution found for a 
uniform load on a hyperbolic paraboloid. Equations (4.199) and (4.200) indicate 
a state of pure shear in the shell. To compute S, it is necessary only to evaluate 
k = -cjd 2 and divide qz by 2k. In designers' jargon, this is termed a "back of 
the envelope" calculation. But, one should not be deceived by the apparent 
simplicity of the mathematics. We must inquire further into the physical 
boundary conditions which have to be provided to sustain the shell in this 
simple-to-calculate state of stress. 
As an example, consider a uniform load qz = - Pu, constant per unit area of 
projected surface, acting on the umbrella shell shown in figure 4-44(a). The shell 
is shown in detail in figure 4-45, where the four segments are numbered. From 
equation (4.199) and figure 4-45, k = -c/d 2 and 
S = -(-Pu) = -Pud2 
-2(c/d 2 ) 
2c 
(4.201) 
The sense of S corresponding to the negative value in equation (4.201) is 
obtained by referring to figure 4-40, and is shown in figure 4-45(a). An enlarged 
view of quadrant 1 is shown in figure 4-45(b), with the shell proper separated 
from the edges OJ, JG, GK, and KO. Clearly, the uniform shear S must be 
developed by axially loaded edge members along each of these lines. Edge OJ 
is subject to a tensile force T(Y), which increases from 0 at point 0 to a 
maximum value of T(d) = Sd at J, where it is balanced by an equal tension 
coming from the edge member of adjacent quadrant 2. An identical tensile force 
is present along edge OK. The situation along the interior edge members JG 
and KG is somewhat different. Considering JG, the compression C(X) contri-
buted from quadrant 1 builds from 0 at J to a maximum of S.j(d 2 + c2 ) at G. 
Adjacent quadrant 2 contributes an identical force, so the maximum com-

pression C(d) = 2S.J(d2 + c2). An identical situation occurs along KG and the 
other two interior edge members. Although the horizontal component of the 
maximum compression at G for each interior edge member, C(d)[d/.J(d2 + c2)], 
is balanced by the similar component from the opposite interior edge member, 

4.4 Shells of Translation

the vertical components of these four forces, 4C(d) [e/.j(d 2 + e2)], is trans-
mitted through the column to the foundation. Of course, the total vertical force 
4[2S.j(d 2 + e2)] [e/.j(d 2 + e2)] = 8Se should balance the total applied load 
4Pud2. From equation (4.201), 
8Pud2e 
8Se =

2e 
u 
(4.202) 
We observe from figure 4-45(c) that the compressive forces flow naturally to 
the support. Also note that the internal self-balancing of the maximum tensile 
forces and the horizontal components of the maximum compressive forces 
occurs only if the dimensions and loading are identical for the four seg-
ments. Any unbalanced loading will produce a resultant shear and overturning 
moment, which would have to be resisted by the single column. For this reason, 
the single free-standing umbrella is usually restricted to rather modest dimen-
sions. The umbrella has also been used in multiple repetitions to cover large 
plan areas where occasional columns are acceptable. 53 In such applications, 
greater lateral stability can be provided through frame action of the inter-
connected shells. 
The stress pattern for any of the other cases shown in figure 4-44 is easily 
obtained by locating the corresponding quadrant OJGK on each figure. Then, 
the forces in the edge members are computed by starting from a point of 
assumed zero axial force, usually the junction of the edge member with an 
external boundary. 
Next, consider a dead load Pd' constant per unit area of middle surface. 
Referring to figure 4-40,

(4.205a) 
For most practical cases, k4 « k2, and the last term in equation (4.205a) can be 
neglected. We may also approximate the remaining square root term with the 
binomial expansion 
qz ~ p{ 1 + ~k2(X2 + 1"2) + ... J

Noting that !#',iy = -S, we integrate equation (4.206) to get

(4.205b) 
(4.206) 
(4.207) 
Then, we compute the extensional stress resultants from equations (4. 180a) and

(4.209) 
Whereas S is independent of any boundary conditions, just as in the case of the 
uniform loading, the extensional stress resultants are dependent on the bound-
ary conditions. Also, since we may specify Ni amd Ny on only one of the two 
parallel boundaries, the opposite boundaries must develop the computed stress 
resultants. If, for example, we consider the umbrella shell shown in figure 4-45, 
it is reasonable to presume that these stress resultants vanish on the exterior 
boundaries, so that 
Ni(O, 1") = 0 
Ny(X,O) = 0

The expressions for the dead-load stress resultants in this shell are evaluated 
from equations (4.206), (4.211), (4.208), (4.209), (4.174), and (4.204). 
(4.212a) 
(4.212b) 
(4.212c) 
The forces in the edge members are computed in a similar manner as for the 
uniform load case. However, since S = SeX, Y), we must proceed more formally.

(4.213b) 
Note that the compressive force C(X) is evaluated in equation (4.213b) by 
integrating along the inclined edge member. The integrands for equations 
(4.213a) and (4.213b) are computed by substituting X = 0 and Y = d, respec-
tively, in equation (4.212a); then, the maximum values of T and C are found by 
inserting Y = d and X = d as the upper limits of integration. 
Earlier, we alluded to the possibility of replacing the dead load which is 
constant over the shell surface, with a uniform load which is constant over the 
projected area. A comparison of the solutions for the loadings Pu and Pd' as 
given by equations (4.201) and (4.212), provides an obvious motivation in terms 
of algebraic simplicity if the errors introduced are not significant. As mentioned 
before, if we replace Pd by an equivalent Pu, we should use an adjusted load qz, 
which is the total weight of the shell divided by the plan area, to satisfy overall 
statics. We find the total weight of the shell using equation (4.205b) as 
Q = S: S: p{ 1 + ~k2(X2 + Y2)JdX dY 
(4.214) 
and then compute the equivalent uniform load 
(4.215) 
for use in equation (4.199). The effect of this simplification on the accuracy of 
the ensuing solution is not great for many practical geometries. 
An interesting alternative to the free edge boundary conditions stated in 
equation (4.210) is implied in a design example based on an actual shell having 

174 
4 Membrane Theory 
the basic gable form shown in figure 4-44(b).s4 If the exterior edges KG and GJ 
were taken as stress-free, the integration functions could be readily evaluated 
by substituting 
Nx(d, Y) = 0 
and 
Ny(X,d) = 0 
into equations (4.208) and (4.209), respectively. However, the subsequent 
expressions for Nx and Ny, analogous to equations (4.212b) and (4.212c), would 
give nonzero (tensile) values along the ridge lines OJ and OK; that is, 
Nx(O, Y) > 0 
and 
Ny(X,O) > 0 
The horizontal components of these stress resultants would be balanced by 
identical forces from the adjacent segments, but the vertical (Z) components 
would add to produced an unbalanced force that would have to be sustained 
by the edge member. This is illustrated in the inset of view bb in figure 4-44(b). 
To avoid this situation, the designer apparently decided it was preferable to 
assume that Nx and Ny vanish along the ridge lines, and then to develop the 
calculated values of the stress resultants on the perimeter. For this case, Nx and 
Ny become compressive as well. We surmise that occasionally there is some 
latitude in specifying boundary conditions in a membrane theory solution, and 
that the subsequent problem of providing physical constraints consistent with 
the assumed conditions should be kept in mind. This shell is discussed further 
in sections 4.4.3.3 and 4.4.3.4. 
4.4.3.3 Arch Action. The state of pure shear found for uniformly loaded hyper-
bolic paraboloid shells can be interpreted from another standpoint. We study 
the same quadrant OJGK shown in figure 4-45, but, for variety, we consider 
the saddle shell illustrated in figure 4-44(d). The membrane theory stress analy-
sis is the same, and the uniform negative shear S is shown in figure 4-46. From 
elementary strength of materials, it is easily shown that a state of pure shear 
with respect to the X - Y axes corresponds to principal tensile and compressive 
stresses of the same magnitude acting in the X and Y directions as shown. If 
we then take sections through the element parallel to the X and Y axes, we 
reveal segments of the parabolic generators of the basic hyperbolic paraboloid 
shown in figure 4-41. The convex parabola MN parallel to the Yaxis acts as a 
compression arch subject to a uniformly distributed load Pu, producing a con-
stant axial compression of S per unit width. This is the elementary problem of 
the second degree parabola subject to a uniform load per unit projected length. 
Now, examining the parabola parallel to the X axis PQ, we find a similar

Arch Action for a Uniformly Loaded Hyperbolic Paraboloid 
situation, except that we have a concave parabola forming a tension arch. Each 
parabola imparts a constant reaction S per unit width of shell on the edge 
members, e.g., at points Nand P on JG. Of course, the other ends of the 
parabolas, indicated by dashed extensions, will intersect edge members in 
adjacent quadrants. 
To complete the arch representation, we investigate the edge forces. Con-
sidering a typical point on the boundary (e.g., N), observe that the unit width 
compression arch imparts a force of S in the + Y direction, whereas the tension 
arch acting on the same segment of the edge beam also produces a force of S 
directed along the + X axis. The intersecting arches are coplanar at N, and we 
may resolve the intersecting forces into components along and normal to the 

176 
4 Membrane Theory 
edge member. The normal components cancel, while the axial components 
produce a resultant force of ..)2S. This force acts over a length of edge beam 
= ")2, so that we find a constant force S per unit length of edge beam as before. 
Thus, the arch representation of the hyperbolic paraboloid is certainly equi-
valent to the previous shell solution, and often provides valuable insight-
especially if irregular shapes or boundaries are encountered. 
The gable or hipped HP, figure 4-44(b), which was discussed in section 4.4.3.2, 
should carry load primarily by compression arches parallel to OG and tension 
arches parallel to KJ. Subsequent studies by Shaabon and Ketchum55 have 
shown that the tension arches are ineffective, and that practically the entire load 
is transmitted to the corners by the intersecting compression arches passing 
through the crown. Of course, the stress level is essentially doubled. This 
behavior is attributed to the inability of the edge members to resist the tensile 
forces in the shell; rather, they displace inward, forcing the load to flow to the 
corners. 54,55 
4.4.3.4 Edge Members. We have seen that the membrane theory stress analysis 
for hyperbolic paraboloids with straight-line boundaries is fairly straight-
forward. We have also established the necessity of developing the in-plane 
shear forces on the boundary. We now look at the requirements for ideal edge 
members: 
1. In order to develop the shear fully, the edge members should be inextensible. 
2. Since the entire weight of the shell is ultimately carried to the foundation 
through only four to eight compression members for the cases illustrated in 
figure 4-44, the edge members should be capable of sustaining sizable axial 
forces. These forces will produce corresponding strains that will conflict with 
the first requirement. 
3. The edge members should be self-supporting and should not be carried by 
the shell. Since these members may be rather sizable, they would impart a 
sizable additional load on the shell that might be unacceptable. 
From this list, it is obvious that in practice it may be difficult to attain any of 
these ideal conditions. As a specific illustration, consider the cantilever shell 
shown in figure 4-44(c). For this shell, we have four different edge members, as 
seen in table 4-2. Typical sections for such members in rs:inforced concrete shells

Fig.4-47 Edge Members for Hyperbolic Paraboloids 
are shown in figure 4-47. The dashed lines indicate possible smooth transitions 
between the shell and the edge member that may be desirable for architectural 
and/or constructional purposes. The edge members may be proportioned as 
struts under axial tension or compression. 
Next, consider the self-weight of the edge members. Referring to figure 
4-44(c), the ridge member OJ could be considered as a beam spanning between 
o and J. The valley member GJ forms a triangular frame GJG' with the 
corresponding member on the other half of the shell and resists the beam 
reactions at 0 from the two ridge members, OJ and 0' J, in addition to their 
self-weight and the shear forces imparted by the shell. Exterior member KK' is 

178 
4 Membrane Theory 
regarded as a beam spanning between K and K' and carrying the beam reaction 
at 0 from OJ, their self-weight and the shell shear forces. This brings us to the 
exterior members KG and K' G', which are required to take the beam reactions 
from KK' along with their self-weight and the shear forces, seemingly as 
cantilevers. 
Other alternatives are possible. In some cases, it is feasible to utilize exterior 
walls or window wall framing to support the perimeter edge members. The shell 
shown in figure 2-8(b) admits this possibility, whereas the shell shown in figure 
2-8(e) obviously does not. Also, some designers might convert the self-weight 
of some of the edge members~particularly those which cannot sustain them-
selves~to equivalent distributed loads, and include these loads in the uniform 
load qz. This essentially requires the shell to support the edge beams. 
Perhaps the most challenging cases from the design standpoint are canti-
levered compression edge members, such as KG, or the even longer members, 
such as G' G, that occur in saddle shells as shown in figure 4-44(d). A spectacular 
example is shown in figure 2-8(a). 
Referring again to figures 4-44(c) and 4-45, if the neutral axis of the edge beam 
for member KG does not coincide with the middle surface of the shell, the 
shear force acts through an eccentricity that produces a uniformly distributed 
moment. For the down turned beam (figure 4-47), the moment is opposite to 
that produced by the cantilevered self-weight and thus counters the self-weight 
somewhat; whereas for the upturned beam, the moment would add to that 
arising from the self-weight. Depending on whether tension or compression is 
introduced into the edge member by the shell and the particular exterior 
support condition, a countering prestressing moment can generally be pro-
duced by appropriate upturning or downturning of the member to give the 
required eccentricity. 
Another possibility~particularly effective for tension edge members~is to 
produce mechanical prestressing with rods or cables. Also, as shown on the 
examples of figure 4-44, it is desirable to use ties between the supported ends 
of the inclined compression members to counter the horizontal component of 
the thrust. Insofar as the reduction of the dominance of the membrane type 
action and the subsequent introduction of bending into the shell and the edge 
member are concerned, a potentially detrimental effect is a relative horizontal 
displacement of the abutments. 56 A comprehensive discussion of the forces in 
the edge members of a hipped hyperbolic paraboloid and some pertinent design 
recommendations for such shells are presented in Schnobrich and in Shaaban 
and Ketchum. 57 
Again, referring to the hipped shell discussed in the preceding two sections, 
it has been suggested that if the edge members are not effective in transmitting 
the in-plane shear stresses to the supports, then they may be reduced in size to 
avoid loading the shell excessively. 57 Additionally, for a continuous group of 
hipped hypars, the effect of prescribing a relative displacement of the abut-
ments consistent with the strain in a steel tie was investigated. 58 The state of 

4.4 Shells of Translation 
179 
stress in the shell closely resembled the membrane theory pattern, but the edge 
members received a nonsymmetrical loading. Limited field observations sup-
ported this characterization, as opposed to the unrestrained or undeforming 
idealizations. 
Finally, with respect to hyperbolic paraboloids with straight boundaries, 
note that although the presentation has been pointed somewhat at reinforced 
concrete shells, there are many interesting applications of this very efficient 
structural form in other materials: for example, in steel59 and wood. 60 A 
cantilevered, cable-supported hyperbolic paraboloid forms the roof for the 
jumbo jet hangar shown in figure 2-8(v), and metal hyperbolic paraboloid units 
were used between long-span arched trusses to cover a large arena in Mexico 
City constructed for the 1968 Olympic games. 
4.4.3.5 Hyperbolic Paraboloid with Curved Boundaries. We now resume our 
investigation of the basic hyperbolic paraboloid described by equation (4.182) 
and shown in figure 4-41. We restrict ourselves to a qz loading, for which 
equation (4.181) becomes 
Z,xx.f/'.yy - 2Z,xy.f/'.xy + Z,yy.f/'.xx = -qz 
From equation (4.182), 
2cx 
Zxx=-

and 
2cy 
Z,yy = -bl 
Z,XY = 0 
so that equation (4.216) reduces to 
2cx = 
2cy 
7 
~,yy - bl.f/'.xx = -qz(X, Y) 
(4.216) 
(4.217) 
As a specific case, we take the uniform load qz = - Pu' There are obviously 
multiple particular solutions, since the derivatives on fF are uncoupled. Two 
possibilities are 
(4.218) 
and 
(4.219) 

180 
Also, we may have any linear combination of ffl and ff2 
ff(X, Y) = 2 1 ff1(X) + 22 ff2 (Y) 
where

(4.220) 
This presents us with a multiplicity of particular solutions for the projected 
stress resultants, which can be written using equation (4.180) as

(4.221c) 
The actual stress resultants, Nx and Ny, may then be found from equation 
(4.174). 
For a given shell, the solution which will prevail is a function of the relative 
stiffnesses of the boundaries. Referring to figure 4-41, if the boundaries at 
X = ± a are fully developed in the x direction, and the shell is unrestrained at 
Y = ± b, we would choose 21 = 0 and 22 = 1. This, of course, corresponds to 
a tension arch in the x direction, such as we encountered in a previous section. 
Similarly, 21 = 1 and 22 = 0 indicate full support in the y direction at Y = ± b, 
and no restraint at X = ± a, or a compression arch in the y direction. Obviously, 
with finite in-plane resistance along all boundaries, we would have nonzero 
values of both 21 and 22, but the necessary requirement is that at least one pair 
of the boundaries must develop the ensuing forces. 
The possibility of "directing" the extensional stresses by adjusting the support 
conditions makes this version of the hyperbolic paraboloid quite versatile. 
Although a designer may prefer the state of uniform compression, 21 = 1, for 
a reinforced concrete shell, a tensile state, 22 = 1, might be more desirable for 
a steel structure. Numerous structures in this shape have been built using 
high-strength steel cables as the principal members. In such applications, sag-
ging cables resist the principal tension and hogging cables span in the normal 
direction. A roofing system consisting of precast panels or a fabric membrane 
may be applied to such a structure. 
Another variation on the hyperbolic paraboloid with curved boundaries is 
to leave the edges free of extensional stresses and to resist the surface loading 
by shear forces along only two parallel boundaries. In turn, the resulting 
reactions can be provided by a pair of axially loaded boundary arches. As an 
illustration, consider the hyperbolic paraboloid shown in figure 4-41 with 
boundary conditions 
(4.222a) 

4.4 Shells of Translation 
Ny(X, ±b) = 0 
S(X, ±b) = 0 
181 
(4.222b) 
(4.222c) 
Moreover, the boundaries AD and BC can develop the in-plane shear stresses, 
i.e., 
S(±a, Y) -# 0 
(4. 222d) 
A plan view of this shell is shown as figure 4-48(a), with b assumed to be 
equal to 2a. Assume Cy = 4cx, so that cx/a2 = cy/b2 = c/a2. Equation (4.182) 
then becomes 
(4.223) 
These geometrical simplifications facilitate the following development. Also, the 
applied loading is taken as qz = - Pu, and the sense of S( ± a, Y) is shown on 
the figure so as to provide an upward ( + Z) resultant. 
This problem is handily treated by first selecting a particular solution, and 
then enforcing the prescribed boundary conditions through a homogeneous 
solution. 
Initially, the loading is assumed to be resisted by extensional stresses along 
one pair of boundaries (e.g., AB and CD), as shown in figure 4-48 (b). This 
corresponds to A.1 = 1 and A.2 = 0 in equations (4.220) and (4.221), for which

(4.224) 
Nx(X, Y) = S(X, Y) = 0 
as shown on the figure. The actual reactions, which are equivalent to Ny(X, ± 2a), 
act in the middle surface and may be found from equations (4.223), (4.172), and 
(4.174b); however, it is convenient to proceed in terms of the projected resul-
tants. The solution given in equation (4.224) balances the applied loading but 
violates the boundary conditions stipulated in equations (4.222). Hence, it 
represents only a particular solution for this system. 
The homogeneous solution may be efficiently obtained through a physical 
rather than a purely mathematical approach. We first identify the straight lines 
or real characteristics on the surface. The slopes of these lines in the X - Y plane 
are found from equation (4.185) specialized for the current geometry: 
a1 
bl = ±1 
(4.225) 
Some typical X - Y traces are shown in figure 4-48(c). We concentrate on those 
which pierce the boundaries AB and CD at the reference points (X, =+= 2a), 
respectively. Taking a segment of length ,J2 along each boundary (see inset, 
figure 4-46), the edge forces ,J2N*, are resolved and translated along the

characteristics to the X = ± a boundaries. The translated forces are equal to 
N* and act over boundary segments of length ../2 along BC and CD. 
Next, as shown on figure 4-48(d), additional characteristics that pass through 
the points on BC and AD which were pierced by the translated forces from AB 

184 
4 Membrane Theory 
and CD are added. To produce resultant boundary forces that are parallel to 
BC and AD, self-equilibrated edge forces N* acting along the newly denoted 
characteristics are supplied. These forces give a resultant force in the Y direction 
equal to 2N*(,J2/2). Dividing by the length of the boundary segment, J2, we 
obtain 
JS(±a, Y)J = N* = JNy(X, ±2a)J 
(4.226) 
as the projected boundary reactions. 
It is obvious that the foregoing argument can be repeated for each point 
along AB and CD, so that the additional solution represented by figure 4-48(d) 
combined with the solution given by equation (4.224) fulfills the boundary 
conditions stated in equations (4.222a-c). 
It is easily shown that the additional solution is indeed a homogeneous 
solution to equation (4.217). Allowing for symmetry, the shell is divided into 
four regions in figure 4-48 (e), and the stress state for each is indicated. In regions 
1 and 4, Nx = Ny = ±N* and S = O. Referring to equations (4.180a) and 
(4.180b), ~yy = ~xx. Since cx/a 2 = cy/b2, equation (4.217) is satisfied. For 
regions 2 and 3, the state of pure shear-i.e., Nx = Ny = 0; S = ± N*-is 
obviously a solution to equation (4.217). Thus, the combination of figures 
4-48(b) and 4-48(e) gives the total stresses in each region, figure 4-48(f). 
Note that the discontinuities between the various regions make the mem-
brane theory state of stress only an idealized possibility for this case. Careful 
detailing and construction are required to approach this stress distribution in 
an actual structure. 
The Saddled orne, figure 2-8(n), is an elegant anticlastic shell with the bound-
ary defined by a space curve. The form is developed from a sphere of about 136 
m in diameter, as shown in figure 4-49(a) The floor is circular, formed by the 
intersection of a horizontal plane and the sphere (b), and the roof perimeter is 
the intersection of an HP with the sphere (c) This produces the definitive form 
of the appropriately named Saddled orne (d) bounded by an undulating ring 
beam. 
The roof is a stressed cable network with precast lightweight concrete panels 
placed on the cables and the gaps filled with concrete. The result is a solid, 
ribbed thin shell. 
The ring beam is subjected to a complex system of loading which is basically 
counterbalanced by prestressing. A member of this sophistication could only 
be analyzed accurately by a numerical procedure, the finite element method, 
which is well within the state of the art of modern technology. 
The loading on the roof is a function of the stiffness of the ring and the 
restraining A-frames, located at the two low points at the ends of the center 
hogging cables and visible on figure 2-8(n). A very flexible ring would minimize 
the forces in the net but allow large horizontal deflections; the restraint pro-
duced by a rigid A-frame would minimize the deflections at the expense of a 
larger horizontal reaction transferred from the ring. The optimized final design 
produced an elastic support which controlled the deflections while resisting the

Comparing this structure with the straight boundary HPs, figure 4-44, the 
evolution of this form, facilitated by high-strength cables, prestressing, and 
computer technology, is striking. 
An interesting extension of the basic hyperbolic paraboloidal geometry can 
be achieved by intersecting two shells, as shown in figure 4-50. Each quadrant 
is known as a groined vault. The basic resistance is essentially in the directions 
parallel to the exterior boundaries. Along the edges, the loading is transferred 

186 
4 Membrane Theory 
by the shell, which acts as an assemblage of compression arches, to the groin 
arches, which pick up reactions from two adjacent vaults and transmit the forces 
to the foundation. Again, it is desirable to provide horizontal restraint at the 
base of the groin arches through a system of ties. Many variations on the 
groined vault concept are found. An elegant example with a parabolic cross 
section is shown in figure 2-8(f). This shell form is treated in detail by Billington, 
who provides a simplified model to compute the stresses in the groin arches as 
well as a detailed analysis procedure for the shell.62 
4.4.4 Elliptic Paraboloid: The elliptic paraboloid is generated by the trans-
lation of one convex paraboloid over another, as shown in figure 4-51(a). The 
equation of the shell is given by 
(4.227) 
It is easily observed and may be demonstrated numerically using equation (2.38) 
that this shell has positive Gaussian curvature, and, as such, we do not find 
straight lines on the surface. 
The name elliptic paraboloid comes from the fact that if a horizontal plane 
Z = Z = constant (Z < 0) is passed through the shell, the equation of the 
intersection 
(4.228) 
is an ellipse. Also, if cx/a2 = cy/b2 = c/d2, we have a paraboloid of revolution 
X2 + y2 = _(dC
2)z 
with the intersection at Z = 2(2 < 0) given by 
X2 + y2 = _(dC
2)z 
which is, of course, a circle, since Z is negative.

(4.231) 
which is very similar to equation (4.217), and suggests that this shell would resist

parallel to the X and Y axis. It is easily shown by comparison with equations 
(4.217), (4.218), and (4.221) that particular solutions of the form

will produce projected stress resultants Nx = 0 and Ny = 0, respectively. How-
ever, these simple unidirectional patterns are often not compatible with the 

188 
4 Membrane Theory 
physical situation, because it may be somewhat difficult to provide the reactions 
required to develop Ny along Y = ± band/or Nx along X = ± a. Rather, we 
wish to explore the possibility of this system transmitting the loading directly 
to the four corners, without the necessity of providing in-plane restraint along 
the exterior boundaries. 
The specific requirement is to find a solution to equation (4.231), such that 
Nx( ± a, Y) = Ny(X, ± b) = 0 except at the corners, (± a, ± b). Obviously, it is 
only possible to satisfy one or the other condition using equation (4.232) or 
(4.233), so that, at best, !?3 or !?4 will serve as a particular solution. We may 
add a homogeneous solution in the form of an infinite series that identically 
satisfies the same boundary conditions as the selected particular solution, !?3 
or !?4' Then, the amplitudes of the terms of the infinite series are adjusted so 
that the total solution, homogeneous plus particular, will satisfy the remaining 
boundary conditions.

ffs is easily shown to be the homogeneous solution of equation (4.231), and we 
have seen that !?4 produces Ny = 0 throughout. From equation (4.180b), we 
observe that because of :?s, Ny is proportional to cos(jn/2b) Y, which vanishes 
at Y = ± b. Thus, the boundary conditions on Ny(X, ± a) are identically satis-
fied. 
To proceed with the solution for the stress resultants, .?4 must be expanded 
in a Fourier series compatible with .?s. Nx( ± a, Y) is then written from equation 
(4.180a), and the Aj coefficients are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition 
Nx( ± a, Y) = 0, Then, the stress function and stress resultants are found in series 
form from equations (4.234), (4.180), and (4.174). The details are rather involved 
algebraically and are not given here. Complete solutions, including parametric 
tabulations, are available.63 
It is apparent that the resulting membrane theory solution requires that 
the boundary arches develop the in-plane shear and thereby transmit a por-
tion of the applied load to the corners, as shown in figure 4-51(b). However, 
the enforced boundary conditions prohibit direct stresses along the exterior 
boundaries. The shear S builds up to a theoretically infinite value at the corners,

where a concentrated reaction acts, and the remaining load is carried directly 
to the supports by arch strips AOe and BOD in a fashion similar to that of the 
hipped HP, as discussed in section 4.4.3.3. It is apparent that the actual stress 
state cannot be fully described by membrane theory, and, therefore, bending 
effects should be considered as well. Also, the details of construction might well 
include some stiffening and rounding of the corner to spread the high shear 
forces dictated by membrane theory equilibrium. 
4.4.5 Conoids: A surface produced by the translation of a straight line genera-
tor between two directrices- one of which is itself a straight line and the other 
a plane curve- is called a conoid (figure 4-52). If the generator is perpendicu-
lar to the directrices, we have a square conoid; if not, the conoid is said to be 
skewed. 
Shells in the form of conoids are used for roof applications when it is desired 
to maintain a relatively flat profile and still provide openings to admit natural 
sunlight. 
The coordinate system shown in figure 4-52 has the Y-Z plane normal to the 
symmetry line of the curved directrix, whereas the X axis is taken along the 
straight directrix. With respect to this coordinate system, the equation of the 
curved directrix is of the form Z = f(X) and the square conoid is described by 
Z(X, Y) = Y f(X) 
L 
(4.235) 

190 
4 Membrane Theory 
For a skewed conoid, the surface equation is more complicated. In either case, 
the conoid is not a second order surface, and the discriminant test for Gaussian 
curvature, equation (2.38), is inapplicable. However, it is readily observed from 
figure 4-52 that the skewed conoid has negative Gaussian curvature, because 
there are two sets of straight line generators, whereas the square conoid has 
zero Gaussian curvature, since the two sets of generators become coincident. 
Consider a square parabolic conoid, 
f(X) = h(1 - ~:) 
(4.236a) 
and 
z =!: Y(1 _ X2) 
L 
a2 
(4.236b) 
We now write equation (4.181) for a uniform load qz = - Pu: 
-C~~ Y) ~yy + C;~ X ) ~Xy = Pu 
(4.237) 
Although, as we have observed with respect to the hyperbolic and elliptic 
paraboloids, multiple solutions for stress functions can frequently be generated, 
a solution of practical utility must be consistent with the physical boundary 
conditions. Because of symmetry, we should have S vanish along X = 0, so that 
-~Xy(O, Y) = O. Also, ifthe curved directrix cannot sustain forces normal to 
the plane of the curve, Nx(X,L) = 0, implying that ~yy(X,L) = O. 
Again, comprehensive results are readily available in the literature,64 so that 
we will not dwell on the details of the various solutions for conoidal shells. 
However, it is of general interest to consider a simplified model of the conoid 
that is suggested by our earlier study of hyperbolic paraboloids. From figure 
4-52, it is apparent that the conoid could possibly transmit the uniform load as 
a series of arches in the X -Z plane, with the attendant thrusts developed along 
the boundaries X = ± a. The provision ofthe appropriate boundary conditions 
is plausible, since the horizontal components of the thrust would balance along 
the interior boundaries, and the vertical components could be resisted by walls 
or beams in the Y direction. Further, the shell would seemingly be entirely in 
compression. 
With respect to the equation (4.237), we may obviously select a solution of 
the form 
(4.238) 
which would yield the one-way arch action with Ny and S = O. Then, if we return 
to equation (4. 174a) for the actual stress resultant N", and compute

(4.239) 
from equations (4.204) and (4.238). For small values of Y, Nx grows very large, 
with a singularity at Y = O. Essentially, this reflects that the shell becomes very 
shallow and the arches correspondingly flatter, until they degenerate into a 
straight line along the direction Y = O. Obviously, this region of the conoid 
cannot be sustained in equilibrium by extensional forces alone, and bending 
must be considered. The use of a plate approximation for this region would 
seem appropriate.

In section 4.3.2.2, we have seen that the self-weight meridional stress resultant in 
a uniform thickness spherical dome increases as t/J increases. The correspond-
ing stress (I",,,, = N",/h will, of course, increase in the same fashion. To try 
to equalize the self-weight meridional stress in a hemispherical dome, it is pro-
posed to increase the thickness from a basic value h = ho at t/J = 0 to h = hb at 
t/J = 90° by using the transition h(t/J) = ho + (hb - ho) sin t/J. 
(a) Compute the N", and Ns for the resulting self-weight load, where the shell 
material has mass density p.

(a) Determine the membrane theory stress resultants due to a horizontal quasi-
static seismic loading. 
(b) For a hemisphere, determine the total base shear and overturning moment. 
(c) Verify the values of N~ and S at ifJ = 90° computed by (a), using the results

4.17 To optimize the efficiency of the shell material, the meridional and circumferential 
stress resultants Nt/J and No should be equal at all points on the shell. This can 
be accomplished by specifying that Nt/J(ifJ,8) = No(ifJ,8) = N* at every point on 
a dome of constant thickness for a given axisymmetric loading condition and then 
finding the requisite shell of revolution geometry, i.e., R.p(ifJ), Ro(ifJ), Ro(ifJ). 
Investigate this possibility for the following loading cases: 
(a) Uniform normal pressure, q = constant. 
(b) Hydrostatic pressure q = yZ, where Z is measured from the pole. 
Part (b) is analogous to the problem of determining the shape of a drop of liquid 
resting on a plane surface, where N* is the surface tension. (See A. Pfluger,

CHAPTER 5 
Deformations 
5.1 General 
In the earlier chapters, we developed a geometric description of the middle 
surface of a shell which proved to be adequate to derive the equations of 
equilibrium. In turn, a simplified subset of the equilibrium equations formed 
the basis of the membrane theory of shells, for which many important practical 
applications were illustrated. Although membrane action in a shell is desirable 
from the dual standpoints of mathematical simplification and material efficiency, 
the requisite conditions for corresponding behavior cannot always be simulated 
in an actual structure. Consequently, to expand our base of understanding of 
shell behavior, we must develop relationships between the forces and the 
deformations of the shell. The first step is a description of the displacements, 
where we follow the vector approach suggested by Novozhilov. 1 
5.2 Displacement 
5.2.1 Displacement Vector: In figure 5-1(a), a differential element ofthe middle 
surface is shown before and after deformation. The reference point 0 located 
on the middle surface moves to the position 0', and this displacement is denoted 
by A. Considering a second point 0('), located a distance' from 0 along the 
original unit normal tn' the corresponding position after deformation is 0;(0 
(i = 1 or 2), and the displacement between 0(0 and oa,) is A;(n 
We have shown two possible positions of oao, o~ (0 and 0~(0. Point o~ (0 
lies on the unit normal to the deformed middle surface, t~, at the same distance 
,from the middle surface. The point o~ (0 is located on t~ because of assumption 
[3], table 1-1, and remains, from the middle surface because of assumption [4]. 
On the other hand, point 0~(0 is also located, from the deformed middle 
surface, but no longer necessarily lies on the normal t~; that is, the location of 
0~(0 only requires the enforcement of assumption [4]. Since assumption [3] 
refers to the suppression of transverse shearing strains, we may surmise that 
the difference in 0 ~ (0 and 0 ~ (0 is the effect of the transverse shearing strain. 
This is clearly shown in figures 5-1(b) and 5-1 (c), where views normal to tp and 
206

t~ are shown with the transverse shearing strains defined as ,},,, and '}'p. The 
positive sense shown is chosen arbitrarily to highlight '}'~ and Yp. 
It was stated in the introduction that most classical work in shell and plate 
theories has been based on the suppression of transverse shearing deformations 
to achieve mathematical simplification. Currently, however, the analysis of 
complex plates and shells is frequently carried out by powerful numerical 
techniques that are not necessarily dependent on this simplification. Also, some 
authors have expressed an opinion that the inclusion of transverse shearing 
strains extends the bounds of the theory to include somewhat thicker plates 
and shells. This is somewhat difficult to quantify, since a true thick shell theory 
should account for transverse normal stresses as well, but it appears to be 
correct in a heuristic sense. In the interest of generality, therefore, we will retain 

208 
5 Deformations 
the transverse shearing strains and treat o~(C) as the deformed point away from 
the middle surface, and A2 ({) as the corresponding displacement. Subsequently, 
we will show that a theory which neglects transverse shearing strains is easily 
obtained from the more general theory. 
From figure 5-1, 
(5.1) 
or 
(5.2) 
Equation (5.2) expresses the deformation of a point off the middle surface in 
terms of the deformation of the corresponding middle surface point and the 
unchanging distance between the middle surface and the point in question. 
This establishes the pattern for subsequent developments: to relate the behavior 
of a point away from the middle surface to the behavior of the corresponding 
point on the middle surface. 
5.2.2 Displacements in Terms of Middle Surface Parameters: Now, we express 
the displacement vectors in terms of the unit tangent vectors of the undeformed 
middle surface: 
A = Data + Dptp + D.t. 
A2(0 = Da(Ota + Dp({)tp + D.(Ot. 
(5.3a) 
(5.3b) 
Here, DOl' Dp, and D. are the components of the middle surface displacement 
in the respective directions, and Da(O, Dp({), and D.(O are the corresponding 
components away from the middle surface. Also, the position vector to the 
deformed middle surface is expressed in terms of the displacement vector by 
r'=r+A 
(5.4) 
In equation (5.2), the unit vectors of the deformed middle surface, t~, tp, and 
t~, are present. In line with equation (5.4) for the vector r', we seek to write t~, 
tp, and t~ in terms of the unit vectors of the undeformed middle surface. Since 
t~=t~xtp 
it is sufficient to develop suitable expressions for t~ and tp. 
By analogy with the definitions in equations (2.16) and (2.8), we have 
r'

Thus, we have defined A' and B' as the Lame parameters for the deformed 
middle surface. Now, taking %a of equation (S.4) 
r: .. = r ... + (D .. t .. ) ... + (Dptp) ... + (D"tn)... 
(S.8) 
The first term in equation (S.8) is replaced using equation (2.16a), and the 
remaining terms are differentiated by the product rule, with the derivatives of 
the unit tangent vectors obtained from equation (2.17). After carrying out the 
indicated operations, we have 
r: .. = A[(1 + B .. )t .. + B .. ptp - I/I .. t n] 
where the coefficients of the unit vectors are given by

(S.lOc) 
(S.l1) 
(S.12a) 
(S.12b) 
(S.12c) 
The coefficients defined in equations (S.10) and (S.12) are extremely important 
in what follows and are interpreted from a physical standpoint at a later stage 
of this chapter. 
We are ready to substitute equations (S.9)-(S.12) into equations (S.6a) and 
(S.6b). As we carry out this operation, recall assumption [2] oftable 1-1, which 
restricted the development to the domain of comparatively small deformations. 
This limitation enables products of the coefficients defined in equations (S.lO) 

210 
5 Deformations 
and (5.12) to be neglected, and ensures that the subsequent relationships will 
be linear. We wish to emphasize at this point that although assumption [2J 
greatly simplifies the problem from the mathematical standpoint, the justification 
is based on verification of the magnitudes of the neglected terms for a particular 
problem or class of problems. In most practical applications, the linear theory 
has been verified to be adequate, but, if not, a variety of nonlinear theories are 
available. 2 
Performing the indicated substitutions, we have from equations (5.7a) and 
(5.9) 
A' = A[(l + B~)2 + B;p + 1/1;]1/2 
~ A(l + B~) 
and from equations (5.7b) and (5.11), 
B' = B[B~~ + (1 + Bp)2 + I/IffJl/2 
~ B(l + Bp) 
after the product terms are dropped. Then, from equation (5.6a), 
t' = A [(1 + B~)t~ + B~fJtp -

(5.13) 
(5.14) 
(5.15) 
(5.16) 
Finally, we compute the vector product t~ x tp, which, after simplification, is 
(5.17) 
Equation (5.17) is the desired expression of the unit normal to the deformed 
middle surface, in terms of the tangent vectors to the undeformed middle surface. 
Substituting equations (5.15), (5.16), and (5.17) into equation (5.2) gives 
A 2 (C) = A + C[(I/I~ + y~ + YpBp~)t~ + (I/Ip + Yp + Y~B"p)tp 
- (y"l/I" + ypljlp)tnJ 
(5.18a) 
Again, products of the deformation parameters, such as ypBp", are neglected, so 
that equation (5.18a) simplifies to 

5.2 Displacement 
In view of equation (S.3a), equation (S.18b) may be rewritten as 
A2 «() = [D" + (1/1" + y")]t,, + [Dp + (I/Ip + Yp)]tp + Dntn 
so that the components of A2 (O are 
D,,«() = D" + (1/1" + y,,) 
Dp«() = Dp + «I/Ip + Yp) 
Dnm = Dn 
211 
(S.18b) 
(S.19) 
(S.20a) 
(S.20b) 
(S.20c) 
Here, we have expressed the components of the displacement of an arbitrary 
point on the shell in terms of the displacement of the corresponding point on the 
middle surface and the unchanging separation of the points along the unit normal 
vector. Equation (S.20c) is, of course, a direct restatement of assumption [4]. 
At this point, we observe that the popular shell theories which incorporate 
assumption [3], as well, may be obtained by simply setting y" = Yp = 0 in the 
previous equations. 
5.2.3 Rotations: Recalling that the coefficients D" and Dp represent the respective 
displacements of the middle surface along the s" and sp coordinate lines, the 
terms 1/1" and I/Ip may be viewed as rotations of the normal t~ about the tp 
and t~ axes, respectively. To show this, we construct figures S-2(a) and S-2(b), 
which are, in turn, identical to the views shown in figures S-1(b) and S-l(c). 
On figure S-2, the projections of the unit vectors to the undeformed surface t" 
and tp may be considered to remain unit vectors within the scope of this theory; 
i.e., t,,· t~ ~ 1 from equation (S.lS). If we scalar multiply equation (S.17) by t", 
and then tp, we get

Equation (S.21a) is interpreted in figure S-2(a). Continuing,

For small rotations

or, 1/1" is the rotation of the normal to the deformed middle surface about the 
tp axis. Similarly, from figure S-2(b), I/Ip is the rotation of the normal about 
the t~ axis. Within the scope of the small deformation theory, 1/1" and I/Ip may 
be visualized as rotations about tp and t" as well. 
We now consider the transverse shearing strains, initially defined in figures 
S-l(b) and S-I(c), superimposed on the rotations 1/1" and I/Ip in figures S-2(a) and 
S-2(b). We see that the terms 1/1" + y" and I/Ip + yp, which initially appeared in 
equation (S.19), may be interpreted as rotations. If we consider a line connecting 
a point away from the deformed middle surface, O2, and the corresponding 
middle surface point, and a second line along the normal to the undeformed 
middle surface tn' the angles formed by the intersection of these lines are, 
respectively, 
D"p = I/Ill + Yll 
(S.22a) 
in the (X-n plane and 
Dp" = I/Ip + Yp 
(S.22b) 
in the fJ-n plane. We also may observe from figure S-2 that if y" and Yp = 0, 
DIlP and Dp" are, in turn, the angles between t" and t~, and tp and tp. DIlP 
and Dpll are termed middle surface rotations and, together with D", Dp, and 
Dn , constitute the set of generalized displacements for the shell theory under 
study. 
The complete description of the displacement of any point on or within the 
shell surface is given in terms of the five generalized displacements. Seemingly, 
rotation about the normal has no utility, provided that the structure is con-
strained against rigid body movement. However, there are occasionally cases 
where the shell has a slope discontinuity or is approximated by an assemblage 
of flat (facet) surfaces. 3 It may be then convenient to introduce the normal 
rotation, which is known as the drilling degree of freedom.

5.3 Strain 
5.3.1 Strain on Middle Surface: Referring to figure S-3, consider an arc op on 
the Sa coordinate line that has an initial length of 
dSa = Ada. 
(S.23) 
After deformation, the points 0 and p move to 0' and p', and the arc length 
becomes 
ds~ = A'da. 
(S.24) 
= A(l + Ba)da. 
from equation (S.13). The extensional strain is defined as the relative increase 
in length of a curvilinear line element, or the final length minus the initial length, 
divided by the initial length. So, in the a. direction, we have 
ds~ - dSa 
dSa 
A(l + Ba) da. - Ada. 
Ada 
(S.2S) 
Thus Ra, which appeared in the coefficient of ta in equation (S.9) and is defined 
by equation (S.lOa), is the strain in the a direction. Correspondingly in the p 
direction, the strain is given by Bp, which is defined in equation (S.12a). We have 
thus found that the extensional strains occur quite naturally in the expressions 
for the derivatives of the position vector to the deformed middle surface. 
The in-plane shearing strain is defined as the change in angle between ta and 
tp during deformation. Referring to figure S-4, the shearing strain is 
(J) = eap + epa = sin(Bap + epa) 
= cos(i - eap- epa)

We form the indicated scalar product using equations (S.lS) and (S.16), which 
gives 
w = t~· tp = epa + eap + l/Jal/Jp 
(S.27) 
Since the last term is negligible, we have 
(S.28) 
as the shearing strain. Again, eap and epa are found among the coefficients of 
the equations defining the derivatives of the position vector of the deformed 
middle surface as equations (S.lOb) and (S.12b). The transverse shearing strains 
Ya and Yp have previously been defined.

Comparing equations (5.29) and (5.31), the Lame parameter for the parallel

For a parallel surface on a normal section along the sp coordinate line

(5.33) 
dsp«() = B(1 + ~Jdf3 
(5.34) 
and 
B«() = B(l + ~J 
(5.35) 
We recognize that the parallel surface is described by a system of curvilinear 
coordinates that is identical to those which describe the middle surface. There-
fore, the relationships between the strains and displacements defined for the 
middle surface in equations (5.10a) and (5.lOb) and (5.12a) and (5.12b) may be 
written for the parallel surface by replacing R"" Rp, A, and B by R",(n Rp(n 
A«(), and B«), respectively; and, by replacing D"" Dp, and Dn by D",(O, Dp(O, 
and Dn(n as defined in equations (5.20). 
For the extensional strains, we get

where DaP and Dpa are defined in equation (5.22). The terms Ka and Kp correspond 
to the familiar curvature terms in linear beam theory. For plates, they are indeed 
curvatures, but, for shells, they are more properly called changes in curvature, 
since shells by definition are initially curved. 
For the in-plane shearing strain w(o, we first combine eap and epa as indicated 
in equation (5.28). Adding equations (5.10b) and (5. 12b), we have

where T is called the twist or the torsion of the middle surface.

(5.42) 
(5.43)

We have now completely defined each strain on the parallel surface, except 
for the transverse shearing strain, as a linear combination of two terms: (a) the 
corresponding strain on the middle surface, which is expressed in terms of the 
middle surface displacements by one of equations (5.10) or (5.12); and (b) a change 

5.3 Strain 
217 
in curvature or a twist, which is, in turn, given in terms of the middle surface 
displacements by equations (5.38), (5.39), or (5.42)-(5.44), respectively. The trans-
verse shearing strains are also defined in terms of middle surface displacements 
by equations (5.22), (5.lOc), and (5.12c), but remain constant over the shell depth. 
The differences in the variation of the strains through the thickness when 
transverse shearing strains are included (linear vs. constant) give rise to a 
curious phenomenon known as shear locking in finite element models when 
numerical integrations through the thickness are required.4 If suitable pre-
cautions are not taken, this can lead to serious errors; this is one reason that 
solutions incorporating these strains have been slow to gain popularity. 
These relationships among strains, changes in curvature, and twist on the 
one hand, and the displacements of the middle surface on the other, are of 
primary importance in the theory of shells and are called generalized strain-
displacement or kinematic equations. We have thus established the second basic 
component of the elasticity problem as outlined in section 1.1, the conditions 
of compatibility of the strains and displacements, suitably specialized for the 
shell theory under consideration:

If we choose to neglect transverse shearing strains, we set y" = YP = 0 in 
equation (5.46), so that D"p = tjJ" and Dp" = tjJp. Then, replacing D"p and Dp" in 
equations (5.46d)-(5.46f) by tjJ" and tjJp, as given by equations (5.lOc) and (5.12c), 
we get the changes in curvatures directly in terms ofthe middle surface displace-
ments:

Note with respect to equations (5.46) and (5.47) that no force-deformation 
relationships are involved and, hence, linear material behavior is not a pre-
requisite for the application of these equations. Also, as previously demonstrated 
for the equilibrium equations, a considerable simplification of these equations 
often occurs for specific geometries through the elimination of some of the 
coupling terms.

5.4.2 Physical Interpretation: The first two equations of(S.48a-h) for the exten-
sional strains may be physically interpreted by considering figure S-6, which 
shows a segment of the meridian of a shell of revolution. The first term of 
equation (S.48a) follows from the basic definition of strain as the change in 
length of the differential segment op, Dtfi.tfi drjJ, divided by the initial length Rtfi drjJ. 
The second term of the equation represents the strain from the normal dis-
placement Dn; this is easily visualized as a change in the arc length op due to 
a change in Rtfi, (Rtfi + Dn) drjJ -
Rtfi drjJ, again divided by the initial length, Rtfi drjJ. 
In equation (S.48b), the first term is again straightforward. The remaining two 
terms occur because of the change in the radius of the parallel circle due to Dtfi 
and Dn, which is shown as Aoo' on figure S-6. The horizontal projection of Dtfi 
is Dtfi cos rjJ, and that of Dn is Dn sin rjJ. Together, we have the change in the length 
of the circular arc, (Dtfi cos rjJ + Dn sin rjJ) dO, divided by the original length, Ro dO. 
Next, we consider equations (S.48d) and (S.48e), the changes of the curvature. 
These are defined as the change in the surface rotations over the segments drjJ

and dO, respectively, divided by the length of the segments. Equation (5.48d) is 
the change in the rotation in the f/J direction, D"IJ, " df/J, divided by the arc length, 
R" df/J, or (l/R,,)D"IJ,'" We may also interpret this result directly in terms of 
the displacements by using figure 5-6. The rotation at the initial point in the 
segment, point 0, as it moves to o~ is (l/R")D,,. From o~ to 0;, we have the 
transverse shearing strain contribution of YIP' where the positive sense was 
established by figure 5-2. There is also a rotation at o~ due to Dn. This is 
illustrated in figure 5-7, where the same differential segment is shown with 
an exaggerated Dn displacement. The rotation at o~ due to the change in Dn is 
seen to be (l/R")Dn,,,-in a sense opposite that ofthe rotation due to D". Hence 
the total change in rotation over the segment 
(~D" + YIP - ~Dn,") df/J 
R" 
R" 
," 
is divided by the segment length, R" df/J, to derive the meridional change in 
curvature. This expression is verified by substituting equation (5.48g) into 
(5.48d). 
Equation (5.48e) has two components. The first term is the change in the 
rotation DIJ", DIJ",IJ dO, divided by the arc length, Ro dO, or (l/Ro)DIJ",IJ' Again, 
if a segment of the shell along a parallel circle is examined, this term may be

Fig.5-7 Normal Displacement of the Meridian 
interpreted directly in terms of the displacements. Note that there is a second 
term present in the expression for Ko. This term is (cos ,p/Ro)D",o, which acts 
about t",. The contribution of rotation D",o may be followed by referring to 
figure 3-6 and replacing the term NoR", d,p by D",o on the force element and on 
view HVI. Then, moving to view MV1, we see the resolution of this vector into 
the meridional direction and the normal direction. The drilling component, 
corresponding to rotation about the normal, is not admissible in the present 
theory. The meridional component, acting in the negative ,p direction, is the 
rotation D",o cos,p and represents a change in slope along the parallel circle 
over the segment. The sign of this component is positive since, as shown in 
figure 5-2(b) with IX = ,p and P = e, the positive sense of the rotation D",o points 
in the negative ,p direction. Mter division by the arc length, Ro de, we have 
the second term of equation (5.4Se). 
The preceding use of an argument from the equilibrium equations to explain 
a compatibility relationship is not an isolated coincidence. This is a represen-
tative part of a static-geometric analogy that exists between the equations of 
equilibrium and the equations of compatibility. This analogy is sometimes 
useful in constructing dual solutions. A complete development of the static-
geometric analogy may be found in Gol'denveizer.5 
We now turn our attention to the in-plane shearing strain w, which is given 
by equation (5.4Sc) and is shown on figure 5-S as the sum of w'" and Wo0 The

term w¢> is given by D¢>,8 de/(Ro de) = (1/Ro)D¢>,8' To evaluate w8, note that point 
p has moved a distance D8 + D8,¢> dfjJ in the e direction. When the e displacement 
of point 0, D8 , is projected onto the corresponding displacement of p to p', it 
becomes 
D8(RO + ~o,¢>#) = DB( 1 + R¢>;:SfjJ dfjJ) 
because of the change in the horizontal radius Ro. The difference, 
[D8,¢> -
D8(R¢>/Ro) cos fjJ] dfjJ 
R¢># 
= W8 
and the sum of w¢> and W8 is w, as given by equation (5.4Sc). 
Finally, we examine the twist ", which is given by equations (5.4Sf). Since" 
is obtained from "¢> and "B as defined in equation (5.44), we concentrate on 
the basic terms "¢> and "8' Referring to figures 5-S and 5-9(a), the twist in the fjJ 
direction, "¢>' is given by the change in the rotation in the e direction at 0' as 
fjJ varies, D8¢>,¢> dfjJ, divided by the arc length, R¢> dfjJ, which is the first term in 
equation (5.4Sf). The twist in the e direction, "8' consists partially of the 
corresponding change in the rotation in the fjJ direction at 0' as e varies, D¢>8,8 de, 
divided by the arc length, Ro de, as shown in figure 5-9(b). Another contribution 
to the twist in the e direction is due to the change in the horizontal radius 
Ro as fjJ changes. From equation (5.4Sh), D8¢> is approximately inversely pro-
portional to Ro so that DB¢> is reduced to

After division by the arc length over which the change in horizontal radius

We have attempted to provide an explanation of the individual terms of 
the compatibility equations by using physical arguments for the specialized 
shell of revolution geometry. In a general shell, the physical illustrations would 
become untenable; yet, the initial derivation by vector algebra was straight-
forward. In the past, considerable effort has been expended in deriving compati-
bility relationships for specialized geometries using strictly physical reasoning. 
Here, in both the equilibrium and compatibility treatments, we have sought to 
vary the approach somewhat by initially deemphasizing the physical in favor 
of the mathematical approach, but then closely supporting the results with 
specific physical illustrations. 
5.5 Strain-Displacement Relations for Plates 
As initially set forth in section 3.4, the shell equations are transformed into a 
sufficiently general form for medium-thin plates by letting the radii of curvature

It has been noted several times that the adoption of assumption [3J and 
the subsequent suppression of transverse shearing strains generally leads to 
significant mathematical simplifications. An example of this may be seen for 
the plate case by comparing equations (S.S4d)-(S.S4f) with equations (S.SSa)-
(S.SSc). In the latter equations, the curvatures and hence the entire flexural 
behavior of the shell are dependent on only the normal displacement DR and 
are essentially uncoupled from the extensional behavior. The form of the 
curvature-displacement relations is identical to that encountered in elementary 
beam theory. On the other hand, the retention of transverse shearing strains 

226

leads to a considerably more complicated mathematical formulation. 6 This is 
discussed further in chapter 8.

Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions,

6.1 Constitutive Laws 
The constitutive law or stress-strain relationship is the third basic component of 
the elasticity problem. This subject is quite broad, but the detailed examination 
of various alternatives that are dependent on the characteristics of particular 
engineering materials is not properly within the scope of this book. Rather, 
it remains within the purview of the theory of elasticity, since we may accom-
modate a variety of material laws within our formulation of the shell or plate 
problem. Initially, we use the basic Hooke's law for isotropic materials, and 
then we illustrate how some extended material laws can be accommodated.

thermal expansion, which will be taken as piecewise constant, and T(oc, p, 0 = 
the temperature, measured from a specified reference value. Thermal effects are 
included snce they are very important in some applications. 1

We find it convenient to invert equation (6.1) and substitute the expressions 
8,,(a, fl, 0, 8p(a, fl, 0, and w(a, fl, 0, as given by equations (5.36), (5.37), and (5.45), 
respectively. After performing the indicated substitutions and assuming for the 
present that Gn = G = E/[2(1 + Jl)], we obtain the stress-strain law 
{a(a, fl, ()} = [CJ{ £(0(, fl, ()) - {aT(a, fl· ()} 
(6.2) 
which is given in det.ail in matrix 6-1. 
We use the matrix representation to illustrate that any other consistent 
stress-strain relationship may be accommodated by altering the elements of 
[C] and {aT}, which are essentially independent from the remainder of the 
development. 
6.1.1.2 Stress Resultant-Strain and Stress Couple-Curvature Relations. In the 
surface structure problem, the constitutive equations are required to relate the 
stress resultants and stress couples, instead of merely stresses, to the corresponding 
strains and curvatures. These relationships are obtained in a straightforward 
fashion. We substitute the stress-strain law, matrix 6-1, into equations (3.6)-
(3.9). For example, consider the expression for N" in equation (3.6): 
f, "/2

and where the shear moduli are now assumed to be related by Gn = AG. A, 
sometimes called the shear correction factor or the transverse warping shape 
factor, is relatively complex to define explicitly, but is commonly taken as 5/6 
for isotropic shells. 2 
Matrix 6-2 in the form 
(6.10) 
which serves to illustrate again that more complex material properties, expressed 
through a modification of the stress-strain law [CJ, can be represented through 
a corresponding generalization of [DJ without affecting the remaining develop-
ment. Similarly, the {NT} matrix can be suitably altered if {aT} is changed. We 
consider some of these possibilities in the next section. Furthermore, we must 
emphasize that two terms of [DJ, D33 and D66 , often appear in slightly different 
forms, modified by a factor of2. This arises because of the somewhat ambiguous 
definitions of wand 't" as given in equations (5.28) and (5.44); there is little 
consensus on whether w should be defined as in equation (5.28), or as one-half 
of that quantity. Similarly, the factor of 1/2 introduced into the definition of 
't" could be omitted. The only requirement is to maintain consistency in the 
constitutive matrix, and [DJ, as given in Matrix 6-2, is correct in this regard. 
Also, note that for plates with no in-plane loading, the first three rows and 
columns of matrix 6-2 may be deleted. If transverse shearing strains are not 
included in the formulation-either for shells or for plates-the last two rows 
and columns are not relevant; rather, the transverse shear resultants are ob-
tained from the fourth and fifth equilibrium equations, (3.22a) and (3.22b), once 
the stress couples are computed. 
It is also of interest to note that although the transverse shear resultants are 
readily computed from the last two equations in matrix 6-2, the corresponding 
stresses in matrix 6-1 violate the stress-free conditions on the faces ± h/2, since 
Yo< and YP are constant through the thickness. This has been a major con-
sideration in the formulation of a consistent theory of plates, as discussed later 
in section 8.6.4. However, within the context of our treatment, this violation is 
only at the point (elasticity) level and may be circumvented by computing the 
shear stresses directly from the stress resultants, as described in equations 
(3.10). 
6.1.2 Specifically Orthotropic Materials: A generalization of the isotropic con-
dition which is of interest to us is the specifically orthotropic material. The strict 
definition of this configuration is that elastic properties are specified along two 
mutually orthogonal material axes, whereas the shell still retains the piecewise 
constant thickness and cross-sectional symmetry presumed so far in this text. 
Further, it is assumed in our development that the orthogonal material axes

The elements of matrix [Cor] are generally determined experimentally. 
[Cor] may be used to derive a corresponding stress resultant-strain matrix 
[Dor] and a corresponding thermal load vector {NTor } by following the same 
procedure described in section 6.1.1.2. We also redefine the thermal coefficients 
and transverse warping shape factors to permit different values in each direc-
tion. The resulting generalization of equation (6.10) is

6.1 Constitutive Laws

For homogeneous shells, the integrals in matrix 6-3 and equations (6.13a-d) 
are easily evaluated in explicit form. For multilayered sections, the integrals 
may be computed by summing over the thickness. Multilayered shells and 
plates are widely used in applications of high-performance materials. For such 
layered shells, the shape factors A./X and A.{J are determined for specific cases 
by Dong and Tso,3 through correlation with selected reference solutions based 
on the theory of elasticity. A complete bibliography on the calculation of shape 
factors for layered plates and shells is also given there. 
6.1.3 Stiffened Shells and Plates and Reticulated Shells: There are two addi-
tional structural systems which are neither shells nor plates by the strict defini-
tion, but may be conveniently treated as such. These are (a) shells or plates to 
which discrete stiffeners, surface undulations, or folds have been added to 
supplement the strength and/or rigidity of the basic constant thickness section; 
and, (b) frames composed of intersecting grids of closely spaced members that 
follow the topography of a curved surface. Such frameworks are termed shell-
like structures or reticulated shells and combine the favorable structural char-
acteristics of the basic geometric form with the use of efficient prefabricated 
components, requiring little or no falsework for erection.4 The ancient Pantheon 
(figure 1-3) is a stiffened shell; the contemporary Astrodome in Houston, Texas 
(figure 2-8 [m]), is a reticulated shell. 
Although it is theoretically possible to model these relatively complex sys-
tems as ensembles of the various constituent components, it is often feasible, 
considerably simpler, and more economical to use surface structure equations. 
Naturally, the question arises as to the appropriate value for the "thickness" 
since, by definition, a shell or plate has a piecewise constant or smoothly varying 
thickness. It appears to be proper to consider this question at the level of the 
stress resultant-strain relationships, matrix [D], rather than at the stress-strain 
level, matrix [C], since the latter matrix is based on the stress-at-a-point focus 
of the theory of elasticity-which obviously has little meaning when we must 
consider equivalent thicknesses. 
A fairly common and quite illustrative example is that of a shell or plate with 
equispaced stiffening ribs running in one direction, as shown in figure 6-1, or 
in both directions. A common method of treating this problem is to combine 
the properties of the basic shell or plate and the stiffener over a repeating 
interval of the cross section, such as d{J' and then to compute an equivalent 
thickness in the direction of the stiffener. This process is often referred to by 
the colloquial title of verschmieren, after the German verb "to smear over." 
For a shell which behaves essentially in accordance with membrane theory, 
the equivalent thickness is logically computed with respect to the extensional 
rigidity, whereas for a plate subjected to bending, it would be based on the 
flexural rigidity. 
To illustrate such a computation, consider the situation shown in figure 6-1. 
For a shell, we compute the area of the repeating cross section, hd{J + lib, and

(6.14) 
In the other direction, we use hp = h. If the stiffened structure is a plate acting 
primarily in bending, we would compute the moment of inertia of the repeating 
T section about its centroidal axis, 1Mi. Then, the equivalent thickness her is found 
from setting 
(6.15a) 
or 
h = (121hii)1/3 
" 
dp 
(6.15b) 
The thickness in the {J direction is again taken as hp = h. 
The equivalent thicknesses are then used to compute the corresponding terms 
of matrix [D]. Referring to the elements of matrix 6-2, we would use her to 
compute the terms in the first and fourth rows, and hp for the terms in the second 
and fifth rows. It has been suggested 5 that the terms corresponding to the 
shearing rigidity (rows three, seven, and eight) be evaluated by using the basic 

6.1 Constitutive Laws 
235 
thickness h, whereas the twisting rigidity (row six) may be computed using 
the basic thickness or, in some cases, be neglected altogether. This technique 
may be easily extended to cases in which the stiffeners run in both directions 
by computing appropriate hp thicknesses from formulas analogous to equations 
(6.14) and (6.15). A form of a plate supplemented by beams running in two 
directions known as a waffle slab (figure 2-8[w]) is quite widely used in reinforced 
concrete building construction. 
This simple illustration of a verschmieren procedure raises several questions 
which we consider at this point. If only one equivalent thickness is defined in 
each direction, should it be the extensional or the flexural thickness for a shell 
that may have significant bending? We have opted for the extensional, but will 
this equivalent thickness adequately represent the flexural characteristics of 
the stiffened shell? Also, what about the shearing and twisting thicknesses? To 
include only the basic shell or plate, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, 
seems to be a rather crude approximation. Finally, the use of different equiv-
alent thicknesses in the at: and f3 directions for the extensional and bending 
rigidities would cause matrix [D] to be unsymmetric because of the off-diagonal 
terms in rows one, two, four, and five. This leads to contradictions and com-
putational difficulties that should be avoided. 
From the preceding questions, it is obvious that a procedure which embodies 
more of the characteristics of the actual structure is desirable. This is especially 
true as the stiffeners become more prominent with respect to the basic cross 
section, up to the case of reticulated structures, where they may constitute 
practically the entire means of resisting the primary forces and moments. 
A promising approach for this problem is the split rigidity concept introduced 
by Buchert.4 The method is a generalization of a development by E. Reissner, 
who has been one of the most prolific contributors to the theory of shells in the 
middle and late twentieth century.6 Essentially, different equivalent thicknesses 
for the extensional, shearing, bending, and twisting terms may be specified. To 
avoid difficulties with nonsymmetry in [D], Poisson's ratio is neglected. This 
leads to a diagonal matrix [Deq], which replaces [D] in equation (6.10):

The additional subscripts (m) and (b) indicate membrane or extensional and 
bending or flexural, respectively. 
To illustrate the split rigidity concept, we choose a reticulated shell composed 
of a gridwork of structural members, as shown in figure 6-2. The members are 
assumed to have locally constant spacing, d,. and dp; areas A,. and Ap; moments 
of inertia I,. and Ip; and St. Venant torsion constants K,. and K p, in each 
direction. Any infilled material between the main members is assumed to be 
either restricted to local loading distribution, and therefore negligible in this 
analysis, or included in the section properties of the main members. 
With these idealizations, we may immediately compute

The equivalent in-plane shear thickness is a bit harder to visualize. A first 
approximation, considering only the primary members of the frame, would be 
to take the average of the equivalent extensional thicknesses, t[h,,(rn) + hp(rn)], 
so that

We note that there is the possibility of increasing the in-plane shear resistance 
substantially through the integration of the infilling material with the primary 
frame structure. 
Now, we turn to the equivalent flexural thicknesses. Considering the Q( 
direction first, we equate the moments of inertia per unit width of the frame 
member and the equivalent shell

Similarly, in the fJ direction 
hp(b) = (12 ~)

(6.21) 
Last, we turn to the equivalent twisting thickness. It is in this mode of resis-
tance that a shell-like structure often differs most from a true shell. Whereas 
a true shell or plate has relatively great twisting rigidity as compared with 
the flexural rigidity, the reticulated structure is likely to have comparatively 
little twisting rigidity, especially if it comprises thin-walled members with open 
cross section. 
In his study of orthotropic plates, Huffington suggested a procedure based 
on the St. Venant torsional rigidity of the members. 7 This is, by no means, 
a general solution; however, it serves to illustrate a rational approach applicable 
to a specific class of problems. It is likely that the twisting rigidity will be of 
greater significance in plates, which behave in a primarily flexural mode and 
may have little influence on shell-like forms. Since we are following a general 
course applicable to shells as well, we take only the average extensional thick-
ness for computing the twisting rigidity. Therefore, 
(6.22) 
(6.23) 
The use of an equivalent stress resultant-strain matrix, such as the one 
defined here, enables a large variety of curved frames and gridworks to be 
efficiently analyzed by using solutions based on shell and plate theories, i.e., by 
using a continuum as opposed to a discrete approach. We must remember, 
however, that the stress resultants and couples computed from such solutions 
are intensities per unit length of middle surface and must subsequently be con-
verted to forces and moments in the individual members. A logical procedure 
for accomplishing this conversion is to take the average value of the stress 
resultant or couple over a repeating interval, d" or dp, multiplied by the interval. 
6.2 Boundary Conditions 
6.2.1 Role of Boundary Conditions in the Formulation of Shell and Plate Theories: 
In the preceding section, we have presented the constitutive laws that serve to 
connect the equilibrium equations derived in chapter 3 and the compatibility 
relations developed in chapter 5. The classical formulation of the solid me-
chanics problem embodies these three components, which may be collected as 
a set of partial differential equations or as an energy principle. We explore both 

238 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
ofthese formats in depth in the succeeding chapters; however, there is one more 
ingredient necessary to complete the theory in either case: a suitable set of 
boundary conditions. The possibilities may be classified as follows: (a) static 
(a stress resultant or stress couple is specified; (b) kinematic (a displacement 
or rotation is specified); and (c) elastic (a linear combination of a static and 
a kinematic quantity is specified). This may be represented by a spring-type 
support. 
In the following discussion, we place two restrictions on the boundary con-
ditions to simplify the formulation somewhat: (a) all boundaries coincide with 
either an Sa or sp coordinate line and, (b) all kinematic boundary conditions are 
homogeneous. Exceptions to the first restriction include such problems as skew 
intersections and cutouts and are best treated using discrete approximation 
techniques such as the finite element method. Nonhomogeneous boundary 
conditions are not necessarily more difficult to deal with than the homogeneous 
variety, but since they occur comparatively infrequently, it is usually expedient 
to exclude this possibility from the general formulation and to treat such 
situations that may arise as special cases. 
6.2.2 Static and Kinematic Boundary Conditions: We consider two representative 
boundaries of a surface in figure 6-3. The boundary coinciding with the Sa coor-
dinate line is located by f3 = 11, and the boundary along the sp coordinate line 
is designated by 0( = a. On the boundary 0( = a, there are five static quantities 
acting: Na, Nap, Qa, M a, and Map. Also, there are five kinematic components 
present: Da, Dp, Dm DaP' and Dpa. Note that each static quantity performs work 
through one and only one kinematic quantity within the small deformation 
theory. We group the associated quantities as static-kinematic correspondents 
as listed on figure 6-3. For the boundary f3 = 11, the correspondents are also 
given on the figure. This pairing is quite important, for at any point on either 
boundary, only one of each pair of static-kinematic correspondents may be 
specified-except for an elastic boundary represented by a linear combination 
of the two. In no case, however, may both or neither of the correspondents 
be designated on a boundary. Further, when one correspondent is specified, 
the other must be accommodated by the boundary; e.g., if a displacement, such 
as Da, is set equal to 0, the boundary must resist whatever value of Na is 
calculated from the subsequent solution; or if the stress resultant Na = 0, the 
boundary must be free to displace through the computed Da. In the case of 
static boundary conditions, nonzero values are often prescribed as a known 
loading term, i.e., in figure 4-12, Nz(O) = - N. 
Before examining some specialized forms of the boundary conditions, we 
should mention one further requirement, the elimination of rigid body displace-
ments. To accomplish this, it is sufficient that Da, Dp, Dm Dap, and Dpa each be 
restrained to vanish at one point on the surface. Seemingly, we would also need 
to restrict the drilling rotation (about the normal), even though this degree of 
freedom is not germane to the theory. There are also certain cases when the

6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
Recognize that the terms used to describe the boundaries-e.g., hinged and 
roller-are essentially two-dimensional in implication and do not fully describe 
the constraint in the f3 direction. Consequently, the conditions on Dp, and/or 
Dpa may be interchanged with NaP and/or Map, respectively, if the physical 
situation seems appropriate. Also, the term simply supported is often imprecisely 
used to also describe the hinged or roller cases. Technically, this condition 
should be reserved for beam-like situations for which a meridional constraint 
is not necessary. A similar set of conditions can be derived for the boundary 
f3 = 11. 
6.2.3 Kirchhoff Boundary Conditions: We have mentioned several times that 
much of the classical theory of shells and plates is based on the suppression 
of the transverse shearing strains. From the statement of the admissible bound-
ary conditions presented in the preceding section, we can anticipate that the 
most general system of governing differential equations is of tenth order in 
each direction, permitting prescription of five conditions on each of the four 
boundaries. When transverse shearing strains are not included, the governing 
equations are reduced to eighth order in each direction, and a contracted set 
of boundary conditions is required. 
The derivation of the static conditions consistent with the suppression of 
transverse shearing strains is one of the more interesting theoretical problems 
in the theories of shells and plates. These are commonly known as the Kirchhoff 
boundary conditions after the noted mathematician G. Kirchhoff, who first

estabiished the correct relationships for a plate using an energy formulation. 8 
Although Kirchhoff's derivation served to clarify the situation somewhat, it 
was mathematical in basis, and it remained for two distinguished nineteenth-
century scientists, Lord Kelvin and P. Tait,9 to provide a physical interpretation 
of the Kirchhoff conditions. 
To illustrate the Kelvin-Tait argument and to provide an extension into 
the shell formulation, refer to the ex = a boundary as shown on figure 6-4. We 
show four adjacent differential half-segments ab, bo, oc and cd, each of length 
!J.sp/2, and indicate the resultant forces acting on segment boc due to N",p and 
Q",. These resultants act at point o. Also, we show the resultant couples on 
two adjacent segments, abo and oed, due to M",p. These act at points band 
c, respectively. The directions shown correspond to the sign convention of 
figure 3-2. Now, in figure 6-5, we examine a normal section showing the middle 
surface of the differential segment and replace the moments due to the stress 
couples by equivalent forces at a, 0, and d. The replacement of a moment on 
the boundary by a pair of equal and opposite forces separated by a differential 
distance is justified by the St. Venant principle, 1 0 one of the many enduring con-
tributions of this outstanding nineteenth-century scientist. From M",p, we have 
the forces (M",p!J.sp)/!J.sp = M",p acting at a and 0 normal to the chord ao. From 
M",p + M",p,p!J.{3, we derive a similar pair of forces acting normal t~ chord od. 
Also shown by dashed vectors are the effective in-plane shear N",p and the 
effective transverse shear Q. which we wish to evaluate at point o.

For the corresponding kinematic conditions, we first examine equations (5.46g) 
and (5.46h) with YIZ = Yp = O. Then DIZP and DplZ, corresponding to the bending 
couples, are equal to "'17. and "'p, respectively. For the effective shear stresses, 
which incorporate the twisting couples, we have Dp and Dn on the IX = (X 
boundary, and DIZ and Dn on the P = P boundary. These are also listed on 
figure 6-3. 
6.2.4 Boundary Conditions for Plates with No Transverse Shearing Strains: 
Although the general boundary conditions described in section 6.2.2 are ap-
plicable for plates as well as shells, the Kirchhoff conditions are somewhat 
simplified for plates. An examination of equations (6.24) and (6.26) reveals Rp 
and RIZ in the denominators of the twisting stress couple terms, M IZP and M plZ. 

6.2 Boundary Conditions

Since these radii ~ 00, the effective in-plane shear is superfluous, and we are 
left with only the effective transverse shears, as given by equations (6.25) and 
(6.27). 
6.2.5 Boundary Conditions for Shells of Revolution: The shell of revolution 
geometry was specialized in section 2.8.2, with the meridians corresponding to 
the Sa. coordinate lines and the parallel circles to the sp coordinate lines. For 
this shell form, we only have boundary conditions along the parallel circles. If 
the meridional coordinate is taken as </J, and the circumferential coordinate as 
e, a parallel circle boundary corresponds to </J = (j. The Kirchhoff conditions 
follow from equations (6.24) and (6.25) as

6.2.6 Symmetry: In addition to external boundary conditions such as those 
we have discussed in the preceding paragraphs, there may be equations of 
condition that arise because of symmetry properties of both the geometry 
and the loading. The practical manifestation of the recognition of symmetry 
conditions is that only a part of the entire continuum must be analyzed. 
A fairly general modern treatment of the topic of symmetry was presented 
by Glockner,ll and we focus here on the applications to shells and plates. 
Of course, we have already used the concept of symmetry extensively in our 
treatment of shells of revolution as a distinct class of surface structures. Such 
shells are distinguished geometrically by their rotational symmetry. Further, 
in the analysis by the Fourier series technique in chapter 4, symmetric and 
anti symmetric components of the loading were identified. Formally, we may 
state that a loading function q(x) is symmetric about x = 0 if q( -x) = q(x), and 
antisymmetric if q( -x) = -q(x). Furthermore, higher harmonic components, 
which are self-equilibrated, are said to possess cyclic symmetry. This was 
illustrated by the column-supported shell solution in section 4.3.7.3. 
As a first illustration, consider a complete rotational shell, such as a sphere 
or an ellipsoid subject to a uniform normal pressure qn = q. Using the notation 
of figures 4-2 and 6-3, the following symmetry conditions may be enforced at 
</J = n12: 
D,p = 0; 
Q,p = 0 
These conditions require that only half of the shell be represented in the ensuing 
analysis. This may not be important in a membrane theory analysis which is 
statically determinate~e.g., equations (4.27) and (4.28)~but may result in 

244 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
considerable savings when an analysis using the general theory is performed. 
In some numerical solutions, it also may be necessary to enforce such symmetry 
conditions to eliminate rigid body displacements. 
Another case of interest is a shell of translation, such as the elliptic paraboloid 
shown in figure 4-51(a) subject to a uniform vertical loading qz = q. We may 
consider only the quadrant OEDF and, using the notation of figure 4-40, take 
0( = x and f3 = yon figure 6-3. Then, we have 
along OF and 
Dy = 0; 
Nyx = 0; 
Qy = 0; 
Dyx = 0; 
Myx = 0 
along OE. It is possible to affect further savings by defining symmetry along 
the diagonal OD, but since this involves displacements along non-principal lines 
of curvature, it lies outside our present scope. The conditions for the shell of 
translation are also applicable to uniformly loaded, symmetrically supported 
plates. 
. 
As a final example, we choose the same elliptic paraboloid illustrated in 
figure 4-51(a) subjected to a hydrostatic loading acting normal to the X-Y 
plane. The distribution in the Y direction is given by 
(b -
Y) 
qAX, Y) = q 
2 
and the loading is assumed to be uniform across the X direction. This loading 
is readily decomposed into a constant component (j = 0) 
and a linear component (j = 1) 
Y 
q}(X, Y) = -q2 
The constant component q~ is symmetrical with respect to both the X and 
Yaxes, and is treated identically to the previous example. The linear component 
q} remains symmetric with respect to the Yaxis, so the conditions along OF 
are unaltered. However, this component is anti symmetric with respect to the 
X axis, since qi(X, - Y) = - qi(X, Y). The resulting conditions along OE are 
Ny = 0; 
Dx = 0; 
D. = 0; 
My = 0; 
Dxy = 0 
which are the correspondents of the conditions on a line of loading symmetry 
in each case. Again, the anti symmetry conditions are applicable to plates as 
well. 

6.3 Membrane Theory Displacements

6.3 Membrane Theory Displacements 
6.3.1 General Aspects: In the preceding sections of this chapter, we have com-
pleted the derivation of the individual components required to formulate the 
general theories of shells and plates. In chapter 4, we investigated a very 
important class of problems, the membrane theory of shells, which requires only 
the solution of a reduced set of equilibrium equations to determine the in-plane 
stress resultants. The membrane theory is generally statically determinate as 
opposed to the general theory, which is statically indeterminate and therefore 
requires simultaneous consideration of equilibrium, compatibility, and con-
stitutive relations. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the membrane solution is 
complete until the displacements are determined. As is the usual procedure for 
statically determinate problems, we may compute these displacements from the 
equilibrium solution, assuming that the stress field is known. 
At the outset, it is instructive to consider the relevance of the membrane 
theory displacements in shell analysis and design. First, since the design of 
many shells is based on the membrane theory, the magnitudes of the associated 
displacements would be useful to verify the applicability of small displacement 
theory (assumption [2], table 1-1). Also, knowledge of the expected displace-
ments can be important in providing a supporting system to accommodate 
the required boundary deformations, as mentioned in the previous section. 
Further, it is possible to obtain values for the bending stress resultants and 
couples by substituting the membrane theory displacements into the general 
strain-displacement and constitutive equations, equations (5.46) or (5.47), and 
equation (6.10), respectively. At best, the values obtained in this manner may 
be useful for order-of-magnitude estimation in the regions of the shell domi-
nated by membrane action, but do not account for boundary effects. 
Next, even if a solution is obtained using a bending theory, the values of 
the in-plane stress resultants are often not changed significantly from those 
computed from a membrane theory analysis except, perhaps, in localized re-
gions. Since certain of the stress resultants, such as Ntfo in symmetrically and 
anti symmetrically loading shells of revolution, are dependent on the overall 
equilibrium of the shell, they cannot be altered very much by bending action. 
This means that the middle surface displacements, which are primarily functions 
of the in-plane stress resultants, may be estimated quite closely from the 
membrane theory solution. 
Additionally, we may anticipate that a logical procedure to analyze shells 
which do not fully meet the requirements of the membrane theory because of 
inappropriate boundary conditions, would be to use the flexibility method. 
An example would be a spherical shell, such as that illustrated in figure 4-2, 
with the lower boundary pinned or fixed, as defined in section 6.2. Briefly, 
the flexibility method consists of introducing a sufficient number of kinematic 
releases into the system to make it statically determinate. Then, the conditions 
of deformation compatibility consistent with the original system constraints 

246 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
are enforced on superposed primary and secondary systems to determine the 
static correspondents of the kinematic releases, known as the redundants. This 
procedure is familiar to students of structural mechanics and is described in 
most standard texts on the analysis of indeterminate structures, so we need 
not elaborate here. Briefly, we note that the compatibility equations take the 
form 
{A} = {X} + [F] {X} 
(6.30) 
where 
{ A} = the vector of the displacements corresponding to each of the releases 
on the original structure. Commonly, {A} is null. 
{X} = the vector of the displacements of each of the releases due to the 
applied loading. These displacements are computed on the released 
(now statically determinate) structure. 
{X} = the vector of the statical correspondents of the kinematic releases, 
the redundants, initially unknown. For plates and shells, the ele-
ments of {X} are usually transverse shear forces and moments on 
the boundary. 
[F] = the matrix of flexibility influence coefficients, each element of which 
is a displacement of a release due to a unit value of one of the 
elements of {X}. The influence coefficients are computed on the 
released, statically determinate, structure. 
Once {X} and [F] are computed and {A} is specified, we solve for 
{X} = [F-l][{A} - {A}] 
(6.31) 
For shells, {X} can usually be evaluated with sufficient accuracy by using the 
membrane theory, as discussed in the previous paragraph. The elements of [F], 
being displacements due to boundary transverse shear forces and bending 
moments, must still be computed by using the bending theory; however, since 
no surface loads are involved, only the homogeneous bending equations need 
be considered, which frequently simplifies the solution. A specific illustration 
of this method is presented in chapter 9 for the bending analysis of cylindrical 
shells. 
Thus, we have suggested a variety of reasons for studying the middle surface 
displacements of shells in equilibrium under a known internal stress field 
computed by the membrane theory. 
6.3.2 Governing Equations: To connect the middle surface displacements Da., 
Dp, and Dn with the stress resultants Na., Np, and Na.p, compare equations (5.46a)-
(5.46c) with the first three rows of matrix 6-2. Since matrix 6-2 gives the stress 
resultants as functions of strain, we must invert the relations 
(6.32a) 

6.3 Membrane Theory Displacements 
Np = /lD 16" + D16p -
NPT 
S = D2 w 
247 
(6.32b) 
(6.32c) 
recalling that N"p is replaced by S in the membrane theory. From matrix 6-2, 
Dl = Ehj(1 -
/l2) and D2 = Ehj[2(1 + /l)]. Solving for the strains in view of 
equations (6. 1 a), (6.1b) and (6.9a), we have 
1 
6" = Eh [(N" - /lNp) + (1 - /l)NT] 
(6.33a) 
1 
6p = Eh [(Np - /IN,,) + (1 - /l)NT] 
W = 2(1 + /l) S 
Eh 
(6.33b) 
(6.33c) 
By equating the r.h.s. of equations (S.46a-c) and equations (6.33a-c), we arrive 
at the complete set of equations relating the displacements and the stress 
resultants. With these stress resultants having been determined by using the 
methods of chapter 4, we have three partial differential equations in the three 
unknown middle surface displacements, D", Dp, and Dn. 
We may also obtain expressions for the rotations D"p and Dp" in terms of 
the middle surface displacements from equations (S.46g) and (S.46h), if we 
neglect the transverse shearing strains. This is consistent with the membrane 
theory where Q" and Qp are assumed to be zero. 
Many forms used for shell structures facilitate simplifications in the func-
tional dependence of the geometrical parameters. Therefore, it is expedient to 
specialize the equations for specific geometrical types. 
6.3.3 Shells of Revolution 
6.3.3.1 Transformation of Governing Equations. Since we have already special-
ized the strain-displacement relations for shells of revolution with ex = t/J and 
f3 = () in section S.4, we have from equations (S.48a-c) and (6.33a-c)

(6.34c) 
Since the stress resultants and thermal loads are both presumed to be known 
at this stage, we drop the thermal terms, which can simply be absorbed into 
N", and No if present. 
Now, we return to the technique of section 4.3.1, whereby a judiciously 
chosen set of auxiliary variables was used to reduce the set of equations. Again, 

248

we follow Novozhilov 12 by introducing 
IjI = DIJ 
Ro 
¢ = Dt/> 
sin¢ 
(6.35a) 
(6.35b) 
Next, we substitute equations (6.35a) and (6.35b) into equations (6.34a-c) and 
eliminate Dn between the first two equations, giving 
-
RIJ -

These equations may be compared with the transformed equilibrium equations, 
(4.6b) and (4.6a), respectively. We see that the l.h.s. of both would be identical 
if we were to interchange", and 1jI, and ~ and ¢; whereas, the r.h.s., in both cases, 
consist entirely of known functions. Therefore, whatever solution strategies 
were deduced for the membrane theory equilibrium equations are applicable for 
the equations governing the corresponding displacements. Also, we recognize 
that once ¢ and IjI are determined, Dt/> and DIJ follow from equations (6.35a), 
and (6.35b) and Dn may be calculated from equation (6.34a) or (6.34b). 
As a practical matter, when we attempt to use the various solutions already 
derived in chapter 4 for the determination of the corresponding displacements, 
we soon realize that the r.h.s. of equations (6.34a-c) are likely to be more 
complicated algebraically than the corresponding functions in the equilibrium 
equations. This is because the expressions for the stress resultants are already 
quite involved for some of the cases that we solved in chapter 4. After being 
multiplied by the radii of curvature expressions on the r.h.s., integrals that can 
only be evaluated numerically are often produced. This slight complication 
notwithstanding, the similarity of the system of governing equations for the 
membrane theory stress resultants in terms of the known applied loading, 
on the one hand, and the in-plane displacements and the computed stress 
resultants on the other, is quite striking. This serves as another example of 
the static-geometric analogy mentioned in section 5.4.2. 
Once we have evaluated the in-plane displacements, we may compute the 
rotations from equations (5.48g) and (5.48h) with Yt/> = Yo = 0:

We now find it convenient to again consider the axisymmetric (j = 0) and 
nonsymmetric (j > 0) cases separately. 

6.3 Membrane Theory Displacements

6.3.3.2 Axisymmetric Displacements. We drop the O-dependent terms from 
equations (6.36) and (6.37) and integrate the first two of the set. Following 
section 4.3.2.1 and using equation (6.34b), we find

(6.38e) 
The indefinite integrals in equations (6.38a) and (6.38b) may be written in 
the alternate form 
(6.39a) 
(6.39b) 
where ¢", and ¢"" are the boundaries at which Dq) and Do are specified. We have 
used ¢", and ¢"" to emphasize that these boundaries are not the same bound-
aries where the corresponding stress resultants are specified, ¢' and ¢", as 
identified in equations (4.10) and (4.11). Recalling the arguments of section 6.2.2, 
we cannot specify Nq) and Dq), nor S and Do on the same boundary. Moreover, 
since we have presumably specified the boundary values Nq)(¢') and S(¢") in 
the equilibrium solution, Dq) and Do must be imposed at the other boundary in 
each case. Thus, we have little latitude in the choice for ¢", and ¢"". 
When Ro is not finite, as for ¢ = 0 on a toroidal shell, equation (6.38c) is not 
applicable, but an alternate equation for Dn can be found from equation (6.34a). 
For a dome, we again encounter indeterminate forms for Dq) and Do at the 
pole. It is easily shown using L'Hospital's rule that Dq)(O) = Do(O) = O. Then, 
equations (6.38a-c) gives 
(6.40) 

250 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
As an example, we investigate a spherical dome under dead load, using the 
solution for stresses derived in section 4.3.2.2 and referring to figure 4-2 with 
(A = O. We wish to compute the displacement normal to the middle surface, Dn , 
at the lower boundary rP = rPb' 
Examining equation (6.38c) we observe that since D",(rPb) = 0 as dictated by 
the requirement to develop N",(rh,) fully, we need only the values of N", and No 
at rP = rPb' From equations (4.20) and (4.21), we have 
qa 
(6.41) 
and 
NO(rPb) = qa (1 
1 
rP - cos rPb) 
+ cos b 
(6.42) 
We substitute these values into equation (6.38c) with Ro = a, to get 
qa2 ( 
1 + J-L 
) 
Dn(rh,) = -h 
t/J - cos rPb 
E 
1 + cos b 
(6.43) 
At the pole, the normal displacement is found using equations (4.22) and 
(6.40): 
_qa2 
Dn(O) = 2Eh (1 -
J-L) 
(6.44) 
As a further example, we consider the displacements of a hyperboloidal 
shell under self-weight load, previously analyzed in section 4.3.2.3. Referring to 
equations (6.38a) and (6.38b), since S = 0, IfJ is O. Then, ~ is evaluated from 
equation (6.39a), with equations (4.40) and (4.41) substituted for N", and No 
and rP'" taken as rPb' The resulting integral is quite complicated, but it is easily 
evaluated using a numerical algorithm, such as the trapezoidal method. Finally, 
Dn is found from equation (6.38c). 
A study of the displacements for a parametric range of hyperboloidal shell 
dimensions, similar to that shown on figure 4-8 for the stress resultants, is given 
in figure 6-6. The nondimensionalizing parameters are indicated on the figure. 
Also a complete tabulation is available in Gould. 13 
6.3.3.3 Nonsymmetric Loading. To complete the analogous treatment of the 
equations of equilibrium and compatibility, we apply to equations (6.36b) and 
(6.36a), respectively, the procedure initially used to obtain equation (4.85) from 
equations (4.6a) and (4.6b) in section 4.3.5.1. The result is

All strains and displacements have previously been expressed in harmonic 
form by equations (S.SO) and (S.SI), and the corresponding strain-displacement 
relations have been written as equations (S.S2). With the stress resultants having 
been expanded in Fourier series in equation (4.86b), equations (6.34a-c) are 
easily written in separated form. Further, we take the variables IfI and ~ as 
{:} = j~O {~~::;:} 
(6.46) 
and the separated form of equation (6.4S), analogous to equation (4.88), is

The final major equation for the displacements corresponds to the anti-
symmetrical case, j = 1, earlier discussed in section 4.3.6. Following the same 

252 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
steps used in section 4.3.6.1, we introduce the variable 
Y(¢) = ljI1(¢)R(Jsin¢ 
into equation (6.47) withj taken as 1. The equation reduces to

which may be solved as indicated in section 4.3.6. 
(6.48) 
(6.49) 
We now turn to the asymmetric case,j > 1, which is described by equation 
(6.47). For spherical and cylindrical shells, it is possible to arrive at solutions 
for the asymmetric displacements that are analogous to the stress solutions 
given in section 4.3.7.2 and section 4.3.7.4, respectively. 14 For more complicated 
geometries, the transformation applied in section 4.3.7.6 may be of some value; 
however, little work has apparently been done in this area in terms of analytical 
solutions. Rather, for the most part, numerical techniques are used to eva~uate 
displacements for asymmetrically loaded shells of revolution. 15 
Now, we have completed, in some detail, the displacement analysis for shells 
of revolution. Once equation (6.47) is solved for ljIi to determine Di, ~i is 
computed from equation (6.36b) to get D~ and then D~ is found from equation 
(6.34b). 
It does not seem particularly useful to evaluate the membrane displacements 
for specific shell geometries in the same detail that is devoted to stress analysis, 
since the remaining treatment is self-evident on the basis of the analogy estab-
lished. However, it is of general interest to summarize some results of various 
studies that can be consulted by the interested reader. 
First, for closed shells as shown in figure 4-1, certain relationships must exist 
among the displacements at the pole to avoid singularities in the solution. These 
have been derived in Brombolich and Gould 16 and are summarized in table 6-1. 
The derivation of these relationships is discussed further in section 9.3.4.4.

6.3 Membrane Theory Displacements 
253 
Next, since hyperboloidal shells under seismic loading were considered in 
much detail, note that the nondimensionalized displacements for the M distri-
bution are tabulated in Gould and Lee. 1 7 
Last, we should discuss the general influences of the various harmonic com-
ponents of displacementj = O,j = 1, andj > 1 on a rotational shell of the tower 
type. It is convenient to do this with respect to the R-Z Cartesian coordinates 
system shown on figure 2-11. 
For thej = 0 case, the resultant displacement will be principally an elongation 
or shortening ofthe shell in the Z (axial) direction, with any R (radial) deforma-
tion being a uniform expansion or contraction of the parallel circles, labeled 
as DO on figure 6-7(a). 
For the j = 1 case, the resultant displacement will consist of a uniform lateral 
movement in the R direction, illustrated in figure 6-7(b), along with flexural-like 
elongation or shortening across the cross section in the Z direction. The 
maximum lateral displacement Di must be checked to verify the applicability 
of the small deformation theory (assumption [2J, table 1-1). 
As discussed in chapter 4, both the j = 0 and j = 1 cases may be solved from 
the elementary theories of axial deformation and beam bending. Consequently, 
there is no distortion of the cross section. However, for the j > 1 case, the 
displacements will vary around the circumference in proportion to sinj8 and 
cosj8, and the cross section will distort as shown in figure 6-7(c). In problems 
with considerable higher harmonic participation, the limits of the small defor-
mation theory are frequently taxed by the circumferential distortions, where 
the relative displacements represented by the difference in the peak amplitudes 
should be checked. This difference is labeled as 2Di on the figure. Also, signi-
ficant distortions in the higher harmonics would necessarily be accompanied 
by circumferential bending, which would weaken the basis of a membrane 
theory solution. 
For an actual loading that may consist of contributions from more than one 
harmonic, the maximum relative circumferential displacement, after summing 
all participating harmonics, should be used for the check. 
6.3.4 Shells of Translation 
6.3.4.1 Cylindrical Shells. We consider the general strain-displacement rela-
tionship, equations (S.46a-c); and the strain-stress resultant relationships, 
equations (6.33a-c), with the curvilinear coordinates adopted for the cylindrical 
geometry in section 4.4.1. Thus, we take (X = X, fJ = 8; A = 1, B = a; and 
R(7. = 00, RfJ = a to get

A ready example is the simply supported cylindrical shell subject to the first 
harmonic of the Fourier series expansion for the dead load. The stress analysis 
for this loading was carried out in section 4.4.1, and the stress resultants are 
given by equations (4.169). The boundary conditions must be stated with respect 
to the displacements. The longitudinal symmetry dictates that Dx(L/2) = O. 
Since the boundary corresponds to the simply supported condition discussed 
in section 6.2.2, we also have De(O) = O. These boundary conditions yield 
f3(O) = f4(O) = O. 
Proceeding, we find by substituting equations (4.169) into equations (6.51)-
(6.55), and carrying out the integrations and substitutions,

The preceding expressions are useful in the bending analysis of open cylindrical 
shells, when the membrane theory solution serves as the particular solution. The 
boundary displacements, as computed from equations (6.56a-c), are corrected 
by edge forces and moments to satisfy prescribed compatibility conditions on 
the longitudinal boundaries. 18 The procedure is quite analogous to the classical 

256 
6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
flexibility method of structural analysis, discussed in section 6.3.1, and is 
explored in more detail in chapter 9. 
At this point, we consider an example that represents an exception to the 
general association of membrane theory analysis with statically determinate 
systems. Occasionally, boundary conditions are encountered that do not grossly 
violate the requirements discussed in section 4.2, and yet do not permit the 
a priori determination of the stress resultants before considering the displace-
ments. We might call this a statically indeterminate membrane theory problem, 
which was mentioned in section 4.4.1. 
As an illustration, we reconsider the previous example in section 4.4.1 with 
an axial constraint condition 
(6.57a) 
replacing the condition 
(6.57b) 
The preceding static condition enabled!1 (e) and!2(e) in equations (4.168a) and 
(4.168b) to be set equal to zero and, subsequently, the explicit expressions for 
Sand Nx to be written as equations (4.169a) and (4.169b). We may retain the 
other static boundary condition S(L/2) = 0, since the symmetry is not altered; 
thus, !1 (e) is still zero. Proceeding, the expressions for the stress resultants in 
the modified problem are written from equations (4.168) as

We note from equation (6.58b) that the function !2(e) remains to be deter-

equations (6.58a) and (6.58b) into equations (6.51) and (6.52), we have 
1 
Dx = Dxs + Eh !2(e)X + !3(e) 
(6.59a) 
(6.59b) 
where Dxs and Dos represent the corresponding displacements from the simply 
supported cases, equations (6.56a) and (6.56b), respectively. We now have three 
functions of integration to be evaluated from the boundary conditions 
(6.60a)

Do(O) = Do(L) = ° 
and an additional symmetry condition 
257 
(6.60b) 
(6.60c) 
These equations form only three independent conditions because of the symmetry 
of the problem. Since Dos and Dxs automatically satisfy equations (6.60b) and 
(6.60c), we find by evaluating Dx(O), Do(O), and Dx(L/2) that 
Dxs(O, 0) + 13(0) = 0

by equations (6.62a-c). 
To complete the analysis, we substitute equations (6.62a-c) into equations 
(6.58) and (6.59) and take Dxs and Dos from equations (6.56a) and (6.56b). The

6 Constitutive Laws, Boundary Conditions, and Displacements 
We should remember that the applications of this statically indeterminate 
membrane analysis are somewhat restricted, since the admissible boundary 
conditions may not grossly violate the membrane theory requirements as 
discussed previously in section 4.4.1. 
6.3.4.2 Shells with Double Curvature. For doubly curved shells of the form con-
sidered in section 4.4.2, the computation of displacements due to the membrane 
theory stresses is not widely treated in the literature. This is probably due to 
two main reasons: (a) One ofthe principal uses for the membrane displacements 
is to incorporate them into a flexibility type general solution, as described in 
the previous section. Although this approach is quite applicable for shells of 
revolution and for cylindrical shells, it is not particularly suited for doubly 
curved translational shells due to the lack of homogeneous bending solutions. 
(b) The integration of the stress resultant-displacement relations generally must 
be carried out numerically, even for the shell of revolution geometry, although 
the stress resultants may have been evaluated analytically. Rather than deal 
with partially analytical, partially numerical solutions, it is often expedient to 
employ a strictly numerical approach. Such a technique for translational shells 
is described in Hedgren and Billington. 19 Also, the general techniques of finite 
differences20 and finite elements21 have been applied to this class of problem.

CHAPTER 7 
Energy and Approximate Methods 
7.1 General 
In solid mechanics, an energy formulation is often viewed as an alternative to 
the differential equation statement. There exists a direct connection between 
the energy and the differential equation approaches through the principle of 
virtual displacements and through various extremum principles. However, we 
will not pursue this connection, since it is beyond our immediate scope. 
Our interest in introducing energy considerations here is twofold. First, 
energy principles are the basis for many powerful numerical methods for solving 
shell and plate problems. Second, energy-based solutions are an important 
resource even for the classical formulations that we stress in this book. We 
illustrate the latter in some detail in chapter 9, and the materials in this chapter 
may be deferred until the appropriate sections are encountered without loss in 
continuity. 
In this chapter, we highlight some of the more important aspects of energy 
methods. We stress primarily those items essential to support the ensuing appli-
cations. Also, we introduce some approximations that lead to the development 
of numerically based solution techniques. 
7.2 Strain Energy 
The strain energy for an elastic body Ue may be written in terms of the strain 
energy density dUe as 
Ue = Iv dUe 
(7.1) 
where V represents the volume of the continuum. 
In terms of the orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, as defined in chapter 2, 
and the differential thickness d(, as shown on figure 3-1(a), the strain energy 
density follows from the linear theory of elasticity: 
261

7 Energy and Approximate Methods 
dUe = [O"««(OC, p, ()6«(OC, p, 0 + O"pp(OC, p, ()6p(OC, p, () 
+ O"n,,(OC, p, 06n (OC, p, () + O"«p(OC, p, Ow(oc, p, 0 
+ O"«n(OC, Ph'«(oc, P) + O"pn(OC, P)Yp(OC, P)] dV 
(7.2) 
The stress terms are introduced in section 3.1; the strains are defined in section 
5.3. 
For a shell or plate, the differential volume dV may be expressed in terms of 
the differential area dS and thickness d( as 
dV = dSd( 
= A(Odoc B(OdPdC 
= A (1 + ~«) doc B (1 + ~p) dP d( 
or, after dropping terms of o (hjR) : 1, 
dV = ABdocdPd( 
(7.3a) 
(7.3b) 
It is generally preferable to write the strain energy in terms of a single field 
variable, i.e., stress, strain, or displacement. To retain generality, we choose the 
strains, which are connected to each of the others by a single set of equations, 
(6.1) and (5.46), respectively. 
We proceed by noting that ann = 0 (assumption [4J, table 1-1), and by 
rewriting equation (7.1) in the matrix notation introduced in equation (6.2): 
U·=~LLO"J{E}dV 
Now, substituting equation (6.2) into (7.4), we get 
U. = ~ L [[CJ{E} - {O"T}Y{E}dV 
(7.4) 
(7.5) 
Keeping in mind that the elements of {O"T } may be regarded as known, equation 
(7.5) is an expression ofthe strain energy in terms of strain-type quantities alone. 
We may now multiply out the terms in equation (7.5). Since the arithmetic is 
quite lengthy and straightforward, it is omitted here. After integration through 
the thickness and some rearrangement, the resulting expression is

Modified expressions for U. which correspond to other stress-strain laws may 
be written in the same manner using the appropriate [C], as discussed in 
chapter 6.

(7.7) 
It is convenient to interpret equation (7.7) with respect to the three component 
expressions [I, II, III], which are, respectively, linear, quadratic, and cubic in 
the thickness h. First, the linear component Eh/[2(1 -
Jl2)] [I] represents 
extensional and shearing energy, which is predominant in shells that behave 
primarily in accordance with the membrane theory. The quadratic component 
Eh2/[8(1 - Jl2)] [II] is a coupling between extensional and shearing, and twisting 
and bending terms, and enters into some geometrically nonlinear formulations. 
Finally, the cubic component Eh 3/[24(1 - Jl2)] [III] contains both bending 
and twisting energy which are the primary resistance mechanisms in the flexure 
of thin plates. In many cases, only one or two of the three components are 
required. 
7.3 Potential Energy of the Applied Loads 
In equation (3.11e), the surface loading vector q is defined in terms of loading 
intensities per unit area of middle surface q,,(rx, f3), q(J(rx, f3) and qn(rx, f3). Here, 
we may also admit loads which act along a coordinate line. These line loads are 
defined in the same fashion as the surface loading vectors 
(7.8a) 
for a load acting along the s" coordinate line corresponding to f3 = 11, and 
(7.8b) 
for a load acting along the s(J coordinate line corresponding to rx = ex. Boundary 
reactions are frequently represented by such line loads. Furthermore, we may 
accommodate concentrated loads defined by 
(7.9) 
for a load acting at (ex,11). No body forces distributed through the thickness are 

264 
7 Energy and Approximate Methods 
explicitly included in this development. Rather, for a thin continuum, it is 
generally sufficient to refer such forces to the middle surface, as we did in 
chapter 3 for gravity loading. 
Corresponding to each of the loading terms are the components of the middle 
surface displacement vector A(tX,f3). These components have been defined in 
equation (5.3a) as D,AtX, 13), Dp(tX, 13), and Dn(tX, 13). 
It is convenient to define the change in potential energy of the applied loading 
Uq as the product of each loading component and the corresponding displace-
ment component. Further, when a positive displacement occurs, Uq decreases, 
so that the product of the correspondents is given a negative sign. Thus, we have 
Uq = - {Is q(tX, 13)' A(tX, f3)A(tX, f3)B(tX, 13) dtX df3 
+ L [r 4(tX, jJ). A(tX, jJ) A (tX, jJ) dtX

or, in terms of the components, 
Uq = - {Is q;(tX, f3)D;(a, f3)A(tX, f3)B(tX, 13) dtX df3 
+ ~ [1. 1];(tX, jJ)D;(tX, jJ)A(tX, jJ) dtX

+ ~ i'i;(a, jJ)D;(a, jJ)} 
(i = tX, 13, n) 
(7. lOa) 
(7. lOb) 
In equations (7.10a) and (7. lOb), the second term signifies that the load potentials 
for each line load acting on the shell surface are summed, and the third term 
indicates that load potentials for each concentrated load are similarly summed. 
Note that equations (7.8) and (7.9) can be generalized to include distributed, 
line, and concentrated couples corresponding to the rotations Drzp and Dprz. 
7.4 Energy Principles and Rayleigh-Ritz Method 
7.4.1 Principle of Virtual Displacements: Consider an elastic body subject to 
a set of surface tractions composed of the distributed load vectors q(tX,f3), as 
defined in equation (3. 11 e), along with line load vectors 4(tX, jJ) and 4(a, 13) and 
concentrated load vectors q(a, jJ). If we assume that there are no thermal or 

7.4 Energy Principles and Rayleigh-Ritz Method 
265 
inertial effects, then the law of conservation of energy requires that the work 
done by the surface tractions be equal to the strain energy stored in the material. 
Now, a change (5A is imposed on the displacement field A, which moves to 
a new position A + (5A. (5( ) is the variational operator and, for our purposes, 
(5 A may be regarded as a linear increment of the vector A. Also, (5 A is assumed 
to be compatible with the constraints of the system, although this restriction is 
not necessary but only convenient. 1 The source of (5 A is not specified; i.e., it 
does not necessarily result from any particular loading system. Hence, (5A is 
called a virtual displacement. 
Next, we write the energy balance corresponding to the virtual displacement. 
The virtual work performed by the surface tractions is given by 
(5(}q = L 
q(r:x, [3). (5A(r:x, [3)A(r:x, [3)B(r:x, [3) dr:x d[3

~ 
s 
and the strain energy is changed by (5UE' which is written from equation (7.1) as 
(5U, = (5 Iv dUE 
(7.12) 
The r.h.s. of equation (7.12) 
(5 Iv dUE 
may be evaluated from equation (7.5); however, since equation (7.5) is not yet 
written as an explicit function of the displacement A, and since variations 
or increments of A are being considered, we choose to leave the r.h.s. of 
equation (7.12) in the general form. 
Then, the energy balance is written by equating equations (7.11) and (7.12): 
(5(}q = (5 Iv dUE 
(7.13) 
which is a statement of the principle of virtual displacements. This principle 
is a special form of the principle of virtual work, which is regarded by many 
contemporary mechanicians as the cornerstone of solid mechanics. (For a com-
plete discussion of the interrelation of the various energy principles of solid 
mechanics, the interested reader is referred to Washizu. 2 ) 
The principle of virtual displacements, as stated in this section, can be taken 
as an alternate statement of the condition of static equilibrium, as derived in 
chapter 3. This interpretation is used freely in the ensuing sections. 

266 
7 Energy and Approximate Methods 
7.4.2 Principle of Minimum Total Potential Energy: It is convenient to intro-
duce some further assumptions at this point. First, we specify that the volume V 
does not change during the virtual displacement and that the surface tractions 
also do not vary. Next, the variational operator b( ) is restricted to variations 
or increments in displacement only. We now recognize that bUq , as defined in 
equation (7.11), is simply -bUq , where the load potential Uq was defined in 
equation (7.1Oa). Hence, we may rewrite equation (7.13) as 
(7.14) 
where Ut is known as the total potential energy. Bear in mind that Ut itself is 
an integral function of various algebraic functions of the dependent variables, 
as demonstrated by equations (7.6) and (7.10). Such a function is called a 
functional in the terminology of the calculus of variations. Equation (7.14) 
states that the total potential energy of an elastic system in equilibrium must be 
stationary with respect to all displacements satisfying the boundary conditions. 
Technically, the term stationary corresponds to the first variation of the func-
tional U" b U" vanishing, and may indicate an absolute or relative maximum 
or minimum; however, for our applications here, the stationary condition may 
be regarded as an absolute or relative minimum. 
From the standpoint of solution strategy, a dual interpretation of the principle 
is helpful: we seek a displacement field A(Il(, (3) which satisfies the kinematic 
boundary conditions and makes Ut a minimum; then, the stress resultants and 
stress couples computed from A via the strain-displacement and constitutive 
laws will satisfy the equilibrium considerations. 
The classical solution for the problem of finding the minimum of a functional 
is the fundamental problem of the calculus of variations and is not within our 
scope here. The interested reader is referred to Forray3 for an introductory 
treatment of this subject. For our purposes, we wish to pursue the application 
of one of the direct methods of the calculus of variations for the solution of 
equation (7.14). Of the several possibilities available, the Rayleigh-Ritz method 
is perhaps the best known and simplest to understand, and thus we consider 
this technique first. 
However, before proceeding, we might reflect on the first sentence of this 
chapter, where we noted that an energy formulation may be regarded as an 
alternative to a differential equation statement. Historically, the latter was 
called the method of effective causes, whereas the former was known as the 
method of final causes. The renowned mathematician Euler, who was the 
inventor of the calculus of variations, observed in an argument which concisely 
blends science and theology: "Since the fabric of the universe is most perfect, 
and is the work of a most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever takes place in the 
universe in which some relation of maximum and minimum does not appear. 
Wherefore there is absolutely no doubt that every effect in the universe can be 
explained as satisfactorily from final causes, by the aid of the method of maxima 
and minima, as it can from the effective causes themselves .... "4 The resounding 

7.4 Energy Principles and Rayleigh-Ritz Method 
267 
versatility and success ofthe contemporary energy-based finite element method 
appears to leave even Euler's lofty claim understated. 
7.4.3 Rayleigh-Ritz Method: Consider the displacement vector A(ex, /3), which 
was defined originally in equation (5.3a) to include D", Dp, and Dn. Because we 
may have additional generalized displacements, such as D"p and Dp" as defined 
in equations (5.22a) and (5.22b), and because in some cases not all of the 
displacement components are included, we write A in the general form 
(7.15) 
where the index m can be set according to the problem at hand. 
The next step is to assume that each I1k(k = I,m) in equation (7.15) is of the 
form 
(7.16) 
In equation (7.16), each (A represents a linearly independent coordinate function, 
and each Ckl is an undetermined constant coefficient. It is not necessary that 
each coordinate function satisfies all of the kinematic boundary conditions, but 
only that the sequence 11k meets this requirement. The truncation index for 
the sequence n may be set at a different value for 11k , subject to some guide-
lines mentioned further on, and it is anticipated that improved results will be 
obtained by increasing n, which means including more terms in the sequence. 
Commonly, polynomials or elementary trigonometric functions are selected for 
the coordinate functions ¢kl, but a wide variety of possibilities are available 
according to the problem. 
Now, the expressions for 11k are substituted into the strain and the change in 
potential energy terms in equation (7.14). In the strain energy U" as given by 
equation (7.6), we first must evaluate the corresponding strains by using the 
appropriate strain-displacement relationships. After the integrations indicated 
in equation (7.6) and (7.10) are carried out, U, becomes an algebraic rather 
than an integral function. Therefore, the extremum problem of the calculus of 
variations is transformed into the maximum~minimum problem of differential 
calculus. The later problem, in turn, is solved by satisfying 
( k = I,m) 
1= 1,n 
(7.17) 
which produces a set of simultaneous algebraic equations for the coefficients 
Ckl • Following the solution of these equations, the displacement functions 11k 
can readily be used to find strains and curvatures, from which stress resultants 
and couples may be computed. 
The convergence ofthis method in a rigorous mathematical sense is considered 

268 
7 Energy and Approximate Methods 
to be a difficult theoretical question. 5 In practice, improved results are obtained 
in two ways: first, by selecting coordinate functions which closely resemble the 
actual displacement field-the value of physical intuition in this regard is 
obvious; second, by using an increasing number of terms in each sequence. 
Of course, this increases the number of simultaneous equations and the com-
putational effort required. 
The careful reader may have noted that no specific reference was made as to 
the chosen coordinate functions' a priori satisfying the internal compatibility 
or strain-displacement conditions. This illustrates one of the advantages of 
a displacement formulation. For reasonably chosen coordinate functions, the 
ability to compute the strains from the strain-displacement conditions in the 
course of evaluating U. represents, in fact, the satisfaction of the compatibility 
requirements, so that little difficulty is encountered in this regard. 
Another point of general interest is to note the limitations of the method. 
Obviously, the requirement of the displacement function sequences satisfying 
the boundary conditions can be quite restrictive in the case of irregularly shaped 
continua. The application of the Rayleigh-Ritz method in a piecewise fashion 
to subdivisions or finite elements of the entire medium, with the undetermined 
coefficients chosen to enforce continuity requirements along interelement bound-
aries as well as to satisfy the external boundary conditions, has become one of 
the most powerful techniques in applied mechanics: the finite element method. 
A wide variety of applications of this technique are presented by Zienkiewicz,6 
who has contributed greatly to its popularity. 
Even before the emergence of the finite element method in the form pre-
sently familiar to engineers, Timoshenko suggested that the Rayleigh-Ritz 
technique-originated by Nobel laureate Lord Rayleigh in his epic treatise 
"Theory of Sound" and elaborated by W. Ritz, who considered applications 
to the analysis of thin plates-has spurred more research in the strength of 
materials and the theory of elasticity than any other single mathematical tool. 7 
The vast literature accompanying the finite element method resoundingly rein-
forces this claim. 
In regard to the use of the finite element method to model shells, the explicit 
inclusion of rigid body modes has proved to be troublesome as a result of the 
curvilinear coordinates. It has been suggested by Heppler and Hansen8 that 
the more convenient implicit representation is best implemented with approxi-
mations of equal degree for the translational degrees of freedom contained in 
{A}, equation (7.15). This implies a single value of n for all such variables. 
Also, we should mention that the Rayleigh-Ritz method may be generalized 
by taking each of the Ckl coefficients in equation (7.16) as an unknown function 
of one of the independent variables, rather than as simply a constant. In this 
case, equation (7.16) is generalized to 
n 
~k = (Ao(rJ., {3) + L Ck/(rJ. or {3)rPk/(rJ., {3) 
(7.18) 
1=1 

7.5 Galerkin Method 
269 
It is usually convenient to choose rAo to satisfy all of the boundary conditions; 
then, each term of the sequence Ck1tPkl(1 = 1, n) must vanish on the boundaries. 
This extension ofthe basic Rayleigh-Ritz technique is known as the Kantoro-
vich method. If applied skillfully, it can reduce the numerical work considerably 
for some problems. 9 
7.5 Galerkin Method 
The Galerkin method is quite similar in execution to the Rayleigh-Ritz method 
in that the solution is postulated to be represented by a sequence of coordinate 
functions, such as equation (7.16). The most apparent operational difference 
is that in the Galerkin technique, these coordinate functions are tested in the 
governing differential equations rather than in an energy expression. 
As an illustration, assume that the system has been reduced to a single 
equation of the form

where Ak is one element of the general displacement vector {A}, equation (7.15), 
and B is a linear differential operator. For example, the Laplacian operator in 
Cartesian coordinates, obtained by setting 
B( ) = ( ).xx + ( ).yy 
(7.20) 
is frequently encountered in plate problems. The r.h.s. of equation (7.19) repre-
sents known quantities, e.g., the applied surface loading. When equation (7.16) 
is substituted into equation (7.19), we have 
B C~ Ck1tPk) - fk(rx, /3, n) = Rk(rx, /3, n) 
(7.21) 
where Rk is a residual error function. Recall that Ak has been postulated to 
satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem. The essence of the Galerkin 
method is to force Ak to also satisfy the governing equation as closely as 
possible. This means that the residual error Rk should be minimized. 
The condition for minimizing Rk is to require that Rk be orthogonal to each 
<Pkl over the domain of the problem. 9 That is, 
Iv RktPkl dV = 0 
(7.22a) 
or 
(7.22b)

7 Energy and Approximate Methods 
This produces a system of n linear simultaneous algebraic equations in the n 
unknown coefficients Ckl. 
Obviously, this procedure becomes increasingly involved when there are 
multiple equations and unknowns in the system, instead of just a single equation 
in d k as we have considered here. But, for a large class of second order ordinary 
differential equations, the Galerkin method leads to an identical set of coef-
ficients as produced by the Rayleigh-Ritz method10 and may be preferable if 
it is more convenient to work with the governing equations rather than with 
the energy functional. Moreover, there are problems for which no satisfactory 
variational principle has been formulated, but for which a set of governing 
differential equations is available. This suggests that the Galerkin method may 
be even broader in applicability than the Rayleigh-Ritz method.

CHAPTER S 
Bending of Plates 
8.1 Governing Equations 
8.1.1 General Formulation: The equilibrium equations for initially flat plates 
are stated as equations (3.25a-e); the strain-displacement relations are given by 
equations (5.54) or, with transverse shearing strains suppressed, as equations 
(5.55). Taken together with the stress resultant-strain relationships in the form 
of equation (6.10), the requisite boundary conditions discussed in section 6.2, 
and specifically the Kirchhoff conditions equations (6.25) and (6.27), the ele-
ments of a quite general plate theory are available and substantiated. 
It is convenient to consider the development of the theory of plates in several 
stages, initially neglecting transverse shearing strains and in-plane stress resul-
tants and also assuming isotropic material properties. Then, the theory will be 
generalized as necessary. 
When the in-plane forces are neglected, equations (3.25a) and (3.25b) are 
removed, leaving 
[(BQ"),,, + (AQp),p] + qnAB = 0 
(BM"p)." + (AMp),p + B,,,Mp,, - A,pM" - QpAB = 0 
(BM"),,, + (AMp,,),p + A,pM"p - B,,,Mp - Q"AB = 0 
(S.la) 
(S.lb) 
(S.lc) 
Along with the elimination of the in-plane forces, we also disregard D", Dp, 
and the extensional and in-plane shearing strains, e", ep, and OJ. With transverse 
shearing strains also suppressed, the complete set of kinematic equations is 
given by equations (5.55). Of course, there remain extensional and in-plane 
shearing strains away from the middle plane as computed from equations (5,36), 
(5.37), and (5.45): 
e,,(O = (K" 
ep(O = (Kp 
w(O = 2(. 
where K" and Kp are the curvatures and. is the twist of the middle plane. 
On substituting equations (S.2) into equations (5.55a-c), we find

These terms are seen to be functions of the normal displacement Dn only. 
The stress couples are easily expressed in terms of Dn by substituting equa-
tions (S.3a-c) into the appropriate constitutive laws. For isotropic materials,

We will assume that Map = M pa, with the justification following the same 
argument offered in taking Nap = Npa in section 4.1. Note that when the trans-
verse shearing strains are excluded, the transverse shear stress resultants can 
no longer be evaluated from the corresponding constitutive relationship, given 
by the last two rows of matrix 6-2. Rather, equations (S.lb) and (S.lc) are solved 
for

and 
(8.5b) 
so that Q" and Qp can be computed once the stress couples have been deter-
mined. This is analogous to the elementary theory of beams, in which the shear 
force is evaluated from equilibrium considerations rather than from a constitu-
tive law. Only transverse shearing strains can be suppressed; the corresponding 
forces are required for equilibrium. 
The formulation of the plate bending problem is completed as follows: 
1. Introduce equations (8.4) into equations (8.5). 
2. Differentiate equations (8.5a) and (8.5b) by f3 and IX, respectively. 
3. Substitute into equation (8.1a). 
The resulting equation expresses equilibrium in the normal direction in terms 
of the single displacement Dn and constitutes the governing equation of the 
system. This is a classical displacement formulation. Once Dn is evaluated, the 
stress couples may be computed by differentiation from equations (8.5a) and 
(8.5b). 
We also have the effective transverse shears, Q" and Qp,

It is evident from the complexity of the foregoing expressions that the algebra 
involved in carrying out the steps outlined in the previous paragraphs becomes 
quite involved. For our purposes, it is sufficient to specialize the further develop-
ment for two predominant cases: Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates, 
8.1.2 Cartesian Coordinates: For Cartesian coordinates, shown on figure 8-1, 
IX = X, f3 = Y, n = Z, and A = B = 1. Then equations (8.4a-c) become 
Mx = -D(Dz,xx + JlDz,yy) 
My = -D(Dz,yy + JlDz,xx)

8 Bending of Plates 
(8.9b) 
Next, we take a/ay of equation (8.9a) and a/ax of equation (8.9b) and substitute 
into equation (8.1a) to get 
Qx.x + Qy.y + qz = 0 
or 
-D[Dz.xxxx + 2Dz.xxyy + Dz.yyyy] + qz = 0 
Equation (8.11) may be written concisely as 
V2 (V 2Dz) = V4 Dz = qz 
D 
where 
V2( ) = ( ),xx + ( ).yy 
and 
(8.10) 
(8.11) 
(8.12) 
(8.13a) 
(8.13b) 
V2( ) and V4( ) are commonly called the Laplacian and biharmonic operators, 
respectively,l and (8.12) is commonly known as the plate equation. 
The homogeneous part of the governing equation of the engineering theory 
of medium thin plates is the biharmonic equation 
(8.14) 
The recognition of this form is important for at least two reasons. First, there 
is a considerable reservoir of mathematical knowledge dealing with biharmonic 
equations which can be transferred to our plate theory.2 Second, because V4( ) 
is invariant, we may obtain the corresponding equation for any other system 
of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates by simply transforming the biharmonic 
operator. We will verify this for polar coordinates in the next section and utilize 
the invariant property of the V2 and V4 operators repeatedly. 
Of particular interest with respect to the preceding formulation is the reduc-
tion of the system to an equation with a single dependent variable. Stepping 
back through the derivation, we find that the key step was the expression ofthe 
extensional and shearing strains in terms of the normal displacement Dz only, 
equations (8.2) and (8.3). In order to interpret this form a physical standpoint, 
we examine a segment of the middle plane along a normal section traced by 
the X -Z plane as shown in figure 8-2. 
We show the segment deformed in the positive Z direction, where both the 
displacement Dz and the derivative Dz.x are positive. Also, we recall the basic

assumptions listed in table 1-1. We focus on an arbitrary point CD which 
initially lies at a distance , from the undeformed middle plane. Since all 
geometry is referred to the middle plane, we locate the corresponding point on 
the undeformed middle plane, point Q). During deformation, point Q) dis-
places a distance Dz parallel to the original Z direction (assumption III) to point 
0). Since we are neglecting transverse shearing contributions, the deformed 
position of point CD must lie on the normal to the deformed middle plane, Dz,x, 
erected at point 0) (assumption rn). Likewise, the thickness remains constant 
during deformation (assumption @]), so that the point must remain a distance 
(from the deformed middle plane. The final position is denoted by @. 
Note that point CD also has a displacement in the X direction denoted by 
Dx. Since Dx is negative corresponding to the positive sense of Dz,x, as shown 
on figure 8-2, 
Dx = -(Dz,x 
(8.15) 

278 
8 Bending of Plates 
Because the Lame parameters are constant, the strain in the X -direction is 
found from equation (S.S4a), as simply 
ilx(O = Dx,x 
(S.16) 
= -(Dz,xx 
which corresponds to equation (S.2a), after lat, in equation (S.3a) is specialized 
for Cartesian coordinates. 
An identical argument referred to a normal section traced by the YZ plane 
gives 
Dy = -(Dz,y 
(S.17) 
and 
(S.lS) 
corresponding to equation (S.2b), with equation (S.3b) suitably specialized. 
Equations (S.lS) and (S.17) clearly illustrate the coupling of the in-plane dis-
placements to the normal displacement, which is the key to the relatively simple 
form of the plate equation. 
The in-plane shearing strain, adapted from equation (S.S4c), is 
OJ = Dx,y + Dy,x 
(S.19) 
= -2(Dz,xy 
which matches equation (S.2c) with T specialized for Cartesian coordinates. 
To complete the formulation, we also list the effective transverse shears Qx 
and Qy. From equations (S.6), (S.Sc), and (S.9). 
Qx = Qx + Mxy,y 
= -D[Dz,xxx + (2 - J.l)Dz,xyy] 
and 
Qy = Qy + Mxy,x 
= -D[Dz,yyy + (2 - J.l)Dz,xxy] 
The rotations DXY and Dyx are found from equation (S.7) as 
Dxy = r/lx = -Dz,x 
Dyx = r/ly = -Dz,y 
(S.20a) 
(S.20b) 
(S.21a) 
(S.21b) 
It is notable that equation (S.l1) is the two-dimensional counterpart of the 
familiar Bernoulli-Euler equation, which is the cornerstone of beam theory. 
Taking Dz = Dz(X) or Dz(Y) only in equation (S.ll) and neglecting Poisson's 
ratio in the elastic constant D, we have the governing differential equation for 
a beam of unit width and depth h. 

8.1 Governing Equations 
279 
Equation (8.11) also serves to articulate the differences between a plate and 
a two-dimensional gridwork of beams. Whereas the first and third terms, Dz,xxxx 
and Dz, yyyy, clearly describe bending resistance in the respective directions, the 
second term, 2Dz,xxyy, represents the contribution of the twisting rigidity to 
the load resistance. This is easily verified by examining equations (8.8), in which 
the directional derivatives Dz,xx and Dz,yy form the bending stress couples and 
the mixed derivative Dz,xy produces the twisting stress couple. 
The presence of the twisting couples discerns between two-dimensional flexural 
behavior and plate behavior. In this regard, it is of interest to note that in 1789, 
J. Bernoulli proposed approximating a plate with a system of perpendicular 
intersecting beams, based on an earlier model of a flexible membrane by Euler. 
S. Germain, aided by Lagrange, incorporated the twisting term to find the 
homogeneous part of equation (8.11), and the correct strain energy expression 
was derived by Poisson. A comprehensive plate theory, including loading terms 
and boundary conditions, was finally advanced by Navier in 18203, although 
the final resolution of the free edge boundary conditions in terms of effec-
tive forces appeared somewhat later, as discussed in section 6.2.3. We shall 
thoroughly explore Navier's approach later in this chapter. 
8.1.3 Polar Coordinates: For polar coordinates, shown on figure 8-3, oc = R, 
fJ = 0, and n = Z. Obviously, A = 1, but considering the S/J coordinate line, 
(8.22) 
so that B = R. Since B = B(oc) in the general formulation, the B,er term is R,R = 1 
and A,p = o. Also shown in figure 8-3 are the stress resultants and stress couples 
corresponding to the polar coordinates, as adapted from figure 3-2. Equations 
(8.4a-c) become 
M R = -D[Dz'RR+*(~Dz'/J/J+Dz'R)J 
(8.23a) 
M/J = -D[~2 Dz,/J/J + ~DZ'R + jl.DZ,RRJ 
MR/J = M/JR = -D(1 -

Likewise, equations (8.5) specialize to

of the biharmonic operator. That is, equation (8.12) may be directly trans-
formed into any other coordinate system by transforming V4( ) = V2[V2( )] 
accordingly.

A preponderance of circular plate problems encountered in engineering are

from the preceding equations only on planes parallel to the Sa. and sp coordinate 
lines. Frequently, we are interested in values on other planes, since the maxi-
mum transverse shear and/or bending moment may act in directions other than 
those coinciding with the coordinate lines. 
The approach is similar to that used to evaluate principal stresses in linear 
elasticity. In figure 8-4(a), a second set of orthogonal axes (e, 11), which represent 
arbitrary directions for which we wish to evaluate the forces and moments, are

defined. These axes are oriented by the angle y measured clockwise in the 1X-f3 
plane. On the differential rectangular element in the inset, bound by Sa and sp 
coordinate lines, we superimpose the rotated coordinates and consider shaded 
triangle CD, which is enlarged in figure 8-4(b). The positive senses of the stress 
resultants acting on the element are obtained from figure 3-2. 
Summing forces in the Z direction, we have 
-QaAs~sin y -
QpAs~cosy + Q"As~ = 0 
or 
Q" = Qasin y + Qpcosy 
From the shaded triangle ~, we may find 
Q~ = Qa cos y -
Qp sin y 
(8.34) 
(8.35) 
Next, we treat the stress couples acting on the triangular element CD, as 
shown in figure 8-4(c). Again, the positive senses of the couples are set from 
figure 3-2. From moment equilibrium about the ~ axis, we have 
-
M"As~ + Ma sin2 yAs~ + Mp cos2 yAs~ + Mpa cos y sin yAs~ 
+ Map sin y cos yAs~ = 0 
With Mpa = MaP' 
M" = Masin2y + Mpcos2 y + 2Mapsinycosy 
This equation may be written in terms of the double angle 2y as 
M" = -t(Ma + Mp) - t(Ma - Mp) cos 2y + Map sin 2y 
Moment equilibrium about the rJ axis yields 
M,,~As~ - Ma sin y cos yAs~ + Mp cos y sin yAs~ + Map sin2 yAs~ 
-
Mpacos2yAs~ = 0 
from which 
M,,~ = (Ma - Mp)sinycosy - Map(sin2 y - cos2 y) 
or, in terms of the double angle, 
or 
M,,~ = -t(Ma - Mp)sin2y + Mapcos2y 
A similar calculation for triangle ~ gives

(8.39) 
Equations (8.34)-(8.39) enable the transverse shear resultants and the stress 
couples to be calculated on any specified section of the plate. They play the 
same role in the theory of plates as the familiar Mohr's circle transformations 
occupy in the analysis of stresses at a point in the theory of elasticity. 
8.1.5 Alternate Formulation: In the preceding sections, we have almost rou-
tinely referred to the biharmonic equation as the plate equation and, indeed, 
this is common terminology. Nevertheless there are alternative formulations, 
one of which may be anticipated when we reflect on our previously discussed 
analogies to beam theory. Just as in beam theory, we can separate the fourth 
order governing equation, deflection = f(load), into two coupled second order 
equations, deflection = f(bending moment) and bending moment = f(load). The 
latter form is directly applicable to statically determinate beams and is the basis 
for some methods of analyzing statically indeterminate beams as well. 
For the plate problem, we add equations (8.36b) and (8.38b) to get 
M~+ M" = Mil. + Mp 
(8.40) 
Equation (8.40) states that the sum of the flexural stress couples acting about 
two mutually orthogonal axes is invariant with respect to coordinate trans-
formation. Thus, we may proceed using the specialized Cartesian coordinate 
expressions for Mx + My while retaining complete generality. Summing equa-
tions (8.8a) and (8.8b), 
Mx + My = -D(l + /l)(Dz.xx + Dz.yy) 
= -D(l + /l)V 2Dz 
(8.41) 
Equations (8.40) and (8.41) constitute a formal proof of the invariant property 
ofV2. 
We now set 
-
Mx+My

M = 
= -DV Dz 
1+/l 
so that 
V2Dz = -~M

Equations (8.43) and (8.45) comprise the alternate formulation and allow the 
plate problem to be solved in an analogous manner as a uniformly stretched, 
laterally loaded membrane. The membrane problem is regarded as somewhat 
simpler to treat numerically.4 
8.1.6 Boundary Conditions: The boundary conditions corresponding to the 
theory of plates without transverse shearing strains are easily synthesized from 
section 6.2.2 and figure 6-3. Since there are no extensional forces considered, 
three basic conditions apply: fixed or clamped, simply supported, and free. 
These are listed for boundaries IX = ex and f3 = li in table 8-1. They are stated 
in homogeneous form but may be generalized, as described at the conclusion 
of this section. 
With respect to the fixed condition, often called a clamped boundary, note 
from equations (8.7) that DlI.p = 0 and Dpll. = 0 imply Dz,lI. = 0 and Dz,p = 0, 
respectively. 
The simply supported boundary may be written in an alternate form for 
Cartesian coordinates when the boundaries are coincident with the coordinate 
lines. We consider first a boundary defined by X = X, as shown for example 
in figure 8-5. The condition of simple support states that Dz(X, Y) = O. Further, 
it is implied that the boundary is straight, and therefore, Dz, yy(X, Y) = O. A 
similar argument with respect to a boundary Y = Y leads to Dz,xx(X, Y) = O. 
Equations (8.8a) and (8.8b) for simply supported boundaries become 
Mx(X, Y) = -DDz,xx(X, Y) = 0 
(8.46a) 
and 
My(X, Y) = -DDz,yy(X, Y) = 0

which, in view of the preceding discussion, generalize to 
Mx(.X, Y) = -DV2Dz(X, Y) = 0 
and 
My(X, Y) = -DV2Dz (X, Y) = 0 
Thus, on each boundary,

(8.47a) 
(8.47b) 
The statement of the simply supported boundary condition as V2 Dz = 0 is 
predicated on the edge's being straight, as well as undeflecting. In polar coor-
dinates, the second term of equation (8.28a) would not vanish on a simply 
supported boundary, since it is proportional to the rotation DRS' equation 
(8.3Oc), which is unconstrained. Therefore, MR = 0 does not imply V2Dz = O. 
Now consider the free edge condition. In section 6.2.3, we presented the 
contraction of the general boundary conditions into the Kirchhoff conditions 
as a result of the suppression of transverse shearing strains. For the plate 
problem, equations (8.6) indicate that the transverse shear and the twisting 
stress couple are combined into an effective transverse shear force which is 
prescribed to vanish on a free edge. 
In addition to the free edge situation, the effective transverse shear forces 

288 
8 Bending of Plates 
have some interesting implications for edges which are supported. In figure 8-5, 
we show two boundaries of a simply supported rectangular plate, where the 
Kelvin-Tait approach developed on figures 6-4 and 6-5 is used to replace the 
twisting stress couples by closely spaced forces. The positive sense of these 
couples is established from figure 8-1. 
We first study two typical differential segments, say band c, on the X = X 
boundary. At the junction, we have a net contribution to the effective shear 
equal to 
(8.48) 
Again, the positive sense is established from the direction of Qx in figure R-l (cd. 
If Mxy is a continuous function with continuous derivatives, equation (8.48) 
becomes 
Mxy,yL\Y 
(8.49) 
which combines with QxL\Y to give the effective shear Qx, as written in equation 
(8.20a) after the L\ Y terms have been cancelled. On the other hLmd, consider the 
case in which Mxy may be continuous, but not the first derivative in the Y 
direction. This corresponds to a jump discontinuity in M Xy along the boundarv, 
which produces a concentrated force at the point of discontinuity, with the 
magnitude given by equation (8.48). Conversely, if a concentrated force of a 
given magnitude is applied along the boundary, the twisting stress couple must 
undergo a jump equal to the magnitude of the applied force. 
We carry the argument one step further by considering the intersection of 
the two boundaries X = X and Y = Y at the corner. Here, there is definitely a 
jump discontinuity producing a concentrated force of magnitude 
(8.50al 
Since Myx = M xy, we have the corner force 
Reorner = 2M xy 
(8.50b) 
The concept of the corner force is not limited to the intersection of two free 
boundaries, where it obviously must vanish. In general, any right angle corner 
where at least one ofthe intersecting boundaries can develop Mn or MIX will 
have a corner force. Physically, a plate having twisting stress couples acting as 
shown in figure 8-5 would require that the force 2Mxy(.X, Y) be developed at 
the corner to prevent the corner from uplifting. The case of non-right angle 
intersections and the detailed distribution of the effective transverse shear along 
the entire boundary will be examined for some specific examples in the following 
sections. 
It should also be mentioned that the homogeneous boundary conditions 
discussed in this section may be generalized to include prescri bed edge displace-
ments and forces. For example, within the definition of fixed and hinged 
conditions, a nonzero value of the transverse displacement })z may be accom-

8.2 Rectangular Plates

modated. This may be of interest in support settlement problems. Also, a 
specified edge moment may be inserted in place of MIZ or Mp = 0 for the hinged 
and free conditions. Depending on the solution routine, known edge moments 
and edge forces may be grouped with the applied loading terms, but should 
properly be regarded as static boundary conditions. Several illustrations of this 
generalization are found in the ensuing sections. 
Furthermore, a linear combination of a static-kinematic correspondent pair 
may be encountered in the description of an elastic support. For example, 
M,lfi, {3) = kDIZP(fi, {3) would represent a linear rotational spring with spring 
constant k along the boundary ex = "fi.

8.2.1 Bending Under Edge Loading 
8.2.1.1 General Solution. Consider a rectangular plate subject to the uniformly 
distributed edge moments Mx = Ml and My = M 2 , as shown in figure 8-6. The 
sign convention for the moments is consistent with figure 3-2(b). Also, the 
deflected middle plane is shown on the figure. 
For this problem, it is expedient to shortcut the formal procedure of solving 
the governing differential equation, (8.12). Rather, we surmise that the state of 
bending is constant throughout the plate. That is,

Mx(X, Y) = Ml 
My(X, Y) = M2 
Then, we may write from equations (S.Sa) and (S.Sb) 
Mx = Ml = -D(Dz,xx + IlDz,yy) 
My = M2 = -D(Dz,yy + IlDz,xx) 
We eliminate Dz,yy to get 
(Ml -IlM2) 
Dz,xx = -

(S.52b) 
(S.53) 
(S.54) 
(S.55) 
We may proceed further by noting from equations (S.51)-(S.53) that DZ,yy 
must also be constant. Therefore, 
Dz,yy = Xfl(Y),yy + f2(Y),yy = constant 
(S.56) 
Since there is no X in the second term of equation (S.56) to cancel the variable 
X in the first term, fl(Y),yy = 0 and 
fl(Y) = C3 Y + C4 
f2(Y) = Cs y2 + C6 Y + C7 
and 
Dz,yy = 2Cs 
(S.57a) 
(S.57b) 
(S.57c) 
We then substitute equation (S.55) into equation (S.52b), taking into account 
equations (S.53) and (S.57c), to find

291 
Mxy = -D(1 -
/l)C3 
(8.59) 
Upon substituting equation (8.57a) and (8.57b) into equations (8.55), we may 
combine the term XC4 , which arises from Xfl(Y), with the term C1X to produce 
a term CsX, and also absorb the constant C7 into C2 to make C9 . Then, from 
equations (8.55)-(8.59), we have the general solution 
-1 
2 
2 
Dz = 2D(1 _ /l2/(M1 -
/lM2)X + (M2 - /lMd Y ] 
+ C3 XY + CsX + C6 Y + C9 
(8.60) 
At this point, we inquire further into the nature of the constants in equation 
(8.60). Constant C3 multiplies the term XY and thus will contribute to Mxy via 
equation (8.8c). The remaining constants Cs, C6 , and C9 are coefficients oflinear 
or constant terms; therefore, they cannot contribute to the stress couples or to 
the transverse shear stress resultants, which are dependent on quadratic and 
cubic terms, respectively, as is evident from equations (8.8) and (8.9). These are 
rigid-body terms which depend only on the location of the origin and the 
orientation of the coordinate system, but not on the applied loading. 
With the origin of the coordinate system placed in the center of the plate, 
as shown in figure 8-6, double symmetry is created. Therefore, Dz(a, Y) = 
Dz( - a, Y), from which 
C3 = Cs = 0 
Also, Dz(X, b) = Dz(X, - b) so that 
C6 = 0 
Since C3 = 0, equation (8.59) gives 
Mxy = 0 
This leaves only C9 still to be determined. 
(8.61a) 
(8.61 b) 
(8.62) 
Since we have no readily apparent kinematic boundary conditions to con-
strain the displacement, we may arbitrarily select a point on the deflected plate 
as the reference for measuring Dz . It is convenient to choose the origin X = 0, 
Y = 0, as a point of zero displacement, i.e., 
Dz(O,O) = 0 
(8.63) 
meaning that Z is measured from the middle surface of the deflected plate. Once 
again, we stress that this arbitrary choice does not affect the stress resultants 
or couples, since C9 is a rigid-body term. Imposing equation (8.63) on equation 
(8.60) gives C9 = 0 so that, in view of equations (8.61),

Dz(X, Y) = 2D(1 _ /l2) [(Ml - /lM2)X + (M2 - /lMdY ]

Finally, since Dz,xx and Dz, yy are constant, Qx = Qy = ° 
from equation (8,9). 
Likewise, with Mxy = 0, Qx = ° 
and Qy = 0 from equation (8.20), and there are 
no corner forces. 
We have treated the rectangular plate subject to edge moments in detail. It 
is noteworthy that the computational effort was substantially reduced by 
starting with a physically plausible stllte of constant bending in each direction 
and then proceeding to derive a consistent solution for the problem at hand. 
Although this approach may appear to be ad hoc and is obviously not com-
pletely general, it is often productive. It is in the spirit ofthe semi-inverse method, 
attributed to St. Venant, 5 which is so widely applied in the theory of elasticity, 
It is also important to reflect on the role of the preceding solution in the 
engineering application of the theory of plates. First, we will uSe some special 
cases to demonstrate that certain loading combinations are valuable for experi-
mental verification of the theory. Second, we will find that the preponderance 
of readily obtainable analytic solutions are for plates with simply supported 
boundaries. The well-known flexibility method of structural analysis, outlined 
in section 6.3.1, suggests that solutions for plates with fixed boundaries can be 
obtained by combining the corresponding solution for a simply supported 
boundary condition with a solution due to edge moments of appropriate 
magnitude, so as to satisfy the no-rotation condition at the boundaries. 
8.2.1.2 Parabolic Bending. Referring to figure 8-6, we take Ml = M2 = M, 
which represents edge moments of an equal intensity applied uniformly around 
the boundary of the plate. The solution, equation (8.64), reduces to 
M 
2 
2 
Dz(X, Y) = - 2D(1 + p.) (X + Y ) 
(8.65) 
which is the equation of a paraboloid of revolution. We previously encountered 
a surface initially in this form in our study of translational shells, equation 
(4.229). 
8.2.1.3 Cylindrical Bending. Another interesting case is to determine what com-
bination of edge moments would be required to produce a cylindrical deflected 
shape. Since a cylindrical surface is only singly curved, we want Dz = Dz(X) or 
Dz = Dz(Y) only. From equation (8.64), it appears that Ml = jlM2 or M2 = 
jlMl would be required to achieve these conditions. We illustrate Dz = Dz(Y) 
on figure 8-7 and choose M2 = M and Ml = jlM. The deflected shape is given 
by 
M

Dz = --Y 
2D 
(8.66) 
It is instructive to interpret this solution from a physical standpoint. At first 
thought, one might surmise that a plate could be bent into a cylindrical shape

by simply applying equal couples to two parallel edges and leaving the other 
edges unloaded. Closer scrutiny reveals that the Poisson effect under this 
loading would produce a contraction of the top fibers and an extension of the 
bottom fibers, with a corresponding curvature as shown in the cross section on 
figure 8-7. Thus, the moment J.lM is required on the other edges to produce 

294 
8 Bending of Plates 
compensating extension in the top and contraction in the bottom so as to 
restore the rectangular cross section. 
Parenthetically, this simple problem motivates a possible experimental means 
of determining Poisson's ratio, f.l. We consider a plate initially deflected by a 
known couple M 2 acting on the edges parallel to the X axis, and then loaded 
incrementally by a couple Ml along the edges parallel to the Yaxis. Observing 
the deflection in the X direction, the ratio of M Ii M 2 for which a line on the 
surface parallel to the X axis becomes straight would give the effective value of 
f.l. As mentioned in chapter 6, the determination of the appropriate elastic 
constants to insert into a solution is often a difficult proposition. The utilization 
of experiments based on known analytical solutions in which the constants are 
indirectly determined is often productive in this regard. 
8.2.1.4 Anticlastic Bending. The loading case Ml = -M2 = M is shown in 
figure 8-8(a). Substituting into equation (8.64), we have 
-M 
2 
2 
Dz(X, Y) = 
( 
) (X -
Y ) 
2D 1- f.l 
(8.67) 
which we recognize from equation (4.182) as the equation of the hyperbolic 
paraboloid, describing an anticlastic surface. 
We are intrigued by this result because we know that the two sets of real 
characteristics should occur as straight lines on the deflected surface. In our 
study of shells of this shape, we found the families of straight lines quite 
important in the physical understanding of the load resistance mechanism. 
If we restrict our inquiry to square plates, we find from section 4.4.3.1 that 
the straight lines are oriented at 45° to the X - Y coordinates, as shown in figure 
8-8(b). We wish to examine the state of stress along these straight lines, which 
correspond to a rotation of y = + 45° as defined in figure 8-4. We take ~ and ,., 
as X and f, respectively, as shown in figure 8-8(b), and evaluate Mgg, Mgy, and 
Myy from equations (8.36b), (8.37b), and (8.38b). With M" = Mx = M, Mp = 
My = -M, and M"p = Mxy = 0, we find 
Mgg = Myy = 0 
(8.68) 
and 
Mgy=M 
(8.69) 
Constructing the Kelvin-Tate argument, figure 8-8(c), we see that the state of 
stress on the portion of the plate bound by the 45° straight lines which connect 
the midpoints of each side is equivalent to that obtained by taking a square 
plate with sides of length .j2a, loaded only with opposing corner forces of 
magnitude 2M. Naturally, the moments within the perimeter of the straight 
lines on the original plate are identical to those on the corner loaded square 
plate.

The bending of a plate into an anticlastic surface by two pairs of opposed 
corner forces was first investigated by Lamb,6 who is renown for his work in 
hydrodynamics. It is obvious that the situation depicted in figure 8-8(c) is 
relatively simple to simulate physically, and classical experiments based on this 
configuration were performed by Nitdai to verify the flexural theory of plates. 7

(8.70) 
Among his many accomplishments, Navier is credited with developing the 
first satisfactory theory of plates, in the form of equation (8.70). 3 A widely used 
solution technique, which bears his name, is to expand both Dz and qz into 
double Fourier sine series, to solve the resulting equations for a general har-
monic, and to obtain the complete solution by superimposing a sufficient 
number of harmonic components to attain an acceptable precision. We may 
recall that Fourier series were introduced for shells of revolution in section 
4.3.5.2. Here, sine series are chosen because the simply supported boundary 
conditions are satisfied identically, as we will show later.

substitute into equation (8.71) to write the complete solution as 

298 
8 Bending of Plates 
(8.77) 
It remains to be shown that equation (8.77) satisfies the simply supported 
boundary conditions. Referring to section 8.1.6, we require Dz(O, Y) = Dz(a, Y) = 
Dz(X,O) = Dz(X, b) = 0, which are obviously satisfied by equation (8.77); and 
Mx(O, Y) = Mx(a, Y) = My(X, 0) = My(X, b) = O. The latter conditions can be 
written as V2 Dz(O, Y) = V2 Dz(a, Y) = V2 Dz(X, 0) = V2 Dz(X, b) = 0 from equa-
tion (8.47). Obviously, [( ),xx + ( ),yy] operating on equation (8.77) contains 
the product sinjn(X/a) sinkn(Y/b) which vanishes along the boundaries. Thus, 
the identical satisfaction of the simply supported boundary conditions by the 
Navier double sine series solution is verified. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to 
find appropriate functions to satisfy other boundary conditions identically. 
Although we claim to have found the general solution as equation (8.77), the 
analysis is not complete. We must proceed through the tedious differentiations 
required to compute the stress couples and transverse shear resultants. How-
ever, we can regard the operations as being routine, since the displacement 
function is obviously continuous and repeatedly differentiable. This ensures 
that we do not violate the requirements of internal compatibility, which is 
obviously a positive feature of the displacement formulation selected. Also, it is 
noteworthy that here we were able to derive a solution sufficiently general to 
apply for all harmonics; whereas, for example, in the analysis of doubly curved 
shells of revolution, we found it necessary to treat the symmetrical and anti-
symmetrical harmonics separately from the general case. 
Since we have obtained a quite general solution, we will summarize the 
various rotations, stress resultants, and couples. These are obtained from equa-
tions (8.8), (8.9), (8.20), and (8.21), and all have the form 
F(X, Y) = F(Dz ) 
(8.78) 
where the various functions are collected in table 8-2.

From a computational standpoint, it is instructive to examine the conver-
gence of this series. For simplicity, we take a square plate, a = b, and consider 
the deflection in the center, X = Y = a/2.

This indicates quite rapid convergence, so that even the first term of the series 
should be quite close to the actual displacement. However, in this regard, we 
recall that the bending and twisting stress couples are computed from the 
second, and the transverse shear resultants from the third derivatives of Dz. 
From table 8-2, it is obvious that each differentiation adds a j or k to the 
numerator, thereby reducing the convergence rate. Therefore, although the 
displacements may converge quite quickly, many more terms of the series may 
be required to evaluate moments and shears accurately. 
8.2.2.3 Approximate Analysis for Uniformly Distributed Loading. Since the j = 
1, k = 1 term ofthe series gives a very close approximation for the displacement 
due to the uniform load qo, we may study the essential characteristics of the 
transverse shear resultants and the stress couples using a single harmonic 
approximation of a uniformly distributed loading, as shown in figure 8-10. 
From equation (8.80), we compute

Qx(O, Y), Qx(a, Y), Qy(X,O), and Qy(X, b). The positive sense of these forces is 
found by referring to figure 8-l. 
We now consider equilibrium in the Z direction and define the total applied 
load 
QZl = f: f: qzdY dX 
With the load intensity given by 
qz(X, Y) = (16/n2 )qo sin n(X/a) sin n(Y/b) 
as specified by equations (8.73) and (8.83), 
which acts in the positive Z direction.

the resultant QZ2 acting in the positive Z direction given by

MUltiplying the numerator and denominator of equation (8.86c) by (a2 + b2 )2 
and adding it to equation (8.88), we have 
(8.89) 
as an apparently unbalanced force. But, we must also include the comer forces. 
From equation (8.50b) and figure 8-5, we see that there are comer forces of 
magnitude 2Mxy as shown on figure 8-10. Referring to table 8-2 and equation 
(8.83), we find 
Mxy(X, Y) 
(8.90) 

8.2 Rectangular Plates 
303 
In evaluating Rxy at each comer, we note from figure 8-5 that a positive Mxy 
produces a comer force in the negative Z direction. At each comer, (X = 0, a; 
Y = 0, b) Mxy is negative, so that the comer forces are directed in the positive 
Z direction. Each force is given by 
producing a total force in the positive Z direction of 
QZ3 = -4Rxy

QZl + QZ2 + QZ3 = 0 
(8.91) 
(8.92) 
(8.93) 
Thus, we demonstrate the contribution of the comer forces to the overall 
equilibrium of a rectangular plate. As an order of magnitude estimate, each 
comer force will be about 10% of the total load for a square plate. 
It may be shown that for non-right angle comers of simply supported 
polygonal plates, there is no concentrated comer force, but, as the included 
angle approaches 90°, the intensities of the effective transverse shears on the 
boundaries, Q~ and Q", increase rapidly near the comer. This may be demon-
strated for a triangular plate which is discussed in section 8.4.2. 
We now consider the stress couples, which are easily computed using table 
8-2 and equation (8.83):

It is obvious that both functions will follow the load distribution shown in figure 
8-10 with maxima at the center, X = a12, Y = b12. 
In order to assess the relative magnitude ofthe bending moments at the center 
of a square plate where b = a, we evaluate

By comparing equations (8.95) and (8.96e), it is apparent that the plate is a far 
more efficient flexural member than the equivalent beam due to the two-way 
flexural action and the twisting rigidity. Equation (8.95), which gives the maxi-
mum bending moment for a uniformly loaded square plate, also confirms the 
observations of the seventeenth-century French physicist Mariotte, who sur-
mised that the total load Qo corresponding to the maximum moment, in this 
case Qo = qoa2, should remain constant and independent of the size ofthe plate 
if the thickness is not changed. 8 
It is of interest to compute the moments in the vicinity of the corners by 
considering rotated axes ~, Yf at 45° to the X - Y coordinates, as shown on 
figure 8-9. Referring to figure 8-4(c) and taking 0( = X, fJ = Y, and y = 45° in 
equations (8.36b), (8.38b), and (8.37b), respectively, give 
R

M,,~ = M~" = 0 
Thus, in the vicinity of the corner, we find a state of anticlastic bending, as 
described in section 8.2.1.4. The moments ±Mxy or ±R/2 are the same order 
of magnitude as the moments in the center of the plate, e.g., O.68Mmax for a 
square plate.9 Mq is essentially a clamping moment, similar to that developed 
at a fixed boundary. 
Another manifestation of the corner force phenomenon may be observed by 
visualizing a rectangular plate under self-weight set on a continuous knife edge. 
Seemingly, this boundary would correspond to an ideal simple support condi-
tion. However, for an applied loading in the downward (negative Z) direction, 
the preceding solution would indicate corner forces acting downward on the 
plate. If the plate simply rests on the knife edge with no tied owns, the corners 
will tend to rise away from the support. It may also be remarked that the lack 
of restraint to develop the corner forces will remove the clamping effect of Mq 
and thereby cause the maximum moments at the center to increase,9 perhaps 
by 35% for a square plate. 
8.2.2.4 Rectangular Patch Loading. In figure 8-11, we show a loading uniformly 
distributed over a rectangular patch on the plate. The total magnitude of the

As a check, we select the uniformly distributed load considered in section 8.2.2.2. 
For that case, we have Qo = qoab; c = a, d = b; and ~ = a12, '1 = b12. Substi-
tuting these values into equation (8.98), we get the identical result to that 
obtained in equations (8.80). The solution for the deflection function and the 
subsequent stress resultants and couples follow from table 8-2. 
8.2.2.5 Concentrated Loading. The solution just obtained for the patch loading 
may be used to describe a concentrated load at any point on the plate. To 
illustrate, we consider Qo acting at X = ~ and Y = '1, as shown on figure 8-12.

We introduce the notation Dz(X, Y;~, rJ) to emphasize that Dz is dependent on 
two sets of coordinates: (a) the point of observation of the deflection, (X, Y), and 
(b) the point of application of the applied load Qo, (~, rJ). The coefficient of Qo 
in equation (8.101) is defined as the Green's function, G(X, Y;~, rJ), and repre-
sents the displacement at the point of observation (X, Y) due to a unit load at 
the point of application (~, 1]). Graphically, the Green's function for the displace-
ment of the plate may be visualized as an irifluence surface representing the 
deflected shape of the entire plate due to a unit load at a particular point. 
Once we establish the Green's function for a system, we may readily deter-
mine the deflection at any point of observation due to a prescribed surface 
loading qz = qz(~, rJ)· Then, by superposition, we have 
Dz(X, Y) = II qz(~,rJ)G(X, Y;~,rJ)d~drJ 
(8.102) 
Area 
The Green's function approach is widely used in mechanics. 10 

308 
8 Bending of Plates 
If we consider the solution given by equation (8.101) in more detail, we expect 
the series for Dz to converge rapidly because of the rand e terms in the 
denominator. However, the series expressing the stress couples and transverse 
shear resultants are found to be divergent right at the point of application of 
the concentrated load, e.g., X = ~, Y = f/. Of course, the series for the load itself 
will not converge. Thus, this solution, although simple in form, is of limited 
value for numerical computations and the approach described in the following 
section is more useful. However, it is of interest to compute Dz for a square 
plate, b = a, with a concentrated load Qo at the center. The first four terms of 
the series for this case give

8.2.3 Levy-Nadai Solution for Rectangular Plates 
8.2.3.1 General Technique. Although the double sine series solution developed 
in the previous section is straightforward, the resulting expressions often require 
that many terms be included in the summation to attain acceptable precision. 
Of course, this objection is largely anachronistic in the era of the computer; 
nevertheless, it is of interest from a fundamental standpoint to explore the 
possibility of generating more efficient solutions. Also, the Navier solution is 
well suited for the simply supported boundary only, and the desire to treat other 
boundary conditions gave rise to the work of Levy, a pupil of St. Venant, and 
Estanave. 6 The ensuing single series approach was exploited by NtLdai as well, 
and carries the name of the Levy-NtLdai solution. 
We introduce this technique by taking the displacement function Dz as the 
sum of (a) DZ1 ' a beam solution which satisfies equilibrium and the boundary 
conditions in one direction; and, (b) DZ2 ' a homogeneous solution which can 
be used to enforce the boundary conditions in the other direction, while not 
violating the boundary conditions in the first direction. 
We refer to figure 8-13 where the X axis is located along the center line of 
the plate, for reasons which will become obvious. We select DZl = DZl (X) as 
the beam bending solution for a loading qz which satisfies the boundary 
conditions at X = 0 and X = a. For example, a simply supported beam under 
a uniform load qz = qo has a deflection function

A number of similar formulae for various loadings and boundary conditions 
are collected in the AISC Manual of Steel Construction.ll 
If we make the adjustment for the Poisson effect and change the term El to 
D, equation (8.105) will satisfy the plate equation, equation (8.12), as well as the 
simply supported boundary conditions at X = 0 and X = a. However, the 
boundary conditions at Y ± b/2 are obviously not addressed since DZI = 
DZI (X) only. To correct this, we need D Z2 , which satisfies the boundary condi-
tions in both directions. Since DZI already will balance the loading, DZ2 should 
be a homogeneous solution of equation (8.12). 
8.2.3.2 Simply Supported Plate Under Uniform Load. We consider the case of 
a uniformly loaded, simply supported plate, previously treated in section 8.2.2.2. 
Using equation (8.105) for DZ1 ' with El replaced by D, we require the functions 
to satisfy 
V4 D z = V4 DZI + V4 DZ2 = ~ + 0 = ~ 
(8.106) 
For DZ2 ' we choose a single series solution

The selection of the origin at the middle of the side parallel to the Y axis now 
becomes useful. Since the loading is uniform, we recognize that the plate 
deflection is symmetrical about the X axis. This being the case, only even 
functions of Y[f( - Y) = f(Y)]' can participate in the solution and the coeffi-
cients of the odd terms in equation (8.110), [f( - Y) = - f(Y)], drop out. 
Therefore, we have q and ci = 0 and the complete solution to equation (8.106)

The rotations, stress couples, and transverse shear stress resultants can be 
obtained directly from equations (8.20), (8.8), and (8.9). 
In retrospect, it is apparent that the "beam" solution could have been taken 
in the form of a series initially. This would lead directly to equation (8.114) 
without encountering equation (8.111). 
A detailed study of this solution, including the convergence properties, is 
contained in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger.9 We have already exam-
ined this problem in detail in section 8.2.2.2, and the results found there can 
be confirmed with the single series solution. Also available are parametric tables 
for the various functions for uniform and hydrostatic loading.9 Additionally, 
single series solutions are developed for some additional cases including the 
bending moments under a concentrated load,12 a somewhat difficult com-
putational exercise as noted in section 8.2.2.5. 
Some results of the comprehensive study in Reference 12 are of general 
interest. The single series Levy-Nadai solution is usually more rapidly con-
verging than the double series Navier solution. Heuristically, this indicates that 
starting with the known beam function as a first approximation leads efficiency

Fig.8-14 Rectangular Plate Loaded by Edge Moments 
in the computational algorithm. Particularly, since smaller computers are 
becoming increasingly popular in engineering, the savings achieved by using a 
solution based on a well-founded initial trial may be significant. 
An interesting observation is that when the aspect ratio b/a ~ 3, a plate 
behaves essentially as a one-way flexural member spanning in the short direc-
tion, except near the edges. This may be appreciated by noting the denomina-
tors of equations (S.115a) and (8.115b), which get large with increasing b/a. With 
the influence of DZ2 diminishing, the deflection function is dominated by the 
beam solution DZ1 ' 
S.2.3.3 Other Single-Series Solutions. Another classical application of the 
U:vy-Nadai approach is shown in figure 8-14, where a rectangular plate is 
loaded by constant edge moments. If Mn(X) =F M Y2(X), the solution is facili-
tated by the superposition of a symmetrical and an antisymmetrical case. The 
details are left as an exercise. 
Also, we observe that rectangular plates which have only two opposite sides 
simply supported may be treated by inserting a beam solution with the appro-
priate boundary conditions for DZl in equation (S.111) and proceeding ac-
cordingly. This will be adequate for plates which have two sides simply sup-
ported, two sides clamped; three sides simply supported, one side free; and two 
sides simply supported, one side clamped, one side free. 
More complicated boundary conditions are treated with Levy-Nadai type 
solutions in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger. 13•14 Also, some additional

solution procedures are discussed in Kiattikomol, Keer and Dundurs, 15 and ex-
tensive tabulated results are provided by Szilard. 16 These analytical approaches 
become rather involved, and one must soon turn to numerical techniques. The 
classical solutions remain valuable, however, as a basis for incisively evaluating 
the results of numerical solutions through quantitative comparisons and order-
of-magnitude bounds. 
8.3 Circular Plates 
8.3.1 Axisymmetric Bending 
8.3.1.1 Governing Equation. Axisymmetric bending of circular plates is de-
scribed by equations (8.33). Using equation (8.27) and (8.28b) with the () terms

and, finally,

(8.117) 
where C1 and C2 have again been redefined. The terms composing equation 
(8.117) are known as biharmonic functions, because they individually and collec-
tively satisfy the biharmonic equation in polar coordinates. 
It is informative to compute the rotation, stress couples, and transverse shear 
corresponding to DZh ' These are found from equations (8.30c), (8.31), and (8.32b) 
and are listed in table 8-3. We note the following characteristics of the tabulated 
functions: 
1. R21n R is singular at R = 0 and R = 00, and is the only term which contri-
butes to QR' 
2. R 2 is singular at R = 00; for this function M R = Mo (homogeneou.s bending). 
3. In R is singular at R = O. 
4. 1 is regular throughout. 
These characteristics are useful for expediting solutions to various problems, 
as we will see later.

Of course, we may write equation (8.118b) as a function of Dz, but, as we shall 
see, this is unnecessary. There are two additional boundary conditions required, 
since we have a fourth order system. These conditions follow from the require-
ment that the solution remains finite at R = O. This is a familiar situation, which 
we first encountered in the treatment of domes in chapter 4. In our preceding 
characterization of the various biharmonic terms, we noted the singularity of 
the In Rand R 2 1n R terms at R = 0, so that we must set C1 = C3 = O. Then, 
we find, by substituting the remaining terms in equation (8.117) into equations 
(8.118) with the help of table 8-3, that

which indicates that the bending moment is constant throughout the plate in 
all directions. A state of homogeneous bending was previously encountered for 
a rectangular plate in section S.2.1.2. 
The first logical case of applied surface loading is a uniform load qz = qQ, as 
shown on figure S-16. It is easily verified by direct substitution into equation 
(8.116) that the particular solution is 
Dzp(R) = 6~~ R4 
(S.123) 
For convenience, the various functions corresponding to this particular solu-
tion are recorded in table S-3. 
Now, combining equation (S.117) with equation (S.123) after setting C1 = 
C3 = 0 as previously discussed, we have

while at the center, R = 0, 
(8.131) 
so that the maximum moment occurs at the center of the plate. At the pole, 
MR(O) = M6(0), which again illustrates the isotropy condition first encountered 
in the study ofaxisymmetrica1ly loaded shells of revolution, section 4.3.2.1. 
We now investigate a clamped plate under uniform load, as shown in figure 
8-17. There are two evident procedures: (a) We may superimpose the solutions 
for the cases shown in figures 8-16 and 8-15 and enforce the compatibility 
condition DR6(a) = 0 to compute MR(a); or, (b) we may take the solution as 
equation (8.124), with the constants determined from the boundary conditions 
(8.132) 
We select (a), the superposition approach, and enter table 8-3 with constants

We may consisely plot the stress couples for both the simply supported and the 
clamped boundary conditions on a common graph, figure 8-18, since the edge 
moment MR(a) produces a constant value of MR and M8 throughout. 
8.3.1.4 Plates with Annular Openings. Another case of interest is a circular plate 
with an annular opening, as illustrated in figure 8-19. We first consider the plate 
under an exterior edge moment Ml and an interior edge moment M 2 , both 
uniformly distributed around the circumference. Only the exterior boundary is 
constrained against displacement in the Z direction. We have the homogeneous 
solution, equation (8.117), subject to the boundary conditions

A check of table 8-3 reveals that only the C1 term contributes to QR(R). From 
equation (8.136c), QR(b) = 0 so that C1 = O. The remaining conditions, equa-
tions (8.136a), (8.136b), and (8.136d), lead to the complete solution17

The maximum value of Mo is at R = b,

Fig. 8-21 
Arbitrary Plate with Circular Hole 
(8.140) 
Now, if we let the hole shrink, e.g., b -+ 0, then Mo(b) -+ 2M, indicating that there 
will be a stress concentration around the hole approaching twice the value of 
the moment applied on the outer edge. 
This deduction may be generalized a bit more. If we consider a plate of 
arbitrary shape which has a state of homogeneous bending M and a circular 
hole of radius d, as shown in figure 8-21, the solution in polar coordinates should 
contain the same biharmonic terms as equation (8.138), 
(8.141) 
The influence of the In R term on the moments diminishes rapidly away from 
the hole, whereas the R2 term produces homogeneous bending. If we use the 
boundary conditions 
MR(d) = 0 
MR(R -+ (0) = M 
we find from table 8-3 that

which is the solution for a solid plate under a concentrated load P at the center. 
It is of interest to review the order of the limiting operations which were 
employed in the preceding paragraphs. In going from equation (8.149) to 
equation (8.152), the effect of the hole was eliminated because we treated the 
general function Dz(R) rather than a specific value. On the other hand, the 
limiting operation based on equation (8.140) retained the effect ofthe hole, since 
it was performed on a specific value Me(b) rather than the general function, 
Me (R). 
There are a number of additional cases that can be handled with the solutions 
developed here. For example, a plate with a rigid annular insert or plug is shown 
in figure 8-23. If the plug is subjected to an arbitrary axisymmetric loading, 
qz(R), the total load on the plug is 
P = 2n f: qz(R)R dR 
(8.153) 
We may then represent the region of the plate R ~ b by the superposition of

(a) a solution corresponding to figure 8-22 with QR = - P /(2nb) and (D) a 
solution based on figure 8-19 with MI = 0 and M2 = MR(b), as shown in 
figure 8-23. Then, MR(b) is evaluated from the compatibility condition, 
DRO(b) = O. There are numerous variations of the rigid insert problem which 
are important in machine design. A compilation ofthese solutions may be found 
in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Kriegerl7 and in Szilard. 18 
In figure 8-24, we show a plate with an annular opening which is axisym-
metrically loaded outside the opening. It is convenient to first solve the case of 
the same loading applied to a solid plate, figure 8-24(b). In this first solution, 
we may take qz(R) in the region 0 ::::;; R ::::;; b as any function of R. For con-
venience, we show qz(R) = qz(b) for 0::::;; R ::::;; b on figure 8-24(b). For the solid 
plate, we evaluate QR(b) and MR(b). For example, with a uniform load qz(R) = 
qo, we would have 
nb2

QR = - qo 2nb = -Q0"2 
(8.154) 
and also calculate MR(b) from equation (8.129a) as 
MR(b) = (~~)<3 + ll)(a 2 -

(8.155)

would be determined by combining the homogeneous solution, equation (8.117), 
with an appropriate particular solution. Once QR(b) and MR(b) are evaluated 
for the solid plate, we correspondingly apply a force and a moment of equal 
magnitude and opposite sense to the open plate, as shown in figures 8-24(c) 
and (d). These latter solutions correspond to the cases shown in figures 8-22 
and 8-20, respectively, and the complete solution for b ::; R ::; a is found by 
superposition. 
It should be noted that the preceding solutions can also represent a clamped 
plate, with the addition of a solution for MR(a) = M 1 , as shown in figure 
8-19. The value of Ml would be determined from the compatibility condition, 
DRIJ(a) = O. 
8.3.2 General Bending 
8.3.2.1 Solution of Governing Equation. We return to the general biharmonic 
equation, equation (8.26), and seek a set of biharmonic functions which satisfy 
the 0 dependence as well. The solution to the homogeneous equation may be 
written in the separated from attributed to the noted mechanician Clebsch 19

DZh = FO(R) + L Fi(R) cosjO

(8.156)

8 Bending of Plates 
This approach is identical to that employed for the shell of revolution in section 
4.3.5.2. From a physical standpoint, this is plausible since the circular plate is 
the degenerate case of the shell of revolution as Rtf> -+ 00. 
The function FO(R) is the solution of the axisymmetric case as given by 
equation (8.117). For j ~ 1, we substitute equation (8.156) into equation (8.26) 
to get 
Just as in the case of shells of revolution, the solution for j = 1 is somewhat 
simpler and is given by 
Fl(R) = c}RlnR + qR 3 + qR + cl ~ 
(8.158) 
Forj> 1, 
Fi(R) = C1Ri + C~R-i + qRi+2 + CiR-(j-2) 
(8.159) 
These homogeneous solutions may be combined with appropriate particular 
solutions to solve specific loading cases, with the integration constants being 
determined from the boundary conditions. In each case, the loading function 
and hence the particular solution should be described in a Fourier cosine series 
to conform to DZh' as given by equation (8.156). 
8.3.2.2 Linearly Varying Load. We investigate a circular plate under a linearly 
varying load, as shown in Figure 8-25. This can represent hydrostatic pressure 
and may be resolved into symmetric and antisymmetric components, as shown 
on the figure. We write the symmetric component as 
° 
ql + q2 
qz=---
2 
the antisymmetric component as 
and the displacement function as 
Dz = D~ + Di 
(8.160) 
(8.161) 
(8.162) 
For the symmetric component, q~, we have already obtained solutions for 
simply supported and clamped boundaries in section 8..3.1.3. To apply the

clamped boundary. 
For the antisymmetric component, q}, we write

Since the governing equation, equation (8.26), requires four derivatives with 
respect to R, we select a fifth order function for the particular solution

A detailed solution for the antisymmetric loading condition with a simply 
supported boundary is presented in Timoshenko and W oinowsky-Krieger, 19 
where the stress couples, the transverse shear forces, and the locations and 
magnitudes of the maximum moments are established. Also, the problem of a 
clamped circular plate under an eccentric concentrated load and some rather 
extensive generalizations thereof are examined in Timoshenko and W oinowsky-
Krieger19 and in Michell.20 Among other things, the latter solutions provide an 
illustration of the Maxwell-Betti reciprocal theorem for a plate.21 
8.4 Plates of Other Shapes 
8.4.1 General Approach: There are a number of solutions for plates with other 
than rectangular or circular planform which can be expressed in Cartesian or 
polar coordinates. In Cartesian coordinates, solutions for triangular and ellipti-
cal plates are found by starting with a deflection function Dz that is proportional 
to the equation of the boundary of the plate, which ensures that Dz = 0 on the 
boundary. The function may be augmented in order to satisfy either a simply 
supported or a clamped condition. In polar coordinates, a sector shape can 
readily be treated using the general solution described in section 8.3.2.1. Some 
representative illustrations are presented in the following sections. Also, a vari-
ety of tabulated results for various shaped plates are contained in Szilard. 16. 18 
8.4.2 Triangular Plates: Considering the equilateral triangular plate shown in 
figure 8-26, the coordinate system is located with the origin at the centroid of 
the triangle. With respect to this coordinate system, the equation of each side 
is shown on the figure and the product of the three terms on the l.h.s., 
DZ1 = _![X3 -
3Xy2 - a(X2 + y2) + ~a3J 
(8.176)

27 
gives us a start toward a deflection function, since it will satisfy the condition 
Dz = 0 on all boundaries. The function DZl must be modified to satisfy the 
equilibrium condition V4Dz = 0 and the remaining boundary conditions. 
For an edge moment M uniformly distributed around the boundary, the 
complete solution is

To verify this solution we must show that (a) V 4Dz = 0 on the entire plate; (b) 
Dz = 0 on the boundaries; (c) Mx( -a/3, Y) = M·(the other boundaries may 
also be checked but this will not be necessary because of the symmetry). 
Proceeding, we consider 
1. V 4 Dz = 0 throughout: From equations (8.13) we note that any nonzero term 
remaining after the application of V2( ) must be at least quadratic in X and 
y. No such terms are present in equation (8.177). 
2. Dz = 0 on boundary: This is obviously satisfied from the derivation of DZl • 
3. Mx( -a/3, Y) = M: From equation (8.8a) 
Mx = -D(Dz,xx + J1.Dz,yy)

A complete stress analysis may be performed in the format of section 8.2.2.3 
and is available in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger.23 
8.4.4 Circular Sector Plates: A plate which is a slice of a complete circle may 
be solved using a procedure similar to that described in section 8.3.2.1, except 
that the displacement function for the harmonics j ;;::: 1 is taken as a Fourier 
sine series. The arithmetic is rather involved, and the interested reader is referred 
to Szilard.24 
The relatively meager array of available solutions for irregularly shaped 
plates points to the tremendous breakthrough made possible when the finite 
element technique became available. This method enables almost any form to 
be realistically modeled and solved. 
8.5 Energy Method Solutions 
8.5.1 Strain Energy for Plates in Flexure: Refer to the general expression for 
U. as given by equation (7.6). We are presently considering no extensional 
strains, and, in accordance with our previous development, we choose to neglect 
transverse shearing strains. Therefore, we have only the component III in 
equation (7.7) remaining along with the bending thermal term. 
U. = ~ Is {[(K" + Kp)2 - 2(1 - Il)(K"Kp - ,2)J

Since we are interested in a displacement formulation, we may substitute the 
strain-displacement relationships, as given by equations (5.55), into equation 
(8.181). This will be specialized for the two coordinate systems that we have 
considered, Cartesian and polar. 
For Cartesian coordinates, we take ex = X, {3 = Y, n = Z, and A = B = 1 in 
equation (5.55) to get 
KX = -Dz.xx

Ky = -Dz,YY

(8. 182c)

Then, substituting equations (8.l82a-c) into equation (8.181), we have

(8.183) 
(8.184) 
Since the strain energy density dV" which is the integrand of equation (8.184), 
is obviously independent of the choice of coordinate axes and since V2 Dz has 
been shown to be invariant, the term 
(8.185) 
also must be invariant. This observation can be useful for transforming V. to 
other coordinate systems. 
For polar coordinates, we may repeat the preceding calculations with IX = R, 
P = 0, n = Z, A = 1, and B = R. However, for variety, we will use the invariant 
property of dV. as discussed in the preceding paragraph, since V 2Dz is already 
available in polar coordinates and is given by equation (8.28a) or (8.28b). The 
thermal term will be omitted since it is proportional to V 2Dz . Therefore, we 
need only transform the term stated in equation (8.185).

Equations (8.186a-c), (8.187), and (8.188) constitute the basic relations required 
to transform equation (8.185) into polar coordinates. 
We now evaluate the required derivatives using the chain rule:

We may then substitute equations (8.189)-(8.191) into equation (8.184) to get 
the strain energy in polar coordinates. This is rather involved in the general 
case, but we can write the axisymmetric expression fairly concisely. We first 
evaluate equation (8.185), dropping the O-dependent term. This reduces to 
Dz,xxDz,rY - (DZ,Xy)2 = (l/R)Dz,RDz,RR' which, along with the first two terms

8.S.2 Simply Supported Plate Under Concentrated Load: We reconsider the 
problem illustrated in figure 8-12 and attempt to confirm the solution using the 
virtual work approach derived in section 7.4.1. Our first step is to take the

However, because of the orthogonality relationships, only those terms corre-

omitting the terms which subsequently drop out, we have

the entire expression for Ue2 vanishes and Ve = Vel, with no thermal effects. 
We are now prepared to impart a virtual displacement to the system. Re-
calling the derivation in section 7.4.1, the virtual displacement is required to 
conform to the constraints of the system, which means in this case the boundary 
conditions. If the virtual displacement is twice differentiable, the strain-
displacement conditions, equations (5.55a-c), will automatically satisfy com-
patibility. Therefore, it is logical to take the virtual displacement in the form of 
equation (8.194). 
We proceed for a single general term of the series and choose for the virtual 
displacement 
(8.199) 
where bD~k represents the amplitude of the virtual displacement. Also, note that 
the source of the virtual displacement need not be specified. 
Referring to figure 8-12, the virtual work done by the external load Qo acting 
at X = ~ and Y = 11 is 
MJq = QobDz(~,l1) = QobD~kSinjn~Sinkn~ 
The corresponding change in strain energy is

8.5.3 Clamped Plate Under Uniformly Distributed Loading 
8.5.3.1 Approximate Solutions. The solution of a fully clamped plate cannot be 
readily accomplished with the Navier-type double series solution and the 
solution of the Levy-Nadai procedure is fairly involved.25 This seems to be an 
ideal case for the application of the Rayleigh-Ritz or Galerkin method. Since 
the first steps in either method are common, we will proceed with a unified 
solution as far as possible. We consider the problem shown in figure 8-28, with 
a uniformly distributed qo acting in the positive Z direction. Referring to section 
7.4.3, we have here only one generalized displacement Dz so that in equations 
(7.15) and (7.16), m = 1 and Lll = Dz. We select a single coordinate function 
rPz = rPl = (X2 - a2)2(y2 -
b2)2 
(8.206) 
and the one-term approximation for Dz is 
(8.207) 
It is obvious that the coordinate function rPl satisfies the stated boundary 
conditions: Dz(±a, Y) = Dz,x(±a, Y) = Dz(X, ±b) = Dz,y(X, ±b) = O. How-
ever, it is sometimes difticult to select appropriate coordinate functions when

more complicated boundary conditions are encountered. The coordinate func-
tion selected here is obviously twice differentiable, so that the compatibility 
relationships will also be satisfied. 
For both the Rayleigh-Ritz and the Galerkin solutions, the Laplacian, V 2Dz, 
is required. We compute 
Dz,xx = 4c(3X2 - a2)(y2 - b2)2 
Dz,yy = 4C(X2 - a2)2(3y2 - b2) 
Dz,xy = 16cXY(X2 - a2)(y2 - b2) 
and write 
V 2Dz = Dz,xx + Dz,yy 
= 4c[(3X2 - a2)(y2 _ b2)2 + (X2 _ a2)2(3y2 _ b2)]

8.5.3.2 Rayleigh-Ritz Solution. We proceed first with the Rayleigh-Ritz solu-
tion. Regarding the second term in equation (8.184) as given by equation (8.185), 
it has been found to be negligible for plates in which the plan-form is polygonal 
and the edges remain straight26 and, in fact, was shown to vanish entirely for

given by 
Uq = - f~a f~b qoDz dY dX 
(8.211) 
where Dz is given by equation (8.207). 
We then write the total potential energy as 
Now invoking equation (7.17), we set 
U,.c = 0 
(8.212) 
(8.213) 
We may simplify the arithmetic by commuting the operations in equation 
(8.213) and equation (8.212): 
U,.c = :e f~a f~b [~ (V2Dz)2 - qoDz JdY dX

Then, substituting this expression into equation (8.214) and solving for e, we

c ~ ;;. {S.20 [1 + ~):J + 2.97 (~)' } 
(8.217) 
Then Dz(X, Y) is found by substituting c into equation (8.207). 
In comparison to more accurate solutions, the results for the central deflec-
tion are found to vary from an error of about 5% for a square plate, alb = 1, 
to over 30% for alb = 0, representing a long, narrow plate.26 With such discre-
pancies on the displacements, the stress couples can be expected to be further 
in error and intolerable, since these quantities are obtained from twice dif-
ferentiating the deflection function. In general, when appraising numerical 
solutions, one should compare the most sensitive meaningful quantities, which 
are generally those computed by differentiation. 
Increased accuracy may be obtained for this problem by adding coordinate 
functions. A three-term approximation is 
(8.218) 
Only even terms are included because of the double symmetry of the problem. 
8.5.3.3 Galerkin Solution. The one-term Galerkin solution follows from equa-
tions (7.19)-(7.22). We first compute the residual error term Rk , defined by 
equation (7.21), by substituting equation (8.206) into equation (8.12). Con-
tinuing from equations (8.208a-c), we find 
and 
Dz,xxxx = 24c(y2 - b2)2

In order to show that the one-term Rayleigh-Ritz and Galerkin solutions are 
identical, we must prove II = III, where II is defined in equation (8.216). We 
rewrite both II and III in terms of the coordinate function rPz. In view of 
equations (8.208a) and (8.208b), 
II = f~a f~b (rPz,xx + rPz, yy)2 dY dX 
= f~a f~b [(rPZ,XX)2 + 2rPz,xxrPz,yy + (rPZ,yy)2] dX dY 
(8.224) 
Also, by comparison with equations (8.219), 
III = f~a f~b (rPz,xxxx + 2rPz,xxyy + rPz,yyyy)rPz dY dX 
(8.225) 
We now integrate equation (8.224) by parts. For the first term, we have

(8.226) 
(8.227) 
If the boundary terms at X = ± a drop out, we have reduced the first term of 
equation (8.224) to that of (8.225). Considering the physical boundary condi-
tions discussed in section 8.1.6, we see that 
a 
rPz,xxrPz,x I = 0

342 
8 Bending of Plates 
implies that either the moment or rotation is zero on the boundary. Similarly, 
for 
a 
rPZ,xxxrPz I = 0 
-a 
either the transverse shear or the deflection must vanish. For the clamped plate, 
the rotation and deflection are zero on X = ± a so that the boundary terms 
drop out and the first terms of II and III are identical. Similar integrations by 
parts reduce the second and third terms of II to the corresponding terms of III, 
so that the one-term Rayleigh-Ritz and Galerkin solutions are identical. 
8.6 Extensions of the Theory of Plates 
8.6.1 Variable Flexural Rigidity: Consider a simple extension of plate theory, 
where the flexural rigidity D, as defined by equation (S.4d), is generalized to 
D(rx, f3). Then, the plate equation may be reformulated by taking D = D(rx, f3) in 
equations (S.4a-c) and following the subsequent steps outlined in section S.1.1. 
To illustrate for Cartesian coordinates, equations (S.Sa-c) are written as 
Mx = -D(X, Y)(Dz,xx + jJ.Dz,yy) 
My = -D(X, Y)(Dz,yy + jJ.Dz,xx) 
Mxy = Myx = -D(X, Y)(1 -
jJ.)Dz,XY 
and equations (S.9a) and (S.9b) generalize to 
Qy = -[D(X, Y)(Dz,yy + jJ.Dz,xx)]'y 
+ (1 -
jJ.) [D(X, Y)Dz,xy Ix 
Qx = -[D(X, Y)(Dz,xx + jJ.Dz,yy)],x 
+ (1 -
jJ.)[D(X, Y)Dz,xrJ,y 
whereupon the equilibrium equation (S.l1) becomes 
(S.22Sa) 
(8.22Sb) 
(S.22Sc) 
(S.229a) 
(8.229b) 
[D(X, Y)(Dz,xx + jJ.Dz,yy)],xx + 2(1 -
jJ.)[D(X, Y)Dz,xyIxy 
(S.230) 
+ [D(X, Y)(Dz,yy + jJ.Dz,xx)]'yy = qz 
Equation (S.230) is used to analyze rectangular plates of variable thickness 
using the Levy approach in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger27 and in 
Conway.28 
Axisymmetrical circular plates with an axisymmetric thickness variation are 
of importance in machine part design. The appropriate governing equation is 
derived in an analogous manner as for the rectangular plate,29,3o and possible 
solution schemes and examples are provided in those references. 
In practical applications, solutions for plates of variable thickness are often 
conducted using finite difference or finite element procedures. 

8.6 Extensions of the Theory of Plates 
343 
8.6.2 Specifically Orthotropic Plates: Another direct extension of the theory of 
plates is the accommodation of specifically orthotropic properties, as defined in 
section 6.1.2. In this case, the material properties are given by [Cor]' equation 
(6.11), and specifically by the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows and columns of [D or], 
matrix 6-3. In Cartesian coordinates, the generalized moment-curvature expres-
sions are found from equation (6.10) by replacing rows and columns 4 through 
6 in matrix 6-2 with the corresponding elements of [Dor]; by taking X, Y, Z for 
0(, {3, and n; and then by using equations (8.3) for the curvatures Kx , K y, and -r: 
Mx = -(Dor44Dz,xx + Dor45DZ,YY) 
My = -(Dor55Dz,yy + Dor54Dz,xx) 
Mxy = Myx = -Dor66DZ,XY 
(8.231a) 
(8.231b) 
(8.231c) 
The elements of [Dor]' DOrij' are presumed to be known, as discussed in section 
6.1.2, and Dor45 = Dor54' 
If we take each Dorij as constant, we may write the equilibrium equation by 
first substituting equation (8.231) into equation (8.9a) and (8.9b) to get 
Qy = -(Dor55DZ,yyy + Dor45DZ,Xxy + Dor66DZ,xxy) 
Qx = -(Dor44Dz,xxx + Dor45DZ,XYy + Dor66DZ,XYY) 
(8.232a) 
(8.232b) 
and then introducing equations (8.232a) and (8.232b) into equation (8.10), which 
becomes 
+ qz = 0 
(8.233) 
To verify the consistency of this derivation, we may check the isotropic case, 
From matrix 6-2, Dor44 = Dor55 = D, Dor45 = JlD, and Dor66 = D(1 -
Jl). There-
fore, Dor45 + Dor66 = D and equation (8.233) reduces to equation (8.11). 
Equation (8.233) is of interest in the study of stiffened plates. In this applica-
tion, the term Dor45 may be neglected, as discussed in section 6.1.3, and the terms 
Dor44 , Dor55, and Dor66 are taken as the corresponding elements of [Deq], 
equation (6.23). Other methods of finding the material constants for specific 
configurations are discussed in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger. 31 
For a rectangular plate simply supported on all sides, equation (8.233) may 
be solved using the Navier approach, following section 8.2.2. Starting with 
equation (8.71) for Dz, the l.h.s. of equation (8.233) becomes

(8.236) 
Thus, available solutions for simply supported isotropic plates are easily ex-
tended to include orthotropic plates, once the material properties are defined. 
8.6.3 Multilayered Plates: Another form of anisotropy which is of considerable 
practical importance is the multilayered plate, which may be composed of two 
or more bonded layers of isotropic or anisotropic materials. The simplest 
method of dealing with plates composed of isotropic layers is to use a modified 
form of the basic plate equation, equation (8.12): 
V 4 Dz = qz 
Dr 
(8.237) 
'where Dr is a transformed flexural rigidity which is computed from the basic 
properties, E and fl, of the individuallayers.32•33 
One type of layered plate is called a sandwich plate and is composed of at 
least three plies. The outer layers, or skin, are usually relatively thin, but of high 
strength, and resist the flexural and twisting moments by dev~loping couples of 
opposing in-plane forces; the inner core transmits the shear stresses between 
the outer layers. This behavior is similar to that of an H-shaped beam, where 
the two outer layers would represent the flanges and the inner fayer, the web. 
The analysis of this type of plate may be based on a large deflection theory 
developed by E. Reissner. 34 
8.6.4 Inclusion of Transverse Shearing Deformations: Preceding the develop-
ment ofthe Kirchhoff boundary conditions, section 6.2.3, we saw that the order 
of governing equations derived by neglecting transverse shearing deformations 
permits only two of the three obvious force conditions to be enforced at a free 
edge. Also, the presence of concentrated corner forces in rectangular plates is 
attributable to the suppression of the transverse shearing deformations. For 
thin plates, these shortcomings appear to be largely academic and the elemen-
tary plate theory is adequate; however, as a plate becomes relatively thicker, 
transverse shearing effects may be more important. Moreover, eliminating the 
transverse shearing strain permits the in-plane displacements to be written 

8.6 Extensions of the Theory of Plates 
345 
directly in terms of the normal displacement [see equations (8.15) and (8.17)] 
and leads to much simplified governing equations. 
Although the contradictions incorporated in elementary plate theory have 
been evident since the time of Kirchhoff, a satisfactory alternative which in-
cludes transverse shearing deformations appeared relatively recently (1944) and 
is attributed to E. Reissner, 35,36 with some significant embellishments by A. 
Green.37 More recently, refined plate theories have been classified into first 
and higher order shearing deformation theories,38 which carry the respective 
names of Hencky-Mindlin and Kromm-Reddy. The distinction is drawn 
because the first order theory (commonly known as Mindlin plate theory) does 
not satisfy the shear stress-free conditions on the surfaces ± hj2. This is easily 
seen by referring to the last two equations of matrix 6-1, where the shear stresses 
are proportional to the shearing strains which are constant through the thick-
ness and, hence, do not necessarily vanish at the surfaces. The higher order 
theories attempt to correct this shortcoming by including thickness-dependent 
factors, at the expense of adding unknowns into the equations. As discussed in 
section 6.1.1.2, the deficiency is minor in the context of elementary plate and 
shell theory. It has also been observed that the effect of shearing deformations 
is more pronounced in orthotropic than in isotropic plates.38 The interested 
reader is referred to Timoshenko and Woinowski-Kreiger39 and to Reddy38 
for some examples of solutions including transverse shearing deformations. 
Although the inclusion of transverse shearing deformations complicates the 
problem considerably for a differential equation formulation, the incorporation 
of these effects is relatively easy in an energy-based approach. If we consider 
equations (7.6) and (7.7), we see that the linear component Ehj[2(1 - Jl2)] [I] 
contains the transverse shearing strains. Thus, we may add 
Eh r 2 
2 
4(1 + Jl) Js (Ya + Yp)ABdad/3 
(8.238) 
to equation (8.181) to get the expanded version of UB: 
(8.239) 
When we proceed with the displacement formulation, we substitute the 
general strain-displacement relationship equations (5.54a-h) into equation 
(8.239). For Cartesian coordinates, we have 
KX = Dxy,x 
Ky = Dyx,y 
r = t(Dyx,x + Dxy,y) 
(8.240a) 
(8.240b) 
(8.240c) 

346 
Yx = Dz,x + Dxy 
yy = Dz,y + Dyx 
and equation (8.239) becomes

(8.241) 
A similar specialization is easily accomplished for polar coordinates. This is 
left as an exercise. 
In anticipation of the use of equation (8.241) in a Rayleigh-Ritz type of 
solution, it is instructive to compare this generalized form with the version 
where transverse shearing strains are neglected, equation (8.183). Referring to 
the procedure described in section 7.4.3, we see that the index m in equations 
(7.15) and (7.16) will be equal to 3 instead of 1, corresponding to the generalized 
displacements 
(8.242) 
This means that there will be three times as many coordinate functions and 
considerably more numerical calculations, but this is not foreboding in the 
computer age. 
There is another, more subtle, difference between the energy expressions 
which can be important from a computational standpoint. In equation (8.241), 
the generalized displacements are present only up to the first derivative, whereas 
in the earlier form, equation (8.183), there are second derivatives of the depen-
dent variables. The order of the highest derivative appearing in the strain energy 
functional dictates the minimum continuity required at junctions of finite 
elements.4o The lower order continuity necessary for a functional based on 
equation (8.241) rather than equation (8.183) somewhat compensates for the 
increased number of generalized displacements and makes the formulation 
including transverse shearing deformations attractive. The relative ease and' 
efficiency of including these deformations in an energy-based formulation for 
shells of revolution are demonstrated in Brombolich and Gould.41 The neces-
sity for employing precautions to avoid overstiffening by "shear locking" was 
noted in section 5.3.2. 
8.6.5 Folded Plates: Plates are basically shallow flexural members and are 
somewhat inefficient in flexural action. An appealing procedure to increase the 

8.6 Extensions of the Theory of Plates 
347 
Fig. 8-29 
Folded Plate 
flexural rigidity of a given plate is to introduce undulations or folds in one, or 
possibly more than one, direction. This serves to increase the section modulus 
in these directions markedly. Of course, because there is no longer a flat surface, 
this procedure is impractical for many situations. 
A widely used application of this concept is the folded plate, which is pri-
marily used for roofs over large, column-free areas. One such structure, partially 
designed by the author, is shown in figure 2-8(x). 
A typical configuration for a folded plate roof is shown in figure 8-29. 
Basically, this structure is a relatively wide beam with a saw-tooth cross section 
of depth H spanning the distance L from support to support. The idealized 
beam behavior is violated by distortions of the cross section, which make 
elementary beam theory, alone, inapplicable. 
The load-carrying mechanism for folded plates may be conveniently visual-
ized in two parts. The surface loading is resolved into in-plane and transverse 
components. Then, the transverse surface loads are resisted by one-way plate 
bending over a span D. The reactions produced by the transverse loads on the 
plates are applied at the ridge lines, which act as supports for the plates. Near 
the ends, some of the loading is directly transferred to the end supports, but 
since H « L, the plates are basically one-way and most of the load is carried 
to the ridge lines. This is called plate action. 
The ridge lines are subjected to the plate reactions, which are resolved in 
oblique coordinates to act in the planes of the intersecting plates at each joint. 
Along with the in-plane component of the surface load on each plate, these 

348 
8 Bending of Plates 
forces are resisted by the flexural action of the plate acting as a beam of width 
h, and depth D and span L. This is termed diaphragm action. 
The end blocks are generally solid infills or stiff frames, rigid in the vertical 
plane but flexible in the longitudinal direction, and a supporting structure, such 
as a wall or a line of columns. Away from the ends, the ridge lines deflect in 
accordance with the diaphragm action of the plates acting as beams with span 
L, width h, and depth D. Thus, an interaction occurs between the plate and the 
diaphragm behavior along the ridge lines, since the supports for the plate action 
are not unyielding but elastic. This conceptual model is the basis for many of 
the folded plate theories used in engineering design. Because these design 
methods are generally developed in term~ of planar structural analysis theory 
rather than in terms of the theory of plates, they are not treated here. The 
interested reader is referred to Yitzhaki42 and to Simpson.43 
The governing equations for folded plates may be written in the context of 
the theory of plates by combining the equations describing the in-plane forces 
and corresponding displacements with the basic plate equation, equation (8.12). 
To do this, we take local Cartesian coordinates such that X and Yare in the 
plane of each plate and write equations (3.25a) and (3.25b) as 
Nx,x + Nxy,y + qx = 0 
Nxy,x + Ny,y + qy = 0 
(8.243a) 
(8.243b) 
Next, we replace the stress resultants by the strains using matrix 6-2, without 
thermal effects.

Equations (8.245a) and (S.245b) together with equation (8.12), 
(8.246) 
form the governing equations for the so-called exact theory of folded plates.44 
Solutions using this theory are presented by several authors,45-48 and a critical 
evaluation of various solution procedures is available.49 

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation 
8.7.1 Modification of Equilibrium Equations: We now direct our interest to the 
analysis of plates which are subjected to forces acting in the middle plane, along 
with the transverse loading. If these middle plane forces are compressive in at 
least one direction, plate instability is a possibility. Further, if there are no 
transverse forces but only in-plane compressive forces acting, we have the 
two-dimensional analogue of the classical Euler column buckling problem. In 
order to show this, we must relax our basic assumption 11], which enabled the 
equilibrium equations to be formulated with respect to the undeformed middle 
surface, and now include the effect of the in-plane forces on the equilibrium in 
the normal direction. 
Refer to figure 3-2(a) and consider a section of the middle surface along an 
Sa coordinate line with length dsa. We show two such sections on figure 8-30, 
both before and after deformation. Figure 8-30(a) is for Na and Figure 8-30(b) 
pertains to Npa. The surface rotation Dap is denoted in accordance with figure 
5-2 and may be expressed in terms of Dn•a by equation (8.7a) if transverse 
shearing strains are neglected. Note that figure 8-30 corresponds to the positive 
sense of Dap and the negative sense of Dn.a, since the ( + )ta direction is opposite 
to that shown on figure 5-2(a). 
We now reexamine the stress resultant vectors Fa and Fp, as defined in 
equations (3.11a) and (3.11b). First, from figure 8-30(a), we see that the stress 
resultant Na has a normal component - Na sin Dap ~ - NaDap which adds a 
force - NaDaptn dsp to Fa in equation (3.11a). The negative sign is in accordance 
with the sign convention defined on figure 3-2(a). Next, from figure 8-30(b), we 
have the stress resultant Npa with a normal component - NpaDaP which contri-
butes a force - NpaDaptn dSa to Fp in equation (3.11b). Similar sections along an 
sp coordinate line show the forces - Nap Dpatn dsp adding to Fa in equation (3.11a) 
and - NpDpatn dSa going to Fp in equation (3.11b). Since these additional normal 
forces associate only with Qa and Qp, respectively, as coefficients oftn in the two 
equations, they are easily traced through to equations (3.25a-c), the scalar force 
equilibrium equations for a plate. The in-plane equations are unaffected, and 
the generalization of equation (3.25c) is 
[B(Qa -
NaDap -
NapDp.)J.a + [A(Qp -
NpaDap -
NpDpa)J.p 
+ qnAB = 0 
(8.247) 
It is convenient first to expand equation (8.247) and then eliminate certain 
terms by introducing the in-plane equilibrium equations, (3.25a) and (3.25b). 
We will proceed for the two coordinate systems which are of interest in the 
theory of plates, Cartesian and polar. 
For Cartesian coordinates, 0( = X, P = Y, n = Z, and A = B = 1. Then, 
equations (3.25a) and (3.25b) become 
(8.248a)

(8.249)

Substituting equations (8.248a) and (8.248b) into equation (8.249) and setting

Nxy = N yX' we have 
Qx,x + Qy,y - NxDxy,x - NyDyx,y - Nxy(Dyx,x + Dxy,y) 
+ Dxyqx + Dyxqy + qz = 0 
(8.250) 
A more familar form of equation (8.250), applicable for transverse loading 
only, is found by letting qx = qy = 0 and also by suppressing transverse shearing 
strains, allowing 
(8.251) 
to be introduced from equations (8.7). Then, substituting equations (8.10)-(8.12) 
into equation (8.250), we have 
(8.252) 
which becomes the governing equation for the deflection of a plate in the 
presence of lateral forces. 
In polar coordinates, oc = R, f3 = 8, and n = Z along with A = 1 and B = R. 
Equations (3.25a) and (3.25b) become 
(RNR),R + NOR,o -
No + qRR = 0 
(RNRO),R + No,o + NOR + qoR = 0 
and equation (8.247) expands to

Substituting equations (8.253a) and (8.253b) into equation (8.254) and taking

NRDz,RR - RDz,R = qz 
(8.257) 
where V:( ) = the axisymmetric biharmonic operator defined in equations 
(8.33) or, more conveniently, in equation (8.116). Thus, we establish equations 
(8.252), (8.256), and (8.257) as the expanded forms of equations (8.12), (8.27), and 
(8.33b), respectively, when basic assumption rn is relaxed. 
An example using a modified form of equation (8.257) is solved by Timoshenko 
and Woinowsky-Krieger.5o Some classical problems in Cartesian coordinates 
are treated in the subsequent sections. Also, more complex cases including shear 
loading, orthotropic plates, sandwich plates, and clamped boundaries are in-
vestigated by Brush and Almroth.51 
8.7.2 Modification of Strain Energy: The expression for strain energy, as given 
by equations (7.6) and (7.7), must be supplemented when coupling of the nor-
mal displacements and the in-plane strains is included, since nonlinear strain 
terms are required. We refer to the basic description of deformation as dis-
cussed in sections 5.2 and 5.3. However, we will not attempt to develop a 
complete nonlinear theory, but only to retain those higher order terms con-
taining Dn. This corresponds to a modified finite deformation theory, in which 
the in-plane displacements remain small but the rotations are regarded as 
moderate. 
First consider equations (5.13) and (5.14) for A' and B'. Noting from equations 
(5.10c) and (5.12c), respectively, that "'" and "'p contain Dn terms, we have 
[ 
1 
J1/2 
A' = A (1 + e,,)2 + A2 (Dn,,,)2 
and 
Using the binomial theorem, we may simplify these expressions to 
A' = A[1 + e" + 2~2(Dn,,,)2J 
and 
B' = B [1 + ep + 2~2 (Dn.p)2 J 
(8.258) 
(8.259) 
(8.260) 
(8.261) 
We now return to the definition of the middle surface strains in section 5.3.1. 
We denote the modified strains as e", ep, and ro, respectively, and retain the basic 
definitions of these components of strain. Then, equation (5.25) becomes 

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation 
353 
(8.262) 
in view of equation (8.260). Correspondingly, equation (8.261) generalizes to 
_ 
1 (Dn•p)2 
6p = 6p +"2 13 
(8.263) 
For the shearing strain, we note the product 1jI"ljIp in equation (5.27), which 
previously had been neglected. Referring to equations (5.lOc) and (5.12c) and 
retaining only the Dn terms, 
Therefore, from equation (5.27), we find 
(8.264) 
In order to obtain a modified expression for the strain energy, refer to the 
basic expression, equation (7.4). Assume that the strain energy due to bending 
is not changed by the axial forces and remains the cubic component of equation 
(7.7), (D/2) [III]. Also assume that the in-plane stress resultants are due entirely 
to applied edge loading in the plane of the plate, in which case they are 
unchanged during bending. This implies that the external and internal work 
done by these constant stress resultants acting through the corresponding 
external and internal in-plane displacements will cancel in the energy balance 
when a virtual transverse displacement is introduced. This may be formally 
substantiated by rather involved arguments,50 which are not repeated here. 
Therefore, the additional strain energy V., is due entirely to the straining of the 
middle surface as a result of the bending. With these assumptions, we can write 
V. = Is [N"(B,, -
6,,) + Np(Bp -
6p) + N"p(ro - w)]ABdexdf3 
(8.265) 
Note that there is no 1/2 coefficient in equation (8.265), since the in-plane stress 
resultants are already acting when the additional middle surface strains occur. 
Substituting equations (8.262)-(8.264) into equation (8.265) gives 
V. = ~ Is [N,,(D~"r + Np(Di p r 
+ 2N"p (D~,,) (DiP)] AB dex df3 
(8.266) 
and the total strain energy for plate bending in the presence of constant in-plane 
forces is

U. + U. = U.+S = 2[III] + U. 
(8.267)

U. = 2" Js [Nx(Dz,x) + Ny(Dz,y) + 2NxyDz,xDz,y] dX dY

(8.270) 
and U. is given by equation (8.193). 
8.7.3 Simply Supported Rectangular Plate Under Transverse and Unidirectional 
In-Plane Loadings: Consider the rectangular plate shown in figure 8-9 with the 
addition of constant in-plane loads Nx(O, Y) and Nx(a, Y) along the two bound-
aries parallel to the Y axis, as shown on the inset in figure 8-31. 
We choose the differential equation approach from section 8.7.1, whereby 
equation (8.252) becomes 
DV4 Dz - NxDz,xx - qz = 0 
(8.271) 
Following the procedure used in section 8.2.2.1 with Dz given by equation (8.71) 
and qz by equation (8.73), we arrive at the equation for specific harmonics j 
andk 
(8.272) 
from which the Fourier coefficient is 
(8.273) 
As before, the Fourier coefficient for the applied surface loading, qik, is evaluated 
from equation (8.75). The total plate deflection is then computed from equation 
(8.71). 
If the in-plane load is tensile, Dik, and hence the deflection, is reduced from 
the case with no in-plane forces; however, if Nx is compressive, the deflection

is increased. In fact, there are critical values of Nx, one for each of the specific 
harmonicsj = J and k = k, for which the denominator of { } in equation (8.273) 
vanishes and the deflection becomes infinite: 
NYcr = -n2D(f)T(fY + (~Yr 
(8.274) 
The N XCT are the elastic buckling loads for a uniaxially compressed, simple 
supported rectangular plate and are unaffected by the transverse load qz. 
It is evident from equation (8.274) that Nxcr is quite similar in form to the 
Euler buckling formula for columns. It includes the term n 2 , the term D = 
Eh3/[12(1 -
J.l2)], which is equivalent to the EI term in the column formula, 
and the length terms a and b. However, the length terms are not only in the 
denominator; rather, the dimension in the direction of loading, a, appears also 
in the numerator. 1\lso note that the J term, corresponding to the harmonic 
numbers of the buckling modes in the direction of loading, occurs in both the 
numerator and denominator. The value of J which yields the lowest critical load 
is not obvious from equation (8.274). It is quite clear, however, that k = 1 will 

356

give the lowest value of NXer> so that we may write 
NXer! = -n2D(7Y[(~r + Grr

which may be conveniently rearranged as

(8.276) 
where alb is the aspect ratio. 
Now, the problem is to determine which value of] will produce the lowest 
Ncr for a given aspect ratio. This may be done by plotting the term []~+T ~ r 
against the aspect ratio alb for various integer values of J, as shown in figure 
8-31. It may be observed from this figure that the minimum value

Of course, the number of waves in the buckled shape will still depend on alb. 
The deflected shape for] = 2, corresponding to .j2 ::s; alb ::s; J6, is shown on 
the inset. 
In contrast to column buckling, note that the lowest critical load is practically 
independent of the length ofthe member in the direction of the loading. Rather, 
only the length of the loaded edge, which is a quantity not present in the column 
problem, is significant. 
It should be noted that the single series Levy-Nadai approach, introduced 
in section 8.2.3, is effective for plate instability investigations as well. The latter 
is the logical alternative to the Navier solution when boundary conditions 
other than all sides simply supported are encountered. The single series solution 
is applied in Brush and Almroth,51 and an application is suggested in the 
exercises. 
8.7.4 Simply Supported Rectangular Plate Under Transverse and Bidirectional 
In-Plane Loadings: Now consider the rectangular plate with a concentrated 
load Qo(~, 11), as shown in figure 8-12, with the addition of constant in-plane 
loadings Ny(X,O) and Ny(X, b) along the boundaries parallel to the X axis, as 
well as the Nx loads introduced in the preceding section. Nxy is taken as zero. 
We use the virtual work method developed in section 8.5.2, with Dz given by 
equation (8.194) and V. by equation (8.197). The first step is to evaluate V., as

given by equation (8.196). Following the procedure detailed in section 8.5.2, the 
additional strain energy due to the in-plane forces is

Vii = -8- jf; k~l (D~kf Nx

(8.280) 
Adding equation (8.280) to equation (8.197) gives the total strain energy U'+ii. 
Next, we take for U. H the single general term of the series, vl!ii> and find 
JV.+ii. From equation (8.280), we have 
(8.281) 
and adding equation (8.281) to equation (8.203), we get 
(8.282) 
The principle of virtual work is applied by equating equations (8.200) and 
(8.282), from which we find 
Then, the total deflection may be evaluated by equation (8.205). 
We see that if Nx and Ny are both tensile, the deflection is reduced from the 
case where no in-plane forces are acting. If Nx and/or Ny are compressive, we 
may have instability indicated by the denominator -+ 0, whereupon 
(8.284) 
Equation (8.284) can lead to several classes of buckling problems, such as (a) 
Nx and Ny are proportional, i.e., Nx = INcr and Ny = gN"" where I and g are 
specified constants which permit Ncr to be evaluated; and, (b) Nx (or Ny) is a 
fixed value. Correspondingly, Nycr (or Nxcr) can be computed. As an example, 

358 
8 Bending of Plates 
when Ny = 0 we have an identical situation to that discussed in the previous 
section and covered by equation (8.274). Note also that buckling may occur 
even if one of the in-plane forces is tensile, although it retards the instability. 
As a simple example of buckling under bidirectional in-plane loading, con-
sider a square plate with a = band Nx = Ny. Equation (8.284) reduces to 
_ 
n 2D _ 
_ 
Ncr = -V(j2 + k2) 
(8.285) 
Obviously the lowest critical load is found for J = k = 1 as

Ncr = -~ 
(8.286) 
This indicates aO single wave in each direction. 
Another simple illustration for the square plate is provided by taking Ny = 
gNx . Then, we have

The effect of unidirectional tension on the retardation of buckling is demon-
strated by considering a negative value of 9 in equation (8.287). In many 
practical cases of unidirectional compression, the boundaries in the other 
direction, parallel to the direction ofloading, are restrained in the middle plane. 
As the plate then deflects, these boundaries develop tensile forces in the middle 
plane which oppose the onset of instability. 
8.7.5 Finite Deformation of Plates: If we consider the modified expressions for 
the middle surface strains, equations (8.262)-(8.264), and restrict ourselves for 
the moment to Cartesian coordinates, we have 
(8.289) 
in view of equations (5.54a-c). Equations (8.289) may be combined into a single 
compatibility equation in terms of Dz and the strains. 
We form certain second partials, assuming sufficient continuity so that the 
order of differentiaton can be altered: 

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation 
BX,yy = Dx,xyy + (DZ,xy)2 + Dz,xDz,XYy 
By,xx = Dy,xxy + (Dz,xy)2 + Dz,yDz,xxy 
ro,XY = Dy,xxy + Dx,xyy + (Dz,xy)2 + Dz,xxDz,yy 
+ Dz,xDz,XYY + Dz,yDz,xxy 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
359 
(8.290) 
Adding equations (8.290a) and (8.290b) and subtracting (8.290c), we obtain 
(8.291) 
We next eliminate the strains in favor of the stress resultants. From matrix 
6-2, in the absence of thermal terms,

By = Eh (Ny -

(8.293)

OJ =

(c) 
Now, replacing Bx, By, and OJ by Bx , By and ro in equation (8.293a-c) and 
introducing this equation into equation (8.291), we have 
1 
Eh [Nx,yy + Ny,xx -
J-L(Nx,xx + Ny,yy) - 2(1 + J-L)Nxy,xyJ 
= (Dz,xy)2 - Dz,xxDz,yy 
(8.294) 
Equation (8.294) and equation (8.252) constitute the compatibility and equilib-
rium equations, respectively. 
There are still four unknowns remaining in the two equations, so that further 
refinement is necessary. 
If a stress function ~ is defined such that

8 Bending of Plates 
(8.295c) 
and equations (8.295a-c) are introduced into equations (8.294) and (8.252), we 
obtain 
(8.296) 
and 
(8.297) 
which are known as von Karman equations for the large deflection of plates, 
after the famous contemporary mechanician. 
The von Karman equations are coupled and nonlinear. The nonlinearity 
arises from the relaxation of assumption [lJ, and the enforcement of this 
assumption immediately reduces equation (8.297) to the equation of the linear 
theory, equation (8.12). Also, the equations are written in invariant form and 
thus may be readily transformed to other coordinate systems. Y. C. Fung52 
observed that the r.h.s. of equation (8.296) is related to the Gaussian curvature 
of the deformed surface. From equation (2.38), we confirm that (Dz ,Xy)2 -
Dz,xxDz, yy = b, the discriminant of the deformed surface, so that if the plate is 
bent into a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature) such as a cylinder, 
the r.h.s. of equation (8.296) vanishes. 
We may investigate this in more detail by referring to the cylindrically bent 
plate shown on figure 8-7, which was treated in section 8.2.1.3. Because of the 
single curvature, Dz,xx = Dz, yX = 0 and the r.h.s. of equation (8.297) reduces to 
1 
Dz,yyyy = D (qz + NyDz,yy) 
(8.298) 
Dz, yy is left in general form rather than being evaluated from equation (8.66), 
since the presence of Ny will modify Dz somewhat. Equation (8.298) is a fourth 
order ordinary linear differential equation with a constant coefficient, which is 
readily solved by classical methods. The homogeneous solution is written as 
(8.299a) 
where 
(8.299b) 
with the particular solution depending on the form of qz. 
For example, if qz = qo = constant, 
(8.300) 

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation

With Ny initially specified, this problem is analogous to an axially loaded 
beam and may be investigated further for various boundary conditions along 
the Y axis. However, when the boundaries parallel to the X axis are restrained 
in the middle plane, Ny is initially unknown. Referring to the cylindrical cross 
section in figure 8-7, this force may be determined from the compatibility 
condition whereby the extension of the plate in the Y direction produced by Ny 
must be equal to the difference between the final arc length, Sy, and the initial 
length in the Y direction, taken as 2b. 
To compute the extension of the plate in the Y-direction, we neglect the 
contribution of Dz to By in equation (8.289b) so that By :::,; By. We then substitute 
By = Dy,y into equation (8.293b) to find 
1 
Dy,y = Eh (Ny - IlNx ) 
(8.301) 
Further, we assume that ex = 0 in equation (8.293a) and use the resulting 
Nx = IlNy in equation (8.301) to get 
N y (1 -
1l2 ) 
D y , y = 
Eh 
(8.302) 
from which 
D = Ny(1 - IlZ) Y 
y 
Eh 
(8.303) 
since Dy(O) = O. 
To express Dy as the difference between the final arc length and the initial 
length in the Y direction, refer to equation (2.46) with Sz replaced by Sy, dZ 
by dY, and dRo by dDz. Since the deformation is symmetric, we need consider 
only half the plate (0 < Y < b). Then, from equation (2.46), 
Sy = f: [1 + (DZ,y)Zr/2 dY 
We use the binomial expansions 1 to simplify equation (8.304) as 
Sy:::'; b + ~ f: (Dz,yfdY 
so that 
Dy = Sy -
b = ~ f: (Dz,y)ZdY 
Equation (8.303), evaluated at Y = b, and equation (8.306) give

8 Bending of Plates 
Equation (8.307) along with equations (8.299a) and (8.299b) and a particular 
solution such as equation (8.300) constitute the solution to the problem of 
cylindrical bending when the in-plane displacements of the middle surface are 
restrained. An obvious iterative solution algorithm is to begin with an assumed 
value of Ny; compute the integration constants in equation (<8.299a) using the 
appropriate boundary conditions on Dz ; and finally, check the assumed Ny 
using equation (8.307). Solutions of the cylindrical bending problem are avail-
able in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger.53 
For equations (8.296) and (8.297), a limited number of analytical solutions 
using the Navier approach are available,54 but the calculations are quite 
involved and numerical solutions are attractive. 
An important point which might be investigated with solutions based on the 
finite deflection theory of plates is the limit of the small deflection theory. 
Specifically, we are interested in two points: (a) how large the normal displace-
ment Dz must be in order to obtain stress couples significantly different from 
those calculated using elementary plate theory; and, (b) how significant are 
the in-plane stress resultants accompanying the finite transverse displacement? 
These questions are difficult to answer in general but may be studied for circular 
plates, as we will show in the next section. 
8.7.6 Finite Deformation ofAxisymmetrically Loaded Circular Plates: Con-
sider an axisymmetrically loaded circular plate. Instead of the general expres-
sion, equation (8.2), it is convenient to start with the equilibrium equations 
specialized for axisymmetric loading. Equation (8.2S3a) gives 
(8.308) 
Another relationship is found from generalizing equation (8.32b), which fol-
lowed from equation (3.2Sc) through equations (8.1)-(8.S). The first term in the 
axisymmetric form of equation (8.247) is [R(QR + NRDz,R)J.R when a = R, 
B = R, and transverse shearing strains are suppressed. This leads to a modified 
transverse shear, QR + NRDz,R' so that equation (8.32b) becomes 
QR + NRDz,R = D (DZ'RRR + ~ DZ,RR - ~2 DZ'R) 
(8.309) 
From section 8.3.1.4, we recall that for an axisymmetric loading qR(R), QR(R) 
can be directly expressed in terms of qR' so that QR may be regarded as a known 
quantity in what follows. 
Now, we use the strain-displacement relations for polar coordinates, which 
are obtained from equations (8.262) and (8.263) together with (S.S4a) and (S.S4b), 
to write 
(8.310) 
and 

8.7 Instability and Finite Deformation

Substituting 8R and 80 in the stress-strain laws, equation (6.10), we find

and 
Eh 
[DR 
J1 
2J 
NIJ = 1 _ J12 I{ + J1DR,R + 2 (DZ,R) 
(8.313) 
Finally, we substitute equations (8.312) and (8.313) into equations (8.308) and 
(8.309) to get 
(8.314) 
and 
(8.315) 
which are again coupled and nonlinear. 
These equations are studied for several cases of applied loading and for a 
variety of boundary conditions in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger. 55 Of 
particular interest for our purposes is the case of a simply supported solid plate 
with edge moment M as shown in figure 8-15. For this case, QR = qz = O. 
Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger present a numerical solution for a plate 
of thickness h, radius a ~ 23h, and M = MR(a) = 2.93 x 1O- 3(D/h). With respect 
to the comparison with elementary plate theory as discussed in the previous 
section, there are two items of major interest: (a) the magnitude of the displace-
ments and moments calculated from the nonlinear theory, as compared to those 
computed from the elementary theory; and, (b) the significance of the in-plane 
stress resultants NR and No, which are not computable from the elementary 
theory. 
Considering first the displacements, the maximum transverse deflection Dz ~ 
0.55h. From equation (8.121) Dz(O) = 0.62h for J1 = 0.25, so that the refined 
theory gives about a 10% smaller deflection. The elementary theory has stress 
couples MR = Mo = M = constant throughout the plate, whereas the refined 
theory yields values for MR and Mo at the center which are about 12% less. 

364 
8 Bending of Plates 
Thus, the elementary theory appears to be conservative and fairly accurate for 
deflections up to about one-half the plate thickness. 
To assess the significance of the in-plane stress resultants, we must refer to 
actual stresses, rather than the stress resultants. From elementary strength of 
materials and the definitions in chapter 3, 
(
h) 
N; 
6M; 
O'u ±"2 =h±V 
(8.316) 
The stress resultants NR and N9 are both tensile and relatively small in the 
central portion of the plate. In the outer portion, NR -+ 0 and N9/h becomes 
compressive and reaches a magnitude of almost 20% of 6M/h2 , where M is the 
constant moment of the elementary theory. From this, we conclude that with 
deflections approaching the half-thickness of the plate, the seemingly simple 
case of uniform moment may be susceptible to circumferential instability be-
cause of the relatively high compressive values of N9 • 
This study has provided us with an opportunity to assess the validity and 
limitations of one of the important assumptions in the elementary theory of 
plates, assumption [lJ.

CHAPTER 9 
Shell Bending and Instability 
9.1 General 
In earlier chapters, we derived the equilibrium, strain-displacement, and con-
stitutive equations and stated the required boundary conditions for the bending 
theory of shells, referred to a system of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. 
Also, we developed strain energy and potential energy expressions that can be 
incorporated into an energy formulation of the shell theory. In this chapter, 
these equations are specialized for various classes of shells, as we have done for 
the membrane theory equations in chapter 4. 
Before proceeding, again note that many shells may achieve equilibrium 
through membrane action alone, provided the requisite conditions are closely 
approached by the actual shell. For such shells, bending is a secondary phe-
nomenon often confined to narrow regions near boundaries, geometric dis-
continuities, and concentrated loads. On the other hand, there are shells for 
which the membrane theory idealization is grossly violated by the physical 
situation. The bending behavior may alter the stress pattern from that com-
puted by the membrane theory in two ways: (a) significant transverse shearing 
forces and bending and twisting moments can develop; and, (b) the pattern of 
the in-plane stress resultants may be altered markedly by the bending deforma-
tions. Although a shell may seriously violate the membrane theory require-
ments, there still remains the possibility of resisting transverse loading primarily 
with in-plane forces, which is the basic initial attraction of this structural form. 
It is this latter possibility, whereby the transverse loading may be resisted by a 
combination of in-plane forces and transverse shearing forces, which distin-
guishes bending of shells from the elementary behavior of plates. 
In the study of shell bending, cylindrical and conical shells are frequently con-
sidered apart from rotational and translational shells, although they technically 
may fall into one or both of these classes. The bending behavior of shells with 
zero Gaussian curvature is quite distinct, however, since in the direction where 
the radius of curvature is infinite, these shells cannot develop any membrane 
forces to resist the transverse loading. As we have seen in chapter 4, the 
membrane theory solutions for such shells generally show the entire transverse 
loading being sustained in the curved direction, a one-way resistance pattern. 
When the membrane boundary conditions in the curved direction are violated 
372 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
373 
and rendered incapable of developing the required reactions, drastic alteration 
of the stress pattern is often the result because the zero curvature direction is 
of no help except in a bending mode. 
Another important reason for studying cylindrical shells, especially, as a 
distinct class is that fairly simple analytical solutions may be found, whereas 
for more complex geometries, such solutions are relatively scarce. Moreover, 
many of the techniques for solving the governing equations for other geometries 
involve various approximations and simplifications that cast the equations into 
a form similar to that of the cylindrical shell. Thus, the cylindrical shell solutions 
assume added importance from the standpoint of generality. 
Finally, we note that in practice, cylindrical shells are probably the most 
frequently encountered form and certainly merit careful attention. 
9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
9.2.1 Specialization of Equations: In the discussion of the membrane theory of 
circular cylindrical shells (section 4.3.3.2), we chose cx = Z, f3 = e, A = 1, and 
B = a, as shown in figure 4-12(a). For this geometry, R" = 00 and Rp = a. 
Then, in section 4.4.1, the axial coordinate was taken as X in deference to its 
widespread usage in current literature. We should feel comfortable with either 
choice. For vertical vessels in which the axis of rotation coincides with the global 
Z axis, rx = Z is the logical choice, whereas for horizontal shells, cx = X seems 
equally suitable. We use cx= X in this chapter. 
The force equilibrium equations, (3.l7a-c), and moment equilibrium equa-
tions, (3.22a) and (3.22b), become

The constitutive relations are given by matrix 6-2, with IX and f3 taken as X and 
e, respectively. These are restated here only in the matrix form of equation (6.10) 
(9.4) 
with the subscripts serving to remind us of our choice of coordinates. 
It is easily verified that the membrane theory equations are recoverable from 
the preceding expressions. With the bending terms neglected and Nex = Nxe = 
S, equations (9.1a-c) reduce to equations (4.160) and equations (9.2a-c), and 
the corresponding parts of equation (9.4) are identical to equations (6.50). 
9.2.2 Axisymmetrical Loading 
9.2.2.1 Displacement Formulation and Solution. Axisymmetrically loaded cir-
cular cylindrical shells are employed as pressure vessels and tanks in many 
industrial applications. Some examples are shown in figures 2-8(r) and (u). For

where D has been defined explicitly in equation (S.4d). When transverse shearing 
strains are suppressed, equation (9.Se) is of no use, so that Qx must be evaluated 
from equation (9.5c). 
We now express the equilibrium equations in terms of the displacements in 
the classical fashion of a displacement formulation. 
First, we substitute equations (9.6a-d) into equations (9.Sa-e) to get the 
stress resultants and couples in terms of the displacements. Also, in view of 
equations (6.9), we set NXT = NeT = NT and MXT = MeT = M T. Then, we

The loading and thermal terms are presumed as known and transposed to 
the r.h.s. The resulting set of three equations in the three unknowns Dx , Dn, 
and DX(J constitutes the displacement formulation. We will not reduce these 
equations further, but concentrate on the theory in which transverse shearing 
strains are neglected. 
With Yx = 0, DX(J is expressed in terms of Dn by equation (9.6d). We need 
retain only the first of equations (9.11), along with a new equation found by 
substituting equations (9.9b) and (9.lOc) into equation (9.5b):

This set may be reduced to a single equation. We first integrate both sides of 
equation (9. 12a), which gives 
1 :hJ-l2 (Dx,x + ~Dn) = - f

(9.13a) 
where C is an integration constant. 
Comparing equation (9.13a) with equation (9.9a), we find 
Nx = - f

(9.13b) 
We may rewrite the integral in equation (9.13b) in the alternate form introduced 
in chapter 4 by choosing C = Nx(O). Then, we have 
Nx(X) = - LX qx dX + Nx(O)

Equation (9.16a) may be recognized as the governing equation for a well-

9 Shell Bending and Instability 
documented problem in mechanics, the bending of a prismatic beam on an elas-
tic foundation.! Just as an elastic foundation takes a portion of any transverse 
loading applied to a beam, the shell parameter Eh/a2 , which appears explicitly 
in equation (9.15), supplements the flexural rigidity D of the cylindrical shell 
in resisting the transverse loading qn. Once the governing equation is solved 
for Dn , the extensional stress resultants are computed from equations (9.9a) 
and (9.9b), and the stress couples and transverse shear resultant from equations 
(9.10a-c). 
It is instructive to consider a somewhat specialized case, in which the thermal 
terms are dropped and the axial load qx = O. Then, from equation (9.13c), 
Nx = constant. If one boundary-e.g., X = O-is unconstrained against axial 
deformation, Nx(O) = 0 and, therefore, Nx = 0 throughout the shell. With these 
simplifications, equation (9.9a) gives 
and equation (9.9b) becomes 
Eh 
Ne =-Dn 
a 
(9.17) 
(9.18) 
which is a remarkably simple algebraic relationship between the major stress 
resultant and the primary displacement, considering the complexity of the 
system with which we began. 
The displacement formulation of the axisymmetrically loaded cylindrical 
shell may be generalized in a straightforward matter to accommodate shells 
in which the thickness varies as h = h(X). 
Continuing with equation (9. 16a), the homogeneous solution is written from 
the auxiliary equation 
(9.19a) 
with roots 
m = ±k(1 + i), ±k(1 -
i) 
(9.19b) 
(9.20) 
where C1 -C4 are integration constants. 
The particular solution is, of course, dependent on the loading, and the con-
stants C1-C4 are found from applying the appropriate boundary conditions, 
as we see in several examples later. 
9.2.2.2 Semi-infinite Cylindrical Shells. The complete solution of equation 
(9. 16a) involves four integration constants, as indicated in equation (9.20). This 
constitutes a two-point boundary value problem. Within the class ofaxisym-

Semi-infinite Edge-Loaded Cylindrical Shell 
metrically loaded cylindrical shells, however, there are many cases for which 
the forces at one boundary do not materially affect those at the other boundary. 
Such shells are termed semi-infinite. 
We may demonstrate this behavior by referring to equation (9.20). If X is 
measured from one boundary, the factor ekX will grow very large as X increases 
unless C3 = C4 = 0, whereas the factor e-kX will cause the other terms to 
attenuate. Thus, the solution simplifies to 
(9.21) 
with C1 and C2 evaluated from the boundary conditions at X = O. 
The semi-infinite approach simplifies the ensuing arithmetic considerably. 
The range of shell parameters for which this assumption is valid may be 
determined by considering a shell with an arbitrary edge loading and observing 
the behavior of the solution as the distance from the loaded boundary increases. 
As shown in figure 9-1, a transverse shear force Qo and bending moment Mo 
are applied uniformly around the circumference at X = O. The positive signs 
are chosen in accordance with figure 3-2. We have, from equations (9. lOa) and 
(9.10c), 
Mo = Mx(O) = -DDn,xx(O) 
Qo = Qx(O) = - DDn,xxx(O)

Before we carry the solution further, it is convenient to define the functions 
F1(kX) = e-kX(coskX + sinkX) 
F2(kX) = e-kX(cos kX - sin kX) 
F3(kX) = e-kX cos kX = t(Fl + F2)

F2)

(9.24b)

(9.24d) 
Now, we may express Dn and the various derivatives required to obtain other 
components of the solution by matrix 9-l. 
Since Fl (0) = F2 (0) = 1 and decrease as X increases, and since F3 and F4 are 
linear combinations of Fl and F2, the behavior of Fl (X) and F2(X) is indicative 
of the propagation of the effects of the boundary loads. These functions are 
plotted on figure 9-2 and are tabulated in Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger 
and Tsui. 2 It is apparent from the figure that the edge loads will produce 
insignificant effects at about kX = 3.

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
381 
In the literature, it is common to find L ~ n/k designated as the length for 
which a given shell is considered to be a long shell and, therefore, treatable by 
the semi-infinite approach. L is called the half-wave length of bending and may 
be written as 
L= 
n 
fo 
~3(1 -
f1.)2 
(9.25) 
using equation (9. 16b). 
Beyond this particular case, L is often used as a measure of the penetration 
of the effect of various singularities, such as concentrated loads, holes, and 
discontinuities, into the interior of a shell. Also, Calladine has established 
a relationship between the extensional and flexural resisting modes of shells 
based on the change in Gaussian curvature during distortion. In his scheme, 
the characteristic fo term plays a central role. 3 
Note that the edge effects that have been discussed here, Qo and Mo, are 
self-equilibrating with respect to the overall equilibrium of the shell. The corre-
sponding dissipation of these edge disturbances may be regarded as a demon-
stration of St. Venant's principle, which we have mentioned in connection with 
the derivation ofthe Kirchhoff boundary conditions in section 6.2.3. Recall that 
there may be another type of edge effect which is not self-equilibrated and 
readily penetrates to the opposite boundary. An example is the axial line load 
N shown in figure 4-12(b) and discussed in section 4.3.3.2. This is clearly 
shown by equation (9.13c) with Nx(O) = N. We should be careful to reserve 
the semi-infinite simplification for cases with self-equilibrating edge loads, such 
as Qx and Mo· 
Finally, with respect to the problem illustrated on figure 9-1, we may obtain 
explicit expressions for the stress resultants from equations (9. lOa-c), (9.18), and 
matrix 9-1: 
Mx(X) = -DDn,xx = MoFl(kX) + ~o F4(kX)

application of P. A free-body diagram of the narrow ring under the load,

This solution is of interest in the case of a cylindrical shell with a circular ring 
stiffener, which we consider later, and also in generating solutions for loading 
distributed in the X direction by using the Green's function approach. 
9.2.2.4 Axially Distributed Loading. We now consider a radial load uniformly 
distributed around the circumference but arbitrarily distributed along the X 
axis, as shown in figure 9-4. To treat this problem from a general standpoint, 
we choose the Green's function technique. In this approach, the response of 
the shell to a single concentrated load acting at a point of application C, which 
is arbitrarily located within the loaded region, is studied first. The influence of 
this load is evaluated at a specified point of observation. Then, the effect of the 
entire distributed load at the point of observation is computed by integrating 
over the loaded region. In this general example, we must treat two separate 
cases: (a) point of observation outside the loaded region of the shell, such as 
point A in figure 9-4; and, (b) point of observation within the loaded region of 
the shell, such as point B in figure 9-4. 
We first select the point of observation as A, outside the loaded region at 
a distance X from a convenient origin o. We then define the line load produced 
by p(,,) acting over the differential length d" at the point of application C as 
p(,,) d". The resulting displacement at A is given by equation (9.28a), with the 
argument of Fl (kX) taken as the distance between A and C, " - X: 
p(,,) d" 
D,,(A,C) = D"(X,,,) = 8k3D F1(k[,,-X])

Then, the displacement due to the entire distributed loading is found as 
Dn(A) = Dn(X) = In=~~2 Dn(X,1'/)d1'/ 
which is easily evaluated once p(X) [or p(1'/)] is specified. 
(9.31) 
Second, locate the point of observation at B, within the loaded region. Point B 
is a distance X = d 1 + b1 from the origin 0, and is a distance ~ from the point 
of application C. The displacement at B due to the line load p(~) d~ is 
and the displacement of B due to the entire load is found to be 
Dn(B) = Dn(X) = I~=:l Dn(X,~) d~ + I~=:2 Dn(X,~) d~ 
(9.32) 
(9.33) 
where b2 = d2 -
d1 -
b1 . For both integrals in the preceding equation, the 
coordinate ~ is positive as measured from point B. 
For a point of observation at the edge of the loaded region, A and Bare 
coincident and equations (9.31) and (9.33) should be identical. With b1 = 0, 
b2 = d2 -
d 1 in equation (9.33), and the identity is confirmed. 
The stress resultants and couples for specific loadings p(X) may be evaluated 
by similiar integrations or by subsequent differentiations of the computed 
Dn(X), as indicated in equations (9.26).

9.2.2.5 Built-In Shell under Internal Pressure and Temperature Gradient. Next, 
we examine the cylindrical shell shown in figure 9-5(a), which is subject to 
a uniform internal pressure p and a linear temperature gradient-Tl on the 
outside and T2 on the inside. Both the pressure and the thermal gradient are 
taken as constant along the length of the shell, and the ends are fixed against 
translation and rotation. We again assume that L is sufficiently large so that 
semi-infinite analysis is valid. A similar problem is considered by Kraus using 
the more general short-shell solution,4 but for only a uniform temperature 
change through the thickness. 
Proceeding, we have the homogeneous solution from equation (9.21) 
Dnh = e-kX(C1 cos kX + C2 sin kX) = C 1F3(kX) + C2 F4 (kX) 
(9.34) 
We now examine equation (9.16a) with respect to the construction of a particular 
solution and consider each term on ther.h.s. individually.

To find the contribution of the temperature gradient, we first evaluate NT and 
MT from equations (6.9a) and (6.9b). It is helpful to resolve the linear gradient 
into symmetric and antisymmetric components, as shown in figure 9-5(b):

Since MT,xx = qx = 0 in this case, no particular solutions are required for these

We may make an interesting observation concerning the particular solution 
by referring to our treatment of membrane theory displacements for cylindrical 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells

shells in section 6.3.4.1. Specifically, we consider the relevant part of equation 
(6.53) for the membrane theory normal displacement 
(9.42a) 
Now, we substitute the membrane theory stress resultant N(l> as given by equation 
(4.62b), 
N()=pa 
along with 
Nx =0 
into equation (9.42a), which gives 
pa2 
Dn = Dnml = Eh

(9.42d) 
which is the same as equation (9.35). For the thermal term, referring to 
equations (6.9a) and (6.9b), we introduce

(9.43c) 
which matches equation (9.40b). We thus have quantified the earlier assertion 
that the membrane theory solution frequently serves as a particular solution to 
the bending theory equations. 
We now proceed with the general solution, which is the sum of equations 
(9.34) and (9.41), by enforcing the boundary conditions 
and 
Dx()(O) = -Dn,x(O) = 0

Explicit expressions for the stress resultants and couples may be written by 
substituting the preceding solution into equations (9.9) and (9.10). This is 
routine and is omitted for brevity. However, we may surmise from our previous 
studies of the semi-infinite cylindrical shell that the homogeneous part of the 
solution Dnh will be most influential near the ends and will diminish as X 
increases, whereas the particular part Dnp , which is also the membrane theory 
solution, will predominate away from the ends. Also, note from equation (9.10) 
that there will be bending in the shell~even after the effects of Dnh diminish~ 
because of the constant thermal moment M T • 
9.2.2.6 Short Cylindrical Shells. When the distance between boundary points, 
L, is such that L < n/k, the semi-infinite assumption is no longer valid, and the 
general solution, (9.20), should be used. We consider the extension of the 
edge-loaded cylinder problem, shown in figure 9-1, to the case where line 
moments and transverse shear forces are applied to both ends (figure 9-6). 
We first rewrite equation (9.20) as 
where 
Fs(kX) = e-kX cos kX 
F6(kX) = e-kX sin kX 
F7 (kX) = ekX cos kX 
F8(kX) = ekX sin kX

We now turn to the tedious calculation of the derivatives of Dnh • We first 
evaluate 
and then continue with the differentiation in operator notation, e.g. D n = 
d n( )/dXn 
Fs(kX) = Fs 
D1FS = -kFs -
kF6 
D2FS = Dl(D1FS) = -kD1Fs - kD1F6 
F6(kX) = F6 
D1F6 = -kF6 + kFs 
D2F6 = Dl(D1F6) = -kD1F6 + kD1FS 
D3F6 = Dl(D2F6) = -kD2F6 + kD2Fs 
F7(kX) = F7 
D1F7 = kF7 - kFs 
D2F7 = Dl(D1F7) = kD1F7 - kDIFg 
D3F7 = Dl(D2F7) = kD2F7 - kD2Fg 
Fg(kX) = Fg 
D1Fs = kFg + kF7 
D2Fg = Dl(DlFg) = kDIFg + kD1F7 
D3Fg = Dl(D2Fg) = kD2Fg + kD2F7 
By repeated substitution, the various derivatives can be written in terms of 
Fs-Fg: 
D1Fs = -k(Fs + F6) 
D2FS = 2k2F6 
D3 Fs = 2k3(Fs - F6)

Although {C} may be written explicitly in algebraic form, the resulting expres-

by specifying numerical values for the shell parameters and performing the 
inversion and multiplication. We shall regard the problem as essentially solved 
at this point and consider an application. 
9.2.2.7 Ring-Stiffened Cylindrical Shells. Ring-stiffened cylindrical tubes are 
commonly used for pressure vessels, submersible vehicles, and rockets. An 
example is shown in figure 2-8(r), and an idealization is depicted in figure 9-7. 
The rings are often relatively close together, so that the semi-infinite simplifica-
tion may not be valid.

Fig. 9-7 Ring-Stiffened Cylindrical Shell 
As the cylinder deforms in the radial direction, the ring will retard the ex-
pansion or contraction. The resulting contact force between the cylinder and 
the stiffener is shown as P in figure 9-7. This problem is somewhat similar in 
concept to that shown in figure 4-4, where the ring beam of a dome is analyzed. 
In that case, the strain incompatibility at the interface of the shell and the beam 
could not be resolved because of the limitations of the membrane theory. Here, 
however, we are able to enforce the deformation compatibility between the ring 
stiffener and the shell. 
We assume that the stiffener thickness hs « L, so that the reaction can be 
considered to act on the shell as a radial line load. We take the inside radius of 
the stiffener as a = a + hj2, where a is the radius at the shell middle surface and 
h is the shell thickness. Also, b is the width of the stiffener. In practice, the 
stiffeners may be located on the inside of the shell, requiring a slight modification 
of the solution. 
The radial deformation ofthe ring stiffener due to the line load P (forcejlength 
of circumference) is easily computed by considering the stiffener to be a short 
cylindrical shell with radius = a + bj2, thickness = b, and length = hs • Then we 
apply equation (6.53) which, for the loading and geometry under consideration, 
reduces to 
[a + (bj2)] 
Dn = Ds =

(9.56a)

(9.56b) 
so that the stiffener deformation in terms of the unknown contact force P is

(9.56c) 
Now, we examine the forces acting on the shell. We assume the loading 
is a uniform internal pressure p, so that the particular solution is given by 
equation (9.35): 
(9.57) 
Also, we have the force P applied to the shell by the ring stiffener. Assuming P 
is directed outward on the ring, as depicted on the figure, an equal and opposite 
force reacts on the shell, as shown in the inset. This is the same situation depicted 
in figure 9-3, but with the sense reversed. Thus, we may find end conditions 
from equations (9.27), referring to figure 9-6 for the correct algebraic signs for 
Qx(O) = QA and Qx(L) = QB:

Substituting equations (9.58a) and (9.58c) into the second and fourth rows of 
matrix 9-2. and equations (9.58b) and (9.58d) into equation (9.54) yields four 
equations in the four unknown integration constants C1-C4 and the contact 
force P. We obtain an additional relationship by equating the radial displace-
ments of the shell and the stiffener: 
(9.59) 
where Dnh is given by equation (9.52a), Dnp by equation (9.57), and Ds by 
equation (9.56c). 
As mentioned previously, the short-shell solution is best carried out by 
inserting numerical values pertaining to the case at hand. We may, however, 
easily proceed for the case where L > n/k and the semi-infinite solution is valid. 
We need only the end conditions given by equations (9.58a) and (9.58b), and 
may immediately write

from equation (9.29a) with the appropriate sign change. Correspondingly, 
equation (9.59) becomes

(9.61) 
from which P is found. Then, the remaining stress resultants and couples are

Krieger. 2 If the shell is closed at both ends, an axial stress resultant

For loading cases which are nonaxisymmetrical, circumferential shear forces 
Nxo are developed between the shell and the stiffeners. An additional compati-
bility relationship, equating the circumferential displacements of the shell and 
the stiffener, is needed to evaluate these contact forces, which may be eccentric 
to the centroid of the stiffener and also produce circumferential bending mo-
ments Mo. In reinforced concrete barrel shells, discussed in sections 9.2.3.1 and 
9.2.3.3, the stiffeners are generally integral with the shell and can be treated 
using an "effective width" concept. 5 
9.2.3 General Loading 
9.2.3.1 Displacement Formulation and Solution. The analysis of cylindrical shells 
for nonaxisymmetrical surface loading commands a prominent place in the 
literature, and a comprehensive presentation is beyond our objectives in this 
text. We should mention, however, that the formulation and application of 
this theory have attracted the contributions of some of the most prominent 
twentieth-century mechanicians and engineers to the extensive literature on 
the subject, including L. H. Donnell, J. Kempner, H. Schorer (Swiss), N. J. Hoff 
and A. Parme in the United States; A. Aas Jakobsen in Norway; H. Reissner,

W. Fliigge, U. Finsterwalder, F. Dischinger, and W. Zerna in Germany; J. E. 
Gibson and R. S. Jenkins in Great Britain; E. Torroja in Spain; and V. V. 
Novozhilov, A. I. Lur'e, and V. Z. Vlasov in the USSR. Comprehensive historical 
reviews of these works are found in Fliigge6 from the Western standpoint, and 
in Novozhilov 7 from the Soviet standpoint. Apparently, the Soviet work in this 
field did not have much impact in the West until the publication of the English 
language translation of Vlasov's monograph. 8 This formulation is applicable 
to open, as well as closed, cylindrical shells. As such, one of tbe first prominent 
applications was to the design of so-called barrel shell roofs, figure 2-8(h). An 
interesting account of the development of this form for shell roofs in Germany 
by Finsterwalder and his associates, and the subsequent technology transfer to 
the United States by A. Tedesko, is provided by Billington.9 
We begin the displacement formulation, with transverse shearing strains 
neglected, by eliminating the transverse shear stress resultants from equations 
(9.1b) and (9.1c), using equations (9.1d) and (9.1e). We also take Nox = Nxo 
and Mox = M xo, leaving the three equilibrium equations

We may simplify equations (9.66b) and (9.66c) by examining the terms 
multiplied by h2/a2. We will drop all such terms as being ofO(h2/a2): 1. At this 
point, this step involves some presumption. Whereas the first two terms of 
the (h 2 /12a 2 ) [ 
] expression in equation (9.66b) have corresponding terms in 
the same equation that are of 0(1), the remaining terms and all terms contained 
in (h 2/12a 2 )[ ] in equations (9.66c) involve derivatives not found elsewhere 
in the equation. Nevertheless, this assumption, if not fully justified, has been 
found to give good results for a wide class of problems and greatly simplifies 
the remaining derivation and solution. A discussion of the possible errors 
introduced by this step is contained in Kraus. 10 
Insofar as equation (9.66b) is concerned, we may regard the suppression 
of the 0(h 2/a 2 ) terms as being equivalent to neglecting the influence of the 
stress couples on the in-plane equilibrium equation. Also, ignoring the 
0(h2 /a2) terms in equation (9.66c) is equivalent to replacing the displacement-
curvature relationships, equations (9.3), by the corresponding equations for 
a plate. The later equations are given by equations (5.55), with IX = X and f3 =

is the harmonic operator in the X -() cylindrical coordinate system. Kraus l1 
has derived a similar set of equations, applicable for noncircular cylindrical 
shells as well, by neglecting the stress couples in equation (9.64b) and using 
equations (9.67) for the changes in curvatures at the outset. The only perceptible 
difference appears to be that the thermal moment gradient term in P(J, M T ,(J/a2, 
is not present in his equations. 
It is easily verified that for axisymmetric loading, equations (9.68a) and 
(9.68c) are identical to equations (9.12a), and (9.12b), which reduce ultimately 
to equations (9.16a) and (9.16b).

vatives as suggested by Kraus: l1 (a) iJ2/oX2 (equation [9.68a]); (b) 02/0()2 
(equation [9.68a]); (c) 02/0XO() (equation [9.68b]); and, (d) solution of (a) and 
(b) for the mixed partials of De:

denominator a(1 + ~) to get 
(9.71)

We may derive a similar equation for Do by interchanging equations (9.68a) 
and (9.68b) in the aforementioned mixed partial operations (a), (b), and (c) and 
solving (a) and (b) for the mixed partials of Dx. This produces

Finally, we may isolate the normal displacement Dn. The procedure is: (a)

Equations (9.71), (9.73), and (9.75) are among the most famous equations in 
the theory of thin shells and are commonly referred to as, alternately, Donnell's 
equations, Jenkins's equations, or Vlasov's equations. The eighth order system 
is uncoupled for the displacements, so that once Dn is determined from 
equation (9.75), Dx and De may be found by solving equations (9.71) and (9.73), 
respectively. These equations are also used, with slight elaboration, to study 
the dynamic response of circular cylindrical shells. 12 
The appropriate boundary conditions for the foregoing equations are estab-
lished from figure 6-3, with a = X and P = e. The relationships in which there 

400 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
are no transverse shearing strains included are applicable here. Note that the 
equations derived pertain to open, as well as to closed, circular cylindrical shells. 
For closed shells, the boundary conditions in the () direction are replaced by 
continuity conditions of the form f(O) = f(2n), where f(() is a function which 
is continuous at () = O. 
Before considering some specific applications, it is instructive to make some 
general comments on the analytical solution of the governing equations for 
this theory, equations (9.71), (9.73) and (9.75), or, alternately, the coupled 
equations (9.68a-c). Complete solutions are fairly complicated algebraically, 
but are extensively documented in specialized works, such as Fliigge.13 
Briefly, the solutions of the homogeneous equations for edge loadings at 
X = it = constant are of interest for both open and closed· shells and are 
obtained by taking the Fourier expansions 
{ 
DXh} 
{DJch(X) COSj()} 
DlJh 
= i~O 
D~h(X) sinjO 
Dnh 
D~h(X)COSjO 
(9.76) 
Note that for closed shells, Dih(O) = Dih(2n)(i = X, (), n), which serve as the con-
tinuity or periodicity conditions. Then, for a general harmonic j, the substitution 
of equations (9.76) into the governing equations gives an eighth order algebraic 
system. The solution ultimately takes the general form 
Ri(X,() = CG{C{[e-glx(f!Cosg3x - fising3x)] 
+ CHe-g 1X(flcosg3x + f/sing3x)] 
+ Q[e-g2x(fi cosg4x - fjsing4x)] 
+ Ci[e-g2x(f1 cos g4X + fi sin g4X)] 
+ Q[eg 1x(f!cosg3x + fising3x)] 
+ CHeg 1X(-flcosg3x + f/sing3x )] 
+ CHeg2X(ficosg4x + fjsinY4x)J 
+ q[eY2X( -flcosg4x + fising3x)J} (C~~()) 
SInJ() 
(9.77) 
in which Ri(X, () = a typical displacement, stress resultant, or stress couple for 
harmonic j; x = X/a; 91 - g4 are quantities dependent on j, the dimensions 
of the shell, and the material properties; f!-fi are quantities dependent onj, 
the dimensions of shell, and the material properties for each individual Ri; CG 
is a constant dependent on the shell geometry and material properties; and 
C{ -q are constants of integration. 
In the general case, all eight constants are needed, and hence eight boundary 
conditions in the X direction are required, whereas for a semi-infinite shell, 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
401 
those terms associated with q-q are suppressed, and therefore only four 
boundary conditions are needed. 
For an edge loading at X = X, such as we studied for axisymmetric loading, 
the integration constants are determined by first substituting the respective 
displacements, Ri(X, 0), into the stress resultant-displacement relations, equa-
tions (9.65); and then setting those expressions corresponding to the specified 
edge loadings equal to their boundary values, Nx(X), NX9(X), Qx(X), and/or 
Mx(X). Additional equations may be obtained by the specification of kinematic 
boundary conditions Dx(X), D9(X), Dn(X), and/or D9X(X), For a semi-infinite 
shell, X corresponds to X = 0, whereas for a complete shell, X stands for X = L 
as well. 
Next, we consider the homogeneous solutions for a shell with an edge loading 
applied at a boundary 0 = (j = constant. Obviously, this case is pertinent only 
for open cylindrical shells, such as those discussed in section 4.4.1. Here, series

are widely used. An eighth order algebraic system must be evaluated for each 
harmonic component k, from which the solution may be expressed in the same 
form as equation (9.77), with j replaced by k, and the coordinates X and 0 
interchanged:

Again, the effects at opposite boundaries may be uncoupled by using the 
semi-infinite approach. Because the coordinate lines normal to the loaded 
boundaries are curved in this case, the effects of the boundary forces may be 
expected to dissipate more rapidly than those for the previously studied case, in 
which in-plane forces Nx (8, X) applied at X = X can propagate along straight 
lines. After the integration constants are obtained from a specified combination 
of static and kinematic edge conditions, the homogeneous open shell solution 
is completely described. The possible static edge conditions involve 
whereas the kinematic conditions refer to 
Such solutions are used extensively in the analysis of open cylindrical shell roofs, 
and extensive tabulations are found in Design of Cylindrical Concrete Roofs. 14 
We now consider particular solutions for various applied loadings and 
thermal effects. A general approach is to take

Such solutions may be combined with the edge load solutions generated from 
equations (9.76) and (9.78) to solve a wide range of cylindrical shell problems. 
Recall from our earlier calculation of the membrane theory displacements for 
cylindrical shells (section 6.3.4.1) that the solution for the example considered 
was precisely in the format of equations (9.80), with j = k = 1. This strongly 
suggests that the membrane theory solution will serve as a particular solution 
for the bending theory equations in many instances. 
Finally, in our general discussion of solution procedures, we outline the tech-
nique of Vlasov,15 which is very attractive for certain problems. Starting with 
the three coupled equations, (9.68a-c), and using a nondimensional axial co-
ordinate X/L, he introduces a stress function 
(9.81) 
from which the three displacements Dx, De, and Dm as well as the stress 
resultants and couples, can be found by differentiation. The particular solutions 
correspond to the individual surface loading components Px, Pe, and Pn' respec-
tively, and the resulting equation is in the same form as equation (9.75) with cD 
replacing Dn. He specializes the equation for a normal loading Pn(X,8) and 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
403 
further stipulates that the shell is simply supported on all four sides. Referring 
to section 6.2.2, this corresponds to boundaries such that where X = X = 
constant, Nx = Mx = D8 = Dn = 0; and where () = e = constant, N8 = M8 = 
Dx = Dn = O. Next, he uses the Navier approach, which is familiar from plate 
solutions, to write

(). k X 
'V = L... L... 'V" slnj7t=sln 7t-=

(9.82) 
This stress function automatically satisfies the simply supported boundary 
conditions. ~k is then determined so as to satisfy the governing equation for 
each harmonic jk. 
The solution by Vlasov's technique is fairly simple to implement, although 
we do not pursue the details here. An interesting and useful result is the solution 
for a cylindrical shell under a concentrated load, which isolates the Green's 
function for such structures. 16 
9.2.3.2 Column-Supported Cylindrical Shells. We now consider a cylindrical 
tank resting on a concentric ring of equispaced columns, as shown in figure 9-8. 
The shell carries an axisymmetric loading q(X), and the transition between the 
shell and the columns is assumed to be facilitated by a ring beam. To avoid 
~rz-. q(X)

9 Shell Bending and Instability 
ambiguity in the subsequent development, it is convenient to set the origin for 
X at the top of the ring beam and to presume that the ring beam depth B « L. 
Thus, the tops of the supporting columns are also located at X = O. 
This situation is similar to that shown in figure 4-29, except that, of course, 
here the shell is cylindrical. Whereas we were able to treat the spherical geometry 
by using the membrane theory, a membrane description is inadequate for the 
column-supported cylindrical shell. This is illustrated in section 4.3.2 and by 
figure 4-12(b), which shows that a force N applied to one end simply propagates 
along the straight meridian in the absence of bending. 
Now, we turn to the problem at hand. The representation of the discrete 
supports is identical to that shown in figure 4-29, with th = nl2 and RO(rPb) = a. 
Here, we have X in place of rP for the meridional coordinate. Case (4-29 [bJ) of 
the superposition is described by a particular solution, which can be taken as 
the membrane theory solution, and a homogeneous solution, which satisfies 
the boundary conditions. The in-plane stress resultants for the particular 
solution are calculated from equations (4.58) and (4.62a), with the appropriate 
coordinate modifications: 
Q(X) 
NXbp(X) = -2-
na 
(9.83a) 
(9.83b) 
The homogeneous solution for case (4-29[bJ) is obtained from the treatment 
of axisymmetric ally loaded semi-infinite cylindrical shells in section 9.2.2.2 as 
equation (9.21). 
If the tank is supported by a circumferentially rigid ring beam, the appropriate 
boundary conditions would be 
(9.84) 
and either 
(9.85a) 
or 
(9.85b) 
depending on whether the ring beam is assumed to prevent or to permit 
rotations about the circumference. The condition for an actual shell would 
probably fall somewhere in between the two idealized situations. We will 
proceed with the former for purposes of illustration. 
To find C1 and C2 , the expressions for Dn and DXIJ evaluated at X = 0 are 
substituted into equations (9.84) and (9.85a). In tum, Dn(O) and DX(J(O) are 
composed of (a) the particular solution contributions obtained by substituting 
equations (9.83a) and (9.83b), evaluated at X = 0, into equations (6.53) and 
(6.54); and, (b) the homogeneous solution contributions, found from equation 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
405 
(9.21). Alternately, if boundary condition (9.85b) is selected, Mx(O) comes from 
equations (9.22a), whereupon C1 and C2 may be found. 
To complete case (4-29 [b]) of the superposition, MXb(X), M 8b(X), and QXb(X) 
are computed from equations (9.26a-c) and N8Xb(X) is the sum of equations 
(9.83b) and (9.26d). NXb(X) remains as the membrane theory value N Xbp' as given 
by equation (9.83a). 
Case (4-29 [c]) of the superposition is a homogenous loading condition that 
is solved following equation (9.76), with the stress resultants, couples, and 
displacements having the form of equations (9.77). The boundary conditions at 
X = 0 are given by equations (9.84) and (9.85a) or (9.85b), plus two additional 
equations. First, the ring beam may be regarded as circumferentially rigid, so 
that 
(9.86) 
The final boundary condition at the base is found from the representation of 
the meridional stress resultants Nx(O) by (a) the negative of the continuous 
boundary reaction and (b) the intensity of the column reactions, as shown on 
figure 4-29(c). This condition has been expressed earlier by equation (4.129), 
which is rewritten for the case at hand as 
Nxc(O,O) = [ - NXb(O) + bRcl] 
where b = 1 ifm(~:) -
fJ ~ 0 ~ m(~:) + fJ 
(m = - ne/2, ... , - 1,0,1, ... , ne/2) 
b = 0 for all other 0

As before, equation (9.87) is expanded in a Fourier series in 0

which gives the Fourier coefficients [see equation (4.134)]

We presume that the semi-infinite assumption is adequate for our purposes 
in stress analysis, so that we need not be concerned with the boundary condi-
tions at X = L. However, from a practical standpoint, note that open cylindrical 
tanks are generally stiffened at the top to prevent ovaling due to the propaga-
tion of the concentrated column reactions Nxc(O, 9). 
For some specific tank structures, the idealized boundary conditions stated 
in equations (9.84) and in (9.85a) or (9.85b) might warrant refinement. One 
possibility is to incorporate the ring stiffener model introduced in section 9.2.2.7 
to generalize equation (9.84). A second possibility concerns the common use of 
such a tank to contain a liquid or solid. In such vessels, a circular plate or 
perhaps a shallow cone or other rotational shell bottom would be attached 
near the ring beam level. Depending on the connection detail, additional radial 
and, perhaps, rotational restraints would be introduced. The possibilities are 
many, depending on the actual case in question, and the realistic incorporation 
of additional constraining elements into the mathematical model may alter 
the computed stress pattern significantly. 1 7 The bottom plate or shell, itself, 
would behave essentially as an axisymmetric member supported by the ring 
beam. Such structures have been discussed extensively in the preceding chapters. 
If the weight of a portion of the contents of the tank is carried directly to 
the ring beam by a bottom plate or shell, instead of being transferred through 
the shell wall, then the resultant force Q(X) in equation (9.83a) would not 
include this portion of the loading for the calculation of NXb(X) for X > 0; 
however, for case [4-29(c)] of the superposition, where NXb(O) is encountered, 
the entire load from the tank must be included in Q(O) for the calculation of 
NXb(O) and the column reaction Rei. For example, if a circular plate bottom 
were provided at X = 0 in the tank shown in figure 9-8, all of the weight of the 
internal contents would be carried directly to the ring beam if no wall friction 
was assumed. This would leave only the dead weight of the tank and roof in 
Q(X), X > 0, but the weight of the contents would be added for Q(O) in case 
[4-29(c)J. 
With the boundary conditions for the idealized problem established as equa-
tions (9.84), (9.85a) or (9.85b), (9.86), and (9.90), we set the specific expressions 
for Ri = D~, D~6 or M~, D~, and Nk [which are in the form of equation (9.77)J 
equal to the boundary values at X = 0, which are 0, 0, 0, and Nkc(O), respectively. 
Then the integration constants for harmonic j, C{ -Ci, are found from the 
simultaneous solution of the four equations. The stress resultants, couples, 
and displacements for harmonic j are then calculated from the corresponding 
specific form of equation (9.77). 
Convergence is established by the progressive diminution of the results from 
consecutive participating harmonics (j = nco 2n" .. . ). For the usual cases en-
countered, four or five harmonics should be adequate. The complete results 

9.2 Circular Cylindrical Shells 
407 
are obtained by summing the stress resultants and couples and displacements 
obtained from the specific forms of equation (9.77) over the participating 
harmonics at various circumferential locations e, and then adding these values 
to the case [4-29(b)] results. 
Fliigge18 has considered a case with a/h = 150, nc = 8, and fJ = 6°. This gives 
an amplification of 360°/(8 x 2fJ) = 360/96 = 3.75 for Nx at the base; that is, 
Rcl = 3.75NXb(0). The effect of this amplification and the corresponding change 
in No dies out at about X = a, with the stress resultants above this level 
practically equal to the membrane theory values. 
In Gould 19 the column-supported shell model is generalized to represent 
a longitudinally distributed, as opposed to a line, attachment between the column 
and the shell wall. This study is particularly applicable to elevated storage tanks, 
such as that shown in figure 2-8(u). 
9.2.3.3 Multiple Barrel Shells. A multiple barrel shell composed of adjacent 
segments of circular cylindrical shells is depicted in figure 9-9(a), with the 
positive sense of the coordinates taken from figure 4-37. An actual shell roof of 
this type is shown in figure 2-8(h). The membrane theory analysis of a single 
shell of this form was conducted in sections 4.4.1 and 6.3.4.1. 
First, consider the boundary conditions in the X direction. The great major-
ity of shell roofs of this configuration have been designed assuming simply 
supported boundaries: 
at X = 0 and X = L 
(9.91) 
If the support is a wall or frame in the Y-Z plane, it must be sufficiently stiff to 
prevent displacements in the Y or Z directions; yet, it must be sufficiently flexible 
to permit displacements along the X axis and rotations about the Y axis. 
Obviously, these requirements are difficult to satisfy exactly in a physical struc-
ture, but they are probably the best representation which can be incorporated 
into an elementary analytical solution. 
Now, consider the boundary conditions in the e direction. Referring to figure 
9-9(a), three situations are identified: exterior, interior-general, and interior-
symmetry line. In some cases, the resistance is augmented by stiffening beams 
spanning the length L; here, we will not consider this situation but only the 
basic shell. First, the exterior edge may be regarded as free, so that 
(9.92) 
The interior edges are somewhat more complicated to characterize, since they 
are continuous with the adjacent shell. Clearly, the displacements Dx, Do, and 
the rotation Dox must be compatible between the intersecting shells. Strict 
enforcement of this condition could result in four simultaneous equations per 
interior valley line, which greatly complicates the calculations. A simplification, 
widely used in design, is to treat every interior edge as if it were located

on a line of symmetry where the lateral displacement, Dy , and the rotation 
about the longitudinal axis, DlJx , vanish. For the coordinate system defined on 
figure 9-9(a), these conditions become 
(9.93a) 
for the interior edge of the outside barrel shell, and 
(9.93b) 
for all of the interior barrels, where from figure 9-9(a),

If YIJ = 0, the rotation DlJx is given in terms of Dn and DIJ from equations (9.2h): 
(9.93d) 
which is identical to equation (6.55) obtained for the membrane theory rotation. 
In addition, we may obtain two static conditions from the symmetry assump-
tion. First, the transverse shear stress resultants NlJx must be equal and opposite 
on any two coincident edges. When such edges lie along a symmetry line,

is the only possibility. Similarly, any resultant vertical force Fz on one edge

Equations (9.91)-(9.94) prescribe the boundary conditions for a simplified 
bending theory analysis of cylindrical shells, in which only two cases are 
considered-an exterior and a typical interior barrel. Further, the two cases 
are uncoupled, thus expeding the calculations. 
We first compare the expressions for the membrane theory stress resultants 
(derived in section 4.4.1) and the corresponding displacements (found in section 
6.3.4.1) against these boundary conditions. In particular, consider the case of a 
uniform dead load qd (force/area) represented by one term of a Fourier series, 
as given by equation (4.165b):

For clarity, all quantities computed from the membrane theory equations will 
be designated by the subscript m. We check the expressions for the stress 
resultants, equations (4. 169a-c), and find that the static boundary conditions in 
the X direction, Nx = Mx = 0 at X = 0 and L, are satisfied. An examination of 
the membrane theory displacements for this case, given by equations (6.56a-c), 
reveals that the kinematic boundary conditions in the X direction, Do = Dn = 0 
at X = 0 and L, are similarly satisfied. Thus, the only possible violation of 
the membrane theory conditions may occur on the () = ± ()k boundaries. 
Observe from figure 4-39 that the idealized membrane boundary must develop 
NOm and Sm at () = ± ()k' This is in clear conflict with the exterior edge condition, 
equation (9.92), where No and Nox, which corresponds to Sm, are required to 
vanish. An interior edge can develop only the Y component of NOm' FYm = 
Nom cos (), as shown on figure 9-9(a), leaving the Z component, Fzm = - NOm sin (), 
unbalanced. With respect to the Nox or Sm force, however, a careful examination 
of figure 4-39 reveals that the sense of Sm along two adjacent boundaries as 
computed from the membrane theory solution would be in the same direction, 
either in the ( +) or ( - ) X direction. On the other hand, two adjacent shells 
would be expected to develop equal and opposite shear resultants along their 
common boundary, since no resultant force along the X axis can exist. More-
over, if the interior valley is a symmetry line as assumed in developing equations 
(9.94a), then Nox must be equal to O. It is apparent, then, that the longitudinal 
boundary conditions implied for the development of the state of stress predicted 
by the membrane theory are grossly violated. 
The basic procedure to rectify these violations consists of starting with the 
computed membrane theory stress resultants, which are in equilibrium with the 
applied loading, and the corresponding displacements. Then, corrective edge 
loads are applied to satisfy the boundary conditions at () = ± ()k' Mathematically, 
this is equivalent to adopting the membrane theory solution as the particular 
solution to the governing equations. This has been shown quantitatively to be 
a sufficiently close approximation,20 which is hardly surprising in view of our 
previous discussions. 
With the membrane theory solution taken as the particular solution, we need 
consider only the homogeneous portion of Donnell's equation for the corrective 
edge loadings. Specifically, refer to the solutions given by equations (9.78), which 
were proposed for loading along edges e = constant. Notice that these expres-
sions are in the same Fourier series form as our membrane theory solution. 
This is, of course, no coincidence, but the very reason for taking the membrane 
theory solutions as Fourier series in the first place. As we have stated earlier, the 
displacements, stress resultants, and couples corresponding to equations (9.78) 
take the general form of equation (9.79). Now, we further assume that the semi-
infinite simplification is applicable, so that the effects at opposite boundaries 
() = ± ()k are uncoupled. This leaves only the first half of equation (9.79), with 
undetermined constants C~-C!. 
We first consider the exterior edge. The violation of the boundary conditions

stated in equation (9.92) are precisely equal to the membrane theory stress 
resultants evaluated at () = Ok. From equations (4. 169a-c),

(9.96) 
and 
(9.97) 
Next, from the semi-infinite form of equations (9.79), with k = 1, we select 
expressions for Nix, Ni, MJ, and QJ in terms of the four integration constants 
ct-Cl. Then, we enforce the free edge boundary conditions, equation (9.92), 
by setting 
No\ (~ , ()k) + Sm (~ , Ok) = 0 
Ni (~ , ()k) + NOm (~ , Ok) = 0 
MJ(~ ,Ok) = 0 
QJ (~ , ()k) = 0

(9.98b) 
(9.98c) 
(9.98d) 
after which ct-CJ are determined. Note that the functions of (X/L) [sin n(X/L)] 
or [cos n(X/L)] are the same for both the membrane theory and bending theory 
solutions, so that once the free edge condition is enforced at one point in the 
interval 0 :::;; X :::;; L, it is satisfied at every point. This is another advantage of 
the Fourier series representation. 
Once the constants of integration are determined for the exterior edge solution, 
the stress resultants and couples from the bending theory solution can be 
evaluated at a sufficient number of coordinates [(X/L), ()] to obtain the stress 
distribution. Of course, the membrane theory stress resultants are added to Nix, 
Ni, and Ni to get the complete expression for these functions. Finally, the total 
displacements may be computed as the sum of the membrane theory values, 
equations (6.56a-e), and those found from the bending solutions with the 
constants inserted. This solution is valid in the exterior portion of the shell 
«()k ;:::: () ;:::: 0). 
We have not provided sufficient detail here with respct to the bending 
solutions to perform calculations on actual shells, but detailed procedures 
and examples are available (see Design of Cylindrical Concrete Roofszl and 
BillingtonZZ).1t is often convenient to construct the bending theory corrections 
to the membrane theory solutions as linear combinations of unit load solutions

Stich solutions are tabulated for a wide range of shell parameters in Design of 
Cylindrical Concrete Roo/s.23 
We now take up the idealized interior edge, referring to the boundary 
conditions given by equations (9.93) and (9.94). We use an analogous procedure, 
superimposing the membrane theory solution with bending solutions for edge 
loadings. The constants of integration are evaluated from the conditions

DJx(~ ,Ok) + D(Jxm(~ ,Ok) = 0

where the bending components are taken from expressions of the form of 
equation (9.79), and the membrane theory parts are given by equations (6.56a-e) 
and (4. 169a-c). Also, Dy , and D(Jx are expressed in terms of D(J and Dn by 
equations (9.93c) and (9.93d), respectively, and Fz is stated in terms of Q(J and 
N(J by equation (9.94c). Again, these computations may be expedited by the use 
of the tables in Design of Cylindrical Concrete Roofs.24 
Finally, with respect to simply supported circular cylindrical shells without 
intermediate supports, we should assess the relevance of the rather complex 
analysis we have outlined. We made a start in this direction at the conclusion 
of section 4.4.1. Now we can amplify some of these remarks, since we have, in 
principle, satisfied the boundary conditions on all edges. 
Basically, at every cross section, the shell must resist the statical bending 
moment due to the applied loading, regardless of the theory used. For a uniform 
load w (force/length) the statical moment at the center line X = L/2 is the 
well-known

It is of interest to compare the magnitude and distribution ofthe stress resultant 
Nx over the cross section calculated by using the bending theory of shells to 
the like quantity found from elementary beam theory 
Mx Z 
NX=-I-
(9.102) 
where I = the moment of inertia of the cross section with unit thickness about 
the centroidal axis. This may be regarded as a gross measure of the relevance 
of the shell theory, as opposed to beam theory, calculations. In figure 9-9(b), 
we show the distribution of Nx over the cross section for a single barrel shell 
analyzed in Design of Cylindrical Concrete Roofs,25 along with the straight line 
distribution given by equation (9.102). Note that both the maximum tensile 
and compressive stress resultants are more than double the values computed 
from the linear strain, beam theory formula. It has been verified that both 
distributions of Nx yield practically the same statical moment Mx about the 
centroid of the cross section.26 Obviously, the analysis of an open cylindrical 
shell by elementary beam theory is grossly inaccurate, insofar as the elastic 
response is concerned. 
9.3 Shells of Revolution 
9.3.1 General: The bending of shells of revolution is a relatively complex 
subject from a mathematical standpoint. Also, the availability of very efficient 
and powerful numerically based computer programs has made many of the 
classical means of solving such problems somewhat archaic. Moreover, the 
classical solutions are developed in considerable detail in a number of popular 
monographs (Novozhilov,27 Fliigge,28 and Kraus29), and little would be ac-
complished here by restating these lengthy derivations. Instead, we explore 
only some of the important classical findings, and then present an energy 
formulation suitable for a finite element solution. 
9.3.2 Axisymmetrical Loading-Analytical Solutions 
9.3.2.1 Governing Equations. An early classical formulation of the shell bending 
problem was presented by H. Reissner (the father of E. Reissner), who studied 
the spherical shell.30 This "mixed" formulation, generalized by E. Meissner,31 
represents the fourth order system by a coupled set of two second order 
equations in terms of the meridional rotation D,,6 and the transverse shear 
resultant Q,,; here, the derivation is generalized to include specifically orthotropic 
materials. 
We begin by specializing the equilibrium equations, equations (3.24a, c, e), 
for the case of axisymmetric bending: 

414 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
(RoN",).", - R",cosr/lNe + RoQ", + q",R",Ro = 0

(RoM",).", -
R", cos r/lMe - R",RoQ", = 0 
(9.103a) 
(9.103b) 
(9.103c) 
We next combine the strain-displacement relationship for axisymmetric shells, 
equations (5.48a, c, d, g), and the constitutive law, equation (6.12), into a set of 
stress resultant and stress couple-displacement equations: 
N", = Dorll [~'" (DM + Dn)] 
+ Dorl2[~o (cosr/lD", + sinr/lDn)] -
N"'Tor 
Ne = Dorl2 [~'" (DM + Dn)] 
+ Dor22[~o (cosr/lD", + sinr/lDn)] -
NeTor 
Me = Dor45[~", D",e.",] + Dorss[c;/ D",e] -
M"'Tor 
(9.104a) 
(9.104b) 
(9.104c) 
(9.104d) 
Symmetry of the constitutive matrix is presumed, so that Dor12 = Dor21 and 
Dor45 = Dor54' Also, as before, the thermal terms are presumed to be known at 
the outset. 
The boundary conditions corresponding to the axisymmetric formulation 
are specialized from 1igure 6-3 as N", = fi", or D", = D",; Q", = Q", or Dn = Dn; and 
M", = M", or D",e = D",e' 
We now substitute equations (9.104c) and (9.104d) into equation (9.103c). 
To simplify the derivation here somewhat, the elements of the constitutive 
matrix [Dor] are taken as constant, but they can be generalized for shells with 
continuously varying material properties and/or thickness. 
Continuing, we have 
D",e.# + ~'" (~o) D",e.", 
o 
"'.'" 
(9.105) 
which is the first of two governing equations in D",e and Q",. 

9.3 Shells of Revolution 
415 
To obtain the second equation, we first consider equations (9.104a) and 
(9.104b). We form the combinations 
~[(9.104a) - Dor12 (9.104b)] 
Dor11 
Dor22 
and 
~[(9.104b) - Dor12 (9.104a)] 
Dor22 
Dor11 
and rewrite the expression (1/Ro)(cost/JD", + sin t/J Dn) as (1/Re)(cott/JD", + Dn) 
to get 
(9.106a) 
and 
where 
Dor12

Next, we eliminate Dn between equations (9.106a) and (9.106b) to find

(N", + N"'Tor)

(9.107a) 
(9.107b) 
We then eliminate D",.", from equations (9.107a) and (9.107b) by taking 
[(9.107b) - cot t/J (9.107a)]. The l.h.s. becomes 
(9.108) 
It is now convenient to suppress the transverse shearing strains. From 
equation (S.48g), note that for Y", = 0,

(9.109) 
so that -(1/R",) [l.h.s. (9.108)] = D",o, which is one of our dependent variables. 
To complete the derivation, the stress resultants N", and No on the r.h.s. of 
equation (9.107b) must be expressed in terms of the other variable Q",. This is 
most easily accomplished by using the overall equilibrium concept introduced 
in section 4.3.3.1. With Q", now included, equation (4.57) generalizes to 
(9.110) 
where Q(¢) is the resultant vertical load in the negative Z direction, expressed 
as a function of the surface loading by equation (4.59). Therefore, 
Q(¢) 
N", = 2 
. ¢ + Q", cot ¢ 
nRo SIll 
Now, considering equation (9.103b) in view of equation (9.111a),

No = R", sin ¢ [(RoQ",),,,, - RoN", + qnR",Ro]

Equations (9.111a) and (9.111b)may be used to remove N", and No from the r.h.s. 
of the combined equations (9.107a) and (9.107b), i,e., [(9.107b) - cot ¢ (9.107a)], 
which then becomes a second equation in D",o and Q",. This is tedious to carry 
through in the general form; consequently, at this point, the specialization for 
a commonly encountered case seems prudent. 
9.3.2.2 Homogeneous Solution for Spherical Shells. Consider an isotropic shell 
and no surface loading or thermal effects. Then, qn = Q(¢) = 0; J11 = J12 = J1; 
Dorll = Dor22 = Eh/(1 -
J12); Dor44 = Dor55 = D; and Dor45 = J1D, where D has 
been previously defined as Eh3/[12(1 -
J12)]. Also, for the spherical geometry, 
R", = Ro = a and Ro = a sin fjJ. We may anticipate that the forthcoming solution 
will represent the influence of edge forces and moments which, in combination 
with a membrane theory solution for the surface loading, constitutes a complete 
solution to the spherical shell problem. 
Now, we proceed with the aforementioned ([9.107b] - cot ¢ [9.107a]) com-
bination, which, in view of equation (9.109), gives 
1 
D",o = Eh [(1 + J1) cot fjJ(N", - No) -
No.", + J1N",.",] 
Equations (9.111a) and (9.111b) simplify to

where we have employed the Gauss-Codazzi relationship Ro.; = R; cos ,p via

(9.115) 
(9. 116a)

respectively,

a2Eh 
LL(Q;) -
Jl2Q; = ---VQ; 
(9. 117a) 
(9. 117b) 
so that the equations are uncoupled. When one variable is determined, the other 
may be immediately found from equations (9. 116a) and (9.116b), and all other 
terms follow from the previous formulae. 
It is of interest to rewrite equation (9. 117b) in the form 
LL(Q;) + 4k4Q; = 0 
where 
(9. 118a) 
(9. 118b) 
The resulting equation (9.118a) is quite similar to equation (9. 16a), which 
describes cylindrical shells. Here, of course, the operator L( ) causes more 
complication in the eventual solution. 
It is also convenient to express equation (9.118a) in complex form as 33 

418 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
L[L(QI,b) + 2ik2QI,bJ - 2ik2[L(QI,b) + 2ik2QI,bJ = 0 
L[L(QI,b) - 2ieQI,bJ + 2ik2[L(QI,b) - 2ik2QI,bJ = 0 
which can be easily verified to be equivalent to the original equation. 
Thus, the solution of the two second order equations: 
L(QI,b) + 2ik2QI,b = 0 
L(QI,b) - 2ik2QI,b = 0 
will constitute the solution to the fourth order equation (9.118a). 
(9. 119a) 
(9. 119b) 
(9. 120a) 
(9. 120b) 
The formulation of the governing equations for other geometries follows 
similar, but sometimes more complicated, steps. The interested reader is referred 
to Novozhilov,34 Fliigge,35 and Kraus.36 
An exact solution to the governing equations for the spherical geometry 
exists. If one of the equations, e.g., equation (9. 120a), is fully expanded, we have 
QI,b.# + cot rp QI,b.1,b - cot2 rp QI,b + 2ik2QI,b = 0 
(9.121) 
which is a second order linear differential equation with variable coefficients. 
The further transformations 
(9. 122a) 
and 
QI,b = QI,b sin rp 
(9. 122b) 
put the equation into the form 
-

QI,b,1/t1/t + 21/1(1 -
1/1) QI,b,,,, - 41/1(1 _ 1/1) QI,b = 0 
(9.123) 
which is known as the hypergeometric equation. Such equations may be solved 
with some rather slowly converging power series expressions.3 7 
9.3.2.3 Asymptotic Solutions for Spherical Shells. One of the most powerful 
methods for solving the complicated differential equations that arise in the 
bending theory of shells is that of asymptotic integration. This method is 
developed in Kraus38 and Novozhilov39 and applied to both symmetrically 
and asymmetrically loaded shells of revolution in the latter reference. A detailed 
development is beyond our objectives in this book. It is sufficient to mention 
here that the asymptotic integration technique, as applied to second order 
equations such as equation (9.121), transforms the equation into a form in which 
the first derivative of the dependent variable is eliminated. 
The attractiveness of solving the bending theory equations for rotational 
shells in a relatively simple way has given rise to some useful approximate 
methods, in which it is postulated that the solutions to the homogeneous 
equations have the form 

9.3 Shells of Revolution 
e±k¢ sin k¢ } 
e±k¢cos k¢ 
419 
(9.124) 
Although expressions of this type can be rigorously derived using asymptotic 
integration, such solutions may be obtained directly by simply neglecting certain 
terms in the original differential equation. This is applicable for shells in which 
certain geometric parameters remain essentially constant over a significant 
portion of the shell. For example, note in equation (9.121) that the second 
and third terms are multiplied by cot ¢ and cot2 ¢, which are relatively small 
when ¢ z n/4, whereas the fourth term has a coefficient of k 2 , which, from 
equation (9.118b), is proportional to a/h. Thus, it is reasonable to use the 
simplified equation 
(9.125) 
to find approximate solutions for the bending of spherical shells under edge 
loads. If we are interested in solutions in the vicinity of the lower boundary of 
spherical shells due to edge loading, as shown in figure 9-10, it is only necessary 
that ¢b not be too small. This reasoning is also applicable for other shells with 
smoothly varying geometry, such as conical shells, and is sometimes referred 
to as the Geckeler approximation.40 Despite the lack of mathematical rigor, 
such "quick and dirty" solutions are often the only relatively simple analytical 
means available to check complex, computer-based analyses. 
We may write the solution of equation (9.125) from the auxiliary equations 
(9.126) 
Fig.9-1O Edge-Loaded Spherical Shell 

420 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
which give 
m = ±(1 ± i)k 
(9.127) 
so that the complete solution is 
Q</> = B1e(1+i)k</> + B2e(1-i)k</> + B3e-(1+i)k</> + B4e-(1-i)k</> 
(9.128) 
where Bl - B4 are integration constants. 
We now wish to redefine the integration constants so that Q</> is expressed 
in terms of real functions. First, we use the identities 
e~k</> = cos k¢J + i sin k¢J} 
e-·k</> = cos k¢J -
i sin k</J 
to rewrite equation (9.128) as 
Q</> = (Bl + B2)ek</> cos k</J + i(Bl - B2)ek</> sin k¢J 
(9.129) 
It is convenient to express this solution as a function ofthe auxiliary coordinate 
(9. 130b) 
which we show on figure 9-10 and introduce into the first term of equation 
(9. 130a): 
(Bl + B2)ek</> cos k¢J = (Bl + B2)ek(</>b-ih cos k(¢Jb -
¢) 
= (Bl + B2)ek</>be-k¢(cos k¢Jb cos k¢) 
+ sin k¢Jb sin k¢) 
= [(Bl + B2 )ek</>bcos k¢JbJ e-k¢ cos k¢) 
+ [(Bl + B2)ek</>b sin k,p"J e-k¢ sin k¢) 
Similarly, the second term becomes 
i(Bl -
B2)ek</> sin k¢J = [i(Bl - B2)ek</>b sin k¢JbJ e-k¢ cos k¢Jb 
- [i(Bl - B2)ek</>b cos k¢JbJe-k¢ sin k¢) 
(9.l30c) 
(9. 130d) 
The terms in [ J in the preceding equations may be collected as coefficients 
of the variable terms e-k¢ cos k¢) and e-k¢ sin k¢), and can be redefined as new 
arbitrary constants C1 and C2 • We retain the last two expressions in equation 
(9. 130a) in terms of ¢J, with (B3 + B4) and -i(B3 -
B4) redefined as C3 and C4, 
respectively, so that the revised form of the solution is 
Q</> = e-k¢(C1COsk~ + C2 sink¢) + e-k</>(C3 cos k¢J + C4 sin k¢J) 
(9.131) 
Equation (9.131) is identical in form to equation (9.20), if¢) is replaced by </Jb -
</J 
and the constants are redefined. This comparison gives rise to the physical 
interpretation of the Geckeler approximation as the replacement of the actual 
shell by a cylindrical shell of suitable dimensions. 

9.3 Shells of Revolution 
421 
The foregoing transformation is an alternate means of introducing the semi-
infinite concept that we utilized extensively for cylindrical shells. The solution 
is uncoupled into parts that decay from the boundaries ¢J = ¢Jb and ¢J = ¢Jt, 
respectively. If the influence of the loading at one boundary does not penetrate 
into the region of the shell affected by the loading at the other boundary, we 
have a semi-infinite shell. Considering edge loading originating at ¢J = ¢Jb' we 
retain 
(9.132) 
We now evaluate the corresponding stress resultants, couples, and displace-
ments. In performing the required differentiations, take care to note that 
( ).91 = -( ),.~ 
From equation (9.111a), with Q(¢J) = 0, 
N9I(¢J) = Q9I cot ¢J 
= e-k¢ cot ¢J(C1 cos k(j) + C2 sin k(j)) 
N9I((j)) = e-k¢ cot(¢Jb - (j))(C1 cos k(j) + C2 sin k(j)) 
Expanding equation (9.103b) with qn = 0, we have 
a(sin ¢J Q9I).9I - a sin ¢J Nq, - a sin ¢J No = ° 
Solving for No, after replacing Nq, with equation (9. 134a), we find 
No((j)) = QM 
= - Q9I.¢ 
= (C1 -
C2 )ke-k¢cosk(j) + (C1 + C2 )ke-k¢sink(j)

(9. 134a) 
(9. 134b) 
(9. 134c) 
(9. 135a) 
(9.135b) 
Next, we turn to the rotation Dq,o, which is expressed by equation (9.116a). It is 
consistent with our previous approximations to take L( ) ~ ( ).q,q, and also to 
neglect the IlQ9I term, whereby 
-
1 
D9Io(¢J) = - Eh QMq, 
1 
= - Eh Q9I.¢¢ 
(9.136) 
The actual displacements are sometimes of interest. Dq, and Dn may be individually 
found from the simultaneous solution of equations (6.34a) and (6.34b). Of more 
use for our purposes is the radial displacement DR, which is defined in the inset 
of figure 9-10 as 
(9.137a) 

422

Referring to equation (6.34b) with Ro(¢) = a sin ¢) = ii, 
-
ii 
DR(</J) = iiBo = Eh (No -
/1N",) 
(9. 137b) 
which is easily evaluated from equations (9.134c) and (9.135b). 
We now turn to the stress couples, which can be obtained from equations 
(9.104c) and (9.104d). Again, it is consistent with our previous arguments to 
neglect the second terms in these equations in comparison to the first, whereby 
D 
M", = --;;D",o,,,, 
(9. 138a) 
which is conveniently written, using equations (9.136) and (9.118b) with /12 
neglected, as 
a 
a 
M", = - 4k4 Qt/J,t/J",,,, = 4e Q"',iii 
(9. 138b) 
which gives 
M",(¢) = ;ke-ki[(Cl + C2)cosk¢) - (C1 -
C2 ) sin k¢)J 
Also, from equation (9.104d) with Dor45 = /1, and (9. 138a) 
Mo(¢) = /1M",(f/J) 
(9. 138c) 
(9.139) 
We have thus derived approximate, but explicit, expressions for the forces, 
moments, and displacements in an edge-loaded spherical shell. From these 
equations, it is obvious that the assumption leading to equation (9.125)-the 
neglect of Q", and Q""", as compared to Q""",,,,-is reasonable since each sub-
sequent differentiation gives a factor k that is of o (a/h). Moreover, the presence 
of the cot </J and coe </J coefficients of Q""", and Q"" respectively, in equation 
(9.121) further reduces the influence of the latter terms when </J > rc/4. The limits 
of application of the semi-infinite solution can be established using figure 9-2, 
with kX replaced by k</J where k is given by equation (9.118b). 
For practical application, it is helpful to represent the previous solution in 
the same format as we used for the edge-loaded cylindrical shell. Consider the 
loading shown in figure 9-10, which is analogous to figure 9-1 for the cylindrical 
shell. We take 
Mo = M",(</Jb) 
Qo = Q",(t/J,,)

9.3.2.4 Compound Shells. We are now able to resume our consideration of the 
cylindrical shell with a spherical head, as shown in figure 4-14 and discussed 
in section 4.3.4. Previously, we found that the membrane theory, by itself, was 
inadequate, since (a) radial deformations between the two shells were incom-
patible; and, (b) except for the complete hemisphere, the radial component of 
the meridional force in the spherical shell was unbalanced. We may now fully 
analyze the shell by the flexibility method described in section 6.3.1, using the 
notation introduced in equation (6.30). 
On figure 9-11(a), we show the pressurized shell from figure 4-14, with the 
axial coordinate taken as X, and the origin placed at the end of the cylinder. 
The respective thicknesses of the spherical and cylindrical segments are defined 
as hI and h2' and the Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios as El and E2 and 
fl.l and fl.2· Note that sintfrl = a2la l · 
Loading case [9.11(b)] requires the membrane theory solutions for the cylin-
drical and the spherical shells, given in equations (4.74)-(4.76) and equations 
(6.38a-e), as well as a bending solution for the cylindrical shell, given by 
equations (9.21)-(9.29) and matrix 9-1, with Qo = p(ad2) cos tfrl and Mo = O. 
As we have noted previously, the membrane theory solution for the internal 
pressure loading gives incompatibilities for both the relative radial displace-
ment [figure 9-11(d)] and the relative meridional rotation [figure 9-11(e}] of 
the spherical and cylindrical shells at their junction. We denote these quantities 
in the original shell, case [9-11(a)], as Lll and Ll2' and in case [9-11(b)] as ~1 
and ~2' There is no contribution to ~2 from the membrane theory solutions 
for either segment, since, under the uniform internal pressure loading, each shell 
deforms without any rotation of the meridian. This is easily visualized. How-
ever, there still remains a contribution of ~2 from the line load p(ad2) cos tfrl' 
To restore the compatibility, we provide loading case [9-11(c)], consisting 
of the static correspondents of Lll and Ll2-namely, a radial transverse shear 
force Xl and a meridional moment X2' equal and opposite on each segment. 
Solutions for these loading systems are given for the cylindrical shell by equa-
tions (9.22)-(9.29) and matrix 9-1 with Qo = Xl and Mo = X2' where the signs 
are established in accordance with figure 9-1; and for the spherical shell by 
equations (9.132)-(9.142) with Qo = Xl sin tfr, and Mo = X2' where the signs are 
established in accordance with figure 3-6. For the flexibility formulation that 
we are following, it is expedient to solve the following loading cases: (i) Qo = 1,

Mo = 0 on the cylindrical shell, and Qo = sin tPl' Mo = 0 on the spherical shell; 
and, (ii) Qo = 0, Mo = 1 on the cylindrical shell, and Qo = 0, Mo = 1 on the 
spherical shell. For case (i), the relative radial displacement and rotation are 
designated as Fll and F21 ; whereas, for case (ii), the corresponding quantities 
are labeled F12 and F22 • 
We now consider the details of the evaluation of the individual terms in

(9.143) 
First, note that we are dealing with relative displacements and rotations, 
which are computed from the absolute displacements of the two segments of 
the shell. Therefore, we must carefully define the sign convention for these 
quantities. Corresponding to the senses assumed for the redundants Xl and X2 
in figure 9-11(c), it is consistent to take the positive sense of the relative radial 
displacement as increasing, i.e., inward on the cylinder (del) and outward on 
the sphere (d.d. Similarly, a positive relative meridional rotation will open 
the internal angle between the cylinder (de2 ) and the sphere (d.2 ), originally 
n/2 + rPl' These are illustrated on figure 9-1l(d) and (e). For example, if we 
compute the radial displacement in the cylinder Dn due to one of the loading 
cases, and it is positive (outward) by the cylindrical shell convention, it takes 
a negative sign in the relative displacement expression, since it is opposite to 
in sense to del' On the other hand, a positive computed value for the radial 
displacement of the spherical shell DR is consistent with dsl , so that it has a 
positive sign in the relative displacement expression. Similarly, a positive me-
ridional rotation DX/J in the cylindrical shell may be seen from figure 5-2(a) (with 
0( = X and fJ = 0) to be opposite in sense to de2 , so that it gets a negative sign. 
The rotation of the spherical shell is established from figure 5-2(a) (with 0( = rP 
and fJ = 0), where a positive meridional rotation DI/J/J(rP), corresponds to a 
positive d.2 • 
Next, note that the compatibility condition requires that the relative radial 
displacement and relative meridional rotation between the two segments van-
ishes, or 
(9.144) 
For the evaluation of the elements of {X} and [F], we refer to the chart of 
basic solutions given in table 9-1. Note that the cylindrical and spherical 
segments may each have different constant thicknesses and material properties. 
In the last column, the most probable algebraic sign of the computed displace-
ment or rotation on the shell segment is assumed, and the corresponding 
algebraic sign of the contribution of this quantity to the relative displacement 
is given. 
First we calculate the displacements with the continuity constraints relaxed, 
Xl and X2 • 
For the cylindrical shell, we compute the normal displacement du~ to the 
internal pressure from equation (9.42a) with Nx == p(ad2) sin rPl and N/J = pa2 as 
Dn(O) = p E:~2 (a2 -Ial sin rPl) = p E:t (1 - I) 
(9.145a) 
which is a negative contribution to Xl'

Finally, we have the contributions to the flexibility influence coefficients from 
the unit actions on the spherical shell. 
Solving for DR with Qo = sin £P1 and Mo = 0, we find C1 = sin £P1 and C2 = 
-sin£P1 from equations (9.142). Then, from equations (9. 134c) and (9. 135b), we 
evaluate NtP(O) = cos £P1 and Ne(O) = 2k1 sin £P1' which are inserted into equation

If the materials and/or the thicknesses for the two shells are the same, the 
equations can be further simplified. 
Once all of the terms are evaluated, 
(9.150) 
in view of equation (9.144). After determining Xl and X2' the stress resultants, 
couples, and displacements in the cylindrical and spherical segments are found 
as linear combinations of the solutions for the loading cases shown in figure 
9-11(b) and (c). 
We shall not pursue further details of the calculations here, but refer to 
a numerical study in Fliigge.41 There, two cases are considered, a hemispherical 
head and a shallower cap with ¢J1 = 45°. For both cases, h1 = h2 = h, h/a = 0.01, 

9.3 Shells of Revolution

Fig.9-12(a-b) Stress Resultants and Moments in Compound Shells 
and J1 = 0.3. On figures 9-12(a) and (b), comparative values of the meridional 
stress couple, Mx or Mt/>, and the circumferential or hoop stress resultant, No, 
are shown for the two examples. 
The meridional moments increase greatly for the discontinuous case. Simi-
larly, for the circumferential stress resultant, the hemispherical head provides 
a smooth transition for the hoop stresses in the two segments; the shallow 
cap results in an increased magnitude of No as well as a change in sense to 
compression, which gives rise to the possibility of circumferential buckling or 
wrinkling. An independent calculation42 gave a maximum No = -7.8pa for 
the shallow cap. 
Although the hemispherical head might seem more attractive on the basis of 
this comparison, the fabrication advantages of shallow caps have been pointed 
out previously, and the practical solution is often to include a circumferential 
ring stiffener, as we see in figure 2-8(r). Details regarding the design of such 
stiffeners and other practical considerations are found in Pirok and Wozniak. 43 
When an elastic stiffener is used, it is possible to generalize the model to include 
the stiffener, following the same reasoning we employed in section 9.2.2.7. 
A comprehensive study of ring-stiffened cylindrical-conical shells under hydro-
static loading was performed by the author and his co-workers, and the results 
are reported in Gould et al.44 and Wang and Gould.45 In general, an adequate 
circumferential stiffener greatly moderates the extreme amplifications caused 
by a geometric discontinuity.44 
Another possibility for reducing the stress amplification due to a geometric 
discontinuity is the use of a transition segment, such as a torospherical head, 
discussed in section 4.3.4.2 and illustrated in figures 4-16(b) and 4-17. Ranjan

Fig.9-12(c) Circumferential Stress on Middle Surface of Torospherical Head 
and Steele46 have examined the range of applicability of approximate analytical 
solutions derived from asymptotic expansions of the dependent variables to 
the solution of torospherical shells. From their study, one can draw some 
conclusions as to the optimum radius of the toroidal knuckle as a function of 
the cylindrical and spherical radii and the shell thickness. Also, their study 
suggests a lower bound approximation for the critical internal pressure corre-
sponding to circumferential wrinkling. Although they obtain fairly accurate 

9.3 Shells of Revolution 
433 
solutions with their analytical formulae, based on comparisons with numerical 
and experimental results, it would appear that the best present technology for 
an actual design case would include a finite element analysis using doubly 
curved rotational shell elements. 
The finite element approach is introduced in section 9.3.4 and is widely 
documented in the technical literature. Results from such an analysis ofthe shell 
treated in section 4.3.4.2 are shown in figure 9-12(c), where the smoothing of 
the peak membrane theory stresses is apparent. Further results for this shell, 
such as displacements and stress couples, are also available.47 
9.3.3 Asymmetrical Loading-Analytical Solutions: When the loading on a 
shell of revolution is not axisymmetric, the Fourier series technique that we 
employed extensively in chapter 4 is again useful to separate the independent 
variables. The problem then reduces to the solution of a set of ordinary differential 
equations for each harmonic j. 
General solutions for spherical and conical shells are given by Fliigge.48 
These solutions are based on the classical displacement method and are exact 
in the sense that only quantities of O(h2/R2): 1 are neglected. These solutions 
are of value in studying such cases as static wind loading and discrete column 
supports, which we discussed in sections 4.3.6.2 and 4.3.7.3., respectively. 
For geometries other than spherical and conical and, of course, cylindrical 
(which we have treated separately), exact solutions are scarce. 
As a general approach, the formulation of Novozhilov49 is very attractive. 
He follows the classical force method rather than the displacement procedure 
that we have employed almost exclusively in our study of plate bending in 
chapter 8 and of cylindrical shells in this chapter. We did use a force formulation 
for the membrane theory in chapter 4, but this involved only the equilibrium 
equations, since that problem is statically determinate. In the bending theory, 
however, the situation is more complicated, and it is necessary to express the 
strain-displacement or compatibility equations, (5.52) and (5.53), in terms of 
the stress resultants and couples. Once this is accomplished via the constitutive 
law, the resulting expressions are combined with the equilibrium relations to 
provide a consistent set of equations in which the stress resultants and couples 
are the unknowns. In this context, it is of interest to note that the H. Reissner-
Meissner approach presented in section 9.3.2.1 is a combination of a force and 
a displacement formulation, since the dependent variables are Qt/J and Dt/J8' This 
is often termed a mixed formulation. 
We may also point out an interesting feature of the Novozhilov formulation 
of the shell bending problem, whereby the dependent variables are grouped 
into complex variables. This results in a halving of the order of the eventual set 
of equations to be solved and thereby simplifies the algebra. The solution of 
the ensuing equations is accomplished by the asymptotic integration technique, 
to which we have alluded previously. Novozhilov's solution is applicable for 
surface loading which is described by the first two harmonics, j = 0 and j = 1. 

434 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
Moreover, shells with a special form of the meridian, i.e., (l/Rq, -
1/Ro)csc2 rP = 
constant, can be solved for the general harmonic loadingj > 1, which suggests 
a substitute curve approximation for other meridional profiles. Beyond this, 
it is generally necessary to neglect terms of O[P(h/R)] to achieve a solution; 
thus, for higher harmonics, the accuracy diminishes. However, a large number 
of practical problems can be described rather closely in terms of the lower 
harmonic load components-such as the wind loading shown on figure 4-34-
so that the Novozhilov method has wide applicability. The author has extended 
this approach to include cases in which terms of o [P(h/R)] may be significant, 
such as in the column-supported shell problem discussed in section 4.3.7.3. 50 
It is felt, however, that currently the most feasible approach to the general 
solution of shells of revolution under asymmetrical as well as symmetrical 
loading is to use an energy-based numerical solution. We develop the required 
energy expressions for shells of revolution in the next section. 
9.3.4 Energy Formulation 
9.3.4.1 General Considerations. The total potential energy functional Ut defined 
in section 7.4.2 is specialized here for a shell of revolution. It is convenient to 
consider an arbitrary segment of a shell bound by two parallel circles defined 
by the meridional angles rPi and rPi+l' as shown in figure 9-13. Here, the Z axis 
is oriented so that Z = 0 corresponds to the upper boundary of the shell. This 
segment may be a portion of a shell or even an entire shell. Also, rP; may be 0°, 
which indicates a closed shell or dome. It is evident that the total potential 
energy for a shell composed of the assemblage of a number of such segments 
is the sum of the energies of all the segments. Therefore, the development, for 
the most part, may focus on a single general segment, such as that shown in 
figure 9-13. Of course, the segments adjoining external boundaries require some 
specialization to accommodate prescribed boundary conditions. We also should 
remember that the stationary condition, stated previously as equation (7.14), 
bUt = 0 
(9.151) 
implies a global extremum and should be applied to the entire assembled shell. 
Nevertheless, the numerical techniques generally applied to this problem permit 
almost all of the calculations to be performed at the segment or local, as 
opposed to the global level. 
9.3.4.2 Geometry. Recall from section 2.8.2 that three possibilities were presented 
for the meridional coordinate: the meridional angle rP, the axial coordinate Z, 
and the meridional arc length sq,. In fact, the various computations that are 
required in an actual problem sometimes involve functions of two, or even all 
three of these possibilities. For this topic, it is convenient to use the R-Z 
Cartesian coordinates to locate stations on the shell, but to take the arc length 
as the primary dependent variable. It is convenient to define for each segment

9.3.4.3 Fourier Series Representation. As is customary for shells of revolution, 
all external loading, stress resultants and couples, strains and changes in curva-
ture, and displacements and rotations are represented by Fourier series in the 
circumferential variable (). These expressions are given as equations (4.86a) and 
(4.86b) for the loading and in-plane stress resultants; by equations (5.50) for the 
strains and changes in curvature; and by equations (5.51) for the displacements 
and rotations. To make our discussion complete, we write the corresponding 
expressions for the bending stress resultants and couples: 
Q,p 
Q~cosj() 
Q/I 
00 
Q~sinj() 
M,p 
L 
M*cosj() 
(9.154) 
M/I 
i=O 
M~cosj() 
M,p/l 
M*esinj() 
We may then further restrict our development to typical harmonic j of 
segment i, for which the stress resultants and couples and the strains and 
changes in curvature are represented by vectors {Ni} and {.:i}, respectively, as 
defined in matrix 6-2 and equation (6.10). Typical elements of these vectors are 
NJ cosj(), wi sinj(), etc. Also, we have the displacement vector {Ai}, defined in 
accordance with equation (5.51), as 
{AI} = {D* cosj() D~ sinj() D~ cosj() D*o cosj() D~,p sinj()} 
(9.155) 
9.3.4.4 Strain-Displacement Relationships. If we anticipate a displacement for-
mulation, we will have need for the strains and changes in curvature expressed 
as functions of the displacements and rotations. We derived such compatibility 
relationships for harmonicj as equations (5.52) and (5.53). We may transform 
these equations to the nondimensional arc length variable s by noting, from 
figure 9-13, that 
R,pd¢ = ds,p = Lids 
(9.156a) 
from which we may express

The resulting relations are conveniently written in the matrix form 
(9.158) 
where [B{] is given by matrix 9-3. 
Note that [B{J is an operator matrix and must always premultiply {AI}. 
Modified expressions for K~, K~, and oj, with transverse shearing strains 
suppressed, are easily written, but are not particularly advantageous in the 
formulation. 
We also require a modification of the strain-displacement relationships if 
a closed shell is encountered. We have shown two cases in figure 4-1 and have 
recorded the pole condition for both possibilities in table 6-1. Here, the origin 
for the coordinate system is generally selected so that s = 0 when Ro = O. 
To establish the pole conditions and to modify the strain-displacement 
relationships suitably, we simply postulate that all strains and changes in 

438 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
curvature remain finite as s --+ 0. Consider, for example, the expression for f,~, 
which we write from equation (9.158) and matrix 9-3, row (2), as

For both shells shown in figure 4-1, Ro(O) = 0, so that for the first term to remain 
finite as s --+ 0, (cos <P D~)s=o = 0, which creates an indeterminate form. The 
second term will remain finite only if (jD~)s=o = 0, and the third term requires 
that (sin <p D~)s=o = 0. Hence, we have the general pole condition 
(cos<pD~ + jD~ + sinq)DDs=o = ° 
(9.160) 
for which we may investigate the individual pole conditions. We have six 
separate possibilities to study, consisting of two types of closed shells, (<p)s=o = ° 
and (<p)s=o = <Pt, for j = 0, j = 1, and j > 1. It is easiest to treat the harmonics 
individually. 
j = 0: For this case, equation (9.160) reduces to 
(cos<pD3 + sinq)D~)s=o = ° 
(9.161a) 
If (<p)s=o = 0, the second term drops out, so that no restriction is needed on D~; 
whereas if (<p)s=o = <Pt> 
D3(0) = ° 
(9.161b) 
as recorded in the second line, second column, of table 6-1. Also, for the latter 
case, equation (9.161a) gives 
D3(0) = - tan <ptD~(O) 
as listed in the second line, third column, of table 6-1. 
j = 1: Here, equation (9.160) becomes 
(cos<pDJ + DJ + sinq)D;)s=o = 0 
If (<p)s=o = 0, 
DJ(O) + DJ(O) = 0 
(9.161c) 
(9.162a) 
(9. 162b) 
as recorded in the third line, second column, oft able 6-1. Note that D;(O) = 0 
is also listed in the table. This arises out of consideration of YfJ and is not required 
here-but neither is it contradicted. Now, if (<p)s=o = <Pt, we have 
(9.163a) 
Examining the corresponding entry in row 3, column 3, of table 6-1, we find 
(9.1 63b) 
which obviously cannot be completely obtained from equation (9.163a). How-
ever, equation (9.163b) does satisfy equation (9.163a), so that no contradiction 
is encountered. 

9.3 Shells of Revolution

j > 1: In this case, 
D~(O) = D~(O) = D~(O) = 0 
(9.164) 
as listed in line 4 of table 6-1 for both types of closed shells, obviously satisfies 
equation (9.160), but, as before, consideration of some of the other individual 
relationships is required to certify the correctness of these conditions. 
Proceeding with similar arguments for the other strains that have singularities 
at Z = O-i.e., wi, K~, ri, and yJ-the remaining entries in table 6-1 may be 
verified. 
Having isolated the necessary constraints on the displacements to avoid sin-
gularities, we now turn to the actual modified strain-displacement relationships. 
We again use e~ as given by equation (9.159) to illustrate the approach. In view 
of equation (9.160), equation (9.159) evaluated at s = 0 becomes

which is an indeterminate form. Using L'Hospital's rule, we may investigate the

to s using equation (9.157). Proceeding, we have

In practice, when a dome is modeled by multiple segments, equation (9.167) is 
used for e~(s) in the uppermost segment where i = O. 
To make this discussion complete, we present the entire set of modified 
strain-displacement equations for a dome: 51 
(9.168) 
where rows 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 (corresponding to eo, w, Kr/J' r, and Ye) of [BiJ are 
replaced by the modified equations, such as equation (9.167), as depicted in 
matrix 9-4. 
Additionally, there are circumstances in which the pole cannot conveniently 
be located at s = 0, but coincides with s = L i . For example, a shell which is 
closed at both ends will present such a situation at one end unless complete

loading and geometric symmetry are present, whereupon only half the shell 
must be considered. Similar modified strain-displacement equations may be 
developed by enforcing the finite strain conditions at s = L; instead of s = O. 
An analogous set of equations can be developed for the case shown in 
figure 4-1(b) where rP = rPt· 
Thus, we have the strain-displacement relationships given as a function of 
the nondimensional arc length variable s by matrix 9-3 and equation (9.158), 
augmented by special equations for pole segments, matrix 9-4 and equation 
(9.168.) 
9.3.4.5 Total Potential Energy Functional. U<, as defined by equation (7.14), is 
the sum of U., the strain energy, and Uq , the potential energy of the applied 
loads. 
First, considering the strain energy U., as given by equation (7.4), we may 
integrate through the thickness to obtain the strain energy for segment i in 
harmonicj:

We proceed with the displacement formulation, generalizing for specifically 
orthotropic shells, by replacing LNi J using equation (6.12): 
Vii = ~ Sal f~" [[DorJ{Ei} - {NTor}Y{Ei}dAi 
(9.170a) 
= ~ Sal f~" ({Ei)T[DorJ{Ei} -
LNTorJ {Ei})dAi 
(9. 170b) 
noting that [Dor] is symmetric. Finally, we replace the strains by the displace-
ments using matrix 9-3 and equation (9.158), and get

(9.171) 
Now, we turn to the potential energy of the applied loads Vq , as defined in 
equations (7.10). Of the three terms contained in the general expression, equa-
tion (7.10a), which accommodate distributed, line, and concentrated loadings, 
only the first term and the second integral of the second term are pertinent here. 
Using Fourier series, line loads along the Sa or st/J coordinate line, as represented 
by the first integral in the second term, may be included in the first term, and 
any concentrated loads, as represented by the third term, may be included in 
the second integral of the second term. Therefore, in terms of the present 
notation, 
Vji = - Sal f~" LA{J {q{} dAi -
f~" LA{(Z;)J {t}{(Z;)} R(Zi) d8 
-f~" LA{(Zi+1)J {t}{(Zi+1)}R(Zi+d d8 
(9.172) 
where {q{} {Ai(Z;)}, and {t}{(Zi)} are defined corresponding to equation (7.10a). 
Note that in a numerical calculation, the second and the third terms of 
equation (9.172) would both not ordinarily appear. The second term might be 
included with segment i -
1, or the third with segment i + 1, depending on the 
computational order. 
For the entire shell, 
p 
V/ = L (Vi; + vj;)

where the shell is assumed to be composed of p segments. The principle of mini-
mum total potential energy [Equation (7.14)] gives the equilibrium condition 
{)V/ = 0 
(9.174)

9 Shell Bending and Instability 
For asymmetric loading, the complete solution is composed of the super-
position of the solutions to equation (9.174) for the relevant participating 
harmonics. 
9.3.4.6 Rayleigh-Ritz Solution. The Rayleigh-Ritz method was presented in 
section 7.4.3 as a promising numerical approach to the solution of equations 
such as equation (9.174). In the context of the present development for a single 
general harmonic j, the vector {A}, as introduced in equation (7.15), is the 
assemblage of the vectors {An for all of the segments comprising the shell. 
Recall that {An was defined in equation (9.155) as the vector of displacements 
for segment i. The index m introduced in equation (7.15) is equal to 5 in this 
case, since there are five displacement components in {Ai}, except for thej = 0 
case when De and Detfo = 0 and m is reduced to 3. But, for the general case, there 
will be five comparison or trial functions of the form of equation (7.16) for each 
of the p segments of the shell. Polynomials of the form 
(~ = 1,5) 
1= 1,p 
(9.175) 
where A{l = D~, A{2 = Dj, A{3 = D~, A{4 = D~e, and Ai5 = Djtfo are quite popular 
for this application. It is important to note that n, the order of the approxima-
tion for each A{k' may vary for each displacement k, segment i, and harmonic j. 
Upon substitution of the set of 5p comparison functions of the form of 
equation (9.175) for {An into equations (9.171) and (9.172), and the operation 
by [B{] on the polynomials, the extremum problem represented by equation 
(9.174), is transformed into the maximum-minimum problem of the calculus 
(
I = o,n) 
k = 1,5 
i = 1,p 
(9.176) 
The maximum-minimum conditions, equation (9.176), are necessary, but 
not sufficient, to determine the n coefficients (elk') that are present for each of 
the five comparison functions A{k in each segment i = 1, p. In addition to 
equation (9.176), there are intersegment continuity conditions, which recognize 
that the displacements are continuous along the common boundary of adjacent 
segments. Also, kinematic boundary conditions which fix the values of the corre-
sponding displacements may be prescribed on the external boundaries. Thus, 
in summary, the maximum-minimum conditions, the intersegment continuity 
conditions, and the kinematic boundary conditions comprise the necessary 
and sufficient conditions to satisfy the principle of minimum total potential 
energy approximately. The further development ofthis approach is beyond our 
objectives here and is left to the province of the finite element method. 52 
One further point should be noted, however. Static boundary conditions are 
also encountered. These enter as the natural boundary conditions of the varia-

9.4 Shells of Translation 
443 
tional problem; this means, essentially, that if the kinematic correspondent of 
a certain force or moment is not prescribed on the boundary, that force or 
moment will take the value of the corresponding external loading component 
along the boundary. As an example, consider a typical stress resultant Nifo on 
a given external boundary l/J = l/J'. If the displacement Difo(l/J') is not prescribed 
a priori, along that boundary, then Nifo(l/J') is equal to the corresponding element 
of the external loading vector tlifo(l/J'). If tlifo(l/J') = 0, then Nifo(l/J') = O. 
We have outlined a quite general, energy-based approach that may be 
developed and extended to solve many complex problems in the field of shells 
of revolution on a fairly routine, automated basis. This technique is developed 
quite completely in a companion volume,53 and an example of the capability 
for analyzing a torospherical shell was shown in figure 9-12(c). 
9.4 Shells of Translation 
9.4.1 General: The general theory of shells of translation, apart from cylindrical 
shells, is lightly treated in contemporary English-language textbooks. Although 
there are many papers in the literature that describe analysis methods for such 
shells, most are based on idealized boundary conditions that do not necessarily 
match the physical situation very closely. For example, the inclusion of flexible 
edge members, which are often present in reality, greatly complicates the analysis. 
From a practical standpoint, however, numerous translational shells having 
spectacularly large spans have been constructed. As an example, we may take 
the shell shown in figure 2-8(a). Such major structures certainly warrant a com-
plete investigation, beyond the scope of the membrane theory. The means for 
carrying out such investigations are often computer-based numerical solutions, 
such as finite element or finite difference techniques, or carefully executed 
experimental studies using physical models. The current availability and capa-
bilities of numerical analysis procedures for translational shells are described 
in Schnobrich.54 Here, we introduce two theories upon which many of the 
currently popular numerical algorithms are founded. 
9.4.2 Mushtari-Donnell-Vlasov (MDV) Theory: This theory is a simplification 
of the general theory of shells in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and is based 
on the assumptions that (a) the effect of the transverse shear forces Q", and Qp 
in the in-plane equilibrium equations is negligible; and, (b) the influence of the 
normal displacement Dn will predominate over the influences of the in-plane 
displacements Da. and Dp in the bending response of the shell. We have discussed 
the first assumption at length in connection with other derivations, and it 
should be acceptable provided the membrane theory boundary conditions 
are not grossly violated. The second assumption is most feasible as the shell 
becomes relatively flatter, approaching a plate. Such a shell is said to be shallow. 

444 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
Shallow shells were introduced in section 2.8.1, and we build on this geometric 
concept in the following paragraphs. Some quantitative criteria for a shell to 
be classified as shallow are also stated later. 
Proceeding, we first consider the force equilibrium equations in general form, 
equations (3.17). We omit the transverse shear stress terms as stated in assump-
tion (a) and take NlZp = NplZ = S: 
(BNIZ),IZ + (AS),p + A,pS -
B,lZNp + qlZAB = 0

IZ

(9. 177a) 
(9. 177b) 
(9. 177c) 
We first wish to express the transverse shear forces in terms of the normal 
displacement Dn. With transverse shearing strains suppressed, QIZ and Qp are 
given in terms of the stress couples through equations (3.22a) and (3.22b): 
1 
Qp = AB [(BMIZP),IZ + (AMp),p + B,IZMplZ -
A,pMIZJ 
(9.178a) 
(9.178b) 
Next, we apply the constitutive law matrix 6-2, omitting the thermal terms, and 
take M IZP = MplZ to write the stress couples as functions of KIZ, Kp, and r: 
MIZ = D(KIZ + JlKp) 
Mp = D(JlKIZ + Kp) 
M IZP = D(1 -
Jl)r 
(9. 179a) 
(9.179b) 
(9.179c) 
Before substituting equations (9. 179a-c) into (9.178a) and (9.178b), we express 
the changes in curvature as functions of the displacements. These relationships 
are given, in general, by equations (5.47a-c), but we invoke assumption (b) and 
eliminate the contributions of DIZ and Dp. The simplified compatibility equations 
are

9.4 Shells of Translation 
445 
and then into equations (9.178a) and (9.178b). The algebra is considerable, and 
we defer to N ovozhilov5 5 to write 
(9.181a) 
(9.181b) 
where the Laplacian, in general terms, is given by 
V2( ) = AlB {[~ ( ),aJ.a + [~( ),pJ.J 
(9.181c) 
Finally, substituting equations (9.181a) and (9.181b) into equation (9. 177c) and 
dividing through by AB, we obtain

which we recognize as being very similar to the equilibrium equation for plates. 
Thus, we have equations (9. 177a) and (9. 177b), together with equations (9.183) 
and the requisite boundary conditions, constituting the shell theory which 
was apparently derived independently by Mushtari in the Soviet Union and 
Donnell in the United States.55 
The governing equations at this stage of the development are somewhat 
similar to those encountered in section 8.7.5 following the derivation of equation 
(8.294). Equations (8.252) and (8.294) formed a coupled set of equations for the 
finite displacement theory of plates. The dependent variables in those equations 
were the normal displacement and the in-plane stress resultants; that is essentially 
the same situation we now have with equations (9.177a) and (9.177b) and 
equation (9.183). Therefore, the introduction of a stress function !II', defined

The steps in the back substitution are tedious and, basically, are similar to 
our previous exercises in the development of the von Karman equations in 
section 8.7.5. We omit the details and follow the procedure suggested by 
Vlasov.57 Also, we consider the special case in which the in-plane components 
of the surface loading q/Z and qp are equal to O. The resulting equations are

(9.185a) 
(9.185b) 
(9.186a) 
(9.186b) 
The equalities in equations (9.185a) and (9.185b) have been obtained by invoking 
equation (2.37), the third Gauss-Codazzi relationship; the second term in 
equation (9.186a) is expressed in terms of the operator V2( ) by using the first 
two Gauss-Codazzi relations, equations (2.35) and (2.36). 
It may now be argued that for certain classes of problems, equations (9.185a) 
and (9.185b) may be considered to be satisfied. First, for shells of zero Gaussian 
curvature, such as cylindrical or conical shells, equations (9.185a) and (9.185b) 
are identically satisfied. Also, if we think of shells that are relatively flat or 
shallow, the Gaussian curvature will be small and the coefficients of ff',/Z and 
ff',p in equations (9.185a) and (9.185b) will be an order of magnitude smaller 
than the coefficients of the same terms in equations (9.186), so the former equa-
tions can be regarded to be approximately satisfied. A third class of problems 
for which the first two equations may be ignored are those cases in which the 
stress resultants are rapidly varying functions of ex and p. Then, the higher 
derivatives of § 
predominate, and the contribution of the terms associated 
with ff',/Z and ff',p will be relatively small as compared to those multiplying ff',,.,. 
and ff',pp. Similar reasoning was used to motivate the Geckeler approximation 
in section 9.3.2.3. 
We now seek a second relationship between Dn and ff'. This accomplishment 
is attributed to Vlasov by Novozhilov58 and requires two general steps. 
The first operation is the derivation of the compatibility equations for the 
deformation of the middle surface in terms of strains and curvatures only. These 
equations are analogous to the S1. Venant equations of the theory of elasticity 
and may be established by following the same steps employed in the derivation 
of the Gauss-Codazzi relations in section 2.6, if the tangent vectors to the de-
formed middle surface are used in place of the tangent vectors to the undeformed 

9.4 Shells of Translation 
447 
middle surface. Specifically, t n , .. and tn,p in equation (2.33) are replaced by ( .. 
and r:p, as given by equations (5.9) and (5.11), respectively. Then the identical 
steps are carried out on these tangent vectors to derive the compatibility 
equations, which may be viewed as Gauss-Codazzi relations for the deformed 
middle surface.57 
The second operation required is the substitution of equations (9. 180a-c) for 
the changes in curvature; the replacement of the in-plane strains by the corre-
sponding stress resultants using matrix 6-2; and the subsequent introduction 
of the stress function ff via equations (9. 184a-c). 
The final result, after eliminating terms similar to those previously dropped 
in equations (9.185a) and (9.185b), is 
1 
-
-V4ff -
V 2D = 0 
Eh 
n 
(9.187) 
Thus, the solution of the coupled equations (9.186a) and (9.187) is sufficient to 
describe the complete pattern of stress and deformation within the limitations 
of the approximations introduced in the course of the derivation. Novozhilov 
observed that these equations form the basis for the investigation of many 
practical problems. 59 Also, explicit solutions are provided by Vlasov60 and are 
based on some further approximations: (a) the shell is described by Cartesian 
coordinates, with 
A=B::::::1 
(9.188) 
and, (b) R .. and Rp are taken as constant (average values) and are given by 
R .. (X, Y) = Rx 
Rp(X, Y) = fiy 
(9.189) 
(9.190) 
These assumptions are specifically tied to the shallow shell notion and, according 
to Vlasov, can be utilized for shells that cover rectangular plan areas if the rise 
is no more than 1/5 of the smaller side of the rectangle. 
The introduction of the simplifications given in equations (9.188)-(9.190) into 
the previous equations reduces the operators V2( ) and V2( ) to 
V2( ) = ( ),xx + ( ), yy 
(9.191) 
and 
-2 
1 
1 
V ( ) = fiy ( ),xx + fix ( ),yy 
(9.192) 
where fiy and Rx are average values of the radii of curvature along the respective 
coordinate lines. The solution then proceeds with the introduction of a potential 
function G, such that

(9.194) 
There is a marked similarity between equation (9.194) and equation (9.75), 
which governs the general bending of cylindrical shells, and the solution strat-
egies are similar. Once G is found, ff is determined from equation (9.193b). 
The interested reader is referred to Vlasov62 for the complete development 
of this solution. As an example, the bending of an elliptic paraboloid shell of 
a similar configuration to that shown on figure 4-51 can be investigated using 
equation (9.194). Also, these equations can be readily generalized to the study 
of the instability of certain shells, as we see later. 
9.4.3 Theory of Shallow Shells: The theory of shallow shells is roughly equivalent 
to the simplification of the MDV theory that is facilitated by equations (9.189) 
and (9.190) and has been widely used for shell analysis. The approach is to 
employ some simplifying assumptions at the outset to derive the governing 
equations in a form which is particularly suited for shell roofs covering rect-
angular plan areas. This theory has also been used to analyze shells that 
become locally shollow when the original shell is divided into finite segments 
or elements-a procedure to which we have often alluded in our previous 
discussions. 
Refer to the basic geometric relationships introduced in section 2.8.1. Recalling 
the assumption that (Z.x)2 and (Z'y)2 may be neglected in comparison to unity, 
we may evaluate the principal radii of curvature from equation (2.29)

The expressions for the extensional strains Bx and By are obtained directly 
from equation (5.46a) and (5.46b) as 
(9.196a) 
and 
(9. 196c) 
The equation for the in-plane shearing strain could similarly be written from 

9.4 Shells of Translation 
449 
equation (S.46c). However, it is more correct to use a somewhat different form 
that arises be,cause the Cartesian coordinates are not orthogonal when projected 
on the surface. The expanded form of ill is63 
(9.197) 
The term Z,XY = -(l/Rxy) may be called the twisting curvature, and was 
encountered previously in section 4.4.2 when planar X - Y coordinates were 
also used. Additionally, we have the expressions for ,,«, "p, and 'r, which, with 
A = B = 1, reduce to 
"x = -D,.,xx 
Icy = -D,.,yy 
'r = -Dn,xy 
(9. 198a) 
(9.198b) 
(9.198c) 
Equations (9.196)-(9.198) are the strain-displacement or compatibility equa-
tions for this theory. 
We now proceed as in the previous section. The analogue to the normal 
equilibrium equation, (9.186a) and (9.186b), is64 
(9.199) 
where the stress function is related to the stress resultants by the simplified form 
of equations (9.184a-c), 
Nx = ff,yy 
Ny = ff,xx 
S = -ff,XY 
(9.200a) 
(9.200b) 
(9.200c) 
Similarly, an analogous equation to equation (9.187) is developed. This 
equation is written as65 
;h V4ff + (Z,yyD,.,xx - 2Z, xyD,.,xy + Z,xxD,..yy) = EhP 
where P is derived from the applied surface loading as 
P = (1 + fl)(Px,yy + Py,xx) -

Px(X, Y) = f

Py(X, Y) = f

(9.201d) 
(9.201e)

9 Shell Bending and Instability 
Px and Py in equations (9.201c) and (9.201d) are cumulative in-plane forces and 
are set to 0 on boundaries that are unrestrained in the X and Y directions, 
respectively. Note that this theory is slightly complicated by starting with 
non-orthogonal coordinates, but retains the generality of including the in-plane 
components of the surface loading qx and qy. For most shells encountered in 
practice, the MDV theory and the theory of shallow shells are fairly equivalent 
and both are sometimes referred to as shallow shell theories. From an applica-
tions standpoint, the most significant difference is probably in the nature of the 
external boundaries. If the boundaries are coincident with the coordinate lines 
of the middle surface, the general form of the M ushtari - Donnell-Vlasov theory 
is appropriate; if the boundaries fall along the Cartesian coordinate lines, the 
theory of shallow shells, or the even simpler specialization of the MDV theory, 
seems to be more attractive. 
9.4.4 Strain Energy for Shallow Shells: The energy expressions and principles 
derived in chapter 7 are directly adaptable to shells of translation, but we have 
not carried out the details of the specializations based on the theories presented 
in the last two sectons. However, it is of general interest to examine the expres-
sion for strain energy, equation (7.6), using the simplified strain-displacement 
relationship, equations (9.196)-(9.198). With the transverse shearing strains 
neglected, term [I] of equation (7.7) becomes

(9.204) 
is frequently encountered in the literature. The thermal terms, as defined in 
equation (7.6), can easily be added if required.

9.5.1 General: Local instabilities, characterized by displacements of compara-
tively small wave length similar to those occurring in plate structures, may be 
significant in thin-walled vessels where compressive stresses are present. This 
type of instability is delineated from general instability, which could corre-
spond to the buckling of an entire stack or tower as a beam-column. Since the 
amplitudes encountered in local instabilities are comparatively small, this phe-
nomenon can be analyzed in many cases by using the simplifications of the 
shallow shell theories presented in the previous sections. 
There are several possible approaches to the elastic instability analysis of 
shells. These are illustrated schematically on figure 9-14, where we have plotted 
the normal displacement, Dn, against a loading parameter, N, which represents 
some combination of the in-plane loading. 
First, if we can arrive at a general solution for the normal displacement in 
the presence of transverse and in-plane loading, and then we observe that 
certain discrete values of N cause the displacements to become excessively large, 
we term these values of N the critical loads for a perfect shell, Ncr. This is 
illustrated by the curves labeled 1 in figure 9-14, with the various branches 
corresponding to different magnitudes of the known transverse loading. This 

452 
9 Shell Bending and Instability 
approach was used for the study of plate instability in section 8.7.3. Note that 
the same Ncr is obtained regardless of the transverse loading, which we call qn 
for shells. 
The second approach follows from the realization that ~r is independent of 
qn' This suggests that the transverse loading can be ignored in the stability 
analysis, which means that for N < Ncr> Dn = O. This is indicated by curve 2, 
which is the special case of 1 for qn = O. Then, at N = ~r> the displacements 
become unbounded as before, following path 3. This approach is attractive 
because the complete solution for Dn as a function of qn and N is not required. 
Rather, the states of equilibrium just prior to and just after instability can be 
examined without concern for the remainder of the load-deflection curve. At 
the transition point (~r> 0), a bifurcation of equilibrium is said to occur, since 
there are at least two possible states of equilibrium, Dn = 0 and Dn --+ 00. This 
approach is, of course, familiar from the classical solution of the Euler column 
buckling problem. In regard to the unbounded displacements following bifurca-
tion, curve 3, a more sophisticated analysis may yield an unstable (descending) 
post-buckling path, curve 4. 
Although it is implied by curve 2 that the equilibrium path prior to buckling 
is linear, buckling of shells may also be preceded by a nonlinear pre buckling 
response, such as a curve 1.66 The bifurcation would then occur at the intersection 
of curves 1 and 4.67 
A third approach which should be mentioned is that of using geometrically 
nonlinear strain-displacement relationships to determine the complete load-
deflection curve-unloading as well as loading. As illustrated by curve 5, 
a critical load Ncr(nl)' which occurs at a limit point, may be found somewhat 
below Ncr. A classical illustration is an axially compressed conical shell, such 
as that shown in figure 4-13, where the axial shortening and accompanying 
rotational deformation would cause an immediate degradation of the stiffness.66 
Then, the curve would show unloading, and perhaps reloading, as other ele-
ments of resistance are mobilized by the finite deformations. If this latter 
resistance is adequate, the load may eventually surpass NCr(nl) and even Ncr> 
provided the material capacity is not exceeded. An actual shell cannot unload 
in most cases, so there may be a sudden transition from the loading to the 
reloading branches ofthe curve at N = ~r(nl)' with a corresponding jump in Dn. 
This is termed snap-through buckling and is characteristic of shallow arches 
and shells. 
Shells with initial imperfections follow a path such as 5. As the magnitude 
of the imperfections decreases, the descending branch of curve 5 approaches 
curve 4. 
Note that all three of the general approaches discussed have been predicated 
on elastic buckling. If material nonlinearities are present for N :5; ~r> then 
additional complications arise. Sometimes these can be handled conveniently 
by the tangent modulus theory. 

9.5 Instability and Finite Deformations 
453 
9.5.2 Equilibrium Equation Method: As we mentioned in our discussion of the 
bifurcation of equilibrium approach to elastic instability in the previous section, 
we need only consider the immediate neighborhood of the transition point 
(Ncr> 0). Up to this point, the shell will be regarded as being subject to a membrane 
state of stress Nxo, Nyo, and 80 .68 At the transition point, the greatly increased 
normal displacements result in the development of normal components of these 
in-plane stress resultants. Such normal components may be treated as surface 
loading in the tn direction, since the starting point for the analysis is the state 
of stress Nxo, Nyo, and So. With this in mind, the normal components of the 
membrane stress resultants are used for qn in equations (9.183) and (9.186a) if 
the MDV theory is used; in equation (9.194) if the simplified version ofthe MDV 
theory is used; and in equation (9.199) if we choose the theory of shallow shells. 
It now remains to determine the normal components of the membrane stress 
resultants. 
Refer to figure 8-30, where the normal components of the in-plane stress 
resultants for a plate are apparent. (The analysis corresponding to this figure 
is contained in section 8.7.1.) Since the net normal force due to any single 
stress resultant is the difference of the normal projections at the two ends of 
the differential segment, that analysis is valid for shells as well. Following 
equation (8.250), with the transverse shear forces and in-plane loads omitted, 
we have for Cartesian coordinates 
(9.205) 
With transverse shearing strains suppressed and Nxyo = So, and with Dx and 
Dy neglected in comparison with Dn in the Cartesian coordinate version of 
equations (5.46g) and (5.46h) in the spirit of the shallow shell assumptions, 
we have 
Dxy = -Dn,x} 
Dyx = -Dn,y 
so that 
qnl = NxoDn,xx + NYODn,n + 2S0 Dn,xy 
which is sometimes written as 
qnl = - [NxoKx + NYOKy + 2So.] 
(9.206) 
(9.207a) 
(9.207b) 
in view of equations (9.198). For orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, the same 
analysis is valid, and 
qnl = - [NaOKa + NpoKp + 2So.] 
(9.207c) 
We proceed with the simplest of the three theories, the MDV theory in 
Cartesian coordinates. The governing equation is written in terms of the po-
tential function G from equation (9.194) and qn is taken as qnl' as given by

We shall apply this equation to the stability analysis of spherical shells in 
a later section, but first we develop the energy method. 
9.5.3 Energy Method for Cylindrical Shells: From an energy standpoint, the 
transition between the pre buckled and post buckled states may be represented 
by the following stability criterion:70 (a) there is no bending prior to the onset 
of buckling, so that the total strain energy is due to the in-plane stress resultants; 
(b) at the onset of instability, there are additional contributions to the strain 
energy due to middle surface straining and bending; and, (c) the increase in 
strain energy as buckling occurs must be equal to the work done by the external 
loading and by the components of the in-plane forces that act through normal 
displacements. The latter source of "external" work is analogous to the load 
component qnl introduced in the previous section and is not present during 
infinitesimal deformations. We illustrate this for a cylindrical shell under uni-
form axial loading, as shown in figure 9-15. 
We first consider the strains and charges in curvature prior to and following 
buckling. 
In the pre buckled state, which we designated by the subscript 0, we assume 
that there is no bending. There is no normal loading acting, so that the third 
equilibrium equation, (9.5b), with Qx = qnO = 0, gives NfJO = O. We now refer to 
the constitutive law, equations (6.1) with IX = X, f3 = (), and no thermal terms.

118xo 
(9.214) 
Also, we have the change in curvature after buckling 
KX = -Dn•XX 
(9.215) 
Of course, Kx = 0 prior to buckling. 
Now, we may evaluate the change in strain energy during buckling. We may 
specialize equation (7.6) for the case of cylindrical shells with axisymmetric 
loading to 
Ean fL { 2 2 
h2 2} 
U. = 1 _ 112 
0 
h(8X + 80 + 2118x80 ) + 12 Kx dX 
(9.216) 
The change in strain energy is given by 
I1U. = U.(8x , 80 , Kx) -
U.o(8xo, 800 , 0) 
(9.217) 
We substitute equations (9.214), (9.212), and (9.215), respectively, for 8x , 80' and 
Kx into equation (9.216) to compute U.; also, using equations (9.21Oa) and 
(9.21Ob), we take 8xo and -118xo for 8x and 80 , respectively, to evaluate U.o. 
Equation (9.217) then becomes 
I1U. = an SaL [Eh(~ny -
2I1Eh8XO(~n) + D(Dn.xx)2]dX 
(9.218) 
Next, we consider the work done by the external loading and the normal 
components of the in-plane forces during buckling. For the external loading, 
N = -N"r and 
I1UqN = 2na SaL -N"r(8x - 8xo)dX 
= 2l1nN"r SaL Dn dX 
(9.219) 
in view of equation (9.214). Note that there is no 1/2 coefficient in this expres-
sion, since the full N"r is already present prior to the onset of buckling. For the 
normal components of the in-plane forces, refer to the loading qnl given by 

9.5 Instability and Finite Deformations 
457 
equation (9.207a). The work done over the circumference by qnl acting through 
Dn is 
AUqn = ~ SoL (qnlDn)(2nadX) 
(9.220a) 
In equation (9.207a) for qnl' we take Nxo = - ~r and N yO = So = 0, whereupon 
equation (9.220a) becomes 
AUqn = - SOL TCaNcrDn.xxDndX 
(9.220b) 
Adding equations (9.219) and (9.220b), we have 
AUq = AUq[il + AUqn 
= 2TCNcr {1l SoL [Dn - ~Dn.xxDnJdX} 
(9.221) 
Finally, equating equations (9.218) and (9.221) completes the application of the 
stability criterion: 
(9.222) 
These equations can be treated most easily with a Rayleigh-Ritz-type approxi-
mation for D •. We provide an example in a later section.

membrane boundary conditions. A direct treatment of spherical shell buckling 
in polar coordinates is developed in Brush and Almroth. 72 
Note that we have arrived at the lowest critical load, without first finding 
a general solution for the normal displacement Dn. Subsequently we may 
investigate the normal displacement Dn , which is the mode shape of the buckle. 
If we return to equation (9.208d), 
Dn = V4 G 
= V2(AG) 
= AV2G 
The potential function G, in turn, is found from equation (9.228) 
V 2 G -
AG = 0 
(9.235) 
(9.236) 
where A is given by equation (9.233). The solutions of equation (9.236) are the 
eigenfunctions of the problem. Recall, however, that we have used the simplest 
form of the MDV theory based on Cartesian coordinates. Consequently, 
solutions of equations (9.235) and (9.236) that satisfy the kinematic boundary 
conditions are only feasible if the shell covers a rectangular plan area. For 
boundaries coincident with the coordinate lines, the original form of the theory, 
equations (9.186a), (9.t86b), and (9.187), should be used in place of the sub-
sequently simplified equation (9.194). This is carried out in some detail in 
Vlasov,73 where it is shown that the lowest critical pressure only differs from 
Perl' as computed from equation (9.234), by a term of 0 [11(h/a)]: 1. Nevertheless, 
the more rigorous solution provides a basis for determining the eigenfunctions 
and subsequent displacement or mode shapes. In many applications, only Perl 
is of interest, and the solution obtained from equation (9.234) is sufficient to 
estimate the buckling pressure. Note that, in this regard, quite large factors 
of safety against elastic buckling-perhaps three to five or even more-are 
commonly specified for the design of thin shells. Since the bifurcation analysis 
accounts for neither initial imperfections nor nonlinear behavior, the critical 
pressure obtained theoretically is very difficult to approach in reality, even 
in carefully controlled experiments,74 and a very ample factor of safety is 
prudent unless a more sophisticated analysis can be accomplished. A means for 
introducing additional refinements into the analysis is described in section 9.5.6. 
However, many design procedures are based on the elastic critical load, reduced 
substantially by a "knockdown factor."

buckling ofthe shell shown in figure 9-15. We use the energy criterion, equation

The length of the buckled waves is given, in terms of the characteristic fo 
term noted in section 9.2.2.2, by 
(9.243) 
which may be useful for establishing the proper meridional spacing of ring 
stiffeners. 
The identical result may be obtained by solving the equilibrium equation, 
equation (9.209). 
Various other specific solutions based on the two approaches developed in 
this chapter are available in the literature for spherical and cylindrical shells. 

9.5 Instability and Finite Deformations 
461 
Using either the differential equation or the energy approach, the solutions 
are quite simple and may be used for other geometries with some judicious 
geometric approximations (see Vlasov 75 and Fliigge 76). Also, an extensive 
array of more complex situations, including body forces, fluid pressure, tor-
sion, orthotropic shells, and initial imperfections, is treated in Brush and 
Almroth. 77 
9.5.6 Finite Deformation of Shallow Shells: Recall from section 8.7.5 that 
the introduction of the geometrically nonlinear strain-displacement rela-
tions, (8.289a-c), lead to the von Karman equations, describing finite de-
formations for plates. Vlasov has derived a similar set of equations for shallow 
shells. 78 
In this case, the nonlinear strain-displacement relations are the same as for 
plates, except that ex and By each have an additional term proportional to 
the radii of curvature, as we may verify from equations (5.46a) and (5.46b). 
Therefore, the appropriate equations in Cartesian coordinates are

ex = Dx.x + Rx + :2(Dn,x) 
(9.244a) 
(9.244b)

as the generalized form of that compatibility equation. As before,.JF is the stress 
function defined by equations (8.295). 
Now, considering the second equation which was derived for plates as 
equation (8.297), note that this equation followed from equation (8.252), which 
is the finite displacement version of the basic biharmonic equation for plate 
bending, equation (8.12). Following the same reasoning, the generalization of 
equation (8.12) to shallow shell theory is equation (9.183), where the term

is added to the l.h.s. This term enters into the shallow shell equivalent of 
equation (8.252) as

and subsequently into the shallow shell form of equation (8.297) as

(9.246) 
Equations (9.245) and (9.246) constitute the generalized von Karman equations, 
which form a finite deformation theory for shallow shells. In these equations, 
the in-plane stress resultants Ny and Ny are assumed as positive. The corre-
sponding plate equations (8.296) and (8.297), of course, follow for Rx = Ry = 00; 
also, for a cylindrical shell of radius a, Rx = 00 and Ry = a. Similarly, for 
a spherical shell with radius a, Rx = Ry = a. 
We have noted in the previous section that the elastic buckling load based 
on infinitesimal deformation theory, as presented in sections 9.5.1 through 9.5.5, 
may only be a rough indication of the load at which an actual shell may buckle. 
We have also suggested that a more elaborate analysis may provide theoretical 
results which are in reasonable agreement with physical experiments. Such 
an analysis has been provided by two of the most distinguished mechanicians 
and engineers of the twentieth century, T. von Karman and H. S. Tsein, in 
their study of the postbuckling behavior of cylindrical shells based on the finite 
deformation equations presented in this section.so They used a Rayleigh-Ritz 
approach and assumed an approximate expression for Dn , selecting the un-
specified parameters based on minimization of the potential energy functional 
and on some test results. This analysis provides a strain energy expression 
similar to equation (9.238), modified by a factor proportional to the buckled 
normal deflection to thickness ratio Dn/h. For Dn/h = 0, the critical load is given 
by equation (9.242); as Dn/h increases, the critical load decreases rapidly to only 
about 1/3 of this value. S ! 
A frcq uently used equation for the buckling of axially loaded cylindrical shells 
based on their analysis is 
Eh2 
Ncr! = 3ay'[3(1 _ J.l2)] 
Eh2 
~0.2-
a 
(9.247) 
implying a "knockdown factor" of 3 when compared to equation (9.242). 
By way of confirmation of this theory, an experimental study of open alumi-
num cylindrical shells with simply supported, uniformly compressed ends and 
free longitudinal edges by Yang and Guralnick gave measured buckling loads 

9.5 Instability and Finite Deformations 
463 
that correlated quite well with numerical predictions based on equations (9.241a), 
(9.241 b), and (9.242). 82 It was observed that the correlation between analytically 
predicted and experimentally measured buckling loads was considerably better 
than similar comparisons for closed cylindrical shells. It was also noted that 
open shells have a theoretical critical stress of only 10% to 15% of the cor-
responding values for comparable closed shells in the range of parameters 
investigated. A relatively complete compilation of the rather extensive literature 
in this area is contained in the study. 
9.5.7 Postbuckling and Imperfection Sensitivity: Inasmuch as the theoretically 
determined buckling load calculated by a small deflection theory is rarely 
attained or even approached in experiments, attention has been focused on 
the sources of discrepancy such as (a) the influence of boundary conditions; 
(b) the presence of prebuckling deformations caused by edge constraints; and, 
(c) the effect of initial imperfections.83 It is generally assumed that the initial 
imperfections are the most influential contributor. 
The effect of initial imperfections is closely related to the load-displacement 
response following the onset of buckling, the postbuckling path. Although the 
calculation of the secondary equilibrium path is beyond our present scope, we 
may observe some possibilities from figure 9-14. Curve 4 has a negative slope 
and is said to be unstable, whereas a system which follows curve 5 and snaps 
through to the positive slope branch is said to be stable in the post buckling 
region. The possibilities for slightly imperfect shells are indicated more clearly 
in figure 9_16,83 where three cases are shown. Between the cases of stable 
symmetric post buckling (I) and unstable symmetric post buckling (III) is the 
case of un symmetric post buckling (II), which may follow a stable or unstable 
course. 
Structures which behave as case I are said to be imperfection-insensitive. For 
this case, the classical buckling load is a useful measure, whereas for the other 
cases, a more refined calculation is usually necessary. Imperfection-sensitive 
structures may be prone to a more violent buckling failure and sudden collapse, 
so that a careful analysis is warranted. The seminal contribution in the field of 
postbuckling analysis and imperfection sensitivity is the theory of Koiter.83.84 
Rotational shells subject to axial compression are generally highly imper-
fection sensitive; in the case of plates or shallow roof shells which can develop 
a secondary mode of resistance such as cantenary or tension field action, 
buckling is relatively insensitive to initial imperfections. 
Shells may also buckle under external normal pressure or internal suction. 
Spherical shells under such loading are generally imperfection-sensitive. More 
generally, Wittek85 considered free-ended rotational shells of varying Gaussian 
curvature, i.e., an ellipsoid (+), a cylinder (0), and a hyperboloid ( -), under 
an axisymmetrical normal pressure. In figure 9-17, results are shown for the 
critical pressure A. as a function of RdR2' where Rl = Ro (,p = n12) which is pro-
portional to Re, and R2 = R~. Three different computations were performed.

The upper curve, Aero is the small deformation (linear) critical load, whereas 
the lower curve, Ab' is a reduced critical load based only on the bending portion 
of the strain energy, roughly equivalent to neglecting the group I terms in 
equation (7.7). The latter calculation is claimed to yield a lower bound solution 
to the linear buckling value. The third computation, a nonlinear analysis 
indicated by the plotted points, will be discussed subsequently. 
Buckling may be idealized as a shift in the load resistance mechanism from 
a stiff membrane mode, associated with the group I terms in equation (7.7), 
to a more flexible bending mode. Accordingly, the initial imperfections would 
be primarily acted upon by the in-plane stress resultants. It follows that this 
sensitivity would be measured by the difference of the curves, Acr -
Ab = Am. 
This difference ()bviously reduces with decreasing Gaussian curvature and is 
quantified by the factor (1.g. In the negative curvature region, the points where 
the curves intersect correspond to geometrical combinations for which pure 
bending or inextensional deformations, discussed in section 4.3.6.1, may occur. 
Between the curves for Acr and Ab' the plotted points indicate values calculated 
by a nonlinear analysis. The difference between these values and the lower curve 
is regarded as confirmation of Ab as the lower bound, not only for the linear but 
also for the nonlinear critical load. 
Shells must also be investigated for buckling due to asymmetric normal 
pressure, such as the wind load depicted on figure 4-36(a) for a spherical shell 
and on figure 4-34 for a cylinder or hyperboloid. We expect buckling to initiate 
in regions of high compression under those loading conditions.

9 Shell Bending and Instability 
For the spherical shell, the resultants plotted in figure 4-36(b) indicate that 
there are regions along the windward meridian where both N,p and NIJ are 
compressive. This is true for the simplified as well as for the realistic pressure 
distribution. The biaxial state of compression tends to increase the imperfection 
sensitivity. 
In contrast, for the cylindrical shell considered in section 4.3.7.4, the circum-
ferential stress resultant No is proportional to the load, equation (4.149b), and 
thus would be compressive along the windward meridian, () = 0°. However, 
the meridional stress, equation (4.149a), would be tensile in this region as a 
result of overturning and would tend to counter a circumferentially initiated 
buckle. Similarly, in the separation zone, () ~ 70°, the tendency for a me-
ridionally initiated buckle due to a compressive N,p is countered by a tensile 
value of NIJ. The same behavior is true for hyperboloidal shells. Such shells, 
where the compression is only uniaxial and perhaps opposed in the perpen-
dicular direction, may be regarded as imperfection-insensitive for that particular 
loading case. For an axial or self-load, a state of biaxial compression may be 
present in the same shell, e.g., figure 4-8, and the shell would be more sensitive 
to imperfections.

CHAPTER 10 
Conclusion 
10.1 General 
The preceding chapters have treated the analysis of thin elastic plates and shells 
from a unified viewpoint, insofar as possible. Specializations to specific forms-
e.g., membrane shells, flat plates-were introduced in a logical sequence after 
the general aspects of the theory were set forth. The emphasis was on explaining 
the mechanics of surface structures, with ample examples to illustrate the most 
important aspects. In general, relatively simple and idealized cases, which could 
readily be solved analytically, were used to illustrate the salient points. Fairly 
complete compilations of known analytical solutions for both plates 1 and thin 
shells2 are available elsewhere to supplement the examples given in the text. 
The solution of more complex structures is relegated to the domain of numerical 
analysis, and several citations to the literature in this area were provided. 
Although the calculations for those situations may be more involved, such 
structures generally reflect the same basic behavioral characteristics as the 
relatively simple illustrations contained in this book. 
10.2 Proportioning 
One aspect of the shell design process that has not been extensively addressed 
in this text is proportioning. Rather, the emphasis here has been on analysis. 
In a practical sense, proportioning is vital, and it is our hope that interest in 
this topic has been aroused. It is clear that the specific form of a surface 
structure is mainly determined by the anticipated function: flat plates for 
carrying pedestrian and vehicular traffic, shells of revolution for containment, 
and shallow shells for long, clear-span roofs. Also, the construction materials-
generally metals and/or concrete-playa very important role in the propor-
tioning process. 
Although the proportioning of surface structures is obviously very much 
related to the anticipated function and the material of construction, it is possible 
to offer a few general comments on this topic. We consider separately (a) regions 
472 

10.2 Proportioning 
473 
of the structure where the stresses are primarily in-plane or membrane; and, 
(b) regions where there is significant bending action. 
In case (a), direct tensile stresses should be resisted entirely by reinforcing 
steel in concrete shells, or by providing ample wall thicknesses for metal shells. 
Regions with direct compressive stresses are generally controlled by stability 
requirements, particularly in metal plate structures. 
For case (b), the bending moments or stress couples may be resisted by con-
sidering a concrete section with reinforcement near the surfaces to act as a wide 
flexural member. However, the relatively small effective depth available may 
complicate the provision of ample reinforcing steel. For thin metal structures, 
it is often impractical to resist high local bending stresses with the basic shell 
thickness, so that stiffening members are attached. 
Beyond these brief generalizations, the proportioning ofthin surface structures 
is a somewhat subjective and always challenging branch of structural design 
which has become somewhat specialized for various structural forms and 
materials. 
For thin concrete shells, the Building Code Requirements for Reinforced 
Concrete (ACI 318) give some general guidelines. 3 The shell thickness and the 
reinforcement area and spacing should satisfy the conditions of strength and 
serviceability which prevail for all concrete structures. Additionally, thin shells 
must be investigated for general and local instability. Often, the shell thickness 
is determined by the later consideration. 
Reinforcement is required to resist tensile stresses, as well as to control 
shrinkage and thermal cracking. The bars which resist the in-plane stress 
resultants should be placed in two or more directions and should ideally be 
oriented in the general directions of the principal tensile stresses, especially in 
regions of high tension. Often, however, this is impractical, so that the required 
resistance in every direction must be provided by an orthogonal mesh. A 
representative situation is illustrated in figure 10-1, where the various types 
of reinforcement required in an umbrella shell are shown. The orthogonal grid 
for the shell proper, the additional shell steel in the vicinity of the columns, and 
the edge beam reinforcement are difficult to accommodate in a relatively thin 
section, and careful planning and supervision are necessary to ensure a sound, 
crack-free structure. 
Reinforcement to resist stress couples should be placed near both faces even 
though moment reversal is not anticipated, since the bending may vary rapidly 
along the surface. The two layers may also include the membrane reinforcement, 
or there may be three or more layers. The provision of adequate clearance and 
cover may necessitate increasing the shell thickness in such cases. 
Of course, the edge members must be proportioned to resist the forces 
imparted by the shell. Often, an adjacent portion of the shell can be assumed 
to act with the member, or the edge member may be formed by a smooth 
transition from the shell cross section. Frequently in concrete shells, post-
tensioning is employed to improve the efficiency of these members.

10 Conclusion

Reinforcement for an Umbrella Shell (Courtesy Dr. A. Monsey) 
For steel tanks, J. N. Pirok and R. S. Wozniak4 have treated several aspects 
of proportioning. They discuss the calculation of the plate thickness in tensile 
regions with regard to efficiency of the welded joints. In regions of compression, 
the proper consideration of stability effects on the allowable stress is elaborated. 
In junction regions (rings and knuckles), guidelines are provided for deter-
mining the portion of the shell wall that might be effective as a ring beam, 
acting alone or with an additional structural member. Stiffeners and opening 
reinforcement are also discussed briefly. The tank shown in figure 2-8(r) serves 
as a representative example of these concepts. 
Beyond the rather general treatments elaborated in the preceding paragraphs, 
there are a number of authoritative works for concrete cooling towers, 5 steel 
tanks,6 pressure vessels, 7 and bins. 8, 9 Also, a number of unusual concrete tanks 
are analyzed and partially detailed in a recent volume on shell structures. 10 
10.3 Future Applications of Thin Shells 
At the conclusion of a book which focuses on a rather specialized class of 
structures, it seems appropriate to comment on future applications of such 
constructions. In particular, roof shells of reinforced concrete have been built 
far less frequently in the last quarter of the twentieth century than in the 

10.4 References 
475 
immediately preceding decades. This has been attributed to the increased 
availability of cheaper prefabricated systems. 11 
One of the world's most distinguished engineers, J. Schlaich, has recently 
considered this issue. 11 Schlaich eloquently states: 
1. Shells are the most honest structures. 
2. He, who cares about the shape of his structures, needs the shells. 
3. He, who cares about the genuine use of materials, does not want to miss the 
concrete shells. 
This being the case, he concludes that "he, who cares about beautiful and genuine 
structures, cannot accept the fact that concrete shells are slowly disappearing." 
He conjectures that with the imaginative application of modern falsework 
techniques, such as pneumatic forms, and new materials, such as fiber concrete, 
light and versatile concrete shells may again be competitive, especially if some 
premium is allowed for quality. 
Newspaper editor Horace Greeley, a renowned observer of the American 
scene, wrote in 1860: "I think concrete walls, rightly made, wi11last a thousand 
years." 12 The same is surely true of concrete shells, and it is a challenge to the 
present and future generations of structural engineers to see that such structures 
are indeed "rightly made."
