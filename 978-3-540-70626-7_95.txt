unique since there are inﬁnitely many decompositions of WS into nonorthogonal
states ψi′. Hence, the operator WS would represent formally an inﬁnite number of
ensembles ( ensembles in quantum mechanics) (n) (WS) := (pi(n), ψi(n)).
This means that the state WS is not sufﬁcient to determine a particular mixture
(n)(WS) of states that is actually realized. Even if WS admits “ignorance inter-
pretation” and can be interpreted as the description of some Gemenge (WS), new
arguments must be added for a complete determination of the Gemenge (WS) in
question.

However, the main question is still open. Does a given mixed state admit at all
“ignorance interpretation”? In other words, is it allowed to assume that a system S
with the mixed state WS =  piP[ϕi] is actually in one of the pure states ϕi, which
is, however, unknown to the observer who knows only the probabilities pi. If this
interpretation of WS were correct, then the mixed state would express the observers
“ignorance” of the actual pure state but not the objective indeterminacy of this state.
It is one of the most fundamental results of quantum mechanics that a mixed state in
general does not admit “ignorance interpretation”. The reason for this result is that
the assumption of a objectively decided pure state leads in general to contradictions
with well established results in quantum mechanics. This can be shown in various
ways and on different levels of generality [4, 5]. See also States, pure and mixed,
and their representations.
