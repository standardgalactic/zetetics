CHAPTER 3
Thermodynamics of the Earth’s
Atmosphere
In this chapter, we intersperse discussion of the contents of
Fermi’s notes with sections which review key topics in ther-
modynamics. Secs. (3.1)–(3.3), (3.5), and (3.6) review ther-
modynamics, while Secs. (3.4) and (3.7)–(3.10) expand on the
actual material in Fermi’s notes. More details on the subject
of thermodynamics can be found in Fermi’s own volume on
the subject (Fermi 1956).
Thermodynamics, a ﬁeld whose foundations were laid in
the nineteenth century, is founded on the realization that
heat is a form of energy and on the transformation of me-
chanical work into heat and of heat into mechanical work. It
was further elucidated by the development toward the end
of the nineteenth century of statistical mechanics. Statistical
mechanics demonstrated how the heat content of a gas could
be understood as the energy of motion of the molecules in
the gas.

CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
3.1
First Law of Thermodynamics
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is a statement of energy con-
servation as applied to thermal systems. For the most part,
in Fermi’s notes, the system is the atmosphere, a gas. The
internal energy of a gas or liquid is simply the total kinetic
and potential energy of the system of molecules present. The
internal energy is denoted as U. The system may expand (do
work) or be compressed (be worked on). Likewise, the sys-
tem may absorb or give oﬀheat. If ∆Q is the heat absorbed
in a thermodynamic process and ∆W is the work done by
the system in the same process, then conservation of energy
states
∆U = ∆Q −∆W.
(3.1)
Eq. (3.1) is quite general, requiring only that each term in
the equation is well deﬁned. The process may involve equi-
librium or nonequilibrium states, and the equation is inde-
pendent of the particular variables needed to specify internal
energy, heat, and work. In the next section, for processes con-
necting thermodynamic equilibrium states, it is shown how
to write the equation in terms of diﬀerential changes in ther-
modynamic variables.
3.2
State Variables. Entropy
The equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system is deﬁned
by the values of a small number of macroscopic variables. For
a gas containing a single type of molecule, the relevant vari-
ables are pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of
molecules in the system. Any three of these are enough to
specify the thermodynamic state of the system, the fourth
being speciﬁed by the equation of state. State variables are

3.2. STATE VARIABLES
37
independent of the history of the system and are either exten-
sive or intensive. Extensive variables, like volume and number
of particles, are “how much” variables. Intensive variables like
pressure and temperature, are “how strong” variables.
Neither work nor heat is a state variable. Both are physical
quantities whose values depend on the history of the system.
Taking a system through a closed cycle of thermodynamic
states, a net amount of work may be done, and heat absorbed
or given oﬀ. But the system could equally well have been left
in its initial state, and not taken through a cycle. In that
case, the net work done and heat absorbed are zero, so the
work done and the heat absorbed obviously depend on the
history of the system, not just its present state.
The work done by a gaseous system in going from state 1
to state 2 is given by
W1→2 =
Z 2
1
PdV.
(3.2)
The value of W1→2 depends on the particular path taken
through thermodynamic states in going from state 1 to state
2. For an inﬁnitesimal change, dW = PdV.
There is a state variable S, known as entropy, whose inte-
gral with respect to temperature expresses the heat absorbed
by the system. The concept of entropy was developed in the
nineteenth century by three of the founders of the study of
thermodynamics; Sadi Carnot, Rudolf Clausius, and William
Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who worked in France, Germany,
and Britain, respectively. Stated as an equation, the heat ab-
sorbed in a process which starts in state 1 and ends in state

38
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
2 is1
Q1→2 =
Z 2
1
TdS.
(3.3)
The heat absorbed in a transition between two thermody-
namic states depends on the path taken from state 1 to state
2, showing that Q1→2 is also not a state variable. For an
inﬁnitesimal change,
dQ = TdS.
(3.4)
Entropy, like volume, number of particles, and internal en-
ergy, is an extensive variable. The concept of entropy has
wide applicability beyond the realm of equilibrium thermo-
dynamics discussed here. It is commonly regarded as a mea-
sure of the disorder in a system; the higher the entropy, the
more disordered the system. For a thermodynamic system
in equilibrium, it is generally true that the entropy increases
when the temperature of the system increases.
We may now recast the ﬁrst law in diﬀerential form for
inﬁnitesimal processes that do not involve molecules either
entering or leaving the system. This is
dU = TdS −PdV.
(3.5)
In Sec. (3.5), we will generalize Eq. (3.5) to include the ﬂow
of molecules in or out of the system.
3.3
The Second Law of Thermodynamics. Carnot
Cycle
A formulation of the second law, due to Lord Kelvin, says
that heat extracted from a source kept at constant temper-
1The temperature T in Eq. (3.3) is the absolute temperature; such
that absolute zero, approximately −273◦C, is the lowest obtainable tem-
perature.

3.3. THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
39
ature cannot be fully transformed into work. Another one,
ﬁrst put forward by Clausius, says that it is impossible to
have a transformation whose only function is to transfer heat
from a body at lower temperature to one at higher tempera-
ture. The ideas associated with the second law are perhaps
best illustrated by making use of a process ﬁrst considered by
Carnot, and known ever since as the Carnot cycle. Although
not strictly needed to follow Fermi’s lecture notes, a discus-
sion of the Carnot cycle will allow us in Sec. (6.3) to discuss
a modern subject that surely would have been of interest to
Fermi: the use of Carnot cycles to understand the physics of
hurricanes.
Carnot Cycle
A Carnot cycle is a reversible cycle that
takes a gas through a sequence of four steps.
At the end
the gas has returned to its original state. The cycle operates
between two heat baths, one at absolute temperature T>,
and the other at absolute temperature T<, with T> greater
than T<. In the ﬁrst step of the cycle, the gas is placed in
contact with the heat bath at T> and allowed to expand.
In doing so, the gas performs work and absorbs an amount
of heat Q>, with the work performed equal to Q>. Since it
is at constant temperature, the internal energy of the gas
remains constant.
In the second step, the gas is removed
from the heat bath and allowed to expand a second time,
this time adiabatically, so no heat is transferred to or from
the gas. Again, in expanding, the gas performs work. In this
step, since there is no heat transfer, the gas lowers its internal
energy, and hence its temperature, arriving at the lower value,
T<. In the third step, the gas is placed in contact with a
heat bath at T< and compressed. Since work is performed
on the gas in this step, it gives oﬀheat Q<, where Q< is
equal to the work performed. Finally, in the last step, the
gas is again isolated and adiabatically compressed back to its

40
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
original state at the higher temperature, T>.
In the ﬁrst two steps of the cycle, the gas does work, and
in the last two steps of the cycle, work is done on the gas.
The diﬀerence between the work the gas does and the work
performed on it is the net work, W. By conservation of energy,
the net work is the heat absorbed minus the heat given oﬀ,
W = Q> −Q<.
(3.6)
The eﬃciency of the cycle is the ratio of the net work to the
heat absorbed,
η = W
Q>
= 1 −Q<
Q>
.
(3.7)
The eﬃciency can be expressed solely in terms of T> and
T< using the fact that the entropy of the system is a state
variable. In the isothermal expansion at temperature T>, the
entropy of the system increases by Q>/T>. The entropy does
not change in the following adiabatic expansion.
Then in
the isothermal compression at temperature T<, the entropy
decreases by Q</T<. In the ﬁnal adiabatic compression the
entropy does not change. Since the entropy is a state variable,
it must return to its initial value at the end of the cycle, so
the gain in the isothermal expansion at T> must be balanced
by the decrease in the isothermal expansion at T<, so
Q>
T>
= Q<
T<
,
(3.8)
or
Q<
Q>
= T<
T>
.
(3.9)
Using this in Eq. (3.7), we ﬁnally have
η = 1 −T<
T>
.
(3.10)
From Eq. (3.10), it is seen that a unit eﬃciency is only possi-
ble if T< = 0, absolute zero.

3.4. IDEAL GAS
41
3.4
Ideal Gas. Isothermal and
Adiabatic Atmospheres
A substance in a gaseous state has the characteristic property
that it ﬁlls the volume of its container regardless of the shape
of the container. In our present discussion the gas in question
is the Earth’s atmosphere, a gas composed approximately of
78% diatomic nitrogen (N2), 21% diatomic oxygen (O2), and
0.93% argon (Ar), along with trace amounts of neon (Ne), he-
lium (He), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), krypton (Kr),
and diatomic hydrogen (H2). We begin by treating “dry air,”
“moist air” referring to the case when a signiﬁcant fraction of
water molecules are present. The eﬀects of moisture will be
discussed in Sec. (3.7).
The equation of state of a gas is the relation that holds be-
tween its pressure, density, and temperature. An ideal gas is
one in which the interaction energy between molecules can be
ignored compared to the molecular kinetic energy. Any gas
becomes ideal at high enough temperature and low enough
density. The Earth’s atmosphere meets these conditions suf-
ﬁciently well that treating it as an ideal gas is a good approx-
imation. The equation of state of an ideal gas is
PV = NmolRT.
(3.11)
In Eq. (3.11), P is the pressure, V is the volume, Nmol is the
number of moles present, T is the absolute temperature, and
R is the ideal gas constant. Its value is R = 8.314 J/mol/K =
8.314×107erg/mol/K. It is also useful to express the gas law
in terms of the mass per unit volume. Let ρmol = Nmol/V be
the number of moles/volume. Then if the gas molecules have
molecular weight Mmol, the mass/volume is ρm = nmolMmol,
and the ideal gas law takes the form
P = ρm
RT
Mmol
.
(3.12)

42
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
For the atmosphere, Mmol = 28.965 g, very close to the molec-
ular weight of the N2 molecule, 28.014 g. The mass density of
air at sea level and T = 15◦C is ρm = 1.225 × 10−3g/c3.
Internal Energy of Ideal Gas
The internal energy of an
ideal gas arises solely from the kinetic energy of the molecules,
which in general can include rotational and vibrational ki-
netic energy in addition to translational kinetic energy. For
a monatomic gas with only translational degrees of freedom,
the internal energy is
U = Nmol(3
2RT).
(3.13)
According to classical thermodynamics, each degree of free-
dom contributes RT/2 to the internal energy. For a monatomic
gas, there are three degrees of freedom, one for each direction
of motion. This explains the factor 3/2 in Eq. (3.13). The at-
mosphere is predominantly composed of diatomic molecules
such as N2 and O2. For such gases at the temperatures in
the atmosphere, rotational kinetic energy must be taken into
account. In addition to their three translational degrees of
freedom, diatomic molecules have two rotational degrees of
freedom,2 each of which contributes an additional RT/2 per
mole to the kinetic energy. For diatomic molecules and air in
particular, we then have
U = Nmol(5
2RT).
(3.14)
Speciﬁc Heats of an Ideal Gas
The speciﬁc heat of any
system is a measure of how much the internal energy changes
per degree of temperature change.
There are two speciﬁc
2Visualizing a diatomic molecule as a dumbbell, the axis of the dumb-
ell can be rotated in two directions.

3.4. IDEAL GAS
43
heats for a gas, denoted as CV and CP , according to whether
the temperature is changed holding volume V or pressure P
constant.
For an ideal gas, the internal energy is given by
U = CV NmolT.
(3.15)
For the case where heat is added to the system at constant
volume, the ﬁrst law reduces to dU = TdS = dQ. The speciﬁc
heat/mole at constant volume is, by deﬁnition,
CV =
1
Nmol
(dQ
dT )V ,
(3.16)
and using dQ = dU along with Eq. (3.15) the speciﬁc heat at
constant volume is
CV =
1
Nmol
(∂U
∂T )V .
(3.17)
So for a monatomic ideal gas, we have
(CV )mono = 3
2R,
(3.18)
while for a diatomic ideal gas, we have
(CV )diatomic = 5
2R.
(3.19)
Experimental values of speciﬁc heats are usually given in
J/kg/K. In these units, the value of CV for dry air at standard
temperature and pressure is 717.1J/kg/K. Dividing 5/2R by
the molecular weight of air (28.965×10−3 kg) gives 717.6J/kg/K,
so air in the atmosphere is behaving as an ideal gas.
The speciﬁc heat/mole at constant pressure for an ideal
gas is related to the speciﬁc heat/mole at constant volume
by the simple formula
CP = CV + R,
(3.20)

44
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
so for air with CV = 5R/2, we have CP = 7R/2. Eq. (3.20)
is easy to derive. The ﬁrst law now reads
dU = TdS −PdV.
(3.21)
The ideal gas law states
P = NmolRT
V
,
(3.22)
so if dP = 0, we have d(T/V ) = 0, which is equivalent to
dT/T = dV/V. Using this, PdV = NmolRdT, so we have
(dQ)P = (TdS)P = dU + NmolRdT
(3.23)
= NmolCP dT = Nmol(CV dT + RdT),
which leads to
CP = CV + R.
(3.24)
For an ideal diatomic gas, the ratio CP /CV is 7/5. The value
of this ratio for dry air at standard conditions is in close
agreement with 7/5, another indication that the atmosphere
is behaving as an ideal gas.
Eﬀects of Gravity on the Atmosphere
The average
properties of the atmosphere as a function of altitude are
remarkably stable despite the attractive force of gravity on
the air molecules.
The reason is that the pressure in the
atmosphere is such that a given slab of air is in mechanical
equilibrium. If z is the altitude, measured from the surface of
the Earth, the equation governing the variation of the pres-
sure is
dP
dz = −ρmg,
(3.25)
where g is the gravitational acceleration. This equation, along
with the ideal gas law, gives us two equations in the three un-
knowns of pressure, temperature, and density. To solve for

3.4. IDEAL GAS
45
all three, another equation is needed. The simplest possibil-
ity, one we will explore in the next section, is to assume the
temperature of the atmosphere is constant as a function of
altitude. More realistic results are obtained by assuming the
atmosphere is adiabatic, a behavior that will be explained
after our treatment of the isothermal atmosphere.
Isothermal Atmosphere
At ﬁrst sight, the assumption
of a constant temperature for the atmosphere seems reason-
able. For example, an observer is more likely to notice “thin
air” (reduced density) than any change in temperature when
traveling 2 km above sea level. But the decrease of tempera-
ture with altitude does become very clear when the altitude
increases by several kilometers. By an altitude of 9 km the
external temperature is approximately 60◦C below the sea
level temperature.
Although ultimately unrealistic, the isothermal atmosphere
is a useful preliminary to the case of an adiabatic atmosphere.
Proceeding, we simplify notation by having ρm →ρ, Mmol →
M, Nmol →N, and, we denote sea level quantities by a sub-
script 0; P0, T0, and ρ0.
For an isothermal process connecting states 0 and 1, for an
ideal gas we have
P1V1 = P0V0,
(3.26)
which is equivalent to
P1ρ−1
1
= P0ρ−1
0 .
(3.27)
Applying this to the atmosphere, we take state 1 to be the
state of the atmosphere at altitude z, while state 0 is the state
of the atmosphere at sea level. Eq. (3.27) becomes
P(z)(ρ(z))−1 = P0ρ−1
0 .
(3.28)

46
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
Using this equation to solve for ρ(z) and substituting the
result in Eq. (3.25) gives
dP(z)
dz
= −Mg ρ0
P0
P(z).
(3.29)
The ideal gas law at sea level is P0 = ρ0RT0, so Eq. (3.29)
becomes
dP
dz = −( Mg
RT0
)P.
(3.30)
The combination RT0/Mg is a characteristic length D0,
D0 ≡RT0/Mg.
(3.31)
Taking T0 = 288 K, Eq. (3.31) gives D0 = 8.43 km.
Eq. (3.30) now reads
dP
dz = −1
D0
P,
(3.32)
so that
P(z) = P0 exp(−z
D0
).
(3.33)
As long as the temperature is constant, the ideal gas law says
that the density and pressure vary with altitude in the same
way, so for the density, we have
ρ(z) = ρ0 exp(−z
D0
).
(3.34)
To summarize, both pressure and density fall exponentially
for the case of an isothermal atmosphere while the tempera-
ture remains at the sea level value. Comparing P(z) calcu-
lated from Eq. (3.33) to actual data at various altitudes, one
ﬁnds that Eq. (3.33) is in good agreement with the data up
to z ∼1 km, but eventually decreases too fast. For example,
at z = 9 km, the pressure calculated from Eq. (3.33) is ∼12%
smaller than the actual pressure at that altitude.

3.4. IDEAL GAS
47
Adiabatic Atmosphere
One reason for favoring an adia-
batic description of the atmosphere is the low heat conductiv-
ity of air; the heat conductivity of air is ∼1/25 that of water,
and ∼1/10, 000 that of copper. The other reason is that the
atmosphere is rarely, if ever, absolutely still. There are con-
tinuous exchanges of parcels of air over various distance and
time scales. The heat conductivity of air is so low that these
exchanges are essentially adiabatic; a negligible amount of
heat is transferred when two small volumes are exchanged.
If states 0 and 1 of an ideal gas are connected by an adia-
batic expansion or compression, their pressures and volumes
are related by
P1V γ
1 = P0V γ
0 .
(3.35)
In Eq. (3.35), γ is the ratio of the speciﬁc heat/mole at con-
stant pressure to the speciﬁc heat/mole at constant volume.3
For diatomic molecules such as N2 and O2, we have
CV = 5
2R, CP = 7
2R,
(3.36)
so γ = 7/5. To derive Eq. (3.35), we note that there is no
heat transfer in an adiabatic process so dS = 0. For a general
process, dS is
dS = 1
T (dU + PdV ).
(3.37)
For an ideal gas, this expression can be transformed into
dS = N[CP
dV
V
+ CV
dP
P ].
(3.38)
Setting dS = 0, we have
CP

P = 0,

48
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
which is equivalent to the usual form of the adiabatic law,
PV γ = const.
(3.40)
Adapting Eq. (3.35) to the atmosphere, we can relate the
pressure and density at altitude z to their sea level values.
Eq. (3.35) is equivalent to
P(z)ρ(z)−γ = P0ρ−γ
0 .
(3.41)
Solving for ρ(z),
ρ(z) = ρ0(P(z)
P0
)1/γ.
(3.42)
Using this expression for ρ, Eq. (3.25) now involves only the
pressure P and the altitude z. Skipping some elementary
steps, the solution for the pressure is
P(z) = P0(1 −(γ −1
γ
)ρ0gz
P0

γ

(3.43)
Since γ = 7/5, we have
γ −1
γ

Using the ideal gas law, we have

(3.44)
Our expression for the pressure at altitude z in an adiabatic
atmosphere becomes
P(z) = P0(1 −2

(3.45)

3.4. IDEAL GAS
49
Having found the pressure as a function of altitude, let us
ﬁnd the temperature. First, we use the ideal gas law to solve
for the density. This gives
ρ(z) = P(z)M
RT(z) .
(3.46)
Substituting for ρ in Eq. (3.41) and canceling constant factors,
we arrive at
P(z)1−γ
T(z)−γ = P 1−γ

T −γ

(3.47)
or
T(z)
T0

(3.48)
Using Eq. (3.45) to substitute for P(z)/P0, we ﬁnally obtain
T(z) = T0((1 −(γ −1
γ
)ρ0gz
P0
).
(3.49)
Substituting for γ and D0, we have
T(z) = T0(1 −2
7
z
D0
).
(3.50)
We see that the temperature decreases linearly with altitude
in an adiabatic atmosphere. At ﬁrst sight it is worrisome that
Eqs. (3.45) and (3.50) predict zeroes in pressure and temper-
ature at z = 7D0/2. However, this altitude is well above the
troposphere, and into the next layer of the atmosphere, the
stratosphere, where additional factors come into play.
Lapse Rate
Remaining in the troposphere, Eq. (3.50) pre-
dicts a deﬁnite value for the “lapse rate,” Γ, which is
Γ ≡dT
dz .
(3.51)

50
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
Using Eqs. (3.31) and (3.50), we have
Γ = −(γ −1
γ
)Mg
R .
(3.52)
Using the deﬁnitions of CP , CV , and γ, Γ becomes the very
simple expression,
Γ = −Mg
CP
.
(3.53)
This expression for Γ, which is known as the “dry air lapse
rate,” is the ratio of the force of gravity on a mole of air,
divided by the speciﬁc heat/mole at constant pressure. Its
numerical value is −9.8 K/km, so an increase in altitude of
1 km will be accompanied by a decrease in temperature of
9.8 K. While this is accurate for dry air, the actual air in the
atmosphere is rarely completely dry. The presence of water
vapor in the atmosphere has a large eﬀect on the lapse rate,
generally reducing it from the dry air lapse rate to around
6 K/km. The treatment of an adiabatic atmosphere contain-
ing water vapor is a more complex subject which is treated
in Sec. (3.7). The lapse rate is closely related to D0. From
Eqs. (3.31) and (3.53), we have
Γ = T0
γD0
.
(3.54)
From the adiabatic formula for pressure, Eq. (3.45), we
have P/P0 = 0.58 at z = D0/2, and P/P0 = 0.31 at z = D0.
At smaller values of z, the adiabatic formula approaches the
isothermal formula for pressure. Again, the adiabatic formula
for pressure, as expressed in Eq. (3.45), is a dry air formula.
The atmospheres over a desert or a snowﬁeld are examples of
places where it would hold.

3.5. CHEMICAL POTENTIAL

3.5
Chemical Potential. Thermodynamic
Potentials
Chemical Potential
The cases discussed so far are those
of a gas with a ﬁxed number of particles. Thermodynamics
applies to the more general case when the number of parti-
cles is varied. The corresponding intensive variable is called
the “chemical potential” and is usually denoted as µ. If more
than one type of molecule is present, each type i has its own
chemical potential, µi. In the atmosphere there are separate
chemical potentials for N2, O2, H2O, etc. The chemical po-
tential plays a central role when particle exchange is present.
For the physics of the atmosphere, the transition of water
molecules from liquid to vapor forms is the most important
example.
Thermodynamic Potentials
We now have all the ther-
modynamic state variables needed to express the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics in its most general form:
dU = TdS −PdV +
X
i
µidNi.
(3.55)
This says that the small change in the internal energy of the
gas is the sum of the heat absorbed, minus the work done,
plus the extra energy derived from adding particles. In what
follows, Ni is the number of moles of molecule i, so µi is
the chemical potential/mole for species i. Eq. (3.55) is a true
diﬀerential, meaning that the internal energy is a function of
the entropy, the volume, and the Ni, with
(∂U
∂S )V,Ni = T, (∂U
∂V )S,Ni = −P, ( ∂U
∂Ni
)S,V = µi.
(3.56)
An important result (Callen 1960) for the internal energy is
the Gibbs-Duhem relation, which is an explicit formula for

52
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
the internal energy:
U = TS −PV +
X
i
µiNi.
(3.57)
Eq. (3.57) follows from the extensive property of the internal
energy.
If the internal energy is known as a function of S, V, and
the Ni, complete thermodynamic information is available.
However, this form is inconvenient for relating to measur-
able quantities. Temperature and pressure are preferable to
their extensive counterparts, entropy and volume. The two
forms of “free energy” known as the Helmholtz free energy
and the Gibbs free energy are quantities closely related to
the internal energy, in which one or more extensive variables
have been traded for their corresponding intensive variables.
Consider ﬁrst the Helmholtz free energy, deﬁned by
F ≡U −TS.
(3.58)
It is easy to show (Callen 1960) that F is a function of tem-
perature, pressure and the Ni. In terms of F(T, V, Ni), the
ﬁrst law takes the form
dF = −SdT −PdV +
X
i
µidNi.
(3.59)
For a process which takes place at constant temperature and
constant Ni, the Helmholtz free energy changes only when the
system does work or is worked upon, so at constant temper-
ature and Ni, F is independent of the ﬂow of heat in and out
of the system. From the Gibbs-Duhem relation, Eq. (3.57)
and Eq. (3.58), F is given in explicit form as
F = −PV +
X
i
µiNi.
(3.60)

3.5. CHEMICAL POTENTIAL
53
The Gibbs free energy takes the process of trading exten-
sive variables for intensive variable one step further.
It is
deﬁned by
G = U −TS + PV = F + PV.
(3.61)
Again using the Gibbs-Duhem relation, G is given explicitly
by
G =
X
i
µiNi.

The Gibbs free energy is a function of T, P, and the Ni. The
ﬁrst law, when expressed in terms of G, is
dG = −SdT + V dP +
X
i
µidNi.
(3.63)
For a process at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs
free energy changes only when there is particle exchange. At
constant T and P, the Gibbs free energy is independent of
both the heat ﬂowing in and out of the system and the work
done by or on the system. The Gibbs free energy is partic-
ularly useful in cases where a gas is in equilibrium with its
liquid form, the most important example being water vapor
in equilibrium with its liquid form in the atmosphere.
Let us return to the case where there is only one type of
molecule present. Then Eq. (3.62) reduces to
G = µN.
(3.64)
Deﬁning the Gibbs free energy per mole as g ≡G/N, we see
that g is just the chemical potential, µ,
g(T, P) = G
N = µ(T, P).
(3.65)
Now
dG = −SdT + V dP + gdN = dgN + gdN.

Demanding that the terms on the right side of Eq. (3.66) agree

so the derivatives of the Gibbs free energy per mole determine
the entropy and volume per mole.
3.6
The Boundary between Phases
A given substance can exist in diﬀerent forms or phases, the
most familiar example being water, which can be in gaseous,
liquid, or solid form. In this section, we will ﬁrst treat the
generic case of a liquid in mechanical and thermal equilibrium
with its vapor, and then go on to the particular application
considered by Fermi of liquid water in equilibrium with its
vapor. We denote the liquid as system 1 and the vapor as
system 2.
Thermal equilibrium between 1 and 2 requires
that T1 = T2, while mechanical equilibrium demands that
P1 = P2, so we have a common temperature and pressure
denoted from now on by T and P. Similarly the chemical po-
tentials of the two phases must be equal since an inequality
between µ1 and µ2 would lead to a net ﬂow of particles from
the system of higher chemical potential into the one of lower
chemical potential. Thus the system is only in complete equi-
librium when the three intensive variables, T, P, µ, take the
same values in the two systems.
It is important to realize that although the chemical po-
tential is the same throughout the entire system, g1(T, P)
and g2(T, P) are diﬀerent functions, describing respectively
the thermodynamic properties of the vapor and of the liquid.
This point is illustrated by considering the volume per mole

3.6. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN PHASES
55
in the two phases. The vapor is certainly less dense than the
liquid, so v1 > v2. Using Eq. (3.68), we have
v1 = ∂g1(T, P)
∂P
> v2 = ∂g2(T, P)
∂P
.
(3.69)
It is clear from Eq. (3.69) that g1(T, P) and g2(T, P) must be
diﬀerent functions. The same conclusion follows from consid-
ering the entropy per mole. From a geometric point of view,
we can visualize either g1 or g2 as a surface, g1 and g2 being
the heights above the T, P plane. The physical requirement
that g1 = g2 can only be realized along the curve where the
surfaces intersect. This means that for a vapor-liquid system
to be in equilibrium, only one of T and P can be chosen freely
so that if T is chosen, requiring that g1(T, P) = g2(T, P) will
determine the pressure. An equation for the coexistence curve
follows from writing out dg1(T, P) = dg2(T, P):
dg1 = ∂g1(T, P)
∂T
dT + ∂g1(T, P)
∂P
dP =
(3.70)
dg2 = ∂g2(T, P)
∂T
dT + ∂g2(T, P)
∂P
dP
Using Eqs. (3.67) and (3.68), Eq. (3.70) is equivalent to
s1dT + v1dP = s2dT + v2dP.
(3.71)
Solving for the derivative along the coexistence curve, we have
dP
dT = s1 −s2
v1 −v2
.
(3.72)
This equation can be put into a more useful form by recast-
ing it in terms of sg and sl, the entropies per unit mass of
the vapor and liquid, respectively, and likewise vg and vl,
the volumes per unit mass of the vapor and liquid. If the

56
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
molecules in the system have molar mass M, then sl = s1/M,
sg = s2/M, and vl = v1/M, vg = v2/M. Using this notation,
Eq. (3.72) becomes
dP
dT = sg −sl
vg −vl
.
(3.73)
The heat required to vaporize a unit mass of liquid is called
the latent heat4 and is denoted by Fermi as λ. It is deﬁned
by
λ ≡T(sg −sl).
(3.74)
In terms of the latent heat, Eq. (3.73) becomes
dP
dT =
λ
T(vg −vl).
(3.75)
Eq. (3.75) is usually known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equa-
tion, or sometimes simply as the Clapeyron equation, Clapey-
ron’s work having predated that of Clausius by a number of
years.
Fig. (3.1) shows a portion of the pressure vs.
tempera-
ture coexistence curve between liquid water and its vapor.
It is clear from the graph that lower pressure means lower
boiling temperature, a fact familiar to mountain dwellers. It
should also be mentioned that if the graph were extended
to much higher temperatures and pressures, the coexistence
curve would end in what is known as a “critical point,” Tc =
374◦C, Pc = 218 atm. By taking the system on a continuous
path around this point, liquid water can be transformed into
water vapor with no latent heat.
Assuming the vapor obeys the ideal gas law, we have
Pvg = RT
M ,
(3.76)
4The latent heat is denoted as L by other authors.

Since
vapors are generally much less dense than liquids, it is rea-
sonable to ignore vl compared to vg in Eq. (3.75). This gives
dP

(3.77)
Eliminating vg using Eq. (3.76), we obtain

(3.78)
or

(3.79)
We can integrate this equation if we ignore the rather modest
variation with temperature of the latent heat. Specializing to
the case of water, we will take the latent heat to be constant
and equal to its value at 100◦C, λw = 540 cal/g = 2, 260 J/g.
Doing this, and adjusting the constant of integration so that

58
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
atmospheric pressure is obtained5 at T = 100◦C = 373 K, we
ﬁnd
P(T) = Patm exp(13.1 −4, 893
T
),
(3.80)
where T is in kelvins. This simple formula is a reasonable
approximation to the accurate data plotted in Fig. (3.1).
Since the Clausius-Clapeyron equation applies generally to
phase transitions, it is interesting to also consider its predic-
tion for the phase change from ice to water.
Whereas we
saw earlier that v2 ≫v1, in this case v2 = 1.00 cm3/g is less
then v1 ≈1.09 cm3/g. In other words, ice ﬂoats on water, an
anomaly because the solid phase is usually denser than the
liquid phase. Moreover, since the diﬀerence in volume per
gram is orders of magnitude smaller than it is for the vapor
to liquid transition, dP/dT is orders of magnitude larger and
conversely dT/dP is orders of magnitude smaller.
Even though dT/dP is relatively small for the water-ice
transition, it can play an important role in glacier ﬂow since
ice encountering a rock-like obstacle experiences a consequent
increase in pressure. It may then melt because the negative
sign of (v2 −v1) implies that dT/dP is also negative. The ice
will refreeze almost immediately, but its temporary melting
may aid the glacier to slide around the obstacle.

Adiabatic Transformation of
Moist Air
An adiabatic transformation for dry air obeys Eq. (3.40). Tak-
ing the ratio of speciﬁc heats for air to be 7/5, and using the
5Kelvins means temperature with respect to absolute zero. The re-
lation between Celsius temperature TC and and Kelvin temperature TK
is TK = TC + 273.

(3.81)
In the presence of moisture, all three of these diﬀerential re-
lations will be modiﬁed. In this section of his notes, Fermi
focuses on the last one, involving dP/dT. Before presenting
the way in which that relation is modiﬁed, it is certainly in
Fermi’s spirit to ask what is the qualitative expectation; does
7/2 get replaced by a larger or a smaller factor? To answer
this, consider an adiabatic expansion of a dry ideal gas. Both
the pressure and temperature decrease. Now if moisture is
also present in form of water vapor, lowering the pressure
slightly will generally lead to a small amount of condensa-
tion, and the release of a small amount of latent heat into the
surrounding gas. This will make the decrease in temperature,
dT, smaller in magnitude than it was before. Looking back
at the last relation in Eq. (3.81), we then expect 7/2 to be
replaced by a larger number.
The formula derived by Fermi involves two dimensionless
ratios which we give the symbols α and β. If λ is the latent
heat of water, and Mv is the molecular weight of water, then
α ≡λMv
RT .
(3.82)
This combination ﬁrst appeared in discussing the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation. See Eq. (3.79). If Pv is the vapor pres-
sure of water at the chosen conditions, and P is the total
pressure, then
β ≡Pv
P .
(3.83)

60
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
As a numerical example, suppose the temperature is 20◦C=
293 K, a typical temperature for a humid summer day. Then
α =
(2260 J/g) · (18 g)
(8.314 J/mol K) · (293 K) = 16.7.
(3.84)
For β, the partial pressure of water vapor at 20◦C is 17.5 mmHg.
Dividing by atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg we ﬁnd
β = 17.5
760 = 2.3 × 10−2.
(3.85)
So β is small, and it is valid to ignore β compared to 1.
Fermi also makes this approximation. The parameter α is
considerably larger than 1, but it always appears as either
αβ or α2β. For the conditions just stated, αβ = 0.38, and
α2β = 6.4, so α2β is very signiﬁcant and in fact dominates
the ﬁnal result.
Fermi’s formula,6 with α2β = 0.38 and αβ = 16.7, gives

= 7.17,
(3.86)
so the dry air result of 7/2 is indeed increased by condensation
of water vapor, by a rather large factor!
Derivation of Fermi’s Formula
We are interested in an
adiabatic process in moist air; dry air plus water vapor. What
is adiabatic for the moist air as a whole is not adiabatic for
the dry air. The dry air picks up latent heat when water va-
por condenses (or gives it up when liquid water evaporates).
Applying the ﬁrst law to the dry air provides a direct route to
6Fermi makes a rare algebraic error on page 4B of his notes, inverting
numerator and denominator on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.86).

3.7. MOIST AIR
61
Fermi’s formula. We will use a subscript a for dry air quan-
tities, and a subscript v for water vapor quantities. Writing
the ﬁrst law in the form given in Eq. (3.5) for dry air gives
dUa = TdSa −PadV.
(3.87)
Dry air is treated as an ideal gas which obtains its heat in-
put or output solely from vapor condensation or evaporation.
Explicitly, Eq. (3.87) becomes
5
2NaRdT = −λMvdNv −NaRT
V
dV,
(3.88)
where Na and Nv are mole numbers for dry air and vapor.
It is worth remarking on the sign of the ﬁrst term. Suppose
there is condensation, so dNv < 0. The minus sign in front
of this term ensures that the resulting latent heat is added
to the dry air when vapor condenses. Dividing Eq. (3.88) by
NaRT gives

(3.89)
Since the number of dry air moles is not changing,
dNv/Na = d(Nv/Na).
Further, since both dry air and vapor are assumed to be ideal
gases, we have d(Nv/Na) = d(Pv/Pa). Rearranging the terms
in Eq. (3.89) results in

At this point it is convenient to express things in terms of α
and β. The total pressure of the moist air is P = Pa + Pv =
Pa + βP, so Pa = (1 −β)P. Since β is quite small, it is a
good approximation to follow Fermi and replace Pa with P;
Pv/Pa ≈Pv/P. Doing so, we get

3.9. TEMPERATURE VS. ALTITUDE
63
The dominant eﬀect in the modiﬁcation of 7/2 to a bigger
number is the large latent heat of water. The water vapor
plays a small role in the pressure and internal energy of moist
air. However, the condensation of vapor releases the latent
heat into the surrounding gas and signiﬁcantly aﬀects the
adiabatic law which holds for dry air.
3.8
Atmospheric Composition and Temperature
As mentioned in Sec. (3.4), the dominant components of the
lower atmosphere are the diatomic molecules of nitrogen and
oxygen, by volume respectively 78.08% and 20.95% of the
atmosphere at sea level, 15◦C and atmospheric pressure of
101, 325 Pa = 1 atm. Argon, at 0.93%, constitutes the ma-
jority of the remainder. The fourth-largest constituent, one
that has drawn increasing focus because of its eﬀect on global
warming, is carbon dioxide, at 0.033%. With the exception of
neon, at 0.0018%, no other gas rises to the level of parts per
thousand. Nevertheless two other gases in the atmosphere
have drawn public attention: methane because of its eﬀect
on global warming, and ozone because of its dual eﬀect as
a greenhouse gas at levels up to about 10 km, in the tro-
posphere, and as a protector against ultraviolet radiation at
higher levels (in the stratosphere).
In addition the atmo-
sphere contains a variable amount of water vapor, ranging
from trace amounts to as high as 4–5%.
3.9
Temperature as a Function of Altitude
As we see in Fig. (3.2), the temperature of the atmosphere de-
creases linearly as a function of altitude up to approximately
10 km above sea level. As discussed in Sec. (3.4), linear de-

64
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
crease of temperature with altitude occurs in a dry adiabatic
atmosphere, but the rate of decrease in the actual atmosphere
is smaller than it would be in dry air. At an altitude of 10 km,
the temperature has dropped to approximately −50◦C.
Leaving the troposphere one enters the stratosphere, a re-
gion in which the ozone molecule (O3) plays an important
role both in heating its surroundings and in protecting the
Earth against the harmful eﬀects of solar ultraviolet radia-
tion. The temperature above the troposphere rises slowly at
ﬁrst in the region known as the tropopause and then more
rapidly, reaching a peak of 50◦C at 50 to 60 km above sea
level. The stratosphere is known to be very dry and to have
little convection, which in turn implies little turbulence, a
distinct advantage for aviation. This stability may, however,
be disturbed by volcanic eruptions or thunderstorms. Above
the stratosphere the temperature begins once again to drop.
The heating of the stratosphere is largely due to ultraviolet
solar radiation operating in a process known as photolysis
during which its ozone is rapidly destroyed and recreated in
a cyclical manner. It begins with an oxygen molecule (O2)
in the stratosphere being split into two oxygen atoms by the
absorption of ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength λ ≤
242 nm. An oxygen atom (O) then combines with an oxygen
molecule to form an ozone molecule (O3): during this process
energy is released that is transformed into heat. The ozone
molecule is then rapidly disassociated by lower-energy solar
radiation (λ ≤320 nm), and the cycle begins anew. In brief,
solar ultraviolet radiation is the source of the heating.
This important layer of ozone, the protector from the harm-
ful eﬀects of ultraviolet radiation, can be partially destroyed
by the catalytic action of other molecules in the stratosphere.
Chloroﬂuorocarbons are a well-known example. The action
of photolysis on them releases chlorine atoms (Cl) which com-

bine with ozone ( O3 )to form ClO + O2. The ClO molecules
then interact with an oxygen atom, ClO + O →Cl + O2, and
chlorine is free again to bond with ozone. In other words,
chlorine is a very eﬀective catalyst for the destruction of
ozone.

Exotic Phenomena in the
Upper Atmosphere
Twilight: The Earth’s lower atmosphere is illuminated even
when the Sun is below the horizon because of sunlight being
scattered by dust particles in the upper atmosphere.
The
phenomenon occurs both near dusk and near dawn.

66
CHAPTER 3. HEAT AND THE ATMOSPHERE
Luminous Clouds:
Also known as noctilucent clouds, these
are caused by sunlight being scattered by ice crystals in the
mesosphere. They are too faint to be seen other than during
twilight.
Zodiacal Light:
This is a diﬀuse light around the Sun
caused by the scattering of sunlight by dust in the zodiac
or ecliptic, the apparent path in the celestial sphere swept
out by the Earth during the course of the year.
Note: There are other notable sources of transitory phe-
nomena of dust in the atmosphere that aﬀect sunlight, such
as volcanic eruptions or the passage and subsequent breakup
of meteors entering the atmosphere. A discussion of addi-
tional phenomena caused by electromagnetic radiation such
as auroras is postponed until Chap. (17).
