Pauli Spin Matrices
systems with spin S > 0, whereas the normal Zeeman effect governs atoms with
a total S = 0, the Paschen–Back effect could be understood as a decoupling of S
and orbital angular momentum L, since the inﬂuence of the total spin becomes
neglectable for diminishing spin-orbit coupling. (See also  Russell–Saunders cou-
pling,  jj-coupling, Stern–Gerlach experiment and  vector model).

Pauli Spin Matrices
Roderich Tumulka
The Pauli spin matrices are the following 3 complex 2 × 2 matrices:
σx =
0 1
1 0

,
σy =
0 −i
i 0

,
σz =
1 0
0 −1

.

These matrices represent the spin observables along the x- (respective y- and z-)axis
of physical 3-space for a spin- 1
2 particle, relative to an  orthonormal basis of spin
space consisting of eigenvectors of σz. (Spin observables are measured, e.g., in the
 Stern–Gerlach experiment.) The spin observable along any direction in physical
3-space deﬁned by the unit vector n = (nx, ny, nz) is given, relative to the same
basis, by
σn = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz = n · σ
(2)
with σ = (σx, σy, σz). The spin observable is related to the angular momentum
observable Jn along n according to
Jn = ℏ
2 σn + Ln,
