Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised
learning method for the lexical acquisition of words related
to places visited by robots, from human continuous speech
signals. We address the problem of learning novel words by
a robot that has no prior knowledge of these words except
for a primitive acoustic model. Further, we propose a method
that allows a robot to effectively use the learned words and
their meanings for self-localization tasks. The proposed method
is nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition method
(SpCoA) that integrates the generative model for self-localization
and the unsupervised word segmentation in uttered sentences via
latent variables related to the spatial concept. We implemented
the proposed method SpCoA on SIGVerse, which is a simulation
environment, and TurtleBot 2, which is a mobile robot in a real
environment. Further, we conducted experiments for evaluating
the performance of SpCoA. The experimental results showed
that SpCoA enabled the robot to acquire the names of places
from speech sentences. They also revealed that the robot could
effectively utilize the acquired spatial concepts and reduce the
uncertainty in self-localization.

I. INTRODUCTION
A
UTONOMOUS robots, such as service robots, operating
in the human living environment with humans have to
be able to perform various tasks and language communication.
To this end, robots are required to acquire novel concepts
and vocabulary on the basis of the information obtained from
their sensors, e.g., laser sensors, microphones, and cameras,
and recognize a variety of objects, places, and situations in
an ambient environment. Above all, we consider it important
for the robot to learn the names that humans associate with
places in the environment and the spatial areas corresponding
to these names; i.e., the robot has to be able to understand
words related to places. Therefore, it is important to deal with
considerable uncertainty, such as the robot’s movement errors,
sensor noise, and speech recognition errors.
Several studies on language acquisition by robots have
assumed that robots have no prior lexical knowledge. These
studies differ from speech recognition studies based on a large
vocabulary and natural language processing studies based on
lexical, syntactic, and semantic knowledge [1], [2]. Studies on

language acquisition by robots also constitute a constructive
approach to the human developmental process and the emer-
gence of symbols.
The objectives of this study were to build a robot that learns
words related to places and efﬁciently utilizes this learned
vocabulary in self-localization. Lexical acquisition related to
places is expected to enable a robot to improve its spatial

cognition. A schematic representation depicting the target task
of this study is shown in Fig. 1. This study assumes that
a robot does not have any vocabularies in advance but can
recognize syllables or phonemes. The robot then performs
self-localization while moving around in the environment, as
shown in Fig. 1 (a). An utterer speaks a sentence including
the name of the place to the robot, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). For
the purposes of this study, we need to consider the problems
of self-localization and lexical acquisition simultaneously.
When a robot learns novel words from utterances, it is
difﬁcult to determine segmentation boundaries and the identity
of different phoneme sequences from the speech recognition
results, which can lead to errors. First, let us consider the case
of the lexical acquisition of an isolated word. For example, if a
robot obtains the speech recognition results “aporu”, “epou”,
and “aqpuru” (incorrect phoneme recognition of apple), it
is difﬁcult for the robot to determine whether they denote the
same referent without prior knowledge. Second, let us consider
a case of the lexical acquisition of the utterance of a sentence.
For example, a robot obtains a speech recognition result, such
as “thisizanaporu.” The robot has to necessarily segment a
sentence into individual words, e.g., “this”, “iz”, “an”, and
“aporu”. In addition, it is necessary for the robot to recognize
words referring to the same referent, e.g., the fruit apple,
from among the many segmented results that contain errors. In
case of Fig. 1 (c), there is some possibility of learning names
including phoneme errors, e.g., “afroqtabutibe,” because the
robot does not have any lexical knowledge.
On the other hand, when a robot performs online probabilis-
tic self-localization, we assume that the robot uses sensor data
and control data, e.g., values obtained using a range sensor
and odometry. If the position of the robot on the global map
is unclear, the difﬁculties associated with the identiﬁcation
of the self-position by only using local sensor information
become problematic. In the case of global localization using
local information, e.g., a range sensor, the problem that
the hypothesis of self-position is present in multiple remote
locations, frequently occurs, as shown in Fig. 1 (d).
In order to solve the abovementioned problems, in this
study, we adopted the following approach. An utterance is
recognized as not a single phoneme sequence but a set of
candidates of multiple phonemes. We attempt to suppress the
variability in the speech recognition results by performing
word discovery taking into account the multiple candidates
of speech recognition. In addition, the names of places are
learned by associating with words and positions. The lexical
acquisition is complemented by using certain particular spatial
information; i.e., this information is obtained by hearing utter-
ances including the same word in the same place many times.
Furthermore, in this study, we attempt to address the problem
of the uncertainty of self-localization by improving the self-
position errors by using a recognized utterance including the
name of the current place and the acquired spatial concepts,
as shown in Fig. 1 (e).
In this paper, we propose nonparametric Bayesian spatial
concept acquisition method (SpCoA) on basis of unsupervised
word segmentation and a nonparametric Bayesian generative
model that integrates self-localization and a clustering in both
words and places. The main contributions of this paper are as
follows:
• We have proposed a learning method for spatial concepts
that can perform the lexical acquisition related to places,
i.e., the names of places, from a continuous speech signal
in an unsupervised manner.
• We have achieved relatively accurate lexical acquisition
that reduced the variability and errors in phonemes by
performing word discovery using the multiple candidates
of the speech recognition results, i.e., by using a lattice
format.
• In addition to the general self-localization method of
mobile robots, we showed that self-localization by the
proposed method can reduce the uncertainty of self-
position by utilizing the learned spatial concepts and an
uttered sentence about the current position.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section II, previous studies on language acquisition and lexical
acquisition relevant to our study are described. In Section III,
the proposed method SpCoA is presented. In Sections IV and
V, we discuss the effectiveness of SpCoA in the simulation
and in the real environment. Section VI concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Lexical acquisition
Most studies on lexical acquisition typically focus on lexi-
cons about objects [1], [3]–[11]. Many of these studies have
not be able to address the lexical acquisition of words other
than those related to objects, e.g., words about places.
Roy et al. proposed a computational model that enables
a robot to learn the names of objects from an object im-
age and spontaneous infant-directed speech [1]. Their results
showed that the model performed speech segmentation, word
discovery, and visual categorization. Iwahashi et al. reported
that a robot properly understands the situation and acquires
the relationship of object behaviors and sentences [3]–[5]. Qu
& Chai focused on the conjunction between speech and eye
gaze and the use of domain knowledge in lexical acquisition
[7], [8]. They proposed an unsupervised learning method that
automatically acquires novel words for an interactive system.
Qu & Chai’s method based on the IBM translation model [12]
estimates the word-entity association probability.
Nakamura et al. proposed a method to learn object concepts
and word meanings from multimodal information and verbal
information [10]. The method proposed in [10] is a categoriza-
tion method based on multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation
(MLDA) that enables the acquisition of object concepts from
multimodal information, such as visual, auditory, and haptic
information [13]. Araki et al. addressed the development of
a method combining unsupervised word segmentation from
uttered sentences by a nested Pitman-Yor language model
(NPYLM) [14] and the learning of object concepts by MLDA
[11]. However, the disadvantage of using NPYLM was that
phoneme sequences with errors did not result in appropriate
word segmentation.
These studies did not address the lexical acquisition of
the space and place that can also tolerate the uncertainty of

3
phoneme recognition. However, for the introduction of robots
into the human living environment, robots need to acquire a
lexicon related to not only objects but also places. Our study
focuses on the lexical acquisition related to places. Robots can
adaptively learn the names of places in various human living
environments by using SpCoA. We consider that the acquired
names of places can be useful for various tasks, e.g., tasks
with a movement of robots by the speech instruction.
B. Simultaneous learning of places and vocabulary
The following studies have addressed lexical acquisition
related to places. However, these studies could not utilize the
learned language knowledge in other estimations such as the
self-localization of a robot.
Taguchi et al. proposed a method for the unsupervised
learning of phoneme sequences and relationships between
words and objects from various user utterances without any
prior linguistic knowledge other than an acoustic model of
phonemes [2], [15]. Further, they proposed a method for the
simultaneous categorization of self-position coordinates and
lexical learning [16]. These experimental results showed that
it was possible to learn the name of a place from utterances
in some cases and to output words corresponding to places in
a location that was not used for learning.
Milford et al. proposed RatSLAM inspired by the biological
knowledge of a pose cell of the hippocampus of rodents [17].
Milford et al. proposed a method that enables a robot to
acquire spatial concepts by using RatSLAM [18]. Further,
Lingodroids, mobile robots that learn a language through
robot-to-robot communication, have been studied [19]–[21].
Here, a robot communicated the name of a place to other
robots at various locations. Experimental results showed that
two robots acquired the lexicon of places that they had in
common. In [21], the researchers showed that it was possible
to learn temporal concepts in a manner analogous to the
acquisition of spatial concepts. These studies reported that the
robots created their own vocabulary. However, these studies
did not consider the acquisition of a lexicon by human-to-
robot speech interactions.
Welke et al. proposed a method that acquires spatial rep-
resentation by the integration of the representation of the
continuous state space on the sensorimotor level and the
discrete symbolic entities used in high-level reasoning [22].
This method estimates the probable spatial domain and word
from the given objects by using the spatial lexical knowledge
extracted from Google Corpus and the position information
of the object. Their study is different from ours because their
study did not consider lexicon learning from human speech.
In the case of global localization, the hypothesis of self-
position often remains in multiple remote places. In this
case, there is some possibility of performing an incorrect
estimation and increasing the estimation error. This problem
exists during teaching tasks and self-localization after the
lexical acquisition. The abovementioned studies could not deal
with this problem. In this paper, we have proposed a method
that enables a robot to perform more accurate self-localization
by reducing the estimation error of the teaching time by using
a smoothing method in the teaching task and by utilizing words
acquired through the lexical acquisition. The strengths of this
study are that learning of spatial concept and self-localization
represented as one generative model and robots are able to
utilize acquired lexicon to self-localization autonomously.
III. SPATIAL CONCEPT ACQUISITION
We propose nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept ac-
quisition method (SpCoA) that integrates a nonparametric
morphological analyzer for the lattice [23], i.e., latticelm1, a
spatial clustering method, and Monte Carlo localization (MCL)
[24].
A. Generative model
In our study, we deﬁne a position as a speciﬁc coordinate or
a local point in the environment, and the position distribution
as the spatial area of the environment. Further, we deﬁne
a spatial concept as the names of places and the position
distributions corresponding to these names.
The model that was developed for spatial concept acquisi-
tion is a probabilistic generative model that integrates a self-
localization with the simultaneous clustering of places and
words. Fig. 2 shows the graphical model for spatial concept
acquisition. Table I shows each variable of the graphical
model. The number of words in a sentence at time t is denoted
as Bt. The generative model of the proposed method is deﬁned
as equation (1-10).

and the sensor model of self-localization are denoted as p(xt |

Fig. 2. Graphical model of the proposed method SpCoA
This model can learn an appropriate number of spatial
concepts, depending on the data, by using a nonparametric
Bayesian approach. We use the SBP, which is one of the
methods based on the Dirichlet process. In particular, this
model can consider a theoretically inﬁnite number of spatial
concepts L →∞and position distributions K →∞. SBP
computations are difﬁcult because they generate an inﬁnite
number of parameters. In this study, we approximate a number
of parameters by setting sufﬁciently large values, i.e., a weak-
limit approximation [26].
It is possible to correlate a name with multiple places, e.g.,
“staircase” is in two different places, and a place with multiple
names, e.g., “toilet” and “restroom” refer to the same place.
Spatial concepts are represented by a word distribution of the
names of the place Wl and several position distributions (µk,
Σk) indicated by a multinomial distribution φl. In other words,
this model is capable of relating the mixture of Gaussian
distributions to a multinomial distribution of the names of
places. It should be noted that the arrows connecting it to the
surrounding nodes of the proposed graphical model differ from
those of ordinal Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We assume
that words obtained by the robot do not change its position,
but that the position of the robot affects the distribution of
words. Therefore, the proposed generative process assumes
that the index of position distribution it, i.e., the category of
the place, is generated from the position of the robot xt. This
change can be naturally introduced without any troubles by
introducing equation (11).
B. Overview of the proposed method SpCoA
We assume that a robot performs self-localization by using
control data and sensor data at all times. The procedure for
the learning of spatial concepts is as follows:
1) An utterer teaches a robot the names of places, as shown
in Fig. 1 (b). Every time the robot arrives at a place
that was a designated learning target, the utterer says a
sentence, including the name of the current place.
2) The robot performs speech recognition from the uttered
speech signal data. Thus, the speech recognition system

The speech recognition results are obtained in a lattice
format.
3) Word segmentation is performed by using the lattices of
the speech recognition results.
4) The robot learns spatial concepts from words obtained
by word segmentation and robot positions obtained by
self-localization for all teaching times. The details of the
learning are given in III-C.
The procedure for self-localization utilizing spatial concepts
is as follows:
1) The words of the learned spatial concepts are registered
to the word dictionary of the speech recognition system.
2) When a robot obtains a speech signal, speech recognition
is performed. Then, a word sequence as the 1-best
speech recognition result is obtained.
3) The robot modiﬁes the self-localization from words
obtained by speech recognition and the position like-
lihood obtained by spatial concepts. The details of self-
localization are provided in III-D.
The proposed method can learn words related to places
from the utterances of sentences. We use an unsupervised
word segmentation method latticelm that can directly segment
words from the lattices of the speech recognition results of
the uttered sentences [23]. The lattice can represent to a
compact the set of more promising hypotheses of a speech
recognition result, such as N-best, in a directed graph format.
Unsupervised word segmentation using the lattices of syllable
recognition is expected to be able to reduce the variability and
errors in phonemes as compared to NPYLM [14], i.e., word
segmentation using the 1-best speech recognition results.
The self-localization method adopts MCL [24], a method
that is generally used as the localization of mobile robots
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) [27]. We

5
assume that a robot generates an environment map by using
MCL-based SLAM such as FastSLAM [28], [29] in advance,
and then, performs localization by using the generated map.
Then, the environment map of both an occupancy grid map
and a landmark map is acceptable.
C. Learning of spatial concept
Spatial concepts are learned from multiple teaching data,
control data, and sensor data. The teaching data are a set
of uttered sentences for all teaching times. Segmented words
of an uttered sentence are converted into a bag-of-words
(BoW) representation as a vector of the occurrence counts
of words Ot,B. The set of the teaching times is denoted
as To = {t1, t2, . . . , tN}, and the number of teaching data
items is denoted as N. The model parameters are denoted
as Θ = {W, µ, Σ, φl, π}. The initial values of the model
parameters can be set arbitrarily in accordance with a con-
dition. Further, the sampling values of the model parameters
from the following joint posterior distribution are obtained by
performing Gibbs sampling.
p(x0:T , iTo, CTo, Θ | OTo,B, u1:T , z1:T , h)
(12)
where the hyperparameters of the model are denoted as
h = {α, γ, β0, m0, κ0, V0, ν0}. The algorithm of the learning
of spatial concepts is shown in Algorithm 1.
The conditional posterior distribution of each element used
for performing Gibbs sampling can be expressed as follows:
An index it of the position distribution is sampled for each
data t ∈To from a posterior distribution as follows:
it ∼p(it = k | xt, µ, Σ, φl, Ct)
∝N(xt | µk=it, Σk=it)Mult(it = k | φl=Ct).
(13)
An index Ct of the spatial concepts is sampled for each data
item t ∈To from a posterior distribution as follows:
Ct ∼p(Ct = l | xt, it, Ot,B, µ, Σ, φl, π)
∝Mult(Ot,B | Wl=Ct)Mult(it = k | φl=Ct)
Mult(Ct = l | π)
(14)
where Ot,B denotes a vector of the occurrence counts of words
in the sentence at time t. A posterior distribution representing
word probabilities of the name of place W is calculated as
follows:
p(W | CTo, OTo,B)
∝
Y
l∈L
 Y
l=Ct
t∈To
p(Ot,B | Wl=Ct)

p(Wl)
(15)
where variables with the subscript To denote the set of all
teaching times. A word probability of the name of place Wl
is sampled for each l ∈L as follows:
Wl ∼Mult(Ol | Wl)Dir(Wl | β0) ∝Dir(Wl | βnl)
(16)
where βnl represents the posterior parameter and Ol denotes
the BoW representation of all sentences of Ct = l in t ∈To.
A posterior distribution representing the position distribution
µ, Σ is calculated as follows:
p(µ, Σ | iTo, xTo, CTo, φl)
∝
Y
k∈K
 Y
k=it

p(xt | µk=it, Σk=it)

A position distribution µk, Σk is sampled for each k ∈K as
follows:
µk, Σk ∼N(xk | µk, Σk)NIW(µk, Σk | m0, κ0, V0, ν0)
∝NIW(µk, Σk | mnk, κnk, Vnk, νnk)
(18)
where NIW(·) denotes the Gaussian–inverse–Wishart distri-
bution; mnk, κnk, Vnk, and νnk represent the posterior param-
eters; and xk indicates the set of the teaching positions of
it = k in t ∈To. A topic probability distribution π of spatial
concepts is sampled as follows:
π ∼Mult(CTo | π)Dir(π | γ) ∝Dir(π | CTo, γ).
(19)
A posterior distribution representing the mixed weights φl of
the position distributions is calculated as follows:
p(φl | xTo, iTo, CTo, µ, Σ)
∝

l∈L
 Y
l=Ct

(20)
A mixed weight φl of the position distributions is sampled for
each l ∈L as follows:
φl ∼Mult(il | φl)Dir(φl | α) ∝Dir(φl | il, α)
(21)
where il denotes a vector counting all the indices of the
Gaussian distribution of Ct = l in t ∈To.
Self-positions x0:T are sampled by using a Monte Carlo
ﬁxed-lag smoother [30] in the learning phase. The smoother
can estimate self-position x0:t and not p(x0:t | u1:t, z1:t), i.e., a
sequential estimation from the given data u1:t, z1:t until time t,
but it can estimate p(x0:t | u1:T , z1:T ), i.e., an estimation from
the given data u1:T , z1:T until time T later than t (t < T). In
general, the smoothing method can provide a more accurate
estimation than the MCL of online estimation. In contrast, if
the self-position of a robot xt is sampled like direct assignment
sampling for each time t, the sampling of xt is divided in the
case with the teaching time t ∈To and another time t /∈To
as follows:

When the robot hears the name of a place spoken by the
utterer, in addition to the likelihood of the sensor model of
MCL, the likelihood of xt with respect to a speech recognition

xt−1 to its current state xt by using control data. The function
sensor model calculates the likelihood of each particle x[m]

using sensor data zt. These functions are normally used in
MCL. For further details, please refer to [27]. In this case, a
speech recognition sentence Ot,B is obtained by the speech
recognition system using a word dictionary containing all the
learned words.
IV. EXPERIMENT I
In this experiment, we validate the evidence of the proposed
method (SpCoA) in an environment simulated on the simulator
platform SIGVerse2 [31], which enables the simulation of
social interactions. The speech recognition is performed using
the Japanese continuous speech recognition system Julius3
[32], [33]. The set of 43 Japanese phonemes deﬁned by
Acoustical Society of Japan (ASJ)’s speech database com-
mittee is adopted by Julius [32]. The representation of these
phonemes is also adopted in this study. The Julius system
uses a word dictionary containing 115 Japanese syllables. The
microphone attached on the robot is SHURE’s PG27-USB.
Further, an unsupervised morphological analyzer, a latticelm
0.4, is implemented [23].
In the experiment, we compare the following three types
of word segmentation methods. A set of syllable sequences is
given to the graphical model of SpCoA by each method. This
set is used for the learning of spatial concepts as recognized
uttered sentences OTo,B.
(A) latticelm (proposed method)
Syllable recognition results in the lattice format are
segmented by using latticelm.
(B) 1-best NPYLM
Syllable recognition results of the 1-best method are
segmented by using latticelm. In this case, latticelm
[23] is almost equivalent to NPYLM [14].

(C) Bag-of-syllables (BoS)
Syllable recognition results of the 1-best method are
segmented by each syllable. In other words, this
method is used for segmenting not words but ele-
ments of the recognized syllable sequences directly
in the BoS (bag-of-letters) representation.
The remainder of this section is organized as follows: In
Section IV-A, the conditions and results of learning spatial
concepts are described. The experiments performed using the
learned spatial concepts are described in Section IV-B to IV-E.
In Section IV-B, we evaluate the accuracy of the phoneme
recognition and word segmentation for uttered sentences. In
Section IV-C, we evaluate the clustering accuracy of the
estimation results of index Ct of spatial concepts for each
teaching utterance. In Section IV-D, we evaluate the accuracy
of the acquisition of names of places. In Section IV-E, we
show that spatial concepts can be utilized for effective self-
localization.
A. Learning of spatial concepts
1) Conditions: We conduct this experiment of spatial con-
cept acquisition in the environment prepared on SIGVerse. The
experimental environment is shown in Fig. 3. A mobile robot
can move by performing forward, backward, right rotation,
or left rotation movements on a two-dimensional plane. In
this experiment, the robot can use an approximately correct
map of the considered environment. The robot has a range

sensor in front and performs self-localization on the basis of
an occupancy grid map. The initial particles are deﬁned by
the true initial position of the robot. The number of particles
is M = 1000.
The lag value of the Monte Carlo ﬁxed-lag smoothing is
ﬁxed at 100. The other parameters of this experiment are as
follows: L = 50, K = 50, α = 1.5, γ = 8, β0 = 0.5,
m0 = [0, 0]T, κ0 = 0.001, V0 = diag(1000, 1000), and
ν0 = 2. The number of iterations used for Gibbs sampling
is 100. This experiment does not include the direct assign-
ment sampling of xt in equation (22), i.e., lines 22–24 of
Algorithm 1 are omitted, because we consider that the self-
position can be obtained with sufﬁciently good accuracy by
using the Monte Carlo smoothing. Eight places are selected
as the learning targets, and eight types of place names are
considered. Each uttered place name is shown in Fig. 3. These
utterances include the same name in different places, i.e.,
“teeburunoatari” (which means near the table in English),
and different names in the same place, i.e., “kiqchiN” and
“daidokoro” (which mean a kitchen in English). The other
teaching names are “geNkaN” (which means an entrance or
a doorway in English); “terebimae” (which means the front
of the TV in English); “gomibako” (which means a trash
box in English); “hoNdana” (which means a bookshelf in
English); and “sofaamae” (which means the front of the sofa
in English). The teaching utterances, including the 10 types
of phrases, are spoken for a total of 90 times. The phrases in
each uttered sentence are listed in Table II.
2) Results: The learning results of spatial concepts obtained
by using the proposed method are presented here. Fig. 4
shows the position distributions learned in the experimental
environment. Fig. 5 (top) shows the word distributions of
the names of places for each spatial concept, and Fig. 5
(bottom) shows the multinomial distributions of the indices of
the position distributions. Consequently, the proposed method
can learn the names of places corresponding to each place of
the learning target. In the spatial concept of index Ct = 1, the
highest probability of words was “sofamae”, and the highest
probability of the indices of the position distribution was
k = 0; therefore, the name of a place “sofamae” was learned
to correspond to the position distribution of k = 0. In the
spatial concept of index Ct = 5, “kiqchi” and “daidokoro”
were learned to correspond to the position distribution of
k = 1. Therefore, this result shows that multiple names
can be learned for the same place. In the spatial concept
of index Ct = 0, “te” and “durunoatari” (one word in a
normal situation) were learned to correspond to the position
distributions of k = 3 and k = 4. Therefore, this result shows
that the same name can be learned for multiple places.
B. Phoneme recognition accuracy of uttered sentences
1) Conditions: We compared the performance of three
types of word segmentation methods for all the considered
uttered sentences. It was difﬁcult to weigh the ambiguous
syllable recognition and the unsupervised word segmentation
separately. Therefore, this experiment considered the positions
of a delimiter as a single letter. We calculated the matching

rate of a phoneme string of a recognition result of each uttered
sentence and the correct phoneme string of the teaching data
that was suitably segmented into Japanese morphemes using
MeCab4, which is an off-the-shelf Japanese morphological
analyzer that is widely used for natural language processing.
The matching rate of the phoneme string was calculated by
using the phoneme accuracy rate (PAR) as follows:
PAR = 1 −S + D + I
N
.
(25)
The numerator of equation (25) is calculated by using the
Levenshtein distance between the correct phoneme string and
the recognition phoneme string. S denotes the number of
substitutions; D, the number of deletions; and I, the number
of insertions. N represents the number of phonemes of the
correct phoneme string.
2) Results: Table III shows the results of PAR. Table IV
presents examples of the word segmentation results of the
three considered methods. We found that the unsupervised
morphological analyzer capable of using lattices improved
the accuracy of phoneme recognition and word segmentation.
Consequently, this result suggests that this word segmentation
method considers the multiple hypothesis of speech recogni-
tion as a whole and reduces uncertainty such as variability
in recognition by using the syllable recognition results in the
lattice format.
C. Estimation accuracy of spatial concepts
1) Conditions: We compared the matching rate with the
estimation results of index Ct of the spatial concepts of each
teaching utterance and the classiﬁcation results of the correct
answer given by humans. The evaluation of this experiment
used the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [34]. ARI is a measure
of the degree of similarity between two clustering results.
Further, we compared the proposed method with a method
of word clustering without location information for the in-
vestigation of the effect of lexical acquisition using location
information. In particular, a method of word clustering with-
out location information used the Dirichlet process mixture
(DPM) of the unigram model of an SBP representation. The
parameters corresponding to those of the proposed method
were the same as the parameters of the proposed method and
were estimated using Gibbs sampling.
2) Results: Fig. 6 shows the results of the average of the
ARI values of 10 trials of learning by Gibbs sampling. Here,
we found that the proposed method showed the best score.
These results and the results reported in Section IV-B suggest
that learning by uttered sentences obtained by better phoneme

recognition and better word segmentation produces a good
result for the acquisition of spatial concepts. Furthermore,
in a comparison of two clustering methods, we found that
SpCoA was considerably better than DPM, a word clustering
method without location information, irrespective of the word
segmentation method used. The experimental results showed
that it is possible to improve the estimation accuracy of spatial
concepts and vocabulary by performing word clustering that
considered location information.
D. Accuracy of acquired phoneme sequences representing the
names of places
1) Conditions: We evaluated whether the names of places
were properly learned for the considered teaching places. This
experiment assumes a request for the best phoneme sequence
Ot,best representing the self-position xt for a robot. The robot
moves close to each teaching place. The probability of a
word Ot,best when the self-position xt of the robot is given,
p(Ot,best | xt), can be obtained by using equation (24). The
word having the best probability was selected. We compared
the PAR with the correct phoneme sequence and a selected
name of the place. Because “kiqchiN” and “daidokoro” were
taught for the same place, the word whose PAR was the higher
score was adopted.
2) Results: Fig. 7 shows the results of PAR for the word
considered the name of a place. SpCoA (latticelm), the pro-
posed method using the results of unsupervised word seg-
mentation on the basis of the speech recognition results in
the lattice format, showed the best PAR score. In the 1-best
and BoS methods, a part syllable sequence of the name of a
place was more minutely segmented as shown in Table IV.
Therefore, the robot could not learn the name of the teaching
place as a coherent phoneme sequence. In contrast, the robot
could learn the names of teaching places more accurately by
using the proposed method.

E. Self-localization that utilizes acquired spatial concepts
1) Conditions: In this experiment, we validate that the
robot can make efﬁcient use of the acquired spatial concepts.
We compare the estimation accuracy of localization for the
proposed method (SpCoA MCL) and the conventional MCL.
When a robot comes to the learning target, the utterer speaks
out the sentence containing the name of the place once again
for the robot. The moving trajectory of the robot and the
uttered positions are the same in all the trials. In particular,
the uttered sentence is “kokowa ** dayo”. When learning
a task, this phrase is not used. The number of particles is
M = 1000, and the initial particles are uniformly distributed
in the considered environment. The robot performs a control
operation for each time step.
The estimation error in the localization is evaluated as
follows: While running localization, we record the estimation
error (equation (26)) on the xy plane of the ﬂoor for each
time step.
et =
p
(¯xt −x∗
t )2 + (¯yt −y∗
t )2
(26)
where x∗

as obtained from the simulator, and ¯xt = PM

¯yt = PM
i=1 w(i)
t y(i)
t
represent the weighted mean values
of localization coordinates. The normalized weight w(i)

is
obtained from the sensor model in MCL as a likelihood.
In the utterance time, this likelihood is multiplied by the
value calculated using equation (24). x(i)
t , y(i)
t
denote the x-
coordinate and the y-coordinate of index i of each particle
at time t. After running the localization, we calculated the
average of et.
Further, we compared the estimation accuracy rate (EAR)
of the global localization. In each trial, we calculated the
proportion of time step in which the estimation error was less
than 50 cm.

2) Results: Fig. 8 shows the results of the estimation error
and the EAR for 10 trials of each method. All trials of SpCoA
MCL (latticelm) and almost all trials of the method using
1-best NPYLM and BoS showed relatively small estimation
errors. Results of the second trial of 1-best NPYLM and the
ﬁfth trial of BoS showed higher estimation errors. In these
trials, many particles converged to other places instead of the
place where the robot was, based on utterance information.
Nevertheless, compared with those of the conventional MCL,
the results obtained using spatial concepts showed an obvious
improvement in the estimation accuracy. Consequently, spatial
concepts acquired by using the proposed method proved to be
very helpful in improving the localization accuracy.
V. EXPERIMENT II
In this experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed method
was tested by using an autonomous mobile robot TurtleBot 25
in a real environment. Fig. 9 shows TurtleBot 2 used in the
experiments. Mapping and self-localization are performed by
the robot operating system (ROS). The speech recognition
system, the microphone, and the unsupervised morphological
analyzer were the same as those described in Section IV.
A. Learning of spatial concepts in the real environment
1) Conditions: We conducted an experiment of the spatial
concept acquisition in a real environment of an entire ﬂoor of a
building. In this experiment, self-localization was performed
using a map generated by SLAM. The initial particles are
deﬁned by the true initial position of the robot. The generated
map in the real environment and the names of teaching places
are shown in Fig. 10. The number of teaching places was

places having the same names.
19, and the number of teaching names was 16. The teaching
utterances were performed for a total of 100 times.
2) Results: Fig. 11 shows the position distributions learned
on the map. Table V shows the ﬁve best elements of the
multinomial distributions of the name of place WCt and
the multinomial distributions of the indices of the position
distribution φCt for each index of spatial concept Ct. Thus,
we found that the proposed method can learn the names of
places corresponding to the considered teaching places in the
real environment. For example, in the spatial concept of index
Ct = 10, “torire” was learned to correspond to a position
distribution of k = 42. Similarly, “kidanokeN” corresponded
to k = 8 in Ct = 29, and “kaigihitsu” was corresponded
to k = 60 in Ct = 32. In the spatial concept of index
Ct = 27, a part of the syllable sequences was minutely
segmented as “sohatsuke”, “N”, and “tani”, “guchi”. In this
case, the robot was taught two types of names. These words
were learned to correspond to the same position distribution
of k = 55. In Ct = 8, “gomibako” showed a high probability,
and it corresponded to three distributions of the position of
k = 0, 36, 59. The position distribution of k = 13 had the
fourth highest probability in the spatial concept Ct = 8.
Therefore, “raqkukeN,” which had the ﬁfth highest probability
in the spatial concept Ct = 8 (and was expected to relate to
the spatial concept Ct = 74), can be estimated as the word
drawn from spatial concept Ct = 8. However, in practice, this
situation did not cause any severe problems because the spatial
concept of the index Ct = 74 had the highest probabilities for
the word “rapukeN” and the position distribution k = 13 than
Ct = 8. In the probabilistic model, the relative probability
and the integrative information are important. When the robot
listened to an utterance related to “raqkukeN,” it could make
use of the spatial concept of index Ct
= 74 for self-
localization with a high probability, and appropriately updated
its estimated self-location. We expected that the spatial concept
of index Ct = 2 was learned as two separate spatial concepts.
However, “watarirooka” and “kaidaNmae” were learned as
the same spatial concept. Therefore, the multinomial distri-
bution φ2 showed a higher probability for the indices of the
position distribution corresponding to the teaching places of
both “watarirooka” and “kaidaNmae”.
The proposed method adopts a nonparametric Bayesian
method in which it is possible to form spatial concepts
that allow many-to-many correspondences between names and

places. In contrast, this can create ambiguity that classiﬁes
originally different spatial concepts into one spatial concept
as a side effect. There is a possibility that the ambiguity of
concepts such as Ct = 2 will have a negative effect on self-
localization, even though the self-localization performance was
(overall) clearly increased by employing the proposed method.
The solution of this problem will be considered in future work.
In terms of the PAR of uttered sentences, the evaluation
value from the evaluation method used in Section IV-B is
0.83; this value is comparable to the result in Section IV-B.
However, in terms of the PAR of the name of the place,
the evaluation value from the evaluation method used in
Section IV-D is 0.35, which is lower than that in Section
IV-D. We consider that the increase in uncertainty in the real
environment and the increase in the number of teaching words
reduced the performance. We expect that this problem could
be improved using further experience related to places, e.g., if
the number of utterances per place is increased, and additional
sensory information is provided.

B. Modiﬁcation of localization by the acquired spatial con-
cepts
1) Conditions: In this experiment, we veriﬁed the modi-
ﬁcation results of self-localization by using spatial concepts
in global self-localization. This experiment used the learning
results of spatial concepts presented in Section V-A. The
experimental procedures are shown below. The initial particles
were uniformly distributed on the entire ﬂoor. The robot
begins to move from a little distance away to the target place.
When the robot reached the target place, the utterer spoke the
sentence containing the name of the place for the robot. Upon
obtaining the speech information, the robot modiﬁes the self-
localization on the basis of the acquired spatial concepts. The
number of particles was the same as that mentioned in Section
V-A.
2) Results: Fig. 12 shows the results of the self-localization
before (the top part of the ﬁgure) and after (the bottom part
of the ﬁgure) the utterance for three places. The particle states
are denoted by red arrows. The moving trajectory of the robot
is indicated by a green dotted arrow. Figs. 12 (a), (b), and
(c) show the results for the names of places “toire”, “souhat-
sukeN”, and “gomibako”. Further, three spatial concepts, i.e.,
those at k = 0, 36, 59, were learned as “gomibako”. In this
experiment, the utterer uttered to the robot when the robot
came close to the place of k = 36. In all the examples shown
in the top part of the ﬁgure, the particles were dispersed in
several places. In contrast, the number of particles near the
true position of the robot showed an almost accurate increase
in all the examples shown in the bottom part of the ﬁgure.
Thus, we can conclude that the proposed method can modify
self-localization by using spatial concepts.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we discussed the spatial concept acquisition,
lexical acquisition related to places, and self-localization us-
ing acquired spatial concepts. We proposed nonparametric
Bayesian spatial concept acquisition method SpCoA that in-
tegrates latticelm [23], a spatial clustering method, and MCL.
We conducted experiments for evaluating the performance
of SpCoA in a simulation and a real environment. SpCoA
showed good results in all the experiments. In experiments of
the learning of spatial concepts, the robot could form spatial
concepts for the places of the learning targets from human
continuous speech signals in both the room of the simulation
environment and the entire ﬂoor of the real environment.
Further, the unsupervised word segmentation method latticelm
could reduce the variability and errors in the recognition of
phonemes in all the utterances. SpCoA achieved more accurate
lexical acquisition by performing word segmentation using
the lattices of the speech recognition results. In the self-
localization experiments, the robot could effectively utilize
the acquired spatial concepts for recognizing self-position and
reducing the estimation errors in self-localization.
As a method that further improves the performance of the
lexical acquisition, a mutual learning method was proposed by
Nakamura et al. on the basis of the integration of the learning
of object concepts with a language model [35], [36]. Following
a similar approach, Heymann et al. proposed a method that
alternately and repeatedly updates phoneme recognition results
and the language model by using unsupervised word segmenta-
tion [37]. As a result, they achieved robust lexical acquisition.
In our study, we can expect to improve the accuracy of lexical
acquisition for spatial concepts by estimating both the spatial
concepts and the language model.
Furthermore, as a future work, we consider it necessary
for robots to learn spatial concepts online and to recognize
whether the uttered word indicates the current place or desti-
nation. Furthermore, developing a method that simultaneously
acquires spatial concepts and builds a map is one of our
future objectives. We believe that the spatial concepts will
have a positive effect on the mapping. We also intend to
examine a method that associates the image and the landscape
with spatial concepts and a method that estimates both spatial
concepts and object concepts.
