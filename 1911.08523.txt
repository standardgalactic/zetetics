Abstract.
Well–deﬁned nonlinear deformations of free quantum ﬁelds are introduced as manifestly Poincar´e
invariant scaling and resonance properties of non–dynamical scale models in Minkowski space, instead of introducing
nonlinear dynamical deformations of free quantum ﬁelds that require the various truncations and scaling corrections
of regularization and renormalization. With the given algebraic construction, energy and momentum operators
can be constructed ex post facto as the generators of translations. A weakened version of microcausality emerges
naturally, “convex hull microcausality” —that operators associated with two regions of space–time must commute
if the convex hulls of those regions are space–like separated—, which is enough for us to be able to construct an
abundant class of interacting quantum ﬁelds.

1. Introduction
Scaling properties of a quantum ﬁeld theory have become of paramount interest, in the form of the renormalization
group[1, 2, 3], but in current methods they are applied essentially as an afterthought, after an ill–deﬁned dynamics
has ﬁrst been decided upon. Here, we will not approach dynamics until after we have considered how diﬀerent
scales are correlated with each other across space and time, which will be enough for us to construct a unitary
evolution after that has been done. In not stating a Hamiltonian, but instead deriving the evolution after the fact,
we will take these words of Wilson and Kogut[1, p. 79] with maximum seriousness: “the behavior of the system
is determined primarily by the fact that there is cooperative behavior, plus the nature of the degrees of freedom
themselves. The interaction Hamiltonian plays only a secondary role.” We will implement “cooperative behavior”
as diﬀerent types of explicitly constructed well–deﬁned stochastic resonances between diﬀerent wave–numbers: not
having a Hamiltonian will mean that we will not have to regularize or renormalize it.
Instead of working with a free quantum ﬁeld operator–valued distribution ˆφ(x), we will work in the
ﬁrst instance with a quantum ﬁeld operator formalism, which for the free ﬁeld case can be constructed as
ˆφf =
R ˆφ(x)f(x)d4x, using a modulation function f(x), so–called here because it describes how states and
measurement results are modulated when ˆφf and other operators are successively used to modulate a vacuum
vector, |V⟩7→ˆφf1|V⟩, |V⟩7→ˆφf1 ˆφf2|V⟩, and so on, where we take the vacuum vector to be a noisy version of a
carrier signal for the modulations f1, f2, ... . We will emphasize how using diﬀerent modulation functions changes
measurement results in response, where a precise model of a measurement is speciﬁed by giving some combination
of modulation functions, together with how they are to be used as sums and products of operators ˆφf1, ˆφf2, ... .
Although the traditional construction ˆφf for the free quantum ﬁeld is linear, we will here not introduce
nonlinearity by working with powers of the operator–valued distribution ˆφ(x), we will instead introduce
nonlinearity by working with operators ˆξf in a way that does not assume that ˆξf is a linear functional of f,
so that in general ˆξλf+µg ̸= λˆξf + µˆξg. To keep the discussion relatively simple, we will work here mostly with
scalar quantum ﬁelds, so that modulation functions will be scalar functions, taken from a suitable function space,
which we will take to be the Schwartz space of smooth functions for which the fourier transform exists and is also
smooth, following the example of Haag[4, §II.1.2].
We will take it that if we can construct a useful class of interacting quantum ﬁeld operators ˆζf, for any
modulation f, using only scaling and resonance properties, which we will in §6, then we can deﬁne a unitary
translation operator ˆU(a) by its action ˆU(a)ˆζf ˆU(a)† = ˆζfa, where fa(x) = f(x + a), and its trivial action on the
translation invariant vacuum vector ˆU(a)|V⟩= |V⟩, from which we can derive a Hamiltonan dynamics, if we so
wish. The manifestly Poincar´e invariant algebra implicitly contains all dynamical information.
Section 2 discusses in what ways nonlinearity of the quantum ﬁeld is natural, particularly by reference to
renormalization. Section 3 introduces the free Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld and an elementary discussion of the
traditional way in which the dynamics is deformed, with a marginally subversive discussion of that deformation
given in Appendix A, which shows that we can think of that traditional approach as constructing an “operator–
cloud” that is associated with the backward light–cone of the support of a modulation function.
Section 4
introduces a class of nonlinear deformations that satisfy traditional microcausality, then Section 5 introduces
a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent class of nonlinear deformations that do not satisfy microcausality, but do satisfy “convex
hull microcausality”. Section 6 uses those new deformations to construct an operator–cloud that is associated with
the regions of space–time that are obtained by repeated convolution of a modulation function with itself, but that
nonetheless satisﬁes convex hull microcausality. Section 7 shows that we can think of nonlinear quantum ﬁelds
as a way to generate multilinear quantum ﬁelds, using polarization, with the reverse reconstruction of nonlinear
quantum ﬁelds from those multilinear quantum ﬁelds being possible in elementary cases. The construction by
polarization of multilinear quantum ﬁelds is also notable for supporting an alternative motivation for nonlinearity,
through consideration of Haag’s theorem[5, 6].
It should be emphasized that this construction is just a ﬁrst possibility for nonlinear constructions in a dual
formalism that emphasizes modulation functions instead of working in a relatively ill–deﬁned way with operator–
valued distributions. Working with scaling and resonance properties is very much in line with the understanding
of renormalization that has been developed over many years, however other symmetries and other geometrical
properties are likely to be more important if we consider either quantum ﬁeld theory on a curved background or
quantum gravity, and there may be other physically useful constructions at larger or smaller scales.

2. Nonlinearity and renormalization
In a classical context, we would not, except as a ﬁrst approximation, expect a multiplicative modulation of a
Gibbsian thermal vector state |G⟩, acting as a carrier for modulations, to obtain ˆξf|G⟩, say, to result in a precisely
linear response when we compare it to a diﬀerent modulation, ˆξg|G⟩: ⟨G| ˆξ†
g ˆξf |G⟩might or might not be an exactly
linear functional of both f and g. Crucially, there are two linearities in quantum ﬁeld theory: (1) the linearity of
the vacuum and other states as maps from the ∗–algebra of operators that are used as models for measurements
to expectation values, which for the vacuum state is ˆA 7→⟨V| ˆA |V⟩, which is required for there to be a probability
interpretation of the theory and will therefore be carefully preserved; and (2) the linearity of the map of modulation
functions into the ∗–algebra of operators, f 7→ˆξf, for which there is no immediate necessity except convenience
and tractability, so that it will be relinquished here. We can also note, tangentially but somewhat in support, that
axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory often introduces a unitary operator ˆWf = ei ˆφf as a starting point[7], which for
the free ﬁeld case satisﬁes the algebra relation ˆWf ˆWg = ˆWf+ge−[(f ∗,g)−(g∗,f)]/2 and which is clearly not a linear
functional of f.
Renormalization gives
some
motivation
for
introducing
nonlinearity.
In
Hollowood’s account
of
renormalization group ﬂow[3, §1.2], for every physical measurement F in a given experiment, depending on a
length scale ℓ, we want a theoretical model to be invariant under changes of the cutoﬀscale µ →µ′,
F(gi(µ); ℓ)µ = F(gi(µ′); ℓ)µ′,
µ, µ′ > ℓ−1,
(1)
where the gi(µ) are the cutoﬀdependent couplings. In a less idealized theoretical model, ℓwould be replaced
by much more geometrical detail, which is what each modulation function is intended to provide, as a list of
amplitudes ˜f(k) at each wave–number, so, replacing ℓby a possibly very long list of modulation functions, we
obtain
F(gi(µ); f1, ..., fn)µ = F(gi(µ′); f1, ..., fn)µ′,
µ, µ′ > AnInverseLengthDerivedFrom(f1, ..., fn), (2)
where AnInverseLengthDerivedFrom(f1, ..., fn) in general will be mathematically rather arbitrary if we ever allow
the modulation functions to be localized, because in that case the support of the fourier transforms of modulation
functions would be unbounded. In this construction µ and µ′ are only weakly constrained by f1, ..., fn, however
a more systematic approach, preferable just for being more systematic, would be to give the choice of µ, µ′ as
diﬀerent functionals of the modulation functions, µ(f1, ..., fn) and µ′(f1, ..., fn), giving
F(gi(µ(f1, ..., fn)); f1, ..., fn)µ(f1,...,fn) = F(gi(µ′(f1, ..., fn)); f1, ..., fn)µ′(f1,...,fn),
(3)
in which case the dependence of the couplings and of F on f1, ..., fn through µ and µ′ (which are in any case too
simplistic as single variables insofar as they are placeholders for all the many choices made for a given systematic
regularization scheme and renormalization scheme) can be rewritten as
F(gi(f1, ..., fn); f1, ..., fn) = F ′(g′
i(f1, ..., fn); f1, ..., fn).
(4)
There is no expectation that F(gi(µ); ℓ)µ is a linear function of ℓor of the gi, so there is no expectation that
F(gi(f1, ..., fn); f1, ..., fn) = F(˚gi; f1, ..., fn),
(5)
with the ˚gi being constant coupling constants, must be a linear functional of f1, ..., fn, which at least leaves open
the question of whether a quantum ﬁeld operator ˆξf must be a linear functional of f. If it is useful to take ˆξf to
be a nonlinear functional of f, we might prefer to do so.
3. The free Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld and its traditional deformations
The aim of interacting quantum ﬁeld theory has been to deform an operator–valued distribution such as the free
Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld, which satisﬁes
∂µ∂µ ˆφ(x) + m2 ˆφ(x) = 0,
(6)
so that for the derivative V ′(·) of a potential function V (·) an interacting quantum ﬁeld ˆξ(x) satisﬁes
∂µ∂µ ˆξ(x) + m2 ˆξ(x) + :V ′(ˆξ(x)): = 0,
(7)
where the normal–ordering : · · · : is an inadequate ﬁrst step to make this latter equation well-deﬁned. If we work
very formally and unrigorously, we can give, as a solution of this equation [8, §6-1-1],
ˆξ(x) = T†h
e−i ˆ
L(x)i
ˆφ(x)T
h
e−i ˆ
L(x)i
,
(8)

where ˆL(x) =
R
y0<x0:V (ˆφ(y)): d4y and the time–ordering T[· · ·] emphasize a dynamical approach to quantum ﬁeld
theory in contrast to a more structural approach that emphasizes scaling and resonance properties in Minkowski
space. Appendix A shows, with a historically inevitable lack of rigor, that this can be thought of as equivalent to
constructing an operator–cloud that is associated with the backward light–cone.
The free Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld can alternatively be presented in a dual formalism as satisfying
ˆφ∂µ∂µf+m2f = 0, for any modulation function f,
(9)
because ∂µ∂µ is a self–adjoint operator.
The map f 7→∂µ∂µf + m2f maps the modulation function f to a
function that has no component on the forward and backward mass–shells, however the vacuum state precisely
acts to project to the forward mass–shell components. For momentum space raising and lowering operator–valued
distributions a†(k) and a(k) for the free Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld, we have the standard Poincar´e invariant
commutator, in operator–valued distribution form[8, Eq. 3-56],
[a(k), a†(k′)] = ℏ(2π)4δ(k −k′)2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0),
(10)
which becomes, for the lowering operator af =
R
a(k) ˜f ∗(k) d4k
(2π)4 and a conjugate raising operator a†
g, in operator
form,
[af, a†
g] = (f, g) = ℏ
Z
˜f ∗(k)˜g(k)2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4 ,
(11)
where (f, g) is a pre–inner product on the modulation function space that is non–trivial only for modulation
functions that have a component on the forward mass–shell. Consequently, we have (g, ∂µ∂µf + m2f) = 0, trivial
for all modulation functions f and g, because ∂µ∂µf + m2f becomes −(k·k −m2) ˜f(k) as a fourier transform.
The raising and lowering operators allow us to construct a quantum ﬁeld operator ˆφf = af ∗+ a†
f, which solves
Eq. (9) for any modulation function f, because in the vacuum state of the free Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld
⟨V|· · · ˆφf · · · |V⟩results in terms that all include a factor (f ∗, ·) or (·, f). The pre–inner product (f, g) satisﬁes
microcausality because [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (f ∗, g) −(g∗, f) is zero if the modulation functions have supports that are
space–like separated. For a modulation function f(x), ˜f(k) =
R
f(x)eik·xd4x, and similarly for g(y),
(f ∗, g) −(g∗, f) = ℏ
Z
f(x)g(y)
h
eik·(y−x) −e−ik·(y−x)i
2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4 dxdy,
(12)
for which the integral with respect to k is zero, by symmetry, provided the vector y −x is space–like, which is
satisﬁed if the modulation functions f and g have supports that are space–like separated.
4. Deformations I
Once we engage with a modulation function formalism, natural ideas of what a deformation might look like are
rather diﬀerent from Eq. (7), such as
ˆξ∂µ∂µf+m2f+V ′(f) = 0, for any modulation function f,
(13)
or
ˆξ∂µ∂µf+m2f + V ′(ˆξf) = 0, for any modulation function f.
(14)
Unlike deformations that are constructed using polynomials of operator–valued distributions, these and similar
but more complicated equations are well-deﬁned, although there is no guarantee that a particular such choice will
have solutions, nor that any solutions will be useful physical models.
A well–known construction, called a generalized free ﬁeld[9, §3.4], uses raising and lowering operators that
are non–trivial if f has a component on either of several forward mass–shells, with commutator
[af, a†
g] = (f, g)1 + (f, g)2 + . . . .
(15)
Crucially, for any collection of modulation functions f1, ..., fn, the Gram matrices (fi, fj)1, (fi, fj)2, ..., for each
diﬀerent mass mk, and their sum [afi, a†
fj] = P
k(fi, fj)k are all positive semi–deﬁnite matrices, which is enough
to allow the construction of a Hilbert space for an arbitrary number of modulation functions, and hence for the
construction of Fock space as an inductive limit, taking the induction to be over a Schwartz space of modulation
functions on Minkowski space. Note that for physics models in a manifestly Poincar´e invariant formalism it is
enough to introduce a ﬁnite number of modulation functions to model whatever ﬁnite experimental raw data we

may have or anticipate being available, but for mathematical analysis it will be necessary for some purposes to
take the inductive limit over the whole Schwartz space. With the raising and lowering operators constructed in
this way, the quantum ﬁeld operator ˆξf = af ∗+ a†
f is still a linear functional, ˆξλf+µg = λˆξf + µˆξg, which satisﬁes
the higher–order equation
ˆξ(∂µ∂µ+m2
1)(∂µ∂µ+m2
2)···f = 0, for any modulation function f.
(16)
With the dropping of linearity as a requirement, we can also introduce raising and lowering operators that
are non–trivial if f has a component on all of several forward mass–shells, with commutator
[af, a†
g] = (f, g)1(f, g)2 · · · .
(17)
The Hadamard product [afi, a†
fj] = (fi, fj)1(fi, fj)2 · · · is, as required, a positive semi–deﬁnite matrix‡, which is
again enough to allow the construction of a Hilbert space. ˆξf = af ∗+ a†
f satisﬁes multiple diﬀerential equations,
ˆξ∂µ∂µf+m2
1f = 0
and
ˆξ∂µ∂µf+m2
2f = 0
and
· · · , for any modulation function f,
(18)
and microcausality is satisﬁed because (f ∗, g)k = (g∗, f)k for every k, but ˆξf is not a linear functional,
ˆξλf+µg ̸= λˆξf + µˆξg. The spectrum of 4–momentum measurements is conﬁned to the forward light–cone because
(f, g)k projects to the forward light–cone for every k. The two approaches can be combined to give an arbitrary
sum of products of this kind, so that in general the commutator can be a sum of products for many diﬀerent
masses, [af, a†
g] = P

Q
ℓ(f, g)kℓ.
5. Convex Hull Microcausality
Convex hull microcausality is a less constrained microcausality, which requires only that the modulation functions
have the convex hulls of their supports space–like separated.
Historically, this is somewhat presaged by the
eﬀective ﬁeld physics of quasi–particles and collective excitations, which work with the center of mass or otherwise
positively weighted centers of many interacting components, for which such centers may fall outside the supports
of any of the components but will be within the convex hull of the union of those supports.
As a simplest example, convex hull microcausality is satisﬁed by a quantum ﬁeld for which
[ˆξ⋆2
f , ˆξ⋆2
g ] = ([f⋆f]∗, [g⋆g]) −([g⋆g]∗, [f⋆f]),
(19)
using convolution, for which ]
[f⋆f](k) = ˜f 2(k),

(2π)4 f(x1)f(x2)g(y1)g(y2)dx1dx2dy1dy2,
(20)
because (x1 + x2)/2 and (y1 + y2)/2 are always within the convex hull of the supports of f and g respectively, so
(y1 + y2) −(x1 + x2) is space–like and convex hull microcausality is satisﬁed if the convex hulls of the supports of
f and g are space-like separated. Convex hull microcausality is easily seen also to be satisﬁed if we use f ⋆n, for
which ]
[f ⋆n](k) = ˜f n(k), instead of the simplest form, f ⋆2 = f⋆f, in the above.
This is a little surprising, because the support of f ⋆n will overlap the support of g⋆n for large enough n, but
symmetry ensures that (f ⋆n∗, g⋆n) −(g⋆n∗, f ⋆n) nonetheless is zero if the convex hulls of the supports of f and g
are space-like separated (just as symmetry ensures that microcausality is satisﬁed for interacting quantum ﬁelds
despite the backward light cone operator–clouds overlapping). It is possible that other constructions might have a
diﬀerent space–time symmetry that satisfy convex hull or other modiﬁcations of microcausality, but we will here
pursue only constructions of this general form. With this property deﬁned, we can introduce raising and lowering
operators such as
[a⋆n
f , a⋆n
g
†] = δm,n(f ⋆n, g⋆n),
(21)
for which the ﬁelds ˆξ⋆n
f = a⋆n
f ∗+ a⋆n

† independently satisfy convex hull microcausality for diﬀerent n.

symmetry if the convex hulls of the supports of f and g are space–like separated.
Finally, for a scaling vector α1, ..., αn we can introduce a local nonlinear functional F[f](x1, ..., xn), where

which still satisﬁes convex hull microcausality. As well as polynomials, the local nonlinear functional F[f] may
include scalar nonlinear derivations such as ∂f(x)
∂xµ
∂f(x)
∂xµ .
These ﬁelds will give us a well–deﬁned way to construct convex hull microcausal deformations as an operator–
cloud that is associated with all space–time, instead of introducing time–ordering and ill–deﬁned Lagrangian
interaction terms.
6. Deformations II
In Sections 4 and 5, the constructions use only raising and lowering operators, so although the induced evolutions
of measurement results will exhibit considerably diﬀerent geometries, the vacuum state and coherent states —
eigenstates of the lowering operators— are straightforwardly Gaussian, just as for the free ﬁeld. For the traditional
deformation, Eq. (7), in contrast, the vacuum state is not Gaussian because it constructs an operator–cloud in
the backward light–cone as its lowest–level measurement operation. Given Sections 4 and 5, an obvious way to
leverage convex hull microcausality is to construct an operator–cloud in the regions of space–time that result from
convolutions such as ˆξ(α)
f
for various α, where ˆξf = ˆξ(1)
f . For a Hermitian operator ˆSf that uses such convolutions,
we can, for example, construct a quantum ﬁeld
ˆζf = e+i ˆ
Sf ˆξfe−i ˆ
Sf .
(27)
We will introduce several ways to construct ˆSf, of increasing complexity, by example:

, where |αn| ̸= |α′
n| so that ˆS†
f = ˆSf, which constructs an operator–cloud
associated with the space–time region associated with the highest convolution power αn or α′
n. Note that
if for all n, |αn| ̸= 1 and |α′
n| ̸= 1, then this construction will be trivial because in that case every term
would commute with ˆξf; similarly, each added term must not commute with at least one other previously
added term. Each successive level of approximation introduces resonances associated with diﬀerent scales,
either smaller or larger. The sum over n for the chosen values of αn and α′
n and for an appropriate choice of
modulation function f is comparable to the integration over all points in the backward light–cone.
With this construction, however, we only introduce resonances at wave–numbers that are multiples of wave–
numbers for which ˜f(k) ̸= 0, which the next construction goes beyond.

If we use the simplest local nonlinear functional,
Fn[f](x1, ... ) = Q
j[f(xj)]2, for example, for which the fourier transform of each factor is f
f 2(kj) =
R ˜f(uj) ˜f(kj −uj) d4kj
(2π)4 , then we can obtain nontrivial resonances even when there are no wave–numbers
for which ˜f(k) and ˜g(k) are both nonzero when we consider transition amplitudes such as, as the most
elementary case, |⟨V| ˆζ†
g ˆζf |V⟩|2, giving a nontrivial theory because the interactions cannot be diagonalized in
momentum space (see, for example, [1, p.85]).
• We can use an arbitrary product of an arbitrary number of diﬀerent ˆξ
(Fn,αn)
f
for each term in the sum.
There is no need for ˆSf to be positive semi–deﬁnite because the conﬁnement of the spectrum of 4–momentum
measurements to the forward light–cone is independently ensured by the projection to the forward light–cone
that is required of all of the pre–inner products (f, g)i that are used.
• We can replace the PN
n=1 by an integration over a range of values ν, provided there is only a countable number
of diﬀerent values for |αν|, |α′
ν|, et cetera: without this constraint, we would again ﬁnd ourselves multiplying
distributions.
It should not be thought surprising that there are at least this many options, because the mathematics of quantum
ﬁeld theory ﬁxes a system of probability densities over a ﬁeld of observables, which is a signiﬁcantly higher–order
mathematical structure than a classical ﬁeld, and the regularization schemes and renormalization schemes of
traditional interacting quantum ﬁelds also conceal much complexity. With this enormous ﬂexibility, it will be hard
to prove that no possible choice of such structures and of modulation functions can model a given collection of
experiments, although we may ﬁnd that such models are too intractably complex for them to be useful.
The symmetries of the expression for quantum ﬁeld operators ˆζf will result in the ∗–algebra Aζ that is
generated by them being the same as or a sub–∗–algebra of the ∗–algebra Aξ that is generated by all the quantum
ﬁeld operators ˆξ(α)
f
that are used in the construction of the ˆζf. If Aζ = Aξ, then it becomes a delicate question
whether one or the other is more important, however for most interesting cases we would expect Aζ ⊂Aξ, as a
nontrivial consequence of the symmetries of speciﬁc stochastic resonance conditions.
7. Polarization and Multilinearity
There is another way to motivate the above discussion, which was introduced in [10] and which some may ﬁnd
more compelling. Given a nonlinear quantum ﬁeld ˆζf, one possibility is to think of it as a generating function
from which we can construct a system of symmetric multilinear quantum ﬁelds, each of which is linear in each of
n modulation functions f1, ..., fn, by polarization,

from which we can construct a representation of a quantum ﬁeld ˆζ(x1, ..., xn) that is a symmetric multi–point
operator–valued distribution.
Reconstruction of ˆζf if we are given ˆζ(n)(x1, ..., xn) for all n will be possible if
ˆζ(n)(x1, ..., xn) ̸= 0 only for a ﬁnite number of such n, but will in general not be possible. Whether ˆζf can be

reconstructed or not, we can use ˆζ(n)
f1,...,fn and ˆζ(n)(x1, ..., xn) to construct models. [10] suggests that a possible
reaction to Haag’s theorem[5, 6] is to think that the Fock–Hilbert space generated by free 1–particle Wightman
ﬁelds[4, Ch. II] is not “big enough” to model bound states or interacting states generally, which can be taken
to suggest adding multi–particle bound and interacting states explicitly as multi–point ﬁelds ˆφ(x1, ..., xn) and
constructing physical states as superpositions of diﬀerent products of 1–particle and multi–particle ﬁelds acting
on the vacuum state. We are already accustomed to introducing quasiparticles and collective excitations that
are eﬀectively bound multi–particle ﬁelds, such as phonons in statistical physics and such as for protons in high
energy physics, and to using a simple center–of–mass wave function as a ﬁrst approximation for the interference
patterns that can be generated using large molecules. From the point of view of this paper, in contrast to [10], that
approach is less well–motivated than working with the nonlinear quantum ﬁeld ˆζf, then perhaps thinking of it as a
generating function for operator–valued distributions ˆζ(n)(x1, ..., xn), however some aspects of the construction are
diﬀerent depending on the starting point one adopts: in particular, one can construct multi–point ﬁelds that are
not symmetric in their arguments. In either case, however, the already disconcerting nonlocality of free quantum
ﬁelds is only made greater by the introduction of nonlinearity and of convolution, though within the constraint of
convex hull microcausality.
8. Discussion
As mentioned in the introduction, it should be emphasized that this construction is just a ﬁrst possibility for
nonlinear constructions in a dual formalism that emphasizes the modulation functions instead of working in an
ill–deﬁned way with operator–valued distributions.
The constructions of Sections 5 and 6 are integral forms that have not been and do not seem to be easily
speciﬁed as solutions of diﬀerential equations. In practice, however, eﬀective quantum ﬁelds already only take
a diﬀerential equation as a starting point, with higher–order and higher–degree terms introduced as necessary
without much regard to what diﬀerential equation the resulting construction might satisfy.
The focus on nonlinearity and on scaling and resonance properties are both natural from a classical perspective,
however each introduces a new form of nonlocality. Nonlinearity, by polarization, introduces a linear multipoint
structure that can be arbitrarily nonlocal, but still may satisfy microcausality in the sense that [ˆζf, ˆζg] = 0 whenever
the supports of f and g are space–like separated. Resonance through the convolution pathway of Section 5 is also
nonlinear, so it also introduces a linear multipoint structure, however it only satisﬁes convex hull microcausality,
that [ˆζf, ˆζg] = 0 whenever the convex hulls of the supports of f and g are space–like separated. These introductions,
however, can and should be seen as not signiﬁcantly more global than the restriction to positive frequency that is
introduced by free quantum ﬁelds: the diﬀerential equation ∂µ∂µ ˆφ(x) + m2 ˆφ(x) = 0 is purely local, but the use of
the solution 2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) in Eq. (10) requires an essentially nonlocal choice of boundary conditions.
Nonlinearity may in some cases require us to be very careful when accurately modeling complex experiments.
The exact form of a low–frequency envelope applied to an otherwise high–frequency modulation may matter for
some kinds of resonances, for example, even when the low and high frequency components are separated by many
orders; similarly, the immediate harmonics of a modulation may make a very signiﬁcant diﬀerence, so that a
triangle waveform modulation may behave very diﬀerently from a sinusoidal modulation. This sensitivity to both
low– and high–frequency components is rather contrary to the principles of the renormalization group, which
looks for invariance of observables under scale transformations at large and small scales, however it is desirable
to measure and to model dependencies on all features of any given modulation. The choice of a detailed input
modulation to achieve a desired response is already a signiﬁcant task in classical nonlinear signal processing, which
is made more diﬃcult by the eﬀects of quantum and other noise and the need to engineer probability measures
for samples of a noisy signal, not just amplitudes of a signal, all of which requires even greater ingenuity.
A resonance in classical mechanics is a preferred frequency, so that if a system is externally driven by a
signal that has components at that frequency, the system will respond with steadily increasing amplitude, until
nonlinearity and other eﬀects limit that increase.
For quantum ﬁelds, an applied modulation will cause, at
other times and places, a response (which we can take to be a probability density for a sample space of possible
measurement results) that depends on whether the measurement operator is tuned to that applied modulation.
The mathematics above says that the applied modulation doesn’t only drive its own wavenumbers, it also drives
overtones, undertones, and more general auxiliary wavenumbers in ways that are quite analogous to the elaborate
relationships between diﬀerent modes of higher–dimensional systems such as a drum. We can loosely think of that
part of the structure of space-time over which we have no control as of the same type as boundary and material

conditions of a drum (taking it that, for the sake of this comparison, we have no control of the boundary and
materials of a drum for the duration of an experiment), insofar as whatever the structure of space–time might be
controls what resonances are more or less important. Without knowing anything about the structure of space–
time, or of the boundary and material of a drum, we can describe the response, for a given measurement, to a
given applied modulation. To carry the analogy a little more, the sound of a drum —the nonlinear response of
our ears and our neural processing to drumsticks brushing or beating on a drumhead, or the look of the Wigner
distribution functions of the voltages from diﬀerently placed microphones— is “shaped” not only by the geometry
of its boundary but also by its density, thickness, stiﬀness, tension, every detail of the crystalline and amorphous
structure of all its parts, and by how it is mounted. In abstract terms, all such boundary and material details
contribute to the conditioning of measurement results and how they can most fruitfully be analyzed, however
the ﬁnite numbers of measurements we make will not absolutely ﬁx every detail of how the drum was made,
and similarly we can expect measurements of the response to however we brush or beat or modulate the vacuum
state not to ﬁx its every detail.
We can, however, as empiricists, choose to deny the analogy with a drum
altogether, so that we insist that there is only the state, which describes measurement results, and that we can
only tendentiously claim that there really is a carrier of the state, which would only in overactive imagination
explain those measurement results.
A quantum ﬁeld theory has historically told us a dynamics, which determines resonances as a model for what
we observe, but if we approach the question less ambitiously, it can be useful and satisfying enough for a quantum
resonance theory to model resonances directly. The formalism introduced here may not be enough to model all
the resonances we observe, but it is hopefully enough to begin a worthwhile new approach to the question.
I am grateful for comments from Stephen Paul King.
Appendix A. Interacting quantum ﬁelds as an operator–cloud
The argument presented here appeared in arxiv.org:1211.2831, which, however, is otherwise deservedly unpublished
(so it is not included in the bibliography). Superﬁcially, the argument does little more than establish that Eq. (8)
is a plausible solution for Eq. (7), if we content ourselves with mathematics that is not well–deﬁned, however it
also establishes the less common idea that Eq. (8) can be understood to describe a structured cloud of operators
associated with the backward light–cone of the free ﬁeld operator–valued distribution that seeds the construction.
The components of ˆL(x) =
R
y0<x0 V (ˆφ(y))d4y (which is used in Eq. (8)) that are space-like separated from
x commute with ˆφ(x), and because of time-ordering those components cancel with the time–reversed components
of the inverse, so that we can substitute

from and earlier than x. Furthermore, the adjoint action of ˆφ(x) on a time-ordered expression is a derivation,
because time-ordering ensures commutativity, so that, taking a quartic scalar interaction with Hamiltonian density

where the restriction to the backward light–cone ▲(x) is equivalent to replacing the propagator i∆(x −z) by
−iGret(x −z), as we see from Eq. (A.3). Insofar as we can take : ˆφ3(z) : formally to be an inﬁnite multiple of
ˆφ(z) subtracted from ˆφ3(z), we can take : ˆξ3(z): formally to be the same inﬁnite multiple of ˆξ(z) subtracted from
ˆξ3(z).
ˆφ(x) satisﬁes the homogeneous Klein–Gordon equation, (∂µ∂µ + m2)ˆφ(x) = 0, and Gret(x −z) satisﬁes
(∂µ∂µ + m2)Gret(x −z) = δ4(x −z), so, applying the operator (∂µ∂µ + m2) to the last line of Eq. (A.4), ˆξ(x)
satisﬁes the nonlinear diﬀerential equation
(∂µ∂µ + m2)ˆξ(x) + λ

(A.5)
The above construction shows that, apart from the mathematically ill–deﬁned necessity to regularize and
renormalize, we can construct an interacting ﬁeld by replacing ˆφ(x) at a point by an operator–cloud at points of the
backward light–cone of x, constructed using the propagator Gret(x −z). This is compatible with the usual, more
practical use of the Feynman propagator and integration over all space–time, but it is worthwhile to recognize that
the same algebraic structure can be presented using the retarded propagator, without introducing time–ordering,
and with integration restricted to the backward light–cone. We can also add an arbitrary solution I(x −z) of the
Klein–Gordon equation to the last line of Eq. (A.4), to obtain

constructing operator–clouds that have the same local structure, satisfying Eq. (A.5), but that are associated with
