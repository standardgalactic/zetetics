Remarkably, van Kampen [13] has argued that the AB effect is in fact instan-
taneous, but that this cannot be directly observed since the instantaneous action
of the magnetic effect is accordingly cancelled by the electric AB effect.  Also

Aharonov–Casher Effect
Daniel Rohrlich
In 1984, 25 years after the prediction of the  Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect,
Aharonov and Casher [1] predicted a “dual” effect. In both effects, a particle is

excluded from a tubular region of space, but otherwise no force acts on it. Yet it
acquires a measurable quantum phase that depends on what is inside the tube of
space from which it is excluded. In the AB effect, the particle is charged and the
tube contains a magnetic ﬂux. In the Aharonov–Casher (AC) effect, the particle is
neutral, but has a magnetic moment, and the tube contains a line of charge. Experi-
ments in neutron [2], vortex [3], atom [4], and electron [5] interferometry bear out
the prediction of Aharonov and Casher. Here we brieﬂy explain the logic of the AC
effect and how it is dual to the AB effect.
We begin with a two-dimensional version of the AB effect. Figure 1 shows an
electron moving in a plane, and also a “ﬂuxon”, i.e. a small region of magnetic
ﬂux (pointing out of the plane) from which the electron is excluded. In Fig. 1 the
ﬂuxon is in a quantum  superposition of two positions, and the electron diffracts
around one of the positions but not the other. Initially, the ﬂuxon and electron are in
a product state |Ψin⟩:
|Ψin⟩= 1
2(|f1⟩+ |f2⟩) ⊗(|e1⟩+ |e2⟩),
where |f1⟩and |f2⟩represent the two ﬂuxon wave packets and |e1⟩and |e2⟩repre-
sent the two electron wave packets. After the electron passes the ﬂuxon, their state
|Ψﬁn⟩is not a product state; the relative phase between |e1⟩and |e2⟩depends on the
ﬂuxon position:
|Ψﬁn⟩= 1
2|f1⟩⊗(|e1⟩+ |e2⟩) + 1
2|f2⟩⊗(|e1⟩+ eiφAB|e2⟩).

ﬂuxon, each in a superposition

electron wave packets enclose
only one of the ﬂuxon wave
packets

Aharonov–Casher Effect

Here φAB is the Aharonov–Bohm phase, and |f2⟩represents the ﬂuxon positioned
between the two electron  wave packets. Now if we always measure the position of
the ﬂuxon and the relative phase of the electron, we discover the Aharonov–Bohm
effect: the electron acquires the relative phase φAB if and only if the ﬂuxon lies
between the two electron paths. But we can rewrite |Ψﬁn⟩as follows:
|Ψﬁn⟩= 1
2(|f1⟩+ |f2⟩) ⊗|e1⟩+ 1
2(|f1⟩+ eiφAB|f2⟩) ⊗|e2⟩.
This rewriting implies that if we always measure the relative phase of the ﬂuxon and
the position of the electron, we discover an effect that is analogous to the Aharonov–
Bohm effect: the ﬂuxon acquires the relative phase φAB if and only if the electron
passes between the two ﬂuxon wave packets. Indeed, the effects are equivalent: we
can choose a reference frame in which the ﬂuxon passes by the stationary electron.
Then we ﬁnd the same relative phase whether the electron paths enclose the ﬂuxon
or the ﬂuxon paths enclose the electron.
In two dimensions, the two effects are equivalent, but there are two inequivalent
ways to go from two to three dimensions while preserving the topology (of paths
of one particle that enclose the other): either the electron remains a particle and the
ﬂuxon becomes a tube of ﬂux, or the ﬂuxon remains a particle (a neutral particle
with a magnetic moment) and the electron becomes a tube of charge. These two
inequivalent ways correspond to the AB and AC effects, respectively. They are not
equivalent but dual, i.e. equivalent up to interchange of electric charge and magnetic
ﬂux.
In the AB effect, the electron does not cross through a magnetic ﬁeld; in the AC
effect, the neutral particle does cross through an electric ﬁeld. However, there is no
force on either particle. The proof [6] is surprisingly subtle and holds only if the line
of charge is straight and parallel to the magnetic moment of the neutral particle [8].
Hence only for such a line of charge are the AB and AC effects dual.
Duality has another derivation. To derive their effect, Aharonov and Casher [1]
ﬁrst obtained the nonrelativistic Lagrangian for a neutral particle of magnetic mo-
ment μ interacting with a particle of charge e. In Gaussian units, it is
L = 1
2mv2 + 1
2MV 2 + e
cA(r −R) · (v −V),
where M, R, V and m, r, v are the mass, position and velocity of the neutral and
charged particle, respectively, and the vector potential A(r −R) is
A(r −R) = μ × (r −R)
|r −R|3
.
Note L is invariant under respective interchange of r, v and R, V. Thus L is the
same whether an electron interacts with a line of magnetic moments (AB effect) or
a magnetic moment interacts with a line of electrons (AC effect). However, if we
begin with the AC effect and replace the magnetic moment with an electron, and all

the electrons with the original magnetic moment, we end up with magnetic moments
that all point in the same direction, i.e. with a straight line of magnetic ﬂux. Hence
the original line of electrons must have been straight. We see intuitively that the
effects are dual only for a straight line of charge.1

Algebraic Quantum Mechanics
N.P. Landsman
Algebraic quantum mechanics is an abstraction and generalization of the  Hilbert
space formulation of quantum mechanics due to von Neumann [5]. In fact, von Neu-
mann himself played a major role in developing the algebraic approach. Firstly, his
joint paper [3] with Jordan and Wigner was one of the ﬁrst attempts to go beyond
Hilbert space (though it is now mainly of historical value). Secondly, he founded
the mathematical theory of operator algebras in a magniﬁcent series of papers [4, 6].
