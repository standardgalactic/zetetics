Chapter V
ALFRED ADLER ON RELIGION
Alfred Adler (1870-1937) was a Jew and spent much of 
his early life in Vienna. Like Freud, he too entered the field 
of psychology through psychiatry. He was very much interested 
in the Freudian doctrines and joined Freud's discussion circle 
in 1902, wherefrom# he started regarding himself as a junior 
colleague rather than a Freudian disciple. A  charter meatoer 
of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, he became its president 
and one of its foremost original thinkers. Encouraged by 
Freud, Adler engaged in those original investigations in 
psychoanalysis, which led to his gradual but unmistakable 
departure from Freudian thought and to his resignation in 1911 
from the society. He founded a new school - 'Individual 
Psychology' and in 1935 this school began to pistolish its own 
organ, "International Journal of Individual Psychology". 
Following world War I# Adler became interested in the 
psychology of children and instituted child guidance clinics 
in Vienna.
Adler calls his school 'Individual* because it 
stresses the uniqueness with which each individual person 
develops his own style of life. The word 'individual' is 
derived from the Latin word 'individuum', which literally

266
Means 'undiVided', 'indivisible'. Individual psychology
emphasizes not only the uniqueness of each individual but
also the organic wholeness of the human personality. As
Adler says* "Individual Psychology tries to see Individual
lines as a whole and regards each single reaction* each
movement and impulse as an articulated part of an individual
6
attitude towards life
From the very outset* Freud's theories appealed to 
Adler, who had for sometime been interested in the capacity 
of the body to condensate for organic change. This was a 
known fact among physicians that damage to certain organs in 
the bedf was sometimes followed by a compensatory reaction* 
which from teleological point of view might be regarded as 
the organ's attempt to overcome its defect. Adler believed 
that it was possible to observe similar reactions to organic 
defects in the psychological sphere. Such ebservatlons made 
it reasonable to suppose that it mis the very inferiority of 
the functions which stimulated the individual to overcome his 
defects* te such good effect that ence inferior function 
became the superior one. So far Adler's thesis* presented in 
his book "A Study of Organic Inferiority and Its Psychical 
Compensation" (1967} was readily acceptable to Freud and his 
followers as a unique contribution to ego psychology* but the

next four years made it apparent that Adler was developing 
his concept, not merely as an interesting sideline, but as a 
key to the understanding ef the whole Mental life. According 
to him, to be a human being means to possess a feeling of 
inferiority that is constantly pressing on towards its own 
conquest.
The science of Individual Psychology develops out of 
the effort to understand that mysterious creative power of 
life - that power Which expresses itself in the desire to
develop* to strive and to achieve - and even to compensate for
2
defects in one direction by striving for success in another. 
This power is teleological ~ it expresses itself in the 
striving after a goal and in this striving bodily movement and 
mental condition cooperate. It is thus absurd to study 
bodily movements and mental conditions abstractly without 
relation to an individual whole. The important thing is to 
understand the context - the goal of an individual*s life, 
which marks the line ef direction for all his acts and 
movements. This goal enables us to understand the hidden 
meaning behind the various separate acts - we see them as parts 
ef a whole. And When we study the parts - provided we study 
them as parts of a whole - we get a better sense of the whole.

Adler d iffe rs from Freud In several respects, most
noticeably at f ir s t  by his emphasis @n ego rather than lifcico,
as the great motivating force in li f e  and source of neurotic 
3
d iffic u lt ie s . 
Both Freud and Adler accept the importance o ‘ 
in fa n tile  period as moulding the character and behaviour of 
human being. 
The “in fan tile sexuality" which is  so much 
stressed by Freud, seems to Adler a strained interpretation 
o f the lit t le  c h ild 's behaviour. 
Much more obvious and 
fundamental in  A d ler's view are the ch ild 's resistance to 
domination and eagerness to dominate. 
The child is actually 
weak and in fe rio r in many ways to those around him and at 
times feels in fe rio r, but he combats this feelin g by assert!no 
him self as fa r as possible and by aspiring to grow up and be 
superior. 
Everyone, Adler says, has a fundamental will for 
power, an urge towards dominance and superiority, 
if an 
individual feels himself in fe rio r in some respect, he is 
driven by h is feeling o f in fe rio rity  toward a goal of 
superiority. 
He strives to make himself superior or at least 
to put up a pretense o f superiority. 
He is  driven towards 
compensation o f one kind o r another.
A ll human action, a ll human progress can be 
explained in terms o f this strivin g to overcome the in fe rio rity . 
Man finds himself exposed without protection to the forces ol

nature and is forced to provide for his safety. 
Naturally mor­
al ways searches for safety and protection. This feeling 
inferiority drives him to make his position higher and better . 
This is the goal of human behaviour towards which he directs 
his striving. As he says* “The impetus from minus to plus 
never ends* The urge from below to above never ceases. 
Whatever premises all our philosophers and psychologists drear* 
of - self-preservation, pleasure principle, equalization - al] 
these are but vague representations, attempts to express the 
great upward drive.* 
Thus for Adler, the striving for 
superiority is innate, an intrinsic necessity of life. 
It is 
the basic dynamic principle. There are no separate drives, 
for each drive receives its power from this basic urge, 
in 
short, Adler regards the “self-assertive impulse" rather thar 
the sex impulse as the major drive, and as the drive most 
likely to generate hostility toward competitors, anti-social
C
attitudes and the maladjustments of neuroses and psychoses.
Adler is very much opposed to psychic determinism. 
He believes in mind’s free play. As he says, "what we 
perceive of mental movement is itself a movement which i- 
directed towards a goal 
.. 
.. we cannot imagine a mental
and emotional life without a goal 
.. 
.. 
No human being
can think, feel, will, dream without all these activities

being determined, continued, modified and directed, toward ar 
ever-present objective," 
For Adler, this very idea that a 
man is constantly striving towards a goal furnishes the way of 
understanding a man's mental life. Thus, we find that Adler'? 
thought moves outwards towards the problems of man's 
adaptation to the external world, while Freud's thought tends 
to ignore the external, to concentrate inwards. Adler 
emphasizes the forward orientation, whereas Freud has laid 
emphasis on backward orientation.
The principal feature of Adler's theory lies in Its 
emphasis on the -teleological character of human striving. 
Individual's life is always marked, in all direction by the 
goal. Whether a person is having the normal way or the 
neurotic way of life, the clue is ever the goal. Man is 
motivated more by his expectations of the future than by his 
experiences of the past. It is a crusade against mechanistic 
psychology on behalf of a teleological psychology. Such a 
view runs counter to prevalent opinion regarding the 
scientific respectability of the concept of teleology. As a 
concept it has theological connotations stemming from medieval 
teaching regarding god's purposes in directing the course of 
mundane events by supernatural intervention. Ansbachers 
observe, "It was in Vaihinger's idealistic positivism that
6. Adler, A.,
Understanding Human Nature, p. 19

205
Adler now found for his subjectivistic and finalistic
psychology foundation which was acceptable, encouraging and 
7
stimulating."
Hans Vaihinger’s book, "The Philosophy of 'As if' '* 
appeared in 1911, the same year in the beginning of which 
Adler withdrew from the Freudian circle. Adler was highly 
influenced by Vaihinger's fictionalism in his concept of goal. 
Hans Vaihinger was one of the most acute and careful of 
Kant's commentators. Kant showed that our ideas of reason 
like soul, world as a whole and god do not represent any 
objective realities which we can possibly know, but, we are 
nevertheless aided in our enquiries in different fields o* 
psychology, cosmology and theology if we proceed as if there
P
were objects like soul, world as a whole and god. 
Kant
Q
called them "neuristie fictions". 
Vaihinger's main insicht 
was suggested by this 'as if* justification of the ideas o* 
reason. Adler takes over this philosophical doctrine o* 
idealistic positivism and bends it to his own design. He 
combines the concept of fiction with that of the goals. The 
goal does not exist in the future as a part Of some 
teleological design, but it exists subjectively here and no**

as a striving for an ideal which affects present behaviour. 
Woodworth therefore says, "By reducing the goal to an idea] 
operating in the present, the objection against teleological 
causality was e l i m i n a t e d . " T h e  fictional goal is thus a 
device of the individual to free himself from inferiority 
feeling. On the basis of this combination of 'fiction' and 
'goal* Adler understands the concept of 'God' in religion as 
a mere idea and not an independent spiritual reality. At the 
same time he opines that such an idea is a necessary goa] of 
human beings, because it is the very idea of superiority and 
perfection to the highest possible degree, which every human 
being is striving to achieve and which is inherent in man's 
thinking and feeling since the time of his creation.
But, how can this individualistic aggressive 
tendency of mankind be held in check so that community life 
may be at all possible? Adler, no less than Freud, is forced 
to provide a polarity of motives though he is disinclined to 
appeal to heredity and innate drives. The child has at least 
a native capacity for friendly, loving response, and this germ 
will develop into a loyal co-operative spirit if the child i.^ 
properly treated in the first few years. Along with the 
important role of mother, the entire family situation with 
which the child has to cope in his first few years stimulates
10. Woodworth, R.S., op.cit., p. 301

207
him to develop a certain attitude towards life - a certain 
"style of life" in Adler's well-known phrase. Each individual 
adopts his style early in life and maintains it as he meets 
the problems of life. Thus, Adler, no less than Freud, but in 
a very different way, lays great stress on the family 
situation as formative of the individual's character.
Thus Adlerian Individual Psychology points out that
every child is born as an individual with the potentiality o*
sociability and as he grows up, as a result of his oonstunt.
interaction with the external environment and with the help of
the mother's co-operation this inherited potentiality is
developed into proper social feeling and then he gradually
moves towards socialization. So, an individual's socialization
is not anything from the non-social to the social but from
potentiality to actuality. All human judgments of value,
success, meaning and religion are founded vqpon this social
nature of man. All that we ask of conduct, of ideals, o f
goals, of action, of traits of character is that they should
serve towards human co-operation. We shall never come across
a man who has no social feeling. It is the community which
gives meaning to the "value" and "life" of an individual. To
quote Adler, "Human beings live in the realm of meanings. 
We
experience reality through the meaning we give to it, nof as
11
it is set, but as something interpreted."

What Life Should Mean You?, p. 3

Adler observes that the primal energy, w hich M s  
established regulative religious goals, is no o t h e r  than t h a t  
of social-feeling. The fundamental idea o f  religion is " l o v e  
thy neighbour", whose successful accomplishment is p o s s i b l e  
only by the fullest development o f  social feeling. 
Normal 
development in all the fields consists in a perfect b a la n c e  
between the striving for superiority and social interest.
When this spontaneous social feeling is instilled into the 
upward strivings of the self, it heightens the feeling ot 
worth and value and gives courage and optimism. 
A l l  m al­
adjustments are the result of an inadequate s o c i a l  i n t e r e s t ,  
of a restricted sense of belonging,
Adler stands firmly on the ground of evolution and 
regards all human striving as a striving for perfection. 
The 
highest effective goal is called God - the g o a l o f  o v e rc o m in e . 
Probably the strongest step towards this perfection o f  men is 
taken when he accomplishes his unification with God as the 
total release from all evils - evils of self-aggression, 
evils which arise due to lack of social feeling. 
The mar i n 
whom the social feeling has not been properly developed is 
confronted with many difficulties and it is interesting to 
note that these troubles produce in him the 'belief in  l o d * ,  
with this consolation in mind that he w ould be able to ft nc3 
or achieve his actual goal of life in the hereafter, b e c a u s e  
for him the existence on earth is a very superfluous

209
endeavour. Thus God, as it is the conception of a goal to 
get beyond the present state, is always the outcome of social 
nature ef man - whether in the properly developed persons or 
among the maladjusted ones.
Ellenberger holds that Adler's social interes- has
cosmic significance. He observes, "Community feeling is -
reflection of the general interdependence of the cosmos,
which lives within us, from which we cannot abstract
ourselves completely and endows us with the faculty to feel
12
into, that is, to emphathise with other beings."
Adler rarely mentions the unconscious and provides a 
subsidiary plaee to 'Libido* or sex-impulse. The basic thesl* 
of Adlerian philosophy is that to be a human being Is  to fe e l 
oneself inferior. In place of sexual instinct Adler p re s e n ts  
this inferiority feeling as the basic drive of all human deeds. 
The aim ©f this feeling is to strive to overcome the 
inferiority and attain superiority. For him, the unconscious 
is not a separate category, but merely a part of the pe- son 
striving which he does not understand and the so-called 
contrast between the conscious and the unconscious is only an 
aspect ef a unified relational system and does not rep resen t 
the discrete entities.

Adler has developed the science of character of all 
human beings based on social factors and attitudes of 
individuals towards life and society. Out of this 
classification of character traits he has pointed out an 
aggressive character trait in which are included vanity and 
ambition, jealousy, envy, avarice and hate. Another type o ‘" 
character, he says, is non-aggressive which includes traits 
of seclusiveness, anxiety, faint heartedness, untamed 
instincts as the expression of lessened adaptation. Thp 
genesis of religion and religious attitudes lies in these 
character traits.
Adler says, "Character is a social concept . A 
character trait is the appearance of some specific mode o 1 
expression on the part of individual, who is attempting to 
adjust himself to the world in which he lives. Character is 
a psychic attitude, it is the quality and nature of an
1 4
individual's approach to the environment in which he lives.7’ 
Adler points out how vanity and ambition which are the 
characteristic traits of individual's character give rise to 
the idea of God, which is held to be central theme of almost 
all religions. Adler says that "there is no limit of the 
development of vanity and ambition. 
It is very interesting 
to see how in fairy tales, as well as in the overheated
14. Adler, Alfred, Understanding Human Nature, p. 161

psychic striving of vain individuals the striving for powe>
assumes the expression of desire for the ideal of God-
likeness* One does not have to search far to find that a
vain person acts exactly as though he were God or he behaves
himself as though he were God's lieutenant or again, he
expresses wishes and desires, which only God could fulfil .
The manifestation* the striving for God-likeness, is the
extreme point of a tendency which presents itself in all hjs
activities and amounts to a desire to project himself beyond
15
the boundaries of his personality."
This kind of explanation of Adler seems completely 
similar to the movement of thought from Kant to Hegel, which 
revolves in a fundamental sense around the idea of m a n s  
self-realization as God-like being. Hegelianism is a 
revelation of the truth about religion as phenomenon o* man' 
self-deification and resulting self-alienation. Buddhism, 
Vedantism of India and some other oriental forms of religion 
have also preached the positive form of religion in terms of 
self culture or spiritual unfoldment. Advaita Vedanta point 
out that the summum bonnon of life is the realization of 
truth or real nature of the self and the highest perfection 
of religion consists in the realization of Brahman or one's 
own inherent nature. In the light of such views, it 1~ 
evident that Adlerian view of genesis of the idea of God is

ef a soul.*1® Closely related to this thirst for God- 
likeness is the ideal of the fairy tale Utopia Where every 
dream comes tree* which leaves upon children a very deep 
impression of reality. This gives rise to religions tendency, 
which may not be got rid of until they are very old. “The 
satisfaction of one's vanity through the misuse of one's 
desire for religious satisfaction is also found on the trail 
of the striving for God-likeness,"1* Adler says, “We have 
to only remark how important it may be to an Individual who 
has suffered psychic shipwreck, to remove himself from other 
human beings, and engage in personal conversation with God; 
such an individual considers himself quite in the proximity 
of God, who is duty bound, by virtue of the worshipper's 
prayers and orthodox rituals to personally concern Himself 
with the worshipper's well-being. Such religious hocus- 
pocus is usually so far from religion that it impresses us,
sasn
being purely psychopathologieal." 
This sort of pathological
explanation of character traits ef an individual in thinking 
abeut God-likeness is quite similar to the concept of Freud 
that religion is an obsessive nurosis, that is it is neurotic 
tendency which gives rise to religious attitude and feeling 
ef thinking ef God-likenoss. Seme ef these chronically

? 1 r
misunderstood people beat a retreat into religion, where thev
proceed to do just what they have done before. They complain
and commiserate with themselves and shift their pains to the
21
shoulders of a complainant God. 
In this process they 
believe that God# this extra-ordinary honoured and worshipped 
Being, is concerned entirely with serving them, and is 
responsible for their every action.
Adler enlarges the scope of psychology in a 
significant way. He perceives that, beyond the specific 
sexual and family factors, the question of the "meaninq" of 
life to the individual has a prime importance in the 
functioning of the personality. Religion is one of the verv 
important factors in this frame of reference. The in d iv id u a l, 
Adler says, unconsciously constructs a system of Mfiction" K  
which he finds a "meaning" for his life at least in his own 
subjective terms. He does this because the nature of the 
human being is such that he inherently requires a frame of 
reference in order to be capable of functioning as a person. 
At 1his point in his work, Adler is interpreting the 
psychological significance of the "meaning" of life within 
the format of his earlier analytical theories. Later, however, 
he realises that a concept thereof is only psychological. He 
then attempts the more difficult task of leading the 
individual psychology towards an absolute meaning of l i ’e
21. Ibid., p. 263

216
22
via his religious sense of social feeling. 
It must be
noted that while the goal is fictional, the striving for goal
is for Adler, a fundamental fact. 
If the 'goal* is
transcendental idea of perfection (sometimes referred as God
of religion) it may be fictional, but the constant striving
to achieve it is never unreal, rather innate in mankind. 
In
other words, God may be real or not, but the urge to realise
God-likeness (i.e. religious urge) is innate and an
undeniable fact of life. It is an expression of the creative
power of the self. Adler, thus escapes solipsism by hir
emphasis on social interest as innate potentiality and
consequently the back-bone of all religious feelings, viv,
the urge to attain self-transcendence. Here, Adler achieves
a limited success, but the problems he encounters are
ultimate ones and their scope is larger than he is equipped 
23
to handle. 
Thus, though Adler himself is not a true depth 
psychologist, he embarks upon a new road for depth psycho!ocy.
Though Adler has not dealt with religious phenomena 
in such details as Freud and Jung have done, theories 
developed by him may well be employed to study religion as 
psychological factor in the life of an individual and socle tv 
as well. He says that the psychic life of man is determined 
by his goal. Since, religion is said to be the wish-

fulfilment and it seeks to achieve some goal in  an 
individual's life, Adler's theories in this respect may p ro v e  
helpful in analysing religion psychologically and s o c i o l o a i -  
eally. This sort of striving, Adler says, is always 
teleological and is innate in human beings, 
"The goal towards 
which every human being's actions are directed is d eterm in ed  
by those influences and those impressions which the environm ent 
gives to the child," 
Thus in the genesis of relic ic u s  
attitude environmental factors play an effective role, Adler' r- 
theories of compensation, self-assertion and i n f e r i o r i t y  
complex and striving for superiority to compensate are b a s ic  
factors to engender the religious attitude in human b e i n g s , 
Freud says that religion is compensation. For A d le r , t o o , 
compensation is a great source of one's being r e l i g i o u s .
People generally develop a tendency to ascribe their 
misfortunes to their ill-luck, as though some supernatural 
power had caused them in which, according to Adler, v a n ity  
plays an evil game. These are the same people who a c t  as 
though some sinister deity spent its time persecuting them. 
This tendency is a source of the genesis of religious feeling 
and leads to belief in some supernatural power. /,

Freudians have also adopted his technique. The noteworthv

point of M s  approach is that A d l e r  is more concerned with
the conscious processes than Freud was. 
Adler's theory is,
25
to a great extent a theory of  what Freud called ego. 
The
ego*s desire f or power is the k e y  to the behaviour-patterns
which eaeh individual develops as his way o f  life. 
Adler's
observation in 1933 about four years before his death
represents a final statement of  his understanding of the
place o f  religious ideas in  human thought and culture : "The
idea of G o d  and its immense significance for mankind can be
understood* recognised and appreciated from the point o f  view
of individual psychology as the ooncretisation and
interpretation of human awareness of  greatness and perfection,
and that the individual as well as society are bound to a
goal which rests in the future and which increases in the
present the driving forces through the enhancement of feelings 
26
a n d  emotions •"
Since, religion and morality are very intimately 
related, let ns have a glance o n  Adlerian concept of moral 
values. 
He newer regards ethical demand as a mere restriction 
o f  human nature o r  its modification through outside pressure 
o r  an outcome of an intrinsic conflict between internal 
opposing forces. 
F o r  him, ethical behaviour is a form of 
expression which is in harmony with a natural predisposition.

All the seci&l factors - ethical imperatives and cultural 
progress - Adler tries to explain in terms of the communal 
feeling of human beings. He suggests a possibility which may 
help the individual to overcome his inferiority and which is 
a subjective origin of morality. An individual can make the 
foreign (ethical) demands his own. When it is done the 
ethical Imperatives have been replaced by the imperatives of 
freedom. Thus, the individual will not oome into conflict 
with his environment and will formally maintain himself as 
independently willing. Only then the individual is said to 
overcome the inferiority feeling and is no longer a servant 
but has become a master of himself.
Both in Freudian psychoanalysis as well as in 
Adlerian individual psychology we find the idea of God. In 
neither of those two theories God is conceived as an 
Independent spiritual reality but only as an idea. In Freudian 
view the idea of God is the idea of infantile father figure, 
and to Adler it is the eoneretisation of the idea of 
perfection, which is the idea of the goal to be achieved by 
each individual. In both these theories, this idea of God 
can be traced back as basically associated with the infantile 
idea. In Freudian analysis it can be said that childhood 
helplessness is at the root of religious idea. In the 
infantile stage (in the famous Oedipus Stage as designated 
by S. Freud) the child's feelings of helplessness in the face

220
of the adults a zoned him arouses the very desire to imagine 
the existence of a father-figure who would give him shelter 
and protection from the outward danger and difficulties.
This idea ©f God is sometimes interpreted as originated from
the father-figure in the primaeval horde theory. Adler also
*
considers the idea of God as originating from the infantile 
feeling of inferiority and an urge to overcome it by attaining 
superiority, strength and perfection. But, the Freudian God 
simply provides a hand of security, while Adler's image of 
God, inspires man to become God-like and thereby attain 
highest perfection.
Adler regards the striving for 'perfection' as an 
innate urge. Freud rejects such "an instinct towards 
perfection" and says, "I have no faith, however in the 
existence of any such internal instinct and I cannot see how 
this benevolent illusion is to be preserved .. 
.. what
appears in a minority of human individuals as an untiring 
impulsion towards further perfection can easily be understood 
as a result of the intinctual repression upon which is based 
all that is most precious in human civilisation." 
Adler 
on the contrary says, "Our experience, however, has shown us 
that the assumption of a striving for a goal is more than 
simply a convenient fiction. 
It has shown itself to be
27. Freud, S., Beyond the Pleasure Principle, pp. 55-56

221
largely coincident with the actual facts in its fundamentals,
whether these facts are to be found in the conscious or
unconscious social life. The striving for a goal, the
purposiveness of the psychic life is not only a philosophic
28
assumption but actually a fundamental fact."
Adler believes that because of reductionist bias 
Freud overlooks human urge for transcendence. But, Adler 
accepts it in the form of social interest. For him social 
interest is inborn. As he observes, "This social feeling 
remains throughout life, changed, coloured, circumscribed in 
some cases, enlarged and broadened In others until it touches 
not only the members of his own family, but also his dan, 
his nation and finally the whole of humanity. 
It is possible 
that it may extend beyond these boundaries and express itself 
towards animals, plants, lifeless objects or finally towards 
the whole cosmos."2* This reminds one of Freud's oceanic 
feeling whose significance he fails to realise because of his 
atavistic determinism.
Adler's argument relating to 'goal* is always in the 
context of his assumption that human life is oriented towards 
the future and that this orientation is maintained by the 
unconscious creation of a fictional final goal of perfection
28. Adler, A,, Understanding Human Mature, p. 73
29. Ibid., p. 43

222
in every individual• s personality formation, This goal is a 
useful fiction in that it becomes an organising principle 
around which the process of perfection, thought* feeling and 
action are unified in the unique individual personality. The 
idea of God, therefore, has immense significance because it 
has enabled human beings to organise their individual and 
communal perceptions of reality around strivings towards 
perfection,
Adler holds that the “fiction" is consequently seen 
as being necessary to human survival and development. Unlike 
the “illusion" in Freud's scheme,which interferes with our 
perception of reality, the “fiction* makes perception and all 
organised human activity possible, Adler's view of approaching 
religious ideation does not however, prevent him from util izing 
the concept of illusion. His reference to it is an ironic 
broadside against the psychoanalytic system in which it plays 
so important a role. He goes on to say, "Now that man no 
longer sees himself as the centre of world events, he is 
satisfied with a more meagre coneretization of the image of 
God and is inclined to conceive it as causally acting force 
of nature. Individual Psychology, however, because of its 
essential views would have to regard such an unpremised 
mechanistic position as an illusion, in as much as it is 
without any goal or direction. In this the mechanistic 
position is like drive psychology which is cut from the same

223
cloth.1
Beth Freud and A d l e r  advocate a pragmatic view of 
religion. 
But, while the usefulness e f  religion is 
fundamental a nd necessary in Adler's eyes, it is termed only 
transitory to F r eud with a limited application to the 
intellectually underdeveloped mass. 
In Adler's opinion, w hen 
a man attains highest perfection, i.e., realisation of God - 
likeness, h e  can successfully follow the guiding principle of 
all religions - “Love thy neighbour" - which unites them all 
and makes the m  fittest for finer thoughts and better works. 
Such persons alone feel themselves firmly established in  the 
vast process o f  evolution. 
But, Freud, While admitting the 
pragmatic value of religion to overcome mental weakness, 
insecurity, helplessness, anxiety, horrors o f  hardship etc., 
wishes that if m a n  could employ his reason and thereby 
condition hi s  emotions, h e  w o uld be able to outgrow the 
childishness e f  an appeal to religion. Thus, religious urge 
which is necessarily real a nd innate in Adlerian theory, 
becomes to F r e u d  a sign o f  immature attempt to get rid of  the 
difficulties ef  the world and consequently that which is 
considered ultimate to A d l e r  is only temporarily useful to 
Freud.
Freud interprets religien as a universal obsessional 
neurosis in describing the religious rituals. 
Just as the
30. Adler, A., “Religion and Individual Psychology" o p . e i t ., 
p. 277

224
religious^spendj^urs after hours in observing ceremonies, 
rituals, festivals, etc., the neurotics also spend several 
hours in mashing hands or feet or doing something like that. 
Though, in Adler me de not find any such mention of 
obsessional neurotic interpretation of religion still he also 
maintains this idea very clearly that lack of social interest, 
due to an increased inferiority feeling which stands as a 
hindrance to the way ©f achieving the fullest perfection which 
is no other than the idea of God for Adler, drives the 
individual into neurosis or crime.
Neither Freud nor Adler is primarily intrested in 
morality as such. 
Indeed to Adler is attributed the remark, 
"If anyone talks to me of morality, I look to see if per 
chance his hand is not in my pocket." 
But, neither Freud 
nor Adler can avoid reference to morality, inasmuch as 
rightly or wrongly it is regarded as part and parcel of human 
nature and society. Neither of them is eager to formulate 
any kind of ethieal principle or standard. They both offer 
an explanation of the moral phenomenon. Both explain the 
development of morality in individual life, and so both of 
them refer to the childhood period. For them morality is not 
an essential aspect of human personality, though according to 
both every individual, placed as he is in social setting, is 
bound to observe sense moral standard or other. Thus, for
31. Quoted in Way, L.» op.cit., p. 208

225
both of then, morality is nore a social than an individual 
affair. But, their approach is initially different. Freud 
tries to explain morality in terns of libido as it expresses 
itself in the Oedipus stage. In Adler libido or sex is not 
given any position of a prime -move r; but he too explains it 
in terns of childhood experience of inferiority. But, Adler 
has an advantage over Freud in explaining origin ef BK»rality, 
in so far as he looks upon “social-feeling" as basic to hunan 
personality. Because of his social feeling, the individual 
of Adler has a proclivity to Morality, while the individual 
of Freud has to put up a show of Morality with Much struggle.
But, then Adler believes that the values are all useful and 
teleological fictions. If we are to take the theory of 
fietionalisM literally, the gap between Frend and Adler 
narrows down. Indeed both offer for rational and dispassionate 
consideration a perspective in which morality is seen to be no 
less complex than is the moral agent itself. The enigma §f 
morality is that it is the self that promulgates the moral 
law and assumes the obligation to act according to law; and 
yet it is the self that defines the law.
The concept of * fiction" used by Adler for understanding 
religious ideation is also opposed to Marx’s analogy of religious 
imagery to “opium". Acaording to Marx, religious beliefs induce 
a kind of dream-state into which the suffering and oppressed 
human being is withdrawn from the consideration of his misery
•T

226
and from the contemplation of the means and action which 
would be  required to end it. 
In Adler*s view, the Marxist 
critique* if correct* would have to b e  turned against itself, 
since Marx also built his system around a "fictional final 
goal" o f  perfection. A d l e r  says* "The striving to gain 
strength from the divine goal always flows from man's 
Insecurity and constant inferiority feeling. 
T h e  fact that 
the form of the ideal varies is not essential. 
Whether the 
highest effective goal is called Q o d  o r  Socialism o r  as we 
call it* the pure idea of social interest o r  as others call 
i t  in Obvious reference to social interest* ego ideal* it
always reflects the same ruling, perfection, promising,
32
grace-giving goal of overcoming."
In Adler's system the idea o f  G o d  is the human 
awareness e f  greatness and perfection. T h e  formation of 
religious ideas a nd convictions within the life of a society 
o r  g r o u p  is, in Adler's v iew a n  extension ef the organisation 
of convictions and strivings w h ich are involved in the normal 
and healthy development ef individuals. 
A s  such religious 
Ideas are norms. 
Convictions are norms of human psychology, 
and not only of psychopathology. Thi s  v iew ef Adler's is 
quite opposite to Freud's reduction that religious ideas are 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms. 
But* this does not mean that
32. Adler, A., 
Religion and Individual Psychology, op.cit.* 
pp. 277-178

227
Adler is unaware ef psyehopathologieal uses ef any guiding 
Image. This will eceur whenever the image is so highly 
self-centred and non-oo-operative that it defies the 
requirements of social living and the individual is thus 
prepared to devalue reality and dogmatise the guiding image 
as occurs in the psychoses. In this context# Adler stresses 
that anyone who formulates this goal of godlikemess is soon 
forced to flee from real life.33
Adler's use of the idea ef God# as "goal of goals" 
distinguishes his view from that of Marx# whose dictatorship 
of the pnoletrait and withering away of the state foresaw the 
end of history as being attainable within history. According 
to Adler# the end of history remains outside of history# and 
at the same time operates in every present moment as guiding 
fiction of perfection. Therefore, It increasingly functions 
both as a corrective to# and as a spur towards our overcoming 
the injustice# inequity and imperfection and every social 
system. For Adler 'perfection' is a concept that can never 
be applied to life# since perfect means finished# permitting 
no further change or work. The continuous striving for 
security urges towards the overcoming ef the present reality 
in favour of a better one. The goal of perfection must boar 
within it the goal of an ideal community. All that we value
33. Ausbacher# H.L. and Ansbacher# R.R. (eds.)# The 
Individual Psychology of Alfed Adler# p. 97

228
in life is essentially the product of social interest. 
Mankind has frequently made attempts to imagine this final 
goal of human development. The best conception which one has 
gained so far of this ideal elevation of mankind is the 
concept of God. There is no question that the concept of God 
actually includes this movement towards a goal and that it 
best serves the purpose of a concrete goal of projection for 
the obscure desires of man to reach perfection.34
But, the question arises that if religion is a make- 
believe, how is it that for thousands of years mankind is 
deluded by it? Adler of course does not use the notions of 
libido and father-image of Freud but like Freud he 
characterises religion as a subjective fiction; the urge for 
religion or attainment ef superiority may be real from the 
subjective standpoint but the goal being a fiction it does 
net h a w  any objective basis. It is indeed a wonder how a 
fiction has been holding its sway over mankind from time 
Immemorial. Adler also does not explain why man formulated 
this fiction. Again, for Adler God is nothing but the notion 
of perfection concretised. But, the mere idea of perfection 
is net perhaps adequate enough to develop the notion of a 
personal God, a living God and a loving God, with whom we 
hold most intimate relations. And the notion of personal
34. Ibid., p. 187

229
G©d holding intimate relations with man is a dominant notion 
of monotheistic religions. Thus, Adler fails to explain 
monotheistic notion of God as we find in living religions.
On the other hand, Adler like Freud, does not offer any 
explanation of the origin of pluralistic religion in which 
we find the idea of many gods all of whom do not represent 
height of perfection.
Again Adler would perhaps say that man*s compensatory 
drive for perfection has led him to conceive ©f an all-perfect 
being with whom he identifies himself. But, it is difficult 
to understand why man would try to overcome his basic 
Inferiority not by developing his own superiority, but, by 
first Inventing (in fiction of course) an external superior 
being and then by Identifying with such a being. No 
explanation is offered for this complex process, instead of a 
direct and a simple one. Further# Adler also lays a great 
emphasis on social feeling. Religion operates in many cases 
as a social cohesive force, but unfortunately, Adler does not 
throw any light on the real role of religion in society. He 
admits that the primal energy of religion is the social 
feeling# and yet holds that religious faith will continue to 
live until it is replaced by a profound intellectual insight. 
We are not told what the function of social feeling will be 
in the domain of religion with the dawn ef such insight and 
why again this insight will weaken religion.

230
In Adler* s individual psychology however, the 
continuity between religious faith and scientific illumination 
is stressed over any discontinuity. His approach to the 
understanding of human psychology contains a profound respect 
for the importance of all the efforts of the creative human 
imagination to achieve orientation in a world of uncertainty 
and change. According to him, not only the higher religions, 
but also the primitive religious forms can be seen as 
contributing to human life and to our understanding of the 
social interest which is the key to human survival and 
development. Adler remarks, "The worship, too of a fetish, 
of a lizard, of phallus as a fetish in a pre-hist©rie tribe 
does not seem to be scientifically justifiable. Still, we 
should not overlook the fact that this primitive conception 
of the Universe has furthered community life, the social 
feeling of humanity, since every one who was under the spell 
of the same religious favour, was regarded as a brother, as 
taboo and was accorded the protection of the larger tribe.
Adler does not assert the "existence" of God, since 
that question is by definition out of the scope of airy 
psychological investigation. According to him, the highest 
effective goal is the pure idea of social Interest rather 
than God. Technically, then, Adler appears to be an atheist.
35. Ibid., p. 462

231
Adler's 'atheism*, however, retains a religious feeling for
the possibilities of human life, a kind o f  religious seal to
have those possibilities understood and actualized. 
Social
interest means, according to Adler, the striving for a
community which must be thought of as ever lasting as we
could think o f  it if mankind h ad reached the goal o f  perfection.
It is never a presentday community o r  society, a specific
political o r  religious formation. Thi s  is rather the goal
which signifies the ideal community, the ultimate fulfilment
36
o f  social evolution.
Adler's 'social interest*, however, is not a mere 
theoretical command for human brotherhood. 
It is a basic 
fact o f  nature, given by life itself to o u r  species. 
A d ler 
here grasps the age-old wisdom © f  religion that the universe 
is one and that m a n  can realize himself o n l y  in cosmic feeling. 
His social interest, like Freud's oceanic feeling, points to 
something larger than ou r  surface consciousness. 
B ut the 
unconscious plays a comparatively small role in Adler's 
thought. 
Ho, therefore, falls to enter into the deeper layers 
o f  the self in order to discover the ultimate meaning of the 
cosmic dimension of man's existence and his religion. 
But 
A d l e r  rightly points ou t  that h u man behaviour cannot be 
adequately interpreted in terms of  urges; it needs the comple­
ment o f  aims, purposes and goals. In function, the Adlerian 
goal with its seeret strivings parallels the Freudian wish 
with its suppressed desire.^
