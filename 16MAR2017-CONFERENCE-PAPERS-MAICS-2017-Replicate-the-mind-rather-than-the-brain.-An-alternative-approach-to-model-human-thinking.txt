16MAR2017 CONFERENCE PAPERS - The 28th Modern Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive 
Science Conference (MAICS 2017) April 28-29, 2017. Indiana University/Purdue University – 
Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA. 
Niklas Hageback’s paper entitled "Replicate the mind rather than the brain. An 
alternative approach to model human thinking" has been conditionally accepted as a 
poster paper for publication at the MAICS 2017, April 28-29, 2017, Fort Wayne. 
The Modern Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science conference traditionally serves as a 
small but vital forum in the wide range of endeavors that relate to Machine Intelligence and 
Cognitive Science. This year's theme is Hybrid Human/Machine Reasoning. A special track will 
be created for papers focusing on human reasoning, machine reasoning, and work allowing the 
two to complement and augment, rather than replace, each other. This is an active area in 
cognitive science, AI, and many recent funding areas.
