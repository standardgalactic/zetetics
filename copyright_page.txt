A NEW HISTORY OF GREEK MATHEMATICS
The ancient Greeks played a fundamental role in the history of
mathematics. Their innovative ideas were reused and developed in
subsequent periods, all the way down to the scientiﬁc revolution and
beyond. In this, the ﬁrst complete history for a century, Reviel Netz
oﬀers a panoramic view of the rise and inﬂuence of Greek mathe-
matics and its signiﬁcance in world history. He explores the Near
Eastern antecedents and the social and intellectual developments
underlying the subject’s beginnings in Greece in the ﬁfth century
. He likewise leads the reader through the proofs and arguments
of key ﬁgures, such as Archytas, Euclid, and Archimedes, while
considering the totality of the Greek mathematical achievement,
which includes – as well as pure mathematics – such applied ﬁelds
as optics, music, mechanics, and above all, astronomy. This is the
gripping story of not only a major historical development but also
some of the ﬁnest mathematics ever created.
