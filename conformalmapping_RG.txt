Preliminary Remark:  This publication doesn’t require particular mathe-
matical skills, is no real contribution to scientific cognition and seems to 
have no great relevance in science. But the geometrical figure horn torus 
is unduly underrepresented in serious publications, that it is justified to 
mention it in as much contexts as possible. After all, the conformal 
mapping, that we discuss here, and the bijectivity between horn torus and 
Riemann sphere distinguishes it as a member of complex manifolds. 
 
Wherever you apply the Riemann sphere in theoretical physics, you may 
replace it by the horn torus and instantaneously gain a lot more properties 
of the described object. And by dynamization, i.e. adding revolutions, 
rotations and changes of size, and after intense familiarization with then 
detected new multifarious and sophisticated properties, there will open a 
completely new mathematical world which bears the possibility to see 
and describe the fundaments of our ‘real world’ in a quite different and 
potentially most comprehensive way. 
 
Abstract:  For certain applications, especially regarding fundamental 
physical questions, it might be useful to replace the well-known and well-
established Riemann sphere by the geometric figure horn torus, which 
comprises much more properties, complexity and capabilities than the 
sphere provides. In this paper we will describe the analytical method for 
respective conformal mappings.

1   Riemannian Stereographic Projection 
 
There surely is no need to discuss the method and properties of mapping 
points, lines and curves (functions) from the complex plane onto the 
Riemannian unit sphere. The stereographic projection with all its 
properties and associated mathematical laws is sufficiently known. Here 
we only designate the following elements for figure 1: 
 
  M: 
centre of the Riemann sphere 
  0: 
touch point of plane and sphere (zero point of complex plane) 
  N: 
‘north pole’ of sphere on extended line 0M (opposite 0) 
  Z: 
point on complex plane, assigned to the complex number z 
|z|: 
absolute value of z and length of line 0Z 
  P: 
intersection point of line NZ on surface of sphere 
  : 
central angle 0MP for chord 0P 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fig. 1 
 
 
     |z| 
 
 
Because of angle 0NZ = /2 (it is circumferential angle for chord 0P) and 
0N = 1 (by definition of Riemann sphere) we have for the mappings from 
plane to sphere and vice versa: 
 
 = 2 tan−1(|z|)                                        (1.1) 
 
|z| = tan(/2)                                              (1.2)

2   Mapping from Sphere to Horn Torus and vice versa 
 
A similar stereographic projection like the Riemannian probably does not 
exist for these mappings, when conformality likewise is stipulated, and so 
we study sphere and horn torus separately, not for the representation of 
complex numbers only but for all cases and generally valid. 
 
Therefor we don't declare any appropriate stereographic projection and 
try to proof the conformality afterwards but we use the conditions of 
conformality instead to compile and establish the wanted mapping 
analytically: 
 
One condition for conformal mapping is that small circles on the origin 
are mapped as small circles on the target surface and therefore we 
construct small circles on both surfaces that only are dependent on the 
position of points P on the surface, i.e. only dependent on the angles           
 = ∠NMP for the sphere (see fig. 2) resp.  = ∠SMP for the horn torus 
(fig. 3). Due to rotation symmetry of both figures the rotation angle  
doesn't play any role and is arbitrary, and likewise, because of mirror 
symmetry,  can be exchanged by  −  (what corresponds to the 
exchange of north and south pole of the sphere) and  can be exchanged 
by 2 − . Even the radii r of both figures turn out to be arbitrary and 
independent. 
 
Following drawings show longitudes, spacing 10°, and latitudes, spacing 
20°, P located at angles  = 50° resp.  = 140°,  = 35° on both figures.

fig. 3 
 
 
We consider the small circle around any point P and state the condition 
that the radii dm (in direction of meridians) and dl (parallel to latitudes) 
have to be equal. 
 
Lengths m of longitudes (meridians) on both figures, sphere and horn 
torus, are m = 2·r and lengths l of latitudes (computed differently, see 
supplement for derivation): 
l = 2·r·sin                                            (2.1) 
on the sphere and, from (5.1) 
l = 2·r·(1 − cos)                              (2.2) 
on the horn torus. 
 
The differentials dm - radii of the small circles on the longitude - are 
dm = r·d  on the sphere and 
dm = r·d  on the horn torus, 
differentials dl - radii of the respective small circles on the latitude - 
  dl = d·r·sin  on the sphere and 
  dl = d·r·(1 − cos)  on the horn torus. 
 
After equalling dm and dl in both figures separately and cancelling r we 
have for the sphere 
 d = d·sin 
and for the horn torus 
 d = d·(1 − cos) 
 
By solving both equations to d and equalling we get the differential 
equation 
d/sin = d/(1 − cos)                                      (2.3) 

 
6          https://www.horntorus.com/manifolds/horntorusmapping.html 
 
 
Finally we obtain the condition for conformal mapping by integration: 
 
∫(1/sin)d  =  ∫(1/(1 − cos))d                               (2.4) 
 
ln(|tan(/2)|)  =  − cot(/2) + C                                   (2.5) 
 
  =  2 cot−1(−ln(|tan(/2)|) − C)            (2.6) 
 
  =  2 tan−1(e−cot(/2) + C )                        (2.7) 
 
with  0 <  < ,  0 <  < 2,  C any real number. 
 
C is a kind of 'zoom/diminishing factor' for the mapped figures and shifts them: 
case  → :  moves towards 2 with increasing C > 0, towards 0 with C < 0, 
case  → :  moves towards    with increasing C > 0, towards 0 with C < 0, 
conformality is given for C ≠ 0 as well, but the mappings are not bijective, when 
the constant C ≠ 0 shall be the same in the inverse mapping. 
 
 
3   Generalised Riemannian Conformal Mapping 
 
The Riemannian stereographic projection (plane ↔ sphere) likewise is a 
special case amongst others, the generalised formulas for conformal 
mapping, replacing (1.1) and (1.2), but then with loss of bijectivity when 
C ≠ 1, are 
 = 2 tan−1(C·|z|)                                     (3.1) 
 
|z| = tan(/2) / C                                        (3.2) 
 
Real number C > 0 again is a kind of  'zoom/diminishing factor' for the 
mapped figures. 
 
 
4   Mapping from Plane to Horn Torus and vice versa 
 
When we combine (1.2) with (2.6) resp. (2.7) we get the formulas for 
conformal mapping direct from plane to horn torus and vice versa: 
 
 = 2 cot−1(−ln(|z|) − C)                           (4.1) 
 
|z| = e−cot(/2) + C                                         (4.2)

5   Supplement:  Length of Horn Torus Latitude 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fig. 4 
 
 
 
The sketch shows details of a horn torus cross section, embedded in a 
slightly tilted perspective view, point P is positioned on longitude  
(rotation angle) 90° and latitude  (torus bulge revolution angle) 135°,      
S is centre of horn torus, M is centre of circle (half of cross section) with 
radius r, Q is centre of selected latitude through P and lies on main 
symmetry axis, auxiliary line MR is perpendicular to QP, auxiliary line 
PL perpendicular to diameter of horn torus cross section circle through   
S and M. With these points and parameters, we easily can calculate length 
l of the latitude with radius QP:  
 
QP = QR + RP 
      = SM + ML 
      = r + r·cos( − ) 
      = r − r·cos 
      = r·(1 − cos) 
 
    l = 2·QP 
 
l = 2·r·(1 − cos)                                     (5.1)

6   Addendum 1:  Properties of the Horn Torus 
 
For centuries science ignored the existence of the geometric figure horn 
torus completely or neglected its relevance unduly. Nearly nobody 
realized, described and applied the exceptional topology, maximum 
symmetry, high complexity and creative capabilities of this unique object. 
Now, in recent years, it increasingly appears in publications, mostly in 
context of particle and quantum physics and in connection to 
cosmological questions. The subject is developing and promises to stay 
exciting for a good while. 
 
Horn torus properties then get most thrilling when we add dynamic to the 
figure, when we let it turn, around the main symmetry axis and around 
the torus bulge, when we let it change its size during the turns, when we 
combine all these motions and when we finally interlace two, more or 
even infinitely many such dynamic horn tori with one another. 
 
As static figure the horn torus is a rather simple object with only little 
properties, e.g. one can establish the parametric form in three dimensions 
 
 x = r·(1 − cos)·sin 
 y = r·(1 − cos)·cos 
 z = r·sin 
 
or similar, depending on definition of axes and angles (compare fig. 3+4), 
and the surface area and the volume can be computed as 
 
 
 
 
A = 4²r² 
 
 
 
V = 2²r3 
 
As the horn torus is a special case of ring torus with radii R and r, all 
findings from there can be taken for the horn torus by equalling the radii, 
but all that is not really notably. 
 
The topology however differs eminently, compared with the ring torus, 
and it should be reviewed thoroughly. In respect of the mapping from the 
Riemann sphere one realizes that on the horn torus the points for zero 
and for infinity merge to one single point, what induces that strange 
topology. This property is used by Professor S. Saitoh in connection with 
his results in the division by zero issue, e.g. in our common recent paper 
researchgate.net/publication/335463208  and in other publications.

7   Addendum 2:  Relevance of Horn Tori 
 
To anticipate it first: The horn torus helps to understand our ‘real world’. 
But note: horn tori are not real, they don’t occur as figures in reality, 
regardless how you define reality. If at all, I myself only talk about very 
restricted epistemological meanings of the term, but here I do not intend 
to add any more useless contributions to the general philosophical debate 
concerning reality, only the remark that all of our many models of nature 
are crutches to hobble around the never reachable and imaginable truth, 
solely to enjoy the short, rare moments of supposed close encounter of it. 
 
No actual model of nature comprises all aspects of experienceable reality.  
We indeed possess lots of mathematical descriptions for all single realized 
physical processes and apply them very successfully, but no one describes 
all in one big idea, and furthermore there is a lack of appropriate images 
that illustrate objects and processes in a way that they match the human 
thought structure and our mental capability. 
 
Here starts the relevance of horn tori. The associated model, described on 
the web link below, tries to fill this lack of imagery, what most of us need 
for a good understanding. It’s not a theory but an allegoric representation. 
The consistent theory, based on this horn torus model, is a current project. 
 
The dynamised horn torus illustrates in an easily intelligible pictorial way 
the big mysteries in our comprehension of reality: 
 
intrinsicality of time, space and physical objects, 
continuum vs. discrete nature of space, metrisation of space, 
origin and cause for quantization, minimum values, 
constancy of lightspeed, maximum value, 
non-locality of quantum processes, entanglement, 
arrow of time, determinism, causality, … 
 
The author of this present paper provides a lot of thoughts, texts, images 
and animations concerning the horn torus model as a kind of intellectual 
game, first to exercise imaginative power, to improve abstract thinking 
and to generate lots of aha moments, then as proposal for a different 
approach to physical questions, and finally as part of an interdisciplinary 
art project on his private website:
