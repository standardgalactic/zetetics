Quantum measurement theory is applied to quantum-like modeling of coherent generation of perceptions
and emotions and generally for emotional coloring of conscious experiences. In quantum theory, a system
should be separated from an observer. The brain performs self-measurements. To model them, we split
the brain into two subsystems, unconsciousness and consciousness. They correspond to a system and an
observer. The states of perceptions and emotions are described through the tensor product decomposition
of the unconscious state space; similarly, there are two classes of observables, for conscious experiencing of
perceptions and emotions, respectively. Emotional coloring is coupled to quantum contextuality: emotional
observables determine contexts. Such contextualization reduces degeneration of unconscious states. The
quantum-like approach should be distinguished from consideration of the genuine quantum physical processes
in the brain (cf. Penrose and Hameroff). In our approach the brain is a macroscopic system which information
processing can be described by the formalism of quantum theory. The paper is concluded with experimental
test of contextual emotional coloring of conscious experiences based on Bell type inequalities which are treated
in the contextual framework.
1. Introduction
We start the paper with citation from LeDoux and Brown (2017):
‘‘Although emotions, or feelings, are the most significant events in our
lives, there has been relatively little contact between theories of emotion
and emerging theories of consciousness in cognitive science’’. We want to
formalize this contact in the quantum-like framework for cognition
by generalizing the sensation–perception model based on quantum
information theory (Khrennikov, 2015).
In the present paper, the quantum theory of measurement is applied
to quantum-like modeling of coherent generation of perceptions and
emotions and generally for emotional coloring of conscious experi-
ences. In quantum theory, a system should be separated from an
observer (or a measurement apparatus) (Bohr, 1987). In the quantum
framework, this separation is very important — although establishing
the sharp boundary between a system and a measuring apparatus is
a difficult problem.1 The brain, as a physical system, performs so to
say self-measurements. To model such self-measurement, we split the

1 It becomes even more difficult if a conscious observer, experimenter, is involved into consideration of a measurement process. The latter was done by Wigner.
He considered a physical system interacting with a measurement apparatus. The latter is under monitoring of an observer–experimenter whose nervous system
detects and propagates the signal, e.g., visual, obtained from apparatus’ pointer. By Wigner (1961, 1963) (see also Thaheld, 2005), a measurement is completed
by consciousness So, for him consciousness played the crucial role in the measurement process. The majority of the quantum community did not share Wigner’s
viewpoint; for them physical measurement is terminated at the pointer of an apparatus.

brain, as an information processor, into two subsystems, unconscious-
ness and consciousness . The former plays the role of a system
under observation and the latter of an observer (Khrennikov, 2015)
(see Khrennikov, 1998; Dubischar et al., 1999; Khrennikov, 2004a;
Albeverio et al., 1999 for mathematical modeling of join functioning of
unconsciousness and unconsciousness based on treelike geometry of the
brain). To model the cooperation of perceptions and emotions, the state
space of is decomposed into the tensor product of corresponding
state spaces,
= per ⊗em.
Similarly, there are considered two classes of observables and 𝑂sup,
for conscious experiencing of perceptions and emotions, respectively.
This paper is concentrated on modeling of emotional coloring of
perceptions. But, we present the very general scheme of coloring of
one class of conscious experiences with another, ‘‘basic experiences’’
are colored with ‘‘supplementary experiences’’. The aim and the origin
of such coloring will be discussed below.

Emotional coloring is modeled in the framework of quantum contex-
tuality — emotional observables determine contexts for perceptions and
other basic conscious experiences.2 We highlight that contextualization
is a way to reduce degeneration of unconscious states. Such contextual
reduction is very important, since the state space of unconsciousness
has huge dimension and each conscious experience 𝑥is based on
multidimensional subspace 𝑥of .
We stress that quantum-like modeling of brain’s functioning should
be sharply distinguished from theories based on consideration of gen-
uine quantum physical processes in the brain (cf. Liberman et al.,
1989; Penrose, 1989; Minina and Liberman, 1990; Igamberdiev, 1993;
Umezawa, 1993; Hameroff, 1994; Liberman and Minina, 1995; Vi-
tiello, 1995, 2001; Igamberdiev, 2004). In the quantum-like approach,
the brain is a macroscopic system which information processing can
be described by the mathematical formalism of quantum theory (cf.
Gunji et al., 2017, 2016). The quantum-like cognition project (see,
e.g., monographs Khrennikov, 2004a, 2010; Busemeyer and Bruza,
2012; Haven and Khrennikov, 2013; Asano et al., 2015; Haven et al.,
2017; Bagarello, 2019; Khrennikov, 2020a and a few representative
articles Khrennikov, 2004b; Busemeyer et al., 2006; Wang and Buse-
meyer, 2013; Khrennikov, 2016; Khrennikov et al., 2018; Rashkovskiy
and Khrennikov, 2019, 2020) does not contradict to the quantum
cognition project. However, we proceed without the assumption that
quantum features of information processing by the brain are cou-
pled to quantum physical processes. The main distinguishing feature
of the quantum information processing is operating with superposi-
tions of alternatives. Such operating can be physically realized with
classical electromagnetic waves. Genuine quantum information fea-
tures are coupled to measurements generating discrete events from
superpositions.3
We treat brain’s functioning in the purely informational framework,
so the states are not physical (electrochemical) states, but the infor-
mation states. We do not need to localize and in the concrete
brain’s areas. Of course, neuro-physiological studies give us coupling
of and to some areas in the brain, e.g., to the prefrontal
cortex. However, the distributed and physically nonlocalized informa-
tion processing matches better our quantum-like model. We neither
try to describe the neurophysiological mechanism of generation of
perceptions and emotions and ‘‘coloring’’ of the former with the latter
(see, e.g., LeDoux, 2008, 1984, 1987 for details).
Of course, information processing in the brain is indivisibly coupled
to electrochemical processes. However, as was emphasized by Liberman
(1979), Conrad and Liberman (1982), Liberman et al. (1998), Liberman
(1975) and Igamberdiev and Brenner (2021), physical reduction of
consciousness is impossible.4
The paper is concluded with experimental test of contextual emo-
tional coloring of conscious experiences based on Bell type inequalities
(Bell, 1964, 2004, 1966; Clauser et al., 1969) which are treated in the
contextual framework (cf. Conte et al., 2008; Asano et al., 2014, 2015;
Basieva et al., 2019; Cervantes and Dzhafarov, 2020). The author hopes
that this test will attract the attention of experimenters in cognitive
science, theory of consciousness, and cognitive psychology.
3 In Bohr’s works Bohr (1987), such an event was called phenomenon and
its individuality was emphasized (see Khrennikov, 2020b on comparison of
quantum information processing in classical vs. quantum optics).
4 See, e.g., paper Liberman (1979): ‘‘Biophysics cannot use the ordinary laws
of physics and must take into account the influence on the phenomena to be studied,
not only of a measurement but also of a calculation process in the real device
predicting the future. See, also Liberman (1975) ‘‘Living organisms measure many
parameters in order to have orientation in the outer medium. That is why biophysics
cannot use the ordinary laws of physics and must take into account the influence on
the phenomena to be studied not only of a measurement but also of a calculation
process in the real physical and biophysical device predicting the future’’.
2. The basic theories of consciousness
As is well known, there are two basic competing theories of con-
sciousness:
• the First Order Theory of Consciousness (Dretske, 1995; Tye,
2000; Lamme, 2005; Block, 2011, 2007);
• the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness (Rosenthal, 2005; Lau
and Rosentha, 2011; Carruthers, 2005).
We characterize these theories with the following citation from
article (LeDoux and Brown, 2017):
‘‘First-order theorists, such as Block, argue that processing related to
a stimulus is all that is needed for there to be phenomenal consciousness
of that stimulus (Dretske, 1995; Tye, 2000; Lamme, 2005; Block, 2011,
2007). Conscious states, on these kinds of views, are states that make
us aware of the external environment. Additional processes, such as
attention, working memory, and metacognition, simply allow cognitive
access to and introspection about the first-order state. In the case of
visual stimuli, the first-order representation underlying phenomenal
consciousness is usually said to involve the visual cortex, especially the
secondary rather than primary visual cortex. Cortical circuits, especially
involving the prefrontal and parietal cortex, simply make possible cog-
nitive (introspective) access to the phenomenal experience occurring in
the visual cortex’’.
‘‘In contrast, David Rosenthal and other higher-order theorists argue
that a first-order state resulting from stimulus-processing alone is not
enough to make possible the conscious experience of a stimulus. In
addition to having a representation of the external stimulus one also
must be aware of this stimulus representation. This is made possible by
a HOR, which makes the first-order state conscious. In other words,
consciousness exists by virtue of the relation between the first- and
higher-order states. Cognitive processes, such as attention, working
memory, and metacognition are key to the conscious experience of the
first-order state. In neural terms, the areas of the GNC, such as the
prefrontal and parietal cortex, make conscious the sensory information
represented in the secondary visual cortex’’.
The Higher Order Theory distinguishes between unconscious and
conscious processing of mental information in the brain. By this theory,
what makes cognition conscious is a higher-order observation of the
first-order processing. And in quantum theory observation is not simply
inspection of the system’s state. This is a complex process of interaction
between a system and a measurement device. This is the good place to
cite (Bohr, 1987):
‘‘This crucial point ... implies the impossibility of any sharp separa-
tion between the behavior of atomic objects and the interaction with the
measuring instruments which serve to define the conditions under which
the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the typical quantum
effects finds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt
of subdividing the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental
arrangement introducing new possibilities of interaction between objects and
measuring instruments which in principle cannot be controlled’’.
This viewpoint matches better with the Higher Order Theory of
Consciousness. A conscious experience is not simply introspection of
the -state.
In this paper, we do not describe the process of −interaction.
In particular, we do not operate with the states of . This can be
done similarly to paper (Khrennikov, 2015) by using the scheme of
indirect quantum measurements in the framework of open quantum
systems theory. However, it would make the presentation essentially
more complicated from the mathematical viewpoint and the basic issue
of this paper, contextuality, would be overshadowed by technicalities.
We apply straightforwardly the canonical quantum observation theory
as it was made by Von Neumann (1955).5
5 In Igamberdiev (2004) Igamberdiev considered another approach to quan-
tum measurement theory, namely non-demolition quantum measurements,

The latter is slightly generalized by representation of observables
by projector valued measures, instead of Hermitian operators. This
generalization is motivated by two things. Starting with a Hermitian op-
erator, it is possible to find its spectral decomposition and the projectors
onto the subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues, but the subspaces
appear as secondary objects. In the POV representation of observers,
subspaces are fundamental, and observer’s values are associated with
them. In our model, conscious experiences are associated with concrete
subspaces of . Another advantage of using POV-observables is that
we are not obliged to label the values of observables by real numbers
(operator’s eigenvalues); any vocabulary can be used for description of
conscious experiences.
We remark that, although Bohr’s viewpoint on the outcomes of
quantum measurements dominates, a few respectable scientists claimed
that these outcomes can be considered as the objective properties
of physical systems. Quantum measurements are treated as just ap-
proaching the premeasurement values of observables. This position
was presented in the well know paper Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen
(EPR) (Einstein et al., 1935); later Bell elaborated (and modified) EPR’s
argument (Bell, 1964, 2004), but he confronted the problem of nonlo-
cality. This line of thought matches better to the First Order Theory of
Consciousness. We shall follow the Bohr’s line of thought (Bohr, 1935)
and hence couple quantum measurement theory with the Higher Order
Theory of Consciousness.
In application to emotions, the First Order Theory of Consciousness
matches the somatic theories of emotions rooted to James (1884);
the first of them is James-Lange theory (Cannon, 1927). Nowadays
this viewpoint on emotions is advertized by some prominent neuro-
physiologists, e.g. Aziz-Zadeh and Damasio (2008).
3. Modeling of contextuality of the higher order theory of con-
sciousness
The quantum-like model of this paper formalizes the general scheme
of the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness, as the mathematical
framework for generation of conscious experiences as the outcomes of
measurements performed by consciousness over unconsciousness and
based on interaction between them.
Besides formalization of the general scheme, the model describes
the concrete feature of the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness —
emotional contextualization of conscious experiences such as percep-
tions and decisions. This model highlighted contextuality of informa-
tion processing by the brain in the concrete framework of emotional
coloring.
Contextuality can be tested experimentally, as was done in both
in physics and cognition (see Bell, 1964, 2004, 1966; Clauser et al.,
1969; Conte et al., 2008; Asano et al., 2014, 2015; Basieva et al., 2019;
Cervantes and Dzhafarov, 2020). Contextuality is a delicate property
of cognition and it is one of signatures of indeterminacy of the process
of generation of conscious experiences. Mathematical characterization
of indeterminacy is the impossibility to define the join probability
distribution of some observables. In quantum physics, such observables
are called incompatible ones; their existence is a consequence of the
Bohr’s complementarity principle (Section 7); experimentally it can be
checked with the Heisenberg’s inequality. As was shown in Khrennikov
as the basis of bio-information processing. Such measurements differ from
the von Neumann measurements. In some sense, they are closer to classical
measurements of electromagnetic waves. Although he referred to genuine
physical processes, he emphasized that in biosystems these processes are lifted
to the macrolevel: ‘‘The smallest details of living systems are molecular devices
that realize non-demolition quantum measurements. These smaller devices form
larger devices (macromolecular complexes), up to living body. The quantum device
possesses its own potential internal quantum state (IQS), which is maintained for a
prolonged time via reflective error-correction.
(2019), incompatibility and contextuality can be coupled through the
Bell’s type inequalities (Section 11).
Indeterminacy of conscious experiences is well accepted in cognitive
studies. Therefore one may ask Why contextuality has not been widely
tested in experimental research? (The recent interest to contextual
studies, both theoretical and experimental, diffused to cognition from
quantum theory.) The possible answer is that the basic experimental
protocols in cognitive studies are based on one fixed complex of experi-
mental conditions, but to check contextuality experiment has to involve
at least three (but better four) different experimental complexes. The
majority of experiments were not done in such a framework.
4. Perceptions and emotions
4.1. Perception representation of sensations
We follow to von Helmholtz (1866) theory of sensation–perception.
Perceptions are not simply a copies of sensations, not ‘‘impressions like
the imprint of a key on wax’’, but the results of complex signal process-
ing including unconscious cognitive processing. In the modern science
formulation, the process of creation of perception can be described as
follows: ‘‘Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration
and attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture of
cognition. This process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy which includes
the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream unimodal, hetero-
modal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral cortex’’. (Mesulam,
1998).
4.2. Context-representation via emotions
As is emphasized in LeDoux and Brown (2017), ‘‘Emotion schema are
learned in childhood and used to categorize situations as one goes through
life. As one becomes more emotionally experienced, the states become more
differentiated: fright comes to be distinguished from startle, panic, dread,
and anxiety’’. In our terminology, each emotion-generation scheme is
crystallized on of the basic life-contexts. Context-labeling is the basic
function of emotions. Contextualization of surrounding environment was
one of the first cognitive tasks of biosystems and this ability was
developed in parallel with establishing of sensation–perception system.
Memory is heavily involved in emotional activity, both for memo-
rizing the features of contexts and for comparison of new perceptions
with these contexts. (See, e.g., LeDoux, 2008 for the memory’s role in
cognition). Thus, evolutionary there was designed a mental information
processing system representing the basic life-contexts. This system is
fixed at the level of the brain (and more generally the nervous system)
hardware. But, memorizing a variety of contextual experiences is done
on the basis of the experiencing various situations (see above citation
from LeDoux and Brown, 2017). This context-refection system was the
root of the present emotion-system in humans. The latter has complex
cognitive functions, not only contextual. However, in this paper we
concern mainly contextuality.
Emotions represent adaptive reactions to environmental challenges;
they are a result of human evolution; they provided optimal (from
the viewpoint of computational resources) solutions to ancient and
recurring problems that faced our ancestors (Ekman, 1992).6
We emphasize that in our model emotions are conscious, cf. LeDoux
and Brown (2017): ‘‘One implication of our view is that emotions can
never be unconscious. Responses controlled by subcortical survival circuits
that operate nonconsciously sometimes occur in conjunction with emotional
6 Although we do not follow the James-Lange theory of emotions (Cannon,
1927), this is the good place to mention that (James, 1884) pointed out that
‘‘feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion. Here, for us the key
words are ‘‘the same changes as they occur’’, i.e., the complex of repeatable
bodily changes — physiological encoding of a context.

feelings but are not emotions. An emotion is the conscious experience that
occurs when you are aware that you are in particular kind of situation that
you have come, through your experiences, to think of as a fearful situation.
If you are not aware that you are afraid, you aren’t afraid; if you are not
afraid, you are not feeling fear’’.
5. Unconscious vs. conscious information processing in the brain
5.1. Unconsciousness
An essential part of information processing in the brain is performed
unconsciously; the information system responsible for such processing
(call it unconsciousness) is denoted by the symbol . The space of
its states is denoted by ≡. In the quantum-like model, this is a
complex Hilbert space (Section 6).
The reader need not couple the notion of unconsciousness with the
names of James (1890), Freud (1957), and Jung (2001) (although the
author of this paper was strongly influenced by them, cf. with the
previous works Khrennikov, 1998, 2004a; Albeverio et al., 1999). In
this paper, denotes a special information processors of the brain.
It performs pre-observational processing of the mental state.
5.2. Consciousness
Perceptions and emotions are commonly treated as conscious enti-
ties. So, in our model the brain contains another information processing
system generating conscious experiences; denote it by the symbol . In
our quantum-like framework, its functioning is modeled as performing
measurements on the system . Introduction of two systems and
matches the quantum measurement scheme, is the analog of
a physical system exposed to measurements and is the analog of a
complex of measurement apparatuses.
In the operational quantum approach, measurable quantities, ob-
servables, are represented by Hermitian operators acting in system’s
state space. More advanced models within theory of open quantum
systems are based on consideration of the states of a measurement
apparatus and interaction between the states of the system and appara-
tus (Davies, 1976; Ozawa, 2006, 2016). In our quantum-like modeling,
the latter corresponds to consideration of the conscious states repre-
sented in complex Hilbert space . In this paper we shall not consider
(cf. Khrennikov, 2015; Ozawa and Khrennikov, 2020 for modeling the
process of −interactions and generation of outputs of conscious
observables).
unconscious–conscious modeling of the brain’s functioning matches
well to the philosophic paradigm of the ontic–epistemic structuring
of scientific theories. The ontic level is about reality (physical and
mental) as it is if nobody observes it, the epistemic level describes
observations (see Atmanspacher, 2002). In contrast to quantum physics,
in our model the epistemic level is related not to external observers,
but to brain’s self-observations. In the brain, unconscious and conscious
processes are closely coupled and the sharp separation between them
is impossible (cf. Brenner, 2008 and Brenner and Igamberdiev, 2021).
5.3. Unconscious and conscious counterparts of the processes of generation
of perceptions and emotions
In this paper, we shall be mainly concentrated on functioning of two
information processors transforming
• sensations →perceptions,
• contexts →emotions.
Both processors have conscious outputs. Their functioning is strongly
correlated; in the formalism quantum theory correlations are repre-
sented by entangled states. We denote unconscious counterparts of
these processors by the symbols per and em, respectively. In mod-
eling of the emotional coloring of perception (its contextualization), we
shall consider the compound information system (per, em).
This is the good place to mention the first theory of emotions,
the James-Lange theory (Cannon, 1927). James claimed that ‘‘I am
trembling. Therefore I am afraid’’. He stated: ‘‘My thesis ... is that the bodily
changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact and that our feeling
of the same changes as they occur is the emotion’’. This way of thinking
matches with the First Order Theory of Consciousness and the EPR-Bell
viewpoint on quantum measurements.
Following LeDoux (2008) (see also LeDoux and Brown, 2017),
we treat emotions within the Higher Order Theory of Consciousness
coupled to Bohr’s interpretation of quantum measurements.
5.4. Basic and supplementary conscious experiences, application to decision
making
Although we are mainly interested in emotional coloring of percep-
tions, the formalism under consideration can be applied to the very gen-
eral class of compound information processing systems, (bas, sup).
The latter is used for determining stable repeatable and evolutionary
fixed contexts for the former. Simplest generalization of the perception–
emotion scheme is emotional contextualization of decision making
which modeling is based the compound system (dm, em).
Generation of conscious experiences (basic and supplementary) is
modeled with POV-observables; denote the corresponding classes by
the symbols 𝑂bas and 𝑂sup. In particular, we shall consider the pairs
(𝑂per, 𝑂em) and (𝑂dm, 𝑂em).
An expert in cognition may suggest other pairs of basic and sup-
plementary conscious experiences. One of the properties of the sup-
plementary mental experiences is their rapid processing. They should
not inhibit processing of the basic mental experiences. We remark
that emotion’s generation is characterized by high speed (see LeDoux,
2008).
6. Quantum formalism: states and observables
Denote by a complex Hilbert space. For simplicity, we assume
that it is finite dimensional. Pure states of a system 𝑆are given by
normalized vectors of . Later we shall consider mixed states (section),
but, for the moment, we proceed with only pure states and call them
simply states.
Physical observable 𝐴is represented by a Hermitian operator de-
noted by the same symbol. Consider an operator with discrete spec-
trum; its spectral decomposition has the form:
̂𝐴=
∑
𝑥
𝑥𝐸𝐴
𝑥,
(1)
where 𝐸𝐴
𝑥is the orthogonal projector onto the subspace of 𝐻cor-
responding to the eigenvalue 𝑥, i.e., 𝐴
𝑥
=
𝐸𝐴
𝑥. We recall that
the spectral family of orthogonal projectors satisfies the normalization
condition
∑
𝑥
𝑥𝐸𝐴
𝑥= 𝐼,
(2)
where 𝐼is the unit operator, and the mutual orthogonality condition
𝐸𝐴
𝑥⟂𝐸𝐴
𝑦, 𝑥≠𝑦,
(3)
or equivalently
𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝐸𝐴
𝑦= 𝛿(𝑥−𝑦)𝐸𝐴
𝑥.
(4)
The probability to get the answer 𝑥for a pure initial state 𝜓is given
by the Born rule
Pr{𝐴= 𝑥∥𝜓} = ‖𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓‖2 = ⟨𝜓|𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓⟩.
(5)

BioSystems 208 (2021) 104471

A. Khrennikov
and according to the projection postulate (Von Neumann, 1955) the
post-measurement state is generated by the map:
𝜓→𝐴
𝑥𝜓= 𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓∕‖𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓‖.
(6)
This state transformation is generated by observation’s feedback to the
system which initially was in the state 𝜓, i.e., observations disturb
systems’ states.
The quantum state update is the basis of quantum generalization
of classical Bayesian inference. The projection update has properties
which crucially differ from the classical probability update. In partic-
ular, it generates violation of the law of total probability (playing the
important role in Bayesian inference) (Khrennikov, 2004b,a; Busemeyer
et al., 2006) and the order effect which is absent in the classical proba-
bility theory (see Wang and Busemeyer, 2013; Ozawa and Khrennikov,
2020 for its quantum-like modeling). The author of the present paper
have stressed many times that non-Bayesian character of the quantum
state and probability update is one of the distinguishing features of the
quantum-like modeling of the brain’s functioning (Khrennikov, 2016)
(cf. Gunji et al., 2017, 2016).
In physics, the values of observables are labeled by real numbers
and it is convenient to represent observables by linear operators. But, in
fact, the basic formulas (5), (6) contain only the orthogonal projectors
(𝐸𝐴
𝑥) and association of them with real numbers is not crucial. The
label 𝑥can belong to any set 𝑋and then the probability distribution
given by Born’s rule (5) is defined on the set 𝑋. The family of or-
thogonal projectors (𝐸𝐴
𝑥)𝑥∈𝑋encoding an observable 𝐴should satisfy
two constraints (2), (4). They guarantee that, for any state 𝜓, quantity
Pr{𝐴= 𝑥∥𝜓} determined by Born’s rule (5) is a probability measure.
(For simplicity, we consider only discrete sets of labels.) Such family of
projectors (𝐸𝐴
𝑥)𝑥∈𝑋is the simplest example of a positive operator valued
measure (POVM), namely, the projector-valued measure (POV). The state
transformation map (6), 𝜓→𝐴
𝑥𝜓, determines the simplest quantum
instrument (Davies, 1976; Ozawa, 2006, 2016). The symbol 𝐴just labels
an observable (not Hermitian operator), 𝐴= (𝐸𝐴
𝑥). In principle, the
same scheme can be realized with general quantum instruments and
POVMs (see Davies, 1976; Ozawa, 2006, 2016), but for simplicity we
proceed with POVs.
7. Incompatible conscious observables
In quantum physics, observables 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 are called compatible
if they can be jointly measurable and the joint probability distribu-
tion (JPD) 𝑝𝜓(𝐶1 = 𝑥1, 𝐶2 = 𝑥2) is well defined; observables which
cannot be jointly measurable and, hence, their JPD cannot be defined
are called incompatible. In the mathematical formalism, compatibility
and incompatibility are formalized through commutativity and non-
commutativity, respectively. If observables are described as Hermitian
operators 𝐶1, 𝐶2, compatibility is encoded as [𝐶1, 𝐶2] = 0; if they are
POV-observables, then compatibility is encoded as
[𝐸𝐶1
𝑥1 , 𝐸𝐶2
𝑥2 ] = 0, for all 𝑥1, 𝑥2.
(7)
Incompatibility is encoded as [𝐶1, 𝐶2] ≠0 or, for POV-observables, as
violation of (7) at least for one pair (𝑥, 𝑦).
For compatible observables, JPD is given by the following extension
of the Born’s rule:
𝑝𝜓(𝐶1 = 𝑥1, 𝐶2 = 𝑥2) = |⟨𝐸𝐶1
𝑥1 𝐸𝐶2
𝑥2 𝜓, 𝜓⟩|
2 = |⟨𝐸𝐶2
𝑥2 𝐸𝐶1
𝑥1 𝜓, 𝜓⟩|
2.
(8)
By using JPD compatible observables can be modeled in the classical
probabilistic formalism. The formula (9) can be generalized for an
arbitrary number of observables 𝐶1, … , 𝑐𝑚, as
𝑝𝜓(𝐶1 = 𝑥1, … , 𝐶𝑚= 𝑥𝑚) = |⟨𝐸𝐶1
𝑥1 ....𝐸𝐶2
𝑥𝑚𝜓, 𝜓⟩|
2
(9)
and this expression is invariant w.r.t. permutations.
We stress that the space of observables 𝑂per can contain incompat-
ible perceptions as well as 𝑂em can contain incompatible emotions. In
physics incompatibility is often seen as the exotic property of quantum
theory — comparing with classical physical theory. Philosophically it is
represented in the Bohr’s complementarity principle which is difficult
for understanding and was many times reformulated by Bohr (1987).
However, in the mental framework the notion of incompatibility can
be interpreted very naturally: there exist say emotions which can
be experienced simultaneously; say happiness and sadness, pride and
shame; in the same way it is evident that there exist incompatible,
i.e., jointly unobservable perceptions and other conscious experiences.
We note that mental observations are brain’s self-observations. May be
this self-observational property simplifies the incompatibility issue.
The necessity to operate with various incompatible entities is the
main roots of the use of the quantum(-like) information representation.
In the absence of incompatibility, i.e., if, for the same mental state, the
brain were able to construct the consistent probabilistic representation
(in the form of JPD) of all possible combinations of say emotions, the
quantum state formalism would be unnecessary.
8. Resolution of degeneration of states and quantum contextuality
Consider an observable 𝐴which is mathematically described as POV
(𝐸𝐴
𝑥)𝑥∈𝑋. For the discrete set of observance’s values 𝑋= (𝑥𝑘), we
use notation 𝐸𝐴
𝑘= 𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝑘. Suppose now that some of its projections 𝐸𝐴
𝑘
are degenerate; dim 𝐴
𝑘> 1, where 𝐴
𝑘= 𝐸𝐴
𝑘. Moreover, for some
outcomes, degeneration is very high, dim 𝐴
𝑘≫1. In this case, a huge
set of states corresponds to the same outcome 𝑥𝑘.
Observer may be unsatisfied by such a situation; observer wants
to refine his observation to split (at least partially) the states corre-
sponding to the fixed outcome. How can it be done? The quantum
measurement formalism presents the very natural and simple procedure
for refinement of states’ structure.
Consider another quantum POV-observable 𝐵= (𝐸𝐵
𝑚) compatible
with the original observable 𝐴, i.e., [𝐸𝐴
𝑘, 𝐸𝐵
𝑚] = 0 for all indexes 𝑘, 𝑚.
We remark that 𝐵-observable has its own set of outcomes, 𝑌= (𝑦𝑚),
which need not coincide with 𝑋.
For any (pure) quantum state 𝜓, the POV-observables 𝐴and 𝐵can
be jointly measurable with outcomes (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑚) and the join probability
distribution
𝑝𝐴𝐵(𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑚|𝜓) = ‖𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝐸𝐵
𝑚𝜓‖2 = ‖𝐸𝐵
𝑚𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝜓‖2.
(10)
The projection postulate and commutativity of projectors imply that
the post-measurement state is the same for the joint measurement with
outcome (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑚) and sequential measurements, first 𝐴= 𝑥𝑘and then
𝐵= 𝑦𝑚or vice verse:
𝜓→𝐴
𝑥𝐵
𝑦𝜓=
𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝐸𝐵
𝑦𝜓
‖𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝐸𝐵
𝑦𝜓‖ =
𝐸𝐵
𝑦𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓
‖𝐸𝐵
𝑦𝐸𝐴
𝑥𝜓‖ = 𝐵
𝑦𝐴
𝑥𝜓.
(11)
The state space 𝐴
𝑘
is reduced to the space (𝐴,𝐵)
𝑘𝑚
=
𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝐸𝐵
𝑚(=
𝐸𝐵
𝑚𝐸𝐴
𝑘); so
𝐴
𝑘= ⊕𝑚(𝐴,𝐵)
𝑘𝑚
(12)
(direct sum decomposition). Thus, the observer can specify its post-
observation state much better.
The most fruitful refinement is based on an observable with nonde-
generate spectra. Let all projectors 𝐵
𝑚be one dimensional, dim 𝐵
𝑚= 1
and let 𝑒𝐵
𝑚be the corresponding basis vector, i.e., 𝐸𝐵
𝑗𝑒𝐵
𝑚= 𝛿(𝑗−𝑚)𝑒𝐵
𝑚.
In this case, the outcome (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑚) completely determines the post-
observation mental state: 𝜓→𝑒𝐵
𝑚. The correspondence between labels
(𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑚) and post-measurement states is one-to-one.
Consider now another observable 𝐶which is also compatible with
𝐴, mathematically this is expressed as [𝐸𝐴
𝑘, 𝐸𝐶
𝑛] = 0 for all 𝑘, 𝑛. The
state spaces corresponding to 𝐴-outcomes can also be refined w.r.t.
𝐶-outcomes, i.e.,
𝐴
𝑘= ⊕𝑚(𝐴,𝐶)
𝑘𝑚
,
(13)

A. Khrennikov
where (𝐴,𝐶)
𝑘𝑚
=
𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝐸𝐶
𝑚(=
𝐸𝐶
𝑚𝐸𝐴
𝑘). In particular, if, for all 𝑛,
dim 𝐶
𝑛
= 1 with the basis vector 𝑒𝐵
𝑚, i.e., 𝐸𝐶
𝑗𝑒𝐶
𝑛= 𝛿(𝑗−𝑚)𝑒𝐶
𝑛, then
the outcome (𝑥𝑘, 𝑧𝑛) completely determines the post-observation mental
state: 𝜓→𝑒𝐶
𝑛.
In quantum measurement theory, selection of observables co-meas-
urable with 𝐴is considered as specification of measurement context
of 𝐴-measurements; the 𝐴-value in the 𝐵-context can differ from the
𝐴-value in the 𝐶-context, for the same premeasurement state 𝜓. This
is the essence of contextuality playing so important role in quantum
information theory (Bell, 1966):
Definition 1. If 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶are three quantum observables, such that 𝐴is
compatible with 𝐵and 𝐶, a measurement of 𝐴might give different
result depending upon whether 𝐴is measured with 𝐵or with 𝐶.
We note that contextual behavior corresponds to the case of incom-
patible quantum observables 𝐵and 𝐶, i.e., there exist indexes such
that [𝐸𝐵
𝑚, 𝐸𝐶
𝑛] ≠0. If all observables are pairwise commute, i.e., for
all indexes [𝐸𝐴
𝑘, 𝐸𝐵
𝑚] = [𝐸𝐴
𝐾, 𝐸𝐶
𝑛] = [𝐸𝐵
𝑚, 𝐸𝐶
𝑛] = 0, then, for any state
𝜓, it is possible to construct the noncontextual model of measurement
based on the joint probability distribution for triple outcomes
𝑝𝐴𝐵𝐶(𝑥𝑘, 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐𝑛|𝜓) = ‖𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝐸𝐵
𝑚𝐸𝐶
𝑛𝜓‖2 = ⋯= ‖𝐸𝐴
𝑘𝐸𝐶
𝑛𝐸𝐵
𝑚𝐸𝐶
𝑛𝜓‖2.
(14)
If 𝐵and 𝐶are incompatible, such a model is impossible. This is the con-
textuality scenario. However, contextuality formalized via Definition 1
cannot be tested experimentally, since it involves counterfactual rea-
soning. The only possibility is test contextuality (based on Definition 1)
indirectly with the aid of Bell-type inequalities (see appendix).
If the sets of observables’ outcomes coincide with subsets of the real
line, then the above considerations can be essentially simplified — with
the Hermitian linear operators representing observables. The contex-
tuality scenario is related to observables satisfying the commutation
relations [𝐴, 𝐵] = [𝐴, 𝐶] = 0, [𝐵, 𝐶] ≠0.
However, the operator language is misleading and not only be-
cause representation of outcomes by real numbers is too special for
coming cognitive applications. The main problem is that in the linear-
operator approach the basic entities are outcomes, eigenvalues of the
operator-observable. The subspace 𝐴
𝑥is constructed as the space of
the eigenvectors of the operator 𝐴corresponding to the eigenvalue 𝑥.
In our coming modeling, we proceed another way around. The basic
structures are mutually orthogonal subspaces 𝑘such that
= ⊕𝑘𝑘.
(15)
Then each of these subspaces is identified with some value of the POV-
observable 𝐴given by projectors on these subspaces. Roughly speaking,
first states then values.
9. Resolution of degeneration of the states of consciousness via
contextual coloring
We start with the presentation of the general scheme for the resolu-
tion of degeneration of the -states. In this scheme , operates with
two classes of observables 𝑂bas and 𝑂sup representing the ‘‘basic and
supplementary conscious experiences’’, respectively.
In the quantum-like model of generation of conscious experiences
developed by the author (Khrennikov, 2015), consciousness is mod-
eled as a system performing observations over unconsciousness .
As in Section 5.1, the symbol denotes the space of -states. A
conscious observable 𝐴is represented as a POV-observable 𝐸𝐴
𝑥, 𝑥∈𝑋,
where 𝑋is the set of conscious experiences. The latter can be, for
example, the set of language expression or visual images. The values
of an observable are determined by the subspaces 𝐴
𝑥. If consciousness
detects a state belonging to 𝐴
𝑥, then it generates the conscious
experience 𝑥∈𝑋.
The space of unconscious states has very high dimension. In
reality, it is infinite dimensional, since this is the quantum information
representation of electrochemical waves in the brain (see Khrennikov
et al., 2018 for details). We restrict modeling to the finite dimensional
case for state spaces of high dimension, dim ≫1.
If the ‘‘conscious-experience vocabulary’’ 𝑋(for observable A) is not
so large, i.e., number of points in set 𝑋≪dim , the same conscious
experience 𝑥is generated by huge variety of unconscious states. This
degeneration is not good for cognitive behavior — reactions to external
and internal stimuli and communications with other humans, especially
for the latter.
How can the brain, as the self-observable, reduce this mental state
degeneration? The answer is known from quantum theory. Conscious-
ness has to complete the 𝐴-observation, 𝐴∈𝑂bs, with the observation
of a compatible observable 𝐵∈𝑂sup. The latter plays the role of context
for the 𝐴-observation. The value 𝐴= 𝑥is contextualized with the value
𝐵= 𝑦. In each outcome (𝑥, 𝑦) of the joint measurement of (𝐴, 𝐵), the
value 𝑥represents the basic conscious experience and 𝑦its contextual
coloring.
The crucial point is that such contextualization-observable 𝐵should
not carry conscious meaning which is directly related to the 𝐴-meaning,
otherwise the joint observation (𝐴= 𝑥, 𝐵= 𝑦) can essentially modify
the meaning of the outcome 𝐴= 𝑥. It is also preferable that 𝐵-
observation can be combined not only with 𝐴-observation, but with
observation of any 𝐴′ ∈𝑂bas.
We proceed with POV-observables; in particular, to enrich selec-
tion of outcomes’ vocabularies. However, the reader use Hermitian
operators and restrict all vocabularies to subsets of the real line. In
the operator-observables framework, the condition of compatibility is
formulated simply as [𝐴, 𝐵] = 0 for any 𝐴∈𝑂bas and any 𝐵∈𝑂sup. In
our POV-observables framework, we proceed with the condition
[𝐸𝐴
𝑥, 𝐸𝐵
𝑦] = 0 for observables 𝐴= (𝐸𝐴
𝑥), 𝐵= (𝐸𝐵
𝑦),
(16)
or symbolically
[𝑂bas, 𝑂sup] = 0.
(17)
In general two observables 𝐴, 𝐴′ ∈𝑂bas do not commute, i.e., there
can exist two projectors such that [𝐸𝐴
𝑥, 𝐸𝐴′
𝑥′ ] ≠0. Thus, an arbitrary
𝐴′ ∈𝑂bas cannot be used for refinement of 𝐴∈𝑂bas.
As was mentioned, for the outcome 𝐴= 𝑥the co-outcome 𝐵= 𝑦
can be considered as coloring of the experience 𝐴= 𝑥. Cognitive 𝑂bas-
representation can be compared with black-white pictures of houses in
a town, the 𝑂sup-representation adds colors: the house 𝐴= 𝑥is ‘‘col-
ored’’ with the color 𝐵= 𝑦. (Here we use ‘‘coloring’’ metaphorically.)
Conscious experiences of (𝑥, 𝑦) and (𝑥, ̃𝑦), where 𝑥∈𝑋and 𝑦, ̃𝑦∈𝑌(the
value-sets for 𝐴and 𝐵) can differ essentially.
Thus, appeal to supplementary conscious experiences given by the
set of observables 𝑂sup enriches tremendously the set of basic conscious
experiences. At the level of mental states, it makes correspondence
between states and experiences less degenerate. The latter helps a lot
in social communication between individuals.
In principle, 𝑂bas also can contain compatible observables, say 𝐴, 𝐴′
such that [𝐴, 𝐴′] = 0. In such a case, the outcomes of 𝐴′ might be used
by for ‘‘coloring’’ of the outcomes of 𝐴and vice verse. However,
the 𝑂sup-coloring is preferable. The set of observables 𝑂sup is specified
by at the level of hardware and software; need not to check
whether an observable from 𝑂sup can be used or not for coloring of an
arbitrary observable 𝐴∈𝑂bas. Another problem with mutual coloring of
observables 𝐴, 𝐴′ is that both carry important cognitive meanings and
coloring of 𝐴by 𝐴′ (or vice versa) can modify the cognitive meaning of
𝐴, since should process simultaneously two basic conscious functions.
And finally, we repeat that generation of outcomes of observables
belonging to 𝑂bas is slower (in some situations, e.g., for emotional
coloring, essentially slower LeDoux, 2008) than generation of 𝑂sup-
observables. So, by attempting to color 𝐴∈𝑂bas with 𝐴′ ∈𝑂bas, 
would consume more time and even time scale inconsistency can be a
problem.

9.1. Emotional coloring of perceptions
In the above scheme, we set 𝑂bas ≡𝑂per and 𝑂sup ≡𝑂em.
As was stated in Section 5.3, the information processing system 
contains the following two subsystems. One is involved in processing of
sensations into perceptions — still unconscious processing; denote it as
per. Another system em processes unconscious emotional states.
The corresponding state spaces denote by the symbols per ≡;per
and em ≡;em, respectively.
Generally is not reduced to per and em. But, for simplicity,
for modeling emotional coloring of perceptions, we assume that 
is compound solely of these subsystems. This is really oversimplified
picture of functioning of unconsciousness which is not reduced to trans-
formation of sensations into perceptions and generation of emotional
states. But, we proceed in this framework.
10. Tensor product formalism
Now we turn again to the general scheme of modeling of basic and
supplementary conscious experiences. Before we have operated with
the corresponding sets of observables 𝑂bas and 𝑂sup, now we would like
to proceed in the dual framework by operating with states.
In quantum information theory, contextuality is typically presented
within the tensor product formalism.7
Let, as above, be the state space of . Suppose that it is
factorized in the tensor product = bas ⊗sup, where bas and
sup are state spaces coupled to basic and supplementary conscious
experiences which are represented at the conscious level by observables
belonging to the sets 𝑂bas and 𝑂sup. These states spaces are generated by
two different unconscious information processing systems, say bas
and sup. These systems are concentrated in different brain’s areas
created at the different stages of the brain’s evolution. However, con-
centration is not sharp, processing is distributed and the processing
areas have overlap. The complex Hilbert space is the state space of
the compound system (bas, sup). In the present model, it can be
identified with unconsciousness, . (Generally has more complex
structure.)
Observables belonging to 𝑂bas and 𝑂sup represent measurements
which are performed by on the subsystems bas and sup, re-
spectively. If observables are mathematically described as Hermitian
operators, then each operator 𝐴∶bas →bas is represented as the
operator 𝐀= 𝐴⊗𝐼∶→and each operator 𝐵∶sup →sup
is represented as the operator 𝐁= 𝐼⊗𝐵∶→. For POV-
observables, we use the same procedure: for 𝐴= (𝐸𝐴
𝑥) and 𝐵= (𝐸𝐵
𝑦),
we set 𝐀= (𝐸𝐴
𝑥⊗𝐼) and 𝐁= (𝐼⊗𝐸𝐵
𝑦). The joint measurement of two
POV-observables is represented by POV 𝐴⊗𝐵= (𝐸𝐴
𝑥⊗𝐸𝐵
𝑦).
The state space = bas ⊗sup is generated by tensor products of
the form 𝜓bas ⊗𝜓sup. Measurements of observables on such separable
states are reduced to independent measurements on the subsystems
bas and sup (for 𝐴, 𝐵of aforementioned classes). The real quan-
tum information effects become visible for non-separable, entangled,
states, those states which cannot be represented in the form of the
tensor product.
7 In particular, it is closely coupled to the experimental tests of contex-
tuality — with the Bell-type inequalities. In fact, the direct experimental
testing of contextuality in the sense of Definition 1 is impossible. The Bell
test is about contextuality of possible hidden variables model beyond quantum
observables. In physics, the contextuality issue is mixed with nonlocality, up
to consideration of spooky action at a distance. Our quantum-like model does
not reflect genuine quantum effects in the brain. Information processing is
based on classical electromagnetic fields (cf. with applications of classical
optics in quantum information theory Khrennikov, 2020b). Contextuality is
a consequence of existence of incompatible observables, in the spirit of
articles (Khrennikov, 2017, 2019).
For example, let both state spaces be two dimensional (qubit
spaces), and let |𝑗𝑎⟩and |𝑗𝑏⟩, 𝑗𝑎, 𝑗𝑏= 0, 1, be orthonormal bases in bas
and sup, let observables 𝐴and 𝐵represented by one dimensional POV
corresponding to these bases, i.e., 𝐸𝐴
𝑗𝑎= |𝑗𝑎⟩⟨𝑗𝑎| and 𝐸𝐵
𝑗𝑏= |𝑗𝑏⟩⟨𝑗𝑏|,
where 𝑗𝑎, 𝑗𝑏= 0, 1. Set |𝑗𝑎𝑗𝑏⟩= |𝑗𝑎⟩⊗|𝑗𝑏⟩; this is an orthonormal basis
in the state space of the compound system 𝑆= (bas, sup). Then
the states of 𝑆can be expanded w.r.t. this basis.
𝜓=
∑
𝑗𝑖
𝑐𝑗𝑖|𝑗𝑖⟩,
∑
𝑗𝑖
|𝑐𝑗𝑖|2 = 1.
(18)
By the Born’s rule 𝑝𝜓(𝐴= 𝑎𝑗, 𝐵= 𝑏𝑖) = |𝑐𝑗𝑖|2 is the probability that 
observes the perception–emotion pair (𝑎𝑗, 𝑏𝑖).
For example, the state
𝜓= (|00⟩+ |11⟩)∕
√
2
(19)
is entangled. This state illustrate the correlation meaning of entangle-
ment — in fact, the maximal entanglement. Suppose that observables
𝐴and 𝐵yield the real values 𝑎0, 𝑎1 and 𝑏0, 𝑏1, respectively. Consider
quantum-like modeling of emotional coloring of perception, i.e., for
bas = per, sup = em. Perception 𝐴= 𝑎𝑗is firmly associated
with emotion 𝐵= 𝑏𝑗, 𝑗= 0, 1. Thus, this state represents the perfect
correlations between the 𝐴-perception and the 𝐵-emotion.
For example, consider Russia or France in 19th century, decision
maker was an officer who was participating in some social event
and conflicting with another officer; 𝐴is the decision observable, ‘‘to
challenge (𝐴= 𝑎1) or not (𝐴= 𝑎0) to a duel’’; 𝐵the emotion observable,
‘‘angry (𝐵= 𝑏1) or not (𝐵= 𝑏0). If an officer is in the (unconscious)
mental state (19), then the emotion ‘‘angry’’ matches perfectly with
challenge to a duel.
The general two qubit state given by superposition (18) encodes
correlation
⟨𝐴𝐵⟩𝜓≡⟨𝐀𝐁𝜓, 𝜓⟩=
∑
𝑗𝑖
𝑎𝑗𝑏𝑖|𝑐𝑗𝑖|2 =
∑
𝑗𝑖
𝑎𝑗𝑏𝑖𝑝𝜓(𝐴= 𝑎𝑗, 𝐵= 𝑏𝑖),
(20)
w.r.t. state 𝜓∈. The last sum is the classical probabilistic expres-
sion for correlation. Thus, each concrete pair (perception, emotion)
or (decision, emotion) can be described in the classical probabilistic
framework. In particular, by experimenting with just one pair we would
detect quantum-like effects.
Consider, for the same perception 𝐴∈𝑂per, another emotion 𝐵′ ∈
𝑂em and correlation ⟨𝐴𝐵′⟩𝜓; it can be expressed with the coefficients
with respect to the basic (|𝑗𝑎𝑗𝑏′⟩= |𝑗𝑎⟩⊗|𝑗𝑏′⟩),
⟨𝐴𝐵′⟩𝜓≡⟨𝐀𝐁′𝜓, 𝜓⟩=
∑
𝑗𝑖
𝑎𝑗𝑏′
𝑖|𝑐′
𝑗𝑖|2 =
∑
𝑗𝑖
𝑎𝑗𝑏′
𝑖𝑝𝜓(𝐴= 𝑎𝑗, 𝐵′ = 𝑏′
𝑖).
(21)
This is also the classical expression for the correlation.
11. Bell type inequalities and experimental testing of emotional
contextuality
Now let us consider the correlation-expressions (20), (21) jointly.
If emotional-observables 𝐵= (𝐸𝐵
𝑦) and 𝐵′ = (𝐸𝐵′
𝑦′ ) are incompati-
ble, i.e., in the mathematical terms, there exist projectors such that
[𝐸𝐵
𝑦, 𝐸𝐵′
𝑦′ ] ≠0, then generally it is impossible to combine these two
classical correlations in the single classical probabilistic model. This is
the complex foundational problem which is formalized with the aid
of Bell type inequalities (Bell, 1964, 2004, 1966). We are not able
to go deeper into basics of quantum mechanics. We finish with the
following foundational remark. In quantum physics, violation of these
inequalities is coupled to violation of at least one of the followings two
assumptions:
• (a) realism, i.e., the possibility to assign the values of observables
before measurement;
• (b) locality, the absence of action at a distance.

BioSystems 208 (2021) 104471

A. Khrennikov
The combination of (a)+(b) is known as local realism. In quantum
physics, one does not distinguish the two components of local realism
(but, see Khrennikov, 2017, 2019 for the claim that the key issue is vio-
lation of a) and that quantum theory is local; see also (Plotnitsky, 2019,
2020a,b) for foundational analysis of the interplay incompatibility–
nonlocality). As was argued in Section 7, ‘‘mental realism’’, i.e., the
assumption that say all possible emotions peacefully coexist in any
mental state, is hardly acceptable. Therefore we consider violation of
‘‘mental realism’’ as the root for violation of the Bell type inequalities.
In quantum physics, experimental testing of the Bell type inequal-
ities is the hot topic (see, e.g., Hensen et al., 2015; Giustina et al.,
2015; Shalm et al., 2015 for the recent experiments). In psychology
and decision making, they have been tested by a few authors (Conte
et al., 2008; Asano et al., 2014, 2015; Basieva et al., 2019; Cervantes
and Dzhafarov, 2020). This paper can stimulate such experimenting in
consciousness studies with joint measurements of the pairs (𝐴, 𝐵) =
(perception, emotion) or (decision making, emotion).
As in physics and the previous psychological experiments, it is nat-
ural to test the CHSH inequality (Clauser et al., 1969). To proceed with
it, it is not enough to consider just one perception (decision making)
𝐴and two incompatible emotions 𝐵and 𝐵′. One has to work as well
with two incompatible perceptions 𝐴and 𝐴′ and form cyclically their
correlations. The CHSH correlation function is given by the following
combination of correlations:
𝐶CHSH = ⟨𝐴𝐵⟩+ ⟨𝐴𝐵′⟩+ ⟨𝐴′𝐵⟩−⟨𝐴′𝐵′⟩
(22)
and, for dichotomous observables yielding values ±1 the following
inequality holds:
|𝐶CHSH| ≤2.
(23)
Finally, we stress that the psychological studies demonstrated that
the humans behavior differs from the behavior of quantum physi-
cal systems w.r.t. so-called signaling problem (Basieva et al., 2019;
Cervantes and Dzhafarov, 2020). It would be interesting to check
whether experiments with emotions would lead to signaling or not.
My conjecture that, for some mental states, emotional coloring (con-
textualization) can be performed without signaling. I stress that the
proposed emotion-experiments differ from the previously performed
psychological experiments in which experimenters operated with pairs
composed of two decisions, i.e., one decision played the role of context
for another.
12. Concluding remarks
We presented the quantum-like model of emotional coloring of per-
ceptions and other conscious experiences, including decision making.8
The brain, as the information processor, is decomposed into two sub-
processors, unconsciousness and consciousness . The later plays
the role of an observer on the former. This is mental realization of the
quantum measurement scheme for self-observations performed by the
brain. The state space of is mathematically described as a complex
Hilbert space of very high dimension. In this paper we do not model the
process of −interaction. Conscious observables are represented
in the operator formalism. Perceptions and emotions are described
by two classes of POV-observables, 𝑂per and 𝑂em. Perceptions are
compatible with emotions, i.e., they can be jointly observed by . In the
mathematical formalism, compatibility is encoded as commutativity.
Both perceptions and emotions are treated as conscious experiences.
Quantum measurement formalism matches perfectly to the Higher
Order Theory of Consciousness. Emotions correspond to repeatable
contexts and they contextualize perceptions and other conscious expe-
riences. Emotional coloring reduces state degeneration for them and
8 We repeat that this model has no direct coupling to study of genuine
quantum physical processes in the brain.
makes the information processing less diffuse. Context-matching is also
important for social communication.
One of the main distinguishing features of the quantum measure-
ment theory is the presence of incompatible, i.e., jointly unobservable
entities. In particular, the presence of incompatible observables makes
impossible the use of the classical probability model (axiomatic of
Kolmolgoroff, 1933). The existence of incompatible perceptions or
emotions is evident even from our personal experience. This motivates
the use of the mathematical formalism of quantum theory for modeling
brain’s self-observations.
To model emotional contextuality, we explore the tensor product
formalism by factorizing the unconscious state space into the tensor
product, one of its components describes the states of emotions. As is
well known from quantum physics, the direct test of contextuality is
impossible due to counterfactual nature of its formulation. The indirect
tests of contextuality are based on the Bell type inequalities. We discuss
the possibility of such tests for pairs (perception, emotion) or (decision
making, emotion). As in physics, the problem of the interpretation of
the violation of Bell inequalities is very complex. Following Khrennikov
(2017, 2019), we couple violation and observables incompatibility,
i.e., the existence of incompatible perceptions and emotions.
We hope that our model can stimulate the applications of the quan-
tum formalism in conscious-studies, especially in modeling perception–
emotion and decision–emotion correlations.

Here we present the purely mathematical result supporting our
incompatibility interpretation of violation of the Bell type inequalities.
Consider Hermitian operators 𝐴, 𝐴′ and 𝐵, 𝐵′. In our model, the
first pair belongs to 𝑂per and the second one to 𝑂em. The considered
perceptions and emotions are assumed to be compatible, i.e., [𝐴, 𝐵] =
0, … , [𝐴′, 𝐵′] = 0. It is also assumed that the observables are dichoto-
mous and yield the values ±1. In the operator terms, the latter is
expressed as 𝐴2 = (𝐴′)2 = 𝐵2 = (𝐵′)2 = 𝐼, where 𝐼is the unit operator.
For quantum observables, the CHSH correlation function 𝐶CHSH can
be represented as the average of the corresponding Hermitian operators
(see Khrennikov, 2019 for details):
𝐶CHSH = ⟨𝛤CHSH𝜓|𝜓⟩,
(24)
where
𝛤CHSH = 𝐴(𝐵+ 𝐵′) + 𝐴′(𝐵−𝐵′).
(25)
The CHSH inequality has the form:
|⟨𝛤CHSH𝜓|𝜓⟩| ≤2.
(26)
By straightforward calculation, one can derive at the Landau identity:
𝛤2
CHSH = 4𝐼−[𝐴, 𝐴′][𝐵, 𝐵′],
(27)
where, for two operators 𝑄1, 𝑄2, [𝑄1, 𝑄2] = 𝑄1𝑄2 −𝑄2𝑄1 is their
commutator. Thus, if at least one pair of observables (𝐴, 𝐴′) or (𝐵, 𝐵′)

is compatible, i.e., at least one of commutators [𝐴, 𝐴′], [𝐵, 𝐵′] is equal
to zero, then 𝛤CHSH = 2𝐼and the CHSH inequality (26) cannot be
violated. If both commutators are nonzero, then, for some state 𝜓, it
can be violated.
The reader can see that this is purely commutativity–nocommut-
ativity game.
