as the condition of value objectiﬁcation (VO) of σ1 and σ2. Except for a few special
triples (n, n′, n′′) this equation is violated in quantum mechanics. Hence, the EPR-
argument does not result in the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, but in a
contradiction. In addition, an elementary calculation shows that from (VO) we can
derive Bell’s inequalities  Bell’s theorem [4]

which are known to contradict quantum mechanics for appropriate triples of values.
Of course, the contradiction must be eliminated. Since the reality principle is
fulﬁlled in quantum mechanics [5], the principle of locality must be abandoned.
The resulting  nonlocality of quantum mechanics has been conﬁrmed in quan-
tum mechanics since 1980 by a great number of experiments. We mention here the
experiments from Aspect [6] to Weihs [7]. See also  Bohm’s approach to EPR;

Errors and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics
Daniel Rohrlich
According to one deﬁnition, a paradox is a statement that seems self-contradictory
or absurd but may be true; according to another, a paradox is a true self-contradiction
and therefore false. Let us deﬁne paradox to be an apparent contradiction that fol-
lows from apparently acceptable assumptions via apparently valid deductions. Since
logic admits no contradictions, either the apparent contradiction is not a contradic-
tion, or the apparently acceptable assumptions are not acceptable, or the apparently

212
Errors and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics
valid deductions are not valid. A paradox can be useful in developing a physical the-
ory; it can show that something is wrong even when everything appears to be right.
Paradoxes in physics often arise as thought experiments. For example, to refute
Aristotle’s statement that a heavy body falls faster than a light one, Galileo [1] in-
vented a paradox: Suppose, with Aristotle, that a large stone falls faster than a small
stone. If the stones are tied together, the smaller stone will then retard the large
one. But the two stones tied together are heavier than either of them. “Thus you
see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the
lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.” Such free invention
of paradoxes as thought experiments marks especially the development of twentieth
century physics, i.e. of the relativity and quantum theories.
Both relativity theory and quantum theory are well supplied with paradoxes. In
relativity theory, however, well known paradoxes such as the twin paradox have
accepted resolutions. These paradoxes arise from intuitions, typically about simul-
taneity, that relativity theory rendered obsolete. By contrast, not all well known
paradoxes of quantum theory have accepted resolutions, even today. Below we
brieﬂy review seven quantum paradoxes.
In keeping with our deﬁnition above, we do not distinguish between “apparent”
and “true” paradoxes. But we distinguish between apparent and true contradictions.
A true contradiction is a fatal ﬂaw showing that a physical theory is wrong. By
contrast, apparent contradictions may arise from errors; they may also arise from a
conceptual gap in a theory, i.e. some ambiguity or incompleteness that is not fatal
but can be removed by further development of the theory. Thus we can classify [2]
physics paradoxes into three classes: Contradictions, Errors and Gaps. The ﬁrst three
paradoxes below are examples of a Contradiction, an Error and a Gap, respectively.
1. By 1911, Rutherford and his co-workers had presented striking experimental
evidence (back-scattering of alpha particles,  large-angle scattering; scattering ex-
periments) that neutral atoms of gold have cores of concentrated positive charge.
According to classical electrodynamics, an atom made of  electrons surrounding
a positive nucleus would immediately collapse; but the gold foil in Rutherford’s
experiment evidently did not collapse. This contradiction between experimental ev-
idence and classical theory was not merely apparent: it showed that atoms do not
obey classical electrodynamics. Faced with this evidence, Bohr broke with classical
theory and explained the stability of matter by associating  quantum numbers n =
1, 2, 3, . . . with the allowed orbits of electrons in atoms. Although  Bohr’s model
described well only the hydrogen atom, quantum numbers characterize all atoms.
2. Einstein invented thought experiments to challenge Bohr’s [3] principle
of  complementarity. One thought experiment involved two-slit interference
( double-slit experiment). (See Fig. 1.) Let a wave of (say) electrons of wave-
length λ, collimated by a screen with a single slit, impinge on a screen with two
slits with separation d. An electron interference pattern – dark lines with separation
D = λL/d – emerges on a third screen a distance L beyond the second. In Fig.
1, however, the experiment is modiﬁed to measure also the transverse recoil of the
second screen (the screen with the two slits). Why the modiﬁcation? According

Fig. 1 (a) A two-slit interference experiment adapted for measuring the transverse momentum
of the middle screen. (b) The second and third screens seen from above, with interfering electron
paths and corresponding momenta
to Bohr, a setup can demonstrate either wave behavior (e.g. interference) of elec-
trons or particle behavior (e.g. passage through a single slit), but not simultaneous
wave and particle behavior; these two behaviors are complementary ( “wave-
particle duality”) and no setup can simultaneously reveal complementary behaviors.
Einstein’s modiﬁed experiment apparently shows electron interference while also
revealing through which slit each electron passes (e.g. an electron passing through
the right slit makes the screen recoil more strongly to the right) and thus contradicts
the principle of complementarity.
To analyze the modiﬁed experiment, let p(L) and p(R) denote the momentum of
an electron if it arrives at P via the left and right slits, respectively, and let p(L)
⊥
and p(R)
⊥
denote the respective transverse components. From a measurement of the

214
Errors and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics
change in transverse momentum ps of the screen with accuracy ps ⩽p(R)
⊥−p(L)
⊥,
we can infer through which slit an electron passed. But now apply  Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle to the second screen:
xs ⩾h/ps ⩾h/[p(R)
⊥−p(L)
⊥],
where xs is the transverse position of the second screen. Similarity of triangles in
Fig. 1(b) implies that |p(R) −p(L)| (which equals |p(R)
⊥
−p(L)
⊥|), divided by the
electron’s longitudinal momentum p∥, equals d/L. The longitudinal momentum p∥
is h/λ (assuming p∥large compared to the transverse momentum). Thus
ps < d
L(h/λ).
We obtain ps < h/D and thus xs > D. The uncertainty in the transverse posi-
tion xs of the screen, arising from an accurate enough measurement of its transverse
momentum ps, is the distance D between successive dark bands in the interference
pattern, and so the interference pattern is completely washed out. Precisely when
Einstein’s thought experiment succeeds in showing through which slit each elec-
tron passes, it fails to show electron interference; that is, it obeys the principle of
complementarity after all.
3. In 1931, Landau and Peierls [4] considered the following model measurement
of the electric ﬁeld E in a region. Send a charged test particle through the region;
the electric ﬁeld deﬂects the particle, and the change in the momentum p of the
test particle is a measure of E. But an accelerated, charged particle radiates, los-
ing an unknown fraction of its momentum to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Reducing
the charge on the test particle reduces radiation losses but then p changes more
slowly and the measurement lasts longer (or is less accurate). On the basis of their
model, Landau and Peierls concluded that an instantaneous, accurate measurement
of E is impossible. They obtained a lower bound |E| ⩾
√
ℏc/(cT )2 as the min-
imum uncertainty in a measurement of |E| lasting a time T . Their conclusion is
paradoxical because it leaves the instantaneous electric ﬁeld E with no theoretical
or experimental deﬁnition. However, the Landau–Peierls model measurement is too
restrictive. Bohr and Rosenfeld [5] found it necessary to modify the model in many
ways; one modiﬁcation was to replace the (point) test particles of Landau and Peierls
with extended test bodies. In their modiﬁed model, they showed how to measure
electric (and magnetic) ﬁelds instantaneously. Note that the electric ﬁeld is not a
canonical variable, i.e. it is not one of the generalized coordinates and momenta ap-
pearing in the associated Hamiltonian. (It depends on the time derivative of A, the
electromagnetic vector potential, which is a canonical variable.) The resolution of
this sort of paradox is that quantum measurements of canonical and noncanonical
variables differ systematically [6].
4. Zeno’s paradoxes are named for the Greek philosopher who tried to understand
motion over shorter and shorter time intervals and found himself proving that mo-
tion is impossible. The quantum Zeno paradox [7] ( quantum Zeno effect) seems

to prove that quantum evolution is impossible. Consider the evolution of a simple
quantum system: a  spin-1/2 atom precesses in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. If we
neglect all but the spin degree of freedom, represented by the  Pauli spin matrices
σx, σy and σz, the Hamiltonian is
H = μBσz
where the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld deﬁnes the z-axis and μ is the Bohr mag-
neton. Suppose that at time t = 0 the state is
|ψ(0)⟩=

[| ↑⟩+ | ↓⟩]
(where σz| ↑⟩= | ↑⟩and σz| ↓⟩= −| ↓⟩). Solving  Schr¨odinger’s equation

we obtain the time evolution:

.
At t = 0, a measurement of σx is sure to yield 1; at time t = T ≡h/4μB, the σx
measurement is sure to yield −1; at intermediate times, a measurement may yield
either result.
At no time does a measurement of σx yield a value other than 1 and −1; the
spin component σx jumps discontinuously from 1 to −1 ( quantum jumps) and
deﬁnes a moment in time by jumping. When does the spin jump? We cannot predict
when it will jump, but we can make many measurements of σx between t = 0 and
t = T . The jump in σx must occur between two successive measurements. When
it does, we will know when the jump occurred, to an accuracy t equal to the time
between the measurements. But now we apparently violate the uncertainty relation
for energy and time:
Et ⩾ℏ/2.
Here E is the energy of the measured system and t is time as deﬁned by the system.
(Although t is not an  operator, we can deﬁne t via an operator that changes
smoothly in time, and then derive Et ⩾ℏ/2 indirectly [8].) The problem is that
the uncertainty E in the energy cannot be greater than the difference 2μB between
the two eigenvalues of H; but the measurements can be arbitrarily dense, i.e. t can
be arbitrarily small.
Since quantum mechanics will not allow a violation of the uncertainty principle,
we may guess that the atomic spin will simply refuse to jump! A short calcula-
tion veriﬁes this guess. Consider N measurements of σx, at equal time intervals,

216
Errors and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics
over a period of time T . The interval between measurements is T/N. What is the
probability of ﬁnding the spin unchanged after the ﬁrst measurement? The state at
time t = T/N is

,
so the probability of ﬁnding the spin unchanged is cos2(μBT/Nℏ). Hence the
probability of ﬁnding the spin unchanged at time T , after N measurements, is
cos2N(μBT/Nℏ). As N approaches inﬁnity, cos2N(μBT/Nℏ) approaches 1: the
spin never jumps. Here quantum evolution is impossible. But consider a dual exper-
iment: instead of N measurements of σx on an atom in a magnetic ﬁeld, consider
N measurements of σx cos(2μBt/ℏ) + σy sin(2μBt/ℏ), at equal time intervals, on
an atom in no magnetic ﬁeld (H = 0). In the limit N →∞, the atom precesses:
each measurement of σx cos(2μBt/ℏ)+σy sin(2μBt/ℏ) yields 1. Experiments from
1990 on have progressively demonstrated such  quantum Zeno effect.
5. A thought experiment due to Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [9] ( EPR prob-
lem) shows how to measure precisely the position xA(T ) or the momentum pA(T )
of a particle A at a given time T , indirectly via a measurement on a particle B that
once interacted with A. The measurement on B is spacelike separated from xA(T ),
and so it cannot have any measurable effect on xA(T ) or pA(T ) (no superlumi-
nal signalling). It is indeed reasonable to assume ( Einstein locality; superluminal
communication) that the measurement on B has no effect whatsoever on xA(T ) or
pA(T ); thus xA(T ) and pA(T ) are simultaneously deﬁned (in the sense that either
is measurable without any effect on the other) and a particle has a precise posi-
tion and momentum simultaneously. Since quantum mechanics does not deﬁne the
precise position and momentum of a particle simultaneously, quantum mechanics
does not completely describe particles. EPR envisioned a theory that would be con-
sistent with quantum mechanics but more complete, just as statistical mechanics is
consistent with thermodynamics but more complete.
Almost 30 years after the EPR paper, Bell [10] proved a startling, and – to Bell
himself – disappointing theorem: Any more complete theory of the sort envisioned
by EPR would contradict quantum mechanics! Namely, the correlations of any such
theory must obey  Bell’s inequality; but according to quantum mechanics, some
correlations of entangled states ( entanglement) of particles A and B violate Bell’s
inequality. If quantum mechanics is correct, then there can be no theory of the sort
envisioned by EPR. Experiments have, with increasing precision and rigor, demon-
strated violations of Bell’s inequality and ruled out any theory of the sort envisioned
by EPR.
6. In 1927, at the ﬁfth Solvay congress, Einstein presented “a very simple ob-
jection” to the  probability interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to
quantum mechanics, the state of an electron approaching a photographic plate is an
extended object; the probability density for the electron to hit varies smoothly over
the plate. Once the electron hits somewhere on the plate, however, the probability
for the electron to hit anywhere else drops to zero, and the state of the electron col-
lapses instantaneously. ( Wave function collapse). But instantaneous collapse of an
extended object is not compatible with relativity. A related paradox is the following.

Fig. 2 Two atoms, produced in an entangled state at O, ﬂy off in opposite directions (solid lines)
in this spacetime ﬁgure. Alice measures a spin component of one atom at a; Bob measures a spin
component of the other atom at b. Collapse cannot occur anywhere outside the past light cones of
a and b (dotted lines), hence it cannot occur anywhere outside the intersection of their past light
cones (shaded region)
Figure 2 shows two atoms, prepared in an entangled state at O, ﬂying off in different
directions. (For simplicity, assume that they separate at nonrelativistic speeds.) One
atom enters the laboratory of Alice, who measures a component of its spin at a;
the other enters the laboratory of Bob, who measures a component of its spin at b.
After Alice’s measurement, the atoms are not in an entangled state anymore, hence
collapse cannot occur anywhere outside the past light cone of a. Likewise, collapse
cannot occur anywhere outside the past light cone of b. Hence collapse cannot oc-
cur anywhere outside the intersection of the past light cones of a and b. But then,
in the inertial reference frame of Fig. 2, the state of the atoms just before either
measurement is a product (collapsed) state, not an entangled state. Now this conclu-
sion contradicts the fact that, by repeating this experiment on many pairs of atoms,
Alice and Bob can obtain violations of Bell’s inequality, i.e. can demonstrate that
the atomic spins were in an entangled state until Bob’s measurement. This paradox
shows that there can be no Lorentz-invariant account of the collapse. In general, ob-
servers in different inertial reference frames will disagree about collapse. They will
not disagree about the results of local measurements, because local measurements
are spacetime events, hence Lorentz invariant; but they will have different accounts
of the collapse of nonlocal states. Collapse is Lorentz covariant [11].
7.  Schr¨odinger’s Cat is a paradox of quantum evolution and measurement. For
simplicity, let us consider just the σz degree of freedom of spin-1/2 atoms and deﬁne
a superposition of the two normalized eigenstates | ↑⟩and | ↓⟩of σz:
|αβ⟩= α| ↑⟩+ β| ↓⟩;
we assume |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. The  Born probability rule states that a measurement
of σz on many atoms prepared in the state |αβ⟩will yield a fraction approaching
|α|2 of atoms in the state | ↑⟩and a fraction approaching |β|2 of atoms in the state
| ↓⟩. If quantum mechanics is a complete theory, it should be possible to describe

218
Errors and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics
these measurements themselves using Schr¨odinger’s equation. We can describe a
measurement on an atom abstractly by letting |0⟩represent the initial state of a
measuring device, and letting |↑⟩or |↓⟩represent the ﬁnal state of the measuring
device if the state of the atom was | ↑⟩or | ↓⟩, respectively. If the Hamiltonian for
the measuring device and atom together is H, during a time interval 0 ⩽t ⩽T that
includes the measurement, then the Schr¨odinger equation implies
e−i

 T
0 Hdt/ℏ| ↑⟩⊗|0⟩= | ↑⟩⊗|↑⟩,
e−i

 T
0 Hdt/ℏ| ↓⟩⊗|0⟩= | ↓⟩⊗|↓⟩.
(The spin states do not change as they are eigenstates of the measured observable
σz.) If the initial spin state is neither | ↑⟩nor | ↓⟩but the superposition |αβ⟩, the
evolution of the superposition is the superposition of the evolutions:
e−i

 T
0 Hdt/ℏ|ψαβ⟩⊗|0⟩= α| ↑⟩⊗|↑⟩+ β| ↓⟩⊗|↓⟩.
The right side of this equation, however, does not describe a completed measure-
ment at all: the measuring device remains entangled with the atom in a superposition
of incompatible measurement results. It does not help to couple additional measur-
ing devices to this device or to the atom; since the Schr¨odinger equation dictates
linear, unitary evolution, additional devices will simply participate in the superposi-
tion rather than collapse it. Even a cat coupled to the measurement will participate
in the superposition. Suppose the measuring device is triggered to release poison
gas into a chamber containing a cat, only if the spin state of the measured atom is
| ↑⟩. The state of the atom, measuring device and cat at time t = T will be a super-
position of | ↑⟩⊗|↑⟩⊗|dead⟩and | ↓⟩⊗|↓⟩⊗|live⟩with coefﬁcients α and
β, respectively. So we do not know how to describe even one measurement using
Schr¨odinger’s equation.
Paradoxes 1–4 and 6 and their resolutions are not controversial. Paradoxes 5
and 7, however, do excite controversy. For many physicists, the EPR paradox and
Bell’s theorem remain unresolved because, for them, renouncing the “reasonable”
assumption of EPR is just not a resolution. As one distinguished physicist put it [12],
“Anybody who’s not bothered by Bell’s theorem has to have rocks in his head.” (No
such statement would apply to any well known paradox in relativity theory.)
The Schr¨odinger Cat paradox has been resolved several times over – with spon-
taneous “collapse” of quantum states [13], nonlocal  “hidden variables” [14],
 “many (parallel) worlds” [15] and future boundary conditions [16] (conditions on
the future state in a  “two-state” vector formalism [17]) – but since experiments
are consistent with all these resolutions, there is no one accepted resolution, at least
within nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The predictions of quantum mechanics
with and without collapse differ, but the differences are (so far) not accessible to
experiment. (There is even a proof [18] that if quantum mechanics is correct and an
experiment could verify that a cat is in the superposition α|dead⟩+ β|live⟩, i.e. if

it could verify that collapse has not occurred, the same experiment could transform
the state |dead⟩into the state |live⟩, i.e. it could revive a dead cat.) However, it is
doubtful whether all these resolutions can be made relativistic.

Exclusion Principle (or Pauli Exclusion
Principle)
Michela Massimi
The exclusion principle, introduced by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 [1], is a fundamental
scientiﬁc principle in quantum mechanics. It explains a wide range of phenomena,
from the stability of matter at the level of stars and galaxies to the inner constitution
of particles at the level of coloured quarks. The exclusion principle states that there
cannot be in nature two  electrons, or two protons, or two coloured quarks, or,
more in general, any two fermions (i.e. spin-1/2 particles obeying the  Fermi–Dirac
statistics) in the same dynamic state. Formally, this means that any system consisting
of two or more indistinguishable fermions is expressed by antisymmetric functions
as opposed to symmetric functions. Symmetric functions for two indistinguishable
particles are such that the state vector of the composite system does not change sign
under permutation of space and spin coordinates of the two particles, i.e.

whereas in antisymmetric functions the state vector does change sign under permu-

The exclusion principle then prescribes the mathematical nature of quantum states
allowed for fermions: it excludes all classes of mathematically possible states dif-
ferent from the antisymmetric ones. To say that the state vector of the composite
system is antisymmetric is mathematically equivalent to saying that the dynamic
states of the two particles are different. Although the exclusion principle is nor-
mally associated with the above formulation in terms of antisymmetrization of the
state vector of a composite system, this was not Pauli’s original formulation of the
principle. In fact, the actual origins of the exclusion principle can be traced back to
the Bohr–Sommerfeld old  quantum theory before 1925.
