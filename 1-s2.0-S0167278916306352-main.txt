The Nunez model for the generation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is naturally described as a
neural field model on a sphere with space-dependent delays. For simplicity, dynamical realisations of
this model either as a damped wave equation or an integro-differential equation, have typically been
studied in idealised one dimensional or planar settings. Here we revisit the original Nunez model to
specifically address the role of spherical topology on spatio-temporal pattern generation. We do this
using a mixture of Turing instability analysis, symmetric bifurcation theory, centre manifold reduction and
direct simulations with a bespoke numerical scheme. In particular we examine standing and travelling
wave solutions using normal form computation of primary and secondary bifurcations from a steady state.
Interestingly, we observe spatio-temporal patterns which have counterparts seen in the EEG patterns of
both epileptic and schizophrenic brain conditions.

1. Introduction
Modern neuroimaging methodologies give us a window on
the activity of the brain that may reveal both structure and
function. Despite the recent advances in technologies for magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing anatomy, and functional
MRI for assessing functional changes over seconds or minutes,
the historical predecessor of electroencephalography (EEG), and
its more recent magnetic counterpart magnetoencephalography
(MEG), is still a hugely practical non-invasive tool for studying
brain activity on the millisecond time-scale. The compromise being

the relatively poor centimetre scale spatial resolution. However,
from a modelling perspective this can actually be beneficial as it
favours a more coarse grained description of neural tissue without
recourse to detailed neuronal modelling. Indeed this is the current
mode of thinking in cognitive neuroscience studies where single
scalp electrodes (used in arrays across the head) are used to record
the activity of ∼108 neurons. Models that capture the large scale
dynamics of neural tissue are often referred to as neural field
models, and see [1] for a recent discussion.
The model is, in its most general setting, described as a dy-
namical system with space-dependent delays that invariably is
thought of as an integro-differential equation—which reduces to
a damped inhomogeneous wave equation for a particular choice of
exponentially decaying spatial interactions. Perhaps, Paul Nunez
was one of the first to realise the importance of modelling the
long range cortico–cortico connections for generating the all im-
portant α-rhythm of EEG (an 8–13 Hz frequency) [2]. Moreover, he

recognised that because the cortical white matter system is topo-
logically close to a sphere that a model that respected this (with
periodic boundaries) should naturally produce standing waves (via
interference) [3,4]. For a more recent perspective on this work
see [5].
Given the importance assigned by Nunez to the boundary
conditions [6], the model has, surprisingly, been studied more
often than not in scenarios that have different topologies to that
of the sphere, e.g. [7–10]. Understandably this facilitates both
mathematical and numerical analyses, though the results have less
relevance to the application of standing waves seen in EEG. One
exception to this is the numerical study of Jirsa et al. [11], though
even here analysis and simulations are performed by using the
less general partial differential equation (PDE) formulation of the
model. Despite the significance of geometry in the Nunez model for
understanding EEG, a thorough exploration of its pattern forming
properties has not been performed since its inception roughly forty
years ago. In this paper we undertake a first step along this path.
1.1. Neural fields and symmetry
Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in dynamical systems
goes hand in hand with identifying the various symmetries in
the model. Both the internal structure of the model, lattice-
structure for example, and the domain under consideration, e.g. a
disk, will impact the system’s symmetries. Since neural fields are
primarily studied on either infinite or periodic domains, the group
of translations and rotations (Euclidean group) arises naturally
in this setting. Ermentrout and Cowan used this to good effect
in developing their original model for visual hallucinations in
primary visual cortex (V1), arising from a Turing instability [12].
Apart from describing the time-evolution of activity in a strictly
anatomical space, neural fields have been extended to ‘feature
spaces’, which allow one to represent abstract attributes of neural
activity. An outstanding example of this are the models of V1
of Cowan and collaborators, who included the cortical columns’
orientation preference for visual input in the framework of neural
fields. A detailed analysis of the shift-twist symmetry group, which
is at the heart of these models, has yielded an understanding on
the origin of visual hallucinations characterised as lattices of locally
oriented contours or edges [13,14]. Extending the model to account
for spatial frequency preference of the visual stimuli, a feature
distinct from the orientation, has also resulted in the formulation
of a neural field on a sphere [15]. Yet the differences with Nunez’
interpretation are marked: Nunez focuses on direct anatomical
connectivity rather than interactions in an abstract feature space.
In this work, we follow Nunez and take the sphere as the physical
domain of the neural field.
Spherical symmetries have a long history of application, e.g.
they play a role in morphogenesis (how an initial spherical ball
of cells develops into a mature shape) [16], as well many other
biological and physical systems including the understanding of
tumour growth [17], sphere buckling under pressure [18], and
Rayleigh–Bénard convection in a spherical shell [19] to give but
a few examples. Typical models for these systems take the form
of PDEs, such as reaction–diffusion or Swift–Hohenberg, and
the techniques for understanding bifurcations from spherically
symmetric states have included group theory [20], scientific
computation [21] and Turing instability analysis [22]. For a further
discussion we refer the reader to the article by Matthews [23].
1.2. Role of time delays
In contrast to other studies of pattern formation on a sphere we
are concerned not with PDEs, but rather with non-local models.
The Nunez model can be parsimoniously expressed as an integro-
differential equation with time delays. Although the very first
formulations of neural fields already include transmission de-
lays [24,25], they have often been disregarded in rigorous analysis,
due to lack of a proper mathematical setting for these problems.
Recently, Faugeras and collaborators made their first steps in for-
mulating a rigorous framework for these models [26–28]. Subse-
quently, van Gils et al. proved that this class of dynamical systems
can be cast as abstract delay differential equations [29]. As a re-
sult of this, many of the mathematical techniques developed for
the analysis of ODEs and PDEs, such as Turing analysis, symmetric
bifurcation theory, and centre manifold reduction can be adapted
for use in the delayed integro-differential equation we study in this
article.
In [30] a delayed neural field is studied on a one-dimensional
interval and symmetries are used to simplify the computations of
spectral values and normal form coefficients for a pitchfork–Hopf
bifurcation. The inhomogeneities in their model (i.e. the bound-
aries) complicate the analytical computation of eigenfunctions and
critical normal form coefficients—numerics have to be used in-
stead. As a contrast, we will employ a Turing analysis in this pa-
per, which enables us to express the eigenfunctions in closed form
using spherical harmonics. Consequently, we are able to identify
closed expressions for the critical normal form coefficients, where
numerics are only required for computing the eigenvalues as a so-
lution of a transcendental equation (which is common practice for
delayed systems).
Although we are able to perform the centre manifold reduction
with minimal numerical effort, forward-time simulations of the
model are a whole different challenge. Indeed, the toolbox of
numerical schemes is as yet relatively underdeveloped and so
here we apply a novel scheme for the simulation of (discretised)
integro-differential equations on large meshes [31]: linear features
of Cubic-Hermite spline interpolation and numerical integration
are exploited to express the majority of operations in sparse
matrix–vector products.
1.3. Outline
In Section 2 we give a brief review of the relevant neocortical
anatomy and physiology to set the scene for the mathematical
formulation of the large-scale Nunez model of EEG. We consider
the case that the anatomical connectivity function is invariant
with respect to the symmetry group of the sphere and show
this can naturally be constructed using a spherical harmonic
basis set. The non-instantaneous interaction between cortical
regions is described with the use of a space-dependent delay
determined by the speed of an action potential along an axonal
fibre. Next in Section 3 we perform a linear Turing analysis of the
steady state to show that both spatial and spatio-temporal neural
activity patterns can occur (as linear combinations of spherical
harmonics), depending on the precise shape of the connectivity
function and the speed of the action potential. The techniques from
equivariant bifurcation theory, which enable us to identify the
possible planforms that can arise at the bifurcation, are reviewed
in Section 4. Similarly, in Section 5 we offer a comprehensive
overview of the framework of sun–star calculus that is required
to perform the centre manifold reduction and critical normal form
computation in neural fields with time delays. We apply these
techniques to our model in Section 6 to obtain explicit expressions
for the critical normal form coefficients, which enable us to classify
the system’s bifurcation. In particular, we determine the first
Lyapunov coefficient of a Hopf bifurcation and, by continuation,
we subsequently find two different codimension two bifurcations:
a generalised Hopf bifurcation and a double Hopf bifurcation.
Both bifurcations give rise to bistability in the system, which we
investigate analytically as well as numerically. Finally in Section 7
we discuss natural extensions of the work in this paper.

2. A model of cortex with axonal delays
The columnar organisation of the neocortex has been appre-
ciated for some time, and for a review see [32]. These (internally
connected) macrocolumns consist of ∼106 neurons with similar
response properties and tend to be vertically aligned into colum-
nar arrangements of roughly 1–3 mm in diameter. Columns in cor-
tical areas located far from one another, but with some common
properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections
(1–15 cm). Thus, to a first approximation the cortex is often viewed
as being built from a dense reciprocally interconnected network
of corticocortical axonal pathways, of which there are typically
1010 in a human brain [33]. These fibres make connections within
the roughly 3 mm outer layer of the cerebrum, and this wrinkled
and folded cortical structure contains about 1010 neurons. Approx-
imately 80% of these connections are excitatory and the remainder
inhibitory. Excitatory pyramidal cells generally send their myeli-
nated axons to other parts of the cortex (forming the white mat-
ter), so that most long-range synaptic interactions are excitatory.
Roughly 95% of these connections target the same cerebral hemi-
sphere, whilst the remaining ones either cross the corpus callosum
to the other hemisphere or connect to the thalamus. In contrast
inhibitory interactions tend to be much more short-ranged. It is
the combination of local synaptic activity and non-local interac-
tions within the cortex that is believed to be the major source of
large-scale EEG and MEG signals recorded at (or near) the scalp.
Perhaps the most definitive model of EEG generation to date
is that of Paul Nunez (reviewed in [4]), which has culminated
in the brain-wave equation for EEG generation. Indeed this and
more general neural field models (reviewed in [1]) are the major
frameworks for the forward generation of EEG signals. At heart
these modern biophysical theories assert that EEG signals from
a single scalp electrode arise from the coordinated activity of
pyramidal cells in cortex [34]. EEG resolution (from the scalp)
is typically in the 6 cm range for unprocessed EEG and 2–3 cm
for high resolution EEG [35]. Thus the number of neurons
contributing to each scalp electrode is expected to be roughly
109 for unprocessed EEG and 108 for high resolution EEG. These
are arranged with their dendrites in parallel and perpendicular to
the cortical surface. When synchronously activated by synapses
at the distal dendrites extracellular current flows (parallel to the
dendrites), with a net membrane current at the synapse. For
excitatory (inhibitory) synapses this creates a sink (source) with
a negative (positive) extracellular potential. Because there is no
accumulation of charge in the tissue this distal synaptic current
is compensated by other currents flowing in the medium causing
a distributed source in the case of a sink and vice versa for a
synapse that acts as a source. Hence, at the population level the
potential field generated by a synchronously activated population
of cortical pyramidal cells behaves like that of a dipole layer. The
interneurons’ contribution to the electrical field, on the other hand,
is negligible due to both the small cell volume and the lack of a clear
dipolar (or other orientation-dominant) morphology.
Nunez has convincingly argued that the dynamics of neural
membrane alone cannot credibly account for the robust human
EEG rhythms seen in the 1–15 Hz range, primarily because there
is no such thing as a fixed membrane time constant in vivo (since
for voltage gated membrane ion channels this is a time and state
dependent attribute). However, local delays arising from synaptic
processing (seen in the rise and decay of post synaptic potentials)
as well as global delays arising from action potential propagation
along corticocortical fibres are believed to be far more important.
The former typically have time-scales from 1 to 100 ms and the
latter of up to 30 ms in humans. The Nunez model of EEG re-
spects the physiology and anatomy described above and has been
particularly successful for describing standing EEG waves. Indeed
these motivate one form of the model as a damped inhomoge-
neous wave equation whereby standing waves arise naturally by
interference in a system with periodic boundary conditions. Nunez
considered each cortical hemisphere (together with its white mat-
ter connections) to be topologically equivalent to a sphere, with
the speed of an action potential fixed for all fibres—thus ignor-
ing known anisotropy in the form of a preferred anterior–posterior
orientation [3,4]. The radius of each cortical hemisphere was cal-
culated from the known surface area of ∼800–1500 cm2 as R =
√
A/(4π) ∼8–10 cm. Taking a value for the corticocortical ac-
tion potential speed in the range v ∼6–9 m/s Nunez used sim-
ple interference arguments (using an analogy with vibrations on a
string) to predict that fundamental cortical frequencies (for stand-
ing waves) would lie in the range f ∼13–25 Hz, using the rela-
tionship f = v/(
√
2πR). Another version of the model takes the
form of an integro-differential equation and it is this formulation
of the model that we shall consider in this paper.
2.1. The model
Here we give a modern perspective on the Nunez model in
its integral form. Using some artistic licence we also slightly
generalise it to include a simple model of synaptic processing, to
bring it more in line with popular formulations of neural field
theories. For a review of these we refer the reader to the recent
book [36].
We represent synaptic activity by u = u(t, r) ∈R where r is
a point on the surface of a sphere and t ∈R+. We shall consider
simple neural field models that, after rescaling time and space, can
be written in the form
∂u(t, r)
∂t
= −u(t, r) + Φ(t, r)
(1)
with either
Φ(t, r) =

Ω
w(r, r′)f ◦u(t −τ(r, r′), r′)dr′,
(2a)
or
Φ(t, r) = f ◦

Ω
w(r, r′)u(t −τ(r, r′), r′)dr′.
(2b)
We also have to specify the initial condition:
u(t) = η(t),
t ∈[−h, 0],
(2c)
where η ∈X, the state space defined below.
Here Ω:= S2 is the surface of the unit sphere in R3, dr′ the
integration measure and ◦denotes function composition, with f a
firing rate function. The weight distribution w(r, r′) specifies the
anatomical connectivity between points r and r′, whilst τ(r, r′)
specifies the corresponding delay arising from the finite speed
of the action potential travelling along the fibre connecting the
two points. The model defined by (2a) is often referred to as a
voltage based model, whereas (2b) is referred to as an activity
based model [37]. In either case the models are qualitatively similar
in their behaviour, and the analytical and numerical techniques we
develop throughout this paper can be adapted to either case. For
concreteness we shall work with (2a).
2.2. Functional analytic setting
Throughout this paper we fix the following assumptions:
• the firing rate function f is smooth and bounded on R,
• the domain Ω:= S2 is the unit sphere in R3 and the correspond-
ing metric d is the great circle distance,

30
S. Visser et al. / Physica D 349 (2017) 27–45
• the connectivity kernel w ∈C0,α(Ω× Ω), the Banach space of
Hölder continuous functions with exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1 on
Ω× Ω.
• the delay function τ ∈C0,α(Ω× Ω) is non-negative and not
identically zero,
• the maximal delay h := sup{τ(r, r′) : r, r′ ∈Ω},
• the spatial space V := C0,α(Ω, C) the Banach space of Hölder
continuous functions with exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1, with the
standard norm:
∥v∥V := sup
r∈Ω
|v(r)| + sup
r̸=r′∈Ω
|v(r) −v(r′)|
d(r, r′)α
,
• the state space X := C0,1([−h, 0], V) the Banach space of Lips-
chitz continuous functions with the standard norm:
∥x∥X :=
sup
t∈[−h,0]
∥x(t, ·)∥V +
sup
t̸=t′∈[−h,0]
∥x(t, ·) −x(t′, ·)∥V
|t −t′|
,
and
• a function u ∈C([−h, ∞), V) ∩C1([0, ∞), V) that satisfies (1)
with initial condition η ∈X is a global solution.
These assumptions are nearly identical to those in the seminal
work [29], apart from one: where the original work sets the spatial
space V as the continuous functions, we have chosen the Hölder
continuous functions instead. This additional constraint on the
spatial domain is in our case required to guarantee the convergence
of the spherical harmonics expansion (see next section). Moreover,
we point out this change of spatial function space has no apparent
impact on the outcomes of the original work and a discussion of
these minute adjustments is therefore omitted.
We include for completeness the proofs of two lemmas that
guarantee that the equations (1) + (2a) + (2c) are well-posed.
Using the notations of [29], define the nonlinear operator G : X →
V as
G(u)(r) =

We have the following lemma.

Using the definition of the operator G, the system (1) + (2a) +

Then (4) is of the form of a Delayed Differential Equation when we
define F : X →V by
F(Ψ ) = −Ψ (0) + G(Ψ )
∀Ψ ∈X.
(5)
It is then well-known that (4) has a unique solution or equivalently
that (1) + (2a) + (2c) has a unique global solution if the operator
F defined by (5) is Lipschitz continuous. We prove the following
lemma.

2.3. Spherical geometry
For the remainder of this paper we will assume that r = r(θ, φ)
∈S2 is a point on the sphere with polar angle θ ∈[0, π], azimuthal
angle φ ∈[0, 2π) and radius 1 and similar for r′. Furthermore,
we make use of the complex-valued spherical harmonics Y m
n (r) of

S. Visser et al. / Physica D 349 (2017) 27–45
31
degree n ≥0 and order|m| ≤n, for which a representation is given
in Appendix A. As much as Fourier series form an orthonormal basis
on the circle, spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis on
the sphere.
Theorem 1 (Spherical Harmonics Expansion [38, Thm. 5]). Let v ∈V,
then the spherical harmonics expansion of v converges uniformly to
v, that is for N →∞

where the overline denotes complex conjugation.
Proof. We give a very short proof for completeness. Let PN be the

n and EN(v)
be the infinite norm of the difference v −PN(v):
EN(v) = sup

|(v −PN(v))(r)| .
Ref. [39, Cor. 2.2] implies that EN(v)
≤
C∥v∥V N−α, while
Ref. [38, Thm. 4] implies that the operator norm ∥PN∥of the linear
operator PN w.r.t. the uniform norm on V satisfies ∥PN∥= O(N1/2).
Finally [38, Thm. 1] shows that ∥v −PN(v)∥∞≤(1 + ∥PN∥)EN(v)
and this yields
∥v −PN(v)∥∞= O(N−α+1/2),
hence the uniform convergence on Ωof PN(v) to v when N →
∞.

We shall consider a homogeneous neural field, where both the
weight kernel w(r, r′) and transmission delays τ(r, r′) depend on
the relative position of r and r′. Naturally, w and τ are chosen as
functions of distance along the surface, but more generally we set
w(r, r′) := w(r · r′)
and
τ(r, r′) := τ(r · r′).
(10)
We remark that, on a unit sphere, the inner product is equal to
the cosine of the angular separation (and therefore great circle
distance) between two points; i.e. cos(α) = r · r′. This leads to
the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Let g be a Hölder continuous function on [−1, 1] with
exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1, and G(r, r′) = g(r · r′). Then the series

We note that a similar mathematical representation has
previously been used in [14,15] for a neural field model describing
orientation and spatial frequency tuning in a cortical hypercolumn.
However, the physical differences between our studies are marked,
with ours focusing on direct anatomical connectivity rather than
interactions in a neural feature space.
2.4. Concrete choices
While the majority of the following results are independent of
the specific choices for f , w and τ, we will illustrate our results
with concrete choices in computations and simulations. Where
required, we choose the following forms.
The firing rate function is sigmoidal and increasing:
f (u) =
α
1 + e−β(u−δ) ,
(15)
with steepness parameter β > 0 and threshold δ.

with σ1 > σ2 > σmin > 0 and J1J2 < 0. For J1 + J2 > 0 we have
a wizard-hat shape, whilst for J1 + J2 < 0 we have an inverted
wizard-hat shape.
We have the following lemma.
Lemma 3. The function w : [−1, 1] →R defined by (16) is Hölder
continuous with exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1.
Proof. The space of Hölder continuous functions with the same

Furthermore, we call the synaptic kernel balanced if

Other choices than (16), such as a difference of Gaussians, are also
natural.
A common choice for the transmission delay is
τ(s) = τ0 +

,
(17)
which incorporates both a constant offset delay τ0 and a constant
propagation speed c of action potentials. An onset delay has
been shown to lead to dynamics reminiscent of those seen
in simulations of large-scale spiking networks [41], and its
physiological interpretation can be connected to the relaxation
time-scale for which spiking networks can reasonably allow for a
firing rate description. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 4. The function τ defined by (17) is Hölder continuous with
exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1.
Proof. It follows from the proof of Lemma 3 that τ is Hölder
continuous with exponent α, 1/2 < α ≤1.
□
3. Linear stability analysis
It is sensible to begin the investigation of the spherical Nunez
model with a standard Turing analysis, treating the instability
of a homogeneous steady state. This will allow us to determine
the conditions for the onset of spatial patterned states or more
dynamic spatio-temporal patterns in the form of standing or
travelling waves. This approach has a long tradition in neural field
modelling, as exemplified in [12,42,13] and reviewed in [37,43].
A one-dimensional system with space-dependent delays and
periodic domain is studied in [28] using the same methodology.
3.1. Spectral problem
Stability and pattern formation in the model are dictated by
the spectral values, or eigenvalues, of the semigroup generator
underlying the dynamical system. We continue with a heuristic
derivation of a set of characteristic equations En(λ) whose roots
are the eigenvalues of (1) + (2a). A detailed treatise on the validity
of our result, as well as special properties of the spectral problem,
is available in [29].
A homogeneous steady state u(t, r) = ˆu of (1) + (2a) satisfies
ˆu = w0f (ˆu).
(18)
For our choice (15), up to three homogeneous equilibria might be
present. Note that in the special case that the kernel is balanced,
i.e. w0 = 0, ˆu = 0 is the only homogeneous equilibrium.
Linearising (1) + (2a) around ˆu gives
∂v(t, r)
∂t
= −v(t, r) + κ

Ω
w(r · r′)v(t −τ(r · r′), r′) dr′,
(19)
where κ = f ′(ˆu). Solutions of this linear equation are separable
and we set ξ(t, r) = eµtq(r). In this case q(r) satisfies the linear
equation ∆(µ)q = 0 where
(∆(µ)q)(r) := (µ + 1)q(r) −κ

Ω
G(r, r′; µ)q(r′)dr′,
(20)
is the characteristic function with G(r, r′; µ) = w(r · r′) exp
(−µτ(r · r′)). Note that the particular structure of G allows
application of Theorem 2, which yields coefficients Gn(µ)—see
Appendix B. Indeed, Lemmas 3 and 4 show that the functions w and
τ, [−1, 1] →R are Hölder continuous with exponent α, 1/2 <
α ≤1. It is then easily verified that the function [−1, 1] →R,
s →w(s)e−µτ(s) is also Hölder continuous with exponent α, and
the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2 shows that the function
Ω×Ω→R, (r, r′) →w(r·r′)e−µτ(r·r′) is Hölder continuous with
exponent α. Now, λ is an eigenvalue of (19) if ∆(λ) has non-trivial
solutions. This occurs when
En(λ) := λ + 1 −κGn(λ) = 0,
(21)
for some n ≥
0. In this case, (19) has 2n + 1 solutions (i.e.
eigenfunctions) of the form ξm(t, r) = eλtY m
n (r), m = −n, . . . , n.
Hence, the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalues
are the same.
The spectrum σ := σp ∩σess corresponding to (19) consists
of both a point spectrum σp and a (Browder) essential spectrum
σess = {−1}, see also [29]. The point spectrum consists of all
complex numbers which solve (21),
σp := {λ ∈C | ∃n ≥0 : En(λ) = 0}.
(22)
We call µ ̸∈σ a regular value.
3.2. Resolvent
Recall that the point spectrum corresponds to values of λ for
which the operator ∆(λ) is not invertible. For all regular values the
following theorem holds.
Theorem 3 (Resolvent). For given y ∈V and µ ̸∈σ , there exists a
unique q ∈V which solves
∆(µ)q = y.
If both q and y are expanded in spherical harmonics, see Theorem 1,
then coefficients qm
n are given by
qm
n =
ym
n
µ + 1 −κGn(µ).
Proof. Existence and uniqueness of the solution are shown in
[29, Prop. 14]. To identify the solution, we start with ∆(µ)q = y,
substitute (20) and expand G using Theorem 2

Fig. 1. Stability and bifurcations of the homogeneous steady state in the absence of the offset delay τ0. Parametric curves in the (κJ1, κJ2)-plane mark the boundary of the
stability region, which is coloured grey. Solid (dashed) coloured lines represent parameters at which the steady state undergoes a Hopf (fold/transcritical) bifurcation with
respect to the spherical harmonics of degree n. Grey parallel lines in the background mark lines along which κ is constant. In particular, the line passing through the origin
is dashed, which corresponds with a balanced kernel for which explicit calculations can be made. Parameters: τ0 = 0, c = 0.8, σ1 = 1/3, σ2 = 1/4. (For interpretation of
the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Since µ ̸∈σ, the first factor is non-zero and, hence, we obtain the
final identity via division.
□
Although we will not use the resolvent in the remainder of this
section, it will play a prominent role in the evaluation of the normal
form coefficients in Section 5 and Appendix C.
3.3. Stability region
The homogeneous steady state ˆu is stable if Re λ < 0 for all
λ ∈σ. If real eigenvalues vanish, due to a parameter variation, a
fold or transcritical bifurcation will occur. If, instead, eigenvalues
have a vanishing real part but a nonzero complex part, then a
Hopf bifurcation is expected. In the former case one would expect
the formation of time-independent patterns, and in the latter
the emergence of travelling or standing waves. Note that in the
absence of delays (τ
=
0), all eigenvalues are real and given
explicitly by λn = −1 + κwn. In this case Hopf bifurcations are
not possible. The focus of the remainder of this paper will be on
the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns as expected from the
general theory of Hopf bifurcations with symmetry [44,45].
For the chosen connectivity and delay functions (16) and (17)
we are able to find explicit expressions for the coefficients Gn(λ),
of the form
Gn(λ) = J1hn(λ; σ1) + J2hn(λ; σ2),
with hn(λ; σ) according to Appendix B. Using (21), one can identify
the parameters (J1, J2) at which the homogeneous steady state
undergoes a fold or transcritical bifurcation—in this case λ = 0.
Indeed,
1 = κJ1hn(0; σ1) + κJ2hn(0; σ2),
(23)
defines a line in the (κJ1, κJ2)-plane which corresponds to can-
didate fold/transcritical bifurcations corresponding to the mode
number n. In Fig. 1, these lines are plotted with different colours
according to their mode number. Similarly, we trace out the can-
didate Hopf bifurcations by solving (21) for λ = iω,
κJ1hn(iω; σ1) + κJ2hn(iω; σ2) = 1 + iω,
whose solutions are expressed parametrically in terms of ω by
equating real and imaginary parts:

κJ1
κJ2

(ω) =

Re[hn(iω; σ1)]
Re[hn(iω; σ2)]
Im[hn(iω; σ1)]
Im[hn(iω; σ2)]
−1 
1
ω

.
(24)
These parametric curves are plotted for increasing n in Fig. 1 as
solid lines.
Furthermore, for small κJ1 and κJ2, the linear equation (19) is
dominated by the term −v(t, r) such that solutions near the origin
of the (κJ1, κJ2)-plane are asymptotically stable. Since instabilities
only occur at the curves (23) and (24), the stability region can be
extended from the origin to the first bifurcation. This region is
coloured grey in Fig. 1.
Recall that the fixed points of the system (18) depend on w0 =
J1h0(0; σ1) + J2h0(0; σ2) and, hence, κ has an implicit dependency
on J1 and J2 as well. As such, the coordinates shown in Fig. 1 are
conditional on solutions of the transcendental equation (18). For
parameter variations, however, along a line in the set {J1h0(0; σ1)+
J2h0(0; σ2) = C, C ∈R}, the fixed point structure – and therefore
κ – remains unaltered. This collection of parallel lines is illustrated
in Fig. 1 for various C. One line is of particular importance: the
line w0 = 0 corresponds to a balanced kernel, such that ˆu = 0
is the only (homogeneous) fixed point in the system and κ can be
determined explicitly.
3.4. Remarks
From Fig. 1 we conclude that predominantly spatially homoge-
neous instabilities are expected to occur, since the stability region
is largely bounded by fold/transcritical and Hopf bifurcations cor-
responding to n = 0. Only a small part of the stability region, as
shown in the inset, is bounded by curves relating to bifurcations of
higher degree in n.
Fig. 2 depicts a similar diagram to Fig. 1 for different parameters
values. In particular, the offset delay is non-zero. First of all, it is
noted that this increment results in a shift of the stability region:
the stability region is now positioned more symmetrically around
the origin. Furthermore, the Hopf bifurcation curves have a richer
structure than in the case where τ0 = 0, giving rise to many

intersections (corresponding to double Hopf bifurcations). As a
consequence, the stability region is bounded by curves relating to
Hopf bifurcations of spherical harmonics of degrees n ≤5. The
close-up shows the part of the stability region which is bounded
by the Hopf curve for degree n = 4.
For parameters indicated with the marker in the inset of Fig. 2,
we compute the spectrum to verify the foregoing analysis. The
result is depicted in Fig. 3 where we show eigenvalues λ = ρ +
iω in the (ρ, ω) plane for n
≤
5, as determined by solving
(20) numerically. A pair of complex eigenvalues, corresponding to
n = 4 can be seen in the positive half-plane, which matches with
leaving the stability region by crossing the Hopf curve of the same
degree (magenta in Fig. 2).
In Fig. 4 we show a direct simulation of an instability to a pattern
state with n = 4 and ω ̸= 0, highlighting the emergence of a
standing wave. Predictions of the bifurcation point as predicted by
the linear stability analysis are found to be in excellent agreement
with the results from direct numerical simulations in all cases.
These were performed using a bespoke numerical scheme, which
combines standard techniques for tessellating the sphere with
a new approach for solving integro-differential equations with
delays on large meshes [31].
4. Intermezzo: planforms
Near a Hopf bifurcation, as identified by the foregoing analysis,
the solutions destabilise tangent to the critical eigenspace. There-
fore, we expect a dynamical pattern of the form
unc(t, r) =
nc

m=−nc
zm(t)Y m
nc(r) + cc,
where cc stands for complex conjugate, with nc and ωc determined
from the spectral equation (21) such that Enc(iωc) = 0 while
Re λ < 0 for all other λ ∈σ. Sufficiently close to the bifurca-
tion point we expect certain classes of solutions to emerge that
break the O(3) symmetry of the homogeneous steady state. The
tools of equivariant bifurcation theory help to identify solution
candidates based on symmetry arguments alone [44, Chapter XVIII
Section 5], [46]. Typically this is done by developing a system of
ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the amplitudes
z = (z−nc, . . . , znc) ∈C2nc+1. If we denote the space spanned
by the spherical harmonics of degree n by Vn then the action of
O(3)×S1 on unc ∈Vnc ⊕Vnc is determined by its action on z and we
will consider ˙z = f(z), where f is a smooth function that commutes
with the action of O(3)× S1 on Vnc ⊕Vnc . By this we mean that f(z)
is equivariant with respect to the action of O(3) × S1 on Vnc ⊕Vnc :
γ · f(z) = f(γ · z)
for all γ ∈O(3) × S1.
(25)
In order to determine the structure of the equivariant normal
form on Vnc ⊕Vnc to a given order we use the action of elements of
O(3)×S1 on the spherical harmonics of order nc and the raising and
lowering operators [47]. Recall that O(3) = SO(3) ⊕Zc
2 and note
that the inversion element −I ∈Zc
2 acts on spherical harmonics of
degree n as multiplication by (−1)n (for the natural action, which is
the action which we shall be considering throughout). The group
O(3) contains a maximal torus SO(2) corresponding to rotations
in the φ direction (z-axis) through an arbitrary angle φ which act

operators act on the amplitudes zm as [47]
J±zm =

(nc ∓m)(nc ± m + 1)zm±1.
Symmetry can also be used to determine branches of periodic
solutions of ˙z = f(z). Let, without loss of generality, z(t) be a
periodic solution of ˙z = f(z) with period 2π. Then (γ , ψ) ∈
O(3) × S1 is a spatiotemporal symmetry of z(t) if
(γ , ψ) · z(t) ≡γ · z(t + ψ) = z(t)
for all t.
(26)
The set of all spatiotemporal symmetries of a solution z(t) is a
subgroup of O(3) × S1 called the isotropy subgroup of z(t) and
denoted Σz(t). An isotropy subgroup Σ is C-axial if dim Fix(Σ) = 2
(i.e. the subspace of Vnc ⊕Vnc which is invariant under the action
of Σ is two dimensional). The equivariant Hopf theorem (see [44])
states that ˙z = f(z) is guaranteed to have a branch of periodic
solutions with symmetry (isotropy) Σ ⊂O(3) × S1 bifurcating
from the point of dynamic instability if Σ is a C-axial isotropy
subgroup of O(3)× S1 for the action of O(3)× S1 on Vnc ⊕Vnc . This
theorem also requires that the eigenvalues cross the imaginary
axis with non-zero speed. Thus the symmetries of the branches of
periodic solutions bifurcating at a dynamic instability where the
modes of degree nc become unstable correspond to the subgroups
Σ ⊂O(3) × S1 which are C-axial under the action of O(3) × S1
on Vnc ⊕Vnc . Which subgroups are C-axial isotropy subgroups
depends on the value of nc and have been determined for all values
of nc [44,45]. The isotropy subgroups of O(3) × S1 are twisted
subgroups
Hθ = {(h, θ(h)) ∈O(3) × S1 : h ∈H},
(27)
where H is a subgroup of O(3) and θ
:
H →
S1 is a group
homomorphism. Elements of O(3) can be thought of as spatial
symmetries whilst elements of S1 are temporal symmetries acting
on periodic solutions by a phase shift. An element (h, θ(h)) ∈
O(3) × S1 is a spatial symmetry if θ(h) = 0 and a spatiotemporal
symmetry if θ(h) ̸= 0. The spatial symmetries form a normal
subgroup K
=
ker(θ) of H and the quotient group H/K is
isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S1 (i.e. 1, Zn (n ≥2) or S1). The
C-axial isotropy for values of nc between 1 and 6 is given in Table 1
which is reproduced from [45]. All notations for the subgroups of
O(3) here and throughout are consistent with that in [44,45].
Observe for example that if the spherical harmonics of degree
nc = 4 become unstable at the dynamic instability, then branches
of periodic solutions with at least ten distinct symmetry types
bifurcate. These solutions are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in
Fig. 5. There are six standing wave solutions (where the image
of subgroup H
⊂
O(3) under the homomorphism θ is 1 or
Zn (n
≥
2)) and four travelling wave solutions (which have
θ(H) = S1 since the spatial symmetry of a travelling wave does
not change over time). Note from Table 2 that the travelling wave
solutions consist of a single spherical harmonic rotating in one
direction whereas standing wave solutions result from the sum of
spherical harmonics Y m
nc and Y −m
nc . The resulting standing wave can
be thought of as arising due to interference between the waves
travelling in opposite directions around the sphere.
5. Intermezzo: centre manifold reduction
In order to determine which patterns are stable near the bifur-
cation, we apply the method developed in [29], which provides
a generic method for normal form computation in delayed neu-
ral fields. The functional analytic setting of this work is based on
sun–star calculus, which is described in [48] for traditional delay
differential equations. Since the forementioned works are particu-
larly technical, we aim to offer the reader a rudimentary overview
of the sun–star framework leaving out many details; these can be
found in the original works. In particular, we will introduce and
discuss all components of Eqs. (35a) + (35b), which are required
to compute the critical normal form coefficients of bifurcations.
5.1. Sun-star calculus
The space X is the state space of the delayed equation (1) and
elements xt ∈X relate to the system’s history via xt(θ) := x(t +
θ) ∀t ≥0, θ ∈[−h, 0]. Next, consider the linear system

˙x(t) = Lxt
t ≥0,
x(t) = η(t)
t ∈[−h, 0],
(28)
with initial condition η ∈X and linear operator L : X →V. For our
particular system, L is given by1
(Lη)(r) = −η(0, r) + κ

Ω
w(r · r′)η(−τ(r · r′), r′)dr′
∀η ∈X, ∀r ∈Ω.
(29)
Note that, in general, the evolution of the state xt ∈X of a time-
delayed system involves two actions. The first equation of (28) is
a rule for the extension to the future. Secondly, the present state
shifts through the history as time progresses:
xt+1t(θ) = xt(θ + 1t)
θ ∈[−h, 0],
1t ≥0 : −h ≤θ + 1t ≤0.
1 For ease of notation, we will sometimes use η(t)(r) instead of η(t, r).

Formally, consider the strongly continuous semigroup T(·),
which solves (28), that is xt = T(t)η, ∀t ≥0. Associated with T
is the abstract differential equation
d
dt (T(t)η) = A(T(t)η),
where A : D(A) ⊂X →X is the generator defined as
Aη = lim
t↓0
1
t (T(t)η −η),
and corresponding domain D(A) such that this limit exists. Hence,
Aη = ˙η
and
D(A) = {η ∈X : ˙η ∈X and ˙η(0) = Lη}.
(30)
With the generator in this form, we can indeed see that the solu-
tion is generated by shifting and extending. Namely, the action of
A is differentiation, which is the generator of the shift semigroup
T0. The extension component, on the other hand, is incorporated in
the domain of A, suggesting that the solution of (28) is generated
by shifting only those functions that satisfy the differential equa-
tion. Here, we stress the fact that the appearance of the differen-
tial equation as a condition on the domain is cumbersome. If we,
at this point, were to proceed with a linear parameter-dependent
perturbation of the differential equation, the domains of definition
of the solution spaces would change, obstructing standard bifurca-
tion analysis.
This particular problem is overcome if we study the problem
in a new and ‘larger’ space X⊙∗. The space X⊙∗(pronounced:
sun–star) is best thought of as the double dual space of X
with additional canonical restrictions geared towards maintaining
strong continuity of the semigroup. In our case X⊙∗= V ∗∗×
[L1([0, h]; V ∗)]∗, which cannot be represented in terms of known
functions or measures. Yet, X is canonically embedded in X⊙∗via

j : X →X⊙∗given by jη = (η(0), η)—here we exploited the fact
that V × L∞([−h, 0]; V) ⊂X⊙∗, which suffices for our purpose.
The flow on X⊙∗is generated by A⊙∗. If η ∈C1([−h, 0]; V) ⊂X,
then jη ∈D(A⊙∗) and A⊙∗jη = (Lη, ˙η). Comparing A⊙∗with A
as in (30), we see that the condition on the domain, which deals
with the right hand side of the differential equation, is transformed
into an action of the operator (i.e. the first component of A⊙∗jη). In
this setting, we can readily perturb the linear system (28) without
altering the space X⊙∗or the domain of A⊙∗.
5.2. Centre manifold and homological equation
We proceed to the non-linear model which generalises the
neural field (1) + (2a):

˙x(t) = F(xt)
t ≥0,
x(t) = η(t)
t ∈[−h, 0],
(31)
for some Lipschitz continuous F : X →V. Note that the differential
equation is an equation in V ⊂V ∗∗and, upon assuming xt ∈
C1([−h, 0]; V), ∀t ≥0, we can extend (31) to an equation in X⊙∗

The last equation defines an abstract differential equation on X⊙∗,
where R : X →X⊙∗is a true non-linearity in its first component.
Whenever the system (31) is at a critical point, i.e. L has N
eigenvalues with vanishing real part, then there exists a locally
invariant centre manifold W c, which is tangent to the critical
eigenspace at the origin. Moreover, if there are also N critical
eigenfunctions ξi, then there exists a smooth H : W ⊂RN →X
such that H(W) = W c. We expand H

where ν is a multi-index of length N and hν ∈X. (Note that, in
the case of complex eigenvalues, the expansion is usually chosen
differently; see Appendix C.) On the centre manifold, the system
satisfies some ODE in RN that is equivalent to the normal form
˙z(t) =

1≤|ν|≤3
gνzν + O(|z(t)|4),
(33)
with unknown critical normal form coefficients gν ∈RN. Due to
invariance of the centre manifold, we can restrict the dynamics to
the centre manifold, i.e. xt = H(z(t)), and substitute (32) to obtain
the homological equation
jDH(z)˙z = A⊙∗jH(z) + R(H(z)).
(34)
Next, R admits the expansion
R(η) =
1
2!
B(η, η) +

3!
C(η, η, η) + O(∥η∥4),
where B and C are the bi- and tri-linear operators corresponding re-
spectively to the second and third derivatives of F, cf. Appendix C.1.
Note that, since R is zero in its second component, also B and C will
be zero in their second components.
Finally, (34) allows us to find expressions for the critical normal
coefficients. Equating coefficients of powers of z on both sides,
one recursively obtains expressions for hν and gν. In particular,
one encounters linear systems of two forms which can be solved
explicitly:
• For µ a regular value (i.e. µ ̸∈σ(A)), η ∈X and v ∈V
(µ −A⊙∗)jη = (v, 0) =⇒η(t) = eµt∆−1(µ)v
(35a)
with ∆−1(µ) the resolvent as in Theorem 3.

We note that the two foregoing statements are not explicitly stated
in the original works [29,30], but are discussed and implemented
in §4.4 and §4.3 respectively.
6. Bifurcations and normal form computation
In this section we combine the various results from the
foregoing sections to identify and classify several bifurcations in
the model (1) + (2a). Using the stability results from Section 3,
we identify the precise parameter values of the bifurcation points.
Since we know the mode number(s) involved in the bifurcation, the
planforms in Section 4 inform us about the relevant symmetries
and the corresponding normal form equation. This normal form is,
in turn, at the heart of the centre manifold reduction reviewed in
Section 5, which enables us to computate the relevant coefficients
in the normal form. All that remains at this point, is to analyse
the behaviour of the normal form’s low-dimensional dynamics.
While these have been studied and documented in great detail for
bifurcations of codimension 1 and 2 in systems without symmetry,
e.g. [49], the normal forms of symmetric bifurcations are numerous
and, therefore, lacking a clear overview. As a consequence, we will
devote part of this section to the analysis of the low-dimensional
system that arises from a double Hopf bifurcation with a special
symmetry.
More concretely, we study the following two bifurcations:
• Hopf bifurcation where E0(iω0) = 0, and
• double Hopf bifurcation for mixed interactions, where E0(iω0) =
0 and E1(iω1) = 0.
A third case, the Hopf bifurcation due to E1 only, is treated in
Appendix C.3.
6.1. Hopf bifurcation, E0
As a starting point we will analyse the simplest Hopf bifurcation
in the system, namely the one without symmetry. The reasons for
this are twofold: Firstly, Fig. 1 reveals that for τ0 = 0 the stability
region is largely bounded by the Hopf bifurcation corresponding to
n = 0. Secondly, the centre manifold is more accessible because
we can apply the results for the generic Hopf bifurcation given
in [29]. We are, however, in a better position than the authors of
the original work: since our model allows its eigenfunctions to be
expressed analytically, we are able to find a closed expression of
the first Lyapunov coefficient l1.
If for ω0 >
0, iω0 is a simple root of E0 and En(iω) ̸=
0
for all other n and ω ≥0, then the system undergoes a Hopf
bifurcation w.r.t. the mode n = 0. In this case, the eigenvalue
λ = iω0 has both algebraic and geometric multiplicity equal to
1, and its eigenfunction is ξ(t, r) = eiω0tY 0
0 (r) = eiω0t/
√
4π.
Since the eigenfunction is constant across space, the oscillations
originating from this bifurcation will also be homogeneous across
space. Therefore, we denote this pattern as a bulk oscillation.
Because the eigenvalue has multiplicity one, the normal form
for this Hopf bifurcation is given by:
˙z = (ρ0 + iω0)z + g21z2z,
(36)
with g21 the coefficient determining the criticality. Here ρ0 denotes
the real part of the critical eigenvalue in the neighbourhood (in
parameter space) of the bifurcation; clearly ρ0
=
0 at the
bifurcation. Moreover, the first Lyapunov coefficient is defined as
l1
:=
1
ω0 Re g21. Using the techniques described in Section 5,
we are able to find an explicit expression for this coefficient (cf.
Appendix C.2):
g21 =
1 + iω0
8πκ(1 −κG′
0(iω))

f ′′′(ˆu) + f ′′(ˆu)2
× [Q0(2iω0) + 2Q0(0)]) ,
(37)
where
Qn(µ) :=
Gn(µ)
µ + 1 −κGn(µ).
(38)
Now, a negative (positive) sign of the first Lyapunov coefficient
corresponds with a supercritical (subcritical) bifurcation.
Using the parametric expression for the Hopf bifurcations in
parameter space, as formulated in Section 3, and the choice
of f as in (15), we are able to determine the first Lyapunov
coefficient along these curves. In particular, we identify parameters
for which the first Lyapunov coefficient vanishes, corresponding
to a generalised Hopf bifurcation. Although we do not compute
the second Lyapunov coefficient, we investigate this bifurcation
numerically; see Fig. 6. The bistability, as observed in Fig. 6
(B3), between a focus (red) and a limit cycle (blue) suggests that
the second Lyapunov coefficient is negative. Note that, since the
pattern is homogeneous across space, it suffices to plot time series
at only one point on the sphere.
6.2. Double Hopf bifurcation, E0 and E1
If we, starting at the supercritical Hopf bifurcation for n = 0,
vary a different parameter, we will not observe a change of sign of
the first Lyapunov exponent. Instead, we find that another pair of
eigenvalues, corresponding to n = 1, passes through the imaginary
axis. We analyse this double Hopf bifurcation using symmetry
techniques.
For n = 0, 1, let ωn > 0 be such that iωn is a simple root
of En and, moreover, En(iω) has no other roots for ω ≥0 and
n ≥0. There is one eigenfunction ψ(t, r) = eiω0tY 0
0 (r) related to
iω0, while there are three corresponding to iω1, namely ξm(t, r) =
eiω1tY m
1 (r) for m = −1, 0, 1.
In the non-resonant case, i.e. kω0 ̸= lω1 for all k, l ∈N with
k + l ≤5, symmetry arguments yield the truncated normal form
up to cubic order:
˙w = (ρ0 + iω0)w + a1w|w|2 + a2w|z|2,
(39a)
˙zm = (ρ1 + iω1)zm + b1zm|z|2
+ b2ˆzm(z2
0 −2z−1z1) + b3zm|w|2,
m = 0, ±1,

where

ˆz := (−z1, z0, −z−1),
|z|2 :=

(40)
Expressions for the critical coefficients, a1, a2, b1, b2, b3 of the
model (2b) are given in Appendix C.4. Moreover, setting z =

Fig. 6. Generalised Hopf bifurcation occurs for δ ≈0.4172 and α = 1. (A1) shows that for δ = 0.40 the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical. Time series for two different initial
conditions (red and blue) reveal one stable focus for α = 0.98 (B1) while for α = 1.02 a stable limit cycle is observed (B2). For δ = 0.48, the criticality of the Hopf bifurcation
has changed, resulting in a multistable regime (A2). Indeed, in (B3) simulations show that for α = 0.98 there exist two stable solutions: a stable focus (red) and a stable
limit cycle (blue). For α = 1.02, the stable focus has destabilised and only the stable limit cycle remains. Parameter values: β = 4, τ0 = 3, c = 1, σ1 = 1 and σ2 = 1/2,
κJ1 ≈1.565, κJ2 ≈−4.075 and ω0 ≈0.950. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

It is important to stress the fact that, since we are neglecting
terms of order 4 and higher, we can only study the ‘simple’ case
[49, Section 8.6.2]. Therefore, our analysis is only valid whenever
Re a1 Re b1 > 0.
We continue to identify possible solutions of (39). By computing
all isotropy subgroups of O(3) × S1 for the representation on
(V0 ⊕V0) ⊕(V1 ⊕V1) we find that there are three C-axial
subgroups which are numbered 1–3 in Table 3. This table gives
all isotropy subgroups, Σ, for this representation, along with a
representative fixed point subspace, Fix(Σ), for one particular
choice of set of generators of the subgroup. Branches of solutions
with these symmetry types are guaranteed to exist by the
equivariant Hopf theorem. The patterns corresponding to solution
types 1–3 are respectively bulk oscillations, travelling waves and
standing waves.
Other solutions to (39) may exist depending on the values of
parameters. These correspond to isotropy types which have fixed
point subspaces of dimension greater than 2 and are types 4–8 in
Table 3. We make the following observations about the solutions
with such symmetries. We have two types of solutions with only
n = 1 modes (using the numbering in Table 3):
4. This solution has contributions from two different n = 1 modes.
If a solution with this symmetry were to exist generically
(i.e. when Re b2 ̸=
0) it would have z−1 =
R(t)eiφ(t) and
z1 = R(t)ei(φ(t)+ψ) for some fixed phase shift ψ.
5. This solution has contributions from two different n = 1 modes.
Thus w = 0, z = (R−1(t)eiφ−1(t), R0(t)eiφ0(t), R1(t)eiφ1(t)). In
this case the equations for the amplitudes Rm(t) and phases
φm(t), m = −1, 0, 1 do not decouple. However the equations
have effective dimension 4 since they only depend on the com-
bination of phases 2φ0 −φ1 −φ−1.
There could also exist three types of mixed mode solutions.
These can only have spatial symmetries since we assume no res-
onance between the n = 0 and n = 1 modes.
6. Removing the time shift symmetries of the standing wave solu-
tion with 
O(2) symmetry, we are left only with the O(2)−sym-
metry which allows for a nonzero amplitude of the n = 0 mode.
7. Solutions with just a reflection symmetry include (for the case
of reflection in the xy plane) w = r(t)eiθ(t), z = (R−1(t)eiφ−1(t),
0, R1(t)eiφ1(t)). In this case the equations for the amplitudes
again decouple but a solution with R−1 ̸= 0, R1 ̸= 0 and
r ̸= 0 only exists generically in the case that R−1 = R1 and
φ−1 = φ1 + ψ for a constant phase shift ψ.
8. For solutions with no symmetry we have
w = r(t)eiθ(t),
z = (R−1(t)eiφ−1(t), R0(t)eiφ0(t), R1(t)eiφ1(t)).
Here the amplitude and phase equations are coupled but as for
solution type 5 they depend only on θ and 2φ0 −φ1 −φ−1 so
the effective dimension is 6 rather than 8.
Although it is not possible to decouple the system in its
original form, a different set of coordinates does. Indeed, the
transformation(x1, x2, x3) = (|w|2, |z2
0−2z−1z1|, |z|2) ∈R3 yields
a decoupled system of ODEs:
˙x1 = 2x1(ρ0 + ˜a1x1 + ˜a2x3)
(42a)
˙x2 = 2x2(ρ1 + (˜b1 + ˜b2)x3 + ˜b3x1)
(42b)
˙x3 = 2x3(ρ1 + ˜b1x3 + ˜b3x1) + 2˜b2x2

Fig. 7. Nullplanes of (42) in the x2 = 0 plane, depicting x1, x2 and x3 in red, green
and blue respectively. Note that the plane x2 = 0 is a x2-nullplane, such that shown
intersections of x1- and x3-nullplanes correspond with steady states; i.e. points i–iv.
For x2 > 0, the x2-nullplane is given by the dashed green line, yielding two more
equilibria in the unseen dimension: v and vi, for which x2 = x3. Parameters as
follows: µ1, µ2 > 0 and ˜ai, ˜bj < 0 for all i, j. (For interpretation of the references to
colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
where ˜ai and ˜bi denote the real parts of ai and bi respectively.
Fixed points of the system x can be related to all of the eight cases
described above; Table 3 shows this relation.
It is straightforward to show that, generically, the system (42)
has at most 6 equilibria in the first octant x1, x2, x3 ≥0. (Note
that solutions outside the first octant are irrelevant, for xi are non-
negative amplitudes.) For parameters corresponding with the dou-
ble Hopf bifurcation in the full non-linear model (2a), we find that
the real parts of all normal form coefficients in (39) are nega-
tive. The phase plane of the corresponding reduced system (42) is
shown in Fig. 7, which reveals the occurrence of all 6 steady states.
Continuing with a linear stability analysis of these six equilibria,
we find that only points ii and iii are asymptotically stable (i.e. x =
(−µ1/a1, 0, 0) and x = (0, 0, −µ2/b1) respectively). Therefore,
we conclude from Table 3 the existence of a multistable regime in
which we observe either bulk oscillations, travelling waves, or a
mixture of different 1-modes (cases 1, 2 and 5 respectively).
This result is confirmed using direct simulations of the model
near the bifurcation. We find two stable solutions, namely bulk
oscillations (case 1) and rotating waves (case 2); the latter is
depicted in Fig. 8. We have not identified a stable solution
consisting of mixed 1-modes (case 5).
7. Discussion
In this paper we have analysed pattern formation in a spherical
model of brain activity and shown how a rich repertoire of spatio-
temporal states can be supported in neural models of Nunez
type that contain only simple representations for anatomical
connectivity, axonal delays and population firing rates. Even
though these models are naturally formulated as nonlinear
evolution equations of integro-differential form with delays, which
have been little studied, they are amenable to similar analyses
used for studying pattern-formation in PDEs. Perhaps surprisingly
this is the first time that a combination of linear stability analysis,
symmetric bifurcation theory, centre manifold reduction and
direct numerical simulations have been combined to explore such
a popular model for EEG generation. Most certainly this is because
it has proved easier to study versions of the model on the line [50]
or the plane [51], despite the obvious motivation to study the
model on more brain like topologies.
Importantly, our study is the first one to carry out a detailed
centre manifold reduction on the full integral formulation of
the model, including transmission delays, in a two-dimensional
setting—the one-dimensional case is discussed in [28–30]. As a
result, this new work has shed light on the importance of delays
in generating patterns with a high degree of spatial structure,
as well as developed the bifurcation theory that can be used
to ascertain the emergence of a given symmetric structure via
the destabilisation of a homogeneous steady state. Our approach
has also allowed us to explicitly pin-point the conditions for
codimension-2 bifurcations, where two or more distinct patterns
can be excited and then subsequently interact.
Secondary bifurcations, especially those related to multi-
stability, have received considerable attention in the modelling of
EEG; especially in the context of epileptic seizures. The generalised
Hopf bifurcation, with bistability between rest and oscillation,
has a pivotal position in explaining ictal transitions in models of
cortical columns [52,53]. Since these models have been studied
primarily in the absence of a spatial component, it has remained
unclear what the impact of both spatial structure and transmission
delays would be on oscillations and synchrony in the model. In this
article we have shown that the generalised Hopf bifurcation can
still occur in the extended setting, enabling the model to switch
between rest and a fully synchronous periodic solution. The double
Hopf bifurcation, which yields a type of multistability where
multiple stable periodic solutions can exist, was studied in a neural
field context as early as 1980 [54]. Therein, the authors emphasised
that the appearance of quasi-periodic behaviour, which occurs in
a special case of the bifurcation as a result of mixing between
two stable oscillations, could explain the transition between the
tonic and clonic seizure states. Being largely theoretical, their work
does not provide a methodology for computing or classifying these
transitions. Although we have been able to identify these quasi-
periodic oscillations in our work (points IV and VI in Fig. 7), we have

of the sphere’s centre of mass is shown in B, projected in the x, y-plane. The initial condition, marked with the red cross, is near the (asymptotically) unstable standing wave
pattern, causing the system to remain close to this pattern—as is shown by the centre of mass moving oscillating in an almost straight line. In the course of the simulation,
the centre of mass approaches its limit cycle (red circle), which corresponds to the rotating wave solution. This stable solution co-exists with stable bulk oscillations (not
shown). Parameter values: α = 1.08, β = 4, δ = 0.1, τ0 ≈3.483, c = 1, σ1 = 1 and σ2 = 1/2, J1 ≈1.678, J2 ≈−4.367, ω0 ≈0.861 and ω1 ≈0.609. Simulated with a
mesh of 5120 triangles. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

remains an open question whether such parameters exist for our
model. Other work on secondary bifurcations in one-dimensional
neural field models can be found in [55].
Of course, the Nunez model is also able to generate a whole
host of more exotic behaviour in regimes where our analytical
approaches have less sway. For example, Fig. 8 shows the
emergence of a large scale rotating wave which is reminiscent
of those reported in EEG studies of schizophrenic patients [56].
In these instances the development of our bespoke numerical
scheme pays further dividends since it is not restricted to
perfectly spherical models. The scheme is sufficiently general to
handle real folded cortical structures with more detailed white
matter fibre tractography data, of the type that is increasingly
available in public repositories such as the Human Connectome
Project [57]. Indeed one natural extension of the work presented
in this paper is the development of a primarily computational
model of brain activity that can incorporate more biological
detail, such as folded cortical hemispheres [58], heterogeneous
connection topologies [59] and a distribution of axonal speeds [60].
Such a model is relevant to interpreting modern whole brain
neuroimaging signals, and its exploration would set the scene
for formulating the relevant mathematical questions about how
best to understand the behaviour of a complex brain model. For
example, it would be interesting to explore how wave dispersion
and interaction on a folded cortex affects the frequency of
emergent rhythms and the dependence of these on underlying
activity that is primarily either in the form of travelling waves or
standing waves. Even before developing such a programme the
model explored here has other solutions that are of interest to
the neuroscience community in the form of localised states (such
as spots), often invoked in the context of working memory and
easily established for a steep sigmoidal firing rate and Mexican-
hat connectivity, see for example [61]. Once again progress in this
arena might take as a starting point ideas recently developed for
the study of spots for PDEs on a sphere [62]. These and other topics,
including the response of the model to forcing, will be reported
upon elsewhere.

For the evaluation of the integrals, we apply the following result.
Theorem 4. For a ∈C and Pn the Legendre polynomial of degree

exp(a cos−1 s)Pn(s)ds
satisfies the recurrence relation:
In(a)In+1(a) =

(a2 + n2)(a2 + (n + 1)2)(a2 + (n + 2)2),
I0(a) =
1 + eaπ
a2 + 1 .
(B.1)
This yields, moreover, the two-term recurrence relation:
In+2(a) = In(a)
a2 + n2
a2 + (n + 3)2 .
Proof. First, consider for n ≥0
Hn(a) :=
π

(B.2)
We will use mathematical induction to show that Hn satisfies the
following recurrence relation
Hn+1(a)Hn(a) =
1 −e2aπ
an + (n + 1)2 ,
H0(a) =
eaπ −1

(B.3)
Starting with a recurrence relation for Legendre polynomials, we
find
(n + 1)Pn+1(cos t) + nPn−1(cos t) = (2n + 1) cos t Pn(cos t),
(n + 1)Hn+1(a) + nHn−1(a) =

(B.4)
where we have expressed cos t as a complex exponential. Another

where the left hand side is obtained via integration by parts and
the right hand side via expressing sin t as a complex exponential.
Adding (B.4) and i times (B.5) yields
(n + 1 + ia)Hn+1(a) + (n −ia)Hn−1(a) =
2n + 1
2
Hn(a + i). (B.6)
This identity will be the starting point for the mathematical
induction.
Assume that (B.3) holds for all n ≤N for some N > 0; we will
prove that it also holds for n = N + 1. Combining (B.3) at n = N
and at n = N −1, yields
HN−1(a) = HN+1(a)
a2 + (N + 1)2
a2 + N2
,
(B.7)
which simplifies (B.6):
HN+1(a) =
a −iN
a −i(N + 1)
HN(a + i).
(B.8)
Multiply (B.8) with itself at N and N + 1 to obtain
HN+2(a)HN+1(a) =
(a −i(N + 1))(a −iN)
(a −i(N + 2))(a −i(N + 1))
× HN+1(a + i)HN(a + i),
and apply (B.3) on the right hand side to find
HN+2(a)HN+1(a) =
1 −e2aπ
a2 + (N + 2)2 ,
which proves the recurrence relation for Hn(a).
Return to In(a). Note that for the substitution s = cos t:
In(a) =
π
0
eat sin(t) Pn(cos t) dt =
1
2i(Hn(a + i) −Hn(a −i)).
Substitute this and (B.7) in (B.4) to obtain
In(a) = −

a2 + n2 Hn+1(a).
(B.9)
Multiply the equation with itself at n and n + 1
In+1(a)In(a) =
a2
(a2 + n2)(a2 + (n + 1)2)
Hn+2(a)Hn+1(a),
and apply (B.3) to obtain (B.1).

C.2. Hopf bifurcation, nc = 0
In this case, let λ = ±iω0 be the only purely imaginary eigen-
value of the system, such that
1 + iω0 −κG0(iω) = 0.
This eigenvalue has multiplicity 1 and the corresponding eigen-
function is ξ(t, r) = eiω0tY 0
0 (r) = eiω0t/
√
4π. This case corre-
sponds with the ordinary Hopf bifurcation formulated in [29] and,
hence, we can apply their result directly.
The quadratic terms in the normal form yield equations
(2iω0 −A⊙∗)jh20 = B(ξ, ξ),
(C.3a)
−A⊙∗jh11 = B(ξ, ξ).

From the characteristic equation it follows that iω0 + 1 −

for all n > 0 and these contour integrals vanish. The first equation
is evaluated using Cauchy’s integral formula:

C.3. Hopf bifurcation, nc = 1
For n = 1, there is one pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues
λ = ±iω1 such that
1 + iω1 −κG1(iω1) = 0.
(C.10)
In this case, the eigenvalue has algebraic and geometric multiplic-
ity 3, with corresponding eigenfunctions ξm(t, r) = eiω1tY m
1 (r) for
m = −1, 0, 1. The corresponding Poincaré normal form, to which
the system is smoothly orbitally equivalent, is of the form:
˙zm = iω1zm + g(3,1)zm|z|2 + g(3,2)ˆzm(z2
0 −2z−1z1) + O(|z|4),
m = −1, 0, 1,

z := (z−1, z0, z1),
ˆz := (−z1, z0, −z−1),
|z|2 :=


m=−1
|zm|2.
with g(3,1) and g(3,2) the critical normal form coefficients belonging
to the two equivariants of order 3, see for instance [63]. The critical
centre manifold is now of the form
H(z, z) =

ν! :=

m .
After substituting (C.11) and (C.12) into (34) we obtain one large
equation that we solve by equating powers of z and z on both sides.
At second order, we are able to find an equation for each of the 21
hν ζ , but here we list only those that we will require to determine
the critical coefficients g:
(2iω1 −A⊙∗)jh200 000 = B(ξ−1, ξ−1),
(C.13a)
−A⊙∗jh100 100 = B(ξ−1, ξ−1),
(C.13b)
(2iω1 −A⊙∗)jh020 000 = B(ξ0, ξ0),
(C.13c)
−A⊙∗jh010 001 = B(ξ0, ξ1).
(C.13d)
Note that each of these equations is of the form (C.3) and is solved
in an identical manner: evaluate B, expand in spherical harmonics
and apply the resolvent. In particular, one will encounter integrals
involving the product of three spherical harmonics for which the
following identity is useful:

and similar expressions for the remaining three h’s.
At cubic order, the homological equation yields the following
two equations (out of a total of 56)
(iω1 −A⊙∗)jh200 100 = (v1, 0) + 2g(3,1)jξ−1,
(iω1 −A⊙∗)jh020 001 = (v2, 0) −2g(3,2)jξ−1,
where
(v1, 0) := C(ξ−1, ξ−1, ξ−1) + B(ξ−1, h200 000) + 2B(ξ−1, h100 100),
(v2, 0) := C(ξ0, ξ0, ξ1) + B(ξ1, h020 000) + 2B(ξ0, h010 010).
Note the similarity of these equations with (C.6) and (C.7). Hence,
using the same procedure as before, we find:
g(3,1) =
1 + iω1
20πκ(1 −κG′
1(iω1))

(C.14b)
An important remark is that we could have selected a different set
of equations to determine the coefficients, yet their outcome will
be identical due to the symmetries in the system.

C.4. Double Hopf bifurcation, nc = {0, 1}
At the Hopf–Hopf bifurcation, the system has two pairs of
purely complex eigenvalues, namely λ = ±iω0 (with multiplicity
1) and λ
=
±iω1 (with multiplicity 3). The corresponding
eigenfunctions are ψ(t, r) = eiω0tY 0
0 (r) and ξm(t, r) = eiω1tY m
1 (r)
for m ∈{−1, 0, 1}. In the absence of resonances, the Poincaré
normal form is the following (truncated at cubic order):
˙w = iω0w + g21w|w2| + γ0w|z|2 + O(|z|4),
˙zm = iω1zm + g(3,1)zm|z|2 + g(3,2)ˆzm(z2
0 −2z−1z1)
+ γ1zm|w|2 + O(|z|4),
m = −1, 0, 1,
where z := (w, z−1, z0, z1) and |z| as in the previous section.
Note how the equations for w and zm correspond with the normal
forms in the Hopf bifurcations, (C.11) and (36) respectively, with
the exception of the mixed terms. Hence, the critical normal form
coefficients g21, g(3,1) and g(3,2) are given by (C.9) and (C.14). We
are left to compute the coefficients γ0 and γ1.
Following the same procedure as in Appendix C.3, we construct
the homological equation. At quadratic order, we obtain:
(iω0 + iω1 −A⊙∗)jh1010 0000 = B(ψ, ξ0),
(C.15a)
(iω0 −iω1 −A⊙∗)jh1000 0010 = B(ψ, ξ0),
(C.15b)
−A⊙∗jh0010 0010 = B(ξ0, ξ0),
(C.15c)
(iω0 + iω1 −A⊙∗)jh1100 0000 = B(ψ, ξ−1),
(C.15d)
(iω0 −iω1 −A⊙∗)jh1000 0010 = B(ψ, ξ−1),
(C.15e)
(−iω0 + iω1 −A⊙∗)jh0100 1000 = B(ξ−1, ψ),
(C.15f)
which can all be solved to obtain hν ζ . At cubic order, we have the
following non-singular equations:
(iω0 −A⊙∗)jh1010 0010 = (v0, 0) −γ0jψ,
(C.16a)
(iω1 −A⊙∗)jh1100 1000 = (v1, 0) −γ1jξ−1,
(C.16b)
where
(v0, 0) := C(ψ, ξ0, ξ0) + B(ψ, h0010 0010)
+ B(ξ0, h1000 0010) + B(ξ0, h1010 0000),
(C.17a)
(v1, 0) := C(ψ, ξ−1, ψ) + B(ψ, h0100 1000)
+ B(ξ−1, h1000 0010) + B(ξ−1, h1100 0000).
(C.17b)
From the solvability conditions, we find expressions for the critical
normal form coefficients:
γ0 =
1 + iω0
4πκ(1 −κG′
0(iω0))

f ′′′(ˆu) + f ′′(ˆu)2[Q0(0)
+ Q1(iω0 + iω1) + Q1(iω0 −iω1)]) ,
γ1 =
1 + iω1
4πκ(1 −κG′
1(iω1))

f ′′′(ˆu) + f ′′(ˆu)2[Q0(0)
+ Q1(iω0 + iω1) + Q1(−iω0 + iω1)]) .
