The extrema of the position-dependent spontaneous magnetization in a periodically layered two-
dimensional Ising model are calculated exactly. Their asymptotic behaviour for infinite width of 
the surrounding homogeneous sublayer is given. The perturbations caused by the neighbouring 
sublayers on this extremum in a very thick sublayer are shown to be decoupled. Thus the asympto-
tic decay of the magnetization far from a single layer-shaped inhomogeneity can be inferred from 
the quoted asymptotics of an extremum, and it is found to be 
exp( — d/£i) 
where d is the 
distance to the inhomogeneity and f f the correlation length in the underlying homogeneous lattice. 
The connection of this decay law to the asymptotic decay of correlations is dicussed. 
1. Introduction and Summary 
It is the purpose of this paper to present exact 
calculations1 on the position dependence of the 
spontaneous magnetization of a two-dimensional 
Ising model in which layer-shaped inhomogeneities 
are present. The interest in such layered Ising 
models arises from the fact that the critical behav-
iour of real crystalline magnets is heavily influenced 
by any disturbance of the full translational sym-
metry of the infinite homogenous lattice (e. g. point 
defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, finiteness of 
the sample). In the past, the phase transition in such 
layered lattices has been studied by many authors 2 -'. 
Correlations and spontaneous magnetization were 
already discussed by McCoy and W u 3 and Au-
Yang and McCoy 8, but without explicit calculation 
of the position dependence. 
In this paper a particular case of a quadratic 
5=1/2 layered Ising model with nearest-neighbour 
interactions is considered. The period layer consists 
of two sublayers within which the exchange cou-
plings are chosen to be position-independent (but 
generally direction-dependent, see Figure 2). This 
model contains grain boundaries and interfaces as 
special cases. — In Chapter 2 the "local spontaneous 
magnetization" of a layered lattice is expressed 
through the eigenvectors of the "layer transfer ma-
trix". In Chapter 3 this matrix is diagonalized for 
the special lattice of Figure 2. Chapter 4 gives an 
expression for m(/0), the local magnetization in 
lattice chain l 0, in terms of a block Toeplitz deter-
minant. In Chapter 5 the extrema of m{l0) are ex-

plicitly evaluated as limits of scalar Toeplitz deter-
minants. Chapter 6 contains the calculation of the 
asymptotic behaviour of such an extremum if the 
width of the surrounding sublayer tends to infinity. 
Finally, 
on the basis of this asymptotics, 
the 
asymptotic decay of m(l0) 
far from a single layer-
shaped inhomogeneity is given. Chapter 7 discusses 
the results of this work. 
In the first of the appendices the transcendental 
equation defining the global critical temperature 7\, 
of the layered lattice is discussed. One finds the 
interesting possibility of Tc getting zero if the two 
sublayers favour opposite types of order (ferro-
magnetic resp. antiferromagnetic) and have suitable 
sublayer widths (see Figure 7). 
2. Spontaneous Magnetization of a Layered

of two-dimensional Ising lattices is based on the for-

(2.1.) 
where okf = ± 1 is an Ising spin at the lattice site 
(h, I) of an M x N square lattice, and (}MN denotes 
the average over a canonical ensemble of such lat-
tices. (2.1) has only recently11 been proven to be 
correct for ferromagnetic couplings, but since the 
calculations in the present work can be done for an 
antiferromagnetic lattice as well, we shall use the 
form

for both cases (without proving that it has any 
meaning in the antiferromagnetic case). In a lay-
ered lattice with layers parallel to the k direction 
m will depend on I so we have written m (I) in 
(2.2).

thus commutes with 2!kk' we may use in (2.9) the

fication (3.20/21) used later in this work.] 
In the following we consider a periodically lay-
ered lattice Avith period

(»'integer), 
(2.4) 
that means 
Jkl = Jl = Jl + pn > 
Jkl = Jl = Jl + pn

for all k. For such a lattice it is convenient to intro-
duce the "layer transfer matrix" F„(/0) by 
Z0 + n -1 
vu(i0)=nvl. 
l = K 
(2.12) 
The eigenvalues of F„(/0) are A1,

where r k r is the direct product [(2.18 b) of 1 0] of 
Tx with ( 2 x 2 )

they depend on l0, T, and M. 
3. Diagonalization of the Layer Transfer 
Matrix 
In this and the following chapter we shall take 
over as far as possible the many-fermion technique 
used by Schultz et al. 1 0 (hereafter referred to as 
SML) in the diagonalization of the transfer matrix 
Vj. One should note that our coupling constants 
Kt, K[ correspond to 
, K2 in SML. — For the 
sake of convenience we shall abbreviate the fre-
quently occurring circular and hyperbolic functions 
by special symbols: 
Sx = sin x 
= cos X 
T r = tan x 
= sinh x 
= cosh x 
%x = tanh x 
(The abbreviation Tz should not be confused with 
the "local critical temperatures" TQ\, 
defined 
later.) 
The Pauli matrices used in the representation 
(2.17/18) are transformed to fermion operators by 
the Jordan-Wigner transformation SML (3.2/4) : 
where 
r * * « * [ r k x ± i r k y ) 
(3.2) 
and 
Ni T\ =*2 V 
• 
(3-3) 
; = 1 
In terms of these fermion operators the factors of 
the transfer matrix V/, (2.6/7), are given by SML 
(3.5/9): 
_ M 
VP = (2 ©2 K,)M'2 exp { - K,* 2 (2 C,+ c, - 1)} , 
M 
* = * 
VP = exp {K, [ 2 (c/,+ - cu) (ck+l + ck + 1) 
(3.4) 
The star_in K * denotes the familiar duality trans-
form of Ki (12, cf. Eqs. (14 - 20) of 9 ) : 
%K* = e~2K O &2K* <S2K = 1 0 e-2K* = %K . (3.5) 
In (3.4) we have defined the "c parity" Pc by 
P c = ( - 1 ) ^ 
(3.6) 
with N&t defined analogously to (3.3): 
M 
2 ck
+ ck . 
k = 1 
For all /, Vi commutes with P,. as can be seen 
from (3.4) [cf. SML (3.11)] : 
[ P e , F z ] = 0 . 
(3.7) 
Hence the layer transfer matrix 
Vn(l0) 
(being 
simply a product of different V/s) 
also commutes 
with P„: 
[Pc,Vn(z0)]=o. 
(3.8) 
Thus the eigenvectors of Vn(l0) 
can be classified 
according to their c parity, and we can, in analogy 
to SML, define two different operators Vn
+{10) and 
V,r(l0) 
in the two subspaces with Pc= +1, resp., 
P c = — 1 : 
/„ + n - 1 
Vn±(l0) 
= 
r
w 
(3.9) 
1 = 1, 
with Vr 
given by SML (3.13). Therefore, 
Vn
+(l0) 
and Vn~(l0) 
differ only in the anticyclic, resp., 
cyclic boundary condition 
cm + \ = + C x . 
(3.10) 
Like Vi we have for Vn (Z0) the 
T h e o r e m 3.1: The set of eigenvectors of V„(l0) 
consists of the "c-even" eigenvectors of Vu+ (/0) 
and the "c-odd" ones of 
Vn~(l0). 
Because of the Jki, 
]ki being independent of k 
(layered 
lattice!) we can transform to running-
wave fermion operators rjQ by SML (3.16). Then 
V/j1 (Z0) splits into a direct product of commuting 
factors, each belonging to fixed modulus of the 
wave number q: 
V nHk)=fl{2£»K l)W-\^\V n<i ±{l,) . (3.11) 
Z = 1 
0<?±<JI 
The q+ are two different sets of wave numbers cor-
responding to the two different boundary conditions 
(3.10) and are given by SML (3.17) :

where M is chosen to be even. The factor F„9±(Z0) 
is a product of the corresponding factors Viq± of Vi 
[see SML ( 3 . 1 9 - 2 1 ) , denoted there by VQ]: 
Vnq±(\0) 
= 
I W ± . 
(3.13) 
i = i, 
(In the following the subscript "Hb" of q will be 
suppressed until this distinction becomes essential.) 
Since the Vn
q(l0) 
all commute they can be diago-
nalized separately, and (like V f ) each Vn
q(l0) 
is a 
(4 x 4) matrix in the subspace spanned by

\-qq)v} 
• 
(3.14) 
i 
(Here | - q q)n = rjtq i]q | vac},, = - | q, - q)n, 
and 
similar.) Since the running-wave basis (3.14) is 
the same for all V/ [and for F„(/0) too] the fol-
lowing result of SML on the Vp can be taken over 
to the 
Vn
q(l0): 
Th e o r e m 3.2: Vn

to q)n and j — q)n with eigenvalues

Here Mt = M/(Kh K*) 
is defined through the iden-
tification of exp(2C qK;)MI with the corresponding 
(2 x 2) matrix of Vp in the concerned subspace, 
see SML (3.27). Thus we are left with the diago-
nalization of the (2 x 2) matrix product 
M(l 0) 
= ' n M%.

3.1. Eigenvalues 
At this stage it is necessary to specialize (2.11) 
to a particular periodically layered lattice. We are 
interested in the behaviour of the magnetization 
near grain boundaries and interfaces. Thus we choose 
the couplings //, // to be piecewise constant (Fig. 2):

M(l0)

Fig. 2. The special layered lattice of (3.16). In each sub-
layer the exchange couplings are position-independent. 
With this choice we get from (3.15) : 
M(2) (Z0) = A/2(« -'>) Mj"« 
(3.17) 
It is sufficient to consider only one of these two 
cases since M& (l0) and M ^ (/0) are related by 
exchange 
of 
the 
parameters 
( / i , / i , " i ) 
with 
(/ 2,/ 2,n 2) 
and suitable renormalization of /0. 
Therefore we shall confine ourselves to 
0 ^ / 0 < n 1 
(3.18) 
and suppress the superscript "-1)" whenever no con-
fusion can arise. 
The product (3.17) is most conveniently calcu-
lated by writing both Mx and M2 in their spectral 
representations 
Mi = i |/</'•>)(/</°l 
( i - 1 , 2 ) . (3.19) 
7 = 3 
Thus we need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
M t , resp., Mo. Since Mi differs from the corre-
sponding submatrix of Vf1 by only a scalar factor 
exp ( - 2 
K,) , 
the eigenvalues u of Mi are exp ( — 2 Cq K{) times 
the corresponding eigenvalues /. of Vfi, and the 
eigenvectors ;//) = /) are the same. In theorem 
3.2 we have already identified q)n and \ — q)„ to 
be the first, resp., second eigenvector of 
V„q(l0) 
(and, of course, also of each Vfi). Therefore we 
shall denote the eigenvectors corresponding to the 
submatrix Mi by |^3)=|//3), |/4)=|//4), whence

the sum 2 in (3.19). 
i = 3 
Since the transfer matrix V/ in (2.6) (and thus 
Mi) is not symmetric in the general case Ji + Ji + \

we ought to distinguish between left and right eigen-
vectors in (3.19). To evade this complication (and 
to make use of the known results of SML on V/) 
we alter the definition (2.6) into the symmetric 
form 
F / = (Vl(2)y/2 F/ 1)(F/ 2 )) 1 / 2. 
(3.20) 
This makes sense because, according to (2.7), V/2j 
is diagonal in that representation and therefore 
(3.20) has, in the product O V/, the mere result 
I 
of introducing the arithmetic mean 
7;eff =(//-!+/,)/2 
(3.21) 
instead of 7/. In our particular layered lattice (3.16) 
this comes into play only at the interfaces. [It 
should be noted that, owing to (3.21), our lattice is 
slightly different from that one treated in 5]. 
With the "effective" mean couplings (3.21) in-
troduced at the interfaces, we may thus use the 
symmetric definition (3.20) of the transfer matrix 
and take over the results of SML on the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors of M/ ^ exp ( — 2 Cf/ Kt) Vp. So we

where Re 
is given by (3.23 a) with Kt replaced 
by Kj . Since the 9? are given by (3.39/40) modulo 
rr/2 only, there should be (to fix the eigenvectors 
uniquely) 
an additional condition like (3.25 b) 
which restricts the cp to an interval of length TI. 
Later, however, we shall see that both values of cp 
given by (3.40) yield the same value of the spon-
taneous magnetization. So there is no need to fix 
an additional condition on cp in this work. 
3.3. Fermion Eigenstates 
In the following we try to interpret (3.37), in 
analogy to SML (3.33), as a Bogoljubov transfor-
mation from the r\ fermions to new i: fermion states 
(which for general /„ , of course, have to be non-
orthogonal 1 4). Using the abbreviation 
CRL = cos (<pR - $>L) 
(3.41) 
we therefore define the new operators 
I« = C r l '{VQ 
+ rl-i S-tr} > 1 
(3 42) 
«F-V = Crl 2{ - v\q S,}L + rjtq Q , } j 
and the (renormalized) state vectors

q), 
(3.43) 
and analogously for the left vectors. [It should be 
noted that these renormalized vectors satisfy the bi-
orthonormality (2.13), and not the vectors (3.37).] 
It is easily seen that the operators (3.42) obey the 
usual fermion anticommutators 
{ ! , , # > } 
{I, | f /} = 0 
(3.44) 
and that they create, resp., annihilate i fermions in 
the states (3.43). Thus a (non-hermitian!) £-par-
ticle-number operator can be constructed too: 
= £-q Sq + »g 
(3.45) 
which counts the fermions in the states (3.43) : 
(3.46) 
^ | v a c R b = 0 , 
Comparison with the eigenvalues (3.33) of V^Uo) 
leads to the following diagonal representation of 
Vn«(lo): 
V f (l0) = exp {2 C„ (n, K, + n, K2)} 
(3.47) 
X exp { - £ ( « 2 0 ( ^ - 1 ) } 
which can be decomposed into two factors corre-
sponding to + q and — q: 
V>iq (Jo) = e xP 
( n i 
+ n i ^2)} 
Xexp {-e(q) 
(l]+)I,-|) 
} 
X exp { C _ 9 K Kt + n, Ko)} 
(3.48) 
Xexp { - ? ( - ? ) ( f ^ l - , - ; ! ) } . 
Our deduction of (3.48) is valid primarily for 
those values of q which fulfill (3.31), S2(Vl_,;!-) 4= 0. 
Nevertheless, it can easily be adapted to q = 0 and 
q = TI as well, which together give the two factors of 
(3.48) if we use cos(0) +cos(rr) = 0 and define 
e(?) =2ni(K1* 
+ Kl)+2n.2(K2*+K2) 
(3.49 a) 
for 
q={», 
for all T and for q = 0,71.

(For T <TC, 
where Tc is the "global'' critical tem-
perature of the layered lattice [see Appendix A], 
the real part of one of the e(q) becomes negative 
according to (3.49 a), in contrast to the convention 
(3.30 b). Likewise 
(3.49 b) 
implies that cpn = 
(PL — 0 f° r <7 = 0, TI and for all T, in contradiction 
to (3.35). It can be shown13, however, that (3.49) 
is equivalent to (3.30 b) and (3.35) in all respects, 
especially regarding the asymptotic degeneracy of 
the largest eigenvalue of F„(/0).) In a similar man-

ner (3.48) can be adapted to the exceptional values 
q = ± 
[see (3.32) ] if we define 
e{qs) = nle1{qs)

ft? = $t(<Pi) 
, 
l u = Us (<Pi) 
for all T. (3.50 b) 
The $v(<Pi) are given by (3.42) with (p\\ = 
= 0 
[or by SML (3.33) with <p = <pi\ and characterize 
the eigenvectors of the Vi belonging to the sublayer 
(1). 
Since we now can write V„r,(l0) 
in the form 
(3.48) for all q, we have [by the direct product 
(3.11)] also a diagonal representation of f7,,1 (/0) : 
Vn+- ( Z 0 ) = [ (2 < § * * , ) ( 2 
k s ) 
" • ] ( 3 . 5 1 ) 
•exp 
where we have used 2 
c o s <7 = 0. Thus the eigen-
<7 
vectors of V ^ (/0) are simply the states of defined 
if-particle number. 
To get the eigenvectors 
of 
V„(l0), however, we have to observe theorem 3.1, 
i. e. to consider the c-parity Pc of our vectors. Now 
(3.49 b) and (3.50 b) allow an extremely simple 
connection between Pc and the "^-parity" 
= 
(3.52)

For, like SML, we have 2

q 
Pr = P„. Now (3.43) together with (3.49 b) and 
(3.50 b) leads to P, =P7, so we have 
P c = Pi 
for all T. 
(3.53) 
Thus we can reformulate theorem 3.1 and get 
T h e o r e m 3.3: The set of eigenvectors of F„(/0) 
consists of the "|-even" eigenvectors of r„+(/0) 
and of the "J-odd" ones of VH~(l0) . 
With this theorem we now can find the eigen-
vectors belonging to the largest eigenvalue of V „ (/0) 
which are needed in (2.18). According to theorem 
3.3, the largest eigenvalue of V„ (I0) belongs to the 
^-vacuum

^lmax - [ (2 § 2 K , ) ( 2 
V 2 exp { J 2 Uq+) } . 
-."T<<7 + <.7 
(3.55) 
At T <T(., 
however, we can create a one-particle 
state which has, according to (3.49 a), an eigen-
value nearly equal to (3.55). In Appendix A we 
show that it is the qc = 0 or qc = cz fermion, ac-
cording to 
cos </c = sgn [ni Jx + n2 J2) , 
(3.56) 
whose "energy" e gets a negative real part at T < T(.

asymptotically degenerate with (3.55) (in the limit 
M - + ? c ) . It is this asymptotic degeneracy which 
causes the ordered state of our lattice 15. All other 
eigenvalues of Vn{l0) 
differ from (3.55/57) by a 
factor exp £{qc) or more. 
4. The Spontaneous Magnetization m (l9) 
In (2.18) the spontaneous magnetization is ex-
pressed in terms of the expectation values of r k x r k , x 
in the states belonging to -l m a x, i.e. the ^-vacuum 
and the one-particle state 
1 q v};, 
according 
to 
(3.55/57). To evaluate these expectation values we 
write the product r k xt k , x in terms of the c s [see 
SML (4.7)]: 
rkX xk'X = n (i CjV) cj+i 
(4.1) 
i=k 
where [in analogy to (3.2) 
y I 
= C J + ± C J . 
(4.2) 
In (4.1) we have assumed k >k without loss of 
generality. — By SML (3.16) and the inverse of 
(3.42) we can express the c's in terms of the £'s: 
.C'X\ = M~1/2 2 CkL2{1/+) e '-(9;±fH-,/4) 
(4.3) 
l Cj") 
-.i<q<.t 
Here we have used the antisymmetry of (p\\ and (p\/. 
<PR,L(-?) = ~<PiuAq) 
(4.4) 
which can be seen from (3.35) and the following 
antisymmetry, resp., symmetry properties: 
<Pi(-q) = -<Pi(q); 
f.-( - q) = 
; 
e(-q) 
= +£(q). 
(£=1,2) 
(4.5) 
[These properties can be verified from the defini-
tions (3.23, 25, 30).] Since by (4.2) the cx, id'

are linear expressions of fermion operators, their 
have to consider the products of all pairings of c s, 
anticommutators are c-numbers: 
a pairing being the corresponding (^-vacuum or 
(r * r v\—(\

These expectation values in turn can be calculated 
conveniently with the help of (4.3). So we find in

Since the limit A / — i n (2.18) has to be done before \k — k'\—><x>, it is the limit of a finite sum of 
finite products of pairings. So one may carry out this limit already in the pairings (4.7 — 10). Because

(4.12) 
The differences (4.9,10) vanish in the limit 
so we need only consider the ^-vacuum expectation 
value in (2.18). [Cf. SML (4.19).] 
To take into account in this expectation value all 
possible products of pairings with the correct signs, 
we use the fact that the sum of all these terms can 
be written as a Pfaffian or, more common, the 
square root of an antisymmetric determinant, the 
elements of which are the pairings 16. Thus we get 
with the (2 x 2) submatrices

Directly from the definitions (4.11, 12) it can be 
seen that 
(xy z)*= - y x _ z ,

i.e. xy/ and yx; are real, and xx/, yy/ satisfy the

the limit of a (2 x 2)-block Toeplitz determinant. 
Au-Yang and McCoy 8 have compiled the theo-
rems on limits of block Toeplitz determinants known 
at that time. Since their determinant (3.1) of 8 [as 
well as ours, (4.15)] doesn't fit to the special con-
ditions of these theorems the authors develop a 
procedure yielding after n steps a determinant with 
the required properties, (n = nx + n.2 is the layer 
width.) Naturally this procedure is useful mainly 
for small n, and the authors treat explicitly the case 
n = 2 only. 
Meanwhile Widom 1 7 has published a general 
theorem on block Toeplitz determinants, but the 
application of this theorem to (4.15) must be de-
ferred to later work. — So we use a different way 
to investigate the position dependence of ra, evading 
the difficulties connected with block Toeplitz de-
terminants but also renouncing the full knowledge 
of 
ra(/0). 
5. Extrema of ttl (l0) 
As stated in (3.38 — 40), for l0 = nj2 
things be-
come much simpler. (For symmetry reasons, 
m{l0 = nj2) 
= : meW 
(5.1) 
is the extremal value of the magnetization in the 
sublayer (1). For odd nx, of course, ra/1) is not 
the magnetization at a real lattice site. For large n x, 
however, we can without large errors identify it 
with the real extremum.) Because of (3.38), 
<Pn(q) = (piAq) = 
rfiq), 
we get from (4.11) 
xx; = -yy, = <3,.n. 
(5.2) 
Thus the diagonal elements in 
o, (4.14), now 
vanish too, and (4.15) can be transformed by si-
multaneous interchange of rows and columns to the 
form 
(racW)4 = lim

(5.5) 
If in (5.3) the sign of — CrT is reversed the de-
terminant gets a factor ( —l) r, and if in addition 
the first r columns are interchanged with the last r 
ones another factor ( — l ) r ! results. Since ( — l ) r + , ! 
= + 1 for any r, we have 
(ra/1))4 = lim 
Cr \ 0 
"o ; c/r

(5.6) 
(5.7) 
In contrast to (4.15), (5.7) is a simple (scalar) 
Toeplitz determinant which can be evaluated for 
r—> oo 
bv 
the 
theorem 
of 
(SKB). 
Szegö-Kac-Baxter 18 
The transformation of the block Toeplitz deter-
minant (4.15) to the scalar Toeplitz determinant 
(5.7) rests upon (3.38), i.e. the symmetry of 
F„(/0). Thus for all l0 that represent mirror lines of 
a periodically layered lattice we can calculate ra(/0) 
simply by the SKB theorem. Cf. 3 ( 6 . 1 0 - 1 8 ) where 
a randomly layered but mirror symmetric lattice is 
considered. (The idea of a position dependent local 
magnetization in a periodically layered lattice seems 
to have appeared first in Chapter 6 of this paper.) 
A sufficient condition for applicability of the 
SKB theorem to (5.7) is continuity of 
f(q):=V(q)+q/2=V(q) 
+ P i ( ? ) + * / 2 
(5.8) 
in — TR q 
TI. A detailed investigation of (3.25) 
and (3.40) shows indeed 13 that for T<TC 
f{q) is 
continuous and that for T>T{. 
a jump at q = qr. 
appears (cf. the analogon of <p{q) + q/2, Figure 3). 

1476 K. Rander • Magnetization of Layered Ising Model

So we can use the SKB theorem to evaluate (5.7) 
for T<TC and get

(5.8) we change (px{q) into (p2{q) and interchange 
in the definition (3.40) of (p{q) the quantities 
[n1,

Of course (5.9) is not a very transparent result.

cannot be investigated as easy, so we cannot verify 
the critical exponent ß=l/8

6. Asymptotics of Til (l9)

of calculating the full l0 dependence of m. In this 
chapter we shall see that, nevertheless, one can 
deduce from the asymptotics of me
(^ and mj'-> for 
n1—>oo the asymptotic decay of m at large distances 
from a (1) — (2) interface. To that end we first dis-
cuss meW

Now we define the local critical temperature

In the same way a temperature 7\ 2, the local Tc

the 
nx-dependence 
of (6.21) can be shown to be 
correct (by discussion of the double integral (5.9b), 
see Appendix B). Moreover, the T-dependence of 
A(T) shows the physically expected behaviour, at 
least in the simplest case of purely ferromagnetic 
couplings

The sign relation (6.25) means that m e ( 1 )^m A

(6.26) of A(T) 
at T = TcX can be understood as 
follows: In the case TV2>Tcj we have TC>TC\ (but 
Tc.~-*-Tci for nx—^oo, see Appendix A). So mx will 
vanish at TvX while me

so

responding asymptotics of the Onsager-Yang mag-
netizations mx and m.2:

though the appearance of the exponents — 4 K in

understood.

In conclusion, there is large evidence that not

6.2. m (/0) far from an Interface 
To deduce on the basis of our result (6.21) on 
me
{1) (n1—*- oc) the asymptotic decay of m(/0) far 
from an interface, we need me'2' (rtj—^oo) too. As 
mentioned in Chapter 5, Eq. (5.9) will give mPl2) 
if we write 
f(q)=^(q,nl)+(p2(q)+q/2 
(6.29) 
instead of (5.8) and determine <p^ from (3.40) 
with interchange of (n1,e1,(p1) 
and (n2, f 2 > V-i) • 
Thus we get from (3.40) 
cot 2 <p® = cot 2

(6.30) 
( 6 . 3 1 )

where

(6.34) 
The two conditions (6.32) [as well as (6.12)] 
can, for all q, only be fulfilled for finite n2 e2. For, 
with 
XWffl!—>1 there exist certain q values with 
( sgn (Re fj)

or 
( 2 », + C2(V1 - r i) sgn (Re f , ) } = 0 
and 
S ^ , _ ^ = 0 
[in case of (6.32)] . 
Now, in the limit J2-

So, 
n 1 -- e-än.lRef.j 
for all q. Thus for ]2—> 0 the conditions (6.12) and 
(6.32) cannot be fulfilled uniformly for all q. 
[Likewise a(q) is not bounded in this case.] — 
The physical meaning of this limit is quite clear: 
according to Fig. 2, the layered lattice decomposes 
into uncoupled (1) strips of finite width with un-
coupled (2) chains lying between them. That is, we 
have r c.->0, and no magnetization will be present 
at all. 
We see that, apart from the case /2—>0, the 
Ar2<t5o mentioned in (6.32) will always exist for 
all q, i. e. (6.33) is valid uniformly in q. So we may 
take over the formalism [(6.1) to (6.21)] to the 
calculation of In me<2) (n x), replacing <f>x{q) with 
(f2{q) + (ptt{q) and <£(9, nx) with 

1476 
K. Rander • Magnetization of Layered Ising Model 1478 
Since we don't, however, explicitly know k/2\ 
the 
Fourier coefficient of (p.^ + cp^, we cannot actually 
perform the calculation. But we can infer the nx 
dependence of ln m,,,2): 
ln[ro e ( 2 )(ni)/roe ( 2 )(~)] 
(6.36) 
for 
n^oo 
with unknown B(T). 
[The same result follows from 
the double integral (5.9 b), cf. Appendix B.] 
Thus we have shown to exist a finite Nx such that 
for 
(6.21) is the leading asymptotic term 
of lnm/ 1', and a finite N* such that for nl>N.> 
(6.36) is the leading term_of ln 
Therefore 
there will also exist a finite Nt such that for n i^.N 1 
one has 
\ n [ m e W ( n 1 ) l m i ] ^ e - e < l t 
(6.37) 
and a / V 2 < o o such that for n 1^.N. 2 one has 
ln [meW M / m J V (oo)] ^ e"*? < 1 , 
(6.38) 
where Q is defined just by e~0<^ 1. Now we define 
N to be the maximum of these four lower bounds: 
yv=Max{yv 1,/v 2,yv 1,/v 2}<^. 
(6.39) 
Then we may use, for /i1>Ar, the asymptotic forms 
(6.21), (6.36): 
ln [m eW(n 1)/m 1] ~ A { T ) n ^ -
ln [m eVHn 1)/m eW(~)]~B(T)n l-*< 2 
(6.40) 
and define a AN such that for n{ ^ N + AN one has 
(6.41) 
ln[m/ 2)(n 1)/m/ 2)(^)] 
B(T) 
ln [ m P M / m , ] 
A(T) 
.e-nJ(2(T) <:e 
e< 1 . 
From this we get 
N + AN = 2ri[Q + \n\B(T)/A(T)\] 
. (6.42) 
If therefore B(T) \ < oc (which should be expected 
on physical grounds at least for ferromagnets at 
0£T<Tel) 
and A(T) +0, N + AN will be finite 
for T<T,X . Then, for nt>N 
+ AN we have from 
(6.37) and (6.41) : 
ln 
ln 
? ( 1 ) K ) 
< 1 . (6.43) 
This is a more precise statement of the observation 
that, according to (6.40), ln[/nß(2) ( n J / m P (oc) ] 
for 
decreases twice as fast as ln[m,, ^ {nx)j 
m J . T h i s different behaviour of (6.21) and (6.36) 
may be interpreted as follows: The periodically 
spaced (2) layers cause perturbations in the log-
arithm ln/nj of the magnetization of the underlying 
(1) lattice. For 
N + AN interactions among 
these perturbations become negligible, as 
(6.43) 
shows, and ln m (l0) is the mere superposition of 
these independent contributions. So one may deduce 
directly 
from 
(6.21) 
the asymptotic 
decay 
of 
lnm(/0) in sublayer (1) at large distance d from a 
(1) — (2) interface (i.e. 
nl>2d\): 
In[m (d)//nj - ^ 
A (T) d3'2 
. 
{d-+*o) 
(6.44) 
For those values of d at which [in analogy to 
(6.37)] 
ln[m(rf)/m,]< 1 , 
(6.45) 
that is, 
2 d>N + AN, 
(6.46) 
one may linearize the logarithm in (6.44) : 
m{d) 
1 + 
A(T)d-*l*e-*l$i 
. 
(d 
(6.47) 
The reasoning leading to (6.44) is obviously in-
dependent of the regularity or randomness of the 
distribution of (2) layers, provided the separation 
between them satisfies (6.42). Thus (6.44/47) is 
valid also for a single perturbing (2) layer in a 
homogeneous (1) lattice, i.e. a grain boundary. 
7. Discussion 
According to (6.47) the spontaneous magnetiza-
tion near a layer-shaped inhomogeneity in an other-
wise homogeneous (1) lattice decays, for 
exponentially with a decay length equal to the spin-
spin correlation length £7 • A similar behaviour has 
been found in the past for some other systems. 
Near the free surface of a three-dimensional Ising 
lattice at T<T{., 
Monte Carlo studies23 approxi-
mately yielded the same exponential behaviour (of 
course without any factors like our denominator 
d3 2). The Landau theory too gives such an expo-
nential decay for T<TC 
as well as for T>TV, 
in 
either case with the decay length equal to the cor-
responding spin-spin correlation length 13- 24, 28. On 
the other hand, near the free surface of a three-
dimensional quantum Heisenberg model spin-wave 
theory 2il yielded a power-law behaviour of the mag-

1476 K. Rander • Magnetization of Layered Ising Model 
netization for T 
Tc which again is accompanied 
hy a power-law behaviour of the spin-spin correla-
tion functions in the corresponding infinite homo-
geneous system26. (The only known inconsistency 
between the asymptotics of the magnetization and of 
correlations is for the classical three-dimensional 
Heisenberg model: Monte Carlo studies 23 yield ap-
proximately a power-law behaviour of the magneti-
zation whereas on the basis of transfer matrix theory 
(p. 955 in 2') the pair correlations are known to 
decay exponentially.) 
It is, however, not at all obvious that the decay 
of the spontaneous magnetization should reflect the 
behaviour of the spin-spin correlation. On the basis 
of the picture developed in the derivation of (6.44) 
the magnetization responds to the differing coupling 
constants within the inhomogeneity, i. e. a variation 
of the local energy density. Accordingly the spin-
energy density correlation 
GSE{r) =(oo Or Or+fi) 
(7.1) 
should come into play. (<5 is a vector connecting 
nearest neighbours.) For classical systems Ggp; (T 
<Tc,H 
= 0) indeed decays with the same correla-
tion length as (o0or) 
[Eq. (2.29 d) of 2 8; ch.IIIc, 
(3.17, 31, 34) of 2 9]. This would explain (6.47) 
as well as the Monte Carlo results of 23 on the three-
dimensional Ising model. For the other systems 
cited above there seem to be no results on GSE UP 
to now, which prevents a further check of our hy-
pothesis. (The results of 27 on the exponential decay 
of pair correlations hold as well for G^g • So the 
inconsistencies with the classical Heisenberg model 
mentioned above persist even when G.^e is taken 
into consideration. On the other hand, the Monte 
Carlo results of 23 yield the magnetization only in 
the 12 to 15 layers next to the surface, which might 
be too poor to make a reliable statement on asymp-
totic decay.) 
An understanding of the denominator c? 3 2 in 
(6.47) should be possible by a thorough investiga-
tion of correlations near interfaces as reported in 30 
for free surfaces.

The Global Critical Temperature Tc 
According to (3.49 a) TK is defined as that tem-
perature at which R e t ( g ) becomes zero for q = 
qr = 0 or = n. Using (3.5) we therefore have from 
(3.49 a) for T = T,:

[Cf. (31) in 4.] Since the right-hand side of (A 2) 
is positive one has 
cos qK = sgn (nt

( A 3 ) 
In the following we want to discuss ( A l ) in the 
limit n1—> oo with fixed n2, i.e. njn2—>oo. 
In this 
case <7t. — f r o m comparison of (A3) and (6.11), 
and ( A l ) 
becomes identical with the condition 
Re Et(q) = 0 for T = T?\ . Hence one has

therefore expand ( A l ) in powers of (Tc —

Using the conditions for

|A:1|-|^1|* = 0 , 
resp., 
|K2|-|K2|* = 0 , 
( A 6 ) 
one finds from (A 5) that for large n1/n2 
1. f e < r L l for r e 2 < r c l 
( A 7 ) 
2. f c ^ r c l for Tvi>Tvl 
and J J 2 ^ 0 . 
(A 8) 
Hence the naive assumption that Tc will always lie 
between 
and 7\.2 is correct only for Jt J2 > 0. 
For Ji J2< 0 even Tc = 0 is possible in spite of 
Tct 4= 0, Tv2 4= 0. To discuss this case we consider 
(A 2) for 
0 and get

is the corresponding sublayer width n1 or 
n.2. Thus the function TK{nJn») 
has a (nonanalytic) 
zero at 
njn,= 
- J j J i . 
(AlO) 
At this point the critical wavenumber qv is unde-
fined, cf. (A 3) : there is strong competition between 
the two sublayers with respect to the sign of order 
(remember that / 1 / 2 < 0 ! ) , so no order will de-
velop at all. This behaviour is analogous to that of 
the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice (31, § 3.5.4).

The integrand of (B21) has, for /V—>oo, a peak 
near £ = 0 and an (integrable!) logarithmic singu-
larity at x = l . Therefore, to discuss K(N —>°o), 
we divide the interval (0,1) into two parts (0, x0) 
and ( x 0 , l ) with fixed x0 . The first part yields the 
integral

the first term of 
(B 25) 
The somewhat strange d dependence of (B 26) de-
serves a comment. At (B 13) d was defined to be 
small enough to make possible the approximations 
(B 13, 16), so the case d-+oc is excluded. On the 
other hand <5 has to be chosen finite, so as to include 
in the regions (1) and (2) of Fig. 11 the double 
ribs of g,h , Figure 10. Only after letting nl—>oo 
d may be chosen arbitrarily small. [This way of per-
forming the limits is also implicit in (B25) where 
we have TV = d ]/b n1—> oo.] The sum (B 14) of 
course must be independent of d. This cannot, how-
ever, be shown here since for the remaining three 
terms of (B 14) only the orders of magnitude can 
be estimated, without explicit factors. 
Concerning the asymptotic estimation of these 
three terms a few general remarks must be made. 
For each (q, q) with q + q there exists a finite lower 
bound N (q — q) such that for nl>N(q 
— q) we 
have the asymptotics 
Gni(q,q) ~ 7 ( q < , n l ) ~ - 
a(g<)e~n^<^ 
(»»!-*oo) 
(B 27) 
with q< chosen as to make [ q<\ = Min([ q |, | q |). 
For q = q and q = q + 2 7i, however, one finds the 
limit (B 12), i.e. 
Gm (<7> q) ~ 
~ - ( « ' - " i £ a) 
e-"'lI{e£il 
( n ^ o o ) 
(B 2 8 ) 
which for nx—> oo predominates over (B27) at all 
points q = q ( ± 2 .i) where e (q) a (q) 4= 0. So we 
have a similar non-uniformity problem here as is 
possibly present in (6.15) : for q — q-+Q the lower 
bound N(q — q) for the asymptotic approximation 
(B 27) approaches infinity according to 
N(q-q) 
-QHq-qtfeJdq]-1 
( q q ) 
(B 29) 
where 
1 is chosen to be the magnitude of the 
relative error neglected in (B27). But in the pre-
sent case we can estimate the effect of this non-
uniformity since we know the limiting behaviour 
(B28), and thus overcome the problem. We simply 
have to exclude a small stripe of constant width 
surrounding the lines q — q = 0, ±2 71, from 
the behaviour (B27), see Figure 12. (For sim-

behaviour like (B 28), say 
G n ^ n ^ e ' 1 1 ^ ^

(B 30) 
is assumed, the asymptotic order of magnitude of 
the corresponding integral (B 5) will be an upper 
limit for the order of magnitude of the real Tx .

(B 32) 
Since q < d<q in this area one can neglect 9?(g, 
compared to <p(q, nx) which can be approximated 
by (B13). Further one may replace (px{q) + q\2 
by ((pi +1/2) q according to (B16), and replace 
the denominator of G,h by the truncated expansion

For those values of q for which x(q) 
= -f Ö the 
g-free term in the bracket of (B 33) yields no con-
tribution to the q integral, whereas for the remain-
ing q values one gets from this term a contribution 
of the order

i. e. the same order of magnitude as T ^ , 
since 
F (q) has no zeros inside (<5, n). Finally the con-
tribution of the hatched corner has to be estimated. 
Up to a factor independent of n t , the integrand 
will be of the order (B 30), i. e. 
n 1e- B' a e ' b n ^ l 2 
(B 37) 
in this region. Since the area of the corner is chosen 
independent of nx the integral over this corner will 
be of order (B 37) too. Thus (B 36) is the leading 
term of T/*>:

we first discuss the un-

the boundary q = d:

whence the integral over this area is of the same

Now from (B 26) and (B 36) both terms are seen 
to have the sign of a0 (cpx +1/2). So they do not 
cancel, and the nx dependence of (6.21) is proven.
